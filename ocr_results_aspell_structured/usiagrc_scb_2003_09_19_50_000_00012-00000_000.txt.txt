Plans
problems
had been
addressed

My name is Jonathan Kensler, and l am currently in charge of
plans, 1 wish to first say rhankyou to the numerous people who have
given theirsuppotr to Plans as well as support to me. I continue to be
amazed by the students, alumni, faculty and starfar this college, 1
have unrorrunarely become tarher disenchanted with the adminis-
rrarion.

The article on Plans in the S&B on September 12 as well as
lefrrcy Bergman's letter to the editor seem to
beg a response and clarification on my part,
speciﬁcally, I seemed to be accioed ofdoing
nothing in response to the February meeting
between Bill Francis, Dean l<rohn, Mr, stone,
and 1 There seem to have been three points
that Mr. Francis brought up iii the meeting:
removing guest access, stopping Plans from
being indcxcd by search engines, and pitrrtng
some actual parts of the Academic computer
Use Pollcy on Plans.

1 have never been a fan or guest access on Plans. thn Rachel
Heck was running Plans and 1 was only a Plans user she added in
guest access into Plans. 1 came very close to leaving plans because of
the addition otguest access. When I became in charge ofPlrns how.
ever, I came to see that there was a real value in having guest access. It
has allowed users to have a place in which they can easily lcr not only
friends on campus know what is going on in their life, but has ale
lowed other people such as family or friends at other schools to see
what is going on in those users lives. Mr, stone and l were unhappy
with the prospect ofrcmoving guest access completely,

I have felt that my work
was speciﬁcally targeted
by the administration,
despite their denials.

Opinion

Previous to the February ineerrng, there who only a simple rc-
rtriiider (and link) on the welcome page of Plans reminding users
that they were bound by the Academic Computer Use Policy. l was
rcquotcd to put actual parts oftlie Academic Computer Use Policy
on Plans. l replaced the simple reminder with the exact parts rliatl
was requested to add, on the welcome page where the previous re.
minder had been and not err the front page.

I felt frustration at tho and of the semester and into (it: summer
in dealing with Bill l-‘rancis in regards to Plans issries. In one case I
was sent an email in which he indicated that he wanted a student’s
Plan account to be disabled bccausc thc student had a threat on his
Plan. I complied and disabled thc account, but looking at what had
becn written, I had doubts as to whether what was writtcn could
constitut: a threat, and emailed Bill Francis about my doubt I nwer
received a response.

During the summer a faculty member wrote rpiestionable things
on their Plan. The ﬁrst word I received on this was in th: form ofa
carbon copy or an email that Mr Francis had sent to the faculty
member requesting the removal otlrbelotrs writings on that Plan. I
wrotc air ciriail back to Mr. Francis indicating that since he had ale
ready staricd communications with this facility member, that he
should Ict me know iic nccdcd hirthci action on my part, such as
disabling the faculty members account, I received no response to my
email The meeting in which I was ordered to take- Plans down on 6
hours notice was days later

in that meeting one ofrlie reasons that was indicated as to why
Plans was being shirt doivn were technical problems, Bill Francis was
informed that those technical problems had been taken care of, and
Bill Francis indicalccl that ho was not aware that those technical prolr
Icms had been resolved. The problems had been resolved 7»8 weeks
beforehand The administration seemed rather surprised by the ic-
sponse of the commiinrty to having Plans be forced to be taken down.
I cannot help but to conclude that the administration ofrliis college
decided in take down Plansivithout cvcn knownig
much about what it was.

I hate relt that my work was specifically tare
geted by the administration, despite their denials.
The modiﬁcations to thc ACUP were in csscnce
announced at the mectritg in which l was ordered
to shutdown Plans andgivcn as reason to shut down
Plans. Plans was the only protect to be shut down
at that time under thc ACUP (and as Far as I know
since then 3 well), it seemed to be poorly written,
having far brondcl rcpcrciissions than intended
These things in combination make it very much sccm Iikc the changes
to the ACUP were put in place to specifically target my work

In the meeting in which Plans was shut down. I learned that
apparently there had been a few more complaints about Plans be.
fore l Felt a doc}: frustration and wondered why the administration
had never bothered alerting me or these complaints, and why the
administration was not letting me even try to handle problems tee
suiting from my work.

\N SPITE a? THE TENHiS

In my opinion, the current ACUP is oppressive, and l believe
that the changes to the ACUP are quite short sighted. The world or
computers is quickly advancing. In many areas, programs are limited
more by imagination than technical limitations. The difficulty or
writing a progmm such as Plans is not great, and continues to de»
crease. With this greater ability to program things easily, Grinncll is
likely to see more such programs in the ruturc. The ACUP needs to
be changed so that it is not simply containing a few oppressive prohie
birions, but instead should have a framework for interaction between
programmers and users offutine programs and I‘I'S. such as letting
the creators or programs try to handle problems from their programs

ﬁrst

I know that many ofctiiineli's racuiw reel uncomfortable when
it comes to computer marrers. However as creating programs such as
Plans becomes less and less technical, nraiiy of the problems that will
arise will be social problems and because of this 1 would like call
upon the faculty (not just (:3 faculty) to become more involved in
both determining and running computer policy at Grinnell as 1 bar
lieve that even non-tccltnically oriented hiculty have much to cont
tribute in social wisdom,

Editor’s
response

In response to Jeffrey bergman's Sept 12 letter to the editor, l
would like to make a clarification There wciescvetal editor ial changes
made to Lola Gircia’s article arrer she submitted it, including soitte
additions The line Mr bergman quoted, “Francis did not offer any
reasons for the order during his meeting with Kensler." was one of
these additions. As the editor in charge other article, I rake responsi-
bility for that line and regret that it was added without Ms. Garcia's
knowledge and may have distorted the article, This wao not, ofcourse,
the goal The editorial staffar the 5&5 tries to work closely with
writers all through the editorial process However, due to time {:7
strarnts and poor communication, last minute changes are occasion»
ally iiiadc without the writer's consent, l=or rhis reason, it is safer and
more accurate to direct criticisms ofarncles toward the editorial staff
and nor the individual writer, That said, i regret that the article left
unanswered questions. we are always tiying to improve the quality
orrhe SM}, and we will continue to do so in the future.

and so attempted to reach a compromise The come
promise that was reached and seemed to be accepted
by all present parties was that guests by detaultwould
not be able to read a user's plan unless that user changed
a setting to make their plan viewable to guests Within
hours Plans was altered in this way,

Even hereto the February meeting, I was attempte
ing to make Plans not be iiidcxcd by search engines
(most notably Googlcl. Despite roilowmg instructions
on how to stop indexing, my attempts to stop the i
drxing ofrlans did notwork. After the meeting, l at.
tempted to stop the indcring again, but was again frus-
trated in my attempts, especially considering that it
can take a month to see it any one attempt works
What am I to do ifl follow a search engines own in-
structions oti stopping Indcxlng and it doesn't work?
