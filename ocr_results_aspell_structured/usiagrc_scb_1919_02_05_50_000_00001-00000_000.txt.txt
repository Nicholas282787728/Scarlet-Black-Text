KEEP IN ‘SlEP WITH ‘

Sass Everything Tllztt Does Not Keep
In Line will lie Overwhelmed.

“Keep 111 step with the march of
cosmic events,” was the warning given
by Professor H. S. Canard in his VeSr
per address Sunday. “Otherwise your
destruction will be sudden and com-
plete," be pointed out.

Prolcssor Canard spoke or the
"wrath of God" which according to the
old testament made itself felt in the
destruction of Sodom and Gamniurah
and in other deeds of swift and violent
destruction.

In the some way, be cxplztincd, every-
living thing that does not keep in line
with progress will be overwhelmed by
the onward march of events. In illusr
tinting the point, Professor Canard
mentioned the species 01‘ mighty trees
which covered the eluth in ages
gone by but whose descendants are tor
day limited to the source and lowly
gynho tree. other plants which were
among the least significant in these
past ages are the rulers of the plant
kingdom at present because they lrcpt
in step with the march or cosmic
events. He showed that this same ex-
perience was true of animals and nat-
tions, As a last stop he pointed out
that because autocracy was out of step
it had met a sudden and terrible late
in the recent War.
