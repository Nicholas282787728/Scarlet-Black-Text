THE ENEMY IS OURS

The baseball game which was

while the total of the locals' hits
amounted to thirteen, Coe barely
getting eight.

er of the day, his work at the bat
proving. exceptional. Out of a
total of four times at bat he see
cured a home run, a two-bagger
and a single. swalm tollowed
closely with three hits, while
Wilder did the best work of the
season with two. S. Benson got
two, Willett, B. Bcnson and Bar-
ber each one. Howard and Wile
lett were responsible for the only
errors of their side.

Swalm went into the box for
Grinnell, and except for occasion-
al wildness l'airly eflective.
The crisis of the contest came in
the eighth inning, when with the
score ro-g, two men out, and two
on bases, a Cue batsman landed
squarely upon the ball. whichsail.

DEBATERS WILL BE REWARDED.

The Union Takes Action in Regard to
Honor EmblcmSu-A Committee
Has Been Appointed,

At a recent meeting of the Des
batingUniuna committee was ap-
pointed to draw up some plan and
to adopt some pin or medal by
which debaters should be reward-
ed for their debating.
The plan is similar to that now
used in Athletics by which the
winners are given an “Honor G.”
It is to the best interest of deb-att-
ing that more men should enter
into the contests and it is cxpecb
ed that by a little inducement
this interest can be aroused. The
work at the debating teams is
dillland monotonousand even then
their honor is slight as compared
with that of athletic teams. No
action lras yet been taken but the
committee is preparing a plan
which will probably be adopted.
A pin or medal will be given by
the Union to all the winners in the
inter society contests. This will
be a slight recognition [or their
services and Ought to induce more
men to take up debating work.
