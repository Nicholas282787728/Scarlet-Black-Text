effect at requirements on a student's
health He asked whether there was a rela-
tionship between the recent tightening oi
the grading system and an apparent in-
crease in end oi semester health problems
among students He argued that re
quirements were likely to raise anxiety
levels among students to an even greater
degree

The meeting came to a close with an ad
monition from Professor at History Daniel
Kaiser that the debate resembled a

religious wai- more than it did a rational
discourse He argued tor a systematic and
critical analysis oi the issue, breaking it
down into manageable parts and working
irom there. protessor oi Classics Gerald
Lalonde responded that Kaiser‘s remarks
were the least ablectlve and most emOr
tional he had heard.

The meeting adiourned it had not been
decided whether the issue required iurther
general discussion or whether the taculty
would move towards action on the pri}

No nasty letter to President Reagan
Joint board defeats resolution

by M. Woltgaug schumann

A sarcastic resolution submitted by
Ethan Cohen condemning United States
support tor the government of El Salvador
was tabled indefinitely because oi its
"somewhat comical manner" at this past
Wednesday‘s .ioint Board meeting. The
Fall 1983 budget was reapproved with
substantial cuts due to a miscalculation oi
income from Student Activity Fees,

The debate on Cohen's resolution did not
once directly bring up the issue or
American involvement in El Salvador: 'l
centered on whether or not Cohen had pur-
sued his political goals correctly in the
words of VicerPresident Pele Hautzmger,
"Writing 'a nasty letter to Reagan' is not a
very oiiicial way to pass a resolution
i'm bothered by this because it‘s written in
a somewhat comical manner."

Cohen's resolution read as iollows.

Since everyone knows El Salvador is rul-
ed by a fascnstic [Sic] right wing regime
which has a complete disregard [or human
rights, and that the economic system there
resembles feudalism more closely than
anything else;

Let's his talks be resolved to condemn the
United states for its unconscionable sup-
port ior the ruling clique in San Salvador.
Let‘s also be resolved to write a really nas-
ty letter to President Reagen [sic] con-
deming him tor this misguided ioreign
policy. Let's iurther be resolved to write
letters to House and Senate leadersasking
them to cut off all funding for military aid
to El Salvador.

Thank you ever so much.

Cohen explained that he was only doing
what David Kopelman had trial to do at
the SGA meeting two weeks ago,
Kopelman had presented a resolution con-
demning the Soviet Union ior destroying
the nowriamous Korean airliner; that one
was deieated 155, with {our abstentions.
Cohen was one or the tilteen that opposed
the measure, in part because it did not
recognize what he felt were the excesses of
United States ioreign policy.

"There was concern about the activities
of some of the other governments in the
world. The reason I feel this is important is

that this is our government," said Cohen,
who represents residents oi oitcampus,
collegeruwned housing. Hautzinger, who
had encouraged Kopelman's proposal,
said that he was “kinda torn by this
ll'esolutionl,” Hautzinger had said before
that he wanted Joint Board to get more in
volved in important political issues, but he
was not impressed with Cohen‘s attitude
nor his style. The resolution was deieated
overwhelmingly in a voice vote.

The Fall budget, which had been approv»
ed last spring by last year‘s SGA ad-
ministration and on 14 September by this
year's Jomt Board, had to be revised
because or an error in expected revenues
from Student Activities Fees. The original
budget called for an income of $53,689 50,
which represented $48 50 collected from
each of 1107 students Since enrollment is
down substantially from last year, SGA
was at that point already iorced to make
signiiicant cuts due to a decrease in lees
collected. But sometime Since last
Wednesday, it was discovered that the
$48.50 iigure was in error and should have
been $46.00 per student, which raulted In a
total income for SGA oi $50,522.00 — close
to three thousand dollars short of what was
expected,

Contributing to the problem were other
exogenous losses to SGA. it no longer gains
$2000 in income from running shuttles [0
Des MDines on breaks. SGA now also picks
up the ﬂab [or the Grilillell Review and for
some oi the security costs at allrcampus
parties, both new costs totalling $271M

To counteract the deﬁciency, salaries
lor top student positions were cut an addi-
tional iifteeen percent, after having lost
ten percent irom last year in the previous
ly approved budget. Hall funds were out
also by $500, which amounted to loss than
fifty cents per student. (Cohen protested
this and said that the money should come
out of security) $500 was also cut (ram the
Concerts budget, and the last 515 came
irom General Budget. ,

No one was particularly pleased with the
new cuts, at course, but Treasurer Robbie
Sckalor explained honestly that “We did
not Check that [activity [eel figure 7
which is our mistake,” Mike Marcus,
Younker President, agreed with the loss of
hall funds, saying "It's a cut that aiiects
everyone."

False alarm in Cleveland Hall

by Amy Amabile

Someone pulled the tire alarm in the
stairwell oi Cleveland Hall last Sunday
morning at 2:35 a m., iorcing residents out
onto thc loggia ior ten minutes, and
resulting in the summoning oi the tire
department by a Sludenl. B&G otiicials
said.

it was a ialse alarm. but the student who
phoned the department “called in good
iaith," said Bob Townei'rLarson, Assistant
Dean of Student Aiiairs, so no pumlivc ac-
tion will be taken against her

According to Gerald Armenl oils&G. the
only way to summon the the department
in case ol tire is to telephone them The col
lege's alarm system is not dirccily linked
to the lire department,

A iine oi lll'ty do ars has bccii levied

residents at Cleveland third have been
charged hity dollars more because the
alarm on the third floor was found to have
been tampered with, according to the
lalest SGA minutes

Gail Fisher of Cleveland 3rd has admits
ted to doing the tampering, however, and

More changes come
to food service

by Ellen riekalkiewicz

Changes in Food Service this year,
although minor in comparison to last
year‘s renovations, have nonetheless air
iected Grinnell students, The changes in»
clude new soit drinks, longer lines at
Cowles, increased congestion at Quad,
lower revenue tor tood service, and new
regulations tor student workers

Both dining halls this year otter new soft
drinks. One oi the complaints made by
students is that the selection does not in
clude a caifelnated-sugared cola

Director oi Food Service Dave McCon-
nell explained that the reason Grinnellians
must now drink Like Cola instead or RC
Cola is that the Mid-Continental Company,
Grinnell's current soitdrink supplier, lost
its rights to supply RC, and thereiore
substituted Like Cola,

McConnell stated that be anticipated the
negative reaction to the Like Colas, but
that he regards the students response to
be a result or conditioning; he also believes
they will get used to Like Cola. He added
that the lack oi caiteine is hardly
noticeable since a caffeinated cola coil»
tains merely onertwelfth the amount oi
catteine that is found in coiiee.

McConnell said he regrets not having a
real cola tor the students. However, tor all
practical purposes, Grinnell students must

. ted, sugared cola

oi) r<

He added lhatth'c ing halls still serve
Dr. Pepper. Though not a' cola, it is one of
the most highly caiteinated sodas on the
market today.

Long lines at Cowles, most notably at the
last special dinner, have been an inconver
nience to many students. Freshman Wen»
dy Hamaker Said, “I was rather irked that
the line went so slowly.”

McConnell said that the long lines result
from the increased number at people at
lending meals. Last Wednesday's special
dinner was attended by 97 percent oi all
the students on board At previous special
dinners only 90 percent or the students
have been in attendance McConnell said
he could not understand why people would
stand in line at Cowles for so long and not
walk over to Quad. He said he is planning
to post signs reminding students that lines
are shorter at Quad

Quad Congestion

Congestion has increased at Quad
because one tray breakdown area has been
removed. So Quad, as Paul Commiiis put
it, is "one or the tow places you have to
stand in line to leave.“ McConnell said
Quad will remain the way it is, at least toi-
this year.

McConnell said lhe lower revenue for
food service, which is due to declining
enrollment compared to past years. \\ ill

not aiiect this year's menu instead,
changes will take place only in iood serr
vice procedures, Cooks will have to watch
the iood line closely to minimize waste.
This practice, which limits the amount of
food cooked in advance, has already cauSr
ed a slowing of the line because students
wait long it something runs out, said
Cowles Di ng Hall Manager Barb Shell.

Food Service Stall will also Concentrate
more on what is being wasted by students.
McConnell provided statistics showing
that the incidence of waste is high

At Cowles, waste is roughly 20 percent
and at Quad 11 percent. McConnell said
that he hopes students will take these
iigures into consideration and try to waste
less food. He said that this would be ex-
tremely helpful, especially this year when
revenue is a little low. McConnell added
that the ma Jar savings needed ior food serr
vice to stay in the black will result from a
limit on renovation programs or im-
provements in equipment this year

McConnell said that food service this
year will be more conscious of safety and
cleanliness than it has been. A a result,
workers must wear some type of hair
restraint, an apron, and closed-teed shoes,
These regulations, which have been on the
books ior years, will now be more strictly
enforced.

Although the student workers complain
about these regulatons, their actual

behavior has not changed much, Junior
'Beth DeLarco sai , “I was surprised when

'1 ﬁrst got here two years ago that they did
not have any regulations, so i regard the
ones now as part of the job."

The Health Department inspects Grin-
nell‘s l’ood service facilities once a year. In
the past their interest has been “getting
the old equipment up to snuii," McConnell
said. Now that improvements have been
completed, healui and saiety regulations
must be emphasized. McConnell said since
Cowles and Quad are public places the
stall is accountable and must have high
standards.
