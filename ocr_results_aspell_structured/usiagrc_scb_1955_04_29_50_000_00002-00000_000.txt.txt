“Hall Picnics..

It was the consensus of opinion of the 8&3 staff
Thursday night that ”hall picnics“ are all right and that
they added one more of the many social experiences which
we have had on this campus. Although technically not lllegv
al, most of the “hall picnics" are looked on with disfavor
by the administration.

This timeless tradition of hall enterprise seems to
bring a new light in old grads as well as present students.
We’re not quite sure what causes this light but according
to an exvpl‘esident of one of the men’s halls, picnics create
a form of unity which is not equalled by any other event.

We’ve seen the picnics. Any form of hall unity is lost
ten minutes after the party is over. Why food is necessary
at all we don’t know. Some people suddenly find it exciting
to drink after having done it for the past eight months.
Others attend to try it for the first time, Some initiation.
They let their hair down all right but is it necessary to Oil
the machine thoroughly before it will go. We condemn the
“picnics” in favor of something more creditable such as

open houses and houseparties.

Congratulations

Taken from the WILLIAMS RECORD of Williams College.

Witha definite amount of mixed emotions. the REC-
ORD would like to add its name to the long list of well
wishers of Professor Howard R. Bowen who recently ac-
cepted an invitation to become President of Grinnell Col-
lege. The invitation is a welledeserved opportunity for the
young professor of economics.

But we at Williams cannot allow Mr Bowen to depart
from the local scene without sincere regret. Mr. Bowen has
been a hard working, devoted instructor who has never
been too busy to give counsel to inquiring students. A man
of exceptional patience, Mr. Bowen’s aid and consideration
have become an important part of many Williams’ men‘s
education during the last three years.

Mr. Bowen has in his Williams’ stay earned the label
that ranks above all degrees, He has been a ‘ue educator.
Williams will miss a gentleman of great ability and quiet,
friendly manner. Congratulations. Mr. Bowen. We know
that you will be a success in your new position as You were
in your much too brief stay at Williams,

The Sound
and
The Fury

by Art Travers

Last week it came lo my sl-
tentioii that Herman Salinger of
the Modern Foreign Language
Department had resigned his
position. Although it may be out
of place in a column of this sort,
i should like to make a few res
marks about Mr. Salinger,

Grinnell is proud of the fact
that it is a. small liberal arts
college. To my way of think-
ing, one of the supreme advan—
tages of small liberal arts
colleges is the opportunity for
close student-faculty relation-
ship. Although there seems to
lie 3 lamentable lack of these
relationships, due in no small
part to the sligma attached to
a student participating in such
intercourse, Mr. Salinger never
lost sight or the fact that he
was here to be a friend as well
as an instructor.

A genuinely approachable and
cordial man, Mr. Salinger ipOSs
sesses an earthlness and sence
of humor, combined with im-
mense eruditioni There is not a
particle of pedagogery in his
make-up. His hand is out to the
student, he he German major
or someone else laboring under
the burden of his language res
quiremeni. As a counselor he
ranks with the best of them,
aiding and encouraging the stud-
ents in his group to the very
limits of his fine ability,

As an instructor he endeav-
ored to supply the student
with as much of the back-
ground os was necessary for
his (the student’s) comprehen-
sion. This led to digressiuns
which worried him, since he
was not completely sure of
their relevance. lie need not
have been. The sludy oi Ger-
man came to life under the
magic wand of his cultural and
historical information. it was
no longer o strange cipher in
a textbook; it represented the
advancement of a nation and
her people. ML Salinger's own
interest was conveyed to the
student.

A Versatile man, he doubled in
brass as an instructor in the
Camp. Lit. department, He is
luellrknown in circles outside
Gl'innell for his poetry (his book
”Angel of Our Thrist" is obtain-

able at the bookstore) and as a

Letters

To the editor:
All year long it has been
ollr hope that following the

tradition of the 1953 Cy-
clone, we might be able to

get the annual out on time.
It is with regret that we an-
nounce that such a hope has
been shattered. Hope
be accompanied by vi
and hours of hard work. The
latter did not come as abun-
dantly and smoothly as it
ought to. Of course it is easy
to pin the blame on our
printers for they are such a
large corporation, and are unr
willing, but also unable. to give
us special attention. We might
mention the delay caused by
iuniors and seniors wanting to
have their pictures retaken or
by having sent home their
proofs for their parents to
choose had postponed asking for
them as a major cause; or we
could emphasize the early dead—
lines imposed upon us and over
look the fact that we lacked
sufficient foresight.

Basically, since it was im-
possible to have half of our
pages into ui- printer's hands

translator. For example, he once
translated a pDEm lby the leading
German contemporary, Hesse,
and sent a copy to the author.
Hesse was so pleased that he
asked Mr, Salinger to translate
the rest.

I, tor one, wish on, Salinger
good luck in whatever enterprise
now clamls him, but i feel sin-
cei‘e sorrow in his leaving. Grin-
nell has not only lost a fine
professor, but the studets have
lost a friend among friends and
Ind a man among men,

by December in? Myers veg:

book 00. fooled us and we
fooled ourselves into believing
that we could make up the
delay. Actually all of the stair
cooperated extremely well
alter Christmas vacation and
by March 28, our final deadv
line, we had all of our ma-
tcrial in. Unfortunately, only
or few can understood how
complicated it is to print and
bind c book, and even given
two months, a large firm can’t
make up all the time lost.

However, the damage has
been done and we must make
good on the alternatives open.
in a recent poll. a majority of
students voted for a fall de-
livery book in 1955, We are
taking the liberty of putting
this year's book in the same
category. or course this means
a delay in receiving the book.
Seniors and transfer Students
will have their books mailed to
them at the time the books ar-
ﬁve on campus. To try to make
up for this injustice, we are
adding extra pages which will
be placed logically before the
epilogue, and will feature this
year's spring day and Com-
mencement, and perhaps our
new president

This means that for the first
time in years, the class to
graduate will have pictures of
its own commencement, The
book will be a complete re-
port of the year 5455, not
breaking off at Spring Va-
cation. Since Myers Co. is
willing to give us a slight dis.
count for changing to a fall
delivery, we will hove funds
for mailin books to seniors
and transler students and for
