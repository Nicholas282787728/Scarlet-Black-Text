 

Report on drawing board ‘

by Bob Mitchell

The Curriculum Committee is
still in the “drawing board phase"
with its drait report on general
education, says committee
member Terry Walker.

The committee last night heard
from faculty members regarding
its drait proposal on general
education, which calls for the
establishment of a 12 credit
distributional requirement within
each division, a “suggested
program in general education,”
and a week-long convocation to he
held in the spring.

THE COMMITTEE has already
discussed its proposals with the
Curriculum Council.

The committee has not finalized
the report yet, and is “amenable to
changes in the proposal," said
Walker. . ,

WALKER SAYS THE commie
ttee's final report shouldn't be
ready until the end oi the month.

“We're not in the final stages on
the project,” she said. “I wouldn’t
imagine we could get it to the
faculty before March 1.”

THE REPORT CALLS for Set'
ting distributional requirements
because “many students were
taking almost all of their work in
two divisions."

Thirty-five students irom the
1977 and 1978 graduating classes
had no credits in “either the
humanities, social sciences or
science div' 'ons, With 53 students
had onertorfour credits within each
division.”

 

 

THE REPORT SAID these
statistics “posed a problem” for

the college,
”A liberal education has to be
something more than any

collection at courses taken at a
liberal arts institution. Some
breadth of study is essential and
our present requirements are not
achieving that adequately."

THE REPORT, however,
stopped short or requiring specific
courses because at “presently
available staff and diversity of
student educational goals,"

After examining diiierent ways
in which “a minimum acceptable
breadth of experience" could be
achieved, the committee deClded
upon the 12 credit requirement, the
report says.

THE 12 CREDIT figure was
chosen, the report adds, “to insure
that a student would have more
than a single year course within a
particular division."

Slightly more than so per cent of
the graduates in 1977 did not
comply with the committee’s
proposed requirements.

DAVE WICK. A member of the
Curriculum Council. said the
council members generally sup-
port the concept oi a “breadth of
education" but disagree with the
committee concerning require-
ments.

“Generally, they're in favor of
the idea behind (distributional
requirements). They agree a
liberal arts education involves a
great area of study, but they object
to the notion of requirements

within each division.

definition of liberal education has
not been easy.

“I don't think anyone has ever
come up with a llice, clear
deiimtion of liberal education,"
she said, “When you get back to the
nittygritty, it’s very diiticuit to
define people have their own
impression on what constitutes a
liberal arts education.”

Women journalists View professio

Although opportunities for
women in'journalism have been
improving, the chances for ad-
vancement still do not present “a
rosy picture", says Dix
Hollobough.

Hollobough. a member of the Des
Moines Register staii, and iormer
Grinnell College Associate
Director of College Relations Ruth
Prescott, recently reﬂected on
their own careers in discussing the
progress of women in journalism.

HOLLOBOUGII, WHO is
currently assigned to the Leisure
Section of the Register. says pay
and assignments at the paper are
balanced between the sexes.
Beginning her career as a copygirl
in the 1950‘s. she subsequently
worked on financial and business
sections and on the paper's teature
magazine.

During the 50’s, Hollobough said,
women were sent to report on
centenarian birthday parties and
keptaway from stories oi violence,
politics, business, and education.
They were instead placed in

women’s departments dealing with
home, family news, and features,

HOLLOBOUGH SAID today the
paper has a woman as Assistant
Editor of Politics and another
woman as editor of the Special
Section. Other women are in the
sports and photography depart-
ments.

Prescott's career began on a
Maine daily paper as a school
reporter. She felt her ad-
vancemens in the eight years she
worked there were the exception
considering the discrimination in
pay and assignments [or women at
that time. Before retiring, she
worked for twentyrtwo years as
editor of the Grinnell College News
Service as well as Associate
Director of CollegeRelations. She
said during her tenure in these
positions she saw the gradual
elimination of discrimination in
pay and in the allocation of
reporting assignments

PRESCOTT AND Hollobough
agree on the strategies for women
to become involved in journalism.

is slow, but a bachelor's degree is
necessary along with summer
internship experience, a field
specialty, and genuine interest.
Ms, Prescott, who noted that
qualiiications are more stringent
today. said a liberal education was
necessary along with a high degree
of literacy She also said mem-
bership in the professional
organization Women in Crime
munications. Inc. could be helpful.
THIS ORGANIZATION parallels
the male-oriented Society of
Professional Journalists, or Sigma
Delta Chi. The woman’s society
began in the i920’s at the
University of Washington under
the name of Theta Sigma Phi. Both
oi these organizations had chap-

Prescott ran the women’s

said women who were members

careers. Some Grinnell graduates
who are in journalism are Sue
O'Brien, 3 news director at the
Denver radio station KOA,
and Sue Taylor, a night editor for

uates have entered journalism
as teachers and advisors to high

chaired by Charles Bear, said
Clotfelter. But Kurtz said the
nature of thls advisory role won’t
be determined until the first joint
Board-faculty committee meeting
Mar. 2. '

It is not yet known it the com-
mittee will have veto power over
the Board committee's decision, if
the committee will select a slate of
candidates, or if it will make just
one recommendation to the Board
Kurtz said.

THE FACULTY COMMITTEE
was chosen alter two ballots from a
field of nine candidates. The
first ballot narrowed the field to six
candidates, while the second ballot
named the final four.

Each ol the committee members
elected were part of a ”Slate"
presented by the Faculty
Organization Committee Friday,
Wayne Moyer, a member of the
organization committee, said the
group selected persons who have
high prestige among the faculty,
are well-know to the Board, and
represent each of the academic
divisions,

“THE ONLY CONSTITUENCY
we felt were important to
represent were the divisional
constituencies,” Meyer said.

 

Moyer added a “high com-
mitment" to the college was
another consideration of the
committee.

TIIE ADVISORY POWERS of
each committee should be defined
early in the selection process and
lines of communication should be
kept open. said Arnold Adelberg,
who chaired the 1974 Faculty
Search committee. Kintner added
the iaoulty. committee should
gather ideas from both faculty and
alumni on the type oi person to be
considered and report irequently
to theiaculty on the progress of the
presidential selection.

In the last presidential selection
process in 1974, the faculty worked
closely with the Board, jointly
establishing specifications,
reviewing qualifications oi all app
licants and then agreeing upon
those to be interviewed. Adelberg
said applicants were then in-
terviewed, frequently by
representatives irom the student,
faculty and Board committees.
Finalists were invited on campus
for two or three days of campus
hours and interviews. Each
committee submitted their
recommendation to the Board who
then made the final decision, said
Adelberg.

Board fires Montoya

said, stemmed from his enforce
ment of Pub rules. He said he ran
into problems early last semester
because some members did not
know Pub rules and reacted
negatively when they were in.
formed what the rules were.

To solve this problem, he says he
asked the Board to come out with
some iorm oi membership manual
detailing the rules. Although he
says the Board reacted positively
to the idea, the manual has yet to
appear.

He said he also had problems
dealing with members accused of
breaking rules, When he suspended
memberships and the members
appealed to the Board, Montoya
said he felt the Board was putting
him, not the member, on trial.

After a recent such incident he
said, "I lost all confidence in their
ever supporting me."

  
 
       
       

While feeling all of these things
added up against him, Montoya
said he thinks the real reason he
was fired was because of dif-
ferences in the management team,
As the management contract was
set up, Montoya was “manager"
with Tom Kozal and Ann Desmond
“assistant managers,” out
problems plagued the team from
the start, Particularly, Montoya
and Kozal had problems working
together.

Several Pub workers agreed
with this. They felt the Board had
agreed with Kozal over Montoya,
and the matter was “pure
pnlitics.”

Some felt the Board was biased
against Montoya. "They lired him
because the didn't want him here,"
one person said. Montoya, the
person ielt, was not liked by some
customers because he “enforced
the rules while Kozal didn't.”

“The Pubt’this person said, "will
go crazy now that the ‘eniorcer’ is
gone Some oi the rowdies were
Just waiting [or this."

Other workers felt that Mon»
toya's departure wouldn't
drastically hurt the Pub.

Desmond andKoLal both said the
Pub would be able to run well in the
future. While Kozal declined to
comment on the situation in the
past, Desmond did say relations in
the past were “tense," and that she
thought that the Board's action
was “not really fair to Tony.”
