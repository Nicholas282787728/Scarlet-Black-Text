Presbyterians Deiealed. old Fashioned
Fourbal Uscdl.

- Once more has Congregationalism
triumphed aver Presbyterlauism and
this time by a. Score which though
not large is decisive enough to wipe
out the memories of last year’s defeat
and the Presbyterians are tickled
that it wasn‘t bigger (or the wearers
oi the scarlet and black certainly are
some football Learn. '

it was straight football, not any of
tile ”new mngled" forward passes or
double cross plays that won the game
for Grinnell. Tile Coe men put up a.
plucky light, but they were unable to
get under and Stop the terriﬁc pound-
ing of their tackles which they receiv-
ed attire hands of the Grinnell backs.
Only once did Grinnell try a fol-ward
pass and that with onlya moderate
success While all Coe’s boasted tricks
and passes Were blasted in the bud by
Grinnell's excellent team Work and
the interference and team Work on
plunges and short end runs was a
marvel to her most ardent supporters.
> At the beginning of the game Grins
nell defending the west goal kicked
OK to Goa, who returned the ball to
the center. After three downs One
was forced to puut and on the ﬁrst
down, Marshall gained dity yards.
Grinnell was now ileld and failed ata
limp kick. From this time Grinnell
gained mostly by sendingZiegler, Barr
and Bleamuster into the line With an
occasional wide quarner back run.
Finally after several processions down
the ﬁeld only tolose the ballon downs,
Bleal‘nlster went over for a. touch-
down. Goal was missed and the hall
soon ended with the ball in Coe‘s pos-
session in Grinnell territory.

When the Whistle blew for the sec-
ond hall the Grinnell men nearly took
the (loo players or their test by the
ferocieLy of their play, and set the ball
spinning down into Coe’s territory on
short end runs and smashes over
tackle and guard. Finally Coo got un—
deruealh the Grinnell backs and held
them ior downs. But the smashing
process was again resorted to when
002 had punted out into the Open
ﬁeld again,apd soon Marshall broke
around Con‘s left and on a. quarter
back run for twenty yards cndatouch-
down. Goal was again missed. The
ball was in Grinnell’s possession near
the middle of the ﬁeld when time was
called. Sooro Griunell 10, (loo 0.

The feature of the game was the
Work of the Grinnell team Who
showed a, helping Spirit which was ex-
cellent and no particular players can
be singled out for mention excepting
perhaps Garner, Marshall and Ziegler,

FREDERICK WARDE'S ADDRESS

Delivers an Excellent Lccxurc an shake-
speare [0 Fair Audience ar
Herrick chapel.

Monday evening at the chapel oc-
curred the ﬁrst number of the lecture
course this year, when Frederick
Warde spoke to a fair Sizer] but
apathetic audience upon the subject
oi Shakespeare.

Promptly at eight o'clucl: Mr.
Wards appeared and was introduced
by Professor Ryan in a tow well
chosen words. The lecture began
with a well presented biography ol
Shakespeare's life. Then the ques»
blon of "Who Wrote Shakespeare?”
was discussed and the answer given
that none but William Slmkespezre
was the author of the Shakespearean
Drama. The sources of the plays of
Shakespeare were pointed out and
discussed at some length. Then Mr.
Warde made the statement that,
with but one exception, Shakespeare
was the greatest apostle of Christian-
ity the World has ever seen. To sup
port this statement he recited
passages from the plays of Shake~
speare, relating both to religion and
to philosophy. The lecture was closed
byaiew remarks upon how to read
Shakespeare. First Shakespeare
should be read for the‘setting, then
[or the philosophy or subject material,
and lastly for the beauty and the
pocsy. .

AS a. lecturer, Mr. Wards combined
the art of the actor with that or the
public speaker in a most pleasing
manner. The passages which he re
cited merited an applause which the
apathy oithe audience did not give
to’them. Seldom has Grinnell heard
a. man the equal of Mr. Warde recite,
and it is to be hoped that they will
never again receive such good work in
such Silence. In the lighter character-
izations Mr. Wards was also most
pleasing. In the lecture proper, lie
wasaliltleinclined to be dramatic,
possibly due to the many years which
he has spent in the atmosphere of the
stage.

If this number of the Lecture Course
may be taken as any criterion of the
remainder of the course. the com-
mittee is to be congratulated upon its
success in securing such talent, and
the course is Worthy of a much
heartier supporh than the audience
Monday evening would indicate it is

recei ing.

MR. WARD THE GUEST OF THE
DRAMATIC CLUB.

At the Association rooms, on Mona
day afternoon, acompany or sixty or
seventy people gathered at the ins
vitction of the Dramatic Club to meet
Mr. Ward, theshakespearean lecturer
or the evening. Mr. Wards stood
near one or the open ﬁreplaces talking
in his genial way to an ever widening
group, and givingthe impression, by
some iudennablc quality or his dev
ligliiiul manner, that he was receiv-
ing valued friends belors ills own
hearlli,iristead ol chsnce acquaint
ancss in a. public building.

The more forms! part or the aliair
was begun by Miss Shutts, Instructor
in Picno, who played very beautilully,
and accompanied Mr. Dcvis in three
songs which he sang with discrimiua~
tion. Mr. Davis then brienly intro-
duced Mr. Ward who spoke for some
time With earnestness and the power
ol ﬁrst hand knowledge upon the
drama as it should be, and the drama
as it isin modern lire. The contrast
he drew between these two conditions
was starcllng, and the blame he very
justly laid not upon the managers,
not upon the actors but upon the
play going public who patronize
musical comedy and show hysterics
at the expense oi the legitimate and
poeticcldramo, Mr. Ward was very
positive and very convincing in his
statement that the dramatic art is
the greatest or all arts since it
epitomizes illlthe ms, and that as
such its power of universal appeal is
more concrete and direct than that or
church, the school, or the press. In
conclusion, the actor plead' earnestly
for the supportoi educated people to
the educated stage, from which lor
lhslaok oisucli support he himseli
had been compelled to retire or lower
his intellect and manhood.

The company broke up almost ini-
mediatly alter the conclusion or Mr.
Ward’s talk but the impression of an
earnest, honest artist pleading [or the
lile or the art he has loved and served
will he a lasting ons.
