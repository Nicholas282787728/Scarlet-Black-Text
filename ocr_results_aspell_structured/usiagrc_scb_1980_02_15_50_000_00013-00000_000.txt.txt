Carter Godwin Woodson was born of
exsslavc parents near Canton, Buck-
ingham County. Virginia, November
19, 1875. He titted himseli from a hum-
ble background to become one this nas
tion's most noted and respected
historians. He attended Berea College
and received an MA degree from the
University oi Chicago, While working
on his doctorate at Harvard,

Woodson studied under Pro-

fessors W,B. Monro and Edward
Charming Woodson's dissertation,
“The Description of Virginia,” was ac-
cepted at Harvard in 1312 in fulfills
ment of the requirements ior the
degree or Doctor oi Philosophy.

Aiter serving as professor at
Howard University, Woodson began to
use his tools of historical scholarship
to begin a career of examining the
roots of black Americans—and in the
process destroying some or the myths
concerning their heritage.

Woodson was very instrumental in
stressing the literacy oi the slaves:
“In Spite of their high rate of lip

literacy, many siavcs wrote letters

which have been preserved in several
repositories...Woodson led
the way in 1926, when he included
seven slave letters in his pioneering .
volume, The Mind of the Negro as
Reflected in Letters Written During
the Crisis, 18004860.” (Blassingame.
SLAVE TESTIMONYi In the words of
Kelly Miller, Woodson’s dominant pur--
pose was to turn his
historical training and preparation to, ,
the best racial account “Dr. Woodson
retired from teaching to devote all otm
his time to research in connection with,
the Association [or the Study of Negro ,
Life

In the 1922 edition of THE NEGROv
IN OUR HISTORY Woodson wrote _
“in the proportion as Americans and-
Eurupeans become removed [rom
such nonsense as the Nordic myth and .
race superiority, they will increase
their interest in the history at other
people who have accomplished just as.-
much good as they have. So long hanr »
dicapped by this heresey, however, -
they still lack the sense of humor to
see the joke in thinking that one race
has been divinely selected to do all of
the great things on this eat th and en-
joy most or its blessings
