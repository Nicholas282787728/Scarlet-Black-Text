'WE CHEER FOR THEE’

‘ Space does not allow this newspaper to go
into the detail it wollld like ill praising the
performance staged on Ward field last
night. To say what we would like to say

. would take more space than these columns
allow, but we shall say that “that same old
loyal spirit" prevailed last night as a glori-
fied Pioneer team left the field after hav-
ing amassed the largest score made by a
Grinnell football team ill a decade.

To Coach Guy Lookabaugh and to the 34
members of the Pioneer team, we offer our
congratulations. Such a performance is in-
deed encouraging to Grlnncllians who have
been long accustomed to the hard fight for
every victory.

We deeply appreciate, also, the spirit and
enthusiasm displayed by the student body
as a whole. Such a spirit has not been
known at a Grinnell football game on the
home field for many years. Ill the last is-
sue of the Scarlet and Black, this newspa-
per editorialized to the effect that organ—
ized cheering sections are greatly needed
for football games here. Through the ef-
forts of the men’s Honor ”G" club and the
campus pep committee of the Student Coun—
cil, our plea was surprisingly fulfilled.

Grinnell last night also witnessed a spec-
tacle which it will not soon forget. The col-
lege band, nearly 50 strong, larger, more
powerful, more energetic than any band on
this campus in nearly ten years, sat on its
platform ill front of the stands, seated ill
professional style, and played with more
enthusiasm than ever before. On the field
at the half, every column and rank in per-
fect alignment, every step of every player
marching in almost perfect cadence.

The Scarlet and Black can now proudly
editorialize about Grinnell’s band; and we
can say that, at last, our band here is a
recognized unit making 21 place in the band
for a musician as an extremely high honor.
This newspaper, in the past several months,
has been rather strong in its writings about
the band; but we have been working for all
ideal—the ideal of seeing our band once
again in the recognized light where it right-
fully belongs. ,

' This ideal was brought to realization by
the students of Grinnell college and by
Mr. Robert S. Vagner whose prime interest
here has been the development of ‘the band
into a top ranking organization.

The Scarlet and Black now feels its duty
on this one thing is nearly finished; but as
a. last means of expressing our appreciw
tion, may we thank the students of Grin~
11911, the administrhtion, the Young Men’s
Christian association for its enthusiastic
support of the band and for the honorary

urdny, sea,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

dinner given for band members in the men’s'
dining room Thursday night, and, last but
not least, Mr. Vagner, who has made the,
successful start of bringing our one great
ideal to an indeed heartening close.

ZERO Hilllli APPROAEHING

Within a month a major election of uni
usual importance will have taken place.
From East to West and North to South
Democrats have laid aside their intcl‘nccine
warfare to defend themselves against the
Republicans. And the Republicans all over
the land are somehow or other combining
fantastic pension plans with demands for
sound finance. They are out-promising the
New Deal, while promising a balanced bud-
get and reduced expenditures

Aside from the usual quota of screwy
promises, attacks, and countcrvzittacks, the
big question of this election is, “What is
to become of the New Deal?” That the peo—
ple are not as thoroughly sold on it as pre-
viously seems evident. But it is also evident
that they haven’t been enticed back into
the Republican camp. So, for lack of a bet-
ter place to go, we guess that a majority
of them will stay where they are. The
Democrats will win probably, but by re-
duced majorities,

Barring ullfol-sccn unhcavnls, it seems
that Roosevelt will try to conciliate busi-
lless, and by sympathetic utterances one
courage it to expand. He needs prosperity
during his last two years in order to justify
the previous six. Behind the scenes, at»
tempts will be madcvto curb monopolies,
and make effective the new Federal regu-
lations governing minimum wages, maxi-
mum hours and child labor, which become
law Oct. 24. Ac revision of the Federal tax
structure is in sight to make its provisions
more equitable. There wll be a greater den
pcndence than over on income taxes. And a
crop of pension plans will plague the new
congress.

MUSlC, MAESTRO!

It is Friday afternoon and Friday afternoon —————7

is always a time to be lived through and
especially after a 3:30 class whose instruc—
tor didn’t hear the 4:30 bell; so that when
it is over at last and the instructor isn‘t
apologetic, only annoyed that you were rest-
lcss, there is the hour and a half till dinner
longer than the four hours that came be—
fore it, and there is only one thing to do
because you remember you can listen to
records on the Carnegie set ill the music
building from Monday to Friday at 4:30
until six—you know, because you saw a
sign telling you you couldﬁand you go to
hear Tschaikowsky’s Sixth because it is as
moody as you feel and you start across the
campus.

And before you get there you begin to
have doubts because the band is practicing
in the music buildillg (“Music, Maestro,
Pleasel") and although the Tschaikowsky
records are loud they’re only rubber after
all and the band is right there in flesh and
blood; but the sign said Monday to Fridays
from 4:30 to six, so you believe it and
climb the three flights of stairs hoping
there won’t be anyone else there wanting
to hear the ”Rhapsody in Blue,” and at
the top of the stairs you are out of breath
and the band is playing louder and louder
and the door which is between you and the
phonograph is locked and now the band is
playing ”A Tisket, A Tasket” or maybe it
only sounds like “A Tiskct, A Tasket,” be-
cause you are 50 mod.

So you go downstairs and look at the bula
lctin board as you leave and it says Mon-
days to Fridays from 4:30 to six and it is
five o’clock on Friday afternoon and the
band is playing and of course no one wants
to hear records when he can hear the band
practice (“Music, Maestro, Pleasel”), so
you go to the White House and drink a
coke and it is still more than an hour till

dinner and if you put a nickel in the White
House machine it won’t play Tschaikowsky.

Music, Maestro, please! even at five
o‘clock on Friday, especially at five o’clock
on Friday. Please!
