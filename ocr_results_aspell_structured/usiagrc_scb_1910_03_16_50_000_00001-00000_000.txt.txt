Physical training has iiow become a
part of the regular our- icrilnrii in near»
iv all schools and colleges, and the
importance or the work as a counterace
tion to the daily mental strain or the
average student cannot be overestir
mated. Tire idea in this work is not
in make athletes but to give sane and
normal training along lines or physi~
cal development. For this reason there
is very little use oi the heavy appara
tus, the class devoting their time
mainly to door work, That the gym-
nasium work here has become system:
atized and tilled with new interest and
enthusiasm, under the efilclent and
conscientious leadership of bliss no
person is felt strongly by every girl in
college.

This exhibition closes the year's iri-
door work and outdoor cliisse will be
organized at once in tennis, iield

“The Element oi Personality."

tion from Iowa. ,

At the meeting of the Religious Edu»
cation Association which was held in
Nashville, Tenn, last week, Prolessor
Fitch oi Oheriln College, read a paper
on student self government. The idea
that he emphasized thruout the paper
was Cooperation. He believes the
old idea, oi conducting the college as
an absolute monarchy presided over by
the iacnlty is impracticable. He also
criticized the laxity in government as
it exists in a great many places. The
ideal condition as outlined by Profes-
oor Fitch is very much like the plan
Mr. Main is endeavorlng to put into
actual operation in Crinnell.

The club has been practicing consists

trope to make this year's concert one oi
the very best ever given. The program
is to consist almost entirely oi new
numbers, excepting, of course, some oi
the Southern songs and a few other
01d~llilie enoores that Crinneli people
wish repeated each year.

The club has decided to eliminate
the “bawleorrts” this year. They hirve
made ample provision, however, for
lighter nnrnbers, and hope to present
something more original, and more
pleasing to the n'udience than the usual
”slams."

An entirely new arrangement or the
program, togetiier with the high class
or new music it contents, will add
not a little to its interest and artistic
merit.

171 core of Good Scholar-
ship.

A committee representing the Col-
lege cottncil and the faculty has just
completed a plan ior the regulation or
outside activities during the coming
year. The need for some sort of regu-
lntion in this phase of college life has
been felt some time and this action
promises to result in a very material
improvement in the existing conditions
about the college so far as amount of
participation in the different activities
is concerned.

As the plan is now worked out each
student will be limited to a total of
25 hours of college work and other in-
terests except in the instance of schol-
arship or an average grade of B in
which case he may have up to 30 hours.
Freshmen will be allowed but 22 ex-
cept, where they are working for their
board or room ill which case at the
discretion of the committee in charge
the total number may be incl dsed
to 2.“.

To each at the driiorent interests
about the college a certain numerical
number at hours has been given. This
schedule has bcon submitted to the
presidents of the different organiza-
tions i’or suggestion which must be sub
lllilu‘tl during the next tno weeks. At
this time the committcc will go over
the plan again, make any modiﬁcations
that may be desirable, alter which the
plan will go to the college council and
the iacttlty for final approval,

This plan wit. be administered by a
Joint t'onlmlLLee of the faculty and the.
council which will be composed of ﬁve
members two senlors and three face
ulty.

All organizations are to keep this
committee informed whenever any
change is made in the amount of work
that is done by any of its officers. To
supplant this the committee is re-
quired to lteep on ﬁle a list of the
college men and women and Just how
touch work they are carrying at any
given time.

and may be depended tipon to put up
a good debate. Those who have heard
the previous lntei'sacademy debates
will not want to miss this contest and
it is hoped that many will take advan-
