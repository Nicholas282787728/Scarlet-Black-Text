by Tuesday ELCili/lg’ gel/«27'!!! U11-
17ln‘clnssﬂlcil N0! Here.

If any one should (lollllt that the
success of Grillnell College in the re-
cent endowment campaign and iii ath-
letics and other branches, uds iii-lug-
ing its results, he should wander
through the Lihlllry at almost ayn
hour and see the swarms 0i students
Crowding the radius [01' registration.
Although it i too Dill'li' to obtain very
.ficzrlll'ille es lllllff‘s til' the attendance
’ . your, the exceptionally large
i‘egist «tiun that has been going on,
proves that it will show a substantial
gain over former years. More than tWO
hundred Freshmen have registered and
many more are expected to do so by
tonight.

While, of course, a few of the old
‘lstudeuts have not returned this year,
the number is quite small, and the
three upper classes will no doubt share
-the general prosperity.

one of the interesting facts about
the new class just coming in is that it
has ropi-es

:ﬂhtlves from a very wide
ter

tory. rinnell is attracting, more
and more. the students form the lid
joining states. Especially Minnesota
“lms increased the number of its dele~
‘gdtion, and there are students from
many other states, both far and near.

Another iact worthy of note is the
unusually large proportion of boys in
tho clil‘s or 1313. Whether the splen-
did Iecortl which Grinnell made in ath-
”etics during the past year is responsi-
ble or not, is naturally impossible to
detainnne, but it is safe to say that
‘lhis had some influence ‘

l Although there

 

are many piomis—
‘illg atliletcs included in the new list,
‘Lhem are dsbators as well, and men
who sire promise or making good in
iii. c A. n'Ol'li and other activities.
lei-o y year brings to the college a
linger number of men with records
behind them, and the new class is not
an exception to the rule.
‘ Altogether, the indications are that
the season oi isosriaio uill be a Veri-
nablc rcooi tor, and that the Col-
lege is being rccoinpeiiscd to. the many
good men who graduated by having a
,vci-y promising aggregation of new
