Review Council Dutiesr, Shortcomings

Having

the choice or
for Studeht Council
it would seem an—

that I should riolv
make clear what I intend to
accomplish. I do not thinlr i
need devote what little space I
have to listing my attributes. If
I did not believe i possessed
the qualities inherent in lead-
ershlp, I would never have sub»
mitted my name as a Candi»
date. Nor do I feel if. is here
necessary to record my contri-
butions to the Campus. If I

made

First, I propose a new sys-
tem of selection or so repro-
sentatives. The selection

'would not he on an' elective
basis, but rather a person
qualiﬁed and interested would
apply to 'his house council,
which, with the council presi—

ready be aware oi my works
and it is tor you and not inc
to judge their merit.

What 1 lmvz; to say . . .
my platlorm it you wish , . .
is torinuluted on a problem-
solution basis (and here, too,
it is your decision as to the
value oi the very problems I
choose to discu. 7. Number
one problem is the interest in
and eliectivcness oi the Stu~
dent Council. I believe that
this prohlem can he alleviat—

ed in the following ways:

i. Representatives being re
sponsible for posting weekly roe

ports of the meeting, and tale

(lent,' would approve and ap-
point him as the hall repmr
sentative. Thus the student
Council would have interested
and enthusiastic . members.

I propose to place more active
power within the council by
federating the Central commit—
tee, Board of Student Organi-
zations, Board or Student Publi-
cations, Calendar committee and
other such groups into one Body,
which would be under the lead-
ership of [capable omcers and
iacutty advisership. Thus petty
problems such as those which
have iaccd the council in past
years would become unimpor-
tant.

I feel that jhe membership

rug with the parties they rep-
rcscrit should he of concern to
the council.

2. A knowledge or Roberls’
Rules on the part or the prcoir
dent, plus a prepared agenda
which would leave room lor
the discussion of any new
husincss which the represen-
tatives and visitors would care
to suggest.

a, Eireetivc use ot the coup-
in order that
the committees might deal prop»
only with important issues oi

oi the council should he re-
viscd to include presidents or
selected members irorn certain
student clubs and organiza—
tions. '

If elected, i would strive ior
better attention to both the
men’s and women’s dorms as
iar as room cleaning. bed makr
ing and general iurnishings
are concerned, a revised system
for mailing laundry by estab-
lishing a substation at the
bookstore; making the bookstore
into a cooperative student store
for the college, and a car rule
’to includc both the seniors and
iuniors.

These are just a law of the
many points that. I wish to pros

pas-e to the students, and I ask
their opinions and remarks cunr

campus concern,

4. Closer connection with ad-
minis ration and loc_irlly in or-
der that what is ot interest to

the campus is not ronlined to

5. 1(5an used 15 one of
the CDulIt‘il’s primary publim

I admit to generalities in the
previous lineup. but brevity
does not indicate. incapahihty.
It is my helm: that it is pos-

a great deal more than “a cohe-
maehine operation.”

But if you want to enjoy smoking as never before,
switch to Camels. Nothing else tastes so rich,
smokes so mild. Today more people smoke Camels
than any other cigarette. The best tobacco makes
the host smoke. Try Camels and you’ll agree!

If you answered “No” to all questions, you obvi-

7 “No" answers mean you better get on to Camels
