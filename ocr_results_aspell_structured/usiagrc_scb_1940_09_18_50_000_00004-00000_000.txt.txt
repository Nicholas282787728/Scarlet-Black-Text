O A Privilege Awaits

Traditionally, appropriately, these first days
of the academic year at Grinnell college are
days of welcomeiwelcomes sometimes of-
ficial and perfunctory, but more often warm,
informal and friendly. Already this wel-
come has been extended to those students
becoming associated with Grinnell for the
first time. And tomorrow other welcomes
will he made at the services customary upon
the first days of classes.

But before the occasion passes, we too,
wish to extend our welcome—a welcome to a

all are entitled to its enjoyment. Through
circumstances beyond their control there are
others to whom its benefits are denied. But,
here, only indolence can deprive one of its
returns.

It is a great and precious privilege with
which our welcome is concerned. There are
those who have died in attempts to prevent
its being taken from them And upon the
foundation of their sacrifices others have

built for the welfare of mankind, ol'tilnes in
the face of persecution and deceit.

But in spite of their toll, it is a privilege
which may soon be denied even here at
Grinnell. Other privileges are falling, hour
by hour, in this, the erstwhile land of privin
leg-es. Perhaps the privilege of which we
speak will be the next But, as yet, it exists

And we welcome all Grinnellians to err

the privilege of seeking out the truth for
yourself—the privilege of freedom 01'

O The Real Issue

In his speech at Coffeyville, formally in-
augurating his campaign, Wendell L. Willkie
set forth what is to him—and to all those
appreciative of our democratic liberties—
the cardinal issue in the 1940 presidential
election: Is this nation to continue as a
democracy or is it to become a victim of
the worldwide trend toward totalitarian
ism?

From the moment of the slightly odorin
ferous nomination of Franklin D, Roosevelt
for a third term in the White House, the
Scarlet and Black has regarded that ques-
tion as of paramount significance ill this
year’s presidential contest It is thus grati-
fying that the man with the greatest 0131)01"
tunity of preventing a fascist answer to that
question has recognized the danger inherent
ill the third term and has assumed the task
of averting it.

By those who, from variolls motives, ill-
clllding a gratefulness for material rewards
and a blind sense of party loyalty, support
the candidency of Mr. Roosevelt we shall be
accused of possessing too vivid an imagina-
tioni Perhaps that is so. We, :5 mllch as
they, should like to believe it so.

But we do not For even a remote ac-
quaintance with history reveals too many
instances of olle~man rllles, the records of
whose growth are alarmingly similar to
that left by Franklin Roosevelt in the past
seven years. And in all such cases the
danger to democratic processes lying in the
concentration of power in the hands of one
individual was not recognized until it was
too late Even the peril of Adolf Hitler to
democracy was tittered at until it was too
late

Fortunately, it is not yet too late for

Capitol Hill. In fact, there are
certain qualified observers who
feel that Hitler would much
rather be in Russia.

the long

Invasion Hysteria
Seen as Misleading

Campaign Issue

By qut-m o. M.
Since before the pro-convention
political maneuvering. it has been
morbidly intriguing to observe the
progress of the Rooseveltrencourr
ogcd hysteria that is enveloping
jittery America.

And, hinged as it is upon the
belief that a doomed England’s
fall will be closely followed by a
Nazi bombardment of New York,
this hysteria hits a new peak
with the explosion of each Ger-
man bomb in London. But even
granting, for the solos of argu~
ment, that the collapse of Great
Britain is certain—a premise
open to increasing doubt—a. dis.
passionate analysis yields stleast
three factors arguing that much
of the German menace has been
created to aid Roosevelt's strug-
glc to retain pcwcn

First, consider the military
impossibility of an immediate
Nazi attack upon this hemisphere,
Even with the (lemons in con-
trol of European waters—some-
thing they neither possess nor
threaten to obtain—the multitudl—

German spade-work before the
luvoslon of the near and non-n»-
sisting Scandinavian countrlcsod
the preparations for the long-
hcroldod channel crossing as proof
of this observation) Moreover,
note the immense dlfflcultles in-
volved in maintaining an effective
German force for from its Euro
pczn or Afr-lam bases Especial-
1y would this be true in the face
of thc nchlvc opposition of the
United States flccc opcrztfug
from its original and recently 30-
quired bases in the Atlantic,

Second, although superﬁcially
victorious on the continent, Ger»
many has acquired responsibility
for millions of hungry aliens, ofr
ferlng fertile ground for paralyz-
lng unrest. The problems of re-
construction and reorganization
are far more likely to hc of imr
mediate concern to Lhe Nazi high
command than a gooserstepplng
against distant and powerful
America,

And third, it ls scarccly prob-
able that Hen- l-lltlcr has for-
gotten his orig-incl] and oftd-e
pmtﬁd desire [or the rich and
fertile Ukraine At least, the re—
cent spurring for pos' 'on in the
Baltic and tho Bantams by both
Russia and Germany would lend
credence to thc vlcw that a Ger-
man more to the cast is next on
thc docket—not the invasion of

encsmped
than in his present relation with
an uncompromising British rhu-
pile.

Thus, while ll. behooves the
United States to engage in care
ful and adequate preparation for
the defense of the New World
against possible eventualities, the
puerility of scare-mongering is
evident. It Will be a sad com~
mentary upon the intelligence of
the American public if the most
promising activity of that type is
allowed to continue beyond Nor
vcmber.
