WITH This issue we bring the
work of the term to a close, well
satisﬁed with our relations with
the students this term, and heartir
1y appreciative of the support giv-
en by them. To one and all we
extend the greetings of the sea-
son. with the hope that they may
return from a pleasant vacation
prepared to renew the relations oi
mutual helpfulness.

THE EFFORT Prof. Cole is mak-
ing to secure ior the students and
people or Grinnell an exceptional-
ly high class of musical entertain-
ments for this winter. is certainly
a most commendable one and
should receivethe hearty support
of all those concerned in the inur
sical interests of Grinnell. Should
tour hundred subscriptions at one
dollar and a half be secured, the

series will be given. and with suclL

artists as Villa Whitney White.
Leopold Godowsky and the Spierr
ing String Quartet, all oi national
repute, there ought to be no ditr
ﬁculty in ohtaining the required
number of subscribers. This will
be a rarc privilege which ought to
be readily accepted, and the plan
should receive the hearty cooper
ration of all.

A CAREl-Ul. examination of the
markings submitted by the judges
on the oratorical Contest might
well warrant the student to draw
some startling conclusions. Per
haps one reason ior the wide die
vergenee in the markings on
thought and composition is to he
noted in the fact that no deﬁnite
system oi marking is ioiiow'eti by
all three judges. They are mere
ly instructed to grade the orations
on the scale of 100. ll some defr

 

inite scheme tor rnar t igwere fol-
lowed by all the judges on thought
and composition. there might be
assured a iaii-er- grading and truer
estimate of the merits or each 0an
tion examined. The prcsciit sySr
tern seems to leave too wide a
mziigin tor individual preterenees.

A R MELANCF. to the contest
lasl. year is to be noted from the
fact that the winner owes his Vice
tory decidedly to his delivery
markings. The oration
marked third on thought and
composition. An opportunity
will be givcn to recast the oration
somewhat. before it goes into the

was

. printer‘s hands, and seems to be

an opportunity of which the urn
tion stands in need. This has
been one fault with previous Cone
tests. and one ol the prime reasons
ivhy we have failed to get intothe
ﬁnals at the state contest, namely.
haste in composition, This was
true oi the winning oration last
year; it was composed almost enr
tirely in two weeks and was prini'
ed on the night of the contest.
With more than two weeks for
further work. it seems that the
Grinnell oration ought to be put
into such a shape that it shall not
meet the late which has overtaken
similar cfiortsirom this institution
in recent ye' s.

riot. Norris' papel on “Regenr
eration," delivered before the Sci-
entiﬁc Association Thursday even»
ing was listened to with great in
terest and brought forth a lively
discussion. Prof. Norris showed
that the regeneration of parts was
in inverse ratio to the complexity
of the organism. He began with
the salamander. showing that it
may be deprived of seemingly ln’le
portant members, a leg or tail for
instance, and its remarkable pmw
ers of iegeneration are so great
that in an incredibly short time
the member Will grow again ape
parently as good as ever. So on
through the scale. the powers of
regeneration becoming less as the
subject becomes more intelligent.
until we arrive at man whose pow-
ers ot regeneration are least oi all
animals. Why lliislossofpower?
In taking on other attributes vast-
ly more important. man has lost
thislessimportantattribute. line
had this power in the same degree
as the salamander we would be
salamanders.
