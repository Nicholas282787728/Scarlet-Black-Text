that's why President Ferguson has
supported it so much."

President Ferguson has decided to
pay for most of the costs of the first
Carnival with money from herdiscrc-
tionary fund. After the first year, SGA

The event ts being advertised
through the Grinnell public schools,
and groups from town have been
asked if they would like to participate
in the Carnival,

As with most major Grinnell
events, the Carnival has had its share
of scheduling problems. The current
date istheday afterWaltz, which has
been criticized because of its placing
two major social events in the same
weekend, making studying for up
coming exams at tight squeeze. The
event had to be held late enough so
that there was a chance of warm
weather, and so the last weekend in
April was chosen, Unfortunately, the
date forWaltz has been changed three
times due to conﬂicts with passovcr,
the spring play. and the pig roast. and
