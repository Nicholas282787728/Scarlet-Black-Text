’ “Honesty in Advertising" is the title of an article in
a recent issue of the NATION disclosing with a careful
thoroughness characteristic at that radical little magar
zine, the alarming misrepresentations made in nationally
known ndVel‘Ilselllents,
the NATION are backed by proof enough to satisfy the
most exacting. The author, speaking of his writing,
says. “It is a briet crossrsection of socchlled national
advertising in our better-class popular magazines, and
contains, it seems to me, an appalling indictment of
American business honesty,"

For instance. the \vellrklloun soap advertisements,
"99-100 per cent pure" was admitted by its makers upon
close questioning to be only a slogan, not a guarantee.
From the American Medical Association Bureau of lue
vestigatiou came the following answer as to the relialiile
ity of another advertisement: “The Listcrinc advertising
on the dandruft feature is of‘the same kind as the Lister»
ine advertising for halitosis and body-odorsilargely bun-
coinbe." After examining an official tabulation made of
17,000 policy holders of‘the Metropolitan Life Insurance
company, the author found that contrary to a certain oth-
er well-known advertisement that “four out of five get

No. 3.

Furthermore, the statements of ‘

pyorrhoea,” one out of twenty is more nearly the truth.
Numerous other advertisers were found to be entirely
(also.

Aside from the conclusion that tl ‘s an appalling
indictment of American business honesty, it encloses also

a story of human in us. Probably ninety per cont of
all i iders of such adrci scincnts digest them as gospel

truth, It is a psychological fact that the human eye,
seeing a statement in print, r ~el, question its reliabib
ity. Advertising int-n have recognized this fact and have
profited heavil thereby. Once more Barnum is right,
except that he should have said of us, “There's two born
every minute."

('OM'H \ 1‘1 HI, [ANIS‘L

Years ago when football was in its comparative in-
tanc coaches were of the prize-fighter, hardboilcd. Jer-
sey swathetl type, who came on the field, not so much to
develop men as to teach them the finer, or cruder, points,
of canvasering technique. At this time little or no u'flinr
ing rules were required of the men,

Later on the game, becoming more scientific, requir-
ed more scientific coaches and with their coming arrived
the overhead game, complicated rules and open style or
play. One feature of this scientific inaugural was the
increased and concentrated system of training regula-
tions, Training tables were set up allowing the candir
dates to eat only certain things, training houis were
established and the men were ordered to be in bed at a
certain time each night. They were told not to do this,
to do that, _to be careful of their bodies at all times, and
the rules became even more involved and more complis

cated. In short, they were overtrained.
All this would have been very good, if the main pur-

pose of the institution had not been lost sight of. Cole
logo is to train men not merely for the present but more
primarily for the future, and all these regulations tended
to restrain the waters of will-power until finally, reach!
ing dnrestrainable limits, they burst through the weak-one
ing dam. Then the damage amounted to more than the
previous good, At the end of the season the men reverted
to relieving orgies of physical enjoyment.

ilr. watts training rules as announced to his men
are as sensible as any We've yet heard about. He seems
to be making football not the main part of college life,
but just one phase of Its kaleidoscopic whole. Instead
of eterstl'essing, notice, not the importance of training,
but oveiutrainiug, he is trying to leave his squad with a
strengthened control at the end of the season instead of
a weakened dam that bursts as soon as given a chance.

As a matter of fact, Coach watt appears in all his
“my: to be an extremely level-Headed and intelligent
coach. He is of the quiet type, and really finds time
to make friends of his students. One of the most cons
rincing arguments as to his character is the sincere esA
teem with which his Des Moines Roosevelt high school
protoges hold him. We predict that next year when the
students will have had time to become acquainted with
him, Watt will find one Of the largest squads of football
men at his command that Griunell has ever known.
