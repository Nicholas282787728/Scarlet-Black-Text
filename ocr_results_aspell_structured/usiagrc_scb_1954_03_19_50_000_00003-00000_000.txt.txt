According to an editorial

science students performed the,
best attendance, while the art
students attendance was the
lowest. Law lectures drew the
largest audience However. most
students found the lectures uses
less, and felt that their inde-
pendent study provided them
with more knowledge, Klausner
stated.

Only two examinations are

students in constant study. They
take their studies very sel'iollsly,‘
Klausner said, and assume at
vast amount ol responsibility for
them. 1
When asked it these ideas i
could ever work in the United 1
states, Klausner responded:
“The British student receives
a highly superior preparatory
training. Here in the U, s. we
have to spend two years teach-
ing the students what they
didn‘t learn in high school
“The British student is al~
ready learned in these subjects
when he enters college, thus
accounting for their advance in
intellectual maturity. To make
this plan work in the United
states, it would take many
years of building up the high
school educational departments.
