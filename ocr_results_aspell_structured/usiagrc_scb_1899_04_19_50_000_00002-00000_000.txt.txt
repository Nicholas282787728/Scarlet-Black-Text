THERE SHOULD be no need in
these columns to urge the stue
dents to attend the Greek play
which will be given next week.
No one can fall to appreciate the
fact that this is an opportunity
which he cannot afford to miss.
The settings and spirit ot the
play is so entirely Grecian that
no lover of the Hellenic language
nor any one who has read the
Odyssey can help looking for
ward to the production of the
play with intense interest,
those who have scarcely any
knowledge of Greek language or
history should consider tltem~
selves indeed fortunate in having
such an opportunity to get an in-
sight into one of the greatest liter--
ary masterpieces of all times.

THE SUPPORT ivhich our baseball
teams of the past few years have
met with from the students has
been sliainetul, and itwe expect to
have any games scheduled here in
the future it is time that we wake
up to the fact that the students
must attend them in larger
bers. This year the management
has secured tour oi the best games
ofthe season for the home grounds
and they deserve to be \velleate
tended. The ﬁrst game trill be
with Knox next Saturday, and if
we are desirous or winning, our
team should meet with hearty sup
port trorn the grandstand. A life
less. dispiiited crowd of followers
is sure to make 2t disheartened
teat-n.

THE ADVANCE sale of seats for
the Minstrel show has been Linus»
ually large and the prospect is that

there will be a crowded house.
The pertorrners have been hard at
work for the weeks past and the
chorus and orchestral p' ts have
overcome the intricacies of their
selections, the specialists
have developed novel and unheard
of evolutionswitli which to delight
the audience. It is‘to be remem-
tiered that although the brunt of
the work on this entertainment
has been done by town people, yet
they receive nothing tor their line
her. but freely give their servrce
tor the beneﬁt of the treasury or
the Athletic Union. This fact,
together \ ith the novelty and ate
tractiveness of the show. leaves no
excuse for vacant seats.
