Men's BB captures home game

by Rob Brooks

Al the end at January. two droughts
ended. First, Iowa received its ﬁrst mar
ior snow 01 the year, much to the
delight oi the tarmers. But most impure
tantly, the Grlnnell men's basketball
team broke it 20-game home losing
streak by defeating Knox College 67-64
In two overtimes,

The win raises the Pioneers' record to
2712 overall and 177 in the Midwest Con-
Ierence The previous Win was a 6059
decision over Rosary College at the
University oi Chicago Tournament in
late December.

The game started out in typical Grins
nell style, that is the game was close
until about seven minutes left in the
half when Knox built up a 32-22 lead.
But instead of being blown out of Darby
by halltime the Pioneers did a strange
thing. They lought back to take the lead
at 3635.

What makes this Comeback more
amazing is that it was accomplished
without the services of Brian Samara
and Pat Walsh, who were on the bench
with three touls each, Freshman Mike
Neeley came oil the bench to lend re»
bounding strength in the absence or
Samore and Walsh.

The second halt began as the previous
one ended. as the Pioneers zoomed to a
49-38 lead. Grllmell was sparked by the
shooting oi Curt Pabst, who led the
Pioneers in both scoring t 19 pointsi and
rebounding tninei.

With [our minutes remaining in the
game Grinnell held a was lead.
However, .i Knox tullrcourt press upset
the Pioneers and as time ran out it was
knotted at 60760.

Knox had held the ball the last 1 ‘
the game stalling tor the last shot. hey
didn't get a shot 0ft due to the detense oi
Ralph Staples. who stole the ball with
three seconds left and launched at 35
loot shot that bounced of! the rim as the
horn sounded. although nobody heard it
due to the noise generated by the big-
gest crowd at a Grinnell basketball
game this season

The first overtime belied to a chess
match between the Knox coach Harley
Knosher and the Pioneers John
tWoodenl Harvey.

Knosher elected to hold the ball for
the final shot again. surprising most
people, including Harvey. "I was a bit
surprised that they stalled because they
had the momentum and they checked it
themselves. '

Once again, the Siwashers didn't get
a shot oft as they started to look for a
shot with only live seconds left in the l"'
itl‘dl overtime Pabst had the only Grins
nell basket as it was [led at 62-62.’

All this action took place while Walsh
was on the bench. He fouled out with

two minutes left in regulation time. In
tact, Knox's 60th point came oti a
technical foul shut assessed to Walsh
when he disagreed with the referee's
call against him.

The tinal overtime was more open as
Grinnell drew first blood and took a
64-62 lead on a Staples lay~up. Knox
was then torced to move the ball and
after they tied it up they stalled again
after a Grinnell miss.

However. Staples again came up with
the big play on deiense. stealing the ball
and getting fouled on the process.

With 29 seconds leit. Staples again hit

squads around. in recent years.
however. the team's standing has slips
ped, But first year coaches Will and
Evelyn Freeman are hoping tor a
return to the excellence at years past.

This year's group certainly appears
to have all the necessary ingredients,
especially the men‘s team. Men's coach
Will Freeman feels that his team has
both talent and depth. He Said, "Last
week we held our first time trial of the
season and in say we were highly suc-
cesstul.” The team is composed of both
proven seniors and talented
underclassmen who have an apparent.
ly responded well to the training pro-
gram Freeman has installed.

Senior Deslmond Bannister has long
been an outstanding perioriner in the
short sprints. Sophomores Mike Mc~
Crary and Jell Hersh are set to help
Bannister in these events, although Mc-
Crary is still recovering train a we
season ankle injury.

The team is led in the longer
distances by Kevm Kay and Charlie
Briggs. Bari-y Litt has improved his
personal record by a full toot in the pole
vault.

Jon Maren and Stuart McKee make
up another pair or talented
underclassmen and both perform in the
high hurdles and Jumping events.

Perhaps the heart oi the team lies in
the shotpui event because seniors Pete
Blonsky and Mike Kearney are two or
the best shotputters in the conterence.
It’s rare [or a school like Grinnell [0
have one premium shotputter and to
have two oi them is very unusual.

()n the women's team, the level at
talent is Just as high but a lack oi depth
could present a problem. Women’s
coach Evelyn Freeman said, "We‘ve
