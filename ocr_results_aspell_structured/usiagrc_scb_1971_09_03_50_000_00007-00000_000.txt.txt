Development-Office
, Hus Good Year

by Charles Martin

Although Dean Walker ter-
med the College’s financial
situation as "serious but not
critical" in his annual finan-
cial report to the faculty a
week ago, Grinnell College
did manage to keep its ope~
rating fund in the black for
the last fascal year. Much of
the credit for such a sues
cessful year belongs to the
Office of Development, headed
by Mr. James Avison and
staffed by three other meme
bers.

The Office of Development
raises funds for all facets
of the College’s spendingpro-
gram. Last year the office
collected $1,957,039, which
was $326,937 more than the
total for the previous year.
This was roughly one-third
of the total 6*milli0n dollar
budget. (Note: The student
comprehensive fee today ac-
counts for approximately 62%
of the total cost of the ope-
rating and plant budget.)
These funds come from a
variety of sources, including
foundations, corporations,pa-
rents, and the Alumni Fund.
The office works with the
Alumni office to secure gifts
for the year and to organize
annual giving.

Avison cited the increase
in gifts and the successful
trimming ofthe operatingbud-
get as the main reason a
positive balance was found in
the operating fund at the end
of the year. Last year the
College experiencednoamder
mic or political problems that
might have caused it to lose
its good standingwithparents,
alumni, and other supporters.
Even with the increase in
gifts, the Office of Develop-
ment continues to be under
considerable pressuye. in
1966, only five'years ago, the
College needed just $250,000
in unrestricted gifts tobalance
its operating budget; last
year's need was for almost
one million dollars. v

Much of this increase has
been due to inﬂation and to
the fact that the 11 million
dollar endowment does not
produce a large income. This
year‘s need has been reduced
to $600,000 for unrestricted
gifts through economy cutsand
the stable collegeatmosphere.
Due to the lack of resources
the forseeable future, the

> , Almuni fund will need to be

kept up in order for Grinnell
to succeed, reports Mr.
Avison.

. Fﬁncesco Trio
Opens Third Year

The Francesco Trio began
its third year in residence
at Grinnell with an informal
performance last Sunday eve-
ning in the South Lounge.

The group, composed of Da-
vid Abel (violin), Bonnie Ham~
pton (cello), and Nathan Sch-
wartz (piano), gives concerts
on Saturday evenings through
out the year and rarely re~
peats a composition.

The musicianshave beenplar
ying together professionally
since 1964 and have been ace
quainted for many years. Ab-
el and Hampton grew up in
San Francisco and met twen-
ty-three years ago at a sum-
mer chamber music course
at the conservatory in San
Francisco. Nathan did his
graduate work at Berkeley.
Whilte there, he played duets
with both Ms. Hampton and
Mr. Abel-~before the triowas
formed.

Bonnie andNathanwere mar-
ried last summer but for pro
fessional reasons Bonnie
Hampton will continue to use
her maiden name.

PARKING from

All lots and tow away zones
will be marked. Parkingregur
lations will be in effect from
8:00 to 5:00 Monday through
Friday and 8:00 to 12:00 p.m.
on Saturday.

The regulations werewritten
by the Social Policies Com‘
mittee at its last meeting
last year and have been ap-
proved by President Leggett.
The reason (or the new regu-
lations: some sort of organi-
zation is needed for the in~
creased number of cars on
campus now that sophomores
and junior, in addition to se-
niors, are allowed to have
cars.

Dean Kimbo says, “We don't
anticipate any problems. “Tl'
cketing is to he done by stu—
dents patrolling lots. All fines
go to the SGA budget towards
paying the students Min pats
re] the lots. All fines must
be paid before registration
for the following semester or

the mailing of transcripts.

standing army which is repu-
ted to be under the command
of Commissar Clampett.
Questions on this subject, as
well as on the diplomatic sta*
tus of the house were ans-
wered eitherin Russian (which
this reporter does net under
stand) or else simply with,
”No comment."

They did confirm, however,
rumors that the House has
been conducting experiments
designed to prove the super
riority of Slavic rats as op-
posed to Amerimn rats. Both
breeds have been given in'
jECtiOnS of amphetemine, and
the Slavic rats are said to
adapt better to the drug. The
immediate signifigance oruti‘
liZation of these experiments
is not evident at this time.

Francesco Concert

The Francesco Trio will open Grinnell's program of musical
events tomorrow night with a concert at 8 p.m. in Roberts
Theatre.

The trio will play three selectionsr-Vivaldi’s Sonata in C
Minor; Strawinsky's Duo Concertant for Violin and Piano;
and Schubert’s Trio in vilat Major, Q). 99.

Deferments l

All male students who are registered for the draft are
urged to apply immediately for their II-S student defer-
ments. According to an interpremtion of the Midwest Center
for Draft Counseling (MCDC) in Chicago, all upperclassmen
should be able to keep their student deferments until gran
duation. Freshmen most likely will lose their deferments
when the new draft bill becomes law, but should apply anyway
in case a change is made before final passage. >
The Office of Student Affairs has the forms for the defer-
ment application. and all concerned students should con—
tact that office for further information.

Flu Shots

The Health Center reported that 654 students were given
flu shots at the end of registration Monday. One would wonder
where the other six hundred students went.
