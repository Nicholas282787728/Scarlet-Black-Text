One 0[ last year's spring break trips
was a skiing trip to Steamboat Springs,
Colo. Then. Brian Gratch had organized
the trip and this year he and GORP
have come up with another spring
break ski trip. For 12 days a GORP van
full of people will Venture off to Jackson
Hole, Wyn, Because the GORP van will
be the mode of transporation, the total-
cost of the trip will be 3347. “Last year’s
trip was terrific," Gratch said. “And
the trip this year should be live times
better." .

GORP is tlexible enough to try any
new activity or simply continue
established “iavorite” trips. The only
thing that does not change is the need
for skilled leaders and the participation-
nl anyone interested in GORP ac-.
tivities. New students who already have
speciﬁc skills are encouraged to par
ticipate in GORP and lead trips,
Students who have never participated
in nonp or who have never pars
ticipated in outdoor activities are
welcome to try someﬂ’ling new. it
doesn’t take much tn get involved.
GORP is NOT a closed group and one
need not be an "expert" to go on a
GORP trip.

The entire campus community is en
com-aged to attend meetings and to par-
ticipate in workshops. trips, and plan-
ning session. Came to a meeting and
tind out about the types at equipment
and trips that make up GORP. GORP is
interested in any ideas, suggestions. or
comments concerning any area of its
functioning. GORP meets every Sun-
day night in FDR E of the Forum at 7
p.m. Attend the weekly GORP meeting
and GET INVOLVED.
