Sternfeld, Neeley

Hold Exhibition

of Watercolors in Magoun Hall

Summer Spent in Studying
Under O’Hara
in Maine

By LICE SOBOLIK

A striking watercolor cxliihit of
40 paintings now shown in the
art studios, third ﬂoor Magoun
hall, illustrates the summer work
of Miss Edith a, sternfeld, direc—
[or or art, and Robert Nccley, e
'37, and now a strident at the Min»
nenpolis school of art.

During July and August Miss
Sternrrld and Mr, Ncclcy studied

at L c Eliot O'Hara school or wo-l

tel-color painting at Geode Rocks
Beach, Me. Mr. O’Hara, the in—
structor, may he renicniheied in
connection with the colorful di
play of paintings which hung in
the corridor of Main hail last
spring.
Show Vivid Colors

The paintings exhibited reveal
Mr. O'Hara's technique and recidy
flow of vivid color which his pu-
pils soon learn, The' pictures also
symbolize originality of interpre
tation and workmanship.

The subject matter ranges
from quiet church landscapes to
swirling abstract compositions,
Most fascinating are the reproduc—
tions of boatsia freighter paint-
ed with the brilliant color anti dis»
tinct shadows of a setting sun; or
craft with a glorious red sail, and
a tug boat.

\Vhite Compositions Interesting

The pictures containing a great
deal of white in their compositions
are interesting, while the opposite
effects are produced by those
paintings which use only dark, suh~
dued colors

a ten minute sketch of “Billy's
Bus" is amusing, while another
picture, ”Wash Day," gives dis»
tinction to its commonplace sub
ject matter.

An individual panning by Mr.
Neeiey, which has attracted mncli
attention, portrays a pasty orange
herd shrouded in deep purple and
cerise draperies, "An Abstraction
on Death."

Mus al Theme Show"
subtle colors and rhythm char»
acterize Miss sternreld's interpre-
tation of a musical theme, and
imagination distinguishes the two
compositions, “Plumber's Dream"
and “Adam and Eve," the latter-
portraying a grotesque monster

with a ravenous pink tongue.

l Abstract arrangements ot still
life forms, various interpretations
of rocks, scenes on the heacli,
farm, at the village and the circus
comprise the remainder of the dis-
play.

For the benefit of students who
have railed to visit the exhibit.
‘Mlss Stci-nteld has consented to let
iit remain throughout next week.
‘lt may be seen in the art studios,
third floor Magoun hall, any day,
preferably during the morning
hours,
