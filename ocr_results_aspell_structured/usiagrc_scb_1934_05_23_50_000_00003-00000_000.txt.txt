Another romance that has bloom-
ed and ﬂourished in the spring at-
mosphere is that of Recsal- and
Long. Ellen you remember as the
girl who threatened to take some of
the dormitory stew and end it all
it she was presented with the doves
at the Bron-n Derby. However,
that’s as may be, for the happy cou-
ple can be seen almost any day
ﬂoating around the campus like
sour cream on a tapioca pudding
(Griniiell Euler)

Most constant couple on the Grill—
nell campus, year in mid year out.
has seemed to he hIcCuily and
sti-uble. in fact they seem to he
cemented together almost as close-
ly as the dormitory hash, although

neither one is petrified as yet.

The rumor continues to percolate
hat there was a masquerade party

Wen, that's all about the iood.
Something had to be said by some-
one. The man is yet to he found
who could masticate that Wednes-
day noon lunch, although we must
admit that some at the material
above has been exaggerated, if only
slightly.
