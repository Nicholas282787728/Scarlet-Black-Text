SGA is again off and running
with the recentsenatorial elections
last Monday and the first Joint
Board meeting Wednesday. Lia
Kohles, administrative coordina-
or, got the elections done early
this semesteer deserves thanks,
Now that SGA issetup. what is on
the horizon to discuss
and work for this se~
mester?

As you know, the
Harris Center is scheduled for con-
struction starting this summer, so
the SGA Cabinet is working hard
to outline how the building will be
run before then. Rob Killian will
be leading the student voice in the
curricular review which has been
under way for some time and is
predicted to set some policy this
semester. Cindy Jones arid our
new assistant student coordinator,
John Master, will be running the
' Spring Waltz and the blood drive.
Matt Rickettcontinues to work on
lheSafety Committee. DaveStein-
man has already pulled in some
big'narnes for Peace Day and con
tinucs to work on concerts and
films. Once again, exam-week
films will be selected by campus
survey.

Several open forums have al-
ready been scheduled this semesr
ter. Topics for the open forums
will include minority recruiting,
women’s and gender studies, the
SGA presidential and vice-presir

ageworldcitizen,the
impacteach of us can have is very
significant.

Eighttimes! Well, that’s pretty
overconsumptivc. Let's look at
something more optimistic. Each
individualin theUnitedStales pro-
duces an average of 1930 pounds
ofgarbageevery year. That’s first
place. Australia holds a close sec-
ond at 1500, and Europe is even
more conservative in trash mash,
ranging from about 500 to 900
poundspercapitaannually. Nigee
ria comes in at a lowly 385, about
one—fifth the U.S. value. Not as
bad as the aluminum.

Is recycling just metals? No
way! One year of newspapers
weighs about 220 pounds, and re-
cycling it saves about one-quarter

dential/PAA debates, and discus-
sions on initiatives. Besides these
topics, SGA is waiting to bring
other issues to the student forum
as they arise.

As president among an excel-
lent Cabinet, a relatively efficient
Joint Board, and established com»

mittee system, I plan to
let the paper-shuffling
rest for a while and go
aftersomebiggerissues
this semester. First on the list is
getting anadrninisu-ativecommit-
merit towards theinstallationof an
international phone system. After
over a semester of promises, it is
time for some action in this area.
Also last semester, several hous-
ing improvement ideas were
brought up by students that now

need to be followed up. Towel'

racks in the bathrooms, computers
in the OCCO houses, microwaves,
and those infamous condom ma-
chines were promised, and I plan
to see their installation.

Third, President Drake's Task
Force, formed to plan future ex~
penditures and direction for the
college, has had some productive
meetings since its formation. I
feel the future productivity of this
committee now depends on Its
ability to form concrete goals and
timelines. I also feel that after a
semester of discussren, students
can begintobeinformed aboutthc
concerns oftheirinstilution‘s fac-

of the energy used to make new
stuff, and cuts down on deforcswv
tion. Even glass and plaSUCS can be
recycled, if you sort them and find
the right places.

But the best solution to the prob-
lem? Ask the question: Do I need
this packagcjpaper/etcﬂ The Over-
packaging Test involves counting
up the layers of packaging on zl
product,thencomparingthattohow
much is really necessary. Twolayers
is probably too much; one layer
meansit‘sprobably plenty sanitary.
Buying in bulk also cuts down on
containers, as does usmg returnable
containers instead of disposable
ones.

Composting can also cut down
on garbage, because about half of
our household garbage is organic
(peels, leaves, leftovers. etc.). Plus
we can then use it to fertilize lawns
and gardens, more cheaply and
safely than commercial fertilizers.

ulty and administration. My job
this semester will be to start that
link of communication.

Finally, I want to tackle the
idea of student involvement be
yond the classroom more aggres-
sively. In some eyes, almost'too
muchisofferedtousasstudentsin
the forrn of extracurricular lec—
tures, symposia, and organiza»
tional activities We seem forced
to passively soak up what we can
as we face the demands of acade-
mia because inspiration and op
portunity todo more witha lecture
topic are not readily apparent.
Frankly, I'm tired of being ex-
pected to play the sponge. I feel
strongly that if students were bet-
ter-educated on ways to become
involved personally and the habit
of leaving a lecture without the
immediate opportunity to act on
personal droughts and ideas was
broken, students could benefit so
much more from the highly di-
verse but rather moldy lecture se-
ries of Grinnell. In science, they
tell us you don't fully understand
until you experiment with con»
cepts lectured on in class. in m,
tional concerns and community
trends the rule is the same. Give
the student a literal grasp on a
cause or movement, and he/she
will unquestionably have a better
intellectual grasp of it. My goal is
