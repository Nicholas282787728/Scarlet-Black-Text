Being a woman, Susan Stamberg
feels, has aided her in the field oi radio
Journalism. Stamberg, corhost or "All
Things Considered," a nightly news

. program on National Public Radio, said
she brings a "dllferent sensibility ‘ to
the job. . .

'. Because she is a woman. Stamberg

' thinks she has different motivations
and asks dil'i'erent questions than most
men might. Stamberg gives c'onsideraA
tion to the feelings of the person she is
interviewing as well as to getting the

: lacLs, As an example, Stamberg wrote
an editorial alter the hostages were
released saying that the press should
leave them alone. She explained that it
was not necessary to investigdte every
aspect 01' their lives; it was enough to
know the hostages were out oi Iran,

’ This approach, stamberg said. is more

sionate,‘ These diiferences are Whal '

makes Stamberg’s style unique and she
thinks she gets a better story in the long
.run because other approach. Stamberg
said that she i'elt it is important to be
rounded in one's work as well as in
one‘s life,
' While she thinks her approach to
reporting and intervtewing is dit‘ierent
_. from that of the men on the stall at ”All
Things Considered," Stamberg pointed
out that not all oi the women stall
members share her opinions. Although
Siamberg thinks she holds certain opi-
' nions and has a specilic style because
she is a women, one cannot say that all
women journalists are that way.
'. A problem ior women in yournalistic
ﬁelds, said Stamberg, is that it is oi'ten

shy male sources and coworkers.
«.Women are still lighting sexism and
have had to work harder, be more elli-
cient and more experienced to be taken
as seriously as men doing the same Job.
As Stamberg put it, many \\ omen hurt it
I necessary to act "mainly" to overcome
" these difficulties when doing an inter-
view or reporting. She indicated that in-
.- stead oi relaxing and relying on instinct
, or pure interest. women often are very
reserved und still Women are making

The practice at carhostlng radio and
'.lelevision programs with both a man
and a woman has become popular and
Stamherg said that women ”give an un-
ded texture to the programs. '

 

According to Stanilierg, women till
many positions oi importance at liar
tional Public Radio and she ieels this
has helped to give -a kind oi respec-
tability to women so that they are
taken more seriously, Nevertheless.
she thinks. it has not the purpose oi
NPR to speciﬁcally H” the pDSilions
with women. There have been more
women program managers because the
salaries ior that iob were so ion that
men could not allord to hold the position
very long, The women managers,
though, iiere usually married and lhe
