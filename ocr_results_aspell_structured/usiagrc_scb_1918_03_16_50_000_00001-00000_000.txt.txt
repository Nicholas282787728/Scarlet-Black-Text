The contest with the state Univer»

game" oi the schedule and will une
doubtedly hold the interest of lootball
tollowers thruout the state, as it did

,last year, when the scarlet team won
10 to 0.

Next in importance to the lowa game
will probably he the contest with
Drake. The game which gives promise
oi being the most important home
game ot the schedule is that with Cor—
nell, the last battle of the season, Cor-
nell has not won irom the scarlet and

account oi the early date on which it is
played, nevertheless the school irom
the Key City has been especially
strong in the past new years, and with
such men as the lamous negro athlete,
Sol Butler, among the told, their
strength must not be judged lightly.

Captain Osgood to term a nucleus tor

Fourth Food Conservation Lecture
Deals With Need oi the
'Allies for Wheat

The great importance of conservmg
our wheat supply for the use ot our
Allies was discussed by Prot. H. s.
Conard in the tourth tood lecture at
chapel yesterday morning.

Speaking at the Allies’ whcat shoi
age, he said, “The Allies need 576 mi
lion bushels of wheat to put them on
their normal basis. They can extst on
220 million bushels. This supply must
come trom North America. The Allies
are not asking that they shall live nor—
mally. They are only asking enough
to keep them alive. They must have
220 million bushels oi wheat. Our
surplus is only 88 million busliel's.
We must, theretore, save. This saving
of 132 lnilhon bushels means the sav~
ing 01 one pound per person per week."

Get .llong without whom

Professor Collard sliou-ctl that get-
ting along without wheat was in real-
ity no hardship at all. We do not need
wheat to keep us in physical condition.
All cereals contain about the same pron
portion of protein, rats and cal'bohydr
rates and are wellebalanced toods.

Seven hundred million people never
used wheat bread. With the adequate
supply oi other foods at our disposal,
there should he no trouble in replacing
wheat. Besides, the cost of the pros
poscd substitutes is not an obstacle.

Work of Pool] ldi nitration

He spoke oi the eacellent work done
by the food admin‘ traticn in the price-
ﬁxing ct commoditr to prevent spec-
lilatlmi, the tormation oi the wheat
combination, the licensing ot millers
and wholesalers, the regulation of the
milling o[ wheat, the instituting ol
wheatlcss days and meals, the regula;
tion of the selling of wheat to Colin
sumcrs, and the adoption ot laws pre
venting boarding.

in conclusion, Protessor Canard said,
"The time has come when we can no
longer say, 'We will eat what we like.‘
We have no longer any excuse for fol-
lowing a more \vlilm. Unless we share
some of the suitor-lugs and hardslnps
of the war. the war for you and me is
lost." ,

The last lecture will be given by
Prof. H. w. Norris Tuesday morning
because of the examinations Thursday
and Friday.

CEDAR RAPIDS, .larch iii—The
Grinnell afﬁrmative debating team lost
to Coe her-e last night, 2 to 1, in a
closely fought argument on the dues-
tron, “Resolved: That the tederal gov-
ernment should adopt a permanent
policy or price control.”

The Grinnell lineup was slightly
changed trom that ot last week. Frid-
lund taking the place of Haworth, who
was dropped because oi the pressure
or scholastic work. Fridlund, altho
handicapped by short preparation, was
back in his old farm, and was undoubt-
edly the star or the affirmative team,
altho Ladd and Rattety did creditable
work, Armstrong was the strongest
speaker at the Coe trio.

. Fritlluiitl Opens Debate

Fi'ldlund opened the debate by show.
ing that tcder-al price control is needed
to regulate monopoly prices, but Jacks
son, the ﬁrst negative speaker, argued
that t e policy had tailed in practice.
According to coe's usual custom. he
placed three typewritten questions on
the table oi the Grinnell team. Raf-
icty, in opening the next. speech, point—
ed out that these uucstions had been
answered in the ﬁrst afﬁrmative
speech. He turther showed that price
control is right in principle.

Weber, the second Coe man, con—
tended that the policy was not practi-
cal hecause a tair price could not be
determined. Ladd closed the con-
structive argument tor the affirmative
by showing the practicability of the
system. Armstrong, .35 the last nega-
tive speaker, said that the policy: was
wrong in principle.

Grinnell Is Strong in ill-buttul

Grinnell canto back stiong Ill rebut-
tal with a changed lineup of rneu,
F‘ridllliitl taking the position of ﬁnal
speaker. Ladd gave an excellent re-
buttal, destroying many or the nega-
tive contentions, Raitety also made a
creditable rebuttal speech. Fl'idlilnll
did good work in tearing the negative
case to pieces, speech by speech. Wche
or did the best rebuttal work for Coo,
while Armsrong summarized their
citsc. '

The judges of the contest were Prue
fessors \Vassam, Wilcox and W ntuey,
ot the state university. The crowd of
about 300 evinced considerable interest
in the question. ,The Goo team and
coach entertained the Grinnell team at
an intormal spread aitcr the debate.
The men returned home this morning.
