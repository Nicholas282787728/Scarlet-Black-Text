ediled by Diana Spradlin

In Tawni O'Dell's bestseller Balk Randi, Hurley
Altmyer recalls the back of his father’s hand, the com-
forting touch of an older woman, the hidden horrors
of incestuous relationships, visits to his imprisoned
mother and panic attacks.

A greatly disturbing, yet strangely captivating
page-nirner, the novel probes thedarkcst depths of
the soul and mind through its protagonist Hurley
Altmycr, a teenage boy forced to mature too quickly.

A dysfunctional family, a skewed perception of
normalcy and a traumatic childhood has letr l—larley
in a state of devastation. After his mother is sent to
jail for shooting his abusive father, Harley becomes
the legal guardian of his three sisters and the sole pro-
prietor of his downtrodden home. His life is a blur
of hushed whispers, darting glances, IOWApaying jobs

Any book that claims to solve all
your dating problems should he taken
with a grain of salt. And perhaps this
was the authors’ intent. Their trendy,
flippant prose seems to take itself seri-
ously enough to make such claims, but
not enough to be entirely credible. For
example, a sentence that begins with
the phrase “sexual harassment rules and
