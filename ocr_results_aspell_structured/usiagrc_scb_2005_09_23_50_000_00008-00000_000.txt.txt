Last year I was one of those insanely awe-
some first-years who actually went to the
medallion ceremony while mnny ofmy newly
acquired friends got drunk. So to fill in those
individuals who deemed themselves too cool
for N80 week, the defining moment of the
ceremony was nor being presented with a
shiny hunk of medulrshaped silver, but be
ing informed that 60 percent of Grmnelllans
marry another Grinnellian.

We were then
instructed to take
a good look around
the loom because we
just might be sitting
ncxt to our future
life partner. At this
moment I recall
jokingly scootch-
mg a bit closer to the ridiculously attractive
firstryear to my right. He was not amused.

Despite the overly romantic tone of the
ceremony, I found the possibility of my life
partner living somewhere nearby terribly cits
citing. As such, I was excited to meet new
people and greatly anticipated my introduc-
tion to the granddaddy matchmaker of them
all: Harris.

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was soon
to be dashedThe medallion ceremony’s sugr
gestion that Grinnell had a strong aptitude
for lifesparvnership had evoked images of
romance and grandeur

I, over—ideallstically I 11 [l] am an old- fashioned believer/h
a re/ationsh/p began/n9 int/maty,
and not the other way around.

admit, envisioned some
sort of paradise where a
countless array of avails
able suitors wandered
around dressed in laurel leaves, engaging of-
ten in playful romps, handsholding, cuddling,
and the recitation of the love poetry of Pablo
Neruda.

But Harris provided no such image ofpar-
adisc. Instead, I was engulfed in a sexual scn
of a drunken orgyfying magnitude. Because
I am less than enthused by hiprhop and find
random people rubbing their Crotches all over
my rear end as appealing as a gallon sized yar
of hippopotamus saliva, ihe only redeeming
quality ofthe entire evening was the cathartic
experience that is Madonna’s Like a Prayer.

But the real problem I have with Harris
isn’t Harris, it's what often happens ‘rlffel'T
wards: the random hookup (which will here—
after be abbreviated as TRH). TRH makes
me cringe because I am an oldrfashioncd
believer in a relationship begettmg intimacy,
ind not the other wny around.

And while I ncirhcrbcrnre not judge those
who are comfortable with a Saturday night
rendezvous, drunken or otherwise,l feel the
need to share anothei avenue, a detoul ifyou
will, to Relationship Lane.

Q. Haw dour NM racial/y awkward inrli'mdir

grinding lemme alga/timed with 11 foiiiidcmlt,

A: They talk to each other.

Really, that’s all there is to it. In fact, a re-
cent srudy shows that 99.53 percent ofall life
partners everywhere engaged in some form of
oral, written or manual communication be-
fore they fell in love. Another astounding 97

crccnt communicated throughout the courts
ing process.

And still am
otliel 95 percent
of established life
partners commus
nicate with one
another on a daily

Sindeworld

basis.

Approaching someone you really like and
striking up a conversation can beslightly (err
rifying, and Harris does make it much easier.
Just grab a few beers, find a couple or unoc-
cupied bottoms, and go with the flow.

But while I know of many a relationship
that began after a night at Harris, I also know
of quite a few that began with a shy glance, an
awkward exchange, and even a simple “I'm so
stressed out right now."

Although both TRl-l and forging a friend—
ship can lead to a meaningful relationship, I
prefer the latter. I like to think of it as the
scenic route. Why take the interstate directly
to the circus when you
can take a more charming
route with trees, ﬂuttering
butterﬂies in your stoma
ach, sunshine, a quickened
pulse, rainbows, giddiness,
ﬂowers and smiles so enormous that they
cause your neck veins to bulge?

I suppose after the circus one could opt to
drive home along the scenic route, but having
just come from the circus, it probably won’t
feel quite as exciting.

Besides, taking a detour means you'll never
have to experience an uncomfortable morning
after, try desperately to remember the name
of the individual lying in bed besides you, or
worry about differing expectations of where
your relationship with your new acquaintance
is headed (or isn‘t).

But Erin, the person reading this news-
paper might say, Aren’t you single? Who are
you to give me dating advice? And if this is
indeed the question being asked of me, i will
respond as such: Yes, 1 nm single.

And yes, I am no closer to Life Partners
dom orjolnmg the 60 percent club than I was
a year ago. But I still don't feel the allure of
TRH. So to said individual who questioned
my authority, all 1 can really offer in my dc»
fense is an invitlitio : if you’re looking for
some nice conversation over a big cookie, dial
3495, and we’ll see what develops. I’ll bring
my medallion.

Thank you for making me feel unwelcome... once
again.

Thank you for not being the
Grinnellian(s) you claim you are.
Thank you for promoting stereotypes.
Thank you for disrespecting my I-lispnuic heritage.
AND finally, thankyou for being inconsiderate ofmy
ulltural identitv.

“progressive"

This is directed to whoever tagged the Hispanic
Heritage Month poster of Yolanda Lopez, one of the
most renowned Chicane artists of this time who may
visit Grinnell this academic school year. I don't think
it’s funny that you degraded the image of the Virgen
de Guadalupe, a Mexican and Mexican American
cultural identity icon, with a highly commercialized
reggaeton music artist. You disrespectcd my past emy
people, my struggles, and my cultural pride. lour ac
tions reﬂect your close- mindedness and ignorance.
Gracias.

Bad time for homesickness

This is probably the worst time ever to he homesick
forTexas. Katrina was just a prelude to Rita,which might
hit anywhere along the western gulf coast — New Or-
leans (AGAIN) and Houston (I Ionic smtiggy home)
included. Right now, a bunch ofm) family and friends
ale getting ready to high- -t~ail it for Dallas or Austin, as
are a few thousiutd evacuees from New Orleans.

A friend of mine said that someone living there
must have really pissed off Poseidon, so now some sc~
nous Olympian birch-slap wrath is being unleashed.
It'd be hilarious i.fnot for the body count already. Back
home, I went to school in a neighborhood where the
meets were submerged during regular storms, its no
different from the people dotting facedown In NOLA.
If this shit isn't evidence for global climate changc,l
don't know what the hell would be! Aw" “dang

Last Tuesd' in article appeared in the NYT
in the some spmt as Lisa Bclkiu‘s "The opr- Out
Generation piece a few years ago This one, in news
rather than the magaz e, argued that women at
elite colleges such as . and l’lalvard are lnCIClXS',
ingly planning on choosing families over careers
once they act into their late 20s.

Certainly families are incredibly important 1
wholeheartedly agree. My quesdon, however, is
where are the men? Raising a family is not just the
mothers responsibility, it’s the duty of both par-
ents In a male female family, the assumption that
it should be the male who continues to work while
the female focuses on kids is offensive.
