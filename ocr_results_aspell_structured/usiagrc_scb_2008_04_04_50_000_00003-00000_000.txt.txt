damage? And ifit's some posters that are just thrown away, what’s the monetary damage?”

Under towaTitle XVI section 716.1, Criminal Mischief rs defined as “Any damage, defacing,
alteration, or destruction oftangrhie property is criminal mischiefwlren done intentionally by one
who has no right to act so."

While questioning whether the acts were criminal, George Rosie said that they were noncthct
less unfortunate. “Obviously it's serious," he said. “It’s not a good thing to offend people."

George Rosic also said that his son was in no way connected to a Feb 29 incident wherein letr
ters with homophobic sluts were mailed to 34 members of the camprls’s queer commurrrty.“l want
you to know that Greg had absolutely no way ofscndrng those letters. He left school on Tuesday
thc 26th,” said George Rosic. “He was not within the statc otiowa hcginning Tuesday afternoon
and he has not been back since. \Ne totally abhor those."

The Grinncll Police Department and Grinncll Collegc Security are still investigating the letters
incident. Grinncll Police Dcpartment could not comment on whether or not there is any connec-
tion between the two acts,

Matherly said the department believed Greg Rosrc to be out ofstatc and that he would have to
return to Iowa to be arrested and tried. Any multirstatc action, such as an extradition is unlikely,
he said,“We don’t set that; the courts do,"said Mathcrly.“l3ur usually there’s not an extradition or
anything with a charge like this,"

Joseph LaVoie ’11, who roomed with Greg Rosic for the first halfor the fall semester this year,
would not comment on Greg Rosic’s connection to the mndalism and said that he has not heard
from him since lre'witlidrcw from the collegc.“l sent him an email but he hasn’t responded yet,"
LaVoire said.

He said that he and Greg Rosic had become good friends and he plans to continue to contact

him. “Greg is a really nice guy,” said LirVoie. “He and I got really close and I'm planning to keep in'

touch with him,”

When most people think of issues ofglobal
warming and its irrrpact on the arctic, they usual
focus on a narrow set of environmental con-
sequences. This week’s “Critical Issues for the
Arctic" Roscnfreld symposirrm seeks to expose
some ofthc numerous other issues involved,

The approximately 75 people in attendance
atTrresday night's lecnrrc expected to hear about
Arctic indigenous peoples. Instead, they were
surpriscd to hear a talk hy jeffrcy Clrrarcnzellr
about the dangers otfornrerly used defense sites,
or “FUDS.” Chiarenzelli's lecture urns humped
rrp after travel dclays preycntcd the originally
scheduled talk on the Arctic’s lnrrit populations.
The talk was part of the past week's Roscnfreld
symposium on Arctic issucst

According to Chialerrzelli, a professor of
geology at St. Lawrence University, these aban-
donetl fac cs create many h. .i ds to both the
environment and human and animal lives, “1’
cludirrgleftover wires, landfrlls,and awatersup
ply contaminated by PCBs and heavy metals.
There are currently around 9,000 FUDS in the
United States, and at the present level otgov-
ernment funding they will take over so years to
restore.

 

Chiareirzellis lecture focused on 9th§aym-
bell and Northeast Cape facilities, which were
both built on Alaska’s St, Lawrence Island dur»
ing the Cold War, After walking the arrdience
through the basics of FUDS (with the use of
an Elmer Fridd cartoon), Cliiarenzelli explained
the challenges he has faced in proving environ-
mental hazards posed by the hrcilitres, descriht
ing his work with crwironmental forcnsics as a
“whodunit with chemicals.”

The presentation revealed the complexity of
an issuwglobal warming and the correspond-
ing melting or the Arctic ice cap—too often
reduced to the extinction of polar hears.While
the constant addressing orissucs such as glob-
al warming at a place like Grinnell seem like
preaching to the choir, this week’s arctic sympot
srunr didn’t preach to the choir—it taught the
choir a few new songs.

“We just want [them] cleaned rip and put
back to natural Condition,"Chiai'enzelli said of
tlic FUDS. His words seemed to summarize
not only the issues relating to FUDS. but also
the major problem ot‘ global climate changk
that humankind needs to learn to clean up its
own mess.
