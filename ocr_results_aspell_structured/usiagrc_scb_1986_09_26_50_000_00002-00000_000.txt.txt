_ Misconceptions and

By Theo Eicher

AntirAmericanism 7 Somehow I get the
feeling that the US mass media love to
dwell on that subject. However, it
sometimes seems only to iuliill the plur-
pose oi emphasizing the “unselfishness” oi
the US That is, one often sees the media
raise the subject when the US feels it has to
play policeman of the world again, in order
to lead a particular country (no matter
how antisAmerlcanlstic its attitude) with
military pressure, threat or actions, to the
American “freedom and equality"

Maybe it would help if the American
public and their politicians would realize
that other nations are sovereign nations,
too. And above all. that not all peoples on
this planet go for the AmericansWay-
Freedom-Liberty. wow, now you think i
am a leftist or that I hate the US. Neither is
correct. Maybe you still want to read on
since this was only the introduction to my
critique of the article in the Des Moines
Register, “Schmidt's Parting Shot Hits
Reagan.”

Beiore i can say anything else, i will pro-
vide you with some background iniormas
tion about Helmul Schmidt, If he is not the
most popular, he is the most respected
politician in my country. Not only was he
chancellor for 8 years, a member of
Parliament from 1953 to the present, but
he has also written a variety oi important
books on current political issues His long
career and his achievements in German
and world politics have brought him the
respect oi nearly all German voters over
the years.

I truly lack the competence to outline all
the achievements of Mr. Schmidt’s career
but i concur in the judgment that Ger~
many‘s recognition in the world has reach-
ed an all-time high under Schmldt’s
leadership. Aiter a: years he has decided
not to seek reelection and will “retire" and
become editor in chief of Germany’s
highly-regarded weekly “DIE ZEIT".

Uniortunately i have doubts (together
with ALL other Germans I talked to on this
campus) that there would have been an
article about Helmut Schmidt’s farewell
speech in a US newspaper (except the New
York Times) ii the speech had not contain-

West Germany and Anti-Americanism?

Septrzii 1986

An American’s View

By Kristina Scott

AntiAmericanism rampant in West
Germany? No, it’s not that bad yet. But
one day it could be. By far the majority oi
young Germans i talked with while in
Bonn last year are critical of the United
States.

To a large extent attitudes regarding
Americans run along generational lines.
Older Germans remember American
economic assistance in the form of the
Marshall Plan and American resistance
against Soviet claims to what is now West
Germany. Younger Germans, however,
are not apt to interpret actions undertaken
by the United States iorty years ago as
evidence of current mutual interests bet-
ween the two countries,

One source ot irritation to many young
Germans is the selfrrighteousness oi our
ioreign policy. They read in the iront page
of their newspapers how the United States
designates itself “the home of the tree”
Whereas the Soviet Union is the “evil ems
pire.”

In the pages that iollow, my German
peers perceive little diiierencc as they
compare our ioreign policy to that oi the
Soviets. President Reagan's reiusal to
adopt a moratorium on nuclear test bans
or his plan to disregard the unratified
SALT II treaty lead many Germans to

ed two attacks against President Reagan,

The article depicts Schmidt's address as
a “biting, doublerbai'reled attack” on
American policies. thus conveying the im»
pression to the reader that all Schmidt had
to do in a tweahour iarewell speech was to
bitch at the US.

ALL WRONGU I may assure you that
his main intention was to deliver ‘only’ a
general, German "state oi the union ad
dress." in a speech of more than 120
minutes he leveled only two accusations al
the us: A) unjustly pressuring Germany
to expand its economy at a time when it
should reduce its own deficit (Schmidt had
been Finance Minister ior several years
beiore he became chancellor); B) that
Strategic Deiense initiative will only
cause a new arms race and jeopardize
European security.

1 will attempt to describe the logic to
these accusations and at the same time try
give you an idea of how and why Germans
may ieel diiierently about things than
many Americans do.

Regarding his lost charge, the un
balanced budget of the United States is a
more widely discussed issue in Europe
than it is in the United States itself, The
fact that the deiicit is only a small propor~
tion of the United States GNP does not
weigh as heavily in Europe as the iact that
SOMEONE will have to REPAY the
$160,000,060,DDO (160 billionl. it is also an
equally sad and astonishing iact that the
United States has managed to change
within THREE (H!) years from the
world’s largest creditor to the world's
largest debtor,

In the early 80’s when the United States
had to start tinancmg die tremendous
deiicit partly with high interest rates,
European leaders were begging and
crawling on their knees that the interest
rates might be lowered from their
artiﬁciallyrhigh levels in the United
States, This drama repeated itself at each
economic summit for several years.

The United States economy is so impor-
tant in determining the state of the world
economy, that when the US refused to res-
pond to these pleas, it depressed the
economies oi Japan and, especially,

doubt that our president is any more
peaceVloving than his Soviet counterpart.

The tendency we have as Americans to
flaunt our national pride often reinforces
the interpretation oi our ioreign policy as
sellrrighteous. Some Germans are still
talking about the “Yeah America
Pageant" put on under the pretext oi open»
ing the Los Angeles Summer Olympics
1984. This past July in an international edi~
tion of Time Magazine, Germans could
read of the laVlsh party Americans threw
in their own honor on “Liberty Weekend.”

Germans equate our
national pride with
self- ngbtioumess

Germans can't be blamed for equating
our national pride with self-righteousness,
ior they are not able to empathize with an
American love of one‘s country. Germans’
national pride is for the most part confined
to pride in their country's economy. The
most obvious reason tor the predominance
oi an “economic" as opposed to a political
patriotism is Germany's World War ii
legacy.

Many young Germans are unhappy with
much oi American ioreign policy. Yet they

recognize that presently their country has
no alternative but to continue to rely on the
American nuclear guarantee ior its securir
ty, This tension 7 being a part oi the
American orbit and along with the United
States having to bear the‘consequences oi
American foreign policy on the one hand,
while not being able to influence that
policy on the other ,— contributes to anti-
Americanism,

American heavyrhandedness in dealing
with its allies is a primary source oi irrita-
tion to Germans oi all ages, Most haven’t
forgotten the Reagan administration’s
reiosal to allow German subsidiaries oi
American companies to sell pipeline
technology to the Soviets. More recently,
remember American impatience when the
European Economic Community didn’t
impose what our government considered
to be appropriate sanctions against Libya?

The German public ieels strongly

'against unconditionally iollowing the

American lead. when as picture oi
Chancellor Helmut Kohl bowing to
neagan on a state visit appeared in major
German newspapers, the German govern
ment had to ward oii accusations oi being
subservient to Washington.

No, I'm not advocating that we as

MisunderStandings

Europe even more than the world reces-
sion had already done. Voices were raised
about the loyalty and the exceptional
selfishness of the United States toward its
allies.

Today the situation is reversed 7 in a
way. Now that the United States has decidr
ed that there should be a recovery, it has
finally lowered the interest rate. The over
valued dollar has plunged sharply, com-
pared to all major currencies, especially
to the Yen and the Deutschmark. Today
the dollar is approximately “percent
lower than one year ago. which means that
American goods on the world market
ought now be 43-percenl cheaper than last
year compared'to German exports

Germany has become a

scapegoat for the failure
of Reaganomics

However. the American trade deiicit is
STILL widening and the United States
economy is not picking up as Reaganomics
has expected Germany and Japan have
become the scapegoats ior the latter
lailure because these countries have not
lowered their interest rates LOW
ENOUGH for American interests in order
to help the US economy to recover.

The iact is, Germany and Japan have
lowered their discount rates several times
this year under severe pressure irom the
United States (just read the news). Both
economies have reached stages where yet
another reduction in the discount rate
would dramatically increase inﬂation.

Fact is. German interest rates are
already the LOWEST in the world. Fur-
thermore, a study of the German Fed
revealed that a one-halt-point lower dis-
count rate will only raise the German
gross domestic product by 1/10 oione per-
cent. which would surely have no
economic effect on the American
economy.

Under these circumstances, I can only
agree with the DEFENSE 7 not the
“biting attack" that Helmut Schmidt put
forward.

Regarding the second charge. a prevail-
ing sentiment among West Germans is
that Strategic Defense Initiative will not
be the savior oi the European people (in
contrast to the American people, as Mr.
Reagan saidl. This is simply because
medium and short~range missiles do not
leave the earth's atmosphere and thus will
not technically and timewise be subject to
destruction via satellite. Anyone who
knows about the force structure of the
superpowers is aware that in the event oia
\var,,medium, short arange or tactical
missiles Will do the most damage in
Europe. Just as an American military oi-
iicer recently observed, “it’ll be tough to
fight a war in West Germany because
cities are only two kilotons apart.”

Therefore I can only quote Mr. Schmidt,
when he stated periectly correctly what
Strategic Defense Initiative will mean for
Europe: “Increased security for the ter
rilorics of the Soviet Union and the US
could only be added at the cost of reduced
security in Europe."

We see again that Schmidt’s address
was no attack but a defense on Why Ger~
mans do not want to participate in the new
arms race I may also indicate that the
way Schmidt touched upon both issues was
only irom the academic, German perspec~
tive. He did not even attempt something
that may then be labeled antlr
Americanism: raising questions about the
morality oi internal as well as external
American policies.

To conclude, I want to leave the Des
Moines Register article and Schmidt's ad
dress to come to the more general theme of
antirAmer'lcanism, or what is so oiten p0r~
trayed as such, but what I would like to
label “misconceptions and misunderstan-
dings".

You might have learned reading my ar-
ticle that there are a few things you knew
litﬂe about. Now things may seem to be in
a different light. I believe that this is the
origin for all the high emotions both sides.
Communication between die United States
and Germany (or any other country) is
rotten. Opinions and ideas are formed by
