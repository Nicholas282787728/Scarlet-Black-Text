Nighthawks ice cold,
lose pair to Loras

by Ian Gustafson

Last weekend the Grinnell
hockey club traveled to Waterloo
to play Loras College of
Dubuque. Going into the series
the Nighthawks had a record of 4-
3. The debacle at Waterloo put
them at an even .500 for the
season.

This semester Grinnell is
witltout star goalie Dave Shane.
Freshman Dave Peterson, who
has never played hockey before,
volunteered to play. Grinncll had
seven players for Saturday night’s
game, meaning that there would
have been just two substitutes for
51 minutes of hockey. Loras, on
the other hand. had 18 players, a
backup goalie, and a coach.
Loras also gets to practice during
the week, and their organized
style of play was a factor in their
dominance of the series.
Grinncll's line-up included Mikc
Jennings, Dennis Gehardstein,
Matt Arnold, Bill l-loeman, and
University of Iowa players Steve
and Tom Margarita.

Despite the dearth of players,
Grinnell was only losing 3 to 1
until the middle of the third
period when Tom Margarita slid
headlong into the boards and
suffered a mild concussion After
that demoralizing loss, the
Nighthawk defense, or I should
say team, fell apart, with Loras
scoring seven goals to win 10 to
1. Mike Jennings scored the lone
goal against the talented Loras
goalic. Dave Peterson stopped
46 of the 55 Loras shots.

The addition of two native
Minnesotans. Geoff Larson and
Keith Wilner, injected Grinncll
with a boost of confidence for
Sunday‘s rematch The pace was
fast in the first period as Grinnell
kept the puck in the offensive
zone The Nighthawks took an
early lead thanks to goals (two)
by Steve Margarita, Jennings,
and Wilner. Loras roared back
with four goals in the third period
to win 8-4. Dave Peterson
ﬁnished with 29 saves.

Black quarterbacks have finally arrived

preponderance of black QBs was
thus attributed to sheer athletic
ability rather than mental or
reasoning capacity. Sound

collegiate quarterbacks are black.

a born winner. And most
importantly, they‘re all black.

Two prominent bowl games,
both of which featured black
quarterbacks, really brought this
issue into the spotlight. The
Rose Bowl, the ”granddaddy” of
all bowl games. paired
Michigan's Demetrius Brown
against USC‘s Rodney Pecte, a
sure-fire first-round draft choice
this spring,

The majority of attention,
however, was directed toward the
Fiesta Bowl, the mythical
national championship featuring
undefeated heavyweights West
Virginia and Notre Dame. It also
sported the likes of Mountaineer
Major Harris, a speedy
sophomore who can also throw
the ball 50 yards while down on
one knee, and the Fighting Irish‘s
Tony Rice. who put icing on the
cake for black quarterbacks
everywhere by capturing the
game's MVP.

Such much-needed changes
are slowly taking place in
professional football as well.

are black. And 1115'. in case you
were wondering, the game's
MVP went to Cunningham.

These isolated incidents carry
widespread ramiﬁcations. Acting
as role models, these young
athletes—in college and the
pros—portray invaluable images
which for too long went
unnoticed. Black children on the
playground will no longer swal-
low thcir dreams of playing
quarterback for a professional
team.

Accepting blacks as true
quarterbacks is a first step in
combating racism. The step
becomes even bigger in the two
year wakc of the infamous
statements made by Jimmy "The
Grcck" Snyder and Al Campanis
which alluded to (among other
things) the intellectual inferiority

ofblacks.
our society has an awfully

long way to go in combating
racism. The emergence of the
black quarterback, while
undeniably minuscule in the
grand scheme of things, is
undoubtedly a step in the right
direction.

Maybe it will inspire people
to address the deanh of blacks in
the upper eschelons of
managemenL

Track set to
openindoor
season

by Luc Hadestad

The track team began
practices this week in preparation
for its upcoming indoor season.
The women‘s squad currently has
18 members while the men boast
a record 50 participants.

Although each group lost
several key runners to graduation.
a strong recruiting season has
replenished the team
considerably. Coach . Will
Freeman sees his squad as fairly
well-balanced, but particulme
strong in distance, pole vaulting,
hurdles, sprints, and the long
jump. Evelyn Freeman, coach of
the women‘s team, has an
unusually talented group of
sprinters to go with the
perennially competitive
contingent of distance runners.
Both coaches emphasized the
rarity of a men‘s team being
dominated by exceptional dismcc
runners and having a women’s
team highlighted by sprinters.

The principal difference
between indoor and outdoor track
is the size of the track, which is
no more than 200 meters indoors
while up to 400 meters outdoors.
In addition, events such as the
discus and javclin throws cannot
be held indoors for obvious
reasons.

Grinncll teams have
traditionally been more
competitive during the indoor
season. The coaches feel mat the
predominating reason for this is
the academic stress experienced
by the runners in the period
leading up to the outdoor
confercncc meet, which normally
takes place just prior to finals
week.

The two teams will elect
captains this week as they prepare
for a “practice" meet with Grand
View on Saturday at 10 am. at
the PEC, This will be the last
chance to see the runners at home
until they host the outdoor
conference meet on May 12 and
13 at Grinncll High School.
