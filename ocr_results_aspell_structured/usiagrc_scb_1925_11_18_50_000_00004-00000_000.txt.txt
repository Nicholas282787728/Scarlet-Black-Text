Have Good Case for

for the arrirnv tire. introduced tire
into his ope in remarks on rice -
lights, on arttticly mounted clocii,
Couer island. the quality at mercy,
and some other trh al points. He-
elaborated upon the analogy hrci
up by the t st speaker, or the train
and the ar ~ and immunities and the
sciences. He said that the arts uc—
eupied the observation car while sci-
ence ran the engine; science is for
man and arts for but a few. The
scientific attitude is solving problems
of national and international difficul-
ties.

Delvin l’omllnr Speaker

Patrick Devlin won his audience
from the start by saying that he would
not waste time but would begin to
disagree with them immediately. Af-
ter refuting several arguments
brought up by the affirmative, he es—
tablished the point that science is
the hand-maiden of art. He brought

'ont one of the strongest arguments
for his case when he said that the
arts and humanities are the greater
criterion of human happiness; com—
iort is only a small part, but happi—
ness is essentially a state of mind;
poor men are generally happier than
rich men. ,

Smith in his speech had pointed out
that the English speakers were il-
lumined by electric lights, a product
0: science. This Devlin humorously
answered by saying that he did not
think the audience would come to see
the lights burn it the English speakn
ers were not here.

James Work continued the affirm—
ative by saying that the question was
quite simple, the future of the human
race, something which has never yet
been lathomed. In refutation he arg-
ued that man is happier in a demo;
cratio country founded on the social
sciences than he was in the time at
Nero when arts and humanities rule
ed. Science has broken the shackles
on intellectual and spiritual freedom:
it has given us a ﬁner conception of
an umnipotent God.

Science Disnrrrecs

In concluding the constructive
speeches of the debate, Geoffrey
Lloyd exposed some of the disagree
ments in science. As for the idea of
democracy, it was born in the mind of
Rousseau, he‘ said. Tim Medieval
sertdom of the peasantry chained them
'to the ﬁelds no more than present
scientific factory methods have chain—
-ed the laborer to one spot. The wear—
no treaty and the Dawes plan are in
Themselves instruments for the mo-
"motion of freedom, he concluded.

The negro slavery problem in the
United states and other countries
arose trom scientific needs, said Mr.
Ramsey in rebuttal for the negative,
and it was done away with by a wave
or humanism.

Work Gites indin,

in his final rebuttal Work summed
up the argument for Grinneii and in
closing proposed that the members ot
ﬁle Cambridge team return to Eng-
land and run for the House ot Com-
mons an the policy of letting India.
have self government because of the
fact that civilization of that country
had been solely concerned with the
arts and humanities and not with sci—
ence.

Devlin and Lloyd of the Cambridge
mam left shortly after the debatit for
Chicago but Michael Ramsey, captain
oi the team remained in Grinnell un—
lil Monday morning. He Occupied
rooms in Building TWO during his
stay. Sunday noon he was the guest

Word From Editor.

Word has filtered forth from the}
office or the Molteasei- editor that the
next issue of the "old Cat," will he a
Christmas number. appearing just her
[are Thanksgiving. By bringing out
the hallday issue a, month in advance,
the Maiteaser joins the ranks of those
national magazines which operate on‘
a seasonal basis.

According to Harry Lambly, the od—
itor, contributions are of a better
quality than ever before. Among
other features. Henry Ozanne, of the
Des Moines Register, will have sev—
eral poems in print tor the first
time. The headliner of the book sec-
tion will be a review of Colonel w
liam Mitchell's “Winged Defense," hyl
Admiral Motfct. director of the naval
air forces. There will also be several
contributions from the pen of Tom
Burmws, a. Grlnllell graduate and
professional illustrator DOW residing
in California.

An indication 0f the enthusiasm
with which ﬁle new Maltehser has
been received is shown, by the fact
ll, was sold out on all the state news
stands within 9. week aftsr publica—
tion. At one news stand in Grinnell
the number of copies of the fir-st is—
sue which were sold euualled the
total number sold there for four 15c
sues last year. The advertising is
almost wholly of a national or state
character, and in general the edi- .
torinl and business staffs hope to
justify the popularity which the Male;
teaser has achieved.
