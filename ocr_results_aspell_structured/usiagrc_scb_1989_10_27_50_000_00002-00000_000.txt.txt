trustees have established a new reli-
gious studies professorship in honor

chairman, at a Scholars' Convoca—
tion lecture in Herrick Chapel Oct.
12, Professor Harold Kasimow has
been named the first holder of the
chair, the George A. Drake Profesv
sorship in Religious Studies.

“Grinnell College is recognized
nationally, and indeed intemation-
ally." LaLier said, “as among the
genuine leaders in liberal~ans edu-
cation largely because President
Drake. beginning his eleventh year
as president, has broughtthe college
to the forefront position it holds
today."

Lazier announced the creation of
the Drake chair — very unusual
because ithonors a currentpresident
of the college * after a Gates Lec-
ture by Rev. William Sloane Coffin,
prominent peace activist and presiv
dent of SANE/Freezc, a nuclear
disarmament organization.

Lazier said he chose the occasion
of the Gates Lecture, named for one
of Grinnell’s most forwardrlooking
presidents who encouraged bodt
religious thoughtand social congem,
“to honor anotherofGrinnell‘s most
forward-looking presidents # one
who also encourages this kind of
thought and concem.” The Gates
Lecture series is named for George
Augustus Gates. college president
from 1887 to 1900.

“The board of trustees feels that it
is time to give credit where credit is
due, And we wish to do this in the
midst of Mr, Drake's presidency,
not at some remote future date. We
also wish to do it appropriately, in a
way thatwill beneﬁt the college, for
we know that only in that way will
President Drake accept recognition
of any kind,” Lazier said.

Members of the Grinnell College
board have provided the funds for
the Drake chair.

rold Kasimow as “richly deserving”
of the chair.

“When I took the job, was elected .

as president, I told the board what]
thoughtthecollegeneeded was eight
to 10 years of stable presidency,”
Drake said. “And here I‘ve finished
10 years, so I guess they felt I‘d at

» least fulfilled what I’d set outto do,

George Drake.

A special luncheon held in Drake’s
honor following the Scholars’ Con-
vocation featured a presentation by
Drake’s mentor at Oxford Univer-
sity, Ralph H. C. Davis, emeritus
professor of medieval history at the
University of Birmingham and
Emeritus Fellow at Merton College
of Oxford University, Davis spoke
on “education, Oxford style."

Drake said he was told about the
board’s idea of endowing a chair
during the summer. He agreed the
move to name a chair after a current
president. rather than a retired one,
was unorthodox,

“When I met. with Bill Lazier and
Joe Rosenfield, they told me about
this.” Drake said. “And I said,Joc, I
want to question the appropriateness
of this because I’m still functioning
as president of the college. And Joe
said, ‘Aw, we’re not building a
monument, we’re just endowing a
Chain,"

“1 was bound to be a little bit
concerned with recognition of this
typcmaybebeingprematurc,”Drake
said. But he said he was “obviously
pleased to have that recognition from
the peoplewho employ me, from my
bosses, so to speak."

Drake said that religious studies
had "risen to the top of the list" as a
department deserving an exua fac-
ulty member. Drake described I-Ia-

The D.J.‘s chair is empty and the switchboard is dead at KDIC:
where a faulty transmitter has forced the station off the air, Com:
plaints and threats to contact the FCC about KDIC's interference

with public radio prompted the station’s shutdown.

KDIC Falls Silent :

By Brendan Shepherd

During a recent bright autumn
morning in central Iowa. a reserved
and dignified middle-aged couple
sat down to a breakfast of A11»Bran
and croissants. They attempted to
tune in their radio to the local public
station to hear the baroque music
that would really put zip into their
day.

Totheirhorror,theradioemitteda
hideousscreechingotherwiseknown
asKDIC‘s‘SingalongwithJia'rand
Omar." . , .

They quickly tried to tune in any
other station but all they heard were
the voices from Hell. After a frantic
yet fruitless scan up and down the
dial the horrified couple ran from
their home screaming, “KDIC has
taken over the airwaves! Run for
your lives!"

A maniacal station manager's evil
fantasy? Not quite. The culprit in
thisreal-life horrorstory wasafaulty
transmitter, which was causing the
college’s own KDIC to interferewith
other stations‘ broadcasts before fall
break.KDIC 88.5 FMhassincebcen

Yet, station manager Kate Nosan
Said she hopes the transmitter will be
repaired soon and that KDIC should
resume broadcasts as early as next
week.

The illegalovervmodulating—not
holding to theassigned frequency—
began early this month and local
listeners voiced theirdissatisf action.
Nosan said she received “many,
many complaints” concerning the
station’sinterferingwith otherbroadr

casts, particularly with WOI 901,
the Iowa carrier of National Public
Radio. College president George
Drakesaidhealsoreceivedstronglyr
worded complaints from several
faculty members concerning the
over-modulation. (

“One of them said that if the col-
lege couldn’t handle it, the FCC
could,” Drake said. He saidthatsuch
action would not have been out of
line because the FCC is “ultimately
responsible.” ‘

“The Station is pan of the publir
domain," he said. “It reaches out39
miles from Grinnell, so we should
behave responsibly according to
governmental regulations." .

Since the station is in the process
of renewing its broadcast license, a
KDIC memo smted, “We want to
avoidafonnalcomplaintatallcostst’
Nosan said that the station did not
want any altcrcations with the com:
munity and that “We are doing eves
rything we can to fix the problem};

Drake agreed that the college is
doing all it can to remedy the situ‘-
ation. “It’s just one of those things
we have to fix,” Drake said, “Things
break.”

After an unsuccessful attempt tit
fix the problem before fall break, the
company that services KDIC deter;
mined that the transmitter should be
sent back to the manufacturer for
proper inspection and repair. “They
thought it would be better to send it
out because they weren’t quite sure
whattl‘teproblcmswerc,"Nosansaid.

Theories explaining the overt»
modulation include a short in the
transmitter or the possibility that the
antenna was struck by lightning:
Nosan said. .

Drake said the repairs would be
funded by the college’s renovations
and repairs budget. He estimated the
costofmerely insuring and shipping
the transmitter at over $1,000. v

After it is inspected and repaired
“itcould berather expensive,” Drake
said. “I hope we can get the problem
corrected as quickly as possible and
get back on the air,” Drake said. ‘
