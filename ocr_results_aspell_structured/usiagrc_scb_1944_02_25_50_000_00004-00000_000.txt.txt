Iwanski and Co. began to click,
with five field goals, for ten
points. The Macy men held their
own however, the half ending
with a 10-10 tie.

Cautious ball handling and)
quite a few poor passes charac-
terized the first half. Iwanski,I
generally the point getter for his
aggregation, was unable to do
much damage With those down-

the-center swishers. He almost
always had a man on him, and
those times that he managed to
get clear did not produce his us-
ual share of two-pointers.

The opening stanza of the last‘
half saw Dave itnoit pull a couple
of sensational plays, whisking- the
hall out of the defensive guards
hands and racing the length of
the court to sink a lay—up. After

Muyskeli’s work under the basket
