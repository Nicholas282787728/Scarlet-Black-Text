ls Grinnell Need

Pioneer Power
Bogs Down
In Knox Game

Scoring punch remained the
weakest point of the Pioneer
football team as they downed

Knox Saturday 12 to 0.
Filing up 19 first downs to

their opponents eight and out-

gaiiiing the lads from Old Siwash .

330 yards to 103, the scarlet and
black clad gl'irlders' power was
far greater than the score indi—
cates,

Bishop Stars

Curly Bishop's speed in getting
under punts kept Knox’s yardage
for punt returns at absolute zero.
The tightening of Grinnell's pass
defense the second half promises
fewer worries in that department
for Crinnell followers the rest of
the season.

Harry Waters came within in-
ches of scoring a touchdown. This
sophomore end was the hardest
runner on the field Saturday To
quote an observer, "Waters runs
like a Wild man!

McCartney Is Outstanding

In the pass catching depart
ment, Hugh McCartney and Lefty
Sory both had glue on their
dukes Until he was injured, Ed
Nagel was the best passer and
ball carrier on the field. After
mat, it was Augie Cruening and
Murray Richards who carried the
mail, and Tiger Hamann and Don
Hippie who were tossing the [Mgr
skin,

As usual, Capmin Louis “Meat—
ball" Gonias was outstanding in
the line. But the entire Pioneer
forward wall showed a good
brand of ball.

Prepare for Parsons

Yesterday the squad went
through a light workout in prep-
aration for Friday night's game
with Parsons. Ed Nagel is still
suffering from the head bruise
which bothered him Saturday of-
ternoon and won’t be working
much this week. Tod Kennefick
and Harold Jekel have leg inn
juries.

Parsons comes here with a
strong aggregation. They swamp-
ed Carthage 40 to 0 Saturday and
made 20 first downs. In fullback
’wayne Harrell, Parsons has an
exceptionally hard charging back.
He consistently ripped the Carth~
age line for long gains,

Ripon and Monmoul'll
Favored This Week
ln Conference Games

\Ionmouth college moved into o
Ii st place tie with the itipon
Rerllneil last weekend as the
Ilinois eleven downed Coe, 14
to 0, while Ripon was losing a
nonrrcllfel'ence game to Bradley
Tech of Peoria, 7 to 6,

In the games this week, the
Redmen of Ripon, \Vis., are heavy
favorites to win their third cone
ference game when they tang1e
with the Beloit Blue Devils, who
have yet to taste victory.

Monmouth and Lawrence tangle
at Monmouth, which should give
the Fighting Scots a slight edge
over the Vikings. Coe entertains
Cornell on Saturday. The Purple
from Mount Vernon have the
slightly better team, but will be
playing the Kohawks at Cedar
Rapids before a Homecoming
crowd, which puts both teams on
about the same level.

stepping out of loop circles
this weekend, Crinnell will play
host to Parsons college of Fair-
field, while James Millikin uni-
versity will battle Knox,

The Parsons eleven, in its
Homecoming game last Saturday
rolled over Carthage college to
the tune of 40 to 0.
