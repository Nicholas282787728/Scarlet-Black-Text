On Intellectual Comment

In last week's issue of the Scarlet and Black, Dr.

Kuntz expressed the opinion that pmore space should be
given to matters of intellectual and international import-
ance.‘Tllis week another letter writer agrees.

The 8&3 has a long-standing policy (used infrequent-
ly, however) of printing thoughtful commentary on sub-
jects related to timely topics of interest. This, we believe,
is a newspaper’s function. It is the province of a. campus
magazine to discuss subjects not related to topics of central
interest. Insofar as the letter'writers urge us to fulfill the
newspaper’s function, we feel, they have made a good sug-
gestion.

Both writers complain of editorial comment limited ill
.scope to the campus. For the S&B to take an editorial stand
on international matters would be foolllal'dy, at least. We
would only be exposing our ignorance t0 the ridicule of
authorities. In commenting upon campus affairs, we try
to apply mature values to the situation we are in, leaving
to more capable counselors the tosl: of guiding our think-
ing on theoretical levels.

HURRAH for the sc
paign:

BEGUN with a laborious, un-
‘balanced, hearty-and-halfehearte
ed campaign,

CONTINUED with speaking

and questioning,

CONFUSED by a week ot
“political activity," during which
politics made strange bedfellows
and some stooped to conquer,

CLlMAXED by the conven-
tion—a monumental miscarriage,

AND ANTI-CLIMAXED by

an election, in which 31% of

the campus voted and the vic-
tor was proclaimed by a mar-
gin or 20 votes.

This reviews the campaign. As
for the coming year or student
government: some will sit back
and watch, some will sit back
and talk, some will work. We’ll

need workers.

Tu nll my lriends:

i want to extend my deepest
appreciation to all of you who
worked so hard and devotedly
during our recent campaign.

1 truly ieel that one oi the
prime objectives of my plate
iorm, namely to stimulate and
maintain interest in student
government has in large part
been carried out by- your air
toits, and 1 am convinced that
-it will wntlnue to be a major
obiectivc of the new president.

An eighty/Ame per cent turn
out for the election speaks well
in studcnt government and in-
sures its continuance as a vital
going concern on the Grinnell
campus.

With no regrets and a sense
or accomplishment, I want to
thank you all once again and
express the hope that_you w
show’ in the coming months the
same sincere interest in student
government that you did in my
campaign. if so, l have the high»
est hope for the iuture or the
Grinncll Student Council.

Sincerely,
Tom Skornia

To the Editor:

Hui‘ra‘h for Dr. Kuntz! At
last someone has said what has
needed to be said for quite
some time.

Last week, the Congress of
the United States debated meas-
ures which could mean a vital
change in American torcign pol-
icy and the lives oi all of us.
and committees oi the Congress
debated measures for the pro-‘
tection of the basic freedoms of
several million of our Negro
citizens ,

A noted scholar delivered
two lectures on ,English his-
tory, historical research in
general, and the Puritan tra—
dition, a basic concept of
American life. Another schol—
ar delivered a lecture on Hin-
duism, one of the greatest of
religious teachings,

As students at one of the
country's leading liberal arts
colleges, and as the future in
tellectual leaders of the nation,
it might be assumed that we
would be interested in the
above happenings. ‘We might
even be thought to have intel-
ligent ideas on these subjects it
might further be supposed that
