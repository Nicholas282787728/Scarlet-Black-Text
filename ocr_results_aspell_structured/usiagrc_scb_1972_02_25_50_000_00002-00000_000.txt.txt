The SCarlet and Black

Questions On Contract Renewal

Partly because of the controversy
surrounding the contract of Alan
Nasser, Philosophy, campus in,
terest in the College's faculty cone
tract renewal process is increasing.
The increased interest has revealed
both a dissatisfaction with and an
ignorance about this important part
of college policy.

According to a member ofthe Exe—
cutive Council, information pertaina
ing. to the evaluation of a faculty
member falls into three categories:
1) teaching, 2) scholarship, and a)
service to the college.

Information regarding teaching is
obtained in the form of student EPC
recommendations and the evaluation
of the department chairman which
includes views of faculty in the de-
partment. Information regarding
scholarship is received in letters
written by other people in the tier
partment and through a "vita” »
a listing of the individual's accome
plishments and services to the col-
lege community prepared by the fac-
ulty member himself. Finally, infor-
mation pertaining to college service
is collected from the vita and letters
from members of other committees
on which the individual has served,
usually written by the chairmen of
those committees.

Because student input into the seer
0nd and third categories is marginal
at best, the weight given the three
categories of information is a
crucial factor.

In the first category, while in
practice the department chairman is
supposed to attach all the different
inputs in his recommendation to the
Council, the importance given those
inputs is a matter of the chairman‘s
discretion Because this is the first
year of formalized Student input in
the evaluation process, the Council
member said, there is as yet no good
way to gauge the relative weight of
the criteria.

The faculty questionnaires turned
in by students last January do not
figure in this year’s recontracting
decisions although they will in '7
"73: The questionnaires will be re»
turned to the individual instructors
with the personal data deleted The
computer tabulations which include
the data will go to the Executive
Council but not to the department.)

In cases of promotion and tenure,
the recommendation of the depart—
ment chairman goes to an intermede
iate divisional personnel committee
composed of tenured professors and
associate professors and chaired by
the division chairman. In cases of
common contract renewal, however,
this intermediate committee is by
passed and the department chair
man’s recommendation goes directr
ly to the Executive Council. At no
time does the Executive Council Suh-
committee on Educational Policies
see or consider personnel questions.

in every case there are provisions
for the individual to present his case
personally to the Executive Council.

The Executive Council is notbound
to approve the department chair-
man’s recommendation, and it is not
uncommon, the council member
said, for the department chairman to
be overruled. This has in fact hap»
pened several times this year. When

the department chairman is over
ruled by the Executive Council, it
usually reﬂects lhe concern with all
college considerations instead of
departmental ones, he said.

The Executive Council recommen-
dation goes ultimately to lhe-Presi—
dent for decision. Although the Pres-
ident has the option of overruling
their recommendation, the council
member said that this has been
“very rare."

Most student Crilicism of the face
ulty selection process centers
around two points. The first is that
the departmental EPCs have an
uneven and unreliable effect on de-
partment’s decisions. That is,while
some EPCs seem to be satisfied
with their input into their depart-
ments, others have complained. for
example, about faculty autocracy and
railroading of the student EPCs,
Some EPC memers have menlloned
the more obvious factor of indirect
pressure. springing from a major's
natural reluctance to oppose what
seems to be the strong consensus
of the prolessors in his department.

More student dissatisfaction cen—
ters around the fact that there are
no students on the Executive Counv
cil. The general consensus oi those
willing to express an opinion seems
to be that there should be voting
students on the Executive Council.
But there is strong faculty opposi-
tion to this idea.

Senior Bill Thomas, who has been
trying for some years to get stu—
dents a larger voice in faculty eval-
nation, has suggested elevating the
Six students (SGA President, three
divisional representatives, mem»
bereat-Iarge, and CBS representar
live) on the Executive Council Sub
Committee on Educational Policies

to the Executive Council proper. If
this is not feasible, he thinks it
should still be pretty easy organi-
zationally to secure student input
at the Executive Council level.

Other student suggestions parallel
Thomas’s. Chip Shofstall, candi-
date for SGA president, has sug-
gested that students should have
voting power on the level of the

\Executive Council. He comments
that “Student representation in lese
ser capacities seems rather spe-
cious \when all decisions must ul»
timately meet the approval of the
‘student absent' Executive Coun-
cil,”

Carolyn Ashhaugh, who is a mem~
her of the history department's
EPC has suggested that students
should ”count at least 50%" in the
making ofpersonnel decisions. How
ever, she is uncerlain as to the best
method for implementing this, and
hesitates to trust solely in an Exe-
cutive Council that includes
students.

"i see a certain danger of being
co-opted on committees,” she says.

Faculty seem to be fairly strong in
their reluctance, as one of them put
it, “to share the final power.” Most
seem to feel they should be evalu»
ated principally by their colleagues.
Many will concede the importance
of some student input, but feel it
should come into play at a lower
level, and that final evaluation should
be done by an Executive Council of
faculty and administration personnel
only.

The students interested in the prob-
lem are aware of the difficulty of
overcoming taculty resistance. But,
one of them said, ”I think it’s pos»
sible there could be some changes.
After all, they said they would
never change the open rules.”

To Occupy White House

After the end of the Current aca-
demic year, the administrative of-
fices of the college will have moved
to the White House at 1121 Park
Street. The house, across the street
from Goodnow Hall. until this year
has been used as off-campus living
quarters for about twelve students,
who have now found a new home at
1130 East.

The move is part of a two-part
relocation'of offices begun last sum-
mer with the transfer of Student
Deans to the South Campus Recep-
tion Center between Haimes and
James. The present move will in-
clude the offices of the President
of the College, the Dean ofAdminis-
lration, the Dean of the college, the
Registrar, and the Business Office
The renovation of White House has
taken the full academic year to
complete primarily because all the
work Is being done by'physical plant
employees as they have time. The
furnishings will be essentially those
now used in Burling, but the reno-
vations include improvements to the
exterior, new lighting, heating, and
air»conditioning. Total expenses
will amount to about $40,000.

Donald Irving, English, will submit

Correct Story
On library

Because of time limitations in the
writing of last week’s newsrstory on
the transformation of Burling‘s
Twentieth Century Room the pre-
ceding evening, several errors of
fact were apparently made.

First, the lead sentence should
not have stated that Mr. Thornton
deshelved books from the Twentieth
Century Room. Although Thornton
assisted students who were'taking
part in transforming the room into
a de facto Black Library, and al~
though he took hooks off Shelves in
other parts of the library, ‘no rer
porter saw him deshelve books in
the Twentieth Century Room, and he
denies that he did that.

The deshelving and moving olbooks
in the Twentieth Century Room oc-
curred just after a meeting of the
Executive Council with the full time
professional faculty women; there is
no Women's Search Committee as
such and not all Search Committee
members were present.

Dean Walker’s remarks to the
black students as they left the li-
brary referred to their leaving,
not their action in Twentieth Cen-
tury Room. as might be inferred.

The new Spring styles
are in at Bang’s.

It’s all new for you.
