JEANNE BARBER. LEADS Y. W.

Discusses “The Ruth of the Twen-
tieth Century,”

In treating the subject "The Ruth
of the Twentieth Century," at Y. 'W.
Thursday night, Jeanne Barber based
her talk on the story or Ruth and
Naomi. Altho’ this is a familiar Bible
story, Miss Barber presented it in n
way which brought out a. number or
points not usually emphasized. Most
or all, Ruth should serve as in model
to the young women of the twentieth
century of one who stood primarily
for simplicity, for doing what she re.
garded as her duty in an uuosfeniae
tious war. It is in her character that
the element of self-forgetfulness is has
mil-ably shown.

When Ruth left her native land to
go with her mother-i law, she did this
with no hope of reward or public 111%
provul. It is the Del‘formance of our
daily tasks without the promise ol
commendation or personal advantage
which is one or the real problems to

the American girl.
