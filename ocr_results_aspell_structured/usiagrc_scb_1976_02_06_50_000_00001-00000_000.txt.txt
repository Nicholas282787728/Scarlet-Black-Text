System needs reform

An elaborate committee

'structure has been set up at
Grinnell to deal with student
services. However, dissatisfaction
is running high with this structure.
SGA President Will Collins said, “I
don’t think the committee struc-
ture has been very effective.”
Members of various committees
express the same sentiment; many
of them say that they do not know
what their committee is supposed
to do and have rarely met. Others,
though they can relate specific
accomplishments oi their com-
mittee, express little satisfaction
with its operation.

The lack of input from students
other than those on the committee
is cited as a major pitiall oi the
current system. Meetings have not
been publicized and most students
don’t know what goes on in com-
mittees or when they meet. “The
opportunity [or student input is
very great. However. that op
portunity has not been utilized
effectively," Collins stated. Collins
and Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman have talked about
reorganizing the committee
structure.

Tederman suggested that a
single residential life committee be
established. It would be composed
of faculty, administrators and
students. Tederman suggested that
the members could meet once a
week in the Forum where they and
others could talk about any aspect
or campus lite. Tederman ex.
plained that subcommittees could
be set up {or specific problems
instead of having numerous
standing committees such as
presently exist. Collins mentioned
that he and Tederman would
present a plan to SGA in “the near
future.”

The subcommittees on the
Facilities and Food Service,
Health Service, and Forum make
up the Committee on Student
Services which reviews policy
issues in these areas. The sub-
committees pass on decisions to
the Student Services, which, in
turn, reviews policy issues. The
subcommittees pass on decisions
to the Student Service Committee,
which presents them to the
President. Thus far, the committee
has met about four times. Ac~
cording to Ralph Pomerank,
director of college services and a
member of the committee, there is
no established meeting date
because it meets only when
problems arise.

The Facilities and Food Service‘

Subcommittee has been primarily
concerned with SAGA. Last.
semester the weekly meetings
were spent going through the
Sounding Board evaluations and
checking with the SAGA managers
to see if conditions causing com-
plaints had been corrected.
Several members have expressed
frustration because they were
dealing solely with minor details.

At a meeting Wednesday afr
ternoon, the subcommittee decided
to recommend to the ad,
ministration that alternatives to
SAGA be investigated At the
meeting, Pomerank explained that
though the administration claims
they are continually looking for
alternatives to SAGA, no food
service representatives have
visited the campus or made any

alternative bids for the past five or

six years. In view of these iacts the
members at the subcommittee felt
that the students had nothing to
lose and everything to gain by
encouraging the administration to
examine alternative iood services.
Committee member Marca Fox
commented that she felt it imr
portant that committee members
be notiﬁed when various
representatives are on campus so
they can be contacted by students.

Besides going over Sounding
Boards, the subcommittee has this
year instituted a change in dinner
hours for Cowles, established no-
smoking areas in the dining rooms,
and established PDRS at Cowles
and Quad. Presently they are
trying to get more outside lighting
in front of Cowles and get a trunk
room on both North and South
turned into bike rooms.

The Health Service Sub-
committee deals mainly with the
Health Center. First semester it
only met twice. However, this
semester they plan to meet every
two weeks at 5 pm. on Thursdays.
Russ Damtoit commented that the
committee hadn't been able to do
much. This semester, the com-
mittee will plan to organize coffee
hours during New Student Days
where students and doctors can
meet and talk. Informed by Dean
Walker that the Health Center
budget has to be cut by $10,000, Hie
committee has tentatively decided
to change the 24-hour nursing to
daytime nursing only.

The Forum Subcommittee has
only twa members, student David
Blough and Tom Latirner, director
oi the Forum. The committee has
met formally only once, though
Latimer said he and Blough keep in
regular contact. This year they
decided to buy a new movie

projector and set up the student art
gallery in the Forum basement. in
the future, the two will be making
decisions about the use of Forum
offices vacated by persons moving
to Fell House.

The Committee on Counseling is
the overseer for all counseling
functions: RA’s, SA’s, Student
Affairs, Career Services, Mental
Health Center reports, and reports
from Career Services, which are
used to coordinate the
organizations and to work for
advancement in their programs.

They have had about one
meeting every two weeks which,
according to Tederman is open “in
spirit” to the general public.
However, only committee mem-
bers attend meetings due to the
lack of publication of meeting
dates and problems in setting
meeting times. Thus far this year,
the committee has been working on
an and SA evaluations, interviews
for RA candidates and an open
position in Student Affairs,
organizing a subcommittee to deal

with alcohol and drug problems. ,

initiating an alcohol conference
next week, and reviewing the RA

and SA selection process. The ‘

majority or the proposals are
initiated by committee members
after talking to students. Ray
Obermiller, director oi academic
advising and a member of the
committee, feels the committee
works well and depends basically
on interests of the members. In
contrast, Rick DiHello, also a
member of the committee,
believes that the committee does
little. He explained that it
primarily approved proposals
submitted to it by Student Affairs.
The continuing review of social
policies and regulations is done by
the Committee on Social Policies
and Regulations The Ad Hoc
Subcommittee on Housing, which
deals with housing decisions, is
part of this Committee. The
general consensus among mem-
bers of the committee is that its
duties are vague. ”I’ve never
understood our jurisdiction," said
member Wayne Passmore.
Committee A is defined as an
advisory committee to the
president. Composed of SGA
cabinet members and top ad-
ministration personnel, it sup-
posedly considers proposals made
by one of the three committees.
However, the committee has not
convened [or the last several
years. Tederman said the com-
mittee is no longer functioning and
needs to be replaced by a single
residential life committee.

Cohen
chosen

by Doug Schultz

Junior Matt Cohen was
nominated and confirmed by the
Joint Board Wednesday night as
Student Coordinator for the
remaining semester.

The job of Student Coordinator
consists of overseeing student
services, receiving complaints and
suggestions from students and
sitting in the SGA cabinet.

According to the SGA Gon-
stitution, the Joint Board normally
would not select a candidate
confirmation, but only conﬁrm the
cabinet's nomination of an in~
dividual.

However, as Will Collins, SGA
president, explained at- the
meeting Wednesday night, the
members of the Cabinet reduce the
ﬁeld of applicants to threo
possibilitiesinamely, Cohen, Mitre
Gelbort. presently an assistant
coordinator, and Terry Yasdicl
Rather than “flip coins" as Coilinl
said, they decided to put the ﬁnd
nomination before a larger body.

Questions have subsequently
been raised as to the con-
stitutionality oi the procedure.
Nevertheless. the Joint Board
confirmed its own nomination by I
Vote of 19 to 2.

Matt Cohen

The position of Assistant
Coordinator has yet to be decided,
although the Constitution grants
Cohen the power to appoint an
assistant, but it is unclear whether
he has the power or the desire to
relieve Gelbort.

As coordinator, Cohen said he
would investigate four areas of
student life. He would evaluate
committee structures, because he
said that many of them seem to
have conﬂicting jurisdictions. He
would also investigate the aft
{ectiveness of the EPCs, the
quality of the food service and the
budgetary accountability of the
various campus media, in ad-
dition, Cohen said he would like to
see a student loan service
established and committee
meeting times and agendas posted.

Anyone interested in being
considered for assistant and has
not applied yet should contact Matt
Cohen by Sunday or put a note in
Box 14.
