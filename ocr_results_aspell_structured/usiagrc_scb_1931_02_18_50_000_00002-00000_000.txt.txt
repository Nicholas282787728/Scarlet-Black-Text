STOP DORMITORY THLEVERY

Thievery at Grinncll college, especially ill the
men‘s dormitories. has rcachcd 1i stage which ilc-
ccssitatcs immediate action. More mention of the
fact at housc meetings has resulted in only tempor-
ary comment. It is now time, to stop the crime by
apprehending the guilty ones and punishing thcin
severely.

The Scarlet and Black understands that it is
making a cl'ions charge. Some tlticvc . exists in
most llil crsilv alld college fraternities . ororities,
and dormitories, but the alllount that has been ill
c: tcilcc in the men’s halls at Grrinncll college
tllls year is appalling. Residents of two of the
houses have suffered practically continual losses
since September.

J clvclry and money have generally been stolen.
The college attempted to thwart theft three years
ago this spring. when it installed nightelachs on
doors opclling onto the halls in the dormitories.
This curbed the crime for the remainder of the
semester. Hon-ever, students becanrc careless and
left the doors unlocked the following year. with the
result that thici'ory was again practiced.

If The Scarlet and Black’s mention of theft
is responsible for nothing more than an investiga-
tion, the paper will feel that it has accomplished
somctlliug by taking the initiative and voicing the
opinion of dormitory house mothers and many
Grinllcll men. as well as expressing the sincere
belief of the college publication itself.

TOWN AND GOWN AGAIN

Since the early days of university life. when
the campus hcdge providcd zl Sharp dividing line
for the differences of “Town and Gown.” the prob-
lem of keepingr collegians and citizens in harmony
has bccn one of major proportions.

Grillnell college has been singularly free from
differences of this Sort. That division line. per»
mittiilg much in some things but closely drawn in
others, has been observed well} by college studcllts.
There has been overstepping, of course. and but
for thc tact and understanding on the port of‘thc
chief of police, Alex Manson. serious complications
might have resulted ill some occasions.

The chief, howevcl', friend of collegizlns and
business men alike, and possessing an innate ability
to sec minor troubles from the viewpoint of both
the tlcail and the student, has been invaluable in
kccpillg the men of the college out of trouble.
Nearly all of them count him as their friend, and
are glad to stop for a short chat when they sec hiln
on duty down town. .

Daily papers often carry stories of arrests
lilzidc during ”th1 wcclt” activities at other col-
leges, and of‘prosccutions for collegiate pl‘m' .
While the students must realize the limits to which
they may go, iron clad tactics seldom succeed in a
pleasant understanding on either side. _ .

Chief Manson has managed a hard Job in an
admirable fashion. ﬂ

'MORE COPY!’

(From the University of B sii Columbia Uhyssey)
The editor sat in his cane botEom chair, ‘
Ran all his ﬁngers through all of his hair,
And wildly implored in a voice of despair

For copy.

Printers and 'phone were both sizzling hot

“That blankahle copy has got to be got!

We want it right. What we want is a lot
More copy!”

But still, the reporters all fervently swore
That they'd got all the news in the country and
more,
The editor raved as he traversed the ﬂoor
“More copy!”

The issue is out. Now we hear people tell

at a maniac held in a lone padded cell.

The poor ex-editor only can yell.

"More copy!"

STUDENT MOOCHERS ,
(From the University Daily Karisan)

You know the type, You see them and talk with
them every day. some act just as ordinary as usual,
while others are all sugar and sweetness as they await
their chance to beg one for lecture notes, reading notes.
or already-written experiments.

The moocher is an artist in cohcocting excuses for
failure of preparation. As a rule, he has bad so much
more work to do than anyone else that it really is not
his fault that he must mooch his notes or experiments.
He just. has not had time to get them all.

You have seen the student who has been given at
least two weeks for a certain amount of outside read-

lug, yet the night. before an examination he had not
been inside of the library. In panic he runs to his more

conscientious fraternity brother and pleads with tears

in his eyes for a chance to see the other‘s notes. To
climax the incident, the moneher goes to class the next
day will: “lady luck,” takes the quiz, and makes a better

score than his aide.

NOT KICKED OUT YET!
(From the Simpsonion)

When student-faculty conflict over publications is
the rule rather than the exception. it is refreshing to
read an editorial of the'following sort. The article was
written by the editor of the University Daily Kansan at
the close of his nine weeks’ period as editor.

The Kansas editor confesses "failure" because “he
and the oensoress are still speaking to each other." The
editor has been frequently tempted to bat her over the
head, to he sure, bilt never yet has he really done so,
except ﬁguratively.

“In the second place, no one has even offered personal
violence of any sort to the editorilet: alone giving it
to him. He has even had a few people agree with him.
Now that is a confession of ignorninious failure. If an
editor can't make some very faithful eneinios, enemies
willing to go to any length to harass him, he's a damned“
poor editor.

”And in the third place, he hasn’t. been kicked out of
school yet and perhaps may even iinish up the year.
Now that is a surprise, no more to others than to him,

“Well, such is life. None of us can expect supreme
perfection.

“'(This word is passed only because it's the editor's
last issue, and because the censoress was in a good
humorifor a change)"
