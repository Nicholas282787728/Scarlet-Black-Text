eral hotly contested Iowa
political races to be decided this No

ing voters on and off campus and

with their campaigns in a continua

returned to Grinnell and devoted the
afternoon to registering voters at a
trailer park and an apartment com-
plex in town.

Thirty to 40 people were regis-
tered in what Campus Democrat

“In one case,” said Lake in an
interview with the 5&8, “We regis»
Iered a person who had never regis»
tered before and could not read, and
had never had anyone to help her
register before."

The registration drives are, of
course, more than an altruistic at-
tempt to expand the electorate The
Democrats are trying to swing sev-
eral close races to the Democratic
side. Chief among these is the Iowa
gubernatorial race, in which Demo-
crat Bonnie Campbell is challenging
12—yearRepublicanineumbentTerry
Branstad. According to Lake.
Campbell is a few points ahead in the
polls, a galvanizing fact for Demor
crats since Iowa has had a Republi-
can govemor for the last 28 years.

Other DemocraLs the Democrats
are actively backing on the state-
wide level include Ann Pedcrson,
who is running a financially-
imbalanced race for Iowa Secretary
of State against privately wealthy
incumbentPaulDannyPate,and US.
House of Representatives candidate
Elaine Baxter, who is trying to unseat
incumbent Jim Ross Lightfoot in a
rematch of a 1992 race.

0n the local level, the Demo-
crats are working for State Senate
candidate Dennis Black and State
House candidate IohnTerpstra. Lake
says that many observers consider
Terpstra’s race “the hot race in the

where the political races are not so
close. In addition, Lake says that
candidates elected here can signil'tr
cantly affect the lives of Grinnell
students—he palm to cuts in Iowa
tuition grants that, he claims, were
the result of a Republican governor
and Iowa House of Representatives.
The Democrats have registered stu-
dents at registration for fall~semester
classes and have set up tables in the
post office. and now have appointed
“dorm captains" for each residence
hall who will take charge of registra-
tion efforts, going door-todoor in
their respective halls offering stu-
dents the opportunity to register.
Because prospective voters either
must re~register each time they move
or must obtain absentee ballots from
their previous place of residence. and
because in 1992 98% of those regis~
tered to vote on campus turned out to
vote, Lake and the Democrats feel

During a recent retail planning
session, the city outlined nine objec-
tives for attracting business to
Grinnell. she said.

Among these objectives are pro-
moting Grinnell to existing residents
and college students, recruiting po-
tential business, and developing
awareness of stores downtown in gen-
etal.

Grinnell is not an “island in a
stream," Embrce said. But it does

The sculpture was commissioned
a year ago by the Grinnell Art Acqui-

McKibbin. The artist,Robert Craig of
Drake University in Des Moines, was
selected by examining slides of avail-

“Essentially it‘s an abstraction of

Craig was struck by the architectural

Besides voter registration, the
Democrats do phone calling for can—

such as parades and dinners, distrib-

conventions, and host speakers here

example, the Democrats are holding
forums with candidates Black and
Terpstra this year, and hope to bring
