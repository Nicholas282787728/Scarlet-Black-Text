President Osgood addresses
his changes to academics

RKO’s tenure brought Fund for Excellence, MAPS, Arabic

BY CARLOS R. Lu

During President Russell K. Osgood’s
12-year tenure at Grinnell College, major
additions and improvements have been made
towards academics.

“I think we’ve had a strong academic
program when 1 came," Osgood said. "One
thing a president can do is screw things up,
and I think we have not done that. I think
we’ve enhanced what we've had."

The Fund for Excellence, which is m,
sponsrble for many or these changes, was a
Trustee-funded initiative that began nine
years ago. It catalyzed many now familiar
academic programs, including Mentored
Advanced Projects (MAPs) and the Japanese
language department, and also helped launch
the Faulconer Gallery

“It’s a major burst of academic change
during my time here at Grinnell College,"
Osgood said. The Fund also provided for the
creation ofthe Center ofthe Prairie Studies,
Center for Humanities and the Center for
International Studies.

Also stemming from the Fund fol Excel-
lence is the Expanding Knowledge Initiative
(EKJ) which brought many concentrations
and positions to various academic depart
ments, including Neuroscience, Earth sys-
tems Science, and Arabic, among other Cons
centrated ﬁelds otstudyThe BK], along with
an increasing student body, has increased the
faculty by 10%. Since President Osgood has
been in office, approximately 50% orthe cur
rent faculty was hired.

With this increase in faculty, President

Osgood says that he sees a "generational shift"
in Grinnell’s professors.

“The younger raculty are more interested
in producing scholarship," Osgood said. “The
College has attempted to meet that goal of the
faculty, by more junior leagues and more oppor
tunities for scholarship production."

Osgood believes this increased opportunity
for scholarship production correlates to better
teaching in the classroom, as well as attracting
the best faculty to come to Griilncll.

“The idea there would be that we have face
ulty who were either interdisciplinary or were
experts in new areas of knowledge, so for us, Ar-
abic is a new area ofkrlowledge,"Osgood said.

Osgood and the College have also created
additional opportunities for professors to pro-
duce scholarly work.

“We created a regular junior leave program
and senior leave program, which is funded out
of the base budget, which means ifyou’rc meri-
torious, you get a halfsemestcr off between sabr
baticals to allow you to prepare or work on your
scholarship," Osgood said.

Looking ahead, President Osgood believes
that the curriculum will inevitably change, cits
ing two reasons.

“Fol one, there’s a myth that liberal arts col-
leges' curricula don't change, but that is only a
myth. They are constantly Changing, And sect
oncl,l think the cross pressures on colleges and
universities are going to increase, and rightly so,
because how can we keep increasing tuition and
fees, and so I think that will affect the academic
program in some way, hopefully not in any sig-
nificant way."

In oidei to broaden the discussion of sexual
harassment at Grinncll, an independent group of
snidenis held a sexual assault and harassment f0,
rum in JRC 101 on Tuesday, May 4 at 7:30 pm.

Miriam Barcus '12 and Ellen Saliares '11,
both of whom attended AJust training over
spring break, organized the fonlm. When asked
if there was anything they could do to continue
their work, they both came up with the idea for
the forum,

“We sent out an e-mail to groups that would
potentially be interested in having worked on
topics like this before, but because most of those
groups already have the things that they do, we
wanted this to become a coming together point
ofall of that," Barcus said.

They contacted a number of other students
to assist in the event, including Adam Lange
’11, who also participated in Most training, and
Eleanor Nelson '10, who conducted a Mentored
Advanced Project on intimate partner violence.

“We collaboratively discussed what we wants
ed to be covered in the forum, how we wanted to
approach things, what things we could condense
and skim over, because obviously it's a huge is-
sue and can't be covered in an hour," said Zoe
Schein '12, a Feminist Action Coalition leader
who contributed research regarding myths con—
cerning sexual assault.

Around 40 students came to the forum. Afr
ter introductions, students were broken up into
small groups to discuss issues related to sexual
assault and harassment at Grinnell. At the door,
an information packet containing deﬁnitions of
sexual assault, harassment, intimate partner vio-
lence and statistics was distributed and used to
direct discussion. Each group discussion had its
own focus,but touched on such topics as aware-
ness of deﬁnitions, policies and institutional
changes that could help Grinnell become better
equipped to handle incidents or sexual harass-
ment and assault.

 

In one group, students discussed the
multitude of definitions that governed
policy at many different levels, from the
College’s own policy to the definition used
by the Department otlustice in determin~
ing cases of assault. With the wide range
of terms came problems of naming and
identifying specific issues, which the group
concluded was partially responsible for the
large number of unreported cases. To ad—
dress this, many students suggested insti-
tuting changes to the website to central
ize sexual assault and harassment policies,
owing to the apparent difficulty in finding
them through a simple search,

Close to the oneshour mark, the groups
reconvened for a larger discussion ofthe is-
sues, as well as the necessity of events like
the forum itself. One student mentioned
that Tuesday's fomm was his ﬁrst encoun—
ter with an event of that kind, which was a
shame, and that even on a campus as puts
portedly open and safe as Grinnell these is
sues still go un-discussed. There were calls
for future forums, and emphasis was placed
on the responsibility of individuals to re:
form behavior that encouraged silence and
tolerance ofsexual harassment.

“We just vans discussion, and people
to be able to talk about things they’re conv
cerned with, tlungs they’re confused about,"
said Sallares said. “And then we’re kind of
hoping this is something you’ll have with
conversations with people who don’t come
to the forum, and think about your own be-
havior and things you’ve experienced, and
how we can ultimately be more respectful."

Despite the small turn-out, recent
events and the liveliness of discussion would
indicate that the issue of sexual harassment
and assault is far from closed, and that
Grinnellians are committed to continually
addressing problems related to it.
