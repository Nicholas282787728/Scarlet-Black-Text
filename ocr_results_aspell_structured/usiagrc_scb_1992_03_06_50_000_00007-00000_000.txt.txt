any communication with my student
government“; more often than not
the answer will be a quick “ ”. Of
course,determiningresponsib ty for
this lack of communication is beside
the point, many clearly feel, as if
communication could ever be truly
effective as a one-way process.

I won't speak as to the current
channels for communication in SGA
(though they stillremain substantial).
But I can speak to what I tried last
year (and why some of my attempts
failed). I died to create as many av-
enuesforsludentcommunication and
inputaspossibler Truly working hard
on soliciting student opinion, I felt,
would give me the assurance that I
was never acting to complete a per-
sonal agenda (at least one with which
the students disagreed). Therefore, I
wrote a bi-weekly column in the
Scarlet and Black to give students an
ideaofwhatSGA wasdoing onaday-
to-daybasis;anSGAinteractivecom-
puter “board” was created to provide
informationandtopermitanonymous
criticism and suggestions, in addition
toproviding weekly polls; SGA study
breaks were held (and minimally at-
tended by students); senators were
activelyencouragedtosolicittheopin-
ions of their constituents (and we
even mandated minimal compliance
through a constitutional change to
their job descriptions). An Open
House was held (and attended by two

students); JointBoard meetings were

as always, meetings were open to all
students. I personally held sixteen
office hours each week (though Iwas
only required to post four); Open
Forums were held (again. minimally
attended by students) A point is
reached when it becomes unfair to
criticize SGA for not fully communi-
cating with the students.

I soon lost much of my initial
starryreyedvisionofwhatSGAwould
be like last year, as had my predeces-
sor Rob Killion, and his predecessor
Greg Evans during their termsiall
of us defeated, in one way or another.
by the harsh reality that not all stu-
dents were as interested in student
government as we were (or even as
people such as Mr. Kent arc to this
day). This, in addition to the numbing
effect of numerous menial tasks that
had to be routinely performed (I spent,
on average, well over thirty hours a
week involved with SGA matters—
and this is common to all SGA presir
dents I have personally known),
quickly reminded me that SGA‘s
power is an unpredictable and intan-
gible entity (oftentimes beyond any
students government’s ability to ac—
cess), because the willingness of slua

dents to persuade is unpredictable
and intangible.

So yes, SGA should always be
accountable to the students. But
achieving any of the “real" power
that Mr. Kent alludes to cannot be a
task solelydelegated toSGA (and ifit
is, you forfeit your right to complain
about its lack of success). SGA, for
all practical purposes, is but a tool of
the sludcnlsia tool that is only ef-
fective when properly used, ifused at
all. If the current form of student
governmentisnottoyourliktng,alter
itand work hard archanging it, Ithas
been done in Lhepastand can be done
again. But it wont happen on its own.
and certainly not of its own volition.
If SGA remains substantially the
same, it can only be because the stuv
dents are happy with its current role.

ers, it is also true that, unless GCCS
takes strong and immediate action,
the chain may regenerate more than
three times. Currently, EVAX
struggles an entire week and delivers
between 5,000 and 10,000 messages.
Any prank that has the potential to
generate thousands of messages in
one day is an imminent danger, The
bottom line is that chain letters have
the potential to crash and cmsh the
mail system for days and consume
many hours of staff time that is better
spent helping users.

I want to mention one other facet
of the problem. Grinnell College is a
member of BITNET and the Internet.
Both bodies have policy prohibiting
chain letters orother actions that may
crash or stall the net or attached nodes
on the net. Chain letters that pass
from school to school constitute a

serious danger to networks. The Col-
lege is bound to observe and enforce
“good-use" policies. If we don’t, the
governing bodies will simply ask us
to disconnect our node.

One of my roles as director of the
center is to ensure that computing is
available to all users.That means that
I have to disseminate and enforce
policy.Foratleastthelastthreeyears,
GCCS has 1) handed out the policy
statements that ban chain letters to
every incoming student, 2) had a ses
sion on computing policy and prac-
tice for all new students during New
Student Days, and 3) placed an an-
nouncement about chain letters on
the VAX “welcome mat" for at least
a week,

Since written reminders do not
work we have taken stronger action.

Sincerely,

Bill Francis Director of Computing
