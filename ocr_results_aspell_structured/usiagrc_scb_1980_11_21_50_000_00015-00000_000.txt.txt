olho. in the issue of Oct. 31, displays
amazing misunderstanding of logic
making the unfounded generaliza-
that ”we." the students at Grinnell
a whole, are really only worried
iut how to most effectively "fleece
iety" in order to make a iortune. Oi
in greater salience, however. is the
lay or his naivete: he actually
ms to believe in the notion that

ntiquity (nota bene, Mr. Hushi, in a

vember 2 l, l980

Zenith in the corniields

work called The Nicomachean Ethics,
used logic properly to show that virtue
brings happiness. Yes, virtue. But if
that term seems repulsive, perhaps the
synonomous phrase "an ethical con»
cern and responsibility toward one's
fellow human beings that is put into ac-
tion" will be more acceptable. Isn‘t this

something more lucrative. Eventually,
his dream of helping Hie poor was snuff-
ed out by the demands or a money
oriented society. Babbitt finally
emerges as an object of pity, a victim oi
a society characterized by social
climbers and money grabbers. Greed'
becomes the means oi his survival.

 

. . . a very disconcerting school of thought

seems to be flourishing at Grinnell, a school

of thought which I shall refer to as Babbittism.

 

the very concept which generations oi
Grinnell students have struggled to
assert and maintain? What, for exam~
pic, was the basis of the anti~war
demonstrations or the '60 s, or the an
nual memorials of the Kent State kills
ings, or the continuing efforts to assert
women’s righs?

However. lest i seem too harsh on Mr.
Molho. another look at his prototype,
George Babbitt will perhaps mitigate
some of Molho's guilt. Babbitt, you
remember, as a young m'an, had the
dream of going to law school and taking
the cases of the poor, which obviously

,would not make him rich. But he mare

tied a woman he didn’t love because he
ieared breaking her heart. This forced
him to give up law school and find

Molho exhibits the same greed,
perhaps also caused by the demands oi
society. Perhaps his dream was very
early snuffed out and transformed into
the greed which he admits in his recent
column. Molho, therefore, like Babbitt.
deserves only our pity, for he merely
manirests a small portion of society’s
epidemic avarice, and is not fully
responsible for his actions.

Obviously Babbittism has infected
Molho and. to a lesser extent, iiush.
One wonders why these two are even at
Grinnell if they are so opposed to liberal
arts and knowlege for its own sake
Hopefully, Grinnell will cast off the
burden oi Babbittism before it breeds
any more future parasites of society. —

To the Editor: i am not overly ll1l'
pressed with ﬁle quality oi political
campaigns on the urinnell campus. but
Ileilher do 1 share Bill ' ow ‘s View as
expressed in is letter e suA Circus
comes again ' Maybe campus cani»
palgns do tend to center on “cliches.
iiall promises. slogans. and cartoons,"
but isn't that what political campaign-
ing is all about , associating with your
name something that voters will
remember when the ballots in their
hand! Ever since colonial days. can
didates and campaign managers have
realized the importance oi attentions
gelling devtces. 's type ol’campaigrl-
mg is especially important in today's
society in which individuals are more
concerned w: themselves than with
what's going on around them.

A strictly issue-based campaign

 

Defends SGA campaigning

wuuiu bun-b, because no one would
even notice it. And how does Stowe
want the "real issues at experience and

ability" to be addressed? All of the can- 1 .

didates tell us that they have student
government experience and the
necessary ability. 50 new whatdo we go
on? We're back to the question oi who
appeals to us Who catches and holds
our attention?

what l‘d really like to know is how- 1

SUA is going to lose its "wellrkliown
reputation as a yoke," when someone
who is in it publicly ridicules the "(‘lr-
cus" atmosphere oi the elections?

i agree with the underlying message
in Stowe's article, which is that SGA
should be taken more seriously. but the
iirsl step is to get students interested
and participating in sun. The second is
to get schoolwide support in it.
