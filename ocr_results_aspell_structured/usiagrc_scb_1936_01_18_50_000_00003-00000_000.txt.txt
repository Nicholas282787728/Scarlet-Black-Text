on roots, legs or Wings." It is this
vision oi a unified world which the
,iiiystics have seen, and which he
has embodied in his most recent
poem, “The Song of the Messiah,”
Ldealing with the Indlans' belief
that the Messiah would come to
them.

The poet's lecture was chiotly a
recounting of his epic cycle, with
,the reading at his own poems,
lWheli he spoke, the narrative was
swift and vivid, but his reading
moved more slowly, Although his
,‘enunciatioii was distinct, he read
so slowly that it was difficult to

follow the story. and one could
wish that he would stop less often

to footnote his own words.
