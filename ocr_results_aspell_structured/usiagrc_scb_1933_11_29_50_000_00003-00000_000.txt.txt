The history of Russia from 1900
to 1924 was sketched by Manuel

Russia and the Revolution” at this
week's meeting of the Sunday Eve-
ning club, It was the first of four
lectures on “The Culture of Russia”
which Brown is delivering before the
group.

Starting with the Czarist regime,
the speaker traced the transference
of political power from its breakdown
to the establishment of the present
communistic system under Stalin.

Lenin’s policy Was described by the
speaker as one of compromise with
capitalists, in that he allowed the
capitalists to develop the country
Upon Lenin's death, Brown continued,
there were two aspirants to the posi.
tion of dictator, Trotsky. who favors
world revolution. and Stalin, the ac-
tual successor to the position, who
has continued Lenin's compromise
policy.

Brown’s next lecture will deal with
“The Dictatorship of the Froletar-
iat.".
