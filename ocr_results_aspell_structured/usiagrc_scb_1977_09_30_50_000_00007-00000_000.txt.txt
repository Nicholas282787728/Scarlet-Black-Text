Defense denies

By Chris Sodonra

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
Pioneers evened their season’s
record at 1-1 by Sinking the Beloit
Buccaneers, 2848.

Grinnell opened the scoring
early in the first quarter, after
blocking a Beloit quick kick and a
six-yard TD pass from QB Paul
Crane to Phil Cebuhar. Randy
Reavis kicked the extra point
which gave Grinnell a 7-0 ad-
vantage.

Late in the first quarter, Freshr
man Fred McDougall swiped a
Buccaneer pass and raced 35 yards
for the second Pioneer score.
Reavis kicked the point to stake the
Pioneers to an early 14—0 lead.

Early in the second quarter, the
Buccaneers struck for six points on
a 45-yard swing pass. However,
Beloit failed on its conversion
because of a fine defensive play by
Charlie Gogel, which left the score
14%.

The “Wisconsiners” closed the
scoring gap even further late in the
first hall when the Buccaneers QB
John Weidler tossed an 11-yard TD
pass to Dave Nolden. The Buc»
caneers failed on the conversion,
which gave the “Harvard of the
Midwest" a Slim 1442 lead at the
half.

Midway through the third
quarter. Grinnell carcaptain Bob
Grant snatched a Beloit pass and
returned the ball to the BUCr
caneers‘ 18ryard line. The Pioneers
used five runs to reach paydirt.
with McDougall scoring the TD on
a oneryard plunge. The conversion
kick was blocked, which made the
score 20-12.

on Grinnell’s ilryard line, scored
on QB Weidler's third TD pass of
the afternoon. The two-point
conversion, which would have tied
the score, failed because of a fine
unassisted tackle by Rob Eyre.

Grinnell got some insurance
points early in the fourth quarter,
when McDougal intercepted a
Beloit pass on the Buccaneer's 25
and scampered into the end zone
for his third touchdown of the day.
The PAT was no good, leaving the
score 2643 in favor of the
“Hometowners.”

Late in the game, Grinnell drove
to the Beloit oneyard line where
Reavis. who had replaced Crane
earlier in the last Quarter, was
tripped up on fourth down run to
give Beloit the ball. 0n the next
play, Doug Cummings sacked the
Beloit QB in the endmne for a
safety, which rounded out the
scoring at zero.

The Pioneer’s offense again ran
the ball extremely well, picking up
179 yards on the ground. However,
the passing game has yet to get on
track, as the two QB’s combined on
a five for nine day for only 36 yards
and one interception.

Grinnell’s defense was spec-
tacular against the run. Beloit ran
33 times for only six yards. In the
first two games, Grinnell’s op-
ponents have run a total of 59 times
for only 45 yards. The defensive
secondary also looked strong with
three interceptions.

The Pioneers are looking for
ward to their next contest, against
St. Ambrose, who defeated the U
of Chicago, 13-10, last Saturday.
The next Pioneer home game is
October 8 against Knox.

Women‘s volle ball snatches victor from Simson (H,

Somebody once said, “Tennis is
a funny game; it’s the only game in
which you make love and don‘t
score."

Grinnell College has typically
produced better lovers than
athletes, but Coach Anna Wack's
'77 women’s racquet squad seems
to be of a different breed. In four
dual matches, the stroking
Pioneers have humbled their
opponents, crushing William Penn
10~D in their latest encounter.

New blood has strengthened this
year's team. Four of the top six
spots have been filled by a healthy
infusion of newcomers: Junior
Paula Banchy (number one on the
ladder), Sophomore Sheila
Adenwalla (2}, and freshmen
Susan Despain (3) and LuAnne
Shearer (6), Amy Frieden (4) and

co-captain Mary Hartnett (5) are
old-time Grinnellians‘

In previous matches, the tennis
women have triumphed 10—3 over
Coe. 940 over Cornell, and 8-4 over
Coe. The top five players are un-
defeated in both singles and
doubles play, with the rest of the
team following closely behind.
Recent victors also include Tn‘sh
Fitzgibbons (7). co-captain
Jeanette Mulcachy (8) and Karin
Ford (3).

Much of this year's success can
be attributed to the closeness of the
team. Led by an inspiring coach
and supportive teammates, in
cluding Beth Guynn, Ellen Levim,
Susan Maxwell, Margot Schindler
and Sarah Tecson, the racquet
women hope to continue in their
winning vein.

Continuing success

Obermiller’s fleet sails into third
By Tim DeCoster

In an impressive display of
talent and depth, Grinnell's cross
country team took third place in
the 13rteam Les Duke Invitational
last Saturday, defeating four
conference rivals in the process.
The meet was dominated by
defending champ Luther College,
which took the first five places.

Luther's Paul Mullen won the
iour»mile race with a time of
20:41.7, nearly a minute worse than
last year‘s course record of 19:52,
also set by a Luther runner That
time difference reflected the poor
field conditions of this year's meet.
After Friday's rains, the course
was soft and sloppx resulting in
poorer times than might have been
expected.

Terry Drew was the first Pioneer
to finish, crossing the line in eighth
place with a time of 21:39. Tim
DeCoster Covered the distance in a
personal-best 22:13, good for 16th

Today Grinnell travels to Mt.

Seven individual races will be run
as each teams‘ number one run

followed by a race for number two
runners, and so forth Each

teams expected at today‘s meet

optimistic about hls team’s

 

prospects for success.

Win or Lose

Many a sports fan attends a
sporting event solely to witness his
favorite team attain victory. Such
a fan finds great disappointment
when attending most Grinnell
College athletic contests. Or does
he?

This fall it appears that a new
era in women‘s athletics has
arrived. As of this moment. all
three Grinnell women's sports
teams hold winning records. Field
hockey (1-1-1), tennis (470), and
volleyball (6-2) have received
acclaim from everyone, including
the worst Gn'rlnell skeptics.

Who or what in the athletic
department has brought about
such a phenomenon? No one truly
knows but there are many people
willing to voice their suggestions.

One field hockey player at-
tributes much of the team’s suc-
cess to Coach Winkler’s drilling.
She says. “The coach knows what
it takes to win and it takes en-
durance, I have played on many
teams in my day and the majority
of our (expletive deleted) losses
occured solely because we weren’t
in real good shape."

A volley ball player couldn't
come up with a concrete answer
but did note that their success has
been of no surprise to anyone on
the team.

The tennis team has astonished
everyone. Already they have won
twice as many matches as last
year’s Squad; . One enthused
tennis player said, “Heck
I don't know why we keep on
winning: but at this rate we are
going to be contenders for the state
title.”

Now, many cynics agree that
Grinnell women's athletics
deserve praise, but on the other
hand they definately don’t believe
that women’s tennis will attend the
state championships.

Perhaps these pessimistically-
minded people have lost faith in
Grinnell athletics because they
cannot escape their memories of
previous Grinnell athletic failures.
Or maybe these people know what
they are talking about and deserve
commendation for their insight.

However, these Cynics and their
opinions should be ignored, Suc-
cess does not hold great bearing
with Grinnell' College athletics. Or
at least as long as John Pfitsch
remains head of the athletic
department, instead pleasure,
personal accomplishment and
team membership are emphasized
in Grinnell athletics. And as one
volleyball player simply stated,
Grinnell women’s athletics have
succeeded merely beacuse, “they
(the women) are good."

If’s coming
soon.
