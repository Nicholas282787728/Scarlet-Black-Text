This year,
in the history of the project, junn
iors and sophomores have been

for this, according to John. w.

mainder of their college career.

SEVEN” YEARS OF PROGRESS

in this Acdition. the Sam-let and Black celebrates ’70 years of
loul'nalism at Grinnell, Ill these 70 years there has been an
unbroken effort to maintain this newspaper as an organ of
democracy. '

All e. nmination of editorials and news stories from the
i s has shown that, since 1869, Grinncll journalism has
made d slncore effort to do the following things: (1) To
maintain a strict regard for truth; (2) To give all the
news that space can allow; (3) To maintain an uncensored
press, lino *ing that the greatest good can come from a
free exchange of ideasi (4) To stand by its duty of never
succumbing to subversive influences; (:3) To be ever ready
to cl'itlclzo with a view to reform; (6) Never to use editorial
columns for criticism unless it believes in the fundamental
goodness and worth of Grinnell; (7) Never to assume the
posltlon of greatest responsibility on this newspaper unless
the chosen loader is ever willing and able to stand by his
co'nlctlons and express them editorially; (8) To make the
attitude of the editorial columns alive, 5 objective, looking
f01'\‘»:«\1tl to a Greater Grillncll; (5)) To build the strength
and respect of the campus paper, always making it the
leader of the college public: (10) To maintain the effort
cl always representing and encouraging the growing in-
‘tert‘sts of the college.

Frncdom of the press is a recognized principle of Ameri»
can democracy. but even today there is doubt as to how
long ll. will last. Even today there is suppression! The above
Cannons must be followed if the Scarlet and Black is to
in tﬂlh its place at Gl‘lllllell college, not only to Serve in
the intercsts cf the campus alone, but to keep alive here a
free. intelligent and unbi sed press, the stronghold of demo-

cl cy, 21nd,, ill our particular case, the stronghold of a
Greater Grlnncll!

Looking back over the years, the
Scarlet and Black With this issue
celebrates 70 years of journalism
at Grinnell college,

Led by an energetic group of
students, interested in furthering
college journalism west of the
Mississippi river, Iowa college
pioneered in 1869 with posted
news lettersatne first to appear
in the West.

Two years later The News Let-
ter first appeared in the columns
of the Crinnell Herald on August
23, 1371 where it gained in popu-
larity until 1873 when the faculty
gave permission to publish The
News Letter as a separate paper.
In July of that year the New
Series No. 1 was issued and con-
tinued for seven years as a

 

monthly publication.

In Feb, 1889, The Pulse, pub~
Iished “fortnightly," first appear—
ed, and in September of that year
The NEWS Letter became a bi-
weekly. During 1889-90, Iowa col-
lege had the benefit of a Wekly
paper. as the two journals were
issued on alternate Saturdays.

The divided efforts of the two
papers having proved almost fin-
ancially disastrous to both pub<
lications, The Pulse and The News
Letter were combined in The
Unit, the name being chosen to in-
dicate the union of the two pa-
pers. The Unit published bi-
weekly until 1894 when students
conceived the idea of a semi-
weekly newspaper.

In Sept., 1894. The Unit chang-

ied its name to the Scarlet and
Black to conform with the col-
lege colors. The change to a
semi-weekly publication, togeth—
er with the change in name, how-
ever, caused the staff to split
with the result that the with-
drawing members continued to
publish The Unit as a literary
journal. The Unit published as a
literary magazine until 1911 when
it ceased publication through {in-
ancial difficulties, leaving only
the Scarlet and Black as the ore
ficial campus publication.

1n the meantime, in 1909, the
name Grinnell college was offi-
cially adopted by the board of
trustees. and at the same time
the college’s newspaper became
the orinnell Scarlet and Black.
