GRINNELL COMPLETES ITS ENDOWMENT DRIVE SUCCESSFULLY

Billiken Team
to 26-19 Score

Offense of... Both Teams Is
Smooth, With St. Louis
Having Edge.

Murray Again Stars

Pioneers Look Much Better Than
Against Minnesota, Who Win

by Score of 30-15.

Five blueclad Billikens. con-
querors of Vanderbilt, victors over
Nebraska, touted as the pride of st.
Louis, escaped being humbled by the
Grinnell college cagers here Monday
night only by a margin of 26 to 19.
But that doesn’t tell half of the story
of the scare meted out to those five
hard passing invaders by the Pioneers
—for with less than two minutes to
play St. Louis university was leading
-by only a 21 to 19 margin.

The veteran visiting quintet, with
Strong's dead eye for the netting
leading the way and the blond Hunt
playing a flashy game at guard,
were superior to Crihnell in their
handling of theball. Both teams us-
ed a slow breaking offense that
meant periods of continued passing
without a shot.

Drury opened the scoring for St.
Louis with the tip~o£f and Strong's
two gift shots enlarged the lead.
Edmans, Douglas and Wilhelm
counted, however, and the Grinnell»
inns led temporarily, 5 to 4. At half
time, the local hopefuls were trailing
by a 10 to 7 count. ‘

Finish Is Close

The second half saw Grinnell fight-
‘ing continually to evetcome that lead.
The Billikens made it 13 to a but the
fighting Pioneers pulled up and with
two minutes to go were trailing, 19
to 17. Strong registered but Mur-

\ ray matched in with a long heave.
Strong and Drury then clicked in the
final minute of play to ring up a re-
spectable margin.

Strong's 14 points made him eas-
ily the outstanding man on the floor
while Murray and Douglas shared
Grinnell honors. Murray was the
big cog of the Grinnell spurt in the
final minutes with two long baskets
and one short shot when he dribbled
between the St. Louis guards.

A rather wobbly Grinnell basketball
team tank the short end of B. 30-15
count in their game with Minnesota
University which was played in Min-
neapolis last Saturday. It was very
evident from the start that Minnesota
outplayed the Pioneer ﬁve, but Grin-
nell's greatest difficulty seemed to be
in being unable to adapt themselves
to a decidedly new style of attack,

anything very brilliant, played con—

Cornstalks, Pygmies, Odd Animals
Interest Profs; at Science Meeting

 

”What impressed me most," Prof.
J. D. Stoops told the inquiring re.
porter with regard to the Des Moines
meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, dur-
ing the holidays, “was the tremend-
ous new interest in anthropology.
Of course 1 may be wrong’ in my
choice, but that was what interested
me.

“A man read a paper about a study
of pygmies,” Mr. Stoops went on.
"We actually see in the pygmies peo-
ple living in the stone age. They live
in New Guinea; and the Papuans
who serve as guides, right alongside
of the pygmies, use iron and steel
implements."

Corr-stalks for Energy

Professor Sherman, when question-
ed, mentioned as especially inter.
csting a symposium at Ames on the
uses of cornstalks. There is there
an exhibition plant by which the
cornstalks from forty acres of land
might yield heat, light, and power for
a farm and be used afterwards for
cornstalk paper. Insulating board.
dyes and perfumes are also produced

with which an insulator like bake—
llte can be made.

Dr. Norris was much interested in
the experiments of Dr. Witchi, "He’s
a regular wizard at grafting ani-
Innis," he commented. He grafts
animals by combining their eggs. He
had a double salamander, with eight
legs, so that the neck of one was
hooked onto the tail of the other.
The front one had to do the eating
for boLh. There was not doubt of its
being alive."

“The trend is to interpret the atom
in terms of wave mechanics instead
of a solar System," Professor Almy
told the reporter, "and everything of
interest had a bearing on that field."
Mr. Almy also mentioned the award-
ing of the association's annual one
thousand dollar prize to Professor
Arthur Dcmpster of Chicago univer-
sity.

Library Closes Stacks
t for Remaindér-pf Year

A new system for loaning library
1301le has been inaugurated in the
library and will be continued through
out the remainder of the school year
according to an announcement made
in the library bulletin for this month.

The stack rooms will be closed to
students. Faculty members and
members of the library staff only
will be allowed in the stacks. ooks
may be taken by calling for them at
the desk or from one of the assist-
any

,This step was taken in response to
requests of students and faculty be~
cause of the loss of books and the
temporary disappearance of books
assigned for class work.

The system of closed stack rooms
is being used at many colleges and
universities throughout the country.
The system has been practical in re-
ducing the loss of books in most cas-
cs.

,ln order that the students may
have access to books for recreational
reading, the librarian is planning to
place a collection of the more popu-
lar books on shelves in the first
floor reading room at some time in
the future.

Dorm Basketeers
Clash on Saturday

Saturday Will see a renewal of Inter-
dorm rivalry when all twelve teams
will be thrown into action in the ﬁrst
day's play of the intramural basket-
ball series. Building Five, while far
from a. safe bet, seems to he the fav-
orite While Dibble and Building Four
should put up some very stiff opposi-
tion. Clark hall won the champion-
ship last year. Although never very
conspicuous in the athletic world,
Smith hall should be heard from and
might even be considered the “dark
horse" of the outﬁt.

The following captains have been
elected: Smith hall, Louis Path; Lan-
guh, John Kent: Building Three,
Charles Woody; Building Four, Bob
Ferguson: Clark, Eli Liedtke; Dibble,
Meredith Heldrldge and Patsy Far-

College Needs Only to Collect
Pledges (E $400,000 by April 1

to Get Gift

‘Not One Cent for Buildings,
But Goes to Strengthen
School'—Main.

“Not one cent of the money made
available to Crlnnell through the en-
dowment drive brought to a success-
ful conclusion lestweek will go to-
ward tne construction of buildings,"
stated President J. H, T. Mom in an
interview this morning, thus correct—
ing a widespread belief among the
student body that the success of the
college in the campaign just ﬁnished
would mean the construction of one
or more buildings in the near future
out of the funds obtained in the driva

"What Grinnell’s success in the
campaign does mean," said President
Main, .. is that the college will be
enabled to maintain a secure ﬁnancial
foundation, will be enabled to work
on a balanced budget, maintain its
teaching staff and not only maintain
it, but strengthen it. Yet because
this campaign has enabled the coir
lege to pay off its debts and will add
$1,500,000 to our permanent endow-
ment. Grinnell has for the future the
right of way on the open road for the
construction of the various buildings
which we surely need."

Pledges nue April 1

Strong emphasis was placed by
President Main on the fact that the
gift of the General Education board
of $500,000 is still a conditional one
until all the pledges made in the res
cent endowment drive are collected
and pointed out that while probably
the most serious obstacle to success
in the endowment drive . has' been
overcome by meeting the time limit
for pledges and raising $400,000 in
the past three months. yet the dual
rejoicing of all those interested in
Grinnell’s future must be deferred
until after April 1. which is the time
limit given by the General Education
board for collecting all the pledges.

Hopes for Future Building

"Of course we must have develop-
ment in buildings and equipment,"
the president pointed out. "There is
my ideal for the Grinnell of the fu
ture," be said, pointing to an archi
tect's drawing on the wall of his of.
fice of the Crinnell campus as it will
look when all the building projects
are completed that are planned ofr
the future. “There is to be develop-
ment in laboratory equipmentiwe

arts group cf buildings. there is to be
constructed an adequate ﬁeldhouse

Main Announces
Public-Relations
Policy for School

The adoption by Crinnell college
of a publlerelations policy involving
ﬁeld representation and extension
lecturing was announced here recent-
ly by Pres. J. H. T. Main. At least
two representatives of the college will
be available as speakers for clubs,
churches, and high schools in Iowa
and adjoining states.

President Main announced that
Miss Gretchen Steiner had been ap.
pointed as one of these representa—
tives and would begin work January
1. Miss Steiner will lecture on dram—
atic art. the contemporary theater,
and modern stagecraft. She is a
graduate of Crinnell college, and has
studied the drama under Prof. George
Pierce Baker of role university. She
is experienced as an actress, and for
several years she directed the calm
munity theater of Niagara Falls.
New York.

Another extension lecturer, this
one a man, will be appointed soon.

of Half Million

Meets Terms of Education
Board; Raises $1,600,000
Since 1921.

With gifts and pledges on hand
totaling nearly four hundred thou-
sand dollcrs, received within the past
three months, Crinncll college com-
pleted on Dec. 31 the greatest endow-
ment campaign in its history, a cam-
paign which began in 1921 and which
involved the raising of approximate-
ly $1,600,000 on the part ,of the col-
lege. By doing so. Crinnell made
practically certain a conditional gift
of $500,000 from the General Educa-
tion board and faces 1930 with only
the necessity of collecting all out<
standing pledges by April 1 in order
to make this half million dollar gift
a certainty.

Main Due Credit

Announcement of success in the
campaign was made last week by
President J. H. T. Main. and was re-
ceived with widespread rejoicing on
the part of Crinnell alumni, friends'
and students everywhere. A large
share of President Main‘s time in the
past few years has been given to this
project and much credit for the suc-
cess of the endowment drive is given
to him.

The conditions under which Grin-
nell raised the 51,600,000 have been
anything but favorable. It was in
the face of one of the most disastrous
financial depressions in the history of
Iowa and of the country at large that
the college set out on the drive nine
years ago To the college, the Gen
eral Educlltion board made a'pledge
of $500,000 atthat time, on the con—
dition that Grinnell should raise one
million dollars for if: permanent en-
dowment and wipe out the debt of
approximately $600,000 which had
arisen out of the construction of var-
ious buildings on the campus and out
of other projects necessary to the
carrying on of a college. Grinnell
was given until Dec. 31‘ of the year
just ﬁnished to obtain the necessary
sum in pledges and until April 1 of
this year to collect such pledges.

Campaign Intensive

By November of last year, the
amount received approximated 51,-
220,000, leaving $930,000 yet to raise
and it was during the last months of
1929 that the most intensive financial
campaign the college has known was
carried on. During that time gifts
came in from approximately eight
hundred sources, including gifts from
750 of alumni, besides those from
trustees, friends of Crinnellandagift
of $50,000 from the Congregational
Foundation for Education. Donors
who gave ten thousand dollars or
more include: Arthur Curtis James
of New York; E. P. Clark of Los
Angeles, whose grandfather was a
pioneer s'cttier in Grinnell; the Alden
trust of Worcester, Mass; and Thom-
as w. Lamont, of Morgan and Com-
pany of New York.

Must Collect Pledges

President Main points out that
while the success of the college in
raising such a large sum is worthy
of much praise, there yet remains one
