Ourlicht prints on displa
in Burling

Prints by Laurie Ourlicht, artist-in-
residence at Grinnell College, will be on
exhibit March 30 a April 23 in Burling
Gallery on the lower level at Burling
Library,

Ourlicht describes her work in etching
and lithography as attempting to capture
the ilavor and sound other environment in
New York City. “I started out with images
of women, especially women or color and
old women They weren't necessarily
beautiful, but had a certain strength to
them.“ Ourlicht obtains much of her in-
spiratlon irom riding the subway and
observing the iaces oi the people and the
ways they sit or move.

Ourlicht's exhibition includes a series on
Carnival. a Caribbean iestival held in New

York City. The tradition dates back to pre-
Christian times and has both pagan and
Catholic elements in its ritual.

“My art now is starting to take a more
personal direction,” says Ourlichti “I am
trying to go deeper inside or me and draw
upon some personal experiences, so my
work has changed a lot."

Ourlicht’s residency at Grinnell is spon»
sored by the Black Scholars in Residence
Program, Office of Minority Affairs. While
on campus, she will teach a four-week ses
sion on lithography and etching to Robert
McKlbbin‘s printmaking classes.

There will be a public reception to greet
the artist on Monday, April 13 at 4:15 p.m.
in Burling Gallery, The gallery is open
during regular library hours,

Rhoads and Caccamo
concert tomorrow

by Ali Elsaliar ,

They act like exjocks doing a Lite beer
commercial, Chris Rhoads says their
mustc is “honest and sensuive ” Jim Cac-
camo blusters at this comment, insisting
that their musxc is “Sensitive and honest "
The two will argue the point, grow tired oi
it, but still never agree, And that is good
news because, the [act is, their silly
disagreements belie even sillier perr
sonalities, and make tor a great combina-
tion of music.

It's true, after years oi speculation,
months of negotiations, days of decisions,
and literally minutes oi planning, Jim Cac-
camo, the “Italian Stallion,” and Chris
Rhoads, “Mr, Christopher,” will appear
together, live and in concert, tomorrow,
Saturday, April 11 at 8:00 pm. in South
Lounge. The concert is sponsored by Chris
tian Fellowship.

The concert will mark Mr. Christopher’s
second full-Scale Concert on the Grinnell

h it will be his first ap

pearance with a stallion it you missed his
last concert, you'll want to be sure not to
miss this one. And it you thought the last
one was good, this one promises to be even
better, This is because the addition of The
Stallion means greater variety Will be
possible. it there was a complaint about
the last concert, it was that the music was
not sufficiently varied in mood or style.
But the added instruments and animals
should make for a chorus of new, varied,
and beautiful sounds, There Will be loud
music, soft music, happy music, sad
music, silly music, and almost every other
kind of mustC.

it you are interested in a meaningful ex-
perience. be at South Lounge tomorrow
night. it you are interested in an auditory
experience, be there. Even it you are in
terested in a visual experience, be there,
[or ii the music gets boring, you will still
have Chris Rhoads' clothes to look at, and
.iim Caccamo's height to wonder about.
