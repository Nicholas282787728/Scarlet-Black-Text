No more will Coach William U. MC-
Almon develop Championship football
teams for Gl'innell. The man who has
been the backbone of two strenuous
football seasons handed in his resig-
nation to the Board of Athletic Con—
trol last evening.

Your Health Is Clulse.

Poor health is given as the cause
tor the resignation. It has been well
known locally that a football season
has. proved too strenuous for the
Coach. A year ago he came to G in»
hell in the best of health, but within
the space of but a couple oi months
he was reduced much in flesh, and had
to remain constantly under a doctor's
care.

Wits Not. Expected To Li 0,.

After the season last year the Coach
spent some time consulting specialists
in an ellort to get relief and at Chi-i. t-
mas time he went to a Chicago hospi-
tal, where physicians stated that he
had only a couple of weeks longer to
live. Somehow or other he grew bet-
ter and in January went to California.
where tic remained till spring. Until
this fall he was practicing law in Mine
neopolis, where he has established a
permanent r -idcncc.

This fall when Coach MCAlmon came
to Griiinell ho was in good health
again, but gradually he has grown
worse. liis condition, as well as the
advice of scvcral close fricnds, havc
brought him to a decision to gil'e up
football coaching and rctirc to a loss

the Coach had nothing but good words
to say of his trcotment in Gl'inllcll.
”I nct-or have found niccr people," he
said, "tlllul therc arc in druiucll. lav-

said. Oh yes, tlicy siire arc nice pear

know I have been talking to some of

best thing to do.”

The Coach is as yet undecided as to
what he will do. He was positit
however, in his dccision to go some»
whcrc for a low it ecli and take a coin
plete rest. Later he will continuc h
duties in Minneapolis, whcrc he has a
quite prosperous law practice.

Members of the Board statcd last
night that the Coach's resignation

A cartoonist has been permanently

Such was the result of an clcction held
m the Library Monday afternoon when
Leslie i lilos, '20, was elected to the
DOSILIOII.

Miles’ cartoons which have appeared
in the paper so far this year, have at
tractcd iiilich attention. They have
shown a ﬁnish that has been far above
that of the usual college cartoonist.
In them has been indicated a certain
amount of true ability and his election
to the staff will assure a more or less
regular cartoon ser ‘ce for readers of
The Scarlet and Black.

Miles is a man of some training in
his line. He has studied for two years
under Mr. \V. L. Email, it. hated Car-

for some time with the Cleveland
Leader, and for many years he drew
cartoons constantly for the Review of

Grinncll holds much respect for the
fast Cornell team, which plays hero
for thc lowa Conference championship
Friday afternoon. A lay-oft of three
weeks has seriously hampered the 104
cal elevcn, while a hard game with‘
Coe last week has given Cornell’s
fighting spirit a keen edge. .

With only two outdoor practices last
woek, the squad has lost some of its
cfliciency. Especially is this true in
handling forward passes. This wccls
Coach McAlnmn is holding daily scrim—
magcs against the Freshmen, and he
hopes in this way to rebuild his team
to full fighting form.

Cornell To Be Feared.

Corncll, on the other hand, has been
playing consistent ball all year. They,
have dcfcatcd all thcir conference on<
poncnts in an easy manner. Last
week they won dcci 'vely from One,
while a low weeks earlier the Grinncll
squad was forced to play the limit in
order to snatch a‘ victory train the
Crimson and Gold. Thc Methodist
team has been pointed toward the
contest Friday ever since the season
coinincnccd. Coach Finger early rec<
ognizcd the strongth of the scarlet
and black aggregation, and has l'ounlL
ed his team into the best condition
they hate enjoyed yet this fall.
