Soccer: Seeking the title

by Rob Brooks
Tomorrow at 1:30 pm. on Ward Field,
the Grinnell soccer team goes for their
lirstever Midwest Conference title
against defending champion Lake
Forest College.

The Grinnell ollense will be led by
Doug Rowe. He scored 13 goals this
season, tying the record he set last
year. “He is one of the finest offensive
players l've ever seen," said Plitseh.

Despite the loss of fullfback David
Morote, the Pioneer defense was strong
all season. The team gave up only two
goals in {our games of Southern Divi-
sion competition.

The Pioneers made it to the cham-
pionship game by defeating, among
others. nine~time Southern Division
champ Knox College. They beat that
team 3’1, ending the Siwasher‘s five-
game reign over Grinnell.

Lake Forest, on lhe other hand,
dereated Carleton 2-1 in overtime,
marking the first time the Carls had
been scored upon in ,diVlsion play this
year.

The teams come into the game with
identical «HJ records. They also have
two common opponents between them.
the Pioneeers tied Carleton 2'2 and lost
to Colorado College on. Lake Forest
beat Carleton 2»! and beat Colorado 1-0.

According to Grinnell coach John
Pfitsch, the Foresters are a quick team.
“They have an extremely quick front
line, But they don't run and shoot. They
are a control team that utilizes the
short pass well,” said Plitsch.

Pﬁtsch calls this year’s Pioneers
squad “the best I’ve had in six years of
coaching." He cited the maturity of the
team and attributed the success to the
team's hard work and poise Ulroughout
the season.
