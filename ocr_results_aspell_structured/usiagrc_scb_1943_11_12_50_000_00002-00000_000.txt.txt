Editorial - -

The iollowing editorial by Jim zebel is reprinted
from a. recent issue of “THE DAILY [0\VAN,"
student organ at the University of Iowa. it is
the ieeling of the editorial board of “The Scarlet
and Buick" that the points made therein may be
of some interest and value to the students, filer
ulty, and administrative officers oi ‘Grinnell Cole
lege at this time.

For some years now (ever sillce about
1847) the university has been trying _to
find a way to cope with various social
problems connected with undergraduate
life . . .

Drinking has always been tlle main and
perennial bogey . . .

Although, so for m: I can see, it [iris liez
bccn its bad at some local reformist: llll'L‘L‘ Irlcd

in years past . . . and today llir (Ii-yr m'c mice
again on the mare/I . . .

Since these attempts are invariably
negative (civic pressure to close taverns,
etc.) they have met with little or no sucr
cess . . . like prohibition, they have served
only to aggravate the problem and entreilch
it more deeply.

The whole question, as I see it, is not
how to stamp out drinking, for that is an
impossible, unattainable and childish goal;
the question is rather how to control and
channel it properly.

This cannot be done by the Ames
strangulation method, which consists of
closing things up tighter than a drum . . .
for it merely submerges the problem or
shoves it off on another town nearby.

Troyer Anderson said in an editorial on
this page last spring that one of the great
est troubles with midwestern college edur
cation is that there exists an almost g‘
gantic breach between students and face
ulty. . .

What better w v could this camaraderie

be encouraged than through the medium’

of a faculty-student social club, based on
much the same idea as those at Oxford
and a few eastern colleges?

And if drinks were available, it is a
safe bet that they would be consumed \\itll

By limiting the student side of the
club to only those upperclassmcn with high'
grades, and those who had become campus
leaders, there would be aroused in every
intelligent and \l'orthwhilc male student a
strong desire to place himself in this
group . . . and perhaps arrangements could
be made to permit women students with
outstanding records. to attend also.
