Readers Criticizo
Editor’s Elitism

To the editor:

In response to the new arts
editor's call tor thoughts and ideas,
we would like to make a iew com»
ments concerning the arts page as
it appeared on January 29, while it
is not our intention to deny com-
pletely Mr Prosser's editorial
capabilities, we do ieel that his
prose style evidences a certain
elitism that is entirely map~
propriate, His movie reviews are
amateurish strings oi jargon that
reek oi Slskel and Ebert reruns
Using technical cinematic
vocabulary. Mr. Prosser artiully
transtorms his opinions into tact.
For example, his review oi “1934"
may or may not exhibit these
defaults: yet the adjective clause
preceding his name demonstrates
Mr Prosser's assurance that this
is tact rather than opinion, We do
not think even Mr, Prosser can
deny that, in the linal analysis, a
movie review is but an opinion
Thus. it is his duty to the readers oi
the Scarlet and Black to remain
within that realm.

We also do not ieei that cheap
imitations at James Joyce's
stream oi consciousness are in the
best interests otts and B readers.
Mr. Prosscr's review oi "Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs”
mocks what, by all rights, should
be a straightiorward review iii a
classic iilm. His point lii he has
one) remains elusive, and the en-
tire second paragraph iorces us to
endure Mr. Prosser's dense.
twisted meanderings which, unlors
tunateiy, are completely tangen-
tial to “Snow White” itseli, These
are serious ilaws. Mr, Prosser's
jargon is no more than "lush crallr
smanship,“ which “seems heavys
handed on such a simple core." as
he himselt remarked about

"Sophie’s Choice '*

Finally, we also wish to take
strong exception to Mr. Prosser's
assertion in “Grinnell. the Arts,
alid YOU" that “the best. most
worthy, part or a liberal education
is so otten equated with the arts."
This is simply not true. No one

aspect oi a liberal education should
overshadow another. by the very
delinltion oi a “liberal education."
We hope, ior Mr, Prosser‘s sake.
that he is not as narruwsminded as
his statement leads us to believe.

informed or not.
We should Vote

To the editor:

Yes, caucus time approaches
and the air is iilled with political
tension Untortunately. it rubs oil
more on some or us than others.

Steve Hingten made a valid point
last week when he noted the
relative ignorance or Grinnellians
regarding the upcoming presiden-
tial caucuses, it is certain that
students, on the average. are not
as iniormed about political issues
as perhaps they should be The pro-
blem with Mr. Hingten's argument
is that he wishes to place himseli
above all ‘polltlcal ignorants' by
excluding the latter irom the
political process Now quite [rank-
ly. I‘M tired ot talking to people
(like Steve) who constantly want ll)
drill me on the economic policies oi
Dukakis or on the Dole plan. in an
attempt to show their superiority
to me simply because they've read
more articles than i have. l am not
the best-iniormed student. but I
know more than many. and i sure
as hell intend to caucus next week

Don't get me wrong. I applaud
cteve ior caring enough to learn
about the candidates. and I wish
there were more people like him
Hell, I wish i had the time to read
everything he's read It's just that

(uses us-ooo)

it‘s rather annoying that he places
himseli on such a pedestal. and it
also rather deieats the purpose oi

posedly practices I can picture

ment. though. was intended to be
or. by. and ipr ALL people. mean
ing that we all have a say in its
composition, regardless oi our in
telligence or ignorance. Don't
worry though. Sieve. because
despite individual ignorance. the
population as a whole generally
has good judgment. or so I learned
in my Statistics class, (Yeah. 50 We
elected Reagan Iche 7 but
USUALLY that principle holds
true.) So here's my suggestion to
all: Do some reading and learn
about the candidates so that you
might make a more iniormed
choice, but even it you don't. get
out there and participate in the
election process. it's perhaps our
most important right. and even the
political knownivalls can'l take it
away irom us — Thomas A. Beverly

To the Editor:

Finally. somebody has realized
that the ruling does not advocate
censorship. The same people
screaming "censor" now are the
same people who called Governor
Wallace a racist and President
Nixon a crook. President Reagan,
Attorney General Meese. Justice
Scalia,and Senator Gore Join me in
reiterating that the court was
merely protecting the rights or the
parents not to have their children
exposed to potentially liarmiul
materials and that, again, in no
way do we advocate censorship.
We eagerly await your prescnnlra.

Dear Editor:
when 1 returned to my carrel on
the first ﬂoor of Burling after lunch
last Tuesday morning. l round a
note scrawled in loopy handwriting
with cutesy underlinings. it said:
“I lind it rude and maddening that
you would leave 3 Carol ‘occupied’
and yet unused like this ior almost
two hoursll For those at us who
are actually here [underlined
twice] and studying [underlined
twice]. it is uniair to occupy unus-
ed space. Please be more cone
siderate." HMMMlilMMM. First
of all, I [eel a need to explain [hail

was instead darting to and irom
library in the process oi
i‘ ’shing' up some applications and
declaring my major Obviously my
spy who had timed me so well was

unable to recognize my several aps
pearanccs to revise essays and till
out forms.

The anonymity oi the note tur-
tl‘ier irustrated me. After all, if one
is going to be sell-righteous and
preachy. then one should at least
sign one‘s name and take credit {or

Finally, 1 would like to thank this
person ior caring enough about me
to want to help me with my seliish

had not been warned until my
senior yiear. There is no telling how
out or control 1 might have
become, maybe even to the point oi
not taking my books with me when
i go downstairs to the bathroom. 7

On Second

The incidents which led me to
write this column were especially
disturbing to me because they
were so radically ditterent irom
the contacts 1 have had with
members oi the Christian

I was told last spring that l was

prickcd up my ears. There were no
two ways abouti I had a one-way
ticket to the big hot spot it I didn‘t
shape up and admit Jesus Christ
into my life. The iunny thing was,
as a christian, 1 had thought that
this little detail had already been
taken care of, But alas; I was
mistaken. I hadn't been born

again.

I have been told that to be born
again is a grace-tilled experience,
something that proioundly clients

Anyway, back to my story i was

mine who was passing through sat
down beside me to chat for a while,

small talk (the weather. the nature
