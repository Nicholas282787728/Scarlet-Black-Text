SCARLET AND BLACK

Friday. October 20, l95l

 

Pioneers Bow to Lawrence

Disrcgard the score
statistically the Pioneers should
have won the game. but unfor.
tunutely the scores what counts,
and here Lawrence reigned su-
preme, dropping the scarlet
and Black 34-6.

Grinnell racked up 23 first
downs to the Vikings 13, collec.
ted 230 yards rushing and com.
pleted 50% of its passes for as
yards, but still lost the game.

An answer to the wide dis—
parity between the score and

the rest oi the statistics can
be found in the regulars who

didn't play. The Pioneers
were severely handicapped by
the loss of Paul Phillips,’ the
key man on defense as well
as the quarterback, George

Whitehill, the key man on

otteuse who played only the

first quarter and had to be
removed because oi a broken
nose.

Add to this list Eigelow, last
year’s second team all confer—
ence tackle who never even

made the trip; Gregg, all confer-i

ence honorable mention at the

tackle post who played only two .

minutes plus Slocum, Ellis,
Blough, and Alf Johnsen who
played only a small part of the
game; and you can see why the
Scarlet and Black looked so bad
'at times, particularly on defense.

Lawrence scored first, iol-
lowetl by a Grinnell march to
the nine yard line where the
Pioneer attack faulted. Law—
rence took over on downs,
Grinnell held, and this time
went all the way They covered
ninetyrone yards on eight first
downs as Reimel's hit pay dirt,
-, He started irom the one on a
" quarterback sneak tor the
' Scarlet and Black”: only tally
or the day, The Pioneers
threatened repeatedly all or
ternoon, but never quite made
it again.

Lawrence scored twice agaiﬂl
before the half ended, once on
one of Grinnell's two fumbles
which the Vikes recovered on
the Pioneer l9 yard line to con.
vert into a touchdown a few
plays later. .

Lawrence scored once more in
the third period on a SBryard
dash by Bigford and again in
the fourth quarter, Hess carried
59 yards to the Pioneer’s 22
where Shield's pass to SpangEn»
burg was good for the Blue and
Whites last touchdown.

Kingery had his best after-
noon of the yet infant season,
garnering 117 yards in 22 tries.
Miller picked up 74 more while
John McClintock boasted the
team's bcst rushing average,
clipping off a very respectable
seven yards a try,
