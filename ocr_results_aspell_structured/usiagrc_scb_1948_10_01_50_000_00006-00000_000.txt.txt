‘sehool or college before the end of
the period for which tuition has
to be paid must refund the tuition
that Veterans Administration must
pay for the time he did not at
tend, or lose the training time
covered by these payments.

, Affected are all those veterans
‘cnrolling under the G71 Bill in in
stitutious that (1) collect thei
,tuition and other charges in ads
vance, and (2) limit refunds of
tuition charges that can be made
to any student, veteran or none
veteran, discontinuing his work
before the end of the term or see
mestcr.

Tho Grinncli policy states that
any student who voluntarily ivitli-
draws from college will he held
for tuition in accordance with the
following schedule:

week, onersixth; during the third

or fourth week, one-third; dur-

ing the fifth to eighth week,
two.thirds; and thermter, no
tuition refund.

VA's ruling holds the veteran
legally responsible for tuition pay-
ments that VA must make to these
schools for the instruction periods
the Veterans do not attend.

or semester if a student remains
in school after the refund period
is over. As a result, any student
who drops out loses that much of
his tuition payment.

Since no refunds to VA for vet~
crans dropping out of school after
that time are possible, the veter-
an must refund the balance of the
tuition paid for him.

Veterans who do not want to
refund the payment to VA will
rinse the training time covered by
what payment.

1 When studentrvetel'ans have to
interrupt their course before VA
is obligated to pay tuition for the
full period, VA will pay the in~
stitutions only the normal charges
for the time the veterans attended.

In the latter case, the Vetemns’
entitlement will be reduced only
by the length of’ their attendance
for which the institution will be
paid, VA said.

quest of a score but to no avail.
The kicking was handled by EG
Booth and Hooks, the former
getting off one or two to good
advantage.

Defensively, the standouts for
Griiiiiell were “Rass” Norvet,
Mel White, EG Booth, Del Eg-
gcrs, and Bill Hooks. A chalk
talk Sunday afternoon discussed
the game from a critical stande
point to bring out and correct
the errors made against Law»
rence. But last Saturday the
Vikings, whose big, rugged line
and hdrdrrunnmg hacks made
the most of a few errors, at-
tained an early lead and were
