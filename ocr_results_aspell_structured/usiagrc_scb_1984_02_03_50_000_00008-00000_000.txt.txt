Love and frustration in the Soviet Union

A Grinnellian’s personal view of the mysterious land

by Mary Schwah

“How was Russia?" you asked. In
ten words or less. . . it was a love~hste
relationship, all the way. Beautiful,
ugly, eye-opening. frustrating,
fascinating, and confusing — all those
words describe the Soviet Union,

On Jan. 29. when the twenty of us,
18 students and Professors Daniel
Kaiser and John Mohsn, left Helsinki
on a night train bound for the Soviet
Union, non of use knew what to ex
pect. yet each of us had expectations. 1
went to find answers and instead I
came back with a million new ques-
tions.

Our first taste of the CCCP began at
the border — actually quite uneventful
and disappointing. The border guards
didn't search our suitcases or act par
ticulsrly intimidating, there were no
barking dogs or Sub-machine guns; in-
atead. they asked us if we had any
fruit and confiscated the cheese we
had purchased in Helsinki

All that hype and swuting for
nothing. In fact, the uniforms barely
showed an interest in us at Ml. The
border was a bit of a letdown, but 12
hours later we arrived in Mosoow and
I didn’t feel let-down again for three
weeks.

The size of Moscow was the that
thing that amazed me: a city of eight
million with daily visitors averaging
about two million. Modern, blase
Soviet architecture stands adjacent to
the most incredible Russian Orthodox
churches, most of which are used as
museums today. The contrast between
the prefab construction. the red ban~
ners glorifying the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union and the gold
oupolas spoke for itself.

Speaking of red banners, Lenin is
everywhere. Let me repeat that. Lenin
is EVERYWHERE, His ubiquitous
nature almost had are convinced that
there was no need for any other God.

Travelling arouno Moscow was a
joy. The metro system has no equal in
exiswnce. For approximately seven
cents you can ride the metro to
anywhere you could possibly desire. if
you get bored somewhere along the
way, you can get off at the next stop
and spend the twominute gap bet-
ween trains admiring the station. if
that is what anyone in their right.
mind could call it. Each station is
designed differently. and each could
be an exhibit in itself: chandeliers,
marble and monuments are all im»
maculatc,

After spending seven cents on the
metro, to get to Red Square I was
almost convinced that socialism really
works, Then I stepped outside the sta~
tion and watched a seventyryesr-old
babuahka (i.e., grandmother type)
chopping the two—inch thick ice on the
sidewalk. and her comrade, also a
babusldra, removing the ice with a
“shovel” made of a wooden pole and a
flat piece of plywood.

True, there is no unemployment in
the Soviet Union, but the Seventy-
year-old woman shoveling the
sidewalk would never be my grand
mother if I had anything to say about
it. The ice-chopping habushkas were
everywhere. in the shadows of Lenin

dangers of nuclear war. This was true
whether we were at the Lenin Museum
in Moscow, die Medical institute in
Kursk. the Agricultural Institute in
Kharkov, or the Museum of the
Revolution in Leningrad, l have never
encountered a group of people so con-

and the military uniforms.

Actually. the abundance of uniforms
didn’t bother me —— as a rule they paid
as very lime attention. The real in-
terest came from the ordinary people
on the street, in the metro, at the
theater, at the museums, and in ﬁle
art galleries. In Moscow and [en
ingrad tourists are common; the hotels
and the foreignrcurrency stores are
regular tourist~traps. overflowing
with souvenirs.

The average Ivan on the street
stared but didn't appear stunned by
our presence Until I became an
customed to it. the stares really
disturbed me. almost frightened me. I
mean. niece people didn’t just glance
and turn away, they gawkcd. I kept
wondering what they were thinking,

After three weeks I realized how ter-
ribly insensitive and unfair I had been
at first to think I could generalize
what “the Soviet people” thought of
me anymore than I can now possibly
generalize how I feel about the
Soviets. My impressions of the people
multiplied as we travelled further.

From Moscow we trained to Kursk.
famous for the great w H battle
fought there Kursk, however, was not
the only city in which we were remind
ed of the damages inflicted by the so
cond world war. In fact, every city of-
fered several monuments and
memon'als of the Great Patriotic War.
as the Soviets refer to it.

Furthermore, nearly all of the open-
ing or closing remarks of our hosts in-
cluded a rather lengthy account of the

 

Scious of the effects of war.

That is not to say that these people
are war-mongers; just the opposite is
true. They all seem to be incredibly
afraid that the Americans are ready to
nuke them out of existence at any mo-
ment, Even in casual conversations, so
many of the Soviets we encounWred
would emphasize the need for peace
between our two powerful nations.

One of the best examples of their
fear comes from our experience in the
Kursk War Museum. it was not the
lecture I heard about the damages suf-
fered in W ll that moved me, nor
did the closing statemean of the guide
about the horrors of nuclear war
drastically affect me. What frightened
me and even made me feel guilty were
the stares we felt from the Russian
school children touring the museum.
Our presence amazed them. They were
mm between feelings of awe and fear,
and it was Written all over their faces.

I really wanted to walk up and ex~
plain to them that none of us had per»
sonally had anything to do with put-
ting the Pershing 11’s in Europe. Un-
fortunamly, I am not Sure they would
have believed me even lfl had done so

After visiting Kursk, we left Russia
and toured Kharkov and Kiev in the
Ukrainian Republic. Much more than
the language changes when you leave
Russia. The whole atmosphere is dif-
ferent, The people are much more
well-dressed and they even smile occa~
sionally. something rarely seen on the
streets of Moscow.

The welcome We received at the
Agricultural Institute in Kharkov was
unmatched at any other stop, The
students. professors and ad-
ministrators demonstrated so much
enthusiasm about meeting us. The red-
carpet treatment was almost ember
rhssing. I kept thinking. who are we to
receive a reception like this. The
students were so anxious to meet us,
They so desperately wanted to know
what our lives were like in America.

After they served us something
resembling a banquet and forced us to
take fresh fruit with us, We concluded
our tour and headed for the bus. They
followed us to where the bus Stood
waiting, took pictures, exchanged ads
dresses, begged us to write and swod
Outside the institute waving good-bye
for as long as they could still see us.
Not a person on the bus left the in-
stitute unmoved,

The Republic of Estonia followed
the Ukraine, We spent three days in
Tallinn, on the Gulf of Finland. Once
again the language changed.
(drastically at that — Estonian
resembled no other language that any
of us had ever heard) and the society
there differed from the Russian socie~
ty as much as the language did.

The people appeared to have a much
higher standard of living than we
witnessed in Russia. Beautiful hand
woven scarves and sweaters ﬁlled
store windows. It was actually a
challenge to find a portrait or bust of
Lenin. The Estonisns had great pride
in their national heritage and it was
not difficult to detect agitation in
their voices when they spoke of
Russia.

The architecture in Tallin’s Old
Town showed a strong Scandinavian
influence. Walking through the win-
ding, narrow streets of the Old Town,
it was virtually impossible to believe
that we were still in the Soviet Union.

While in Tallinn we visited a
Kindergarten. which was actually

 

in fact, these palaces have been
restored because they show the beauty
of old Russia 7 a beauty lacking in
Soviet Russia. In every art gallery we
entered, our guide showed us the
18th and mm century paintings with
pride. then gave us ten minutes to
walk quickly through the Soviet ar-
tists' rooms on our own.

The palaces epitcmpc an attitude of
the Soviet govemment which runs
through every aspect of the Party’s
consciousness. Their hfestyle rims ten
to fifteen years behind that of the
West. They don't want us to witness
what is inadequate in their society.
and at times we were told outright has
by our guides.

There are those citizens who tnily
do not want to be there, have re
quested permission to leave and have
subsequently lost their jobs.
(Everyone is free to leave the Soviet
Union, just as there is freedom of
religion and guaranteed employment)

The government ignores the lack of
creativity in the art of Socialist
Realism. They attempt to dierhct at-
tention from what is lacking and what

more of a day-care center in our sense
of the word. This Kindergarten stays
open from 7 s.m. to 7 pm. It is possi
ble [or parents to leave their children
there for the entire 12 hours if
necessary. Once again I was almost
convinced that socialism really does
work: the cost of caring for each child
totals about 60 rubles a month, of
which the parents pay no more than
12 rubles, according to their ability.
and the state pays the rest.

The children were very well cared
for as a rule throughout the Soviet
Union. However, we did note a
definite tendency to segregate the
girls from the boys, consequently
some learned sewing and others took
shop-traming.

The train to Leningrad took us out
of Estonia and back to Russia, Again,
the change in atmosphere struck me
immediately, The mood of Russia I
had become accustomed to, but the
palaces of Leningrad frustrated me.
So many of them had been almost
complemly demolished during the
seige of World War ll. The Soviet
government has spent billions of
rubles to restore these palaces which
represent a system they came to
change,

in a Marxian sense the palaces are
significant because they demonstrate

brought about the revolution of the

is suppressed by bombarding you with
Repin’s paintings and Tchaikovsky’s
music. The government achieves that
distraction by separating the
foreigners from the Soviets whenever
possible.

The best goods are found in the
foreignrcurrency stores, along with
the imported cigarettes and alcohol,
The hotels in which we Stayed were
stricuy for foreigners e Soviets were
not welcomed at any hour. Even the
hospital in which one unfortunate
member had to spend a night was only
used for foreigners and diplomats
Clearly. the inadequacies of the socie
ty were not in places accessible to
foreigners. just as the Dunhill cigaret-
tes and the Johnny Walker scotch
were not in places accessible to the
Soviets,

it is impossible to leave the Soviet
Union without a sense of awe inspired
by the great beauty the country holds:
