A New Kind of Patriotism

It wouldn’t have sounded so surprising to
us if Colonel l-Ioldridge had been just plain
Mr. Holdl‘idge. If he’d been wearing all
academic cap and gown or a business suit,
the words he spoke to us yesterday morn-
ing in chapel woudn‘t have hit us so hard.
But an army colonel in uniform and brass
buttons and medals telling college students
to do all they could to finish their educan
tion—we could hardly believe it, Here was
no recruiting officer pointing his finger
and saying, “Uncle Sam needs YOU!" Oil
the contrary, he was telling our youth to
enlist in the reselyes for the Big Fight
would come after thiswar was ove‘ What
kind of patriotism was he preaching, any-
way? .

Well, let’s look at what he said. He said
that the side that wins is the one that can
put in the largest number of reserves at the
crucial time, when the real issues have to
be decided. He called upon us here at Grin-
nell college to become well-educated mem-
bers of that reserve corps, the one that will
have to clear up the mess when the war
has been won

Col, Holdridge was preaching to us an
intelligent unlimited patriotisml It is not
limited in time; it represents our country
in terms of the past and fuure. This war
is not such a desperate»back-to—thewall
struggle that our leaders need to “use‘up
the reserves” rashly. Intelligent patriotism

- is not limited in vision, It sees our nation's

shortcomings and the shortcomings of our
allies. It will try to correct past mistakes
and form new plans. If we let it, it will be
our ballast against such narrow‘minded acts
as taking the German language out of the
public schools or ostracizing people of
Japanese descent.

Not the kind of speech we expected to
hear from a colonel in the army, But of

 

 

‘ a gentleman and an accomplished scholar

course he told us that he was speaking his
pe solial COIlVlCLiOllS and r. l‘nosc ol’ the
“11' Department. We were l cning to one
man's thoughts on he problem: we were
not hear lﬁ' the army cllct tge men to
finish tlicii education.

The expedient of tho x:emational sit—
uation has made it impoc )lc for many
peopleial’my officials and civiliansito see
beyond tllc present. The \V Department
is taking men out of school. Far from be-
ing eager to tl'alll their minds for the
future, many college men want nothing more
than to get into the fight. College girls
laugh at the idea of being ”shock troops.”
Col. Holdridge’s speech was not what they
expected to hear.

This army man’s address seemcd the most
effective recruiting speech we have heard.
He was recruiting our capabilities so that
they would be educated toward service. He
really meant, ”Uncle Sam wants you and
your dreams and ideas now and always."

A few years from now, we will have to
be building up a society instead of tearing
one down. Then there will be a tremendous
need for patriotismanot the “Slap the
Japs" kind, hilt Colonel Holdridge’s kind.

Hasta La Vista, Senor

Today Grinnell college bid adieu to a mem—
ber of the facility after seven fine years

fashions . $5,; .

Hello, all you gals and guys of
old crinncll. it was certainly
grand to see so many of you
down here for the game last
Friday night. Incidentally. it was
a mighty fine game and I’m sure
you’re all proud of Grinnclrs
fighting team,

Whoopl This is supposed to be
a fashion column and not the
latest sports news, so guess I‘d
better settle down to business.
The fashion business is an intern
estuig one at the present because
of the many changes brought
about by the curtailment of man
terials due to the eu ncreasing
war needs, Nylon hose arc prac-
Lically extinct, the allrround
pleated skirt is making a quick
fadecut. suit Jackets are two to
thnee inches shorter than former-
ly, sweaters are lcss sort and
thick, the fellows are going With-
out vests or cuffs, and synthetics

 

arc becoming more important
every day,
In these times, when the

younger generation is seeing war
for the first time, the fashion
world, which is constantly chang-
ing even in normal times, is

Changing almost daily. Delivery
of merchandise slow, fashion
promotion and advertising have
become more and more war con-
salons and the merchandise: is
dnll‘lg ills bit to keep up Ameri-
can morale and is stxiving to co—
operate with oiu- government in
every way possille. As a morale
builder fashion is tzuny impor-
tant: Take a look around, there's
the “Jeep" hat, a pair of shoes
labelled “Alert”, a sweater call-
ell “Johnny Dinghboy' which.
comes in “Allied colors", 3. dress
called “Furlough Bride"; each es
pecially named to keep 'us war
consctolls. They're colorful, they‘re
gay, and they help us inspire our
men and woman who are doing
their Jobs in unilorm.

And so, you nice people, let's
keep weLlrdresst-d, cheerful, and,
incidentally, get in there and
pitch at those studies. That’s your
way to do your part I hope to be
down some weekend to look over
the old campus: bow is it since
the army invasion? I'll be back
again soon with more chatter and

the latest news from the fashion
front.

 

 

more so that his quiet mannelism would
suggest. Few of us know that Mr, Smith,
instructor in Romance languages and or-
gan, received his bachelor’s degree in music,
his master’s degree in geology, and has al—
most completed his doctor’s degree in
French Mr. Smith has not confined his
studies to America. He was a student of
the organ in Paris under Marcel Dupre. All
of us who heard Mr. Sm'th’s vesper recital
Sunday know of his all ity on the organ.
He comes by this honestly—his mother, an
organist herself, giving Mr. Smith his first
lessonsl That he is a man’s man in addi-
tion to being a scholar is proved by his love
of the north woods where he “roughs” it
every summer. That he is perfectly balanc-
ed is known to us all by his esthetic tastes
so profitably shared by us all at Grinnell.
His students in Romance language know of
his proficiency in Spanish, French, German,
and Portuguese. For the fun of it, Mr.
Smith took a civil service test for transla-
tors, making a high score in both Spanish
and French.

His pupils enjoyed his fine sense of
humor, his patience, and understanding
when the going was hard,

It is indeed hard to say “Adios, amigo"
to the Senor, but Uncle Sam evidently needs
him more than Grinnell. On behalf of the
countless friends you have made in the col-
lege and the town, and until we again have
the pleasure of your company, Mr. Smith,
we say, “Hasta la vista, Senor."

DuncanI Pooley
Are New Advisors
For Publications

Thomas Duncan, assistant pro-
fessor of journalism, and John
Pooley, instructor in economics
and business, were named to the
publications board as faculty rep~
resentatives in a meeting or that
body yesterday afternoon.

Duncan, who came to Grinnell
this fall, will succeed Herschel
Colbert as chairman of the board.
Mr. Pooley will replace Mrs. Shel—
(on L. Beatty.

Press Club Asks
For Applications

Upperclassmen interested in journ
nalism and desiring membership
in Press club should contact Bar-
bara Brann, president, before
Oct. 20, Miss Brann announced
last night. Applications should
state interest in a particular phase
of journalism, and past joumal-
istic experience.

Mrs. John H. Pooley, sponsor,
was present at the first meeting
of the club, held last evening. A
program for the year was plan-
ned, including book reviews and
guest speakers. -

The program committee, ap-
pointed by the president, is com-
posed of Anne Crews. chairman,
Sally Bruno, and Doris Williams.

Election of officers will be held
at the next meeting.

Haines Hall l

Ghost Stalks Halls
invaded
Is Haines haunted? IS the hall

of the hellers boxed? if not,
what was the unearthly “thing"
in white that stalked the halls
last night at midnight?

“It” was all white, observers
report, even to the toenails that
peered out from beneath its ﬂow-
ing garment, and its face was a.
pale skullrlike mask. it moved
stealithy reports say. making no
noise except an occasional high»
pitched wail, and a slow, paced
flapping of its white-clad arms.

Heines girls, awakened from
sound sleep by the apparition, are
reported to have said various
thingsimost of them unprintabie.
One slumbering sophomore open-
ed one eye, closed it, opened it
again, and then sat up and yell-
ed.

Another, evidently a practical
soul, eyed the “banshee" coldly,
and said, “Will you shut the door
when you go out, please?"

Don‘t laugh. A ghost in any
cottage is nothing to laugh about.
of course, the “white, flowing
garment" could have been a sheet,
and the “skullrlike mask” could
have been face cream.
