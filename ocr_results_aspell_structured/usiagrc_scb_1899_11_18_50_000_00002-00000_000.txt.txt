Now THAT the regular football
season is coming to a close, it
seems that a series of class games
might be arranged which would
not only arouse class spirit, but
stir up enthusiasm in favor of the
game. One step has already been
taken in this direction in the
game scheduled for Monday at—
ternoon between the two upper
classes ot the academy. This
custom is especially desirable
among the lower classes. since it
teaches new men the rudiments
of the game, and it is not seldom
that men who need only training
to make ﬁrst team material are
brought out by these games.
With the continuance of this ﬁne
weather, SCARLET AND BLACK
hopes to see some such series of
games carried out.

THE FACT that little has been
said in these columns in regard to
debating, and especially to our
annual debate with Cornell this
year, should not be taken to indi-
cate that the interest in this de-
partment of college lite is abat-
ing. Quite the contrary at this is
true. Representatives of Grins
nell Institute and Chrestomathia
have been hard at work pre-
paring for the preliminary debate
between the two societies in which
the choice of men to debate with
Cornell will be made. The ques—
tion which was submitted by Cor-
nell for debate is, “Resolved.
that immigration into the United
States should be denied to all who
cannot read and write the Consti-
tution of the United States in some
language." Grinnell has chosen
the afﬁrmative and as soon as the
preliminary debate is over our
representatives will begin hard
work on the question. But it we‘
are to win with Cornell this year,
we must not expect the three men
who debate to do all the work.
This has, unfortunately, been the

casein the past, and we need one
1y to point to our record of the past
three years to show the results of
this method. In other institutions
the debaters are only the leaders
in the work, and all who have an
interest in society work are exr
pected to render all the assistance
that they can, In Cornell this is
the way they work, everyone tak-
ing an interest in the debate and
each student feeling personally
responsible tor the outcome of
the debate. In this way, and one
ly in this way, can we ever hope
to attain the position in intercolr
legiate debating which should be
ours.

A Gift to the Museum,

Prof. Macy recently received a
very intercsting‘ relic which has
been given to the college museum
by W.W.Peet, of Downers Grove.
Illinois, a former student in the
college. Mr. Feet. atter leaving
college, spent some time in travel
and in the course of his travels
secured this relic. In a letter ace
companying the gift the donor
says: “Yesterday, betore leaving
tor this place, I gave to the ex-
press company a small box ad-
dressed to your good selft It con-
tains a small stone evidently
shaped with great care into the
form of a ball. I picked up this
stone on the site of the Homeric
Troy when on a visit some three
years ago to the excavations made
there, The stone ball is a mill
stone and is used with another, a
larger one, having a bowl like de
pression or cavity, and with this
one,I am sending, in the hand,
the grain can be bruised intoa
kind of meal or ﬂour. I found the
relic near to the ruins that Dr.
Schlieman, the excavator of Troy,
has pronounced the Treasure
House of Priam the localityin
which his great find ot Trojan or.
naments (or jewelry) was made,
and i wish to present it to the
college museum.

Yours faithfully,
W, W. FEET.
