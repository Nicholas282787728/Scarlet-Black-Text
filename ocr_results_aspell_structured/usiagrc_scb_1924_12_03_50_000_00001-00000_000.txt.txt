New Plan Presented int Meeting of All
Depositols Will Establish
Adequate Trust Fund.

FEELING OF OI’TIKISM IS
PREVALENT m COMUNI’I‘L

50 Per Cent of Check: g Amunts Mity
be Used as. Needed; 40 Per Cent
in Trust Fund.

Preliminary action looking to the
reorganization of the Merchants Nil-
tional Batik was taken Saturday or —
ning when a capacity attendance of
600 depositors and friends of the
bank met in the high school auditor-
ium, on call of Mr. Leyburn, receiver.

It was a. meeting of, by and for the
depositors, and although no formal
action was mken, the plan for more
Eanizdtion was placed before the de
positors, a committee was appointed,
and the movement for reorganization
was actually launched,

Some of the features of the plan as
submitted by bll‘. Leyhurn follow: On
each 5100. of deposits in individual or
checking accounts, the depositors can
check out fifty per cent of this deposit
as needed; 10 per cent to participate in
'a certificate of deposit, due in one,
year at 4 per cent interest; the re—
msining 40 per cent to he in the trust
fund without lnterest~thus releasing
some funds for the immediate needs of
the depositors. ,

As for saving accounts, a new car-
tificate of deposit will be issued by the
new National Bank for a year for Lil]
per cent of this savings deposit, at l
per cent interest; the remaining 40 per
cent to he in the trust fund without in—
terest.

.Tirlre Certificates

To those holding time certificates of
deposits, a new certificate of deposit
will be issued by the new National
Bank for do per cent of the deposit
due in one year with 4 per cent inter--
est. If conditions warrant it, the new
bank shall have the right after one
year to renew this so per cent for an
additional 5 months, at A per cent in-
terest. The remaining in per cent
will participate in the trust fund with
out interest.

This trust fund in reality means that
the depositors and other creditors are
allowing to per cent of their total
claims to bc liquidated in an orderly
manner over a period of years to bet-
ter advantage, and 60 per cent is
represented by cel'tifiuiltics of agree-
ments in the new National Bank.

As the plan by Mr. Leyhurn indicat—
es, the proposed new bank will
have capital of $100,000 and surplus
of $10,000. but no effort was made at
the meeting to sell stock. The meet-
ing was called to give the depositors
an opportunity to know the conditions,
to understand the plan that has been
proposed, and to take such action as
they may see fit.

Siiin‘t of Optimism

An encouraging indication of the
attitude toward the plan was shown
when, in response to the question,
“How many want the hank reopenedl",
every man and woman in the audience
stood up. There was a feeling of
optimism throughout the meeting that
nugurs well for the efforts of the var-
ious committees and officials, who
feel that with the cooperation of all
classes the bank can be reopened with.
in la reasonably short time. to the
be’ncfrt of the entire community. The
committee appointed to talie up the
organization is meeting each day, and
from reports depositors are generalis-
ly signing up the agreement to leave
their deposits in the reorgnn-zed hank.

session Sunday evening, passed sev-
ei'ftl important rules. The most im-
portant of these concerns the seating
in the chapel,

Heretofore, it has been the custom
to divide the chapel in two sections,
one in which the women were to be
seated and in the other the men. The
new rule passed by the Council, pro»
vides that one may sit any place so
long as he does not violate the ranks
of Seniority. As hitherto observed,
seniors will occupy the trout rows;
the juniors the next section, etc; how.
ever ll a senior or student of lower
rank desires to sit with a lowcr class
friend he will be forced to sit in the
seals for them. It is thought that
this new rule will act as a stimulus to
chapel attendances and thereby
crease chapel interest. This new ar-
rangement marks the end of an old
tradition, which has been observed
almost rigidly since the entrance of
chapel services into college life.

Students on Cnillluil'tce.

Election of two students into the
faculty Chapel Committee also marks
the introduction of anew step into
student self government, Before it
has been the custom of the three
members of the faculty chapel comr
mittec to select the speakers or to ar—
range chapel programs With the
addition of two students to this com»
mittee it is felt tilat students will
have more speakers and programs to
their liking.
A third rule passed has to do with
the accumulation ol surplus “rec”
hour tunds. Hitherto it has been the
custom to allow these to accumulate
and better "rec" hours could be put
on occasionally. Under the new pro—
vision any excess of money left over
after the expenses have been paid may
