art and has become the out
standing representative of cone

produced some 1,300 pictures
depicting the farm and village

still producing the kind of art
that seems to have so much ape

Her work, first seen in a drug
store in 1939, was brought to

Etienne in New York, and in
man the gallery held a “one-
man show" which placed the
elderly lady from the farm in
the limelight of the art world.
