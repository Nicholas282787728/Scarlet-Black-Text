On Wednesday, October 30,Norris
Hall hosted a Halloween Carnival
with a haunted house and activity
area for school children at tlle Hams
Center. Children were allowed to
tour the haunted house from 5:00
until 10:00 pm and College students
from 10:00'until 11:00 pm.

“It was a group idea at the hall
council meeting." said Bridle Rob-
erts ‘00, community schlce coordi»
nator for Norris. “It’s really impor-
tant for Grinnell students to take inl-
tiative and build good townrcollcge
relations."

Funding and food and drink do-
nations, which totaled approximately
$800 in value, were acquired by
Norris Hall Chair Alexi Zentner ‘97
and Hall Social Coordinator Eric
Turner ‘98. Pam Ferguson, Tom
Crady, Dining Services, Stephanie
StephenrMeyers, the SGA. Public
Relations, the Office of Admissions
and Norris Hall dorm funds all cons
tributed to the Halloween Carnival.
This money was used to set up an
area of booths for the children, pay
for props for the haunted house and
to provtde complementary refresh-
ments and candy.

Roberts managed the event. “I
was in charge of volunteer COOl’dlr
nau’on, pulling together all the groups
and making sure everything was set
up correctly," she said.

a student posing as a cadaver, and the
suicide room which Contained
graphic depictions of death proved
especially upsetting to young chil-
dren. After several complaints the
tour of the haunted house was rear»
ranged to allow parents to decide
which rooms were appropriate. “If
[the kids] were really upset we would
bring them to each room to meet the
actors and show them that it was ok,"
said tour guide Cori Zagrtrella ‘00.
An area with arts and craft activir
ties and games provided an alternar
tive to the haunted house. “At first I

didn‘t want . . , the dorm to do it
because it seemed the main objecV
tlvc was to scare children and it
seemed a bit much for the little kids,"
said face painter Amy Lingenfelder
‘99, “ but when they suggested the
idea of the carnival [had to help out."

“I had twenty or thirty parents
come up to me and tell me how great
it was,” said Zentner. After six hours‘
and approximately 150 kids, the co-
ordinators ofthe Norris Hall Hallows
een Carnival were pleased. “lts ime
portant to give back some of what
the town gives to us through com-
munity relations," said Roberts, “1
think it was a success."

Clay said, “you try to build a policy
that averages in market values to
smooth out the impact, 4.5% is a
conservative but reasonable policy
compared to our peers." Last year
19.3 million dollars derived from the
endowment was used to ﬁnance the

The rest of Grinnell’s annual re—
maining expenses are covered by tu-

The current and extremely costly
construction on campus is not being
paid for. primarily, by the endow-
ment. According to the Mr. Clay's
Office of the Treasurer report, the
renovation ofBowen Hall ofScience
cost $15.3 million, the expansion of
the Fine Arts Center cost $22 mils
lion, and the renovation ofGoodnow
cost $2.2 million, The report indie
cates that “All of these projects are
posstble because of the Grinnell
Campaign,”

The Campaign, which was an-
nounced by the trustees in Septem'v

in gifts from alumni in order to cons
tinue and enhance the quality of a
Grinnell education. Mr. Clay's report

In response to theissues surround-
ing this event, SGA President Rupln
Thakkar ‘97 said, “1 think the core
of the controversy on campus right
now is whether or not the ad in the
GUM was intended to be racist. And
I think the students who organized
the discussion on October 17th were
trying to get across that racism is not
about intent, it's about ignorance.
And the fact that students on this
campus can perceive that ad as not
being racist is a challenge to ourcam—
pus for stronger education in this
area.”

The Apalagy

There has been controversy sur-
rounding the actual apologies offered
by Buettner and Moran. Buettner has
apologized “for the fact that [the ad]
was misinterpreted as a racist attack

encapsulates the importance of not
using the endowment for the expan-
sion and renovation projects stating,
“If we used endowment income for
building projects, we would not be
able to provide the unique Grinnell
experience to current students. Ifwe
dip into the corpus. we will rob fu»
ture students of the programs the
endowment makes posstble."

Last spring, in order to help pay
for the new Fine Arts Center, the cola
lege sold $12 million in 5-year
bonds. This represents an outstand-
in g debt to the college and some have
wondered why Grinnell, having so
much money, would do such a thing.
Mr. Clay explained that there was a
need to start building Fine Arts be-
fore all the gifts to the Grinnell Cam-
paign were received. In ﬁve years
when the college must pay this debt,
the funds will be in hand,

Buettner said, “I am apologizing
for something I did, and that was
using ASIA’s acronym as well as the
words ‘asinine’ and ‘ludicrous’."
