Self-motivated
language
program

pro osed

by Terri _orter
serbotroation. Japanese. Hebrew and

Italian are the four languages which .i
Curriculum t‘timmittee proposal suggests
be taught in {I ‘rritical" languages
program to b‘egin next year

The critical languages program is
basically a “self'~paced language in
struction program." according to Ilean
Catherine Frazer, the head nl the
Curriculum Committee, Mark Bradshaw
who heads the Curriculum ('ouncil. cit»
plained that the studies are conducted on
an individual, no-credit basis. Students
learn from language tapes without the
guidance of a professor. The committee
also hopes to acquire some native
speaking tutors with whom students can
converse. The maximum time which a
student may study a language is 'our
semesters.

Theidea lorthe program originated u ith
Jenny Michaels, an associate professor ul
German. Before the idea can he acted
upon. however, the Curriculum Committee
must go through a number oi steps. They
are currently taking an informal survey
among the language professors to see it
there are any major objections to the
program. The major reservation if“
present. according to Bradshaw. concerns
student motivation. Since there is no
professor teaching the course. there is
theoretically “nothing to provide
discipline or structure." explained
Bradshaw.

He noted the other steps that \uiuld
probably have to be ioliowed before 'he
program could be instituted These
procedures include bringing in a consul~
tant from Cornell College or Hamilton Col-

lege, schools where the program has been
successful to discuss the methods for

beginning such a program at (irinnell The
topic would then be presented In the
faculty and sent back to the committee for
final approval. Bradshaw remarked that
the program is "still very much a topic at
discussion,” but added that the “reaction
to the suggestion of the program has been
favorable." According to Frazert reaction
is favorable because the languages have
been requested for a number of years.

As to the success of the program it it Is
instituted. Bradshaw stated. "From lIi\
experience. these program: can he yer)
effective, At this point.. I'm ’t'autlnusl)
optimistic. There are still if lot of details
that need to be taken care of " Ht‘ added.
”Right now. we have .1 good language
program, This would make ll a much ninro

comprehensive progam."

,Duksfein chosen to edit

by Terri Porter

The Cyclone is back on solid ground
after the recent threat of its termination.
The possum demise.“ theysarbook for
the 1932-32 school year arose because few
students were willing to fill its many staff
positlons,

The most significant problem was the
lack of an editor to head production of the
annual, This Situation was alleviated
when, upon the announcement of the
Cyclones possible termination. seven
students applied for the editorial position.
Each applicant was interviewed by the
Student Publications and Radio lSPkRi
Committee which finally chose Karl
Dukstein, a senior. for the position,

According to SP&R Chairman Richard
Letchlnger, Dukstein has had experience
working on past yearbooks Lelchinger
noted that “The committee felt Dukstein
could do 2t good job.” Letchinger added.
“There were many good applicants ._ it lot
of them were freshman.“ He hopes that
they will continue to Work on the staff with
the possibility of becoming editors in the
iuture He explained, “In essence. we're
hoping , to build a sellaperpetualing
medium,”

yearbook

There have been years when there has
been no yearbook. When asked it similar
problems may occur in the -future,
Letchinger replied that he did not foresee
any problems. He emphasized, “I'm very
optimistic about the number of freshmen
involved.”

To choose the rest of the staff. Dukslein
held an organizational meeting on
Tuesday night. During that session the
new editor interviewed students for
positions on the staff. Anyone who missed
the meeting and would like to be a staff
member should Contact Dukstein,

Discussing the style for the 1932,53
yearbook, Dukstein commented that it
would basically follow the format of last
year's book. ”It will be a high quality
yearbook." he said, adding that one of his
major goals is to get ”high quality
graphics so the book is visually exciting"

He cited another of his goals as editor of
die Cyclone is to “sell a lot of books." He
also stated, ”We all have goals to produce
the best book possible. If we get a good
staff and I don’t see why not, we should be

able’to put a good yearbook together.”
