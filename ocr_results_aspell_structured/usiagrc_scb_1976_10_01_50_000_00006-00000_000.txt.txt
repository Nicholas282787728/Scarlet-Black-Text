Faculty discuss “White Paper”

The faculty meeting on Monday,
September 20. in the Science
Auditorium was a fascinating
study in rhetoric for the students
who attended. It was a meeting
called especially to discuss the
“White Paper,” chaired by
President Turner and attended by
a majority of the faculty All
departments were well
represented, and many teachers
demonstrated their innate ability
to lecture.

The meeting was called to order-
by President Turner, who .ilns
niediaiely read into the minutes a
statement on the administrative
cuts. clarifying his position.
Speaking to the attacks made on
him by various people over the last
(cw weeks. he denied that the cuts
showed all antirleiniliist attitude on
the part of the administration. The
cuts, he maintained, were part of
an effort to “return the College to
ltvtiig within its means.” This is
in line with other position cuts
made recently' eight faculty posts
tvithinthetast three yeai's.and five
B&G jobs last year

Turner stated that it is merely
“unfortunate circumstance" that
all three administrative posts out
are held by women, Only one of the
positions cut is traditional to the
school, he assertedithat 0i ace
tivities counselor. The President
Commiserated With those who want
more Women in administrative and
faculty positions. saying that he
did not believe that this one Cut
showed a trend in hiring practices
for the whole College In fact, the
true trend in faculty h' 'ng lies
very slightly the other way: in the
fall of ms, 15 per cent of the
faculty in line for tenure was
female. This fall, the figure is 16
per cent. in addition to these
women, there are nine lecturers
who are Women.‘Qliihe women in
the tenure track, an are tenured;
two of them within the,last_three
years, Turner also saidrha't‘fﬁ per
cent of the administrative staff is
lemale, ~

While there is no Affirmative "

Action plan with quotas and
deadlines going on in the hiring
practices of Grinnell, President
Turner stated that ”Our plan is
simply to make as aggressive a
search as possible for every
opening, with an extra effort to
recruit women and minorities," He
alsosaidthatnoonewould behired
until a thorough search is made
He laid a heavy emphasis on the
Search for the best candidate,
regardless of race or sex All other
things being equal, a woman or
minority member will be hired,
But in all cases the best candidate
will get the job

Al the end of his speech, Turner
made the comment that the faculty
would do well to clean its own
house. pointing out that only two
women have served as voting
members on the Executive Council
in the last five years, (The
Executive Council is the highest
governing hotly oi the (acuity, and
is selected by faculty vote.)
President Turner‘s statement
does serve to clarify a few specific
issues at stake in the ad'
ministrative cuts, but fails to clear-
up the generalities, according to
several faculty members “While
it is all very well to talk of
aggressive searches and the best
possible candidate. such talk would
scemtotnean very little in the face
of the reccnt shuttle in which Tom
Iaatimer was handed the three-ill-
one job with no search at all.
Latimcr may well be the best
person for the Job, We won’t know

until he either succeeds at it or
bungles it,” remarked one

professor,

The rest of the faculty
meeting was given over almost
entirely to discussion of the “White
Paper," with the faculty meeting
as a “committee of the whole“
rather than as a tort-ha] body. A
time limit of one hour and fifteen
minutes was set on the discussion,
which turned out to be insufficient.
As the meeting was called into
session, President
relinquished his chair to Dean
Walker, that he might participate
in the discussion both as a faculty
member and as the author of the
paper, Before discussion was
opehed ' Turner spoke to
allegations of conspiracy on his
part to take over the school with
the help of the Trustees. Denying
the contentions emphatically, he
said there should be no fear that.

Alter President Turner’s
statement. the floor was opened for
questions and discussion. Mr.
Wubbels, a senior member at the
chemistry faculty, read a
statement dealing with the role of
the taculty at. Gl‘innell. He stated
that the two kinds oi leadership
available at a school, 2dr
ministralive and academic, have
been sadly lacking at Grinnell in
the past two or three years, par-
ticularly academic While the
“White Paper” is an opportunity
and invitation to Step back into the
academic leadership role so sorely
needed, he said that the emphasis
on personal growth is misplaced
Mr, Wllbbels said that teaching
should be the basic job at the
faculty, expressing the desire that
the faculty should not assume the
responsibility for anything but the
pursuit OI “Truth in the Arts,
Letters, and Sciences " There was
general agreement to this
statement.

Mr Kintner. history dept.
chairman. asked if programs from
other schools were used as models
in devising the suggestions in the
“White Paper.” and it so what
were those models. Turner’s
reply was “Yes and no.”He offered
the explanation that most of his
ideas came out of discussions with
students. 7 '4 -

Wubbels restated is ‘Original
point about" academics being the
central issue at Grinnell, with
which Mr. Yang. Instructor of
History, agreed. Mr. Yang asked if
the idea of fewer courses (cover
letter to White Paper, point No. it)
will mean a tradeolf, with more
difﬁcult c'o'lu‘sgs, or if it means that
Hie current 'courses are too
rigorous. Turner admieted that it
was a rather vague section, but

remarks

Mr Moore, department chair-
man and Associate Professor of
English, asked Turner it he had
more professional and pre
professional programs in mind
when he spoke of “a more practical
education.” Mr. Moore specitically
mentioned certification for
teaching, pre-med, and prerlaw,
Turner said there is no plan or
intent to institute additional
programs or expand the present
ones, Mr. Moore agreed with the
wisdom of such a'path,

While the question of personal
development is a continuing
concern of the faculty. there is not
any organized way of coping with
the academic advising professors
are supposed to do Mr. Voertman
supported the idea of increased
efficiency in academic advising,
but felt that the faculty Cannot and
should not be relied on to organize
any personal advising system
Instead, the iacully has and will
continue to support thosc ins
stitutions provided for personal
advising such as the n A. system.

Turner answered this by saying
that ilot everyone should par
ticipate in personal advising. He
mentioned that not everyone
necessarily likes his or her
Students. and that not all
professors are interested in coping
with ”adolescent identity crises,”
preferring to do what they came

Willing and able to help, he

Mr, Guroff, Associate Profgssor

status of the junior faculty and

involve them very much, that the
burden would fall on the senior

with the fact that the faculty is

asked Mr. Guroff if he meant that
the school should be built around
the interests of the junior faculrp
and their future career plans. Mr,
Jones said that the college has
defined itself in terms of the
younger faculty for ten years, and
should continue to do so, but should
not allow itsei! to be used totally as
a springboard

Mr. Erickson, William F Dodge
Professor of Chemistry and
chairman of the faculty, expressed
the belieftliat the physical size and
student-faculty ratio were the most
important points about Grinnell’s .
teaching staff, and that the way t“.
remain distinct from Carleton and
Lawrence was simply to have the
best faculty. He did not think that
Grinnell's unique characteristi s‘
could be fostered by massive
curricular changes,

Mr Yang then posed the
question most of the faculty had
been waiting to hear: “What is a
socially useful individual’!’ ,. The
values mentioned in the Papcri
who will be the judge? How can a
faculty member go about his
culcating values in a student when
the student is here primarily for
education, not indoctrination?"

Turner replied that he did not
have a specific definition in mind,
but was aiming at producing
people who were a “little ha
altruistic,” who would go out and
try to do something beyond
themselves. in order to teach
different values, it will be
necessary to have people teachinﬁﬁ
who have different points of view.
‘j‘lfhghe, aren't enough crazy people
'on this facility.”

Mr. Kleinschmidt, Professor 05‘
French, quoted from his address to
the faculty in 1970, when he was
Chairman of the Facility. He said
that the faculty should “work for
informed students, and hope for
formed ones.” The philosophy then
was that students should be
se ically informed, but not
.ethically ‘ingoctrinated. M
Kleinsehmidt, further stated thzt‘
the moral formation of students
should not be the aim of the
curriculum. , \

As the faculty was called rﬁ

Turner asked for specifics to be
addressed to Mr Erickson and
brought up for discussion at the
next meeting. He closed with the
statementthat he was only making
