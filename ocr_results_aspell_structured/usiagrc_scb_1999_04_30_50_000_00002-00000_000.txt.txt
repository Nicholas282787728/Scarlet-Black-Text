Paul Valencic

 

BY SARAH LIEBMAN

Paul Valericic, Residence Life Coordinator for Langan, Rawxon, and Gates,
made his ﬁrst impression on students as a zebra,

During student stafrtraining his first year as an RLC, one of the leaders
decided that everyone should wear a zoo mask because the training would
include a trip to the zoo. Valencic ended up with the zebra mask. He was
expected to explain why he was like a acbra. He was “mortiﬁed,"

The experience taught him that one can "try to apply boxed grad school,
boundaries" but that the key is to “try new things, be creative and have fun,
forget image.

He believes the zebra mask set the tone for his service as an RLC. “lfyou
can't laugh at most situations you are in the wrong spot,“ he explains.

Valencic was born in Marion, Iowa near cedar Rapids. In his hometown,
Grinnell had a reputation for “hippics and freaks." Valcncic found this notori-
ety intriguing. He had not intended to return to Iowa after graduate school,
but decided that ifhe got an oifei from Grinnell he would return. He chose
crinnell over a conservative school Montana. Valencie is glad hc “chose the
job over the lomtion."

When valencic leaves Grinnell at the end ofthis year after three years as an
RLC, which he describes as “:nough and about what he expected," he will
bring “conﬁdenc: from my experience here. Being here 24.7 and not knowing
what’s next has made me self-reliant and reliant on my colleagues" to a career
in community mental health or college counseling. He will also bring what
hc’s “learned from my colleagues here."

He appreciates the student Affairs department because it is large for a school
this size. In addition, Valencic believes that the Iowa Midwest mentality helps
keep people easy to get along with and conscious that their role is to serve the
studcnts.

Valencic has mixed feelings over the removal otan RLC position after he
leaves. He feels he sees both sides. He does not see himselfas an administrator
and feels closer to students. He “respeciisl the RLC program and what we do.
It is rough to see a position taken away" For him it is “not just a job‘, its our
lifestyle." Although he is angry, he feels he understands the decision. “I know

what it is like to run a budgct."

He has been pleased by the student response. He feels “emotional because
this is a job I’vc lived for three years," He sees student reaction as evidence that
students see and understand the importance otwhat he and the other RLCs
do. He believes that "students do need to have a say:

As an RLC, Valencic found it helpful that his graduate degree was in coun.
seling. otherwise, the menial healdi crises might have been overwhelming.
He found Grinnell an easier place to work because people know one another.

He likes the view students hold of MC; as friendly people rather than
disciplinaiians to avoid. He finds that with self—governance students look oui
for themselves and others. This mentality has become “ingrained in the cul-
ture" of the campus.

valencic works to promote health and wellness on crinnell stressﬁllcd
campus, he also tries to address alcohol problems through programming.

Valencic described thescxual assault at the end ofhis first year as a time he
qucstioncd whether or not he could be an RLC. The assault was “very public"
and he felt overwhelmed because he was “never off the clock” and could no
predict what was next. It was his first year and he was still experiencing
learning curve.

“Things exploded,” said Valencic. students were tired, stressed and “rightl
outraged,” They were concerned about their own safety and how the admin»
istration was handling the case. Valencie, as an RLC, was not accustomed to
being seen as part of the administration, and had no answers to give the Stu»
dents. -

Valencic learned that he needed to set boundaries. It was a good learning
experience but took an emotional roll. still, he learned to better “address-
siudent and personal needs.“

In his free time Valencic enioys traveling and visiting friends, and counts
himselflucky to have friends from graduate school living all over the country.

Like many students, valencic likes to leave Gtinncll, He enjoys the ouie
doors and participates in the Bike Across lowa. When he leaves his RLC posie
tion at crinnell, he hopes to live somewhere where he could participate in
more outdoor activities.

As he prepares to leave Grinncll, the zebra mask sits neatly in a box. For
Valencic, the position ofRLC was not a job, but a way oflife. Now he moves
on.

When faculty members bring their
dogs and children to smith hall on
Munditys, they don't party all night.
They spend the evening chatting and
eating dinner with students,

Smith hall started hosting pasta din.
ners for faculty a few weeks before
spring break. The dinners are held on
Monday evenings from 5:30 to 7 pm,
Catherine Persoon. 1m: torsniiih and
younker Halls, brought up the idea to
her student staff members, “who were
really enthusiastic about it," she said.

Persoon said that part ofwhat gave
her the idea was hearing many siudeiits
talk about wanting more contact with
faculty members.

“I've been blessed with a terrific, ‘

hardworking and motivated staff," she
said, commenting thai ii rook dedica»
rion and extensive planning to get the
dinners going. rirsi, Persoon requested
and received some money to pay for the
faculty members’ meals from Dean
swaita.

Then staff members thought up a
title, “Pasta and Profs," to go on an in.
vitaiion card to faculty. Rachel Bennett
’01. wrote the invitation, and Paula
Langsam ’01 made the design for the
cards,

Then students hand—delivcrcd the
invitations to faculty members. All the
faculty accepted and chose a date that
would besi fit their schedule.

Thus far, Mark Montgomery, Irene
Powell and their son and daughter;
George and site Drake; Jared Gardner,
Elizabeth Hewitt and their son; and
SylviaThorsoann-lirh, Michmith and
their dog, Calvin Rusthct, have at-
tended the dinners.

Michelle Durand ’01 said that they
invited professors who seem commonly
known as dynamic and interesting.
They also focused on professors who the
student stair members knew. "Its not
hard to find a lot ofprofs," she said.

“Profs like it and students like it,”
Durand said. “It’s hard to get people
to go to things, but we've had great turn»

Loggia Party Signs: Legal or

BY EMILY LARSON
Staff Wtitct

If you are looking for a party, iust
walk down the loggia on any given
Thursday or Friday. Parties thrown by
groups of students in Younkct and
Loose Lounges, and even off—campus
housing, often announce their gather-
ings clearly through the use ofihe trusty
ol’ loggia sign.

Although this method of advertis-
ing may be an easy and eiieciive means
oisprcading the word, it is usually
against campus life policies,

"All—campus weekend events held in
residence hall lounges or college owned
houses must be approved by the All-
Cam pus Events committee," states the
student Handbook.

However, it is diihciilt to gain ACE
approval for such parties, since most
lounges can hold a maximum ofonly
120 people, rather than the 1300 or so
which constitute the campus.

“If you advertise an event to the
campus, then it logically is an all cam»
pus event," says ACE coordinator 52»
rah Asch, ‘00. “You can'iciaim thatonly
certain people are invited to party that
you advertise publicly."

Therefore. loggia signs as well as
KDICand searzeiandcke/tannouneee
menis- ior nonrACE sponsored parties
are a violation ofthis policy.

This policy is not now. Now in place
for over ten years, the policy was origi.

“The choice was made on rhe ba-

pation in the weekly problem solv.
ing seminar that I gave in the fall,"
says Adelberg. "l chose the team and

alternaies well, since the train and ﬁrst
three alternates were our highesr scorv
ers, aii ﬁnishing in the top twenty per.
cent ofali participants."

The team's rank oiz7ih our of4 1 9
institutions was the best a tirinneli team
has finished since 1977,

“The only times we have done but»
tcr than that were in 1973 and 1974
when our teams included Mark
Ashbaugh and Robert Rumcly, who
were probably the two best math Stu-
dents I have known it ciinneli, and

our, with usually around 20 people
each rime."

“It’s cool to hear things from the
professors side," she continued.
“Tlicy'll talk about when they were
incollege,orabourheinganadvisor.
It's fun to see the different kinds of
professors in a nonacademic way."

Pcrsoun, recognizing the scparn»
iion between piofessors' and stu
dents' lives, noted, “We're working
to build community and create a
positive learning environment."

Bringing the faculty into the stu.
dents “home" and fostering their in.
teraciion outside the classroom
builds communication, she com—
mented. “It's also good for clearing
up misconceptions about school life.
It adds a perspective and it's a chance
for students to talk about issues in a
forum."

“It's exciting to have this happen»
ing, and to feel the energy from this,"
she said. “It's great how interested
students are to meet faculty as people,
and their partners and animals."

When Lecturer sylvia Thorson-
Smith, her husband, and their dog
came to dinner last Monday, it was
clear that students were interested in
her opinions about events going on
at the college, her comments on the
town's perceptions ofrhc college, her
involvement with the church and
sexuality issues, what brought her
here, her travels, her Alaskan origins,
the legend behind her dog’s name,
his escapades at obedience school,
and more. In fact, itwas hard iostop
talking at 7 o’clock.

Professor George Drake said that
the smim/Younker people should be
congratulated for having come up
with the idea.

"It was an excellent idea, a more
informal opportunity for facultyand
students to interact,” he said. “ l sus-
pect any faculty member would say
it's a good evening, and they’d be glad
to be asked.”

Drake, who attended Crinnell
and was also president for many
years, added that there used be more

cohol, it also served as a response to
the damage caused to dorm lounges
which held large parties. After rhc
construction ofthe Harris center and
the formation of the ACE Commit»
tee, the goal was to bring student
gatherings our of the lounges and
into Harris.

Lounge parties still occur, how
ever, and enforcement ofthese rcguv
lations often falls on the shouldersof
Director of Housing sieve Larson
and Director of student Activities
Lisa Marye.

"Usually iiii comes to my atten—
tion 1 send [the party organizers] a
note saying it isn’t ACE approved and
tell them to make sure they have a
lounge contract," says Marye.

Maiye says this enforcement is
“If I’m
going to run across it in my scope,
then 1 consider it allrcampus advcr»
tising," says Marye.

Furthermore, sieve Larson is
most likely to investigate if there is
excessive damage to the lounge or
collcgvowncd house that occurs.

Many students are unaware of
these policies, or simply disregard
them, For example, Jarrod Routh,
‘00, who held a party for his birth»
day last week, says “we had planned
on making posters to put up, but it
turns out that we were too lazy. I
knew there were some sort ofrcgulae
tions regarding loggia signs, bui I had
always thought that you simply

run on ii “as I set it” basis.

Scarlet 8’ Black - Friday, April 80

Students and professors gather
together for pasta, conversation

interaction betwccn studcnt and fuc-
ulty in the past. For example, faculty
members would be sponsors of the
dorms and they would chaperone
dances, he said.

“It became more ofa monologue
than I thought," he said, commcntr
ing that students asked about the past
ofthc college, (llc cutrcnt RLC situae
tion, and what things Drake used to
deal with when he was president.

Professor Mark Montgomery
agreed with Drake that it was a nice
event that he thought other faculty
Would enjoy coming to. He said that
whilc his children were :1 little shy and
rclucmnt to came, it looked like they
had a good time too.

“It was a lot ofwork for students,"
hc said. “Often students want more
contact with faculty, though it’s not
an easy thing to accomplish. For
people with childrcnin particular, its
not easy to come back to the campus
[in the evening)."

Durand is in charge of creating the
ads that inform studcnts oftlic guest
faculty member, which she puts up
in smith and Younkcr every week.

To make thc ads more interesting,
the student staff also made up a sur-
vcy of 12 biographical questions, bodi
funny and serious, and thucstcd that
faculty respond to four ofthcm.

Durand incorporates this infor»
mation into the ads, which also tell
students to send in thtir ID numbers
to Renee Bibby '00.

one week prior to the dinner,
Davin Remington ’01 reports thesiu—
dcnt IDs to Cowles dining hall, which
provides the staffwith the food and
some the dishwatc.

Mid-lac] Sims and the Forum have
provided them with pots and pans for
cooking. Bennett, Durand, and
Peisoon all expresscd appreciation for
the great help they've received from
the dining hall.

“Dining services have been so
hclpful in all that wc’vc done,” said
Persoon. “They've gone out oftheir

thing. Kudos to them.”

we went collecting and that counts as

Nick Teipolilli, ‘00, who tradi-
tionally throws a Madonna party ch
cry semester, is equally unaware oiihe
policy. “To be honest with you, 1 have
no idea what the rules are... I guess
I'm kind ofambivalent because people

Persoon and ihe student staff also
request that students who attend either

ners.

She said it was hard to decide to
limit the number oistudents attend.
ing the dinner, because they want the
dinners to be open to is many people
as possible.

”1r has to stay somewhat intimate
ioo," Persoon observed Thus, they do
cidcd to cap the attendance at 20 stu.
dents.

Another hard decision they made
was to give Younkcr/Smith residents
priority attendance to the dinners.
Anyone else can attend ifless than 20
students sign up.

The reason for the torus on these
residence halls, Persoon and Durand
noted, was that this has really been a
proyeciinitiatedbySmirh/Younkcrstu-
dcnt staff.

As Durand said. “\X/c wish war)»
one could come. it's hard tor us and
we feel kind dfbad, but we put in hours
ofworkforthis. it took usalong time
to ﬁgure out how to get everything to
come together.

This is like our version orsrudy
breaks, It’s nice to do something drat
measurably does something for Stu-
dents, rather ihan iust iced them or give
them prizes."

The dinners are held in Smith be»
cause, said Durand, “A lot happens in
Younker, and not as much happens in
smith. smith is also more intimate
than Younkct.”

Persoon, who lives in Younkcr,
agreed, commenting that the dinners
in Smith help bridge the gap created
from lots of things occurring in
Younker.

Durand and Persoon both recomr
mended that iaculty dinners be sei up
as a campuSrwidc event. “That: are so
many people to meet," said Durand.
“Hopefully wc’ll do this nextyear, too."

Faculty Katya Gibel Aroulay, Mark
Schneider and Vicki Bentley-Condit
will be the honored dinner guests for
the remaining wee’ks ofthe semester.

ACE and the Committee for student
Life (CSL). “Generally, I think a the
current policy needs to be investigated
and revamped,” says As-ch, Meetings
in both committees have discussed
ideas, and those offering input are ens
couraged to coniact them.

Until changes are made, those un.
aware ofthe policy will mostlikelycon.
