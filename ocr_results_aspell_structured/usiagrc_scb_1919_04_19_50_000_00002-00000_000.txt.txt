‘HE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLAOE

WHAT llll YOU THINK?

LIVES vs. xtnillhus.

“All. L0 build—to build—that is the
noblest of all the arts."

Drawing rooms, reception halls,
dining rooms, and loggins d0 not con-
stitute homes. How easy it is tu look
about and see structures buildetli
houses 7 commonly called, which in
their completeness are not humes.

But Gl'inuell’s college shomcs are
representatives of that noble ltrt. They
are the beautiful embodiments of
dreaerthe Origin of which is found
in the inspiration and faith radiated
from the lives cl men and women.
strong in the Grinnell Spirit.

Appreciation of our couegc homes
can not abound in the lullest measure
so long as that which has been created
is recognized by insigniﬁcant terms.
Let the inspiration and faith liberated
from uur college bellies be anginented
by a reverence of lives and not of
numbers.

THE ADVERTISING CLUB.

With the formation ol an'advertise
-ing club this week, Grinnell hits taken
a long step forward. It basplaced it-
'seli on record as favoring one o: the
newest professions—a. prorcssion be~
cause advertising has passed the stage
of a swindling game, a more scheme
whereby the innocent public might be
whocdled out of large sums or money

The Advertising Club or Grinnell
College, as it has come to be known,
by its liiliation with The Associated
Advert ing Clubs at the World, will
attord its members a great oppore
tunity to learn the “ins and outs" oi
the game and to come into contact
with many of the leaders of the pro-
fession. It my almost be cquside
cred an addition to the curriculum,
and may be used as a talking point to
bring high school noon to the college.

The fact that the local club is the
ﬁrst organization of its hind to be
formed in a college indicates to an
cxtcnt the standing of Grinnsll in the
immediate outside ‘world.

such innovations as this will do ti
great deal toward the upbuilding or
Grinnsu. The men of today Will not
accept the old-time theories and ideas
which were prevalent ﬁlly years ago,
and neither will the womcn. NOW is
the time to open the door to progress.
“Get the jump” on the other colleges.
Then Grinnell will be THE college of

the future.

the total membership is now eight.
Grinucll is an institution with an en-
