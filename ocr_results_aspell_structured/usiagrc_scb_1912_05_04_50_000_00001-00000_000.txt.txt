FORUM AND PHl-llElPil”
EFFECTIVELY PRESENT
THE GREAT GALEUTU

INTENSE SPANISH TRAGEDY
GRIPS BIG AUDIENCE
LAST EVENING.

FIRST TIME—Hi lMiilliil

Play Translated by Miss Sheldon
and Published by Local Soci-
eties—Presentation Marked by
Skillful Acting—Play is Tragic.

Last night Forum and Pllidelphica
societies gave “The Great Galeoto" at
the Colonial as the annual literary so-
ciety play. This great Spanish play
has been explained thru the columns
01 The Scarlet and Black. and its text
circulated in booklet form by the two
societies until its history and its place
in dramatic literature is iamiiiar to
every one in Grinneli who is interest
ed in this kind or artistic production.

The two societies have been bandi-
capped by the illness of some or the
cast and by other causes. but Professor
Ryan, with his capacity for getting
things done. succeeded in staging the
play in a manner worthy ot its great
ness. ‘

The theme at the play is very sim-
ple. A Spanish banker and his young
and beautilui wife have taken the son
of a friend. after that friend's death,
and have raised him as one of their
own lamiiy. Groundless gossip begins
linking the boy's name with that or
his beneioctor‘s wile. it seems impos-
sible to stop the wagging tongues. and
they eventually po =on the mind or the
banker against his ife and loster son.
The boy is involved in a duel to avenge
an insult to Theodora, the banker’s
wile. but Jillian. the banker. mkcs his
place and is mortally wounded. Ernest.
the toster son, and Theodora constant-
iy assert their innocence biit are not
believed; Julian dies ivlthoul. under
standing or lorgiving, and the two
are driven oiit into the street. The
tragedy lies in pitting ﬁne and high
spirited characters against liit great
heartless. gossip»i'eiiding pub The
slander is subtle and elusive and can~
not be traced to its source. nor can
any one be held responsible (or it. in
its close uni . oi theme and the relent-
less. cumulative lane with which it
iushes directly to its destructive con-
clusion. the play is one oi the strong-
est reccmly‘ presented in Grinnell by
either amateurs or proiessionals.

Miss Lona Sylvester as Tlieodo“i,
wile oi Jillian. interpreted her lilies in
a very satisinctory manner. Her stage
appearance was strikingly ellcctive
and she got into the spirit or the part_
and interpreted it acurntciy and grace-l
lulli

While it is uninir to singlc. out any
one oi the three leading characters as
the best. the palm probably goes to
Fred Little who tool: the part at Julr
inn. the banker of iladrid. His role is
ptihaus the strongest in the play. and
he is admirably ruled pli, al_ and
temperamentally tor the bar He
succeeded in making the trail tihu to
the jealous and (lesllErate husband in
an extremely effective manner.

Interesting Numbers Rendered
Last Wednesday 7 Program of

a Popular Nature.

Piol‘t sor Scllele glue the last at
his organ rccitals tor this year in Hcl'r
‘ t cliapci. lie prctiiced his program
by a few remarks on the naturc ol‘ the
program. ilanr people had criticized
the classical character ot' the organ
concerts. so Prof. Sclieve had planned
a popular program. with the exception
ot the first number. a very interesting
Fantasia and Fugue by Handel.
Though popular; in nature. the other-
numbers were by no means of little
worth, and were beautiful as well as
285V to understand.

The Toccata in F Minor" by San
lonie was very brilliant, and the
”Scene Religieuse" by Massenet. Cour
taining the weil~hnown “Melodie" was
beautiful. The “ Gavotte Character
istique" was very diflerent (mm the
usual this of organ solo. and Very
pleasing, tllo not as interesting as
other numbers on the program. The
“Bduerun’larsch” by Grieg. met with
the applause it deserved. iloszkotw
ski‘s “Deutschiand” contained a
strong melody throughout~which is
very characteristic ot Moszkowski. The
closing number. "Fantasie Triumph-
ale," by Dubois. was both powerful and
brilliant, and it is interesting to note.
was composed for the dedication ot
the Auditorium organ in Chicago.

Dean Brown. of Yale. Pleases Stu-
dents by Unique Address on
"Choosing a. Life Work,"

The Fridlll inoilnng chapel talk was
is on by Dciln Chai-lcs K. Brown, ot
the Yale Diiillii)‘ School. on the sill}
icct ot' "Choosing a Lil‘e Work." Al»
though this topic has bCCIl the subject
at many other addresses from the
same platlorm this year. Mr. Brown
succeeded in giiing it a new torm and
color. in his high tribute to iowa,
ranking her highest oi the states in
the union.

Taking up the idea of an education
for one's iile work he said that every
one must attend the great university
at experience. where the colors are
black and blue, and the curriculum is
unlimited. It is here that we must.
make our choice of a lite work. For
governing ono’s choice he laid down
ﬁve rules: First. do not choose too
early, {or one does not know biinseli
nor the world activities well enough
when he is in high school or the ﬁrst
few years. Second, consider the re-
turns. Money is important and
should be one consideration the CS-

teein and gratitude or the world is a

good crite ion at success. Tlii
choose a protession which will give
him opportunity for the greatest Dos
. hie usclulness to his fellow beings.
Choose where your utility is highest;
Fourth, one should choose a term of
activity in which he can put his
whole lilo "Lille your job.” and get
joy olit or doing it. Lastly, a man’s
life woil: sliolild he the main expres-
sion of his spiritual nature. He closed
by making a strong plea tor the Chris
tiau ministry and pointed out the great
advantages or it as a prolession. and
the need of trained men to do the
work.
