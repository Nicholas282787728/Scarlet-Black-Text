Chinese Minister
Unable to Appear
Before Convention

San-Kc Alfred Sze, Chinese am-
bassador to the United states, failed
,to appear on the program of the
Iowa social science convention last
night because of urgent business in
Washington, D. C.

It is probable that the recent
A'merichl-l response to the Japanese
declaration of policy in the Far East,
and the friendly attitude of the
United States toward China have re~
sulted in a situation which the am»
bassador found impossible to leave,
according to Fredrick L. Baumann,
associate professor of history.

The Chinese diplomat was re—
placed on the program by E. A.
Gilmore, acting president of. the
University of Iowa, who spoke Fri~
day night on “Law and Social
Sciences."

Between 100 and 115 social Scien»
tists attended the meetings of the
Iowa Poli cal Science association,
Iowa Historical association and the
Iowa Association of Economists and
Sociologists. .

Thirteen universities and colleges
were represented at the convention,
while teachers from a number of
junior colleges and public schools
throughout the state also attended.
Among the schools represented were:
Grinnell, Drake, Iowa State, Coe,
Comell, Simpson, Iowa State Teach-
ers, Iowa Wesleyan, Luther, Upper
Iowa, Buena Vista, Parsons, and the
University of Iowa.

At the various business sessions
held Saturday morning, the following
men \were elected presidents of the
three groups for the coming year; H.
W. Bohlman, Drake, Association of
Economists and Sociologists; Kirk H.
Porter, University of Iowa, Political
Science association; Knut Gjerset,

The races between Canard and

ing thosc by the town students, and
