Vienna Choir Boys
Arrive Next Friday;
Praised By Critics

The Vienna Choir Boys; tom'-
ing the U. s. for the first time
since 1933, will visit Grinnell next
Friday. Their performance at s
p. in. in the high school auditor-
ium will be the first of the Grin-
nell concert series.

The visiting Choir, composed of
over 20 boys, aged 3 to 15. was
organized in the year 1498 by
the Emperor Maximilian von
Hapsburg to sing in the Vienna
Court Chapel,

in the early 1700‘s the scope
of the Choir was broadened to
include folk songs and other
secular music; and today, in ad<
ditlon, it performs in costumed
operas of all nations.

By 1926, having survived World
“far I and ﬁle fall of the Hap:-
bugs, the Choir initiated tours
which took it throughout Europe,
singing in churches. public halls,
and opera choruses.

In 1932 The Chair was brought '

to this country for annual tours
which lasted until 1933. Those
tours were under the di ection of
Impresario s, Hurok, who brings
the Choir to the U. 5. now after
a ten-year absence.

Grinncll's head coach, “Bunny"
