Coming home A moment wzt/a Gar szt

by Bernadette Connors and
Robert Quashie

“It’s a quite subtle situation,
and requires much closer study
than I’ve been able to give in those
few months", says Coach Gar
Smith, 1963 graduate of Grinnell
College, upon returning after a
twenty-year absence to Coach
football as an assistant and
basketball as the head CDBCh.

His return was filled with ap
prehension. On one hand, sinith
looked forward to being back in
Grinnell's intellectually
stimulating and youdifui environ-
ment, yet he had heard rumors.
And talking to Smith one got the
feeling that he half-believed what
he heard.

Back in Smith’s student days of
1959 to 1963. Grinnell's student
body actively supported spore.
The stands at any given game
were packed, cheerleaders
elicited spirit from the crowds.
there were school ‘Fight’ songs
and yes. even a homecoming
queen.

Today, however, there is a
noticable lack of attendance at
some sporting events and Smith
had been warned that there was a
sense of animosity towards sports
on the campus.

In the days of Smith, students
lived in the same dorm for their
entire foursyear stint. He believes
that the changes in housing

Men’s Basketball

Playing before large and vocal
audiences at Darby Gymnasium,
the Pioneers surprised Iowa Con-
ference power Wartburg, 79-61,
and followed with an 84~30
Midwest Conference triumph over
Knox last Friday. The victories
halted a string of 13 setbacks, nine
of them on the road.

“We got off to tremendous
starts and maintained our
momentum throughout in the
Wartburg and Knox games,“
Coach Gar Smith stated, “We shot
and played about as well as we
can during the first in minues of
both contests." Smith also said
David Dorsey's return to form
played a big role in the Pioneer
surge. Dorsey started the last
three games and responded wth 48
points.

Playing one of the finest games
of his Grinnell career, Dennis Elyr
1y hit for 29 points, He hit 13 of 19
field goal attempts and was three
of three from the charity stripe.
Jim Niemeyer added 13 tallies
and pulled down 10 rebounds.
Steve Galster also grabbed 10 re
bounds. _,

Grinnell led Knox “>34 at the in- '

termission and was ahead 30-73
with two minutes left. Knox quick»
1y cut the difference to 80-78, but
four clutch [reethrows by Galster
during the final 45 seconds
preserved the victory.

Not even scoring 50 points in the
second half was enouth to put the
Grinnell College men’s basketball
team above the Illinois College
Blueboys, who defeated the
Pioneers 94-87 before a large but
disappointed crowd in Darby
Gymnasium Saturday.

Afer being down 43-37 at
halfitrne, the Pioneers moved
ahead twice in the second half but
couldn’t hang onto the lead. “We
had the opportunities,” Smith
Said, “but we didn‘t convert.”

policies may have hurt team sup-
port because the arrangement
engendered a strong sense of com-
raderie and unity. Hallmates
would support each other.

Smith had heard of a new
‘Selfishness’. “I doubt anyoneiis
more individualistic than me and
most of my classmates were."
(We don’t doubt that either —
Smiﬁi has the same haircut he had
in 1962). But he disapproves of the
lack of cooperation among
students which he believes has
grown on campus,

Some students, for example,
don’t respect other Students’
needs to express themselves
through sports. Smith does not
deny finding this problem to be
true, now that he has arrived.

Smith notes that the lack of ef-
fective teamwork on the football
and basketball teams has been a
big problem. but both teams jelled
at the ends of their seasons, The
main problem as he assessed it.
was that the players worried too
much about their individual per
formance rather than concens
tratlng on winning, as a team.

Since his days as a student, the

attitude about sports has changed.‘

Smith doesn‘t agree with all of
these changes but he realizes that
all of his fears were not substans
tiated, and believes that the sports
atmosphere at Grinnell is actually
looking brighter.

The first comesfrom behind rals
1y was sparked by a aspoint play
by John Schulz and Dennis Blyly‘s
aggressive playing. 31ny put the
Pioneers on top 54-53 with 14
minutes left in the game.

After losing their brief lead, the
Pioneers caught up again with
good inside playing from Scholz
and Mike Neely. Jim Niemeyer
put the Scarlet and Black ahead
with seven minutes left, [66-65, but
iilinois College regained the lead
and held on for the rest of die
game.

The Pioneers’s performance
was highlighted by good inside
play from Steve Galster and Jim
Neimeyer, who led the Pioneers in
rebounds, and David Dorsey’s ag-
gressive defensive play.
Niemeyer and 131ny led Grinnel in
scoring ,with 18 points apiece,
while ‘Galaster netted l7 and
Dorsey added 14.

The message that the basketball
team expressed was mat they
would Pluck the Peacocks and
they did just that. The Pioneers
defeated Upper-Iowa University
and entertained a fullhouse to the
tune of 10079.

The crowd was held on the edge
of its seat when, in the final four

minutes, Coach Gar Smith pulled ~

the starters and gave the backups
the chance to light up that last
zero. And it took them the entire
four minutes to do so. A freethrow
by freshman Darryl Scott in the
last fifty seconds was needed for
the Pioneers to reach the magic
number.

Women’s Basketball

Playing at Darby Gymnasium
for the first time in nearly two
months, the Grinnell College
women's basketball team treated
the home fans to a come»from-
behind 60753 victory over Clarke
Saturday. The Pioneers, who had
dropped eight straight road con-
tests since the holiday break,
trailed Clarke 58-56 with a minute
remaining.

by Robert Quashie
in his day, it was a school of
high spirits, as some would say,
with lots of ‘rah-rah' enthusiasm;
now Coach Gar Smith views Grinv
nell as a school in transition. Grins
nell’s immediate past and the
reputation which now precedes its
name, is that it has been a school
dead set against any show of in
terest or enjoyment of any sport
more competitive than solitaire.
He sees in the near future a mov-
ing away form the selfish ats
titudes of the recent past to a new
understanding of the ideals of co-
operation and group support.

If we agree with Coach Smith,
and I do, we have to say that, yes,
overly zealous and almost
hypocritical attitudes about in-
dividualism have done a great
harm to the Grinnell College com~
munity.

Not only do we see this manifest
in sports but in the decline of
political and social activism on
this Campus. Grinnell was labeled
a hotbed before the sixties, so why
should it not be after that time?
But. this is the sports page so back
to sports.

First. for the teams themselves.
Most of our ‘major teams‘ have
losing records and many have
blamed this on a lack of talent.
This is Division III, you don't need
talent. Speaking from personal
experience, the football team has
been so torn with egoswars that it
is a wonder that we wore the same
uniforms. But something strange
happened at the end of the season.
All of the players put aside their
personal differences and guess
what, we won.

Deb Eastman knotted the score
with a basket at the 0:55 mark and
reserve Alexandra Hoffman pro
vided the winning margin with a
pair of freethrows in the final 22
seconds.

The Pioneers return to road ac-
tion this weekend, facing lowé
Wesleyan at 7 pm, tonight at Mt.
Pleasant and Monmoudl at 5:320
pm. Saturday, Feb, 11 at Mon
mouth, Ill. The next home ap»
pearance will be a Monday, Feb.
13, encounter with Marshailtown.
It's set for 6:15 pm at Darby

‘ Guyrn.

Coach Cathie Schweitzer called

‘the Clarke game “Grinnell’s best

since the holdiay break." She
said, ”We shot better from the
field and also played one of our
best defensive games." Firing in
10 of 15 shots from the field,
Eastman led the Pioneers with 22
points. Liz Schumacher added 11,
Becky Rate l20 and Hoffman nine.

Earlier in the week, the Scarlet
and Black dropped a 57-43
Midwest Conference decision at
Knox and a 33721 nonsloop affair at
Wartburg.

This semester we have watched
our basketball team re-group
from a Christmas break disaster
to upset two teams. John Schulz
said that the only thing they did
differently was to play together:
“when you screwed up, someone
was there, when you did good so
meone was there.”

This is the change which Coach
Smith sees coming. I don’t believe
that he is looking for the return of
Buffy the glee girl. Grinnell was
not built by individuals so
dedicated to self expression that
they disregarded their fellow
human. Hopefully this new and
‘dangerous’ attitude of winning
and cooperation may spread
from the athletes to the rest of the
campus community,

In fact, it may already have.\
Tonight we are going to have a
pep-band at the basketball game.
It will not and should not rival
anything we might see at other
schools, but it does show that
students want to cheer and they
want to support their teams; they
want to have fun.

To those of you who fear that_
our fair Grinn City may turn into
another Iowa City, I say don’t
worry. No one here wants to be a
rah-rah or Joe Jock itch. The
student/athletes and those of us
who like to cheer, just want to say
that, “i can do that and be myself
too”. What’s more liberal than
