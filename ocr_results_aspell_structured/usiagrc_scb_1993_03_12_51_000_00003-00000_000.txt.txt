and Thelnstantfels practice in Harris. Also the Harris Center
has a small equipment room where bands can store ampliﬁ-
ers, drum sets, and other stuff.

Fine Arts Room 106 is another place to practice. The
advantage of Fine Arts 106 is the availability or the college
drum set. Bands whose drummer takes dmm lessons, like
Portia Sabin in [lavelinal can borrow the drum set out of the

The basement or off-campus houses is a popu-
lar option. Bands can arrange to leave their
equipment in the basement ofa house and prac-
tice on a ﬂexible schedule. This way bands can
leave their equipment set up and don’t have to
take it down after every practice. The Past-Men
practice in the basement of a house but Armon
Kasmal mentioned that he feared that he and the
other members or The Post-Men might go deaf
practicing in such a small space.

Then there is kvali‘burthat simply does not go
through the hassle of practicing.

How do you join a band?

People who are interested in playing in a band
usually ﬁnd other people by word ofmouth or by
going to concerts. But it usually takes a long time
to get a band together.

But now Aaron Kassover has recently formed a
student organization called Bands Of Musicians.
Bands is a resource for people who are playing or
want to be playing in bands.

Still in the planning stages, Bands’ main goal
is to get the Grinnell band scene more organized.
Bands also plans to organize all-campus events
featuring solely campus bands.

lason Elbogen of The Shepherd Kings com-
mented an a possibility: "I think maybe a way to
ﬁght [the Harris Center disaster] would be to have a bi-weekly or weekly
band showcase on Saturday night or something."

This is exactly what Bands intends to do. Bands intends to create a
forum where musicians and band members can talk, plan, exchange
thought, swap licks, and simply get together.

So iryou want to make a change in the Grinnell College music
scene, send your comments, thoughts, ideas and input to [ti/mus]

Due the large size of the Harris Center Concert Hall, it has proven to
be suitable only {or reputable non-college bands, like Consolidated. Crowds in
