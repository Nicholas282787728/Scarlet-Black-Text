Grinnell, satin ny mu- 29. )897.

AT LAST, after eight years of
close and exciting competitions
between the colleges of the Iowa
Inter- Collegiate Association, the
cup so long siriven for, has come
to Grinnell to stay. Five of these
years it has been in the possession
of Grinnell, at one time being held
tivo years in succession, only again
to be lost to S. U. I. But at last
by dint of hard work and concien-
tious training on the part of the
Grinnell track teams the trophy
has been received and will remain
a permanent posession of the colr
lege. Too much can not be said
in praise of the members of the
teams who, though often opposed
by adverse circumstances, have
kept heart and striven each to do
his best in his individual part.
Never before has Grinnell had a
better allraround track team. and
never before has she won a meet
with more ease against formidable
rivals than yesterday. The great
merit of Grinnell athletes has been
shown more prominently than ev»
er this year in the two meets just
held, namely: steady, persistent
training. This, coupled with the
“Grinnell spirit," has accounted
for many victories in the pastand
wehopewillcontinue todosointhe
future. In addition to this, ill con-
sidering the two victories of the
last week, great thanks are due to
Mr, Watson, the track team train
er, tor the careful, earnest attenr
tion he has given to developing
the weal: points of the team and
for the prime condition in which
he has kept every man, As a
trainer Grinnell has never had his
equal and he will always be re
membcred as being one of the
main contribitors to one of Grin-
nell's greatest victories.
