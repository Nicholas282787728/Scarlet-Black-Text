with pastoral types; (4) characters
[award/ism, so to speak, by the
magic of the forest of Arden.

lii tlic ﬁrst group are “\lViIllam,”
“Audrey” and "Corill." Mr.
Coggcslialrs “William" was good;
Miss Hand's “Audrey” smacked
ot the soil, and \vcllrexprcsscd the
uncouth innocence of a genuine
rustic. Mr. Leonard interpreted
~Coiin.“ In general bearing and
specially in elocution he was nota-
bly succcsstiil, showing excellent
appieciatioii of thc mingled SllTl~
plicity and ripened wisdom or this
half licl'nlitrlike character.

"Phoebe" ltnd “Silvius” are stud-
ies in caricature. Miss Morrison's
"I’llmbe" was pOSSibly a bit too
serious. but she was distinct from
all other characters. Mr. Peirce
as a crude country boot in love,
was full of life. His acting ranked
with the best of the evening, and
it was rewarded by an amused and
eager audience, Both the sltepr
herds wet-e silly enough to attain
Shakespeare's object~ridicule of
the lamous Renaissance pastoral
crazc.

Resistance to the inﬂuence of

demic costume and grave notions
“iound;" in the Touchstone, Jac»
ques, and the courtiers, too cruel
or too fashionable to be changed
by country lite. Touchstone was
a miracle of motion, mental and
physical. Possibly Mr. Spatilding
did not quite express the deeper
meaning or such passages as
”Truly, Shepherd, in respect, it
they, etc.," biit his general conr
ceptions were good, his sport with
William and Audrey specially
good. Mr. Dennison interpreted
the French cottrti‘er Le Beau, by
excellent language. accent.and by
pesticiilntion lull or meaning even
when he was a speechless member
or a group. The selection of Mr.
Brown for the salient and comr
plexcharactct‘ol Jacques was a
fortunate one. The dilettantc
phases of the capiicious melan-
clloly were rnihcr better noticed
than those based on the deeper
selﬁshness and immorality ol lac.
qiies' nature.

 

Mr. Douglass and Mr. Roberts
played respectively the parts of
Frederick, the usurplng duke, and

Mi. Lyman was the only member
or the company who attempted
two chatitcterizati‘oits, His “Adr
am" was a ﬁne rendt‘rlng ol the
\vellrpl'escrved old man, and the
faithful, affectionate lainily serv-
ant of the old feudal type.

Mr. Fisher played Orlando;
Miss Hartwell. Celia; Miss Knox.
Rosalind. The “burden and heat"
of the play were ably sustained
by all three. Miss Hartwell's ac
tion was not a more second to that
of Rosalind, but had its own indie
viduality. Mr. Fisher as a valiant
youth, a languishing lover. a gen-
el‘ous master, seemed equally sucs
cessful, Miss Knox had to a large
dcgreethc variety, the vivacity.
the wit. the delicacy underlying
an assumed boldness that make
Rosalind an immortal delight to
the eye and the ear and the imagi~
nation.
