Conference in Chlcago.

On Friday, Nov. 28, faculty
members irorn Chicago, Wisconr
sin. Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois,
Northwestern and Purdue met at
Chicago. The object of the meetr
ing was the adoption of a set of
uniform athletic rules which
should be binding on all the coir
leges named above. The formar
tion of a league, composed of the
principle universities of the west
was discussed. but deﬁnite action
was deferred until a future date.
llliiiuis’ representative was the
most radical present. while Wis-
consin proved to be the stumbling
block. The session was a very
stormy one and the chances are
that the present unsettled condir
tion in athletics wtll continue.

The following rules were ﬁnally
adopted subject to action of the
several colleges in the league.

1. No one shall participate in
