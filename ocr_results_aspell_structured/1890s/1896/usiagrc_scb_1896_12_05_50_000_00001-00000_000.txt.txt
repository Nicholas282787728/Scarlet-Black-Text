Basket Ball Game,

Thc cottage basket ball team
was defeated by the team repre
senting the other girls otthe Cole
lege, in aclosely contested gameat
the Armory this morning,the ﬁnal
score standing 36 to 25. This was
the second game between these
teams, and the ﬁrst which the gene
eral public has been permitted to
witness. A large number of spec
tators were present. who were en-
thusiastic in their appreciation or
the game. The interest shown
this morning betokens a popular
ity for the game equal to that of
any as yet introduced into the
college.

The college team started in with
a rush and quickly scored six
points on goals by Misses Knox
and Corrough. Miss Bowen won
the ﬁrst three points for the cot-
tage by a well thrown goal and
Misses Corrough and \thyte re
peated the play for their re
spective sides. Scores on touls
ﬁxed the points at 10—10, and Miss
Bowen put the cottage in the
lead [or the ﬁrst hall by’ another
goal.

The second half witnessed some
ﬁne work by both sides. The
play in the early part ot this half
was close and neither side seemed
able to gain a decided advantage.
but the college team by 'a spirited
rally won out by a considerable
margin. Some remarkably quick
and accurate work was done at the
center of the floor, calling [orth
continuous applause from the side
lines. Misses Knox and Wllytc
were cheered enthusiastically for
several accurate goal throws from
The college team se-
cured 26 points this half while the
cottage team was counting i2,
giving the game to the former by
a score of 36725. The college
scored 9 and the cottage 7 on
fouls. Three of the college goals
and two (or the cottage were from
line throws on fouls.

 

Every member of both teams
deserves some mention for bril-
liant plays as well as tor steady
and consistent work from ﬁrst to
last Miss Whytc deserves par»
ticular mention for her work at
the bil‘akﬁ‘. Miss Whitman exr

sprained ankle compelled her to
quit the game. followed the ball
in splendid style and aided the
college team materially. Miss
Hubbard by sure catches and long
throws did much toward keeping
the college basket out of danger.
The team work of the cottage was
as a whole superior. but they could
not successfully resist the aggress
