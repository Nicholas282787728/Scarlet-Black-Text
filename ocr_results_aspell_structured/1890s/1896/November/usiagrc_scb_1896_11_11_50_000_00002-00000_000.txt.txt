EVERY MAN and item iii in school
should be out to the game Satuir
day, to encourage the men on to
greater ettort. The games have
not been patronized this year as
they should be. and “is would like
to see the whole school out (or
once. The attendance at practice
is poor. Norieot the women have
been to see the boys play tor over
a month; when we bad games
here they did not attend. Let us
show the s U. I. people that on.
girls are just as loyal as theirs art:

THE CONDUCT ot the Missouri
team and synlpathizers at their
recent game with S U. 1, cannot
be condemned too harshly. It
was unsportsmanlike in the ex
treme. It is to such occurrences
as this that the opponents of foot-
ball are indebted for their argue
inerits against the game and the
casein question will add much to
the justice of their cause. ifsuch
occurrences are to be repeated the
future of the game can no longei
be in doubt. But fortunately this
oneis an exception. Never be.
fore in the history of football has
it been necessary to stop '4 game
to avert bloodshed, and iii the inr
terests at college sport, such a
thing must never be repeated
True sportiiiaiisliip as well as inn
and order demand that such ar-

rangenieiits be made as to lendei‘

a repetition impossible.
