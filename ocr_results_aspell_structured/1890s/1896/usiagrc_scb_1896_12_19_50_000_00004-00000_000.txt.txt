thought of his oration:

Glance at modern conditions.
One by one the undying truths of
ethics and religion have been
grasped and bodied torth in hu
man life. The coordination of
action with the highest achieve
ments of faith. intuition and reas
on, isbelng accomplished. The
dark fatalism of Homer and A35-
chylus pales betore the triums
pliant faith of Milton and Tenny-
son. Conscience asserts its sover-
eighty and mind rcjoiccs in its
true liberty." The subject mat-
ter was illustrated at different
points by references to great men
whose lives have aided humanity.
The closing sentences “'ere well
delivered by the orator: "Thus
this principle of mutual assistance
of man to his fellows, receives
divine sanction through history,
it stirs hero’s blood, and it indeed
ranks ﬁrst among the virgin ins
stincts of the soul. What means
this foursfold vision of duty from
history, biography, nature and
