AXNOLACLMENT has been made
to the reflect that in future no
marks or standings \\‘lll be given
out lrom the president's ofﬁce.
Whether the in vidllal members
at the faculty trill glve uny infttr»
matron on this subject or not rests
entirely with them to decide, The
present system or marking has
long been recognized as tar tronr
taultless, but though many at»
tempts have been made, success
has not crowned the efforts to
evolve something better. Ale
though no direct inlor-mation is
available, it is generally under
stood that the present action is
but a step toward inaugurating an
entire change.

our gymnasium offers a subtittite
that ii rightly used will go a long
way toward satislying the need.
