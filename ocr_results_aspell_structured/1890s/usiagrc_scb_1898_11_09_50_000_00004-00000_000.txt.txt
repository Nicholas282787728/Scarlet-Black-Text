In the football game ivitli Penn
College last Saturday some would
have wished a larger score since
the Penn team'heietotorc has not
been couSideied a veiy strong one.
The score however is of little con»
sequence so long as we won the
game. The hope and indeed the
expectation ofalarger score was
expressed before the game. btit
on account ot Penn’s previous
reputation football, and the
consequent underestimate of her
strength.

This reputation OI lack of repu-
tation is probably iiglitly so. but
if present appearences are any
criterion it is not to be so in the
Farm has made a differ
ent remand this year than ever be-
fore. Glinnoll found in her a
ivoi thy opponent and otherteams
have found the same, notably the
Monmouth team. It is true that
in Saturday’s game the Griniiell
men were somewhatdazed in the
ﬁrst half and did not play the
gamcthoy were capable of. but
this was due to the unlocked for
strength and knowledge of the
gamedisplayed by Penn's men:
Griniiell came together in the
last haltand played a strong or.
fensive and detsnsive game and
found even then that they had to
tight forevery yard they won. If
Penri keeps up the gait they have
taken this season she will bea
factor by no means unimportant
in Iowa football.

The game, however. was a very
disastrousoneforGrinnellbecause
oi having her men crippled. This
is the worst game in this respect
that we have encountered this
year. Caprori, our best gnard.
had his elbow dislocated and will
be out of the game for the re»
mainder of the season.

game. Foster had three of his

broken and consequently cannot

Obviously the loss of these men,
all of whom are valuable ones,
will \vealtcn Grinnell. Those who
have been sanguine as tolier pros

remnindel'oflhc season may do
well to harbor a few doubts on
that subject.

A comparative i-eVieiv of this
year's score at the two tennis

uncertain and one cannot icly

U. I. has good material, and the
dcfeals she has already suffered
do much to whip her into
shape to meet the team she most
desiies to boat. We anticipate a
good game. and while we hope to
win and think our hope has some
grounds. it is not a sure thing.

afford to miss this game, the only
big one on the home grounds and
one of the most inipmtaiit of the
season. For this same ieason the
people oi Grinnell who are the
least interested in football wlll
ieel amply repaid tor attending
