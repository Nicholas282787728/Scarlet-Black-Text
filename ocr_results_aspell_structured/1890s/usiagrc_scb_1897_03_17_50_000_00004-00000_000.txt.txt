the dashes. Against him will be
Mayherry, at Wisconsin, and out
own Rush. who are to run under
the colors oi tlle Chicago Athletic
Association and to receive
special training for the effort to

~ ‘l\Iayberry and Rush will wear
the cherry circle in the charity
tournamctit.‘ said Mr. Stone yesr
terday. ‘The boys have become
members of our club and Will train
under our auspices. lliayberry I
consider the greatest sprinter for
100 yards that I have seen in this
country, and I do not think that
during the long experience I have
had in athletics I have ever had a
more promising athlete. He is
well ﬁtted to run against the
great \Vclcrs.

“ “Rush is ﬁtted [or any distance
up to and including a quarter of a
mile. He may prove in time
even a bettel man than the Bad

Neither has been properly

Ad for their contests and I
hink proper preparatory work

time. Mayberry coveled two
consecutive heats of the iooyards
here at the western intercollegiate
games lit o:l0. He has a mark of
0:09 475 at Madison, which is the
acknowledged world‘s record.
Rush has done 0:10 and has an
equally good mark for 22o yards,

Stagg’s Contest with the A. A. ll.

As a result of the indoor meet
held by the University of Chicago
in conjunction with the First Regs
iment Athletic Club a week ago,
Prof. Stagg ﬁnds lrirrrseli in open

 

conilict with the authorities of the
Amateur Athletic Union.

At their meeting this last win-
ter the A. A. U. adop‘ted a rule
that all amateur athletes bctorc
competing in open mcct
should be registered, [or which
registration they should pay a tee
of SI 00. On the ground that the
meet referred to was not an open
meet Prof. Stagg neglected to
have his men registered. As a
rcsrlltall the candidates for the
Chicago University Track team
are disqualiﬁed. Prof. Stagg pros
poses to ﬁght it out with the A.
A. U., and has asked the other
members of the Western Intercolr
lcgiate Association to back him
up. In a statement in the C/lz'mgr
Dior/rm ot March r5. rrot. Stagg
states his position. Owing to the
[act that the W. I, C. A. A. has
been allowed no representatives
at the meeting at which the rule
was adopted, he does not consider
it binding. On the other hand
he considers it an unwarranted as

any

Sumption or control over wesie_rrr
colleges and universities.

Cross Country Runs.

The runs across country, which
were indulged in last spring by
the longrdistance runners. proved
such an efﬁcient method of train-
ing that the track management
has dealded to follow the same
plan this year, and all candidates
desiring to participate slrotild
meet at the gymnasium at 3:00
o'clock r, ii. Saturday. The bells
eﬁt to be derived from this meth-
od of training by thelongrdistance
men is quite evident. while it is
yet so early in the season that
participation iii them will not be
without beneﬁt to the middlerdisr
tance runners. The arrangements
have not yet been completed in
regard to the choice of’hares, but
will be made of
that, later in the week at the gynr
itasium,
