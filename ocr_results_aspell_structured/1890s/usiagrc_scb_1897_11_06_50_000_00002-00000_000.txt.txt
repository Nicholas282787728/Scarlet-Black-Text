car 9 a(Kitlniversity and lowaStnte College,
which was played at Iowa City
yesterday, was a very ﬁne contest

and torth up and down the ﬁeld
with honors about even until 5. U.
I. succeeded in CIl'cling Ames' end
for a touch-down, ﬁfteen minutes
atter play began. Goal was missr
ed. That ended the scoring in the
nrsthalt, though each goal was
several times in danger. ' In the
