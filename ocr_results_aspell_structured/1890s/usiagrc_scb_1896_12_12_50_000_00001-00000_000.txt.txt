The ’96 Team.

The tearrr has worked to a dis-
advantage this season in agood
many ways, One of the most ser
nous drawbacks was the nbsctice
of Captain 'l‘ernplcmarr rrorn his
position and a great part of the
time from the practice ﬁeld. The
loss ot his leadership rvas incalcur
lable but at times when lie was
able to be otrt at practice and
coach, he was both an i 'piration
to the men and a severe and jtrst
critic. He returned to school this
fall with a slight malarial indispo-
sition which prevented his being
out the ﬁrst week ot practice. He
rvent into the Minnesota game
however, received
slight injury. But according to
tire doctors this was not responsir
ble tor his inability to play during
the season. His malaria returned
and prevented his again putting
on his moleskins.

Sketches from the Scarside of
Holland were given by Miss
Southworth. Her work was carer
fully prepared and her reading
very pleasing,

Miss Manning then favored the
society with a piano solo, which
was heartily \vclcomed.

The Picturesque in Holland was
gir'en by Miss Fellows, in an in»
teresting, well written paper.
Miss Fellows' choice of words in
descriptions is to be commended,
She spoke or the peculiar atmos

The meeting of Calocagathia
was opened yesterday afternoon
with a very pleasing vocal solo by
Miss Patten. Miss Arnold then
gave an illustratéd lecture on

interesting. She took as her subr

one in attendance at Grrnnell, and
with her audience followed him

At an carlv Ironr last evening
small crowds of people were seen
making their way to the Stone
church. and sometime before the
hour. every scat in the house was
ﬁlled, and all the available stand-
ing roonr taken. The crowd at-
tested in many ways to the im-
popularity Mr. Powers
gained here last year and the
eager antrcipations with which his
appearance has been awaited this
fall.

Mr, Powers had chosen Charles
Dickens' lnastcl'piccc. David Copr
perhcld for the subject of his imr
personatrons. All the most inr-
portant characters were well ins
troduced in the [our acts into
which Mr. Powers had divided the
work. The entertainer appeared
perhaps most successtully in inr
terpreting the characters and ap.
