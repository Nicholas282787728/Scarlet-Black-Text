During the recent meeting of
the State Teachers Association.
at Des Moines. representatives
from the ﬁfteen recognized Cole
leges of the state met at the call

. of President Eastman.“ Upper-

To start the ball rolling. l’ml.
Hendrixson read the rules adopt-
ed by the western s.
and also those adopted by the
eastern institutions, The rules
of the Amateur Athletic Union
were also read. Alter some (lisp
Cussion. a motion was made by
Professor Helidrixson to the
effect that the Amateur Athletic
Union rules should be adopted to
govern the athletics of all the
Iowa Colleges, with the provision
distinctly made and so understood
that the rules should not be retror
active. The State University tlel-
cgates were not in favor of this
motion. and were very strenuous
in their opposition. Affairs were
rapidly approaching a crisis. some
of the delegates being in tavor 0t
passing the rules without the co-
operation of the University. when
Professor Hendrixson, in the in-
terest of harmony. arose and mov-
ed that Professor Sims, of that iri~
stitution. be made a committee of
one to draw up such rules as he
deemed suitable to the needs of
the colleges of Iowa. and make a

univelsit

 

report by the last of January.

meeting adjourned urth the inat-
ter- so pending.

The Mills Lectures.

B. Fay Mills will give three
lectures in Griitnell on the present
crisis:

I. The Social Peril.

Ii. What must Society do to
be saved?

11], The
Chr-r- ianity.

These lectures will be given in
the Congregational Church on the
evenings of Saturday. January 9.
Monday and Tuesday, January
it and l2.

Mr. Mills has never before con-
sentcd to appear upon the lecture
plaitornr, hut this year he is de-
livering this special message in
this way.

He comes to Grinnell. its he has
(lone before. by special invitation.
The admission to this course is
put at popular prices, lower than
in most cities when: he goes In
order that none need be prevented
ironr hearirg lnrn. Course tick-
ets. for 45 cents. admitting to all
of the three lectures may be ob-
tained at McConnell's. Single
lectures will be 20 cents.

Mr. Mills needs no introduction
to Grinnell people nor to the pear

pic at America generally. No
man of his generation has moved
more protoundly for good more
people than he in his preaching
to all the churches of our land
during the last ﬁfteen years. He
regards the message oi these lcctr
tires as equally important with the
preaching of tormer years. Tlrey
are the expression ot his ripest
thought. There are no more live
topics. He never speaks but as a
man rvrth a rn age. The only
object in char‘ g any atlnr ~‘
tee is that he cannot do this work
and pay his own expenses and
supporta tamily.
