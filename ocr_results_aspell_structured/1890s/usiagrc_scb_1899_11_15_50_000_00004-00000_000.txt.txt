ence and when there was any the
man for whom It was intended
usually preferred to leave it and
rutl straight into the arms of some
waiting Stinpsoman, to be thrown
tor a loss. The linc did not seem,
to have any holding powcrs. and
Simpson men continually sittcd
through and spoiled plays betore
they were started. The favorite
style or tnclding was around the
neck. and a man usually made two
or thl'ce yards after being tackled.

The Simpson men played well,
although hanlpcrcd by a lack of
knowledge of the game. Captain
Kennedy was in every play and
made some good tackles, Simpr
son played with but low tumbles,
which is more than Grinnell can
say, and the tackles, ends and
backs all made good gains. The
guards and tackles lrequently
opened good holcs in thc oppos»
ing line.

THE GAME.

Grinncll kicked off from the
north side and Drain returned [5.
Simpson hustled the ball up the
ﬁeld on gains ot from 4 to to
yards, and added 20 yards on a
take kick which ought to have
been stopped for a loss. Grinnell
took the ballon downs in her own
territory,'lost ground, and Burd
punled 30 yards. Grinnell soon
took the ball on downs but again
failed to gain, and Burd punted
out of bounds for 20 yards, Simp-
son advanced as before by short
gains. aided by the off-side play
of Grinnell. and time was called
with the ball on Grinncll's 15-yard
line.

SECOND HALF.

Simpson kicked off, and Burd
returned the ball almost to the
center of the ﬁeld by the best run
of the day. Grinnell advanced
the ball, mostly through the line

 

and Burd puniod 35 Simpson
tnmblcd and Grinncll regained
the ball, The ball was now on
sirnpson'szo yard line and Wheat
er dropped back Iol a drop hick,
bllt Kennedy was ul’frsitle. and
Simpson penalized for 10
yards. On the next play Lindsay
went for a touchdown.
Wheeler missed goal.

Grinnell, 5; Simpson, 0.

Simpson kicked off, and Lindr
say Iumblcd the catch, but Dongs
lass saved the ball. Knapp and
Burd advanced a iew yards, but

the ball was lost on a tumble on
Grinnell's 25-yard line. ISysthr
cessive gains through the line,
Simpson advanced the ball to the
5-yard line. Here Grinnell braced
and took the ball one {not Ironl
her goal. Btlrd dropped back to
punt, but the pass went over his
head. He recovered the ball, and
as the gentlemen tiom Simpson
were kind enough not to molest
him, he punied out 25 yards.
Grinnell soon took the ball on
downs. and after Fiske had lost
5 yards on the quarter-back pass,
Burd puntcd 30 yards. Simpson
lost 20 yards in attempting to
punt and returned the ball. Flske
went out and was replaced by
Foster. Simpson made in yards
on a trick play and to more by
buclring. they then tried a goal
from ﬁeld, but the pass was wlld
and Grinnell obtained the ball.
On the next play Smith picked up
the ball after it was downed, and
ran 40 yaids for a touclbdmvnbul
the play was not allowed. Time
was called with the ball in Grill-
nell's possession in the middle of
the Field.
