Spelling Reform,
colleges and universities
where of necessity so tnuch of the
instruction is by the lecture metlr
od, the large majority of students
who write in “longrhand” are cums
pelted to invent for themselves a
system of abbreviations. They
discover very soon the tiuth of
the statement tllat “English spells
ing is the worst in the world.”

Mnny‘of tlle alumni will recall
that not many years ago one of
the members of the faculty of Iowa
College, now no longer among us,
was an ardent apostle of "Spelling
Refawrm.” In those days to take
such a position was equivalent to
being a "crank," as tew people
really accepted the demands of
the Spoiling Reformers seriously.
It is perhaps true that in the early
stages of this agitation, in com-
mon with similar periods of other
reforms, the demands involved
too sweeping a change. of late
years. hottever, the attitude of the
world in general toward this ques—
tion has changed; and ﬁnding it
vastly to their advantage, many
newspapers and journals or recog
nized worth have accepted and
adopted in greater or less degree
the six rules recommended by the
American Philologtcal Associae
tion appended below.

An examination of this list wtll
show how eminently reasonable
ate the demands made by the As-
sociation, and. it is to be hoped,
will bring some lcw to an accep-
tance of them.

It is said that the scholarship of
the world is almost a unit in der
mandtng a change at our illogical
system of orthography. What
better 'method than by following
these few simple rules?

Leland T. Powers.

No number in past lecture
courses in Grinncll has been heard
with more enjoyment than Mr.
Leland T. Powers, Impersonator.
Although Mr. Powersdoesnot zip»
pear in this city this year, the H17
telest in him is still sufﬁcient to
iustity us in clipping irom a recent
popular magazine the following
short autobiography:

~th boyhood tvas passed in Pal.
myra, Western New York, andI
wanted to be a civil engineer.
Stern Fate thwarted this laudable
ambition and made an impersona
tor of me. After working awhile
as a printer. in 1875.1 went to
Boston, having Lle’icrluiiitd to go
on the stage. and with that end in
view began studying at the Mons
roe school at oratory. While
there, I discovered that I pass
sessed the knack ot changing my
face and voice to suit different
characters. .I soon decided. for
reasons of no interest here, not to
try the stage, but to do reading
andrecitation. Atthatperioditn-
personation was conﬁned chieﬂy
to classic drama or old-time comr
edy, acted by men like Richard-
son and Riddle. It struck me
that success awaited any one who
would do the same line of work
in a more popular vein.

“Aflerleaving school Idid read-
ing at the conventional type,
meanwhile clot-king in \Nai'd &
Gay's bookstore, Boston. putting
in my spare time on getting up
Toni Robertson's ‘David Garrick '

My detached readings met with ‘

some success, but managers and
public apparently wanted none ot
my dramatic impersonation. I
stuck to it, however, and eventu-
ally converted the skeptics who
did not think ‘one man could do
it all.‘ got a foothold, and ﬁnally
Redpath's bureau took me up.
From that time the popularity of
this kind of entertainment was as
sured; ‘Iismerelda' and ‘David
Copperﬁeld were in time added
to my repertoire. and now eight
men are doing the same line of
work. Ihave nine plays on my
list."

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1898.

Grinnell Institute.

Last Saturday’s snowy weather
cast somewhat of a damper upon
the meeting of the Institute. but
all things considered, a program
of a good deal of interest was
carried out.

Laybourn. under the title. "A
Lay sermon." gave an interesting
discussion of the student uprising
in Paris.

The society then listened to a
vocal solo by Parish, and would
have been very glad to listen to
more, but circumstances did not
permit an encore.

Booker T. Washington was dis
cussed by Campbell. who emphar
sized some phases of his charaCr
ter and work suggested by his re
cent visit to Grinnell.

In the externporaneous work,
Whitney gave an excellently
worded talk on “Gladstone,“
crandall very seasonably spoke
on "JuniorAnnuals," and Stephen
expressed his views as to whether
the abolition of examinations
would be advisable.

Smith then told the society all
he knew about current events.
which brought the program to the
regular debate. The subject un-
der discussion was “Resolved. that
a high tax should be laid on all
immigrants to the United States."
The aFﬁrmative was supported
by Frisbie and Brown. the negar
tive by Engelke and Halsey. The
debaters were hampered to some
extentbyapoorsubject,buttiearly
all showed caretnl preparation.
Layhourn volunteered on the air
ﬁrmative, and Campbell on the
negative Roberts gave the critr
ic's report, after which the chair
summed up the debate and den
clded it in favor of the negative.
