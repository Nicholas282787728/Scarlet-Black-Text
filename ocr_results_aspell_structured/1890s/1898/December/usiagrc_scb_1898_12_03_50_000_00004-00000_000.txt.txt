In our last is tie it was statctl
tliatAmesantlDrah-ewcietheonly
institutions that claimed the state
tootball CllttmpluiIShlp, This “(is
a mistake, Notices of the cham-
[)itynSlllp being won by otheri
teams are continually attracting
our attention. The juggling with
words and ﬁgures shown in these
ltollces is remarkable and “otlld
tend to Show either that none
has a valid claim to the champion-
ship or that there are nearly as
many Statecilampionships in Iowa
as there are teams.

The claims of Lenox College
art: given in the clipping below
and are in the same line astlle re
port that was current during the
season to the effect that Ames,
Lenox and the State Normal
were to play oft the cllztmpiom
ship. The grounds were that the
big teams had refused to play the
ﬁrst two and the last had defeated
S. U. I.

A Word of Protest.

Ed. Iowa Capital. Can you ﬁnd
space for the following facts?

Since April t the management
of the football team has been enr
deavoring to arrange tor a galne‘
ot football with three or four
other Iowa collegesclaiining to be
at the top in the football world of
Iowa, viz: State University,

l

 

,abeve expenses; State University

Drake, Grlnnell and Antes, but all
in vain; Drake claiming her
Schedule to be ittll, Gliltnell
would not say anything and re»
lusrtlg to come [til a bonus ut550

ltcpt mum and would not recog-
IllZC a challenge; Atncs. arter cone
steerable delay, notiﬁed us that
they would play tot-expenses and
550, in all about $175. The offer
was accepted by citizens of Monte
icelio and also by the Lenoxteam,

and no sooner weiethey accepted ‘

than they blurted and notiﬁed us
that they would not play. The
facts otthe case are these: They
never intended to play and
thought to get out by asking
prices that they thought could
not be raised. Lenox has a team
that she knows would win. and is
not afraid to back the enterprise.
Lenox tendered them a game on
either grounds anti also on neutral
grounds, and at any time they
might wish. Lenox is a school of
the first rank and has always
played good football. She has
received recognition troin schools
our of the state superior to any of
these, and her scores against
teams that have met all will come
pare with any of‘ them. If they
deem Lenox out of their class,
give her a chance to show her
Stock and we will ask nothing
turtlier. By their refusal Lcnox
claims the’ state championship.
and it is here untildefeated by an
Iowa college.
