parative merits of the art gallery
and the business college as factors
in national development.” The
subject was somewhat out of the
line of the usual political and eco-
nomic questions, and the earnest
ness shown bythe prepared speaks
ers and the volunteers seemed to
justify such a departure. In the
absence of the president. the de
bate was summed up by the vice-
president. who gave his decision

for the art gallery.

Grinnell Institute

The meeting of the Institute
last Saturday evening was remark-
able neither for the number pres
ent nor for the quality of work
presented. Owing to the absence
of several members who were on
the program, the literary program
was mainly extemporaneous.
there being only two prepared
numbers.

Snyder gave the current events
oi the week in a very interesting
manner. and Swan followed with
a reading which was well selected
and well given.

The remainder of the program
was extemporaneous work, which
did great credit to the chambers
who participated.

Parish rendered an extemporar
neous solo and received an ens

thusiastic encorc. and Davis spoke
on “Territorial Expansion.” oils
on the “Race Troubles in North
Carolina," and Natl-is on ”The
Foolbzlll Championship oi lown "

Following this came the debut:
on the subject, “Resolved: that
the United States should adopt
the Swiss referendum," This was
decidedly the best part of the
evening program and aroused
much interest in the membels

present. as was shown by the
number who volunteered. En-
gelke and Delavan upheld the n(»
ﬁrmativc. while Eldridge and

close and spirited on both sides.
