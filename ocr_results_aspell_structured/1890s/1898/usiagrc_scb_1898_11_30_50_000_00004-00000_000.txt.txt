when both those teams are strong.
the formal haviug’beaten North-
western and University of Illinois
and the latter having beaten Kan-
sas and Missouri. Glinnell met
wtth but one defeat and that the
last game she played. More than
this the defeat was at the hands
of a team that never scored on
her before this year, though they
have played many games with her
and only last year the score was
30 to o in favor ot Grinnell.

S. U. I. too for the ﬁrst time
went down before Drake and also
before the State Normal, a team
that never had any reputation in
the game. These remarkable (lee
feats were in the fore part at the
season and cost the team the sup-
port ot the student body of the
University. This was won back
by the quality of tootball the team
played against Grinnell which tar
exceeded any playing they had
done during the season and suc-
ceeded in tying Grinnell's score.
This with their Thanksgivrng

Nebraska. in great measure ree

of the season.

in the game.

The State Nolmal for the ﬁrst

these teams. ’The unusual spirit
and dash shown by the Penn team
nearly took their visitors off their
feet.

The state championship never
was more in doubt. While there
are only two teams that claim it,
none relinquish their right to an
equal place or admit the claims of
either team. Drake claims it but
their claim is manifestly unfound-
etl when they have been defeated
twice this season by Iowa teams
Antes also claims it because she
has lost no game in Iowa and has
beaten Drake. She beat Drake,
however, by a score of only 16 to

l5 and did not play any other
strong Iowa team and was defeats
ed by Nebraska who. in turn,
went down before Drake.
