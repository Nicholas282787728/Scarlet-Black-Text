Chrestomathian,

If the spirit of loyalty and the
quality of work manifested at the
opening so, on of the Chi stOr
iiiatliian Literary Society indicate
anythingfot' the future, its pros
pects for steady. lllgltrgrade liter-
ary Work during the coming year-
are indeed bright. '

chair Mr. Lconarcl gave several
strong reasons for his beirci In
the success of society work 'in
Iowa College during the present
school year and appealed to the
nienibers’to maintain tiie high
standards which have prevailed in
the Cllrcstomttlltian Society for
nearly half a centuiy.

The ﬁrst number on the pres
gram was a vocal solo by Miss
honsqnet, who kindly responded
to an encore.

The (leclamation by Calderr
wood indicated more than ordi-
nary ability in this line, and was
act-edittothesociety. McCarty's
comic lecture ivas an entire sues
cess. In the role of Artcmtts
Waid he proceeded to rclatc his
ideas and adventures to thc great
aniuscmcnt of all present. The
speech by Douglass deserves
special commendation both for
thc pleasing manner ct delivery
and for the high sentiment ex-
pressed. His talk was along the
line of reflections on the late wai
with Spain. Attcr spealring or
the wellrknown treatment accord-
ed American soldiers during the
war, and the mean commercial
spirit which seeks to proﬁt by the
nation's dcfenders. he asserted
that the highest term of coinage
is that which will enable a man to
checrruily accept obscurity, calr
umny or persecution in the dis
chargcotsocialdntres. Mr.0wcn
read a selection from “Beside the
Bonnie Brier Bush,” in which he
showed a complete mastery of
the Scottish dialect.

Miss Anger favored the society
with a piano solo which was fully
appreciated by all.

The debate concerned a ques-
tion ot special importance at the
present time,7namcly, territorial
expansion by the United States.
The policy ot expansion was de-
fcnded by Grier and Mollcr. and
opposed by A. Risscr and Crabb

A highly iniercsting pro»

beyond all doubt that successful
society work can be carried on
during the football season. Nears
ly all the old members were pres
cat and many visitors. After the
new ofﬁcers were installed, the
president gave his inaugural ad-
dress. He reviewed the history
of the society and commented on
its picscnt condition and bright
prospects. He also made an carne
est appeal for more conscientious
work in the present term. Frisbic
followed witlt a review of the last
three months. It was comprehene
sive, yet omitted no detail of in
terest or importance. A paper
by Snidei, on the new colonial
policy. showed careful study and
thorough preparation. He took
the position thattlie United States
has enough dimcult qttcstions at
home, without seeking for them
in other coliiitiics. Miss Millerd
favored the society with an instru-
mental selection. Miss Bousquet
followed with a vocal solo. They
wete both compelled to respond
to an encore. In the extempora-
neous work, Crandall spoke on the
death of l’rcsitlent Scliacffer. and

Peace in the W. I. A. A.

Just before the Field-meet of the
W. I. A. A., tvhicli was held last
spring, the Universities of Micht»
gan, Illinois, and Chicago, enter-
ed an emphatic protest against
the eligibility of Maybury and
Cochetns, the two famous athletes
of the University of Wisconsin, to
compete in games held under the
auspices ot the association. The
tivo men accused, emphatically
denied all charges of professional»
ism, and were upheld by their urti-
versity, and as a result the three
complaining institutions pulled
out of their alliance and held a
ﬁeld-meet on their own account.

tame victory over the smaller in-
stitutions left in the association.

Immediately arter the meet. the
W. I. A. A. held a meeting and
expelled the three bolters from
their company, Uiidaunted, the
recreant three organized a league
at their own, and ﬁnished up the
spring athleticsithat is, the
baseball, among themselves.
on the whole, the new arranges
nicnt worlted against Wisconsin,
as it compelled her to engage in
athletic contests with teams which
were in no way her equals.

dicament as in the springicut off
from all chance of battling for the

toes, and restricted within limits
too circumscribed to suit the
haughty Wisconsin sp t. Ac-
cordingly, they began to make
overtures of peace, with the result
that an amicable adjustment is
now assured. Letters of expla-
nation havc been sent to Illinois,

athletic council of the University
of Wisconsin seems to be disposed
to make all reasonable conces»
