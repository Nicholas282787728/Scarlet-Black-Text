sel'rcd to Show too pluinly the
gloomy status of our
Lindsay, Foster and Tliiel were
all forced to quit the contest and
it Is a moral certainty that hard,
as the remit of ,1 wl'elicllcll ankle,
will talre no opposition hciorc the
Minnesnta q'nuru, Douglass, al~
ready on: of practice for mom
than awcck, must abstain from
opposition until our contest with
the Gophers next Saturday. The
injuries in themselves are very
discouraging. but when, following
such an cxecx'ablc exhibition as
Grillncll made at Des Moines [“l'l'
any, its candidates mantles: an
attitude of complacence, one is
constrained to ask, “Shades of
Van Gieson, l’ooley and Savage,
where me we at?"

About ﬁt’tccn inen appeared for
pl'actlcc Saturday afternoon, most
or uhnnr u‘cte scrubs. Caprnu,
who nus in anything but good
form in the Drake game, failed to
appear Saturday or Monday—a
total of three days without prac-
tice and the Minnesota game less
than a week distant, Fisk, who
was guilty otdisgraccnil fumbling
in practice last week, was also an
absentee. Does anybody Slips
pose the pl‘oteges or Dr, Knipc
or Mr. Pottci- are showing such
indifference?

At such a time as this SCARLET
AND BLACK wishes to appeal to
varsity mid scrub alike tor a long
pull and u strong pull altogether.
This is a critical hour. Giinnell
needs the aid of every man that

eleven.

 

can ﬁnd a football suit. No mate
ter what the result at Minnesota,
lct MIL/“y man be out way night
pram/7141i at 435.

The Drake game fountl Grur
ncll very weak at
game. Prints were handled in
miserable form while the linemen
failed completely to rise to the
occasion until the last half. In
passing, mention should be made
of Drake’s excellent work. Uli-
der Mr. Potter's coaching it has
already made great strides in foot
ball, its mass work was superb.

Gllnncll won not by playing bet- ,.

tel football, but simply on pllysl'r
cal condition. It can now thank
Mr Potter for insisting with such
veliemence on 25 minute halves.
He thus unwittingly defeated his
own team However a different
situation may be looked tor
Thanksgiving clay tor Drake
plainly showed it has the true
football spirit. The game passed
off With little wrangling. the
Athletic Union cleared about $175
and with good weather the
Thanksgiving contest should be
more successlul iii every way than
that of Friday.

Friday morning the Gi'innell
football team will leave for Min-
neapolis to do battle with the
warriors from the University of
Minnesota.

Since last yem, the Gap heis
have changed their style otp pin)
and have adopted the formidable
gualds back” formation which
has niatle Pennsylvania famous.
This fall they are under the trainr
ing oi “Jack" Minds, Pennsylr
vania's captain and tun—back of
last year and are reported to have
made rapid strides in their new
system That they are playing
good football fol this time of the
season, is evident from their vise
tory over Rush last Saturday.

Under these circumstances it
may be readily seen that our team
will have no easy work cut out for
it on suturday.
