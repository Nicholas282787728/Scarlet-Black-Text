Many a gitt to Iowa college
comes to us laden with such sar
cred associations. These are live
ing monuments. still giving lite of
mind and heart to the college men
and women of the generations
that iollow. one yearagoasimir
lar gift came to the library trorn

WE ARE pleased to state that
the date for the Cornell-Grinnell
debate has been satisfactorily ar-
ranged and that the annual event
will occur this year on Friday,
March t7. Through some mis~
take our debaters had thought
that this was the day which had
been set, but it seems that. March
3 had been previously agreed up
on. However, during the past
few days the committees of the
two colleges have ﬁnally agreed
upon the later date.

THE FOLLOWING letter from one
of the best friends of the College.
readily explains itself:

"Ta [/22 T mum of Iowa College:

GENTLEMENZ—On this the sec-
ond anniversary of the passing on
of my beloved son, Elbridge
Dwight Rand. I desire to give to
Iowa College for its library the
sum of one thousand dollars, to be
used as follows: three hundred
dollars to be expended on books
for the Department of Applied
Christianity, one hundred and
twenty-Five [or the Greek Depart-
ment, one hundred and twenty-
ﬁve for Modern Languages. one
hundred andtlilenty~ﬁvc for Phil-
osophy and Art. one hundred ior
History. seventy-ﬁve tor English
Literature. one hundred for Music,
and ﬁfty for Latin. The cost of
the ﬁnishlng of the wood work in
the library building will be about
three hundred dolla ' in addition
to the above, making a total of
thirteen hundred dollars.

And may the blessing oi our
Heavenly Father be upon this
college and all who are connected
with it.

Your faithful frlend,
CARRIE A. RAND.
February 8th, i899.“

THE DAY of Prayer for Colleges
originated several years ago. and
at the present day itis almost uni—
versally recognized among the
colleges of Amcrica and Great
Britain, so that termorrow as the
students here are assembled in the
various meetings of the day, all
over this land and even across the
waters there will be held similar
gatherings of young men and
women, met in prayer for the stu-
dents of all institutions of learning
and for the inﬂuence which may
go out from these institutions. It
is one of the most helpful days of
the entire year and should be tak»
en seriously by every student. It
is a day for thought and reﬂection,
and for decision and determina-
tion. It may mean much to every
student; it may mean nothing.
For him who puts himself in the
right attitude it will come fraught
with blessing; for hint who enters
upon it with careless inditiercnce,
it will mean nothing. No student
is required to attend any one oi
the services, but no one can afford
to let his place be unoccupied.

Day of Prayer.

The Day of Prayer for colleges,
which formerly came on a week
day late in January, was changed
during the past year so that it
now comes on Sunday. This year

the day set apart is tomorrow Feb.
i2. As has been the custom here
[or several years, there will be
special services for the students,
