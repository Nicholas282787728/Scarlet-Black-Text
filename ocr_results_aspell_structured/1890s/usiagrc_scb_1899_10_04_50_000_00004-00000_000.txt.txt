The Drake Games

Drake's games with S U. I. and
Grrnnell are off. Immediately afr
ter the ﬁrst meeting of the games
committee ulllch declnled Homer
Holland a professlunill, Drakc.
through enmity toward lllosl: in-
stitutions which she considered re-
sponsible for this decision, de-
clared her games with s. U. I. and
Grinncll cancelled.

Theselatterschools.recognizing
this step taken by Drake as one
caused by more personal enmity,
agreedthat.asHonierHollandhad
justly been declared a profession-
al and as Drake's stand was taken
in a spirit which indicated no good
to pure athletics in Iowa, they
should stand ﬁrm in insisting that
Drake should play all three games
scheduled with them. This Drake
rerused to do, and accordingly 5
U. l, and Grinnell Will not meet
heron the gridiron this fall. What
this means to Grinnell is hardly‘
understood hytheordinary observ»
er. It means the loss to her of
her two most proﬁtable games in
a ﬁnancial way. as heretofore she
has ﬁgured to make her accounts
balance by the receipts of these
two games.

We have averaged ontheThanks-
giving games all the way from
three to ﬁve hundred dollars, and
the loss of this sum will be hard
to make up. The management,
however, is making every effort to
ﬁll the vacant dates. and hopes to
secure good games.

Cornell will have an Alcove or
Sociology in its library. The Ale
cove is endowed for live hundred
dollars.
