SCARLET AND BLACK extends a
hearty welcome to all students,
new and old, with the hope that
this year may be a happy and
proﬁtable one to all. We con»
gratulatc the new students on their
selection of a college and feel sure
that a tew weeks’ stay at Grinnell
will show them the wisdom of
their selection, » We hope that
they may ﬁnd College lite as pleaSr
ant as it has been to those who
have been at Grinnell before and
that they may have as great en~
thusiasm for the intelests of the
college as has characterized the
studentsotpastyears, Grinnell’s
strength lies in the fact that the
student body is not divided into
factions, as is often the case in
college lite, but whatever is un-
dertaken receives the support of
nearly every student. One word
of advice SCARLET AND BLACK
would give to the new studcnt.
Do not limit your cnergies to any
one line of college wotk whether
it be study, athletics or something
else. The value of college life is
not tovbe measured by the benc-
ﬁts secured from any one of these.
All should receive a fair amount
of your attention. Let this year
be a prosperous one tor the col-
lege as well as for the individual
student even it it may mean some
little sacriﬁce on the part of each
one

As T0 the prospects ot Grin-

place for him on the ﬁeld. There
is room for cvery man in college.

college unless it shall be ordered
discontinued. It is the only colr

ﬁdent that no one connected with
the college can afford to do with
out it, It is published twice a
week—on \chnesdays and Sat-
urdays. and the college news,
notices and other matters of im-
portance which it contains makes
it indispensable to all. It is our
aim to make the paper as trcsh
and interesting as possible so that
every student will be glad to be-
