Review of Football Season

Grinllell has concluded its ttinth
lootballseason. Out record, on
the face oi it. is not very ﬂattere
iiig. A comparison with other
teams in our class. however, by no
means r'ntlicates that it has been

average one whit above our own.
or these all have played at least
tour hard games and all. save
Grinnell, have been defeated at
least twice. Of its four import-
arit gain ., Grrnnell won two, tied
for one and lost one. We cannot
be satisﬁed with tile results, but,
on the other hand. we have as his
tle cause [or complaint as any
other team in our class.

Few seasons have opened with
prospects- more encouraging titan
thatjtrst closed. We had, meas
ured by Grinnell standards, an
abundance of material. There
was little "beet” on hand but the
array ot good. average, speedy
men was more conspicuous titan
tliat of last year. Our line was
almost intact and with but two
vacancies in the back ﬁeld there
was every reason to believe Grin-
neli would make a splendid show
ing. The Penn and S.U. Lgames
were genuine disappointments
while our Thanksgiving match
with Drake resulted, as expected,
in defeat. This on the lace of it,
is not a very formidable record.
But he is deluded who thinks any
apology necessary for the '98
eleven, Results are not neces-
sarily measured by scores and all
things considered there is much
in the record oi the team of which
any Grilltiell man may reel more
than proud.

It has bcen our boast in the
past that no teams ever met de-
ieat and retired wrtlrgreatcr credit
than those representing Gi-rnnell,
Neverhasthis been more true of
a Grinncll team than this fall.
We are not accustomed to squeal
when beaten or to offer airy apolr
opies or explanations. There is,

On the whole our deionse was,

In which the work of the eleven

The loyal interest of the stil-

preceding the Drake game. From

statement to say that but for their

A iew words further may be

players to work on their reptttar

On this point it is suﬁ'icient to re-

unable to bring us victory. It is
not presuming to say that it will
require their best efforts to better
