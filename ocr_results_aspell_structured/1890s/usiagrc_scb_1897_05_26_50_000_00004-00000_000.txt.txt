U. l. U., 7; Grinncll, 2.

Upch Iona delcatcd our team
in an exciting game at Fayette
Monday, The boys arrived at
Fayette at noon attet an all night
title. The day was extremely
chilly. and this added to the hand-
ienp at an all night ride, tool: the
ginger out of the team, The Fay-
ette diamond is phenornennlly‘
fast and this had a decided cltcct
on the ﬁelding of our team. Thcrc
was an element of hard luck in it,
tor while Fayette made more er-
rors tltey wct'c comparatively ins
cxpenslvc, WhllC all Fnycttc'
scores were tnttdc :tttct- chances
were given to retire the side. The
Fayette team tlid some fast ﬁeld~
ing and ate strong batters, but
they de‘clate that Davis is the
hardest proposition in the box
they have taced this year.

Dorman is the ﬁrst to hat but
tans. Moilow singles and teaches
second on Ralcy’s ettor. Wzlchtel
tans but Mohr r‘nntis, Howcvcr,
he throws Wachtcl ontat ﬁrst and
Raley returns the ball. getting
Morrow at the plate, Davis toi-
Grinnell goes out, Dottnan to
Caffyn. Rdlcy ﬂies out to Bigler,
and Lindsay after reaching second
is put out while Sargent is left on

ﬁrst.
In the ncxt inning. tor Fayette,

Davis and Edwards get bases on
errors and Davis ﬁnally scores on
a passed bdll before the side is res
tired. 1n the second half Mohr
gets ltis base on balls but is forced
out at second by Shepard. Mores
singles but Cogglc and Tait Ily
ottt to shott stop and center ﬁeld
respectively.

Fayette fails to score in third,
but Davis and Raley score on
shortstop's error and hits by Rae
ley and Lindsay.

Neither score until sixth when

Waelttel draws a triple and scores L

on a ﬂy out to outﬁeld which istc-
turned high to horne.

In the seventh U. I. U, rum in
tlll'ec alter Sargent misses on in~
ﬁcltl fly which would have Ictirctl
the Sith.

 

In the eighth after the ﬁrst two
men go out. errors by Tatt and

Lindsay, iollowed by n tworbag-y

ger. send in the ﬁnal two. The
men go out in order in the ninth.
In the ciglith Grinnell gels three
men on buses, but inﬁeld lllcs res
tlrc the side, and after tno outs in
the ninth the bases ﬁll only to
gwc Raley a chance to bc beaten
to ﬁrst by a grounder.

NOTES.

Davis' work was magniﬁcent.
Onlytwohitsmadcbcforechanccs
had been given to retire the side,
and Fayette has made a reputzr
tion as heavy hitters.
