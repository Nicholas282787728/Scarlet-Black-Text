other respects. it was unusual. tor
it is believed to be the best gen-
eral recital ever given, Tire piano
numbers were given accurately
and with expression.

Miss Rand played with charac-
teristic case and dignity. Her
graceful rendition of Oelime’s
“What the Flowers Told Me,"
was highly appreciated.

and expressive. Miss Cadwell's
instrumental selections were en-
joyed as were also her vocal num»

were especially line. The clear
tones of her rich contralto voice
iound their best expression in

Address Before the Alumni As~
SOCiation.

Alter the alumni banquet, given
at the Methodist church, the ad-
dress belorc the Alumni associ-
ation was given by Mr. c. c. Cars-
tens, A. B, 'ol. Owing to the
number of attractions during the ,
evening, this lecture was not as
well attended as it rncritcd, but
nevertheless it was well rccerved
and much enjoyed by those pres-
ent,

Mr. Carsicns said in part:

Argument by title is a fallacy,
The study oi history is more truly
a study o[ humanity in its possi-
bilities than aiiy other deﬁnition
we may givetoit, r it The ﬁrst
tangible history is that ol the jews
as given by josophus. Aristotle
looks at history from the Grecian
standpoint. One oi the Latin his-
torians said his part wasto tell the
work of chance in the fall of Ath-
ens. * c The study oi history
lras only too oitcn been vicious ins
stead of ethical. It has been the
story oi burning and massacres
ratherthan the growth of a people.
It has been too much industrial
where it should bi: more social.
We should learn from history the
forces which govern human action.
When great strikes followed the
introduction of the spinning jenny
into England, what was needed
was the power to adjn the cons
ﬂicting forces. ‘F * hvetiiiirc-
ligious institutions, change does
not come without much suffering.
The mental inertia which prevents
men to change with changing cons
di bus is a true stability, but asta-
bility of stagnation and death,

We need a higher comprehen-
sion oi what we call patriotism,~
a patriotism which would call men
to study conditions and after or
riving at a conclusion causes men
to follow their conclusions. ii ’I i'

A trite liistoi'ysliould give to all'
sides their just dues. Sectional
and national animosities should
not affect too strongly the events
recorded.

History is written better now
than iormerly. Literary style is
not only sought, but truth is de-
sired and searched for above all
else. Unlike literature. history is
objective and bases its lessons on
facts. and men learn the true
meaning oi things.
