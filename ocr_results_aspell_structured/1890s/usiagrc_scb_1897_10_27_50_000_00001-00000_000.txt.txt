War'd Field under the most favorable
auspices ttiat tine weather, a good at-
tendaiice, and a large number of con-
testants could assure. A rattrer stiﬁ'
breeze blew directly up the stretch,
making this part of the track soure-
\vhai diﬁicult for the bike men and
sprinters, and tendiirg to make the
lime slower. but in almost every other
respect the day was perfect. The
track itself tras r 'ely been in better
shape and the onrlookers were in no
wise disappointed in the contests.
The liberal handicaps gave the new
men plenty ot chance to win and they
made the most of their' advantages.
lit the list of winners appear many
names that even a year ago were err-
tirel) unheard ot on the track and
field and this fact augurs well for new
material for the track team next
spring. The rnrmber of starters in
the ﬁfty and one-hundred yai'd dashes
was so large that it was necessary to
rrrrr three preliminary treats before the
linals,

up in their places awaiting the crack
of Starter Stipp’s pistol to begin the

cappers had been too liberal and he
was unable to quality. Delavan, ’01,
two yards, won first and Brown, ’Of,
torri' yards, second, 't'imeiﬁve arid

race throughout. Spalrlding worked

and one-half seconds.
