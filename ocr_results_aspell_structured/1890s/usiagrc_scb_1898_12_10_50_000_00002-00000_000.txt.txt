Tue Cncocnoarnrn Society hnd
a very unique and interesting pro
gram yesterday. As for as we
know no Grinnell society has ever-
before attempted to produce a
minstrel show and it is surprising
that the ﬁrst should be given by
one of the women societies. The
whole program was decided
success. The members played
their parts well though in a role
entirely new to each. Tire eosv
tumcs were well gotten tip and
were a decided aid to the pore
torniance. The originality and
tact displayed cannot be too high
ly praised.

a

Observant men who have tllc
interests of Grinnell College ath-
leticsalways at heart have watched
with p'aiii and anxiety llle growth
of a spirit of laxness and careless
ness in the performance ol the ob
ligatioris which athletic lreedom
necessarily entails, They rejoice
to see that there lives in Grinnell
men, the old do-or-dre spirit by
which they llavewon glorious vice
tories and met not ingloiious der
teats; but they deplore certain
tendencies which if unchecked
will lead to the degradation of the
ethics of Grinnell athletics.

These tendencies take many
forms. and it is one of these forms
that the ofﬁcers of the Athletic
Union propose to Check. .

Every man who enters Grinnell
athletics knows before he has
worked three days that he is re-
ceiving privileges for which he IS
expected to pay. The football
man wears Athletic Union suits
and plays on Ward ﬁeld undel a
competent coach provided by the
Athletic Union. The track-man
uses the traclt and leccivus the
beneﬁt of the instruction of a
trainer procured by the Athletic
Union.

Now the constitution of the Athr
letic Union plainly states that any
man who does not pay his Athletic
Union dues will be tlcprived of all
privileges or the Union.

If this means anything it r'neans
this: The man who does not pay

The ofﬁcers of the Athletic Unr
ion, in order to prevent the com»
plete subversion of Itite constilur
tion and of the spirit of the con-
stitution, have decided that the
time has come when they must
takeastand fortvholesome athletic
government and they appeal for
support to every man in crrnnell
College who has at heart the in-
telests of Grinnell athletics.

Henceforth the oFﬁcers of the
Athletic Union intend as far as lies
in their power to entorce the con-
stltution of the Athletic Union.
No man shall have the athletic
priVIleges ot the Union until he
pays for them.

On Monday, December I9, will
occur one of the most important
Athletic Union meetings of the
year. At that time the election
of the managers for the football
and track teams will take place
and other important business will
be considered. The ofﬁcers of
the Union wish to announce that
at this meeting NOT a MAN \erI.

paid his ATHLETIC UNION DUES.
