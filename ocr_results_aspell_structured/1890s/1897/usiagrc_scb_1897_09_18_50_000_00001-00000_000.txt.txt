The Opening Chapel,

Following the custom inaugur-
ated by Dr. A. L. Frisbie last
year, Rev. Loren F. Berry delivV
ered an address to the students at
the opening chapel on Wedncs
day morning. Mr. Berry is a
busy pastor ot a large Congrega-
tional Church in Ottuniwa and
has been since 1394 a member of
the board of trustees of Iowa Cole
lege.

Taking as his subject “Intellecb
ual Thrift" he outlined brieﬂy bltt
concisely its iundanrental iactors.
enforcing each point by an apt
quotation or characteristic aneCr
date. In outline he said as fol
lows:

it mind is greater than matterr
it the intellectual life is of more
importance than the physical,then
upon those to whom “much has
been given" in the way of advan»
tages for intellectual training and
discipline rests the responsibility
of gaining therefrom the largest
possible results with the least pos»
siblc waste of energy and time.
In striving to develop the whole
mind. the prime iactors are keen
observation. the recognition of
the fact that all truth is “bi-polar"
or that it is entirely relative to
one's point of view. a mental dis
cipline so strict that a man can at
any desired time rcprodrrce what
he has learned, attention to detail,
a deﬁnite plan. the completion or

effort, and the proper division of
time between intense labor and
absolute l‘est. Equipped wiTh all
these a man will be “intellecttb
ally thriity” and Will be prepared
to accomplish the “much that
shall be required oi him.”

Thc address throughout was
stirring and helpful and formed
an appropriate beginning for a

 

year from which we all hope
great things.

Y M. C. A. Lecture Course.
1897-98.

For litany years the entertains
merits git-en in the Lecture Course
of the Y. M. C. A. have been the
chief attractions of the college
year. They have always been oi
a high grade and have merited
the hearing of iill who are in the
least interested in education.

On account of the concert series
arranged by l’roiessor cole. the
course this year will be exclusive
ly conﬁned to lectures, of which
there will be four. The ﬁrst will
be given by Rev. J. J Lewis of
Chicago, who will deliver his
great lcctirre on "Tile Passion
Play of Oberamrnergau," on No-
vember [9. It riill be illustrated
by ster-copticon views of photo-
graphs taken by Mr. Lcwis him»
self. Some idea of the popularity
of this lecture may be gained from
the fact that it has been delivered
Fillet-n hundred times, and last
year was given over ﬁity times in
Boston alone. The Passion Play
itscli is oi decp religious interest
and is made doubly so by the im-
pressive presentation of Mr, Lewis.
On account of urgent demands
coming tram all parts oftlre coun
try, he has been compelled to res
sign his pastorate and devote his
entire time to the platform. Most
of his dates, however, will be ﬁlled
in the east.

Booker T. Vi’aslrington who it ill
lectureJanuar-y at on “The Negro
Problem as it is being solved at
Tuskegee" won (or lumseli a na.
tional reputation by his addre-
at the opening oi the Atlanta
position and is today recognized
as an eminent author and educar
tor. As principal oi the Tusker
gee Normal and Industrial Instlr
tute he is doing a magniﬁcent
work in uplifting and educatrng
his race“ and has well been called
"The Moses of his people." Many
of us have heard him and by these
as well as by those who have not
yet hear-d him. he will be gladly
welcomed to our college and town.

On Saturday evening. February
lg. Rev. Thomas Dixon, Jl‘,, will
give his most characteristic lectr
ure. “Backbone." Mr. Dixon

auditorium is now crowded every
Sunday by even greater millti»
tildes than once assembled to hear
iii. Talrnage. in the fall oi i859
amid most hostiie criticism. he
began a series of sermons attach-
ing Tammany Hall and munici—
pal Corruption. Three years later
when Dr. Parkhurst‘ made his at-
tach- upon Tammany, Mr. Dixon
was the ﬁrst minister to come to
his defense. During the struggle
he was arrested and indicted, but
after his release he continued his
endeavors to purify municipal
government in New York City,
His manner is free, simple and
strikingly original. From the
ﬁrst he captivates his audience
and holds their closest attention
to the errtl.

The last lecture ot the course
will be given by the Hon. Charles
E. Fitch of Rochester, New York,
on March 1. In the west Mr.
Fitch is probably the least known
of the four lecturers, but in the
east he is well known both as a
journalist and lecturer, His leet»
tire courses may be classed under
two subjects: “civil and Religious
Liberty ill America" and "Euro-
pean Statcsrncn in the XIX. Cent-
ury,” one or both of which have
been given beiore many eastern
collegesanduniversities. For his
western trip he has a new lecture.
“The Hopeful View.” which will
be given here.

It has been iound necessary to
discontinue the plan oi voluntary
contr-ibutionsto nieetthcexpcnscs
of the lecture course. When this
plan was introduced four years
ago it had every indication of bee
ing a success; but for the past two
years the course has barely paid
for itselt and has to be dropped
{or the present. The price of the
tickets. however. has been made
low enough to be in reach of all.
The course tickets will be sold for
Si 00 each until October is and
should be purchased at once.
After October 15, the price will
be raised to Sl.25. Reserved seats
will cost lo cents extra for each
entertainment. Tickets for a sur-
glclccture,socentseaclr. Course
