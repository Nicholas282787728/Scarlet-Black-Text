ing of the Y. M. C. A. in Institute

stead or the usual prayer meeting.

_Chrestomathian

The ﬁrst meeting of the term
opened rrp very auspiciollsly.

The program was opened by
the inaugural address of Mr. Piner.
It' was a thoughtful production,
presenting a very high ideal of so-
ciety work. He advocated the
cultivation of the same “Grinnell

. spirit" in connection with society
work, which is so conspicuous in
our athletics. “Many persons
merely exist while a few live,” he
said. What we want in our socie
ety work is not to merely exist as
an organization; but to beaggrese
sive.

Mr. Calderlvood gave a paper
on the topic, “Has Oratory Dee
clined?” which he tool: the
ground thatjt had not, but that
the occasion for it was not pres
ent. He claimed that the orator
was made by circumstances.

The next number on the plo-
gram was a recitation, by Mrr
Quaife, which consisted of an ar
rangemcnt of “Ben Hur's Chariot
Racc.” The gentleman wasimbtled
with the spirit of his production,
and so, considering the nature or
the selection, could not fail to stir
the emotions or his auditors.

Mr. Mar-sir gave a rather exteri-
sive summary of the news of the
week.

in

More time than usual was given
to extemporaneous work, Mr,
Peck discussed “The Advantages
of the Glee Club to the College,”
Mr. Marsh, “The War Between
Turkey and Greece;” Mrr Crabbe,
“The Harlan Campaign,” Mr.
Johnson, “The Advantages of In—
tercollegiate Debates." The
speech ot MixMarsh on tthurko-
Grecian war was espl‘cirtlly inter-
esting because ot

familiarity with the
of that conﬂict, and hi
tress of conviction in i
affair.

Mr. Brande favo‘ed the society

The debate was on the question:
“Resolved that Canada Should be
Anncxetl to the United States.”
The aihrrnative was supported by
Smith and Gray; the negative by
Grates and Johnson. The nega
tive obtained the decision.

A Foe to American Schools.

The Minneapolis correspondent
of the Chicago Til/tlS-I’IN‘ﬂ/tl' nlene
tions President Gates’ new book
as iollowsin a dispatch to that
paper:

“President George A, Gates oi
Iowa College has just issued irom
the press of a Minneapolis pub-
lishing house a book entitled “A
Foe to American Schools,” in
which he savagely assails what he
terms the great book titlst or time
nopoly.

After sketching the history of
the formation of the company
and the means by which it came
into the control of from 75.to 80
per cents of the school book busi-
ness of the country, President
Gates says the statements of
agents that there are 150 compet-
ing ﬁrms is hardly a compliment
to the intelligence of the healers,
and that, with the exception of
two or three companies who do a
triﬂing business compared with
the American Book Company.
that concern is already without
competition.

Though but six years old, the
company has achieved all this, he
aserts, by “trust methods," a term
which he deﬁnes as “bribery, ca-
jolery, threats, promises, political
intrigue, securing the election ot
teachers and boards favorable to
themselves, suborning local‘news-
papers. silencing opposition.”

He cites twelve cases oi alleged
bribery, for which he has support-
ing afﬁdavits or statements which
may be substantimcd by credit»
able witnesses. Case No. I
from lllinois.

is

President Gates says he has re-
cently had in his hand a bank
draft for a considerable sum of
money which was given to a prom-
inent lawyer who was the partner
of a member of the school board
in their city. This check is sign.
ed by the manager ot the Ameri-
can Book Company in one of the
largest cities in the union. On

the back of the check is this ins
dorsemellt:

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 28, l897.

“This check was offered to me
in the nature ot abl'ibe, and 1 re
{use to have it cashed.”

The other cases cited are
New York, Iowa, Montana, Miche
igan, Washington and Missouri,
Tire alleged bribes are declared
to run from $400 to 55,000.”

This is the paper read by Presie
dent Gates betore the College

in

Section of the Southeastern Iowa

Teachers Association last month.
The college section voted to err
dorsc the paper and suggested its
publication. It is published by
the Kingdom Company and is
now on sale.
