The program was opened with
a vocal solo by Mrs. Grinncll-
Jones and n duet by the Misses
Wetilrore.

The program took the form of
a Hill Prize Contest, each speak-
er being allowed seven minutes.

Miss McClzlllnllnn spoke of the
Famine in India, bringing the sit-
uation elenrly beroretlre audience.
She claimed that the only remedy
is to Cill'i
breaking down the caste system

Theories or Collcgc Dis iplrne

sultory rnanner. So tar the speale
er-s evinced a difﬁculty in the
choice of words and gave too lit-
tle attention to the main object of
a Hill Prize Contest, "to convince
the audience," Those following
spoke more ﬂuency and
greater pelsuasivelless.

Thc Need of Civic Training of
Children was strongly argued by

marlrs were especially evcellent.

Miss Kellenbarger discusscd
Liberty in Speech as brought to
ptiblic attention by the action of
the trustees oi Brown Unlt‘elslly
with reference to Dr, Andrews.
The matter was presented in a
logical way with a pleasing delivr
cry.

While the society waited for
the decision or the judges Mrs.
Jones paid a beautiful tribute to
Mr. Chamberlain. speaking with
warm appreciation ol hispetsonztl
friendship {or the students in the

Football.

The football practice this week
has shown both encouraging and
discouraging features. A Strong“
ci— scl'tlb has lined up than at any
previous time this year, Willie the

varsity has been somewhat liarrrli-

capped by the absence of Doug-
lass and Copgcslrall rronr the
ends. But this fact is not cllough
to account for the way in which
the scrub has bcen making yards
and yards through the varsity
The guards and tackles
must rcincniberto size up a play
accurately and quickly, to charge
liarti using the still am, and
above all things else when the play
is coming through the line to play
LOW.

One week troni torclay we meet
5, U. I. at Iowa City. They de-
pend largely upon their ~Perrn.
syltailiatandem” for their gains.
Itis only by remembering and
practicing every bit or football
knowledge that each man has and
by playing throughout with‘the
despciation that marked the last
ten minutes of the Ames game
that we can maketlie i-csult one
which will be an honor to our-
selves and to our institution.
