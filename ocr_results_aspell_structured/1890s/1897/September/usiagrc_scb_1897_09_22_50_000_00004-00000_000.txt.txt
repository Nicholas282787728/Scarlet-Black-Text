ly lor the backﬁeld and tackle
positions. Norris, l’lercc, Baggsi
Lindsay, lrlaines, Hulsizcr, Rule,
Bird, Pelry and Foster are all My
lug hard tor positions, and the
chances are that Gi'innell will have
abrilllant galaxy of backs when
the season opens. Captain Coggc-
shall, Crary, Douglass, Petty.
Brown, Smith and others, are
working like Trojans on the wings
of the line, Tait, Sllcpnid, Biod-

competition keen in the tackle
positions, while Capron, Gardner.

the nCW as well as old men in rc-

no time to rest on our laurels ol
the last three yeals but every man
should remember that a new
trophy ciip will be presented by
the 1.1. CA. A. next spring to
theteam winning state meet at

In order to have this cup grace

thinks he can do anything in the
the line of track athletics or not,

struct new men in any events
which they may choose and all
new man are urged to come but.
