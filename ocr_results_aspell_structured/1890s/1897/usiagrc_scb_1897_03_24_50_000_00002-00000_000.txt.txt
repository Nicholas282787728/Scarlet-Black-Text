QED ituriul

THE meeting ol the students
which was adjourned from last

Wednesday evening to meet againi

this evening has a matter before
it of vital interest to zlll. It is a
matter which should not be acted
upon with haste but due cons
sideration should be given to both
sides ot the question. It has not
been the policy of the SCARLET
AND BLACK to advocate either side
but our columns have been open
to any
their views therein. The import
ancc of attending the meeting
this evening should be seen by
every student. This is a matter-
et‘fectntg the whole college and
every student should show his in
terest by his presence.

... i

This coriniUNchTioNof Dr, Netw
man in another column should be
carefully noted by allconcerned.
The advice of the skilled plac—
titioner is of great value to the
athlete, and to his caleful superr
vision in the past is in a large
measure due the fact that there is
hardly a case of permanent injury
in the history of Gi‘inncll athletics,
and the testimony of beneﬁt de-
void irom participation in the
sports is almost unanimorrs. The
records which Dr. Newman has
kept of some of the men whose
athletic prowess is part ot collepc
taaditions, are highly instructive,
and it these are placed within
reach of all, they cannot fail to
prove the value ot systematic exr
ercise, and to encourage particle
pation in athletics ot all who ’tvish
to provide for a sound mind and
sound body. These records will
be a considerable factor in solving
the knotty problem concerning

who desired to express‘

Scarlet alto JBlnclt

But not to such students alone has
the need been pressing. The
ability to express himself
a pleasing manner rs something
that Cvety student should cultir
vatc, but tor scvctal years past
no opportunity has been offered
to obtain the necessary instrucs
tion. The loss is 2t serious one
and one which will be noticed
perhaps by the student
alter his separation trom college.
It is surprising that this dCPiHL
rnent ot the college has been al-
lowed to retrograde while others
have been continually building

ulation that some attention is at
least to be paid to it.

looked upon with favor, Fol sevr
