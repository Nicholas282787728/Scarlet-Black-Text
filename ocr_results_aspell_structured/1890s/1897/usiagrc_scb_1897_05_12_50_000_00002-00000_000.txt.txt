THE CELEHRAJ‘ION ot the semis
centennial of the college is but
little overa year away now, and
the time for active preparations
is nearly at hand. It is to be
hoped that plnns will be ready ior
submission to the alumni at their
meeting during commencement
week. as to them will be entrustctl
a prominent part of the exercises
ofsemi»centcnnial. Thepccasion
is one which calls for enthusiastic
support lrorn all students, alumni
and all who have ever been Cons
nectcd with the college. Next
year will be a splendidly ﬁtting
time to meet tlte need for new
buildings, new and larger endow»
ment, better equipment and a
more distinctive name. There
are none of, those to whom this
appeal is addressed but are able
to do something to bring about
these devoutlyiwished consum-
mations, and if unlted efforts are
made, an era ct prosperity and
advance unparalleled in the his
tory at the college will be assured.
Make it Grinnell College and sec-
ond to none!

THE ACTION of tlte Beloit mall~
ager while pcrtectly excusable
ut’tdertlte circumstances has put
our team in somewhat ot a pre»
dieamcnt. BESIdCS being out the
expense of the advertising torthe
game Thursday, it IS rather tins
fortunate to lose tllc gatc receipts
ltvhich would naturally be expects
ed as a result of the presence at
such a drawing card as the Beloit
team would be. It is to be hoped
that the management will succeed
in making arrangements for a
game Saturday in order to keep
up the interest both among sttts
dents and players.
