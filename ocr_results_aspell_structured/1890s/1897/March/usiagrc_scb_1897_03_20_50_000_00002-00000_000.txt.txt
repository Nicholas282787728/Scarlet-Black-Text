the home audience last night is
as gratifying to the College as a
whole as to the mcmbels of the
organizations. The concert last
night assures without a doubt that
unqualiﬁed approval awaits the
on their annual
tour of the state dtlling the
Easter vacation. Their engage
rnents last year were at illcalcule
able service in winning popular
tavor tor the college, and with
the manifest improvement ot this
year, they should score still more
striking success in each place at
which they appear. We extend
our congratulations to Mr. Cole
for his wonderful success, as die
rector, in training ottr two Olgane
izations, and to the membels for
their good fortune in having: such
a leader. as well as for the ﬁdelity
with which they have taken ad
vantage at his leadership. They
will carry with them when they
start out next month, the heart
iest good wishes and conﬁdence
of the entire college.
