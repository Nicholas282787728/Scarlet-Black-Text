Entrance Requirements Raised.
The board at trustees at their
midrwinter meeting, Wednesday,
tormally adopted rneasrrres sub-
» mitted by the laculty, providing
for raising tlle standard of one
trance requirements and for malt»
ing corresponding changes in the
academy curriculum.

The ﬁrst-year Latin class will
have seven recitation hours per
week. instead of ﬁve, as at present.
No advance in the requirements
as to the amount of work will be
made. but the additional time give
en is expected to be of decided
beneﬁt ln the line of thoroughness
in preparation. The academy
Latin as a whole will thus be give
en seventeen year hours, instead
of ﬁfteen. The amount or worlt
required for admission to the col-
lege will remain as at present.

Solid geometry n-rll be made a
freshman study. It will consti~
tute the ﬁrst semeslcl's work of
required mathematics (the three-
hour minor course). arid will be
replaced by trigonometry in the
second semester. College alge-
bra. ltilherto required of all stu—
dents, will be required only of
those who elect tlle scientiﬁc
groups, in which ten or more so-
mester hours of mathematics is
the requirement. Thiscoursewlll
be the twoshour minor work
throughout the year,

Two year-s ot preparatory work
in Greek, French 0| German will
be required for admission to the
college, instead or one year's \votk
as heretofore. This will be of
distinct beneﬁt to the language
work or the college, especially the
Greek, French alld Ger-man. It
will place the greater part or the
present mirlor courses in these
languages in the academy and
will permit of corresponding ad
vance in the standard and amount
of work offered ill the college
classes.

The changes in the courses ofr

tered in the academy will be made
at once, going into operation next
year, and the ﬁrst Class. conser

quelltly, which will be prepared ,

to meet the rchscd entrance re-
quirements, will be that entering
as freshmen in l899, at which time
the rules will go into tull cltect.

This is one of the most imporr
tant steps taken indecent years.
and in the matter or requirements
will place the college abreast of
the best colleges east and west
alike.

The S. U. l. Musical Clubs.

An expectant audience greeted
the Glee and Mandolin Clubs of
the State University on their ap-
pearance at the Stone church
Wednesday evening. They were
received lvlth the S. U. I. yell, tolr
lowed by that of Grillncll, and
this cordial welcome prompted
them to their bestr efforts. The
appreciation ot the audience is
shown by the repeated eucores.
The ﬁrst number by both clubs,
and the university song, “Fair
Iowa," by the glee club, were the
best received of the
"Cavatlna," by Mr. Graham and
Mr. Kelley, was probably the best
indrvidrral number. and every one
in the audience regrets that they
