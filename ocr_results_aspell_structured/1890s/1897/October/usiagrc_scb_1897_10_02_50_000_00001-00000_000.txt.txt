Calocagathia,

The nreeting of Calocagathia
was called to orderby the presie
dent, Miss Whitman. Roll call
was responded to by quotations
from Tennyson.

The program was opened with
a well rendered solo by Helen
Thomson. She responded to the
hearty encore.

Miss Nellie Clarke followed
with an interesting paper on “The
Haunts and Home” ot Tennyson
giving a brief description of the
home surroundings from which so
many of his poems were written.

The next number was a study
of the “Vision of Fair Women”
by Miss Phelps. Miss Phelps
brought it torth very vividly by
reciting parts ot the verses of
these beautiful women who ap.
pear to the poet wlro has fallen
asleep in a dense wood.

Miss Parsons recited “The Dy-
ing of the Old Year” which was
thoroughly enjoyed by all.

The extemporarrcous work was
a very pleasing and interesting
feature of the afternoon. Miss
Gallaher gave a very entertaining
talk on “Where I and
what I saw" this summer, giv»
ing an account of her trip in the
east and some very entertaining

went

 

anecdotes in connection with the
Frcsidcntial Party which was at
Point Bluffs at the same time she
was visiting there. Miss l~lerriott
also told of her trip through the
cast. vrsiting Washington, New
York and many places of interest.

Miss Noel gave astheiast nums
bcr a very entertaining review or
Dunias' “Three Guardsmen."

Ellis.

The second meeting of the Ele
lis society was opened by an in-
strumental solo by Mrss Edna
Proctor,

Miss Susie Talimrn then gave
a very interesting and instructive
talk on “The Growth and Devel-
opment of London.”

Miss Bcrtha'Turner read the
ﬁrst chapter of an original histor
ical serial story, The scene is
laid in England during the Nora
man conquest, and showed agreat
deal oftalcnt the cons. .
ot plot and incident. The idea at
the serial is to give a more sntise
factory picture of the manners
and customs of thetirne than can
possibly be given in any other
way. It wrll continue throughout
the term.

The extenrporaneous work was
unusually good. Miss May Mc-
Clanahan spoke on “A Book l
Read this Summer;" Miss Kcl»
lenbarger on “An Outing I Had

' this Summer," and Miss Tyer on

“A Tirirrgl Learned thisSummer."
The student Council.

No one of the various institu~
tions which torrn so large a part ot
our college lite is more pcrsistent-
ly misunderstood in regard to its
object and functions than the siti-
dent council The formation of
this court came in response to a
demand ol a large majority of the
students assembled in mass meat
If such a thing was undesiis
able that was the time to express
disapproval, but in view at the
overwhelming vote in favor of its
adoption no other conclusion was
possible than that it was the
choice of the student body. it is
in no sense a police system; its
object is not to punish but to me
drate. It stands as a representa»
tive of school democracy, a ﬁrst
step toward student self-governs
ment as opposed to the old syse

ing.

 

lem ot arbiirary faculty govern-
ment. So far since its organiv -
tion there has been no necessity
for its use, and it is to be hoped
that there shall never be need for
it, but nevertheless it should be
maintained and respected by the
students as a part of their own
life. It is composed of students
elected by the student body from
the various classes and can in no
way except through the fault of
the students themselves become
itrinrical to their best interests.
The members of the council for
the current year are as follows:

’987Irving H. Hart, Sarah M.
Nollen, Florence A. Fonda, \Vill-
iam G, McLaren.

'997William E. Leonard. Elea-
nor Morrison, Roscoe D. Doug-
lass.

’98 Class Breakfast.

Tire seniorclassinaugurated the
social functions ofthe year by a
rather unique picnic this morning.
About ﬁfty members of the class
and a few from the faculty met at
a little after six o'clock at the
Longshore house. where they
tound several hay racks waiting
for them. In these and the sev~
eral private carriages the party
made their way to Jones‘ 'grove,
a few miles northwest of the city
The journey was made without
mishap further than the loss of
the tires and partial collapse of
two wheels on one of the wagons.
The occupants of this load were
distributed among the other vchit
cles and all carried safely to their
destination. A “hot" breakfast
was served, of which beefsteak
prepared ale camp was the main
piece de resistance. After break
fast the members of the class
amused themselves in various
ways, returning to Grinnell ior
dinner. This ﬁrst class gathering
augurs well for the tuture social
success of ’98.
