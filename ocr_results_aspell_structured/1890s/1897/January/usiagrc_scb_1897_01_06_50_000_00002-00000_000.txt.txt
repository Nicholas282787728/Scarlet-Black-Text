The holidays being past it is
time for track athletes to turn
their attention toward the season's
work. It is yet too early to be
gin vigorous training, but, none
too soon to begin the work neces
sary to get the body in condition
to undergo the severe training
later on. To all aspirants for 3111»
letic honors we commend the use
of the gymnasium.

THE CLASS of '97 should not de
lay at all in making preparations
for their share in the program of
commencement week. The sub
stitution of an address by some
prominent man tor the o'rations on
trmehonored subjects by various
members of the senior class was a
decidedly progressive and com-
mendable step, but it was not ins
tended to remove the senior ens
tirelytromthesceneoteommence
ment activity. The public is ale
ways interested in the graduating

class; they judge them as repres ,

sentativcs of what the ﬁnished
work at the college stands tor.
The alumni who return as com»
merrcement visitors are anxrous to
compare the lite, spirrt and work
of the college of today with what
it was in their time. and class day
exercises contribute as much as
any other pi the chk to the fol“
matian of tlleiropmion. The oh
servance oi this day gives oppm'~
tunity not only [or representative
literary productions. hut for the
building up of college traditions
in the way of typical nhser-vances,
The time honored mantle oration
is one of these and the interest
taken in it would seem to warrant
the addition of others. Let the
senior ciass take action at once
that the class day exercises next

lot‘y of the college and may stand

students, and especially those who
are spending their ﬁrst year in
Grtrinell to the Hill and Hyde
prize letcsts ot commencement
wee These contests are looked
upon as criterious ot the folellsic
work of the college. For some
reason they have always aroused
far more interest than the annual
oratorrcal contest which deter
mines our representatives In the
state contest. The illrrsron which
sometimes results from the lack
of attention given this contest
that interest in oratory has tlietl
out in Grilrnell is dispelled from
the mind of any one who attends
the exer-crses of commencement
week. In the handbook will be
found announcements of tlicsc
contests. andwe urge that all those

who rntend to enter them will be-
gin preparation at once. to the
end that the hrgh standard oipnst
