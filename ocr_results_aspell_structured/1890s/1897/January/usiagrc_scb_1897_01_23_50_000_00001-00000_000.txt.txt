Robert Nourse.

The large audience which corn-
pletely ﬁlled the Stone Church
last night attested the popularity
of Dr, Nourse with Grinnell authr
ences. Through some untortu-
nate misunderstandingtlielecturer
was not prepared to give ”The
Bells" which had been announced;
biit substituted [or it, “John and
Jonathan,” From the opening
words in which the typical Eng
lisirman and American were hao
pily portrayed. to the ﬁgure ottlie
great organ with which the lee
ture was closed, it was (ull of in-
structive points and splendid sens
timent. The mutual prejudice of
the two nations was shown and
proven unreasonable and unten-
able, and the obligations of each
to the other were -ecouiited.

The lecturei"s criticisms of de-
tects tn public and political affairs
of America were made in a true
optimistic spirit which showed
faith in the ﬁnal prevalence of all
that is good in the American come
monwealth.

The presentation oi the lecture
was all that could have been der
sired, yet it was.‘_iii itself, some
ivliat disappointing in that it of
iorded practically no opportunity
for dramatic impersonation,
which line Dr. Nourse won such
great tavor- here two years ago in
“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

Those who heard him then hope
that his promise to appear n -t
time in “The Bells', which is stud
to be very dramatic, will he Iulr
