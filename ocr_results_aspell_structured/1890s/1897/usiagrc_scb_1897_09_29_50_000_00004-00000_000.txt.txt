Football.

Grinnell’s football chances'this
year will be just what she makes
them. On the whole, the materi-
al seems to be somewhat better
than it has at this time last year.
The candidates exhibit the right
spirit in their play. and the indica-
tions are that in a short time the
work will be characterized by that
snap and “ginger“ which has gene
erally distinguished it in the past.
The team is light as usual, but if
itdevelopesGrinnell'susualspeed,
taii-ly satistaetory results may be
expected. With a light team
which plays a tast, hard game. a
goodly number oi ﬁrst-class subr
stitntcs is an absolute necessity,
The lack oi them was a great
weakness in the team at last year,
it frequently happens that several
substitutes have to be played in
the most important games. The
men on the SClub should remem—
ber this and be prepared to give a
good account of themselves when
they are called upon, as some of
them doubtless will be. The Mln-
nesota game is only three weeks
oh, and a liberal supply ot substi-
tutes Will be needed for tllat trip,
as [\\'0 games are to be played.
Between now and then some men

cure positions on the teamI while
others, of whom much is expect-
ed, may prove to be disappoint.
ments. To a large extent every
nlan has his destiny in his own
hands. l-lis chances tor making
the team depend upon himself.
Some men who made the team
last year may not be so fortunate
this time.

Besides some othel games, the

ule for the varsity is a very good
one, an unusuallylarge proportion

her coach. Mr. Harris has played
every position in the line except
center, and is perfectly iamiliai
with the work of all the backs.
He learned our system directly
from the man who perfected it.

ﬁnest point of any team Grinnell it

has ever had. He is deep in the
game and has an enthusiasm which
will do for the team all that coachr

creditably out of smaller holes

The E. D. Rand Gymnasium.

The new gymnasium tor women
is, as is probably well known to
both new and old students, the
gift of Miss Carrie Rand in mem-
ory of her father and brother, who
both bore the name E. D. Rand.
The building in exterior follows
closely the plan drawn by Mr. H.
K. Holsman some years ago when
the building of a woman's gym-
nasium was ﬁrst discussed. Some
modiﬁcations were made in the
original plans, both in regard to
interior and exterior, but substan»
tially the building as it stands is a
realization of Mr. Holsmall's plans.
