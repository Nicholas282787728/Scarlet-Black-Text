Am! swoon-r who has attended
the meetings which have been held
during the past few days under the
leadership ct Mr. Sayiord cannot
fail to have been impressed with
the interest manifested, Mr. Say-
tord is a man who can giveareasr
on for the hope that lies within
him. He has no apology to make
(or the Bible and as long as men
arcliving without Christ as their
personal saviorand helpcrhecon-
siders it of more importance to
win men to Christ as such than to
quibble over disputed points of
no vital moment. He emphasized
especially the importance ot a
stronger belief in the fundamental
principles of Christian lite, re-
liance upon Christ through prayer
and a devotional personal study
of the Bible. the revealed word of
God. Mr. Sayford had none of
the emotional methods common
to evangelists, and his inﬂuence
cannot but be abiding. as we felt
that God was speaking by his
spirit through him, urging Chris
tians to live consistent lives. and
those who were not Christians to
accept Christ, who through his
atonement offers lite to every soul.
The tact was brought plainly be-
fore every student that without
Christ he is dead but by a saving
belief he may obtain life. The
thought which above all he would
leave with us is: “Lean upon God
and believe in his word.”

THE iroTroN which was carried
at the last Athletic Union meet-
ing, in regard to granting the
privilege or wearing the "G” to
men who left Grinnell before this
symbol of athletic honor was
adopted. deserves something more
than more notice. The matter
came to light through the unsuu
cessful attempt or one ot our
alumni to purchase one ot the
honor “G” pins. Tht: refusal was
