FOR THE beneﬁt of such oi the
student cyclists as may not be in.
miliar with the bicycle ordinance
now in toree in the city we pub-
lish a part of it in anothercoliimn.
Blocks 3 and 4 and 7 and 8 com-
prise the business portion of the
city from tlle C, R. I. & P. railroad
to 5th avenue, and (tom Broad to
West street. Prof. Buck's words
in chapel Tuesday morning on
this subject were well chosen.
The city countll has been very
lenient in their restrictions on bi—
cyclists and in return the cyclists
owe the people of Grinllell a re
spectful observance of the ordir
nance. We hope when the
quiremenis are fully known to
hear no more complaint in regard
to student riders.

In CONVERSATION not long ago,
a recent graduate who has re»
mained in close touch with the
college life in all its departments,
expressed a doubt as to whether
the arrangements made last year
in regard to an annual joint de—
bate with Cornell were the most
advisable. In view of the fact
that under the conditions hitherto
existing, and which seem to give
no promise of immediate change,
Grlnnell is furodoomed to defeat
whenever and wherever her repre-
sentatives entertliciorensic arena.
Debaters cim not be developed
without debates Constant and
consistent effort is the only key
to successinthisasinctherthings.
The fact that there have been {cw
really good debaters in either or
the societies in the last few years
is due to a variety oi causes which
nray be summed up in lack ot in-
terest on the part of both oFﬁcers
and members. it is ioliy to at-
tribute this lack ot interest, par-
ticularlyin the fall term, to the
undue prominence ot athletics,
foi certainly not more than one-

 

Scz‘irlet :l

fourth of the men of ilic school
are engaged in athletics to >LlCll
an extcllt as to make it impossible
for them to devote much time to
s‘ocicty work. And, on the Con»‘
ti-ary, it l\‘ often found that the}
men who are most prominent inl
athletic, are the mainstays of the
the societies What are the othei
ll‘trCCrfottl'tlls doing? if the socir
ety work is not up to the highest
standard it is for them to make it
so. Until there is more interest
manifested in the society wor

until the debates are more care-
lully prepared and more errthiiei.
astically delivered, until in fact
there triie debating spirit
present in all our societies, thcrc
will remain the possibility ot a
question as to the wisdom of en-
tering the sphere of illtcl‘rcollcgl-;
