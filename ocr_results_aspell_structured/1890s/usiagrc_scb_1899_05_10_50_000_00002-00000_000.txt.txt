THE RESULT of the dual meet.
although somewhat disappointing
ought by no means to be dis-
couraging. It is no disgrace to
lose a meet by so small a score as

' that oi last Saturday. and we enn-

not expect to win alway how-
ever much we may desire it.
This defeat should rather be a
stimulus to fresh efforts. It has
always been the policy of Grins
nell teams to work more earnest-
ly after they have been beaten
than before, and this instance
should prove no exception to the
rule. We have had ample indie
cation of the kind of opposition
we must expect to meet at Des
Moines, and it should add an even
greater earnestness
efforts to win the cup another
year.
