Grinnell Institute.

Last Wednesday evening Grin-
nell Institute closed a hard year's
work with a meeting abounding in
enthusiasm and good intent for
the future.

The main part of the program
was taken up with the preliminary
debate. The question was: "Re-
solved, That the U, S, government
should own and operate the rail»
roads.”

Messrs, Halsey. Lindsay. and
Laybourne upheld the aﬂ'irmative;
and )Nhitley. Campbell. and Swan
the negative. The afﬁrmative em-
phasized the evils of the present
system, gave a method of pur-
chase through the rctirementot
government bonds every twenty-
ﬁve years. and laid stress on the
advantages to accrue from govs
ernment ownership as a system
as againstthe present competitive
regime. The negative claimed
that freight and passenger rates
in America at the present time
are actually lower than in coun-
tries where there is government
operation. and that the opportun-
ity for political corruption under
the advocated system would be
greater than at present. owing to
the formation into one class of so
many government employes.

The pointwasalso madethatthe
present. system is more desirable
owing to the characteristics of the
United States than government
ownership would be,

The society, acting as judges of
debate. decided in favor of the
negative. Professors Macy. Sim~
mons and Johnson. acting as judg»
es of speakers, selected Whitley,
Campbell, and swan, with Halsey
as substitute, to meet the Chresr
tomathians in the fall term.

During the progress of the de-
bate the society listened to two
piano solos by Mr. Cline. which
were heartily received. and to a
vocal solo by Mr. Waterman, who
was forced to respond to an en.

was present and gave a very much
enjoyed talk, and. incidentally,
some good advice.

The society then adjourned to
the Orleans, where reireshments
were served Philadelphia style.

After refreshments toasts were
given galore to the success and
well-bemg of Grinnell Institute
for the ensuing year.

+
Academy Graduatlon.

The Academy graduation Fri-
day afternoon formed an occasion
of unusual interest to all who were
present. All the exercises were
excellent, and reﬂected credit,

.both on the graduates, and on Miss

Smith, who so caretully trained
them.

Prot. Cole opened the program
with an organ prelude. which was
tollowed by a piano solo, excels
lently rendered by Miss Bertha
D. Hill.

Immediately Iollowing came
the inter-society debate, between
representatives of the Philologian
and Lewis Literary Societies, the
speakers for the Philologian being
Austin Haines and Curtis Green.
and forthe Lewis Literary George
Arnold and Edward Dennison.
The question under discussion
“Keogh/ed, That the United
States ought to construct and ope»
rate the Nicauragua Canal." and
the debate proved most interest-
ing. All the speakers had their
subject well in hand and delivered
clean-cut, effective arguments.
The judges, Prof. Macy, Prof.
Norrisand Prof. Main. ﬁnally gave
their decisionili favor ofthespeak»
ers representing the Philologian
Society,

Mr. Harry Millard then delight-
ed the audience with a vocal solo.
following which Miss Katherine
Macy delivered in French "Le
Cure de Cucuga," by Alphonse
Daudet, which was one of the most
interesting reatures of the pros
gram.

A recitation. Mrs. Browning's
“Lady Geraldine's Courtship,"
was exceedingly well rendered by
Miss Gertrude Smith. Following
this, a dialogue from “William
Tell,” was given by Miss Bessie
Ricker and Austin Haines. The
speakers were at ease upon the
stage and showed careful and thor-
ough preparation and training.

class Day Exercises,

Immediately before the cultuin
rose for “As You Like It," the
customary advice and good-will
of the “mantle oration” were give
en by Miss Ethel M. Hunt, with
marked felicity of idea and ex
pression. ,

The version of “As You Like
It," presented by the Seni0l class
lastnightinthe Rand Gymnasium,
was a pleasant and successful vari
ation from the traditional class
day exercises. 'Though there
was considerable departure from
the original text, the dramatic
continuity was unbroken; and the
excellent characterization atoned
for lack of elaborate settings,
which were, under the circurnr
stances, of course impossible.
The costumes, the elocution. the
stage groupings, were all carefully
prepared. Here and there, an
anxious critic might have comr
plained a bit of certain “curtains”
and the logic of "enters" and
"exits. The music by the Brande
orchestra relieved the intervals
between acts, and reinforced the
effectiveness oi several lyric pass.
ages. The audience was sympa.
thetic and the favorable weather
tided the good humor of both
spectators and actors. Liberal
praise is due to Miss Smith for
her ability, and faithfulness in
bringing out the dramatic talents
of the class, and to the class for
so agreeable a performance
achieved in the midst or the hurry
and worry of the closing days of
college life.

It will be impossible to give a
fair or a satisfactory Cliticism of
the presentation. Iowa College
will apparently soon need a spe
Cial dramatic review.
