THE FOLLOWING rule which was
passed by the faculty at the close
of the winter teim has been dis-
cussed to a considerable extent by
the students. The stand SCARLET
AND BLACKlakES, in all probability
does not repr sent the opinion of
the majority of the students, but
it will be glad to puisiish the views
of any who hold the opposite Opin-
ion. The substance of the rule is
as follows: “No student who on
ters college after the beginning of
the academic year shall be per»
niitted to entt—r intercollegiate ath-
letics until the beginning of the
next academic year." The only
that be brought
against this rtile is that it limits
Grinnell's chances of winning alli-
letic contests, by taking away the
opportunity of entering athletes
at any time duringtheyear, whrle
the Olhercolleges‘of the state still
have that privilege. There seem
to be three values which vict0iy
in athletics has; hrst.-it iurnisltes
agoal toward which the individual
athlete may work, and thus keeps
up the interest in athletics; scc-
0nd,7il‘ makes the college es-
teemed by' outsiders; third, it
serves as an advertisement. Uns
der the new regulation the ﬁrst of
these values will not be changed;
there will be still the same goal
toward which to work. In regard
to the second it can be said that it
is perfectly legitimate (or every
student to desire to have his col-
lege ranlc ﬁrst in every hue oi
work it undertakes, and thus be
esteemed by outsiders. but the es-
teem which comes ironi Victory.
in athletics comes only trout a
small class and not from those to
whom a college means the most.
The third value which comes from
winning, and the most important
one, is the advertisement which it
gives the college. it admit)! be
denied that victorious
teams ate good advertisements,
but yet there are but few students
