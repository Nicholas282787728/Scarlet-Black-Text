Statement of Business Manager.

The season or 1899 has been pee
culiar in many respects. Many
dl'ﬁ-icullies. unforeseen and uns
avoidable, have arisen to complis
cate matters. The early part of
the season was disrupted by a
necessary change at schedule,
which at that late date made the
arrangement or proﬁtable games
ahard matter. Nevertheless up
to the ﬁnal game at the season.
Thanksgiving day at Omaha, the
results were all that could be
asked. As all know, that day was
oneof the worst that could be
imagined from the standpoint or
football. Had the day been what
it promised up to the morning of
the game, our ﬁnancial situation
would be 2i different story. Tak-
ing all things into consideration,
we have fared much better than
might have been expected under
similar circumstances.

The management wishes to ex
press it's hearty thanks to all
those who have so generously
contributed in money or work for
the success of the Grinnell team.

The merchants, with their usual
liberality and in spite of the fact
that this year has been one which
has placed upon them special calls
for contributions to the college.
have aided us in our football lurid
freely. We are also greatlyin-
debted to the students and alumni
for the support that has been give
en the team and all connected
withit. Ithas been greatly ape
preciated.

The recent election has placed
the business interests of the '00

team in worthy and competent
hands,.and we bespeak tor the
new manager the same hearty
support and encouragement which
has been given the present incum
bent of that ofﬁce.
