it is not possible at this time to
give a deﬁnite outline of the per

that the Ethiopian specialists will
decorate the City at the proper
time, in a brilliant Carmine hue.
There is in the College and town
this year unusually large
amount of material tor a guod
“circle," giving promise of an ex-
cellent chorus. In addition tothe
regular features of a minstrcl

costumes, it is promised will be or
very audible pattern and the gyrr
ations of the performers a delight
to the eye. The College band is
rapidly progressing and will, it is
believed, assist very materially in
advertising the aFfalr. It is also
proposed to have Trainer “Jack”

Society Friday eveningwasser-
lotlsly interfered with by preparar
tlotls [or the Seniot‘rSophomore
party. The society had to beheld
in the chapel instead of the hall
and not half of the members were
present with an especial scarcity
of Seniors and Sophomores. It
seems a shame that with a week
to prepare for a party, the society
well: should have to be so absor
lately dernoralrzed by it.

An extcmporaneous program
had been arranged for the after
noon and was carried out as plane
ncd notwithstanding the noise in
the gymnasium below and the
sound at preparations in the hall
above which prevented the speak~
crs being easily heard.

Externporancous music was tur.
ntslled by Nellie Clarke and Cynr
lhlit Meyer, Miss Clarke's song
being especially enjoyable.

Orplia Pcttit gave a short talk
on "Household Ecunom sin Cul-

lege.” "Mr. Martin and His Lecr
tures" was very ably discussed
and reviewed by MargaretSeaman.
Evelyn Wilson spoke on the pres»
ent condition in France, Miss
Mamie Spencer in her talk on the
situation in the Philippines show-
ed a very good knowledge oi
current history and he: talk was
one at the best on the program.
The last partotthe proglam was
an extemporaneous debate—“Res
solved, That Fraternities Would
be Advantageous tor Iowa Col»
lope." Helen Mrllerd supported
the afﬁrmative, May Parker the
negative The debate was decide
ed in (over of the latter. although
both speeches were very good.
Next Friday a farce will be given
written by Marion Bruritiett. rgoo.
