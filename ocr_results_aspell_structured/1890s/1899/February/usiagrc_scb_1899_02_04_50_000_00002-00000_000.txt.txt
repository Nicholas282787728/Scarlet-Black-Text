TOMORROW AFTERNOON President
Gates will begin a series of talks
to the students on religous ques»
tions which will without doubt be
proﬁtable to all. Although the
individual student here has great
er opportunities to come in direct
personalfcontact with the college
president than has the student in
larger institutions, yet with the
exception of Friday morning
chapel and some other special oc-
casions, the talks which are given
by the president solely for the
students are indeed few. This is
a fact to be deplored. The preSr
idcnt through his larger amount
of experience should be able to
help the students greatlyinthc
little difﬁculties which arise in his
lite, There are many troublesome

_questions which come up in the
lite of every student especially in
regard to religous matters and the
conduct of his own life, and it
indeed will be surprising it in this
series of talks much help can
not be obtained either in the way
of solving such problems as are
naturally common to the minds
of all students, or in suggesting
new lines of thought to be follow-
out. Although these talks will
have been carefully worked out
by President Gates and wlll be an
expression oi his own views on
the various subjects which are
taken up, yet there will be noth-
ing tormal about these Sunday
afternoon gatherings and it is to
be sincerely hoped that a large
number of students may be inter
ested and attend, The gleaning
which the student makes from the
diﬂerenttalks and addresseslvhich
he is privileged to hear each yea.
should be one of the best prepar-
ations for his life after college
days are past.

THE nAlxwaeather and general

- hard luck last spring put the Ath—

letic Union badly in debti The

penses, thus reducing a large part
ot the debt, but it still amounts to
one hundred and ﬁfty dollars.
which must be paid in some way
or other. An entertainment for
the beneﬁt of the Union would
help some, but how much. de
pends entirely on the students
It would hardly pay the commit-
tee to arrange an entertainment if
it were not to be better attended
than was the one held last spring.
If the committee appointed by
the Union yesterday arrange tor
an entertainment it will be well
worth any one’s time to go and
every student should be present,
There is another way the students
might help. The Athletic Union
dues (or the second semester of
this year are now due and they
ought to be paid immediately.
Those who take the gymnasium
work will have to pay the dues
beioie beginning the work. but
those who do not enter the gym-
nasium ought by all means pay

their dues and help the Union .

that much. All the the students
are interested in the welfare of the
athletics in the college and are ale
ways ready to ﬁnd iault if victory
does not come our way, but they
tail to recognize the fact that they
are to a considerable degree re-
sponslble tor the success oi the
athletic teams and are always
ready to shirlt when asked to
help,

The bequest ot Henry L. Pierce
to Harvard will be devoted to the
erection ot a new building. Two
thirds of the new building will be

used by the Division ot Engineers
and the remainder devoted to the
general use ot the college. The
bequest amounts to Sl75 000.
