THE FIRST important game of the
season is a thing of the past, and one
defeat is placed to the credit of our
eleven. There is no need to say that
this defeat is the cause of no little dis»
appointment. It seems to be the
general verdict among all who saw
the game, that the weaker team won.
However, it is not our intention to
make any excuses, as there are none
to offer, We hope that the members
of the team will awake to a sense of
their responsibilities, and by hard and
and trnited work overshadow this one
defeat by a goodly number of vic-
tories. There is one thing, however,
which should be mentioned in this
connection, and that is the apathy
displayed by the majority of the stu-
dents with regard to the team. Since
the Knox game a general atmosphere
of “I told you so" has been discerni»
ble, arid the feeling of satisfaction
over gratiﬁed predictions seems to
take precedence over any other. This
is hardly in accordance with the Grin—
nell traditions which we cherish from
year to year. It used to be our boast
that Iowa College always stood back
of her teams, and that a defeat was
felt just as keenly by the student-
body as by the team. This hardly
seems to be the casein the present in
stance. The attitude of the students
during the whole year has been open
to this same criticism of indifference,
Only a scattering handful have
watched the regular practice. When
we had our ﬁrst practice game a few
weeks ago, by which the ﬁrst oppor-
tunity was given to see the work of
the team, the attendance was chiefly
noticeable for its absence, alld enthu-
siasm was of a microscopic quantity,
On next Saturday our team is to play
the State Normal on the home
grounds. The game will be a hard
one. The Normal team has the ad-
vantage in weight, and has been under
the direction of a good coach. There

 

is no doubt that Grinnell will have to

put forth her very best etiorts to hold
her ground. it would be an inspira—
tiou to the team and a good thing for
the college if the sidelines might be
crowded and a little of the old enthur
siasm shown. It is enthusiasm which
wins football games, as was shown by
the Ames game in ’97. For the bener
ﬁt of those who have thus far had
little opportunity for learning, we
might state that our college colors are
scarlet and black, and that the college
yells may be ascertained by reference
to the handbook. it is to be hoped
that both might be in evidence.

WE ARE glad to see that Ames has
taken a prominent stand in favor of
pure athletics, Her paper, the l. S,
C. Student, has repeatedly spoken in
favor of such a position and has rea-
son to feel gratiﬁed at the action
taken by the Athletic Council at
Ames; namely, the refusal to play
Drake ulrtil there renrains no taint of
professionalism there. By taking this
step Ames has become a strong sup-
porter of the element in favor of pure
athletics. The encouragement and
aid that this action gives lowa City
and Grinnell cannot be over estimated.
While the University and Grinnell
were doing what they could, and in-
tended to do so irrespective of the
action of other schools, nevertheless
the support of otrr leading rival comes
most opportlinely. With the three
leading schools working together with
a common end, much should be ac
complished. Credit should also be
given the colleges throughout the
state who have, but with one excep-
tion, endorsed the action of Grinnell
and Iowa City. One cannot brlt
take an optimistic view of future ath-
letics in Iowa when the schools of the
state are so united for purifying ath-
letics.

The regents of the State University
have established a chair of physical
culture, with Dr. Knipe as professor.

This will be a great help ﬁnancially
to the Athletic Union there.
