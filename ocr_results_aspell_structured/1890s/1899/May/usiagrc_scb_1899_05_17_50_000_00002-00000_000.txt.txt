IE last isstie of Scanner
AND tit/ice was published a copy
of the athletic cotnpact which has
been adopted by the State Uant'r'
sity and town College. No one
wlto isatrue friend of athletics
can help feeling rejoiced that such
an agreement, which has been
needed [or so long a time, has at
last been reached. For many
years charges and COlIlIiereCllﬂlgES
of hiring athletes have been going
back and tortli bet‘wecn these the
institutions and the other colleges
composing the Iowa IIIIelCUllegle
ate Athletic Association, and it is
a source of great satisfaction that
steps have been taken to remove
all future difﬁculties on this
ground. [tis to be hoped thattlie
other colleges of the state may
join heartily in this effort after
purity in athletics. It has been
often said that Iowa City and Gritt-
nell. the two leading colleges in
the athletics of the state, should
be the foremost in any movement
of this kind, but now that they
have taken the lead it is only right
that they receive the support of
the other members of the associa
tion. This compact was not
tramcd in any domineering spirit,
as has been charged, but simply
as the easiest way to arrive at the
desired end. Gtiunell and Iowa
City have determined to do away
with professionalism once and for
all, and have made an agreement
to that effect, in which they invite
the other colleges of the state to
join. Whether they do so oi not
is their own affair, but it' is to be
hoped that they will, as there is
nothing in llteagrccment which rs
not perrectly open and above
board, and also in view of the [act
that the future of the association
hangs rrpon their decision.

representing the State University,
Cornell Penn and Iowa College.

At the present writing, 5. U. I,
would appear to have the best of
the argument in doubles at least.
as representatives or that school
recently defeated Cornell in a dual
tournament.

In the singles, I’eiin ought to
prove a winner, as it will be rep
resented by Ellis, last yea s
champion. Tennis, however, is
proverbially uncertain, and
certain predictions can be made.

In view of the fact. of the many
other attractions which have been
and are still to be in G‘rinuell this
spring, the management has de-
cided to adopt the Y, M. C. A.
plan or admission. Seats will be
provided about the courts for the
spectators, and no effort will be
spared to make the tournament
pass on smoothly.

The (act that’ no admission fee
is to be charged, does notdo away
with the fact that the association
is in need of money.

The Y. M. C. A. plan does not
mean a free entertainment by any
means, and it is hoped that no
one may so construe it,

Last year, Grinnell's represent
atives brought it about that the
state tournament should be held
here regularly. in view ol the fact
that this is the most central point
and in the hope that it might be
a paying investment to lucmc the
tournament in one place. If we
are to make this arrangement
satisfactory, ive must give the

tournaments ﬁnancial support.
without mentioning the {act that
it is the rigllt ot the men who are
to represent Iowa College to to
eetve ﬁtting encouragement from
the “‘slderlines",

It is to be hoped that the tour-
nanient may not be a tailttre on
account ot Iack ot support by the
students.
