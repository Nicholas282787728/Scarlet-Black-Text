WE are much pleased with the
interest a great many are showing
in the coming debate with Cornell,
and we hope it will continue and
spread among the rest of the stun
dents. It the students would turn
out in large numbersto the debate
our speakers would feel that they
have some support whether they
win or lose and on that account
would do much more credit to
themselvesand their college.
There seems no reason why our
debating teams should not he
supported and applauded as well
as an athletic or any other teams,
and if they received only half the
support we would have debating
teams to be proud of even as we
have athletic teams which are our
glory. The winter term ends at
Cornell Friday and many will
make it a point to be here that
night to hear the debate. A dele-
gation of a hundred or more is
expected, so that patriotic Grin-
nellites must turn out in order to.
at least, equal their force. We
think we ought to be able to make
the number of Cornellians look
small beside of our representa-
tion, but to do so we must attend
in larger numbers than when
the debate was held here two
years ago. The debate was to
to have been held in the M. E,
church, but it has been thought
best, for various reasons, to hold
it in the Opera House. Seats
have been reserved on the north
side for the Cornell delegation
and our students have been re-
serving their seats on the opposite
side of the house. Let us see that

' the invitation to attend the regu-

 

tne debaters are well applauded.
