THE DEBATE is over and again
victory has cometo Cornell. We
have no excuses to offer. The
debate was ﬁercely contested
throughout, and at the close the
audience was to no (leglee certain
whom thejudges would pt onottnce
the winners, The work of our
representatives was a credit both
to themselves and to the college.
and the students ate deeply in-
debted to them for the hard and
conscientious labor which they
have expended. Moreover, the
spirit and enthusiasm which has
been shown by the students them-
selves the past week is highly
commendable, and tlle size of the
audience last night showed how
much interest was taken in the
debate. It is just such a spirit as
this which will win victolies for us
in the future, and it was the lack
of this spirit which lost debates
[or us in the past. The thing to
be accompished now is to have
this interest kept up, and if this
result can be attained we can rest
assured that in the ltitute Grinncll
will never be ashamed of the part
it takes in intercollegiate dthdles.
There are dlways men in college
who have the ability to mike \Vin-
hing debaters, and ii the proper
interest is taken in such \VOlit' by
the students these men can be per
suaded to take part in the debates,
This spring should see society
work at its very best and inter
society debates should nt nilce be
begun, so that More the close of
the year a list of dehntct-s can be
made out, from whom the three
will be chosen who tvtll represent
Grinnell in the debate next year,

The debt of the Athletic Union
of S. U. I. has been reduced from
Elzooto 5675 during the year,

Mr. w. E. Leonard’s Pamphlet.

lustrations, entitled TIM Eva/Mimi
c/n Pthxlrm Town, by w, E Leone
ard. '99. The paper was written
originally for a one of the sociole
ogy courses, and is a study of Mr,
Leonard’s own town, Correction
vtlle, as atypical example of the
small town of the middle west.

The niainvaltte of the Work, per
liaps, is in the fact of its being an
addition to a rapidly growingbody
of similar community studies
which is Coming to have an lmr
portant place in the equipment of
the departments of sociology tn
the ldrgel universities. in ttnie
these collecllons furnish a
body of rehabie data which Will
undoubtedly be of great. value in
the preparation of more Importuni
and extensive studies in social
science.

The tlature oi the pamphlets
represented by Mr. Leonard's pro-
duction is scientiﬁc iil that they
are records at actual historical and
contemporary iacts, veriﬁed by
careful research, deﬁnite and tell-
able in their statements The
studies attempt little beyond this,
