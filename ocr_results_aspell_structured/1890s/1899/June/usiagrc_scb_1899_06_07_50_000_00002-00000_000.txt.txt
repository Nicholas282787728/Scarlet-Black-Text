Till: tuituv pleasures and advanc
tages of commencement week are
such that no student can anortl to
miss them unless it is positively
necessary. lowa College has al-
ways been fortunate in securing
commencement speakers of extra»
ordinary tvortli, and this year isno
exception. Mayor Jones, of To-
lcdo, hasgained a wide reputation
by his honest, straightforward ad-
ministration,and now l‘anksamong
the ﬁrst ot the municipal retorm-
ers of the country. This address
alone will well repay'any student
for temaining ill Grinnell during
the extra time, not to mention the
other opportunities which the
week affords, including the pre-
Sentation of “As You Like It,”
'uie promenade concert given by
,the Glee Club, the commencement
concert. the baccalaureate sermon,
and the addresses to be delivered
"by Dr. Herron before the Young
Meiis and“Young Women's Chris-
tian Associations, alid by Mr. C. C.
Carstens before the Alumni Asses
ciation. Taken as a whole the
week makes a ﬁtting close to the
year's hard work. and all who are
able should reap its beneﬁts.

Y. M. C. A. Notes.

work among their fellow students.
and to open up the possibilities or
christian sc‘rvice which await them
after graduation.

The inﬂuence of this gathering
has increased many fold the power
and efficiency of the association
work. Grinnell should be repre—
sented by a good strong delega-
tion. scveral men have already
made plans to attend, and should
there be more who could go, they
are requested to speak to the
president ot the association at
once. The strength and efﬁci.
ency of our work next year will
depend largely on the power and
enthusiasm the men receive at
Geneva.
