Now that tile second semester
is at hand it is time to begin to
think seriously ol uur spring track

walk. That ue may be prepared
to do effectual work when spring
opens up and we can get out on
the track, it is necessary tllat we
do some gymnasium work, The
fact that we are to have a new
gymnasium Should not induce us
to shun the old one until we can
actually use the new one.

The,Alllletic Union will take
charge at the gymnasium and
make it as usernl as possible.
There is none too much ttme now
to get in condltion for the spring
work. So all who have the least
ideaofworklng on thetrack Should
begin work m the gymnasium rm,
medialely. While our gymnar
sium is tar from being adequate to
our needs, it is as good as it ever
was, and the track men of former
years have put themselves in good
condition by working in it, and
there is no reason why we cannot
do the same this year.

If we do not do good, consist-

 

ent work the rest of this term, we

cannot expect what outdoor work.

we get in the spring to pull us
into such shape that us \vtll be
ableto uin our [ruck meels agatnst
the strong learns that nearly all
ot our rrval schools are cxpccled
to put into the ﬁeld. Our trainer
will be here about Aprll lst. and
it is hoped that we may have a
largc number of men in working
trim to put under [its care. In
order that this may be done there
must be no tlnte lost in getting to
work, for one cannot put himself

in good condition rrr a day or a

week.

The legislature of Maryland has
appropriated for the use of John
Hopklns University the sum of
550.000 a year for two years, \\'l|h'
out Condlllons. So that for the
present the University can con-
tinue its work without contraction
to its activities or reduction of its
teaching torce.
