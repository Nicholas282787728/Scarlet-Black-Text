Grinnell Institute

That society work is no longer
to be made n nlcre snbor‘dlnnte
matter, was clearly shown by the
Wednesday evening meeting oi
the Grinneli Institute; for in spite
oi the CullCCll at the church the
attendance was quite large, and
the program rendered was at unr
usual merit.

The leading ieatm-es of the
weclr were ﬁrst summed up by
Chase. This feature of the pro
gram uith preparation be
interesting, as was
shown by the way in which the
gentleman handled his subject.
Ziegler followed with a paper
upon “Out National Music." His
subject was novel, and this {act
together With the extreme origir
nality of the production made
this number a very enjoyable one.

The music committee has been
instrumental in scctning thus far
at least especially good music,
Miss Atkinson entertained the
society with a vocal solo. The
audience however would not be
denied the pleasure of hearing
her a second time.

Dignan discussed the results of
the Pcacc Conlel'cnce in a very
instructive way. He took an opti-
mistlc view of the subject and
maintained that we may look tor
larger and more deﬁnite results
along this line in the near future.
The regular debate was upon the
question, “Resolved; That Eng
land should adopt a preterential
tariff.” Robinson favored this
tat-in, while Davis extemporar
neously argued against it. The
discussion was very interesting
and strictly to the point. Davis'
extemporaneous defense was the
teature or the evening, but Robin-
son'sarrangementofpointsﬁnally
prevailed and won the debate,

Delavan’s comet solo and the
encore which he played at a very

can
lnndc vcry

 

decided request ot the audience
were very much enjoyed.

Extcnipornneously. Stevens
spoke on "Cuirenl Fiction." His
knowledge ol the subject was on-
limited. Peterson described the
u'esteln trip which PiC5ldCl‘K Mc-
Kinley is making, while the suilr
ject assigned Craver was “The
Inauguration of Pres. McLean."

At the next meeting of the
society Crandall will be tried on
a charge or “stufﬁng the ballot"
in the election of chaplain, which
was held Oct. 4.

Hw—

Calocagathi .

The subject of the Calocagatllia
program Friday atteiiieon was
"European Peasantry.” The pro
gram was opened by music by
Mrs.Vlttum,wllosangtwo charm»
ing songs which were very much
enjoyed.

“Russian Peasantry" was the
stibyeet otn talk by Anne Curry.
A description was given of the
condition and trio of the peas-
ants, both before their emancipa-
tion and as they now are.

Miss Edna Brnlcy then read an
interesting selection from one of
Tolstoi’s books, "What We Livt:
By," which was listened to With
close attention.

The second musical number of
the program was by Mr. Mac-
artncy, who sang “Beauty’s Eyes"
and "Little Boy Blue." None of
the singers who appear on Calo-
cagathia‘s program are more en»
joyed than is Mr. Macartney.

Grace Douglass treated the sub-
jectof “Flench Pcasantry,” giving
also a short reading irorn Alcott’s
description at them. Miss Doug-
lass is a very ready speaker and
her talk was very good.

The subject for next Friday
afternoon is on “Actors." There
will also be a series oi Lnbleallxr
