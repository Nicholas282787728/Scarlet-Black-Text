of the past term so helpful and
effective. Misses Anna Field and
Lulu Williams were then asked to
conduct the newly elected presi

chair. In her opening remarks
the new prestdent exhorted the
members to new energy and et-
fort,especta1ly during the spring

Let every member heed these

 

admonitions, and certainly the

Basket Ball Associatlon.

The girls of 1902 have organ-
ized a Basket Ball Association.
Its object. as the name indicates.
is to tutlier the somewhat lagging
interest in that game, Although
a considerable amount of enthuse
iasm has been manifested. it is
feared it may be of the kind that
will die out under the stress of
continual work in practice games
Grinnell is famed for her athletics
all over the State. Why can not
the girls wear the Scarlet and
Black on the ﬁeld as will as the
the men? Let the girls of tgoz
exert themselves to the utmost to
make this Basket Ball Association

In success.
