is published by undergraduates
and perhaps primarily tor under
graduatcsit is the only source the
alumni have of getting news die
rectly trom the college and cons
cerning their fellow alumni. For
this reason for the past few years
a department under the.hcading,
“Alumni" has been published, at
tempting to give as much intere
estiog news about the alumni as is
possible to gather. This depart
ment most, ot course, be edited
by an undergraduate and one who
is in direct contact, probably,
with but few alumni. Much of
the news must be obtained from
indirect sources and thus an occar
sional mistake is bound to occur.
Besides great difﬁculty is often
met with in obtaining enough
items to ﬁll one column. Out of
nearly seven hundred alumni
there surely ought to be enough
activity to ﬁll one column twice a
week with interesting items. We
therefore urge all alumni to send
to the alumni editors all interest-
ing' news about themselves or
others with whom they may be in
communication, and thus make
this department answer the pur-
pose for which it was inttnded.

THERE Is one matter which we
feel we ought to bring to the no
tice of the student body at this

time. That is. student support of
the Grinnell merchants, We are
an institution rather small in numr
bers and have to compete in athr
letics and along other lines with
institutions which have from two
to ﬁve times the number of stue
dents we have. Also most of the
colleges with which we compete
have towns behind them much
'larger than Grinnell to which they
may look tor support. Now as to
the pertinence of the above state-
ment to our subject. When we
have a coach or a trainer to payv
the college papers to support,
medals tor ﬁeld day to be bought,
or want contributions for a new
men’s gymnasium. to whom do we
look? The ﬁrst thing that Is done
is to go to the merchants and bus
iness men ot»the city and put
our proposition bctorc them and

same. Never has there been any
appeal for support made to these
men which was not responded to
generously. We doubt if there is

United States which supports the
college in all of the departments
more liberally than does Grinnell
and this 0t course must Come
largely from the business men.
Reasoning_trom the above facts
we can easily see that the business
men at Grinnell have more calls
tor aid and respond more genera
ously than do those of most other
college towns, Now what are we
going to do? Buy all we can or
Chicago houses and outside ﬁrms
simply because in some instances
we can get the goods a few cents
cheaper? This would not seem to
be the consistent thing to do.
Rather let each and every student
realize what we owe to the busi-
ness men for their support of our
institutions and act accordingly.
As a whole we think the students‘
support Grinnell merchants very
well but there are a few who do
not realize how conditions are
and to those these remarks are
especially addressed. ~

The Ellis society began the real
work of the term yesterday atter-
