THAT EXAMINATIONS in Grinitell
are not a mere matter of form, as
is often stated by the instructors,
is well~shown by the experiences
of the past week. The examina-
tions of this past semester seem
to have rested lar more heavily
than is usual upon the students;
rlot so much because of their ditr
ﬁculty as of their length. If the
instructors in the various subjects
do not have a good idea at the
end of the semester of the quality
of work a sttldent has been doing,
without giving an
which covers all the points which
have been discussed in the class-
room as well as a few which have
not been touched upon, then there
is great need of reform some
where. Most of the laculty will
admit that the value of examinas
tions is slight, but nevertheless
they continue in their evil way oi
asking at the end of each half-
year tor an extended review ot
the subject that has been studied
during that period. As to what
is to be accomplished by the use
of such excruciating tests it is difr
ﬁcult to state. They surely will
not incite the students to greater
efforts during the semester. II
that were the object desired. time-
ly drop~examinations would far
better accomplish the purpose,
Neither do we think that they will
serve to show exactly what the
student has gotten otit of the
coursc, but rather of the amount
of work he has done in the few
days previous to examinations.
If, however, it is desired to have
the students think that they are
under a set of tasksmasters and
that they will have to work night
and day it they expect to pull
through, and if it is desired to
give them something to think and
to worry about. then examinations
are without doubt highly bene»
ﬁcial.

Basket Ball.

The game of basket ball played
at the gymnasium Friday after
noon resulted in a score of 27 to
iz in favor of the freshman team.
The other team was composed of
players from two or three classes.
as the sophomores were unable to
accept the challenge of the fresh
men. The game was played very
well. and few fouls were made
considering the small amount of
practice the girls have had and
the number who were entirely un~
used to the game.

There are many at the new girls
who would he glad to play and
who would make ﬁne players, it
the girlswlio have played before
would push the matter a little and
organize teams. Basket ball is
surely too good a game to be alr
lowed to die out after such a blief
trial as it has had here, It is not
designed for a [ad but should be
made a regular thing tor the girls
as football and baseball are for
the boys. The girls need some
thing to take the place of gymna-
sium work alter the spring has
opened, and basket ball supplies
this need fully; and beside fur-
nishing 2t healthful exercise, it de-
velopsthe players in seltcontrol
and in other useiul qualities. Why
can we not have some classgames
this coming spring such as we had
in the season ot '97. There is
surely-as much time tor it now as
there was then. We should have
occasional games in the gymna.
sium until the spring term, and
thensome good,heavy.classrteam
work, and we will see if the class
of igoo continues to hold the
championship.

The Students‘ Christian Asso»
ciation are endeavoring to secure
Dr. Graham Taylor of Chicago to
lecture.
