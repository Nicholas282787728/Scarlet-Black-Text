Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. Reception.

On last Saturday evening the
old students, through the kindly
mediation of the Christian Asso-
ciations, took the opportunity to
extend the hand of good fellows
ship to those who are acquiring
their ﬁrst experiences ct college
lite The chapel. which ivas taster
lully decorated with scarlet and
black hunting and an abundance
of autumn flowers, was ﬁlled to
overflowing with students and lac-
ulty stiiving after a better ac-
quaintance.

The guests were ieceivcd by
Miss Rand, Mr. Greer and Miss
Spencer, the presidents of the two
associations, and Mr. Engellre and
Miss Clarke. the heads of the see
cial committee. According to a
custom inaugurated last yeai, the
committee had attempted to do
away with all tnrmality by are
ranging that each old student
should be accompanied by a new
one ot the opposi‘e gender. whlle
all were armed with cards- bcaiing
their own names with places lor
the names of others. Front
appearances, the experiment was
successful, and much of the stiff-
ness common to such occasions
was obviated.

During the evening short talks
were made by Pres. Gates and
Frof.[’arl<er, interspersed by music
by the glee club,

The reception was most enjoy

Ward Field.

During the summer Ward Field
has been enlarged by the addition
of ﬁve acres on the cast and south
sides. This addition will enable
us to have a third-mile track, with
a straightaway hundred and twenr
ty yards. This will be
banked on all the curves, so that

all

the bicycle races can bc held on
it. When it is completed we will
be able to hold all out ﬁeld meets
there, which will he a great ad
vantage, doing away with rent for
the {air grounds, and at the same
time giving us a place much more
acc 'blc,

There will he some changes in
the arrangement of the ﬁeld. One
plan. which has been suggested, is
to have the amphitheatre moved
to the north side of the track,
having the ﬁnish from east to west
and the diamond face
south, \\ill\ wire netting in front
of the stand for a backstop. This
plan would give the diamond the
best location possible and would
be tully as iciisible tor track and
football purpnscs

The fence ha»: been taken down
and removed in the new boundr
ai-ics but has not been rebuilt.
The men in charge of this are
anxious to ﬁnish it at once, and
every man should get out and as-
sist whenever requested to do so.
Notices be posted, stating
when work will be done, and who
will be in charge of it.

These proposed improvements
will ﬁll it longrfelt want and will
give Gi-inncll an athletic ﬁeld the
equal, if not the superior. of any
college in the West, The thanks
of the college is due to the trttsr
ices whose generosity has made
these changes possible.

Men’s Gymnasium.

The men’s gymnasium is not so
near completion as we hoped it
would be. but the prospects of its
being ready tor use this year are
a little brighter than formerly.
Contracts covering the brick, ear-
penter and sheet metal work have
been let. llulti providing tor the
enclosing of the building. Saturn
day the trustees voted to arrange
for heating the building this win-
ter. and they are now negotiating
the contract for the heating ap-
paratus. This action will enable
the classes under Mi: Davis to use
the building about November tst,
although they may be Without the
necessary apparatus foi
time.

It will be decided within a short
time whether or not the contracts
for the plumbing, will be let this
fall. The unexpected delay in

some

 

the completion or the building
has been caused solely by the un,
expected rise in the building ma-
terial. and by the difﬁculty which
attended the securing of it, This
entailed fresh efforts to raise
money to cover the additional ex-
pense, as well as tedious delay in
securing material. The building
committee has put forth their best
efforts, and the students may rest
assured that the date of the open-
ing ot the gymnasium will be the
earliest possible one.

Faculty Changes.

Several changes in the lowa
College faculty took effect with
the opening oi the school ,i cur.

The trustees have selected M.

Mr. W. W. Davis takes the par
sition of physical director. Con-
cerning Mr.Davis the Hrm/dsays:

"Prof. Walter W, Davis, of the
Department ct Physical Educa-
tion for Men. has taken hold of
the work with a zest that insures
good work. Mr. Davis has re
ccived the degree oi A. B rrom
Leland Stanford ],. University,
has served as principal of the
Montour public schools and has
spent two yeais at Yale Univer-
sity in the lineof liisspecial work
here. He has written a thesis for
tlle degree of Ph. D. in Yale, which
has been received and will give
him the degree on the expiration
ot the school year. With this
high standing in scholarship, Mr.
Davis takes up the long neglected
work of giving careful attention
to the physical welfare ot the gene
tlemen of the college. The work
for the ﬁrst month will be limited
to taking the measurements, utter
which it is hoped that the old
armory may be used till the new
gymnasium is‘ ready tor
pancy. This work is compulsory
tip to and including the sophOr

ular indoor work from Novembei
