Calocagathia.

The ﬁrst number on the pro-
gram was an instrumental duet by
Misses Gates and Wetn‘lore, of
which the society showed their
appreciation by an encore.

Instead ot the regular literary
program, Miss Mary Chamberlain

‘ told the glrls ot her trip to the
Hawaiian Islands. She began by
giving a short sketch ot their his
tory since the English ﬁrst went
there in 1821. and of their rapid
and wondcrtul development since
that time. Her description ot her
voyage to the islands and the life
on board a sailing vessel, wasboth
interesting and amusing. She
then gave an account of her vrsit
to the various islands and points
of interest, and of some of her
strange experiences. One of the
islands is devoted exclusively to a
community or lepers, where they
live under the best possible condir
tions and have a government or
their own.

The photographs which Miss
Chamberlain showcd helped much
in giving her audience avrvid idea
of the wonderlul scenery of the
islands, their luxuriant vegetation
and also of the natives of various
types. For every one who heard
the talk, the Hawaiian Islands and
their people took on a new interr
est and seemed a nearer neighbor
than before; and the society
wishes to thank Miss Chamberlain
tor her very instructive and enter
taining talk.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

alld concluded the work of the
pasltelln,speaking of“The Trend
of Events in the United States
During the Past Fifteen Years."
He ﬁrst spoke of the great emr
phasis laid on the labor question.
arising out of the advance in mans
utacture and the increasing coma
binations and trusts. The labor
unions have their place, and there
are also places where they do not
belong Organized labor is or-
ganized to ﬁnd labor for those in
the union, but it means assassinar
tion and great wrong to those out
of the union Socialistic combir
nations, such as the grange stores,
tail bccailsc they are too demo-
cratic to leave the management in
the hands of those who best unr
derstand the laws of trade. Thus
for this reason all the efforts at
communism have been unsuccessr
fill. Aristocratic communism may
succeed; democratic cannot.

The nc-gro question
question, When there are such
men as Booker T. Washington in
every county, then there will be
hope tor the solution or this prob-
lem. The duty of every negro rs
to work and pray for money, tor
when the negro has money in his
pocket, the race question will be
near solution.

coine an integral part of our gov-

we shall go zlg-zag, but as a peo-
ple we learn easily trom our blunr
dcrs. All political parties have
in view some good; the initiative

tried in South Dakota; the millen-
iurn is not yet conic—it is coming.

Ebenezer Alden.

Dr. James L, Hill, out new col-
lege trustee. always watchful for
everything of college interest,
sends us the tollowrng sad an-
trouncemenl:

“One of the original Board of
Trustees, (184771849) Rcv. Eben-
ezer Alden, died in Marshﬁeld,
Mass, on the 4th inst. His pas-
torate of ﬁve years in Tipton,
Iowa, hrs membership in the Iowa
Band, and his close association
with the founders of this state and
college, give him an undying memr
cry. Daniel Webster attended
Mr. Alden's church and It was the
dying wish of the great statesman
that his pastor should conduct the
funeral service. Many of the
pleasant things said ot Ml. Alden
at our festival lastsummcr, will be
at onci: recalled."

Dr. Alden was a descendant oi
the Mayﬂower john Alden and
Priscilla, a native of Massacllur
setts, a graduate of Amherst. actr
ing pastor at Marshﬁeld from 1850
to 1885, and remained there as
“pastor emeritus” until his death.
nearly eighty years old.
Only a strong man could have
held the place he occupied with
such distinction. or have won the
cordial regard of a Daniel Webs
ster.

In response to our invitation to
be present at the senllrcentennial,
he wrote in bold, shapely script,
of early college history, its founr
dation by home missionaries, of
their sending Father Turner east
to raise money for the institution
and paying his expenses out ot
smallest purses, and at his delight
in college progress. His closing
words were: “Let us give thanks
to God for what he has done
through Iowa College, and earns
estly hope and pray that this lion-
ored institution may ever remain

true to its early history, and faith
ful to Christ and his church."

The memory or those college
founders will ever be a benedicr
tion because it will ever be an in~
spiration. L. F. P.
