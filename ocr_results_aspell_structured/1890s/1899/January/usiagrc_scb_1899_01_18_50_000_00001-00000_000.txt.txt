or, chose toi- his subject “Expan-
sion”—ti-eatiiig the subject from
three points of View; Mr. Owen in
his turn spoke hull I'ously on sub
jects connected tvttli college life.

The subject for debate was,
“Resolved; that the practice of
giving ‘prlze nloney’ to ofﬁcers ot
the navy Should be discontinued."
Mr. Parker supported the afﬁrniar

Each speaker was given ten min.

minutes for rebuttal. The decis-
ion was given in tavor ot the at-
ﬁrmatitc.

Toward the close of the pro-

antly surprised by a visit [mm a
