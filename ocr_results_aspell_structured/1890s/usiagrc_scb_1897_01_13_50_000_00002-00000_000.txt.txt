THE COLLEGE has been forlti
nate the past week in the visit of
the noted evangelist, Rev. B. Fay
Mills. The privilege or hearing
and meeting the leading men of
the times is one which we enjoy
to a greater extent than any like
institution in the west. It cannot
but be a source of inspiration.

._L..__

WE ARE indebted to Mrs,
Blanche McMeans Carstens, ’91,
who sends us a long and interest
ing alumni letter. Mrs. Carstens
writes: “We want more alumni
news and we suppose that the best
way to get some is to give some."
We wish to extend our hearty
thanks, and to request others ol
Ithe Alumni to follow her example.
Few ot the alilmni seem to appre
ciate the difﬁculty ot securing in-
formation about alumni who do
not live in Grinrtell nor visit it of-
ten. Last year the letters (or the
quinquerinial were at the service
of the alumni editor and furnished
much information. but this year
the only source is in private lete
ters and such items as local alumr
hi can give us. Our aim is to
make the alumni column an epito-
me at the history of the graduates,
and to that end we ask more acte
live cooperation of those inter
ested. It means but a small sacr
riﬁce of time for you to send us a
newsy letter; it means a great
deal of pleasure to your classmates
and school friends,

Now THAT the joint debate with
Coinell appears to be assured, the
SCARLET AND BLACK hopes to see
an increased interest in society
work and more time devoted to
that important branch of our edur
cation, that our college may not

stiffer by contrast. A high stand»
art] of excellence has been set by
our predecessors in this matter,
and it must be ctinlcssed that (lure
ing the lust year at no time llztvc
\vc permitted ourselves tin earliest
et’lorl to reach that standard. The
winter session is the one [)l’eremir
ncntly suitable for society work,
for during that period less than
any other in the whole year are
we distracted by the other
elements of our college life. Sntr
ur-dhy evening sliotrltl be set apart
by every society member to be
devoted to this work, and this
alone. Only for the most cogent

reasons should this custom be de-

vrated from. A little forethought
will remedy the evil of nonrattend~
ance which of late has proven so
total to progress in our literary
endeavors. Ari ear-nest effort oii
the part of everyone interested to
make their inﬂuence felt in the
right'tiiiection, will produce such

. heneﬁcent results that it will not

be necessary when extolling the
virtues of our society work, tn rer

Joint Debate.

Cornell was heard from yesterr
day in regard to the joint debate.
They have accepted the question
submitted by Grlrlucll and chosen
the negative side. Their debaters
are R. W. Pratt, O. B. Waite, W.
A, Ganﬁeld and F. W. Hicks subr
stittrte. The question is, “Re~
solved, that the inter-e s of the
people of the U. S. are better
served by the system of govern
ment now in use by them than by
the English cabinet system."

Limitations:

1. The exisienee oi the Elig-
lisli Crown, the hereditary Holisc
of Lords and other hereditary
privileges are to be excluded as
nmrmative arguments.

2. The question is to be dis
cussed upon its merits and the
initial difﬁculties and friction
likely to he experienced in in,
auguraiing such a system in this
country are likewise to be exclur
ded as afﬁrmative arguments,

The preliminary debate to see
lect Grinncll's speakers will prob
ably occur some time in March
In this contest, Brown, Huff and
McHose will represent the Insti-
tute Society and Piner, Peck and
Williams the Chrestornathians
