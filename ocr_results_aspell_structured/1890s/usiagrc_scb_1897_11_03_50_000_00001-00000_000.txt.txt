COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA. WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER 3, 1897.

 

Aftermath.

ln commenting on Saturday's
game. much of credit and an equal
amount of criticism may be said
regarding the home team, Cerr
tain it is Grinnell never made a
pluckier ﬁght against overwhelm
rng odds. in tire words of Presi»
dent Gates “we were beaten four
times," but hung on to the bitter
end. The lesult only serves to
show liorv important is the spirit
with whlch a team entels a con»
test. There were few who ex-
pected Victory for Grinnell Satur-
day. We were outclassed in
weight and training, and every
thing pointed to our defeat. But
had the local braves been in pink
of condi on and entered the con-
test with anything but the desper-
ation which marked their work
throughout, victory would have
been impossible, Outside of this

thele is no logical reason why we

should not have been the van-
quished instead of the vanquish-
ers. True Grinnell was ably cap-
tained and was more active than
Anres, but all this would have
been mere chart in a gale betore
the terriﬁc onslaughts of the vis-
itors had not every man played
with tthat spirit that seldom
brooks‘defeat, and in defeat gives
the conquered greater claim to
glory than their conquerors, It
was merely a rejuvenation of the
old Grinnell spirit that has for
years crushed overwhelming odds
and made dcleat a steppiugrstone
to victory. Lct its trope that its
influence is not merely pa- ng,
but that it has come to stay; that
its subtle force wtll manifest itself
in the heart or every lowa college
student and there instill that reck-
less abandon which has been the
kcystonc of ‘past sncces

The failure of the visitors to
mccl’expectatlons was due largely
to overrconﬁdencer No more ins
sidiolls foe can enter the ratlks of
an eleven. ltisabsolutely inconr
patible with the true football spirit
and no team dominated by its ins
nuence can hope tor continued
success. The result of Saturday‘s
game should be a timely warning
to Grinncll. The season is by no
means ended and what seem some
of our easiest games may prove
stubborn surprises. Ol the S.U. I,
game this cannot be said for it is

 

certain as that the game will be
played that Grinnell rvill have to
do her best. S. U, L met some
hard luck Saturday but has been
noted in the past for the hurricane
rush ivith which she has often ﬁn»
ished the season.

The endeavor of every man
from now on should betostreugth-
en those points which he found
weak Saturday. To sheer despere
ation or more than to
team work Giirrnell owes its trie
umplr. We were at times lament
ably weak in stopping mass plays
while the tackling was several
notches below par. At times the
ball was advanced from ﬁve to
ﬁfteen yards when a clean tackle
would have ptrt a quietus on the
play. But for this the ball might
have been located a comfortable
distance from the danger line
when time was called instead of
haunting the goal with a persist-
ency that gave every spectator
palpitatron of the heart. It
true the men rallied at critical
times but it is safer to rally in the
center of the ﬁeld than ten yards
from the goal line, and consider
ing the case with which the visits
ors carried the ball over for the
ﬁrst touchdown there was no very
deﬁnite assurance 2 second would
not be similarly scored.

To our surprise our line’ plays
were more effective than and runs.
The ball was in Grinnell's possess
sion little of the time, and, with
the exception of a long run by
Gray. we made little ground
around the visitors’ ends. This
denotes weakness of interference,
and must be remedled if we are to
make a creditable showing against
S. U. I. and Drake. Not a print
tvzts blocked on either side, but
our lullrbaclt was several times
compelled to kick trom a very
light corner. the line men free
quently bearing dorvn on him with
a quickness that prevented low
kicking. Greaterspeed m‘. also
be developed. and there can be no
better indication that a team is
moving slowly than when its men
are tackled from behind, Perfec»
tion of oirr team work should be
thewatchword from now on, That
irnpli nothing short of the hard-
est kind of hard work,

Grinnell teeis proud of theeleven

The best football material Grins

A Letter from an Alumnus.
MAKSOVAN, Tunney,

REV. G. Ar GATES. D. 1)., LL. 1)..

Pt'estdent lowa college,

My Dmr 1: mirth-750mb
time since 1 received acopy ot
the Quinquennial Registerot lowa
College, which 1 read with great
tntereslt The record of work ac-
complished as seen in what the
alumni are doing is' certainly
cheering and inspiring. But it
occurred tome that the Register
trad one lack that might properly
be supplied, via, some suitable
mention of those who have studied
in the college wrthout completing
the course.

This opinion was emphasized
when I met Mr. W. W, l‘eet, our
misston treasurer in Constanti-
nople a few weeks ago. He was
for some time a student in the
college, and always inquires for
news frorri it With the affection of
ztn alumnus. Idoubtivhether Mr.
Feet 'ervioes in the Armenian
reliefof the last tito years have
met ally adequate recognition. In
this enormous work of getting
bread to scores if not hundreds of
thousands who were perishing, of
{unit ring clothing. a roof and
tools in a large proportion of
cases. in lnaccessible regions, and
with a hostile government. a marl
who has done more than anyone
else is Mr, l’eet. 5850.000 passed
through his ofﬁce last year. the
entire appropriations from the
Board bulllg some $70900, Mr.
Peel was not only the transmit-
ting agent of the relief funds; but
the information gathered from all
over Turkey in his ofﬁce and trans-
mitted to friends abroad by him.
was largely the cause of this
money being given. He has pull»
ed the laboring oar on the Cone
stantinoplc Relief Committee, his
associates being mostly English.
Heis today more trusted than
any other man in Constantinople,
I think there can be no doubt but
that is a sober fact. A great part
of the funds transmitted through
his ofﬁce have been sent by Ar~
menians abroad to their friends, a
priceless boon to them. One day
an Armenian tlictl to secure the
transmission of some money to an
obscure place where Mr. Feet lad
no convenient means or helping
him. and driven with a multitude
of cares for on into every night.
he dismissed the man somewhat
abruptly The inair turned and
begged not to be rejected, saying
“We've got no one left but God
and you."

It seems to me lowa College
should not forget such students.

I remain. Sincerely Yoii.s
