WE ARE pleased to announce
the election of H. H. Douglass,
’01, as captain of our next year’s
toorball team. Mr. Douglass is
certainly deserving of this honor,
his conscientious and taithinl work
in the interests of the team being
well known to every one. After
several years of hard work on the
second team, he earned his pres.
ent position on the varsity, and
during the past three seasons as a
regular varsity man, has played a
most consistent and at times bril-
liant game, in spite ot severe in;
juries. Faithlulness at practice
and willingness to tollow the di.
rections ot trainers and coaches,
are characteristic or tootball train-
ing.in which he has never been
lacking. Mr. Douglass has the
conﬁdence not only or every toot-
ball man but also of the entire
student body,

STUDENTS SHOULD not need urg»
ing to attend the Home Oratori~
cal ContestMonday evening. The
fact that the State Contest is to
be held in Grinnell this year
makes it all the more necessary
that we should give our lieartiest
support to those who are striving
tor honor in this department oi
of college activity. The list of
contestants is larger than common
and each having done an unusual
amount of work. the contest will
undoubtedly bespirited. The fol»
lowing are the contestant with
their respective orations: S. H.
Crosby, ’02, “Daniel Webster;"
D. G, McCarty, loi, “Alexander
Hamilton;“ Martha Fulton, ’02,
"L2wlessness;” R. H. Arnold, '02,
“Race Antagonism,” Susan Orvis,
‘00, “Direct Legislation;" J. T.
Velin, ’oo, “Personalityisocial
Energy.”

A SUBSCRIPTION list has been
circulated during the past week
by representatives of the athletic
union. As nothing has been said

in regard to it in these columns,
we will now take rtie opportunity
oi explaining its purpose. The
athletic union began the year
With a debt at $350, which was in-
curred last spring. However, at
the beginning of the season, it
looked as though, with the sched
ule arranged by Manager Burlew,
the debt might be easily wiped
out and all current expenses paid.
But thepast season has been an
unfortunate one as far as ﬁnances
are concerned. Tile manager has
had to face obstacle after obs

stacle in the way ot ﬁnancial suc~
cess. The Drake attair proved
the most disastrous to our ﬁnanc-
es. Of course this was to be ex»
pected as the two Drake games
in the past have been the best
paying games on the schedule, It
is needless to enumerate the
other difﬁculties which the man-
agement iaced and is sufﬁcient
for our purpose to say that at
present the athletic union is 8600
in debt, and it was (or the pur-
pose ot paying off this debt that
the subscription lists were circu-
lated. The union has met with
fair success with these lists and
a majority ot the men have
signed. But among the women
very little attention has been paid
to the matter. This we very much
regret, as we think that every
woman in school,just as well as
every man, should help support
our athletics. The sum stipulated
is not a large one and can cer-
tainly be paid in the time given
without much inconvenience. No
subscriptions have been taken for
a coach fund and this is the ﬁrst
time the Union has asked the stun
dents for money this season. In
view of these facts we think that
every man and every woman in
the college should consider it a
duty to sign these lists and assist
the Union materially in a time of
especial necessity.
