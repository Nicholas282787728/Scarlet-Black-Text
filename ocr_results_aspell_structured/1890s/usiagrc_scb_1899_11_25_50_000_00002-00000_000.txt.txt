THE DARK, cloudy days of the
past week have emphasized again
the need of having Goodnow
Hall lighted. For three days
students were unable to do any
work in the library after 4 o‘clock
on account of darkness This. tor
gether with the approaching short
days at winter, which make it in
possible tor the library to be used
until the closing hour, brings this
tact forcibly beforeusagain. That
lights are needed in the building
no one can deny. Prof. Buck has
evening classes in his room and
work in the observatory. Prof.
Herron's room is also used for evr
ening classes. Lights would add
much to the convenience of these
instructors, but the greatest need
oi them is for the library and
reading room. it the building
were lighted. both library and
reading room would, in all proba-
bility, be kept 'open to the stUr
dents tor evening work. s This
would not add materially to the
work of the librarian, as his work
at present requires hiln to be in
the building almost the entire ev-
ening. There isa constantly ins
creasing tendency for the instruc-
tors to insist upon library work
for their classes and students haVs
ing recitations during the alter-
noon are forced to take out refer
ence books for evening work.
Much confusion results from this
and the books are far from being
as usetul as they would be if they
were used entirely within the lie
brary. If the building were open
evenings to students, no period-
icals or. reference books would
need to be drawn, thus allowing
no one to have a book which is in
great demand lying about his
room. That students wish the
use of the library and reading
room evenings is shown by the
numerous complaints to tile li-
brarian. Alarge majority otthe
books taken out are drawn be-
tween the hours of four and ﬁve,
A number of students having
work in a department which re
quires the use of a great many
reference books requested the lie
brarian to open the building at 8
o'clock in the morning, stating as
