THE UNlT has received lately
several contributions in prose and
verse without signatures. In
such a case demerit has nothing
to do with the rejection, as we
positively can not accept anonyr
mous articles under any consider
ation. The name of thc contrib—
utor need not be published, but
must be made known to the edi-
tors betore anything is accepted

SCARLET AND BLACK for next
Saturday will be a football nurn~
her. It will containa complete
review of the season by a camper
tent critic, personal mention of
each member of the team, a cone
cise summary of football in Grins
nell since intercollegiate games
have been played; and other inter-
esting features. A haltrtone pho-
to-engraving ot the team will be
printed on a supplement, making a
number no loyal student will care
to be without. Extra copies will
be on sale at the usual price.

meo T0 the fact that the next
number will be entirely devoted to
football this is the last chance to
speak at the mass meeting called
tor next Wednesday evening to
consider the proposed amends
ments to the constitution ot the
Student Council. It is unneces-
sary to urge the students to be
present in large numbers as they
all recognize how important this
matter is. But we would ask all
to study carefully the constitution
and amendments and come pre
pared to speak clearly and to the
point, or to keep still. This will
expedite matters wondertully and
will tend to make the discussions
satisfactory in all respects.

ON FRlDrw evening,
o’clock, Rev. J. B. Koehne will
give his platform lecture, “Tile
New Aristocracy.” in the Congre
gational church. The admission
to this will be either by tickets,
which will sell atﬁlty cents apiece,
or the Y. M, c. A. plan will be
tried. Deﬁnite announcement as
to which method will be adopted
cannot now be made, but; will be
given ti-om the chapel piattorm.
