Before I leit the tent I met ProfeSr
sor Joe nigger who had under his dlr~
ection a minstrei company or twenty-
five colored people. Joe, again par-
don the iamiliarity, was the leader of
the band in the side show and was
busy rehearsing his galaxy of stars.

big top. Here surrounded by horns,
hand coats, and men 1 round 0. A.
Giison, the hand roaster of the circus.
itir. Gilson told me briefly of his ex-
periences with circus audiences and it
was quite interesting to here him tell
of the change in musicians who
travel with a circus. "The average
' musician today is far above what he
was tifteen years ago. This is due to
advanced pay and to conditions in
general."

Speaking of the kind or music which
appeals to circus goers, he said. ”We
have to gire a variety of music, there
is a class which demands the classi—
cnl. There are people who want both
and we must please the majority.

“Ererything is laid to fit each act.
This is accomplished by past exper-
ience. The most of the music is cued
to the center ring but sometimes
something important is going on also-
where and this must 'he played to."

The hand leader was anxious to get
his men ready tor the parade and so
i wandered toward the 'horsc tent,

New Colt "‘Griiliiell"

At the horse tent I found a newly
born colt, which was to he christened
Grinnell. The colt was a bit wobbly
but was receiving more attention tram
the crowd of circus folk and town peo-
ple than a water fountain on a hot
day. .

The hugle sounded for the parade
and the circus people began to dress
and were no longer just folks but
became actors in .all their trappings

 

 

Laxity In Enforcing Rules Held
Responsible For Professionalism

“If American colleges will not live‘

up to the mliateurism in athletics
which they profess, or publicly adopt
the professionalism which they prac—
tice, I submit that no college that pre-
tends to hold up moral standards be,
fore the young can take part in inter-
collegiate athletics."

Directing this sweeping charge and
challenge at college athletic policies
generally, President Hamilton Holt of
Rollins college, Florida, writing in the
Review of Reviews for May, has called
speciﬁcally for a clean-up in the
Southern Intercollegiate Athletic As»
sociation, with which his college is air
ﬁliated.

'Prosident Holt who came into prohi-
inence a year ago by dismissing nearly
a score of Rollins football players
whom he charged with receiving com-
pensation for their athletic activities,
discounts the many recent suggestions
of college authorities to curtail the
ioothall season, abolish gate receipts
and otherwise reduce the emphasis on
the cilief college game.

”The chief trouble .with football in

our colleges today,” he

so much the way in which the game
is taught or played, as in the tiniidity
and laxity of college authorities in
enforcing the standards they set."

Discussing his campaign to estab-
lish amateur-ism as well as theory, he
outlines his future policy at Rollins.

"If it is impossible to find enough
colleges geographically proximate to
play with under purely amateur con-
ditions, i am ready to suggest that we
abandon our pretense or amateur-ism
and come out open and above hoard
ior prolessionalism. I would he per—

quarterback and high jumper.

“What I object to is this hypocrisy
in pretending to one thing and doing
another. it is this disrespect and dis-
regard tor low which is demoralizing
our colleges, just as it is demoralizing
the country at large on other issues,"
his Review of Reviews article com
eludes.
