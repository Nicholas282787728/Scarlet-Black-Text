Zac Ellington: keepin’ Cleveland bumpin’

By MARCUS ZEI r;

You’ve seen him around campus.You'vc danced to his beats
in Cleveland lounge some Friday night. And perhaps you've
even cured afternoon munchies with it Sandwich from him at
Lonnski’s,

Zac Ellington '10, a POSSE scholar from LA, was thrust
into Grinncll culture when hc prospied during Mary B, James
weekend. The oppoitun‘ity to participate in transvestite den
bauchery ottered what Ellington called a “very
quick course in everything that is great about
Grinnell."

That weekend marks the beginning of El-
lington's love arrair with Grinnell, recentl
consummated with his return from studying
abroad in Aix en Provence, France.

While abroad, Ellington's apparent similare
ity to Bob Marley was a source of constant en-
tertainment. “I would meet people, and he like,
Tm zac,' and they would smile and say Tm going to call you
Bob,” Ellington recalled.

Once, when walking on a boardwalk with some friends
in Nice, a police car drove by with the windows rolled down,
singing “No Woman No cry," and smiling as they passed El-
lington.

But miles and ocean were not enough to separate Ellingr
ton from the school that he loves. After visiting Grinnellians
in Rome, Ellington ﬂew to Amsterdam. Alone and exhausted
on the concentric streets of Amsterdam, Ellington realized his
phone was dead and he was hopelessly lost. “I couldn't remem-
ber the difference between Lindenstraat and Linden staat," he
laughed.

Somehow, after two hours, he made it back to his hostel.
where to his surprise his friend, Juli Garcia '10, was in the lobby.
“Running into someone like that would have been the craziest
thing anyway, but the fact that it was in Amsterdam made it

die (if/own!"

that much crazier, Ellington said.

“Being abroad tor a semester really hclpcd me remember
how great this place is," Ellington said, “I was literally in para—
dise—southern Francciyet i wanted to return to the middle
of Iowa,"

Back in his bcloved Grinnell, Ellington, a Psychology major
with a concentration in Linguistics, has returned to hrs puss
sions: dancing, reading, and socializing.

In particular, Ellington said he hopes to
ensure that there is “a place available to dance
every weekend.” His per project, the Dance
Collective, aims to achieve just this by putting
on dance parties “as often as 1 can" in South
campus. Ellington personally ﬁnances many
of the parties, and is currently working on im-
proving his DJ skills with the aid othis friend
Robin Dugas '10. “A few nights a week we just
get together and spin for two to three hours,"
Ellington said.

When he's not in class, hanging out, or moonlrghting as a
D], Ellington works in town at Lonnski’s Pub and Deli,where
he serves sandwiches to the greater Grinncll community “it's
nice to see a real crossrsection of the town rather thanjust be-
ing around college students'hc said.

Beyond working in the deli, Ellington’s vocational plans for
beyond Grinnell include children's speech therapy. “My aca
demic passion is language, and i love working with children, so
itwould be great to go into a ﬁeld that combines both of those
things," Ellington said.

For now, though, Ellington is content to eat caramels as
he relaxes with his cat in the school he loves. “Self-governance
is, in my mind, what sets this school apart. 1 really do think
it's proof that people can subjugate themselves to nothing but
reason and get along well together," Ellington said. “Seeing it
work is a really rewarding experience,"

You think a bacon weave is too much? Think again.

Nora Coon ’1 O explores the ways Grinnell College students can enjoy bacon, counting down the top three locations

you rip to speed. The Bacon Explosion is a

log of meal, constructcd out of two pounds

ofbacon, two pounds ofsausngc, and a whole

lot ofbnrbcque sauce. You can cook it on the

Moving on.

Numberone: AstM Cafe The holywrailof

bacon,l sincerely hope that you're citlrer ko-
Sher, vegetarian or brand-new to the area.
The A&_M cooks thick-cut bacon (I belrcvc
in crisp bacon, but their bacon is so perfect
that It's even good limp) and doesn't Charge

need to worry about ﬁnding a cal.The only

You can make bacon yourself, of course.
Giab a frying pan and a package or store-
bought hacon, separate rhe strips, and lay
them our in rhc pan. cook over rnediumrhrgh

remember that because it is deliciously fatty,
you probably shouldn't eat it every night. If
you start going into withdrawal, try turkcy
bacon. Despite being chrsh, I've always eaten
real bacon, but turkey bacon isn't bad ifyou’re
desperate, Kind oflike those rake-bacon dog-
gie treats.

If you've over-dosed on bacon and lost the
love, i recommend working your Way back
slowly. Crumbled bacon on your Dining Hall
cheesy tries. Bacon chocolate trcm Vosges,
Bacon Salt, available at borh l-lyvec and Furcr
