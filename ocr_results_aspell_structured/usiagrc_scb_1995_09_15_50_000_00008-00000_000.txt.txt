Grinnell community.

tothe Scarlet&Black’s article. wedo

eenwewillmakethetraditionalcon—
cession. Until then please do not
expect hand outs from our house.
Nor will we feed the animals.

2. contrary to last week’sarticle
there is no “open house or sorts" at
ourhouseon Friday night. The garli—
ering, better known as a slammin'
party, will be held on Saturday night
in honor of Eric's birthday. Please
come and enjoy, but do not come ro
our house Friday night looking for
handouts for your animals.

3. Be it declared that Ben Hodg—
don is a senior, not a junior as last

you to believe. He is technically an
animal, but you are encouraged to
give him handouts anyway.

considered a district, otherwise we
would be one. Any connection to
the famous “Red Light District," in
Paris is completely coincidental and
should not be spoken of in polite

6. Many people will right you
down when you seeJah light. Let me
tell you if you’re not wrong then
everything is all right. —B,M.

7. The aforementioned S&B
article makes it quite clear that our
house is “themeless,” and “doesn’t
have a theme," and correctly reports
that we are not ”trying to mold our
selves into a particular theme." The
theme of our house had never been
discussed, and ithasyet [0 be. In fact,
it may never be the topic of converr
sation at our house. We might be
persuaded todiscussa theme ifsailors
were handing us animals on Hallow»
een in Paris... ah to dream.

Alternative Happy Hour:

Last Friday night, Alternative
Happy Hour made its first trip to Des
Moines. Close to thirty Grinnell
students, old and new, traveled to
the basement of a church in a low—
income neighborhood to spend the
evening with a racially and ethnical—
lydiversegroupofelementaryschool
children, doing structured creative
and educational acriVities. This pro—
gram is a weekly tradition (dubbed
“Fun Night" by the children) started
several years ago. The basic goal of
Alternative Happy Hour is to pro—
mote intellectually stimulating and
emotionally nurturing relationships
between college students and chil—
dren from the inner city.

In the program’s efforts to en—
courage the children to value and
continuetheir education beyondhigh
school, the group has brought the
children to theGrinriellCollege came
pus on several occasions. The most
recent trip at the end of last semester
proved to be one of the most success—
ful ones. The children were especiale
ly interested in and receptive to the
glimpse they got of college life, and
by the end of the day, many of them
had decided that college was for them.
The group is making plans for the
children to return to campus next
spring.

One of the program‘s goals is to
convince the children that college is

__i an attainable goal for everyone. (Er

gardless of background. In the past.
the membership ofAlternatiye Hap
py Hour has been more reﬂective of
thediversityamongtheGrinnellstu—
dent body. Unfortunately, so far this
year members of the group have re
ported homogeneity may be a prob»
lem. For example, the group who
participated last Friday consisted al—
most entirely offeinales. The lack of
racial and sexual diVCrSily is ofpar—
tictilar concern because the children
may not identify college students in
general as coming from backgrounds
similar to theirs. The children may
end up learning from Grinnell stu—
dents that college is a wonderful and
fun place to be, but might believe
that it is not a place for people like
them.

To the Editor:

I’d like to offer some criticism of
your back—page calendar this semes—
ter. It is definitely more visually
appealing than last year’s 8&B cal-
endars, but by breaking events up
into categories it makes it difficult to
see what events are occuring at the
same time.

I think the loss of Harris party
advertisements on the calendar is a
very real loss. People (including
myself) invest a lot of time and effort
into planning a party, and advertise
ment in the loggtas is a hassle. not to
mention a waste of resources. Also,
recently someone has been remov«
ing signs from Quad foyer as quickly
as they can be put up. Since Harris
parties are all—campus events, they
deserve to be mentioned in the 8&5
calendar, and yet there’s no category
for them.

The“Weeklies"categoryimust
we tell you eyery week? You adver—
tised the UL) meeting last week, but
not this week. EAG told you about
its meeting time almost a week be—
fore the latest issue came out. and it
still didn’t get a spot on the calendar.

Many people say that art is one
thingand function is another; Idon’t
believe this has to be the case, but
that's irrelevant. It seems that the
current S&B calendar erts on the
side of art. A little more function
would be nice.

Scarlet & Black '

 

Certain members of the Grinnell campus community apparr
ently feel that the Scarlet 6t Black is a forum for their own
personal, private jokes. While it is true that the 8&B has fallen
Victim to these pranks in the past, I would like to emphasize that
we are making every attempt to run aserious newspaper. I do have
a sense of humor, but 1 would appreciate it ifsatire made at the
expense of the 8&8 were forwarded to Andy Kropa, the Gum
editor. Deliberately pulling the wool over the eyes of 8&13
reporters, while perhaps amusing. only wastes time and effort on
the part of students interested in producing a good newspaper.

Grinnell should revert
to old pass/ fail system

DAN BUETI‘NER
EDITORelN-CHiEF

Orinnell's current Satisfactory/
D/Fail system, which was approved
at a faculty meeting in December
1994 and went into effect this fall,
awards students an “S" for “A"
through “C” level work with no ef»
feet on their gradapolnteavemge
(GPA), while “D" and “F” grades are
figured into students'GPA’s, Under
the old Pass/Fail system, a “P" was
awarded for work completed at the
“A" through “D" level, without afe
fecting GFA'S, while “F" grades were
figured in as such. The new system
however, does not reflect the (lexi
hility ofthe old, and the deadline for
changingtoorfromFass/Failgrading
doesnotallowstudentsadequatetime
to make an informed decision about
their classes,

An arnele in the February 17
1995 Scarlet at Black quotes a facul»
tymemofromHelenScott,assocI:ite
dean of the college, which says that
the decision to change the old P/F
grading system was made because
many iaeulty members felt that "(he
P/F option [was] sometimes used by
studenrswho wish[ed] todothe min—
imum possible work for a course and
still ‘get by’ without GPA penalty."
The urtiele also states that "Several
faculty members have been dissatiSr
fied with a system awarding students
a ‘P’ for oleyel wot

Yet according to the current
Grinnell grading system as shown in
the 1995—96 Grinnell College Course
Catalog. page 46, a “D" grade is a
“passing" grade. Grinnell’s policy on
academic [HZUOY requirements is that
a course completed with a “D” can»
not be counted; neither can a course
taken P/F or S/D/F. Since neither 8/
D/F or P/F grades may be counted
toward a major, the faculty and ad—
tninistratron need not worry about
students ‘getting by’ with a degree
from Grinnell.

The original intent of the P/F
system was to encourage students to
branch outinto unfamiliardisciplines
without being too concerned about
their final grade, and P/F accom-
plished that remarkably well. For
someone taking two or three demandr

ing upper—lunel courses, taking an
introductory course P/F was a viable
option. In theory. it allowed stu—
dents to concentrate on the work for
tlioseclasseswhich were vital totheir
maiors, but still broaden their hori—
tons in another discipline.

A good measure ofthat flexibil—
rty has been removed from the sys»
temwith thechange toS/D/F. \X/liile
it is true that a few studentsoccasion-
ally took advantage of rbe system,
doing a bare minimum or work .n
order to ‘get by,’ it was unfair to
scrioussiildentstochangetliesystem
because of those few, The new sys—
teln simply does not offer as ‘safe’ an
option for the students who are truly
interested in btrinchingotlt, but who
are alsoenneerned nbourrreadingon
unfamiliar ground.

The current system also does
not allow students an adequate
atnount of time to assess their perfor«
inance in theirclasses. According to
the 1995—96 Grinnell College Stur
dent Handbook, the deadline for stur
dents to change a course to or from 3/
WP grading is today, September 15.
a mere three and oneehalfweeks into
class. Many students still have not
had any graded work returned to
them. or even received any assign»
inents more insdepth than readings
this early in the semester. it is unre—
alisric to expect students to make a
decision about S/D/F without any
graded material to base it on. The
deadline should be moved back sev—
eral weeks on the calendar, to, say,
the week preceding fall break, to give
students the opportunity to more
accurately assess both the demands
of the course and their performance
in it.

Grinnell'sadministrationshould
considerreverting to theold P/F grad—
ing system because it offers students
who are legitimately interested in
branching out the ability to take a
chance, Without risking academic
disaster. The administration should
also consider, independently of the
other change, moving the deadline
back because 1[\Vill givestudents the
ability to make well-informed choic»
es.

The editorial board Voted 5.1 in
rayor arr/us positron.
