OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES AGAIN

In connection with the impending
elections to the Student Council, the

Scarlet and Black wishes to again

consider the question or outside ac»
tivities and their place in the college.

This is a subject that is arousing

much discussion in the various cdue
cational institutions thmout the Colin»
try, and is one which must be settled
by the individual student as well as
by the individuﬂ college.

In many schools, a point system, or
limited ‘actl‘vity plan, is followed. By
this method, the student may par-tier
plate in only one major activity at a.
time. This Includes athletics, jour~
nallsm, debating, glee club, dummies,
and all the other numerous phases of
niﬁinal‘y college lite. such a system
undoubtedly has its ‘ndvantnges and
limits the activities in such a manner
that a large number of students are
given an opportunity to participate in
outside work

Here at Grinnell there are no re-
strictions placed on the number of or-
ganizations to which a student may
belong save those imposed by the
ability and the common sense of the
person himself. There are always.
among all classes, a iew who stand
out as leading personalities and the
tendency is to select these few out-
standing individuals for all manner or
duties. Under such a. system, it fre-
quentw happens that a. few reap all
the honors While others equally ca-
pable go thru schoor without receiv»
ing any responsibility other than that
imposed by the regular scholastic
work. The big how in unrestricted
participation in outside activities,
aside from (113 unequal distribution
or responsibility, is the slow neaden»
ing of interest in the remainder 01 the

classwhu are not actively engaged in '

directing the destinies of the class or
organization, and the consequent dlss
ruption ot the body and the gradual

‘ ‘ loss ol uniticd action

Both the limited and the unrestricb
all methods of participation in outside
activities have their drawbacks, and
the remedies for these conditions are
open to discussion. It seems fairly
obvious, however, that the number or
outside activities in which one Del" n
may participate should be limited in
swine manner, either by the authorb
tics or by the student, or electoral.
body itseli. The latter method is the
logical one here and everyone should
be given a, chance to prove himself
in worh outside oi the class room. In
the coming elections to the newly 01'—
ganized Student Council, and in other
elections to iollow, care should be
taken to select those who are not al—
ready overloaded and who can give
considerable time to the work. This
will give many whose abilities are as
yet undiscovered an opportunity to
prove themselves, and Wlll at the
same time make provision fora more
oar-eiul and more eriective manage-
ment oi the various student organizae

MEMORIAL DAY
As we approach the close or the
mouth, the question oi’ the observance
oi Memorial -DJ)«' once more comes up
[or consideration. This day, now more

significant than ever before, is one,

or the most noteworthy ot‘ any nation—
al holiday during the year, and all
Alnellcil. will join in paying homage
to the American dead of the last three
wars. This is n dl‘ty which is especml-
ly set aside as inVlolate to the memo-
l'y of those who have gone before, and
should be recognized as such by all.
what, then, shall we do in commem-
oration of this day?

Last year.
as usual, with the exception that all

especially interested in the town ser-

vices were granted from
classes in order that they might at-
tend, There was a good deal of uppb»

sition to this, but the step was made

excuses

necessary by the lack 0! l‘esponsibili»

ty assumed by the student body for
the carrying out of any especial order
or program. As on Founder's Day.
previous experiments had proven that
the voluntary attendance at special
services was usually below that or or—
dinal‘y 'days. Such an attitude of care»
lessness and irresponsibility on the
part of the student body he
changed before it will be possible to
have a truly adequate and titting
special service, such as should be pro
vided next Monday.

Gl'lnnell has an excellent war rec-
ord and Memorial Day should mean
much to thé students ot the College,
While the day should be marked by
snecial services appropriate to the
occasion. This must be accomplished,

must

of course, thru the cooperation and
the support or the student body How
it shall be done is a question for the
administration to decide. but whatever
the method adopted, the regular order
or business should be set aside, for
this one day, and all should unite in
a great memorial service
