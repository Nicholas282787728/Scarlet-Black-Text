A moving castle crashes—what in tarnation?

This weekend, a bare-bones documentary, a searing portrait of racial relations and a fantastical tale of love and
magic from a living legend walk into a bar and duke it out over which goes on which screen: see results below

Erma/mi is a unique autobiograph—
ical documentary, originally produced
for only $218. Jonathan Caouerte, now
in his 30s, was given a video camera
when he was eleven years old and pros
ceeded to record his life in a multitude
orways.

Yamaha]; is the product of that of
fortian autobiography in old home
movies, answering machine rapes, let-
ters and tclegtnms, photographs, clip»
pings, new video footage, recent inter-
views and printed titles that summarize
and explain Caouetre's lite,

The premise sounds selrrohsessod.
but it is far from it. It is an exploration
of Caouette's troubled adolescence and
his struggle to get out of it alive.

He was abandoned by his father,
abused in foster homes, raised by a
schizophrenic mother, had bad experir
ences with drugs and attempted suicide.
Much of the film is about his painful
relationship with his mother, and the
ways in which Caoutre deals with that
pain.

in producing the ﬁlm, caouette
utilizes all the amenities of Movie,
presenting a mesmerizing conction of
overlapping wipes, split screens, mult'r
ple panes, graphics and complex mon—
tagesThe production of the film itself
reﬂects the madness and desperation of
its story.

Tm'naliim is undoubtedly raw and
difﬁcult, but it is ultimately hopeful.
and tells Caoquerte's story better than
any actor or writer ever could.

The [flu/{1r mill: in Howl's Moving Castle, Tlvrfilm i: (1 Mary qf/om andmagi‘; by

Me n‘mlar ofSpiritcd Away,

Howl ’s Movmg Castle (PG)

Japanese master animator Hayao Miyazaki’s latest
ﬁlm, Hamil Mining Carl/e, takes a fantasy novel by
Englishwoman Diana Wynne Jones and adds his own
unique signature (along with a stark anthwar mes
sage) toJones’ story of love and magic.

Eighteenryear old Sophie Hatter (Emily More
timer) finds herself cursed by the evil Witch of the
Waste into a 90year old body (voiced by jean Sim—
mons).

She ﬂees her family and town, only to be picked
up by the Wizard Howl's (Christian Bale) titular casr
llc, a wonderful contraption suggesting a collection of
faces that trundles along on spindly legs. The castle
features a magic door that can open to practically

any location in the world, depending on how a dial
is turnedThete's also an enormous collection ofcobr
webs and dust that proves to be Sophie's ﬁrst obstacle
as she searches for the cute for her curse.

Howl’s castle serves as a visual metaphor for the
wizards cowardice, constantly moving around to
avoid problems. The castle is powered by Calcifer
(Billy Crystal), a tire dernon who will be either hilarir
ous or annoying, depending on how one feels about
Billy Crystal.

As Sophie and Howl gradually grow to love each
other, Miyazaki treats us to spectacular visuals of
ﬂight and war, and beautiful images of ﬂowered ﬁelds
and an Industrial Age town.

Haw/3' Moving Carl/e isn’t Miyazaki’s best work,
but it still showcases a fantastic animator with a crer
ative imagination.

Grill/I is one of the few movies with
the audacity to tell the whole truth,
however painful and uncomfortable it
may be. It addresses race relations in
Los Angeles, making it clear that eye
eryonc is racist and everyone is steretr
typed.

The movie opens with a car crash,
the culmination of interconnecting
plot lines that we learn about latcr. All
of the characters in the movie—black,
white, Hispanic, Persian—are victims
and perpetrators oftaclsmr

Brcndan Fraser and Sandra Bullock
ate a powerful Los Angeles white cous
ple. Don Cheadle is a detective whose
race plays a major role in his job. As
two black friends, Ludacris and Larenz
Tate steal the meme: Luda'cris spends
his screen time ranting against other
ethnic groups’ racism, Tate acting as his
foil.

At times, the script is pretentious
and ragged, and some may find diteCr
tors Paul Haggis world ofcoincedences
unbelievable, Many of these characters
magically encounter each other during
the movie in the hope that the lessons
on racism will stay in our minds,

In the end, the movie's message
feels tired and overdone. So that's it?
That’s the message Haggis wants us to
get> We’re all racist, so let's not be, OK?
As thoughtful as this movie thinks it is,
when it comes down to it, it has noth-
ing more to say than the low budget
ﬁlm reels everyone saw in elementary
school.
