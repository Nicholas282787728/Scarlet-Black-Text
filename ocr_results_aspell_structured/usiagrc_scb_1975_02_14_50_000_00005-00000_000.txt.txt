That blows against the empire

by Jeffrev Miller
Today is Valentine's Day. Hooray. One

ofmy all time favorite holidays. Actually,
my jaundiced attitude toward St. Valenr
line's Day is not due to any genetic

problems, but rather because when it'

comes to getting Valentine's Day treats, I
have the drawing power of a baseball
game featuring the San Diego Padres and
the Hoboken Zephyrs. Besides, why waste
time on a second-rate holiday such as
Valentine's Day when in the same week we
have a REAL holiday to celebrate? That’s
rightethis past Tuesday was Shrove
Tuesday—and you probably missed it.
didn't you? That’s why it‘s such a good
holiday—no Shrove Tuesday cards, no
boxes of stale Whitman’s candy, no special
Shrove Tuesday underwear for that
hometown honey of yoursijust a plain
simple holiday. But since there’s nothing
to say about Shrove Tuesday and since I
have no intention of discussing a trite
holiday like Valentine's Day, we shall (as
promised) continue with the Guide to
Overcome Academic Troubles (GOATra
guide devised with you, the student, in
mind.

Everyone in his-her academic life has
come across the problem of having not
done the assigned work and then being
called on in class. It is a most interesting
situation—at this moment, the teacher,
who may have at one time been a close
friend of the student, becomes Znorb from
Galaxy X4266, a creature that the student
dreamed about at the age of eight after
watching “The Outer Limits” and eating
Welsh rarebit. The student feels him-
herself in much the same predicament
that Grant Williams was in in the movie
“The Incredible Shrinking Man", com-
pounded With a sudden desire to lie down
and govto sleep in the LaBrea tar pits. We
of the staff of GOAT have been working,
researching night and day to come up with
a method to alleviate the anxiety and
possible congenital birth defects caused by
this situation. However, we have failed in
our dutyethere simply is no way out if
you’re stuck here. Ah—but don’t be
disillusionediwe have discovered a few
things that one should absolutely never say
when caught in this predicamentmthings
which at the very least, will allow you to
”celebrate a D or an F” (or a no credit in

our archaic, pessimistic system) and
which at the most will enable your
academic career to continue at Sal’s
Barber School in downtown Paducah,
Kentucky. So when the following dialogue
ansiies:

FRQF: Mr. Casady, would you care to
discuss the role of bagel manufacturing in
the economy of Upper Volta?
STUDENT: ereuhheablee . . .

PROF: Mr. Casady, did you do the work

for today?

never but never use the following lines:
“Blow it out your shorts, Buster."

“No, I couldn‘t—my hooks came into
contact with someone who has the plague
and they’ve been quarantined for a
mont

‘No-I have this radio showwhich takes up
an awful lotofmy time . . .”

“No—we were having a party to hang you in
effigy.”

“What's it to ya?"

“No—l was out looking for the comet
Kohoutek."

“No—don't you remember? I was getting
drunk with you at the Pu .”

“No~l died last night and all you're seeing
is my unascended Soul."

“No.1 was busy showing your daughter
(or son) some of my etchings."

“N071 didn’t have time—l’ve been busy
writing 3 humor column for the S&B.”

Now that you know what not to say, you

should next find out where not to go.
Everybody has had the experience of
going to a supposedly good lecture only to
end up sitting in an uncomfortable chair

acquired a list of lectures that you, the
student, should definitely miss it you get

by Kathy Kramer
The word “sexist”—not found in Web
ster’s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary

.(1969)7is composed of “sex” (either of

two divisions of organisms distinguished
respectively as male or female, or a
sexually motivated phenomenon or
behavior) and ”~ist" (one that performs an
action, or one that adheres to Or advocates
a doctrine or system or code of behavior).
It is understood that “sexist” is usually
applied to an individual who insists upon
emphasizing the social and physical dif.
ferences between the sexes. The second
definition of sex—as a phenomenonwan
easily be integrated into the word “sexist"
.as one who practices the physical action of
_ sex thereby imposing roles and shallow
definitions uponboth individuals involved,

The word sexist, since it has not been
defined officially,may embody both uses
of the word sex. The second definition,
without the negative connotations of the
first definition, can be applied to one
aspect of the Women’s Movement.

At the beginning of the most recent
Women’s Movement, Germaine Greer
proposed that each woman design her own
mode of revolt. For some individuals, this

.meant bra-burning which symbolized the

removal of die sexual constraints which
were placed on females. Termed the
Sexual Revolution or Free Love by
Newsweek and Time, women were sup-
posed to partake in the pleasures of the
body without being termed whores or loose
women. Commercialism sold the idea of
the swinging single as depicted in
Cosmopolitan or Playboy.

While the older generation watched in
dismay. men and women discovered single

0 pickup bars and casual communion.

A new social pressure, as basically
restrictive and harmful as Victorian
morals, came into focus. .

My first week at Grinnell exposed me to '

a sexist viewpoint that I regarded as
liberated at the time. The woman who had
engaged in the most affairs became the
hippest woman in our crowd because she
was supposedly sexually together and
liberated. Later I realized that her affairs
were simply “sexist" happenings where
two individuals used one another‘s bodies.

l cannot condemn her because she was
truly motivated to express herself
sexually, I do condemn the pressure that is
exerted upon an individual to adopt
anuther's modes of revolt and expression
(such as free love) as the only way of
feminist or human survival.

A liberation movement is one of free
choice, to the point of anarchy, not a
replacement of one type of morals [or
another

At the second annual Conference on
Sexuality sponsored by New York now,
women and men spoke out on their choice
of monogamy, in and out of the institution
of marriage, Perhaps the backlash against
repressed sexuality is dissipating and
individuals will realize that their own
preference on sexual attitudes is the only
one that will truly liberate them.

Our discussion of academic problems
you can overcome has almost reached its
end: however, one topic has yet to be
broachedithat of the Obnoxious
Classmate. Obnoxious Classmates are
those people who in class, delight in
explicating every aspect of the Hurfian
Experience from beginning to end for
fortyrfive of the fifty minutes of the period.
Out ofclass, they are typified by a) a large
collection of whips and exotic oils, b) a
fondness for lima beans braised in tur-
pentine, and c) the ability to play chess
solitaire, their ‘opponent' being either
Aristotle, Hume, or Spinoza, whom they
always defeat. In short, they are not what
one might call savory characters,
However, you can now combat the misery
caused by this lowly example of
humankind with the use of some of the
following techniques.

Scarlet and Black. February 14, 1975—11. 5

The first technique is called the Drift-
woodrcavett approach (so Called because
Dick Cavett used it with success on
Salvador Dali one night). When that Oh
noxious Classmate starts to talk about why
there was no Kleenex during the
Renaissance and it looks like he may never
end, simply turn to face him, put your
thumbs in your ears, waggle your fingers,
and say “Boogie, boogie, boogie!” (Say it
quickly and in a low voice for the full ef-
fect,) Dali Walked off Cavett's show when
this happened to him, and with luck the
same thing will happen with your
classmate. lf this fails, however, and this
person is a male, try this foolproof
technique: find an organic chemistry
book, position yourself near the Obnoxious
Classmate, and then simply drop it on his
testicles. Make sure you apologize ai-
terwards. Aside from being a certain way
to get this person to shut up, it will also aid
him in his report on the Vienna Boys’
Choir in the Eighteenth Century.

of course, there are other things you can
do to quiet these people down. Another fun
thing to do is to capture several killer bees
(they’re coming, you know) and then train
them to attack when a person uses a
certain phrase. These phrases are helpful
starting points: “I understand Godmlet
me explain Him ” “Joyce’s symbolism is
fairly obvious7 think I can explain.”
”Oh, what did Aristotle know?" When the
obnoxious Classmate uses these or similar
phrases, justlet those killer bees out to do
your work for you. There are, of course,
specialized tactics-chemistry students
can accidentally pour sulfuric acid in an
Obnoxious Classmate’s face; theater
students can helplessly watch an entire set
fall on an O.C. And then there are the old
tried and true methOdSAiCe down the
back, chemical Mace, setting fire to
clothes. pouring molasses in hair, etc. And
if you want to go the practical jokeA
embarrassment route, whoopee cushions,
onion (or pepper) gum, hand buzzers, and
fake boutonnieres are always good.

Well, this just about wraps up the first
Guide to Overcome Academic Troubles
(GOAT). Now, if you’ll excuse me, lhave
to go attend a lecture concerning Great
AmericanMobile Homes. Now, where did I
put those Grape-Nuts . . . ahmmy organic

Artiness rampant

by Richard Cleaver

Selfconsciousness is the order of the dav
in the latest exhibition in the Scheaffel'
Gallery of the Fine Arts building. The
show features works by two members of
Grinnell's art faculty, Martin Van and
Merle Zirkle, and will continue until
February 21.

The most obtrusive pieces in the
exhibition are the paintings by Van, which
are all in acrylics. with the exception of the
mixedmedia Salt Water, Most of these are
quite large canvases; Van seems to be
grappling with the problems of the vast
expanses of space. The space, sad to say,
is the victor. The viewer is confronted
a series of works divided into two areas of
solid color, overlaid with smaller planes
and figures, many of them pictorial in a
surrealistic manner. The resulting effect
is fussy in the extreme, When his
superimposed forms consist of writhing
worms and severed fingers, the im-
pression is downright nauseating. This
may be intentional (I suspect it is);
nevertheless, the composition suffers as
much as the viewer.

The painter’s chief concern appears to
be the use of the opacity of acrylic paint to
superimpose and juxtapose colors. Some
interesung combinations result, but on the
whole the results are unfortunate. And
even the smaller works suffer from busy
composition.

Merle Zirkle's stoneware is a trifle
better. Once again, however, the artist’s
consciousness of her Art lntrudes. Fur
thermore, in a medium such as this, where
a deliverate decision limits the forms to
functional vessels, this quality is even
more offensive, A vase, for instance, is
useless if it overshadows the objects lt
contains. In this respect, Zirkle’s enor-
mous, h'ghly decorated pieces are very

. puma. This, seems .to. handheld. '
temporary ceramicsmne’ which,

reprehensible. Another fashion Zirkle
follows, although less pernicious, is still
annoying. This is the craze for making
pieces with deliberate minor
irregularities, no doubt to achieve a
handmade or earthy effect which, when it
becomes universal, is a mite pretentious.

The use of glazes is the chief virtue of the
stoneware exhibited here The finest is the
rust color matte glaze used for the large
weed vase. There is a certain appeal to
white, granular surface of the tall vase in
the same case. It is a pity that the potter
does not trust the glazes to enhance the ,
beauty of the vessels unaided.

it is regrettably possible that the
depressing quality of the more con»
spicuous works in the showing may deter
people from examining the jewelry. These
items, also by Zirkle, are mostly pendants,
and are exquisitely crafted. Attention to
detail (even the clasps are carefully
designed) is evident. Although an artful
asymmetry is too frequent, the design
incorporates the possibilities inherent in
me diiterences of texture between cast and
flat forms and polished and oxidized
surfaces. Contrasting materials such as
gold and rosewood, and in one outstanding
case, preﬂolumbian beads, are also used
to good effect.

Here again Zirkle’s lack of consideration
for the intended purpose of each piece ui-
warts iull success, While some of these
works are attractive in display cases, they
do not look as if they would survive the
move to a person’s bosom. For one thing,
they are too large: for another, the
number of appendages to each might
prove impractical,

The overall impression left by an
examination of the showing is of a
collection of experiments. This might be
instructive; however, such a collection
might better include either fewer works or
more'artists:.Certainly‘this’co’llection-' ‘ '
