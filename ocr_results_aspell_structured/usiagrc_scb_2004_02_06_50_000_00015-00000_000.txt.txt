in y J o e G e n i

The sun was setting or. Darby Gym oi.
Saturday evening as the Gtinnell women's
basketball team took a razor-thin 57—34
halftime lead over ViSlllng Carroll into the
locker room.

“There wasn’t anything spteiht said,"
said guard Emily Kolbe ‘07. “I think our
team lost realized what
we had to come out and
do to win this game.
They were right behind
us in the conference
standings, We just i-eal.
ized what we had to do
and earns out and got
it done,"

Gtinnell opened
the second halfon a we
5 run and never
stopped running in an szeoo vietory. it was
the centrzl game—in terms ofboth ehtoe
nology and impomnco—of a threegame
home standvagainxt Beloit, Carroll and
Monmouth, and thanks to their wins, the
Pioneers, who seorehed the neo ofDarby
by scoring 83, 82 and 76 points over those
teams, have now won six straight and ll of
daeir last 13. Given the quality ofopposi.
tion in their next two, though. they need
all the momentum they can get.

“Well, in out first game we play st.
Norbert who is third in conference." said
forward Katy Bowen ‘05. “I thinlt we have
a shot at both ofthese teams. But Ripon is
at the top ofthe conference. It’ll be hard [0
play both of them at their plaee, but we
really don’t have anything to lose going up
their and playing those two games. We’ll
try to win one of them at least,”

st, Norbert is a game ahead ofGrinnell

“When we first played Ripon and st.
Noi-bertl thinlt our women were in an
evaluation mode," said
head eoath Andy
Hamilton “‘l‘heywere
testing the situation to
see ifwe eould be com-
petitive with those
teams, Now .ve are
eonhdenrantlwehnow
we ean play with any
team on the sehedule,
whieh is what we plan
io do this weekend,"

“I rhinlt thatwe definitely have momen.
tum going into these two games. that dcfir
nitely thinlt we're going to give st. Norbert
a run for their money," said Kolbe. “We
mntch up well against them. Ripon'savtry
rough ream, diey'ro undefeated in the con-
ferente, so we're gomg to go out and give it
our best shot."

crinnell will look inside against st.
Norbert, utilizing'th! hothanti oftopseorer
Tai Duncan '04, but me Pionee.s admit that
Ripon has few weaioiesses.

“I thinlt Ripon is strong pretty murh
everywhere," said Bowen. "st. Norbert is a
little wealtet inside, so I think that's where
we have a ehanee to win the game, ifTai
keeps dominating lilte she has been."

one thing that shouldn't ooneem the

“our road sueeess .s due to playing great
team basketball," said Hamilton. “aspen.
enee ts the main ingredient fot playing well
away from home, and out starting five is
very experienced even though there are only
two Seniors,”

This past weekend showed that the Pioa
neers aren't too bad at home. either. on Fri-
day, Grinnell beat Beloit 83-70, led by
Bowens 18 points and 15 eaeh from Lind-
say Peter ‘06 and Ann: veit ‘05. Dunan
had 14. The next day against Carroll, veits
rout ﬁrstrhalf Sepolntets kept Grinnell
ahead ofrlievisitors until Duntati took over
in the seeond half, ﬁnishing with 24 points.
Finally, on Tuesday night against a
Monmouth team they had beaten by a
smgle point earlier in the year, Bowen and
Dunem had 18 and 16 points respeetively

as Grinnell won woe to improve to [44
overall. 8-3 in eonterenee play

“outmg our tecent sueeess we’ve been
playing great team basketball,” said
Hamilton. ”What maltes this team speeial
is that anyone who is on the floor tan make
a posttive contribution, and anyone can
seore. When an opponent prepares for us
they eannot prepare to stop all five players,
so we ,ust have to be aware of the positive
matehups and utilize different individual
strengths."

“1 think we trust earh orhet a lot, and I
think its showing a lot lately,” said Bowen.
“We had 31 field goals and 20 assists in are
last game [against Carroll], and so we're
doingagood job distributing and everyones
getting shoe in and sooring points."

Conference is next weekend

Lined up sholildereioeshoulder. the Senior Grillncll swimmers and
divers streteheti from lane one to lane Six, Aeeotding to Hui ley, they were
large enough in numbers to eoinprise their own eonferenee team,

This senior recognition at last Saturday’s home meet marked the close
of the swimming and diving team's regular season. Both the men and
women capped off their last dtial meet with victories over Augusraita,
winning 153.72 and 178-59, rupzcrively. Forseveral swimmers and divers,
last Saturday's home meet was their final tompetition, and they ltept the
team motivated by swimming lifetime bests to end the team's regular scar
son on a positive note.

“it's a pretty good meet to getset before conferenee," said Mike Miller.
explaining how the team used the meet to line-lune their shills without
being overly concerned about their opponents.

on the men's side. Reid Wyatt ‘oo ended his season with an impress
sive 100 free, Also noteworthy was Kevin Wood ‘07s victory in the so
Free, in which he beat an Augustanzi swimmer who had defeated him in
the Same event earlier in the season. Wood and Peter leﬂl‘lSh ’06 ﬁnished
1-2 in the 500 free while Ntltc Kimball ’07 and Robbie Dcwhui'st '06
went L2 in the 200 ﬂy \vithxcnson bests. Braden l’cnce '05 won the 200
back, even though it \vu the first time be had swuln that event in scvcnl
years.

On the women’s sidc. Elin Crow '07 posted a season-best in [hc 100
free with a turnerﬁ'olh behintl win. lunn Holm ’04 won the 500 flee and
Amber chlinskc '04 won the 1000 free by eight seconds wltli a season
best. Also victorious was Rachel Sellon '04 in both the 200 IM and the
200 ﬂy. in the 200 breast, Lucy McCormick '06 and Natalie Funk ’07
went 1-2. On the boards, Melissa Buchanan ’07 had a season best in the
3m event.

In order to keep tlle swimmer: fictm becoming stale. most of the Pio-
neers entered events in whieh they might not swim at Conference, Howe

ever, Millct believes that this didn't lteep the team from looking ahead to
Conferenoe

“Kevin Wood doesn’t usually swim the so fiee, but by swimming well,
he set a positive ions by showing the rest ofrho Conference that we're a
strong team," he said.

The new cheats developed by the men's room during the meet will,
attording to Millet, boost morale going into Contersnee. Erik Larson '05
initiated the “bath 50" cheer for the men's team warmeup. in whieh every
male swimmer would bart- when he breathed to reiterate the team's nick»
name ofMad Dogs.

“ltwasvery intimidating" said Lauren Dickinson '06. “The guys were
elaiming their territory and asserting their authority."

in the upcoming week, Hutley will finalize the list of those tempering
for points at Conferenee. In the end, she will pick the swimmers who are
good enough to win points for crtnnell, regardless of their times.

To matte sure her athletes dons spend the week before Cottferente
worrying about then individual eompetition from othereontertneesehools,
Hurley won't tell her swimmets the events in whieh they will compete
unul the night before Confereuee.

Though the Confertnee enny forms are due on Friday, Hurley will
overecntcr her athletes in many events and then stratelt them tight before
the meet.

"its a blessing and it ourso," said Hurley oFtliis strategy, designed to
prevent tival sehools from lotowing which Grinntll swimmers theywill be
Competing against. "Ifyou sertw up, you penaiive your athletes," she added.

The tea... is talong a breals from competition this weekend as its mem.
bers taper tor the Conference meeL Aeeording to Daniel Shryock ’06, the
men's team has already started getting “strange looks on eampus“ beeause
they are all growing beards. He prediets that theyll be equally distinttive
on eampus right before Cotiieretioe, when they will shave .iot only their
{total hair but also then heads.
