The men’s and women's basket
ball reams kicked ofrtheir longest and
most important home stand otthe year
on a high note, Both squads picked
up convincing victories Tuesday night
in the new Darby Gymnasium over
Monmouth College against the first
of six straight conference foes that will
visit the new facility in the next thiee
weeks.

The wins lent some muchsnceded
enthusiasm to both teams,who had lost
a combined 17 straight prior to Tues-
day night,

“The team has been travcling for
what seems like forever," said Matt
Brown ‘05, ”so it feels good just to be

home, and to get a win when they have
been hard to come by makes it that
much more special.The win also gives
us some momentum and conﬁdence
going into a game where werwill be
representing Grinnell to the whole na-
tron. Confidence plays a major role in
how we are able to play."

Grinnell’s game against Beloit
last night was nationally televised on
ESPN2, making it the firsr regular scar
son Division III broadcast by the net»
work in over 20 years

“We're pumped and ready ro bring
it to them,” said Doug Ticus ‘07, heads
ing into rhe game. “The win over Mon-
month was big, and it certainly gives us
some more confidence. We know we’ll

over watching, and we just want to rep;

resent our sysrern, our seniors, and our
school as well as we can, We just can't
wait to get this thing going."

The men's 127-110 win over Mon—
mouth brought their record to 5-13
overlill and 279 in the Midwest Cons

In rhen last rune—up before hosring the confer—
ence Championships, the men's and women's swim
teams comfortably defeated the Augustana Vikings
on the road last Saturday.

The overwhelming depth of
the men's team, as well as strong
cfrorts by several fronreline swime
mers, led the Mad Dogsyto an
easy 202-82 victory over the host
Vikings. Senior captains Brett
McMillian, Darryl Neufcld and
Braden Pence posted ﬁve victories
to lead the Pioneers. Neufeld's time of5:07,08 in the
500 Freestyle ranks him fifth in the conference in that
event, Geno Peterson ‘05, three-time defending Miri-
west Conference champion in the 100 Backstroke,
won both backstroke events at Augustana.

“I thought the team swam well," said Pence, “those
small dual meets are hard to get up to before con-
ference, but I thought we got up and supported one
another."

The women’s team lost only one individual event
in a 216—78 rout ofrhe host Vikings. First-year phee
nom Amanda Kclcdjian lcd rhe way, winning the 400

Individual Medley (4:52.45) and the 200 Butterﬂy
(2:13.88). Keledjian recently broke Grinnell's pool re»
cord in rhe 200 Butterﬂy (2:10.76) and leads the cone
ference by six seconds in that event. Other multiple
winners for the Mad Ducks wcrc
Lauren Page ‘06 (200 Freestyle
and 500 Freestyle), Lucy McCore
mick ‘06 (100 Breaststroke, 200
Breaststroke) and Allie Kossoy‘OS
(100 Backstroke, 100 Freestyle).
“The team was in good sptirits
, and is excited to taper, and we’re
hopeful for conference," said
sprinter Erinn Croco ‘07,

The Pioneer diving team has consistently domi-
nated the competition so far this season. Junior Sarah
stayer, who rejoined the team in Florida after a see
mesrer abroad, has already posted several national B
cuts on both the one and three meter boards. Slayer,
recently named the Midwest Conference diver of the
week, broke Grinnell school and pool records on three
meter with a score 0(293.80.

Finally out of the shadow of four—time Midwest
Conference champion Eric Blevins ‘04, junior Daniel
Shyrock has shined this season, posting the confere

Both teams are in preparation for the Conference
Championships, to be hosted by Grinnell February
11-13, but are also hoping to send swimmers to the
Division 111 National Championships, held in March.
No Grinnell swimmer has participated since Rachel
Sellon ‘04 qualiﬁed in 2002.

“There’s talent on both the men’s and women’s
side to quality for nationals, but whether that hap-
pens or not is yet to be seen, lfcvcrything goes our
way, we'll have both men and women qualifying for
nationals," Felice said.

Winning the conference meet is, however, the priv
mary goal. “I expect the conference meet to go really
well. We have a strong, deep team and I think both
teams have a really good chance to win ifwc work
together and work hard and swim together. It's along
grueling weekend, but I think we can gcrirdone,"said
Croeo.

Pence is conﬁdent that the Pioneers will come out
on top. “I think the men and women are going to win
again, and i rhinkthat it's going ro be alot offun. on
the men's side, it’s going to be a pretty big elass leav-
mg, so rhat makes it a big meet. 1 think we're going to
win and have fun doing it.”
