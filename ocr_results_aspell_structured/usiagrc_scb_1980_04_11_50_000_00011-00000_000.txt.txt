A premature sojourn

I dread breaks. Ireally can't stand
them. They are a waste oi time,
money, and effort. You can bet that if
I were in charge or college ad-
ministration, I'd have a heart. I’d
make students plow through four con
secutive ninermonth periods of school,
slap them a diploma, then shove them
out; good-bye and good riddance. No
breaks, no Christmas, nothing.

Don't get me wrong. It's not the

“headsplitting, hookecramming, stiff-
knuckled, lightening speed typing, jog-
ging to the post office, prooireading
while running paper and takehome,
oops-live minutes to pack beiore the
bus leaves“ syndrome that’s got me
down. Hell, you can easily get used to
that by spring break oi your junior
year. Nor do I dislike my parents.

What I can’t stand are the cruel
shoves into the real world, to fight or
die, until you are let back into Grin-
nell again. Breaks are hostile. Even
me word sounds cruel. It reminds us
of broken homes, broken hearts,
broken trusts. and broken glass, And
I’m not the only one who thinks so.

This past break I talked to a student
who was frantic at the thought ol
another break from Grinnell. She
vowed she wouldn’t leave. She locked
herseli in her room and refused to
come out. I gained admittance
through the transom. I found her in a
total position, tightly packed into a
drab corner of her dorm room.

“Come on,” I pleaded. “Be brave.
We all hate breaks, but they are an lne
evitable part of college life, like ilu

types out there. (I gestured
dramatically to the street.) J.A.P.S,
aren't confined to the East Coast
anymore, you know. And anti»
lntellectualism runs rampant here on
our campus just as much as
anywhere.”

She gasped.

“Well, look at MOBE, or the college
Republicans" .and. .SGA. and, well
jocls, and...People will rip off your
laundry here faster than in any sleazy
laundromat in Cleveland. Property
damage isn’t confined to Harlem, And
with more students with T.V.’s we’re
not even sheltered from Chuck Barris
productions."

1 pleaded to her to get up and leave
but she just sat there, clutching her
typewriter cord and The Theatre and
Its Double. (You guessed it, she is a
theatre major.)

I finally scared her out by reminds

ing her that 8&6 people would be
coming in to clean and that they were

authorized to fine and arrest any
squatters caught in the dorm past 1:00
pm. on Sunday.

That did it. The poor girl leit on
what I told her would he a “wonderful
break.” Boy was I wrong. I'm really
sorry I advised her to go. I saw her
yesterday in a catatonic state.
Because she is a theatre major I
couldn’ i tell it this was her normal
condition or not. .but, her R. A er

Her story was complicated. but
briefly it goes like this:

shots at registration. Now pack your
things, get on a Greyhound
Americruiser, and go someplace.”

“I can’t," she whined. “I’m
scared."

Ididn't believe it, but I tried my best
to convince her that the real world
wasn’t so bad. I began by telling her
that, anyway, the differences be:
tween the “real world" and Grinnell
were very marginal.

“Why, your chances oi getting
assaulted, molested, or beat up here
are just as great as they are anywhere
in the real world. Take Des Moines or
New York for example.”

“Yeah, but the people...,"

That’s bad enough. But, to top that off,

she went to visit her grandma in
snialltown Iowa. That in itself wasn’t
bad but she had to watch TV. with
her grandma. Until looking at T.V.
through her grandma’s eyes, she
hadn't realized how morally
degenerate and degrading T.V. had
really become.

Seeing Chrissy bouncing around gig-
gling because Jack was in drag was
tormenting. Then she had to sit and
listen to Mr. and Mrs. United States
tell each other about their first sexual
experience, nine years of marriage
and two kids later. All her grandma
had to say was, “Watching T.V. Sure
helps me keep up with the times. I
know you’re living with your

boyfriend. Everybody does nowadays."

The student spent the second week »
in New York to punish herself further:

At this point, the RA. rubbed salt ' ’
into my wounds by explaining, “She »
followed your advice about jumping » '
into the real world, Carolyn. She was .
drowning but she stayed in the
water.‘

Because our little theatre major had
to study [or a test the first Monday
alter break the girl stopped by Grin- '
nell on her way to New York to pick-
up a book she had forgotten. She was ’
caught breaking into her dorm and , -
was hand Cuffed and lined $25.00.

The ﬁrst iew days in New York,
everything went smoothly. Then, her. ,
car was stolen. The car she could live~
without but in her car, also stolen,
were her sketch book, notes for her >
exam, her favorite J.A.P. Onassis - . '
sunglasses, and some jelly beans.

As fate would have it, she ended up .
riding back on the Greyhound. (At
least the decor was in “comforting,
earthrtoned colors” and the bathroom-
contained all the chemical conve- '
nience of home.) She survived on ven-.
ding machine Oreos at 3:00 em. with'
all the other ”bus-people" and kept »
her complexion free from diesel fumes
and smoke by regular swabbings with.
Ten 0 Six lotion.

She returned to Grinnell and had to
face all her friends with their blister- -
ing, peeling, dry,leathery but gorgeous
tanned skin. That s when she slipped
into her present state

Breaks are a cruel and unusual ’» '
form of punishment, but don’t think
I‘m scared of the real world. I’m ac-»'
tually looking torward to graduation
so i don't have to have any more
breaks. At least after graduation you
have time to adjust to the real world. ‘
We are adaptable creatures, alter all.
It‘s just the breaks, those cruel, brief‘
plunges into the abyss, those divisions
between madness and reality, ' -
(madness being our status at Grinnell,
of course) that get me down.
