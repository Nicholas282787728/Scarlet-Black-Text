Taft Lectures
on Roman All:

Shows Relation of Italian
and Greek Sculpture
In Early Times.

“Roman art gives us glimpses into
the lives, ideas and endeavors of'tlie
Italian people,” remarked Lorado
Taft in his lecture on “Gi'eek Art in
Rome and Early Italian Sculpture"
at Herrick chapel last Wednesday
evening, Tlii is the fourth oi a sore
ies of five lectures which Mr. Taft is
delivering. The last lecture will be
Wednesday evening, November 13, on
“A Visit to the Fifteenth century,"

"Roman art is very different than
Greek art," began Mr, Taft. “At
first the Italians didn’t have
slightest interest in art, They did
a man's work, They were a. busie
ness and political people. They had
conquered the world and were busy
administering to it.

”Presently, however, the Italians
became greatly interested in the en-
during art of Greek sculpture. By
overdoing the work they left behind
them great numbers of copies of the
types of Greek work which would
have otherwise disappeared."

Romans Use Terra Cottn.

These people who copied from the
Greek style did much in terra cotta,
said the speaker. They succeeded in
producing portrait busts which look»
ed more life like than anything that
the Greeks had cared to make. When
the Romans made their conquests in
the second century Bf C,, they took
home a great number of Greek mas-
terpieces from the-cities which they
had captured. “The glory of Greece
was added to the grandeur of
Romel" was the way Mr. Taft phras-
ed it.

The Italians filled their private
villas and palaces with pieces of
statuary. Temples and public baths
were heavily ornamented. The Ro-
man emperors were the most popu-
lar subject for the artists at this
time. Virgins, goddesses, victories
and religious themes were also rep-
resented. The Italians excelled in
historic reliefs.

“Art in Italy slept for one thouse
and years before the great awaken-
ing called the Renaissance,” con-
cluded Mr. Taft. “Then they began
to make great attempts which were
full of promise. Their greatest work
was produced in the cities of. Pisa

' and Florence."

ping, her markets are controlled by
foreigners, there are no hospitals to
mention, no public health work ex-
cept that done by the missionaries,"
concluded the speaker. “Industry,
transportation, mining have not been
revived because the Chinese haven’t
the necessary capital. The United
States has given both commercial
and industrial advice, but the real
problem is not technical education.
but the need for men of intelligence,
honesty, and good will to lead them.
These we are helping to produce by
our support of Grinnell n-China,"
so Years Ago.

The Junior class held a social gath—
ering at Westfield at which “Wiener-—
Wursts” were served.

A number of young ladies of the
cottage entertained a few gentlemen

Associations Aid Good Will.
“Your Christian associations stand
for these two things, thus training
the youth of America to be a strong
er band holding the nation together
than material ties more easily snapv

Heartily endorsing the Pioneer

clusion, “The associations are your
chance to register your conviction
that the world needs insight into life.
Your Pioneer chest may mean not
