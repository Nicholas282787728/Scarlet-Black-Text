Chapel Address by Mr. Markham.

Etlrvin Markham gave a veiy
interesting and instructive tall: to
the students in the chapel Sunday
alteinoen, lii chronological on
he IlEILI
I't‘iltl and the inﬂuence they have
litttl upon his lite. He spoke oi
the poetic passages of rare worth
in the ancient religious works.
such as the Vedas ol the Hindoos
and the Egypiian Boolt or the

tier he told of the books

Of the writers of the Middle
Ages he considersDante supreme
and spokc at some length of his
portrayals. Dante considers the
supreme evilof the world faith-
lessness or failure to meetone's
obligations.

Among the more modern auth»
ors, Goethe stands out pre-enii-
nent among the Germans and
Victor Hugo among the French.
Shelley is the greatest master of
rhythm the world has ever pror
ouccd but Blownillg surpasses him
with his keen insight into tile soul.
Emerson is without doubt the
greatest mind our country has pro
duceol, having much the same sen.
timent as Carlyle and Ruskin in
his early life. Lowellis ourtrusst
poet, although Longfellow and
Whittier are more popular. Maze
zini in his work, “The Duties of

 

Mail,” has shown hunselt to be
a [Illnlt'er of the highest order by
his cxriiesiion ot the social itleal.
