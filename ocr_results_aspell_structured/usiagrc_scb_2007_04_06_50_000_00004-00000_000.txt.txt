Grinnellian sews up a $10,000 grant for peace

Inspired by a semester spent sweating & studying at a Nicaraguan women 5 co- op, Jamie Zwiebel ’08 MM found her own

By CHRIS NEUBERT

When Jamie Zwiebel ’08 fell off the back
ofa motorcycle last semester in rural Nicara-
gua, she landed in the midst of the system of
inequality that she was trying to help change.
“The constant care I received was amazing,"
Zwiebel said. "All the nurses and doctors
treated me as a human, not as an American
or anything else But she recognized clear
discrepancies bcrwcca the care that was trail.

Pioneers

the people she was working With in
the town of San Ramon. “Sometimes
patients would have to pay for their
own bed sheets," Zwiebel rememe
bered, “and antibiotics were five times
as much in the clinic than in the sub-
sidized pharmacy where I worked," The
experience lett Zwiebel deeply touched.
“My host mother told me ‘as Nicarae
guans, we all struggle to survive.’ This
was somethingI realized while i was in the
hospital." This summer, when Zwiebcl re—
~ turns to San Ramon to continue her work to
help raise the local standard or living, she will
have a $10,000 birthday gift to assist her ef-
forts.

The gift is part or the celebration of
Kathryn Wasserman Davis‘ 100th birthday.
An international philanthropist, Davis de-
cided to celebrate her birthday this year by
donating 51 million to 100 studentecreated
“Projects for Peace.” Students at 76 colleges
across the US. were invited to apply {or one
of the 310,000 grants, with the only stipulae
tion that students focus on grassroots projects
that promote peace. Zwiebel, who ﬁrst heard
about the project while still in Nicaragua, will
direct her funds toward creating two women‘s
sewing cooperatives to serve rural areas near
San Ramon. The realization ofwhat an ime
pact $10,000 could have in a developing nae
rion inspired her to apply. “It’s amazing how
{at the dollar will go,” she said.

The rural area around San Ramon is a
place with 80 percent unemployment. Only

20 percent orthe children go to school regularly
and many suffer from malnourishment. Povere
ty is prevalent throughout Nicaragua, and San
Ramon is no exception, “People live in houses
made of stone, wood, sticks, grass or thatch,"
Zwiebel said, "I actually lived in a house made
ofconcretely blocks with a dirt ﬂoor." Women
of San Ramon are in an especially tough situ-
ation. ”Macliismo is prevalent and men fre»
quently” migrate to find agricultural work for
large landowners in order to survive,"
“Unfortunately, many
abandon their wives and children."
Most of the women Zwiebel will work
with arc young tccn mothers left in
charge of large families. “1 was struck
by the leadership ability of the young
women I worked with,” said Zweibel,
adding that despite their desperate circume
stances and heavy burdens, the women she
met "make the most out of scant resources."
It is the leadership, tenacity and ability of
these young women to quickly acquire new
skills that Zwiebel is hoping to engage in 0,.
der to move her project forward. The ultimate
goal, (or Zwiebel is to provide “sustainable em—
ployment" for the women in these rural areas,
to help them avoid joining the ﬂow or rural
families to urban slums.

Initially, Zwiebel said, she did not have a
particular project in mind. For guidance, she
contacted her former supervisor in Nicaragua,
Rosario Gonzalez, over Winter Break. Zwiebr
el ﬁrst met Gonzalez when she interned at the
Centre Promocional Cristiano, an organization
where Zwiebel helped establish a clinic stocked
with natural and indigenous medicines.

“She was one of the ﬁrst malnourished
children to receive care at the center, and now
she’s the director,” Zwiebel said. “I am con-
stantly impressed by the contagious inspiration
or these women who are helping and training
each other."

Zwiebel first submitted her Project for

This June she will ﬂy back to Nicaragua

workshops will begin to and women with the
basic skills and abilities needed to participate
in the cooperative. Eventually, 40 women will
be chosen (0 be a part of the cooperative, and
according to Zwiebel, the employment of these
40 women will indirectly beneﬁt 250 people in
the San Ramon area. “One man I worked with
told me ‘wirh just a little hclp we could lift

trying to do with this project.” Zwiebel has
already planned how the bulk of her 310,000
grant Will be spent. Most of the money will
fund the basic materials for the co-op, like
sewing machines and fabrics. And, most in
portantly, sewing instructors, since Zwiebel
said with a laugh, “I can’t even sew!"

While Zwiebel is the first to admit that
there are signiﬁcant challenges to overcome
to improve the quality of life in this area or
Nicaragua. Projects like the sewing coopera-
tive are an important part of empowering the
local population, and, as Zwiebcl emphasized,
“being seen as a valued member of the come
munity... can transform lives."
