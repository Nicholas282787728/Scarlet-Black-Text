Watching “Funny Face" and
listening to Neil Young are, at
first thought, abstractly dissim-
ilar. However, if you let your
mind swim in the pool of ma-
nipulative rationalization, it is
easy to see the profound sim-
ilarities, While Neil Young is
great at composing songs, the
form in which he delivers his mu»
sic often leaves the listener sayv
ing, “That‘s a really good song,
it‘s just too bad that Neil rue
ins it with the screeching, high-
pitched spew he calls singing,"
Similarly, “Funny Face,” 5 musi-
cal satirizing tlle fashion world,
is based on a periectly plauv
sible story line, but through
misguided casting ﬁnds itself
bogged down with unbelievable
characters and situations.

Apparently, the audience is
expected to accept a 58ayear-old

Arts

Funny Face

Fred Astaire with the some en-
thusiasm as the moviegoers who
were dazzled by the magic of his
partnership with Ginger Rogers
years earlier. Of course, As
teire‘s aging bones still can man-
age to glide across the dance
ﬂoor with relative ease, but it
seems that one’s appreciation
only stems from the name of
the irran who is dancing, not
from tlle dancing itselfl In ad-
dition, Audrey Hepburn is cast
as a “plain Jane" without the
slightest care of the fashion she
wears, And iryou believe that, I
have this bridge in Brooklyn you
might be interested in.

To further this analogy be
tween rock ‘n’ roll star Neil
Young and the musical ﬁlm

“runny Face,” it might serve
well to suggest the dated quar

ities shared by both. From
Young's political songs like
“Ohio" ill the early 705 to his ex~
periineritation with synthesizer
rock in the 805, we gain a
sense that his music is some
what dated, as it lends itself to
a certain time frame. similarly,
“Funny Face” is distinctly 50s
in genre, which might cause it
to lose a degree or its humor
for the audience's younger mem—
bers. This ﬁlm is being shown
during the heart of the Parents
Weekend festivities, so don’t dca
spair: someone is bound to en-
joy it.

Perhaps it would be best to
heed the timeless advice of Phil
Lesh: “Believe it if you need it,
if you don’t just pass it on."

Salt of the Earth

“Salt of the Earth“ portrays
the true events ofa bitter strike
of Chicanos in the zinc mines of
New Mexico. When an injunc-
tion is issued against the worle
ers, the wives talce up the bat-
tle with a fury, leaving the hus-
bands to care for home and chila
dren. The script by Academy
Award winner Michael Wilson
warmly depicts the situation‘s
humor as well as its drama.
Shot on location in 1953 by
blacklisted ﬁlmmakers, “Salt of
the Earth" was completed in
the face of vigilante attacks,
its star‘s deportation to Mexico,

and a concerted denial or tech-
nical facilities. Boycotted by ale
most every theater in America,
the lilm won major awards in
Europe and is now recognized
as a classic, even in the U.s.,
where it was widely shown in
16mm during the turbulent 605
and 705. “Salt of the Earth”
is the second work in the noun
Programs Women’s Filln 5e-
ries sponsored by the son Film
Committee.

*ttirtrt The Night of********
the Shooting Stars

by Jessica Mezzacnppn **********k*****‘k*******

First of all, never be afraid of
something just because you’ve
never heard of it.

“The Night or the shooting
Stars," directed by Paolo and
Vittorio Taviani, is about a
small ltalian village near the
end of World War lI. Once an
idyllic community, the town di-
vides into two {actions at the
threat of invasion. Onc hall

fearfully awaits its rare in the
church, while the other hall
bravely plans escape. The out-
come is both insane comedy and
one of the saddest stories on
ﬁlm The cinematography is
beautiful. See this one.

Gates of Heaven

by Alessandra Bocco

“Gates of Heaven" (1973, 35
minutes), E-Morris’ ﬁrst ﬁlm,
is a documentary, yet it is
not; it is about pet ceinelcrr
ies, yet it is not. “Gates of
Heaven" documents the decline
ofonc pct cemetery and the suc»
cess of another, and the lives
of the cemeteries‘ owners and
clients. Morris' detached style
exposes these ordinary Arnerir
rails ror wimr they are-hilarious,

pathetic, tasteless— without the
typical manipulation or perspec-
tive found in many dornrnen
taries. “Gates orllenven" is oulv
rageously funny, and even a liir
tie depressing, too.
