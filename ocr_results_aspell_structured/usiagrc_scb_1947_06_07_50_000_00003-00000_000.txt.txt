Ivy Decries
Nazi Medicine

"Super-race" Science
Leaked Moral Principle

“Nazi physicians manifest-
ed the same defects as the
Nazi philosophy, and that is
‘wlly those physicians are
now Serving as prisoners in
the dark", “as the conviction
expressed by Dr. Andrew (3-,!
Ivy, di tillguished Professor
of physiology of the Univer-i
Sity of llliltois,. zit an all»
college convocation held BTOUv
day, May 26, in Darby gym.

Dr. Ivy, who was awarded the
honorary degree of Doctor of
Science by President Samuel N.
Stcvcns, Spoke on the Nurem.
burg medical trials. Hc rccentlyl
returned to this country fram
Germany, where he acted as a
medical consultant to the allied,
prosecuting attornies,

Discussing the historical hurl i
ethical aspects of the trials,l
Dr. I\y ﬁrst listed some evi-
deuce ot the {act that Nut SS
doctors aotril uithoirt ethical
precept. Many ot tllrir deeds i
were, prompted, .he said. by the
desire to make medical (“score
eries "merely tor the suite of
t . ovary."

He cited the case or Dr. Sig»
iuuud Rascher in using human
beings in aviation experiments
for the Lurtwaire; and the case
or Dr. Gebnart in the use of hum-
an beings to settle h medical
disagreement with Reinhard Hey--
drrch, ”The butcher of Lidlce.”
At Buchenwald arid Dachau, he;
went on, investigators \llicovercdi
records of “research” experiments
which contained “faked, dishonest,,
and unreliable evidence."

“In this country, by ample
experiments on i olunteers, much
good was done, but nothing at
signiﬁcance has come train
, ieuce under the Nazi regime."
Thus, he concluded, "The
once and technical skill of me
ciiic could not sunill: without
some basic moral philosophy"
This philosophy is found by‘
hon - medical men iii the oath
of Hippocrates.

Dr. Ivy's speech was preceded,
on the. convocation program by a
formal academic processio , an;
introduction ot the speaker byi
Professor Grant 0. Gale, head of
the department of physics; and
two Negro spirituals, “Sct Down
Selvant" and “Soon-ah Will Be
Done," sung by the Grinnell col—
lcgc choir, under the direction or
Mr. David Secular. ‘
