G.W.S.S.
converted
to major

BY CHASE FELKER

What was previously Grinnell college's
most popular concentration, Gender and
Women's Studies,will now be a major entitled
Gelrdcr, Women’s and Sexuality Studies.

The cwss majorwill focus on the history
and development of theorists and researchers
in both feminist and queer thoughr, in addition
to the proglession of the ﬁeld ot’woinen’s stud-
ics.The majorwlll also plaee a heavy emphasis
on intersectional analyses, such as how race,
class, gender, nationality and age inlerrclatc.

“I'm really thrilled that we have this," said
Kathleen Sken-ctt, Associate Dean oftlle Cole
lege and Chair of the GWSS major. “The BX’
pansion of the faculty to include [GWSS face
ulty] exempliﬁes What we were looking for in
the Expanding Knowledge Initiative."

The Expanding Knowledge initiative, a
result of the college’s Strategic Plan, is respon-
sible for increasing interdiseiphnary eourse ot-
ferings, increasing faculty size and organizing
the secondryear retreat for students.

“We now have the faculty, the major [and]
the students to create a GWS program that
will thrive," Skerrctt said,

Like the Biological Chemistry and most
independent majois, GWSS will be interrdis-
ciplinary. Students who major in GWSS will
enroll in eourses from multiple departmenrs,
and even multiple divisions. -

“It’s kind of the classic Liberal arts major
because it forces the student to understand
what different kinds ofscholats do in different
disciplines and at the same time build a coher—
ant body of knowledge around Gws sehol-
arship," Astrid Henry, Associate Professor of
Gender &Women’s Studies, said.

Henry hopes promotion of GWS to its
own department will allow for applications of
gender studies underrepresented at the college,
such as the natural sciences. “It would be great
to have more classes looking at the way gen-
der and sexuality shape scientiﬁc questions,"
Henry said.

Henry also noted the possible expansion of
masculinity studies, LGBTQstudies, internar
tional and transnational feminist studies.

“There's a lot of conception that it’s not an
important thing to have, but it really becomes
more important everyday," zoe sehein ‘12 said.
“ “I'm glad that Grinnell is acknowledging
that it's a legitimate focus for an academic ca-

stronger preparation for graduate study than
the Gws eoneentration. Though gender and
sexuality studies is still a relatively new acar
demie diseipline. “It's a good time to get into
it,"Erica Hougland '10 said. “...Therc‘s still so
much room for new scholars to inﬂuence the
entire field."
