'lIl-l WHY 01“ A COLLEGE
"The primary function of the col-

lege,“ decwl'es Dr. Edwin A. Alder-’

man, president or the University oi
Virginia, in the current number or
World’s Work, “is to receive youth in
an aunusphere ol‘bi'oad and varied as»
sociatlan, in Contact with wise and
noble lives, and to offer them such
experience in evolving manhood and
capacity, and such knowledge or man,‘
nature and spirit that they shall gain
power to enter into lite with chamCA
’ter, intelligence and enthusiasm."
Considering this statement from an
undergraduate point of view, the
training for leadership, which is to
be the ultimate result at long school-
ing, is prepared ior, but not provided.
in the (our years in college.’ The
scholastic work which the individual
carries, with varying degrees or enthu<
siasm, is designed for one purpose: to
[in a bmkzmnnd on which later
knowledge may be posed That work

which he elects is considered to be!
matrnctive, while the nnpopulur Wr— :

trons oi required work are held as so
much dead weight which must be ear~
rlcd but not ntlllzed. The nttitude or

the student, turnout, is governed by‘

individual pieterences and fluctuates
with the degree or enthusiasm shown
by each one \ .

Under such conditions, it is obvi—
ous that everything which savers.oi

,iidiustmeut between the various mem—
‘bers or the college. The thoroughness
of the work and the value of it rests
on the individual and on the indivi-
‘dual alone. The whole question ric-
tSOlVBS itself, then, into one Of inleh

Edual responsibility and it given an 017—

t
.:llortuitity the students will vindicate

all the faith that is placed in them.
The true function or a college is to

provide a means for individual derol—1
l

enment and expression. To suppress

this and to turn out machine made pros,

ducts and not individuals is to sup-
press the whole idea of the worth
while college. li Grinncll students
cannot make the most of their oppor-
tunities Without forced attendance at
classesl‘then it: is utterly impossible
(or them to maintain a worthy Stand-
‘srd or work under another type or
‘system. i
'i‘iili INTER-D0111! GAMES

I This siwiuoon, the hrs: games in a
series or intersdormitory basketball
contests are scheduled to he played.
lThis is a revival of intramural sports
to! last year und'ouce more promises
to be an imporan iactor in the de-
v'eiopment ot a uniﬁed spirit in the
dormitories.

From the standpoint or skin, the
series promises to be more or less or
d tut-co and it is n me prediction that
the unsophisticsted might well think
thct it new variety of iootball has been
introduced. However, from the stand-
point of actual beneﬁts, the fellow-

cy gives rise to varying results in the
colleges nnd universities of the coun-
try, and in Gi-lnuell the tear that the
stress on campus activities was be-
coming too great has occasioned the

present absence rule. This ruling,

Ind the attitude that‘accompanies it}

brings up the question, "Why is a col

The value of four years in college
particularly in A school, Such as Grin-
nell, lies not alone in What you gel'
from the Classroom, or from text-
books, but also in what you get train:
the professing individually, and from
contact with other students Who are

thinking and doing the same things:

Lhﬁt you are thinking and doing. The
bridge of the scholastic nrdel‘, a‘diplo—
ma, is a very oramental bit of work
but as a certiﬁcate of practical knowl‘
edge it means nothing. .

E—vei-yoite realizes that a certain mini
mum oi sntisiactory classroom work
is, necessary to get the tundamental
principles or knowledge but without
additional experience this is useless.
A certain amount oi discipline and a
number of rules are
achieve the best results and yet the
whole worth of the institution rests

not on its legislation or rules or dis-‘
cipline, but on the relations of the {etc-i

Illty and the Students. If a. school is
to be a success, it must be sufficiently
broad in its relations with the indie
vidual to foster the best that is in him

and not to stiﬂe him under a. lo‘bd ot‘

useless red tape, the product nf'a sys-
tem that ls.too antiquated to gaze be-
yond yesterday and that is too nar-
row to see above the page of the test.
The success of any institution rests
with the student body and the morale
oi: the school is determined, not by

legislation, not by theory, but by the
t

necessary tut ‘

some time. The results of last‘yesr's
intro-mural contests were very satis—
factory and this year the work should
'not be limited to the basketball series
but should be carried out in other

What Do You Think?

Edltor Scarlet and _:Black

The Writer (eels that if Grinnell is
l to continue to hold its place and rank
among other colleges, something must
this done to revive the 01d 'Grinnell
Spllit.” ,Many new students have
come here with a great deal of env
thuslnsm having heard so’ much of the
“Grinncll Spirit." But so many have
remarked, “I don t see anything of the
Grinnell Spirit. Where is i ." can
this situation be a result hi ‘the gen-
eral letting down at moral standards
that Seems to he sweeping the bonus
try, and is threatening the very insti-
‘tuzions that are really worth while?

s students, aren’t we too Cl‘ltlclltl of
one another? Aren't we prone to

‘ think that our own opinion is the only '

correct one, and no one else has a.
right to a different one? Don't wé 0(-
ten give in, or compromise when “t:
know we shouldn'tl To us the Grin-
nell Spirit is that something within
us that can surmount all difficulties,

and bring us out victorious even in‘

the lace oi great odds. why can't
the-Grinnell students take it upon
themselves, individually, to promote
this better, cleaner, and more whole
some spirit, and make Grinnell a col—
lege that lives up to its ideals? We
‘believe in Grinnell students. We be-
lieve they can revive the old Grinnell

'____.___—
By WILLIAM HARD

Washington, D. C., Juan> 13.-The
most notable circumstances about the
Washington conference this week has
been the transfer or interest hwzty
[ruin the Washington conference to
the conference at Cannes. Tho sue
preme council or the prime ministers oi
the Allies has been working out a
plan for safeguarding France against
renewal or German aggression while
at the some time insuring to eel-m-
any and to all central Europe an 011‘
portunity tor ﬁnancial and general

 

ed work on the naval limitation treaty.

mittee investigating the matter de- .

economic recovery.

At Washington, negotiations contin—

ued between the Chinese and Japanese
regarding the terms on which the few
sul'vi\ing remnants oi Japanese in-
duencc in Shantung could be exﬁngu-
ished. The Chinese have triumphed
distinctly over’ the Japanese in the
Slialitung affair, without ever spends
ing the life oi one Chinese soldier on
it. They little by little, ilom 1915 to
date, hate built up such a piopagon»
dist backﬁre throughout the world
againstJapanesc possession and Ju-
pnnusc use of the rights iormcrly lie—
lnuging to Gcrmauy in Shantung that
now we see the Japanese hopig that
they will he at least able to retain
the ruilway in Shantung. The mere
ﬁnancial supervisory rights which
British iot-eigners exercise ovci- sev-
eral railways in other partsiof China.
The Chinese victory in Shantung is
really virtually complete.
Besides Shautung, one other subject
has engaged the attention of the
Washington conference. The naval
and other experts have been droning
the detuils of the hive Power treaty
limiting the naval urmam nts or the
United states, Japan, France and ltaly.
it is reared that certain of these
details cannot be satisimoxily set
down until in France there is a min-
istry iormod to succeed the ministry
of brisnd and to issue detailed instruc-
tlozu to the French delegation in
Washington m disputed and unsettled
points 11 Briand should succeed
himself. and should himseli become
the seat or a new solidiﬁed ministry.
the instructions from Paris to the
French delegation might be resumed
promptly, but they also might contain
certain changes in matters regarded
as already ﬁxed. The accord between
Briand and Lloyd George tor or her-
mony between French and hritish in—
.terests in Europe might’ lead France
to make concessions in the matter or
submarines shd to accept a lower
limit on French submarine power than
has hitherto been thought possible.

French policy regarding submarines
is based really on the possibility or a
break between France and Britain. it
that possibility is succeeded by the
certainity or a sort or entente, then the
French might be able to think or
abating their submarine prospective
and potential power. Thus by a grab
irony, a, stroke o2 old fashioned dis
plclnacy, a defensive entente between
France and Britain, may promote the
new fashioned limiting of armament
at Washington. Cannes: besides be-
ing a rival to Washington, may in fact
be an assistant to it.
