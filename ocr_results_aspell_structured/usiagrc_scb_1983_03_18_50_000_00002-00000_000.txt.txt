Ethics— the
responsibility
of a newspaper

Many people see the Scarlet and Black as nothing more than a
glorified Memo, still others view it as an instrument available to all
students with something to publish, and then there are those who claim
that the Scarlet and Black is nothing more than a small clique of would-
be journalists taking themselves too seriously. Very few people, on the
other hand, choose to see the Scarlet and Black‘s true purpose: to be a
newspaper. As a newspaper, the Scarlet and Black is bound to uphold a
code of ethics which serves as the foundation of all newspapers from the
New York Times to the Grinnell Herald-Register.

Unlike a newspaper, the Campus Memo is little more than a publishs
ed bulletin board, Though the Memo may be a primary source of inforr
mation for many, unlike the Scarlet and Black it is not strictly bound by
a code of journalistic ethics.

While the Scarlet and Black accepts submissions, it is required by the
Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics “to seek news that
serves the public interest.” In this respect, we are required to print, to
the best of our ability, only those articles which will be of general value
and interest to all students,

Implicit in this assertion is the fair and equal coverage of campus
issues and events. The Scarlet and Black cannot, for example, print a
front page story on one “pet" topic if this causes the paper to ignore
some other pressing issues, Thus, the members of the campus com—
munity should not view the Scarlet and Black as a means of publishing
whatever ﬂiey want to have printed.

Yes, we are a small community, and many students may be ac—
quainted with members of the Scarlet and Black staff. However, these
associations become irrelevant when staff members are operating in
their professional capacity — as responsible journalists who must abide
by certain ethics. For “journalists who use their professional status as
representatives of the public for selfish or unworthy motives violate a
high trust,”

A commonly-heard complaint is that “ the Scarlet and Black takes
itself too seriously.” As a newspaper, the Scarlet and Black cannot af-
ford not to take itself seriously. True, the public’s view of President
Reagan or our national defense policies are little affected by What ap—
pears on our pages. Yet, it is not fair to assume that the Scarlet and
Black does not have the power to influence campus opinion. By acting
responsibly, or, if you will, by “taking itself seriously," the Scarlet and
Black ought to protect all members of the campus community from
slander, invasion of privacy, or unwarranted ridicule, The Scarlet and
Black does, however, retain the right to present opposing points of view
on any given isssue as long as it uses quotations in context and allows
all parties a chance to reply. Thus, what may appear to be an “unfair"
article which is intentionally injurious to a specific individual or group
could simply be an accurate documentation of a “heated" disagree-
ment.

Perhaps some students will find this discussion of ethics ridiculous
given the intimacy of the campus community and the relative impor-
tance of the Scarlet and Black with respect to other newspapers.
However, to refuse this code of ethics is to refuse journalistic respon—
sibility. And, as this campus‘s sole disseminator of news, the Scarlet
and Black can hardly afford to act irresponsibly. Thus, the Scarlet and
Black is neiher a glorified Memo nor “taking itself too seriously” the
Scarlet and Black is a newspaper.

Central American .

Conference will bring

issues home ’

by Jen Borg

With President Reagan’s recent pro-
posal to increase military aid to El
Salvador touching off a fresh national
debate about the role of the United States
in Central America, the upcoming conr
ierence on“Revolution, Reform, and
Reaction in Central America" promises to
be an extremely timely and informative
event for the campus community and local
residean alike.

The conference, scheduled for April 4-7,
will bring to Grinnell two individuals ac-
tively involved in public policy, a high-
ranklng official from the Nicaraguan em-
bassy lo the Unuted States and a
respresentative from the State Depart
ment. In addition, five diverse speakers
from academic institutions will appear
with the idea of presenting a balanced arr
ray of perspectives on the troubled region.

Conference coordinators Theda Herz,
assistant professor of Spanish and 1-1.
Wayne Moyer, associate professor of
political science, are enthusiastic about
the program. Herz expects me conference
“to provide a forum for the discussion of
major contributing factors to current con~
ditions in the region and to set the stage for
informed discussion of foreign and public
policy issues and of human rights.”

She also hopes to see “an exchange bet»
ween the campus and the local community
around the panel discussions.”

Since most speakers will be around for
the entire fourrday period, Moyer hopes to
generate a meaningful dialogue among the
participants of théconference at the three
schedule panel discussions.

Herz and Mayer are still not sure who
the Nicaraguan embassy Will send to open
the conference on Monday night at 8 pm.
in Herrick Chapel, since the ambassador
who had agreed to come has recently
resigned. Herz, however, expecs the Am»
bassador designated to take his place.

Perhaps in order to counter the perspec—
tive of the revolutionary Sandinista
government of Nicaragua will be Melvin
Blake of the Bureau of Inter-American Af»
fairs, who will offer the Reagan ad-
ministration’s views of U.S.-Central

 

American relations on Thursday at 4:15
pm. in South Lounge.

Among the remaining speakers there
will be noted authoritries on Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
Panama. Each will focus on one particular
country and its relationship to the entire
region. “From the conference we should
be get a sence of what historical,
economic, and social factors are operating
in each country, how the countries intern
relates, and what the appropriate role of
the Unites Slams should be in the region,"
commented Moyer.

The conference has been in progress
Since last splng, when the success of the
conference on Mediterranean
democracies suggested a similar topic of
turmoil in Central American. A great pros
posal was submitted to and subsequently
accepted by the Iowa Humanities Board.

“Have you ever felt like a mushroom?”

To the Editor:

Have you ever felt like a mushroom
(kept in the dark and fed shit)? After our
experience wiui the Hon. Senator Jepsen
and our other Washington repraentatives,
we do. We are writing to explain the feel-
ings of the citizens for lowa who par-
ticipated in the Citizen's Lobby for a
Nuclear Freeze in Washington D.C. on
March 7 and 8,

The Citizen‘s Lobby was organized by
the National Freeze Campaign to persuade
senators and repsresentatives from every
state to pass the freeze resolutions in-
troduced by Representatives Conte and
Markey and Senators Kennedy and Hat-
field. These nonbinding resolutions Call
for the United States and ﬁle Soviet Union
to immediately pursue a mutual,
verifiable freeze on the testing, production
and deployment of nuclear weapons. Last
year the same resolution lost in the House
by two votes. This year, the prospects look
better, and all six Iowa representatives
have cosponsored uie resolution.

Unfortunately, politicians like to pretend
their constituents are mushrooms...
Cooper Evans, for example, not only sup-
ported Lhe freeze resolution (HJ. Resolu-
tion 2), but he also supported the “anti-
freeze” resolution proposed by the ”peace
through strength” group. The antifreeze
resolution advocates a massive miliatry
buildup followed by a freeze and is strong
ly supported by the President. By avoiding
any controversial stand, Cooper Evans
managed, or so he thought, to grow a
healthy crop of mushroom constituents.
When the delegation from his district ask-
ed Mr. Evans to clarify his position, Mr.

Evans pleaded ignorance of the issue.
Senator Grassley was hardly more
enlightening. Six members of the Iowa
delegation (totaling 150) were allowed Mr,
Grassley’s nourishment. Because of the
Senator’s recent unveiling of Mr. F. Spin—
ney’s controversial Pentagon report on the
outrage of military spending (Time,
March 1), the delegation felt hopeful, As it
turned out, Mr. Grassley, like Represen-
tative Evans, had an inferior knowledge of
the freeze resolution, understanding it to
be a call for unilateral disarmament. (Are
our politicians mushrooms too?) an aide,
while a slightly less potent grade of fer-
tilizer (or maybe higher grade, but celain-
ly lower paid), managed to avoid any
policy statement for over half an hour.
But if Grassley and Evans grow
mushrooms, Jepsen grows mushroom
clouds. What happened in room 2359A of
the Rayburn House on March 8 in
Washington D.C. was accurately recorded
by the Des Moines Register. Jepsen pro-
mised a half hour meeting, only showed up
for three minutes to speak, then fled the
room avoiding any questions. It is a
disgrace to the American democratic
system that a senator has only three
minutes to spend with 150 constituents
representating at least 15,000 others by
proxy. Where is democracy when the
voting public will not be heard by the
elected? We all have a right to feel outragr
ed by the degradation of our system,
regardless of our position on the arms
race. It is time for us mushrooms to say,
”STOP THE SHIT.” Gail Fisher and Hugh
Deaner _ . _ _ ',
