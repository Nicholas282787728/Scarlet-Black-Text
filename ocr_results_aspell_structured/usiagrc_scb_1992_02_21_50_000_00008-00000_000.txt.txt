"Big band leader
of the 90's" Visits

Jazz trumpeter Maynard
Ferguson is a true livinng legend.
With over 60 albums recorded, he
has won almost every jazz honor
aand award thereis. The alumni list
of his band members over the years
reads like a who's who of the jazz
world.

Likemostgreatartistsinanyﬁeld,
his career transcends beyoond the
jazzworld. TwoofhisthreeGrammy
nominaations are actually for Best
Pop/Rock instrumental, one of those
being his "Gonna Fly Now" theme
from Rocky, garnering him a gold
album as it climbed to number one
on thejazz charts and pop charts as
well.

Though gaining him incredible
commercial success, these excur-
sions in pop, rock, fusion, and his
elecuonic group "High Voltage"

could not satisfy his artistic roots.
Ferguson enters the 90's with his
new "Big Bop Nouvea Band," once
again atop the Billboard jazz chart
marking his return to the Be-Bop
oriented acoustic jazz big band sound
that first established him as a jazz
force in the 50's with his legendary
Message From Newport and
Birdland Dream Band albums.

With his Live From London al-
bum slated for a 1991 release, his
Big Bop Nouveau band will tour the
world year round, living up to its
reputation as "the premier big band
on the road today!"

Ferguson set the jazz world on its
earin thc50‘s, and he enters this new
decade as THE big band leader of
the 90‘s. He will be performing at
8:00 pm. in Herrick Chapel. Tick-
ets will be available at the Forum.

Duck Soup

Duck Soup is arguably the best of the Marx brothers‘ zany comedy ﬂicks. It debucd in 1933 as a commercial
flop. but its before-iLSvtime political satire is not lost on a modern audience with 20/20 hindsight. The basic
plot is about theappointment ofan incompetentdictator who wages waronhis neighbors. Mussolini, thinking
this was a farce based on his own government, banned the movie. Not to be missed in Duck Soup is Chico
and Harpo Marx's famed mirror scene, perhaps tnorc well known to the younger TV generation through the
“I Love Lucy" parody. Duck Soup will be shown Saturday night at 9:00 in North Lounge.

-Susan McBumcy
Henry and June

film is a gorgeous, sensual depiction ofthe bohemian Paris of the 30’s. Show times are Friday and Sunday

Mighty,mighty ska band

performing at Harris

By John Siqveland

m
leg and a funny beard and is going to
see the Mighty Mighty Bosstoncs on
Friday, In the old days they weren’t
mighty or mighty, they were scrapers
andbeggars and wore plaid. In theold
days they werean averageBoston ska
(ska in the sense of the Specials and
the English Beat) outfit. In the old
days people wouldn'thavccompared
them to the Red Hot people and they
never would have opened up for
Fishbone.

Oh, theold days. Dicky wasapoor
boy in the old days. Dicky was a poor
boy, but he didn’t have a bad leg and

I have no clue about his facial hair.
Dicky is crazy and he sings for those
Bosstones who are oh—so-mighty
mighty now. He might be the reason
you want tojoin Captain Ahab at the
party Friday.

The Eosstones became mighty
and mighty on the night that they
decided to put a sort of thrash metal
on top of their ska inﬂuence. Horns
and Gangrene, AHA! I think that
they’re the only band in history to do
that and it leads to some of the most
fucked up changes and unpredictable
music around. Those of you who
aren’t Captain Ahab never fear, and
please don’t stop reading. Unpredict»
able is different, and yes, it may be a

littletoomuch forsome,butt.heystilk
do one hell ofa cover of“Allentown"P
and you might have seen them on the
Converse commercials on MTV over
break. (

Fuck it. Justgo. Please, I beg you,
just go, Throw on the leather boots‘
and flannel from your old days, the‘
jacket that says “Expoltted” on the
back, the first tie dye ya ever made,x
the ﬁrst Deep Purple album you lisr
tencd to, your first french kiss, and
sneak out the basement window with
ma's cigarettes and a Perrier bottle
full of orange juice and vodka and
lurkon over to seethe Bosstones. Say
hi to Ahab when you’re there cuz I
don’tknow if he‘sgoing to be able tot
dance.

Alumna speaks on museum careers

By Brett Fechheimer

On Feb. l7,Mary Shepard,31977
Grinnell graduate and Roberts lec-
turer, spoke to an audience in South
Lounge on the topic “Museum Ca-
reers: Museum Futures.“ Shepard
works in the education department of
the Cloisters, a “living museum” in
New York City that is a replica of a
medieval monestary and a branch of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Shepard, who grew up in Wiscon—
sin, explained that she has always had
an afﬁnity for museums. She believes
that museums should net be intimi-
dating and exclusive. Instead,shesaid

that the ideal museum should be a
“noisy place with lots ofdiscuSSton."
Shepard, a specialist in medieval art.
works as an interpreter of the Cloise
ters‘ artifacts, yet she feels that it is
essential for a musuem visitor “to
confront the original works on their
own terms before reading the inter-
pretations.” According to Shepard,
many musuem artifacts are
overinterprcted.

Shepard offered plenty of sound
advice to Grinnell students who are
interested in a museum career. Stu-
dcntsshould seekouthands-on expe-
rience working in a museum while
they arestill undergraduates, Shepard

said. and she is pleased to see that'
there has been “a lot more opportu-
nityforintemshipworkinthcpasttcn
years" titan there had been previously.

She also noted that a Master’s dcr
gree in art history is a “prerequisite.
foradvancemcntin museums." Aside ‘
from school and practical experience,
Shepard told the audience in South,
Lounge that “flexibility, an ability to
question, and tenacity—a desire to
see things through and to ﬁght for
them”werecssentialqualitiesofsuc-
cessful Candidates for museum ca-
reers. Shepard feels that her Grinnell
education enriched those qualities in
herself.
