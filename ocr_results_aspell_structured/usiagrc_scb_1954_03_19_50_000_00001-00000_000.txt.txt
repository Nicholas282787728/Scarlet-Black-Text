candidates on this ballot.

interest in the convention was
kept at a high point during most
of the proceedings by a series of
speeches which began shortly
after the convention was called
to order. The delegate or the
Water Closet association, Van
Crawford, notified the conven-
tion of this association’s seces-
sion from Rawson hall. He re—
quested to be seated as a sep-‘
arate delegation, and over the
objections of the Rawson dele»
gation spokesman Nate Johnson,
was accepted as an independent
delegation.

One of the ﬁrst candidates
to be nominated was Pershing
Gonselaw (foods). In a nomin-
ation speech complete with a'
special version of‘“The Boar’s
Head" Dewey Johnson dis-
closed that his candidate stood ,
on a platform of starvation,
indigestion, and constipation.

Later Fred Thompson, in his
speech seconding A] Harrison,
solemnly warned the conven—
tion of the sinfulness of all the
candidates but the one he sup-
ported. liberally using passages
from the Bible to prove his as-
sex-thins.

In one at the final speeches
on the nominating roll call,
Dick “Tiger" Hansen, borne into
Darby on the shoulders of his
admirers, assured the delegates
under the alias oi “Colonel
Zinnzinndorf” that there was no
truth to the assertion that
"Tiger’s” candidacy was ser-

, ious.
