[he Other Side Supper Club

by Tom Spackmon

The other Side Supper Club opened
last school year, so a Iriend and I
decided that since we were just plain
bored with the Longhorn and couldn‘t
allord a steak at JD's, we’d see What
this iiew restaurant was like We had
heard the load and service were good,
and that it wasn't too terribly over
priced, Unfortunately, we were disap»
pointed on all counts.

When it first opened, the Other Side
had a dress code. It had been repealed
by the time we went, but we dressed
fairly well anyway, hoping that would
improve the service We went in, sat
down, and soon the waitress came to
take our drink order, I ordered a
scotch and soda alid my friend
ordered an alnarelto Collins, While we
waited [or our drinks we looked over
the menu and admired the decor. The
inside of the restaurant is nothing
very special. It‘s decorated very simr
ply and in relatively good taste

A trip to Gilmcm

by Andrew Seboliz

Gllman is a quaint hamlet some
twelve miles north of Grinnell on
Highway no On a balmy spring day it
makes tor a very pleasant bike Jaunt.
Take a friend and go tor lunch at the
DarrMac Tavern The Dar-Mac is

. owned by the Macargars, two very
hospitable iolks who serve up burgers
and homemade chill as well as daily
luncheon specials It's also a bar and

place. .

. Right next door to the DaiulVlac is a

I littlenook that specializes in burgers
and onion rings known simply as The
Cafe. The Cafe and the DarsMac are
the only two places in town to eat, and

, though they otter the same tare, it

One more address up thc block is
Bob's Place. Thi\ is a straight bar and
sells mostly beer The decor is a bit
dliierent for a rural bar Rustic Oil
paintings done by the owner's
daughter grace the walls. in the back‘
there‘s a snooker table and its seems
like some pretty serious gambling
could take place here on Friday night.

Gilmali also has an old-time general
store which is filled with an assort»

Then our drinks arrived. My friend's

taste bad, so we decided to leave well
enough alone.

We both ordered Steaks, mine was
medium rare and delicious, and my
friend's was medium well and
reportedly awiul it hadn't been cook
ed properly, and the result was a
dried out, tough, and overly chewy
piece oi meat. There was also a salad
bar included ill the price of the meal,
The salad was iairly good (it Certainly
beat [00d service) and included,
among other things, cheeses, potato
salad, fruit salad, and the standard ar-
ray ol lettuce and dressings

The waitress was among the worst

up the drink order, she wr» aliva s

We may have simply gone on a bad
night, or been lucky enough to get the
only bad waitress they ever had. I
think the problem is that the Other
side is a new restaurant and it can
takc a while to iintl good cooks and
waitresses. It was also quite a while
ago so they might have improvcd, but
in general, ier $5 more JD's is pro
bably a better bet

Rube’s of Montour

by CJ Miller end i H Strauss

Really hungry? Ready to splurge? heady to sink your
teeth into the biggest steak you've cvcr set eyes on?
Then Ruhe's, in lvlontour, awaits you Because the

management at Rube's realizes that you are your own
best judge when it comes to steak, they allow you to
pick and fix the steak of your choice.

The [list thing you notice at Rube's is the gigantic
charcoal grill surrounded by happy, friendly tthough
occasionally intoXicatedi people flipping slabs oi sirloin.
T-bone, and filet. Next, the eyes locus on a refrigerated
display case holding the biggest, reddest, jllicicst pieces
of Iowa corn-[ed beef you wouldn‘t dare ask for In
heaven tThe sirloin steaks had to weigh at least 20
ounces!) Then one notices a mound of baked potatoes,
unlimited loaves of french bread, and a plentiful Salad
bar with a variety ol dressings and potato flxln’s.

Everything comes in ”all you can eat" quantities, ex»
cept the steak (which we dare you to finish). The prix
[me is a more 5850.

The only problem With Rube’s is getting there, it's a
20-30 minute drive. Take highway 145 north to county
road E67 (just before Gilmanl. Go about a mile on E67
t0 the intersection on E67 and T32 into Montour Don't
worry about getting lost at this pointiall roads lead to
Rube's. (Warning. Rube's is not for the veggie or weak

at heart!

The Number

by Bob Dorseti and Joel Baird

The Number, Grinnell's only excuse
for a strip joint, should be experienced
by everyone at least onceiand no
more,

On a given weekend night you can
iind here a sniokcrl‘llled iamily den
iallen irom suburban purity and
crowded with the cornted gentry oi
Grinnell. l

Not everybody watches or cares
about the invariably sad stripper
managing to get her clothes oii
without any sense at rhythm or seduc-
tioniwhlch is probably just as well. At

least at The Number. the striptease
as a desperate ritual oi sexual irustra-
tion is barcd for what it is.

This seems to hold true tor women
as well as men Local women take the
stage and unexpressively take their
clolhes oli. Sometimes protessionals
ply their trade and it can be in-
teresting to watch them try to get a
rise out oi the customers,

Occasionally on weekends thcre is a
cover charge oi about a dollar, Drinks
are $1.30 and up Pitchers are 5.; 00
and you can hold a can at beer in your
hand tor a dollar «Gives you
something to do with your hands.)
