EnterprIsIng young men

Mercury rising into the 505 earlier this week brought someyoung entrev
preneurs curbside on well-traveled Broad Street in Grinnell, offering pink
lemonade for a quarter.Ryan Gilbert (withthe pitcher) and Henry Bateman
(leaning on the table), both 6, are not novices in business: Ryan had a
similar beverage operation last summer while Henry tried his luck in a
special niche market with a paper clip, tape and rock stand. At that time,
the market indicated an absence of demand for rocks. At the time oithis
photo, however, lemonade sales had hit the onevdollar mark afterjust 20
minutes of operation: Henry's brother, Thomas (left), who is almost 10,
working on his second glass, described himself as the firm’s "chief cus-

tamer.”

IDED approves $28M
Dieomatic expansion

A $28 million expansion of
Dieomatic manufacturing plants in
Victor and Montezuma was approved
last Thursday by the lowa Department
of Economic Development Board for
future tax beneﬁts from the New Jobs
and lncomc Program (NJlP),

1f Dieomatic puts the production at
the plants, new contracts from Ford/
Mazda would add l50, 000 square feet
of production space and at least 100
newjobs

Dicomatic‘s expansion would cres
ate 75 jobs at Victor Manufacturing at
a median wage of $1257 per hour.
Twenty-ﬁvejobs would be created at
Montezuma Manufacturing at a me-
than wage ofSlZJ l.-

Productionatthctwoplantsisclosely
related Dieomatic has been awarded
pans contracts for a new type ofFord/
Mazda spons utility vehicle that is not
currently on the market. The lowa
plants may supply the Kansas City
assembly plant of Ford Motor Com-
pany with the body frame, shocktow-
crs, support cross members and other
parts.

Dieomatic is a subsidiary of Magna
international of Canada. one of the
largest automotive pans suppliers in

the world. Thecompany has six opera-
tions in lowa crnploymg more than,
1,100 persons. in addition to Victor
andMonIezuma,Dieomatlchasmanu-
lecturing plants in Tracr, Bcllc Plainc
and Williamsburg. The company also
has trucking operations In
Williamsburg.

“Upgrading manufacturing plants
with the latest technology to add new
productsis a majorcapiial investment,"
said lDED Board member Harris
Honscy. “The New Jobs and Income
Program, with its Investment tax credit,
is making It more proﬁtable for cams
panics to invest In Iowa."

With approval for NJlP, companies
qualify for property tax exemptions to

as for state tax credits, sales tax re-
funds on construction services and in-
creased job training funds. ml? is
available to companies that create
liigherspaying jobs with beneﬁts and
make new plant investments at the
required level or above

In the past four years, nearly $2. 2
billion in new manufacturing in-
vcstmcnts has been made under the
program, creating 2,096 newjobs.

New severe-weather plan
will take effect this year

Just as planning is underway for a
Iomado spotters classhere, Poweshick
County has been informed that a new
severe-weather notiﬁcation effort will
result in the installation ofa new radio
tower sometime this year.

Accordingto DougShutts,coordinator
ofPoweshiek County Emergency Man
agement, work on improved notiﬁcation
isbelngundcnakenbythe Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMAt),
lowa Emergency Management and the
National Weather Service.

“The time line is for Poweshlek
County to have a tower in Montezuma
on an existing tower owned by MWR
Towers sometime in 1998," Shutts said
”The holdup seems to be the federal part
of this and the speciﬁcations for the
transmitters, Aﬁerthat isdone, ilwillbe
about 90m lZOdaysto stanthe project."

Shims said he has been told that
Poweshiek will be one of the ﬁrst
counties to have its transmitter in-
stalled.

“You will be able to purchase a
receiver from Radio Shack for about
$40 plus tax," he said. “Grinnell does
keep some of these on hand if you
would like to purchase one."

Shims said the current system in»
volves a comparatively antiquated use
ofieletypc.

“Let‘s say bad weather is moving
into southwest lowa, and the National
Weather Service issues a tornado watch
or a severe thunderstorm watch for a
big area of Iowa," Shims said “As it
getscloserto us.theyscndoutteletypes.
lfthey see a hook echo southwest of

Grinncll,aguyhaslositdownandiype
this in, send to the Iclctypc rccervcr,
and it’s thcn dumpcdto thc Powcshick
County Sheriff‘s _Ofﬁce or the Grins
ncll Police Department And there has
to be someone there to read it, evaluate
it and put it out.“

The new system won't rely on
lclctype. instead, someone at the Na-
tional Weather Service can activate
the Indoor warning system and warn
people with a direct voice message.

But the system will work only with
the special receivers

The \Veathcr Scrvicc, however, is
also in the process of expanding its
National Occanogiaphic and Atmo-
spheric Administration (NOAA)
weather radio system. According to
the Weather Service, that will mean
that many counties now on the pc-
riphery of radio reception will have
strong, consistent sIgnnls from the
weather radio broadcast.

Aslatcmdelomadodrlllisscheduled
forMarcl-I 24. Poweshick Courity Emer-
gency Management and the Weather
Service will hold atomado spotters class
intheﬁberopticsroonialGrinnellHigh
School on March ll, Shims said. The
class will begin at 7 pm.

“The pubtc is Invited, so, with only
30 seats available, it will be on a ﬁrst-
come, ﬁrst—served basis on seating,"
Shims said.

in the past, the Weather Service has

regarding how tornadoes form, he
added.

 

Corning pulls out
of race for governor

Lt. Gov. Joy Corning has dccldcd that this isn’t hcr year to stay in the race
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. It‘s too bad. Comlng had an
important message: that paying attention to children and their families will
go a long way toward maintaining the social fabric of Iowa and keeping the

state on a stable footing.

The trouble was that the message didn’t resonate with voters. Corning isn‘t
a tub-thumper, and she‘s anything but an ideologuc. No The former educator
and veteran public servant simply espouscs modcratc, coininonssensc
political Views without any bombast. She wasn’t a oncsissue candidate,
though — far from it. She would discuss lowa’s economy, education,
gambling, the death penalty and other topics in depth and with conviction

when she announced Monday
that she would end her candidacy,
she cited the fact that she got into
the race a bit late, and that worked
to her disadvantage. The other
three GOP candidates ~ former
Congressman hm Ross Lightroot.
lowa Secretary ofState Paul Fate

and cablc~TV executive and former gubernatorial aidc David Oman 7
already had been traveling the state, raising money and building their
organizations. Coming thanked her supporters as being “genuinely interested
In making a poSltive dirrcrencc in the lives ol'all Iowans." She added: ”i am
so glad to have addressed the Concept orpI-cvcnticn ofproblcms In such a

public forum" as a political campaign.

Maybe it'sJust as wcll shc’s bowed out, it's difﬁcult to Imagine a stream
of negative TV spots coming from a Corning campaign A or her being on

the receiving side ofany mudslinging.

Public opinion polls generally had Coming near the bottom when It came
to ranksznd-ﬁlc Republican support, so it‘s probably meaningless to debate
which of the other three candidates might beneﬁt from her withdrawal. if
these surveys are to be believed, Lightfoot already has such a wide lead that
another GOP casually could occur in [he ncni filllll'C, \Vlll Pale be the next to
drop out? Oman‘.7 Neither man will even acknowledge that possibility, of
course, not should he. But ot'lhc three who are still in the race. Oman
probably stands to pick up what little suppon Corning l‘llill. He's closest to
Coming's brand of calm, centrist politics.

We‘ll ﬁnd out in June, nfcoursc. Meanwhile, there are at least some
lowdhs who are sorry to see Coming end her campaign. she brought class

and common sense to thc cffon,
