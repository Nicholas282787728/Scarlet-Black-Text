Prep Gridders

Receive Praise

Mason City Papers Commend
Freshmen Highly

Mason City papers paid high this.
ute to the Grinnell freshman grid team
Friday in writing up the game with
,Mason City Junior college played the
preceding evening.

Al Mitchell, sports editor at the
Mason City GlobeeGazette, wrote,
"The Grinnell freshmen were the
toughest aggregation that the Trojans
have been called upon to face this
year, and it was a saving [actor for
Mason City that the Little Pioneers
were not more accustomed to working
as a team.”

With only one injury reported as
a result ot last Thursday's game,
John C. Tniesdale, lreshman coach
has been giving the prep squad Notre
Dame plays which are being used
against the varsity to accustom them
to that type of play. Eddie Hickey,
coach of the Creighton olitiit which
the Pioneers meet this weekend, is
a Notre Dame graduate and cmployes
that style of offense.

Keith De Lacey, lightweight center,
was the man injured in the opening
prep tussle. A recurrence of an old
high school injury to his hand and
slight. injury to his back will keep
him on the sidelines [or about it week
All other members of the yearling
squad came through in good shape,
Coach 'huesdale reports.

Watt to Experiment
With Grid Lineup

(Conti ed From Page 1),

since 1921 while the Grinnell lads have
taken but two, No deadlocks have
been recorded,

The Pioneers are fast gaining a vie.
toryless reputation. Last season they
dropped nine consecutive contests and
thus tar this season they have been
topped by five strong outtits. '

However, they have shown surpris.
ing power in all five contests. in their
great haltback, Wes Clark, they have
a man who is capable of breaking up
any man’s ball game, He is the man
the Jays will have to watch.

Coach Eddie Hiekey's Jays snapped
a losing streak with a 13 to 7 victory
over the powerful Oklahoma Aggies
last weekend and appear to be head—
ed for their tirst Missouri Valley con.
ierence tiLle. Both Grinnell and
Drake stand in the way and must be
downed.

Head ofNewtan Schools
Delivers Vesper Address

Schools exist tor two purposes,
stated Mr. B. c. Berg, superintendent
of Schools in Newton, in his address
at vespcrs Sunday after-no n. Eirst,
in order to find the possihil ies of an
individual, and secondly to help de—
vclop these possibilities in order that
their possessor may enjoy most of
life’s advantage. After a man has
been to school, according to Mr. Berg,
he should be more capable of living
it full and rich life.

This idea, held by American edu.
Ca‘ors, is opposed to the theories sup-
ported by European dictators like
Mussolini and Hitler; they maintain
that, Since schools are supported by
the state, the students should he
‘ ught to exist for the betterment
ot‘ the stoic, My Borg pointed out, The

Baker CL) _ mncd this attitude, claim-

that tin students should not be
