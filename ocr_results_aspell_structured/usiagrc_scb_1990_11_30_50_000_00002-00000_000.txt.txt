By Craig Wacker

It will take at least a semester
beforechangesintheparking policy
can be considered, according .to
James Work, director of Spectal
Services and Summer Aeuvittes.
The policy cannot be Ilnalllt‘ld until
then because the construction of
the new Harris Center has caused

disturbance ofthe previous parking
patterns, said Work.

The ortginit] purpose of the new
parking policy. said Work, was to
financially spread the cost of hav-

would he an effect ofthe area being
designated as a short term or high
usage area where a permit would
cost a higher fee.

“The parking Situation is not
nearly as messy on campus," said
Work.

Work at so praised the increased
enforcement or the parking policy

parking lot have been' cleared or
cars which once parked there lllcV
gttlly. The previous situation, said
Work. would have prevented tire
engines from reachingthe Fonim if
a fire had been taking place.

Tltc funds gathered from the is
suance of parking permits is 5th
nil‘tcantly less than the cost to
maintain dteparkinglotsaccording
to Work. What the funds will pay
for this year are the costof labor for
ticketing, and the costs of the new
signs created to show various park-
ing zones. The general maintc~
nance ofasphalt surfaces in Iowa ts
ioilsome and expensive. added
Work. The weather conditions
cause repavement every few years.

Overall, Work said that people
can anticipate changes in any new
policy. He also added that not evr

policy.
