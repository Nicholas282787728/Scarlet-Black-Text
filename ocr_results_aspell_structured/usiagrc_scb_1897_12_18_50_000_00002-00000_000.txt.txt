THIS ISSUE of SCARLETAND BLACK
will be the last for this term No.

['r l8 a matter oi great regret that
'so few took advantage of the oppor-
tunity to hear President Aridrews’
lecture last evening. The lecture was
of high quality and was worthy of an
audience several times as large as the
one which assembled. While his
manner of speaking is not the most
forcible, the substance of the discourse
was excellent. It was not so rnircli
of the nature of a character sketch of
the great general as an orrtlirre of his
military campaigns.

SEVERAL AMENDMENTS to the rules
of the W. l. C. A. A. have been pro—
posed which are to be settled 'at the
next meeting of the board of control
of the association to be held soon in
Chicago. The Athletic Union meets
next Tuesday to discuss the changes
and to instruct our delegate. The one
of most interest to Grinnell students
is a proposal to debai all preparatory
students from participation in the
Chicago games. While such a rule

would be a disadvantage to us nextl
‘niircli interest to the Pl'OQ ini by

spring, it is certainly a step in the
right direction. 11' we overlook the
immediate misfortune and take a
broad view of the question it is evi-
dent that such an action would have
a good etl'ect on western athletics. ls
Ciriiinell to be found holding back lit
athletic reform which is sure to come
sooner or later, or takingr the lead
and sustaining her reputation for
purity in athletics?
