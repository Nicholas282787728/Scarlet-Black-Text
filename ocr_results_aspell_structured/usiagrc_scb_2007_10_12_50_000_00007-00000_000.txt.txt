Of rats
and rock

Castanets’ music defies
easy definition

BYJAMES ANTHOFER

Ray Raposa. who, with a constantly chang
ing group of fellow musicians, makes up the
band Castanets, was staring down a giant rat
in a friend’s Brooklyn apartment when 1 called
him to talk about his new album In the Viner
and his visit to Grinnell on OCL 30.

“Oh, [rats are] amazing.” said Raposa.
“\Vhenever 1 take the subway the first thing
I look forward to is the bearing on the tracks,
them scurrying around down there and stuff."

The subway theme runs through his new
album, It sometimes sounds like the growling
darkness beneath an underground mun, myster
rious and dense, Raposa's voice echoes wearily
above softly strummed guitar while synthesiz-
ers, round sounds,choirs and subtle percussion
give the songs an eerie stillness.

Raposa maps out all of the songs in ad-
vance on his guitar before moving to the stu-
dio to turn them into the creations that appear

on his albums. His ﬁrst two albums had a very
strong sense ot narrative and concept, but In
[/16 Viner differs from his previous work in this
sense. “I think maybe for this one I had a less
fully formed vision," said Raposa. “You work
on a thing for a couple ofdays in a studio and
the shape ofit makes itself apparent.”

His approach to music is highly collaborar
tive.The Castanets lineup is ﬂexible, with R“,
posa working with different musrcans for each
album. Among those collaborators is Asrhr
matic Kitty label-mate Suﬁan Stevens. “1 was
living in Brooklyn for most of this year and
Sufjan was also, so he was on this record," said
Raposa. “That's just me I can’t imagine be
ing on any other label. 1 mean, including the
other artists and the employees there, it’s just
astounding to me."

Despite this love of his colleagues and his
collaborative attitude (tour-mates Deer Tick
will make up some or his band when they play
together), Raposa doesn’t really involve himv
self with the freak folk, new folk, indie rock
or other scenes of artists like Okkeivil River,
Devandra Bernhart, sparklehorse or even
Low. all of whom Castanets recall sonically at
some points.

“I mean, I'm not swearing offindie rock as a
whole, but dude: with guitars, I’ve been around
that for a good 15 years or my life," said Ra—
posa. “I mean, there's a community there and
they're just great people in all differentways
[But] if we're on tour we‘re probably listening
to Hot 97 or whatever hip-hop channel we can
pick up."

Castanets has become well-known for giv-
ing live audiences an unexpected experience,
based less on the way the songs sound on
albums and more on improvisation. “I mean,
being raithful to the recordings is not a pri»
mary pursuit at all,"said Rapesa. “I mean a lot
of times it’s still a venue and/or crowd and/or
vibes specific thing. it would just be dishonest
to present it one way ifyou were playing like a
house show."

For an intimate venue like Bob's, students
can probably expect a fairly strippedrdown arr
mosphere. But the creativity ofRaposa and his
unique style and beliefs make the experience of
the show unpredictable. “it's very fruitful and
more fulﬁlling for an artist to keep things in
ﬂux as much as possible.”
