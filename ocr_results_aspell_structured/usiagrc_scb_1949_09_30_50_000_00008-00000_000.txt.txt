Lawrence Takes Grinnell

With True Viking Force /

By beating Grinnell 19.0 here last Saturday, the highly pole

ishcd, rugged Lawrence Vikings
about regaining their place as
ference.

The visitors ran the whole

showed that they are in earnest
champions of the Midwest eon-

Show in the first half, putting

across one touchdown in the opening perlod and two more ln the

second quartcr.

Lawrence started its first
scoring drive of the afternoon
from its own 34 yard line. Runs
by Reed For-bush and Bob Mc-
Cabe's passing gave the Vikings
a first down on the Grinnell
seven Forbush carried for five,
and on the following play Don
Exner cracked over the center
of the line to score.

A pass interception on the
Grinnell 37 presented the Wis-
consin team with its second
scoring opportunity. McCabe and
Forbush hammered down to the
Pioneer eleven as the lirst peri-
od ended. On the opening play
of .the second quarter McCabe
dashed around his own right end
to tally.

Lawrence ploughed and passed
54 yards to chalk up their final
touchdown. The big play in this
drive was a long pass to left
end 'Claudc Radtke who latter—
aled to Forbush wrth the half
back going to the one. Behind
perfect blocking, For-bush swept
around his own left end to go
over. Neilsen's kick was good.

Grinnell’s defense tightened
considerably during the last half,
and sparked by end\Mel White
and line backer Ed Aduddell.
The Pioneers held Lawrence
scoreless in the final two peri-
ids.

In the third quarter the Pio-‘

neer offensive started clicking.
and the Scarlet and Black moved
from the Viking 44 to the one.
A Parker to Thellman pass and
gains by Thellman and Hitch-

cock brought the ball to Within‘

ten yards of the double chalk
marks.

Three plays netted only threel

yards. 0n the fourth try full
back Rudy Miller skirted his

own right end, but was knockcdi

out of bounds on the one yard
stripe to end the only serious
Pioneer scoring threat of the af-
ternoon,

Religion Board
Launches Siudeni’

Discussion Group

the first meeting of the Student
Fellowship discusion group last
Sunday at Merrill Park, Meme
bers of the Board ot Religion
set up this group because they
felt that there was a demand
on the campus for a discussion
group with a religious emphasis,

Future programs are planned
to center on religious, moral,
and social problems. Faculty
and student speakers and visiting
college church speakers will lead
discussions.

Next Sunday the group will
meet at a p. m. in Cowles lounge,
and Mr. Paul Kunz (philosophy
and religion) will speak. Refresh-
ments will be served. A small
amount will be collected from
the group to pay for them.

“Best Fed Nation"

'lt li time to dispel the notion
that America is the best fed na-
tion,” says Dr. Glen King, sclene
(ic director 0.! the Nutritional
Foundation, “It is because the food
habits of many Americans are so
poor that we don’t make use 01
what we have." Dr. King points
out that some of the results of poor
food habits are lesions of the
tongue, lips, gums, eyes, and skin,
suhnormal blood formation and
goiter in 20 per cent to 40 per cent‘
of high schoul children in many
communities.

i This is the tenth year that
Grinncll has participated In the
Midwest conference, and the
Pioneers have found it rough goe
mg as far as winning league
crowns is concerned, The only
undisputed Pioneer title won in
the past decade is the track
championship in the spring of
1943.

The other lowa schools in the
Midwest Conference are Coe and‘
Cornell. Coc college, located atl
Cedar Rapids, calls its teams
the Kohawks. Last year they
had the dubious honor of being
Grinnell‘s only football victim,
lThe Cornell Rams from Mount
lVernon have won national fame
through their strong wrestling
team which takes on the best
in the country. In addition to
the circuit mat crown ,the Rains,
also hold the cross country titlel

Winner of’the conference foot-
ball championship last year was
Ripon college, Ripon. Wis, The
Rcdlnen went through 6 con—
ference games undefeated.

Pioneer fans have already seen
another Wisconsin team in ac—
tion, The Lawrence vikings, who
last year carried off the Midwest
tennis and golf titles.

The third Wisconsin repres
entative in the circuit is noted
for its powerful basketball
teams. Last year however, the
Bcloit Braces not only rolled
to the cage title, but also added
the swimming and track titles.

Grinnell takes on the only
Minnesota representative in the
league tomorrow at Northfield,
the home of he Carleton Carls.
Although repiitcd to be a strong
contender fog the football crown
this season,‘tbe Carls won no
titles last year.

Two Midwest conference
schools are cated in lllinois.
Knox college, known by the his
ttorie name dtf’md Siwash, is int
iGalesburg. The Monmouth col-
lege Fighting-Scouts, at Mon-.
mouth complete the nine team
loop. Neither of these schools
were able to take a title last
year. ..._

all strength are the obstnclcsl
that Grinnell laces tomorrow as]
they play Carleton at North
field, Minn.

While Coach Hank Brown’s
boys absorbed a 1970 defect
from Lawrence last Saturday,
Carleton was livmg up to ad-
vance notices and trounced Be— ‘
loit 27714. Grinnell scouts re-
ported that the score might have
been more lopsided if Carleton
had so desired. 1

The Carls use much the same
style of lootball as Lawrence,
running most of their plays from
the single wing and occasionally
using a T lormation. In the
backfield, Asp, the Carleton
quarterback is an excellent passe
er, and Wright, a halfback, is
one of the top brokenefield run-
ners in the Midwest Conference.
Carleton's veteran line is heav-
ier, but apparently not quite as
fast as the Lawrence line that
played so well here last week.

Last year Carleton won four
and lost two to finish in third
place in the Midwest Confer»
ence standings. They ran up 141
points, more than
team in the conference, and al~
lowed only 46 points to be scor-
ed by their opponents. Carleton
spoiled the‘ Pioneer home open—
er last year with a 13-0 Victory
over Grinnell. This year the 53-
man Carl squad includes 25 let-
terinen.

Coach Brown sees no dra.
changes in the Grinnell starting
lineup. lf Chuck Biermann, soph-
omere fullback, has recovered
lrom a leg injury he will prob-
ably start. Because of their good
work in last week’s game, Jack
Thellman, senior back, and Mel
White, end, have been named
tomorrow’s
