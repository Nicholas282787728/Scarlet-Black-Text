WOIVEEN WRITERS

A recent article on the book page of the Des
Moines Sunday Register criticized Virginia \Volff’s
theme in her book “A Room of One’s Own.” The
w ltcr of the article contends that Miss \Volff’s
belief that a woman should have her own place to
write and an income of at least $500 a year was
foolish. The reason given for this opinion was that
the ideas with which women writers would flood
the market would he worthless to society.

But it does not follow that, if women have
an increased opportunity to write and avail theme
selves of it, their work will he superﬂuous. From
the articles, books and . ndicated material which
have already been publ.llcd by women, much is
as good as similar writing done by men, Some
work which is not so praiscworthy may be the re-
sult of experiment, but as more women write, and
more writing is offered by women to the publish»
ers, competition will raisc the standards and elim»
illuto the useless. Nor is the amount of worthless
writing done by women greater in proportion to
that (lone by men. The very presence of women ill
the field may sharpen competition increase quality,
and decrcusc the quantity of worthless writing
done by both men and women. .

There is a chance for women interested in \\ rit-
ing to find a useful place in the field. As they find
their places they will discover better modes of c -
pression. The fact that more opportunities are
opening for paid positions in writing gives women
another help in this field. More of those who have
ability may devote their entire talent to their work
since sufficient remuneration makes them economr
ically independent.

WINTER SPORT

Grinncll has been unfortunate ill lack of facil-
itics for winter sports. The gymnasium floor is
not large, and the indoor track is smaller.

But Grinnell has a good pool, of dinlcn ions
adequate for the ill 'titution, and a men’s swimming
coach who can give instruction to men seriously
interested ill swimming. Thcre is little enough team
material that any man with a little talent in the
water has a good chance of making the team, and
the team is not made up until the lost tryouts
before every contest.

There are a number of lllcn in school who
might he very successful swimmers if they would
get out for the team. In any case they would get
first class exercise and training during the season.

WHEN TRADITION FAILS

The University News at St. Louis university
recently mmnlcntcd upon a Scarlet and Black odi-
tdrial which congratulated the, crusade carried on
by Richard Tobin, editor of the Michigan Daily.
The St. Louis writer, after adding his congratula-
tions to those of The Scarlet and Black, called at-
tention to an effort which the St. Louis newspaper
is making to secure smoking rooms in the Aris
and Science school.

While tll campaign scarcely placcs the Uni-
versity News in the 5 mo courageous class with
the editor of the Michigan plipcr, since the St.
Louis men. do not appear to be risking their officv
ial necks, it neverthel s presents 9. possible solu-
lion to a problem which exists in many schools,
Grinnell not excluded

The Scarlet and Black is not advocating it
smoking room in Alumni Recitation hall. This s
only to point out that the men do gathcr at (loci-
ways of class buildings to smoke at othcr schools,
and, just as ill Grinnell, such gatherings are not
favored. The matter was handled here through the
happy “tradition” which chased smokers across
the street. All Colleges cannot reach down in the
halldhasket of tradition and jerk out the right one
as easily, however.

When cold weather arrives the problem will
again present itself hero. Organizations sponsoring
the enforcement of the prcscnt tradition may do
well to decide what course they will follow tllcui

and u DlKlm' if the St. Louis ideal. of legal lg some
pllicc oil the campus for 'luokcrs is the most logical
.lflor lill.

'STUDTES AREN‘T EVERYTHING’

(From the Daily Trojan)

“studies aren't everything!" This is perhaps the
most perplexing and dangerous statement to be found
amid the great mass of advice offered to those begin-
ning college life. -

It is perplexing because it is a generalization, and
there is no way of judging how true or false it may be
in its application to individual cases.

It is dangerous because the average freshman tends
to interpret it as “studies are nothing." He beams when
the statement is quoted, and is so enthusiastic over it
that be may completely abandon all thoughts of study
for days at a time. It is a most convenient rationaliz-
ation for the lazy collegian.

So four years pass (with this philosophy it may
easily be five or six), during which time the student
has lived by his creed of “studies aren't everything." He
has entered into many extra-curricular activities, has
“made contacts," has "learned to meet people," and has
had a. pleasant interlude—but he has paid little atten-
tion to the mental training which is the primary reason
for the existence of higher educational institutions.

Then the college graduate enters business. Here, in
a short time, he discovers that his mind, which should
have been disciplined and [rattled during his scholastic
days, is unable 'to function with the precision necessary
in modern “high pressure” business.

And although no great success marks his business
life, he looks back to the “good old college days” when
he was a “big shot" and tells the younger generation
that “studies aren't everything."

COLLEGE MARRIAGE
(From the Iowa Wesleyan News)

Judge Ben Lindsay, famous exponent of “compan-
innate marriage” has advocated something new in the
way of wedlock. He calls it “college marriage," and de-
clares it is not Mia experimental kind, but a genuine
“until death do you part“ affair.

In particular “College marriage” is recommended
for students of middle westem schools, because, says
the Judge, most of these undergraduates lead frivolous
and indifferent existences. Marriage would give them
a more serious outlook on life. The problem of earning
a livelihood and it’s relation to a thorough preparation
in college would hold their attention. Realization 01
greater responsibilities would cause the student to re-
gard his work with a seriousness which he does not
otherwise.

And although Lindsay admits there might he an
occasional individual who would find il— expedient to
postpone matrimony until after college days, he believes
that many would find it advisable to marry in their
sophomore or junior years, and not Waste further time
in love-making.

in general we fail to agree with him, In our opinion
students are not prepared for wedlock; and while We
are forced to agree that students are pretty wasteful
of their opportunities, we doubt whether marriage
would greatly improve them. But the roost serious as-
pect of all is the matter of finance. Evidently the Judge
holds that discredited and very trite belief which de-
clares two can live as cheaply as one; we don’t. In fact,
thousands of incidents prove our standpoint. A young
fellow who finds it difficult to pay his tuition certainly
Would not be able to keep a Wife in ten dollar shoes.

Besides most college students are hardly mature
enough to face marriage. They are yet in a plastic
stage, and their nifectiorls are apt to flit about.

There are undoubtedly exceptions, however. When
parents possess considerable property, money is no
barrier. Couples could hover under the protecting wing
of the parental pocketbook until the bread-whine ’sl
earnings were sufficient to provide the necessary fundsl
for support. Then too, more are cases where individuals
reach a. mental Iinl—y early in life. They have definilcll'
decided who they desire for partners, and their Chili
will not change.

If both of these requirements are found in an :11-

dividual, we consider “college marriage" advisable. But ,

we are sure that the number of such persons is rel ..i
Lively rather small. Most college men and Women i'l. i

it to their advantage to avoid conjugal ties until ibr r '

schooling is completed.

Frank Duncan, who heloro this sea»
son had never donned a football s it.
into an outstanding end and the lead-
mg scorer of the conference was re-
markablo. HC is the host pass-receiver
in this section of the country, loud
his total of 37 points was one more
than that of Walter Earham, Cow-
boy halfback, who is awarded a hall-
haek position on the second team.

Brill-y Gcts 1’1le

Possessed with natural football
ability, Duncan was a sure tseklcr,
and if he continues to improve next
season, he should be one of the lead
ing ends of the midwest. Paired wlth
him at end is Captain Brilcy ol Drake,
whose work was good but who did
not measure up to past performances,
nor the rapid pace set by Duncan.

Oscar Christoffersen, Grinncll cen—
ter outplayed every one he nict with
the possible exception of McMIchacl
of Drake. The Bulldog center was re-
sponsible for some poor passing, how—
ever, while Christofierscn was seldom
guilty of any mistake. The Pioneer-
tow»hcad proved particularly brilliant
on defense.

Graflunrl Under fluted

Blanch of Drake and Dotter of
Oklahoma A. 8:. M. were almost unan—
imous choices for the tackle positions.
With Oates at guard is McMiehael,
the Drake fullback who plugged a
gap in the Bulldog line at center,

and was Ossie solem's most depend-

able lineman. He is not a, natural
center and consequently is awarded
a guard berth.

Probably the most underrated
player in the conference was Fred
Graflund, Pioneer fullback, whose
splendid blocking and fine defensive
work in backing up a light line play»
ed a large part in G'rinneil's success.
Along with Graflund and Thomas in
the backfield are Lloyd Lansrud,
Drake line—plunger, and Hayden
Trigg, Aggie back, who stood out as
the best regular halfback in the con»
ferenee. His versatility makes him
a constant threat.

Duncan Retains Lead

in Conference Scaring

Frank Duncan, Coach L. L. Walt‘s
outstanding discovery of the gridiron
se son, carried oil high scoring hone
ors in the Missouri Valley confcl nee,
despite the fact that he was playing
under two llandlcaps. First, this was
his first year of football competition,
and second, all his points were scored.
from an end position,

Catching seven passes, six for
tonchdowns and one for a point afici-
touchdown, he amassed a total of 37
points, one more than the total of
Walter Barliam, Oklahoma Aggie
halfback. Duncan was an ontstanding
threat at all times, and won all-Valley
honors.

Eldon Lindstrom, Drake’s sophr
omore quarterback, was in third place
with 35 points, while Sid Clarke, and
Hayden Trigg, Aggie backs, and
Lloyd Lallsmd, Drake lino-plunger,
followed in the order named.
