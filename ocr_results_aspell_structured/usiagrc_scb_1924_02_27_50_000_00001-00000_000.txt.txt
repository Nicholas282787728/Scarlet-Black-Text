Benz and McBride Will Duel for
Valley Lead; Oklahoma 15
In Good Condition.

With the liausas defeat to spur them

on, the pioneers journey to Norman to
' take on tho gklohoina Sooucrs ....io-
night. -

Oklaiioma at one time was a proiir
incut contender for tiie Valley tivlcv
but they have taken a slump in (bot
last few games and are out of the
race. However they were without a
game last week, and should be in
excellent shape to tangle with the
Pioneers who are playing- the second
game of a hard road trip. 1n 31L
dition, this is the last game of the
SOOner's season, and they will put
forth an extra effort to make a brll-l
liant i h of the season before a
home crowd. McBride, the Colliery
eiicc leader, and Wallace, who is now
in fourth place, can be counted on to
score frequently, unless the Pioneer
delense tightens up, and watches
them closely. ,

Brilz r uclirido

The game will he liter-ally a contest
botwcen McBride and Benz. for the
Valley scoring honors. At present,
Melaride has 145 points, and the Pious
eer captain has 141, but this will be
McBride's last game, while the Scar-
let and Black have yet another game
with Drake. In order to retain his
position as Valley leader, McBride
must not only score more than Benz
in this one game, but score enough so
that Benz cannot pass him in the
Drake game.

Both men will probably be closely
watched, as each team is anxious to
have their captain head the list, How—
ever, this will be an advantage for
Benz, because the closer he is watch
ed. the moi fouls arc committecd
1177‘ ‘nhL biiu’ and the r‘ innell leade'
is the best in the valley in shots from
the free throw line.

Pioneers last night, cau undoubtedly
be counted on to hit the ring, as can

ing their usual scrappy game at
guards, the Sooners will have all
they can do to snatch a victory.

Bulldogs Overcome Three-Basket
Lead to Defeat Pioneers
In Closing Minutes.

The Drake Bulldogs won 25 to 23
from the Pioneers in El bitterly cun-
tested game played at Grimell last
Saturday night. The fray was close
from the start, but Drake was behind
until the middle of the second half
when by a rally she forged ahead and
finished in the lead.

Grinnell opened the scoring when
Benz grabbed the ball from the first
tip off to dribble through to the basket
and count. The Bulldogs then caged
one, and for a while scoring rim on
even tcrms. The Pioneers gradually
obtained a lead and were out in from
18 L0 12 when the half endil.

Drake Braces

It was It better team [but [2|ch
Mchachruil’s men in the second per-
lot}, and with Boelter and Everett gar
ing strong the Drake quintet scored
thirteen to Grinnell’s ﬁve. With a
few minutes to play the Des Moines
lads got a three point advantage. Benz
then tossed in along one and Winters
made a free throw to tie it at 23 all.
Mautz then made good on a pair of
tool shots and won the game. Griunell
tried hard in the last few seconds, but
Drake stalled and the Pioneers could
get no more shots,

Both teams performed in good lush»
ion, although the Scarlet and lllaclt
cagers made (L much better showing in
the first half than in the last. The de~
tensive which the’ Pioneers displayed
in the last two minutes 01' the first
period was the host seen on the local
gym this year. Drake found it almost
impossible to work the hall much past
the center of the floor.

Benz played one of his best floor
games of the year and made nine
points, five of which were by his fa—
vorite free throw method. Gelvin and
Boge had five each to their credit,

Boeitor and Everett were the main

Builds Dormitory, Increases Its
Enrollment, and Receives
Helpful Endowments.

Dining the past year a new down
has licen built at Porter Middle
school, the boys high school which
forms half of Grinnell-inChina at
Techou‘, shahtung. The immediate
result of this addition is an increased
enrollment of one hundredand forty-
hine. The strategic importance of
this advance is evidenced by the fact
that it is thc only work of its kind
in 33 counties of Shantung province.

A local friend of the Grinnell-in—
China movement has contributed
money to endow speaking contestsl
The Chinese students in Grinneil have.
coutributed funds to endow prize esv‘
say contests. Friends in Cleveland
have given funds for new map equip-
ment. in various other ways prov-is
ion has been made for improving the
material equipment uoce -y for of-
" the teaching.

This growth in size, and the various
clicouragements to better wo , prom-
ise that Grinnell-iuschinrt will become
increasingly on intellectual center in
like Shunt-mg province,

One of the most encouraging facts,
from the financial standpoint, con-‘
tained in the annual report Just re
ccived, is that the Chinese students
in the school have themselves paid lor
tuition $400.00 more than has ever
been received before. The high
scholastic standards of the Portcr
school are commending it more and
more to those Chinese boys who want
the best educational work available
in the province.
