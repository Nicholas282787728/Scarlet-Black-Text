Iused new life into the society and
everyone is looking forward to a

trill oi interest and ploﬁl.

The meeting last Saturday eves
ning was interesting in that sevs
cral new members had a part on
the program, and because of the
exceptionally novel and entertain-
ing music. and the enthusiasm
manifested in the debate.

Current events, by Smith, was
given extemporaneously, and in a
manner which enabled the society
to readily grasp the great move-
ments in the world at large, as de
veloped during the week.

a departure from the usual paper

'which was much enjoyed by all.

the debate is tu be held this year
at a much earlier date than hele—

advantage to us, as in the debate
oi ’97 the late date was a decided
disadvantage .lowa College will
probably never have any better-
opportunity to retrieve her record
along the line of debating, than
the present. It is only fair to
state however- that Cornell

decision was given in invor oi the
negative, simply because the burr

ﬁrmative. This fact does not
seem to have been generally llllr
derstood and we mention it to give
encouragement to those who are
to be Grinnell’s representatives- in
this year’s debate. The import
