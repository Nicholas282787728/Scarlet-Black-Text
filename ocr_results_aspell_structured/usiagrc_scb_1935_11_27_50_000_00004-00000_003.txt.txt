STEADY SMOKERS SAY

WILLIE HOPPE, champion ofchnmpions,
and mosr famous personality of the bile
liard world! Mr. Hoppe has learned that
a mild cigarette nﬂ’ords more pleasure..,
and shut mildness is essential to one who
prizes healthy nerves, He says: “Champi—
onship billiards call {or henkhy nerves.
1r was a happy day for me when I rnrned
to Camels. I found I could smoke all I
wish and never have ‘edgy‘ nerves, 1 have
smoked Camels for a long rime, and I
want to compliment Camels on their
rnildness. 1r musr take more expensive
rohaccos ro give that special Camel liavor
I like so much—dways cool and good."

on your nerves. .never rire your rnsre.
