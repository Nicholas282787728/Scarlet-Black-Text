Students Sound Ott, Get Results

by Kyle Schanb
Reverberations trom the Sounding
Board are resulting in some posi-

tive changes, some of which will
be seen after mid»semester break,

Foureslice toasters will be instal-
led in both dining halls after the
necessary wiring is completed to
augment the present systemlor per.
sonal tastes. Each $150 appliance
will be kept company by an elece
tric soup tureen to comprise a
hot-item sellrservice bar,

According to Ralph Pomerenk, Dir
rector of Student Services, the Coir
lege was able to act on the idea
from the Sounding Board with”mar-
gin" funds resulting tram the difl~
erence between board rates and Mr
tual Costs.

Other Changes

Other changes are more directly
related to food rather than conven-
ience measures Quad Saga Manager
Dave McConnell said that scrambled

. eggs will be served more otten at
his end of the campus inthemorning
due to repeated requests, although
students may order eggsfive ways
(hard and soft boiled, scrambled,
poached, fried) during the first halt
hour of hot breakfast.

Jerry Ramaker, Food Service Di-
rector, also commented on Sounding
Board-inlated changes. He explained
that due to student complaints, hot
dogs are only ottered perhaps 50%
ot the time as when they appear on
the otticial Saga menus planned in
California Commenting on their
frequency, he added that national
statistics show that hot dogs are
second only to hamburgers in stu
dent popularity.

Green Woes
, The St. Patrick’s Day dinnerrolls,
with their striking emerald green
marbling, received so much negative
comment that Ramaker feels that

they will’notbe ottered a‘gain, despite
his personal teeling that they werea
great experimental success.

Another item which will not appear
again this semester is the sandwich
bar. Ramaker said the Sounding
Board results showed strong nega-
tivv reaction to the meal, although
students enjoyed it last year,

Tasteetestlng is another area which
has developed since the Sounding
Board began. McConnell Said that
every entree is tasted by three dill-
erent persons including himselt be»
tore it is served

Volume

The Food Service committeeis stilt
being kept busy tabulating the Sound
ing Board sheets as volume remains
high—-slx to eight forms are com—
pleted every meal, Ramaker esti-
mates the total return to be "sec-
eral thousand.”

There are some north/south came
pus variations in the replies. pdme
erenk stated that more torms are
tilled out on north, due to their
“more expressive" nature. Cowles
Saga Manager Tom Dixon contirme
ed the fact that north campus near
ple tend to be more verbal about
tood conditions.

North also tends to concentrate
more on meat matters, while south
shows more concern for the bastc
toods, according to romerehk.

Shilts

Sounding Board comments in gen-
eral have shitted in nature since
opening in February. McConnell said
that they now are 9079591, uselul
instead ot severalbeing justobscene
words. And ot this percentage, 80%
are complimentary, which isamuch
higher tigure than tirsi received.

McConnell and Dixon still checkthe
Board alter every meal, and they
are gone overtogether withthe cooks
atter every noon meal. McConnell
particularly leels thatthe comments

Offerings

are valuable since the cooks theme
selves are reading the students’
rather blunt and direct criticisms
which tend to get the idea across.

Worth

In evaluating the worth of 3 Sounds
mg Board comment. Ramaker said
that single comments are looked at,
but not as seriously as several
complaints about one item. He still
leels that there is a lot of unwritt-
en complaints, so that those which
do get written show student con
cern.

Both Ramaker and Dixon have one
anged their original opinion about
the Sounding Board. They felt it
would just be a lancy hitch board
for obscene comments, such as
the original Saga ”beef hoards.”

Time and experience have change
ed their attitudes, and they both
are enthusiastic about the results.
Ramaker has even described the
Sounding Board twice in an oltlci-
a1 Saga bulletin “Idea ot the Week"
column.

Success

Pomerenk attributed the success
at the Sounding Board to making it
ditticult to ignore by constantly
supplying it with paper, pens and a
writing surtace and setting it up
in open areas. He also felt that stur
dents can see immediate results
from their comments so that they
now have confidence in the system.

Impeachment: The

l
by Rep. Tom nailsback

WASHINGTON, D.C.e-Hundreds of
letters, petitions, coupons, andtele-
phone messages on the issue of im-
peachment have crossed my desk in
recent weeks. Their source are cits
izens from within my district and
throughout the United States who
represent most segments or the
political spectrum. Their percep-

nnr radius R nalbseacit

tions and conclusions differ Signi-
flcantly, but their deep and sincere
concern is an element which most
have in common, This concern is so
real and so great that it has pro-
mpted many of them to write their
Congressman tor the tirst time in
their lives.

Although many individuals otter
only words of hope that the inquiry
will be conducted tairly, the maj-
ority clearly stand for or against
impeachment. To date I have re—
ceived approximately 900 prorimv
peachment letters, and son letters
opposing impeachment trom my con-
stituents alone} ln addition, we have
received some 700 anti-impeach
ment coupons and petitions in supr

, port or impeachment with hundreds

ot signatures. it anything is appar-
ent trom these communications, itis
that no direct correlation exists
between political parties and a par-
ticular position on this issue. Re-
publicans and Democrats alike have
both opposed and proposed the im-

l’ublic Reacts

peachment of President Nixon in the
numerous letters and messagesl
have seen,

Other sources have reinforcedthis
pattern at public reaction to impea»
chment. In recent visits in my dis-
trict, lhave encountered strong teet-
ings on both sides of the controver-
sy. Organized labor, a signiticant
section ot my constituency, are in
firm agreement with the national la-
bor prosimpeachment position. Ma.
ny farmers, who comprise an equally
important segment of my district,
have olten discussed with me their
disapproval ot the impeachment app~
roach. Initial and incomplete tabur
lations ot my annual survey ot Dis»
trict sentiment indicate an almost
even splitbetweenthose holding prev
impeachment and/or pro-resignae
tion posttions and those in tavor ot
President Nixon’s continuation in 017
lice.

The political realities of such str
rong public reactions inherent in
the issue or impeachment may be
seen by many as a tactor which wo-
uld restrict congressional objecti-
vity in reaching the ultimate deciSr
ion to vote for or against impeache
merit. But i interpret the circumr
stances differently. With such even—
ly divided but tirm public reaction, '
reactions crossing all party lines,
the “politically safe" decision does
not exist. No partyeline positions
will present an easy answer. Each
member will be on his own in rea-
ching a personal decision to cast a
vote at Aye or Nay. The door to
objectivity, therefore, is not ciao
sed, but opened by the strong pub-
lic reaction on theissue olimpeach»
merit expressed by the American
public.

When the hour comes to castavote
on the issue ot impeachment, I am
convinced that the vote must and will
be cast on the basis of evidence far
irly gathered and tully evaluated
and not on the basis of party atte
iliation or political fears.

Mull lelevising Congressional Debates

RANDDR, paee'rv Guide Magaz-
ine reports that hackers ot a plan
to televise Congressional sessions
have suggested the creation ot a
Congressional Broadcasting System
modeled atter unitedNations cover-
age.

Under the plan, the system would

probably be operated as an arm at
the Library of Congress. Cameras
would provide live gavel-tovgavel
coverage, tor immediate use or to
be taped tor later broadcast.

chambers,
