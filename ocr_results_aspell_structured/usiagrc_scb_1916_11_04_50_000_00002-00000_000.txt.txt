One or the host examples or oplia
intern that Grim-tell has ever seen has
recently heen shown by one who is
intimately known to everyone cone
nected with the College. When the
victim of an accident, he immediately
sent word fol" someone to come and
bring him home in an autumohile,7
and at the time he had tour hrokeii
rihs. a hi-oken collar hone and iullu»
merahlc hrmses. when the news or a
Coe vic:oi-y was brought to him at the
hospital he showed wonderful ability
to overcome pain and was glad to hear
the hen . And yesterday, as an en?
thnsiastic student body gathered ahout
his home he left the sick bed, walked
to the window, antl ivitli his inevitable
smile gestured to the cheering mohi

“In Old itcnttt .
Those who witnessed the presenta-
tion or the old tashioned play, “Ill
Old Kentucky." Thursday Night, saw
a drama which never seems to grow
old to an American audience. Source
how or other a group or colored men
on the stage in a typical southlaiid
scene is alw attractive.

The most interesting feature or the
play the other night was the dancing,
or more properly termed “jigging,” oi
the colored actors in the play. some
unusually good woilt was shown in
this line, and the audience expressed
its approval hi- ri-equciit clapping. In
the second act, ﬂllvllllllsllally long time
was consumed in acting witlioii' ok»
on words, and ire think this is proh-
allly‘ one or the longest instances on
record at a pantomime or this kind by
a large group oi iiicu.

The interpretation hr the actors.
oucside oi that hr llallic liycis, who
played the part of Madge Brier the
girl iioiii the mountains, was only ot
mediocre variety, hut the, other fea-
tures ot the evening made the play
entirely worth while.
