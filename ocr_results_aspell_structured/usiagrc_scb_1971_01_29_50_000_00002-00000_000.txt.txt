ReviewsLeggeHPlan

Having just read President
Leggett's proposal for includ-
ing students in the academic
decision-making process (and
having been briefed as towhat
to expect), I have a number of
initial comments on the pros
posal.

As might be expected, Iam
going to say that the plan does
not go far enough. It doesn't.
In fact, symbolicallyandpracr
tic-ally, it represents very lit-
tle change whatsoever. The
faculty and the faculty’s Exe-
cutive Committee still have
almost complete control over
academic decisions. The only
change is that students have
been allowed to sit on a subs
committee of the Executive
Council which will consider
all academic matters except
for personnel decisions and
dishonesty cases. The most
dismaying phrase in the entire
proposal is the following:
“with the understanding that
the President, (the two deans
and the faculty chairman) may
ask the Executive Council
(members alone) to meet as a
whole at any time to consider
or reconsider any of the
actions taken by the separate
subcommittees." There is no
reason or excuse for this ph-
rase. The only decision on
which the Subcommittee on
Educational Policy (SCOEP -
the one with students) has
final say (subject to the above
limitation) is on course pro-
posals. All other decisions
must be returnedto the faculty
for final approval.

As a student powerproposal,
this rates zero; as a proposal
for student input in decision—
making, it is a step forward.
One of the most promising
clauses of the proposal‘is the
one which callsfora teacher
evaluation, plans to be formur
listed by SCOEP and approved
the the faculty. This would
allow for student input in per-
sonnel decisions, although,
again, no student power. U“,
fortunately, student input is
not even mentioned in the
section on personnel decis-
ions. Iwouldrecommendmenr
tion of student input especially
in sections D3a-2 and 3 deals
ing with faculty hiring and
dismissal.

The entire proposal reads
as a faculty organization pro-
posal. The style and tenor of
the proposal implies that these
are faculty matters to be de-
cided by the faculty, with only

a, minimum of student input.
To correct that tone, [would
recommend that section A3a
be tetally revised to give stud-
ents formal authority to
“share with the President the
responsibility of determining
the educational policies of the
College." All responsibilities
delineated under that section
could properly be shared with
the students

Section C, dealing with the
Divisional EPC'S is an excel*
lent section, except, again,
that it does not mention stud-
ent input on personnel decir
sions; my major objection to
this section is that there is
not a similar one legislating
student participation at the
departmental level.

In fact, overall, the major
weakness of this plan is that
it does not ensure student
participation at the grass-
roots foundation of power in
this college -- the depart-
ments. When asked about this,
President Leggett expressed
the fear that such a section
might muse the entire plan to
be defeated. My response is
that student participation in
academics is defeated unless
it begins at the grassroots.
The second major weakness
of the plan is that the faculty
and the Executive Council
(faculty and administration)
are given the power, the right
and the privilege of overturn-
ing any of the actions of
SCOEP. If SCOEP must refer
its decisions at all (andthatis
not a forgone assumption), it
should refer them either to a
joint student'faculty body or
to the faculty and to the stud-
ents. That student body could
be a referendum, an alI~camr
pus meeting or' some repres-

entati-ve ,group- uof w students:

The CollegeSenatewhich Pres
sident Leggett has considered
probably should become the
body to which SCOEP’s pro—
posals are referred.

President Leggett is sincere
in his desire to include studs
ents in academic decision-
making, and he appears to be
still open for ideas. [question
the philosophy of making this
an interim proposal; I don’t
think faculty and students are
as tired of reform as he be
lieves. Let us make this pro
posal into one whichwillallow
for full studentparticipation in
decisions, not just the slight
input that President Leggett
has here proposed.

Kaufman Sees "War Profiieering”

by Bill Knecht

Richard Kaufman charged

last Friday that the United
States government is allowing
an ”excessive defense bud-
get,” which threatens to "
litarize sections of civilian
life."

Kaufman, a four-year veter~
an of the JointEconomic Com»
mittee, spoke to a capacity
audience Friday afternoon in
the South Lounge. He cited
examples of such military
ventures as the GSA trans
port plane to illustrate what
he terms "war profiteering.”

According to Kaufman, the
C7 SA is typical of most civil-
ian defense contracts. Beset
by time and cost overruns,
this project will cost taxpay~
ers some 60% more than the
original cost estimate, with
fewer than the original num-
ber of planes delivered and
the costrperrpiane jacked up
from $7 million to$56million.

Kaufman said that the Office
of Management of the Budget
is‘ undﬂstaffed and unable to
adequately review each indie
vidual case in our enormous
defense budget. Furthermore,
negotiations with defense con-
tractors are made in secret,
making it difficult for the OMB
to determine whether or not
negotiated contracts are fair
in their cost or realistic in
their promises.

Contractors can get away
with time delays, cost over
runs, and substandard prod-
ucts because records of what

terms were privately nego-
tiated years ago are usually
sketchy at best. Contract re-
view boards must usually ac-
cept on faith excuses for cost
overruns and delays, since
only rarely do they possess
the technical knowledge and
time necessary to research
the claims. They are faced
with a choice betweenyielding
to the contractors' demands
or losing what has been in‘
vested already. Almost in-
variably, the contractors' de-
mands are met.

Often, companies smte that
they will go bankrupt if con-
tracts are not continued. This
would precipitate unemploy‘
ment and would thrmten other
contracts held by the same
companies. In Kaufman’s
words, the threat is that of
“a fortyrton dinosaur coming
to your front yard and threats
ening to die.” This is barely
more subtle than outaand—out
blackmail, but it works, and
so is used.

Due to the fluidity of moves
nienr. between high: level civl
ian defense and militaryposf
tions, a sort of camaradarie
develops between businessand
the military. Relations ape

sight of taxpayers.

Kaufman posited the needfor
better records of contractne-
gotiations and more adequate
staffs to review them. He fur
ther argued that the ties be-
tween business and the mili-
mry could be severed by sep-
arating civilian defense cor-
porations and the military by
a civilian militaryrprocure'
ment board. Such a board
would consider the military‘s
requests and then purchase
weapons systems which it the
ought would do the job.

In the final analysis, Kauf-
man explained, the best way
to reduce military spending
would be to reduce the overall
level of monies appropriated
to the Armed Forces. Pre-
sumably, the military oper~
ates on. a priority system.
Thus, if funds were cut, some
of Lhe.superfluities would have
to be abandoned.
