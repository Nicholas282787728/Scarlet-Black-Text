Men 5 Government
Undergoes Change

Senate and Court of Seven Years
Standing Are Abandoned.

Radical changes have been etlected
this last semester in the men's gore
ernment oi Grhlnell college. The old
Court and Senate or sercn years
standing have been replaced by House
committees and a Council of House
Chairmen,

This change was brought about as
a climm‘ '0 the weelrs of discussion
which toliowcd the Strident Court de-
cision on the liquor charge against
Six students. The governmental
authority in the dormitories now
rests with separate house committees,
three upperclassmen in their own
house, and major nifenses are taken
care oi by the Dean oi men and the
President. There is no written con-

:stitutinn, although it is expected that
one Will he evolved as time goes on.

The Council of House Chairmen,
composed of the six treads of the
men's halls, is a legislative group
taking over that function of the old
Senate. The House committee plan
was put into effect Monday, April 23.

Student government has been one of
the main topics of discussion since
February 2, when the men students
protested in mass meeting against the
action or the faculty administrate
tion committee in suspending si. stu-
deuts because of alleged participation
in a liquor party, after the Student
Court had announced its inability to
make a decision. The matter was re-
ferred back to the Court as a result,
which hotly sot almost continuously
for nenrly ﬁfty hours and finally
recommended the sus ension of two
men not among the o inal six,

At another mass meeting on Eehru-
ary 7 the Court, in announcing its de-
cision as accepted by the administra~
tion committee, indicated by written
statement its unwillingness to accent
further responsibility for men's lite
because of the prevailing attitude of.
non»c00peration among the men.

Certain reforms in the existing
government were suggested by the
SCARLET AND BLACK, the Lantern
society and the Senate, and embodied
in amendments to he voted on by the
men February 11, However, in the
midst of the voting, President Main
announced in chapel his belief that
Grinnell had tailed in a great crisis
and asked that a, student committee
consult with him concerning revision
in the gounment. . o,

Robert Eurlingame chairman,
Blayne McCurl-y and Carl Kunath
were named tor this committee. That
same afternoon the President an-
nounced to these men who met with
him that the Men’s Senate and Stu-
dent Court are declared non-opera~
tive."

To this committee Ralph Harris and
Paul Smiley were added, and this
group, in conjunction with the faculty
committee of Professors J. W. Gonna»
way, E. D. Strong, and R. H. Pei-ring,
studied the situation from all angles.
The present government is the result.

The changes in the men's govern-
ment necessitated a revision of the
Student Council constitution. This
was done and the old Senate and

eagne Board members or that body
were made elective through nomina-
tions by the League Board and Coun-

il of House Chair-men. The all-cor
lege activities of thc old Senate \verl‘

By actual statistics, Cottage Three's

sag is due to the strenuous use it
