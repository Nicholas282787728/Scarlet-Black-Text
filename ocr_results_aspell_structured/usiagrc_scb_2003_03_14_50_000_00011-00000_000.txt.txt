The Grinnell Historical Museum features 100-year-old local history and newly expanded hours

by Michael Andersen
News Editor

The best things Katie Lee ‘04 gets to show people, she said, are also the
worst things she gets to show people.

They're in a pair ofglass-liddcd boxes hanging from the walls oran upstairs
bedroom.They’re Victorian hairweaves. During the nineteenth century, women
would ooIleet hair that fell from their hearh, trade it with one another to gather
a variety oreolors and weave men: into complut root-long sculptures orhuman
hair The Grinnell Historical Museum happens to have
two ofonly a handful remaining in rhe country,

Lee said she ﬁnds the idea “a little creepy." but she
relishes explaining it when she's guiding tours through
the museum. “Most people have never hmrd orit," she
said. “It's fun to see how they react. "

The Grinnell Historical Museum looks like a house.
It has a grass lawn. a front porch and a bnnd new three.
vehicle garage. But professionals mow the lawn, nobody
ever xiu on the porch and all three vehicles in the garage
were designed to be drawn by horses, And there are some
odd things in the main building, too.

They’re arranged as might be expectedirefrigeramr in the kitchen, toys in
the playroom, old clothes in the basement. But almost every object in this house
has a little tag attached to it with a name and a date. The older, yellower tags are
typewritten. The whiter ones are in blue pen.

"One of the things they’ve tried [0 do with :h: museum is make it look like a
home and notyust put it in ashoivrase," said Lee. “so tlietesdunerall over me plane."

The house that is now 1125 Broad st. may have been "the most incredible
house in Iowa" when it was built in 1895, Lee said. The owner orGrinircIl's
general store pa.d top dollar for running water, electricity and central hearing
(all orwhieh are still working today), when he died childless, his longtime maid
inherited th: house; when she died, the museum bought the estate.

One of the things they’ve
tried to do with the
museum is make it look
like a home and notjust
put it in a showcase."

For years, a pair oflongtimc volunteers did almost all the work maintaining
the museum. organiaing its displays and keeping irs records up to date. Betty
Ernst ,oined the museum in 1974. Lois Mercham joined her in 1988. last
summer, Meaeham, so, and Ernst, 94, finally resigned from the museum's board.

This taught their compatriots off guard. “The board didn't do much at all,"
said Barry Moiretc a current member ordie board, “berame they didn’t have to."

Meaeharn had planned to help oversee the transition that followed. but due
to ill health she was unable to contribute as much as she had hoped.

The results orthis sudden independence were some.

in to perrorm many ofMeachem's and Ernst’s old duties.
“\Wherc are things k:pri’ Where's the toilet paper,) There's
no toilet paper. Where are the paper towels?"

After learning the ropes, though, the new board
members set about overhauling the museum‘s program.
The house is now open twice as many hours during
the winter, puts out a seasonal newsletter and hosts
occasional community events like cider and chestnut
parties last Christmas and blacksmithing demonstrar
tions this summer.

Lalonde, Muffctt said, has essentially held the institution together in the
wake ordae transition, blondc, who also manages the archives at Stewart Library's
Grinnell Room, estimated that she spends about 15.20 hours a month volun.

The museum, board members said. is widely known around town, and has

Expedition reveals Central wholesomeness

Central, cont. from p. 10

Central Partying
Dam: scarce,
11:15 am. Gary tells me Central is a dry—campus.
11:16 am. Gary tells me most students go home on weekends.

11:17 am. 1 tell myself there must be a connection between 11:15 and
11:16 facts.

Central’s Campus

Ccnrrztl has noccmuauonx and beautiﬁrattions that do not come from spray
paint cans or sticks orchalk

9 am. I notic: the campus has :1 lot ofstotucs; I realm: Grinncll has none.
Central also has a religious alnliation, hence their series oflarge steel crosses.

10:25 am. Back to the dorm. Central has a lot ofrountalns. Grinnell has no
fountains. Central is building a fountain in the science building that will ﬂow
inside and outside. Like a hotel swimming pooll Grinncli’s Campus Center
should incorporate some waterfalls, rust so as not to be outdone.

Central Dining

IfQuadertgulars balk at cowles because they say itlr as plastic as the people
who eat there, they'll positively destroy Central's dining options,

10:40 am. Hand [0 Grand Central Station, :i small extension ofthe main
dining hall.There'sa big'IV mounted high in onecorncr.Ahiige hamsterecngc-
like dispenser of breakfast bars, A grrmball machine. Carpet. The place to get
food reminds me ofcoircessions at sporting events.

12:10 pm. Go to lunch at the main cafeteria. It's sort orlike a shopping
mall food court. with workers behind all the servingstarions, which have campy.
alliterative names like “Very Veggie."Thete is a Willy Wonka-ish aspect: cookies

were waiting on humongous. piping hot cookie sheets. The trays are smaller
than ours, but have a raney college emblem in their corners. The glasses are
actually glass. Pepsi products. The place where you put dirty ri—ays is deﬁnitely
Willy Wonkamyou hurl your silverware down mysterious spouts which then
make \vhooshing sounds. I am impressed by the way central students have no
trouble walking in very orderly fashion. It‘s rather Oompa Loompa like, though
I see no green hair orsuspenders (not much died hair anywhere, in fact),

Central’s Wholesomeness

This might be where my Smdy veers toward merciless muckracking. I had to
ﬁnd something had. something:

8:40 am. Arrive and park on independence st, feeling a hit bombarded by
the name's wholesomeness. I am used to Grinnell’s Broad st.

9:05 a.rn. Meet my host. Gary is his name, and genuine is his game. All day
I try to ﬁnd some glimmer orcynieism, Jadedness. irrational rage! But no, He
oould be the nicrot person I've ever met,

9:15 am. Gary andI look at the cow, an online daily campus memo.
Finally, I see a glimpse orcentral meanness: iran event Is canceled, the Cner
doesn'tslmply remove it from the list; instead, it slashes lines through the listingl
Oh, the humanity.

10:22 am. In the lilinrry's winding central staircase, the ceiling is all mlr»
tors. This makes me feel really weird. I deride the stairwells musr serve the same
sex purpose as the Burlrng third and fourth ﬂoor bathrooms.

2:20 pm. Wander into the bookstore and notice that everything coso less
here. Peanut butter cups are only ten cents each: candy bars only 55 cents. But
I do find another notsowholesome central episode: they are selling individual
pouches orSwiss Miss hot chocolate: Those are not for inditirlual sale! so illegal.
And I'm a bit puzzled by the display for “Newest fad: Central College Rubber
Bands! 95 eenrsLisn't that lanky?
