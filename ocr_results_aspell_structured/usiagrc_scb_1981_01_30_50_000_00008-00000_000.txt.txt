Ever wonder what is behind the shade
ed windows of 1125 Broad Street? As the
small sign in front of the house says, the
building is the Grinnell Historical
Museum. A large portion of the history
at Grinnell is enclosed within the
darkened rooms of the old Victorian
house. Inside are all manner of Grinnell
memorabilia, old furnishings, artifacts
and photographs

Over so. years ago, four women's
clubs in Grinnell held a community im-
provement contest and the winning idea
was to start a museum society. in 1951
the Grinnell Museum Society moved in»
to rooms above the old Omnlngham's
Drug Store. The space was soon tilled
with items of historical interest which
the Society had solicited from Hie
townspeople Most of these displays no
longer exist, however, because the old
building burned in 1954 and few articles
survived.

The Society did not give up atter the
lire and was determined to establish
another museum. In 1958 the Society in»
corporated and appointed a board of 12
trustees. now down to nine regular
members, The original Museum Socie-
ty, tormed betore the incorporation,
became the Grinnell Museum Auxr
iliary. The Board of Trustees provides
and maintains the museum building

may

and the Auxiliary operated it. Most of
the museum‘s articles have been
donated but the Somety has a fevi things
on a 99-year loan irom the college.

A bit oi luck came [or the Society
when Ruble Burton donated her grands
lather‘s house to the group. That house
was not in a good location tor the
museum, though, and it did not have
enough space, 50 the Society obtained
Burton's permission to sell the house
and with that money it bought the house
on Broad Street, The only stipulation
Burton made in allowing the house to be
sold was that a room in the museum be
dedicated to her grandfather, Arthur
M. Burton, postmaster in Grinnell from
1921 to 1934,

The current museum building was
built by .l.il. McMurray, owner or a
drygoods, carpets and millinery store
in Grinnell. When his family moved into
the house in.1895 it was celebrated for
its beautiful golden oak woodwork and
ceramletlled ﬁreplaces. The original
woodwork and tiles are still in the
house.

The tour guide for the museum is
Rose Stoops. She is also the president of
the Auxiliary and has been since. as she
putit ' ldon't know when" The elderly
president sits on the enclosed front
porch of the museum on Friday and

Saturday alternoons waiting i'or
visitors. But Stoops says she actually
gives tew tours because or the lack oi
frequent visitors and so a totebag full at
reading material commands most ot
her attention on those alternoons. The
museum keeps a relatively low proiile
and that may be the reason for the low
number of visitors.

Stoops, herseii a graduate ot lowa
State University, used to teach high
school. She was born in southwest Iowa
and lived all over lowa before coming
to Grinnell. Because she had done a lot
or traveling and Visiting of museums
around the country, iriends in Grinnell
thought she could help in the Museum
Society. Stoops is full of {acts and anec
dates about Grinnell's history and she
relates these stories as she gives her
tours

The house is lurnished as a typical
upper-middle class home might have
been apprOXimately 100 years ago.
There are three floors oi exhibits and
each room is completely lull of items,
The front door opens into a short hall
and the tirst uring Stoops points out is a
desk which belonged to J.B. Grinnell.
The large and impressive desk sits in
an alcove surrounded by pictures or old
Grinnell College buildings and
photographs of J,B. and past college
presidents. Pointing out a photo at
President George Gates. Stoops said, "I
once told President Drake he was
George in." The iirst George was
President George Magoun.

Another corner of the hall is adorned
Wltl’i the photographs of many people
prominent in Grinnell's history. Among
them are several more college
presidents and Harry Hopkins. the
Grinnell graduate who became
Franklin D, Roosevelt's rightrhand
man,

Stoops walks next to the trout parlor
across the hall. Accessible through that
room is the back parlor. The tront room
furnishings include a melodean which
is over on years old and in the other
parlor sits an organ equally as olgl
which was donated by Mr. and Mrs.

. Paul Kiesel. A Victorola mat still works

occupies the corner of this room, Stoops
demonstrates its capabilities by win
ding its crank to play an old march
record.

One at the most interesting features
of the museum is its array of stained
and lead glass windows. The sun slanr
