Monitoring devices Disguised
as Tombstones

by J.Edgnr Iroover

The orinnell administration
has long been tinstratcd by
the lock or student discipline
on campus. The Scarlet and
Rhett has learned that the new
tombstone directories Scattered
around rampns are part or a
larger network or monitoring de
vices. While the directories are
only transmitter stations, the
numerous tombstones placed on
campus buildings and outside of
professors’ oil-ices are the actual
monitoring devices.

“I have no idea what you are
talking about,“ says Jim Teds
erman, director of student at.
rairs, although a source close to
Rich Ridgeway, director of pub-
Iic relations, reveals that the dc.
vices ore part or the overall plan
to improve the college's image.
“We get the beneiit or a u '
tied image as well as the ob .
ity to monitor and control [lb
tnre discontent. It‘s what Rich
and George [Drake] have been
dreaming of for years." Presie
dent Drake was conveniently out
of town and therefore could not
respond to Scarlet and Rhett
queri s.

Tom Hieteld, assistant pros
fessor of history and registered
cornplainec, complained that the
new measures were just another
way for the administration to
suppress the facility.

James Lincoln does not talk
with the Scarlet and Rhett, but
if he had spoken with us, he
would have discussed the pos
sible uses in verifying ﬁnancial
aid. He would have said, “We’ve
finally found something we can
use to really stick it to the stu-
dents. Witli tllis system, it'll be
no more Mr. Nicc- Guy.” Asked
if there ever was a Mr. Nice
Guy in iinnncini aid, Mr. Lin-
coln would have said, “No come
merit."

Asked what paid for tlle sys
tem. Ridgeway fudged, but ii-
Ilally under pressure acknowl»
edged that the funds would
come from a further cut in [is
naucial nid coupled with the re.
sources gained from effectively
closing the Health Center and
selling its stock or cough syrup,

aspirin, and especially condoms.
“We thought we had enough

money left over from the new
science bililding, but we then
discovered that we’d have to tap
into ﬁnancial aid to raise more
resources. Finding that inade
quote, we ﬁnally let old man Tee
derman close the Health Center
to raise more money. He’s been
pushing that for years, but it
just never ht into our old ‘we like
the students‘ image, but now
with an emphasis on national
reputation, strident health just
is not very llllportallL"

The heart of the new system
will be a tiny ofﬁce ﬁlled with
recording equipment that will l)C
hidden somewhere in the new
ARH. The college will stall the
room with professors 24 hours a
day. “At least it will give them
something to do in their news
found free time," explains Wally
Walker, rercrring to the 3-2 sys
tem.

Dale Huwn, outgoing head
of Building and Grounds, com—
plains, "How come they wait 'til
I leave before they get such a
nice toy, I mean, it’s just not
fair!"

Gigglesnorts Replace
Pioneers

by Sid and Marty Kraft

To campus cries of “Horkle
Snorkle Sniggley siioo," the
Grinuell College Athletic des
partrnent announced that from
this day forth the Grinnell aths
letic teams will be called the
Grinncll Gigglesnorts.

The change of the' name Pi-
oneers was brought about by
members orthc Studcnts to End
the Racinl Injustice or Unisex
Sports (SERIOUS). The orgar
nization resented the name Pi-
oneers as it promoted poor hy-
gicne among students. Accord-
ing to SERIOUS, history has
proven tlmt’the historical pics
nccrs went weeks without show-
ering or brushing their teeth;
yet the portrayal or pioneer lirc
is idealized by American cule
ture. According to SERIOUS,
by using the Pioneers as a nick
name, Grinnell College was ig-
noring the blatant lark oIeleau-
liness exhibited by the early set»
tlers.

Rcaction among the adminis-
tratiorl was mixed President
George Drake at ﬁrst was rcluc
tant to change, but once he l'er
alized that Griunell would have
the only GiggleSnort team in
the US. News and World Re-
port Top 10, he quickly ape
proved. Secretary of the Cole
lege Eill Deminoll‘ was unavail-
able for comment, as he was at-
tending o Billy Bragg concert
in Houston. Alumnus Herbie
Hancock Iound the name Gig-
gleSnurt to be atonal, and vowed
to retract his Ebony advertiser
rrrent until the name becomes
more musically inclined. How-
ever, the admissions department

applauded the name change.
Admissions director John Hops
kins commented, :‘We have been
ﬁghting for years to redo -thc
nickname, becausc we felt the
name Pioneer presents a roman-
ticizcd image oiineu and Women
sleeping together in the woods.
High-school students with SATs
over 1550 don't want to sleep in
the woods; they want beautiIul.
modcrn dormitories, like Norris
Hall.”

The name Gigglesiiort was
submitted by the same him

that creatcd Grinltell’s old new
logo. Athletic director Dee
Faircllild stated,“ The college
paid $40,000 for the new logo, so
it must be quality. wc wanted o
mascot of a similar high style,
so we went to them for ad-
vice." SERIOUS suggested the
name be changed to the c; '
nell Granolas, symbolizing c.
nell’s aim to diversity the cams
pus community into a mix of
fruits and nuts. At this point
in time. the members of SE-
RIOUS have no qualms about
the now mascot. According to
“Suzy," a SERIOUS nrenrber,
“Gigglesnort is a fine nickname,
and we hope it stays at Grinnell
College a long time. At least
until we determine that there is
something wrong with the por-
trayal or that nickname.“

The GiggleSnort mascot will
combine reaturcs or the Snuf-
inlnppagns and Bozo thc Clown,
and will be featured at next
week's baseball game. Tryouts
{or the GiggleSnort mascot will
be held on Monday. May I, at
7:30 pm. in North Lounge.
