practicality oi the latter, the pro-

black voters are as loyal and as en-
thusiastic about his candidacy as
they were in 1934, because they
turned out in large numbers to sup-
port him in the primaries across
the country, But we don’t really

other candidate I have some con
cerns with Jackson as a Presxden-
tial candidate, I think it's impor»
tant that someone establish the
legitimacy of a black person come
peting and being taken seriously.

My notion is that the Constitution is a living document,

that it evolvex. If you use original intent,

black Americans should turn in their outer registration cards

and return to slavery.”

 

Dukakis has a number oi policy
positions that I think black voters
would tind very appealing.
whether they can match some oi
those positions with the personality

another question.

What has Jesse Jackson's
emergence as a viable Presiden-
tial Candidate done for the future of
black candidates?

Dr. Pinderhughes

By running in 1984 and again in
1988, he‘s in a sense carving out
some space that has not existed,
and that some people contend still

One oi my concerns is that, when
people say “He cannot win," they
are not saying ”I’ve looked at his
positions and his qualifications,"
What they are really saying is
“he’s a black man 7 a black man
Can’t run ior president in the us.
and win," it can only be American
rejection or a black person as a
possible leader oi the country.

Scarlet and Black
What would Robert Bork's cone
firmation mean to racial politics?

Dr. Pindernughes

it he does have a sense oi the
Constitution in terms oi the
original intent oi the iounders and

Americans should turn in their
voter registration cards and return
to slavery The Constitution’s
original intent was not to allow the
black population to be part oi the
political system, that was very ex-
plicitly included. We can't rely on»
ly on what people said zoo years
ago its not that you throw it out,
but that you use it in ways that you
can trace historically.

Frank Goodkin, assistant pro-
iessor oi psychology, this week an-
nounced his resignation etiective
at the end oi the lands academic
year. He will leave Grinnell Col-
lege to become a health
psychologist at lowa Lutheran
Medical Center in Des Moines.

Contrary to those oi some other
taculty members who have leit
Grinnell, Goodkin’s reasons have
nothing to do with any dissatisiac
tion with the college. He com-
mented that he would have been
happy no matter what choice he
made. “I’m happy with the deci-
sion 1 made, but i would have also
been happy it I‘d decided to stay
here,“ he said. The job Goodkin
will take at Iowa Lutheran deals
with pain and stress management
in patients with physical pro»
blems. “Basically, the position oi.
lered me is tailorrmade tor my in
tel‘ests,” he said, adding that
“they oirer services there that are
not oiiered at any other hospital in
the world.”

Although he will be leavmg the
college, Goodkin said that he would
“certainly like to keep some air

Goodkin, who came to Grinnell
in 1983, received his PhD. from
Brown University aiter completing
his undergraduate study at Colum-
bia University and his MA, at
Dalhousie University in Canada.
