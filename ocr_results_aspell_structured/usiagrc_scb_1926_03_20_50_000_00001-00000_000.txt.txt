The first part of the program was

Argue With Coe
On Prohibition

chhio llrro Thursday Night Shows
a Look- of Preparation.

The prohibition question was dis-
cussed in the open forum debate be-
tween Grillnell and Coe, held Thurs
day night in the A. R. H,

The Grinncll team composed of Rus-
Sell Smith, Lawrence Pedcrson and
Frank Dewey supported the negative
of the l'll'oposti‘tion, “Resolved: That
the Eighteenth Amendment should be
repealed.”

There was :1. direct clash of opionion
in the argument presented 'but the
debate was marked by a. lack of Dre-
Daration and understanding. Especial
ly was the lack of hnnyy’ledge appar-
ent in the Grinnell team which had
worked on the question but four
days.

The argument centered about the
question of state rights, Cue contend-
ing that prohobition should. be a. met<
tor for state legislation and not for
national. The Coe speakers also main—
tained that legislation against vice is
not possible and then went ahead to
show how prohibition had failed. The
Grinnell debaters took direct issue
with these arguments.

Appeal-ed with Many orchestras
in This Country.

The st. Louis Symphony orchestra
with Rudolph Ganz directing, will ap-
pear in a recital in Herrick chapel
next Tuesday night at eight o'clock.

The orchestra has just completed its
19254926 “Home Season" at St. Louis
and is now on its spring festival tour.
It is composed of about seventy-five
members and is accompanied by a
soloist, Kathryn Browne. Miss Browne
is a contralto and was formorly with
the Chicago Civic Opera company.

Rudolph Gang, director of the sym-
phony is ono of the leading musical
directors in the country. His iamo has
become international during the last
years and it can be said that he is
making musical history.

The Swiss musician began his study
of the idollnvcello and the pianoforte
when he was eight years old. His
first concert appearance was as a
'cellist, but his later success as a
pianist led him to specialize on this
instrument. He studied at Strass~
bourg with noted teachers and with
Blisoni u Berlin. it was with the
Berlin Philharmonic orchestra that he
established himself as a pianist, Lat—
er he taught for five years as the dean
of the musical department of the Chi—
cago Musical college.

in 1906 Mr. Gang made his New
York debut under Felix “Veingctrter
with the New York Symphony. His
next twelve years were spent in con-
certizing in Europe and America. In
1921 he was invited to lead the St.
Louls Symphony orchestra as one of
its “guest" conductors, and the im—
presslon made resulted in his being
engaged as a permanent conductor of
the orchestra

Mr. Ganz basicd the New York
Philharmonic orchestra, the Los An-
geles Symphony orchestra, and has
had solo engagements with the Min-
neapolis and Detroit orchestras. He
has composed more than two hundred
songs and many piano compositions.

The program follows:

Brown Derby, Insured For
$5,000, Placed On Display

Many guesses were made this morc
ning when curious onlookers stopped
in front of Childs Art Rooms and saw
the Famous Brown Derby that will
soon adorn the brow of some illustri-
ous Grihuellian. Who the lucky [let-
sou will be who will receive this
coveted award is 'the question in many
minds. True it is that the recipient
will be that senior who gets the best
grades with the least amount of trou-
ble. Many men have been suggested
as possibilities of being tho fortunate
one, but no one at present seems to
have any edge in the compotition.

Competition for the other awards
does not seem to be quite so keen
for their are outstanding men in each
class. The winner of the Lily or the
dumbest man in school, is already
known but his name will not he di-
vulged until a later date. There are
two out standing candidates for the
Leather Medal which is given to the
man who is proclaimed the most
brilliant masculinity on the campus.
The two into who are at proscnt out-
standing in the rivalry for this award
are both Phi Beta Kappas or should

“The Quest of the Firehird," the
ballet which is to be presented by a1
cost of sixty college women is an im- l
portant part of the program of the‘
Physical Education demonstration
which takes place Saturday, March 27,
in the men’s gymnasium.

The story of the bullet is a simpli-
fied version of the ballet the “Flrc~
bird" which in turn is based upon a-
Russian legend. The curtain rises 11!)-
on the scene of a, ball on the Prince‘s
birthday, The King, jesters, nobler
men and nobiewomen are present and
peasants and nobility vic in dances to
entertain the Royalty and bring them

forth accomplishing the dilf’iculf. task
of bringing back the feathers of thel
Firebird, will win her hand. The
Princes draw lots to see in which dir-
ection each will search, then all de-
part.

Act Three is in a far and strange
country. One Prince [mils frogs, any
other swans, another waterliylnphs,
but the last one finds the Fircbird.
As he is about to shoot her she begs
for her life and so charms him that he
spares her, and mvaits his chance to

wicked enclldntment (lll'ollngh‘t about

heart. But one brings the much priz—

and was enthusiastically received.

Much Work Required

The music is beautiful, the cos—

hard work involved in the presenta-

In regards to the guests ‘to the Sig-

added that those who have been asked,
compose the most outstanding group
of men ever to ho asked to a Grinnell
College function. Men from all parts
of the state are on the invitation list
and have signified their intention of
being present when the curtain raises.
Men who are of state Wide prominence

Bond Salesman Gives
Club Practical Tips

.lorgrnson Tells husrncss Club What
is Expected or Good slilcsmcn.

llii'. Jol‘genson, of the National City
Bonding Company oi New York, gave
members of the Business club some
practical advice about bond selling in
his tall: in Smith hall Thursd y
night,

“A familiarity with the lows of in
’Ves‘lment is imperative if you are to
advance to a responsible executive
position," he said, although he
stressed the point that a man with
the knack of selling and little know—
ledge would get farther than the man
with knowledge and no selling knock.

Ill l\[r. Jorgenson’s opinion, the
three points to be considered in en-
tering the bond some are: service re-
quired, knowledge necessary, and re-
muneration. He advised any person
or firm from holding bonds to buy
equally good rails, public utilities,
sound home industries. and foreign

industries.
In closing he stated that ii young

nlﬂl‘l must be careful in picking his
house because lie has to build up a
satisfied personal clientele. To be a
success he must like the game for the
game itself.

TICKET SALE SUCCESSFUL

Will Determine Proposed hood
Trip Planned by Club.

The sole of tickets for tonight's Dra-
matic club production, "Outward '
Bound," while proving slowly at the
first of the week, has picked up dur-
ing the last two days, and according
to the publicity committee late today,
only a few of the choice seats are
left

The cast has been busy putting the
finishing touches on the production
the last few days, with dress re-
hearsals last night and today. Last
minute changes in the cast have add-
ed to the work, but nearly all of the
members of the club cast have had
considerable oxpericnce in amateur
drumntics, and Will be able to fill
their assignments in the _required
manner.

Theater Class in Charge

Members of the Experimental Thea—
tel' class have been employed all week
in arranging the sets and the lighting

'iil the High School auditorium where

tile play is to be held The entire pro-
ductloli wiih‘the exception of the act-
ual direction will ho in charge of the
members of the class. ,

Jerome Hughes, who was assigned
to the part originally cast for Emil
i-lilharz, while not himself a member
of the Dramatic club, has had consid—
arable experience in amateur acting,
and is expected to fill the role in an
acceptable manner. The remainder
of the cast are members of the Club,
and with the possible oxccption cf
Draper Long, who is to play the part
of Rev. William Duke, all have ap-
peared in various amatour dramatic
productions at Grinnell.

May Make Tour
0n the reception of the play by a
college and town audience tonight will
depend the proposed road trip plan~
ned hy the cast for the spring vaca-
tlon week. The contemplated trip is
more extensive than any ever plan-
nod by the club, and will include Fort
Dodge, Des Moines, and several other
iowa Cities if undertaken. In event
it is decided to take the tour, David
McCornack, now in charge of the pub—
licity, will manage the trip.

The play is one of the most difficult
us well its the most thrilling ever at-
tempted by the club. The ccrio ab-
mosphere of the whole play and the
unnatural situation in which the
characters find themselves. add to the
thrill and have been largely respon—
slblc for making it a. popular play
wherever presented.

This is probably the farthest west
that "Outward Bound" has ever been
produced either by it professional or
amateur Cast, and the Grinllell Dra-
matic club is one of the first organiza—
tions to obtain the amateur rights.
