College relations director
William Deminoll expressed
pleasure with the new ranking He
said he believed the survey was
objective and iactual and appeared
in a cieditible enough magazine to

future literature and hopefully
would atrract students interested
In selence. he added in addition,
Deminofi though that the ranking
would cause graduate schools to
look more favorably at Grinnell
when reviewing applications

Cultural values

Hardy wrote that an institution’s
ranking was a reflection on
students, faculty and facilities to a
small degree and that the main
reflection was on the Cultural
values of the institution. He listed
seven value conﬂicts that be
associated with the production
level of scientists and scholars.

These conilicts were: personal
dedication versus a sense at in-
direction; antitraditionalism
versus traditionalism; concern for
the near future versus concern for
the present and distant future;

beliei in the dignity oi man versus
belief in the helplessness of man;
high valuation oi learning versus
suspicion oi learning; equality
versus group dominance; and
iiaturalism versus superr
naturalism.
Production levels

Ilardy wrote that the stronger
the influence of the former values,
the higher the level of production,
Thus, schools with high rankings
exhibit many or all of the former
values, schools with low rankings
have all or many at the latter
values, and schools with medillm
rankings have either a blend or a
combination of former and latter
values, according to Hardy.

Ilardy predicted that iuture
production levels of scientists and
scholars would diminish to the
extent that Current social
movements stressing the latter
vallles arc successful in
penetrating the highly productive
groups that now must,
