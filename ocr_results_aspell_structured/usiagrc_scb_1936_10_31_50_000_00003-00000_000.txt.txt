University of Texas
Students Battle
for Academic Liberty

AUSTIN, Taxi—(ASU)7Un
versity of Texas students are wag-
ing a battle for academic liberty
on two fronts.

They are carrying on a vigor-
ous campaign to force abandon-
ment of an edict providing for the
censorship of their newspaper,
“The Daily Texan.” simultaneous—
ly, they are meeting the challenge
of superpatrioteers who are seek-
ing to paint the university "red"
and shirt off all progressive opin-
ion.

The censorship ban was imposed
by the Board of Regents during
the summer, barring all discussion
or "national, state and local polith
cal questions" from the editorial
columns and subjecting other ma—
terial to administrative scrutiny.

In the midst of their statewide
campaign against the ban, the stu—
dents discovered that a legislative
"investigation" had been launched,
with an organization known as
the “Progressive Democrats," the
main target of the inquiry.

After two days of the inquisi—
tion, the legislators were divided.
Half of them believed the “demo-
crats" were fascists. The other
half believed they were “Commu-
nists.”

the
bewil-

"We’re just democrats,"
students repeated to the
dered snoopcrs.

The probe is still going on.

Veterans of Future Wars
Joke Ended by‘ Founders

PRINCETON, N. J—(ASUJ’
Without warning to, their meme

of the “Veterans of Future Wars"
have abruptly revoked the charters
of 500 at their local posts and an»
nounced that the organization is
dead—at least for the present.

Its office, located on the Prince-
ton campus, is closing.

The project, launched last year
as an anti—bonus satire, spread
swiftly throughout the nation. It
steadily became less anti-bonus
and more antlrwar, however, an
emphasis which apparently dis—
turbed the national commanders.
Many v. F. W. posts took part in
the peace strike last April, despite
the silence of the commanders on
that issue.

The joke is over, say the nation-
al commanders.
