Volleyball Team Prepares

. for Conference Tourney

By Julie Kaster

On Saturday, Oct. 21, thePioncers
traveled to the St. Olaf Invitational,
and the competition was cenainly
challenging: St. Olaf College, Car-
leton College and Dr, Martin Luther
College from Minnesota.

Grinnell’s first loss was roSL Olaf
by scores of 4-15 and 3715.

Next, Dr. Martin Luther College
defeated Grinnell 6715 and 3—15.

In the third match, against Carle-
ton College, the Pioneers began
playing well but were unable to play
a solid allraround match. The ﬁnal
was 11~15 and 4-15.

Grinnell then received the oppor-
tunity to avenge their loss to Carle-
ton as they were matched up in the
consolation round. Unfortunately,
the Pioneers had already been worn
down.

“We had simply played too many
games before the tournament," said
Coach Sheila Cain of the team’s
hectic fall break.

“I will never schedule that many
games in a row again. it is just too
much,“ she said.

Grinnell next faced lowaWesleyan
College on Thursday, OCL 26, 10s
ing three straight, 5-15,6—15, and 8-
15.Duetoinjuries,thePioneers were
forced to manipulate their linerup,
putting some inexperienced players
in key positions.

Middle hitters Beth Prullage,
Susan Egbert and Jocelyn Keough
were unable to play, allowing re-
serve Maude Logsdon to see some
varsity action.

In contrast, the lowa Wesleyan
hitters showed immense improve-
ment over their previous perform-

ance against Grinnell.

The Pioneers were also at a height
disadvantage widi the loss of the
middle hitters. Another factor was
Grinnell‘s inconsistent serving
which discouraged the players.

“We needed everyone serving well
because it is mentally difficult to
stay up when hardrfought volleys
are won and then a player serves the
ball into the net," Coach Cain said.

Grinnell dropped its final match
of the regular season to Illinois Col-
lege last Saturday in close games of
11715, 11-15 and 6—15.

Grinnell jumped out to a 6-0 lead
in game one, but because of their
lack of unity, the team met with
defeat.

In the other games, Grinnell suf-
fered from a pattern of mediocre
play.

Grinnell did have some outstand-
ing individual performances by
middle hitterSusan Egbert, who had
23 blocks and 6 kills, and freshman
hitter I ulie Korver, who replaced
Beth Prullage and blockcd consis-

ently in each game.

Setter-hitterKathy Kritz hads kills
and defensive specialist Courtney
Wells had Grinnell's only ace serve.

Although Grinnell's serving per
centage improved to 85 percent, the

 

team failed to convert on many cru-
cial serves.

The MidwestConferenceTouma-
ment is Friday and Saturday, Nov. 3
and 4, at Illinois College.

“We have been preparing for this
tournament since August and we
know if we play together and com-
municate we can win some games
and move up in the rankings," said
setter-hitter Amy Robinson.

Skull Crushers and Purple R008
Race in Full Force at Wartburg

By Gerald I-Ionigstock
and Katherine Fairbanks

More than 40 Grinnell runners set
out Saturday morning to run the
Wartburg Invitational.

The Roos fielded the entire team
for the first time since the Les Duke
Invite. Twenty»one strong, they set
out to challenge themselves on the
rolling hills and a SOD-yard “killer"
straightaway finish.

Faced with a stiff breeze, times
were slower than expected, even
though many of the runners had
tapered for this “"peak meet.

Having prepared, in some cases,
four years for this race, the runners
who were not on the varsity squad
were determined to have a good
showing. Senior coecaptain Eben
Erhard ran a tough race, but was
botheredbyasorehamstring.Senior
Pete lnselcompleted hisseason with
one of his best effons, whilejunior
Mike Jennings, finishing his last
season due to a 3-2 engineering
program, unfortunately did not have
a spectacular race.

Seniors John Elmore and Dome
inador Gobaleza were unable to
travel with the team, but offered
much moral support.

Once again, a Grinnell pack came
together and Nathan Cook, who had
a big personal record, was helped
alongbyAliAkgun.JaredSchettler,
John Marciari, Brett Kelver andDan
Johnson.

Honigstock for most of the race, and

extremely large offensive line, kept
the ball on the ground for much of
the game.

yards, Monmouth exploded for 299
yards using more than six running
backs

Monmouth rushed for four touch»
downs prior to halftime, while hold-

the second half, with a one—yard
touchdown run by quaterback Dave
White. After the successful extra-
point kick by J ay Ludlam, the score
was 28-7 in favor of Monmouth.

touchdown before the close of the
thirdquarter to further lengthen their
lead.

In the fourth quarter, fullback
Shannon Gocke added Grinnell’s

second and final touchdown, mak-
ing the score 35-14.

But Monmouth tacked on 7 more
points before the final gun sounded,
ending the game.

To make matters worse, Grinnell
lost Starting tightend Corey Jones to
an injured shoulder.

committed no tumovers for the sec»
ond consecutive game.

The day marked the return of Pat
Heller, whohasbeen outwith noless
than three stress fractures; he ran a
fantastic race and earned a place for
himself on the varsity squad.

A hard weekoftraining showed in
many of the varsity runners. Despite
the grueling week of training, Chris
Garman set his own personal record
and placed 15th, one spot ahead of
Jonathan Lave. Close behind were
DavidShet‘idan,213l: Jason Maples,
Nick Hopley and Mark Couch, all of
whom are improvingataquickpace.

eight complete teams,

The whole women’s team — with
few, if any, sick or injured, or vice
ttmsof academic stressorof missing
the bus — journeyed to Wartburg
for a 1m shot at nrnning their best
times of the season and making the
conference squad. For some it was a
personal success # one of those
meets to be remembered as the prime
of youth; but forothers itwas one to
be drowned in a keg at the Gardner
lounge Halloween party.

Among the happy finishers at
Wartburg was senior Heather
Lauver, who finally had art asthma—

and growing having died or drowned
in the past week, Freshman Kara
