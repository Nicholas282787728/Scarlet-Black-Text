Pink panther prowls
this weekend

by Nancy Carpenter

PeterSellers is it very funny man
and nowhere are his talents more
evident than in The Pink Panther.
This is the film in which Sellers and
director Blake Edwards created
the role oi Inspector Clouseau oi
the Paris police force, the in-
veterate bungler who could turn a
jaywalking oiiense into a major
riot

Sellers himself described the
character as ”a man oi grave
dignity who is uniortunately ace
cidentrprone.“ One critic
suggested that both Clouseau's
dignity and pathological awkr
\vardness stem from a chronic
inability to see beyond the glaze
over his eyeballs.

Sellers has help from a solid
supporting cast. David Niven is the
epitome oi greasy suavity lit's a
word—we looked it up) as a
sophisticated jewelrthief. Robert
Wagner plays Niven’s eager
nephew. who becomes a thiei just
to impress his uncle. Capucine is
Mrs. Clouseau, saddled with her
clumsy_ mate, and Claudia Car-
dinale plays the obligatory sexy
rich woman. As for the plot, it's a
tangle of slapstick and satire
through which the intrepid in-
spector stalks his man, mildly
hindered by a couple oi gorilla
suits, some runaway cars, and a
fabulous gem. But the plot‘s not
important in this film; inspector
Clouseau Can’t be bothered by
mundane details like plots. He's an
original .comic ore ' n and the
strength or The Pink Panther
derives directly from his antics.

I’ve been dawdling over The
Pink Panther so I wouldn't have to
think about The President‘s
Analyst. The situation is akin to
reviewinga luscious dessert before
. reviewing the nasty. 91d spinach,
except that "The ’Pr‘esident's
Analyst doesn’t even have
vitamins to recommend it. James
Coburn wanders through the film,
looking Strangely like one oi the
Schlock Festival’s “living dead.”
He plays the president’s analyst, a
man who becomes so overwhelmed
by the magnitude of the top secrets
divulged to him, that he flees in
desperation, pursued by enemy

 

agents and u S. security it's a
very funny idea for a movie, so
it's really too bad that it was so
royally botched Critic Brendan
Gill Wrote, “, . . the film loses
control oi itseli, pitching headlong
into greater and greater
exaggeration. Through the way it’s
been told, a tale that should have
held us spellbound instead dwinr
dles into a mere outrageous joke.”

The film nolr series draws to a
Close this week with the showing of
The File on Thelma .Iol'dnn.
Devotees of film noir won't be too
surprised ii i say that the movie
deals with the treacherous nature
oi a woman in an ugly, seamy
world. Barbara Stanwyck, who
established herself forever as a
iilm noir vamp in Double In-
demnity. plays the lead. directed
by one of Hollywood's German
imports, Robert Siodmak.

To Die in Madrid is a part of the
Western European Series.
Directed by Frederic Rosif, the
film is a dramatized account of the
Spanish Civil War, made with
(outage shot during the war.

with housing choices that “aren't
better than those that have already
been drawn." She said she is

_ presently “more concerned with

having enough room ior fresh-
men,”

Atypical room draw behavior
patterns contributed to_the housing
limbo this year: Green Crim cited
the popularity oi newly renovated
Clark Hall. “Seniors drew doubles
in Clark as opposed to singles
elsewhere " More upperclassmen
drew into onerroom doubles and
into triples than usual, Also,
students avoided dorms, that are
going to be renovated riei’t't year,
especially Main Hall, which will be
evacuated in the early fall, But the
major diiierence, stressed Green
Crim, was the increased number of
next year’s sophomores who
were drawing alone .

“Housing is tightxj‘she admitted,
but Green Crim expects rooms to
open up as students waiting to hear

there are always a few students

won’t return to claim their rooms

LUCKY number 373 was drawn

by freshman Ted Castanes, who
was seeded thirdrtonast in room
drawf "My own littletspaeelis all I
want," he lamented. “What really
gets me is that they're not assuring
anybody oi anything. After they
coax you in here with all their
propaganda, they dump you." said
Castanes. Who had visions of
-organizing a protest against‘the
housing system and "getting
people to wear little yellow houses
pinned to their collars.”

Another roomless victim of the
draw, ireshman Mary Ann Hatton,
said, “You‘d thin that after
.everyone had ‘paidi'their‘r l‘iity
dollars they would know how many
students they have This isn't the
iirst time they‘ve had room drawi

they should know how to run it by
now.”

She described the situation as “a
general mess,H But Hatton looks at
the bright side. “Look at it this
way, now there's a chancel Won't
be in Norris. At least this way I
have a chance at a good room"

OTHERS. like Hutton, are also
anticipating playing the odds in
drawing a room and roommate,
Erik Burcrofi Sees it as ”more of
an adventure this way Most people
would be turned off by a freshman
ora transfer roommate but it’s fine
