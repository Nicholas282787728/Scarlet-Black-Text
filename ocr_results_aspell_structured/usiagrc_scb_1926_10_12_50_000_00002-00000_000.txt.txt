Ls SELF-GOVERNMENT TO BE TAKEN Shillousnl'l
People in high places are constantly paying tribute
_ to Grinnell's sclfrgov‘el'nment, but these folks either have
attained uncanny wisdoni by contemplation of real things

' near at hand, or are so far removed from the active scene
of battle that they never come in contact with the petty
side or student scltrgovel‘nmelit,

Suppose we, those most directly concerned, got over
curiosity about lengths or “campus,”
and how man~ victims the League hoard calls Why not
spend at least part oi that energy trying to discover why

our all»ooiisuini

scllrgavernmeui. works, and how it can hc’iinprovcd?
Do the men care how the League hoard functions, as to
ram, license, purpose, or does thei interest border upon
curiosity? Is the student council a figlll'eJmild or does it
mean something to some of usl
it really .is a shame that some people have to collie
to an institution where rules flourish; hut for their very
bencllt, the rules exist. Consﬁtutio/lis and bylaws and
rules are only means to an end, aud’zlccordlng to several
which are road at regular intervals, that end is to “PTO-v
mote scholarly activity and provide a happy lite
students." it is just as serious as it sounds, and a little
honest probing intoself—government affairs by both stu-
‘dents and faculty would make the various organizations on
_ the campus brought together for the purpose, less open
to polite ridicule.

WHY IS c\ CRI’I‘I‘Z'.l
The. Hindu professor who was here last week will
he remembered for e wh' e, at least by those who were
‘ present at the Vesper service on Sunday. l-lis chanted
prayer was found most interesting, and although ' did

for,

not dare approach him on the subject, he has doubtless

nior, ,iirp . d than pleased at the spontaneity of our
chuckles.
Why did we laugh" is it because we have no fear of
('l‘lllclsm or contradiction or are we Just iiitolcriiiit and
skeptical iii the presence of (OllVlCLlons which are not
our own? The least we can do is to keep our minds
upon enough to consider the possible virtues in another
way oi thinking

Supercilious intoler ice is, too oi'lcii,

only pitiful ignorance lll disguise.

Whether we believe in mysticism and the power of
prayer or arc allicis s by prelcrencc, we have little right
to boot at auo'llier's beliefs, even when the boots are sui-
i’iciciitly , bducd so as not to make the chapel ring with
ilicir i-cberbcratious

runes to do more than merely listen in a lociur or :iii

are given in high school, The individual is permitted
to exercise his own initiative in developing the dssigi‘r,

are required ‘lo do some constructive thinking.

it you wish to progress under this new system, you 'tpxicatipg name,-

deserves, you must reserve some time for that sub-’

wish to receive real benefit, you will endeavor to do the

work so that you will know it is wcll done and not in tmm

The grading in many subjects is necessarily more
subjective tliau objective. However, do not blame the
instructor for the grade you receive. No one is pre-
indiced against you or your work. it you get a low
grade, you undoubtedly deserve it, You may feel that
:i comparison with the work and grade or apother justle
fies your discontent in the inattor. However, you will
tiii'd that you are not competent to judge. Tlle way to
increase your scholarship is not in criticism or the one
who correct the work, but it is in criticism oE'the one

you will experience no difficulty in your collcgc career.

Start right, R'eshmen. In your iirst year you will
