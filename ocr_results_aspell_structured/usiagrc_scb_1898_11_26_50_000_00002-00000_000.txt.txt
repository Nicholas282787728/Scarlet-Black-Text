The football team desires to ex
press its thanks to the Griniiell
students and friends who worked
so faithfully to get the grounds at
Des Moinesin shape tor the game.
It is the same spirit ot sacriﬁce
and loyalty that has so long
characterized the students here.

THE GREAT Thanksgiving Day
game is a thing of the past, and
Grinnell has met with her ﬁrst de-
feat of the season. As to the
game itself, there is no excuse to
be made. Both teams played the
best football of which they were
capable, and the better team, un
der the conditions, won, On olhr
er grounds, however, complaint
can be made, and with justice,
Aiter last Monday's snowstorm,
the Grinnell management at once
suggested that steps be taken to
clear the ﬁeld of the ice and snow
which was upon it. The Drake
management cheerinlly acquir
esced and proceeded to clear off
the snow, so that when represen-
tatives oi Grinnell arrived in Des
Moines, Wednesday evening, they
round the ground one sheet oi ice.
They at once went to wprk and
spent the greater part of the night
and most of the next morning en»
deavoring to put the Field in prep
er condition. In this they were
ably assisted by the advice of the
Drake representative, who arrived
on the ﬁeld late in the morning
when the work was all done. 'As
a last resort it was decided to put
sawdust on the ﬁeld, which was
done just heiorc the game and be»
tween halves, but no Drake man
raised his hand to help, and every

bit oi work was done by the visit»

ors from Grinnell.

standpoint of the visiting team,
this method of procedure seems
unsportsmanlike, to say the least.
We make no charges, but conclw
sions seem to be ohvious, espeCr
ially when the weight ot the Drake
team is taken into consideration.
Moreover, it would seem that it
would have been more straight-
iorviard and more becoming a
team which Clalms the collegiate
championship otsixstates,tohave

openly signed the certiﬁcate of
amateur eligibility which all the
leading college teams of the state
have agreed upon adopting, in
stead of evading the question in
every possible way Here, again.
we make no charges, but would
simply like to state this one fact.
The team representing Drake Uni-
versity has won many victories
and acquired a great reputation
this fall. but nevertheless Drake
can never assume the place which
she ought to hold as a leztder in
athletics. in the best sense of the
word, until she has openlystepped
out and cleared away even the sus-
picion ot protessionalism which
her methods in the last few years
have brought upon her.
