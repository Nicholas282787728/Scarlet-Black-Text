Blue] ay Dual
Next Varsity
Track Event

Graf Will Bring 20 Men
for Contest Here
Saturday

With one dual meet victory and a
creditable performance at the Drake
relays already tucked under their-
belts, the Grtunell Pioneers will meet

noon in the annual track and field
meet between these two schools. The
dual will he rim off in conjunction
with the annual Grinnoll Interschol-
astic meet which is being held Sat-
llrday.

Many meet records shoultl go down
under the onslaught of a number of
track stars who have already this
year turned in better marks in nine
of the events on the program. Creighr
ton strength will lie in the hurdle
races, the short dashes, and the field
events, in which Grinncll is weak,

Records Due to Full

Lanyon, Bluejay sophomore hurd—
ier, may erase both hurdle records
from the books, since he won his
varsity letter last year in the annual
telegraphic meet, under a special pro
vision made by Coach Lon Graf of
the Creighton team.

The Atoryard, the 880-yard, the
mile, and two-mile marks should all
he bettercd Saturday providing the
weather is right. Captain Thomas
has an excellent Chance to lower the
quarter-mile record of :52 sct by
Reed of Creighton in 1929. Dick Mui»
phy holds the present half-mile rec—
ord, but he is almost certain to run
the distance under two minutes,
which would clip four seconds off
the old mark.

Pilhrow Should Better Mark

Err-captain McIlrath of the 1931
squad holds the mile record, but at
present Coach Duke has three men
on the squad who can do better than
4:37, the old mark. Myron Pilhrow,
after his brilliant performance at
the Drake relays, in which he ran
second to the Indians star, Brock~
smith, should knock 15 or 20 seconds
oft the time of 9:53 which he set last
year.

The Grinnell milerrelay quartet,
which ranks with the best in the
country after its performance in the
Drake relays, should do better than
3:28.23 in that event, since it has not
failed to better that mark so far in
competition this year.

Derby to G0
at Razz Fest

Fourth Annual Sport Dance
Planned for Saturday

”Judging by the number of tick-
ets already sold to both local and out
of town guests, indications are that
the limit of 130 tickets, will soon he
sold," said James Morrison, chairmen
of the committee preparing for the
fourth annual Brown Derby Drag, to
be held Saturday.

Speaking for the committee, Mr.
Morrison said, “Because of the large
number of students from neighboring
schools who are taking advantage of
the opportunity to hear Carl Moore
and his band in person, we advise
Grinncll students who expect to at-
tend the dance to reserve their ticks
ets early.”

AS the night of the annual ”razz—
fest" approaches, the question, “Who
will get the Brown Derby and who
will get the Brown Bonnett?” has
become n campus topic.

There have been three dcrbics
awarded since the first “Drag" in
192s. “Skike” Hunter won it that
year. “Ernie” McIntire, former Pio—
ncer grid star, annexed the prizc in
1930, and last year, “Chuck" Dclong,
star swimmer and magazine Sales»
man, was selected, as the “Grinnell
man who got by the biggest, with
the least amount of effort.”

Committee members have been bee
singed with queries as to who will
win the honors, but have refused to
divulge any information to anyone,
including other members of the 1m»
ternity.

Chaperones for the dance will in-
clude Prof. and Mrs, Earl D. Strong,
Mr. and Mrs. L. V. Phelps, Prof. and
Mrs. J. w. Charlton, Mr. and Mrs.
Grant 0. Gale, Mr. and Mrs. J. c.
Truesdale, Mr. and Mrs. G. Lester
Duke, Mr. and Mrs. L. L. watt, Her-
schcl M. Colbert, Dean Shelton L.
Beatty, Dean Luella J. Read, and
