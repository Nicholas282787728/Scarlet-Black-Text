Tm Morello of Rage Against the
Machine went to Harvard. Sonic
Youth: Kim Gordon attended the
University of Michigan. Phil
Goudreau goes to Grinnell.

“We’re all pretty shy," said
Goudreau of his Gods Reflex
bandmaies, Soaring through its ﬁfth
year of existence, the
band plans to tour
this spring in promo
tion of their latest
album, A BriefLes'r
son in Affection.

A minute later,
though, Goudreau
insisted that “we try
not to dink around."
indeed, If anything,
Gods Reﬂex proves
in concert that they
are serious about
their music. With
wellrcoordinated.
complex precision
guitars layered on
top of a nailrbiting
momentum, the
band members cerr
tainly maintain a
c o n s t a n t
connnection with
one another.

Still, what kind of
image does Gods Reﬂex have?
Given the lyrics and album design,
the band appears sort of quiet and
somber. But in concert, that make
up would not describe the band what-
soever. Goudreau‘s energized, posi-
tive tricks are canceled out by lead
guitarist Marcus’s metalish growls.
At the same time, aitight-lipped Jesse
calculates his drumming exactly
while bassist Zach sways with a
drawlish bass.

Despite the somewhat opposi-
tional personalities of the band mem-
bers, though, they all share two
things in common: each member is
propelled by the sound of the band,
and all four play in perfect unison.

Goudreau seems aware of the
“driven" altitude the members share

inconcert: Goudreau commented on. .

how many bands simply put ouiCDs,
without hardly touring at all. He
added that playing live is “the only
lun thing I do".

Reﬂex Present

Goudreau, a sophomore, col
founded Gods Reﬂex roughly five
years ago with Zach and Jesse. The
band has been “serious” for about
two and a half years, though, in
which time they have released two

seven inches, a full-length album,
andacompilation track, Signed wirh
Johanns Face Records, the band is
already plotting out theirnext album:

“We want to do a more concep-
tual sort of thing 2m overreaching
idea less three chords and whin~
ing," Goudrcau remarked.

Zach, also a sophomore, is the
“King of Angst," Goudreau cited,
though he adds a mufﬂed “whatever"
with a grin. Zach‘s the “sleeping,
crying, it’s-not-my-fault" type, said
Goudreau, while freshman Marcus
suggests a focus on guitar in the Re-
ﬂex sound. Freshman Jesse, who lisr
tens to Poison and the Foo Fighters,
“intricately patterns" his beats.
Gourdreau commented, creating an
overall solid drum sound. Goudreau
himself prefers the “dissonaiit”: “I
am less chordoricnled you know,
Ijust throw things together." All in
all, Goudreau believes the members
have “distinct musical leamings."

thorigliTGoudreau was absent fr m'

the band during some of that time.
Smiling broadly, Goudreau mentions
how the high school the members
attended want to feature the band for
Career Day, as well as play at the
school.

At the beginning, Gods Reﬂex
was a punk band. Arguably they
could still be considered so, but since
then they have evolved their sound
into a more “dynamic" one, accord-

ing to Goudreau. Although Gods
Reﬂex have managed to‘kcep their
songs at roughly the some length —
two or three minutes — they are look-
ing for a more “elaborate" sound in
the future.

Live, the bzmd prefers playing 30,
40 minute sets. Goudrcau added that

likes to ﬁnish before people start fil-
ing out, as well as keep the energy
level high. Most importantly, the
hand does not like playing the same
material. Goudreau admits that all
the members become bored after
playing the some songs enough
times.

After the band became estab»
lished, they soon realized that their
support in Rockford was rather slim.
With that, they turned their sights to
the Chicago area; consequently, they
played their debut album release
show at the Metro in mid-January
with Sidekick Kato.

Among the band’s other memo-
rable performances are shows in

sult of the CD being released in 107

the band's performance in those
places. Otherwise, Goudreau re‘
grels, touring with a small name has
been rather difficult.

Nevertheless the band's discog»

From East to West:

Delayed by illness, Indian
performers finally ready to begin.

BY RYAN OLSEN
Staff Writer

On Tuesday, March IO at 8:00
pm. in the Forum South Lounge the
second scheduled performance of
Indian Classical Music will take
place. entitled “The Art ofihe Indian
Voice, Recital II: The Carnatic
(Soulh Indian) Tradition." Lalitha
Krishnan performs vocals, Madurai
Gnanasundaram the violin, and
Ganapathy Raman plays the
mridangam.

The violin is used to reinforce the
melody in composed sections ofperv
formances, while the mridangam is
known as the classical hand drum of
South India,

This performance is the second in
a two-part series which was sup-
posed to begin last Sunday, March
1. Unfortunately, that performance
was abruptly canceled, due to the fact
that the feature performer had fallen
ill.

“We will try to reschedule her for
later in the semesier,” stated Roger
Vetter of the Music Department.

The main Objeclive of these two
performances is to bring the ﬂavor
of non»Westem music to the Grinnell
campus. The South Indian style of
music to be performed on Mar. 10
“has its origins in Hindu temples,“
as Vetter explained; “it still retains a
lot of devotional character." in con-
trast to the Nonh Indian style,

“The evening’s program will very
likely feature performances of kriti,

the principle form ofCarnatic (South
Indian) Vocal music," as the program
published for the performance de—
scribed. Continuing on, the program
explains that ”krill are Hindu devo—
tional songs that in earlier limes were
performed primarily in temples and
courts but have come to be, in this
century, the featured items on cone
cert programs."

Krishnan, the featured vocalist,
has performed extensively in the
United States as well as abroad.
Gnanasundaram has been perform-
ing since his teenage years and has
performed with many distinguished
vocalists, as well as instrumentalists.
Roman, the third member ofthe trio,
has played the mridangam since age
9, and has also done a great deal of
work abroad as well as in his home
country of india.

Prior lo their performance here at
Grinnell. these three will perform on
Sunday at the University of Iowa.
Arriving here Monday evening, they
will give lheir concert and then leave
early on Wednesday. An organization
known as the Indian Non-Profit Clas-
sical Music Association, based in
Maryland, which sponsors Indian
music performers and helps them
come to and tour the United Slates,
has helped make it possible for these
performers to Visit lhe campus.

Students are encouraged to come
and witness llils unique presentation
ofnon-Western devotional music,

two songs with Phil Bonnet.
Goudreau likens Bonnel’s recording
style to Steve Alblni’s.

Over Thanksgiving the band re-
leased their second 7", one they
shared With The Rodmans, This
time, the band paid about $400 to
release one song. After that, the band
recorded their first album, A Brief
Lesson in AﬂeciionoffJohanns Face
Records. After printing 1500 cop-
ies, the band has sold roughly half
thus far. Moore Darn distributors
sent about 400 copies to record
stores, while the band have sold ap
proximately 400 copies themselves,

‘ Generally, Goudreau
houses a few doubts
about the label, but not
many. He pointed out
that the promotion the
label performs in often
rimes subpar, but then
added that is due to their
limircd funds. Gods Ree
flex, likewise, does not
ma a genuine proﬁt:
any earned wages are
used to record new ma»
terial or to buy new
equipment.

Reﬂex Future

Tonight, Gods Reﬂex
plays in Dibble with the
Adobe Zweig Band at
10:00, This interesting
punk-funk contrast
should attract many

And although many
of the band‘s upcoming
performances look ten-
tative, the band’s performance to-
night kicks off a lengthy tour. The
band will play some lowa and South
Dakota shows before Goudreau
leaves Grinnell on Wednesday for
some Illinois appearances. This
summer, the band hopes to arrange
an even more extended [our sched-
ule.

After spring break, the band plans
to tackle another album, one which
Goudreau wants out fast. Also loom-
ing in the near future is another 7“,
this time a split with Austin's The Tie
Thai Binds.

The band is working on a news
letter now, too. Gods Reﬂex can be
contacted over email, and hopefully
their web site will be completed.
soon.

Goudreauhopes that Gods Reﬂex
wiii- be reknow'n someday'as a su-
perb live band. Indeed, although the
band does do well on record, their
technical sound could be furthered
by more expensive, professionalized
recording equipment. Thus, per—
forming live is what the band seems
to be most fruitful at doing at this
stage. In a time when many rock crit-
ics are saying that the live perfor»
mance is dead, Gods Reﬂex rises
above with a youthful, energetic
kick,

Saturday Night Feverlllll
Directed by John Bodhom.
Starring John Travolta and 0
bunch of other disco miscre—

unis.

You know John Travolta is a Mr.
Cool bad-ass type from the opening
credits, which lost about 20 minutes,
They focus on him walking down the
street, occasionally usrng the proven
method of hitting on “chicks" by
getting in lheir way as they are walk—
ing down the sidewalk minding their
own business. Surprisingly, this does
not work, and we get to spend the
rest of the movie watching John's
friends score in his car while he and
his other friends watch, Just like
Griiinell's disco.

Before I am savagely beaten to

death, let me point out that those two
stars all come from John’s extreme
suaviry. and the nifty disco gear
sported by everybody. The story is
really dull, and almost none of it
takes place in an actual disco (217
though a lot takes place preparing for
discos). So, the exciting scenes are
great, and Travolta is funny, but the
2 hours of the movie where he is be-
ing repressed are dull.

Here’s a fun thing to do during this
movie: Get all your friends together
and sneak booze into Harris. (Ignore
them when they say there is to be no
smoking or drinking alcoholic bev-
erages during the movie: they have
lo say that). Everytime there is 2 ar»
cheiypal disco something or other on
the screen, everybody has to drink.
The results may surprise you.

critically acclaimed movie from a

A bunch of people get naked, have

Harpist
Chenette
performs
pieces from
Near East,
British Isles

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Jeanmarie Chenette will present
a faculty recital on Friday, March 6
at 7 PM. in Herrick Chapel,
Chenette, playing the harp, will be
assisted on two pieces by ﬂutist
Rebecca Stuhr.

Aptly titled “Dances with Harps,"
the recital will feature Chenetre per-
forming several dance sets. The
songs vary in origin from the Near
East to South America to the British
Isles. Among the songs she will per-
form are “Oriental Dance,"
“Villaviceneio,” and several Celtic
dances.

Chenette's recital will diverge
from the conventional recital due to
these different works. She describes
the recital pieces as “going beyond
the limits of a classical training."
Chenette will perform only one song
which may be considered traditional
concert repetoirer

The varying origin of the pieces
require Chenette to play four differ-
ent harps during the recital: a nylon
lever harp, a Paraguayan harp. a wire
strung lever harp, and a traditional
pedal harp.

The pieces vary not only on their
area of origin, but also in their time
period of origin, While some are tra-
ditional folk songs, Chenette will
also play a work composed in 1996,

Chenette will play a set of Celtic
dances with Rebecca Stuhr. Chenette
arranged the harp accompaniment
for these traditional Celtic melodies.
The dances included are reels, jigs.
slipjigs, and hornpipes.

“Enlrata,” composed in 1996 by
modern composer Katherine Hoover,
proved to be an interesting ﬁnd. A
piece for harp and flute, Chenette de-
scribed it as “A realjoy to playmthere
are very few pieces to choose from
i‘n‘[the living 'womeii coin ”
genre." 1 ‘ ‘

Both Chenette and Stuhr started
their musical training early, Stuhr
beginning ﬂute in the ﬁrst grade, and
Chenette receiving signiﬁcant musi<
cal education before starting the harp
at the age of 14. “

Chenette continued [0 play the
harp, eventually receiving a Masters
in Music Performance in harp at the
New England Conservatory. Before
coming to Grinnell, she performed
with various orchestras,

In studying harps around the
world she said, “I‘ve become a stu-
dent again with world harps."

Stuhr said that she continues to

- play because “It’s very fulﬁlling. . .a

lot of work, but satisfying." She
plays with “Basically Baroque,“ an
ensemble centered in Ames consist-
ing of oboe, harpsichord, cello, and
ﬂute.

Chenette loves the opportunities
that music provides: “Music is like
an open door. It rakes you so many
places...History and the world be-
come right at your ﬁngertips."
