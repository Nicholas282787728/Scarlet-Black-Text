lost two top athletes to graduation

Also, a larger core group of athletes
trained on their own this fall so the
rerurners should be better.”

Coach Freeman has a few
holes In his lineup, namely in
the throws and short sprints.

the best I have had in recent years
and I expect them to be in content
