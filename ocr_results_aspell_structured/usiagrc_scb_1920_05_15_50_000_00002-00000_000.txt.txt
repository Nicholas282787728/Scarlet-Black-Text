One of the marks oi true Culture is

an appreciation for good music. A

highly technical knowledge is not

necessary, but by taking sdvantnge or

was opportunities to hear

quired which will be a real asset.

Grinnell prides herself on being one
01‘ the musical centers of Iowa and
there is no doubt or the ‘high standard
attained in her musical activities. Not
only are our own organizations oi ﬁrst
class, but we secure artists or rank
for our recital course each year.

The May Festival is always the
crowning event of the year‘s musical
sin-actions. This year is especially
signiﬁcant, as it marks the return to
pie—war status in the appearance of
a large symphony orchestra—the ﬁrst
in three years. The orchestra secured‘
is one or the few ﬁrst class organizse
Lions of its kind in the country and.
assures an excellent program.

The opportuniues to hear a group
oi musicians, such as the Mlnneapollsl
Symphony Orchestra includes, are rare
even in large cities and a. small com~
munity like Gi‘inneli is fortunate in
securing an engagement. To hear the ,
masterpieces of the musical world ade—
quately rendered by capable artists is.
an opportunity which should not be!
missed.

Thirty years ago this store supplied most of the meagre
shoe needs of the student body. This long standing and

possibly than ever before. The Ross Shoe Co. and Grin—
nell College have grown and p1 ospei ed together. As the
College has given to the country many splendid men and

cgcns honest meichandise, bought and sold on a truthful
