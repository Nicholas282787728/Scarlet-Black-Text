A no. kind of Christmas spirit was evi—
dent this week. It was the spirit shown
by a hooded mob and drunken disrespect for
authority. It was the spirit of those who
used their clippers and their bottles in—
stea of their brainsa

Those masked boys who crowded into a
room in South Younker and clipped off a
boy‘s hair because he was ”different" are
not innocent college pranhsters. They com—
mitted a malicious and pre—meditatod act of
Violence. Supposedly, they nought they
would be saving the ”good nane” of their
collefe by their actions. This is a stupid

ationalization for a thinly veiled confor—
prejudice. The students involved in
this act did more harm to the name of Erin-
nell than did the single boy the does not
wear his hair "just so.”

It is up to the CofHP and the Dean of
Men to punish those individuals so that an
example may be set.

And then there was the Boar's Head din—
uer......

Perhaps there was not enough respected
ruthority at the head table, per rs the
tradition has grown stale or perhaps it was
osca Be certain groups encouraged members
oi t r hall into forgetting where they
VFPe 'just for another laugh.” More likely
it was a case of acute adolescence. A good
p.rt of the Boar’s head dinner was handled
in very poor taste(not so much the toasts,
not the accompanying jeers from the back—
ground, and the generally obnoxious conduct
of g few). It is not so much viat should be
done ii ut the participants in the shanani—
gens a .hat should be done about future
Boar‘s Heads tint We are interested in, that
is the job of tue good Dean of Men and his
cohorts. What does disturb us is the fact
that students, in another example of follow
the leader, are at once urinating into milk
‘,asses and tryi g to bring about more self-
, Vernmcnt. How, we ask, can a decent self-
governing system come out of the Constitu—
tional convention, when men do not even know

rs not to be children? A member of the

culty Was heard to say, ”If they continue
to act stupidly, and can‘t handle themselves
thc faculty and administration will have to
do it for them."

This is not what we want; hut how can
we fight for self—government? how can we
nave faith in the students themselves when
they continue to act in the childishly ir—
responsible manner in which they conducted
t cmsglvss at the Boar‘s Head dinner and
' South Ynunker this Week.
