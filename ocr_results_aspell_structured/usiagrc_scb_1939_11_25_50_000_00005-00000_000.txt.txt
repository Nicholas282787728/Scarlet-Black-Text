Mermen Practice
Marathon Swim
In Serial Form

To swim from Davenport to
Grinnell by Christmas is the goal
set by the Grinnell varsity swun-
ming team.

At present the marathon swim-

mel'men past Iowa City. The total

makes each day in practice is
lumped together, and the distance
marked off on a map oi lowa.
stiiatt Parks, varsity coach, has
estimated that in three years time
the total number of miles covered
by swimming teams in the Mid—
west conference alone would reach
from here to Huang-chow, China,
or at least the square root of the
total miles from here to tho moon,
or Mal'sior somewhere.

Anyway, ere Yuletide, the Grin»
nell swimmers will have crossed
halt the state of Iowa.

Members of the squad who are
reporting regularly are: Carl Ate
kins, captain, distance; Malcolm
Jensen, backstroke; Robert Jens
sen, backstroke; Barton Nagata,
dashes; Richard Runge, distance
sivi ; John Sarbaugh, distance;
Dudley Conner, breast-stroke;
Darrel Caris, distance; Edward
Carqueville, dashes; and Jack
