ulii'versity eleven made a name tor

Grinncll, that it could dereat such a
team,

The dccisivcncss ol the score re-
moved all douht as to the superiority
of the two teams. Luelt is an 0167
ment in every (netball game. Last
year all the hreolts secured to he

real the division was more even.

hlaclt eleven was in line tor a state
championship that eleven is the one

we must win every conteicnce game

We lime a real g me on our hands
