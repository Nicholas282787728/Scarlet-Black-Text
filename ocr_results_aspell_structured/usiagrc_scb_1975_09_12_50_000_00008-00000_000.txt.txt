The Grinnell Scarlet and Black, September .12, 1975—pr B

Gridders braced ‘for‘grind

By Tom Arenberg

Whenever a football team starts
training for a new season, certain
things can be expected. There will
be pulled muscles, missed blocks
and players losing jobs, There will
be new plays to learn, weight
programs and impressive fresh
men. But there is something more
characteristic of training than any
of these. It is optimism.

Grinnell is no exception, And
why not? The Pioneers have a new
stadium, a small turn over from
last season and the largest player
turnout in many years, They have
also kicked the losing habit
somewhat, by recording three
victories last year and coming
close in two others. In 1973, they
lost all nine games.

Offense was the team’s top asset
last year and will probably be
again this year. Using the air and
the ground about equally, the
Pioneers averaged twentyrthree
points per game. Several players
who played offense have been
switched to defense, but this might

be offset by not having to use as .

many freshmen starters. Last year
there were seven freshmen start-
ing on offense, but this year there
are none. .

l"

The unit is led by quarterback
Paul Crane, who won the starting
job as a freshman last year and set
the Grinnell record for most
passing yardage in one game.
Head Coach Edd Bowers, who has
been a coach at Grinnell for 16
years, said Crane might be the best
quarterback in the Midwest
Conference, Crane is a threat to
run as well as pass, but the most
prolific source of yardage is senior
fullback Tom Goetz.

Guetz, who is a tri-captain, put
his name in the school record book
last year by rushing for 1,022
yards, including 225 in one game,
which is another record. He is the
only Grinnellian ever to have a
“four-digit season” on the ground.
His partners in the backfield are
Mikel-lopkins, who showed good
moves returning kicks last year,
and Mark Bowman, who is adept at
springing Goetz loose with jarring
blocks. Mark Schultz will also
figure prominently in the backfield
when horecovers from a recent
arm injury. Senior Brian Martin
will probably take a lot of handoffs
as well.

Last year, receivers Paul
Delaney and Dave Wopat spent
most of their time watching Crane

throw to all-conference end Jim
Casey. But now Casey is on the
sidelines as a coach and it is his
turn to watch Delaney and Wopat.
No one is certain what to expect
from the receivers as Delaney was
hurt for half of last year and Wopat
was mostly a blocker

But the offense will not score
twenty-three points all year, much
less each game. if the offensive line
does not open any holes and does
not give Crane enough time to at
least dump the ball off somewhere.
The tackles are Doug Cummings
and Paul Matecki and the guards

‘ are tri-captain Dennis Walters and

Steve McNamara, Matecki and
McNamara played on the line last
year, whereas Cummings and
Walters switched from defense,
The hiking will be done by junior
Ron Runser,

Scoring twenty-three points per
game is usually enough to win
more than just three games, but
the inexperienced Pioneer defense
did not hold the opposition'very
,well, In the conference, they
finished next to last iii points
scored against and opposition
yardage. But this year, the players
have more experience and unr
doubtedly, more confidence.
Coaches Ron Mitchell and Mo Hunt
have worked to build a new spirit,
one which was understandably
damaged last year by teams
recording scores of 54, 52, and 40
points against the Pioneers.

Grinnell was the most generous
of all conference teams on the
ground last season. Trying to do
better this year are ends Bob Grant
and Mark Blanchard and tackle
Lorne Robinson, The other tackle
is the third trircaptain, Scott
rackrcll, who moved from offense.
Steve Bolesta, a freshman and one
of the biggest players on the team,
will also get a chance to knock
heads at an end spot. The middle
guard is senior Mike Nadalsky,
another player who converted
from offense.

Behind the linemen are
linebackers John Hamby and
freshman Charlie Gogel along with
a secondary of Hosea Engram, Jim
Fallac’é, Mike Harris and either
freshman Brian Shearer or
Bowman, if he switches from
runningback once Schultz returns.
The lanky Harris and Engram
cover‘ed receivers last season and
Fallape is big enough and fast
enough to give fits to opposition
receivers,

Bowers said the player turnouti
besides giving him a uniform
shortage—has enabled him to
make two complete units on both
offense and defense. This means
that few, if any, players will play
on offense and then switch to
defense when the offense gives up
the ball. Thus, the players will be
able to rest between ball
possessions,

lie also said he was satisfied with
the progress of the defensive unit
so far, but added that the offense
“has not yet jelled.” But he Said he
thought the unit would be ready for
the team’s first test of the season.

And some test that will be. The
Pioneers will take on the league
champion Cue Kohawks tomorrow
at Coe, The Kohawks were un-
defeated in league play last season
and had the top offciisc and
defense, They Started last year by
smashing Grinnell, 54-21. But
considering that One allowed only
nine points per gainc, the Pioneers
did rather well And most people
bclicve they will do rather well this
year against Gas and against all
the teams they will play.

All in all it was a day to cheer for
Grinnellians as the women were on
top of their game, But, lest you
forget, this is nothing new in the
history of women’s tennis
Grinnell. Coach Wack points out
that last year the women were the
winningest fall team on campus
(’til the last soccer game), and this
season there is no reason to expect
anything else, The attitude of team
members is very high and the
women we spoke to were, without
exception, optimistic,

Soccer set ,
for Cornell“

by DaveSchechter

An optimistic Grinnell soccer
team opens its season tomorrow
afternoon with a home contest
against Cornell.

A scrimmage last Saturday
provided Coach John Pfitsch with
the information needed to form his
starting lineup. About the

it was good to learn where our
strengths and weaknesses r..”
Pfitsch commented that meg
pleased with the play of rese
goalie Jim Freeman, forward Pete
St. Thomas, and halfback Rich
Fendler.

Starting in goal tomorrow will a
Gary Frumkin. In front of him at

Eichengreen, and tri-captain Mark
Schwartz. Fendler, Wade Lee, and
trircaptain John Lom will start in
the halfback position, The front
line will include St. Thomas, tri-
captain Pete Shearer, Mark
Bailey, and Dave l-loopes. ‘

One worry for Pfitsch this 13 st
week must have been the phySlcal
ailments of several starters.
Bailey, Lom, Eichengreen, and
Frumkin sustained minor inju 'es
but all returned to practice edit
middle of the week.
