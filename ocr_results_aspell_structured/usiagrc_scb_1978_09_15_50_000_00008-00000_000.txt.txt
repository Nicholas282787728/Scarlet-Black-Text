l
and leaves ’em laughing

by Nancy Gould

and John Strauss
For Second City, life is a per»
formance “The thing about
Second City for actors is the style
oi acting. All oi it springs out oi
some kind of truth, or some kind of
experience or emotion," relates

John McKee, one of the cast
members

Second City’s dependence on life
Situations for their routines was
reflected by John and tile rest of
the Second City touring company,
backstage between shows last-
Saturday evening. The cast was

easygoing and talkative, throwing
out provocative and humorous
commentsisome in themselves
possible lines for Second City
improvisations

SANDY DAVENPORT began the
discussion of Second City and
improvisation, but iirst joked
about the impending toga party
that evening and the merits of
North Side Chicago humor on an
audience like Grinnell. John
McKee. ,Lance Kensley and Ron
Dean joined later while Colleen
Falmey yelled choice remarks
irom her dressing room, Joe
Moore, the last member of the
troupe, kept a low proiile vying
instead for Pizza Hut and a cold
drink. The company began by
discussing their material and how
they go about obtaining it.

  
  
  
   
  
    
    
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  

SANDY EXPLAINED that
although they receive their
rmaterial irom the resident

company in Chicago, they also
improvise their own scenes and
change the original scenes to
reﬂect their personal moods. It is
this immediacy that Lance ilnds so
enjoyable: “It’s the only theatrical
form I‘ve ever been involved in
where you can experience
something during the day and
come in and put it on stage that
evening."

An examnle of this im»
provisational style is the scene in

The Reverend from
the Church of

Caucasians in Lake
Forest sings the

gospel to his
congregation:
“I’m rich . . .
and I’m proud. ”

which a social worker “helps" a
man about to attempt suicide. The
social worker uses . trite
psychological techniques to keep
the man irom jumping off a ledge
His exaggerated mannerisms are
a hilarious parody oi the business
of pop psychology. Lance admits
that the act is an exaggeration,but
a truthful one. “People recognize
this type oi thing,” he remarks,
obviously amused with the scene.

THE sllow ALSO contains
impromptu skits provoked by the
audience, Acts such as those in
spired by me audience par»
ticipation last Saturday may
become Scenes for shows in the
luture “Everything stems out oi
improvisation—all the material,”
says Sandy, adding that any event
occurring on or oii the stage can be
incorporated into the show.

The touring life of Second City
can be hectic, and by the looks of
the exhausted actors (luring in
termission, very tiring. The group
travels about 17 days out oi the
month, usuallyreturningtoChicago

resident company has the day oii.

TOURING LEADS them to such
exotic and faraway places as
Miami,PittsburE)l, and San Franci-
sco, but they generally perform in
the Midwest. A lotof their humor is
based on Chicago and its suburbs,
ridiculing the foibles of each.
When traveling, the company must
therefore adapt its humor to iit its
location and audience.

The members oi the company all
. agreethat a college audience is the
best type to periorm for, Sandy
feels that studentS'accept the
material readily~especially skits
such as the sexuality talk, in which
she irankly addresses the females
in the audience on deception in the
boudoir. She feels this type of
material is too explicit [or a less
liberal audience.

BOTH RON AND John Moore
view audiences in a more
humorous vein. “i like old people.
They don’tlaugh so much and they
don’t interrupt!” Ron says while
John sarcastically quips, “The
kind of audience I really like is a
paying audience.”

Regardless of the audience.
whether it’s a large campus, a
dinner theatre or a business
convention, the frantic pace of the
troupe‘s show could tire a well~
tuned athlete. “When you’re
preparing ior a real heavy month,
it can get very exhausting,” Sandy
says. “You‘re putting a lot of
energy into producing a good show
and you’re on the road traveling. I
mean we're not all fagged out but it
takes a lot or energy" But, she
adds, “lt's iuliilling to expend that
energy,"

l JOHN FEELS THAT traveling
and periorming is physical, but
enjoyable nonetheless. “It’s about

 

donning a toga for the festivities.
He was last seen chasing a co-ed
through the South campus loggia,
commenting that his toga might be
ruining his chances Di capturing a
maiden. The other cast members
seemed content to mingle with
students and enjoy the festivities.

Just how does one get started in
Second City? For almost all the
actors it meant studying imr
provisatiunal theatre in Chicago
with one oi two experts in this
field: Del Close or Joe Forsberg,
After the workshops " you yusr keep
auditioning ior Second City hoping
you make it,” said John Some, like
Lance, began acting in college and
“kept acting and got into Second
City through that." Actors and
actresses in Second City have
come from all walks of life. Some
have been teachers, advertising
executives, and one was a Chicago
policeman.

THE FUTURE FOR these
talented actors is bright if their
predecessors are any indication.
“Second City virtually populates
commercial comedy," Sandy
stated, Besides the long list of
famous alumni, which includes
such actors and comedians as Joan
Rivers, Peter Boyle, Alan Arkin.
Alan Alda, Shecky Greene, Elaine
May. Mike Nichols and David
Steinberg, Second City can boast of
directors and television writers.
The head writers for Fernwood 2

Second City members also find
unique ways to amuse themselves
while on tour, The group en-
iertaiiied the Grinnell campus
early in the evening, but students
reclprocated that night at the zills
campus toga party. (Coinciden-

from the movie Animal House.
