An ITS satire

The mocnr considerarions ofrcmoying scvcral computer labs has
forced rhc uc corps to rry to identify locations inro which the labs
may be moved instead ofoomplercly closing rhcm.

ﬁxarion on mandarory laprops, a orbal seems to have formed, intcnr
on thccliminarion ofpuhliccompurer lahs, despite the consequences.
The siudcnr.rrrn uc corps opposes the elimination of public comc
puler labs as it worries that having only around 20 computers for the
appmxlmalely 300400 srudci-irs wirlrour personal compureis could
potentially trigger a crisis during ﬁnals rimc when mosr ofrhe 300.
400 students will haye to write papers forclasses.

The uc Corps has had only limited success in ﬁnding new loca.
tions in iu arrcmpr ro try co lcccp a decenr numhcr ofpuhlic computt
crs available to srudcms. ”Our ﬁrsr idca was to rcconsrrircr Polish
House and put some computers in it," reporrs paul Hcidcr '04, who
will head thc UC corps next year, “bur there were some problcms
with that idca. Thc laclc of elccrriciry was one major problem. but a
larger problem was thc disranoe from many ofrhe dorms. We want a
location that is easy to got to from rhc dorms." lr was this desire to
ﬁnd a centralized locuion on campus for rhc dorms that led the uc
corps ro ﬁnd its most promising locaiion

“It seems ro inecr our needs qiiirc well," said Kcnslcr “It's fairly
spacious and it has clccrriciry and oven air condirioning. paul Hcidcr
and l hayc bum on scvcral informal walking tours ofrhc area, around
124 pm. and also around 10:30cll pan. and have found the space
ro bc lirrleused during much orrhar time."

At a public meeting on Tuesday, Heidcr was aslccd what Bill ancls
should do about losing his ofﬁce. “I would suggcsr thar hc bring a
tent to campus and sct is up on Mac Field,” he said.

Respect cultural
differences

Dear Editor:

This rs in rcfcrcncc to rho arriclc “Facrng the Raging Cow" in ihc
May 3, 2002 edition ofrhc 5&3. Whilcl am not opposed to the idea
of she Raging Cow tournament, is is somewhat disrurbmg for me
when an image ofa cow being spcarcd appears on a campus newspa»
pcr.

To mc, rho cow rcprcscnrs life and the sustenance of lifc. The
sacrcdness of rho cow is conrrai and crucial element in my beliefs. To
see a cow being speared on we can be seen ro he sacrilegious to the
animal,

Grinncll College's ahiliry ro respecr and accept indiyidual differ-
ences has a dramaric impacr on rhe quality oflife for all ofus hero on
campus. such difrorcnccs hayc added to the oualiry imeresr and rhc
value orour lwcs. I hope rhar the my will continue to inform, educ
care, and among other things pmmolc srrcccss in diyeisrry, and foster
immial respect for indwrdual dirrcrcnccs and beliefs,

l hope rhar 3w: will be :iwam of ihcsc crrlrural differences in the
farms,

l wanted to thanlc all ofyoii pcisonally for the seriousness with
which the allegations brought against paul Ford were addressed by
this past week's 5&3. Scxual misconduct is an issue which, when
addrcsscd, ofren rcﬁccrs cnrorionahry, irrationality, and defensiveness.
I was pleased and relicvcd to see the 56-8 reporting intelligently and
with inrcgriry, and hope this lucid and lust representation of rhcsc
allcgaiions will shape rhc reactions so and ricarmcnt ofyictin-is and

SAWG support

We, thc sexual Assault Working Group, would llk: to supporr
rhc suryiyors involved in the rcccm scxual misconduct allegations
against paul Ford. We would like to recognize both rhc sunriyors rhat
camc forward and any rlrar chose nor to. SAWG stands behind all of
your decisrons and actions during those particular moments, now
and in the future. SAWG talccs it upon itselfro commend son for
their efforts in the removal ofFord as studcnr body presidcnr. We arc
disappointed thar ford chose not to aoccpr responsibiliry for his :cc
rions, and instead resorrod ro victim blaming; ir dom not “take rwo
ro rango." lr is especially saddening that a communiry leader he
hayod in this way. We trust the leadership and applaud rhe courage of
Presidcnt Rosenberg, and recognlu rhar he, his cabinet and others
inyolyed made the righr decisions. sexual misconduct is often ad—
dressed inappropriarely, but the response to this situation is a step in
me right direction for Grinncll College.
