Weather Report: New Sounds In Jazz

by Scott Mason

Weather Report has beeli the sub
ject of one of tile most intensive
publicity campaignsever-undertaken
by Columbia Record Company. Full

her Reportalbunis inevitably leatiire
stickers reminding you of the rec
Cord's status ill the latest Downbeat
Ci-i c‘s P011, or that Frank Zappa
thinks the disc is "excellent and/
or beautiful " Both Weather Report
albums--Weather Report and i Sing
the Body Electricerhave been re-
viewed at least once in almostevery
conceivable rock/jazz publication.

All oi Columbia's hype has not been
without reason, however. The nu—
cleus ot Weather Report is composed
of three of the most respected muse
lctdns the new wave of Jazz has
produced. Josef Zawinul, on a vare
iety of electric and acoustic key-
hoards, spent some years with can-
nonball Adderly, where he composed
“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" (all Chice
agoans who remember the old BUCkA
ihghams doing their version of this
tune raise their hand), Zawinul was
also responsible for two songs, “In
A Silent Way" and “Pharoah’s
Dance” that were recorded byMiles
Davis With Herbie Hancock,
Zawinul was among the first to make
extensive use oi the electric piano
in jazz. Wayne Shorter, on soprano
and tenor saxophones, spent time
with Miles in the famous quintet
of the early Sixties. In addition,
he has made a number of solo at-
bums that vary in quality, but ex-
hibit a definite progression towards
the electronic avante—garde in jazz.
Shorter's work on soprano, especi-
ally, has influenced many players,
Czech bassist Miroslav Vitous Com-
bines astounding technique with a
willingness to experiment ivith elr
ectronics, an unusual quality among
jazz bass players, The first album
features Alphonse Mouzon on drums
and the amazing Airto Moreira on
percussion, who were replaced on
the second record by Eric Gravitt
and Dom Um Ramao,

With distinguished musicians such
as these, one would not expect Wear
ther Report to produceanything less
than first-Class music What they
have chosen to do, in fact, is ate
tempt to develop music that might
best be termed electronic collecr
tive improvisation. Weather Report
has dispensed with many things that
are a traditional part of jazz: the
head, or melody, fixed chord
changes, steady rhythm, and ordered
solos. Most of their compositions
are centered around a theme, from
which they let a kind of collective
playing develop. Zawinul character-

. ises this concept by saying, “We

always solo and we never solo."
No single instrument is ever
intended as the dominating voice,
though each player is iree to Cone
tribute to the Overall development
of the piece whenever he chooses.
The result of such freedom could
mean chaos in the hands of lesser
musicians, butWeatherReportman»
ages to maintain an airy, almost
ethereal atmosphere due to the sup-
erlative playing qualities of Zav
winul, Shorter, and Vitous.

Weather Report oiten manages to
come on better conceptually than in
actual practice, however, as is
shown on their first album In ttielr
eiiort to preserve their impression»
istic calm, they olten underplay, it
such a thing is possible. Manyofthe
compositions on the WeatherReport
album sound very much alike: the
drums and percussion alternating
between funkyrtype rhythmsand tree
from embellishment, Zawinulcon-
tributing spacy, extended chords on
the electric piano, Shorter and Vi-
tous conversing in briei, open lines.
One misses the fervour that was the
essence of the collective improvisar
tions of Ornette Coleman and John
Coltrane Even though Weather Ree
port is conceptually very different
from either of these artists, there
is a lack of intensity in the first al-
bum that does make thegroup suffer
in comparison,

With the release of I Sing TheBody
Electric, however. these problems
of very similar compositions and
lack of energy are partially solved
"but in unsatisiactory ways. Side
One of I Sing was recorded in the
studio, and makes greater use of
studio effects than does the first
album, Each of the four composi-
tions has a very distinct character;
however, they are more highly
structured than those of Weather
Report, and pitch involve additional
instrumentation and overdubbing
Side Two was recorded live in com
cert, and captures the high energy
level sustained by almost any live
performance. The pieces on this
side are highly impmVisatory in
nature, though the band does retain
an overall framework that is often
surprising in the tightness of its
rhythmic transitions and changes oi
mood, i Sing The Body Electric
is generally the more interesting oi
the two albums, though in places
it would seem to go against some oi
the original principles and purposes

oi the hand
Weather Report, like most of the
bands working within this area of
progressive, electiic inzn and rock
still has many problems to work
cut-~lii'ob1ems much like those de
scribed above. While much remains
to be done in the field at clectronic
music itscll, an essential part 0f
the development rests with the lis-
tellers Beiorc principles like those
described on the Weather Report
alhulnr-or, lci- that matter, de-
scribed by John Coltrane or even
Karlheiiiz Stockhausenncan be iully
realized, people must attune them
selves to new concepts oi sound,

beauty, organization, and develop»
ment, an attunement that only time
can bring about.

Where Are We Now?

by Gregg banner

it's all over and Nixon's the one.
Like after any other election, the
question to ask is What does it
all mean? What was decided? And
where are we going now?

We were given a “choice” in this
election, although a dubious one ior
sure, between a candidate represenr
ting the dank degenerate policies
oi the past 20 or so years and a
candidate pledging himseli to that
Iiialodious malignancy ~statlsm It
was against statism vis , vis
George McGovern that American
Voters Voted. It was statism that had
to he deteatcd, and it was soy-re-
soundingly

But our nation will not last much
longer if its best response to the
alleged ubiquitousness oi statism is
to rehallow the llalitosis we now live
under Called»a mixed economy A
man cannot live happily ii his only
goal is to avoid death, and a na-
tion, likewise, cannot prosper ii its
primary goal is to hold oil totalir
tarianism This election was a stay
of execution, but we won’t get many
more. Most of us are aware that
something is terribly wrong in our
nation, But what? NOW While the
country is wallowing undei'Mr. nix-
on's economic freezes, is the time
to act But how?

Every human association is based
on some sort oi agreement, which
is implemented by rules of conduct
Tile reason for this is to prevent
men from resorting to physical force
in case of disagreement, Agreement
does not necessarily mean common
purpose however. For example, if
you had an agreement with your
neighbor- that you wouldn't attack him
so long as he wouldn't attack you,
then so long as you each abide
by it you are free to go yollr own

Can Technology Recycle The Rockies?

Kilocalorics could express the ecoe
nomic status of the United States
lost as appropriately as does the
Gross National Product (over one
trillion dollars annually). Recently
President Nixon created an Energy
Board to serve as a single author
ity tor implementing energy
resource development programs.
These programs are going to re,
sult in ever increasing amounts of
waste because their methods are
increasingly incilicient. Garbage is
the ultimate economic product.

Oil shale development is one such
program. Currently, oil supplies
43% of our energy consumption and
oil from shale is to be a one mil-
lion barrel per day proposition by
1985, thus reducing dependence on
ioreign sources So far, the ex-
traction process, Much is not fully
researched, has been 1| financial
fiasco. The private developers are
welcoming the ledeial subsidy
According to the interior Depart-
ment, anv eiiViroiimentul damage

will be held to an "acceptable minim
mum“, meaning the iollowing. At
one million barrels per day output,
enough spent shale would be gener»
ated in a year to cover Washington
D.C. six feet deep. The plan calls
ior dumping the waste, which has 12%
greater volume than the original ma—
terial, into hox Canyons The enorr
mous watei- diversion required
would create high salinity in the
Colorado River, Situated in a region
subject to air inversions, the entire
process would produce up to eight
tons of residual sulfer, 29 tons of
nitrous oxide, and K10 tons of dust
per day, The Environmental Im»

oi-auc open pit operation “would pro-
vide a Scenic vista which could inr
crease tourist tlafftc."

ironically, a bittcrcontroversy has
arisen between the oil shale develr
ppm and a group of corporations
that are experimenting with the re
lease of trapped natural gas by
under-ground nuclear explosions
Each side charges that the other will

Now, at a time when America is
rapidly approaching rebellion onone
hand and chronic apathy on the other,
it‘s imperative that we answerthese
questions, if we even hope to see
a solution.

Today our nation is Ci‘udly similar
to the Greek City state However,
since the entire nation can”! be con»
vened to a monthly or veai'lymeetr
ing as in Greece. the people are
compressed into groups represent»
ing various interests and the gov-
ernnient, acting in the role of chief
arbiter and ruler, hears their cone
llicting demands and enforces those
it deems representative Oftlte “pubr
liC interest." These groups aren't
electcd and anyone is tree to join
or form one to sllout demands for
anything.

So there‘s a business lobby, and a
labor lobby. There’s a group deg
manning “seiiioi-ecitizens rights”

which means “free” food, house
ing, medical care, etc, and a group
Calling itself the “Farm lobby”,
There are groups clamoring ior bet-
ter schools, better roads, censor,
ship of movies, and one for no can,
sorship of movies. Then there is
a group to forbid anyone to have more
than 2 Children, and another to tore
hid abortion and the use of contrar
ceptives, The list goes on but per
haps the iunniest group is the“wele
fare-recipient’s rights" group tie-
manding a guaranteed income of
36,500,

No, it's really not funny, but it is
the way things are What exactly
is dangerous about these special
interest groups, and what should
he done about them?
