“Could profs help unbog Burling bog-downs?

by John Mandel

Despite some student library per-
sonnel complaints that the Burling
hook Order process is inefficient,
Librarian oi the College Christopher
McKee and Acqusitlons Ulllcci' Scott
Schmidt disagree

hlost oi the chai gcs center on the
fact that because no written guidelines
l. ' which would force professors to
check Whether Burliiig has a book,
student personnel must spend a great
deal ol‘ tiine ehccking the card
catalogue, resulting in much wasted
time.

Schmidt agrees that approximately
30 percent of book orders are owned
by the library and that [or each 100
order cards s ~nt in, the stafl spends
3t; hours checking the card catalogue.
Duplicate book call numbers are noted
on the cards, which are then returned
to the professor, Although some
departments retain a secretary who
Ch ks ord s through Bul‘ling, this
percentage is low.

While Schmidt concedes a lot of his
department's time is wasted and Order
processing moves more slowly, he
liclieves the delay is unavoidable,

“It wollld be nice to have a stated

policy," he said, “but I think it’s ex-
pected that the library check order
cards lor the faculty "

McKee added that often new books
are ordered by dillercnt departments.
it they are on order but not in the
catalogue, professors cannot ascertain
whether the library really does have
the book. Thus. he added. ”it makes
more work but there is no way we
could expect anything different.”

Another area of concern for some
students is that book processing
moves too slowly. Schmidt aeknowiodg.
ed that throughout the year several
peak periods create a backlog of books
which slows down processing 0n the
average, he said, books arrive two to
six weeks alter they are ordered and
should be on the shelf in one to one
and a half weeks. It the need arises,
Burling processing may be completed
in only a low hours

At least part of the process has been
hastened through linkage with the
Ohio College Library Center Data
Bank, which uses a computer in the
basement to print catalogue cards and
spine tables. Because all the printing
is done in the building, the time sav-
ings at this step is enormous.

One interesting aspect of the order
process is the book allocation budget.
According to McKee, money is given
to departments by the Library Comr
mittee, which determines the dollar
amount at the beginning or the year,
based upon departmental need [or
books and their past allocations. Some
discretionary funds also exist.

The wide range in allocations is il- ,
lustrated by these examples for the
197930 school year: Physical Educa
tion 3100, Theatre 5500, Biology $5400,
and History 86500. What maV be
misleading is that the types at
volumes ordered by dilierent depart-
ments show great cost differences.

Even with the addition of many new
books each year, students continually
complain about the inadequacies of
the general collection. However, in
197071, said McKee, the library
bought 5,720 books and periodicals
with a budget or $60,000, Last year,
Burllng added 9,900 items at a cost of
$173,000. The attempt to build library
resources means a light to stay at
least even with inflation, said McKee.
Burling can reasonably expect to add
about 10,000 volumes per year to the
total current holdings tit approximates
iy 260,000 volumes,
