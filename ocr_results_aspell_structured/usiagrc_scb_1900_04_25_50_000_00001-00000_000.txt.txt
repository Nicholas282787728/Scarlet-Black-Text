Grinnell, 30; Western. 3.

The ball game last Saturday

atternoon between Iowa College
and Western College was decided
1y a walk over for the home team.
The visitors were weak at the bat
and their pitcher was hit often
and hard. The only features of
the game were a home run by
Stiger of \Nestein. and the double
play by Lindsay and Winsett in
the ninth inning. The Grinnell
team as a whole played well.
Fisk was missed from his old
position at short, biit did good
service behind the bat. The re—
turn of Taft to his old position as
catcher would strengthen the in-
ﬁeld by permitting Fisk to re-
turn to his usual place. The visr
itors made two scores on Stigcr’s
long hit in the ﬁrth inning and
one in the eighth.
In the second half of the ﬁrst,
Clmkc knocked a long ny be
tween loft and center ﬁeld, and see
cured three bases and scored on
Doc’s two base hit to left Field.
Doe stole third and scored on
Lindsay’s sacriﬁcc hit. Thompr
son secured a hit but went out on
Peterson's play to shortstop.

In the second inning, Fisk
caught )ohnson out on a foul, and
Trindle and Clark struck out. ‘In
the second half of the second,
Winsett ran around to third on a
long drive over right ﬁeld and
scored on Halscy’s hit. Fisk
scored Halsey with a two bagger
and camcin on Clark’s hit. Doc
went out on a bunt and Clark
scored on Lindsay’s hit.

In the third, the visitors manage
ed to get a man to second base,
but tailed to accomplish anything
further, while the Grinnell team
was also “white washed” in its
half.

In the fourth, the visitors failed
to reach ﬁrst. Th: home team
literally had things their own way
in this inning, making nine scores
and batting nearly twice around.

 

Inthc ﬁfth the visitors made
their ﬁrst scores. Clark made a
safe hit, Lensch struck out and
Stiger knocked a long ﬂy over
center ﬁeld which Peterson could
not reach, and Stigei and Clark
ran in. In Grinncll’s half, I’ctcrr
son, \Vinsett and Halsey scored.

inning and the IlliNl man failed
to leach ﬁrst. For Grinnell,
