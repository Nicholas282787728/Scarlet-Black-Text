Iowa College played her last root-
baller the season last Saturday with
the State College at dines, The score
was not so delightful a one toclose the
season with as that made in the linal
game last year against Simpson hut
conditions were very diilerent. Al-
though the score does not indicate it,
Gl'iunell closed the season almost as
triumphantly tlii. year as last. There
are t . ed opinions and sentiments
concerning Saturday‘s game but it
seems to be the popular opinion or all
disinterested parties ishc witnessed
the game, that the real score sliotild
have been 12 too instead or 2.3 to ii.
Indeed some critics iiould place the
score at o to (3, giving Ames still less
credit. AS to the matter or instice,
each one will have to settle that for
himself. Doubtless the ”Aggies”
count it as one in their iaior atitl con-
sider .ut they have shown Grinriell

it is a very notable iact that the anti-
cipated score or 100 to ti which Ames
early in the season boasted they would

CLASS BASKET BALL.

An Impormm Failure in Grinnell Athlet-
ics Now Drawrng Allention~5ched-
ulc of Games Announccd.

Alter the erection oi the Men‘s
Gymnasium in 1399 basket ball became
a popular sport in lowa College. The
simplicity and science or the game
and the l necessary to play it well,
appealed to Griiinell athletes and
though little known in the west at
that time it became an established
part or our athletic lire.

The gymnasium was completed too
late for thc lormation or a varsity
teanirlie til-st year, but class teams
were immediately organized and use»
ii oi games played, so class basket
ball is really an older institution at
Grinnell than the varsity game.

The lirstinterclass games were be
tween the {our college classes, three
games usually being played to deter.
minc the championship. With the
year will» however, a new system
was inaugu ted ulierebya series oi
teii games was necessary. The acade-
my was allowed to participate and
eachteam played with alltlie other
teams. A class basket ball banner
was mode and the class who won the
chain nsliip was to have its numer-
als put on it. P. E Seniors, ‘94, the
same year gave aciip which should
hear the numerals oi the winning
team and become the property or the
team which should v. illiiile right three
years in succession. Tl'c class or i'lDS
earned the honor the ﬁrst year aritl

much more satisfactory than the lirst.

The present season promises to be
an interesting and successful
