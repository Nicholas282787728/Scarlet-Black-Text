Singers, Chorus

Rehearse

Messiah,

Ready Russian
CD' Premiere

By Chris Doemel

The Grinnell Chorus and the
Grinnell Singers, under the direc-
tion oflohn Stuhr-Rommereim. are
currently preparing for two major
undenakings this school year, One
is the performance of the Messiah,-
the other is a compact disc record-
ing of a series of Russian pieces.

George Frideric Handel’s M es-
st'uhisadifficultpiece for any choir
to attempt.

“The challenge in this piece is
first and foremost the virtuosity of
the writing for the Voice," said
Stuhr-Rommercim. “TheMerriah
is one ofthe more difficult pieces to
perform because of the rapidity of
some of the passages. The chal-
lenge is simply singing all the
notes.”

To overcome the speed of the
passages, Stuhr-Rommereim has
developed several strategies for re-
hearsing the Messiah.

“What I’m trying to get them to
do is to have a lighter approach, to
make the text very clear, and not to
sing with a weighty tone," he said.
“l’m also trying to make the word
rhythms clear as they sing.“

Stuhr-Rommereim does not
doubt the choir’s ability to perform
the piece, however. “The more
they sing it." he said, “some of
these rapid passages become
easier."

Yet for all the difﬁculty of the
piece, it is one of the most popular
choral pieces in the musical world.

“it’s well known for a reason:
it's great music,and it‘sareal plea-

sure to sing. Handel knows how to
use a chorus to impress the listener
with powerful choral effects."

“This is a piece done by many
church choirs," said Stuhr-
Rommereim. “Almost every ch0-
ral singer has sung it.” In fact, the
frequency of the Merriah'r perfore
mance presents another challenge
for the chorus and director.

“So many people have done it
before that they are used to it being
done in a certain way." said Stuhr-
Rommereim. “So sometimes you
have to work against that,"

The piece also has several chal-
lenges for the director. Withachoir
whose members vary from the be-
ginning singer to the very accom
plished singer, Stuhr-Rommereim
ﬁnds it challenging to work “with
both of them at the same time.”

Another challenge for Stuhr-
Rommereim is the sheer length of
the piece.

“As theconductor, the challenge
for meis to learn afairly long score:
one that is longer than I’m used to.
The entire piece is at least three
hours long, and the portion that the
Chorus and Singers are doing is
going lobe abouttwo hours. That's
a lot of music to learn, but I’m
challenging myself to memorize it.
I’m hoping thatl can memorize it,"
joked Stuhr—Rommereirn, “but if
you go to the concert and there’s
music on the podium, you'll know
that I didn’t make it."

The assembled chonts for the
Messiah will be the largest that
Grinnell has had to accommodate

bers and,with theGrinnellSingers,
the chorus is about 150 members
strong.

“That's going to be another
challenge," said Stuhr-
Rommereim. “to try to work the
stage right so that there is room for
everybody, We really have to let
them sit down ; it’s such a long
piece."

admission fee that will be charged
for this performance

“We have to charge admission
to this concert," said Stuhr-
Rommereim, “Even though the
policy of the schoolis not to charge
admission, this concert is being
sponsoredhytheGrinnellAreaArts
Council. More importantly, it‘s
being funded by the Iowa Arts
Council, and they require you to
charge some admission. but we’ll
keep it about as low as we can."

The second project for the
Chorus and Singers is a recording
of Russian choral music on com-
pact disc. While the project is still
at an early stage of planning, Stuhr»
Rommereim believes that the re-
cording will be made in Herrick
Chapel in Apriland released before
the end of the school year.

The music that will be recorded
ispartofabodyof chomlmusic that
was written just before the Russian
Revolution, 3 period which Stuhrs
Rommereim describes as “a great
pinnacle both in performance and
in composition.”

“It’s a renaissance of choral

music during that time, During the
Soviet era, with the exception of
Rachmaninoff’s music, a lot ofthat
choral music has been forgotten.”

Among these composers is
Alexander Kastalsky, a man who
took ancient Russian chants and
harmonized them. The Chorus and
Singers will be performing a cone
solidation of works by Kastalsky.
Prior to the Russian choral renais-
sance,Russian church musictended
to be more imitative of Western
style and character.

“[Kastalsky] wrote in astylethat ‘

was more uniquely Russian, and
he‘s an interesting man in his own
right,” explained Stuhrr
Rommereim. “Before the revolu-
tion he was one of the more im-
ponant composers ofsacred choral
music,“

During the Revolution and for
the rest of his career, however,
Kastalsky ceased to write sacred
music.

“There'sabody of sacred music
before the revolution that is some
what neglected," said Stuhre
Rommereim,

Recently, the Russian Music
Societyhasbeenworkingtopublish
the collected works of these we
revolutionary, sacred choral com-
posers. Vladimir Morosan is pres-
ently working on publishing the
collective works of all of these
composers

Worthen's
Prints Display
Old Engraving
Techniques in
Burling Library

By Paul Midlcr

Featured in the Print and Draw-
ing Study Room of the Burling li-
brary is an exhibition by Amy
Worthen. The exhibit is a retro-
spective that displays her most
earliest sketches as well as her late
est prints.

Most interesting about the ex-
hibit are the prints and the engrave
ing plates from which these were
produced. Worthen is one of a
handful of artists today that prace
tices the SOOryearrold precise and
demanding art of metal plate en-
gmving.

During her visit to campus, she
claimed that some of the engravA
ings can take as long as four or five
months working ﬁve or six hours a
day. The process entails taking a
polished piece of metal plating,
usually copper, and painstakingly
etching the lines with a sharp
scraping tool. While other artists
such as painters have the option of
correcting mistakes, the engraver's
options to do so are rattler limited.
Oncea groove has been cut itcannot
be reﬁlled.

Printsoftheseengravings,some
along with their engraving plates,
are displayed in the exhibition. By
examining the plates one can grasp
just how particular and meticulous
the process is.

She incorporates themes that
have been played before among
anists. For instance, her Melan-
choll'rt II is an echo of Melanchulia
I, an engraving by Albrecht Durer,
one of the great—grandfathers of
engraving.

Much of her work resembles
that of an architect. She produces
many engravings of buildings,
homes, capitols and rooms. Archi-
tecture is quite an appropriate sub-
ject for engraving. The straight
lines often seen in architecture are
represented well through the me-
dium. Worthen uses these suaight
lines to give the architecture the
often forceful edge that architec-
tural rendition requires.

Wonhen also has a wide imagi-
nation. Her work is filled with
images from nature, literantre and
fantasy. In one Work, The Supreme
Cowl, she replaces the members
of the court with birds, ﬁsh, ro-
dents, rabbits, and griffins.

Some works border on the
morbid. Wild Duck Dinner fea-
tures a gathering. of ducks at a din-
ner table. Set before them isatttain
course of legs, This type of maca-
bre irony can be seen in many other
works as well. Much of the exhibit
is thoughtrprovoking and for those
unfamiliar with engraving, even
educational. Worthen's exhibit
will be shown in Burling library
basement through the end of this
month.
