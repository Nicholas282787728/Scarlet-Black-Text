Grinnell High School:
Survey Cites

Widespread Drug Use

By Justin Lincoln

Of last year's Grinnell High School
students. 85% had at one time or another
used alcohol. one-third had used tobacco,
one-fifth had used marijuana, and 10% had
used “other drugs”.

These ﬁgures appear In the recently
released results of a survey conducted by
Grinnell College professor Kent Mc»
Clelland and his “Methods of Empirical
Investigation" class last April.

The report “takes the form of answers to
eight key questions of interest to the Grinr
nell community," including the following:
extent of drug usage by students: dif-
ferences in rates of use for males/females
and for sophomores/juniors/seniors; come
parison of Grinnell students rates of use
with other lowa students; impact of
students' family 'situations on substance
use.

Of those using alcohol, more than half in-
dicated regular (at least once a month)
usage. Similarly, over 50% of tobacco
users say they use it on a regular basis.
Less than 10% of all students reported us-
ing marijuana regularly, and about 3 per-
cent say they used other durgs as often as
once a month.

“Results from our personal interviews
with a random sample of 52 GHS students
suggest that these ‘other drugs’ are most
often ‘speed’, although some use of cocaine
and harder drugs, such as LSD or heroin,"
the report cites.

Though males and females tend to use
alcohol in roughly equal numbers, males
are at least twice as likely to use other
substances, and use them regularly. The
largest differences are for tobacco use.
where 47 percent male usage is found,
compared to 19 percent for females.
However, the study does suggest that this

difference probably results from the
widespread popularity ofsmokeless tobac»
co among high school males in Iowa.

As for differences in usage among
sophomores, juniors. and seniors, it was
found that “seniors and juniors report
more use of alcohol and tobacco than do
sophomores, but rates of use of marijuana
and other drugs are about equal in the
three grades " In fact. use of marijuana
and other drugs among sophomores tends
to be slightly higher than for the other two
classes.

Correlations between substance usage
and family Situation were found as well,
The report cites the following, among
others: students living with both parents
are less likely to use substances of all
kinds than those who have other living ar-
rangements; students from small families
of one or fewer siblings are slightly more
likely to use marijuana and other drugs
than students from larger families;
students living outside me town of Grinnell
are less likely to use all substances except
tobacco.

The rates of substance use for GHS
students are somewhat higher than the
average rates for comparable students in
Iowa, as compared to a 1984 study ad-
ministered by the Iowa Department of
Public instruction. McClelland's report
states. “Most notably. Hie rates of use of
marijuana and other durgs among
sophomores at Grinnell are about double
the figures for Iowa 10th graders.”

With regard to the results, McClelland
cautions that “substance use is not
necessarily substance abuse,” adding that
“our information does not extend to how

Students Protest Aid;

Ex—Contra to Talk
on Campus

By May-lee Chai

Student protest marked the first day that
the $100 million us. aid package approved
by Congress earlier this year to aid the
Nicaragua contras was to go into effect.

Wednesday Oct. 1, the Grinnell College
Central American Support Group set up a
symbolic coffin to represent the war
deaths they foresee as resulting from the
ai that evening more than 200 students
joined with them in a “candlelight peace
vigil" on central campus.

The vigil was intended to “provide a

brief message, to let people know what
was happening that day, and hopefully,
spark some interest. Our display was more
emotional than informational," Meghan
Hays, a member of CASG, said.
The aid package was approved in a conti-
nuing effort by the U.S. government to
help the Nicaraguan contras, an alliance
of military rebels dedicated to overthrow»
ing the socialist government of Daniel
Ortega.

Hays, who lived and worked in
Nicaragua ' during the summer of 1985,

feels the people or Nicaragua do not ap»

prove of the Congressional aid to the con-
tras, '
“There was an overwhelming sense of

fear of the power of our Congress and‘our
country to wreak havoc in that country
[Nicaragua]. It was not a sense of anger
but more a sense approaching
helplessness. l was overwhelmed by that
sense,” Hays said of her stay in
Nicaragua.

“And this is so much more money and it
is an actual approval of the contra position
and the contra righting. . . I’m sure mat
feeling [of fear and helplessness] is even
greater now,” she said.

At the time of the protest the CASG had
about seven members, but several more
students have since joined and more were
expected to attend their Thursday night
meeting on Oct, 9.

The agenda for the year's activties has
not yet been set but the group plans to
make information available to the campus
concerning candidates’ views on the
Nicaraguan situation in time for the
general elections on Nov. 4.

Meanwhile. former contra leader Edgar
Chamorro will give a talk, “confessions of
a Contra: How the CIA Masterminds the
Contra lnsurgenoy,”‘ next Tuesday, Oct.
14, at 4:15 pm. in South Lounge as part of

Zirkle’s Death ,
Stuns Campus

By Maylee chai

Louis Glen Zirkle, Professor of Art, died
suddenly last Friday, Oct. 10. The cause of
death has not yet been determined as
autopsy reports have not been completed.
However, conversations with coroner Dr.
Robert Carney reveal that the “only seem-
ingly probable cause of death is a heart at-
tack."

The details of Zirkle's death add to the
tragedy of this event that stunned the cam-
pus and caught all by surprise. Apparent
ly, according to various sources. Zirkle
was experiencing heart pains and decided
to drive himself to the hospital. His wife,
also a professor at Grinnell, was in
Georgia attending the funeral of her sister.

Zirkle made it to the ramp before Hie
emergency entrance of Grinnell General
Hospital where he parked the van but lelt
the motor running. People leaving the
hospital noticed the van at 6:00 pm. Frir
day evening. Zirkle's body was discovered
at 3:25 am the next morning. A medical
examiner was Called in to determine the
exact Cause of death and Zirkle’s body was
taken to Smith Funeral Home. It was
determined he had been dead for quite
some time.

Zirkle was teaching two major art
courses, one of which, Design, is required
for an art major. The suddenness of his
death has left the department with a major
hole in its program. At press time, the
department and administration were cone
sidering several options.

President George Drake said that since
Merle and Glen Zirkle were on a joint con—
tract, there could be difficulty in hiring a
replacement.

Chairman of the Department, Richard
Cervene, said it was possible that Mrs.
Zirkle would take on the classes or so
meone from ouaide would be brought in.
As Mrs. Zirkle teaches a ceramics course
at the same time as his Design class, there
is a problem with simply increasing her
workload.

This week his classes were not cancelle
ed. , . ,

“They will not be formally meeting with
an instructor [for the time being] but they
are to continue with their projects,”

Cervene said. ,

Cervene said he has gone in from time to '
time to check on students and to see if
there were any problems.

Students are assured that they will not
be forced to drop the classes.

“Obviously our first concern iS' the
obligation to the students. I am sure the
dean and the department will do
everything we can to cover the classes,”
Robert McKibbin, associate professor of
art. said.

The campus and town community alike
have expressed their shock and sadness at
Zirkle's untimely death. Smith Funeral
Home reported 50-75 visitors wishing to
pay their respects on the morning of Tues
day, Oct. 7. That afternoon. the somber
queues of people waiting to attend the
Memorial Service stretched from within
Herrick Chapel out into the street.

Chaplain Dennis Haas, one of Zirkle’s
close friends, returned from London,
where he was participating in the Grinnell-
in-London program, to deliver the eulogy.
And long time friend Jack Worley, a Grins
nell philosophy professor, returned from
Washington DC. to attend Zirkle's
funeral.

Zirkle, who started out as a Silversmith
before he turned to sculpture, is probably
best known among students for the Central
Campus sculpture, “The Zirkle," he
designed. Another one of his Well known
works is the “Screw" in the foyer of the
Science Building.

However, to better appreciate the scope
and variety of his work both Haas and
McKibbin pointed to the chalice that is us-
ed for Communion in Herrick Chapel.
“The studenu really need to know how we
ceptional Mr. Zirkle was,” McKibbin, col-
league and personal friend of Zirkle for 11
years, said. “They need only to look at that
particular piece [the chalice] and hold it
and realize that it started out as a flat
piece of silver. It’s absolutely pristine,
symmetrical, absolutely exquisite."

“As a craftsman] could think of no other
human being that I’ve ever met or will pro—
bably meet again that could use material
like Glen Zirkle . . . Not only could he
