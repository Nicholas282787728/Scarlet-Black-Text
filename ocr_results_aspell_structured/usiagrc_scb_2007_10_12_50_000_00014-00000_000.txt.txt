Don’t let Lyle’s
wedge out Wedge

The whimsy and Grinnelisness shown by the student body
last spring in electing to name the campus pub after a ﬁctional
Character made Inc incredibly proud to be a Gi'lnnclliatl. It
showed that Grinnell. itlcuts really do have a pioneering spirit
and an open mrnd Alter all, how many campus pubs are named
for beloved NONFICTIONAL campus figures or alumni?
How many tampr pubs, in tile ivorlcl> i\lost, ifnot all ofrlrem,
1d wag Thc dc n to name the pub after Wedge, a be-
loved ﬁctional
campus ﬁgs

have been un-
precedented,
Revolutionary,
even.

me,
“Lyle's” just
sounds like
a n o t h e t
“Bob's.” Does anyone know who the original Bob was? Please
enlighten me if you do. I fear that wrth time, the significance
behind naming the pub aftei Lyle will be lost, leaving yet air
other campus feature named after “some guy." Do you really
want to do that to Lyle>

Wedge, on the other hand, is a uniquc narnc,1t's quirky
enough to retain its significance for along time,since the mem,
ory of a fictional character does not fade as quickly as that of
a real person. just look at Wedge Antilles’ participation in the
SGA clcction processiyou have to admit, the guys got staying
power!

Furthermore, the time for naming the pub was last spring,
in the official elections held foi that purpose.There were plenty
of names for consideration then, and, while it is unfortunate
that “Lyle's” was not an option at the time, it is unfair to enter~
tain the name now, without the competition ofthc other names
to consider, Changing the name now is a poor precedent to set,
in my opinioniit leaves the door open for all manner ofpostr
deadline candidates and last minute decision reversals

Also, the antirAntilles tirade in the outline of the initiative
is canonically and fundamentally incorrect, but don't get me
started on that.

Let’s make the correct dCCISlDl] here, Grinnell. Let's decide
to uphold uniqueness, longevity, and most importantly, fair
electoral procedures. Do not change the name otthc campus
pub from Tire Wedge to Lylc's, and allow Lylc to be honored
another way,

Launches a two-
pronged reproach

Reading page 10 otlast weeks 388 was particularly trus-
trating. Both the staff editorial and Anna Gilbert 0% column
attacked the efforts of two groups of people on campus I have
great respect for: SGA and the trustees.

Gilbert’s column dispelled the belief that SGA is a clique,
which I appreciated, but she continued on to say that SGA
could be doing more to engage the student body and that their
“open door policy" wasn't enough. As an active student with
several good friends in SGA,I find that statement very affair
Slve. Everyone I know in SGA is doing all they can and more to
figure out what our student body needs.They are the most ded-
icarcd people I have ever met and I don’t think we should blame
them for the lack ofstudcnt participation on campus. SGA has
done all they can to bring students out oftheir apathetic state,
and I think their efforts are rewarded with small victories like
the record number ofstudent initiatives this semester. Ifsomer
one is frustrated with the lack ofstudcnr participation in SGA,
maybe they could show up to a joint Board, or a senator open
forum, or a fireside chat. and not worry about where they are
on campus, how long they rake or iithey've been appropriately

advertised.

The staff editoiial, “Mr. Trustee, tear down that wall," per-
petuated Gribert’s stereotype of administrative bodres as fact.»
less and not in touch with studentsTho editorial claimed that
the open foliim is the only way for thi: average student to get in
contact with the trustees. This is trite, but misleading. They also
said that last semesters open fortim was almost cancelled, ifnot
for the eﬂoits of I Tl’, which is not title. linysclf asked Chiis
Hall, last year's SGA president, to let me make a pr rtation
for a student group along with FTP, and 1 did. It was srmplc as
that. no “"effort involved I did the same thing at this semestCi 5
open forum, and not only ditl the tiiistces 11ng me \iitl my fellow
presenters great questions, but stayed around for about a hour
iftcr the event to talk to students (notjust the presenters) about
their concerns on campus. Many gave out their personal ennui
so students could contact them with any further concerns they
might have.

1 think rt rs very easy for students to blame SGA .rnd the
trustees for problems of lack of interaction. The titistees have
lives, and so do SGA members They are not going to hrrnr
pcoplc down and ask them about their problems lftlicy did
most probably would get annoyed There are many ways to
get in touch with SGA and the trustees, and both groups aie
incredibly receptive to input or just increased dialogue. They
aren't pcrfect, but they're easy and manageable, ityou want to
talk to trustees, go to thc forum. If it can't wait, go to Susan
Schoen in Nollen House and ask her to get in touch with a
tiustee or two. (lfthe concern is legitimate, she always says yes.)
lfyou want to learn more about campus, go to a Joint Board, or
walk in to the SGA ofﬁces, or even just stop Cabinet members
inside the dining hallThey would love to talk to you.

Are students
speaking Russian?

The editorial this last week (Mr. Trustee, Tear Down that
Wall) highlighted that communicating with the trustees can be
hard for students to do and perhaps steps can be taken to reduce
the barrier between the groups and catalyze a discourse between
the campus community, the administration, faculty and trust»
ees. Like most ofthe “battle cries"ofGrinnell students, this Is it
woeful mischuracterization and OVBf’SlmpllflC‘MlDll of reality

billion go to a socrally beneﬁcial use, such as providing funding
tor clean power or micrerloans in impoverished communities,
that is not the purpose of the endowment and rt is not the
purpose ofthe Board otTrusteesThe endowment is to provide
the college with a poition of its operating budget and the role
attire Board otTrustees, m the words ofrtustcejoel sprcgel, is
“sound governance and ﬁscal responsibility," Not to build wind

The trustees hare power, and the students know that but

they don't neees .rily want it, it rs up to the students to learn
the roles ofthese intuitions and “tear down that wall."

SGA tackles
drunk driving

Thank you very much for your Sept 21 editorial regarding
drunk driving at Grinnell The statistics surrounding this rssuc
caught many people by surprise at the beginning ofthis school
year, and this is something we find gravely disconcerting.

since we returned to campus in August, SGA has taken
rnulrrsfacetcd approach to combating this problem. While we
did launch a postering campaign early on in an attempt to
spread awareness among students, SGA cabinet and senators
are new working toward implementing a diverse set ofstrate—
gics for encouraging student responsibilitv

First, wc believe it is essential to publicize services that al—
ready exist on campus to keep students safe. The Ofﬁce ofScr
currty currently pledges to give students a ride home from any
location in Grinncll, regardless of their age or state of mind.
Rather than driving home fiom the pub or another off-campus
location, students should feel free to call Security at x4600 for
assistance any time they experience this need.

Secondly, SGA has met with Grinnell Police Chief Jody
Matheily, who emphasized the local police department’s Inter
est in keeping snrdcnts and locals safe. If students park cars
downtown and cannot drive home safely, they can call to irr-
forin the policc department and will not be ticketed for leaving
their vehicles overnight.

Finally, the Safety and Securrty Advisory Committee is
working to produce a series of materials publicizing the dair
gers and legal statutes associated with drunk driving. We hope
these materials will be available to students before fall break,
and that the committee \vrll continue to respond to other ideas
and suggestions as they arise.

Diunk driving is a problem that none ofus takes lightly, and
we are absolutely committed to doing all we can to address it.
We know the Sffijoins us in taking this issue seriously, and are
grateful for the chance to continue dialog about rhr best course
ofaction for the future.

—SGA Cabinet
