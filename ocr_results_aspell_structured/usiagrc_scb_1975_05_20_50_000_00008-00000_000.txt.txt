The Grinnell Scarlet and Black, May 20, 1975—111

Impressions, vibrations

by Charles N. Davis

My impressions of Grinnell are based on
vibrations, and vibrations ior me are usually a
mixture of things concrete and inmngible, and things
that flow in and out of the mind like an enigmatic
dream, a good moment that passes too quickly, or a
bad moment that lingers too long,

Generally, the vibrations have been good ones, In
particular, I have learned much through iormal and
iniormal associations with colleagues, townspeople
and students. There are, no doubt, a lot 0! good things
happening at Grinnell. i like its insistence on
academic excellence; and i like the unpretentious
iniormality which provides, for me, a necessary
degree of relaxation in order better to discuss and
exchange ideas,

As Chairman of the Black Studies Program, I am
delighted to see general student interest in areas
which do not necessarily iit into one’s major but
which are of vital importance to any solid liberal arts
exposure, or course, everyone knows that all is not
peaches and cream at Grinnell. Such is rarely, if
ever. the case anywhere The college certainly has
areas in which either more commitment is needed or
more honesty about its goals revealed; but, like that
bad moment that lingers too long, this notion is only
one that l have received from vibrations, not con-
iirmed through experience I mention it only as a
weatherman issues a warning against conditions
iavorable to a gathering tunnel cloud ot substantial
proportion and impact

I want particularly to say ‘Right on!’ to the
students at Grinnell~not only to the various interest
groups, which have done a wonderful job in in-
creasing general awareness oi national and his
ternational issues on campus, but also to those
students who, not perhaps iinding the time to really
get involved in other activities, have performed very
well in class. I do hope, however, that we see more
coming together or the various groups tthat includes
CBS, the Women's Group, The Third World Sudy
Group, and all othersl l strongly ieel that we are, all
of us. doing a disservice to ourselves, our objectives
and—or future existence on campus it we do not put

our minds and resources together and become more
alleampus—oriented and academic in our ideas and
projects.

Finally, a hearty “Welcome!" both to new and
returning students. 1 hope i get the opportunity oi

, meeting with all oiyou Good luck at Grinnell,

In passing

hyhlreste .
There seems to be a number of reactions to
graduation, most of which are varieties of sen»

timentality and ecstasy. There are sobering thoughts ,

that come to mind as well, though, and it strikes me
that we ought not to go away in too much oi a haze

One is left with a sense, after whirling through the
quadrille of Senior Week activities, that this class is a
commune oi iriends, a lamily perhaps, a unit in any
case. Where this ~feeling comes from, however, is
unclear; a short course oi common hysteria, maybe,
or the rosy glow imparted by continuous intoxication.

Cast your minds back to the hurly-burly oi mid-
semester, when nothing is coming up, nothing has
just happened, and think of this community then,
Suddenly the notion oi a body oi people dissolves, and
one is immersed in a sea oi personalities, mostly
loathsomer How then can this be the first this, the last
that, when we never really experienced one another
individually. let alone in toto?

Most readers of this will protest at the use of the
world “loathsome". But try to piece that curtain of
nostalgia which is already beginning to weave itseli
now that exams are over, papers and (most)
belongings in boxes. Try one last time to remember
the everyday reactions, the unsweetened relation-
ships, beiore they iade into the distance. One oi the
most frequent topics of dinner-table conversations
tapart irom tall tales about allrnighters and endless
pages, or course) is the latest tight, the latest threat,
the latest break-up. We do despise one another,
mostly; we do regard ourselves as the superiors oi
our iellows. Perhaps this is to be expected in a milieu
where excellence is at a premium. It may be that we
have been at such pains to hone our critical iaculties
(and rightly so) that we cannot stop practicing.

So we find one another loathsome. When we are not
deluded by exhaustion, or separation, or perception
of beauty, we ﬁnd ourselves looking for means to
escape our iellows' company. The various means oi
delusion become our only keys to society (such
elementary ones as manners and consideration
having become passe).

Let us not delude ourselves on one point, however.
We will not iind ourselves in the company oi people
any less despicable, any less impossible to talk to,
any less revolting to be with. once we get to the
“outside", to the “real world”, This is the real world;
that is to say, the real world is that place where one
must operate on a dayrtoday basis and cope with
problems as they come instead oi abstraetly. We do
that here (or we avoid it), and We vlill do it “out
there” ior wc will avoid ill, and our methods will not
change. Our eiiiciency has increased, presumably, as
a result of our labors here, but our methods remain
the same.

The fond distinction between the ivory tower and

the cold hard world, then, is shaky Sure, we don't
have to support ourselves here, sure, we can devote
time to the liie oi the mind, but there are a lot oi iolks
out in the cold, hard world who don't work ior their
livelihoods either. That is a specious distinction.
Coping is everywhere.

indeed, the despicaoility oi our comrades in the
workaday world is apt to be even greater than here.
The fact that some work with their hands does not
make them any more ”genuine" or “honest" or
“direct", Rousseau and the Romantics to the Con»
trary. The fact that we are here after being selected
ior intelligence and creativity and sensitivity and
heaven knows what else means, among other things,
that the prospect oi iinding these qualities in the
random sample oi the restoi our lives is lower.

Do we iind our iellows loathsome, do we strain at
the bit to avoid their company? Do not count, my
rriends, on an Elysium to come. “Out there" is no
diiierent from here. We are neither commencing nor
passing irom one state to another. The surroundings
will change, but the ashes will remain the same.

IOWA

by Sandy Rikoon

Iowa is a woman in her
middle years
with hands wadded

Up in her apron.

Her eyes are dry and
iearless

Because of loo many poor
crops and too many
dead Children

Cynicism is not in her
makeupi

Only hard understanding;

Her mouth is lender because of
sunsets

At her feel is a daisy chain,—

She touches it gently with the
toe of her shoe,

Remembering when she wore it
in her hair

Funerals
& graduations s

by John Hansen
I‘ve really never enjoyed
iunerals, The required proprietye
saving and doing just the right
things are disturbing enough, but
the linality of it all is completely
unsettling. Unfortunately, those
few Whose lotitis to design and run
graduations are a strange breed,
somewhat akin to morticians. They
too are concerned that everyone
sayand dojust the rightthings: the
smiling, yet depressed faces, the
ceremony, the wake—it's all there.
Well, so be it. Perhaps this year it's
particularly appropriate.
with every class some memories
die: in this respect our class is no
diiierent than last year’s or next
year's. But as this year's seniors
leave, a world View, a lifestyle. and
an academic idealism will be
shuffling out the door behind them.
it was in the spring of our fresh-
man year that Nixon decided to
bomb Cambodia»\ve were in the
streets protesting with latesnight
meetings and marches. ”Candles
tor Peace" or some such thing
Students, protessors, and ad-
ministrators were all there as
equal members at a community,
equally shocked, equally
dismayed If the President were
now to decide to bomb Cambodia
tas, strangely enough. he did this
week) is there anyone who really
believes that there would be even
so much as an allrcollege meeting?
And if there was such an allccllege
meeting, who would attend?
Students? Professors? Ad-
ministrators? As equal members
at a community? Equally shocked?
No, our class is the last to Witness a
Grinnell college community with
such a world View.
what did you do last Friday
night? What did you do any Friday
01‘ Saturday night this semester? A

lot of my friends and I spent these
weekends studying. Four years
ago such perverse actions were not
tolerated Perhaps we're just more
dedicated to academics these days.
Or perhaps we’re less dedicated to
ourselves Academically speaking,
the Grinnell Experience is simply
not worth $4500 a year. l used to
think it would be worth that
amount, however, just to live at the
college and not take any classes.
The nonaacadernic education and
experience was well worth the
money. Perhaps the drugcriented
society was or great value even to
the non-drugoriented. These days
you ask a freshman why he came
here and he’ll tell you ”to study”;
anything else gets in the way To
regularly completely iorget about
academics and enjoy being with .
and learning from other people7
we are the last class to remember
such experiences

Remember the gentleman's
”C”? Remember passefail, n0
grade, grading? Remember the 3.5
Dean's list" These were all phas'cd
out early in our academic careers.
That non-competitive academic ,
idealism is on the way out alld
we‘re on the way out with it.

There have been other lna
stltutional changes which have
signiiicantly altered the quality oi
life here. Remember sit-down
dinner? when bus-yourrown was
an irregularity. reserved ior iinals
week? Remember hamburgers
from Allrvano's? The Women's
Gym7 So many changes occurred
just alter our lreshman year; more
than between any other two years
in recent memory.

So perhaps a dirge is in order, or,
better yet, a wake. This [uncral I
will hate as much as all the others,
hut it's better to remember and be
sad, than not remember at all.

I haven‘t written anything ex-

it's in the right place). calm an

no title, no author, no number, or
any other identiiying marks. 1 can

even lift tell [at library books with '

admit I could do that when l was a
student but. . .ii 1 ever got into a

right jab cultivated through many
long hours of stamping March 22,
March 22, March 22, on many
many books.

Last semester, when l was still a
student attending this illustrious
establishment, instead of a
steadfast and loyal employee, in
other words, paying instead oi
being paid, lguess 1 sort or took all
the people thatwork in Burling and
the Forum and everywhere else ior
granted. I’ve learned to appreciate
both the boredom, the work, and
the rewards involved in many of
the jobs that it takes to operate this
place. There were times, MANY
times. when l thought i would die
oi boredom, or Just or not having
talked to any one in whole hours
(the library isn’t always teeming
with hordes of thousands~try
popping there at around one am.
Saturday (what a waste oi a
Friday night), but i had it easy
compared to some people who
work tor the college Can you
imagine having to walk irom
building to building to building all
night long just to punch a clock in
each one of them so they’d know
you’d been there” Or spending
every niglll. from 11 until 7 in the
morning sweeping and builing the

floors of the library, most of the
time with no one to talk to and the
other half of the time being
surrounded by students too elitist
to talk to anyone who didn’t go to
college?

There is a good side oi it though.
I’ve talked tu more people about
more different things and ideas
during the semester I’ve worked as
one of the “waitresses of
academia” than I did the3'o years,
I went to school here. i have come
to judge people, not by reputation,
not by how they act in the ”real
world” of Grinnell, Iowa, or even
the “unreal world” of Grinnell
College, but by the way they act in
the library. The most boorish and
the most gracious qualities- ot
individuals surface when they are
dependent upon someone else ior a
service, or ior something they
really need, or think they really
need.

My Overall conclusion about
Grinnell, as Viewed from the not-
so.ivory tower behind Burling desk
didn’t really surprise me: there
are an awfully lot of really NICE,
really lonely people in Grinnell and
a lot of them spend a lot of time in
the library, not studying, some of
them not even pretending to study,
just looking ior someone to talk to,
or to smile at them, Anyway I like
Grinnell people a lot better irom
this vantage point than l did wheni
was in the same boat as everyone
else.
