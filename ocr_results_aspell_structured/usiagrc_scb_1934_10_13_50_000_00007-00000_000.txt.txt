Bernier again: John spent an
cnjoynblc alter-roan, the other day
chiming Mu'riel Waters around the
tennis courts and furthermore, to
quote Miss Waters: “He wasn’t
tooling either." Ber-trier reiused
to commit himseli heyond remark-
ing in a quiet way that still waters

run deep.

Cobblc’s tirst excursion in the ' e
of picnics turned out rather disas—
terously. He couldn’t get his girl to

Farly last week Mr. Baxter
siuith gratetnliy accepted Miss

Marian Kiwreman’s invitation to

the women’s varsity. Came the

total night and no Smith showed
up at the quad. Koorcman, some.
what perturbed, had a triend coil
the dorms and received the glad
tidings that Baxter had wandered
oli somewhere, apparently chliv.
ions that there was such a thing
as a dance. Kooreman is said to
have remarked that it elephants

don’t iorget, jackasses certainly tlo..

The name Don Thomas conjures up
visions of a melancholy Don Juan,
smitten with the usual languishing
(ever that overtakes all preps lrctore
the first leaves of autumn have fall»
en. 01 late he has even taken to she
swering the Dihhle phone with the
soft salutation oi: "Third flour Mears
speaking."

it is announced by those who
know that the local country club
has installed a special service ior
those who picnic on the greens. To
aid pedestrians in crossing the
swamp in from of the club house,
ﬂood lights have been installed.

Seven Little Freshman Girls drew
Seven Little Cards out of Seven Lit»
tle Mailboxes last Monday morning,
All Seven Little Girls beheld the same
thing, to wit:

“Lovely Little Lady;

Without wanting to hurt your feel»
ings or anything oi the like, we’d like
to throw some light on the higeshot
prep, Mr. Tracy Garrett The little
man for social, religious, and political
reasons, CARD INDEXES his lady
friends, and classifiesgihem according
to their merits or demerits. The mark»
ings are as follows: Blank, Poor! * very
average; w Good; ”’Excellent. Thus
you are rated. To get some more
sidelights compare with Misses Lor-
raine Eckert, Portia Clarke, Muriel
Waters, Peggy Thompson, Catherine
Bousquet, Dorothy Hussleman, and
and Lavonhe Beuckelman.

So instead or the whole heaven you
thought you were to him, you are just

, another card in the index. God Bless
You."

OPEN LETTER FROM THE EDr
ITOR: All tooling aside, Mr. Garrett,
which one is the real three star Ben-
nessy?

An enthusiach group turned out
to hear the Read choral club in
from of the dorms the other night.
What tew rowdies were present
conﬁned themselves to remarks of
a personal nature and nowhere
was there criticism of the warh-
ling. Although the repertoire was
somewhat limited, alt present were
impressed when the right wing oi
the ensemble took “Here Come
the British," the lelt wing took
“God Save the King,” the center
look “The Peanut Vendor,” and
Miss James joined in with “Rock
of Ages” on her acoordian. The
most astute judges at music in the
dorms declared ihal they never
had under any circumstances,
heard anything like it,

P. s. As we go to press, the man
who threw the apple core at the
alto section has not been appre-
hcnded.

CHAPEL
NOTES

H. s. Conard, pmiessor of botany,
conducted the chapel service this week,
speaking on the general theme, “Things
and marl,"

In opening his series of talks on
Monday he endeavored to demonstrate
how illuminating and encouraging the
study of nature in any of its aspects
may be, through recognition o[ its
orderliness and essential fidelity.

On Wednesday, the Rev. ML.G. F,
Wilder at Red Oak having been in
charge on Tuesday, Professor Cunard
brought out The fact that lile involves
adjustment to nature and fitness to
one’s environment Each type of life,
he asserted, must be ﬁtted for its
own environment and each environ»
ment requires a separate fitness.

During his closing talk he pointed
out th t college students have a great
possib ity to widen their environment,
and that they should fit themselves,
during their college days, tor the type
of environment they anticipate. By
books and teachers a one can be
anywhere and “any—when", Professor
Canard concluded, and one’s environ»
ment can be made whatever he wi s.

The Rev. Mr, Wilder, in his Talk
Tuesday, emphasized the rapidity with
which time flies. He mentioned the
inscription over a clock on the Oxford
campus which reads, “Tempus fugit,”

Everyone should plan his time so that
every minute is used, or he is bound
to regret the waste later on, he corr-
eluded.

GRINNELL HOME SCHEDULE

 

OCTOBER 13 - - CARLETON [HOMECOMING]
OCTOBER 26 - - HASKELL INSTITUTE
NOVEMBER Z4--CORNELL

 

With only three games being played on the home field
this year, it seems as if the fans should plan to attend all of
them, A real crowd of rooting, boosting, cheering Grinnellians
helps the team, makes them fight harder and gives that added

incentive that Sometimes makes a winning football team.
