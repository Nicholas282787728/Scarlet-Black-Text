Coach Bill Boelter‘s cagers will be

at the hands of the Pioneers, for
Grinneli was the only Missouri Valley
conference team to whip the Bulldogs
twice during the 1929-30 season. In

Des Moines outfit won once from

Important Conference Game
Just by way of rubbing salt into
the wound the two Grinnell victories
were closer than a picnic couple on
a moon-lit night. Sensational last-
minute shooting by the Pioneers gave
them a 3229 extra-period victory
over Drake in the ﬁrst game played

‘ Gandhi Similar

to St. Francis
in Page Belief

Indian Leader, Kagawa Win
Freedom With Sound
Peace Methods

No two men in the modern world
so resemble St. Francis of Assisi, or
are so reminiscent of Jesus of
Nazareth, as Kagawa of Japan and
Gandhi of India, according to Kirby
Page, speaking in Herrick chapel last
night. The pacifist, lecturer, and edi-
tor of the World Tomorrow was vis-
iting Crinneil under the auspices of
the Young Men's Christian associa-
tion.

Gandhi’s identification of himself
with the miseries and sorrows of his
people, and the same policy on the
part of the Japanese leader were
stressed by Mr. Page. The two men
have resolved to separate themselves
from all hate, pride, and desire, the
Speaker pointed out.

Wants Natives in Jail

Gandhi's theory of meekness and
non~resistellce is carried out in his
method of revolution it was shown.
He wishes only to get so many In-
dians in j l for not co-operating
with the British rulers that there will
not be enough natives to assist the
foreigners in governing, "Knocking
out the props that support the evil
system" was Page's phrase to de-,
scribe the Indian mystic's method,
pointing out that native props are
necessary to English rule. There are
not enough Englishmen there to rule
alone.

“Without firing a gun, without re-
sorting to violence in any form,
Gandhi is striving to free his own
country, and Kagawa is working for
democracy in Japan,” the speaker
remarked in summing up his ali~
dress.

Gandhi Method Sound

Kirby Page dwelt on the soundness

of Gandhi's method. Less than one

dead by a. neighbor at his home in
Brooklyn, 17 miles east of Grinnell,

By LUIDA WEN'DELL

Through the eyes of Viscount Shi—
busawa, 90—year old Japanese "J. P.
Morgan." Kirby Page had the unique
experience of seeing Japan in per-
spective. Mr. Page found the patri—
arch in a reminiscent mood one day,
and talked with him about his tiny
nation.

”This mail,"
of me World Tomorrow,
when Commodore Perry came to
Japan, and was chairman of the
committee which received President
U. S. Grant when he made his tour
around the world. He has probably
seen as drastic changes in a country
as any man living."

Wurst Earthquake in Japan

Mr. Page described Japan's dra~
matic growth out of fcudalistic regime
in the life of one man;how today
it faces a dilemma which, if im-
properly met, will spell rain. The
small territory, only onc acre out of
six of which can be cultivated,
coupled with a population which is
increasing at the rate of 3,000 a year,
would eventually put an end to all
progress.

Solution for Japan

Japan hasn't even the three basic
requirements of manufacturing, coal,
iron, and oil. It would be tragedy in-
deed to see such incredible ambition
dauhted, for ‘tbis people "Started from
scratch," as Mr. Page phrased it, and
recovered a two billion dollars loss in
seven years “with a snap of the fing-
81‘s.”

Rayon Injures Silk Sales

They must compete in industry
with England and the United States.
The replacement of rayon Ior silk has
made serious inroads upon their tra-
ditional business in silk.

”If Japan were faced only with in-
dustrial problems, it might hope for
Survival,” Mr. Page continued, “but
her thirteen millions of voters, with
their increasing scientific education
and modem industry, have scriouslyl
undermined national faith in divine
emperors with their radical views.

“It could be said of Japan that
democracy is growing there, while it
is declining in other countries. Rep-
resentative government is making
enormous gains in Japan.

‘Drama as Social Force’

Address to Precede

Open Forum

George Pierce Baker, who will dis<
cuss ”Drama. as a Social Force” to-
morrow night in Herrick chapel, is
the man who has made the college
trained playwright respected on
Broadway, For lb years, 13 st Har-
vard and five at Yale, he and his
students have been writing and pro-
ducing many of the country's best
plays.

Mrs, Sara Sherman Pryor, director
of the Grinnell experlmautnl theater
believes that the Subject of Mr. Bak-
er's address will enable him to include
a wide variety of topics. Beginning
at 8 o'clock, he will talk of the drama
in relation to life's problems, and at
the end of his address will hold a
15—minute open forum, during which
questions concerning his work will
be answered.

Developed Playwrights

As head of ’ the departmentl of
drama at Yale university. and form-
erly in that position at Harvard, Mr.
Baker has developed a large number
of the leading playwrights of the day.
Eugene O'Neill, Winthrop Ames, Ed-
ward Sheldon, and Philip Barry were
aspiring students under this dramat-
ist’s tutelage.

During Prof. Baker's first two
years at .Yale in 1925-26, Mrs. Pryor
studied in his “47 Workshop," major
ing in playwriting and mincring in
production. For entrance, a college
degree and a well—written one—act
play are required.

Pride, Cnesin Enrolled

At the Same Lime that Grinnell's
director was enrolled in the school,
Leo Pride, a playwright, and Maurice
Gnesin, now head of the department
of drama at the Goodman theater,
Chicago, were also students.

Probably the greatest piece of in-
dividual writing and production that
Mr. Baker has accomplished is the
Plymouth pageant, which was pre-
sented 10 years ago. It was the ter-
centenary of the landing of the Pil—
grims.
