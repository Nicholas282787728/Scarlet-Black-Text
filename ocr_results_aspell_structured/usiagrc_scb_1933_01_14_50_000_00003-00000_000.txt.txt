THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Brilliant “Mikado”

Mark New Epoch ln Drama Work

Critic Pays High Tribute
to Pryor, Director

of Comedy

By H .w. lllntlirck
(Professor of Organ»
Few will disagree with the opnionl
that ”The Mikado,” by Gilbert and
Sullivan, which was so brilliantly
presented in Herrick chapel Wednes-
day and Thursday, was the finest
show of its kind, professional or amzk
tour, that has ever been given in
Grinnell. Everyone concurs in the
hope that it marks a new find fruit—
ful epoch in college drama, for such
productions have an educational
value for their participants fully‘eq-
iial to their entertainment value for
the spectators.

No Particular Stars i

It is difficult to single out the
particular stars in so uniformly ex-
cellent performance. The big credit
must go to the commandereinechief.
Sara Sherman Pryor, who wrought
the conflicting interests of music, acte
ing and staging into a smoothly
flowing and well accented unity with
consummate skill. Next in order is
the musical director, Chester Wil-
liams. who held the reins of the swift
performance with a sure and steady
hand. All the work of preparation,
thorough as it was, would have been
shot to pieces had his handling of all
the tricky situations not been so com»
petent. Then there are Harald Holst.
who drilled the singers, and Bernice
Cooper. who taught both principals[
and chorus to tread like elephants or
trlp’ like fairies as the situations re
quired. Judging from certain scenes_
between Katisha and Koko there wast
also an athletic coach on the staff!
but his name wasn’t given.

The stage was a wonderful picturel
viewed from any angle, and it framed-
every situation from Katisha’s heaue
tiful solo to the spectacular finales
with gorgeous effectiveness. Credit'
for this gay setting is Sophus Han—
sen’s, for he designed, built, and
painted it with the eye and hand of a
genius. The cleverness with which the
apse of the chapel was converted in-
to a modern stage is almost incred-l
ihle. It looks as if the experimental
‘theatre staff could stage "Midsum-
mer night's Dream” in the chemical
laboratory if it had to.

Tragedy and Comedy >

With three such experienced andl

 

talented artists in the cast as Miss
Pratt, Mr. Holst and Mr. Peck. the
thing was bound to be a success. As
was Sullivan’s custom, the big aria
is always given to the most sinister
character, and Miss Pratt as Katisha.
was tragedy personified all the way
through until she melted on Koko’s
shoulder with a covness that was to
him still fraught with tragedy. Holst’s
hig voice and fine acting made Koko
the star comedy part the composers
intended.

These two would be stars on any
stage. and so would D. E. Peck, who
carried off with pompous bravado
the caricature of the big stuffed shirt
in Pooh—Bah. Nor was this all that
Dave carried off, for he carried the
squealing Yum-Yum [D o r o t h y
Rowles) off the stage over his shoul-
der, when she tried to sidestep get-
ting married to her sweetheart. Nan-
ki-Poo (Robt. Shoulberg) because it
would involve her in such a 'stuffy
death."

Has Gay Spirit

Koko. Katisha and Pooh-Bah. the
three experienced members of the
cast, were so full of verve (Victorian
for "pep") that they inspired all
their amateur collaborators with the
gay spirit of the opera. A high stane
dard of musical as well as witty ex-
cellence prevailedithere are many
wonderfully fine musical passages in
the operaiso that the production
never for a moment degenerated into
rough burlesque. Even Mr. Holst as
Koko showed us quite another side of
his personality than he usually re..
veals, but he did it with such grace-
ful abandon in the big scene with
Katisha (she stands alon%imd how!)

Performance May

that they were rccallcd again and
again,

There were so many good things
in this performance that it would
take a couple of pages of The Scar-
let and Black to list them. The three
little girls from school (Dorothy
Rowles, Laura hiatusek, Winifred
Webster) were just as shy—now and
Lhcniaud as pretty all the time as,
they claimed to be. The third of the
“noble lords," Jack Peoples. held his
own with the lusty vociferations of
Peck and Holst. The famous trio in
the first act, where these three loyal
citizens pass the buck to one an-
other, \undmg up with the patter-
song about “a cheap and chippy chop.
per on a big black black” was one of
the big hits of the performance.

Shoulherg \Vitxes Romantic

Nanki-Poo, the romantic tenor, was
well acted and sung by Shouldherg
in spite of his having had to do so
much rehearsing in the hospital, and
Howard Warrintou was the spirit and
image of an Oriental potentate with
a touch of paresis in his ancestry.
Maurice Birdsall had a silent part as
the bearer of the Mikado-s sacred
umbrella, but although his face was
as immobile as his tongue. his top-
knot was sufficiently eloquent.

The audiences contained admiring
spectators from the more advanced
centers of music and culture in Iowa,
and they saw a performance which
will long he remembered. Every indie
vidual of the more than one hundred
people in the cast and staff was en-
thusiastically on the job, and gave
us the best half-dollar's worth of one
tertainment I have ever seen. But
what 1 don’t understand is how so
many stayed away. Can it be that
the ghostly shadow—drama from Hol-
lywood has benumhed the taste for
the living stage. or is it just hecuse
so many don’t know what a gorgeous
and exhilarating thing “The Mikado”
IS?

(Continued from page 1y

[casor Conard has been giving a
course in field botany at Cold Springs
lHai-hor, Long Island. Last summer,
one of the members of his class there
(was Helen French, '34. Miss Louisa
lSalgcnt, assistant profc-sor of hots
any here, will assist him next sumv

l mer.

Last October, the McGr-aw-Hill Co.
of New York, published “Plant Soc
ology." by Dr. J. Braun-Blanquet, a
Swiss botanist. translated from Ger
man into English by Prof. Conard and
John Eisen, (31, and edited by Prof.
G. D Fuller of the University or Chl-
cago The book had a good sale, and
one of the critics says that it is so
‘aptly translated that it is hard to
‘believe it was originally in a forcign
language,

Professor Conard is one of
three charter members of the Grin-
nell chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. When
lGrlunell was granted a charter in the
lsoclely, he, with .l. H, T. Main, presi-
dent of Grinnell at that time. and
Dudley smith, former director of the
.school of music, were the three sign-
ers of the application.

Professor Conara's three children
were all admitted to Phi Beta Kappa
while students at Grinnell. The Okla
cst, Elizabeth, ’25, holds an M. D. de—
gree from Michigan, and is now as-
‘sistaiit professor in the Women's
Medical college of Shanghai, China.
Another daughter, Rebecca. '30. is
now working in occupational thcropy
in the Michigan state hospital at
Ypsilanti. A son, Alfred, '32, is well
known to most of the present genera-
tion of Grinnelians. While here he was
a meinher of the staff of the Mal-
teaser and Scarlet and Black, and a
member of the Swimming and cross
country teams. He is now studying
law at the University of Iowa
