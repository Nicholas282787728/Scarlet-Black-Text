A LUXURY WE CANNOT AFFORD
(Christian Science Monitor)

Not so long ago a college education was looked up-
on in America as a luxury. At one time only the most
prosperous citizens could afford to send their children
to institutions of higher learning. And a sizeable per-
centage of these, in sending their children, were actuat-
ed by the belief that a social prestige so gained was the
greatest accruing benefit.

Times change. And concepts broaden. Today we
hear Dr. L, R, Alderman, director in work relief educa-
tion for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration,
declare that ignorance “is the most expensive thing in
the World.”

At this same Lime we learn several pertinent facts
in connection with this work. We learn, for instance,
that the Federal Government is distributing 32,000,000
a month to the states so that 40,000 unemployed teach-
ers may give instruction to those who need it, and that
all but four states have definite programs in this came
paign for literacy.

“Ignorance which results in low standards and am
perst ions, and retards social developments,“ Dr. Alder»
man said further, “fails to balance the supposed sav-
ings in direct expenditures for education.”

The old theory of education as a social advantage,
and the later, and equally erroneous one, of education
as giving the individual an economic advantage over his
less fortunate fellow, are fast giving way to the fact
that education’s greatest value is in the raising of the
educational level of the nation as n whole through a
system that reaches every individual to some extent.

The old belief that only a few individuals are caps»
ble of taking advantage or higher education is one of
the weights that will retard progress, Not every man or
woman will make a great lawyer or architect, not every
one will find in a college curriculum the kind of educa-
tion he most needs, but wow ”the the ccuscientious
person will benefit.
