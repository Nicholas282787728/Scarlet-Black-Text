OR ‘several years Giliinell
hasbeen almost wholly rr-ee

front such exhibitions of uklddlil"

ness" as the stealing ot reheslr
merits at social gatherings. This
is something that requires neither
brains lior courage, and is a poor
way to get entertainment. The
same energy could be spent in ace
complislllng something really
worth while, and no one would be
embarrassed by the loss of ice
cream or-other refreshments, The
offense is not as seiious as it is
ridiculous, but its one term of exr
ercising the exhriberancc at youth
which does no good to any one
It is Something which every one
considers a weak joke and foolish,
when he is the victim, but which
a few seem to tliinl: is aliit ol tint:
sport.

. ,

RlNNliLL never gets her
athletes ready made. but
to develop these men time is
required. Thisyezn tnrbothbase
ball and track tennis there are a
number of old men to serve as a’
nucleus for strong teams, and the
prospects ale exccllcnt it new
men can be brought out. And
new men who expect to help Grinr
hell in spring athletics should be
gin regular work at once. Work
in the gymnasium will prepare the
way for out door work later.
Much useful training can be done
now, and will result in great gains
for the teams. All candidates for
spring teams for their own good
and the good of the teams should
begin regular work early. Inter-
collegiate contests tvill soon begin
and every legitimate effort should
be excited to make a good showV
mg.

in the right direction, it oratory is
