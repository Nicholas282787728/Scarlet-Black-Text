Propaganda: Gas as hot air

Think about it. What does one do after
graduation? All of us have pondered
this question at one time or another.
Some of us are obsessed with finding an
answer, preferably before graduation
descends. Ask no more, I have the
answer. And I discovered it on the way
to California.

The trip began quietly and innocently
but the inevitable occurred. “We're out
of gas.” 50. about 100 miles into
Nebraska we pulled into a gas station.
.The attendant wandered out, “Want
some gas?” “Uh, yeah, that's why we
stopped." “0.x." He took my key and
began to fill the tank. Then — “Oh,
wow, are you guys from Grinnell?"
“Yeah, we just left.” “I used to go
there. Graduated in '73." My compa-
nion and I stared silently at each other.
I turned to face the attendant. “What
are you doing here?" “Well. see. I was
a, sorry, an English major. But there
weren't any jobs This really isn't bad
work. Get to meet the people and all
that.” He began to sob. “I really do like
it, I‘really do . . Gas dripped from
the tank. I got out of the car, removed

the hose, paid the hopeless wreck of an
attendant and drove off. "Do you think
that's normal? I mean, there can't be
too 'many of those guys floating around.
can there?" “He had shifty eyes. You
can‘t trust people with shifty eyes."
The journey continued.

Rawlins, Wyoming. A truly desolate
place with one iron bridge and several
stingy banks. “Gee. no gas," We pulled
in to a fairly respectable~looking EXXv
on. The attendant lumbered out, As I
saw his desperate attempts at preppy-
dom, a faint sickness raised its head in
my stomach. "Hey, I couldn't help but
notice you fellows have a Grinnell
sticker. Do you go there?" "Yep." That
was all I could get out. The rest of the
conversation centered on how great
Grinnell was. how great Grinnell
Magaline was, how hard it was to find
work as an English major and how hard
it was to get decent preppy clothes in
Wyoming. “Too many farmers." We
paid and left. My companion was white,
shell-shocked, generally bumpy and
even depressed. 'I tried to stay on the in-
terstate. "Listen, it was coincidence,

Jeff Dickey

that's all. There could only be two of
those In the States. Grinnell's a Good
School,"

Our depression lined as we entered
the promised land, California really
isn't as bad as l have sometimes por»
trayed it. I wouldn't raise my children
there. of course, but it is very green. We
felt better after a fewy days in the sun-
shine and soon it was time to return
home. Near the state border we stopped
to get fuel. “Duh, wow, like that's a
Grinnell mark on the machin You
guys must do that place, huh,‘ After
my friend translated for me, I replied.
"We're seniors out on spring break,“
“Seniors. huh. Too bad, man. Gotta find
some work. What a drag." "What ma
jor , “English, man, Uselss. Total-
ly zip. But I'm getting into this. It's ex-
panding.” We left.

Now, loller no moral. A hypothesis —
every gas station attendant on In»
terstate 80 went to Grinnell. They ma-
jored in English. They are still “linding
themselves." However, I am prepared.
I have a Mobil card . _ .

The Divestiture Question

Opinions are bound to differ on ques-
tions like divestment and in many cases
there are solid arguments to support all
of the positions taken, However, Jeff
Dickey's column, “Erasing South
Africa" in the March 6 issue of the 5&3,
presented an argument which is not
consistent with the facts of the case and
may have given many people an union
tunate. and unsupportable, view of the
role of divestment and u.s. corpora»
tions in the struggle for liberation in
South Africa.

Dickey's articles was based on the
assumptions that the U.S. corporations
are doing something for the black pear
ple of South Africa and that “the only
way we can help the blacks in South
Africa is to stay in the country.” The
first assumption is basically false, The
U.S. corporations do train a very small
number of blacks but Corporations are
very rarely forces for progressive
social change. U.S. companies are in
South Africa to maximize their profits.
It is the oppressed black labor force in
South Africa that allowed U.S. com-
panies to earn, until the recession of the
miderOS, at least twice as much for
every dollar invested in South Africa as
they were earning in the world as a
whole.

Dickey claimed that these corpora
tions are training the blacks. But of the
“several million blacks suffering under

I4-

the present regime" (actually the black
workforce alone represents more than
seven million people} only about 70,000
Africans. Asians and coloureds are
even being employed by U.S. com
panies. Both GM and IBM signed the
sadly ineffectual Sullivan Principles.
claiming that they would try to train
black people. But a public statement
signed by Julian Bond (who will be on
campus this weekend), among others,
points out that GM employs four blacks
in salaried positions out of a workforce
of more than 4,500 while lBM has only
four black managers out of almost 1,500
employees.

it is clear that most progressive
moves, like the Sullivan Principles, are
endorsed by u.s. companies to provide
fodder for their public relations can-
nons. However, the corporations‘ guilt
goes far beyond not taking steps to
change South Africa's horrible situa-
tion; they also protect their interest by
actively supporting the apartheid
system. GM continues to supply
Vehicles to the police and military and
secret contingency plans for GM to
cooperate with the South African
government “in the event of civil
unrest" have been uncovered. Our com-
puter companies also sell South
Africa's government the computers it
needs to support its inhuman pass laws,
Many similar cases not cited here are

equally distressing.

Where does all of this leave Grinnell'!
Dickey claimed that if we divest we are
merely "washing our hands of an
unpleasant situation," The fact of the
matter is that Grinnell currently
refuses to even recognize the fact that
its hands are dirty (individual board
members may be aware of our guilt but
the board‘s position, which is all that
really matters, remains the same) and
even if we did realize our guilt, the only
effective measure to absolve that guilt
would be divestment.

Grinnell has consistently voted
against corporate resolutions favoring
human rights, claiming dial they are
poorly written ~ yet to my knowledge
we have not submitted our own pro-
posals. Even if the board wished to ef-
fect change in South Africa. its power
within the corporations in which it in-
vests is negligible

By divesting we can make a social
statement that at least serves to show
solidarity with the oppressed people of
South Africa and will, hopefully, be
heard by the corporations and may help
further movements in other schools. we
have no power in the economic realm
and keeping this in mind, our sym»
pathies should turn to divestment which
is in the social realm where our volce
will be heard.

Scarlet and Black,
