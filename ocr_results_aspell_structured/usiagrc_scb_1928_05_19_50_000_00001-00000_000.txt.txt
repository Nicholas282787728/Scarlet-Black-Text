time, young men's fancies turn toward
love. and this is wholly or partially
true of Friday-and Saturday evenings.
However, on other evenings of the

of mischief worm their weary way
through the inches of solid bone to
lodge themselves firmly in the inner-
most recesses of thc toil-worn cere-
bellum.

clilred Prof. C. E, Payne to the senior-
class at senior chapel services yestel'r
day morning.

He continued to say, "The Gi'inuell
Spirit is a wonderful thing. I have
seen students trans mined by it, and
I have watched these students put it
into their lives after their college
days have passed." He said that he
did not propose to scoff at the Grin-
uell Spirit or to wax sentimental over
it, but in twenty years that he had
observed it (is 21 professor he had
watched its wonderful development.

In developing his topic, Professor
Payne explained how he had come into
possession of a "l'ountlrl-ohiu" letter
of a graduating class of fifteen or-
twenty years ago, By thorough
study and knowledge of the progress
of this class of twenty members frcnr
the time of their graduation to the
present time, Professor Payne hoped
to forecast the success and failure of
individuals in the present class.

The speaker enumerated the various

noted that in every case the work
done by these people was u-ortlrwlrile
though not phenomonal and that ev-
ery person was a substantial and re-
spected ci , n of his or her commune
ity.

A remarkable fact that Professor
Payne noted was that there was not a
trace of bitterness or c, icism up.

troubles in their fami .

A bit of humor was injected when
the speaker declared that the wonder
always grew how these people were
ever able to graduate accor us to the
tales they told of their undergraduate
days at Crlnnell. He quoted several
extracts from the letters in which
they told of their pranks.

In one letter only was any trace of
literary interest shown. The rest
made no mention either directly or by
inference of intimate contact with
literary works.

Professor Payne mentioned James
Norman Hall as an undergraduate stu~
dent at Grinnell. He declared that
Hall was an excellent representative
of the type Crirmell produces.

Development From Love To Warfare

Is Attributed to Spring And Thought

Spring has Come, and with it the
thoughts of warfare have permeated
the minds of the young men about the

original so and so finds a miniature
Niagara streaming down his neck,
Without any thought on the matter.
he moves to a safe distance from such
and such a window, and the mlnd be-
gins to function.

Here we must take up another line
of reasoning, if such it might be call-
ed, The eye of so and so sees a Lucky
Tiger bottle in a nearby ash can. This
fact is transmitted to the active brain,
and the hand picks up and fondles
the smooth glass, and the realization
comes that this object would go
through more glass with the greatest
ease. In a short time. the first war-
rior finds himself picking glass from
his ears and eyes, and the real wor-
fare begins.

Ferhaps this carefully Worked out
analysis explains the actions noticed
around the dormitories the last few
evenings. At any rate, it explains the
development from love to Warfare,

The play centered about the person-

flattery of her suitor, Jacque. until
she was forced to listen to the dice

excited conversation with the latter,
she was glad to accept Jacqu'e proA
posal after certain humorous stipula-
Lions.

The characters were )\‘ell»clIOsell
and took their parts in' a way that
showed not only their understanding
of the French language, but also of
French mannerisms. Thcy acted with
a great deal of ease, saying their lines
with remarkable fluency and e. res-
sion. No character was supcrior to
any other character as the roles were
all \\'ell»ncted, Perhaps special men-

SCIENCE CLUB PICNIC.
Science club will have its final pic-
nic of the year on Monday. The sei-
entists will meet ill. Blair Hall, Where
cars will leave for south Westfield at
5:30 and e p. m. Officers for next
year will be elected,

 

morning at Lincoln. Nebraska, repre-
sentatives from Crinnell, Drake. Okla-
homa A. and M., and Washington uni-
versity met. The decision of these
four schools was to continue the name,
policies and traditions of the Missouri
Valley conference.

Following their decision to cooper-
ate in continuing the conference a per—
manent board of directors was elected.
John C. Truesdale, Grinnell’s repre-
sentative, was elected president of the
board. '

All conference enterprises will con-
tinue including an invitation track
meet at St. Louis it was announced in
a special dispatch to the SCARLET
AND BLACK. "

Under the terms of the reorganiza-
tion. no other schools will be admitted
at present. The present personnel of
the conference will necessitate the ad-
dition of at least two schools in the
future to insure shorter trips and a
more comprehensive schedule for the
conference. Six schools seem to be a
desirable number for an intercollegiate
competitive standpoint.

The Six schools that withdrew from
the Missouri valley conference will be
known as the Big Six conference and
will he composed of Nebraska. Kansas.
Ames, Oklahoma li., Kansas Aggies'
and} Missouri.

The withdrawal of these s'nv schools
was announced in the newspapers on
September 24, 1927, and official au<
nouncemcnt was made to the athletic
department of Grilmell and other
members on September 27. Since that
time there have been numerous rumors
concerning the organization of a con—
ference that would include all the for-
mer members except Grinuell and
Washington. However, these reports
were unfounded.

The Missouri Valley conference was
organized in 1907 with Washington,
Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska as the
charter members. Grimlell became a
member in 1918. Nebraska has made
several atempts to enter the Big Ten,
unsuccessfully. Iowa formerly bcv‘ ._
longed to the Missouri valley. leaving
to join the Big Ten in 1917. The con-
ference consists of three bodies, ﬁrst,
the conference of presidents and gov»
erning boards. which is the supreme
authority; second, the conference of
faculty representatives, who must not
be connected with their department of
athletics in their several institutions;
and third. the conference of directors
of athletics. In order to become valid,
questions of policy must be ratiﬁed by
the conference of faculty representa-
tives and the presidents.

Prof. E. D. Strong has been the fac-
ulty representative for Grinnell in all
negotiations that have taken place.
He and Mr. Truesdale represented
Grim-fell at Lincoln yesterday.
