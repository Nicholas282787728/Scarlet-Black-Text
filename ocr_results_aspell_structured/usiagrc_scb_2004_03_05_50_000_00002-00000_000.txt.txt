“A few people are bound to not show up,"
said Nelson. "The show is stunning—the sets
are spectacular and the actors fantastic. ifthere
are emptyseats, i am going to cry."

Alternate funding

This springs Alternative Break participants,
a motivated group dedicating their spring break
to community service prorects in communities
across the country, have had to increase choir of.
forts in order to make their trips a reality. A lack
of funding has forced students to seek out f1»
nanciai resources in creative ways.

While Alternative Break is largely funded by
the Community service center budget, those
funds are not sufficient to finance the needs of
the participants. Reduced availability ofoutside
funds from sources such as the student Activi.
ties Fund have left many student groups pressed

AN EMPTY

PAHROF

for adequate funding, and Alternative Break is
no exception. In addition to fewer ﬁnancml rc.
sources Alternative Break is sponsoring more
ttips this year, eight to be exact, than in past years.
Not that anyone is complaining.

The program didnt like how in other years
so many students who wanted to do servrce had
[0 be turned away," said coordinator Rose Wilt
sun ’06. “We made 2 decision this year bccaus:
there was such great leaders and such a demand
ro send more trips."

The result was the vast majority ofapplicants
being placed on a trip.

“Everyone that applied this year, on time, was
offered to be a participant on one of the trips,"
said coordinator Kmdra Banchy ‘06. “The last
couple of years we were seeing [approximately]
25 to 50 percent of applicants being turned
down, which has hindered our program be.
cause fewer people apply [when] they've been
turned down in the. past and theyve heard of
other people being turned down

Now. however, with 80 participants, mak
ing this spring's trips happen has been a finan—
cial challenge. Yet, in some respect affordability
has always been a challenge

“As a growing program there was never quite
enough money,” said Community Service Co»
ordinatotArny Graves. “We were always sort of
scrapping for money. We’ve never quit: been

Saferyconcems pertaining to transportation
have been a factor in driving up program costs
where they would otherwise be quite low. Al the
program’s inception costs were limited almost
solely to gas money. As interest iiicteascd larger
and safer modes oftranspottation, such as vans,
charter buses, trains and now airplanes, were
more widely used

Trip leaders try to keep costs manageable in
oil aress. The programs emphasis on living simr
ply—for example, sleeping on gym ﬂoors and
making meals as agroup rather than eating out—
helps cut spending. However, because the ma.
jority ofexpenscs come from transportation and

food costs, SGA funds are not an option for
supplementing these needs This is particularly
a problem this year because of the loss offinan.
ciai resources.

Essentially the Community service center
gives us a certain amount and participants put
in a certain amount and everything else has to
be fundraiscd," said coordinator David Wylie
‘06, “so this year we're fund raising."

Alt. Break participants have turned to such
fund raising tactics as writing letters, collecting
in the dorms, cashing in cement, doing chores
for faculty, and are even hoping to use the
Phonathon to solicit alumni donations.

“Everyone is working on it and everyone is
turning to basically every source that is poten—
tially available," said Wilson.

one thing the program prides itselfon is it's
accessibility to trudenis. Low participation fets~
this year the fee was $1504cspccially when com»
pared to those at outer schools, are emphasized
as a means to encouragestudents to apply to the
program. Additionally, Alt. Break has worked to
obtain ﬁnancial aid for students who are low on
money.

”Tom Crady was gracious enough to fund
students who could not afford the participation
fee,” said Kendra Banchy 'oo. “ifstudents need
financial aid they can apply to our program and
from Tom Cindy’s money we are able to fund
their requests."

However, the groups still has a ways to go to
meet their goals for this year. Anyone interested
in helping out Alternative Break is encouraged
to contact Amy Graves [gravesai or Alternative
Break [altbtk] for nrote information.

Tuesday afternoon. As ofwednesday morning.
the water system was working properly and ac.
cess to ARI-I bathrooms was restored.
