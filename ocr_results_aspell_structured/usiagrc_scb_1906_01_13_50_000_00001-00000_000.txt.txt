A POLlCE REPORTER.

Jacob Riis Will Tell Some Interesting

Facts Concerning His Experiences ,
as a News Collector.

From a common street beggar with-
outhome or friends to the ioremost
citizen in America’s greatest city is
no short step, but it is not an imposs-
ihle one either. Thirty years ago
Jacob Riis was a dirty tramp on the
streets of New York; today he is the
man m o s t looked up to by all
publicspirited men and women of
that place He is not without en-
emies however. No good man is. For
justnslung as Graft and Tammany
tiger existin New York so long will
Riis and his associates meet trials and
hardships in the work they have at-
tempted. Early in his career Riis
recognized that the toleratlon 0f the
vile tenements, saloons, dives and
criminal dens which infested lower
New York was due to the evil con-
dition of the city’s politics, and he im-
mediately set about to explore the
vicious burden under which the city
labored He used every opportunity
which his ﬁrst position as police ie--
porter on the New York Sun oirererl
him to write up the things which he
saw in the slums and the reasons for
tileirexistence. Whatheaccomplish-
ed by it was little, directly, but his
persistance soon attracted the atten-
tion of men of more influence and ﬁll-
ally he Was given a chance to demon-
strate the truth of his statements.
He did it Very clearly.

The things which Jacob A. Rils
started to do thirty years ago were to
tear down the crowded tenement
houses of New York and put in their
places small parks and gardens; to see
that sensible tenament house laws
were passed and enrorced; to see that
free police station lodging houses were
done away With, and to be sure there
were enough public schools ior all the
children of New York. A big task to
undertake, was’t it, when we consider
that these tenement houses, poor as
they were. and the ground upon which
they stood were extremely Valuable,
and then that the men who owned
them had a stronger pull by far with
with the city council than he did? It
seems nearly impossible that anything

could have been accomplished, Tire
iaith which removed mountains for
this man was the sheer bulldog
“sticktoitiveness” which he showed
in everything ire undertoo,
neversaydie spirit with wll
man who knew whereor he spoke
worked. There has been nothing
mystical in Jacob nus» success.

DR, WILLIAM R. HARPER,

The Late president of Chicago univer-
siiy is Eulogizcd by Dean Main at

the chapel Service.

The recent death of Dr. William It.
Harper, president or Chicago Univer-
sity,served as an occasion ior Dean
Main on Friday morning, to pay trib-
ute to the great educator, organi r
and university president. The un-
timely demise oitlrisdemocraticschol»
ar isa cause ior sorrow throughout
the entire country. Dean Main comr
merited on a few or the characteristics
which made the man respected and
honored by all who were acquainted
With him or his work.

"President Harper was an extraor-
dinary man in the strict sense of the
term. He was a creative force in the
educational world As a university
president he was in a class by lrimseli
——unique in many respects from all
others. He understood periectly the
material demands, and yet at the
same time recognized spiritual ideals
in a remarkable way, He was a cour-
ageous, heroic and undaunted man
even in the face or death; however. as
did not yield a single inch to the grim
reaper but iought it out to the very
end. Atthc time or the operation
about a year ago, he expressed the do
sire to live until January 15, 1906. By
tirattimc theUniversrtybudgctwould
be completed and he could feel that
his work was ﬁnished. He planned
his work tor the year and has rejected
the use of all opiates until the very
last so that he could ﬁnish his labors
with unimpaired mental powers.

In the iirst place ire developed a pub-
lic university By means‘oi the uni
vcrsity extension department and the
system of “quarters,” the work or the
university was made c o n tin cans
throughout the year. By these meth-
ods hundreds of people were able to
geta taste oi university work who
would have been prevented otherwise.
Next, the University was diﬂerentia»
ted into the Senior and Junior colleges.
In tile iormer, the work is elective, in
the latter required. Tlrirdly, tllees-
tablislrmerrt of an independent insti-
tution llllliampered by external inﬂu~
ences, gave pre-eminence to the mid-
dle West. Lastly, his greatest work,
and one which is not yet done, is the
practical expression which he gave to
the small or independent college. Tire
permanency of the independent col-
lege was recognized by him.

“President Harper’s spirit will have
an inliuence in the middle West (or all
time to come. lie was not all educa-

OUR SOCIETY COLUMN,

A Weekly Review oi the programs and
Events in the Iowa Collegc
Literary Societies.

The Institute program Wednesday
evening was given entirely by upper
class men and was fully up to the
high standard that has been main»
tained throughout the year. As a
large number of new men have re
cently been admitted to membership
it was deemed ﬁtting that some of
the ideals and aims of the Society be
placed beiore them. The Inaugural
address by the newly elected President
Knowlton was the ﬁrst number. The
Society, he said, wanted and was get-
tingrnenwhn wouldwork. Theobject
was not to train winning orators and
debaters, but to give every member
thorough practice in prepared and ex-
tempcraoeons speaking, and in par-
liarmentary law. This speech was
ably followed by De Haan on the sub-
ject oi “Institute Programs.” The
success 01 the meetings or the society,
he thought, demnded upon the pro-
grams and upon those put upon the

programs. Members must cooperate

with the program committee.

Four class programs and inter-socie-
ty prograur are now scheduled. The
subject or “Business Meetings" was
next handled in an interesting man-
ner by ex-President Williams, Beneﬁt
from them is obtained only by prao
tice and experience. New menshould
take part, Tire time to begin work is
now, and the place is here. He sug<
gested throwing the Society into'a
Senatein order to obtain Parliamen-
tarv practice.

Worth closed the program with a
discussion of “criticism” lrow to give
it and to take without ollcnse and
how to improve by it. lie suggested
the novel plan or dividing tlle society
intosides and choosingdebating teams
irom opposite sides as a moans of in»
creasing the rivalry and interest in
debates. As the Scarlet Quartotic,
who were to have furnished one or
the numbers of the program, were de-
layed in arriving, they were heard
with pleasure at the beginning of the
business meeting.

CHIKESTUMATIHA.

The ﬁrst meeting or the society for

ary work this winter. The feature of
