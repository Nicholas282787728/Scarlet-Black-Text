Game ShOW emCee or assassm

BY Coum‘lev SHEEHAN

Oddball entries in a beloved authors
work are like soggy 'carmellotta bars in the
dehall. You know that an excess of gooey
caramel should knock some points off that
particular slice, but you just can’t say no-to
an extra dose of corn syrupy charm. As, a
mere screenwriter until his directorial de-
but in 2008’s Synecdoche, New York, (re-
viewed here last year) Charlie Kaufman’s
auteur status in Hollywood is admirable.
Films like "Being John Malkovich," “EEC?
nal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and
“Adaptation" have ﬁrmly lodged his name
among 'the greats. Although all distinc-
tively marvelous, Kaufman’s work coheres
around his hrainy idiosyncrasies: ProtagOr
nists tend to be neurotic, ﬂuszered regu—
lar Joes with a metaphysical twist. Female
characters are played with unusual grungi-
ness by otherwise esteemed hard hitters or
horties (Meryl Streep, Kate Winsier, Came
eron Diaz). Chronological time is forsaken
for disconcerting temporal lurches and spit
raling bouts of depression regularly assail
our heroes.Jokes about the banality of sand
and “Flowers for Algernon" somehow soar.

For _a collection of ”different” mov~

-ies, Confessions ofa Dangerous Mind is
even more different. The directorial debut
of George Clooney, the suave salt-and»
pepper actor took Kaufman’s Laws, heaved
them into a biopic blender and poured out
a smoothie that ‘could have been smoother.
At the time of its release, when the film
opened to pretty ok reviews but downright
lousy reception at the box office, Kaufman
was pissed. He claimed that Clooney had
butchered_his brilliant script, the wacky
tale of Chuck Barris, a real life guy who
wrote pop songs in the ’60s that you’d still
recogni1e today, single-handedly launched
the heyday of game shows in the '70s and
had a habit of telling people that he was a
super secret killer for the CIA. He wrote
all this down in a memoir, and Kaufman,
no doubr seeing the potential for uncomr
fortahle jokes and barely controlled mental
instability, ventured to bring the story to
life. Alas, no one went to see this movie. So
had was the turnout. in fact, that Miramax
retreleased the film the next year, complete
with a guilt trip advertising campaign that
said things like, “You owe it to yourself to
see this movie that George Clooney direct-
ed, because you didn't the first time." Be-

Confession:
of a Dan er

ing the Kaufmanite that i was as a young n,
I was pissed at this movie too. But upon '
retwatching it rEcently,I realized that it is
viciously good.

>Fir$t off,Sam Rockwell plays Barris. If
you saw Moon in Harris at rhe end oflasr
semester, you know that his rumpled every»
day good looks don’t need to glisten in or-
der for him to shine. On top of Rockwell’s
skills, Michael Cera plays rykeesize Harris,
a kid who gleefully solicits a girl to lick his
junk, with the enticing line “it tastes like
strawberries." Cloonely rounds up a crew
of Atlisr friends for the test of the cast—
Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts, Maggie
Gyllenhaal. Even Mari Damon and Brad
Pitt make cameos as contestants on “The
Dating Game (they don’t get picked). In»
(erspliced with real interviews with Dick
Clark and other game show hlg nmers who
knew Harris, the deeply saturated cinemas
tography gleams with the kitschy glitz of
the ’70s. Dark, heady, zany: Confessions
may not exhibit the self-awareness that
,Kaufman painstakingly writes into his
striprs. hut such an unabashed ‘rude rings -
true with its subject: a game show emcee
who aspired to be an assassin.
