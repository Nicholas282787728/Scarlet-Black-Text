Dedication oi the New Gymnar
Slum.

"the unusually large crowd at
the reception given last evening
at the new Gymnasium, in con»
llCCIloti wttli the tlcdicatoi-y exer-
cises, was eloquent as a token of
appreciation on the part of the
students for the magniﬁcent build-
ing given by Miss Rand.

The guests began to gather in
the main l'tsomrmthe Gymnasium
properfrslloi'tlybetore 8:00, where
they were received by Miss Rand
and by Pres. and Mls, Gates. The
room and the running track above
were soon ﬁlled.

The ﬁrst exercise of thc brief
but interesting program was the
singing by thewcmen, oi the Gym~
nasium‘song, written [or the occar
sion by Miss Florence Fonda, ’98.
and set to music by Prof. Cole.
After this Prof. Geo. D. Herron,
on behalt of the donor. in an ap-
propriate speech in which hi:
spoke appreciatively of the lives
of the two men for whom thc
building was erected as a memo-
rial. presented the building to the
Trustees. President Gates, in a
few felimtous remarks, gracefully
accepted it. Prof. Patrick, of the
State University, then delivered a
short address which was listened
to with closest attention. Prof.
Patrick spoke of the necessity for
athletics in college lite, and quot-
ed statistics to show the superior»
ity of gymnasium work to out-of-
door sports. The speaker espec-
ially dwelt upon the good tortune
of Iowa College in having so good
a friend as Miss Rand.

Miss Sara Nollen, prcsident of
the senior class, spoke for the
women of the institution, express-
ing their hearty appreciation for
the gift so muniﬁcently bestowed
and for the opportunities forphySr
ical culture that it would furnish.

On behalf of the Athletic Union
Mr. Harold L Beyer delivered a
short address of felicitation, Cori»
gratulating the women upon their
good fortune, comparing the new
Gymnasium with the basement
accommodations near by that by
courtesy have been called the
“men's gym."

Rev. L. 1.. West of Winona.
Minnesota, closed this part of the
program with an eloquent address
and offered the dedicatory prayer.

After the conclusion of the
speaking a very charming teature
or the program occurred when
Miss Annie Raymond gave an
exliibllion of Indian Club swing-
ing which was one of the prettiest
exercises of a similar kind ever
seen here.

The exercises were in perfect
taste and interesting. They very
ﬁttingly celebrated the opening
of this new and important addi-
tion to the equipment of Iowa
College. The newbuilding is one
that any college might be proud
of and will always stand as a
memorial both to its donor and to
the men in whose memory it was
erected.

A Word from Dr. Gladdenr
COLUMBUS. OHIO,
Nov. 28, 1897.
MY DEAR DR. GATES:

I have the copy of SCARLET
nun BLACK with the picture and
description of Miss Rand's new
Gymnasium. It is a most noble
gift. I do not know for whichI
feel the more thankfuliwhether
that the young women of ion-a
College have such a blessing cone
terred on them,—or that a woman
like Miss Rand ﬁnds it in her
heart to confer it. The two can~
not well be separated.

Surely those two—the mother
and the daughterimust be very
happy women. God bless them
and ﬁll their lives with his bounty.

I wish that I could be with you
at the Dedication; but my joy will
be with you!

Yours truly,
WASHINGTON GLADDEN.
