ders, a junior, has lived in Papua
New Guinea for 19 years. When
asked why she chose to study
here, she said, "I guess I had
itchy feet and wanted to go
somewhere different, I just
looked at Cambridge, Colorado,
James Cook (in Australia), and
Grinncll. Grinnell was by far the
friendliest just from the corre-
spondence. I didn't really con-
sider where it was." Like
Nousheen, Carole decided to try
to be really independent, as she
was always under the “protective
umbrella" of her family. How
ever, she discovered that she had
relatives here in Buffalo, New
York, "after I came here!“

Carole recalled her first few
months here at Grinnell: "I was
new. I was excited. You make
some wonderful friendships in
those days. After a while, I be»
came a little depressed because it
wasn't as perfect as it seemed to
be during the ﬁrst few months.
After the initial excitement has
worn off, you have to deal with
real life. I noticed this cycle as
an SA last year. I think it's a
freshman experience." Her plans
include going back to the South
Paciﬁc to teach for a while. She
considers Papua New Guinea her
home. What is it like there?
"Very exotic. I had jungle ﬁve

Easy Rider tackles
American hypocrisy

by Brian Strause
That they do not respect in any
degree,
Who despise their job, their
destiny,
Speak jealously of them that
are free,
Do what they do to be nothing
more
Than something they invest
in.
-- Bob Dylan

Directed by the warped, yet
brilliant Dennis Hopper, Easy
Rider investigates the hypocrit-
ical standards of freedom
embraced by American society.
Following the journey from
California to the Deep South of
two hippie cocaine dealers who
have just hit the mother load,
Easy Rider paints a picttue of
America that you won't find at
the tourist bureau, Racked with
cultural racism and infested with
impossible dreams, America falls
on the weight of its own ideal-
ism. Wyatt (Peter Fonda)
proudly wears the American flag
because he respects the ideal that
"freedom's what it's all about."
Unfortunately the idealism sur-
rounding the American Dream is
a far cry from the realism that IS
the American Dream. Sure ev—
eryone is created equal, but when
it comes down to black and
white. long hair and short hair,
this principle is abandoned,

The ﬁlm's antagonists, Wyatt
and Billy (Dennis Hopper), are
cast in the traditional outlaw/hero
mold. Their connection to the
heroes of the Wild West is first
evident in their names, deriva-
tives of those gunslinging
heroes. Wyatt Earp and Billy the
Kid. Instead of horses our heroes
travel across the country on mo»

torcycles. smoking joints instead
of gulping whiskey. Signifi-
cantly, Wyatt and Billy's travel
plans directly contradict the natu-
ral westward progression of their
predecessors. Their backwards
journey to the East is simply
representative of the backwards
and warped society they en-
counter.

Jack Nicholson offers the
film's greatest performance as
GCOrge Hanson, an alcoholic
lawyer picked up by Wyatt and
Billy on their way to New Orr
leans. George serves as a kind of
savior to Wyatt and Billy as he
springs them from jail with their
hair intact, Wyatt and Billy
bring their new found friend
along with them, as they forge
onward to Mardi Gras. As the
three men camp outside a seem—
ingly patriotic town, complete
with an upside-down American
ﬂag hung from Ben Franklin's.
George explains in one of cin-
ema's most cutting speeches on
the hypocrisy of America, why
Wyatt and Billy scare the genera
public. George rips to the root
of the prevailing ethos when he
notes, "Don‘t ever tell anyone
they‘re not free, because they‘re
gonna get real busy killin' and
maimin' to prove to you that
they are'

Easy Rider may wallow in 60s
morality and hippie lingo, but
nonetheless its theme is timeless.
Humorous, dramatic, and tragic
this film takes on America, leav-
ing its traditional notions a
twisted mass of metal, smolder-
ing along the open road.

Lonely are the Brave

by Georgia Dcntel

Lonely are the Brave is a very
different type of "classic ﬁlm"
than is On (lie Waterfront or
Adams Rib Its director, David
Miller is not as well known as
either Kazan or Cukor, and
although the cast (made up of
Kirk Douglas, Gena Rowlands,
Walter Matthau, Carol O'Connor
(All in the Family), and George
Kennedy) is a strong one, the
film‘s success does not rest on
cast performance alone.

What, then, has given this
piece such a good audience over
the years'.7 Certainly, the story of
the proverbial last cowboy drar
matically pitted against the on-
slaught of civilization, is strong:
certainly Kirk Douglas gives one
of the best performances of his
career; certainly elements of em

 
 
 
 
 
   
 

pathy and suspense command at-
tention; yet none of these factors,
by themselves, make for great-
ness. The answer seems to be
found. rather, in the "mix" , the
sum of these parts. It is as these
components are blended that the
film takes on a life of its own.
Credit for this blend and for
selection and treatment of the
powerful script must be given to
director Miller. In Lonely are the
Brave he gives viewers a rather
rare opportunity to observe a
skilled craftsman's influence in
combining script. cast, and

 

interpretation to achieve
maximum result. 1962, l07
