Keeping the faith
Christian Fellowship members cite goals, problems

“We try to bring in speakers and
provide ior the needs at our
chapter. li a small groups having
trouble making progress in their
Bible study, we'll try to help the
leader with planning and support
We set out the themes (or the large
group meetings and guide the
direction the group takes," council
member Meg Litts said.

The Fellowship is supported by
Tony Hershey, an lntervarsity
sta“ worker, who also Coordinated
chapters at lSU in Ames and Cen-
tral College in Fella.

The variety oi activities means a
lot at work for the council, but
members reel the diversity oi oar
tivities is one of the strengths of the
program “i iirst started going to
small group, and eventually
became more interested in being a
part oi the iellowship. Second
semester [of his freshman year] I
began going to large group, and
i've been going ever since," said
Jim Caccamo, a sophomore and
one of the Fellowship's leading
musicians, “Most oi the people
who are searching for answers go
to the smallrgroup Bible studies.
Largergroup meetings are mostly
ior iellowship and support. It's not
easy to be a Christian, especially
here, and it’s really helpful to know
that other people ieel the same
way you do.“

"People say that if you come In
Grinnell [College] a Christla_n,_
you’ll either trash your faith or
become really radical, and 1 think
that's true,” said sophomore
Kirsten Johnson. “Grinnell College
is not an easy place m be a Chris-
tian. Grinnellians don't always
practice their liberal ‘do your own
thing‘ attitude. To me, being
liberal means being openrrninded
and willing to listen to other points
of view. There are people here who

will not listen to my point oi view.
' And that really hurts.”

Although not all members oi
Christian Fellowship encounter
hostility to their Christian liiestyle,
Rob Killlon ieels that there is a
common misconception oi Chris-
tians as being “holler-thanrthou,"
“And uniortunately. there are
some Christians like that," said
Killion. “But actually it’s the op
posite: we’re Christians because
we know we sin, and we know it's
impossible not to. All that being
Christian means is acknowledging
that you Can’t get out oi that hole."

One oi the goals oi Christian
Fellowship is to help members ieel
more comiortable with their Chris-
tianity, to oiier support to them
during times oi need. They do not
ieel comiortable with the
stereotypical view oi Christians as
closed-minded, and do not see
themselves as elitist. Both Killion
and Caccamo ieel that Christian
Fellowship is neglected at Grin-
nell, that it needs to become more
prominent.

Caccamo said, “it
out oi the ordinary to hear about
Christian Fellowship, and it should
be out oi the ordinary NOT to hear
of Christian Fellowship. I think a
lot oi people don’t even know what
we're about,”

Killian would like to see Chris»
tianity discussed more on campus.
“Ideally, the goal oi Christian
Fellowship would be to let every
single person at Grinnell College
know who Jesus Christ is and what
he said so that they can make an
intelligent choice. students
Shouldn't make a decision ior lack
of information.” _ _

Christians or all denominations
are welcome at Fellowship and br-
ing with them a great diversity oi

____—_.Christian heritage. The group

avoids potential conilicts oi belieis

by relying heavily on the Scrip-
tures “We don’t address issues as
such. We're interested in what the
Blble says, in iinding out the Word
oi God,” said Johnson, She leads a
small-group Bible study, acting as
iacilitator to keep the group mow
ing and to prevent discussions
irom getting oir track “We learn
about Scripture together so we can
think about it on our own.”

In the iinal analysis, Christian
Fellowship is a growing organiza
tion with lots oi plans ior the
iuture. The Executive Council is
considering bringing some iilms
and concerts to campus and hopes
to reach out to the community
through missions during this come
ing year, as well as to become
more prominent on campus.
Sophomore and smallrgroup leader
Eva Gakonyo said, “Feel iree to
reach out to Christians 7 were not
as weird as we somehow seem to
be.“

Yugoslavian journalist finds US.

by Kamerine Gfeller
What would your view of the
world be it you had visited 70 Conn
tries? perhaps, like Nebojsa
Magdeski, who has experienced a
liietime oi travel as a ioreign Corr
respondent ior Yugoslavia's wire
service TANJUG, you would think
that people are the same
everywhere. Magdeski, currently
TANJUG'S ioreign aiiairs editor,
visited Grinnell on a trip to observe
small-town life in America.
Magdeski Came to the United
States through an exchange pro-
gram which seeks to expose inter-
national journalists to the
American way oi liie. Magdeski,
who is particularly interested in in-
ternational relations and educa-
tional institutions, visited not only
the college but also the city's
juniors and Senior-high schools. He
said that he is really enjoying this
“exploratory" visit in which he is
observing, rather than reporting
on the people and culture oi the
United States.
Magdeski hails irom a jour-
nalistic iamily, and aiterspending,
eight years as a reporter ol the
Lebanese war, he is Considered an‘

expert on the M|ddle East. For
Magdeski, the most rewarding
aspects oi journalism are the op-
portunities for travel and the

However, Magdeski said, “i
have seen none oi the anarchy and

To rectiiy such misconceptions,
Magdeski suggested that there be

people “should be judged by how
they do their duties" and not by
their decisions in their personal
lives. in general, Magdeski ielt
that people have more privacy in
Yugoslavia than they do in the
United States.

Magdeski concluded that
although “people may be me same
everywhere, their customs,

An exposure to the unique oiier-

believes.

much as she wanted to. She had an
obsession with food and her whole
day seemed somehow to be
centered around it. ”If i would in
duige in one bad thing, then it
would ruin the rest of that day,”
she said, and afterwards she would
“gorge at any opportunity." Such a
hinge would be iollowed by exer-
cise.

Although several ol her friends
expressed concern. it wasn't until
her sophomore year at Grinnell
that she sought help. She went to
the Mental Health Center because
she ”just couldn‘t right anymore."
At that time, she was not aware of
all the health risks involved in her
behavior. Visiting the center, she
claims, “cured” her. Yet. Andrea
{eels vulnerable and has ”a sort of
fear of falling back into it."

Andrea also said that she is not
by any means an exception at
Grinnell, She believes that ”more
than halioi women on Campus,
have som sort oi eating
disorder."
