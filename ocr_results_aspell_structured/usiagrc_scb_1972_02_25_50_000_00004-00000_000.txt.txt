T he 'S‘c'arlet and Black“

Ask For While Racial Awareness

To The Editors:

Approximately three weeks ago
Russ McGregor contacted four while
Grinnell students to act as a sounding
board of white attitudes toward the
cos proposal for a black cultural
library. We attended a meeting with
library staff members on February
10, and a meeting with members at
the Library Committee on Thursday,

February l7 .
our position in respect to the li-

brary proposal was observational
rather than an operational one. How
ever, in expressing our views at the
meetings, we soon realized that we
had acquired participant biases
which clearly favored the CBS posi-
tion. Therelore, we have at present
more than a cursory interest in the
actions and reactions which
occurred last Thursday (Feb 17).
Because we recognize these biases.
we will not and cannot censue the
actions ol the parties involved in
this dispute. Rather we will attempt
to clarity what has now become a
stagnant and muddled situation.

The CBS proposal, as we under
stand it, was as follows:

That a black cultural library be
established in what is now the Corns
plex of offices just south of the
.Registrar (this includes Dean Wall's
office).

That the black cultural library cons
tain as much of the library’s current
collection of material related to
black Culture- e., books, periodi-
cals, artwork, music, and arti»
facts-~as possible,

That steps be taken to increase the
library’s collection of black culture
materials; especially books and
periodicals.

These were in essence the CBS
“demands.” However, included in
the outlined proposal were such
items as listening rooms, micronlm
viewing tacilities, and other
“related media materials.”

As we understand the situation, the
CBS proposal was meant to suggest
a focus for discussion once the con
cept of a black cultural library had
been accepted by the administratio .
The proposal was not a list or co
crete demands, but rather sug
tions to be discussed once adefi ite
commitment to the idea of a black
cultural library had been estab-
lished. As Russ stated quite clearly
in the February 17 meeting, "The
concept rather than the institution of
the program is what is important,"

It was obvious that CBS fully under—
stood the need to speak to specifics.
However, the meeting with the Lie
brary Committee was instituted
solely to obtain their support for the
concept or the black library. Subr
sequent meetings would have probed
specilic implementation or the pro‘
posal.

Several concerns seem to have been
uppermost in the minds of certain
members of the Library Committee:

(a) The degree to which a library
should compartmentalize specilic
fields of study (i.e., if there is a
black library, why not a separate
economics library?)

(b) Specilic details involved in the
implementation or the library pro-
posal (e.g., linancing, re-cataloging
books).

(c) Allocation ol available library
space (there are plans at present to
move past periodicals lrom down—
town to Hurling basement).

(d) A proposal by the library stall
to locate the black library lnthe 20th
Century Rodin, thus providing more
open exposure ol black culturalma—
terial to the student body,

These are all valid and necessary
questions. However, these questions
were beyond the scope of the Feb
i7 meeting. Basically, CBS was
seeking a commitmentna beginning
--ti~om which specilic implementar
tion could have evolved ll was more
important to answer “Should we
do it", than to ask “How should we
do ltl” The admi stration seems
to believe that the two questions are
inextricably linked and that CBS is
demanding a library ilill~biown lrom
the budget We do not believe this to
be the case. While CBS wasadamant
on the concept, they were flexible on
its implementation However, by
concentrating on technicalities ol
implementation, the administration
effectively abrogated any accord
which may have been reached cons
cerning the “concept” of the black
cultural library. We emerged from
the Feb, 1'7 meeting without even the
bare bones oi a commitment.
it was only natural that blacks
should perceive this as but another
manifestation of bureaucratic hyper
crisy and inaction However, we do
not feel that the action taken by CBS
on Thursday night was conducive to
reaching accord on the library. This
action tended to conluse the issue,
both in respect to Students and to the
administration, Perhaps CBS should
make more of lili effort to educate the
campus community to the validity or
its demands.

That the necessity for such educa-
tion exists may be perceived lrorn
comments such as several of those
quoted at the end at the Feb. 18 SALE
articl BS activities in the Twe
tieth-Ce tury Room most not be co
strued as :i social outing. While the
action itself may have had ”A very
social atmosphere,” the motivation
behind it was deadly serious It is
time ior white students to give equal-
ly serious consideration to the racial
context of their “Grinnell expert,
ence,"

For their enlightenment and educa-
tion, white students should seek out
black students and attempt to comr
municate with them concerning the
racial atmosphere at this college.

The issue (if the black cultural lir
brary is only the tip or the iceberg
of black sentiment at Grinnell Colo
lege. A genuine concern about racial
issues and preiudices must develop
here, replacing the liberal guilt
complex endemic to the white elite
not attending this institution,

Bemoans loss 0i Cultural Relics

To The Editors:

The student body ofGrlnnell should
be notilied that a great tragedy has
befallen the campus. One of the col-
lege’s priceless cultural centers
has been desecrated beyond recognir
tion, I am referring oi courseto that
veritable treasure house or gralliti
once located in the Norris pit.
h magnilicent collection olinsightlul
quotes has been buried under a coat
of paint. As a result of this sacrir
ligious act, our children will lorever
be denied exposure to the intellec-
tually stimulating words olthe great,
unrecognized philosophers or our
time. The pit is used as a study area
and the words or the prophets that
were written on the basement wzills
were conduslve to its overall acar
demic atmosphere. Yes triends,
modern technology has struck again
translorming a comlortablc, homey
room into a barren cell wholly un»
lit tor the lurthoring ol anyone's
education. I am sure that the entire
campus joins those ol us who live
in Norris in our sorrow over tile
college’s loss of this shrine

Students, tired of their drab, every
day existence and wishing to seek

inspiration from the “old masters”,
pilgrim-aged lrom all over the coir
lege (some hiking the entire length
or our sprawling campus through
Iowa’s ice and show) just to stare in
utter rapture as they gratefully abr
sorhed the sage wisdom of theiran-
ceslors, Some would contemplate [or
hours on end such theories inscribed
on the stone tablets oi the pit as:

God is Love

Love is Blind

Blind is Ray Charles

Ray Charles is God!

Will Grirlnell lose its standing as
one of the 47 “livenble” communi-
ties in the U S. whenwhat has transr
pired becomes known'7 Unfol‘r
tunntely, what is done is done. Why
anyone would take the time and till”-
ellort (only the writings were painted
over leaving the walls obscenely
splattered with me white paint) to
ruin our study pit is beyond compre—
hension, It is now up to those of us
who still believe in true intellectuals
ism, individuality, and tree speech
to try to rectiiy the situation as
best we can. t

Seeks Concern
For Homosexuals

To The Editors:

To a segment of the student body,
there is something proloundly lackr
ing in their “Grinneil experience",
I am specifically relerring to the
homosexuals on the campus For us
there exists a void or a social
vacuum in a very important part ot
our social environment.

Aside [rpm the usual hassles assor
ciated with college lile (such as the
infamous academic pressure), the
homosexual at Grinnell is presently
denied social interaction with large
groups or our peers. Campus lite for
us can be truly lonely at times, with
only a few randomly discovered gay
friends to discuss our inner selves,
We have unique lile styles, and hence
olten unique problems, whichprer
sently the college community is not
geared to handle. There simply does
not exist means of communication
and organizations lrom which gay
Grinnellians can achieve our full
identity We must function partially
in a social vacuum, keeping an inr
tegral part of ourselves hidden from
View.

1 am not saying that we should all
“come out", that could be disastrous
on a reactionary campus like ours.
But l do think it is essential that all
the isolated cliques become known to
each other. We can only stand to
benefit from meeting with a large
group of our peers, ranging from
discussions ofour problems oncam-
pus to collective action to alleviate
them,

I imagine this letter will precipi-
tate many iokes, but it is very ser-
ious in intent. 1 also imagine a good
many straights will read this and
say: “Shit, they got a hell or nerve
to bitch. Our ‘social environment'
ain't so not either.” We realize
that because for all appearances
we’ve tried to live the straight life
too. But now it is time we have the
means to try to improve our social
environment, The fact that we feel
we need additional facllities to im»
prove the quality of our campus life
doesn't mean we don’t like you
straight people. Some of my best
lriends are straight, they really are;
honest. You just have some things
we don’t want or need,

To all the gay people who read
this, i realize ttiis isn’t the most
articulate presentation ofour cause,
it wasn’t intended [or that purpose.
My purpose was to open a dialog on
our campus situation. I hope this is
the start oi many letters to the 5‘63
and ideally these letters will cli-
max in the information of a viable
campus organization. We can only
improve our campus situation, and
our situation in the United States in
general, through collective action.
l'd also like to apologize lor not
signing my name, but i inst don't
trust the reaction of our straight
fellow Grinnelllans,

To you straight people, it I was too
hard on you, tough shit Seriously
though, it i misiudged your reaction
I'll like to apologize But I‘ve been
ally on the wall too many times. You
see us “Iaggots” look just like you
and we act the same way too And
unless we til you, you’ll never know
we were “queer”, Hence I’ve
listened to all your complimentary
remarks. But time changes all
things, perhaps even people can
change

To The Editors‘

The tollowing is an open letter to
you and to the college community:

i assume that any responsible
newspaper, or [or that matter any
interested or responsible person,
would want to get at What is behind
this current “Black Rage” in which
we are all involved. Ido not want
to appear as an apologist lor black
action, but certainly it would be
accurate to say that the Grinnell
Scarlet and Black has been almost
libelous in its dilemma in trying to
accurately report on current der
velopments on this campus.

i realize that accuracy is an eXr
tremely complicated problem par
ticularly for the Grinnell Scarlet
and Black, but not solely {or The
Scarlet and Black. The problem has
several parts. The press must be
able to accurately report the facts
or dynamic stories in a manner that
the individuals most directly or ins
directly involved will be understood
and judged lairly. it must also inter—
pret the news so that it canbeunder-
stood. This is tremendously diffir
cult.

Although the press was on the
scene, at Burling Library on ThurSr
day evening, it lailed to give an ade-
quate and correct reporting of
events. Since I am so deeply in,
volved in your myopic reporting
which has created a credibility gap.
let me make a further comment,
My involvement in Hurling has been
overstated and distorted, and there
can be no argument over the legiv

tiinacy or my being in Hurling,

Let me make it clear to The Scar—
let and Black and its readers, the
burden of proof rests on The Scar-
let and Black and all those seers
who are trying to read and inter
pret my actions.

The resolution at our dilemma will
not be easily nor quickly achieved
even it you were to write a corrected
report of those events which you so
brilliantly reported in a slanted,
distorted, and fabricated manner.
But more than any other issue, i
remind you once again, the main
responsibility {or accuracy within
the trame or our legal system rests
upon you.

Let us be frank and admit that you
did not know my role in Hurling. Let
it be further stated that sucharend-
ing of my role by you and others has
already triggered a campaign or
insults. it is worth noting that all
attempts to mufﬂe me through in~
suits and pressure will not succeed
for I will not become a eunuch-A
neither as a scholar nor as a black
man in Twentieth Century America.

Two or the three articles in inst
week’s 3&5 which contained rater-
ences to Mr. Thornton were checked
with Mr. Thornton and npproved
prior to publication. We were up-
parentiy in error in including him
in the ﬁrst paragraph, as one at

in the Twentieth Century Room. We
stand by everything else in the lead

Carolyn Wallace Noi Opposed

To The Editor

Two articles in last Friday’s 5553
are grossly inaccurate and dan»
gerous to a college community reel,
lng under a barrage of rumor and
vicious gossip,

The 5&3 of 13 February states that
women laculty opposed the appoint-
ment of Caroline—Reid Wallace, It
also states that there was a meeting
of the Executive Council and the
“Women’s Search Committee" on
Thursday. The women laculty were
not contacted by the SALE; the women
laculty have no power in laculty
hiring except as members or their
own departments. They did not all
meet Mrs. Wallace, but all women
who did meet here were very {avore
ably impressed by her, There is no
separate women’s search com-

lalonde Expands

To The Editors:

i would like to review one para-
graph in your account ol the open
meeting or the Library Committee

held February 17. You Write: ‘All
members ol the library committee
gave lavorable reactions to the con
cept or a Black Library, but Gerald
Lalonde. Classical Languages, said
it would be “dangerous to give
carte blanche a tramework that has
the rubber stamp oi the library com-

mittee " .

Regarding the grammar and style
or the “quotation", i hope, but with
a hesitation more pedagogic than
moral, that the suggestion olilliter-
acy was unwitting on the part ol the
son, As lor the word "dangerous”,
I disclaim it simply because I did
not use it, although it does have a
ring ol hysteria, which also is not
my style

More bothersome aspects oi the
paragraph are its abrupt and amr
biguous transition (”..,but..”), and
its withering density, which distort
my position on the Black Library and
the views which 1 stated last Thursr
day.

At the outset ol the meeting, the
spokesman tor Concerned Black stu-
dents expressed the nope that the
Library Committee would go on rev
ord by the time it adjourned as
“agreeing on the concept” bl the
Black Library as embodied in the
written proposal or CBS,'At the
same time, the Committee wasasked
not to concern itsell with quantitar
tive aspects ol the Black Library,
although the proposal itsell cone
tained many fairly concrete sug
gestions. I expressed my dirticulty

mittee. The fullstime women faculty
are organized solely for the purpose
of seeking improvement in their own
living and working conditions.

The paper’s staff must be thorough
in its research on sensitive issues.

library Statement

in dealing with the “concept” with»
out consideration of its form, unless
we were to consider the mere exis~
tence of a Black Library. But that
was an issue settled last semester.

More to the point, 1 observed that
the Library Committee is not Como
missioned to ”agree" to “con-
cepts"; its duty is to make recom-
mendations to the Administration on
substantive matters of library poli—
cy, atter detailed study and discus-
sion or all necessary questions, in-
cluding finances. But it was in keep-
ing with this function that the Com—
mittee expressed its intention and
interest in making more than a
cursory study at the proposal sub-
mitted by CBS, and, in consultation
with them, the library staff, and the
financial officers of the College,
formulating for the Administration a
recommendation for the precise
constitution of the Black Library.
If the Library Committee's interest
in thoroughness is construed as
negative and dilatory, it is unfbr»
tunate and ironic, since precisely
such attention to hard fact in the.
original negotiation of the Black
Library might well have obviated our
current mutual complaint, “This
is not what we had in mind.”

G. V. Lalonde

The correct phraseology should be

‘Lalnnde said it would be unwise
"to give a carte blanche which has
the rubber stamp ol the Library
Committee" ', instead of ‘it would
be “dangerous to give carte blanche
a framework that has the rubber
stamp of the library Committeel” ’
We apologize,tor the e'rror. --The
