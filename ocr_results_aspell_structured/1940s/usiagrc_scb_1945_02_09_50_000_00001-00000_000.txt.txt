Two Threads
In Play Plot

Andrews Revises Plot;
Moor Born Scheduled
For March 23 and 24

Moor nor-ii, which will be pro—
duced by the drama department
on March 23 and 24, is one of
several plays based on the lives
of members of a strange and tal-
ented family, the Brontes.

The version which the Collegel
cast will present was written by
Dan Totheroh and has been ex-
tensively revised by Kent An—
drews. assistant professor of dra-
matic art.

The play is laid in the barren.
Bronte parsonage in Haworth.
Yorkshire, England. The plot
centers around two themes: one
the literary successes of thel
girls, Charlotte (Virginia Foote),
Emily (Marguerite Watsom. and
Ann (Barbara Macoubrey); and
the other, the moral and physical
disintegration of their . brother,
Branwell (Stuart Roederi.

Branwell possesses none of the
native genius of the two girls;
he becomes a drunkard and dope
hand. The sisters make iron-
ical sacri 'ces in the attempt to
save their brother. but in vain

highly dramatic scenes. the
shows three years in the
lives of the family, beginning
with the discovery of the girls'
books of poems which they pub-
lish in the hope of saving their
brother. (It ends with the tragic
death at Emily, who attempts to
make a sacrifice for Branwell in
the form of a poem giving him
the authorship of Wuthei-ing
Heights — a poem which is dc~
strayed by Charlotte immediate—
ly upon Emily's death.)
