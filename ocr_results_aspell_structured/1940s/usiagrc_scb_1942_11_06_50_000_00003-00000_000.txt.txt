Al Nichols, Bl‘llnle Vansti-um.
Tex Kaufmann and Walt Bums.
Burns, who entered school as a
freshman the second semester last
year, will not be eligible for var-
sity ball until the end of first

‘ semester, but will work out with

the varsity squad, Douglas said.

"On the basis of returning let-
termen and material available, it
doesn’t look as good as it has at
the beginning of the last two
years, but other schools in the
conference may be similarly hand-
icapped," he said.

.A representative from Grinnell
will attend a meeting of the Mid-
west Conference schools in Chi-
cago, November 21, to discuss
possible changes in schedules be-
cause of the transportation situ-

’dtion ,and revisions in Conference

man basketball squad has gone
out, actual practice for the trash
will not begin for at least a
week, Douglas said.
