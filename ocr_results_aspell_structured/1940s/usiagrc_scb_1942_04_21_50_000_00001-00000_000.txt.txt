uDrop Dibble" Plan Dropped

Stevens, House Presidents Agree

 

Two and one-half hours after
going into conference regard-
ing the abolition of Dibble
hall and the installation of
freshman houses, Pres. Same
uel N. Stevens and the Coun-
cil of House P re side ll ts
emerged from the little din-
ing-room at the men’s dermis
tol‘ies last night, each side
nearing the Smile of victory.

The accomplishments of the
meeting consisted of:

(1) Assurance by Presi-
dent Stevens that Dibble
would not be a freshman
hall.

(2) Making- both Langan
and CowleS hall freshman
houses next year.

(3) A plan whereby all
freshman men who, not be-
iugr accomodated in the two
freshman houses because of

lack of space, would be
equally apportioned thrur

out the rest of the halls.

(4) Conlpeti ion whereby
if yearlings living in upper—
class halls make a better

record than the preps iii»
ing in freshman halls, then

both Cowlcs and Lang-an

would be organized as the
rest of the dormitories are
organized.

Otherwise, complete adop-
tion of the freshman hall
system would be made.

The mceting was attended by
Stevens, the House Presidents,
G. Gordon Ellis, men’s counselor,
and William Kaloupck, president
of the student Council.

The president, upon presenta-
tion of petitions signifying that
almost 100% of the student body
were against the original plan,
stated that, "this is the best sign

of student Cohcsmn I have ever
seen on the cainpu '

The dinner meeting began with
both Stevens and the House Presi—
dents intent on having their own
way When it was over, both
sides still hail what thcy were
after, and neither had lost face.

Answering the question of Rob-
ert ci-andall, C. of H. P. presi-
dent, as to what exactly he want
ed to accomplish, Stevens said in
part:

"We organize so that no liiiic
our freshman in freshman hous-
cs with the conditions necessary
for their proper orientation In
college life. other men, eurept
those liiiiig in rrcthninn halls,
would live under the regular
hall system, except that their
would be no freshman.

“With a man living in a
freshman hall, he would gain
a sufficient perspective of
the college as a whole, and

then he could devote his last
three years to hall loyalty.

“There would be a ratio of one
uppciclassnian to SIX freshman
with a very strong grade of up-
pcrclassman being used.”

The president cited three rear
sons for making the change:

(1) It would conserve a larg-
cr number of preps who might
drop li-oni collcgc because of
academic failure or otherwise.

(2) Give the freshman an
llll»college point of view instead
of the other.

(3) When mcn graduated
from the college, the primary
attachment would be to Grin-
iicll, rather than on individual
hell.

“You will return as a mem-
ber of the class of ‘42 or ’43,
not as a Dibble alumnus," he
said.

“Class spirit is dead at
Grinnel,” Stevens claimed.

“and the alumni since 1924
are indifferent to the col-
lege.”

"Conserve the house system,
yet install class spiiit is what I
propose to do," he stated. “After
the freshman year, hall contact

can be built in three year's time.”
The point was raised by Cran-

dall that Steveiis' plan would
make the dormitories like the
quadrangle.

Answering the query, Steve
ens asserted that, if the men
adopted the policy of living
three years in a hall, the wo-
men would probably adopt it
too, thus building up more cot-
toga and class spirit over the
west sidc of the tracks.
Crandall, trying to prove that

the houses could handle freshman
academic problems cited the case
