gills of this idle custom?

The chapel committee had this question in;
mind when they planned the Lenten services
which are being held every Wednesday‘
morning during the Lenten season. What is
the meaning of Lent, and what it its signi-
ficance to us? Is is too rarely that we think
of religion as a vital question; we accept
it 01' we disregard it, scarcely heeding the
fact that it is one of the oldest and most
enduring, and one of the most mysterious of
all human institutions It is strange indeed
that in an institution of learning the prevail-
ing attitude toward so many issues of im-
portance should be this lethargic disregard.

We suggest that this year your obse ' lance
of the Lenten season he more than giving up
cokes between Ash Wednesday and Easter.
Why not try attending the Wednesday chapel
services?

THE LENTEN SERVICES

In all our religious festivals, it is often the
pagan element fused with the Christian
whicll has come to dominate our observance.
For most of us Christmas is little more than
a winter festival whose traditions have
come from the Dutch and the Scandinavians
rather that from J udea; and likewise Easter
is pagan ill almost evely detail. Yet cur-
iously enough, the little marathon we make
of our observance of Lent has its origin in
the orthodox church and traces far back into
the history of the Jews. It is the fashion
to observe Lent, even though we may have
only the faintest notion of what it is all
about, so we give up coke—drinking, smoking,
swearing—some luxurious little vice which
we have every intention of resuming the
day after Easter.

There is nothing to he said against this
faintly sacrilegious little game except that
for those of us who are uninitiated it is a
little ridiculous to do a thing when we have
no idea of why we are doing it. But might
it not be well to consider seriously the ori-

classes.

“What did he say?"

“Boy we really got something from him!"

Why this contrast? Because Davis per-
mitted himself to be guided by questions
from interested students so that he told them
what they really wanted to know. He was
not limited by the bounds of a formal lec-
ture colisistillg of axiomatic statements, quo-
tations from previously written books, and
quips intended to ”slay” the audience.

One can't gain an understanding of the
ideas and personality of famous men by lis-
tening to a short formal lecture. in the
first place there isn’t enough time to pelle-
trate a stranger. In the second place. if the
man had any well»organizcd, original ideas
he wouldn’t waste them on an Iowa college
audience, bllt would write them up ill a
book so that he could make some money on
them.

Since time is necessary for the informal
conversations and class meetings so valuable
in understanding the personality of famous
people, it might be advisable to have fewer
lecturers and have them stay on the campus
longer. One suggestion would be to have the
professors in the various departments choose
outstanding men in their fields and have
these men come to the campus for a few
days. These men would meet the classes
in their field and anyone else who cares to
come alld listen,

weird lights, and caustic com-

drama department’s presentation
of Ibsen's “Ghosts" progressed to
a late hour last night. To a re—
porter in search of a. drama story,
braving the wrath of Mrs. Pryor,
it was an awe inspiring sight,

On stage, Mrs. Alvlng (Margar-
et Currier) and son Oswald (Al-
fred Boylen) were cmoting to the
accompaniment uf fierce censor»
ship and derogatory remarks of
various “officials," while the
lighting crew (located somewhere
in parts unknown) was enduring
a terrific blast of sarcasm bar
cause the ”fire" Wasn't flickering
just right and someone’s face
wasn't “lit up enough.” Typical
dress rchearsell.

The technical aspects
production are, to this reporter,
effectively executed, especially
the lighting and set decoration,
The set was built in the newlye
constructed drama workshop and
features some valuable period
furniture and other props which
were loaned to the department.

The action of the drama begins
in late afternoon and ends at
dawn the following day, giving an

nicknacks and Norwegian brass-

Britt's/l Refusal
To Aid Finland
Called U. S. Cue

—By William 0. Harris.

Editor’s Note: This column was
written before unconfirmed rue
nlOrS were published or morn-
ing that (iron: Bl n uud
France would aiil Finland d-
gnillst Russia.

Latest reports irom the nation’s
capital indicate that Congressional
mail bags are now bulging with
hot demands for unrestrictea
monetary aid to the struggling
Finns.

Representing an unprecedent-
ed swing in opinion, thcsc com-
municnlions are undoubtedly
spircd by the heroic smnd of
under-dog Finland against Rus—
sia's millions. At the outbreak
of the northern conflict, Ameri-
can sentiment was staunchly op-
posed to dabbling in Europe's
quarrels.

But now the hitherto smoulder-
lug question of America's attitude
toward the Russo-Finnish wor
threatens to burst into an emo-
tional flame of interventionism.

In cw of this expression of
opinion, the recent refusal of
aid to Finland by Norway and
Sweden must have come as an
unwelcome blow to democratic,
front hopes in the United states.
Hence, it may be interesting to
note the unlopubllcized story
behind this seemingly heartless
Seand‘nnrinn doublercross.

Early in February, Premier De-
ladier 'of France indicated to
Prime Minister Chamberlain of
Great Britain that the French
strongly advocated major aid to
Finland in the form of trained
troops and adequate quantities or
munitions.

Later, Noruny and Sucdcn
iiiloi-mcd Great Britain of their
entire willingness to give im-
mediate dill in men and mater-
ials to thc Instewenkening Finns
until allied :tld could become cf-
fcctivc.

But, as usual, Britain dallied.
And it was not until two weeks
after the date of the French pro-
posal that the slow-moving Tory
cabinet acted. '

And then it pussy-fooled, soli—
omging all direct aid to the
little Baltic country nnd refus-
ing to guarantee the safety of
Norway and Sweden. Hencc,
these mo countries, left on
tlicir own and fowl by strong
German threats, -crc forced to
refuse Finland's frantic plans
for aid.

Alth ugh a program of mater-
Sh aicl to Finland would
have offered much-needed proof
of England’s oftrdeclared theory
that she is fighting for democracy
and the freedom of small count—
ries, she should not be condemned
too severely for this betrayal of
the Firms.

After all, British aid to Fill-
land would have meant unr
with Russia, an extension of
tlic conflict to the Near East,
rind a renewal of that ancient
British bug-bear, the Russian
tlircut to British indict. And
the empire is worth more to
Euglnud than Finnish democ-
racy.

Another example 0[ British rock
ismia realism which our letter-
wi-itcrs might do well to corn
sider in determining an attitude
of AlnEl'iczln aid to Finland. If
Britain, thousands of miles closer
to thc conflict, can see no gain
in unlimited aid to Finland, would
not much less gain accrue to the
United States from giving such
