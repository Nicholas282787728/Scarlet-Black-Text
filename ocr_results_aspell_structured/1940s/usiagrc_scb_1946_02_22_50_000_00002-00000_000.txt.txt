In Praise of Candor - -

We'd like to offer our thanks and con-
gratulations to the board of religion for the
oiltstanding chapel programs of the past
three Weeks. The large attendance at these
meetings seems to indicate a desire on the
p ‘t of the students to hear the beliefs of
different religious groups presented with
candor and conviction.

Perhaps this 'is an indication of a step
down from the ivory tower in which we are
all too prone to isolate ourselves With ob-
jective eye we examine philosophies, holding
ourselves above and beyond wholehearted
acceptance of a point of View. We study the
historicity of the Bible, and take pride in

true belief. Intellectual isolationism, barren
of any living belief upon which to base one’s
actions, is the result. '

lodged to be non-scientific, we disregard the}
now established findings of a near-science,
psychology, which tells us that few hu il
actions are based'upon rational and d1 -
passionate thinking. We know we act on
emotion, belief, prejudice So do all our
associates. Yet we strive throughout college
to ignore the intangible factors in human
makeaip which make our world as it is.

again, And please give us l] chalice to hear

Farewell To Arms - -

Once again, because there are again men!
on the campus, we hear ”greetings from
the president,” as those who have not yet
served in the armed forces get their call.
Within the next few weeks, several students
will be inducted. We will Sing here’s to,
brother so—and-so, just as we did during

dent men left.

So the selective service hoards continue
to call college men into the armed forces.
It has been said that Within the next few
decades, we will experience in the United
States and all over the world, a dearth of a
basic natural resource—well educated men
for the professions and businesses Today,
however, we find that this dire prediction is
off-set completely by the huge enrollments
under the G. I. bill. Colleges and univer-
sities are screaming for space, for instruc—
tors, for equipment, as their dromitol-ies
bulge. The ”crop" of educated men will be
late, but it will be a bumper crop.

We hate to see ollr class-mates leaving.
again for induction centers. But they leave,
with the knowledge that after they have
done their job, they can return to college
free from financial worries.
