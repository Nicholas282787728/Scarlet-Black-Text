Inlet-School Alhlelics

“Grimlell college will carry on is
athletic program as long as it
can," G. Lester Duke, athletic
director, said yesterday, in dis»
cussing the future of competitive
sports at Grinnell.

Duke pointed out that the
drafting of 18 and 19 year old
men into the service will put col-
Iegiate competition upon the
shoulders of men in the enlisted
reserves.

“If our inter-collegiate system
does break down by next year,
we will have to rely on an ene
larged intro-mural program to
carry the load," he said.

According to Du Grinneii is
not going to throw i the sponge

Thirteen freshman men have re-

basketball squad, G. Lester Duke
said today.

“The talent that has been
demonstrated so far is only over-
age, Duke remarked. "but. there

six men are being developed
as forwards, and six more as
guards, but only one ccntcr has
been found as yet. In contrast to
the low average height of the
team as a whole, is center .Al
Carlson, six foot two inch trans-
fer from Marshalltown Junior
College, who played against the
prep Pioneers last winter.

Foiwards are Richard Ryden,
James Gibbs, Bob Miller, Nash
Dowdle, Bill Kiyasu, and Walter
Schliiter; and the prospective
guards are Bill Ecklnnd, Thomas
Russell, Bob Kuenzell, Joe Jack-
son, Fred Collins, and Bill Lun-
dahl.

It is still too early for Duke to
attempt to pick a team, but till
now Ryden and Gibbs, forwards,
Carlson, center, and Eoklund,
guard, have shown up well. Gibbs,
though small, is fast and well-
coordinated.

reported that Pioneer officials
are planning a football schedule
for 1943.

“However,” he stated, "from
now on wc will have to schedule
games near home, and we will
not be able to carry on as am-
bitious a program as we have
in the past,
