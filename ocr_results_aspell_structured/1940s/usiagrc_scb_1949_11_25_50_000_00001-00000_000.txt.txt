“We had better go back to our

sources of power which enr
able men to be dynamic," Dr.
Samuel N. Stevens at the
Thanksgiving chapel services.

“Everywhere one finds the ef—
fects of a gnawing fear, a lack
of faith. and a quest for ma-
terial security,” he continued.
“Only faith offers security."

Naming fear our main prob-
lem, Dr, Stevens contrasted us
to our ancestors. “Those
courageous men dared to allow
difference and nonrconformity."
He stated that although we live
in a time of fear, we must re.
member that “the essence of
life is growth."

He concluded with the hope‘
that we will rediscover ouri

/,

 

heritage “in the name of God
and all it implies; fatherhood,
brotherhood, and victory."

Grinnell Will
Send Three To
Negro School

By Joan Wohl

Sophomores Jan Reinke, Bob
Holloway, and Nick Piediscalzi
have had their applications for
second semester study at Hamp—
ton Institute, Hampton, Va., ac-
cepted by a board made up of
Dr: John Burma. Dean Winston
King, Dean Evelyn Gardner and
Dean Lester Duke.

Each year exchange Students
from Hampton, an aleregro col.
to Grinnell for a
se‘ﬂ'ester While Grinnell Students
,ot to the southern school.

“1 wanted a chance to iind
out first hand about the
Negroes," said Jan in an inter.
view this week when she was
asked why she had applied.

“My parents gave their per.
mission and are very enthusiasa
tic avbut it,” she added.

Sociology Major

Jan, who has decided to ma~
jor in sociology, plans to go in-
to the field of technical journal-
ism, writing on sociological
topics. At Hampton she expects
to study cultural anthropology,
Negro literature, zoology and the
psychology of religion, among
othcr things. _

A member of NAACP. Jan
says she was extremely inter-
ested in the exchange program
when she first heard of it last
year / She has discussed the
so do with Kathy Buehrer,

ose hall junior, who went

ere last year. ,

“Although I had spoken to my
parents about it, 1 never dream-
ed I'd have a chance to go,"
Jan exclaimed.

To Enter Ministry

Both Nick and Bob expect to
enter the ministry. Nick plans on
being a philosophy major while
Bob is thinking of concentrat-
ing in the field of psychology
at Grinnell.

Nick’s reasons for wishing to
go to Hampton include an in-
terest in the race problem and
the desire to know what it feels
like to live in a minority group.

“1 can put the experience 1
gain there to good use later,
here and elsewhere," he ex-
plained.

His interest in racial study
has been fostered by work in
the Pilgrim Fellowship and his
membership in NAACP.

Being accepted for Hampton
is an “awfully good opportuni-
ty to acquire an understanding
of colored people." Bob believes.

An awareness of the racial
problem in the United States and
an extreme interest in the sub-
ject were included in his rea—
sons for applying for Hampton.

“My plan to enter the ministry
also partly helps to explain my
interest, he added.

 

The second semester at Hamp-
ton will begin Feb. 6.
