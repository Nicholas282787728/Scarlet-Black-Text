From lhe
BLEACHERS

By Bob Powell

Come next Saturday this writ-
er is going to see something he's
been awaiting for a long timei
the sight of Crinnell playing a
football game. Only the seniors
can remember when Crinnell
fought on the gridiron for her
place on the football record. The
faculty, I have observed, are one
hundred per cent behind the boys
too, and Saturday will see a
hleacher full of loyal fans.

Not much is known of the
Carthage teamrwhat type of
play is employed. the strength
of the line, etc. However, Car-
thage‘s team Will be given a fair
and hard fight by one game
bunch of guys.
on that. for Coach Reed's boys
are out to win this game.

Especially deserving of praise
are the boys in the front wall
for the hard work-out they con~
tinually take each night. Ina
jurles every now and then take
out a man from practice. Mac-
beath. center, has been having a
little trouble with his right knee.
Leonard, end. damaged his knee
also, and the way it looks at the
present moment he won't be able
to play in the game Saturday.
Dewitt’s sprained ankle will
probably not allow him to play
either. Let's hope we don’t
have any more tough luck.

The back field is doing good
fast work and ought to keep
Carthage guessing a good share
of the time. It is a “revolvmg”
backfield in which the fellows
are capable of swrtclnng around
to different positions. Wcli, see
you all out at Ward Field at
two oblock Saturday afternoon.

Now a few words about basket-
ball and what we can expect in
that sport. John Trucsdalo. die
rector of physical education, has
indicated that games wrth all
Midwest Conference teams are
available except with Monmouth.
There is some question as to
whether football should be con-
tinued until November 17, or
whether basketball should be bee
gun earlier and thus more prac-
tice to he had. More about the
basketball picture next week.

Food and pictures were the
keynote of the plans outlined by
the freshman commission at their
meeting in the Main drawing

Guided by Marcia Reed, RhWr

concessions at the Saturday foot-

which are posted there have
grown out of date, the commis-
sion decided.

The following have been chosen
for the commission because of
their records in activity partici—
pation and on tho recommendar
tion of their house chairmen:
Mary Ann Abel, Mears; Jean
Alliband,‘RaWson: Nancy Boman,

vides a means for the freshman

YWCA.
