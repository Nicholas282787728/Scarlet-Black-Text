The Grow+h (Elie Gripe - -

The U. S. Army runs on the theory that
there is nothing wrong with a good healthy
gripe. It clears the air . . . brings the thing
out illto the light of day. This theory ap-
plies pretty well in all phases of life, in
cluding that of the college campus. It‘s
‘only natural and human to kick about the
food and the class hours and the assign-
ments. By so doing, we let off steam and
forget the mattelx However, in recent weeks
the griping on this campus has taken on
a different complexion, and has grown out
of all proportions. It has become almost
defeatist in its tone. It is not aimed at
any particular or correctible object, but con-
cerns itself with life in general.

This attitude, while not excusable, is
explainable. Every student is asking himr
self what lies ahead, and in most cases he
is finding either a very unsatisfactory an—
swer or no answer at all.

We have learned ill the past few months
that we cannot foresee the end of the warl
The uncertainty of the future leaves the
student with serious problems concerning
his education, and since securing an edu-
cation is his reason for being here, this
doubt is reflected in all that he does If
the war is going to last several years
longer, we will face an entirely different
kind of life after we leave school than we

will if victory comes within the next year.
We wonder if we would be smart to quit
school now, work while we can earn easy
money with little skill, and then return to
school after the war.
mitted to finishing college, we sometimes
question the choice of a liberal arts college
in what seems to be an era of increasing
specialization and technology. Some of us
just want to “go someplace where we can
have a little fun.” With these thoughts in
mind, we are confused and unhappy, and
do not hesitate to show it. We are spar
thetic toward our studies which at times
seem so futile. A few students have given
up.

Admitting that such a state of mind
is bad for the students and for the college,
we must in all fairness seek a change. The
solution lies not in a change of curriculum
or social program, but in the mental outlook
of each individual.

No generation of college students has
ever known what kind of life it would face
after college. Those graduating at the time
of the last war were doubtless assailed by
the same doubts and fears that face us.
The student of the opulent twenties may
have planned very optimistically, but he
was the person who had to establish himself
and raise his family during the depression
of the thirties. The graduate of the depres-
sion period Saw college men and women in
the bread line.

Our outlook for the future, though una
certain, need not be gloomy. We have a
good chance of avoiding the mistakes that
were made by our parents, a chance that
is heightened by thorough understanding
of economics and history and philosophy
No civilization can function on technical
skills alone Thinkers, who nevertheless can
seen the practical problems, must direct and
coordinate the work of the specialists. Grill—
nell is trying to train us for this place

Today, as our country is finally ”going
to war” in all senses of the expression, peo-
ple aren’t having much “fun” anywhere
There is a job to do, We can contribute
to the war effort by doing what we are
best equipped to doistudying to prevent
a reoccurrence of the national tragedy, We
will have our place in'the post war world
if we banish defeatism and get back to
work.

My piece of luggage, loaded wlth

‘with a boneacrushmg thud oi:

gentleman that had taken over
my seat at Iowa City, and catch-

down due aisle which was echoing
the conductors cry of “Grinncll.”
(I was standing ’next to the coir
ductor while he was screaming
out the name of the dcurly be-
loved town that houses our il-
lustn‘ous alma mater, and I heard
him whisper silently “thank God."
You’d almost think we were un-

Since it quite apparently is a
Grinncll tradition that whenever
you arrive in Grlrmell you are
’greeted with invigorating precip-
litation, I oozed down the steps
leading from the tram,
between the sidewalls and my
luggage (that damn luggage),

Everybody that was anybody

frozen countenances. So I was
left alone. I have a roommate,
