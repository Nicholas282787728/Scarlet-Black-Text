GRINNELL, IOWA, JANUARY l9,

Miss Boyd, on Leave,
Describes Red Cross

In Overseas Service

By Stuart Reader

Robin and Susie didn't bark last
January 6, when they heard foot»
steps on the front porch of Dr.
Wood's house. The footsteps did
not belong to Dr. or Mrs. Wood,
but they did belong to some one
the two dogs knew.

So when the trim uniformed
Red Cross overseas worker enter-
ed the front door. pandemonium
virtually tore loose. Both play-
ful Robin and shy Susie recog-
nized Miss Evelyn Boyd, former
assistant professor of English at
Gnnnell, who owns them and is
lend-leasing them to the Woods
while she is in the service.

In American Theater

Miss Boyd is wearing the cam-
paign ribbon for the American
theatre of war and three stripes
for her twenty»one months over»
seas service. Unable for military
reasons to be too specific with
her statements as to type of work
and her location, she was able
to give forth with some interest»
ing information on Red Cross
serVices.

Every branch has
qualifications, although

its own
in gen»

eral the age limit is twenty three.
The four general areas of over—
seas work are club service, Club
mobile work, assistant field di-
rectors, and hospital recreation
work.

Club Service

Club service calls for girls who
are good mixers, good dancers,
and the work is similar to that
of a U. S. o. hostess. Clubmo-
bile units require girls who can
drive cars, so that they can take
trucks out as close to the front
lines as possible. These trucks
carry supplies of doughnuts and
coffee and a small library and
table games.

To work in hospital recrea-
tion a girl should have some
sort of handicraft experience.
since the work is with service»
men who are bed-ridden and
have lost eyes, fingers, and have
been otherwise injured.

Good Nature Essential

“Above all else, yes, above
even glamor and personality, a
girl must have a good nature to

[take the unpleasant and not let

it get her down. She can‘t 5qu

or he moody."

1945

At her particular station Miss
Boyd was the only worker, and
she was everything from a chap-
lain to a club worker. “The
Red Cross overseas is‘the one
means of contact between the
boys and the family back home,"
stressed Miss Boyd. She has,
during her work overseas, hand-
led requests for everything from
rerouting a school bus to pick
up a serviceman‘s little daughter
to requests for emergency leavcs
because of the death of a broth-
er iii another theater of war.

The training usually calls for
a month's indoctrination at the
area school. Then the worker' is
given several months‘ sauce in
home stations and is finally as-
signed aiid sent overseas in a
unit.

The term of overseas service
is 13 months, and then after a
leave, the worker is reassigned
to another overseas post. A girl
can enlist for either domestic or
overseas service, the term of
enlistment being for the duration
and six months.

Miss Boyd will report to Wash~
ington a week from Monday for
reassignment.

 

ln Appeal Over
Proper’ry. College
Loses Tax Sull-

College Financial Loss
Will Not Affec’r
Present Running Sl’al‘e

Although the college recently lost
an appeal to the Iowa Supreme
Court and will be forced to pay
taxes on a piece of Des Moines
property, the financial loss will
mean no difference in running ex»
penses, Dean Ea'rl D. strong an-
nounced Wednesday.

Polk county required the col»
lege to pay taxes on the prop-
erty, given to Grmnell by the
Younker foundation, in spite of
a state law which exempts col-
leges from paying taxes on real
estate owned by them. The col»
lege refused to pay the taxes
and sued the county but lost both
the suit and the supreme court
appeal. In a contested verdict
the court decided that since Grin-
ncll must pay an annuity to the
Younker family, the property has
not become a part of the endow-
ment funds of the college.

“Loss of this suit won’t mean
that Crinnell will have fewer
professors, lcss equipment, or any—
Mr. Strong.
emphasized, “It will affect the
amount of money set aside for
the erection of the Health Cen»
ter.“
