Experience of the \yeekia visit
to a Brief Music rehearsal. With
plume in hand your reporter
dropped in last night to con the
progress of the'play, and almost
got homesick for the dorm. The
set looks like our room just be»
fore Mother came for the week»
end . . . Miss Loeffler says she
couldn’t make it realistically clutr
tered because there wouldn't be
room for the action. To get at-
mosphere, though, she dropped
in at the quad one night, so if
you recognize anything, it's prob-
ably a replica, in the exact man-
ner of the Grinnell college thea-
ter.

We solicited statements from
the cast, too, just to let you
know what they think of their
production. Bobby Ward thinks
that you'll like it. .

steps out of character to be-
come a very radical reformer set
to remake the World. Natalie
Kenyon, the coed in the play who
lands her man. requests that we
publish an alphabetical list of the
dates that the cast has given
up for the numerous rehearsals. .
to this ironic request, we only
say that our alphabet's out of
order for the duration. we shud-
dered at the remark thatwhen we
take our fifth-row-center seat on
Saturday, April 21 (you can avoid
us by going Friday night. if yol‘l’d
rather) we will all see ourselves.

charmer. Comments Miss Loefﬂer
above the din, “They’re sure hav-
ing a good time doing it. The
only difference between this show
and the show at the dorm is
that they don't get into their
pajamas at Seven.”

We enjoyed the rehearsal, and
the back stage tales of the waste-
basket that caught on fire when
someone tossed a cigarette into
it while dashing out to see a
fire that supposedly was taking
place on the imaginary campus

Six Weeks - - .

60,480 Minu’res

Now that spring vacation has
gone flying rapidly past (so rap-
idly in fact that I can’t even
remember it) everyone's‘thoughts
are turning to summer. All of
which combined with my utter
exasperation with struggling with
Woodsy Mnium. Mniuiu cusplda»
turn and the beautiful day that
it is outside caused me to pon-
der just how long it was before I
board the Rocket and hurtlc

home.
It’s a fact that there are on—
ly 42 days between now and

May 24 when all of us shall have
completed our semester examina-
tions, That's an exact six weeks.
But six of the days aren‘t school
days, they are Sundays. At any
rate there are 1008 hours more
of Crinnell life left for you if
you leave after dinner on May
24. In terms of minutes that's
60,480 still to he lived through.
But what might be more inter
eating is that there are six Sat—
urdays left, and only five of each
of the week days. This means:

your eight o’clock classes will
meet only>21 more times (since
all classes end on Saturday the

eleven o'clocks will meet 21,
times more. But your split

only 20 times more.
