It’s been almost three
since about a third of our
said they were willing to
Grinneli’s first post—war foot-,
ball team. At that time therei
was great debate as to whether
any games could be scheduled and
that question was but recently
settled. Also. we couldn't help
wondering if twenty-five fellas
could sustain a football team.
That we shall continue to won-
der until the games have been
played.

Subject to faculty approval we
now have four games scheduled
which should offer quite a novel
thrill to a lot of us 7 that of
watching our own team on the
gridiron. .And a fighting team
it is. too. The teams we are
‘going to play will soon testify
ho that; but until then let me
say that Coach Reed couldn't ask
for a better bunch of fellas to
represent the Good School,

The spirit of the team is high
and its members show a fine
willingness to stay in there un-
til the final play of the day’s
practice. At this date the men
who are plugging hard for ye
old Grinnell are Sammy Benvc-
niste, Harvey Burnham, Gerald
Carpenter, Jim Carnahan, Jack
Chaffee, “Bing" Cobb, Dean De-
Witt, Bill Hoskins, Dave Leone
ard, Ernie Lieber, mo Lynn,
Dave MacBeath, Chuck Manly.

John Mitchell, Larry Moloney,,
Hilaire Moore, Bob Murdock,i
Wayne Naumann, Karl Pedersuni
Monty Reukberg, Alec. Wylie,
Bob Pederson, and Jack Peregoy.
They are being capably managed
by Wally Brennecke. These, then,

,are the boys who will decide
Grinneil’s fate on Word Field
November 10 should the faculty
approve the Wartburg game.

The boys are giving it every—
thing they've got, so let's all get
behind them. And if you have
a little extra time between in-
trannirals and classes and dinner,
try to watch a practice. Get an
idea of how these guys are all
trying to put Grinnell back on
the athletic map.

James Girls Work
To Complele Flag

Work is he=iig completed on
the servicemens flag to bring the
total number of gold stars to
forty and the number indicating
those from Grinnell in service to
1022. *

Mrs, Hazel
hoiiscmothei-, aided by Janet
Rydcn and Barbara Wright,
James sophomores, is working in
Main hall drawing room to finish
the flag so it can be hung in the
chapel for the Gates lecture series.

Browning, Mears

The sewing of stars was handlcd
by the men’s housemother orgi-
nally. For the past two years
the flag was kept up to date as
a war service activity. At pre-
sent the changes are small in
number so no specific organizw
tion has charge of the flag.

sor for Mortar Board, will be

the quadrangle dining room this

Ve+erans Plan ’

Refurnees May Enier
During College Year
Wifhou’r Losing Credits

Service men and women return-
ing to Grinnell may enter the
college at any time during the
college year. That is the unusual
part of the Grinnell system, Dean
Earl D. Strong, chaiman of the
veterans committee, pointed out
last week.

Grmllcll’s procedure for the
veteran is similiar to the one
used by schools throughout the
nation. However, the votel’dn’ls
committee has perfected these
arrangments to avoid the handir
caps of partial credits and in-
complete requiremeiim.

This plan applies to students
with college credits and to those
who enter as freshman. Under
this plan a veteran may enter at
any time and enroll for a number
of courses proportional to the
number of months remaining ir
the semester.

As an example: A veteran en-
tcring Grinnell bne month late
would enroll for three courses in-
stead of the usual four. receive
individual instructional held in his
accelerated plan of study, com;
plete the courses and take thé‘
final examinations with the i‘er‘
gular classes

By concentrating on a reduced
number of courses and continuous
tutorial help from the instructors,
the veteran will be able to finish
a full semester’s credit in the
courses he will be carrying.

Credit can be given for scho-

was in service. These credits will
be based on the amounts of in-
instruction given where the work
was done. credit for specialized
serVice courses will follow the ad-
vice of the American Council of
Education, '
