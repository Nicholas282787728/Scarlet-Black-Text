feels when he sees those fine
girls doing needed. appreciated
war work as nurses' aides, As
one girl said “This work is not
futlle. I feel as if I'm helping
in the war by doing something
constructive. while my friends
and the men of my family are
doing their hard serwce over
seas l'

I know that the hard working
hospital staff sincerely appreciate
the good work of the aides in the

Livities are being carried on,
