We Say To You ,_ -

You, the chosen delegates of the United
Nations have opened another conference.
Your aim—an organization, a world organ-
ization to insure a “lasting” peace. There
are some things we must say to you. You
are dubious? What can we, students in
Iowa, supposedly far removed from the ac-
tual deprivations and horrors of the \var
areas, add to your great knowledge, your
understanding of existing conditions and of
thewconditions that existed before this
\VBT.

But wait, it is not our intention to give
consul. Perhaps our knowledge of the war
is secondrhand~the inconveniences of ra-
tioning, the difficulty of procuring many
commodities. And again, perhaps it is not
as secondhand as you think; ours is a
father, brother, fiance, friend—gonkdoes
it make a difference? It is a part of the
difference. How do you suppose we feel

when others, older, conjecture about_the
“next” world war?

We want to tell you that it is our great-
est desire to face the issues. Do you sup,
pose that we are the few and dare to
speak about facing issues because here we,
seem relatively safe? No, it is because this,l
this chance for a futllre, is the more im-i
portant to us~us and others our age or,
younger all over the world. It is us you;
condemn to another era of chaos and hu—Z
man waste when you forget the future for
the past. We ask you not to quibble about
those things which will make a difference
ollly for now—for the next thirty years.

You speak of setting up this organiza
tion as a monument to those who have died‘
because of war. Please, let’s not say moll-
ument. Granite, steel, stone, these are the
things of which monuments are made. Wel
understand that they have died because,
they believed there must be a future. How
can you hope to set up a fool proof system?
a structure that like a great monument of
steel and stone will go on through ages
for the most part unchanged?

It is not this we ask of you. It is not
for this that we have faith. It is because
of this faith that we ask you to set for us
only the foundation. That is why we want
to face the issues. The foundation we want
must be staked out on a firmer basis than
the shifting opinions of today. It must cut
a way through national prejudices. On
such a foundation we could continue to
buildialtering as the future demanded.
And those after us would not find it neces-
sary to bomb it into dust because it was
inexorable

We had to tell you we have faith, faith
and the courage to realize that such an
organization as you propose cannot be set
operating in smooth hard grooves never
altering.

Give us a chanceﬁwe are willing to
take it.
