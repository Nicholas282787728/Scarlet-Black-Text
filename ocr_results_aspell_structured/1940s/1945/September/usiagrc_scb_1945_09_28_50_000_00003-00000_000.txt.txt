Toward

Tradiﬁon

Renewed

By Barbara Buckley

1n the llexL few weeks, prep-
ping will bcgin, officially initiat-
ing the preps to Grinncll. No
uverztimid or sensitive freshman
need worry, however. IL’S alli
fun, and is a hallowed tradition
around these parts.

Seniors well remember when
freshman men had a hard time
of it; when only Honor G mem-
bers could yell that "‘Buttoll‘,
prepE", from the Library stops;
when some enterprising prep had
to collect a pound of cobwebs durr
ing Hell Weel when a common
assignment was the painting over-
of the Marshalltown water tow-
ei-.

Like some of our best tradi-
tions, the real, old-fashioned Sys—
tem of prepping is no longer of
this world. Other examples are
not hard to find. It used to be,
believe it or not, that the men’s
dorms were inhabited by men,
Dibble was noted for its high
spirits; Clark housed the joul'nae
lists; Rawson had its beloved Kel-
ly Kanter annually; Gates was
known for its sereiiades; Smith
gave wonderful open houses; Lan-
gan was the home of the preps,
embryonic Grinnellians.

Merrill Park and Arbor Lake
were popular blanket party spots
at a spring evening, and house-
parties made every Saturday ever
ning- formal for someone, The
dravnng room was a place of
dignity, the piano was for classi-
cal music only, The “Zephyr” con-
ducted polls to find out feminine
opinion on the various campus
wolves.

Girls never sat with their dates
at basketball games, and, if they
defied tradition, they were booed
until they left their dates and
the
gym. Freshman women invari-
ably fcll in love with the head—
wniter in the quad dining room.
The annual freshman-sophomore
tug»of—war was a bloody‘ event.
'No or three dates with the
same girl or fellow meant that
you were going steady. Home-
coming was a wet affair.

And the Scarlet and Black was
published twice a week. ,
