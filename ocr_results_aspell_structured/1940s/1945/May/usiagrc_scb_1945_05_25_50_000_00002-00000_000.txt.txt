GRINNELL. IOWA, MAY 25, I945

Seniors State Attitudes
Toward Life At Grinnell

In an effort. to determine what
the class of 1945 has gained after
four years of college life at

Grimiell, your inquiring reporter;
asked representatives of the sen»

ior class the following question
What do you think about Grine
Bell’s policy of no fraternities
and sororities?
Mary Jean Finch: “Grinnell's
policy of no sororities and fra-
ternities has many advantages

Although you miss the cor‘npeti.,

tive spirit of the {sororities and
fraternities, the Grinnell way en-
ables you to become acquainted
with a larger number of peo—
ple."

What advantage haie
io‘und in Corinneu’s small classes?

This was answered by Edward
Long, “I believe the smaller the
class, the more personal contact
with instructors, the more learne
ed. Closer association with lead-
ership lends to stronger cooper-
ation in any field, the army, mus
sic, or the process of receiving
an education. The closer the
student to his instructor, the
easier it is for that student to
pay attention and absorb the of-
fered knowledge 7 the purpose
of going to college.”

What do you think of the sys»
tem of counseling at Grinnell?

Doris Schrodei"s opinion on
this: “The counseling system has
worked out wonderfully in my
case. It's a good idea to be able
to talk over the courses with
someone and so not be pushed
into something totally unfamil-
181‘.”

What has given you the most
fun at Griunell?

And Betty Fritz answers, “Life
in the quadrangle, with knowing
all the girls, the nightly bull
sessions, and spreads, has pro-
vided me with the most fun
during my college career."

What do you think of the four
hour course plan of study?

you 5

 

Lee Kidd answers this one by
saying, “The four hour, four
course plan of study has fuller
tioned very smoothly. It causes
less confusion. especially among
freshmen, and has succeeded aide
mirably. However, I believe in
discriminating between the val-
ues and importance of different
fields. Speech, [or instance,
should be a two hour course, and
some courses could beneficially
be lengthened into rive hours."
What aspect of the college life
has turned out to be better than
you had thought it would be?
Bobette Brown expresses niis
opinion: “The social program
this past year is the aspect of
college life that turned out to
be better than I expected. In
spite of a small ,oncssided stir
dent body, both students and fac-
ulty committees have planned a
social actiVity program that has
provided plenty of fun for all.”
