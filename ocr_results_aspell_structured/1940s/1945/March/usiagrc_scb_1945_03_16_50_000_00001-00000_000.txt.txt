most aesthetic. Cleveland took
third, with a nine count, all
judges scoring it in that position.
Caretul pruning, the elimination
of unnecessary blackouts, the
acceleration of the pace, would
have made it a serious contends

Nor were the other cottages out
in the cold. But few points sepr
aratccl them from those declared
winners. “Little Black Samba",
presented by James, was an au-
dience favorite, and came as an
especially happy gesture for the
some on children present. Main's
dream sequence had several high
spots. most of them because of
stage trappings such as their cle-
ver automobiles. “The White
Spot" (Mears) sequence was top
ical. clever in places, but needed
more overall direction and a fi»

By and large, the entire pro-
gram will offer next year's con-
tenders something to shoot at.
