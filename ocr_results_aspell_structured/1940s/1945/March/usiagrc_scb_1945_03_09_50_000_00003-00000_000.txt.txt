Qualifying, Aptitude Tests Given
April 5 and 10, “Vacation” Days

No students will go to classes
Thursday, April 5, and Tuesday.
April 10, Dean Earl D, Strong
announced this week, No, not a
vacation, and not specifically a
day or two of rest, aluiougb Mr,
Strong said that these breaks In
the routine might proVidc a hitY
of relaxation.

Test Days

These two days were set aside
by the faculty at a meeting on
Monday as “test days,” and ev-
eryone from freshman to senior
standing will be asked to take
two or three examinations vary-
ing in length from one-half hour
to three hours. They will coni-
prise four groups: 11) The col-
lege objectives in English, a for-
eign language, and science and
mathematics; (2) fine arts and
health educatio (a) mechanical
and clerical aptitude; and (4)
a summary of everything the
senior knows Since they will be
standardized tests covering a
great deal of ground, no prep-
aration is possible, Mr. Strong
Said.

The testing period is one of
three opportunities a freshman
or sophomore has to meet the
college objectives in written and
spoken English, foreign language,
and science and mathematics by
passing the qualifying examina-
tions. The other two are at the
beginning and end of the year.

Tests in the ﬁne arts and
health education made out by
those departments at Grinnell and
given for the first time to the
present freshman class this fall,
will be administered again Onl
testing days. Juniors will be‘
asked to take the tests, but Mr.
Strong said that the scores will
not affect their academic Stand»

Examinations for clerical and
mechanical aptitude will also be
given, not only to see whether a
file
clerk, Mr. Strong said, but also
testing whether a prospective
professional man or woman has
the ability to organize his work.

Gxaduam Record Exams

Last year the two graduate
record examinations, each three
hours long, were given to seniors
on a voluntary basis. This year,
Mr. Strong said, they will be
compulsory, but they will be
spread out over two days so that
a senior will not have to spend
six hours in one day on them,- as
he did last year, These tests
are designed to show the student
how he stands in comparison with
those of other colleges, to give
the college an idea of whether it
is giving the students what is
desirable, and to give graduate
schools a chance to evaluate stu-
dents on something comparable
from one institution to another,
Mr, Strong said. About fifty
graduate schools require a re-
port on these examinations for
entrance.

Tests Compulosry

The time schedule has not yet
been worked out, but already the

since the examinations are-

lfaculty has agreed chat the days
before and after “testing days"7
that is April 4, s, 9, and 11—

for not taking one ol those tests}
according to a decree by the per-‘
sonnel board, is to refuse the of-‘

,fender permission to take his fi-i
iial examinations. l
