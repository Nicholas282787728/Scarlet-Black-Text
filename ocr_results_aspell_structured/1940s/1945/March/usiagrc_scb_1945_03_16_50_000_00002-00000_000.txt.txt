The Dance Intramurals

By Herbert Prescott
My telephone rang.

“Professor Andersen speaking," came
the voice on the other end. “Satulday
night there ate the dance illtlamulals. I
didn‘t know but that you’d want to have
some pictures takelli I don’t know mucll
about What there’s going to be. You see,‘
each cottage does ,its own work, and the
idea is kept secret Some years, they do
really, quite splendid things. And they work
so hard.”

lerybody u 5 interested in them,

lude to the whole business.

Editorials should have a point. Here’s
the point right ,l‘lOWﬁtl'le dance illtramurals
were rather wonderful.

They were wonderful because (1) ev-
(2) studs
lng together created somethinga'
set ideas into beauty, (3) the end result
gave enjoyment not only to the participants
but to hundreds of spectatols.

Rehealsal after ,
surely followed technical
lling. Members of various cottages inevit—
ably learned a lot about each other. Friellde
ships must have been formed And while
the rivalry was clearly intense among
groups, from all reports never did that
competitive spirit descend to juvenile
feuding.

While members of any one dance group.
lleverrgot' the total effect of that presenta-
tion, they WERE out front for the other
numbers. They saw and experienced the!
giving of life to a concept through musicl
and dance.

The audience itself was completely won.‘
It was a large audience, and one that paidl
real money to see the show. It contained
student, faculty, and community rrepresent-
atives Many of them put their quaiters
into the till with a sense of obligation.
They should be praised for that. 1 some
times think that money talks significantly
when co-operation is the theme, Praise be,
then, to those who came, twenty—five cent
pieces ill hand, because they thought they
