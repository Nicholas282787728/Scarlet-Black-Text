sessions were destroyed in the
blaze, according to Gerry ROSS,
student ‘council president, who
was in charge of collecting the
student contributions.

Van Draska, who has been on
the college maintenance staff for
18 years, was on duty at the time

ture of the affair, as well as in
representation of many former
students who knew Roy well and
would want to show appreciation
of his iintiring services to the
fullest extent.
