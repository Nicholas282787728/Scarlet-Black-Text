Sideline Speculations and

Intramural

By Joan Kicfer and Twyliah
Hamsmet

Wednesday afternoon saw a very
decisive opening to the volelyball
round robin tournament. Homes
won a comfortable victory from
Mears, 45 to 22, while James
waltzed off with the James-Main
game to the tune of 70 to 13.
Question: What will happen when
James plays Hames?

That question will be answered
Saturday ,along with five others
from the same category, for Sat:
urday afternoon will see six of
the tournament games played off
in Darby gym. Read will play
Mears, Cleveland and Main will
clash, then there’s the James
Haines game, Cleveland versus
Read, Haines against Main, and
Mears will oppose James.

As for the teams, its hard
to tell anything about their relv
ative strength because not all
of them have played, but the
upperclass halls seem to be
pretty evenly matched. Cleveland,
lhy merit of its powerful hockey
and basketball players, should
have' a pretty potent volleyball
team. Mears will probably play

in inspired spurts, as they havel

in other tournaments, but from
the whipping Main took from
James, it looks as if they won't

Congress Reform
,A’r Vo‘ler's League‘

;Professor R. H. Norton Spoke on
“The Reorganization of Congress”
Monday night at a joint meeting,
,of the town and college Leagies
lot Women Voters.
; Mr. Norton pointed out that
our congress was organized to
deal with the stable, agricultural,
society of the eighteenth ccnel
ltury, not with the dynamic, in-
‘duStrial society of today. As a
result, more and more govern-
ment responsibility has descended
upon the executive department,
‘ Mr. Norton also stated that
“Congress has not initiated one
important measure on a vital is-
sue since 1929. A great many of
the laws passed have been
l‘blanket' measures leaving much
’of the detail to be determined by
the executive or the body which
,administers them."

Congressional reform can be
lhad by calling a constitutional
lconvention or by reform meas-
.ures passed by congress itself.
Recently a committee of both
‘houses and both parties has been
formed to consider this Since
nothing can reverse the change
,to centralized government, cone
lgress will have to change to
,conform with the new needs con-
fronting it,

The college league will meet
.Monday, April 2, in James parlor.
