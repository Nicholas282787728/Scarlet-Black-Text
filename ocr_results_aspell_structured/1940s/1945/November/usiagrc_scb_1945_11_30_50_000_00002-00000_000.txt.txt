Merry Christmas To All - - '

Everyone will agree that Christmas of
1945 will see this old world of ours in
somewhat of a chaotic condition. Side-
stepping world politics, atomic bombs, and
problems of occupational forces and peace-

' time conscription, let us turn for a moment
to examine this intangible quality, "moral
leadership”

This term has been used pretty freely
and smugly by us Americans, who like to
think of our nation as the great helping
hand, and the righteous benefactor. We
have been quick to accuse other nations,
whose policies have seemed to be “against
the rules of fair play,” or "un—Christian."
The. big fallacy involved here is that we
have failed to examine our own conduct in
the eyes of other nations, simply because
We say, “Oh, this is different; we’re fight-
ing for freedom l”

Yes, we fought for freedom, and we
were victorious in battle. Now we face a
problem which will sorely test this great
Christianity-professing ‘ nation of ours.
Literally millions of people will starve and
freeze to death this winter unless they re—
ceive aid from us. These human beings
aren't fighting for freedomﬁthey are in—

Consiance Rounds

 

volved in a struggle "for their lives!’ Pro—
mises won’t help. Treaties won’t
Sympathy won’t help Warm clothing,
slloes, food, and monetary donations will
help!

Here’s our golden opportunity to prove
to the world that we are truly uorthy to be
called the “moral leader" of the world. Here
are fellow human beings ill real need, and
herc are we, warm and Comfortable, uell-
led and happy! Let's divide up this Chi" tr
mas. Let’s try all ahontrl'ace and show the
peoples of the “arid tllnt the ternr,
“Christiallrspi ' ” and “Cl‘II‘lStI‘ﬂRSrSDll t”
aren’t mere words, but actual living prin—
ciples upon which we base our lives!

Again, ‘The Social Calendar .

As the time approaches for scheduling
of second semester social events, we wih
to reiterate our beiiel' that there is a .grm
ing need in Glinnell [or the revival of God-
abonts—n centralized and olganized body
to conduct a part of the campus social
activities.

The new social calendar will be drawn
up either before or immediately following
Christmas recess. The inflexibility ol' the
present “social” calendar points the prob-
lem that may arise next semester if stu-
dents then seek a change. If we are to
have such an organization as Gadabouts
now is the time to organize it.

The registrar estimates that approxi-
mately 76 more men will enter at the be—
ginning of next semester. With this step
toward equalization of the ratio between
men and women, the scheduling of more
dances seems desirable. These dances could
be handled by the social budget or’some
similar organization, but the
burden placed upon such groups by the de
tails of dance management is uncalle'd fo

By the establishment of Gddabouts, espe~ .1

cially chosen and equipped to handle such
affairs, organizations with other jobs on
campus would be relieved of the respon-
sibility.

Gadabouts was supervised by the Stu-
dent Council, during the last two years of
its existence. This seemed to be the most
satisfactory plan for auditing its‘books and
checking upon its activities. Student Coun-
cil representatives of cottages, halls, and
classes, can, through concerted action, re—
establish this institution. It can be done

before a static social calendar for second '

semester is frozen upon the records
