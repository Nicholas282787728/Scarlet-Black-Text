“Watch Dibble Hall's siiiokc

mark which echoed through halls,
stairways, and rooms, as 26 Dib-

of an empty room on first floor,

suite occupied by their new housce

herself right at home, and is al»

It looks as if her suitc may well

FASHION
FLASHES

By Anne neuebusch

“On with the dance; let joy be
unconfined." With these immor-
tal Wolds ringing in their ears,
Grinnell lassies swished off to
the dance in the bestdookin' eve-
irling dresses we've seen en masse
in a long, long time.

Sophistication reared its know-
ing head in the predominance of
black formals. Looking very
suave indeed was “Queenie" Hat-
tie Bedell in a black fitted num<
ber set off by starehed white
lace at the neckline. Babs Ma-
ooubrey ﬂoated through the ever

hing in a foamy black dress with.

wide horizontal bands of
quoise; Jane shell enhanced
simple fitted job with
shoulder straps and a
hubbaehubba neckline.

A dramatic touch was given
Gerry Warren's black dress by a
charti-euse top sprinkled with
black sequins and miss-crossed in
a bold black plaid; Tommie Lar-
sen was svelte in a filmy black
strapless net; and a black taffeta
top with a net skirt formed a
swish partnership in Ellen Van
Tiger’s gown.

Phyllis Pincus rustled in stiff
black taffeta with triangular in
sets of pale blue in the skirt.
Myrtle Cook's black topped for-
mal ending in a floaty white skirt
with appliqued scrolls of black
was something to covet, and Bar
bara Bollum set off her plain
black formal with super-smooth
elbow-length turquoise gloves.

Color also held its own as dem-
onstrated by Ronny Hauer's pale
blue eve‘ning dress with gold
studded cap sleeves, Lin Acker-
man‘s white taffeta with scarlet
bands as accents, and the smokey
blue chiffon worn by Susie Wy-
att. Mrs. Martin's white jersey
gown with the rippled, side drap-
ed skirt and Fran Chapman's
frosty white formal with its
saucy net peplum both looked
good enough to eat.

So while the “butterflies" are
hanging up their dancing drosse
es, pardon me while I go soak
my feet.
