Golis of courses, and lots
of Varietyiwhat more could you
ask for. In case you haven’t
already guessed, rm talking about
the sociology department under
the able guidance of John Burma,
A. B., A. M., Ph. D., and eight
sociology majors. But he doesn‘t
look that old, honest!

Departmental Goal

The goal of the department is
to study modern society in gen-
eral, and to concentrate on spe-
riiic aspects of it. If social worki
intrigues you, you might like to
know that approximately one
third of the department gradu-
ates go directly intc that field.

Besides its primary aim of pre—
paring students for social wel-
fare. the sociology department
attempts to give students not
concentrating in the field a gen»
oral knowledge of sociology and
an appreciation of the social
group in daily life.

The courses offered this year
include (and see how right I
am about that variety!) introduc—
tory sociology, introduction to so-
cial wclfare, social problems,
community, criminology, juvenile
delinquency, race relations, mar—
riage and the family, and social
control. The senior colloquium
studies the field in general, and
surveys areas not previously cov-
ered by class work. A cooper-
ative research project is also un-
derway.

More Courses Next Year

more about this particular de-

close and finish filling out my
blank, You've seen them—the
ones the marriage and the family
class are always puzzling over.

to show that I don't know much
about marriage either, but then
I haven't taken the course—yet.
