Speaking Of Spirit - —

It is interesteing to note, in View of the
fa that the students have been much
c cized recently for lack of school spirit,
that the faculty called off their scheduled
entertainment for All College Night last
Wednesday. Some weeks ago, several memv
bers of the faculty gave a .very entertain,
ing program at one of their faculty parties,
They became ,rinterested ill, and even of-
fered, to plusent it to the students. So
the arrangements were made—And what
happened?

Within a week of their scheduled ap-
pearance it was suddenly announced that
the facuulty was going to let their part of
the entertainment drop through, Certainly
the students would be reproved for such an
apparently lackadaisical interest in school
affairs if they had done something like
this. Perhaps the reason for such student
lethargy in many campus affairs can be
traced to the attitude of indifference which
the faculty seems to have adopted.

The faculty and student body shouldc
form an intergal whole. We do share a
great deal of our time together in the class
room and in conference. But there is very
little social life to be shared between the
two groups. That may be the trouble, The
faculty may feel that it does not dare step
out of its atmosphere of austere and regal
dignity—should not permit itself to indulge
in some genuine fun in front of its stud~
ents.

If this is the case, I think the faculty
forgets the “good old days” of the Faculty
Foolies, when they wouldn’t hesitate to do
anything to provide some good entertain
ment and to slyly get back at a number
of their students. And if they do feel that
they shouuldn’t “indulge” in front of the
students, it would seem that they are cast—
ing a slur upon our maturity.

We realize that the teachers have a
different side of life than we see ill classes.
We know they are more than mere autorl

 

mats of learning.

They may think that we look upon them
as Exelnplars for daily living and set them
up as standards by which we may conduct
ourselves. Perhaps we do. But they are
sorely mistaken if they think that we
would be “shocked immeasurably" to see a
faculty member making a fool of himself
once in awhile.

Rather than hurt anything, it would
probably come nearer emphasizing their
human tendencies and make the students
realize even more that the teachers aren't
so terribly different than we ourselves are.

It would be too bad if the faculty were
to complain lack of time as an excuse. We
could come right back with their stock
phrases when we try explaining a late
paper to them. If anyone is uncertain of
the attitude of the faculty over the time
element let him try explaining just once
why he's late to class. No, the time .elc-
ment wouldn’t be a very good approach.

Whatever the reason may be, couldn’t
the faculty re-consider? There are still a
good many weeks to go before school‘s out.

A’r Leasl Try - -

A few weeks ago the qualifications and
prizes for this year‘s annual creative arts
contest were announced. Since every Grin-
nell student is eligible to enter some of his
work done this year, and since the cash
prizes are large, it is hoped that many stud<
cuts will contribute to the contest.

Such is not usually the case, however,
since it seems that students must be made
to realize the practical ‘value in entering
the contests before much competition is
offered.

Perhaps the monetary fact that in the
Whitcomb poetry contest three prizes
amounting to $150 are to be given, and
cash prizes in the field of prose writing
and visual arts will be awarded, is not
enough to warrant a great amount of in-
terest from the student body. =

What are some other reasons aside from
the cash prizes for entering the art cone
tests? Even if you don‘t win, you have
the satisfaction of knowing that you were
neither lazy nor afraid to enter some of
your own work in the contest. Many stud-
ents seem to think it’s too much bother
to select or even write some literary piece
and actually submit it at this late date.
Others are afraid they‘ll lose and appar»
ently don’t believe they’ll be able to stand
the shock.

The final entrance date for the Whit—
comb poetry contest is April 23. The Steinc
er creative art contest closes May 10. We
hope many students will enter these con-
tests and offer some tough competition so
that no lone contestant will walk away
with the prizes. To parodize a very old
saying, ”It’s not so much whether you win
or lose," but it’s that you tried.

Hassler, Engelken
Report on Hungary
Al‘ Voters League

“Report on Hungary” was the
topic presented Monday night to
the League of Women Voters by
Ruth Hasslcr, names sophomore,
and Diana Engelken, Main fresh-
man.

This report covered the history
and development of Hungary be-
fore 1941, given by Miss Engel-
ken, and the part Hungary has
played in the European conflict
since that date, told by Miss
Hasslcr.

Germany seized the nerve cen-
ters of civll and milltary admin»
istrauon and paralyzed Hungary
in all attempts to act independ-
ently. Finally a pact was signed
“‘hopmg to rid the country of
Nazi oppression, to no avail,”
said Miss Hassler. Since then
Hungary rapidly fell under Ger-
man control and has only recent—
ly been partially recovered from
the Germans by Russia’s armies.

Tile weekly news report was
given by Martha Copley, Cleve—
land freshman.

Dorm Life Theme
Of Brief Music

Brie! Music, the Grlnnell college
theater production to be present»
ed April 17 by a cast of seven
girls, is a story of mllcge life . . .
more particularly, of dormitory
life. It takes the casts’ seven
members through three years of
lcnllcgc, from their sophomore to
lfhclr senior years,
The problems presented are
those close to a. college girl's life
study, participation in u
play, filling out questionaires. The
girls hold a typical hen—party af~
ter the prom to hash over the
evening's events, and two of them
{all for the attractive young pm-
fessor. ~

All types of college girls are
represented in the chat . . . the
eternal leftrwinger, the intellectu-
al, who tries to hide her talents,
the budding genius, the hanger-
|on who never quite crashes the
inner circle, the horn leader who
attempts to solve the problems
of her bewildered friends. The
seven girls are as different and
yet as alike as possible . . . ln'
the manner of today's coed.

The girls are made to realize
the advantages of their academ~
lc Jlfe when a. friend who was
once one of them comes back
from’ a, home and husband. not
to regret her marriage, but to
point out to her former classy
mates the desirability of their
positions.

The cast is 3’5 follows: Mary
Ann Hursh, Drizzle; Roberta
Ward, Maggie; Maxine Hay, Mini
nie; Phyllls Pincus, R05 Doris
Marvin, Jinx; Natalie Kenyon,
Lovie; Carol Kolp, Alexander.
