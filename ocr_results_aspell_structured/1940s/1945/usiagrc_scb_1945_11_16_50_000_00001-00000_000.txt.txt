“The magical spirit of a God-
given capitalism is not the only
power that can run machines,"
stated Richard Wright. J

Selecting as his key solution
to the race problem the eventual
occurance of class struggles,
wright declared that the hope of
the Negro in America lay in the
trade union movement.

Informal discussion following
his address centered upon the
means of aiding the Negro and
the eventual outcome of race cons
flict. College students, he point-l
ed out. may most effectively aid
the cause by affiliation with
strong groups such as the C10"
More changing of poll tax laws
will not better the basic problem
of the Negro.

Known as Kelly Stables, since
a memorable trip by a group of
Rawson min to a Chicago club
at the same name, Rawson hall
once held their Canter as one of
the highrspots of the social year
at Grinnell. The last Canter,
given in the fall of 1942, was in
Carney house, where a wande-
pleted Rawson was valianuy cerv
rying on.

Now that Rawson has become
a women’s hall, the last of the
oldeguard Rawson men, recently
returned to Grinnell, watch with
interest the efforts of the new
occupants of the sacred stables
to revive the tradition.

Says John Moon: “I think
that. it is a fine idea. . . I'd like
to go After all .those girls live

there now. If they can carry it
off successfully, more power to
them."

Adds John Spencer, the other
half of the remaining Kelly can»

tingcnt: "Great idea. i hope
that they can do it justice."
