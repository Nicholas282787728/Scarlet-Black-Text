Wash, DC. Nov. iz: I shook
hands with my first United
states President today. as one of
a small group present at the SDX
news conference with President
Truman in his White House study.

The president, self~assured.
easyrmzmilered and affable, sur—
prised me by his sincere friend-
liness, Cpemng the conference
with a genial “Fire away." he
later added. “If I had my way.
all aspiring journalists would be
broken in on a police beat".

He stressed the need for more
sheer accuracy in newspaper
training. even suggesting that
many presentrday columnists
might lack mat accuracy.

Later today. W. W. Waymack,
former editor of the Des Moines
Register, addressed some 300
undergraduate and professional

Flu Shot Response
“Gratifying”iswan;
Approach 100% Goal

“I have felt that the response
in the flu inoculation program
'has been very gratifying. and 1
couldn’t have asked for better
cooperation," stated Miss Flor-
ence Swan, resident nurse, con-
cerning the recent immunization
of the student body.

Flu shoes have been given to
1265 of the campus personnel
during the past two weeks. One
hundred per cent immunization
is urged. and shots will continue
to be given by appointment until
Sunday. Nov. 23.

Last year only seven people
were hospitalized from Dec. 1-
19. while the previous year when
shots were not given, 61 students
were hospitalized during the same
period. No cases of pneumonia
occurred last year. while there
were five in 1945. This sharp de-
crease is attrihuted to the flu
inoculations.

Vaccine alone has cost the col~
lege $1009.30, plus a doctor’s fee
of 50c per inoculation. In addi-
tion. there were supply expenses
of cotton. needles. alcohol and
syringes. The total cost per in-
oculation is $1.15. of which the
student pays 50c, the college bearr
ing the remainder of the expense.

Referring to the preps as “red

invite him to attend the next
meeting of the league. “so he

bum turns up, the league has
voted unanimously to make him

Developing the subject “Re-
ligion Discovering the individual".
Allch G. Wehrii, professaor of Old
Testament literature at Eden
Theological seminary. Webster
Gro‘ves. Mo. brought to a close
the 1947 Gates lectures in Her-
rick chapel yesterday.

Dr. Wehrli conducted the fiVe~
lecture series on the general
theme “The Impact of Prophetic.
Religion on Contemporary Life".
Throughout the talks he used
various passages and examples
from early Biblical lore. illustiat-
ing the history of prophetic
thought and its influence on re»
ligion of the present day.

In his first lecture at 'an au-
college convocation in Darby
‘gymllasillm. Dr, Wehrh exptained
the ecstatic forces of life as
“temporary states by which men
are obsessed". and said that
under certain spells of ecstasy
men can do things which they
ordinarily are unable to acom~
plish.

Dr. \Ve ~li's next lecture re-
minded his audience that there
was a time when written scrip-
ture was unknown and. during
that era, it was the prophets who
led in the religious motivation of
the people. These men were the
accepted authorities and were
sought out by all for their opin-
ions.

“There can be no religion." Mr.
Wehrii said in his third lecture.
