SXME OLD QUESTION - —

Yes, the same old question has come up
again, but don’t turn to another page cause
this time something new has been added.
The question? The honor system. What’s
new 27 Well, we aren’t just talking about it
anymore e we‘re doing something about it.
All you upperclassmen know what we mean
by tlle honor system. But for the benefit of
the freshmen we’d like to explain a little.

All honor spstem is a system whereby stu-
dents who offend against college rules are
dealt with by a student goVernment, not a
facility body. In this manner, students who
succeeed in pulling the wool over professors’
eyes wﬂ'l cease to get by, for the student body
will work together to obliterate this very
tlling. Not only will such a system elimir
nate cheating, cribbing, and other forms of
misconduct, but it will also make the student
a responsible person.

There are many factors contributing to
the pertinence of installing an honor system
now. The most important of these is that it
would be easier to initiate an honor system
with the present size of our student body.
Handicaps involved with a large student
body would be effaced. If the system works
now, it would, hopefully, carry over after the
war when our student body returns to its
normal size.

An honor system would place emphasis
on student government. It would be the
means of stressing the fact that students
do have responsibility ill relation to exams,
their own conduct, and so forth. Of secondary
importance is the fact that it would eliminate
misconduct, Ultimately, it would result in
lessening the number of students who “just
get by.” College life is a miniature form of
community life. If a student can’t be trust,
ed while he- is in college, can he be trusted
when he is out of college? Who-is going to
watch over him then? We aren’t children
— w e college students, remember? If
we hadn’t learned to accept and handle re-
sponsibility before we came to Grinnell, then
this is the place to learn it. In fact, this is
our last chance to prepare ourselves to be
good citizens. The community will assume
we are competent, capable adults. It won’t
teach us the right way to play our part in
social life. We must have the experience
right here.

_ One widely»voiced objection to this system
is that of students who feel that it will make
'l‘talebearers" out of them. You say, “But
if I won‘t report a girl to a professor for ci‘ib’
blng, why should I report her under the hon-
or system" Would you approve of an'anti-

ODDlTORIAL — —

Since the announcement of the planned with»,
drui‘ al of the larger part of the amiy units“
on this campus I'or nth year, there ha been
ii great deal of discussion, formal and illl'ol»
mal, on just what the old school “ill be like
when n September rolls ‘ound. Some of
the predictions have been g nl, solnc (those
of complacent seniors) exaggeratcdly dismal.

Perhaps because we of the editorial board
are always interested ill preserving civilian
morale, perhaps because we think an apprec-
iation of the occasional humor of a war site
nation is valuable, or perhaps because we are
just feeling devilish! i we' have been think
ing about some of the situations “WAR lN
GRINNELL” has produced

Such situations are not unworthy of a per»
manent place in the all-college memoirs.

F’rninstance 7 what hilt a war could have
made Grinnell students positively nostalgic
[or the particular and peculiar odor of ARH
hallways? 0r rendered it possible for ex-
Clurli and Dibble men to live with compara’
tivc lack of mayhem under the same roof?
0r allowed the Gates Sweetheart Song to be
rendered, mistly, by an exclusively female
choir? And there are people on this camr
pus today who have never heard Little Eaton
give with the ‘Oh—Oh‘ on the second chorus
of 'Row, Row, Row.’ There are briefly, peo-
ple who just ain‘t lived!

At the reunion of 1960, someone is going
to approach R; Homer Norton and remind
him of his healthy, breathless appearance as
he panted into James basement at 10 :40 after
sprinting across campus from third floori
ARH ill 10 seconds, flat 7 seconds, not N012,
ton. Someone is going to boast of being in
the only econ classes ever to meet in Good-
now. Someone, we hope, is going to prove
Grinnell’s adaptability by reminiscing about
speech classes in the Rec room 7 sandwichr
ed between a juke box and a coke machine.

Someone is going to remember when
(plug) the S & B staff carried on, even when
the staff members were the last to be in-
formed of lust where the S & B office was,

And what stories we are going to have
about the White House campaign, and the
year that Student Leaders wore leg—makeup,
and when the student who offered to rent
his place in the library had a better business!
deal than he realized!

Maybe we had better accumulate docile,
mentai‘y proof of some of these things —1
because when we tell the next college gener-
ation that we were there when the pl'esidentl
of the student council got up ill a public
meeting alld begged us to go to the Student
Center more often, and spend nlore money 7
well, they just aren’t going to believe us!

But the cream of the whole crop of “War
Stories" we may tell will depend on \ lethel‘
the present plans for shifting the 5 into
the dorms one year, while the quad is redec
orated, go through. If that happens, on top
of our already having been accustomed to
men in the quadrangle, we will have absoA

lutely THE 131-45 experience ol‘ a century of 7

college histor . Looking into the shining
faces of the Chips of 1960, we can unhesitat—
ingly assure them that we were here when
their father was a Read boy, and their moth—
er a Dibble girl.

For chances like that, we are tempted to
challenge Sherman’s opinion of war.
