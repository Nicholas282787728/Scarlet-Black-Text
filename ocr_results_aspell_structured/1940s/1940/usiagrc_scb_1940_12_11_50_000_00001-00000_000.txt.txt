the Alumni Recitation hail audi<
torium Saturday morning to hear
Herschel M. Colbert, director of
radio publicity and programs, out—
line plans for work in the new
radio studio which is under con-
struction here.

Although the studio will not be
completed until the first part of
next year, there is much work to
do in preparing programs. “We
need two good announcers and
program directors, electricians,
actors, sound etfects men, and all
the script writers we can get,”he
said.

of Iowa State college, has prom-
ised the future Grmnell station
one half hour of its time every
week Emphasizing unity, Mr.

programs for this half hour must
be developed with a controlling
idea in mind, bringing in music,
skits, and lectures in connection
with this idea.

At the end of his talk he dis-
tributed material to the aspiring
script writers which is to be
written into scripts and returned
to him as a. test of their abili-
tiss.

Freshman Trips

Prexy Stevens
In Name Test

By Clyde Bales.
if you are one of the many Grin-
ncll students whose chances of get-
ting past this semester's work are
growing slimmer than the Waist-
line cf a 1900 hello, you will be
glad to hear this tale of the
mighty who also stumbled.
Sometime ago Pres. Samuel N.
Stevens issued a challenge to the
entire freshman class to the effect
that he, Stevens, would tell the
student's name, home town, {as
ther's name and occupation, if in
turn the student would name for
him the six presidents of Grmnell
college, and certain other historic-
al facts concerning the institution,
Monday morning, Catherine
Funk, Meal’s freshman, quizzed
the president, and he fiunhed as
gracefully as the newest prep at
midssemesteri
Stevens sailed smoothly over the
prep’s name, and hurdled the home
town barrier, but he was spiked
severely on the name of the fresh-
man parent.
"Ah—Mr.
hopefully.
But when it came to the Docus
pction of Miss Funk‘s father.
Stevens was completely lost. He
confessed his failure and wrote the
affair off as a poor investment.

They Call Him

Sammy SleVens
Al ihe Shop

There is one name which Samuel
N. Stevens never misspells and
that name, reasonably enough, is
Samuel N. Stevens.

"My friends call me Sammy,"
Stevens said. He indicated also
that ,the more formal title was
tiresome to him.

“I get tired of spelling my own
name," he said. “All day long I
spoil it. It's driving me nuts."

Samuel N. Stevens is the new
linotype operator at The Herald
Register print shop, which twice
a week gives birth to the Scarlet
and Black.

Christmas at Home; Convict’s Dream Comes True

President Stevens

Chooses Winners
For Radio Show

Thanksgiving in prison,
mas at home,

This was the “dream come
true” of a young prisoner in the
New York state penitentiary.
Tile fulfillment of this dream was
made possible by Dr, Samuel N.
Stevens, president of Criniieil
college, and also consultant for
the Quaker Oats company, Spun»
sons of the program, "Your
Dreams Come True."

Dr. Stevens, who
the program, receives
10,000 letters a week

Clir'is t»

originated
nearly
and em-

ploys a staff of five readers in
Chicago, m., to examine these is-
quests fcr fulfillment of a life-
long dream of the writer.

From this mass of letters the
final “dreams," to be fulfilled and
dramatized on Sunday at 4 p. in.
over the National Broadcasting
company, is chosen by Dr. Stev-
ens.

From these thousands of letters
Dr. Stevens recently picked one
from the young convict at New
York State penitentiary, whose
”dream" was to find a job so that
he could be paroled. Dr. Stevens
investigated the writer and found
that he was a young msn of 23
years “me had been sentenced to

the penitentiary when he was 18
years old for his part in an oil
station hold-up in which an at
tendhnt was shot.

Stevens found that the prlioxh
er was an expert accountantahd

,also possessed certain mechanical

skills. After a thorough investi—
gation, Dr. Stevens says he has
located a job for the young man
in New York City, and there is
every indication that he will. be
free by Christmas.

That is only one of the thou-
sands of dramas of human emos
tion that flow in an endless
chain across the desk of Samuel
N. Stevens, who is making
“dreams come true."

School to Remodel
Present Gymnasium
lnl‘o Women‘s Center

By RllSSell Cain.

Plans for the new men's
recreational center have been
greatly revised, according toa
tall: made this morning by
Pres. Samuel h Stevens in
Herrick Chapel.

Tells of Man.

The new plan includes a men's
recreational center to be con-
structed adjacent to the west
wall of the present football slas
dium. By using this wall and re-
modeling the spacc beneath the
stadium, a new men‘s gymnasium
could be built for about 575,000,
according to the President.

The new unit would include a
basketball court. indoor track,
place for intramural competition
and the offices of the athletic de--
partment, Stevens said, The new
building will have a possible Seats
ing capacity of 2200 people and
can be used for the staging of
musical and dramatic productions.
To Remodel old Gym.

Plans for including a. recrea-
tional center and women's gym in
the one structure with the men‘s
gymnasium had to be abandoned
when architects decided such a
building would be an architectura
al monstrosity totally out of
proportion to the other buildings
