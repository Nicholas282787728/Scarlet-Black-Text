~Unclergl'acluate Thought

 

AUSTIN, Te. February 27—_
Student thought on the college
campus, like public opinion else-
where over the nation, is now
turning towards the Novvmbel‘
elections and the issues that are
likely to be involved. The collegi-
alis of the country agree with the
American voter that the most
important problem of the day is
how to keep the United states
ollt of war. Unemployment comes
next.

Interviews for the Stlldent Op-
inion Surveys asked students over
the nation “What do yoll believe
is the lnost important problem
facing the United States today?"
From every section, New England
to the deep South, Middle Atlantic
to the Far West, the answer of
the greatest number was the
same: how to stay out of war.
Many other problems were men-

.tioned, as follows:

1. Keeping the U. S. out of war
,, . 43%
2. Solving unemployment , 17
x. Balancing the budget 7
4. Solving labor problems
5. Recovery or business
6. Threats to democracy .
7. msquauty oi incomes .
8, Solving youth problems
9. The 1940 elections
10. Relief , , . 1
11. others and no opinion 21

In this instance, as has been the
case in many Surveys, college peo-
ple show practically the same sen-
timents that other studies of the
general electorate have pointed
out, The question of war and
finding employment for the jobless
are paramount in the minds of
most Americans, young and old.
Business recovery, however, seems
to be more important to the aver-
age voter, who placed that third
in the latest sampling of opinion,
while the collegians gave third
place to the budget.

Easlern Coeds
Have Big Future
But Not Too Big

H‘Tllc Coeds, Gail bless ’enl,”

Thus a Well»lillot\'ll college pro—
fessor, who ventured mil; from an
Eastern lllen's school, summarized
the coed Situation.

Not all coeds al‘e given the Same
rating though, and throughout
many Eastern schools coeds are
classed lower than it warm crawl-
ing in a subway.

At Virginia Polytecll, 2,000 men
heckle a measly 20 women, en-
rolled there because several years
ago the state legislature decided
to turn a military SChDOi into a.
coeducational institution. A stu-
dent at the collage writes, “The
one sure way to ruin a man’s
reputation, is to be seen dating a
V.P.I. coed."

In a campus survey, the Cornell
university, “Widow," Campus hu-
mor magazine, found that the
Cornell coed rated lower than low.
Highest rating in the poll was re-
ceived by students at Eastern
girls' Colleges, while Eastern fin-
ishing schools ranked second.
Middle-western coeds ran a poor
third in the group‘.

Worst situation in the country
is at City College of New York,
where less than hair a dozen girls
are on i1 campus with 7,000 men.
All the coeds are engineering stu-
dents—huff said about their da-
ting capacity.

The only eastern school we
know of where women really cre—
ate a. Sensation is Pl'inCEton, Where
one of the fair sex merely Walks
neal‘ a dormitory, and CUES of
“Fi e" pierce the air.

Third Issue of Zephyr
Will Be Out Tomorrow

The third issue of Zephyr, campus
humor magazine, will be distribut
ed tomorrow, according to John
McCune, associate editor of the
publication.

The magazine will feature car-
toons by college artists and prog-
nostications of dormitory elections.
