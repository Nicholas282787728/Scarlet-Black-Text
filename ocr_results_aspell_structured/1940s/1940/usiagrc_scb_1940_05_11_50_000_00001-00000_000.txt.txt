Vandalism Drive

Clark's Social
Privileges Denied
By Adminis’rra’rion

Administrative action as a re-
sult of tlle recent outbreak of
Vandalism occurring in the
men’s halls and on the
campus was continued Thursday
when the Administrative commit:
.tcc approved the suspension of
Dibble hairs social pi‘ ilegcs and
suspended the social privileges of
Clark hall. Shelton L. Beatty,
dean of men, stated.

Further action taken by the
committee includes the dropping
of one man from thc college, the
suspension of two men from col»
logo for one week, suspension of
one man from coming on the
men's campus for one week, and
the placement of seven men in
Clark on conduct probation. Five
voting memberships were given to
student officers in the meeting of
the Administration committee
dealing with the situation.
Conditions For Parties.

Dean Beatty stated this morn-
ing that all individual damage re-
ports must be paid in cash to the
treasurers office by noon Mon-
day; adding that if this condition
is met, the halls will be permitted
to hold their spring house parties.
All other social privileges, how-
ever, have been cancelled for the
remainder of the year.

Men on conduct probation and
under suspension are forbidden to
attend the house parties, he said.
Individual cases will be reviewed
in June by the Administrative and
Curriculum committees. Further
action will be taken at that time.
o of H P Opinion.

Dean Beatty pointed out that
the individual damage assessments
in the past have saved the men of
the dormitory over‘ $600 in one
year as compared with damages
for any year before these in-
dividual forms were adopted,

It is the opinion of the Council
of House Presidents that ”any
vandalism directly traceable to
the men of Giinnell college should
be paid by the actual offenders
when they can be determined. In
cases in which the offenders are
not known, the damages should be
paid on a pro-rata basis from the
men’s social fee," Gerald Fort,
president of the group, stated.

Professors Are Rated in Eight Groups; Fatherly Type
Is Common~Always Giving His Students ‘Pop’ Quizzes

ATLANTA, Ga.—(ACB)7The
Emery Wheel, newspaper of Em-
orv university declaring that
“since the pl‘oﬁessors divide Stu»
dents into classes it is safe to
assume that all professors can
also be divided into classes,” of-
fers these groupings: (Some of
these types indicate that profes-
sorial talent in the deep South is
not unlike the Grinnell variety.)

1. The Killer type. He wants to
kill off the lower third and thinks
the best way is by oveiwoi- .

2. The Card type. He is a card,

but not an ace. He's a 3x5 card.

3, The Spicy type. He has alot
of cheek and plenty of tongue to
put in it, His lectures kick up in-
tellectual sparks out of the aca-
demic flint.

4. The Fotherly type. He is the
unexpected father, always giving
pop quizzes. (Sorry!)

5. The Hard Rock type. You
have to be more than a good mu-
sician to hit a high C under this
joker. If he were a movie critic
he wouldn't even give the United
states flag 48 stars.

6. The Skimmer type. The
surfacing in his courses is fine.
But the foundation is weak.

7. The Uh—Man type. He doesn’t
know any punctuation except
“uh." For variety he throws in a
“but uh" now and then.

3, The Cocktail typc. He whets
your intellectual appetite (poke).
He knows a great dciilbut doesn't
try to make everybody realize it.

OptionaliThe Nomad type.
Like the Nomad of the desert he
loves to wonder, and what he
wanders over is as dry as the
desert,
