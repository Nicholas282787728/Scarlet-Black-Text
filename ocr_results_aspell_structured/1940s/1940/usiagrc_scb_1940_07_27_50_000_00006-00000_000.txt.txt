The real and living questions 01 youth! Every year there are
thousands at young people seeking assistance in answering questions
vital to them. Since each student is 2t unique individual, the answers
in 6 Ln case have to be determined in the light of facts about the
particular student and about his particular situation. The student
and his family are frequently not in a position to secure the facts nor
to interpret them properly. The decisions should be based upon some
plete and accurate information and it is further necessary that this
information be interpreted to tile‘studcnt by persons with adequate
training and experience. College has provided the facilities
and the trained persons in establishing t1 guidance clinic called the

Counseling-and Testing- Bureau.
