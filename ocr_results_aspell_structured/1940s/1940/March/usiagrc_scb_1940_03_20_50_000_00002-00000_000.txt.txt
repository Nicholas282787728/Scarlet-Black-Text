IN RETROSPECT

Now the curtain falls; the next issue of the
Scarlet and Black will be published under
new leadership. As the present editorial
board takes its final bow, we who are mem
bers of it would like to glance into the past
for a hasty review of what we’ve done.

Early in the year, we printed our policy.
“Vlake Grinnell a better place for the Grin-
nell student.” Throughout the year, we’ve
followed that policy wherever it’s led ns——
to the Student Council, to the chapel plat-
form, to the Brooklyn Conference, and even
to the deans’ offices.

That slogan phrased our belief that this
college is for students, for Grinnell students.
And we tried to put meaning into that be-
lief by restrictng ourselves to commits top-
ics, by worktop with more than words, and
by keeping quiet when [t was to the stilt]-
clits’ advantage.

Of the 72 editorials written here in Grin»
nell, only five have dealt with off-the
campus subjects. and they hare been pe»
tinent to us Remember “Are You Gal »
blc?”k'ni expose of current propaganda
And the colrlmellt on the American Youth
Congress, "Cooking Their Goose,” was re
printed in the Des Moines Tribune.

But when we came to campus topics, we
didn’t confine ourselves to comment. We
didn’t stop with words, We tried to do
something about our convictions. The edi-
torial board was even more active in the
Brooklyn Conference than three entire edis
torial columns alld two editorials might in-
dicate. And we’re still silently following
through to help the resulting student gov-
ernment clarification intoVeffect.

movies is not that they glorify vice and
crime, but rather that they fail to glorify
anything. We have had to learn that adults
do not think, feel, and behave as the movies
instructed us they did; and we have had to
learn chiefly that the philosophy to be ins
[erred from them is lnawkisll and false, the
problems treated trivial or non-existent, and
the set of values a feeble acquiescence to the
equally feeble standards of the great middle
class. We have had, in short, to rid our-
selves of sentimentality. We go to movies
no longer to be thrilled, no longer to be in
structed, bllt to relax, to be amused by the
slush and the mugging by which we were
once taken in,

There are exceptions. There have been
since the advent of the silver screen a few
great pictures, and of these “Grapes of
Wrath" is surely one of the greatest. It is
great for its beautiful photography and for
its attempt to present a contemporary prob-
lelll impartially, but primarily it is great for
its inspired interpretation of character. We
shall not soon forget Jane Dal-well as Ma
Joad, As all great art must do, "Grapes
of Wrath" did more than ask a question;
by making great characters live, by assert-
ing that such characters do exist, it has in
part given an answer to the question. If it
had been merely propaganda or merely sen-
sationalisn’l, it could not have been the pic-
ture it was

But do we believe what Steinbeck and
those who interpreted his novel have at-
temptcd to assert? Once it was easiest to
be sentimental; now it is easiest to be a
cynic, our generation in attempting to dis»
card false values has too generally become
unable to recognize what Values do remainl
We are proud of our cynicism, proud that
there is so little ill which we believe. We
are proud, almost, that he can see a picture
like “Grapes of Wrath” and go home un-
moved.
