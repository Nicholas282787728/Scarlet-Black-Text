THE KISS OF DEATH

Hardly had the last corpse stiffened in the
snow of tile Finnish battleground this week
when the German and Russian gloved hands
of diplomatic coercion reached out for yet
another victim among the smaller nations
of Europe.

Now it is Rumania that appears as the
object of the ardent wooing of the Nazi and

Glee Club
Plans Party

Red diplomats, but again the honeyed words
and tempting promises slither out through
bloody fangs. Russia and Germany have
proffered the hand of friendship, mean—
while harboring thoughts of an eventual
marriage of convenience as their affection
increases. As for the token of friendship,
that will soon become a dowry, they merely
ask that Rumania sever connections with
her past suitors, France and England, and
evidence her good intentions by doing- the
rather unladylike Job of oiling the German
and Russian war machines parked outside
her door.

To the Rumdnians, the present situation
must present hardly it glimmer of hope.
Upon the one side, behind the gloved hands,
are the rapacious claws of two nations that
have gone increasingly mad for conquest as
they have tasted the blood of their victims.
0n the other side are France and England,
two nations whose friendship and alliances
have been as glaring examples of spineless»
ness and dishonor as international perfidy
has ever thrust upon the European scene.

And who is there to save Rumania from
the claws of the totalitarian powers and the
kiss of death that France and England have
bestowed upon her brow ".7 There is but one,
Italy, the messenger of civilization to the
Ethiopians and Albanians.

May we not wonder how long it will be
before the wings of death that flashed over
Helsinki spread again over Bucharest and
another small nation vanishes into the maw
of European totalitarianism? .

the United States we don’t want more
government in education; we do want more

Gov. Leverett Saltonstall pointed out that
the major calamity of war abroad was the
crippling of education,

are important ones, They are po.
sitions that require a tremendous
amount of time, energy. and ex»
perience.

This 3 an more than any
other, We are eudeuvoring to
make those who receive the po.
sitions of editor and business
manager receive them upon the
basi of merit, ability, and c
pcrieucc, rather than upon pop-
ullu y mane. The executive
counc oi the sophomore class,
with the idea of carrying this
through, has chosen, with the
endorsement and recommenda—
tions of the publications board,
si\‘ people—three men and three
womenifor business manager,
and four people—two men and
two woman—for editor, whom
they deem most capable of malt.
ing the 1941 cyclone a success.

Their choices are based upon
the interest shown and the work
done on the annual this year, plus
previous experience and all-
around ability, These ten candi-
dates will be submitted to the

 

meeting March 4.

 

class for a vote. The three in each

 

office receiving the largest num-
ber of votes will again be submit-
ted to the class for a final vote.

us make the 1941 Cyclone a truly
successful one.
