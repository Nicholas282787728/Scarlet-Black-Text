S.D.X. Stops Coed from Running
As Lady Godiva in Sweepstakes

By William Buckley.
An unnamed Griniiell
asked Sigma Delta Chi, Derby
Day sponsors, to be allowed to
participate in the Bron-n Derby
sweepstakes as Lady Godiva, but
the chapter has turned down her-
application, it was revealed today
by that organization.

Speaking for the members of
thc group, Kon Mathews, presir
dcrrt, said, “We believe that such
a performance would hui-tGriiinell
and Sigma Delta Chi, although
the incident would put Grinnell
on the map The college has been
having enough trouble from the
local American Legion, without
having local churchmen clutter up
the c llpuS with spies."

Lam Godiva is n legendniy fig»
iirc who rode through the streets
of a Europcan city to relieve the
oppression of the natives,

Mathews also pointed out this
was the first time in the twelve

coed has

years of Derby Day at Grinnell
that the event has not fallen at
the some time as Derby Day at
Churchill Downs. However, Sigma
Delta Chi seriously considered
sending a petition to Colonel Matt
Winn, prcsidcnt of Churchill
Downs, to break a time honored
tradition and move the Kentucky
Derby to May 11 to coincide with
the Grinnell holiday,

The date for Gi-inncll‘s Derby
Day was to allow the interscho-
lastic track meet to be run off
wrtli as little confusion as possi-
ble,

The sweepstakes will be run off
at 10:30 a. m. and will be fol-
lowed by a track meet in the aft-
ernoon The Brown Derby Drag
will complete the day of fun,
and will feature Red Blackburn
and his orchestra, 11 men and a
girl, along with the annual
awards, the "Black and Blue,"and
"Me and My Nightmare.”

Costuming Seen as Major Attraction of Graff Ballet;
Group Dancing More Effective than Solo Performances

By Henry Alden.

with the appearance on Wednes-
day evening in the high school
auditorium of the Graft ballet, the
Woman's Social Budget commit.
tee continued the pleasant annual
practice of sponsoring a dance
recital by a famous American
troupe.

It early became evident that
the costiiming was to he one of
the chief attractions of the eve»
ning and throughout the entertain~
mcnt the costumes, which ranged
from the delightful caricature of
the fashions of the hobbloshirt era
in "Vintage—1914" through the
resplendent finery of “Renaisc
sauce" to the weird fantasy of
the rain episode in “Singing
Earth," were a constant pleasure
to the eye.

The dancing itself was less con-
sistently admirable. Doubtless it
suffered by comparison with the

expelt performance by the Hume
pllrcerVelclnlan group last year.
The dancing of Grace and Kurt
Gi-nff was at times markedly lack-
ing in both beauty and precision;
the clioreog phy appeared to be
aimless and without purpose; many
of the routines sccmed merely rc-
pctitous. As a result of these come
hincd faults, the performance
"dragged" more than once. As
a rule, the group dancing, espe-
cially when its mood was comic
and witty as in “Villtagcilglll”
and in “Viennese Fragment," was
more effective than the sold per-
fol'milnccs,

One notable exception was “0-
dyssey" performed by Grace and
Kurt Groff. This dance was per
haps the outstanding number of
the program, partly because it c0n~
toiircd the most interesting and
successful dancing of the two
stars; partly because the music
was indissolubly joined with the

dancing itself, and mainly because
almost every step and gesture
seemed purposive and functional
in developing an idea which was
in itself oi'glual and meaningful.

Tlle last and most ambitious
offering was “Singing Earth,” an
attempt to achieve an epic of the
soil, of the germinatwe principle
in nature. Despite some effective
episodes, chiefly the bizarrc and
imaginative rain dance, this ballet
was pretentious rather than lln~
pressxveicertailtly less impressive
than its title.

All in all, however, the perfor-
mance was diverting; if it had
its dull moments, we can forget
them in grateful memory of the
high spots, for which John Pratt,
no less than the dancers them-
_selvcs, was largely responsible.
For John Pratt designed and exe»
ciited the costumes for the entire
program and created the setting
for “Odyssey.”
