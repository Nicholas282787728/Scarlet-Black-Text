Slow- Moving Play Is Seen
As Handicap To Actors

By William C Harris

Heletofole confining itself almost without e\ception to sece
ular theme, the Grinnell chapter of Pi Epsilon Delta treads

upon somewhat unfamiliar ground
in its production or “Family For
trait.” Taking its theme from
Christ’s statement that “a
prophet is not without honor save
in his own country and among his
own kin,” the play is one of the
less meritorious samples of mod~
ern religious drama,

"Family Portrait" is not a well~
written play. It is slow moving to
an extreme. 111 many places it
is trivial, stuffed with useless ba-
nalities, In other spots it is
wordily plieachy. Nowhere does the
action or the dialogue become
really gripping in its hold upon

the alldience—ox' upon the play-
ers And. as a result of the per-
petual scene-changing demanded
by the script, the limited audi

subject to continuous destruction.

at irony, only once—iii its 11eve~

In Game Tonighi

By Jack Wile.

Monmouth, Ill.~Special to
the Scarlet and Black~In a
rough scramble featured by
30 fouls, Gl'innell‘s cage team
