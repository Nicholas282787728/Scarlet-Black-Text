AUSTIN, Texasiﬂow serious is
the problem of class cutting?
Are many college students wast-
ing their time by fai'ng to ap-
pear at lectures? How often does
the average student out a class?

tions:
out no classes during \vcck..62%

Cut thrce classes . 4
Cut four or more classes. 4

Less than one per cent of the
students refused to answer the

Tests conducted by the Student
Opinion Surveys of America have
shown that on questions such as
this very few students fail to
give truthful answers; so the r
siilts above should give a sati
factory indication of conditions
over the nation.

In connection with this poll, it
may be recalled that last Febru—
ary 64 per cent of the collegians
in a Survey expressed the opinion
that compulsory class attendance
should be abolished.

Although the frequency of at-
tendance is quite uniform from
one section of the country to air
other, New Englanders and South-
erners appear to he at the two
extremes. In the northeast corner
of the nation cuts are at a mini-
mum, only 25 per cent of the
students having missed one or
more class during the week or
the poll. In the South over half
of them, 57 per cent said they
had cut at least once,

Stanton, display artist at 3
Newton theater, was invited by
the Art department to exhibit his
work during a visit last spring
to the Grinnell campus. His
prints, Miss sternfeld said, were
selected for exhibition because of
their merit in composition, tex-
ture, and interesting subject
matter.

“This prints are or particular
interest because of the quality of
work the photographer has pro-

ment," she stated. "He uses a
small, inexpensive camera, and
does his own developing."

tures to be on display include

character studies, and objects

cific coast. Among the titles are

ployed in Newton during the last

Review Cites Grinnell Philharmonic As Giving Concert
Characterized by Spritely Spirit and Infectious Gaiety

By Esther Carlson

For their first appearance of the
season, the Grinnell Philharmonic
orchestra, under the capahlc di-
rection of Robert vagncr, pre-
sented an excellent concert Tues—
day evening. A fair sized an.
dicncc attended the affair.

The concert was characterized
throughout by a spritcliness of
spirit; a ccrtain infections gaicty
which was communicated to the
audience. At times the music
rose to really inspired heights
but these moments were few and

scattered.
"The Piper of Hamelin" (John-
sonl, the musical story of the
familiar legend, was excellently
played, Every mood of the piece
could he clearly defined and the
continuity of portrayal was coni-
mendshlc. Richard Bouma’s oboe
solo as the pipct’s magic pipe.
possessed tantalizing grace.
Marked by its lilting rhythm
and “back-woodsy" flavor, "Hill—
Billy" (Could) was presented with
humor and zest. Perhaps the ills
tcrpretation of “Egmont Over-
tnTe" (Beethoven) lacked depth,

but here again, hc vivacity in
the portrayal made it an inter-
esting selection.

The presentation of Mozart's
“Symphony in C Major" needed
more grandeur and nobleness of
tone but the spirit was there and
rescued the piece from dullness.
”Harvest Hymn” (Grsinger) pose
scssed reverence and beauty.

Called hack for an encore by
an appreciative audionc , the or-
chestra played “Hill-Billy” once
more, and hon-ed thcmselves off
the stage before dicy could be
encored again.
