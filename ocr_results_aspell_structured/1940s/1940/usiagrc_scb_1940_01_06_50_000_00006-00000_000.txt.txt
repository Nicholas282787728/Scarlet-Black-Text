VACATION 013M133

During the Christmas vacation,
the Pioneers Won three and lost
one in four games played Against
Midwest contcrcnce opponents,
Griuncll kept its record clean and
climbed to thc top of the loop
standings with cleal'rcut decisions
over Lawience and cos. Dec-
ember 15, the Pioneers took thc
Vikings into camp on the local
floor, 43 to 33; while the next
evening they traveled to cedar
Rapids to down the Kohawks,
~17 to 35.

At the Marslialltown tourna-
ment, the Pioneers lost the title
won last year when they bowed to

50 to 53, after squeezing past

In perhaps the most interesting

the Pioneers just managed to eke
out a victory over a fighting

Suffering their first defeat in tour

game. Grinnell relinquished an
