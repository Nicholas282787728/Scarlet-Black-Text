ha/vings

By Jack Wl'le ——

From the looks of the football
team in its first practices it‘s
apparent that “our Ben” is really
going to set the gridiron on the
right off the hat.

a s i

There were almost as many
spectators as there were players
out for practice yesterday cite--
noon with the trend toward crow
large enough to warrant police
lines. And don't think those
spectators are just out there
to see the installation or
a new brand of football into
the g' ron history of Grinnell,
It's l‘azzlerdazzle, dingoong foot-
hall with Benny leading the par-
,atle.

s c v
If practice during the rest of
the spring training period is as
hard as it has been so far, we're
going to see some tired boys
dragging themselves a re u n d.
They’re out there to learn and its
safe to say that they’re going to
get “learned” or bust.

e i s

Something has come over those
hoys and it isn't a dark cloud.
Everyone can see it, even if they
watch only one or two plays.
Spectators, players and coaches
are all getting that little tingle
in their spine as they watch and
are watched in the shadow of
that old pig-skin. Maybe it's the
newness of the thing, but we're
going to take the hopeful attitude
and say that next year Grinnell
will have a football season,
