0 WOE IS US

Frankly, we’re worried,

We’ve chewed ollr nails through many
campus crises this year, but the problem
over which we are now tearing our hair
surpasses them all in importance. The
problem, in brief, is this: What shall we
think about during the summer vacation'.7

Now, this may not appear at first to
be fl. point worthy of editorial worry, but
if you will consider it with us for a para-
graph or two, you will surely recognize
the justification for our misgivings.

If you are an average Gl'innell student,
you carry five or six courses. Each of
them meets two or three times a week.
Your mind is divided into five or six pigeon
holes. 011 Monday, let us say, you think of
history, mathematics and harmony; on
Tuesday, however, you consider only’arch-
eology and philosophy. On Wednesday

comes again Monday's course nith perhaps
a little literature thrown in for good meas
ure. And so on through the week. You
don’t have any trouble knowing what to
think about, do you? 01' course not. The
professor tells you in class, and then you
go home and think about it. Very simple.
G

But this summer, it won’t be so simpler
There won't be any professor to tell us
what to think about On Monday, when
we wake up all ready to meditate over his-
tory, mathematics and hr’lrmony, we shall
suddenly realize that there is no longer a
need for cogitation on these subiects. Our
minds will be filled with blankness, where
once was Monday’s schedule for thought
We shrill be at a loss. You see, then, that
we have a real problem.

What to think about! We could turn
to the war, But that‘s such all unpleasant
subject; and besides our weekly schedule
has not included the war, so we don’t rea-
ly know much about it. Besides, we
haven’t had any courses on the war. Then
there’s the administration (national), which
many people outside of college seem to con-
sidcr seriously for great periods of time.
But we have been so busy thinking about
mathematics and harmony on week days and
of varsitics and house parties on weekends.
that we aren’t really prepared to do much
thinking about the administration.

G

We are left u'lth two alternativesillot
counting the obvious solution of not think-
ing at all. We could, from now until the
end of school, think a little about subjects
other than those for which we are enrolled.
We could in this way be preparing for a
little independent thought dl mg the sum-
mer, But that would, of course, take quite a
bit 01' effort and doesn’t fit into any of our
pigeon holes. So perhaps, the easiest and
most logical answer to the whole question
is to fall back on the faculty and let them
advance lls thinking schedules for the sum—
mer. They could give us about eighteen
subjects a week and we could dwell upon
three a day, and leave Sunday for thinking-
‘bout religion. The faculty is used to tells
ing us what to think about, and we‘re used
to being told, so the arrangement should he

fill summer. We can forget about what
“'1” happen to us when we leave college and
have no kindly professors to tell us what to
think about,

Commencement--

Continued from page i

As students, we are reluctant to
find fault with administrative ac—
tion. However, we feel compelled
to speak our minds in protest of
the college bringing pressure on
them not to sell beer to college
students regardless of age.

College, we have been told, is a
place where one learns how to
live. As such, it should also be
a place to learn to drink as a
gentleman drinks; and not a place
that trics to cloislcr students
from the realities of life.

”It seems clear to us that the
method used to stop the selling of
beer to college students was not
the method of a gentleman, but
not unlike that which might be
employed by Hitler’s Gestapo, Nor
do We believe that the impetus
for the action against the taverns,
which we believe 'to be an isolated
