Plan Passed

Scarlet and Black
To Receive Funds
From Semester Fee

A new plan for financing
the Scarlet and Black, as
drawn up at the Brooklyn
conference of student leaders
last fall and approved by the
Student Council after accept-
ance by the Council of House
Presidents and the Women’s
Social Budget, was passed by

the Gl'innell college board of ,

trustees at its annual Dec-
ember meeting. ‘

The proposed plan calls for fine
ancing the Scarlet and Black out
of the semester fee allotment by
a gradual increase ‘untll 1942
when the newspaper's student
circulation will be financed en-
tirely by the semester fcc fund.
Complete Plan Given.

This will necessitate reducing
the allotment to band uniforms,
the Council‘s own allotment, and
make it necessary for the .Council
of House Presidents and the W0—
men’s Social Budget to take over
the financing of the White House,
student recreational center.

The complete plan, as present-
ed to the trustees ior- approval, is
as follows:

I. That the Women's Social
Budget and the Co ncil of House
Presidents take over the financ—
ing of the White House. That
this year’s Social Budget and
Council of House Presidents re-
commend to their respective in—
coming bodies that each deduct
$250.00 from their social funds
to be given to the White House.
The appointment of and the ad~
ministration through the White
House committee of the White
House shall continue in the hands
of the student council.

II. A. That the present sup
port of the Scarlet and Black by
the general fund or the college
be abolished by reducing the sub-
sidy from the general fund" by
25¢ per student each year until
the present support of 75c per
student be abolished.
$530400 Needed.

Under the present financial
plan the Scarlet and Black re-
quires $550.00 as a subscription
from the students to operate, and
this sum is derived by taking
75c per student from the general
fund of the college. This could
be better utilized for salaries
and maintenance.

B. That the present Student
Council , recommend to future
Student Councils that the Scarlet
and Black be supported by the
semester fee in the following
manner:

Apportionment Given.

1, That 2 percent of Lhc 1940-
41 semester fee, 4 percent of the
1941-42 semester fee, and 5.5 per-
cent of thc 1942-43 semester fee
be apportioned to the Scarlet and
Black. 5.5 percent of the semes—
ter fee represents approximately
SdiOllD. This shall be considered
as the permanent plan of financ-
ing the Scarlet and Black. l

2, That any proﬁt ovcr thc
maximum set by the Publications
Board be placed in the reserve
tund oi the Publications Board.
