ARE YOU GULLIBLE?

No? Have you seen this one?

“Sir: We are accepting pulp fiction deal-
ing with the present Europeall war The
former ban on Anti—German stories has
been lifted.

“For Air Adventures we would like air
story writers to have their heroes English,
French, or American adventurers. For Fan-
tastic Adventure and Amazing Stories we
will welcome stories dealing with Nazi ill-
trigue in the United States.”

This quotation was lifted from the cor-
respondence column of the Writer’s Digest
and bears the signature of "Jerry K. West-
erfield, Assistant Editor."

And what about the recent news reel of
happy Polish prisoners being fed by the
Germans alld the clean-cut, handsome,
young German soldiers loading their bomb
racks? Or the November issue of the March
of Time, which exposed Americans to
twenty»two minutes of oral alld visual pro-
pagandaﬁlellgthy views of British fleets
accompanied by majestic music; British
naval schools sporting plaques reading
”Fear God; Honor the King ;” pathetic child—
ren, evacuated from London; churches being
sandbagged; alld statues of heroic British
admirals? Or the camera protrayal of the
moving burial service held by the British
for two German aviators killed during the
attack on the Firth of Forth?

Nor do u'c want to {org/ct the ﬁlms produce
ed by our oun movie moguls, The recent
“pictorial editorial” issued by Paramount is
a case ill point.

Entitled “The Unknown Father Talks
to His Son,” this celluloid blurb spent ten or
fifteen minutes waving the flag, damning
the dictatorsllips, and extolling the prophe-
tic vision of Washington’s Farewell Address,

Alid then there’s always the Gestapo for
Hollywood‘s convenience,

Whenever an innocent person is to be
murdered, military secrets to be filched,
or bombs to be planted it is invariably
Hitler’s agents who carry out the dastardly
deed. Latest example is found ill the pic-
ture “Everything Happens At Night”
wherein the sinister tools of the Third Reich
attempt to assassinate a Nobel peace prize
winner. Why? Just because Nazis are
supposed to run around killing peace—loving
citizens; it’s the way they work up an
appetite, according to Twentieth—Century
Fox.

But the biggest fraud
Athenia story.

Splashed across the front pages ill three-
illch headlines as being a premier example
of the brutality of submarine attacks upon
helpless passenger liners, the whole hulla-
baloo is now known to be but a colossal
piece of journalistic hokum. For according
to all ilnpartial investigation conducted by
the United States Department of State, none
of the survivors is willing to swear he saw
either a submarine or a torpedo. Instead,
expert opinion has it that the blast was
caused by an internal explosion, the current
theory beillg that while the vessel was iii
an Irish port, a bunch of Irish nationalists
planted a bomb in the boat’s innards to em—
barrass Great Britian.

G
That’s the 7'6001‘ It speaks for itself, The
filth and per el‘SIOl] of warvtinle censorship,
both allied and German, have descended up-
on us. And that record demands that we
squarely face the facts:

(1) The primary sources of European
news are the London cable offices, operating,
as are the German, under the strictest cen-
sol-ship.

(2) According to a recent Fortune
Magazine surv y, 47.8 per cent of American
readers believe solnc of the British-French
stories, while only 29.6 per cent believe
some of the German stories.

(3) That our own press, pulpit, radio,
films, and public platform are biased, either
one way or the other.

Twenty-five years ago, we had the same
problem before us. We failed to meet it. We
were taken ill by stories of handless Belgian
babies, crucified Canadian soldiers, and
Lusitania ”outrages". Since that time it
has been proved that the first two were
pure fabrications and that the Lusitania
was carrying munitions and was hence a
legitimate target.

Need we wait twenty—five years before
we wake up to the fact that this year’s
crop is composed of the same stuff?

Or have we got more sense?

OPEN FORUM

To the Editorial Board:

Appearing in this issue of the
Scarlet and Black is an editorial
entitled, “Are You Gullihle?"

It is my opinion that the arg-
uments presented therein evid—
dcnce, on the whole, more of an
anti-Allied attack than an im-
partial criticism of propaganda.

Do other readers, whose views
may more appropriately appear in
the Open Forum column, share

the same opinion?
