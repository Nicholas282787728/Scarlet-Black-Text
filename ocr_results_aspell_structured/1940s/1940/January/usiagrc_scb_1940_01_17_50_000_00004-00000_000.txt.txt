Open Forum

Continued from page 1

If you ever have the inisfora
tune to work among the less edus
cated industrial, and agricultural.
classes of American people in
plants which are in the throes of
labor trouble, you will understand
more fully the power of a press
campaign and the potency of the
above remarks. Those people
honestly believe what they read
in the newspapers.

1 hope that the remarks quoted
in this letter will, in a small
way, indicate a few reasons why
I think that any attack on prop-
aganda is justified. I agree with
the author of the editorial. 1
think that the American public
is being exposed to too much of
