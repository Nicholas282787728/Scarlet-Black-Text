Our Entry Into
European War

Seems Certain

—By William O. HArrh.

With every new development in
the world situation, the convic-
tion that we advanced last spring
in a chapel addressimat the
United States is on the road to
warehecomes more and more
firmly entrenched.

In tact, we would be extreme-
ly reluctant to wager more than
the thinnest of dimes on the prop-
osition that this country will still
be at peace upon June 1, 1941.
Merely a bad case of the jitters?
Perhaps. But many factors would
indicate a more serious basis far
this ennclusiom And of these the
most important are the hollow-
ing:

(1) The seemingly certain re-
election of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Well known is Mr. Rooseveit's
sympathy for the British cause in
the current European war. Little
knnwn,- but just as existent, is
his undercover support of those
favoring an outright alliance be-
tween Great Britain and the
United States The president has
had at least two exceedingly
sympathetic conferences with
Clarence streit, author of Union
Now and strong advocate of our
entry into the war on England's
side. Only the existence of a still~
strong isolationist opinion l'e-
strains the White House and its
satellites from open advocacy of
such an alliance. With another
four years of power in prospect
for this leadership, the conclusion
is obvious,

(2) .The world situation With
the recent announcement oil the
Japanese-Imlian-German alliance
and the momentarily expected aide
hereuce or Spain to the Axis
comes the increasing realization
that the liooseveltion toreig-n
policy has left us udth the British
Empire as our only ii-lend in a
world oi hostile aggression Espe-
cially dangerous to American
peace is the powerful position of
Japan in the Far East. With the
Royal Navy engaged in European
waters, the task of quenching
Nipponese ambitions dcvolvcs up-
on the giui-houts of Uncle Sam
And reports indicate that the
naval brass-hats of both coun-
tries are spoiling for just such
a soup.

(3) American public opinion.
Whereas in October, 1939, the
Gallup Poll reported only as per
\Cent of the people in this country
favored aid to' Great Britain at
the risk of involving the United
states in the war, more recent re~
sults from the same source claim
that 52 per cent now advocate
taking that risk. Another few
months of such a trend, and this
majority will reach an alarming
total.

(4) Our unprecedented nrma~
ment program. Although great
faith is all too oioeu placed in the
highsoundlng axiom, “Prepare for
war to secure peace," history
fails to provide any instance
where this doctrine has proved
sound Instead, it clearly shows
that the temptation to make use

of shining new military equip.

ment can easily become over-

chip can usually find a ﬁght.
