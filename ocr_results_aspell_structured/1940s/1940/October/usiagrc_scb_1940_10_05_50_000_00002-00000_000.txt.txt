O The Golliwogg’s Cake Walk

It was with some dubiousness, despite tlle
mechanical decision to let Beowulf go hang,
that we went to hear Halls Lallge and his
Little Symphony last Wednesday night.
Not that we don’t like music. Long since,
being naturally conformist, we have grown
accustomed to saying, “that was nice” after
a rendition of Haydn quartet, and “Nobody
like Tschaikowsky" after the Pathethuc.
.In short, we are accustomed to fitting
things into categories; if we are sure that
chamber music is chamber music, we know
the appropriate remark, and likew se with
symphonies played by the New York Phil-
harmonic.

But with the hybrid music one must
expect of Hans Lange and those like him,
it is another matter. They may play Bee»
thoven and they may play The Golliwog‘g’s
Cake Walk, but in either instance the Little

Symphony does not classify itself, it is a
little disconcerting to try to think of what
to say about it. There will undoubtedly be
those wllo will say they can’t stand that
thin stuff, and there will be those who Will
say, “But after all, they don’t pretend to be
the Boston Symphony." But Wednesday
night, knowing all this, we were still at a
loss. We did not know what to say, until
the people around us began saying, “Oh,
wasn’t it good”! Wasn’t it wonderful?” After
that we got along all right.

0 America’s Crystal Ball
It just occured to ils the other day that
there are no surprises left in this modern
world of ours, Not only can we be con-
fident as to what to expect every morning
for breakfast as we trudge oilr sleepy way
toward Lang-an cellal'ithat is, the few
times we do make that early morning jour-
ney—but we can now discover just e. actly
u at the American people are thinking
without even troubling to ask them.

For all we have to do is read what
Yogi Gallup has to say in the morning’s
lpress.

He told lls that we favored peace-time
conscription He has informed us we are
willing to risk war to aid Britian. And he
has let us know our ‘nnel‘most thoughts all
a host of other subjects

What‘s lnore we take him at. his word.
Why? Mainly because he and Jim Farley
were the only ones within gun-shot of real-
ity on their ’36 election guesses. We could
check up on him there, so we know he
was somewhere near accurate. And it right
once, why not always‘.7 At least, we have
no opportunity of checking his analysis of
our opinion on such issues as conscription
and aid to Britain, questions which are not
submitted to the public for an authorized
vote. So why not accept his stuff at face
value?

Maybe we should even vote as he says
the majority intends to vote. We should
hate to bet on the w ‘ong horse, especially
when Mr. Gallup says i s the wrong horse.

After all, why should we get technical
and insist that the great forecaster should
prove to us that he is only recording public
opiniongand not influencing it? 7

To The E ‘ or:

In the Friday, sept. 27th s S: B
the redoubtable Mr. William c.
Harris made the interesting ch-
servation that Willkie realizes a
scund agricultural policy is vital.
It is rather remarkable that a
candidate for the presidency of
the United States realizes such a
Vital need.

Mr. Wilikie realizes, in addi-
tion, that a sound agricultural
policy is impossible without a
éound revamping of the whole
national economy: specifically, rc-
hellilitation cf the foreign market,
granting to our unemployed the
opportunity to earn more purchas-
ing power and enabling industry
to distribute inorc wages and
profits among the urban popula-
tion. This constitutes an appre—
bcnsion’of economic reality on

the part of Mr. Willkie.

0n the other hand the New
Desi, according to Mr. Harris, has
discovered neither the need for a
sound agricultural policy nor the
dependence of such a policy on s
i‘ecasting of die whole economy.
In short the New Deal has at-
tempted to benefit farmers with
artlf isl cxpedients, the AAA,
etc, which operate on the un-
economic thccry that the income
of agriculture can be eternally
increased at public expense.

It is true, of course, that the
establishment of proper balance,
the creation of a rational system
of economy is far better from
anyone's point of View than un-
economic expedients and prom‘
cucus spending or the publi s
money. The question is in addr
lion to a recognition of this need
for essential and comprehensive
rehabilitation of the entire cccn»
only how does Mr, Winkle pro-
pose to permanently solve the
farm problem or any other as»
pect of the whole probleill? Mr.
Harris admits that he does not
know whether Willkic can effect
a permanent solution, and he does
not know how Willkie might go
about effecting it.

It is quite obvious that Mr.
VVlllkle, the erstwhile liberal who
has grown up so to speak, bee
lieves in free enterprise in every
sense of the expression, He he
lives in a. minimum of goverile
ment sllpei‘VlsiDn or control be»
cause excessive meddling means
Lhe disruption of ”natural" econ-
omic processes. He believes in
individual freedom and initiative,
because cooperation as in the case
of government and agriculture or
government and labor inhibits the
performance of the “natllra " pro~
ccsses. if Mr. Willkie believes all

this, and there is much evidence
that he does, then it should be
apparent [hit this permanent solu-
tion of the agricultural problem,
among other problems, lies in the
18th century notion of luisscc-
faire.

Mr. wilikie will, then, probably
establish his astonishing restitu-
tion of American economy by
abolishing restrictions so far as
possible by injecting the spirit
or inisscz-iuire. Anyone who has
studied the economic history of
the United States or of any other
country knows that an economy
does not actually work so simply
and frccly. Furthermore, he should
know that faith in the opera-
tion of such a benevolent natural
law has unpcdcd intelligent pro»
grcss and intelligent manipulation
of economic exigencies for at
least the past hundred years,

Ccnld this be VVilllile's Way of
inducing a sound agricultural
policy? could this be Willkie's
apprehension of economic reality?
Could it be anything else? Let us
revert With, Willkie!
