rand Young Democratic clubs of the campus,

student interest in the current national cam-
paign will reach a new high,

That sul' lent numbers of the student
body have evidenced enough interest in
political affa 's to make such all undertale
ing' possible is an encouraging sign Usually
apathetic to all subjects not concerned with
school dances and blanket palties, Grinnell
students have not displayed such conceln
with off ampns affairs in years. And it is
with satisfaction that we note this awakens
ing to the importance of national prob-
lenls.

G

After all it will be the students of to-
day who w 1 be the citizens of tomoriow,
entrusted with the task of preserving Am—
ericall democracy through ‘1 ela which
promises to be the most (1 cult ever to
confront this nation. For the collegians of
today to become aware of their responsibili-
ties bel'ore they are required to assume
them is to be prepared for the job ahead.

Whether this interest is portrayed
through membership in the Republican club
or the Democr tic club or the Socialist club
is immaterial. The fact the interest . sts
in any form is the fundamental value

G

Upon the creation and maintenance of
this alertness to national issues rests the
future welfare of what we choose to term
“the American way of life.” Thus, we say
to young politicians, one and all, “Go to it”

Attorney General’s

Ruling Seen as
Labor Vote Move

By William 0. Harris.—

Accoxdmg’ to one of the most
reliable of the Washington news-
paper columnists Attorney Gen
eral H. Jackson has just announc-
ed what he chooses to call an
"informal" ruling which may have
for reaching effects upon the
national defense program.

The substance of the ruling is
this: when the defense commis-
sion wishes to discover whether
or not c government contract for
war weapons can be fulfilled if
there is n labor dispute at the
factory in question, it must ask
the attorney general for an
opinion. And he in turn nnnounoes
that in such cases his opinion
will be based upon the findings
of the National Lnbor Relations
Board—that if that boon-d riﬂes
unfovornbly toward the employer
in question, the opinion will coil
for the suspension of the con-
troct with tho employer.

The obstructions which this
procedure places in the path of
speedy and efficient rearmament
as Well as the injustices in-
volvcd are obvious.

In the first place such a prac—
tice would place all govern-
ment defense orders at the mercy
of the National Labor Relations
Board whenever those orders
should run afoul of a labor dis-
pute. That this quasi-judicial body
is notoriously pro-labor is a mats
(er of public knowledge That the
chairman of this board, J. Warren
Madden, has confessed upon the
witness stand before a House
investigating committee that ho
had vioictcd a federal statute7
an offense for which the ac
torncy general refused to prose-
cuteiis loss generally known but
just as true. To give so biased
a group such fundnincntsl con~
trol over all contracts hompcu
ed by labor disputcs is to work
injusticc to both industry and the
government.

Secondly, in
player to give up

forcing an one
his contract

upon the more basis of an un-
favorable National Labor “42an
firms Board ruling is depriving
him of his lnwful right to appeal
any decision of the board to the
courts. Just how the attorney gen-
crnl justifies this procedure with
the low is yet to bo seem nut in
view of that gentleman's astute
”legalization" of Roosevelt's des-
troyer deal we have little doubt
that no will produce the necessary
rationalization in duc time.

Third, this decision of the heat]
of the Justicc Department cfr
fectivcly destroys the independent
authority which the New Deal has
led the public to believe is posses-
sell by the defense commission.
Months ago a group of experts,
who had given plans for the ad-
ministration of defense activities
years of study and who forsaw
such a contingency, recommended
that special boards and agencies
be created with full power to act
in all matters concerning defense
preparations. However, this report
was suppressed by the adminis—
tration, Instead, the commission
which has been established is be-
ing lismstrung thus for the sake
of the labor vote in the coming
elections.

\‘Vith the creation of n strong-
notionid defense looming as one
of the major tasks confronting
the country, it would scarcely
seem advisable to hinder the urn
nmcnt program with the obstacles
which are inhcrcnt in Mr. lack-
sun’s “informal” ruling. It i to
bl: ,hoped that the American pub—
lic will recognize this face when
they go to the polls on Novem—
