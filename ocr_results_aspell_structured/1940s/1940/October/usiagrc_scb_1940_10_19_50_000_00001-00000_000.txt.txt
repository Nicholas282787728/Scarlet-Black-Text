Deciding Margin
In Tigh’r Game

By Jack Wile.

Grinnell‘s Pioneers fell under
a fourth quarter rally staged
by the Washburn gi'idders
from Topeka, Kan, oll Ward
field last night, losing to the
Ichabods, 7 to 6.

After sweeping through a score
less first quarter, the Pioneers
gained the upper hand through a
Washburn fumble and passed
their way to a second period
touchdown. Grinnell held the lead
from then until the last five
minutes of the game, when the
Ichabods’ powerhouse finally
clicked and gave waslihurn their
touchdown and the winning extra
point.

Pioneers Held Four Times.

The Pioneers found themselves-

with their backs to the wall
four times during the game, but
the fourth period tally was the
only successful thrust, on two
occasions the Ichabods pushed
their offense down within ten
yards of the Crinnell goal be-
fore they were turned back. The
other time the Pioneers came
out of hot water was the play
in which a bad pass from center
dropped them back to their own
nine yard line and Elandin had
to kick from behind his goal
line.

Washburn backs, combined their
running and passing abilities to
give the pioneers a headache all

By Janet Brookcr.

In the opening address of the
