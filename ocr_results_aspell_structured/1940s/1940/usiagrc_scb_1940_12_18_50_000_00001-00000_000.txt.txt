tery of the written and
spoken use of English, an
adequate reading knowledge
of a modern foreign language,
an understanding of the na-
ture and method of science

biological sciences, and an ap-
preciation of the role of the

Dr. Stevens said. “In the new

Slves."

delve further into certain areas
which he has not been able to
explore under courses previously
taken," President stevens em-
phasized,

The department of journalism
will be ndjusted into the departs
ment of English. while business
administration subjects, along with
economics, will be taught by use
department of economics and com-
merce. It is hoped that erteen
hours work in both journalism
no business administration will
remain, although no definite ac-
tion has been taken by the iseul-
ty.

To PROTECT JUNIORS.

According to Dr. Stevens. un-
der the new plan, students in-
terested in journalism have ample
opportunity to acquire practical
experience in this field. Also, all
of the fundamental work now
conducted in the department of
business administration will be
maintained for the beneﬁt of
those students who look forward
to a career in business and in-
dustry.

“The integrity of the pro»
grams of juniors now engag-
ed in fields of concentration
will be fully protected for the
coming year, so that no em-
barrassment will be experi-
enced ill completing tlle re-
quirements for graduation,"
President Stevens empha-
sized.

FOUR COURSE PLAN

Under the four course sys-
tem, which will go into effect
next September, every stu-
dent will take four courses a
semester, each course giving
credit for four hours of work.
Classes without laboratory
periods willmeet four times
a week.

”The new system will prevent
students from taking six or seven
courses, and never having the
chance to really prepare and study
any one of them,” Dr. Stevens
said. "Under the revised curri-
cuium, by the use of the four
course plan, we also hope to
clear up the problem of lost
marginal time. As things stand
now, time, before 2L floater in the
afternoon, as well as free periods
in the morning between classes,
is frequently wasted by the stu-
dents because it is difficult to
do anything useful in so short
a period. Under the new system,
the student might have a class
in the morning and another in
the afternoon, making it possible
for him to use creatively the
large areas of free time between
classes,” the president stated.

Laboratory periods will be held
in the morning and afternoons
under the revised curriculum.
