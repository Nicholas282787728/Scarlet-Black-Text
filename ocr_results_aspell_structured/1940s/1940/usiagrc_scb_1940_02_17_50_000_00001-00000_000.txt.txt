Ko/ln Asserls First World War Was Vital
Step Toward rWorld Democratization’

“The first World War did not
make Europe safe for democracy
as was intended, but it was a
step toward the democratization
of the world." said Dr. Hans
Kohn, professor of history at
smith college, in a lecture Wed-
nesday evening in Herrick chapel.

Dr. Kohn’s talk entitled, “The
First War and Its Outcome," was
the second of eight lectures of
the fourth annual history series
at GrinneLL

“The American dream of great-
er freedom, greater peace and se-
curity after the war swept the
world, and hy 1917-18 the allies
fought to establish a new world
order. .A great utopi n dream
possessed the people," Dr. Kohn
continued.

Throughout history, major wars
have sometimes helped to form
a new world order, and in Febru—
ary, 1917, news of the first Ru
sian revolution had pcnet ted si-
beria, and everyWhei-c in Russia
a new joy filled the hearts of eve
cry man living, the professors

 

“When the war ended, a great
disillusionment followed win all
men exhausted and unwi ing to
take the steps necessary to estab-
lish the new order. Nothing Iast~
ing comes suddenly," Dr. Kolin
said, "and this disillusionment,
although historically wrong. has
been characteristic ot post-war
periods.”

Dr. Kohn prophesied that the
first World War was the begin-
ning of an immense world revolu-
tion, and as the French revolu-
tion did not immediately show its
fruits, this war, in alike manner,
has paved the way for a world
democracy.

The second World War found
all the nations of the world un-
prepared to adjust themselves to
the necessary transition from
“rugged individualism” to a new
spirit of cooperation, Dr. Kohn
stated.

“No individual devil caused
this last war," he concluded, “but
all of us, for we are not prepared
to change our political thought in
the new direction."
