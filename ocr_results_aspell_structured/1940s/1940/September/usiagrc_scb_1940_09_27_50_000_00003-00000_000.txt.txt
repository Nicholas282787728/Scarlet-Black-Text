Drama Deparfmen'l'
Cancels Plans For
Homecoming Play

Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor, drama
director, announced this week
that the drama department will
not present a homecoming play,
as has been the custom in past
years. -

Reasons for this decision are
the inauguration of President
Samuel N, Stevens, the lack of
time necessary to produceaplay
and the fact that Cornelia Otis
Skinner, dramatic reader, will be
included on the homecoming pro—
gram.

The that play will be given
early in December, The depart-
ment is now considering plays,
and an announcement will he
madc in 10 days, Mrs. Pryor
stated.
