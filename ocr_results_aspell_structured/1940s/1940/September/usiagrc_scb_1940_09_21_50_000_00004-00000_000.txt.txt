ACH YEAR AT this time a ﬂood or football dopc crosses our desk,

and from the looks of this choice propaganda, the race for tile
Midwest coni‘crcncc football championship is going to be a wide open
one . . , . Knox and Ripon tied for the title last year. and Ripon
is \‘en a good chance to repeat, . . Btloit is also considered a
threat for the top position . As far as next week's game between
the pioneers and Lawrence, the consensus of the different. news
bureaus ravors the Scarlet and Black over the Vikings. . ,

o o o o o r
This is the third year for Coach Bernie Heselton of Lawrence , . .
In his other two years he finished at the top in 1938 and in the
cellar last year . . .

The 1940 Football Illustrated Annual has this to say about the Griir
nell team . . . "Tutored by the greatest athlete in the ninety—four
year history or the gray old GRINNELL, the Pioneers storm into
their second season in the Midwest Confeience with stern eyes on
a championship. Ben 0, Douglas. Scarlet and Black star of '28 to '30,
leaving his coaching job at Maplewood High in Missouri, is building
on a great guard, little Louie Gonias, and tall thin Ed Walters, split
second lialtback. Always short on reserves, the Pioneers will tough

it out."

o c a u o
In compiling the 1940 football schedule, William F. Boand has this
under meet-innell schedule . . , “At least one game stronger. The
new coach has stirred up a lot of spirit, There's a weak spot at
center that should stitt‘en in time, and the backs show a lot of sLuff."

AT RANDOM. The Green Wave at Tulane university has olive and
blue for colors A person would almost have to be colqr blind to see
green out of that color combination . , . According to the Football
Annual there are 35 newly appointed coaches taking the reins of col-

‘lege football this fall . i A team is now allowed only twenty-five
seconds to put the ball in play. This time Was formerly thirty Sets

system

spring will be picked from the
winners of this meet, a doubles
tournament to be scheduled soon,
and several round robin meets to
be held later this ‘fall, Feisner
