No Airport Here;
Prospect Lands
In {Montezuma

News from the admissions office
this week should please the mem—
bers of the Skyway club and par-
ticularly Robert Hall and Ray 0.
Gustafson, chief exponents of an
airport for Grinnell.

Saturday when Denise Fried-
man and her mother, Mrs. M. B.
Friedman. decided to fly here
from their home in Chicago in
order to look over Grinnell, they
were forced to land at the Moxie
tezuma airport. At Montezuma,
they were met by Ruthe Edwards
and Helen Potter, Grinnell coeds,
and Mr. George Hiser, president
of the Grinnell chamber of com-
merce.

The local Chamberof Commerce
makes it a policy to transport
anyone gratis, to and from Mon-
tezuma in the event they use air
service, according to Mr. Hiser.
No regular air service has a stop
in Montezuma, and it is necessary
to charter a private plane it you
travel by air to Grinnell. The
plane which brought the Fried-
nians was owned by Miss Frieda
man's uncle, and was the first
plane to use the Montezuma air—
port in three weeks.

The air visitors were in Grln~
nell three hours, arriving at Mon-
tezuma at noon and leaving at
about 3:30 p. m.

In the last two weeks 75 pro—
spective students and their pare
ents have visited the campus
from five states, according to the
admissions office, but the Fried-
man’s were the only visitors to
make use of the air lanes,

The Scarlet and Black presents
this reprint from the sports
column of George Hinshaw,
sports editor of the Marshall-
town Times~Republlcan in the
belief that it is of interest to
the Grinnell student body. This
is Mr. Hlnshaw‘s first visit to
the campus since the shift in
the athletic department.

A few former Grinnellians and
another handful of prospective
students at the college went to
Grinnell Saturday to see the high
school track meet and to make
the acquaintance of Ben Douglas
and Oliver Wagner, the new di-

Pioneer institution. They came
away much impressed with what
they saw and heard. An out-
standing factor is the enthusiasm
manifested about Douglas and
Wagner. From Les Duke, :tth—
letic director, on down to the low—
liest prep, they think the new
coaches are absolutely tops. They
like the new football system (new
to Grinnell) which is being his
stalled, they like the methods and
manners of the coaches and are as
sure as can be that within two
years Grinnell will be back among
the leaders of its own class in the
athletic world.

As an example, when :i sci-im-

mligo session was held Satur-
day morning, the grid squiul
started work about 9:45 and
when the coaches culled a halt
at 11:30, the boys begged for
another 15 minutes. They were
iioiilly enjoying the workout and
that is something new at Grin-
nell. Douglas and Wagner make
a perfect team. They have
worked together at Mopleivood,
Mot, for so long they dovetail
their efforts without a slip and
are getting results, Ben says,
like all good coaches, that mir-
