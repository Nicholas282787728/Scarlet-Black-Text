Banning of ‘Pardoner’ s Tale’ Creates Many Opinions
Among Newspaper Men From Newton to Chattanooga

By Ken Mall-laws,

The response of newspaper editors
in their editorial columns on the
recent banning by Pres, John 5.
Nollen of Margaret Curl-ier’s
play, “‘I‘he Pardoner's Tale," has
been widespread throughout the
Midwest. The majority of clip-
pings have tended to support
President Nollcn’s action, but each
member of the Fourth Estate
seems to get a different slant on
the affair.

An editorial appearing in the
Chattanooga Times e n t i t l c d
"Chaucer vs Grinnell,” upheld the
president but advanced one novel
idea in the last paragraph.

"Whether or not Miss Currier
gets her play produced, and
whether or not it is a good play.
are hardly important. What is
important is the fact that her lit-

MRS. NUCKOLLS HONORED
Mrs. R. F, Nuckolls, 'os, director
of Barton hall, on Iowa state
college dormitory, has recently
been elected to membership in

tle battle with the college may
stir some students to the point
of reading or rereading Chaucer's
work, one of the most dramatic
short stories in the Language,
And if it does, Miss Currier and
President Nollen will deserve the
thanks of the students affected."

A careful cheekrup with the li-
brarian shows that Crinnellians
have been slow to respond to the
situation by reading Chaucer,
Less than ten people have used
the copies of Chaucer’s “Canter-
bury Tales” on reserve in the li~
brary.

The Newton Daily News had
this to say about the incident in
an editorial entitled, “Rage
Should Pass Soon."

“But the debate does not call
to mind that an unusual range of
stories, plays and hooks in which

Ad Building Project
Rivals WPA; Timbers
Are Not Placed Right

Although lacking the red, white
and blue Works Projects Ads
ministration sign, timber en-
forcements now adorning the
south side of the Administra—
tion building look somewhat
like a federal project.

We feel it is our duty to
point out to the powers that
be, that a more efficient me-
thod of bracing the building
would be achieved by placing
the timbers against the wall
at a 45 degree angle.

We recall a visit to Helena,
Mont, several years ago short-
ly after an earthquake there
which substantiates our claim.
Most ot the buildings left
standing, at that time, were
braced with timbers in the
time—tested 45 degree angle
method, and not like those now
used on the Ad building.

 

 

swearing and drinking and moral
degeneration predominate, has
been going the rounds thesc days
as sarcalled Loprﬂight literature.
We be e in mind “Grapes of
Wrat “Native Son," “Christ in
Concrete" and numerous other
books of a similar nature . . ,

“Never has it seemed neceSr
sary to us for a lot of the vul-
garily that has been contained in
some of these books to get the
points across. Some of the stories
have since been reproduced in
movies. There, of course, the
swearing and so forth is removed,
.And they seem to carry quite a
punch as to theme and pur—
pose . . .

“And incidentally to one’s air
ditory and ocular senses, too, it
will be a relief when this literary
swearing rage passes.”
