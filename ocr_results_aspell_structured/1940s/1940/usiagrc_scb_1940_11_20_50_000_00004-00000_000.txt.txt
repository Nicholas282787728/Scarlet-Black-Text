Duke Requesis
Managers For
Win+er Sporls

All men students who arc inter-
ested in taking part in the main
agement of winter varsity sports
should report to G. Lester Duke,
director of intercollegiate ath-
letics, sometime before Saturday,

The system for manager during
the basketball season will be
somewhat different from the sys-
tem used during football, There
will still be three sophomore man—
agers, two junior managers and
one senior manager, but each of
these students will have charge
or assist in some varsity sport
that comes during the winter
months.

This sport will not necessarily
be basketball, for swimming and
track will also need managers.
Duke stated.

Coaches Plan
Track Meels

Teni‘ai’ive All-Iowa
Indoor and Ouldoor
Evenis Are Discussed

A meeting of four Iowa collcgc
track coaches was held here Sun-
day, according to G. Lester Duke,
director of intercollegiate ath-
letics. "The purpose was to talk
about the possibilities of arrang-
ing state college track meetsi
both indoor and outdoor," Duke
stated.

Thosc present included Barker
of Corneu, Dickinson of Iowa
state Teachers college. Easton of
Drake, and Duke,

“The group expressed itself as
favorable to the move that would
revive the all-Iowa college and
university track meets," said
Duke. “We think it would he a
tine thing for track," continued
Duke, “and it would help to cre-
ate more interest in high school
track."

Tentative plans now indicate
that the indoor meet will be held
late in March in either the Drake
or the University of Iowa field-
hOIISeS; While the outdoor events
will probably be held at Grinnell
or Iowa State college about the
middle ‘of May.
