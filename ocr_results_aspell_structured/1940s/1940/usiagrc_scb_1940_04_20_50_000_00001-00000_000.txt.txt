Dorm sExperts
Fear Weekend
G I am 0 u r L ost

Grinnell's cocd clothing problem
went into a slack season near
the end 01‘ the week despite a
Sunday style trend Thursday.
Maybe the coeds dress-up day
was a day to remember. but
many dormitory sexperts agreed
on one point. Such a procedure
was impractical in that the girls
would find it difficult to increase
the glamour sufficiently for the
week ends.

That the slack problem is not
unique at Grinnell was empha—
sized when the Friday Scarlet and
Black mail was opened. Includ-
ed was a form for a poll by the
American magazine. Question
number two on the poll is, "Do
you believe that college girls
should be permitted to wear such
informal costumes as shorts and
slacks on the campus?”

ZephyrEditors Proclaim April Issue;
Don’t Expect Release Before May

By Ken Mathews.
A promise that the fourth and
final issue of Zephyr will be left
with subscribers at the end of
the month, was placcd in our car
yesterday by John McCiine. asso—
ciate editor and editor-elect for
next year. On checking the ra-
mor with Carolyn Bludorn, editor
this year, we found her in agree-
ment and so feel reasonably safe
in announcing that the magazine
will be issued sometime in May.
Somehow we feel superior when
in Contact with one of the Zephyr
staff, Perhaps it is because the

' Scarlet and Black has an office—-

uptown and downtown—while the

poor humor magazine has access
only to the library steps and the
chapel at 9 a. m. five times a
week.

Pristine purity is to be the keys
note of the magazine this issue
according to a usually highly l'e'
liable source. In fact our Con»
fident went so far as to infer that
due to reccnt hints about a
drinking purge floating about the
campus, one story planned for the
magazine had to be drastically
changed so that it will be about
a bottle of milkiif it is used.

Results of Zephyrs campus poll
of men versus women will also
be included in the magazine.

 

O LET'S VOTE YES

 

At housemeetings next Monday night the new student council coh-
stitution will be presented to the student body for ratification.
Differing from the constitutional changes of the past few years,

this document is not a “revision.”

3. The powcrs and responsibilities of the council have at last
been defined. thereby removing the cause for the present confusion
concerning the proper status and functio’ns of that hody.

4. The purely administrative offices of Student ‘Auditor and
Director of varsities are to be appointive, salaried positions responsible

to the council.
5. Browsions instituting the

initiative, referendum and recall

guarantee an increased responsiveness of the council to the wishes

of the student body.

These are the major proposals of the new constitution, proposals
which are designed to abolish the present di satisfaction With campus
