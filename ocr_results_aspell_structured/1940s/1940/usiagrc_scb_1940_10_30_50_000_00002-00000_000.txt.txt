D Roosevelt or Willkie

Next Friday evening the final round of the
Merrill debates for this season will be held
in Her ick chapel.

Featured as a political rally, the debate
will be upon the question: Resolved: That
Wendell L. Willkie should be elected Presi-
dent of the United States on November 5,
1940. A two-man team representing the
Republican side and a two-man team for
tlle Democratic view, both of which have
suwived two preliminary rounds in which
representatives of all the men‘s halls par~
tic pared, will argue this propositionia
proposition of unsurpassed importance to
the United States of America.

Obviously, the question is not abstract.
Neither is it one inviting the use of dull
technicalities in its argument. of both cur-

rent interest and historical significance, it
precludes these two curses of altogether too
many debates: abstractlless and technicalis
ties. instead, the discussion should be both
entertaining and informative.

At least, we trust that the latter char—
acterization will be more applicable than to
the other political debate held in Herrick
chapel this year. And we have little doubt
but what it will be. Hence, it is to be
hoped that enough interest in the national
campaign exists on the campus to duplicate
the attendance at the politicians’ debate.

The debate promises an interesting hour
in it elf. A responsive audience will go far
toward increasing its appeal.

0 Homecoming, 1940

It is with a most comfortable feeling that
the Scarlet and Blilcli casts a backward
glance over this last weekend. What sacrie
ficc Grinnell college placed upon the altar
of the gods of the wind and the rain, what
offering she made to the deity of chance,
what she gave to the spirit of good feeling
we don‘t know. But we do know that the
oldest college west of the Mississippi River
has just experienced the most successful
Homecoming in nearly a decade.

And, although the gods may hold part
credit for the success of the past few days,
there are others to whom it can be more
(lirectly traced

To those persons and organizations, the
Scarlet and Black, in this instance is certain
it speaks for the entire school, extends
heartiest congratulations. To Coach Doug-
las and the team, to the administration, to
the Honor “G,” to the alumni, to the de-
partment of music—to these and all others
who had a place, however small, in the 1940
Homecoming grateful thanks are both due
and forthcoming. Through the efforts of
these individuals and groups, Grinnell has
not only experienced a glorious Homecoming
but has witnessed a display of the will
and ability to accomplish big things in a
big way.

And that is what Grinnell needs.

(Editors Note: The following
letter to the editor is written
in reply to an editorial appear-
ing in [lie Scarlet and Black
Wednesday, oct. 19, entitled
"Student Leader Scribble. ' The
letter was signed by the sun
dent Council.)

Dear Willie:

Nearly fell over when I receive
ed your letter of October 19. From
the tone of this letter it appears
that you must have been sleep»
ing through the meetings of the
Student Council. 1 have found
that anything to be successful
must first have organization and
(hen cooperation from everyone
concerned. It doesn't seem pos—
sible to me that the Carnival
”just happened" or that Victory
day took care of itself. I don't
know what preparations are
necessary for such affairs, but be-
fore you spout off to me again,
find out the Whole story.

1: doesn’t seem that college is
cultivating u very longdivod mem-
ory for you. You don’t seem to
remember thus the uentrnlized
studcnc auditing sysicm is a, di-
rect result or last year's confer-
ence. At the iimc you thought
the Spring; Day was quite on oc—
casion. Wasn't llmt n suggestion
of the coufcrcnoc and wasn't it
plumml by the Student Council?
The White Housc wus conceived
and provided for at the first
Brooklyn conference.

By the way, the agocld prob-
lem of financing the Scarlet and
Black was also solved last fall.
The paper has always had to
invciglc someone into subsidizmg
it, Now that a sotisfaccion solu-
[ion has been found and the pubs
lication is on sound financial
basis you should be thankful that

To the Editor:
It )5 who dcsn'e of all those who
participated in the work of plan-
ning for the inauguration of
President Stevens, to express
grateful thanks to the many stu—
dents who assisted in one way
or another. As ushers. guides,
messengers and in other capacir
ties, they rendered a. service of
great value.

The eo-operative spirit display-
ed was very fine and is sincerely
appreciated. If provides new ovi-
deuce of the loyalty of Grinnell
students and of their willingness
to serve whenever called upon.

On behalf of my colleagues on
the faculty I desire to tender to
all of the students who helped
us, this simple but sincere OX-
prcssion of our thanks and grati-
fudc.

Axis) (Grand Plan’

—ny William 0. m.

With Mussolirws smash into
Greece the longawaitcd unfolding
of the Axis’ grand plan of at
tack has begun. Whether the
"grand plan” has been hrewmg in
the masterful brains of the two
pal‘idlersAinrdeath for a consider-
able period or whether it is an-
other invention mothered by neces-
sity is not yet clear, but there
can be no denying that ii. is
now being put into execution.

There are those who are cons
«vinccd that the extension of the
lighcing into the Grcooion hills
is n cover-up more on the part
of i-hc ani lcudcr, laboring in
frantic. attempt to divert the ot-
tentiml of his war-weary follow—
ers from the nusu ssfnl attack
upon England. ml in a ccrloiu

Instead, it would seem that the
lurc of Mesopatalmal‘l oil bulks
ldrgc m Hitler‘s eyes, with the
possibility of controlling the Suez
running a close second. It is a
matter of common knowledge that
Germany’s grcatesc need is oil.
Shc docs not produce it herself.
She can not import enough from
Russia and Rumania to sousfy
her my needs. And after eleven
months of blltzkllcgs, it is logical
to suppose her reserves have

dwindled alarmingly.

n: i interesting to note that
(he first item on the Browns
shirts’ agenda. upon their occu-
pstion of numonm was the seize
uxe of all operating oil wells,
closely followed by the expulsion
of all representatives of British
oil firms. Grim precautions were
mken that the confiscation should
prooedc quietly and quickly in
order that no sabotage attempts
would be possible by agents of
His Majesty’s government. Such
profound concern about the flow-
ing block liquid can only indicate
its paralnount value to the Ger-
man high command.

Similarly, the control of Suez
is another prize worth a major
effort. For with the British line
of communication with India
and Austraha clipped in the cenr
ter, the operating difficulties of
the Royal Navy would be multir
plied a hundredfold. The whole
of north Africa and the Near
Easc would form the shores of
an Axis lake, giving the Fascist
powers access to a great new
market and vast quantities of raw
materials so necessary to the con-
duct of modern war. For, without
Suez and her near—eastern bases,
the British fleet would have lime
hope of dominating the Mediter-
ranean.

With the loss of this command-
ing position she would lose her
ms to these raw materials,
particularly oil, and her ability to
halt German and Italian economic
expansion in the Africun and near-
eastern arcs. Moreover, the diffi-
culties of mall-mining connections
with her far-eastern possessions
would be augmented. Not only
would the distance be increased,
but the danger on the route
around Africa—already being used
to certain extent for safety’s
sake—would jump fen-fold with
the Red Sea ureu turned into a.
base for Nuzi naval operations.

It is also extremely probable
that the Axis powers will short-
ly move to Gibralteripel'haps
even before this goes to press—
in an effort to gain control of
the western Mediterranean as
well. And it is quite probable
that such an action may prove
successful for the gooscsccpping
powers. But he as that as it may,
the more important scene of
battle is the Near-East. For up-
on the outcome there may well
depend the final decision of the
war. If Herr Hitler can divert
England's Mesopatzmian oil flow
to his own tanks and seriously
menace the “life line of empire,"
John Bull’s Victory stock is gn-
mg ro hit a new low.
