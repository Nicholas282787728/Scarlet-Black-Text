Claims U5. Should
Avoid War
With japan

By William 0. Hands,

Major foreign policy headache of
the administration at the present
time is the far eastern situar
tion. with the recent tripartite
confirming- long-standing official
jitters concerning Japanese am-
bitions in Judo-Asia and further
stretching already strained rela-
tions between this country and the
Land of the Rising Sun, the dis-
turbing question pops to the fore;
What should the United states
do in the Pacific?

To a certain extent, a firm at
titude may be wise, But at the
same time it would he stark folly
for our government to refuse to
attempt on understanding with
the Son of Heavens subjects.

Of course, it has often been
said that the United states must
he wining and able to protect her
sources of vital raw matciials in
the Malay states and the Dutch
East Indies. That has been prob-
ably the main argument of those
who advocate prompt and fol-ce-
fui action against Japan. And it
is true that America obtains cer-
tain of her strategic materials
from that region, the biggest item
being about 93 per oent of the

render this half of the world self—
snfficient with the judicious use
of substitutes and reasonable con—
scruation.

Bolivian tin, for exampie, would
be adequate to furnish onerthird
of normal United states con-
sumption, provided smeltcrs are
established in this country. This
one»thll‘d of peacetime needs
would be sufficient for defense
purposes, and substitutes are
available for its other uses, Likev
wise, rubber production of Latin
America is being developed. And
Standard Oil, Du Font and Good-
year have all announced sub-
stitutes which meet standard re-
quirements. Thus, it is difficult
to see that the United states is
completely dependent upon {are
eastern sources for strategic raw
materiaisicertainly not enough to
justify an expensive war.

And another thing: In the event
a German victory in Europe re—
sults in Nazi control of the
British fleet—a not at all remote
possibilityqt will belioove the

l d States lo lie in a strong
iiiing position in the At
luntic. Tlint it enn not be with
a hostile Jﬂpiul necessitating the
presence of the major port of our
ﬂeet in the Pncilic,
chce, whatever our emotions
may be, no matter how great our
love for the British Empire and
the struggling Chinese. it would
seem that plain common sense and
the best interests of the United
States indicate that this country
should strive to reach a peaceful
understanding with Japan, Only in
this manner will we be able to
avoid a war which is not only un-
but which could well
prove disastrous to the command—
this
holds in world affairs.
