rier affair.

Already there have been two editorial
comments prepared upon this situation, and,
in each case, new facts have come to light,
throwing severe doubt upon the truth of

certain statements in these comments
Hence, further investigation has become
obligatory.

Even as we go to press, the latter of
these editorials is receiving consideration
before the Publications Board,

It is unfortunate that so long 21 delay has
become necessary, but in the interest of
truth, we can take no otller course. One
thing, however, can be promised: that the
truth will come out, even if it takes us all
year to uncover it.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
{By Associated Collegiate Press)

“College cannot talk about democracy and
at the same time refuse to allow democratic
principles and methods to be used on their
own campuses Boards of trustees, faculties
as well as student bodies, must see demo-
cracy as a way of life effective here and
everywhere.” Dr, Gould Wickey, Council
of Church boards of education secretary, de—
mands that students and faculty members
practice what they preach.

G

“Tile question is more symbolic of the
modern mood. We are here as inquirers;
we try to find answers to many problems,
great and small; and there is hardly a more
inspiring enterprise than this. Cultivate
also that which is represented by the ex-
clamation point, namely, your capacity to
wonder and admire." Pres. C, M. McClelland
of Mchurray college for women punctuates
his comments with apt smiles.

 

Students Criticize, Upheld Republican Club

To The Editor:

I sadly notice that editorially
you have said nothing about the
new politically partisan group
which is attempting to mushroom
on the campus under the direc—
tion of a gift-uf-gab sophomore
and some of his little friends.

If this partisan organization
were an elfect of spontaneous in-
itiative, I would have less to say
of it; but since it buds like a
pussy willow as the direct results
of the efforts of an outside or—
ganizer, I believe the more liber-
al students of Grinneu have much
reason for concern.

In the first place, I cannot but
believe that a college is a place
where supposedly open»minded
young people may acquire the
facts, ideas, ideals, and tech.
niques whereby they may form
meir own opinions.

At college, students usually
have the first, and too often the
only opportunity for exercising
their mental equipment in chaos
ing the principles and pluloaophias
by which they will liv. let live,
and help to live. Grinnell, I be-
lieve, in the past, present, and in
the future, has and will give the
students just such an Upportnl
ty.

But—when a partisan organi-
zation can propagandize students
into its ranks, without editorial
comment from the only school are
ganithen such an opportunity is
in danger.

National partisan politics seem
superficially necessaryioff the
campus. When the campus is in-
vaded, however, as it probably
will be, something needs to be
said. Let any kind of organiza-
tion start up: yes, but by all
means give it a public airing in
more than the news section.

The organization under discus-
sion, on embryonic chapter of the
Young Coucge Republicans, is at-
'empting to enroll students into
its ranks as would any tempt»
rary election-year pressure group.
students are being asked to
blindly throw their influence to a
party which has not yet drawn
up its platform, and which may

 

To The Editor:

P. T. Barnum once Said, “Any
kind of publicity is good publici.
ty.” I am inclined to agree with
this great general of public Dplnr
ion, and so in my first reaction
to Mr. McIntosh’s letter, as chair-
man of the Grinnell Chapter of
the College Republicans 0f Amerr
lca. is to extend my sincere
thanks to Mr. McIntosh for his
enlightening method of bringing
our club into the public eye, even
though it was done with a ”sad-
dened” attitude.

To continue, I have allmys be-
lieved that tho greatest bane of
Grinnell college criticism is the
misinformation, Let me say here,
then, that n no longer potcntinl
Phi-Bete has rather opened the
door for an attack because of his
“sadly" misinformed criticism.

In the first place, the Griunell
Republican club has not mush.
warned on our campus. Rather,
it has gradually built itself into
an “oak" of unity and cooperation
under the direction of a sopho-
more sincerely interested in pole
itics as a vacation with the as-
sistance of some friends, to me,
much “bigger" than our opposi—
tion.

Can anyone, genuinely con-
cerned with a project of worth
01' any kind or nature, say that
an outside organimr is the uir
denying cause of the worthless-
ness of that organization. We
follow, not as sheep, but us inter
ested young college Americans
attempting to learn more than a

very possibly include the planks
of political expediency seriously
against the national and interns
tional interest.

Let us hope that Gi-innell stu-
dents will pause and eflect. They
should still be suffi iently open-
minded to place loyalties for
conscientious reasons instead of
for politically partisan reasons.
.As enlightened students of the
best that civilization has to offer.
may they at least keep their eyes
open until party platforms have
been announced.

—Lce McIntosh,

blind acceptance of all that is of—
ferch to us in books and on the

campus proper. Thus, it is my
contention that we are open-
minded young people, acquiring,

not propaganda in the sense used
by Mr. McIntosh, but facts, ideas,
ideals, and techniques for which
we shall earnestly strive without
fear of petty criticism, Griuneu.
because of its broad viewpoint, of-
lers us, as students, the chance
to form our own opinions and
strive for them in our own man-
her.

The partisan organization re—
{erred to, the College Republicans
of America, is not propogand‘
ing students into membership,
but is enlisting them in a cause
which we, as members, believe
firmly is right, and to which we
have a. right as democraticAmer-
icans.

May I here straighten out Mr,
Mclntos. ‘s idea of our, not em-
bryonic, but full sizlxl chapter of
the c. R. A. We are not a tem-
porary election year group, but
are a. junior member of a un-
tionlll organ ntlon known as the
Young Republicans of America,
on efficient organization existing
not only in yours housing an elec-
lion.

We, as a group, are not voicing
our approval of an unborn pob i.
cal platform, but are attempting
to clarify the issues which the
several leading Republican candl—
detes offer to the public. We
agree with cal'tain fundamental
Republican doctrincs, advanced
by every Republican candidate
for the nomination for president.
As ler' as a platform arising
which is against the national and
international interest is con-
cerned, that little matter evolves
into personal opinion and political
prejudice, with which We, as in-
telligent Americans, are not the
slightest concerned.

We have our eyes and ears
open, and are ready and willing
to accept any sincere suggestions
as to ways and means of improv-
lug our group. We are conscien-
tious in our desires to support
those whom we believe to be

our whole organization when I in-
