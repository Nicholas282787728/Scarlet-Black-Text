DORIC

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

SPECIAL—They say it's a sign of
senihty when one begins to talk
about the good old days. But
senile or not, we feel it's time
to dwell a bit upon the super»
iority of a few of the good old
things.

You don’t pity much attention to
the editorials, we're afraid» But
you do pay attention to this
column. We know you do, because
you've been taking great pains to
tell us how crummy it’s been for
the past few months,

a . a

You may not feel it's the place
of Doric to editorialize. All we've
got to say is this: the greatest
Doric editor in history didn't hesi-
tate to devote a column or two
to what he nionght should be
said when it should be said. He
happened to be a bit before our
dine, out we see eye to eye with
him, nevertheless.

Here’s what's on our mind: we’re
sick of having this college clutter-
ed up with high school tricks
that wouldn’t do even an eighth
grader credit In other words,
to wit and viz.: we think (there’s
little if any excuse for the kind of
thing that went on at last night's
basketball game.
people who have such an excess
of nonchalance that they push
themselves into the public eye via
such childishness. 1f you don’t
know by this time to what we
are referring, you-re dumber than
the bunch of people who thought
it was “cute". We mean die
homey little domestic scene that
went on down on the davenport
at the west end of the gym. They
had the knitting, they had the
good books:‘ all they lacked was a
fireplace. There was a time when
such a thing could not have hap—
pened here, to coin a phrase. We
give the Honor “G” men credit
for doing the best they could
under the circumstances. It's not
their fault that the best didn’t
happen to be good enough.

Personally, we almost always be-
lieved that Grinncll girls lived up
to what the public relations de-
partment said they were. That is,
as far as not making spectacles
of themselves goes. We didn't
think that any of them would care
to make a fool of herself over
her knittin’. Neither did we think
that any knitting Grinnell wo-
man in slacks had enough glamour
to make a guy make such a com-
plete fool of himself twice in a
row eidier. But it all just goes
to snow that things are not
what they used to be.

a a e

And among other things that am
different are these: Once upon a
time a few people got a slight
glimmering of a thrill at hearing
”Sons of Old Grinnell” played at
the close of athletic contests. It
wouldn't make anybody too late
for his date if he’d stand still
for just a minute after the bes-
ketball game and sing it, even
now—that is, if the band would
play it, It also used to sound
pretty nice to come out of the
gym and hear me victory bell
singing out in the night. (Golly,
we’re getting poetic about the
thing.) But who thinks ot ring»
ing the victory hell now? And
another thing that used to look
kinda swell was the solid red
section of Honor “G” sweaters
decorating the bleachers, standing
up to welcome a man from the
floor or to applaud a good play;
l‘azzing the devil out of anyone
who tried to kick the no»datc
tradition in the teeth.
