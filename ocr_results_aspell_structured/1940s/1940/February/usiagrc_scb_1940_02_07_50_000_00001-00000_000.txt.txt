Student Opinion Survey fromiCoilege Campuses Reveals,
Increasing Minorii’y Favoririg a Third Term for Roosevelt

 

AUSTIN, Texas, February 6#
With pol cal winds already blows
ing in this election year of 1940.
Franklin D. Roosevelt finds hime
self with an ever increasing num—
ber of followers who would like
to see him run fol a third term,
But this group, among the rank
and file of voters as well as
among college students, is still
in the minority.

The Student Opinion surveys
of America sent its staff of in.
terviewers on campuses of all de-
scriptions everywhere in the
United states to ask a scientific
cross section of collegians,
“Would you like to see Roosevelt
run for a third term?"

The results. gathered and tabu-
lated at the University of Texas
for all the cooperating newspa-

 

per members of the organization,
show that the President has
picked up more than ten pct»
ccntage points on his third term
popularity during the last year
Comparisons of this type are
possible for the. first time now
that the Surveys has been operate
ing without interruption since De-
cember of 1933. Following is the
completc record on this subject
that has been kept by the SUP
veys:
A Tami) TERM
FOR F. D. in? Yes
December, 1938 27.2%
January. 1939 28.2
November, l939 31.3 ow
N0\V . . 39. 50.5
This series of studies reveals a
remarkably close resemblance to
the index kept by the Gallup poll

No

on the same topic.
general opinion has always out-
stripped student scntnncnt. 46
per cent of the voters now want-
ing a third term, the increases
have been in almost the same
proportions In January, 1939, 30
per cent of the U. s. voters ap-
proved, as compared with 23.2 of
the students

Although in this case it has
been shown that college students
follow the some trends of thought
their elders do, other comparisons
with American Institute of Public
Opinion polls illustrate the fact
that youth does not always agree
with older people. Also. events to
come here and abroad will have
much to do in changing attitudes
should the President decide to try
his luck again.
