A lINITY or PURPOSE

The problem of whether there are too many
clubs for vcmen on the Grinnell campus ill-
volves p marily the subject of whether,
through a diversification of activities, the

es of the various clubs are wasted
and the purpose of women’s organizations as
a whole is defeated.

A large number of clubs involving
membership by women may be defended on

League Board
Plans Changes

Suggests Elections
Be Held in First
Week of April

Two recommendations were made
recently by the League Board con-
cerning election of new members.

The first suggestion is that elec-
tions for new members he held the
first week of April, and the sec-
ond is that hath elections he held
in one week. The basis for these
recommendations is a conflict With
the early spring vacation and mid-
semester examinations.

The changes have been discuss-i
ed in cottage meetings and will
come before the quadrangle at
the next mass meeting, tentatively
set at March 4.

The League Board presidential
election, according to the consti—
tution of the Women's SelfnGov-
ernment association, takes place
not less than two nor more man
four weeks before the spring vaca—
tion. Nominations for the house
chairmen shall he made by ballot
one week following the election of
the president. If these recommen—
dations are adopted, both elections
will take place in one week and
will he held after spring vacation.

These changes are recommended
for this year only to see if the
method will be more suitable than book
the present plan. ,

the ground that such a condition gives the
women a chance to find a specific group in
which they have enough interest to devote
their time and energies.

However, the problem now appears to
be that the organizations are too inde-
pendent ill purpose. To many, it appears as
if the organizations go merrily on their
way, perhaps serving the smaller purpose of
their individual g oup effectively, but failing
to serve the purpose of the quadrangle pro-
gram as a whole.

At the present time, quadrangle leaders
are attempting to inject unity of purpose,
not through the elimination of groups, but
by establishing a kind of common aim for
the benefit of the cxtrwcur cular activities
of all the women. ,

One suggested means for obtaining this
end i that there be an occ sional joint
meeting of all organization officers to dis»
cuss their plans, and to find out how they
can integrate their work for the benefit of
the quadrangle.

The results of this program may not be

RETURN THE COURTESY

Friday morning, Grillllell college students will
have the opportunity to demonstrate the
success of non—compulsory chapel attendance.
At that time, Woodrow Ohlsell, Lawrence
college student, will welcome Gl-inllell into
the Midwest conference on behalf of his
School. More than that, he will take back
with him an impression of how things are
dolle at Grinnell, and especially the character
of the student body

Lawrence, we understand, has compul-
sory chapel attendance, and thus when we
sent a representative there last month he
had the attention of the entire student
body.

Need we say that in order to adequately
return the courtesy accorded a Grinnell man
at Lawrence, we, in turn, should turn out
equally as well at chapel Friday morlllng to
hear their representative?

New Republican

Program Favors
Sound Currency

#By William 0. Harris

Last Monday, the Republican
party’s I. Q. boys broke into
frontrpage print with the presen-
tation of a IMO-edition program
chlgned to save the country from
another onslaught of tho Democ-
ratic plague.

Foremost in importance and
sanity among these proposals
is the recommendation that the
president‘s nine-spread mono-
tary powers should be repealed
and a gold stmnlilrtl established
in a manner determined by a
commission of ﬁnancial experts.

The fact that the tremendous
power that Roosevelt holds over
the currency structure of the na-
tion is little realized by the avcr-
age citizen renders it all the more
dangerous. According to the
Thomas amendments to the AAA,
passed in 1933, the chief magis-
trnte now holds the power to in-
flatc our currency by $13,200,000,-
ooo without recourse to Congress
or the public.

From Roosevelt's partial exer.
cisc of the power. to devalue the
gold dollar by as much as 50
per cent, the treasury hits al-
really realized $2,809,000,000
when the dollar was dcvulued
by 41 per cent in 1934i Of that
sum, about $2,100,000.000 re-
mains in the Exchange Equals
izdtion fund, idle since the out-
break of the European war, and
which could now be placed in
circulation through using it to
retire government bonds, thus
leaving the way open to new
borrowings.

Moreover, a, full exercise of the
devaluation on power could in—
crease the dollar-value of our gold
holdings from $17,800,000,0DD to
21 billion. A cool $200,000,000
ripe for picking.

Likem'se, this power enables
the executive to boost the price
of the governments silver re-
serves to $2.55 an ounce, thus
permitting the issue of s4,900,~
000,000 in additional silver certi-
ficates, And ﬁnally, the presi-
(leut has the power under these
amendments to issue three bil-
lion dollars in “greenbacks” oi-
iinbnckcd United states notes.

Again the total: $13,200,000,ooo.
But these powers do not offer the
only danger of inflation.

Al: present our combined cur—
rency circulation hovers near the
sci-en billion dollar mark, How-
ever, at its present valuation,
our gold stock iilouc would sup-
port a currency circulation of
44 billion dollars iiitli n 40 per
cent gold backing and theoreti-
cally still remain sound. At the
full authorized valuation, our
present stock of the yellow met-
al would support 52 billion dol-
lars of the folding stuff.

To loose-money advocates these
facts present no great basis for
alarm, but to lhose who are still
old»iasllionetl enough to believe in
a sound currency, a drastic tight-
ening has seemed long overdue. It
is doubtful that the Republicans
favor a return of the old gold-
coin standard, but it is obvious
that that party, as the representa-
tive of sound business principles, is
plumping for a more sensible fin»
ancial setup. And as such, they
deserve the commendation and
support of intelligent citizens. It
Will be to America's advantage to
give them just that.

sity to establish a. school of fine
arts.
