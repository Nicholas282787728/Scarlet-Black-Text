Glenn Miller Tops

ltecord Data: One of those phas‘
nominal rises in the history of
popular music makers started in
the late . s when Glenn Miller
left the trombone section of a
band to organize an orchestra
of his own, founded on his own
unique arranging stylc. Almost
overnight the bespectacled trams
booist became one at Americas
first line dance band leaders. He
was voted the favorite band of
college music columnists across
the country, an achievement of
top importance since it is rec-
ognized that the college crowd
establishes the national yardstick
in popular music tastes. When
Glenn furloiighed from the band
two years ago to join Uncle
Sam‘s Army, his band was way
up on top.

In a salute to Captain Glenn
Miller, Victor has released an
album of the discs that did so
much to boost him [0 the front
ranks. Six swmg hits, “Amer-
ican Fstrol,” “Little Brown Jug,”
“In the Mood," “Song- of the
Volga Boatmen," “Tuxedo JnnCs
tion” and “Pennsylvania SixeFive
Thousand" share honors with
“Star Dust" and “Moonlight Sci-e
enade" to make up the set, The
discs’ are all plenty good.

Along with the Miller album
comes a new Victor coupling,
featuring Ray Eberle‘s voice withi
the band. “Basket. Weaver,” a
waltz, and “On a Little Street‘
in Singapore" are baclt to back
on the disc.

One of the cuter novelty tunes
to come from Tin Pan Alley joins
hands with a current hit ballad
on the latest Bluebird record by
the Four King sisters. The llov»
elty is “Milkman, Keep Thosc
Bottles Quiet,” a subtle reminder
to the four a. m. men with the
“bottled moon," and the ballad
"San Fernando Valley.”
Again it is the clever rhythmns
and the easy swing of the coun-
Lry’s foremost singing group
which will make this Bluebird fly
to the top of the disc parade.
On both sides the girls have
added words and tempo varia—

added charm “Milkmml, Keepf
Those Bottles Quiet" actuallyl
uses the sound eifect ot clinking"
bottles to give the disc an au-
thcntic ﬂavor. The authenticity
of the “San Fernando Valley"
side comes from the [act that the
valley is where the gll‘ls inahe1
their home in real life. .
