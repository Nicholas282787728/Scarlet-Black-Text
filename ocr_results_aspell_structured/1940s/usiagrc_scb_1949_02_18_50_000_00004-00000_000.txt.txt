pressed during the last five min—

long shots and whittled the lead[

margin to a scant three points.

The prime factor in Gtinnell’s
win lay in their ability to hit
the basket accurately. The Scars
let and Black wtook 68 shots and
sank 24 of them for a 35%
average, whereas the visitors
averaged 28%. Accuracy on the
free throw line was a different
story, as the Augies hit 17 for

20—35 compared to a 12 out of;

2» record for the Pioneers.

The Grinnell scoring ace was
Dave Dunlop, who, shooting
from many angles. bucketed 9
of his 21 attempts for a 43%
average. The big center, with
ma help of Earl Peisner, who hit
28% of his shots for lu points,
scored with regularity and led
the Pioneers to a 33-25 advan-

tage at halfrtlme. Blgelow and]
Kessel teamed up in the second‘

half to give the home team a l2
point lead with only three min.
utes remaining.

At this point Augustana's Ann
derson started to make his long
shots count, and with a minute
of play remaining, Coach Piitsch
sent in his starting lineup in an
attempt to squelch the Augies’
rally. The Pioneers were then
able to control the ball and
thwart the Augustana team, and
the game ended 5855.
