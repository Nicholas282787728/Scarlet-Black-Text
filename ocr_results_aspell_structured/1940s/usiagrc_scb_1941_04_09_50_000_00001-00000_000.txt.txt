Good Liberal Arts

Forty-four Griunell students chose
Chicago as the city in which to
conduct their annual job survey,
according to John c. Fctzcr, die
rector of the Chicago expedition.
Approximately 200 interviews
were secured with about 75
business firms.

In addition to the regular ap-
pointments three special excur-
sions were arranged. Part of the
group visited the SwiIt Packing
company, while somcwcnt through
the plant of the Chicago Tribune.
A group also attended the WGN
broadcast, "Citizens of Tomor-
row."

Insurance companies.
firms, ’ publishing houses, and
mercantile establishments were
among businesses surveyed by the
students.

Employers and other persons in-
terviewed proved to be interested
in the job survey and seemed
eager to provide information con
cerning the positions available in
their firms and the qualifications
for these positions.

Stcnographie training, or at
least the ability to type well, was
pointed out by almost all per-
sonnel directors to be essential
for women who wished to secure
positions in their particular or-
ganizations. It was observed, how-
ever, that a general college edu»
cation is a good stimulus for ad—

vancement and therefore, college
graduates are better fitted to rise
to the higher positions than grad-
uates of business schools.

A liberal college education is
the most important qualification
needed by the men, according to
most employers interviewed. Poise,
self-assurance, and confidence
were other qualities named. Col-
lege men are more likely to tul-
fil these specifications than those
who have not obtained academic
education, they asserted.

quarters for the Chicago survey.

Saturday Dance

ls Cancelled By
Fund Shortage

with the social committee al»
ready sanctioning the cancel-
lation of Saturday’s dance,
Gl‘illncll’s Varsity club is in
severe danger of passing out
of existence, according to a
report made to the Student
Council last night by James
Miles, Director of Val-sities.

Miles‘ figures show that
the club has a balance of
$9.34 with which to stage two
Varsity dances before the end
of the school year

According to the report Miles
made last night, the financial dol-
druins of the club can be directly
laid to lack of student participa»
tion. Seventy-four men and 70
women have bought Varsity Lick-
ets this semester. First semester.

chased tickets.

to $1,096.52. Second semester
figures to date show income to
be $333.51 and expenditures to

gestions to cope with the situaa

Eleanor Ain'l'
Coming Here

Poor Air Connections
Force First Lady to
Cancel Engagement

According to Max Burke, execu-
tive secretary of the Grinnell In—
stitute of International Relations,
Mrs, Eleanor Roosevelt has been
forced to cancel her engagement
to speak here June 16. She has
found that she Will be able to
spend only one day in the Middle
West, Burke said.

Des Moines to Chicago plane
schedules showed that Mrs. Roos-
cvclt would not be able to return
to Washington. The only possible
way of getting her here would be
by private plane, and the cost of
such a move makes this plan im-
possible, Burke said.

At present, the Institute is
seeking some other prominent
person to substitute for Mrs.
Roosevelt. There are two pOSSh
bilities for filling this vacancy,
but Burke will only say that they
would both be good drawing
cards. One is a national political
figure and the other a well
known journalist.
