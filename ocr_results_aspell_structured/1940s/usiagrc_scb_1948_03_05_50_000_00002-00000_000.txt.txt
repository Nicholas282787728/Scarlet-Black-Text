On Being Responsible

The planks are laid, the campaign pose
ters and literature distributed, and the
issues drawn, Excitement alld interest will

perhaps not quite so i ery as some former
election w eks, yet fiery indeed whell con—
trasted \\ th the hardlwdiscernable and
somewhat meager flame of interest in stu-
dent government which has flickered
throughout the past year.

Those hardy candidates who remain. in
the race now busy themselves in making

‘ pledges and promises, assuring us that
theirs is the best of all possible platforms,
and that their election will prove to be the
longrsought-aftei‘ and muchrneeded shot in
the arm of student government.

Let us liope that, whoever the suc-
cessful candidate may be, he or she will
not fail to realize and to carry out the
full responsibilities of office. Let us
hope that there is substance behind his
election platitudes and that he has the
character and ability to translate that
substance into action. Let us hope
that he can show as much enthusiasm
to accept responsibility next September
or January as he shows now in March.

Just what are the responsibilities of
the Student Council president? First of all.
he has accepted the office conferred on
him by popular ballot. He has responsiblh
ity to himself to discharge his duties 01
office with meticulous care, to endeavor to
Carry out the platform on which he was
elected, and to maintain a continuous high
standard of performance to the best of his
ability.

He has also responsibility to the ad
ministration and to the faculty. They have
accepted him as the chief representative of

the student body, in their relations with the
student body, He is a vital link, and upon

his performance depends largely the degreel
to which the “powers that be" will coopelui
ate with the student government i
Finally, and most important, he ‘
has a heavy responsibility to the stile
dent body. It has made him its chief i
representative. He must speak and act
for it, and, as popular opinion changes, l
he must keep himself ever conscious of
the student will and reflect it in his
words and actions.

He is the focal point of our stil—
dent government’s contact with the ad-
ministration, with the faculty, with ‘
other schools, and with the outside l
world ill general. He must according- 1
1y conduct his office to the end of l
maintaining the channels of student i
government which he focuses as open
and as active as possible. l

Let ils remember, however, that ourl
student body also has a responsibility ’ ,
regard to the office. It is the students who
will it by ballot, itis the students whom thel
Student Council president represents, and,
ill the last analysis, it is only the students;

representative and not circumvent his
office. We have elected him; now let usi

Letters To
The Editor

Marcll 3, 1948
Grinncll, Iowa

Editor and student body,

At this Lillie we would
like in express ollr appreciation
for the sorcalled spirit which met

,us at every game, We feel that
‘both the football and basketball

teams deserved a great deal more
school spirit than was received.
Where is the spirit or Grillnell?
During the whole season we 5111'
ceiely fought to bring out a oi:
oi that lost spirit so that the
teams would have some school
backing However, we are sorry
to say that there is no spirit
here at Grinncil to bring out.

We. had two great teams, two
teams to fight for, and two teams
to support, but the only support-
ing and fighting was done by
the teams alone. The student body
Just sat back and griped.

We never asked for publiolty
or thanks. We only asked that
a fine school spirit be maintained
throughout the games,

Perhaps it is being too hopeful
to expect the season next year
to bring about a miracle, Per-
haps it is our fault for not arouSr
ing a deeper interest and spirit
toward ollr terms, if this is the
case, we wish to express our
sincerest apologies because
want the two teams to know
that we were behind them all of
the way. They were wonderful
teams of which Grinnell should
have» been very proud,

sincerely yours,

The recent Confusion
ling the eligibility of Student
,Coullcll election candidates, the
‘mixoip on the election board, and
the loopholes in election pro»
cedin-e: which led to added
apathy for an already fed-lip slur
dent body, indicate that some
tiling must he done

First, we must clarify Mei-y
rule to minimize the opportunity
for “special cases” arising. And
then, it seells to me, something
must be done in make the job
more attractive to as many good
candidates as pOSSIble it not, we
might as well be voting for the
top two as the top ten!

Memo to the building and
grounds department: Suggest you
get your was president in charge
of sidewalks-io-bedaidncxi-sum-
mer to note paths through the
snow for possible walk additions.
Also, we‘d like to endorse (and
see something happen about) the
Student Council proposal to elim-
inate the center drive on Mac-
Eachron field. Might even be able
to have a good game of intra—
mural football next fall it the
clnders go away,

Heard much comment follow-
ing the fresh dinner concerning
the possibility of starting a per»
manent set-up of coed dinners
Not date dinners. but merely two
or thiec nights a week when cer-
tail] halls can eat on the other
side of the campus. The plan
worked successfully (of neces-
Slty) in 1942-43; and it seems to
me it could be done now. It
might help what some call the
“strained social set-up" here.
What about it?

Many thanks to the VVAA,
Student Council and League
Board for a fine party last week-
