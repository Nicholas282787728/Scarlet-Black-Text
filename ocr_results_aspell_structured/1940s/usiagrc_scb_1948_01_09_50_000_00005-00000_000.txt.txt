' For the Pioneers it will be more!

consecutive season with the pre-,
Christmas loss at Monmouth, 60-

Heiny, Peisner Hold
Top Spots In League ‘
For Point Scoring ,

'Way down the list in loop,
standings, Grinnell’s Pioneer cag-
ers were 'way up the list in in-i
dividual performances as the Mid-‘
West conference race entered
backstretch with the turning ofi

the new year. 1

A conference record of one vice
tory against two defeats has
settled Grinnell in sixth place in‘
the nine-team conference, cur-
rently headed by a four-way tie‘
among Beloit. Monmouth, Curie-J
ton, and Ripon.

If the second division standing
is reminiscent of last season's fin—
al ratings, so are the individual
loop scoring records, with Earl
Peisner and .lim Heiny holding‘
down the No. 1 and 2 (tie) spots.-
Although Peisner's 14 points-per-
game average is topped by
Knox's Jim Pogiie with 18, Earl'
has collected 42 in three games

against the Knoxmsn's 36 for
two.

Heiny, meanwhile, also has an
aggregate 36, tying with Poguc
for second, with an average of 12
points per game. League—leading
Beloit, with three victories, is
represented by John Erickson in
the fourth spot with a total of
34 and an average of 11 and 1/3
per game,

Only Knox collegc with a one-
androne record stands between the
Pioneers and the four quintets
tied for first. Beloit. last season’s
conference co-champ is yet “he
beaten Beloit holding the edge in
the standings with three
victories to Monmouth's two. Eip~
on and Carleton have each won a
conference tilt without any losses
to qualify for the four way ti
Lawrence and Cornell meanwhile
are tied in the opposite direction.
Each has three losses against no
victories to tie for seventh Coe
had played no conference games
prior to the first of the year.
Grinoell defeated Cornell in the
conference opener, 50-36, here
last December. However, in the
first game away from home the
Pioneers were nipped 50-49 by
Monmouth, on the heels of which
came the poinlshappy 70-63 loss
to Eeloit just before Christmas.
