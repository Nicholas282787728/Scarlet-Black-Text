About 10 years ago, students of marine biology at the
University of Miami, Fla, were permitted to make occan
dives to study their subject First hand. Some 200 stu-
dents have since made more than 5000 descents to
depths of around 40 feet. Professor F. G. Walton Smith,
London biologist, conducts the class, as boys and girls
walk through a dramatic marineland m a brand new
world. Specimens gathered underwater are brought to
the surlace and carefully studied the lollowing day in
the laboratory. A recent session in the clear waters or
Rainbow Springs (and a submarine porthole) made pos-
sible these pictures.

Face to lace with marine lile, students are eager to Find book-learned specimens for classroom
studies. Water here is 74 degrees yeararound so explorers are not chilled during immersion.

weigh nothing under water; a push off the bottom brings the diver topside.

For real deep water diving this boat is used as a base {or operating. Partner grabs
the helmet's top as it breaks the water. Students often come up speechless with
excitement. .
