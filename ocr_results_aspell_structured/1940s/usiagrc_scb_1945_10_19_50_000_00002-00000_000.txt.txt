Trustees to the Rescue - -

Saturday will initiate a new era in the
college lives of the classes of ‘47, ’48 and
’49, THE FOOTBALL ERA. No one but
this year‘s seniors can remember when
Grinnell college had a real football team.
With the renewal of football and of men‘s
sports in general, there will obviously be
many changes in campus life. The athletic
department will become an increasingly im-
portant power. They will need more equip-
ment, more cooperation, and more money.
Equipment will come from athletic whole
sale housesl Cooperation will come from

the students. But where will the money
come from?

 

There is a plan in the making to finance
men’s sports with a fund from the student
activity ticket. Since the amount of the
ticket is not to be increased, this means
that certain organizations now receiving
money from the ticket must have their
financial support cut. The sem fee resolu-
tion states that, ”Tile members of the Stu—
dent Organizations Committee and ‘ the
Central Committee of the Student Council
recommend that the S&B is the organiza—
tion to be cllt if it is recommended that
some other organization receive more
money.”

The 821/: cent subscription rate per stu-

-dellt which the S&B now has for each see

mester will drop even lower. As a self-sup-
porting organization, the S&B cannot‘ af-
ford this change. Income from advertising
does not. as it is, make up the difference
between what it cost to produce it paper for
more than 500 students and what the paper
receives on a basis of only 500 students
‘Since the S&B has no other source of in-
come, it will not be able to meet expenses,
which may mean the discontinuation of the
publication.

It would be possible, however, for re-
gular subscription rates to be charged of
students individually. Each student would
have to pay $2.00 per year instead of the
$1l65 which he now pays as part of his
activity ticket. Then, too, the amount of
advertising could-be increased This would
give our paper an appearance similar to a
wellefilled shopping news. And who wants
to pay $2.00 for a shopping newsi7

There is a way out of this difficulty
which sacrifices neither athletics nor the
3&B, A trustees‘ fund exists which could
take care of student athletics much more
adequately than the activity ticket can.
This solution‘would provide the necessary
money for athletics without infringing
upon the finances of other campus enter-
prises. It would save the students money
in the long run and would eliminate a
possible source of campus friction.

Faith of Roland

Hayes Brought

To, Chapel Concerl Listeners

Roland Hayes, Negro tenor,
sings out of it deep cmwicnou
and inspiration, obvious to the
most casual listener. In an up
terview Monday, it became clear
that the dramatic inspiration in
his singing comes from a clear-
cut concept of a goal in life, u
real love [or and appreciallon of
the beauty of his art, and all
early love and guidance that has
always stoycd With him

His goal is to bring beauty to
the world, not only for temporary
enjoyment, but as part of it rich
life experience that will help his
listeners in making a better
world.

“We ale commg to a new so-
ciety . . . i may not live to soc

it, but some of those who hearl’

mc may be builders in it.“ he
said, “Today, we must carefully
find our way out of the debris of
what we have becn through
Then we must build again. [ii
I can give a little beauty to helpl
m ,the rebuilding, I Will have‘
accomplished something."

poser-s and the Negro spirituals
are alike things of touching
beauty to Roland Hayes. In in-
tel'prcllng them, he loses himself
in them . . and from ms ab»
solute absorption, as well as from
the mic quality of his voice,
comes the moving music hem-d in
the chapel Monday night.

In Lircolucsquo on, Mr,
Hayes credits much of his suc-
cess lo his mother. “Just be
fore she died," ho said, “She told
me that all her dcsn'es would go
on in me. Since her death, I
have felt o power within me that
drives me on.” This power help»
so him to overcome his gl‘lcf at
her death, andlto advance coh-
sinntly in his art.

Singing to a crowded
audience . at Monday’s
Mr. Hayes brought much or
own faith ouu sz-siuvity to
listeners He spol from
heart to “the under: of
