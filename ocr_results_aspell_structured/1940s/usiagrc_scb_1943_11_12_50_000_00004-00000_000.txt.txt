Engineers Victors Again 6-1

Engineers Tromp
Language Eleven
In Football Game

By A] Von Soclien

You saw a right good football
game on Sunday. In the return
match between the footballers of
the Engineeis and of the Langu-
age group, the Engineers again
came off victorious by a 6-0 score.

their first meeting on Oct. 3, the:
condition of the field was ex-

they were for superior to the
“outfits" uhich had been tieldcd

eventually it was a perfectly

spelled victory for the men from

During most of the play thc‘

that life is indestructable and un-

to remark that he hoped the war
wouldn't be over before he gets
his furlough in December.

highly recommend the idea to our
