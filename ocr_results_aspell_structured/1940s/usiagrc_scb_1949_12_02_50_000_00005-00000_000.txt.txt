Grapplers See

In spite of the Pioneers great
wrestling performance in the
spring of 1948, a year that saw
the Scarlet and Black finish
hard to cop second place in the
loop mat meet, the Grinnell
grapplers should be even strong—
er and more experienced this
season, An examination of the

Ralph Flanagan‘s new arch is
the sensation of the month and
is getting a big buildup on
Victor's Bluebird label.»WCody
Herman wil disband Dec. 6.
These apparently ‘unrelated
items seem to me indicative of
a rather ominous trend. 'l

Don’t misunderstand me, I
think Flanagan has a wonder-‘
iul band, one of the best in
years, but they play in a style
accepted and popular ten years,
ago. Herman, _on the other‘r
hand, was always experimenting
and trying new ideas. Granted,
they were not always good
ones, but to progress, one must
experiment with all ideas to dis-
cover which ones are worth
while. Music, like any other art‘
form, must be constantly ex-
perimenting, changing, and pro-l
gl'essing or it will become stage
nant and die. .

One of Ralph Flanagan’s newA‘
est is “Don’t Cry Joe,” backed
by “Sking to 45,” a lively jump.
number. Both are pleasant
listening and done in the best
Glenn Miller style.

"Why Was I Born," an old
KernrHammerstien tune, is
getting a wellrderserved revival.
Both Vic Damone and Bill
Lawrence have waxed it, with
Damone's coming out ahead ev-
en though he seems to strain a
bit for the high notes.

Another fastvclimbing song is
a mornful thing called. “I Can
Dream, Can’t I?" Yau’ll hear it
most often by the Andrews
Sisters' with Patti in the lead.

You'll also be hearing about
”Foolish Tears." cut by Al
Morgan and Ella Fitzgearld. It’s
a twin sister to "Jealous Heart,"
