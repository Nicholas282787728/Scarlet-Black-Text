kcr, who had called her for the
date. By now we have one can-
fused school teacher, who is still
more muddled and mixed up
when the real Hurry shows up on
the scene a minute later, Says the
real Harry, "Well, thanks, fellows,
for bringing my date to me." No
douht the gal got quite an im-

pression of the Crinnell men.

 

GUEST COLUMN: The following
hit of copy is composed chiefly
of notes taken during several visits
to the campus since our 146 se-

down the aisles of the dining
room during conference, “Gosh, I

Ferg, one of the most conscien-
tious objectors to the talk, final-
ly blurted out with a "yeah,
Yeah, I'se sees it."

BACK PATTING: The Si 5; B.
claims to be the first college
newspaper to back Wendell Will-
