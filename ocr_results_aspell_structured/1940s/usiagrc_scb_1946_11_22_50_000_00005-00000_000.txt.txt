Pioneers Lose To Colorado;

Gridders Oui'w

Gl'innell's Pioneers ventured in-
to the cold Climate of Colorado
last Saturday, played their last
football game of the 1946 season.
and returned, defeated 14 to 0,
but with the knowledge that they
had displayed fine sportsmanship
and had given the heavier Colo-l
rado college eleven a good battlel

The Bengals of c. C. opened‘

drive, led by Halfback Johnny
Ziegler and Fullback John Steele,

lor the initial tally of the game.
At this point the Pioneers made
their first bid for a score, when
Walt Burns blocked a Bengal
punt and fell on the boil on the
c. c. 14. Grinnell’s offensive bog-
ged down. and four plays later,
tlie Coloradoans ‘took over on
the own 13, halting the Pio—
p .rs attempt for a touchdown.

In the second quarter, featured
by Herb White's long kicks, the
Grinnell boys marched to the
Etngal's 37 yard line. but Webb's
passes failed to register, and the
Pioneers again lost the pigskin to
the Colorado outfit.

The third period saw the Ben»
gals again reach the Grinnell
goal, convert for the extra point,
and lead the visitors by 14 points.
The Grinnell aerial offensive fail—
ed in this period, and the game
changed into a defensive contest.
The Pioneer's last chance for a
touchdown came in the final‘
nuarter. Webb passed to Walt
Burns, who made a spectacular

 

lgrabbed a pass and journeyed to

eighed In Final

60 yard run to the c. C. 11. A
completed pass to Webb put the
ball on the one yard marker, but
a fumble by Steinbeck threw the
Pioneer eleven for a 19 yard loss.
The next play Phil southworth

the C. C. 2 yard line, but the
officials ruled him an ineligible
receiver, and 'the Grinnell offen<

sive attack came to a halt. The.
gun sounded, ending the game,
and Grinnell's Pioneers emerged
on the short end of a 14 to 0
score.
