Comment

Reprinted below is a pamphlet circu-
lated by Bloomfield College of New Jersey,
which we feel should make a fourth in our
“No Comment" and “Comment" series,
This series, as you will recall, has dealt
with thought control in its various shapes
and forms, froln “Loyalty tests" for high
'school instructors, as advocated by the
American Legion, lo banning mac" 'ies
such as THE NATION froln New York
schools, alid of urse including collgres»
sional committee investigations which have
been more sensational than beneficial.

Our point here is not a defense of
“Reds, pinks, and fellow travelers,” biit a
protest against the machinery, set up in
fear of Cummunisni, which is a serious
menace to the freedoms on which this coun-
try was founded. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

IS IT ACADEMIC LIBERTY . . .

0R ACADEMIC LICENSE

Because the problem of Americanisnl
Versus Communism today stands forth as
one of the world’s most critical issues in hu-
man relations, we feel that every intelli
gent citizen will be interested in the e.
change of correspondence represented by
the text on the following pages. The answer-
ing letter is published with the full consent
of the writer.

This exchange in points of view, we
believe, is one which offers a useful con,
trast on the question:

Have American colleges the right to
demand that their faculty members he
earnestly and actively pro—American, eager
to help indoctrinate their students in Ameri-
can ideals?

The first exhibit, following, is an ex-
cerpt from a circular bulletin sent by
Bloomfield College to other colleges and
universities as an effort to recruit specific
teacher personnel for the coming semester,
The second exhibit, reprinted in ful is a
reply from an administrative offi ial of
Harvard University.

We of the Bloomfield College adminis-
trative staff and faculty commend your at»
tention to both points of View represented;
one, that faculty members need not be per
sonally loyal to American ideals; the other,
:hat such loyalty is more than ever vital
in these times of critical conﬂict between
Americanism and un-Americanism.

Bloomfield College feels that “academic

 

It is used to provide a platform from which
to dispense a doctrine which in itself has
no place for . . . academic liberty.

We intend no rebuke to the Harvard
administrator, who is personally a fille
American. But we do strongly urge that
time and bitter experience have pointed to
the fallacy ill his reasoning.

Bulletin from Bloomfield College
QUALIFICATIONS ‘
(among others) . . ,
Definite, positive loyalty to Ameri-
c n politit l ideals and traditions, Reds,
pinks, near-pinks and “fellow travelers”
will not fit into the policy of Bloomfield
which, while aggressively committed to
’ sni and correction of the abuses and
inequalities of our present economic order
is fundamentally committed to the Aineri-l
can system as against communism or socialr
ism.

President Frederick Schweitzer

Bloomfield, New Jersey
Dear President Schweitzer:

I don’t believe that we have any recent
Pll. D.’s who would be candidates for your
position.

I should like to express my astonish-
ment on reading your qualification (2). Iti
has long been a canon of academic freedorn’,
that a man’s political opinions had no bear-1‘
ing on his ability to obtain and hold all aca-
demic appointment. I think it is even nlore
basically a principal of oilr American demo-
cracy that every citizen should enjoy free-i
dom of speech and freedom of thought. I
find it very difficult to undertand how
you can be engaged in an aggressive came
paig‘n to reorganize and strengthen Bloomv
field College when you so blatantly propose
to violate the principles on which both our
democracy and our educational system are
founded.

I realize that you are doubtless aware
of the issue which I have raised. I have
no hope that my protest will serve to sub—
stantially alter the basis on which your
judgments will be made. I do feel, how-
ever, that your letter should not go unchal-
lenged. I think that I speak for a consid-
erable portion of the academic community
in this matter.

Sincerely yours,
EDWIN B. NEWMAN,
Secretary to the Department
