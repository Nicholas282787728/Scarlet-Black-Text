1 The Scarlet and Black welcomes this
. \Lioltunity to make an official statement
.< ' the editorial policy to be pursued during
11’164’7. We believe that a student news~
192' should reflect student interests and
l is, as well as the current social activities.
It should present to the students as many
the l'acts behind as many of tile events
icll Lillie place on our campus as is
lll‘ntlllly possible. A campus newspaper
lfsllould worlt for enlightenment and coopera—
’ l. l'or advancement and all»college satis-
hon,
All editorial board, composed of repre-
tath 3 of student government and cam-
lcailel,, will meet weekly to discuss
«pus i ies. We will be able, in this
.\', l0 brlng together the ideas and re»
“lions of all tlle dill'ercllt groups which
.zr‘ul'ally form in a close society such as
one in which ‘ we are living. This
rightful Consideration will make for a
re thorough understanding 01' campus

unbiz cd, reported of the news, and will
it. me all equal voice to all campus groups.

As ior our editorial columns. we will
support the attitude toward each Colltl'0v
\'0 'al issue which we feel will have the
most long-range benefits for the students
and the college as a whole. but we will
, \‘c to present the facts and arguments
tor eacll side of the question.

Our purpose is not to influence the
student body. nor prejudice the student
body, but to inform it. We will publish
in ‘gned letters to the editor, and to the
host 01’ our allill y represent fairly both
student and administration views

TO END {’1' ALL . . l . .

For the last time during this school
year We extend to new students and faculty
members a sincere and enthusiastic wel-
come. You have been welcomed by the
pre. dent, by the administration, by the
deans by the l'aculty, and by the student
bod, almost can llually for a week and a
half. But Mr. Webster deliucs a welcome
as ”a cordi 1 greeting, to or reception of, a
guest or newcomer,” and these people are
no longer either guests or newcomers. In—
stead of continuing to welcome them we
should accept them as members and friends
of Grinnell College.

It is highly probable that we shall
have difficulty in doing so. You are a
large and very self-possessed group 01'
people. Changes ill ways of 1 line and
thinking will be required of us if Grinnell
is to continue to hold its significant place
in the development 01' a wOl able educa-
tional and social democracy. But several,
[auto are on our side.

First, living conditions are better by
far at Grinnell than at most colleges.

Second. the ten-to—one student-facility
ratio has been maintained here.

Third, many of the new students are
adults both in age and viewpoint, and
should be expected to furnish examples of
excellent adult conduct.

This process (it acceptance, howevclz.
cannot be a onersided affair. New students
will have to accept us, too. All of the‘
necessary adjusting- cannot be done by one,
group. nor by groups at all, but must be
achieved by every individual on campus.
