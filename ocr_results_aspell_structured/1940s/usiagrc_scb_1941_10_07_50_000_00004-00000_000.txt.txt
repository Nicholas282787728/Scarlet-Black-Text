The Midwest conference football
race rambles into its third week
with the Ripon Rednien safely
imbedded in first place. due to a
ﬁne offensive attack led by
sophomore Scalissi. The Redmen
have rolled up 27 points while

are in a tie for fourth in the
loop. will have a chance to hit
the 500 per cent mark this Satur-
day when they play host to the
old Siwash of Knox college.

The scarlet and black clad
gridders have been granted a
slight edge over Knox, despite
the fact that Lawrence defeat
ed Grinnell. 6 to 2, and Knox
held the vikings to a scoreless
tie.

Monmouth, and the Belaitrcol'r

QUESTION OF CARLETON: Last year Carleton college of North-
field, Minn, announced they would. withdraw from the Midwest con
ference unless the minimum number of football games to be played
by each school in the loop was cut down to foui and the numbei of
basketball games cut to eight . . At a formal meeting of confer-
ence executives last year the gioup v'oted not to cut the number of
games.

cause they have puhlicaliy stated that ll'hey have ivltlidroun,
and, also. they have failed to schedule the minimum number
of games. . i . But officially, Carleton has not notiﬁed li‘w
conference oisiocrs that they intend 00 drop out. . . i Carleton
also objected to the great distance hetireen schools competing
in the conference. . Those excuses do not seem to he
strong enough to 1 st y dropping out in our estimation, as

THE DRAKE Ganm: It was one to losei i . . About as bad as the
Dodgers losing to the Yanks Sunday after two were out in the ninth
. . . Two unlucky breaks for Grinnell netted the Bulldogs so yards in
their lone touchdown march. Coach Vee Green of the Drake
cloven said that this Grinnell team was the toughest outfit he had seen
in a long time,

AT RANDOM Every man taken on the Des Moines trip saw action
in the game. . . There's a rumor about that a pep band will be taken
with the team on the Colorado trip. . This sounds like a good
function and should develop past the rumor stage. , , . The football
relationship that has been in effect between Colorado and Crinncll
for four years seems to us should be extended for quite a few more
years. . Hospitality plus seems to be the significant characteristic

Scoring Plays

Jekel ls Sparkpluq
In Grinnell Offense
Againsf Drake Friday

By Phil OSlJOl‘lL
Lack of scoring punch once
more spelled dctcat for the Pier
ucers as Drake won the 49th an
nual contest 8 to 0 Inside the
Drake 20 yard line four times in
the first half. Grinnell failed to
have the necessary scoring oomph,
The starting team with three
sophomores and one senior in the
backfield played a far better
brand of ball than any Grinnel-
lians have been able to show
against Drake in several seasons

Too much cannot be said about
the line which consistently out-
chargcd the Bulldog’s forward
wall.

Ed Nagel‘s punting was ex
ceptionally good and put Drake
in the hole more than once.
Murray Richards shows promise
of becoming as fine a player as
his brother Dick, last year's
Northwestern captain

Don Hipple showed improva~
inent both as a runner and a
passer. But the team's sparkplug
was the blond blocker and signal
caller. Harold Jekcl, Only after he
left the game did the team fail
to rally.

The first team ran through
signal drills yesterday, and the
rest of the squad scrimmaged
ih preparation for Saturday's
game with Knox.

Emphasis during this week will
be put on developing scoring
plays. .

Play on both sides was ragged
