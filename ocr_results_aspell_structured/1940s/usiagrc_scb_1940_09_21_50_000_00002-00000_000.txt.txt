. Advice fo’ Freshmen

With the issuance of prep hats to the fresh-
man New Student Days draw to a close
and prepping begins. Prepping at Grinnell,
like that at other schools, is solidly em-
bedded as one of the major traditions of
the college. And nearly as firmly entrench-
ed is the custom of the Scarlet and Black to
provide plentiful and free advice upon the
subjectius well as upon all others.

Thus, exercising this age-honored priv-
ilege of all college newspapers, we humbly
solicit the attention of our freshman read,
ers for the annual fatherly chat,

First, we enjoin you to recognize the
futility of too rugged an individualism. It
so happens that such an attitude is that
which is least appreciated by the upper-
classmen. Consequently, they combine to
combat it. And we pllt it up to you: What
chance has one freshman against a. coali-
tion of his elders?

Second, we should like to suggest that
you remain semiAcheelful about the whole
matter—'at least on the surface, The com-
plaining freshman is quickly spotted and is
quickly disliked, not only by the upperclass-
men but by his colleagues as well. After

all, it is rare that the duties required of
you will overtax your strength or consume
more than a modicum of time. ‘

And third, we suggest that you exer»
cise that greatest of all virtues—patience.
Perhaps certain of the demands made upon
you will seem foolish, even distasteful. They
may be. But that is no reflection upon
you, but rather upon the dimm'itted upper-
classmcn who makes the demand. There are,
unfortunately, several of that category at
large upon the campus. But you can not
help that, Instead, be patient and resolve
not to follow their infamous example.

With that we complete our duty and
render your innocent souls unto the hands
of the godsA—andlhe upperclassmen.

 

Q Grinnell Rejuvenated

To those who have returned to the cam,
pus with the memories of former years at
Grinnell still fresh, the spirit now pervading
the entire college is noticeable for its newly
acquired vigour.

And nowhere has this energy been more
concretely evidenced than at Convocation on
Thursday morning. In the rousing spon-
taneity of the applause accorded President
Samuel N. Stevens at that service, lloth the
faculty and the student body indicated the
eagerness with which they welcomed the
sixth president of Grinncll college. Nor did
it appear to us that that welcome arose
only for the man, but also for the aggreSs
sive policy which he represents and upon
which he has already embarked. Our wel-
come, at least, included both

Similarly, the Convocation address by
President Stevens was alive with the sub-
stance of the rejuvenated Grinnell spirit,
Concise, pertinent and well~delivered, it
glowed with the confidence of greater
achievements for Grinnell,

Yet, with its indications of future tri
umphs for the school, President Stevens’
speech threatened no absolute break with
the past, no resounding overthrow of the
great traditions which have become as iden—
tified with the college as its name. Instead,
although his pledge was for a different
Grinnell, the president gave assurance that
it would be founded upon the finest in its
history.

This new spirit embodying both an eag-
erly welcomed program for the future and
a recognition of the values of the past can
not fail to spell success if its constituent
parts can be presented in proper proportion.

A COLUMN 0F Him:
BEAUTY

To PREPS

For all you new guys, for summer
cute,

This is advice of Wisdom pure

Study real hos-d and crack those
books

And stay away from beckoning
looks.

Keep minds clean—don't run up
hills

Eat Carter’s Little Liver Pills.

Go to bed early and get up quick

Don't cut class can though you’re

 

sick
Don't date at all and watch your
rep
It you follow this you’re a hell of
a prep.

Blotter Proves
That Zephyr Is

Still on Campus

The Grinnell college Zephyr, “only
Grinnell humor magazine west oi
the Mississippi," according to the
Grim-l5]! blotter, is still on the
campus, if we are to believe John
McCune. editor. McCuhe pointed
to a nearby blotter lo prove the
fact

“This year,” McCune said,
“Zeph will have the biggest staff
in its history. Fred Pauls, our
business manager, will have two
assistants, Kenet Pearce and Wilr
liam Lewis."

“oh the writing angle, I’ll be
assisted by William Buckley, who
is serving as associate editor,
Roberta O'Harl'a, women's editor,
and the editorial staff made up of
Ray Nelson, Jamcs Russell, Jo
Slnith, Lois Stewart. Ken Math—
en's and William Grllenwalil. Art
Work will be handled by Robert
,Artley and Arthur Barrett,” he
carried on.

When is the first staff meeting?

"Probably sometime next week
at his new Zephyr office, lo-
cated either on the White House
steps, the lawn in front of the
library. or in a booth, downstairs
m the White House. By ihe way,
be sure to say that unyoncwishihg
lo write for Zephyr should see
either the women's editor or
myself."

Correction

lu Wednesdays Scar.t and
Black Joseph Becker was incor-
rectiy called an instructor of
women's physical education.
This is obviously wrong, Beck~
er is instructor in drama and
Miss Helen Clanahan is the
instructor in physical educa-
tlon.

New Electric Organ

A new Hammond electric organ
was installed in Herrick chapel
today to scrve until the new pipe

When the pipe organ is com-
pleted, the Hammond will be used

ment is portable, it will be moved
