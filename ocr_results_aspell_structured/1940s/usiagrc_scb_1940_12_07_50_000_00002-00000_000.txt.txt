C To the Honor GiOne Bouquet

The Honor G has often been the subject
of much criti ism. There has even been
some discussion around the campus as to
whether there is justification for having an
Honor “G” which is anything more than
an honorary organidztion.

But the present Honor "G", under the leﬂdv
ership of Edward Stone, has already estabs
lished d record oi" activities and policies
which nullify most of the past criticisms,
and it has most certainly proved itself to
be an organization with laudable purposes.

During the New Student Days the Honor
“G" helped organize a recreation program
for new Students. The swimming pool and
the tennis courts were made available for
their use and various other amusements and
games were provided.

The Honor “G” has (lone much this year to
stimulate a better school spirit toward the
football team. At each outeofetown game
telegrams were sent to the players to let
them know that the student body had coli-
i'idence in their victory. The Honor “G”
further promoted the spirit and good Will
of the school by sponsoring the banquet for

, the Colorado team.

Most outstanding about the Honor “G" this
year, is its new personnel system The club
has seen to it that it is respon ble to see
that freshman athletes who are not doing
as well as possible in their academic work
are given special guidance and assistance in
organizing their work and in keeping their
grades at a reasonable level. Moreover the
club has made it a policy to make prepping
d more intelligent tradition with a max
mum of healthy reprimand and a minimum
of "prep—beating.”

Another of this year’s accomplishments of
the organization is the removal of its state
of insolvency. The club either has paid or
is able to pay 011’ the debt of several liune
(ll'etl dollars carried over from last year.
Finally, the Honor “G” has made some
1' ther definite steps toward a seller initia-
tion. Among other things, the club helped
Mr. Wittler in his fine charitable spirit by
instructing initiates to collect old clothes
for distribution among some of the poorer
families in Gi‘illnell.

Let us hope that the Honor “G” will co -
tinue to Show such a good, constructive at
tilde in the future and that it may become
an even stronger influence in the creation
of a better Grinnell.

Mrs. Combosi Sees Vast Difference in School Systems

Those who wish to Specialize his
particular field must attend c

hcsi.

A great difference in compare
son to our universities and colleges
which was pointed out is that no
course has any determined length.
The time spent at the university
depends cntiicly upon the individ-
ual. There are no examinations
until a studcni has applied on»
his doctor's' degree, with the c.
ccption of those Stlldying' inedn

“You know, of cmusc, there is
no charge for sciiiicnts at col-
lcgc.n the inusicinn stated. She
continued, saying that the siuic
pays for everything and even at

' that there is a smaller enrollment
in the collcgcs in Sirltzerland
than in those of the United
States.

in order to study musical tech-
nique, a student must attend c
spacializcd academy, The cur ,
culuni at one of these acadcm' s
includes other courses in music as
well,

"However," she said, “very few
students continue woi-k alter a
course at the university. “Gradu-
atlon." she said, “does not mean
nearly as much in .Europe as it
does in the United States."

The main difference she has
noticed in the musical education
is that we concentrate so much
more on bands and have much
less chamber music than Eurov
pea" schools.

News Views

Expanded U.S.Al’d
To England Seen
, As Dangerous

—-By Williiun D. Bin-ls,—

It is with little surprise that
News Views notes the increasing
agitation for expanded aid to
Great Britain. As early as 52137
tcmbcr 27, 1939, in a column ap-
pcnniig on that date, we forecast
that the modification of the then
existing Neutrality Act to favor
British \\'7)l‘ efforts would sooner
or later lead to the extension of
credit and military aid to the
island empire.

Having already been fulfilled in
part, this prcdictian Seemingly
awaits only the opening of the
77th Congress before becoming a
complete leallty. Set off by Eric
ish Ambassador Loihizin's state-
ment that Washington must open
this country‘s Credit reservoirs to
His Majesty's Government if the
British cause is to perserve, the
clamor fci- all-out to England
has risen in a new crescendo
since the November election.

Assured now of the continuance
of an American administration
solidly committed to the B ltish
cause, English officialdom is im-
coming inci-c candid in its etfol‘ts
to secure this country's active
participation in the European
conflict. As yci, the dcniaud for
inch-power has not been publicly

quoted Lci-d Lothian as including
that request in his now-famous
statement.

Nor is John Bull’s diplomatic
corps alone in this growing agita-

innd-s official demands for more
