GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

After Meeting Friday—-

l’r's W. R. A. Now?

I

Action changing the name of the
Women's Athletic association to
“Woman‘s Recreation association"
was the principal business of the
meeting of the group last Friday
night, according to Betty Young,
president.

Two other changes in the con—
stitution made at this meeting
concerned provisions for member—
ship.

Women who desire to become
members must henceforth apply
for membership in addition to par—
ticipation in three different
sports. Points awarded in the
dance intramural were revised to
7 spoints for the winning team
and 50 for the team piecing sec
ond.

The w. R. A. plans to inaugur—
ate a bowling club, first aid club,
a nutrition course, and craft
club, following the Christmas holi—
days, Miss Young announced.

Women who wish to take part
in such activities need not be
members of the w. R. A., she
added.

Jim Rouge, nihole senior—“The
war with Japan is a good thing.
It will unite the United states.
It was coming sooner or later,
so the sooner the United states
is united the better."

William Gruemwnld, Smith son.
ior_I-d say that this attack by
Japan is the greatest thing that
could have happened to the
United States. We were already
in war. but some of the people
refused to admit it. Now we're
going all outﬁeven the Chicago
Tribune, and brother that's
unity.

Jack Frye, Smith junior—"The
United states is fighting on the
only front where she is really
prepared to fight. With the dec-
laration of war made yesterday.
we will have a unity which will
bring about the inevitable result
of victory. It can’t be expected
in a few, short weeks, however."

and as long as we are in it I
know we will lick them. Every-
body is going to be very emo»

be race prejudice against the

go into a great boom.”

Murray Welch, Smith junior—
"lt's no use going off halfecocir-

sound judgment and help the

Must Combat

War Forces
Says S’revens

“We must mobilize our per-
sonal power in order to com—
bat the disintegrating forces
of war," President Samuel N.
Stevens told the student
body in a complllsorary
chapel this morning.

The college will be proud
of those who are called away
to the service, he said, but
the hardest job will be for
those of us who stay at home,
and try to “stick to our
knitting.”

We shaii be no less patriots,
Stevens emphasized, if we live
each day's life in the terms of
work which must be done.
Conard Speaks.

Earlier in the chapel program,
Dr. Henry s. Cunard, in a brief
talk, called for "trained minds
and dicipiined wills."

The sorrows of war are in-
evidible, he said, but the bitter-
ness and frustration is up to us.

“We owe it to our cotuitry to
be stronger and better men and
Woman," Conard stated, “and to
do the right as we see the right,
with mouse toward none, and
charity toward all’.”

Hampton's Statement.

Kent Hampton, student coon
cii president, asked the students
to make use of their opportunity
to "build the nation of tomorrow."

“We have the poise, courage,
and farsightedness," he said, “and
with that realization, we shall
be able to reconstruct the life
of the future."

We must be elastic in ac-
cepting social changes, {or
labor, and for the proletar-
iat at large. We must accept
increased Federal corporate
lite, necessary to adjust the
huge machinery of modern
business.

But we can, and we will,
prove that our bmlc philos-
