The point was brought up tlui»
ing the meeting that the system
of selecting three major Candi»
dates was unsatisiactory because
one candidate can usually threw
his votes to elect one of the other
men. It was the opinion of the
council that the two candidate
plan was superior to the old
system, although no official mo-
tion was made on the subject.

Also stressed by Council mem-
bers was the desirability of haw
mg active political campaigns,
which would result in chapel talks
in which candidates would tell
their qualifications.
