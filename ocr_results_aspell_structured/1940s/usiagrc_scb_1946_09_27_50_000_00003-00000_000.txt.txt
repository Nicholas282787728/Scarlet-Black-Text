Program Planned
For ln’rramurals

Trophies To Be Given
Al "Kick-off Dinner"

The fall season of an intensive
all-year intramural program was
planned by the men's Intramural
board Tuesday night, at its first
meeting with faculty advlsor J.
C. Truesdale. Schedules for m-
ter-hall competition In touch
football, golf, and crosscountry
were considered, with an import!
ant rule change regarding eligir
bility of participants in all in-
Lramural sports.

Touch football gets underway»

at 4:30 Monday, sept. 30, and
games are to be scheduled for
that time every Monday, Wednes-
day, and Friday thereafter, Golf
and cross-country meets are still
tentative. depending upon the
amount of interest shown by the
halls.

The only men ineligible for an'

intramural sport are men who

have at any time lettered in the:

varsity division of that sport,
either at Grinnell or at colleges
attended while in the service.
This is a change from the old
rule that prohibited all particir
pants in varsity athletics from
entering the intramural branch
of that sport, and is expected to
clarify the status of many of
the veterans now on campus.

The Intramural Board is com—5
posed of delegates from each afl

the men's halls, who meet with
Prof. Truesdale to determine pol—
cies, make up schedules, and to
settle questions arising from the
intramural program. Hall dele-
gates for this year are, smith,
Art Woodward; Rawsoii, Jim
Hammond; Gates, Al Johnson;

Clark, Bud Baker; Dibble, chuck‘

McMurray; Langan, Clem Saun-
ders, and Cowlcs, Vernon Merle
singer.

One function to be sponsored
soon by the board, is a “Kick—off
Dinner,” at which the Gardner
and the Miller trophies for the
year '42-'43 will be presented.

the physical education depart-
ment, has released the details of
the men's physical education pro—

mural sehedule intended to cone

tion classes.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

,Mee’r Ben Douglas

 

 

 

 

 

 

Ben is a blond, blue-eyed man
whose almost slight build belies
his former athletic prowess. He
lls a friendly fellow who prefers
lnot to talk too much but rather
lwncentrate on whipping his ball
lclub into shape and letting rer
lsults speak alone.

i Douglas returned to his alma
‘mater in 1940 to take over the
reins of the Pioneer grid teams
which had been slumping disas-
ltrously in the preceding years.
In his first year as coach the
Pioneers had almost the best
record since Ben himself had
been a Grinnell star in 1930. Ben
graduated in 1930 after an out-
standing athletic career in which
he became one of the few ath-
lets in Grinncll history to win-
nine letters.

He began coaching at the
Greenfield, 1a. high school in 1931
,and ‘next year coaced at Cornell
college at Mount Vernon, Is. He
took a fling at professional foot»
hall with the Brooklyn Dodgers
in 1933 before going to Maple-
wood, Mo., high school in 1934»
