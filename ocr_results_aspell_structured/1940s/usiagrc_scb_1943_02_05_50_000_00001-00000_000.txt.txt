No Changes
In L5 Ruling.
Says Bea’rl‘y

College Forced to Adopi‘
Strict Interpretation
of Clause During War

There will be no change in the
requirement that a student make
a 1.5 grade average to remain in
good standing at Grinnell, an
nounced Dean Shelton L. Beatty
yesterday, denying that the col»
lege is contemplating a change
in the established ruling.

Failure to make such an aver-
age results in the student being
,put on probation for the follow-
ing semester,, and in case of a
second failure the student is liable
to dismissal from college.

Beatty made the statement in
answer to a query about the pos-
sibility of students being required
to leave college at any time dur~
ing the semester that their grade
point average fell below 1.5.

During peacetime, this ruling
has been interpreted rather liber—
ally by the college. with special
allowance being made for individ
ual cases, said the Dean.

However, because of the war,
and the fact that most of the
men students are in reserves the
college is forced to adopta strict-
er interpretation of the rule.

"11 a student cannot or does
not do his work today, there is
no excuse for his being in Grim
men," said Bcatty. -
