FRANKLY, IT SMELLS

We think that there will be little dissension
on the campus when we put the finger on
one of the most unpleasant situations in
Grinnell college today and declare, frankly,
it smells.

It, in this case, is the hot water [lowing
a pale brown, and, at strategic moments
when we are late for a date or dinner, at a
minimum rate from the faucets of residents
of the quadrangle and dormitory.

The Grinnell college water supply has
been a perennial trouble-maker. With every
burst of indignation, coming at wellrspaced
intervals denoting the time it takes for col-
lege students to arouse themselves enough
to really object strenuously, the tinge of the
hot water obligingly changes from a deep
brown to an anaemic ochre; and then, as the
students accept a change for the better as
an accomplished fact, out comes a jet black
ﬂood with a stench that has been known to
blunt the needles on a potted cactus plant in
the next room.

The idea, then, seems to be that some»
one should get “on the ball," clear up the
trouble, and allow Grinnell college students
to return to the idyllic days when hot water
meant that which got you clean.

KOHN'S TINTMASSES

There is no culpability attached to acting in
accord with one's training. The terryear old
boy parts his hair 011 the left side because
it’s customary in his society. The American
aborigines were not culprits because their
mode of living was different from the col-
onists’. It is merely normal that a person’s
present actions and beliefs should be colored
by his past,

For that reason, it is not an accusing,
but an objective attitude with which we
state that Dr. Hans Kohn was looking
through tinted glasses when he lectured
here. And to understand the true import
of his ideas, we must understand those
glasses. We must know of his past ex-
periences

From his own autobiographical reminis—
cences while he was here, we found that he
had grown up accepting militaly training as
natural, and with the expectations of war.
He took part in the World War. Of course
he didn’t enjoy wading in slush up to his
hips, nearly dying on a desert, and seeing
the horror of actual fighting. But he does
enjoy telling about those experiences nowi
and unconsciously makes them enticing

And he did enjoy, as any man might
have, the spontaneous 'university" in prison

camp, the beautiful and peaceful mountain
prison camp, and the exciting adventure of
being one of a group of prisoners who stole
a train and travelled four thousand miles
before being caught.

But these experiences, his educatidn, his
choice of reading, and other facts which we
can’t surmise, all are part of his tinted
glasses,

We have lecturers here to give us their
ideas concluded from a richness of expel»
ience, but should we accept their statements
without examining those experiences?

WILL HISTORWEAT?

(Reprinted from the Marquette Tribune.)
Ever since Joseph Stalin launched his
blundering blitzkrieg against Finland,
Americans for the most part have been
sympathetic with the Films. But as the
Films themselves so aptly eklress it, they
need less sympathy and more material aid,

To assist Finland materially against
Soviet aggression would bring the United
States into direct conflict with Russian ani-
bition and indirect conflict with German in
terests. While Americans respect the Finns
as one of the few honest 1 oples of Europe,
this respect scarcely justi es plunging the
United States into a conflict which might
well be disastrous to the social order.

Sentiment, however, might well succeed
where reason would fail. At the beginning
of the last war, ill spite of the government‘s
determination to remain neutral, Anglophiles
and Francophiles bombarded Americans of
every condition and creed with propa-
ganda. Atrocity stories of Prussian bru—
tality in “brave little Belgium" reached the
American press and were believed to be true
though possibly exaggerated. British sub-
sidized movies such as “Over the Top” and
"Hearts of the World" did almost as much
as the German U-boats to involve America
in the war.

America did not rush into war. The
movement is better described as drifting. It
took app Vimately three years to condition
the American people to war. First there was
a general horror of conflict, this was fol-
lowed by sympathy lor the invaded and
hatred of the invader, then when the in-
vader challenged American rights on the
high seas and committed acts against Amerie
can shipping, war was the inevitable result.

The first two stages of war condition-
ing are already ill operation in this country,
the thild and fourth can occur only if the
plesent nelltlality law is violated or loop—
holed. All of which makes helping Finland
a serious problem. Spalks of sentiment
fanned by propaganda should not be allowed
to kindle the flame of war in this country.
Common sense and sound reasoning should
keep America neutral, allowing her to pros—
per in peace. G

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“The unit we must work with is the i11~
dividual human being, and We are comillg
to understand that the student can’t be
subdivided either. It won’t do to deal with
his intellectual side alone and neglect his
health and morale; we must reckon with
his esthetic and emotional side, and by in—
telligent guidance help him adjust himself
to the real world ill which he must live,
Educators have been saying these things
for years, now they are beginning to act as
if they believed them.” D1: Frederick P.
Keppel, Carnegie Corporation president
commends our teachers fol their new edl
cational policies

cultivation of human qualities of sound disA
passionate thinking, calm judicial judgment,

SATURDAY, MARCH 9, 1940

OPEN FORUM

To the editor:
This weekend sixty Grinnell Col»
lege band members went to Des
Moines to present a group of cone
certs before the Des Moilles high
schools. These students received
no cuts for the classes they miss—
ed wlule in Des Moines.

Last November Gl-innell beat
Coe in a football game, and
utter a lot at hemming ond
lmwing the faculty granted on
the students what has oom-
manly been called a, “Victory
Day." On this day, supposedly
dedicated to a celebration of
our victory over Coe, no cuts
were charged against students
through a faculty order.

Going back to the bond, supr
pose that some of the band mem-
bers had taken advantage of this
no-cut privilege and had gone
home, or had done something else
instead of taking part in the con-
certs. Quite naturally the faculty,
seeing that a, privilege had been
abused, would feel that some not
Ion should be taken, and would
do something about this abuse.

A somewhat comparable ev-
ent occurred lust November,
thu the faculty gave us our
”Victory Day" as a celebration
of a. victory, did we make the
proper use of it? Did we show
that we were celebrating a vio-
tory; that we were firmly be-
hind a football team that had
given us a victory to be proud
of? No! Half of us had not
even seen the game, but when
we heard that Grinnellhndwon.
saw a. chance to get u day-s
vacation from closses, and so
started a lot of cornpnignlng
under the name of school spirit.
when we got the “Victory
Day," a group of us quickly
high-toiled it out of tow-n for u
good time. Others of us out
home and studied or fiddled
around. A few students who
didn't have anything else to no
went to thc pep rallies.

Was that not an abuse of a
privilege granted to us, and
should we not expect a. response
from the faculty, as would the
band in this hypothetical case
mentioned ?

This plan of a regulated vic-
tory und pop day come to us
students from the student coun—
oil, but the council was only
acting at the request, or hod
we better say, the demand or
the faculty. It is reported that
the faculty committee told the
stuucnt council to either take
two regulated days or take
nothing,
Through our “celebration” of
our “Victory Day," we asked for
facility action, and we got it.
The question now is, how do we

 

like this new regulation?

Are we quite content to sit
around and see the whole idea
of having a possibility of a day,
or several days, if the occasion
demands, for a, spontaneous cel-
ebnﬁon of a wendeservod mm
victory—having this whole idea
calmly and quietly laid aside by
this faculty action?

We rightly deserved action, but
haven't we realized what 1: farce
we made of that lest so- -called
“Victory Day?" Havent we been
ashamed of ourselves for taking
this “Victoly Day” and abusing
its purpose? Don't we think that,
if we had the chance, we would
celebrate o “Victory Day" as it
should be celebrated, and not as a
last resort for a vacation from
classes?

We have heard many people
say that Gl-inuell studcns have
no spirit. We don't agree, but
it we sit around ond let this
cgulntion go through, what

ther conclusion can there be?
