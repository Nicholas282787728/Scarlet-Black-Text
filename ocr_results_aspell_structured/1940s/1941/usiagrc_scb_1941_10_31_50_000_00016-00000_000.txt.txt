In Homecoming Game Tomorrow

Douglas Plans lo Use
Slrong Aerial Allock
For Scoring Punch

By Phil Osboiite,

Featuring a pass attack sec»
0nd to none seen on this
campus in nearly a decade;
the Pioneer gl-iddel-s take
the field tomorrow as favoritcsin
the Homecoming game With the
Blue Devils from Beloit. Grinnell's
chance for the Midwest confer-
ence title rests on the outcome of
the game tomorrow

With Murray Richards, Don
Hippie; Bob Hninami. and Ed Nae
gcl alt heaving the pigskin, rind

, . With Jack Me
Crane. Hugh
' McCartney, Tod
Kennotiok. and
Haiiy Waters
on the catching
cud, Grinncll
presents an ser-
ial attack that
promises to be
potent
Inj‘iu‘ies and
bad weather have out down on
heavy scrimmages during the
past week, but scoring punch has
remained the main objective.
Injuries Crop Up.

Where once the end prospects
were the brightest of the entire
squad, injuries to three of the
four best men have weakened the
flanks considerably.

Kennefick will return to action
for the first time since the Knox
game, but his service will prob-
ably be limited. Both Lefty Sory
and McCartney have leg injuries,
and it is doubtful that Sory will
see action at all. This leaves
Harry waters, who has started
the last two games, and Dean
Nowell, whose varsity experience
is almost nil, as the only unin—
jured ends.

Jekel Injured.

Harold .lekel, sophomore block-
ing back, suffered a recurrence
of an old leg injury and will be
out of the game Saturday.

Virgil Rees, number three sig-
nal caller, is back in uniform and

Arnold, president of the group.

Since the set-up of the white
house has been changed consider-
ably, Town men as well as Town
women hold their meetings now
in the Associations building,
Theetore both groups are collab-
orating in putting up the decor
ations there, Arnold said.

Details about the theme of
their decorations were withheld
by Arnold Those in charge of the
decorations are:

Phyllis Osborn; Dorothy Tarle—
ton; Lois Clifton, Don Van Riper;
Gene Mills; Reynolds Norton; and
John Barnes

Vanstrom for Grinnell’s second
touchdown in the final quarter.
