0 Spring, Stevens, and Amherst
When events come to such a pass that one
can’t find something to blast at ill an edi-
torial it means that either the energy in the
universe is dissipated, we are dead above
the shoulders, or it is spring.

It isn‘t spring yet, and scientists say that
the universe is good for 1,000,000 years.

It must be that we are asleep or doped.
We could hardly be held morally responsible
for anything said under such conditions.

When Pres. Stevens returns, what will be
the good word? Will discipline mix well with
spring?

Amherst college has succeeded in break
ing up the pre-spring doldrulns with alco-
hol. They give a trophy for large capacity

claimed that the boys actually keep in con-
dition the year around. These people have
the courage to face brute fact.

Amherst’s Zephaniah S. Moore trophy is
not, “just a drinking boot, but a college in-
stitution" to quote the Amherst Student.
The tournament is built around a set of
gentlemen's agreements which show an as-
tounding consideration for the dangers of
insobriety. “(1) All drinking must take place
at the table as distinct from on or under.
(2) 10 ounce glass, (3) Collar not to exceed
7/16 inch. (4) five minute free period after
each round. (5) No beer will be served to
minors. (6) Competitor may not use his own
glass as a missile or his opponent’s as an
ash tray."

We are not suggesting, we are just won-
dering, Moreover, we are disgusted at the
thought of anyone drinking beer, particle
lal'ly if they drink like gentlemen.

But the pie—spring doldrums must be
broken up somehow, and we seem to have
no solution other than a political campaign
and a breathless anticipation of the good
word from California, We sincerely hope
that Dr, Stevens will re-inject some life in
Grinnell. But again, we reiterate, will dis—
cipline mix with spring?

We’ve been polite, but the meals
around here are still lousy, Those
allegedly "poached" eggs thrown
cc water hush Thursday noon, the
slimy egg casserole Friday noon,
and the raw meat loaf. with fried
filet of gslosh on the side have
had their precedents in old meat
