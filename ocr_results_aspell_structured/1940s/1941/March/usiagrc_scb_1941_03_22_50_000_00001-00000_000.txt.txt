Committee Working
On Plan to Create
Board of Religion

If plans now under discussion
materialize, it appears reasonably
certain that the Young Men’s
and Young Women’s Christian
association will no longer be in
existence on the campus.

Such were the sentiments ex-
pressed iast night by Henry Rust,
president of the Y. M. C. A,, who
said that plans were being made
to create a Board of Religion,
made up of both men and wo-
men, which would fill some of the
functions of the “Y" organizer
tlons.

Rust, who emphasized the fact
that homing definite had been
accomplished, said that be, along
with Mary Alice Beck, president
of the Y. w. C. A.; Evelyn M.
Gardner, dean of women, Shelton
L.‘Beatty, dean of men; Reverend
Leland L. Mann, acting dean of
chapel; and Pres. Samuel N.
Stevens had been working on the

plan.

Rust expressed the belief that
the Board of Religion would take
over the duties of arranging
chapel and Vesper programs,
would be responsible for new stuv
dent days, and would publish the
Freshman Handbook.

The y. M. C. A. has said they
will not elect new officers for
next year, but the Y. w. C. A.
will elect officers March 26. ac-
cording to Mary Alice Beck, pres-
ident.

Further Details
Are Still Unknown

of the President, will be on
the faculty of the Grinnell
Institute of Intemational Re
lations this summer, Max
Burke, executive secretar ,
announced this morning.

“She will probably speak on

racy Work at home," he said.

details later.”

liollr credit course is being

Males Maintain
Red Corpuscles,
Report Reveals

While many of Grinnelrs more
conservative brethren may feel
that the present crop of Pioneers
leans toward the long-hair, shoe-
striug muscle type, actual figures
show that red corpuscles still
come to more than ten to the gals
lon among Grinnell males.

As proof of this statement, a
report from John C. Truesdale,
director of intramurals, reveals
that threefourtbs of the men at
Gl'illnell participate in either var-
sity or intramural sports,

0f the total male enrollment of
374, 249 indulge in one or the
other sports' fields, figures Show.
