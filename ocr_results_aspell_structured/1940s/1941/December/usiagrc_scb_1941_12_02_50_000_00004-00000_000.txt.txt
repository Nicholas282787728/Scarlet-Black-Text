GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Cagers Meet Coe in Opener Saturda

Douglas Says, Team Looking
Fair, Lacks Reserve S’rreng’rh

With the opening game of the 194142 basketball season only
four days away, Coach Ben Douglas has been drilling his
squad hard on fundamentals and plays,

The scarlet and black
quintet opens its season
next Saturday night,
when they engage Coe
college in a game to be
played at Muscatllle.

Douglas Says ‘Fair’.

After a week of drilling the
team looks fair, according to
Douglas, but lacks reserve
strength, especially at the ccnter
position. Joe Dykstra, six foot
eight reserve from last year, has
not reported for practice as yet
due to a leg injury in the Colu-
radc football game.

Against the Kohswks Douglas
will start Capt. Paul Patterson
and Ralph Youngstrom at for»
wards; Hugh McCartney at the
center position; and at the
guards Douglas has his choice of
Tod Kcnnefick, Edd Bowers, Hare
ry waters. or Dean DeWitt.
However at this point it seems
that Kennefick and Bowers will
get the starting nod.

Face Coe angers.

“They will be all we can
handle," Douglas said in come
menting an the Coe cagcrs. In
Moss and Tschgil‘gi the Ko~
hawks have two fast tcrward men
who are shaipshooters, The Coe
quintet employs a fast breaking
offense with these two men as
the spearhead of the attack.

Following the Coe game the
Grinnell cagers return to the
home court to battle the Law
rence vikings on Friday, Decem-
ber 12 in the opening home coir
ferencc tussle of the season.
