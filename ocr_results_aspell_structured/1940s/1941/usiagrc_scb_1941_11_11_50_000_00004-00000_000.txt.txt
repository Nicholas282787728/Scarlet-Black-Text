Pioneers Meet Coe Saturday Mann Pi+c

Gridders Seek
Fifteenth Win
Over Kohawks

A fifteenth victory over the
Coe football team will be the
objective of the Pioneers as
they take the field against
the Kohawks in their final home
game Saturday.

Although Coe has been weaker
than usual this year, Coach Ben
Douglas said that this is the
game the Kohawks want most
to Win,

Third Place Guaranteed.

A Pioneer win would mean at
least third place in the final
conference standings, If Mona
mouth should lose to Knox this
weekend, Grinnell could come in
second, and if Knox and Mons
mouth should tie, Griunell and
Monmouth would tie for second.

Grinnells’ four game winning
streak came to an end last
Saturday on a snow-swept wis-
consin gridiron as Ripon’s Rede
inen scalped the invading Pio-
neers.

The story hinged about two
great running backs, Ted Scalissi
and Ken Miller, who led the Red
men’s attack. Together they pene-
trated the Pioneer line, and it
was Miller who slashed his way
across the goal for a first quar-
ter touchdown.

Scalissl kicked the extra point.
In the.f‘inal period Miller scor-
ed. Both scores came about as
a result of Pioneer mistakes and
the ability of the Ripon boys to
capitalize.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK’

 

For the first time in five
games, G'in‘ncll’s goal was cros-
sed, and it was the first time
this season that any Pioneer op-
ponent had scored during the
first half.

But the game was not all
Eipon, for in the Grinnell back-
ficld Jack Mcorane some
pleted six out of 13 passes to me
two tall ends, Hugh McCartney
and Harry Waters.

And the Pioneers had a runner
in the person of Augie oruening
who was almost as slippeiy as
Seatissi and'Millcr.

But once again the
punch just wasn‘t there.
Dykstun Praised.

Douglas praised the work of
Joe Dykstra at tackle dining the
entire second half, and also of
Waters, Gruening, and McGrane

captain Louie Gonias played
his usual great game although
Douglas said, “Meatball" was
handicapped more than the others
by the slushy field.

“Curly" Bishop, who sprained a
thumb. was the only injury victim
for the Pioneers.

Ripon’s win gave them
conference championship 7 their
sixth since 1929—and dropped
Grinnell to third for the week's
standings.

Passing and Running

With Doc Mann pitching the
pigskin first to Grover Milli-
kin for the touchdoun, and
then to Don Jacobs for the
extra point in the first half, the
All-stars began and ended the
scoring for the evening as they
downed Gates 7 to 0, last Friday
night.

Gates‘ passer, Ed Ahrens, was
bottled up most of the game by
the Allrstnr defense. and when
he wasn’t covered, his receivers
were.

Touchdown cnllcil nook.

In the fourth quarter Ahrens
passed to Ralph Hart who ambled
about half the length of the
field to pay dirt. But the play
was called back becauSe the
passer was too close to the line
of scrimmage.

Mann and Paul Boat sparked
the All-stars in the backfield,
and MllLikin looked good up front.
Ahrens, Hart, and George chafa
played host for the losers.

100 Brave Cold.

Gates was hampered by the
loss of three starters in the
line, and the cold made Ahrens’
passing far less effective than
usuali

A crowd of about 100 braved
the cold and huddled under the
press box to watch the teams
perform. During the half the

golf trophy was presented to
the Town Men and the football
trophy to Gates.
