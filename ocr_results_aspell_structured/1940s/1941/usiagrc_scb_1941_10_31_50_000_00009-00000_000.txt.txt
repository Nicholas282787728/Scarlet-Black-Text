Grinnell's Old

"Crackerbox" Era Encls

It's off with the old and on
with the new as far as Grinnell
college's building policy is con-
cerned.

With the announcement that
work will soon begin on the new
fielohouse, it becomes apparent
that Grinnell’s old gymnasium
will shortly fade into secondary
importance. The “crackerbox,” as
sportswriters often dubbed the
building, has stood now for some
41 years.

The cornerstone of the gymna—
sium was laid in 1899, and on
January 12, 1900, the new build-
ing was dedicated by President
Gates.

The Grinnell Scarlet and Block
of January 13. 1900, started its
account of the proceedings thus:

“The new Mens' Gymnasium, in
which all alumni, students, and
friends of the college cannot but
take pride, was formally dedicate
ed last evening. President Gates
presided and introduced a very
fitting program."

Dr. P. ,E. Somers, former Pio~
neer football star and graduate of
the class of '94, testities to the
fact that when it was bullt,Grln»
nell's gymnasium was one of the
ﬁnest in the land.

“The gym was the best in the
Mid-west and west of the Missis-
sippi, and people came from New
England and all over the East to
study it,” Somers slated.

Wifh New Gym

The first basketball game played
in the gymnasium was held March
17, 1900, with the Des Moines
Y. M. c. A.

The Scarlet and Black lost that
first encounter 14-6, but got re-
venge in 1901 when they trounced
the Y quintet 13‘10. That same
season, Iowa university came to
Gn‘nnell, and had to battle for a
25-21 win over the Pioneers.
