Bllilkens. Preceding the St, Louis
contest, the Bulldogs dropped a
35-32 decision to Washington uni—

171 count in the Valley standings.
O‘Connor Nets 30 roints.

In his two night stand against
the meruniverSltics in st. Louis,

give him a snappy start in the

for Di'ake"s defeat by Washing-

Drake is in thc midst of a week
of rest before racing Washburn

An expected feature of the
Washburn-Dralre game will be the
renewal of Wait 0' Connor’s pri-
