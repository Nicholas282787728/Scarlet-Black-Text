West Starts Organization of Madrigal Singing Group

Ability of Reading
Music Held Prime

Asset to Singers

A social accomplishment of Eliza-
bethan England is being intro-
duced on tho Grinnell campus by

J. Forrest West, head of the mu-'

sic department, who is beginning
work on madrigal groups, musi—
cal organizations popular in sev-
enteenth century England
Abihty to read music is the
chief requirement of madrigal
singers, according to West, for
the madrigals are intricate com<
positions, playing voice against
voice and melody against melody.
"We are especially interested
in students who have ability in
sight-reading. Madrigals seldom

require exceptional voices, but
they do rcqllrie exact reading,”
he said.

According to West, madrigal
groups were an important source
of entertainment 300 years ago.
“It was a necessary social accom-
plishmerlt to be a good madrigal
singer at Elizabeth's court. Such
singing is still a good social
grace, for madrigais are fun. Our
madrigal groups will afford more
actual recreation to their mem—
bers than any other music organ-
ization we have."

Rehearsal is the chief aim of
madrigal groups, West said, for
the counterpoint of melodies and
voices must be exact, if plans
materialize, several madrigal
groups of eight or ten voices each

will be formed. Each group is a
complete chorus, and as such may
plan individual rehearsals and
concerts.

“Though madrigals are some-
thing new in Grinnell," West com-
mented, “I have noticed several
voices well suited for madigi-al
singing, particularly among those
who tried out for the glee clubs.
1 hope all persons interested in
madrigal singing will contact me
at once."

Paralleling the madrigal groups
for students will be a similar or~
ganization for faculty members,
West announced. Bernard Sch .
ling, assistant professor of Eng-
lish, and Miss Mary Wrany, in-
structor of piano, are assisting
West with the faculty group.
