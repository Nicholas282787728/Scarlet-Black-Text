Buckley Admi+s~--

Zephyr Is Willin'

Grinnell‘s most popular humor
magazine, in the opinion of Wil-
liam Buckley, the Zephyr, will
gladly accept contributions from
the student body. Buckley, its ed-
itor, admitted today.

“In the past. Zephyr has always
asked for student contributions
and received very few," Buckley
stated. “This issue, we hope to
establish a precedent by carrying
a record breaking number of cone
tributions.”

The success of this plan, like
the revived religious program,
rests entirely with the student
body. Buckley claimed.

All articles. poems, cartoons.
and short stories must be turned
in to either Buckley or the
Zephyr box in the college book-
store not later than Nov. 27. The
Christmas issue will be out Dec.
10.

“Hell has no fury like a wo-
man’s scorn" replied Buckley
when questioned why the mags»
zine would not survey the dormi-
tories to learn of quadrangle
”wolfesses."

port his statement.

Someone created a watch and
a universe. Both were created for
a purpose. AS it is assumed that
a watchmaker made the watch.
so it is deemed probable that
God created the universe

That being the scientific argue
ment, Bell stated the artistic one;
that God must be responsible for
the beauty in paintings. music.
and the universe. because that
seems more probable than that
such beauty just happened.

Halls To Receive
Less Money

There will be less money allotted
to each hall this year. according
to Kent Pearce, president of the
Council of House Presidents.

Since the allotments are based
on the number of men in each
hall it is natural that since the
enrollment drop. there should be
less money to distribute. Pearce
said,
meeting Monday night in the little
dining room of the men’s dormi-
tories.

Freshmen are to be commended
on the behavior over “Hell Week",
was the consensus of opinion of
this group, Pearce added.

liefs, saying that a man is not
religions till he is in unity with
God. To acquire this unity with
the infinite, he said. we must
realize that there is something
which eludes man’s senses, some‘
thing we cannot grasp, no mat—
ter what we observe. This my-
stery should be recognized as
God, he explained.

However, God does not wait
for us to search for Him, Bell
stressed. Christians present Cool
as someone who searches for us
till He finds us. “God is to be
found in Jesus Christ and in the
divine enterprise which God has
sent to us through Jesus Christ,”
Dr. Bell concluded.

Dr. Bernard lddings Bell, form-
erly professor of religion at
Columbia University and dean of
an experimental school there, is
a graduate of Chicago University
in the field of British diplomacy.

He later became interested in
theology and has done extensive
work in that field. He is a well
known figure in religious litera-
ture, having had several articles
published in The Atlantic Month-

ly magazine. and written several
books.
