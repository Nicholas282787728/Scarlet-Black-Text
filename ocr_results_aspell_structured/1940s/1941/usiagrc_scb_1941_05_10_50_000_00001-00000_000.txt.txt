Reporler 'Scoop Lurie Preys Thal—

Skies Slay Clear Al Carnival
—So Thal Varsily Club Mdy Prolil

By Howard Lul‘l'e

Phineas T. Barnum would prob-
ably turn in his grave if he were
to walk onto Ward Field today.
”There are some of those people
I said were born every minute."
Naturally, P. T. would he refer-
ring to the Hampton, Miles,
Pearce committee for the rein-
carnation of the Varsity club7
and H. M. & P

Hampered by Old Man Weather
and praying that Juptiter Pluvius
stays away, the boys have gotten
their carnival into good shape.
Hale's “Seven Rides" are on the
fair gi'oundsifour strong. But to
compensate for the three lett be—
hind, rides, students and outside
concessions are omnipresent.
Pitch—penny, bingo, nickel digger-s,
rifle range, knock the milkrbotr
ties, ets., are to he stepped on
at a turn.

Noticesbly lacking from the
"Dunk the Honor 'G' Man” stand

is Edward Stephen Stone. It is
the consensus of all veteran car-
nlcal folk that the athlete's club
would qllintuplc their earnings if
Stone would assume the throne
above the water.

To quote a prep drafted to
work on the groundFI‘Boy, I'm
broke, but I'd burn a buck just
to see Stone SWlm—five bucks if
necessary," Now it’s not that the
preps don't like Ed. It's 3115'. that
iwell, you know how preps are
toward their master and guider
when they are freed. They all
realize Ed was mighty nice to
them, But anyway, so would
provide anyone with copious
rounds of nmmunitiollijust to
try their skill.

So leaving the barkers to their
Listerine, and the workers to their
uMinute Rub,” we hope the
weather man and Hitler allow the
committee good weather to strut
their stuff.
