About Wood Losses

The threatened suit against
the freshman class seems to
have vanished, Kent Hampa
toll, president of the stu-
dent Council. said last night.

E. E. Preston, general contrac-
tor of Newton, who demanded
that the freshmen pay him $100
for the lumber that they appro-
priated for the Sept. 25 pep rally
bonfire, has not called the college
for more than a week. He last
talked with James Chaffee, presi—
dent of the freshman class, on
October 14, and since then has
kept silent.

After iipperclassmen had bumed
the first bonfire built on Sept. 24,
the freshmen began to collect
more wood for the pep rally the
next night.

This time their search took
them to the southern part of
town. A ruined building on Main
street attracted attention, and
they filled a wagon with the half-
charred boards.

Neglecting to get the owner‘s
permission, thcy started back
with their load to Ward field.

Two officers of the Grinnell
Police department were informed
of the wagondoad of wood and
of the chicken coops picked up

‘Steady’ Study Shows Students Prefer
Carbon Copies for College Campus Capers

By Bette Personctt.

Your steady romantic interest is
your counterpart, according to a
study on assortative mating made
by the sociology class studying
“Marriage in the Family” under
Dr. J. H. Burma, sociology in<
structor at Grinnell.

Fifty-four Grinnell college
steady couples were rated on a
basis\of 16 different criteria to
determine how much the two
‘partners resembled each other.
The markings ranged from 90
per cent for very close resem-
blance to sper cent for very
slight resemblance.

Couples are Alike

In general, ”steady" couples are
much alike, Burma said. Theoreti—
cauy, opposites attract, but not at
Grinne‘ll; for here the students
seem to sort themselves out and
pair off on the basis of their
physical, mental, psychological,
social, and cultural likeness, the
survey shows.

The highest degree of slikencss
was in looks. Good looking per-
sons go steady with others like
themselves, according to the
study. “Beauty and the Beast"
may be interesting, but you see
only infrequent examples of it at
Grinnell.

Thc lowest resemblace, just
barely above chance, was in class-
iﬁcation. Evidently the freshmen
gals just can't resist the dashing
upperclassmen, and the junior and

senior gals have an annoying ten-
dency to stay true to the last
year’s graduates.

Tieing for second highest de-
gree of resemblance were the re-
lated criteria of moral attitudes
and over atfcction. Likenesscs
here were 50 per cent higher than
mere chance. These high correla—
tions do not indicate necessarily
high morals, rather, than “birds
of a feather flock togeuier," re-
gardless ot their type of plum-
age.

The old saying, "blondcs marry

brunettes,” is contradicted by the
results of this study. Although
the average correlation was not
very high, only in a very few
cases were the “steadies” con-
trasts in complexion or in gener-
al build.

If you don't believe in written
I. Q. tests, then lookover your
“steady.” If you are average,
there is a pretty close resem-
blance in both your grades and

Gymnasium Construction

Will Be Started lmmediatel

Wood Roof Plan Approved
By College Trus’rees Friday

“There is no doubt that construction of the new gymnasium

will begin within two

business mission.

or three weeks,"
Stevens announced today before leaving for

Samuel N.
Chicago on a

Pres.

lnllnediate construction is being made possible by the
decisions of the trustees to use a wood roof of the
Lalllella type construction rather than one built of steel,

Stevens said.

Stevens also explained that the gymnasium will be erect-
ell at the south end of Ward field rat/wa- than on the pre-
monsly planned site near the present gytlmttsilim.

These decisions were reached at a meeting of the Build-
ing committee of the board of trustees ill Des Moines Friday

afternoon

The base plans of construction as already drawn were
approved, Stevens said, and the architects have been in-

structed to complete ﬁnal plans as soon
(Base plans include overall specifications

as possible. >
for the

building, foundation measurements, and other fundamen»

tal building requirements.)

Originally planned at a cost of

$100,000, rising building

costs have boosted the price on the same structure to ap—
pl‘ mately $125,000, Stevens said.

Over $100,000 had been raised to meet the cost of the new
unit, the Grinnell president said, in September. Plans for
building were set at that time, Stevens added, but defense
priorities ruled out the steel construction, The change to
the Lamella wood roof construction was necessary for that

reason.

iish classes, but this year ‘extra
copies are being printed, and will
be available in Aldeirs office.

Several copies will be bound in
an imitation suede cloth due to
shortage on paper because of de-
fcuse work, Alden added. The
