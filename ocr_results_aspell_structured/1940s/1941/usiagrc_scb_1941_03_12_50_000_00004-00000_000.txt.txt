contributed two men to the se-
lections.

The managers named an all-
star team from both the A and B
leagues, instead of combining the
best players on one mythical
teain, although the players in the
A league were not necessarily
more capable than those in the
B league

or the men picked for all-star
recognition, Jerry Grant, center
on Dibble's B team, was the only
one unanimously selected. He was
the only Dibblc player to make
the selections although Dick
Fort, younger brother of basket-
ball Co-capmin Jerry Fort, was
almost named at forward on the
A league selections.

feated team in either league,
placed two performers, ’Kent
Hampton and Dean Newell, on
the albstar selections Hampton
