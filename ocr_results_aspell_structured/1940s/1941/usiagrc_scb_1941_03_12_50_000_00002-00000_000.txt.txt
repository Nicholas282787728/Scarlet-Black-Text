0 Words of Praise.

To those gloomy individuals who foresee
ahead a time of economic stress and spillt-
ual strain, we suggest as a happy antidote
the cultivation of a plentiful stock of pleas-
ant memories. And certainly there are few
who will deny that the recent Junior Prom
will long remain in our memories as a re-
minder of more carefree days,

It is indeed a rare occasion when all event
on the campus commands the whole-hearted
approval and praise of the entire student
bod, Yet we feel safe in saying that the
Junior Prom was such a happy occasion.
The music was smooth and solid, the deco,
rations were novel and appealing, the whole
atmosphere was one of complete enjoyment
and satisfaction And to top it off, the
dance was a financial success.

As is always the case, successful events
just don’t happen. The idea of a really “big-

Juniors. After they had sold the Junior
Class on the idea, they were faced with the
infinitely more difficult problem of selling
the student body on the woi‘thrwhileness of
their scheme. This was accomplished _by
means of a masterful advertising campaign
and by a determination to succeed which
would not be denied.

We have only words of praise for those
individuals who sponsored the Junior Prom.
This is but one more evidence that G ‘nnell
students are capable of making their mark
in the outside world.

0 Postscript to Intramurals.

To our own amazement, this year we found
ourself dragged into the quadrangle dance
intramural. We emerged Friday night black
and blue in several places and stiff in sev-
eral others, gasped that we were glad it
was over, and collapsed with exhaustion
We had not achiEVed a. professional per-
formance, and from the comments of the
audience we gathered that not many other
people did either, But nobody expected us
to—certainly not us. And the reason we ape
prove of the dance intramural has little to
do with the final result

When you are in a dance intramural you
find out about people. You find out es-
pecially, of course, if you have to be respon—
sible, and have to browbeat people into par-
ticipating, browbeat them into taking care
of their costumes, bi'olvlieat them into com—
ing to rehearsals, Being among those who
had to be browbeate'rl, we were amazed at
what we saw. We observed that most people
may be numbered among those who, as they
say, make democracy a failure. We observed
that there is nevertheless something thrill-
ing in doing things together for a change;
like everyone else, we complained and had a
wonderful time.

It was ever thus. The inertia of the Grin,
nell student body, celebrated as it is, is no
isolated phenomenon; you will find it in any
institution It is a little sad, but it is heart—
enirlg to know that at least uhere there
are a few responsible people, we can be
forced to explore possibilities whose exist-
ence it was easier to deny. It is not the in
ertia of the many which makes democracy
a failure, but the energy of the few which

time: Junior Prom originated many weeks
ago in the minds of several

enterprising

makes it a success.

American Steps

To Totali'tariarli'sm
5y Winkln 0» MI.—

Today a great fear hovers over
the American publicia fear for
the future security of our demo-
cratic institutions and ideals.

It is a concern based upon a
two-fold danger to our demo—
cratic processes; invasion from
without and penetration from
within. Not only does the ox-
citable American public dread the
possibility that a horde of brown-
shirted Nazis will come to roost
oh the Capitol dome. imposing up»
on this nation a. military dictator-
ship not in the least to our lik»
ing, but it quakes, too, at the ac-
tivities of undercover fascist or-

ganizations and agents at workln\

the United states.

That these dangers to the 50A
called American way of life do
exist uml that so existing they
rumish umplc grounds for in-
creasing public concern is an in-
contoctahlc fact But, at the some
time, it would he unfortunate if
these threats to our republican
form of government axe oonst -
ered to bc the only—or oven the
premier—offensive against Ameri-
can democracy.

For, in fact, the real danger to
American democracy lies in quite

a different place: American pub-
lic opinion. It has been said that
the United States could easily
become a totalitarian powerinot
as a fascist state, but as an
ANTI-fascist state.

Foolish as that observation may
appeur upon‘thc surface, it is ucv-
ertheless true that the trend is
already in plain cviiiencc. Agen-
cies oi an authoritarian nature
have already made their appur-
onoc in nui- governmental set»up.
Conscription has become an ac-
ccptcd factor on the American
scene. The military—army, imvy
and nir—force—luis rec ived in.
creasing glorification as a. result
of our national delense program.
Censorship of the phcss is ulrcmly
m blue-print form.

Public opinion is being rapidly
moulded into one unvaried form.
Those who disagree, no matter
how honestly, with the national
and foreign policies of the admin-
istration are branded as “appea5<
ers," “uh-American," “umpat -
otic"—:Lre denounced as “fiftl'b
col-uninists,” unwanted and dis-
liked.

And this we are doing in the
“am of democracy, because we
want to preserve that glorious
form of government for it surfer-
iiig world. But in so doing we are
destroying here in their last
stronghold, those very principles
of which we declare ouisclvcs to
be the gallant defenders. For what
are these new national character.
istics of ours but tmpplngs—rper—

Nor have We adopted them
against our will; these fascistfen-

tures have not been forced down
our gullets by gooscstcpping
storm troopers or slinking Nazi
spies. We have adopted them be
cause we wanted to, because We
thought it the wisest course. Per-
haps it is. That we are not arguA
mg. But the fact remains that
if this country becomes totulh
tarian, it will become so because
the pcoplc of this nation want it
to become so And in that fact
lies the greatest danger to Amer
ican democracy.

Mark Moody, senior music ma-

permission to give joint rather
than solo recitals in order to give
him the necessary time to devote
to the show, West stated. Senior
music majors must give recitals
as a. graduation requirement. '

Simons Lists German Trends

“It is upon human beings that
new orders are built. and no no.
tron can challenge the trend in
human order,” Dr. Hans Simnns
said last night in the series of
history lectures.

“The Germans have been said
to be excellent organizers, but
poor rulers," he said. At present,
he pointed out, there is friction
between the party and the army,
and hate is being created in op-
posing forccs. The actions of the
party weakened the economic sys-
tcm cf conquered nations, and
the people of Germany aie be
coming socially conscious. The
general trend is toward a change
in the present order.

“The conquest of Europe began
with the invasion of Germany by
the National socialistic party,”
Simons stated. He then discussed
the conquest of individual coun-
trics, leaving out pscudomcutral
nations such as Switzerland and
Sweden, whose positions he de<
fended.

One group of conquered counc
tries were those whose identity
and individuality have been ere
tinguished, First among these
was not too unwilling Austria,
which is now known as West
Germany. Next in order was
Czechoslovakia, now run by a.
puppet gcvcmmcnt which sup-
presses the people. The third of
this group is Poland, where no

To thc editor:

I take this opportunity to voice
my appreciation of the Work ac-
complished by the Student Coun-
cil and especially that of the
committee that worked out the
new clcction procedure.

The convention system, an im-
portant mechanism in the revised
elecﬁon scheme, permits the stu-
dents to assure a more active
part in the selection of the stu-
dent council prexy. Under the
new plan they will do more than
moi-cut cost it ballot, or, as in
many cases in the previous years,
have the local politician cast
said ballot foi- them.

The convention will give the
delegates some worthwhile ex-
perience in working with people
whose views do not coincide with
their own, who may be bigoted,
and others who may be readily
swayed. The convention will prove
an opportunity for underclassmen
to become leaders on their merits.

But above all the new ar-
rangenient brings the whines
out into the open. From now on
the dirt slinging will take plane
in publici This very fact will win!
to bring to the office 01 council
prexy the man who can mt
stand up under open electionccr-
ing.

Practical politics has come to
Griniiell, and it should bring more
able Student Council presidents
. . to say nothing of creat-
ing a‘ capable group of small
BMOC'S from whichlto choose for
the other important campus of<
(ices. The committee has done a
fine job in making the election
a. pragmatic procedure.

According to Moody, the show
is so written that individual parts
can be rehearsed, and it will not
be necessary for the entire cast
to be present at all rehearsals.
“Only at the last will it be
necessary foi- everyone to be
there." he added.

puppet government could be es-
tablished and therefore the at-
tack was made upon the smud—
iug of the pcoplc in society,
Simon: commented,

The second group, he contin-
ued, includes those which still
have their name and, in some.
cases, a. certain degree of indiv—
iduality, namely: Denmark, Nor-
way, The Netherlands, Belgium,
and France. France, however,
presented a. different situation be-
cause of the strength of the ex-
Isting govcmmcnt. These coun.
tries are being exploited by Ger-
many by means of forced labor
control (Where possmle), looting,
and demands of payments for
protection.
