Wyckoiilc To Leave GrinneII
Af’rer Long Teaching Service

Gi‘innell’s claims to instilling
in its students a strong sense
of social consciousness, of the
individual’s responsibility to
his fellows and his community, is
not without foundation in fact. In
addition to many men and women
who have gone out from the
college and shown by their subse-
quent activities in many hues of
endeavor that they have this feel-
ing, Grinneil has turned out a
notable list of active social work-
ers. Among these is Professor
Garrett P. Wyckoff.

Perhaps no one on the Grill-
llell faculty has, throughout
the years, done more than Dr.
Edward A. Steiner to make
the college known from one end
of the United States to the other,
From the lecture platform, the
pulpit, and through his many
books he has made himself a na-
tional figure and made the col-
lcgc known,

At the same time his direct in—
fluence on the thousands of stue
dents who have gone out trom
Crinncll during his as years of
teaching here is immeasurable.
Few students of the college have
ever left without having been e
rolled in one or more of his clas'

Was Born in Slovakia,

Dr, Steiner. a staunch teacher
and liver of the Christian doo-
trme, is a man to impress his
students, friends, and others with
whom he has come in contact as
a quiet, earnest, yet keenly jovi-
al person on occasion, a man who
has lived the traditionally pleasA
ant and protected life of a col-
lege professor, writer and lectur-
er. Were his life story told, how-
ever, Without dates and names to

er was educated in the public
schools of Vienna and the “Gym-
nasrum" at FilSen, Bohcmi . He
then attended the University of
Heidelberg and later the univerr

pilgrimage during his student
days to the home of Tolstoi left
a deep impression upon him,

An indiscreet interest in revo~
lutionary literature made him an
Object of suspicion to the Hun

warning made him a fugitive and
an emigrant to America. His
book, “From Allen to Citizen"
tclls a moving story of his escape
as a youth from the clutches of
a despotic government to our
shores, and the struggles of a lone
immigrant with inhospitable ele-
ments in this land of the free.

From air extraordinary variety
of usually discouraging adven-

last to Oberlin, where he found
spiritual peace and a vocation,

was ordained as a Congrega-

Our Gain.....

.Publication of this special edition
in tribute to faculty members soon to
retire brings to mind the part each
has played in the cultural, civic and
social life of the Community as dis-
tinct from Gl‘innell College.

0 In the past they have contributed
generously of their time, talent and
resources toward making Grinnell :1
better town in which to live.

0 Freed now of the burdens of study
and research, writing and class rou-
tine, they are ill a position to devote
more of their talents to the welfare
of local citizens and the town in

C We feel confident their public spir-
it and sense of Grinnell’s social and
cultural problems will be sufficient
inducement for them to continue the
work they “have thus far so nobly

.Indeecl the College’s loss is the
Community’s gain.
