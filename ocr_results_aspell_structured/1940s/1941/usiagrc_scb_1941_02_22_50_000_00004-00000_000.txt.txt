I How About the Musical Show?

This being a year of innovations and and changes, it is not

at all sul

ising that some prolific imagination has brought

forth tlle idea of producing a musical show at Grillnell, writ-
ten, directed and performed by students.

This proposal has undoubtedly come as a disgusting shock

to many who are already fedeup with conventions, curriculum
plans and constitutional revisions, all of which have inter-
ferred with the lethargic inactivities of our past lives. The
small group which still has the time and the courage to do
nothing but drink cokes and sleep is about to face once more
the horrible possibility of becoming interested in something

There have actually been no strong sentiments express
from the student body against the production of an orig (1
show, either because they don’t know about it or because
the ythink they can keep out of it. But there has been some
opinion voiced by a few members of the faculty against such
a project. There are two principal objections. The first is
that it is impossible to write, rehearse and present a show
within the relatively short space of two or three weeks. The
second is that there are already too many plays, social func-
tions and lectures slated for the coming spring.

In answer to both objections let it be emphasized that the
stock excuse for doillg nothing about anything around here
is lack of time. This is almost universally the easiest ration-
alization of plain, stupid misuse of time.

Specifically, in answer to the first objection let us re-
mind the dissenters that all the music is written in finished
form, the general plan of the production is already outlined,
and many people have expressed a positive interest in the
acting, singing and dancing At least a fourth of the neces-
saly work has already been done. There is no good reason
why an acceptable show can not be workedlp within the next
two or three months, considering the start which has already
been made.

And in answer to the second objection, there will always
be “too many" social functions, lectures, and plays so long
as the college maintains a olicy of giving an education in—
stead of only barren erudl 'on. Accordingly, if a time and
place can‘t be found this semester for a creative production
by the students in which many can find ample opportunity
to express themselves energetically, if not artistically, then
Grinnell had best sell out to the local high school. There is
no time better than the present to broaden the scope of the
opportunities Grinnell affords for creative work.

0 Revised White House.

Heading the latest revolutionary reminder that the White
House belongs to everybody, we inspected it yesterday, and
we approved We decided, in fact, that the weeks of con-
gested bridge—playing in an incommodious basement had been
worth it. We had, as we are inclined to do, accepted the sue
perlatlve dirtiness of OUR recreation center as a necessary
Grinnell institution, and indeed it may be that in a moment
of drowsiness we tossed a coke bottle under the sofa ourv
selves. One could hardly blame us, though. How were we
to know that the sofa would ever be moved?

At any rate, the sofa was moved, and we are glad it hope
pened. We are not in any way responsible, but we are glad
someone is, and we think the Em gency White House com-
mittee deserve a bouquet in addi 'on to the daffodils which
adorned the place yesterday. There were something like
twenty-five people in several thicknesses on the furniture
when we were there, but we were still able to discern that
the Slipcovers were new and clean. With sunlight actually
penetrating the windows and streaming over the murals, and
with the nickelodeon ill the basement muttering ”Big Noise
From Winnetka,” we were indeed under the impression that
people were a little wider awake than usuall We looked
around the room, admired the daffodils a second time, and de»
parted, our mind full of gratitude to the Emergency White
House committee
