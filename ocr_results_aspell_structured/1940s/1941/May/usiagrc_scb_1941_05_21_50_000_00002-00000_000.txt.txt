o Freshman Counselors i

There have been a great many rumors ﬂoat-
ing around the campus this spring about the
new hall to be built east of Dibble this sum-
mer. At the present two things are clear
that it will be finished at least by midffall
if not earlier, and that it will be a freshman
hall. It is this last that is of most interest
to the men of the campus, for this radical
change at once destroys the deep-rooted tra—
dition of prepping, and at least lessens the
intense hall loyalties which have become,
perhaps, too strong, At first glance prob-
ably the majority of men will set up a howl
of protest, but on close obsewation it can
be seen that the plan does have much merit.

First of all, it can be seen that the plan
will result in actllal financial benefit for
Gl'innell in two ways, one being through the

revival of class spirit on and off the cam-
pus. It is a well-known fact that a school
is only as strong as its alumni, but since the
growth of hall spirit, alumni interest upon
graduation has mken a definite slump. In
the long run it is class spirit that holds uS
together after we graduate, that draws us
back to the campus ill the years to céme.
By having the freshmen living together in
their first year, the college will be insuring
continued alumni interest in post-college
days, This alone would make the change
worthwhile, placing funds ill the hands of
the college which are now entirely lost.

It is also true that many freshmen fail
to come back to Grinnell because they did
not make the right start during the year.
Often the men who have the time and in»
clination to “influence” the preps are not
the ones whose influence would do the most
good. By having freshmen under supervis»
ion of expert counselors, many of those who
would otherx 'se drop out because of grades
or other reasons, can he rheled constructive
ly during the year.

This segregation of freshmen will not (I
stroy the hall system as some fear; it ill
merely tone down the loyalties that often
have gone too far. It is true that it may
have an ill effect upon the intramural sys
tem, an effect that cannot yet be determin»
ed. But the intramurals are flexible enough
so that they can stand this change without
losing their present excellent standard. Some
will say that it is the preps who furnish the
pep and enthusiasm, who are the backbone
of the hall teams; so much the better if the
upperclassmen are forced to participate a
little more actively.

And as a last thought, will the college he
fllll of cocky freshmen next year i'tlley are
not under constant uppel'class “supervision"?
To some of the men this will he the most
serious part of the change, a loss of their
most enjoyable sport. It will he the job of
the Council of House Presidents to find a
substitute for their problem. But at least
for the present, it looks as if Grinnell is m-
ing to have a new design for living next
year.

All of these facts were carefully
considered by the administration
and the Council of house presi-
dents before definite action was
taken. “Full consideration for

To the Editor:
The awards have been givenmbut
1 would like to add my own
awal'dsito Alice Meyer and Zepli
Sennitwo grand troupers who
somehow were over-looked Mon»
day night, Can it be the audience
thought they were to choose only
from those men and women ap-
pearing upon the stage that
night? I think so: How else do
you explain the fact that Betty
Ley of Famlbv Portrait received
merely two votes! And Zeph’s per-
formances in both the plays pre—
scnteﬂ this year—forgotten?
I've watched these two. Alice
and Zeph, behind stage. They
deserve,t0 bc called “Troupers.”
When people on the stage muff or
skip s lineithey follow through.
You can count on them to give
the right answers.

\Vith apologies to those two
who gave each a fine perform-
anceiI still insist that had. the
audience understood, as they
would have if the speech before
the plays included the cuiiouncc-
mcnt, that all perfurmanccs of
the year were to be considered7
Alice Meyer as the dizzy wife,
uis sensible Mary and the calm
farm Wifciand Zeph Scim as the
merchant and particularly for the
comical absent-minded father of
George and Murgarcb-would both
have received and deserved die

awards.
