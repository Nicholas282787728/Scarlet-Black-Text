Q The Lindbergh Affair.

A great lnany discussions may be hezlrd
daily regarding Lindbergh’s right to crltl—
c e the policy 0 the United States govern-
ment. But there isn’t any real question re-
garding this ht. It belongs to any citl-
zen, and it is guaranteed by the constitution
of the Ullited States.

Whether ornot criticism of the Lindbergh
type is justi ied during tlle present cl-lsls;
whether or not it is wise, honestly held to
be true by the flyer, or actually damaging
to United States morale and future policy

is more open to discussion.

It seems to be the consensus of well in-
formed men that criticism (constructive in
nature) is always justified. It is obvious
that if Lindbergh’s proposals and arguments
cannot be answered or disproved by respon-
sible, well informed opposition, heed should
be given them. Certainly democracy, repub-
lican government, and “freedom" cannot ex-
ist if opinion is not permitted to be heard,
and then either proved or disproved.

At present, Lindbergh represents a mine
ority opinion. A minority opinion in a crisis
situation is of extreme importance, On the
whole it represents an attempt cooly to anals
yze a situation and to draw logical conclu-
sions.

Lindbergh is well informed on most of
the topics which he discusses, and he is
competent to speak with authority. Many
men of responsibility agree with him ill
part. During the last 10 or 12 years he has
had leisure time in which to study and to
travel extensively. His environment has
been one of exceptional intellectual oppor—
tunity. His personal bravery and integrity
are well established by past deeds.

When consideri g Lindhergh’s assertions,
it should be kept in mind that the ink ,‘ol‘ity
ill any state s3 stem is seldom, if ever, light
—that the majority of people are, and al-
ways will be, comp ativelv ignorant, unable
to observe and criticize loglt lly. The United
States is not an exception

These are troubled tinlcsimomcntous
times. Although it is spring, it is scarcely
appropriate to recite with feeling "Pippa’s
Song." God may be ill his heaven, but all's
not right with the World.

Speak on. Mr. Lindbergh.

To the editor:

If any department in the coir
logo has reason to object to the
spring commcncemcnt program, I
believe that the department of
drama has the strongest.

Because, for some reason, the
original plays have been sched—
uled for Friday, June 5, when
hardly any parents or alumni will
be here to witness them.

Surely originnl plays written
by students dcscrve thc maximum
attendance. Parents and alums are
and always will be interested in
stage productions. Why deprive
them of the chance to see what
Grinnellians are doing?

Why not arrange to have the
plays on Saturday. as in former
years, following the Glee Club
concert? Certainly this is possi-
ble. Why ignore a department
that has for years maintained a
high standard in studentrwl'itten
work?
