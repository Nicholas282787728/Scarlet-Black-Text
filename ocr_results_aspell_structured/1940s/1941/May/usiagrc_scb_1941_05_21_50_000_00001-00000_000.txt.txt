Stevens Explains Langan Action; Hall Members Express

Langan Hall will be closed

classmen are concerned, Pres.
Samuel N. Stevens stated to-
day. According to Stevens, this
decision was made last week in a
joint meeting of the Council of
house presidents. Shelton L. Beat-
ty, dean of men, and the presi-
dent himself.
“There are many

said, "but the main ones could
be summed up this way: a care-
ful study of the physical Set—up of
our men’s houses by the architec-

Langan Hall. because of its size
and because of other considera-
tions would lend itself more ef<
fectively to use as a freshman
center; social adjustments which
would be involved also could be
more effectively made in Langan
than in the other halls."

Stresses Point.

Stevens stressed the point that
it was not because of any weak—
ness in hall spirit or any trouble
within the hall alone that was the
cause of the decision, but that (his

other ram necessitated the dis-
bandment.

“The question may arise, ‘Why
does any hall have to be closed‘?"

Is Seen As Answer

A new plan for Social activi-

advanced by Kenet Pearce,
president of the Coullcil of
House Presidents, at a meeting of
the student council held Tuesday
night.

The plan, a result of Pearce's
investigations at Carleton College,
was worked out by a committee
composed of James Miles, Clark
junior; Jane Goplerud, Heines jun-
ior, and Marjorie Vincent. James

The new set-up calls for more
diversified social activities, which
will include outside dances on port-
able dancc floors, picnics. hayrides,
roller and ice skating, etc.

“The plan is aimed toward ldrg.

dent body and will appeal to those
who date and others who do not

of the council, said yestc

in this light too. it is impossible

The Council of House Presidents
met last week.

It was a busy meeting. History
was being made. Also, the books
wouldn't balance.

For an institution of its size,
Gi-innell just doesn’t have enough
revenue. Even With the $50 [LIP
tion boost next year, ends won't
meet. The dorms are crumbling
slowly like a castle in the sand.

The tablecloths are wearing
out. They are getting holy. It’s
not in keeping with the dorms.

"Please," said Mr. Pearce, “be
careful of the tablecloths. boys.
They're the only ones we’ve got.
Please, boys, this is important,"

‘No Jade Shall Burn’ Takes Steiner Playwriting A ward

One-Act Play by
Barrett'Depicts The
Awakening of China

By Henry Alden.
Last night the department of
drama presented three of the four
original one-act plays written this
year in competition for the
Henry York Steiner Memorial
Prize in Playwriting, and the
prize was award to Arthur Bar-
rett’S play. ”No Jade ShollBurn "
In a prcfatory talk before the
performance Mrs. Pryor made a
plea for creative work in drama,
and last night's productions were
in themsclvcs eloquent testimony
of the high quality of the many
kinds of creative imagination that

combine in the annual produc<
tion of thenriginal plays at Grin-
neli.

Production Praised.

it is regrettable that there is
no space to reproduce here from
the printed program the long list
of students responsible for the
various parts of the performance,
for in our natural emphasis on
author and actor, we are likely to
forget the importance of design,
direction, and other items of pro-
duction.

Notable in two of the plays is
the way in which our young
playwrights have taken contem-
perm-y subject matter and given
it artistic form. Grant Marshall's
“This is Our Land” presents
sympathetically the plight of

lowa farmers driven off their land
by the government’s plan for
munition plants and ends with a
plea for the subordination of
individual needs to the need of
the nation.

Cites Poor Climax.

After a good beginning the play
failed somehow to rise to a satis-
factory ciimax that was the in-
evitable outgrowth of the situa-
tion. This weakness was par i—
cularly evident in contrast With
the next play on the program,

“No Jade Shall Burn."
