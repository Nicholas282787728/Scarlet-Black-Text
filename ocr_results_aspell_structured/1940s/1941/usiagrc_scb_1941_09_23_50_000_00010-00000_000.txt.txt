Enrollment--

Continued from page i

me New Gi-inncll education plan,
Stevens said the freshmen were
of slightly better quality than the
class or last fall. This opinion was
based on the high school records
of the new students, and on the
proficiency examinations which
thcy have taken.

“The 1945 class contains an un.
usually large niinibcr of gifted
students," the president said. He
explained that many of the new
students had brilliant high school
records, and were outstanding in
their performance in the fresh-
man exams.

”All freshmen admitted who
were not in the upper hall of
their class, have been allowed to
register on a basis of tests which
have shown their mental ability
to do college work," Stevens
said.

The actual enrollment figures
will also be effected by the n'uJYP
ber of transfer students enter»
ing Grinncll this fall. The actual
number of transfers is still un—
known, but “there are not so
many as we would like to have
had,” the president stated.

Varsity Managerships Open:
Training Clinic to Be Held

Any sophomore men interested in
varsity managerships are asked
to report to Athletic Director G.
Lester Duke as soon as possible

Any male student interested in
a student trainer’s job is also
asked to report. Duke plans to
introduce o trainer’s clinic with
Bill Frey, former Iowa university
