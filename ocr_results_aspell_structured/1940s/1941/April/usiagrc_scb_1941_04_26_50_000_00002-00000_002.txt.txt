UMMONED by Harvard's Phillips Brooks House
Association, delegates from eleven large eastern
colleges recently attended a twosday community

service conference, laid the groundwork for a nation—wide
collegiate organixation to study and handle community
social service problems. Since every college invited was
already engaged to some degree in social service work,
emphasis was placed upon new ideas and approaches ~
ideas which the sponsors of the conference feel will be of
wide—spread interest to other colleges.

Speakers and discussion leaders pointed out that com-
munity service, if properly organized and administered,
can be “an excellent bridge over which American ideals
and democratic understanding can pass to the youth of too
day". Purpose of the conference, and of the projected na-
tional organization, is to awaken collegians to the fact that
they must be instrumental in building and maintaining that
bridge.

 

The Phillips Brooks House Association constitutes the

largest extra—curicular activity at Harvard, and annually

engages more than 400 men in various forms of social ser—

vice work ranging from settlement house work to graduate
