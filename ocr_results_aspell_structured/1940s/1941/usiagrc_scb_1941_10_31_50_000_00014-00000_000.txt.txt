Rating Board
Outlines New
Preps Rules’

New freshman regulations have

been issued by the prep rating
board of the student council, ac-
cording to Hartwell Davis, chair-
man.

With 25 points awarded for re-
cent prep activities, the freshmen
now have 110 credits toward the
1,000 required tor permanent re-
moval of prep caps.

Under the new regulations the
caps will be temporarily removed
after the satisfactory completion
of prep week, Nov. 8 to 15. Prep
duties will continue during the
winter, however, Davis said. If
the 1,000 point goal has not been
reached by March 1, freshmen will
be required to wear caps again
until the end of the second semes-
ter, or until 1,000 points are ac-
cumulated.

Group singing at the first Grin-
nell home game netted the fresh»
men 15 points. According to Da-
vis, the group as a whole knew
the songs, but individuals were
unprepared.

Decorations by the class for the
prosperity party of the Gadabout
club were considered “excellent,"
Davis said; but since all the work
was done by a few class members
only, 10 points were awarded,
