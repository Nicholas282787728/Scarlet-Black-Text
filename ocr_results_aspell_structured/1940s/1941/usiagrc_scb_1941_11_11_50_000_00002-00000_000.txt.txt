cecal Show

V‘Htr ploject undertaken by G1innel1 stu-

dents is dying a sloW death

For two yeals we have been hearing
about the musical show, ”Slightly Nautical.”
A club, the Derelict club, was formed to
present such 21 show each year. Music was
composed, script written, directors chosen,
cast selected, and the dates for the pro—
duction was set at December 10 and 11.

Now it appears that the show is on
its way to extinction unless something is
done quickly to revive it.

Grinnell has the talent to present such

To the editor:
Writing about campus honesty is
a ticklish thing, we know, but
events of the past would seem to
justity it. We started out believ-
ing that every Grinnell student
was fundamentally honest, but
now we are frankly skeptical.
Gadabout memberships are non-
trensferable, and every student
who stops to consider can see the
reason for such a regulation.
However, students have been pass—
ing memberships around ivith im-
punity. No doubt they think that
they are putting somcthiug over
on us. They aren't, We aren’t
that stupid.

Preliminary reports from the Reg-
istrar’s office indicate that, in the
ma‘ midrsemester grades will be
no better or no worse than in
the past.

If such be true, then the fears
of both faculty and students, that
scholastic work has not been up
to par, can be filed away along
with the cynics who believed that
the dormitory and gymnasium
would never, be built.

Probably one of the reasons
for the belief that work would
be of poorer quality was the
general understanding that
o innell would become a
“tougher" school this year.

We don’t dispute that Grinncll
courses may call for more work
than before and the faculty is
cracking the whip over the stu—

dent body. But, at the same
timc, one of the chlef advantages
in the four hour system as insti-
tutetl here is the abolition of
many of the two hour courses
which cluttcrcd up a student's
schedule. Now students carry lcss
courses but put more time into
class preparation.

Both students and iaoulty
alike expected the revised cur
riculurn to increase their burr
