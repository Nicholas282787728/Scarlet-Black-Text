Planned Un’ril

Peace Time
By Allen Arney

The building program of the col-
lege will not be affected in any
way by the war situation, Pres.
Samuel N. Stevens, stated today.

However, all plans for future
additional building will be sus-
pended ‘Ior the duration of the
war, he added.

L. v. Phelps, college treasurer,
and purchasing agent, pointed out
that all general building contracts
have been let and that the con-
tractors themselves have to pur-
chase the steel and other pro-
ducts.

“If you can find somebody who
has the desired material in stock
there is no question about priori-
ties,” Phelps stated.

If at any time the contractors
can't locate a wholesaler with
materials, it is up to us to go
out and try to find one, he said

The only things affected at
present are minor metal parts.
and chromium metals, Phelps com
tinued, “and we will have to ad-
just for them in some way."

The plumbing fixtures, conduit
and wires for the gym are on the
campus now. There has been no
trouble in getting brick, cement
or concrete, he said.

The only information received
by the college concerning the
priority ruling came from J. W.
Studebaker, U. 5. Commissioner
of education, Washington, D. C.
This information concerned the
right of an educational institution
(includina vocational training) to

order equipment of any kind nec»
essary to continue maintainance
and repair materials, in line with
the recently expressed policy of
the Supply Priorities and Allocr-
tions board of keeping the “econ-
amy" in good ninning order.

The priority rating is call co
A—10 and was released October 16.
1941. It has been granted to lion-
dreds of thousands of the nation’s
industrial plants.

“Even this rating is at a low
ebb,” Phelps said.

Herschel M. Colbert, head of
radio publicity, who has been buy-
ing many materials for the radio
studio, said that in an order for
materials it has to be proven that
the needed materials are for the
purpose indicated in the Tatillgi
If government investigation found
a falsely fillcd order heavy puni-
tive measures would be imposed,

he declared.
