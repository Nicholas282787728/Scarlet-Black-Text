Baumann Claims
11 Month Class
Year Is Coming

“Within ten years, college stur
dents will be attending classes
111/2 months out of the year,"
predicted Frederick L. Baiimann,
associate professor of history,
yesterday.

Upon further questioning he
stated that it is foolish havi g
buildings stand idle for three
months when they could be put
to much needed use. He believes
that professors today have ac-
quired only onerhalf the learning
necessary and that the intro—
duction of summer school courses
to many schools is the beginning
of a 12 month school year for the
benefit of both faculty and stud-
dents.

Originally, the three months
vacation was for the benefit of
farm labor, according to the his
tory professor. Tlic privilege has
been abused till it is used for
loafing purposcs only, he con-
tends.

"Oxford students are granted a
five month's vocation." he points
ed out, “but during that time they
must work on assignments to be
turned in the first day classes are
resumed. They also use their var
cation period for extensive educa-
tional Lmvel”

The move to cancel Sunday
night supper found great favor
among- Grinnell's rcstauranteurs.
who generally believe the move at
least will double Sunday cvening
business.
