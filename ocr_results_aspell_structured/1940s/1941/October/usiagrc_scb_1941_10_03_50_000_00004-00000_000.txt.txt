cliff McCain and Phil South-

spotting the receivers

and I’ll give you .back 15 seconds

Says PAUL DOUGLAS,

well-known radio announcer

Somebody whistles a few bars of a catchy tune.
Others pick it up.
Soon the whole country’s whistling it. It’s a hit.

Somebody lights up a cigarette.
Likes it. Passes the word along.
Soon the whole country’s smoking it.
It’s a hit. IT’S CHESTERFIELD.

The big thing'that’s pushing Chesterﬁeld ahead,

Is the approval of smokers like yourself. .

Chesterﬁelds are deﬁnitely Milder,
Cooler-Smoking and Better-Tasting.

They 're made oft/19 world 's best cigarette tobacco:

Blended just right to give you more smaking pleasure.

cipyrnlu lgal, Licom a limo Tunccn Col

But even these facts wouldn’t count

If smokers didn’t just naturally like them.

Once a smoker ﬁnds out from Chesterﬁeld

What real smoking pleasure ls, nothing else will do,

Everywhere you 90
