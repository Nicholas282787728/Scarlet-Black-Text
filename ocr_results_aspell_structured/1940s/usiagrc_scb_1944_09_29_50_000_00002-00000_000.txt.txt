"Oh. Joe! Joe's With a Girl"

The seniors know what it means, and so
do most of the juniors. But the class of
‘47 and the class of ’48 do not realize that
a date for a Friday night basketball game
was once strictly "snafu” in Grinnell.
Basketball games were not for dates; they
were for crowds. This was one of many
such traditions, little things which made
Grinnell individualistic, gave the schnal its
own characteristic atmosphere, and kept our
college from being just another name on
the accredited list.

There were regular family-style meals
then. Student waiters served each course,
and being the head of a table meant some-
thing more than ”Will you start the salad,
please?“ Those were the days of no Sat<
urday classes, special quad hours for the
men, and really heavy prepping. Who can
remember when the only person allowed to
smoke in the dining room~and he only on
festive occasions— was Doctor Stevens?

Of course, many of these practices have
been completely dropped because we no
longer have the facilities (male) nor the
students (male) to maintain them. Others
would have become obsolete even in noirnal
years But there are fragments of the old
Grinnell which we can, if we wish, piece
together for another year or more. The
men’s halls‘ songs need not be forgotten.
All of us discovered last week that the
Dibble sweetheart song can mean a great
deal, although the Dibble Eagle has not
ﬂown for two years. The fellas loved sere-
nades, Anyone who knew 3. Gates’ hall
crooner will agree Well, we can sing too.
It will not be quite the same, but the sore
nade is too fine a tradition to relinquish.
We can serenade the quad, the faculty, and
the Select Few across the street.

We can remember that our drawing
room piano was given with the request that
nothing but classical music be played upon

 

 

 

it. Until the spring of 1942 nothing ever
was. We can keep Spring Day the most
completely carefree day of the year. We
can support chapel and college church so
that their high ideals will be maintained,
while some of their staunchest backers are
cleaning rifles. There are more traditions,
too, which will be recalled during the com—
ing year, We are the ones who can preserve
them They meant a lot, a few years ago,
to Harpo, and Carl, and Art Brodyl What
do they mean to us?

"In a Song +0 'H'le Siaunch" - -

We, the freshmen, are told “Button, prep!”
and “Get off the grass 1" whenever an up
perclassman walks by We must learn and
sing all verses of the three main Grinnell
songs We must polish shoes, pour water
at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We must
walk on the sidewalks, and do other em-
barrassing and humble duties for our hon,
ored upperclassmcn.

But“ WHY ? Why are we freshmen who,

are just getting started into a new way
of life and trying to adjust ourselves sub-
jected to such treatment? Is it because we
must be shown our ignorance, that we must
show respect for the upperclassmen? What
really is the purpose of prepping?

Prepping is an institution as old as
Grinnell itself. It is a part of any college
life, and a. lot of fun for both the preppers
and the victims. It can be an experience
you will remember longer than anything
else about college. You will look back upon
the foolish things you did during “hell
week" and remember some of the best times
you ever had.

Until the recent war years and the lack
of men, prepping was run by the Honor “G".
It was tough then—especially for the boys,
Now, however, the house governments have
taken over the program and are continuing
it in an effort to keep alive one of. Grinnell’s
best traditions.

The realistic results of prepping, though,
are the effect it has on the individual and
on the class. The little red caps which dot
the campus and classrooms, indicate to ev-
eryone, including the freshmen, who the
members of the new class are. It draws
the individuals of the class together, if only
in sympathy for each other of their plight.
plight.

For the individual it has an even greater
value. It teaches tolerance and obedience,
and removes the impression most high
school seniors have of themselves. We will
get to realize we are not the big fish we
were in high school, but are starting all
over again in an institution of higher learn-
ing . . . and we certainly have a lot to learn.

But when it's all over, and we rise at a
football, or basketball game to sing the
school song we learned so well by memory,
we will sing with pride, “Sons of Old Grin-
nell, let your voices swell, in a song to the
staunch, the true . . . ” We will be true
Grinnellians.
