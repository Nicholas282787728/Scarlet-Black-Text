O “Mlnor Sports”

A well-rounded editorial policy must per»
force take cognizance of sports activities at
Grinnell, especially when a situation arises
that seems to call for special attention. Just
such an occasion has arisen this splillg
when the question of placing tennis and golf
on a major sport basis has come up for
consideration.

It is a well-known fact to those who know
that the tennis and golf teams at Grinnell
have not received the apropriate amount of
attention or recognition the last few years.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

For instance, last year the golf team had
the best competitive record of any Gl‘innell
team, winning over seventyrfive percent of
their matches. And yet who could have told
you that unless a member of the golf team
itself“.7 This year both tennis and golf
teams have made outstanding records, the
former reigning as conference champs, and
tlle latterln‘inging home runner-up honor

This should be enough to establish the en—
cellence of Grinllell teams in these sports.

Why is it, then, that tennis and golf have
not been rated major sports at Grinnell in
the past? This is a difficult question to
answer in view of the hours upon hours of
painstaking practice required to win the
skill necessary to triumph in collegiate com’
petition. Perhaps an explanation can be
found ill the long antiquated viewpoint that
these sports are “sissy" games, not desel‘V'
ing the prestige which an Honor ‘G‘ carries.

This spring a step in the right direction
has been taken to place these sports upon
the major basis which they undoubtedly den
serve. Motivated by the fact that tennis
and golf possess a cal ~over value after
school far exceeding that of football and
basketball, and by the fact that every con-
ference school considers these sports of
major importance, our athletic director has
attempted to promote tennis and golf to a
full major sport basis. However, the ath-
letic committee has been hesitant to act on
this suggestion and has made no decision
in the matter as yet. This we believe to be
unfortunate.

Students, here is an opportunity for pub-
lic opinion to come into its own. The cause
is just, the demand is pressing. And al-
though the sllbject may not seem of ex»
ceedingly grave impoltance, it is our sin-
cere wish to see justice done to our su-
perior tennis and golf teams.

 

Around
The Campus

With
BILL 5110an

An innovation in campus employ-
ment will be reached next year
when student workers are paid on
n straight salaried basis, instead
of on an hourly rate, us has been
the custom in the past.

The action was brought about
by Phylis Ml Tod, director of em-
ployment, who felt that discrimi-
nation was being shown when a
fast, efﬁcient worker, doing a
loli hour job in less than the
dilated time was forced to find
cxtm work, while a student, not
quite in enterprising, could easily
pad his time sheet.

An analysis has been made of
all campus employment for the
purpose of determining just hbw
much time each particular job
should take. Instead of all work
calling for either my; or 21 hours,
those jobs, calling for less time,
will be paid accordingly, and the
same is tmc for work demanding
more time.

in dctcnninlng the time needed
foi- cvcry job, an cfficicncy expert
was to have been called in to dc—
tcrmiuc the amount of time every
job should take. However, no
action has been taken along that
line as yet. It is felt that the new
system will not much maximmr;
cffcctivcncss until the efﬁciency
expert has checked over require-
ments of jobs, types of equipment
used, working conditions, and all
the other factors which must be
taken into conslderauon.

Robert Stewart, Gates junior
and newly-nsmcd president of
Friars, was credited by Miss Tod
for gaining the information for
the analysis. Stewart contacted
almost every supervisor of a. stu—
dent employee to gain the neces-
sary data.

Another innovation next year

will be that no student, once he
begins work during s semester,
will be changed from his job. This
semester, 16 students, because of
podi- gram, were forced to quit
their cmpluyment.

Scholastic standards for student
employees will not change. A 1.5
grade point average will be re-
quired cf every man and women
employed. There will be no Ex-
captions to this ruling, according
to Miss Tod. When school opens
in September, nc freshman student
will be allowed to work, while
senior employees will automatical-
ly be dismissed second semester.

College Journalists
Are Also Students—-
No Paper Till June 8

College journalists are also
college students, and college
students must study,

Inasmuch as the staff of the
Scarlet and Black like to con<
sidez‘ themselves college stu-
dents, it has been discovered
that the wisest course of action
is to Study for final examine.-

In other words, the Scarlet
and Black will not publish
again until June 8, when a
special commencement issue
will reach the public.

To the Editor:

Just what kind of skull-duggcry
is going on in thc business end
of the 1941 Cyclone?

According to the practice of
the past few years, the Cyclone
has collected two dollars in cash
from students desiring a year-
book, with the understanding that
another two dollars should be
taken from each students room
deposit. Now, however, the col-
lege treasurer has refused to re
lease the twn dollars from the
room deposits of Lhose students
who have less than five dollars
in their account or who owe the
college money. Hence, the Cyclone
demands from these students an<
other two dollars in cash.

All well and good. But there
are some students who, in View
of this last-minute renigdng on
the past of the treasurers office,
dcsirc to cancel their Cyclone
subscription and ask im- a i-cfuud
of the two dousss they have
previousky paid in cash.

This refund the business man—
ager of the Cyclonc refuses to
grant, arguing that by paying two
dollars the student contracted for
a year-hook and can not now
back out. But surely the student
has as much right to cancel his
end of the deal as the Cyclone
snd treasurer‘s office have to
modify their obligations at the
last moment!

Mei-mom, reliable informa—
tion from the business staff of
the Cyclone itself is that all
books ordered and nut redeemed
by a. second cash payment will
be sold to the Public Relations
Department for two dollars. Thus,
the Cyclone ends up foul- dollnns
ahead. but the student loses two
bucks in cold cash!
it is not the students fault the
treasurer‘s office clamped down
on already thin wallets. Why
should students be penalized for
the administration's last-minute
change in policy? What right has
thc Cyclone to take two dollars
from is student and give him
nothing in return? PLAIN, 01ml.
NAlty HONESTY DEMANDS

To the Editor:
We are sorry that the unspoken
rule about crashing a houseparty
before intermission has been
broken by a few unsceing preps
and negligent upperclassmen.
We’re proud that you like our
parties and want to come, but it
spoils the atmosphere to have
plain-clothes men dotting the
crowd A gatekeeper would be an
unpleasant innovation, so we'll see
you after intermission!
