This Is Our Job

The students who were in Herrick chapel
yetserday morning got a hard blow on the
chin. They heard Dr. Burkhart tell them
the amazing fact that college youth, the
intellectual leaders of the future, are ignor-
ant ofiand indifferent to—the affairs of
the world, He said we were in a safe little
retreat here at college and had no curiosity
about what was going on outside of our
restricted sphere. Talk about complacency!
We’re the perfect symbols of it, Dr. Burk-
hart inferred. i,

He gave us a jolt, and when the speech
was over, we didn’t know what to say.
Somebody tossed the issue off with, “Well,
let’s close school and join the army or the
WAACS." A speech student dismissed Dr.
Burkhart‘s address because he found the
gestures distracting.

As for the majority who admit that Dr.
Burkllart is right, they too are far from
satisfied. They reason this way: “All right,
so we are too indifferent even to read :1

more effective than what They do or say is

Just a Few Complaints

We include this list of small complaints from
Grinnell students because we believe that it
can serve a college institution constructively.

We realize fully that conditions of war—
time necessarily impair the smooth funcA
tioning of institutional maintenance. At the
same time we believe that curable incon—
veniences should be brough to light and
remedied as soon as conditions warrant.

1. There is now a most discomfor'lg
lack of drinking fountains and rest room
facilities on campus.

2. It is the general concensus that bread
consumption will not increase but that un-
necessary work for waiters will decrease
if bread is served in whole slices instead of
in half slices.

3. Those who know—the men on the
campusideclare that the showerroom
plumbing in the new gymnasium is not all
that it should be,

4. And quad residents would deeply ape
preciate the addition of soap dishes in the
showers there.

Army History—

WAAC Ll'. Lectures To Soldiers

Take heart, girls. Florence Night-
ingale wasn't the only one to
prove there is a place for women
in the army, There is, for in-
stance, Lt. Jane Mauerhum, for-
merly of San Francisco, now with
the public relations office of
WAAC headquarters in Des
Moincs.

Yesterday, for the first time in
United states ,Army history, a
member of the women's auxiliary
army corps got up and lectured
to the personnel of an officer
candidate school. And they cook
it. Moreover, they saluted. She
got all the benefits and privi-
leg-es of her silver bars, including
a private army car from Des
Moines.

Organization and functioning
of the auxiliary corps will play
an important part in the work
of some of these officers-to-be
into actual
army administration work, for
members of the auxiliary will be
assigned to many of the army
posts in this country.

Most officer candidate schools
will Ilse one of their own instruc~
tors for explanation of the sum;-
iary Work. But With Grinnell so
strategically located, an active
member of the WAAC was given
the assignment.

Otter Firsl'
Aid Courses

Several Red Cross
Classes Given For

Women First Sem
Anyone interested in taking dif~
fenent types of Red Cross courses
this Year, shochl let their intrae
mural chairman know, Margaret
Carey, president of w. R. A. on—
llounced today. ,

First Aid class is already in
progress. This course will last
throughout the semester and
meets on Tuesday nights, HowA
ever, other courses shall be given
depending on the girl’s interests,
Such subjects as Canteen and
home nursing are already being
considered by Miss Carey.

Those who cannot come to the
First Aid class at 7:30 on Tues-
day nights, should specify a more
suitable time when they hand in
their names to the intramural
chairman of their cottage. It is
possible that a course in First
Aid might be held on Saturday
afternoons if enough girls sign
up for this period.

The course in nutrition is not
being given this year, because
. iss Carey feels that it is a repe-
tition of the hygiene and orienta-
tion courses that women students
are required to Lake in their
freshmen years. Instead, the can-
tecn course will be given, if
enough sign up, and it is felt
that this course, while more ea-
venccd will not be too difficult
and far more interesting than the
basic nutrition course, Miss Carey
said.
