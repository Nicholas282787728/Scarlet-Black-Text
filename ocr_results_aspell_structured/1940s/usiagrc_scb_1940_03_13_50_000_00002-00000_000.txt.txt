TWO ISSUES TO GO

Saturday morning the Grinnell college
board of publications will name a new edi»
tor of the Scarlet and Black, and with the
appointment comes a new deal for 1300
readers.

Looking back over 50 issues, the present
administration finds that as it has no tan-
gible assets to turn over to its successor;
a few lines of philosophic observation must
suffice. We will define a fliend of the
college journalist. ,

A. A friend is a person who wants a
story in the paper.

B. A c'itic, or the guy who “isn’t
speaking," is:
a. The fellow

print,

b. The fellow whose story was printed,
but cut from 500 words to 50.

c. The fellow whose story wasn’t printed
correctly, either because he gave it to the
reporter wrong; the reporter handed it to
the desk rong; the I‘val‘ite mall re-wrote
it wrong; it was given to the linotype op—
erator wrong; the operator set it wrong; or
the proof reader didn’t catch it.

d. The fellow who has a story but who is
scared that you will print it.

e, The fellow who has had a story for
three weeks: releases it after it is “stale;”
and gets no results. .

f. The fellow whose story rates pages 2,
3, 4, etc.

g. The fellow who doesn’t agree with a
columnist.

h. The fellow who doesn‘t agree with the
editorials. ‘

i. The fellow who gets knocked in Doric.

j. The fellow who doesn‘t get mentioned
in Doric,

k. The faculty member who thinks that a
college paper should be for the edification

whose story you didn’t

of students.

1. The “student" who believes that a cola
lege paper should be for the entertainment
of “collegians.”

m. The fellow you tell the truth about.

n. The fellow you don‘t tell the truth
about.

0. The girl whose picture didn’t do her
justice.

p. The department that

(1. A student leader,

1'. The fellow who wants to be a student
leader but isn’t getting his publicity.

s. The fellow who didn’t get his
paper.

t. The fellow who got his last paper and
is sorry he did.

u. The fellow you bothered to verify a
story.

v. The fellow you didn‘t bother to bother
to verify a story.

w. The English prof whose colleague
passed the editors in freshman English.

x. The bachelor faculty member you‘ve
given a wife, or the faculty ”Miss" who has
received a husband.

y. The rest of them, too numerous to
mention.

2. The fellow who told you you should
have had enough sense to go steady if you
wanted an cxtra-cul icular activity, and not
to get connected with those $1/’&*”§ jour-
nalists.

FACULTY AND STUDENTS

One of the distinctive advantages which a
small liberal arts school holds over the uni-
versity is the more intimate relationship
which exists between teacher and student,
both within and outside the classroom Not
only does this relationship afford the stu—
dent a clearer grasp of the material through
questioning and discussion, but also affords
the instructor an opportunity to grade not
alone on examinations but on the student’s
combined efforts in the classroom and in the
written exam, We believe that Grinnell ex-
cels in this respect.

However, the situation in Grinnell is not
ideal. We should be presumptuous to say
that it is. One of the criticisms which has
reached our cars has to do fundamentally
with this instructolustudent relationship
from the first classloom discussion to the
grading of the student’s filial exam. This
criticism, boldly, is as follows—that the in—
structor has a tendency to present the ma-
terial with his own special interpretation
and to look upon a different student inter-
pretation with a degree of intolerance. This
intolerance may be in the form of a refusal
to discuss the matter further ill class, or,
more seriously, in the form of a tendency to
lower the student’s grade in examinations.

We realize the danger in making gener-
alities such as the one above. We realize
also that the instructor may have valid rea
sons for his conduct, that the instructor
with many facts to present cannot permit
lnuch time—consuming argument, or that the
professor senses in the student's intcrprcr
tation inconsistencies with the facts pre-
sented. Yet the fact remains that many stun
dents feel resentful that their opinions are
not more calefully weighed by their instrucr
tors. May they not expect a more reason-
able and courteous hearing for their opin-
ions“.7
