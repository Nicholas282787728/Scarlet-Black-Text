Miles Says Funciion
Will Be A Dance Bui
Refuses lo Tell More

The big question mark of the
semester, the Gadabouts program
for next Saturday night, will be
answered on schedule, James
Miles, Gadabouts chairman, said
today,

hints as to what might be in
store for the student body, Miles
said that the program would
fundamentally be chance," with
Bill Meardon and his orchestra
furnishing die music.

As to the novelty involved,
Miles shut up like a badly~scared
clam, except to admit it would
be tied in with the war effort.

"It will be what President
Roosevelt indicated in his talk
he would like to have us do,” he
said,
