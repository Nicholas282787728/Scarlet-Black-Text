Camera Ar

The excellent prints at left and below are two oi the many unusual photo-
graphs which deserve special mention. An infra red lilter was used to pr‘o-
duee the striking picture at Ieit, while the photo below required an eight-
minute exposure with only the moon for light.

Greatest thrill (or the camera artist comes when developing photos ol
this kind — where skill, imagination and equipment combine to create
the unusual.
