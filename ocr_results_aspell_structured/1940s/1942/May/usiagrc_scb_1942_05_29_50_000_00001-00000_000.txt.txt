In I918 Graduaiion— ‘

No School Year Sp heec‘lmup During Lasi' War

Despite the fact [hat we were
at War with Germany in
1918, graduation exercises
were held only one day earl»
icr than they would have been
otherwise Ninety seniors were
graduated. 12 of whom were in
the armed services and received
their diplomas by mail

Enlisting seniors were given de-
grees if they hail completed 112
hours of studies (eight hours less
that the present rcoiiirsment.)

Commencement Week in 1915
began June 7 and lasted till June
11. The Scarlet and Black for
April 10. 1918 said, "Because of
the war, graduation exercises will
be shortened by one day, come
incnccment being held on Tuesday
instead of on Wednesday as in
the past,"

The grallusi n class was some-
u-lnit doplotcd because oi the
large numbers or men who had
leit tor the armed forces. the
Scarlet nnd Bloch said

No ciiort was made in 1917 to
shorten the school your by even
one day, The Scarlet nnd Block
for M. a, 1917 pointed out, “We
shall ilzwe school till the end of
tlic yccr Everything \Vlll go on
as usual."

Then, as now, students were one
vised to "keep their heads" and

to remain in school as long as
possible. A college dogroc would
be worth a lot when the War was
over, they were told. President
Main told the student body,
“Don't. be nasty.”

Despite that fact a good many
students left Grinnell to enlist
too early to have completed the
number of credits required for
graduation. If the was hadn’t
endcd when it did, all past evi-
dence points to the fact that
Grinnell might have turned into

what was virtually a girls’ school.
In the fall of 1918 only a few
men were back on campus, accords
ing to Scarlet and Black’s of that
year.

Yet Griimcll mode only a very
minor effort to accelerate in
1913 sud none at all in 1917, De-
spite the fact that men were leavA
iiig almost every day for the
armed forces, Grinnell still had a
spring vacation, and the gradua-
tion program was shortened by
only one day.
