Goding Defends Tiile
As Coe Seeks Fourth

Consecutive Diadem

Fifteen Gl‘il‘ll‘lcll tl‘acksbei's
left this morning for Moll-

Midwest conference track and
field meet there tomorrow. Only
Pionccr to defend a title will be

According to records so far
this season and to advance prc-
dictions, the caliber of this
year's meet should be higher than
usual. Coe, champion for the last
threc years, is expected to 1‘3-
peat, though Grinnell, Cornell, or
Boloit may come through,

Cite Cluttcrham.

Dave clutterhani, Cornell’s
sophomore miler, ran a 4:242
mile at the Beloit relays last
weekend and Will probably at
least equal that mark Saturday.
He will he pushed by coding and
Bill Davis of Goo. clutherham is
also the two mile favorite with
Ken Shoulberg of Grinnell the
probable runner-up. Coding is
capable of 1:59 half mile and
should take that event without
difficulty unless last year’s
champion, Rankin of Monmouth,
pulls an upset. Tod Kennefick of
Griiincll will also compete in the
half mile.

Dick Raddant of Beloit may
annex his third straight 100 yard
dash and broad Jump titles, but
he'll have strong competition in
the cenutly from Pioneer Cap-
tain Ross .Nofaro, Houden of Cor-
nell, and Harry Waters of Grin-
nell. Houden is expected to re-
tain his 220 yard dash title.
Favor One Runner.

John Altflllish, who anchors
Coe’s favored mile relay team,
will be after his third quarter mile
title. Grinnellians Pat Patterson,
Curly Bisho‘p, or Bill Findley may
also compete in this event. Last
year's high and low hurdle
champions, Jim Fiewegcr of Laws
fence and Summer of Goa, are

Pioneers Favored
To Win Conference

Tennis Meel Saturday

With two wins and a loss behind
them, four Grinnell net men will
enter the conference tennis meet
at Monmouth, Ill., tomorrow,
Coach Ben Douglas said yestel‘r
day, The team left with thc track
squad this morning.

Douglas did not indicate which
men will play in the doubles and
which in the singles matches.
However, conference singles cham-
pion Sterling Lord probably will
team with Ralph Hart in the
doubles rather than go in defense
of his singles title.

Lord and Hart are the top-
seeded doubles team of the Mis-
souri Valley.

Other members of the tennis
team are Carl Georg-e and Ed
Gilbert. All except Hart, who is
a sgpllomol'c, are lettermen. Last
year's team had for the confer-
once championship, and this year’s
team is favored to annex the
title,

returning but must give the fav-
orite spot to a sophomore, Bill
Laxon of Monmouth, Gl‘lnnell's
Bob Cori-igan is rated near the
top in the high hurdle event;
another Pioneer, Bob neither will
also enter this event.

Grinnell's weakness lies partic~
ularly in the weight events since
the loss of Jerry Grant. Never
the less, Jae Briggeman's show-
ing in the discus last weekend
ranks him among the top con-
fer-once men in his speciality.
Lefty Sory is conceded a place
in both the broad jump and the
javclin.

Dean Newcll of the Pioneers is
one of the conference's better
high jumpers, and the same may
be said of Don Hock and Ed
Nagel in the pole vault.

department would continue to
function as a department next
year with one course—play pro—
duction-being offered. He also
stated that advanced students
would be allowed to present some
of their own work.

"We will have the funds on
hand next year to present two
productionsAone in the fall and
one in the spring,” he said.

After that‘time, Stevens hoped
that the department would of~
fer a full selection of courses,
provided that the war did not inc
terfere.

1n commenting on the work
done by Mrs. Pryor, the president
said that she had earned an envi—
able reputation from her prcdllc-
tions of original one-act plays,
and as a director has kept a very
high professional standard,

”More creative work produced
here has been published than from
any other college in Iowa," he
said.

"In spite of the lack of a fine
arts building and adequate stage
facilities, productions have been of
such high order that scarcely a
year has gone by that pictures of
settings, and articles concerning
plays produced here have not ap-
peared in theatrical magazines,"
Steven’s pointed out.

an 8-1 victory of Langan Thurs-

solid string of wins.

Striking out seven men and

well backed up by the field, Ha-

first half of the seventh.

Mann also made Langan's only

made first on an error, and scored
on a fielder-s choice which put
Bailey out at first.
