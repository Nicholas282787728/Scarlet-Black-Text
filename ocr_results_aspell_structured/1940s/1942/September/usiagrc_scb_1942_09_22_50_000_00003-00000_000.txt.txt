Eldora Arrives—

Charil'y's Gone

—From Shangri-La

“Charity cassanova may be no
more on this campus, but the
spirit which she so ably embodied
has been recovered for Grinnell
students," Catherine Funk, editor
or the Scarlet and Black, said
last night in announcing the alps
pointment of Eldora, commenta-
tor extraordinary, to the staff.
Arrangements have just been
completed for Eldoru’s services
during the coming year, she said.

”Naturally i am not at liberty
to divulge Eldora’s true identity,”
Miss Funk added, “but it will
Suffice to say that she is an in-
telligent. cultured woman of the
world, with a finely developed
sense or artistic appreciation. She
is an authority on Greek architec«
ture, particularly the use of the
Doric column.”

II: is believed Eldora will be
able to remain on the staff all
year, as she was classed 4-}? by
the WAAC‘S,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

As Army Invasion Nears, F rosh Women
Extend Most Welcome Hand To Soldiers

Christmas isn‘t close, and our
birthday is long since gone by7
but we're counting days, ncver»
tlieless. Just ninc more, and then
we start wearing sun glasses [is-
cause tiic Brass-Button Dazzle
will be here.

A survey of campus opinion on
the coming invasion has proved
that, whether the dorms exist in
a body or not. there are still only
two schools of‘ thought on the
campus: male and remale,

Men Stick Togeﬂler.

The Grinnell men quizzed were
as unanimous in their opinion as
a Roosevelt. landslide election.
Said they: “We’re glad to have a

chance to see the army in action‘

before we get in ourselves, and
we think the girls must be very
happy about the whole thing."
The girls are.

Seventy per cent of the quad
residents participating in the
survey gave as their first peace
tion a sense of relief over what
they believe will be a solution to
the old Grinnell "social situation."

Most of the others listed the
social possibilities of die post as
part of their opinion, calling at-
tention, however, to the financial
and patriotic aspects of the situ»
ation.

Some of the women's comments
on Grinnell’s added attractions
appear below.

Upperclass Women Think—
nerritli Jane Lovell: “I think it's
a good thing. It'll give iis a. shot
in the arm, We need more effle
cieilcy.”

Betty Ann Wilso “Financially
it sceins all right. otherwise, well,
you know what Sherman said.
Florence Gorsuch: “I’m only glad
It's not the WAAC'S.”

Virginin Dodds: "I think it's a
good function. It might make our
reilows wakc up and take notice."
Miriam Sherman: “It may incon-
venience tiic students, but it is
all for the good old U. S. A.”
Barbara Machiartcr: “I've heard
that the average age is thirty-
flve. That ought to be enough
said. I guess it’s the patriotic
thing to do.”

Ruth Hackett: "I like it, but it
may create a new social prohlcm
instead of solving the old."
Shirley Ripple: "Sure it‘s a good
thing. We strll want Grinnell coir
lege, don't we“

Eloise Panic “It's a good thing.
It Will put Grinncll on the map."
But tiic Preps!

Among the fl‘esllman women,
the general attitude seemed to be
one of ”friendship with our allies."
Tlle following freshmen women
expressed themselves in this way:
Anita Franz: "They are here for
a purpose and we're here for a
purpose."

Barbara Buckley: “I’m always
happy to have t a opportunity to
see more men. This prospect made
me get on the first train here!"
Margaret Jennings: “In peace
time I don't think it would be
such a good idea, but in war
times we all have to make sac-
rifices.”

Marcia Paul: “It doesn't discour»
age me any."

Sally Franks: "I always thought
I’d meet my dream man in a uni.
form.”

Marcia Reed: “It doesn‘t make
any difﬁexence to me; at home
the girls date soldiers as much
as anybody else."

Phyllis Homan: “It’ll pep up the
school and dating them will be
dirrerent"
