Study of German Suffers Decline
of 27% Here in First War Year

College enrollment in German
classes has taken a decided down—
swing ln Grinnell, figures re-
leased today by Jennie Bailey, as-
sistant to the registrar, show.
Only 40 students are enrolled
in all German courses this year,
showing a decrease of 24 students
or 40 per cent from last year.
However. the picture is alleviated
somewhat by the 13 per cent dea
crease in general college enroll—
ment, which pulls the German
mortality back to 27 per cent.
The decrease .c apparently in
keeping with a general language
trend in American colleges and
universities, which shows a spurt
in popularity for Spanish, with
the decline suffered by German
and French, a movement pointed
out a year ago by Miss Bethana

Cash And Carry
Laundry Will Be
Open By Dec. 7

'The Grinnell college laundry will
be available for student use by
December 7 at the latest, H. H.
Fisher, director, said Monday.

At a meeting in the near fu-
ture with Pres, Samuel N, Stev-
'eiis and Fisher, a group of stu—
dent representatives will discuss
the price and type of sei-vicc of the
laundry.

“In order to keep the service
working on a sound basis there
can be no deliveries and no cred-
it," Fisher emphasized." Students
will have to bring their laundry,
come and get it, and pay in cash,"

The flat ironer arrived Mom
day, and as soon as it is padded
and assembled with power and
steam attachments, the laundry
equipment will be complete. '

Like its drop with the rest—there
just aren’t that many students

still the largest of any in the

Not the result of any very re-
cent events, the popularity of
Spanish began shortly before the
first World War, and the same
situation of smaller German
classes and bigger Spanish ones
was observed in Grinncll then,

Army ERC
Now Requires
Draft Release

Oiher Action Permits
l7-Year Olds Assignmeni
On Promise To Enlist

All men wishing to enlist in the
army ERC program must present
a clearance from their local selec»
tive service board, Dean Shelton
L. Beatty said last night.

The new regulation was receiv-
ed by him in a letter from Col.
Raymond Briggs of the seventh
service command headquarters in
Omaha.

This ruling reverses the proced-
uro used for army ERG enlist»
ments for the past few months,
though such a clearance state-
ment was originally required in
the program. The regulation in»
cludos 13 and 19»year old stu.
dents who have registered or who
will register in the future.

Information for men not yet in
the 13-19 age groups was included
in another letter from Lt. R. H.
Ellis of that office. “Students
who have not reached the age of
18 may be included in assigned
quotas, provided that they agree
in writing to enlist in the ERC
upon reaching the age of 13," it
said in part;

“All eiilistments made under the
present quota must be accom.
plished prior to Dec. 51. Then:-
after enli. ments in the Elm will
be limited to incoming freshmen
only."

Housepariy Mysl'ery

There just isn't going to be any-
thiiig ordinary about next Satur-
day night at all. 1t isn‘t enough
that four men’s houses are giving
their semestcr housephrtiesi
enough to set the female popula—
tion in a tiny anyhow.

But now, the boys are going
to be ”different."

In the first place, Gates, Smith
and Rawson won't talk. A sort of
mass resistance by silence has
overtaken three—fifths of the ups
perclassmen, John Hutchins Ken—
drick, social mentor of Thurman
Towers, will only say, “It's a
secret. The dance will be in the
women’s gym, and if you’re iii-
vited, come; but everything else
especially decorations, is secret
ihowever, not so secret that the
guests won’t see them when they
come Saturday night.”

Spies report that Paul Arthur
and his Count Eleven band have
been signed for the music.

Meantime, Dibble has gone ex-
clusive. in its mansion on the
edges of Merrill Park, the Dibble

men have their own housepal‘ty.
far from the nladding crowd and
the women's gymnasium.

The entire first floor of the
hall will be used for dancing,
music being furnished by the
campus Skyliner band. Chapar-
ones will be Mr. and Mrs, Grant
0. Gale. and Mr. and Mrs. Stuart
Gcrry Bmwn.

It will be the first one-hall
houseparty in Gl’innell's recent
history.

Everlon To Address
Penn College Siudenis

Dr. John Scott Everton, dean of
the chapel, will be the main
speaker for Religious Emphasis
week at William Penn college,
Oskaloosa, Iowa.

He will be on that college cem-
pus three days next week. The
general topic for his series of
speeches is, “The Adequacy of
Religion for Students."

Personnel for the White
House is also not complete,
he added, saying it was still
impossible for him to release
the name of the woman who

will be hostess.

Stevens said he hopes the
recreation center will be, ready
for use by the latter part of next
week.

Mrs. Gertrude Adamson, now or
the quadrangle kitchen staff, will
be in charge of the food for the
White House, and her duties in
the quadrangle will be assumed
by existing personnel. '

Coat Estimated at $320 a Month

At the same time the president
outlined budget plans for the em
terpi-ise. Expenscs are estimated
at $320 each month, exclusive of
food used, which will be purchas~
ed in connection with the college
food service.

“The college expects the White
House to operate at a loss, at
least for this year," Stevens said.
