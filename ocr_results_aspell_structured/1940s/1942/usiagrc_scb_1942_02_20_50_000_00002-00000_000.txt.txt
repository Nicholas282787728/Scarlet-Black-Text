O Lent is ,Here.

Humility has seldom ranked topmost among
national virtues, in spite of the many-vowed
prophets who pointedly warn against the
inevitable destruction attendant upon its
conspicuous absence. ”Pride goeth before a
fall” is the popular version of this all too
familiar situation.

Under a democratic system of govern-
ment, anything which molds the individual

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

character strengthens the national morale.
The six week period of Lellt which began
Wednesday offers potentially just such bill-
wark.

A vital religion can no more be separated
from daily living than can morals. Lent is
a period which challenges us to repair or re-
build those inner spiritual resources upon
which will ultimately depend not only our
own individual poise but the stamina of the
whole nation as well.

0 . . . and MacArthur Stands.

One phrase we heard the other night at the
lecture stuck in our milld above all else. it
was “ . . and MacArthur stands with his
back to the sea.”

How a stirring phrase like that, and the
circumstances behind it, could fail to move
the souls of real Americans, is beyond us.
And yet it evidently is doing just that. For
ili Los Allgeles and in Hohoken, from one
coastline to the other, Americans are danc—
ing and singing as though this were some
lovely adventur- But it is not lovelv It is
cold alld bitter, hard, grim, the stal ; trage—
dy of war. It is a struggle ill which your
friend, even you, may be asked to die for
your country.

It is wrong to say that only with 10le
cahm'ets and packed theatres, with civilian
morale upheld by fall dancers and traveling
lends can we win this war. This war will be
won by guts and sacrifice, and no more!

Sometime will a bowed and saddened
Amerca look back on our generation and say
of us, “Remember, while you played around
with me . . . MacArthur stood with his
back to the sea?”

The reason for the delay in
getting the classes started, ac-
cording to Miss Evelyn Gardner,
dean of Women, is that Mrs.
Norris has been waiting to re-
ceive the appropriate certificate
to teach.
