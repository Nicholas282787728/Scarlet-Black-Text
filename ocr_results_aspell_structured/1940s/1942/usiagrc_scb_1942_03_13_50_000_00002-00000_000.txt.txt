O Student Council, ’41-’42.

No one who attended Grinnell last year will
be able to forget the uproar caused by the
Hampton—Pearce election. High pressure ad<
vertising and pre-election cigars and match-
es were only a few of the strategems
used by the candidates. The battle was
fierce, and the results surprisingly close. As
far as the student’s were concerned, it was
”a wonderful election.”

Even though dorms and quad alike are
still discussing that old topic, ”Did the best
man win?” everyone admits that there
have been few men as capable as Kent
Hampton.

The position of Student Council piesident
is, at best a difficult undertaking, and Was
even harder than usual this past yeari It
is quite a job to keep both students and fac-
ulty contented, and Hampton has done it
well.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

A year has passed since then, and Hamp-
ton has made great strides in furthering
the importance and possibilities of good
student government at Grinnell. 4

It is hoped that his successor Bill Kal-
oupek, will piofit by Hampton‘s pace set-

0 Both Sides.
Poets and youths from time immemorial
have linked romance with the spring. But
when a generation has passed its spring-
time it looks upon later springs as immoral.

Then too, every generation considers its
own moral code as the Absolute, the perfect
and unchangeable, and by their standards,
they judge us.

This, of course, is only a. human charac—
teristic, and not one to be condemned

Yet we too have the human characteris-
tic of disliking such intrusion into our per—
sonal affairs, and of the suspicion which
promps the intrusion.

At least, older generation, leave us to our
hand holding during blackouts.

O Appreciation.

Last night Dr. Potter delivered his final
lecture in the series concerned with Inter«
national Relations It is with a feeling of
regret that we say goodbye to this dignified,
scholarly gentleman.

There is no need to emphasize the timeli-
ness of his message, nor to express general
disappointment that a larger percentage of
the student body did not turn out.

There is a need to recognize the extreme
importance of this type of man as a molder
of the more peaceful and happy World to
come. A thorough scholar speaking with
conviction, Dr, Potter goes forward in his
work with our best wishes and aspirations.

When the more important and perplexing
struggle for a ”just peace” rolls around,
men such as Dr. Potter will have made that
task a little more comprehensive and sol-
uble. Again we express our appreciation for
the opportunity of meeting and knowing Dr.
Potter.

Thursday Morning

“Procedures in Getting a Jo "
was the topic discussed yesterday
morning by Maurice D. Woolf,
director of vocational guidance.
Mr. Woolf spoke before a senior
assembly.

He slated that students should
know their own interests and
abilities, so that they can com-
pare them with the requirements
of various jobs.

In his discussion on obtaining
employment, Woolf said that a
job seeker should prepare foi- an
interview, by studying his pros-
pective company and knowing
their personnel policies.

He also stated that the letter
of application should carry the
applicant's personality. “Don't
write a stereotyped letter," he
said, “but inject yourself into it."

Woolf stressed the fact that
the applicant should notify his
employer within 10 days whether
or not he intends to accept or
iejeci. an offs red position

Woolf also announced that one
of the coming speakers in fresh-
man vocational orientation will
be Miss Harriet O’Shea, con-
sulting psychologist from Purdue
University.

“She is scheduled to spcak here
next weekend.” he said.

Shelton d... Beatty, dean of pen
sonncl administration, pncscntcd
a. new guidance bulletin at the
meeting. “This builciin will be
given out to freshmen in the near
future," Woolf stated.
