GRlNNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
Messiah Chorus Hits Top Mark

By Bnl (is Mattheu s

A one hundred and fifty voice
chorus with a supporting cast of
soloists and orchestra, under the
direction of J. Forrest West, head
of Grilmell’s music department,
song an organized zmd‘ intense
Messiah Friday evening; but the
presentation was too efficient to
allow much interpretive feeling.
Tone quality was blended so
that times a solid mass or sound
touched the depths of the au-
dieiirc; tempo changes wei-c exact
and strict; volume swell and die
miiiuendo tollowed the director's
unrelenting baton for maximum
effect; but the whole concert was
too machine-like, too well manag-
ed. and allowed too little relaxa-
tion. It was here now and gone,
with no time to think what was
here, and only the memory of a
few exaltereti chords to take back.
For its technique and accuracy,
the concert was the best perfor-
inancc here in several years
Harold Reeves, ot Coe college‘s
music faculty, sang the tenor
solos with a. touching high-voice
lilt; Miss Mary Wrany, Griiincll
music teacher, handled 'her diffir
cult part masterfully. The two

student soloists were also expert.

Ward Schwab is the first fresh-
