BElllNﬂ lHE BRUSH

WITH AL FRISBIE

Like the boy in one of Sherwood

‘Anderson's stories, "We want to

know why."

The refusal of Midwest Confer-
ence potentates to abolish the
freshman rule doesn't make
sense, With schools all over the
country permitting yearlings to
participate in varsity athletics,
the Midwest officials clocked ex-
citedly, wagged a warning finger,
and failed to relax the ruling.

To give credit where credit
is due, it should be elnpllﬂsizetl
that Grinnell, ZIIOnmollth, and 006
(Ill! Vole to allow freshman in
play varsity sports, but the nega-
tive ballots of Cornell, Knox,
L'uvrenoe, Ripun, and BeIDiC
spelled defeat for the mavement.

The fact that colleges much
larger than Midwest schools are
now playing freshmen, (take for
example those in the Missouri
Valley conference) is not the an.
ly argument at can be voiced
for prep parti pation.

The senate recently passed the
18.19 year old draft law. If boys
of 13 and 19 are considered phys-
ically fit to fight for their coun—
try, surely they are old enough
to compete in varsity athletics.
Government officials have stressed

intercollegiate competition, Since
freshmen are no longer draft cx-
empt why should those who are
of varsity calihre he dcnied the
benefits of college competition?

This question cannot be dis—
missed on the grounds that, inas-
much as very fcw first year men
would he able to make the var-
sity grade, it is of relative un—
importance.

At the conference meeting last
Saturday, representatives from
only one Midwest school felt that
they could continue inter—col—
legiate athletics next year with-
out using freshmen.

Therefore, it would seem that
most of our Midwest dignitaries
would do well to takc off those
rose colored glasses and come
back to the land of reality.

I7 Man Freshman Cage
Squad Hopes For Game

Because a conference decision to
disqualify freshmen from varsity
competition was not changed last
week, the athletic department
will try to arrange some intercol-
legiate games for the prep bas-

ketball squad, Les Duke, coach
for freshman basketball, said to-
day.

Duke has hcsn working with a
seventeen man squad this week,
sciimmaging them against the
varsity with fair success.

The names of four men, Dick
l‘l-ettlex', Fred Collins, Kermit
Steinbeck, and Ray Mourer, were
not included in the Scarlet, and

the values to be derived from Black story last Friday.
