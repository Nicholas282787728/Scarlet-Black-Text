JANUARY 20, I942

 

PaHerson Holds
Ripon Ace To
4 Free Throws

Grinnell’s basketball team
won its third straight game
since Christmas vacation,
when it rambled over the
Ripon Redinen Saturday night at
Ripon, Wis, 35 to 27,

The inn placed the Pioneers
in undisputed possession of sec-
onil place in the Midwest con~
iel'elwc slanilin s as unvrence,
who was previously tied with
Grinnell, did not play a loop on-
counter.

Top honors for the evening
should go to Capt. Paul Patter—
son, who was given the difficult
task of holding down Ted Sca-
lissi, who had bucketcd 41 points
in the previous two games. Pat-
terson held the Ripun star to four
free throws all night.

The Redmen employed a shift-
ing man to man defense that
checked the Pioneer offense same—
wliat in the first half. The score
at the end of thc first half was
13 to 9 in Grinnell’s favorJHow
ever, the score does not show that
the Pioneers were able to hit
only 5 out of 37 shots at the
basket in the first half..

Grinnell’s offense clicked in the
second half. and the Pioneers won
easily. The points for Grinncll
were evenly divided as every man
that played scored. Edd Bowers,
guard, led the scoring with nine
points.
