More Towels Used.

Since the conditioning- program
got under way. Duke said that
three times as many towels are
being used in the gym. So a new
expense is being added to the
accounts of the athletic depart-
ment.

Intramural Director John c.
Truesdale, who is at uie head of
the conditioning program, said
that full cooperation is expected
of the men who are required to
participate in the daily exercises.
He added that so far every ewe
dence has led him to believe that
Gl-innell students will take part
in the program to the fullest ex-
tent, and that slackers will be
much in the minority.

Class Schedule.

Classes meet four times a day
at the gymnasium—at 8:15 a. m..
1:1 p. m. 2:15 p. m.. and s
p. m. These classes are being
carried out in a manner prescrib-
ed iu the army manual, Exer-
cises will stress muscle building,
flexibility. and endurance, Trues—
dalc said.

Classes will be held under strict
military discipline according to
Triiesdale. He said that sociability
would be of minor importance
and that during the exercise pcr-
iods every moment would be
made to count in order that stu—
dents would get the most out of
the work.

John Kendrick. sophomore resi-
dent of Cotes Hall. was elected
social chairman of that hall at

THE FRESHJVIAN RULE: At the
meeting of the Midwest confer-
ence directors there was unani-
mous agreement among the eight
colleges that the freshman iule
should not be upset until it is
absolutely necessary. . .The ques-
tion will come up again at the
regular May meeting. but it will
probably be handled in the same
way. . .Corleton college recently
voted to let freshmen entering
thene this semester begin im-
mediate participation in all var—
sity sports except football and
basketball. . .We don't know why
they were excluded from them
sports.
