Grinnell Symphony Orchesl'ra
Plays First Concert Sunday

Frallck‘s ”Symphony
in D minor” and Ludwig
Van Beethoven’s ”Concerto
for Piano and Orchestra in
c minor, opus 37" will make up
the program for Sunday's concert
by the Grinnell Symphony Or»
chestl‘a, according to Glenn D.
swan, conductor. The second
number will feature Sarah Inness
MacDonald, assistant professor of
piano, as soloist,

The concert will be presented
Sunday at 4:30 p, m. in Herrick
chapel.

“This concert,” Swan stated,
"represents the second attempt on
the part or Grinnell college to in-
augurate a symphony orchestra
for central Iowa.

Franck’s symphony. which was
first performed at the Paris 00n-

Cesar

servatory in 1889, met with a
storm of criticism by his collea-
gues and prominent conposers of
the day. However the work rose
to heights far beyond all expecta-
tions and stands today as one of
the most beloved of all symphonic
literature.

On the other hand, the concert
at which Beethoven first played
his “c minor concerto" in 1803,
although performed under great
handicaps, proved a huge success
The solo piano part was played on
a miserable box of wires, and the
accompanying orchestra, a hastily
improvised affair, had to appear
without a single adequate rehear-
sal.

His "0 minor Concerto” was the
last which Beethoven treated in
the time-honored manner as a dis-
play piece tor a soloist.

By Stati Writer

After shaking a couple of ex-
cess facility members out of
my board and counting my
loose silver, this writer cone
eluded last night at the filial
rehearsal that the Faculty
Frivols was at least plenty
frivolous.

With more features than the
Srarnese twins, the Frivols is a
professorinl panic of hurrying
Hitlers, LaGuardias, crap-shoot-
ers, and uniformed serVice men.
Promises value.

While all that awaits the stu-
dent who places his 40 cents or
Gadabout ticket on the line to-
night or tomorrow night was not
viewed, the real McCoy blackout
alone is worth the pass cash.

Some of the repartee should
perhaps have been plowed under
with the rest of the Midwestern
maize a, couple or three years ago
when the FAA ruled.
