Our Move Nexi—-—

That time is here again. We‘ve been in
school for four weeks and good resolutions
are dropping away faster than autumn
leaves. Take the library for instance Oh
yes, we know. There isn’t any White House
and we have to meet people somewhere And
if they want it quiet in there why don’t
they put the individual study desks upstairs
for people who want to study and put the
big tables downstairs so we can sit there and
talk? .

Library arrangements ar n’t perfect yet.
The staff itself will be the st to admit it.
And perhaps the new scringency of rules is
the wrong approach to the entire situation.
But thus far circumstances have proved
that rules must be enforced strictly
by a few people because the majority
of the people
enforcement. There is a minimum of ord-
er to be maintained in any building used
by many people. If that order is not volun-
teered by many it must be imposed by a few.
Perhaps you don't agree with the way in
which it is being imposed. Mere objection
is poor argument, however. The best so—
lution is to eliminate the need for paternal-

istic restraints, orders handed down from
above, and to substitute a mode of volun-
tary restraints If we can prove we don’t
need a supervisor every minute, the library
staff will probably enjoy as much as we the
abolition of these threats of suspension
from the library or probation in class \vorl'
We don‘t like theml They don’t either. But
until we, not they, find a solution, they will
have to stand.

The next move is up to us, and it must
be a real move, not just another good reso-
lution.

iListen, Uncle Sam---

Maybe it's unpatl'iotic to bring up things
like this in wartime, but frankly, the Gl‘lrk
nell men are getting a little bit curious
about their mail. It’s become practically a
United States tradition, Uncle Sam, not
merely another Giinnell one, to have mall
delivered to,the address marked upon it.
One might almost say we expect it.

There are five men’s houses off campus
this year. They are separate from and do
not use the quadrangle facilitiesol mail
delivery. Yet mail, including special deliv-
ery letters and packages, though plainly
marked with the street address of these
houses, is consistently delivered to the‘col—
lege book store or the quadrangle sWitch-
board. The post man walks down the streets
where these houses are located He stops
at all other residences on the block except
the college houses Would it be too much
to ask him to leave our letters at our resi-
dence, to which they were addressed, in—
stead of taking them to the bookstore or
college central to be delayed for perhaps
days?

You say someone must sign for special
delivery letters and that is why they, are
delivered to switch. Is there difference be
tween the signature of the switchboard op-
erator and a dormitory housemotlier if the
man himself is not there to receive the
letter? We think not.

Mail that is addressed to a town house
can be found almost anywhere on campus
with the notation “no delivery there” writ-
ten on it. We don’t want to condemn you
without cause, Uncle Sam, but we feel an
explanation is due the men of Grinnell.

Do You Have—

Quad Staves Oil: Rats

Grinncll has been invaded. No,
relax soldiers; neither the Japs
nor the Germans have come, In-
stead, the quadrangle and the
men's halls are being overrun
with mice. '

October is the time of year
when the little rodents make
their annual migration from the
fields and woods to people's
houses, college dormitories, and
other buildings. And Grinncll is
caught in the thick of it.

Eight mice have been caught
in Dibble to date. At present
there are three mice runnmg
gaily around on third Haincs.
Every hall and cottage is report-
ed tb be sufferingithe extent of

timldjty of the inhabitants.

When a cc-cd screams these
days, it's hard to tell whether
she is going steady or whether
she has mice. But when a Grinr
nell girl climbs the wall of her
mom or finds a perch on the
mirror of her dresser, it is core
tain she has mice. Though the
men‘s balls are taking the invasr
ion with comparative calm, the
quad is far from welcoming its
little visiors. So if you are pass-
ing by some dark night and hear
a scream, don't worry. Nobody
is being butchered; nobody had a
fatal accident; the quad isn’t on
fire. Some fair co-ed has found
a mouse instead of a rat.

OCTOBER [3. 1942

W

Go On and On
And On And On— \

Grinnell has changed since last
year. The dorms are gone, the
White House is gene, A. R. H. is
gone, and the army has come;
bllt examinations go on the same
as ever.

College has been in session al-
most a month now. Last week
many pi-cfcsscrs gave their first
exams of the year, and this
week many more are making up
for lost time. And the fact that
tests are given in the gym or
the quad or some other strange
meeting place hasn’t affected
thcir quality, students sadly re-
port. ,

We have the same blue books.
the same questions, the same
courses. ‘Grlnnell still stays up
all night, trying to absorb three
weeks' knowledge in a few hours.
Alarm clocks still ring before
sunrise, and students still stag-
ger to class, sleepily trying to
recollect what they studied the
night before.

War has changed a lot of
things here in Grinnell. but not
the examination system. Nothing
short of the actual end of the
world wul ever change that,
gloomy students philosophize.
