Of Frosh's Only Game

Following a personal investiga-
tion of the facts last night Dr.
Samuel N. Stevens today upheld
the findings ,of the personnel
board which ruled the players in»
eligible. “The ruling of the corn-
rnittee is sound," he said, “But
it ,ono of those rare instances
where a principle in itself sound,
acts to work an injustice upon' a
few of the boys."

The Grinnell-Cornell frosh foot-
fall game, scheduled for this af-
ternoon has been cancelled for
laek of a full team of eligible
players, G. Lester Duke, director
of Intercollegiate activities an-
nounced yesterday.

Scholastic deficiencies cut the
fifteen-man squad to a mere ten.
necessitating cancellation of this
traditional part of the homecom-
ing program, he said.

Duke expressed concern over
the fact that this would probably
have been the only game of the
season for the freshmen. The
boys have been working hard for
a month and are now to he de»
prived of their climax because of
the minority’s grades.

It is the first time in twenty-
five years that the Grinnell fresh-
men have failed to produce a

In Homecoming
TiI’r Saturday

Injuries, pm: of the Pioneer grid—
iron squad since the beginning of
the season, struck again at
Coach Ben Douglas’ team last
weekend, ripping apart what ap-
peared to be a winning comblns
ntron as Harry Waters was bench-
erl because of a sprained anlrle
received in last Week’s Beahawk
game.

When they meet the Corn-ell
Put-pie Saturday afternoon in the
Homecoming contest at least
four regulars will be on the
bench, Douglas announced today,

In the backfield they are Harry
waters, with a sprained ankle;
Ed Nagel, with an early season
,chnrleyhorso which keeps him
off the starting lineup; and Jack
Mearane, still recovering from
the effects of the Knox game
two weeks ago.

Waters, playing in the back-
field for the first time in the
Beahawk game, turned in an
outstanding performance as a
ball carrier bcfore he was injured.

However, with Waters on the
bench, and Ed Nagel and Jack
McGrane in rather dubious con-
dition, Douglas will have to turn
the backfield over to Augie
Gruening and the sophomore
class: Tex Kaufmann, Ph'ilip
Southworth, Bob Barrett, and Al
Nichols, all of whom have seen
a good deal of experience this
season.

,Althougn Capt. Curly Bishop
will be in the lineup Saturday de-
spite a severe black eye, product
of last week’s game, Tod Kennes
fick, regular end, and Bob Cor-
rigan, reserve end, will both be
on the bench; Kennefick with a
foot infection and Corrigan with
a poor shoulder, which throws
the catchinghurden on reserves
Brunie Vanstrum and Dean .New-
ell.

Benny YeIIs—

Hey Doc!

—Again, and Again

Although the doctor's bill for the
football team has assumed only
moderate proportions so far this
year, Coach Benny Douglas still
claims to have a gripe coming.
It seems that the injuries which
do occur come just in time to
mess up the crucial moments.
Just Look at the Record!

Outstanding among these un-
orthodox temporary invalidisms
are the cases of Curly Bishop and
Jack McGrane.

1n the kickoff against the
Pre-Flight team at Newton,
Curly threw his head against an
embryo Bvlator’s knee, producing
a state of grogginess which kept
him out of the game for three
quarters, McGrane, playing
against Knox, also took advantage
of an opportunity to leave the
field after the game's first play
by slitting his tongue and strainc
ing his shoulder.

Jack Bredimus has developed a

mania for breaking his nose.

The night before the first
game of the season. Augie Gruen—
ing turned up in the hospital
with a temperature of 104. No
logical reason for this condition
has been forwarded, except that
doctors mention influenza. At any
rate, he didn't pull out of it
completely for ten days.

Benny asks for no sympathy.

“Injuries are really light,“ he
says. “Football is a tough game.

But it does kind of make a guy
cuss when his smr kicker gem
knocked out before he can waft
the smelling salts under the nose
of his other star kickers.”
