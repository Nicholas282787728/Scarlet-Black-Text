Sleigh Ride Plans--

'We'll Have l’r Tonighi Wi+h
Or Wii'liou’r SnowI - - Bremicker

“To be 01' not to he?" has
been the question people have
been asking James Miles,
Gadabont chairman, this
week. “Whatever happened to the
sleigh ride?” people kept asking.

The time has come, however.
and the slc;gh ridc will bc hold.
The Gadsbout's prayer for snow
has at last becn answered, and
all arrangements have bccn com-
plcted “The only thing wc are
afraid of now is a sudden thaw,"
Miles said

Arrangements have been made
for a place to skate, but Grinnell
students will have to forego that
plcasurs if the weather becomes
warmer. Ton slcighs lliwe bccn
ordered. and enough snow should
be left on the country roads to
make it worthwhile.

Thc slciglis will lcavc at s p m.,
from the swimming pool, and Will
retum to Griiincll in time for an
hour's dancing at the men’s
dorms. Gates and Smith clubc
rooms will be open, and refresh-
ments for the wcary travelers
will be furnished in the men’s
dining room. Miles said.

The Gudabouts first planned to
have dancing and food at the
country club, but found that it
had been previously reserved for
a Valentine party.
