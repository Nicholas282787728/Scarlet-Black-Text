The Militar ---
Male Undergradua’res Badly
Filled for Army, Survey Shows

BY ASSOCIATED COLLEGIATE PRESS

The average male undergraduate is badly prepared for his
ine table life in the armed forces and American educational
institutions are giving no evidence that he will be any better
prepared in the near future.

That, reports Richard C. Himmel, chairman of the board of
control of the University of Chicago’s Dally Maroon, is the
clear indication from a telegraphic poll of 7‘2 college and
university student edit is. The poll aimed to determine how
much lire—induction military training is available to college
men and whether the character of this training is such
that it will give these men special army qualifications, lead—
ing eventually to a commission.

College editors report that universities and colleges introduced vast
changes in curriculums after Pearl Harbor and 74 or more new “(le-
fense courses" were reported by the 72 schools. Requests have been
made to the war department for ROTC units by non-ROTC schools and
several ROTC institutions have asked that the size of their units be
increased. The war dcportmont replied that i'uuitcd facilities mode it
impossible to establish ncw units or ninlzc substantial inorcoscs in thc
sizes of the units already established.

Precinduction military training is of two kinds, basic and spmializcd.
Into the basic classification fall Reserve Officers Training corps and
similar devices to teach military fundamentals. Most of the courses
listed by coilcgc editors as “defense courses" fall into the specialized
classification. ROTC is in the former classification because about 75
per cent of its man-power takes only the first two years of this train-
ing, known as the “basic" course. Completion of this coursc does not
make one eligible for a commission.

The "advanced” ROTC, given in the junior and senior
years, has a limited enrollment imposed by the war depart-
ment. Only about 20,000 of an estimated 650,000 men in
the institutions of higher learning in the country are ac»
commodcteal in thc ROTC "advanced" course. Only on
completion of the ”advanced" course are men eligible
for commissions. ’

“Defense courses" reported to the Maroon are of three types:
specialized pie-induction military training, best exemplified
by the numerous “cartography" courses which have a def-
inite military implication; courses in ”fire fighting" and
"knitting” would fall into a general civilian defense classi-
fication; and war industries training courses include such
courses as “personnel administration" and ”industrial micro-
biology.”
Immediately other Pearl Harbor, students exerted pressure to get
some kind of basic military training in macs where there wos no such
training available in) thorn. Colleges and universities wero faced with
the problem of either giving their students no military training or
cstabiisiung such trainlng themselves, since the war department gave
no evidence that it planned to do anything about it.
In most cases the schools chose to have no. basic military
training and to offer their students instead a counter- r-
ritant, “defense courses.” Student pressure was temporar-
ily relieved when schools all over the country expanded
their curricula to give vital “defense courses" and men all
over the country began to become experts on “Morse code",
“newspaper Chinese," “military communications,” “mili-
tary mathematics,” “mick driving,” and other specialized
army techniques.

Only three schools successfnll attempted lifter Pearl Harbor
to get some kind of basic ml. tony twinin - the University
of North Carolina, Washington and Lee, and Mnhlenbei'g
college.

A statement by Lt. Gen. Ben Lear, the survey report says,
is the best substantiation of the fact that the college man‘s
first cry for basic military training was the right cry. Gen-
eral Lear, in response to a query from a parent asking why
his son wasn’t an officer when he had had a college educa-
intion, said: “Academic training is not of itself sufficient to
make a soldien These college young men in most instances
have the physical and mental qualities of an officer, but be-
cause of lack of military knowledge they must join the
greenest recruits.”
