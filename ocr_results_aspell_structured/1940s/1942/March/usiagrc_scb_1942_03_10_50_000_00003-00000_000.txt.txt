No Clues—

Window Breaking Case Unsolved

By Lucia Ca rler

Who broke the glass in the li-
brary door?

An air of mystery prevails
throughout the campus. No one
talks, There are no clues. Arna-
teur sleuths, trailing magnifying
glasses and ﬁnger print powder
in the best “whodunnit” fashion,
have haunted the library steps
since Sunday afternoon, But still
the mystery remains unsolved.

Saturday night the library was
locked as usual, and the glass
panel on the north door was un-
disturbed. Sunday afternoon the
library was unlocked, and the
glass panel from the north door
was scattered all over the steps.
There were no clues at the scene
of the crimeino bricks or stones
or pieces of wood, just broken
glass.

Local officials are stymied, and
on the campus guesses run high
as to the identity of the culprit.

Today a wood panel adorns the
north door of the library. Faculty
students, and administration were
all discussing the question of the
day—who broke the glass on the
library door?

There will be no job survey this
year because most of the senior
men will be eligible for induction
into the armed forces, Maurice
D. Woolf, director of vocational
guidance, said today.

Personnel representatives of
various ﬁrms will be on the cam-
pus to interview students for jobs.

All students are urged to meet

\ hand, the process would not be

completed for at least a year, ac-
cording to Lovell.

Candidates for
Student Council
Give Addresses

Kaloupek

Living in town should be an ad-
vantage to a Student council
president, for he has no domin-
eering hall relationship, yet can
be representative of the quad-
rangle, dormitories, and town,
William Kaloupck. candidate for
that post, told a chapel audience
this morning.

Kaloupek said he was for in-
telligent, aggressive, student fac-
ulty relations, but that there was
a need for clear definition of the
Student Council's function.

nThe student Council must not
be the Scapegoat,” he pointed out,

PaHerson

“I am what I am and I intend to
remain niat way," Claire Pat-
terson, candidate for president of
the Student Council, said this
morning in chapel.

“I will see Stevens and I will

want to know my duties and
what is expected of me," he said.

He pointed out that any dirty
work would be shoved off on the
housekeeping department and that
he planned to organize student
government as to specific duties
and powers,
