Student Plays
Completed--But
All Lack Titles

The four authors of original one
act plays are still searching for
titles, Sarah Sherman Pryor, di-
rector of drama, announced today.

The plays, which will be pro-
duced sometime this spring, are
still without names, though read—
ings and casting tryouts have al-
ready begun. They will continue
every evening at 7:15 until a suffi»
cient number of potential actors
has been found, she said.

Three of the four plays have a
war theme, though only two are
serious in nature. War and col—
lege life seem to go hand in hand
in the modern young playwright's
mind.

Barbara McClenon, Read senior,
has attempted a college comedy
of life in the quandrahgle, while
Kathryn Mills, town woman, has
written a serious play concerning
a pro-Nazi Iowa farmer.

William Buckley, Clark senior,
has written a one act comedy con-
cerning a grandmother’s desire for
an airplane ride.

written a melodrama of subversive

The play takes place in a night
club, where evasion of the draft is
only a minor stratagem.

Anyone interested in trying out
for a part should see Mrs. Pryor
immediately.

A talk by Henry S. conard, pro-
fessor of botany, will be the main
feature of Monday's Grinnell radio
broadcast, according to Herschel
M. Colbert, head of the radio
studior

Dr, Conard is scheduled to ~dis-
cuss the advantages and possibili—
ties of Iowa for outdoor recrea»

gram will be a concert by the
Grinnell college band, Colbert said.

It Will be the second of a series
of Grinnell broadcasts to be heard

"The purpose of Dr. Conard’s
talk is to show Iowans that it
isn’t necessary to go great dis-
tances to enjoy outdoor recrea-
tion," Colbert said, "Dr. Conard
will discuss places of interest
which may be visited and re-
creational facilities available here
in lowa."

Colbert requested that on Mons
days from 4 to 4:30 p. m. Stu-
dents should be as quiet as possi—
ble in the vicinity of the chapel.
“Since it is necessary that we
broadcast parts of our programs
from the chapel, it is essential
that there be as little noise as
possible in that vicinity,” he said.

“The school has been extrava.
gant this year in using heat and
light," he said. Up to and in-
cluding February, 315,673 kilo-
watt hours of electricity and 34,~
674,500 thousand pounds of steam
have been used.

The decorating ioh used duller
paint in the rooms. and because of
this the paint absorbs more light,
making it necessary to use Larger
lamps which in turn are respon-
sible for the need of more light in
the dormitories, Meyers said.

In the whole school year, for
example, in 1931 to 1932 only
300,159 kilowatt hours were used,
which is 15,514 kilowatt hours less
than has been used in the first six
months of this school year.

The largest consumption of elec-
tricity during one month in the
last ten years as in the 1940 to
1941 school year when 70.628 kilo-
watt hours were used in the
month of December. So far this
year December was again the high
month, during which 65,499 kilo—
watt hours of current were used.

In comparing the months in the

past, adjacent to the months re.-

corded so far this year, it has
been found that the amount of
electricity used has increased cons
tinually since 1931—

The greatest amount of steam
used in thc last ten years was in
1932 to 1933 when 62,237,100
thousand pounds of steam were
consumed. This year, in six
months, the college has consumed
34,674,500 thousand pounds of
steam.

The average room has 40 square
feet of radiation, and one square
foot of radiation will condense one
fourth pound of steam an hour,
thus an ordinary room will con—
dense ten pounds an hour, Meyers
explained.

Steam was used in the largest
quantities in one month in 1940
to 1941 when during the month
of December 9,259,000 thousand
pounds of steam were used This
year in January 8,740,300 thou—
sand pounds of steam were con-
surned by the sohooL

Reasons given by Meyers for the
excessive use of steam were that
students and faculty leave win-
dows open which allow a large
part of the heat to arm the out—
side atmosphere. Also faulty use
of thermostats in the dormitories
and Quadrangle was a cause.

War Chest Gets Penny
For Each Tardy Student

The cash register tinkles for Grin-
hell’s wartime chest every time a
student arrives late to one of
Walter J. Schnerr’s French
classes.

Under a new ruling, students
pay $01 for each minute they are
late. This forfeit goes into the
war relief funds.
