ALL COMES TO HIM THAT--

Since time immemorial, the chronic com—
plaint of upperclassmen, but not uppercrust-
men, has been ”the food situation" at Grin-
nell. There are still those among us who
do not know, or who are too lazy to find out
the facts concerning the food problem pecu-
lar to institutional feeding. Grinnell is an
institution

We hear ”gripes” because there are no
milk pitchers on the tableswnly glass ser-
vice. True, the men are used to a pitcher
of milk on their table. Now that the army
is going to be eating and drinking milk along
with the students, one must take into con-
sideration the problem that pllts into the lap
of the Grinnell dairies. A thousand extra
throats to keep moist is of more than
minute importance.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

“Where are the third helpings of meat?"
Have you students ever heard of rising costs
and falling quantities available for consum-
er consumption? In addition to our armed
forces, we are also contributing to the feed
ing of our allies.

Slow? Naturally you cannot feed live huns
dred people as fast as three hundred. But,
all comes to him that stands and waits. Be
patient. When the student help that will wait
on the army is working, the dining situation
will be alleviated fifty per cent. There will
be less people to feed at once; you, yes,
every one of you, will become accustomed
to seeing a member of the opposite sex sit-
ting across the table or across the aisle
from you and you will calm down and
adapt yourself to the situation like men and
women. Patience is c viltue. Let’s be virtu-
ous for a while, shall we?

LETTER IN APPRECIATION - -

TYou turn up every once in a while, but
you are more than just the old friend; what

you have to say is more than merely the
old refrain. Indeed your official position
has had less to do with making you one of
us than that way you have of realizing the
local situation and interpreting it in long—
range telms. The other day you had a few
things to say about the security which in-
security can never destroy. You mentioned
the sea as an example of that which is relv
atively changeless; you spoke of rocks and
land and fog and liberal education; you con-
sidered the oftenstalked of “spirit of Grin—
nell." That elusive spirit has been built of
personalities more than anything else, of
a great many personalities. We sang ”How
Firm a Foundation” and thought of how
much you Seemed a part of the chapel, of
Grinnell, and of steadfastness itself. Thank
you, Stoddard Lane, for being a solid rock
in the sea of a busy morning.

What did the prep girl mean
when she said, “They're here for

purpose." when someone asked
her what she thought of the army

The Bond dance last night was
well populated by college stus

many more present if the night

pleas of seven frantic patriots

Son, but they aren't the only ones
who are in there pitching when
it comes to making the pigskin
sport a treat for spectators.

Some of the most colorful mo-
merits of every game are the per-
formances by the college band.
They slide through these forma-
tions with apparent ease. but into
the perfecting of their marching
technique. in addition to their
music practice hours, has gone a.

team function.

First, the rudiments of military
driu are mastered by all band
members. For every thi‘eesminute
formation performance they spend
st least half an hour in outdoor
drill. The printed directions or
their movements require at least
three hours of work every week.
A master drawing is sketched,
check-ed for feasibility with the
same care that accompanies a
squad chalk—talk, and then copies
are mimeogrcphed for marchers.

Then there is the little detail
of the music itself. Very often,
since school songs of smaller col-
leges are not available in print,
a special arrangement for each
must be made. Last fall, Kenneth
Simmons, band director, estimated
he spent so hours in such work
preparing music for the six games
