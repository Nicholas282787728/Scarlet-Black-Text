We Toss An Orchid---

Campus activities and talent are, like
prophets, usually without honor in their
own land. The college population is fre-
quently surprised to hear praise for some
Grinnell activity or person long taken for
granted. Into this category falls the Grin—
nell radio program series of this year 'Fol-
lowing the general fluster at tlle opening
of a campus station last winter, apathy re«
placed interest, and the programs went on
with no particular aid of enthusiasm on the
pelt of students.

We particularly recommend, therefore,
that you listen to the current Grinnell Col-
lege programs, heard over WOI every Tues-
day at 4:15 1). In. Not only will you hear
interesting presentation of the lives of
people you know, but you will be hearing
first-class radio entertainment

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Under the tutelage of Thomas Duncan,
himself a professional radio writer, the
scripts have taken on a fastvmoving, well-
balanced style that is never boring or
wordy. The techniques of production are
being increasingly well-handled, the topics
are varied, and the prospect of hearing
Grinnell profs turned actors is engaging to
say the least.

In a sense, these shows are this coln
lege at its best, for they will in the course
of a year, touch on every aspect of Grin-
nell as an academic institution, and will even
include that latest addition to the Grinnell
picture: the army.

So we urge you to listen. Mr. Duncan,
and all the students and faculty members
collaborating on the program are doing a
fine job. Our collective hat is off to them.

Now You Have Been Told-~-

Last night you received a sheet of sug—
gestions anent the dining room. These tips
were not fostered by administrative author-
ities. They came as a result of complaints
by studentsgbotll men and women who
were repulsed by the conduct of some stu-
dents during meal times. The suggestions
preferred deal mainly with dinner, but they
Could Well be heeded during any meal.

That here is a definite situation to be
dealt with will be admitted by everyone.
That the rules have been set down are pure
common sense will be readily admitted.
That both the morale of the students and
visitors will be boosted a thousand per cent
is a fact that you will all perceive once the
“new order" is under way. If for no other
reason than a selfish one, it will pay you
all botll now and ill the future~to mind
your manners. Don’t forget that bad habits
nurtured in college are not so easily drop
ped after graduation. For the good of yolllu
self and Grinnell, snap out of your second
childhood in the dining room.

IT WAS BO’UND 'ro HAPPEN:
With Grinnell men suffering the
first blow to their cgo with the
invasion of son army men, some
one of the local wolflings had to
reciprocate by helping to build
morale among the female Con<
ungcnt of the service. Louis
Sclluler, who has been making
frequent trips to Des Moines for
s K: B ads, was surprised to learn
that the WAACS are stationed
there. And llls dlscoveries about
their G. I. apparel are even more
surprising. Well now the Little
Corporal knows the army inside
out.

SAGA: snack, rumor has it, has

THAT ‘VISITI'NG moms-

QIANS’ JOKE would have been
even funnier it the Gates men in
tuxedos, who thought of the
crack in thc first place, had been
allowed to carry out their origin-
al plan and carry in Lurlc. feet
first.
. EVERYBODY KNOWS it takes
lots of time and lots of trips to
Des Moines to enlist in the army,
Then why are ehnn Pitts and
Tell smnnirold so all'uxgic to the
word “Babe's” lately?

WITH DU!) common suppos~
edly descending on Grinnell with
u gun in his hand and Kroeger
in his hair, We might remind
Fearless of the applicability of
the Coast Guard molt “Stamper
Paratus.”

Baumarlrl is right about those
runctlons anyway.

in the Men’s Gym was as quiet as
a mouse, so, naturally, the scene
would not have been complete
without s mouse. And, sure
enough a mouse did appear on
the left flank of the room. It
worried some of the boys, par—
ticularly Candidate Roscoe Walk-
or, .lr. But the mousie skidded
around the corner in a column
right without further ado and
the field day for the field mouse
ended. . . .

It is definitely established that
Candidate “hunch R. Ayers, Jr.,
is one of the "you-ca.rl»count-on-

The only trouble is, you can
count on him up to four only. He
