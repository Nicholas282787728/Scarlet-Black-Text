Board, have provided a topic

tion scheduled for March 22,
three junior women loom as pres-
idential nominees. At present
they are Miriam Johnson, Haines;
Doris Nininger. James- and Der-
rith Jane Lovell, Read.
According to past experience,
all three seem capable of the re-
sponsibility. Miss Johnson and
Miss Lovell have served on the

Student Council. Miss Niningei-
has ably filled the position of
quadrangle social chairman this
year.

suggested numerous times as
probable candidates for the W0-

primary ballot for student Coun-
cil President, has contributed
much to Gn‘nnelrs defense pro<
gram for women. She has been
active in W. R, A. and taken
part in intramural activities.

Lois Clifton has taken an in-
terest in activities, and is as
well known on the campus as in
town. She is a logical contender
for the town women's represen-
tative.

ant figure in the time she has
