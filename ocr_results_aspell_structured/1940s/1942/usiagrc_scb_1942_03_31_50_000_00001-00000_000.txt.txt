‘More War Effort
Needed’--Stevens

Cites 'Blood
Banks' 01" “
Easiern Schools

By Catherine Funk

Glinnell students must take
a more active part in the na-
tional war effort if they are
to keep pace with the condlv
tions they will find when they
enter military llfe.

This is the opinion of Pres.
Samuel N. Stevens, expressed in
a chapel talk this morning, fol-
lowing his retuin from a ton
weeks trip in eastern United
states.

Ta Mobilize All.

Reporting on his conferences
with authorities in the War and
Navy departments and officials of
the wartime boards. Dr. Stevens
said plans are being formed to
mobilize all the man power.of the
nation. This will have personal
effect on both men and women
students of the college, he said.

Deferments previously granted
will be cancelled. and men will
find themselves in the amny first,
to be classified for type of Sara
vice after their induction. The
ume for actual mobilization of
women for national service is
coming nearer. he stated.
Incrmso Student Work.

“Work by students still on
campus must be increased," Dr.
Stevens said. “Besides our initial
duty to do the best we can in

our everyday activities and stud
ies. we must undertake a tangi—
blc project to help the current
ertoit. Eastem schools have es-
tablished blood banks. navy rec
lief agencies, and systematic pro-
grams for purchase of defense
stamps in proportion to their al-
lowance or income."

“We must look upon the main—
tenance of a high scholastic and
moral record as a patriotic duty."
he said.

No M tary School.

crinnell men will find no handi-
cap in having attended a non-
' ' my school. according to Army
als. Records of officer pro-
motions show a ratio of 15-1 for
college over non-college men.
while men with previous military
training rank only '8-1 over liberal
arts graduates.
