To Develop Squad

Track practice for the spring
season began today, accord—
ing to Go Lester Duke, track
coach The first three weeks
of practice before and during ex-
aminations will be made up large-
ly of conditioning exerciscs, the
athletic drill and hard work be—
ginning soon after examinations.

”The important thing,” Duke
said, "is that we need a number
of recruits tor the track squad.
With enough men out, we should
be able to develop a good track
team."

while Robert Leitner,
Nowell, and Robert
promise to develop into good
hurdlers, Duke indicated. Grant
is the only weight man on the
squad. Notaro is the only sprint-
er returning, the field being es»
pecially open in this activity.
May Out Some Trips.

No competition will be sched-
uled until late in February, Al-
though it is possible that the
number of trips may be out down,
a complete schedule will be ar-
ranged,

Duke pointed out that this
would be an especially good year
for interested men to make the
track team. Those who possess
potential ability for many track
activities often are not aware of
the fact until they try out, he
said

He also stressed the point that
track participation excuses men
from the new conditioning exer»
cises, the sport being one of the
best conditioners in itself,
