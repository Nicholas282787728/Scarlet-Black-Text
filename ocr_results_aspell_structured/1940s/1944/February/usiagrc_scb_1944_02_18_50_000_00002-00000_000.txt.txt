It appears that Roosevelt is Gl'innell’s man
for ‘44, or so the recent straw vote would
indicate. While the results of that pseudor

, election are interesting in themselves, even
more interesting would be a tabulation of the
reasons behind this, as behind all expres—
sions of public opinion.

Do Grinnell students vote out of party loyr
alty, 01' from an honest evaluation of the is-
sues of the day and the lespective solutions
offeled by candidates, 01 because their un-
cle Ralph had a job as a second class post-
master under a Republican administration?
We wish we knellu We wish we knew why
all Americans vote as they do, because only
with an understanding of the petty deter:
minels of citizenship’s greatest plivilege,
can he hope to calry out that duty and privr
ilege more wisely oulselves, and to help oth-
ers to do the same.

This election of 1944 is not going to be
mere peanuts, It is the most important
election of our national history, and God
help us if we stumble blindly into it, because
then _110 one else can. More tllan ever be-
fore 11; is vital that an honest evaluation of
the real problems and issues be our only mo—
tivation in voting, because this is one elec-
tion fo1 which ‘life and death’, nationally
speaking, is not too nild a subtitle

One can be sure that both major palties
will recognize the major issues of today,
the winning of the 11a1a11d the 11in11ing and
insurance of the peace. For peace, we are
not going to differ on the ends to be achiev—
ed. The field of dispute will be ill the sug»
gested means for attaining these ends

The Scarlet and Black holds no brief for
any of the probable candidates as pelsonalir
ties Nor does it champion any pal'ticulal
platform But we 11ould consider our edi-
tolial existence supremely justified if he
could engender, only among those oi the stu-
dent body who will shortly be voting f01 the
first time, a sense of lesponsibility fo1 their
single ballot and 11l1at it means.

Whether we are, as individuals. Republi-
cans, Democrats, Thomas Socialists or Bron»
del Communists, we are all, today c0 signr
ers so to speak, of certain committments
made 111 our name by our government These

illclude cooperation with and aid to our an.‘
nounced allies, not only for the duration of
the wz ', but in the period thereafter. If we
choose any leader whose program is to with-
draw from that committment either partially
01' in full then we will, in the eyes of those
allies, be guilty of betrayal of a national
promise.

Secondly, we as a people have subscribed
to certain highesounding pledges for the sen
clll'i’ty and happiness of the general world
populace when the war is over. If we didn’t
mean those promises in the first place, or
if i now that the day of activating them is
approaching — ‘e begin to realize that the
bill for such a desirable state of affairs is not
going to be cheap — that is too bad. Too
bad because this is not the time to e ercise
influence alld pressure on our leadels the
committments made. And we are going to
have to come through, or lose forever the pow
sition of leadership and respect which the
United States has come to regard almost as
her birthright

Thirdly, we have spent, are spending, and1
(.to carry out our committments) are goingl
to have to continue to spend, amounts oi
money completely beyond the apprisal of
the average human mind. In the aggregate,1
such sums are so big as to lose their individ-
llal applicability. In the individual contri-
bution, however, these sums are going to be
quite tangible to every one of us i tangible
because they will hit us where it hurts most
— in the pocketbook. And the thing to re,
member about the cost of war is just this:
it can’t be avoided. No man and no party
can promise the American people to win the
war and win the peace on a balanced budget
economy and at the same time subscribe to
a program of reduced taxes! Academically
speakin we have to make up our mind}
whether we are going to have deficit econr
omy now or a defi it future later. Practir
cally speaking, the die is alreadvcast: no one.
we hope, is going to suggest we give up the
war to save the income tax. No one wants
to suggest it, if he is worthy of the right
to be one of those American voters to whom,
we address these comments, l

But at the same time, if he is worthy of
his citizenship, he will recognize that these
