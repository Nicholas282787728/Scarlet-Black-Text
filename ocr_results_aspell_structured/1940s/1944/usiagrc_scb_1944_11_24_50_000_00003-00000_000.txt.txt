Isaiah Theme for Scherer’s Gates Lectures

Glory of God
S+ressed By
Dr. Scherer

By Staff

Dr. Paul E. Schei-er, pastor of
the Evangelical Lutheran church
of the Holy Trinity in New York
City. in the first of his lectures
given Tuesday morning stated
chapters forty to fiftyrfwe
Isaiah as his text,

Dr. Schercr said that the same
situation that confronted me
Jews of Babylon is prevalent to-

day 7 the making of God a tai -,

kite for one‘s own desire or wish-

of:

.of Cyrus of Persia is that the
Jews did not need to be convinc-
erl of God’s existence. They loo
ed at nature and history as ex-
amples of God's purpose; while
modern man tries to "find God”
by looking at facts.

“The book of nature is an amr
biguous book," he stated. “You
can read it any way you like,
Facts are not so important as
what we do with them. Doxl’L inr
terpret God with facts, inter-
prct facts with GotL"

Divine Wisdom

By too great a dependence on
nature, Dr. Scherer said, man,
with his scientific explanation 0[
creation, has begun to make
certain assumptions and treat
them as it they were dogma.

The divine wisdom of God,

 

as He stressed three tacts: Chelimpelled by his love for man, is
Bible is the revelation of God, gradually realized in history, but
and if we go to it for any; man's freedom is a hindrance to

thing else, we are misleading our-
selves; the Bible starts with God,
and so must religion if it's going
to stand right-side up. 7 it can't
be based on oneself or on other
people; and that God is beyond
us 7 we can‘t victimiac him with
wits.

Second Topic "History”

In the second of his lectures a
Scherer told the audience to

Dr
”Come at history ivith the will
of a righteous God in the fore-
front of your minds."

He said that the essential dif-
ference between the modern ate
titudc toward religion and the
attitude of the Jews who were
captive in Babylon at the time

“Wars warn us that we can

enunciated, going on to denounce

race prejudice and a harsh
peace settlement as counter to
the will of God.

God's Ewnml Purpose

The third lecture also stressed
that the story of human life is
set within the all embracing Cil-r
old of God's eternal purpose Yet
most of us care very little about

something as catastrophic as the
sinking of the Titanic makes us
realize that there is a mighty
mind at work oehind everything,

To a true Christian, the advent
of Jesus Chriut should be the
lonly thought about the divine

purpose 7 for He is the beglllr
ning and the end of all our
thought. Christ is important for

where He stands now, not where
He came in history. His life. in

further pursuit of God’s pur-
pose, was not to make things
pleasant for us, not to answer
names, not to establish the su-
per ty of the white man. God
was, and is, intent on establish-
ing His sovereignty over the en-
tire world, making calm out of
chaos.

 

Isaiah In Handel

The poet of isaiah saw through
the calamity of the times the
Purpose of God, the
same spirit caught by Handel in
the pulse of his great “Messiah";
music, “Comfort ye, comfort ye-
iny people. . . Confronting
the fulfillment of the Divine Pure
pose are the paradox of human}
nature and the paradox of God's,
nature. In the first instance,l
man himself is but God's raw
material. In the second iii-
stance, we try to think thatl
since God's justice is tempered
with mei; y, that He will let up
where we are concerned, that
His mercy will dilute His jus-

rigors of Gpd’s justice. To add

these two l’poradoxcs is not a
pretty eight but it Is the prob-‘
lem of redemption it is one,
of the nature of man and [My
nature of God. ,

The topic of Dr, Scherer‘s
fourth lecture was “The Divine}
Purpose.” He spoke of salva-
tion and how Christ came to
show us the way and to make it
possible for man to save him-l
self. He went on to emphasize
the fact that religion is not a
burden or a milestone around
our necks but a yoke to make
the going easier. Man has a
tendency to give God the same

characteristics as himself, buti

God’s Plan .

Although the Bible is a reve-
lation of God and not of man,
the place of man in the divine

scheme is not to be underesti-
mated. “Without man, there
would be no history. Man is

at the center of God's plan."
The Jews seem to be the cen-

ter of history. The Bible, the
prophets, the whole basis of
Christianity, is Jewish. The last!

of the great Jewish prophets is,‘

the Christian divinityr Because
of this, the Jews are caued God's
chosen people. However, God
chose the Jews as a tool for re-
ligion, as the Romans were a}
tool for law and the Greeks fori
philosophy. In this capacity. the
Jews have pertormed a service
unique and indispensable for
God,

Religion does not exist solely
for hope and comfort , "If noth.
ing is done with it, God is done
with it.” Being chosen is a ter-
rible burden. The Jews were

chosen not for their sake but mm

to the chosen people and now to
all of Christianity had and has
three phases. l

First, He shows to the world!
the opportunity for newness of
life. Secondly, religion is crass
tive. Christianity is to provide
an outlet for the deep human de-
sire to make things. One of
the greatest joys in life is

mand to the Jews to bear glad
witness to all that had happened,
He wished them to spread his
word to all ends of the earth.
Leading a good life is obeying
the will of Cod, but the greatest
is to spread
the concept of His glory.
