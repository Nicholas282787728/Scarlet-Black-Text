crop of available \Vomanpower.

over two thousand offers of positions for young women,
not counting bids for domestic help, All this large-scale
commercial wooing is apart from the patriotic appeals
from uniformed services, farm labor groups, or war plants

“Young feet need have no
fear of weary tramping of
the streets these days in
search of an honest wage
and a worthy job.”

These lines compose the open»
ing paragraphs of an article env
titled “\th a Job? Watch Your
Step." by Louise Paine Benjamin
heauty editor of the Ladies Home
Journal. Hei- discussion of ion
prospects for high school and par-
ticulm'ly college graduates this
year appeared in the May, 1944
issue of the Journal. . .

Excerpts from the article are
reprinted here because the edir
tors of the Ladies Home Joux'v
rial, from whom it was received
and of the Scarlet and Black feel
it will be of value in shaping
ideas and attitudes of potential
career women.

“The girl who expects to make
work a part of the pattern oi
her life for an indefinite period
must look past the temptations
of easy money and unusually ex-
citing environment
where she would like to be
five years.

Reputationil’ast, Future

”Here are several questions that
every business newcomer would
do well to ask herself in consid~
ering her first position: ‘15 this
opening with a company that
stands well in its field? Is it a
:ompany with a past—or-a lu»
turn? Is there in it a possihility
for the kind of a job 1 would like
to have in time?’

it is more important to get a
foothold in a good organization
with future possibilities than to
start off With airs in a position

offers an opportunity of getting
some specialized experience, that
will have future resale value
elsewhere, it might be _well to
take it for a limited period. as
one takes an extra course of stu»
dy or seizes an opportunity to
