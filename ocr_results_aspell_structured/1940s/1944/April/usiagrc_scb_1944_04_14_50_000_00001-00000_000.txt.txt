Appleby, assls‘mllt to the
director of the national bud-
get, pointed out that the
lpost—wai- world will be a re-
sult of compromise and that
too strong an allegiance to
any particular postwar
Scheme at this time will en-
danger our ability as indi—
viduals and as a nation to
achieve a sensible compro-
mise later,

and I do not have a plan of my
own. Let us face the fact that
it is not what we want, but what
we will get, that is of real impart-
ance. I am for what we will get
in the way of a post-war arrange-
inent—-no matter what it isifm
it is either that or nothing. And
at this moment we are in real
'danger of getting nothing."

Inclusion of China

The nucleus for the post-war ar-
rangemcnt will be Russia, the
United Kingdom. the United
States, and China, in his opinion
lThe presence of the last state is
imperative Appleby stated, not
only to recognize China’s contri-
bution to this war, but also to
serve as a bulwark against the
resurgence of race antagonism
following the war.

In an inf mal question period
following his opening remarks
Appleby discussed some of the
aspects of rehabilitation and To»
lief programs. with which he has
become associated as the Ame.
ican delegate on the Interim coin-
mittec formed following the Hot

ply for the poscu-ar period.

He pointed out that the real
problem of feeding the millions
of will-starved refugees is not in
the amount but in the kind of
food needed. The world grain
supply is ample for providing
mcre food, but the dcprivstiorn
of war will require particularly
large amounts of protein foods
which are the most scaice. most
expensive, and most difficult to
transport.

Postewiir Rationing

“The success of the postrwal
rehabilitation and relief program
depends in great degree upon the
amount of rationing to which the
American pcople will submit fol-
lowing the restoration of peace,”
he said.

Again in connection with

 

the

Appleby Advises Caution in
:Pla—nning Post- War World

Allegiance fo Specific Plan
Mars Abi li’ry fo Coopera’re

“The scope and effecctiveliess of any post war arlangemell’t
cannot and should llol; be prophesied 01 planned at this
time,” said Paul Appleby, Glillliell ’13, ill on infolmdl lec—
ture in the quad drawing room last night.

food problem, Appleby cited the
key position of shipping in and
after the war. “There is no ‘cul'-
rency' comparable to shipping,"
he stated. One of the great
wastes of the war is in the
amount of shipping tonnage wast-
ed when supply vessels return
empty from various war fronts
or filled only with comparatively
useless items such as rubble from
bombed London—which was used
to pave streets in New York.

“American ships taking supplies
to Australia and New zealand are
returning empty because the
American people frown upon the
importation of meat and wool
while English ships are sailing
empty to Australia and New Zea-
land in order to return laden
with those various products," he
said in illustration.

The ideal solution to the prob-
lem would be the importation of
Australian wool and meat into
America on the Pacific coast so
that American supplies could be
sent over the Atlantic to Eng—
land 7 saving tonage, time and
ultimately lives.

Public Sentiment Respected

The failure on the part of war
leaders to adopt such a solution
is conclusive evidence that the
attitude and desires of the pub»
lic are carefully observed and re-
spected by the bureaucrats. de-
spite criticism to the contrary, he
said.

It is apparent that the Amer
ican people, probably through a
misunderstanding of the motive
of such a program, would object
and in the face of such public
feeling it is not done. Appleby
pointed out that coffee rationing
which met with serious public dise
approval, was dispensed with at
a time when ships to carry coffee
could not really be spared from
and that
the relaxation of the sugar ration
ing program. calling for a simi-
lar sacrifice of ships, was also
done because it seemed to be a
move required by the public.

“The bureaucrats are perhaps

lmore smtsihle of and amendable

to the expressed opinion of the
public than that public apprect
ates."
Publicity Ncedcd

Revicwmg the general scope of
governmental activities in war
Appleby said that the greatest
need today is for a successful
program of informing the public
of the requirements of Victory
He agreed with a questioner that
the American people are capable
of fully amount of personal sac-
rifice if and when they are perv
suaded that their sacrifice has a
definite bearing on the welfare
of this nation and her allies, but
that such a program of dispens-
ing information has never been
successfully organized.
