The 23 suggestions, as they will
be submitted for {mail approval
follow:

1. The need for more active
participation by the faculty in
student extracurricular and so-
cial affairs. This does not imply
any lessening of student pariicl»
pation in College government, but

does recognize the need tor facul-
ty assistance in program male
ing.
2. The immediate study of ur-
gent problems now confronting
the Scarlet and Black and the
women's journalistic organizer
tions. The Committee believes
that the Scarlet and Black should
be published regularly at least
once a week. and that it should
have active faculty sponsorship
3, The study, of the program
of war sciyice courses This stu-
dy should include revising the
basis of granting excuses to mus
sic and science majors. employed
students. and low grade students
4. The need to preserve intact
‘the social fee and the semester
fee, but to suspend the Gadabouts
program unless a. large enough
military unit is on the campus tc
support weekly informal dances
5. A supplementing of the us-
ual dance program by numerous
intormsl faculty-student affairs
including joint Saturday night
parties, college dramatic pertoi-m-
ances, and amateur “stunt nights}
6. The urgent need for o stur
dent center in one of tlie conege
houses on or near Park Street.

7. A revival of the former pro-
gram of faculty-student guests in
the Quadrangle dining room. This
should include again provision for
faculty sponsorship of language
tables.

3. The development of more
social life within each dormitory:
for example, Sunday night teas.
after- inner coffee hours, Satur-
day night bridge parties.

9. The reorganization of a sep-
arate lecture committee.

10. The organizing of a spring
conference to be sponsored large-
ly by students but to an appropri»
ate extent by faculty members.
The conference might be on post-
war planning, international rela-
tions. the fine arts in war time
war-time vocations, or marriage
and family relationships.

11. The bringing to the cam-
pus of a large number or interr
estlng guest speakers to meet

18. The dei-elopment of active
cooperation between students and

the maintenance and housekeeping}

departments to organize a came
paign for improving the appear
once of the campus itself. Stun
dents should be encouraged to pick
up paper (or not throw it on the
ground), to avoid making tracks
across the campus in muddy
weather (for example, the path
now being worn from Mears tr
Magoun Hall). and in many other
ways to supplement the labor
shortage which is limiting out
door work on the campus

est possible opportunity oi horse-
back riding as a college renew

ties for participation in radio'
