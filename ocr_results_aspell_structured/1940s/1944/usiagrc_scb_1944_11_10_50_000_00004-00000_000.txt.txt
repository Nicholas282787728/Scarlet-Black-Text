Grinnell college has decided that
at least it's as famous as e mov-
ie star.

You're always reading of post-
cards addressed simply “Jack
Benny" or “Ingrid Bergman.”
They get delivered.

Last week a faculty member
,at the college had occasion to ore
lder some radio scripts from Los
Angeles. They were in his post-
office box yesterday.

The address? There was none;
simply the pencil—notation for
someone who did NQT make a
label: “Grim-tell”!

Expression of
Student Ideas

Encouraged

What do students think about
the present chapel arrange
ments? Would they prefer
an occasional chapel service
instead of the present weekly
one‘.7 How would a fifteen-
minute program daily suit
them? Or should a chapel
service during the week be
abolished altogether?

These questions were raised by
Dean Earl D. Strong in an Inter
view Wednesday as he remarked
that chapel attendance last week
was 34 faculty members and 26
students. Mr. Strong said that
a religious service is intended to
fulfill the needs of the students.
If attendance indicates that the
present arrangements do not sat-
isfy student needs, a change
should be made.

“It's hardly worth an hour a
week if students don‘t come," Mr.
Strong said, “and it is embarasse
ing to invite out-of-town speak-
ers when no one comes to hear

them."

He suggested that since a re
ligious objective has become part
of the college requirements, the
chapel hour might be used for
some type of general religious in-
struction such as Bible study. He
urged students to think about
what kind of weekly program
they would like to attend and'

to express their ideas so that the
administration will know whether:
a change is in order.

Church to Offer '

Student Position

The Personnel office announces
that there has been a request
from the Congregational church
at Oskaloosa for a Grinnell stu-
dent to work with the church as
religious education director. A
paid Sunday job, this position is
open to both men and women
students.

It would be an excellent oppore
tunity for some Grinnell student
who is interested in gaining ex-
perience in that kind of work
while still in school, Such ex—
perience would be valuable for
students interested in any kind
of social service work whether
or not they plan to do religious
work as a vocation. Students
who are interested should get
in touch with Mr. George Lovell
