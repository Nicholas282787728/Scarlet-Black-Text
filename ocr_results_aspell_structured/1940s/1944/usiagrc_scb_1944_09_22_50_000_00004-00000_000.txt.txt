Geo. Lovell Replaces Nichols; Offers Jobs

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Although the problem of filling teaching positions is the
most pressing one facing the college placement office.
many kinds of jobs are available for Grillnellians who wish
to take advantage of the service, announced Mr. George
Lovell, assistant professor of psychology. Mr, Lovell re-
places Albert Nichols as acting head of the placement ofe
fice, as well as of the testing bureau and counseling

service.

“Not a day goes by that the
placement -orfice does not get
one or more requests for teoclr
ets,” Mr. Lovell said “I expect
the present shortage o‘t teachers
to continue through this year
and probably the next, so that
there will be plenty of opportunity
for people to get good jobs in
teaching next year."

He added that men are needed
to coach athletics and teach indus~
trial arts; while other positions
in elementary and secondary ede
ucation may be filled by either
men or women.

Liberal Education Desired

“In addition to the teaching
jobs,” Mr. Lovell continued, “we
have been receiving requests for
people with exactly the kind of
education we give at Grinnell.
For example, a big automobile
corporation asked for a librarian,
not necessarily trained in library
work, but someone With a liberal
arts education."

Describing the student and
alumni file kept by the placement
oftice, Mr. Lovell said that the
bureau recently sent employment
credentials to a graduate of the
class or 1923.

New Counselors

Mr, Lovell. speaking as head of
the counseling service, listed the
following new counselors: Mr.
Frederick Baumann, Mr. John
Butchart, Mr. Joseph Charlton,
Dean Earl Strong, Miss Sarah
MacDonald, Mr. R. B. McClenon.
and Mr. Leo Sherman.

”The personnel office is glad
to have the senior members of
the faculty join the counseling
Staff," Mr. Lovell stated.
