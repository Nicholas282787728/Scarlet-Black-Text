The Un-Learned Profession
An Editorial in Pathfinder

The morning papers report that the judge

\ of tlle Sixth U. S. Circuit Court of A)-
peals, one Charles C. Simons of Detl'Olt,
has just handed down all opillion denying
a contention that newspaper reporters are
“professional workers." It was his answer
to an appeal made by the publishers of
the Jackson (Tenn) Sun against the Fair
Labor Standards Act, ill which the news,
paper’s publishers averred that reporters
are “professional employees.”

We have no gripe about Judge Simons'
decision. We have a very definite gripe
about two of the sentences contained in
that decision. He said, flatly and coldly,
“Newspaper reporters have not generally
been recognized as members of the learned
professions. . . . We know of no State that
requires of (reporters) an examination for
competency or a license to practice," etc.

Can it be possible that the good Justice
is concluding that a state license or exam,
ination is the only standard by which a
profession can be distinguished from a
mere ”job?” Have we come to a point
where a $10 license fee and a goatskin
signed by a State is an emblem of nobility
in our social structure?

We will admit, as a newspap ‘lle'
of long standingI that we are mif ed by
His Hollor‘s crack about the “let *ned pro-
fessions" It recalls a stuffy stateeof-rnind
described by an old newsVllack named Sin-
clair Lewis, in a book called ”Babbitt.”

This world, learned Mr. Justice, owes:

a great deal to newspaper reporters An
English newsrhack named Charles Dickens
succeeded, without a license, in raising hob
with child labor practices a century ago . l
and started modern labor laws on their
way. Another hack named Mark Twain
has brightened the American soul for three
generations, and set standards of pleasant
living that few court decisions have
achieved, The roll-call is long, leamed Mr.
Justice “Unprofessioual” reporters like
Charles Dana, Horace Greeley, Thurlow
Weed, Grover Cleveland. To say nothing
of the un-learned newsboy, Thomas Edison,

No, reporters are not of the ”learned
professions.” They are too busy searching
out facts, . . too heckled by the COllil'ﬂdiCr‘
tory assertions of the “licensed" and 'the
"learned.” They are dismissed, mercilessly,
when they make mistakes, Licenses could
not save them, then. They are idealists,
by conviction, ill a world that seems dead-
set against idealism, They are issy, forth,
right people in all age that hm too many
licenses, too lnany examiners, too many
“learned prfessions.”

How About it? - -

(The i'ollo 'ng editorial is reprinted by spe‘
cial request llom the Feb. 26, 1943, issue of
the Scarlet and Black).

As a consequence of an editorial in the'
Scarlet and Black earlier this year, the Stu-
dent Council addressed a letter to the faculty‘
committee approving the idea set forth ill
these columns, namely the giving of a week‘s
notice for all hour-examinations by faculty
members.

Previously the faculty committee has told
the council that it would consider all coulr
cil suggestions, and would like the council
to treat faculty measures witll equal consid-
eration. This was agreeable to both bodies.
Now certaill members of the faculty are giv-
ing hour tests with absolutely no warning—-
not even a day,

It appears that the faculty committee in-
serted a condition illto the Council recomr
mendation — a big condition, Namely, that
the professor would announce the hour test
IF IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR THE PRO-
FESSOR TO DO SO. That clause nullifies
ally actioll the Student Council wished taken.

If an agreement was made between the
two bodies to consider each other‘s propos
als, that understanding should stand fast
If the faculty committee did not approve of
the advance notice, it should have said so
when the issue first arose. It is extremely
easy for a teacher to say that it was not
‘collvenient’ for him to announce a test un-
til the day he wanted to give i

If the two bodies wish to cooperate in the
future, agreement should be reached on the
past issue or the purpose of a student gov-
ernment 7 harmonious interaction between
students and faculty 7 ceases to be fulfilled

How about it faculty?

And again, one year later, we say: Yea,
verily, and fol-sooth, faculty HOW
