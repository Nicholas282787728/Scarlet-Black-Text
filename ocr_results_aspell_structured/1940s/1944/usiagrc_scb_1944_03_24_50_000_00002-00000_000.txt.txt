An All-ou+ Eﬁiﬁ. -

Ill four years' experience at Grinnell, this
writer has witnessed lnally extreme
changes in student attitude, Never has
there been such a notable difference from
one year to the next as we’ve witnessed

ill the last few weeks, culminating with
the women‘s fiance intramural Saturday
night.

The enthusiasm, the cooperation, and
the honest hard work of everyone con,
cerned was evident and, intangibly at least,
remunerative. The apathetic attitude, lac
beled “We-gottavdo-this m let's—get-it-ovelu
with, was nowhere to be found. 01' course,
there were a few who always had excuses
from dance practice, but they managed
somehow to become a part of the whole at
the eleventh hour, and with that should
go some credit. Generally there was little
balking. So much for the preliminaries,

The final production was so close to
being professional, it was almost unbelievr
able. There wasn’t a flaw, What’s more,
every member of every cottage recognized
and applauded the winner. There was no
doubt, and there we' no hard feelings.

Last year’s up sing against the per
formance and its ultimate result—2i staid,
half-finished production—deserve only a
line here for the mere purpose of contrast.

A reason for such a radical difference
is apparent. There wasn't so much disc
traction from outside sources, Perhaps the
dance intramural was sought as an escape.
At' any rate, when things got rolling, it
was found to be “not so bad after all"?
in fact, it far exceeded ,mauy expectations.
No one can deny that it was a lot of fun.
And its remuneration goes even deeper

iUnbidden Guest - -

lAll year we hardy Souls wllo have been
enduring on the Grinuell l'l'ont, have
walked bravely, heads up, looliing beyond
the bleak war landscape, and dreaming of
the bright tomorrow.

We’ve watched changes come to our be-
loved institution. 0, the changes! Many,
many And evell when it hurt to see some
01' otil favorite functions go by the board,l
we have thought' it is little enough to do.l
We can take it . . . or rather we can get‘
along without it.

And we have got along. \l'
noble, ill a nicely restrained way.

So what happens? So along comes 3”,,
other Gl'innell institution, tradition, habit‘
or what have you. We love this particulal"
thing about Grillllell, we always have,‘ Ill
‘ the past we have rejoiced when the time
l‘ol~ it came along, and we have remeillhercdi
it most when we were away from Grillnell.‘
We have never known a year to go by
without its celebration, and we have been
glad.

Except now.

Except this year.

Except this year right here right now
the way things are.

It’s coming back again, and we don’t
want it. Or at least we can’t take it. Food
rationing we have endured; with travel re-l
stl'lctions we have cooperated; the expire.
ation of clubs alld organizations we havei
witnessed with only a slight tremor of,»
nether lip. i‘

But this one thing we don’t want for
the duration—this one thing we can‘t stop,

And what are we going to do? How,
are we going to protect ourselves against,
its insidious influences? And once under
those influences, what, what WHAT are
we going to do? 27 17 7

God with us, spring is coming. All over.
All at once. There are even sunbeams in
the library.

It is the end. We are undone. Our
nerves, frayed with war tension, taut withi
overwork, shaky from the shortage of
vitamin B, can take no more.

Tomorrow we are going to buy some
snow-colored glasses; we are going to cover
the scent of mayi’lowers with vaporrub,
and to the first person to discover with
naive glee that 'Love’ rhymes with ‘above'
—death by slow, slow torture.

OPEN FORUM

We don't want to sound defen-
sive We don't want a battle of
words or even a skirmish, We re-
alize that the s and B is a little
hard up for
present and we are pretty obvious
targets. However, the editorial
criticizing certain dining room
practices failed to take into ac-
count 3 great many facts that
we would like to have pointed out
before we are condemned.

In the first place we have a
tough job. We aren't complains

ling. Most of us prefer it to any

other job on the campus because
we like working together and
we too like the dining room at»

trays, emptying ash trays, crum-
ing tables. and putting the bomb

container for hog consumption are
not exactly pleasant tasks.

One of our fcw compensations
is an extra dessert now and then

Notice we say now and then. our
extra dessert is the pudding you
turned your nose up at, or the pie
you pushed to the center of the

Finally, on our list of chic

snood combination, ”Bergie's” very
petitie and unique black velvet
and Katie Loom’s dink with the
bows and scquinned veil.

All in all, looking back (the
climate permitting) wouldn't you
agree with me that Grinnell has
an extremely ‘smart‘ group of
gals? And we've got brains, tool

thing else we eat, We are serv-
sd last. We watch while you take
your plates and start to eat. Then
we bring in coffee pots, fill water
pitchers, attend to any late com-
el's. Then we may eat. If there
is a lot left over, we may have
seconds. if there isn't we are the
ones who are stuck. Last sun-
day whileryou ate steak We had
Saturday's left-over pork chops
and roast beef from heaven knows

As for eating at another time
when would you suggest? Last
was possible. There
were enough waiters and wait-
clear
quickly. This year the dining
room is no longer the best place
around to get a date . . . resultv
ifewer willing Workers. So those
of us who can take it have to
work longer and harder. With
cafeteria service our spare time
comes during the meal. When
would be a more logical time to
eat?

We don't get to work any old
time We get around to it, or stay
out past hours to write a few
more headlines. We don’t do desk
work or brain work. We're just
laborers and we need our jobs
one advantage 7—, an extra vita-
min or two.

Close-fitting Cheese

The piospective student at the
corner table in the dining room
choked on her coffee It sound-
ed just llke thc COLLEGE STU-
DENT at the head of the table
Said she was a potato. To make
it worse, another observed that
her cheese didn‘t fit very well.

The prospective student had
learned to expcct almost any
thing in her day in Grinnell, but
this seemed beyond the realms
of even the distorted Grinnell
sense of humor. Timidly the p
s asked the COLLEGE STUDENT
pist hoiv she could be a potato
and for an answer received a delr
iigc of invitations to "come to
the gym tonight and see."

At eight o'clock the p. s. and
convoy arrived at the gym. It
was pitch dark. Oh boy, thought
the p, s., I’ve heard about col-
lege. Just then some lights came

on, to the p. s.’s disappointment and Wasn't s College

Strange. In one end of the gym
was the Rec room she had visited
the night before. The p. s. blink-

Pretty soon the lights went on
again and everyone sang and
then someone made an announce
ment. It appeared that all this
had been some sort of contest
that had been won by Cleveland.
and the p. s. thought all the time
shc was in Iowa.

As she dozed to sleep that
night in Meal-s guest room the
prospcetivc student resolved to
come to Grinnell. Where else
could one grow potatoes that big

Then she noticed something very wonderful?
