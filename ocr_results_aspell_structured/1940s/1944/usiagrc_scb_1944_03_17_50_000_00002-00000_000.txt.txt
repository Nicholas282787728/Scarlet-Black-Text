This isn’t the first plea we've made toward
this objective, but it's probably the last that
could have any effect, a 131'IOXL
meets Monday to decide the fate of the sen~
iors in regard to the date for comprehensive
examinations, We hope that the students’
views on the subject, herein set down, \\ill
be adequately considered.

Student elation over the announcement
that comprehensives would not be ndmlnlsr

tered before May 1 gives some indication .

that their reasoning is sound.

It has been noted by faculty members that
there is it general let down ill academic ef
fort towzu'd the end of the last semester if
seniors are not obliged to take filial course
examinations. To alleviate this attitude.
say proponents of the change, it is necessary
to give comprehensives a week or so before

he regular examination period, enabling-
seniors to take course finals too.

But does it not stand to reason that a dif-
fusion of effort, resulting from such a plan,
would mean less energy put J’oith toward
one goal or ai‘iother‘.7 Since professors usu~
ally lay emphasis, in the final, on the last
few weeks of study, seniors could not be ad—
equately prepared having missed one entire
week previous to the examination. A con-
centrated effort on both comprehellsives and

Students are sincere ill the hope that the

Our little meeting last week shoued us that
Grinllell is a school with its full share of
gripes, both big and little. Not to be out
done, the editors would like to take ti on
portullity to add to the general coilsteln‘
tion.

We like our dining r om, we even like the
people in it (when it i n’t just before cx-
ains). “e have nothing but praise for the
iob the Food Department has done ill the
face of rising prices, rationing stiillgellcies,
and the shortage of help. We might go so
i'ar as to say that we like the orderly at-
mosphere ol' the dining room (if we would

The thing we don’t like, the activity that
makes us cell with envy, the attitude that
ruiils a perfectly happy meal. is the attitude
‘0! the waiters when they or y off their
heaping platcs, their seconds and thiids on
desserts We could take all of that with a
smile on our faces if it were not for the at-
itltude of the waitei . When a waiter '

We realize that it has always been con-

have the best food and ill generous quail;

Let us keel) the whole thing in the spirit
of Grinllell, the spirit that dictates that all
be treated equally. Let the waiters and
waitresses eat at another time or let them

News of the Illinois Institute of
Technology: Dear Sirs. In your
March 13 issue you comment on
the effects of the war at Grin-
nell, announcing the sad fact that
only seven new students have
registered at Grinnell for the
second semester. Isn't that
tough?

We of Grinnell are deeply
touched that the name of our
humble institution should find its
way into the columns of your
paper. However somebody is
confused and it ain't us. So,
chums, let us set you straight,

The enrollment of seven new
students for the second semester
at Grinnell is an achievement. In
fact until the duration set in.
Grinnell statistics usually showed
no new students entering at the

We are happy this way.

Grinnoll is not on an accelcrr

are on a semester baSls: two
semesters :1 year, four ycars to

clinging to the “good old days”
still considers the second semester
more as the last half of the

arate term. So our acquiring as
many as seven new students is
really an accomplishment.

we have cherished our illusions.
