Why I Support Dewey - -

By Jack Hartley

I support Dewey ill the oncoming election
because I think it is time we were putting
a man into office who is capable of straight»
ening out the sadly jumbled affairs which
have been given to us by the present ad-
ministration. Democrats argue that Dewey
is inexperienced These Democrats argue
further that we need a man who has proven
himself capable of handling the affairs of
government, both domestic and foreign.
This is a crisis, they say. Unfortunately,
the nation is void of a leader who has
proven himself capable of handling our
affairs.

President Roosevelt, after nine years in
office, has had ample opportunity to put
his New Deal into effect and to draw this
country from the depression which had re-
sulted from the last war. Instead of being
out of it, statistics of the League of Na-
tions for the year 1939 show that of the
twenty-two leading industrial nations in
the world, 18 countries had succeeded bet-
ter than the U. S. ill raising their prices
and employment to the 1929 level.

Until re—armament began, the New Deal
had absolutely nothing to offer to the vast
army of unemployed millions but the W.
P. A. So far as anyone knows, he has
nothing better to offer after the war. When
Winston Churchill remarked in 1937, that
the Washington administration “is actually
at the present moment leading the world
back into the trough of depression,” he was
not making a remark that was to be for-
gotten as soon as the war had begun Your
Roosevelt supporters will argue that Roose»
velt is indispensable because he knows the
allied leaders and they place full confidence
in him.

Their only reason for cooperating with
Roosevelt is as a matter of military exped-
iency. There is no indication that they
would prefer to continue their relations on
the same basis after the war

When Franklin Roosevelt became presi-
dent in 1932, he was a “dark horse" who
entered the race and won because of a
deadlock between the two leading demo-
cratic candidates. His greatest claim to
success before this time was a none too

eventful career as governor of New York.

Tom Dewey has served New York state
in the some capacity Roosevelt did. His
success has been infinitely greater. As

Lablished one of the most brilliant records
of all time for that high position. Repub-
lican party elements *are sticking together
under the same cloak despite petty party
differences. The democrats, after the south-
ern revolt especially, can make no such
claim. Dewey is a young man, full of vision
for the future, and ready to start from
scratch. He has none of the political mis—
takes to erase that Roosevelt does.

Election of Tom Dewey means that the
American people will continue their govern-
ment as they have known it, and will ens
‘trench forever the two party system in
America.

FDR Is My Choice - -

By Virginia Foote

I support Roosevelt against Dewey because
it seems to me that Dewey’s attacks upon
the president accentuate the reasons for
electing Roosevelt. ‘

First there are the charges which are,
either completely false or deliberately mis»
leading: Dewey says that “the Roosevelt
depression" was the worst in the nation's
history. This depression began during a
Republican administration; the New Deal
was the first man-sized effort to do some-
thing about it. Dewey charges that the
administration intends to keep returned sol—
diers in the army instead of finding jobs
for them, a statement which men in the
service may have found disheartening but
which War Department announcements
have proved untrue. Dewey says that the
president left us unprepared for war and
quotes a sentellce from one of Roosevelt’s
speeches to prove it However, the entire‘
speech, from which Mr. Dewey took an,
isolated sentence, was a plea for prepared-
ness. A week ago Dewey used only half,
a sentence from a memorandum by Adolf
Berle, Assistant Secretary of State, to re-
iterate his charge that the present admin
istration is in league with the Communists»
If he had quoted the complete sentence, it‘
would have been clear that Berle’s meaning
was the exact opposite

Secondly, I object to campaign pledges
so inconsistent that they could not be car—
ried out. Most of the New Deal reforms
have been so widely accepted that Dewey
can only pledge to continue them and ad-
minister them better, while abolishing un-
pleasant government controls over state gov-
ernments, business, labor, and the farmers.
Dewey promises to reduce taxes; Bricker
promises to balance the budget, but they
promise that taxAsupported government ser-
vices will be continued.

So far I have said nothing except why I
am not in favor of Dewey. On the positive
side for Roosevelt I list his efforts to rem-V
edy the human problems involved in eco—
nomic disturbances, his just treatment of
labor, his Fair Employment Practices Com-
mittee, which takes the side of manage-
ment as well as of labor when a negro's
right to work is disputed, and his fore-
sighted international policy. While I do not,
think his record is perfect, I believe that
he will serve the interests of all people
