losing their league opener to pow-i
erful Ripon last week.

Psychology in Knox‘s Favor

.Although Siwash lost 130 sat—
urday, they will enter tomorrow's
game favored psychologically.

Knox's’ team, which is composed
of 13 returning lettermen in the
line and six in the backfield, will
be playing before a home crowd,
whereas last week's defeat was at.
Ripon, Wis.

Besides All-Conference guard,.‘
George Bahorich, Siwash will dis
play some backfield talent in Gun-
nerson at quarterback, McCoy at
right half, Underwood at fullback,
and Ted Rennacker, a 150 pound
sophomore who showed great
promise as a runner and passer
against Ripon last week.

Pioneer Team Spirit Good

However, after a_week of prep-
aration for tomorrow's encounter,
Grinnell’s general team spirit
seems to be on a high plane. Coach
cakes has stressed offensive and
defensive drills during the past|
several days, and serimmaged the

. freshman squad, who worked some
. of the Knox plays against the
varsity. .

Mel White, Bill Hooks, Jack;

fel'ence defeat, when
whipped them 13-0 under
lights Friday night. The Grin-
nt-ll attack.
the game, offered its only so
ious threat early in the first pe
iod after Carleton punted out
poorly following the kickoff,

The Pioneers picked up two
successive first downs with the
aid of a Carleton penalty. The
drive was choked off and Adude
doll made an unsuccessful at
tempt for a field goal from the
28-yd. hne. After that, Carleton
easily stopped the Crinnell
running game, giving up only
one inoie first down, that in the
second half on a pass from Eg-
gers to Dunlop.

The Carleton attack sputtered
and threatened to go off through
out the first half and most of
the third quarter until Curt
ftottke broke loose and scored
from 25 yards out, Fisher’s con-
version was good, The second
Carl touchdown followed short-
ly after coming on a long sus-

tained drive. David finally went‘

over from 8 yards out on a
smash through center.

_offensively the Carls had all
the better of the show gaining
206 yards by land and air to the

Pioneer's 53, The high spot of,

the evening for the Grinnell fans
was the Pioneers fine goalvllne
