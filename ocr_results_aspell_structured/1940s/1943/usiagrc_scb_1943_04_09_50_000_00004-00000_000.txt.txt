Campuses al War

ANN ARBOR, MichiiACPJ—
Forty basie.Univei-sity of Michi—
gan ROTC students, commanded
by three cadet officers. have mov-
ed into the bare-walled military
barracks of a student dormitor
to live under a strict military
supervision that requires special
passes even for dates.

A West Point in miniature, the
barracks were organized by Cadet
Co. Charles M, Thatcher a senior.
Purpose of the experiment, which
has received full support of Link
versity officials, is to give train-
ing far stiffer than ordinarily re-
Celvcd in ROTC.

The student soldiers have lib-
erty granted by pass only. and
to get that pass they must be
caught up on their studies and
have no demerits,

Two large rooms in the base»
mont of the East Quadrangle
dormitories house 20 men each.
Every man is supplied a bed,
chest of drawers and clothes lock-
er. A study room is situated be—
tween the sleeping quarters. The
men eat in the regular dormitory
dining rooms, although the cadet
officers, directly responsible to
Thatcher, live separately in an
adjoining room. Room rates are
$40 a semester as compared with
S75 for regular students.

OMAHA. Neb.7(ACFJ—-Some-
thing new has been added to
Creighton university's accelerated
wartime study program.

It’s a
which punishes each unexcused
absence from an academic or mili-
tary class with two hours of phy-
sical exercnse or campus work. in
the case of undergraduate coeds,
each unexcused absence brings 2L
fine, which may be worked out
in library or office work.

Explaining the new measure,
believed to be unique among Arn-
erican universities, the Very Rev.
Joseph P. Zuercher, president,
commented:

“In these war years there is
no room in college for loafers:
The armed forces have been co»
operative in the matter of per-
mitting serious-minded young men
to remain in college, with the
single View in mind of preparing
themselves adequately for future
service as officers. We intend,
on our part, to see that the stu
dents make such preparations as
adequately and as speedily as pos-
sible."
