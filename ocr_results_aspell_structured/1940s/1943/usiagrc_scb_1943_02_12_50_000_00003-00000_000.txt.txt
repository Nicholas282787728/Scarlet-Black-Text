in Washington is not exactly a
happy one. Her folks at home
fondly think she‘s getting a heavy
ta rroin sharing the spotlight
ivith big shots, growing giddy in
the whirl along embassy row, and
making big money. Those who
don't know her think she's pr-irnp-
ing on taxpayer's money. Con-
gressional growiers picture her as
a cross between a l'cliefer and a
shirtless squatter,

Actually, she's a hard worker
who has a tough time looking
trim on 51,440. She gets homer
sick more often than she'll admit.

but it’s all she has to keep her
going.

And now her moi-ale has had
three quick lirts. Congress this
ed her pay by giving her time
and a quarter for overtime she's
worked unpaid for months. A
hospitality committee has finally
started working to help her meet
service meniran important matter

men to go around. And no less
a personage than FDR has told
Congress to its- face that governs

ernment girls,
