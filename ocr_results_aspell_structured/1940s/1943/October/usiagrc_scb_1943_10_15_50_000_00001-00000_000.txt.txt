Hitler’s Future. That is an in—
tercsting topic. There are those
of us who would see Hitler drag-
ged through the streets as a
trophy of war. others feel that
a quick and efficient examination
’would be more to the point.
Before we are carried away by
the mob psychology and the
hatred that has been bred by the
war, let us examine more closely
the motives behind this desire
’for extinction. Is it, as some
claim, simply a precautionary
measure? Hitler is a genius, of
that there is no doubt. He has a
genius for handling people, espe-
cially people in the aggregate.
This ability, reason some, makes
Hitler a potential threat to the

stay in America, but she is now
on a boat on her way to Japan.
Those people are not accepted by
the Japanese ui Japan, and yet
they are not allowed to come
back to America.”

In reply to a question concerne
ing the conditions at the centers,
Miss Takahashi maintained that
the JapaneserAmel‘icalls were not
being pampered. Food was poor,
she said. and living conditions
were very had. She cited an iii-
stance in which bachelors and
single women were housed in one
room; sometimes stables which
had not been cleaned out were
used for barracks.

next Tuesday night, and the
topics under discussion will in-

To those who feel that a live

gest a look at two men, The
first, Kaiser Wilhelm, the “Wood

a picturesque refugee. The sec-

Mussolini fell because Fascism
fell. Fascism did not fall be-
cause Mussolini took a powder.
The same Will be true of Hitler.
Once the system which supports
him is gone, the man ceases to be
