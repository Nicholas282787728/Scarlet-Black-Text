Seconol Room Deposii
Will Be Used lo Repair
Damage fo Macy House

Following an inspection of
Macy house, Dibble hall last se‘-

inester, Grinnell college has tier
mended a second room deposit of
ten dollars from all men who
lived in the hall last semester, ac-
cording to duplicate letters res
ccivcd this week by the hall mem-
bers and signed by the college
treasurer.

The money from the two den
posits will be used to repair
damage to the walls and floors
of the house caused by tape and
cigarette burns, says the letter.

In addition the letter com—
plains of “rooms littered with
everything from shoes and filthy
son to cancelled bus tickets. Ev»
ery light bulb in the house was
removed and smashed on the
floors. The wells of the stair—
way , . . are fingerinarkcd and
dirty."

E. laining that the new room
deposit required this week of
nibblc men is merely a guaran—
tee that the cost of repairing the
damage to the ball will be paid
by the students responsible for
the damage. Dean Beatty said
that upon completion of the re—
pairs an itemized hill ivill he sent
to the hall, and any money left
over will be refunded to their ac—
count.

The second deposit is necessi-
tated. according to Beatty, by the
fact that several Dibble men
have already used up much of
their earlier deposit with guest
meals and petty damage charges,
he said.

The plan, approved last Tuesday

the replacement of a single stu-

to avoid the necessity of a re-

Despite Measles, War, Concert Is Success

By Blll'tis Matthews

In history we learn that an insti-
tution, in order to endure, must
be able to adapt itself to the
changes which go on about it;
and that if an institution can live
through changing times it must
be fundamentally sound.

By such reasoning it can be
seen how fundamntslly the Grin-
nell glee club is as an institution,
or what kind of sound it makes.
or something. After 48 annual
appearances, and in spite of the
war, the Army air coips and the
measles, 21 memberss of the ar—
ganization presented a short, but
very pleasing program, in Herrick
chapel Wednesday night.

Three men, called into service

with the Army air corps last
week. had returned to campus

for the concert, but this gain was
somewhat offset when another
member developed measles im—
mediately before th program.

But, th show did go on, and it
was a good one. In the first
group of songs, ”Humpty Dump
ty" was an enthusiastically renr
dered contrast to the more se '
ous ' Winter Song" and "My Na—
tive Land." Two more groups
filled out the chorus portion of
the program, including Jacobs-
Ringwatld’s "T is Is My Country,"
“Romherg’s “Stouthearted Man,"
a Herbert cut, “Tramp, Tramp,
Tramp;' and the Army, Navy,
and Marine anthems.

Ringwald's arrangement of the
last named military theme song
made it one of the finest numbers
in a concert of mosny rollicking
and patriotic seclctions.

Between th chorus groups, four

solos were very well accepted,
Guyeda Shields, glce club accom-
panist, played a piano solo, Pre-
lude in a Minor by Rachmaninoff.
Mrs. Mildred snyder Hawthorne,
violinist, accompanied by Norman
Goodhrod, pianist, performed the
second movement of a Cesar
Franck sonata. Two vocal solos
were provided by John Thompson.
tenor, and Ward Schwab, bari-
tone. Thonipsoirs “British Ch -
dren’s Prayer" and Schwab's
‘Al'morer's Song" were both rich
and effective.

J, Forrest West, director of the
club, and Dean Hess. president’,
have shown that through four-
teen men have had to leave them
since the year began, they can
still produce balanced, solid mu—
sic, and competent soloists.

woman to next year’s committee,
under the plan.

Under the order of succession
suggested, the C. of H. P. presi»
dent will succeed as chairman
if the original head is drafted;
if this lndn in turn leaves for
service. he will be'sncceeded by
the League Board president. The
chairmanship will then pass, if
necessary, to the c. of H. P..l‘ep»
rensentativaat-large. the League
Board i-epreseiitatwe-at-large, the
man appointed by the general
council of this 3 air. and the wom-
an so appointed.

The status of a general student

notion remains intact for next
year, there appears to be no ob<
jcciion to clccting honso repre-
sentatives in the usual manner.
If house arrangements are sub-
stantially changed. the sevens
member board will he the only
stndont goveining body on the
campus.

As such, it shall conform as
closely as possible to the pres
ent student council constitution
and the “status quo“ of student
government, according to Mc-
Keon. . ’

For this year at least, the com—
mittee chairman shall be elected
in the manner prescribed for the
student council tpl'esidenl. On
March 1, cottage and hail meme
hers will choose delegates for a
nominating convention and will
cast a first ballot to choose 11)
nominees for the chairmanship.
On March a, the convention will
be held, and two candidates will
be chosen from the first pane of
10. Final election will be on
Monday. March 3.

Election of the mague Board
president was last night postpon-
od until Tuesday, March 9, in
view of the possibility of a wom-
an being chosen committee chair—
man. Tho chairmanship, highest ,
ranking student office, takes pre-V
cedent over all others.

Although the League Board
president for next year will thus
be known by March 9, she will
not appear on the committee for
the rest of this year. Marlorie
Wallace, present women's self-
government head, will represent
that organization on the board
until her graduation, as will 0.
of H. P. president Howard J.
Luric.

That a new 0. of H, P. presi-
dent should not be named until
next fall. when school reopens,
has been suggested by McKeon.

The members at large appoint-
ed by the present Leaguc Board
and C. of H, P. will thus be car—
ricd over to the committee for
next year, though the heads of
these two organizations will be
changed for next fall. he said,
