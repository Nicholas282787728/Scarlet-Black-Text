Gentlemen of the Press---

Last week, in the Congress of the United
States, and by special invitation, Madame
Chiang Kai‘shek of China made a speech.
It was more than a good speech; it was a
great one, containing rousing logic and over—
powering fact.“ It was keyed, not to senti-
mentality, but to sincere sentiment, It was
not a humble speech nor a pleading one; it
was not always flattering. As solid and
blunt as only the truth can be, it was
phrased as politely as only a Chinese could
phrase it. ,

About that speech, the Des Moines
Register printed a news story and an edi-
torial. In capital letters, the news story
characterized Madame Chiang’s manner as
one of “SUBDUED HYSERIA," Editorially,
it said, ” . . . When George Washington was
president, he kicked out of the country the
ambassador of our ally, France for doing
something like what Madame Chiang Kai-
shek is doing. But then, Citizen Genet was
not the most beautiful first lady . . . ”

China’s 400 million people form our
largest single group of allies. Their repre-
sentatives should naturally profess an in:
tense interest in how this nation intends
to implement its promises as an ally. China
has already shown how she is fulfilling
hersﬁwith over six million casualties, and
five and one-half years of war.

“ . . . Japan in her occupied areas today
has greater resources at her command than
Germany . . . " Madame Chiang said. But
don’t believe just her. Look at a globe
someday; read your own news columns to
morrow; pick up a copy of Sempler’s “Geo—
graphic Factor in History."

So it appears that the worst one can
say of Madame’s speech is that it was true.
Was she suggesting that her ally change
its declared policy of beating Hitler first‘.7
Undoubtedly she would want such a change;
her nation has fought Japan since 1937.

Yet, undoubtedly there is strong evidence
against as well as for such a change. To have
faced the issue squarely and to have de-
feated it legitimately would have been the
best exercise of a newspaper’s responsibil-
ity. To condemn a speaker for having dared
to raise the issue, however, smacks suspic—
iously of the "My Country, right or wrong”
school which it was hoped had died with the
advent of daily newspapers and public educa
tion.

There are two kinds of patriotism. Blind
patriotism will suffice for short poems, 1307
litical campaigns, and class reunions. It is
our opinion that it will not suffice for Am»
erican newspapers.

If any newspaperman thinks Madame
Chiang is wrong, surely it is his duty to
say so. If the Des Moines Register‘s edi-
tors thought her arguments were faulty
and her position untenable, it was their
duty to say so. But we think that, in all
fairness to the ‘Freedom they represent,
such editors could have found condemna--
tions more concrete than Madame Chiang’s
tone of voice, manner of dress, and the fact
that she is very beautiful. ’

How About H, Fa'cul’ry"

As a consequence of an editorial in the
Scarlet and Black earlier this year, the Stu»
dent Council addressed a letter to the facv
ulty comittee approving the idea set forth
in the editorial. The Council asked the face
ulty to approve the idea that faculty mem-
bers give a week‘s notice before giVlng a
class an hour examination.

Previously the faculty committee has
told the council that they would conSlder
all Council suggestions, and would like the
Council to do likewise to theirs. This was
agreeable, to both parties. Now certain
members of the faculty are glvmg hour
tests with absolutely no warning whatso—
ever#not even a day.

It appears that the faculty committee
inserted a condition into the Council recom-
mendation—a big/condition. Namely, that
the professor would announce the hour test
IF IT WAS CONVENIENT FOR THE P307
FESSOR. That clause nullifies any action
the Student Council wished taken.

If an agreement was made between the
two bodies to consider each other’s pro-
posals, that understanding should stand fast:
If the faculty committee did not approve of
the advance notice, it should have said so
when the issue first arose. It is_ extremely
easy for a teacher to say that it was not
“convenient for him to announce a test un-
til the day he wanted to give 1t. ‘

If the two bodies wish to cooperate in
the future, agreement should be reached on
past issue or the purpose of student govern-
nlentillarmonious interaction between.stu~
dents and faculty#ceases to be fulﬁlled.

How about it, faculty?
