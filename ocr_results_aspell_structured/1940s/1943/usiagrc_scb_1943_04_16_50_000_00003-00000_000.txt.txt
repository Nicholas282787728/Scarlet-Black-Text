The Challenge:

TO MARILYN McCOOL,
PRESIDENT STUDENT
COUNCIL.

MADAM PRESIDENT:

According to the minutes of
the April 5 meeting of the
Council of House Presidents,
the council took action on
two matters that we chill-
lenge as basically unsound.

First of all, the Friars 01'-
g’dnirition was voted :1 sum
of 2d dollars “for reasons
stated to the council.“ Sec-
ondly, the council voted to
perpetuate themselves in of-
fice for the remainder of the
school year.

In regard to the first matter,
we object to the giving oi this
money, money which in reality
belongs to one hundred and
twenty-five men, to an organiza-
tion composed of five men. M .
Lurie, last semester, made aniiir
formal appeal to the student
Council for this money, and it
was denied on the grounds that
the student council funds could
not be used by any small group
where the welfare of the entire
student body was not affected.

Mr. Lurie, president‘ot Friars,
then took his request to the c.
of H. 17., iii which lie is also the
president, and was awarded the
money. The thing oi poriiouliir
importance is that the c. oi H. P.

is composed oi lire nion, lwu of
whom are nriurs and one an 01in
giblc pledge of that organization

We demand that the student
council, acting as the supreme
governing body on campus, see
to it that this matter is investi-
gated, and the money used in the
proper manner. We point out
that the League Board, compara—
ble to the c. of H. P., is pros
minted in its constitution to
make any such allotment of its
funds to the Mortar Board, oom-
parablc to the Friars.‘

NOW the second matter is
democratically inexcusable. What
right has any elected body to
perpetuate themselves in office by
its own voteithe only justificn»
ﬁlm for such action would be by
an amendment to the constitnr
non of the c. of H. r. passed by
it threerfourths Vote of the men.
The Student Councu made ”-5
changes in the right manner by
a vote of the entire student
body. Are we going to let demo-
cratic principles suffer for the
whims and lacakdalsical attitude
of a body, supposedly a thinking
body, having the interests of the
men at heart?

‘Madlun President, we dcnuind
that the Sluilcnl; Council tare
some immediate action lo rectiiy
these \iulaﬁuns of linsio demo-
orntio prino pic Remember,
there are only it weeks oi
schunl lett. You'whnied interest
in student governmenl, and here
it is. Show us whiit you ran do.

The Reply:

A letter of this ,vein was to
be written by me before I be-
came aware of lthe document
also printed in this issue. I
will answer these charges di-
rected at my integrity with
facts, not u'ild, flag'»i\'tl\iiilg',
glittering generalities.

The entire purpose behind my
first proposed letter was the
comment made by one of the
signers oi the other letter anent
the “selI-peipetllatlng body."
When asked the question iiy Mr.
Bremicker. I risked him it he
really thought we should have
had the hall elections this spring,
His answer was, “hell, noiit’s
just a technicality."

The entire purpose behind the
letter is contained in the minds
of two oi the signers, and a
third, who has not lent his mime
to the “emancipation proclnmar
lion." i will not waste rationed
newsprint, but answer those
tol'chrbeare, of liberty ior all

Allent iicm one: Let me my
this, Did these champions or
liberty who have such a regard
for iunds question the Council
of House Presidents nllotting the
Lewis Library ten dollars for
magazine covers? The Lewis
Lihc is in the quadrangle, used
ninetyrnlne per cent by women7
except for men who might take
a magazine home now and then.
Did the men object when the
Council footed part at the bill
for the dance pill: on during
freshmen week for new students.
when only o portion of Grinnell
men were hereidid these pro-
ponents of a new order demand
explanation of the appropriation
{mm the Coupcil to the Rec
Room committeeiwhich is lo-
cated in the quadrangle—that’s
where the women live, you know.

I have not heard a gripe
about our appropriation to the
War chest. The men are not
sponsoring that drive entirely.

Nny, did I hear the purgers
scream for justice when the Coun-
cil voted a refund to every
man. True, tho sum was only
ﬁlly cents—hut it lmd hocu on

The money was not there. The
student Council could not appro'
priate the money. Brother Mc-
Keoli raised no moral issue at
that time. The C. of H. P. was
the other logical place to seek
lunds. The men agreed upon
the appropriation, if some of
the signed members had dealt
with the c oi H. P., they would
know that they are not as easily
convinced oi things as people
with whom they come in con-
tact. I‘m sorry some signers

didn‘t have the faintest idea oi
