Haines Girls - —
Never!
- - Hard Up'.]

What is life like in a girls'
School? At least one group of
college women will attempt to

prove this week-end that a man-
ess evening can be something
more than an extra bit of time to
study or wash clothes.

Saturday most of the AST
men are leaving on furlough for
parts unknown. No all»college en—
tertainr‘nent has been planned for
that night. And Saturday night
Haine is giving an slhgirrbridge
party.

Instead of cr‘owding into the
local hot-spots, Haines girls will
crowd into the cottage parlor. Re-
freshments will be served and en-
tertainment provided for those

who don‘t play bridge. “Maybe
we'll even be able to afford
prizes,” said- Elizabeth Adkinsi
housechairman.

Saturday will mark Hie ﬁrst
time in Grinnell history that a
“hen party” has ever taken prec-
edence as one of the social events
of the week. Perhaps they may
become a regular wartime institu-
tion. Anyhow Haines girls are
already refusing dates to stay
home and play bridge with the
girls.

since 1925, He was appointed
Associate Dean of the Divinity
School in 1939 He has received
honorary degrees [Tom Harvard,
Yale, Brown. Williams. Colby. and
Hillsdale.

Dean Gilkey's subicct Sunday
morning will be “Redeeming Bad
Tlms.” He will be on campus
all day Sunday, giving students
an opportunity to meet him perr
sonally.

Dr. Walter Barlow, minister of
the collegiate Presbyterian church
in Ames, will speak at chapel
Thursday morning, December 9,
Dr. Everton also announced.

Dr. Barlow was born in Lan-
cashire, England, and received his
training at Manchester. He took
post graduate work in this coun-
try and received his PhD. from
the University of Dubuoue grad»
uate school in theology,

Dr. Barlow came to this coun-
try from England in 1920. Since
that time he has been dean of

puses and by organizations is di-
vided according to need; 16.5%
goes to the WSSF for educational

gees, evacuees, and internees in
programs and operating expenses:
,the U. S. and Canada; 27.6% to
American and European student
prisoners of war, and to Euro-
pean refugees, internees and evac~

The recognized channel for aid
to student prisoners of war, ops
crating under the Geneva Conven-
tion of 1929, the WSSF is inter
national, non-sectarian. and non-
political. It "builds for the fu-
ture through relief plus education
and reconstruction,"

Gleason

By Barbara Buckley
Grinnell's busiest woman un~
doubtcdly is Miss Nellie Gleason,
Food Director. Not only does she
have to cope with ration points,
shortages, and labor in the col-
lege food program, but she has
the additional problem of feeding
the army units on the campus.

To begin with, there may be
anywhere from 500—1290 men on
the campus at any given date,
250 of those men, are, of course.
here for a definite length of time,
and Miss Gleason can always
count on that number of hungry
mouths to be fed. But the STAR
Unit is another matter entirely.
The army gives notice of the
number of men to be fed,
true but only 24-48 hours
ahead of the meal. To offset the
possibilities of being caught short
on food during a heavy inﬂux of
STAR men, a backlog of supplies
is always held ready, and so far,
there has always been plenty of
food available.

There is no connection whatso-
ever between the army and the
college food programs. Miss Glea—
son stated, There are two Sep-
arate storerooms, two separate
staffs of cooks. and two separate
kitchens. The only time in which
the two programs coincide is in
the case of baking, for, since the
army has no bakery of its own
here. the college bakeshop pro-
vides all the cakes and pies need-
ed. But. aside from this instance,
Miss Gleason has to supervise
two entirely different setups.
Even the buying is done separ-
ately.

"The main aim of the Army is
to give the boys a well-balanced

 

it is’

Elm Slegmeister’s American Bal-
lard singers wul present sin eve-
ning of native American music in
Herrick Chapel on Dec. 5 at s
p. in, under the auspices of the
Grinnell Concert and Lecture scr-
ice.

The program consists of five
parts, entitled “Music of Early
America," ”Americans at Work,‘
“The Melting Pot," “American
Legends," and “Folk Songs of To-
day." ’

The singers are one of very
few groups who have discovered
and performed the little known
music which is native to our own
country. It is at once good en~
tcrtaiiiinent and humorous. judg-
ing from the interest at Iowa
State college and Iowa university,
both of which have re-eiigaged

Chorus Presents
Messiah Dec. 14

“The Messiah," by George Fred-
eric Handel, the traditional
Christmas Oratorio, will be pre-
sented December 14 in Herrick
Chapel, Army men, students, fac-
ulty and townspeople will take
part in it.

“The Messiah,” Handel’s most
successful and best known are»
torio, was composed in the year
1741 in twentyrfaur days from
August 22 to September 14. lb
was first performed at a concert
given for charitable .pumoses at
Dublin, Ireland ,on April 13, 1742,
Handel conducting the perform-
ance and a chorus of many thous»

 

and singing
Grinnell has presented “The
Messiah" annually since 1909.

This performance is now one of
the college's greatest Christmas
traditions. -

idiot,“ Miss Gleason said. In order
to insure this diet, the Quarters
master Corps headquarters in
Washington sends out a Master
Menu for all army posts, and this
menu applies to all sections of
the country. There is some ice-
way afforded, however. in the dif-
ferent localities. Posts in the
South may be able to get fresh
peas. when they are called for in
the menu; but it is permissible
for canned peas to be used in
sections of the country where
fresh vegetables are not readily
available. Miss Gleason makes up
her menus from this Master
Menu, making whatever slight
changes are necessary, but mak—
ing sure that she kccps within
th actual government rations al—
lowed to the units here on cam-
pus. The army defines the “ra-
tion” as the allowance of food
for the subsistence of one person
for one day. True. if some Sol~
diers don’t come to meals like
good little boys, there may be a
little left over, and perhaps secs
ond lielpings will be had. But the
college is not authorized to cook
any more food, even if the men
eat up with relish what they get,
All of the rations eaten have to
be recorded by Miss Gleason, and
reports are available for the mess
officer at Cowles who may check
them to see that everything is
correct.

As far as the purchase of food
is concerned. Miss Gleason says
that the army program has one
distinct advantage over the or-
dinary civilian program here at
Grinnell. There isn’t any mess
of points and coupons or ration

dividual soldier. The mess offi-
cer is responsible for signing ra-
tion checks for the purchase of
meats and fats, processed foods
and sugar. Meat is bought on a
contract according to army speci-
ficatioiis.

Miss Gleason deals with the
same wholesale supply houses in
getting both sets of supplies. but,
she says, "the Army gets its
share first; civilians get what is
left." which is as it ought to
be, we think. For instance, the
army got its turkey on Thanks-
giving, Luckily ,the college had
its order in long enough ahead so
that every student got his piece
of that festive fowl. But it just
might Iiave happened that there
wouldn't have been sufficient for
both programs.

in general the men seem to like
the food they get. Miss G. in-
forms us that they are amazed
at the variety of food that they
are served. “We try to make
their dining room as much like
home as possible," said Miss Gleav
son. And, judging from added re-
ports, the men like being at Grin.
nell College. ’

Wac Speaker

Army recruiting officers will be
in Grinnell in the near future,
with the express purpose of talk-
ing to Grinnell women about the
WAC and the new army air corps
program for Women. A definite
date has not as yet been set for
the visit, but, according to the
office of Louis v. Phelps, busi<
ness manager, the officers will be
here either December 9 or 10.
