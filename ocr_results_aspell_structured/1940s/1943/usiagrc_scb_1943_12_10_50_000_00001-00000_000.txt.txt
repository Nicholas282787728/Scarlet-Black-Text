Ballad Singer's

Program

Makes Hi’r Wi+h_Silide:l+sI

By Barbara Buckley

The American folk song, outside
of the negro spiritual, has long
been a neglected part of the con-
cert repertory. Somehow, most
artists seem to feel that it is
“low-brow" to sing any folk songs
which are not European or negro
in origin, The American Ballad
Singer-s. who gave their first
Ci-innell concert under the aus-
pices of the Concert Series, Wed-
nesday, Dec. 5. havc attempted
to restore to its proper place tlic
American folk song,

The quality of the singing in
the concert may not have been
what high brow musicians would
like: the soprano was a little too
shrill, the baritone weak. and the
tenor too harsh, But the fact re:
mains that the music they pre-
sented was real Americana, and
the audience enjoyed it.

Astually, the best singing ct tnc
evening was thc ensemble work:
but the audience had the most
fun laughing at the antics of the

soloists. who were. perhaps,
the most talented artists
have been on campus.

The program was made up of
a

songs presented seemed to

pcaled greatly to the audience
