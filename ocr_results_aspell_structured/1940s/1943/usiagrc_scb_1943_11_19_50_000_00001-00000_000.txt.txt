By Barbara Buckley

The question of the effectiveness
of using a play as a recital var
liicle is one which is highly de-
batable, Mrs. Ann Bil'lt Kupel"s
interpretation of “Harriet", pre~
scntcd by the Social Budget on
Tuesday, Nov, 16, was both the
better and the worse for the fact
that it was a play and not a
monologue.

Unfortunately, a piece whichis'

written to be played in a theater
by several different actors can—
not be wholly effective when
read by only one person, who ne—
cessarily lacks the properties, the
settings, and the possibilities for

 

action which are afforded the
stage ac‘to . Mrs Kuper has tried
to translate “Harriet" from the

medium of the stage to that of
the recital platform, and the suc-

cess of her effort is difficult to
estimate.
Mrs. Kupcrs condensation of

the play was good. She managed
to pick out only the more dra-
matic incidents. and yet at no
time did the recital lack coher-
ence. A goodly span of_, Harriet

Holds Attention

It is in great part due to Mrs
Kuper's sensitive realization of
the necessity of choosing the best
of the play for presentation, that
the audience, which was attentive
and responsive from the first, did
not become bored or restless. The
attention which was given her 's

One Fault

ELL, IOWA, NOVEMBERTI9, l94§ No. a

 

The most serious fault in Mrs.
Kuper‘s whole interpretation, then,
lies‘iiot in her acting ability,
which is obviously great, nor in
her delivery, which is as good as
any this reviewer has ever heard.
The fault lies in the artificiality
of the assumption by one person‘
of several different roles. Harr .t,
for example, was not as clearly
defined as she might otherwise
have been, for all the subtle
changes which took place in her-
character over the years were
lost when Mrs. Kupcr had to,
jump from one role to another
and assume an entirely new set _
of traits.

Again, there is n definite ar-
tificiality evident in the reading
by a woman of ii man's lines
Thus, Calvin, Harriet's husband,
emerged, in Mrs. Kuper’s charac-
terization, as a man with no 557
pecial traits whatsoever. And
only by the obvious strength of
the author’s delineation of Henry
Ward Beecher was this august
personage able to survive.

Perhaps, if Mrs. Kuper had in~
chided less material in her rcci-
tal, theeffect would have been
more impressive. Nevertheless, .it
is to her credit that she managed
to keep her audience interested
at all times, She is obviously a
very accomplished artist, for only
an accomplished artist could have
handled as whole play with such
poise and vigor.
