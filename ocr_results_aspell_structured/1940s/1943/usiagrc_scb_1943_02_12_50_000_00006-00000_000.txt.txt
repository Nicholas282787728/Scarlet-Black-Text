Grinnell college's Pioneers brought

Grinnell jumped into an early 6—0

The scarlet and black pulled out
to a 33»21 advantage soon after

Cornell edged out the Pioneers
last Saturday 45-42 in a fast,
hard-fought game. Midway in the
first half Grinnell snatched an
eight point lead only to see it
disappear at the half time after
Bowers was forced out of the
game with a sprained ankle.
Although Grinnell was never
able to overcome its one point dee
fiCit at the half, Cornell never
stretched its lead to more than
five points and the game was in
doubt until die end, With a minr
