The Midwest’s conference
track crown, which has rested
ill the Coe college trophy case
for low these four years, was
resting serenely last night,
but all indications point to the
fact that it will be traveling
to a new abode Saturday aft-
ei‘noonr

The conference field has dwindlr
ed to six colleges who will battle
it out on the Coe track Saturday
afternoon. with the spotlight shine
ing on Grinnell, Lawrence, and
Monmouth as the teams to beat.
Fieweger for Lawrence

Lawrence, which has dominated
Midwest athletics this year. can
again call on their “one man track
team” in the person of Jim Fiewe-
ger, who last year captured top
money in both hurdle races, the
broad jump, high jump, and-the
shot put at the conference cinder-
classic. It was Fieweger who set
a new Midwest record in 120 yard
high hurdles last year, when he
skimmed the timbers in 15 sec-
onds flat.

Fiewegcr ivill also be aided and

obetted by such Vilrirrgpeitoriners
as Al lepek in the polo aulL;
Wally Patten with the ioiririig;
Robert Pcl'schbacher in the two
mile, and Vi’al'rcll Buesriig iii the
weights. James Due. Gerald
Grady, and Challcs Rollins will
handle the dashes and short dis-
tance races for the blue and white.
Monmouth Team Small

Monmouth will bring a small but
dangerous aggregation to Cedar
Rapids, headed by Glen Rankin.
who riins the quarter, half, and
hurdles, and Bill Laxon, a hurdle,
sprint, and broad jump ace.

The Scots also have Tabby
Talkin in the sprints, low hurdles,
and pole vault. and Jim Pollack
in the distances,

Cornell, who might be rated as
the darkhorse of the meet, has a
sure point winner in Dave Clut-
terham, contercnce king in the dis-
tance events, and Walt Haloupclr,
varsity gridder and wrestler, in
the weights.

The' .Purple may cause consider-
able trouble in the middle distan-
ces with such athletes as Don
striiclien, Pete Solmitz, and Lowell
Reed.

Cne‘s Chances Slim

Coes defending champs seem to
be out as serious contenders, as
they have but one lotierman back
