Change Made
In Procedure

Of Elections

Definite Rules Made
By Council Regarding
Naming of Delegations

Feeling that original plans
for Student Council elections
were not quite satisfactory,
the central committee of the
student council Thursday
noon laid plans to revise the
voting procedure.

Biggest changes come in the
iiiethod of electlng’ delegates to
the convention, to be held, next
sat day afternoon. Whereas the
original plans called for no speci»
tic means of electing delegates,
new methods eliminate the uncei»
tainty of the plan.

Delegates Election Changed.

Under the revised system, at
the time of the primary balloting.
each member of the house shall
also vote for five people for dele-
gates to the nominating conven—
tion and those who receive the
highest number of votes, consti-
tuting in all, oneoiiarter of the

residents, shall be the delegates]

Immediately after their election,
the delegates are to convene to
elect a chairman of their delega-
tion.

At a followmg housemeeting, to
be held Thursday night, each per-
son in the house shall vote for
one of the ten eligible delegates,
and the chairman shall instruct
the delegates to vote according to
the total house vote received by
each of the candidates. Accord-
ing to Student Council president,
Robert C. Young, the above will
be binding to delegates in the
convention only on the first hal»
lot.

Primaries Revised.

Another major change in the
system is that studenm on Mona
day night will vote for only two
candidates in thc primary elec-
tion rather than five, as had been
previously announced by the Stu»
dept Council.

Young also said that the cen—
tral committee of the council had
voted to change the 33 per cent
of the convention votes needed
by two candidates simultaneously
to 35 per cent, therefore eliminat-
ing all possible chance of have
ing three men running for office
after the convention.

New Public Affairs Club Formed

To Increase Topics For Discussion

Combining the International Rela—
tions club, the Young Republicans,
and Young Democrats on campus,
the Jesse Macy Public Affairs

three groups, providing a single
discussion meeting for social
science majors in which problems

debate will be offered by the pub-
lic affairs organization.

ference are not definite as yet,

and it may be postponed until
the spring of 1942, Bridgham said.

ulty members from the social

as“ndvisers. These adviser will
serve two year terms, and the
post will be rotated among the
division, Faculty adViseis for the

es, instructor in political science,
