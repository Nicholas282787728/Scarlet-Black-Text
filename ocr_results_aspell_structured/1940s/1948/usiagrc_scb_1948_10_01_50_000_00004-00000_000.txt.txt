First signs of the return of
this spirit were seen when a
large “Bert Carleton" sign ap-
peared on Barracks S-A last Mon-
day evening. This sign was fol-
lowed by a similar banner on
Dibble Hall last Wednesday night.

Because the freshmen on cam-
pus did not know and would have
no opportunity to learn any or
the cheers, Langan Hall arranged
to have a cheerleader present last
Wednesday evening to teach the
yells to all preps and others who
were interested. Dibble Hall fol
lowed suit.

Members of Langan have made
a large Grinnell emblem which
will appear at the game tonight.
All members of the ball will be
sseatted in a body, well equipped
with confetti, noise-makers and
spi t. .
