Design For Leaving

Ben Dobbs was popular witll tlle basket
ball team as well as with the student body
in general. We hate to see him go, es—
pecially sillce no one knew all the circum-
stances of his departure. Last year’s “quick
change" of coaches was almost as mysteri-
ous.

What is wrong with tile intercollegiate

athletic set-up at Grinnell‘l Why have there
been four resignations from the staff in
little more than a year? And, if there is a
legitimate reason, why hasn‘t it accom-
panied the announcements of the resigna-
tions? - _

What is wrong with the intercollegiate

Why should an out-of—town reporter ask,
“Whatta you do up there, sign a coach to
a tworyear contract with the stipulation
that he will resign at the end of the first

What is wrong with the intercollegiate
athletic set-up at Grinnell? Why is it
rapidly earning for itself the dubious dis-
tinction of a state—renowned ”graveyard

Power To The Impo’feni

With the approach of election time
Grinnell students are about to appraise
their Student Council once again. What
they see is not encouraging. The Student
Council, ostensibly the representative of
student opinion and the coordinator of
interorganizational and student-faculty re-
lations on the campus, has been progressi»
vely losing the powers specifically given it
in its constitution. (

The importance of student government
lies in its ability to reflect the wishes of
the students. Yet how effectively does
the Student Council do this? How often
do the members know ahead of time the
issues to be discussed and make an active
effort to determine the opinions of those

whom they represent?.

Since the Student Council has lost much
of its power, primarily to the C of HP and
the League Boardpperhops it should be ab-
olished and a combined League Board and C
of HP put in its place. Although this mea-
sure could conceivably make the necessary
adjustments, student opinion does not con«
Clll‘.

In the recent Student Council question—
naire the vote was 11 to one in favor of
the existance of the Student Council, al-
though less than half of the students
know about its representation, function-
ing, and duties. Actually the Student
Council is the only group actively repre-
senting both sides of the campus, as well
as the only body which advocates student
participation in its meetings. As Such, it
is bound to be more representative of stu-
dent opinion.

Rather tllan‘doing away with the Stu<
dent Council altogether, we would suggest
that a column be introduced into the S&Bi
in which someone, preferably the president
of the Student Council, could fillly discuss
the issues at hand so that representatives
and other students both could think them:
over before the weekly meetings take place.
It could also be used to explain the fate of
measures approved by the students but ve—
toed by the faculty.

To illustrate, there was a widespread ap-
proval of the plan for turning the women's
hockey field into an ice skating rink during
the winter, but how many know why it
hasn’t been done? There should be some
medium through which the Student Council
could express and defend itself.

The lack of cooperation between -the
faculty and the Student Council might be
remedied by including in 'the council a
a faculty advisor who could accurately pre-
dict facility reaction to various measures.
Such a man, for instance, might be Deanl
Strong. The lack of cooperation among rep-
resentatives might be corrected by enlarg—,
ing existing committees, creating new ones,
and giving- them all more to do. Whatever
measures are needed should be taken. 'The,
Student Council should again assume its po—l
sition as the powerful voice of the students.

lecently in these columns the idea of
ending the term bef l'e Christmas vacationi
was introduced. Wouldn’t this be a good

issue to test the real worth of the Student
Council? 11' it were found that student opin—
ion favored such a measure, how about a

drive by the Student Council for its ac-l

Dear Editor: .
Wc'rc writing this Friday night;
because we’re really interested.)
It's about your editorial this at-'

ternoon, You want to see the.
whole studcnt body work together‘
to put across “a big name dance”. 1
So do we. And, like you, we think
it can be done. .
In fact, we were working on‘
‘an idea of our own when we ran
,across yours. Over the years there
has always bccn some sort of
spring activity (aside from Spring
day) which sort of focuses the
energies of the campus just as
Homecoming does in the fall.

This spring the conference crack

Weekend somewhere around May.
15. That's enough to make the
weekend interesting, but why not
iheap a little extra effort on the
whole affair and/make it THE
jweekend of the spring? 1
' Our original plan \vent some—l
,thing like this: l
i 1, Get the whole conference in-
‘to the act by conducting a con-
itest to select a queen for ihei
:tl‘ack meet, each school submit-
lting photos of a couple of cam-
’pus'selected candidates, with abl
, rangements made for the success- 1
ful candidate to come down for}
the weekend.

2. Sponsor a. couple of campus
stunts to tie in with the long-
dormant pioneer days‘ theme —
heard-growing contests and otner
appropriate activities.

3, Cook up some sort of pug-i
eantry to work in conjunction

 

4. Top the whole thing off with;
a "name-band" dance Saturday
night in Darby.

It's a plastic idea. There’s room l
for change. Once adopted. an oil-l
campus organizations committeei
Could add or subtract. But it can
be done.

If you meant it when you said
you were looking for somebody
to take the lead. here we are. The ‘
dance-end of it can be worked out
in conjunction with Gadabauts. A,
cooperating committee wouldpliml

see everybody from :Orchesis to
the Men’s Honor G in on this one.
How about it’! .

We'd appreciate hearing thel
opinions of the rest of the stu-l
dents. Meanwhile We think we'll
go ahead. We’d like to invite the
heads of all Campus organizations,
to hold a meeting sometime dur-l
ing clic first week of the second
semester. When we have a definitcl
