Ethiopian Visitor Joins Class of ‘52 ;
Nine Day Trip Covers 9500 Miles

Food Machines
Are Novel To
“Gus” Astatke

By Alice, You as

iiachinci-y, skyscrapers, and
cthe dispensers are playing mapr
roles in tho Americanization of
Getatchew Astatke, who joined the
class of '52 last week after a nine
day trip by plane and train from
his home in Atldis Abhaha, Ethio-
pia. |

High points of the trip, madel
with four other Ethiopian students
also bound for schools in the Unit
ed states, included a three day
stop in Cairo. Eg pt, to see the
Sphinx, pyramids, and Egyptian
museum, and an overnight stay at
the Inter-national house in colum-
hia university, New York city, an-
other Ethiopian student, scheduled:
to attend Grinncll, had diftieulty
obtaining a visa, and has post
poned his trip until February.

Since his arrival in Grinnell, Mon-
day, “Gus,” so named by his
Clnrk hall friends, has been busy
chalking up “ﬁrst” experiences as
he develops llis‘aquzintance with
.Yankee culture. The most awe-lrk
spiring American gadgct to come
to his attention thus far has been
the coke machine, and he pro-
nounced his first coke “wonderful.”

In tact, he insisted on having one
for breakfast his
here.

:Olherwise. Getatchow is having
some difficulty in adjusting to
American food, which is flat com-
pared to the highly seasoned food
of his homeland. In Ethiopia, a
typkal evening meal is likely to.
ﬁollsist of “Left," a kind of bread
‘made from a native grain, “\vat,”

first morning

 

31 thick soup strongly flavored,

 

with red pepper, a fruit such as
Arabian dates, and strong coffee
or tea. He is unaccustomed to our
salads and desserts, and finds ice
titan: “too cold."

Gttatchew’s first impression of
minncll centered on the quiet and‘
act of the town.

cago confused me," he said, “There'
were so many people and houses."
He was greatly surprised at the
number of women in slacks. ”Do
they wear them all the time?” he
wanted to know. Another source
of amazement was the number of
men and women smoking. In Eth-
iopia only the Moslem men smoke.
The trip on the Rocket from
Chicago was Getatchcw's iii-st

ride on a streamlined train, and
the only sizable portion of the
9,500 mile trip which he did not

cover by air. Impressed and just‘

a little Worried by the rapid speed
the train, he asked the conduc-

acm tor at each stop if he had arrivedl

at Grinnell yet.

Elm and maple trees, squirrels
and sparrows, which are common

to our campus landscape are far
removed from the flora and fauna
of tropical Ethiopia. When invited
by Greg Newell to go liuirting tor
pheasants and rabbits, Getatcliew
said. “But I only know how to
hunt lions and tigers!"

Gl'inncll college came to Gctet

Chow’s attention through D .l
Christian A. Ruclimick, superin-
tendent of education for His ita-
jesty's government in Ethiopia.

Gctatchcw' and his four travel»
ing companions are former Stll~
dults of Haillc Selassie Fiist Sec-l
ontlcu'y school, located about 12‘
kilometers from Addis Abladba.
The school, which accomotlatcs 200
students, is ConSIdered the best ol
its kind in Ethiopia. The Bl’ltlSh:
system of advancement by examk
nation is used, and students attend
for a maxnnum ot five years. Get-
atchew attended for three ycal's‘
on a government scholar-ship. He‘
spanks some Fraiich and Italian.
as well as English and his native
Amharic.

Demanded By Students
Olivet is a small congregational-

christian College in olivet, lllchr,
with an

enrollment of approxi-l
mately 300 students and 30 fac-§
ulty members. Recently it has been'
prominent in the news because of]
a recent strike on the part of some
so students in protest to the dis—
missal of a distinguishcd facultyl
member.

 

In view oi the situation the fac—i
uity union has banded together‘
and turned in a formal protest to
ithe Board of Trustees. The union
‘argues that: 1. Academic morale
ii‘equires tenure now. “Neither stu—
ldents nor faculty can function
i properly in a turmoil of rumor and
>anxiety over who is to be fired‘
inext.“ They recommended that an
adequate tenure program be for-
malized by written contracts iii-
corporating the same now. 2. Re
store the discharged professor and
his wife to their regular status, be—
cause no reasons were given forI
their dismissal. 3. The financial?
future of the college and the pay;
of remaining members are imper-K
iled by the current turmoil, Iti

must be ended now. I
