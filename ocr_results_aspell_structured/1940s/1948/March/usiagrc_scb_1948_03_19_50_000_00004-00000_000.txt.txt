New Kil'chen Equipment»
To Be Shown Al'ﬂaenhou-se

Guess again, It’s not new
turniture for Loose pm‘lor‘nor
even bigger and better ash trays.
That Gargantuan hardware that's
been appearing- and disappearing
in the south end of the Quad log-
gia is part of a project now un-
der way to make the Quad kit»
chen one of the best equipped
and most efficient in the state.

The renovation process, begiin
last June and scheduled for coin-
pletion before the end of this
school year, includes the laying
of a new tile floor, tile walls, and
the installation or a complete new
set of custom-built, seamless,
stainless steel equipment An
openhcuse, at which all students
will be invited to tour the kit-
chen, will he held when the job
is complete

The first step was the laying‘
of the tile floor last summer, in
place of the old concrete floor.
Tile walls were put in during
Christmas vacation. Saturday,
Mar, 5, new dishwashing and:
,pantry equipment was installed.
During Spring vocation pot and
pan sinks and other pieces will
be put in, and the rcinainder,.
including an electric holdingi
counter to keep food warm untill
the moment it is served. should!
be in by June.

Easy to keep clean, stainlessi
steel is non-corrosive and highly
durable. The new equipment res;
places the wood and galvanized‘
iron pieces which have been in
the Quad kitchen since it was
built in 1915.
