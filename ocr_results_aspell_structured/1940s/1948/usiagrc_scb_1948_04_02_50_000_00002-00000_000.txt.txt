Gadaboul’s Giveaway

At housemeetings on the Monday follow-
ing spring vacation, Apr. 19, there Will be
an alerZLn'lDLlS referendum to decide wheth‘
er or not the Gadabouts club will be sub-
sidized again next year.

Recalling the mixeup on January’s bal—
lot wllen not enough time was given stu-
dents to think over the alternatives and vote
wisely, the S & B takes this opportunity to
review the situation as it stands today.

The recent increase in college costs
turned over $7.50 per student to an all—1n-
clusive social fee. of this amount, $41 goes
to each hall, $1.50 goes into n “Sinking-
fund,” and the remaining $2 can go either
to the halls, to the fund presumably to cow
er deficits, etc., to the Gadabouts clllb, or to
a combined C of HP-LB fund.

Under the Gadabouts subsidization
plan, the organization can count on a
certain revenue at the beginning of
each semester. Under the old system
it had to depend on initial sales,
plus sales at dances for the first two
months of each semester.

In this way, functions can be planned
much further in advance and all materials
can be bought wholesale at a saving of over
25%, thereby providing more money for
the functions Also, students are saved the
price of Gadabouts tickets each semester.

We realize that the plan might work a
hardship on those who rarely use the bene-
fits of Gadabouts functions. May we re-
mind them, however, that »if the subsidy is
voted down, students will still have to pay
the $150 social fee plus at least $3 per se-
mester for a Gadabouts ticket.

Under either system the Gadabouts cli-
rectors would receive the same salaries but
would be in a better position to put more
money into each social function under the
subsidation plan.

During this transitional period,
for as long a time as the social fee can
afford to contribute money to Gad-
abouts, and since all students would
have to pay the same social fee wheth-
er or not Gadabouts were subsidized,
the S & B modifies its stand and urges
adoption of the following plan:

1. Approve turning over to Gad-
abouts $2 per person from the over-sup«
ported social fee for 194849.

2. Reorganize the Gadabouts setup
so that it no longer remains a private en—_
terprise but becomes an outright organ of
the Student Council with a paid manager
in charge.

3. Greatly reduce, cut out entirely,
or spread over a group of helpers the sal—
aries of Gadabouts assistants. Why not
salaries for S & B, Cyclone, or Zephyr as,
sociate editors ”.7

4. Further coordinate the activities
of the Quad and men’s social chairmen to
include what are now Gadabouts activi-
ties, with the new social chairman in
charge of every activity.

5. If the time arrives that the so-
cial fee cannot contribute enough to sup-
port the Gadabouts functions, return to
the old system of the Gadabouts enter—
prise. _

Thus far, subsidation has worked su0<
cessfully. There is a decided saving to the
individual student (about Sits-$7 per year in
Gadabouts tickets). The new system Will
tempt more and more people to .make use
of the Grinnell social system. Finally, the
over-all social chairman will be able to pro«
vide bett ' entertainment and dances since
he and his assistants will plan every school
social event from the one desk Well in ad-

vance.

Last week, the Grinnell College Zephyr,
long a pioneer in advanced trends of publi-
cation, appeared on our campus with what is
doubtless the most far-reaching step in edi-
torial and typographical development since
the invention of movable type.

ed to be based on the assumption that a fl
leaf should have no reading matter on i
Imagine the effect, in New York publishing
circles when word gets around about the
small Mid-Western college which has pub-
lished a magazine with 16 ﬂy-Ieaves!

After initial joyous shock of the
reader upon witnessing this phenomen-
on, however, he is apt to ask himself
some questions. The S & B, with its
policy of public service through back-
grounding news, herewith clarifies the
meaning of Zephyr’s format:

The cover is, of course, intended as an
eye—catcher. Naturally then, the editors
1turned to the large cigarette companies for
pictures of all the celebrities they could as-
semble, complete with testimonials. Being
devout, the editors conceded the greatest
possible amount of space to the Easter sea-
son. Purple and gold are traditional Easter
colors. Other than that, the front cover had
no significance.

We need not here review the breathless
expectation with which Grinnell readers
leafed through the next 16 empty pages,
their relief in finding, at last, a college mag-
azine which was consistent, which made no
attempt to be humorous, and which was
designed to take up a minimum of the read—
er’s time.

Saluting Grinnell’s ilvzlnt-garde of lit-
erature in its first faltering albeit fear—
less, leap into the-unknown (to them) field

of publishing, we must, however, point anti

a few missed opportunities:

1, Wouldn’t more good have been
done by supporting closely—allied blue
ribbon candidates by coming out before
the Student Council elections?

2. With such close liaison between
them and the Cyclone, could not the
editors have arranged to pirate some
photographs“.7 These gems of Grinnell
life could have been used in an ex,
ti‘emely _humorous two-page . center
spread.

3. With such an available organ for
campus comment could the editors not
have included called some attention to
humorous lampoon of campus institu—
tions, such as the school newspaper?

‘ 4. A magazine of the Zephyr type is

frequently a good outlet for cartoon-

ists of talent. Some humorous car
toons might have been included. Care-
fully distributed, they lvould not have
destroyed the theme of the magazine.

5. A column, perhaps under the
name of “Chapel Chatter" might have
been included, containing witty com-
ment on the doings of Grinnellians.

6. Such a publication might also
contain short articles too light in tone
to be accepted in a literary magazine.
Care must be taken, however, not to
assemble a school of castvoff Tanager
writers.

These are merely some questions and sug-
gestions. Obviously, however, the editors of
Zephyr had their own reasons for doing
what they did. Far be it from the hacks
of journalism to dictate to the literati.
