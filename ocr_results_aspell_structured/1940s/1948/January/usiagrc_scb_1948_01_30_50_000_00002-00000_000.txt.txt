Unpss’reurized Copy

We wonder how many Gi'innellians have
considered just how much freedom the best
and most widely circulated campus news-
paper, your Scarlet and Black, enjoys

How many of you actually know, for
example, whether or not the Scarlet and
Black “copy” is subject, in the last analy-
sis, to an administrative thumb? How
many of you know that there are college
and university papers all over the country
which are free in no sense of the word?

If you read the newspaper accounts about
the administrative seizure of the Daily
Iowan last fall, you got an inkling of the
precarious position of some school papers,
But did you ask yourself, “Could a thing
like that happen at Grinnell?” The Daily
Iowan felt the Whip crack because of the
consequences of certain derogatory state—
ments made about the football coach in “by
lined” columns.

Perhaps the reason you, as a student
body, apparently have not thought about or
discussed freedom of the press in relation
to your college paper stems from the fact
that you have not had to think about it.
You have found in the Scarlet and Black
coverage (perhaps haphazard at times, but
nevertheless legitimate) of the major and
minor issues which concern your college life.
Administrative actions (and the reasons he
hind them) ; rulings from the offices of the
deans; Student Council proceedings, C of
HP and League Board transactions; as well
as college news in a lighter vein, have all
been published in a factual and (to the best
of our knowledge) unbiased manner.

But Scarlet and Black policy has not
been all “sweetness and light.” You have
found in editorials, in “by—lined” columns,
and even in good ol’ Doric, views reflect-
ting‘ student opinion contrary to official
opinion and action. You have found digs
at faculty and administration which have
probably given you a certain amount of
satisfaction. . .. ,. . ..

On at least one occassion this year the
Scarlet and Black printed an anti-adminie
strative action editorial which lost the Cole
lege money from a regular contributor.
Your campus “rag” could have been given
at least 20 lashes by the powers that be, but
the fact remains that it was not,

The St let and Black contiues uncen-
sored. Nc faculty member or administrative
off 'al goes over the copy with a black
pencil. After the reporters and staff mem-
bers have finished with the copy, it goes
directly to the Grinnell Heraldrltegistcr,
where, incidentally, the staff sets it in type.
Then it is locked in the page forms and run
through the presses. When it hits the cam»
pus, the weekly issue of the Scarlet and
Black is just as much “news" to President
Stevens, the faculty,~and the administration,
as it is to Joe Grinnellian.

mal for what seemed to be purely superficial
reasons, it was forced to spend an unantici»
pated $150 to disguise the gym for the out-
standing social function of the year.

As a result Gadabouts found itself with
only enough funds left to sponsor the sem--
ester formal. For the bulk of students this‘
situation has meant two consecutive week
ends without a campus social activity. Gad-
abouts managers have stated that adequate
fluids would have enabled them to provide
at least one function during this period
which would have been to the lament of the
Legion.

achieve the same results—AT A FRAGi
TION or THE cosri.

If there is going to be a feud between thel
housekeeping and .foods departments,
wouldn’t it be to greater advantage if they
would compete for the title, "we, who serve
the students best?"

Since this problem has been long enough
stagnating in the cesspool of discussion, we
would like to present two possibilities for
action by the Strident Council:

First, that the foods department be res-
pectfully requested to cooperate to the ut—
most in its authoritative control of the
dining room facilities.

Second, that students be allowed to prove
that their labor would, under adequate}
supervision, be more efficient and cheaper"
than any the housekeeping department can
furnish.- l

We feel that, by incorporating these slig—
gestions into campus procedure, not only
could existing functions be improved but,
successive open week ends could be avoided.

Orchids For A Change

The impressive, eight—encore performancei
of violist William Primrose Monday evening
was a privilege to hear. Rarely have Grin-
nell students shown any virtuoso more ap~‘
preciation. Never was an artist more cape
able and more gracious to his audience.

Primrose is not the first, but the fourth
in the current Grinnell concert series,

which has sparkled with genuine artistry 9

since the first concert in October. For this. \s .

great array of entertainment we are indebted ‘
to the Concert Series committee, whose
wise judgement and forehanded action ob,
tained for Grinnell the brilliant list of per
formers for the current season. l

With the Bel Canto trio; the soprano‘:
voice of Camilla Williams; the vivid two-2
piano work of Whittemore and Lowe; and‘
now Primrose, the committee has repeatedly
1:1th its deftness in selecting none but the
es .

From the student body as a whole and
from the S8213 in particular, a “thank you’U
to the Concert Series committee. We hope
the new five or six concert series plan willI
contiinue with an equally brilliant list in]
future seasons. '
