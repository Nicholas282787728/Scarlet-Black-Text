Ve’rerans Adminisi‘ra’rion
Announces Receni Ruling

Veterans now enrolled for study
who discontinue their training un—
der the GI bill before their period
of entitlement to training at gov-

ernment expense is used up must

obtain what the Veterans Admin-
istration calls a “supplemental
certificate of eli illty" before
they re-enter training.

If the veteran has satisfactorily
completed the previous course,
the supplemental certificate can
be issued almost immediately. If,
however, he has failed in his or—
iginal program, it is necessary
that he receive complete profes-
sional counseling before a new
certificate can be issued.

There will be no reduction in
subsistence payments for student
veterans who are out of school
during the Christrnas~New Year
holiday recess, the Veterans Ad-
ministration said.

student veterans will continue
to receive the full subsistence al—
lowance to which they are en-
titled. The time they are on holis
day vacation will be deducted
from their period of eligibility.

so announced that prima facie
