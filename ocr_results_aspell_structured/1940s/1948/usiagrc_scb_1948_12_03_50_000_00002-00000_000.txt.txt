GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
DEC. 3, 1943

It's Time To Quit Fooling

About Athletic Problems

The Grinnell athlete is a singular lperson in a singular
institution. He is first a student, and then a member of the
varsity. If his scholastic efforts fall short, his marks ren-
der ililu ineligible for intercollegiate competition. He is
given no “consideration” by the faculty for his pal pa—
tion in athletics since that would be a term of subsidization
frowned upon by this college.

The athletics in which he voluntarily participates are
deemed by this college to be character builders. Grinnell
does not proselyte expert playcls for the sake of a wine
ning team, nor does the student body, faculty, or adminis-
tration demand a winning team “or else" We are, in short,
not in that category of educational institutions which has
professionalized varsity football in the name of alumni and
public relations.

But co-adjunctive withv oluutary participation is that
indefinable “sliirit”#the unknown quantity which, when
coupled with experience, makes every man play his best
game EVERY game, makes of any contest a sight to be-
held, and makes every spectator feel the satisfaction or
pride he should take in a ,team game played as though
every man “hall his heart in it.”

That “spirit” and that pride have been lacking this
season, and we believe that the following oversights are

responsible: -

PUSHING —— When 1) e r s o n a l satisfaction and
a letter are the only rewards for the exacting grind of
athletic participation, is it not more reasonable that men
can be LED farther than they can be PUSHED? Our
boys do not get free tuition, grades, spending money, or
automobiles for playing ball—and consequently do not
play in the same frame of mind as professionals, Coach
Oakes has overlooked the fact that just a word or two
to the individual about a job well done may go a long way
toward keeping his interest at a peak and his respect for
leadership high.

INCONSIDERATIONiUHdOUthdly the coach has his
problems—for as an institution Grinnell is too small to
afford all the equipment needed. ‘The existing system
works a lot'better, however, if it is not abused. Players
who turn up late for meals night after night get cold food,
hit the books later, and miss just so much study or sleep-
ing timerand all three are hard on the player. Then loo,
the foods department undoubtedly does not appreciate the
inconvenience.

POOR PUBLIC RELATIONsiEVery student should
knowiand it is assumed that every faculty member does
know—that his actions in public while he is a part of any
group from Grinnell college, reflect upon that institution.
If, under the pressure of a long trip or a hostile crowd,

or the innumerable problems facing the coach on away
from home games, that coach sets a poor example for his
men, he can hardly reprimand them for the same depart-
ures from common sense or good taste. Talking back to
hecklers or demanding faster service in hotel dining rooms
does the college a disservice.

We feel that a pow-wow with Coach Oakes by a
group of responsible persons might help solve many of these
problems. At least, the undercurrent among students and
players could become informed opinions. The students
want to feel that the team and the coach are cooperating,
and that they are not at loggerheads with one another.

A representative group would include the League
board and the Council of House Presidents, for the stu—
dent body; members of the football team and the Honor G
society for the Varsity, and representatives of the faculty,
the alumni, and the administration, Such a group would
be able to offer every possible support to the coach, in re-
turn for the missing feeling of pride and “spirit."

We therefore suggest that President Stevens arrange
a meeting at which the above listed group could meet with
Coach Cakes and his staff to discuss the athletic situation
at Grinnell college.
