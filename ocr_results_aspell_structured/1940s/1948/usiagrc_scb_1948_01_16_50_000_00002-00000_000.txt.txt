Too Early Spring

Last night a vote of all halls and cottages
airily disposed of over $2000 in student
funds, turning the entire $2-per-student
over to Gadabouts for next semester.

Aside from the fact that the vote was
committeed, formulated, and pushed
through with what might be called one big
rush on the part of League Board, C of HP,
and Student Council, giving little or no _op-
poitunity for thorough student discusSlon,
the 88:3 is mainly sore because that rush
nipped in the bud what we thought was a
pretty nice little plan. >

The plan originally called for a united
action to bring a name band to the cam-
pus. Rising costs of entertainment have
forced our Gadabouts club into a re-
trenchment policy which brings only
hollow laughter at the mention of “name
bands".

Since the increase in social fee was _not
known at the time of the plan’s conception,
the plan was for each all-student ol'ganlza»
tion to “pitch in" whatever it was able to
finance a jointly»sponsored all-school dance
sometime in the spring.

Why the whole school? Because only tlle
whole school could withstand the cost of
bringing a reallyvtruly name band to the
campus.

That was the plan as it stood, and your
S&B was all ready to plump for it in this
very editorial. But with the quick vote
and all, well, maybe there‘s still hope.

It may not be too late even now, to per-
suade Gadabouts to put this money aside
for such a use. Disregarding the alarming
tendencies shown in administrative under-
writing of Gadabouts, which has been and
should remain, we feel, a private student
enterprise, we point out with equal terror,

"Rec" Not Wreck!

Those frustrated individuals recently
seen moping through our freezing campus
ways are merely members of an elite
group which not long ago found itself with-
out a home. They had started the annual
run indoors to see who could get established
first on the settees but had found the doors
barred. No one loved themithe rec room
was closed

No longer, however, need these nomads
wander, for the powers that be have rein-
stated ye royal nook, and once again it is
expected that the parlor set will be busy.

The rec room closing was a sordid
affair. Neither the administration nor
the students were the winners. The one
fact outstanding is that it could have
been prevented had not certain indivi-
duals who think it their mission in life
to write on washroom walls and draw
must-aches on billboard Signs desired to
add the rec room to their laurels.

The damage was extensive. Ceiling fix-
tures were torn off, chairs broken, coke
machines put out of order, bottles broken,‘
table fixtures twisted off, ,and, in general,
the place looked like a mess of rubble._ l

Let’s face it. There are rules governing
the use of the rec room. We didn’t make
them. Ill fact we think some of them are
pretty juvenile for the average college stu-
dent, But they DO exist, so wlly not ac-
cept that fact and try to live up to them.
After all, what is the percent in wrecking
the place again, only to have the room pad-
locked once more?

Let’s take it easy on Main hall‘s pride
and joy, abide by the regulations, and see
if this “experiment” can‘t become a per-
manent hideout. What better place to rec
(rec, that is) on a cold winter's eve?

Taken alone, both spirituality
and education are.weak, but “to-

So said Earl Peisner, Smith soph—
omore. in a chapel address yester-
day. .

Peisner. second student Speaker
of the year, spoke on “The Three
E: vs. Herrick”, and expressed
the hope that more students
would be in favor of Herrick than
the Three E's.

He presented the E's as a sym-

opposition to Herrick on Thurs-

today, according to Peiancr, has
swung the other way, and he
called on students to remedy it.

Peisner was assisted by Mar—

Charles McMurrey. Dibble junior.
Sara Jane Hornung, instructor ln
music, was soprano soloist.

“The current trend is toward
God," Peisner asserted, “but It
