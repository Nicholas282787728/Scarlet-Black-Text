GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Prep Cagers
Defeal‘ Coe

First Year Men
Win from Invaders
In 42 to 37 Thriller

The Grinnell freshman cagers de-
feated the Coe preps, 42 to 37,
in a fast game played on the local
floor yesterday afternoon.

First blocd in the game went
to Grinnell as Boyd Kennefick
dropped in a basket. Coe retaliat-
ed and kept ahead of the‘Fioncer
preps for the next few minutes,
only to lose the advantage at the
middle of the first period, as Car-l
Blandin and Frederick Webb led
the Grinnell rally.

Grinnell left the floor at the
half leading 24 to 13.

Coe pulled up within four points
of the Pioneers in the second half,
but the Kohawk rally fell short as
the Grinnell preps matched their
opponents bucket for bucket in
the closing minutes of the game.

Webb was high scorer in the
game, sinking tour baskets and
three free throws for a total of
ii points. Blandin was perhaps
the most outstanding man on the
floor, with DeWitt, Kennefick.
Dykstra, Laster, and Palmer show~
ing up well.

With a view of the past, present,
and future the column goes to
press this week.

First of all, our thanks to Jane
Goplemd, social chairman of w.
A. a, for the best party of the
year, the Colonial Ball. And the
credit goes to the women in the
quadrangle who showed that they

' really appreciated her efforts.
W. A. A.

At present we have the results
of the badminton and basketball
tournaments which were played
Friday, Jean Hill of Read defeat—
ed Betty Carlson, also of Read, in
two straight games to take the
badminton singles. The Elinor
Danforth»Faye Wensel combina-
tion further cinched Read's hold
on the tournament by taking
Mears' Lenore Blackwood and
Ruth Dell.

W. Al'A,
Basketball for 1940 was finished
after the Coe game when Cleve-
land defeated Mears, 3121, in a
fast garne- which starred Adele
Beyer for Cleveland and Eleanor
Osgood for Mears. Tuesday night
Halnes‘ second team defaulted to
Cleveland's second team to give
the latter cottage the champion—
ship. With a total of seventy-
five points accumulated for Cleve—
land in this tournament, the intra-
mural standings will be changed a
bit in Cleveland’s favor.
w. A. A.

Nash came back into the lineup
shortly after the second half opelh
ed, and Grinncll promptly started
a rally that threatened the K0—
hawks from then on. Coe took
time out, but the Pioneers pushed
the score up to 29-36 with eight
minutes left in the game. Both
teams played the hardest brill they
knew as the score crept up to
37742, Coe, in the last minute. The
Pioneers failed to climb fast
enough, however, and the game
ended with the Kohawks on top. ‘

Grinnell will play the Drake
Bulldogs in a non-conference game
at Crinnell, Monday night.

This is the second clash of the
season for the two teams, Drake
being the winner in the first game
by a score of 47 to 33.
