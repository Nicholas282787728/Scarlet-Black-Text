‘meelght Dixie bands,
this is well and good, for, at the

fig,” I’d like to say that I en-l

ijoy Dixie almost as much as
‘bop, and since they are two en.,

tirely different forms of jazz, I
can’t see why the partisans of
the two styles are constantly
bickering

platters of pure corn that have}
been released lately under thei
name “Dixieland.” Things like
Pee Wee Hunt’s “Tiger Rag.” Ir,
you've heard his "Twelfth Street
Rag” (and who hasn’t!) you can
imagine exactly what this one
sounds like. Not only is it trite
and corny, but it’s sped throughi
at a tempo which would leave‘
any time “tail-gate" man gasp.
