The Alumni Scarlet and Black
has a column called “25 Years
Ago at Grinnel which recalls
world shaking events that hap-
pened at Grinnell, such as this:
“Carpenters repairing Herrick
chapel found 50 pounds of honey
in a hole under an eavestrough.”

And this: ”Seventeen barrels
of paint went into redecorating
the men’s dormitories." Green?

The AS&B also says that the
Grinnell freshmen gridders this
season played two games, lost
them both, and showed promise
of making good varsity mater-
ial. Now just a minute . . .

Who says the faculty has
never lived? One member of a
university was arrested for dis-
orderly conduct when he stood
up and shouted, “Toss it this
way, Babe," during a theater
performance.
