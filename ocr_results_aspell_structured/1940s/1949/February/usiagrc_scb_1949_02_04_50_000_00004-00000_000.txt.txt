As a recent S, and B. edir
torial put it "The Grinncll
athlete is a singular person in
a singular institution. He is
first. a student and then a
member of the team. If his
scholastic efforts fall short, his
marks render him ineligible lor
intercollegiate competitio He
is given no ‘considcratinn' hy
the faculty for his participation
in athletics since that would b:
a form oi subsidization frowned
upon by this college.”

Freshmen spent parts of tour days in testing sessions during New Student Days in early iall.
Thc examinations included thc American Council or Education Psychological Examination, an
aptitude test; the General Culturc Cooperative test. an achievement test; and qualiiying cxamina.
tions irom the seven objectives oi the college. All scvon oi thc qualilying exams were given to
a selected group oi ircshmcn, with all freshmen taking at least part oi them.

Test rcsults wcrc relayed to iaculty counsellors, who met with ireshn—rcn iour timcs during
New Student Days, plan a minimum oi eight individual conicrcnccs during the remainder oi the
year. Each oi the 41 counsellors is assigned an average oi l7 freshmen and sophomores, with no
more than 10 freshmen apiece, Th: counscllor assists in registration, sees that each student meets
required ohjcctives, helps him plan ciiicicnt study habits, gives vocational guidance, discusses any
personal problems, and distributes grades, Juniors and seniors counsel with thc chairmen oi thcir

major departments.

 

Not all of the ﬁrst week was seriously academic. Students heard and sang traditional Grin-
nell songs for the ﬁrst time at the mass meeting where they were greeted by President Stevens,
Other highlights of New Student Days were a picnic with the Student Council and faculty counr
sellers, president's party in Cowles, supper in the counsellors' homes, formal dance and reception,
WAA and Honor G sponsored sports program, college church, and innumerable smokers, spreads,
and after-hours get—togethcrs.
