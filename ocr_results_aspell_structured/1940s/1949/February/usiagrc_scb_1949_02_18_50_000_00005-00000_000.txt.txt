early lead, slackeiicd their pace
and at the half led by 25.24

that our three—week layolr did
not hurt us too much," was

teams play against Carleton.

with is and 15 points, were the
main point-getters for Grinnell,

"hard to beat," in the words of
Coach Slaughter.

“They re the team 1.0 heat in
the conference meet " said the
likeable swimming coach, who
had nothing but praise for the
well balanced Carl team.

diving competition stamped him
as a much improved sophomore;
he and Noyce should be a vél~
uable combination in the fu—
ture. “Doc" Neilson, in the 200-
yard breast stroke, once again
finished strong to cop a third
against some stiff competition.

Coach Hank Browns wrestlers
whipped the Carl matmen by a
score of 22 in, with Segur Mil—
ler and. Gregg pinning their
men. Minus the services of
Paul King in the 121 lo. division,
and heavyweight Weir McQuol'd,
the Carleton men weren't at full
strength and therefore didnt
come up to expectations.
