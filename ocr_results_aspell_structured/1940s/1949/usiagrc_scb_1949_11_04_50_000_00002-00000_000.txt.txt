more—“We were humiliated
more last year; they should have

we made 30 preps shift on our
way from ARH to the Union and
all took it in a good spirit.”

Nancy Wolfe, Read senior,
League Board president—“The
preps knocked themselves out
dressing up. They were fairly
good about showing up for black
list duties and the overall co-
operation was good. The League
Board feels that it’s better to
have shorter prepping instead of
dragging it out.”

tageJPrepping was well-
planned. There was enoungh to
keep up the interest. but not
too much to tire everybody out.
