Barb Juel, Miss Iowa of 1949, I ,

/

Recalls Atlantic City Experienée

By Joan Wohl
“When i found out it wasn’t
all bathing suit, I was very hap-
py.”

With a reminiscent sigh of re-
lief, Barbara Juel, Miss iowa of
1949, recalled her early reinc—
tance at the thought of enters
ing a contest for the title, Miss
Council Bluffs. Although “a lit
tle leery," Barb was persuaded
by the Chamber of Commerce,
her family and friends to get in-
to the competition.

0n the basis of talent, persons
ality. poise in an evening gown
and appearance in a bathing
suit, Barb won the contest in
late July which automatically
made her eligible for the Miss
Iowa competition With her
fame, of course, came hours of
posing for photographers.

“I made sure there was as lit»

tie leg art as possible," she res
marked with a tinge of satisfac—
tion in her voice.

Though she could tell Council
Bluffs photographers that she’d
rather pose in an evening gown
than a bathing suit, her authori—
ty was practically nil after she

 

won the Miss iowa title in mid»
August. For when she got to At»
iantic City, N. J., site of the Miss
America contest, Barb was told
pretty much what she could and
could not do.

“We couldn't talk to any men
while we were there,” she ran
called. The explanation was the
fear of officials that reporters
might start scandal stories about
some of the contestants. For that
reason Barb and her mother
stayed at one hotel while the
male members of ”her own cher—
ing section" had to stay else—
where.

While she was Atlantic
City, all expenses paid, she
sometimes spent two or three
hours at a time posing under
strong lights. When she wasn’t
busy with photographers, Barb
was practicing in the coliseum
which seats 50,000 people. A
crowd of 40,000 turned out to
watch the finals after three even—
ings of preliminary judging.

Although she didn't win the
Miss America title, barb, a Loose
hall junior, sums up the whole
affair as being “a very nice ex-
perience."
