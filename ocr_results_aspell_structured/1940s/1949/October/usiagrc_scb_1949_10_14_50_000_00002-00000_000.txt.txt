Dear Editor:

May I take this opportunity
to report to the student body
the results of the campaign to
solicit contributions for setting
up the Michael O‘Leaxy Trust
Fund which took place on the
Campus during the final month
of last semester.

The not total amounted to
$60050 which has been deposited
at the Grinncll State Bank in
the form of Government Bonds
which will mature in twelve
years at a value of $900.00. This
initial sum was indeed most
gratifying to the members of
the Committee, and on their be-
half, I should like to’ extend a
heartfelt vote of thanks,

As was pointed out during the
campaign , any subsequent con»
tributions will come from the
members of Cowlcs Hall, but
the generosity of all the students
on campus for this initial drive
should certainly prove and ads
ded incentive and inspiration for

Cowles Hall to keep this worthy,I

cause alive.
May I thank in particular the

C. of H. P., Langan Hall, Raw-
son Hall. and Gates Hall for
their group contributions, in ad-
dition to the 742 Grinnell stus
dents who responded so onthusi»
astically.

Respectfully yours,
