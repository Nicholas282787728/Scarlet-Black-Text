A weekly newslmvcr puh hell ouch rue
buy of the college ym by the Gmmcll

Comes the end of January, and like all tllc rest of the
beavering~ students drooping in their library chairs, we cast
a glazed eye back over the events and texts of tile late sc-i
mester,
> Everyone breaks resolutions and makes roundups dur»
ing this frosty time, so here goes ye olde editorial board,
from the community chest to drinking fountains, from
athletics to politics, HOPING that a few stray thoughtsl'
have somehow penetrated the less obtuse campus minds
during;r the past three months.

During the presidential election period, first of all, We
attempted to stir up political interest in voters and lion--
voters, notwithstanding our friend Carl Friedricli’s c'om-
ment that it is not the duty, but only the right, of the
citizen to mark his ballot.

In addition to our non-partisan position on the neces-‘
sity for politics, we have taken a decided stand on the corn
sorship of teachers in American schools and colleges, on
the National ban, and on the reactionary... (per usual)
American Legion recommendations pertaining to the school
system. In the words of the mountaineer, we‘re “agin”
thought control from whatever source.

Getting down to Gl'innell specifics, u'e complimented
this year’s crop of freshmen on their spirit, rapped north
campus residents on the knuckles for frequent bad man-
ners, frowned on sandbags and blood, made a recommenda-
tion (long since discarded) that the senior class donate a
decent drinking fountain to ARH, and smiled as Read and
Haines took a healthy pull on the peace pipe.

Dining room c ticism started out soothing with com—
pliments on everything but breakfast, and rose to a high
tideN’l/ith tripe and hell Nellie! The issue is still in doubt.

In the Olympian realm of athletics it was this column
that recommended that the wheels on ‘campus and certain
members of the athletic department should ,get together in
democratic conference and iron out their difficulties.

As Washington's birthday rolls around, dependably
once a year, so does safety week, the community chest drive,
and tuberculosis and infantile paralysis funds, which re»
ceived and will continue to receive the perennial plug from!
this column. In addition, we threw roses to a newer com-l
munity project, George Mart’s venture into the financial—l
1y risky area of foreign films.

We promise to try again next semester to jar studentsl
from the general lethargy known as “The Grinnell Look,”
compounded chiefly of prolonged classroom maps, Doric
fixation, the big wheel complex, non-fraternalization out-
side of cliques, and non-interest in anything not contained
within the few acres known as The Campus.

We end with a plea for volunteer thoughts, When you
have got a gripe, don‘t repress, but express it. Get out
your pen and drop a message in our box!

— COMMENT
Political Ban Lifted

We were very happy to read in last Saturday‘s Des
Moines Register that the political ban on campuses of state
owned institutions of higher education in Iowa had been
rescinded. Prior to that time, a rule had existed to the effect
that political candidates were forbidden from making
speeches on the campuses of Iowa's three major state own-
ed institutionsithe State University of Iowa, Iowa State
college, and Iowa State teachers college,

‘, The State Board of Education passed this resolution
after months of heated debate. The issue was aired last
spring when Henry Wallace, Progressive party preSidential
candidate, was denied permission to speak on the Iowa uni-
versity campus and was forced to address SUI students in
a city park.

Many of us followed this situation with a great deal_of
interest, For many of us here in a center of unqualified
freedom of speech, the idea of such a ban was inconceiv-
able, especially that it should be enforced in centers of
higher education.

The ban, as we see it, had all the earmarks of thought
control. Surely every thinking individual wishes to hear
every side of every question. College students‘do not (or
should not) live in isolated ivory_towers. This ruling is
certainly a step in the right direction.

Am I in favor of the prinCiple
underlying the present system of
farm support prices? N0!

[1) One pair of strong sus-
penders (urban-industrial expen-

second strong pair (Marshall Plan
expenditures) now sustain the
pants (farm income) at a realis-
tically decent level. Why invest
in a third expensive pair (sup-
port prices)?

(2) A system of compensatory
phymems and market-made prices
is the economically und political-
iy wise way to sustain farm in—
come in event that the demand
for farm products drops sharp—
ly, Washingtonvmade (support)
prices, though flexible, are based
on ancient demand and supply re-
latipnships and are not designed
to clear the market or to guide'
use of farm resources in proper,
adjustment to demand conditions.
