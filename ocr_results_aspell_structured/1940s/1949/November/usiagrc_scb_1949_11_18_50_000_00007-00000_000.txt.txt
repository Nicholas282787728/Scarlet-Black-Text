Swimming Team Begins Workout
To Face Unbeaten Beloit Jan. 14

By l>liil Bonnet.

Eagcrly eyeing the 1950 loop championship
Slaughter and his crew oi fifteen tankers, all of whom Will be out
to better last year's third place showing in the conference. Rigid
work—outs began Monday as conditioning for the team's initial con~
test against unbeaten Beloit, league champs; here on January 14.
Using this performance as a barometer, the Pioneers will be in a
favorable position to forecast its probable success or failui-eefor

the seasons future meets.

On January 18 the team jour—
neys to Monmouth, only to
llurr,)'.back on the let to sWLm
against Carleton here, the only
other school last year to finish
above the Scarlet and Black in
conference standings. Rounding
out the remainder of the eight
card schedule will be contests
against Knox, Gustavus Adele
phiis, Augustana, Cornell, and
the conference mcct at North
field.

Looking over the fifteen man
roster we find nine returning
lettermen, tour of whom will
be swimming their last year for
the Pioneers. Rating high among
the senior members of the squad
is Sid Legg, ace free styler and
the team’s lone survwor of last
year’s crack 'medley trio, the
combination that broke two
long standing pool records. In
addition to Sid there is senior
Read Nielson, the boy who
splashed his way to cop third
place in the conference breast
stroke. Also back and trying for
another big year are seniors Blll
Frank, varsity back stroker and
Charles Battles, member of last
year's fast 200 yd. relay team.

In a quick run down of the
remaining five letterinen we
find Bob zielter, Bo Risse,
Don lessen, Clark Kingery, runv
ncr up for conference diving
honors, and finally the team's
1949 high point maker, Jack Ede
grcn who took a second in the
conference 60 and a third in the
conference we, both free style
events.

In sophomore Paul Bender,
swimming coach Bob Slaughter
finds an adequate replacement
for Stan Hall, while in sopho-
more Jim Brown, runner up for
Iowa’s 1948 'all state diving
laurels, Slaughter has a more
than able replacement for grad-
uate Bob Noyce. Other sopho—
morc aspirants are Marshall
Mayfield, Ben McGuckin, Chain
les Stryker, and Eaton Adams.

God centered, intelligently
grounded prayer. Prayer is not
a mumbling of words or a

under game

repetition of phrases. Only those .

things which dcal with what
God revealed to us in Christ,
those things which are deep
within us, are prayer. lt must
always have the‘attilude, “Not
my will, Thine, be done.” '

No one can tell another how to
pray, for the only way to learn
to pray is to pray.

Church

Dr. Stevens introduced the
final lecture, giving a brief
summary of the aims of the
series.

Dr. Harkncss resumed by re.
marking on what is too often
the attitude of Americans to-
wards their church. Too often,
she said, they are filled with'
”Christian soldiers, represented
by their wives." ‘

She remarked that one of the
early words for the Christian
church was the koiiioniaea
Greek phrase for the fellowship
of Christ's followers. The five
basic aspects of Christian fellow.
ship wcre then discussed:

It is a witnessing fellowship.
The proselytising force which
has made the church spread,
around the world is found in
the desire of its members to
testify to the inmluence of God
on their lives,

lt is a creative fellowship
Though the record is not pure
on this point, a liberal, equaliz-
ing c'reativcness has always been
the basis of Christianity.

it is a resolute fellowship.
It has undergone most of the
trials of two millioniums and
come forth unscathed. Dr. Hark;
ness spokc of those who even
today dare and sacrifice for the
church.

It is a world—embracing fcla
lowsllip. For example, as soon
as Nazidom surrendered, pack.
ages of food were bcing sent'to
Christian Germans. 3

it is a reconciling fellowshi .1
lt guides us to peace through
a faith that it is attainable on.
ly through the rcconcilmg of
tltc various conflicts of the
world.

in concluding the last lecture,
Dr. Harkness discussed the role
of young people in the church.‘
Many, she said feel it to be
sick. and care not. What all
youth should do is to enter the
church, and assume its burden
of carrying it forth in the Chris
tlun tradition.
