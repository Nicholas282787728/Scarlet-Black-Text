Mirrors!

Smile, and Let’s Face It!

By John Durham

The time has come. girls. for a searching of souls.
The time has come for a long, long look into that full-length

mirror But let me finish.

Last week the SSH! ran a story concerning coed dislikes about

college men.

To balance things, and make everyone happy, we

have conducted our own poll thisweek, to discover what it is
that Grinnell men dislike about Grinnell women. sit down, girls,

and brace yourselves.

First and foremost, the boys
think you’re sloppy. They think
your hair is unkempt and your
clothes the gee-Ironlyrgot-up-
five.minutes—beforeeclass lo o k .
They don't like blue jeans, ba-
bushkas, or poor color schemes.

You are, in the opinion of
Grinnell men, poor conversa-
tionalists. You either talk
too little, or too much, about
the wrong things—old boy
friends, for example.

The boys also say you’re un.
sophisticated, that you look at
life through the eyes of a high
school freshman with his first
drink safely inside him. You’re
too unconcerned about the mon-
ey of the man you’re out with,
and far too concerned about
parting with a goodnight kiss,
You are, that is, unrealistic.

And that's not all. Here are a
few more complaints we gar-
nered from the North campus:
Knitting in classes, or anywhere
else; too heavy makeup, clum-
sily applied; an eagerness to go
steady: artificiality; gumechew-

ling; the checking system where

by men are compared among
various girls who’ve dated them.

But brace up, girls. The end
has not come. Two of the
gentlemen interviewed had no
complaints whatsoever. And
those who did complain, you
may rest assured, will con—
tinue to beat paths to the
doors on South campus.
