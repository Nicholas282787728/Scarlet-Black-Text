SPORTS SIDELIGHTS

With the football and volleyball
championships safely in the poses-
sion of Smith and Rawson, the mad
scramble for the McMurray trophy
gets under way again Monday
night with the opening of the in-
tramural basketball season. A
repetition of last year's dawnrto»
the-wire struggle between Smith
and Rawson seems inevitable, but
keep your eye on Langan and
Clark who have been impressive
in their practice sessions.

Congratulations and best wishes
to swimming coach Bob Slaught-
tcr, who not only was married ovcl‘i
the Christmas holidays. but also
walked oft with a quick $75 as
a result of the Rose Bowl doings

Incidentally, the tank squad has a
