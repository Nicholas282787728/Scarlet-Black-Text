Dorm Softbali Championship Seen As Toss- Up

Dibble. Langan,
Rawson. Gales
Lead Field

By Chan Pi’lls.

This year’s intramural soft-
ball championship promises to
be one of the most hotly coll-

tested battles ill the whole
intramural setup, with seven

teams absolutely sure that they'll
win.

More unbiased opinion narrows
the race down to four halls, Dibr
ble, Langan, Rawson, or Gates;
but Clark is given a good out-
side chance, with the Town men
and Smith as dark horses. In
short, it's anybody’s race.

Pitching powers, often vital,
finds the Town iiien, Langon, and
Dibble somewhat stronger than
the rest. Ray Mathews is good
though he tends to he erratic,
while Kaufmann and Haminan for
Langan and Dibble are conﬁde
ered steadier.

Hammer, pitching ror Rawsoii,
while not too strong. is well
supported by both the infield and
the outfield,

Gates has been using several
pitchers, though Ralph Hart has
been seeing most Service. inciden-
tally, he is probably the best bit-
ter in the league, batting, at last
reports, something like .2371,

Behind the bat, all teams have
good men, with Dean DeWitt one
of last year's outstanding batters,
and Ted Heller, also a promising
hitter, perhaps the two most out-
standing. other catchers include
Gonias and Nelson, splitting the
work for the Dibble ten; Mitchell
for Clark; Fetig for Smith; and
Hippie and Mann for Town and
iLangan.

As for hitters, you take your
pick.

Ralph Hart heads the list, but
Jacquis in Rawson, or McCartney
in Clark, just to mention two,

will propalily give him stiff com-
petition for first place.

Dibble, considered fairly strong
all around, boasts Hamann, De
Witt, Gopleiud and Knowlton.

Besides Hart, Gates has Gonias
and Woodward, with Bob Eaton
a comer. For Laiigaii. Mann and
Roblson were the standouts in
Monday's game. so fai Clark has
found no other outstanding hitter
of McCartney's caliber, although
Walt Bums may develop into one.

Records show Krause and Fiye
to be the best hitters for Smith
and the Town men, but are un-
reliable with so few games play
ed, Many are watching the per
formance of Bob Barrett for
Smith, while the Town men are
expecting several, among them
Kotila. Vanstriim, and Krouse. to
come through.
