American Students Tour Europe
To Learn It’s Politics, Culture

By Alice Lueb

Ovei five thousand American
5,1(lents went abroad this suin—
These weie not the usual
2,111 of tourists, but, for the
r, ost part, serious minded people,
terested in learning something
about the culture and politics of
re countries they Visited. More
portant, these visitors realized
1 at they were representing the
’oung people of the United
< ates, and managed to squelch
he of the false impressions

i/ m Europeans have of us.
One' group of students. under
Beinocratic ,Actinn spent the
s iimer in Britain, attempting
to learn Something about the
L hor government. Most of the
ople expected us to be ex-
1 elnely unsympathetic 1o Britain
1: general. and to the Labor
ﬂirty in particular. When they
mind that we were not all
1'3althy capitalists, thcy labeled
L's "Woolly American liberals."

An open letter to our rcndcrs;
The Scarlet & Black. in the
last few issues of last season,
ycd host to a pair of stal-
v. rt gents who engaged in an
epistolary debate concerning,
iunong other things. certain 357
prets of student government,
"o‘llegg rules and regulations, and
personalities. Their lively ex-
rnangev was fought on several
levels or intellectual activity;
such familiar implements as sar
we, sarcasm, and quotes from
Plato were sharpened to fine
points and thrust where they
would. do most god.
It would not be entirely wrong
it. say that this series of letters
ved absolui‘ 1y nothing» But
vhc definitely indicated that
‘11 were elements of distant
on the Campus willing and
idedly able to air their Corn-
ints in the most effective way
ossible, i .thiough the medium

n to anyone who cared to
r d.

We freely admit that our mo~

 

tires for printing the Jelinek-

The question of the almighty
dollar was always prominent.
Several of us were asked if we
had any, and there were many
requests on the part of the Bl‘ll'
1511 to see these wondrous slips
of paper.

The British were amazed to
discover that not every home in
the U. S containd an automatic
toaster, a dishwasher, and all
the other gadgets Hollywood de-
picts.

0n the other hand, we were
surprised that the British people
are not starving, and that in
spite of the reports on this side
at the Atlantic, the people are
in excellent health, du, in part
at least. to the National Health
Service,

We found some resentment
towards Hollywood in Europe. It
was rather difficult there to
find a motion picture produced
in Europe.

Geselschap debate were not al»
together of the highest sort.
Frankly we thought zhc whole
thing was entertaining as all
get out, and printed it as a con
unuancc of a heartfelt belief of
ours that entertainment must be
one of the important fuctions of
the college newspaper. We like
to be amused. We like to be en-
lightened. thn we are amused
and enlightened at the same
time we consider ourselves sing-
ularly fortunate.

We once again. therefore,
cordially invite your participa—
tion in your Scnrlci .11 Black,
whencvcryou feel the urge to
contribute something of general
interest to your fellow students,
Naturally we retain the right to
doc1de what shall be published
according to our moral and
mechanical standards but all let-
ters from our readers will. rd
ceive our sincere appraisal and
thanks, Trusting that we will all
share in a great Grinnell year,
we remain your obedient serv—
