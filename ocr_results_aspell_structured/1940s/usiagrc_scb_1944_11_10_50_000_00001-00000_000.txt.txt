For Nurses and
F

Tile 1944 epidemic of his
fantile paralysis has officially
become the second worst in
the recorded history of the
disease in the United States,
it was announced today by
Basil O’Connor, president of
The National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis.

At the same time, Mr. O’Cone
nor stressed the need for more
skilled polio fighters, especially
physical therapists, and urged
that men and women 'who have
the proper qualifications make ap-
plications for scholarships offered
by the National Foundation and
its chapters.

In the first 41 weeks of 1944,
or up until October 14, there were
16,133 case of poliomyelitis, ac-
cording to the latest report from
the U, S. Public Health Service.
This is 353 cases more than were
reported in the country for 1931,
which previously luid been the
second worst year for the disease.
The all-time record was in 1913
when there were 27,621 cases.

Technicians Needed

"Although the National Foun.
dation and its chapters have
trained many physical therapists
in the modern principles of treats
ing infantile paralysis, many
more technicians are still needed
for this present fight,” said Mr.

Shows Need
Thera pis’rs

O’Connor. The greatest handi
cap in rendering effective aid in
any epidemic of infantile paralyr
sis has been the lack of physical
therapists. The National Foune
dation for Infantile Paralysis
through its scholarships in doe
credited schools of physical the-
rapy has been and still is seek~
ing to enlarge this first line of
defense.

"Thcse scholarships sponsored
by the National Foundation are
available to graduate nurses,
graduates in physical education
or those with a minimum of two
years undergraduate college work
with science courses. Such ape
plications may be made through
the National Foundation or to
The American Physiotherapy ass
sociation. 1700 Broadway, New
York 19, N. Y.

“The field of physical medicine
is expanding rapidly and this is
an opportunity for men and mm
en to enter an interesting, luc-
rative profession with a chance
of performing a humane service,”

Angna En‘l'ers

ium Monday evening at 8:00,
Angna Enters, dancer, mime,
and actress, will bring a new
type of entertainment to the
campus, described by the

“unique and enchanting.”

It is cightccn years since Miss
Enters made her debut at Green-
wich village Thcatrc, New York,

London, Since then she has re»
turned season atter season to
ever larger audiences. Miss Ens
ters has created 175 or more com-
positions, the largest rcpetoire in
the field of the dance. Her art
is distinctly original and she
uses the dance not only to por-
tray the grace of movement, but
also the more subtle emotions of
tragedy, comedy. and satire. She
is an artist of many parts. She
designs her own costumes, com—

‘poses the music for a number of

her sketches, and is the author
of a best seller “First Person
Plural” and a four act play,
”Love Possessed Juana," just
published.

tivities, Miss Enters has made a

genheim Fellowships that en.
