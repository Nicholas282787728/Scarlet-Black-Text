Kokoschka Exhibi’r
Depicl's Changes
In Artist's 5+er

Delayed by misrouting, the Ko-
koschka exhibit was put on dis»
play yesterday in Main hall labs
by. The paintings are the work
of Alistriansbol'n Oskai‘ Koko~
schka, who has long been recog
nized as one of the most out-
standing members ot that group
of German 'expressionists which
arose just prior to World war
I.

During his early "Viennese Per-
,iod" were painted several works
classified by some as being
among the greatest paintings of
the twentieth century. His work
was characterized at this time
by a, predominantly graphic quash
ity and sparsiig of color.

.After the war Kokoschka be-
came a professor at the Academy
of Dresden. Between 1919 and
'1924 his style changed radically
He dissolved all outlines with an
almost total disregard of design.
Pictures of this period are ex-
plosions of color.

After 1924 the wild colors‘ of
the.“Dresden Period” were inte-
grated without losing any of
their former brillianey, and a
number of lanscapes won many
critics to Kokoschka,

Kokoschka lived in exile in
London during the war, having
antagonized the Nazis by his
defenselof Jewish artists. His
work was branded “degenerate"
and removed from all German coi-

lectlons.

Miss Senska took her training
before coming to Gi-inneil.

In 1942, she enlisted at Mills
cdgeviilc, Ga., where she spent a
-year in administrative work at
a Navy storekeeper’s school,
From there, she was transferred
to Noi-thhampton, Mass. to teach
ships, ordnance and aircraft. ”It

and a text.

Miss Seiiska was last stationed
in Sim Francisco, where she was
attached to the impressively titicd.
Office of Director of the Eastern
Pacific Division of the Bureau of
Yards and Docks, which handles
supplies for the Sea Bees. “The
Marines have always had ii re-
putation as being the first ones
to land, you know," she said, “but
now the Sea Bees are building tlie'
runways for the Marines to land
oil," '

Permanent careers in the armed‘
services offer just as much to
women as to men, in her opinion.
“However, there is not a great
deal of chance for initiative. Most
of the devices are standardized
There are opportunities for wo-
men artists in model and map
making, drawing. animation, andl
photography."

Estimaies Given
For New Homes .

The veterans- housing commit-
tee has obtained estimates from a
local business man who states
that he could construct low cast‘
homes at the rate of one a week.
it was announced today by Jack
Mankoy, chairman. While thae
would not he luxurious, they would v,
serve in a utility capacity. l

They would be constructed,
wherever feasible, of semi~per-
manent, non»pricrx‘ity materials.
The plan stipulates that the
college furnish the property, antll
that adequate arrangements be
made to finance the units. The
committee has not as yet dis-
eussed the plan with administrarl
tioi-i otficials.

heating of these units, and the
question of adequate furnishings.
However, if these new homes were
placed in the near vicinity of
present college buildings, the
problem of plumbing and heating
could be met. “Although stocks
of furnishings in most business
houses are depleted, the question
of time and not taste should be
considered," Mankey concluded.
