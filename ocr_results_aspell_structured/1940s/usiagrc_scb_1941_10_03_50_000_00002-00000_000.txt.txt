0 Out For Bulldog Blood---

We march against Drake tonight! To a real
Grinnellian there’s no thrill comparable to
the one stirred by those words, no emo-
tion as strong. And the excitement that
accompanies the opening kick-off will run
higher tonight, because for the first time
in recent years there‘s ,victory in the offing
four Pioneers are out for blood. And it’s
said that Bulldog blood tastes the sweet—
est.

. You know, we as students have a lot to
live up to. On one hand we have a fighting,
scrapping team. On the other, a rabid group
of businessmen going all out for victory,
backing the boys with everything they’ve
got through their Quarterbacks Clubl But
if we want a victory over Drake, we’ve
got to pull even more than that Tonight
we’ve got to yell louder and longer and
more often than ever before. United like
that behind a good team, we should win

And if we shouldn’t? Then we’ll have to
try that much harder the next time. The
team won’t quitithe Quarterbacks will re»

double their efforts, And “we the students”
will be right up in front, fighting with that
Grinnell spir ’ that transcends victory or
defeat. So it’s on to Drake~zmd on Pio-
neers!

0 Taxes and Sex—Appeal.
Is the government sabotaging Sex appeal?

The recent ban on silk imports, a move
which definitely deglamorized ”leg art,”
and the new tax bill, levying an additional
10 per cent on so-cdlled feminine luxuries,
sounds to us like a fifth column move to—
ward demoralizing the country.

Briefly, the new bill provides, in part,
for the added 10 per cent tax on all cosme-
tics, furs, perfumes, and jewelry. Spol ing-
goods, electrical appliances, automobiles,
and other items will also be affected by
the tax, but to the average woman, the‘
increase in cosmetic prices will be the
hardest blow,

Although not regarded by the govern-
ment as necessities, lipstick, rouge, and
powder have g own to be more than lux—
nries to Ame ican women. Lipstick espe
cially belongs in the same class as food,
clothing and shelter,

We will elaborate The boys in the camps
must be kept contented and happy Behind
them must be a contented, happy civilian
population Over half of the civilian
population are women. How can women be
happy if their lips are mauve and their
noses shiney?

In passing the bill did congress take into
consideration that most cosmetic houses
make enormous profits on the articles they
sell‘.7 In nail polish alone, the profit is over
500 per cent on each bottle of polish. Al~
though profits on all goods have been cul-
tailed, how far has the 500 per cent been
curtailed? We don’t know, but we wonder,

Congress is made up for the most part
of men, and men are naive where the
machinery behind feminine beauty is con
cerned It would take a Gallup poll to con-
vince them that cosmetics are beyond the
stage of luxuries, that they are really
necessities.

Upon this fact, we base our contention
that the cosmetic tax is unfa And we be
lieve that our lipsticks, along with bomb-
sites are important to national defense.

 

PORT
HAVINGS

— By Bronk Kuhl —

THE DRAKE GAME: Never in our five years (no cracks please)
that we have watched football at Grinnell, have we seen such pep,
spirit, enthusiasm, and general optimistic feeling for a Drake game
”Even with the Des Moines Sunday Register board of experts
against the Pioneers, the optimistic feeling still persists.
sional bookies are not giving Drake the usual five to seven touch-
downs, and it is wise they don’t. else they be caught napping.
