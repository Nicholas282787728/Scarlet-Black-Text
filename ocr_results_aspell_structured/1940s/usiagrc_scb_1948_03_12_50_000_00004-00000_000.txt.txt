ruling held. The bill amends the
Servicemen’s ReadjuSmenL act
and the Vocational Rehabilitation
act for the disabled,

The new payments will be at
the monthly rate of $75 for a
veteran without dependents, $105
for a veteran with one depen-
dent, and $120 for a veteran With
more than one dependent.

The higher rates are applicable
on and
after Thursday, .April 1. However,
since subsistence allowance checks
are not due until the end of
the month in which the veteran
is in training, most of the eli-
gible veteran-students will re~
1ceive their first checks at the
higher rates on or shortly after
Saturday, May 1.

Eligible veterans now in school,
iwho are entitled to $75 or $105
under the new rates, will not
have to apply for the increased
allowances. Existing applications
Will supply all the information
needed to pay the new benefits,
. Veteran trainees entitled to
15120 because they have more
than one dependent will be re—
quired to submit information
about their additional dependents
before payments at the new rate
can be made.

dren, photostats or certified copies
of their birth certificates will be
necessary. In the case of depen-
dent parents, evidence of actual
dependency must be submitted.
