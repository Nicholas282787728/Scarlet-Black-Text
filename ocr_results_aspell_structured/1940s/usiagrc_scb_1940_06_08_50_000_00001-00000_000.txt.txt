Most employers indicated a
preference for college trained men
over high school, business school
or trade school graduates. They
emphasized, however, that college
trained men should be equipped
with some practical experience
before graduation.

.Among the faults that business
men found with college graduates
were that they were somewhat
overconfident, that they expect
the world to give them a job he-

GRlNNELL

cause they are graduates, and

that they err in thinking that a
diploma may be an excuse for an
.untidy appearance, careless work
and a lack of desire to learn the
fundamentals of business, the sur-
vey revealed.

Mere book ability, factual
knowledge, numerous degrees and
studiousness were deemed rela-
tively unimportant unless accom-
panied by other desirable quali—
ties, the survey stated.

‘You Can’t Take It With You’ Tops
Student Government for Confusion

Snakes alive and a black cat:
More than that, a mother who
writes plays because a typewriter
was delivered to her house by
mistake! This, in short, is the es-
sence of the commencement play,
“You Can’t Take it With You."

.A grandfather who one day
decided “to loaf and invite his
ease" sets the pace for the
screwy Sycamore family. His
daughter, Penelope, paints pic-
tures of the iceman in a Roman
toga, and writes plays the rest of
the time. The black cat serves
as a paperweight for her manu-
scripts while grandfather's snakes
are kept in a glass container in
the dining room.

One Semi-Sane element is found

in the family. Alice, the working
daughter, has trials and tribula~
tions galore trying to keep the
millionaires son from seeing her
family at its worst, This is diffi»
cult, considering the fact that her
father's fireworks blow up at the
wrong time, and the negro, Don-
ald, comes in the living room
after the skull candy dish.

Along with Kolenkhov, the
Russian, yelling "1t steenksl",
Ed, the husband of Essie, a
dancer, further confuses the Syc-
amore family rat-race by balanu
ing his time between the xylo-
phone, the printing press and the
piano.

Maybe it’s confusing,
fun:

but it’s
