be either graduate school, or a
fling at business after his June
degree.

Next Year‘s prospects.

Despite the 1055 of these four
players, hopes for next year are
not too dismal. Coach Ben Doug-l
las, who leaves for Colorado coll
lege April 1, claimed that Grin-l
2211’: new coach will inherit a
squad of players ‘who have one
hustle necessary to win a ma-
jority of their games, Coach
Douglas said. “Prospects are}
good for next winter, but even
brighter two years hence."
