ng Preps .

To Begin Hell Week Tasks

In case any of you alumni anti
upperclass students are wondering
why the freshmen women are so
unusually gay this homecoming
week end, I point out that the
week end means more to them than
just struggling With homecoming
decorations and greeting old
friends Hoiiiccoming is significant‘
for freshmen women because it
marks the week end before the
«week of woc._(ic, Hell Week),

Hell Week Will begin on Tues-
day, Oct 27, with each prep sport-
ing seven pigtails,,all tied With
ditferent colors of ribbon or socks.
No make-up can be worn, and
(fellows take note), all skirts
must be worn above the knees.

Any stray outsider who might
pass by the bookstore on Wednes~
day Will probably question the
sanity of Grinnell students. Each
prep, upon entering the bookstore
steps, must sing to herself the
chorus of “Here Come the Plon-
cers," and must continue singing
until she leaves the bookstore
steps. Prep caps must be worn
down over the foreheads. touching
the eyebrows, and galoshes or
boots must be worn. All preps
must smile widely all day, except
when a building is entered,

Preps Will also have a chance to
play “air raid" on Wednesday. This
entails carrying a paper bag large
enough to go over the head and
small enough to he folded into a
notebook. When any upperclass
women shouts “Air raid,” you
must stand at attention With the
paper bag completely over your
face and head, and cannot move
until the “all clear" signal is given.
This may be done near the main
portion. of the class buildings only
between the changing of classes:
and at anytime on the rest of the
campus. "Air raid" is a favorite
game here at Grinnell, as any
sophomore will tell you.

On Wednesday night preps must
Mush their hair, a duty that won't
take long since the “hair-putting-
up” procedure that usually follows
a shampoo won't be allowed. Preps
ivill be glad to hear that they don’t‘
have to wear their prep caps on‘

Thursday, although another hat is I

required in its place. Heels and
dark anklets will complete the cos-
tume, along With eye shadow and
mascara, the only make-up allow-
ed.

on Friday, the last day of Hell
Week, preps must wear their hair
' at least 20 pin curls, topped off
.iy a hairnet and earrings. They
must wear tennis shoes and hose
rolled halfway up the legs, and at
least two of the followin . triples,
polka dots, or plaids,

At Friday night dinner. preps
must come dressed in Halloween
costumes and masks, prepared to
give a minute skit or song andl
dance if called upon.

(secretary to the president). It
is not possrblc to oprn the cliapr.

A chain of Jobs, one dependent
upon the next, has dt-layetl plan
for M. Marcel Dupi the the
tinguishod organist of st. Sulplct
church in Falls, in prosenting LllL

on concert tour through tlis coun-
,try.

, Dr, Archibald T Davisoii, profs
icssor in the music dwision of
,Harunrd university, also had to
change his plans for making the
Gates lectures a part of chapel
dedication services. Backdrops for
his lectures on “The Place of Muse
ic in VVol‘shlp” will probably be
‘Darby gym and ARH auditorium.

Delay resulting from unfinish-
ed plastering has bottle-necked
,the organ installation procedure,
Painters can't begin until the
plaster is dry, and then electrical
fixtures must he lnstalled.‘1n ad-
‘dition, the installation crew for
the organ left Oct. 9 because
there was nothing to do until
other work was caught up. Heat
Wlll be needed in the chapel diic
ito the effect of temperature oiil
pitch during the ttuiiiig.

IL is hoped that by January
4118 chapel Will be completely flnr
ished including light fixture ,
woodwork, and permanent pew
suiting.
