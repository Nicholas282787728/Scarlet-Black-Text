congratulate him upon the opening of his gilded

pleasure dome and/or coke bar in the Cyclone

The absence of a student Center at Crinnell
has been viewed with dismay by the returnin~
veterans who recalled with pleasure the extra-
curricular cnioyment they had found at the old
White House. One veteran, however, was not
content to moan of the good old days, Snoddy
acted, and the result is the escutcheon-decorated
concession adjacent to the student Councils
Cyclone Collar.

Grinnell now has a common meeting ground
for its men and women students. We need crowd
the downtown eateries no longer. When ping
pong balls and billiards grow boring, it is just a
step to siioddy's Snack Shack for a straight
coke or a hamburger with . , . When you finish

Le+'s Dance

Saturday night dances in/Grinnell have be-
come routine social events, rather than bright
spots on the social calendar. Instead of the still,
uninteresting functions we now have, we feel that
dances should offer an opportunity for students
to mix and display the friendly attitude which is
supposed to be traditional here at Grinnell.

We would like to see at least oneplanned
program dance, designed to deﬁnitely encourage

through years of usage as the best
way of unifying the student body.

This lack of spirit is attribut»
ed to the war, but let's be more
specific. It's due to the age dif
ferences between returning veter-
ans and new students from high
school. It’s due to the fact that
so many new students, particular-
ly men, are unfamiliar with the
traditions of the, school, and that
old students, somehow, are not
performing their usual role of
passing on “the good word.” It's
due, mainly, to an apparent lack
of realization on the part of both
students and faculty-administra-
tion that things are not as they
should be.

What can be done? First or
all, we’ve got to become aware
that a uninterested and disillus-
ioned student body eventually b
comes an uninterested and dis
iusioned alumni. No college can
survive for long without interest
and*support from outside, and
active colleges are one of the
things the world needs today more
than ever before.

Then, we can do things which}
will promote the unity we need,
We need a student center. The
opening of the Cyclone Cellar is!
a good step, but the college has
long needed a permanent, central-
ly located student union. If i
