European Aid
Lecl'ure Topic

iOI Dr. Harl

Inlers Billions Spent
Will Save U. S. Lives

“We in the United States still
think we can live without Europe.
We are sending help to ourselves
when we send help to Europe, The
western world does not end here,
it reaches -to the iron curtain.”
This statement was made by Dr.
Henry Hart, visiting lecturer, at
convocation in Darby gym. Dr.
Hart spoke to the students on his
impression of post-war Europe and
the conditions he found there.

Although the Europeans are
faced with a scarcity of food,
black markets, and unstableigov—
ernments, they are not giving up,
said Dr. Hart. “We in the United
States are forgetting what happen-
ed. We are forgetting what happen-
ed once can happen again.

It is much better, he said, to
spend billions of dollars now. than
to sacrifice the lives of millions
of our men in the future. Western
Europe and the United States are
one now, more than ever before.
and without each other neither
can survive.

Discussing propaganda in the
Italian election at the Tuesday
meeting of the beginning journal-
ism class, Dr. Hart cited the
extremely widespread “battle of
the posters" as the chief propa—
ganda factor.

“There was not a single wall’in
Italy that was not made hideous
by posters," he said. The Com-
munist party and the various enti-
Communist parties plastered post-
ers one over another, "I counted
as many as forty superimposed
one on another."

The posters, at first ineffective
because they were printed in very
small type, became more pictorial
in form and vicious in sentiment
as the election neared. “The day
after the election,” Dr. Hart said,
“every man, woman. and child
was out with brooms, mops, and
water, and within twenty-four
hour-s every vestige of the war of
posters was wiped out and Italy
was clean again!”

h sub] ct ths Sunday. Mar an
Doty, Read Junior, and Alan Jones,
Dibble junior. will assist in the
services,

Dean Strong will be the speaker
in chapel Thursday in ARI-I audi-
torium at 10 a, In. His subject will
be “Cynic or Visionary?”
