A Changing Tradition - -

One of the oldest, and yet most cons
troversial traditions on the Grinnell cam—
pus, is that of prepping or “hazing" for
both the llew men and women students.
Those people who argue against it, point
out, most effectively, .that it is being ban-
ned in most universities and colleges, e‘s—
pecilly in the east. But, from point of fact,
many of these schools are dropping prep-
ping because they have failed to realize
that this particular institution, along with
many others, must change to meet the
needs of changing time.

They have retained an old prepping
program that probably began when these
schools first opened their portals to stud—
ents. Many of them have taken over their
programs from the earlier English univelu
sitics which began such a program back
as early as the fourteenth century.

The hazing program at Grinnell has
changed during the years. Every attempt

 

has been made to eliminate the unnecessary
and the outmoded in our hazing program.
A good deal of the program for both men
and women seems silly, perhaps. But, exv
periencc has shown that those foolish little
things one is compelled to do during fresh,
man days telld to create and cement t0x
gether ill the minds of the alumnae some
of the most pleasant and lasting exper-
iences of their entire college career.

It is not unusual, when a group of old
classmates meet again after being separ—
ated for a good many years, to break in
before the initial hellos are over with re-
marks tinted with a definite nostalgia for
the “good old days" when “prep-beater“
Alex Smith was on campus, or when Lucy
Jones used to tiprtoe around from door to
door trying to catch the girls smoking in
the rooms, etc.

Perhaps nothing does more to promote

-the unity of a class. Both the fellows and

the girls enter into much the same type
of program. Some of it is designed in such
a way that it will provide a definite aid
for them, socially. The rest of it often
seems to'be designed to provide some def»
inite aid for the upperclassmen, physically.

As a regular part of the Grinnell prep-
ping system, both sides of the campus make
every attempt to better their study rou»
tine, improve their manners, teach a corn
taiil amount of respect for those of more
experience, and endeavor to help them in
any way possible with their school work
and personal problems. If freshmen do not
conform to the required standards, proper
disciplinary methods are taken. Certainly
no faculty member nor student should con»
sider a program such as this to be unwise.

Despite the objections one may have to
prepping, they cannot overlook the definite
advantage to be found in a well—executed
plan for freshman discipline No better
device could be used to solidify a greater
feeling of class spirit, and through the

'class, of college spirit.

PURE BEAUTY

The prep halls certainly aren’t
letting any grass grow under ihcii
feet with the men . l . anyway,
not if Saﬂee McAicc, La Rue
Dietz, or Joy Dunn are any ex-
ample. Mind if our heads spin
a little?

And then there’s Scott Crom
giving that Umbrigllt idea. some
serious thought. Takes you back
to the old Pine Tree days. . . .

We notice Peregoy has got him-
self mixed up again in that old
triangle, point A being Jack,
with B and c nicely occupied by
Kayser and Kcltner.

‘ And while we're on geometric
figures, let's not overlook Joe
orui, the old rcctsnglss- boy.
Guess Gladys, Twylioli and Gwen
just don’t fill the bill. How about
that, B. J?

Could it he that Marcia. need
is finding competition in limb
dio “‘ehb? Hartley, what would
you say?

Say, Neil siioilum, why don’t
you givc that li'l blonde a chance?

Wc wondered if little Bill Hal-
per would ever rind anyone as
cute and tiny as Bobs . . . we're
satisfied now. We’ve put our
Stamp of approval on Irene
cicumcr.

To the Editor:

Recently the iollowiug petition
was signed by oil senior women:
“We. the women of the class of
1946, petition that. all senior womr
on be required to take only two
hours of physical training the
first semester of the scmor year,
and no physical training the sec-
ond semester. Those desiring to
have additional training may be
permitted to take such work."

Both faculty members and sen-
ioi-s agree that the colloquium
program has been more fully de—
vclopcd; there is a two-hour meet»
ing each week. A definite read

each division; independent study
is now on established fact; and
more is expected of the senior
woman as a student. Almost cv-
ei‘y student is willmg to cooperate
with this sutfened program, but
she asks that she be given the
time to carry ll. out oftentively.

Since the class of '45 is small,
almost every senior Woman has a
major campus responsibility and
many hold two important offices.
Nineteen women of this small
class are livmg in freshman lions.
Because of the increase in fresh
man enrollment, there is an added
responsibility; and it is an estab
lished fair: that even in xiii-moi
years the Job was not a smsll one.

Because of the inconvenient
times in which the desired classes
are offered, every senior woman
finds her independent study in-
terrupted by lengthened gym per»
lods. Campus responsmilities are

.“nol: limited to a schedule; prob

lems siisc constantly which must
be handled immediately, in spite
of a hockey class. Because of
the split campus, these jobs take‘
more time than formerly.

No woman leads a sedehtary
life; it is not as if she has moons
of transportation from one cam-
pus tc the other. ’she will not
degenerate physically irom lack
of exercise.

0n the majority of college
and university campuses, senior
women are not required to take
any physical educsis'ou. Why
should Grinnell be the exception?

Since there is a provision for
those who desire to take extra.
hours of physical education, eith»
er for their major or to mskc up
their requirements, this petition
gives the senior women the
sums privilege of election as is
extended for other courses.

Senior Women feel this request
is fair. It is not submitted in
an “antivadministration” spi
they only ask that they be given‘
Lime to complete their education
in the manner which is expected
of them.

McBe‘rh Organizes
Serenade Practice

In Cowles, Dibble

A topic discussed at the second
men's house meeting of the school
year was the popular song and
how it could bc used. Tentative
plans were produced for a song
group made up of men from Dib-
blc and Cowlos.

The passing of a week has ma-
Lci-islized definite plans for sere—
nadss. Starting next Monday,
McBetll will hold rehearsals. The
mcn have been placed in harmo-
ny groups of four and evening
practice will be held after quiet
hours.

A promise of more Serenades
comes with the addition of vet-
orans and freshman returning to
school. . . Approximately 65 men
will nicks up this group. This
more than doubles the size of
this year's group in comparison
to the song group of last year.

Music Workshop To Open

The music workshop will be re-

organized this year, according to
Mr. Otto Jeilnek, music depart-
ment faculty member.

A discussion and study group,
the workshop is primarily fDr\mu-
sic majors, but anyone is wel-
come. Last year the group made
a study of Beethoven’s sympho-
nies. This year they will devote
their attention to a. study of Bach.
