Face Haines ln
Tonighi's Opener

Dibble's Championship basketball
team tangles with the all-stars
Friday night at . D to bring the
intramural basketball season to a.
close. Preceding the boys game,
Haines, champion of the girls' inn
trainural league, will play a pick-
ed team from the other cottages

The all—star squad, selected by
tho intramural board, can put
two strong teams on the floor.
Forwards on the first outfit are
Owen Morgan, steady Town play-
er, and Bill McKcon, versatile
North Road ﬂash. Lee Roose, ag-
gressive North Road center, takes
over the allestars' pivot position.

Eaton. Gates’ mainstay, form the
backcourt of the all-stars. Kolp

BEATING lHE BRUSH

WITH AL FRISBIE

Thcy say it's a long road with-
out a turning, and it seems that
our scholarly Midwest conference
demagogues have finally hit the
curve in regard to the much de-
bated freshman eligi ty ruling.

We were happy to note last
week that the loop potentatcs had
at last bowed to the inevitable,
but what we fail to comprehend
is “7in this ﬂicker of enlightment
did not penetrate their dark acad-
emic chambers long before.

When men in both the Army
Air corps reserve and the E, R. 0.
received their call to arms, allow-
ing yearlings to participate in var—
sity athletics became the only
plausible thing to do. And still
we ask the question: Why
couldn’t the conference officials
see this coming?

Army, Navy, and Marine offi-
cials have stressed the importance
of intercollegiate sports for ALL
men. other conferences, much
larger than ours, took stock of
their material early in the year
and waived the traditional fresh-
man rule. Apparently our leag—
ue's athletic rulers have just be-
come aware of the factthatwaris
not the time to sit and watch the
rest of the world go by.

It is) instead, a, time for read
jllstment, and in this transition
some of our ivy covered standards
must go, hard as it may he to
drop them.

MATHEWS

”On The Corner"

This at icle docs not mean to
imply criticism against Pioneer
athletic heads. Early last fall,
Grinnell sought to insert freshmen
in varsity lineeups, but received
seven very distinct no's from the
league's other representatives.
Again in January, Grinnell (Joe,
and Monmouth asked for relaxa—
tion of the freshman rule, but
their attempt went over like a
lead balloon.

Because of lack of material,
Grinnell, Knox, and Monmouth
were forced to dishand their swim<
ming teams, Just when their mcr-
men needed the competition most.
At Grinncll, and probably at the
other schools this situation would
have been altered if first year
men could have been called upon
to fill the gaps.

Running down the scores of the

Pioneers cage season we find
that the Grinncll quintet took it
on the chin often against teams
playing under the four year plan.
We do not claim that Giinnell
would have won these contests,
but we do feel that they would
have come closer to ringing the
hell if they had been permitted
the use of preps.

Yes. the old order changeth.
And we might add that it is
about time!

War Ches’r Fund
Gels 25 Dollars
From Honor '6'

The Grinilell War chest fund was
25 dollars richer today due to the
Contribution of the men's Honor
"G" club.

George Sory, newly elected pre-
sident of the lettermen's organi- ‘
cation, stated that all proceeds‘
derived from the club‘s popcorn
concussion during the basketball
season was forwarded to the war
fluid cause. '

“The club is in the best finan-
cial shape it has enjoyed in seve<
ral years," Sory reported, and add—
ed that the organization is plan-

ning an all school party later in
the year. '
