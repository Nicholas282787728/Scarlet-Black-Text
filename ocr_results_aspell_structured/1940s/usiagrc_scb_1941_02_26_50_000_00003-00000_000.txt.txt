Simons Tells
Security Need

Three important points of collec»
tive security among the nations
of the world were emphasized by
Dr. Hans Simons in his Tuesday
lecture at Herrick chapel.

“There can not be security with-
out established order,” the Speaks
er declared," and this order can
only be brought about by a
feeling of common responsibility
and by a separate police force."

“For collective security among
the nations of the word We must
have a minimum balance uf
powers," Simons said. He added
that partial disarmaments is no
answer to this problem, that there
must be a greater disarmament
by the larger nations than by the
smaller ones.

He further advocated an eco~
nomic alliance among the nations
as the means of obtaining a
minimum balance of power.

“We can have no security if
we do not have the procedure
for peaceful change," the speaker
continued. "Since the League of
Nations has failed, by what yard-
stick can international relations
be measured7 in order to have
any agreement among nations
there must be laws in the con-
stitutions of all nations which
recognize their relationship to the
rest of the world,” Simons de-

room, and Robert H. Norton,

students, jumping in and out the
window, said “Here" in perfect
unison after each name. Herschel
M. Colbert, assistant professor of
journalism, laid plans to issue
warrants for the arrest of all
his reporting class on the grounds
that they were disturbing the
peace.

Numerous buildings were seized
by the students before eight
o’clock classes got under way.
First to fall before the rebel on-
slaught was the A, R. H. which
fell an easy prey to the invad—
crs.

Dispatch parties were sent out
to take over Goodnoiv hall and
the chemistry building, while the
main force barricaded themselves
behind a temporary fort of
chairs, piled behind .4. R. H.
doors.

Under the delusion of holding a
pep rally, thc doors of the A. R.
H. were opened at 8:15 a. m.
and some 350 students went up
stairs to the auditorium, A band,
which began with a trombone
and a drum, rapidly grew, and
by the time the mceting came
to an end, finally consisted of

Young’s speech in which he
told the student body in general
that the “Flunk” day was just
about over, and the Honor 'G‘ in
particular that he no longer wish-
ed to belong to that Drgmlzar
tion, was the most courageous
and most tactless thing this ob—
sorvel‘lhas seen in some time.

Cagcy Ben Douglas followed
up Young's speech, and the Grin»
iiell basketball coach tactfully
warned the student body that it
would be all to the good if they
returned to their classes. The
meeting soon broke up.
