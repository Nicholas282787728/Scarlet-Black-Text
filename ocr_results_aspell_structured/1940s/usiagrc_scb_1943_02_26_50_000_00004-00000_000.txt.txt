Grinnell Five Play
Drake Tuesday .
At Des Moines

Gnnnell rings down the curmin

on its 1942-13 basketball season
when they meet Coe here Satur-
day, and travel to Des Moines
Tuesday for the traditional game
with Drake university’s Bulldogs,

coe will be remembering the
43-50 pasting the Pioneers hand-
ed them on their own floor when
they take the court here in the
last home game of the Pioneer
season. Although they have only
a 3-4 average in conference com-
petition, prior to the Grinneil up-
set the Kohawk dope-bucket, the
red and gold had been undefeat-
ed in the Midwest cage scramble.

By winning Saturday night's
embrolio, the Pioneers can put
themselves in an advantagous po-
sition to cop third place in the
conference If Cornell. who has
won four and lost four, loses one
of their remaining games against
Knox and (302, Grinnell will auto-
matically take over “Show" spot.

Tuesday. Grinnell will be re-
newing a basketball rivalry with
Drake, which dates back to 1907.
The Bulldogs hold a two game
edge in the 68 game series, and
seem to hold a magic spell over
the Pioneers on their own court.
Grinnell has not bested the Des
Moines crew on their own floor
since 1936.

The Bulldogs lost some of their
bite at mid-season when Jerry
Dirksen, standout freshman cen-
ter, was lost to the wbi and
blue squad through ineligib ity.

Drake has won two and lost
six in the Missouri-Valley race,
but they held a powerful Creigh-
ton aggregation to a 49-47 win
last week, They hold a 3532
triumph over Grinneil in a game
played earlier in the year.

Coach G. Lester Duke indicated

that his probable starting line-up
for both games would find Tex
Kaufmann and Ralph Hart at
forwards, .Harry Waters at cen-
ter. and captain Edd Bowers and
Tod Kenneﬁck in the backcourt.

Joe Dykstra. reserve center,
and Kennerick will be playing
theirrldst games in a Pioneer
uniform. Both men will receive
diplomas this spring.

Will ‘Receive ‘Ody Wd’rers
Memorial Trophy Shortly

Dibble hall, 1943 intramural bas-
ketball champions, will soon dis—
play the new basketball trophy,
fashioned from a basketball own-
cd by the late Grinneli athlete,
Ody Walters. with a 22-13 vic-
tory over Smith, the champions
ended an undefeated season, earn-
ing easily the right to keep the
trophy until dethroned

The basketball of which the
trophy will be contructed, was a
gift to the athletic department
by Mrs. Walters. it will be a
permanent memorial to the first
Grinnel'l boy to die in his coun-
Lry's service in World War ll.

The starting line-up of the
championship team includes Dick
Gadient, Dick Hebson, Dick Port,
John Miller and Churck Gee.

Several postponed games re-
main to be played before the final
standings of the rest of the teams
can be determined. Clark, Town,
Rawson and North Read, however,
are all in the running for second
place. Clark split even this week,
defeating South Read and bowing
to Smith, to retain their hold on
second place so far. Clark needs
a victory over Gates to cinch
their place.

Town trounced both Smith and
North Read to finish the season

with four wins and three losses.
Rawson also racked up two vic-
tories, over Gates and South
Road, to equal Town's record,
North Read's victory over Gates
balanced a loss at the hands of
Town, leaving them with an equal
Win-loss column, and one game to
go.

Smith, South Read and Gates
occupy the lower bracket with
only one wm apiece and some
tough opponents blocking their
way out. The remaining games
are scheduled for Saturday at-
ternoon.
