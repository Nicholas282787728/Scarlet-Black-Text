A Near Miss

For a student body that two nlontlls
ago was screamillgly intent on picking an
actly the right type of student leadership,
Grinnellians appear to have been more than
a little obtuse conceming tlle affair of the
Near-misses on North Campus.

Tllis is the ideal year for lls to reaf-
firm the right (nay, the duty) of Grinnell
students to govern themselves through de-
pendable, responsible governing bodies; and
the only vay we can learn to steer our own
little ship of state is to do it! It thus would
seem that something is amiss, when a col-
lege administrative officer feels it necessary
to step in and punish an offense on which
the Council of House Presidents takes only
limited action.

In former years, administrative action
was the last recourse, and usually the final
step, used to inﬂuence student behavior . l .

. and the system worked pretty darned well.
It w rked well because the College trusted
the students, and the students had the guts
to back up the decisions of their chosen
officers.

In the problem at hand, then, which
element was lacking in its treatment? All
intentional act which disturbs the sleep of
a‘number of people is surely punishable
in some way, and one which involves lit-
tering the campus with broken glass de»
mands something more than a reprimand.

But for anyone to expect the new .0 of

in developing both

swamped agenda, to carry off treatment of
the offense in a perfect manner, is to ex-
pect too much. True, there have been other
instances of the same kind, about which
nothing was done. But they did not take
place under our present C of HP. And when
discussion of the matter between College
and C of HP officers might have resulted
in more definite action by the C_ 01 11411”,
it ‘seems strange that no such discusswn
took place.

We have then, a “double fault”fone
on the part of student officials for giVlng
the matter “easy” treatment, and one on
the part of College officials for being all
too willing to take the affair out of the
hands of the students.

' A Move Forward

Following nearly a year of uncertain,
ineffective and unsatisfactory experience
under the emasculated prepping rules
adopted last fall, Grinnell men, by a ma-

freshman and school spirit, cooperation, and
cohesion than this year’s program proved
to be.

Strict and just application of the rulesl
adopted last Monday night will be the

 

greatest factor in making the new prepping
program the success it deserves to be. This;
will be largely up to the house presidents,1
and the success of the program will go far.
in restoring to their office the prestige and
authority it carried on the campus before‘
the war. ) i,
_ A secondary result of the intensified‘
prepping should be the revitalization of a;
cherished pre—war Grinnell creed which em~'
phasized that participation in college and,
hall activities was a privilege to be earned,‘
not just a commodity to be purchased mere-
ly by paying tuition and college fees. The
existence of this belief aided immensely ill
creating both a vital and rewarding com—
munal hall life and a strong student gov»
ernnlent. Its reappearance on the campus
will again achieve the same result.
