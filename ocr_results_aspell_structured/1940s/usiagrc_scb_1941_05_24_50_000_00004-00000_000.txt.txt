Telephone Victimizes
Local Fire-Eaters

Grinnell's fire department was
victimized by a faulty telephone
connection this morning.

A telephone call sent the local
flame eater-s to 527 Spring street.
However, there was no fire at
that address, and no one living
there had even thought of turning
in a false alarm.

a hurried survey of the situa-
tion showed that a small roof
fire was running rampant at 921
Spring street. Prompt action on
the part of the anti-arson squad
brought the flames under control.
