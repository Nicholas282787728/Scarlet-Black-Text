“Probably the choir and glee cluhs may be
singled out as the tiest organized groups. or
course, their difficulties are less than those of the
lurid and orchestra, which must rely on a wide
range of instrumental skill. What is most minor-t-
nut is that each year the groups develop and en-

performed, and one cannot ask much more from
student performers."

student recitals are really the substance of
the musical year, in the opinion of the critic.
“several or the recitals really stand out as exCltr
ing perroriiiers, and it is unfortunate that more
students do not take advantage oi this opportuni-
