0 After the Election

If you feel as we do, you are thankful that
election day has come and gone. Fliendshlps,
temporarily sundered, are renewed; brood-
ing looks on students’ faces are replaced by
expressions of happiness or calm resigna-
tion; political concern is directed toward
local student government; in short, we are
once more blessed with peace and unity,
This is a healthy sign, and we eainestly
hope that it is indicative of a nation—wide
reaction. No one knows how many horse»
power of emotional energy have been ex»
pended in this election, nor how many
homes and communities were rent by politi-
cal differences We do know that this has
been the most bitterly contested election
since that between Wilson and Hughes in
1916. Because of the heat engendered by
the contest, and because of the extravagant
statements that have been made on both
sides, many fear that we have emerged
from the election a bitter and diVided people.
We sincerely hope that this is not the
case, For the gravity of our position can
be best understood when we realize that we
are the sole democratic power remaining in
the world, and that we are hemmed in on
both east and west by totalitarian powers
frankly desirous of our wealth and natural
resources. We see Italian newspapers al»
ready playing up the hope that internal
division in the United States will cripple
our national defense program, and render
impossible an intelligent, forceful foreign
policy. Japan, also will be watching the
election aftermath with keen interest And
there is no telling how many German sy'ms
pathizers in our midst will be quick to seize

There arc, however, encouraging signs in
the election campaign that show the Ame
el‘ican determination to remain internally
harmonious, Wendell Willkie displayed rare
common sense ill his refusal to make foreign
policy the major issue when he might very
materially have benefited from such action.
Specific programs to promote national unity
were prepared by both political parties well
in advance of the election, a feature which
has never accompanied any other presi-
dential election.

it is to be assumed that we, as intelli-

the wisdom of this movement for unity,

0 Thanks, Bill
it is with a sincere feeling of regret that
the Sczulet and Black is forced to accept
with this issue the resignation of William
C. Harris as editorial director of this paper.

Harris was and still is an exponent of
free speech. He had to say what he
thought, or he would not say it at all. If
what he thought did not jibe with the
thoughts of the majority, he still said that
which was on his mind, Such actions are
the i'undaiiientals of free speech and a
free press, and are the back ground of a
democracy.

The Wi'tings of Ha ‘is were not always
in step with the majorl y of the student
body, or the powers that be in the facility
or administration. And that is ‘how it
should be, for what benefit is an opinion
i it is never critical‘i7 Regardless of how
critical Har is‘ editorials may have been,
they were always thought-provoking and
would almost always bring to play the other
side of the argument

The S~arlet and Black sincerely thanks
Bill Harris for his services to this paper.

plentiful discussion should exist. Other suggcs»
Lions and. criticisms should be carefully considered,
if and when they are forthcoming.

Certain features of the proposed plan may be
worthy of a trial, especially the proposal of elect»
ing representatives from the halls instead of die
classes. Others, such as the great increase in
the number of members, may be unwise, These
ideas should he carefuiy discussed And that
discussion can not be adequately completed in
one weekend!

Hence, it is the hope of the Scarlet and much
that there will be no attempt to reach a. hurried
and high-pressure solution in this matter. Tile
Student Council is now operating under a, con»
stitution which has definite and workable provr
sions for a change. if student government. is to
retain any respect, the changes in its organiza-
tion must be made in accordance wth the pro-
vided democratic manner.

The points stressed by the
group included the nlzlnnel‘ of
representation and the number of
representatives to be chosen, the
tune of elections, and the fund
tions of the Student Council at
Criiincll college.

To the editori'

It is gratifying to see the in
creased interest taken in student
government. We wish to make
our position clear in this mat-
ter. Plans have been suggested
[or a complete revision of the
Student Council. We do not feel
that any plan that has been sub-
mitted can as yet be determined
the perfect solution; however, we
do feel that they are in the right
direction.

There will he no plan voted
upon or adopted until it has been
given due consideration by all
psi-hes concerned. There will be
open discussions of the problem
and the conclusion that is reach-
ed will he recorded and drawn
up in constitutional form, Copies
of this proposal will he placed
in the hands of every student for
consideration. After this has been
(lone, the student body will vote
on the question. If it is accepted
by the students, it will be re—
ferred to the Committee on sui-
dent Organizations for approval
and then to the faculty for ap-
proval. This is the accepted rou-
iiiic for handling such a matter.
We wish to emphasize one thin :
that this is not a matter that will
be decided overnight. It is too
important to all of us and the
effects are too farreaching.

We ask your cooperation as
intelligent men and women who

die erally concerned to seriously
consider all sides of uic question
before you arrive at any definite

conclusion, ,
—nohcrc Ci Young, President,
Student Council.
