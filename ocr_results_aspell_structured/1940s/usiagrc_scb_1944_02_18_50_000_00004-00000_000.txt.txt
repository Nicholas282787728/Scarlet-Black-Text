What started out, to be al
l'u away 101- the speedy,
poised Madole team has turn—
etl into an air-7 g'ht race for,
the (01) three places between;
Nerf, Ili'nlislli, and allele,
The situation was more com—
plicated last night when Nei'

sparked by the brightest fig.
tire on the floor, Joe l<liig,'
managed to topple the smooth
Madolc outfit by the score ofj
21-19, !

The game started out with a
rush of two point swislirs by you
and Co. A widc open style of playi
developed With the dciiil take the
hindmost. Fast break against last
break gave the score to the spccrla
ier and iii sonic measure Lo tho
luckier. At the halt the score
stood at 14-8 in favor of Nett

This ragged, all open play cacr»
ricd on into the third anrl fourth
quarters but this rimc it was Ma-’
doles team who came in for their
share of the breaks. Both do
fenscs bcgan to degenerate. Man
to man was the vogue, and de-
fenders and basket shooters were
tangled up all over the floor. in
the third quarter, Neff ivas una
able to put over a single bucket
so that the last quarter opened
with the score notted.

The defenses shifted to a tight
zone and scoring ceased. With
three minutes to go and the score
tied at 19-19, Joe King sank the
final bucket to put Neff’s outfit
on top and in a tie for first place.

in most of the winner's games,
King- has made the difference be-
tween victory and the short end
Last night King sank 12 points,
far more than any other man on
the floor and also sank the win-
ning bucket. His point total for
the season was boosted to 85 put-
ting him in fourth place among
the high scorers With beauti—
ful ball-handling and [reinendousl
speed for a man of his size, King
really put on a great show.
