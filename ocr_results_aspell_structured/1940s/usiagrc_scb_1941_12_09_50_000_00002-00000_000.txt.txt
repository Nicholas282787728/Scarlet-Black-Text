(The War And Grinneil’ --- An Editorial Survey

Editorial Note:

Had the Japanese oirpluncs looming over nonolulu been the
vnngnnrd 01 on invasion from Mars, the shock would not harm
been greater to most Aluerlcnns. Here nre n few of the basic

s problems that we believe will appear as the United stnlcs settles
down to the grim business or waging war.

0 Students and War

You andl will not really feel the impact of Japan’s attack un-
til we see our friends leaving college for camp ill the next
few weeks. The shape of things to come is brieﬂy this.

All men in school temporarily deferred to complete their
college course will probably be drafted at the end of this
semester. Arrangements are being rushed through so that
they may take their comprehensives in January and receive
their diploma.

There will doubtlessly be a number of students who will
drop out of college in order to volunteer. These will further
serve to bring the war into the laps of peaceful Grinnellians.

The war will come progressively closer and closer to you
and me. Our immediate task is to show our willingness and
ability to adapt ourselves to nevw situations as they arise.

. The Yellow Peril

With most of the West coast blacked out every night, the
war hysteria that is flaming up there bodes ill for Japanese
citizens of the United States, Already developments point
towards a clash.

Aware of the deep-seated prejudice held by white Alnerr
icons in California and anticipating trouble, the Japanese-
Alnel‘icém League of 150,000 Japs has issued a statement
condemning the “treacherous attack" of the Imperial Goveln~
ment'on the United States and pledging full support to
President Roosevelt in conducting the war.

As an answer to this praisewortlly announcement, we note
that the Silrl Francisco Citizens Defense League immediately
organized El vigilantes committee to patrol the Japanese
settlement in that city. Other like committees are certain
to arise.

We must remember to resist Nazi methods of oppression
as war feeling grows in the United States.

Beatiy Complies Bra/tee List

Seventy-three Grinnell graduates
and former students are serving
Uncle Sam in the air, on land,
and on the sea, incomplete re-
ports being compiled by shelton

0 Imperial Might

Americans are notoriously Cocky in regard to their ability
and strength. Realizing this, We believe certain facts should
he stressed.

First oi’ all, Japan has the third most powerful navy in
the world. Add to this the fanatical devotion of the Japs
to their country and the ideal of personal honor, and you
must realize that Japan is going to prove a formidable
enemy. '

Secondly, the odds are that Japan is going to have the
best of the war for the first few weeks. Thailand has
bowed before the Imperial army, giving her it vantage point

of attack on Singapore. Also, the military advantage of the
attacker cannot be discounted.

Last of all, Britain and the United States mllst necessarily
spread their power over a much larger area than the Pacific,
The Battles of England, Russia and North Africa are still
very real.

We must not make the fatal mistake of linderrratillg our
opponents In World War II
