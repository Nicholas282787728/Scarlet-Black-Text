Love-stricken oratory and a

Shakespeare's ’“Love's Labors
Lost.” Kent Andrew’s streamlin-
ed adaptation of the Shakespeare
comedy will be presented again
this evening and tomorrow at
8:30
season’s first offering of the col-

The specially built fountain and
three striking gargoyles high-

A stylized version of a scene in
an Elizabethan garden, it is done
after the manner of the garden
theater made popular by Queen
Elizabeth. Disdaining to attend
the regular theaters. Elizabeth
hired companies of actors to per—

providing high entertainment is
carried out in a panorama of
cleverly planned confusion. Rival-
ed only by “The Taming of the
Shrew" for the title of “lightest
of Shakespeares plays,” An—
drews adaptation of "Loves La»
bors Lost" owes much of its im-

imuin of lines.

Mr. Andrew: version omits
hard-to-produce pageantry and=
hunting scenes, and reduces the
long, tiresome soliloqllies cut-
ting the five act play to a single
scene about one half the running
time of the original, without loss
of impact. In so doing he and the
cast have achieved a divertise-
ment ideally suited both to the
limited facilities of ARH auditor-

minded Homecoming audiences.
With a consistently top notch
cast, “Love’s Labors Lost"
vides a pleasing evening’s enter-
tainment.

New Exam Plan
Will Discon’rinue
Three Hour Finals

Dean strong announced this
examinations will be inaugurated
next semester. The present meth-
od of a three hour final at the
semester's end will be discarded,
and. under the incoming system,
a minimum of three one hour ex-
aminations will be given during
the course of the semester.

Dean Strong emphasized the
fact that while the minimum of
three hourly examinations will be
required, instructors may give
more than that number if they
feel it ncccsary. Also stressed
was the fact that finals will not
be abolished; they will be given
the last class meeting of the
semester and will be one hour in
lcngth.

it is the belief of the faculty
that students will retain mater-
ial mncli more readily if they
have examinations approximately
equally spaced, rather than haw

‘ing one or two exams during the

course of the scmester and thcn
"boning up" for the three hour
final.

1t nuist also bc remembered

lthat when the new system goes-

into effect, studciits will find
themselves with three, possibly‘
four, final exams in one dav,
whereas in the system now ems
ploycd, finals are given according
to the number of the group, thus
giving the student an entire week

to complete his final examina-.

As is the case with most cold

dosage schedule starts with a
week’s supply of seven to be ob-
