No Naval Unit
Here Next Year

Decision Reached. ’
College Planned
On Presen’r Basis

There will be no naval train-
ing unit on Gl'innell campus
next year according to final
information received by the
college, Dr, Samuel N‘. Stev-
ens announced yesterday.

Discussions tor the establish—
lishment of such a unit had been
undertaken by college and Navy
offimals, and some tenative plan-c
considered, Stevens said, but
the petition or the Navy to in-
itiate the school in Grtnnell has
been denied by the selection come
mittec 01 the War Manpower
Commission.

The denial was based on
the fact that one Service unit
already is functioning at
Grinnell, that there are many
schools which have no such
unit, and that it is socially
preferable that service units
be divided more equally
among communities and col-

leges,
As it now appears, Stevens

said, there will be no change in
the present set-up of Grinnell for
next year

“I expect an enrollment of be-
tween 450 and 500 students, with
so to 100 men included,” the
president stated, “With that num»

‘ per, the quadrangle and perhaps

i one additional house in town can
accomodatc the entire student
body.”

No reduction in the faculty
will be necessary with an en-
rollment of 450 students, he
said. However, there is a ser-
ious threat of losing several fac-
ulty members through the draft,
and in that event, certain re-
placements will prove necessary.

No details can be given until
the draft status of professors is
clarified, he said. '

Major Moving Operation Consummated

With a major demolishing- opera-
tion being per-tormcd on one wall
or the boating plant, the former
college heating unit has been ele-
vated from a position of obscurity

to one of prominence, The boiler,
which has not been used since
1931, when the college changed
to city heat, was purchased re
cently by the Krart Cheese com-
pany to be used in their milk
drying plant in Hutchinson, Minn,
according to Mrs. Ray Ferguson,
head the housekeeping depart
ment,

After purchasing the boiler on
the spot, it was up to Kraft to
remove it from the heating plant,
and transport it to its new loca»

tion, she said, To accomplish this,
they contracted with the Pratt
Express company of Minneaoplis,
who specialize in the moving of
large machinery, and they agreed
to do the Job for $100 a day. Ten
days were required to complete
the Job, one day being consumed
in tearing tiic boilcr down, an-
other in extracting it from the
building, and the remaining spent
in collecting and loading on the
not our the remaining thirty or
iorty tons of excess equipment
connected with the boiler.

The main unit weighed Sevens
teen tons alone, so the job of
lifting it from the ground onto

the riot t. , rcquu'ed the assist-
ance oi the M, and St. L. uiccker

three hours and was accomplished
without a mishap. according to

The boiler and cess equipment

by rail to serve its new and vital
job in the war effort, since the
greater part of dried milk pros
duccd at this plant is sent to the
men overseas.

'Music For Fun' Will Be
Topic Ai Herrick Chapel

Women’s Social Budget will pre~
sent Dr. Sigmund Spaeth, the
“Tune Detective" or radio
and the screen, in one of his
unique programs at Herrick
chapel on April 12, at 7:45. His
topic is “Music For Fun.”

A Spacth performance is dif-
flcult to describe, beyond the
fact that it invariably enter—
tains, instructs and stimulates
an audience oi any type. It is
not strictly a lecture. for Dr.
Spaeth spends much of his time
at the, piano, illustrating what
he has to say and introducing
humorous parodies and vocal or
instrumental specialties as the
mood strikes him. He often
devotes part of his time to an-
swering the questions of his lis-
teners, -

The fundamentzi reason for
Dr, Spaeth's wide appeal and
consistent success probably lies
in the tact that lic has discovered
. way to approach music that
is not only intelligible but vastly
exciting even to those who are
completely ignorant of the sub-
Jecl. Trained musicians and
established music lovers are
equally -imprcssed by hearing
their own entllusizmm translated
into common sense terms,

There is no limit to the ma-

and he has proved equally ef—
