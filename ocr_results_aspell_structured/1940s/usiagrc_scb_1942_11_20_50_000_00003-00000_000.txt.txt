prison Camps.
quainted With the general Stand»
am of liiing which the German
pcoplc have in this war But
judged on thc basis of what the
ottrcials actually had to work
with, they were not so bad. In
the first 1): on camp, in south
Germany, 4,.r00 Poles and 500
Frenchmen ivcrc mtcrncd in a
barbed wire enclosure about half
a mile square. They were housed
in huge “circus-like" tents, and
were sleeping on loose straw on
the ground, with one blanket for
cover. This was the worst feature
of the camp, since i as their late
November and thc rnoistrirc coir
lecting in the tent and from the
ground caused a good deal 0[ ill-
ness, though no actual cpidemics.
German Food,

The food, on the basis’of aver-
age German diet, was not unusual.
All Germans are now familiar
with the "ﬁeld kitchen” meal, a
one-dish affair of cahhage and po-
tatocs, which is compulsory- two
days a week. The prisoners rad it
for two meals a day, every day of
the week. Breakfast was always,
as for most Germans, a slice of
coarse rye bread "about the color
of the chapel floor and just as
palatable," spread with an ersatz
marmalade of mashed turnips and
lemon peel.

Recoun’rs German Experiences

Continued from page 1;

Herman visited the p son camp
as an oiiicial inspector fol ii non-
bclhgorcnt nation before the Unit-
otl stotcs entered the war, under
the terms of the Geneva Convcir
tion articles regulating treatment
of pr oriei-s

Similar inspection w and is
carried on iii the Allied camps,
most of such work now being
done by Swiss as one of tho_few

Hill.» on Prisons Set-rot.

What conditions may be in the
eastern German camps, where
Russian troops are held, is not
known, Herman said. Russia was
the only country now involved iii
it which did not sign the Geneva
agreement, which is a reciprocal
arrangement. Russia does not al-
low inspection of her prison
camps and no communication
whatsoever is permitted with the
families or governments of pr
oncrs. Consequently, Germany is
treating Russian prisoners in a
similar fashion,

The general spirit of German
people is apathetic toward both
good news one! bad, Herman said,
They have long since reached the
saturation point as far as prop-
aganda is concerned. Physical corr-
ditions are had, hiit they have hot!
practice in progressive depriva-
iion since Hitlcr came to power,

out a good day's work on what

riot beautiful but they serve. it
will take something much more
serious than lack of whipped
cream to cause an internal decay.
Plenty- of Money.

Actually, the German workman
has more money now than he has
ever had in his life because the
possibilities for expenditure are
so limited, Consequently there has
been a tremendous increase in
patronization of conccrts, plays,
and other entertainments by (214554
es of people who never before
could afford them.

Herman estimated a per cent of
the German people were active
Nazis. But that small number,
with one of the most efficient or-
ganizations ill‘histoi'y, has cum-
plete control over the country,
There may be some dissention in
party ranks; Herman chooses
Himmler, head of the SS troops,
as the man who will sieze control
from Hitler. But any hopes for a
concerted movement of the mass
of the people against their gov-
ernment at this time, is wishful
thinking.
