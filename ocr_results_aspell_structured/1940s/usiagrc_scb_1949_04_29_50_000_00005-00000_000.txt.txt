Ramblings

By Bernie Beggan

Sitting here thinking about a subject for this week, I came
upon the idea of informing you Steadfast readers of all the gradr

uating seniors who have performed, or are in the act of doin
for the Pioneer athletic teams during the current year. Way

last fall, Keith Olson and EG
Booth were playing their last
game for the Scarlet and Black
eleven. During the basketball
campaign, concaptains George
Kessel and Verne Hull, and
Charlie McMurray saw their
final hardcourt action for our
Pioneers. The swimming team
saw backstroker Stan Hall and
diver Bob Noyce for the last
time, while manager John Shoee
maker was the only member of
the wrestling Crowd who will
he graduated in June.

The track squad, as well as I
can determine, will not be miss-
ing anyone next year, while the
tennis team will emerge next
year minus only the services of
Bernie Pedersen. Stew Rich-
mond and Bill Smith are the
two members of this year’s golf
team who will he graduated
this year.

With this quick survey in
mind, it seems, with all due
respect and admiration to the
graduating seniors, that next
year’s athletic seasons should he
one of the biggest and best in
recent Grinnell history. Let’s
hope so.

After one day of IM track,
Smith is in first place with 31
points, Dibble is second with
28, while Rawson has 21 points
for third. The remainder of the
meet was run this afternoon.

PS. Don’t forget the Brown
Derby Saturday night in the
Women’s gym.

Trackster Stephen Williams
Hitchcock saunters into the
.limolight as this week’s sports
‘ personality.
. He won numerals in football
lduring his ireshman year ati
Grinneli. but has concentrated
mainly on track and now holds
ltwo letters in that sport. Last

ence meet. he finished third in
the 100 and 220 and was a
lmember of the mile relay team
|that won the conference cham-
pionship.

Earlier in 1943, at the Drake
Relays, Steve ran on the 880
and mile relay teams that took
a pair of firsts in the Iowa col-
lege division. In the open col»
lege division. he saw service
with the Pioneer 330 relay team
‘which finished fifth in a race
won by BaldwineWallace and
Harrison Dillard,

To bring things up to date,
Steve copped a second in the
