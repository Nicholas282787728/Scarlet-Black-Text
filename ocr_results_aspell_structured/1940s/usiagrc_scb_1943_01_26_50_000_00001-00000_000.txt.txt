Women Must Stay in School
To Trainifor War Jobs--Kerr

MRS. FLOKE

CE S. KERR

P ting out three considerations governing the type 01' war
\l‘ol'k women will be asked to do as their most valuable con-

tribut.
Kerr,

Works ddm ni htol',

meeting ill Herllck chapel Monday to stay in school,

pleti a foul'ryear course if
DOSS] le, before beginning any
sort of business career.

The three facts to he considered
by women were listed by Mrs,
Kol‘l‘ as

1. The realization that any
plans now made by women lilti-
mately are subicct to decisions or
the army and navy as much as
those of men students; that there—
fore direct national service with
the WAVES, WAACS, or SPARS
has first claim on women's talents,
but that even these decisions may
be changed by subsequent govern-
ment action.

2. That war industries do not
need college women as much as
do the auxiliary services, and that
the chances for promotion in in-
dustry is slight for women. Rather,
women with college degrees may
use their training to the best ad—
vantage‘ on lnbor management
committees, and such positions are
becoming more numerous,

a. That community services
are the field in which trained wo-
men most naturally fit, including
nursing, child care, and rccieation—
al leadership, releasing women
with children for less technical
jobs.

“It is the job of college lenders
in such institutions as Crinnell to
spot people who have the requi-
sites for leadership and to direct
them for work requiring such
qualities," Mrs. Kerr said.

In conclusion, Mrs. Kerr advised
college women to approach their
part in business, and particularly
in war work, realistically. There
will be little glamour to it, she
warned, pointing out that their
real test would he the ability to
work hard and to do so consistent

HolciridgeAclvocdies 'Theory
of Abundanoe' "For Americans

Addresses January Grads
on Their Perl in Adjusting
Post War lnequaliﬁes

“You have a wonderful opportu»
nity for accomplishment if you
have what it takes!" were the clos~
mg words of Brig. Gen H. c. Hold-
ridge in his commencement ad-
dress to the January graduates
in Heriiclt chapel Sunday after-
noon.

In summarizing the problems of
the present generation, Holdridge
emphasized the fact that we must
adjust our minds to a world of
abundance. Our social life, he said.
has revolved around the theory of
starvation and our thinking lags
behind reality. This adjustment to
abundance will help solve the in~
ternational problems of living at
peace with our neighbors.

“The road ahead is dark and
gloomy, lined with pitfalls. In all
history no generation has been
forced to face the tremendous
difficulties which you and l are
to encounter;- began Holdridge.

"First of all, we are at war: We
are sure, all of us, that we will
win. Nevertheless, it is a tough
war against a tough enemy. Wc
say that we are fighting the war
"to preserve democracy " That is
true! But in winning the war we
have not necessarily preserved de-
mocracy. By winning the war we
are only removing the urgent
threats to our democratic way at
life.

"The United States is debt-rid.
den," Holdridge continued, “We

must determine how to redeem

our debts.

“What are we to do with our
returning soldiers? By the end of
the wztr our armed iorccs will con-
sist o[ ten million men. Another
five million are engaged in manur
iacturing weapons of destruction.
That means that only twenty or
thirty million people are supply-
ing themselves and the rest of the
country with all necessities. If this
small productive group is able to
accomplish this unaided, how can
we find work for the fifteen mile
lion men who will return to re-
gular jobs after the war?

“But I do not come to you as
a prophet of disaster. All of these
problems can be readily solved if
we begin now. Our world has pass-
ed from an Economy of Starvation
to an Economy of Abundance. We
have grown up with a Philosophy
of starvation. That idea must he
changed. This is a great revolti-
tionl

"If we accept the realities of
this situation. make use of this
new world of abundance, mould it
to our own purposes, we will enter
upon an era of prosperity such as
has never before been known. Thus
will he found a new way of life.”

Giving his conception of what
the world should he like after the
war, Heidi-idge said, “Democracy
is not negative but positive—not
passive but active—mot static by
dynamic. We cannot isolate our-
selves from the rest of the world,
