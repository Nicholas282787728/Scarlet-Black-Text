GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

MAY 6, 1949

 

Youth Fountain, Wha’ Happened? a

Early this week, along with the scorching sun and
warbliiig robiiis, came the long awaited moment in ARH his-
tory when a new drinking fountain was installed. It was a
brand new cooler model with convenient foot treadle—just
the thing for book laden students suffering with the heat.

Within seconds after the good mechanic departed, tool
box in hand, queues began forming in the halls and one we
witnessed stretched fifteen or twenty people The unanimous
opinion seemed to be that the new cooler was an unqualified
success

But amid the scene of unparallelled joy a dark cloud
was hovering that took shape in an ominous puddle on the
floor. Te new machine had hardly been functioning a day
before the mechanic was back, attacked with wrench and
hammer, and returned the shiney new cooler unprotesting-
ly to the basement of the heating plant. \

We understand that it will be back, that its displace-
ment is only temporary. We sincerely hope soinot only for
the relief of sorely parched throats but also for students
like one we found yesterday sobbing quietly to himself on

the stairs. ‘
It seems this luckless lad had ‘been inspired on Monday

to write a brilliant speech on the subject of the inadequacy
of the drinking fountains in ARH. Tuesday, the new
fountain was installed: speech rewritten, softer. Wednesday,
fountainidisappears. speech rewritten, hard again. Thurs—
day, heard rumor that fountain would return any day:
speech destroyed in a fit of pique!

of the dirt are leaves of a pecul-
iar plant called ”grass” which
generally begin to appear at this
season of. the year.

The lure of the soil, the urge
to try out the green thumb has
evidently taken hold of the
single men living in government
housing unit number 3, and feel—
ing over the agricultural enter-
prise is evidently running high
as can be readily seen above.

Le’ri'ers to The
Editor

Dear Editor:

I was pleased, surprised, and
dismayed to see in last week’s
S & B an answer from the now
not-so-mysterious Al Geselschap
concerning his letter (signed
“Vitchitivitch,” 5 do B, April 22)
and my remarks concerning that
letter in last Week’s issue. The
mixed reactions were caused by
the following: I

As concerns my Characte ' '
“Vitchitivitch” as a

producing crank with a misplac»
ed sense of humor . . .," etc. A1
Says, “We’re partially in agree-
ment" i . which statement pleas-
ed me much. However he goes
on to say that he is afraid that
I will never see it. I see it, but
I’m having trouble believing it!
Second reaction, that of sur—
prise, was brought about by the
statement he made to the effect
that I claimed the League Board
members were experts at spying.
At this point I can only sug»
gest that Al run, not walk, to
the nearest English prof for a
reading comprehension test.
That part of his letter which
caused me dismay lwas a neat
little sentence which ran as fol-
lows: “As far as underage drink-
ing goes, the state has lawsi
let it enforce them." ‘To this une

ashamed denial of a social con-
science I reply with a quotation
from Plato: “Worthy of honor is
he who does no injustice, and of
more than twofold honor, if he
not only does no injustice him-
self, but hinders others from do-
ing any; the first may count as:
one man, the second is worth]
many men, because he informs
the rulers of the injustice of
others.”—The Laws V7730.
Several more items in Al’sl
letter caught my interest. For,
instance he asks, "Since drinking
has taken a more or less perm—
anent hold on our society, would_

 

it be too heretical to suggest
learning right?" From umpty-
ninc thousand trustees, alumni,
and “friends” of the college
comes a resounding reply: YES!
And these people cannot be ig-
mored when it comes to determ-
ining college policies

There is another thing which
I hesitate to mention. since the
S 8: B is a family publication;
but, Without going into detail—
which any sociologist, psycholo-
gist (or veteran) can supply—I
wish to remind Al that there is
a special difference between
