0 Food For Thought.

As cold Weather approaches and we take to
overshoes and energizing foodstuffs we can-
not help wondering with what feeling of
trepidation Europe faces this winter Cer~
tainly the French, Czechs, and Poles can
only be pessimistic.

By Studying the comparatively bounteous
menu of the Germans, it isn’t hard to
imagine the hunger that will prevail in the
invaded and conquered countries.

The American correspondent, William L.
Shirer, reports that German ration cards
entitle the German to very little. He finds
no fruit, coffee, tea, or chocolate at all.
Meat is restricted to a Single pound per

fashions . $5,,

I HELLO AGAIN. AFTER SEEING THE PROSPEROUS, WELL
dressed alumni last weekend, our ego as far as our clothes are con—
cerned is probably slightly deflated. But don’t worry, from all ap-

pearances you people aren't doing badly.

please have some one awaken you berore you dress for your early morn-

week. Butter comes in weekly quarter pound
allotments, and sugar is rationed in half
pound amounts. Each person gets one egg
per week. The German must satisfy him-
self with bread, cabbage, and potatoes.

This rationing is the malximum. Hitler
takes no responsibility in feeding conquered
nations. The best that French, Czechs, and
Poles can expect is a slnall Share of that
bread, cabbage and potatoes,

While in this train of thought we could
look at Grinnell and its food situation for
the winter. Perhaps there will be some
dissatisfaction on the part of students.
Satisfied or dissatisfied as we may be, it is
doubtful if we would exchange our menu
for Europe’s bread, cabbage, and potatoes.

0 The Goat.

Few facts have been forthcoming on the
progress of American industry in the Battle
of Production. Those that have been
brought to light recently have been dis-
couraging. As Shakespear said long ago,
something seems to be rotten in Denmar .

At first glance the nigger in the wood-
pile would seem to be beetlebrou‘ed John L.
Lewis. Aggressive and stubborn, he has
undoubtedly been responsible for some of
the lag in our production effort. We sus—
pect, however, that Mr. Lewis has plenty
of company in the woodpile.

Word brought to Grinnell recently direct
from Washington has it that many of our
patriotic “dollar-a-year" men have fallen
down on the job. Some of these rugged in-
dividualists simply have never learned the
gentle art of cooperation.

Others are too busy scooping up profit—
able contracts to bother about the welfare
of our defense program on the whole. Un-
sorupulous labor leaders are not the only
culprits.

We hold no brief for John L. Lewis. But
keeping in mind the natural bias of the
press, it appears that Mr. Lewis has been
singled out as the “goat” for our failure
in defense production.

brownishred compound —— is be-
ing further carried on by Jean
Heinsen, this year’s honor stu-
dent in chemistry.

She devotes an afternoon each
week to special research work on
the subject under Dr, Oelke’s di-
rection. Scientifically speaking,
She is working out the formula of
the compound formed when tl-

But to the unschooled observer,
her research equipment is a thing
of more wonder than even the
name of the compound.

since no rubber or cork must
touch the vapor formed during
thc experiment, Dr. Oelke has de-
viscd and has blown a maze of
glass tubing and connections es—

On a smaller scale. chemistry
students have beenvcarrying on
some research for several yours.
William Teach, '40, and Jack Hin—

Miss Shields and Teach both as-

article by Miss Shields concern-
