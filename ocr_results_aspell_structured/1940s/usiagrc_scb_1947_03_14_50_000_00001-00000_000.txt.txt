VPincus, Thompson. Rissien, Landed
In ‘Arms And Man’ Pe—rformance

By Don Tallon

It was a well pleased and still
laughing audience that left ARH
auditorium after the rollicking,
wonder-inlly exaggerated perfor—
mance of Arms and the Man on
Saturday night.

The entire cast, after ironing
out first night difficulties, turned
in a good job that made the
Shaw comedy satire on love and
warfare as warmly humorous as
possible.

Well earned top billing went to
Phyllis Pincus as a changeable
impish Raina, and to John
Thompson as the devil-may-Cnre
Chocolate Soldier, who fought
with candy and love in place of
bullets,

Ed Rissien and Mary Eliza~
beth Wilson were grand in suoe
porting roles, and gathered many

,lauglis in their hilariously execut
led portrayals at Major and Mrs.
Petkoff.

Almost too much enthusiasm
was shown by Dorset Graves in
his interpretation of the pompous
iMajal' Saranoff, finance of Raina,
and lover on the side to die ser-
vant girl, Louka, spintedly playr
ed by Betty Sparkman. Well
worth mention was the excellent
staying in character of the ser-
vant, Nicola, by Vernon Voyles.
Raoul Hurd, clad in the handsome
uniform of a Russian officer,
completed the cast of the show

The play, slow in gaining moe
montum, gathered speed in the
second act and went on from
there to a rousing finish with
many laughs and humorous situa-
tioiis to its credit,

‘Hitlel himself told me during

not think that one single

Commenting on the recent Nur»

“There were,” Sohuschnigg con-

war crimes trials might have
been conducted better. First it
was a distinct drawback that the
tribunal was composed only of
members from the victorious
countries. Some neutrals should
have been included (Switzerland
Sweden), to give the procedings
a much more stable background.
Secondly, it would have been far
better to have had the politicians

Robbins Declares

By Mary unnnell

Rofutlng the existence of an
“Anglican faith” or any other
particular denominational raith,
The Reverend Henry Robbins,
vicar of St. John‘s Episcopal
church in Shenandoah, 1a., in
speaking to students yesterday
in HelriCk chapel declared, “there
is only one faith, that which was
given by Christ 1'

Choosing “The Beliefs andPracA
tices of the Episcopal Church" as
his topic, Rev. Robbins stated
that one of the basic thoughts
of Anglicanism is that any one
church which secs itself as thc
only true church denies Christ.
There is only one significant truth
—that is, God became man.

The Bible in the Anglican
church is used for daily morning
and evening prayers as they are

 

One Faith Exists;

‘That Which Was Given by‘Christ’

outlined in the Piayer Book. For
‘each seivice there is a text from
lthe Old and New Testaments.

There is one moralelove God
and thy neighbor. Christianity is
peace in God's love—not mor—
ality. Christ brought not a molk
lality but a new life which is
heavenly not earthly love. There
is no need of morality where
there is love. A true Christian
society would not need laws
Since this society does not yet
exist we must learn which in-
fluences we must heed in our
ilives. ,

Mary McMurray, Pine Tree
iJunior, and Lawrence Silverton,
Govt. Housing freshman assisted
with the liturgy of worship. Ellen
Altenbernd, Read sophomore, was
the soloist.
