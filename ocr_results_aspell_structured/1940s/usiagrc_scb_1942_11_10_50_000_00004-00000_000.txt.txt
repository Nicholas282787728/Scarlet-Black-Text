Pioneers Plaster Ripon In Season’s Finale, 50-25

Score Four Touchdowns in Second

Quar’rer To Clinch Midwes’r Fray

Gl'innell’s Pioneers, haunted by the Specter of one point dee

feats all Season, shot a touchdown bhl

go at a bewildered

Ripon eleven here last Saturday as the liedmen bit the dust

50e25.

Minus the services of Art
Woodward, regular center,
and Captain “Curly” Bishop,
Grinnell ran and blocked with
savage viciousness to present
coach Benny Douglas his
third conference win against

two defeats,

The Pioneers opened the scoring
orgy late in the first quarter Me
ter Waters had placed the hall
on nipon's 25 with a 23 yard
punt return. Using sheer power,
Grinnell hammered the ball over,
Southworth plunging from the
two. Jaclt Bredimus kicked the
extra point to give Grinnell a 7-0
lead at the close of the first
stanza.

Although Grinnell threw the
book at the Redmen iii the second
quarter, it was Ripon which
countered first, Led by Ted
Scaussi. whose running and pass-
ing featured Ripon's attack, the
Wisconsin eleven moved down to
the Griiinell 10, where Scalissi
pitched a strike to Paul Strickler
for a touchdown. The try for
point was wide.

Grinnell had added six points
to their total a moment later.
Jack McGrane took the hick_off
on his 21 and behind beautiful
blocking ran 79 yards to a touch-
down.

The Pioneer’s devastiiig attack
again paid dividends exactly two
minutes later when a 22 yard pass
from Waters to Tod Kennefick
terminated a 65 yard sustained
drive.

Ripon matched score for score
in the second half, but could not
whittle anything from .tIie top_
heavy margin which the Scarlet
and Black had rolled up in the
first half.

The Redmen pounded to pay
dirt twice in the third quarter
and once in the fourth, and Grin—
neII did the same.

Southworth again went over to
chalk up the first of Griiinclrs
two third-quarter markers, and
a pass from Ed Nagel to Dean
Newell supplied the second.

Army Players Fail
To Click As College
Men Strike Suddenly

The touch football all-stars con-
quered the army team Friday
night 1276. Before the game was
very old Don Johnson, an allestar,
snagged a pass from Bob Crane‘
deli and raced over for a touch-
down. In the second quarter the
Candidates were able to tie it up
on a pass into the end zone from
the 20 yard line.

In the second half the offense
of both teams bogged down be-
cause of the slippery footing and
the damp ball. In the fourth quar-
tel', however, the all-stars se-
cured victory with a series of
brilliant plays. Robison hit Gee
with an accurate pass for a nice
gain. Then McKeon caught a
pass, and with the aid of a beau-
tiful block thrown on Pollard by
Ed Krause ran to the Candidates
10 yard line. Soon the airstars
had the winning score when Gee

passed to McKeon in the end
zone.

For the Candidates Eames and
Wise played rugged ball in the
line and Pollard played well in
the line, but the slippery field
made running impossible and the
army passing was rusty.
