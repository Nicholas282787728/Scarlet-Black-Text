Pianist’s Choice

Sarah Innes MacDonald, assistant
professor of piano, presented a
piano recital in Herrick chapel
Thursday evening.

A rail-sized crowd showed their
appreciation by generous applause
as Miss MacDonald played works
by Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy,
Ravel and others.

Although her interpretation of
the more modern selections was
perhaps better done, her rendition
of the sonata 0p. 81a (Bee-

vwacious moods of the piece,
