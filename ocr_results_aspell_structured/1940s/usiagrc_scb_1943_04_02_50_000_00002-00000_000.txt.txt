Keep It Alive — - -

The low, omni 'esent rumble of a rumor—ia Grinnell special
afrom administrative sanctums injects among the student
body the seed of suspicion that Spring Day will be the latest
Grinnell tradition to fall by the wayside. The cause, natu -
ally, would be the war. Everything else that provokes dis-
satisfaction is conveniently blamed upon the War. The
shoulders of Mars are broad and strong—why not heap on
a few more blames?

We understand that We are in college to study—not to
fool around with such childish pastimes as an all-school
clean-up day and recreation. That is for Sissies. In normal
years—ﬁne. But this is war, remember? REMEMBER! I
think every man in college is quite aware of the fact. A
good many of the girls too are undoubtedly waking up to the
War. Yes, I would say we do know there is a War going on.
All the more reason for the annual celebration To answer
the prime objection that we are in school to study, not to
play, We wish to call to the attention of the powers that be
that soldiers, although they are in the army, do not ﬁght
all the time, nor do they drill continuously. In fact, the
army and navy authorities even go so far as to grant soldiers
furloughs and sailors leavesﬁjust for the idiotic purpose of
giving them a break in tile routine, It is a fine psychologi—
cal aid to keeping in one’s right mind. The officers in the
armed forces also are entitled to these limited “leaves of
absence." They too like to ”get away from it all.” It can
safely be assumed from past years’ experience that faculty
members of Grinnell college have welcomed Spring Day as
much as the students.

Administrative authorities have made a recommendation
to the Student Council that Grinnellians devote a few days
to doing odd jobs around the campus during one week, There
is a labor shortage because of the war. That is understandar
ble. Why is it not possible to combine the two—furlough and
labor shortage~to the advantage of all concerned—the stu-
dents and the campus? It is our sincere hope that the Stu-
dent Council will be able to point out the “error of their
ways" to the administration and relieve brother Mars from
this last load heaped upon his shoulders.

WE WANT SPRING DAY!

Why Editors

Hebbeln Wins
Get Gray

This issue of the scarlet and Black
is to be considered purely as an
exercise in the bolstering of the
ego of Jack Hehbeln, Rawson so-
phomoro and business manager of
the paper, Catherine Funk, editor,
announced last night.

The presence or 53 per cent ad-
Vertlsing‘ is the realization of Heb-
behi's ambition to better fir-so
semester business manager Louis
Schuler's most profitable issue.

‘Not to Be

The outlook isn’t brilliant for
a Brown Derby this year;

There is one lonely SDX—the
rest are no longer here!

Present possibilities for the an-
nual Brown Derby dance, spam
sored by Sigma Delta Chi, men's
honorary jouralistl'o fraternity,
are slim, according to Alfred
Ftisbie, Town senior.

Frisbie is the only member of

the organization left on campus
since the recent call for manpow-
er. Since a sizeable committee is
necessary to choose the various
candidates for the Various “hon-
ore,” and to print the traditional
“Black and Blue," Grinnell’s only
real scandal sheet, the possibill—
ucs look very slim indeed!
