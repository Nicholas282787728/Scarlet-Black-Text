Reserve Team
Beats Preps

Passing oi Varsity
Subs Proves Fatal, As
Yearlings Stumble, l3-0

A forty—minute football game be
tween the freshmen and reserves
saw the yearlings on the short end
of a 13—0 score. The touchdowns
were scored by Dean Newell and
Don Hook, and were the result of
passes.

The first touchdown came fol-
lowing a blocked kick deep in
freshman territory. On the first
play, Tiger Hainann passed to
Newell in the end zone for the
score. His attempt for the extra
point failed. Hock took a pass
from Hamaun for the second
touchdown and Mark Alley’s
placekiek was good.

Prep fullback Phil southworth
provided the thrill of the after-
noon with an Boryard run, but
was caught from the rear by
Jack McGrane. The yearlings
twice were inside the reserves’
loryard line, but failed to push
the bell across.

Hock, McGrane, and Alley
looked best for the reserves, while
Southward, Al Nichols. and Ben
Jones sparked the freshmen.
