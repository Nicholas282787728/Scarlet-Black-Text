Foreign Students in Our Colleges
Can be Ambassadors of Good Will

The 26,000 students from othr[

er lands now studying in Amer»
ican colleges could be immensely
valuable to the United States in
future international relations,
according to Neil M. Clark, who
discusses the role of foreign stu»
dents in “Campus Ambassadors,"
in the current Saturday Evening
Post

“These students have sharp,
inquiring eyes," Mr. Clark says.
"They are
shrewdly and don’t miss much,
and they will carry word of us
back home. In a few years most
of them will be in places of
power or inﬂuence in their own
countries,"

Of the foreign students enrolle
ed in American colleges, Canada
sends about 4200; China, 3900;

Correction

Last week the son report-
ed incorrectly that veterans
would have to make applica»
tion for annual leave at this
time if they wanted the reg-
ular 15 day subsistence As
most veterans probably re—
call, last year the VA de~
cided that the leave would
be automatically given unless
a veteran speciﬁcally turned
it down. That regulation is
still in effect for college stu-
dents

looking us over,

 

lndia and Pakistan, 1500; Tur—
key and lraq, 500 eac Holland,
270; every South American
country, quite a few; Brazil,
many; Africa, Australia and
Northern European countries,
quite a large number; Afghani—
stan, nearly so, according to the
Post article. With a total enroll—
ment of about 1200 at Colorado
School of Mines this year, '70 are
from Iran, Iraq, Turkey and
Great Britain, Brazil, Norway,

Burma, Portugal, Bolivia, China
.and a dozen other countries

At the School of Mines, Mr.
Clark found the foreign students
favorable to most American
ways, They were well received,
and have joined fratcnities and
civic organizations. They like the
freedom that women and girls
enjoy here. But they have some
fault to find.

Chief among them is that
Americans don’t speak English,
according to Mr. Clark. One
Student thinks we rush too much,
and another regrets that AmeriCr
an students don’t take more time
to explore each other’s minds.
Amerlcans are too smug, we

i make a fad of college, race prej-
udice is strong, and we place
too high a value on the money
value of things—those are among
other criticisms the foreign stu-
dents make.

“It is obvious that these stu-
dents are looking at us with open
eyes, but it's pleasant to think
that many of them consider us
‘a nice kind of people,’ " Mr.
l Clark writes. “The report of the
imaiority seems likely to be fav-
orable. And it is certain that the
things they learn here and carry
home with them and put into
practice will help to create a
smoother and faster-moving
world in some of the farther and
Ihitherto slccpicr Corners."
