Grin'ilell‘s Pioneers engage

here Monday night in‘thell‘
first basketball game of the
season. The Cyclones played
their first game last Wednes-
day when they beat a strong
Simpson team 42-30. Coach
G. Lester Duke indicated last
night that he expects a
strong Iowa State team be—
cause Simpson is perennially
tough.

“However," Duke said, "I have
conﬁdence of Winning.” He plans
to substitute freely in an effort
to find the right combination un-
der fire. Grinnells attack will
feature a fast break and individ-
ual initiative.

Bowers and Kennefiok at guards,
Waters at center, and lichrouo
at forward saw action last year.
The other forward is Jim “Tex”
Kaufman, a sophomore who was
on the Oklahoma all-state team
when in high school. Grinnell’s
reserves for the most part are
inexperienced in college hall. Men
who are likely to see action are
Vanstrum and Hart at forwards,
ﬁohison and Dykstra at center,
,ciig Millikcn. sory and Chaftee
at guards.

Iowg state has a young but
talented team which includes
Ronnie Norman and the Wehde
twins, all or whom w on the
iowa all-state teams in high
school. The Cyclones will have
the advantage of already having
a. same under their belt.

Duke asked all students to en—

ium, and to sit in the east stands,
as the west side will be open prin.

‘Ody’ Walters’ Basketball
to Become College Trophy

Intramural basketball teams will
have an added incentive to win
the basketball championship this
season, in the form of a basket-
ball, formerly owned by Edward
(Ody) Walters. The basketball is
to be made into a traveling tro-
phy, as a partial commemoration
to a former Grinnell athlete, the
first alumnus of Grinnell to die
in the service of his country dur-
ing World War 11, John Trucsdsle
announced yesterday.

The ball was purchased from
the college by "Ody" after his
graduation in 1940, to be used for
recreation during his training
period in the Air Corps, Less
than a year later, an airplane

crash ended Ody’s career. The
basketball was then forwarded to
John c. Trucsdale by Ody’s wife,
Audrey Myers Walters, also a
former Grinncll student. to be
used in any way he thought best.

The intramural board conceived
the idea of preserving the ball
and giving it its present signifi—
cance. Truesdale said,

This trophy will by no means
he the only memorial to Walters.
Numerous plans are in formula-
tion for promoting memorials to
this ﬁne athlete as Well as to
other Grinnellians who are now
giving their lives to their coun-
try.

 

INTRAMURALS 1

 

The intramural volleyball season
is swinging to a close this week,
with only a few postponed games
left to play. Proving itself as
the game in which anything can
happen, the season has had its
traditional quirks with a last
place team overpowering one of
the top outfits with comparative
case each week to add to the
interest of the race. There have
been no serious casualtics to date.

Clark has cinched at least a
tie for first place with only one
loss to mar their record. Their
conqueror, Smith, has pulled out
three victories in the last three
nights and needs only its final
victory to share first place with
the East Street Sharks.

North Read—South Read

North Read showed it: superiority
over its Southern hallmates last
night in a scrappy volleyball
match, involving a lot of friendly
rivalry. Winning easily in the
first game, the prcps were push-
ed to the limit by south Reed's
prepbeaters, but ﬁnally eked out
a 16-14 victory. it was the second
Lime this year that North Read's
policy of passive resistance, or
letting the other team lose, really
worked.

For the other game scheduled,
Smith vs. Rawsan, Rawson failed
to show up with a full term and
was forced to forfeit.
Smith—Clerk

a not-quitc-clever-enough clark
team. Using their superior height
to advantage, Smith took a one
game lead and then came from
way behind in the second scrap to
win 16-14. The score of the first
game was 1643.

Clark—Dibble

Earlier in the evening, the
Clark boys walked off with the
prize performance of the year in
flooring Dibble with a 11-0 score
in the deciding game. The other
two games were closely fought,
with neither team showing defi-
nite superiority.

The Town boys, having found
themselves after it was way too
late in the season, reversed their
usual procedure and came from
behind to beat Gates in a three-
E .9 match. The scores were
5- 5, 15-5, is 3.

Tuesday nignt, Smith started
the winning streak which they
hope may carry them into a tie
for first place, by defeating South
Read 159, and 15-11.
