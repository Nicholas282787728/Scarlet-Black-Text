A Prayer---

Deal“ War Department, hou who art all
powerful over our insignl icant fates, may
victory be your reward in all thy battles
with our enemy; this we pray. On the home
front may all your servants, civil and mili—
tary, do their work with dispatch, efficiency
and quick decisions so that here and abroad
your work shall he done well; this we pray.

And, dear War Department, we pray that
you may soon make up your mind about
the reserves and give out statements to the
newspapers of this country which are clear,
honest, consistent, and meaningful, so that
we in ERG may know Whether we are to
be or not to be; and so that what you in
Washington say will or will not happen,
does indeed happen or not happen in Omaha
and Grinnell; and so that we may pursue
our studies with confidence, ardour and
poise, secure in the knowledge of when we
shall no longer study. 7

These things we pray, respectfully, with

hope in our hearts, faith in our souls, and
our fingers crossed.

Blood For Vic’ro’ry---

Have you given a pint of blood to the Red
Cross? Why not? Have you read the testi—
monies, the praise, alld the calls for blood
plasma from the fighting fronts of the
war? Doctors continuously extol] the Red
Cross plasma as the main reason wily death
from shock has been cut drastically from
the mortality rates of the last war, Grin-
nell college should requisition the Red Cross
headquarters for a mobile unit of its Blood
Donor Service to come to this campus.

To have given such a small quantity of
your blood so that it can save the life of
a fighting man is one of the most satisfy-
ing feelings a civilian can have; one of the
best means of “doing his bit" The Reader‘s
Digest for February carries a story of a
woman who was afraid to give her blood
because she was squeamish anent the re-
slllts. Everyone should read the article
Those who feel the same way she did would
lose all thoughts of themselves and gladly
give a pint of blood, Some Marine in Guad-
alcanal would appreciate it because it can
well save his life. The Red Cross is shame-
fully shy of the quota of blood. They can~
not meet the requirements of the armed
forces at the rate civilians have been con~
trihuting. It is most certainly not their
fault. The fault lies with you and you who
have not taken an hour—that’s all it
takesgevery ten weeks to help save a life
~maybe the life of someone who is doing
your work at the front.

Some Grinnell student organization could

' win coveted honor if it would sponsor the
drive to get a mobile llnit of the Red Cross
Blood Donor Service to this campus. We are
sure Grinnellians would cooperate on a scale
never before seen here. There can be no

iAmen.

Well. We Jus'l' Don't Know . . .

Measles Are Back-
Again. Definitely

Gale Asher, Hollies sophomore,
and Peggy Gardner. Clevclsnd
senior. were take to the Commu-
nity hospital this morning With
measles, Miss Florence Swan, col-
lege nurse, announced.

With the optimistic turn of
events for the 0.0.5. on the
microbe front, the renewal of
bacterial activity in the quadrarb
gle has been interrupted by some
observers as definite proof that
diseases are unpatn'otic, anyway

And then again, it may be the
privations of civilian life during
rationing which has weakened
collegiate reSlstache.

Anyway. Gale Asher, Haines
sophomore, and Peggy Grsdner,
Cleveland senior, were taken to
the Community hospital this
morning with measles, Miss Flor<
ence Swan, college nurse, an»
llounced.
