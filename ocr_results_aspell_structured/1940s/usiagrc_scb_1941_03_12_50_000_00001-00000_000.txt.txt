Litza Koppelmann Tells First Impressions of America
Seen Upon Her Arrival Following Flight From Austria

Miss Litza Koppelmann, Mears
freshman, came to America from
Vienna, Austria, in 1933, She and
her parents traveled through
Canada, and their first glimpse
of New York was the slum dis<
trict. “This." said Litza, “was a
very depressing first impression."

From New York, Lhe Koppel—
manns went to New Jersey to
take up their new residence in
Newark, N. J.

“At first we thought cities
such as Patterson, N. J, were
small,” she remarked. “Though
Patterson has a population of two
hundred thousand, two million of
Austria’s ten million population is
concentrated in Vienna."

Another of Miss chpelmann's
first impressions 01 America was
the fact that American women
were so well-dressed and wore so

much makeup. “However," she
said, "the makeup did not seem
unusual as we were used to see-
ing it in Paris.”

“We were amazed at so many
cars.” she exclaimed. “In Europe
only the wealthy people own cars,
but most of them would rather
ride in taxis.”

Miss Koppelmann prefers the
western part of our country to
the East because the people seem
to take life easier. “This is very
comforting," she admitted. How-
ever, she does not like iowa
country because the land is so
ﬂdtl

In a general comparison the
Austrian climate is not as dras-
tic as American. “There are four
distinct seasons, and the winters
are not as cold, nor the sum-
mers as hot as those in America,”

she said.

The Viennese family left Aus-
tria after that country had been
taken over by German soldiers.
When soldiers first began to
march in, one Nazi was even
heard to have said, “Austria is
not in dire need. She still has
whipped croami" The Nazis plun-
dered the bakeries. “They also
bought all the good cloth they
could find as they had been forc-
ed to use substitutes with a paper
base for so long,” stated Miss
Koppeimann.

When Litza left the country,
she said that the physiology of
Vienna had not been marred to
any great extent Some art
treasurers had been moved to
Berlin, and some books which did
not comply with Nazi ideals had
been destroyed

The six who are still in the
running are Helen Bantu,
Haines; Barbara Leger, Cleve-
land; Kent Hampton, Macy;
Kenet Pearce, Clark; Donald
Jacobs, Dibble; and Kalman
Spelletich, Langanl

Helen Banta announced this
afternoon that she was with—
drawing her nnmo from the
list of mdidates for thc posi—
ﬁlm of student Council presi-
dent, and was releasing her
supporters to vote for whom
they wished in the coming
election.

The four candidates who
had withdrawn from the
convention at press time this
afternoon are James Miles,
Clark; Carl Blandin, Smith;
Jerry Grant, Dibble; and
Harold Goplerud, Dibblel

Miles publicly withdrew from
the race Monday evening at the
Lime of the primary bahcting in

”because of the excellent job done
on the Junior From, I am with-
dramng in favor of Kenet
