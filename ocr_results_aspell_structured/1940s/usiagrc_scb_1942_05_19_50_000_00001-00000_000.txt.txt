Boys' Slale To Be On Campus
.Legion i'o Bring 650 Here June l0-I5.

The Hawkeye Boys‘ state, Spon-
sored annually by the Iowa de-
partment of the American Legion,
will bring 650 Iowa boys to the
Grinnell Campus June 10 to 15.

Arrangements for the Boys'
state were completed last Monday
afternoon when representatives of
the Boys’ State planned the final
details with Pres, Samuel N. Ste-
vens.

The boys will be housed in the
college dormitories and quad-
rangle, and will have their meals
-in the college dining rooms.

These boys, chosen from every
county in the state by Legion
posts and other fraternal organ—
izations, will be the pick of Iowa
boyhood. Fifty counselors, mostly
chosen from the ranks of Iowa
school superintendents, principals,
and athletic coaches, will also at-
tend. Torn Norris of Dubuque

will be the general director.

The Boys’ State has been oper-
ating successfully in Iowa and is
now being carried on in a total
of 25 states as an American Leg-
ion project.

Various prominent Iowans will

gress of the Boys' State, including
Governor George A, Wilson, rlim
Dalton of the F. B. 1., Dr. Smith,
an inspirational. speaker from
the National Manufacturers As-
sociation, Frank Miles, editor of
the Iowa Legionaire, who will
give an address, and other well
known men.

The time for the annual meet-
ing will be shortened two days
this year in order that the Boys’
State may be sandwiched between
the Young People‘s Conference,
and the Institute of International
Relations, both of which are al-
ready scheduled for the campus.

Fears that the Gadabouts
might be forced to cancel the

Paul Bl‘emickel‘, president of
the club.

our members will have already
gone home.”

He stated that it did not seem

a dance which would reach so
few students.

"The school has promised to
