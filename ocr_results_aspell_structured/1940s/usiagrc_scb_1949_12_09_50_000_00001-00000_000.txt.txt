WSSF Auction Nets $250 /

['As Gibson Makes Splurgel/

By Beth Budd

With old man Etienne-kidney-
Kalllsh at the stern, the WSSF
Faculty»Servlce Auction reaped
lots of laffs and a very satiss
factoiy $250 to add to the an-
nual WSSF drive. At the onset
of business affairs in auction.
eering off some twenty-seven
items, Klausner‘s hat, before be-
ing put up for rent on the auc-
tion block, was given an added
distinction by being passed to
finance Saturday's addition to
the cheerleading staff the en-
thusiastic persons of Burma
and Allen complete in the most
replete cheering outfits. Lynn
Wales was the actual attainer
of the use of the chapeau until
Tuesday night.

Gibson Obviously Capitalist

Jerry Gibson was the man of
ostentation, wealth, and cap-
italistic resources by buying not
only the highest bid item but

, also several’others. Rightfully
i prized is the extra day and one
i half of vacation without the $5
i cuts. Also Jerry availed himself
of a ride in Mrs. Hiser’s sleigh
when and if the proper amount
of snow arrives. Further, he
bought Mrs. De la Cluse's week
of French translations. This is
made even more remarkable in

that Jerry does not take any
course in French. The immed-
iately available purchase of
Jerry’s was the use of Kuntz’s
hat and,' dare one say, brief-
Case?

A total of seven faculty mem-
bers’ dinners were auctioned off
at prices scaled from $10-$17
with menu based on curry,
chicken in various forms, steaks,
and even a nameeyour-own-
proposition.

4 To Go On Wagon

After it was made clear that
the night would have to be
scheduled to avoid Conﬂict with
the coming '“blessed event,“
Pfitsch’s roomy station wagon is
to be available for one evening
to Charlie Battles and at least
three financial associates.
Read Girls to Make Like Birds

Two of the Read junior bird—
men will actually take to the
air via Doc Sam’s plane. Lee
Tolman and Beth Budd were
completely thrilled to have Dr.
Stevens stretch their fifteen
minute ride into a ﬂight to Chi-
cago for Christmas vacatio —
providing the weather is suit-
able. Now all the gals have to
do is get their bid in with ole
man weather.
