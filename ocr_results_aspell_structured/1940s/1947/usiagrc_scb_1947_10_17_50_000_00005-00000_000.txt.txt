Vikings

Clash at LaWrenc

The Grinnell college squadleft
today for Appleton, Wis, to
face Lawrence college in the third
conference fpotball game of the

season tomorrow afternoon. Law-
rence, defeated last week in a

surprise upset by Knox college,
will he kcyed up for Grim-fell.
Lawrence has a big, hard-rune
ning team this year, using a
singlewmg, Minnesota style of-
fense. The power of the team is
evident with four former all-con.

. . , i
fel'ence men ln their ranks. Grill—

nell will be at a disadvantage,
outweighed in both backfield and

line. Dakes' squad will be do-
pending on speed and power, plus
smart, headscllp ball to defeat
the Vikings.

The Pioneer’s pass de'fense is
much improved ovcr previous
weeks ,and little trouble is ex-
pected from that source. Globe
dana, star Lawrence tailback who
has been out for the last two
games, will return to the squad
to face Crinnell.

Lawrence and Cornell colleges
are the perennial champions of
the MidvWest conference, .and it
will be up to the Pioneers to hand
defeats to both, in order to stay
in the conference championship
running.

While Cornell and Lawrence,
the preseason powerhouses, don't
play each other this year, or
hell meets them on consescutil'e
Saturdays. Following the Cornell
game, Grinnell meets Coe' col-
lege at Cedar Rapids.

Against Carleton the vikings
rolled up a score of 35 to o, and
have also trounced De Pauw, 21
to 0. This game will be an im-
portant one for both teams, the

success of their season hanging
in the balance.

Scots Win, 13 To 6
As Pioneers Tire
In Fourth Quarter

A powerful Scot line paved thel

way to Monmouth college’s 1376
conference victory over the Flee
neers on Ward field Friday night,
after both teams spent three
quarters in scoreless play. EG
Booth, fullback, carried the ball
for the lone Crinnell score.

The Pioneer line, having held
its own for most of the game,
weakened in the fourth period,
and the Scots moved over it free—
ly. Monmouth's first tally came
with less than a minute gone in

the last period. After the Scots
had powered their way to the
Crinncll one-yard line, Fceley,

Monmouth fullback, blasted hisl

way to the end zone in three suc-
cessive line bucks. The pass for
extra point was not good. ‘

Grinnell scored next, after Dori
Casey. Pioneer guard, recovered
a Monmouth fumble on the Scot
16. Steinbeck then passed to
Webb on the onEvyard marker,
and Booth drove through center
for the score. Fred Webb's kick-
forepoint failed.

Late in the final period, Mon»
mouth once again set up Stallone
down drive when Saunders pass
it) Herb White was intercepted on
tile Grinnell 35. With 25 seconds
remaining in the game, the Scots
completed a pass to the Pionecr
one. Feeley scored ‘again and
nent over standing up for the
extra point.

ity stars of last year as Glenn
“Gas" Saunders, Jim Evenson,
George Potter, and EG Booth,

Thus far, Dobhs has kept all
positions wide open so that each
man can be given every oppor-
tunity to show his abilities, Hc
has worked many different com—
lhinations during practice and e
pressed pleasure at the spii
shown in preliminary workouts.
l Following the lead of football
coach "Bunny” Oakcs, Dobbs
plans to use a maximum of plays
ers in each game. “With little
lheight to spare, the squad wlll
ldepend on speed and accuracy
for wins", Dobbs added.

ned Wisconsin 43 to 7, In earlier
games Minnesota beat Washing-
ton, Michigan swamped Stanford
and Northwestern spanked

outclassed Iowa 22 to 7. The de-
cision rests with the Rose Bowl

game.

It looks as though the intra-
mural set-up is going to be
plagued again this year by in-
efficient otficiatlng. On the very
first play of the new season Raul/e
son was obliged to register'a
protest in their game with Dib-
ble. Yesterday both games endcd
in disputes. Poor officiating is
the bane of all intramural pres
grams, We rcalize it’s a tough
job with no glory but let’s try to
improve intramural officiating
and strengthen our elaborate in»
tramural schedule.

To date, according to this 0017
umn, George Potter has un-
doubtedly been the outstanding
player in the intramural football
league. He has either made or
participated in everyone of his
team's scores, and his passing
and running are constant threats.
As a unit, Clark's line has been,
nothing short of terrific.
