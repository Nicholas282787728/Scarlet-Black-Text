Spring Fever

4 The Scarlet and Black takes this op»
portunity to join with last night’s snow
storm in officially welcoming Spring to the
Grinnell campus. According to the calendar,
it is now open season for blanket parties,
sun deck sessions, and daily rounds at the
golf course. Happy Spring Fever to all of
you!

The Bizzy Signal

On March 13th a Meals freshman coni-
pleted a phone call to a Dibble senior,
breaking her date for the Christmas (lance.
She kept herself alive by nibbling the cloth
tom the telephone cord and drinking battery
juice. A party was held in Mears that night
to celebrate her triumph. Unfortunately,
the Dibble senior had become an alcoholic
while Waiting for the pllolie call, and was
in no condition to accept or reject her alibi.
Where should we place the blame? Was she
at fault for overestimating the college
switchboard? Was he at fault for under
estimating the (staying) power of a Grill-
nell woman? We feel that the girls at
switch should shoulder full responsibility
.for this terrible catastrophe.

The S. & Bl, oiie finger on the public
pulse, has been aware for some time of the
growing resentment among the student
body. Hammond supporters in the recent
election voiced loud protests when the prac-
tice of saying “College Central, Vote for
Douma" became known. Grinnell's constitu-
tion calls for a non-political switchboard.

Another interesting situation is that
of being connected with another outgoing
call on the same line, with its needless con-

who called her just before we did. Ignorance
is bliss, except during a test. If you can’t
tell us what Baumann plans to have on his

inid-sem, don’t interr‘upt at all. And pleasel

don’t snicker when we tell her We were
studying in the stacks.

A position as switchboard operator is
ill the nature of a sacred trust. A dropsical
switchboard girl is worse than inadequate.
She can be a Florence Nightingale, soothing
our tortured brow, or a Borgia, slipping us
a Mickey. Reconsider your position, girls.
You can make or break this school.
