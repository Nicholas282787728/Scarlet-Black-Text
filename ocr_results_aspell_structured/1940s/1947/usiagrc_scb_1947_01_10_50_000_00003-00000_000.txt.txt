Grinnell, in part, ivill go south
in three weeks.

Several Grinnellians, to be sen
lectcd next week, will take a
semester's Icavc-of-‘lbsellce and
head for Hampton Institute of
Virginia. Hampton, a Negro col-
lege, will reciprocate by sending
reprosontatives from its student
body to this campus.

Located ’mld Virginia's historr
ical color, Hampton is not far
distant from Jamestown, York-
town, and Williamsburg, and can
boast of Booker T. Washington as
an alumnus. Hampton, founded in
1868, has grown from a modest
beginning to its present propon
tioue with course offerings in
eight diirisions, including both lib-
eral arts and vocational train-
ing.

Collins Huntington Davis, who
.graduated from Grinnell, is a
professor of chemistry and de-
partment head at Hampton.

More than 20,000 students have

attended Hampton Well aware of
the arts, Hampton has a lecture
‘series as well as frequent ron-
certs presented by the \chIrequip-
ped music department Many of
the buildings on the campus were
constructed by the students them-
selves while they were studying
in the school division of Trades
and Industries.

This student exchange program
is not new to Hampton. For sell:
cral ycars Hiram college, >Ohio,
has sent students to the Virginia
school, in this program to bring
about a greater understanding and
cooperation between races

Exhibil Expressionisﬁc Ar’r Works
Of Georges Rouau

II In Main Hall

i Prints by one of the most sig-
ln‘ icant and unorthodox artists of
this century, Georges Rouault.
comprise the January art ex-
hibit on view in Main Hall.
Houault, who survived the Ger
man occupation of France and, at
sevencyriour. is still there at work,
was one of the now famous
"Fauves" group of French exs
pressionist painters which start-
led the art world of Parisin 1905,
Rouaiilt exposed nir grave social
ills of his time, and all of his
paintings, regardless of subject,
reveal deep religious feeling. His
early experience as a worker in
stained glass greatly influenced
his work as can been seen in the
r_ic_h color and emphatic dark out-
lines characteristic of Rounult.

‘ This collection of etchings,
ithographs and wood-engravings
is being circulated by the Galerie
St Etienne, New York, and conv
tinues ehre through January 23.
