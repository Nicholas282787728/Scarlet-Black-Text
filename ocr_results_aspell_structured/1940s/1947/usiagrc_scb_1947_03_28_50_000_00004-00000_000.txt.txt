From The Norlh . . .

By John Barbour

Hello: You lucky people: Here
is the latest fashion news from
Your fashion magazine, MAD-
-AMOISSELLE ARMENTiiERs.
:Today, we're going to give yoi‘.
this spring’s fashions, informa-
tion on cosmetics, and the latest
news on how to keep your rigure
.trimmed.

The styles that have been dis-
played in New York and Paris
(Paris OOOH! Those post cardsl)
are really cut of this world, both
places being quite a distance from
Iowa, Today we will concentrate
on skirts, skirts, and DH! Those
'skirts drive me mad:

Shirts will be pleated, split
pleated. instead of the usual two
or three inch split pleat, this
year pleats will be split to the
waist. Colors will run (Not if you
use DUZ) to putrid puiple and
nasal green. The skirts will lean
toward materials of steel wool
and sacking, That way girls can
scratch in public without being
embarrassed. While the skirts
lean toward these materials, the
girls will lean toward the men,
Also, skirts will be longer, sonic
reaching almost to the thigh.

The latest dope in cosmetics in
a sensational new face cream
called “Old Crud". This delight-
ful concoction was brought to
this country by some of our dear
returnuig veterans, coming home
from the south sees. It isn’t very
hard to get and once obtained,
lasts a long time.

The best advice we can offer
concerning keeping that little old
figure trimmed is, don’t eat so
darned much. Exercising is nice,
too. When you awake in the mor-
ning, simply lie in bed for it few
minutes trying to think of a good
‘exouse for cutting your class.
Every few minutes raise your leg,
flex that New England boiled din-
ner on each calf, and let it fall.
Pretty soon, you’ll be so tired
you'll drop off to sleep again,
missing your breakfast.

That's all for this week, girlies.
Keep your girdles up!

Sklr’ring The Campus

. . . From The Soul‘h

By Mary Eugen and Ann Eicher:

Trends this spring tend tar
,ward being fuller with manyl
pleats or a longer, straight sil-l
houettc and small, dainty acces<l
sories. More accent will center on,
femininity with soft colors ofi
heiges and afﬂwhites, l

Red and green shoes are com—'
ing more into fashion, with reptile
going into the background and
softer leathers coming into first
position. Shoes will have closed
toes and heels. ,

Fabrics will lean towards soft
silks and crepes, and wools will
be more of soft suede texture

Bolts will be on 135 or 2 lnchl
widths. with some of 3 inch
crushable leathers. They will
have less trimming.

Interest will be centered on the
hipline and skirts will be fuller
and featuring pleats of all kinds,
accordion, box, inverted, and
kick. Skirts go to two extremes,
the very full, or long, narrow
silhouette. They will be 14 inches‘
from the ﬂoor.

Delicately tailored blouses will
trike the place of fancy trimmed
blouses.

Hats are affecting small, roundi
ed, and simple with much back
emphasis.

Again short hair is to be fea-
tured and this spring oomplr.
ions will be more fragile with
rosy tints instead or bright makes
