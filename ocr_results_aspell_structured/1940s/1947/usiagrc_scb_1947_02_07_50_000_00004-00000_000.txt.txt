Prove Too Much
For Pioneer Five

The Pioneer cage team dropped
a close game to the visiting Knox
five last Saturday night by a
score of 60-53. The loss was Grin-
nell's fourth in Midwest Confer-
ence competition.

Knox took a ten—point lead ini

the opening minutes, and the Scar-
let and Black hoopsters were new
or able to overcome this early
handicap. Throughout the rest of
the game the Purple and Gold
held an edge of from three to ten
points. Severoi times it seemed
as if Grinnell was about to take
the lead, but a Knox rally stop-
ped them on each occasmn, The
fast breaking attack of the visit-
ors and their deadly shooting
proved to be a little too much
for Ben Douglas boys to handle.
The biggest trouble-maker was
Cibbs, Knox mrward, who swish—
ed ten buckets and two free
throws through the hoop for a
total of t\ve‘nty»i.wo points. Al-
though he had a little trouble
getting the range at first, Earl
Pelsner rallied later to become
the Pioneer's high scorer with
sixteen points.
