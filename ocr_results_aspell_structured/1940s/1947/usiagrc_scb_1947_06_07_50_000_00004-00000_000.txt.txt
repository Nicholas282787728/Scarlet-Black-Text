bi: Through The Years

This commencement witnesses the end
of the teaching careers of three Grinncll
professors vhose experience on this came
pus totals eighty-seven years But the mere
measure of their time spent on the campus
‘c‘an never adequately express the efiect
these men have had on the college and on
the constant procession of men and women
who have made up the Grinnell student
body during the passing years.

Professor Bridgham

Professor John Merrill Bridgham has
spent nearly a quarter of a century at Grin-
nell, teaching Latin and Greek, Although
these subjects~once the core of a college
educationehave declined in importance for
several decades, Professor Bridgham has,
nevertheless, had aiwide acquaintance with
the student body, and his cheerful assiste
once in the matter of lost and found articles
has aided many an anxious but careless
students

Professor Ryan
In the classroom or off campus, that
" ’eable gent we call Professor Ryan re-
n nds us of all that embodies friendliness.
sincerity, and spi ti He has Grinnell and
its students in his heart, and we will ale
ways save a spot for him in our. hearts
From his sensible philosophy of life to his
famous formula “Plan your work and work
your plan” he has shown us how to grow,
and how- to develop. And what could be
more important than health ’15 he constantv
1y reminds us? He exemplifies his beliefs
(2, npletely, and We admire him and appree
, ciate him for it.
‘ Professor Wood
After more than two decades as head
of the English department ‘Drl Paul Spencer
Wood is retiring this year. His students
and colleagues will remember him as a ro-
bust, wise, and kind man. In the classroom
he has displayed a wide and profound lit—
eitary 'scholarship vitalized by a farereaoh-
mg mind and sympathetic interpretation.
Together with his teaching, he has written
and edited several significant books. Despite
his unceasing labors as a teacher and a
scholar, he has devoted himself to the en—
richn-ient of campus life, especially has he
been interested in varsity athletics and the
'Friars. Dr. Wood has stood for hi h stand~
ards of scholarship which he has demon-
mated are not incompatible with sociability
nd versatility

Keep it Up,

When Grinnell College adopted the
shoe, “The Pioneers" it did so with good
ason. This is no meaningless title. It

‘ an epithet backed now by one hundred

years of “firstness” which has become a
'adition. We are proud of the fact that
rini-iell is quick to recognize and test new
cos, and the extent of the valuable edu»
tional territory explored and occupied by
rinnellians proves that the Pioneers have
en successful in practice as well as iil
eory.

Those of us who \\ ere on campus last

uary were privileged to witness the

, ding of a new piece of ground. When Mae
dud Marie came from Hampton Institute to
§pend a semester at Grinnell, we establish
ed ourselvesipermanently, we thought—
f‘h an area to which the college had long
given lip service, the field oi" social dee
iiiocracy.

which the Hampton girls carry back from
Griniiell will bear the stamp oi" an experience
in the brotherhood of mankind, an experi~
once made as fine as two top-notch people
could make it. All four of the girls are
eager for the exchange to continue.
Hampton students, faculty, and ad-
ministration liave all g"'cn their acti e

support to an exchange for next semester.‘

Grinnell students are ostensibly very much
in favor of the same thing. Our faculty
and administration seem to agree with us.
It is an incredible thing, then, that no ac-
tion has been taken. The faculty committee
appointed consists of four members, two of

Unless we take the initiative and take it
right away, we may lose all the territory
we have gained in the past semester. The
social democracy for which Grinnell purports
to stand may become as meaningless as
confederate money. Hampton has done its

Mellow Valedictorian

Fellow Students, I salute ‘ou! In these
Perilous Times, sailing betwixt the Rock—
Strewn Coast of Childhood and the Hidden
Shoals of our Chosen Profession, we
should be doubly, triply appreciative of the
Wonderful Advantages which have been
offered to us at Grilinell.

This school has been our Beacon Ligh
to guide us safely thru the RockeStrewn,
Shoals and Hidden Coasts of Life. l

And I say life advisedly, for most of us
have yet to Li e. Not until we can say
proudly that we have drunk deep of the
foaming brew of Knowledge offered by our
Alma Mater, not until then can we say
that we have begun to Live Life and Live
it as it should be Lived.

In our hands is the Future of Tomor-
row and the Future of Tomorrow’s Future.
It is up to us, Graduates of 1947, to take
Life by the Throat and pursue an Even
Course tliru the Shoals and Stuff I mention
ed earlier without breaking the Flask which
they have passed to us. With that Proud
Beacon blazing, how can we avoid sailing
safe into the Port which lies ahead?

Think of all the opportunities Gii’nnell
has given us! The i .
and the opportunities to
prepared us for Life, given us some faint
hint, ‘some glimmering, casting the White
Light of T
we are to face.

Let,us not be tempted to forget them.
Let us forge bravely ahead, cut'our Life
paths sure and straight. Keep your eyes
on that beaker . . that Beacon. Have the
Mixture True. Disdain the Homebrewed
Half-Truths! Have the courage to propose
a Toast as you lift your glass on high. Grine
nell! . . . Three Cheers and a Tiger!

show an incl-ease at at least 15

‘Elel', only 20 students, 12 men
and 8 women withdrew mom the
‘college. When combined with the
students who dropped out during.
the first semester, the total for"
the year becomes 40 or 4,3 per

age loss. The loss at present stur
