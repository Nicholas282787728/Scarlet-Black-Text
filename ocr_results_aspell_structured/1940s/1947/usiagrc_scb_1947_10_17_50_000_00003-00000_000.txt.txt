Langan Preps ‘Backward’
As Tug -O’— War Looms

Last Wednesday morning pro-
duced a strange group of areas
tures who not only didn't know
if they were coming or going,
(their shirts racing where they
had been), but who sported the
keenest looking bow tics A real
Joe Collcge stuit, Not only that,
but the casual observer (a block
away) might have had the im-
pression that the Langan preps
were bad boys. i

This select group,
upon closer investigation, was
leading a “back to the sensible
clothes" movement, which we
were assured would soon sweep
coilege campuses throughout the
nation even more thoroughly
than those female atrocities a!»
fectionately known as skirts.
However, a oneday trial failed
to produce any converts, and the
consensus was that the alarms};—
ioned male styles are here to stay.
(All of which proves that the
ways of upperclassmen vary as
the square of the prepping they!
went through.) i

Later in the day, a roll or
iinimse interrupted our sound
sleep inside the trash can next
to the bookstore. and we were
duly impressed as several volun-
teers announced that another in
the timeehonored series of bloody
tilts peculiar to the Crinneil spe-
cies of beast-worshippers willl
take place again tomorrow ar-i
ternoon. Carefully picked prep
teams from Dibble and Clark
halls will vie on the ﬁeld of
battle for the honor of one wee
rodent, namely a skunk.

Just where or when this an-’
cient form of mayhem originated
we‘re not sure. Suttiee to say
that generations of loyal Dibble,
Smith and Langan men have will—
ingly laid down their lives for
such glorious trophies as mangy
eagles, a flea-bitten owl, and a
dirty old tombstone. No ancestor-
worship for us. We're enlighened.

outdone, have blossomod out with.

. strange that the fad is lim-‘

Also on the freshman fashiolli
angle, one upperciass sage put it
well when he stated that the only
way‘you can tell a prep girl 15‘
by the length of her skirt or the
feather duster in her hair.

Ties are not restricted to the
males any longer either. An
abundance of scarves, bows, and
what have you are appearing
around the female neck.

sloppy sack dresses have hit a
