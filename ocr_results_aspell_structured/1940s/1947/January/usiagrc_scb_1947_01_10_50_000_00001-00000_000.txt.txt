A
Friends' Service committee head-
quarters was received this week
by the Board of Religion thank-

card from the American

ing Gi-innell students for their
contribution of 237 pounds at
clothing given in the pro-Christ-

AFSC clothing shipments to
needy countries from Jan. 1 to
Nov. 15, 1940, totaled about‘620
tons ( approximately 11/: million

12 foreign countries. The distribu»
tion of this clothing among the
needy of these countries brought
much needed relief to many, but
they were but a small percentage
of the many more stil desperate-
