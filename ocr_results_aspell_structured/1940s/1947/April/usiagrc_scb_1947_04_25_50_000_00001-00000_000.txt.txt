intelligence." A poem does not

the result perhaps of childhood ex~
pfriences, environment, or other
associations.

The poet must have the ability
to retain these experiences and
put them into ivords, Poems,
then, are built around key words
which suggest and grow into the
substance of the poem. “The
source begins every time a poet
accumulates a scrap of experience

 

relevant to some ultimate experl-
encc which results in a poem."
He added that “a. singlc well!
may be a, small, buried poem",
and the poet’s imagination shapes
it into the many meanings,

Mr. Engle read several of h
own poems, some of thcm unpulr
lishcd, and poems by Robert Penn
Warren and Carl Sandburg. he
concluded by saying “The Source
of poetry is everywhere, in any
t g that is in tho subject of
human apprehension.”

Prepping ScOpe 'ls Increasiad
in North CampusiVoting

Paddles Refurned
In 26l-l53 Ballo’r

Prepping, in a modified form,
is again with the Pioneer student
body. Walter Brennecke, presie
of the Council of House
Presidents, announced Tuesday
the lclllslatement of prepping on
north campus, effective immedi-
ately follownig his announcement.

The members of the C of HP
voiced the opinion that “the pri-
mary purpose of the installation
of prepping rules is to regulate
constructively the extra-curricu-
lar activities of freshmen, and to
and them in gaining acadamic
and social Stability.”

Monday evening at house meet~
ings the men’s halls voted on
prepping, and the resultant major-
ity of 261 to 153 in favor was
sufficient to effect the return of
the regulations, through the co-
operation of the freshmen, up»
pcrclassmen, C of HP, and the ad-
ministration, \

The major innovations in the
new prepping rules are those con-
cerning the use of paddles by au-
thorized hall representatives, and
the practice of buttoniug by the
pl‘eps,‘ with the remainder of the
program basically the same as

‘ivas voted in last fall.
