Forty years ago this fall a young his-
ins riictor from Indiana _'0ined the
. iiell faculty. He brought with him the
6 he and ability to teach, a devotion to his
c‘iosen subject, an incxtinguishablc courage
aid determination, and a lively interest in
people and what they did.
in the years of war and peace follow—
iZ g hi ar val, the man’s thought and study
\. ie more: ingly attracted to the history
<- the present day. This was eventually re-
i‘ected in the college catalogue by the an—
:ouncement of a new course, to be called
centenipm'ary history.
Con need of the ultimate necessity for
.i international organization, he sought
'ougli the means at his disposaliby wi tr
irg, speaking, and teaching—to further in-
nationl understanding and cooperation
doing the discouraging period after 1918,
\.‘ieii this country was attempting to ignore
ti e rest of the world.
His preparation for these controversies
- ‘ltl classes never ceased, and the range and
.iantity of his reading was formidable. He
)- ought to his work an instinctive bias for
t: e underdog, for the unpopular side of a
' iblic question.
Although hepossessed a keen sciisitivee
less for the human element in history, and
in understanding sympathy for the stu-
dents who caineito him for aid or advice,
["5 char cter \ias balanced by a native
:rewdne and senre of the practical that
ibled him to 1 ' serve a hopeful, optim-
tic perspective in the confusion of his
tines.

His classes were poular in spite oi his
mutation for for rigorous grading, An
. ependeiit thinker himself, he sought to

nirture in his students a similar independ-
e‘ e of thought based on a knowledge of
t e wailable information and an under
s:anding of the human groups involved. He
i s anything but a doctrinaire, but he saw
' . the course of history repeated evidence

an uiiquenchahle hope in mankind for a
ligttei- world, accompanied by a gradual iine
li-‘orenient, irregular but persistent, in
ii n's e teiice. This hope and growth he
ied to indicate to his classes . . .

That was what his study of history
i’ltl taugli him, But it was the sight of
liofessor Payne, sitting on a cushion on his
chair at the rent of the room, confessing

's hope, his cane hung on the chalk rack
behind him, that convinced his students,

student world, particularly to the ideWest

conference.

Other colleges have felt the need for
improved intro-conference relations. While
Griiinellians were weeping in their lunch-
cons and wondering who would pay the car-
penter, students at Coe devised a plan for
exchange of students between conference
schools. The results of the appl'oacliingcon-

ventions and of our own survey will showI

which policy is the better founded

The next two weeks will offer us “Pi—l
oneers” a chance not only to show what
Grinnel has that’s good, but to see what
other schools have that’s better. It's time

Impasse On Drinking Rules

Student officers have a responsibility
and an obligation to those whom they re-
present. It is to represent them truly, not
merely in a functional sense by presiding at]
housemeetiiigs and enforcing rules, but byl
sounding out the general temper of the,I
student body, iecognizing any signs of dis,
satisfaction, and dealing honestly and ob-
jectively with whatever problems may arise.

Their fellow students, on the other
hand, also have an obligation to them: that

to recognize both the powers and the
limitations of student organizations, such
as the League Board.

No student organ ation is all-powerful
in all spheres, In some Iields, it can determ-
ine, independent of other agencies, its own
course of action. In others, it can serve only
as a medium for expressing student opinion.
with iecommendations as to what action
should be taken. The final decision in such
1: l s with the admin tration, which, in‘l
tuiii, has a di‘l respoiiSibility: to recognize;
the student \ '11 and yet to maintain the!
staiidaids of the college.

Although the student leadeis change
every ycai, the college has a continuous \-
istence.

A problem h recently arisen which
involve. all these ac on. that is, the wo-
men" drinking rule. The poll taken by the
League Board to determine the \iomen's
attitude on this problem revealedthat the
inaioi'ity ol' the women ii ere in Favor of a
drinking rule, but a more lenient one than
that that now in iorce. Were a more satisA
factor rule to be disco ered, the League
lioard could not institute it independently.

This is a problem which must go
through the administration. The results
of the poll \ieie presented to that bodv
The drinking rule has not been changed.
Why? To the administration, the problem
is much more complex than to the individ-
ual student. It must consider the e. ting
clauses about drinking contained in leg
as well as.the attitude of parents and trust-
ees. Moreover, a change in the drinking
rule would affect the entire tone of the sole
lege.

An institution, like an individual, must
be based on certain moral principles. It
cannot change them according to every
fluctuation of student opinion.

These, then, are the reasons that the
drinking rule has not been changed. From
our personal viewpoiii , we, as students, may
not ag ee. However, in this case, the ad-
ministi tion feels that the popular will must
be tempered to fit the standar . of the col»
lege,
