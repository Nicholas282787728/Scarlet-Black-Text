Through The Crys’ral Ball -'—

The bell released from class rooms all the
vital young energy that had been shut there—
in for the last fifty minutes. Like an ex-
plosion, freshmen, juniors, sophomores, sen-
iors, 7 men and women, —— emerged from
their mental labors to enjoy a few minutes

of relaxation. Into the bright spring sun»
shine tlley poured, the men in the front of
the building and the women ill the back,
each leaving through a special exit, marked
“men” 0 ' “women”. A new student, confused
by his 1' st‘ days at Grinnell, inadvertently
started to follow the laughing young women,
but was kindly and instantly corrected byi'
the shrill whistle of a traffic cop.

Music blared from the windows of the1
hall club room. Obviously, open house wasi
in progress. Brilliant searchlights picked outi
the swaying forms of dancers, frolicking to!
the gay strains of the mandolin as they lost‘
themselves in the beauties of the statelyI
milluet. From one Corner of the club room,‘
the young men occasionally interrupted their
game of marbles to glance at a group of
girls, absorbed in a game of jacks outside
the housemother’s suite. An eagle screamed,
and its anguished call was answered, far
down the loggia, by the dying hoot of an
old white owl. ,

It was closing hours at the quad, and:
the nightly ritual of sad partings was again3
being touchingly enacted. As the young;
people came slowly up the walk, their stepsl
lagged, as reluctantly they prepared to say
goodnight. The long receiving line formed,i
and each girl passed slowly down it,'perhapsl
giving an extra pressure to the hand of her
beloved as she passed him. The high pol
tentate of college morals, enthroned on Main
hall steps, wiped away a tear of joy. . .such
sweet young love.
