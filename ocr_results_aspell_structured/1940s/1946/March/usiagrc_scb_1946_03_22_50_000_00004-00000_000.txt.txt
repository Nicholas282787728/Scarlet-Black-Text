Finds Gridmen Indoors;

Spring tootball, originally schee
dulcd for mid—March, has been
postponed until April 10, ac-
cording to a recent announcement,
by Coach Ben Douglas. Equip-
ment will be issued to the play-
ers on April 9 so as to assure
plenty of time for the first work-
out.

Many of the prospective foot-
ball players have already spent,
their free afternoons working out
in Darby gym with the track‘
tcam, loosening tight muscles to;
avoid the usual charley-horses
that accompany the first drills.

About forty men are expected
for the initial turn-out, Probably
missing will be Kermit Steinbeck,
quarterback, who played for the
pioneers before his navy days.
steinheck is expected to undergo
an operation on a trick knee dur—
