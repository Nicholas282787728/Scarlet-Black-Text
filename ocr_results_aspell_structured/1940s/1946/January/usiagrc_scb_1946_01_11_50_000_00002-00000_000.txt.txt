We would suggest, before there is too
much unnecessary hot air blown about over
the raise in charges for housing at Grinnell,
that students take into consideration the
very important fact that for each student
in Grinnell, the college spends from $350
to $400 more than we pay. If the college
has decided that in the face of rising prices,
it must ask the student to pay more so as
not to increase this gap between income and
cost, we have no legitimate gripe,

There is no provision that would pre
vent students from working to make up the
difference between the old rate and the
ne '. To earn $37.50 per semester, less than

Peace . . .
and‘ Happy New
Year, people. We hope you've
recovered sufficiently from all
those parties to give us a few
paltry minutes of your time.
We‘don't know about you-s11,
but werall made one big New
Year’s resolutio as follows:

We are going to be sweet from
now on in this column, and we’re
really going to try, too, so bear
with us now and then if we kind
of slip off ’the track a little.

Also we made some predictions
on coming events 7 guess every-
one does right about this time.

1. Murdock will find himself
a nice little gal, and live
happily ever after, if the
Marshalltuwn draft board
doesn’t let him down.

sidies.

But while we're on the subject of college,
employment . . . there‘s something that has
been bothering us for a lonl;r time. As
wages rise all over the country, payment for
college employment stays at the same old
level. The beginning pay of 326 per hour
is low, and after a student has Worked for
three years, he is earning only 38c per
hour.

Most college jobs aren’t llartl. They are
scheduled so that a student may fit them
into his program, and, they last only a few
hours a day at the most, but wages look
pretty puny after a slimmer job that pays,
at very minimum wages, 400 and may go
as high as a dollar or more.

There is no reason that the college
should pay the unreasonable wages dc—
manded in many cases by organized labor.
Work incentive, however, would be greatly
increased if payment for college employment
were raised at least to the national minie
mum. Students who now work as many
hours as they can possibly schedule, who
need to work to pay their way through
college, could more easily meet the rise in
cost of living at Gi‘innell if they could earn
a few more cents for every hour they work.

That should not be objectionable to the
auditors who find that Grinn’ell pays more
for housing than it collects from the Stm
dents, Payment for college employment‘
comes out of another fund. The books in
the treasure 5 office might look prettier
to these gentlemen if more expenditure
were listed under college employment, and
less under housing.

My dear Miss Warren:
May 1 congratulstc you on the
recent editorial entitled “College

Democracy" in which the Negro

problem at Grinnell was discussed.
It is well thought out, well writ-
ten, end the Whole editorial pre-
sents in a very few words n
problem that is real and vital.
if you wrote it, may I con—
gratulate you on the sane think-
ing you are doing, if another-
wrote it, kindly tell the writer
for me that he did a fme job,

1 was in the class of 1906. In
the class of 1904. was a Negro
who lived ivith us, a tinc athlete,
a fine student, who later I think
became a fine doctor. 1 know
that he was a perfect gentleman
and that my gcneration of stu-,
dents got an ideal of the Negro
race from him that has stayed
with us for life

Personally, I feel it is a fine
thing to have men and women
of other races living on the cam—
pus. It helps more thanahundred
lectures on democracy, for in
living contact with men and wo-
men of other races, we learn to
respect their true inner values.
The world is in a sorry state and
if our colleges, which produce our
thinkers and leaders, cannot live
within the college campus coin
fines the democracy they hear
from the platform, then there is
no hope for the world and no use
in going on with what we call
civilization, The times demand
thst we live what he bclieve,

At any rate, it shows that you
are ,doing some real thinkingl
along lilies that are most vital to'
the future of the world. Keep it
up.

’ sincerely,
