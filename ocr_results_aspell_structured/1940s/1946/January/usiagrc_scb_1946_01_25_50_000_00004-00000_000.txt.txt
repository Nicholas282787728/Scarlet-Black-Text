GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

PIONEER QUINTET PRIMED
FOR KNOX GAME TONIGHT

Climaxing a Week of hard,
workouts, the Grinnell basket-
ball live will meet the Knox

college quintet here tonight. This
college clash will be the final half
of the double—header program
which is planned tor the evening,
The Crinnell nigh-Newton
will lead off the two-game card,
which begins at 7 o'clock.

The college team will be seek-

ing its second conference victory
in the game with Knox, which
will be the sixth loop contmt for
the Pioneers. As yet Knox has
played no conference games.

The Grinnellians should be in
good shape for tonight's battle,
despite the fact that they are
handicapped by injuries. Larry

Moloney. starting guard, was laid
up early this week by a sore foot,
and forward Bill Findley receiv~
ed a hand injury in practice Mon-
day afternoon. Both players Will

probably be in shape for the.
Knox contest.

According to statistics, Knox
and Crinnell should be evenly

matched, and the game should be
hard fought most of the way.

Pioneers Lose To Belolt
Last Friday night in the Dar-

by gym, the Pioneers dropped a
tough game to‘ the Beloit college

team. The final tally was, 52
for Beloit, and 35 for the home
team.

Dean DeWitt, ‘ Pioneer guard,
led the offense for the Grmnellr
ians with 15 points, while Pete
Kcstantacos, Beloit guard, paced
the winners with 19 points to his
credit.

During the second half of the
contest, the local cagcrs held the
visitors to 21 points while collect-
ing 19. This Closely played final
period was full of thrills as the
Pioneers threatened Beloit sever-
al times. But the tall Cold five
maintained their lead to hand the
Crinnell team their fourth Mid-
west conference loss.
