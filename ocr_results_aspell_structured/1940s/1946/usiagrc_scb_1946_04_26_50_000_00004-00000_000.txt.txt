Many a Grinnellian last week
ignored the 9:00 am. mail tusslel
in order to watch the antics of
Honor c. initiates, Herb White,
Jim Gadient, Jack Chaffee. Larry
Maloney. Bob W'Illamson, Bob
Eaton, and “Dble' Nelson. Many
a professor, leaning on his' digs

added his applause and kindly
overlooked tardy class entrances.

Garhcd in everything from bur-
lap bags, diapers. and sheets. to
tails, white drawers, (on, Jim.
how we loved those lacy, mono-
grammed ones!) and Gay Nine-
ties mustaches, these stalwart
lads showed the school that they
possess both talent and well»turn-
ed ankles rolled up into one big
athletic hunk.

Climaxing their between-class
skits ‘with one stupendous Little
Theater performance of “If Men
Played Bridge Like Women,” the|
husky brutes brought the week's
entertainment to a convulsive
close. Pursonally, we ain‘t laffed
so hard since the hawg at Grand-
