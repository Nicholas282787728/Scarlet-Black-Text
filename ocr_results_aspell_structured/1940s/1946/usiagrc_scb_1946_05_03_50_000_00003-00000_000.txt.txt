Almost a foreigner now in her
native U. 5., Miss Carol Westaby,
lnew Main hostess, is releal‘nlllg‘
lAmeriCan geography at Crinnell.
’Miss Westaby, whoserhome is
Madison, South Dakota, rctiiined
recently from Europe, where she
has been working With the Red
Cross. setting up recreational fac
ilities for service men

Beginning her work in England.
she assisted in organizing a cone
ter for the Eighth Air Force, and
was transferred to Holland dur
mg the Battle of the Bulge. In a
cafe in a large Dutch city, she:
set up the Duteh Treat Club for
returning front line troops.

When she was no longer need
ed in Holland, Miss Westaby or
ganized a club in Hildeshime,
iGel-many, for returned prisoners
ior wa "We used a German Luft-
waffe field, and took over what
was left of the officers’ Club." The
windows and doors were blown out
but with the help of three other
Red Cross workers and some of
the men, it was made into an at.-
‘tractive center, which handled 10,-
000 men a day. They also set up‘
several temporary centers, some-
times in requiSltioned buildings.
sometimes even in tents, where
and when they were needed.

l Her week’s leave on the Riviera;
was “perfect". While there, she‘
had a better opportunity to see
French fashions than she had in
Paris. 'The fashionable girl wore
very distinctive eye makeup,” she.
lsaid, “and the girls had beenl
dying their hair bliie,‘ lavender.
orange, and pink, but the most
popular hair color was slate grey."

Amazed at the current Paris
trend toward vely large, flowingi‘
sleeves, full skirts, and wide belts;
she told me that, ”Any Frenehl|
woman could take anything and
make a. dress of it," Garments di5r
carded by the Americans werel
dyed, recut. and made into high.‘
fashion clothing. ‘

The'sudden trend toward very.
ridiiculous hats during the Ger-
man occupation has been explain-
ed by the fact that the French
,knew the Germans would take‘
with them many Paris hats ,for
their wives, and the French want-
ed them to appear foolish How»
ever, the French women grew to
like the distorted hats. and [her
‘fashlon remained even after the‘
Germans left.
