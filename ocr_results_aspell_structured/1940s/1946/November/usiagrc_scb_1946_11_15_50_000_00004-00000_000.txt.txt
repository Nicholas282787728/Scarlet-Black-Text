Cold, Mud, Help Pioneers In 13-2 Carl Defeat

TO MEET COLORADO
IN SEASON WIND-UP

By Bob Clabhy

A cold rain and a super-muddy
field failed to halt the offensive
power of Grinnell‘s gridmen, as
the Pioneers ran the gantlet of.
bad weather and emerged with a
13 to 2 victory over Carleton

college on Ward field last Sate
urday. The game marked the end
of the conference competition, and
closed the home season for the
Scarlet and Black.

The first quarter opened with
Carleton receiving the kick-offlon
their own 16 and running the ball
back to their 25, only to lose it
to Crinnell on a fumble recover—
ed by Mel White. Throughout the
remainder of the quarter the Pier
necrs held a slight advantage, bntl
the first period ended with no
score.

An amphibious second quarter
started with Crinncll in posses—
sion of the pigskin on their own
as. Runs by Nagel, Thellman, and
Webb carried the ball to the
Carleton 24, where Steinbeck took
over and, in a fine exhibition of
lirokcn field running, crossed the
Carleton goal standing up, for the
initial score of the game. Nagle
converted and the score stoodi
Grinnell 7, Carleton, o

The Pioneer kick-off was
tumbled by Carleton and the ball
again rested in scoring territory
for the home team. The Crinnell
attempt for a second touchdown

was halted by a determined Carle-
ton line on their three yard stripe.
The visitors kicked out of dan-
ger to their 40, wherc Steinbeck
and company took over for the
remainder of the quarter. Thc
gin sounded, and the half ended
with Crinnell leading, 7 to o,
Crinnell's opening kick-off in
the second half rolled into the
and zone, was taken by Carleton

on tt 20, and quick-kicked to
the Pioneer 40, where Steinbeck
rcceiicd and returned the ball to
tho Crinnell 49. A series of
fumbles resulted in Carleton’s
gaining possession of the ball on
the mid-field stripe. At this stage,
Carreto—i's kick went out of
ho. nds on the Crinnell 16 yard
lino.

Then the Pioneer griddcrs open-
ed up. An opening through Carle-
tom's left tackle provided ’Big
Eli' ngle with the opportunity
to outrun the entire Carleton
team (with the assistance or Mel
White and a good block) and
Naglc crossed the Carloton goal,
tired, but standing. Nilgle’s try
for extra point was bl , ed, and
the Pioneers led the Carleton
sq no. 13 to 0.

The remaining minutes of the
game saw a safety scored by
Car eton on a blocked Crinnell
kick, and the gun went off, giving
the Pioneers a 12 to 2 victory
over the visiting Carleton team.

on the basis of past games,
Gl‘lllltell is definitely the favorite,

in both backfield and line, In
the series which ended in 1941,

Colorado, having won three games
and tied one. In tho opinion of

, game this year was a 7-7 tie with
Montana State.

The team making the trip is
substantially the same which has
