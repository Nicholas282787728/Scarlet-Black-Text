he Lights Go On Again - -

Today, north campus lives again. The
lights ill the tower windows shine after ale
most two years of bleak darkness. The
stream 01' ARH-bound ,students is almost as
full as that from the quad. Cowles dining
room begins to fulfill its planned fullctioni
that of feeding- a large number of men stun
dents. Plans are nearing completion to re-
turn north campus’ guests to their rightful
abode in the qpad next fall.

This week, the five men’s halls elected
house councils among- which they named
Student Council representatives, and their
house elections democratically confirmed
appointive presidents in halls which had not
previously had a chance to name their
heads. Together, these ‘five presidents
named a president of the C of HP. In addie
tion to their previous organizations, this
year Grinnell men have at hand another
group unique in Grinnell history, for which
many of them are eligible the very
active and vocal Anchors and Eagles. The
men are now organized to assume their
share of campus government and responsi-

 

bility. ‘

The women welcome a chance to re-
linquish some of the responsibility which
has been theirs for so long: Grinnell women
3 e not militant feminists. They did not
attempt to entrench themselves so firmly
in student government, publications, and
organizations that the men would have a
tough fight for position when they returned.
Had they aimed to do so, they would have
had a rude awakening.

But the women had valuable experience
during the war years in entering fields that
had previously been limited by custom to
the stronger sex. They have profited, and
will 111‘ to better Conwol‘kel‘s in campus or-
ganizations because they now understand
the problems involved.

They will, we predict, step gracefully
aside to let the men take their places be-
side theniﬁthat they will be content to com—
pletely yield their new found leadership
uould be a most dangerous statement, and
one which the S&B ll'ou'ldn’t make on a bet!
It must be a compromise, with women re—
ceiving- cousideration for every office which
they have competently filled during. the wal'
years.

Siymied - -

Last week we advocated ill these columns
a postponement of Student Council elections
until there has been a chance for new stu-
dents to become an integral part of the
college. We find that on this point we are
completely stymied. It seems that there is
a Constitutionaa sacred document which,
ill small but powerful type, proclaims in no
uncertain terms that League Board elections
must be held before spring vacation.

The League Board president must be
elected before the rest of the League Board
and it is only sensible to fill the most ilne
pol-tant job, that of Student Council presi-
dent, fiist of all . . . so that election must
be held before the League Board president
is elected. All of which means that all
these elections must be completed within
about six weeks, and must therefore get
rolling soon.

It will be nice to have spring vacation
early, so we can get back and get things
cleaned up before the Centennial revelry
starts But we find it hard to respect a con-
stitution that bases an election date on any~
thing- So subject to the whims of circum-
stance as Spring vacation.

 

Beiser To Speak
On "Catholicism",

Final speaker in the current
Board of Religion series to pro—

mote religious tolerance through
knowledge will be Father Beiser
of the University of Iowa, school
of religion who will be at ’Grln—
nell next Thursday, Feb. 21.

Father Beiser will speak
Herrick chapel at 10:00 a. m. on
the general topic of Catholicism.
He is a member of the universi—
ty faculty and teaches courses in
the Catholic religion.

A colleague of Father Beiser's
in the university school of re-
ligion, Dr. Marcus Bach, opened
the series three weeks ago with
a. talk on Protestant sects. The
second speaker in the group was
Rabbi Herman Schaalman, who
spoke in chapel yesterday on
Judaism imd iis contributions to
democracy.

In outlining these contributions,
Rabbi Schaalman polluted out that
traditional Judaism had con~
mbuted early in humun develop-
ment the twin ideas of adult ed-
ucation and private preyer (pray-
er directly addressed be a diety
without an intermediary priest).
Both of these ideas, he conclud<
ed, have added to the general
idea. of human lreedom which is
basic to democracy.
