Next Monday’, when the first home basketball

game of the season takes place in Darby gym. the
girls will coyly move to the east bleachers while
the flower of Grinnell’s manhood will ignore those
come-hither looks and range themselves on the
west bleachers. This masterful display of indepen-
dence by North Campus residents will be enforced
by catcalls and ridicule for each weakling who,
entangled in the web of some he—Jeaned temptress,
chooses to sit with his date. Their weakness is an
insult to Grinnell pioneers; their conduct. pure
heresy. >

Like most long-continued traditions, this sep-
aration of the sexes at Grinnell basketball games is
founded in reason. for no man can pay attention to
the game while giving proper attention to his date,
and practically no Grinneil girl has ever watched a
basketball game with the intensity shown by a
Grinnell man. Long ago it was established that the
sexes, of right ought to be, and thereafter, in fact.
were, seated on opposite sides of the floor.vThls
procedure has proved so necessary and desirable
that it has never been successfully fl‘outetzl except
by occasional publicityaseeking exhibitionists who
failed to understand the ultimate rightness of the
procedure.

New students, therefore, are hereby warned
not to take dates to Monday's game unless they
wish to experience the Saulrshivering vocal dis-
pleasure of Honor G, supported in spirit and voice
by all true members of the North Campus body
politic.

Think. . .Give. . .

Some students in the world are not worrying
about what their hours for Saturday night will
be: some people in the world are not worrying
about whether they will have creamed eggs or
roast beef for dinner; these people have more or.

gent problems, The people in the ravaged countries
of Europe and Asia are suffering from cold and
hunger and lack of shelter. Despite the momentary
discomfort due. to the coal strike, the United
States is the only country in the world able to
extend aid to these people.

In keeping with this season of giving, the
Board of Religion is inaugurating two relief drives.
A clothing drive for the American Friends Service
Committee will begin tomorrow. and the WSSF‘

try to outdo our previous record.

was no easy task to wrestle withl
those donkeys, and we would like
to express publicly our sincere
thanks to all those who particia

feeling to know that our faculty
can enjoy a laugh at its own
expense. Let us hope that the
sore muscles are limber again
and that the only scars are those
upon the dignity of the faculty.

To the “girls” of the Honor G,‘
thanks for a stunning style show
and for two hard fought games
Next year we'll see if we can’t
get a tame donkey for Stubbee.
The girl's Canter club certainlyl
gave ample proof that they know
more about riding than simply
how to take a quiet Sunday morn-
ing jog around the park. To them
go our thanks for being such fine
sports.

You will be interested to know
