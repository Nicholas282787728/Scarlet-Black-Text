Security Patrol

Duty Beg

by John Wylie

Members or the Campus Security
Patrol will begin work on North
and South Campus tonight, as con
cern about security continues.

Dean of Student Affairs Conney
Kimho explained to the S315 that
the twelve member palrol will co-
ver the residence halls between
lo pm. and 6 am. Friday through
Sunday.

Patrol members met yesterday
with Kimbo, Physical Plant Director
Dale Hawn, and Police Chief Bill
Peters for a briefing about their
jobs.

Basically, patrol members will
make certain that doors are locked
and will check identification before
admitting anyone without a key.

Kimbo explained that, while check-
ing lD cards would not be a popular
move, it was necessary ii the new
security system was to be effective;

Patrol members will be centrally
linked to the campus operator lh—
rough the pager system which air
ready serves Buildings and Grounds
workers.

They will be equipped with flash-
lights and keys to operate the crash
doors on both campuses in addition
to the pagers.

Sunday evening and proceeded to du-
estion, evaluate and vote ior next
year’s hall officers.

winning presidencies. In the vice-
presidehcy, the trend was Just the
opposite with 13 women vice-presi-
dents and 6 men.

New hall officers are predomine

ins Tonight

nesday Hawn estimates damage at
about $300,

Hall President John Hansen said
he heard the crash of the window
being broken, followed by the sounds
of two people fleeing towards the
Physical Education Complex.

Grinneli Police, who are investi-
gating the incident, feel that a Gri-
nell student or Students were prob
ably responsible. in the words of
one of the investigating officers,
"all the trouble makers we know
about are apparently hometonight".

Hansen noted that almost an hour
elapsed between the time he repor»
ted the incident tothe camousooera-
‘tor and the time a and watchman
could be located,

Huwn explained that the watchman’s
paging unit had apparently mallunce
tioned, probably due to faulty batterr
ies

Hawn added that his investigation
oi an earlier incident in Norris,
involving the theft of $25.00 in pen—
nies, has revealed that a BM} watr
chmun was partially at fault.

Although he does not feel the watr
chman was completely to blame,
Hawn told the SALE Thursday that
the money will be replaced out of
the Physical Plant budget ifthe cur-
rent police investigation fails toree
cover the money.

Police Chief Bill Peters reported
no new leads in the case.

Kurz Examines New [PC Post

Lenny Kurz was elected allecame

tional Policies Committee on rrie
day, and he was looking for the
right words to describe his view of
the job.
Finally. he iouhd them in a small

l-le prefaced his discussion by note
ing that the energy crisis was not

a new thing, but rather that scien-
tists have been discussing it ior
years. He cited a meetingoi the
American Chemical Society in 1921
where the "energy crisis” of that
time Was debated.

But Larson conceded that what we
are tacing today is a critical shor-
tage of petroleum, one that will
"really make its lull effects knr
own by this summer".

Pal-t oi the problem is that the
average American is using 90 kil»
owatt hours of energy per day, or
the equivalent oi the labor of 90
human beings.

At this rate, Larson noted, we
are using up every year petioles

um that required one million years
to produce. “And we obVlously can’t
last long, using it up at that speed,”

But, by depending on nuclear gen
eration of electricity. it would be
possible to meet man’s forseeable
needs ior power while conserving
petroleum for transportation, whe
ere there is no known substitute.
Larson spent much oi his address
deiending nuclear reactors against
charges levelled by environmental
groups that the plants are both uns
safe and major sources of pollur
tion.

He contended that they are safer
and treer irom pollution than any
other method of generating power,
Modern technology has made the
possibility of a nuclear accident
almost nonrexistant, and has allo-
wed for extremely efficient use of
uranium fuels.

ironically, Larson noted, environ
mental groups were responsible ior
the intitial push for nuclear plants,
which they were now opposing. Drie
ginally, they saw them as a viable
alternative to coal fired plants, wh-
ich emit large Quantities of pollu-
tants.

Larson concluded his address by
stressing that the major problems
in utilizing nuclear energy have been
solved, and that the remaining dii-
ficulties are actually Challenges.
The result will be a Clean, plentiful
source of electrictv for the forseev
able future.

Silver Kills Rome?

in an early morning session Friv
day, Dr. Claire Patterson oftlle Cab
ifornla institute cl Technology andh
Grinnell graduate gave an address
on ”The Accidental LOSS of Silver
in Ancient Times and its Influence
on the Fall of the Roman Empire"

The dual nature of the subject

seemed to satisiy not only the scien-
tists in the audience, but the alt
ending economists as well.

“Bandltry is not the best form of
trade”, Patterson told his audience,
describing the Roman Empire as
a “giant business enterprise"

Due to the difficulties in mllllllg
silver and the sinking of treasure
ships on the high seas, silver pier
ductlon couldn’t offset the silver
shortage, a fact many ancient ec-
onomic historians ignore.

Because of the large silver 1055,

“Our duty is to hold ourselves
responsible to the people. Every
word, every act, and every policy
must conform to the people’s inter-
est, and ii mistakes occur, they must
be corrected —— w—v—
that is what being V‘ ‘
responsible to the
people means."

And with this qu-
otation trom the
“Little Red Ber
ok” of Chairman
Mao TserTung, he
began to explain
how ile planned to
handle the EPC
position.

Kurz says that he is not an edu»
cator, but he stresses the need
ior a free and open education and
ior not idrcing anyone to do any-
thing because of grade coercion.

He plans to spend considerable
time and eilort responding to sine
dent criticism and ideas on educa
tional philosophy, and he hopes to
set up an ad hoc student committee
separate irom SGA to investigate
educational policy. This committee
would work at three levels

Among other things, Kurz sees a
need to examine the present educa-
tional system with possible modifi—
cations and innovations in mind like

Leonard Kurz'

the 471—4 program proposed by
his opponentI Mark Willcher, in the
election.

Currently the educational system
consists oi “phony plastic pack~
ages“ in regards to departmentais,
credits and grades. Kurz envisions
a more free—flowing approach to
education such as that which the
Humanities B-credit course is at-
tempting. As he says, “There is
no need to fit everybody into the
Same educational mold.”

As All—Campus EPC representa-
tive, Kurz feels a responsibility to
the whole campus community and
hopes to keep them informed through
the utilization ofmeetings, and other
informational sources. Kurz also
plans to systematically survey stu-
dent opinion through use ofquestione
naires where both attitudes and re-
action to ideas can be determined.
