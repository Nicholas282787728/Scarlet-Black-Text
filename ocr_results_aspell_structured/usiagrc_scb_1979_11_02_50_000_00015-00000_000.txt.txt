Rugby article praised

To the editor: Rob Sidon's feature
on rugby was the best researched,
most insightful article the 5&5 has
published on the subject But may I
add a postscript or two?

Your readers may have the
mistaken impression that the rugby
club has never received money from
the student body. based on Rob’s
(correct) report that the Initiative
Fund has denied our requests for help.
In fact, SGA has generously given
over $400 to our club in the last two
years. We are grateful for SGA’s sup-
port; without it we would have bad
financial problems and drastically
curtailed schedules.

Claims EPC powers are decreased

To the editor: As a two term member
of the Mathmatics EPC, I am compell~
ed to comment on your article pron
claiming the virtues of the new
guidelines concerning EPC participa
tion in faculty contract decisxons. 9
While the factual account of the prior
system of EPC involvementiwas acs
curate the analysis of its potential
was sadly lacking

Fiist, it is simply not the case that
an EPC s role was necessarily that of
a secretary to the Executive Council,
Interviewmg students for the purpose
of filling out the questionnaire was the
most time consuming part of an
EPC'S evaluation, and a statistical
presentation of the results was en
couraged. However, the interviews
were not limited to the questions found
on the questionnaire; quite a lot of
subiective information ivas passed on
to the EPC member during these face-
tosface interviews. These subjective
impressions could then be included in
an EPC’s recommendations, albeit
separate from the statistical report of
the questionnaire results,

In the article, it was pointed out that
these supplemental reports were ’not
given much consideration by the Ex-
ecutivc Council because they were not
written Clearly. This was the fault of
the EPCs, not the evaluation system.

The new system replaces the face
to-face interviews with a coursesend
computerized questionnaire. The per
sonai interviews are clearly superior.
In addition to providing the EPC with
a feel for what students thought of‘a
professor, the interviewing process
forced the EPC to discuss the pro-

fessor with both majors and non
majors. The opinions‘of non-majors
are very important in service depart-
ments, such as mathematics.

In the past, the end-of»course com-
puterized questionnaire has been very
ambiguous; no student 1 know of has
felt the questionnaires were a suffi-
cient form of input. The computerized
questionnaires don‘t offer the flexibili-
ty of expression found in personal in
terviews. The old rules recognized this
flexibility when they required the
[acestdface interVieW between
students and EPC members, as oppos~
ed to distributing the questionnaires
via the post office to be filled out
privately.

Under the new system, an EPC Will
not be forced to discuss a professor
with a large number of students The
breadth of student input into the con-
tract deClsion-making process will de-
pend on the initiative or the EPC, The
result, I fear, will be “student input”
which disproportionately reflects the
feelings of those few individuals who
happen to be on the EPC. I also fail to
see why one would expect the EPC
reports written under the new system
to be more coherent documents than
the subjective reports produced
before,

It should also be noted that in past
years there has been no inclination on
the part of the faculty to provide
EPCs with the results of the course-
end evaluations, so there is no way for
EPCs to know how classes feel about a
professor, other than comments they
happen to hear, hardly an unbiased
sample,

In summary, 1 see the new rules ,
restricting EPC involvement to
writing a subjective report concerning
the professor s ability as a teacher, in
my opinion, the EPCs of years past
also had this opportunity, but also had
the chance to talk face- to- face with a
fair number of students to gain a‘ good
understanding of the professor’s over-
all performance, These interviews- .
