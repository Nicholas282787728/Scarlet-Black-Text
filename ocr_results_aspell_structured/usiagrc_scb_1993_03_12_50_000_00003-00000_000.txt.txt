LIFEwas good! The worldwas
beautiful. Bill sat in the grass
ieeling on so happy,

Then, out 01 the corner oi
his eye, Bill saw a twinkle. A
sparkle. A shimmer.

Bill turned. And there, was
this purple and orange mushe
room. “My, that's peculiar," Bill
thought.

Bill immediately grabbed
the mushroom and stuck it in
his mouth and swallowed it.
(Bill's tavorite stage ofdevelope
ment was the oral stage. He
never quite got over it.)

Bill sat. He thought, “This is
cool! Free tood growing in the
middle 01 the grass. And it
doesn't make my stomach hurt
like that..."

BAM!

Stars lrom high,
Light the sky.
No one ever wonders why.

Picture this,
A talking lish.
Bill just got another wish.

BILL TRIPS

By Rebeka Meyer

NE day as I walked down the South

campus loggia near James Cottage, I

stopped and noticed a series of initials

embedded in the cemcnt. I hztd always soon them

there but had ncvcr taken the time to really look
at them.

Twelve signatures lay there, immortalimd
in time, bearing the dates 1938 and 1940. The
thought of students my age, over ﬁfty years ago
signing their names to the once wet cement sent
chills up my spine. Someone pointed out to me
Lhcinitials BLM, withthcdate 10/12/38 below it.
The fact that these are my initials excited me (I
informally go by the name Becky, rather then
Rebeka). A friend standing by me as I gazed at
the writing laughed at my childlike cxcitcmcnt.
but I couldn't help feeling some sort of connec-
tion to the letters that lay below me.

That nigbtl went to the archives and pulled
out the 1937 and 1939 yearbooks (unfortunately
the 1938 is not on file). I wcnt to tile index olthc
1939 Cyclone and looked under ‘M'. As my
finger followcd along, I wrote down all of the
people’s namcs who began with B; Belly Mcye,
Blair May, B. Moss, Beatrice Mills. Whowas the
Grinnell college student who shared my initials,
55 years ago? I proceeded to look up their faces.
Although my rcscach skills in deciphering who
this person was were quite primative, I decided

Beatrice Mills was my best
candidotc. ’

In the 1938—39 school ‘
year, Baam‘ce lived inJames
Hall. The photos of her dev
pictedaquiet,propcrwoman.

Of all of lhc names I looked

up, she was the most active

in various campus groups,
includingtheWomcn’sGlcc ,

Club, something called the

Chips Club and a newly ’

formed organization called
lthuillClubTheycarbook
cxplainedthattheChipsclub

wasa social organization for

the children of alumni. The

Quill Club was a group for people interested in
creative writing and “discerning critisism."

I then proceeded to look into the initials
printed abovc hcrs, which seemed to bc written
in the some writing. I looked up all of the people
with the initials BB and searched for connec-
tions. One man, Browne Barr from Rawson Hall
wa o in the Quill Club as well as several other
activities. Could he have been a friend vismng
that evening? Perhaps Lhc signature was Bonard
Baily, a man who was also in the Gloc club. Or
possibly it was Bellc Booth, a small woman with
the same fricndly glow that Beatrice displayed.

The odds of Beatrice being the actual one
who signed hcr initials in the cement one

Names from Grmnell’s Past

stilt mm

Novemeber evening in 1938 are quite low.
Whether Beatrice and I would have had much in
common aside from our initials, I'll probablly
never know. But bringing the experience In life
gave me a connection to the past and the people
who occupied this campus many years ago.
Looking through yearbooks of years gone
by, we see faces and names similar to our own.
Although the times and styles have changed, we
all walked the same ground, lived in the same
dorm rooms and experienced college life as
Grinnell students. The initials etched in the car
merit temporarily bring the past to life, reminde
ing us that the four years we spend here are only
a brief breath in the contiuing life of this school.
