OPINION

Murder in town reminds

us of campus isolation

I was sitting in the Forum reading this
week’s campus memo when a friend ap-
proached and without hesitation ushered
me to the list ofcanipiisseeiirity incidents.
With a smitk, he pointed to one of the
entries. it read “found paint thinner, black
her at knife." Grouped with the campus
security issues ofunlocked omce doors, lost
“but later recovered" keys, can'dle-induccd
trash can fires and, on a much more seri-
ous level, “harassing 5t sexual” messages,
the report was strikingly peculiar,

In the world outside Grinnell, paint
thinner in ii crime report might conjure
images ofmndalism or arson. A black hat
and a knife might bring to mind stocking.
capped hold up men, general thugs orbut-
glars. vet. because we are at crinnell Col-
lege and the items were in all likelihood
left behind by n Facilities Management
painter, the quirky report is laughable. We
are afforded the luxury oflaughing because
crinnell College Exists as a sortofsecluded
haven, separate from the relatively violent
outside world. Mast Lavcrn Park was mur-
dered justblocks from campus and we re-
maincd isolated and insulated, it appears
that nftet a night ofdrinking in town,
Lavern, 23, Archie Robert Bear, 30, and a

group of acquaintances began the trek
home just as numerous Grinnell students
do every weekend. As the group reached
5th Street between Bread and Park St., an
argument erupted between Park and Bear.
Best pulled a knife and brutally slit Lavern's
throat because, in his own words. “Max . .
was going to beat me up." in the lives of
Bear and Lavern, knives and black hats are
far from comic.

As word of the slaying reached cam»
pus, we were shocked and expressed com-
passionate regret. Common reactions were
“oh my God, I walked right by there" or
“why did he do it; did they know each
other?" Soon, however. we learned that
bath men were unconnecred to Grinnell,
both the town and the college. We learned
that both men had been drinking and that
the murder resulted from an argument. A
short time later the killing was no longet
news. A murder on our doorstep did not
seem to warrant alarm. Such isolation of-
ten the cause of complaint is a blessing few
are able to enjoy. Grinnell college students
are lucky enough to have four years they
can devote almost exclusively to bettering
themselves. On a daily basis we choose to
study, to donate time to public service, to
participate in the arts or to have a carefree
beer with a friend. Our daily lives are free
from all of the imminent life-threatening
surprises whidi face the moths and Bears
of the outside world. We relish our time
here and lament the reality of the world
beyond Gtinncll. And we should.

However, no matter how isolated we
are, we are not exceptional. The memo:
report ofu “harassing or sexual message left
on white board,” rape, racial slurs and sui-
cide each, in their own way, remind us that,
though we have extraordinary opportuni»
ties, we differ from Archie Beat more in
degree than in kind; that our isolation is
not superiority; and that we still must
struggle morally every day.

 

 

 

Grinnell campus,

We are running for SGA President and
vp/mn, despite the fact not we are so.
niors, graduating, not eligible, and nor
actually'intcrested in the jobs.

so why run, and WHY SHOULD
you VOTE FOR US?

This is not a joke campaign (although
it is a campaign full of jokes). The com
paign is the best way to focus attention on
the issue ofreal rciorm. Real reform can.
not come from within the current system,
which is stagnant and bureacratic. Real
reform must come from outside ofthc sys.
tem, lfyou are frustrated with SGA and
wish to see real change, not voting isn’t
enough, and voting for an actual candi-
date isworse. voting rotacundidatc sends
the message that SGA is mostly okay, not
voting sends me message that you don’t
care. voting rot us, or otherwise actively
throwing away your vote, sends the mes.
sage that the whole or SGA must he
changed!

How can real reform be accomplished?
Ed suggests a constitutional convention to
reorganize SGA from the ground up, with
no reliance on previous structures. There
are of course alternatives, including be.
nevolent monarchy or removal of execu.
rive branch of government. All we really
ask is that you think about the alternatives
for yourself.

is representative Democracy the best
system for crinnell, or is it a holdover
from more conservative past, merely
based on the federal system?

Why are budgetary bodies such’as
ACE, Concerts, Finance, and Films con-
nected through SGA to purely policy based
agencies such as the President, VP/PAA,
Joint Board, and the various cancerous
committees of scrv Would it be more
effective to seperate the tasks?

isn’t it time to think critically about
SGA and make some real reforms?

Dear Editor,

As most ofyou know, SGA President
and Vicerresident elections are coming up
next Wednesday (March 3rd). lwould like
to challenge the campus community to
show that self.governence is alive and well
by having the largest turnout in recent
memory This is not a hard activity The
ballot box will be in the post ofﬁce all day
and outside the dining halls at dinner.
Voting will take, at most, ten minutes or
your time. So, come out and show that
you actually care about who governs this
campus and vote on March 3rd.

Dear Editor,

i would never have guessed that this
school would have something as ridiculous
as a athlete appreciation day. i understand
that it may have been in jest, so i won't
think whoever thought the whole thing up
is completely out of touch. instead, I'd
like to nominate a few others for my own
appreciation days.

1. Carrie Brownell, Women’s Soccer.
I saw her elbow awoman from st. Norbert
in the head as their legs were getting tied
up. The woman actually cried. She gets
the “Fun to Watch" award this year.

2. Troy Dougherty, Football. Talk
about records. The best part was the coach
actually wanted him to give the ball to
other people on the team, and when he
did that the team won.

3. Aaron stockham, Baseball. With a
break like that one 1 was surprised to see
him walking as soon as he was. Now he is
back on the team and may make it onto
the field by his senior year. Comeback
player ofthe year.

So, remember that there are more nth.
lercs that contribute to this school than
just jcff clement. Especially rot those of
us who like watching teams play,

Dear Editor,

in response to Lyle Bauman's letter last
week reflecting the shortage ofstudcnt la-
hot in the dining halls, l have merely to
offer one suggestion: an analysis of the
basic economics at work here. Despite the
wishes ofmany Grinnellians, we still live
in a largely capitalist system where work is
governed by the laws of supply and de.
mand. it is simply not in the

interests ofenough Grinnellians to give
up an hour of their time for a paltry ﬁve
dollars and thirty cents. Rather than com-
plain about not having enough employ.
ees, the obvious course is one which our
trustees have finally taken: rasing student
wage rates across the board. lfservice re.
mains subpar after these rate hikes take
effect, the result will be less students on
l4, l7, and 21 meal board plans. Thus,
fewer employees will be needed and the
system will have worked itselfout.

As Deepthroat said, “Follow the
money." Despite Wllal some Grinnellians
may say about doing dist, they nonethe—
less do.

Dear Editor,

in the flurry ofsterements by the can-
didates tor the upcoming son elections, i
feel an issue has been overlooked. last 5e—
mester as an SGA senator, one issue was
meantioned which i think has the paren—
rial to be of great importance to the
Grinncll community. The issue is space. As
many people have observed, both
crinnelrs popularity and enrolment have
been rising. more space rot student hous-
ing is needed, and i believe i have the so.
lution. i feel the adding ofa third wing to
Younkcr Hall would he aesthetically pleas-
ing, practical in scope and convenient to
the entire campus. vounker already has two
wings and adding a vounket East would
only be a natural outgrowth ofits current
binary structure. Attached at the centeral

The ways in which the youth ofa generation find enjoyment and entertain ment changes

c'ollege, have a duty: to shake shake shake your
booties And on the evening of Saturday,
March 13, this obliga- tion must be fulfilled.
Disco is neverariything resembling ordinary,
and this one promises to be more extraordi-
nary than ever. Disco x, the final Disco ofrhc
decade, of the century and of the millenium,
will be nothing but the ﬁnest in pure funk and

stairway, Younkcr East would provide more
rooms while at the same time maintaining
access to one ofthe better equipped halls e
- a computer lab, the main lounge (fre-
quently the site of concerts), and a soda/
candy machine are all just feet from this
stairway. By removing a few trees, this
extention could reduce the pressure on
other dorms as well as utilizing a currently
wasted space. Objections might be made
that this space is currendy used by students
, to study, play frisbec or engage in other
activities. Mac ﬁeld, however, is adajccnt
to Younker on the other side, as well as the
open (cutivated and flowered) space to the
immediate west onounker and south of
Spainish House. The benefits ofa Younker
extenrion would, I believe, outweigh these
minor dianges in die status quo. This wing,
extending towards Darby, could even cap
its end with balcony style windows that
would both echo the architecture ofGates
Tower (the most often pictured/promoted
site on campus) as well being the site of
more suites (an explicit goal ofthe campus
master committee). The centrality of
