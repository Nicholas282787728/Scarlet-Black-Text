TILE CYCLONE

in discussing the Cyclone, another
question, besides that at its ionn oi
organization, arises. Why does the
Cyclone feature juniors?

12 there is any reasonable excuse
tor devoting a halt page each to the
members or a particular class, it must
be to give individual accounts of their
college career. But why is this done
at a time when they have been in col-

“What’s the use of it?"

Michael Faraday saw the real beginning
of the age of electricity nearly a century
ago when he thrust a bar magnet into a
coil of wire connected with a galvanometer
and made the needle swing. A

Gladstone, watching Faraday at work in
his laboratory, asked, “What’s the use of
it?” The experimenter jestlngly replied,
"There is every probability that you will
soon be able to taxi .” The world—wide use
of electricity that has followed the Faraday
discovery abundantly justiﬁes the retort
to Gladstone.

Faraday’s theory of lines of force is con-
stantly applied in the Research Laboratories
of the General Electric Company in de-
vising new electrical apparatus of which
Faraday never dreamed. Every generator
and motor is an elaboration of the simple
instruments with which he ﬁrst discovered
and explained induction."
