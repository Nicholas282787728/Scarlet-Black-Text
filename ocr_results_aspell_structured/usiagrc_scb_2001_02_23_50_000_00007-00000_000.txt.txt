the inmband crowd and they were our in full force.

What they heard was probably not what they
were expectingit set of mellow, acoustic music
Quite a few members of the crowd seemed restless
during the show and listless afterwards, Scofield’s laid
back musings threw a curveboll to those less familiar
with his work. To be perfectly honest, outside ofn
few cursory listens to his other work, A Gr Gr was
the album that piqued my interest in scoficld as well.

while Wortrfoer might be

The groove might be more subdued, but it is just as
infectious From McBridc's opening bnss rifron “I’ll

Vagina Monologues

Pieces filled with 'emotion and celebration’

by Amanda Davis
Staff Writer

Going into the vagina monologues, I expected more. More
pain, more trauma, morcselhioathing, more ofail the negative emoe
trons that I've Come to expect women to feel, particulnrly regarding
sex and their bodies. Honestly, I expected to be depressed. I ndrnit
I wasn't familiar with the monologues themselves, or with Eve Enslcr’s
purpose in writing them.

Thus, I had the pleanurc of
being surprised by what I
saw: 1n hour and a halfthat
was mostly ﬁlled with iinnshnnied sensation and emotion and cele
ebration

Jenni Headlcy officially outdid Meg Ryan in her role as “The
womnn Who Loved to mnkeVoginns Hoppy.” Laurelin Muir mixed
n Joy—sey accent with an old woman and a flood and created some-
thing great. Tire word “cunt" became poetry in the hands and mouth
of SummerVenlis. Liz Burmcster made us realize that imginss at:
the true porhs to selirdiscovery. Kesvyn Asuka reminded us that out
cntrnnces into this world are truly miraculous and holy. For awhile,
thnt “anatomicnl vacuum randomly sucking up atoms from the sur-
rounding environment” was allowed to be demystified and even up
precinteri,

Naturnlly, there was some or that pain that l’d been anticipat-
ing, and the Monologues cast portrayed it very vividly. Kalli Van
Wavcren performed the most sobering monologue ofthe night, a
testimonial ofa victim ofsexull abuse, Yet. even in such a painful
nccount, there wns n good deal or beauty As vnn Woveren wrote in
her contribution to the company statements, hcr charactcrwos “able
to express her pnin witli poignancy and strength, and to ﬁnd resolve
with both the beautiful memories oflove, sex, and our bodies, m
well as the horrible memories."

The strength of the characters came through courtesy of the
strength ofthe actors. In the moments of porn, nostalgia, joy, and,
yes, ecstasy I felt the presence ofthewomcn who inspired Eve Ensler,
In the small space ofThc Wall, the cast was able to share the stories
ofnli those lives, and many ofus in the audience couldn’t help but
appreciate their candor.

Even Within the notorious Grinnell bubble, I haven't managed
to escnpe the influences ofthe larger society Specifically, I have not
failed to notice the deluge of imagcs ofwomcn whose Sexuarlil’y is
deﬁned by thcworld and people around them. It was wonderiul to
spend an evening with these talented Grinnell women, whose vitale
iry and passion wasn’t constrained by any image or expectation,
