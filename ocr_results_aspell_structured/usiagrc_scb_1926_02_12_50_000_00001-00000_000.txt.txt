(13y Prof. Paul s. \l'ood)
“Ships and shoes and scaliris-wa
and cahbages and kings.” The Exp
imental theatre program in A, R, H.
auditorium last night ilicllrded the
whole range and demonstrated the
versat ty oi Iowa playwrights and
actor-s. The plays varied iroin brood
farce oi "Zringing up Father” type to
dramatic portrayal of Life's lost grim
jest with Kit Marlowe. Ships and
shoes were introduced and while
there was no sealing y, there were

"Cabbages" and “Kicksllaws.” 'Every‘

one in the audience must have found
something to his taste.

“Cabbages” was El. riot from curtain
to curtain. Ted Peterson as Gus
Gi-ossmeier. the newly rich Iowan,
and Miss Mar-y Matlaclr as his wire,
“’ilhelminzt—trying to live up to all
four syllables, presented excellent
character parts. Miss Dorothy DC-
‘Vitt as Mrs, Lelia Fischer had the
house with her [rom lier entrance.

She succeeded in that most unusual'

oi amateur accomplishincnts,_ a con—
vincing stage laugh. Miss Mariorie
Williams, Miss Pauline Crook, Joseph
McKee, and Elton Follett completed a
good cast. The plav a product oi the
Northwestern Unive ity Playshop,
treated amusingly the old truth that
good, honest cahhages are not to be
made over night into hot»housc roses.
It made the point.
“Kickslntlts” Proves Difficult

Kickshnws, Miss Roma Kanifman's
adaptation of James Branch Cabelrs
short story. “Porcelian Cups, was a
less successiul production or a far
more diliicult play. Miss Wave Rich-
ards, in spite or a very short period
of preparation, gave a charming por-
trayal of a trying part, that oi Mis—
tress Cynthia Allonhy, the pretty but
shallow—smiled Elizabethan maid.
Her three lovers were represented by
Clarence Jacubsen as Ned Mnsgrave,
the country gentlemen, Donald Laird
as Lord Fevensey, the diplomat and
conrtier, and Hawthorne Arey as
Christopher Marlowe, the poet. The
last had an exacting port which he
carried with spirit.

Although the plot and a good deal
or the dialogue oi “Kickshaws” was
taken over directly, the play is no
slavish reproduction or the original.
Miss Karriiman rearranged her may

morning prolossor He -iott, whom
Dean ‘ollell introduced as “one oi

in which iield he has done much ori—
ginal research.

“Tile selection or Washington was
consummated in silence and without
debate. The action was taken behind
closed doors; the pcople were dclills
eratcly shut out in order to assure
tlic. public weliare. Per contra, the
nomination oi Lincoln took place amid
a bcdlam oi noise and the surging oi
crowds screaming their demands.”
Many historians have maintained that
Lincoln was the choice or the conren-
tion which met in the Wigwam at
Chicago, by rcason oi miserable ma-
chinations against Seward and by rea—
son of mob pressure. Quoting Lord
Charllwood, an emInCnt English auth—

, “This was the most surprising
nomination in American history and
was not the i lt oi merit."

in seeking to disprove these allegv
ntions, Protessor Her-riott stated cer—
tain primary precautions which must
be taken, in order to guard against
error: irrst, in politics, as in science,
popular notions are usually super-ric—
ial, and tor the most part are likely

Another contmlling iorcc in the
Chicago convention was the power oi
the German vote throughout the corin-
try. Had it not been for the relents
less opposition oi that group, Dr.
Hen'lott believes that Judge Bates, oi
St, Louis, who was supported by
Horace Greely and the New York
Tribune, would have been the nom—
inee. About that time, however, the
so-callcd "no-nothing" agitation
brought into the ior-egroirnd a pro—
posal to llniit naturalization to those
who had lived twentyvone years in
the country. The Massachusetts Gen-
eral Court attempted to pa . such an
amendment to its state constitution,
which aroused such a storm oi opposs
iticn among the ior-eign-born that thc
republican central commiltccs in
many states hastened to dcnoimce the

Commencing his program with a
group which included compositions
by Bach, Glnclr and Beethoven the
visiting artist reached the high point
oi his excellence in the Apposionata

which he read with emphasis on its
dramatic qualities, and executed with
violent contrasts. in the Beethoven
composition Levitzlti displayed a
wealth oi technieanower, a clear cut
