WORTH FOLLOWING

Tom Burroughs, art editor of College Humor
and a former Grinncllian, rcccntly lauded The
Scarlet and Black as one of the worthwhile organi-
zations of thc Grinnell college campus. In making
such a statement he was judging from the IICWSr
paper he knew when he was here and probably as
sumcd that each new management was as capable
as that preceding. Sometimes that’s a large order
to ﬁll. ,

The Scarlet and Black editorials of the last
year have been particularly successful in that they
carried weight on the campus, attracted interest
from other colleges, and still managed to avoid the
taint: of scnsaiioualism. Credit for thc tact with
which editorial topics were chosen and the ﬁnesse
in Writing must go to both the editor and the edi-
torial board.

Underclass members of the‘ editorial board
agreed at a meeting held last night. to continue with
two of the topics advocated by The Scarlet and
[Black during the lost year, namely, a proposal for
tlle use of the library stacks by students, and the
suggestion that students be entitled to help choose
speakers for the college lecture course. Other topics
which were discussed at the meeting included the
proposal to establish a central auditing system, a
revision of the present cut system, and thc limita-
tion of activities according to the number of grade
points credited to the student at the close of the
previous semester. These matters will probably be
taken up editorially during the year.

Changes ill the student newspaper during the
next year will be few. An effort will he made to
establish a flexible editorial column, using reprint
editorials when the subjects are pertinent on the
Grinncll campus and when ample space is available.
When advertising runs high it is logical that this
material should he the ﬁrst to be left out. Modern
journalism decrees that the best place for a humor
column is the editorial pug Ill View of this. Doric
may be shifted to that [)0 on laLcr in the yea]

The advance stories on out»ofetcwli athletic
teams, wire, coverage on contests, and the Lill-
balanced front pagc makeup introduced last year
will all be continued as outstanding changes in
The Scarlet and Black. Pictures, while they liven
the paper, will not be allowed to force important
news out of the columns. They are a desirable fca-
turc when it is possible to usc them, however.

The lilanagcmcnt of the newspaper neceivcs
complaints regularly from one department or one
other regarding the space givcn to certain events.
Every cditor endeavors to llccp these as well bal-
anccd as possible, featuring stories whit-h he he»
lievcs of the most interest to Grimlcll students.
Cooperation with staff, mombcl‘s ill their efforts
to procure stol'iL ill probably the best method to
insure adequate coverage.

The Scarlet and Black is after all more of ii
laboratory than a {ini lcd product. Many staff
members are comparative newcomer in thc journ-
alistic world and the editor, bu. uc manager, and
department heads are not yet cxpclts ill thcil ﬁeld.

SMOKING AGAIN

Gl'inllcll tradition was strengthened last spring
when the Honor G club and Lantern called att 'llr
tion to the smoking on the campus. Tobacco ur
moved across the street for their betwccurclass
se ions and throughout the yi-ar have ob red the
more faithfully,

Thcrc has bccu a continued movc bacl tow rd
the college buildings, however. Thc topi was
again discussed at a recent Lantern nit-cling and
it was brought out that the sumo men who hail
previously gathered across the street are now gath-
ering at the campus border, That in itself is well
enough, but it shows a tendency which will, unless
halted, end with gatllcringseztt the doorways to
the Alumni Recitation hall similar to those seen
last year.

UNIFORM COLLEGE CURRICULUMS

Another hl-oadsidc was ﬁred at high school
and college education by Prof. Thomas II, Briggs
of Columbia university lit, tllc l‘cceut Chicago coll-
\'olitiou of the North (‘clliral Ila ”Kilian. He (10»
uouuccd the education in the United States as a
“costly failure,” because obsolete and unfruitful
courses hold such a large place in c 'iculums.

Molly college students are inclined to agreo
with Professor Briggs that part of their studios
are little mort- than a wastr of time even while ill
school. and that a larger proportion are of no
practical use in the war 1 outside of academic halls.

Therefore, Mr. Briggs’ recommendation that
a national commission of pickcd educators be up
pointcd to pu c school catalogs of unnccc sary
studies comes as a new suggestion worth CDIlSldQY~
mg.

To be sure, reorganization on such a vast scale
would be so expensive and so revolutionary that
there is small danger of its bring put into effect
soon. But the suggestion is at lcast a step in the
direction of national uniformity of courses of
study. And it is encouraging in that it recognizes
the need for immediate action ill thc lnattcl'.

Certainly college curriculums do need reno-
vating, and the sooner educators start it wisely,
the better. Though Professor Briggs’ propo l is
in some ways impractical, the fact of its being is
Valuable as an all t clicss of the need for revision.

A LEADER IN EDUCATION
(From the Des Moines Register)

President John Hanson Thomas Main of Grinnell
college, who died on the eve of his seventy-second birth-
day, must be ranked high among the educational leaders
of Iowa, President Main loved Grihnell and devoted his
whole energy to its Welfare. He took the lead in making
Grinnell one of the outstanding colleges not only of Iowa
but of the middlewest.

Under his direction, the college made Valuable addi-
tions to its building equipment, including dormitory
groups for men and women Studentsibuildings which
have been studied to advantage by other colleges. He
also increased the college endowment and brought to
the campus a well chosen and able group of educators,

President Main refused to allow athletics to over-
balance the educational aims of the college, and refused
to compromise with educational lads. He ever looked
forward, however, and was among the earlier advocates
of many educational ideas which experience has since
proved valuable. His outlook was always youthful,

It is unfortunate that in his last years President
Main was harassed by the work and worry of a money-
raising campaign which has dragged on since 1921, and
which was complicated by the farm deﬂation of a decade
ago and the recent business depression. Yet. he threw
all his energy into this difﬁcult work because he wanted
Grinnell to be a still more potent force in higher e‘dur
cation in the middlewest.

President Main will be missed. Missed by students
who know that he had their best interests at. heart, by
teachers whom he helped and inspired. by tcvmspeople
with whom he always had cordial relations, and by a
host of graduates and former students—some of whom
may not now accept the idealism of his chapel talks,
but all of Whom will remember him as a spirited leader
and a wise counselor. The trustees of the college will
have difﬁculty in ﬁlling his place with a man of similar
stature.

ANOTHEQCOLLEGE LEADER DIES
(From the Daily Iowan)

Nearly 25 years of service in Iowa education were
terminated Wednesday by the death of President J,H.T.
Main of Grinnell college.

His proleges as teacher of Greek, or as college presi~
dent, made no dashing end runs or cutbacks like the
pupils of Knute Rockne, whose death the day before
grieved the nation's sports fans. They did, however, durr
ing the last quarter century steadily contribute to the
reputation of Grinnell college as a midwest center of
culture, one of few in the nation.

Grinnell college is one of six institutions sharing
Harvard exchange professorships, One other in the mid-
dlewest is Knox college, which is to Illinois what Grinnell
is to Iowaiepitol'ne of the best that a small college can
offer in culture, antithesis of all that mass education
means in stress on quantity rather than quality,

Grinnell college is exclusive in the sense that its
entrance standards and its scholarship qualiﬁcations
make it so. That exclusiveness is well worth having.
Average students are welcome at Grinnell, are offered
splendid facilities. Inferior students, or those unwilling
to work, do not slide through Grinnell so easily as at
marry other schools.

It is not hard to ascertain why such a college should
have its credits accepted at face value on transfer to
the University of Iowa. it is not difﬁcult to see how the
reputation of such an institution should attract to its
student body representatives of distant points, as well
as much of the cream from Iowa’s high school grad-
uates. ,

How much of what the college is can be traced to
its administrator is prohiematieal, but certainly during
his 25 years of executive guidance over the destinies of
Grinneil President Main was responsible for achieve-
ments which merited his selection for the camegie
foundation's board of trustees.

No one can wish to take one iota of credit from
Knute Rockne as a national ﬁgurc in athletics, But just
as surely as high ideals in sportsmanship are deserving
of acclaim, in like measure lofty ideals of scholarship
and culture mcrit their portion of respect.

The passing of this individual educator doubtless
marks a milestone for Grinnell college, which will he
fortunate to replace him‘ with a worthy successor, which
will be blessed if there are enough that cherish the
same ideals to carry on in the memory of his efforts
toward ﬁner education.
