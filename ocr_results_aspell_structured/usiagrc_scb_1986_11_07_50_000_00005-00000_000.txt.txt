GIL Students Travel to Ireland for Fall Break

by shelley Reid

The nicest thing about group iield trips
with Grinnellrlanonddli is that someone
else does all the planning. This is not true
at Fall Break, We suddenly found
ourselves in one oi Europe's gateway
cities with ten completely Iree days, and
nobody to tell us what to do. For someone
whose major contributions to previous
Fall break expeditions has been to sit in
the back seat and ask "Are we there yet?”
planning an entire holiday was a true
Learning Experience A Iriend and I (inal-
ly deCided on a whirlwind tour of the
British Isles: three days in southern
Ireland. three days traveling. and five
days in northern Scotland.

Since that adds up to eleven days oi our
tenrday holiday, we decided to do the Iirst
leg oi the trip on Thursday night.
(GrinnelleineLondon does not hold class on
Fridays.) This meant taking a train irom
London at 10:15 pm. catching a terry in
Wales at 3:15 a m,, and arriving in Ireland
at7:003,m We were not aware that the ens
tire trip is set up speciiically to keep
passengers irom getting any measurable
amount of sleep.

At 11:30. all passengers going to Ireland
got out oi the iirst train. walked across a
long platlorm. and got into another train.
Every twenty minutes we were loudly in»
iormed that this was indeed the right train
ior passengers catching the Sealink to
Ireland, ‘

At about 1:00 am. We arrived in
Fishguard. on the Welsh Coast We were
expected to wander aimlessly about the
platiorm ior ninety minutes betore being
allowed to board the ferry, Finally we got
into the Sealink ship. sat down. and began
to doze oIl.

On Cue. all children on board under the
age oi iive woke up and began either to cry
hysterically or to have a jolly good time.
At 3:30 am. there is simply no way to
sleep through a rambunctious game of
hide and shriek, so we gave up.

Getting to Ireland is only hall the battl
getting around in Ireland is an entirely d
{erent matter, Busses are infrequent, exe
pensive, and a_bit tricky.

For instance. the bus labeled COR»
KiKILKENNY did not go to Kilkenny.
First. we went to Cahir and changed to

another bus labeled CAHIRmKILKENNY,
This one only went as tar as Clonmel. We
boarded yet. another bus in Clonmel, one
labeled DUBLIN. that finally dropped us
in Kilkenny

The LET'S GO guide repeat dly advises
travelers to try hitchhiking litchhiking

anywhere you want to go " We consulted
the natives. got a good spot and a destinar
tion sign. stuck out our thumbs. and
waited.

Others indicated that on any other day
they would gladly have given us a ride. but
on this particular Friday they just had
other things to do We stuck our hands into
our pockets and dejectedly walked back to
the bus station. Why couldn't we have been
in the 99% of the hitchhikers who do get
ridesV

Alter the Seallnk nightmare and the hit»
ching iiasco, we spent the night at the Cork
Youth Hostel, not bad as youth hostels go.
However, due to the fact that the map in
the hostel guidebook was not drawn to

turned out to be the final disaster of the
day: a two-mile walk. in the dead or night,

On our last night, we got into Sun

and stopped at a hotel.

No doubt the proprietor was amused to
watch us searching our pockets ior our last
pieces oi Irish money to pay ior a rather
expensive room, Reduced to thirty-lour
pence between us. we were not so amused
to discover that the place didn't have a
shower or even real toilet paper (only the

In between our adventures, we had some
good Irish fun. We went to Blarney Castle
and bent over backwards to kiss the
iamous Blarney Stone (contracting who
knows how many nasty diseases).
