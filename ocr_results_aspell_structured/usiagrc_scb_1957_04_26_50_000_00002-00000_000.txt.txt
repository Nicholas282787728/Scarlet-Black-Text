Liberal Liberal Arts

Grinnenll is in theory committed to the philosophy that
a good education must be one that is broadly based. The face
ulty acts as the primary perpetuator of this liberal arts
philosophy when they incorporate it into the curriculum
and graduuation requirements,

’ However, in matters which are not strictly academic,
faculty members seem unwilling to cooperate among them-
selves and with the administration toward allowing students
to have the broad education which is available.

For example, some professors, even in the division
which planned the activity, held classes during the Writers’
conference, and others objected strongly to their students‘
attending. To a certain extent, attendance at Good Friday
services was discouraged in this way, and the same attitude
prevails concerning tomorrow morning's Institute of Inter-
national Affairs program. If there are complaints about
poor attendance, this may be a big reason.

Admittedly, there are problems. Students should not be
able to get out of work because of feigned interests, and no
specific class periods should have to carry the burden for
most of the out-of—class meetings

We feel that the best aid in overcoming these prob-
lems, and consequently encouraging a broadened student
outlook, would be an attitude of cooperation among faculty

To the Editor:

The members of Langan Hall
of the year 1956-57,

commons that the pursuit
of a balanced liberal arts edu-
cation is highly pendent on the
cnvirorncntol conditions oi the
respective halls, namely in re
gard to the facilities available
for the maintenance of the
membership;

REAPFTRMING our devotion
to the ideals of the Liberal arts;

BELIEVENG, that for the fur
ther realization of these ideals
and in the interests of the pres
ent members as well as the fu-

aggrovotcd to an intolerable ex-
tent by over-populating certain
rooms and areas, namely the
annex and suites;

CONSIDERING that such on:
favorable situations will have
repercussions in the academic
and social iiic oi the various
individuals, and in due regard
to the monetary investments of
those involved;

HAVE in consequence decided
to go ‘Qn record to show our
common discontent in the ads
ministration‘s present movement
to increase the enrollment and
burden the living conditions in

somewhere near the top.

I suppose you know what's
coming: having just read a good
I) o o k, h e a r c
some good mu-
sic, and can»
quered a spl'in
cold, I‘m in a
mood to waxF
e l o q u e n t on;
what kind of 2V
place this is. I

We have a»'
way of “talking
down” the col~ ,
lege we go to, at least w ile we
are in attendance here—how
often have you heard Grinnell
referred to as the worst of all
possible worlds by someone who
had just found a hair in their
dessert, an eyelash in their
milk, or a leaky faucet in their
john?

It‘s true that Grinnell's sllc-
ems doesn’t seem to ﬁt
when we consider our leaky
pipes, our lack of facilities,
and the abortive attempts at
bldgs. and gmds. But we still
have one or the best physical
setups in the conference (it
l’m not mistaken, second only
to Carleton) and improve-
ments are rapidly and hope-
lully being made.

Over and above the imper-
rect physical lworld that we live

ition and redecoration in the

reputation and are rece ving in-
creasing public recognition,

We all want to preserve this reputationnlt is essential that
our standards of quality go up, not down, This includes standard
of living in the residence halls,

a rank growth of enrollment all in one year could tempor—
arily, it not permanently, injure our standards both in housing
and instruction. We do not plan to allow such growth to takc
place, instead, it will be our policy in 1957-53 and thereafter
to wntrol growth to increments wc can properly handle.

In our best judgment, Grinnell’s residence hall capacity in.
cluding several spaces not now occupied by students, is somewhere
between 920 and 950, A capacity in this range can be achieved
without net reduction of present standards.

Whilc I am not certain of our accuracy, we are now predict.
ing fall enrollment will be 920 to 940 blending married students
and others who will not live in the residence halls, in short, i
do not foresee a crowded condition about which students need to
be alarmed,

Moreover, we are planning a substantial program of renova-

hnlls this summer which should en<
hence their attractiveness both to new and returning students.

During the year 1951-53 Grime“ will dell-utcly move into
in an requiring capacity control on enrollment in addition to
the nor-ml controls set by our admission requirements :rlic
likelihood is that we shall bc,turning away large numbcis or
well-quiliﬂod students {or whom we will not luvs mm. A:
funds tor additional iaculty and buildings permit, we shall
probably iouow an orderly program of growth up to about
1,100 students The limit may not be achieved for several yms.

However, inasmuch as we are committed to a policy of limit.
ed size, the years ahead promise as never before the opportun-
ity for still higher standards of quality. You may be assured the
Board of Trustees, the faculty, and the administration will not
allow Grinnelrs standards to be diluted.

i hope there will be several opportunities yet this spring to
exchange views on these matters because i am anxious to share
with students the future plans and prospects of the college
