Harley Writes
Note of Thanks

To Crinnelliarls

There aren’t many students
who have attended Gl'innell
Since the turn of the century
who won’t remember Harley,
the taxi and transfer man
who has wrestled with suit—
cases and trunks for days
before and after each vaca-
tion.

AL the present time Harley T.
Harrington is a patient in the
Veterans Hospital in Des Moines,
but his thoughts are still with
his friends in Crinnell.

In a letter addressed to Miss
Evelyn Gardner's office May 22,
Harley writes:

“While 1 was in the hospital
in Grinnell 1 received a lot
of cards and flowers from the
girls in Homes, and also from
Smith hali; also rrorii some

other of the cottages: Cleve-

land, James, and Read.

“Would you please read this let-
ter in the dining room of an eve»
ning, or in a logical place where
there will be a gathering, so you
may express my thanks to these
girls who sent me these flowers
.and cards. 1 would appreciate this
very much.
