From the ﬁrst play it tvas evi-
dent that Cornell would not gain
much ground through the Grin-
nell line. Cornell won the toss
and chose the north goal with the
wind slightly in their favor. They
failed to make their ﬁrst ﬁve yards
and puntecl to Van Lietv. From
this time on Grinnell made Cons
sistent gains until at the end of
six minutes play the ball

DR. STEINER.

Finishes Hls Series or Addresses by De»
livering a Poweriul Sermon on
Tolstoi.

Sunday Dr. Steiner gave an
instructivetalk before the men's
Bible classcs. At the Vesper
servree he spoke on the ease with
which one tnay understand the
Christian religion. In the even
ing Dr. Steiner preached at the
CongregationalChliichonTolsloi:
The man and His Message.
Brought face to face with the
wretchediiess and surterino oi the
lower classes of Russia, Tolstoi
gave up his excellent prospects
tor literary and political tame and
devoted his tile to giving help to
the peasants and to favoring plans
ltor improving their conditions.
Finally he gave up his tormcr
life completely and became one oi
the peasants. He gave away his
property and adopted the dress
and did the work of a Russian
larnrer, becoming atypical peas
an: in every way, living their lite
and Sharing their sorrows.

13y his example and by his
ponerlul pen Toisto. has (lone
wonders toward the uplifting at
his peasant lrtends.

And although Tolstui apparcnlr
ly gave up a ltlc oi lame and honor,
he lids gained by his work limiting
the poor oi Russia, a higher and
ntibler place than any other man
the mighty Russian empire.
Hts lite isa living example prov-
ing that the kingdom of Heaven
is lound and is lived in human
hearts.

Tolstoi hasa message lor the
Slav and the world and has done

more than any other to teach his
people the wickedness of war,
the wrong of extreme accumula-
tions oftvealth and atruer respect
for womanhood.

Dr. Steiner is full of earnest
