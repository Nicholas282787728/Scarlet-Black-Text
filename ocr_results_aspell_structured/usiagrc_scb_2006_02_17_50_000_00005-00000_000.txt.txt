have seniors attend to the performance,
said, “You'll still have enough time to
go to 100 Days after.”

They aer out a simple plor. Mescon

The Ritalin Test Squad prepares for its
24-hour fundraiser for DVA/SAC

EV Kwou YANG

Tonight, 11 students will fill their bodies with stimulants
and let loose not for a good time,but for a good cause.

The Ritalin Test Squad will host the ﬁrst 24ehour improv
marathon in campus history to raise awareness for domestic
violence and sexual assaultr Members have sold mﬁle tickets
outside dining halls for the evenr. scheduled to begin at 10 pm,
in Gardner Lounge, it will end the next day in Main Lounge.
All of the proceeds are going to the Domestic Violence Alter-
natives/ Sexual Assault Center, Inc (DVA/SAC).

The Ritalin Test squad ﬁrst got the idea to hold a marathon
from a new member, Andy MacDonald, French, who had done
improv marathons as ﬁrndraisers before. The group will prob
ably play more “longeform’l games, which are usually around 15
to 40 minutes. The group has a list of30 or 40 games, some of
which they haven't played in a year.

“From what I understand, nobody has done this ever before
on campus,” said Paul Wainright ’07. "We are going to have a
lot ofcoffee and a lot ofRed Bull. It’s kind ofimportant that we
are in that same place for the long haul because we kind or need
to bunker down If people get really tired and want to take a
nap, they can take a nap, but it sounds like everyone is going to
stay up for 24 hours.”

The group is hoping to raise at least 5250 from students.
Russell K, Osgood has said that he will rnareh every dollar do-
nated by the student body with personal funds.

“The whole troupe fell in love with the idea of doing a
marathon as a fundraiser,“ said Kathryn Thomas ’05. “Because
we had known a student who had volunteered with DVA/SAC
and spoke very highly of the organization, we decided that they
would be a good recipient for any money that we could raise."

DVA/SAC is a nonproﬁt organization that receives funds
from the federal government and is currently implemented in
four Iowa counties: Mare
shall, Jasper, Poweshiek
and Tama. It oFfers a W-
riety ot’ support for vic-
tims such as peer mun,
sding, a 24ehour horline,
support groups, safe
shelter, court advocacy
and medical advocacy,

Many local and na
tional businesses have
contributed to this event. -

“We ve gone to local businesses and invited people from rhe
community to come in,’ said VVainright ‘Its a local cause that a
lot otpeople on campus are in tune with. On the one hand, its
great ifyou can donate money, but rrs also great if people can
volunteer and raise awareness For this cause.

According to DVA/SAC, last year there were 856 cases of
victims of (loomestie violence and 79 cases of victims of sexual
\ssault' “1 the four counties. In Powcshiek County alone, therc
were 62 Cases of domestic violence and nine cases of sexual as-
sault,

Teresa McCall, the Poweshiek outreach coordinator, reports
that since September calls have increased.

“1 think that it's a bigger problem than people think because
victims don’t always come forward, and we aren't highly visible
right now,”McCall said. “It‘s not well known that we are avails
able, so having many advocates on campus will help increase
our visibility."

Currently there are 20 advocates on Grinnell's campus, and
10 more are undergoing training.

“I think [the improv marathon] is wonderful. It was kind of
a nice surprise.” said McCall.

”We are going [0 have a loiaf
coffee and a lot of/ied Bull Ii
mum: like everyone is going to
stay up for24 hours.”
