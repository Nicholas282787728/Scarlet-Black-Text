tions supporting the Gravel-Mon-
dale bill to end the war,

sponse noting the number 0! people

emphasized that they were not
buttonholing people, they were
simply making themselves avallr
able.

The telegram directed to Mr.

local Coverage Best In Years

Media coverage at orinnell pro-
test activities, although notasspec-
tacular as that ofseveralweeksago,
has been consistent and consistently
iavorable. Local coverage has been
increased to the highest level in
recent memory

KGRN has greatly expanded its cov-
erage of Gl'innell‘s activities,
Station owner Frosty Mitchell has
personally handled most of the work,
He tollowed Tuesday's downtown
march in KGRN’S mobile unit,
broadcasting a live description oi
the march as it occured, and culr
lninaling with live interviews of
President Leggett.

majority oi its information on the
Grinnell events through KGRN news,
Statewide coverage hasbcen conica—
surate with the Size of the demon»
strations, Monday evenlng'scandler
light marcti received especially de
tailed attention.

The AP dispatches emphasized the
degree of participation oi’ President

lowa radio stations picked up a tape
made by Loggett iroin his office

support oi the anti-war protests.

KDIC has once again begun sendr
ing and receiving telephoned reports
of events through the impromptu
niidwestel‘n college radio station
network which was established durr
ing the last Series of antirwardenlr
onstl'ations.

The Station has also been the cen-
ter of a Campus news collective,
although KDlC is notoiliciully spon-
soring the group David Lasley, Mike
Stm'n, Bill Thomas, and Mike
O'Coiiner felt that it was imperil-
tive to coordinate the medillettorts,
and immediately set to work or-
ganizlilg whit they call the inter-
mation is Freedom Collective

Although liinding was a problem,
the group has been iceding radio
material to Stations across the coun»
try on a tnirly regular basis, and

Nixon read: "We urge you to use
all expediehce in reversing your
policy concerning continuance oithe
war in Vietnam." Similar language
was used in the Wires directed to
Senators Hughes and Miller and Con-
gressman Kyl.

hisoiiice which was broadcast over
KGRN and later rebroadcast on
other radio stations in various parts
of the slate. Hi5 pronouncement

constructive eiiorts by both stur

and leaving notes tol'those whowere
out of their rooms.

More than 800 students responded
to the calls, and assembled at Her-
rick Chapel lar the march. Anne

of other stations.

Their main goal is to provide the
Grihnell community with as much
up to date information as possir
ble, and to provide the outside with
an accurate picture of events at
Grinnell.

Thursday's Des Moines demon—
stration was the lead news item on
most lown radio and television star
tions. Grinneil‘s involvement was
not directly mentioned; the emphar
sis was on the peaceiul nature or
the march and the thrust towards
change by political methods within
the system,

Overall, the Grinnell activities
have been buried in statewide and
national media coverage among
scores of other demonstrations in
other cities. However, there has
been a steady flow or inlormation,
and the major events have received
some notice,

are classitied by the federal go»
vernment as College iunds even
though they are completely student
administered) were used tor any
type of partisan political activi~

35 Elected To PBK

Beta Kappa was olticiilly an-
iiouiiced ill the chapel, on the lite
and music of Charles lves

This your is the iirst in tlie 64~
year history of tlie Grillilell chapter
when students have been electedber
[ore their senior years,

Mr Sch [2 said that lves had a
strong tnnii ririty with the music oi
rural America. because his lather
was a bandleader He received a
traditional education in music at Yale
University.

lves “(is not one to lead the life
or a struggling artist; instead he
became It Successful insurance
broker and wrote his music by night
But the arduous pace of the dual
existence caused a severe break-
down. so he was iorccd to choose,
and chose to end his activity as
a composer in 1920

lves considered the imposition oi
limitations not a virtue but a de-
iect and tried to incorporate as many
musical elements as he could think
of into his works Ml', Schwartz
played two recordings oi lves’ work.
but in so doing he advised the and»
ileum to abandon any notion of find-
ing consistency in the pieces. Us—
ulilly, he Said, eight to tCn hearings
are lcduiretl it one is to appreciate
lvos’ art.
