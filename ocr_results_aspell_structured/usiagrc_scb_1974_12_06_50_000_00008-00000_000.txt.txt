Swimmers ousted

byDaveSchechter

South Dakota State proved too
much lor the men’s swimming
team this past weekend, but
tomorrow could be another story.
This past weekend, the swimmers
tell to S.D,S. 5342 in a dual meet on
Friday; Saturday they iinished
second to them in the annual
Pioneer Relays. S,D.S. was first
with 54 points, Grinnell second with
40, and William Jewell was third
with 26.

Tomorrow the team faces South
Dakota State and several other
teams in a relay meet in
Brookings, South Dakota.
Meanwhile, tomorrow the womens’
team travels to Luther College ior

the Luther invitational.

South Dakota State, swimming
since September, won the dual
meet by taking the last event, the
too-yardrireestyle relay. In that
meet Bob Harder, a ireshman
irom South Dakota State, broke
Crinnell pool records in the zoo and
500 yard frestyle events. The next
day Harder and his teammates
won six events to clinch the all-
relays meet.

Grinnell did win two events
however. The trio oi om Rowat,
Greg olson, and Bob ters won
the SOD-yard Individual Medley
Relay. With both ltowat and
Olson around 2:15 for the 2004M
and Winters at 2:12, the team

Penn here tonight

By Dave Calvert
Basketball began with mixed
success Friday and Saturday at
Grinnell as the Pioneers. With a
new Coach, traveled to Oskaloosa,
1a., for the annual William Penn
Tip-Off Tournament. The Grinr
nellians, in an exact repeat oi last
year’s showing, lost to William
Penn in the initial Friday night
encounter and nabbed a third place
Tournament iinish by whipping
Graceland Saturday night.

The Friday night 7247 less to
Penn saw a scattered and inefr
iective group oi Pioneers, imr
mobilized by the tremendous
heightadvantageoithe Statesmen,
Led by a forward line all over 6-7,
the hosts forced numerous Grinnell
turnovers and held Coach Ron
Mitchell’s offense to a meager 35
per Cent shooting from the field.

The brightest spot in the opener
ior Grinnell was the play oi fresh»
man center Gunnar ”Gunner"
Thors. Stand 6-7, the Glencoe, Ill.,
native was the only Grinnellian in
double figures in scoring and the
top rebounder.

No grace inr Graceland

Saturday night's consolation
match, pitting Gl'innell against
Graceland, saw a totally different
brand oi play on the part oi the
Pioneers. Five Pioneers scored in
double figures, led by John Haigh's
20, as the Scarlet and Black
iromped ill-75.

Coach Mitchell noted the difr
irriicce. commenting :Illerw' rd,
“We played some fine hall."

Grinnell showed good poise,
rallying irom a three point half»
time deficit to a quick l4rpoint
lead. Although Graceland mounted
a determined comhack effort, the
strong shooting oi Haigh, Bill
Bailey, Craig Zippc, Scott Lewis,
and Thors protected the ad-
vantage.

Although generally pleased with
a 1-1 nonrconfercnce record, the
Grinnell players are looking to
improve. “We're working on our
height differential," said senlor
forward Rico Williams, adding
that he anticipates some lmr
provement by next semester, when
regular conlerence action begins.

Varsity basketball comes home
tonight, as the longelimbed William

Casey,Goetz
nab MVP’s

Jim Casey and Tom Goetz
walked off with another round of
awards last week, winning the
most valuable lineman and back
awards and capping extraordinary
individual seasons.

Each received the annual Dick
Ulrich, '33, trophies as most
valuable football players at
Grinnell ior the 1974 season.

For Coetz, only a junior now, it
was his second consecutive year as
the most valuable back.

Penners arrive for a second bout.
The contest will sorely test the
smaller Pioneers, but should serve
well towards preparing the squad
ior the tough competition coming
up in the Midwest Conierence
Gametime is set ior 7:30 pm.

Junior Varsity thisaiternoon

The junior varsity, coached by
John Hershey, will stage its own
little show at 5:15 in aiternoon

three point victory over the

looks strong in that event.

Later Olson Combined with Al
Six and Warren Smith to sweep the
300 yard breastroke relay. Olson,
Six. Smith, and Mark Smiley
provide Coach Ray Obermiller
with a strong breastroke corps, a
traditionally weak stroke in the
past.

The most exciting race oi the day
came in the 300 yard backstroke
relay. Winters was Grinnell’s
anchor man and entered the water
ten to fifteen yards behind S.D,S.
Winters split a 58.5 ior his loo yard
leg and lost the race by just inches.
Obermiller feels that once again
South Dakota State will be Grins
nell‘s top competition.

Women tune up

Though not swimming comr
petitively, the Grinnell women
participated in both meets this past
weekend, Coach Mike Daley can
look for an excellent Season based
on results oi this past weekend. in
the dual meet Virginia Munoz
highlighted the 200 [M by beating
the second male swimmer from

Cheryl Huntoon, Gail Machala,

Matmen drop opener

hyDzchalvert
Grinnell began its wrestling
season Wednesday night in the

same way it iinished the last one,.

with a loss. This time it was to a
strong William Penn squad, 33-14,
in a Physical Education Complex
home opener.

There are signs, however, that
times are changing. Although the
Pioneers are now wlnless in the
past 62 dual wrestling meets,
Coach Maurice Hunt’s team is now
entering the secoiii year oi a
strengthened program that has
yielded tangible improvements.
The team has begin to make more
respectable showi in the dual
meets, and a sulpr rig eighth
place iinishing last vcar at the
conference meet rals: i hopes ior
this year.

Hunt views the upci "ling season
with considerable hope, “We could
be in and possibly win a good
number of meets this winter if
everyone wrestles up to potential,"
he said.

Nightingale hangs tough
In Wednesday’s opener, Grinnell

profited by William Penn iorieits
in the 150 and 190 Weight
categories. 0n the winning end oi
the automatic six point wins were
senior Mark Genereux and fresh
man Carlo “Bo" deRosa.

Rich Nightingale, at in, put up
the best matrfight ior the Pioneers,
holding his man to a 1.1 tie. Each
wrestler escaped once ior the
holding his man to 171 tie. The
senior captain, heading ior his
iourth consecutive letter, was the
only Grinnellian to score points on
the mat deRosa, who took the 190
division by iorieit, wrestled to an s-
3 Setback in the unlimited
category, losing to a 275 lb.
behemoth irom Penn.

The other Grinnell starters, all oi
whom were pinned, are Stewart
Berr, 134; Peter Heckman, 142;
Dan Mosby, 151;; Hosea Engram,
167; and Bob Donelan, 177.

Next on the calendar for the
Pioneers is a Jan. 13 home meet

then the squad should be honed into
shape and ready to break that
winless streak.

The crunching sounds and the

this reporter as he eats his words
printed in last week’s 5&3. Barely

press for the rest of the season!

In the men's league the Prois are
undefeated and comfortably
situated atop the standings in the
South Division and Younkers
(Boo!) leads Langan and Clark-
Gates for first in the North. In the
Coed League the Haines Fitters
and Cowles-Rawson are engaged in
a vicious battle for first place with
Cleveland only a game behind and
threatening.
