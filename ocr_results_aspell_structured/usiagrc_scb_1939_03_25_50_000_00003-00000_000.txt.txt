KODAKS

‘ should

By Carl Niemeyel‘.

It is strange that in this time of
international tension any war play
“date"; but “Joumey's
End," only ten years ago the
popular success of London and
New York, shows its age.

It was never a good play; there
was always too much talk, talk
about tootball and cricket and
rock gardens in Sussex and
archeological remains in tiie New
Forest, and too little action.

Now six months after Munich,
when reterences to England's
honor are embarrassing rather
than sentimental, the play seems
more than ever to lack, to put it
bluntly, guts. It turns out to be
instead an interminable teaparty,
as remote from the war as from

Chapel Program

Sunday: Vespers—B. c. Berg,

Monday; John P. Ryan. pro-

logy, will speak.

chorus

the planet Mars.

Thursday's actors, under Alfred
Boylen‘s direction, struggled heroi-
cally with the script and were
sometimes successful.

As always in the drama dee
partrnentls productions, technical
details were well handled; but the
acting, largely because for any
but protessionais the play is pro-
bably unactable, was occasionally
instead of uniformly good.

Two minor players, Joe Wall as
Mason the cook and Hal Hardin
as Trotter, furnished some much
needed comic reliei. William Seld—
ler as Osborne acted with dignity
that never was pompous or
solemn,

 

Whatever plot the play has cons
cerns the emotional feeling be-
tween stanhope and Raleigh. The
burden upon the actors in those
ioles is considerable, as Browne
Barr as Stanhope and Robert

‘Kinsey as Raleigh understood.

Both successfully presented cer»
tain aspects of the characters.
Although Barr could have made
Stanhope a more believable
diunkard and Kinsey could have
made Raleigh a more believable
soldier, capable of snatching
single-handed a man from the
enemy trenches, still Barr did
well in emphasizing Stanhope's
enictionalism and Kinsey in ems
phasizing Raleigh‘s puzzled bc-
Wilderment.

Those who missed the play on
Thursday will not be wasting their
tune by seeing it tonight.
