Workers’ rights
disputes spill
into sports

MlNNEAPOLIS, Minn.

ersion lasr monrh ro join rhe
Worker Rights Consorrium mighr
evenrually lighren rhe universiry’s
pockerbook by more rhan just rhe

lasrThursday, Nike terminated
irs conrracr with Brown universiry
after school ofﬁcials tried to ten:-
goriare rheir conrraer in accordance
with the WRC code of conduct, a
ser ofsrandards championed by Stu»
denrs, swearshop acrivisrs and ot—
ganizcd labor groups narionwide.

ln anriciparion or this Friday’s
founding W'RC meeting, rhe move
has raised more than a few eyebrows
at universities nationwide.

Nike ofﬁcials say the WC is
eounrerproducrive because corpo-
rations are not allowed to sit at the
consorrium’s bargaining table, an
exclusion drey say ereares disrrusr
berween all invesrcd patties.

Simon vesrridge, Nike’s labor
pracrices manager, says rhe Carper
rarion prefers rheir membership in
the Fair Labor Association (FLA),
an alrernarive labor-monitoring
group criticized by acrivisrs and or-
ganized labor for carering roo
heavily ro eorporare inreresrs.

“We’ve been involved with these
labor issues for a long rime, and we
know how to make improvemenrs in
the factories,” PesLtidge said. “What
you're saying with rheWRC is diarwo
don't know how to do that.”

Pestrldgc said Nike will deal

wirh each universiry on a per con.
rracr basis. Bur rhe Universiry of
Minnesora, whose men’s and
women's basketball and hockey
reams and football ream all sporr
uniforms bearing rhe company's
trademark swoosh, could ﬁnd itself
in rhe same precarious position
once die WRC is fully esrabllshed.

Ar issue, in pan, is rhe srrucrure
ofeach individual contract.

Brown Universiry was in rhe
second year ofa three-year deal that
provided equipmenr ro meir men's
hockey ream ar wholesale prices.

In inrerviews on Tuesday, Uni-
versity General Counsel Mark
Retenbetg said he needs ro review
each team's specific Nike deal be»
fore evaluaring rhe Universlry's
prospeers of experiencing similar
difﬁculties with the Oregon-based
apparel giant.

lrdie universiry's sideline con»

year and made Nike one or rhe

But some aerivisrs say rhe con.
tract termination is nothing more
than a gloriﬁed scare tactic to leave
connicr ar rhe rable as WRC repre-
sentatives a‘nd oﬁicials sit down to
structure the organization. The
wave ofWRC support has trumped
FLA new membership oflate, and
many activists say the WRC could

“Nike is just trying to scare the
schools because they’re afraid the
