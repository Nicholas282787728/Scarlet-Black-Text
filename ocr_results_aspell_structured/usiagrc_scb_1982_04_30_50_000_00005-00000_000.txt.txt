conveniently graduated, leaving behind a
passive and naive student body which has
no conception of all that the college has
stood for in the past. I counted approx-
imately 20 freshmen at the open forum and
less than that at the meeting last week in
the grill. I see all I perceive as Grinnell
College crumbling before me and coupled
with this is the nagging doubt that we will
not ultimately have any impact on the fate
of our college. i feel that the next step we
must take is in the direction of better com-
munication in the Sense that one Student
phrased it, “We can talk about com-
munication but sometimes We need to
communicate," ,

As was suggested by Jim Rabchuk, we
need a statement from the administrators
informing us of what possible changes they
would like to see at the college in the next
five years or so. How does each feel,
specifically, on issues such as tenure decir
sions, core curriculum, etc? The studean
should present the administration with a
similar statement along with the 800-plus
signatures accumulated in last week,
Perhaps the gap caused by vagueness and

study program in the amount of $267,000
with only $62,000 coming from federal
sources, As we have seen a decrease in me
amount of federal National Direct Student
Loans, we have been able to loan college
monies instead.

As I compare our financial assistance
program to those of other schools, two
things immediately stand out. One, that
Gnnnell traditionally has supported a
larger percentage of its students with
financial aid and. secondly, that the major
portion of this aid continues to be in the
form of scholarship dollars from the Col-
lege. 7 John R. Hopkins, director of Ad-

Fellow Students:
You say that the administration is makr

«sing decisions at Grinnouyitho‘ul regard to . ,

. student opinion. You say, that they are
disregarding procedluzesand’qiat when
decisions aré§made they seem In befu-
bitrary and unjustifiable. You say that a
feeling of authoritarianism is perceived
because students are communicating their
idms to the administration but the ad-

. ministration is not explainiiigto uswhat is
happening.

This week we got, at least in theory,
some response from the administration.
The four most powerful administrators
and the chairman of the faculty agreed m
sit down and explain to us what it is they
do, who has what power and how decisions
are made. They communicated with us: a
definite achievement for us. So, when you
finally got a chance to learn of some of the
inner workings of the administration, what
did you do'l You complained that these
four administrators and one faculty
member were talking too much, not giving
students enough time. You wanted to talk
but not to listen. Besides being hide, this is
just plain stupid. The administration was
giving us the inside on its strategy. They
were giving us information which could
help us in accomplishing what we want,
but you don't want to hear it.

Many will argue that the five speakers
weren’t really saying anything. I grant
that much of what was said was a useless
listing of duties and a denial of power.
However, a flat dismissal of all that was
being said as useless ts being close~minded
and intellectually lazy, Parslow's percep-
tion of Drake as monarch, Drake's
description of himself as the liason bet-
ween the college community and the
trustees and the assurance that students

the excess of personal gripes could then

Until we define our goals and distance
ourselves enough to be objective and be
able to avoid blind emotion and anger, as
these weaken our case, we will continue to
be powerless, i personally find an uncoma
fortable irony in the increase in tuition in
direct relation to the decrease in powerful
student input potential. it we must come
down to terms of money. as we invariably
must, what are we ultimately paying for at
Grinnell”. Is it Worth it?

We must thank Prrsident Drake, Dean
Frazer, Dean Tederiiian, Dean Walker
and Min Parslow, as well as our fellow,
students for the real concern for Grinnell
College expressed at the open forum. We
must also continue our efforts towards the
preservation of our college in the little
time remaining this yeari Let's hold on to
the philosophy and backbone of what we
perceive as Grinnell, It is much easier to
correct the problem now, than to attempt
to reinstitute policies later.

were welcome to talk to administrators at
any time all had value to me. I'm sure
others got something out of it.

More importantly, even it it were true
that the administrators had said absolute-
ly nothing, it would still be important that
we attempt to listen to them talk. II die ad-
ministration perceives that students are

, not receptive fathom. why should they Btu
tempt totell as anything or listen to us?
Our goal is communication, not alienation.

I agree with your cause. My social cons
cience has been suiticientyly aroused into
genuine concern about this issue So, you
may ask, why come down so hard on
students for an error which is so slight
compared wiﬂi what the administration
has done? It is because I don’t want you to
fail! I don't want to see this turn into a
stalemate between two unyielding,
unreceptive sides with most of the power
remaining on their side Further, it is an
example of a bigger problem on this cam»
pus. People often get so caught up in the
battle that they forget why it is being
fought. As Mr. Magurshak urged in the.
forum last week, we have to always keep
ourgoals in mind. We must consta stop

Last Thursday's Dierln was an attempt

to express their fears and concerns; your
group gathered instead to drink beer,
listen to Apocalypse Now and ridicule our

your activities detracted trom the event by
making it almost impossible to hear Mr,
F‘rend'l. No one forced you to attend the

The next time you intend to make your

Won’t you come

This allegory was presumed at the divestment

Feb. 6, 1982

Once upon a time in a remote British
colony, a small group of businesspeople
got together and decided that their society
was unjust. They decided to throw a party
to call attention to the problem. Now this
wasn‘t going to be just any party. It was
going to be a tea party. in order to protest
the injustice in their society they planned
to throw a bunch of British tea into the
local harbor. what a crazy ideal

Well, one guy went out to ask his friends
to the party. The first friend said, “i can't
come to your tea party because that would
be disloyal to the king, go away." The se-
cond friend said, “I won't come to your tea
party because i think some loyalists will
come and fish the tea out of the bay and
sell it and then you'd get nowhere." uie

stupid idea because the British could

In this week's Memo, students are in
Vited to take part in the “Fog Fast for
Salvadoran Refugees" and so “enjoy their
first well-balanced meal of the semester
by eating offcampus." I hope that i am not

alone in saying that this statement
distresses me a great deal Such sarcastic
comments concerning the food here at
Grinnell are, i am sad to say. a very coma
mon occurrence. This “humorous" invita-
tion (ha! ha! laughs the refugee families
wondering where they will next have a
meal) is, I assume, pu: out by Students
Against Suffering: El Salvador, who are

the organizers of the Fast. To see them,

join in with such sick sarcasm is most
depressing.

the way in which the question‘tl load is aps
proached by we privileged peoples
(English attitudes differ little from those
here in the States). Since we have such an
abundance of food; two or threebmyeals
each day: with snacks in between, we
have, .1 i'ear, become “spoilt little brats,"
preferring to concern ourselves with sucn
globally important topics (excuse my own
tint of sarcasm) as administration pro-
cedures here at Grinneﬂ, (How many

always sell their tea to some other cola
onies. A fourth friend said. “I really agree
with your cause but i don't know if having
a tea party is the way to go about it.”

But some friends came to the tea party
and along with the small group of
businesspeople and many others they con-
tinued to work toward their goals. After a
lot of bleeding and sweating they formed a
new government proclaiming freedom and
equality for everyone,

The tea party was just one little thing
that helped to torward their cause. '

Well, as it turns out, those people didn't
quite mean everybody when they talked
about freedom and equality. So we're still
having tea parties. Two blocks from l'cre
there is a small group of businesspeople
who could help us to make our tea party a
little bigger, They may decide not to come
to our tea party but that doesn't mean the
party is over. So what have we got to lose.
let's go ask the trustees, “Won‘t you come
to our tea party?"

Take a moment or two if you can sparc
them to truly think about what it means to
go without food. . . What will it take for us
to truly appreciate what it means to simp

still (since Grinnell is a little distant from
Central America) try going without food

To the Editor:

Gates Hall is a dormitory composed of
about 45 members of the campus coma
munity. Although its occupants have not
made a collective decision since the cat
vote, there have been many actions taken
and many statements made concerning
the occupants as if they were a collective
unit ttbey have evaibeen referred to as a
fraternity). ' " ‘

Such an attitude assumes that the ac-
tions of tome-peoplaon whom the judge.-
ment is based are representative‘of each
group member's actions or are the result
of a group decison. This is not true inthe
case of Gates Hall and I suspect that it is
not true of other groups which suffer fre-
quent judgement. As an individual who
happens to be a resident of Gates Hall, i
wish to be judged on my own actions and
not those of any other individual or in
dividuals; likewise, my actions are not a
valid basis for judgement of other in
dividuals, —- Arlin Stoltzfus, 4213 Gates
