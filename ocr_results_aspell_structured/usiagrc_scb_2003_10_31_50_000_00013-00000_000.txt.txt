East St. Louis

The Alternative Break trip to ﬁrst st. Louis sparked lmmy ditrerenr
feelings among its participants Led by sophomores Molly Goodtvine
Kuclnsky and David Wylie, the group worked to demolish and rebuild a
porch on a .esidents house as part orrhe Emerson Park Development
Corpomuon. The otmnitation runs a school for high school dropouts to
get meirGED’s and teachesskills such asmrperrtry. During the evenings.
the participants helped hand out Food, Clorhmg and toiletries at Holy
Angels. a homeltss shelter.

“It was aman’ng to meet women who live in homeless shelters and to
actually put food in die hands othomeleo people," said Jake Dingmm
‘07.

Many of the paro'eipane were struck by how dirreront East 5L Louis
is eamparod to mueh ofwhar drey knew growing up. ForWylie, itwas his
ﬁrst time in st Louis and he was aware ofthe degree orurhan dmy and
dilapidation there was in die may as were other students.

“It was kind of smy, how much same there was," said Goodwin-
Kueinsley. “This one hooker was running down die Shut widr a pair or
seissors in one hand and a serrated knife in d1c other yelling ‘i‘m gonna
get you all to these guys selling drugs on me eomer. Thar was rhe ﬁrst
day."

“Itvims hard to see so many people in need but to be unable to help
them all in a deﬁnite and permanentway,” said Chrisdnevigeland‘oa "I
think dial it has encouraged me to do more servioe work ordiis sort.”

Interacting with people in the arm mve many a new perspeeo‘ve,
ineluding Sarah Johnson ‘06, who said it was often dt'irieult to put eaeh
odrer's differences aside and talk to meh other. The most mcam oer
perienee ﬁn Wylie was getting to learn about the live and ehallengrs or
many of d1c homelss men they helped.

Dingman noted that while eating or the af:r:ria orthe school ror
hryr school dropouts, many of H1: students had no family and livod on
the streets. “I ennldn't even think oranydring to start a oonversation with
them.” he said.

The weekwasdiiricult, but the group also had run, Notonly did they
get to tear down die old porch ar the raidclw: where dicy were working

 

so that they eould rebuild it again, they ate a lot or parrotkts, erashed a
private party at the eity museum and played wheeldrarr basketball in the
ehnreh where they were staying.

“The people who ran me ehureh we stayed in drought we were mix»
sionaries. Tlmrwas runny, sinre mosroruswere atheists," said Dingman.
in the end, the erperienoe proved hoth oreiring and frustrating for many
orthe pm’tlclpanrs. “I wish theyeould give our job: lnsrmd orsandwidras,"
said Drngman.

Chicago

Led by Kaﬁla Odesanya ’04 and Mahi Demissie ‘06, the group or
ninestudeno who went to Chicago's Southside worked with a variety of
organizations, Their pans ofull included su Casa Cad-.olieWorlter, Port
Ministries and a Had start program at Christopher How. In addition
to tutoring, the group helped out by cooking mods. doing chem at str
Cas: CadtoiicWotkermd performing maintenantework on some build-
ings for winter. They also put on 1 multicultural presentation for the
children to talkahout all the dilrerent plates the Grinnellians were from.
indudr'ng Ethiopia. Nigeria, Costa Rios, Idaho and Kansas.

Aaeording to Demissie, tutoring many or the children was a chal-
lenge, heoiute many armem did not speak English. “Mast orrhe kids
were immigranu or ﬁrst generation and only spoke Spanish," she said. “A
few membcls otonr group spoke Spanish, but most didn’t.”

Though language prsentod a rather large barrier at ﬁrst, many par-
tieipanrs discovered even more eomplex challengm. “It was rally hard
working with the kids," said patrieipanr Kevin Wood ‘07. “and realizing
dreywere no different than all orus and ,usrassmart. out that rheywould
never have any ordre opportunities we have had.”

The experience of interacting widr the daddren was very rewarding
for many orrhe partieipanrs, espoeiaily Odesnnyar “The best part for
me was that it took ,usrso little effort to help these kids," she said “Izwas
jtot oool being around [them], llrarrrod more about myselE"

Demissie and Odrsanya said diathy doing Alternative Break daey got
to know many Grinnellians better, as well as some amazing people in
Chirsigo.
