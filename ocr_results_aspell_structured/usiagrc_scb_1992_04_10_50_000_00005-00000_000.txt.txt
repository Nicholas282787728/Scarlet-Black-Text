Prestigious Antarctica explorer delivers convocation

By Karen Nutter

He has had both a mountain range
and a glacier named after him. He is
one ofa select group of people in the

world who can say they are amtipital,'

meaning they have been to both the
nonh and south “poles". He has re-
ceived medals, awards and recogni-
tion from countries allover lheworldt
And Professor David Campbell '
Lloduced him as one of ”an increas-
ingly rare breed of humans," a true
explorer who has sctfoot in places no
one had gone before and none have
gone since. He is Dr. Charles
Swithinbank, senior associate of the
ScottPolachsearchlnstitntein Cam»
bridge, England, and his April 2 con-
vocation address, entitled “Antarc—
lica1950-1990: The ChangingScene"
was part of last week‘s symposium
on “Continent at the Crossroads:
Antarctica in a Resource Age."
Swithinbank's hour-long
presentaion included remarks on his
40 expeditions to Antarctica from
1950 lo the presan the scientiﬁc
experiments and discoveries in which
he has taken part, and a slide show.
His wry sense of humor and a seem»
ingly endless list of interesting per»
sonal anecdotes also entertained his
crowded Harris Cinema audience.

Swithinbank began his presenta-
tion by describing the inauspicious
beginnings of his expeditions to the
ice-bound south. In the early 1950’s,
heand l4 othermen,including geolo-
gists. surveyors. seismologists and a
doctor just out of medical school.
travelled to the region on a whaling
ship, built their own base, and used
dogsleds, tractors and a small air-
plane for trasportation. Except for a
tempermental radio, they lived come
pletely isolated from the rest of the
world for two years.

Living in this unexplored region
was exciting.Swithinbankcxplalned,
because everything one saw and cxe
penencet‘l was new and almostcom-
plctcly undocumented. Every study
done on their surroundings, whether
it was in meteorology, glaciology, or

oceanography. contained virtually
landmark discoveries. A doctor, for
example. who casually picked up a
rock and discovered some unknown
type of insects beneath it,documented
What he found and eventually had the
insects named after him. “It was that
easy,"Swithinbankstated,todiscover
new things.

This isolated and adventurous life
also had its dangers and complica-
tions,Swithinbank stated. Surveying
and aerial photography were imporr
tant, he reminded his audience. be-
cause“lhcre wereofcourscnomaps."
Several men driving in a tractor went
over the edge of the ice and drowned
in the freezing water. And when a
piece of chipped rock accidentally
became embedded in one man‘s eye,
since no specialist could be called in
to care for it, the doctor and volun-
teers had to receive instructions by
radio on how to remove the entire
eye.

Despite these dangers,
Switltinbank said, that when the two
years were up, most of the men did
not want to leave. A shortage of
funds, however, forced them to retum
nonh. The work is very expensive,
Swithinbank explained, because of
uansponation problems; because99%
of the region is covered by ice, move
ing around is difficult, and this ac-
counts for 80 to 90% of the expense.

In 1957, twelve nations,including
Britain, the Soviet Union and the
United States, banded together to ex-
plore the Antarctic. To solve the
problems caused by all these differ-
entnations claiming soveriegnity over
the region. in 1959 the Antarctic
Treaty was created. This document.
according to Swithinbank, is a good
example of “diplomatic
doublcspeak", for in effect it recog-
nizes tlte differentnational claims on
the region, and yet recognizes the
right of some nations to ignore the
claims of others. Swithinbank ex-
pressed his gratitude for the politi-
cians and their ability to keep the
peace, and allow work to continue
in an international atmosphere, with

Multiethnic Coalition kicks
off second symposium

By India Weston

"Weaving A Tapestry Of Culr
tures," the title for the second annual
Multiethnic Coalition Symposium,
was introduced with a workshop on
language and common culture, The
workshop. held Tuesday in South
Lounge, was led by individual mem
bers of the coalition.

The purpose of the workshop was
to explore how individuals contribute
to, and internalize American culture.
How are we all different and how are
we the same?

The workshop was made up of
three exercises. intended to getpeople
to share their perceptions about their
individuality and conceptions of cul-
ture. The first exercise centered
around different objects. Workshop
participants were asked to identify
where those objects originated.

The second exercise was to come
pose a list of Grinnell culture. This
portion developed into a more elabo-
rate discussion and problem of trying
to “define” American culture, Itcan-
not be done in simple termsiperr
haps not in any terms. because even
panicularcultures,suchas Grinnell's.
are made up of varying cultures.
Through this exercise, diversity, the
fundamental aspect of the coalition,
was appreciated.

The third and ﬁnal exercise was
one in which everyone gotachance to
deﬁne what made them unique. In
order to reinforce this notion and im-
ponance of individuality while stress-
ing commonality, yarn was passed
from each person as they spoke. In
using the yarn, the idea was to create
a web. symbolizing a connection be-
tween everyone despite the differ-
ences.

no wretched business
sovericgnity.”

Swithinbank began workittg with
United States teams in 1959,when he
was asked to help measure the move-
mentoflargeglacicrs. Helaterworkod
with a team from the University of
Michigan, on a study of the Ross
Shelf, which is an ice shelf approxi-
matcly the size of Texas. He and the
team spent three years in the Antarc-
tica studying this strange mass, while
the United States, according to
Swithinbank, spent millions of dole
lars to help them do it.

Swithinbankalso spentmuch time
With Soviet teams, learning Russian
along the way. He described sharing
“convivial evenings” with the Sovi»
eLs, and how pleasant it was that“all
the propaganda was laid aside" in
favor of science and adventure.

Swithinbank was in England.
forming an institute for the study of
glaciology, when it was discovered
tllat radio waves could penetrate ice,
giving scientists the opportunity to
ﬁnally measure the depth of the im-
possible Antarctic terrain.
Swithinbank learned of this and went
the next season to Antarctica with an
international team. They collected
many ice depths on this expedition.
learning thaton average, tlte ice of the
Antarctic is 8000 feet mick.

When the Faulklarlds War began
in 1982, (which occurred.
Swithinbank pointed out, exactly ten

of

years ago last week) he and another
scientist were called to discuss the
war‘s proximity to Antarctica with
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Over gin and tonic,
Swithinbank remembered jovially,
Thatcher “ﬁred off" ninety minutes
of questions at them, mainly relating
tohowlong the Antarcticabasecould
defend themselves in case of attack.
Swithinbank was honest: ifthe base,
consisting ofa “bunch of scientists"
were attacked. they would be able to
defend themselves for about one
minute. Their answers apparently
satisfied her concerns, and
Swithinbank and his colleagues later
boasted that they had received ninety
minutes with Thatcher, while Presir
dent Reagan received only thirty.

Although Swithinbank described
himself as a “has—been" who offi—
cially retired in 1986, he has since
made several trips to Antarcticaonce
with a U.S. crew who wanted him to
help them continue surveying the re
gion.

Swithinbank expressed some an-
noyance at those environmentalists
who oppose continued exploration of
Antarctica. Calling some of these
environmentalists “single—minded fa-
natics", who “alienate" themselves
by not “adhering to the facts", he
claimed that only a “very small part
[of Antarctica] in every small way” is
disturbed, and that pollution of the
region comes for the most part from

other countries. He claimed that
Antarctica is the “cleanest place in
the world" and that expressed his
desire for environmentalists to stick
to the facts. and not be governed by
their emotions.

Swithinbankblamed journalists for
propagating most of the misinfomta-
tionwhichiscirculatedaboutAntarc-
ticat One of the most important. he
stated, is that Antarctica is rich with
minerals, which should be mined.
Having already asserted that 99% of
Antarctica is covered with ice 8000
feet thick, it is plain to see why the
extraction of these minerals would be
exuemely difﬁcult, if notimpossible.
The other piece of misinformation is
that the Antarctic Treaty was due to
expire in 1991. Nothing expired in
that year, Swithinbank said, because
the treaty is permanent and always
has been.

Swithinbank closed his presenta-
tion with a slide show, which in-
cluded pictures of camps buried in
snow, the “incredibly inefﬁcient but
wonderfully romantic" dog sleds, and
the coldest place on earth, a place
which measured in “medieval units”
reaches lows of -129F. He also in-
cluded manypicnrres of his colleages,
past and present. Many were of dif-
ferentnationalities, and he mentioned
that that wm the nice thing about the
expeditions, that it was science and
comraden'e that was important, and
that “nationality didn‘t matter."
