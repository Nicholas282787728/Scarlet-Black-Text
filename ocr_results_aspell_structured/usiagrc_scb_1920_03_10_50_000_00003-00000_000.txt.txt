.lT Tun COLON'IA ..
Eloi'cilce Vidor and zoSu Pitts are
seen in excellent characterizations in
”Four Relations," the Brentwood pro-
auction released by RobertsonCoie.
Miss Vidoi‘, who played the lcztd in
"The Other Half,” a. recent Brentwood
pictnrr‘e and Miss Pitts, Who scored
heavily as "The Jazz Kid” in the same
production, have sharply contrasted
roles in "Poor Rotations" t hat give
them splendid opportunities for their
strongly individualized talents.
Dorothy Perkins (Miss Vidal‘) and
Daisy Perkins (Miss Pitts), were up-
posites in everything but their name
and origin. Dorothy was ambitious
and artistic, and longed for the en—
vironment and reﬁnements which
Wealth could bring. Daisy was full of
mischief, buoyant and inclined to he
“jazzy." ‘
Dorothy realized her ambition, but
it almost broke hel‘ heart. Daisy stay»
ed in the little country town, inztl‘ried
her father's clerk, who was transform~

when he bought a iiivvcr and dolled
tum store clothes, and found happi—
nose.

Miss Vidorts portrayal of the girl
who married into high‘ society and
found only disillusionment and heart
achcs where she had expected culture
and rciinelnont, is appealing and con-
vincing. As Daisy, thc higrhcai‘ted
liltle inw-hron l-ondeh, Miss Pitts
adds new ianrcls to those she has al-
ready gained by her inimitahlo char-
acterizations at seriOvcomlc roles
