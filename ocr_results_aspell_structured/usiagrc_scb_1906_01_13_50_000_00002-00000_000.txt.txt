PROFESSOR LOEBu-HIS WORK

AND “memes.

1I‘he following is It brief outline of
the paper presented beiore (lie Hum-
boldt Society, last. Thursday evening,
by Professor Norris:

Newspaper accounts of Proiessor
Loeb’s worlr have been largely sensa-
tional and far from the truth. He has
never claimed to be able to produce
life art ally. In his own Words:
“It is possible to get the liiephenome-
Tia under control.” His Work has
taken the form of three methods of at-
tempting to control theliie-phcnomenn
in three dillcrent ways: 1. Control
oi movement; 2. Control or regellera»

. n and organiormation; 3. Control
oi the development or the egg.

In his experimentation on the coil»
tml of movement he has elaborated
the Theory of Tmpisms, according to
which inany of the movements (includ-
ing most of tiieiustinctire ones) of ill)-
inials are produced directly and me-
chemically by the stimulation of natr
~irratl forces alone.

The common notion that in place of
it lost port or organ there is regenera
ted. ii at all. a similar part 01‘ organ,
has been disproved it! Lueb and his
school, for he has been able to replace
a lost organ by a totally d -ent one
He has been able to do what no One be-
fore him has done; regenerate a nerr.
ous system in some animals.

The Old idea that the egg must be
Viertilized before it will develop. has
‘been completely contradicted by Loeb.
He has caused eggs to develop without
Tertilization by olterating their chem-
ical and physical condition. LWithin
the last year he has caused this artiﬁ-
‘cial development to imitate almost
perfectly the natural one that results
on fertilization.

He has also overthrown another
"widespread opinion; that a hybrid can
be produced only between :closely al-
llied species. He has produced a. hy-
brid between a starﬁsh and used-urn
-chin by varying the normal chemical
conditions of fert .ation.

'But in no case is he producing liie.
’ﬂe is merely controlling nature’s pro-
cesses and directing them in new
channels.

'The results or his researches are fat-
Teaching. His work has him a pro-
tound iiiiiuence upon psychology. He
has given us a new dellnition or con-
sclousness. His vigorous attacks up
on the commonly accepted i-ieivs of in,
stincts has led to a marked revision of
opinion upon that sublect. Ills ex-
pcriments in the eﬂect of chemicals

upon the li ng substance will doubly
less lead to practical results in the
treatment and prevention oi disease.
To the scientist his work is Oi especial
value [or the promise in it of {l deeper
insight into nature’s processes in the
evolving or living things as they are,
and for the hope that some day man
may be able to mould and shape the

plast
undreamed

l' ing substance into forms yet
and not only tl air the

SCARLET AND BLACK

thoughts ril God but do his works.

Pi-oiessci- Lent is an out and out Ina:
tericlist. But his philosophy is a hope
iul one ior it gives promise o[.pl‘ogress
through triumph over nature and the
transmission or the uequiremcuts oi
one generation to another.

in his address Mr. Bailey spoke oi
the iuture of the Chrestomcthian
Society and the necessity for hard
work on the part at the members if
its standards are to be kept up to
those of the past. “This is an age
or competition,” he said. “competi-
tion brings‘out men.” This is no-
where more true than in Literary
Sacieby work. Bespoke or the com-
petition between the two men’s soci-
eties and predicted a bright future for
