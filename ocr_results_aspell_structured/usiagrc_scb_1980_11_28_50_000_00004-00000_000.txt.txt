Beer stolen in Pub burglary

by Ellen Heath
During the early morning hours of
Saturday, Nov. 8, the college Pub was
burglarized, resulting in the theft ot
four cases of beer, Since that time,
members of the Pub Board have been
trying to deClde on a course of action.
The cleaning person, who was in the
Pub at the time of the break-in.
reportedly saw four people on the
premises and was able to identify two of
them: students Harry Ayling and Rich
Kellnicker. Later in the day, the names
of the two students were given to the
police. Two more men, student Pat
Walsh and former student John
Cavanaugh, then stepped forward.
Charges against me four were never
pressed, however, the police sent let-
ters of intent to the suspects. The Pub
Board formed a committee, including
Pub Board President Bruce

Feichtinger, board member Kevin
Crim, and Pub Manager Tom Kozal, to
check into the legal implications of the
incident. The four men could have been
pressed with charges of second degree
burglary, which is a class C felony.

The committee recommended that
the charges not be pressed, but the final
decision rested with the Court Attorney.
The Pub is, technically, nota partof the
college . but a town business and.
therefore, not in the college’s jurisdic-
tion. Barb Gaddis. a board member,
said the Attorney, “respected the
wishes of the committee."

Not all of the board members are
happy with the committee's decision,
though. According to one member, who
wishes to remain anonymous, the come
mittee "acted out of turn . . , meyiwere
in power to collect information, not

make decisions,"

The charges were not pressed
because, as one board member said.
“We couldn‘t see charging a student for
a theft of four or five cases of beer."

According to Crim, “It was in the best
interests of the Pub if the charges were
dropped."

In Iowa, though, there is a Statute oi
Limitations which allows the state to
press charges up to three years after
the date of the offense, At a meeting on
Wednesday. Nov. 19, the Board decided
it would take action to expel the
students. who were members or the Pub
Club, from the Pub.

Information about the break-in was
kept confidential by the Board and
managers of the Pub because, said
Feichtlnger, they "didn‘t want publicl»
ty to iniluence the decision."

Women’s health care problems reviewed

by Sydney Henlbom

During the past month, the issue of
women's health care in Grinnell has
been a major topic of discussion by
members of the Women's Group and
several administrators from the Stu-
dent Affairs Office. The issue arose
because of the discontinuation of health
care services to the Women‘s Group by
both the Emma Goldman Clinic in Iowa
City and Cedar Rapids Clinic for
Women in Cedar Rapids.

The main problem with health care
services within the Grinnell region
stems from the lack of alternatives
beyond the level of the General Practlr
tioner. In the past, Women's Group has
shuttled groups of students to Emma
Goldman and Cedar Rapids. But that
option is no longer available.

The two clinics decided recently to
suspend services to the Women's Group
for two reasons, First, when groups of
college women went to the clinics,
many times individuals would fall to
make their appointments, The clinics
said that this was a waste of their ap»
pointment time and was taking away
from their availability to other women.
Second, the clinics decided that it was
unreasonable to give such large blocks ‘

of time to the groups of women who
were visiting the clinics

It is the concern of both the Women's
Group and Student Affairs that the
health care needs of the campus women
are met. These needs include
gynecological services, pelvic exams,
abortion referrals, and methods and
uses at birth control. Many women also
wish to attract a female practitioner or
experienced woman to provide services
for the campus. either within the com-
munity (lie. the hospital) or at the
Health Center.

After the open forum held on Nov. 5,
an ad hoc committee was formed to
draft a written proposal stating the
health care needs oi the campus
women. The committee was formed
and met last Wednesday, Nov. 19, to
write up a proposal to be presented to
Jim Tederman. dean of Student Affairs.

The committee itself is made up of
four students, Jeanne Zimmerman,
Ellen McDonald, Kendra Zirbel, and
Lynn Rossmann, and three Student Af-
fairs administrators, Barb Gaddis,
Susan Whittwnn and Janet Carl.

The proposal basically deals with the

health care for female members of both
the college and the Grinnell communle
ty. Proposed services include
gynecological services, birth control
devices, and abortion referrals; all pro-
vided by a female practitioner or physi-
cian's assistant.

With the future of Grinnell College’s
Health Center under question, the comr
mittee decided it was necessary to com-
bine its needs with those of the Grinnell
community. The committee also hopes
to keep the option of using the Health
Center as a resource station for health
care services open.

The proposal has been drafted and
presented to Tederman. The committee
hopes to meet with Tederman before
Winter Break to determine the needs of
Grinnell women.

Both the Women‘s Group and the Stur
dent Affalrs Office hope to have the
issue of women's health care under con-
trol in the near future, but they are un-
sure how soon this will take place.
Because of the current situation with
the college's Health Center and the
discontinued shuttle service to Iowa Cl-
ty or Cedar Rapids, the committee en-
courages women seekin gynecological
services to make lndi dual appomtr
ments with either clinic,
