lishing the index oi the scientiiic litr
‘erattul‘e or the world. Fourteen anrl
‘inlal issues, each or seventeen vol-

the literature l'rom 1901 to 191;. The:
results or the rvar together with the,
much increased cost oi printing and-
publishing have interrupted the un-
dertahing and no index oi screntilic
literature published since 1914 has
been issued. The conierence decided
that even though a change may be
made iii the luturc in the method or
Erndcxing and at publishing the index,
as has oiten been suggested .it is ime
per-ativcly necessary to continue the
literature published up to the end or

end oi 1920 has been catalogued.
