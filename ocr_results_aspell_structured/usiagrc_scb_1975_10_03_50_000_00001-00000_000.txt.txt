s. Ambassador cautions

.U.S. needs European unity

by Lynn Voedisch
Speaking as an American strongly tied to
Europe, tormer Ambassador to the
European Community J. Robert Schaetzel
stresses his View of the need for a united
Europe. In his lectures last Tuesday and
Wednesday nights and in private interview,
the Woodrow Wilson guest lecturer
repeatedly focused on the need for America
to develop a consistent foreign policy
towards a united Europe.
Americans. at present, says Schaetzcl,

are not very interested in Europe or

I anywhere else. He feels this is due to a
“limited Span of attention;" people are so
concerned with the economic and social
problems at home. that they cannot see
long-range foreign issues.

3 “I don't see a negative tocus (towards

‘ European unity) in the populace," says
Schaetzel. But, he does perceive “subs
merged hostility" in the State Department,
Secretary of State Henry Kissenger, ac-

ta‘cording to Schaetzel, is a ”nineteenth
century man, a Metternichian, a Bismar»
ckian,” who views diplomacy in terms of
bilateral detente.”

The Kissinger style of diplomacy is.

exerting a devisive force on the European
Community ta body of nine European
countries), says the former ambassador,
because the Secretary of State chooses to
deal only with major powers (Germany or
France), Schaetzel feels that Kissinger sees

the smaller European countries as client
‘ states, so that “their importance is

. they lean towards.” ‘

A divided Europe fits into the Kissinger
scheme much more than an united one, says

$ Schaetzel. it smaller countries are only
iclient states. Kissinger will be able to deal
with them individually, It smaller countries
have presented no fixed, general demands

or goals; Kissinger will be able to get a

greater aggregation of power by picking up
the pieces, A united Europe would provide a
block tn‘wards these aims. Schaetzel

maintains that ”a disunited Europe is
condemned to a state or impotence,“

kissinger has no faith in any sort of
unified Europe, says Schaetzel. because he

firmly believes in the prevalence of
nationalism. Kissinger Would also like to
check the strength at the European Com-
munity because he sees it becoming anti-
American in aims.

Schaetzel refutes these arguments “I‘m
optimistic because i believe you can change
things," Schaetzel says, “Nationalism is
essentially irrelevant in the twentieth
century.” He called the nationsstates u“.
stable, saying that countries consist mainlv
of “idiotic boundaries which grew out of
18th and 19th century empiricism.”

Directing his attention to the anti-
American charge, Schaetzel notes that the
US. has benefitted from the European
Community through the strong economic
growth of the latter. The Community has
contributed to a world economic order, says
Schaetzel.

Grave consequences are sighted by the
former ambassador for the smaller coun~
tries in a disunited Europe, He says, ”If
Europe is fragmented, small countries in a
world or superpowers will take themselves
out oi play." He cited the example of Nor-
way, which he finds to have taken an
irresponsible and isolationist position in
relation of its control over the North Sea oil.
Schaetzel also fears “Finlandization,” This
happens when smaller countries unguided
by a European commitment, are able to
wander off and gravitate to various big
powers. Finland is the prototype because it
Seems to maintain an outward autonomy,
but is internally controlled by the Soviets.
Schaetzel thinks that this is the most
dangerous form of control because it is

“American forces in Europe are the most
tangible evidence of American support in
Western Europe we can provide,“ Schaotzel
said in response to a question about NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organizationl,
“There is a very large Warsaw pact facing
the US, which is not a paper threat."
Schaetzel went on to say, “and it is partially
up to us to maintain stability," Schaetzel
feels that there is “the necessity of Europe
to feel that we are with them.” even though
he says us involvement in NATO really
only serves to further its own best interests,

“it wouldn't take a great deal which would
unravel the whole defense structure,"
Schaetzel cautioned. He feels that a future
reorganization of NATO should come. but
this is contingent on the occasion of an
economic upswing which probably will not
come until 1980. Schaetzel says that a
common European defense community
which shoulders its own burden will develop
as part of "irreversible momentum,"
although “an anachronistic rise of
nationalism and distrust of bureaucracy"
will have to be overcome.

Schacttcl calls the American bilateral
detente “no policy at all " He sees the
danger of Europe and America drifting
apart and antagonism setting in. Schaetzel
notes that because the 11.5. has been so well-
disposed toward Spain that the recent
Spanish upheavals have set European
American relations back farther.

“We need to have a strategic concept of
what sort of relationship we want to have
with Europe,” said the former ambassador,
during his second lecture. He suggests a
policy focusing on strengthening developing
countries, stressing cooperation with the
European Community, and seeking to find a

policy. But. Schaetzel cannot see any great,

improvement occuring before 1977.
