Cherry Orchard coming this weekend

Grinnell College Theater's pro-
duction of the Cherry Orchard takes
some serious risks, but it pays offin an
innovative production.

The back stage area is in full
view of the audience, according to
Brechtian principles. Thlsconstnnt-
ly reminds the audience that they are

rlaherery describes the theory be-
hind hayin eve thing in the open,
“In the wor d wc we in oiteleyision

A train runs across the front of
the stage as a symbolic deVice With
all these distractions the audience is
expected to really concentrate, to
work at watching the play and be«
coming involved. College theater is
the place to take risks, and director
Ellen Mease pulls it offwith an inno—
vative and inrcresiing play.

It was written fora theater group
in Russia that rejected the star sys-
tem ofdrama The cast isparticularly
suited to this type ofplay because the
current drama students are all yery
experienced in theater and have
worked with each other before Half

the Cast worked on The Medieval
Cycle plays last year and halfworked
on Much Ado About Nothing

Carolyn MacCulIough, Emily

Rachel Farris will play the lead role
of Lyubov. Nick Hartshotn is the
newcomer to the Grinnell stage. “A
lot of genuine connection and eye
contact and listening to the ether
actors" has occurred during the play,
according to Mease.

Cherry Orchard depicts the
change the industrial revolution
hmught to Russian society. An aris«
rocratic Russian falnily struggles to
deal With the loss of their beautiful
estate and cherry orchard as they
move into the new era “This is the
preeminent play otrnodcrn drama,”
explains Mease, The comedy is
often very difficult to grasp: Farris
said none ofthe cast understood the
humor until they read it aloud,

Real life iswhntCherry orchard
is about. Through the everyday in.
teractions between characters, Chek/
hov attempts to poke fun at who
people really are, Lopakin, Joe
Haynes, and Varya, Carolyn Mc«
Culloiigh, flirt With the idea of mar—
riage throughout the play Against
the backdrop of daily conversation
and events, a subtle interchange be—
tween Lopakin and varya displays
their love for each other. Lopakin
repeatedly attempts to propose to

Varya, but it dissolves into comedy
as he misquotes Shakespeare

Class interactions are addressed
in Cherry Orchard, for example in
the relationship between Lopakin
and Lynbov Lopakin struggles with
thc fact that his grandfather was a
serfwhile he is rich man. Chekhov’s
characters are all mostly good people
with a tragic flaw that ruins them,
Lyiibov is the oldest woman in the
rich family who is very kind and
loving. but she cannot accept that
she has become poor and keeps giy.
ing away the family's money.

The set is based on selective
realism. Accorrlingro Mease,selcc.
tiye realism "only indicates certain
elements of the environment while
asking the audience for a suspension
ofdisbelief." White drapes hung for
a nursery scene become the back»
drop for a projected landscape in a
forest scene Many elements of the
set are also very solid, like the door
frames. so characters can solidly in»
teract with them inorder to enhance
the illusion of the setting.

Period costumes were rented
from the Guthrie Theater in Minne—
apolis to help the actors and actress—
es concretely assume their roles.

The Cherry Orchardls not stan«
dard theater fate; it has a depth and
challenge that I found reireshing,

The Cherry Orchard plays Fri—
day, Saturday, and Sunday at Rob»
erts Theater.

Student modern art exhibit in Forum

ALLISON SHAW
STAFF WRITER

“TrueLove,"theartexhibitcur—
rently in the basement ofthe Forum,
has gotten a lot of strong reactions
from students, based on the com»
ments written in the exhibit's com-
ment book. Brandy Agerbeck, the
artist of “True Love”, says she in—

With;“sex."“romancc,”“beauty,”and
“love." Agerbeck believes that "a lot
ofpeoplcareworklng\Vltlisomepreb
ty warped definitions..." She cites
the example that simply going
through the rituals of givmg gifts of

candy and ﬂowers is considered a
sure sign of love by many people.
Agerbeck points out that such ac-
tions alone can mean nothing ifthe
feelings of really caring about the
person aren’tthere. The works inthe
first room of the exhibit are “more
sarcastic," according to Agerbeck,
while the second room has “more
personal" works, that are her reﬂec—
tions on the positive potential devel—
opment that telaiionships can
achieve.

In the first robeck’s “Love You,
Need You, Want You" is meant to
illustrate the one<sidedness of many
relationships, where each person is
just “greedy" for the other‘s atten—
tion. The babydolls‘ arms in the
work symbolize, for Agerbeck, the

helpless neediness that some people
affect in a relationship. “A lot of
people think love is what you get
from another person, but it’s just as
much about what you give.”

In the second room, Agetbeck’s
work “Altar" emphasizes the impor.
tance of giving your trust to your
partner and exposing your vulnera—
bilities. Agerbeck represents this
ideal with a sharp (and therefore
potentially painful) fragment of a
broken mirror labeled “honesty.”
Agerbeck says that “Altar" also (at—
geis the belief that each person has
one and only one utrue love," and
that if a person waits patiently
enough, fate will bring the two to-
gether. “False notions of fate and
romance don’t let [people] look hon»

Her work expresses the belief that
love is really more the process of
gradually opening up to the person
you care about.

Many of the means Agerbeck
uses for getting across her themes are
unconventional. The use of words is
especially unusual in visual art, and
has prompted some viewers to com»
plain that labels detract from the
artistic value/powet/visual impact of
the exhibit. But Agerbeck says “1
think [language] is a good tool. I like
to use words as a catalyst into what
Objects mean... Words are really ac<
cessible." She thinks that many peo—
ple are intimidated by modern art's
intentional vagueness, which can
exclude people unschooled in (tadh

To explain her motivation for
using the three—dimensional media
she chose, Agerbeck explains that
“painting is not necessarily the ideal
medium for all ideas." Agerbeck
likes people to be able to pick up her
work and examine it up close and at
different angles, to get a fuller expe-
