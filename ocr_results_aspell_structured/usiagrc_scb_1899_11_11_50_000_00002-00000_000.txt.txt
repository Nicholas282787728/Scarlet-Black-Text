orrnneu, suntan, My. 1.. rent We see men everywhere who think

they can go on committing mis~
Qﬁbitoriat deeds and then some time in the

future blot out all and be freed
WHATEVER THE outcome of the from the results. This very inis»

game with Iowa today, the team
must have the same loyal support
of the student body throughout
the remainder of the season. If
victory be ours. only one step for
ward has been taken for the state
championship, But should we
meet deteat. we must keep on and
work for the honorable position
of second placein the state. Next
Saturday’s game with Ames no
doubt will prove a hard proposi-
tion to solve. In the game last
week her team work, both offen-
sive and defensive, was equal to
if not superior to Grinnell's, and
only by a kicking game and poor
handling ot kicks on Ames' part
was Grinnell able to win. In the
cominggameshe will have the ad
ditional support of her large stun
dent-body and having had two
weeks to perfect her team play,
she may prove to be an altogether
more aggressive foe. It is hoped
that all who can will accompany
the team and aid them as much as
possible by their cheering. This
will be the most important game
of the remainder of the season.
and the distance not being great
a good rate will probably be ob—
tained.

Hi

Ex~Governor Altgeld.

Mr. Altgeld was greeted by a
good-sized audience in Rand gym-
nasium last night. Afterabrief
introduction by Dr. I-leiion, he
said that he had found it necessary
to change his subject and instead
or speaking on“The Political Phil-
osophy of Thomas Jefferson," as
was announced, he took as his
subject, "Moral Physiology.”

Mr. Altgeldsaid in part: "Our
physical body is governed bylaw.
So. too. our moral self is under
laws and when they are brolren
sure punishment follows. Not
only does man have to accept the
results of his ill deeds but also his
children must suffer with him.

 

conception is the cause of much
misery in the world. * * We
see whole families in misery and
destruction merely because they
are beneﬁciaries of a system which
allows the accumulation of tainted
dollars. * 4“ One of the sad
dest sights in this country is to
see young men with good parents
age, good advantages, good prose
pecls, come out into new environ-
ment and be utterly destroyed by
that environment. of all the
agencies that tend to destruction
those used by the lobbyist at the
capitals aretlie worst. The saloon,
gambling table and brothels are
used in the interest of the motion
polies which the lobbyists repre-
sent. 44: it We have just gone
throughaperiod of 30 years of
colorless politics, in which he was
the greatest politician who could
fool the people the best and se-
cure the most votes. during which
which time the parties considered
perfection in platform making
reached whcn evasion was secur-
ed. And looking back over that
30 years there is a great dearth of
great men. The world has found
that to develop the greatest men
and women, freedom, absolute
trcedom, is necessary, a it Soc
ciety has reached the stage where
great changes are to be made and
will be made. I believe that in
the next century this country will
move forward into a new career
just as a new career was given it
in the early part of this century.
But this will require great men;
earnest. thoughtful men. it it
It is not necessary to success that
inﬂuential people stand by you,
but success demands courage.
Greatness can be achieved only by
great ettoits. The men who have
helped the world have been those
who havc stood out in the open,
face to face with their God—they

are the men who have been the
world heroes."
