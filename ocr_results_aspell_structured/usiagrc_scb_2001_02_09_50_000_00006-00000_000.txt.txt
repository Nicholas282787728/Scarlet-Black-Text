F: Spike Leas latest joint features Damon
wayans as a Tv axoourivo who is forced to come
up with a new program idea. in an arrorr ro grr

he ran rhink or: a blackfacc minstre] show (think
Ted Danson). Hc gors a couple street porrorniors
to porrray lazy, shiirloss watermelon farmers, and
surprise: The show is a big hit. The setup should
be ramiliar in anyone who’s soon the Mel Brooks
classic “The Producers."

pretty damn good ﬁlmmaker (SlimmnofS/Im not—

provoke conversation abour the issues ir raises. How
whitewashed is network TV? And how favorably
are African-Americans porrrayed when rhsy are?
Also, its an interesting ﬁlm to are because u was
