A WONDERFUL SLANI’ on smoking! You’ll ﬁnd it in
the Droodle above, titled: Tourist enjoying better—
tasting Lucky Strike while leaning against tower of
Pisa. If your own inclination is toward better taste,
join the many college smokers who prefer Luckies.
From any angle, Luckies taste better. They taste
better, ﬁrst of all, because Lucky Strike means ﬁne
tobacco. Then that tobacco is M to taste better.
“It’s Toasted”7the famous Lucky Strike processi
