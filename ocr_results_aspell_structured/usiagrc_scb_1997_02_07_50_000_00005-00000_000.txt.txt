LETTERS

TO the editor

 

Many years ago, not long after I ar-
rived at Grinnell, I made a ﬁrm de-
cision never to write to the Scarlet
and Black. Whatever contretemps
occurred there I decided were better
left to the small coten'e of people who
found it an important fonim for their
ideas.

Now, at the end of my tenth year,
however, I find myself forced to
break my promise. The cause for my
speaking out is the deeply disturbr
ing letter that appeared in the S & B
of3l January. In this letter, 130 stue
dents called upon the administration
to refuse recognition to the
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.
This call, while it may be motivated
by an admirable desire to recognize
and reafﬁrm the rights of gay and
lesbian students at Grinnell, is none-
theless an expression of intolerance
that is irreconcilable with the prine
ciples ofliberal education.

One of the many admirable things
about Grinnell College is its dedicar
tion to the rights of the individuals
in its gay and lesbian community. In
our student activities and in our em-
ployment policy, we are truly fortue
nate. The kind of intolerance and big-
otry to which gays and lesbians are
often subjected in American society
is not a part ofthe College's policies.
In fact, the College is committed to
recognizing and defending the diver
sity of sexual preferences.

But how. I wonder, could a college
which maintains and protects the
rights of a minority that is often op-
pressed, and has often been silenced.
produce an appeal from its students
to silence and ban another unpopur
lar minority? While you may join
me in disagreeing with the way in
which the students in IVCF interpret
the Bible, I wonder how you could
conclude that this means that the
College should not recognize their
rights to free speech, freedom of as-

~ t, _,

(hue

sociation, and the freedom of reli-
gion. I can only conclude that you
have not thought through your posi
tion carefully and completely.

What is the position of IVCF?
What would it mean for the College
to deny them recognition? The
Fellowship's position is that leaders
in the group must accept an ”iner-
rant" interpretation of the Bible on
homosexuality. These passages in
the Old and New Testament say that
it is unlawful to engage in sexual acts
with members of the same sex and
the members of IVCF take them to
be literally, eternally true across all
cultures and time. Ido not agree with
this interpretation of the Bible any~
more than I agree that the passages
that endorse human slavery are cen-
tral to contemporary Christian faith,
But the fact remains that the passages
are there in the Bible and it is not an
unreasonable interpretation to say
that they are meant to guide the lives
ofChristians today. Thus, regardless
of how differently we may interpret
the Bible and how uncomfortable the
beliefs of IVCF leaders may make
us, we must accept that this is a
deeply held religious belief based on
their holy scripture.

And this means that to deny the
members of IVCF the right to assor
ciate freely as members of our coma
munity is to deny them their most
fundamental human rights. The
United Nations Charter on Human
Rights states that all people have the
right to religious freedom. Likewise,
the US. Constitution guarantees the
right to freedom of association. Is
Grinnell College above these basic
precepts of human r1 ghts and human
dignity? Should the College be the
only one in America that bans IVCF?
Are We such an intolerant commu»
nity that we cannot abide the reli»
gious beliefs of this minority? I
should hope not. Liberal education

cannot take place in an illiberal, in-
tolerant environment.

As I have reﬂected on the disturb»
ing message in the collective letter
of 31 January, and as I have tried to
imagine the best way to persuade you
that your position is wrong,'I have
been driven back many times upon
the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. Although Dr. King dealt
daily with bigotry, hatred, and vio—
lence, he always insisted that his
opponents be treated respectfully,
Do you remember that he insisted
that we never demonize our oppo-
nents? That we never de-humanize
our adversary? That, no matter how
wrong people are, we always treat
them With respect? Do you rememr
ber that he always insisted that we
allow our opponents the space to
back down and to change their posir
tion?

I ask each of you who signed the
letter calling on the administration to
ban IVCF from campus, to reﬂect
how well your position squares with
Dr. King’s,

But I ask you to do this not so much
because I expect that you will be
willing adherents to an abstract set
ofethical principles, but because Dr,
King's position was one of practical
urgency. He knew that laws alone
would not alleviate the racism hc

‘ foughtagainst. Thelaw,forinstance,

had not stopped lynching. What was
needed Was a change of heart on the
part ofthe people with whom he was
dealing. But it was equally clear to
him that this kind of fundamental
change would never come in a par
larized world in which he heaped
scorn on his opponents. To affect real
change, to make a real difference,
King realized that he had to show
respect for and work with his oppo-
nentsr

And likewise for each of you who
signed the letter. If you hope to make
a world that is safe for homosexu—
als, you will have to change hearts,
not just pass laws. The Christian
Right IS behind many of the ballot
movements in America to deny civil
rights to gays and lesbians. How can
you best address this situation? I
would like to argue that you can best

fromjust one of us, and then the next
week, the other will reply. The topic
for this week: Newt Gingrich's ethi~
cal dilemmas. '

As many of you have probably
heard, Newt has been fined $300,000
for ethics violations resulting from
his misuse of a “nonprofit" organir
zanon. It seems this organization,
which Ncwt founded, was researchr

in his book (which netted him around $420,000). Well,
nonproﬁt organizations are supposed to be politically
neutral, which this organization was not. As part of its
involvement Willi Newt’s teaching career (at a Georgia
university), the organization was researching material

or Sinn Fein).

We might be hearing
more about Newt
sometime soon.

Newt would use to support the infamous “ConuactW th

America". In other words, the organization existed to pro-
vide “intellectual" backing for Newt‘s political decisions
(a role similar to that of the American Tobacco Institute,

The long and the short ofit is, this ooh-profit (and,
thus, tax-exempt) organization existed primarily, if not
solely, to research propaganda for Newt and his campaign.

of inane bickering. This semester, however, we’ll be Back in the mitHiOs, a younger Newt Gingrich helped

Democrat) from office because of
anht's shady book dealings (which
netted him a‘ spartan $54,000, give
or take). I guess karma hasn‘t fore
gotten poor Newt.

Although much of the storm has
passed, Newt still has a chance to
prove he’s even more slimy than was
previously thought (although he did
negotiate a divorce with his ﬁrst wife

while she was under sedation following an operation...).
Newt has yet to decide how hc’ll pay the ﬁne. Should he
decide to take the money out of campaign funds, a stretch
of ethics at the very least, instead ofpaying them himself,
we might be hearing more about the Right Honorable
Gentleman from Georgia in the near future.

 

do it by treating people with respect
and civility, Trying to silence your
opponents, as a practical strategy, is
sclf~dcfeating. If the members of
IVCF-grhdualc from Grinnell and
become active in evangelical Chris-
tian communities around America.
what message would you like them
to carry With them about gays, lesbir
ans, and their allies? Would you like
them to say you are intolerant, scom-
ful, and bigoted? Or would you like
them to be able to say that you are
generous, compassionate people
whom they found to be pleasant to
work with despite your differences?
Do you want to foster tolerance or
intolerance? Do you want to further
the polarization in American politics,
or help to break it down? 'As you
reﬂect on these questions, do not for
get the fact that while Dr. King
helped lead us to better civil rights
laws in America, that his deeper
dream ofchanged hearts has still not
been completely realized.

I broke my promise to myself to
never write to the S 8c B because I
found your letter so disturbing and
because so many of you are people I

know well and respect highly. You
are my advisees, my students, and the
people with whom I enjoy sharing
the pursuit oflibcral education, But
I cannot talk with each of you one-
onrone; there is not time for that.
Thus, 1 am driven to addressing you
publicly. 1 hope that 1 can convince
you to change your mind. If I can
not, I hope you will understand that
I am trying to persuade you to change
your mind because I respect you and
share your dream of a better world.

Yours sincerely,

To the Editors of the
Scarlet and Black,

It has painfully been made aware to
us, The Men Who Stuff Their
Crotches, that the euphoria felt at the
beginning of a semester after a restr
ful, and rejuvenating break has worn
off. The almost orgasmic feeling of
freedom from labs, exams, and pa-
pers has become as distant a memory

Now, the burden oflabs, exams, and
papers creep ever closer giving us
much the same feeling of anxiety as
an upcoming prostate examination.
Yet. when it secms that the semester
will be nearly intolerable, a faint
glimmer grows stronger in the night
sky. That nostalgic light reminds one
ofa disco ball suspended in a fog of

fellow Grinnellians, to know that all
hope is not lost. Your spirits will be
