and his mrrsic again charmed all his
hearers. Professor Mallack, as direc
tor, instituted a' processional ior the
Vesper Choir, and this added coneide .
ably to the dignity and beauty oi the
service. The choir, in their vestinents.
made a good appearance and sang very
well, considering the iact that there
were many oi the old menihers miss-
ins. Tire heantiiul anthem ,'-o Glad

dered,

President Main gave a characteristi-
caily strong address on the text, “If

spirit which always iiiniiiicsts itscli in
his talks, The address made coin-
