New voting
rules enacted

By SOLOMON MILLER

For years, many Grinnell students have
been living in the mail room in IRC. At least,
that’s what they’ve been reporting on voter
registration cards.

A new procedure requires students to regs

' ister with their residential address—not their
mailing address—in order to vote in local,
state and national elections. This means that
students will have to ratrcgister each year or
whenever then move across campus.The new
policy responds to local Republican opposi-
tion to students' votes during the 2008 presi-
dential election.

In October of 2008, the co—chairs of the
Poweshiek County Republicans contested
the eligibility ofSO students who voted early
for the presidential election. The challenge
claimed that since the students did not all
live in the JRC, they were not properly reg-
istered to vote. But as Dean of Students Tra»
vis Greene
noted, nears
ly all college
h o u s i n g——
i n c lu d i n g
the entirety
of campus
and most

h o u s c s #
lies in the same ward as the JRC. There was
no confusion as to how the votes should have
been counted. An electoral committee afv
firmed all 50 votes.

Poweshiek County Auditor Diana Daw-
ley recommended the new, more precise
guidelines to ensure all eligible and inter
ested voters would have their vote counted.
Dawley is interpreting the law more strictly
than many others, according to Greene and
Co-Chait ofthe Campus Democrats Phillip
Sletten ’ll,who both worked with Dawley on
this issue. They believe this is to avoid any
future challenges to students’votes after what
hap ened in the ’08 elections.

0 this end, Student Affairs sent out an
all—campus e-mail before the recent cau—
cuses clarifying the rules and listing the
address of all dorms and college-owned
houses. According to Greene, a similar
e—mail will be sent before every election.

The next election is the Iowa primary in
June, in which Gov. Chet Culver (D) and
Sen. Charles Grassley (R) are each running
for re-election. Students will be able to vote
early, before the school year ends, according
to Sletten. Under Iowa law, voters can register
or update their registration on the day they
vote-Still, many students choose to register
early to avoid hassle on election day.

The Campus Democrats hope to regis-
ter as many students as possible. Despite the
group’s party affiliation, Sletten encourages
students with any political views to register.
He says the campus Democrats have regisr
tered Republicans and independents, as well
as Democrats. He hopes the extra paperwork
Will not decrease student voting.

“We know it’s tedious,” Sletten said, “We
don’t particularly like it either. But we want
to make sure that no challenges to your'vote
occur and that you can vote here in Iowa at
)1lilwllnt to.’

”We want [0 make sure no
challenges toy/our vote occur
and that you can vote in Iowa

ifyou want [0. ”

Student reps
eliminated
from CAS

By PETER SULLIVAN

The faculty of the college voted 40-32 on
Monday not to permanently add student members
to the Committee on Academic Smnding (CA5),
making it the only committee at the College with
a direct eECCt on individual students’lives that dots
not have student membership.

The committee deals with matters such as re—
adrnitting students who have been dismissed or
suspended from the College, approving exceptions
to graduation requirements and setting standards
for special course loads or absences.

However, under the proposal, students would
not have served on the subcommittee that rules on
the sensitive issue of plagiarism. The committee
also decides on iswee effem'ng the whole student
body, such as the academic calendar and Student
Handbook

“There are things that oorne up that are of a
highly sensitive nature,”said Joseph cummins,As
sociate Professor ofPhilosophy, who voted against
the proposal. “The students would actually be de
hbemdpg [on sensitive matters], not just having
access.

The facility vote comes after a year oflIial stu-
dent membership on the CAS and a unanimous
recommendation Earn the members of the come
mitteeY comprised of faculty and staﬂ, that studens
be added permanently.

The vote elicited strong feelings from students
involved with the proposal. “This is a dear indi-
cation the faculty have reservations about txusiing
students,"said Camila Barrios Camacho '12, one of
the trial student members ofrhe committee.

Student support for adding student members
to CAS came through a student initiative in the
fall of 2008 with 90 percent approval and a too
ommendation from SGA Joint Board. All of the
faculty and 5:35 members of the committee itself
also supported adding students. “It's good to have a
diversity ofviewpoins that help to have more bal—
ance,” said committee member and Chair of the
Faculty Mark Sdineider. ,

“The CA5 has a direct inﬂuence on studenm’
lives, so letting students be involved seems logical
to mufsaid SGA Vice President of Academic Af-
mus Joanna DeMars '10.

After Schneider oudinod the proposal before
the faculty in December, it was debated and voted
upon at the faculty meeting on Monday ‘Tanllty
didn't casually dismiss student concerns," Schr
neider said. “The discussion in the aculty meeting
was one of the most circuit thorough and mean-
ingnil dismions in a long time?

Studenu currently serve on other committees
that deal with similarly sensitive information, such
as the College Hearing Board, which disciplines
students for serious violations like sexual and phys-
ical assault.

However, Cumrnins’ main reason for voting
against the proposal to add studenﬁ to the CAS
did not have to do with privacy “VVe’ve set up shop
to give Bachelors Degrees,"Curnmins said. ‘We
give you the diploma and deﬂate to the world that
you have met the requiremenu, and”tliat‘s the fac-
ulty’s decision to decide that.”

Associate Dean of the College Kathleen Sheri
rett, who supported the proposal, wants students
to keep trying: “I know that after so much work
this outcome is deeply disappointing for many
suidcnrs," Sken‘ctt said We are educatuig you for
eidzenshlp. Lesson on: is; Pelsevere.”
