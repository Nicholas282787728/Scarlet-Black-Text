Further discussion of Mr. Daw-
son's proposal {or a new public
events program and discussion on a
statement from the Joint Board re-
garding the CBS Manifesto and re,
actions to it occupied most or Mon-
day’s meeting of the CofHP, AWS
Joint Board at 9:00 pm. in South
Lounge.

Mr. Dawson, Ed Levine, and Chip
Shoistall were present todiscuss
their ideas and feelings about Mr.
Dawson's proposal lor a new public
events program. The program would
set aside $15,000 {orthe contracting
or cultural events, such as theater,
ballet, and orchestra concerts, for
the rqrinnell College community.

Chip Shofstall, train the Initiative
Fund, teets that it is a good idea.
lt would result in bringing better
quality Cultural events to the college.
Ed Levine also feels that the idea is
a good one, but objects to the large
amount of money being taken from
the fund {or popular Concerts. Al-
though willing to give $1700 per
semester to the program, he feels
that $6500 per year is an excessive
amount and is Concerned about how
this large a cut would Iimittheahil-
ity ot the Social Coordinating Com
mittee to provide entertainment for
every weekend. The reply was that
it would not involve a decrease in
activities, rather a change in the
nature of activities available.

When asked how a $2500 decrease
would affect the program, Mr. Dawr
son replied that it would be an im-
provement over the present situa-
tion, but is still a large proportion
of the budget. He also added that
the decision is mainly a value judg
ment. As it stands, money allocated
for popular Concerts far exceeds that
allocated for cultural events The
change at funds would help balance
the proportions.

The general trend oittlediscussion
was that it is a good idea to offer a
diversity of entertainment on Grin-
campus. The major problem is the
amount of money to be taken from
the popular concert fund.

There was some discussion about
the problem of noise indormitories.
Sam Clemons mentioned Mr. Caul-
kins' survey in which 22 out of 47
students said they had had trouble
sleeping after 12:00 p.m. on week-
ends. Donna Rothenberg said that
this wasn’t really representative
and could be deceiving as a person
could reply it it had happened only
once or twice in over two months.

The problem at lining those stu-
dents who refuse to has their own
trays in Cowles was referred to the
Social Policies and Regulations

Telephone Service Restored

Telephone service was restored to
most college residence halls by 4.30
p.m, Sunday following the return of
about (93 transmitters and one ear
piece.

An anonymous telephone Call was
received at about 3 00 Sunday indi-
cating four locations where tales
phone parts might be lound. student
volunteers found the 83 transmitters
and one earpiece in two of the loca-
tions, one near the James l-lall Coke
machine in the South Campus loggia
and the other on the Sixth Avenue
staircase of the Fine Arts Building.

Two student volunteers installed
transmitters in all the damaged tele»
phones. They then turned in all re-
maining parts and a list oi phones
which were Still inoperable t0 the

yesterday.

charge ol eight lire extinguishers on
South Campus, gold paint splashed on
the outside at Darby gym and the
Ward field scoreboard, ropes cut on
the new nagpoles, and the breaking

at a parking regulation sign.

Several incidents of vandalism oc-
curred Tuesday and Wednesday

was some evidence that Grinnell

sible for the paint splashing, Hawn
added that Physical Plant staff, like
everyone else on the campus, was
increasingly aware at every small
bit of damage, and that some acts

On Freshman
Committee

by Anne Walter

The laculty meeting yesterday
afternoon had an aura oi unreality:
most 0! the laculty sat on the peri~
phery ol the room leaving the center

chairs empty; Clandestine conversa»
lion and bits of laughter occurred

throughout the meeting; there
seemed to be the realization of
greater pressures this week which
lent to the sense of absurdity this
afternoon.

Several important points were
made however. A motion was pre-
sented to make some changes in the
Freshman Year Committee, a
recommendation for an honorary de—
gree was made, and Shelley Floyd
made a plea for student opinion.

The Freshman Year Committee is
a faculty committee with several
student members that is designedto
make recommendations especially
concerning academics [or the fresh-
man program, The Dean oithe Col-
lege is designated as Chairman of
this Committee. The motion was
made and passed to make Mr. Clot—
felter, in his capacity as chairman
of the faculty, acting Chairman of
this committee, excepting the duties
or negotiating with department
chairmen and budgetary matters
while Dean Wall is On sabbatical
next semester.

Several additions to the member»
ship were proposed but action was
not taken due to the lack ofa quo-
rum. It was suggested that Jim Te-
derman, assistant dean at student
affairs, and two additional students
(one freshman and one black) be
made members of the committee.
Shelley Floyd was asked to give an
opinion on these recommendations
and surprised the faculty by blurte
ing out, instead, her discontent at
not being lniormed prior to meet-
ings of those things on which the
taculty wants student opinion. she,
felt that the off-hand manner in
which shevis usually asked to give an
opinion was indicative oiinsincerity
on the part of the faculty in their
desire to take student opinion into
account. It is impossible {or her to
assess student opinion on many
issues ii she is not informed prior
to the meeting.

Mr. Robert Wilson Crawford who
is well-known for his work in rat:-
reation in innerrclty areas has been
recommended by the taeulty to the
trustees to speak and receive an
honorary degree at the lormal cone
vocation of the new P. E. complex.
This convocation will occur during
the alumni week-end, the weekaiter
commencement this spring. Mr.
Crawlnrd, pending trustee approval,
is to be invited to give the principal
address at this convocation,

There are several important
issues to be presented to the faculty
at a special meeting this Thursday.
The results of the negotiations With
CBS will be presented at this time.
Mr, Walker may ask {or discussion
on both the budget and admissions at
this meeting,
