'The Signers'--l943 - -

The whole question of racial prejudice and
intolerance has been filtering through the
Grinnell intellectual atmosphere for the
past two years, now rising to prominence
over sonle particular incident or outside
stimulus, and again fading from the dis
cussion and apparently the thought of tile
students for weeks at a time. Some stue
dents have been particularly interested in
the problem, and have devoted conscien-
tious efforts to ameliorating it. Their sin-
cerity is to be no less praised than their
high aims.

However, in a recent skirmish with per-
sons officially connected with the prosecm
tion of an American soldier, in whose trial
the negro question entered to some degree,
not ollly the Grinnell students who have
espoused the cause of racial equality, but
similar students and civilian adults all over
the country, haVe had a certain lesson
pointed out to them clearly.

The first point, which is implicit in a
letter recently received from MaJ,—Gen. J.
A. Ulio, adjutant general of the United
States, and addressed to the signers of a
recent petition of Grinnell students, is,
briefly: MAKE SURE OF YOUR FACTS
BEFORE YOU PETITION, COMPLAIN,
STRIKE, DEMAND, GRIPE, OR JUST
GENERALLY BLOW YOUR TOP.

Ulio’s letter was concerned with the
court martial of Sgt. Alton L. Levy, the
decision of which was protested by many
Americans as unnecessarily severe, and
this severity further being decried as a
direct punishment for Levy's sympathetic
defense of several negro soldiers during ale
tercations with an M. P

An excerpt from the general’s letter is
pertinent. »” . It is apparent that he
(Levy) was not charged with or convicted
of intervening in the behalf of . . . colored
soldiers and the prosecution offered no
evidence whatsoever in this regard. He was
convicted of wilfully and maliciously mak-
ing false and highly derogatory statements
relative to the Commanding General of the
post and his immediate family."

We think the adjutant general of the
United States is smart enough to stick to
veritable facts in a letter which has been
sent under his signature to numerous
groups similar to the Grinnell petitioners.
If he has not, then all such petitioners have 1

 

a case. But it certainly would have been
wiser of them to have uncovered ally pos—
itlie evidence of prejudice prior to ch
pending energy and postage on petitions.
So the second lesson is equally clear:
ill this, as in all really important matters.
make haste slowly. That is not rationaL
iz‘tioll, it is comlnonlsense. The problem
of racial pr judice has been long ill ac
cunlulating; its solution cannot come swift—
ly with the glamour and effectiveness of
an electric shot: Its roots are deep in the
social, economic and cultural patterns of
the ages, and its solution must be ‘radical’
ollly ill the true meaning of the word.
Prejudices are fearful only if they are
deep prejudices. Tolerance is . admirable
only ii l is equally deep. This is no job of
‘l'efinishing’ia quick dab of shellac and a
hopeful prayer. This is a job of ‘rehuild
ing’—a strong foundation, good blue prints,
alld skillful, workmen.
If it is up to us to hand you a bitter pill,
we do so without apologies. Swallow it,
dislike it if you
that uol i, not uolds, is the plescliption.
And what do you suggest as \ViOllc
First, the finding of the facts. Second, the
living of an example of tolerance. Third,
the willingness to try and fail and try and
fail and try and fail again, but not to stop.
If the case of Sgt. Levy—in prompting
petitions which ill turn prompt letters from
the adjutant general, which ill tul'll per
haps teach a very few a very little about
fighting for causesithen, consciously or
unconsciously that Sgt. Levy shall have

added a great deal to the cause we likei

to think he espoused. It is not a small
reward,

it the Shoe Fi’rs - -

Attendance (or lack of it) at chapel and
college church is a trite subject. We get
tired of hearing about it, perhaps, in spite
of the fact that we admit it should be
much better. However, we feel the situa
tion is more than adequately worthy of
comment at this time. ,

D1. Edward A. Steiner is a great man,
a great philosopher, and 21 great teacher.
He has done as much for this institution

ill his long years of devoted service here‘

as any other one man who comes to our
minds, Yet when this man speaks in the
pulpit on our own campus, those in at-
tendance consist of something over 100
students, three scattered faculty members
and a few townspeople.

True, the only students now on campusl
who knew Dr.

Steine' personally are the
seniors, since he retired from academic
participation in Grinnell activities three
years ago. But his reputation has traveled
far and lives in the hearts of those seniors
to remind others of his superb qualities.
This man’s interest in us, in the whole of

Grinnell, is still very much in evidence,

Why should our interest and appreciation'

in him wane?

The academic and social gains available
at Grinnell are forever stressed. Perhaps
not enough emphasis is placed on the value
of philosophical and spiritual learning of-
fered by such Grinnell men as Dr Steiner.
He had a distinctly worthwhile message to
deliver to Grinnellians Sunday It is too
bad that mole will not be able to profit
by it.
