ICICLE
By Nlidft Matltgiatolli

Melting. li-eoznig. layer upon layer,
Dripping glistening, iii the colrl, hard sun,
The tooth ot some lontastie glueialhenst
Solivnting:

Longer and longer the sober grows

To hideous lengths ot untnnied beauty.

stepping. shivering on the puck-marked snow
Blouing on hands still with cold,

The knight druii-s his pick

And strikes,

Strikes again and Aglull

Unttl the tusk shutters

On the snon lies the beast.
0n the snow, vunquisheit lieouty
In at dozen shurprdged splinters or gloss

And the hinguoni is saved,

FARM
tiy Alan Bensley

Sunsstl‘uck barn
painted white

empty with dust

and old hay dark

with closed doors,

the big maple broken
by the wind,

the walnuts broken

hy the saw

when the old man
planted ll‘

in his mind

corn and beans
nowadays

he just slamlners a lot
about the prairie tires
ﬁfty years ago In North Dakota.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON,
SUNDAY MORNING

by Al Hammond

Too many people signal
not enough room to ride.
No one likes to share themselves
not enough room to hide,

Staring out upon the world
wondering where to go

Day mid night running troin ourselves
Ain't got time to grow,

Listen people listen
to what l'ni trying to say

Don’t you know that love can come
only it it mayt

Mutllel‘s and you fathers

don't you know the score?

Con you hear your children cry,
open up the door0

storing up into the sky
wondering where to go. V

Day and night the same old thing
Ain't got time to know.

Listen people listen
can’t you hear their plans?
Come on out Ironi in yourselves
listen to your dreams!

Too many people seeing

what they want to see.

Never hearing what's been said
ignoring you and me

staring out from in ourselves
wondering whether to love.

Day and night the same old thing
Too otruiu to love

Listen people listen I

can't you hear your screams?
Come on out [rpm in yourselves
Listen to your dreams!
