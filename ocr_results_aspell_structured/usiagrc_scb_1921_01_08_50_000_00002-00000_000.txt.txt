The statement of Ii. 5. McGowan,»
head or the local Gi-inziell Movement-

ofilce, to the elfect that the newly
aroused student activities in canal:
of the endowment drive have greatly
encouraged aluniiii workers in their
efforts, bears out the predictions cur-
rent on the campus that the state in

After all, it is the student body that‘

college.
the past. few years. Statistics from
other colleges, in their attempts to
raise money have shown that student
contributions, both in money and
work, have been important inlluenccs
in the drives. It the students show
enough loyalty towords their college
to sacriﬁce a. bit, outsiders will he-

llﬂ‘o that the school that on inspire'

what the drive is tar, and although
enthusiasm and support, in the ideal-

not be cashed into the actual silvor
needed to carry on the work.

"Importance of Being Earnest”
Chosen for Endowment Bene<
ﬁt Production.

Aegitrloniun play, “The importance
or Being Ernest”, and is working

Iovei-tiiuc to perfect the production of

rccently in the
French farce. “Lo Cuvicr", has been
given the part or chudolino Brack—
nail, the leading feminine rule,
ver Sherman, as the Hon. John
Worthirig, plays opposite Miss Cham-
berlaln. Another diuicult character
to portray is that of Lady Bracknell,
which is talrca hy Lillian North, and
still another is that or Algernon Mona
crierl. to be played by Oliver Dillon.

"The Importance of Being Ernest”
is a delightful English three-act furor
comedy by Oscar Wilde. The settiny
is in London “high” society and the
produced
tile tangle ensuing lrom two diffe
ellt characters trying to be Ernest
no less than a ruirtli quake. The
play abounds in genuine humor thru-
out Ilnderiztld with a satire as subtle
Its almost to escape onu’s attention.
It is to be presented at the Colonial
theater Jan, 22, the proceeds to be
turned over to the Student Elldolvs
liient Campaign Fund.
