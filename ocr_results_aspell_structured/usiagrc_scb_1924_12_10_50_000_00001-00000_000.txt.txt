Following the snnuol custom of

,teﬁms are alwcys bord ‘iD pick, so "Ll
little different plan is followed in
choosing theabovc teams. A compos-
ite choice was made of the teams
Picked by the leading sport writers in
the valley, McBride of the Kansas Clty
Star, Ccchrane of the Kansas City
JourhaLPust, Boelter of the Des
Moines Capitol, and Sec Taylor of the
Des lifoines Register. .

In picking the teams, ﬁve points
were given when a man was placed on
a first team, four points for second
team mention, three for third, and one
for honorable mention. in cases where
the writer did notpick a third team,
two points was given for honorable
mention. .

Several Chosen Unanimously

several men received unanimous
choice for their respective positions,
These included Munn of the Kansas
Aggles at end, Weir of Nebraska, and
Smith of Kansas at tackles, Smith of
Missouri at center, Oreblugh of Drake
at quarterback, and Rhodes of Nebras»
k3 at halfback, While Bristow of Okla-
homa. was placed at fullback on every
team except Eoeltel-‘S, and received
nineteen points out of a possible twen-
ty. Orcbaugh of Drake was placed on
the first team by each writer, although
Eoelter put him it halfback, and gave
the quarterback position to J. Behm of
Ames.

Both Cochrane and McBride put
Duke at guard despite the fact that the
Pioneer star has plsyed tackle all sea.
son. Their argument was that Duke
was too good a man to keep off the
ﬁrst team, but not quite as good a
tackle as either Wcir or Smith, In
the other two selections, Duke was
picced on the second team at tackle,
so he received eighteen points out of
a possible twenty.

Competition for the places on the
teams was keen even in this method of
a composite choice. Sloan and Lingcu—
feltcr of brake tied with eighteen
points, but the'latter was given the
ﬁrst team position over his teammate
because of the fact that he was placed
on Eckersall’s All-Western team,
ahead of Sloan. Longstrcet of Ames
was just one point ‘bchind Hutchinson
of Nebraska in the contest for second
team center, and Sweet, and Moran,
the Grinnell backfield starswero each
just one point behind the men who
were placed in the Same positions on

Pioneers Recognized

That the trains in the conforcuce

The first games of the class series
were played this afternoon, the
Senior defeating the brush 16 to 12,
and the Juniors winning over the Sopr
homores, 12 lo 6. The games were
evenly battled and although marred
by the lack of team work and ability
to handle the hell, they were well
playod.

In the first game the Freshmen
stepped out and took an early lead
which by consistent fighting they held
until the middle of the second half.
Critchctt, fax-varsity player was then
inserted in the linup and showed up
in old time form putting in three pret-

gave the seniors the lead, After
that they were never bended until the
game ,ended, Seniors 16, Freshmen 12.
Critchett, Taylor, and June, bore the
brunt of the offense for the Seniors,
while Davis, Lustfield, and Smily were
the stellar performers for the frosh.

Presents Difficult Subjoct in
Third Lecture.

Professor Birkhoff, the distinguish»
ed Harvard mathematician, chose
”Cruvity” us the subject for his chapel
lecture Tuesday morning. The sub-
ject was, in his own words, “not an
easy one to present, although the phe-
nomena oi grovitutions are with us
all the time."

Howcvcr, the success of his treat-
ment of this difficult subject was at-
tested by the close attention the ﬂuids
icuce gave to his words and by the in~
tercst shown in the exhibit afterwards.
On being asked by one of a group of
admirers how he was able to make
such a technical subject of interest to
a group of liberal arts students, Mr.
Eirkhoff replied,

"1 have really put a. great deal of
thought upon this subject. Hours of
thought, like footrpoulids of energy,
give results. And after all, the most
complicated theories in the universe
ore fundamentally but combinations of
very simple laws."

Subject Well Handled

The exchange lecturer put his ma-
ter-fol across to the audience by relat-
ing his subject to the things of every»
He constantly made refer—
ence to such things as elevators, hase~
balls, mcrl‘yrgo—l'ounds, penny scales
and pocket wcbches, which he defined
as uosciluting elastic bodies."

He began his discussion by stating
the idea which most of us hold con~
cerning gravity; that it is a. force
which pulls bodies towards the earth.
Then, tukiug up the sncient
discovery that bodies distant from
each other proceed in straight lines,
and that those in prox mity travel in
curved lines, Professor Birkhaff de-
clared that the measuring of force

'lleélli. with geomotly.

“The measure of a man’s greatness
in the Scientific world," he declared.
while speaking of Newton, “may he
determined by figuling how long afiel-

his death it would have been befure'

some one else would have mndo the
sama discoveries."

Two scientific
were discussed by the lecturer, the
complete, as exemplified in the mo-

llecular action explanation of heat, and

he incomplete, or acceptance of a
“few simple principles, the latter be-
ing the one used in a consideration of
gravity. He also spoke of the princi-
ple of sufficient reason and of HS beltrr
ing upon physics.

Newloniuu Theory Discussed

His discussion of the
theory of gravitation was replete with
illustrations This theory, he ex-
plained, was the only possible one that
could meet all. the elementary Candi»
ticus of gravity, although there were
certain inherent imperfections. The
l'epugnance of nature to allow any ob-
ject to travel with a speed greater
tahu that of light was n fact which the
Newtonian theory Ruled to recognize.

“Theoretically," he said, "there is on
absolute (line and space, But, as. a
matter of fact, neither the ruler with
which we measure distance, nor the
clock With which We measure Space,
is absolute in its cnlculutions. Yet,
two objects in space and timo will re—
act to their environments. We may
conclude, that gravitation in its simp-
lest woy, is mutual influence. It is a
kind of cosmic effect of fitting togeth~
er various lines of force which ore
straight where matter is, and curved
whore matter is not."
