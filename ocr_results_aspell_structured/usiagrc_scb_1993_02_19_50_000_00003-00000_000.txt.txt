BOB’S from page 2

broughtthcdefieituptoover$1,300.
Thisadditionalblow,iswhatbrought
Bob‘s to the dangerous positiott
where it stands now.

Johnsonexpresscdhisdcepcon-
cern about the situation and coin
merited that so far [this semesterl
things seem to be going well. Re-
garding the new smoking policy, he
said that “it hasn’t hurt [Bob’s] yet,
but it might be too early to judge."
He added that if the future proved II.
necessary, Bob's might return to the
old policy. To the question if he
thinks that Bob‘s deficit could be
covered by the end of this semester,
he answered negatively.

The way things are now, and all
factors taken into consideration, it
seems that Bob’s Underground is
bleeding heavily and the only hope
for its survival lies in the measures
that are currentlyiwith the anticir
pated adjustment of the menuibe-
ing concluded. If the coffeehouse
doesn’t yield a profit soon, it will
have to be closed down.

Judging that the cause of the
coffeehouse is very importantto the
campus community, and choosing
not to point any fingers concerning
responsibilities for the mistakes
made so far, Johnson concluded his
brief explanation of the situation
commenting, “My personal goal for
this semester is to make this place
turn out a profit."

African position in post-Cold War
world discussed by Dr. Ali Mazrui

By Amy Anderson

most distinguished scholar in Af

rican politics in the world,” Dr.
Ali Mazrui spoke Tuesday on
Africa’s position in postrcold War
politics.

The main focus of his Speech
was to wonder if a ”global apart-
heid” was Hiking place among the
white nations of the world. He felt
this was occurring in two ways: the
“microretribulation” of eastern Eu7
rope, as seen in ethnic struggles in
the former USSR and Yugoslavia,
and the “macroretribulatton” of west

Phoebe Juel to appear

I-IE answer is: “Phoebe Juel."
T Who is the Grinnell College

student at this year’s college
Jeopardy! tournament?

Phoebe Jucl, erstwhile Texas
A&M student, new a junior history
major atGrinnell, will enjoy four days
in southern California as a contestant

ern Europe, whose “Pan-
Europeanism led them to regard
themselves more European than
ever." This trend, Mazrui feared,
would “lead to a form of division
between the rich, white world and
the povertyrstrickcn, fragmented
black world.”

Mazrui, director ofGlobal Cul-
tural Studies at SUNY, pointed out
other problems for Africa, listing
“benevolent" and “malignant” rae»
ism and the “marginalization of Af-
rican states in global system at pre-
cisely the time when democratic
forces are beginning to have imr
pact." He pointed out declining per»
centages of African nations in the

Becoming a contestant on Jeop-
ardy is unquestionably difﬁcult, First,
potential contestants have to be se

United Nations because ofthe disin-
tegration of larger nations into
smaller ones, such as the USSR.
ASpartoftlmulli»nalionalc0m-
mittee to establish reparations for
Africans, Mazrui discussed the idea
of compensation for repressed na-
tionalities.Hestatedthatwhileothcr
abused ethnic minorities have been
compensated in the past. “the idea
gets laughed out of court" for Afri»
cansThemainobjectiveforhiscom-
mittee was to ”convince the rest of
the world" when Africans them-
selves don’t believe in reparations.
However, Mazrui stressed that “we
should think beyond money," and
work for structural changes, such as

on TV’s “Jeopardy

she mailed only 35.

Juel’s parents own a flower shop
in Sylva,NC, which is not farfrom the
Great Smoky Mountains National
Park. Juel said she transferred to Grin-
nell because she wanted to attend a
smaller school and because she has

giving the Security Council veto to
groups of African nations, rational-
izing that the “veto of the relatively
powerless makes them important
people to cultivate."

Ending his speech on a positive
note. the scholar gave examples of
the “moral strains of Africa that could
be tapped." He used as examples
the racial, religious, and ethnic dir
versity of the wives of African presi-
dents, and the Africans’ “short
memory of hate," seen through
NelsonMandelaandthepostrBiafran
War Nigerians. In explanation of
this moral thread, Mazrui simply
stated, “maybe mere‘s just some-
thing African about it.”
