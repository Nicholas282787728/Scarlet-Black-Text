STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGA President Discusses-
Changes to Constitution

Last semester. Joint Board
passed a by-law change that made
two of the cabinet positions, the
Special Events Coordinator (SEC)
and the assistant SEC, staggered,
one-year positions. That is to say.
the Assistant SEC for one semester
automaticaltybecomestheSECthe
following semester. What all this
boils down to is that Deb Koa and I
are now looking for someone to be
next semester’s Assistant SEC.
Applicationscanbepickedupfrom
the table just inside the SGA offic-
es. and will be due 5 p.m.
Wednesday, Nov. 2i (the day be
fore Thanksgiving).

What is the SEC? As I men
tioned above, the SEC is a cabinet
position. S/he receives a salary of
$225 as Assistant SEC and $250
the following semester as SEC.
Dunes entail, among other things.
organizing the waltzos. blood
drives, refrigerator rentals. SGA
book sales; facilitating furniture
Slomge, attending the weekly (:1le
inet meeting, attending every Jomt

Board meeting. chairing Special
Events Committee and holding a
minimum of four office hours a
Week. interviews will begin
sometimeafterThanksgivingbreak.
Consider it.

so». will be proposing several
changes in our constitution by the
end of this semester, Some of the
changesinvolvere-inserting provi~
sions that were somehow omitted (I
assume accidentally) when the
constitution was revised in I988.
For example, currently there IS no
explicitconstitutionalprovisionfor
impeaching Joint Board Senators.
Other changes will involve writing
in specificjob duties for the Sena-
tors. including designating specific
times when minutes should be
posted. mandating that Senators
sponsor at least one all-donn study
break per semester and mandating
that senators distribute evaluation
forms similar to the ones that Stu»
dent Advisors, Hall Activities Co»
ordinators and Resident Advisors
have to distribute.

Fernandez-
McCarthy

While we are considering the
constitution, we will propose a
number of changes that will clean
up any inconsistencies currently
found in it. TWOrthirtIS of Joint
Board has to petition any amend-
mean to the constitution. which
must then be ratified by 60 percent
of the students voting in an allr
campus referendum; it must then
receive President Drake’s approv-
al. lfJoint Board does petition for
such a change, we will keep two
copies of the proposal on reserve in
Burling;werllalsohavecoplesof
the proposed changes in the SGA
offices for students to look over.

RANDOM MUSINGS
Indonesian Theft Teaches Student Abroad Valuable LesSo'n

During the ride to my internship
this morning, Madonna's “Like a
Prayer" was playing on the radio, a
songlheardnumeroustimesduring
my summerinlntlonesia. Itbrought
back many memories, of people I
knew, of settin gs. even of particular
situations. And this morning. as
sometimes happens when I see or
hear or taste something which
reminds me of indonesia, I just
wanted to drop everything and go
back. to be with old friends and
enjoy old times.

I realize these memories are
selective, for they exclude the bad
times. When everything seemed to
go wrong. I was completely
frusoated and l behaved terribly,
like the proverbial “ethnocenm't:
on vacation.”

Mysecond triptolndonesia was
undoubtedly the worst; sometimes
it is difficult for me to believe that
I behaved the way I did. I think
therewerefactorswhichcontributed
to my generally negative and self-
cenlered perspective.

The Maiang program was new.
the director was inexperienced and
had brought her two~year old child
intow,andnoneoftheotherstudents
had any experience in Indonesia.
There were no library resources to
speak of (except for a couple of
English books in the university
libraries with obscure publisher’s
names in Hong Kong and titles like
”Tips forPermlngYourHair”),and
the seven American students were
frustrated by the strict lecture style
of the Indonesian instructors.

Combined with this was the
reticence of Indonesian students to
approach us, except ones who
wanted to study English or the ones
who asked us if we had any
pornography on us. We spent all
ourtimetogethermurfavoritesocial
activitybecamcgathcringasa group
in a restaurant and complaining.
swapping our frustrationsaboutthe
university, our host families, food.
even about how the rickshaw drivers
were always trying to dupe us. in
this smothering, stifling situation.
our petty concerns were
compounded until they dominated
our daily lives.

In' the middle of the program. it
was my birthday, and on that day I
received a notice that there was a
package for me at the city post
office. Iran down thereand received

were three shirts inside and candy,

until a week later when my friend
called to ask me if I liked my
presents and ifI was wearing my
Ray Bans. WHERE WERE MY

innumerable trips to the post office,

awful tragedy that had befallen me.
During this same period there was
another development; my parents
sentme a money order for $300 to

delivery of this letter became an

sometimes three daily visits to the

You. the hapless reader, may
wonder why this column is headed
by question marks. It is because I
have failed to come up with a title

I thought the Scariel and Black

serious, so i decided I’d follow my
long-domant journalistic instincts
and uy to write a column that had
