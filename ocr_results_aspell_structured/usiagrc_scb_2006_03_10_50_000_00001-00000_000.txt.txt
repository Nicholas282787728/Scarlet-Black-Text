Relating race and religion

"Segue” series of events sponsored by Grinnell College Christian Fellowship
(GCCF) explores "racial reconciliation” through the lens of Christianity

isv Jose SEGEBRE—SALAZAR

On Tuesday night in the Forum South Lounge about 30 stu-
dents stood up and clapped to the rhythm ofa Nigerian song that
translates to “My Lord is Good."1t was the opening song for Mule
ticultural Worship Night, the second event of the nine day program
segue, sponsored by the Grinnell college Chrsitian Fellowship
(GCCF). The night moved from rhythms from Africa, through
songs in Spanish to traditional Christian songs in English.

(3ch held Eagle to draw attention to issues of race from a
rehgious perspective The orgnizers of this year’s Segre are Goad,
Derek Bates ’08, Lindsay Young ’08 and Brian Smith ’09.The goal is
to make Segue a recurring event to deal with what the organizers say
is an important socialjustice issue.The Segue organizers tried to his
corporate as many cultures, races, and cthnicities into their events.

“[Segue takes] a social issue that is contemporary in our society
and [asks] how does Christianity in some way line up with us,"said
one of the organizers Michele Goad'07.

“Segue is trying to start a tradition," said Smith. “We are trying
to make it so that we can bring a pertinent socialjustice issue before
campus every year.”

After the singing in Multicultural Worship Night, the event
moved to a sermon on The
Book of Galatians. Tim
Lynn '03 equated the i u-
diazcrs" preaching of a per-
verted gospel where the gm,
tiles must be circumcised
before joining a church to
contemporary racial segr
regation, especially church
segregation, He linked the
Judiaacr‘s discrimination of
people wlth foreskin, to the
discrimination ofpeoplc ofdrfferent races.

Segue opened Monday night with the movie Kerimnbcv I/Je To
mm and then attempted a racial analysis of the movie,

”Segue is trying to start a nadi-
u‘an. We are trying to make il so
that we can bring a pernneni
SOfia/jLISl/(e issue before the
campus even/year”

Brian Smith ’09

Segue also tried to encourage discussion of racial Issues and
awareness through an exhibit in the Forum South Lounge. “Facing
Race: A Series oflnteractive Events”was on display both Wednesday
and Thursday. The exhibit consisted of quotes iiom people such as
Colin Powell and Muhnmr
mad Ali and related passages
from the Bible. People were
able to write their reaction
to quotes on the walls. They
also had a place were people
could express themselves
through art. A video dealt
with perspectives on race in
the campus, an Implicit Ass

”[Segue takes] a sacral iSSllE that
is contemporary in auriaciery

in same way line up?”

sociation Test and a survey.

The survey presented the audience with statements such as ”Rae
cial injustice is a sing against God." Those surveyed had to paste
a sticker on a spectrum with agree and disagree on the ends and
neutral in the middle.

The events climaxed with the two keynote addresses from speaks
ers Peter S joblom and Derrick Rollerson. Their talk on Wednesday
night, titled “Ann I My Brother’s I(eeper.>"was aimed at a less Christ
tian dominated audience and was signiﬁcantly less “Christianizmg”
than the talk they offered onThursday, according to one of the event
hosts.The Thursday talk “Lot God be Freci"was aimed primarily at
a Christian audience.

Both Sjoblom and Rollerson work for Chicago Urban Recon-
ciliution Enterprise (CURE). They have been giving talks for the
past 25 yearsThe two difrercnt talks were segues way ofappealtng
a bigger crowd though rho majority ofparticipants in all the events
weie Christians.

segues final event is todav at 9 pm in Bob’s Underground Cafe.
This last event, entitled “Living in Color: ATime for Sharing and
Reflection,” wraps up segues week of racial reconciliation and jus~
rice.

Hall, Billups
look forward

After week of campaigning and
runoffs the new SGA president-
and vice president-elect say
they want to focus on reform

sir MERRICK MEYERS

Emerging victorious in last Friday's tunsoffelcc-
tion, Chris Hall ’07 will be the next SGA President,
and Michael Billups ’07 will become Vice President
and President ofAcadeinic Afrilll’Ss

Hall has known since last year that he wanted to
make a run for SGA Piesideiit, holding off fiom runv
rting then because he was going abroad. Billups, after
weeks of deliberation, only made his final decision
two days before the deadline for candidacy.

Hall recruited friends to help him get the word
out, whereas Billups’campaign was a onerman opera
tion. Besides the statements of intent, which Billups
calls the most significant part of the process, and two
omeial open torums attended by five of the seven
candidates, the
candidates used
word of mouth,
campaigning in
the dining hall
lobbies, and the
posting ﬂiers.
Hall and his
friends spent
hours putting
up hundreds of
fliers with his
statement of intent across campus

Towards the end of the campaign, Hall found
himself staying up until three or four putting up post-
crs, and at one point was forced to skip an under
standing professor's seminar. “I’m just happy I get to
sleep now," Hall Smd.

With campaigning and the election behind them,
the two now hope to focus on the issues that brought
them to SGA. “It’s an interesting era to be an SGA
official," said Billups. He and Hall point to numerous
issues that will face the student government next year,-
such as the problem of date-rape drugs and other iSr
sues of safety and security, effective communications
between the student body and the faculty and the Ext
panded Knowledge Initiative.

Both cite the campus center currently under Corr
structron as one ofthe most important issues for SGA
in the coming year. “There's going to be all sorts of
issues with the new campus center that come up that
really are urrroresecabic right now," said Hall. “Stu-
dent input will have great impact on than"

Billups stressed the importance of reforming ins
stitutions including the Judicial Council. “I think that
we can preserve the confidentiality of those that come
before JudCo, but at the same time it’s important that
the campus be aware of how policies that are hidden
away in that campus handbook are enforced"

The pair may become a triumvirnte With the pro-
posed SGA refoim that would add a second Vice
President, a President ofStudent Affairs, to lessen the
President's workload. Hall is in tarot of the proposal.
Billups agrees that some type ofreform of the SGA
Constitution is necessary but is yet undecided about
the precise form it should take

“I [want to be] the guy that actually gave a crap
abourwhat the people were concerned with and actu-
aLly tried to make a difference." said Billups.

Hall had similar goals. “I want to make surc
llic student body is aware of things we’rc trying to

Election, cont. p.2

”/ want to make sure the student
body is aware off/rings we’re
trying la achieve and also aware
afme piagies; we make.”
