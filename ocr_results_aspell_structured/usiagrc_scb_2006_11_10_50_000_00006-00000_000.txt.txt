through the years

BY CHARLIE WHITE

For many bigrciry kids, attending Grinnell
comes with sacrifices. New Yorkers might miss
the gourmet food and hipster nightclubs, Cali-
fornians might miss the beach. But they quick-
ly learn that one big part of city life doesn't
have to end—raucous, rotltin concerts nearly
every weekend.

For years, Grinnell has attraered ralenred
bands to play for audiences a fraction of the
size many ofthei-l-i are used to.Within the last
several years, Grinnell has hosted Cutsive,The
Decemberists, Ted Leo, Cake, Le Tigre and
Built to Spill,just to name a few. What attracts
these bands to a town of 10,000, an hour from
anyrhing that could be called a tiry.> Accord-
ing to current SGA concerts chair Mike Van
Hulle '07, it’s mostly rhe money and a little bit
of luck. -

"We have had a very large budger com
pared to other schools," he said. “We can give
bands the money they want to play a show."

However, it doesn’t always take a lot of
money to book good bandsThe Decembetists,
who recently Signed to the major record label
Atlantic, came twice during the Spring ’04 se-
mester for a very small fee. “That was just a
case or someone saying ‘hey, this band looks
cool, let's get em,” said Van Hulle. “Then they
gor huge and starred playing for tens of (how
sands ofpeoplc."

There was also the IOWrcost show in Gardr
ner Lounge on Nov. 11, I990~the Smashing
Pumpkins, whom few recognized at the time.

The administration has given students
complete responsibility to schedule concerts.
“I’ll occasionally get c-mails from administra-
tors with suggestions,” said Van Hulle. “But it's
more likely that I will seelt them out and ask
their opinions." As concerts chair, he has the
freedom to book whatever bands will agree to
come. To find bands. he garhers suggestions
from the SGA Concerts Committee and othr
ers, and books shows based on cost and almilr
ability.

or course, every eoncerrs chair has their

own way of ﬁshing for bands. John Chavez
v05 served as concerts chair in ’02-'03 and '03,
'04, and his strategy was simple. “I believed in
booking lots or smaller shows, and fewer big
shows,” said Chavez. “If a show costs $5,000
and fills up Harris with 500 people, those
same 500 people would be there if the show
cost $28,000."

Chavez's philosophy as concerts chair was
(0 play what he knew Grinnell srudents liked,
"I would consider pretty much any suggestion,"
he said. “I mostly just listened to a lot ofCD’s
and made judgments about whar the greatest
diversity of Grinnell students would enjoy."

one of Chavez's prouder moments was
Sleater~anney’s performanee at Harris in
October of 2002, during his first semester as
concerts chair. “They were one of my favorite
hands,” he said. “It was really exciting for me.
Harris was full. There were people waiting in
line while it was going on."

Another successful show was Cursive, dur-
ing Chavez's junior year in the Fall of2003. “It
was only 52,000 for three bands,” said Chavez.
“We were stressed out because Gardner wasn't
available, so it was scheduled to be at the
Forum. Then that didn’t work out, so it was
moved to Harris at the last minute."

Chavez and his crew didn't expect many
people to show up to the concert, but they
spent all day setting it up. In the end, it was
worth it: over 500 people, Grinnellians and
non—Grinnellians, packed into the lobby when
they opened the doors. Many had driven to
Grinnell trom places like Omaha speciﬁcally
for the show. ”Doing it ar Gardner would have
been a disaster—there wasn‘t nearly enough
room," Chavez said.

Not every eonecrts chair has shared
Chavez’s commitment to sinallcrrtime bands.
Brendan Baker, who was concerts chair in '04,
'05 and '057'05, tended to hook bands with
more name reeognirion. Baker oversaw cone
certs by Cake, Le Tigre, Built to Spill and Ted
Leo. Wellrknown bands might draw a diverse
crowd beyond the usual indie-music enthusi—

asts. But name recognition comes with a price:
according to the sodas May 6, 2005 issue, the
Cake concert cost roughly 540,000.

Van Hulle mentioned some of the other
big concerts to come through Grinnell over
rhe years: The Violent Femmes, Herbie Han-
cock (who attended Grinnell for a short time),
Jurassic Five,Tlic Black Eyed Peas and Bruce
Springsteen among many others.

”Jefferson Airplane was apparently leg-
endary," he said of rheir 1966 performance at
Grinnell for the homecoming dance in the old
Darby gym. "Afrer they played, it was claimed
that they peimanently changed the feel of the
college."

From the bands’ perspective, playing at
Grinnell is much different than what they may
be used to. “The venue always has something
to do wirh the show," said van Hulle. “At first,
Gardner looks like a really crappy venue. But
once the lights are our, rhe equipment is set up,
and the students come in, the place just trans-
forms. A lor of artists come up ro me telling
me they loved it and want to come back."

“Many artists find [playing in from of a
small audience] to be very quaint and personr
al," he said,“l hate Harris t works for some
things, but if you don’t get the crowd in there,
it looks bad and isn’t very fun. The smaller

venue has always been key for me."
