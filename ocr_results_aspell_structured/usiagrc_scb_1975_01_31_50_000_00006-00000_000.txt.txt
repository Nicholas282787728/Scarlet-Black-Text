Last Monday evening, students
.whi) participated in the Career
Preview internship program met
to discuss their experiences, The
internships lasted irom one week
to one month during Christmas
break, and were based in Cities
including New York, Chicago, San
Franelsco, and Minneapolis,
Approximately 50 students parr
ticipated in the program.
Although the students felt that
the experience was very valuable,
several problms were brought up.
The most noticeable dilliculties
were with housing. John Adams,
Director of Career Services, said
more time was spent on arranging
housing than on the rest oi the
program. It was thought that the

traditional vacation time of the
year was partially responsible ior
the lack oi available homes.

ilousing Problem

The location of houses was also
questioned, in several cases
lengthy commuting time was
impractical. Junior Tom Walker
participated in a theatre internship
in New York City, and found that
his arranged housing was a 21/2
hour commute from the job.
Subsequently, other housing
arrangements were made. in other
cases, an upcoming marriage and
allergies to cats in the house
caused quick housing changes.

Problems arose concerning
transportation. Commuting costs
.oiten turned out to be quite ex»
pensive. in one case, an intern
would have been unable to par-

. ticipate in the program unless a

car had been made available to her

SeasonalJobs

Several interns explained that
their jobs were seasonal, and
during the period ln which they
worked there was not a lot to 110.
Senior John Nickle worked in a
laboratory at Rutgers University,
but the school was not in lull
session at the time.

Most interns agreed that better
communication was needed bet
ween interns and sponsors betoro
the actual internship. Several
students were left with nothing to
do, or just busy work.

But the good points oi the
program far outweighed the had,
according to most of the interns.
The concept oi experiential
education or, as one student
remarked, “working with the
people," was constantly praised.

widened Career Alternatives

More career alternatives were
exposed. Junior Elaine Carey,
previously interested in jourr
nalism, now sees publishing as a
viable alternative for a career.
Jobs were redeﬁned, and the wide
variety oiiobs in one area was scen
in many oi the internships. Junior
Barbara Tholisen said she was
shown that her art interests could
be valuable in theatre work.

“Beats Just. Books"

The interns agreed that practical
experience “beats just books".
Nickle summed it up best by
saying that it is necessary to ex-
perience the shortcomings oi a job
as well as the good points. As one
student remarked, just meeting
and talking to the many people
involved in the internships was
extremely worthwhile. A positive
result oi several internships was
that students received job offers,

Future Uncertain

The future oi the program is
uncertain. To solve housing
problems, students may be forced
to arrange their own housing
Better communication could be set
up by planning the internships
earlier There is the possibility that
the program could be oiiered also
during summer and spring breaks.
The idea of including internships in
various departments ior credit was
also introduced,

AS Adams said, “Ii it works, it
will grow.” That the program
“worked” in many cases can be
seen, One intern explained, “I’m
going back during spring break to
finish, I didn't have enough time to
do everything,”

' Hit The

Trio
reviewed

by Richard Cleaver

The iirst of an indeterminate
number oi applicants for the
posxtlon of Artist in sidence.
the Mirecourt Trio, ViSIted the
campus last Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. The trio consists of
Kenneth Goldsmith, violin, Terry
Klng, cello, and John Jensen.
piano, and is currently in residence
at California State University-
Fullerton.

The Tria (at
least with its present personnel)
has been playing together ior two
years, a relatively short time in
terms oi professional ensembles.

The concert was disappointing.
The pianist was inadequate to the
technical demands of the Men
delssohn, The Thalberg was a very
weak picce, decently (although not
excitingiy) played. it is the sort of
music one might expect to en-
counter in a nineteenth century
soil-cc niusicnle where all the
listeners are asleep alter a heavy
meal. The Dvorak was also
unremarkable. The ensemble
playing was excellent between the
violin and cello. and almost
nonexistent between them and the
piano, The group seemed unable to
distinguish between passion and
volume,

The obscurity oi the music on the
program (the Mendelssohn is
known only to devotees of that
composer, the Thalberg was
receiving its iirst periormance
“West of Los Angeles,” and the
Dvorak is moderately well known)
provoked some adverse comment
irom music majors, who asked
whether the Trio were trying to
avoid comparison with other en-
sembles. in tact, the student
reaction in general was lukewarm
ithis may be partlv due to student
lack of interest); the faculty were
not iorthcoming with their
opinions.

In general, although the Trio is
not distinctly poor, it is likely that
even in so small a field as the
planartrio, Grinnell could attract a
better group.
