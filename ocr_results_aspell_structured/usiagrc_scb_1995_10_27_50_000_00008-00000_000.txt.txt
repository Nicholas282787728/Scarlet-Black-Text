Better Judgment Required

To the Editor:

On the whole, I would say that
this semester’s 5&5 is probably one
of the better versions of this newspa-
per in recent memory. I have appre—

cinted (he expanded feature section
and news articles that are for the
most part well—written, though not
always very probing.

However, I am upset by the atti-
tude that you have continually pro—

jected in your column “In the Cof-
fee?" Week after week, you have
lambasted anyone who might read
the 5&8 for not taking it seriously,
while whining about how hard it is to
doyouriob. This attitude certainly is
not new to the 5&B's editorial pages
or evento its front pages, Le. Fall '90
St Fall ‘92, and so I tolerated it,

But your column on Friday. Oc<
tober 13th made me shiver. First of
all, 1 was alarmed to read, “The eth—
ical issues involved ineditinga news-
paper are quite a bit more troubling
than most of you might imagine.”
With these words, Dan, you finally
convinced the that you do not regard
your editorial position as that of a
public servant, but instead as a place
from which to lecture the readership
about why they should have more
respect (or you.

In addition to illustrating that
you are mistaken about the proper
role of Grinnell’s newspaper editor,

a clear error about the ethics ofiour»
nolism. While I would not wish to
defend the relative worth of Mr
Devin Drown'sidioticletterthatyou
addressed in your column, I accept
that it is reasonable policy for the
5&8 [0 print all of its letters to the
Editorsinceias you have repeatedly
pointed oulilhere are generally so
few.

However, it was incorrect of you
to soy. “Refusing letters to the editor
because of their content would be
censorship. pure and simple." (By
this sentence. I assume you mean
that refusing to print letters because
of their content would be censor—
ship.) If my assumption—vnecesm—

is wrong because a distinction exists
between editing and censorship.

Editing content is your job as
editor to make the newspaper worth
reading. In contrast, censorship, a

practice that is all the more danger»
ous when misunderstood, is used to
mandate a moral orethical code. An
editor with better judgment proba—
bly wouldn‘t have included Drown's
letter at all, and certainly would not
have asserted that a journalist‘s eth—

ad,

In fact. by deciding to print the
letter and underhandedly criticize it
in the very next column, you have
castyourselrinnroiethnr is more like
a censor than an editor. The only
difference between what a censor
does and what you have done is that
you did not exclude material that
you evidently conSidered objectione
able, but instead ridiculed it. The
result is the same because the objec-
tionahle material is suppressed as a

editorial section does not eX|S( “as a
forum for personal complaints, pri—
vate agendas, or inside ,otes," ex—

If this sounds far-fetched, please
consider that your self-righteous at-
titude could cause people to censor
themselves Perhaps there are read—
ers who would write letters to the
editor but hesitate because they are

that in this "forum," you will claim
the final word,

Other than that, Dan, keep up
the good work.
