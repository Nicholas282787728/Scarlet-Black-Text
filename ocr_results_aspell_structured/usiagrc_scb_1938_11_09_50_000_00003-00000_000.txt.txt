Plan to Finance
Student Groups
From Common Fund

Columbus, o.—(ACPi——Atter a
year's successful tidal, Ohio State
university will this year subsir
dize activities of student organi-
zations under a plan novel in
United States colleges and uni-
versities.

Five hundred dollars has been
set aside to help student groups
bring speakers to the campus, cx—
pand social activities, and carry
out other organized projects. Ad-
ministered by a dean and a com-
mittee of students, the plan will
encourage extracurricular intel-
lectual interests for students,

Bringing in of outside speakers
is the most common use for the
mind.

Last year one club bought an
”official rubber stamp" to use on
its bulletins and put up a club
bulletin board. Two clubs joined
in converting an abandoned lock-
er room into a social room,

Reference handbooks and li-
brary books were purchased by
several organizations. The Pen
and Brush club found it possible
with this assistance to present a
downtown exhibition of its work.

students in one department used
their subsidy to secure a portrait
of the department chairman and
they plan to use their grants in
succeeding years to add to the
collection of portraits of those
who have contributed to the pro-
ression.

Huffman---

Continued from page 1

I feel. largely the ephemeral ap-
peal of novelty and of represenr
tational music. Like much mod
ern literature they uere clear-
cut. witty, sombre.

The climax of the evening,
from the point of view both of
music and pcrformancc, was the
Vaughan Williams setting of six
Housman poems for tenor, string
quartet. and piano, it is perhaps
a pointed commentary on our
unnatural tear or modern music
that we feel the need to grow
used to these songs.

As a matter of fact, they were
composed in 1003, thirtyrfive
years ago. Thirty»flve years is
a brief instant in the history of
mankind, but a considerable peri-
od in the life of a man, Com-
paratively speaking, these are
not new songs, Be that as it
may, they are tremendously ef-
fective musical presentations of
some of the loveliest English
lyrics. Most impressive at first
hea ng are “15 My Team Ploughv
mg?” and "Bredon Hill.” The
quieter beauty of “Clun” makes
it my favorite.

We owe a special vote of
thanks to F. Walter Huffman and
.his accompanists for giving us
the opportunity to hear these sel-
dom heard songs. Last evening's
performance was a live. fresh and
spontaneous one of the sort that
is possible only for music that
has not acquired a traditional ins
terpretatioh.
