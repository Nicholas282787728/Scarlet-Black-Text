A new system for scratching names
has been used, the name of a man who
has been hei'e before being scratched
with that of an old girl and each be-
ing given the names of two new Stu—
dents, The man is to call for his two
men students and the girl for her new
girls, than the old man together with
his new students will call for the old
girl at her cottage and they will his
troduce the four new students to each
