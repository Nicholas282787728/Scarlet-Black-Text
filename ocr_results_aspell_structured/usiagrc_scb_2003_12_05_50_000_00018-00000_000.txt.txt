A celeb on of stupidity

The week after the ofﬁcial conclusion
of the cross-country season, Stupid Week
begins. This week of activities tests the
physical and mental limits at the
participants.

”The cross-country team has a sort of

longstanding tradition of stupidity, said . ,

runner Nick Gill '05, “and stupid week is
the culmination and celebration of that
stupidity”

Gill himself Is in charge of the kickoff
eveht nf_5tupid Week, the Beer Mile. a
grueling challenge not meant for the faint
of heart. .

”Eath participant gets one hour to
drink six beers and then they are given
ten minutes to warm up," Gill explaineds
”Then, they all run a mile on the indoor
track with the-goal or breaking five
minutes. Each participant who breaks five
minutes gets the beer they drank for free,
and wins one inure six pack of their
choosing. Participants who fail to break
ﬁve minutes for the mile have to pay me
back for the six beers they drank before
they ran.“

This year, five men earned the right to
get their drinks on the house, Adam

Booth '04 set an all-time Beer Mile record,
bettering his record irorn last year by less
than a second with atime or 4141.8. This
time is impressive considering that the
NCAA indoor standard time is around 4:15.

"The 5: (ll) goal of the challenge is a
little slower than my Skin race pace,”
Booth said ,.

Mitch Herz '05 David Hour 05, Peter
tueno '06 and Colin Tschilta '05 rounded
wit the top five under the ﬁve minute
mark Patrick Waldo '06, Tom Peter '05 and
Devin Mccranahan '01. just barely missed
the tutoff

Three women ran this year, but neither
Lola Garcia '06, Sam Thomas ‘04 nor Laura
Zdiinek ’07 could ﬁnish the mile.

The Beer Mile was rationed by an
arrangement of other events. The rest of
Stupid Week has included the No Hands
Dinner, Cookie bay (eating only cookies'
for an entire day), the Weezer Classic (a
cross country team basketball game),
Towel Dinner and Slim movie night on
rhursday (team members do to dinner in a
towel, then go to the Slum to rvatrh a
movie), and drunken dodgehall today.
