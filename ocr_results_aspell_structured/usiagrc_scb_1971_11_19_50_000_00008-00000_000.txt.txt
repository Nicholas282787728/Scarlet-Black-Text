Camping In Iowa: Roughing It

Today we are going to examine
one at tiie otiier aspects oi sports
at Cirilltiell, namely one of those
which isn‘t in ttie nature oi a va
sity activity, but oi a more ilitliV
dual nature. The sport oi which i
speak is one which is near aiid dear
to the hearts otagroiving segment oi
the campus population, namely.
camping.

As a member oi the west-coast
(Caiiiorma to be exact) camping
sorority, camping meant to niegoing
out into the mountains, sleeping bag
in hand, to break out on the clear-
(i,e. morerorrless smog iree)
mountain air and pine hugs. Camp-
ing was one or tiie things wiiicii i
didn't associate with the spaces at
the grel mid-west. Therefore, i
left my trusty backpack and canteen
at home, not expecting to use them
again until Christmas. Little did i
know that the hardy inhabitatits oi
the wide open spaces indulged in what
i supposed to be that most western
or all sports, camping a la Teddy
Roosevelt

Team Better
Than Record

The 1971 Grinnell soccer team has
a record of 37471. Even Ihough they
have not reached the live hundred
mark this season the team has not
played bad soccer.

This is evident when the season is
reviewed. Two of the four losses
came during the last iive minutes oi
the game, and DnelDSS Came when the
pioneers were missing iourstar.
ters.

There were several memorable
games this season. The Grinnelle
Knox games seemed to be the most
exciting. Knox won both games, but
neither were runaways. In the first
game Knox led 3-1 with ten minutes
leit in the game. A Grinneli rally
tied the game, but Knox scored dur-
ing the iinal minute or play. The
second Knox game went much the
same way, with Grinnell down 271,
evening up the score with live min
utes left on the clock, and losingthe
game with less than two minutes
beiore the final whistle.

More pleasurable were the opening
game oi the season against Coe, and
the game against Cornell which look
place over midesemester break. The
Coe game, played in Cedar Rapids,
gave the season an optimistic be
ginning. Grinnell won this amazing
contest 54. The Cornell game was
probably the Pioneers best effort Of
the season. A gargantuan effort by
the Offense zipped the ball through
the net seven times. The Stirling
characters of lhe defense Shdwed
through as they shut out the Core
nell kickers.

During this season several indivie
duals turned in outstanding perior-
mances. The most spectacular of
these was Steve Korstzd who led the
team in scoring goals. Two other
players deserve to be mentioned
here. They are John Vidalech and
Lee Edomds. Vidatech held the de—
iense together all year, while
Edomds, the goalie, made many
difficult saves
