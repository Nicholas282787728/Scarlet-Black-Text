Sex and the
City
(2008}

Sexy, sassy ladies strut their stuff

rev rind/1M Clly is the defrnition ota guilty pleasure—bur 0/;
what a fabulous guilty pleasure it is.

Tire odd thing about the televrsion series and especially the
movie is that rt lras nothrng and everything to do with reality.
The women who populate this ﬁlm seem at times to be liv-
ing on another planet one on which rt is perfectly ordinary for
a person to treat themselves to $50, 000 worth of diamond
jewelry and to hire a personal assistantjust to sort e mails. Fr
nancial crisis? No worries here!

But at the same time, the themes oflove and friendship, and
how difﬁcult and wonderful both ofthose things can be, are er
plotcd beautifully and only reinforced by the way the actresses
fully inhabit their characters,

The storyline revolves around columnist/author Carrie
Bradshaw (Sarah )essica Parker) and her three best friends: the
prim and sweet wife and mother Charlotte York (Kristin Davis),
hard-edged lawyct Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon)7 also a
wife and mother—and the sexually ravenous Samantha Jones
(Kim carttall), a successful publicist wlro lives in Los Angeles.

This movie is clearly a love letter to the Fans on the teltvir
sion series, but people rvho have never sccrr the show will also
be able to enjoy it (on a lesser level). in the ope. *rg few mine
utes, Sex andm any takes time to reintroduce us to its layered
and wonder-rul princrpal characters, though, to be sure, Fans will
be able to pick rap on nuances rirat newcomer-s will rrrrss.

Cariie ﬁnds herselfin a settled and committed relationship
with the love of lrer lite. Charlotte is exceedingly happy with
hei role as wife and mother. Miranda is overworked and over
stres d, as usual Samantha can't ﬁgure ourwhy shc’ rot hape
pier living in Los Angeles with her gorgeous actor boyfriend
smith (Jason Lewis).

All ofthe aetots and actresses in the film inhabit their ch “7
utters 't~ easrly and coinfoitably as they did during the shows
sia suc ssrul season lhe tour friends are es pecially good, ll»
though therr staiy lines do lrmir or enhance horv nrrrclr they’re
allowed to shine. Of the foul, Davis as Charlotte has the least
to do. She's on lurnd to be happy, srrpporr her friends .rrrd do
the occasional comedic blt, Clittirtlol's Samantha also has little
to do in the ﬁlm, despite her character usually berng one or‘ the
most unpredictable and exciting otthe four.

The best storylines belong to Parkei’s Carrie and Nixon’s
Miranda Parker is a vibrant actress, and beautifully expressive.
when Carrie and Mr, Big (Chris Noth) trrn into relationship
trouble early in the film, our hearts go out to her.

But our hearts break for Miranda when she must face hei
husband Steve's (David Eigenberg) rnfrdelrty. Miranda is a
difficult character to play: not as demonstrative as her other
friends, often stressed and bitter, a guarded pessimist. Brit that’s
what makes her human, and so wonderful. Havrr-rg cautiously
ler love into her life, she seems prepared and matterrofrfaet by
the way it lets her down. When she says. "You broke us. What
we had is broken," to her husband, we break down too.

When Carrie goes to an rilone and emotionally downrarrdr
out Miranda on New Year's Eve rind tells her friend. "You are
not alone", it reminds us how tender such seemingly disposable
films can be. This isn't oscar fare, but it is an enjoyable and
sweet film.

'i‘he inspiring story of a Jamaican hobsled team coupled
with the comedic genius of John Candv Creates what 6\CIV
moviegoer hopes to sec: a timeless classic to be i'iva led only by
D2:T/)ri11ig/i/yDrrz/r (the best movie ever)

All exaggerations aside, Coal Rmmiuwr brings the enter
tainment in buckets. The plot moves slow at times, and the
actrrrg (l'm looidng at you, John Candy . and you, e\cryonc
else) leaves something to be desired, brrt its easy enough to lg
noie that when you consider that this movie is rihotitjainaiean
bobsleddcis.

When sprinter Dericc Brannock (Leon Robinson) fails to
trualrfy for the Olymprcs, he realizes rlrartlre tour man bobslcd
is his best wav to make it to Calgary. \\7ith his best friend
Sanka (Doug E Dong) it his side Detice finds a term and a
colicl’i( (John Candy) willing to put tlrcit reputations on the line
fora shot at gold The rest or the movie tollows their waclry
adventures.involving relucrurr parents, elitist snobs .rnd, (you
guessed rtl) )Jamareans in snowl

The strength ot‘rhrs movie comes in its ability to rake peo-
ple back to a time when they watched sporting events and acnr-
ally believed that greatne557or surprising mediocrity—could
be achieved with hard work and hilarious obese coaches. In this
case, the true story (theJamaieans didn‘t finish better than 14th
in either 198% or 1992) srmply attests to the lovable incompe-
tence and heart that makes this a great film

Coa/Rllnm‘ngr made the very short list ofmovies I brought
to college, so dragging yourself over to Harris for nvo hours
or enjoyment is well worth it. And hey, rfyou're particularly
inspired. us primetime for bobsled student initiatrves (North
campus loggia, anyone?) Maybe it's time for all ofus to feel
the rhyrhm and the rhyme. Or at least get on up, because it's
bobsled time.

his younger brother lying in bed, lorlornly chewing paper.

in addition to the y ung iictors' precocious performances

the consequences of such an approach to social relationships
primarily by focusing on the children's plight but also by sug»
gesting a connection between this way of thinking and other
effecrs,such as brrllyirrg in Japanese schools. The children's one
friend other young friend in the outside world, Saki, rs a victim
of bullying whose problems are equally ignored by a society
that would rather look the other way.

When Koereda focuses the camera on the oldest boy,

sions that surge with a mature mix of longing, confusion, and
worry. Tire scripts minimalist dralog iequires this sort otemor
