Plot summary
The play is loosely based
on his importance oi
Being Earnest, Osmr Wilde’s
1895 play. Stoppard lifted
lines and characters from
the work, although he
moved the setting to 1917
Zurich and the characters
have been replaced with
Lenin, James Joyce and the
founder of Dadaisrri, Tristan
Tzara. Gwendolyn and
Cetily, original characters
irom Wilde’s play, remain as
themselves, although here
they serve as helpers to
Joyce and Lenin
respectively.

in 1917, Joyce, Tzara
and Lenin, each a
revolutionary in his own
way, was living in Zurich.
[air was there too.
Carr would tell you that he
knew all three men. He
would have you believe
that Tzara was in fact his
guild friend. He would have
you believe that he was the
British Consul to Zurith and
that he almost stopped
lenin irom returning to
Russia to lead the
Bolshevih Revolution. Carr's
memory is deeply fallible.

ihere is one thing that
is true. In 1917 Carr played
the lead character,
Algernon, in Joyce's
production of its
Importance of Being Earnest
with moderate sutcess.
when Joyce paid him a
measly ten francs ior the
rule, (air was rncensed. He
demanded that Joyre
reimburse him for the
expensive trousers he had
bought for the role. Joyce
refused and in return
demanded that Carr pay
him 25 fronts for the
tickets that [an had given
away. A protratted legal
battle ensues. The Final
outcome of that battle
ends the play.
