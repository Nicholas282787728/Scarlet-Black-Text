THEY AWAIT OUR INTEREST

Preoccupied by scholastic work and so—
c all activities, we are all too prone to for-
.et that one of the many advantages of
ollege is the opportunity offered for cul-
ural development by the extra curricular
lrogram of the colleges. Here, indeed, the
«.tudcnt is offered opportunities which he
lrobably will not be able to afford after
caving college even should he be fortunate
enough to have them available.

Nor is it necessary for the student doe
sirous of taking advantage of these Oppol‘r
tuhities to feel he must neglect his social
or scholastic activities, nor on the other
hand feel that there is really “nothing to
do” on the day some particular lecture, con-
cert or exhibit is scheduled. In the first
instance, he will often find it possible to
combine elements of scholastic or social life
with cultural development. In the second,
he will find numerous opportunities along
less formalized lines,

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

For example, we might mention the art
exhibits hung regularly in the quadrangle
Works by masters of painting, drawings
and etchings chosen by a. member of our
faculty who is in her own right a leader in
the world of art, Miss Edith Sterllfeld, who
is to be honored with a one man exhibit of
her own work at the famous Joslyn Me-
morial gallery in Omaha next month.

In the field of literature there are re-
gularly planned exhibits in the library
which are great aids to a more complete
understanding of the great body of really
fine literature.

The opportunities are all about us wait-
ing only for us to evince interest in gaining,
while we may, a true appreciation of the
best in such fields as art, music and litera-

ture.

LOOKING FORWARD

When the board of trustees of Grin-
llell college holds its annual meeting here
June 3, it will be called upon to decide a
question which it may consider trifling but
which is of utmost importance to all Grill-
nell students. That is the fate of the White
house.

Louis V. Phelps, college treasurer has
already conditionally approved the Student
Council’s plan to reopen the house next
year. Final approval must, however, come

from the board of trustees.

It is our belief that the White house,
under the capable supervision of Mrs. Hazel
M. Bishop, And directed by an able Student
Council committee has amply proved its
right to a continued existence, Its use by
students is equally ample proof of its ful-
filling zt real need.

Bearing these facts in mind, we have
no fear of the outcome of the Vote. We are
looking forward to enjoyment of the White
house next year,

TIME OUT

(Reprinted from Upper Iowa Collegian)

The whistle blows; the referee calls
“Tillie Out." Why? Those fellows aren’t
nearly exhausted. Why not let them con‘
tinue playing? Within a few days the pro—
fessors will dismiss us for a vacation.
Why? We are just nicely in the swing of
things. Why call “time out” to us?

Amid the rush and bustle of spring-
time with her numerous things to do we
find it necessary to take tilnc out. Not just
to relax a bit, rest a while but to get our
bearings straight—to locate anew our goal.
Through the game of life our emotions fre»
quently hide this goal from our sight.
Anger, fear, love, hateihow easily they ob—
scure our vision. They are as necessary to
us as the air around us, but they must be
guided and guarded. So to all youth we
cry “time out.”

OFF THE CAMPUS

By John Spaulding

The supreme court controversy
is upon us again. What with
Washington officialdom accusing
Justice Black of ignorance and
Secretary of Agriculture Wallace
attacking the court, it's no wonder
most people are looking on the
“Black" side of things.

is s r

Some New Deal exponents are
mean enough to suggest that
criticism of Black is a backhanded
slap at President Roosevelt. With
more Supreme court vacancies in
the offing, it would he too had
to get another Justice “dumb”
enough to hand down opinions
outlawing "big business” monop-
olistic practices.

The c. i, 0. took mother lick-
ing this week, this time in Penn-
sylvania where its political can-
didates were hadly beaten. Even
that broad grin of “Jim" Farley's

couldn't quite hide the specter of
John L. Lewis ruling Pennsyl-
vania.

We see in the papers that Hit-
lcr may marry the Princess Marie
of Italy. It is said that he has
already proposed, though he only
met her last week. It may he
the “love bug,"'but, perish the
thought, could it be a desire to
strengthen the RomeVBel'lin axis?

e e t

Following Hitler‘s week in Italy,
Britain and France announced in
firm, loud tones that they stand
“shoulder to shoulder" regarding
the European situation. A posi»
tion, “shoulder to shoulder" and
"on the fence," must somewhat
resemble Emil Ludwig’s “some-
where between time and etern-
ity.”

Olivia Dionne, father of the
quintuplets, angered by charges
that he was squandering his
money by buying six expensive
cars in a year and a half, told
reporters he had only one car, a

 

Packard, “but a small one." After
all, his daughters pay for one,
why shouldn’t he own one?

s . r

Railway workers are forehande

cd. In response to threats that
wages might have to be cut,
they announced this week that
such a move would mean a strike.
Many years ago the boss hired,
fired and set the wages. Now
the workers are big hearted;
they'll let him take the risks of
doing business while they take
the pay.

J-larry Hopkins asks for funds

with which to make more W. P.
A. projects. We'd still like to
know if that means more work.
more projects, or more administra-
tion.

Germany announces plans tor a
canal to he completed hy 1945
which will link the Rhine, Main
and Danuhc rivers. Even a big
canal will he pretty small to {lost
the expensive battleships the na-
tions are building these days.
