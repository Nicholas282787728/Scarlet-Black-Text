Dr. Nels Ferre Well Received
By S+uclen+s And S’ra‘i‘i Alike

“Christian Faith in Our Times" was the theme of the 1950
Gates religious lecture series, delivered by Dr. Nels Ferre, of Van-
derbilt University. Judging from the large attendance at all his
lectures, Mr. Ferre was well received by the students and faculty.

The first lecture, presented
during a convocation Monday
morning in Darby gym, ques-
tioned present-day liberalism on
the college campus. Dr. Ferre
pointed out that liberalism in
present-day living is not ade
quate for understanding all
man’s actions. Comprehension of
man's unobservable purposes is
necessary for an agreement of
reason and faith,

Freedom and Turmoil

“God and These Times" was
the subject of Dr. Ferre's Mon»
day evening lecture in Herrick
chapel. "God made the world
precarious and predictable," he
Said, attributing today’s world
turmoil to our “freedom to make
it that way."

“Prayer is the greatest pos-
sible power for changing our
lives and the world," said Dr.
rerre Tuesday morning in the
third lecture, "Prayer and Prov-

idence." Concluding, he declared
“Living in full balance of the
whole self dedicated to God, we
find deep, lasting peace."

ln the fourth lecture Tuesday
evening, "What Must the Church
Do To Be Saved?” Dr. Ferre
spoke for unity and fellowship
within the Christian church. He
decried the tendency within the
Protestant church to move away
from itself.

Sociologlcul stranger l

“A Christian is a sociological
stranger and is psychologically
maladjustcd," declared Dr. Ferre
in the concluding lecture, Wed-
nesday morning. He explained
this by saying that the Chris-
tian defensively magnifies his,
minority statues but does not
iconfol‘m for maiority approval,
He does not use man as a stand-i
ard, but uses God as his stand
