’19 CycloneMay
Appear Soon

Have Been Three Shifts a Day
Busy on Annual for Al-
, most e Year

That the 1919 C. lone will make its
appearance any time between )lnrcti
2d and June 1st, the prediction made
by a member or the 1919 annual board
yesterday.

“Grlnncll students may expect the
"Cyclone" about a month and a half
eailicl- than usual," stated a member
of the annual board when interviewed.
“But, of course, we cannot give the
deﬁnite date of its appearance. That
would rob the students or anticipation
which is so characteristic of annual
rumors," he continued.

“There need be no reason for cable
outlagc," added another member of tbc
board. “The annual this year will be
out earlier than usual; how early 1
cannot say. But 1 woultl not be sur-
prised to hear the chapel bell ring and
the whistle of the heating plant blow,
announcing its a. lvzil any time in the
near future."

"There have been three sbitts 9. day
busy- on the annual since last March,
and the book has taken form rapidly.
Any mysterious rinnor regarding the
coming of the 15119 Cyclone at this
time may be taken 5 ’IOUSl)’, but natu-
rally the bound is quite reticent on the

matter,” he concluded.
