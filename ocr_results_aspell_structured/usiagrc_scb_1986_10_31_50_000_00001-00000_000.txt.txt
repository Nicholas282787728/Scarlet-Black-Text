Human Resource
Center Opens...

By John Harrison

The opening oi the Human Resource
Center marks the end of a long process in
which the college administration was in
volved in a heated Confrontation with the
Grinnell College Gay Community and its
supporters.

The process for a resource center began
last year as the campus experienced
numerous outbreaks of homophobic van-
dalism and public expression. Last Spring.
an art exhibit in the Forum's Negative
Space gallery was vandalized with
homophobic expressions created with the
destroyed art. Also Burling Library
washrooms were struck with hostile
homophobic graiiiti and the Outcry
published a justification for homophobic
attitudes based on religious and biological
grounds

In an effort to directly deal with the

growing prejudices on campus Student Air
iairs and other campus organizations join
ed together in calling tor the creation of a
resource center. Yet, conflict arose
when the administration proposed that a
“Human Resource Center” be established
and housed in the renovated Younker
Health Center.

Immediately. the gay community and its
supporters rejected the administration’s
proposal and called tor the establishment
of a separate gay resource center. The gay
community's opposition to the administra-
tion's proposal was based on the belief that
the college administration ought to make a
direct commitment to the needs oi gays on
campus by establishing a completely
distinct resource center.

The administration held to the belief that

...litier Dispute
Resolved

By John Harrison
After a long and bitter struggle. the

Human Resource Center will open its'

doors tomorrow Located in the Youliker
lleallh Center building. the Human
Resource Center’s stated purpose is to pro-
vidc "a place ror students to learn about
themselves and others. The center will
house reference materials covering all
aspects sexauality. women's issues. men's

issues. and health relationships and>

cultural issues, The center will also spans
sor several outreach programs in many
areas to inform the campus community in
the many areas oi human realtionships.

The primary emphasis oi the Human
Resrouce Center is as an educational
facility. Bill Turner, a member of the
Human Resource Center Advisory Group,
said that the center is “approaching the
problems of ignorance and prejudices
through education." RJ. Baker, a
member of the Human Resource. Center
Advisory Group stressed that ”the Center
is to celebrate differences” within the
Grinnell Community. \

Along with the Human Resource Center,
other resource centers including the Gay

Resource Center villi be housed ill the
same location. Rd. Baker. said. “Each
center will exist side by side on an equal
basis." Baker said. "There are as many
different rooms with as many different
names."

Another feature of the Human Resource
Center is its emphasis on the college's Per-
sonal Development Program which is part
of the Student Affairs Office. Julie Fraser,
Resident Advisor and a member of the
Center’s Advisory Group stressed that the
Human Resource Center will sponsor pro-
grams on such‘ topics as eating disorders
and rape awareness. The center also in7
tends to conduct outreach programs in the
dorms to help increase people's awareness
of important issues

in describing the way the center was go-
ing to operate. Beth Johnson. a member oi
the Center's Advisory Group said that she
wanted to get students involved directly.
Johnson expressed hope that all Grinnell
student use the resource center and par—
ticipate in in operations.

Although Johnson said that there has

Concert Spawns
Controversy

By May-lee Chai

The Wednesday night concert by
“Romanovsky and Phillips" created more
controversy than most groups that play in
the Pub. Even bciore their appearance.
posters advertising the group were ripped
from walls, thrown away or defaced. The
duo. which is described as “political folks
lngers.” was sponsored by the Grinnell
College Gay Community.

The controversy was expected. however.
Grinnell Colelge Gay Community advertis-
ed in advance a discussion on Thursday to
discuss the concert,

“Besides the obvious controversy, which
is that they are gay. they do fit a more
negative streotype oi gays,“ GCGC
member Ashley Abel said.

However, it was felt the message_in the
group's songs 7 which deal with
homophobia. Conformity. interpersonal
frustration among other things 7 was

strong enough to overcome the negative
reactions.

The purpose of bringing the group to
campus was “to educate the people to a lot
of issues," according to R.J. Baker. who
wrote the proposal asking for funds to br-
ing the group here train the Political Ac-
lion Students Fund.

“There’s a lot more to being gay than
sex and that sex has nothing to do with be-
ing gay, It involves a certain way of seeing
the world, feeling the world. and relation
ships within the world." Baker said.

in addition to the concert GCGC sponr
sored n Sapphic Salon poetry reading
earlier this month and plans to sponsor
several other events this year open to the
entire campus A Women's Minority Dina
ner and Men's Unity Dinner will coincide
with the opening week'oi the Gay Resource

ARH Renovation: '
Plans Present
Major Changes

By May-lee Chai

Plans are currently being drawn up for
major renovations on ARH, Steiner, and
Goodnow which will fundamentally affect
the campus community.

The renovation work is scheduled to
begin with ARH the first of June, 1988, and
will take an estimated 14 months to com-
plete, During this time, the entire building
must be vacated. The loss of classroom, ofr
(ice. and study space is a major problem.

“We will be using every available space
on campus . . .some dormitory lounges for
classroom space and other facilities,
perhaps such as Windsor House and some
of the small rooms on campus that are not
currently being used as classes," vice-
president Waldo Walker said

Walker also Considers the Community
center and memorialbuilding in town as
possible sources oi classrooms

The loss of the auditorium for movie
showing is less easily solved, At this point,
South Lounge will be the only iacility [or
li‘iDVieS once the renovation work begins.
However, Walker mentioned the possibili-
ty of constructing a “low-expense building
