I The rant: , spoon conspiracy

Spoons are delightﬁil utensils, one third of
‘ty of Western silverware So why are
there ne r any in the dining hall? 1 frequyently
have to Visit three or four silverware racks to find
a simple spoon, with which to eat soup or cereal
or perhaps even pudding orsonte sort. It would
be one thing if all these i‘aelts had merely run
out of spoons, as they sometimes do. However,
equally as orteni discover a silverware raelt full
of utensils—knives and forks, that is! Does the
dining hall not believe people use spoons? Or are
there groups of people who precede me to meals
each day and, with ninjaelilte stealth, remove and
replaee all the spoons? Perhaps, with the removal
or door guards, spoons are being stolen at an
alarming pace? Whatever the reason: the spoon
shortage outages me. ,

One thing I really miss about my experience _
studying ahroad In London is that men would al-
ways wash their hands lifter using the bathroom
Yes, the urinals were way too close to one another,
and British people say the oddest things, but at least
they washed their hands! In the past few weeks I
have seen more guys leave the washroom near rite
dining hall without washing their hands than I saw
all last year. I understand Grinnellidlls like to be
non-eoniorntists. I understand its hip to be dirty
and stinky and not shower for two days (or two
weeks, or two years). But please, please wash your
hands after you peel The fact that Grinnelljans
don't shower gives us all the more reason to be con—
cerncd about genital hygiene.
