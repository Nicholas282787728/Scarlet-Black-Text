worthy publication.

I knocked at the door, but in vain.

even for the date which I missed7
for the sight which 1 saw was enough
to bring tears of joy to the eyes of
a. Staff detective.

There I saw a member of our own
English department, even he who
aspired to green trousers and red
hair, and it member of our own School
of music, even he who is tall and
wears a moustache, and many other
tligllltllries. Lost were they to the

Friday’s Discussion in Chapel‘
Ends Series "Vertebrate
Sense Organs.”

Prof. G. H, Parker clo’sed his series
of lectures on the “Vertebrate Sense:
Organs" yesterday in a general surn—
111ng up of the entire series, which
has included eight lectures in chapel
'md three lectures a week in the
zoology department.

Some of the peculiarities or the nor—
vous system as they affect the pets
sonality and the actions of the human
being were recalled by Professor Par—
ker, who drew examples from the sea
the earthworm, and the
That the whole personality

spouse.

' of a person should be governed by the

action of about one cubic inch of mat-
ter in the person’s head, was comment-
erl upon as one of the peculiarities of
the human constitution.

)[ucll Progress.

The progress in research work in
anatomy and especially in the nervous
system was also revealed by Professor
Parker during his series of lectures.
The remarkable fact that even the rate .
of progress of an impulse along one of
the nervc transmission lines can be
measured by taking one of the nerve
'cells out of a frog or some other ani-
rnal and exciting it with electricity
was shown.

The main question discussed in the
last two lectures was the unestiou of

Awhelhel‘ the heart beat is a muscular

or a nervous action. It was shown
that the heul'flheztts before there are
any nerve connections, in the case of
the tadpole or the unbatcbed chicken.
but the fact that the beating of the
heart in the adult is sometimes affects
ed by the nervous condition loads one
to think that it becomes an action
controlled by the nerves. No ﬁnal den
cision was rendered on this question.

Professor Parker left this mornins
for the east. During his stay here he
has been the guest of President and
Mrs. Main. His lectures, in spite of
their more or less technical nature,
have been well attended. Mr. Parker
stated yesterday that his lectures had
been much better attennded than be
had expected.

Midway in the first half Ames broke
into the load on long shots by Shepard
and Currre. For the remainder of the
period the play was fast and hard-
rougbt, both fives fighting on ,a con—
sistently even basis. The floor work
of both Amos and Grinnsll was ex—
cellent, but both missed many easy
shots at the hoop after working the
boil down. The only factor which
slowed up the play at all was the
large number or fouls.

Benz and Evans played brilliant ball
for Grinhell during the lralf. which
ended 15—10 in Ames- favor.

counters when Macy scored from the

strongly, holding the Aggies mitotic»

by Benz put the Grimlell five in the
