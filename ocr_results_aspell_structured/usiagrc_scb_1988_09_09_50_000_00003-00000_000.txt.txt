money available to be allocated

scheduling and funding parties. it

KDlC rules

to know the consequences if they
put themselves in [but type of
situation. but, the way they want
to handle it now, every little
complaint will be legitimmized
because of the hearing process.
Things will get blown out of
proportion”

Jones said he sees the new
rules as another step in the im-
provement of the station.

"The station is getting better.
there is no doubt. Over the past
few years there has been a marked
improvement,“ he said. "We
have people that are very inter-
ested in putting out the best."

The mics are not to make the
station boring, Seaman said.
They allow DJ: a lot of freedom
to do what they want

"In the past its been more of
a party. It is and could be a lot
of fun; however, we are a real ra-
dio station with a real listening
community. We want a balance
between good times and profes-
sional quality." he said. "We

want to make a station that is
enjoyable to listen to."

”incompetence" of the "pathetic
cowards," said Macho. The at-
tackers sped away, but not fast
enough to avoid the recording of
their license plate number. he
said. The numbers were later
given to the police.

"What frightened and mind-
less people [ihe attackers] must
be to be reduced to this cowardly
and despicable act," said Macho.
He was clear to point out that the
GLGA would continue to meet
every Thursday night at nine, not

merely in spite of, but to a large
extent because of their aggressors'
"idiotic attitude."

Macho also suggested that the
student group CAUSE, the
Coalition for Awareness, Unity.
and Social Equality, which ex-
isted last year, should start up
again. "It is exactly when you
[homophobic people] attempt to
push us back that we will fight
back, by any means necessary.
until no one lives in fear of your
sick violence and bigotry," he
said.
