LETTERS TO THE EDITO

Students Respond to S&B
Exclusion from Night Rally

To the editor.

We are writing a response to the
staff editorial in the Nov. 2 issue
concerning tthake Back theNight
Rally.

First, in reference to your claim
that“the newspapercannot present
complete coverage of an event due
to intentional exclusion,“ we feel
that the Scarlet and Black's
exclusion of an hourand 1'0 minutes
of the event because of 10 minutes
of requestedconfrdentiality is unjust
to all involved.

The program was notspeciftcally
about sexual abuse, or the Sexual
AbuseSupportGmup, but die many
acts of violence committed against
women and men in this society.
The exclusion of the valuable and
instructive information provided by
the many other speakers trivializes
the issues at hand. For those who
were unable to attend the rally and
were denied the information due to
the self-righteousness of the
“media," issues such as
homophobia, racism, domestic
violence, physical abuse, emotional

abuse, sexual abuse and other forms
of personal violation were
presented.

Second, in reference to the
statement “the Scarlet and Black
cannot and will not allow its
coverage to be manipulated," we
feel that ignoring the other issues
presented above is a more adequate
representation of manipulation.
Much time, effort and information
were virtually ignored and
misrepresented.

Finally, in response to the belief
that “it Should be left to ﬁle
discretion of themedia," therequest
was simply to protect the
conﬁdentiality and anonymity of
the student giving the personal
testimony.

The reporter was asked to leave
AS A MEMBER OF TI-HE PRESS.
The . organizer of the event
approached the reporter and
informed her that she may attend
the presentation AS A MEMBER
OF THE STUDENT BODY. The
reporterrefused. Wenever intended
to abridge the First Amendment
rights of the press, but rather we

asked that the press be sensitive to
issues of confidentiality.

EDITORIAL REPLY: The
media was asked to leave with no
prior notice that such a request
wouldbemade, Atno pointwas the
reporterapproachedandtherequest
explained by any of the organizers
until after 45 minutes had passed.
The reporter was informed about
what could have been done only
after the fact. At this point, the

reponer told the organizer that thcv

coverage had been compromised
and decisions regarding the story
had to bediscussed with the editorial
staff. Having been informed that
the event was virtually over, the
reporter declined to re-enter.

S&B Insensitive t0 Abuse Victims

To the editor.

We have always applauded the
staff of the Scarlet and Black, and
especiallyupheldthcirrecentappeal
to the campus for greater support.
However,weweredisillusionedand
outraged by the staff editorial letter
regarding the Women Take Back
the Night tally. We believe that
yourclaim,“The Scarlet andBlac/c
cannot and will not allow its
coveragetobemanipulated"shows
nothing more than obvious lack of
respect for and insensitivity towards
the survivors of sexual abuse.

You state that “the request [for
the press to leave die room] was
made to protect the confidentiality
of the speakers who were telling

STRAIT:
Flag Burner
Discourteous

personal stories of assaultand rape."
This sentence shows that you
understood why you were asked to
leave, butyou simply did notrespcct
the survivors‘ right to privacy.
Picture-takers,name-listers,dctail-
reporters, video cameras (you get
the point) . . unquestionably
posedalhreat to their privacy. What
you did report about this portion of
the program, that. it included
testimony by victims of sexual
abuse, was all Ihat ”the public”
needs to know.
Thesurvivorsexpressodcourage
inaskingforprivacy,acoumgcthat
was an embodiment of what the
rallystood for. You WERE present
for the greater portion of this tally,
and if you had had any inkling of
understanding of the messages
expressed in the Take Back the
Night movement, you would not
have been so disrespectful, and we

may as well say it, downright
cheesy.

You say, “it should be left to the
discretion ofthemediatodclcrtnine
confidentiality." Come out! Who
are you to decide for survivors of
sexual abuse what parts of their
experience should remain
confidential and what should be
published?? The survivors
explicitly set boundaries to protect
themselves: itw_as their experience
—ITIS THEIR RIGHT. You have
NO right to even question their
valid request for privacy.

In witnessing your unfeelrng
response to an issue that demands
(and they did demand) respect and
sensitivity, thank goodness the
power of discretion was outof your
hands.

B Ferguson Criticizes

"Holier—than-Thou"
Attitude in Editorial

To Ihe editor,

This is in regards to your “staff"
editorial last week criticizing the
“Take Back the Night“ organizers’
requestforallmedialoleaveduring
apart ofthe event. By any chance,
was that editorial the Scarlet and
Black’s attempt at decreasing
apathy on campus by getting us to
tell you how pametic yourargument
was? If so, then congratulations,
your attempt may have worked
better than anything SGA has done
so far about apathy, which to me is
a sad thing. You see, I give SGA a
lot of credit; at least they think
aboutLheiraclionsbeforelheymake
a formal statement, and I‘m not so
sure you have.

Being the award»winning
member of the media that you are,
I’m sure you're aware of issues
going on in ourcountry at this very
moment in which the press has
infringed on the conﬁdentiality of
survivors of sexual abuse by
printing their names without
permission. Some call it honest
reponing of the facts. Others call it
a revictimization of the survivor.

A vast majority of our society
views sexual abuseas the fault of
the victim, not the perpetrator,
which isquitcthcswitch frommost
other Crimes. Publishing the name
of a mugging vrctim or widow/er
due to murderresults in support for
the victim, disdain for the
perpetrator. In the case of sexual
abuse crimes, however, the victim
is perceived as someone who
encouraged it, wanted it. loved it.
The media adds fuel to the fire by
publishing names, pictures and
stories of survivors without
permission.

Maybe the Scarlet and Black is
above that; a real feeling
newspaper thinks about its readers
and its stories. Maybcyouwouldn‘t
have found the need to cover that
pan of “Take Back the Night"
maybe you would have covered the
rest of the newsworthy cvent.
Obviously, I‘m wrong on this; you
had this very opportunity andchose
not to act on it.

While you pine away in your
bitter, “we‘ve been so wronged"

state of mind, think about just how
hard it was for people to talk about
their experiences with sexual abuse
even in frontofthesupponive crowd
that showed up. They were doing
just what the event was intended
for; they were “taking back their
nrght.“

Then, understand that all of the
campus wasn't there for various
reasons: they had to study, they
wanted to watch “McGyver,” or
justpossibly,theydon’tsupportthe
cause. So, you publish the name or
picture of a survivor, and then this
survivor has to walk through
campus daily or go to class labeled
as “the sexual abuse vrctim” by
those unsupportive of the cause'.7 I
think not. I think this person knows
that the crowd that attended that
Monday night event was a
supportive crowd, and this person
is guaranteed thathis/her“label." if
you will,on campuswill remain the
same until s/he changes it,» and-'not
because your p'aper foibed another
public identity down his/her throat
before s/he was ready for it.

I am an incest survivor; I am
statingsoin yourpnnltcnuon. What
this means, in effect, is thatanyone
in town who reads your paper can
read that I am an incestsurvivor. as
well as the faculty, staff.
administrallon and even the alumni
in Boston (or where have you) who
bother to pay your subscription
costs. This admission of’mlnc,
however, is my choice to “come
out,“ and my choice alone; not the
choice of some editorial board
deciding how catchy my story is.

I am absolutely disgusted with
your editorial on this issue,
disgusted with your holler-thanr
thou attitude toward the student
body, and disgusted that you found
the need to turn a powerful,
emotional event into some ”first
amcndmcntrights" issueinslead of
doing thejob you assigned yourself
to do, which was cover the news of
thiscampus. Itleavcsmewondenng
if the same editorial would have
been published had one of your
editors been on thatpanel ofsexual
abuse survivors.
