War Poll Flayed-e
S’ruclen’rs Slackers,
Says Texas Eclil'or

AUSTIN, TEX4(ACF)7A war
poll at the University of Texas

brought forth the charge on the
part of a Texas newspaper editor
that if the results reflected real
campus sentiment, it branded
present»day students as slackers.

The poll, in which 61.8 per cent
of the students who answered
said they wouldn't volunteer for
war to invade some other countiy,
was defended by student officials
and the Daily Texan who chal-
lenged critics to investigate it.
They maintained that it reflected
expressions of only two or three
per cent of the men students, and
doesn’t “make slackers" out of
these.

Jake Pickle, student associa-
tion president, said that the poll
does not show a refusal of stu—
dents to fight in defense of the
country an that “it is a perverted
sense of patriotism that attempts
to foster wan students, like oth-
er citizens, don’t want war."

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

BY WELLS BARNETT

The hlislrethau season begins to
draw to its end, The Pioneers
now find themselves with six Con—
ference Wins» against five losses
and with three loop battle yet
to play. if those three games
are won, Ciinncll Will have a
good record to show for the year
and will probably wind up around
fourth or in a tie for third

place.

But those three giimos arc ga-
ing to be no cinches. The first
one will he with Wnshhurn,
traditionally the Valley pushover,
next Monday. Don'L get the idea
that this year Washhurn will he
a soft touch. It is a far tougher
hall cluh than either St, Louis or
Washington, both of which were
very dangerous here this weekend

2 a , -

u'nshhiirii now stands in a tie
for fifth place with Creighton.
Getting off to a slow start with a
new coach and with one of their-
stars missing, they have exper-
ienced a remarkable change of
form in their last two games, and
have ridden over hoth Tulsa and
Creighton, hoth regarded for a
while as potential championship
material.

Naturally Crinncll will Tuwe the
advantage of its own feor in that
game but it begins to seem that
the advantage is highly overrated.
Regardless of the size of the floor
and other extraneous conditions.
it is the team that plays the
game best that will win. Again,
as in other games this year, care
must be taken that complancy
does not lead to a needless loss,

Probably the Pioneers‘ toughest
task, howcvcr, will he taking
care of Creighton on its own floor
at Omaha. it is true that the
Jays trails Grinnell by a full
game, but the fact remains that
they have heatcn us once this
far on our floor, and that they
\\Ill have the advantage of their
own fullvsize floor, which is ado
mirnhly suited to their style of
play,

However, ii the Pioneers are
right that night, the Cl ghton
floor can he suited to their style
of play as well. Creighton can

he beat at home, and Grinncil can

 

do itiif they will.

Women Postpone Final
Tennequiot Match

Finals in the women's intra-
mural tenniquoit tournament be-
tween Jane Charlesworth and
Mary Frances Hall has been post-

poned until later this week, ac-
cording to Betty Carlson, intra-
mural captain.

’—
Iaist, but far from least im-

portant, is the Drake game at
Grinnelt Having seen quite a few

l‘Dralre games, we won't even
bother to analyze this one, bee
cause it would he meaningless.
Any Drake game is played under
a great tension because of the
long rivalry hetween the two
schools. The team which can
stasd up under that tension the
longest without cracking will win
that game. The best we can do
is hope that the Pioneers, with

two years of a.
team, have acquired enough poise
so that they can force Drake to

experience as

crack.
