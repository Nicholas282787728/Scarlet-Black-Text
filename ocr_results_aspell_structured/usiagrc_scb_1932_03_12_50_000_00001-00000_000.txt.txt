Quotes Milton
on Move Here

wrote Tiffany Blake, chief cdito ‘ul
writer for the Chicago Tribune, t‘n ~
week concerning the removal of chi
Tribune from tho Grinncll college li-
brary. This statement was included
in a letter to a Grinncll alumnus who
forwarded a number of comments on
the situation to the Tribune editorial
staff,

“The late Mr. John Milton covered
the matter, I think, in his Areopag-
itica," the editorial writer continued,
“but perhaps that classic is not used
in the Grinnell classroom. I am
amused, however, by the repetition of
the word, bias, in the comments you
sent us. Bias is the other tcllow's
point of View,"

The Daily lllini, University of Illi-

of the Tribune from the library here
editorially March 1. The editorial
concerning the action is reprinted in
