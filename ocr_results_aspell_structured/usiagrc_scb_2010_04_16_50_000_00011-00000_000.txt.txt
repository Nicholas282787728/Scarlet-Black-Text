Dear “Shocked"

As far as Dcpo-Provera goes, your problem is not unique.
In clinical trials for the birth control shot, over 2/3 ofwomen
gained an average otfive pounds in the ﬁrst year. and contine
ued to gain about 3.5—4 pounds each year following However,
the shot does offer certain advantages that other birth control
methods do not offer. For example, the shot is used only once
every three months. Also, the pregnancy rate among inject-
able birth control users is less than one percent due to limited
chances for incorrect usage. While the shot does not protect
against HIV or other STIs, its birth control effects begin as
soon as the first shot is taken,which is not true for other meth
ods (notably, the birth control pill).Another downside ofusing
the shot is that women may lose significant bone mass density
with extended (more than two years) use.

Birth control pills can also cause some side effects, although
they are less common than the weight gain seen in Depo-Pro-
vera. These include nausea, headaches, breast tenderness and
irregular bleeding. Every pill is different, so it is hard to predict
how each pill will affect any one person’s body, so you need to
work with your doctor to find the best {it for you.

Birth controls have also been reported to decrease sex drive
(because who doesn't love a good dose of irony?), but this has
been neither supported nor refuted with clinical studies. The
great thing about birth control pills is that there so many kinds
that there should be one that works well without causing these
unpleasant side effects. Also, when taken properly, the pills are
more than 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy

The diaphragm, while not a commonly used method of
birth control nowadays, has very few reported side effects,
These can include bladder infections and allergic reaction to
the spermicide on the diaphragm. Additionally, diaphragms

must be ﬁtted at a clinic, adding extra inconvenience.

Other options include intrauterine devices (IUD) and the
Implanon, both of which offer longrterm protection against
pregnancy (up to 12 years for IUD, 3 years for Implanon), but
can be more inconvenienr.The Implanon requires a minor sure
gical procedure to insert and remove and can cost 3400650.
IUDs can cause infections, especially in women with multiple
partners.

so, essentially, cvcry method ofbirth control has advantagcs
and disadvantages. What's important

have an infection, or even at the start ofany sexual relationship,
infection or no) is going in with your partner to get tested for
STIs. That way, you can know if either of you has invited an
unwanted third party to your sexual encounters. Chlamydia can
be treated and cured with antibiotics.

It is important to note that these sympotms are not sure-
fire signs that you have Chlamydia (nor is a lack of symptoms
a SUIB’fH’B sign that you don’t). These symptoms are common
among several STIs, most notably gonorrhea. The only way to

 

is that you find a method that is com-
fortable and convenient for you. Ifyou
want any further information, talk to
your doctor, stop by the SHIC, or set

Dear “Chlammy”:

While your friend is correct, unusual discharge is a com-
mon symptom of Chlamydia, there is no need to panic just yet.
Vaginal discharge is quite normal, and in fact is a natural re»
sponse to help clean and prevent infections. However, nn “unr
usual dischargeLthat is, a discharge that is colored (not clear
or white) ofhas a smell ofconsistency that is abnormal for you
personally~that is something that could definitely be either
Chlamydia or another STI. Chlamydia is an ST] that can be
contracted by both males and females, and the symptoms can
vary rroin person to person. Common symptoms include un-
usual discharge from the penis or vagina, burning during urir
nation, and pain/bleeding during sexual intercourse. However,
some people do not show any symptoms at all, even if they
have the infectionThc best thing you can do (ifyou think you

Cultivating diversity in the modern world

As most ofyon probably already know, the world is losing
linguistic and cultural diversity at an incredible rate. This is
largely because of massive changes in lifestyle in many socie
cries in the world associated with the shift from subsistence
farming to market farming, manufacturing and the service
sector. It is also however, partially due to mass media and state
coercion.

The loss of the smallest languages do not worry me so
much—that may be inevitable and in some ways necessary
for industrialization. The median language has only 7,500
speakers,which is obviously impractical in the modern world.
However, I think languages offive million plus people are sut-
ficiently large to be efficient, since there could still be large
cities within the region where it is spoken. For example swiss
German is secure in its exis-
tence because of the strong
Swiss feelings of identity. it is
used in all spheres of life (en
cept in the mass media and in
school where standard Ger-
man is taught) in spite of the
fact that it has only around
four to five million speakers,

It is the potential loss of
these relatively large languages that worry me because it has
dire implications for the future ofcultural diversity (forwhich
linguistic diversity is a proxy) Swiss Germans neighbor to the
north, Low Alcmannic has largely been replaced by standard
Germanilargely because of rho suppression of it in school
plus the lack ofLow Alcmannic feelings of .dcntity

These things can be changcd, but will ultimately be H”
relevant if these languages have to compctc with bc'heinoth
languages that have more than 100 million speakers due to
either recent (in the last 500 years) conquests of huge areas
(Mandarin Chinese“, English, Portuguese and Russilln) or
recent population explosions due to the incredible yields of
wet rice production using modern technology (Hindi, Bengali
and Japanese). In the absence or mass media and government

coercion, the areas ofretent conquest would be slowly diver-

ing culturally. In 1 ,000 years, Latin diversified into dor
ens oflanguages (French, occitan, Spanish, Venitian, Italian,
etc.) As we can see trom Japan, populations that experience
massive population explosions tend to reverse this
trend and shrink after they become highly devel-
oped and quality of life (ie. not living crammed
really close together) becomes more important to
people.

What am I proposing then? For one, far less
restrictive language policies. In the cases of mega
languages (which are inherently mutually intelligie
ble within themselves), people should be allowed to
write how they talk. On TV and radio they should
talk like the people in their
region talk rather than effecting an
artiﬁcial standard. I do not know how
much languages would diversity in
these conditions because of increased
day to day contact with people from
other rcgions in the modern world. At
the very least though, we should not
try to prevent diversification of lane
guages that already dominnte vast ar-
ens with drab uniformity.

My second suggestion is more controversial and is one
which I am mysclfnot so sure aboutThat is to split the large
est countries in the world into smaller ones and combine the
smaller ones into conglomerations (such as \’ugoslavin).Thc
idea behind this would be partially to create stronger feelings
oi‘separate identity within big countries which could :iicour»
age the creation of separate identities and to incrcnsc effi-
ciency by reducing bureaucracy and separate sets of laws in
the small countries.

Another good reason for splitting up big countries is that
ifthc government ota large country makes n major mistake, it
has massive repercussions. 20 million people died under Sm-
hn because there were hundreds of millions ofpcople in the
Soviet Union, Although these catastrophes were both created
by totalitarian regimes, there is no guarantee that they could
not happen in a democracy—a nuclear war could have easily
broken out over Cuba, had Kennedy not stayed cool. Also,

 

/ suggest that large wunmei
be broken up by popular vale. In
the tennis, prop/e WtJU/d be asked
to rate Lid/titer)! count/es in the or
tier of how muth a person would
want to be m a country with them.

democratic governments can dissolve into despotic ones, such
us with Napoleon and Hitler.

Also, for hundreds of years China was shut oil" from the
rest of the world because ofthe mistence ofa giant state.This
changed China from the most techs
nologically adwinced region of the
world to n backwater. Had China
instead been divided into smaller
countries (as Europe was), there
could have been some countries
open to outsiders and some not. As
the closed Chinese countries had
seen the success of the open ones,
they might have changed to become
open as well. Columbus first lobbied
the Portuguese king for funds, then
the Doges of Genoa and Venice before reaching success with
the King otspain. Had Europe been under one King and if
he had said no, Europeans would have taken centuries longer
to stumble upon America.

I suggest then that large countries (such as the U.S.) be
broken up by popular vote. In the census, people would be
asked to rank adjacent counties in the order of how much a
person would want to be in a country with them, A compute
er could then find the natural breaks and divide the count
try (such as the US.) into chunks between 25 and 50 million
people (nn arbitraiy number, but the mean population of .i
nation state in the world todiy is 33 million, so why not?)This
process might be repeated every hundred ycuis, since cultural
afﬁnities change, Naturally, free (lads and travel would still
exist between those countrics like in the EU, in order to pre
serve economic efﬁciency, We could then have English divert
sify into 10 to so difteient languages and unique cultures in
the US, over hundreds of years which would make life more
interesting and meaningful whilc still maintaining our mate-
rial wellbeing

Interestingly, this is already happening with American
dialects, which are differentiating from each other naturally
among all but the highest classes, who are highly mobile. My
suggestions would however make it happen faster and perhaps
to a higher level ofdiversity than would happen without them.
