A large crowd braved the storm last
Tuesday eiening to hear Marguerite
Kalil '15, who gave a piano recital in
Herrick, chapel. ' s Kalil was assist
ed by Royal Duelrworth, tenor.

The program was varied and well
arranged, tour groups being interpret-
ed. The Beethoven “Sonata on. 31a,"
whicii made up the ﬁrst group, was
playe with terror. The number was
heaiitil'uily melodic and the rendition
was almost professional.

The second group consisted ot three
numbers in a lighter mood. The para-
phrase air a waltz from the operetta,
“Tile hat," by Striailsseschuett, was the
most popular number on the pro.
gram. The theme or this nuinher was

‘ , stiggcstiie of the title. \l'ss
Kalil displayed great ability in her In-
terpretation, both train a technical anti
tonal standpoint.

The meal numbers were greatly up»
preciatetl. Mr. Ducltwurtli has a very
ﬂexible voice. H‘ tones were accu—
iaie and he po - a wide range.
