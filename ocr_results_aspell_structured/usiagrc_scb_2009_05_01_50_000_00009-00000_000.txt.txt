The decor and schedule ol'hdnds matched the
reputation othw orlcans, though it was a lits
tle too clean.Theii beer and Liquor selection was
comparable to most lowa bars, but with pricas
closer to that of the Big Easy. The atmosphere
strove for lli‘bﬂn’l'llp. but needed work. This
is best represented by the candle at our table.

A place with pitclitrs, professors and real cnlr

State Street SHE

It was basically like ASLM, replete with odd
paraphernalia, but with booze. You could probs
ably live hereidi ink liltc into the night and roll
over to Ach for the perfect cura to‘a hangover.
This was the one bar we were a little tempted to
see more of, not only because orthc :lfoiemcn-

just Budweiser, cheap bar food, pool tables, and

photographs, deep iricd food, and baby in the
bar made us feel more patriotic every minute we
spent there,

Sidcnaclrs, Kellogg ‘3‘

Upon entry, nearly every member
tablishrncnt looked ovcr to us in momentary
silence. Clearly they were unused to new cus-
tomcrs. The bartender immediately checked all
ofout lbs, and forced the nonsdrinlung people
to sit separately from the drinking folkﬂn u“,
orthodox, and some would say, dickish move.
However, they had a really cool pitcher with
ice on the side, which kept the boar cold.A guy
at the bar told us that the people at the bar up
thc strcct, our ncxt destination, were not cool
because they kicked him out for smelling like
weed. A couple of men who could easily have
been our fathers creepily checked out the womr
cn in our group, heralding our departure.

RJ's Bar and Grill, Kellogg EEBBE

The best place we visited, hands down. Unlike
Sidctraclcs, we rcccivcd a friendly greeting from
the patrons of Rj's. Here we met Kellogg pcrs

The host thing about this placc was thc poster

in thc nicn‘s room that read: “15 reasons why
beer is better than women,’Y Included on this
list wcrc, “beer can always give good head,"
“bccr will ncvcr complain if you grab anothcr
onc,” and “a bccr is always wct." At this point
in oul drunken travels, this artwork grabbed
the majoiity ofour attention and we missed out
on anything else that could have been of inter
est, Clearly our journalistic rigor was eroding

quickly

“What the fuck are you guys doing here?" was
the ﬁrst welcome we received from a fellow pa-
tron. Undeterred, Neal still managed to strike
up a conversation with our new drunken and
slightly belligerent friend, ﬁnding out such facts
as,“the only one that really loves me is my dog."
Still, the beer was decent (Fat Tire) and cheap
ish. In general, we didn't really interact with
anybody licrc—wc huddlcd togcther in our
own corner, bemoaning our collcctivc struggle
to down the pitcher.

Eaglos Club ﬁ'ﬁ .

We were psyched about this place. An onlrne
review we read earlier in the week sratcd among
othcr things: “Great bar, Great old guys. Cheap
beer. Don’t go ifyou are a stereotypical Gtinnell
hippie vegan. We don't need your kind in here.
Stay on campus or at least on your side of West
St. However, it'you are a college student that
loves living right and being free, welcome. This
is where the heroes congregate." Instead otlogs
cndary Americans, we found a mostly crnpry
bar. Perhaps the heroes must have turned in car—
ly that night. We don't really remember much
from the bar, but ﬁeld notes indicate extreme
support for Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “can't You Smell
That Smell?"

Gametime FEET. *

This point in the night was akin to the point
in which a marathon runner begins to feel their
legs beginning to drop out beneath thcm. still,
we all drank a token amount. Neal's notes are
nearly incomprehensible, but we can glean some
details from the historical recordThey had Am
imal Planet on the lone TV, which was really
cool.The man watching it tmly seemed to care
about biology Luckily, the bartender was sup-
portive ofour quest and encouraged us get out
oftl-ic bnr early so that we could stumble across
thc highway to Rabbirt's before closing time.

The task of a historian is difﬁcult. The task of
a person reconstructing previous drunken ad-
ventures is monumental in comparison. For that
reason, we will simply givc thc rradcr pieces of
our raw notes, to let him/her best piece together
what happened.

“80% more heavy metal than other bars."
“Ooh! Cheap beer on Sundays."

“On a scale from 1 to schwastywc are at 27."
“The pope says condiments do not prcvcnt

AIDS,"

Danish Maid FRESH
Every story deserves its own happy ending, Afr
tcr caring ketchup and mustard at Rabbins, we
raced over to the bakery to get the day’s ﬁrst
batch ofbakcd goods. They were the best do-
nuts we had our baton. The End.
