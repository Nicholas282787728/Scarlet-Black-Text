Late in the evening of line 17th. 1882, Grin-
nell was visited with desolation and death. Thir-
tyAnine persons were killed and one hundred and
twenty-ﬁve were wounded. Destruction and dev—
asta’r; u was the great imprint left in the wake of

‘ of the three great cyclones that visited

the quiet town of Grinnell and the beautiful cam—
pus of Grinncll College.

Shortly before sunset, Saturday evening,
June 17th, 1882, the northern sky was hung with
conical. downward—pointing clouds and seemed to
brood trouhe for quiet and inoffensive Grinnell.
While darkness was gathering, the western hori»
zon and western sky half way to the zenith were
lurid and ominous. Brilliant fringed clouds crept
slowly and seemed to stretch their unearthly ﬁn~
g‘ers over the town with a greedy desire to fasten
thvir talons on the peaceful villagers below. The
llcdcons sight was fascinating, while it ﬁlled them
is '” ill-defined dread. Before the brilliant appa~
.‘1 on in the west had disappeared, the terrible
storm cast its grip of death and devastation. It
was accolllpa ‘cd by a roaring likened to deafen—
in 0‘ thunder of perhaps more like the droll rum-

g of a dozen hczivy freight trains. Houses,
barns, chimneys, bricks and trees began to ﬂy like
withered autumun leaves. Wagons and carriages
‘11)d occasionally horsesﬁwerc seen rambling
thru the highly sensit zed atmosphere. - .

Rain came in floods, as if a rater spout haz
suddenly burst (which, in fact, was probably the
case). Wim. rain and 1313 iding lightning contin-
ued so furiously that it was unsafe for those whosrl
roofs protected them, to open any door of their
homes. It took but ﬁve minutes for this raging;
demon of Nature to leave its touch of devastation

and death. The northwest section of G-rinnell was .

razed to the ground. The path of thestorln was
comparatively narrow. Not an object was left
Untouched in its wake. The fury of the storm lllzls
terriﬁc in the portion of Grinncll north of Fifth
avenue. The block directly opposite Alumni Reci-
tahion Hall was left a mass of twisted trees and
splil‘lt- -ed homes.

The cyclone entered Grinnell from the wes!
and movd a little north of east until it reach l
Main street. It then curved to the south east,
swooping down upon the college campus, sweep-
ing the building‘s off like chaff. It romped thru
the east part of town,lleaving a wake of ruin. It
met a westbound Rock Island freight train, greet—
ing it rather roughly and leaving Wheels, splin~
tel-ed box cars and merchandise decorating the
surrounding landscape. It entered the village of
Malcom, eight miles east of Grinnell, and made a
hurried exit—with most of Malcom following dis-
jointedly by the air-route.

shortly nflm"i,lll> llillilsll'llpllv relief trains were hurried to
oi-imwll. bringing food and nmney. Mom-y pollltld into lln- sfl'ickcll
