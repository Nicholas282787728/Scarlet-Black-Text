Professor Cecil F. Lavell, ot the hi

tn ng to the soldiers at Camp Dodge.
He was sent to the camp as the repr-
sentative or the American Historical
Society, acting under general instruc-
tions trorri Washington,

During the week Professor Lavell
gave two series of lectures. One, colts
sisting of ten lectures dealing with the
historical background or the war, was
given to a group or some forty men
who are being trained for Y. M. C, A.
hut work at the front. These men are
in close contact with the soldier-s, and

“The whole idea. is to make the hay-
onets think.” That is, to make the
men ﬁght, not merely because their
country is at war, but because they
iicel that the cause is worth ﬁghting
tor, and with this to make them tool
that their allies are true brothers in
arms.

"Incidentally," said Professor Lovell,
“the camp nrsdc a most iavorablc 1n]—
pression. 1 did not see a loarer while

the whole place looked like a well or-

simply soldiers, but citizens. Apart
altogether irorn the war, the mcn are
being trained in a thousand ways [or

“CHRIS \S GIFTS SHOW
GREAT SPIRIT"7HOLLOWAY

The rollowing paragraph was taken
from a letter written by Paul Homo,
way. ext-'18, who is now stationed at
Deming, N. M, in the medical corps or
the National Guard.

“Grinnell has shown a great spirit
tliru this critical period, and the gifts
to the men at Christmas time revealed
to the men in training that there was
a real bond or sympathy between them
and the students or the dear old
school."

Philip Kelieher is now in Camp
Dodge, where he is enrolled as a moms

1n illustrating the case of Belgium,
the speaker gave “the Red Cross paras
hie." An English army otticcr, during
the German advance tliru Belgium,
rushed into a house where an English
nurse was caring for
wounded, warning her to escapc.
When she refused, he insisted that a
Red Cross dag be hung out. As there
was no nag available, he tore up a
sheet for the wlritc background, and,
lacking red cloth, lie dipped two strips
of white cloth into a pool or blood
wherc the stretcher had been placed,
and crossing them upon the torn
shoot, termed a Red Cross dag. “King
Albert," Rcv. Haywood said, “has dips
pod the fabric of humanity into the
blood or the Belgians and his own
blood in order that it might protect
the house of humanity."
