1 would like to mention how
much I enjoyed the truly medr
icval atmosphere of the Boar‘s
Head dinner. I wonder, though,
if it wasn't an oversight to
supply us With eating utensiles.

He wore his hair ”differ—
ently.” he was an ”odd—ball."
I" he was rebelling, why didn‘t
he offer anything constructive
with which to replace our con—
formist society?

Aside from the fact that
chrything the US and Grinncll
stand for can be summed up in
“individual freedom short of
physical harm to another” and
anyone has the right to live
anyway he pleases within the
one limitation, there is a pos—
itive good from even a comple—
tely negativistic dissent.

And the value is simply to
rm ‘nd us that there are other

to live ind those of us
w thin SOCiﬂtg’S bounds of ”ac—
Coptance" may be all wrong about
everything.

It seems to he that there is
something deeply wrong with peo—
ple who don’t see acts of vigil—

groups in their true light—
, n all the impli( ions as
for as civilization and govern—
ment are concarned.

Beyond this, of what Value

reading John Stuart Mill (as
almost everyone at Grinnell has
done) if what he says means no-
thing when ”‘the guys" decide
someone is wrong for being dif—
ferent —— and since legal means
can‘t correct the problem, ma ks
and gangs can.

What kind of an education
his oomeons gained from a lib—
oral arts institution if he can
say "sure it was wrong, but it
had to be done?"

Aside from rntionalizations,
why was his hair clipped, guys?
Because you envy his freedom?
because you're scared he might
be liVing in the way which will

sunk?

Society requires a certain
amount of conformity, agreed.
But a few out—and~out noncon—
formists make the rest of us
take stock of our ideas, atti—
tudes and prejudices ~~ and
this is also extremely neces—
sary.

To the Editor:

With regards to the shearing
of a student, I would like to go
on record as being against mob
violence; there is no justifica—
tion for this type of action and
it is decidedly non—constructivr.
In this instance a certain type
of ”mob violence“ has served to
focus the attention of the cam—
pus upon an issue that has be—
come a popular coffee topic.

I em speaking about a small
group known as ”heathiks.” Al—
though our society is not perfect,
there are certain standards by
which we live Among these are
cleanliness d hygiene.

What g c' this small minority
the right to dress in such an ut—
tcrly despicable manner when they
are representing a group that
doesn‘t condone it. Why should tn
campus be subjected to ignomy and
notoriety without reason?

Tet us not forget that f1 dom
of the individual has restrictions.
We hove freedom to act as we wi h
as long as we do not infringe upon
the rights of others. In my opin—
ion there is within this group
that cries for their freedoms to
think and act as they please, lit—
tle regard for the rights of those
who may tend to think differently.
