“Empty Heart”

by Kathryn Thurber

Joshua Zim's “Empty Heart," written
almost a decade ago, is finally receiving
the acclaim it deserves, Published by
Phantom Court Press in Boulder, Cole
orado, Zim's collection of very short
stories attacks everyday modern Inc with
the ancient wisdom of the Zen Buddhisls.
Titles of his one-page masterpieces in
clude “communicable disease," “tribe,"
and ”Wind." With paintedly allusive titles
and plots, Zim creates a somewhat
cacophonic collection at modernrday
satire.

Obviously enraptured with the spiritual
messages of Boulder and. more specifical-
ly, ot the Naropa Institute (of Buddhist
Studies), Joshua Zim writes of gods. In
“communicable disease,” one is overcome
with images of incense, oil, and what Zim
himsell deems as “all sorts of divine odds

and ends," overcrowding his stories with ,

paraphernaliac detail, Zim hopes to define
a spiritual path in the 19805. Unfortunate-
ly, the path often becomes a maze Zim
tails to capitalize any titles, creating even
more dead ends in the spiritual maze. In
stead at giving purpose to his seemingly
unimportant titles, he grovels in die trenr
ches oi modern technique.

Despite Zim's overuse of spirituality and
his iailurc, by sticking to conventions, to
enrich his poetic prose, he is very capable
oi mocking our modern world and presenr
ting a new twist to some conventional
plots In the short story “tribe,” 3 lather is
portrayed, reilectivc, and smoking a
cigarette. He stares at what appears to be
a burn scar between his thumb and {circle
inger. While his son is not looking, he puts
his cigarette out in the same place on the
young boy’s hand. His ending remark,
“Don't trustanybody.” depicts the irony of
society today and provides the necessary
realism of ancient Buddhism.

Although Zim’s realism borders on
audacity, his sketches entertain the reader
and are endearing to students oi Budr
dhism. With the story “wind," as with the
stories ‘fire" and “bees," natural
elements abound Employing beautiful
simplicity in the old folk tradition, Zim ex-
plains the wind as the cries at a simple
woman.

A collection ior those with an empty
heart or a mind for modern satire. “Emp-
iy Heart” encompasses the cries oi a sim-
ple man.

Mixed review of
photography exhibit

by Julee Brown

An exhibition in the Grinliell Community
Art Gallery oi photographs by Paul
Beaver, a photo-journalist native to Grinr
nell, closed today. This retrospective span-
ned Beaver’s entire career, from his in
ternship with the Grinnell Herald-Register
in the mid»1960s to his participation in a
1982 Pulitzer-Prize-winning photographic
essay on Mississippi public education for
the Jackson Clarion-Ledger.

Also highlighting the exhibition is a
:group or photographs which portray black
iarm workers in the Mississippi Delta and
for which Beaver was a finalist in the

Pulitzer competition. The portraits from .

these two acclaimed series are expressive
and poignant without being sensational,
while the daily-life genre scenes
realistically depict the continuing ex-
ploitation of black Southern, farm
laborers.

Unfortunately, Beaver‘s profound

human-interest photographs comprise on
1y part of this exhibition; the remainder
exempliﬁes the sensationalism, technical
trickery, and lrivolity of photojournalism
at is worst. in a highly un»newsworthy in»
vasion of privacy, Beaver depicts a recent
amputee as she comforts her grieving
mother trom the hospital bed. There are
several specialeffecLs photographs, the
most contrived being a multi-exposure
rendering of Michael Jackson's ‘Thriller”
album shown encased in a ﬂaming block of
ice. Finally, Beaver demonstrates a ﬂair
for the cliche in his photographs of
children; repesentative is “Messy Face,"
a portrait series of an annoyingly cute
baby at ieeding time. ‘

“Paul Beaver: “Photographs” is an ex-
hibition of inconsistent quality, comprised
of boﬂi second-section ﬂuff and substantial
photo-journalistic reporting, a combina
tion which, at least, makes tor a good
study break.
