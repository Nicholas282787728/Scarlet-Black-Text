Sticks and Stones

_ ‘ By Paul nass

Traditionally, the Christmas version oi this column has been
devoted to a savage diatribe against Ame-icon advertising, culture
and shoddy values. in years past we hale read about the evils of
thinking men's cigarettes, leading depilaiories, tail—finned cars and
hloeked-up bowels. We have deplored window decorations of the
Woolworth ilk, gift decanters and JLIM. about everything Christ-
masy but pine trees and snow.

Christmas. The very charm of
the season is that it is FELT,
not thought about: it is en-

two each year, to wish that

To the Editor:

Each year at this rather fes-
tive time at Grinnell, thatwhich
I think is our most striking
anomaly comes home to me in
full force. That is, the singing
of Christmas Carols. A blanket
of music and song settles on the

mas songs instead of Christ-
mas carols The word “carol"
actually means “praise" or
“celebration.“ Who are we
praising? What are we cele-
hratlng?

Are We not being intellectual—

 

We wish you '01
MERRY CHRISTMAS

But how many of us are
deeply convicted ahout the
ideas expressed in the carols?
D0 we even think about
them while we sing at the top
of our lungs? Probably most
of us would not he caught

life to that which we sing so
heartily. Beliefs basic to the
carols (God‘s sovereignty,
Christ’s divinity, original sin
and Satan) are ior the most
part worn out; but the mel-

tunes that touch the sentiment

do we not change the words;
