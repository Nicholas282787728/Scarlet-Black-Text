3.5 0r Bust!

Three weeks ago, we urged a revision of Lhepgradlng system
to allow for intermediate grades within the rigid_A, B, c, D
framework. The Committee on Student-Faculty ftelatrons was con—
currently considering a similar plan, as was the faculty. Student
Council approved the report to the committee and referred it _to the
faculty’s March a meeting. At that meeting, proposals linking
2.5 and 3.5 grades as well as the 2,5 alone were defeated. Grading
is to be considered at a ”later date" when the entire curriculum
is re—evaluated.

Faculty and administration concern has also been aroused
by ”grade inﬂation" for it is felt that an unusually large number
of A’s and B’s are given on this campus. Methods oi correcting
inflation are .now being considered, including a. pneposal to
tighten grade distribution.

The rejection of the ”plus” grades effects the students alone
for it is only their records that are inﬂuenced. True, there are
many who do not look forward to such a system but these are
the students who now “inflate" the higher grade brackets.

on the other side of the coin, it is obvious that, under pos-
sible stricter distribution of grades, the students who will be hurt
will be those now in the A»B grouping and, unfortunately, it is
those students who will be going on to graduate school and who
need the highest grades they can earn. Why recommend a cessation
of inflation without taking the first logical and fair step toward

curing the ill?
“Ah Tickelless"

"Ah Wilderness” tickets are among the most prized possessions
on campus this week, Many students who signed the little pink
slips distributed in their mail boxes have found that there is no
room for them in the Arena theatreefcr any of the perofrmances.
They tend to be disappointed and perhaps a wee bit irate that no
tickets are available.

Somewhere along the budgeting line, the money used to
finance the performance must come out of every student‘s pocket.
Thus every student should be given the opportunity to see what
he has invested in.

Two years ago, we are told. “Dark of the Moon” was given,
arena—style, in the Women’s Gym. We are also told that the per—
formance was highly successful and that all those desiring tickets
were accomodated, Could this be a solution to the present problem7

SCARLET AND BLACK

Sticks
and
Stones

By Paul Kass

Last weekend, choosing to
forego the chaos in Darby, 1 at.
tached myself to a group of
Grinnellians, students and fac—
ulty, who were traveling to the
State University of Iowa, there
to tour the university theater
and see their production of
Frederico Lorca’s “Blood Wede
ding." It was a rewarding jaunt.

The physical setup at Iowa
is simply fantastic. Every
conceivable piece of modern
stage machinery is installed in
their theater, from a massive
revolving stage that changed
sets in 34 seconds to a light
control hoard that looked like
the dashboard of a 3-52.

They have the works: a stage
some 30 feet wide and 42 deep,
backed with a huge, unwrlnkled
cyclorama which perfectly simv
ulates a background “sky," and
a double set of track running
irom wings to stage center, for
rolling sets on and off the res
volve. They have a scene shop
the size of Poweshiek county.
and a marvelous frame-like de
vice which raises and lowers
backdrops, enabling crews to
paint the entire thing without
mounting a ladder. ,

They have plush, upholstered
seats. each of which offers a
perfect sight line to the stage, a
three—turntable hiefi setup, a
theater lounge that rivals our
Younker, a stock of over 3000
costumes from every period, and
a custom of not merely record-
ing, but actually filming every
university production.

They have just about every-
thing. And, for three hours,
I was impressed almost to the
point of paralysis. Neither
ARK nor the Arena compared
quite favorably . . .i

The awakening came when
the curtain rose on “Blood Wedr
ding." in a trice, all memories
of that grand equipment went
down the drain, as a troupe of
uniformly sophomoric actors,
gesturing like head iinesmen
and chanting like Gregorian
monks, murdered Lorca’s play,

It was at first shocking, and
then ludicrous, and finally bor-
ing: the players, badly made up

Henry Sees Universal Theme
In "Comedy of Recolleciion"

By lton Henry

If you Wish to have your brain cells agitated by deep
thought, if you want to experience the presentation of a
penetrating philosophy, 01' if you merely wish to be excited
by a taut drama that will keep you on the edge of your
seat: don’t go and see the Grinnell Players production of

and wandering around like
wraiths on All Hallows, grimly
slogged their way through it,
never knowing quite what it
was all about, but bent on
carrying it off just the same.

The costuming alone was
passable. The acting was right
out of a Sunday school pag»
cant, and the harsh, unimagin-
ative lighting (thrown by a
monstrous battery of expensive
lights) left the cast in im—
minent danger of being crisp-
ed to death right on stage.
The sets, seemingly effective
during the afternoon‘s tour, in
practice served only to throw
white light back into the aud-

ience’s faces.

Yet not one of the 4DlJ-odd
Iowa students present booed.
hissed, or even squirmed. Dur-
ing the halftime, one was heard
lauding the quality of the show,

All of which is in the way of
saying that revolving stages do
not in themselves make a good
show, and that I am more than
ever proud to be a student at
Grinnell.

This week we are producing
O’Neill in what has been de-
noted the “new" Arena thea-
ter . . , new, in that there
have been installed more-or.
less permanent risers; new, in
that the walls have receivedv
a coat of paint; new, in that

the Arena is slightly less
primitive than before. The
Arena theater is still patheti»
cally crude in comparison with
that at the state university,
still cramped and inadequate.

But I’ll venture to say that
our show is far superior to the
debacle I witnessed last week-
end, for the simple reason that
we possess what they lacked:
talent. And talent, Combined
with the fierce, cardboard—and-
scotch-tape ingenuity of Grin.
nell crews, has more than over—
come our physical and financial
inadequacies.

Three times three for the
drama department boys. Theyre
good!

“Ah Wilderness”. If, however,
you wish to be completely en-
tertained and amused by a
warm, funny play that is no
more eartb—shaking than apple
pie and cheese, but just as deli-
cious and mouthewatering, by
all means see ”Ah Wilderness."
Sneak m if you have to.

Don’t let the by-line of
O’Neill scare you off either.
O‘Neill wrote this play in a
weak moment, at a time when
he wasn’t dwelling on the. ex-
dessive use of symbolism or on
his recurrent theme of “he-
longing," There are certainly
elements of symbolism and
“belonging” iu this play but
they don’t take the overpow-
ering position of importance
that they do in most of
O’Neill's plays.

O’Neill calls this play a ”come
edy of recollection" lbut what
makes it so enjoyable is that it
is not so much a recollection
for O’Neill as it is for us, the
audience. He tells a simple tale
of an adolescent growing into
manhood and we enjoy it be-
cause, in seeing this struggle,
we recollect our own growing
up or that of our brothers and
sisters. O'Neill entertains us by
choosing a theme that is so un-
iversal and all-encompassing
that in Watching the Miller fam-
ily we see our own, and chuckle
as much at our own recollections
as we do at O‘Neill’s,

I strongly suspect that
Thornton Wilder’s“0ur Town"
owes not a little bit to “All
Wilderness," although one must
grant that Wilder used a num-
ber ot gimmicks to give the
old theme a “new look".

With few exceptions this play
represents the finest job of per-
fect casting that has been seen
in a long time. Ideal casting is
naturally difficult at Grinnell
because we don‘t have a large
, student body and worse luck, we
don’t have enough interest on
the part of the students we do
have.

The largest acting bouquet
rnust conclusively go to Bob
Norris, who played the part of
Richard as though it was writ.
ten for him. In the intimate
atmosphere of an Arena pro.
duction it is very easy to occa-
sionally catch an actor mo-
mentarily out of character. If
Bob dropped out of chamter,
I didn’t see it and believe me,
x was watching:

The rest of the cast all did a
fine job and any inconsistencies
which I am now going to record
I can attribute almost entirely

to “opening night Shaka."

A1 Spielez‘ as Nat Miller start-
ed of: rather uncertainly but
improved immensely as the play
progressed. His characterization
