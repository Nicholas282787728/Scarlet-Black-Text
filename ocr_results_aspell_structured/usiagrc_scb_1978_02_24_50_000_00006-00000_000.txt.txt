The Coop comes home

by Nancy Carpenter

I wonder if any film reviewer for
the 5&8 has ever written about a
Gary Cooper movie without
mentioning that the great man is a
Grinnell alumnus7 Who am I tul
break with tradition?

The Coop did attend Grinnell,
leaving without a degree, and, if
you believe the rumors, under
inauspicious circumstances. I find
it funny that a Grinnell dropout
was on one trade magazine’s list of
Top Ten MoneysMakers in
Hollywood for 18 years, but I have
a sick sense of humor.

Cooper appears on campus this
week in the classic anti-Westem
High Noon, ior which he won an
Academy Award, Hollywood didn't
tum out many great films in the
50's, but this is one of the best

Fred Zinneman directs this story
of a sheriff of a small Midwestern
town who plans to hang up his
badge to live happily with his soon-
to»be bride, Grace Kelly, a Quaker
who despises violence, On the
morning ot his wedding day,
Cooper learns that a killer he had
put behind bars is arriving in town

'And a note to trivia bulls: see if

on the noon train, looking for
revenge, Cooper's fearful friends‘
refuse to help him and Kelly vows
she will leave him if he picks up his
guns. The sheriff is forced to stand
alone in defense of law and order.
The situation served as a political ‘
allegory that reflected the state of l
this country in the '50s.

The film’s editing is particularly
good: shots of clocks ticking away
the minutes til showdown, long
shadows, and stark settings con-,
tribute to the buildup of suspense. ‘
Cooper gives a wonderful per
formance as a good man
agonizingly caught in the
machinations of an evil society.

I haven‘t seen the film and don't
know much about it but everyone
who has seen it seems to rave
about it.

At the risk or prompting public
derision from seriouseminded film
critics, let me quote Rex Reed,
Vogue critic, Who writes, “at the
Very center of the film is Glenda
Jackson’s marvelously impartial
performance.” What he probably
means by “impartial" is that
Hedda is a woman of many cun-
flicting land disputed)
motivations.

As a recentlysmarried, up-
perclass Victorian woman, she is
at the same time sexually
repressed, desirous of a hedonistic
life, slightly mad, brilliant,
disillusioned, sardonic, unhappy
with her husband and jealous of his
freedom. Jackson's variety of roles
in her past films makes her a
natural in this demanding one.

This Week marks the first film of
a series of films on Western
European Civilization. Luis
Bunuel, the great Spanish film-
maker, directed Viridiana, winner
of the prestigious Grand Prize at
Cannes in 1961, Immediately after
its release, Franco banned the film
in Spain, citing its outrageous
attacks on religion and society as
his justilication.,The film deals
with the impossiblity oi living a
pure Christian life.

The name Bunuei brings to mind
a variety of images: raped virgins,
fallen saints, grotesque phallic
svmbols, lepers. This film has all
that and more.

Viridiana, on her way to a
convent, stops to visit her rich
uncle, who attempts to rape her
and, tailing, hangs himself in
remorse. Feeling responsible tor
his death, Viridiana remains at his
estate to create a haven for
beggars, lepers, and the crippled,
who eventually take over the house
to stage a wild, drunken orgy. This
scene culminates in a blasphemous
version of the Last Supper, with the
most disgusting beggar playing the
Christ»role.

Burluel uses the shock value of
cruelty and ugliness to show that
man is self-deceiving, his world is
wicked, and that wickedness is
compounded by his delusory
aspirations. He is a master
technician, strongly influenced by
Salvador Dali, and Viridiana is a
parable that is as much a poem as
a film.
