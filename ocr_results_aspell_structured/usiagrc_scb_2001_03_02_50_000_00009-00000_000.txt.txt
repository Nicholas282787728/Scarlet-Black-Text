'Greetings, Earthlings' was already taken

Start time: 1:30 pm.

And now, a quick rruc/falsc guesrion, hopefully
rhe lasr one you'll have to answer hefore rhe weekend.
True or False: The following scenario has happened
ro you:

You, seeing‘one ofyour friends/acquaintances on
your way to class: “Hey, (blank)!"

F r i e n d .

“Hey, (you)!
How are you?"
You: “Well.
. I’ve heen her.

“That's grearl
Talk to you

if you an.
swered “true" to
rhis question,
you're nor alone.

—
The phrase ”How are
you" has devolved ‘
from a question to a
mere rote greeting,
where we expect to
hear one of two
answers: either
"ﬁne" or “not too
bad" (or variants
thereof, including

various gradients of

my friends come grunt).

plain ahour ir _—
rhar 1 can assume
iris a fairly common thing to hrppen ar Grinnell. Ar
rhe risk of sounding cliche, whar we have here is a
failure ro communicate,

The phrase “How are you" has devolved from a
ouesrion w a mere rore greering, where we expecr to
hear one ofrwo answers: either “ﬁne" or “not roo bad"

(or varianrs rhereof, including various gradienrs of

grunr). When we hear somerhing differcnr. such as
an enrhusiasric “grear” or a depressed “nor roo good,"
we may srop ro find our why. More likely. our hrains
have been wired so thoroughly ro espeer one of rhe

rwo responses rhar we filrer our rhe unexpeered re»
sponse so rhar ir hecomes aceeprahle to our hrains.

1 suspccr this is a survival reehnioue, especially
in a place like Grinnell, where our heads are on rhe
verge of exploding anyway. if we aerually heard rhe
nonvcxpccred response, our hrains mighr nor he ahle
ro rake rhe radical change, and hefore you knew it,
rherc would be hirs of gray marrer all over rhe
place, which would make the sidewalks
even more slippery. hailing rhar. our hrains
srill rnighr be confused enough to swireh
rhe meanings ofrhe unexpected responses,
such as assuming “I'm great!" acriially
means “I'm rerrihlel"

Nor is this prohlem merely a
loml one. in my homerown in
Chicago sphurhia, people don't
even wair to respond to your ase

»sessinenr of how you are. hur just

say “how are you" in a monorone and keep on walk.
ing. in other places I’ve lived, rhe expeercd responses
are different- negadvc rarlier rhan posirivo grunrse
our rhe phenomenon is rhe same (they say “sorry to
hear it" insread). And my friend rells me rhar in oer»
rain parts of Mexico, people greer each orher wirh
“hueno” iusr ro get rhe question our ofrhe way.

This will nor do, and especially nor at a school
where we are supposed ro value open communicarion
above all else (well, mayhe rhar “liberal arts :duca»
rion" hir, our who needs rhar?) And afrer all, if we
mn'r effeeiively oommunieare in our greetings, the resr
ofour eonversarions are also ulrimarcly lost. The prob-
lem is rhar alrernare greerings are nor much herrcr.
Consider:

- “what's up?": Since ﬁrst hearing rhis parrieular
greeting in seventh grade, I have srrugglod ro deiera
mine a proper response ro rhis seemingly simple ques»
rion.A1as,afrer several years ofrrying, 1 have come to
rhe eonelusion rhar such a response docs nor exisr.

Even worse is having ro respond ro rhe rejoinder, “Nor a

mueh. you?" Who needs Fermar's LurTl-lcorcm when
you have rhar question to ponder?

thirty minutes or it's free

- “How's ir hanginga": This suffers from rhe same
problem oferpeered response as "How are you," and
comes wirh rhe added honus ofmaking ahsolurely no
sense 1 would love ro hear rhe origin of rhis parricu.
lar phrase, so rhen 1 could srop lying awake nighrs
wondering ahour ir.

-!“H1.You would rhink rhis very simple greet»
ing would he aceeprahle, hur alas, “hi" often brings its
good friend “awkward silence" to rhe eonveisarion as
well while the eonversanrs arrempr ro ger onro a ropie
ofdiscussion. Jusr like a' paper for a class, rhere needs
to he rransirions, and rhis greering hu none.

- “I will nor buy this record, ir is scratched":

Acrually, nomscquirurs mighr he a good way ro
srarr a ronversarion, heeause
you will mosr likely suh.
sequently have ro as
plain whar you're ralk.
ing ahour, and rhar will
ger some hall rolling. However. if you're looking ro
mainrain some semblance of normality, rhis mcrhod
rnighr nor he foryou. (Plus, only Monry Python fans
would ger rhe Joke anyway Never mind.)
so, whar ran we do ahour rho problem? My ine
clinarion is just ro lisren when youasksomehody how
he or she is doing. I rry so do ir, and people seem to
he genuinely appreciarive. i know rhar people here
are in a hurry, rrying ro ger ro elass or a eluh meering
on rhe orher side ofcampus in rhe next 2 minures,
hur it only raises a few seconds. You don'r have ro ger
rheir life srories (although ifyou really don't wanr ro
go ro class, rhar’s a good way of nor gerring rhere).
Jusr a lirrlc response ro show rhar you're acrually lis.
tening and rhar you care ahour rho orher person's life.
1r will hrighren rhar person's day, and prohahly yours,
roo.
Oh, and in ease anyone is wondering, lam perv
sonally reeling great. Thanks for asking.
Srop rime 2:04 p m. well, closer ro rhe mark,
anyway. Nor deliheinrely setting out ro annoy people
is a good way to ger my time down, 1 find.

Now, in nor one ro knock tradition in facr, l’ll

Granred my love of tradirion is conﬁned ro a prerry

This anger would he hased I hclieve, on two renets
hirsr, most of our eoneepnons ofrradirion are ried
up in rhe aforemenrioncd oppressive biases (some
mighr say rhar rhis eonceprion is hiased . . . they'd be
righr). seeond, rarrying rhc lahel of “Conservrrive,
Conforming, Tradirionalisr" really hreaks wirh
Grinnellian rradirion.

Grinnell has a myriad ofrradirions to honor and
rhe eampus community is deadvset on honoring rhem.
Mosr ofrhese are. ofeourse, enrerrainmenr/parry re.

Also coming up isTirular Head which, though

solidified rhe iradirion even more, though to he fair,
