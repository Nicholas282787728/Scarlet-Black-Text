I A new Grinnell?

This is admittedly a real twist but we feel compelled to scold John
Hopkins and his admissions department not for failing to do their job ~
but for doing their job too well.

“Get out there and sell Grinnell,“ was the order (we assume) that
Hopkins issued to his troops and sell they did. According to Hopkins, 418
new students arrived here this semester, up from the figure of 403 that
he gave to President George Drake, Executive Vice»President Waldo
Walker and Dean of Student Affairs Jim Tederman in late June.

So what‘s the big deal'.7 Fifteen students here or there can’t makeithat
much difference, right? WRONG. The overcrowding that has ensued
has totally changed the tenor of the Grinnell campus,

On page seven of the 1981782 Grinnell College Catalog die following
statement appears under the heading of “Campus Life:”

To complement its curriculum, Grinnell offers a residential life designed to
provide full opportunity for personal development. Again, as with the cur-
riculum, students benefit from the opportunites that small numbers offer for
open exchange of ideas and opinions in residence halls as well as classrooms.

Well, that’s just not the case at Grinnell right now. Forcing new
students to live in off-campus housing where they are far from dorms
and the rest of the students isn’t providing the ideal atmosphere “for
open exchange of ideas.” As for the returning students, they have come
back to a Grinnell that can’t offer as many small, quiet dinners in PDRs
or a lounge to escape to because they no longer exist.

We can only imagine what it would be like if Hopkins had to send out
his troops to sell a school that may offer isolated or even worse, no hous-
ing to new students.

Yet, we have trouble affixing blame in this story. Certainly the pre-
sent condition can’t be blamed on the Student Affairs Office — they in—
herited a bad situation and had to make do as best as they could. 0n the
other hand, we certainly can’t entirely blame the admissions depart-
ment s they were only doing their job and many of the contributing fac-
tors were beyond their control. But the net result is a changed Grinnell
and one that offers less benefits than the old one.

We understand that estimating the number of admissions is not an
easy task, but we also want the Office of Admissions to understand the
consequences of its miscalculations.

A Savage in the prairie
Chess master’s exhibition

this weekend

by Steven M. Way

When the teaching crunch Came in the
mid 19705 and the demand ror biology in-
structors dried up, Allan Savage became
one of only zoo proiessional chess players
and Journalists in the country

Today Savage, ihe husband or Younker
Resident Adviser Donna Rothenberg
Savage, is working on a title that would
place him among the top 500 players in me
world. a status only steps away from the
coveted title of Grand Master.

On Sunday Savage will simultaneously
play as many people as will take him on in a
chess exhibition designed to promote ihe
college chess club Scheduled for 2 pm, at
Barber Plaza, the exhibition IS open to all
regardless oi experience

Savage said he will need only one or two
seconds to decide how he wdl move against
each opponent at the exhibition, thus giving
those who participate a greater chance or
beating the champ.

“A simultaneous demonstration gives
players who ordinarily would not be able to
play the masters a chance to do so,"
Savage said. “Generallv. the number we
take on is 30 to 50 at a time, The more
people who Show up the better."

Savage, who moved here over the sum-
mer from Boston, did not learn chess until
the “relatively late age of ii." As a pre
med student at Clark University he had no
intention oi becoming a professional player
and has relied on the game for his full time
occupation for only three years.

The occupaiion. however, takes up an in-
ordinate amount oi time for in addition [0
writing articles and books, as well as keep
ing up to date on current opening chess
theories, Savage has to spend time prepar»
mg for tournaments and learning the style
or game his future opponents are known to
play.

Savage said that being an American is a
disadvantage ior those aspiring to interna~
tional titles for most international tour-
namenis are held in Europe and are
dominated by the Russians who make up 50
percent oi the top world players.

”In order to get an internalional lille you
have to play in an international tournar
ment, but to play in a tournament you have
to have a ‘Fide Master' (international) tic
[16," he said. “The masters are Very
restrictive in making tournamenl rules "

To conquer the “Catcher that prevents
those without international status in)
playing in the world tournaments. one musl
pay an entrance fee or $300 or more The
best way [or a talented player to break inl-
the international leagues, Savage said, is to
spend an extended period of lime in Europ-
working on three excellent chess perforr
mances 7 enough to justify a title,

"The United Slates Chess Federation will
pay ior part of your expenses ir you have a
title and everything is paid by them it you
are a Grand Master," Savage said Since
there are only 150 Grand Masters in the
world, however, most players rind it rinan»
cially straining to ily around to interna-
tional meets, especially when the prize
money is relatively paltry.

"Professional chess pays much less than
other sports like tennis or gclr so mos
chess players depend on income irom
publishing a d private leaching to make
the" livin he said,

A tournament in Iowa City last week, in
which Savage won first prize, paid only
3120, barely enough to cover expenses.
Tournaments like the U S, Open, which on-
ly occur once annually. pay $3,000 and the
championship tournament for the top is
players in the country carries a $5,500 lirst
prize, Slm|lar to the prize money one could
expect for placing first in a mayor Euro»
pean tournament.

Depending on the cuiccme of Sunday's
exhibition, Savage is conSidering sponsor»
ing a “blindfold tournament” later in the
year, in which he would play two io live
people without looking at the board and all
communication going on in chess notation.

Such a technique requires a special type
of memory, what Savage calls a "chess
memory." “A chess player‘s memory
seems to be rather extensive and it's not
difficult for an experienced player to.
remember moves he made in past games.

“I could Show you the whole game I =
played last week in Iowa City right now but,
the way you remember a game is in the
ideas and not in lhe moves, more in at
Gestalt way than in remembering each of
40 moves." ‘

Savage has recently completed a begin;
ners instructional book on chess that will be
published next year by Prentice-Hall. .
