The past few months haven t been Ctood for veterans
from Arizona. Twice now the haveiost in a big way
on the national stage. And while the November loss
miUht have caused more excitement here In Grinnell
the Sn erbowl had quite 1 few students glued to the
couch ast Sunday

at the SGA sponsored superbowl party in the Forum
South Lounge, over so snidents watched the game while chr
eral more dropped in for the free food and drinks .

“We have a lot ofbig events and this one is very well attends
ed,” said Jeff S' 'ck ‘09, SGA Films Chair. “It's 1 little bigger
than last year but it’s a pretty great turnout, actually. I deﬁnitely
see more people sitting down watching the game.

The event started at 5 p. In. last Sunday with kickoffat ap-
proxrm1tely s: 20 p m. All SGA had to do was provide the
food, which made the preparation easy

“i usually tvarch the Superbowl so it's fun to throw this pilrr
ry," Sinick said, “But I consider this 1 smaller cvcnt [for SGA]
just because it costs us less."

Although there were 1 few students in jerseys that cared
about the oirrconre, most just wanted what the Superbowl is
supposed to proliilswlenllly good football

My main concern is that i get to see 1 good wattle, said

Eutwherher they were rhcte rooting for 1 team or the corn-
mercials, the experience was a good one.

“I get a big screen to watch the game,“ Kieselbach said. “We
have great food, we have pizza, we have chips, we have dip and
for a fan that’s all you can ask for when you watch a game."

But the forum Wasn’t the only place to catch the game. Seva
eral dorms across campus feanired their own parties and one of
the largest was at Cleveland 1st lounge. This is rhc second year
that Emily Iwuc ’08 has held 3 Superbowl party.

“I don't have a television at my place so I just figured I'd do
it again here, Iwuc said, who graduated last year and has been
living' in town for the past semester. ‘And I vnrnted another try

And next year it won’t be hard to find Iwuc; she’ll be in

Science vs. tradition: the age old battle continues

super Bowl XLIII is already being consid~
ered one of the greatest of all time. It had the
longest play in the game’s historyithe Cﬂdl’
nals h1d two phenomenal c1tches in the end
zone. It all culmin1tcd with a suspenscrﬁlled
final drive capped off by a beautiful snag by
Santonio Holmes who somehow managed to
get both feet down at the edge ofthe end zone.
Unfortunately, one aspect of the game that will
continue to haunt its legacy is the downright
horrendous officiating that may have cost the
Arizona Cardinals the game.

Now, {1111 not going to complain on Aria
aonas behalf because there's a larger issue here,
and you re bound to have already heard or read
someone protesting about the calls anywtiyl No,
the problem we saw lasr Sunday was not cnrireiy
the fault ofTeiry McAulcy's officiating crew—
11 was ltlso the fault of the major professional
sports leagues being somewhar unconcelncd
with muting sure ch? games are called correctly
and accurately

None orrho major sports fully utilize the in—
credible 1dv1nces in rechnology to help call bet—
ter games while some commentators don’t even
want to use the technology already in place.

There is no reason why we cant apply break»
throughs in sensor technology to determine if
and when a football crosses 1 goal line. Some
may say that such adjustments might affect the
way the game is played. but that is extremely
doubtful. Even iftltey were to attest game play,
players will just have to lcarn to deal with it.
Pitchers got used to a lower mound, goalies are
gerring used to smaller equipment and quarter
backs can get used to the ball being 1 slight rick
off, in order to make

argument lve heard since Carl Everett claimed
dinosaurs did not CXISL The point of having
umpires is not to uphold some weird norion of
tradition, but to make calls in the most objective

_vmy possible. If that means replacing the home

plate umpire with a computer system that can

accurately cull balls and strikes, then so be it.

30 television timeouts during a game. It isn't
necessary to h1ve a commercial break before

and after a kickoff. 1 propose 1 pretty simple
solution—just show some commercials during
the revrew. I don’t need to see announcers break
down the same replay over and over again, be
cause, guess what? The announcers are terrible
at deciphering what the referees are going to
call. Even when it is absolutely apparent to cv-
eryone in the audience, Bill Maas is still going
to be oblivious as to what's going to happen. In
addition, halfof the camera angles show nothr
ing pertinent to the play. So all I ask for is to
be shown the best angle or two coming out of
commercial, and not to have to wait 10 minutes
between the extra point and the first play otthe
next drive.

Terrible officiating is so ivlde~spre1d that
it's even gotten to the point where video games
h1vc begun to insert blatantly wrong officiating
decisions into the game For ca1mple, as m1ny of
you know, irt the various incar-narions of Mad-

the NFL. Howevcciust because you challenge a
play, even one that is clearly incorrect which you
can tell from Instant replay that doesn’t mean
rhat the inrgilme referces will make rhc right
decision 1nd overturn the call. It's so realistic!

Divers and swimmers shed times, increase scores

BY CARLOS LU

This past weekend, the men's and women's swimming and
diving teams hosted a dual meet at Obermiller Pool against
(Zoe and Luther College‘s. Both men’s and women‘s teams lost
to Luther, but won against Coe. More importantly, though, 50
swimmers shed their times, and one provisionally qualified for
the NCAA Nationals Meet in diving.

Kelly Bruce '12 earned the quali ication by winning the
women’s one-meter dive where she scored 248.45 points.

“I felt a lot of pressure this weekend because I knew it was
one of two ﬁnal chances to get the qualifying score," Bruce said.
“But I've been pretty consistent on the one—meter board this year,
so I was optimistic."

Now she waits while a committee reviews videotapes of her
dives and decides ifshe will attend the National Meet this spring
in Minneapolis. “I'm not sure how likely it is thatl will get to go

to Nationals," Bnice said. “But It is a great accomplishment to
even be considered and I couldn’t h1vc asked for any more."
Hcr tcamm1tcs shared her enthusiasm for the accomplish-
ment. “Seeing her do that already was so great, and she’s really
humble about it too," added fellow teammate and good friend
Morgan Bober’IZ. “She didn’t get to go to Florida [to face Corr
necticut College] with us,so for her to do that is incredible.”
Bruce won the thrcermeter dive as well. Other swimmers
who won two meets for the women’s side were Eobcr and Amy
Hadow’IO. Eobcr won the IOU-yard b1ckstroke,Hadow won the
loo-yard butterﬂy and herb were a part of the winning 400-yard
medley relay team with Alex Peitz‘lo and Valerie Stimac ’09.
Women swimmers who finished runner—up in their respeCr
tive events were Chloe Moryl ‘10 (the SEE} features editor) in
the soayard freestyle, stimac in the 200 IM, and the aooayard
freestyle relay team of Casey Srrickler ‘12, Margaret Smith ‘09,

Meghan McDonicl ‘10 and Morgan Horton ‘11 (the SSE}
opinion editor).

on the men's side, Paul Gagne '11 won the l,000yard freer
style,Tom Lankiewicz’lZ won the 200 IM,-1nd Nick Smith ’10
won the one-meter dive. “It felt good [to wrn], but the goal was
to drop time, and I accomplished that," Gagne said on his pcrr
formanee.

Lanldcwlcz was also a runner-up in the 500 freestyle and as
part of the 400 freestyle relay team with Marco Fulgoni ’12,}on
Willuhn ‘10 and Ross Noeckcr ’11.

With so many swimmers and divers performing well, the
teams are in great condition for the MWC championships,
which are only two weeks away. “This is rhe best that I’ve ever
seen this team swim before conference in rhe three years that I’ve
been here," Gagne said. “We are in great shape to have a good
ﬁnish to the season."
