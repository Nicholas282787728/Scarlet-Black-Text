We'll Keep
You Posted

My long odyssey with the
SGA Handbook is ﬁnally at an
end. Solne of you may rememr
ber that I talked about the Hand-
book in my campaign last year.
I naively hoped to finish the
Handbook over the summer and
have it distributed by the time
classes started in the fall. I
quickly found out that I would be

lucky to have the text compiled
by September. With the help of
Karen Bell from the Research and
Evaluation Office, I finished the
lay-out of the Handbook on a
Mac II by the end of fall break.

After tointBoard approved
the $700 budget, I sent the
Handbook to the printers who
bound it to the cover. The
finished product was back by the
Wednesday before Thanksgiving
break, my family Collated the
"current officers" handout after

Iffice distributed the whole thing
to your boxes on Friday.
ncidcntally. Dave Jones took the
uieture that appears on the
Handbook cover. I accidentally
orgot to credit him in the
publication.

I have no illusions about
he Handbook. I'm guessing it
will take it‘s place on your desk
among the other little-used
booklets Grinnell unloads on all
If us at the beginning of each
semester. But I hope you will
keep it. Chances are at one time
r another during the year you’ll
ccd information from, have a
question about, or want funding
from SGA. The Handbook is
esigned to help you with that
and more. The "Content" page
outlines everything the publiear
'on has to offer. Take a look at
it, I think you‘ll be surprised
bout what SGA actually is and

Greg and I are preparing for
SGA'S fifth and final Open Fo-
rum of this semester. The first
four dealt with rape and harass-
ment, the first set of initiatives,
the library and bookstore, and the
second set of initiatives. On
Monday, Dec. 5, at 7:30 p.m. in
South Lounge. the fifth SGA
Open Forum will be held. Its
subject is ﬁnancial aid at Grinnell
College. James Lincoln, director
of Financial Aid, will be there to
answer questions. In addition,
Mr. Lincoln wants me to
emphasize that he will be giving
out important financial aid in
formation for everyone on ﬁnan—
cial aid at this Open Forum.
Please come, though we had a
great turnout for the ﬁrst Open
Forum, the last three have had
lackluster attendance,

Next semester the five
SGA Open Forums will be on
the third set of initiatives,
minority recruiting, the presiden—
tial/vice-presidential elections.
the fourth set of initiatives, and
women's and gender studies. If
an issue does come up that needs
to be addressed, though, Greg and
lwill either change the subject of
one Open Forum, or add a new
date to deal with the issue.
That‘s exactly what we did with
the Rape and Harassment Open
Forum: it replaced one on Dining
Servi es.

Allin all, I think SGA has
had a pretty successful semester.
I'm going to send a semester-end
report to the student body over
winter break outlining what SGA
has done this past semester. I'll
also include some of the goals we
have for next semester. And
speaking of next semester, after
an application and interview pro-
cess Greg and l appointed John
Master to be the new assistant
student coordinator. We're
confident he’ll do a great job.
Have a good break.

Against the Grain

As promised, this week I
will focus on the topic of the [or
galization of drugs. Before I get
into that, however, I made a
promise to state in the ﬁrst para
graph of my column that "Dining
Services has agreed to stop pur-
chasing Callfomia table grapes."
While I temporarily admit defeat
on this issue, I must also state

the Kent

that I have requested a Student
Judicial Council investigation of
the matter, as well as a student
judicial injunction ordering Din-
ing Services to comply with
boycott regulations.

Now, to the meat and
'laters.

1 do not do drugs. I need to
state that right out in from before
everybody gets the idea that I am
an addict who is worried about
getting caught. The reason that I
support the legalization of drugs
comes from my belief that
everybody should have the right
to do whatever they want so long
as they aren‘t injuring anyone
else. As I see it, the person who
retires to his bedroom, lights up
a joint, smokes it, gets his high
and then sleeps it off is not hurt»
log me nor any other person be
sides himself. Society has no
reason to "protect itself" from
such a person. This person is
not endangering society, and
therefore should not be hindered
in his pursuit of happiness.

Hold on just a minute,
though, My support for the [or
galization of drugs is far from
boundless, I don't believe that
anyone has the right to light up a
joint in a crowded public place. I
don‘t believe that the doctor who
is going to operate on me, or the
pilot who is going to fly the jetl

"Self-Control"

am riding on have the right to do
a line right before they come to
work, (By the way, sorry about
the use of the term "boneheads"
in the last column. It was inap-
propriate and inﬂammatory. I
hope the parties involved will
accept my apology.) I support
mandatory drug testing for per-
sons whose oecupations require
them to be directly responsible
for the lives or safety of other

persons. I also support manda-

~tory termination on first offense.

Of course, I feel the same way
about alcohol (more about that
later).

I also do not believe that
being under the influence of a
drug should excuse any criminal
act. A person is ALWAYS re—
sponsible for their actions.

Let‘s get back to why I
support legalized drugs. "The
pursuit of happiness" is a very
vague term, and purposefully so.
It would be a very dark world that
required all of the members of a
society to use the same definition
of "happiness." I may consider
reading Saul Alinsky or Leo
Tolstoy to be the epiphany of
happiness while others may con-
sider the exact same thing to be
equivocal to being married to the
fiend incarnate. It is not my
place to tell other people what
makes them happy, nor is it
anyone else's place to tell me the
same. If someone derives plea-
sure from being whipped and
beaten, as long as they don't hurt
anybody else, it’s fine by me.
The condition of their body is
their responsibility. It doesn't
affect me if they have to walk
around with a broken rib, so it's
none of my business, they aren't
injuring me or society.

How is it that alcohol is so
different from drugs? Alcohol is

a drug. Why should society allow
one drug while prohibiting oth-
ers? Tradition? We don‘t outlaw
new foods or new surgical proccr
durcs. Why should we outlaw
new "reality-altering" substances.
We have been altering our reali-
ties with alcohol long before
drugs hit the popular scene.

Of course, there is always
the chance of drug overdose.
There is always the Chance of a
person becoming addicted. There
is always the chance of a person
dying during a really bad trip.
Thousands of lives would be lost
every year either indirectly or di-
rectly because of drugs. of
course, thousands of lives are lost
every year In automobile acci-
dents. Should We make cars ille-
gal to protect society from harm’.7
The point I am making is that
there are risks involved in just
about everything. Nobody forces
you to ever ride in a car. If you
never get into a car you will
never die in a car accident Many
people, however, are willing to
risk their lives for the beneﬁt of
traveling from place to place. If
somebody wants to drive a car,
they accept the risks and respon-
sibilities of their actions. In
their mind, the risks are worth
the benefits. Society has no
place telling them that they can
not drive a car because they may
hurt themselves.

They are willing to lake the
risks, they are willing to accept
the responsibility, and they are
entitled to pursue happiness in
the way that they see fit. If
someone wants to do drugs, does
so discreetly, and doesn't hurt
anybody else, that should be their
right.
