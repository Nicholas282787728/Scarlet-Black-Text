Slim-t Ileoicto o/ thc Plot of Twelfth
Night. by Charles
1101mm, .

Oi all Shakespeare's comedies, pen
llaps Tuelitn Night is the most richly
woven with the various strands of
love, both serious and witty. Not
only do we have here a beautiful seri-
ous vein of poetic feeling which really
is the framework or the play. but in-
ternilngling with it is a thread of uh~
forced and ”upl'oftrious fun.” Viola
is the heroine of the drama, illsomuch
us the play originates ‘th her and is
motivated by her disguise. Here the
great artist has composed a character
oi a few simple elements,7tende!‘uess,
gentelness, sensitiveness and a hold
imaginative mind, which iinpels her to
enter situations and embarrassmcnts.
with which the play deals. sir Toby
and Sir Andrew on the other hand, are
trolichsome and whimsical with a plen~
tiiul stock of wit and an equal lack
of money to keep it in motion."
Shakespeare displays here his genius
in character building—one type the
most manly and her 'c, the other ludi-
crous and proud. Here we have on
harmonious picture of grace and sentie
merit mixed with humor and witia.

of] characters as Viola, Malvoiio, Sir
Toby and Olivis, which art is only
within reach of Shakespeare.

Viola and Sebastian, twins, have
been shipwrecked and each believes the
other lost. Viola is cast ashore on the
coast of illgl-ia where she dons male
attire and ﬁnds sc ‘9 as lingo at the
