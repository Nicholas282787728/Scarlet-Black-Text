Wine improves with age and so
does education, according to
faculty wives who have taken
courses at the college. The
maturation process has given
these women a chance to explore
the working world, As a result,
thsc have specific educational
goals, based upon personal ex
perience, that so many liberal arts
undergraduates seem to be
leging,

Practical experjence has
enabled Thomsa Haas (wife of
Dennis Haas, the college chaplain)
ﬁat “something different” from
\ cation. “There's so much I
didn’t get out of school,” she noted
ruefuliy. “I just didn't have the
time.”

Mrs. Haas, who has a Masters
degree in Christian Education, has
profited from her teaching ex
perience at the Day Care Center
and is working towards her
Elementary Education cer-
tifiaation, one of the few
pro essional programs that
Grinnell offers.

Faculty spouses are permitted to
takea full course load, tuition-tree,
ahiiigh the majority take one to
two’courses a semester because of
domestic and professional
responsibilities. Mrs. Haas finds
that taking a light Course load

"es her of the academic
pressure she knew as an un-
dergraduate student when she
“lived from test to test, paper to
paper." However, she has a tough
schedule having to care for four
children and holding down a job,
and refused to ”apologize for not
having sixteen credits."

Education interspersed with
working experience appears to
leg: academic pressure while

ob. ations.

Paula Hudyme (wife of
Professor of Music John Jensen)
5a} a broader age group of
st' nts would be helpful to
yo 'ger students. Older students
can set “good examples,” she said,
”like studying habits."

Ms. Hudyme, who gives voice
lessons at the college in addition to
taking an occasional art course,
observed that many students
neglecttheir health and “just don’t
take care of themselves as they
should.“

Grinnell students are “pretty
cool” in their acceptance of faculty
sp res taking courses, said
Elizabeth Stessel (wife of
Professor of American Studies
Ha Stessel) and they realize
“l' ‘don't get special treatment”
from professors.

”I‘m just.another student."
commented Mrs. Stessel, Like all
students, she sometimes comes to
elm unprepared, but doesn’t ieel
professors try to “catch“ un-
prepared students, They realize

mitted.

There appear to be no reser~
vatinns among faculty wives about
taking courses from professors
with Whom they have social Con»
tact, because they are sure
professors are objective inside the
classroom,

Faculty spouses are familiar
with registration difficulties, but in
comparison with Brown Univer
sity, Grinnell has few
“bureaucratic hassles” owing to
its small size, observed Susan
Strauber (wife of Professor of
Political Science Ira Strauber).

Special students, a category that
faculty spouses fall into, are not
permitted to pre~register for
classes, and cannot sign up for
classes until the day after
registration. They often find the
classes they want Closed, but they
accept the restriction good-
naturedly.

Participation in college courses
has increased the number of
Student contacts for many of these
women and is an added benefit to
their classroom experience. They
believe they have gotten to know
students on a deeper basis and
have been made aware of the
student perspective on college
matters.

Senior plans
’in good shape’

byMarkVoorhees

Although Senior Commencement
is not until May, plans,
preparations, and committees are
currently underway organizing the
seniors' farewell to Grinnell
College. The majority of Work is
carried out by William Deminoff,
director of college relations, and
Dorothy Palmer, alumni executive
secretary. However, the
Senior Week Committee, formed
each year and comprised of
students is instrumental in the
“ﬂexible detail changes from year
to year" of the ceremony, ace
cording to Vice-Chairman, Kathy
Kramer.

Recently, the most important
decision has been to invite Murray
Kempton, CBS radio commentator
and former editor of the New
Republic to speak at com-
mencement and receive the
honorary degree, Doctor of Laws.
According to those resumes
reporters get handed, Kempton
”has been a labor columnist,
publicity director of the American
Labor Party, and is known for his
penetrating writing on politics and

Society.” Kempton has agreed to
speak.

Deminoff's and Palmer‘s duties
include organizing a program of
events, making sure recipients of
the honorary degrees have been
picked and replied, ithe recipients
have accepted the invitations but
their names have yet to be an
nounced officially), and matters
concerning the physical
arrangements of the actual
ceremony.

Students decide upon the Senior
Gift of the school. and all the
Senior parties. They are con-
sidering a program {or the Senior
Assembly and some sort of en
tertainment for the Senior Dinner.
Kramer mentioned that former
President Leggett had given his
personal money for the senior
parties, However, President
Turner does not, so the committee
has minimal funds and is in the
process of applying for SGA funds.

Despite lack of funds for parties,

Deminoff insisted that the process
is in excellent shape.
