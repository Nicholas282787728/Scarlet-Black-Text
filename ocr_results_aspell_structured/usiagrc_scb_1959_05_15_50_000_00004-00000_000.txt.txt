The Executive Cotiltctl and tho

The announcement oi the

Headed by President Howard

Among the duties of the

council are to “have oversight '

oi the curriculum," “provide
ior a continuing study or car
ueational policies and proceeile
urcs" and “supervise the gen-
eral college objectives, gradua—
tion requirements, and other
matters or curriculum, in-
eluding relateil testing pro»

‘In the opinion of this report- at women's office by Mondaii
er, this is a most crucial issue. Mrs. Burma sai ‘
_ln the past, neither the consti I
. tution nor its bylaws and legis- . . _ Vi
lation has adequately defined flgiscgﬁiﬁgf mm ”1° Ge” ‘
the powers and jurisdiction of‘ '
campus governing bodies. It is
uniortunate that this deﬁciency
had to be pointed up by the
rather absurd power struggle
now waging between the coun-
cil and the c of HP. However,
the problem does exist, and I
believe that it is the right and
duty of the council to enact ap.
pi-opriate bylaws and legislar
tion which will adequately do
ﬁne the power oi each campus
group, so that iuturc problems
of this nature can be speedily
and justly dealt with. That thel
,council has the right to deﬁnei
the powers of these bodies, in-
cluding the c or HP and the
AWS Board is granted by the
Itvords “and shall he the supreme .
governing body” These “,0de more eﬁectivc body. It lclt that‘

In the latter case, the elimi-
nation of class presidents from
the Central Committee, a rep-
resentative of the Constitution‘
Committee explained that thev
committee had felt that thesel
oﬁicers were "generally super-
lliious" on a primarily “execus

tive" committee.
