Allan Kellar
Hunter, as the Gobineau‘s,
manage, through their fine
playing to each other, to make
their little hit a very poignant
scene. Nancy. who is a fresh-
man, has an excellent voice,
and is smart enough stage-
wise to know better than to
rely on that alone. Nancy One,
who sings Mrsi Nolan, is very
touching in the seance scene.
She shows a great deal of ma-
turity in a very diiiicult part.
A small note here for Jan
Peterson, who gives us only
a taste of her very nice
voice and who has the pa<
tienoe of a saint; she has to
stay backstage for the whole
show.

From the directing end of
“The Medium,” credit must be
split two ways. Mr. Crossley has
trained the voices so that they
sing Menocti’s difficult score
wih soreness and accuracy.
Chuck Haynes’ direction and
staging deserve more attention
than is usually paid to a stu~

CONGRATULATIONS. SENiORS

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE.

dent's work. He has not only
caught the bizarre quality in the
set, but hzs carried it through
all aspects of the performance.
Chuck has done something to
the actors to make them believe
in what they are doing, and
done it without a too highly
intcllecluallzed concept of char-
acterization. The emotional
truth he has brought out in
“The Medium" makes the show
a rewarding experience in
theatre.

Perhaps a special thank-you
is due here to Shirley Speel—
man, an accomplished musician

in her own right. Shirley has
accompanied every Opera Work-
shop production since she ar-
rived at Grinnell. and has al-
ways giv- the cast the best of
her talent.

Considering the lineup of
theatre productions this year
“Tartuffe,” “The Hunted," “Ab-
raham and Isaac,” “Julius Cae-
sar,” and ‘There Was a Man in
Our Town," the year has been
not only interesting in its ap-
proach to educational theatre,
but also fairly entertaining to
the audiences. Both reach a
peak in “The Medium."
