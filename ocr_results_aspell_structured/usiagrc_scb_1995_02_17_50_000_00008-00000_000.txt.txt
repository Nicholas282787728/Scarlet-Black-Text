Tuesday. Remember, stay thehell away.

that it be replaced with Chicken Patty
Parmesan. Oursource (DeepFned) tells
us that if ﬁﬂy more people make the
request ﬁsh platter is gone. It will only
be safe to retum to the dining halls on
Tuesday of weeks when CPP conquers
the hated fried demons from the sea.

LastMonday, Steve Groganand his
roommate Mosi cooked us a New Ens

chowder. Hated it Jon broke out in
hives, Obviously these guys did notread
our guide that we printed two weeks ago
about how to appease our stomachs.
JON IS ALLERGIC TO FISH.

The second course was some kind
of spiced shrimp with horseradish mass
querading as cocktail sauce. Again, we
can't stress enough die imponance of
reading our guide. JASON HATES
SPICY FOOD.

The main course was a Boston prime

stock. The stock went up twenty points
during the meal, but Jed was still un-

Tales From Another World

A weekly column by Grinnellians oﬁcampus

 

 

By ANGELI MCKNIGHT
Studying in Russia

HE cold which burnsi like
whiterhot metal 7 is so
painful and so pure, I think

this is what attracts me to Russia
more than to any other place in the
world. There is a history ot’sufferr
ing here, and it shows in the faces
of the people 7 the determination
in their eyes and the lines in their
skin.

This is a country of strength
and passion where life is hard and a
spiritual well-
spring carries
people through
their daily lives,

Havingonly
been here three
andahalfwceks.
my impressions
arcvagueandinr
complete. I
came here not really knowing what
toexpectbutthtnkingltfe would be
difﬁcult and of course not always
logical. My experiences have been
all of the above in an overwhelm-
ingly positive light I‘m taking
everythingasalcarningexperience
from waiting in line to watching

Russian television.
1 have found people to be very

friendly. Manynrelnterestedinthe
United States and life in the United
States. I have made friends byjust
meeting or bumping into pcoplc on
t the strectand in cafes, Socializing
t often takes place around a table
, with tea or with the Russian favorr
ite ~ vodka. Socializing around thc
table, Russian people listen to mu—
SIC, smoke cigarettes and haveloiig
conversations filled with lots of
tight

people "

Sensual language, friendliness

I have discovered several ins
dicntions of the “spirit of the
people"inthelanguageltself, One
example is the many and varied
terms ofendeztrment that Russians
use when talking with friends and
relatives. Almost any name and
many other nouns can be endeared
byaddingtlioendingsenka,eecllka,
ooshka, etc. My Russian language
professor often calls me
Oomnccchka from the word
oomneetsa, which means clever
person, Today my host mother
called me lappooshka, from the
word lappa. which
means ”paw," The .
aoshka ending
makes it a nickname
for a loved one.
meaning small, soft,
dear and sweet.

TheRussianlan-
guage IS also very
physical and sensual
when spoken. One must use his or
her whole mouth including lips,
tongue and teeth. And finally, I've
noticed the frequency of the use of
the Word “soul" in many phrases
and expressions front “my dear" to
“a conversation from the soul.“

I have found lhts to be a place

of beautiful surprises, Beneath
cold. stern and hardened exteriors

lie warin, generous and very car-
ing souls.

Two thoughts stand out in my
mind as cxnmplcs orthc gifts Rue
sia has given me thus far.

I‘d say Black History Month is im
portant because sometimes we forget
the great suides made in civil liber-
ties. Hopefully some retrospective
analysis will he made [from the
month]sothatnominoriticswillever
lose their rights.

Kari Bassett ‘98 Undeclared
Ithinktheideabehind BlackHistory
month (education) is great, but it
doesn’t really do much to alleviate
racial tensions.

Zanemvula Madlala ‘97 Poll Sci
1 think it's necessary because here on
campus it kind of gives people a
perspective on whatit feels like to be
in a multicultural experience and
helps further multiculturalism.

Shana Hooker ‘97 Undeclared
Black History Month is deﬁnitely
necessary, because it’s very impor-
tantto rcspectothercultures. On that
note, though. why don‘t wt: have his-
tory months, or something similar,
for any other cultures?
