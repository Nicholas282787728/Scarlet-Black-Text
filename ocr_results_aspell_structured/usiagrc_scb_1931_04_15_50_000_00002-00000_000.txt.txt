A SGHOLAR LOST

Professors, some have said, are getting to he
no more intelligent than their students, and‘ulay
have even less interest in the curriculum.

Arnold V. Johnston was a living refutation of
such statements. He was a teacher of the old school.
who made thorough acquaintance with the subject
his ﬁrst interest and purpose. Pl'ofess Johnston
had, for example, large amounts of information
in clippings and quotations, available in a s. stelllr
atic catalog that was the envy of his colleagues.
His students u re impressed by his ample familiar-
ity with bibliography on molly subjects.

As one seeks for a parallel to this scholar, one
is reminded of Immanuel Kant. the trail. method-
ical philosopher of Konigslml‘g, who ﬁnally amazed
the World with the synthesis of things and thoughts
which thinkers cannot, after 150 years. ignore.

It is such men that enable colleges to remain
truly educational institutions. The loss of such a
teacher cannot but be felt.

AN EDITOR ANSWERS

Grinnell college editors have heeu long suffer-
ing. Year after year they have accepted complaints
from faculty members and students alike hut have
made an effort to avoid retaliation for fear that
personal prejudice would become a major issue.
There have been many in both the student hody
alld faculty who approve of each editor’s polici ,
but these persons are lunch less likely to make their
views know than those who desi c,to complain.

John Canning, retiring editor of The Scarlet
and Black, has answered any complaints which may
have arl. on during his term of office. He entered a
national contest with 900 other college publications,
and has just received word that The Scarlet and
Black Won Alermcricali honor ratillggthc highs
est classiﬁcation possilllc. The competing llcwsr
papers were judged on news. editorials, and make-
up. . .
Almost every editor, if he is an ardent journal-

ist, has his own theories. Some want to rellgtllcu

the editorials, others are primarily stylists, a few

think chiefly of makeup, while at times one tries

to make “hot news” his premier consideration.

Many have strengthened some departments at the

expense of others. Editor Canning’s views wer

broad enough to include every column in the not .

paper and the changes which he made have been

, improvements. His answer stands, “All-American
honor rating.”

THE UNSUNG GREAT

(From the Glendale Press)

A brief peraraph recently in the press says that
President J. H. T. Main of Grinnell college is dead at
the age of 71, This is an Iowa college that, under
the guidance of Dr. Main during- more than a quarter-
of a century. had reached a dignity and inﬂuence placing
it in the ﬁrstclass among such institutions.

To many readers the paragraph will convey little
meaning, but. to thousands of former students scattered
throughout the land, many of them in California, it will
convey a sense of loss, They had received the benison
of Contact with a great. mind and a kindly soul.

The effect of association with Dr. Main had been to
uplift them, to broaden their views, to render them
amenable to the sway of high principles. He had been
an example and an inspiration, his spirit shining be-
fore them as a revealing light. ,

This country is rich in men of similar character.
each in his own ﬁeld, engaged in making the world
not only more intelligent but. better in moral sense.
They.seek to equip students for the battle of life. and
they send them forth charged with honorable ambitions
and with a capacity for successful endeavor.

- The benignity of their devoted service is measure-
less. They do not seek to be acclaimed. They are dedi-
cated to high ideals, true to all that is best, mission-
,aries to youth.

Dr. Main would not have thought of himself as
great. He rejoiced in accomplishment but not for his
own sake. His type is the embodiment of unselfishness,‘
striving not for glory but for social and moral better-
merit through th'c quickening of the intellect. Their
work done, they pass on unsung as great, yet richly
deserving of the tribute of affection and respect.

Happy the land, and rich in promise, where such
men hold out their hands to youth; leading the un-
trained and setting their feet upon the path of the
clearminded and the upright.
