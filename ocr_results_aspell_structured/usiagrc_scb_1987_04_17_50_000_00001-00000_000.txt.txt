Students protest “dormatization” of Juggling House

by Anya Gi' undmunil

The collegesowned house at 916-18 Sixth
Avenue tiuggling Housei "wasn’t the best
planned house In the world," Jim Teder-
man. dean of student affairs, admitted
when he was asked to respond Wednesday
to student questions raised about the
house's renovation, “I tliilik we made
some mistakes over there. and I would
hope that we won't make them in the
future," Tedernlali said

Tim Mueller. a sophomore currently IIVV
mg in a coop house. submitted a proposal
last semester to the Office of Studeilt Al's
lairs containing student requests tor the
house’s renovation. Interested in main-
taining a non-institutionalized atmosphere
in the house, Mueller had written that
"916-18 Sixth Ave. Is the only chop left not
to be destroyed by the college’s ‘renova-
tlon plans.’ This is significant because
|here is still time to stop this process. , . .
[I] ask you to put oil renovation of 916-18
Sixth until more senSItive plans are
made.”

Mueller and senior Kris Schaefer had
been upset with the lack of student input in
the college’s renovation procedure. Accors
ding to Schaefer. requests she and Mueller
had made last semester were not con-
sidered before the house was gutted over
Christmas break

Tedermail who was on leave until
Novembei said that he was not able to get
the floor plans until December Tederman
said ‘Mr. Hawn and 1 put some plans
together, and I'd be the first to admit, too
quickly." Tederman asked Hawii not to
work on the house until further plans could
be made ’I‘ederman said. “Hawn didn't
get my message and went ahead with the
demolition "

When Schacffer and Mueller returned
from semester break, they talked to Bob
Townertarsen. assistant dean of Student
Affairs, and were granted permission to
enter the house and observe the state of
renovation. Schaeler said, “We saw the
plans for the house and Bob Towners

ridiculous, They were hand-drawn, had no
dimensions, were out at proportion. No at»

Tlle Scarlet and Black was unable to
reach Dale Hawn, Physical Plant director,
for comment concerning the renovation,

Schaeler and Mueller then submitted
their own plans for the house iSchaefer
said that their plans were “complete with

Tederman "listened to very little of what
we had said were problems with the
house.” She added. “I obviously cannot
represent the entire student body, but I
think I can accurately represent the cons

and I tried to do. And we went to Tederman

Only a few of their suggestions were in-
corporated in the final blueprints, and
their request to keep some oi the wooden
