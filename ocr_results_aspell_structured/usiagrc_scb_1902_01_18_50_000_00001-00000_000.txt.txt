LIBRARY ENDOWMENT.

Effort Being Made to Secure a Per
mancntly Endawed Book Fund.
Details oi the Plan.

For sortie time there has been a
feeling on the part of those who
have the library in charge that
steps should be taken to secure
for it a permanently endowed
book frrnd. Accordingly. some
months ago members of tile
Faculty made subscriptions to
such afund, the movement was
endorsed by the Alumni Associa
tion, which body appointed a
committee to make a canvass of
its members. This canvass was
generously responded to by a
good number, so that at present
the fund amounts to about $2Il§,
which has been given by some
seventy different individuals.
This falls far short of making
adequate provisionforthclrbrary's
needs. however. and with a view
to securing something of an in»
crease at once, certain good
friends of the college, have gener-
ously offered to give 5500 “on
conditionthatthepermanently en-
dowed library funds for books all,
told. exclusive of the Literary
Society and class lurid for the
library. shall be brought up to the
sum of ﬁve thousand dollars with
in six months."

This offer coming from the
source from which it does, isa
most generous one and should
be met with a like generous
spirit. The amount rvhich re
mains to be raised according to
the terms of the gift is about
52400. If students, Faculty, TruSr
tees. graduates, and other friends
will unite in the work, the amount
ought easily to be raised, but
each one must feel a personal re-
sponsibilityto do something, how-
ever small, to this end.

The securing of~a library en-
dowment fund gives opportunity
for making a ﬁtting memorial to
one who for many years as Secre~
tary, Librarian, and Trustee, de-
voted his life to tlle college and
those who careto do so may have
their contributions go to what is
known as the]. M, Chamberlain
Memorial Fund. What has thus
far been given has been to the
Chamberlain Fund butitis notde-

Pudd'll Head Wilson is from
Mark Twain's book of the same
name. The story has a ﬁne plot
and although one of the longest
plays on the American stage to
day, it keeps its popularity won-
derlully. and is always listened to
with sustained and intenseinteresl
from beginning to end. A more
extended review of the play will
appear in these columns at a later
date. The play has been giv,en re
cently in the larger es of lawn
with Mr. Gill playing the star role
and was received with great en-
thusiasm. Oil Christmas day the
crowd at Des Moines to see Mr.
Gill as Plldd'n Head was a record
breaker, and the same interest for
the play wasshown in other places,
The play requires three hours for
presentation. yet the interest in it
never ﬂags.

The cast for the play this year
has been chosen provisionally and
the members are learning their
parts. Rehearsal of parts will
commence in a few days, so as to
have everything thoroughly done
and prevent all possibilities of at:-
cident or delay at a later date.
Miss Glenna Smith has been em
ployed to take charge of the pre»
sentation of the play and has ale
ready done considerable prelimlnr

plied with all thestagc appliances.
curtains, etc. The Colonial is
rapidly approaching completion
and is already showing signs of a
beautiful interior. The decora—
tions and furnishings are of the
best and all this means a splendid
setting for the ﬁne old drama of
the South before the war.
