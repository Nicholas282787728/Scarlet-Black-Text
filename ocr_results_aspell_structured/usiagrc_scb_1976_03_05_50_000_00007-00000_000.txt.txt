wlks at Grinnell are among the
archives housed in the Grinnell
Room in the basement of Burling
Library.

,.The archives include a complete
set of all college publications since
the founding of the college. These
include college catalogues,
yearbooks, literary magazines,

publications, and newspapers.
Copies of the Scarlet and Black as
well as underground newspapers of
recent years will soon be on

located), letters to Josiah Grinnell

uilding of dorms. Anne Kintner,
college archivist“ said that the

Grinnell Room also tries to acquire
several copies of each book and
article published by faculty and
alumni, and keeps one copy in the
vault.

Kintner stated that the reason

for Grinncll, or any college, to have '

archives is to “improve ad-
ministrative etficiency by
Qroviding a place to deposit
/records that are no longer
Created." These records would still
be available but would not be
“taking up valuable office space."
‘The archives provide information
bout the history of the college, its

' evelopment. purpose, and ac- .

complishments. They have value
for students doing research papers
as well as for anyone interested in
Grinnell College’s past or the
accomplishments of students or
faculty.

The Grinnell Room obtained
most of its older papers and books
by chance. Presidential and ads
ministrative correspondence,
particularly that of the trustees,

,d reports concerning the college
are now generally given to the
archives, as are copics of books,

Scrapbooks that belonged to
Grinnell students (and were found
by their grandchildrcn while
cleaning out the attic) have also
added to the collection. Students
themselves have also given per
sonal papers, The largest collec-
tion of these is the papers and book
manuscripts of James Norman
Hall tclass of 1910), who cor
authored Mutiny on the Bounty.
Some of the more interesting
stories about Grinnell can be found
in the faculty reports. The faculty
of 1371 reportcd that several young
men were suspended for attending
a circus which was held outside of
Grinnell, but it seems that all was
not lost, for the same faculty noted
that many students “professed
Christian conversion” and the
prayer meeting attendance was

high-leading to better scholarship.
The faculty of 1875 saw a great
need for a “young ladies boarding
School” as “the want of it has
undoubtedly had its inﬂuence in
diminishing the attendance of
ladies and so of lady graduates."

Kintner is now taking inventory
of all the material in the Gl'innell
Room. She plans to arrange the
material into four parts, following
the college structure: students,
faculty, administration, and
trustees. There will also be guides
which will list them according to
the office or department of their
origin. Kintner plans to keep old
photographs and documents in a
display case outside the Grinnell
Room to Call attention to the
seemingly little-known fact that
the archives do exist

Law women
face obstacles

by Robin Rccant

Although a great deal at progress
has occurred in the past five years
toward achieving equal status for
men and women in the legal
profession, major obstacles still
exist which prevent so per cent
participation in the law by women
This was pointed out during
”Women in Law" day. sponsored
by the Organization of Women Law
Students and Staff (OWLSS) at the
University of Iowa Law School last
week.

The keynote speaker at the
Conference was Roxanne Conlin,
assistant attorney general for the
state of Iowa. Conlin, who attended
law school when the only women in
her class were the top three
students, described her ascent to
her present position as one of
overcoming many prejudices.

The government, Conlin asserts.
is still the foremost employer for
women with law degrees. Yet men
and women tend to View their jobs
with the government from dif-
ferent perspectives. For male
attorneys, government work
represents a stepping stone to a
high-paying, high status position in
a prestigious firm. Women, on the
other hand, start in the govern»
ment and remain in these
relatively lowepaying, low status
jobs for their entire careers.
Although private firms and cor
porations are beginning to offer
opportunities to women,
discrimination in the non-public
sector still prevails, Conlin said,

lloward Porter, dean of ad»
missions at the law school, spoke
on the logistics of applying to law
school and offered statistical in-
formation about the status of
women in law school. Although
women‘s application and ac
ceptancc rate has risen in recent
years, women comprise only 20 per
cent of the law student population
in the United States, and that
tigure is not increasing.

The law students believe that as
discrimination in admissions
procedures eases, psychological
self-discrimination persists in the
minds of many women as to their
capability to pursue a legal
education. Women demand twice

as much from their performance
as do men, and are thus more
reluctant to pursue male-
dominated, high-status ﬁelds. Jane
Eikleberry, former Grinnell
student and third year law student
at University of Iowa, pointed out
that this notion prevents some
capablc women from even cons
sidering the profession She ems
phasized that ”you don't have to be
a superwoman to be an attorney,”

The practical aspects oi law
school were discussed by the
students in a panel entitled “How
to Survive Law School,” A second
year student alluded to the feeling
of inferiority especially prominent
among women upon first entering
school She also mentioned a
dominant fear that law school
meant cutting off ties to one‘s
former life.

Besides the Women's helpful
suggestions and words of en»
couragement. the students
stressed support from other
women as the essential ingredient
for overcoming academic and
psychological barriers while in
school, OWLSS, both formally and
informally, strongly encourages
and assists women to stay in
school.

Toward the end of the Con-
ference, women attorneys spoke on
the topic of life after law school.
They emphasized that a legal edu
cation does not prepare you for
the practical aspects of practicing
law. Upon graduation from law
school, feelings of not knowing how
to he a lawyer run rampant. The
women described different
methods of setting up legal
practices, and also emphasized the

number ot job options open to

women with law degrees other
than traditional firm or private
practice,

Eikleberry encourages Grinnell
women to think about going to law
school, even if they have never
considered themselves as lawyers.

Students and Statf at the College of
Law at the University of lowa in

for assistance and encouragement
in applying to law school.
