Change in internship policy proposed

By Jim iiansen

Internship opportunities at
Grinnell may soon be expanded if a
proposal on the subject is approved
by the iaculty and the Curriculum
Committee.

Calling for full-time, accredited
internships in various fields during
a semester or summer, the
proposed program would require a
$150,000 grant to support it through
its iirst three years.

AS it exists now, Grinnell's in-
ternship program consists oi part
time semester internships with
four hours of credit in the Iowa
State Legislature and the
Executive Department oi the iowa
State government

LAST MAY. Dean Waldo S
Walker appointed an Ad lloc
Committee to review the inn
teriisliip activities at Griniiell and
make recommendations for all ails
School. full-tlme internship
program

After reviewing such programs
at other ACM schools, the Ad Hoc
Committee concluded that they
tacked “academic Content and
Control " Working with the
premise oi academic structure in
mind, the Committee came up with
a proposal ior Crinnell with the
iollowing optional ieatures;

l) The present partetime in
ternships throughout the semester,
with academic credit?

2) Full-time internships ior one
semester or a summer, With
academic credit:

3) Continuation oi the eitisting
career preview internship
program during vacation periods,
with no academic credit;

4) Encouragement oi voluntary
experimental learning related to a
student's major throughout the
academic year or during the
summer, with no academic credit.

ACCORDING to this report,
which was submitted to the
Curriculum Committee, individual
faculty members would act as
supervisors for particular intern

 

projects. They would serve as
advisors to the interns, work with
the off-campus supervisor in
deciding academic goals,
periodically visit the work site
during the process oi the inn
ternship, and evaluate, alter
consultation with the off-campus
superVisor, the student's ex-
perience and academic product at
the end of the internship.
Evaluation was suggested to he a
credit»fail system rather than b'
designated grades. The propose
initial duration oi the program i
three years,

According to Professor C E
Gilmour, chairman of the Ad l-loi
Committee. this academic
supervision is the element that is
missing from the internship
programs or other schools and has
been the reason for Gl‘liinell’s
opposition to internships in the
past. Gilmour ieeis that. this type oi
“academic" lntcrnship could be
both appropriate and compatable
With a liberal arts education

ACCORDING to Gilliionr. the
basic guidelines to such a proposal

would limit participation to juniors _

and seniors with a declarcd major
and sufficient academic
background in the area of the inn
ternship. Gillnour said that my
ternships would not have to be
limited olily to areas covered by
the Grinnell Curriculum. Ina
ternships related to a studen“s
individual career objectives would
also be acceptable.

The proposal will require the
approval oi the iaculty and the
Curriculum Committee after
speciiic guidelines have been
drawn-up by the Oif»Campus study
Committee. The Curriculum
Committee has already endorsed
the proposal in principle.

DEAN Walker, a member of the
OtfeCampus Study Committee,
said these specific guidelines
would most likely be submitted to
the Curriculum Committee soon.

 

There are currently iive students
involved in Grinnell’s internship
program One student, Patty Rose,
is working for the Iowa Com»
mission on the Status of Women.

ROSE is presently showing a
multi-media presentation on
women around the state. She also
is doing research concerning the

feels that her internship will give
her a possible edge over others in
the job market.

“WITH ONLY it B.:\.,” she
commented, “an internship cer-

increased my awareness of

She also feels her internship has
“enhanced" her “academic

perience and actual iield work
complement each other," she said.

proposal for the expansion of
Grinnell’s internship program,
Rose was moderately enthusiastic.
She feels that expansion is a good
idea, but that the rather strict

Crucible premiers tonight

(in October 14, 15 and 16 at 3:00 pm, the Grinnell College Theatre Department will present The
Crucible in Roberts Theatre. The production is directed by Sandy Moiiett and major roles will be played
by students Fritz Ertl, Wendy Morton and Julie Meyer. Tickets are available at the Forum desk.

The Crucible, written by Arthur Miller, tells the story oi people caught up in the disappearance of
reason and the resulting hysteria that accompanied the Salem witch trials in the last decade of the
seventeenth century. Miller. a Pulitzer-prize winner for Death or a Salesman, creates an analogy bet«
ween the Salem trials and the McCarthy hearings on Communism that were at their peak when the play
was written But. in addition to being a political comment, The Crucible is also a dramatic work about
peoplesubmergedin their own greeds. tears, desires and sins. (Photo by Chris Lowerl

,Eewish urban history

to be conference topic

The Jewish ethnic group in 20th
century America will be the focus
of a conference to be held in
Grinnell and Des Moines Sunday
through Tuesday

Alan Jones, history professor,
said the conference “will focus on
the early struggles of Jewish
immigrants, the evolution of
Jewish art and culture in America,
relationships with other ethnic
groups, and the effects at and
responses to social and political
forces.”

“PART OF the point of the cone
ference will be to present perv
spectives on evaluating urban
culture in the latter half of the 20th
century," said Bob Mannheimer,
‘76, who is coordinating the con»
lerence with Jones.

Irving Howe, author, historian
and art critic, art historian Milton
Brown and sociologist Marshall
Sklare will be the principle
speakers at the conference.

HOWE is an English professor, a
major translator of Yiddish
literature. a leading critical
commentator on American
culture, an editor of Dissent
magazine and a historian.

Howe’s 1976 publication, World
ol our Fathers, is called “a
sociocultural study oi the ex-
perience oi the East European
Jews who migrated to America in
the 1330-1924 era," by the 1976 Book
Review Digest.

THE BOOK has been widely
praised. The Digest reported that
R.L. Schoenwald said in the August
27, 1W6 issue of Commonweal, “In
almost overwhelming detail Howe
adds new material on life on (New
York City’s) Lower East Side and
offer fresh insights, The ghastly
living and working conditions
encountered in a ruthless society
which submerged unnumbered lost
souls poorly equipped ior the new
world, the serious dislocation of
family life, the bitter class of the
iirst and second generations, the
rise iron-i poverty to the middle
class and the strategies of protests
devised by those who found this no
promised landithese are but some
oi the themes developed
brilliantly."

Brown, a specialist in American
painting, has recently returned
from Great Britain Where he
organized two major shows of 20th
century American art.

AKAEE has w itteii extensively
on Jewish life in, suburban

America. The Jew in American.

Society, edited by Sklare was
published in 1976, The 1975 Digest
calls the book an “anthology of
analytical Studies about American
Jews.”

According to the 1975 Digest, a
review of the book in the July 1975
issue oi Commentary said, “The
picture oi American Jewish life
which emerges irom (this) reader
is one in which problems and
weaknesses clearly predominattk
not too surprisingly, since Sklare
and most of the contributors . . .
are survivalists, and survivalists
almost always stress threats to
Jewish existence . . To anyone
familiar with the Situation of
American Jewry, the problems
delineated—a rising intermarriage
rate, a generally ineiiective
educational system (and) a
seriously disaffected youth
population, etc—will not come as
revelation. By bringing together
the best available analyses of just
these problems, Sklare enables us
to see that they do indeed add up to
a very real ‘Jewish identity cris-
is} ,,

Another review in Book Review
Digest, irom Contemporary
Sociology: a journal at reviews,
called Sklare’s work “liberal and
cautious.” The reviewer said he
“would have included a good deal
more from the Critical ‘coun-
tercultural’ segment of the Jewish
community as well as from those
'alienated Jewish ‘outsiders’ who
still have much to say from their
lvaniage point."

There will be an exhibition of
Jewish art in the lower level
gallery of the Forum next week as
well as a production of Arthur
Miller‘s “The Crucible," to be
presented in Roberts Theatre at
3:00 pm, today through Sunday.

The conference is sponsored by
the Iowa Board for Public
Programs in the Humanities,

 

Grinnell College, and the Jewish
Welfare Federation of Des Moines.
