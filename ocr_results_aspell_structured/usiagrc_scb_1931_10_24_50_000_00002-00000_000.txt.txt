AFTER THE BATTLE

The Cyclone ballot passed by a bare majority
Vote of tile elltire student body and more than 70
pcr cent of ballots cast. Definite figures published
today sllow the sweeping majority resulted from
all allnost 100 per cent vote in the women’s quad»
Tangle, 50 per cent of voters outside the cottages
being against the plan to make the yearbook colu-
plllsol'y.

\‘lllerc the votes are cast makes little (liffel'v
enee_ however. Men who are talking of starting a
petition against the plan will probably do best to
take tlle vote as it has been cast and pill their
hopes in the faculty and board of trustees who
must pass the plan before the Cyclone is added to
the semester fee. The fact that Stlldcl‘lt‘feel'lllg is
sharply divided has been demonstrated and tl l‘e
have already been too many personal allilllosi es
resulting from something that should be purely a
question of the issue involved and not of person-
alities. It is to be regretted that the move opens
the ground for future additions to the semester fee.

Faculty lnclnbors and trustees will not be
stalnpedcd by statements alld arguments on thc
part of either faction. They have watchcd student
discussions rise to peaks many tilllcs ollly to die
down as the e scs p 9 They know how to handle
youth. That is then business.

Arguments have been presented on both sides
of the case. The vote is evident. Faculty members
and trustees lnay take tllese for the actual merit
involved ill each case—or they may decide simply
on a course that will be best for the student body
as a whole. Student opinion has flared brilliantly

and it is lime to lt‘l older and or men and
women consider. Most. lli‘ the 10 ' in the struggle
[or student lotus will agree with the victors—Mint
it was it great battle while it lasted,

AN APPRECIATION
‘Opening the stacks is an act upon which the
board should be ’congratulaled. On its
part, it shows a spirit of cooperation and real dev
sil'c for solwiuc to the student Although abuse
llcge l‘orccd the doing of the star

_ ago, tlle stlldcnts have been granted an-
other 1 al of the open system to see if they can
makll it work this time.

.13 ' this action, the question 01' open 01‘ elost‘d

s is left entirely to the users of books. If, in
the next two weeks, the students prove that they
have some consideration for pl'opt‘ y, and that they
will have some consideration 01 property, and
that. tllcy will co-operatc. with the librarians ill
maintaining order among the books on tlle shelves,
open stacks will be restored as o. permanent illstir
tlltioll. If not, responsibility for closing tlle stacks
will rest wllolly upon the students.

Browsing among the books, tasting and select
ing new authors, is one of the greatest pleasures of:
using a library, as well .as one of the mostinstruc-
live methods of doing so. Through the fall'rlnllltl-
edness of the board, students are to be given a
chance to show whether tllcy are worthy of that

'liloge. It is to be hoped that they will express
appreciation of this movement of the board
by all adult attitude toward the stacks alld sensible
use of the books.

REVERSAL OF ACTION

Thredore Roosevrlt wrote ill lEJJE), a few days
before his death, “Let civilized Europe and Asia
introduce some kind of police system ill the weak
and disorderly countries at the tlll‘esltllolds. But
let the United States treat Mexico as our Balkan
peninsula.”

It is not hard to remember how 'far removed
from the concerns of the League Americans felt
at that tim Much of the feeling romain' America
was wary of what loo ,d like all elltauglillg alli-
alloc. Democratic politicians found the League a
weak plank ill their platform. By 1928, presidcn»
tial candidates eonsidcrcd alcohol less explosive
than projects of peace

Yet while the country [orgot the Dengue, it
was drifting toward it. The United States signed
a Kellogg pact. the nation found itself doing what
the League members had (lone at Local-no. ‘Nllen
ill the role of an independent nation the United
States protested against a Manchurian fracas
which seemed to threaten war, the country found
it. if acting ill direct concert with the League.
Late reports discover America scaled at the League
council table discussing: what measures the League
shall take in a dispute between League members.

\ththcr or not these events will hasten Amen
ican entrance into the council of nations as a full
member may be debated. But certainly the pr
tense ofisolation from Asiatic and European :1
fairs is a thing of thc past. We have admitted

 

that the countries of Europe and Asia are at our
tllreshholds.

 

What Do You Think

Editor
The Scarlet and Black

Grinnoll, Iowa

Dear Sir:

Is Crinnell college an individual or
socialislic center?

Her students like to believe that
it is socialistic. “Come to Grinnell,"
they cry. “We will help you to work
your way through.” Her students pre-
tend to be kind and willing to help
their fellow classmates, That is the
golden rule, the Christian spirit, they
say. Help others before yourselves
We hear it in the olubrooms, it is
preached in the classrooms. and
thenﬁ

Thursday night came a testis
chance to put all this preaching into
practice. What was the result? Grin»

 

nell students were presented with a
plan‘s plan wherehy they could
save $2. They were told of a plan
Wednesday through the columns of
this paper, Thursday they were ask-
ed to make a final vote. Rusnirg
things a hit, don't you think?

In this>24 hour period, there was
time for but one thought. It came
like a flash to the majority. "A way
for ME to save $2. Surely, I’ll vote
for it. What is it?"

A socialistic center? What do you
think? The FIRST reaction was one
upon the student himself. The social-
istic nature, if one truly exists or.
this campus. is a. distant second,
“Come to Grinnell, we will help you
work your way through,” and then
when these students get here, they
force them to pay as for a book
which many do not care for. To
many as is a lot of money.

This showdown has proven that
the Grinnell student thinks first of
himself. In a week's time, when the
“Cyclone" has blown over, and brains
have functioned, Grinnell students
will see that rather than help their
fellow classmates, they have hinder
ed many.

Socialistie, What do you think?

Sincerely,
Virgil Bowlby.
