The Fine Arts building has been
the main target of a recent series
of thefts and vandalism incidents
on campus, says Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Tederman.

The incidents include:

array of instruments at a concert last week.

Theft, vandalism plague campus

-the theft of 540 from the dance
studio;

-an attempted break»in at the
sound booth in Roberts Theatre;
and

-the disappearance of two hack-
packs.

In addition, Main Hall was
recently broken into, a stereo
cartridge and 570 was stolen from
Cowles, $10 was taken from a purse
in the Forum, and $50 Was pilfered
from the Forum Desk.

The amplifier was stolen from
the dance studio in the Fine Arts
building Feb. 13. Although all of the
cabinets were broken into, only the
ampliiier was taken. “Judging
from this, I assume that the thieves
were very amateur and in quite a
hurry to clear out,” said dance
instructor Babe Voertman,

Voertman added the building is
robbed more often because of its
Iocation. “Because were situated
mainly on the far end of the
campus. lthieves) can easily walk
out Onto the main street in a matter
of seconds." she said.

Donna Dewsnap lost $40 in [he
dance studio dressing room and
said she was surprised by the in
cideht,

“I was (labbergasted it seemed

to me that if you can trust people
anywhere it‘d be at Grinnell,"
' Theatre Arts instructor Jill]
Czechowski said some flat
wrenches were stolen from the
scene shop, apparently to open thc
door of the sound booth during the
attempted break-ill Feb, 14. He
said “the rash of thefts occurring
in the theatre is not
premeditated.”

 

The other thefts, which also
occurred in the Fine Arts Building,
involved students Rosa Mlchnya
and Beth Wiley, who found their
backpacks had been stolen.

Dean of Student Affairs Jim

Tederman says people who use the
Fine Arts building should be aware
of the problem.
, “That building has been the
main target. I think the people in
there ought to be aware of this real
trend of thefts that has been taking
place,” said Tederman

Tederman added, “Another
problem here is that most oi the
thefts that occur are unreported
because the students figure there is
no way they can get their things
back. The students should tell us,
regardless, because it can help us
determine whether or not the thefts
have a certain pattern.”

Vandals who broke into Main
Hall two weeks ago didn't take
anything but did splatter some
black glue on a few renovated
walls,

The $10 ther't In the Forum,
coming on the heels of the robbery
of the desk’s cash box last week,
occurred when desk attendant
Terri Tiddle left her purse on the
desk and later found it missing.

Despite the recent thefts and
vandalism. Patrollncn Jay
Peterson of the Grinnell Police
Department said the school's
crime rate since September has
been below average,

Peterson said he feels the college
needs its own security systcm, but
it is uncertain whether any
security measures will be taken at
this time,
