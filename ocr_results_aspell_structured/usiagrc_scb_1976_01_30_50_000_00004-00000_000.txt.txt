Open closed forum

Open Forum. Brick wall.

Those two go well together when you attend an open
forum on a new housing policy which has already been
formulated. Students can come, voice‘ their opinions, become
frustrated and leave, because the decision was final before
the forum. The democratic, liberal idea of an open forum dies
along with chivalry and New England town meetings.

This was the result of Tuesday's Open Forum on next
year’s off-campus living options. presented by the Student
Affairs Office. Unfortunately, Student Affairs rightfully
admitted the next day that their original statement exV
plaining their decision to limit the number of students living
off campus to 150 next year, was poorly worded and sounded
like an ultimatum.

Tederman said- Wednesday. that if convincing reasons
against the policy had arisen at the forum, Student Affairs
would have returned the policy to Turner and Walker for
reconsideration.

Forgiving Student Affairs their poorly worded statement,
they still are to be blamed for delaying general campus
discussion of the policy change. Initially, when the need was
discovered to change the policy, the open forum should have
been convened. Even if, as Tederman claimed, the Tuesday
forum wasn’t after~the-fact technically, practically, it was.

Along with the poor after-the-fact timing, the turnout and
interchange of the forum were sadly lacking.

Both sides were defensive and Student Affairs failed to
state their position clearly. Students often reacted
emotionally.

Despite the obstacles to communication, both sides
achieved some success. Although Student Affairs' policy
was disliked, they discovered three areas of severe problems
in dorm life: the food service, noise, and the quality of living.
Shocked to find residential life so horribly described, Susan
Crim promised Wednesday that Student Affairs would look
seriously at these areas. Although students didn't change
the policy, they made their points about residence halls.

We should have more open forums, but not like this one
where the only part which seemed open was attendance. The
issues and peoples' minds should be open toe.

Scratch B—7 bombers

By Robert Render

The Congress soon will be
debating whether or not to ap'
propriate over $20 billion toward
the Construction of 244 8-1
supersonic bombers. Sources in the
Chicago Daily News report that an
estimated 92 billion dollars may be
spent in the program’s projected 30
year duration. The present budge|
allocation ior the 13-1 is ap-
proximately $812.5 million, which
covers research and development
through September of 1976, The
Defense Department is seeking an
additional $1 5 billion for fiscal
1977, and will probably get close to
[hat amount. The fight that will be
taking place sometime this spring
is shaping up to resemble the one
over the ill fated SST.

The question as it appears in my
mind centers not only on the
military value of such an aircraft,
but on its representation oi our
national priorities. I think it is high
time that government, both the
executive and the legislative
branches, become more respon-

sive to people's needs—not to the
needs of defense contractors,
Defense Department Officials and
insecure War hawks who will never
be satisfied until we have the
capability to destroy the world
5,000 times over in 10 different
ways,

The projected cost of one B71 is
$84 million, and these figures
always seem to rise midway in the
actual undertaking oi such a
project. That amount of money
could pay for the EPA's proposed
project to cleanse the Great Lakes,
create thousands oi jobs, build
housmg, hospitals. and schools. I!
we allow a project like this to get
under way. God only knows what
else the Pentagon will come up
With to spend the taxpayers’
dollars.

The tangible costs oi this
program are high enough, but we
can only speculate on the en-
vironmental impact of the B-l. The
EnVironmental Protection Agency
has just recommended that the
Anglo-French SST. the ConcordE,

be banned irom us. airports How
could the EPA Justify the Cons
struction of our own supersonic
bomber?

It is time we said no; no to a
proieet that will cost billions ot
dollars, threaten the environment,
and not add significantly to D V
already overstocked arsenal of
nuclear warheads, submarines,
and missiles, which now is a suf-
ficient deterrent to our ad.‘

Matt Cohen

Returning irom a semester of
otfrcampus study in Washington,
D C. I am greeted by “How was
'it’.’ What did you do? Where did you
go? Were you gone last semester?”
and even, “Who the hell are you?“
To all lwould prefer to reply, “Off
you fiends, oii . , . Leave me in
peace . . to contemplate the liner
for less fine) things of life (or of the
past semesterli” For in tact.
despite several personal absciutes
brieﬂy discussed below, the impact
and importance of the past
semester is as yet unclear to me,
and will probably remain so for
several years However, a more
clearly defined purpose and
greater awareness of what to
expect might have either changed
my decision to go to Washington
or made the experience a more
consistently salisfying one. In this
article i seek to share some of the
insights which I retrospectively
realize could have altered my
decision to go off-campus, and

perienee on the Washington
Semester Program, and which, I
would dare to argue, to a sub-
stantial degree characterized the
experience of others in
Washington. and possibly on most
oii-campus study programs.

\bsolute No. i: The Academic
Experience is the weakest aspect
oi the Off»Campus program.
American University, which
sponsors the Washington Semester
Program, cannot be considered an
educational institution in the
traditional sense One gets used to
iancy cars and hot dates, bomb
threats and 3 am. fire alarms, but
not to the pursuit of academic
endeavors.

Absolute No. 2: The experience
oi being in a school situation other
than Grinnell, where one is ex
posed to different types of people,
diiierent types of environments.
and different types of Saudi and
cultural attractions can be, and
was, of great value. Moreover,
where. as was the case in
Washington, the student has the
opportunity to Work as an intern in
an office related to the field of
study, the ability to translate
theoretical gobbledigook into real
understanding is immensely en-
chanced. This is particularly
important in terms of providing a
sense oidimension and perspective
to the given issue,

Absolute No, 3: With regard to
both academics and outside 'ex»

periences, the relevant axiom is: It
is hat you make of it, li you are
wi ’ng to be aggressive in doing
independent work academically, in
seeking out responsibility in the
internship, and in making contact
with new sources oi information,
jobs, etc., the semester can be an
extremely positive one. But it
won’t get done for you.

in light oi these three absolutes.
there are a variety of things which
a person wanting to go off—campus
should consider,

Perhaps most important is to
reach some sort of decision as to
what your objectives are tor the
semester. ii the program which
you are considering is able to
substantially fulfill the objectives
you set, then the decismn is clear
cut.

Development of objectives
should include consideration of
what emphasis you wish to give to
academics. how able you are to be
selistarting and to sustain ins
dependent study. how aggressive
you are in seeking new op»
portunities and meeting new
people, and how this experience
would compare to that which you
would likely get at Grinnell If you
chose to remain hereithat is, to
what extent does the off-campus
program supplement rather than
duplicate the academic program
which you would take here at
Grinnell’?

Beyond this, the prospective off
campus study student should get as
much ieed back as possible from
former students as to What the
people are like on the program,

and in the greater environment
The quality of dorm lite, cooking
arrangements, ease of travel,
safety, and other such mundane
issues should be examined. Those
who are particularly interested in
the internship experience should
inquire as to what types oi in-
ternships are available, where are
good places to look, and what
techniques can be utilized to
maximize the work experience.

Having iound out what there is to
be found out about the program, a
Comparison of the objectives with
the apparent ability of the given
program to achieve those ob-
jectives should be made, Having
done all that, look into the ans
liaipated total cost of the program,
compare it to the cost of Grinnell,
and then run the calculus through
all over again with the cost iactor
included.

My experience was one of ex-
citement, frustration, dismay,
challenge, enjoyment, and shock
For any number of reasons. I had
what was in retrospect a very
inaccurate and incomplete un-
derstanding oi what I could expect
from the program which 1 par
ticipated in. The more accurate
your conception of the program
which you are contemplating. the
more likely that you will be able to
make a more useful assessment of
its personal relevance and use to
you, and the more likely. it you opt
to go, that you will go with a more
realistic expectation of the
character olthe program, and thus
be spared the dismay oi mistaken
hopes.
