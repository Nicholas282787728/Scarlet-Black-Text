Bergerac, Mrs. Malaprop, 0s 'pus,
and other great dramatic characters
of the ages, v. L. Granville, English
actor, will present his recital, "Dra-
matic Interludcs,” next Friday eve~
hing as the next number on the loc-
ture course.

“In swrft succession the great
characters of the drama come and
go, the changes of costume and of
make-up so rapid that they seem in-
credible," one critic has written.

“Laughingly we listen to the hilare
ious plaint of Ergasilus, the Roman
parasite . , . , breathlessly to the
tragic and of Faustus," the critic
continues. “The buoyant narrative of
the fat knight, Falstaff, brings
shouts of merrimcnt and then hunch-
baeked Richard of Gloucester looms
up and fills us with pity and with
terror,

“And then Cyrano de Bergeracihc
of the great nose and the greater
heart, and so to the finale of the ever
ning: wcird, neurotic, creepy Sven-
gali with his ivory-yellow skin and
his nervous, jointlcss hands waving
like ghostly antennae in the mysteri-
ous light . . . . in all an evening of
great, cultured, thoughtful acting
that thrills the audience and gains
its hearty approbatio '

As one of the famous actors
the English stage, Mr. Granville has
played important roles in “Mcrry
Wives of Windsor,‘ “Twelfth Night,”
“Monsieur Beaucztire,” “The Sign of
the Cross,” “If I Were King" and
“Hamlet." In addition, he has pron

Washington university will invade
the Grinnell campus Monday night,
eager to avenge the 33-29 defeat ad~
ministered to them by the Grinncll
cagcrs in the opening game of the
conference season The game will be
the third in four days for the Bears,
sincc they met Missouri last night
and oppose Drake tonight at Des
Moines.

At the present the St, Louis outfit
is tied with Creighton for second
place in the conference standings. The
outcome of the game tonight at
Drake will either give the Washing-
ton quintet cxclusive claim to the
runnerdlp posi ’on or cause the Bull—
dogs to replace it in the tie with the
Blucjays.
Play Three Games

Wednesday night the Bears experi-
enced considerable trouble in down-
ing the Cowboy five from Oklahoma
A. and M., but finally emerged with
a 31-30 victory. Grinnell should pro-
fit frcm the fact that the game with
the Bears follows so closely on this
contest and the succeeding tilts with
Missouri and Drake, since that is a
very strenuous week’s campaign.

Coach White is expected to start
Capt. Floyd Kern and Roy Martintoni
at the forward positions Monday
night. Bob Maysack, veteran center,
wil start at the pivot position, while
the guard posts will be filled by Glenn
Mollcr and Chick Droke, a sophomore
star. ,

May Start Frye

Yesterday Coach Trucsdale an-
nounced that he would start the
same five that opened the game
against Drake, with the possibility
of a change at one forward post.
This lineup includes Santi and Manns
at the guard positions, Bauer at cen»
ter, and Mason at left forward.
Either aliphant or Frye will be the
fifth man.

The Bear»l>roncer tilt promises to
be an exciting one since each team
has shown flashes of excellent bas-
ketball. Both have been responsible
for a decided upset since the game
in St. Louis was played, Washington
nosed out Creighton in the first
meeting of those two quintcts, in a
game very similar to the second
Grinnell—Butler affair. The game
Monday is of considerable impor-
tance in the conference race, since
the loser will he definitely relegated
to the lower division, while the win-
ner will have a chance to earn second
place.
