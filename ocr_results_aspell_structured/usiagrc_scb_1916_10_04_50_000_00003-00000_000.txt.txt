Cllel theater to legitimate musical
comedy in the shape at Flolow‘s
charming old opera, "Martha," pre-
sented by the Boston English Grand
Opera. company, of which Joseph Shee-
han is the particmar bright and sllillr
iug light. The audience was won at
the ﬁrst by the excellent rendition of
tiTe' overture and entre act music
which has so long been absent in Des
Moincs as to seem almost an innova-
tion when revived.

The tnnetul melodies of the opera
are not limited to the soloists of the
company. Rollicking choruses of a
rustic tang, the sentimental ballads of
another generation, and the spirited
and beautiful solos and ensemble lluui-
bel's are as Vital and apnesling in the
i'evndl of ”Martha" as when it was
first produced and contrast strongly
and favorably with the syncopated 01)»

Rose of Summer” are not often rival—
ed on the modern operatic stage.
