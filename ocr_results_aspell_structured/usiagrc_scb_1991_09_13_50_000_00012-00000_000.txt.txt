LastSunday, hidden away on their
new ﬁeld north of the College Physi-
cal Plant, the Grinnell Grifﬁns Rugby
Club lost their season opener to the
Newton Rugby Club in front of a
small crowd The fans were thosedie-
hards with topographical maps who
could ﬁnd the ﬁeld

The Grifﬁns ﬁelded Len enthusias-
tic and gifted, if inexperienced, rook-
ies in their ﬁrst game ever. Even
though the Grifﬁns have an increased
membership from the town this year,
they could not hold their own on the
grass.
“We had a lot of talent in the new
guys, butnoactual game experience,"
said Grifﬁn Sean Murray of the 260

The big Newton team, with help
from several experienced ringers from
the Central College team, scored six
try‘s at four points each, and made
two kicks at one point each, while
they dominated the game. However,
despite all the extra help from Cenr
u-al, only one of those try’s came in
the second half.

The strong second half was due in
largeparttothefiereeplay of Grinnell
senior. Peter Brodyi His leadership
on the field kept up the ferocious
Grifﬁn spirit

Pioneer sophomore Paul Verrette
noted that the young home town team
“was really outsized, but played well.
Our guys took some hard hits, and
gave them right back!"

Indeed, the Grifﬁns did take some
heavy blows, and were forced to

place three members of the squad on
injured reserve Sam Lobe] left the
ﬁeldwith multipleinjuries to his right
arm, including a fractured clavicle.
James Foster, a sophomore, had a
couple of fingers broken on one play.

ﬁns will perform better this weekend
against Newton, on their opponent’s

turf. On Saturday at 1:30, Grinnell's -

Griffins take the ﬁeld once more
against the same Newton team, but
decidedly different players,

room to improve. So we fully expect
to do quite well in the future. And we
had fun too.”

If this is any indication of the sea»

the upcoming Les Duke Invitational
at Oakland Acres on September 21.
Oakland Acres is also the course for
this year‘s Division 111 Regional
Cross Country meet. Approximately
20 teams from all over the country are
expected to compete in the Les Duke
Invitational, a high-powered meet
which Coach Freeman describes as
“one of the top three Division III
meets”.

The Purple Roos are currently
ranked 13th among Division III
schools.

With stiff competition only two
weeks away, the R005 will use that

This past weekend was the
Grinnell women's soccer tcuma-
ment, which consisted of Gustavus
Adolphus, Luther, Westminster and
Grinnell colleges.

Saturday’s matches pitted
Gustav us Adolphus against Grinnell
and Luther versus Westminsterr
Luther defeated Westminster in the
ﬁrst game. The Grinnell team played
agoodgamebutfelltoGustavusZ-O.

Gustavus capitalized on two rev
starts, striking on a thirty yard indir
reetkick and then scoring on acomer
kick. Coach Eskildsen described the
game’s flow as “dead even," but the
Pioneers simply could not score.

The Gustavus defense, led by
sweeper Jenny Schaffcr, stopped all
Grinnell rushes. Schaffer was voted
the tournament's Most Valuable
Player.

Coach Eskildsen blamed the
team’s lack of finishing ability on
both poor physical conditioning and
being too anxious to score. Overall,
though, he was "tremendously
pleased”withtheteam’sperformance
on Saturday,

Sunday‘s consolation match saw~
the Grinnell women take on abeaten ‘
up Westminster team. Westminster
had some injured players and could‘
not even field a complete squad, a,
fact that Grinnell took advantage of
early and often. ’

Grinnell displayed patience and t
worked on the “ﬁnishing” that they
failed to do the day before. The game ‘
was called toaciosewith ten minutes-‘
remaining and Grinnell leading eight _
to zero,

The goalswere scored by forwards, <
Erin Kilgore, Melanie Parsons and .
AnyaSchwartzand midfielders, Amy
Jo Reinhart and Stephanie Reisdorf, '
Schwartz scored twice. ,

The opening day loss may “serve
a purpose,“ according to Coach ‘
Eskildsen. The defeat will pose a .
different challenge than has ever
been faced by the women’s soccer ‘
team - rebounding from an early loss. *
The team‘s reaction will set the tone 1
for the remainder of the season,

The Pioneers will try to continue '
the trend on Wednesday at Cornell ,
and then travel to Augsburg this week-
end. °
