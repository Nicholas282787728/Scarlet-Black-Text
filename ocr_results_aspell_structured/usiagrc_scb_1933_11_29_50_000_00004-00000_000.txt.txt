‘Hate Between Nor

th, South Instilled

by Politicians, Historians’- Thornton

Gl‘inliell Alumnus Defends
Confederate States
in Talk Here

“The south has been the victim not
only of its sins, but of a distorted tra—
ditloll,” declared Harrison J. Thorn-
ton. assistant 'professor of history at
the University of Iowa. in a speech‘
on “The Place of the South in Amer-i
icon History" in Alumni Realtation‘
hall Monday evening.

politicians who saw the chance to
remain in power by keeping olive in-i
tcrseetional passions, and Yankee
historians who did not attempt to
understand the south'were blamed by
'Mr. Thornton for the opinion in the
north that “the south is a perpetual
troublenioker."

First in History

pointing out that four of the firs

rive presidents were southerners, and
that the first permanent colony and
first representative essemhly were in
the south, Mr. Thornton said that
the importance of the south in Amer-!
ican history has been greatly under—
estimated.

Too much blame for the Civil war
is commonly placed at the feet of the,
south, Mr. Thornton continued, stat-'
iiig that “the root of the matter wasl
in two great rival economic systems
inorthel'n industrialisin and south-

cm agi-icuiruralism." Examples irom
history were cited to show that the
south had tried to rid hcrsclf ol slav-
ery, and that the right of secession
was not exclusively a southern theory.
Compromise Possible

“Wiser leadership might have pre
vented the civil war," Mr. Thornton
declared, pointing- out that compro-
mises had been cflcctivc before, and
that slavery was abolished in Latin
America and the British colonies
without serious conflict.

“The south has established a val-
uable precedent for us in demonstrat-
ing how to enjoy leisure,” Mr. Thorns

ton concluded, in discussing the value
of southern antebellum culture.

Alter rcceivmg his B,A, degree
from Grinncll in 1925, Mr, Thornton
was awarded his MA, at Harvard
and his PhD. at the University of
Chicago. He is speaking in colleges
throughout the state as a representa-
tive of the graduate school at the
University of Iowa.
