After weathering a rough lineup of pro-conference games,
the Grinnell College softball team is preparing to sail on to the
smoother seas ofconferencc play.

Over spring break, the Pioneers faced a grueling schedule of
eight games in the Sun WestTournament at Chapman Univere
sity in Cnlifoi'nia.Thc team ended the trip with a H record, fine
ishmg on a tworwin upswing with a 14—5 win against La Sierra
University and a 34 win against Hamilton
college.

“The week went well. Our receid doesn’t
show it, but we played a lot of really tough
teams," said pitcher and inﬁelder Tess Cohen
'09.

In addition to cutting their teeth in tricky
tournament play, the Pioneers were resolving
issues of then own. There were a lot of things
that we kind of worked out over break We have a ncw coach and
we have a fairly young team with only two seniors; 'said inﬁelder
Kelsey Montgomeryt'll.

Head Coach Sandra Faulkner is new to the team this season,
having previously coached at Grinnell Community High school.

“Things are reauy going well with out new coach," Cohen
said. “She pushed us early on and demanded we play up to her
expectations despite not playing outside. Then she helped us
meet her expectations”

Montgomery expressed a similar sentiment about the new
coach.

“It's very encouraging that she’s set a really high standard for
us, but a standard that we know we can achieve. It willjust take
some work to get there," Montgomery said.

Last Satinday, the team won 4 3 against Augustana College,

ateani that had already won 14 games This is encouraging for

conference and nonconference play in the region, Montgomery
szud.

Recently, the packed schedule has pitted Grinuell against
some of the toughest teams in the Iowa Conference, including
Luther College, ranked 17th nationally among NCAA Division
III schools.

Challenging competition has not been
the only hurdle the team has come up against,
“We're playing through some adversity—one
of our stalters [Darcy Ward '09] just got hurt,"
Montgomery said.

The small team has been forced to adapt
to new positions before conference play come
mences this Friday with the game against
Knox college.

“We’re just trying to focus on getting into some kind ofa
groove for the rest of the seasoii,"Montgoiriery said.

This Thursday was the last noneconference game, versus
Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa/The team had a close
first game, barely losing 9-10.

“We played really well, although we had one bad inning mene
tally," Cohen said.

The biggest highlight of the gime was a tie that came down
to an unusual softball rule. When teams are tied at the end of
the seventh and final inning, the game goes into overtime, but
starts the eighth inning with a runner on second base.“lt's much
more fun to play when you win, but the international tiebreaker
is always a fun play because the game basically comes down to
one hit," Cohen said.

Ecuador to Grinnell, Iowa

tilt MICHAEL SCHOELZ

Ever since Juan Carlos Perez’ll picked up
a tennis racket when he was 12, he hasn’t been
able to put it down.

“Suddenly, after five months, I was practice
ing for three hours every day," Perez said.

Within four years, at the age of16,he won
the national singles championship for the
lB-and-undcr division in his home country
of Ecuador. And then he did it again as an
18syearsold

“I wasn't ranked number one for very long
’cause I lost afterwards,” he said. “But I was
ranked number one for maybe two months."

When Perez joined the Grinnell men's
tennis team as a ﬁrstj’ear last year, Coach
Andy Hamilton '85 started him at No 2 5;“,
gles. That year, Perez and the Pioneers won a
fifth Midwest Conference Championship and
made it to the second round of the NCAA
tournament, a Pioneer first.

There was no drop in the offseason as the
Pioneers have continued where they left off
Grinnell is currently ranked eighth in the re-

gion, the highest they have ever been ranked
this far into the season. While their 1377 res
cord might not jump out, they've played well
against highly ranked competition.

“I pitched a pretty difficult schedule at the
team,"Hamiltoii said. “I believe we'vc played
ten matches against nationally ranked teams
and we're 377 in those matches, but what we’ve
seen is the younger players have benefited by
the difficult schedule and the veteran players
have really stepped up."

Although he's just a second-year, Perez
is one of the veterans Hamilton vms talking
about. He now plays at No. 1 singles in the
lineup, and is ranked seventh in the region.
The top eight players at the end of the season
go to the Nationals ‘

“He's deﬁnitely our leader on the court,"
said Dan LaFountaine' 09 No. 2 singles and
No ldoubl es “He’s d to guy that when we step
out of the van and the other team looks over,
that fear is put in their eyes as he comes walk
ing on the court."

Lafouiitaine was abroad for the first so-

mester of last year, so Perez didn’t meet him
until the spring semester. But through tennis
season, he found had a connection with LIV
fountaine.

“Not only on the tennis court but of? the
tennis court, he's been a really influential pets
son on my life,m Perez said “Whenever I want
to practice a little morc,1 know I can call him
and he’ll be there."

This year, LaFountaine and Nate Fox '09
are team captains and Perez's most important
role is to win his marches. But Perez does
much more than that for the team.

"Juan is one of my best friends and one of
my favorite people in the whole world," La-
Fountaine said. “His commitment to us as
teammates is both personal as well as tennis
players. This year there seems to be something
a little bit better, a little bit different. We have
direction, we have excitement, That's some»
tlung that Juan brings."

However, LaFountarnc hasn’t been Perez’s
only mentor, Perez grew up in uito, Ec»
uridor, the same city as another Grinnellian,

Felipe Bautista 'oo. Bautista played tennis at
Grinnell and graduated in 2006 but came back
over the summer for medical school,

“He happened to live five minutes away
from my house,” Perez said. “He started
coaching at my academy, so we became really
good friends, and I had been in the process of
applying to college at that point. He helped
me out with all that stuff.“

Hamilton has coached all three players
over the years and definitely sees the impore
tance of LaFountaine and Bautista in Perez's
life.

"Inasmuch as Dan LaFountaine has been
a great mentor to Juan since he’s been here,”
Hamilton said, “Felipe has been an external
mentor that pointed him in Gtinnell's direc-
tion."

It comes at no surprise then that ofall the
great things that tennis has brought Perez, he
values the friends he’s made.

“The best part ofmy tennis life is the peo-
ple I've met» my coaches, and the people I've
been surrounded by, tennis players,': Perez said,

Jordan’s boredom

Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Baseball’s herel I
thought it would never come, The months and months
of tedious sports boredom are finally over. We thought it
would end with March Madness, but that turned out to be
a bust. Yes, Scottie Reynolds’ shot to put Villanova in the
Final Four was pretty sweet, and Western Kentucky did their
best Brady to Moss impersonation to knock off Illinois, but
the tournament was a big disappointment from beginning
to end.

I’m pretty sure the best game was Iowa State scoring
eight straight points in the final 1:25 to beat Michigan Stator
Unfortunately, that was in the women’s bracket so I’m guess-
ing the number of people that saw the game is equal to the
number of people that thought Geno Auriemma and UCO-
NN were going to bomb out in the sweet Sixteen, No need
to worry though, that‘s all over. Now it’s time for baseball
predictions.

AL CENTRAL

Obviously] need to start off talking about the Minne-
sota Twins. They would seem one of the favorites to win the
AL Central Last year it took the Whit: Sox 163 games to
knock them out oftlie playoffs, and they return almost every
member from that squad The problem is a significant reason
for their success last year is pretty unsustainablei

As a club, the Twins hit .311 with runners in scoring po-
sition. That is 24 points higher than the second place team.

is over, baseball season has arrived

Needless to say, there is no way they can duplicate that feat
this year, That coupled with what I expect to be improve
mom on behalfotthe Tigers, Royals and Indians, and a big
drop-off for the White Sex should make for a highly Cour
petitive division race with every team winning between 75
and as games,

AL EAST

There are, maybe, going to be five teams in the entire

major leagues that are going to win 90 games and three of
them are in the AL East, As much as I'd love to see the Rays
make another postseason run, I really don't see a way they
can even get there after the way the Yankees reloaded in the
off-season. Now, of course, the fact that these two and the
Red sot will be good comes as no surprise, but what makes
this division incredibly tough is how good the honour two
teams Inc.

Last year the Blue lays gave up the least amount ofruns

in the major leagues which is even more impressive consid-
ering the powerful offenses in the division. somehow they
still managed to finish seven games below their Pythagorean
Record (a formula for how many games a team should win
based on runs scored and given up), despite the fact that
such a discrepancy usually means that a team has a terrible
bullpen. The Orioles are also a team that could be much
improved this year, what with the absolute heist of prospects
they got from the Mariners for Erik Bedard, and uber pros-
pect Matt Wieters who is sure to be called up once the Orin
olcs make sure he doesn’t waste too much service time

AL WEST

Almosteveryone is picking the Angels to win the division
but I'm not buying it,They played way over their heads last
year and they lost both Mark Tebriera and Francisco Rodri—
guez. Add to that an older Vlad Guerrero and Toni Hunter,
and they have the makings ofa team that will significantly
regress from last year. This is clearly a very poor division, so
they still have a shot of winning it, but I think the Athletics
are going to progress and take it with around 84—88 wins.

You might ask, why don’t I bother writing about the Nat
tional League? Well, frankly, the Cubs are by far the class of
the league and no matter how many times in the past they‘ve
screwed up in the playoffs they're bound to make the World
Series this year . it right? Either way, I see the cubs and Red
Sox in the World Series,with the Sox winning in five games,
