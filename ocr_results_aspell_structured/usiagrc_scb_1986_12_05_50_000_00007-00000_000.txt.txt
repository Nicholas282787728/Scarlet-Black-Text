Quiet As A Mouse

by Micky Munley

Sometimes I wonder a since Grinnell
College is such a highly rigorous academic
institution, and Since. as a result. there is
an incredible amount of time devoted by
most students to the pursuit of this
academic enrichment , are we really
developing ourselves in the spirit oi a true
liberal arts educaton? Should liberal arts
be Conﬁned solely to academia or should
we reflect liberal arts in our lilestyle as
well?

It is my belief that liberal arts is allr
inclusive. Not only does it encompass
academics. but it also encompasses social
inter-action. physical development, emo-
tional health. and exposure to life in
general. Because of the high emphasis on
academics at Grinnell College, we become
too narrow in the development of who and
what we are.

I understand the nature of a college
education. and of this institution in par-
ticular, to be that academics are intended
as the primary focus. I am concerned.
however. that even mough there may be
few who are better educated than Grinnell
College graduates, few of our graduates
may be adequately prepared to tunction
within a society that most often operates
DuLside of die sphere of academia.

When I was initially considering Grin-
nell College as a high school senior. I was
particularly impressed by the statement:
“When we work, we work hard and when
we play, we play hard." Since my enroll
merit. I’ve seen this becoming less and less
true. In general, most at us carry our cone
cern with academics and academic perfor-
mance to an unhealthy extreme — “all
work and no play makes Billy a dull boy.”

It is not my intention to belittle
academia. My worry is that we focus too
much on our books and end up missing out

on the benefits available to us as members
of a diverse community. Our social well-
being surfers because we are slaves to our
classes at the expense of everything else.
Spending all weekend rereading three
books tor a test on Monday just to get an
“A" instead ol an “Ar” has its short-term
benefits. but the longterm consequences
oi missing a concert and relaxing with
triends on Friday and/or Saturday night is
much greater.

Furthermore. and all too often. I have
experienced and observed the failure or
near failure of specific events and pro-
grams on campus because people disconr
tinue their support due to academic com-
mitments. Many miss out on the opporr
tunities ot a seltagoverning student body
due to their one-track emphasis on study-
ing.

The world is a very real place. and
though it’s nice to be able to understand
and to describe it in a theoretical manner.
the theories themselves do not make the
world go around. it is a very diverse, il-
logical, subtle. and social place. To tuner
tion in it eflectively and efficiently. we
need to be experienced in operating within
its bounds and under its rules. Isolated as
it may be, Grinnell College is well equip-
ped to provide us with the experiences ap
propriate to such a task,

I'll be the lirst to admit that, perhaps,
there is an extreme in developing the non-
academlc side of liberal arts. lMy tenure
at Grinnell College is probably apt
testimony to this.) I also do not want to be
judgemental about the precise degree of
other people’s academic commitment.
Still. it is my perception that. unfortunate-
ly. the current trend at Grinnell College is
toward a more rocused and unhealthy ap-
proach to the liberal arLs.

Hey. the shuttles iinally here.

As the bus rumbles through downtown
Des Moines headed toward the interstate I
get a real ieelilig of Big City, It's that
iiightlime lceling oi being surrounded by
tall buildings. dark and narrow litters
Cluttered alleys. and unmelted clumps and
patches ol black ice in the gutters. It's an
occasional abandoned station wagon with
its miidrsplnltered windshield cracked all
across one edge lrom the round. smooth
bullet hole It‘s that sense of uneasmess
that comes or weak street lights curving in
over the sidewalk at every other corner.
and oi hair-lit wnidow displays and
storclronts locked behind steel bars or
sliding metal gates for the night. The
streets are dead, The Christmas lights are
Up

It‘s safe behind the dark. tinted windows

ing inside looking out,

There's no danger from that grizzled but
probably amiable bum down there weav-
ing along the cracked sidewalk. the one
with stumbling, clumsy ieet but unex»
pectedly quick and questing hands hungry
for any spare change, “Thsooo 1 en hall a

who probably has hidden within the many
layers of mismatched castoti clothes and
soiled coat a spare bottle ol cheap, dark,
throalrburning liquor wrapped in a greasy
brown paper bag rolled down around the
neck.

There's nothing to fear from the
slouching, ragged-around-theaedges man
who steps lrom the shadows of a darkened

store's doorway in my path. a man who is
iust as apt to ask you for a light as slice
your belly wide open with the eight inch
buck knife he's got hidden in the sleeve oi
the ill-iitting hlack overcoat he's wearing

"I can barely see the

He Snoi'ls appl'eciatlvely or even giggles
as he watches the double over and my
knees give out. i clutch the rough edge oi

The buildings ily by. My nose is pressed
against the chilled glass, A spot torms
where my breath iogs it.

The Greyhound passes in iront ol Fritz's
Bar. with its humming neon Coors Beer
sign hanging below a silvery “Happy

the big window There are metal bars
across it. The lower threerquarters of the
glass has been blacked out.

I crane my neck to watch the thick»
necked bouncer push the door to its widest
and toss a struggling. cursing patron out
on his back end. I can barely see the crowd
of curious people that drilt‘ out to the
sidewalk to watch the bruised man crawl
off. The bus pulls away.
