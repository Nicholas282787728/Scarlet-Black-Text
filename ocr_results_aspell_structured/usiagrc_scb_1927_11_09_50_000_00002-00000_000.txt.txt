PIONEER FORENSIC ACTIVITY.

Grinnell college, the Pioneer college of the west, still
has in it the spirit of initiative with ivliich it hogan.
Grinnell's latest phase or pionee ng is in tlic Ileld of
pilhlic speaking. Debating at one time may have been an
interesting form of public speaking but it has lost its
attraction. A proposed remedy, and one which otters ins
terest, is the Undergraduate Speaking exchange. These
speakers, sent out Irom this college will address the col—
lege communities which they visit, discussing topics ahoiit
which they are qualified to speak, and in which there
is student interest: they will conier with smaller groups
and individuals; they will observe conditions of student
litc. On return to the campus the spcakcr may present
publicly the tacts he will have gathered or disseminate
the results of his visit among the students as he iiishcs.

It is proposed that thc sclection at schools for this
exchange of undergradiite spcakcrs he from those
of national reputation, located in the Middle West. This

program, however, may have to he cliaugcd ii the exper-
iment proves snccossiul Instcad of only Middlc \Vcs ,

colleges, schools from different sections or the country
will have to ho taken into the exchange, in order to create
a high interest. if it is the aim or the Forensic to broaden
the speakers it sends out, and the college studcnts in
general, it can do so best by becoming acquainted with an
oiiiircly diticroiit comniiiiii Such a policy will assurc

One phase of tlic Grinlicll spirit is to undergo a rc-l

birth. A new organization on the campus is to bring
ahoilt this I‘e-birLll, but just exactly what form the organ-
ization will have, and how it will opei’atexllas not been
made clear. This organization will bring three things to

«the Grinnell spirit of loyally backing licr athletic tcains.

First, it is to generate power within the organization
itseli, then inject the spirit of the organization into the
student body winch in turn will transiusc its power into
the athletic team. When this is done, the power oi every
student in school is iighting in the team on the field.

The second thing that the new comittec is to start in
motion, is enthusiasm. This manifestation oi joy and zeal
must be present to assure the iullest amount of power.
Emerson says that, “Every great and commanding mover
nicnt in the annals oi the world is the triumph oI enthu.
siasm." *

Finally, but probably the most important (actor in
bringing about the success 01 the iirst two, is poi-screw
:tuce. There are times when misfortune and dcieat dos.
troy powcr and smother enthusiasm. At such times as
these it is perseverance that will make it possible to keep
our enthusiasm and retain our power.

Power.

Enthusiasm.

persevcrance.

it is these factors that constitute pep. And it is the
iorrnation of a ncw organization on the Grinnell campus
which can bring about a rerlurth ot the pop spirit or the
college.

Every person has pep in his litdlicrup, and it should
be the uim’and the purpose at this committee to draw this
spirit iroin the iiid‘ ' uol, not to iorcc it. Compulsory
displays oi pop, forced from the iinderclussnicu or the
uppcrclassineu is not pop, and although it bed the smile
name, it lacks outircly the whole-heartcd sp it of will
pep. The pop committcc must he a lender, not a urn-er,
if it intends to he a success.

History of Turkey
Is Traced for Club
By Mrs. C. E. Payne

At the regular meeting of the World
Followship cluh, Tuesday evening in
the Y. W. c, A. rooms, lurs. c. E. Payne
save a talk on Turkey under the div
tatorship or liloshipluil Kamal.

in thc iii-st part oi her talk, shc
traced the history at Turkey through
the Balkan wars, showing the inllile
cuccut tlic iinporialistic endeavors oi
Germany, and iinallyTurkcy's po ' on
in the "World Wltr. By 1913 Turkey
was ready tor an armistice, and the
European powers prepared the Treaty
otchvres. According to this treaty,
Armenia was to become a ircc and in.
dependent state, while the rest oi the
Turkish Empire was to be divided
among Great Britain, France, drum
and Italy.

At this point iiustaphal Kamal, a
comparatively young man but a per—
sun with great powers or leadership,
organized a grown oi people who be—
lievcd that Turkey. ii uniiicd, could be.
come a power. Their battle—cry was
“Turkey tor the Turks!" Whereupoii.
liamal began his campaigns to drive
out the Armenians. French and Ital-
ians, and to seize the city oi 3mm...
held by the Greeks. By September.
1920, he had completed this program
and had ordered’ school: Greeks to
vacate Smeroa within thirty days.
"With this order began the Near East
reiogcc problem,” lurs. Payne stated.

Kamnl‘s next objective was the ab—
ductiou oi the sultan, who represented
both the Church and the State. Within
a short time this situation was reals
ized. Following this was a second
trcaty with the allies, in which Turkey
surrendered Palestine. Syria and iii :-
opotamia, but retained all her territory
This necessitated a,
truustcr oi population between Greece
and Tiu-kcy, and since the larger
number was sent ircm 'I‘tll-kry to
Grcccc, the Near East rclioi problem
was turthor intciisilied.

president, and its capitol at Angora.
