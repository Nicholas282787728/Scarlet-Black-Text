Roomdraw: Advice
from a Sen1or

Marc Bass

For seniors, this time of year
holds a special pleasure that our
underclasspeople iriends just can‘t
understand. While about 900 people
went to their mailboxes a few
weeks ago and found a blue packet
that had printed on it in bold print:
“HOUSING PACKET,” we seniors
had nothing. Part of that, ol
course. is that by the time one
becomes a senior, most of the old
friends at home have completely
forgotten that we even exist. But
still, the joy of not having to go
through room draw can only be
matched by the knowledge that we
won't have to go through pre-
registration, either.

Now, although i do not have a
great number of freshmen/women
or sophomore friends, I have been
asked a number of times by my
younger friends where I think they
should live, As a senior who has liv»
ed on both North Campus and
South Campus, I feel that I am fair
ly qualified to give some advice on
this topic. So what I propose to do
here is to give an unbiasedanalysis
oi the dorm life. Without further

' delay. let‘s jump right into this.

Perhaps we should start with the
most basic of concepts: How does
the North Campus atmosphere
compare to that of the South Cam-
pus dorms? I Will disregard the
classical stereotypes of the “cone
servative North Campus jock" and
the "liberal South Campus Bohe-
mian." and try to get at more
serious matters. Let‘s face it.
folks, dorm life is dorm life!
Perhaps the only notable dif-
ference between North and South
on this issue is money. Yes, that's
right! You See. some oi the North
dorms have a significantly higher
proportion oi froshrsoph to junior
senior that South Campus dorms.
what does all this youth enrolled in
100- and Zoorlevel classes add up
to? Lots oi free time. and all that
free time means a whole lot oi
horse play, and as anyone who has
lived In Norris or Younker (or
some of the other primarily

‘ freshman dorms) knows. the com-
_ munity breakage level can be very
high! So. if you are into keeping
(your continuingrenrollment
deposit in good shape, live South
‘ ADVANTAGE 7 SOUTH.
Food. glorious food! Well. not
’ here at Grinncll College. Since
_ both dining halls serve the same
meals tseemingiy day after dayl.
we can not use this category for
chosing where to live. However. if
you are from Chicago, you know
that the better food is south at
V Comlskey Park. In Grinnell,
. however. Cowles and Quad serve
the same chow. ADVANTAGE 7
. NONE.
We might not be able to judge the
r dining halls on quality of food. but
we can judge them on other
grounds, and I will attempt to do
that here. First things first: the
line. No doubtabout this. the line at
a Quad is shorter, and it moves
faster with lewer break-ins.
Aesthetics is a big thing to con-
sider. Seeing that all the dorms
basically look the same irom the
‘ inside, the dining halls help define
what it is to be a North or South
Campus person. Cowles has some
nicely colored banners hanging
irom the ceiling (“And I don't
‘ know why!"), and Quad has deep,
rich, natural wood paneling. Quad
wins again. The social atmosphere
at Quad is great, you are forced to

eat with at least seven other peo
ple, many oi whom you don't know
or perhaps don’t even like. Damn
it! “You will be Iriends,even if you
don't want to be!" Cowles has big
tables that allow you to be social,
or small tables to allow for in:
tlmacy (as much as any dining hall
can provide) No doubt, this is a
vote for CowleS. Ahh. but the most
important thing to consider is the
checkers. Quad has Darcy, and
Cowles has Sneila. No contest
here; Cowles is the big winner. AD-
VANTAGE 7 NORTH.

As my one-time mentor. Deb
Hirshtield, was fond of saying.
”Okay, people, let's get down to
business!” This is where the real
fighting begins. How can anyone
hope to discuss dorm life without
discussing the loggias'! Much like
the dining-hall controversy, the
loggia question is multifaceted. so
let's try to be brief in every
category. Seeing that spring is
coming, we should discuss the
most important thing first — lannr

.iingl There arethose who will say
that you must have a lounge chair
on the loggia to get a select tan,
and we all know that the southern
loggia is slanted and not well-
suited for furniture, but this does
not make North the better tanning
location. Let‘s face it, prime lann'
ing hours are 10am. to 2p.m. Now
if you live on North. then at least
two oi the best tanning hours are
blocked by the buildings. This may
also be true for South Campus, but
with a western exposure you can
tan until 5 pm. Besides. how many
people are willing to get up at
seven in the morning to start tann~
ing on North Campus? in my Uplr
nion. South gets this important
category. Similarly. North does
get a big vote for having a flat log»
gia; it is perfect (or loggia parties
and barbecues, But where South
Campus really ﬂexes its loggia
muscles is in the Winter. which
here in Central Iowa is about two
years long it may be wimpy, but
the enclosed loggia is indeed a
great thing. ADVANTAGE —
SOUTH.

Let us now CDnSlder one of the
last things. rooms with a view. I
admit to be biased on this one. but I
will do my best to judge beyond my
blindness and get a glimpse of
truth if you live up north on the
loggia side, you get to see Mac
Field. This is an exciting thing.
especially in the early part of first
semester and in the spring when
lots of people are outside dressed
very scantily, There is ultimate
and softball and lots of other
games going on. No argument
here; this is a lot of fun. On South
Campus loggia side there are lots
of trees. One can also play
ultimate: however. it is a little
more dangerous due to the trees
and sidewalks, but the Volleyball
courts are also fun to watch.
assuming that they are being used.
During the (all and winter, South is
a litﬂc bit prettier than North, but
North is nicer in the warmer
weather. [can‘t makes [air call on
this one; it is up to you to decide.
What I can judge is the view from
the street-side rooms. South
overlooks the parking lot that is
East Street, ugly houses, and a
relatively bland church. North
Campus overlooks tree-lined Park
Street, and much fewer cars. Also

Looking upon Pride Week
as a Celebration of Identity

Todd M. Brown

I've never written a public jour-
nal entry before, but, as the cliche
goes, there‘s a first time for
everything. Usually, I write very
personal shit in this precious book
of mine. Well. it won't be any dilr
ferent this time. because it‘s my
life we're dealing with here, I’m
gonna lay down on paper just what
all you people who want me to die
will never get up the nerve to ask
me.

This entry was triggered by
somebody's report to me that, in-
deed. a “no lags" sign had ap-
peared outside the door of one or
my dormamates' rooms. I guess
you could say that I was not amuSA
ed. Before I start. I'll just say that
this entire letter is unplanned. It is
purely a spontaneous emotional
reaction, meant to educate those
people who probably will not even
lower themselves to read this
because it is written by one of those
people who they wish could no
linger lift her arm to write.

Let me tell you a story or two. I
was conscious of my feelings very
early on, maybe before i was even
in school. However, l knew nothing
of the Implications. What I did
learn concurrently was that no
feelings like the ones I felt should
ever he discussed, not even with
parents. I considered it a phase out
of which I would soon grow. By
about third grade, everybody was
sensitive to the words “fag“ and
.“homo "VI.took part In the festive
name-Calling with enthusiasm. Lit:
tle did I know that my selfresteem
was being eaten away at its base.

By junior high I was taking part
in the so ’al antics present in the
communities of lZ-yearblds, due
to peer pressure. It didn't last long,
and the last girl I dated was in
Sixth grade, By this time I knew
that I was Sexually attracted to
men but still had no idea about
what it would mean in my life.

By the time I realized what I was
in for. I Was in a horrlble state. Let
me tell you the circumstances.
Think of this: I Could not talk to
anybody about my feelings
because from every direction i
learned that they were evil,
perverse, unnatural, decadent.
and that I was destined to live a life
of disease, unfulfilled and isolated
l was therefore constantly
petrified of being rejected. There
were absolutely no positive role
models for me to possibly feel
otherwlse. Clearly, I did my best to
conceal myself.

When I was a junior I had so
many defenses up that I couldn't
communicate with anybody. with
propaganda coming irom all sides
telling me that I Should hate
myself tor feelings that i could not
change and for which I was not
responsible. I inevitably internalize
ed the message. Consequently. I
was so selﬁhatelul that all my ac-
quaintances thought that I was cer
tainly going to slit my wrists. A
good example of my selfconcept
was my portrayal oi myself when l
attempted to tell my best friend
what was up with me. of course I
couldn't. for fear of rejectionButI
was able to hint and give him a few
vague clues. The message he
received? He thought that I was
dying of a terminal illness, Mean
while, my grades went down to a
1.8 and l was severely depressed. l

attended expensive therapy ses»
sions on a regular basis.
Sometimes I thought about my
destination: hell. Well, I thought, ii
I am destined for eternal hell-fire,
it won’t be so bad. ‘cause I already
live there.

It has taken me four years of
constant work to convince myself
that indeed I am a good poison:
iour years to feel like my feelings
could possibly be good and natural.
But I‘m still working against
everything this society has to oiier.
It's a lifelong process, and many
people can never do it. They can
never come out and ieel good about
themselves. They have to hide
from their true feelings and be
miserable their entire lives
because ot the people who terrorize
us and the society which ‘tells us
not to bother living, but to go
straight to hell. You can’t get rid of
me, or any oi us. You cannot
repras us and make us change
Just as we can't do it to you.
There's no need to put up signs
You're already punishing us 24
hours a day. l have to hide myself
from people 1 know and meet
because no human being could
stand the rejections that I would
encounter ii I did not. Well, I can
confidently say that you are
fighting a iutile battle. Africanr

This is my only life, as far as I
know. I'm really sick oi having to
validate my existence. Why should
I even have to write this tricking

letter? Because I remember that
last year somebody writing for the
Outcry scoifed at the notion of Gay
Pride Week. I hope people can see
now that it's nothing to he laughed
at. There are iew things more im-
portant than being proud of
yourself.

You can put up as many signs as
you want. It might hurt me per-
sonally, but I won't change. in tact.
it seems that putting up these signs
is just cruelty. Itserves no purpose
but to hurt people. How nice, And I
don't think and you Shouldn't think
that I'm some sort of intense
revolutionary. I'm just some guy
with a real life who reacts to his
life situation in a completely valid
way. No one can give me any shit
for that. I know that being gay has
made me one oi the most honest
men I know. l may be bitter, but
I'm honest.

Where is this leading? Nowhere
The people who should read this
won't. My iriends will read this
and will pseudocsupport me.
Others will try to befriend this
militant gay guy to display to
others their own openamindedness.

 

Think of this: Icould not tulle to any
body about my feelings because from
every direction I learned that they were

evil, perverxe, unnatural, decadent, and
that I was destined to live a life of

disease, unfulfilled and isolated.

 

Americans and Women have won
their battles and will continue to
do so. Gays and lesbians will, too
You cannot stop this inevitable
progress. Just let me tell you that l
threaten you much more than you
threaten me, And when I see a sign
like the one I saw today i think,
“The person who did that is just
stupid." And even though that is
self-righteous, ldon't care because
I'm pissed off and i know that I'm
a good person and can lead a
healthy and natural life and that
I'm very self-aware and am not
deluding myself about my feelings.
i know that positive role models
exist, and that gay and lesbian pear
ple are an integral part of every
segment of our society. Yes, we
are even to percent of your football
team. So don't make assumptions,
When people assume I'm not gay
and made a rude statement they
insultme andl feel it. i do feel your
punishments. You don't say “nigr
ger” in front oi an African.
American. But nobody has their
gayness imprinted in their skin cola
or. Do you know how much it hurts
when you assume that people
around you aren't gay and you
make harsh comments? it hurtsl
Are you satisfied? I’m already in
hell and now you are tlogging a
dead horse,

God. I don't know what the hell
I‘m trying to prove or who I'm try-
ing to threaten anymore. The point
is that I am a real~life person with
real-life feelings and this real life
I'm living wants me to ieel like shit
about myself. I won't stand for it.

An important thing I want to add
is that I‘m not always like this. I

possible, It‘s not for sympathy.
