Blevins begins his dive by adjusting the
bounce level of the one-meter board.

The full twist will rotate Blevins 360 de-
grees in the air.

Blevins walks out to the edge of the board
and prepares for the dive: a full twist.

I’ve never been prouder ro be a Nebmskan.

First, Nebraska cornbusleer quarrerbaek Eric croueh wins rhe
Heisman Trophy Then we ger rhe ehanoe to play Miami {or rhe
college roorbali narional ehampionship. Few Husker
rans oould have asked for anyrhing more.

Thars nor why I‘m so happy To hail rrom rhe
birthplace orArbor Day and KnoleAjd. rhough.

I'm proud because rhe Huskers will be playing in
the Rose Bowl Presented by AMT.
is could have been a lor worse.

When Nebraska lost to Colorado a

' few weeks ago, I feared the Huskers
would have ro playrn oneorrheworsr
games known ro eollege roorball_a
srupidly named bowl. Now, nor only is Nebraska playing in rhe only
corporalcly»sponsorcd bowl where rhe eompany ar leasr has rhe do.
eoney ro aide in name at the and, it’s playing in rhe game sponsored
by one or my ravorire releeommuniearions firms.

l srill feel sorry ror all rhose orher reams who gor stuck in bowl

two balls, no strikes

games whose names I can't say wirhour rolling my eyes. There’s she
Visir Florida Tangerine Bowl. The Chik-Fil-A Peach Bowl. The
lnsighuom Bowl and, my personal favorite, mecalleryhrruirureeom
Bowl.

_l mn’t undersrand how bowl names got to be so mueh like com-
martials. I remember when I was growing up. rhe only bowl games
were rhose named after rruir, rash crops and ﬂowers. Even irrhese
games did have a eorporare sponsor, rhe company name was some.
how disguised in rhe bowl's logo, For yearsl used ro rhink FedB< was

sramped on all orangn because of rho
Peder orange Bowl.

Now bowl games have gorren our
of hand. Everyone from banks to
Internet srarnups is sponsoring a

game. Even worse, rhey're being blaranr abour rheirsponsorship. They
pur rhe company name ﬁrsL They make eoaehes wear silly hars with
rheir logo on ii, They insist rhar a represenrarive from the company
be on hand ro eongrarulare the winner at rhe end orrhe game, even if
[he represenrarive has never seen a college roosball game‘ and keeps

Iiﬁg

referring ro rhe winning ream as "those big guys wirh rhe pads and
srurr."

1 reel bad for rhe reams rhar have to play in rhose bowls. Sure,
some players and eoaehes may be happy so gar ro play in any bowl
game arall. bur l'd rarher be eurled up in front bra warm ﬁre Dee. 25
rhan playing in she sega Spam Las Vegas Bowl. Besides, I've always
been a Ninrendo man myself.

I suppose rhars why eompanies waur ro sponsor bowls, though:
us good adverrising and ir helps rhem gain an advanrage on rheir
eomperirion. I remember rhere was a rime when I didn’t even know
Galleryhrrnirureeona exisred, Now l’m shinleng orbuying a $2000
bed from rhem, even iru won'r hr in my dorm room. And iusr be.
eause lhaven’ryer riguredour wharAXA (ofAXA Liberry Bowl rsme)
sells doesn't mean I don’t wanr ro buy in

l have a bad feeling rhar bowl games are going ro beeome even
more eommereial as rime goes on. Soon, every mom-and»pop dime
srore will have rheir very own bowl wirh rheir very own logo and
rhelr very own slogan.

No. rhe crinnolledu Bowl eannor be far olr.
