The Pioneers’ inability to cap»
italize on their opponent’s mis-
takes coupled with an incon-
sistent onensive attack allowed
St. Olaf to roll over Grinnell
here Saturday, 29—7, in the Pine
neers’ last home football game
of the 1953 season.

St. Olnf fumbled the ball to
the Ploneers a total of ﬁve
times throughout the contest,
but Grinnell could score only
once. That one time was mid-
way in the ﬁrst quarter when
the Oles fumbled deep in
their own territory and Grin—
‘nell managed to push the hall
across the goal by Jim Low-
‘ry’s one-yard plunge. The ex-
tra point attempt by Copeland

.was good, and (irinnell led,

7-0.

However, ircrn this point on,
it was almost all S/ts Olaf. The
Oles quickly recovered from
their lethargy and, in their ﬁrst
series of plays after the kickoﬁ,
end Dave Robison eluded the
Pioneer secondary and received
a forward pass from back
Wayne Simpson in a play good
for a total of 47 yards and a
St. Olaf touchdown. This con—
cluded the scoring for the ﬁrst
half. During the remainder of
the half, neither team could un-
leash a long scoring drive due
to the tightening of both de»
fenses.

The second half was marked
by an ever~increasing show of
offensive strength by St. Olaf
and a weakening of Grinnell‘s
defense lrom its good ﬁrst-
half showing. In the third
quarter,quarterba.ckNate
Schultz scored on a sevenryard
- run and, in the fourth quarter,
Nate Aus and Bob Algae
crossed the goal line for the
Oles after runs of three and
seven yards respectively. Grin—
'nell‘s remaining drives were
stopped short of the goal by
either a stout Ole deiensc, an
untimely fumble or an inter-
cepted pass.

In the statistical department,
St. Olaf outgained Grinnell 240
yards to 113 on the ground,
while Grinnell bettered St. Olaf
in passing yardage, 103 to 62.
However, the Oles earned 15
ﬁrst downs as compared with
only 12 for the losers.

broke the course record or

15:08.5 and Moe was close at

really hurt the Pioneers was
the fact that a St. Olaf man,
Norm Rustad. took third place.

Grinnellians To

In Lasl' Game Of '58 Season

by Dale Furnish \
The often down-but-not-yet-out

Grinnell answer the bell in

their final chance of the season to throw/a knockout punch
against a favored opponent. Undefeated Coe college, which
backed into the Midwest Conference title last weekend
when Cornell fought to a draw with once beaten Carleton
and ellminated the latter from the championship picture,
has rolled over seven straight opponents thus fill' and hopes
to make the Pioneers its eighth victim

There is nothing but respect
for the high—flying Kohawks in
the Grinnell camp. Coe runs the
same offense that Iowa univer—
sity has utilized in gaining the
top of the Big rren this year:
the wing—T. But Grinnell‘s Coach
Peterson makes it very plain
that it is not any specific for-
mation that is responsible for
Coe’s success, but a definite
wealth oi talent, particularly in
the backfield.

Jerry stonebarger, at our-
terhnck, is rated one of the
best all-round backs in the
conference. He is backed up
by three superlative halibucks
and a two—man fullback set-
up. lusty Watson and Ron,
Armstrong get the starting
nod at the halts and Bob Top-
ping and Eldon Pyle aiternate
in the fullback slot. Peterson
describes this set of banks as
a group to notch sheer speed
with any other in the league.

Daplte all this evidence in
his favor, Coe coach Wally
Schwank is not looking for a
pushover against Grinnell. After
scouting the Pioneers in the st
our contest, he said, “You have
an outstanding ‘back in Cope—
land. He does a good job under
pressure. Van Anrooy is a good

Face Kohawks

football forces of
Cedar Rapids tomorrow for

receiver, runner, blocker and
tacklel‘. LoWry is a good inside
threat. lVe think it will be a

tough game.” '

Eleven senior performers
will he working‘to bow out
with a victory after a disap-
pointing season. It could be
done since (Joe is a team
noted for its close decisions
and has shown itself thus far
to have the knack of scoring
just as many points as are
necessary to win. Five of the
Kohawk victories have been
by the margin of one touch-
down or less.

With the conference title in
their hip pocket the Cedar Rap—
ids coilegians may ease up just
enough so as not to score the
minimum points needed for the
expected win. In any case it
will take concentrated play and
correction of the mistakes that
handicapped the Pioneers against
St. Olaf if Grinnell is to win.

Senior tailback John Copelandl
goes into the final game at his'
collegiate career needing 64
yards to establish a new season
record for total offense. He setl
the present record last yearl,
when he piled up 1042 yardsl
running and passing. '
