Computer catalog system
demonstration in Burling

by Seth Peterson

The administrators of Burling
Library would appreciate your
help in selecting an automation
system next week. Last spring,
the Board of Tmstees appropriated
sufficient funds speciﬁcally for
the purchase of such a system,
which is essentially a
computerized card catalog. The
amount appropriated has not been
disclosed. However, Librarian of
the College, Christopher McKee,
said that the sum is comparable
to the amount spent on books
and periodicals each year. He
stressed that the appropriation for
automation is entirely separate
from the funds allocated for these
materials.

According to Gail Bonath.
Assistant Librarian for Technical
Services, automation offers sev-
eral advantages over the present
card catalog. For instance. there
are a variety of ways to search for
a particular text using
automation: author/title search,
key word, and subject search. All
of this is done by giving a data
base the appropriate commands.

Once a search has been
performed, individuals will
receive a printout of the items
yielded and their call numbers.
Another advantage of an
automated system is that it is
more easily updateable. In con-
trast to card catalogs, which must
be laboriously updated by hand,
automated systems can be updated
by typing a change and
instructing the computer to carry
this out for the whole system, in
much the same way that one
changes the spelling of a word
throughout acompuler file.

Five companies visited the
college over the summer to
demonstrate their respective
automation systems. Three of
these have been eliminated. The
two remaining companies are
Carlyle and Innovative Interface.
both located in the San Fransisco
bay area. Carleton. Colgate and
Macalastcr Colleges have the
Carlyle system, while Welleslcy.
Kalamazoo and Lafayette have the
Innovative Interface system.
McKee said that there are three

main considerations in the
selection process: first, the
quality of the software and the
ease of use; second. the ﬁnancial
stability of the company and its
reputation among former cus—
tomers and, finally. the price of
the system. Carlyle and Innova»
live Interface will be visiting
campus to demonstrate their
systems for the third time next
week, and students are urged to
attend as the two systems will be
available for hands-on trial.
Evaluations will be available for
each and McKee promises to,
"read every evaluation sheet ﬁlled
out." He hopes to then make a
selection within the subsequent
two weeks. The tentative
schedule for installation includes
establishing a data base for staff
in the spring, bar-coding of the
entire Burling collection over the
summer, and availability for

student use bv next fall. ‘

McKibbin landscapes
"a kind of celebration"

by Tom Wickersham and Dun
Capone

Currently on display at the
OlsoneLarsen Galleries in Des
Moines are new works by Robert
McKibbin. associate professor of
art here at Grinnell College. The
exhibit, which consists of
fourteen works, most of which
were completed over this past
summer, opened last Saturday.
September 10th, with a gallery
talk given by McKibbin.

In his talk McKibbin spoke
of his education, his work, and
his love for pastel and for
landscape: McKibbin began
teaching at Grinnell in 1976,

after completing an MFA at
Miami University in Ohio. His
MFA thesis work was in abstract
printmaking; and although he has
shifted his interests and is now
working primarily in pastel and
from life. his earlier interests can
be seen in the emphasis he places
on working with and pushing
certain formal elements. such as
color.

Although for McKibbin.
"working from life is a kind of
celebration," he has recently he
gun working from photographs.
In fact, all fourteen works in the

current show (lwclvc pastels and
two oil paintings) were done
from photographs and sketches of
places McKibbin had visited.
The use of photographs has
allowed him to much more
effectively capture momentary
shifts in the environment he is
painting. [It also allows him to
work in the comfort of his
relatively recently completed (air
conditioned) studio, rather than
the outdoors]

McKibbin's use of pho—
tographs has also facilitated his
recent interest in "open space"
landscape. This interest in the
depiction of open space can best
be seen in his two pastels of an
upstate New York lake: "View
of Lake Sacandaga" and
"Sacandaga Lake". As opposed
to many earlier works where the

were yelling something. They
pulled up right next to us. about
a foot away from me and were
saying. Hey baby. Hey, what's
going on? Hey, how're you
doing? Hey, hey baby, hey
baby} So. we drove away and
they followed us for like three or
four tums. It was really obvious
they were following us, because
they were really close behind us.
So I decided to drive to the police
station. When I took a left
(down to the station), they went
straight ahead." Slivinskv also
commented that at this time. at
three in the morning, both doors
to Younker were propped open.
In a case of harassment by
townspeople, the matter should
be reported to the police
department as well as Student
Affairs. Crady said that an
incident should be reported even
if it seems to be a small matter. i
"It might be happening a lot oft
the time (with the same
vehicles)," he said. "If (the
students) can get the license,
plates. that would be very ‘
helpful. We just simply need the
information," he said. l
; The apparent concern with l
i harassment andspossibloassaultl
! has people considering changes
on campus. Both Crady and
‘ SGA President Greg Evans
. discussed setting up an escort

‘ meeting was to set up groups for

running and bicycling, since
most routes mn along Penrose
St. and other fairly unpopulatcd
areas. A day before the meeting,
Jim Gilbert, softball and assistant
football coach said, "People
ought to know not to go up there
(Pcnrose) alone."

Evans and Clady have planned
an open fomm for Monday night
at 7:30 in South Lounge to
discuss assault and harassment.
Representatives from tltc Grinnell
Police Department, the Rape
Crisis Center, and the Women‘s
Group will be involved, All
