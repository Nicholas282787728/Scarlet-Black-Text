QED ituriul

”An Appreciaiion”, by Rev. Fallon

The following is from the pen oi
Rev. C. H. Patton, of the American
Board, who spoke to the Associations
here January 31. It. was published in
the issue for February 2' of the “Cour
greguciouallsn and Christian World",
and takes great signiﬁcance from this
fact. as well as the {zoo that. it; comes
from Dr. Patton. Such A shatemenh
means much to Iowa College for in is
an Impartial expression of a true
situation.

“The ﬁnest bhing I heard on a ﬁve
weeks‘ trip rhrcugh the middle
Western States, was the singing by
students of Iowa. College at. Grinnell,
of Dr. Mahhescn’s hymn, “0 love that
wilt not. let. me go”. It was inspiring
beyond expression. Why can’t our
oongregziious sing that way? What
are the elements which make for
such singing and why don b We clllLi-
Vibe (hem in our churches? Iowa
College, by the way, is one or the
most. encouraging spots in Congrega-
tionalism today. There is an earnest.
Christian spirii. there which ﬁlls one
with gratitude and hope. There is a
passion for service. Instead of look-
ing for places of emolument and
honor where they can gel. much, they
are led to seek those places where
they can give much.

place of the college man and woman
in respect to this form 01 social work.
Rev. Dana‘s study is based upon it
great. deal of practical experiences iii
solving the dilliculbies and evils of a
country town. The conditions he
presented were all such as are met
with in evory rural discricl. and which

concerned cover the religious. social,
economic and political sides or the
questions. The call in each case is
ior united action under competent.
leadership against the antagonism to
good and indiﬂereuce to rem-m which
oeseis every community.

The talks were probably the most.
practical and pointed given in the
series, for they have indicated a
way in which college people in

society wherever they are, without.
undertaking any special line of social
study and service. For this reason
they probably appeal more directly to
