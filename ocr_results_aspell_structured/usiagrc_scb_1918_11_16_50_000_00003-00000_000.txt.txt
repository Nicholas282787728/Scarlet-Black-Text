SDGIAL REVULUTIDN WARS
RESULT-nil. I]. GRIFFITH

Prolessor D. D. Griffith returned
yesterday train a week's stay in Wash-
ington, D. 0.

While there, he was engaged in war
work in the offices of the general
stall, and would have continued the
work had not an ormisticc been de-
clared. With the signing of the armise
tlcc; authoiiics decided to give no
more commissions and to enter immer
diotely upon the process or reducing
the departments to a minimum work-
ing force. As it is Professor Griffith
will continue his work in Griilnell one
loss he is again summoned.

“One thing that impressed me the
strongest while in the east," he said
in an interview this morning, ”is the
fact that the war is not yet over—it
is simply shifted to another ﬁeld;
there is an incredible amount or work
to be done beiorc law and order are
established.“

it is his belief, he states, that the
ordnance departments, and the tank
and aviaiion services will be drasti—
cally reduced in the near future. but
that the majority of our soldiers now
in France will be retaiued lhcrc for
two years or more. It is also pos-
sible, he believes, that the next ten
years may se a, social revolution, both
here and in Europe, which has never
been equalled in the world: its out-
eomc depending largely on the inteiii»
gence of the middle classses.

can. They’ll probably get there, too,
although they've been told a dozen
times collectively and individually that

"A little While belore We left Sa-
mars we entertained Tchetchek, the

Cossacks and new army. Mr. Hudlcy,‘
an American consul, was visiting at‘
our housc and wanted to interview this
gentleman on numerous matters. So
I had to prepare the food tor our hon— l
cred guest. We didn’t dare have al
vcry iussv meal as I was chief cook
and bottle Washer, owing to the fact‘
that our cook had lelt the week be—
fore. So we had a very simple renast.
We had a Very green maid and in the
excitement she managed to spoil every—
thing I didn’t. I shivered when he
ate the salad, which I knew would kill
almost anybody because it contained
too much of this peculiar Russian vin-
egar, and I was truly worried When
he began to eat the pressed chicken,
because it is always a risk to eat
pressed Chicken under the best. con-
ditions. But when we had passed this
part of the slipper and launched into
chocolate ice cream I began to take
heart, especially when he accepted a
second helping.

NOVEMBER lItli, 1918.
I woke to a mighty chorus
or the army of the dead.
The sunshine burst. into my heart:
"The War is over," men said.

Again the song of triumph,
“Count cheap theprice we paid":
While men on earth responded.
"We live now unafraid.”

Proud of the flags thatfougbt .
Through blood to victory.
The earth with song is jubilant.
And full of peace is the sea.
