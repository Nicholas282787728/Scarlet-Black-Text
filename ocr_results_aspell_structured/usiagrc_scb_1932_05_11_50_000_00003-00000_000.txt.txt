(Continued from page 1)
Jayhawk classic. Oklahoma A. is M.
teams were third in the half mile and
fourth in the 4:10. Grinnell's classy
one-mile relay team finished third at
the Drake relays while the Bulldogs
pulled a surprise at their own meet
by putting a second-place fouramlle
quartet on the track. All this augurs
for close competition in the relays
and track events at the Valley meet,

Gram-rid Favored

The Valley loop will have a fine
set of javelin throwers. Groflund of
Grinnell placed third at the Drake
relays while King of Drake qualified
but did not place. Rigney of Okla-
homa A. & M. was fourth at Kansas.

One of Creighton's most probable
point—winners is Larry Paben. a
spear tosser. Fred Blanck of Drake,
who grabbed a fourth place in the
shotput on his home ground last
week. is a favorite in his specialty.
Earl Harlan, also of Drake, is the
probable discus winner.

Orchestra Leader Falls
Hard for Grim-tell Coeds

car-l Moore, grinning director of
the orchestra which furnished the
music for the {ninth annual Brown
Derby Drag, Saturday in thc men’s
gymnasium, apparently was impress
ed by the pulchritude of the Grinnell
coeds.

Talking to a member of The soar»
lot and Black staff. who incidentally
was one of the several to seek Mr.
Moore's autograph, he burst forth
with “I see thousands of beautiful
women every night, while playing at
the Drake hotel, but they'd have to
go a long way to beat the girls I've
seen here tonight."

The diminutive “Deacon” appeared
to like everything about Grinnell,
and promised to dedicate a piece to
the Brown Derby Drag, when he re
turns to the Drake hotel, Chicago,
June 6. He took with him a copy of
“Sons of old Grinnell", college song,
which he intends to include in his
arrangement of a college medley.
