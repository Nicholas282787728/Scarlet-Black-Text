Women capture division title

by Jenny Phibbs

There is more to the Grinnell College
women's swim team than van accidents
and exotic trips south. One cannot ignore
as impressive record that extends back
through the past five years. Last Saturday,
at the Division III Conference Champio -
Ship, the Grinnell women captured first
place ior the fifth consecutive year by a 200
point margin. One swimmer, Captain Petr
ny Bates, qualified for the Division liI Na-
tionals in the 400 individual medley.

Head Coach Martha Rowedder believes
that there are several reasons for the swim
team‘s yearly successes. “We Wm meets
because of our depth. The number of swim-
mers on the team is unusually large."
There are nineteen Women on the team.
three of them divers. This number gives
swimmers with diiiering strengths a
chance to compete in the events in which
their expertise will allow them to both exc
cel and to produce the best results for the
team.

Rowedder, herself a swimmer out of the
University of Delaware, accepted her first
coaching job iour years ago at Grinnell.
“We get good swimmers irom all over the
United States. Our program is impressive,
and this becomes an asset when recruiting
prospective students." Indeed. freshman
comprised over half the team this year.
due undoubtedly to dogged recruiting.
Rowedder added, ”I like the small school
aspect here. I'd like to think It's my
coaching that has helped the team acquire
the conference titles."

Although the women lead the pack in
their division, they do compete with both

Division I and 1! schools where the come
petiton proves tougher. Their dual meet
record this year was 374, and in both the
Pioneer Relays and the Miracle Relays
they placed third,

However, within the squad itself the
season has been one of recordrbreaking. At
the first meet five records were broken
Freshman Meg Philpott broke her
freestyle record several times, and Joan
Lewis, also a freshman, reduced her times

Captain Lynn Dixon hopes to see a
greater feeling of unity among the team
members next year. She was, nonetheless,
proud of the individual mutiviation present
in most of the swimmers, “It takes a lot of
discipline to go to practice each day.
Everyone worked hard, and a lot of
freshmen came outwith better times."

One may scoff at Grinnell athletics, but
the swim teams have consistently stood as
an exception to a proudly held attitude that
loss is inevitable for Grinnell athletes. The
women's swim team is a Wmmng group of .
competitors worthy of recognition and ap7
preciation.
