THE in?) ON 01" “PKHPT’JNG'

The “What Do You Think” article in Wednesday's
issue oi the Scarlet and Black was most effective. l\'hlle
the argument. and attitude pf the freshman, "A Gl'ilmellr
iau," stand open to considerable cr ism. we are thank-
ful that the writer had taken enough time to give thought
to the matter and enough nerve to state his conclusions.
Whether we agree with him is another matter we don't;
but the crust of this smug atmosphere of selfrsntisfactiml
which has settled so solemnly over the campus has ﬁnally

been broken—some one does care about something lifter
all.

than the whole practice is worth Perhaps we have
ti en the “rang slant on this matter; we're open to con—
viction. So far, we are illi\\'lllii\g to change our minds.

The problem which has a son the past week in ii
particular building where freshmen outiinmhci- ripper-
classiiien and have-revolted against the orders at
uppcrclassmen, is one which must he handled hr student
government. if the Men‘s Senate cannot give proper
authority to the house chairman and the upper-clossincn.
the student government system is at fault ll‘ the reg...
lotions imposed on the lreshmen arc unjust, now is the
time tor a show down, it ericvances ill'e to he hired.
this is the proper moment.

At the meeting ot the Men's Senate chnosdny ever
hing, practically cvcry man declared himself in favor of
the paddle, at least to a moderate dcgiee if that feeling
is the exhressronotan iippcrcla .roup.representative ol'
the student body, why not declare that sentiment? There
is no reason to be ashamed; our consciences are
that sensitive.

Two years ago we bashed and rciiashcd the question
or “prepping" und paddlingiwe almost tired of it. Yet,
if a group of troshmeii get together (the majority or thc‘
building), and refuse to execute the orders of the upper~
classmen, what is to he done?

lilimlty will necessarily have to he delegated and a
definite stand taken on “pi-eppins" and paddling by the
Men's Senate. Let that body adopt its conclusions, put
teeth in its decree and see that the rules are ellfor'fictl.
if the Honor G club is to tdlie complete charge or the
situation in the iuturo, all right, it would seem, from
our 53 stem of government, that the Men's Senate should
be the logical group. A. c. i
