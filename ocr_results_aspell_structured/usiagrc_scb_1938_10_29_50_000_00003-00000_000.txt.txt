Gernmnized Europe [5
Nat Imﬁassible~Seger

“Europe will he Cermanized Una
less something happens to Hitler.
unless a financial crisis brings
about a weakening of his political
regime, or unless the democracies
of‘Europe make up their minds to
recognize the vcry character of
Europe,” Dr. Ger-hart H. segerex-
plained yesterday, in his address
in Herrick Chapel.

Dr, seger was the second speak—‘
or of the Grinnell International
Relations conference for 1938,

Herr Hitler is in power not bee
cause of a majority vote of the
people but through the vote of a
Reichstag, crippled by the loss of
several members whose arrest he
had ordered, Dr. Sager said.

Hitler has complete control ofl

even the private life of the indiv-
idual German.

Through the institution of Pro
tectivc Custody, Hitler is sending
to prison and to concentration
camps thousands who dare express
themselves as unsympathetic with
the ruling political party, this
without legal procedure.

Thus, there have been five at~
tempts to end Hitler’s life.

 

The European democracies don‘t

try to recognize that there is al

difference between the ethical
standpoint of a Nazi and of a
gentleman, Dr. Seger said.

The British government seemsi

to be trying to satisfy Germany,
at the expense of Soviet Russraﬂ
but Hitler won't ever be satisfied,
he concluded.

2:2:
Loves Blames Failure

Of League on Fear

That nations were atraid to inter—
fere was the principal cause of the
failure of the League of Nations
and World Court during the post
war period until the Munich treaty
in 1933, said Dr. Walter H. c.
Laves, professor of international
relations at the University of Chi-
cago

He cited the failure of nations
to assert themselves when Japan
entered Manchuria in 1931 and
again when the Italians conquered
Ethiopia.

Dr. Laves pointed out that any
other country would probably
have done the same thing the Ger»
mans did in bringing back its sub-
lects to the homeland. Such tac-
tics, he stated, constitute a threat
to world peace.

He defined the League of Na-
tions as a twofold organization
set up, first, for peace, and, second-
ly, to protect the sovereign rights
of nations not directly involved in
disputes.

The World court is merely a
judicial organization, Laves stated.
