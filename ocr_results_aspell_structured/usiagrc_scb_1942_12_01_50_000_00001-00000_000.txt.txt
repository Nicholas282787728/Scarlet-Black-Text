TennisCourl'
Skaling Rink
Backed Again

Preps Sponsor Job;
Would Charge Ice Fee
To Solve Finances

Hopes for the long-discussed Grin-
nell skating rink appeared bright-
er than in many years when
James Gibbs, freshman class pre—
sident announced that class will
sponsor the project.

According to present plans, the
class will assume the responsibi-
lity of flooding and maintaining
the rink on the site of the men’s
north tennis courts, charging a
small admission fee to defray ex»
penses.

uAdministrative approval has
been secured for the project, the
problem now being to finance it,"
Gibbs said. Several plans for fi-
nancing the rink are now under
freshman consideration,

The preps may petition the wo-
men’s league board, the men's
council of house presidents, and
the student council for an advance
of the funds necessary for flood-
ing of the site. Repayment would
be made from funds collected as
admissions. Another proposed plan
is that of selling tickets in ad—
_vance.

The problem is further compli-
cated by the fact that there will
be a weather risk in the ﬂood»
ing operation, Gibbs said.

Mrs, Ray Ferguson, housekeep—

rIt will, however, be impossible to
accommodate that number of

Tsk, rTsk.’--Not Even a War Can Change
Study Lethargy, Profs Woefully Agree

By Lucia Carter

The war has done little to change
the study habits of the average
Grinnellian, faculty members
agreed in a survey made yesterday
by the Scarlet and Black. G in
hell students. the profcssors ge-
nerally agreed are doing neither
decidedly better nor decidedly
worse in classes this year than
they have in the past,

Business as Usual . . .

“Grinnell has experienced lleiv
thcr a general debacle nor a great
moral uplift," said Frederick L.
Baumaiin, associate professor of
history. “No one is unduly excit-
ed or unduly depressed, The same
old Grinnell spirit such as it is,
seems to prevail."

"Business as usual seems to be
the idea in studies and in general
attitude," said Henry S. Cunard,
chairman of the faculty.

Or is it spllsmodic . . ‘.

lOtllcr faculty members e -
pressed the opinion that studying
this year is done in spur-ts, with
people working harder than ever
for a while and then going
through a general letdown. Stu—
dents are uncertain, they said,
as to whether to lcarn while they
can or whether to study while
they can.

"Work this you is done by
spasms," agreed J. Forrest West,
professor of music, “The students
appear to be uncertain as to what
they Want,”

“Everyone does well port of
the Limo. then lets up,” said
Louise Sargent, assistant profes-
sor of botany.

Or is it just worse?

A few professors have noted
marked differences in students'
attitudes and their resulting work
this year. Said Stuart Gerry
Brown, associate professor of Eng-
lish. "The men are doing better

this year, and the women’s work
has fallcn off."

Grace Hunter, instructor in
English, said that classroom work
has been generally low this year.
“People have been finding it hard
to keep their attention on their
studies," she said.

The faculty generally agreed
that, allowing for individual dire
ferences, the average student is
still the average student.

“The war has not had a tre-
menduous effect in either direc~
Lion,” said John H. Burma, in.
structor in sociology. “What effect
there has been varies with the
individual.”

“No change in the students' at.
titude is apparent," stated Grant
,0. Cale, professor of physics.

“The general attitude is all
