Will Ask Council To
Call For Moratorium

by Curt Gorrell

The War. Nixon’s hard line has
provoked a new intensity in the anti,
war movement, and at Grlnnella
wide variety ot protest measures are
being drawn up. Although activities
are being geared toward establish»
ing continuing pressure upon the

‘ Nixon administration, the prime f0-
cus for current events tails upon
Thursday, May 4, the National Morar
torium Day.

Last evening, gathering at short
notice, a small meeting or students
and townspeople discussed a pro-
posal to be put before the Grinnell
City Council. Although, as or early
Friday morning, no iormai docu-
ment has been drawn up, the ins
tent of this proposal is that the
city council encourage support olthe
moratorium with a call for the ces»
sation of business from 12 noon to
1 pm. on May 4. This request
will be presented to the council
Monday.

Plans for a Moratorium Day vigil
at Grinnell’s Central Park werealso
discussed, but all arrangements re-
main tentative prior to consulta-
tion with Police Chief Bill Peters.

In order to promote more com»
munity involvement in anti-war ac-
tivities, there are several sug-
gestions also under consideration
regarding setting up tables in town
( with campus and community hosts)
to encourage the support of anti-war
legislators, to petition tor the
GravelsMondole Bill, or simply to
allow for a general expression of
antiswar Views.

In support of the national protest
movement, the American Friends
Service Committee is sponsoring a
bus enroute from Des Moines to
Washington. Departing this Monday,
it will truck demonstrators to ral-

lies scheduled lor May 3 and 4.
Estimated cost per person is $45,
but costs may be subsidized by
AFSC. If interested, cull SGA
(x443) ior information immediately.

In events closer to home, thour
sands of athletes and sports buffs
converging on Des Moines tor the
Drake Relays this weekend will be
greeted by leatletters at the gates.
Also on display will be an Indor
china Cullural Exhibit located on
Drake’s central campus.

On May 8 Grinnell is slotted for
an exhibit of its own. AFSC will
have on hand a slide show of the
“Automated Battlefield," which is
used in the Vietnam War

The college steering committee,
coordinating these and other anti-
war activities, hopes to move soon
into a room in Herrick Chapel.
They envision this new environ-
ment’s function as a headquarters,
a reading room stocked with lite-
rature pertaining to the war, and
as a gathering place for those con—
cerned about the war,

Gordon Mather, who has been an
Assistant Professor in the education
program here this year, will join the
education department at Dartmouth

next year. But he would have liked
to stay at Grinnell,

Mr. Mather was hired last August
to till a vacancy created in July,
after the man who had been hired
by the college asked to be released
from his contract {or personal rea-
sons. The college immediately began
a frantic search to find someone in
lime for the fall semester.

To Appoint Salaried
Recycling Coordinator

House presidents in Wednesday’s
Joint Board meeting voted unanl
mously to appomt a student coordi-
nator for next year's campus paper
recycling operation, The person ap-
pointed to the position would be in
charge oi organizing the weekly op-
eration under the lines LEAP has
developed the past two years. Next
year LEAP will no longer be altered
credit and will not be responsible
lor campus paper recycling.

A yearly salary of $600 would be
paid the coordinator, pending aps
proval by Dean Walker and Nicholas
Ryan, Dean oi Admissions and Stu»
dent Financial Aid. The proposal,
presented by present LEAP faculty
head Ken Christiansen, also re-
quires that two “runners” be ap-
pointed to head the collection pro-
cedures for North and South cam-
puses. These positions would be
filled on a volunteer basis.

Other volunteers will be used per-
iodically. Hall presidents will serve
an integral role in the procedure by
rounding up floor collectors and post
sorters weekly and keeping daily
tabs on the boxes and plastic bags
in their dorms.

The SGA will have to assume the
expenses of the program because
it does not now net a pront Cure
rently all funds received from the
sale or paper iS used to buy cakes
and cookies for post sorters, string
for bundling newspapers and tieing
cardboard and plastic bags. The
financing of the LEAP coordinator
would have to come from SGA funds,
Before this proposal can be enacted
it must receive the approval of Dean
Walker.

Barry Hull, Bob Huxtable, and Kay

Sophar, candidates for the all~col~
loge student EPC representative,
presented short position statements
to the Board as a preface to the
election next Thursday.

Huff, who said “I will run for
every ottice until I iinally get elecs
ted," noted that as a black student
he wants “to get my foot into SGA,
so we can begin to deal with people
on a legitimate basis.” Huff earlier
ran for SGA VicerPresident

Huxtable has particular complaints
about the lack of student input into
Executive Council decisions.
“There should be some system of
advanced warning," he said, “so
the students will know what will
come up in the Executive Council
and are meetings," He objects
to the recent independent project
guidelines “handed down” by the
Council alld notes that “we have
lost too many good prolessors bee
cause students just have no input.”

in her statement Kay Sophar noted
lhat although Grinnell seemed to be
getting more liberal for awhile “the
options are closing up again.” She
would like to see better representa—
tion for the independent majors and
the institution of such programs as

Women's Studies HI am not an
academic traditionalist. I would
like to see a really liberal educa-
tion instituted here.”

Karen Auerbach and Mary Jane
Wynn addressed the Board in sup
port of ISPIRG and announced o
possible pelltlonrsigning drive in
the near future Fifty percent of the
student body would have to Sign such
a petition or support helore Grinnell
could become a member of the
lSPIRG organization.

Mr. Mather Regrets Leaving

Chairman of the Teacher Education
Committee (TEC) Randall Magee
told the she that several people
were interviewed for the job
throughout August, but that the col~
lege was not sufficiently impressed
by any of the candidates interviewed
before Mr. Mather. Mr. Mather was
interviewed a week before school
started. Since only two members of
the Teacher Education Committee
were in Grinnell during the summer,
the main interviewing burden fell on
Mr. Magee and John Pntsch (Phys-
ical Education) a member otthe edu-
cation subcommittee Of the Execur
tive Council and a member of the
TEC.

The teacher education committee
receives a recommendation from the
education department and tllen pre-
pares its own recommendation tor
the Executive Council. This is the
only department which does not send
its recommendation directly to the
Executive Council.

Mr. Magee was “not overly ilTlr
pressed” by Mr, Mather, but it
was decided that he Should be given
a onersemester appointment with
the understanding that he would
probably stay for one year.

Mr Mather told the ShE that he
approached his teaching assignment
in “an unusual way". He deliber—
ately tried to be non-directive in
class, and during the first month
or so many students were dissatlss
fled with his approach, Mr. Magee
said that several students wont to
Dean Walker to Complain, About
midway through the semester the
TEC met with Mi“, Mather to dis-
cuss the matter, partly because
they had to decide whether to retire
him {or second semester. “We
made it clear to Mr. Mather that
it was not an interrogation," said
Mr Magee.

Magee said that he himself was
Convinced after the meeting thal
Mr, Mather’s approach was a sound
one and that there was no question
but what he was taking his i'csponr
sibilities as a teacher seriously,
Toward the end of the semester the
Teacher Education Committee
polled his students to find out whe-
ther they felt he should be given
another one-semester contract. A
large majority or the students fa-
vored keeping him, although there
were still some “who were vio-
lently opposed to me," Mather said.
Several students had changed their
minds during the semester, Eldonna

Sides, one oi the student members
of the TEC. was one of those who
complained about Mr Mather after
the first two weeks of first semester.
But shortly thereafter, she said the
ccurse began to fall into place “We
decided what we Wanted to do in the
course, we did it, and it was really
fine,"

Mr Magee said that a common
complaint of the sludents who still
disliked Mr. Mather’s methods com-
plaineil that the course was too much
like an independent and that it Should
have more structure.

But Mr, Mather believes that his
candidacy for recontractlng next
year was clouded from the outset
by several factors, including the
impressions left by the initial un-
lavorable response to his courses
and the impression Of the TEC that
they were expected to till the posis
tion with a woman or a black, in
accordance with the Affirmative ACA
tion Plan and Search Committee.
Mr. Mather said that near the end
of first semester he told Dean JO-
seph Wall lhal he definitely Wished
to be considered as a serious cans
(”date for the position, According to
Mr. Mather, Mr. Wall lolrl him that
there was probably not much chance,
since the college hoped to get a black
or a woman to fill the position.

EPC Urges
Department:
Keep Nasser

The student Educational Policy
Committee in the philosophy depart-
ment recommended this week that
Alan Nasser (Philosophy) be ottered
a two—year contract The contract
would not be terminal and would
come up tcr review next year. De-
partment Chairman John Worley
told the SlLB that the department
will respond through the “normal
channels”.

Wot‘ley also revealed that the dc-
partment and the EPC have recently
adopted a series of policy guide
lines for the consideration of per
sonnel matters.

Mr, Nasser has decided to sign
the one-year terminal contract
which was oliered him by the col,
lege,

The EPC recommendation iS based
on a poll of majors in the depart
ment which was recently completed,
EPC members interviewed the thirr
ty students they knew to be majors
at the time the interviews were
conducted.

They asked majors to respond to
the question, “Would you’recom—
mend lhat Mr. Nasser be given a
two year contract?" The results-
[5 strongly yes, 5 moderately yes,
4 no, 6 no opinion (these students
had not had a course from Mr.
Nasser)

Those majors who have had one or
more courses from Mr. Nasser were
also asked to rate each course. 24
students had taken a total of 40
courses; the responses follow: 17
excellent, 16 good, 3 tair, a poor,
1 disastrous,

The policy guidelines which Worley
outlined to the SL3 represent a sub
stantial change in procedure irom
what worley agreed to at the cam-
pus-wide meeting held two months
ago to discuss the Nasser case. At
that time Woriey said that he would
agree to take one vote or depart-
ment faculty members and student
EPC members, but under the new
guidelines the EPC and the depart»
ment will vote separately,

The policy statement was proposed
by the student EPC and was adopled
at their initiative, It received the
unanimous approval of the sec
members. V
The policy furlher stipulates that
the EPC will base its recommenda-
tion on a professor’s “contribution
to student education.” Department
faculty will evaluate such things as
his scholarship and his prolessionnl
contributions to lhe department and
to the college community,

Worley said it was important that
students realize that the procedures
will be different from What his own
past public statements might have
indicated

The last of the three I consider

It is my belief that the EPC, its,

will truly represent the students
who have elected them. If this means
sacrificing the representative’s
principles, then they should be sac-
