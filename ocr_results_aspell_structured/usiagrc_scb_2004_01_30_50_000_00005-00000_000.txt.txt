A forgettable remake, and a forgetful Finn

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (R)

Bmdley: August 13, 1973, o dsy which will, nm, keep
on getting retold. Five teeingeti, some eithem sttnetive
men, others attractive women, travel into 'rtnvis County,
Texas and meet up with Leatherfaee, and wouldn’t you
know it, n masseere breslo out.

Kay: Finally we get to see a movie for a little nostalgic
pnng. The rotor Clrniritrrio Mass/tn: reelly ndtb credit [0
the legendary 1974 version byTobe Hooper. Now, we must
pay homage to this Hoopetion protocol, something so Idl-
omatie and capturing that this epitome ofcmarlvityewllh-

Jones chéc zellweger, all ofwliicli proved to be a stntegie
mismkc. TCM ’03 has a beautiful way of revolutionizing
the ﬁlmmnking philosophy and teehnique. Introducing
bikinirrisc jenns and Chic/em Sbiipﬁmhesbiils ending into
the early ’70, it boasts a elenng timerlmnscendcnr ioree at
work.

Politically-minded people also notiee the movies symr
pithy for feminists. Against the beekdtop ofstenehy male
eorpses dsngling on sliughterhouse hooks, it sets up i fer
male superman, I mean, super-person (Jessica Biel) as im
rnorrel, having miraeiilously escaped, writ, fought biek
Denth’s seythe with only a kitchen knife and, in time of
supreme distress, a pair of legs, Plcnse, don't take that wet
trshirt clinging precariously to Biel‘s here with two t's body
as women objectiﬁcanonishe is the only one who dresses
like that all through the movie and only her rate is spirotl.
So an we oil] it girl power? Man, and her running is :lwc-
some, whieh makes good excuse: for blocking out scnsi»
biliry when she simply goes from renlly dangerous corners

straight to really, really dengerous imposses.

The Man Withaut a Past (PG-13)

B: Ah, a phenomenal ﬁlm from the ﬁne ﬁelds ofFinr
land. Here's .l ﬁlil Fact about Fli‘liﬂlld: the Swedish word
for Finn (a person from Finland) is also the Swedish word
for pimple. But l won't let any inter-scandnnavien bicker
ing get in the way ofmy praise for this great movie. And by
greet movie, I mean great movie preview, because that’s all
l've ever been able to see. still, it's not often that a preview
makes me lniigh, like, n sustained belly laugh, not a cheap,
“Hey look, Ben stilletrust shot i little girl's pony" laugh, as
seen in the preview for the new end unnecessary Sinn/ey

Back to the ﬁlm at hand, The Man Wit/ma R Paul is
about M, i min with amnesia. He hangs around Helsinki.
the only neruel town in Finland, trying to figure out who
he is,

K: And he rintls love, whieh is very sweetl There are no
dislrthmwlng, [enrrsheddlng seenes here, but the careful
wey Aki Knurlsmnkj rilmetl them sends n powerful and
moving message to viewers. it's nil about love, but this is a
different shade of love, a passionate and reviViiying love
disguised in the lerthergy ind wmtiness of middle—nged
people, Witching this movie is like tilting e deep and eer—

gishnes and 3mm everything anew.

B; Oieourse, Finlnnd's other principal export, vodkﬂr
is probably responsible for your sluggishness. But I hope

your hangover tvon’t rinks the subtitles toe blurry to enioy
this devilishly droll dmmedy.
