Full Employmenf In 23
‘Year Boom: 2—6 Monlh
Reorganizaiion lnl'erim

Presenting the problems of res

conversion, Dean Earl D. strong
said Tuesday evening that the
accumulated deficit of civi an
goods and a vast reservoir of pin-
chasing power, built up during the
war, should provide full employ
ment in a two-or-threeryear boom
period immediately following v-
day, although a two-to-sixemonth
interim of reorganization and tem
porary unemployment can be ex-
pected. In a tail: to the postwar
seminar in Haiiies parlor, he said
that the real problem of econom-
ic reconstruction will be present-
ed in five or ten years when these
temporary demands have been

met.

Al. present 17,000,000 more per
sons are in productive activity
than during any peacetime perie
od, Mr, Strong said, adding that
this total is not so staggering as
it appears, because 2,000,000 dis-
charged service men will go into
vocational training or college, and
several million women will un—
doubtedly leave industry. Unless
unemployment greatly decreases
purchasing power, he saw no rea-
son \Vhy production must he low—
ered to pre-war levels.

The policies of the government
in dealing with problems, compro-
mises, and experiments will be
formulated largely by public opin-
ion, Mr. strong said.

Flies
- - In My Pies

"I don't mind them crawling
around on my dessert — it isn't
too bad when they fall into my
milk 7 but when they make love
in my cereal, I give up!"

An army of flies, the creatures
which offended this junior's sense
of decency, have launched a gen.
eral drive against all sectors of
the college. It is reported that
in a concerted airborne attack
they drove students and professor
from a religion class. Those
which turn up in the food are un-
doubtedly members of the fifth
column.

While resistance has been at-
tempted, the flies are reportedly
gaining on all fronts.
of the Grinnell staff in charge of
counter attack and counter espi»
onage said yesterday that only a
frost could wipe out this aerial
menace.

Jobs For All

“There can be — there must be — jobs and

opportunity for all, without discrimnation on

account of race, creed, color or national origin.

There must he jobs in industry, in agriculture, in

mines, in stores, in offices, at a high level of

wages and salaries.

There must be opportunity

and incentive for men and women to go into busi-

ness for themselves."

Thomas E. Dewey
