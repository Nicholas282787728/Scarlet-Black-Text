In it for the funny: losing the battle against yourself

It trims out in. a tough act to follow.

Two weeks ago thote a column on the joys ofbowling and
my appreciation of the sport. 1 was rather proud of that cole
umn, as I felt it made an important point and contained a good
number of funny jokes. With the help of my intrepid editors,
the column turned out rather well, and, if] may say, it really tied
the seals tpgethcr.

I’ve received a lot of positive feedback from students. from
colleagues, from friends and from Colleen, who operates the
Ladora Bank Bistro and makes the finest Stromboli west of the
Mississippi. I appreciate knowing that people are reading and
enjoying what I've written.

To all ofyou who told me how much you liked the column,
I thank you And I want you to knowiyou've really screwed
me this time.

I’m feeling the pressure to write another column as funny
as the last one, but I'm not sure I can do it. What topic will
resonate as much as bowling? About what other subject can
I muster such personal passion and harness my temperament
tal wit? Upon what theme can 1 so eloquently and hilariously
opine? thave a feeling my thoughts on foosball just won’t cut it.

Maybe I used up all of my best jokes in the last column. As
I've tried to explain, I’m not a quip machine. Unfortunately, my
editors don't believe me.

How many column inches have I ﬁlled up to far?

This is d1c phenomenon ofthe sophomore slump, the diffr
culty that faces those who put out a great album. book or movie
to duplicate its success. Now I know what the makers of “Teen
Wolf Too" felt like.

success is always a doubleeedged sword. on the one hand,
it can be an inspiring and Conﬁdencﬁbuilding spur to further
action. On the other hand, it can create a sense of pressure that
results in a paralyzing [eat of failure.

I'm an the other hand.

But I suspect I'm not alone, particularly at Grinnell, where
the pressure for students to excel can be rather intense. Great
things are expected of you by virtue of your merely being here,

and each success—m the classroom, in athletic competition. in
social servichseems to generate more and greater expectae

We attribute most of those expectations and much of that
pressure to outside sources, but its really a projection of our

They’re there to help you carry your bags.

Sometimes you write a good column, sometimes you write a
great column that has people clamoring for your next one. And
sometimcs you worry so much about following that great my,

The truth is this—while for
the individual, success leads to

personal sense of expectation,
for most ofthe people who share in your achievements, success
breeds hope, and that is a very different thing,

speaking as a professor, when a student turns in an “A" pa

but I don’t see it as a doeor~die situation for that student. Ifthe
next paper doesn’t reach the “A" level, I don‘t lose faith in that
student or feel like the student has let me down. It becomes
a teaching opportunity for me and a learning opportunity for
that student. It's what we’re here for.

Dealing with success is a matter of putting things in pets
spective. we tend to view our accomplishments in terms of
peaks, believing that any single success sets us atop a precipi-
tous summit from which we can only fall. We worry that fall
will hurt—particularly because we think that we will never
reach such heights againr

erience and distance teaches us, however, that what we
believe to be our peaks at any given time are really only single
points on a much larger journey. What really matters is not the
joyous time spent at the top or those abysmal points when we
feel we’re at the bottom~what matters is the climb. And the
great thing is that all those people who you might think are
watching and judging your performance in this process are user

and there's no pleasing
everybody. lfyou like this one, that’s great. If you don’t like it,
please lie to me and tell me that you do because we’re dealing
with a very fragile ego here.

I've got to write more columns and accept that some bets
ter than others (and most, hopefully, better than this.) I've got
exams to grade, reading to do, classes to teach. I've got two
research articles to ﬁnish writing, and a book manuscript to
tackle after that. I’ve got to stop losing and startwinning games
of Scrabble on Facehook.

All the while,I imagine the voices ofthosewho expect great
things, voices that I imagine as belonging to everyone around
me when really I know that they’re all just versions of my own.
These voices expect and encourage, criticize and cheer. They
tell me to be funnier, smarter, wittier, more serious,less serious.
They tell me to write this and don’t write that and you should
write what people want to hear and you should just write what
you want to write,

And out of all those different voices, there is just one that
really matters. It’s the voice of John Goodman as Walter Sobs
chack, and he‘s telling me exactly what I need to hear:

F“k it, Dude. Let’s go bowling.
