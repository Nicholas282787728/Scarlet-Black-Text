011 English Peoples

"The English speaking peoples Dos»
sess a curious combination of courage
and caution," said Prof. C. F. lavell in
Chapel Tuesday. He then proceeded
to noint out the fact that other races
have been more daringly enterprising
both as explorers and as successfull
investigators. "But," he continued.
“other races have been more Conserva-
tlye, more tenacious of the established
order, than the English race." He Ex-
pressed his belle! that to a. great ex-
tent we can, as individuals, determine
our Own destinies and that the move-
ment at the English-speaking psonles
will go forward only as the veriﬁes of
Christianity are understood and pru-
ticed.

Try New Method

'A new system of debate will he
tried out at this time in that it will
he of the open forum nature after a
decision has been given by the judges
who will be Attorney neonard Racker
of Waverly, 1a., H. C. hacker, debate
coach at the state university, and
Prof. M. L. Mott, of the English de-
partment of the same school. Herlzr
toicre, the open forum debate has been
used without the decision, but there
seems to be the interest lacking that
is found in the debates where a decis-
ion is given. 1t is agreed by nearly
everyone interested in debate that the
open forum is a good thing as the
audience has a chance to ask any
questions to clear a matter up and ev-
erybody who attends gets a better View
oi the subject.
