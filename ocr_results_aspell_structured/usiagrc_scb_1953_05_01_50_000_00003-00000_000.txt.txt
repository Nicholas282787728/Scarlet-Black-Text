A Long Way from Home, Joyi
Finds Good Academic Sysiem‘

by Carol Lawson

A long way from home; es-
pecially if you call home St.
Thomas in the Virgin islands.
Thus Joy Schultenbrandt, Read
sophomore, will tell you. Her
present home is in New York
City, but. she was born in St.
Thomas, a city located in the
Virgin islands on the Atlantic
side) of the Caribbean sea.

Joy is accustomed to traveling,
however, as may be seen when
one considers the many places
she has visited including several
countries outside of the United
States. She spent some time in
Ham,- Ciudad Trihiulio, Cuba,-
and Florida and at one time
made her home in Puerto Rico. .

she came to Grinnell at the
beginning of the second semes-
ter as an exchange student from
Hampton institute, a liberal arts
college in Hampton, Va.

“At lirst 1 had never heard,
ot Grinnell," she said. But
alter meeting Cathy Hampton,
James junior who was Grin.
nell‘s exchange student to
Hampton in 1952, she learned
a great deal about it. so
much, in (act, that she decided
to come to Grinnell this sem-
ester.

“I wanted to attend Grinnell,"
she commented. “because 1 ielt
that this opportunity would lend
itsclt to a broader understanding
of human relationships, Through
this exchange program, 1 would
be able to give to the students
at Grinnell a truthtul picture of

Honor 6 Presents
Theophilus Trophy

A new tradition will be start-
ed next Thursday at the second
annual Men‘s.Honar G banquet
in Cowles dining room. The
Dave Theophilus M e m o r is It
trophy will be awarded far the
first time to a senior man in
Honor G. Recipient or the
award, which is to be given an-
nually, will be picked by the
coaching staff.

Honor G members and their
dates will eat in Cowles at
6:45 pm. Tentative speaker tor,
the banquet is A. L. Frisbie,
editor of the Grinnell Herald-
Register and former- Grinnell
athlete.

‘ Guests or Honor G will be
members oi the coaching staff
and their wives, Mr. and Mrs.
John Truesdale, Mr. and Mrs.
Kenyon Knopf, Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Charlton, and Mr. and

 

Mrs. Ralph Mattingby,

Hampton, its students and their
attitudes, problems, and read
tlons. And then in turn C'ontrlbr
ute my impressions oi Grinnell
and its students to the Hampton
body. I truly reel that this is
at least an attempt to promote
understanding based, not on op-
inion and stereotype, but on
knowledge—and respect 0! indi-
vidual worth."

A psychology major, Joy had
attended Hampton for a year
and a half betorc coming to
Grinnell. Whenasked why she
chose psychology as her major
field, her reply was, “Every ac-
quaintance, interesting or other-
wise is a new experience. I
love working with people, talk.
ing with them and listening. My
great desire is not only to un»
derstand the 'why of behavior,’
but to tind out ‘what can be
done about it and then do its"

Her future plans include grad-
uatc school at Columbia univer-
sity or the University of Vienna
followed by work in the field
of social psychiatrics. Recently
Joy received an invitation to
spend her junior year (if study
at Pembroke or Brown Univerr
sity in Providence, RI. She
would be sent to Pembroke
under a special program by the
Hampton Institute to concen—
trate in American Civilization.

Here at Grinnell, Joy has
proved herselt to be an active
girl, interested in campus ac-
tivities. At Hampton she was
co-chairman oi the Cosmopoli—
tan club and a member of the
tutorial stall, the philosophy
seminar group, and the Hamp—
ton Script stalt, her college
newspaper.

With a characteristic winning
smile, Jay commented on Grin~
Hell. “I like Grinnell, it is an
interesting school with interest-
ing people and activities. The
academic system is on a high
level and it lends itself advan-
tageously to any student with
serious scholastic intentions. It
seems to me that studying here
is motivated by intrinsic desire
more than by extrinsic compulr
sion. And i might add," she
grinned, “that it‘s contagious."
