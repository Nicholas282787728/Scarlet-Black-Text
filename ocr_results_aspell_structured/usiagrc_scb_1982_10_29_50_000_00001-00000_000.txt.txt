schools such as Grinnell is that a large

lower tuition rate for Iowa residents.

New Federalism program is good. He ex-

8A8 G attempts to secure
compromise with trustees

The South Airican Support Group is
seeking action by the Board oi Trustees on
the compromise on college investment in
companies which do business in South
Africa which it presented to the board at
its meeting here last spring

SASG members Karin Peterson. Matt
Smith and Lisa Beth Kaplan met Monday,
Oct. 18, with John Price, c irman ol the
trustees' investor Responsi lity Commit
tee. The committee of four has been
reviewing the compromise in order to pre-
sent a recommendation regarding the pro-
posal to the entire board. The trustees plan
to discuss the proposal in their morning
meeting Grinnell on Friday, Nov. 5.

Five SASG members Will breakfast with
the investor Responsibility Committee
before the meeting for further discussion
of the compromise. Later, they will all
meet again ior lunch to review the
trustees' decision on the proposal

At 4:30 that atternoon, SASG will hold a
"nonrdemonstration gathering" in iront oi
the Forum, said group member Jim
Hunter, to announce the trustees' decision

' to the campus, Hunter explained that none

demonstration means the gathering will be
“non-conli‘ontational" with the trustees.
Joel Robbins, another SASG member. said
the nonsdemonstration will still be “a show
at support (or the (South Airman) cause "

The SASG compromise proposal in-
cludes the iolloiving points: that the Board
oi Trustees initiate stockholder resolutions
in those corporations in which the college
owns stock and which operate in South
Atrica asking that the corporations sign
the Sullivan Code, comply with the
Sullivan Code, and that they cease ac
tivities which contribute to upholding
apartheid, SASG also asks that the board
supply a written statement explaining its
decision on these proposals

The compromise also requested that the
board include a student as a voting
member or the investor Responsibility
Committee, but the committee has reiuscd
that request on the grounds that it would
set a dangerous precedent. according to
Robbins, However, ii the compromise is
accepted Pricr has agreed to keep in
regular contact with a student represen~
tative about the committee activities

ment should provide money ior highway
maintenance, Medicaid, weliare, national
