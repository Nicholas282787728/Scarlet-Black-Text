Taylor Most Versatile

Besides Taylor, whom he designated
as the most versatile Grinnell track
star, Duke montioncd Paulu, in the
sprints, and Pilbrow, in the distance
runs, as greatest of tho Grinnell run.
hers. Paulu is also the selection of
H. .7. “Doc” Huff, present Missouri
coach and former Grinnell mentor and
track star, as the greatest of Pioneer
sprimrs. ‘5Doc", in mm, was called
at the height of his career the Instest
amateur runner in the world.

Coach Duke stated yesterday that
at least three Grinnell records may be
erased from the books by this year's
rionoars. The mile relay team is,
in Dukes estimation, the best Grinnell
has ever had, and he has hopes that it
may lower the local mark before the
year is up. In the pole vault Parzybok
missed the Griz-mall record by only
three inches last Saturday and is al—
most certain to raise it during the
course of the season. Knapheidc may
establish a ncw high jump record, too,
Duke stated.

Witller Proposes Fraternal
Order in Vespers Address

A new fraternal organization was
proposed by Milton Wittlcr, assistant
professor of education, in his Vesper
address Sunday.

Called the “Order of Simian” after
the biblical character by that name,
the speaker patterned the proposed
organization after the virtues of this
man.

The spirit of Simion was the spirit
of youth, and Mr. Wittler suggested
that youth band together under Sim.
ion’s name.

Although a man of penetran'ng judg.
menu, Simion had a gentle heart and
an open mind. Like him the members
should be tender of heart and quickly
moved at the sight of need, the speak.
er declared.

Secondly, they should be joyous, he
continued;—orgaruzcd for the happiness,
of youth. They should also be gsn.
erous; people have Iailed to learn,
the speaker continued, the real fun
of giving, Lastly they should be pray.
erful.

Mr. Wittler concluded with the as.
