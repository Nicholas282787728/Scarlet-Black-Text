Captain Is Greatest Point Win-
ner for Locals—Watt a
Close Second

Grinnell's Victory over Cornell two
weeks ago today closed the 1917 loot-
ball season with one of the best rec
ords in the history of any scarlet and
black eleven. Every victory was
earned by Grinnell by a one-sided
score, With the exception 01 the Iowa
game, which ended in a 10 to 0 vic-
tory for the locals.

Tile Iowa game stands out as the
feature of the season, because of the
fact that it was the first time in
twenty-four years that a scarlet and
black eleven had been able to con-
quer the old gold.

lllls ’l'ntnleti 263 Points

Out of the seven games on the local
schedule, the scarlet machine has to-
taled 268 points to its opponents’ 26,
a smaller number than Grinnell piled
up against any of the opposing teams
except Iowa and Drake. This record
averages a point for every 1.3 min-
utes of play. of the 268 points, 238
were scored by touchdowns. 27 by
goals from touchdowns, and 3 from

‘ drop kicks.

Augustine has been the greatest
point winner of the squad, the big
fullback having crossed the goal line
for eleven touchdowns, scoring 24
ﬁeld goals and one dropkick. Watt is
a close second, with eight touch-
downs to his credit, while McMurray
lCOlneS third with six. Fleck and Day
have each scored ﬁve touchdowns,
Gram. has gone across for three. and
Wassenaar and Ward have each
scored once.

Ioll'lt Victory Shows Clnss

It was not until after the St, Am-
hrose and Highland Park aggregar
tions had been taken into camp that
anyone realized what a strong cone
tender in state circles the Grinnell
eleven would become. After the viCr
tory at Iowa the championship cali-
bre of the team was clearly recog
nized, and from then until the end of
the season it was easy sailing for the
local squad.

The overwhelming defeat of Goo
put new life into the Grinnoll men,
and made up to a certain extent the
85 to 0 drubbing which the Cedar
Rapids team administered to Grinhell
three years ago.

Knox Score Uncxl‘ectetl

The 47 to 7 victory over Knox came
as a distinctive surprise, for, altho
Grinnell expected a victory at the ex-
pense of the Galesburg school, the
size of the score was beyond all ex,
Pectatlous.

At one time it was thought that the
scarlet team might linish the season
without being scored upon, hilt it fell
to the lot of Sarﬁ or Drake to cross
the scarlet goal line for the ﬁrst
time this year. Three other toucllr
downs were registered against the
Grinnell team, but only one was 59.
cured by str 'ght football, this being
the result of a, forward pass and long
run by Sanderson of Cornell.

WlLL ELEGTGAPTAIN LATEH

Owing to Unsettled Conditions,
Election Is Postponed

The customary election of the foot-
ball captain has been postponed this
year on account of the unsettled con-
ditions due to the war. Usually alter
the Cornell game the election takes
place immediately, but the concensus
or opinion was opposed to it at that
time.

Altlio no definite date of election
has been set, it is very probable that
it will occur about the beginning of
the ﬁrst semester.

NOTABLE INCREASE IN
NUMBER TAKING ZOOLOGY
Professor H. W, Norris reports a
notable increase in the number taking
beginning zoology. Elghty»foul' are
registered, as against ﬁfty-eight last
year. Most of the increase, however,
is due to the fact that the course is
now open to freshmen. There are
three sections and it has been neces-
sary to divide them for recitation pur-
pose .

 

Who’s Who In Grinnell Football—1917

the most successful years of (201107

squad this year as a new man, and
showed much development during the
season in the games he played. His
return to the squad will be welcomed
next year.

Ray lluliliuah, end, age 21, weight
160. “Bo" got his early training chas-

jael: rabbits over thc Nebraska
sand hills. At Grinnell he has been
out of the steadiest players on the
team, and has played sure games at
end for two seasons. A heavy sched-
ule caused him to sevcr diplomatic re-
lations with the squad after the
Drake game.

Herbert Dnuhenbcrgcr, tackle. “Big
Dauhy" is the intaut of the squad.
Only 19 years old, he is 6 feet 5 inch»‘

to make a mighty valuable man on
the team. This is his ﬁrst year.

Vincent Dlullwlllwrger, end. age 20.
weight 156. "Little Dauby” is one of
the standy—bys on the squad. Every
night he was out for practice. and in
the few games that he was given a
chance to play he showed up in good
style.

Jesse B. Day, halfback and quarter,
age 22, weight 150. Jesse has more
quarters of play to his credit this
year than any other man on the
squad. It was a delight to watch him
carry the ball on a line plunge, for
he always hit hard and low, going
completely under the tacklers and
ending his plunge with a slide head
foremost which always gained an ad-
ditional yard or two. His work on
defense in breaking up plays was
invaluable,

He is a wonder at running a football
team, picking the right play at the

thru. With Augustine as a partner,
watt either started or completed some
sensational forwa-d passes. At runv
