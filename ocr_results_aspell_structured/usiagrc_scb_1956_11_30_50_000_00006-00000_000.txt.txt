A proposal this week that
communication be better facili—
tated between the student govv
erning bodies resulted in an ani—
mated discussion. The proposal
entailed using the sets report-
ers as liaison between the c oi
HP and League Board. and the
Central committee. The c of
HP seemed quite taken with the
idea, but the League Board was
somewhat less enthusiastic.

student Auditor Juergcn Room
neau, in a recent interview,

stressed the importance of using
vouchers for all official purch-
ases both on campus and in the
local stores.

He pointed out that the sys-
tem eliminates confusion in
these transactions and limits
the buying power or a hall or

“Absence of help from the town is a big problem in
Grinnell social life,” said Social Coordinator Tom Rodhouse
after a coffee hour last Friday, “Are Yoll Satisfied with
Grinnell Social Life?”
“About all we can call upon for entertainment are the
theaters, l'oller rink, bowling alley 7 and the Rex," adding

the last with atsheEpish grin.

Bette Gouglt and Phil Nel—
son coechairmen of Grinncll's
wus drive, announced this
, figure as compared with last

year's profit of approximately
lszott. The contributions will go
l to aid Hungarian students.

1 Every item at the auction was
sold. President Howard Bow-
en’s formal dinner brought the
highest bid of the evening; it
sold for $62. Bette and Nelson
gave much of the credit for the
success of the auction to profes-
sional auctioneer D. Ward.
Contributions by many stu-
dent orgnnizations also boosted
the total. For example, League

Board was able to donate al—
most 590 through their sale of
late minutes. C or HP gave
350 dollars from their treas»
ury.

“We have written to faculty
members to tell them who
bought their dinners," Bette
said, ”but it is the student’s job
,to ,conlact them to arrange for
a suitable time."

What can be done to im-
prove the Grinnell social prov
gram in light of these physi—
cal restrictions? “The social
program has really improved
in the last tew years — there
have been many innovations.
What we need now are NEW
innovations."

The best question of the day
was “What to do about the
Dating Problem?" This ques-
tion was so good. in fact, that
it couldn’t. be answered,

These and other questions
were discussed, but not answer
ed: how to get more people to
date; what to do with stags
(it seemed to be the consensus
of the coffee hour crowd that
coed dating was not the answer
to this social problem. although
it may serve other purposes.
Typical comment: “There's noth—
ing worse than taking a girl out
and having to watch her cat");
where can stags meet to the
best advantage?

The biggest gripe seemed to
be Opel-ropen houses. Student
opinion may have been re-
flected by last weeks threaten»
ed offer of South Younker to
sell this semester's open—open
to the highest bidder.

The question was brought b,
lseveral times: “Is a half hour

lworth all this fuss and bother?”
A longer period following a
date dinner on a Sunday after
lnoon was one of the suggeSA
ltions. A committee made up of
Tom Rodhouse, Jim Wolf, Mary
Wetter-holm and Elbert Smith
(modern forcign languages) met
to consider the question, wish-
ing to liberalize the rules “to
a reasonable extent," Rodhouse
said.
