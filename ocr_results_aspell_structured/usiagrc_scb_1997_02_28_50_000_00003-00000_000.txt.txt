Are you feeling stressed out yet? Escaping Grinnell

The S 82. B examines the effects of and solutions to college stress The story of a trip out of town

BY NGOC LOI
Staff Writer

As we all know, stress can make
people, especially Grinnell students,
do weird things and act almost like
total lunatics in their quest for that
eVEFIlluSlVC state of being stress-
free. Some call it peace of mind.
while some just call it a night get-
ting drunk at the bat, However people
see this ideal, the reality of school
and lirereiated pressure is always
sitting like a rock in one’s brain.
whispering insidiously, “I’m going
to get you. I‘m going to get you " It
is no wonder the mental health cen-
ter gets dozens of visits from menr
tally distraught students each seme5r
ter.

Most students are too afraid to ad-
mit that they’re havtng problems,
though. Instead. they unhealthily let
stress invade their bodies and their
lives, sappmg them of mental, emo—
tional, and phySical identity. As
Geoff Bright ‘98 said, “Sometimes
when stress is really signiﬁcant itcan
occupy all of your attention so you
forget about things that really mate
ter, and when it’s gone it leaves you
feeling empty."

Stories about stress can get really

, scary. Maggie McKee ‘97 observed,
“This semester I have three labs a
week and so I’m in lab so much that
I hardly have the time to actually DO
any work for any of these classes.
This is awful!" Other than the ever»
present academic stress, it’s not un-
usual to become homesick—espe-
cially when you haven’t even been
home since August—or to get sick
of Grinnell‘s few rather weary divere
sions. And, of course, relationships
can get quite stressful.

The signs of the dangerous, and

sometimes rather pitiful, effects of -

uncontrolled stress are apparent ev-

ery day of the week. One anxious
student, who prcfcrrcd to rcinain
anonymous, Sitltl, "I get depressed
wlieli my work docsn't have the same
results as the amount of effort I pttt
into it. .I worry about my professor-5'
expectations." Another said, “I be»
come really impatient when I‘m one
der stress.” The Vile effects of stress
also become disturbingly apparent
when one wanders into a room
choked with dirty clothes, books. and
various other paraphernalia for sure

Rctiee Bibby ‘00 commented,
"[Strcss] makes my hair go gicy.”

Mttny students, unable to cope with
so , exhibit unhealthy signs of
nicnttil, cniotiontil mid physical
breakdown. This is usuttlly ti subconr
scltius cry for help. Ellen Wltltcr ‘00
said, “Sometimes [my friends] and I
get really hysterical when we study
for tcstsiwc laugh rt lot and don't
really get anything done." Morc ex»

vival, such as old food, As Terry
Lizarraga ‘00 observed, “The level
of cleanliness of my room reflects
my stress."

Stress causes prcitialurc aging, as

merits also cause bodies to wither.

night they stayed up drinking coffee
all night, only to find themselves in-
capable of either studying for finals
or getting any SlCEp. Stress is also the
likely culprit for criminal acts such
as skipping class, pulling the tire
alarm, and attempted burglary. On
occasion, some students refuse to
enter ilie real world again. unable to
leave the warm security of their bed
or perhaps the mindless euphoria of
sonic drugeinduced state.

Considering the negative effects of
stress and our intibility to ever escape
its clutch, how should we deal With
it? Sometimes stress crctttcs more
stress, as one student driven to on
cxtrcmc walled, “Why did I ever go
to Grinncll:7 Iwanna goliooooomc.”
This dark pit of depression often
iiiakcs the situation worse. Some of
its simply turn our minds away froin
the stress by reading, taking a walk,
or resting.

Comhmting deluding and insidious
stress, however, often requires inno-
vation and imagination. One student
claimed that Iicjumps into bed for
about 20 or 30 minutes, just absorb-
ing the bcd’s wonderful sense of
comfort and security, before he enr
lets the harsh academic world again
for another couple ofhours. Kristina
Prescott ‘00 realized that experienc-
ing'n world where college students
and their problems or preoccupations
aren't her only surroundings made
the world a happier place. She said,
“When I get stressed out I go for a
walk in the town so I can see old
people and little kids," Greg Ruttan
‘98 believed he has discovered the
answer to all his stress problems He
said, “Even though you’re under
stress, the important thing is to act
like you’re not under stress. Eventu-
ally you internalize this action so you
never really get stresscd out,”

These solutions sound interesting
and might be worth a try. Psycholo-
gists, philosophers, professors and
various others—all knowledgeable
people who have degrees or imporr
tance—tell us that we can manage
stress effectively. The answer lies
within ourselves. In recognizing
stress and targeting it, we might not
only learn the nature of stress and

, obliterate it from our lives, but we

might even team the meaning of life
in the process.

Recently, I thought to myself, ,

“Goodness, I certainly wish I had
more reading in my life, One English
seminar simply isn’tenough." Fortur
nately, I realized that the Grinnell
community is acutely aware of dileme
mas like mine, so they have come up
with a great solution: putting up
signs. According to the latest statiSr
tic, there are 47.3 signs per student
at Grinnell, a number that has been
steadily increasmg since the advent
of SGA presidential elections

Not that] am complaining. I think
it‘s gr'eat that there are signs up for
everything convocations.
Rosenfeld Symposium events. Har-
ris parties, campus publications, ra-
dio shows, art shows, and random
haters of SGA, In fact, if it weren't
for Xerox machines, Grinncll prob
ably wouldn’t exist. Okay. maybe it
would, but we would probably all be
sitting alone in our rooms, occasion-
ally crying plaintively, “But what is
there to DO here?”

At Grinnell, bulletin boards are a
state of mind: if there is an 8 by it
inch space on any wall, it is fair game.
In fact, it was not iiniil midway
through my freshman year that I dis-
covered that the wall along the south
campus loggia was actually made up
ofwindows. Not even bathroom stalls
are safe. I know that Ipersonally have
spent upwards of45 minutes in a stall
in order to read all 17 pages of the
joint board minutes, much to the dis-
may of my floonnates.

Even the dining halls are getting

involved in the sign-making fretizy.
Although few thought that the Brain
Trust at Dining Services could come
up with anything to match the dis
continued (but sorely missed) QC
Gazette, they have outdone them-
selves this time. Instead of actually
labeling foods, which might be logir
cat, they post asign lit the beginning
of the line with a list of the day's
offerings. This format offers amuse
ing diverSions for meat eaters. as
they watch vegetarians and vegans
try to determine which part contains
vegetable lasagna and wlitcli con-
tains beefnoodle casserole.

One of the most effective ways of
dealing with the stress and pressure
that Grinnell causes 'stiidents, most
people would agree, is to get out of
our small-town Iowa prison. Students
often take trips home, visit friends,
oi go to concerts and other events as
a way of relaxing and keeping in
touch with the real world. The [ole
lowing is a profile of a recent road
trip taken by yours truly . rcprcscnr
tative, this writer believes, of many
of the Stressdelieving adventures cm-
barked upon by Grinncll students,
Names have been changed to protect
the innocent...

2:30 pm, Friday: We are supposed
to leave for Madison, Wis, now, in
ordcrto make it there in time to drop
offthree people at various locations.
and for lay-Oh and the Pinball Wiz-
ard to arrive at the Jesus Lizard show
by 97ish. Needless to say, we are de-
layed by various last minute trans-

actions, and the sudden realization >

that none of us knows how to get to
Madison...

3: IS pm, Friday: We stop at the first
ofapproximately 12 gas stations we
will visit on our way to the
Cheesehead state. This writer notices
that the gas station is selling cpho
drine in the form of stay-awake tabr
lets for truck drivers. Only in Iowa, I
thought iwasn't ephedrine banned
several months ago? We make amen-
tal note to stop by this station on the
way home.

4:30 pm, Friday: Sampling the varie
ety that Iowa radio has to offer, as
lay-Oh’s tape player unfortuitously

broke a week prior to our trip, we.

come across a station playing a song
by that veritable I-Iarris legend, Real
McCoy. Enthused beyond belief at
being able to experience Harris away
from home, or perhaps just at being
away from home, Jay-Oh and the
Ultimate Pop-Queen hop out of the
car at the nearest rest stop and com-
mence to bump and grind away on
eaclt other. putting on quite an en
tertaining show for this writer and the
selection ofold men in cowboy boots
and women with poofy hair who re-
side at the stop.

5:00 pm, Friday: We are now in
Wisconsin, and the gas station count
is at around 7. , . ’

8:30 pm. Friday: We arrive in Madi-
son, in a daze of sorts. The first or-

der orbusiness is to getHippic Chick g

to her sorority friend’s apartment.
Although Madison is not an
unmanageably large city, and at least
one member of our party has spent
time here before, it takes us three gas
stations, one trip around the capitol
building, many frayed nerves and
approximately an hour to find the
fabled Statesider privatelyrowned
dorm.

9:45 pm, Friday: While t-lippie
Chick prepares for a night of frat
parties and laerh and the Pinball
Wizard enjoy the sweet strains and
lewd behaviors ofthe Jesus Lizard,
the Ultimate Pop-Queen and I head
for his friend's remarkably ugly
dorm, named. not coincidentally,
Ogg Hall. Ogg is not even short for
a longer officthl name, like Ogden.
It is a simple, barbaric, accurate state-
mentiogg There, I discover to my
delight that to compensate for lime
green cindcrblock walls anti rattling
windows, each room in Ogg gets free

cnble, including...gasp,..MTVlll‘l'

Wc taste once again the pleasures oi
Singlcd Out, Lovclinc,,,this is what
road trips are all about.

1|:00 pm, Friday: We leave Ogg for
a Taco Bell break. Taco Bell is in-
disputably the other tliitig that road
trips are all about. The Ultimate Pop-
Queen and I are able to fulfill our
loudest desires 7 the Star Wars toy
currently being distributed is the
Magic Darth Vader-Yoda Illusion
Cubcl l'l l We devour our bean burrito
kids meals...

l2:00 am. Saturday: We head back
to the Slalcsldcr to meet the

concertgocrs. and begin the bleary-
cycd journey to the Ultimate Pop»
Queen’s house in Evanslon,

3-30 am, Saturday: Arrival in the big
city. Immediate sleep,

2:00 pm, Saturday: The exhausted
road trippers begin to awake. Awake
mg proves to be a drawn out process
of eating, deciding what to do with
ourselves (so many possibilities, so
little timel), and rounding up the
Ultimate PoprQuecn’s friend,
Tekkno Ed.

500 pm, Saturday: Appropriately
arisen and refreshed, our party of ﬁve
(we have left Hippie Chick in Madir
son and gained our new compatriot,
Ed) decides tojourney to Osco, that
haven of suburban convenience. At
Osco we discover some in genius toys
called Sqeczie Fruits. These lifelike
malleable balls are not only conver
nient for the externalization ofstress,
but when squeezed, they even smell
like the fruit they imitatel We then
head to the Ultimate Pop-Queen’s
father's house for some free chow.
That’s what parents do best...

9:00 pm, Saturday: Now full and
happy, we set out for a short drive
around Evanston, and an excruciat-
ingly long trip on the train to
Belmont Street. Jaerh, a suburban

Kansas City kid, is somewhat dispro-
portionately excited about our ride

on the somewhat dingy CTA line.
“But we don’t even have a train in
Kansas City!!! ll"

10:00 pm, Saturday: We arrive at our
destination for the night. What an
evening! Led by our own prophet of
pinball, We discover an arcade with
two rather engaging games, Tenni-
nator 2 and Magic Pinball. While to
the casual reader, Magic Pinball
might sound like a drab and uncre-
ative incarnation, it provided us with
literally hours of fascinating enter-
tainment. There were so many things
to discover A the way the machine
voiced its pleasure whenever coins
were inserted, its endearingpdmo-
nitions to “focus your thoughts" and
“love the ball" (okay, perhaps that
was just our interpretation of what
the game said). There was much life
and excitement within our reach that
evening. We enjoyed browsing
around a seemingly limitless nume
her of head shops, took two Dunkin‘
Donuts breaks,..we savored the city
life until the early hours ofthe morn

ing.

l:30 ant, Sunday: Magic Pinball
having bankrupted us, we headed
home to the ‘burbs. We were still too
excited from our exhilarating
evening, and weren't able to sleep for
many hours, rehashing the highlights
and pitfalls ofour many games. That
is, all except for the Pinball Wizard,
ironically_enough, who was so sear
soned that by meditating on the deep
truths of the game, he was able to
lull himselfinto a gentle and satisfy—
ing sleep.

Sunrise, Sunday: We retire to bed.

Two hours after sunrise, Sunday: We
drag ourselves out of bed for the
long, depressingjourney home, and
bid a fond farewell to our sweet
Tekkno Ed.

[2:00 pm, Sunday: We stop outside
ofChicago for a ﬁnal taste of the di-
vinc fruits ofTaco Bell...then all de—
cide that Burger King sounds better.
Everyone eats meat except for me 7
yuck! ill!

3:30 pm, Sunday: Racing back to
Grinnclt in time to start our neglected
homework at 4:20, we find time to
stop by that first gas station that be»
gait our trip. The time seems to have
flown — could we really be within
KDIC signal radius once again?

4.20 pm, Sunday: We arrive back in
Grinncll, more fatigued than when
we left, but happy to have had the
chance to remind ourselves that there
is a world waiting beyond Grinnell.
Dreading the start of yet another
school week, we all decide...to take
a nap.
