McConnell discusses FOG at
open forum; attendance small

By Tom Pantea

An open forum was held Tuesday
night on a topic that is usually the
subject of great debate by the
college community—the food
servtce.

The attendance, however, may
have been an indicator mat the
extent of student action to rectify
problems sometimes does not
correspond to the extent of student
vocal complaints. Besides David
McConnell, manager of the food
service, Daniel Fossum, assistant
manager, and three members
from the food service committee,
there were, at most, nine other
students in attendance at any one
time during the meeting. Some of
the nine were food service
workers,

McCONNELL was quite sure
prised that so few showed up. He
stated that on the average, 10-15
per cent of the student body is
unhappy about the food service, a
percentage not reilected at
Tuesday’s meeting.

The few who did attend
presented McConnell with
legitimate complaints covering
such areas as steak night and junk
cereal. The changes in the number
of steak nights and the changing
days of steak night were explained
by McConnell. It was decided after
the favorable reaction to the bigger
and better quality steak served at
the Grinnell Relays last year, that
the same type of higher priced
steaks should be served on a
regular basis but only three times
a month to hold costs down. The
abandoning of Saturday night as
steak night was largely because
members of athletic teams missed
many Saturday dinners by being
off campus for away games.

SINCE THE policy change, there
has been a higher percentage of
students receiving steaks than in
the past. However, McConnell
emphasized that he is open to the
possibility of returning steak night
to at least one Saturday a month if
there is enough student desire for
it.

One student’s complaint cens
tered on the evening meal salad
bar. McConnell explained that the
upgrading this year of the lunch
salad bar with ten condiments for
salad making and its favorable
acceptance has convinced food
service to cutback on kitchen
salads at dinner and instead add
five Condiments to the table. This
change took place last night. A
comment about the plastic cover
over the table lead McConnell to
explain that state law required it.
However, he personally doubts
that it has much effectiveness.

ANOTHER student asked if the
new soft ice cream really was a
significant cost saver over the hard
ice Cream. McConnell said that in
the long run there will be a
signiﬁcant savings and that the
switch to soft ice cream was also
based on sanitary reasonsithe
college has no running water
basins ior dippers ta state
requirement) and hair sometimes
fell into the hard ice cream con-
tainers. He went on to explain that
since 40 per cent of the diners are
new this year there has been an
overwhelming acceptance of the

soft ice cream. The major come
plaints against it come from upper
Classmen who are used to the hard
ice cream. In the future, when
more equipment and know-how are
acquired, the soft ice cream
machines could provide a variety
of flavors. milk shakes, and
yogurt.

McConnell was asked how a
decision is made when there is a
conﬂict between nutritional value
and the wants of the students.
Generally, he said, it is done case
by case. For example, McConnell
feels that the total lack of
nutritional value in junk cereal
(11‘an Fruit Loops) and their
higher cost compared to such
cereals as Product 19 and Cheerios
make them unacceptable for
serving. But in the case of potato
chips, another food McConnell
believes lacks in nutritional value,

he has agreed to serve them in both
Cowles and Quad. He did so in
Cowles to provide filler food for the
athletes eating there and agreed to
do so in Quad to be fair.

THE FINAL area of discussion
centered on the condition of the
cafeteria facilities. McConnell
would eventually like to see one
central dining hall with separate
rooms that would seat, at the most,
150 people. The advantages of one
dining hall are basically financial.
For example, operating two $30,000
dish machines in each dining hall
or operating two large stack ovens
half-empty are inefficient uses of
money. It will, however, be five to
six years before any definite plans
are made for new dining facilities
because the college has a prior
committment to rejuvenate the
dorms.

College buys Cooper

Grinnell College revealed its purchase at the Cooper School
property on Sixth Avenue between East and Elm Streets, behind
Quadrangle din' g hall, last week. .

The property which includes the Cooper building built in loot). was
bought from Levy, Malone, and Co. of Des Moines. The purchase price
of the property was not disclosed.

nnell administrators have not yet announced specific plans for
utiliza 'on of the property, Dean Walker did say however, that
demol ion of the old school was a definite probability. According to

Walker the school is a nuisance as it stands.

Turner ponders future

tContinued irom pl 1)

"THE freedom (of independent
status) implies a responsibility.
The composition of boards of
trustees, the racial and financial
make-up of faculties and student
bodies, and the programs of these
should make evident at all times
that the public interest is being
well served," he said.

Turner's remarks were ocs
casioned by his belief that the
liberal arts college although it is
one of the “hardiest animals" in
the world, is faced with an in-
creasingly popular belief that the
type of education it offers is
anachronistic and inadequate to
meet today’s needs.

IN the 1960's, he observed.
liberal arts colleges were seen as
the homeof anadversary class of
intellectuals who fostered
disrespect for American society.
He went on to say that this belief
was replaced in the 1910's by the
more ”ominous" view that the
liberal arts colleges were in the
institutions that “produced the
architects of and unjust war and at
the same time. . .ﬂie protagonists
of a constitutional crisis."

Should liberal arts colleges fail
or change drastically in the future,
he said, it will be because of a
failure on their part to alleviate
these doubts.
