‘ Iowa in focus t

byJohn lll. Wylie 11

Almost every school district has
its taxpayers associationia group
of people who support reduced
taxes and increased emphasis on
the “Three R’s".

The Grinnelerewburg Come
munity School district is no exr
ception, Its taxpayers association
was founded about to years ago,
shortly after several small rural
districts were integrated with the
Grinnell schools to form today's
tworcounty system.

But it isn’t so common for the
head or the taxpayers association
to gain control of the school board.

Apparently, that’s what has
happened here Two weeks ago,
school board president Howard
Warner lost his seat to association
head Harold McCulloch

Last week, McCulloch was
elected board president by a 4 to 1
vote,

There has been some speculation
that the move was designed to
control McClllloch, but the new
board president said recently that
it won’t work that way.

The Jasper county iarmer is no
nc\vcomer to school ad
ministration, He has served on the
old Ncwburg school board, and was
its president in 1949.

McCulloch is upset because he
believes the district today ls
spending more and more money
while oilering poorer and poorer
curriculum

“Actually, we haven't opposed
good education in any way, We just
want more reasonable spending,”
McCulloch said

He said the dis ~ict apparently is
doing a poor job ot teaching
students to read, write, and per»
rorm simple arithmetical com-
putations

“We know [here’s a problem
There are so many graduating
students that can't even make
change in a store." he complained

While quality has fallen, Mc-
Culloch claimed, the school's
budget and stall has risen, despite
a recent decline in enrollmcnt.

”Taxes began riSIng the lirst
year the district was con»
solidatcd," he explained. "The
ﬁrst year budget was $760,000 for
_, Opupils,”

"Now, there Eire lower than 2.500
pupils, but the budget is
$3,000,000 ”

He said one person can't reverse
the trend towards higher budgets,
but he believes that “if I lead,
others will follow with more
conservative action."

McCulloch said his taxpayers'

group has opposed recent bond
proposals [or the G~N dIStrict
because they would have resulted
in “overbuilding at a time when
school population is dropping."

But he said some new buildings
apparently are needed. What
McCullOCh wants, he indicated, is
to have the school district run on a
more business like basis,

It will be interesting to see what
changes have come to the SN
district at this time next year,

The great Iowa massage parlor
controversy is still going strong.

it all started last year, when
several outcall massage establish-
ments began running highly
suggestive ads in two Des Moines
newspapers, The masseuses, it
was clear from the want ads, ole
lered more than just a back rub.

But aitei- several syndicated
columnists mentioned the llew
wave of sin in Iowa’s capital, the
natives began to complain.

And a poll released Monday by
the Des .‘lﬂilles Tribune showed
that 77 per cent or those surveyed
want the parlors regulated and oil
per cht want outcall massages
outlawed altogether.

Not surprisingly, the number ol
women wanting regulations im»
posed was almost twice as great as
the number of men.

TUES .

i sit blurry eyed, at 4'45 in the
morning, trying to picture the visit
of John Culver last Wednesday At
4:45 in the morning, Wednesday is
a long time ago. And then I
remember that now we have been
told we were right to have
suspected the worst about Chile,
that yes, in tact. the us. has
funded efforts to “destabilize" the
government of Saivador Allende,
and Congressman Culver started
by speaking oi this latest in the
long run of secret American in-
terventions. He called [or ”strong
congressional review and over
sight of covert CIA activities in
ioreign countries.“

Culver attacked the whole
concept or us, intervention in
other countries, but reserved his
harshest criticism for the secret
decision making by which the
“distabilization” policy was un
dertaken.

Having decided belore the ClA
operation that I was incapable of
doing justice to Culver without my
notes, I now have had my memory
refreshed.

l-‘ootl problem

A student asked Culver What his
views were on the world food
problem Culver spoke oi the
possibility oi mass starvation and
the political instability and
hostility which would result He
proposed a variety of measures to
avert this crisis. Among his
suggestions were i) all ins
ternational committment to
produce as much as possible: 2) a
massive transfer oi appropriate
technology to the third workd; 3)
development and production oi
more and better fertilizers, Wltll
particular cooperation irom the
oil-producing nations oi the world,

In a question related to this
issue, the congressman was asked
about his reaction to the Russian
grain deal

in response, he called for a
limitations on the allowable
amount or purchase, better
monitoring of grain supplies here
and on the USSR by the USDA, and
open dealing so that iarmers get to
share in the profits of the big
companies At the same time he
pointed out that coinmittincnts Io
allies and humanitarian
obligations to poor countries must
take priority

Culver counters attack

Culver replied to a question on
wage and price controls by
suggesting that they should be kept
around as an incentive for business
to voluntarily restrain their prices
and profits, He noted that at their
inception, wage and price controls
had been eltective, but had been
lilted too quickly because the Cost
of Living Council had mixed
feelings about the controls. He also
pointed out that the controls were
applied inequitably.

Culver proposed a mix or
remedies to the problem of in
ilation These included' 1) fiscal
restraint, particularly involving

cutbacks in dclense and military
ioreign aid. 2i a closing ot
loopholes, with relieibeing given to
lower income groups, ‘tl a chan-
neling oi credit to deressed area.
4) massive antitrust action: and
5) creation oi public service jobs to
reduce unemployment,

Culver discussed his views on
speciiic legislation which is or was
tieiore Congress. lie mentioned
lhat he had voted tor a measure
that would open up the highway
trust lund lor use for lunding mass
transit systems. He opposed a
rider prohibiting abortion
payments to the poor and he
lavored the consumer protection

bill and creation of a consumer
protection agency. He noted that
his opponent, David Stanley op
posed this last measure.
Corruption

Perhaps the most overwhelming
aspect of Culver’s speech was his
response to questions about
Stanley's charge of general
corruption in government and the
specific charge that he had
received out-ol-state contributions
irom special interest ps

Culver responded ‘with anger.
eloquence, and sincerity to this
point. He berated the audience ior
not being iiiiormed and suggested
that the only way to eliminate
corruption was to have an active
and inlormed citizenry He
suggested that a reading ol his
voting record and knowledge or his
work ior congressional reform
would eliminate any doubt about
his integrity. He called lor on end
to discussion of this sort and for a ‘
srart of discussion of real issues
He pleaded with the audience and
scolded them ior “copping out"
and not caring about the electoral
process. He mocked the
hypothetical student deiending
apathy by suggesting that by
inaction. the Student was cons

Despite the lact that his response
was an effective counter to
Stanley’s charges of moral decay

saying

lntriguingly, yesterday it was
revealed that Stanley has received
$30,000 donated to the Republicans
by big businessmen and others.
