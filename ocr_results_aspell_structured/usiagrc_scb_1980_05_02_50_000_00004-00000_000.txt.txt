FOG announces changes in cuisine, appearances

Every small change and detail in
Food of Grinnell (FOG) af-
fects most students in some way. Food
Service Director Dave McConnell says
students’s daily contact wiui the
cafeteria and their fickle mstes make
FOG a constantly changing part of
Grinnell.

With specific goals in mind, MCCOi‘r
nell has implemented changes which
lead the way to more changﬁ next
year. McConnell reduced refined
sugar intake by adding loads like
whole wheal chow mein noodles,
alfalfa sprouts, sugarless peanut but-
ter, corn kernels and water packed
fruits to the menu.

According to McConnell these foods
have met with mixed reactions. He
noted the whole wheat chow mein
noodles cannot keep up with demand
while sugarless peanut butter has
been described by some as “river

sludge.” Consumption of water packed
iruits has come gradually, although
they have been on the menu tor some
time.

“we are always looking for new
things to try," McConnell said. “Eight
to nine entrees enter the menu cycle
atter each break." In trying to meet
first semester's demand for more
hamburgers, italian burgers and pizza
burgers were added to the menu and
resulted in a protest over too many
hamburgers, he added. Hamburgers
are now served less frequently.

A coney special, the choice at many
different hot dogs in one, resulted in
long lines caused by the multitude oi
choices. McConnell concluded from
this experience that a variety of hot
dogs should be served, but not during
the same meal.

McConnell made many of the recent
food changes possible through large

iood co-ops. This year FOG began us-
ing the Blooming - Prairie Company
locatcd in lowa City. McConnell
recently discovered a spice cerop in
Fairfax and a cheese company in
Warren. Illinois. These co-ops supply
foods with less refined sugar and less
refining at a lower price. of the new
foods, students suggest 30 per cent.
food companies suggest 10 per cent,
and the FOG stafi suggests 60 per cent
McConnell estimates. FOG uses few
manufactured entrees and has the
Food Service Committee's approval
through taste tests when they are
used. McConnell plans to make food
tasting sessions a larger part of menu
change decisions.

The most recent tasting session was
held April 10. When asked about the
results of tasting session, McConnell
replied that homemade entrees were
preferred over manufacturer's env
trees. He also said that many other
good ideas came out of the food
tasting session, however exact action
on these ideas has not been planned.

Another area of large change is
equipment of the cafeterias.
Refrigerated salad bars are schedul-
ed ior installation mis summer which
McConnell says Should make the salad
bar more attractive and functional.
Cowla is receiving two new dish
machines and a new floor which will
cost approximately $100,000.

Atmosphere is another concern of
McConnell’s and changes have been
and will be made in a number of
ways. A new service ware set will be
purchased for Cowles and Quad. This
set, the first new set in ten years, will
cost FOG approximately $20,000. Mc-
Connell feels new service ware should
add some color and variety thus imr
proving the atmosphere of both
cafeterias. Other atmosphere changes
include cloth table cloths on special
occassions (not paper), and three
more private dining rooms in Cowles
besides the two added this year.

Projects tor iuture changes in food
service include energy etiicient meals
and student surveys. The last student
survey did not go well because table
tens explaning the survey were not
clear and FOG underestimated the
time needed to fill out the surveys.
McConnell expects student surveying
of overall meal choice will take place
in October. This survey will be plannv
ed and expained with the failures of
this year‘s survey in mind. McConnell
hopes studying of energy eiticient
meal preparation will create ideas of
what type of machinery such as ovens,
fryers and stoves to run at wllat time
of day and year. However, no specifics
have been worked out as this study is
just beginning.
