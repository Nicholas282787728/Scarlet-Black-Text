HIGHER LEARNING . 4 . n

Ill his new book, ”The Higher Learning ln_Anleric-d,
Robert M. Hutchins, president of the University of Chl-
cago, offers a new educational scheme designed to educate
the public toward a less mercenary View of life.

Hutchins advocates a four-year junior college to re-
place the last two years of high school and the first two
of college study. Upon» completion of this course, the
student would spend three years in a university, giving
no thought to vocations but only to “truth for its own
sake in the light of some principle of order." Finally,
the student would enter institutes of research of a pro-
fessional nature. ’

It is Hutchins’ argument that such a system would
do away with the confusion ill‘ the present educational
systemithe confusion which exists because high schools
can have no single standard of work when some of their
students are preparing for college and others are getting
ready to go immediately into businessithat confusion
which exists because most small colleges strive to be
universities by offering technical courses.

The new plan would make for more complete educas
tion of fewer people. Those who finished the course
would possess a pal ioulai‘ly high grade of skill iii the
art of living as well as making a living. _

Whether the above plan is practicable or not, such dis—
cussion brings to light the weaknesses inherent in the
American system of education. It is only by such 1115*
cussion brings to light the weakness inherent in the

honest effort to revise the present mode of SChOfliigg'
G . .

ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS

A sociology professor of Yenching university, China,
has become county magistrate ill on isolated country city.
Another professor of the same school has left the coni—
fort and culture of university life to demonstrate in the
little farming villages the principles of Christian rural
reconstruction which he has been advocating.

These professors are not out of touch with the people
and the actual coilditiolis of society. During a street
cleaning and repairing campaign the scholarly magistrate
himself could be seen, pick in hand, leading the citizens
in repair work. He has instituted much public health
and education work and tries ill every way to improve
the local conditions.

He Said, “There is 2.1] idea prevalent among the ill-
telligentsia that political jobs are dirty and corrupt, and
it is not for them to soil their hands by doing such work.
You cannot do away with dirty politics and undesirable
conditions by staying away from them; what we need is
for men of ability to enter into them and try to correct
them.”

. Let's do less idle blaming and get out and do some
thing to improve undesirable conditions —R. G.

now being held by the varsity
mermen on Tuesday and Thurs-
day afternoons. The squad has
been taking conditioning exercises
in the men's gymnasium for over
a week, and the intensive train-
ing period which begins imme-
diately following Thanksgiving
vacation will find the squad in
good condition, the coaches be-
ileve. at that time regular dally
practice sessions will begin.
Coaches Confident

~The coaches expressed confir
dance in the outlook for a suc-
ccssful season. “With such capa-
blc veterans as Melgard, Holch.
Burchard, Livermore, Hyre, and
Foster, and a likely looking group
of Sophomore and transfer pros-
pects including Voss, Harris,
Vance, Scidler, Conkling, Kolyn,
Ferguson, and Downcy from which
to draw, wc should be able to
present a better balanced team
than the varsity of last year

which placed third in the Mis-
souri Valley conference meet.”
said Co-capiain Howard Whitney.

The tentative schedule to date
includes plans for meets with
Carleton, St. Olaf, Gustavus Adol-
phus, Washburn, and Augustana
colleges, and Iowa, Nebraska, and
Washington of st. Louis universi-
res,

world safe for democracy” and “A
war to end war" were the slogans
which kept up enthusiasm.

The third question, "Why did
the boys come back?”, he an.
swered by describing the tide of
battle turned by their entry, and
Wilson’s Fourteen Points which
convinced the Central Powers that
they would have fair terms of
peace.

kcadjustmcnt

“What's happened to the boys
and the world since?" Dr. Becker
,told of the returned soldiers dif-
ficulty of adjusting themselvm to
a changed world, of their own
personalltles dislocated and warped
by their experiences. He described
their resentment at the number of
war millionaires and at tho defi-
ciencles of the League of Natlons,
the organization that was to have
made another war impossible.

War Debts

Disillusicnment has followed
the war throughout the world, the
Speaker declared. He told of the
difficulty of collecting the war
debt, of the treaty of vengeance
rather than of realism and justice
which closed it, of the failure of
the Dawes plan and the Young
plan.

The failure of the peace treaty
is the saddest part of the whole
thing, Dr, Becker declared. The
lmperiailstic and civil wars which
have followed it, and the prepara-
tions for another war are the
surest proof of that fact,

“Y" Cabinets to Hold
Banquet Thursday Night

A banquet for the cabinets of
the Young Men's Christian asso-
ciation and Young Women’s Chi-ls-
tian association will be held to
marrow evening at 5:15 at Carney
house. Miss Evelyn Gcrdncr, dean
of women, and Shelton L. Beatty,
dean of_men, will also be present.

“We want the two organizations
to get a bcttcr understanding of
cach other,” Berger Graves, in
charge of the banquet, said. At a
recent cablnet meeting of the
Young Men’s Christian associa-
tion the hcnquct was planned as
the first in what ls hoped to be a
semi-annual affair, so that the
two organizations can exchange
ideas.

Browne Bel-r ls in charge of the
program which will follow the
banquet.

DORIC

Oh, Boy, Oh, Boy, this should be
a good Doric, wlth the editor out
of town and no restrictions. Here
ls a good chance to get real dirty.

r r e
Tim FACULTit MIND:

“The chances nro 0-10 that

you will end up in the guitar

or the insane hospital if you
continually employ alcohol or
dope its a. compensation."—

S'roors: Well I guess I’ll try

it. 9-10 is safer than driving

an automobile.

In the mail a certain young
man got a list of new books in
the Libc together with a notice
that no more books might be
withdrawn until his fine was paid.
(Note: 1 was 'he.)

s s a
in the weekly circular sent
to on seniors begging them
to check their vocational de-

. rcs I ran across the follows

mg sentence, “In what gen-

eral field or builless are you
interested in?" Of whom
was you thinking when you
was writing that, Mr. Boer»
man?

s s s

Caput Angulare de Quadratus
Labi Supei-icris, formerly known
as Levator Labii Superioris Ala<
,guc Nasi is what Dwight Porter
broke in his nose. It's really the

bone in the nose.

Those cute little snootics
wearing the red hair ribbons
nro really freshmen girls.
While the men get more e1-
fcminite in their prepping ac-
tivities, the gills get more
masculine. Soon the girls
will be paddling each other,
null then Bentty and Gardner
will have to change places
for a while.

Robyn Dare, the high school
students idea of the way to act
at college, is going to get it, as
we used to say in grade school.
Albert Manny is keeping score of
Robyn’s blurtings in class and
will soon be able to confront
Robby with this data. Every
time Dare raises his hand it
counts one, every time he talks
without being Called on it counts
one-half. He scored 30 ln the
freshman economics class the
other day according to Manny,
but, Albert, you should just try
and keep track in our British
history some day.
