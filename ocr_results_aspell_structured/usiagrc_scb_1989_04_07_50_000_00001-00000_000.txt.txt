Grinnell adopts Des

by Jennifer Watson

This spring, Grinnell College
will adopt a ﬁfth-grade class from
inner—city Des Moines as part of
the national “1 Have A Dream"
program The college will set up
a foundation which guarantees
that any participating student who
graduates from high school will
receive tuition payments of up to
$1,709 per year at an accredited
college or vocational»training
school.

All money donated will be

A given in Grinnell College's

name, and individuals associated
with the college will work

, directly with the students as

sponsors and mentors. The ulti-

- mate goal of the Grinnell “I Have
‘ A Dream” project is to encourage

other groups and individuals to
sponsor classes while enjoying
the achievements of the founda-
tion.

The national “I Have A

g Dream" program was founded in

New York Cit_y by Eugene Lang,

a businessman, who was asked to
give a speech to graduating sixth
graders at an elementary school.
He decided to also give the
students an incentive to continue
their education, and devised the “I
Have A Dream” program. This
guaranteed that each of the sixth-
graders who graduated from high
school would receive the equiva»
lent of tuition to a state uni-
versityr Lang also hired a full-
time project coordinator to
monitor and motivate the students
and provide them with personal
support. Since then, “I Have A
Dream” branches have opened all
over the country. In Chicago, at
least five classes are currently
being sponsored, including one
sponsored by former Grinnell
parents.

Jim Tederman, former dean of
students, decided that Grinnell
was not doing enough for
disadvantaged youth, and came up
with the idea of starting an “I
Have A Dream" branch in Des

Moines. When Tcderman rc-
signed, Jim Work of the Office of
Summer Programs inherited the
project. Work will be the
executive director of the college’s
foundation.

The college has not yet
selected its project coordinator.
When Work visited the “I Have A
Dream" chapter in Dallas, Texas,
he said, he was told that ”the best
coordinators are frustrated
schoolteachers, people who are
frustrated with the bureaucracy.”
The project coordinator is a full4
time job and is the only paid
position in the foundation. The
coordinator should be someone
from a background similar to the
students who can also work with
their families and their school.
The project coordinator is an
advocate for the students and
keeps track of their attendance and
scholastic progress. He or she
arranges for tutoring. counseling,
and any other assistance the
students need. The coordinator is

also someone the schools can
work with if problems with
participating students arise.

In addition to the coordinator.
the “I Have A Dream” program
provides mentors who meet with
the students in groups of four or
five. The mentors take students
on field trips to museums,
concerts, amusement parks. and
other places in order to provide
positive role models and the
opportunity to make future
contacts.

The “I Have A Dream”
program was designed to give
students [he incentive to finish
high school. They may choose
the educational institution,
whether vocational or academic,
that they wrll attend. For many
inner-city students, working
toward future goals seems
pointless because they have no
hope for the realization of their
goals. The "I Have A Dream"
program provides that hope.
