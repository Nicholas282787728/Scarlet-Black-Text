”Galileo had to measure how fast some
thing was falling. He didn’t have an egg
timer so what did he do? He used his pulse,
But that did not work. He got all excited and
his pulse got faster.”

Grant 0. Gale, Professor Emeritus of
Physics, is a living legend at Grinnell.
Gale is the founder and curator of the
science museum and the brain behind
monyofthewonderﬁrlcreationsdisplayed
there. Heis also the founderofthefamous
32 program for engineering at Grirrnell.
The Grinnell observatory, which ranks

among one of the best of its kind in the
countryforacollegeofGrinnell’ssize,was
named after him.

More than anything else, ProfessorGale
is a teacher known for his dedication and
his outstanding rapport with students.
The physics department hasmanydistin-
guished alumni which include the late
Robert Noyce, winner of the Nobel Prize
and the Charles Draper Prize for his in-
vention of the silicon chip, and Mickey
Schulhoif, currently the President ofSony
America. Many alums regard Gale as
their mentor even now.

Hehas wontheuanostadmiration and
respect from all his students, majors and
non~majors alike, Gale takes pride in his
students and talks highly about their
achievements. Onhis achievements, how—

5&8: You have traveled all over the
world, Tell me about your travel experi-
ences.

GOG:WelIrhe ﬁrstonewasprobablythe
most interesting because I took the whole
family. I became the ﬁrst person to get a
Fulbrightin the College in 1954-55. This
wasalectureshipin
Baghdad, Iraq. At
that time Iraq was
very pro-Westemr
King Paisalwas still
on the throne, He
was only nineteen
years old then and
spoke ﬂuent En-
glish. We had an
audience with the
king, just the male
members though. The king invited only
the male members of the Fulbright pro-
gram, notthe female members! However,
it was quite interesting reception and we
enjoyed the hospitality very much. He
was full of praise for the Fulbright pro
gram.

S818: How long were you in Baghdad?

GOG: One academicyear. I taughtphys-
ics there. Almost all the sciences were
taught in English. They had English text-
books and the students understood En-
glish very well. They however had a little
trouble understanding my American En-
glish because mey were mostly accus-
tomed to British English. Other than that
we got along very well.

5&8: What was the funniest experience
you had abroad?

GOG: I had a great variety ofsuch expe-
riences (laughs). l was once stopped by
the police [in Baghdad] for a trafﬁc viola-
tion. He [the policeman] asked for the
driver‘s license and I pulled this thing out
ofmywallet. Ithad mypicture on it. Itwas
all printed in Urdu. I showed it to the
policeman. He turned it upside down,
looked at me and waved me on. when I
got to the university, I told my students
what happened that day and they burst
out laughing. It was actually a permit to
take photographs and not a driver’s 1i»
cence. However, the policeman did not
know what it was, and neither did I!

5&8: What are some of the other coun-
tries you visited?

“What concerned

me most was the

conﬂict between
the Hindus and the

Muslims which still
goes on.”

GOGiln1959-60,IgotanotherFulbright
to go to India. I taught at the Benaras
Hindu University (Bl—ill) for the summer.
It was a great experience. The students
were very interested in science and math-
ematics. Ivisited Calcutta too on my way
to Dhaka, Bangladesh, and then to
Kathmandu, Nepal. I also Visited Karachi
in Pakistan. What concerned me most
was the conflict
between the Hin»
dus and the Mus»
lims which still
goes on

I also went to
Ethiopia on an-
other Fulbright
program in 1969-
70.1reallyenjoyed
teachingthere.The
students were very
motivated and eagerto leam. I also toured
widely in Europe~in France, Spain, Italy
and the Scandinavian countries.

5&8: What motivared you to be a physicist?

GOG:WhenIgraduatedfromhighschool
in the early 1920’s, anyone who was
interested in electricity went into electri-
cal engineering. Hence my undergradu-
ate work was in electrical engineering. I
was mostlyinterested in electricity. I used
to make Crystal radios and electric motors
at home. My parents, who were both
collegeeducated, were very supportive of
my interest in physics and encouraged all
my creative endeavors.

5&3: Did on ever ima irre ourselfasa
Y 9 y

professor at that time? What brought

you to Grinrrell?

GOG: l was the youngest of seven chil-
dren in the family. Several of my elder
brothers and sisters went into teaching.
Also, there were many other teachers in
the family. Knox College was founded by
my relatives. Hence the name Galesburg.
Hence, teaching was always an option for
me. My ﬁrst job after college was in a
telephone company on the let floor of
the telephone building. I did not want to
spend the rest of my life on the let ﬂoor
and so I came_here.

5&8: You have been at Grinnell for the
pastsix decades. What’s so special about
Grinnell?

GOG: Grinnell is notwhatI call a ‘week»
