True Lies

We’ve found thatyou'll either
reallylikethismovicoryou’li think
it‘s crap. Arnold Sehwartzenegger
is a spy whose double life jeopar—
dizes both his farmly life and his
country. While Derek was unim-
pressed and says. “Hmplil Icould
flyaHarrierbetterthanlhall",Craig
thought the movie rocked and says
only, “Whom". We both agree that
it drags a little in the middle, but
also that Tom Arnold gives one of
his best performances. All in all, go
see it so you can make your own
decision

Bladerumier

A totally cool, sci-ii classic! in

Harrison Ford! Assigned to track
down and terminate a group of rise
caped replicants, Harrison faces his
toughest job ever as his feelings
begin to get in the way of his work.
A very dark movie, but completely
worth seeing.

Blown Away
This movie didn’t exactly blow
usaway. JeffBi-idges stars as abomb
squad expert whose past withanIi-ish
terrorist group comes back to haunt
him. Tommy Lee Jones plays the
psycho bomber out for revenge. This
ﬁlm is basically zi bunch of leWr
motion shots of Jeff running around
drying to stop explosions. Thismovie

The Jerk

Imagine Steve Martin saying at
the beginning ofamovie, “I was born
a poor black child." Now imagine
that same kind of humor for an hour
and ahalf. That’s WieJerk, The story
follows the life ofNavin R. Johnson.
possibly the stupidest person to ever
walk the earth, Lots of greatlines and
gags make this a comedy classic.
Plus, it helps you remember your
“special purpose" in life.
