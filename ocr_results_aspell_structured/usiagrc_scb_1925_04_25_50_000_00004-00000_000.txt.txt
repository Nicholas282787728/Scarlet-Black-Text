call.

Lester Duke, all—Valley football

in the home meet that he has plenty
of speed, at almost any distance.

Bulldog Relay Meet

(Continued from PIKE 1.)
Locke or Nebraska ran the century

in :10 ilrit to win his heat which was
the lastest or the day. Fisher at Kan»
sits and Wittinau oi Michigan each
copped their races with the slow time
or :10 1-5. El'eoliins won his special

0 yard low hurdles with the slow
time or :24 2710. However it is prob»
able that he was not pushed as Guild»
i-ie ot Ohio and Kinsey of illiuois are
not in his class as toppers of the low
sticks.

The high jumpers to quality at the
mark or six rest were mostly new men
to the Drake crowd. One or them was
Bates oi Simpson who had not been
expected to quality.

Grinnell high school made a good
showing by winning beats in both the
quarter mile and hall mile relays of
class B section. The time made by
the local high school runners was
comparatively fast,

The lone drawings for the finals
shows that Grinnell was iairly fort»
unate in the mile relay. She drew
third position and will run in the
same heat with Illinois. Notre Dame.
Wisconsin. Dartmouth and Iowa State.

Grinnoll, Friday morning, April 24.
iTlle Pioneer track team iourneyed
to Des Moines this morning where
they are competing in thc Relay Car-
llival this afternoon.

The team with the most likelihood
of winning a first. is the mile relay
‘tcaiii composed of Scliernwehcr. M.
Jones, Kitchen and Taylor. They set
a new meet record at the Kansas meet
last Saturday. They will undoubtedly
have much stiffer competition today,
but should Win.

Taylor, Scharnweher, L. Jones and
, Green are running the half mile relay.
They will have fast opposition in Illir
nois, Wisconsin, and Kansas. Texas
,was two-tenths of a second behind 11-
linois at the szhawk meet and may
step out fast enough to win this event.

King, Gould, Meyer and J. Stotts are
each running a half mile in the two
mile relay As this is the ﬁrst time
this team has been in action this year.
