Lessons left to learn

Students, faculty and administrators reﬂect on what the campus should learn from the allegations against SGA
President Paul Robeson Ford ‘02 and from the resignation and Hearing Board proceedings that followed

Staff Writer

Two weeks before the end oflnst school year, Pull Fold
'02 resigned as SGA president in reaction to student come
plaliits ofsexunl misconduct School ended before the rec
suits oFrhc cnsuingiudiciel proceedings had been decided,
leaving many questions For the umpus community: should
Ford have resigned? What would the Hearing board cle»
aide? Had SGA’s actions been legitimate?

Background

Allegations ﬁrst came to light in late Aptilv Brandon
Zichn ‘03, an SGA scnotor, became aware oftwo inclividu»
ais with possible complaints against
Ford, and as he said in :m irrrervrcw
last year, “helped bridge the gap"
between the two. The two lndlvldllc
nls alleged incidents oF sexual misc
conduct, one onhich allegedly
curred in Ford's SGA ofﬁce, F .
lowing these allegations, SGA Vice
President Gabe Rosenberg '03 called
a cabinet mooring on Friday, April
26 to suggest that the body ask Ford
to resign.

cabinet supported Rosenberg
almost unanimously, according to one unnamed source
lsrst year. The next morning at 11 rim, Rosenberg asked
Ford to meet with him and three other students icplcxent»
irrg SGA. the two complainants, and the college's Sexual
AssairltWorking Group. The group gave Ford the option
ofresigning by e p.m. the following day in order to avoid
hnvrng the issue brought before Joint Eonrd.

Ford resigned it! 559 on April 23 staring that ho had
no other choice. "[Not resigning] would have meant these
accusation would be publiciacd through loini Board, and
there would essentially have been a public trinl ofme, as
the sitting chair of Joint Board and beyond that being
incredibly awkward, it would have been incredibly messy
and ugly," Ford said last year.

Because oftight conﬁdentiality clauses laid out in til:

student handbook, the public still has little information _

about the speciﬁcs ofihe msc, including the outcome.
Ford, who visited campus at the beginning oFthc sc-
mesrcr, said he did not Feel unwelcome. “Those who know

Hearing Board

Ford's case was heard by the Hearing Board, the judi»
curl council rcscrvcd for the most serious cases. Unlike the
other three councils, cases in front of the Hearing Board
:er lionrd only by administrators.

Because of the Ford case, sovomi procedures within rhc
,udrcial process, as well as rho
makeup oFthe Hearing 801ml itself,
have been oucsironed by some stu.
dents and Funky on campus.

Tholihs the vice president For
diversity, pluincd that in the past
therc have b r sonic concern: about
having Faculty on the Hearing Bomd
because orihcir possible history and
experience with the studcnis by nor
ing strictly ndrrrinistrators, the board
contends rlml it can be more objcc»
tivc in dcciding discs because the ad»
mrnistrnrors chosen for rhc board do not Frequently inter.
act wirh srudenrs and campus life.

“We try to Find administrators who have had minimal
contact wich students," Thomns said. “Thar leaves a very
small group ofpenplc on campus."

The Hearing Board has been comprised orsdminis.
tmrors For only the her two years. Following the recom—
mendations oFa task Force made up ofvnrioirs ndmlnlstmr
tors, scvcul srrrdcnrs and brenr soknlow, an attorney who
works as a consultant to colleges on sexual misconduct law.

“it was out of the discussions over n two»yeilr period
that rho rccommcndnrron was made that it be an adminis»
tmrivc board," ion Krolm, Dean ofstudcnt Life said, who
had 521! on rho task force. She would not comment on any
possible limiraiiont afsucli A board

Sci/cull students now want to see faculty representat—
tion on the board, Zicha argued that the perspective rhnr
the administrators have of the student body is not com.
plete, “[Having only administrators] n a coral weakness,"

complainant

he sard, “it's one group with one perspective; they any
their own biases. They don't livc on this campus, and it
ignores the wealth ofesperrisc from faculty. There are
people on this campusiRLCS, student Affairs, [Health
center staffiwllmc jobs arc to maintain confidentiality.
Those people should he on rotating system."

some Faculty expressed similar concern that adminis-
trators do not have contact ivrrh rhe student body and are
thcrcForc less aware of the patterns or student behavior.
Victorir Brown, History, snrd that though studenrs may
have had vnlid muons For excluding Faculty members, they
may have failed to consider the problems inherent to that
decision. Now, she said, Gtinnell uses “administrative pets
sonnel who lack the independence oFtcnured Faculty, who
have no experience with student life, who have no ptofes»
sionnl [mining in questioning srrrdents, and who have no
background in making the hearing process educational."

Brown suggested that the college maintain a ”stable"
ofavtilablc Faculty, rind give students the option oFexclud
rng panic u professors From the Hearing Board.

Thomas, however, remains confident in the Hearing
Board's procedures, He said that they no chcctivc in work-
ing our conflicts between strrdcnrs. speciﬁcally, in the sire.
gations against Ford, Thomas found the process and pro.
cedure to be successful,

“The ciirrncll College system does work," he said.
“Someone tiled a complaint and it was Followed through
min."

Whllc administrators may have seen the procedure 3
efficient, one ofrhc complainants in Ford’s case Felt others
wise. “I felt interrogated by FrankThomns," she said. “He
asked me lots orquesrions, and pointed questions, 1 Fair
very critical questions... 1 felt that made it a hosrric envi—
tonmtnt,”

The cases outcomeralso concerned her. She said that
she was never informed ofrhc board's decision, despite the
student handbooks assurances that she should have been.
chuscshc never-received oFFrcial reside ofwhar happened,
all she knows she learned through rumor and inferences
from seeing Paul on campus this Fall,

When asked, administrators said that complainants
should have been informed within six days oFthe procud»
ings and that may couldn't speak of the specifics of the
case.
