This form of announcement is custom-
ary among the French Catholics, as is
also the two years OI monlnin”.

ed after a fashion, about four kilos
meters back of the German lines."

He told how the Germans helped him
out of his smashed machine, treating
him with the utmost courtesy, and how
Ger-man aviation oiticers from a near-
by ﬁeld came for hlm in an automo-
bile and returned with him to their
squadl on headquarters before sending
him to in hospital

“Aviators Have Soft Time.”

"My experiences may be typical or
they may not, or course I was an of—
nccr and an aviator, and they always
have the soft time of it,” Captain Hall
added.

He spoke a good word tor the,Bar
var-inns. "1 aslrcd one of them to drop
a note over our field,” he said, "to tell
them [that I was a prisoner, but sale.
One said he would, but I understand
that when coming back after dropping
this note he was shot down. There
were reports that he was a prisoner in
France, and when I got back I tried
to ﬁnd him; but I didn't know his
name, and was unable to do so.

"It was a one sight at times to look
out or are no pital and sec thc Amer-r
cans and French and lint tr coming
over and bombing the to“ . Our hos—
pital was not marked with a red cross.
however, and so all we could do was
hope that we weren’t hit."

German Officers Afraid.

"When the revolution began to
threaten alter the signing of the or»
misticc," said Captain Hall, “the Ger-
man oiiicers and men wanted to get
into civilian clothes for safety. The
commandant at our camp wanted us to
promise that we would stay in camp
even after he hzirl token oir the guards.
We answer-ed that as long as the
guards were there, we would stay, but
ii: they were lnlrcn oil, we would have
to use our own judgment.

"Our escape was easy. ‘1‘th didn’t
care whether we got away or not. The
war was all over. we iourneyed to
the Swiss horde occompanicd by an
old German soldier without a gun, and
were aided by a German oliiccr, who
told us how to get into Swi el'litntl.
When we got there, however, we were
arrested for agitators, and it took us
some time to prove our identity."

Captain Hail returned to his home at
Colfax this morning. “I want to get
the civilian clothes on," was his part-
ing remark.
