Task force looks at mental health

by Jess Ward

In conrunerion with several student members of the
Mental Health Task Force, the Mental Health Center co-
ordinated an information session last Thursday night in
part or a college— wide errort to increase dialogue about
emotional and mental hmlth on campus. The panel dis.
cussion, entitled, “Everything YouAiwayswanted to Know
About Mental Health But Didn’t Know Where to Ask,"
involved professors. counselors and psychiatrists in addie
tion to students,

The panel was intended as an information session for
studcnu with questions about their own mental health
needs as well as those of family and friends. Facilitator
Christine Rogers. a psychologist at the powethick County
Mental Health Center (PCMHC), began with questions
concerning the personal experiences ofpancl members and,
therapy services provided on other mmpuses. with almost
as many panel members as studenn attending, the conver—
sation turned into a dialogue about campus culture, studs
and general fears about therapy,

“1 thought the panel went well, despite the poor turn-
out." saitl Eileen Twohy '04, who attended the panel. “It is
always encouraging to witness students and faculty really
working to hear one anotherarid to tackle rough issues

\ a safe, constructive setting."

Discrrssion between panel and audience members was
frequent, brrr the topic or discussion Was not what the ir—
eilitators origimlly had in mind.

“Actually, the original idea was to talk about group
therapy a little bit, because we're going to try to get a group
running this spring," said Harriet DickeyCirasirrs ’82, also
a psychologist at the Poweshieir County Mental Health
Center.

Dicky Chasins plans to begin running group therapy
sessions soon this semester as a way ofcncournging sru.
dents to support each other, making therapy less intimie
dating for some.

In response to the suicides last spring, many on cam»
pus wanted to make mental health awareness a priority or
the college.

open forums, such as the panel, and increased access
to service. such as walk-in sessions with counselors at the
Health Center, come in direct response to heightened
awareness ortlreweiincss needs orcrinneil students through
the Mental Health Task Force.
