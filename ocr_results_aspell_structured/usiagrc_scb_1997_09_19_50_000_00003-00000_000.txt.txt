Gettin’ down and Dirty

PRESS RELEASE

The Dirty Dozen’s Mammoth
Records debut, Ears To The Wall.
once again finds the innovative band
stretching the boundaries of tradi-
tional music forms to ecstatic effect
on serious listeners and revelers
alike.

Originally known as The Dirty
Dozen Brass Band, the group
changed its name when its new in-
strumentation pushed it past the
boundaries of the basic brass band
format.

Renowned worldwide for revitalr
izing the once-dormant New Orleans
brass band tradition, the hand has
revamped its lineup to accommodate
a new musical vision. Adding a
keyboardist and replacing their two
drummers with a single trap kit
player, The Dirty Dozen gain a ver»
satility that will enable them to con-
tinue their innovative growth as mur
sicians while retaining the good—time
feel that has kept dance floors full
and audiences thrilled for nearly two
decades.

The band retains the basic format
that deﬁnes its sound 7 a sixrhorn
lineup with signature sousaphone 7
but now occasionally replaces the
sousaphone, both live and on record,
with an electric or acoustic bass.

The further addition of electric
keyboards allows The Diny Dozen
to color their sound in ways never
before possible while also retaining
their trademark mixture of musical
elements. These include traditional
New Orleans jazz, funk, RELE, and
pop. hearty ingredients that have
stood the test of time as part of the
group's smoldering musical gumbo
since its inception.

Ears To The Wall kicks off with
an instrumental that sets the tone for
the album and is true to its name,
“Funky Nuts." This track encapsu-
lates the feel ofthe new-look Dozen,
featuring a keyboard line that hov-
ers over a deep anchoring groove that
the guitar vamp keeps firmly to»

‘ gether.

The rest of the album contains ev»
erythtng from straighteup jazz to rap-
int'luenced vocals. Sousaphone acro-
batics propel The Dirty Dozen an—
them “My Feet Can’t Fail Me Now,"

which also appears in the film Sgt.
Bilko. And the blues gets turned on
its head in “Gettin' In The Cut," a
soul symphony of lnterweavmg horn
lines, explosive solo breaks, and a
funky back beat. The Dirty Dozen
showcase their lyrical side on “I Hold
The Key," a laid-back, hypnotic love
song of sorts, and the silky smooth
"Flow on." . ,
The‘group's musicaljoumeys, fu-
eled by theirongoing in-
ventiveness. have never we
been easy to chart. 5
The band was born
and bred in New Or-
leans in the late-1970's,
coming together when
there were only two
brass bands working in
town. Tradltionally, one
ofthe brass bands' funce

.tions was to lead a “see

ond line" of people af
ter a parade or funeral
procession.
The instant appeal of
The Dirty Dozen to a
wide range ofaudiences
quickly propelled the,
group from engage~_
ments at occasional parades, funerr
als and parties to international tourr

_ing, major-label recordings, and spe

cial appearances on national televir
sion programs including Late Night
with David Letterman, The Tonight
Show, and Austin City Limits,

Their ﬁrst performance at the New
Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival
came in 1979, and they have become
a staple for the festival, appearing at
nearly every one for the past 17
years. But The Diny Dozen have also
developed worldwide recognition as
ambassadors of their unique New
Orleans—based sound. having per-
formed in over 30 countries on ﬁve
Continents, including Japan, Brazil,
Israel, [7 different European nations,
and throughout Asia,

The Dirty Dozen‘s past releases
have received critical praise include
ing a “JazzAlbum oftheYear" award
from the College Music Journal,
four- and ﬁverstar reviews from
Downbeat and CD Review, and ma—
jor chart success in Billboard and
CM] magazines

Over the last decade, music legr

ends Dizzy Gillespie, Danny Barker,
Dr. Joltn, Branfold Mtirsttlis. and
Elvis Costello have mnde guest ap-
pearances on The Dirty Dozen's re-
cordings. They have collaborated on
albums by The Neville Brothers,
Sonia Dada, Phll Alvill, Manhattan
Transfer and Elvis Costello.

They also appear on tlte upcom-
ing Black Crowes release. In fact,
“The Dozen" dcbuled tltetr new

lineup last year on a tht‘ecdrtotllh tour
with the Black Crowcs, regularly
joining the group onstage after their
own supporting set. They have also
shared the bill irt recent years with
artists as diverse as Ray Charles, The
Grateful Dead. Bonnie Rattt, Los
Lobos and Miles Davis.

This version of Tllc Dirty Dozen
has refocused the group’s irrepressA
ible innovative cnergtes down av.
enues previously unexplored 7 by
The Dozen. or any other group, for
that matter.

While it is difficult to keep up with
the band literally (it tours continue
ously) and in terms of its musical
advances, there is one fact that needs
no update. The invitation for, more
accurately, demand — that The Diny
Dozen places on their listeners to
dance is the common underlying
thread in all of the group’s music.
And as theirJourttey progresses. mu-
sic never before heard by any ears
continues to surge through the wall
to millions oflistellcrs worldwide.

 

Dorr wide open for drummers

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

_ In the past several weeks, more
signs have appeared on campus pub-
licizing groups for percussionists.
Both World Hand Drumming Group,
a.k.a, Drum Circle, and Percussion

, Ensemble are being taught and or-
ganized by Mark Dorr of the music

, department. 6 percent of the college
enrolls in a course taught by Dori.

World Hand Drumming Group is

' a class for people wanting to either

‘ learn or improve upon hand drum-

; mingskills.MarkDorrnotedthatthis

. is the only class offered in a college
in the midwest focusing on hand
drumming. In this class, students

‘ learn hand drumming techniques
from around the world, then apply

'- them to music from the native counr
try. ‘

= Approximately 40 people are en-
rolled in the course, which has ﬁve

" sections. This allows for small group

. instruction, and more interaction be-

, tween the students and Don. Dorr

3 plans for an open jam session every

. semester to unite all the sections to-

' gether. and to invite others from the

, college who enjoy hand drumming.

‘ Dorr, who has learned drumming

‘_ from professional musicians’from

.- around the world, uses ltls studies

I with Bobby Sanabria and Pancho

' Sanchez to help teach the course.
Music that is presented in the World

1 Hand Drumming course includes

, Brazilian, African, Mexican, and

j Caribbean styles. He finds it essen-

: tial to study from musicians from the

I country where the rhythm originated.

, and to learn the actual rhythms. He

‘_ stresses the need for “the real, actual

- thing."

Percussion Ensemble is another

I percussion group led by Dorr. It con-

, sists of 16 members playing various

percussion instruments, from ma-
rimba to Conga drums. In contrast
to World Hand Drumming Group, it
requires music reading skills. PercusA
sion Ensemble performs original
compositions, and also arrangements
of classical and contemporary mur
sic. Among the pieces that are in the
works for the next concert include
jazz, salsa, and a handclappin g piece.
The ensemble performs about two or
three concerts per semester.

Both groups began four or five
years ago, when Dorr was ap-
proached by former high school per-
cussionists looking for a group in
which to play. World Hand Drum-

“The students here
are great.”

ming Group actually was conceived
to introduce people to percussion,
with the idea that they would evenr
rually progress to private lessons.

Private studio lessons are a also
part of Dorr's work. He teaches lesr
sons on practically every percussion
instrument available. Dorr’s theory
regarding curriculum in private lesr
sons is unique for every studettt, tair
lored to ﬁt the needs rind talents of
the student, His goal for every stu-
dent, whethcr in private lessons,
Hand Drumming, or Percussion En-
semble, is for an improvement. One
of the most satisfying aspects of
teachtng is “seeing people develop
their techniques, talents, and inter-
ests." Don said.

Dorr‘s philosophy about percus-
sion is based on beingawellrroundcd
musician, Because there is an “en-
tire realm of world percussion," said

Dorr, percussionists need to be “very
fluent with lots of different instrue
merits " Not only is this evident In
his instructton ofWorld Hand Drum—
ming Group, it is seen tn his studies
as a percussronist

Although he is currently working
on his doctorate at the University of
Iowa. Dorr has studied for years in
many different genres, His perfor»
mance credits include such famous
and varied artists such as Dave
Brubeck. John Denver, The 5th Di-

mension, alld Mannheim Steam-
roller. He li ' ‘lso spent extensive
time with o ‘stltls in Cleveland,
New York, nnd is now playing with
the Ccdai Rnpids Symphony. Don

Wisconsm Reggae Troupe
Headlines Alice

BY KURT ORZECK
Arts Editor

Natty Nation will headline the
Alice ill Wonderland festival tomor-
row, playing from 4:00 until 8:30,

Their music is a combination of
rcgguc and rock, though their website
more accurately describes their

Jazz it up tb‘r‘tl’g' t in

sound as “chunky, guitarrdnven posi»
tive reggae."

Reputedly, they perforrn a “politi-
Cally and soctallyrconscious musical
celebration of everything from
psychedelia to Bob Marley to Black
Uhuru to dancehall,“ or so says B.J.
Huchtemann of the Nebraska
Reader.

Formed in February l996, Natty
Nation consist of lead singer/bass
player Demetrius “Jah Boogie"
Wainwright, lead guitarist/vocalist
Steven “Cup of Tea" Cadle, drum»
mer Pcter “Ras Ktkit" Johnston,
rhythm guitarist Jeffrey “Frazmo”
Maxwell, and percussionistAnthony
Paul “Pauly" Willis. Four of the
members were raised in Wisconsin,
while Maxwell grew up in Jamaica
and Cadle In England.

Recently, the band hasjust com
pleted a series of shows starting in
Wisconsin, traveling towards the
East Coast and then heading back.
After their Grinnell show, they plan
to continue touring the Midwest
through the month of October.

Natty Nation have opened for
Burning Spear, The Itals, Shaggy,
The Meditations. and Tony Rebel.
Their influences Include the Grater
ful Dead, though the Twin Cities City
Pages likened their sound to Third
World and Steel Pulse.

The National Association of Inder
pendent Record Distributors nomir
hated their debut and most recent al—
butn The Journey Has Ills! Begun
for Best New Reggae CD of 1996.

The same album received an “out-
standing" review by Reggae Report
and has enjoyed success on college
radio stations in Madison, Milwaue
kee, and Chicago.

Rhythm Music magazine said, “At
their best, Natty Nation create an en-
gaging, Americanized roots' reggae
that unites many longhaired tribes,

be they nappy or
shaggy a good
study of rock steady,
roots and dub evi-
dence that the best
roots reggae material
these days is being
created off-island.“

The band will
record their second
album in Madison,
due for a December 5
release. Natty Nation
will prepare the al-
bum in Butch Vig's
Smart Studios. Vig,
a member of Gar-
bage, has produced,
among other bands,
Nirvana.

According to the band, they are
“on ajourney and their mission is to
spread the music and word of Jah
the elimination of negatrve vibra»
tion.“ Their musical message also
preaches environmental conscious»
ness, unity, and spirituality.

Also, the band has a reputation for
not participating in “needless, soul-
less tributes to “ganja“utrue
Rastafarians have no more need of

perience came when the band played
a surprise show at the Hangar in Illi-
nois. According to the Illinois
Carbandalel, “the group’s last-
minute, unadvertised performance at
the Hangar 9 at the beginning ofthe
spring drew a huge crowd that left
buzzing about their unique roots-
rock reggae." '

The band hopes that in the future
they can tour full~time and play for
a living.

The band members range in age
from 24 to 38. Their varied back-
grounds include the following: Wain.
wright played for a heavy metal band
Eminence as a boy, Cadle learned
guitar when he was five, Johnston
played the bugle while in the service,
Maxwell used to sing in a church
choir, and Willis was a member of
the hard funk band Fruit Salad.

Natty Nation is a member of
R.A,W. (Reggae Ambassadors
Worldwide). Their international
bond stretches even funher, as some
foreign countries have played the
band on the radio.

Nine months ago, the band cel»
ebrated the anniversary of Bob
Marley’s birthday in Champaign, I1»
linois. At the Blind Pig, the band
varied the traditional reggae sound
with their own harmonized touch.

Reggae Report said ”when you
embark on The Journey Has Just
Begun..., you will find yourself on a
spiritually conscious ride en route to
a nation renewed with hope and love.

One of the band's more prominent
performances came last March in
Austin, Texas. For ﬁve days, the
South By Southwest music convene

20,000 people and 600 bands took
part in the festival.

Natty Nation played at the Fla-

the result was a venue “so
