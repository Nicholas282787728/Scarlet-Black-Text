MOURNERS

by Ed Laing

I'm glad to learn that Grin-
nelrs "every-mealma-social-expers
ience" tradition is being upheld
by the c of HP. it’s okay to

come to dinner wearing an old,-

crusty pair of ten work pants,
cowboy boots, 3 string the and

reinstated second semester if the
new drinking rule is successful.
(Dr. Stevens also Says that the
idea of having a college-owned
station wagon for designated
studentvuse is worth Consider-
ing further.)

In Spite of all the Current
‘concern about drinking at Grin-
nell, I keep remembering the
recent series of “This Week”
articles on college drinking that
was published as a result of a
survey of many thousand col-
lege students. It held that the

“They sure have a lot of moose on their team."

Let’s Get Started

It was good to hear Roger Perry begin the. year with
a renewal of the drive for a general overhauling of the
formal machinery of student government.

 

At Grinnell, student government now resembles an old
house that began as a one room cabin and that just grew
as its owner’s family grew—a new bedroom for every child.
For too many years, Grinnell’s only answer to a major
problem has been the creation of a new committee, board,
)r council equipped with virtual independence and a con-
stitution all of its own.

The student body realized it when they voted over-
whelmingly in favor of Perry’s general proposal last spring.
A lot was accomplished last spring, too, and it should con-
tinue this semester with added vigor.

Perhaps the unfortunate blow to student government
that occurred when the C of HP was forced to relinquish
either the responsibility for enforcing the drinking rule or
their places as members of their halls could have been
avoided by a clearer deﬁnition of responsibility among
student government agencies.

But at any rate, work should begin, and move quickly.

Two dollar fines for first
fenses of misconduct in the d‘
Eng room were given to a Smith
sophomore and a south Younker
junior. A $1 fine was assessed
against a Gates senidr for breach
of dining room dress.

As requested, Dean of Men
Henry Brown will in the future
be given notations by the coun-
cil an disciplinary actions in the
halls no' later than the third
oiiense.

Policy for visiting men in the
iniirmary will be to obtain the

Letters

To the Editor:

1 have been asked to write a
letter explaining more clearly
the true facts about the drink—
ing rule aiter is revision over
the summer months. It seems
that there has been misunder.
standing of the general concept
or this change and it should be
made clear at this, the beginning
of the year.

The point that should be em-
phasized is the fact mat ndw
the responsibility rests in the
hands of each and every student.
He is responsible not only col,
himself but to his mm and his
hall mates and a Violation of this
rule resule in his suspensidn‘
from school and may (in cases
of extreme violation in one hall)
place that particular hall on
social probation. ln other words,
this responsibility has been re-
moved from the hands of a few
and placed in the hands of many.
The administration of coure, is
the disciplinary force behind
this new rule and they hope, as
do you, that no such action will
be required.

Good luck to you all.

Sincerely
Roger Perry

 

Student Cduncil president
