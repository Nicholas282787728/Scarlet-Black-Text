9 September 1983

by James Ryo Kiyan

dow i saw that people were sitting on the
grass, silently watching the sky turn
scarlet over the west. I went outside and
crossed the lawn, already cool with the
evening dew. Everyone was there. I sat
with them, A breeze brushed our faces just
as bright orange clouds brushed the
darkening sky. 1 turned my head to look at
a bright star in the east, and noticed with
pleasure that everyone else was looking at
the same star with the same sublime inner

peacefulness.

Suddenly, everyone pulled out family
size tubes of Crest and began dropping
them onto the ground and laughing. i
realized then that I recognized no one, yet
somehow everyone was strangely
familiar. I felt a bit queasy, I don’t know
why, and decided the best remedy was to
get a Coke, I got up, Everyone jumped up
at the same time I did. As I walked
towards the Coke machine the crowd grew
thick, everyone wanted a Coke, and
everyone was gomg to the same Coke
machine. I was growing panicky I knew
what I had to do. I started running back
towards the dorm As one, the masses
turned and began sprinting in the same
direction, I was near the front of the Crowd
and pushed my way up the steps. Along
with twenty others I burst into the
bathroom, followed by hundreds, and, I
thought, to my horror, probably billions,

Scarlet & Black

I grabbed my toothpaste, It was the
toothpaste 7 it had to be, I opened the Cap
and began to squeeze the contents onto the
floor, The toothpaste. It became a chant,
audible from deep within the throats of the
hundreds now converging upon the dorm,
“Toothpaste, toothpaste." The bathroom
was now jammed with writhing bodies,
each one intent upon emptying his tube of
toothpaste. The pressure and the heat was
unbearable as hundreds, maybe thousands

more, struggled to get into the bathroom.
At last, the tube was empty I felt cool air.
I stumbled forward, dizzy, sweating, and
fell into the sink, I was alone.

Milton, my roommate, came in, already
dressed in his drab, reddishrbrown
bathrobe. He began brushing his teeth at
the sink beside me.

still shaking, I looked up at him He was
frowning at himself in the mirror, For the
first time, I Saw him and was not over-
come by powerful feelings of contempoand
hatred.

I crawled over to him on my knees and
grabbed his robeWith’one hand

"Milton," lsaid, "I love youjust the way
you are. We don‘t have to fight, l'll never
try to impose my values on you again
Don‘t ever change. for anyone utopia is
nothing more than a personal vision."

“Damn moths are dying all over my
desk again,” he said.

Child’s Play: The Lessons We

Teach Our Children

by Nathan Anders on

The children discovered the old globe in
a garbage can filled with the debris of the
elementary school's summer cleaning.
They claimed it for their own, although

they might have pleaded with Howard to _

let them have it. The white-haired janitor,
who had opened the fire hydrant to “clean
it out" on the hottest day of July, would
have hardly refused such a request.
Whether they asked or not, the children
marched out of the school to the
playground with the globe held high.

The kids who had not gone on this ex-
pedition were sitting in the schoolyard
grass discussing various important topics:
the dead crow in the parking lot,
firecrackers, fishing, and how often I
shave. The sight of the approaching globe
snatched their attention away from even
these issues, and they scrambled to get a
closer look, Their laughter grew loud as
the glnbecarriei-s began to toss their prize
back and forth while singing, “I’ve got the
whole world, in my hands. . l "

Depsite my objections (“Aw c'mon,
don‘t wreck it"), passing soon turned into
punting, The globe split along the equator
and broke in half. After a moment of in-
tense inspection by all to see what really is
inside a globe, each hemisphere was grab-
bed by a kid and worn like a helmet. This
'00 made for a rather ridiculous spectacle,
and soon everyone was laughing again. At
the height of the merriment, the boy who
was wearing the Northern Hemisphere at
a cocky angle took off his hat, turned to me
with a smile, and plced his fist on the Asian
continent, “Kill Russia," he said.

Child’s play 7 nothing but a child’s play.
But even an affected hatred is conspicuous
when children play because we sense that
it does not belong. Few, if any, children
could be capable of hating somcﬂiing as
abstract as the Soviet Union, During my
work with children this past summer I
began to wonder why then this boy, and
other children like him, had come to
associate “Russia" with ”enemy," and

what the consequences of this association
may be. I came to realize that all of us who
have an influence on children and are
capable of hate share in the blame for
these occurrences of enemy identification.
Children are quick to pick up on the reac-
tion of adults to the world, and the pre-
judice with which we often replace
realistic judgement in regards to the USSR
is notan exception. In a very real sense we
are responsible for our children dividing
their Capture the Flag teams into
“Russia" and “America,”

We also share in the consequences of
these phenomena. Hate is a powerful emo~
tion that blinds more effectively the more
deeply it is rooted, To plant its seeds in the
minds of today’s children is to do them,
and us, a great disservice in the future. A
complicated world will greet tomorrow’s
world citizens, and our only hope of surviv-
ing rests in future leaders coming to power
with their eyes wide open. This is not to say
that the Soviet government is to be
presented to our children as a lovable tedr
dy bear. It should not; the Soviet govern
ment does much to enhance our children‘s
hazy conception of the USSR as an enemy.
Shooting down civilian planes and in
vading countries does little to inspire one
to love, and makes it difficult for us not to
have a feeling of antagonism that spreads
to our children.

Yet the USSR is more than its govern
ment, and within its borders live
thousands of children who, like children
everywhere, can only mimic hate. These
children are also being compelled to envi-
sion an enemy 7 the United States. It is
frightening to think that we adults of the
world have already begun pitting the come
batants of the next world war against each
other. We must realize that no one will sur-
vive if we continue to force our hatreds on
our children. The simple lesson we have
not yet learned is to allow a child’s play to
remain child’s play.

 

On Stanley Kubrick’s

Creative Violence
by Wes Joe

“It‘s funny how the colours of the real
world only seem really real when you vid»
dy them on the screen "

These words, spoken by Alex Burgess in
A Clockwork Orange, best express my

response to those who would censor this ‘

film, Doubtless many people found
violence in A Clockwork Orange beyond
any “needs” of Mr. Kubrick. Veteran
Grinnellians will recall that even the
grotesque film Eraserhead did not
generate such advance controversy.
Orange affects people by breaching their

settled expectations of “clean" or.

"Hollywood” violence Nasty violence is
improper in a Saturday night flick Fidr
diesticksl To quickly condemn oi-aiige
without careful study, however, would be
to close one‘s mind to an amazing work of
art.

There are, I think, particular reasons
why director Stanley Kubrick could not
have made Orange as powerful viithout its
ugliest scenes Violent crime in orange is
a consequence of free will, a motif central
to the film. Freedom empowers Alex and
his friends to rape and kill. Likewise, free
will permits the sex and power drives to
encourage human history‘s most heinous
atrocities Orange forces this point with
dramatic intensity when Alex crushes a
woman to death with a ceramic penis
sculpture

Explicit violence rarely makes a film
endearing. tThough Grinnell audience
laughter during rupc scenes inspire
wonder here.) Yet, the offensive scenes in
Orange faithfully mirror pure evil to elicit
a particular response, namely our revulr

sion, Such a portrait of reailty is
deliberately drawn for two reasons First
ly, the film imparts Kubrick's general
disgust with the evil consequences of
human free will. Secondly, inspiring terror
in the audience is important for the
arguments in the film‘s second portion, i.e.
Alex's "cure”, to be most effective.

Kubrick must create conflict with us and
hurt us not only to impress us with his
seriousness, but also to enable its to better
understand those who, to borrow a phrase
from Eric Fromm, would escape from
freedom and jettison free will To
"reform“ Alex, the government
transforms him into a being without free
will Though he retains flesh and organs,
his mind is without freedom, (Hence the
films title i This is a marvelous mixture
of liberal political theory's problems and
B r Skinner, ignited by Anthony Burgess
vision of an imposing technocratic state It
is also the nightmare of a society so
desperate for security. that it will forfeit
the capacity for choice. its human capaci-

ty.

Because we have been affected by the
film's violence. we can sympathize with a
state whose line reads, no matter what
cost involved. "The point is that it works.‘
We sympathize with the ltiinister of the in
terior only because we have felt the
presence of violence in the theater,

No one may claim that Kubrick's film is
powerful despite "exceSSive" violence.
The impositon of this creative violence
upon viewers is precisely the source of
orange-s effectiveness

Fear of Speaking

by Bob Stryker

“And, of course, during the second week
of November, everyone shall deliver a
speech. . , " Stop. When a professor uses
the word “speech”, many hears stop
behavmg the way they ought to, and he or
she need not go any further, as the rest will
fall on deaf ears,

”A speech?!” the panic-stricken mind
jumps in, “Oh, sadness and grief!” or
course this assignment is a blatant per-
sonal attack, so one becomes defensive:
“What harm have I done unto thee, oh
great wise one, that you would treat me so
harshly?” then the morals speak up, ads
ding: “Now, now, this person whom you
refer to so sarcastically, is merely assign»
ing a project that will teach you a valuable
skill Called: Public Speaking. After a
pause the area of the brain that contains
the most rudimentary knowledge of law
cxclaims: “Freedom of speech is a right
which should never be arbitrarily forced
upon anyone, , . at least in a top level
general lit. studies course.” The obvious
solution to this plight is to haul your
trembling carcass out or that class, and
enroll it into something safe 7 like pot-
tery.

It, however, you do not make that very
wise choice, there are a few ﬁlings that you
can do to ease the pain and impending
tragedy of public speaking.

First of all, get a hold of yourself! You’re
being silly to get all worked up over
nothing!

Recognizing your irrational fear of
public speaking is an important step. Un-
fortunately, that will not change things in

the slightest' a fear is a tear whether it is
rational or not, Those who fear speaking in
front of large, menacing groups know with
confidence that the whole world will tum-
ble down upon them the moment that first
head of sweat forms on their brow, or when
they stumble over the phrase: "Gadies
and Lentlemen”. '

Once you understand that you don’t
understand your irrational fear, tat least
you think you do) then you had best go on
to researching for the nightmare. Say, why
not go to the library for that7 While you
are there you might want to browse
through the many books they have about
public speaking. These books contain some
good tips like: “Be yourself”, "Act
naturally", “Don‘t get excited”, and
”Carry yourself properly."

I can think of a few “don'ts” that these
books probably neglect:

1. Don't drool on yourself.

2. Don’t say things like:
ibblemooff! ”

3, Don’t forget to breathe

4. Don’t snuff it.

Anyway, getting back to the speech pro-
cess you might want to organize your
research a bit. It might be smart to write it
down too. _

Rehearse. Rehearse, rehearse,
rehearse, rehearse. Rehearsal for doom.
Doom is coming and (pupil doom is here
and you give your speech and boy was it
terrible! You made a right fool of yourself,
but (what the heck), it's over. You can rest
easy now.

But wait ’til next semester.

“P-p-pr
