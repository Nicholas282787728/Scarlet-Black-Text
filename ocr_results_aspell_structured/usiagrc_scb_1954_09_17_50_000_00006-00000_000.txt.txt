fThe s & B Pledge Card

“Tliere’ll Be Some Changes Made" goes the refrain all
an old tune, Can't remember hearing it on the Top Ten list,
yet it seems to have enjoyed some popularity in Grinnell'
this summer. Dr. Stevens resignation “with the greatest
good will” and Kent Andrew’s rather i'il'ey resignation from
the drama department head the list.

Buildings and Grounds has done its bit to brighten the
campus. We are also glad to note some policy changesi
< namely a pledge card which acknowledges that good citizen-
ship is more than obedience to two rules. alid an indeterm-
inate sentence for violation of the drinking rule.

We’d like to get into the act and see some more
changes made by and for the students. We have plenty of
time ahead of us—eight months We have the desire. We
have the moral stamina.

With a new academic year ahead of us it seems ape
propriate to make a few affirmations pertinent to change,
a pledge card so to speak.

We will work for the rapid approval of the new con—
stitution in tlle form most realistic and most beneficial to
the student body.

We will work for a more sensible and less stringentl
out rule.

We will attempt to encourage more close relations be
tween faculty and students on the non-academic, non»gov~
ei'nmental level.

We will continue to be an interested and active rather
than apathetic segment of the student body.

. If activity overcomes apathy in the attitude of the
student body, “Tliere’ll be some changes made,"
