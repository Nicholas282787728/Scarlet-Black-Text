,Drake Cinder
Artists Defeat
Grinnell Team

Pioneers Win Four Firsts;
Bulldogs Win Mile

Relay Event

Although showing an improvement
over their pcrfon'nances at Iowa last
week, the Pioncer track team proved
no match for Drake in their annuaT
indoor dual with the Bulldogs held
last night, and took the short end of a
55.39 score.

The Pioneers’ strength was concen.
trated in the field cvean, in which
all but one Grinnell first was won.
Partybok added another good pelfol'm.
ancc to that against the Hawkeycs when
he topped all the Bulldog pole vault.
crs with a leap ol 11 feet 10 inches.
Meeter, in the shot put, and Knapheide
and Dickinson, who tied in the high
jump, and Clark, in the low hurdles,
were the other Grinnell winners.

New Record mlablished

Jim Langlas cut lose with one of
the best jumps of his career to force
the Drake winner in the broad jump.
Dorenz. to a~new meet mark. Lang.
las Cleared more than 21 feet, but the
Bulldog sophomore soared 22 feet 5
3.4 inches to outdo the Pioneer.

The most disappointing race for the
Grinnell outfit was the mile relayr
which the Drake quartet took in the
time of 3:383, more than 10 seconds
slower than the time of the Grin.
nellians against Iowa last Saturday.
The smallness of the Drake track was
partially responsible for the poor time;
however.

Speaker Defines
Character of Art
in Lecture Here

An is an integral pan of life and
develops along with history, stated
Oscar B. Jacobson, professor of art
at the University of Oklahoma, while
speaking on “The Character of Art"
belol'c an audience in Herrick chapel
Thursday evening. Because the art.
ist is the interpreter of his time, he
progress of the world may be traced
in the fine arts of the various periods,
he pointed out.

“Nations and races have character
just as individuals, and the character.
lstlcs of their arts are determined by
such factors as religion, climate, and
occupations," the speaker maintained,

Difficult to Deﬁne

Although art is difficult to deﬁne,
Mr. Jacobson believes it to be the joy
in creative things, with work and
play its inspiration. All arts are
inter.related, though different in ex.
pression, he declared.

Mr. Jacobson observed that the rhy.
thmic pace of the camel is reﬂected in
Arabian music, and loneliness in the
cowboy ballads. Contrary to the ac.
cepted belief that modem jazz is an
outgrowth of negro music, Mr. Ja.
cobson insisted, " it was invented by
Henry Ford7and others who have
made life complicated and comfort.
able.” In this way, its tempo reflects
the modern mode of living.

Period Characteristics

Some of the Characteristics of the
different periods of an, the speaker
reflected—are eternity for Egypt,
beauty for Greece, and strength for
Rome. “Greek art comes Closer to
perfection than that of any other per.
iod,” he declared, “and it is intelli—
gent because it is not concerned with
constructing the tallest building or
producing the largest potato,"

Contrasting the respective reactions
cf scientists and artists when observ.‘
ing a mountain or ocean, Mr. Jacob.
son noted that the scientist sees atoms
and density, while the artist sees
beauty.

“Civilization," he concluded, “is
iudged by fine arts, of which the per.
iods are representations of spiritual
;nspiration ,,

Sze to Present
Main Address

at Graduation

No’ted Diplomat From China
Has Appeared Before
at Grinnell

ScaeKe Alfred Sze. the Chinese min.
istcr to the United states, has been
selected as the commencement speaker
for 1935, according to Prof, E B.
T. Spencer. chairman of the Grinnell
lecture course committee. Mr. Sze
has appeared before at Grinnell.

Professor Spencer, in commenting
upon the man, says that he is very
satisfactory as a public speaker, his
wonderlul personality contributing
largely to his success.

Family Prominent

A member of one of the prominent
families of China, Mr. Sze was given
all advantages in securing an excell.
ent education, He attended SL John’s
college in Shanghai, China, and later
received an A. B. degree [rum Cornell
university. in 1902, he was granted
a master of arts degree from the same
institution,

When the Chinese empire was over.
thrown and a democratic system was
set up in 1912, Mr. Sze became the
acting minister to France under the
first republican cabinet of China.

Acts as Diplomat

Since that time he has taken an
active part in Chinese and world pol.
itics. He was a delegate to the Paris
Peace conference in 1918, to the Wash.
ington Arms conference in 1922, and
to the League of Nation’s meeting for
the settlement of the Chino.Japancse
trouble,

Mr. Sze should be of even more in.
terest to the Grinnell audience be.
cause of his connections with the col.
lege. He is a personal friend of Pro.
lessor Spencer, who speaks highly of
him as a gentleman and a diplomat.

Grinnell Benefactor

Several years ago he made a sub.
stantial gift to a GrinnelLsttered in.
stltutiol-l, Grinnell_in_China, Mr. Sze,
himself a Phi Beta Kappa, is educaf.
ing his Children in the United States
and England.

The westerner has a distorted
of the situation in China, according
to the minister. In attempting to clar.
ify this idea, Mr. Sze has pointed out
that China is not in a state of demoral.
ization, because her reconstructive
measures show that she is progressive.

Desires independance

China has a strong desire to be a
country governed without foreign in.
terierence or influence for she has
worked out plans to bring about eco.
nomic, social, cultural, and political
order which she wishes to put into
effect.

Although the Chinese people have
been backward in the past, Mr, Sze
contends that they are now wide.
awake and progressive. Mr. Sze real.
izes that China needs the friendship
of the United States and he declares
that she realizes this also.

 

Demand for Receive Books
Shows Steady Increase

in Recent Years

Evidence that Gl'innell students have
shown an increasing interest in books
during the last mne yours is brought
out in an analysis of llle circulation
of the college library, Since the col.
lege year 1925.25, the number of re.
'vc books issued per student has
increased 75 per cent, while the nllm.
ber of books issucfl for home use has
increased 78 per cent.

In 1925.26, cacll student drew cut
51.2 reserve books for use in the read—
ing room, and 132 books, not on re.
serve, for homc usc. From then on
,thcie was a steady increase in both
classes until a peak was reached in
1928.29. In that year the figure for
reserve books was 691 and for home
books 22.6.

Audience Gives
Blum Composition
Great Applause

By RICHARD KUNCL, ‘35.

The organ.piano program presented
last evening in Herrick chapel by
Elias Blllm and Elsie Haggard Ryan
was decidedly an achievement for both
of the artists. The organ.piano num.
bers and the compositions for the in.
dividual hummenu were done with
extraordinary delicacy and exactness,
and the obvious. careful manipulation
of the instruments in their relation to
each other was done with such pro.
ficiency that the two instruments entire.
ly blended into one except at times
they were imitating each other—a fact
the audience readily comprehended,
showing their appreciation by undivid.
ed attention.

The opening of the program with V

the Franck “Prelude, Fugue and Vari.
ation" for both organ and plane, was
of a mild nature compared to the gran.
diose fashion in which the pro.
gram ended, with the composition by
Mr. Blum, called “Symphonic Varia.
tions," for the organ, and aggrandized
by the college orchestra.

There was a gradual heightening of
effect as this last number proceeded
in modem chord progressions, and
when the gigantic climax came the
great applause could only have been
increased by Lhe audience rising from
is seat and acclaiming its success with
even greater vigor.
