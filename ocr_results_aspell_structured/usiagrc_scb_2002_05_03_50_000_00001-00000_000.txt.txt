Paul Ford Y02 resigned as SGA President last weekend following
charges ofsexual misconduct. Four members oFSGA met with Ford
on the morning Saturday, Apr|127 and asked him to step down by 6
pm.

The chaigcs allege various incidents ofsexual misconduct on Ford’s
part over the course ofthe past year, one ofwhich could be classed as
a felony under lows law.

OCCO Senator Brandon Zicha ’02 said he was
approached by a friend, also a constituent, about
an incident which she said occurred on Tuesday,
April 16 in Ford's ofﬁce. Ziclia knew of another
individual who had reported an incident involving
Ford last year, and said he “helped to bridge the
gap" btiween the nvo.

Zicha said the person who told him about hot
year’s incident had engaged in dialogue with Ford
and thought the matter had been resolved, “When
she discovered that it had happened again, she was
mortiﬁed," he said.

zicha said hearing about the more recent ineic
dent prompted her to come forward.

Both women decided to write letters to Zicha
detailing their allegations ayinst Ford. zicha presented the many
mous statements to SGAVice President Gabe Rosenberg, who called
a erbinet meeting on Friday night to discuss the accusations.

“Gabe proceeded to lay out what he was going to do. which was
to meet with Paul and ask for his resignation,” said one cabinet
member, who asked to remain anonymous. “Cabinet throw their
support behind Gabe pretty much unanimously."

Rosenberg risked Ford to meet with him on Saturday at 11 mm,
along with Zicha, representing the plaintiffs; l—laiiies senator Damien

The group asked Ford to resign by 6 pm, making it cicrr that
Zicha would publicly release the two letters of complaint ifirc did
not step down. They also told Ford that impeachment proceedings
would likely result,

Zicha said he received Ford’s letter of resignation, which Ford
had also sent to the rest ofloint Board, at 5:59 pm

Ford said that he felt he had no choice but to resign,"lf1 had not
resigned, this matter would have been brought be»
fore Joint Board," he said. “It would have meant
those accusations would be publicized through Joint
Board, and there would essentially have been a
public trial ofme, as the sitting chairofjornt Board
and beyond that being incredibly awkward, it
would have been incredibly messy and ugly.”

Zicha indimted that he would have either ini-
tiared or supported impeachment proceedings if
Ford had not resigned. The SGA constitution states
that the president can be impeached by a [\Voethirds
majority in Joint Board or a petition of 200 stun
dents on campus. impeachment must be followed
within one week by a campus-wide referendum, in
which a nvo-thirdsrmajority otstudenns voting is
required to remove the president from office,

Ford complained dint he had not been able to speak to cabinet
about the accusations. “If you are gomg to be charged with some.
thing as egregious as these accusations are, i think it's a matter ordue
process that you be allowed to answer to those accusations," he 51ch

“I don’t think it would have been appropriate" to have Ford at
the meeting, Rosenberg said. “I stand by that decision 100 percent,"
Rosenberg said that cabinet would probably not have been able to
deliberate openly ifFord had been present.

Ford said that die 6 pm, deadline forced him to make a decision
