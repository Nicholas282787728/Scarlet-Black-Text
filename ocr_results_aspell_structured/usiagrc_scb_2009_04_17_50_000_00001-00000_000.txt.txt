Faculty concerns over Student Affairs investigated

BYARI ANisrcLb, PAT CALDWELL, DAVm
LOGAN 8L CHLor. MORVL

At an ad hoc faculty meeting held Feb 4,
a group of professor-s distributed a document
claiming to provide evidence of foul play in
hiring and tiring practices within the Ofrrce of
Student AffairsThe document (which is avail-
able at www.thesandb.com) gave a detailed
outline which argued that the circumstances
under which former Associate Dean and Die
rector of Residence Life Sheree Andrews was
placed on leave were improper. The docu-
ment also questioned, among other things, the
college's hiring of Dean of Students Travis
Greene and the response to faculty complaints
by President Russell K. Osgood.

An ScStB revicw of documents from An-
drews' pcrsonncl ﬁle, which was obtained from
mrrltiple sources, confrrmed mrrch of the int
formarron relating to Andrews departure from
Student Affairs, while individuals involved in
Gi'eenc's hiring disprrted some of the docue
ment’s suggestions ofncpotism.

The faculty associated with the docuV
ment’s production and distribution—many
of whom signed a damning letter- to the edi-
tor in the Dec 12, 2008 edition of the 5&3
criticizing the manner in which Student Aft
fairs and the president handled Andrews' (let
parml‘eieontinued to publicize and promote
their grievances. Partially as a result, the Col-
lege is planning to conduct an external review
of all administrative hiring and ﬁring practices
However, faculty have still expressed concern
over how the review will be conducted and also
over the administrative response to charges of
faculty harassment ofstudents.

Andrews‘ departure from Student Affairs

According to documents from her person-
ncl file, Andrews was officially placed on leave
Sept 8, when she received a termination letter
from Vice President of Student A HousV
ton Dougliarry that cited insubordrnation and
general unprofessionalism as reasons for her
leave. “Tire interaction last week with your sue
pervisor is independently a serious matter and
is what precipitated your current leave A
staff member cannot berate a supervisor when
he or she provides constructive feedback It
is unprofessional, rnsubordinate, and shows an

ility to hearcriticis _ d negative evalum
tron,"Dougharty wrote in the letter.

Dougharty was apparently referring to a
confrontation between Andrews and Greene
m which Andrews called her supervisor incxe
perienced, Dorrgharty could not be reached for
comment before publication.

The documents also show that on Sept 4,
Andrews received a corrective action form from
Greene listrng 12 grievances about Andrews
performance under the headings of “profes-
sionalism,” “judgment/role rnoticlrng," “com
munication" and “organ sitron " Many of the
specific crrtrqrres included compl‘ rts of‘hwle
wardly l'cfer[ting] to some inside Jokes with .r
student staff member” during a New Student
Orientation event and “several conversations
with you when you would ask do you like/trust
me? One of the seemingly more substantial
complaints was that student staff... arrived
to campus with no understanding of what
was going on. Student staff training schedules
were not emailed to them in advance [by Ant
drcws] "Greene also reprimanded Andrews
for missing a Deans Group meeting, and gen-

cmlly sketches a pattern of disorganization and
unprofessronalisrn by Andrews.

“Given the severity and totality of these
incidental believe corrective nctiorr is war-
ranted,” Greene wrote.

The clear dissatisfaction with Andrews'
performance expressed in both the corrective
action form and the termination letter con-
trasts strongly with a June 2007 performance
review by former Vice President of Student
Affairs Tom Crady. There, Crady specifrcally
praised Andrews {or her positrve work with
judicial cases and conflict resolution, both ar-
eas that Greene and Dougharty CrliiClZCtLThB
next month, Crady would promote Andrews to
the position ofassociate clean.

on 11 of the forms 12 specific job per-
formance categories, Crady -rndrcated that
Andrews “exceeds expectations," the highest
of three potential assessments in the area of
“customer satisfaction," Andrews was evaluated
as “meeting expectations,”

in addition to the discrepancy between
Antlrcws' evaluations undcr Cnrdy and those
under Greenc and Daugharty, faculty also Cx-
pressed concern about the apparently abrupt
manner in which Andrews’ employment was
tcrm’ itetl, Andrews" termination letter is
dated rust four days after the cortcctrve action
lorm authored by Greene and the rntervenrng
time between the two documents included a
weekend, meaning that Andrews was placed
on leave one business day after receiving the
corrective action form.

According to Osgood and Greene, correc-
tive action forms are meant to be both discr
plinary and rehabilitative As the documents
name implies, one of its primary functions is

to inform employees ofspccifrc areas of subpar
performance and ways to remedy them before
more extreme disciplinary actions are taken.

While Greene said the time afforded an
employee to improve his or her performance
can vary greatly depending upon the specific
situation, generally, “It could go anywhere from
six months to one month. Some places are
pretty rigid as far as how they prescribe it—it
might be you have 30 days to change this be-
havior at which point you’ll be reevaluated
at other times it may be that this serves as a
notice [that] anything more egregious could
certainly jeopardize your ability to be at the
institution, but in principle let's work through
this together,"

Faculty also pointed to extenuating cir»
cumstances in Andrews’ personal life, which
developed at the same time as her strained relar
rronshrp with her supervisorsAt the tune, Ant
drews was experiencing a “personal crisis and
[needed] to attend to her family," the faculty
document read

\Vhrlc Greene said that he could not come
ment on the specifics of Andrews' departure,
he maintrincd that prvocedrncs were followed
in a way that was meant to be supportive and
at the same time followed College policy and
that s probably the mostl can say °'

The faculty document also claimed that
Andrews departure mirrored parallel personnel
changes at Lewis is Clark'Collcge, Doughe
arty's former place of employment The 5&3
has neither Conﬁrmed nor disconfrrmed these
allegations.

Week of pride energizes campus

av CHLOE MORYL

In addition to the traditional red, white, and blue flag
flying outside on the west side of Forum Beach is a more
colorful, more cheerful, and gay flag, It's here, it's queer:
it’s Pride Week.

Pride week ofﬁcially began on Saturday, Apr. 11 with a
BBQlcer on Loose Beach, attended by over 50 students.
“I really like the BBQleer because it’s in front of Loose
so people maybe if they weren’t really sure if they were
going to go they can see it and stop by on their way to
somewhere else," Anna Friel '10 said."1t’s an accessible
place, it's really fun and it's really good for the commu'
nity." Students spent the afternoon mingling and grilling
food—both meat and vegetarian options.

on Monday night, spokeneword poet and activist
Andrea Gibson performed at the Forum south Lounge.
“Liz Ehlinger ['09] approached StoncCo with the idea of
bringing [Gibson] and she’s a really phenomenal spoken
word poet,” said Pride Week organizer Leah Krandcl '09.
“There were a lot ofsrudents that already knew her work
and it was a really great show, a lot of really positive one
era

”Though Gibson was sick for the reading, she per-
formed through her illness and delivered over an hour of
spokencwortl defpoetry. "I was drawn towards it because
I’ve secn some def poets in the past and I think that's a
really neat way to convey ideas and a good media form,
and it definitely was a break from what pride weelt usu»
ally is," said Joey Wendel '11. “Going to hear a personal
narrative and then on top of that being def poetry was a
good cxperiencc".

Another new addition to this year's Pride Week was
the Queer Music and Open Mic Night at Bob's Under-
ground Cafc on Wednesday. Krandel was inspired to inc
cludc this event in Pride Weck's’ festivities after a speaker
at the Midwest LGBT College Conference gave a pre-
sentation concerning support for queer artists in popular

culture today, At the open mic night, students were cn-
couraged to perform songs with queer themes, that were
written by queer artists or just generally gave queer indie
viduals a chance to perform.

“1 think it got people thinking more about who they
listen to that’s queer and why they don't support more
queer music," Krandel said. “it was a nice time to come
together as a community to come and hang out together."

As the kickoff to a religions film series sponsored by
the Center for Religion, Spirituality and Social Justice
and Stonewall Resource Center (SRC), Thursday‘s events
included a viewing of the ﬁlm “Call Me Malcom,” about a
prospective seminary student undergoing a gender transi-
tion from female to male, accompanied by a bakc night
sponsored in part by the Grinnell College Christian Fel-
lowship (GCCF). This collaboration between the GCCF
and the SRC happened for the first time during last year s
pride week, and participants on both sides hope to con-
tinue fostering positive dialogue We felt like stone Co
and GCCF were two groups °rhat might have been pert
eeived to haVe some kind of unresolved tension in the
past," Sara VVoolery’l] said. “These two groups ought to
be reaching out to each other and doing something fun
and that’s where the bake night came the movie came
inirt created a dialogue and discussion element." Lilly
intern Katie Snipes helped to faerlrtarc ‘rl discussion after
the movie.

An allecampus email sent by QPOC member Isaiah
Iboko ’12 notified the studcnt body about the Day ofSlr
lencc, which will be occurring today until also pm The
purpose of the Day of Silence rs to bring attention to
those that have been silenced as a result of their sexual
