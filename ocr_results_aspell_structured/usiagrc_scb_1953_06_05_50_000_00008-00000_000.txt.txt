Slants on Sports

by George Simon

Therell p1obably be some old t1u1e1s who road this paper and
note with d1sgust that the 1952 53 Pioneers didnt win a Midwest
conference championship in any of the eight 111terscholast1c sports
in which G1innell participates. In every sport except football,
howeve1, the local athletes fin1shed among the leadels, no lowe1
than fourth position

And 111 be willing to bet that if those unhappy old ti111e1s1
come back again next year, they 11 see a Grinncll team thats won
a title in some sportiperhaps in several sports. Lets take a look,
at prospects in each sport for next year. i

The gridiron squad will be “Vastly improved" accordingJ to
Coach John Ffitsch. Although weaker in the backfield, the ice
neer line'snould be much stronger with help from the fresh squad 1
and deeper in 1escrve strength. At least 44 men will report for
opening drills The new coaches 1naugurated a new ottenswe pate
tern last fall. and it should be smoothed out nicely aftei a yea1 of
expermientat'ion. The goal: At least four wins

Cross- country prospects havent been as good for many a
year. Paced by Dave Qutuh, a sophomore, the harriers finished 1
fourth this season, and Coach E. G. Booth thinks that they ;

Last season's basketball Pioneers were picked by opposing
coaches to finish last but they almost won the crown and fine
ished in third place. if all confe1enee center Bob Winter can get
used to the new glass backboards which have been ordered for
this winter, he could well lead the Pionee1s to the championship.
He ll have lots of strong help

Coach Bob Petersons wrestlers wont beat Cornells pc1ennial
champs, but they have a good chance to 1epeat in the number two
spot they took last March. Peterson says, “We'll be tougher than
last yea1, but we’ll have trouble heating Coe” I think they will.
