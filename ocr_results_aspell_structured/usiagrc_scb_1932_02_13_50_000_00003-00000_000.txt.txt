lnstructive Map
Shows Late News
in Graphic Form

Considerable speculatiun has been
prevalent among students and fac~
any members the last week regard-
ing the authors and purpose of the
colored map adorning the trophy case
in the Corridor between the library
and Alumni Recitation hall.

It was generally assumed that the
history department was responsible
for the new “curiosity," but inquiries
have revealed that the Sunday EV
ning club represented by Joseph Con—
ard, in co-operation with the Young
Men's Christian association, repre—
sented by Hubul't Pye, erected the
map with the intention of distributing
peace information 01‘ other inter-
national news to those interested.

The current Peace conference at
Geneva really inspired the map idea,
according to Mr. conard. Painting
was done by King Park,

Students who otherwise might neg.
lect reading Wul’ld news or give but
a, hurried glance to such topics have
been attracted and lured by the
bright colors and curious network 0f
strings on the mnp to actually rend
and reflect on the Des Moines Regis-
ter clippings attached below. Charles
Payne, professor of European history,
says, “I regard it as one of the most
instructive things ever done in this
school.” l“

Clippings are cut from the Des
Moines Register only, but Mr. Con-
ard and lVIr. Pye, the carnmlt'tee in
charge, expect to add excerpts from
The Manchester Guardian, The New
York Times, and the Christian Sci-
,ence Monitor.

In conjunction with the map. the
committee has posted uprtD-the-min-
u‘te news on the bulletin board around
the corner, and has announced that
bulletins of both today's ﬁnd yester-
day’s news soon will be available to
Students there.

Marquette Downs
Grinnell, 43-29

After playing sluggish basketball
throughout the first half to trail 26-
14, the Grinnell Pioneers made a des-
perate stand in the last period against
Marquette university's Golden Ava-
lanche at Milwaukee Thursday night,
but the gap was too great to over-
come and they lost. 43729. Although
weakened by the loss of Budrunas
and Ranzani, the Milwaukee five piled
up a commanding lead early in the
game never to be headed.

The Iowa team was determined not
to let the game descend to a. walk
away, end led by Hank Duncan, bat-
tled on even terms with the Hilltopr
pers through the last half. The
lengthy southpaw continued his tor-
rid pace set in previous games, and
walked off with high scoring honors
for the evening with six field goals
and a pair of free throws for a total
of 14 points. Rowe and Edman each
connected for two goals.

Captain Shipley led the Marquette
attack from a guard position, scoring
13 points, ziunmacli dropped in four
field goals and a free throw for nine
points,

Follaw Golden Ruli-

“Luther's creed found no relation
between salvation and the niccties of
religion. He would consign society
to the devil~where it promptly went
iyet follow the Golden Rule. Cal»
vinists were made of sterner stuff,
for they stood by their faith in dem-
mating the state and believed that
self diligence would automatically
produce the ideal society. The Pros
testants in general bclieved merely in
honest individuals to produce a good
society."

Niebuhr explained that there were
values in all of these approaches to
a perfect society, but the sects were
too small to have the responsibility
of such a large task.

“We must use our insight of the
gospel," he continued, “And our '
felligence and knowledge We must
make Christianity function relevant
to economic conditions, We must be
peace makers. We must understand
that social strife is due to conflict
between economic interests."

Nieb‘uhr Scores
Spencer’s Theory

“History must be written from a

perspective," said Reinhold Niebubi,
Gates lectllrel, bore Wednesday
night. “It is written from the per-
spective of the age in which the ob-
server livcs. \Vhet right have we to
say that a. Chicago business man is
happier than a Spanish peasant? It's
merely our viewpoint,"

Mr Niebulu- was speaking on “The
Decay of the Idea of Progress, and
the Christian Interpretation of His-
tory," and showed that the world to-
day, not being socially minded, was
not progressing. He scored the Chris—
tian chuich particularly for accept
ing Herbert Spencer’s philosophy of
evolution as extending into all forms
of human activity, reaching toward
the ultimate perfect man.

“New means of communication tend
toward intimacy and intimacy is hor-
rid where love is absent," he pointed
out. “Fessimism represents a purcr
spiritualism than optimism since op-
timism is the invasion of modern cul-
ture into the church."
