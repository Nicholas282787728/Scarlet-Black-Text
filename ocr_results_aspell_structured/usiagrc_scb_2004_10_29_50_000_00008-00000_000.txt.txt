On the right track

Founder J. B. Grinnell chose Grinnell’s location based on plans for rail
lines, and the tracks still run right through the center of local life

BY KIRSTEN AHO

What makes loud noises and is the
reason why Grinnell exists where it
does? The train.

Dorothy Pindor, one of the editors
of the Grimm/1 Herald—Register, tells
a story of a Sunday morning meet-
ing not long ago in the Forum South
Lounge, ”A train came through while
the speaker was talking, and he made a
comment about how he didn’t under-
stand why anyone would want a train
to run through the middle of their
campus,"shc said.

“1 went up to him after the meete
ing and told him the college wouldn't
be here ifthere were no trains running
through it."

According to Pindor, J. B. Grin-
nell wanted to start a town that was
economically viable. This location
was perfect: surveyors had marked it
as a spot trains would run through,
Grinnell bought the land surround~
ing the surveyor’s marks and reserved
space for the college, local schools and
churches.

in the past,thc rrain has functioned
to bring freight, mail and people to
and through Grinnell. Now, the train
brings only freight through Grlnnell.
The passenger scrvicc stepped back in
the early 1970s, during the Kent stare
Riot.

Because orthe overshadowing rm:
porlancc ofthc riot, most people were
not concerned with the loss ofpasscn-

ger services.

“The government made wonderful
roads," said Robin Braders, a mem-
ber of the Model Railroad Club. As
a result, there was little interest in the
passenger service offered by railroads.
Additionally, the auto industry could
employ more people, said David Jones,

”The college wouldn’t
be here if there were no
trains running through it."

anothcr mcmbcr of the club.

Some groups are actively pursuing
getting passenger service back again,
but the current condition of the rail—
roads makes this unlikely

The railroad mail service stopped
when Federal Express and other roads
based mail services became popular,
but the Railway Express Building in
Grinnell is still standing. This building
once served as the post ofﬁce for mail
and packages coming err rhe trains.
Located across the street from the for
mer train depot, now a restaurant, the
Railway Express building has become
the meeting place for the Model Rail-
road Club.

The Model Railroad Club ofﬁcial-
ly began about a year and a half ago,
The club has an arrangement with the
Mayﬂower Retirement Home, owne
ers of the Railway Express Building,
which also allows residents of the
home to take part in club activities.

The club also provides mntcri»
als and mcntors college students who
want to make miniature buildings.

The members of the club have
each built several of these buildings
for a rnodel train set, including models
ofthe Depot, the former Monroe Ho-
tel, the old spaulding factory and their
own houses,

They are building models on three
different scales, the HO scale, the O
Scale and the G scnlc,“tiying to make
it as eclectic as possible,"said Jones.
