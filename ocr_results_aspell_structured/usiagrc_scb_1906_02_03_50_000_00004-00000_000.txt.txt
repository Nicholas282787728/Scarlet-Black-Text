POINTED PARAGRAPHS.

No one likes a man who is elel'lilst-
ingly saying "Beg pal-don.H

The man iylio laihs to much, asa
rule, does not talk enough at. the
right time.

Two heads are beLLer than one, but
oneoinhcm lleillly always does the
business.

Most. men have the same experi-
ences. The only diilerencc is that
some men talk and some down.

When you are working very hard
take some oomiort in this: Those who
are idle don't. seem to behaving a very
good time.

We suppose news papers do annoy
their readers a good deal. still news
paper men, as a rule, do the best they
can, It is an annoying business.

The members or last year‘s senior
class ac Minnesota are planning Lo
ﬁght the suit brought, against them
by Byron so Willard, the printers or
the 1905 Gopher, who are endeavoring
to recover lihe 3820 still due them
from the publishers of the book.
