 

Friar Speaks On Poer Kozo‘nrzakis

Translator, critic, and poet
Kimon Friar spoke Tuesday
evening to a large crowd in
South Lounge. He lectured on
”Saviors of God,The Spiritual
Odyssey of Kikos Kazantzar
kis.” '

Friar is best known for his
English translation of Greek
author Kazantzakis’ greatest
work, ”The Odyssey, A Mode
ern Sequel.” In his lecture,
Friar told of his work and
relationship with Kazantzakis
while writing the translation.
Kazantzakis’ “Odyssey" is
three times longer than Home
er’s original and begins where
Homer’s ends, immediately
after Odysseus returns home
and kills Penelope's suitors.

Friar told his audience en-
ough of the new ”Odyssey's"
story to get at the essence of
Kazantzakis‘ thought andphil~
osophy. This essence, Friar
said, is thatman mustsuccese
sively go beyond the mind and
logic, beyond the heart, and
ultimately beyond the hope
arising from mindand heart to
"build in an ectasy of tragic
joy. " Man, after rE'aliZingthat
the abyss of hopelessness is
the lot of all men, must joys
fully struggle to build over
that abyss.

At the same time, Friar said,
each man must discover his

own uniqueness and theniden»
tify himself successively with
his racial origins, With all of
mankind, and finally with all
matter in the universe. Friar
noted that most men only 0C,
casionally feel this oneness
with the universe, as when
they feel that the pounding of
the sea, the pulsing of the
stars, and the beating of their
own heart are in one rhythm.

Friar continued to say that
Kazantzakis' notion of God is
a spiritual notion, "which it-
self is always struggling to
purity." This is not an al—
mighty or perfect God, but
one which is in constant dan-
ger and agony. This God cries
out to man for help, because
man is the nearest to God in
the present evolutionary
stage. Although man's actions
are doomed to be imperfect
incarnations of his visions,
Friar said, “01 the whole, it
is man who must help save
God.”

Kazantzakis’ theme, borh in
his ”Odyssey” and in ”The
Saviors of God," Friar said,
is that "The essence of God
is the struggle to find free
dom and salvation; to free
ourselves from hope thatfree-
dom and salvation exist; and
to accept this with joy .. .The
greatest virtue is not to be
free, but to struggle for free-

dom."

Friar touched on other
themes in Kazantzakis’ work,
most prominent of which was
revolution against oppression.
Odysseus, set forth on his
second set of travels, helps
lead an unsuccessful rebels
lion in Egypt against the pha-
roah and priests who exploit
and repress theirpeople. Frir
ar's emphasis, however, re-
mained upon Kazantzakis’ own
philosophy.

Near the conclusion of his
lecture, Friar noted the pop
ularity which Kazantzakis' ph-
ilosophy is enjoying among
college students. He said that
this philosophy like existent
ialism, says that all life is
absurdity; but Kazantzakis,
unlike the existentialist finds
joy in the struggle which man
wages in spite of his hope-
lessness.

At the end of his lecture,
Friar asked the large atten-
tive crowd for questions; and
for once, Grinnell students
although obviously impressed,
found themselves unable to
question the speaker. Friar
suggested that he teach the
audience some Greek dances,
which he claimed is what Ka-
zantzakis would do when there
was nothing to say. Sound
equipment not beingavailable,
the crowd drifted away.

Antiwar Groups Unite

Spring anti-war activities
are beginning to mushroom at
Grinnell, in Iowa and across
the country as the weather
clears and the war goes on.

All Grirmell and Iowa activi<
ties will take place around the
Spring Action Calendar which
was formulated by the Peo-
ple’s Coalition For Peace and
Justice. This is an amalgam
of most U.S. peace groupswh‘
ich united to tie the issues of
peace, justice and Welfare.
The other, onerissue groups
then formed National Peace
Action Coalition to fight just
the Vietnam War.

The People's Coalition is
active this weekend on the
theme: "Freedom from Hune
ger, War and Oppression."
Other groupsactive thisweek~
end include the Southern Ch-
ristian Leadership Confer'
ence and the National Welfare
Rights Organization.

At Grinnell this is Black
Martyr's Weekend (see the
article on page four by Lawr
rence Wright).

A Conference on Social Ch~
ange is takingplacethisweeke
end at Wartburg College in
Waverly. Eric Craft and
Benjie Katz will represent
Grinnell‘s SpringAction Com-
mittee at the conference.

Speakers will include John
Froines, Rick Mthearson,
and Dan Mchrry. Topics will
include the liberation move
ments, black issues, Amer-
ioan imperialism, springactir
vitles and training for non-

violent action.

The People‘s Peace Treaty
is the most important antir
war event on the Grinnell
campus now. The Grinnell
SAC has represenmtives on
every floor showing the treaty
to people. Eventually, most
students hopefully will have
signed the treaty.

SAC is also working now to
sign people up to bus to Wash
ington. The Senate will pro-
vide $600 if there is enough
interest. The cost per person
is less than $26. HopEfully,
some will pay moreand others
will donate money so that some
can go who cannot afford the
full fare.

SAC will have an open meet-
ing at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in
Gardner Lounge to further its
plans. SAC is an open student
organization; everyone is
welcome, and help is needed.

Eqbal Ahmed of the Kissin-
ger Conspiracy will speak
here April 13 or 14, and Igal
Roodenko of the War Resis-
ters League will be here April
22. SAC is planning anall-day
Festival of Life for the 22nd
with bands and speakers, to
be climaxed by Roodenko’s
speech in Roberts Theater.

Antiewar author BanningGae
rrett will also speak here, but
the date is unknown.

As of now, no plans are being
made locally for April 24; but
developments are anticipated.
