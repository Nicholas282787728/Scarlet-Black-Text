Community braves the weather to fi

BvAI I SARGENT

While many Grinncll College students
were pampering tor waltz last Saturday,
around 300 members of the Grinnell town
and campus community braved the winds
[or a walk at Ahrens Park. The walkers were
participants in the 121] annual Poweshiek
county Relay for Life, a teamsbased walking
marathon in which one member ofcach team
must be walking on the track at all times for six
hours. During the fiscal year, the event raised
a grand total of 107,151 dollars to benefit the
American Cancer Society.

The event began at noon on Saturday with
a birthday party themed celebration to core
respond with the American Cancer Society’s
slogan, “The official sponsor of Birthdays."
After an afternoon of bouncy castles, face-
painting and carnival games, the relay began at
6 pm. and continued until midnight, although
some participants stayed on through the night
to hold an overnight vigil. The timing of the
event was meant to symbolize hope and life,
die participants making it through the night
to the dawning of a new day.

Small team tents were spread around the
footpath near the park shelter, where people
could bid in a silent auction, as well as purchase
t-shirts, food, snacks and luminaries, with all
proceeds beneﬁting the American cancer so-
ciety. Adding to the close community feel of
the event were performances by wrious local
and school'sponsored music and dance groups.

Poweshiek County’s Relay for Life is part
of a nationwide event called Relay for Life.
The County’s Relay used to take place in Sep
tember but the organizers decided to move it
permanently to May in the hopes of more sun-
shine—and more Grinnell College students.

“Grinnell College is such a staple of the
community [and] we'd really like to get you
guys out here," said Nicole Mohler, an associs
ate of community relations for the American
Cancer Society.

This year, the event definitely did—one of
the eight participating teams was comprised

of Grinnell College volleyball and girls socs
cer players The colleges sports teams were
encouraged by SAACD (Student Athlete Ad»
visory Committee) to participate in the event.
“It’s nice to represent the college in a good way
in the community." said Liz Davis ’11. volley
ball team captain.

In order to raise money the teams held a
bake sale and a rafﬂe, in addition to creating
an online registry for friends and family to
donate, “We appreciate every dollar that we’ve
gotten from students,faculty. friends and fame
ily," Davis said.

Participants, the volleyball and soccer
teams among them, managed to keep warm
despite the harsh conditions by talking and
braiding friendship bracelets, “Even though
it's cold we’re trying to do our part by walks
ing," Davis said.

Team members certainly had no lack of
motivation. “There's some good people at our
country who had cancer, lost the fight," said
Sharon Mealey, eaptain of the Iowa Telecorn
relay team. “We just wanted to try and honor
them."

For some teams this compassion was also
mixed with passion for competition. “We like
to come out here and see how we've done
compared to the other teams," Mealey said.
“We never win though."

Organizers noted that the cold weather
and conﬂicting eventsisuch as Waltz, high
school proms and even other fundraisersi
may have led to a slightly lower turnout than
expected. “We still had a good turnout on it
in the end,"said Elisa Bardole, event co-chaitr
“We knew weather would play a factor."

For next year’s Relay, Mohler, Bardole
and fellow coschair Sherry Thompson hope
for clear skies. warm temperatures and lots of
participation—something that the Grinnell
College community can deﬁnitely help out
With.“College kids' enthusiasm is contagious,"
Thompson said “The college kids we've got
here arejust terrific."

Though the event takes a lot of work to or

 

Memom was ooliry/samempvreﬁn a plain: Rlﬂbrenl Pot/z '

ganize each year, with all of the planning and
fundraising. the work is nothing compared to
the payoff, according to Mohler,

"It's very motivating and makes everything
worth it when you get here and see the survi-
vors,”Mohler said.

Both Mohler and Bardole emphasized
that honoring and supporting survivors is the
main focus of the event, citing the American
Cancer Society’s phrase that they are “u toms
inunity taking up the right."

"It's about them. The money is secondary,"
Bardole said.

With the event, organizers also hope to
get more people involved in raising commu-
nity awareness. In particular, organizers hope
to get the word out about support services for
those undergoing treatment, such as the Hope
Lodge in Iowa City, which offers free housing

to those undergoing treatment and live too far
to commute. Mohler feels especially positive
about the patient Helpline. “Cancer patients
can call at 3:30 in the morning and there will
be a live person who will answer,” Mohler said.

The untorninate reality is that cancer has
become a subject that most people can relate
to, especially in Iowa.

“Everyone gets it in some my or another,"
Bardole said, The search for treatments and
cures for all forms of cancer are more pett'r
nent than ever to Iowans, since this year, can
cer replaced heart disease as the leading cause
of death in Iowa.

Mohler emphasized the role that aware-
ness plays in noticing cancer before it worsens
and spreads. “Early detection really saves Lives,"
Mohler said, “You have to get past the fear of
it."
