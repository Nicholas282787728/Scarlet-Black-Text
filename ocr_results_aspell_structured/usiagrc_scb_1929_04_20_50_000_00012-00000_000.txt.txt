THE GRINNELL SCARLFII‘ AND BLACK

Harrington Calls “Grinnell Spirit”

Prominent All Over United States

Altirniing that during hi travels
he had heard the phrase “Grilmell
Spirit," pronounced in ttie remotest
parts oi the United states, nir. Hor-
rington went on to say, ”It's like this;
it the football team or track team is
going on a trip, there is sure to he
a crowd of motors 'dt the depot to
see them oil, and it makes the team
feel like winning. But if they lose,
the students just pat them on the
back and show them that they're with
them just the some,"

Mr. Harrington is known to all col-
lege students and usually is among
the first to greet them wtien they
step from the train at Griunell, He
may he found either at the depot or
the post office loading and unload-
ing mail sacks.

Born in Grlnnell, hir, Harrngton
has been active in the monster busi-
ness for twenty-nine years. He has
held ions in many parts of the counr
try, hence his many interesting In-
cidents which he can tell: In 1915 he
served In the army on the Mexican
border and then went to Camp Dem—
ing as the United States entered the
world war. He remained in the army
until 1320 and then returned to his
hiisiness in Grinnell.

In regard to prepping. Mr. Har-
rington said, "Prepping is all right.
There has to he an outlet somewhere
for excess steam and i think that is
one oi the best ways." Over-prepping
seemed to him to he an unavoidable
evil. He believes prepping helps
college spirit.

"There used to be some real ‘knock~
down' freshman-sophomore class
scraps. one year some sophomores
tried to get away in a hay wagon, hut
were caught when they tried to es
cape after the horse had hroken its
harness. Another time the sophs
draped a wagon like a hearse, I re-
member that one year nine or ten
sophomores were tied up in their
rooming house on Elm street betore
they could get away."

Not Print Untrue Displays;

\Vr'lshington, D. 0,. April 26, (Sheer
inl).—0bviollsly fraudulent and untrue
advertising will no longer appear in
magazines published by one of the
lending chitin of periodicals in a
country, it was announced today by
the Federal Trade commission, The
company agreed to no longer print
such advertising :ifLer being advised
by the commission that publishing of
further ads of that kind would bring
legal action from the commission

The commission Was acting under
an agreement made between the
periodicals or the United States lastl
tall.

 

alleged vaporizer was said to "more
than douhlc gasoline mileage!”

Another advertisement oiicred
"amazing proﬁts" in a short time

An alleged treatment for “Blood
Diseases", was described as tollows:
“No matter how had or old the case.
or what's the cause," “Treatment was
used successlully for over twenty-ﬁve
years in the most severe and chronic
cases."

“What made my hair grow?" asked a
headline on another display. “Two
years ago I was hald all over the top
of my head, I tried ditterent preparrv
tions but they did no good, I remain-
ed hald until i used it v it. New

 

control chapter."

In other advertisements were mi5r
celhiiieous captions and texts such as.

“Are you afraid to love? Does a net
ting pni-ty stop with a kiss or does it
go further? is spooning dangerous?
At 1 -t the question is answered.”

“Ha- true love come into your “[97
or didn‘t your recognize it when it
came? Are you ntraid now oi the hat-
rliiig, perp xiiig mysteries cl sex re—
lationship? Are you discontented with
tho stupid lies and turtive, ashamed
answers the world gives you in place
of the naked, tenrless truth you tler
sire? Do you want some safe, sane.
unashanied advice on sex questions?

The commission Iound all the ad-
vertisements complained of to be
fraudulent, and many suggestive, and
indecent.

The company, in signing the stiplllar
lion, agreed that if it ever resumed
or indulged in any of the practices
in question, the stipulation as to the
facts as made by the commission may
he used in evidence against it in the

trial of the complaint whlch the com-
mission may issue.
