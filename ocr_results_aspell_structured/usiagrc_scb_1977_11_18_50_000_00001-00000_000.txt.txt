. College has $5.6 million in S. African stocks

By Julie Brand

The college‘s investment portfolio ,
released early this week revealed that ol
the nearly $30 million worth of stocks and
bonds the college owns. 19 per cent is in
companies tied to the Union of South
Africa.

Grinnell currently owns $23,671,214
worth of stocks and bonds. of this total,
$5,671,214 is invested in corporations with
economic ties to South Africa.

OF THE 51 corporations originally
questioned by Jim Stuart, one of
the students who initiated the inquiries
into college holdings in South African-tied
corporations, 17 appear on the list of the
151 different corporations in which the
college has invated. , _

Next to Grinnell Communicatl ns_
Corp, Ford Motor Company is the
college’s - ' largat holding, with
$4,168,635 in stocks and bonds. The rest of
the holdings in companies economically
involved in South Africa are (in order of
college investment size): U.S. Steel

Corporation; Chrysler Financial Corp;
International Telephone and Telegraph;
Texaco; Citicorp; Atlantic Richfield;
General Electric; Eastman Kodak;
Bethelem Steel; Pfizer, Inc.; Sperry
Rand, Inc.; Caterpillar Tractor; Exxon
Corp; Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.;
Mobil Corp; Merrill Lynch. Pierce
Fenner 8: Smith; and Bank America
corporation.

m A recent report in the Chicago Sun-
'rinies. corporations that compose 75 per
centof the total U.S. assets in South Africa
were named. Of these thirteen, Grinnell
owns stock in eight of them, comprising 82
per cent of the college's $5.6 million South
Africanetied investments.

Turner had commented earlier that
although the college has extensive in-
vestment in Ford. such investment is not
necessarily irresponsible because Ford
has established enlightened racial
policies.

"BEFORE THIS issue was raised, I
investigated the Ford Motor Company in

South Africa in terms of its practices. And
its practices appear to be very good. It’s
joined with 11 other major companies who
all have similar arrangements of non-
segregatlon, equal pay for equal work,
training programs, replacement of retired
high»positioned Whites by blacks, housing
programs and all that." he said.

The release of the portfolio by the
trustees was largely Hie result of an effort
that was begun nine weeks ago by students
for a responsible investment policy, Three
weeks later, the SGA released a statement
urging the trustees to not only release the
portfolio, but to distribute a Statement
to the campus community conceming the
college’s support for an end to the apar-
theid system of segregation in the Union of
South Africa. Stockholders resolutions
were also requested mandating both
immediate corporate compliance with
United Nations economic sanctions and
withdrawal of businesses from South
Africa.

IN ADDITION to this, a policy was

urged for careful consxderatlon of future
investment decisions. After much
discussion and four weeks, SGA approved
a call for divestiture of stock in companies
which failed to act on the resolutions alter
two years.

SGA President .Iori Neiderbach was “not
really surprised that they released the
portfolio. Most schools. especially large
universities, make their investments
public. But (the release of the portfolio) is
useful because now we know where to
focus our efforts in order to press for ef-

' fective action."

STUART WAS not surprised by the
portlollo contents. Turner mentioned the
Ford Motor Company investment to
smart in a meeting with him two months
ago. ”There’s quite a bit of stock out in
Ford Motor Company, but $4 million is
definitely a significant amount of stock
which can be used influentially,” Stuart
said. The high level of investment did not
discourage Stuart. “1 still want proxy
votes made. and I still intend to promote

divestiture,’I he

said.

Barrett resigns from Vice-Provost position

By Bob Mitchell .

William Barrett, who became
college Vice-Provost on July 1 of
this year, has raigned his position,
citing personal reasons and a
misinterpretation of what his job
would entail. ,

Barrett officially notified the
administration of his decision
November a. He subsequently
notified both President Turner and
Dean Waldo S. Walker personally,
and later informed Walker of his
decision by letter. He will leave the
campus no later than. February 1.

In Focus

AS Vice-Provost. Barrett works
under Walker. He has respon-
sibility for faculty and curricular
concerns, budget planning and
procedures, and maintenance of
physical plant and campus ser-
vices. His particular areas of
concern are budget preparation,
expenditure control, personnel
procedures, and direct oversight of
plant and service units. He is also
currently the Affirmative Action
officer of the college.

In explaining his decision,
Barrett Cited the fact that when he

applied for the position of Vice
Provost he told the interviewing
committee that he had two career
objectives: becoming the
president of a college and owning
and publishing a newspaper.
Conceding that he planned on
staying longer when he first took
the job, he said his experience at
Grinnell prompted him to explore
publishing as a career. It led him to
conclude that being Vice-Provost
here is not “the place for me to be
right now.”

"THE DECISION I have arrived

at. . . is that what I really want to
do . . . is to focus on the second of
my objectives,” he said.

Barrett felt his decision is part of
a process of selfdiscovery. After
living in Grinnell. he said. both he
and his Wife decided the mid-
western lifestyle was not for them,
and that they prefer living in an
urban environment on either the
east or west coast. He also em-
phasized that this decision should
not be viewed as a condemnation of
the midwest.

BARRETT also admitted that he

per capita consumption will
require a doubling of food
production in the next mirty years.

POPULATION is a central
problem of today‘s food situation.
Rapid population growth
historically has been particularly
acute in poorer countries of the
World. Foreign Policy No. 13 states
“Fully four-fifths of the annual
increment in world population, of
an estimated 70 million, occurs in
the poor countries,"

The problems ui high population
and a poor economy are closely
tied to that of consumption. The
poorer countries, as a result of low
income level and growing
population, can afford to consume
but minimal commodities. The
consumption gap between the poor,
lower income nations and the
wealthier nations is widening.

THE GAP in consumption levels
is large dlleto nlai'ketconditiolis.
in a market cconomy the poor and
most needy nations suffer sllbr
stantiillly in the face of sudden and
frequent shifts in price levels.

in times of lood shortages and
high food prices the poorer nations
srmply cannot afford to pay the
going rates. This problem of
acquisition is reflected in the diets
of the people in the poorer nations.
They are forced to survive at less
than subsistence levels.

was not happy with his job as Vice
Provost and that this unhappiness
was another factor in his decision.

“I did expect to operate with
more authority and greater scope,
but the fault is in my interpretation
of the college’s needs and not in the
college’s articulation of those
needs,” he said.

WHEN asked to define what he
meant by operating with “more
authority and greater scope,”
Barrett explained that he came
from an environment where he was
“head honcho." He had hoped
to assume a similar position here,
but he learned that “the reality of ,
college life” does not allow (or such
a role.

The Vice-Provost denied
strongly that internal bickering
between him, President Turner
and Dean Walker had anything to
do with his departure.

“THIS isn’t a story about
Grinnell, President Turner, and
Dean Walker in any way. it people
are reading dissension into this . . .
that’s not true. The story’s not
about them, it’s about Bill
iBarrett," he said.

Walker regretted Barrett's
resignation.

“BILL Barrett is an excellent
administrator and a person of
demonstrated abilities and in-
tegrity. We are sorry that he has
decided to leave education, but we
are sure that in his new pursuits he
will receive the same great respect
that be has already earned as a
school and college official," he
Said.

Prior to working as Vicerrovost
here, Barrett was [he chief ad-
llilnistrativf and financial officer
at GillrSl Bernard, Where he had
responsibility for all non-academic
services

ll\' 197171972. he served as clerk
of and staff officer to a joint
committee of the boards of Gill and
St. Bernard's, and directed the
merger of the two schools in the
spring of 1972.

He was also a cofounder of the
School Consortium of New Jersey
whose membership includes ten
public and private schools, three
corporations, and a university. ‘
