Stephen Speronis Comments on Recent Changes
In Struggle For Power ln Communist Politburo

(Edior’s Note: Speronis, an
assistant professor of history,
specializes in Russian and So»
viet Affairs.)

The recent changes in the
composition of the Politburo
reflect a continuing struggle
for power among the top-
runking members of the
Collin unist Party. On March
9a 19 three men appeared
as the epigoni (successors) of
Stalin. These were Georgi Mair
enkov, Lavrenti Reno, and Vyas
cheslav Molotov, Oi the three
only Molotov has succeeded in
retaining his leading position.

Beria was liquidated and Mal-
enlmv who for a time took
over supreme control of the
country has been relegated to
number ten in the Communist
Party leadership. A relative una
knew“, Nikita iKi‘ushcheV as-
sumed control of the Party mas
chinei‘y and appointed Nikolai
Bulganin as premier.

Krushchev's push to power
began in 1954 when he launclr
ed a program of appointing his
henchmen to lesser administra—
tive posts in the Agriculture de-
partment. He worked assiduous-
ly and well, however, and by
1955 had successfully under-
mined the program of Georgi
Malenkov. The psychology of
fear among the members of thc
Politburo is thus again plainly
evident. Krushchev apparently
did not have sufficient backing
to completely remove Malenkov
nor to avoid calling Marshall
Zhukov to the top policy~making
body of the Soviet Union.

Zhukov is the man to watch.
He is the first proiessional sol-
dier ever to gain prominence
in the Council oi Ministers.

chev, Bulganin, and Zhukov
not only shows the rise to
prominence for the iirst time
since 1917 oi the real army
generals but also the introduc—
tion oi a nonel’ai'ty group in
the top ranks of the Russian
Government. Whether Zhukov

forced his way in or whether
Krushchev's colleagues eiiect.
ed this as a check on Krush-

cIiUv’s power is an open ques
tion,

We do know. however, that
Krushchcv‘s policies in the Uk—
raine and in Kazakhstan have
failed. The weakest element in
the Soviet economic structure
has always been agriculture,
and since this afieots the over
whelming majority of Russians,
the problems of collcctivizatrcn
and production figure prominr
ently in determining the actions
oi the Politburo,

The Soviet Union is made up
of a variety of races, religions
and languages. There are over
one hundred languages spoken
at the present time in the So-
viet Union. Ever since 1924 the
Great Russians have assumed
an attitude of superiority over
thc other people or the Soviet
Empire

The Great Russians have
not relinquished this hold over
the Soviet people, and there
is no indication that they in-
tend doing so. Further evi-
deuce or this iact is shown by
tho appointment oi ten new
generals by Marshall Zhukov,
all of whom are Great Russ<
inns.

Zhukov, Krushchev and Bui-
ganin make an uneasy troika or
triumvirate. To this observer.
the fact that Krushchev placed
Bulganin in the Premiership del—
initely points to a desire on
Krushchev’s part tor a closer
liason between Army and
Party. It is doubtful that this
was a voluntary concession to
the Army by Krushchev.

More and more, Zhukov has
risen into prominence. even to
the extent of granting inter-
views to visiting journalists,
Zhukov is therefore not only
prominent, but is now claiming
his share of the victories over

Germany. He has thus given the‘
lie to both Stalin and Krushe.

chcv, and for the inst time in
Russia, a true picture of World
War 2 is being given to the
Russian people.

Zhukov‘s claim is thereioro
a direct challenge to the
party politicians who have al—
ways taken credit ior Russian
successes. In any event, the
struggle ior power is no long—
er exclusively within the
Communist Party. A new
force has entered the Arena.
This iorce. symbolized by Zhu~
kov, is that oi the Russian
spirit pure and simple, and in
a fight between Krushchev
and Zhukov, the latter would
emerge victorious His pres-
tige and the primary loyalty
given him by his fellow oil-i.
cers and men could very pos-
sibly be the precursor to a

drastic change in the governs
mont or the Soviet Union.

No dictatorship and particu-
larlv that of the Kremlin can
long endure indeiinite frustra»
tion of its announced goals. One
way or another, the Russian cit-
izen is going to be heard. The
adjustment may he swift and
surc as in the case oi Beria and
the Sccret Police, or it may take
a more violent turn as was the
case in 1917. Whatever the out-
come, the clash is inevitable,
and as the cpigoni of Stalin con-
tinue their own civil war, the
ircc world is given more time
to increase its strength and se-
curity. The recent news from
Moscow is indeed most refresh-
ing.

"United States policy in
Southeast Asia is to check
Communist expansion and to
aid in building strong, stable,
and independent governments
throughout the area," Dr.
James Bell of the U. S. State
Dept. stated.

”The most important fact to
recognize in the area is the drive
toward nationalism and self—de-
terminism," he declared. Most of
the countries had a colonial
status before the war, and have
only recently become indepen-
dent Their desire to hold on to
this freedom and to strengthen
themselves is very strong.”

It is natural that these nations
should be suspicrous of western
colonial nations and their allies,
Bell explained, Since they have
had no expel
munist imperialism they are not
as concelned about it.

The leaders of the area, how—
ever, are Coming to realize that
the U. S, is anti-colonial, he as-
serted. “We are and should cons

Fullfillment of a century’s
dream of freedom, and deep

lnralty of the United States
Clialrctel'lzed the speech of
Philippine minister Paul T.
Leutario. Before speaking,
Leutario showed a film prodno
ed by the Phillipine’s Junior
Chamber of Commerce. which
depicted the education and pro-
duction progress of the islands.

Leutario stated that the re-
ceding influence of the West is
producing a near crucial situa-
tlon in the Far East. However,
he cited the deep respect of the
Phillipine government towards
the United States as a partial
balance for this recession,

A mutual defense plan was
cited as an example or the
stronger relations with the U. s.

their indcpcndence The governs
ment’s agreement with President
Eisenhower's statement of For-
mosan policy was another ex-

However, Leutario stated that
rule problem which accured after
the islands' independence was
economy and trade, Before in
dependence. the islands were
geared to iree trade with the
U. 5, But now, restrictions have
been placed on Phillipine im-
ports into the U. 5. Calling for
investment of foreign capital
into the Phillipine industry,
Lcuterio felt that this would re.
lieve some of the problems of
the lack of money in Southeast
Asia.

Leutario stated that the re
ligiou and culture of the Phil-
lipines may be an avenue for
bringing the East and West clos—
er together for a better under-
standing among peoples oi the
world.
