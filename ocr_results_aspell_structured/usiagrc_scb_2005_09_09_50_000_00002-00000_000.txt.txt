For Eric Otoo ’01, going back to
school has made for an incredible week.
The Grinncll alum, one of 76 recipients
of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation
scholarships,jiist began his ﬁrst classes
at Harvard Business School.

“This is one of those instances
where you think someone in admissions
has made a mistake!" he said, laughing.
“This is an amazing group of people,
and no day is predictable."

The foundation, which takes its
name from the late owner ofthe Wash»
ington Redskins football team, distrihe
utes scholarships for graduate sntdy
on the basis of academic achievement
and ﬁnancial need as well as leadership,
community involvement and a will to
succeedThc graduate scholarship pro
vides up to 350,000 per year for up to
6 years.

Otoo lived in Ghana until coming
to the United States to attend Grinnell
in 1998. While at Grinnell, he double

majored in economics and computer

science. He said that his undergraduate
years were "fulﬁlling and remrding,"
and that "you really got out of them
what you put in.”

Since graduating, Otoo has spent

two years working as an actuary for
Towers Pcrnn, a Chicago consulting
ﬁrm, and two years in Los Angelcs with
the economic and technology consultr
lug ﬁrm Analysis Group, Inc. doing ﬁ-
nancial and economic consulting.

Otoo is interested in working with
privatized companies in Ghana to help
them become 'more eFficient. Harvard,
he hopes, will be a place to gain the
understanding and experience he will
need to return to Ghana and start a
ﬁnancial consultation firm that will
“make the dream [ofhigher living stan»
dards] a reality.”

In Ghana, roughly 40 percent ofthe
economy is comprised of subsistence
farming.

In the long term, Otoo has not ruled
Out seeking public ofﬁce, in the ﬁnance
ministry or even the presidency.

"[ln Ghana],with the development
sector it is a matter ofright implement
tation of ﬁscal and monetary policy
that will create a conducive environ-
ment for business to improve."

Nathalie Lauze ’06 now in charge

Plans, Cant. from p. 1

Laiu said from the beginning that
he did not want to keep control of
Plans. on August 19, he appointed
Nathalie Lauze ’06 as the new adminis-
trator. Lauze said that Laiu mentioned
that possibility to her when it became

apparent that the criteria for the elec-
tion would not be met, Lauze and Laiu
are good friends. “Sechyi has a tenden-
cy to let me be on the inside ofhis latest
schemes," said Lauze,

Lauze now manages the email not
count and creates new Plans. Since
Lauze is not an expert in programming,

she enlists other people’s help to handle
the coding and technical aspects of
Plans administration, She refused to
disclose their names. “Being in league
with Sechyi can get you in alot oftrou-
ble," she said. Lauze will graduate this
year and is looking for a current student
for the job of Plans administrator.
