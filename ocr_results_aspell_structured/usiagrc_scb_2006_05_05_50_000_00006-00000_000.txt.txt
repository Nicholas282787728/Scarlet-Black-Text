Students propose new activist center

"The Voicebox” would provide activists with a central meeting place and organizing resources

BY DAVID MONTGOMERY

“The Voicebox" got 17 votes and “Activist Re-
source Center" got 12, but the voters might use them
both, These activists propensity to be inclusive and
nonehierarchical has made finalizing details a long
process. ‘

The activist center. slated to be in the Joe Rosen-
ﬁeld '25 Campus Center, is intended to provide re
sources and a central meeting space for activist groups
and individuals The impetus
for the center came from several

the process nonehierarchical with wanting to have the
center ready by next semester.

“I think it’s inevitable [With] as democratic as
we’re trying keep it, when a lot of people are getting
together and trying to make decisions [that] it's a slow
process with lots of discussion and opinions," Emily
Reiersgaard ’08 said. “Sometimes it's frustrating, but
I‘m really impressed with how quickly everything has
moved along and taken shape."

Vice President for Student Afr
fairs Tom Ciady suggested a small

students discussing the idea at a
meeting for a different group.
Latona Giwa ’09 said that
from the beginning, they didn’t
want any one person or group
in control. “We decided right off
that it needed to be a very col-
laborative, collective non-hierar-
chical recess," said Giwa. “Sure,
Linn Davis '08] and I could

a system of people that are willing
to dedicate themselves and are able
to support oath other in something
other than school, something much
more Important than arademl‘tl.”

”l hope that thls renter will pruwde

meeting room on the third ﬂoor of
the campus center. The proposed
space will be furnished with a copy
machine, computer and printer.
Funding for the activist center
is not yet established. Reiersgaard,
who is heading up the funding
subscommittee, said that they are
looking to President Russell K.
Osgood, Crady and an SGA roll-

write a proposal that week, but
that would be distracting from the idea and purpose
of the center that we wanted to create"

Giwa and Davis met with individual students and
faculty on campus, trying to gauge interest. When
many people responded positively, they held two open
meetings to solicit ideas. A group of interested stu-
dents emerged, and four subrcommittees have been
formed to hammer out details: funding, location,
structure and networking

Students have had to balance their desire to keep

over account made public at the
beginning the semester.

“were kind or expecting support from the ad—
ministration because it’s such a selling point for this
campus," Reicrsgaard said. "We're not going to get
much support from them initially but hopefully in
the future they’ll see the great things we’re doing and
they'll want to be a part otit and fund us."

Students plan to maintain a library of activist
reading material, such as boycott manuals, as well as
student and media contact lists.They hope the space

will help people coordinate and organize action, even
if there is not an established group on campus for
their cause.

“Hopefully, the center will be a working space that
anyone can go to in order to find support for their
activism,"Dayna Hamann'o9 said,"An activist center
on campus is important in order to bridge the gap
ofcornmunicntion between individuals and organiza
tions who are trying to organize."

Other ideas for the center include an activist
newsletter, trainings and networking with Grinnell
community members, alumni and students at other
Iowa schools.

“I deﬁnitely see the center having the potential to
become something that lets people all over our region
cooperate about activism,” Adam Barrett '08 said. “I
also think that it might serve as a prototype for other
schools interested in having a way to keep their active
ists coordinated."

Reiersgaard sees the activist center as something
to help busy Grinneil students get involved more ease
i1y.“it's really hard on this campus to dedicate youre
selfto something other than schoolwork," she said. “I
hope that this center will provide a system orpeople
that are willing to dedicate themselves and are able to
support each other in . something much more ims
portant than academic ’

Students are meeting with Crady on Monday to
ﬁnalize the center’s location. The proposal for the
ccntcr can be viewed at http://mottepodtertiamn/
