Grinnell’s Magical Mystery Tour

NEWS ITEM: Wanted: A small but
signiiicant hard rock/heavy metal
band to play in an antique. acoustically
deiective gymnasium at a small but
signiiicant college located in the corn-
lields oi lowa.

This brief item may or may not have
appeared in the latest issue ol Rolling
Stone magazine but it suggests that the
rock scene at Grinnell is muSlcaiiy un»
sound. After spending a semester in
London and partaking oi such musical
delights as UFO, AC/DC and Yes I find
myseli at Grinnell, a place silent but for
a few pseudo~intellectual jazz concerts,
iake rock groups and an overabunr
dance oi iolk singers.

Although one is a small campus one
would expect to find a proliferation of
musical taste. But at Grinnell there ap»
pears to he a non-proliieration ol rock.
Did Amy Carter whisper to Jimmy C.
"nuclear non-proliferation ' and to
those in charge of concerts "non-
proliferation of rock?"

Before, however, this article ls
categorized as the product of a Grateful
Dead mind I want to explain that I do
understand the difficulties involved
when attempting to get rock groups on
campus i realize that little money is
available to get the big groups due to
the cost of sound, the state oi the
economy, lighting problems, the state
of the economy, transportation and the
state oi the economy. Nevertheless,
why won't the KLYF—listening ‘
dividuals in charge thoughtiully con»
sider increasing the activities lee? l do
not think there would be a mass protest

on Park Street it money ior entertain-
ment was requested And the increase
compared to all other increases might
turn out to be negligible ii the ad-
ministration believes it unfair to raise
everyone's lee ior concerts \thy not
legally add ii provision which would
allow the college to charge students lcr
concert tickets'.Y

Those of us who wake up with a Rush
and say goodnight to The Boss cannot
go through semesters with occasional
concessions made such as haying the
Ramones, Police and Springsteen,
years ago, on campus. i believe that lile
needs tabasco sauce every once in a
while in the form of All/DC to keep the
brain cells from stagnating into a
"Perry" Como state In order to
remedy this situation 1 suggest that
some Hard Rock at notable stature lI
will settle ior something besides The
who . i be cayoled. begged, given
anything leven Burllng Libr' yr in
order that they play Darby instead oi
the Hilton Coliseum.

ii tickets were sold to a mayor concert
they would probably cost less than the
almost $18 price ior Bruce Springsteen
tickets charged at Grinnell since many
fans went to Ames to hear the Boss 3
concert oi equivalent stature on came
pus should draw wide support.

Although it will be difficult to find the
band that wants to "get down i in Darby
there must be a group that would enjoy
music under basketball nets! And a
Darby concert. not North Lounge mlnlr
boogie, would be worth writing to Roll-
ing Stone!

My ideal vision for a night 01 rock

Marilyn Clark

begins Viith the select group accepting
to come tor a large amount ol money
Realizing that there is little ol this
precious commodity around, i suggest
that tickets be sold to real rockers,
partrtime boogie bouncers, assorted
proiessors, Biro workers and anyone
who gets bored spending an evening
with a sitar. The band could be given
special treatment by college relations,
i.e., an honorary degree, trusteeshlp.
and a new dorm named in their honor...
wouldn't you love to return to Grinnell
in ten years and hear someone say they
live in in: o. Speedwagon‘.’ Finally,
the group could give a lecture in Her»
rick as part at the Ted Nugent Series on
International Rock Allalrs. Overall, the
idea oi 1,200 students rocking in Darby
may not be to the liking oi all but ll
would be a Magical Mystery Tour ot
sorts

in conclusion, I am not suggesting
that KDIC be turned ovei‘ to an all rock
iormat, that the library have Slxspack
music specials between 10 pm and 2
am. on weekdays, that Mears be cone
verted into a recording studio but that
an effort be made to get mayor hard
rock talent on this campus,

For those w ho still preier to place cot»
ion in their ears rather than subject
themselves to this kind oi Concert, i
recommend two hours of mental doo -
mg with this ldeu and Ph) sical Gi'alli .
