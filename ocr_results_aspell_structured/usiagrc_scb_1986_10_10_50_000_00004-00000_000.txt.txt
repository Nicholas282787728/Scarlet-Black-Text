“Applying to College? Dread ure Ap-
plication Process? This Book Can Help."
So claims the back cover of Essays That
Worked, a compilation of “so Essays irom
Successful Applications to the Nation's
Top Colleges,” The essays contained
within (including three which were ac-
cepted by Grinnell) are, for the most part,
good, It cannot be denied that they “work
ed," by gaining letters of acceptance for
meir authors at the colleges to which they
were sent The question remains. though,
“Can this book help?”

In addition to the essays themselves. this
book contains admissions officers' com-
ments on these writings, and some stanr
dard essay hints (e.g re-read your essay,
use a dictionary, check the grammar).
The admissions otticers' comments about
the essays are ure most helplul parts of the
text; by reading them in conjunction with
the essays, one can get a feel for how the
essay nright be read. Be aware, though.
that these come from several different ads
missions officers and that the editors
themselves feel free to present their own
(often Conﬂicting) views in the same con-
text.

The question 01 whether to write a
“clever" essay is never resolved by the
editors: but, it needs to be because so
many of the examples are “Clever”
essays, Admissions ofﬁcers caution that
this type of essay is risky; yet, one gets me
feeling from reading all of the book’s
“clever" examples that this type is a
necessity.

Also unresolved is the question of
whether to louow a given essay question's
directions, Several essays are praised for
dodging the question they are supposed to
answer. “Make sure you answer the ques-
tion aDDronriatelv."_ cautions the book at
one point. while it comments at anourer.
“She is breaking the rules, but who
cares?” The editors give Hie impression
that cleverness can be a substitute for
writing well and following directions.

For the most part, the essays are wells
written and interesting. If a student wanm
to read this book to get a general impres-
sion of college essays and the way admis-
sions officers view them, he will not be

too disappointed. If he hopes instead
to find a magic solution to all essay-writing
woes, he will be sadly disappointed.
Can this book help? — no more so than a
chat with an English teacher. (The book
Costs $7 95; a chat would be cheaper.) The
editors hope it will provide inspiration. but
better inspiration can be found in collec-
tions of essays, poems. and other good
literature which can be borrowed from a
public library.

The book‘s editors. Brian Kasbar and
Boykin Curry, are trying to tap the vast
market of students who are willing to do
anything and pay anything to make the
process of applying to colleges easier and
more successful. It is sad, though. that
they try to disguise their blatantly en-
trepreneurial efforts in an ostensible at
tempt to help the suffering masses of high
school seniors. The editors are not stuid;

they tell the reader outright that it would
be suicidal to plagiarize or paraphrase any
of H19 book’s material. Yet. one cannot
help but ieel that many panicky ap-
plicants, intimidated by the quality and
subject matter of the essays, may try to do
just that.

The editors also have a cushy deal as far
as proiits are concerned. The applicants
do all the work; the editors get the money.
Though Kasbar and Curry use these
essays with permission, the authors
receive no compensation tor their efforts,
John Williams, a Grinnell lreshman whose
essay is featured in the book. said he never
really thought about asking for money.
Kasbar and Curry asked if they could use
his essay and he agreed because the idea

New
College
Hang-out?

By Christine Black

Although the shock of the Pub closing
may have passed, the campus is draped by
a heavy silence every Friday and Satur-
day night. Inferring an increase in profits
and student crowds in local beer parlors
seems to be a logical assumption, but
Larry Bryan, owner of The Bar, feels dil»
[erently
For 10 years. The Bar has been the
center for lonprscoopers and other
townspeople. According to Bryan, The Bar
has not changed much with respect to the
students. in earlier years, “live entertains
ment was provided and we used to handle
more students."

it any change in student patronage has
occurred since last semester. Bryan feels

. that fewer students gather at The Bar now

than last spring, He asserts that the clos»
ing of the Pub has no bearing on this situa-
tion, but instead, “the lax drinking
privileges on campus reduce student sup.
port. " Bryan also acknowledges that at the
beginning of the year students may be a lit
tle hesitant to party, whereas at the end of
the year. seniors may be more inclined to
socialize. ‘

Bryan does not expect an increase in
future student attendance, but if The Bar
does pick up more college clis "91. he does
not anticipate a decrease in town business.
Says Bryan. “most lolks who come to The
Bar are already accustomed to college
Students so there wouldn’t be a conflict ol
any Sort.” He adds that most students who
hang out at The Bar now were mere last
semester.

Since Bryan does not expect any great

increases in crowds, he does not foresee
the necessity to make any external
changes. He feels that there is still ade-
quate space as well as an adequate
number ol bartenders and pitchers.
If you find yourself at The Bar on a
Saturday night without a place to sit and
drink your beer out of a paper cup. sit on
the stairs and wait [or a table.
