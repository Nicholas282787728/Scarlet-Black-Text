Prepping ° Obsolete .7

Perhaps eventually the students of Grinnell college will
become smart and abolish prepping altogether. But, since
that day of reason has not yet arrived, let‘s wrench our
minds out of the studies-andvsocial-life rut long enough to
recognize that tlle women caused the failure of their prep-
ping program, and they could conceivably make a good pro-
gram work if they wanted to. Certainly if it hadn’t been for
housemeetings, no one' would have known one existed this

year.

An outstanding aspect of previous south campus pro-_

grams was the emphasis of blacklisting by upperclassmen,
in addition to freshman emphasis on the desirability of
their not being blacklisted The prospect in past years of
winning, rather than having to give, a hall spread seems
to have been much more of an impetus to action than this
year‘s possibility of adding to the hall's collection of ”dust,
catchers.” Admittedly, integrated halls made this particular
emphasis on blacklisting difficult. But, some kind of group
pressure on upperclassmen is necessary.

It seems that the only aspects of prepping participated
in with enthusiasm and remembered with pleasure ignore
the days when upperclassmen required extra performance of
the freshmen. No one seems the least concerned with the
basicduties, which are theoretically so vital. ,

Actually in our women‘s non-sorority living arrange-
ment, the values of prepping_are largely fictional. Its sup-
posed purposes can be accomplished better by a program of
cooperation, rather than one of supposed dominance. Prep-
ping offers only two values to the freshman Woman: the
enjoyment of having fun with other members of her class,
and the skills of cooperation with them and against the
upperclassmen. Some upperclass women feel a satisfaction
in participating in a program designed to unite and enthuse
the freshmen. A few others enjoy prepping itself.

Prepping cannot accomplish even these, attainable pur-
poses if it does not have enthusiastic support. The only
activities of prepping which have received support have
been the “dress-up" and “extra-duties” days. So, if we must
have prepping, why not limit it to the worthwhile activ-
ities?

An intensive program concentrated into one week,

kept alive by changing ideas and by incentives for both
upperclassmen and freshmen, would be a memorable, worth-
while experience. It might even border on hazing—and we
might discover that disciplined hazing is really what we
want. solar

By Gene Thompson

North Campus is the scane of
a recent outbreak of cl "
directed at mcr
thods and dual
ity of hous
keeping. One,
particular objeo
tion from a sour
dent’s point ol
View is raise
against the new
trash — and
paper » collect-
ing facilities.

It used to be that three metal
cans did the job fairly well.
Now we are confronted with
galvanized garbage cans and
four huge wooden boxes, “built—
in” at the ends of the loggia.
One north campus wit has al-
ready termed the arrangement
“G’oosclaw's alley.”

There is some practical ob-
jecion, it seems, to the noise
and unsightliness of garbage
cans in such a prominent pl»
suion, sud to lhe neoessicy
of driving the housekeeping
truck on MacEachron ﬁeld
(through a gigantic mudhole
formed at the east entrance),

, . . . l

Maids, janitors, and similar
persons usually referred to
(sometimes condescendingly) as
“common laborers," are seldom
paid an adequate wage. And
there is almost never a spiritual
reward in their work—if there
is, it has to be conjured up
within a romantic mind (untyP'
iosl of their group).

Perhaps lol- this reason, the
laborer resents (or at least
disregards) a recent eﬂort on
the part of Grinnell college
to force its worldlamous and
soul-inspiring ideals into the
realm of ﬂoor-scrubbing and
sewer-cleaning.

bulletin board in the physical
plant asks that everyone “take
pride in their job“ and realize
their importance in the work of
American education. Another
mimeogmphed sheet, appearing
shortly after the summer cons
ferences, says: “You will prob-
ably work harder during the
year to come than you have
Ever worked before, but rm
sure that in the end we can all
be proud of the job you have
done."

The notes of thanks from our
president and board of trustees,
which also appear on, the bullev
tin board, are short, sincere, and
obviously well-meant. They make
no attempt to capitalize,on s
“thank you" in order to de-

mand harder work in the fu-
ture.

But it is difficult to rec0n~
cile the “pride - anrl - proud"
messages with the situation of
the “common laborer.” A sin-
gle maid, responsible for the
upkeep of a building lhe size
of one of the Ynunker halls,
isn’t too likely to meditate on
the spiritual aspects of scrIIlv
hing out a shower or disin-
feeling a toilet stool, She is
all the more unlikely to do so

’irnum, ask the maximum,

if she is not being paid an
adequate wage.

It is truly remarkable that
the physical plant staff can
come through with a quality
performance when it is asked
of themilike the ”logistic mar-
vel” of the Convocation week-
end. It is then that the admin-
istrazar, inventing such lsrms as
“pride" and "proud," can praise
the job well done and once
more believe in the value of
words to pay wages.

But the shining “logistic
marvel” is somethlng entirely
different from the day-today
cleaning of the resident): balls.

I: is s drudge job, and if it
is well done (as it is, in some
instances) it should be paid
for with an adequate wage. u
is no secret um Grinnell col-
lege pays a nearly minimum
wage.

There is nothing shameful or
immoral about paying a mini-
mum wage. But to pay the min-
and
then expect a spiritual revival
of the Calvinistic Work and Duty
philosophy is expecting the pros
verbial silk purse from the pro-
verbial sow’s ear.
