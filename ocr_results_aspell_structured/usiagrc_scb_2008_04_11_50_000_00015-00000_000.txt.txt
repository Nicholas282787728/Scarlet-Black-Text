As tross country nlnncr Cl Iarlic Knuth os crossed
the ﬁnish line, he had ﬁnlshed and won yet anothcr race.
But this rac: wouldn’t win a conference championship. It
wouldn't be mentioned on the college website. It raised
money for hungry lalnillcs and brought rlte town or
Grinnell and the college eloser together,

On May 3, the fourth annual Honﬁn’ Ir 5k Run/
Walk will [Ilka plaoo. Beginning at Merrill Park at 10
a in, the run will take place not only to promote com-
munity ﬁtness but also to raise money tor cliality. Sign
up for Hooﬁn It has already begun and will continue
until the day orrhe rate.

This year, one ortho .nain orga~
nizers is Erin Sindcwald'OS, a Mor-
tar Board member and Grinnell
cross-country ntnnor “I’ve been
really interested in it since ﬁrst year
and I wanted to get involved, and
hoing a rnnnor, road rates have a
place in my hoart,"said Sindonald.
“It's a competition but everybody’s
working together for the same cause
wlneh is somethingithis is really
cheesyibur it’s really beautiful”

All proceeds of the run go towards the Midtlowa
community Action Group (MICA) and Heifer lnrcr-
national. Whilo MlCA provides food items locally to
low-income residents, l-Ieifei lnrcmational works to end
poverty and hunger abroad.

Since its creation by three Grinnell students, the

Hoofin’ It: fourth annual all- -commnuity charity run

the town around oflt. said Bowr ‘IIoofin’ It bridges the
gap between college and town

oao way in which the ootnnnttoo bridges this gap
is by purchasing t-shiits for the event from a local shop.
“Awards Unlimited does our r—shirts," said Sindcwald.
“Vi/e could go elsewhere and probably got shirts for
eheaper but I think that keeping it loeal aatl {oeused
on Grinncll and Grinncll businesses Is something that’s
good."

The committee is also in the process ofgotting con-
tributions from town members and businesses to sup
port the eanse. “We go into town and ask for money and
donations to offset the cost of Lhc race," said Sindcwald.
“Wo also ask for gift certiﬁcates (torn
prizes which is important because it
draws more students and town mem~
bers to participate."

Though Hooﬁn’ It is only in its
ronrth yoar, tho organization already
soonas to draw many participants. “We
had over 200 participants last year and
are hoping {or even more tlns year,”
said Boyer.

Many of these pattieipants are
members oflhc track and cross counr
try toarns. “Just ahonr [all rho (loss country toarn] par-
ticipates," said Knuth, “But since it‘s during the tlack
season, we’re not supposed to go balls to walls."

In order to get entries from outside ofjust Grinnell,
the event has been posted onliae on several running for
rum websites. “It brings people from Des Moines, Iowa
City, Cedar Rapids :0 come and participate, which is
nioo to get a little oornporltion for Crosswouurry runr
ncrs," said Merklin. “We make sure to do it a weekend
that there isn't a meet so that runnors can palticipate"
