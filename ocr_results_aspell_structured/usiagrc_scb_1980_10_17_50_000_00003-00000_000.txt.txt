A children’ s

by Wendy Bobbitt

In Hie town of Grinnell, children
never have a reason to complain or be-
ing bored. With the Uncle Sam’s Club
now in its 75th year. children can par-
ticipate in a host of activities alter
school including games, crafts, sports,
learning skills, and cooking. There is
also a filth and sixth grade night, held
every Friday. when youngsters dance
to a jukebox.

The Uncle Sam’s Club is a recrea-
tional club serving children ages four to
13 in the Grinnell community. It was
lounded in 1902 by two Grinnell students
(one appropriately named Sam) and
has been in the same building on 3rd
' and Pearl Streets ever since, Funded
by the United Way and personal donar
tions, the club is free to all.

Although the club has gone through
some bumpy times within the past [our
years. it is still very much alive due to
the return at Claire Thomazin as direc»
tor of the club and the initiation of
Laura Brodsky as the new Grinnell stu-
dent coordinator for the club. Brodsky
glowed with pride and enthusiasm
when speaking ol the club. She describ-
ed the club as “a home away from
home, a place where they know there's
someone to listen, someone who cares.“
She explained that many oi the kids
have working class parents and the
club gives them the opportunity to do
things that they might not be able to al-
lord to do,

Indeed, there is plenty for them to do.
The club is a children's paradise. The
interior of the building is warm and
iriendly with a bright striped rug, come
tortable lurnilure, and smiles

when this reporter arrived, the
children were in the middle of their
“soda pop break.“ Never had she seen
children having so much tun:

The most amazing thing ol all was the
woman handing out 20 cent sodas to the
children. This woman, Thomazm, has
been working with the Uncle Sam’s
Club lor 25 years and is just as ens
thusiastic as when she started. “It
belongs to the children or Grinnell,” she

place between the end of classes and
Commencement.

The committee polled its class to get
ideas tor the speaker, “We got maybe
40 ballots; not a very good turnout,”
said Desmond. Although there were few
proposals, nearly half at them sug»
gested Alan Alda. Most of the remain-
ing ballots were split between Barbara
Jordan and Commoner,

In May, the student committee met
with the Faculty Honorary Degree
Committee to "argue about it," as
Bowhay said, He also said. “It's tradi-
tion to give the speaker an honorary
degree and they (the laculty commit-
tee) wanted someone acceptable."

The combined committees decided
not to pursue Aida tor two reasons. “I
guess it’s really hard to get anyone
lrcm the entertainment world,” ex-
plained Desmond. “And we thought she
(Jordan) might be easier to get and
they (the faculty) seemed to like her
better, too,”

College Relations then tried to obtain
Jordan, but the former congresswoman
was unable to make it. Commoner was
then contacted and he accepted. “We
got somebody on the list, which was
good, because you usually never get
anybody that’s on your list," com-
mented Boivhay,

Desmond feels Commoner will ap-
peal to the students because he is
engaged in many diiierent activities.
“He's relevant especially because oi
the economy problems and the focus on
politics this election year,” she said.
"And he's involved in the issues oi to-
day."
