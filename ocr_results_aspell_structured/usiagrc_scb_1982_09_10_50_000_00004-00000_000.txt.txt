Judicial Council verdict
is well deserved

The Judicial Council deserves commendation for its swift and pur»
poseful action in the case of the student who attacked a fire alarm.
Any type of vandalism in the dorms in inexcusable, but damage to fire
alarms is especially idiotic.

Dorm fires are a real possibility on a campus where students smoke
and use stoves, hotrpots, curling irons, candles, etc. on every floor of
every dorm. The fire alarm system is the only way someone on the
third or fourth floor of a building can know a fire has started on the
first floor. ’

Besides being damaged, alarms are often set off for “fun.” This
practice serves only to anesthetize dorm residents to the alarm’s
ringing, If students become accustomed to hearing false alarms they
will simply roll over and go back to sleep the one time me alarm is for
real.

Judicial Council’s stern sentence recommendation for the student
found guilty of deliberately tampering with the alarm system is en
tirely justified. Potential offenders ought to keep in mind me conse-
quences of their actions, not only for themselves, but for the rest of
the campus.

Party security guards

are a common sense

necessity

Some Joint Board members are becoming too upset about and spen-
ding too much SGA time arguing about the recent security force pro-
posals.

The rule recently instituted requiring the use of security guards at
allecampus parties where liquor is served is for students’ and SGA’s
own protection. Why argue against an injunction which will save par-
ty organizers, hall presidents, SGA and partyvgoers in general a lot of
headaches?

Student security guards hired to check IDs and prohibit non-
college people from entering and drinking at college parties could
prevent law suits against hall presidents and the college for which
there have been precedents at other schools.

For instance, if an underage, nonrcollege person is drinking at a cols
lege party and then has an accident driving home the person in
charge of the party (most likely the hall president) and/or the college
may be sued because that person was allowed to drink on our campus.

Any damage done to dorms by outsiders during parties might be
prevented by a security force, also. This intervention would save
dorm and SGA funds in the long run. The cost of paying the guards
would probably not equal or surpass the cost of repairs for damage
done.

Those who argue that Joint Board should have been consulted by
the administration before the decision to require the guards was
made are wasting their time and SGA time This is a rule which
should have been established years ago The administration is only
trying to protect itself and students

Turning the tables

0n the cover of the October issue of Playboy
magazine next lo the picture of a very scuntty-
clad Tunyo Roberts {who the hell is this person,
or /or that matter, who the hell cares} it says A
Playboy specul Report: SEX ON CAMPUS
1982 7 It's hotter than you think . . . It's hotter
than we thought!

Inside there is o report about the sexual
climate of 20 colleges and universities in the
country, and an indepih article stating lots of
facts and figures about the average college stu~
dent's sexual behavior or, as the case may be,
Lula of sexual behavior.

The magazine ushed such probing questions
as: “How close or formal o relattonshlp t5
necessary [or you before you enter a sexual reld
tionshlp?"or ”Do you often, sometimes or neucr
have sex with someone the some day you meet 9"
or ﬁnally that all-time favorite “Which sexual
practices have you included in your sex We?"

So as you cun see, the ruins at Playboy weren't
exactly shy about oshing us tiberoted college
hide some rather personal und, in some cases,
obnoxious questions. But, [um dlsgrcssing. . .

degrees: Too much thinking and not enough

Taking the Personal LeaVe

Having just returned from an eight
month “personal leave of absence," I felt
obliged to enlighten the campuS'communle
ty as to the wonders of the extended vacar
tion (For one thing, something about he
mg gone seems to have made all those
Grinnell cliches terribly amusing. which
isn’t to say that they haven't always been

Late last December tabout finals time),
I decided to leave our llttle enclave of
academia and venture forth into the world
beyond Grinnell. My plans for a Jaunt
overseas quickly shelved by financlal con-
siderations, I found my outrof-Grinnell ex-
perlence beginning behind a McDonald's
cash register. 1 had left Grinnell seeking
relief from its relative overv
lntellectualism, but McDonald’s proved
something of an overecompensation. So I
look a volunteer position at an Animal
Hospital, This quickly grew very in
teresting, but McDonald's seemed to grow
as quickly less so, so 1 began to seek gain-
lul employment elsewhere.

First rejecting a crattily presented
“Managementetrainee” pOSILiOn selling
National Geographic prints dooretoedoor, I
lound myscli a waiter at Arme's, my
suburban home town's only really "nice"
restaurant. Waiting tables was both far
more fun and profitable than McD’s, so I
hung up the old paper and nylon disposable
hat and left Ronald McDonald to sell his
own hamburgers. Having ﬁnally settled in
to an enjoyable, well~paying job, it seemed
almost inevitable that I break my. foot on
Mother's Day and ﬁnd myself priveleged
to a complete summer vacation li.e. laid
off),

I was virtually bored to tears until the
Summer Session began at Loyola Univer-
sity in Chicago, where I took two classes.
Loyola is a hon-residential school located
across the street from Water Tower Place
on North Michigan Ave., the chic strip of
Chicago‘s daytime community. It should
suffice to say the atmosphere was very dif-
ferent from Grinnell‘s. While I really did
like going to Loyola, it really made me ape
preciate the academic quality of Grinnell,
bum in terms of structure and personnel.

Allin all, my “semester off” (one might
call it a belated version of the popular
“fi h-semester sabbatical") was a sur,
prisingly rewarding experience 7 turning
out to be a great deal more educational
and less tedious than one might expect.
And ll. took me only a brief visit here last
spring to be sure I didn’t miss Grinnell
much. True, 1 grew very tired or
McDonald's. True also, my EDP class at
Loyola left a very soggy, unchallenging

taste in my intellectual mouth. But this
was all part at the very illuminating peoe
ple, places and things I encountered out
there in the ”real world,”

Here at Gl'lnnell, one develops, and
almost inevitably becomes overly absorb-
ed in one’s LiferatrGrinnell Needless lo
say, LifeeatrGrinnell is hardly the last
word on Reality. In fact, the nature of the
relationship between Grinnell and the Real
World is a not so infrequently questioned
thing. No! to say that the Real World 15 the
sort of lsolalable phenomenon with which
thlngs are easily compared; it is likely to
prove ratherelusive from any perspective,
But I am now firmly of the Opinion that a
well-timed leave of absence from our

To the Editor:

l was among those many unforluantes
who chose to attend the first Show of the
Ulmer Trio last Saturday evening, The ex
cellent promotion campaign during the
prior week had me anxiously anticipating
an evening of good, progressive music.
What I received was a wait in line, a late
start, a handful of songs and the notrat-all
progressive feeling that somehow l,_and
many others, had been had, ,

The concerts committee spent a great
deal of money in promoting the Ulmer
Trio. The media blitz was first~rale; it is
difficult to imagine the possibility of a liv-
ing, breathing, noncomatose Grinnell stu-
dent being unaware of the impending
Ulmér concert. The' ad campaign was ef-
fective, then, in what it set out to do; to. me ,
lorm us of and to sell the Ulmer Trio.

In addition to promotional expenses,
there is the matter of the group's ‘ap-
pearance fee. The concerts committee no
doubt paid a handsome sum to land a
group of the calibre and acclaim of the
Ulmer 'l‘rio. To this‘ Ihave no objection, for
to schedule a diverse and popular concerts
calendar it is necessary to pay the going
rates. I would hope that the concerts com-
mittee will continue to schedule an‘ in:
teresting, multi-iaceted concert program .
for this semester and semesters to come.

I find it curious, then, that such a
previously first-rate - production should
suddenly crumble to pieces at the moment
of truth The show began neat“ half an
hour late, for what reasor ii I do not
know. Onceunderway, the bi . e‘tol

which was temporarily fixed, then intere
rupted again as the pedal in question was
