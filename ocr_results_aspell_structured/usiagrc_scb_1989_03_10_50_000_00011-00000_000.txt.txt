Against the Grain

Being the grand progressive I
am so well known for being, I of
course relished the opportunity I
received a f cw days ago to read the
“Freedom Charter." For those of
you Ilnawttrc, ttie “Freedom Char-
lot” is the sttitetiienioi‘purpose tor
one oftho inatorgroups ﬁghting to
end apartheid iiiSouth Africa. Stu-
dents to End Apartheid has seen fit
tupostcopicsofthisstate-
niciitaroundcatitpus,and
that is how I came aboii
reading one.

Now I'm no great lover of the
npzirdicid govemment of South
Africa, True, I don‘t support ttic
boycotts. but I do feel that a go»
eminent of elites is wrong Ifthis
“Freedom Charter" is reflective of
the government that would replace
apartheid, however, I Can't. help
but feel that the people of South
Africa tire going from the prover-
hitii frying pan into the fire.

“Why so?" you ask, Well, I'll
tell you. There are parts of the
“Freedom Charter" Lhat are not
WCIHhOtIgl‘l-Oul and other parts
that arejust plain contradictory,

The ﬁrst and most blaring fal-
lacy is thecontrtidictory statements
that freedom of speech and belief
will be guaranteed to all, yet it is a
punishablecrimecitherlo”insull"
any national group, or to preach
“national, race or colour discrimi-
nation and contempt.-’3 Freedom of
speech is not sorneLhing thatcan be
selectively employed. If the aur
thors advocate freedom of speech,
it must apply to EVERY idea and
belief. The broad and vague “pro-
tection from insult" thatall groups
will theoretically have can be used
to silence far too many ideas.

Economically, the “Freedom
Charter" advocates a communist
government. “All the land will be
re-divided amongstthosewhowork
it” and yet “people shall not be
robbed of their cattle." In order for
the land to be rc-divided, SOME-
BODY is going to get robbed of
their cattle. “Mineral wealth be-
neath the soil. the banks and mo
nopolyindustryshallbetransferred
to the ownership of the people as a
whole; all other industry and trade
shall be conLrollcd to assist the
well-being of the people."

Since most of the foreign-based
businesseshavepullodoutofSouth
Africa thanks to the efforts of
groups like the SEA. to which
industries exactly are they refer
ring? The foreign-based compa—
nies sure aren‘t going to reopen
any of Lheir South African opera-
tions under a communist govem-

merit. “There Shall be a 40rhour
working\vcek,al‘intionallninititiinl
\vagc. paid annual leave. anti sick
leave for all workers, and ntatcr-
ttity leave on full pay for all work
irigriiothers." Sounds liken pretty
good deal, I'm sure all the workers

even working here in

don’t have a paid maternity leave
program, either, But wait, there's
more . . .

“People will have the right to

t2 sation shall be provided for all.
..."Therc's more abouthow they

build parks, etc. My personal far
voritc, however. is “ReSt, leisure
and recreation shall be the rightof
all.”

lead see the lawsuits now: work»
erssuingthestatc.theircmploycrs,
whoever. for the infringement of
their “right to leisure."

Of course my biggest question
is. “Where are they going to getall
the money for all Lhcsc special
projects?“

Someothcrbiggies are,“Who’s
going to bein chargcofthc vast in-
come redistribution?” ”What in-
centive will there be to create new
industry?" “How are they going to
transform a nation of unemployed
rioters into this wonderland with
cheap Itighrquality housing and a
national health care plan?" “How
do they expect to keep everything
so cheap and plentiful when most
otherestof their policies discour-
age foreign business and tend to
cause an increase in cost for any
industry they have remaining?”

Yes. apartheid IS bad, This
“Freedom Charter,” however, is
nothingmorethanafantasy. Given
that it was written in 1955, during
thcheightofttholdWar.isilany
wonder that the United States gov-
eminentdidn‘tjumprightinivitha
highly supportive attitude? Apui’tr
heid must be ended, but the people
of South Africa deserve a better
prospect for the future than this
charteroffers. Itdocsn‘thavctobe
democratic. it doesn’t have to be a
capitalism. it can be any form of
government the people want.

But it does have to be realistic.

Clash Over Abortion

As most of yort know, the abor-

attempt to cover to
some degree.

The upcoming Supreme Court
decision has spurred antirabortion
groups to new levels of activtty.
One especially prornitient such
group that I’ll be focusing on calls
itself “Operation Rescue" and
blocks entrances to abortion Clinr
ics. Whiletheyclaimtobenonvttv
tent, I have a hard time believing
this, given how a major tactic in
their arsenal is verbal abuse. which
they heap on women and doctors
who attempt to enter the clinics.
These people also follow women
home. liarrass them on the phone,
throw blood on them, condone
bombing clinics,etc. Andtheseare
people deeply concerned with the
value of human life. mind you.
Granted.someriglit-to-lifers don’t
condone these sleazy tactics or
engage in all their hypocrisics.
However, far too many allow
groups such as Operation Rescue
to speak for them. Thus. by their
silence they are considered to be
accomplices to their despicable
tactics.

I wonder sometimes if I'm the
only one who sees a massive con-
tradiction in the fact that someone
who claims life is sacred bombs
abortion clinics. For that matter.
the coandicu‘on between some
one who claims life is sacred and
then demand that a young teenage
girlruntherl ’ofdelivcriiigababy
is mindrboggling. It seems that
many antirabortion crusaders pay
lip service to allowing exceptions
to abortion in the case of rape and
endangerment to the mother. But
that woman at whom they spat and
screamed obscenities may have
been told by her doctor that a preg-
nancy would kill her. Gosh. Op-
eration Rescue,1’m touched byyour
committment to human life.

Just a few weeks ago in New
York, a pregnant woman, Nancy
Klein. was putinto acoma by acar
accident. Her doctors advised her
husband, who had been given legal
custody ofliis wife. that it was un-
likely that shc or the baby would
survive, whereas if the fetus were
aborted thewoman'schances of re-
covery wouldbc greatly increased.
So what did two “rightrto-Iife” at-
torneys do'.l They frlcdalawsuitat—
tempting to bar the husband from
havingtheabortionperformed,thus
placing both the mother and baby
in jeopardy.

It seems to me that these ace
tivists can't possibly know the .
of s:

tioncrs ignore these
factors. And note that quite often
the same men wtio crusade against
abortion (Reagan and his replacer
merit. the big shrub) .ilso cut child

While “Abortion is murder" is it
catchy, sensationahstic slogan, it
doesn'tcut it as a rational argument
against abortion, since only a true

obtained by the committee show
that what upset the FBI so much
was Dr. King‘s success in or-
ganizing the civil-rights move-
ment.

Despite this and other abuses
discovered by the Committee.
Iohn Tower refused to sign the
final report. In an attached
statement Tower admits that the
committee's findings were valid.
but. objects to their rec»
ommendations. Specifically, the
committee recommended that a
law be passed explicitly requiring
that the executive branch obtain a
warrant before instituting a wire
tap. Tower fell that such a law
would be a bad idea. The com-
mittee further recommended the
repeal of the Smith and Vorhis
acts. These acts, in part, required
that “subversive” or ”Violent" or-
ganimtions register with the FBI
or face criminal penalties. Both
“subversive" and “violent" were
to be defined by the CIA and FBI.
Traditionally this has meant any
organization opposing the
government. or any organization
not affiliated with the govern-
ment which uses force, even in
self-defense. such as with the
American Indian movement.
Government agencies using force,
even in extreme cases sucli as the
assassination of American Indian
movement or Black Panther Party
members. were not using vio-
lence, but rather “lawful rer
straint." Again Tower opposed
this idea.

Tower‘s most appalling ac-
tion came towards the end of the
committee existence, Just as the
committee was preparing to in
vestigate the FBI and CIA‘s po-
1i ' allyvvtolivated siege of AIM

rifle) illegally invaded a peaceful

Reservation. The Oglala Firer

ended with the dcathes of one
AIM member. and two FBI
agents, and the sham trial and
political imprisonment of AIM
member Lenord Peltier. Rather
nouxly. FBI sent forged letters to
King supporters before demonr
strations telling them that the
demonstration had been canceled,
they broadcast false instructions
on citizens-band radio frequencies
used by demonstration coordina-
tors, and they mailed anonymous
and forged letters to various
fringe groups with the intent of
bringing about the assassination
of Dr. King (I should note that
all the evidence suggests that
they failed, and that there is no
connection between the actual
assassination of Dr. King and the
FBI). Internal FBI memoranda
than investigating this ﬂagrant
violation of law. Tower was my
strumcntal in having the
committee’s activities tenninaied.
Public documents show that the
investigation was halted as a di-
rect result of the Oglala Fireﬁght.

As you can see, chumminess
with military contractors is
hardly the worst of Tower’s sins.
However, not even one senator
has mentioned Tower’s conduct
on the select committee. Unfor-
tunately, neither did Shapiro.
When the drinking, sexism, ﬁ-
nancial indiscreLions, and defense
of the FBI and CIA are taken to—

that John Tower is not the man
