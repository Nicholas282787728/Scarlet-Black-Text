walked on towards the unrestored
part of the wall. The crumbled
ruins and half-fallen towers
seemed cold and hostile to me.
The broken rock looked sharp,
like broken bones sticking out
from an open wound, Sol turned
back with a few friends to get
lunch. About six others
continued along the ruins.

Once we got back down to
the entrance, the contrast was
striking. We had returned to the
20th century, A bold yellowrand-
black sign greeted us.
“Mastercurd: Your ticket to
China." As we left the muted
browns for the rows of peddlers’
stands displaying the bright reds
and pinks and greens of T-shirts
and quilts. it seemed the hawkers
were all trying to make up for the
colorlessness of the wall, trying
to superimpose modern
civilization’s thutnbprint on the

succeed.

After lunch, we met to ride
our bus back to Beijing. A

continued onto the ruins%ame
running up. There had been an
explosion on the wall, he'said.
The group of students who’d
gone on to the ruins had heard it
btit didn’t think anything of it at
first. They were used to the
numerous explosions we heard in
China from construction projects
or army exercises. However, the
exploston was followed by the
sound ofa woman screaming.

They didn‘t

My classmates ran back
toward the last watchtower.
Within 75 feet of the tower, a
scarf fluttered to the earth. Then
they noticed the bits of cloth,
clothing, pieces of flesh, and
blood. Blood was splattered
along the dirt and rocks and wall,
One student scaled the wall first
and ran into the lower level of the
tower. He saw bodies, body
parts, and a head. A woman
shrickcd and screamed that her
sister was hurt. Blood gushed
from the sister‘s leg and head.
Her forehead was missing bone.
Luckily my classmate knew first
aid and tried to help her,

Other tourists drawn by the
screaming came up, The Chinese
just stared. The foreign tourists
refused to help despite my
classmatc’s pleas. “It’s best just
to let these things work
themselves out,” one man advised
them. Finally a Chinese medical
student came forward. My
classmate acted as translator be-
tween him and the injured
woman’s sister, who said they
were tourists from New Zlealtmd.

The other students ran down
the wall. They tried to convince

cvcry police officer they met of
what had happened. No one
would block off the path leading
to the devastation, and more
tourists came, taking pictures but
not helping.

Eventually, one-and—a-half
hours later, they brought the
woman down on a green army
canvas. I watched as two of my
classmates helped carry her down
and hold a compress to her head.
They went with the ambulance.
Another classmate comforted the
sister, who was obliged to stay
behind to utik to the police.

We all had to go to the police
station to file reports. I
remember the absolute physical
sensation of QUlET as we waited
in the police office. Sunlight
streamed in the windows, trying
to make a dent in the shadows
that clung to us like dust. i
remember seeing the New
Zealand woman with her head in
her hands, her blue jeans
splattered with pieces of ﬂesh and
her white sneakers dappled with
red blood. We could do nothing
but wait as the police interviewed
the witnesses; one of our
chapcrons served as translator.

Later we learned the
explosion had been caused by two
homemade explosive devices used
by a Chinese couple to commit
suicide there on the wall. Their
relatives came forward and said
the couple were having an affair
although they were married to
other people. (We learned a week
later that the tourist from New
Zealand died from her head
injuries)

When I think back to this
day, I remember riding back in
the bus, seeing the Wall’s stark,
clean contour against the cold
blue sky. And then I remember
the face of my classmate who
told me of his frustration when
trying to convince people to help
him, trying to convince the
police to come, trying to
convince anyone that something
terrible had actually happened,
and each time failing. it seems
no one was willing to abandon
their faith in normalcy, in the
imtnutzibility of the mundane.

Hard work pays off,

While the six»point loss to
Knox wasn't nearly as
impressive, it did illustrate that
the Pioneers are better than their
record indicates, and that theey
can play with any team in the
league. Not only was Grinnell
seconds away from upsetting the
division-leading Siwash (another
winner of a nickname), but they
kept the conference's leading
scorer at 24 points per game in
check, holding him to seven.

The young Pioneers also
demonstrated great perseverance
against an older, more
experienced Knox team, With
1:41 left in the first half, Grin-
nell put together an eight-point
run to pull within five, 38-33 at
intermission.

second half. Howland‘s lurnr

8381. But that was as close as
it would get.

While they did receive the
loss, it must be noted that the
Pioneers played a very sound ball
game. Holland Neal had a whale
of a night, pouring in a career»
high 25 points. Chamberlain
established a new career best
himself, knocking in 17. BJ.
Jahn and Iacobsen led Grinnell
with 10 rebounds apiece.

The Pioneers were in the
Monmouth game up until the
early moments of the second half.
From then on in, Grinnell
couldn’t contain their larger
opponents, Nevertheless, the
Pioneers did play strong
throughout, gaining due respect
from Monmouth in the process.

According to Westlund, “If
we play well, we can play with
anyone in the league," Saturday's
performance definitely bears out
this point.

more ”magic" this evening at
