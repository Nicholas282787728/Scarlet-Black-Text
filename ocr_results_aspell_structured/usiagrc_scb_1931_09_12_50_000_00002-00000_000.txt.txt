LIMITATIONS EVIDENT

Grillllell graduates have found the outside
world a little rough this summer. Many hare not
yet found positions, and there are others who are
not all satisfied with the work which they have.
Some are beginning to wonder abollt the real value
of a college education.

Perhaps the Grinnell personnel department
has not been effective as the placement bureaus of
some other illstitutions. That is a situation that
must be left to opinion. The student should only
consider the position ill which he puts the places
mellt bureau.

It acts as a buffer between hiln and the elllployor
as he ﬁrst applies for a position. Graduation to
many students means a certiﬁcate of a thorough
training in a speciﬁc ﬁeld. That is not tlle case, for
almost every‘ student ﬁnds that once he gets to
tile practical work of his ﬁeld, his knowledge of
the problems and how to meet them is astonishr
ingly limited,

The college placement service in many occasions
makes it possible for the graduate to obtain a posi
tion where he can use his education to advantage
ill learning without meeting the severe setbacks
of too great a 1' 'ponsibility immediately.

__ VVitll experienced men looking for positions,
lt is hard to find a place for the student who must
learn the business. With a limited ﬁeld at ally
time, the personnel bureau is doubly handicapped
this year. '

WHEN RESULTS APPEAR

Although it is hard to obtain deﬁnite enroll-
ment ﬁgures early in the year, Grinnell college
ofﬁcials are assured that the freshman enrollment
of this year surpasses that of 1930. To have kept
the enrollment at the same level would have been
all accomplishment All increase with economic
condltions what they are is even more of a surr
prise. :

The Scarlet and Black pointed ollt ill an edir
torial last year that the benefits to be derived from
the then newly established public relations dc-
partment could not be judged from the enrollment
immediately following its establishment, That
seems borne out in the freshman class of this year.

Grillnell’s enrollment increase is probably the
result of several factors of which the work of the
public relations department must be considered
ﬁrst. The increased work by the college news serv-
ice has been effective as well as that by campus
cori‘espondents who have almost doubled Griuncll
news ill state papers over the last three yars.

 

Depression has been respollsihleafo smaller
freshman classcs ill ill-ally schools and must cere
taillly have kept the Grinnell newcomers at a
smaller ﬁgure than would have been the ease in
periods of normal economic stability. Ill this re
gard, Grinncll’s efforts to see that every worth-
while student is given a chance to attend college
is worthy of commendation and also partly rc-
spollsihle for enrollment. ﬁgures. Scholarships, cred-
it, zllld a maximum of stlldcllt positions on the
campus help men and women seeking a college edu-
cation.

While enrollment fluctuates from year to
year, the increase ill freshmen in 1931 marks Grin-
llell as one of the more stable colleges of the middle
west. A coordination of adnlilli rotive dcpar
ments has been responsible for this ill a large Lle~

THE GOLDEN AGE
(Fl-om Printers' Ink Monthly)

“The machines have brought us to the golden age
our ancestors dreamed about," Said 9. friend of mine
recently, "and we don't seem to know what to do about
it." When more than enough of everything to go around
is being produced by the aid of machines, a man quite
logically is going to need more than a few ‘bags of
gold to raise him above the crowd, for some day this
paradox will be solved by some men, and mere acquisi-
tiveness. a sensible enough habit in times of scarcity,
won't then be so sensible.

SMOKE DISAPPEARS

Steam heat and electricity as now provided at
Grillllell college may provide better service to the
students. On the whole, however, through ally
change in the heating of buildings, or a more de-
pendable lighting system, the average student will
scarcely be aware of any alteration.

The change will provide a distinct improve-
ment to the Grinnell campus in another way, how-
ever, it' the closing of the heating plant means the
abatement of the smoke nuisance hcre. Although
adlllittcdly there are instances and surroundings
lvlle e the smoke coming from the heating plant
hole would have been only a minor consideration,
it was distinctly out of place ill the Grillnell set
ting. The lack of smoke on the campus will be

appreciated by the student body as a whole.

THE EDITOR—A LUCKY CHAP!
(From the Iowa Publisher)

The newspaper reading public sees the newspaper
man as a jovial man—about‘town. He is here, there, and
everywhereia lucky chap with nothing to do, nothing
to sell, and of course, nothing to worry about.

Tbe newspaper man is a lucky chapilm doubt
about that. Not that, unlike the Chinese apes, he sees
evil, bears evil, and like them speaks no evil, but be
cause hears everything and sees everything.

He's always on the job whether he is in the ofﬁce
on the street, at home, riding in an auto with his family,
going as a delegate to a neighboring city, or entertain-
ing friends from out of the city.

To him, once he is seasoned, everything is copy,
so that he comes to measure everything, every event,
no matter how trivial it may appear to other eyes. in
terms of briefs, personals, stories, interviews, follow-ups
and editorials. Before his (sometimes tired) eyes there
is a constant unwinding of life's ﬁlm, and upon it many
a comedy. many a tragedy, and all the pathos and

bathos that blend together to make every one of the
twentycfout' hour periods in the total 365 different and

still just the same.

They are different because whichever one of the
gods it is that shufﬂes the events that are going to
happen on a given day does an exceedingly good job
of it, They are the some because the newspaper man
has learned to know that every day will have its quota
of drownings, murders, ﬁres, burglaries. arrests, punish»
ments, engagements. marriages, divorces, escapes from
matrimony and from prisons gangster killings. acts of
heroism and displays of cowardice.

Life and death run a fast race, and an even race,
And as they run the gauntlet the spectators are glad
to make elbow room for the newspaper man who may
wedge his way in with some such assertion as "There is
one birth every 36 hours in the United States." Thought
is provocative as one contemplates life and death, n
the midst of which all of us ﬁnd ourselves. And that is
what the assertions of the journalist must be if he
is going to do anything more than to scratch the sur-
face of life.

Many a newspaper man has ridden the horse of
popularity, content to do without originality. creative
ingenuity, or research. and be has gone his way with
fame unsung. Many another has been wag and Wit,
philosopher and pedagog to his readers. He has jested
and tilted, compared and differentiated, isolated and
grouped. Always he has done the new, the unexpected,
the unlocked-fol- thing. He is a Wamba and an Einstein
combined, seeing not only everything that is around
him, and near him. but penetrating to hidden things.

Such a fellow is the newspaper man, a jovial man-
about-town; here, there, and everywhere, a. lucky chap
with nothing to sell, nothing to do, and, of course,
nothing to worry about.
