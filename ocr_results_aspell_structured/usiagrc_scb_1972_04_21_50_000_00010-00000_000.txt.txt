Drop Two; Play Today?

As Monday's iesults indicate, there
were few bright spots during the day
for the Pioneel‘ssnletl Dick got
three hits and two RBIs in six times
at bat, the double play combination
of John Vldetlch, Mark Hanisch,
and Elll Johnson reeled on three
thin-killings in three attempts Corr
hell was held scoreless for three
innings, and the team managed to
stroke some timely foul balls, That
was about it,

On the negative side the pitchers
didn't pitch well, the Iielders didn’t
iieltl well, and the hitters didn’t
(you guessed it) hit well, in tact.
proficiency in all three phases of
the game was conspicuously absent,
the pitchers registered only lour
strikeouts in 11 innings otwork,
the defense contributed 15 errors,
and tho batters managed only seven
hits

in each game, the Pioneers scorcd
their runs all in one inning in the
opener, Marty lkel' load on the titth
lrame with a single and was tollow on
by Steve Varys’ walk filter two
outs, Dick doubled both runs homo
and scored moments later on Vide-
tich’s single

Four walks, a hit batsman, and a
Dick single got the Grinhellians oil
to a tour run lead in the third
inning ol the second game. The lcad
lasted until the Rams scored eight
in their hall of the lonrth

Part ot the team‘s troubles may
be attributed to lirst game litters
and to the tact that it only spent
about tour days or practice outside
before Monday, However, the team
must improve substantially in order
to notch any conterence wins because
thus tar this year Cornell has the
worst record ol any ol the teams in

 

 

its division. *3
