(Truth or Dare is an attempt to
iicrease the communication
between SGA and the campus
community tjoyiul or otherwrsel.
Hopetully it will be both a weekly
source oi inlormation and an ex-
pression oi my personal per—
spective. Throughout the year I
would appreciate any comments or
suggestions you might have
regarding this'column,

ii the year continues as it has
started, the environment clearly
will be one that demands student

itivism, We cannot passively

serve as decisions are being
made atlecting both our and iuturc
students’ education. it becomes the
responsibility of the students to

cop themselves iniormcd and to
communicate their opinions to
their student government

representatives and members at
the faculty, as well as the ad-
ministration. In addition we must
keep in mind that proposals for
responsible change can originate
with us Proposals tor change to
better the college are admirable,
but it is important to recognize that
future improvement need not
necessitate our present sacrifice.
There are alternatives.

In line with the need for an ins
iormed community, on open forum
with President Turner and Dean
Walker regarding the ad-
ministrative reorganization has
been scheduled tor 7:30 pm,
Thursday, September 23 in South
Lounge In addition Dean Walker
has scheduled an open forum at
7:30 pm. Thursday, September is
In South Lounge about the grading
proposal change passed by the

Truth or Dare

Curriculum Committee last
Spring.

The grading proposal includes
the institution of a creditserase
option, elimination of numerical
equivalents, addition ol a “B." and
“C-". and the institution of the ”B”
grade The Curriculum Committee
15 a student-faculty committee and
thus students did participate in the
formulation of the proposal
However it was obvious that
student opinion was divided on the
merits oi the proposal. Prior to the
open forum further inlormation
clarilying the parts at the proposal
will be distributed by SGA. The
iaculty will be considering the
proposal in October. It is important
that you careiully assess the
proposal and express your opinions
to the iaculty.

Back to school 8: wondering why

by PatEdmunds

I wonder why I don‘t feel as it i
have been away for three months?
it seems that it was justthe Sunday
before last that i boarded the red
eye special to Chicago in search oi
' b.only to ﬁnd on arriving that l
a d just enough time to catch the
next plane west to meet the
registrar’s deadline at Grinnell it
is, perhaps, nothing has changed

was startled to iind in my
mailbox on registration day, an
assignment tor a first class
meeting. One wonderrul excuse
uttered the next morning went like
this: “You mean, sir, there was
something important in all that
junk?”

The tood service is changed, the
coffee's improved, and on the
aiternoon that this was written
there was for the iirst time |n my
memory, music in the music
yening room at the appointed
.,,ur.

is it a quality oi triendships
made here that allows one to sit

_ down in the Forum and pick up on a

dialogue begun weeks before
without missing a beat? In my
mailbox on’lhat hot afternoon I
returned, there was too a
description of some administrative
reorganization. And all that
evening and well into the next day
students protested, as they have on
so many occasions, that they were
considered not lit to pass sound
judgement on an administrative
process i wonder now it this is our
nature and our lot”

Once on my search for truth at
academic institutions 1 walked out
in great remorse tor having agaii-
sought in those places that absolute
essence which Is not theirs to offer,
For it seemed to me at the time all
the linguists in Cambridge were
arguing in hight‘alutin' language
about Wlitch Came first, the
chicken or the egg?

I N 1972 I began workin for Mr. steak as a busboy, I was
15 and attending high sc ool in Elonmington, Minnesota.
in 1973 Mr, Steak was bought out by the Western Steak
House, and I stayed on as head busboy with this company.
In this same year, I was one of the people who began a iood
service known as HEART in Minn. in association with the
State Education Board & six school districts in the tradition

of FFA 8r DECA Clubs.

In 1974 I worked as a waiter & host for the Western

Slea khouse; I

also trained waiters,

busboys, and

diswashers, That year in high school competition I won 4

awards at the Slate Competitive event’s tourney, including

Food Service Math (3rd), Storytelling (3rd), Meal Service
,(an), 8t Sandwich Preparation (lst).

in the summer of ’74, while keeping my 'ob at the WSH, |

money I worked at our Food service plant as one of the

chefs.

Latimer

to run

by Jun Ncidcrbuch

In sharp contrast to the con-
troversy that plagued the Gi-iniiell
school system last Fall, appliance
shop owner Paul See races Tom
Latimcr, the director of
Recreational Facilities and Ser-
vices at Grinnell College, in a
relatively uncontroverstal Grinnell
school board election to be held
Tuesday, Scptember 14

The campaign lor the seat being
vacated by Jim MCNally has
pointed up ditterences in
qualiﬁcations rather than basic
philosophy between the two can-
didates. Latlmer stresses his long
involvement in civic and coins
munity affairs, and also his
professional training and ex
perience in working with young
people; See emphasizes his
background in business
management, the hiring and firing
of employees, and the tact that he
has taught commercial school,

Regarding issues, See declines to
recommend voter acceptance or
defeat of the school bond issue (to
finance construction of a new
junior high school in the south part
oi Grinnell t, while Latimer urges a
yes vote in the September 23th
vote,

The election is open to all voters
already registered in Grinnell:
polls are open from 7 am. until 9
pm. students who live on campus
vote at Bailey Park School ion
Eighth Slreet); others may
determine their polling place by
calling the school district at 235,

To the Editor:

The thin gag suiiered on Labor
Day (heh, lieh) by the le‘kle
sculpture on central campus was
certainly |ransparent, Ef nothing
else. That the act reflected a uni
sense or art and oi humor was
obvious. The duliards should note
that the sculpture lacks the
symmetry they ascribe to it, That
the act also showed striking
callousness toward the artist is a
development that all ot us should
regret. Gene G. Wuhhels
