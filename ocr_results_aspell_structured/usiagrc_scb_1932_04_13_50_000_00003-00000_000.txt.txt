Pushing across six runs in tho
final inning of its game with Dibble
hall. Rawson's team established itself
as a favorite to win the indoor base-
ball title by virtue of on 1177 t 'umpli
Saturday afternoon. The winning
team, led by its crack battery, Davi.
and Woody, played smart baseball

l3oth Phelps and Davis hurled good
hall for five innings, Rawson holding
a 1-0 lead at that time. Dibble scored
twice, only to have the opponents
chalk up a, 5‘2 margin in the first
of the sixth. Davis suffered his one
bad inning at this time, and Dibble
scored four runs to take the lead. In
the first of the seventh, the Rawson
men staged their rally, in which
\Voody's homer to left field provided
the margin of victory.

In the opening game of the schedr
ule, Clark hell defeated Longan, 9 to
2, in a listless game, in which Clark
held the upper hand throughout,
Bennett, Clark hurler, pitched good
hall and was hacked up by a strong
infield.

Gates downed Smith, 4 to 3, in the
final game of the day, smelscr, twirl-
ing for Gates, held the Smith batters
in check, while his mates overcame
an early lead. Gates pushed across
the winning run in the last half of
the seventh.

Clark at the top of the heap in the
scramble for the title.

‘Pilbr w, Champion Two-Miler, Ran

But One Race Before College Days

ack fans may have been surprise‘
cd when they saw littlc Mike Pilbrov ,
122 pounds of spring steel, steal the
honors from Clark Cliambcilain of
Michigan state in the two mile l'accl
at the central Intercollegiate indoor
meet this year. but they only had a
mild shock compared to that which
awaited those who knew Pllbrow in
his pl'e»collegicttc days.

The little Pioneer trackster cons
fesses that he ran one race before
coming to Grlnnellifm interclass haul
mile at his prep school, Morgan Pftl'k.l
With that for a start, he (lcvclopctll
into a distance performer whose time
of 9:242 at Notre Dame this year
not only tied the meet record, but was
only hettcrcd twice in the entire n3»
tion last season,

Two Times nettor

Chamberlain, who took second to
Pilbrow this season. turned in one
record of 9,7 last season and
Wright of Wisconsin was the only
other man in the country to better
the Grinnelliau’s time, doing the two
mile distance in 59:21.9.

The distance star began his car
here inauspiciously oltho he did
attract the attention of Coach Les
Duke when he went out for inLl'alIlul'~
al cross country as a freshman. The
mentor put him to work on the mile
during the indoor season when he
was a sophomore, his best time over
that distance last season being 4:34.

“on Conicrcncc Moot

When the outdoor season began,
the coach shifted him to two mile
competition whcie he placed in cvcry
meet in which he Compclctl, won the
conference meet and all of his dual
mcct races. His fastest performance
was a 9:41 at the Drake relays where
he placed fourth, and he ranked sixth
at the National collegiate meet.

This season, Pilhrow has won the
two mile run in every meet in which
he has competed and was pushed in
only oneithc Central Intercollegiate
affair At the quadrangle-r meet in
Iowa City Icccmly he ran the mile
in 4:24 and come back 40 minutes
later to show a 9 performance in
the two mile and win with 150 yards
Lo spare.

\i' tehcs Weatherman

The weatherman will have to he
considered when Pilhrow takes up his
work on the outdoor cinder path, for
his lack of weight makes it hard for
him to run in a wind or on a heavy
track. He is only 5 feet 6 inches tall
and the 122 pounds that he carries

, isn't much with which to buck heavy

wind opposition.

The little Pioneer has shown cons
sistent improvement, howeVer, already
bettering his best time of last season
by 17 seconds, and may be able to
show his heels to some more of the
nation's stars before the season
closes.
