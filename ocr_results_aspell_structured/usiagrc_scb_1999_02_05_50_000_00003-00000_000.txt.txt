Part I: lhe Ego of the Professor

it

When professors demand too miich,and
seem unable to understand the complexi-
ties of your life, do you ever contemplate
why? I do,

Professors live in their subject. We think
that because we are a major we live the
subject. We pale in comparison to our pro
fessors Professors having gone through un-
dergraduate and graduate studies, now
teach the subject all year, An obvious state-
ment, yet one that is often overlooked.

They teach three or {our classes in the
same subject, If We are true to the liberal
arts, we take one course in each division,
and maybe two in our major,

They construct lesson plans and grade
pnpers,tests.and portfolios for tens to hune
dreds of students.We write, study, and pre-
pare for each of four classes.

They skim the assigned readings.and pc-
ruse academic iournals.We might skim the
assigned readings and we deﬁnitely watch
the Simpsons.

Does this mean that professors are bet-
ter than us, and that we are slackers?

No. College is theirjob and with respect

BY EDWARD TEWS

to college, classes are their ﬁrst priority.
College is the experience I am living,antl
my first priority may or may not be my
classes,depentling on the moment.When
multiple assignments are due on the some

(late, all professors expect that their as-
signment Will take precedence. After all,
they live the classes,it is their ﬁrst prior-
ity It should be yours too. More often

than not,ncither ol'tlic proiccts appeals
to you and quality time with friends is
the order orthe day still,classos t tally
remain very high prior‘lllt’s for success
ful college students

The moral of the story is that when
multiple deadlines, or it Conﬂict or pri~
orities leads yotl not to choose a particue
lar professor‘s project as your primary
reason for living,tlon't level with the pro
ressor. Think about their perspective on
college and remember that their classes
are their first priority, they are not likely
to understand your perspective.

Many of you will undoubtedly feel
that this entire column has been com-
mon sense, However, many of us were
born without common sense or tact.
Speaking from experienceyou want to
think long and hard about being blunt
concerning your priorities, and I rind
that thinking about the professor ego,
or perspective, helps me to be more IIICI‘
ful,or at least it keeps my foot out of my
mouth.

Well, I am finally back at
school. I know Winter Break's five
Weeks was a long duration, You are
probably glad I am back at schoolpad
always said that “Vistors are like Ease
ter eggs: after three days, they begin
to stink.”

I'm not really sure whether that was
a comment on my hygenine or not.
Ever since Christmas,when I recicved
five sets of those trendy bath and body
soap sets with the little spongy things
in lhem,l have developed a little bit
ofa phobia...smelleaephobia However,
I went a tad bit overboard the other
dayWhile I was walking down the log-
gia, one of those au-natural hippy folks
kept sneezingFinally, she tapped me
from behind and asked if] could Walk
down wind from her. I guess the per
fume I had on was making her 5ick.At
least I hope it was the perfume.

Anyways,l know you think that real
life begins When the kids are in Cole
lege and the dogs are dead, but I think
it only begins when you visit Grinnell.
You see everything coniccturable
herejust imagine a place where no
one takes showers with out flip-
rlops.You can throw anything on the
floor and leave a huge trail of trash
behind you without worry, Housekeepv
ing will pick up after you. Here you can
break any glass door ofsomeone else's
dorm and they have to pay for it. On

OPINION

 

 

BY KATHRYN NONAS

campus, bikers have the right of way
and they have no speed limits. In fact,
a biker’s ultimate goal is to sneak up
behind you, yell to move over when
they are on your heels, and then force
you off the sidewalk into the snow.
In Grinnell. you can wear anything
you wzni,tncludtng a bikini in below-
freezing weather. Some people even
choose to not wear some clothing
(and I'm not talking about shoes).
The first-years are beginnihg to feel
comfortable in the presence of all the
topless people in Harris I told you
about. _

Sometimes I wonder if we are in
an alternate universe. I once saw a
man made hole with rocks in it. Some
magical force dedicated it to Smith
AnnCX, In fact, Smith was the same
location that I saw a ritual preformed.
A5 I was walking back from the li-
brary, several people gathered around
a burning object. I started to run
when they began dancing around it.
The scariest oddities are the Super-
heroes. I don’r believe they do
superheroish actionsﬂut they can be
relied on to find and irritate you any
where you try to hide from them dur-
ing finals.

In small ways, this college is like
any other: you can't escape those ire
titating people. I couldn't Wait to get
out of two of my classes last semese

[er because each one had a provokcr.
When I say “provoker,”l am talking
about those people everyone loves
to hateThey argue with the profese
sors about how accurate the lecture
is_. of course, they have to do this
during class, when the rest or us
Could be learning instead of listen-
ing to an argument that will be won
by the prof. (the provoker is in the
class to learn, not teach), Provokers
also include the kid that sits in the
front row and answers all of the
questions asked, whether their an-
swers are correct or not.This type
also likes to give a mini-lecture that
digresses completely off the subicct
when answering a question.You can
understand now why I was so ex-

Dear S and B editors,

I would like to state briefly my im-
pression orthe experience or being a
SGA Senator

First, being a senator is an 1111’
mense power trip. As a committee
member on SACC, I got first access to
the type or juicy gossip that the rest
of the college campus has to wait days
for. MathLAN got hacked? Cowles
clown for three days? There’s a com»
puter lab in Goodnow?

Besides these commlttee specific
pleasures, the tlllily enrichment lave
ished on my by my constituents is also
rewarding. Often addressed with the
lionoriric“senator",these
felloGrinnellldns tzllked to me about
vague and olten insolvable problems

By merely nodding and excreting a
Soft “hmmmm. they assume I value
their experiences both as a student
and 215:IconspecificJByiust mention-

ing their concerns on Wednesday, I
am later further recompensed with
thanks for even this simple task.

While up to this point,l have kept
my constituents in the dark about the
ease of being a senator, often mum-
bling about the convoluted concerns
of“selfegovernance“,it is time I came
clean,

While in the past, through strate-
gic limitation and editing orthejoint
Board minutes, I have been able to
improve my status — no more.

In the interests of the entire cam-
pus, here me say ‘Being a Hall Sena»
tor is easier than falling off a log".
Even a small log. I hope that I can
continue this next semester to serve
Langan Hall and that others also be-
come interested in joining the SGA
family.

Quote of the Week

 

classl didn't know what I was get»
ting into. Last Monday, I walked into
my first class only to discover that
both provokers were sitting in the
front row, right next to each other.
It seemed very fitting. It made me
realize that there are other less ob~
vious lessons that We are here to
learn. One is patience,

Love,

“When you walk in and say good morning, and they say good
morning back, it‘s freshmen. When they put their newspaper
down and open their books, it's sophomores. When they look
up so they can see the instructor over the tops of the
newspapers, it‘s juniors When they put their feet up On the
desks and keep reading, it‘s seniors."
