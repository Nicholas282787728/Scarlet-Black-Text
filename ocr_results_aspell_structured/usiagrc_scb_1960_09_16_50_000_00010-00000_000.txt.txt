India is a thrilling place right
nowslt is like the America of

to build a great new land. To»
day we America s Often thinlr
that we have ai local and can
now enjoy the trolls of our
Toretathers' labors. We must
broaden ourrhorizons, find the
true nature of today's challenge
and see.that we can ﬁnd a
much greater purpose than what
they had.

Our‘purpose B" to build a [
tree world, Our challenge can
be tound in Vice-President
Nixon's words,“W}len Khruslv ‘
chev says our grandchildren ‘
shall live under communism, ‘
let us say that his grandchild. l
ren shall live under ireedoni," l

From this side or the \vorld‘
this challenge does not seeinl
too great. However, itwill :11va
er be met by building more
1Bombs and missiles: If it is to
be met, the masses and their
