Baseball Prospects.

gins to line up.
for places will be keen, and with
four vacancies to ﬁll, the best
work must be done by all.

With the old men in school, the
nucleus ot a strong team is at
hand. as the old men are all good
batters and clever ﬁeldel‘s. Tait,
as catcher, has established him»
self as one of the best college
players in the country. His hack-
stop work is sure and his base
throwing fast and accurate.

Clark, in the pitcher’s position,
is one of the fastest and headiest
men Grinnell has had for some
years, and was the best of last
year's pitching staff. He is also
a clever ﬁelder, and at third base
is fast and accurate.

Fiske and Lindsay, at short and
second, respectively, cover their
positions well. Both are steady.
consistent players, although both
are inclined to loaf at times.

Doe, in the outﬁeld, is the only
one left of a trio of exceptionally
fast ﬁelders. Doc isa good in
ﬁelder and may be called upon to
cover the third bag. With coach-
ing, he will also make a good
pitcher to relieve Clark.

New material is abundant, and
many show promise of doing good
work. Winsett, Halsey and Dalil-
gren will try for the vacant posi-
tion at ﬁrst base. The two ﬁrst
named were substitutes last year
and both did good work. Throwr
ing is a weak point with both,
while each is a fair batter. Dahlr
gren hails lrom Newton and played
good ball on the town team there.

Schilling, Marsh and Manatt
are new men, who have shown

 

themselves very clever and will
probably make tlte contest for in-
ﬁeld positions very close

Thompson, McCord. Filmore.
Eldridge. Evans and Finley have
been doing good work in the out-
ﬁeld and with a little expcricnce
will make valuable melt. There
are many more players in school
who have shown marltcd ability
in baseball, and it Grilinell is to
have a good team, they owe it to
the school to don suits and come
out at once. As In former yeals,
we have a place (or every man
who has ever played baseball, and
all are certain to he givenan equal
chance for every position.

Miss Price isexpectcd home this
month. She has just completed a
touramotiglhcuiiivcrsitics otEngr
land, Scotland and Ireland, where
she has beenstudyingthe christian
work among the college women.
Miss Piice sailed from Queens
town on the Lucaliia, February 24.

Now that the new association
year is soon to begin when the
newly elected oFFlcers take their
places, a suggestion that the asso
ciation emphasize systematic and
businesslike ways in all its work
will not come amiss.

Syracuse University has an oak
cabinet which stands in the asso»
ciation room and is composed ot
iilteen drawers. Every orncer and
chairman has a drawer in which
she keeps all records and papers
connected with her work. She
also has a good blank book so that
reports may be nicely kept. Thus
each set or oFﬁcers can proﬁt trom
the experience or their predeces-
sors. There is also asummer con-
terelice drawer, with helpful sug-

gestions from delegates. Also a
ﬁle of Emugrzr is kept for refers
EDGE.
