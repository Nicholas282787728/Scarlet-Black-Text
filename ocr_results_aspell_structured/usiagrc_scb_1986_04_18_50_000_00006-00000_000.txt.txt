Libya
A prudent response

During times of world crisis, there is a
natural tendency ior passions to hinder
reasoning. The response displayed to the
recent U.S. raid on Libyan terrorist camps
is one Such example.

While there has been much discussion of
the immorality oi the US, action, many
have overlooked both the raids instigating
causes and the enormous prudence oi the
U.S. response, When discussing interna-
tional politics, one must adopt a different
language and reasoning than that which is
used in domestic affairs, Precedent and
context provide the basis ior moral judge
merit in international affairs, The morality
of any act in the international arena should
be based upon a respect for world order
and responsible conduct. ..

Libya's persistent sovereign support of
terrorist aggression display a complete
disregard ior any conventions oi interna
tional morality. The Libyan government
continues to employ its diplomatic
facilities as operating bases for terrorists

In the fall of 1984 a British policewoman
was gunned down by a sniper housed in
Libya‘s embassy to Britain U.S. in-
telligence sources and government otr
iicials (including prominent liberal
spokesmen such as Senator Patrick
Moynihan and Robert Byrd) have affirm-
ed that the Libyan consulate in East Berlin
was used as the base (or last week's attack
in Berlin. Among other suggested ex-
amples oi Libyan support ior terrorist
atrocities are the coordinated holiday at
tacks on airports in Rome and vienna.

Libya has housed training bases on its
African soil as well At these bases. terr
rorists develop the skills to practice their
crait with Libya-supplied arms, They are
trained to be eluswe. The best efforts oi
Western intelligence cannot counter the
enormous asset of Consistent resources
and a stable base of operation for terrorist
activity Terrorists can slip back to Libyan
sanctuaries,

Libyan-sponsored terrorism has a dil-
terent moral status than transnational ter-
rorism. While transnational terrorist
organizations such as The Red Brigade act
outside of the international system. state
sponsored terrorism clearly represents an
act oi sovereign aggression within the
system When a state apparatus publicly
supports acts of aggression against other
states and innocent civilians, that state is
engaging in the moral equivalent of war,

Responses to state sponsored terrorism. .

then, should address the aggressor state,
victims of aggression possess a limited

number or options in response‘ diplomatlc'

solution, political/economic sanction, and
military response. U.S. policy toward
Libya has demonstrated remarkable
restraint in choosing to exercise non-
Violent options.

Diplomatic attempts. however. have
been ineiiectual. The Libyan leadership
has continually failed to respect promises
or agreements, Economic/political sane
tlons. furthermore, did little to deter Lia
byan aggression,

in selecting the military option, the U.S.
has followed respected norms of retaliar
tion. The possibility or a US, response in
the face of Continued aggression was clear
iy displayed in the weeks beiore the at
tack. Unlike the terrorists, the U.S. raid
demonstrated responsible planning and
execution, All targets were closely related
to terrorist support activities, The US, did
not target civilian areas, Furthermore, the
U S, did not act until it possessed con-
clusive evidence oi Libyan support ior the
West Berlin bombing.

Because Libya has sponsored terrorist
activity against innocent civilians and pro-
perty, it can be properly considered an agr

gressor nation. The United States pursued
a military course as a prudent and effec-
tive response to statersponsored terr
rorism The establishment oi this prece-
dent may deter more rational actors irom
testing the balance oi power. 7 David

The grand irony

To the Editor,

I am writing this on Tuesday, April 15th,
1986, an ironic day in which a set oi con-
nected events are occurring. The us.
House of Representatives is scheduled to
vote on‘Aid to the Contras at this very mo-
ment, The U.S. invaded/bombed military
and civilian populations in Libya early this
morning (6 pm. Monday Iowa time). And
lastly, today is the day all us citizeiis'
taxes are due.

One thing I think is ironic about the bom-
bing oi Libya is that we are crossing the
border into another nation. murdering
civilians and soldiers, blowing up military
and non-military targets. and attacking
the family of that nation’s leader, all for
the sake of stopping terrorism. This is not
simply the kettle calling the teapot black.
it is the Nazi calling the Jew a fascist, it is
the bully calling the beaten one a punk and
claiming self-defense.

As of the latest reports I have heard. our
government's invasion caused the deaths
of an unspecified amount of civilians and
military people, the death or the 15 month
old daughter oi Khaddal‘y and serious iris
juries to two oi his sons, and the partial
destruction of the French Embassy and a
non-military hospital in addition to
destruction oi military targets. This sort oi
destruction and murder is supposedly
what our government stands against.

One thing that is even more “ironic" is
that the air attack on Libya occurred on
the eve of the Contra Aid vote. Even our
Republican congressman. Cooper Evans.
commented “My intuition tells me the
precise timing was inlluenced by the cons
tra vote." (Something that was equally
“ironic" was the revelation from the White
llouse on the eve oi the previous Senate
contra vote that Nicaragua had "invaded
Honduras "t

The decision by the Reagan Administrar
tion was made with the approval oi many
in the House and Senate and of course the
Pentagon people, who haven't had so much
run since Grenada it is most likely a poor
movc as far as Uiiitcd States stratcgic
global policy is concerned. mainly because
we have unlflcd the Aral) (and “Third"l
\i'orld against us and proven oursclves to
bc "Yankee Imperialists" at a time when
imperialist oppression is not being
tolerated, The people oi South Korea.
South Africa. Chile, and El Salvador are
realizing that their struggles are not being
prolonged because oi the popularity oi
their oppressive governments, but
because oi the military aid and support
from the United States.

But "our" strategic interests don't in-
terest me, Whose interests are they
anyway? Not mine; i ieei no real need to
have my nation in 'ntain its position as
numero urlo militaristcxpansionist on this
planet. This does not give me a warm
cheery reeling in my heart. But I suppose
that is my bias e I don't get off on the
macho patriarchal World domination
scene, it turns mc pit and turns my
stomach. th i pay ior it with my taxes.

sion/bombing/covert war business (ill

democracy, yeahl will backiire interna-
tionally. Not only is it likely to make the
world less amenable to the US. tourism
and Grinnell alumni tours, it is likely to in-
crease the popularity oi militarists like
Khaddai‘y who oppose our own crazed
militarism, The Arab people and the Lie
byans are supporting Khaddafy now more
than ever!

on the other hand We have Reagan. who
has dubbed himself “a Contra”, and who
thinks that the Contras are much like “our
founding fathers ” I don't know. maybe
I'm wrong, but i don't remember reading
in high school about "our founding
fathers" invading a country with a popular
government. relying on external funding,
killing Innocent civilians. burning fields.
schools. and health care facilities, and rap
ing. torturing, mutilating. and murdering
hundreds of human beings America's
Watch, as well as Amnesty international
and several recent books have
documented a multitude of incredible
hulnan rights violations by the Contras. I
guess President Reagan is in a sense the
Supreme International Contra, ior as
leader of the misguided government of this
nation. he has taken responsibility ior the
continuance oi rape. murder. and torture
throughout the world.

So i guess the grand irony oi April is.
1936. is that Reagan is aiding the Contras
to promote democracy and bombing Libya
to stop terrorism, and the jokes on us,

Damaging US.
interest

After hearing about the us bombing oi
Libya l am very unsatisfied with the
reasons why bombing was the action taken
and I am worried about where this action
might lead to. These are the questions and
concerns that I have:

1. Was bombing Libya the best action to
take? I have serious doubls on this issue, If
the United States Wanted to take a Sland
against terrorism it should not have at
tacked Libya or have bombed Libya When
the United States takes military action to
try to to thwart Khadnly it is only playing
Khadaiy's game oi guns instead oi using
diplomacy to properly and promptly rid
him oi power.

2. is the use or military action ace
complishing the U 3 goal oi stopping tcrr
rorism" All military action so far has only
put Khadafy in the limelight and increased
his power. u.s. military action has tailed
this objective

3. How long can thc us use military
power against Khadaiy beiore entering
war” President Reagan warns that further
military action will be taken it Khadafy
does not stop his terrorism Each military
action has gotten progressively more ag-
gressive, In light oi thcsc iacts I tear that a
war would be started unless Khadai‘y
agrees to stop soon which i highly doubt
since all U.S. military action has only in-
crcased his power.

a, How extensively can the U.S. usc
military actions without overstepping its
rights This is very nebulous but many
countries believe the U S, is being too
pushy and if this is the case future U.S. in-
fluence could be severely damaged.

I don't believe we were justified in using
military action against Libya and I cer
tainly hope that we stop using military ac
tion against Libya. Continuing U S.
military action would only damage
American interests Julic Huddle

Gay Resource
Center

This is a copy oi a letter that i sent to
President George Drake and Jim Tederr
man concerning the proposed Gay
Resource Center:

“I, like many people on campus, have
been giving a considerable amount oi at-
tention to the proposal ior a resource
center tor the gay community on campus
Along with this attention. much considera-
tion has been given to the Validity of beliefs
not only tor the proposal, but also belieis
against the proposal. The purpose of this
letter is not to sway your view, but to pre-
sent my view as a student oi Grinnell.

Aitcr thinking out the various opinions l
have been confronted with. Ithink it is best
for the Grinnell College community to call
this resource center the Gay Resource
Center. and not one of the other names that
have been suggested, The basis ior this
decision comes from an assortment of difr
fering beliefs that I have.

The most important iactor behind my
decision in having the word "GAY" in the
name of the resource center is recognition
oi the gay community as a valid minority
on campus To me, it seems odd that for a
minority as large as the gay population is
a t Grinnell, that it is not highly recognized
as a viable minority by the campus as a
w hole 7 both students and administrators.
I realize there is G C.G.C,. but it is a sup
port group that meets once a week in one
room.

iiind it disappointing that the gay com-
munity does not have a permanent place oi
their own to meet ior support for more
than just a couple or hours per week lieel
that there is a real need to allocate a per-
manent place. not just for gays. but for
anyone on campus that might have ques-
tions concerning what "being gay” entails.

By creating the Gay Resource Center.
the college is signiiying that gay people on
campus are a valid minority group with
differing needs than those of other minorir
ty groups on campus

Being a freshman. I do not know Why the
Black Cultural Center was created. but I
uould guess that it vias created because
the black Community felt that their needs
werc not being nici adequately, and to
meet these needs the Black Cultural
Center was established Now such needs
exist again. and I believe the Center is a
viable way to meet these needs.

Another problem I considered was the
illcluston of other groups in the center. and
perhaps making it the Human Resource
Center
