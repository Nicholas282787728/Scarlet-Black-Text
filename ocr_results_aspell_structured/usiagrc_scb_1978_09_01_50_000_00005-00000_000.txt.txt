Crisis in the closet

The gay community at Grinnell ,

College, and elsewhere, is facing a
serious Crisis.

Due perhaps to thc complacency
and apathy which have been
waxing since the early '70's, the
gay community at Grinnell has
been shrinking annually. I believe,
for a number oi reasons, that this
attrition reflects an increase in the
closet population rather than an
actual change in the
population. This reduces gay
visibility, and the absence of a
visible gay community isolates
those students in the process oi
“coming out or the closet,"

Without support from a group or
individual. and without any
positive role models, a student is
likely to keep hlsher teelings lrom
himrherseli andror others, This
turther decreases gay visibility.
and we appear to have a vicious
circle-feedback loop situation,
While this is an admittedly subr
jective explanation for the present
circumstances of the gay com-
munity here, it is of less im-
portance now to assess how we got
here than it is to determine what to
do next.

WITH THE ,\I)\'I“..\'l' of the
Anita Bryant "Save Our Children”
campaign, this problem has risen

rto critical importance Riding on

the wave of the liberation
movements at the 'tio's, the gay
movement had achieved major
successes in the tom of equal

However, these Vlctorlcs have
been all but eradicated by the
”Save Our Children" campaign.

Grinnellians love to generalize,

there is nothing wrong with
generalizing. Fact: it your

better sense of Grinnell, they're all
right by me.

Fact: all of the above [acts could
be regarded as generalizations,
Fact: anybody viewing this tact,

generalization may be regarded as

Letters to the editor
Change bathroom policy

To the editor: Boy. am I iiiadl,
Here it is. I thoughtl “as coming
to a really cool progressive school
but I find its all a [area

You see, my hall had its
bathroom vote a iew days ago and
we tor i should say two or three
people) decided that we should
have slnglcrscx bathrooms. Well,
that's freshmen, i suppose, They
don't realize that cored bathrooms
don‘t mean shower orgies or
mazola parties at the sink Coed
bathrooms tJust like at home) are
quite feasible and work with no
major problems

But back to my original
statement-boy, I'm still mad! Not
so much because I have to walk
three flights of stairs to take a
shower (and if walking that far in
nothing but a towel is any torm of
privacy. I'm amazed) but because
a pertectly reasonable bathroom
policy drawn up by SGA was
vetoed by President Turner in
tavor of the present unrair system

Last year after SGA discussed
the bathroom policy they sent
Turner a proposal to make all Co-
ed floor bathrooms dialrzlrjohns
All right. so it sounds silly and
trivial but in tact it's really a good
idea Well, guess who vetoed lti
good old ART. As it now stands, for
a lloor to have coed bathrooms.
the vote has to be unanlmo ‘.

I think it's about time Grinnell
and SGA came up with a new
lavatorv polle Why not com
promise? If Turner won‘t accept
the dial-a-john proposal, at 'least
the voting procedure should be
Changed. When you figure that one
person can control the bodily
tunctions ot two tloors or people (it
he or she votcs no, then not only
does his or her lloor become single-
scx. but so does the floor above or
below—to accommodate the other
sex), it becomes ridiculous As
many as 40 people can be involved.

A majority vote should be required
to make bathrooms singlesex.

Well. thanks tor letting me get
this all my chest, I'd have written a
longer letter, but I think I might
have to Ilse the tacilities soon, and
it's such along walk up those tllrcc
tliglits ot stairs, I've got to get an
early start it i don't want to have
