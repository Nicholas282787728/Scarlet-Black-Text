the life

Tuesday September 23, 2003
5:22 am. Alarm goes off, get
up, get dressed, Sletch in
preparation for tennis
(twenty years ago. when I
started playing tennis twice
a week at 6 a.m., I used to
be able to get up at 5:50,
get dressed and play at 5. As i get older, I require
more stretching time). Ride bike to PE.
5:00 Play doubles with three other early-rising tennis
enthusiasts: doctor, minister, German professor (sounds
like the setup for a joke). I play badly. Serve works, but
feet refuse to get set for forehand; feet seem to think that
forehand can hit by itself. Hit forehand into net. Again
and again.
7:00 Having lost first set badly but partially redeemed self
in second Set, shake hands all around with enthusiasts;
head home for shower, dressing and oatmeal nuked with
blueberries, soy milk, dried cherries and cranberries and
almonds. Trying to include all the cholesterol-lowering
ingredients at once.
7:135 Head off on bike to ARH; look over transparencies for
presentation; have momentary panic concerning AV
equipment in room.
3:20 Begin presentation on academic honesty for a
tutorial. Feel like a cross between a stand-up comic, a
hellfire and brimstone preacher and a sympathetic wnting
teacher.
9:15 Back to Writing Lab: Check email; talk to office
manager about trafﬁc for today; make agendas for staff
meeting.
10:00 Meet with student who signed up for College
Writing 100 just before the deadline. She has paper she
needs to talk about; make suggestions about torrent paper
while trying to make her comfortable about coming to lab.
11:00 Staff meeting. Consult fellow Writing Lah folks
about registrations, office managers. We discuss article
entitled "The Responsible Plagiarist," which argues that
even students who are trying to be very responsible about
their writing may inadvertently plegiarize. 0ne staff
member brings up a recent situation where she suspected
that the student was too close to the wording of the
source. We all discuss what to'do in such a case. End up
thinking what a neat bunch of people 1 work with.
12:00 Ride bike home for lunch; collaborate with son on
crossword puzzle; channel Surf between ”Sportscentel" and
”Law and Order;" do bills.
1:00 Back to work. Work with student on history paper.
2:15 See a for-credit student, working on religion paper.
We get silly and laugh a lot.
3:15 Student brings in methods section of a biology paper,
i can't understand what the paper is saying. my to get
student to explain what‘s happening in experiment: she is
able to explain to me what the lab is and why they are
doing speciﬁc steps, but her writing is not conveying that
idea. Suggest ivays she might proceed; suggest she talk to
professorr Meanwhile, I retordcverbatim her explanations
to me, hope that helps her.
4:15 Attend faculty colloquium on advising and
mentoring. Good discussion about how faculty can offer
advice for mentoring to students Husband Chris and his
colleague Kent complain about the space limitations faced
by social studies faculty. I note out loud how grumpy the
sociologists are. Immediately realize that] shouldn’t have
said that.
5:105 Ride bikes home with Chris. Discuss fiercely what to
have for dinner. End up nuking leftover soup from
weekend, and heat up frozen organic pizza (ugh). While
eating soup and pizza, watch ”Simpsons" on TV and read
packet for tomorrow night's school board meeting.

“deceptively

When a sportswriter and self—confessed
