Lacking distinct boundaries and
an information flow, some
members of the Curriculum
Committee. Executive Council.
and Long Range Planning Com
mittee have agreed that problems
exist in the structure, functions,
and effectiveness of these com-
mittees.

In the spring of 1974, the
Curriculum and LongsRange
Committees were created by the
faculty to relieve the work load of
the Executive Council, explained
Arnold Adelberg, taculty chair-
man. The Executive Council,
whose key duties include dealing
with administrative and
educational matters, which the
President Wishes to put before it,
and bringing such matters to the
President’s attention, also was
responsible at that time ior
overseeing the curriculum, long-
range planning, and personnel
deciSlons. The council often
became burdened with the work
load, particularly in the spring
when a great deal of council time
was spent on personnel decisions,
Adelberg explained.

Now, though, the ”relief”
committees appear to be
developing their own problems.
The chairmen of these Committees
have sat down with the ad-
ministration to discuss the illsyof
their committees. Adelberg hopes
the cures for those ills will come
from the Faculty Organization
Committee, headed by Phillip
Kintner.

The Curriculum Committee,
composed of one elected
representative from each or the
four academic divisions and four
elected students, the faculty
chairman, and the curriculum
dean, has essentially the same
mandate as the Executive Council.
said Donald Irving, committee
chairman. Irving said that the
mandate for his committee is the
immediate oversight of the
educational program of the
college. At the same time,
however, the Executive Council is
charged also with overseeing the

curriculum, Irving said.

The Executive Council, which
Adelberg said should be viewed as
the personnel board, otten affects
the Curriculum more than the
curriculum committee, said Irving
and Adelberg. Dean Eysenbach
explained that when any personnel
decisions are made, those
decisions affect the curriculum,
Curricular decisxons also can afs
feet personnel. However, in the
past, it has been the personnel
decisions which have affected the
curriculum

Irene Jones, Executive Council
member, sees the work of the
Curriculum Committee “as largely
the registrar’s kind oi work,"
because of the functions it has
served, such as reVlewlng course
proposals, numbering courses. and
looklng at prerequisites. These
functions are an “enormous drain
at time with no major rewards."

The “incredible" amount of
paper work is wasted faculty ef-
fort, Jones said, especially when
that work is a repeat of previous
critical study completed by
departments on such items as
course proposals. Few proposals in
the science division have ever been
turned down, Jones said,

Agreeing with Adelberg, Jones
said that the curriculum com-
mittee is not and will not be a new
ground for spawning ideas. Ideas
come from faculty, she said.

As chairman, lrving believes the
committee should do more than act
on course proposals and number
courses. Irving recommends that
the committee think In larger
contexts. such as the meaning of
general education to the major.

President Turner, Dean Walker.
and Dean Eysenbach recognize the
difficulty in the overlapping
mandate ol the two bodles, but
none are sure how to solve the
dilemma. “It is impossible to plan,
if you separate the curriculum
from the nature and function of the
statf," Turner said.

The Long-range Planning
Committee has more “internal“
problems than the curriculum
committee, said Adelberg, Not

Well deﬁned," Adelberg said, but it
also has a large number of
members who serve on various
other committees with more
pressing concerns. Tile committee
includes the dean of the college, the
faculty chairman, the vice
president of development, three .
elected faculty and two students
appointed by the president The
dean, chairman, and vice
president serve on many other
committees simultaneously.

Eysenbach isn't sure that the
committee structure is able to
handle the idea of long-range
planning. A committee is best
where repetitive sorts oi problems
occur, like personnel, the dean
said. However, she explained that
long-range problems are more
unique and nonrepctitive,

Better long-range planning
would result from use at an ad hoc
committee and interested people,
Eysenhach believes, Longsrange
requires more of a “think tank"
than a committee, the dean said,

Though it was created to be the
“superpower,” the LongsRange
Committee never achieved such
stature, both Turner and Adelberg
commented. The long»range
concept is not “tenable” separated
from the council, Adelberg said.
The Council has to change to be
able to accomplish long-range
planning, the raculty chairman
said.

Placing longsrange planning into
a subcommittee of the Executive
Council might not help either,
Adelberg speculated. li a sub-
committee was formed, a problem
with student representation arises,
since students are not allowed to sit

on the Executive Council, Adelbere Q

responded to thls problem. saying
that students were helpful but not
necessary to longsrange planning.

Irving outlined three possibilities
lor remedying the problems in the \
three committees. One possibility
would be to eliminate long-range
and curriculum, merging their
duties back into the Executlve
Council. lrving's second idea was
to place all the work with the
curriculum committee including
personnel. He admitted, though,
that this was not practicable or
desirable because it would cut out
student representation ii personnel
were considered. Lastly, Irving‘v
suggested a compromise which
would be to separate the duties of
the three groups and redefine their
mandates.
