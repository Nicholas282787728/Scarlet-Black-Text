Healthcare Reform
cares for students

While there are many opinions about the effect otrhe new
healthcare overhaul, there is one group that greatly beneﬁted
when President Ohama signed the Healthcire Reform legisla-
tion into law on March 23~college students

There are several aspects of the bill that not only improve
the health insurance situation {or students but also alleviate the
strain of rising college costs.

Formerly, students were dropped from their parents’ health
insurance plluls at the age of 13 unless they were continuing
their education. Upon graduating from college, those students
would rhen lose their coverage, leaving them to not only pay for
things such as graduate school and possible relocation costs but
their insurance costs as well.

Starting in August, regardless ofenrollment in higher edu-
cation or marital status, people will be able to stay on their par-
enrs' health insurance plans until the age of26.

This new law will allow Grinnellians greater freedom in
choosing what to do after college, With the economy still re
covering, the partial relief of a large financial burden is cruv
cial for many students still looking for employment, Further,
students interested in doing service work after college will no
longer be burdened with unaffordable insurance costs.

In addition to the health care beneﬁts, the overhaul also
contains the Student/it'dnndFilmanpnnrilli/t'lyAri, which will
alter how students receive their aid and the amount and time
period that accompany the aid,

First, student loans will no longer come through banks. In
stead, starting july 1, 2010, students will receive grants directly

from the government, which allows the government to lower
certain restrictions. The window for repaying loans will now be
lowered from 25 yours to 20, with loans being forgiving there
after. a

Also, starring luly 1. 2014, monthly wincuts on student
loans will he lowered to 10 percent of discretionary income
from the current 15 percent. Unfortunately for many of us, this
only applies to loans taken lifter the date, but prospective stu~
dents coming to Grinnell can look forward to saving a greater
amount ofrheir income post—graduation.

Most importantly, the maximum Pell Grant will increase
from the current $5,550 to 35,900, allowing more low and
middlerincomc Americans to attend collegc.

Thar being said, the actual cost ofthc legislation will not be
known for a long time, so while projections show a reduction
of the deﬁcit, many are afraid that our generation will . .
have to pay for this legislation later. '

So while the wrdict is still out on the over-
all effects of the bill, it appears that college-aged
Americans will now be able to save on costs and
have greater choice in following their career
paths—a welcome relief to the world of rising
college costs and uncertainty
