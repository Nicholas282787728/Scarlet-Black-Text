smashing victory oier a iolll‘rmiln
team representing Amcs. The Grirr
nell players won er match with
little difficulty, and iii ohlv one set
did Ames bring the play into extra
games

Nitoler. and struble had an easy
time with their matches at the Corin-
try clulkconrts. Nicolet romped over
Leach, 670, 672, for a lopsided victory,
while Struhle, witlront even taking off
his sweat shirt, was handing Robert;
son a s , e-o trimming, Both men
played a steady. back ocurt game, and
were not forced to extend themselves,

Wind Fathers

In the first doubles match of the
meet, Struble and Nicolet paired to
win easily from Robertson and Leach,
Geo, 6-3. The players were bothered
considerably by the high wind that
blew across the courts, Doc Somers
and Harris Coggeshall officiated at
these matches,

At the women’s tennis courts, smiley,
playing his first varsity match, play-
ed a fine stroking game to heat Shoee
maker of the Aggies, 6-3, 3-2. Stotts
had little trouble with Learnicker,
and won 6-2. 6-3. largely through his
deadly game at the net.

sity competition for the first time. had
a reel battle with the second Ames
doubles team, but came through with
a 6-2, 10-3 win. The Ames men. Shoee
maker and Leamioker, prrt up a fine
brand of tennis in the second set,
brought the ganres to deuce four times,
but did not’ have quite the stuff to
push accross a win. Grinnell was
again helped in this match by Stotts'
fine playing at the net. Hubert Lewis
officiated at these matches.

The meet attracted a large‘ nnm~
ber of tennis enthusiasts. The Grin-
nell tennis team, which is coached by
W. Earl Beem. showed strength in all

Burlingame and Smith
Speak at Coe Chapel

Russell smith and Robert Burlih»
game spoke ‘to a student chapel Frr
day morning at Coe college as student
representatives from Grinnell college
on the subject “What is wrong with
the American colleges today?”

lThe two men were invited to speak
before the student body on this sub-
ject in connecuon with a movement to
try to find the fallacies in our modern‘
colleges and universities. The Coo
student committee in charge of this
has made a practice of inviting two
speakers lrom various colleges at in
tervais of every two weeks. Thus far
the speeches have been to the point
and have materially aided the Coe
men in their effort to seek the under-
lying causes.

Burlingame , also on the affirmative
side of the question and attempted ‘Lo
show that there were certain things
wrong with colleges that should he
changed quickly. Smith took the otllr
er side of the question and answered
Burlingame's arguments. After the
speeche, an open forum w shcld and
the Griunell men answered a number
of questions put' to them from the and-
ience.

It is probable that on their return
to Grinnell these men will have somce
thing to say in regard to the practice
of holding student chapels on a re-
search question.

RINEFORT TO RUN DASHES

Slight \Villll From South Is meted
To Cut Donn Time In Dashes At
This Uterlwoll’s Heel;

Grinuell's chances for a victory
over the Drake track team received
some sorious inst miurrte blows when
it was found that Scharnwcber. Niblo,
Bender. and Hoffman could not come
pate, '

sharnueher has been slowed rrp all
season by his old lameness and it was
rrundvisnhle 'for him to run in the
dashes this afternoon, This leaves
the Scarlet and Black with only Kine-
fort and Talbott as entries in the short
races to meet Dustin, Fry and Tolles
of the Bulldogs.

Nilylo Out

Niblo was ruled out at the last min-
ute because of scholastic difficulties
and his loss means much in the hur-
dles and the high jump. However.
Wendell Davis will be available for
the hurdles and the discus throw. and
should be able to add some points to
the Grinnell total.

Hoffman, fast middle distance man,
is also ineligible and will bc lost to
the relay teams. Bender, winner of
the pole vault in the home meet last
week, was also victim of the profs and
must watch ‘the meet from the stands.

Slight Wind

At starting time for the afternoon
program there was a slight wind blow—
ing up the home stretch, which was
expected to cut down the time on most
of the performances. The track was
fast and shorrld partly compensate for
the zephyrs from the south.
