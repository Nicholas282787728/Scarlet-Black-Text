REALLY ii DISGR ACE

Coe college at Cedar Rapids, has shown us how much a com-
paratively small college can make of its bbnd. Coc has sent its boon
to Washington, D. C., for the presidential inaugural for the last sev-
eral times, and this month the band will make the trip again To
participate in such an event, a hand must be good; and Grinncll
could well profit by the example Coe has set in this instance.

There is no reason at all—with the capable instructor that we
have, and with the number of students on this campus who play
band instrumenlsiwhy Grinnell can not enlarge and improve its
band so that it will make a favorable showing wrth Coe's.

That there should be so few members of the band is almost a
disgrace to our traditional Grinnell school spirit; everyone who plays
an instrument should join our band and make it a band Grinnell
College can really be proud of. .

GRINNELL ADVANCES

Recently Howard Vincent O'Brien of the Chicago Daily News
made several observatiods in his column, “All Things Considered,"
which might be particularly interesting to Grinnellians, many of
whom are hunting jdbS,

He pointed out in the first place that the demand for technically
skilled men is increasing, and in many lines of work it exceeds the
supply. Furthermore, that there has been very little headway made
in bridging the period between college and gainful occupation, for in
the majority of cases the process of connecting a man just cut of
school with a job is still largely accidental and that too few educa-
tional institutions recognize the fact that their responsibility to their
students does not cease with graduation, and still fewer are making
successful attacks on the problem of employment.

Grinnell can well point with pride to its year-old institution of
vocations classes which last year proved to be a successful medium
through which our students might make favorable attacks on the
problems of hunting and finding the right job.

We appreciate the time and interest faculty members and the
administrative personnel of the college are giving to this compara-
tively new project and we ask for continued cooperation for the v0»
cations class of 1937.

COLLEGE STUDENTS ACHIEVE LITTLE SUCCESS

Just a little more than curious, a Harvard graduate of 1911
recently sent questionnaires to 620 members of his class.

0f the 547 who answered the questionaire, 23 are in “Who's
Who." Eighteen volumes of poetry were written by the class, 14
of which were the works of one man. Six novels were produced,
three by the same author. And out of the entire 547 there was
not a single congressman, governor, state legislator or mayor:

Hcre, then, is an example of the American system of educa»
tion. It shows beyond any doubt that no matter how much money
is spent, if the individual does not give everything he has, he
won't get much results. Public school teachers shout about
“Worthy use of leisure time" without realizing that for the ambi-
tious, the energetic student there is no leisure time. In regard to
the rest of those attending school, It's not leisure time but loafing
time.

How many of today's college graduates will find their names
in “Who's Who” 30 years from now? or vn'll their education
serve them but one purpose—to give them a feeling of superiority
over those who never went to such-and-such a school, and who,
for perhaps that very reason, tried much harder, achieved more
things?

‘Magnificent, Stimulating’

‘Presentation Last Night

Shows True Artistry
of Players

iiy RICH RD iiUNCL

A program of magnificent and
stimulating music was presented
last night in Herrick chapcl by
Elsie Haggard Ryan, pianist, and
Elias Blum, organist. Both artists

their work tog-ether, as well as in
their solo performances Then-
phrasing, interpretation, technique,
and quite evident thorough knowlr
edge of their selections can be flat
scribed only hy the use of sllpel
tivcs,

The first group, for piano and
organ, was stately and solemn in
general effect. “Morgeng‘ebet” by

Haydn gave a ceremonious open-,

ing to the program, Beethoveirs
"Largo" was moving in its differ
ent moods, and thoroughly folr
lowed the impressive vein of the
group. Handel’s “Passacaglia in
G Minor" was splendid in its difr
fcrcnt minute shades of inter-pre-
tation. The answering motifs by
first, the piano, and then the cr-
gan, compelled the closc attention
and interest of the audience; the
spontaneous applause which for
lowed evidenced its popularity.
Delicate Loveliness

Boellman's “Suite Gothique,”
presented by Mr. Blum as an era
gan solo, placed the audience in an
atmosphere of delicate loveliness
by its first two movements. The
“Pl'iere a NotreDame” could
have gone on indefinitely in its
melodic beauty. The organ reg’i5r
tration fitted its mood perfectly.
The third movement progressed
quickly, and was in direct con-
trast to the other parts of the
suite...quietly emotional at first,
then graduating to a big, drama—
tic climax, and finally ending- with
a majestic major chord The lis-
teners were obviously wcil pleased
with it.

Mrs, Ryan and Mr. Blum reached
the peak of their performance with
the two movements from the
Brahms “Concerto in B Flat Ma-
jar," While it may have been too
heavy for complete appreciation
by the entire audience, it was evi-
dent such a tremendous work

have a comprehension of how such
a thing should be done Mrs. Ry-
an and Mr. Blum showed a defi-
nite, sensitive understanding of it.
its brilliancy was enhanced by the
expert manipulation of its diffi-
cult, intricate passages. Both art-
ists must be highly complimented
on the superior playing of it.

Mrs. Ryan always pleases her

audience by playing with a certain
