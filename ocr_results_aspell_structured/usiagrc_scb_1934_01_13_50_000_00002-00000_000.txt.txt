IN MEMORIAM
What became of tlle Pioneer Pl'illllllt‘si

Two years ago. the attempt to revive the all-
college revue died because of the inferior rtualitv
of the shits submitted for consideration A year
ago, the attempt at revival was begun too late for
serious consideration. This year, after much fuss
and ballyhoo. it would seem that there is all ill or
lute lack of interest. not only among students but
in the drailla department: and the chapter of Na
tioilal Collegiate Players as well.

Members of the last group—supposedly one of
the two sponsors of the revue-71love declared tliciue
selves entirely out of sympathy for the project.
Durinrv tlle months ill which members of Sigma
Delta 'hiitllc other sponsorehavc ‘tteinpted to
revive interest ill the allecollegc affair. the Nation-
al Collegiate Players o‘roup has not only been apae
tlietic but aiitagoni tlcialthough not to the c ,
tent of course, ol' rcnounciilg a share of the pr
fits if tllc revue were actually to be scheduled,

On the other hand. the Sigma Delta (“hi group
has becll c ti ed be al '9 it has never petitioned
the draluati council ill u r iug for permi 'ou in
present the Prndities, Yet, representatives of the
journal tic group have repeatedly been made to
understand that there \iollld be no chalice For pi'ese
emotion of the revue in a downtown theatre as had
been planned, even though the Sigma Delta Chi
chapter c pressed its willingness to underwrite all
expense

Those repr scntatives were also led to under
stand that students in the drama department were
not interested ill aiding with such a presentation
nor was the drama department anxious to have its
“equipment" used in such a project. For these, rea-
sons, the actual petition was never presented

With the exception of one hall—ill which there
n s a misllndc tanding—nlcli of the college bear-
tilv endorsed the project, The women, however, ai'e
tel tllrce ballots had beell taltcli, declared them-
selves against it by a close vote, due ill a large
measure to the undiploniatic request of the dra-
matic council that each building guarantee the exe
pensc of its act; ill the case that the Pruditics new
“not. a financial success.”

So it would seem that the Pioneer Prndities
are to be relegated to the ' apeheap on which lie
so many other Grilnlcll social traditions.

WHO’S GOING TO PAY?

Being a member of the generation which will
obviously be called upon to clear up the immense
debt. that. is being created by the present national
reconstruction and relief programs, the Alllcrican
college student of today is vitally, not to say
anxiously, concerned with how and when this ob-
ligation is going to be dispelled Included ill the
120 billion dollar budget requested by President
Roosevelt for the fiscal year of 193% is an ap-
propriation of nearly seven and a half billion dol-
lars to be distributed through the national rccoiie
stmotion and relief: agencies. of this amount.
nearly three billion dollars have been expended
already. it is the president’s belief that an ap-
propriation next year 0E two billion over the gov-
ernment running expenses should be sufficient to
complete the reconstruction activitic., so that a
return to a normal budget will be po. iblc ill
19 5. However, this will leave a debt of over
nine billion dollars to be paid ill the following
years. Tremendous as this sum is, the payment
of the debt will not be the burden which it, ap-
pears, if the task of reorganization is accomplish»
ed to the satisfaction of the, leaders of the recon-
struction campaign. r

’l‘wo primary tax sources, incomes and liquor,
will be depended upon to provide revenue for the
cancellation of the debt The amount which can
reasonably be expected from the latter source is
.still a matter of speculation. Consideration ol
tllc liquoretax problem has made it evident. that
the levy in th l field must be restricted to pr
vent the renewal of hootlegging activities. M01 -
over state, alld ill some instances, county and nine
niclpal goverulllents will also demand a share of

worm PATIENCE
(Oklahoma Daily)

One aspect of the recent wave of lynchings in wide-
ly separated parts of the country that has been over.
looked by commentators is the social unrest indicated.

For four years now the business and industry of
the nation has been shot to pieces . There are millions
of unemployed. Under such circumstances, there is
bound to be unrest. a feeling to strike out in blind rage
against. vague forces.

The patience of the American people in the depres-
sion has been commented on favorably by many writers.

I
L__

But after four years it is apparent that this patience ls ,

wearing thin.
In some parts of the country uni-est has been taken
out, in burning biidgcs and overturning milk trucks. In

Maryland, California. and Missouri, the people gave vent ,

to their unoctined emotions in lynching,
Unless economic conditions really improve, we may
look for more violent forms of such mob lawlessness.

Vivid personal recollections of the
speaker showed how the teacher on

"We neic attached to her by

Johan Sebastian Bach which revealed

fond. in addition there were two se-
lectiohs from “The Well Tempered
Clavicliord.”

The prelude was the old German
choral, harmonized by Bach, and call-
ed, “Nun Ruben Alle Waelder." The
first selection in the program proper
was two arrangements by Each of the
tamous old Epiphany hymn “Nun

Speaker Believes
New Third Party

“Lack of progressive action instate
political pal-tics lin spite of the lib-
eral attitude oi the national admixi-
istmtioui increases the need for a
new third party in Iowa,” said A -
chic Carter, 01' Oshnloosa, at a meet
ing‘ of the League [or Industrial Dome
ooi-aoy held in the Associations
building Wednesday night.

Mr. Carter, who is
new third party movement in iowa
stated that the farmers and laborers
of the state are protesting against
present injustices, and recent. confer»
ences indicate the possibility of a
strong baelring- for the movement.

“The type of party sought is still
in the lormulntlve process," said the
speaker, He believes that it may ole-
velop along the line of the Canadian
Earmer-Labor-Socinlist group.

In a discussion after the speech
there was considerable controversy
over the advisability of dividing the
liberal forces by organizing a new
party outside of the regular Socialist
ranks.
