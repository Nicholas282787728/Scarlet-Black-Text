Two Grinnell College students
were assaulted as they came back
from an early morning “doughnut
run" on October 29.

According to the two students,
seniors Phil Cebuhar and Jeff
Lindholm, they were crossing
Broad Street at 5th Avenue when
three men yelled out, “Hey, what
did you say?" AS the two Students
continued walking, the three men
ran up behind them and started
hitting them. Both Cebuhar and
Lindholm, surprised by the sudden
attack, protected themselves as
best as they could.

Shortly afterwards, a car with
three Grinnell College students
spotted the fight and recognized
Cebuhar and Lindholm. As the car
turned around and started down
the street, the attackers fled.

Cebuhar. the only casualty, was
taken to Grinnell General Hospital
with a cut above his left eyelid
requiring ten ’stitches, Both
students then went to the police
station and gave the license
