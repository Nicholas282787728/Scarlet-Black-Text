ii. The Right to Privacy
A, Each resident has the right oi privacy within his or her own room
i. Where the college or its representative seeks access to a student
room while school is in session, the resident shall be notitied oi such
planned entry no less than 24 hours in advance, and the resident shall
be permitted to be present. This right to 24»hour notice may be waived
by the resident, and a request for repairs automatically waives this
right,

PLEASE NOTE: The construction work on the ioggias requires access to

electrical outlets. it is imperative that this work be completed prior to
winter

THIS NOTE CONSTITUES ZAVHOUR NOTICE that your room may be
entered. '

The school appreciates your cooperation.

Those of you on campus should be familiar with the two excerpts above,
The first is from the Student Handbook, the second is a sign which has ap-
peared near the entryways oi the resident halls this past week. These signs
have been posted since one workers entered a student's room without giv»
ing 2~trhour noticed guaranteed in the Student Handbook. tThis story and a
letter irom the student involved were printed in last week's scum They ap-
pear to be an attempt to avoid iuture problems oi this sort at the expense of
student rights.

The tirst thing to be pointed out is that perpetual notice is equivalent to no
notice at all, It a student is informed one day that B510 workers will need to
enter his room the next day, he can make any arrangements which he may
have to, and his right or privacy within that room is not inlringed upon tat
least not within the conﬁnes of the agreement he makes with the college
when accepting the room However, it the student is told that someone may
enter his room the next day or any day thereaiter, the student's right to
privacy is being iniringed upon. Not knowing when the room will be entered,
the student no longer controls access to the room. Thus, the student no longer
retains his right oi privacy within that room,

However, 3&6 is still required to give the student at least some notice.
Reads the Handbook, "the resident shall be permitted to be present" when
the room is entered. Someone will have to arrange a time for entering the
room so that the student may be present it he wishes Hopelully, the student
will be contacted in some other fashion than the trial and error Opening of
doors used by 8&6 last week to find a room

Third, and probably most important. one should note that the "right to
24-hour notice may be waived by the resident." There is good cause to
believe that many students would waive that right it they were risked.
However, instead of finding these students whose rooms were located in
areas at which access might be needed and asking them ier permission to
enter the room on short or no notice, the college simply told these students
that they were on Continual 24-hour notice. and as a final insult, called it
cooperation.

It should be made clear that this editorial does not question that the work
on the logglas'should be done prior to winter. The question being raised is
whether or not the continual notice is necessary and proper. It the college
wished to keep irom trampling the students right oi privacy altogether.
some notice must still be given so that a student can be present when his
room is entered it he so desires. The amount of time saved over asking in-
dividual Students to waive their right to 24-hour notice is questionable. 0n
the other hand, it the college really wishes to save time. rooms could be
entered Without any specitic notice. This, however, would be a severe inlr-
ingement oi a student's right to privacy within his room The time gained
can hardly yustity such an iniringement oi student rights.

It is clear that two actions of the college should be condemned first, the
establishment of the continual notice removing the student's right of privacy
within his room; and second, the procedure oi telling the student that they
will have to torieit some of their rights instead of asking them to help in a
iriendly, cooperative manner A change oi policy in this area is delinitely
needed.
