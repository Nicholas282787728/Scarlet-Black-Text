Travers Suggests

Change In Method
To Election Board

Art Travers, Student Council
president, has made the fol—
lowing suggestions for changes
in student Council election pro-
cedures: ,

1. The, deadline for petitions
will be late in January or early
in February. There will be a
course on student government
for all candidates.

2. The date for the conven—
tion will be Feb. 16. The elec-
tion will take place a week
later than the convention, giv-
ing the candidates more time
to present their views.

None of these changes will go/

into immediate effect. The elece
tion board, consisting of Anne
Beuckman, League Board presi-
dent, John Egan, c of HP presie
dent, Travers and four other
persons, to be chosen by the
student Council Central com—
mittee, will make the final de—
cision on election changes.

The Central committee will
accept Election Board applicae
tions in about a week.

Anonymous Grant
To Aid Hungarians

an anonymous gift designated
to provide full expenses for two
Hungarian refugee students, one
of which must be a boy. The
scholarships are to cover the
expenses of a four-year course.
in addition, the Student Coun»
cil has voted to provide funds
for one additional boy.

The World University Service
is handling the problem of de»
termining which of the refugees
are capable of doing college
work. At the present time 260
Hungarian students, selected by
wus, are taking a nineeweek
Course in English at Hard col»
lege, Annandale-on-Hudson. New
York. it is from these 260 stue
dcnts that Grinnell may receive
the three who have been pro-
vided for.

Robert C. Sauers (admissions)
made it clear that we have not
yet received or accepted these
students. We arc competing with
many colleges and universities
throughout the country which
have offered similar oppo’rtuni—
ties.

It is hoped that the students
can be here for the beginning
of the next semester. 1f we
should not obtain or accept
three students now there is the
possibility of getting them from
the number of Hungarian refue
gees who may be admitted to
the United States later,
