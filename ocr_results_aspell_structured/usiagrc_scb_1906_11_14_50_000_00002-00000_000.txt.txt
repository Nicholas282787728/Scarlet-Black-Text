The fact that steps have been
taken to organize two more literary
societies in the college is signiﬁcant.
It shows that Iowa College is making
an advance in the matter of society
work. There is a feeling amougtllose
who are not members or societies that
new organizations are necessary and
they have expressed the intention or
taking the matter into their own
hands if the present organizations dill
not see iii: to promote the idea. This
means a. great. increase in society
spirit, a healthy thing for the college
and for the existing' societies. A new
society means more interest and spirit
in debating, oratory and kindred
things and deﬁnite plans am well be
made at once.

Since publishing the list or chupe
leaders for the Week it has occurred to
us that there is a deﬁciency in the
system as it is now carried out. The
custom seems to be to have the mem-
bers of the faculty lead in regular
order. though it is oi course necessary
to depart irom the plan at limes, ior
instance, when some outsider comes
in and is invited to lend‘ But there
is a greater omission than this in the
present system, Some or the strong-
est members of the faculty in their
lines of work are among the lady in-
struciols Their ability and popular-
ity would insure their balm: success

We do not know but it calls for notice,
it is a matter for every person in
college to consider careiully, The
success or she plan rests upon the
loyalty or the iour classes to the idea;
each as it becomes the senior class
must adopt the accepted design in
order to make it permanent. It
would therefore seem that to insure
the working out of the plan euoh elm
must bind itself to support the now

was intended. A deiinite pledge
should be secured from each class ba-
lore the new design is accepted.
