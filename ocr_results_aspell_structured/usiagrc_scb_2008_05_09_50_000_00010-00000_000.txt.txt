Cleveland Lounge: smoke-free, not communi

BYCHLOEMORYL

The smoke Free Air Act may he extin-
guishing Cleveland Lounges cigarettes (see
story on page 1), but the lounge's community
will likely continue to burn bright.

After Younker Pit lounge was eonverted
into the Stonewall Resource Center in the
summer or" 2007, Cleveland First lounge be-
came the only lounge on campus to provide
shelter to this campus's many smokers.

But as orluly 1, the law Will effectively ban
smoking in both puhlie and private buildings,
including Grinnell’s cherished haven of smoke.
But students question security‘s success in en-
forcement, and maintain the belief that using
Cleveland as a smoking lounge may be the
hardest habit to break.

"I don't think it‘s actually going to work for
the first few months,” said Cleveland resident
and lounge frequenter Ashley Bennett ’11,
“People are still going to smoke here."

Aja Saunders v09, who lives in Dibble but
frequents the lounge, agreed. “I

only so much you can take until you ﬁnd some

where else to go smoke," said Saunders. “I just

feel like not hanng a smoking lounge is going

to make people smoke more in their rooms or
in the loggia,"

Even without the
smoking lounge, resi-
dents said Cleveland will
still maintain at least a
spark of its old culture.

lounge."

Though smoke may be absent, many oethe
same races will appear in Cleveland lounge next
year. “So many of the kids that live here now are
living here next year," said Mac Pohanka ’03.
"Not a lot orpeople knew [the law] was going
to affect Cleveland."

But a smoke-friendly environment wasn't
the only advantage drawing students to the
residence hall. “Cleveland is an exception for a
lot of reasons," said Pohanka, “it's not just in,
cause it has a smoking lounge." It seems the old
adage applies: you can take the smokers out of
Cleveland,but you can't take the Cleveland out
of the smokers
