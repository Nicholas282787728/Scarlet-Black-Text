Scarlet 8’ Black 0 Friday,“ September 17

As the 2000 Presidential election ap-
proaches, the Campus Democrats are going
into high gear.

In the ﬁrst two weeks ofschool, the group
has signed up 140 new voters and brought
Presidential candidate Bill Bradley to cen»
tral campus. But, general coordinator Greg
Schrieber ’02 said, that’s just the beginning.

This year, Schrieber said, the Democrats
are divided into four subgroups. Phoebe Silag
’00 is leading theAl Gore campaign on cam»
pus, while Ashley lones ’02 is heading up
the Bradley campaign. Shannon Anderson
’01 is coordinating the group’s involvement
with the Iowa Democratic party, and Mar
garet orwig ’01 is keeping Campus Demo—
crats in touch with the Poweshiek County
organization,

Gtinnell students have a unique oppote
tunity to get involved in the race for Presi—
dent because of Iowa’s ﬁrst»in»the»nation
Caucus, said Schrieber. “Caucus night is
probably the biggest night in the Presiden-

tial election cycle.” he said.

In addition, high voter participation is
essential in order to keep the Iowa Caucus
first on the calendar, Anderson said, “If the
turnout’s not there in January, Iowa might
not be the number-one Caucus,” she said.

To drum up student participation, “dorm
captains" will be canvassing their halls to sign

up people to vote and remind them about
the caucuses. “There will be somebody re-
sponsible for making sure that the people on
any given ﬂoor are all registered to vote,"
Schrieber said. This is the ﬁrst year the
Democrats have had dorm captains.

According to Anderson, 98 percent of
Grinnellians who were registered voters par-
ticipated in the last contested caucuses.

Currently, Scliriebet estimated, about 400
Grinnell students are registered to vote in
Poweshiek County. Most of those are Demov
crars.

Six Gtinnell students attended a caucus
training session in Ames last Saturday, fol»
lowed by a fundraiser for Jane Gteimann, a
candidate for the Iowa legislature from Story

County.

Anderson said that some Gtinnell stu-
dents might go to Ames on a regular basis to
help with Greimann’s campaign. Greimann
is running in a special election for an open
seat, which was previously held by a Rep ub-
lican legislator.

Seven Grinnellians were also among the
500 people at the annual Harkin Steak Fry
last Sunday, Anderson said. The event, which
was a fundraiser for U.S, Senator Tom
Harkin, drew such figures as Al Gore, Lieu<
tenant Governor Sally Pederson, and U.S.
Congressman Leonard Boswell, who repre-
sents Grinnell‘s district.

Future plans include a trip to the annual

Grinnellian of the week:

said.

The Al Gore subgroup is working on
bringing theVice President to Campus for a
rally similar to last week’s.

Anderson said that Senator Harkin has
already agreed to come and speak at Grin-
nellr

One of the Democrats main goals,

Anderson said, is to help link together
Democratic organizations all over Iowa. “I've
seen a real lack ofcoherence along the state’s
YD [Young Democrat] groups,” she said. “I’d
like to see Gtinnell as a leader."

Gtinnell Democrats are currently worlta
ing with a new chapter at Central College in
Pella, Anderson reported, The idea is to
“show politicians that young people care, and
get our voice heard, and our issues listened
to," she said.

American studies professor LeAnnc
Howe has been writing for the better
‘ portion other life. No matter her pm»
rcssion, whether it be journalism, bond
trading, or teaChing, she's been writing.
Ultimately, it was what brought her to
Gtinnell. Said Howe, “I’m a writer.
That’s why Gtinnell hired me."

A Choctaw Indian, Howe was born
in Edmond, Oklahoma From thevery
beginning, she's been surrounded by
stories. Howe was born in a home for
single mothers which was located above
a movie theater. Howe said with a smile,
“Sometimes I wonder what movie was
playing when I was born, what story
was being told.”

After college, shc moved to Texas,
where she started and ran her own pr—

' per at age 25. She rhcn became a jour»
nallst for the Dallas Morning News.
she interviewed Presidents Reagan and
Carter, among other polincal figures,
in her time there.

All the while, she continued towrite
plays and short ﬁction in her spare time.
Her ﬁrst published work, a collection
orshorr stories entitled Cay”: Paprrr,
was published in 1985.

After 10 years in journalism, Howe
switched ﬁelds and became a Wall
Street bond trader for Paine Webbct.
She believes her journalism background
prepared hcr ror her new job. Afterall,
she said. “News drives the market.”

As usual, How: was writing during
this time aswcll. Hctstory “An Ameri-
can in New York," an account of the

wall street bonds trading, was pub-
lished in 1987.

After four years in the Big Apple,
Howe once again switched gears and
became a teacher. Teachingjobs at the
University of Iowa and Carleton Coir
lege eventually led her to Gtinnell Col-
lege, She is the school’s rrrsr full-time
member of the American studies den
partmenr. She is also the first Ameri-
tan Indian to teach full-time at the col-
lege,

Howe said she was drawn to Grin-
ncll by the students. I like Gtinnell stu-
dents. They have a good sense ofinvesa
tigation.” However, she adds, she be-
lieves they are not as liberal as they may
think. “Students here are pretty conser-
wtive. They’ll probably kill me for say.
ing that,"

Howe’s literary background informs
and inﬂuences her teaching. “I see ev-
erything I do as a way to write—even
teaching." Inﬂuenced by her back

ground in playwrighting, she sees teach-

 

ing as a type ofpcrfotmance, where she
seeks to both inform and interest the
audience, her students. She adds, “All
my classes end [the scmcsrer] in some
kind orperrormance.”

Of course, when she is not teach-
ing, l-lowc is busy writing. This fall, she
has 7 writing projects, ranging from fic-
(ion to plays to an autobiographical es.

up for publication in the near future.
