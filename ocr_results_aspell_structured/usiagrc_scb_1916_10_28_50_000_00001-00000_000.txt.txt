Adluillistrhiioll llopes To Increase the
Comforts of College Men—Is No
Money Making Proposition,
Announces College.

The plan of eventually housing the
men oi the college in dormitories is
one which has been under considera-
tion by the administration of Grinnell
for some time. In fact the idea orig-
inated fully as soon as that of the res
cently completed Womens Quadrangle
and was only kept in the background
pending the completion of the latter
structure.

As can readily be seen from the
statements given out by the admini-
stration in connection with the letting
of the contract for the new buildings,
the development of the hlcns Quad-
rangle to completion will be a matter

of only a few years. They will not allI

he built at once as were the units or
the Womens Quadrangle.
llhy Build More Xext Ye

In his annual report last year PrCsA
ident Main laid particular emphasis
upon this feature of the building of
men’s dormitories fer Crinnell. It was
his idea then and the idea that has
been adopted by the administration
that the dormitories should be built
gradually. The building of the houses
01 the Quadrangle irill not be hi iied.
biit will rollow the influence and pork
ularity of the dormitory idea. If there
is a demand next year for three dddir
tioual cottages then that many may be
built, The construction all along is
to folloiv rather than precede any
needs.

Hope To Illcrmlse Colllfuris.

The college will attempt at all points
in the development of the Quadrangle
to cooperate with the men at the in-
stitution. The whole idea is to in—
crease the comforts and advantages of
the college men and to gire them {do
cilities commensurate with the stand-
ards of Grinnell.

The quadrangle idea to the admini-
stration is no money making pmposl»
tion. The three houses now to he coli-
striicted are ﬁnanced by a bond issue.
It is planned that the revenue from
the dormitories will pay the interest
upon this borrowed money. Evenillul»
ly, however, the propo. tion will be
tinaneed by applying gifts to the col—
lege toward taking up the bonds .sued
for the dormitories.

L'nit Plan Is Unique.

The unit plan to he used in the
liuildiiig of the new quadrangle is
unique. It is also of great significance
in that it is a comparatively new idea
and will be watched with interest all
over the country.

The college believes that this plan
will be successtul, The theory is that
the small houses, prov ing for an av-
erage of thirty men in each, will give

' all the advantages that a small group
of men can iind in living together.
And the tact that the men are broken
up into small groups each in a mean-
m-e clfegoverning, ought iii no way
do. troy the feeling that they are in
every sense a whole, since the quad-
rangle must tend to centralize the iii-
terosts of the small group by the ICC!»
ing that all are an equal part at and
have an equal share in the democracy
of the college.

Makes First Touchdown for The Third Time This Year.

 

CEDAR RAPIDS, Ia, Oct. 28 (Spa-
cial to The Scarlet and Black.)71n
what probably was one of the hardest
{ought contests ever staged on an Iowa
field, Grinuell College defeated Coe
this afternoon by a score of 10 to o.
The points were made as the result of
a touchdown by Rallely and it wanders
rul drop-kick by Augustine from the
forty yard line that went square be-

tween the goal posts.

During the Iii-st half the maroon
and old gold held Gl'imlcll's ofleiisivc
plays with a despeiation seldom seen.
The battle was hard fought in this pe-
riod, as it was our g the whole game.
In the third quarter, however, Grin—
nell hmkc loose and aitcr pushing the
Coe eleven down the field by line
smashes and forward passes, succeed-
‘ed in sending Raftety over for a Lunch-
dowii. Augustine, uiiahle to gain on
elldrl‘ulls, brilliantly redeemed hiniselt
in the last period by his great Iorty
yard drop kick.

The largest crowd in the histon ot
Coo gathered on the field to witness
the contest. IL' was reported that
there were fully three thousand peo—
ple in the stands when the game coni-
menced. However. the rain during the
first half of the game placed the field
in miserable shape for loud end riius.
Throughout the game the crowd yelled
as though they were wild. After Raf~
fcty made the touchdown they urged
their team on to victory, lnit the strain
of the leiocious fight began to tell on

The accident happened about eight
o'clock last night.
opinion seems to be that Soiners had
too heavy a charge of powder in his
tray. After trying twice to set ol‘[ the
flash, he stopped up to investigate its
failure to go off. The powder flashed
in his face, burning him severely about
the race and hands.

He was taken home immediately and
at first it was feared that his eyes
would be affected or that he would
lose his eyesight entirely. a thorough
examination by Dr. P. E. Somers this

rest. The doctor cleaned thc powder
out of his cyes and the victim was able
to see with both. The opinion was

The scarlet and black backfield was
greatly hampered by the loss of both
Barrett and Watt. Schulz played a
wondertul game at half. llis defen-
sivc work was considered as one of
the best ever seen on the fiald. On
the otteuse he returned punts like a
veteran. Elfl'illk for Coe was the only
man they could depend upon to make
gains. Ile returned punts in beautiful
style, and printed out of danger on the
many times it was necessary. Peter-
son. playing center for Coc, put up the
host defensive game for his team. 0:-
good and Ginglcs outplayed their team
mates both on the offense and defense.
The rest of the line on both teams was
about equally matched, and fought
each other hard.

First QllltrIeT.

Many penalties in the first quarter
caused serious losses to both teams.
Both the teams battled each other to
a standstill. Captain Barrett in mak-
ing a tackle broke his finger, and
Grant went in his place. Elli-ink
played a. great game for Coe in this
iperiod, making most of God's gains.

Augustine pulled off a thirty yard
run around lclt cud, when the ball was
in Grinncll's territory. Alter that, the
.play was in 009‘s region, Grinncll
isending the ball as far as Coe's fif—
teen yard line. Barrett did most of
the line plunging for the scarlet and
‘black, until he broke his finger. After
scesawing back and forth in her own
territo y Coe was held for downs on
,its own twenty yard line. Elf nh

The crowd arose and gave great cheers

territory most 01' the half. The deten-

a punting contest. Crinnell gained a
few more yards than Coe in this half.
The field at the end or the half was

nell came back strong in the third pe-

forward passes were completed by
cither team. On account of the wet
ball, both teams fumbled many times.
Those by Coe were extremely costly,
the last one being picked up by Mfr
icty, who ran with it for a touhcdown.
The teams saw that they could not
gain around the ends, so they resorted
to line plunging. Coe succeeded in
gaining a few more yards on lino
smashes than Grinnell did, but Augus-
tine outpunted Elfrink, which evened

18:35 2 is a new record.

All four Classes were T’eD)‘ ﬁelded

That it is the duty or every young
man to definitely associate himself
with a political party early in life,
was the statement of W. L. Harding,
Republican candidate for governor oi!
Iowa, in a very interesting ad -ess at
Y. M. C. A. last Thursday evening. A
rowd that filled the Association rooms
to overllnwiug, heard the speech. MT.
Harding was accompanied by it H.
M. Ilavner, candidate for attorney geu<
eral on the same ticket, who was the
second speaker of the evening. Both‘
held the attention of their audience at
all times.

“The young man need not agree
with every policy which his party on:
dorscs," nlr. Harding said. “Never-
theless, it is unwise to dl'III: from party
to party simply because of a few initial“
differences of opinion, I hope that‘
the time will come when governmental
affairs and political life will receive
more attention in our colleges than
today, so that young men may act
more intelligently in regard to poli-
tics.”

“Know How To Meet Men.”

He repeatedly cmpha and the fact
that the greatest thing in the world is
to know how to mcet men. "Your su -
ccs-” he declared, “bill be measured
by your ability to size up a man and
then to deal with him accordingly,
When I graduated from college, I
found that the most useful part of my
education was the fact that I had tak-
en the first step in getting acquainted
with men. I have found this to be of
inestimable value throughout my pub—
lic cfu'eel'.” .

“A great fundamental in success,"
lar. liar-ding said, “IS the ability to
ask the question ‘lllly?’ Many a young
man, as he goes through college, does
not put the question mark often
enough. The young man or women
n ho does not form that habit during
his college days undoubtedly never
will.

”The groatcst study in lite is man,"
concluded the speaker. "The only way
to success ‘- to learn to meet him and .
to deal with him, Wheli you hate done
that, you have mastered yourself."
