To the Editor.

In last week's adds, 1 noted an article
about Norris Hall and the lack of respect
for it. I believe that justice was served
even ii all the residents suffered for the ac-
tions of a tew. That is usually what hapr
pens e "one bad apple spoils the whole
bunch.

The Grinnell experience is, I agree, sup-
posed to be a good one However, it also
should be an educational one.

It the Norris Hall residents. and
specifically the two who wrote the article,
wish to have more respect lor their Hall,
they Should ALL do something to make it
more respectable and enjoyable. With a
little creativity, 1 am sure that they can
come up with something. Have a money
raising effort. Then use the money to help
improve Norris Hall. The economy, as i
am sure you all know, isn't die best. i am

'sure the trustees and administrative staff

of the college would appreciate any efforts
students might put iorth to improve any
hall on campus. But I suppose that that
idea never crossed your mind.

So stop complaining abut what is
“wrong" and start doing something to
make it “right.” I know it is only a tem-
porary home but you should be able to sur-
vive until you graduate or transfer to
another college. Until that time, don't
compare your dormitory, hall or room to a
rundown “Holiday Inn" and do something
to turn it into the best Holiday in“ in the
World. I am sure, then and only then, will
redundant statements and vandalism stop
and the proper respect be given to all dor-
mitories, halls and rooms on the campus,
thereby making the Grinnell experience
the good experience it was meant to be.
Sincerely. Betty Anderson, Layout, Grill-

Editor’s Note:

The 5&3 also wanG to clarify Jeff Ray»
mond's role in regards to the article.
Although he is a Norris fourth resident, his
opinion is not axial-med in the piece.
Rather, he only worked with the author in
organizing her ideas clearly.
