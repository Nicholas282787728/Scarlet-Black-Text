Allrl it came to miss tl

God,nndhe read to the assembled
multitude, both men and
maidens, o. pillaLle about Ditrid the
King, who, having iought rcliuntly
ugaiusthis enemies, began to thirst,
and then silitl to himself, "0h! If I
had a drill]: [rain the well \l hieh ill

their llcllnehs they brought the water
ior the King, whom they loved.
\Vllell David 5th how the hail

foolish \rlsl he said, “For be it from
me to drink the blood of these men,”
and he poured the waiter upon the
ground, as a sacrilice unto the Lord.

And those who heard the scribe
read and interpret this parable said,
“Why prateth he such stuff.” And
others said, “King Ditrid was '4 fool,
though the scroll says he was a man
alter God’s onnheart. Why did he
not drink the water alter it was
broughthim?" And otherssaid, “It
was good icr the men to sacriﬁce
themselves and others for the sake of
a foolish wish-it develops the virtue
refilled chivalry,”

The lirst intercollegiate ball game
(the old gnme of round hnse hall) was
played at Pitbslield, Mass, between
teams rcprcscnting Amherst and Wit
hams, on July 1, 1859. The men who
were to ccmpcsc the team irom Am-
her-st were chosen by ballot irom the
student body. The only attempt at
uniiorm was a blue ribbon which ouch

This is not iudiridual mutter,
but is or concern to the entire college
community. The action oi airy group
oi individuals strikes at the core oithe
institutional lire. Consequently those
who duncc put themselves out oi har-
molly with the institution. By that
act they decide ior themselves wheth—
er or not Grinnell can serve their best
interests.

We want the best college here. We
nrustlire our own liie and work out
our own problems. Whenever Grin-
ucll decides that dancing will add to
studentlife we will have it. When-

pile up the score, when baskets by
Slulz, K. Carney and Klein soon ran
the score up to seventeen. The halt
ended: Grinnell, 17; Missouri, 3.

Grinnell came back strong in the
