Dihhle prep, had occasion to call Kay
Cox on the night of the hall. After
discoursing at this and that, Kay
asked Boardman if he would like to
come over to the colonial hall and
have a dance with her. Boardmau
said he would sure enjoy it hut he
was afraid that he’d have to decline
this time. It seems he didn't have
the slightest idea where he could
procure a pair of George Washington
pants at such a late hour.

Last week some of the girls went
over to Gihnan to put on a. little
dance act. Among the said girls
was Betty chaivonnes The dance
ﬂoor was slick and it is no reflec-
tion on Betty's ability as a dancer
that she fell, or sat down rather
hard on two or three occasions in
the course of the program. The
funny part car-he following the pro-
gram when one of the local ma-
trons rushed up and engaged Miss
Chavannes in a, conversation.

Matron: My dear, isn’t it fortu—
nate that you were well padded
with pillows when you slipped dur-

B. Chnvonneei Lady, those aren‘t
pillows; that‘s ME. '

The council of House Presidents
has decided to sell the ping-pong to~
hie under Gates, which news will
undoubtedly come as a great blow to
Mr. Irwin and Miss Mussey, who
were wont to while away many a
weary hour during open houses play-
ing‘ping—pong or something, as Mr.
Eliot Darke can testify. It now
comes out that Mussey’s date with
Knowlton was merely a lure for the
calm Irwin who, it seems, wasn't dis-
playing the proper amount of order.
