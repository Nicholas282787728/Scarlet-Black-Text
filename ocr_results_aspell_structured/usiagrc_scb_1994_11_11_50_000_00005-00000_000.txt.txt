A weekly survey of the best and worst in Quad cuisine

By JED ORTH,JASONWOLF,
JON ROSE & MATT HABER

TONIGHT’S dinner is an old
family favorite. What farrb
ily? Wedon'tknow. Origi-
nally concocted in the fabled village
bearing itsnnme, Brunswick chicken
and noodles was developed at the
College of Brunswick by four aspirr
ing food critics. Theiruniquechickcn
stew won the heartof many a young
lass. one of whom was Sheila, who
broughtitwithhertoGrinnell. Fellas,
thisisa good one foraﬁrstdate. Just
don‘t drink too much afterwards.
Complementing this meal are the
Cuban Beans. ¥¥¥

Saturday lunch is one ofthe four
times you will ever see us rate a meal
with five stars. Guacamole layer
salad, known as 01.5 to the pros, is a
favorite. Vegans, try to pick out the
sour cream and cheese, and well.
never mind, you‘re stuck with the
Spanish rice. (divans) For dinner,
wecan'tﬁgureouthowtobabybrown
something, but the potatoes are good
anyway. It‘s hard to mess up spa—
ghetti, but they manage by putting
hailstone—size sausages in the sauce.
Jon drools over the four-layer des-
sert. (¥¥¥)

Sunday lunch is good. Cheese

souffle and the fresh baked bagels
soak up any hangover. Blueberry
pancakes nudge this up to ***. The
French bread pizza fordinneris good
ifcn'sp enough. Jon and Jed like to
load it with red pepper. The vegan
pizza gives you gas, and is a strange
color, but we hear itmakes you halluA
cinzlte. Cool, daddy»o. (¥¥ 1/2)
Monday lunch is one of the best
of the rotation. Chicken fillet sand-

Matt to emulate his hero, Homer
Simpson. The batter fried shrimp
carries the slogan: “It’s not all you

party in my mouth and everyone’s
invitedr" Add to this devil's food
cake and you got yourself one hell of
a meal. (¥¥¥¥)

Tuesday lunch: shoestring fries.
Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome In

anything less, Shoestring fries are a
meal in and of themselves, We rcc~

is roast turkey. Didn’t we just have
that?! The vegan option is Moroccan
couscous. Although wccouldn’tfind
it on our trip to Africa, we hear the
vegans like this shit. (¥¥, ¥¥¥¥ for
vegans)

Jon, Jason and Matt are honor-
