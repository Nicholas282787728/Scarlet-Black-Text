Town Students’
Charges Raised
for 1935-36

Town students will pay a bimr
ket fee for college expenses next
year. which will increase their
charges by approximately $20, Mr.
L. v. Phelps, college treasurer,
said yesterday.

The new rates are $300 for a lib-
eral arts student and $330 for mu—
sic students as compared with ap-
proximate charges of $230 and
3310 of previous years.

In an explan tion of the general
increase in tuition charges, Mr.
Phelps stated that it is the belief
of the trustees and the adminis—
tration that the increase in re-
ceipts from tuition and special
gifts will perhaps enable the 001*
lege to restore to all staff mem—
bers at least a portion of the sal-
ary cuts which have been made
necessary by reduced revenues
since 1930.

Whether or not these increases
will be sufficient to bring this
about is still an open question but
this is the primary object in add-
ing to tuition charges at this time.

The action was voted by the
