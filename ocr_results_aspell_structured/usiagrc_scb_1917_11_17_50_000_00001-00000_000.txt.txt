NDV. 24, IS DAY DF REBKDNING

Grinnell Is
Slate

Superior to Iowa
on ‘ Comparative
Score Basis

With only one game left for Clark
neil on the 1917 schedule, a study or
the exact status of the scarlet team
among the others of the state might
.not be amiss at this time.

A's conditions now stand, there are
but two teams who have a rightful
claim to the title, “Champions of
iowa." Those teams are Allies and
Grinnell. Both have gone thru the
season without suffering a defeatfrom
an Iowa school, altho Amcs did lose
a close contest to Kansas. They re-
trieved their defeat last Saturday by
trimming the Kansas Aggics, who had
beaten Kansas two weeks before,
thus I'e»establishlng their claims as
one of the premier teams of the Mis—
souri Valley conference.

Scored 0n But‘ Twice

Grinnell has not lost a game this
season, and has been scored on but
twice, \one of the tallies heing regis-
tered by an out-of—the»slme team.
.Her biggest victory was that over
vaa, Orville 20th of October, and on
this victory will one place her most
signiﬁcant claim to the title, The
local team has scored a total of 234
points to her opponents' 14 so far
this season, her supeiority being
clearly demonstrated in every cen-
test.

Saturdayt November 24th, will he
the day of reckoning for four teams
in the state. On that day Iowa and
Ames meet at Iowa City in their an—

‘ Dual game, and Griunell will go
against Cornell at Mount Vernon. On
the first contest depends Gl'lnncll’s
hopes for the state championship. If
she defeats Cornell, as the dope indi-
cates she should, and Iowa beats
Andes, her claim to the title will be
clear. In case Ame: is victorious, a
‘tle will result between the Aggies
and Grinnell, with no way of settling
it except by comparative scores.

(‘oiiipurlllivc Scores

Judged on that basis, Grim-tell has
the edge so far. The only team which
both Ame: and Grinnell have played
is Care. Aides conquered the Ehyitcs
by a 7—0 score, whilc Grinneil ran
over them for a 4570 victoiy. In case
Allies defeats lows, the score of that
game will furnish more material for
comparison. The limes-Drake contest.

~ h Ames almost a sure winner,
gives another chance to settle the
championship on paper.

Parsons is the only other undefeat-
ed team in the state. That school is

’represcnted this year by the best
team in its history, a team which de—
feated Cornell 11-7, and which has
not lost ‘a game in the Iowa confer»
ence, Comparative scores will again
be the method of settling any argu-
ment with Grinnell, and again the
scarlet has the edge at the present
time. vrarsons routed Highland Park
by a 66-0 score. but thnnell walked
away from the Des Moincs institution
on a 7770 count. The Grinneli—Corncll
scrap will he ﬁnal judgment on the
matter.

A plea for the add on support of
the fund was the basis ol the Friday
chapel talks given by Professors Stei—
ner and Noble.

“What are you sacriﬁcing?" Dr.
Steiner asked. "1 don't want a single
man or woman in the college to say
that he has not given anything. ’If
he can't. earn it or borrow it, let him
come to me!"

Professor ,Nohle challenged the stir
dents to reach and surpass the stand—
ard of $5,000 set by Cornell.

“The average pledge should hc 310,"
the professor continued. “We should
match the semester fee.”

Lloyd w. Taylor, ’10, instructor-in
mathematics and physics here last
year, has received his commission in
the regular army as second lieuten—
ant of the coast artillci . The
commission comes as a result of his
passing the competitive examination,
which, with 400 others, he took last
summer at Fort Leavenworth. It is
entirely independent/of his more re—
cent connection with thc cificers' re-
serve camp.

On August 27 he went to Fort
Snolling to enter the second ott'ic rs'
reserve camp, but about a month later
was transferred to Fortress Monroe,
Virginia, where he remains , engaged
in the study of coast ar llery, until
he received his commission.

Tnylor writes that there is only one
thing about the present situation that
he regrets, and that is that he fears
he will not be able to secure a fur-
lough home, as he would surely have
had if he had received his commission

at the close of the training in the of»
