0 Interest Dead?

President Stevens, ill a recent letter to the
Scarlet and Black, cited the poor attendance
at the Student Council inauguration, as an
example of lack of interest in student gov-
ernment.

We believe, however, that the President
is exaggerating a minor point.

The inauguration was only the aftermath
of what counted, the electio . No one could
accuse the students of passivity at election.

More recently, student government drew
full support from the quad and dorms dur-
ing the Dibble affair.

We could cite nlany lnore examples of
student government working, and working
effectively backed wholeheartedly by the
students ‘

If there is a lessening of interest at all
in our government, it may be blaliied to the
larger world nffail'sithe war and the draft
—for these do and should command our
attention before all else.

And then, too; spring mornings are too
enticing to promote a fail'esized chapel at—
tendance, no matter what the program may
be.

To the editor:

The news that there is to bc no
Commencement play comes as a
surprise. Who dictated that pol-
icy? It certainly could not be
the deporiment of drums, for
Commencement is one of the big-
gest dates on its calendar. It
can't be the students or alumni—
Commencement plays are always
well attended. And they should be.
They are polished productions.

The proposed holc in the Com-
menoement program has created
a small furor in several alumni
groups. Can’t something be done
about it?
