END OF AN EPOCHu

With tonight’s ,game Grinnell opens its
last football season until the end of the
war. Next year intercollegiate football will
be banned by the administration, and ac-
cording to the authorities, army and navy
schools will have the only teams in competi-
tion and even their play may be restricted.

The logic of this ruling is immediately
obvious to any sensible person. It is not
a question of morale, nor maintaining phy-
sical education departments. It is a ques-
tion of rubber and gasoline and busses and
trains overcrowded with war travel.

It is a question of players, as already
evidenced by the dropping of the freshmen
rule in many colleges to get the man power
necessary for a football team.

So this is an obituary; an obituary for an
epoch not yet quite dead. It was a mus-
cular epoch of great heroes, big money,
huge crowds and subsidized players.

THE MAN WE CHOOSE--

At this stage of the academic year, while
we are still primarily engaged in such pur-
suits as meeting the new students and mem-
orizing our class schedules, it is a hit diffi-
cult to realize that the time has come when
we must once again elect a new student
council president

Never before has a Grinnell student body
been faced with such important political
business immediately upon its own return
to school.

Our student lender must be a man who
has the judgment and ability necessary to
help solve the important problems peculiar
to a college society newly invaded by an
army of 750 uniformed men.

It is important too, that the man we
choose be one who will, in all probability,
be on campus long enough to get more than
just a start in matters of student govern-
men.

A great deal of responsibility awaits the
man who will fill the position. Right now,
it is our responsibility to choose him wisely.

LITITLE SEEN, DOES MUCH--

Almost every institution has at least one
unsung hero. This person usually does a
lot of good things for a great many people,
but the majority of them never know of
his existence. Gl‘innell has an unsung
hero in the form of Mrs. Ray Ferguson—or
just Ferg to her friends. Ferg is the head
of the housekeeping department of the col-
lege. It is she who has to supervise the
exodus of the college boys and all their
belongings from the dorms, and the ingress
of the army. These two items alone would
give one person a full time job~not Ferg.
She works like a Trojan at least ten hours
a day moving all over the campus, chasing
down workers, materials, and the army.

When you get a new rug in your room,
or the leaky faucet has been fixed, you
take it for granted and think nothing about
it. However, there has been as much Ferg
in that deal as there would‘ be if the almy
took over the quad. Everyone “gripes" to
Ferg at once on what they want done to
the house, their office, their dorms, or their
lawn. She has to listen to the lament of
the lazy professor who wants Ferg‘s depart-
ment to bring over some cases to his office
and pack up his books for him; to the wail
of the student who wants to know when he
will receive a tie rack for his room—when
some students do not even have their house
ready yet; plus all the gimme gimmie‘s she
has to listen to all day every day.

If ever a woman should receive credit
where credit is due, it is this little five foot,
two inch lady who gets things done quickly
and correctly. If you have not made her
acquaintance, it is well worth your while

Another stipulation is the
promise to increase the amount
of each scholarship in propor—
tion to any change in tuitition or
fees which may Occur in the
future.

Conditions on which the awards
are renewed remain the same:
the mamtcnance or a satisfactory
grade point average, and the good
conduct of the student.

The physics department is trying
to be brave these days. Less than
a week ago it had a 56—hour
hand»mude English chronometer.
lNow Grant 0. G'als, associate
professor, can only point Silently
to the Spot where the chrono-
meter has stood since 1888, when
Grinnell Was the naval observa-
tory time station for thls area,

Somewhere on the Atlantic or
Pacific a naval Vessel will soon
be using it for a far more im-
portant purpose than classroom
instruction. Gale said.

The United States Navy is in
need of an the chronometers it
can buy, but has only been able
to get approximately forty a
month from various colleges, uni‘
versities, and jewelers m the
states,

The chronometer was turned
over to an authorized agent of
the Navy at the bcalnhlng of the
week, and will be sent to an
“unknown destination."
