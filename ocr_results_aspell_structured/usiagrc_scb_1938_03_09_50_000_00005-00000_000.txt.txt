Ignorance Seen
As Base of Many
English Beliefs

With the statement, “The Eng-
lish, are they human?” Dr. Wale
tei- M. Kotschnig began his lec-
ture last evening in Herrick
chapel on the suhject of “Eng-
land: A study in Provincial-
ism.” According to Kotschnig,
the more you know the Engllshr
man the less you understand
him.

The Englishman, according to
the speaker, hases his heliefs on
ignorance, which makes him more
dogmatic, and has made it pos-
sible to build up the empire with-
out troubling his conscience.

The Englishman distrusts ah—
stract reason, to which he pie
fers instinct and intuition. While
the Frenchman analyzes, the
Englishman grasps large pl‘incie
ples.

He is extremely antagonistic to
anything systematic and definite.
This evidences itself in his tene
dency to understatement, and in
his reluctance to comit himself.

The Englishman is full of selfe
assurance and self centeredness.
The English and everything can—
ncctcd with them are, according
to the English, the best there is.

Because he hates system,
Englishman is naturally very
ndaptahle to different situations,
when it is necessary. He is al-
ways willing to compromise, when
the situation demands. Although
you might deduce from the fore-
going that England is a country
of confusion and turmoil, the
speaker went on to say that three
things helped to prevent this con-
dition.

These three are religion, cons
volition, and the Celtic fringe, all
of which have their ineVItable iii-
flucncc on English life.
