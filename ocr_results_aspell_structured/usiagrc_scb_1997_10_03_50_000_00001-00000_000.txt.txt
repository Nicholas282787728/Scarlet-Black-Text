Scientists Link Weight to Genetics

Scientists say they‘ve identified another gene involved

the color ofti mouse's fill', which is how the researchers
tracked it down. Mice with ti certain mutation linked to

Board of Trustees committs to space

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Last weekend marked the first meet-
ing ofGrinnell’s Board ofTrustee’s Sub-
committee on Space for the first time
since Its inception in April 1997. The
subcommittee was formed in response to
a formal proposal sent by the Grinnell
Space Committee, a group ofstudents and
staff interested in looking into the possi-
bilities of building a campus center to
house offices and meeting rooms for Stu»
dent organizations. This meeting was seen
by many to be recognition ofa project that
has been years in the making.

“It was only the most the most recent
step in a process that has been going on
for years," conﬁrmed SGA President Erin
Childrcss ‘98.

After a few previous attempts and years
of discussion, members of Grinnell’s
Space Committee sent an ofﬁcial proposal
to the Trustees last April, mapping out
what the needs were on campus. The pro-
posal included the needs of religious, so-
cial andethnic organizations, as well as a
request for space for Griniiell‘s post of-

fice and Community Service Center,
which are both looking to expand. These
needs have been most visibly discussed
by multicultural groups but have also been
expressed by scores ofGnnnell’s over 110
organizations which don‘t have a private
location to meet,

“The meeting went really well," said
Childress of the first meeting. “but there
are lots of logistics to work out before
anything gets built."

Childress, who served on the SGA
cabinet last year as the All Campus Events
Coordinator, inherited this epic of an is-
sue from her predecessor, SGA President
and member of the 19951997 Space
Committee Rupin Thakkar ‘97. Thakkar,
a strong supporter of the space initiate,
not only gave a multimedia presentation
to the Board of Trustees at their February
1997 meeting, but led members of the
Board's multicultural committee on a tour
of campus facilities and helped organize
a 150 student demonstration and in the
bitter cold as well. .

Thakkar‘s work did thejob. In April,
1997, the Board of Trustees formed a
subcommittee to investigate the issue.

Carlos Eduardo Macias ‘99 thinks this
is a step in the right direction. Born in
Guadalajara, Mexico, Macias is a busy
student who works fourjobs and ﬁlls his
time with several campus activities, in-
cluding serving as Student Organization
of Latinos/Latinas [SOL] membership
president, an active multicultural peer as-
sistant, and serving as a leadership train-
ing officer for the collegiate leadership
network sponsored by the National His—
panic Institute. He is among many who
have been personally involved with the
space issue.

“Speaking for myself, I‘ve found the
need for space is hard for some students
to understand, but its necessary" said
Macias, speaking in the windowless SOL
ofﬁce, about the size of a Read single,
located in the basement of the Forum.
“Everyday that I walk around campus, I
am forced to be a representative of my
culture. Everywhere I go, I am often the
only Mexican American, the only Latino
that many people know. It is natural to
be curious but I ﬁnd myself often having
to he a representative for what my cul-
ture is. Space for me is kind of like a safe

place where] don’t have to act like a rep-
resentative of my culture, because no
matter what someone may think, if you
are acting as a representative for your
culture, you cannot always act the way
you’d like to."

"When I‘m in my dorm, people are
more likely to ask me to turn down my
music if I‘m playing Vicente Fernddnez,
a popular Mexican singer, then if I’m
playing Pearl Jam at the same level," said
Macias. “I need a place to vent some-
times. All I’m saying is that ifI had
space, it would be a place where I could
play my music, It would be a place where
SOL members and students outside SOL
could come to have a forum for culture
and for personal growth.

“Many students can‘t imagine that
there are people here who don’t have any
space at all, I strongly encourage any-
one with questions to ask me.

Another student, who wished not to
be identiﬁed, also felt a need for space.
“I think the campus atmosphere is gen-
erally accepting, but there are issues that
need to be addressed. The lack of diver-

Give credit where credit’s due: Groups seek accreditation
Experimental College in second year,

expands focus and enrollment

BY CHRIS NEARY
StaffWriter
. While plowing through
courses like sociology,
calculus and Spanish,
many a Grinnell scholar
has wished for courses
that are little bit more tai-
lored to their own some-
what quirky interests.
Since the spring 1997 se-
mester at Grinnell, those
students have had a
chance to take courses
like Advanced Knitting, of Knitting
Stanley Kubrick's World,
and Bridge 101 through the Experimen-
tal College [EXCO].

EXCO, which was founded last year,
has boomed this semester to included 270
students participating in 28 classes. With
overwhelming student support in only its
second semester of operation, Jeri Sandler
‘98, head ofthe student run organization,
feels that EXCO classes ought to be nor
credited in the future.

“Giving credit for EXCO courses is
important because it would legitimize stu-
dents initiative to take classes," she said.
“That recognition 'would fit well with the
Grinnell commitment to learning for its
own sake and sharing of knowledge. To
me that is a true liberal arts cducation."

Shannon Anderson, who is cnrolled in
“The Literature of Tom Robbins", feels
that the amount of time spent inside and

outside of EXCO classes would validate
accrediting them.

“ You do put in a lot of time in the
class,"Anderson said. “I‘m reading about
150 pages and I’m learning a lot about
Tom Robbins’ style and literature. If you
put In the time for EXCO classes you
should get some kind of credit."

In an effort to allow students to take
EXCO classes for credit, the EXCO comr
mittce is working on creating an evalua-
tion system to determine whether the
classes are worthy of credit. In addition
to evaluation sheets, a student initiate will
be held next fall to delennine whether stu-
dents want accredited EXCO classes or
not. Sandler feels that one of the reasons
EXCO classes should be accredited is the
Experimental College can offer courses

Bike theft linked to drugs

BY ERIN HUSTLNGS
Editor-in-Cliief

Bike theft on campus, historically the
most common crime reported by students,
has recently been linked to rumors of il-
legal drug trade in the town of Grinnell,

Although authorities said they had not
heard ofor investigated any such connec-
tion, one anonymous source, a resident
ofGrinnell, said that it is acommon prac-
[ice for town drug users to steal bikes,
especially on the college campus, to trade
for illegal substances such as the form of
methamphetamine known as crank.

Stolen parts are sometimes reas-
sembled into new, less recognizable bi-
cycles, according to this informant. “I
knew somcoilc whose bike was stolen,"
he recalled. “A few weeks later this per
son saw someone riding a bike that was
half his, and he asked the rider about it.
The guy with bike said, ‘Yeah, I traded
half of this for crank.”

Craig Cooper, owner of Bikes To You,
confirmed that he had seen some bikes
that were obviously made from an array
of different original bicycles, and thus
most likely stolen property. He said, how-
ever, that he believes that most bikes taken
from campus and the town of Grinnell are

“moved somewhere else and sold quickly.
Most stolen bikes never surface here."

Cooper also commented that he be
lleved there had been a resurgence in bir
cycle theft in Grinnell in the past six
months after a small decline. Police and
campus administrators were unable to
provide ﬁgures by which to compare re
cent trends, but Director of Housing Steve
Larson said that since the beginning of
this semester, students have reported ﬁve
bikes stolen. Two of these have been re
covered .

A rise in the occurrence of bike theft
may be evidence of increasing usage of
methamphetamine-based substances in
the Midwestern states. According to Part-
nership for a Drug-Free America, crank,
also known as ice, can cause “erratic, vio-
lent behavior among its users." Crank Is
also “an extremely addictive stimulant,”
and may induce users to resort to extreme
measures, such as theft, to satisfy their
physical need for the drug.

Students seem to be ofthe opinion that
the stealing of bicycles is a significant
problem, and their concern is heightened
by allegations of drug involvement.

Disgruntled publication employees
desire adequate compensation

BY LAUREN WOLFE
Staff Writer

Some students would like to see the
work they put into college publications
rewarded with academic credit. The col-
lege, however, is remaining ﬁrm in its
stand against awarding credits to student-
run and student-supervised extracurricu-
lar activities,

Currently, students involved in college
publications receive minimal salaries and
no credit. Quite a few joumalism-mindod
Grinnellians are disgruntled over the lack
of adequate Compensation they feel their
hard work deserves.

“It is necessary that the school recog-
nize that there is learning going on in the
publications ofﬁce." said Cyclone editor
Ali Neff ‘99. “At the same time, there is
a lot of grunt work going on. In this light
it is apparent that editing Or working for
a publications is both rigorous and didac-
tic: that it exceeds the amount of energy
that most, if not all, students put into one
four-credit class."

Scarlet and Black editor Erin Hustings
‘98 agrees that students involved in pub-
lications should be getting credit for their
effort, especially for the time commitment
it involves. “We should be getting credit
for our work primarily because this is
timerconsuming, and working for publi-
cations is deﬁnitely a learning process,"
she said. “If you consider the amount of
time we spend putting the paper together
as compared to our salaries — well, it’s

certainly not minimum wage; we’re all
doing a good bit of community service
for the college."

Time and energy considerations put
aside, the work put into publications and
the practical skills gained by that work
are “very much a valid part of a liberal
arts curriculum," said Neff. “There is no
doubt in my mind that I have learned
more from my extensive work on vari-
ous publications at this school than from
my regular curriculum."

Hustings said, “We’re all gaining
knowledge about practical, real-life
skills, producing hard evidence of our
work — it’s a lot like an internship."

In fact, one major question raised has
been: why do internships get credit for
the work done there when similar work
that is done at the college gets no aca-
demic credit? i

According to Dean of Faculty Charles
Duke, internships are guided experien-
tial learning, and the college is able to
take an active role in the internship pro-
gram through faculty advisers and spon-
sors. “"l'here‘s a process that the faculty
has approved," he said. “It's that whole
process that makes [internships] part of
the academic program.”

“The faculty as a whole," continued
Dean Duke, “decided that activities such
as publications were separate from the
curriculum [We’ve] always said that
these activities are important, and [we]
strongly support them, but they're just

New GiLBT roup formed

Queer People of Co or seeks empowerment

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Queer People of Color (QPOC) is a
new group on campus. It was created to

provide a safe and comfortable environ-

ment in which minority gay, lesbian, bi-
sexual and transgendered (GLBT) stu-
dents can discuss issues. QPOC plans to
ﬁll a void for students “with their own
issues who don’t feel comfortable being
part ofa forum who can’t relate," said co-
founder Gabe Rodriguez ‘00. “For as lib»
eral as Grinnell is...[it] can be a very hos»
tile environment," he added.

Rodriguez and Liz Lee ‘99 founded the

organization not only to discuss queer is:

sues, but to discuss minority issues as
well. Lee said that “being queer and be-
ing colored [are] both of the same prior-
ity." Rodrigucz said they hope to create a
“safe place where queer people of color
can discuss the intricacies of being mi<
notity as well as homosexual.”

There are “people who do not under»
stand the pressures of being a colored
person in America, but also a queer per—
son," Rodriguez said, but the feedback has
been “mostly supportive."

Although the issues QPOC discusses
are not foreign to other campus organiza-

tions, Lee describes it as a “totally dif-
ferent perspective." It creates a venue in
which people who are uncomfortable can
discuss from a similar perspective and
relate to each other.

QPOC chose not to be associated with
any other campus cultural group because
afﬁliation with another group puts them
in a “minimized status," Lee said.
Rodriguez said that it‘s important for mi-
nority GLBT students, and for the orga-
nization, to “stand up on [their] own."

‘At QPOC’s first meeting this past
Tuesday, Lee said she felt “comfortable
for the first time in a long time,"
Rodriguez felt that the ﬁrst meeting was
\vbry sudcessful, conﬁrming that “there
is a deﬁnite need for [QPOC]."

QPOC meetings aim to set a very rev
laxed atmosphere, and center around in
formal discussion.

Not only does QPOC act as a discus-
sion group, however, it is also a resource,
a way to “contribute to the gay commu-
nity from our perspective," said
Rodriguez. He is quick to point out that
“we‘re not here to divide the commu»
nity," rather to “afﬁrm our role in it.“

QPOC is based around GLBT students
and minorities, but the organization is
open to the entire campus,
