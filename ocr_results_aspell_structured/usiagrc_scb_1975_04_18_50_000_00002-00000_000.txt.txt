SA posts

With the selection at Student
Advisors for 1975 completed, a
disproportionate number, only one
third oi them, are women. Out oi
the total 55 SAs, whose names and
floors will be announced Sunday,
only 17 are women. or the at total
applicants, 30 were Women. The
same number of men and women,
13, was rejected.

Associate Dean of Student Al‘s
fairs Dianne Ruyffeleare was
hard pressed to make any
speculations on the reasons for this
situation, For instance, she did not
think the low number of women
applicants was because men tend
to have more experience or a
desire to function in advising
capacities. In fact, she said, “It
would seem to me that more
women would apply than men
because the SA role is one which
more women have Chosen to
participate in than men.”

Coincidence appears to 'be the
culprit Her theory was damaged
however, when she discovered that
a similar Situatlon occurred last
year, cut or so SAs, only 18 were
women “I havc no way to account
for it,” she said And she did not
think the inequality was due to any
bias on the part of the selection
committee or speciiic iiaws in the
selection process. since people are
chosen according to merit rather
than sex.

Ruyffelaere |S Coordinating
evaluations of both the SA and RA
programs, expected to be com»
pleted in the next couple or weeks,
(Coming issues of the S 8: B will
investigate this.) The SA selection
process is just one oi many aspects
being Considered in the
evaluations, One ot the major
consistent comments on surveys
about the SA system was that the
selection process needs work.

Ruyffelaere explained the
procedure. In choosing an SA, two
basic qualities are looked for.
First, the student’s “committment
to wanting to be an SA,” and
secondly, his or her “recep-
tiveness,” casiness to talk to and
get along with. Ruyffelaere said
these qualities are hard to define
and determine, since “so much of
it is personality and guessing.”

These two qualities are deter-
mined and the applicant iurtlier
evaluated by iive means, none or
which necessarily weighs more
than any other:

1) personal statement, which
discusses why the individual wants
to be an SA and his or or her ex-
perience,

27 evaluations by til) per cent of
the floor members.

3) hall otticer‘s evaluations,
done by coordinators, reps and
SAS, consider how the person will
be able to integrate into the hall
Situation,

4) RA‘S evaluation in the form of
a personal interview.

5) group interviews in the iorm
oi a group exercise, in which the
members lnust work together
efficiently to complete a given
task

Ruyffelaere has claimed, in

answer to criticism that this should
not replace a personal interview,

that one can find out more in a
group situation than on a one-tea
one basis, one discovers how a
person responds to other people
and iunctions in a group. This is
important, she felt, since much of
an SA'S work tends to be on a group
level, whether as social organizer
or mediator.

Again she stressed that the
relative nature of the parts ot the
process, saying that even it one
had a poor interview, but ”Stellar"
recommendations, that person
would most likely be selected.

Major criticisms of the selection
process have centered around the
validity oi the group exercise, the
vagueness oi the floor evaluations
and that the tact that RAS were
often asked to evaluate someone
they hardly knew.

D'ean
disputes
counselor

Diane Ruyflelaere, associate
dean oi students, expressed her
disagreement with Mitch Kelber's
causes [or turning down a month
long position as an alcohol counr
selor.

Ruyitelaere, in a letter sent to
Kelber, disputed Kelber’s
reﬂections on Grinnell College.
The letter was punctuated with
reiutations oi Kclher's key reasons
for changing his plans, alter he had
originally accepted the counseling
job.

Kelber's apprehension that
Grinnell was not interested in
becoming involved in ongoing
counseling headed Ruyffelaere‘s
list in the letter. According to
Ruyffelaere, this assumption “is
not at all true.” Students “need
time and exposure to a person in
order to develop a sense of trust,"
and atter the counselors stay, a
followup program would be imr
portant, Ruyffelaere stated. The
task of tackling an alcohol problem
necessitates a counselor Htn
realize this and adjust their ex-
pectations accordingly," she
added,

Ruyttelaere was puzzled by
Kelber's attitude that the couns
seiing position was going to be used
as a legal force to handle problem
drinking on campus As she sees it,
Kelbcr was asked during an in-

tion of your (Kelber) becoming
involved in setting up any program

stated in the letter,

Kelber had Claimed that
drinking was ”too much part or the
Social life,” to be Viewed as a
problem by Grinnell students.
.Assigning this characteristic to

correct by Ruytielaere, She ielt
that Kelber had better realize that
the problem oi people being taken
by social norms is not “unique“ to
Grinnell if he is “sincerely in

students in the future.”

The end of the letter expressed
the need to alleviate the drinking
problem. Ruyiielaere suggested
that any help Kelber could offer
would be appreciated.
