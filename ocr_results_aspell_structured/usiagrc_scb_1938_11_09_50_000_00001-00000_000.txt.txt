Huffman Modern
‘Live, Fresh and

By Henry Alden

Last night F. Walter Huffman,
assisted by Sarah MacDonald and
a string quartet comprising David
E. Peck, Margaret Bates, Char-
lotte niche, and Charlotte Car-
mah, presented a recital of mod-
ern songs. An appreciative audi-
ence responded cordially to this
music that was to most of us
somewhat bewildering, but “in-
terasting."

Theoretically contemporary mu-
sic, like contemporary literature
and art, should express in artis-
tic form the essence of contem-
porary civilization. I have no
doubt that it does precisely this.
Therefore, we should respond al-
most intuitively to modern music
as the expression of our most
precious ideas and emotions.

The fact that we are baffled
by modern music may mean sim-
ply that the artist is always

Lookabaugh Gives
Chalk Talks, Light
Workouts to Squad

By Clark Smith.

.Coach Guy Lookabaugh this week
took the pressure off his Pioneers
for the rest of the season with
the hope that injured squadmen
will have time tn recover for the
next two contests with Coe and
Colorado colleges. If victories are
to be gained in these contests, the
squad must be at full strength
as both opponents are to be re<
spected.

Friday afternoon the hotly con-
tested series with Moray Eby’s
Kohawks of Goe, at cedar Rapids,
will be resumed. The cold weath~
er and snow has hampered both
teams considerably in the pre-
paration for the contest.

Chalk Talk.

Monday the Pioneers conlined
their activities to a chalk talk
and some instructions as to how
to meet the Due attack. The
charging Kohawk line and the
speedy backs are expected to give
Giinnell a full afternoon Friday.
In line with the new policy of
lighter work for the squad, Look-
abaugh sent the men through
brief limbering up exercises be-
fore dismissing them from prac-
tice last night.

it is doubtful if Howard Grimes,
bulwark of the center of the line,
will have his injured leg ready to
see full time service Friday. paul
Baichly, end, is confined to the
hospital with an infection from a
cut on his face. Baichly will prob-
ably be out of action entirely.

Homanu's Lag Improves,

Fred Homann'a leg is on the
mend, and he will undoubtedly be
ready for service in the fullback
position. Behind the line with Ho-
mann in the starting lineup prob-
ably will be Edward waiters and
George Little, halfbacks, and Vern
Robinson at quarter. Little's out-
standing play against the Icha-
bods may give him preference
over Robert Moehl.

Edward Vaughn may start at
center in place of the injured
Grimes while Raymond Crossman ,
will start at Baichly’s post at end.
The balance of the line will re-
main the same as it was against
washburn.

Hope for Dry Field.

The Pioneers are hoping for a
dry, fast field at Cedar Rapids.
This will give their running at-
tack, headed by Edward Walters
and Fred Lumer, a chance to
click.

Their passing attack, which
showed an improvement last sat-
urday, will also have a better
chance to function under such
conditions.

Niemeyer to Review Book
For Mortar Board Friday

Mortar Board, senior women's
honorary scholastic society, will
sponsor a Social Budget book re~
view tes Friday afternoon from
4 to 5 o'clock in Main drawing
room.

Carl Niemeyer. instructor in
English, will review a new book,
“U. S. 1.," by Muriel Rukeyser.
