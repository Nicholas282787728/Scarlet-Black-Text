Tl-E DEATH OF ORPEEUS

This film is intended to treat the problem of what is set down
beforehand and what is not. In short -— of free Will.

Death in the film'is not Death, symbolicallyrepresented by an
elegant young woman, 'but is Orpheus' own death. Each one of us
possesses his own death, which takes care of him from the moment
of his birth. Orpheus' Death...exoeeds her powers...

The writer wanted to toﬁoh on the most serious problems with a
light hand and without philosophizing; in a void‘; The film is
therefore a detective picture which touches on myth on the one
hand, on the supernatural on the other.

...The closer one approaches to mystery, the more important it
becomes to remain a realist. Radios in automobiles, code messages,
short wave braodoasts, power failures, are so many elements fami—
liar to all, and make it possible...to keep things down to earth.

Orpheus' Death and ﬁertebise reproach him for asking questions.
To seek to understand, this is the strange mnnj‘a of men.

10, in ARH auditorium.
