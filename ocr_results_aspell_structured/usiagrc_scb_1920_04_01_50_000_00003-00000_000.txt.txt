“Dllﬂ” WATSUN. is
NEW BUAGH

Doc Watson, present coach at Iowa,
has been elected new Pioneer coach,
according to an announcement made
late today.

Among the ﬁrst applications to he _

received for position of toothall coach
at Grinnell was that of conch ”Zip”
Zupplie of Illinois. Some of his rea-
sons for applying were, lack of matere
lal at the institution where he is at
present coaching, continual, quarreling
with the athletic board over a slight
increase in wages which he has been
demanding for solne time.

It has also developed that "Doc"
Willidlrls' name was another on the
list 0! the defeated and disheartened.
He intimated .that the student-body
was growing a hit cold in their sup-
port toward him, and the statement
had issued treat the faculty that they
would be much better pleased if he
could tllrn out a winning teanl ztt least
once or twice while he was there.

“Hur . Up" Yost of Michigan gave
as credentials that he had turned out
the biggest string of defeats in the
Big Ten, and claimed that his players
could pull more freak plays and bone-
heads than the combined members of
the other nine-tenths. J,

"Jumbo" Stielml of Indiana gave as
his principal reason for desiring a
change the fact that he was going
deal from the noise the Boilermakers
had been making of late. Gilmore
D‘ohie of the Navy said he wished to
get to higher. drier ground, and far-
ther inland. Percy Houghton or Har-
vard. wished to assure himself of a
pension in the form or a life coaching
job. hence his application.

The ﬁnal selection falls upon "Doc"
tWatSon of Iowa. In a recent letter
“Doc" admitted he was the best coach
‘in the United states, and the iaculty
decided to take his recommendation.
