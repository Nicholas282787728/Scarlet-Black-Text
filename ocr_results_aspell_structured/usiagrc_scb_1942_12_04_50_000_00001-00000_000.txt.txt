‘Action on Ashtray Problem
Up to Council’ --- Gleason

The problem of dining room
Smokingiwim or without the
college's streamlined ash trays—
was put squarely hack in the lap
of the student wunc‘ll. last night
when Miss Nellie Gleason, direc-
tor of foods, to whom that body
had posed the problem several
weeks ago. said she had taken ab-
solutely no action upon, intended
to take no action upon it, and did
not consider it wimln the proper
scope of her activities.

However, mas Gleason em-
phasised that she is willing and
anxious to tails over the whole
problem with student council
representatives it and when an
()1de delegation approached
her with a clear statement of
the problem and their suggestions
for solving it,

“As a matter of not, I have
never been formally notified of
the council's desire for me to take
action," she said last night. “The
first 1 knew or the whole thing
was by reading the story which

Special Traffic
Rules Approved

To facilitate marching formations

from barracks to class buildings,
special traffic regulations for
Park street have been approved
by the Grinnell city council, Col.
William 0. Hammond, post com-
mandant, announced last night.

No vehicles may be parked on,
either side of that street between
Eight and Tenth avenues. or on
the east side of Park between

These regulations are effective

appeared in the Scarlet and Black.

“Since that time no one has
been to see me officially about it,
though many students were at
first concerned over a possible
rescinding of the smoking privi»
lege."

Miss Gleason said that thus
far she had not even considered
a curtailment or smoking in the
dining room and did not believe
such decisions were hers to make
in any event.

The housekeeping department
did conduct an informal "search-
ing party" for the missing ash
trays immediately after the coun-
cil's suggestion was made, Miss
Gleason said, but none of the
elusive saucers were uncovered,
and the plan was abandoned

At the time of the disappear-
ance of the first' trays, Miss
Gleason announced that the food
department did not intend to re-
placc them. such replacement
