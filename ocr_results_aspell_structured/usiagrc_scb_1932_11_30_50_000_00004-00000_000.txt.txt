THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1932.

 

By aux ROSS
If ever one major college football
eleven put another major team more
completely to rout than did Mar-
querte‘s Golden Avalanche swttmp
.Drake university last Saturday, it is

as yet unheard Of. The score was,

4570, but the most alarming fact of
all is that Bulldog runners carried
the ball 21 times, and yet could only
gain a total of seven yards. They
tried five passes, none of which were
complete, and Marquette outgained
them. 19 first downs to none.

Football followers need not expect
any immediate decion on who the.
selections nill be for the Tournament
oi Ro. s gllnu‘ in Los . igclcs New
Years Day. Southern California must
play Notrc name as 3 t, imd if the
Irish continue, their nuiiiing stride,
the. Trojans may be too severely ont-
pinyed and not get the coil.

r s e

If the game is close, however, it
is probable that they will re resent
the west in the annual classic. The
east right now is likely to he repre-
sented by Coach Andy Kerr‘s tricky
Colgate eleven, which has gone
through the 1932 season unbeaten.
untied, and unseored upon.

a a ..

There is a chance that the Rose
Bowl authorities will choose Pitts-
burgh or Michigan, both unbeaten,
but with not so strong a record as
Colgate's Red Raiders can show.
Pitt has been tied twice. and even
outplayed, while Michigan bu not
been very impressive in its Big Ten
schedule. The Wolverines looked ear
lrecially bad against Princeton.

i n e

Personally. I think that Colgate
has proved beyond any shadow of a
doubt her right to go west. She has
beaten Columbia, N. Y. U,. Penn
State, Syracuse, and Brown. some of
the outstanding teams of the cast.
Her record of keeping her goal line
unerossed in major competition
should show that her baffling, de-
ceptive running attack is not her solo
asset,

RADIO RAMBLINGS

With Ted Husing's broadcast from
Philadelphia of the traditional Army-
Navy football conflict Saturday, the
WABC—Columhia network completes
its schedule of football broadcasts for
the 1932 season, unless late arrange—
ments might provide ‘for the broad-
casting of any postseason games of
importance. Husing will start his
broadcast of the interesting service
team struggle at 12; o p. m. EST.

On the eve of the same game, Frie
day, Christy Walsh will stage a dis~
tinct innovation in radio by present-
ing the two coaches of the rival
temsiEdgar “Rip" Miller of the
Navy, and Major Ralph I. Sa’sse, of
the Army—as his interview guests
during the All-American football
show, to be broadcast over WABC
and Columbia from 9 to 9:30 p. m.,
'EST.

Miller, one of many Rocknertrained
‘coac‘hes, starred at Notre Dame as a
tackle. Graduating in 1925, he was
a team-mate of the famed “Four
Horsemen." all of whom are also
prominent as coaches. He became
head coach at Annapolis last year, af—
ter serving for three years as line
vcoach. He also has coached at Indi-
ana and at Xavier.

Major Sasse‘ was originally sched-
uled for a. previous appearance on
the same series, which was cancelled
in deference to a special campaign
broadcast. As Army regulations limit
the head coach's tenure of his post
to four years, the next afternoon's
game will he the last in which a
:Sasse-coachecl Army team will take
the field. Sasse is unique in the fact
that he is an amateur coach, for at
West Point coaching posi ons are a
‘matter of Army orders, bringing no
remuneration other than the regular
Army salary. A West Point graduate
of 1916, Sassc shone as an end on
the Army team, later serving for six
years as assistant coach before his
present appointment. He has estab~
lished an exceptionally creditable
record at West Point, where his
teams have consistently rated among
'the cnuntry's most powerful football
aggregations.

The Pioneers led in second team

No Great Ends
There were no really great ends,
although Rigney of Oklahoma A. and
M. and Duncan of Crinneli played
good football. Duncan was not up to
his 1931 standard. and only nosed
out his teammate, McKee, by a slen-
der margin.
At the tackle positions, we find
perhaps the most underrated player

in this conference or any conference.

sturdy Pioneer tackle who turned in

tacular plays. Hc cooperated splend-

Guards Sen roe

Guard material was rather scarce,
but Duprec of the Aggies and Mar-
chetti of Creighton won out over
Roschbloom of Grinnell, Bowers Of
Drake. and Tomlinson of Creighton.

Captain Turner of the Aggies was
the outstanding man of the loop at
the pivot position. while Pickett of
Creighton was narrowly given pref-
erence over McMillin of Srinnell,
whose work was not as consistent
throughout the year as that of the
Bluejay center.

Among the backfield candidates
for all-Valley honors was such a fine
array of stars that the leading Scor—
er of the league had to be relegated
to the second team. Two great triple-
threat stars were Highfill, Cowboy
quarterback, and Collin, Bluejay half-
and they, like Ullrich of Crinnell and

PROGRAMMINGS

Nino Martini, young Italian tenor,
has been signed by the Columbia
broadcasting system for bi~weekly
recitals of operatic and concert arias
to be broadcast from 11:00 to 11:30
p.m., EST, Tuesdays and Thursdays,
with the Columbia symphony orches-
tra.

Although he is only 26 years old,
Martini has already achieved an in-
ternational reputation in operatic and
concert circrcs. He is the only living
tenor whose voice range spans more
than two and a half octaves.

He sings F above high ”C" in
full voice, a feat which makes him
the only artist of the present day
capable of singing the tenor role of
Bellini's opera, “1 Puritani", in its
original key.

The young tenor broke a precedent
of long standing at the Opera House
in Philadelphia last January when,

Register Mentions

Seven Pioneers
in Valley Choices

chen Pioneer gr stars were men—
tioned in the Des Moines Registers
selections for the 1932 AlleMissourl
Valley teams.

Dick Ullrich, and Hank Duncan
gained places on the first eleven and
Capt. Fritz Craflund was given a
second team berth. McKee, Gould.
Rosenbloom, and Bowlby were given
honorable mention.

In commenting on the selections,
Sec Taylor, Register sports editor,
said that Ullricn was shifted from
his regular position at quarterback
to half to make room for Highfill,
Oklahoma Aggie signal caller, and
also because he was placed there by
most of the votes.

“Ullricll is one of the most versa-
tile ohd dangerous backs ever (levels
oped in this state and is deserving
of the best two ends in the confers
lor,

The writer also called Duncan one
of the best two ends in tlic confcr~
euce.

Duncan was the only G- ‘nncll
player to make the f at team, in the
Omaha World Heralds selections, ai»
though McKee and Ullricli made the
second eleven.
