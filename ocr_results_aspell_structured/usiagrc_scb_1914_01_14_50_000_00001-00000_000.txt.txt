Saturday night. The rooms of the As-

Probably the best game oi the even-

found out to their sorrow that he
had a game to ﬁt each man, \velch

The system employed by My, Bu Ii

Coach Is Nou-Committal,

Coach Fisher, with true coaching
conservatism, maintains that the learn
is no belter, no, not as good, as last
year, because the men haven't the ﬁght
nor the team—work. and we are “weak
on guards and forwards and centel .”
Whether coach really believes this, or
\vhelher he says it from coaching prin—
ciples, he will not disclose.

When questioned concerning ludi—

admitted that ”yes. Sherman has as
much guarding ability as any man on
the team last year; and Tharp is).
