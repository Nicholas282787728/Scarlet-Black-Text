October 2 2009

 

This position is occupied by Neal wepk-
ing'10.Wepk'ing believes that more attention
should be given to his position when deciding who to purchase
food product from.

"I feel like it would be good to have more power, but all I
can do is make suggestions to [Williams] and [Waltersdorf],"
Wepking said.

Mr. Dunharn believes that Wepking's position in Dining
Services is a key role in increasing the amount or local foods
that are brought to the campus.

“I think that’s a great ﬁrst step, the problem With having
that [position] be a student internship is that he doesn‘t have
any purchasing power,” Mr. Dunham said. ”He‘s not perma-

SHIC

from p. 1 Center (SRC) did not offer comprehensive

sexual health resources. “There wasn‘t a set

place to discuss sexual health issues and to learn about them,

and I think especially on a college campus it’s a really important
resource to have.”

once Bernstein returned from abroad she approached
Asani' Seawell Psychology, who specializes in health psychol—
ogy, who worked with Bernstein and Lynne Choilet on 2 Men-
tored Advanced Project (MAP) that investigated sexual health
resources on campus.

Over the course of the summer, Bernstein and Chollet pre-
sented their ﬁndings to SL’udentAffairs and the Health Center.
By mideJuly they were awarded the space that once housed the
Stonewall Resource Center (SRC) for the current academic
yeariThe SHIC provides two basic services to the campus mm,
munitystlie Safer Sex Supplies Store and access to peer educa—
torsThe store sells 23 different types of condoms in addition
to a number of lubricants, at prices ranging from 5 to 25 cents.

Though the SHIC is not legally able to administer Plan B
emergency contraceptives, pregnancy tests will be available to
students for in during regularly scheduled ofﬁce hours.

Peer educators of the SHIC are students trained to answer
questions and to assist students with issues of sexual health,
including disease and pregnancy testing and problems with
mental health. Students can attend free appointments with
peer counselors on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from
o- s p in, Tuesday and Friday from H pm. and on Sunday
from 12 3 p. m.

For students who feel uncomfortable talking about' issues
of sexual health with peers, they have institutionalized means
where they can talk to someone who’s been trained," said Rag-
nar Thorisson’11,n peer educatorr

The center has an email usernamc, [SHIC], in addition to
‘an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) screen namegrinnellshic,
for those who are not comfortable meeting face-to-face with a
peer educator. In the future, the center plans to compile an act
cessible Library for additional sexual health information. Addi—
tionally, there are plans to provide opportunities for students to
test their sexual health know-how and to expand their knowls
edge. Future workshops will include queer sex education with
StoneCo, and a discussion on virginity, allowing students who
are not sexually active to benefit from the SHIC'spresence on
campus.

SEG

from p. 1 Wiley ‘09 said.

This degree of commitment both to one
another and to their cause was ofthe essence to SEG as they
embarked on their journey to becoming a non-proﬁt‘NGO.
Though a seemingly straightforward process a single form
the road to completing the application for 501c(3) status,
was a long haul.

“The form is daunting but fairly clear, RooreWiley said.
“We had weekly subgroup meetings. There were‘cight if us
or so who worked on this form for around six months.”

By gaining 501c(3) status, 51-20 will now be recognized
not only by rinnell College but also by the state of Iowa
andthe United States ofAmerica as a non— profit organiza-
tion.

“It opens us up to other resources that other organizas
tions have formed to assist nonspmﬁts. There is a world of
non- proﬁt support resources that this kind of gives us ac-
cess to Root Wiley said Forexamplc all donations to SEG
will now be tux exempt. This will provide benefactors with a
greater incentive to donate.

SEG hopes that the taxodeductablc perk that comes with
NGO status pwill help attract more donors, and connections
with other organizations and individuals abroad “I really
want to see more direct partnerships,which is a struggle. But
I think that it is worth it and now that we have significant
backing it will be a lot easier just because we are not going
through the school anymore—we are going to have our own
resources," Radcrsrrong said. “This is definitely something
to be proud of and we hope that the campus can recognize
this and that the administration can recognize this and start
working with us as a partner instead oras a student group."

nent. Though, that’s a much better internship than what they
may have done in the past."

Having a Local Foods Intern isnt the onlyway that Dining
services can be pushed to incorporate more local ingredients.
Mr. Dunharn believes that the student body‘ plays a key role
in increasing the amount oflocal foods that are purchased by
the college.

“I drink it would be great for students to push for more
labeling in the dining hall,” said Mr. Dunham. “Figuring out
whether they brought this directly from a farmer or either
through [corporate food distributor] SYSCO or another food
service provider."

Wepking also believes that students play a large role in

bringing local foods to the campus.

“I think it would be great ifstudents really pushed hard for
[local foods]," Wepking said.

In addition to students playing a larger role in the local
foods scene on campus, Wepking believes that some of the
blame can be placed on the structure of the dining hall.

"They are very ingrained in the system they are working
with,"Wepking said, “When you look at it from their perspec-
tive, they don’t quite see the ethical and social reasons we are
trying to buy local food. Unless they can learn that, it's hard to
get them to change."
