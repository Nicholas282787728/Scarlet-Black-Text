Watching the White Sox clinch the
World Series title in Game 4 last week,
like many I couldn’t help but be moved
by the occasions historically symbolic
value.

Eightyeight years had passed since
the last White Sox Championship. Ear—
ly in the streak in 1919 eight White Sox
players agreed to take bribes to throw

. the World Series in what became known
as the “Black Sox scandal.” The trans-
gression led to the eight players being
banned from the major leagues for life:
it was, in a sense, major league baseball's
original sin, the sacriﬁce of immortality
for money

In fact, the scandal affected the
American psyche so deeply that the
character of “Shoeless”Joe Jackson, one
of the eight, was a central figure in the
movie “Field of Dreams" 70 years later.

For 86 years after the scandal the
White Sox existed in a type of sports
purgatory never winning a World Series
but, perhaps worse, never gaining the fan
devotion of more popular teams like the
Cubs, Red Sox and Yankees. A religious
person might attribute the long years of

punishment of a transgressor of God’s
laws.

As a baseball fan who likes to take
the game much more seriously than it
actually is, I would leC to t ik that the
Sox wandered the desert for nearly nine
decades in penance for the willingness
ofa few to place frnancial gain over what
many American children (and grown
men) only dream of: a chance to win the
World Series.

The scandal was not isolated in mac
jot league baseball either, as gambling
and cheating have been regular occur-
rences among even the greatest players.
'Pete Rose's expulsion from baseball for
betting and the use of corked bats on the
field is one example.

Perhaps this World series represents
the moral redemption ofa franchise, and
a part of baseball, rather than the mere
superstitious redemption of the Red Sox
last year in the destruction of”the curse
ofthe Babe."

Regardless, the 50x world champir
onship can give us perspective on our
lives as individuals and (for many of us)

This is because, in some ways, the

is representative of the paradox of the '
