The pair of triumphs were made
even sweeter hy the fact that each

cance as well as of inter-conference
importance.

COLLEGE UNNECESSARY
(NSFA)—In answer to a qunstlon»
nnire sent out to Princeton graduates
of the class of 1922, titty-six alumni
stated that In their opinion the aver-
age girl can struggle through life
pretty nicely with the equivalent of a
high school education and that they
would not send their daughters to
college. One said that he planned to
do so until he had taught for a. while
at e co-educationht collegeiNew

RUSSIAN SCHOOLS (mowmm

(NSFA)—Russinn schools are so
crowded that even small children
must attend classes for a new hours
during the day and then work on a.
night shift, according to an Amerr
icon student who has just returned
from a year of teaching at Tomsk.
Anyone expressing a Christian belief
is harred from the schools.—Nortb-
east Missourian.

However, the battle of Bulldogs will
be overshadowed by the Creighton-
Washington setto nilled for st.
Louis, Mo. Should the Bears win,
they will probably tie the Oklahoma
Aggies for the loop crown, since the
two teams do not meet.

The Cowboys play Tulsa at Tulsa
while Grinnell has an open date.

"It is a great temptation",

added, “for those who are sheltered
