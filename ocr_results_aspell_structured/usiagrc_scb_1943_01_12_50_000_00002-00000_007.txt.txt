Poverty Is Only Entrance Requirement

The ‘Harvard’ of the Poor

Forty years ago Berry College, located in the red clay hills ot the
Blue Ridge mountains at Georgia, consisted of a tiny log cabin and
had an enrollment of three students. Today, through the prodigious
work at its founder, Martha Berry, the school has become one at the
greatest in the nation, and its 5,000 annual waiting list is the largest
in the world.

 

 

 

Originally the school accommodated students from Georgia alone, but
now the enrollment is representative at the entire south. Less than eight
per cent at the 1,200 young men and women enrolled pay anything
in cash for room, board and tuition, working in school shops, farms,
dairies, kitchens, bakeries, weaving roorns, orchards, poultry lots, brick
plants, nurseries or others ot the 25 industries.

Gifts to Berry come tram people in every walk at lite e tram presidents

of the United States to a widow who sold her coat to make a con-
tribution. There is no "hired help“ at the school. All the work is done
by students. Roads are built, meals are prepared and served, shops '
and forms are operated by the boys and girls.

Now, the school that started with a solitary log cabin is a modern
educational institution with more than 100 structures and the world’s
largest campus stretching aver 25,000 acres of land.

most of the students are in overalls. The Berry School gives them a chance to put
theories into practice.
