The Grinnell College Men’s Glee
club maintained Kl high standard of
musicianship in the long, varied pros
grain presented in Herrick chapel Fri—
day evening, under the direction of
Prof. David E. Perk,

Starting with a. boom. singing the
“Cossack War Song" by Parker, thc
glee club presented several Stirring,
powerful numbers. They included
"sailor's Song" by Wagner, and "Trim
Ship” by Crossc, ‘

For the first sole of the program
James lnielt sang "Dawn” by onrran.
accompanied by Eduard Shadbolt, The
number was Wells presented, and

supported by an excellent accompans '“e m

inlent, but did not evidence the spi t
and tooling shown in Mr. lniclt's en-
cox-e "Water Boy.”

Next Group Well Blended

The selections in the next group by
the club were less resonant and loud
than the earlier numbers, but showed
better ettcots of shading and blend-
ing. The songs were "Shoogy Shoo"
by Ambrosc Thaycr, "The Long Day
Closes" by Sullivan, and an encore.

Richard Gelston brought nut some
fine contrasts in the loud and soft bass
sages oi his (lute solo, ”Rossignolet
by Donionu His technique in the pet-7
icrinancc oi last runs and other showy
devices was exhibited to advantage
both in that number, and in an encore.

The blue lighting effect which ilood-
ed the stage with suit moonlight during
the singing of a group ot southern
‘melodies, enhanced the low, carciully
hlcndod, admirably shadcd pel'fnrm-
ance oi the songs. The group includ-
sd six iam' iar numbers: "Soon I'm
Goin' Home" by Lester, "I'm Wander-
in’" by Gaines, “Swing ‘Along Aloe”
by Kountz, ”My Lady Chloe" by
Cloughs Leighter, "h ah Lindy Lou”
by Srickland, and "Swing Along" by
Cook,

Solo By Spencer

Following these numbers John
Spencer played Bach's ”Arioso" as a
’cello solo, performing with his ac-
cnstomcd ease and ctlectivencss. His
first number and an encore were both
accompanied by Charles Halstead,
lllr. Halstsad played piano accompani-
ments ior all the numbers or the club
which required accompaniment, doing
his work with skill throughout,

The sccond basses and iii-st tenors
alternated in clever solo representa-
tions at "The Owl and thc Pussy Cat"
by DeKoven. James lniclt sang the
bass solo through the ”Gypsy c
Song" by victor Herbert, and again
had the solo part in “The Song or the
his Ba Viol" sung in response to an
enthusiastic encore. Thc accompamu
ing voices wcrc exceptionally well~
balanced and shaded, both in the ol»
gdnviuiletl accompaniment or "The
Gypsy Lavc Song," and in the string
tailed background oi "Tile Sons or
the Big Bass Viol."

Tho. traditional closins number.
"Alumni Song” by Otis-Olds brought
the concert to an cnd, Several tors
mer glee club members sang with the
present club members in thc inspirinz
pcrim-nmncc ol th classic ririnncll
collcgc song,

0n the whole, the thrcc high spots

in the evening were the group otnegro ,

spirituals, tho "Gypsy Love Song,"
and—as always—the “Alumni Sons."
which with good reason can bc called
the finest college song in America.

Horace Holmes was a weekend vi-
sitor in lowa City.

“We must chan ’e our thinking to

Di' Fisher stated "The East is no

ally all sections there are nationalist
slirring‘s, motivated by the desire for‘
independence, democracv and sell-

The wcstcrn world must tacc these
new conditions by ending its policy
or ruthless aggression, Dr. Fisher de»
clarcd. “The western nations must
realize," he said, "that the Asiatics
have higher claims to Asia. Bath
East and West must develop a spirit
or cooperation and recognize equality
or treatment as a primary need."

West Is Ugly

Dr. Fisher sketched the adjustment
that the West must innlé, “The West
must leav he stated, “that not ev-
erytlling it has is particularly bcuua
titul. A certain amount or it is mean
and ugly, and should not be adopted
by the East.

"Second, the West must learn to
change its attitude oi exploitation.
Fcrhaps it must give up the Colonies .

its markets only by the merit at its
goods.

“Third, the West must revise its
unilateral trcatics, and abolish extras.
territoriality. Agrecmcnts should be
on tho basis ol equalit'"

"A new religions approach, based on
sympathy, is badly nocdct Dr, Fish—
(l' said. "We must learn to undcn
