The New Gymnasium.
(Contililltzd lroni First Page)

There will be two stairivays in
the htlildlng. one of which can be
used by visitors while the other
will be for those working in the
gymnasium.

The grove on the north or the
campus has been chosen as the lo-
cation of the gymnasium lor che
eral reasons. The building is not
such aone as should demand a
piomiiientposition on the campus.
and its location midway between
Ward Field and the college build»
ings will make it most convenient
ly situated both to the athletes
and to the students who go to it
trorn the other buildings.

Work upon the gymnasium will
be pushed rapidly. btit it is doubt-
Iul whether more Carl be done be-
fore wtnter. than the laying ofthe
foundation. lt there is an early
spring it is probable that the build-
ing will be entirely completed be-
fore the close of the school year

To»day’s Football Games.

The outcome of to-day's toot-
ball games both among eastern
and weslcrn teams will be noted
With great interest. Probably the
gamcivhicli is of most interest is
the Chicago-Pennsylvania contest.
which is being played this after
noon in Philadelphia, Pennsyl-
vania expects to win. but they ad-
mit that Chicago is liable to score
through the agency of Herchbcrg
er's kicking. Both tcams are in
good condition. and it is generally
admitted that the Quakers will
have to play good ball to defeat
the ticstcrncrs.

Yale left yesterday with forty
men for West Point, where they
playthesoltliereleven. ThCNew
Haven team are in a badly erlp.
pled condition and twenty men
may be required to complete the

 

game. Princetonarld Bioivn line
up at Providence to-day, The
Princeton squad is in excellent
condition with one or two excep-
tions. Palmer will play All lelt.
end in today's game, Harvard
and the Catlisle Indians rlo battle
on the gridiron at Cambridge to
day. Harvard has been playing
good ball this year. and has been
taitunate enough to have btit few
men crippled. The Indians. how
ever. played a strong game against
Yale. and they will probably play
a strong game today.

Ofthc western games the one
at Madison where the crippled
teams of Minnesota and Wiscon
sin line up, will be watched with
great interest. Captain Cole. of
the Gophers and Captain 0 Dea.
of thc Badgers will both be llnr
able to play. so that neither team
will be capable of putting up its
best game.

5. U. I. sent a badly crippled
team to meet Rush Medical at
Rock Island to- day. \Viwht the
university's center rush has left
Iowa City and entered Drak<.
while A. Blackniorc is laid up
with a badly wrenched ankle and
R. Blackmorc reltises to play.

Innes’ Band Concert.

Gritiiiell isespecially favored in
being ableto hear thc Innes Band,
which will give a concert in the
Congregational church next Tues
day evening. This band is proba
bly the ﬁnest in the country. giv~
ing its whole timetoconccrt work

and playing nothing but a high '

grade ot music. For the past six
weeks they have been playing at
the Omaha exposition where they
have met with thegreatcst success,
being considered as one or the
chief attractions of the Exposir
tion. On their way east this is the
only stop they make between Qm-
aha and Chicago. while between
Chicago and New York they will
give only three or four concerts.
The chance or hearingthe band is
one which no lover of music can
afford to miss.
