. About a Tradition.

As the (lay of judgment relentlessly sneaks
up, there is frantic activity in the cottages
and dorms. “Everybody out for sing p ace
tice!" What are psych tests, zoo qui ,es, and
other exigencies of the morrow compared to
the glory of dear old Clark, or Hailies, or
Mearsl Forgotten are minor jealousies and
animosities while all voices and souls blend

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

(a little flat on that E) in lvouldvbe Orphean
melody.

The pielimindiy judging tomorrow will
malk the climax in a newly established Grin—
nell tradition, the all college sing Inaugur’
ated last year by the Crescendo club, itself
a pioneer on the campus, for the purpose of
encouraging student particidption in and ap-
preciation of singing, the,“singfest” was
or glnally limited to the cottages in the
women’s Quadrangle. This year, however,
with the presentation of the John C. Fet-
zer and Dorothy S. Fetzer trophies, the
men’s dorms will also he represented, and
competition has grown sharper and more
intensified.

The immediate significance of the slug
contest for those participating above the
intro-cottage and dorm fellowship and the
competition with other halls which it nat-
urally encourages, is an increased percep-
tion of the many elements that make up
the apparently simple act of singing, Sc-
lections of songs, arrangement into appr s
priatc ports, direction, blending of voices,
timing, coordination, volume control, enun-
ciation, and stage effect are some of the
problems which must be faced. Even the
the llumblest back row squealier has his
ear trained to the music to appraise the
total effect and offer pertinent suggestions
for the elimination of minor faults.

In a college like Grinnell where the eme
pllasis has alltays been “learn by doing,“

the all»college sing seems destined to her
come zln indispensable tradition.

To llic editor:

We understand that this is not
the first time that the name of
“Hell Week” has been temporarily
abandoned in favor of a less fcar-
ful title, From personal exper-
iencc, cii lictli ends of some
similar situations, we feel that
spring “Hell Week” is a uses
less function, We do, however,
fully agree min the fall pi-cp inl-
pi-ovsinent period, At this time
of the ycci, most of the fresh-
men should be taught how they
are supposed to conduct them-
selves.

With such a brief and such a
full period between spring and
summer Vacations, we think that
the spring improvement mover
mcnt is more harmful than help»
ful. Mind you, wc are not arguing
for ourselves this year, but for
those who are to come in the
future when we ourselves are in
the drivel": scat. Spring, in fact
nearly summer, is not a vcry
appropriate time to try to im-
prove the preps. if they aren't
improved by now, they never will
be,

Thus, we feel that the idea of
changing the name but kccping
the principles is a wrong one,
and that it would best be cured
by future abolishment of spring
“Hell Week.” We also knew that
We arC backed in this feeling by
many Gi-innellicns, including
pi-cps, upperclassmcn, and faculty.

To the editor:
This is not any specific complaint
and is directed toward no spccific
person, but the relation of Gun
ncll students and faculty is con-
tinllally hampered by “red tape.”

There are few. practically no
matters. that can be transacted
directed and quickly.

This tendency to quibble over
ti‘ifles, to lose sight of the large
because of tlic small, is not a
life or death matter, but it is one
that does interfere with the best
interests of Grinnell college.

2 Dog Addition

By Estlicr chi-lean,
There was a happy day when a
dog could call his soul his own,
when honcs were made to bury.
and only kids under 16 had to go
to school.

But for two small black cooker
spunicls, recently adopted by
Gates Kennels, life is Just one
long book to chew.

Too young to wander on the
paths of higher learning, the
seven-weeks old pups spend their
days yapping up and down the
hallowed halls of Gates, tripping
over their own curs Called “Dams

brothers, their given names are B,
