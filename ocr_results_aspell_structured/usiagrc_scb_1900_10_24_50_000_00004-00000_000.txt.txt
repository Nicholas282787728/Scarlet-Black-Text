Chrestomathlant

Last Saturday's meeting was up
to the usual standard, The pro-
gram was opened with a piano
solo by Miss Burns, who respond-
cd to a hearty encore, Heald
delivered an oration on the poet
Byron. andjenes gave a tour mine
ute address on the subject of
examinations. Tile next number
on the program, Pantomine Dual
Meet between S. U. I. and Grim
neli, was somewhat unique in so-
ciety work, and was fully as enter-
taining and amusing as it was
unique, The meet was progress-
ing favorably and some excellent
records were being made, when it
began to rain, apparently, and
the meet was declared off. Some
of the best extemporaileous work
of the year was done by Wharton,
Crabb, and Risser, The debate
oi the evening was then taken up.
The ‘question was, “Resolved that
the unanimous verdict ot the jury
should remain a permanent feat-
urc at the jury system." Parker
supported the ainrmative and
Benson the negative. Benson
had a good, well arranged argu-
ment and the decision of the chair
was given to the negative.

Typhold at Amos.

Word was received this morn-
ing from Amos that they are
compelled to cancel the game
with Iowa which was to be played
at Ames tomorrow afternoon. A
large number of Ames students
including several ofthe players
on the team are sick with typhoid
fever. It is to be regretted that
Antes and Iowa cannot meet this
year, but Iowa colleges fully ap-
preciate the serious condition of
the State college, Ames has the
sympathy ot Iowa in her trouble
and all Iowa hopes that none of
the cases may result fatally,—
