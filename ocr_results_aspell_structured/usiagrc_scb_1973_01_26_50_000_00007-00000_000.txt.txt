Jack Collum of the Pioneer Oil
Company is a former maior lea-
gue baseball hurler whose ballplay—
ing profession has carried him from
Vancouver to Venezuela Along his
iourneys, he witnessed a young rad-
ical named Fidel Castro emerge
from the stands in Havana and de—
mind to pitch a few balls in the
middle of a contest, He has, in his
own right, pitched a doubleheader
while a Grinnell high school youth,
He pitched one game as a south—
paw and the other from his star
board side, Like so many other na»
tive Grinnellians, he has returned
to his home town, enriched by a
wealth of fascinating experiences.

The St. Louis Cardinals signed C017
lum upon hearing or his exploits
in Tokyo with an Armed Forces ball-
club. In 1948, he fashioned a 2672
ledger as a pitcher while batting
.388 as a part-time outfielder at
St, Joseph in Class C ball. Although
this performance led to a spring
training tryout, he was unable to
crack the Cardinals' roster as they
had five well established lefthandr
ers. Instead, he was forced to set-
tle for a $25 raise and a ticket
to Omaha in the minor leagues.

When Jack arrived in the majors
in 1951, he made a big splash. In
his first game, he shut out the Cubs
on two hits. In his second outing,
also against the Cubs. he pitched
seven scoreless innings, Manager
Marty Marion then requested Jack
to pitch the last two innings right—
handed. Jack declined but continued
and won the game Although he pose
sessed equal coordination on both
sides, Jack explains that he was
more proficient from the left side
because it was stronger and al-
ways in condition.

ISPIRG STUDY

. Utility Deposit Refunds

by Curt Gorrell

The student who moves into an
apartment for the first time learns
that in order to get electricity
and a telephone, he or she must
urten iirst pay up to a $100 deposit
for such service But what Stu»
dents aren’t often told is that they
retain a claim on this money.
Harry Derderian, an ISPIRG local
board member at Grinnell, today
reported that students are entitled
to a refund with interest on any
telephone or utility deposit paid,
Derderiah's announcement is based
on the findings of a study of utilr
ity and telephone deposits conducted
by ISPIRG (Iowa Student Public ln-
terest Research Group).
Regulations set by the Iowa Con-1
merce Commission allow each uti
ity company to require a deposit
intended to guarantee payment of
bills for service from any cus-
tomer. lsleG's study shows acor-
come level and deposit charges.
such that the poorer a person is,
the greater the likelihood that a de,
posit will be required.

style, Collum Jokes, “1 used towalk

with the Dodgers, the great Roy
Campanella sultered his paralyzing
car accident. Jack believes that
Campy would have added toiiror live
years to his career due to his unis
que catching savvy, had he not been
injured

A highlight oi his career was his
selection to the AllrSiar game in
1956, 1n lact, during that year, he
captured the runnerup position to
Robin Roberts for the E R A tit-
le. Even this was superceded by the
time when a self-prophesied homer
off his bat won a case of beer for
diminutive Jack as the prize of a
bet with teammate Gus Bell. Lal-
er, the Grinnell iarm boy roonied
with a promising and shy Dodger
leithander by the name of Sandy

While playing baseball in Cuba,
he fell in love with the island, Cole
lum sounds like an economics pron
lessor when he explains that Ba-
tista ”did more for that country
than anyone ever did.” When Case
tro assumed command, us. money
which provided for a majority oi
the economy, disappeared. On Col—
lum's last trip to the island in 1953,
the players were housed in a come
pound encircled by barbed Wire.
A Cuban player was shot tor po-
litical involvmeht and Castro fl‘e»
oueutly created a scene at the ball-
park.

After the 1362 season Jack retired
with the security ofbaseball's “fab—
ulous pension plan. Baseball was
good to me...its an honest game,”
he reflects He was tired of tra-
velling, spending half of his time
away from his lamily. Jack and his
wife have a family of six children.
His son, Tom, helps his dad at
the Pioneer station and is content
to play summer, seniirpro base-

“1 don’t think that it's lair, but
it's legal,” commented Derderian.
“Our research shows that court
decisions in other states have up-
held and approved the practice oi
utility deposits on the theory that
deposits were reasonably related
to the reduction of baddebtlosses,”
“However,” Derderian added, “I
think that it‘s important for students
to know that people who pay depos-
its for utiltities and phones can get
a refund alter twelve consecutive
months of prompt payments. Also,
simple interest ol 5% must be paid
when the deposit is refunded."
Derderian also advised students
who were dissatisfied with the an
mount of a deposit assessed to them
to file a complaint with the Iowa
Commerce Commission at the Val~
ley Bank Building in Des Moines,

pies had made a paper mache rat
looking amazmgly like President
Nixon

However, their parade permit only
called for marchers, lloats were
not included The police reportedly
told the marchers to get the rat off
the street and onto the sidewalk.
One policeman shouted, “Curb that
Goddamn rat‘”

Since the rat would not [it on the
sidewalk, the government moved in
to take it away A tug oiwarstarted,
with the police on one side oi the
rat and the Yipples and Zippies
on the other. Finally, the police
pulled the rat away from the itipe
pies and removed it, The Yippies
reportedly wanted to get the rat
along the inauguration parade route,
so that president Nixon could see
it.

Later in the day, as the SDS coh-
tingent moved toward the main mars
ch, they clashed with the police
again, As the contingent passed the
Washington Monument, they re—
moved flags irom the poles, ran
them back upside down. and iinally
burned them, along with snow fenc~
ing The police moved in and made
several arrests.

The largest event, The March A»
gainst Death, was led by 2000 peo»
ple wearing black shrouds and white
makeup Former Grinnelllan Ted
Glick was a principle organizer oi
this part of the march. These“sym-
bols of death" were cards bearing
the names oi people killed in the
war, both American and Vietnam,
ese, cities hit by US. bombs, and
major battles in the Vietnam war.
A {load or people lollowed, iilling
Constitution Avenue for hours.

In the middle 01 the rally (after
about 5 speakers) approximately 50,
000 people moved over the Pres-
ident’s inauguration parade which
was still in progress. This large
number oi people. still protesting
the war, may have contributed to
the ridiculous count of over 300,
000 attending the inauguration cere
emonies, made by the 11.3 Park
police.

other events held over the week-
end included 2 all night vigils held
Friday and Saturday nights, a Dene»

Vietnamese hospital destroyed dur—
ing the December bombing raids,

in which Eugene McCarthy gave a
major address, and a “standln”
in front at the US capitol held
by the vippies and Zippies.
