T.» LUIZS OF THE GATES LECTURES

Now that another series of Gates Memorial lectures
has just been delivered, comes the natural query: Does
this series of lectures each year have any permanent
values? The answer to such a question is strongly in
the affirmative. The uniformly high calibre of those who
have talked here each year has tended to establish a
set of values for the series as much, to which each
speaker has made his own contribution, as Dr. Rufus
Jones has nhiy done this ycar.

In general, the Gates lectures have tour outstanding
features: they present outstanding personalities in the
field of religious thought, they bring the ideas of world
leaders to Grinnell students through these men, they
leave each year a dominant idea, and finally, they are an
indication of the student's interest in religion.

In the years since 1313, when the Gates Foundation
was established, Grinnell faculty and students have con-
sisteutly been privileged to listen to a group of men who
occupy the most prominent positions in the field of re—

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

liglori, who do so because they have dared to suggest
that Christianity, reinterpreted and more human, can be
applied to the complexity or social and economic rclft»
[ions of the modern world.

Lock, ior example, at the roll of the past iew lcc-
turers. Professor shailer Mathews, or Chicago univcrr
sity, the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdiclr, Bishop Francis
J. McConnell, the Rev, Charles W. Gilkey, and Doctor
Jones, who has just concluded a series or addresses on
“The Quest for God”—-these are men whose names are
prominent wherever modern trends in religion are meria
ticnod today.

Through these men, Grinnoll students have been
made 10 tool an intimate terms with world leaders, for
Professor Jones is but a typical example or the Gates
lecturers of the past~widcly travelled, widely expcr-
ienced, and he like other (kites lecturers brought into his
addresses the ideas and ideals of men of international
fame,

The permanent impression lclt on student thought
by the lecturers is harder to diagnose. Each speaker has
used different pliruseology, yet most of them have said
this in substance: As the world has reached out more
and more for material gold, it has shown the need for
religious and ethical standards not to .1 loss, but to a
greater degree: real genius can not develop out of mere
mater' lisiii, but only from a life of rich experience. 1n
a word, they have pinned their faith to modern Chris-
tianity as a greater force than materialism, Sonic would
debate such an assertion, but its continued presentation
has constituted one or the real values of the lectures,

Finally, those who view the empty church pews to-
day with great concern tor religion in the future should
go to Herrick chapel at the hour oi the Gates lectures
each day and see there at, least partly vindicated the deep
interest or youth in religion, us apart from the creed
and dogma or its forefathers.

Because the Gates lecturers oi the past, and Doctor
Jones this year carried on the tradition, have done these
things, the series remains deservedly popular catch year
and an integral part of Grinncil college life.

“BEST SELLERS” FOR STUDENTS

\Vitli the establishment of a rental-collection of the
type today in the SCARLET AND BLACK, the most
recent, popular and best books, both of the fiction and
non»lictluu class, will at last be available to the student
body. Not only is the plan we“ worked out, but it ful-
fills a longstanding need, which it has seemed impossible
in the past to meet because of restricted funds available
for the purchase of new books of general interest.

The new feature is one to be commended. The de-
mand for the few books of general reader interest that
the library has been able to make available to the stu-
dents is always far in excess of the supply. Anywhere
from ten to thirty people are often on the waiting list
for a new book. A person who signs in October may see
little but the cover of the much-desired book for two
months or more.

This regrettable situation should be satisfactorily
settled by the new idea which goes into operation at once.
it will undoubtedly widen the circle of those who like a
really good book; best of all, it can be expanded to in-
clude more books as rapidly as the students desire, for
upon their response to the new plan will depend its
financial success, which in turn will determine the num-
ber of books which can he purchased in the future.

the infinite, but in which the two tend
to interpenetrate. These mystical ex-
periences are more or less states of
concentration such as one has when
enjoying music, beauty, or great
love. There is complete absence of
the concibosness of the cell; can-
sciousness of Divine presence re-
mains, or a feeling of a new order of
environment in which the person is
at home.

The great question concerning mys-
ticism is whether the experience is
merely emotional outlet, or results in
a broadening of thought and exper-
ience which generates a new capacity
tor and a more dynamic initiative. Dr. \Vashington, 34.
Jones, of course, holds the latter Wientge, f.

In closing Dr. Jones said, “I am
