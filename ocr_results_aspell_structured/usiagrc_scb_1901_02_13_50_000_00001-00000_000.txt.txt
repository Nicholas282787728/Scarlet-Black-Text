REQUIREMENTS mt Al MISSION TO
IOWA CoLL

Many letters and intpiiries are received.
asking ior a statement oi the rCltliI'es
nients ior admission to low-a Co legs,

and risking ior aireaplnrratierioitlrc (tile
,iererrces, where any t. between them
and those adopted by other colleges in
the state. it is hoped that the loliowr
iiig statements will help to make the mat
ter clca
opositiou on which the require
rnrrtts here are brrsetlis that all courses in
in college oi this type should trim at ilb»
oral culture in the best anti highest sense,
and that to secure this end the rctittire
merits ior admission to all groups or-
COHISCS Should be essentially the same.
A SClethl: course. [or example, tltat
eliminate ilirige poriimroitlrelrrngitaee
requirement and pcrmrts a substitution
at other suhiects. howerer good they
in: be iit themselves, loses thereby
something on me liberal side and takes
on in a proportional degree a technical
‘cliamcicr. Topreventtlris,thelangtrage
rctpr ernents ior-titlrnis on to the sclenr
titic groupsoistiidy are exactly the same
in hunt and amount as those ior the litr
erary groups. Tit-o foreign languages
ior admission are rctprircd oi all. These
languages may be Latin and Greek; or
,Latrn and Ge nan; or Latinand Flench.
litany high schools are not yet able to
provide a course with two loreigir iall»
giragcs. To meet this dimcult trrdeirts
are admitted to Freshman c/rti, ﬂzlllwli
who are tlehcient in the second language,
2‘"an tt-n-M- .,
Nosubstrttitiorir accepted tin-
tler any circumstances ior the language
There is simply the option, as indicated
above, between a second ancient 1mi-
giinge and a modern language.

ilairy ol the colleges in this state and
atliointng ones admit students to sciclts
titic courses with one language, either
ancient or modern. in sonre cases the
retutiiemerrt is not more than two years
oi language as compared with the irvc or
sly years ietpni-ed tor the literary courses.
This tends greatly to handicap the liter.
ary courses in these same colleges autl
tends to reduce the number seeking adr
mission to colleges making the same re-
tririrement lot-all courses. Many students
having taken English courses in high
schools, or ironr schools not prepared to
do ii/sallsftlctoiy amount oi language
work, are irrtltierrccd to take scientiﬁc
courses when their natural aptitude is
along literary lines, doing so lor the sake
oi the “advantage" secured in being ads
mittetl as lreslrmen without condition.
The Size oi the ircslrman class in lowa
College has steadily increased under the
ct ting requirementsattd there is not
likely to be any modiﬁcation oi them
suggested.

in matiy colleges oi this state there are
scientiﬁc and special courses ha ing, as
stated, rerprirerneiits ior adnri ion that
arccsserrtially dilierent iiom those re,
truiretl oi candidates tor the classical aotl
litera , , courses. For these scientiﬁc and
special courses the retiuircirrents ia fore
eigrr language may he sati ted by two
years oi air ient ltrrrguagc, or by two
years ol German, or by two years oi
French. For the language thus elimi.
nated. substitutions oi science, history,
English, and other subjects, are accepted
isuhjccls taught in suirrcietrt amount iii
no rly all high schools.

i ‘Ihc sake oi comparison it maybe
stated that the tccitiiienrents iorarlniis.
sion to the Yale College oi Liberal Arts,
as reportcd in the current catalogue,
are csscnually the same in ancient lan-
gtiages as those ior ioitir College. This is
alsotrrrc ior i\. lierrratics anti English.
in addition to these subjects one modern
language is required, French or German.
The etamiiration in this language is
adapted to the proﬁciency oi those who
haye studied a systematic course oi lire
hours a week for tins VCEH. Thcrcmc no
other rctttiiicincnts ior admi ion except
Grech and Roman I-listo y. There is no
science requirement.
