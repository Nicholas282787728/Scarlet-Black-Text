VICE'PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

Brentnall promises attention to
curriculum and JUDCO issues

Hello. My name is John Brentnall
and I am a candidate for the position
of SGA VicePresident. I am a junior,
majoring in Political Science. My
campus involvement includes mem-
bership on the political science Stu-
dent Education Policy Committee
(SEPC), Hall Activities Coordinator
for Smith hall, and particir
pant on the men‘s varsity
tennis team,

The VicerPresident/

President of Academic Af-
fairs’ tasks can be divided
into two distinct areas: cur-
riculum and initiating the
student judicial process.
Being open to the opinions
of the student body and
showing responsibility in
communicating that mes-
sage to the Grinnell College
administration are the most
important functions the VP
must fulfill.

One of the most common
complaints heard on this
campus concerning curricu»
lum is the size of classes.

Seniors in some departments often
find themselves enrolled in seminars
with 15 or more students, Spending
extramoney for new professors is not
realistic dining a time of budget con-
straints, so I propose that a departe
ment by department study be con»
ducted by each of the SEPC‘s. Some

in the elections (if even
that). or a brief talk with
your senator on a certain
topic that is of concern to
you.Thoseofyouwhohave
workedwithSGA,beitover
a sports club budget, in
planning an all campus
event, orjust voicing your
view over a topic of con-
cern, know the importance
of good leadership to fairly
and effectively represent
your views.
Apathyisnotawordthat
can be used to describe this
campus. If those within
SGA are not aware of the
' many pointsofview on this
. campus, they aren‘t lookr
. ing very hard, The roles of
President and Vice-President take on
a much broader role than the formal

of the data collected could include:
how many majors are in each class
(and total of majors), how many proe
fessors are in each department, how
many classes are offered (on aver»
age), how many classes close. how
large classes designed fore seniors
are, etc Such a comprehensive study

will reveal which departments are
most in need of new resources and
how we could reallocate resources
into these departments

As the initiator of the .IUDCO pro
cess, it is extremely imponant to en-
sure that the studentjudicial process
remains a fair and vital partofstudent

life. JUDCO is the student’s voice

concerning what disciplinary actions

should be taken on students; this in

t‘luential voice that the students have

with the administration should be

maintained and strengthened if pos-

fans. I have demonstrated

this through the campus ac-

tivities with which I am inv

volvcd. The political science

SEPC usually meets weekly

and discusses curriculum

questions and problems

within our department. This

experience will help me

greatly . The HAC position

can befnrstrating ifaHAC is

not willing to go out of his/

her way to provide

dormmates with a variety of

activities; I have committed

who has participated in ath-

must be made in order to maximize

individual and team performance. If

duties witli the same enthusiasm and
