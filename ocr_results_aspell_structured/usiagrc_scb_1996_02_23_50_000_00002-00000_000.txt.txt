reading, and a series of films and
lectures. Rita Rawson, a Grinnell
graduate who now works in the ca.

fairs offices. says that planning the
events for Black History Month take
much time and effort on the part of
black students.

these eventsshouldnotbe complete—
ly in their hands. Also the issue of
setting aside just twenty—eight days
in a year to examine the history of a
people is of concern to Rawson. She
emphasizes that giVing one month
to celebrate African—American his—
tory degrades its importance, Raw—
sonsays that Black History should be
an important element oftl'ie Amer-
ican experience at all times ifit is to
be truly recognized, Rawson and

Iowa House passes several legislative bills

The Iowa House of Representatives passed seveml bills this past week.
The house passedabillwhich requires sex offender registrychecks for foster
care, child day care, adoption agencies, and other such institutions. A
slightly more controversial bill also passed on Wednesday which would
make any conscious assistance of a suicide attempt a Class C felony,
punishable by 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Earlier in the week the Iowa House approved a bill which states that
Iowa will not recognize any marriage which does not conform to Iowa’s
marriage laws, The bill, which passed on Tuesday, strongly affects same—
sex couples and would not pertriit same—sex marriages in Iowa, even if those
marriages were to bepermitted elsewhere. Gov. Terry Branstad has already
voiced support for the anti—gay legislation, according to the Des Moines
Register.

Utah school board takes strong anti-gay stand

State senators in Utah threatened that, if necessary, they were
prepared to ban all high—school clubs in order to prevent the Gay/Straight
Alliance from meeting in a Salt Lake City Utah high school, The
statements were made after a controversial decision in Salt Lake on
Tuesday. The Salt Lake City Board of Education voted to terminate not
only the Gay/StraightAlliance, butalso the ski, chess, beef, Latino, Frisbee
and Bible clubs. Some senators and supporters of the school board‘s
decision justify the action by claiming both a moral obligation and legal
authority to keep gay clubs out of public schools.

Massachusetts researchers find marijuana impairs
cognition, U ofI researcher questions implications

Frequent marijuana use may decrease ability to maintain or shift
attentionI according to two Massachusetts researchers. Sixty—five college
students identified as heavy marijuana users were compared to sixty—four
light users who had no traces of marijuana in their system. The heavy users
displayed poorerattention and performance on tasks such ascard sortingand
word learning, according the study. However, questions remain as to the
cause of brain impairment. Unlvetstty of Iowa’s Robert I Block, while
stating that the results are important, adds that caution should be taken
when interpreting the study. Block added that surprisingly few studies have
been conducted which attempt to show a direct link between drug use and
subsequent brain damage.
