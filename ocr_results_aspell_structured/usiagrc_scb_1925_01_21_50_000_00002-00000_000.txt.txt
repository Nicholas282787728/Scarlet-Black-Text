THE lKIiIVlDUALIST AND SOCIETY
in recent years a group ot sells
opinionated “intellectuals" has grown
up. who accuse our institutions of
higher leaining, Grinnell included; of
stunting initiative, dwarfing individ-
.nalism, and turning out a "type" of
student, very much as ii sausage grinds
er thi-ns out sausage, They appear to
think that majority action is always
sheep-like, without individual thought,
while expression of one's inner self
can be made only in a bolting from the
ideas and ideals o[ the major
Because most students fratei-nize
freely, participate in largely the some
activities. and appear, to a greater or
less extent, to have similar tastes, t‘ens
dcncics, and standards, they are immer
diately catalogued by the radicals as a
“type", which by mcre deﬁnition robs
them of intelligent initiative and tho
apt to think and act independently

not all she is cracked up to be.

I was interested in his statement
that we are supposed to he a school
where one may "he himself" without
feeling that the whole student body
is talking behind his bank. His states

be a school where individualism is
prized. In the lingo of the moderns
