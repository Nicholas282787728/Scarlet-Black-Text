The trail Continued to climb, sometimes
leveling out. sometimes winding perpenr
dicular to the slope in a series of Swit-

Susan ignored l‘llm, Her face was stone.

couldn't accept that! She had to know [or

The three riders had left the trail and
were traversing the jagged backbone or a
rocky ridge The clouds had enveloped the
sky-ripping peaks and the broken. jutting
ridges The sun was bright and burning.
The clouds eddied about the horses and
riders as a mist of searing whiteness. The
jingling of the horses‘ bits was muffled

The pinched lines in the guides tanned
forehead became deeper Manuel smiled
nervously as he turned in his saddle. The
crew's feet at the edges of his eyes had
become more deﬁned. “Senorita. " he
rasped in broken English “Dees ees not
good. We mus‘ to turn back."

Susan shook her head She was not going
to come this tar just to give in on account
of this man‘s nervousness about the
weather, Why. Manuel had no idea how

much she had gone through in her search

“Susan!" Dave's voice snapped her
back. “This is insanity!" The clouds were
closing in rapidly now. The sun‘s rays
seemed to reiieci oii oi each individual
shining particle. Visibility was worse, Up
ahead. Manuel was only a blurredshape. a
gray rider surrounded by blinding
whiteness.

Manuel had turned back around in his
saddle. He was barely audible and had
lapsed into Spanish. “Malo, es muy
malo..,no es natural lie continued his
muttered ramblings,

Dave's horse centered up next to
Susan's He looked over at her. She fixed

reins back violently. She drove her heels

body-wrenching blow as she hit the stony

Susan looked down into the unbroken

The pain had grown worse, With every

The sling she iinally iashioned irom her

feat. Susan had nearly passed out in the
process.

The trees were becoming more
numerous now. and greenery was spring-

was thriving in places where it wouldn't
grow on higher ground. Susan's thirst had

View from the Outside

by Paul Draus

Once in a \vhile l go to the weight room I
don't know why.

I never lifted weights before, at least not
on a consistent basis i remember in high
school the weight room vias always a
mysterious place {or me. it was located in
an isolated area of the third lloor. and
whenever lwalked by I would hear grunts
and sounds oi metal clanglng against
metal revel-berating down the stairwell
Until my sophomore year. i thought there
was a blacksmith shop up there. i swear

When I Went out for track as a
sophomore. they took us up there for what
they called “weight training." I had no
idea Why runners should have to lift
weights. but the coaches were stuck on the
idea. Anyway. when l iii-st saw- the weight
room. I thought it looked like some sort of
medieval torture chamber, wilh all those
straps and benches and hulking barbells.
It was a bleak room that always smelled
like rusting iron, and the bright paints
which had been splashed 0n the walls in
some lastvdilch attempt to make the place
look inviting really didn't help at all. I
hated it I would gel out as quickly as I
could. going through the motions cl lifting
something. waiting until the coach wasn't
looking and the narrow stairway was open.
and then slipping quietly away

01’ course. there were always guys that
spent every tree moment in the weight
room. By senior year. these guys would be
impressing people with their bulging
biceps and rippling pectoral muscles. and
I would look at them and wonder, “Gee,
what happened to him? He used to be the
same size as me,"

But that‘was high school Now that I‘m
in college. and lack of exercise and the
multiple hearty entrees available at every
meal are making it that much harder to
keep off the extra pounds, my outlook on

the whole physical illness thing has com~
pleteiy changed. I. like millions ot other
Americans. have become obsessed wilh
developing my body.

of course. some of us are less obsessed
than others i happen to be one or those
whose obsession comes in spurts. Once
every couple oi days. weeks. or months. i
will get an irresistible urge lo deceive
myself into thinking I'm healthy. and I will
head on down to the old physical education
complex to hone my musculature. it nor-
mally doesn't take me very long, because I
really don't have much musculature to
hone. and i usually end up ileeing the
weight room within a half an hour.

l guess, even today. there's something
about those places that just scares me. I
don‘t know what it is. but every time I go in
there. I feel intimidated For one thing. I
really have no idea what the hell I‘m dos
ing. ['1] walk around. touching this or that
piece or equipment. lilting whatever there
is that I'm capable oi iiiting The thing IS.
there usually aren‘t that many things that

l'm capable of lifting. Whoever uses that ‘

stull helore i get there always piles on as
much weight as he can manage and then
leaves it that way. So here i am. standing
in front of a sinhundredrpDund barbell.
scratching my chin and asking myseii.
"Was Schwarzenegger here again?" And
you can't help lecling stupid, walking up to

men. intent on his daily regimen. and in»
quiring. 'Excuse me. where are the little
weights ‘ .

And then. whend finally find something
that 1 can and want to belt a law times, I
can't escape the reeling that everyone in
the room IS watching me. This ieeiing is
magnilied about twenty times by the
presence, oi the i‘loorvto-ceilmg mirrors
which l'm sure have some practical pur-
pose bestdes allowing people to admire

themselves. There‘s nothing wrong with
that. I suppose. but every timine i take a
glance iii the mirror to admire my own
not-quilcrlean. taut physique. I get the lmr
pression that everyone else in the room is
watching me look at myself alid saying to
eacli’other. "Look at that guy! He keeps
