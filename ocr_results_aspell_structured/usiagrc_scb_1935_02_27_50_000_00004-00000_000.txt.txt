OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 27~(Special)7
Creighton university can win one oi
the most exciting Missouri Valley con.
ference cage races in history with vic.
tories over Washhurn and Tulsa uni.
versity here Wednesday and Friday
nights, respectively. Wins in the two
games remaining on the schedule would
give the Bluejays undisputed possession
of the loop title.

Everything that "had to happen it
happened in the. Valley race last week.
Washington handed Grinnell a 50.44
pasting in an overtime game to elim.
inate them from titular consideration.
But that leit Drake with a chance at
the trophy. The Oklahoma Aggies took
care of that problem by dumping the
Bulldogs, 29 to 26, to leave Creighton
at Lhe top of the heap. Grinnell is in
second place and Drake in third.

“Up to the Jays”

Now it is up to the Bluejays. Coach
Schabinger’s cohorts have victories over
both Washhurn and Tulsa in early sea.
son games, The Ichabods were down.
ed 32 to 28. at Topeka and the Golden
Hurricane dropped a as to 22 decision.
But both teams have come along dur.
ing the season and are doped to give
Creighton plenty of trouble.

The Bluejays had a d'ehresslng time
during the past week. They journeyed
to Nashville. Tenn, whipped a
good Vanderbilt university team by a
lopsided 53 to 28 score and then loop.
ed over to Lexington. Ky, an dropped
two in a row to Kentucky university,
There they were the victims of one of
the greatest personal scoring sprees in
southern basketball history in the lirst
game.

One Man Team

Leroy Edwards, tall Wildcat center.
dropped in 15 goals and four free
tosses for 34 points to enable his team
to win, 6342. The fact that Emil “on”
Engelbrelson, brilliant Creighton for.
ward, was garnering 22 points on nine
goals and (our free thmws didn’t keep
the Bluejays in the running.

0n the iollowing night the two teams
staged a precise reversal of scoring
tactics and the best Kentucky could
get was 24 while Cr'elghtcn was even
worse with 13 points. it was a deien.
sive game, pure and simple, with both
teams over cautious. Creighton led
at the half.time, 9 to a, and increased

 

that lead to 11 to a at the beginning or
the second halt, but alter that Ken.
lucky iorged ahead to victory.
