Despite this loss, Harvey said that he
still plans to pick up the offensive pace and
be less methodical in bringing the ball up
court.

To this end he has added freshmen Den»

Mark Cloud, who did not play on the inter—
varisty team prior to this, his sophomore.

the core of guards. In a scrimmage against
Des Maines Area Community Couege last
Tuesday night, Blyly’s quick hands ac-
counted for numerous turnovers that
resulted in Pioneer pointsi s

The {act that there are no seniors and on»
1y three juniors on the squad has not, ac-
cording to Harvey, left the team in a bad
position as far as team leadership is con-
cemed. “I haven't really noticed a need
for a team leader at this point,” said
harvey. He said that the role of team cap-
tain would not automatically go to one of
the juniors because, with over half of the
team being sophomores, he could not
guarantee that one of the juniors would
even start,

while most or the top teams in the league
last year should remain tough, Harvey
pointed out that Grinnell should improve
more than the others because all but four
members of this year’s squad played
together last. year and don't have to learn a
new system.

The women’s team, unlike the men’s,
lost several players from last year’s team,

' including Paula Moon. In addition to the

. first-year coach, Cathie Schweitzer, since

Merry Orrnsby also lett last yarr

Schweitzer Said that her squad. which
has been practicing since November 2 and
has their lirst game tomorrow at lndian
Hills, is “starting to click,” She has
revamped the oftense to include more
passing and a fast break attackr She did
allow that it may take a while for her
players to get used to the new program, '

Senior Julie Crawford, a key performer
for the squad last year, is expected to pro-
vide leadership for the team, on the floor
this year. She is the only senior on this
otherwise quite young team.

Schweitzer is also looking to sophomores
Heidi Galster, Val Mauck, Regina
McMenamin and first-year player Lyn-
nette Ickes to be prime contributors to the
team. Freshman Audrey Crawford and
junior Lisa lngenito, it she can stay
healthy, are others that Should help out.

face this season is expected to remain
tough but Schweitzer's goal for this season
is to finish with a .500 mark.
