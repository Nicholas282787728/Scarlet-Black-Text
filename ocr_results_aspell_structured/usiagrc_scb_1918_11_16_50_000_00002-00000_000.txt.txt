SATI‘RDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1918: l

.______._—-——

OUR AWAKENING.

The greatest day in the world’s
great history is November 11, 1918.
That day has gone on, now. like any
other, and our emotions have quieted
down a bit. Yet we shall never torget
the impressions, the thoughts. the
sfi‘unge, visions, all the wonder or it
which so completely dazed our senses
tor the time. -

We heard peace bells and joyful,
wees; we read facts; we tried to an.
elyze it all, to set it in order. to col-
lect our lost thoughts; and always we

' came back to the fact that it was all
tpo big ior us to comprehend.

We always felt that when the war
ended everything would be settled.

lived so intensely in the present,
om one day to the next, that the
thot of a future had never occurred
to us. And then came the blinding res
alization or peace, and not the end, but
the beginning, of everything. The past
was cut off, the present was unreal. So
there we were, facing a great puzzle.
ﬂamethihg we did not even hope to
solve.

But now we have awakened some-
what mid to our surprise, problems
are beginning to take definite torms.
we can see that there is going to he a
roture aiter all and that plans far that
tuturc are already under way.

What part we are to have in that
makingeovor of the world that must
come within our own lives we do not
know as yet. The deﬁnite steps to be
taken are thus iar unplanned. But
whatever the days shall bring iorth we
are determined to meet and when once
our duty‘ becomes clear we shall direct
our every etiort toward accomplishing
it. ' —The Carletonia.

PATRIOTIC SPORTSBLANSHIP. ,

VWlicrever the English tongue is
spoken people know the meaning ot
“sportsman." “A fair ﬁeld and mayl
the best man win" is thc supreme law
of all our games and sports. And
that law, observed as a matter ct
honor, on every baseball, lootbail,.
cricket and lacrosse neld, accounts in
no small measure for the magniﬁcent
victories ol the Allies on the western.
tront. Our national sports have made _
us despise "quitting" and the “yellow
streak."

l Several hundred men from the curl-

valescent camp just walked through‘

camp on their way to the train to go
back to duty. You wouldn’t think from
their spirit that they were going out to
risk lilo. They started out singing,
“Hail, Hail the Gangs All Here." but
of course quieted down as they went
through the hospital grounds. They
surely are a gritty bunch. You can't
beat America with such a spirit and
with her resources even it she is ﬁght—
ing thousands or miles from home. Put
,together the ﬁghtvthut her men have
and the determination to see a bad job
through and get home as soon as pos-

that will ucvcr be defeated.
Munitions Explllde.

Hasken and I had to move again
yesterday. That's the iourth or fifth
time that we have moved since we
have been in this place, and I do not
believe that this will be by any means
permanent. We moved dowrl with
Hazard, Watt. and Wires. so old Grin-

nnll is all together again, It is sort‘

of a. private room for ten in it. It
really is pretty ﬁne if we had any
leason to believe that it was to be at
all pcmmneut.

I told you some of my trip to Lynn.
There are two things which stand out
most distinctly. One is the big ex-
plosion and burning of the munition
nlling factory. The other the trip
through and the view from the cathea
arm at Lyons. Tlicy are both wonder-
ful to see and so different.

Shutters Gluss.

\Ve heard the big explosions in the
afternoon but thought nothing of it un-
til toward evening. We Say the lurid
glare in the sky. About nine we were
in the hotel whcn there was a, terriﬁc
concussion and explosion which shat-
tel‘cd glass all over the city. ‘Ve im-
medlately \vcnt out into the street. We
hunted up the nearest French hospital
as there were ﬁve of us and volunteers
ed our Services to the French. We
climbed into a French ambulance (an
Amer-iced medical liiaior joined us)
and We started for the ﬁre. All we
could see was the red glare in front
of use and it seemed as if we were
driving right into it. As a matter 0!
fact they slapped about a. quarter of a,
mile lrom it. There were scarcely any
casualties .50 there was nothing for us
to do. A couple of us decided to go
up closer.

l Sees Cathedrals.

The gcndarmes stopped us but when
we told them we were American medi-
cal nncn they let us by. We got as
far as the wall surrounding and stood
on top or that and watched. It was a
weird and fascinating sight. the lurid
name, the many explosions. and the
shrill whistle oi the shells. We watch
ed for a while, then decided it was
a little too uncomfortable to stay there
so went back. The rest had gone back‘
in a rted Cross car. After walking a
tow blocks we hailed an Italian Artll~
icry wagon and rode into town. '
