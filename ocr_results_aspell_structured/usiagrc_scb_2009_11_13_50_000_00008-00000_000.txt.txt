Looking into
Landlords

litC/lltOLlN SCHOLZ

Housing students in Grinnell may not come
oﬁ” at ﬁrst as the brightest of business moves. With
mythical wild partying ways, renting to students
seems like a hazardous business One would think
that the landlords brave enough to risk property
damage and late rent might want to keep close
tabs on their investment.

But here is the twistimost students living
offtcampus report varying degrees of indiffert
ence landlords have towards their studentrrented
housing.

“Most ofthem don't seem to care that much
about what exactly the students are doing in their
houses," Erica Hougland ’10 said.

Yet however distant and diverse their telntlonr
ships may be, a survey otstudenrs and landlords
found that their interactions tend towards mutual
respect. Both make sure to convey a positive image
ofthemselves—landlords do not invade their ten-
ants’privacy, while students don't burn the house
down in return.

ship with their
renters. “Even

t h o u g h o u r
landlord [Paul Pohlson, with RamseytVVeeks]
just lives down to the road, he doesn't just come by
and check what we are doing. He always waits to
be invited in and doesn't just enter the house, alt
though he technically could," Hart Ford- Hodges
'10 said. “We already told him how happy we are
to have him."

“I would say it’s a relationship of mutual rev
spect,” she said, adding that it might be unusual
how easy they are able to get in touch with their
landlord, to whom they usually deliver their rent
personally.

“He is kind ota fatherly dude," Hougland
said about Pohlson, the landlord for the two-
apartment house at 1203 Main Street she shares
with Ford~Hodges and four other students. He
has also proven to be responsive to student needs.
"He even ﬁxes things we haven’t mentioned.”
she said.

That attentiveness to detail is a welcome
change compared to the work of Pohlson‘s pre-
decessor. "Someone did not do a good job, repairs
were done in an odd way, a lot of things were
broken when we moved in," said FordtHodges
about the former landlord, Rodney Curtis. She
remembers that before and shortly after they
moved in, the landlord was still in the process of
repairing damage done to the house, like replaCt
ing broken windows and repairing a drain in the
kitchen. .

“There were also many ﬁlthy spots that looked
as iithey haven’t been cleaned for years when we
moved into the house,"FordtHodges said.

While a broken window is not necessarily
the legacy one wants to ﬁnd in a new home, the
students also round some interesting items left
by the previous renters. “With houses that are
typically rented by college students like this one,
some sort of tangible history usually accumulates,"
Hougland said.

"lhe stereotypical distant landlord, who has
not cleared out the garage or closets for some
time, not only gives student space, but a little
bit of history to go with it, “We found a lot of
interesting things," Hougland continued, “A lot
of the furniture was already here, the couches for
example. We also found used bed sheets—which
we got rid of [since] we heard nasty stories about
bedbugs in some of the other student housew

and a bike chained to the house, with a Grinnell
biking license that had expired in 1983. It just
adds personality to the house."

Kyle Blair ’10, who lives at 1222 Sixth Aw
enue with two housemates, knows this student»
landlord relationship well,

“Our landlord [Dan Hubncr] is kind ofﬂaky
when it comes to ﬁxing things." Blair said. “It’s
more ota problem to get him to actually do things
than having him around us too inuch,"Although
he is quick to add that the house, shared with
two other students, remains in decent condition,
except for some ongoing basement construction.

Phil Hagen '10,who lives at 1021 High Street
(“I-louse Across the Street from Blank House

House") with three other students, shares Blair’s'

expelience with a relaxed landlord.

“Out landlord [Dave Ford] seems nice,we got
a welcome basket With it bunch of useful items
when we moved in. which I guess is uliusuill,"he
said. “It might also have been because he bought
the house only one day before we moved in "

“i remember him having a lot of grand
plans in the beginning, but 1 don’t think he

condition ofthe housci‘ﬁt's a nice house. it's
livable,"l—lagen said—has not given him and
his fellow renters much reason for concern,

“He seems like a nice guy, if we actually

called and asked him to repair something,
he would probably do it," he continued.
"But we don't really talk to him that much.”
This experience proves true for many or the
studenttlandlord relationships in Grinnell, For
the most part, the only contact between landlord
and student is the paycheck, which solne landlords
do not mind receiving a eouple ordnys late.

"We normally pay our rent in time,but iiwe
are a couple or days late that's okay, too," said
Snehal Kumar’10,who lives at 1215 Elm Street in
a tour-apartment house. Her landlord Ray spriggs
owns other student—tented houses in town and has
held this position for many years, “Which may
explain his general lax attitude when it comes to
dealing with students,"she said.

An employee, who asked to remain anonyt
mous, of Ramsey Weeks, a local eonnpany that
owns some ofthc studentcleased housing (includ
ing Hougland and Ford-Hodges's building), Cone
ﬁrms that the relaxed relationship is mutual. “We
never had any problems with renting property [0
students," she said. “It‘s been a great experience."

Hubner (the aforementioned landlord at 1222
Sixth Avenue) goes into further detail. “Renting
property to students has been a 90 peteent posir
tive experience."

Aside trom the occasional physical damage
brought on by carelessness—like the ceramic
heaterrmelted carpet—he can recall only one
particularly negative event with 3 of the ap—
proximately 200 students he tented property to
within the last seven to eight years. “They were
taking advantage ofme as a landlord ﬁnanClally,”
he explained. “Not paying their rent for example."

But that experience was certainly an outlier.
Reﬂecting on his years as a landlord,he voiced the
conclusion that has often dictated the relationship
between Grinnell students and their landlords.
“Overall 1 feel treated respectfully by the college
students, whom I in turn treat respectﬁllly," he
said.

Hougland agreed. “With most landlords
around town you'll probably more have the
problem of getting in touch with them than
having them actually around a lot controlling
you,”sbe said.
