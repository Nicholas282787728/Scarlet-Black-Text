Transients Debate Continues

The Committee A Commitr
tee on Social Policies and Re-
gulations discussed Wednes-
day for the second week the
problems causedby transients
at the Youngbloods' concert,
but once again took no action.

J.C. Labowitz had drafteda
proposal which laid out some
guidelines for guests on aim-
pus. This emphasized that st-
udents have priority when phye
siml restrictions limit the
number of people tobe served.
The presence of guests sh-
ouldn’t interfer with the stur
dents' enjoyment of college
functions and services. "Gu-
ests will register with resi-
dent advisors along with their
sponsors and obtain an iden~
tity card to signify their sta-
tus as guests."

labowitz added that a defir
nition for guest should be de-
cided upon. Should townspeo~
ple as well as friends of the
students and faculty be called
guests? Steve Mannheimerpo-
inted out that lahowitz seem. .
ed to be talkingaboutpersonal
guests in the original propOe
sal.

Brian Harris suggested that
the “Derby problem" be con»
sidered separately from the
general problem of guests on
mmpus. Ed Levine, South
Forum chairman, raised the
question of how often the
"Darby problem" was likely
to reoccur. Unless there is
some more money next year
there will beno bigrname rock
groups here to perform.
Mannheimer said, and others
agreed, that rules should be

established in any case.

The difficulties in Darby ar-
ose not from the type of guest
there, but their sheer num»
bers. The remedy is to limit
the number of tickets avail-
able to non~students. Dean
Connie Kimbo spoke out in
favor of giving the guest tick’
ets away since the student
tickets are free, but Mannr
heimer and Levine advocated
selling guest tickets.

Labowitz stated that once the
tickets are sold to these peo~
ple they have full use of the
college facilities. If people
come onto campus not know-
ing anyone, they won‘t recog*
nize the duties and responslr
bilities of college guest. "We
should have some mechanism
to identify the people not rese
ponsible to anyone. There
must be some mechanism to
recognize the people who have
the right to college facilities. "
There is also a potential pror
blem with highrschool and
junior-high school students in
the town. At present they are
net allowed to attend Darby
concerts by their parents and
teachers. “I don't think we
should go into the business of
selling tickets to anyone who
shows up." _
At last Mr. Harris moved
that tickets be available only
to college students, and not to
any guests at all. Discussion
of the whole matter was de
ferred until the next meeting.
