New Series.

Chrestomachian.

The program given at last Satur-
day’s meeting of the Chrestontathiart
society was maillly musical; each
number rendered, except the debate,
beinga vocal or illstrumelltal selec-
tion. The program was opelled with
a vocal solo by Mr. O. Risser, who
was accompanied by Miss Kendrick.
The next llrlmber on the program was
music by the Chrestomatian quartet,
which was composed of O, Risscr,
Hamlirl, Crosby and Wiley. The se-
lections rendered were very interest-
ing and amusing, and the singers re-
sponded to all encore. Following the
quartet, Mr. Palmer and Mr. Way fa-
vored the society with a corrret duet,
which was one of the best listened to
by the society for some tinre, but the
players, tlrorrgh heartily urged‘by
their hearers, declined to respond to
an encore.

The Spook orchestra, for the first

. time ill -tlre history of the society,
then appeared rrpoll the ﬂoor. The
music given by the orchestra, as well
as the orchestra itself, was very
amusing, arld interesting. After play-
ing two or three well known pieces,
the orchestra left, but by the contin-

L ued applause of their audience they
were induced to return and responded
to all encore. The society was then
favored with a vocal solo by Miss
Bartlett. Two selections were ren-
dered, one of them being “Ben Bolt."
Both pieces were much enjoyed, The
next number on the musical program
was an irrstl'rurrental solo by Miss
Buchanan

Following Miss Buchanan, the socir
ety listened to ”Music” by the ”Happy
Hollow Band.” The band consisted

‘ ofaleader who did the talking arld
smoked the pipe, and a bass drum,
mouthorgan, tuba and all alto horn.
The band was very entertaining and
was forced to respond to an encore.
The last number on tile musical pro—
gram was given by the quartet, after
which came the debate. The ques-
tion was, Resolved: ”That propor—
tional representation should be adopt-
ed in place of the present system of
electing members of congress.” The
aﬁirmative was supported by McKeag
and the negative by J. E. l’al‘ker. Mr.
McKeag took the grorrrrd that such a
step would eliminate party spirit,
brilrg the voter and representative
closer together, alld that the minority,
which under the present system are

r not represented, would then be repre-

 

sented.
would be a change from the present
Order of things and that it Should be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt
that the change would be beneficial to
the country, that it would give the
party more power, and separate the
voter from tlle representative. Mr.
Meade ill the critic’s report decided
in favor of the MT nrative.

Glee Club.

The work of the Glee Club so far
this season indicates that tltis year’s
club Will be the strongest in the his»
tory of the college. Before the club
began its practices, it was known that
so far as voices welrt, it was stronger
than ever before, but it remained for
the members to show hnwthey would
work together, arid with what spirit,
before it could be stated that the club
as a whole w; ‘ stronger. The club
opens it’s year’s work with twenty
members, five oil each part, alrd all
the parts well balanced. Tire work
already dorle this year is far lrlore
than has been done in the same time
ill previous year's. With the material
ill the club, and the spirit exhibited by
all tlle members at practice, the out
look for a good clrrb was never brightr
er. The membership is as follows:

Mr. Wilson’s address to the men of
the college orl Sunday afternoon,
served to intensify still further the
impression which his earnest words
have lnade. The central poillt of his
discourse was the thought tllat there
must be some final meaning to human
life, something witllorlt which all life
is meaningless arid through which all
life ﬁnds its interpretation. It is our
duty to adjust ourselves to this true
reality which lies within rrs.

 

lOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25. l599.

 

The negative held that it‘no difference what one believes pro—

vrded only that the adjustment takes
place. Every lnan has a moral capa-
city for knowing the truth which
makes him a man, arld distinguishes
him froln a beast. We are all poten-
tially dlvine, no matter how small or
mean we may be, and we must adjust
ourselves to the realization of this
fact.

The great fact of Christ’s labor is
that he recognized the sacredness and
divillity of human life. To be per-
fectly human is to be divine. Tire
son of God is the son of mail, per~
fectly adjusted to divine life. Christ’s
divirtity was his perfect humanity.

We must convork and cooperate
with the creative presence of God
within us. it is not the ofﬁce of a
nrarr to be merely a spiritual parrot,
but to develop ill accordance with the
operation of a divine larv, There is
a difference between being moral and
living according to the working orlt of
a real principle. All is shadow alld
urll‘eality except God. No matter
where it may guide him, it is man’s
dirty to follow the divilre leading.

With his chapel talk on Tuesday
morning, Mr, Wilson closed his short
season of work among the students
of Iowa college. His presence has
been helpful and conducive to serious
thought, If he is able to return at
any future time he will be gladly wel-
corned by the students.

listl Music.”
