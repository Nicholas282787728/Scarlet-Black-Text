VOX POP SPEAKS IN OKLAHOMA

The legislature which scl 'cs as teammate of
Governor “Alfalfa Bill” Murray of Oklahoma has
before it some legislation as uniquely inept as
an of the antics of the executive branch. particu-
lzn y in regard to saving some of the money spent
on education.

It is proposed to forbid sabbatical leave on
pay for professors, to compel all professors to
teach in the clas ‘00)“ 35 hours ft week, to remove
all but the ‘leflrllcd subjects’ from the curricula,
to remove all freshmen and sophomores from the
state university and Oklahoma Agricultural and
Mechanical college. and to reduce all salaries, probe
ably about 25 per cent,

It is highly improbable that all or even the
majority of these measures will pass. Yet the fact
that they are seriously proposed is significant of
the difficulties under which state institutions labor.

It is evident that the proponents of such laws
have no appreciation of the great necessity of
change to a man who is to teach countless students
with inspiration and understanding; of tile import-
ance of all teachers seeking continually new meth-
ads of teaching; of the need of continual intensive
study to keep up~toedztte and informed, and, filial-
ly, of the incstimolnc value to the future of attract-
ing the best talent tllc country can offer into tllc
teaching profession.

There are times when it seems as if the gener
ously supported state institutions have made pr)
vatc colleges almost obsolete. Incidents like this
remind people that the demos has not yet the wis-
dom requisite to the control of education. For
many years to come the private college will be an
indispensable bulwark against ignorant misundcre
standing of the needs of educational institutions.

GRINNELI. REALLY UNIFIED

The argument has been brought foi‘ll'ﬂl‘d that
Grinncll is really uniﬁed, and that the meetings
which have been held to consider this are merely
making a problem where none exists. Exponcnt
of this theory base their claims on this: that
Grinnell were to filed a test, it would be found
as compact as ever.

Grilincll lifts faced the t st, lmd although at
times it came through, the times when it. did not
are dangerously frequent. The Varsity club gave,
a chance for unity to express 'tsclf. How the club
did not wllolly succeed, and how those who did
join had to pay for those who did not, is common
knowledge.

The failure of mixed dinners is another matter
that is significant. The nusp us beginning of the
Pioneer club has been followed up by nothing,
The problem of it look of ccllcctivc chapel singing
comes up pcrcnuihlly, without mucll effect.

The situation is not altogether without hope.
There has been encouraging attendance at cc , '
lectures, at vcspcr scrviccs, and at the recent cone
vocation. But thcl‘c is something lacking. Ollc per-
son could not clear up the problem. It needs on
intcrcstcd group, or a dialing projci.

BLUEJAYS TAKE TO THE AIR
(From the Creightoninii)

Nobody can say that the Creighton Bluejays are
not high ﬂying birds. Figuratively speaking, the has-

ketball men spread their wings like‘the aggressive
bird from which they get their name and ﬂew down

to battle with the Oklahoma Aggies last week. In a
luxurious cabin plane, members of the squad, Coach
Schabinger, and Freshman Coach Belford made the trip
to Stillwater in a little over four hours of flying time.

The ﬂight itself is not such a wonderful feat in the
light of present day travel by air, yet the trip empha-
sizes the fact still further that Creighton is keeping
abreast of everything smattering of progress. and that
the trend on the Hilltop is definitely toward advance-
ment. ’

The far seeing pioneers who founded and endowed
this university little dreamed that Creighton athletic

teams would some day be ﬂying forth to carry the fame
of the university into other schools. Coach Schabinger

and the athletic department are to be congratulated on

their initiative and upon the incentive they have y'vcn

the basketball squad through the jaunt into the clouds.

CENSORSHIP 0F COLLEGE NEWS
(From the Slmpsonian)

Frequently the suppression of college news or edi—
torial comment is a topic of discussion.
_ The Simpsonian. like most other newspapers of
the smaller colleges, has a more or less strict censor-
ship of printed matter, particularly in respect to edi—

‘torial opinion. Any editorials which the editor believes

may be of questionable sympalthy with administrative
policy of the college are supposed to he brought before
the administration for consideration before publication.

Occasionally a Simpsonisn editor neglects such
caution or does not consider it necessary. On such
occasions he is generally subject to more or less humili—
ating criticism.

Consequently there are certain topics which, through
experience of past editors, are known to he editorial
material that can not be commented upon with impunity,
and are therefore left strictly alone.

The question in such cases always arises as to
whether or not a college editor should be allowed to
exercise his own judgement in decisions regarding ma—
terial printed in his paper. There are generally two
arguments in favor of censorship. The ﬁrst is that a
college editor lacks mature judgment; the second, that
the suppression of certain facts is to the best good of
the college.

in our opinion, neither argument is really valid,
It is of course true that the college editor frequently
lacks mature judgment, 0n the other hand, how is he
to acquire judgment without exercising it? The appre-
ciation of responsibility for what he prints will prevent
the publication of harmful material.

The second argument can best be answered by
quoting the mature opinion of others than college edi-
tors. Nelson A. Crawford, as quoted in the Epsilog. says
that “the effect of suppression in college is to teach the
student that such practice is”ethica Edward E. Nich-
olson, dean of student affairs at the University of Minne~
sota, says that "the ill effects of censorship far out-
weigh the difficulties and embarrassments that may
result from the unsound judgment of students,"

Non-censorship of college news has been found suc—
cessful wherever tried. Stanford university and the Uni-
versity of North Carolina are outstanding examples.
Stanford has never had a college publication scandal.
Instead of censorship, North Carolina goes to the oppu~
site extreme of sending out such “questionable” stories
as ofﬁcial news of the university news bureau.

Robert w. Madry, quoted in Epsilog. says that in-

stead of harming the university by keeping all such
secrets of the school open to the public and the press,

such :1 fair attitude at North Carolina has, in his opin-
ion, helped the university. North Caroliua in the last
decade has almost trebled in enrollment and mainten—
ance funds.

Story by Virginia Read
on ‘The Perfect Alibi’

An article written by Virginia
Read, entitled "The Perfect Alibi
Production Problems," appears in the
Janual'ychbrllary issue of Players
Mngltzine, which is published by the
National Collegiate Players.

Miss Read, who was workshop di-
rector for the production of ”The‘
Perfect Alibi” here Nov. 1243. gives
details of solving production prob-
lems of the play. She also explains
the construction of the set as it
ﬁnally appeared.

In a personal letter to Mrs. Sara
Sherman Pryor. who directed the
play, the editor of the magazine says:
“You certainly must have an interest
ed and cooperative group of students
to do all that work on a set.”

Mention of the annual contest held,
here for the Henry York Steiner;
Memorial prize in playwriting and‘
the prize in production is made in
the same issue of the magazine.
