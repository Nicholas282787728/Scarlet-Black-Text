The present organization or the

enough in an emergency. while an
executive committee could temporal»
ily take charge.

The problem 0[ developing
stronger spirit of fellowship among
the lnen in the dormitories was con,
sidered. it was recommended that
upper-classincn should take more in-
terest in the activities of the [leslh
inch men, their studies, campus work,
etc. in order to encourage this spirit
in the dormitories.

The Senate definitely decided mat
the amount of money to be spent in

be limited, although the fixing oi the
amount will he done at a litter date.

The need for a better knowledge
