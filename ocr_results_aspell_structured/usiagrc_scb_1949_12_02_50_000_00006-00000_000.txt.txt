In last week’s column I merk
tioned that we had cranberry
sauce at Thanksgiving dinner;
this soon proved to be a near
fatal error. Monday a great vols
ume of letters poured into thel
SdtB office demanding to
know why I had cranberry
sauce while the remainder of
the student body didn’t. Eesi
cause of copy deadlines the col-
umn was written the day be-
fore Thanksgiving. My most
humble apology for this gross‘
error.
