Grinnell Production’s Freestyle

Weekly open mic night blends town and college talents

Stall Writer

Freestyle. it sounds like something
you do along to rap or techno music,
and anybody new to Grinnell cere
tainlywouldn't rceognize it as Grinnell
Producrions’ version of open mic

calls anyone who hasn’t been to a ses

Though the format seems like it

And Rachel Vanek '01 closed out
the session for September 15 with a

After all, nobody wants to embarrass

Nuclear Brothers

Comedy duo on air Thurday mornings

by Erik Gable
Staff Writer

Thursday mornings
on KDIC explode with a
blast this semester with
the Nuelear Brothers, a
twoeman talk and cam-
edy team composed of
Vivek venugopal and Kumail Naniiani.

Why call themselvts tho Nuclear Brothers? “l’m from India.
he’s from Pakistan,” etplainod Venugopzlt

Then Naniiani jumped in: “Both ofour countries have hair»
nested the awesome power ofthe bomb," he said. “People think it’s
because ofVivek’s dynamite personality and explosive sense ofhu.
mor/diarrhea. but it’s not."

That’s the kind ofrapid hackezndeforth that eharaeteriaos the
rapport betwcerr'the two sonior computer seience maiors, both on
the air and 06‘. They've known eath other for three years, but "it
seems like I've known him all my life," said Nanjiani,

“it seems like we were born brothers," venugopal nontinued,
“but separated by the politieal diseord between our two nations."

How would the Nuelear Brothers describe themselves? “We
combine the good looks ofoavid Letterman and the comedic bril-
lianee of Fabio," Naniiani said, sending the pair oit on a tangent,
speculating about Fahios eomedie talent or laek thensof. He makes
us laugh Nanjiani finally ooneluded. He brings Joy to our lives

Every week the pair bring a eompus celebrity on the air as
their guest Theirrirst guesrwas son Vite president George Carroll
Their second guest was supposed to be Adam Grareh, but sinee
crateh was ill, Carroll stepped in again. “Adam crateh, only with
less hair. and more Asian," they desrribed him.

They also hold a number orcontests, with prizes ranging from
a high teeh spate pen ( the inventor claims that the ghost of his
dead father holped him invent it, Naniiani explained) to a dare
with Ali Walsh.

Larger prizes include ﬂanpanel monitors from lnsrab and the
SGA offices. “We tried to give away George Carroll's vice presi—
dency, but nobody wanted it," Nanjiani said.

Another weekly feature is the_rop.seven list, with such entries
u “Signs it’s time to leave the party" and “Sign: you're not getting
along with your roommate."

We made it the top seven list so we mn‘t get sued for oopye
right infringement, venugopal said.

“I dont think you can oopyright the word ten.
mused

“Ifyou'rc David Letterman. you ean," venugopal shot back.

What else should the SérB’s readers know about the Nuclear
Brothers.>

“We enjoy singing, dancing, and long walks by the beach,"
said ventigopal.

”Cleveland Brseh," added Nanjiani.
