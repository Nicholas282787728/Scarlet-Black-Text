Has your experience and your extensive work in your
field made you more skeptical ofthe power ofyouth activism
as opposed to scholarship and research? What place do you
think students like
those at Griiinell
have in this debate?

Peck: The fact is
that when I get int
volved in an issue—,1
get fully involved in
that issue. It comes
from the faith that
I can make a differ-
ence here. You know,
I can jump into the stream of history, and guide it in a di—
rection to some extent. That faith has not changed in thirty
years oi practice. so part or what I am doing, regardless of
whether you agree with me or don’t, is to suggest to young
people that they can make a difference too. It doesn't have to
be as a constitutional lawyer, but they should know its their
lives and their country and their world at stake.

What do you think is the most inﬂuential thing that
you have personally done in your career?

Peck: There are different things... [W]ithln days of
[9/11] the U.S. airlines went to Congress and asked for im»
munity from congress from any lawsuits, because they were
responsible for any failures in security. [T]hey basically said
that they would lose their insurance and not be able to fly in
the aftermath ofthat. l was one ofthe few people who said
to congress ifyou're going to do something for the airlines,
you need to do something for the families of the victims. 1
was asked to draft a statute that would do that, which be-
came the Victims Compensation Fund, was something that
I did the ﬁrst draft of. So that’s something that I had an
impact with.

What do you think might be some of the most danger-
ous threats to the fabric of our way oflife from this “hard

”[Iile constitution] tolerate: hate
speech. The ﬁrst amendment has a
sort of safety l/o/l/e funttion to it.”

right turn," the subject ofyour speech tomorrow?

Peck: I think that we're going to see an erosion of indi-
vidual rights. The court is going to consider them less wor-
thy ofrespect.The fact that there are less opportunities to go
to courts when you are dissatisfied with the political process.
So you’re going to see the standing doctrine invoked more
frequently, saying that no one has standing to raise this ques
tion before the court. Since 1968, the idea that as a taxpayer,
ifyour money was being spent to promote religion, that you
had standing to challenge that the government was taking
a position on one side or another, and that this violated the
separation ofchurch and state. Just a couple oryears ago, out
of nowhere without any expectation that this was going to
change, the Supreme Court said no, that that’s not enough
standing, that you have to be individually and adversely er—
fected iii a way that no one else is, which is a pretty tough

thing to prove, so as a result, almost no ones going to be able
to bring those lawsuits anymore.

We've had some incidents of hate speech at Grinnell,
trying to intimidate various groups around campus. How
does constitutional law deal with hate speech?

Peck: [The constitution] tolerates hate speech. The first
amendment has a sort of safety valve function to it, By ale
lowing this not to be underground. to be out in the open, it
allows others to organize against it, and to combat it with
good speech. on the other hand,ifthe speech becomes more
intimidating than just speech, then it goes beyond advocacy
[T]o the extent that hate speech crosses the line to that
sort ofinrimidation it is subject to legal constraint

Progressive Fallon challenges Rep. Boswell

1W DAVID Hr MONTGOMERY

Leonard Boswell has represented Grinnell alid the lest oflo-
wa’s Third District in Congress fol more than a decade. With his
seniority and prominent positions on the Agriculture aiitl InKClT
ligence committees, Boswell is noted for his success in bringing
pork barrel funding to the district~$404 million alone in crop
subsidies from 200372005.

But Boswell's votes on certain key issues~most notably his
vote to authorize the use of force in Iraqihave drawn anger
from the left wing ofthe Democratic party and led to a primary
challenger: former state representative and former gubernatorial
candidate Ed Fallon.

Fallon criticizes Boswell in sharp, if measured, terms. He ac-
cused Boswell in an interview ofbeing “out of step, not just with
Democrats but with a majority of the residents of the district."
and said that ““a lot ofpeople" see Boswell’s ““record as more sup—
portive of Bush’s agenda” than ““the priorities of the American
people."

Grant Woodard ’06. Boswell's field director, dismissed the
charges.

“I think that at the end of the day, congressman Boswell's
been a strong Democrat throughout his career," Woodard said.
“He might not be the most liberal member of congress, but 1
think that leﬂects pretty well who he is as an individual."

Fallon's campaign is two-ptonged. Fltst, he has a laundry list
or particular votes on which he thinks Boswell took the wrong
positron, from giving trot breaks to oil and gas companies to sup
porting immunity from prosecution for telecommunications
companies that cooperated with federal wiretapping.

Second, Fallon attacks Boswell on campaign finance and
ethics. According to openscctetserg, 74 percent oi Boswell's
fulldralsing in 2007e8 has come from political action commit—
tces (PACs). PACs have higher donation limits than individual
candidates do, and can be run by cotpomtions, unions, interest

groups or individual candidates. Fallon criticizes PACs and said
that he has never taken FAC money.

Woodard said that the “vast majority” ofBoswell's fundraise
ing from PACs comes from labor unions. “1 know it's politically
popular to deride [PACs] and claim that they’re this evil, evil
thing, but they do represent real people."

Opensecretsorg reports that in zoom, 48.8 percent ofBoe
swells PAC money came from business groups and 27.4 percent
from unions In 20054:, he raised 38.5 percent from business
PACs, and 24.2 percent from unions.

The Boswell campaign responds principally by arguing that
Boswell can win general elections and that Fallon cannot.

“I think [Boswell is] one of the few Democrats that can Wm
this district," Woodard said. “This is not that liberal a district."

Boswell supporter and Foweshiek County Democrats Chair
Don Smith, History, agreed. He said that he thought Fallon was
too liberal for the “close"Third District. “I think we’ve been for-
tunate to have a Congressman who’s in tune sufﬁciently with the
people in his district to keep the district in Democratic hands,”
Smith said,

Fallon and his supporters insist that Fallon can win a geneml
election, pointing to Boswell's recent narrow victories as signs
not of a close district but ofBoswell‘s weakness.

"Boswell should be doing a lot better," Fallon said. “But his
positions are out of step, notjust with Democrats butwith a ma
jority ofthe residents ofthe district.l think he’s been fortunate to
win. I'm conﬁdent that I'm going to do better in the fall election
than he did."

Boswell's campaign also pushes back on the issue ofcamr
paign finance. Much of Fallon’s hrndraising has come through
the organization Democracy for America (DFA), whlch is dedie
cates to “electing progressives up and down the ballot," according
to DFA Political Director Charles Chamberlain, DFA, a regis-
tered PAC, has not donated any money directly to Fallon,but has

encouraged us more than 600,000 members to donate to Fallon's
campaign. By mideFebruary, DFA members had donated more
than $35,000 to Fallon.

“Mr. Fallon stems like he wants to have it both ways,”wo-
odard said. "He wants to hinge on this slight distinction of direct
donations He claims that he won't accept PAC money, but we
don't see the diﬁerence between" PAC donations and donations
by DFA members.

Chamberlain ofDFA dismisses this attack. “I think that's a
rather cynical attempt by the Boswell campaign to misrepresent
events," he said. “Our PAC did not contribute a dim: to the
Fallon campaign, and ifwe had, it wouldn't be accepted."

Amidst the attacks, what remains uncertain is if Fallon will
pose a serious challenge to Boswell. Former Iowa Democratic
Party Chair Gordon Fischer said that while things could change,
“I tend to think that [the primary] wlll notbe that competitive."

Neither campaign says they expect the race to be easy, and
both intend to campaign on college. students for Fallon coaleade
er John Aylrng ’08 said that he thinks “that generally speaking
the positions that Grinnell students have are closer to Fallon's
than to Boswell's," and expressed optimism that Fallon would
win thc college “ifsmdents are irirormed."

Students for Boswell Leader Nathan Clllbb Y11 said that his
group intends to campaign vigorously, pushing their message
that Boswell is a loyal, moderate Democrat and that Fallon is u“,
clectabieThey also have high hopes that a nudeApril campaign
visit to campus by Boswell and us. Representative Barney Frank
(DeMA) will persuade students to vote for Boswell.

The primary election is June 3, but students will be able to
vote on campus on April 30 at a special satellite voting station.
