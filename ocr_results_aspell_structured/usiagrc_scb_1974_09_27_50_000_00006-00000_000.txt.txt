Bike chase to r011

by Michael Bl'nyndick

whirlwinds or speed and ex-
citement shall sweep away the
mists oi academia this Sunday,
Sept. 29 at 2 p,m. when the ﬁrst
annual “Great. Grinncll Bicycle
Chase" roars past the campus.

This college-community event
will realure a restive arternoon ol'
..roi~mal bicycling and lowskey
competition lolloweol by a picnic in
Merrill park, Blcyclists and
spectators are all inviteol to come
out and join in on the sunshine and
ion.

The lI-i mile course will start and
iinish at the corner or loth and

Park Street There will be girls"

and boys' divisions of riding as well
as age brackets for the younger
riders. For one to ten yearsolds
there will be a one lap Chase, for
eleven to sixteen ycarplds there
will be a two lap chase; and for
sixteen up there will he an option or
three five. or eight lap chases
Colll-se layout

Those bicyclists riding in the
latter chases can ride in as many or
them as they wish. The cnclosed
circuit, okayed by the city Council,
vi-iil have marshals at every in-
lersection. The course will cover
the rolling streets around the
country Club, through Merrill Park
lo Bill Street, and then back down

Park Street past Gates, Clark,
Dibble, and Norris halls of the
campus,

The object of The Chase, ac
cording to Rad Actonrthat
renowned hicyclist and s.A. lrom
Dibble hallv, is “to expose the
bicyclers of the Grinllell area
simply, to each other, so that they
will become aware or the growing
popularity oi bicycling," He
believes that bicycling can be seen
as a means oi getting outside the
contines oi the campus, oi ex-
pansion as well as exercise, ol
cnjoyment as well as trans
sportation.

Thus, he hopes that. the “Great
Grinnell Bicycle Chase” will act as
a catylst ior lulure bicycling get-
lngethers, enabling people to meet
\\lm would not normally go out
riding by themselves,

Registration terms were put in
mailboxes Tuesday, However,
these terms were just to give the
organizers, headed by Acton, an
idea of how much food to buy lot
the picnic dinner scheduled alter
the chasesi The picnic will be free
for all who come to ride or watch
the chase.

To paraphrase Acton. straighten
yollr saddles, grease your gears,
and come out Sunday alternoon
and have a good time.
