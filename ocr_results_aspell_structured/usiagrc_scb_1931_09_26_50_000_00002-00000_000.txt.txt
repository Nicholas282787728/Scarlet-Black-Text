AN INDIVIDUAL PROPOSITION

There are people, yes, even college students.
who think of college as an intellectual cafeteria
where those desirous of knowledge collie to choose
this, that, and the other course as their momentary
and ﬂeeting whims dictate in the hope that by some
mysterious, though unfailing, power an education
will automatically be grafted on the normal indie
viduol. Within this conception of on education is
the implication that lifter long research mid study
scholarly men have discovered and interpreted the
facts ill their respective ﬁelds with such accuracy
and insight that conclusions beyond question can
be served to the willing.

Few professoi would even choose to have stu-
dents listen to their lectures with such unwarrant-
oblc reverence because they realize that very few
questions, big questions, can he answered yet. All
that any instructor can do is give the results of
research and Sludy, as inadequate as they 111‘ y be,

LIGHTS NEEDED

It is unfortunate that students who use the
library must be forced to 'tudy in the poor light
that is offered on the fi ﬂoor. Most students
will ogrcc to the truth of this. Anyone wllo has
not experienced watery eyes lined ~turly bllt two

everyone and many must study on the lower flonl'.
\Vhy cannot table lamps be installed? The cost
should be a secondary consideration, but the bill
ought not to be large.

It would be best to use hluc bulbs for the lamps,
since they give light which is better for eyes than
light given by ordinary bulbs The plan deserves
consideration as a health lllcll ll‘O if for no other
reason.

MG
SOME IMMEDIATE RESULTS

It is prcsulliplious to try to check up on the
department of public relations just two yours after
its ofﬁcial beginning: It was anticipated that there
would be no cslllts for several year. There arc
certain immediate results that have llccll obvious
enough to point already a justification [or the late
President J. H. T. Mnin’s establishing of the of-
ﬂees.

Ill ll score of years there will he ﬁgures, and
ﬁgures are hard to obtain now. There are cln'ﬂll-
incnt numbers, of com In 1929 there was a
bumper class of 239 freshmen, which dropped to
203 beginners in 1930, That was a bad your, and

the (l01)lll‘l,lll(llll had barely still-ted. Thi. your, un-
qucslionnbly n llllrdcr oilc ﬁnances are consid-
ered, lllel'c arc something li c 230 freshmen. This
illcroilsc since lost your hardly lllulics up the ch-
peurlilurr for the ofﬁce and stall".

Since the collage cull assimilate only a certain
number of new students, and since freshman living
quarters are crowded to capacity this year, the
problem of swelling l'lllllx’S proves itself not to have
been of ﬁr importance. The real question is iii the
quality of students brought here by the deport-
lilclll

Figures on the percentage of people who do
not make the grade are uliohlnilloblc. The col-relu-
llou hrtu-ccti high school nnrl college grades is
l’llth‘l‘ close, and the public rcllltions department
has little time for under-average prospects. II. is
safe to hazard zt guess, therefore, that studcnls
who fail are not brought here by this department.

Rcsulls of the freshman ilitclligcllcc tests rm:
kept. from publication, but lliosc wllo guard the
ﬁgures hint that this year’s Ir
a startling abundance of gcnill. . This must be
the ﬁnal test of the worth of tho publicity depart-
lucnt~ whose method is to seek out the most desir-
able high school students and convince them that
Gl‘lnllell is the place to come.

’I‘hcrc are other considerations of less illIPOl‘A
(once including the wider lcrl'itorv lloochcd,
ousicr orientation for people who have led nCLl
something of the college from its rep utofi
and better feeling for Grillncll on the part of othe .
in the towns visited. These arc harder to check.

Several years? Perhaps one cannot szly until
then that the department pays for itself. One may
at least Conjecture on the bnsls of present facts.
The Scarlet and Black stands ﬁrmly in favor of
extending all help to the group which represents
Grinncll to the world at large.

SPAIN IN DANGER

Spain took a decided stop ill advance in
breaking from luonnl’cllilll rule, and should keep
progress in the smile tenor that has been character-
istic of this notion silicc achieving freedom. Now
that accomplishment has llccli made along molly
lines, a seeming i'cuctioll appears.

It the time now spout ill rluihhling' about the
future llzlmc of the republic could be dcvotcd To
more pertinent llmllci Spain would be greatly
beneﬁted. Of course i is important to decide
\vhcthcr the count is to be called {I Republic of
Workers or not, but it is more important to insure
the success of the government.

Colnlliuuislll and Roman C lllolicisui are both
doing their best to run the C,‘ tillioli ship of state
aground, and although they are working for (lif-
fercnt reasons, the finish of this new republic will
be , st as complete if it falls under the control of
either.

NO MORE GRADES
(From the Des Monies Register)

Grinnell college has adopted a policy of withholding
the grades of student‘s until graduation. Each Student’s
work will be reported as satisfactory, poor, or falling.
butiif the new system is retained and adhered tore
detailed rating will not be available until the college
course is completed.

This new plan will Work considerable hardship on the
student who habitually soft-soaps his teacher and ef-
fects an unfelt interest in the course in hope of boosting
his grades. It will discourage the cared who sheds briny
tears for the same purpose. Arid it will give little coll»
solntlon to the type of student who is certain to be a
clock-Watcher after he leaves the campus.

But the effect of such a plan on the student who
goes to college to learn as much as he can should be
beneficial; its shift of emphasis from grades to the
Iutlanientnl purposes of education should he healthful to
both teachers and students. It should encourage slic-
cessful courses instead of snap courses, genuine learn-
ing lnstearl of blurring.

7G—
ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION
(From the Coc college Cosmos)

As we xppl’oach the end of the ﬁrst week of college,
we cannot help but notice how the student's time and
energy is already being diverted by the numerous activi-
ties. This realization causes us to wonder if the college.
the fraternities and sororities, antl extra-curricular
activities are not all asking and expecting too much
from the college men and women?

The college person i' asked to be both a Scholar
anrl a participator in activities, 131 a number of groups
there are systems in vogue which require members to
attend so many activities at Week. The college asks this
individual and that to rpresent the college in this line
or in that. Are they asking too much?

We are quite in agreement with the idea that some
individuals so enjoy to express, when they say that a
college education is not completed unless the class room
has been supplanted with an extracurricular activity
of some nature. As to the value of dramatics, intra—
murals, publications, musical organizations, department
al club's, ancl honorary societies we do not wish to di
pute or even question, We urge that the college stu—
dent choose the particular sphere which affords him
the best opportunity.

It is quite possible to be both a student and an
activity personality, but is is impossible to be both a
student of note and a participator in activities. The
activity personality rncrely attends to get credit for
such, while the participator is of that type which gives
a deﬁnite contribution to the organization, striving to
further the interest or the group.

The majority of students have dipped into too great
a number of extl'a-curriular activities, their diversiﬁca-
tion being beyond their comprehension. Their vnst mem-
bol‘ship is detrimental to any beneﬁts which come from
faluiful attendance and interest in a few well chosen
fields. Select from the many activities, majoring as it
were, in that activity that you will be able to derive
the most proﬁt through your membership and your
participation.

Dear Si

Why must the students of Grim
nell college continue to pay 45 and
50 cents [or movies? The price of
football tickcts, haircuts, groceries,
clothing, and many other commodr
itles have been whittled down to
half of what they were last June,
but the theaters continue to charge
the same price.

Why, through The Scarlet and
Black, could not a plan be formuc
laterl whereby there would be an-
nounced a Student night every week
by the movie houses. on which night
the price of admission would be 25
cents. By such a plan patronage
would be stimulated for the theaters,
and at the same time the students
already lean pocketbooks would be
spared unnecessary draining.

Yours truly,
John Thomas
