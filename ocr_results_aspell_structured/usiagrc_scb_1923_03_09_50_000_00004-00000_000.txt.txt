Maynard Barnes
Wins Promotion

‘lRewartied for Services
Smyrna. Recently.

Is at

The il‘lends‘of Maynard B. Ear~
nes, who graduated in 1919. will be
interested to learn that he has heen
given a donhle promotion, as are
sult'oitliis remarkable work during
the great tire in Smyrna, and is
now a full consul in that city. The
Senate confirmed the promotion.
Friday afternoon, and secretary
Hughes cahlcd the news to Mr. Bar-
nos.

The promotion came as a result or
recommendations l'roni~ Admiral
Bristol, 11. 5. High Commissioner at
Constantinople, and Commander
Hepburn of the Navy Department.
The ofﬁcial report or his action
states, in ,part, “Aside from his or
ceptional efficiency in the pert-mn-
ance of important and dirticult due
ties" his general hearing was in it-
self a very positive inl'luence .in
'hromo'ting continence and prevent
ing rillsconsldered action on the part
of the others. The example not by
Barnes during this memorable time
should he recorded with pride 1n
the annals oi; the consular service.

It is hoped by the State Depart—
ment that this promotion, coming as
a recognition or'Mr. Barnes' services
in times of stress, will serve as an
incentive and example to other
the annals of the consular service.
to so distinguish themselves when
the occasion arises.
