Swimmers Cop Win In Cliffhanger

There was no question last
Saturday as to which school,
Grinnell or Cornell, had the
better swim team. Grinnell
won, 58746, but it took the
Aqua—jocks until the last relay
to prove their point. It was
Grinnell’s 15th dual meet vic*
tory in a row.

The meet started with a
standing ovation by both
squads, celebrating the fact
that this was to be the last
meet held in “Tempo Pool,"
Then a most bizarre event
occurred. Steve Ward (Gabby)
suffered what was most ob-
viously an attack ofthe "Siekr
ertsSyndrome." OnHalDale's
third lap of his butterfly, in
the medley relay, Gabby, con-
fused in the excitement, jump—
ed to the blocks and dove in on
Hal two laps early. Gabby
swam exceptionally fastas the
relay broke the school record
by 42 seconds. Of course they
were disqualified and behind
7’0.

Cornell then swept the 1000
and Grinnell was behind i5>l.
Beak streaked to victory in
the 200 but Swacky got touched
out for second. The fact IS,
Grinnell got touched out in
every close race but some

Roundbollers Drop To Cellar

Last weekend and last Tues~
day Grinnell’s basketball for
tunes took a turn for the worse
(you may recall Grinnell's
second win ofthe season pulled
them out of the cellar) as the

' Pioneers lost in succession to
Ripon, 84766, Lawrence,
77-72, and Beloit, 65‘61 to
return to the cellar.

Against Ripon there was no
Second-Half Fade Syndrome
for the simple reason that,
after the first ten minutes of
the game, the Pioneers were
never close enough to fade.
Ripon, in garnering its 12th
consecutive win, raced off to
a half— time lead of 43-27 and
were never challenged in the

' second half. In this game, the
Pioneers not only plaued a
poor offensive game, they had
a bad night defensively and
under the boards. Grinnell
splattered the nets at a 33%
rate from the field and sur-
rendered a fatal rebounding
edge, with Ripon pulling down
53 rebounds to Grinnell’s 37.
Bob Burnett led all scorers
with 27 points while Chuck
Patterson canned 19 in a_sup—
porting role. Mike Delaney
had 20 points for Ripon, while

Ron Cooper and Jeff Trickey
had 18 and 16, respectively.
The Lawrence game was
quite a different matter as the
Syndrome struck in force. The
Pioneers led at the half, 42-
37, before yieldingto the pres—
sure of the Vikings and their
old nemesis, the foul shot. In-
deed, foul trouble was fatal.
The Pioneers, in spite of hit-
ting only 3470 of their field
goal attempts, eased in three
more buckets then did the
Vikings; however, Lawrence
enjoyed a game long parade
to the foul line as they scored
25 points via the free throw,
while Grinnell got only 14. For
the second night ina row, Burr
nett led the scoring with 34
points. He was assisted by
Bruce Bonnewell with 14 and
Greg Bombinski with 10. Strat
Warden paced Lawrence with
28, while Kevin Gage netted
19, and Jim Dyer scored 17.
The game against Eeloit pita
ted the Conference’s cellar
dwellers against each other.
The home court proved noad—
vantage as Grinnell again lost
in the second half. The Pion—
eers led for most ofthegame,
often by as much as IUpoints,

Bailey Bags 43

Last Tuesday the preps went
down to defeat as Central
overcame a 43 point blast by
the youthful Bill Bailey to hang
on to an 82-75 win over the
Young Pioneers.

The preps generally foilow~
ed the varsity's script for
losing in that they had one bad
half and one good half, except
that, with the preps (you know
how Freshmen are; they can't
get anything right the first

how, still won. J. Rollie and
Dork swept the 60. Gabby and
Mark Williams duplicated the
feat in the Individual Medley.
Pontoon played dead to the
townie’s Alerothing, Chuckie
L. in the diving.

Hal Dale almost hung him-
self on the rope as Cornell
took 1~2 in the 200 fly. Gabby
and Rollie won the 100 free.
Brammer took second in the
200 back, while Flecky got
touched out for third. Then,
the Beak humbledAndy Apples
bee in the 500, but Dan Wiess
got touched out for third. C.D.
Meyer rampaged in the 200
breast while Mark took third,
as Gibby got sick.

The score was 5146 going
into the last relay. Both teams
were without their stars as
Andy and Gabby had already
swurn three events. Grinnell
won as Beak, Swacky, Dork,

and J. Rollie came through.
By the way, it seemed as the
ough J. Rollie got a cramp on
the last lap and swam the re-
maining strokes with his foot
elevated, or at least that is
what his mother thinks.

The conference meet is this
weekend at Cedar Rapids Jef~
ferson, sponsored by One Cole
lege. Grinnell was picked by
the conference coaches to win
but is closely pressed by
Ripon. A poll showed Grinnell
with six point getters (includ‘
ing Pontoon) and Ripon with
nine. It is obviously up to the
second stringers to win this
one for Grinny.

So, if next week you see a
bunch of short haired guys
walking around, it’s nota narc,
just the swim team. And if
they're smiling, they won!

Wrestlers: Maybe Next Year?

Last week as I wrote this
article, the Grinnell wrest
ling team was sparkling with
all kinds of hope. They are
now flat on their backs again.
Against, or maybe one should
say under, William Penn, the
mat mice only salvaged one
tie. Washington Alston, wr-
estling at 177 pounds, man-
ageda l-l tie.

Watching the match proved
rather fascinating. It seemed
that each Grinnell wrestler
was doing fine ~ with the ear
ception of Aldrich who got
squashed , and then suddenly,
they were pinned.

In a super fiasco Grinnell
went to the Lake Forest In-
vitational. Altogether they
scored one point, made by
Bob Donelan who beat some-
one from Knox in the conso-

In Prep BB loss

they played lackadaisioally,
but they turned around in the
second half and stayed head-
to-head with Central the rest
of the game. In addition to

Bailey‘s spree, Dennis Moss
dropped in 13 points for Grin-
nell, while Dave Swanson and
Kevin Swaide netted 20 apiece
for Central.

The Young Pioneers now take
their 276 record to Monmouth
Saturday where they will be
looking to reverse Grinnell’s
basketball fortunes.

lation bracket of the meet.
This weekend is the confer-
ence meet at Cornell. Grin-
nell is not picked to place
very high so the pressure is
definitely off. Oitside, and
very outside placers, are Bob
Donelan, Rawleigh Buckmas-
ter and Washington Alston.
Perhaps some goodwill come
out of this meet but the chains
ces are slim. Maybe it is
best just to say, "Wait till

next year!" I. C. Lites

Indoor Track Team
