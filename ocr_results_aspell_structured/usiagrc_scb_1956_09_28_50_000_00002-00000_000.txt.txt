Any examination oi Adlai

average mid-westcruer is con-

the speech is to be tound in
the concrete term proposals.

"‘rue to the form ot predom—

potitics, Mr, Stevenson's attack
to 1ke was centered mainly on

ices as percentages at parity,
he compared the years 1952 and
is- : in every case, except that

inabie commodity peanuts, the
hon percentages were higher
than those in 1956.

“Political Expediency"

Again referring to President
Eitenhower's Kasson, Minn.
speech Adlai condemned the for
"brazen political expedr
Emmy“ in leading the tarmers of

ivored and would fight for 90%

ner additives:

Ike's Farm Speech 5 Women Assume Ar+ Displays

In Peoria, lllinois
Defends GOP Idea

By Bob Barr

In a major farm address do»
livered in Peoria, 111,. Tuesday,
President Eisenhower stood sols
idly behind the record of his
admiantratton and blasted what
he Called the “mockery and de—
ceit" and the “political quackr
ery" of the proposed Democrat-
ic farm program.

With two exceptions, farm in
come has declined steadily over
the past ten years. Those ex.
ceptions were during the Korean
war, when prices rose as they
always do in time of war, and
this year, which is the tirst
year of operation of the Eisenr
howel‘~Eenson program,

The reasons lor this downs
ward trend are many, oi
course. Nevertheless, the tact
is that the Dc:nocrntic\pro~
gram or high rigid price sup
ports has certainly not solved
the problem. it must be re—
membered that the Demo~
cratic torinula was in eiiect
up until harvest time last
Year.

Under this program, tremeir
dous surpluses have been amasss
ed which serve only to drive
tar-m prices ever lower: Mr.
Stevenson’s sole answer to this
problem seems to be to cone
tinue the old program which is
a proven failure.

Democratic Stalls

As President Eisenhower
pointed out Tuesday night, the
Democrats take great delight in
shedding great crocodile tears
over the farmer's plight. How»
ever, when the time comes to
do something truly constructive.
they stall and delay for partisan
advantage,

Eisenhower asked the Demr
ocratic congress tor a soil
bank law last January 9 and
none was passed until late in
MaygtooJate to help most
farmers. Despite this, the
Democrats can recognize a
good thing and are now claim-
ing the soil bank as their own
invention, The question which
the President asked Tuesday
night was “ liy didn't they
pass it during the twenty
years that they were in pow-
er?"

In contrast to the Democratic
record, President

Party Differences

The President promised that.
it reelected, he will continue
his policy of strengthening our}
entire free economy. The basic
difference between the Demo
cratic and Republican farm pro-
grams is, it seems to me, (hall
while the Democrats divide our
nation into classes (labor, farms
crs, businessmen, etc) and then
pit class against class by prom-
ising higher prices for farmers
and lower prices tor city dwcllr
