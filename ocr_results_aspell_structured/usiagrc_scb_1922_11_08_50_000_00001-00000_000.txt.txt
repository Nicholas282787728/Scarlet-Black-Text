According to reports from “000”" v-
Huff. Cornell is bringing a Speciall T” Eivt {HBEE PLAYS

Saturday to witness the annual Cor-
nell»(}l~inncll battle. The Cornell
team, after their decisive victory over
Dubllque University last Saturday, are
confident of victory. Although Coach
Diward realizes that the Cornell game
will be a real struggle, he is already
pointing his men toward the Drake
game, ten days distant, and is outlin-
ing a new series of plays to be used
in this game.

Cornell ldcfeated the University of
Dubuquc last Saturday in a well play-
ed game 7 to 0. Only the timely
final whistle saved the Dubuque team
from being scored on for a second
time, as Cornell had the ball on the
one and a halt yard line as the whistle

blew. Cornell was aided by a week of;

rest previous to the game, as they did
not play the Saturday preceding the
Dubuuue game.

Dee the Cornell captain, was the
outsmnding star for Cornell. He has
been playing a whale of a game at
left tackle all season, and will proh-
ahly he depended upon to open up the
right side of the Grinnell line.

Grinnell liaiscs Valley Standing.

Griuncll wallopcd Washington by a
iii to 0 score last Saturday. This was
the ﬁrst victory" tor Grinnell in foot-
ball since becoming a member of the
Missouri Valley conference. In zuldi~
tion to this it gave Washington a
definite claim to the cellar champion-
ship, and advanced the Pioneers to
seventh place, over Oklamoma.

The work of Captain Norelius, Ty
Smitth and Walters, excited much
favor-ably comment Time after time
Norelius would break through the
Washington line, snagging passes and
breaking up Plker formations. Ty

Smith was the outstanding star of[

the game. Playing the greatest game
of his Grinnell gridiron career, he
would get away for long broken ﬁeld.
runs, two of which resulted in touch
downs. Walters also got away for
several/long sprints. Critchett’s too
was responsible for the other marks
ers, when he placed a perfect drop
kick directly between the bars from
the 20 yord line in the fourth quarter,
and also kicked one goal. ,

The woi of the Kingery Brothers
also deserves mention. Forward pass
ses, Ed to Clark, were good for many
of the Scarlet and Black yards in the
first half, and their interference’pavcd
the way for the ﬁrst touchdown.

Judging from Comparative scorcs,
Grinnell seems to hold a comfortable
majority over the Fingerites. The
work of the Grinncll team in this
contest will in a large measure de-
termine their success in the Drake
game, for at the start of the season
Drake defeated Corncll 31 to 7, and
form, the score is a fair indication of
the strength of the two' teams.

The reinvcnatcd Pioneers, playing
the same game that they displaycd
against the Pikcrs, will present a for»
midahle array of plays against the
Drake team. Scrimmage with tho
Frosh team this week is expected to
bring out the strength of the new
Grinnell plays, as well'as the weak-
ness of the Bull-dog formations, so
that thc Pioneers will enter the Drake
Stadium on a nearly equal footing
with the much-touted Drake squad,

The" seats for the Cornell game will

to Live
to Eat? ls Question

to have so pics at hand ready to be
divided into scvcnlhs for the devour-
iug students.

The noonday luncheon is otter cori-
cludcd by more fruit, and the Still
hungry pursucrs take an apple or a
pear as a last resort. It is necessary
to have six bushels or this fruit in
order to suffice their ravishing ape
petites.

There is never a more satisfying
dcsscrt than ice cream. The slogan
established by Mrs. Clinc is “Our Aim
is to Please.” That alone erplains
for ice cream being served at an
average of four timcs weekly.

A probably result will be a shortage
,of dairy products in this immediate
localities, The favorite beverage of
‘tlle students is shown by the con-
,sumption of 75 gallons of ruilk at a
uoonly meal. The product produced
by the baker iu the tom of loaves of
hrciltl, is topped by :00 pounds of
butter weekly, and thrcc thousand dol-
lars worth of mm yearly. ‘

The force bcliind this successful
enterprise consists of Mrs, Cline,
commander-inchicf, scven Chefs, an
assistant, a baker, and the student
helpers. The squad used to transport
the food to the dining room is made
up of eighteen girls and eight men, at
the Quad, and liftccn men at the
Dorm.

It has become a great question
whether the Grinncllians “Eat to
live, or live to eat."
