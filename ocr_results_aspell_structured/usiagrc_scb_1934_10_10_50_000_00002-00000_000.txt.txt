GRINNELL A STEP AHEAD

A second major developement in the slow but
perceptable trend away horn the fraternity system
in university circles and toward the “College
plan,H which has long been in effect at Grinnell,
was marked by a brief article in Monday’s news<
papers,

The news item made note of a growing ac-
ceptance of the college system on the Yale ca
pus, asserting, “A new Yale was knocking omin—
ously Sunday at the foundation of the junior
fraternity system, for nearly a century the corner
stone of the undergraduate social structure on the
campus.”

The announcement is more noteworthy in face
of the fact that Harvard, another member of the
Big Four in the east, definitely abolished fratern»
ity life at that school a little more than a year ago,
Both having long been leaders among the nation’s
educational institutions, should Yale definitely
follow the move of its rival, the step would unr
doubtly wield a wide inﬂuence toward popular—
izing the college plan throughout the country.

The plan which has been in use at Yale
since the beginning of last year provides for
division of the undergraduate body into small
groups comparable to the Grinpell men’s halls.
It also requires students to eat a certain number
of meals in the dining rooms of their respective
groups, and in so doing deprives the fraternities
of an important source of revenue.

New students at Grinncll frequently looki ask—
ance at the absence of social fraternities and are
inclined to feel that they are missing out on a
fundemental Side of college life. As Yale is be-
ginning to realize, and as Harvard has already
acknowledged, the college plan is more desirr
able than the fraternity system. Far from being
backward in its social system, it would appear
that Grinnell is, in reality, a step ahead.

LET’S HAVE SOME PEP

The Grinnell student body seems resolved
to sit back and wait for the Pioneer football team
to give it something to yell about, instead of in
spiring the eleven to success.

No team would have been greatly inspired
by the showing made by the students at the su-
calletl “pep meeting” last Friday at the Alumni
Recitation hall auditorium. A team’s morale is
to a very great extent reﬂective of the attitude on
the campus, and such gross indifference as the
smallness of the audience at this meeting revealed
is bound to effect the team.

A very commendable program had been de-
vised by pep chairmen Gertrude Lynn and Loren
Lindquist to create enthusiasm for the Carleton
game. If the Grinnell men and women will co-
operate with the chairmen in carrying out this
program, it may play a very genuine part in gain—
ing the first Grinnell grid victory in two years.

The game Saturday is a critical one in the
Pioneer schedule. A victory may lead the team
out of its depression and around the Corner to
football prosperity. On the other hand, a defeat
may very possibly result in a second straight sea—
son without a win.

The Pioneer eleven has shown real spirit in its
first two games. The student body can kill it or
increase it, as it sees fit.

G—
PIONEER RESIDENTS COMPLAIN

Residents of Pioneer hall, and other men who
are taking meals there, complain that announce-
ments which are made in the men’s dining room
are not repeated at the new dormitory. As a re
sult, plans for Class elections, campus social
functions and similar news does not reach them
until after the events have occurred.

The men in Pioneer hall should, and can, be
made to feel that they are really an integral part
of the college. In most ways every attempt has
been made to create this feeling. The failure to
make announcements, however, has a tendency to
make the hall’s residents and boarders feel “out
of lt’,’ and some provision should be made to corn
rent the omission.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

THE NEW DEAL FACES A TEST.

The supreme court of the United States has
just convened in what may well become one of
the most momentous sessions in the history of
our country—momentous because the decisions
which it will hand down will have a vital bearing
on our interpretation of the Constitution and the
powers of the national government. Before the
nine justices of the highest court in the land, will
be opposed and defended the unprecedented
actions of our government undertaken in the name
of emergency legislation.

The federal government under the present
administration has imposed codes upon commerce
and industry, codes that may be eniorced with
fine: and imprisonment. Farmers have been
regimented, and compulsory Crop control pracA
ticed. The government has assumcd control over
the values of wages, income and property by the
management of currency and credit.

Whether or not these and many other policies
adopted by the “new deal” government are
economically, or socially sound is not the question,
Whether they overstcp the Americans idea of lib-
erty does not make one particle of difference. The
question before the supreme court is: has the
national government overstepped the powers
whether specifically stated, implied, or interpret—
ed, of the Constitution. Has the New Deal
legislation violated the letter or the spirit of the
Constitution? In time of war the establishment
of a temporary dictatorship is accepted. Is our
peace-time emergency grave enough to warrent
the degree of temporary dictatorship which has
been established. These questions are for the
court to decide. Once they are decided, we must
abide by the court’s ruling, no matter what our
minds or interests dictate.

We are in a period of executive ascendency.
The legislative branch of our government has
endowed extraordinary powers upon the presi-
dent, powers ordinarily possessed only by Con-
gress. In view of the fact that our constitution
embodies the principle of the separation of pow-
ers, an important policy is at stake. Nothing
Could be more important in the continuation of a
representative government than that this legisla—
tive branch retain its inﬂuence and activity in
government. If it loses these, the government

ceases to be representative.

If the Supreme court decides against the New
Deal legislation, our timeehonored interpretations
of the constitution will be retained and upheld.
However, if the court decides that the government
was justified in its acts and that its legislation is
in harmony with the constitution, a great and per-
haps inevitable change will have come about in
our concept of government.

Other Opinions

A WORD To TIIE FROSH
(The Carnegie Tartar)

Considering the abundance of advice that has been
given the freshmen during the last fmv days it is very
likely that by now they shall have cultivated an aversion
toward any more oI it.

Since too much of anything becomes tiresome, we
hesitate, for an instant, to add our bit to the large amount
of verbosity that has already been unloosed at them. Yet
there are three points that we cannot let pass unstressed
because they pertain to three major phases of college,—
the work, the faculty, and the life at college.

It is common for you freshmen to feel that you are
entering college to prepare for a career,7that career to
begin four years hence when you graduate. A more
proper attitude for you to take is that that professional
career begins right now. The process of specialization
has already begun.

You are here because you have a particular aptitude
or talent In a certain field. You may have excelled in it
III high school. Here it is much more difficult to excel.
The work is harder and the competition is kcener.
will discover that only when “your heart is in the work"
will you be able to make good. Beginning now, and even
more 50 four years Irom new, a condition will exist.
wherein only the fittest survive. This is the beginning
of your professional career and it behooves you to beone
of the ﬁttest if you intend to remain in it.

Cultivate a close relationship with your faculty. Con-
sider them more in the light of advisers rather than
teachers. You will find them always ready to sharpen
your interest, hear your ideas and consider your opinions

A great deal can be gotten from your teachers out
side the classroom. If you let them, they can be and
want to be your very close iriends. They are interested
in you and want in draw out the best that is in you.

Get into discussions with them, not only concerning your '

school work but also other things of Importance to you.
It will surprise you to find how closely your Interests lie.

hand across.

Your instructor .will give you a helping

At college you not only prepare tor the business of
earning a livlihood, you also prepare for the business of
living, There is a splendid opportunity at Carnegie for
you to acquire the subtle, elusive “technique of living”
because of the greatly diversified type of student here.

Although you have one prime interest, that particular-
study you are pursuing, don’t become specialized to the
extent that you disregard all other interests. If you are
an engineer, don’t neglect to read books or to cultivate
a taste for music, If you are an architect or an artist,
don't shun all things of a scientific nature, In other
words, increase your interests so that your mind becomes
more broadened and your cxistance becomes more round»
ed.

Learn to exchange viewpoints and take more than a
passing interest in what other people are thinking. Don't
allow yourself to become restricted to the narrow con»
tines of your ehiei pursuit. Concentrate on learning how
to enrich your life
