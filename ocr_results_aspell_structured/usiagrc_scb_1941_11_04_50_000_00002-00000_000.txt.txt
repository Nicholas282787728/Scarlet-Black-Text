. Friars Tutor.

With many student organizations on the
campus doing little more than electing of-
ficers, it is a pleasure to see one which is
working constructively toward a concrete
objective. The Men‘s Personnel board, form-
ed by the men’s personnel chairmen with
the help of the Friars, is working construc—
tively toward a concrete objective.

That concrete objective is to help stu-
dents adapt themselves to the scholastic
standards of Grinnell college.

The constructive steps this hoard has
already taken are to provide a quiet
place of study for those freshmen who
are having- difficulty and to begin work
on the organization of a tutorial system
to provin. ndividual and group instruc-
tion for those who most need it.

associations building,
brary, and Herrick chapel.

More than one faculty member has said
that the quality of scholarship so far this
year has been far below par. Whether this
condition is due to the difficulty of the
students and professors in adapting them—
selves to the four hour classes, to the fact
that professors are requiring more of their

'students, or to the fact that students are

not studying as much, the fact remains
that the Personnel board is taking definite
steps to improve the situation.

The Scarlet and Black commends
Friars and the Personnel board for their
progress thus far. Cooperation of [ac-
ulty and students should certainly be
forthcoming.

0 Homecoming, 194

The graduates have gone, the students have
settled down to work, and the facility, we
believe, has awakened to the fact that there
has been a Homecoming.

The celebration this year did not
measure up to Homecoming last year,
therefore leaving a slight feeling of
disappointment in the minds of many
students A little explaining is neces«
sary.

In the first place, Homecoming couldn’t
be as exciting as last year, for the cele-
bration in 1940 also marked the inaugura-
tion of President Stevens and a meeting
of the Board of Trustees

Second, the college made the mistake of
trying to compete with the University of
Iowa and the University of Minnesota on
Homecoming celebrations. Grinnell was on
an uneven footing there.

In the third place, the weather was bad.
Cold, rainy days never increased the influx
of alumni to any college

Fourth, a good number of those who
would be back were in the army. Uncle Sam
has claimed the services of a surprising
number of recent Grillnell graduates.

Last but not least, Saturday classes
probably held back some of the Home»
coming spirit. Certainly, the Homecom»
ing spirit never hit the campus until
the football game in the aftemoon.

The

30 Students Attend

Of Grinnell
Is Hoary 798

If all Grinnell were housed in one
building, that structure would be
798 years old.

That. ls how many years of ser-
vice have been accumulated by the
buildings now in active use for
academic, administrative, or hous-
ing facilities. -

Oldest buildings on campus are
the music hall, administration
building, and Blair hall, which
have all been in constant use
since their construction in 1882:
following the cyclone of that year.
The three buildings which then
constituted Grinnell college were
leveled by the storm, and all of
present-day Grinnrell has been
built since that time.

Goodnow hall, the mathematics
and physics building, has been in
use since the school year 1895-96.

Private home of Mary Grinnell
Mears, daughter of the founder of
the town, Mecrs cottage was built
in 1888. It has been used as a
women's residence since about
1900, according to L. v. Phelps,
treasurer, though no complete rec-
cm of its occupancy is available.
Phelps estimates Mears cottage
has been used by the college "at
least 35 years."

Last building dating from the
nineteenth century is the men's
gymnasium, completed in 1898.

The first decade or the twen-
tieth century was a period of
building activity for Gn‘nnell.
Three college buildings on Park
street were finished in 1906, the

Park street division of the campus
was completed in 1916 with the
erection of Alumni Recitation
hall.

Largest building enterprises of
Grinncll were the men’s and
women's dormitory systems, built.
during the World War I period.
Five cottages and the central

dining hall were completed and,-

with Mcars, formed the women’s
quadrangle in 1915. Three years
later the men's dormitory system
of six halls was completed. With
each of the Women’s cottages in
use 26 years and each men’s hall
23, the dormitory systems have
given 268 years of service to Grin-
nell. The Ward field grandstand
had been built in 1910, and nth»
lctic equipment was complete
wind the swimming pool built in
1917.

“Topsy" of tile Grimlell bulld~
ings is the heating plant, accord-
ing to Mr. phclps. In its picscnt
form it has been used since 1917,
but the original building on that
site was constructed before 1910.

Buckley Grants
Self Sabbatical

Recuperatmg from the ardors of
publication, William Buckley, ed—
itar of the Grinnell Zephyr, lo-
cal humor sheet, announced yes-
terday that he had granted him-
self a brief sabbatical.

“Plans for the third issue of
the Zephyr will not be formulat-
ed this Week,” he said. “I am
weary of it all.”

“You might quote me as saying
that it will be definitely a.Chrlst~
mas issue, and that the Zephyr
will give its usual appropriate
presents to a few lucky students
on the campus,"

“My staff,” Buckley admitted,
“has been mulling over the idea
of another survey. They toyed
with an inspection of Grinncll
'woltesses', but it was felt that
the subjectwould be too delicate.”
