The Grinnell campus Will wel-
come back the musical talents of the
ManhattanStringQuarterforacori—
cert on Saturday night, September
16, and Will initiate another year of
the Public Events Concertseries As
part of their twenty—fifth year of per—
formance, the Quarter is interpret~
ing works by Beethoven, Debussy
and Shosrakovich in their concert at
8:00 pm. in Herrick Chapel. and is
conducting a seminar with college
music students.

In the years from 1972 through
1975, the Manhattan Strings taught
and performed as the Quartet—in—
Residence here at Grinnell College
before embarking on their profes—
sional performance career. The mem—
bership of the group has experienced
some changes since then, leavmg
Eric Lewis as the only original mem«
ber of the Grinnelleeta Quartet.
Currently. the Manhattan attracts
attention as one of the country’s most
highly pmlsed chamber groups, and
has gained prize<winning recognition
for their recordings of the complete
cycle of Shostakovich string quare
recs. The performance of this twen«
tieth—century Socialist music is their
specialization and will be interpreted
at their concert.

ThemembersoflheSttingQuar»
tet will also conduct a master class
from 1:00—2:30 pm. on Saturday,
where they will work with students
from the College string ensembles.
After hearing presentations of music
from the students, the members will
provide suggestions and criticisms to
guide the students in their technique
and interpretation ofmusic. In addie

Something to Talk About
Scott’s Anderson’s view:

in a world of movies going back
to family values and happy endings,
it's good to watch a true ro life movie
like Something to Talk About, lulu
Roberts plays a woman who discovr
ers her husband, played by Dennls
Quaid, is having an affair. She leaves
him, much ro rlie chagrin of her
family. Set in asmall rown, everyone
is soon talking about rhe break—up.
The movie realistically depicrs rlie
pain behind a break/Lip. but also pro—

vides a reason for hope.

Credit the writer for a imaginar
rive script with Witty dialogue. Julia
Robert’s struggle to regain her iden-
tity and dignity after an embarrassing
and traumatic separation is blended
well with the story of the wayward
husband.

This is one of the best perfor—
mances Roberts has done in years.
She Convlncmgly portrays a woman
who has been wronged and is at—
tempting to put her life back [Ogetl‘r
er. Although she has been criticized

for being emotionless in movies like
I Love Trouble, her facial expres«
sions and voice make her pain and
determination real.

While Quaid plays a dilettante.
he also expresses a lack of substance
in his affairs. Quaid is a man who
loves his Wife but needed affection so
badly that when he lost his Wife‘s
intimacy, he began to look for other
women. Even though Quaid rells all
of this in a nicely rendered scene
with Roberts, she maintains her in«
dividualiry by not taking hiin back.

While the movie deals seriously
with a Woman’s quest for indepen-
dence, it is kept light hearted by two

“Something to

Talk About”

Scott:** *
Eleanor:**

Eleanor Dodson’s view:

Something to Talk About is the
second script from Callie Khouri,
who exploded lnro Hollywood with
her gender/bending action flick,
Thelma and Louise. Something ro
Talk About is also geared towards
female audiences, but at a much dif—
ferent level. lnstead of shootr‘emr
up, ball—busting fighters, now the
i‘ heroines are feisty housewives in the

Something to Talk About is
wellrcast in addition to being well—
acred. Julia Roberts and Dennis

and Ocna Rowlandssummon up digr
niiierl intensity as Roberts' parents,
caught in theirown marital turmoil.
Kym Sedgwlck offers some sass as
Roberts’ sister The cast is aided by
the skilled directing of Lasse Hall«
strom,aSwedishdirectorbestknown
for My Life as a Dog. His recreation
of this almost mythical Deep South
manages real authenticity beyond
accents and landmarks. His feel for
this Southern life, real or fictive,
pervades every frame of the film.
