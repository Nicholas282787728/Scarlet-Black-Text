EVENTS

the word “reprisals” to include aca-
demic reprisals, Leggett and Wall
told the negotiators that the ad-
ministration had no authority to in-
tertere with a faculty member’s
judgement. since the decision is one
between the student and histeacher.

However, Mr, Wall did agree to
talk to individual instructors and
that he would approve any requests
for extensions that were recom—
mended by the faculty member in»
volved.

Lawrence Wright told the SlrE
that CBS had asked that no acade»
mic reprisals be taken. He said
the administration agreed not to call
in civil authorities.

There were two versions of the
Black Manifesto composed during
the week. The second did not in-
clude the demand that a comm»
unity of two hundred blacks be es»
tablished, but it included a new de—
mand: “Black studentAfaculty re-
view boar .” Mr. Wall said that
CBS negotiators wanted this board
to deal with cases where blacks felt
they were being discriminiated 3g,
ainst by individual professors. The
administration argued that the aca»
demic standing committee was al»
ready set up and that there were
procedures of appeal through vari-
ous channels.

The SliB had reported indirectly
a statement made by President Leg»
gett that the discussions Monday mo»
ruing explained to the administration
”what some of the points of the
Manifesto really meant, stripped of
their rhetoric.” Deborah Wright
objected to this terminology and said
that the “explanation of the Maui—
festo was based on the rhetoric of
the text of the Manifesto,"

Lawrence Wright told the 53:5 that
the administration and the CBS ne»
gotiators hardly spoke during the
first half hour, while administra»
tors were discussint the Manifesto
and deciding what to do about the
library occupation. He disagreed
with Mr. Walker’s statement that
the demands of the Manifesto” were
modified with the first half hour
of discussions.” He said that only
one modification was made during
the first hour.

A negotiating sessiondid takeplace
Tuesday morning. The Spa had
incorrectly reported that no such
session took place.

in another article the 5&8 incor-
rectly stated that the full SGA ca-
binet would participate in the ne-
gotiations Wednesday afternoon. We
had been told they would at the time
we went to press. Only two re—
presentatives were in the afternoon
negotiations. Craig Kugasakl's
name was inadvertently ommitted
from a list of the members of the
SGA cabinet.

CBS Clarifies Positions To Students

Four informational meetings held
Tuesday night by CBS and SGA pro»
duced a clarification of the Black
Manifesto and a good deal of
discussion on the role of blacks at
Grinnell and the changes which they
see necessary at the institution. The
Loose meeting was chaired by Law»
rence Wright, the Main meeting by
Ernie Rose, the Younker meetingby
Merilyn Cubit, and the.I Cowles meet»
ing by Alan Wheat.

Clarify Demands

The meetings began withamember
of CBS clarifying the ten demands
comprising the Black Manifesto, The
changes and modifications were:

1. The figure of “200 representat-
ives taken from all walks of life
of Black people” had been dropped
Instead, CBS is asking the establish
ment at a Black Admissions Board,
consisting of three black members
of the faculty and staff. This Board
would review the files of all black
applicants whose applications would
normally be reviewed by the Ad»
missions Board.

2. It was made clear that this
demand, which involved a black re-
presentative on every Committee of
the college applied only to those
committes where students currently
have representation. However, it
was stipulated that there would be
a black representative called into
various committee meetings which
directly affect the black Community.

Mandated Spokesman

3. This demand is designed togive
the Administration a mandated re-
presentative who can speak for the
black community. This would end
the practive of “pulling a black
student in off the sidewalk and ask»
ing him for the feeling of the black
community on Some issue" which
was described by one CBS repre—
sentative.

4. This demand involves allowing
blacks, especially freshmen, to be
guaranteed the right to live with
other blacks if they so desire.
CBS members mentioned that this
year, some blacks got “stuck off
on South campus, away from the
majority of blacks.”

5. The black students feel that
S GA foods simply are not ful-
filling their needs because they
are so different from the foods
to which blacks are accustomed.
They noted, however, that the term
"soul food” had not been employ»
ed. (Apparently, this term comes
straight from certain portions ofthe
[own news media.)

 

6. The blacks feel that the curr-
ent financial aid program is not
meeting their needs. They think that
money that should be going for
black shcolarships is “disappear-
ing” when fewer black studentsthan
expected enroll,

'7. The Black Cultural Center is
presently housed in a bulldingwhich
has no room that will accomodate
more than 25 people. This leaves
nowhere for black organizations
such as CBS to hold meetings.Also,
what facilities there are inthe Black
Cultural Center are in poor re»
pair.

8. The black Students feel that
the presence of a Black Studies
major would be an inducement for
other black Students to enroll at
Grinnell. The lack of one, they feel,
is definitely driving potential stu-
dents away.

9. The black students want the
right to administer funds that at»
fect them and which they are, in
some cases, responsible for pro-
curing. One example cited was the
Martin - Luther King Scholarship
fund. Black students created the
fund, but have no real idea at pre-
sent about where the money from it
is going,

10. The Black Library would con»
sist of a special section of Hurling
containing books, slides, films, etc.
concerning black history, heritage
and culture. This area would beopen
to white as well as black students.

Questions Raised

~After the CBS moderator had com-
pleted his point by point explanation
oi the demands, the door was opened
for questions from the assembled
students. Below are paraphrases of
some questions and answers.

Q. Is there a history to these
demands?

A. Many of these same demands
were made several years ago by
black students and accepted by the
administration. Since then, noaction
has been taken. It is almost as if
the College is overlooking its Black
students.

9. Could you detine the term “sur»
Vival” as it is used in the Mani»
festo?

A. Survival refers to maintaining
our life style in the face of con-
tinued pressure by the white com-
munity to assimilate us into the
white culture.

0. Someone said the number 200
was dropped from your first demand.

is this true?

A. Yes. We realize thatthe college
has financial problems. What we
want, and can obtain with a Black
Admissions Board, is a more equi»
table system for admitting Blacks —
a good, fair system for processing
Black applicants.

o. Could you clarity the meaning of
the minority veto power?

A. AS it stands now,views ofblacks
are ottern overlooked by College
committees considering aspects of
Grinnell vital to blacks. The veto
power would give us the right to,
in effect, say STOP. What we want
would be the right to hold up the
meeting and the debision until the
effects on the Black community
of any particular action couid be
more fully explored.

Q, Dean Kimbo is a representat-
ive on every committee in the Com-
mittee A structure. Do you con-
sider this adequate black represen-
tation?

A. No. On many of those comm»
ittees, he must act for the entire
student body as Dean of Student
Affairs — and that is as it should
be. We want someone who will be
speaking only for the black com-
munity, We believe that it is a full
time job for anyone to inform him-
self as to the black community’s
wishes on the many items which are
decided.

Q. What would your financial aid
demand? Could you explain it fur»
ther?

A. The present financialaidboards
do not relate well to black needs.
We want financial aid for blacks
put into the hands of the Black
Admissions Board.

Q. If your negotiations with the
administration appear stymied, will
you call in outside help?

A. CBS has no contingency plansoi
any kind relating to such an action,
We have absolutely no intention of
calling in any outside help.

Joint Boards

Following the tour SGA/CBS meet-
ings in Loose, Main, Cowles, and
Younker, the Joint Board met in
South Lounge to assess the results
of the meeting and plan any further
Joint Board action.

The meeting received reportsfrom
the Joint Board members who had
chaired the four meetings. The re»
ports indicated that more than 400
students had attended the meetings» -
150 in Younker, 100 in Main, 100 in
Cowles, and 85 in Loose.

All tour meetings went smoothly
according to their chairmen, and all
four resulted in better communica-
tions between Whites and Blacks.
The meetings apparently resultedin
an increase in support for the CBS
demands, as was evidenced by the
signatures on the petitions oigen—

P1224 HUT

eral support which were circulated
at the meetings,

Discussions then turned to what
actions, it any, the Joint Board
should take regarding the negotia-
tions between CBS and the adminis-
tration, It was decided that support
for the Black demands was an indi»
vidual matter, and therefore no vote
was taken on whether or not a state-
ment of support should be issued.

lt was announced that two members
of the SGA Cabinet were represent-
ing son in the negotiations. Shelley
Floyd and Mario Bognanno repre-
setned SGA in the first meeting
where SGA observers were allowed.
There was a suggestion that Mario‘s
position should be rotated among the
members of the Cabinet.

After a long discussion on the mat-
ter, Phil Sasich moved that the Joint
Board should leave to the discretion
of the SGA cabinet who should repre»
sent them, His motion was passed.

More Meetings?

Several Joint Board members then
asked if CBS could hold moreinior—
mational meetings. Lawrence
Wright, CBS Kotoko Spokesman, in—
dicated that this was a possibility
if in the judgment of the CBS mem»
bership such meetings would be use-
ful and productive,

However, he emphasized that the
CBS leadership could not commit
CBS to a decision on this or any
other matter without first consults
ing the members of CBS.

Confusion

Some House presidents had ex-
pressed contusion over the petition
which many had signed the previous
night. The petition was turned over
to Shelley Floyd with an invitation
for any House President who wished
to remove his name to do so. At the
end of the meeting, no names had
been removed.

Sam Clemmons asked ifa quorum
was present at 11:40. Shelley Floyd
replied that she had just completed
a count, and that an exact quorum
was present. Clemmons then left
the meeting, effectively ending both
the quorum and the meeting.

CBS Disclaims
Recent Vandalism

Lawrence Wright told the 5113
Friday that CBS is in no way con-
nected with the acts of vandalism
that have occurred on campus dur-
ing the last week,

Such action is “against our poll»
cies at this point,” said Wright.
Transmitters from almostone hun»
dred telephones were stolen last
week, thus crippling communi-
cations on the campus. other acts
of vandalism included the theft of
the ropes from the nagpoles and
the writing of graffiti on many walls
around campus.
