Cadmus paints controversial
subjects with sensitivity

By Bill Thompson

WhileAmerica was on the verge
of a nation-wide controversy over
government censorship of the arts
and the rights of the individual, a
young New York artist named Paul
Cadmus painted The Fleet‘s Inl, a
satirical depiction of carousing
Navy sailors in the spirit of Bosch
and Hoganh.

The painting was to be included
inan exhibition of federally funded
artwork at theprestigious Corcoran
Gallery of Anin Washington, DC,
but after Navy ofﬁcials became of-
fended with Cadmus‘ choice of
subject matter, the Assistant Secre-
tary of the Navy removed the work
from the Gallery'swalls.

The story of The Fleet’s In!
became frontrpage news during
April 1934, and launched the arLiSr
Lie career of the talented Cadmus.
The painting disappeared from
public eyes until the early 1980’s,
when it was unearthed in a private

Paul Cadmus' controversial painting The F leel's In!

jor retrospective of Cadmus‘ work.
The painting is now the property of
the Naval Historical Center and is
one of 36 works by Paul Cadmus
now on display in the Print and
Drawing Study Room in Burling
Library.

The exhibition features work
spanning Cadmus‘ entire career,
from his early studies as an art
student to his most recent ﬁgure
drawings. Primarily an American
Scene painter from the 1930’s,
Cadmus has never followed 20th
cennlry art movements and instead
draws his inspiration from theartof
Michelangelo, Signorelli, and other
artists of the Italian Renaissance.

Critics and art historians have
often overlooked Cadmus since his
style and choice of subject matter
are far from mainstream. Few other
American artists have explored the
issue of male homosexuality with

Les Negresses Vertes - Les Negresses Vertes
Les Negresses Vertes is one of the most popular international
bands around. Their music can best be described as French Salsa.
The band has a large brass section which dominates most of their
songs. The French lyrics address serious topics such as racial
prejudice, domestic violence, and alcoholism. Best known in
Grinnell for the incredibly romantic love song entitled “L’Homme
deMarais" (Swamp Man), this album also contains the perfectpztrty
lune ‘Zobl la Mouehc” (Zobi the Fly) and the zany number "Les
Yeux de ton Pete" (Your Father‘s Eyeballs). Due to the grmtncss
ofthis debut album, Les Negresses Venes is the quick, simple, and
enjoyable way to slip into the international music scene.

Cadmus‘ degree of care and sensi-
tivity. Some of the finest works in
the exhibition are the lyrical figure
drawings of his companion I on
Anderson. While some viewers
may ﬁnd them radically different
from his crowded and chaotic de-
pictions of the 1930s, they are a
ﬁtting expression of his humanistic
beliefs.

For more than 65 years, Cadmus
has uscd his talents to explore that
which he ﬁnds both ugly and beau-
tiful in humanity. Satire is but one
device to express his loveofsoeiety
and hisdesire to improve itthrough
criticism.

Cadmus' exhibition runs through
April 30 and may be seen during
regular viewing hours.
