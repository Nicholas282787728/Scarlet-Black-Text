Grlnnell Institute.

The meeting of Grinnell Insti-
tute was called to order Wednes
olay evening by Brcsident Denni»
it is to be regretted that
the attendance was not larger as
the program was one of the best
given in Grinnell Institute (or
some time and merited a better
audience.

Tire ﬁrst number on the pro-
gram was a chapel talk by Parish,
on the subject, “Markham's Iii-
tcrpretaticn of Millet's Painting."
Mr. Parish took exception to Mr.
Marlrltam's interpretation on the
ground that Millet had a special
dislike lorlhe points which Mark-
ham has emphasized and he also
differed from Markham oil the
grounds that Mrllet while having
in mind a peasant “bowed with
the weight of centuries” yet he
did not consider him wrthout
hopes and griefs. Mr. Parish
took a decidedly optimistic view
of the case ill contrast to Mark
ham’s pessimistic point of view.

Mr. Davis then spoke extem-
poraiieously on the subject, “15
Our College 3 Democracy?”
maintaining that it was not based
on democratic principles.

The music of the evening was
furnished by Miss Cadwell, in a
manner which the society enjoyed
and showed their appreciation by
a hearty encore to which see re-
sporrded.

Mr'. Otis spot-e extemporan.
cously on the question, “Dewey
and his Return," dealing with his
subject in a ﬁtting manner.

Blackbuin then summarized the
news of the week in a concise
form. He was followed by Mr.
Ziegler, speaking cxtemporan»
eotlsly on ”Trusts,” touching on
some of their good points as well
as their harm.

The debate of the evening was
on the question. Resolved: That
laws should be passed prohibiting
trusts.

Mr. Knapp supported the af-
ﬁrnlatlvc,while Mr. Harris upheld
the negative of the question
The debate was summed up and
judged by Mr. Campbell, who
awarded the decision to the neg
ative.

With a critic's report by Layr
hourne, the program of the evens
ing was concluded.

Ellis.

Thc program of Ellis for Friday
afternoon was in the form of an ex-
teinporaneous contest. in many
ways this contest was the best one
ever held by the society. All the
spe‘nlcersspokc exceptionally well,
and each one sliowcrl interest and
knowledge of the subject handled.

Miss Vesta Atkinson opened
the program with a very beautiful
vocal solo, wlllch was lollowed by
roll-calll. The ﬁrst speakei, Miss
Li an Smitll, had taken for her
subject, “The Czar’s Conference.”
Sherlold of the peace negotiations
being arranged at the present
meeting and the advantages it
would afford to all the nations if
carried out. Miss Helen Thom»
son played a very pretty piano
solo, which was much appreciated
by all. Miss Gertrude swauev
gave a very interesting talk on the
aitist, “Millet." telling of his life
and principal paintings.

“The Curse in Education" was
wellrtreated by Miss Anna Field,
and Mrs. Anna Moody spoke on
the subject, “Aid for College Stii»
dents."

In her talk on the "Initiative and
Referendum,” Miss Susie Ol‘VIS
treated the growth from town,
county and statetoiiationalgrowth
in the use of these measures. and
also spoke of its use and success-
ful practice iii Switzerland.

Perhaps the best talk of the at»
tcltltiun was rnade by Miss Mary
Ii Tate, on the subject “Our Pub-
lic School System." She pied for
higher education in languages, tor
an earnest endeavor to bring the
pupils more totich with the
practical things iii life, which may
best be accomplished by a more
complete study of the practical
branches ot stltdy#economics,
physrcs and civil government, and
so present to them the social needs
of the present day and hour.

The last speaker, Miss Gretta
Staiiett, spoke on "Colonial Sysr
tent vs. Monroe Doctrine." The
speaker rather favored the colo-
nial system, and used exceedingly
wellrchosen words for her talk.

Mrs. Simmons, Miss Rew alid
Miss Rand acted as judges of the
contest, and the ﬁrst place wasgiv»
en to Mary E. Tate, the second to
Susie Orvis. and to Lilian Smith
the third.
