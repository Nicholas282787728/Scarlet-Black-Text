FOOTBALL TEAM WORKING HARD

Under Conch Tratt's instruction Much
Progress is Made.

The condition of the men who
wclit t0 Marslialltown today to
play in the ﬁrst game of the seas
on was gratifying. While the team
is in nothing like the shape it will
be in later in the season, it has
been making wondertul progress
the last week. As last year the
'Varsity plays better on offensive
than in detensive play. A light
line makes defensive work more
difﬁcult, while in offensive plny
speed and pcrtcct interference
make up somewhat inr- this lack
of weight,

Coach Tratt takes advantage of
every pound of weight that he has
on the team. In running InterlErr
crice he puts in every available
man, even sending the quarter
ahead of the ball contrary to the
system oflast year. As soon as
the men get the plays down well,
the runner will have interference
that will be very diﬁcult to break
through.

The members of the squad who
went to Morshalltown tartlay as
the ’Varsity are most of them
showing up well. Baggs at guard
and center plays like a veteran
and ﬁlls his position very satisfaCr
torily. Collins at guard plays
good football and is a valuable
new man but has some bad habits,
such as getting off side. McKeag
and VanDike are playing a steady
game, while Evans at end is doing
well in a new position.

Behind the line Fisk plays quilts
ter as last year, acool, steady, sate
game. The halves this ycarare
speedy. Evan Evans is getting
off with the ball with remarkable
swtftness for a new man. Welker.
our hundred and torty pounder. is
playing his usual ﬁerce game.

At lull back the team is not so

strong as at this time last year.
New men are playing the position.
One of the weak points of the team
may be its puiiting. No very
strong punters have been discovs
ered as yet and Captain Fisk may
have to do the kicking.

To day's game will show both
our strong and weak points and
give a good chance to strengthen

both.

CONSERVATORY NOTES.

Professor Smith, instructor in
piano. will have charge of the

Glee Club.

The prospects tor a good Or-
chestra are very bright. The
regular practice will begin as
soon theroomsnreiighied,and
will be under the direction of
Prulcssor Mntlack.

A course in public school music
will lac given during the second
semester. Tlii is designed to
meet the needs, both oi profess
sionzll teachers, and those who are
required to teach music in the
common schools.

Improvements in the the Con-
servatory rooms are still being
made. Electric lights are to be
put in. and the rooms made Sulls
able for use at night. This ivill
be of specml advantage to the
Glee Club and Orchestra.

The choir of the Congregational
church at its meeting Thursday
evening decided to change the
time of rehearsal from 8:30 Thurs-
day eveningto 5:45 Saturday evenr
mg. The object ot the changers
to bring the rehearsal as near Suri-
duy as possible and at the same
time to avoid breaking up the
evening. A committee was ap
pointed to provide tortlie enlarge-
ment of the choir by the addition
ot new members. A very slmple
examination in sight reading will
be the basis of admission, and all
persons who enjoy singing are
cordially invited to try for the
choir. The time and place of the
examination will be found among
the notices on the second page.
