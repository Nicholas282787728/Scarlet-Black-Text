 

How did Grinnell end up under budget and
how did it fix it? Here's how they did it in
the 200072001 ﬁscal year.

A significant downturn in unrestricted giv-
ing was covered using money from the en
dowineni.

Expenses

The losses in these three areas were
covered by small grains spread across the
entire budget.

Dmmg services overspent its budget by
$196,000; an unexpected $53,000 in added
revenue reduced the deficit to $143,000.
health insurance

budgeted: $1.661M

spent: $1.977M

Health insurance was expanded to make it
cheaper for employees to cover their fami
lies, and the college spent an additional
$316,208 on premiums.

Heating hills
budgeted: $1.2m

heating bills spiked dramatically during last

Faculty salaries and financial aid are the two biggest

a possible financial crunch.

downturn, but maintain that

Although all budget ﬁgures
for next year arc rcnrarivc,
Osgood said he would push for
an increase in faculty salaries of
at least 5.25 percent. ”If we

percent.

“1 think it’s important in recruiting and retaining foo

Financial pressures on the college could comc from two

the suspicious absence of con.

With limited supplies, the
students set out to build Polish

a sign identifying it They
couldnt attord tools, so they did
much of the work with a Swiss

Polish House was con-
structed to to fill in the gap
between Germany and Russia,
said German House resident
Mailc Walker ‘02, one ofrhcsrudems responsible for build-
ing it.

Cocmnstructcr Michael Wells ’03 said the house was
built to "bring attention to Poland."

”[The house is] an artistic
representation or allegory
for the position of Poland In
between Germany and
Russia [that] also serves as
an allegory for the lack of

the house as “an artistic representation or allegory for the

also serves as an allegory for the lack ofartenuon [Central

Objections have come from many
directions. Facilities Management has
complained because there are rules

All Rhodes
lead to
Oxford

Kendra Young ‘02
wins prestigious prize

b y J u | i e D o n a
Staff Writer

Last Saturday evening, Griunell scnior
Kendra Young split a $150 drinit tab with
three other Rhodes scholars in a Houston
bar. The sixtccn ﬁnalists from the Seventh
Division of the Rhodes competition had
made a pact: after the final decision came
out, the four winncis had to take out the
twelve ninnencup and get rhom smashed.
Arid Young was one of the four. Unforcue
narciy, shc was out forty huclts; on the other
hand, she won one ofthe most prestigious
fellowships granted to American under»
graduates.

Young, ii biology mayor with a global
dcvclopmcnr studies concentration, is rhc
first Giinncllinii to win the Rhodes in a
decade, and she is the second Grinnell
woman to win. ever.

In October ancxt year, she will d:pan
for Oxford Univcrsity in England to study
for a second BA. in human sciences, a dis-
cipline that she describes as “a marriage
between human ecology and public health."
Thcsc years will further prepare Young for
her major hit ambition of public health
woik

The Rhodes scholarship was actually
the last thing rhar Young expected to win.
Now that rhc shocit is beginning to wear
off, she is bcginning to get excited about
the next few ycars From what she knows
about Oxford, Young believes she will be
academically challenged and will mtet a
variety ofinreresir. ngopio, becauscofhow
university admissions arc sent up, there is
a great deal ofdiversity in the students, and
the University itsclf is vnuriy diffcrcnr from
Griniicll—lrugc, urban, and European.

This achievement has come after :i so—
mcsrcr ofworit on rhc Rhodes application
and preparation for die interviews, as well
as an undergraduate career that has been
particularly focused on health care. Duo
ing Grinncll’s breaks, she has worked as a
paramedic in Bolivia and in a hospital in
Costa Rica; last semester shc organized a
symposium on health mrc.

The last scmotcr has been particularly
grueling, since Young was preparing an ap.
plication for the Watson Fellowship and
medical school applications, in addition to
rhc Rhodes, in preparation for her intcre
views, Doug Cutchins, director nfthe Ofc
tic: for Social Commitment, arranged for
Young to speak with various professors and
community leaders about current domes-
tic and international issues. For instinct,
she recalls meeting with Todd Armstrong,
Russian. from Montana, the state through
which slrc was applying for thc Rhodes, who
helped her brush up on Montana history
as well as European politiﬁt
