Survey finds
EPCS vary

. ,by Mark Mayer

Editor's note: In early April, the
SGA and the 5&1} agreed to
jointly conduct a survey or present
Educational Policy Committee
iEPct members. The purpose of
the survey was to ﬁnd out. irom the
student EPC members. how they
viewed the EPC system: what
problems they felt existed and how
these could he corrected

A total of 54 interviews were
conducted with EPC liiembers
ii-oni all departments. Eiiorts were
made to interview at least three

' C members from each
on artment. Therefore, it Should
be noted that the results are a
reflection of the opinions of those
EPC members interviewed. not of

-PC members. The following is
a bi-iet analysis or some of our
findings:

Almost all EPC members in
terviewed said that they were
allowed to participate in all
departmental decisions, including
faculty hiring Most also said that
they felt the iaculty was willing to
cooperate with them and that their
EPC had a voice in the way the
department was run, though otten
in an undefined, informal
' acity. This seemed to be most

alent in the smaller depart
ments.

Anthropology EPC member
Naomi Farber explained that the

hropology faculty has been
“ e'ry open , . , and supportive of
the EPC.” And German EPC
member Jan Lussmeyer said of the
German iaculty, “They’re very
cooperative. . . they really support
the EPC ” Similar statements
were voiced by EPC members

 

irom the following departments:
art, English, math, biology,
American Studies, theatre,
religious studies, political science,
Russian, physics, philosophy, and
sociology.

There were a few departments,
however, in which student EPC
members ielt that lacuity
cooperation was lacking.

All three history EPC members
interviewed were dissatisfied with
the extent to which the history
tacuity had been willing to include
the EPC in departmental
decisions EPC member Dave
Clottelter said that the iaculty
members do not cooperate because
”they are not willing to sacrifice
power " And Sally Snapp, another
history EPC member, noted that
the history faculty “is not talking
with the EPC" She said their
“mystique of protessionalism
was “intimidating."

Members of the Spanish EPC
also voiced their dissatisfaction
with the lack or cooperation they
have received irom the Spanish
iaculty. Spanish EPC member
Laurie Rothenberg said that While
the iaculty “always asks the EPC’s
opinion . . , the professors do not
take seriously the role of the
EPC." She went on to explain that
when the EPC’S opinion diffels
from that of the faculty, the EPC'S
opinion is consistently disregarr
ded.

French EPC member Ted
Grippo said that “this year there
were no EPC contributions." He
continued, “The French faculty
never asked us to do anything." He
added, however, that due to the

DiBllO and Paltzer—scholars from

by Debbie Weiner

Rick DlEello and Tom Paltzer
are not your typical, sheltered,
naive, inexperienced college
students. For one thing, they are 27
and 26 years old, respectively. For
another, both came to Grinnell
alter serving in.the us, Navy.
They are two of tour veterans on
rampus. Both are Seniors whose

ircuitous routes to Grinnell have

taken them through Hawaii, San
Diego, the Pentagon, Denver, and
Norfolk, Virginia.

Rick joined the Navy at age 18,
and was in the service from 1960 to
1974.116 \ventthrough boot camp in
San Diego, and irom there went on
to Norfolk, where he was trained in
communications. He was then sent
to Washington, to work in the Chief
of Naval Operations (CNO)
communications center. He
worked with computers and
message editing.

One problem with the Navy is
that you must go wherever they
send you. Rick hoped to be sent
somewhere on the West Coast, so
he could be near his home in
Hawaii. Instead, he was deposited
4200 miles away. When he received
his orders from Norfolk to go to
D.C., he smashed his fist into a
locker in frustration, shattering his

ring. But he had some interesting
experiences on the East Coast,
which at the time was going
through the turmoil of protest
caused by the Viet Nam War.

He recalls walking down the
streets of Washington with a friend
one day in June, 1968 when sud
denly their faces started burning
and their eyes started tearing. it
reminded Rick of an experience in
boot camp, when me recruits were
required to be exposed to tear gas.
He was right; it was tear gas, and
soon a policeman cleared them out
of the area. It was the time of
Resurrection City, and Rick and
his friend had walked into a con-
frontation between police and
protesters,

In 1970, 100,000 protesters filled
Washington to demonstrate
against Hie bombing of Cambodia.
The Pentagon halls Rich walked
through every day were lined with
armed troops in full combat gear,
Security was tight, but once when a
friend had forgotten his Pentagon
pass he found it ridiculously easy
to enter the building. He flashed
the guards his University of
Tennessee ID. card, which looks

 

something like a Pentagon pass.
But in other cases, military guards
took every premution. He recalls

SGAi
Changes
passed

by Peter Levy

Three new amendments to the
SGA constitution were ratified in
an all~campus relerendum and the
1977-78 budget was approved at a
Joint Boards meeting Wednesday.

All of the SGA budget was ac
cepted as presented except for
changes caused by three amend
ments. .

Aside from the amendments, a
considerable amount of discussion
dealt with a recommendation by
the Counseling Committee and the
Social Policies and Regulations

Committee that SGA prohibit the’
allocation of funds for all campus
parties where beverages with an
alcohol content higher than 18 per
cent be served. This ape,
pears to indicate that the con-
sumption of alcohol is becoming a
major problem at Grinnell. One
committee member, referring to a
Bite report, stated that several
thousand dollars_of damage to
college property has come ,on
weekends when hard liquor is
served at all»campus parties. The
intent of the committees’
recommendation is to make the
student body more aware and
more responsible concerning
alcoholic drinking.

One of the amendments to the
budget followed a similar line of
thinking. It was meant to en-
courage activities which do not
include alcoholic consumption. The
proposal asked that $500 from
other budgetary allotment57$300

that some American University
Students were almost shot at when
they attempted to sneak in to the
Naval SecurityStation as part of
their fraternity initiation

Rick liked his jobs in the Navy,
although the rigid organization
was irustrating, He added that the
officers at CNO considered their
subordinates to be brainless. He
found some release in rather
disreputable behavior: every once
in a while, he and two other men
would skip down the halls of the
Pentagon, their arms linked.
Needless to say, they received
some strange looks.

In 1972, his wish to be located
close to home was fulfilled when he
was transferred to Hawaii to work
in the Intelligence Division of the
Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet
(CINCPACFLT). Here he served
as a briefer and ran an ad-
ministrative office.

Alter getting out of the Navy in
1974, Rick worked as a
gravedigger, among other oc-
cupations, before coming to
Grinnell. He was attracted here
because he found Grinnell a
“personable institution,” and he

 

wanted to go to a small school.
Rick had few problems adiusting
