Last Tuesday, an iniormatronal and
organizational meeting was held in
ARH lor the “Ted Kenneday presiden-
tial campaign.” Matt Wanning, chain
man of the Des Moines based Commit-
tee for Alternatives, which is attemp»
ting to unity the prerKennedy move-
ment throughout Iowa, was the

speaker.

Even though held on Skip Day, over
as students attended the meeting,
which was scheduled by Democratic
Activities Organizer Emily Silliman.

“Even though Kennedy has not an»
nounced his candidacy. indications are
that he will run if the first primaries
and caucuses show a dissatisfaction
with Carter,” stated Silliman.

Iowa is an important state 101‘
presidential hopefuls since it holds
caucuses before any other state holds
a caucus or primary. Because of the
caucus system, it is necessary to hav
an effective statewide organizationq

Warming laid out a basic campaign
strategy tor the Kennedy movement.
He emphasized making contact with '
the people, and also hoped that stu-
dent rallies would become an intregal‘
part of the campaign. He stated,
“There is a resurgence of campus
political activity in luwa, and Ken-
nedy's probable candidacy is the
motivating force."

Kennedy cannot make any “official”
stands on issues. since he? not actual-
ly in the race. Wanning doesn't feel
that this is a hindrance and slatesv
“The fact that Kennedy is an effective
senator indicates that he could also be
a directive, and thus strong. presi~

dent.”
The Kennedy “campaign" has thus

far been funded totally by individuals;
however. Wannlng is confident unions
and other organizations will contribute
as Kennedy’s candidacy becomes
more obvious.

Kennedy has a long history of in-

received his LLB degree form the
University of Virginia in 1953.
Kennedy’s first major political or-
iice was assistant district attorney at
Sullolk County, which he held fur two
years. He was first elected to the
Senate in 1962 and is now one of the
most influential senators in
Washington, and the chairman of

several committees.

It should be pointed out, however,
that this “presidential campaign”
could prove to be quite interesting.
Since Kennedy has not declared
himself a candidate, it could be the
first presidential campaign without an
official candidate.
