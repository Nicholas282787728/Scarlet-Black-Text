L'Ehitariui

HE prestige of victories is {Ill with
Grinnell. Nerer have we downs
ed the Scarlet and Black in (l. football
gamc, though tlic games have always
been close and hard iougho. Three
years ago, when our champion eleven
Went down to Grinnell Conﬁdent of
bringing home the victory, they were
defeated ll to 5, In 1903, the game
on our grounds was a licarriending
Contest, of which Grinnell was the
victor by a score at 15 to 10. Last roll
at Grinnell in agameol unusual ﬁerce-
ness neither side was able to bring
away an actual victory, though Cor-
nellians looked upon the score of 5 Lo 5
35d virtual triumph for the Purple
and White. Remembering our dis~
w'uragingibut never disgincciul—
deteats of past years, the Cornell learn
will go into the game next Saturday
determined L0 uphold the honor of the
Purple and White, and all loyal sons
andidauglirerso: Cornell must. be there
to stand back at them to the very
end Let our slogan be: Grinnell
must be defeated. And whatever the
loutcome, lob us never quit.

The above extract from a. column
and (L half editorial in this week's
Cm‘lmllitlii shows the elicits which are
being made at Mt. Vernon to arouse
enthusiasm forSaturdhy’s game. This
season has been particularly disastrous
for the Cornell team but ashas been
said many times before, comparative
scores are of no value, so iar as iortelle
ing the result is concerned. It is well
for the members of the Grinnell squad
to remember that the contest with
Cornell will be no easy one. The
Methodists have never beaten the
Scar-lot and Black teams but they have
come so close io it and have made
things so uncomfortable or tiiiies,tlitit
wchnd no points to spare. It is not
probable that the Methodists will (le-
ieat us butibis entirely possible. A

A Few Remarks;

Wise and Otherwise.
By the Ediior

”Grinnell must he deieated,n so says
the Coriicllian. We hare heard our
Methodist brethren make that same
statement beloie but as yet it has al-
ways been an idle threat.

Amos claimed last heel: than they
were beaten or Nebraska by accnter
and aquarrerbnck. Problem: it two
men could beat the Farmers by uscore
0:21 to 0, what would have been the
score with ii men in the game?

We would recommend to the presi-
dentoi' the Stale Library Association
that the Captain or Cu. K be request-
ed to station a guard at every door
and in the halls of the Carnegie Lib-
rary. This would relieve the librai-
ianirom police duty and clielaconio
demand to “Move on” and “Do not
congregate in the halls." would be
more readily obeyed ii backed up by a
show ofiorce. A ouxmiu lecture and
aim innocus immed upon the nail
might also help some.

The Carletonia remarks that liai-
lbwccn came and went. We have
heard it said chatarew rejoiced at
its coming but the great majority

The Badgers chased the Gophers in.
to their holes recently but the letter
refused to pull their holes in after
them, Now the Wolverines are won
dering whose turn it will hate take
to the tall timber next Saturday,

The Drake Dclphic insists that Ber-
nie Hamilton used to be a. iarorite
athlete oithe blue and white. Per
haps he was, as Drake has always had
a wholesome respect icr our athletes
but nevertheless when he made the
the present state record in the broad
jump, he wore the inaltese cross of
old Grinnell.
