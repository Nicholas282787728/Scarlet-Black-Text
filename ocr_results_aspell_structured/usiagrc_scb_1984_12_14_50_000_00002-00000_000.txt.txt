Editorial:

Keep

the “Real” debate
in the light

Despite the joint bumblings of two students and the
editors of “The Outcry,” the real issue at hand concern-
ing the deadly racism in South Africa and Grinnell’s rela-

tion to It

. will remain in the light for now, and at least

until the end of next semester: This week, as President
Reagan said that, while America deplores the system of

racial apartheid in South

Africa, his administration

would not change this country’s economic policies
towards that country; a country where it is illegal for
most people, black, brown and white, to answer negative
1y to any question of their feelings concerning Apartheid,
While Reagan was meeting with Nobel Peace Prize wins
ner and black South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, at
least nine U.S. Congressmen were arrested outside the
South African Consolate in Washington DC, while pro»
testing that country’s system of “economics."
There’s still time for Grinnell to divest.

Letters to the editor

Olsher’s
Idealism is
challanged

To the Editor:

(re: Cindy olshcr's comnienn
tary. “Reason lor Tests, Finals,
and Papers-"i. 1 disagree with
olsher's assertion that our system
at college education needs radical
overhauling li.e. abolish all ex-
ams. papers. projects. etc i

Grades are a measurement bl
potential and learning ability, An
employer knows that someone
who has periornied well on college
exams. projects and papers ulll
probably do well on any given
assignment. Furthermore. Just
because one has to work to learn
ti.e. study [or a test or struggle
with a paperi. it doesn‘t mean
that this has somehow cancelled
the knowleged acquired.

But, tor the sake oi argument
concerning Olsher‘s solution to
"the iundmental problem." let's
assume that we do need a change.
Her solution: boycott all tests and
papers and instead be evaluated
through discussion or conierence.
What i want to know is why she
thinks students vian‘t study and
cram beiore these conferences.
How is this essentially diil’erent
irom the existing system?

And. even il it were diit’erent.
how could a physics prol‘essor
possibly have lime to discuss in
detail the iundamenials oi physics
with every single one oi her/his
students? How could any pro-

lessor. tor that matter. conducl
enough conierences lo tormulatc
an accurate evalution til the stu-
dents learning (as measured by
the student‘s skills)? This Is a
senseless proposition. but it goes
well with the original argument
(it one overlooks their logical ln-
compalability ).

In support 01 idealism. 1 do ad-
mire olshers apparent line or
learning. Yet l uni coniused as to
why she pays Month; tor this
education. After all. [or her pur-
poses, she could get nearly the
same education tor the price oi
certain text hooks and all the at-
tention she'd be willing to give her
subjects 01 interest. 7 Frank

answers to, error

To the Editor:

Last week‘s Faced)“ In 1]“-
outcry presented a blatant
misrepresentation ol the vievis oi
Students to End Apartheid

First. Ethan Cohen has never
been to a Students to End Apar»
lheid meeting. viliich means he
could hardly have been represen-
ting our views. 'l‘l‘ue. he presented
iour lacts about black South
Alricans‘ luelings about "ch7
structive engagement" as well as
an indirect mention of the cum
sidcrable restrictions placed on
all South Africans ioi- speaking
against apartheid.

Unfortunately those iacts made
up only the iirst hall oi article; the
second hall being made up of reg-
gae/rasiaiarian propaganda.
which has little to do with the
issue of divestment at Grinnell.
Such comments. in tact. make a
