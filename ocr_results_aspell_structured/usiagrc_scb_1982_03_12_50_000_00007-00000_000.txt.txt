Pioneers make waves in conference meet
year

Grinnell gains the title for the fourth straight

by Jeff Raymond

Few people on campus would associate
Grinnell College with athletic dominance,
yet there is an awesome dynasty right
under our noses and almost nobody knows
about it. For the fourth straight year Coach
Ray Obermiller‘s Pioneer men's swim
team has captured the Midwest Conference
crown, The Pioneers garnered 473 points
and outdistanced their closest competitor
Charleton by 149 points.

The swimmers have been so thorough
that they have won the conference meet by
about 900 points over their four years as
Champions. Said ObermiIIer in an
understated manner, “It's been a pleasant
four years. "

Grinnell placed winners in only five of the
18 events at the meet at Beloit College but
superior depth on the team produced
placers in all events. This consistency has
been a trademark of Pioneer swim teams
and has been the key to the team's annual
success story. Determination and pride in
past accomplishments charge ule swim-
mers and they responded as usual in this
year’s conference meet by performing
beyond even the expectations of Oberr
miller. “Exceptional" was the term he usV
ed to describe the efforts of the team
members at the meet.

The Beloit pool posed many problems for
the Pioneers, who are used to the com~
parative luxury afforded them by the PEG
pool. Aside from the uncomfortably narrow
lanes in the Beloil facility, there was poor
lighting in the pool and choppy water rocks
ed the swimmers, especially in the shallow
end. Obermiller had turned off the lights in
the PEG pool during practice for a week
prior to the meet to help get the swimmers
acclimated to the conditions in Beloit but
the waves in the pool were apparently more
troublesome than anyone had counted on,
Overall, though, obermiller thought that
the team did very well and stated, “We

couldn’t have done much of a better job."
In fact, the Pioneers finished the first day
of competition five points behind Carleton
but swam well enough on the second day to
take a lead of 100 points and had enough
momentum to furmer increase their lead
on the final day,

The cornerstone of the team‘s success at
the conference meet is the group of seniors
on the team, The squad will lose six per
formers to graduation this spring and will
be hard pressed to replace the talent that
the six represent, Phil Knaff, Warren
Schultz, Rick Stuck, Steve MacFarlane,
Kirby Schaufler and Brian Ross were
freshmen on the team lhat began the con-
ference streak in 1979. Even though the
team still has a good deal of sophomore
talent returning and a few committed high
schoolers, Obermiller said that he has his
work cutout for him in rebuilding a strong
team

Ross has been a customary fixture on the
winner's stand and a team leader during
his career at Grinnell, He has captured ten
individual titles and swam on seven relay
teams in his four conference meets.
Despite missing training during the first
semester this year because of foreign
studies, Ross came back and was able to
prepare well enough to win and set con
ference records in two individual races and
compete on all three winning relay teams,
Ross thought that he could have done even
better in a better pool and said of his times.
“I got lucky.” Stated Obermiller, “I franks
Iy don’t believe he swam as well as he did."

Next Thursday Ross and teammate John
Gerry, a diver, will be in Virginia to come
pete in the Division III nationals While
there may be some problems involved
because of midsemester exams, Oberr
miller said that the Office of Academic Ad-
vising, of which he is the director, would try
to work out suitable arrangements for tests

Women’s Track

closing the indoor segment of the came
paign with its iourth straight victory, the
Grinnell women's track team captured a
triangular in Chicago last Saturday night.
Coach Evelyn Freeman's Pioneers used
their superior depth to outpoint the Univerr
sity of Chicago 62754 for first place Mona
mouth was third with 13 tallies. “It was
good to continue our winning streak,"
Freeman said. “But the late hour at which
the meet started plus the rapid pace at
which the events were run made it hard to
sustain performances."

Pioners copped five events. Jean Harker
took the 60-meter hurdles in 10.8, Julie
Schellhorn the sob—meter run in 2:34 Ana
drea straight the loco-meter run in
