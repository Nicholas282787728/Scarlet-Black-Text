clothe thought and argument in
an ettective garb. or has each
ot our teams simply happened in
each case to meet a better team?
Somewhere, at any rate. the cause
can be found. Persistent effort
will ﬁnd it. One very good trait
in Grinnell's character will here
come to the frontkwe do not
easily become discouraged. We
will continue to debate. Prepara»
tions are already in progress tor
the preliminary debates from
which our next year's team will
be picked. such insistent work.
if continued, will surely weed out
the imperiections in our system.
and just as surely bear iruits irom
our labor.

 

QEbitoriut

EFEATED againl In ﬁve
consecutive intercollegiate
debates now. Grinnell has met .de-
feat. No slur can be cast upon
Grinn‘ell's representatives in any
of these contests. On the con
trary they deserve praise for their
efforts. No team worked more
conscientiously than the one we
sent to Topeka last Thursday
night. They did their best in
preparation and on the plattorm.
But. nevertheless, another defeat!
Why is it? Is the standard at
general intelligence higher in
other colleges than in Grinnell?
That hardly seems probable. Do
other college representatives work
harder than ours? That. too.
seems improbable, although such
may be the case owing to greater
freedom allowed from classroom
work during the time of prepara-
tion, and, owing also, to the ex~
tended studies other collegiate
debaters are permitted to make in
larger libraries. Has the orator-
ical facilities, which many other
colleges possess and in which
Grinnell is entirely lacking. any-
thing to do with the latter's con-
tinued defeats?
has. tor eloquence and easy bear-
ing on the platiorm. which cone
tinued training gives. can not but

EVERAL students of Iowa
College have lately rec
celved circulars from a ﬁrm which
offers to furnish all kinds of liters
ary productions at prices ranging
from ﬁfty cents to thirty dollars.
This ﬁrm is only one of many and
circulars of this kind come to the
student at irregular intervals.
Such a business cannot be too
severely dealt with and the best
thing to do with such communica
tions is to cast them into the ﬁre
at once. The ﬁrm encourages the
honesty and the student making
use of their productions is dishon-
est. A few glaring examples of
plagiarism and its evil results have
appeared in college circles this
year. This ﬁrm makes a long step
toward plagiarism possible and
easy, it indeed the use ot their
work does not strictly come under
that head.
