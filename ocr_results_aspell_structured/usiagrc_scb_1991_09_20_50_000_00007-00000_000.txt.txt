The bottom line is, you don’t see the

Obviously, there‘s a rude crew of
folks out there getting away with it.

Somewhere where it‘s warm and

a crowd of ex»academics sitting
around, maybe grilling up some

steaks, drinking a few cold ones, and
randomly quoting the lyric poetry of
Petrarch. “'My ship laden with for,

degree?" goes the conversation. The
replies are varied--“UNLV."
“Harvard.” “Dartmouth." "UNLV,"
“Indiana University" “Miami."
“Penn State." “UNLV.” And then, as
a group, these rebels all burst into
cheers, slap hands, and do a big toast,
yelling, “WAND WE ALL WENT

the post ofﬁce. Now unlike many

thought this a shocking breach of

almost four years here, I have read

Many have argued that certain Neo»

advocated allowing them to hang by

with the distribution of this particular
issue of the American Conservative,

of this publication which speaks about

My mouth hung open. These sup-
posed “Conservatives," whose ideo-

Grinnell ofbeing a den ofhypocrisy,
dismissing the charge of obstruction

The Constitution of the United

Mr. North WAS a part bore he so

DINOSAUR DAYS
Rape: Questions
without answers

“It wasn‘tthe ﬁrst time,“ L. said to
me as we sat outside her house last
April. She’d returned from Arizona
early, choosing to ﬁnish the semester
at a state university near home. After
beingraped by 10, l2 or 15 fraternity
brothers. she didn‘t feel like staying.

The number is vague because they
were beating her, calling the 19 year-
olddaughterofmyfaﬂter'sbestfriend
a slut and a whore. L. cried when she
told me about it. She used the expres-
sion “taking advantage of me“ and
described the ﬁrst. time that it had
happened. Four years ago she’ddated

seat of his car. It was over by then.
Although they wereboth drinking, L.
is sure thatherdrink had beendrugged.

The man never had‘to stand up in
courtanddefend himself. She did not
tell anyone. The sheer violence of the
attack in Arizona left L. devastated,
however. Her mother ﬂew outtobring

not to prosecute.

In her ﬁrst year of college, L. slept
with quite a few men, She ﬂirted.
Perhaps she drank too much at par-
ties. Cenainly she was not sober that
one night when a dozen fraternity
brothers shoved her onto the floor
and held her there.

This and more would be brought
out at a trial. If she won, the rapists
might spend a few years behind bars
L.‘s reputation would bepoor at best
People tend to blame the survivor
when she is not the perfect lily-white
good girl. What sort of world do we
live in that women ought to expect
rape attheend of aﬂirtatious evening?
I have a problem with the mixed mes
sages that we receive. When alcohol

is involved, the realm of responsr
ity becomes as controversial as it rs
contradictory.

This summer’s media blitz on the
accusation of William Kennedy Smith
comes to mind immediately. Many
people wondered how stupid that
woman was to go home with Smith

to say thatI am no exception “What
did she expect?” I asked my momert
There is so much attention to the idea
that a woman needs Lobe more aware
of her actions. What does this mean
and is it appropriate? Does it lend
itself to the concept that an intoxi-
cated woman who goes home with a
man should take responsibility for
getting into that situation and accept
thata man might “take advantage" of
her? The messages which society
gives us do not help me in any way to
clarify this issue of responsibility

Of course, things are notblackand

of the conﬂicting images to which we
are all exposed.

“It isn’t fair. She’s so young, A
virgin.. .before those animals," she
sobbed to me when I visited a few
months later. Now obviously, L. was
nota stranger to sex and her mother‘s
comment upset me in is implication
thatrapeismuch worsewhenawoman
is a virgin. And it is difﬁcult to leave
this notion that a woman who sleeps
around, a woman who gets drunk and
leaves a party, a bar-- anyplace with a
man, is thesortof woman who willbe
raped. That that “kind of woman” is
“asking for it,”

Many women have sex; we all
wear provocative clothing at onetime
or another; some of us drink toomuch
and go home with strange men. No
one deserves to be raped. L. was hurt
