Misrepresentation

The Board of Publications is considering changing its
jurisdiction to include KGRW. The radio station'is seeking
t acquire olle of the positive attributes of the board; con»
{Tuning supel ' ' n and specialized interest in policies and
reeds. However, questions may be raised concerning some
< the more fundamental attributes of the board: What

licies underlie the distribution of power as displayed by
roles on tile board? What qualifications of journalistic
I: ioxlledge, both ideal and practical, do the voting members

55'! If changes appear desirable, the obvious time for
't‘lenl is during this period of change,

At present tlle Board of Publications publishes the
ltaverick, Cyclone, and Scarlet and Black. This involves
approving the budgets of each publication, and reviewing
hem at the end of each semester. In addition, complaints
a‘lout contents or policies are reviewed but with adherence
to the board’s policy of no prior censorship. Probably the
board’s most important single function is appointment of
two editors and business managers of the publications,

Officially, the voting membership includes one faculty
chairman, three facultyl members, one administration mem-
ber, three Student Council representatives, and one repre-
sentative of the stllden publications.

In practice the “Student Council representatives” are
‘tv‘le council president, and a member each of CofHP and
League Boar l The Student Council is not consulted about
these latter members, and they are unlikely to be council
l‘vlembel's.

In some respects it might seem reasonable for the "Stu—
c nt Council representatives" to be chosen this way, But
‘ is difficult to explain on the basis of official interest in
he publications The budgets of the Scarlet and Black and
the Cyclone depend to a large degree on allocations from
Student Council. With KGRW under its supervision, the
Board of Publications will have ultimate responsibility for
3 large percentage of studellts' money allocated by the Stu-
fent Council. No money goes from the League Board or
(,1 of HP to any of tlle publications. Yet each of these groups
tas as much voice in supervision of the publications as does

8 council.

Another aspect of SC»LBeCofHP voting rights has
to do with the nature of these three groups. The League
Board and CofHP are policy—nlakinggoverning bodies.
The Student Council is a representative body the voice of
tile students. Certainly the Voice of the students should
hire greater authoritv ill supervising free strident publica—
tions than should bodies wll‘ h ggvern the stlldellts.

I.ers of the board who know the current problems and

By Gene Thompson

already begun to applaud. It's
a Very worthwhile, highly ens
lcilaining play, and if the skill
of “Under Milk Wood" can be

should be as much of a success,

Some months ago I wrote
deprecntingly about the teens
ngers who circle the (lon
town block in ihcii cars, clntl
in lcvis and zipper-laden
leatllcrjnckets. (With the com-
ing of spring, their female
counterparts will be wearing
their oliicinl costume: levis,
T-shirts, and earrings.)

I referred to these people as
“sands” a combination of "seed"
and 00d”?
and i still think *1

“Soods” are
easy to ridicule

that more poor

I realize that

ridicule isn'l as

respectable as

the analyze-and-

sympalhize attitude of the see
cial Worker, but if you look at
lhc seed of driving age as a
person responsible for his ac-
tions, ridicule and a certain
lack of sympathy are perhaps
justiﬁed. ,

The teenager downtown is
usually a smalllown middle-
westcl‘n Child with broad shouls
dels and a narrow mindi Ridi-
cule infuriates him. He pictures
himself as a big-town gangster
and a soducer of women, but
he has neither the knowledge
and ability for the former nor
the technique for the latter. His
idea of “breaking the ice" is
a whistle and a grunt, and he
is unaware (since he doesn't
read ncwspzlpers, either) that
the bigvtlme gangster is hardly
a romantic ﬁgureithe modern

Kissane Previews "Mavericl(,'
Encouraged By Improvement

By James Kissane (English)

One of the difficulties I am faced with in reviewing V(
3, No. ill of Mare 'cll is the suspicion that this sort of tax
would be better left to students. Maverick is, after all,

and for them, and l llav

little desire to lasso, corral, bra;

or otherwise commit indignity upon a critter whose incl
pelldence of splrlt and general cussedness are its expli

boast. I am far from advocate
mg indifference, but perhaps
the mag we could be inocc
justly es lmated by snmeono
from the audience nt which it
is particularly aimed.

Another difficulty is an un—
certainty as to whether one
issue's specific content 01‘ the
magazine's general function, its
editorial pi-acliccs and problems,
is lhc more suitable subiect lin-
dlscussion. Maverick is obvious»
ly a smuggling magazine, and
qullc a bit could be said on lhe
questions of what is to bc gain-
ed by continuing
how it mlght be pursued, and
wlmi degree of ultimate success
ought reasonably to be expected
0n lhc other hand, those qucss
trolls are important only if each
issue deserves and receives
some attention of its own.

0n the basis of the issue
which I recently rcnzl in type '
script, 1 am not discouraged
nbnut Maverick if it does not
stand beside the science build—
ing and the recent production
of “Under Milk wliotl" as one
of the college’s more glitter-
ing trophies, it nevertheless
seems to be neriniming a
function which hardly needs
apology in providing a means
liar the expression of n cone
siderable variety of literary
talent. but my chief source of
encouragement is the distinct
impression that the upcoming
number of Maverick is an im—
provement over this year’s
previous two.

The contents of this issue may
be divided into foul- categories
which reflect the var ly 1 men-
tion: readers will find. besides
an editorial written in a fangs
llage unfamiliar to me, two
short stories, a group of parodies,
a couple of poems, and four
pieces which could be lumped
tcgclhci undEl‘ tlle classification
”sketches." The stories. by Barb
Ferries and Norman Leer. have
decided merit, though one is a
bit talky and the other is slight
ly overwritten,

The subieci of chman‘s
story 7 a sensitive college boy
on an important dale—,is scarces
ly startling but the authenticity
wilh which the hero's anxieties
are presented makes this lack
of ncvelty lcss a defect than a
virtue. Moreover, with his con-
clusion the author not only foils
the drab but suggests an “11*
portallt development in his
hero's Character. Barb's story
is more ambitious bclh in sub—
Ject and in narrative scope, for
it embraces the entire course
of an unsuccessful marriage.
The necessity for compressxon is
l‘nCl by telling the story in terms
cl a few climactic scenes, and
the chronological Shifts which
this method involves pmvide
the author with the means of
developing an ironic relation
ship between the action and its
ultimate outcome
