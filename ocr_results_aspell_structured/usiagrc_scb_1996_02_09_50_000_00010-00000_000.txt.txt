Earlier this season the Pioneers
handily defeated the Scots in Darby

Arseneniilt expressed concern about
a possible lack of intensity on the
part of his squad. “Last year we were
in miich the same position, having
gained a one-game leatl in the divi»

Monmouth. Brit we lost a game to n
Cornell team that was having an off
