THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Vacation Time Nears as Co-eds
Practice Milder Profanity

—- 2:
Various Plans Adapted
to Stop Swearing
for Home FlleS

Substitutes for profanity are be—
ing invented in the quadrangle
again as vacation-time nears. The
women are cleaning up their lan-
guage to save their reputations
with papa and mamma.

“Nov schmoz ka pop,” say the
James girls when they smash their
fingers in their dresser drawers.
(In case you don't get it, remem-
ber the little Russian hitch-hiker
in the funny-papers?) They don't
know what it means, but at least
it’s expressive.

sweet substitutes

“0h, fudge!n "Sugarl" and such
sweet substitutes are getting
passe, the women declare. There's
nothing about them that relieves
the feelings. Most of the co—eds
would rather give up the habit en-
tirely for the time being.

Two seniors in Haines have hit
upon a plan that seems to work.
Each time one catches the other
in a breach of lady-like language,
the culprit pays one cent. The
only trouble with the arrange-
ment, they say, is that they get
so mad at having to fork over
that they let off steam worse than
ever when they are alone.

Slap Wrists

A similar plan was tried by
two room-mates in Read last year.
Instead of paying up, the culprit
had to stand for a smart smack
on the wrist. The drawback to
that plan was the necessity for
wearing long sleeves to cover up
the red marks.

It all goes to show that Alice-
Leone Meats must be wrong in her
popular book, "No Nice Girl
swears.” Or could it possibly be
that orinnell women aren't nice
girls?

Them Sigs Begin Work
on Rummage Sale

Rummage boxes were placed in
each hall and cottage yesterday
to receive collections for the
fourth semiannual Theta Sigma
Phi rummage sale.

Elisabeth Dwight, treasurer of
the national honorary and profes-
sional fraternity for women in
journalism. and chairman of the
sale committee, announced that
the sale will take place some time
after spring vacation.

Boxes will be collected before
school closes for vacation. “We
hope that students will contribute
cast-off clothing when they pack
up to go home," Miss Dwight said
yesterday.

School to Recanuene

Spring recess will begin at noon
on Fn'day and will end at 8 o'clock
on Monday, 'April 5, according to
the registrar’s office.

for girls staying in crimiell during
the vacation, and Clark hall will
be open for men.

Absences will be counted at

progress with the years. Fresh-
man house chairmen say that the
girls come in sweet and innocent
(most of them), shocked at a stray
gosh or darn. By the time they
walk up for their sheepskins most
om them can compete with any—
body except a newspaper man.
Most Grinnell men disapprove
of women swearing, preferring to
keep the pn'vrlege for themselves.
And that tact, say the co-eds,
gives them extra chance to prac-
tice on housecleanlng their lan—

guage before vacations.

Newly Elected

The newly elected members of
the women’s League board Mon-
day night partially assumed their

Miriam Hopkins says:
"My throat welcomes Luckies—my favorite»
cigarette for 5' years”

"Luckies have been my favorite cigarette
for about 5 years. They’re a light smoke
that sensitive throats welcome. Of the
many trends that sweep through Holly-

wood, one of the

longest lasting has been

the preference for Luckies. I once asked
a ‘pmperty’ man—who supplies ciga-
rettes to the actors—what the favorite is.
He answered by opening up a box conv

"THE W

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Hopkins veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref—
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies.You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
