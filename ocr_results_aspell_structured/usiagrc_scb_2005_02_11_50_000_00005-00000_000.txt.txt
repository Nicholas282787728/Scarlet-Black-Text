Victim advocacy

On-campus program to help sexual as-

sault Victims planned
5v LAUREN STANDIFER

In the fall of 2003, when three students were smially assaultcd
oﬂ‘campus, issues faced by victims ofsex crimcs bccamc morc visiblc.
Though attention on thc subject has diminishcd, sonic Gllnnelllans
continue to keep the diﬂicultics faced by sexual assault victims at the
forefront ofthcir agcndas.

on Dec. 7, joint 13on votcd unanimously in support of a Just
Set-sponsored resolution to create an advocacy group for sexual assault
victims on campus While the proposal has bccn mat with widespread
support, thc specifics ofits operation havc yet to be worked out,

The resolution, drafted by Lola Garcia ‘06 with the consultation of
Just Sex and Helen Carey ‘04 of Domestic Violence Alternatives/Sex
ual Assault ccntcr- (DVA/SAC), providcs tor the crcation ofa group or
students whose task is “to make sure that [the victim is] supported every
step of thc nay," according to David Dchest ‘oo oriust Sex

According to SGA prcsidcnt Mark chry ‘05, one or about 20
trained voluntccrs would be in possession ora cell phonc with a publr
cizcd phonc ntrmbcr at any givcn time, Sexual assault Victims could call
this number for support and thc voluntecr could their help inform the
victim of her or his options and accompany him or her to the hospital
or to meetings with administrators, among other things.

Voluntcciswould have to complcts 32 holils ortmining from DVA/
SAC ilr dealing with sevual assault and domestic abuse victims This
training would tcach volunteers not only how to deal with the logistical
aspects of advocacy, but also ways to communicatc with survivors of
domcstic abuse, counscl assault victims and interpret Iowa law.

The advocacy group would aincuon as a College-speciﬁc outpost
of the statersponsored DVA/ SAC hotline on which many students
havc already worked. There are currently 24 snidcnts who have already
rcccivcd DVA/SAC training on campus, and 12 actively voluntccr to
work the phone linc, "Especially the calls at night are usually pcoplc
who just need to talk, and just need to tcll their story," carcy said. She
believes campus advocates may deal with similar calls from students.

Grinnell collcgc advocatcs would probably also rcccivc additional
collegesspcciric training to prepare them for campus-speciﬁc situations.
All volunteers would be legally conﬁdential

Henry said that SGA readily supported the resolution because “it’s
kind ota no-braincr that it would help the systcm.” ViccsPrcsidsnt for
Student Services Tom Crady and Dean for Student Life Jen Krohn
agreed that any rcsourccs to help victims ofsexual assault would bc a
welcome addition to the college's current proccdurcs.

Garcia said she took on this project because ofher own experience
as a sexual assault survivor. “Having someone whose primaryjob was to
look out for me would have made a world ofdifference,"shc said, “and I
basically am doing this bccausc there are women who need that, and it's
a need that's not currently being addressed by the administration."

Some proponents of the
resolution believe that an
advocacy group is necessary
because the central interest
of Student Affairs in a sexual
assault casc is tinding and
dealing with the perpetrator
rather than supporting the
victim. DeGeest agrees that
“grilt or innocence and de-
termining whether [a sexual assault] has happened or not is extremely
important,” but also believes the victim would beneﬁt from having an
advocatc who focused mostly on the victim's wclnrc.

crady feels that the administration will bow to the victim's wishes
conccnring what action to take, lfany. “When we hear about a case, we
try to offer a person options," he said.

l<rohn said that she generally agrees, but in certain extreme cases,
such as a repeat offender, Strident Affairs rnust take some action.

l<rohn said that avoiding colicgc liability is also a conccrn bccausc
in the late 19805, the college encountered cases in which victims would
report a sexual assault but ask StudentAffairs to do nothing, and then
would publicly denounce the college for its inaction on the case

Garcia said that she believes there have been instances where ad-
ministration has placed pressure on victims to have a hearing. citing her
own cars. “Even onc girl who feels like she was pressured or that she
was treated inappropriately is enough of ajuslification for me to say that
this is a necessary program," she said.

Mental Health Center Counselor Harrlctt Dickcthlrasins stressed
that social assault victims nscd to be given options and not be under
pressure from students or administrators. She said that sometimes in a
sexual assault casc thcrc are‘jllst too many pcoplc wanting to be helpful,
but feeling as though they havc to ﬁx something in order to be helpﬁll
and people who’ve been assaulted reeling pushed around by that."

At this point, the plan for actually creating the advocacy group and
deﬁning its functions iemains nebulous. Volunteers have signed up for
DVA/SAC training, but the additional training acquircd to well: as a
Grinnell advocate and who would provide such training scs us is un-
decidcd. Garcia is somewhat concerned about the process stalling, and
believes that “we’re at the point now when it’s going to take a real COIH’
mitment from administration to move forward."

“I think the campus advocatc systcm is still in a placc where how
exactly it's all going to play out 15 yet to bc dctcrmincd," said Garcia,
“but what issues it should address are very clear."

"ll’r kind lift; no—bmlher that it
would help the system."

Substance-free housing
expands by one dorm

Lazier slated as substance-free to open as substance-free next fall

5v LOLA GARCIA

This week the Housing Committee
voted to make Lazicr Hall substances
free.

Their recommendation is not bind
ing, butjcnnircr l<rohn, dean otstudcnt
affairs, has indicated that she would
support the committee's decision, ac,
cording to members of the committee.

substancc-rrcc housing became an
imminent issue for the committee after
Krohn announced that she would like
to see srrbstarrcctfree housing increase
to twenty-five percent of available Our
campus housing.

Currently, the college has one sub—
stancesfree dorm, Smith Hall. which
has fifty—two splices available to stun
dcnts. Ofthe 1159 spaces available on
campus,t saboutrourpcrccntorbcd
space. IrLaZiet becomes subsrancctttcc
next year, which sccms likely, there will
be 102 substancc rrcc spaces, which is
about tcn pcrccnt ofbcd space.

”We chose Lazlct because it
had the right amount of space, and it
was centrally located to both East and
south campus," Stephanie Masta, can
of the RLCs on the committee,

The Committee, which includes
Krohn, two RLCs and six students, ,5,
jcctcd toolin's rctjucst for twcnrytrivc
pcrccnt ofavallablc housing.“Thelc was
a vcry strong conscnsns that twenty-
rivc percent was much too lugh much
too quickly," said Phoebe Souza ‘02, a
student—at-large on the committee.

According to Masta, the proposed
nvcntytfrvc percent figure was based on
student surveys. “When we ﬁrst decide
ed to look at the increase in substance
rrcc housing we relied primarily on the
Health Surveys from 2002 and 2003, as
well as the housing survey all incom-
ing first years could complete." Masta
said in an email interview with the
Star/cl and Blur/t. About 24 percent of
the then incoming first year class (the
class of 2008) requested substancerfree
housing. She also pointed out that both
Health Surveys had ovct a sixtyshvc
percent return rate.

But when prct
sented with this
number, the Cour
mittee resisted.
“The big conccrn
[was] not providing
so mtrch so that [students] who didn't
want to live there are there,"said Souza

She said that initially l<rohn sccmcd
insistent on the [Wenwtﬁve porccnt rig-
lire. Last wcck the Housing Committee
hosted an open forum on the issue of iris
creasing substance free housing. Sixteen
students, including {our on tho commit-
tcc. attended. Ktohn also attended.

While most Students who attended
wcrc crurcatly living in Smith Hall, otht
crs voiced concerns about inctcasing
the amount at substancc—trcc housing.
“I think that [rwcnqeﬁvc percent] is
way too much," said Laura Zdunck ‘07,
who ancndcd thc forum, She says she

”l think generally people are mots
ing in that rhea/0n,"
Phoebe Souza ‘08

supported thc idea or changing Lazler,
“because it's a smaller dorm and the best
way to have substanccsrree housing is
to have a small percentage so that the
pcoplc who live there rcally want to be
there."

According to Souza, after the fo-
rum Krohn indicated that she would
support any recommendation from the
Housing Committee. l<rohn did not
respond to requests for intcrvicws.

Members of the committee have also
indicated that the amount ofsubstance-
trcc housing onscampus will likely in
crease even after the
addition of Lazlet.
“After next year, we
will reevaluate the
needs of the campus
and make adjust
mcnts accordingly,”
said Masta.

Souza described twentytfrve percent
as a "possible long-term goal."

“I think gcncrally people are mov-
ing in that direction," 'plained.
“The culture is really shifting, In three
years we want to fit the demand."

Souza also said the committee’s [66’
ommcndation showed that substance—
free housing was a success
