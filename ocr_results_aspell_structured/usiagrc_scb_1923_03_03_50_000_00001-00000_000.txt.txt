The ﬁnal game or the Grinnell Col—
lege basketball season will be played
tonight, when the Kansas Aggies come
here for the third gains or their Iowa
invasion. The Kansans have also -
played Amos and Drake, losing both
or the chines, the ﬁrst by a ll to 12
count for the closest score or this
hiisrorri Valley season, and the second
last night to Drake 31 to 12.

The Ames game was a real battle,
with neither side having an advan-
tage. The times team had a real
battle here last Tuesday night, and
the eitccts told heavily in their later
same, Rumuld, the Aggie center. was
high point man for them in the Ames
contest.

Thc Drake game last night was a
complete victory for the Bulldog team
Spurred by the game battle put up by
the Aggies ’against Ames Thursday
night, Drake took the floor primed to
the limit, and completely outclassed
the Kansans in every department of
the game.

During the ﬁrst halt or this contest
the Drake regulars gained an 13 to 4
lead, and shortly after the start of the
second half an entirely new team was
inserted, which more than held its own
during the remainder of tho set-to.

As in the Ames game, Rumnld was
high point man for the Kansas team,
followed by Grothusen, left forward.
anold with a ﬁeld goal and three
free throws made ﬁve points, and
Grothusen made tour points with two
ﬁeld goals.

The result of the - game tonigll
should be a victory for the Pionecrs
as they have had a foul‘rday rest atter
the Ames game, while the Aggies have
played two hard gamcs this wcclceno
The Pioneers defeated the Kansans de-
cisively in their ﬁrst game, running up
a 35 to 17 score on them, and should

The crowd that ﬁlled Her ck Chapel
Friday evening was a tribute to the
great Spanish 'cellist, Pablo Casals,
who probably has no peer in the ﬁeld
of ‘cello music. His tones are rich
with an unerring sense or delicacy
which is given only to a few artists.
With his bow he seems to draw pic—
tures and catches and portrays all the
varying shades. A technical'feature
was the wonderful speed displayed.
The Arioso by Bach gave him a splen-
did opportunity to display the vigor
and elasticity of his bowing and was
probably one ot the most plcasing
features or his program.

In place of the Larghetta Lamen-
toso by Godowsky the artist subs -
tuted an Air by Hure. His encores
were Fileuse by Fuure, Serenadc by
Popper, Mazurka by Popper an
Neopolitan Serenade by Sgambati.
The 'cello used was a modern French
instrument made by Lebert and was a
copy of a Guarnerlus.

The Grinncil cabinet government dew

Thursday night and Knox and Gales-

nual Gl'innel‘i— Knox - Carletoaneloit
quadrangular debate Belolt will also
meet Knox and Carleton in debates
on Friday night.

The aiiirmative team which debates
Carleton here will be composed of
Harry G. Barnes, '23, Paul Porter, '24,
and John Talbott, ’24. The men who
donate Knox at Galeshurg are, George
Harnagcl, '24, William Wood. Jr.. ’25.
and Eugene Murtagh, '23. These men
have all had the experience or the
Beloit dual, and have remodelled their
cases on the basis of weaknesses ex—
hibited in the debates last week.

Notable Judge.

These debates will be single judge
contests. The judge‘ will render an
expert decision, with reasons for his
decision at the close at the debate.
Professor J. hi. O'Neill, oi the Univer—
sity of Wisconsin, will judge the local
debate, while the head of the college
of Commerce at Iowa City will judge
the Knox contest. Prof. O'Neill is res
garded as one' of the most eminent
instructors of argumentation and de-
bate in this country. His text is used
by the local classes in argumentation
and debate.

The Grinnell ~ Knox - Carleton ~
Beloit quadrangular debate, is an an-
nuul affair, in which each school dev
hates two' of the others in decision coh-
tests. Last year Grinnell debated Be<
bolt and Carleton, winning from heloit
and losing to Carleton. They also held
a nerdeclsion dual debate with Knox.
Gl'iunell has already held a no-decision
contest with Be‘loit this year.

An attempt is being made to make
these debates rcal discussions of the

The question is “Resolved; That the
United States should adopt a system

similar in principle to that in ioroe in

In spite of persistent reports that
negotiations have been begun between
France and Germany relative to the

ernment had no intentions to make
an offer to France and was not even

Kemcl Defies Allies.

In a speech to the Turkish National
Assembly, Mustapha Kemal Pasha
stated that it the Allies do not agree
with Turkish proposals war will be
the only alternative. Kcmal declared
that the Turkish demands encroached
upon the rights of no other nation
but that Turkey was prepared to ﬁght
if necessary. Although not speaking
specifically on Lhe Lausanc Treaty
Kemal is known to regard the econ-
omic demands oi the treaty as entire—
ly inoompatahle with Turkish policy.

President Harding and Secretary
Hughes put the responsibility of the

the hands of the senate committee.
The answer from the White Honse
absolves the executive department
from any charges of stalling the issue,
