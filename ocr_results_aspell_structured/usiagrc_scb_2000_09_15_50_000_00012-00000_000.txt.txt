Michael who? I'wanna be like Dennis

You rcmcmbcr rhar old ad‘fcaturing
Michacl Jordan rhar went, “1 wanna bc like
Mike”? 1 do. 1r always made me sad.

Why was rhis ad so depressing ro me?
Because 1 know rhar, as hard asI rricd, 1 could
never be like Mike, He is one ofrhc
hnesr arhlcrcs in
memory and arguably the
grearcs! baskcrball playcrofall ‘
time.

Izm woefully un-
dcr six feet rail,
hardly ablc rn hir
the rim from
ourside rhc
three-point arc

recenr

and can just barely dribble my way our ora
paper bag on a good day, alrhough ir would
have ro bc a very rhin papcr bag and a very
good day.

So, bcrore 1 heard some amazing news in
late June, 1 had pretty much resigned myself
rhar 1 was never going ro b: a spons grcor or
have a carchy jingle wrirrcn abour me. The
nrws rhar changed my outlook was the an.
nounccment rhar Dennis Miller, rhc ranring
comic famous for his obscure rcrcrcncrs and

two balls, no strikes

sharp tongue, was going to be a color com—
menrator on “Monday Nighr Foorball" rhis
season.

Thark righr, Dennis Miller, A guy who
never played foorball. A guy who never
coached roorball. A guy who, for all 1
know, may never have held a roorbsll. And
yer wirh his appoinrmenr ro the MNF
boorh, a guy who became a household
name in roorball faster rhan a neutrino is
hurried from a prom-neutron srar during

a supernova event.

Ar 1am, I rhoughr,

1 can realize my
dreamsofbccoming
a sporrs hcro. 1r
Millcrcan maktsuchnstirlnrhcsporrsworld
hosrmg MNF, surely 1 can make an equally
big splash.

After all, I ﬁgure I'm ar least as qualiﬁed
as Miller for sporrs srardom. He’s appeared
on “sorurday Nighr Live" and won some
Emmys for hosring an HBO show; 1was on
my local news one: and won a coloring con»
test when l was in rhc rounh grade.

Miller has Spent ycars as a srand—up co-
mcdian; I’ve spent years rhinking rm runny

nicholas johnson

enough ro b: a stand-up comedian.

Mosr impormnrly, rhough, Miller’s razor
sense of humor has added a new dimension
m MNF; 1 say move over Dennis, because
I’m the Mach 3 so your disposable Bic.

Need proof? Look ar Miller’s rake on
Terrell Davis‘ leg wrap in the September 4
Broncos-Rams game: “Thar didn‘r look like
a re»wrap. The arrisr Chrisro didn-r use rhar
much fabric when he enveloped (he Pom
Ncuf."

'Now gander at mine. "Rewrap? That
looks more likc someone stole TuraAi-ikh-
Amun's lower appendage from Thebes and
grafted ir onro Davis.”'

You’d rhink after all rhosc years ofsrand»
up, Miller would know rhar Egyptian kings
are way runnicr rhan rhe French,

All rhis leads me ro one inevitable con.
clusion: ifMillcr can be a sports stud, I’m
destined ro be inducred ro some kind orhaii
orramc.

1n the mcanrimc. rhough, I’ll just throw
away my old Air Jordans and war or iii:
endorsement deals ro roll in. I can hear ir
now. “I wanna be 1 wanna be 1 wanna so like

Nicholas."
