He said, “This yenr'sJOBam
was uniq in that it accepted

and worked with all it had to
make the season a success".
Simone said that he has been
:accnstomed to giving his 'tesms

 

. a sliced-l k‘nown lo the swim,

mars as the “tw -ay bouler
vard speech" every year. The
idea or the talk is to tell his
team that he is giving sli he

sideiof the “boulevard" and
that he wants to see those on
