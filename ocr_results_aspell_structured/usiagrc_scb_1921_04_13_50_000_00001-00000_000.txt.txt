'Ior announcement in the near future,
it was said today. Tentative plans
include round table discussions for
the various departments or newspaper
work under the leadership of high
school and college journalists. Sey—
cral contests have been planned for
the papers, both in the mlmner of
makeup and editorial writing. A spe-
cial division will be made tor high

will be arranged for this kind of

number of representatives intendito

great interest in the new project, and
as many as five delegates are coming
from some of the schools. The Des i

nified their intention of sending two
or more delegates.

llembcrs of Sigma Delta Chi have
stated that all high schools in the
state or in this section of the coun-
try are invited to send dclcgates, and
that any students who wish to enter-
tain delegates from their home high
schools during the convention can do
so by making arrangements with Ru»
