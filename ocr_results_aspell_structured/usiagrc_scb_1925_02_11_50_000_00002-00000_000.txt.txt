Editor Scarlet and Black:

I do not know who wrote that oh,

itorial in last satin-day's Scarlet and

paper for the cmu'llgeollslmss and
timeliness of that article on “Crilr
hing." it was splendidly written~
and to the point.

While 1 am writing, allow me
say that 1 consider the Scarlet and
Black immensely better this year than
any year of the eight that I have been
in Griline'll. ‘ I Wish especially to
commend you for the “World at
barge” column. It is at real addition
to the paper. I also am appreciative
o: the "At Chapel" column. cur
chapel is distinctive. Each speaker
gives his or her‘hest at chapel and if
it is WOI‘Lh listening to, it is worthy ol
notice in your paper.
