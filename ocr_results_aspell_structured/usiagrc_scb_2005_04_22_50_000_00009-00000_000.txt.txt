Bored? Try a night on the town

I know you've seen all of those
piospectivc students running around
the past icw rvcckcnds Thcy all want
to know what there is to do in Gl’ll‘l’
ncll. Actually, even with your myriad
social expciieiice behind you,yoii may
be wondering what the town ofGriiis
ncll has to offer iiyou're not fccliug
like shakin' your thang at Harris or
arguing with your floormatcs about
who has the most homework.

Even ifyour social calendar is full.
you may consider penciling in some
of these classic Grinnell offerings.
The key to discovering activities in
the town of Grinncll is the ability to
think “ifl were a townie, what would
I be doing right nuw>”Thc answer is
not ”I’M/1y} “scooping the loop."

' Carmen‘s: live music sometimes
happens outside of Gardner. In the
summer, there are free concerts every
Thursday night in the park.

By “(he park," of course 1 mean
Central Park, which is downtown,
Where the Farmer's Market is. By
the Community Center. Across from
Main squeeze. A little ways south
from the new Chinese restaurant.

If none of these directions has
rung a bell for you, leave campiis im-
mediately and don't come back until

you know somcthing about thc town
you re living rn, for crying out loud.

- Hy—V :downtuwn cafcs like the
[\de orlvlairi-Rite may come
to mind when you think of
local cats, but don't dismiss
the fine cuisine prepared
by the helpful smiles in the
aisles of Grinnell's largest
grocery store.

The dining room
at Hy~Vec always
has an especially
remarkable break-
fast. and especially
during hunting
senson.Tty making
the trek out to The
Vet: at around 5 or
o in the morning,
peihaps after a long
night.

~ T/it Bowling
Alley: State Street
may be a seemingly
innocent furnituie
marker/motorcyclc
repair center by day, but on wccks
nights the street is lined with soupcd»
up pickups, hinting at the craziness
going on indoors,

Two words can sum up all the mad

ricss, No, not A1 Kuhiill. League night!

lfynu’rc feeling especially competitive

you could bring your twnrtone slices

and strut your stuff out on the laucs

on league night, but you'd probably

be better offpracticing at a different
time hefoie you attempt that one.

- The City Pool {mlnmei‘ only} 1

bet you didnt know whcrc was more

than one pool in Grinncll, did

you> This ones across from

the high school (there‘s only

one or those), and charges

a nominal fee for

you to cool offuns

it with the high
school team.
Orifyou'rclooks
ing for relaxation,
join every single
child in Grinncll on
a hot afternoon to tan, take a dip, and
look popular by talking on yoru cellie.
- Haiiiiiiigin- Hill (ruin/er only):
conveniently locatcd up Park strcct at
the north and of town, this is where

all the rownics go to lcr gravity take
them on a pulscspoundiag ride over a
solid form ot'wnter.

That’s right, Hamburger Hill is
Grinnell’s best sledding spot, It’s to
your right after the disc golf course;
just follow the happy shouts of chils
dren, A word of cnutton: aim your
sled (oi dining hall tray) carefully, as
you don’t want to end up in the writer
hazard.

- Sperm/Emir; If you don't read
the Pannyrrnrr, you really should.
There’s actually nothing in it about
pennies. Where else will you learn
about things like the Taco Dinner
sponsored by the High School Band,
the Knights of Columbus Fish Fry,
garages sales with pool tables or Cat-
tle Auctions?

These are only a few ofthe invigos
rating and engaging activities GrlnT
nell has to offer. As you grow more fa-
miliar with your town, you’ll find your
own favorite entertainments

Just remember to play nice and
treat members of our community with
respect. Because ifyou don’t, it’s back
to the weeknight procrastination den
hate and Harrisspartysonly weekends
for you,sucker

Balancing between silence and belligerence

it began when my sister Hayley came home from
a playrdate with her nursery school friend Madr
eleilie.

“lVIadclcinc doesn't have a
ed,

“Yes she (loes,"l siiitl Though I had never met
Madeleine or seen the receptacle in question, I was
in first giadc, and I figured that pretty much
made me an authority on everything. “coriyi.
07er has a trash can."

“Not Madeleine.”

“Well, what does she do with her trash,
then?"

“She throws it out the window." Hayley
announced this with complete confidence.

“She showed me."

1 don't havc the time or rhc space to
recreate the entire argument here, and
trust me; you don’t want to hear it. Suf-
ﬁce it to say that things quickly
degenerated into pure malice
(“Stupidheadl” "Liarl" “Bossy
Pantsl”). Worse, the Battle of
Madeleine's Trash Can didn’t really ever end, but be-
came like a chronic illness, popping up on those rare
periodic occasions when Hayley and 1 had nothing
else to squabble over.

Of course, neither one of us really cared about
what Madeleine did with hcr garbage, but we fought
about it because we were both passionately commits
ted to being right. For this reason, we could and did

trash can," she rcporrs

fight about any number ofotlicr equally inane topics,
including whether or not bears have tails and who
got to stand on the rice stump at the bus stop,

Now, last Thursday, as I walked from the Fine
Arts building to my aparrmcnt on Firth i\vcuuc,l
passed two people; a man holding a sign with a pic
tuie ofa bloody fetus on it, and a woman that handed

mc two pamphlets, one that explained a purported
link bctwceii abortion and hrcast cancer, and ins
other entitled “Birth Control; Homicidal Der

ccprion."
l fcrucnrly disagree with
the proslife cause, but I can
respect those who have
seriously contemplated
the issue and have
comc to a different
conclusion than my

self.

However, I cannot respect
anyone who manipulates infors
mation and spreads lies to fur
ther their own cause, particularly

when they consider their cause to be a moral issue;
such behavior revcals a lack ofintegrity. ldon't think
that the owners ofthe “truth van”care nearly as much
about truth as they do about...being right. Or ap—
pearing to be right, anyway.

But wait; bcrorc you start feeling all superior, rcs
member that Gtinnell College students arcn'r always
known for their calm and iational approach to poli~

let’s be honest. Being perry,
belligerent and self-righteous lee/s
wonderful It: way more fun than
iational discussion.

tics'l‘hank God niost ofus don’t go aiound plesentT
ing lies as scientific truth, (I think the Noyce~dwelleis
would have something to say about that) burw We all
had run belligerent and self righteous moments.

Let s be honest Being petty belligerent and sell?
righteous feels wonderﬁif It s any more fun than tnr
tioual discussion For example, though I think that
thc SA'ls ire air arbitrari and pretty worthless wav
ofmcasuring iiitcliigcncc,l love to tell pcoplc thatl
scored higher than our current president.

In fact, i basically level in ev-
ery mistorrurie that George W.
Bush cncountcrs, from choking
on pretzels to mangling his words
to falling off bicycles. I would
have loved to have hurled some
choice phrases at those anti-abor-
tion protesters, too; I've got some
epithets in mind that are fat miss
tier than anything I've ever called my little sister.

i didn't approach them, though, because I had
a feeling that any confrontation between us would
have ultimately just been unpleasant and not have
resolved anything.

I’m not really proud of my decision to be passive,
but I’m not ashamed ofit either. In fact, as I sit here,
long past my deadline I’m still lacking any conclusive
thoughts on the issue.

Ultimately, I guess you've got to strike the right
balance, which is somewhere between silence and
screaming over a trash can.

Putting it all in perspective

I was going to mitt about being sick, or people
getting mad at me for getting them sick, or a num-
ber oi'orhcr unimportant things. And then I realized
therc was a reason I always feel petty and ungrateful
when I write ints. Like everyone else, I bitch about
everyday thing. hat get to me, from dinner at (hand
to the laundry machines not working. When you're as
privileged as we are (I don‘t care who you are, if you
go to this school, you have food, clothes, shelter, and
a good education, and theiefore are better all than a
good portion of the world) its easy to channel nanu‘al
anger and fnistration into trivial things. But it‘s un-
settling to me that I was going to bitch about having
bronchitis {or a week and a half, when I could just as
easily be starving to death or dying ofAiDs.1 need
to remember what’s really important.

Bikes + Ioggia doors = stupid

What's up with people leaving bikes in front
of the loggia doors at uight> They block the en-
Lrances/exits and are probably a ﬁre ha’lard Some
of them are even campus bikes l mean ifyou want
your own bike to get knocked over by a loggia door
swung open by some innocent, unsuspecting college
student in a hurry somewhere, fine. but wrecking
the campus bikes? Come out
