“On a western Campus."

The members of the class of ’98
certainly hit upon a novel idea
when they decided to writeiaild
publish—a volume of short stories
as a Junior Annual. The result is
a book that is not only uniquc,
but a thorough success as wcll.
Most of the numbers ill the vol—
ume, indeed, can hardly be called
“stories.” it deﬁnite plot and Ma
tion are implied in the term; they
are rather sketches of various
phases of western college life, sits
uations and impressions, observed
and reproduccd by young people
ot academic training, and varying
rather widely in maturity and ser i-
ousness. Taken forwhat they are.
these sketches are excellent; they
are “human documents“ of real
and permanent value, as recording
faithfully certain sides of under-
graduatc, and especially co-edur
cational life and experience on
the western prarrics toward the
close of the nineteenth century,
and as representing not uniarrly
the literary ability of tile students
ot this day.

Onethingthatmust strike every
attentive reader of this volume,
and especially one not familiar
with the life it reflects, is the
wholesomencss of its tone. lie-
yond question, college lite as tllcsc
young observer-s see it is thor-
oughly healthy and normal; there
is a total lack of morbidness and
foolish sentimentality, as well as
of the cant that so easily colors
the public utterance of young peo-
ple of good Christian antecedents
and training. The relations of
these “co-educated” yormg peo-
ple are evidently quite frank and
inartiﬁcial. even somewhat un—
conventional on occasion. and that
is cause for sincerc congratulation
in these clays when too often even
babes and sucklings arc blast: and
sophisticated. Not that we have
here the rude and simple life of
the frontier and the settler; far
from it. Evidently the primitive
habits of pioneer days are so far
away in the past that they have
becomehistoric,almostlcgendary.
It is a signiﬁcant fact that in the
whole book there is but one pass-
ing reference to the student wllo
“works his (or her) way through
college.” On the whole, the life
portrayed is quite ”modern"7in

its more complicated social lela-
tions, in the character or the col-
lege work, so tar as this is menr
tioned, in the very vocabulary.
though that is not offensively
laden with jargon; most ot‘ all,
perhaps, is the absorbing inter-est
in uprtonatc extrarscholastic ct-
fort and organization; note that
athletics and the Glee Club are
prominent. but that the nrorc oldi
fashioned litcrary society is cons
spicuous by its nonrappearaiice.

It is none the less evident, how-
ever. that the life of the midland
college is still very ditierent from
that at the great eastern llnlvcr»
sityifar less complex and more
Centralized.less cosmopolitan and
unregulated; it is not altogether
due to local conditions that the
atmosphere is notably free flon'l
the fumes of “ﬁzz” and tobacco~
smoke, and tronr the “sporty"
reek that is not unknown where
studentscongregate;meerschaums
and cards do appear, but on just
one page in two hundred and ﬁfty,
and there merely as stage proper
ties, so far as the _stoiy is con-
cerned. In this connection we
may note the 'abscnce of Frater-
nity life, for the ”Alpha Nu” that
rimidly makes its appearance once
or twrce is palpably spurious, and
has about as much vitality as a
calico cat. One is impressed
throughout witlrthccsscntialunity
and practical homogeneity of the
institution at Herndon, with the
feeling that the College is not only
adistinctcommunity,butafamily,
in whose ﬁlial devotion and pride,
and fraternal sympathy and mutu-
al helpfulness, are real and con-
stantly effective influences; and
the boyish and girlish pranks re
corded only serve to heighten
this impression.

The crucial question, however.
is as to the success ol’ the twelve
writer-s represented in this book,
in working up their various sub
jectsmatter into literary form. In
one all-important respect the an-
swcr is quite favorable; these
young authors, almost without ex—
ception, have learned to keep their
eyes and ears open; their prodllcs
tions are not vain attempts at “orr
iginality” and pompous generalis
zation, but are based upon actual
and appreciative observation, res
