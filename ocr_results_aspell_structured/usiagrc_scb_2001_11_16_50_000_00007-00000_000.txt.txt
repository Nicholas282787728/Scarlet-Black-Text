Most customers passed with only a sideways glance at the Sul—
dents’ banners and signs. lsut one man didn't approve. He drete up
in a bigblueChevyTahoe, parked on the rarside orthe nearlyernpty
parking lot and Canl'Ed the store. On his Wily out, he looked the
students and said, “Why dont you do something productive?" Most
smiled back at him, and began chanting again, even louder, "Hey.
hey; ho, ho, staples has got to go recycledl"

At 10 am. on Tuesdmy. Nov. 13th, 11 students From Grinncll's
Free (ill: Planet (FTP) as well as two other students from lawn Sutt-
and Simpson College gnlhcrcd outside the Staples store In Ankeny.
lowa, to protest the chains use ofoldrgrowlh paper products,

Thc Grinncll students procnted the store manager with a letter
calling for an immediate phaseour afall wood and paper products
made from old-growth wood and wood harvested on US public
lands, a commitment to achieving so percent post—consumer con.
tent for all paper products within two years, r immediate phaseout
orall products that are loo percent yirgin wood rrber, and the avalile
ability or 100 percent postconsumer paper in all stores.

The protest was part ofa nationwide dayoraction against staples
organised by Forest Ethics, a national orgnnlunon with headquare
tcrs in San Francisco and Wohington. DC, Over 200 protests took
place at staples stores across the country. An action olsimilar scope
and content took place last year as well.

Tire action is modeled after the successful campaigns against
Menards and Home Depot that have taken plaee over the last several
years which have forced the companies to cirarrge their policies to
“old-growth free." Grinnell's FTP was heavily involved in both of
those campaigns.

The protesters gathered initially in the parking lot or
KFC next door to staples to hand oirt signs and make
sure everyone was there. The Grinncll contingent met

up with the student from lowa state and marched over to the staples
store, carrying signs and a banner.

When the protesters arrived, the Smpiﬁ shift manager on duty,
Kendra Kelly, called another staples store in Arm: to ﬁnd if there
were protesters there too and to rind out itanyone knew what to do.
There weren't protesters in Amcs; the Ankeny action was the only
one in the state. Last year, while Kelly qun'l a manager, she recalls
being warned ahead or time that the Protesters were coming. Tlrrs
time she had no Warning, Arter her call, the Arnes store faxed her a
one page handout outliningwhar to do when confronted with “envi-
TonmellmilStS/mcrivists.” it told her to steer all questions to a national
omce outside boston, and no one horn the store was to confront the
protesters She passed this information on to the various press sources
arriving from print. radio and television.

Quoide the store, the protesters held up a banner reading “staples

and the one that took place the week before against CitiGl‘oup: radi—

“it's sort of like making Fun of (the

Oretrrlantl '02, the only male cheerleader, said.

Sarah Weiss '04 added, “You can't get too cheesy, which is the
best parr."

The goal orradrcal cheering is to keep the atmosphere at a

' protest energiicd. “One ofthe problems we've had in the past

with protests is after the first 20 minutes when a lot of the
press is gone, people lose momentum," Weiss said “This is
key in gryrng people the chance to relax and keeping moment
turn and energy up. Things need to keep moving constantly,"
it‘s not an easy job though

“it means that we have to have twice the energy because
we’ll be chanting then we‘ll be cheering then we'll be chanting
and we don't really get a break," Mollie Hayward ‘04, another

cheerleader and co.leader of HT. said.

The idea or radical checrleading at Grinnell was born at the
Eco-Action conference put on this fall by Iowa—STEP (Iowa
students Toward Environmental Protection). Terrill Legiierr '05

learned a cheer at a Nader protest last year and taught it to the
group.

Molly Offer—Weston '05 was also at EcnrAction and learned
the cheer. “1 had never heard of mdiul cheerleading before and I
thought it was awesome," she said.

When they got back to campus after that weekend. a group
decided that radical cheerleadirrg would be a great thing to start at
Grinnell so they looked it up oirline and talked other people into it.

The important acquisition for the radical cheerleading group so

Hayward took on the task orFinding the pom.poms and most
she found on the internet cost six or seven dollars. She didn't think
she could ask each cheerleader to spend $15 ,ust on poms. so she
kept looking fol cheaper alternatives. She found some For 53 each on
the inrerrret from Texas, she called the man up, and he told her that
they were out ofstock on that kind.

she said that she couldn’t alrord them at any other price and he
told her he’d “make them up special" just for her at aspccial price or
only 53.50 each Just in the colors she wanted. He was really insistent
that she not tell anyone where she got the cheap poms because he
couldn't make that deal for anyone else.

“I don't think he knew ouite understood what the group was,"
Hayward said “I kept being like, ‘I don’t know anyone else to tell:
We're last nine radical cheerleaders at Grinnel]; he probably thought
we wereatsorne state school orsomcthing where the othcrgirls would
say. Those are some heat poms, where'd you get themz' But we’re
really not "

There is a balance though between having inn and getting the
message out. “Most people want to see me in a skirt," Orcmland
said. “I don't have a problem wearing a nice green
skirt or something. but i was afraid it might dis.
tract from what we were trying to focus on. we
don't want the media focusing on the tall guy in
the skirt."

see them branching out to worklng with other
organisations, like RISE ora peace group. at their
protests

What’s the point?

The main goal or this type of protest is getting coverage on TV,
radro and in newspapers, known as “media hits," “We're trying to
damage [staples’l rrnage." Hayward said, “and media hits are how we
can contact people who worrld never see us at the protest."

oremland added, “it’s the best way to get out the word on why
we're doing the ctmpnign."

Weiss, a calendar or FFP, the said that reeruitrtrenr and retell»
tion are a key parts of any protest. She said a major goal of this type
ofprottst is to train more peopleon how to run protests and how to
deal with the media. as well as increasing the energy in the group.

FTF is currently working in tour subgroups: global warming
(which ran .r protest against CitiGioup last week), endangered {or-
ests (which ran the Slapiﬁ action). clean water and networking/loun—
STEP. Each campaign has both a local and a national component.
For example, the endangered forest subgroup is not only working on
the staples action nationally. but is also working with the college to
use more eiwironmenotlly friendly paper

“lfyou combine a cirgeted national campaign with load initia-
tive, you can really effect change," FTP member Matt Ewing '02
said. “Generally, we ﬁnd that the combination nflhosc two [gets the
most accomplished]."

As the protest was ending and the students were marching out or
the staples parking lot, the man in the blue chevy Tahoe returned.
Again he asked why they eorrldn't do something productive, this time
adding nrare colorful language. and though this time a bit conitscd
as to why someone would go to the staples in Ankeny, lowa twice in
a half hour, rhe protesters had the same rcncllon: they kept going.
“Home Depot did it; staple-s should, stop selling old growth wood!"
