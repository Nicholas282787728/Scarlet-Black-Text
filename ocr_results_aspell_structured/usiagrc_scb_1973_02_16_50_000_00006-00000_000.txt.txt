KDIC board felt that the Fund should
receive the donation as it has in the
past.

KDIC took over the operation ofthe
auction last year trom the campus
Christian Fellowship group, which
had conducted the auctionfor sever-
al years and donated theproceedsto
the Martin Luther King fund.

As of last summer the Fund con»
tained about $35,000, according to
Associate DeanJames Hamilton, and
the amount has increased steadily
Since its formation in 1969.

Tile Fund is Composed entirely of
endowment money. It was created
partly from existing College endow-
Illent, but has thrived since prin—
cipally on contributions or alumni,
Trustees, Iilitl other friends of the
College.
