C All Open Letter.

Mr. Kent Hampton, president.
Student Council.
Grlnnell College
Dear Hamptol

Another year is about to open for the Stu-
dent Council. When it is over, student
government will mean lunch to the stu—
delits, or it W11 sink to the pit of oblivion,
from which it has risen in the past few
years.

May we suggest that the best way to
insure the success of the Council is through
adequate publicityiand publicity is not
free advertising

For the success of your organization,
wouldn’t it be smart to keep the student
body well-informed as to what goes on in

Q The Cutting System.

The new cut system has undoubtedly calls-
ed more student comment than any other
single change in the college rules and regu-
lations this year. Far from “clamping
down” on individual students' liberties, the
new system was devised as the only fair
and intelligent basis for the four credit
class set-up.

Rather than the loss of one hour's credit
for overcutting, the new system places the
emphasis upon the student—professor rela-
tionship, which is as it should be. The in-
dividual professor knows how much the
student is getting out of his course and
when he can afford to be absent. And one
credit is not easy to make up when all
classes are four hours.

Still, we don’t see why students who have
demonstrated superior ability and judgment
should not be permitted discretionary
cutting privileges. Is there no reward for
merit?

To the Editor:

Under the provisions of
some hoary, unauthenticated
agreement way back when
editors of the S & B made
money and were prone to do
rash things, it seems that
past—editors of the rag, when
they had joined the dear-de
parted, were sent same,
either as ’\ good-will offering
or as e dence of how the
sheet had improved during
the current administration.

To me, when I was running the
paper, the placing of names of
blokcs, whose only claim was that
they had been editor or business
manager during the own Wsi~,oii
the circulation lists was a gi-ievr
ous crime, subject to sharp ")7

ABC went through the records.
