NEW REGISTRATION IS

Greater Emphasis Put. on Spring
Registration With System‘
Just Adopted.

The new system or registration.
which was put into elioct this your at
Griiiiiell. has proved vc , sallsliirtorl
in the trial ot the hill registration and
momis s increased value in the in-
turr. Changed slightly to suit the
needs of the ins itutioii lierc, llic sy

to that so popular
in other colleges.

The plan is to lai greater emphasis
on Spring rcgistiation and therolore
avoid thc iornici- rush at the opening
or the tollegc year. At the Spring
registration iinrc nioiiiho ol' lho
three lower classes are given an op
poi-trinity to corner with their adrisor,
the head oi the doparliiient in which
they intend to major, and sign up ior
the lleI. Year's ll Ol'Il.

in the Fall the new class alone are
assigned to laculti registrars, while
the old students we ivc cards, dupli-
cating their registration in the Spring,
which have been tiled in the oliice.
lrpon payment oi tuition and soiiicstcr
too, this is signed by the secretary and
returned through him to the registrar.
From the registrar's otiite car-d‘ ior-
each student registcred loi- cach course
are then sent to the dillci-ont instruc-
tors. A stub, given to the student, has
his schedule oi classes. '

Besides doing away with the signing
oi class cards by the instructors, the
new sy om w l lllallo registration
more ollirial, will emphasize thc r
latioiiship between the strident and his

rctords Facility inerube s approve the
new a ngcnieiit generally, though it
demands more time ior class lists at
