Cary Grant says:
“alight smoke rates aces high
with my throat’

"Luckies have been my cigarette for
ﬁve years now. I rate them a 4 star
cigarette. They’re always good to the
throat, and taste so much better than
other cigarettes that it seems to me
this ‘Toasting’ process is a swell idea.
Yes, a light smoke like Luckies rates
aces high with both my throat and
taste.”

APPEARING IN THE NEW
COLUMBIA PICTURE, “WHEN YOU’RE IN LOVE”

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those. who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they

personally prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Grant veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref:
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen arid opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection‘ of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
“It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
