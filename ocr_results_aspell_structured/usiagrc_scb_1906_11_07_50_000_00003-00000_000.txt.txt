tian Association. Already in the
cities groups were growing up and
organ' ' gas Christian Associations,
and these created the international
Board. While union has long seemed
desirable it could not be effected be-
cause of the different ideas of the
leaders of each. The American Cornr
mitteerfelt thata uniform basis for
membership was necessary, namely.
membership in a Protestant Evangeli-
cal Church. The International Board,
on the other hand, thought each As-
sociation might choose for itself the
basisior membership. The two are
now on the eve of union. At the De-
troit Conl'ention a. meeting was ar»
ranged between the representatives
oerach, with Miss Grace Dodge of
New York, who has known both sides
and yet afﬁliated with neither. as
chairman. Anagreementsatisfactory
to both Was reached. The Interna-
tional Board consented to ask its As-
sociations to come in on their present
basis, within two years, after which
time there shall be the Evangelical
basis for all. The principal conces-
sion of the American Committee was
the change of its headquarters from
Chicago to New York. The report
of the joint committee was brought
before anational convention of each
organization and both voted to unite
On this basis. A joint Committee was
then elected from both with Miss
Dodge again as Chairman, and they
have been at work since January,
They have opened oiiices in Chicago,
studied the history of both organiza-
tions, and the best possible organiza-
tion or the new body, In the matter
of the deﬁnition of an Evangelical
church. they have given an option.
Either the deﬁnition in our present
constitution, formulated bya certain
national Y. M. C. A. convention, or
the deﬁnition of the Church Federa-
tion may be adopted in stating the
evangelical basis for membership.

After the devotional meeting led by
Miss Clara Anderson of Des Moines,
Miss Henshaw opened the second cul-
iege conference.

Miss Wilbur gave suggestions (or
the preparation for a state secretary‘s
visit. it should begin where we begin
for the year's work. We should make
a close analysis of our own work, and}
if we discover anything that preventsv
progress, tell the secretary before she,
comes. From her visit we expect a,
spiritual awakening and in our pre-
paration and advertising we should
show agieat expectation. Much prayer
is necessary in preparation for her
coining. We must lmow what yirls
need help we aunot give and be ready
to bring her into personal touch with
the secretary. The secretary needs
vvitliher during her stay agroup oi,
girls who linow the aims and needs oi

with her delinitely and ti'ustfully.

iaxiyed its importance.

Its object is to make Christ real
and to bring girls into the habit of
devotional study or the Bible. Itis
the foundation of each committee’s
work but the Devotional, the Financai
and the Missionary need it most. If
the girls have learned in this way
what God has given them they will
not object or complain about giving,
The Missionary committee is never
strong when the Bible study is weak.
After it follows the desire to know
more of Christ's kingdom and share
in its extension.

“If ye abide in rue and my work
ltbiilc in you ye shall aslr what ye will
anditshallbe done unto you.” We
cannot be disciples of Christ inservice
unless we have IIis spirit and this
comes to us through devotional study
of His truth. The lives greatly used
of God are never or those who neglect
the study or His word.

A strong Bible Study committee
should be organized in the spring.
The classes should be planned, the
leaders chosen, and their work assign-
ed before the summer recess. If pos-
sible the leaders should attend a
summer conference.

Helen Clark discussed the impor
tance of Mission study.

The Nashville convention gave us
an idea of the general value ofmission
study. We may well remember that
it St. Paul had not obeyed his call and
come westward, the east might. be
sending us missionaries today. A col~
lege girl’s lire is inclined to be narrow

and self~centererl and mission study is
broadening.

On the missionary committee strong
girls are needed. It is hard to conduct
asuccessful missionary campaign be-
cause we are accustomed to look upon
missions as far all and uninteresting. ‘
The courses and leaders should be
selected in the spring. The topics
should be live ones, and the girls at-
tractive. Lastyear Social Service was
the most attractive course. Have a
Mission Rally in the fall which will
give the brighter Side of missionary
work. Then make a canvass oi every
girl in school. To keep up the inter-
est let some member of the committee
be responsible [or each class, and per»
