Kolp, Macoubrey Carry Tone
Throughou’r Tense Melodrama

By Betty Lou Johnson

The Lady Who Came To Stay, directed by Kent An-
dl-ews, gave ARH audiences melodrama in large doses Dec.
14 and 15, and did it skillfully, Seven scenes of almost un-

relieved horror were rounded
performance.

The burden of the play's eon-
tinuity was ably carried by Bal-
bai-a Macoubrey, iii the role or
flighty, frustrated Milly, and
Carol Kolp, as the uncompl‘or
mising Emma, Jean Mitschrich,
as Katherine, the title role. and
Mary McMilrray, playing the

- violent Phoebe, successfully
carried their conflict from life
into the spiritual world.

Supporting Roles

Supporting roles or Ann, sweet
young daughter of Katherine,
played by Frances Chapman; her.
suitor Roy, portrayed by Darrelll
Edd - housekeeper Sadie, with
Gloria Laurie; and David An-
drews, son of Mr, and Mrs Kent
Andrews, as Katherine’s little
son. were all well integrated with
the play as a whole, The doctor,
played by Julius Weiss, had becni
added late in the rehearsal sche-
dule. and, although it may have
seemed a bit unnecessary, did
provide a chance for the scene
where seven-year-old David An-
drews presented his spiritual play-
mate to an incredulous Aunt
Emma.

Conllict between
hidden evil and a more nearly,
normal way of life conti-niiedi
throughout the play as the ghosts
of dead Phoebe and Katherine
made their Sisters’ house scene of
a battle royalia battle for the
souls of surviving family members
and their well-being. To this we
viewer, Miss McMui-ray's superb
control and timing and Miss
Mltchrich’s lovely voice and hear-
ing added much to the numerous
ghost scenes. The gradually ris-
iiig importance of Miss Macau-
hrey‘S role as Milly, along with
Miss Kolp's mounting hysteria.
seemed to set the tempo of the
play. _David Andrews. in his first
speaking port, showed unusual
poise and stage presence for a
child of his age.

Excellent Cllaratccrizntinns

For the audience, Kenneth
White's play The Lady \Vllo Came
To Stay gained credibility in the
or nell pertoi-mance. Characters
izations, particularly or the sisters,
actually outdid the script at
times, as in P’hoebe’s line, “You
hold the tunnel, Emma, and I‘ll
pour the rot into him," when shc
was bargaining for the little boy.
other cast members, such as
Darrell Eddy and Julius Weiss,
did not fare so well,

Compliments go to a deserving
production Staff, headed by stage
