in one of the most desperate games
ever played by a Grinneli basket-
ball team, ilac Eachron's tosscrs de-
t‘ealcd iowa last Snllll'dul' evening by
a score at loels. The game was
ﬁerce. snappy and some-what des-
tructive to anatomy, Tile Iowa team
used the dribble a great deal and very
successfully, dribbling several times
the full length of the ﬁeld, biit failing
to make the basket at the end. The
size or the court handicapped the
Grinnell men, who only got into effect—
ive team work during the latter part
of the second half.

Before probably the largest crowd
that ever packed into the S. U. I.
Armory, the game was called shortly
after 3 o'clock, The game started with
a rush, Zeigler securing the ﬁrst has-
ket on a pretty shot. Then Iowa
forged ahead and maintained a snail
lead till the end oi the ﬁrst half when
the score stood 11 to u in favor of
lowa.

At the ﬁrst of the second halt Iowa
secured two more baskets making the
score 15 to 9 with about 8 minutes to
play. Then Gl'l'lllleli started a spurt;
Captain illaclsachron, Carney, Ziegler
and howcil all getliig baskets in quick
succession. This with two tree throws
made the score 19 to 15 with about a
minute to play. til-land in this time

thio , and the game ended with the
bail in lowa's territory with the score
is to 19.
