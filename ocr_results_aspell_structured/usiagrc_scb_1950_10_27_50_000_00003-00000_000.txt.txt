To The Editor: 1
' Your correspondent of last
week, Merle Fishlowitz, held up
before us a dazzling idea of the
ultimate in liberalism . . . open—
ing the library and the Union
from in to 11 for nonrcllapel
goers Shades of the Liberty
Bell:

But it hath a cracked sound.
The gentleman confuses liberal»
ism with neutrality. Religiously
speaking Grinnell is not neutral,
It is proreligious and seeks to
implement its positive attitude
by Specific observanpes, of which

Chapel is one. True to its liber-t

alism it does not compel anyone

to attend; consonant With its re-

ligious emphasis it séeks to re
move or minimize distractions.
Sincerely.

WINSTON L. KING.

Manusdripl Club Takes
Six' Addifional Members

With the addition of six new
writers, ,the membership of the
Manuscript Club has reached a
total at twenty three. Those
elected to the club include Aud-
rey dee, Nan Elinslie, Judy
Helirich, Frances Holcstine, John
Durham and Nick Plediscalzl.
On November 5 these new moms
bers will be initiated into the
club at the home of Miss Evelyn
Boyd who sponsors the group.
The present otiicers of the
Manuscript Club are Jim Kis—

Vldual” is “quite justifiable. This.
does not mean, however, that‘
Library and Union facilities:
should be available during this;
hour. Empty classrooms are open ‘
and may be used for study. and
all the coffee counters downtown
are ready to take care of coir
lege students.

It seems hardly fair to dismiss
all classes and close all offices
on campus and expect the li-
brarians and workers at the Un-
ion to work on through. They,
may also wish to attend chapel
and should be given the privi.
lege to do so just as everyone
else on campus is given this
privilege. .

Grinnell is founded on the
belief “that Christian education
(is) an essential ingredient in
the development ot a good so-
ciety . . . " Though it is indeedl
a “liberal" school as Merle
points out, its liberalism has a
very deiinite pattern. The feel—
ing that no one should be re—
quired to go to chapel ought to
include the notion also that no
one should be prevented from
going.
