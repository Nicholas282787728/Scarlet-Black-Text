“John S. Nolien, in his “History of Grinnell College,”-
remarks that the ‘organ is recognized by competent

artists as one of the finest instruments of its kind in

the Middle West.’ ”

Early in the century, daily
chapel made Herrick one of the
most familiar buildings on cam-
pus. But now, iew students know
what it contains. Once a daily sight
for students, the towering facade
pipes of the organ on the south side
of the chancel today only "C,
casmnally attract notice.

A series ofinstrurnents has filled
this place. On January 15, 1908, the
SdtB reported that the organ had
arrived for the chapel, then only a
few years old. Professor H. W.
Matlack, previously director of
music at the college, helped to
secure the organ, a demonstration
model. As head at the Lyon and
Healy Co. Organ Department, he
gave Grinnell the olier for an
organ “built to demonstrate the
firm’s ability and almost an exact
fit for the space reserved in the
Chapel . . .The instrument will be
one of the best in Iowa, and will be
a great addition to the chapel
exercises. The cost oi the organ,
made especially tor the chapel,
would have been about $10,000; but
as the lirrn is retiring from
business the olier ol $5,000 was
made.”

The college sought a donor and
on January 22, 1908, the 5&8 ans
nounced, “The donor is A. B.
Terril, one of the prominent and
public spirited citizens oi Man-
Chester, lowa.”_ Theorgan, was
being given as a memoriai to his
daughter. Miss Lillian L. Terril. By
February 8, the organ was being
played at chapel and was officially

A 1940 gift of $7,500 allowed for
the building of a new organ with
electronneumatic action. At this
time. the console was moved to the
north side oi the chancel. The in-
strument. designed by Keith
Davenport, instructor in organ,
was to contain 41 sets, including
2,159 pipes, with parts salvaged
lrom the previous instrument.

the chapel. This time the college
opted to start completely from
scratch and called in the famous
Aeolianskinner Company. During
the previous decade a new
philosophy in organ building had
developed. the Classic Tradition.
Ralph Downes. designer of the
Royal Festival Hall Organ in
London, describes the need for
than e:

“ e design of the typical organ
of the period 1900-1950 was almost
reducible to ruleofthumb: you
had your Loud Stops and your Solt
Stops, your Imitative Tone-
Colours, all usually grouped in
clusters on the various manual
sections . . . .The loud and Very
Loud stops devoured (or shouted
down) the rest. The Pedal division
played by the organist’s feet was
largely ‘borrowed' from the
manual divisions so as to provide a
‘suitable’ basis for any tonecolourl
Before the age of pure electronics,
such organs oiten served as mere
‘soundcilects’~ machines rather
than trueinstruments oimusic: for
the organs oi tradition, and
especially of the Golden Age (the
17th and 18th centuries in Europe)
were not conceived or made in this
“EL,

G. Donald Harrison, president of
the Aeolian-Skinner Company,
designed the present Herrick
organ, Hewas one of the pioneers
in the new- “Classic Tradition” to
make organs representative of the

‘earlier tonalities.

The currentorgan, built at a cost
ioi’ over $40,001), has 66 ranks con-
taining 3554 pipes in 5 divisions on a
manuals and pedals. and is
currently valued between $250,000
and $350,000. It was donated by
College president Samuel N.
Stevens and his wife in memory oi
their parents. John S. Nollen, in his
History of Grinnell College,
remarks that the “organ is
recognized by competent artists as
one of the finest instruments of its
kind in the Middle West."

The instrument is important tor
several reasons Normally, an
organ designer would have
restrictions put on him by the
customer. But in this case.
Harrison, the leading organ
designer in America of the mid
century, was restricted only by the
size of the room. He was able to
construct what he considered to be
an ideal instrument.

Secondly, the organ remains one
oi his most successful in-
struments; it exists just as he left
it. It is one of the only Harrison
organs that has not been rebuilt at
a later date.

The organ was dedicated on
Thursday, May 19, 1949, mm Virgil
Fox as organist. Performed at that
time was the Grinnell Fanfare for
Organ and Brass, a work written
by composer Henry Cowell for the
occasion. ~
