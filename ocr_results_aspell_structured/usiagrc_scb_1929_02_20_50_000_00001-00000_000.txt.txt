Quartet Heralded
Here And Abroad

Famous Flonza-ley Group To Be
Here In Early Part of March.

Tile Flonzaley quartet, which uill
ill‘riear here on March 5 as a mim-
her an the school of music recital
course, may saiely be said to be the
only organization of its kind holding
supreme rank both in Europe and
America. It is interesting to note that
each season tllis uuartct is forced
to decline almost as many engager
merits as it accepts, because of the
rule of the organization that it der
vote as much time to rehearsal as to
public performance,

The high standing of the Flonzaley
quartet is ascribed largely 3c the
agreement of its members to confine
tlleir public musical aetir ics exclllr
sively to this one field of endeavor.
None of tile members can bc secur-
ed for individual appearance, nor do
they teach or engage in any other
pursuit except that of the ciillivniion
of string quartet music.

l Mr. Brailsford has published three
books dealing constructively with the

Scientists Discuss

Research On Ears

Henlphill, Jay, McKenzie Talk Of
Findings of Zoology Lab.

"Tile jelly fish is the lowest type
of animal with any sort of hearing
apparatus,” said Marlin Heniphill to
the science club Monday evening, in—
troducing the subject of uEars."

A simple audilory apparatus, more
for equilibrium than hearing is found
in mollusks, ahnclids and flat worms.
The lobster wcars an "ear” on his
tail, the crayfish on his first antel‘h
nae.

The middle ear first appears in the
amphibians; the miter ear in the revs
tiles. Thc hearing of fishes is i-iidh
nicnlary, but they show the three
scm circular canals for equilibrium
that are also prominent in human
cars.

Edith Jay followed Miss Helnphill
with a talk on thc functions of sharks
cars, illustrating it by models that
have been made in tile Grinnell zo-
olugy laboratory in connection with
Prof or Noriiss researches. “Heap
iiig is not greatly developer! in
slim 5 Miss Jay explained. “The ear
reacts to pressure and to states of
equilibrium, as well as to auditory
stimuli," Miss Jay outlined the rcsults
of some recent experiments with
sharks' cars, showing their relation
to pressure and equilibrium.

"Windows in Rabbits' Ear

small square on tile rabbits ear is
clipped and washed, and the car any
esthetized. A square of skin ' rcnicv-

story of that Contest might be some-

Grinnell five pulled up in second

The score was 22 to 21.

decidedly superior to the St. Louis
team in every department. Two shots

another!

The battle started slow, with llelill-

FROSH CAGERS TO
PLAY HENELY HIGH

in accordance with the perm sioil
granted at the last Missouri Valley
meeting, the Grimlell freshman bas-
ketball squad will play its first game
Saturday night when it meets the
Grinucll high school quintet at the
high school.

The high school team, which lot]
the Central iuwa lligll scllnolloop
throughout the early part of the
season, is still pushing the leaders
and should give the prep shooters a
haillo. The game “ill stal‘tat 7:30
and an admission charge of 25 Cents
will he charged. Semester fees will
not admit.

The prep squad has been showing
somc good work Iluder iho’futclagc
of Coach Watt and Won the inter-
class tourney hands down, The men
included are Nielsen, Grant, Melly
rath, Cantrell, Murray and Sharp,
forwards: McCreary, Tllomis, Arms—
smith and Cllristulfersen, guards and

vaded the Des Moines stronghold of
the Bulldogs and were unflattering-
ly handled by Coach Bill Enelter‘s
men. The result was far from satis—
factory to the Pioneers however, and
tonight's game should be the high
spot on the local Court calendar.

The Pioneers will go up against one
of the fincst pair of guards in the
conference in Barnes and Monahan.
Thc latter was outstanding in the de-
feat of the Pioneers in January, and
the scarlet lcani will avoid entitngle~
nlents with [his star in tonight's
game. In king, Dawes and Modccr
Coach Eoelter possesses a sweet trio
of scorers. In the former game, King
was able to garner seven baskets, due
in a great part to some brilliant long—
rang shooting. Bowes, a veteran,
was a strong performer, also.

Van Koten, slumpy center for the
Bulldogs, is a high jumper, and in
addition a polenlial scorer. In the re
cent southern invasion of the Drake
squad, Vail Koren was leading scorer,
and everywhere hailed as one of
tile finest pivot men to perform in
that territory all season. Humphrey
and McCully, Pioneer jumpers, will
have a tough assignment in covering
tllis player.

Captain chgcshall
perform brilliantly tonight for the
Pioneers as the locals attempt to
repeat their victory of last season on
the home flour against the Bulldogs.
Coggcshall was in far from good Cour
dilion when the two teams last met,
and his performance at that time was
far below par. He will be paired with
Delong, lngram or Minier in the start-
ing line-up.

The fine play of Douglas on the
southern trip indicates that the Ce-
dar Rapids boy will probably draw a
guard assignment for tonight's bait-
tie. His running mate will undoubtr
edly be rail, who is expected to play
his usual high-speed game.

The game will undoubtedly attract
the largest crowd of the season. The
doors will open at 7:00, with the op—
ening whistle at 1:30.
