A Happy Medium

If any restrictions are to be placed upon the times at
which tests are scheduled, those restrictions must be en—
forced or they will be ignored Such restriction and subse-
quent enforcement earl only came about through faculty
action. Indicating the necessity of such action were the
tests given the day after the Shearing concert, supposedly
an All-college event, and those being given the day the
students leave for Christmas vacation

There is no necessity to analyze Thursday’s tests;
they are over and the students either attended the concert
and did poorly on the tests or stayed home and studied and
let their investment in the college social fund go down the
drain. The tests scheduled for Dec. 19 are another matter
for they can still be avoided.

It is ridiculous to assume that students can participate
in college planned or condoned Christmas events, including
the formal and the church serw‘ces; pack their clothes and
ready their rooms for the vacation, and still make a good
showing on an exam.

Not only will their grades be an unfair and inaccurate
exaluation of their abiilties (it is a proven fact that at such
times, the student is, at his psychological worst) but they
will be forced into a brief hour or two of intensive cram-
ming, thus losing what some believe to be the most import-
ant part of testing: the learning that goes on in prepara-
tion. A test as a part of the total learning process and as
an incentive for comprehensive review, should certainly
be administered when the student is in a position to gain
something from it.

There are two alternatives to the problem Either the
faculty and the administration, acting jointly, should abolish
large—scale extra—curricular activities, thus allowing com-
plete concentration upon the academic, and in the process
transforming Grinnell from a community to a sterile insti-
tution; or testing schedules should be revised to accomos
date such situations as Convocation, Hell week, All-college
nights or days immediately prior to vacations. There is no
need, of course for consideration of every social and extra-
curricular activity on campus.

This is not to suggest that studies should be subord-
inated to the extra—curricular, for the prime goal of the
college student is to learn. The college must however reach
some degree of consistency in its coordination of the various
anajéir events and responsibilities impinging upon the stu-

Howe Studies Shearing Jazz;
Finds Dixie Elements Missing

By Richard Howe
Music
.In the past twenty years, jazz media have undergone a
variety of mentamorphoses, some of which have been so
tangential as to scarcely resemble their original forms. The
particular style revealed by George Shearing Wednesday
night is among the most notable attempts to create a dis—
tinctly sophisticated jazz idiom in the “supper club" tra-

dition. Shearing’s approach abandons the more primitive ele-

Just before they left, the szaii

of the cacophony, which in the
old Dixieland style was largely
due to simultaneous improvisa-
tion, is not found in Shearing's
rather refined version.

To what extent Shearing and

a matter of definition. Their
