“pants"l by the members of Ritalin Test squad in
one ofmany comedy “games" they played during a
Saturdayenight performance in Gardner lounge.

Dressed in plain white T—shirts and blue jeans,
the members ofRitalin don’t stand out—elaborate
eostuming isn't necessary The troupe has one goal
in mind: humor,

First things ﬁrst

Ritalin is eomposed ofia members. “it's a bit
large as [far as} imptov groups go.” troupe totapt
tain NickWagner ‘02 said, “but i think we’ve got a
solid group. "

The group iormed in the
fall of199o because there
wasn't an improv troupe on
campus. A ”handful of
people who found each
other" made up the original
troupe, said Wagner.

The troupe utilizES a
wide range ofoomedie tech»
niques. “We have a few
games that are r . . built
around one»lin:ts," co.eap.
tain [Aurel] OrndorE‘OZ exA
plained. “We do quick
jokes, [and] we do long. exe
tended, drngvout situ-
ational comedy things,"

They also utilize a variety of eomedie “games"
during their performances—[hey have alist ofover
60, in fact. “Some of the games are old [lmprovl
standards, and some of them are use [inventions]
ofthe people in me troupe." omdoriifsaid.

These mmes can go anywhere, leading to truly
bizarre scenes.

Orndorffand Wagner serve as captains ofrhe
troupe, but they stress the democratic nature ofail
decisions. ”Our only job is to focus the energy
[and] get people on the same page," said Wagner.
This way, everyone else in the troupe can “let their
creative energies ﬂow" while Wagner and OrndorFf
worry about “funneling" that energy into a specific

goal.
Why improv’?

There are many reports for involvement in
Ritalin. The troupe gives Wagner, a theatre major,
"extra practice at being on stage in an unscripted
nunncri"

There are other benefits as well. “llt's a] great
way to be creative with the aid of other people,"
Wagner said. “it's really like playing make-believe
[as] a child.

“When you're up on stage, you can create a
world out almost seemlsl real. sometimes I've
forgotten whether something happened in real
life [or on stagcl.”

lmprov also encountges group eooperation
and communication To build a strong anti
funny scene, the group has to know and work
closely with one another, “In order for it to
work, everyone has to agree [on] the world
that you’re playing in," Wagner explained,

"it’s Just like when you were kids."

”When [improv'is] at its
best is when evewone's to-
tally into what’s happening
[in] the moment and not
thinking about trying to be
funny or trying to call at-
tention to themselves. It’s
about support."

— Nick Wagner ’02

Improv is Fun

The members ofRitalin get along well and have
run performing together on and off the stage, said
the captains. Positive interaction between the

troupe members is one ofthe primary benefits of.

involvement, Wagner and omdorlfagreed, “1 look
forward to [practice] every week," said Wagner.

Wagner and omelorli also enjoy the satisfac.
tion ofa job well clone. “1 think the best part [of
improv] is when you do a good some or you see
somebody else do a good scene," said orndorfh
“it makes all the times when you try to be funny
and struggle with it so much more [worthwhile]
when something comes together,"

This isnt always easy, “The times when it re.
ally works are the times when we're not consciously
trying to be funny—when people just fully col-n-
mit to and believe in everything that's going on
[on stagel,” said Wagner. “Then you get those out—
rageous situations, but people are acting in them as
though they're actually happening Tlirit's when
humor happens,

“You know as an audience member when
someone’s trying to be funny, and it's usually just
painful," he continued. “When [improv is] at its
best is when everyone's totally into what's happcne
ing [in] the moment and
not thinking about trying
to be funny or trying to call
anention to themselves. it’s
about support."

And hard work too

It's no surprise, then.
that one ofthe harden parts
of impiov for Wagner oc.
curs when he “removes
himself' from ascene. This
happens when he looks at
theseene from the perspec»
tive of an audience mem-
her and feels that it’s not
goinganywhere. “Youstart
feeling like the seene is not
funny at all and um no one would find [it] enter»
raining," he said, “and then it gets worse, [because]
you're not having fun anymore,”

improv is dependenton havingalotofenergy.
sairl Wagner, and it's diiftcult to be liiglieencrgy all
the time. “sometimes the whole group dynamic
enters [a] slump, this low energy place, and were
like zombies on smgc,” he said. “[Tlhat's no fun
for anyone."

And sometimes, in a group where the goal is
fun, it's hard to find the balance between play and
accomplishment. “This eouidveryeasily be agroup
orpeople who get together and play," otndorffsaiel,
“but we also really try to improve as improv-ers
and ermtivc thinkers,

“We have to balance laughing hysterically and
bzvlng : lot offun with looking at our scenes cnll-
cally and questioning what we could do better."

“Sometimes it's not so much fun to have to
critique each other and go over imptov exercises,"
Wagner said, “but refining outskills and being self»
ciitital [make] theseonts better to Watch and [more
fun] to be in as well."

This involves focus that is sometimes lacking.

“[The general problem offocusi is amplified in a
group of funny people who get together specifi.
cally to be nanny," Wagner said. “(Peoplei feel mm-
pelled to make smart—assed remarks about every/e
thing that happens. Anytime anyone says anything
during piactice, you get a ripple of13 outer witty
comments on what was said," This understand.
ably slows down progress.

Dispitc all this, the troupe manages to survive
and prosper—and even to have fun.

Practice makes perfect

“People always laugh at me when l-say I’m go.
ing to improv practice because it's
[counterintuirive]," Wagner said. But practioe is
imponant, even for iinprov.

Ritalin practices twice per week for 1.5 hours.
During practice. they run through exercises focus.
ing on basic improvisational skills—how to listen,
how to build relationships how to create games
within larger scenes, and how to create an imag.
ined world. They also work on becoming com-
fortable with the other members ofthe troupe and
with rhe different game formm while still being
spontaneous.

“it‘s so important to know the other people in
the troupe well, both as people and as improveis,"
said Sarah Aswell ‘03. ”A good scene comes out of
knowing the other pcﬁoniknowing what they'll
say, how they'll reset, and, most importantly, knowt
ing that they know the same things about you. It
gets to the point where you’re tonlly comfortable
on stage; 11 other people have got your back."

one game the troupe plays during practice is
“straight Face,“ in which troupe members at.
tempt to make one another laugh in the con.
text ofan improv scene. Tire game is more
than just fun—it helps members learn
how to stay in eharaeter during a ’
stone, so that they an stay in char»
acter and won’t break down
laughing when they are pre.
seiited With and asked to
react to strange scene
situations.

Audience involvement

Audienoes playan important role during Ritalin
performances. “We really like having audienees,"
said Wagner. Ritalin has their best performanots
when the audienee is “into what’s going on," said
Wagner, those times “when we ask for a suggestion
[and] it's yelled out immediately."

However, both orndorfr and Wagner wish
there was more audience involvement in petfore
manees. Now. the troupe ocuslonally ads for sugt
gestions From the audience, Wagner said. Ideally,
Wagner would like to do things in whidi the audit
ence was more physiully involved. “I’d like to have
the shows... tompletely encompass the audience,"
he soitl.

The problem with this? “A lot orthe people in
the troupe are actually shy people,” Wagner eat.
plarned. "We have relatively few theater people or
people who have stage experience. "

ornrlorifseoonded this, saying the troupe has
“issues with people."

Looking ahead

The troupe holds auditions in the fall, Orndorﬂ‘
said, People from all classes participate in these
auditions. “[Auditions are] basically a practice
where everyone iust comes to have fun," she said.
“[We) try not to stress the pressure ofauditioning
for the group."
