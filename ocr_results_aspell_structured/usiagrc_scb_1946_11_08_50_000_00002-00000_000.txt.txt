Another series of Gates lectures has come
to a close. This year's speaker, Dr, Arnold Nash,
has returned to the McCormick Theological, Semr
many in Chicago after a short, but busy, stay on
the Grinnell campus, during which he succeeded
in starting a good many discussions Some stir
dents have been confirmed in their beliefs, others
confounded, and, perhaps some have been cons
fused—although they may not admit it.

All that is as it should be. Since its beginning,
many years ago, the aim of the prnJCct has been
just that, the reorientation of Christian think-
ing to the problems of today's world This means
that tradition must be reevaluated in the light
of changing conditions. Neither a resume nor a
discussion of the lectures will be made in these
columns; that is the problem and duty of each
individual who heard the lectlll‘esibut it brings
up a very significant point.

For the lectures, although voluntary. were
well attended in every case. That is not to deny
that more students could have gone and un-
doubtc i should have gone There was still room
for iinpr.ovement

Nevertheless enough students did attend vols
untarily to vindicate the college's policy of not
compelling attendance, And this attendance, by
its nature, is evidence of Wide interest on the
campus in the question of religion. Regardless of
what individual decision on this question may be,
thi isplay was, to say the least, exceedingly

gr tifying.
