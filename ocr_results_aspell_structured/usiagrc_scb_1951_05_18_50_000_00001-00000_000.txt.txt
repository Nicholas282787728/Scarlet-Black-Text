Prof Knocks ‘Sw
24 Siurlenls Hon

In the convocation program
Thursday morning at Darby
Gym, M. Neal Klausncr
(philosophy) gave an address
administering the “shock treat-
ment in education." In a
straightforward manner Dr.
Klausner presented the facts
which led him to believe that
students have become “docile,
lacking in self-determinat- n."
He quoted Carlyle who dess
cribed/ them as " . sitting
like buckets waiting to be
filled. . Dr. Klausner blamed
professors, over abundance of
extra curricular activities, and
hero worship of the athletes
for the state of mind of the
average student, and broughti a
round of applause from the
audience when he called the
athletes the "sweater boys of
America."

Urges nationality

He' urged students to acquire
some degree ot rationality and
warned that if they couldn‘t
make up their minds, they
would be made up for us. He
accused them of turning from
Gadflles. such as Socrates, to
Gadabouts lacking individual—
ism and rationalism.

He urged that students
needle their professors
more, “not for the sake of
watching his mind in ac—
tion, but for getting yours
into action."

The job of the teachers ‘is
to help the students attain i‘a»
tional self determination”, Mr.
Klausner stated.
