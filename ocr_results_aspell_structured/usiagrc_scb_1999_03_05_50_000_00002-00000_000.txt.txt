I remember how rhe Minneapolis
paper described The Thief. “A movie
in which beauriful people do ugly
rhings." Weleomo ro Russia, If you
have a weak spirir, don'r see rhis
movie. ,_

Both Twin Ciry papers gave rhe
him very low rarings. The only orher
descriprive nore I recall was one re.
view calling Tire T/rr'ef‘a senrimenral
srory abour rhe relarionship herween
fathers and sons." The reviewer cauld
nor have been more wrong, bur in a
sense he was on rhe righr rraek: a srory
abour rhe relarionship berween rhe
Farher and his devasrared people, Fa-
ther Stalin.

Who were His people? Russia losr
most (50 I’ve been told) oFits able bode
ied men during WWII (iusr afrer
which rhe movie rakes place).

The rhiefappears in a milirary uni-
form, and rhus is received wirh Lespect
and grarirude by rhose who surround
him. He appears as a “war man,” as
rhey say in Russia. It is nor so signifi-
cant whether he is acrually returning
from rhe war or wherhcr he has only
ehosen rhis uniform as his disguise;
imporranr is rhar he undersrands how
people will see him, and knows how
ro manipulare rheir awe of him. He
also knows how ro show rhe psycholr
ogy ofone who has been ro war, as in
one scene when he bangs his chesr.
poinring ro rhe rarroo ofSraIin over
his heart (not an uncommon tattoo
for men at [his time to have: so be»
holden ro and loving was rhe narion
ofits leader).

And rhe heroine: In a eounrry
where men fighr and die, women en»
dure. Perhaps rhis is a far more miscr»
able plight. The suffering of rhis
woman (of Russian women then, of
many now) was huge: Dependanr on
an absenr man, hardly living, bur Surv
viving, she raises one ofrhe next gen.
eration Russians. Her (ask is momis
mental. She has no choice but to ens
dure. To her, rhe rhief is nor only a
lover, bur a rare opporruniry: a "war
man," prorecrion and supporr.

Who was He? Forger cveryrhing
you’ve ever heard about Stalin and
consider what lie meant to the Rus»
sian people at the end OFWWII. Stalin
was himself seen as 2 “war man,” a
proud and uncompromising figure—

Diaz movie already rhis semesrer.
Whar is wirh this Cameron Diaz obs
session? Wirh rhar said, I really
liked rhis movie. I will admir rhar I
cried rhrough almosr rhe whole
movie. lrhink ir just hir roo close
ro home. Skinny blond chick ver-
sus rhe obviously herrer red head 7
srory ofmy life. The plor may have
been‘a lirrle seerhrough, bur I
rhoughr it was'weilractcd, so it
didn’t really marrer ifyou knew whar
was going ro happen in rhe end.
Once again, lwas jusr enjoying ihe
ride.

A: Two weeks, rwo movies
courrney has enjoyed. lrhink rhe
pressure of midsems has finally
rouched her in rhe head. However,
I’ve gor ro agree wirh her. This
movie packs enough hilariry ro keep
everyone sarisfied. It’s marvelously
acred, and Julia Roberrs finally gers
back so rhe rype of role rhar firsr
won her acclaim e smarr, roinanric
comedies.

C: so rrue, Aaron. She rorally
becomes rhe woman rhar you love

as much so as Morher Russia herself.
He was srrengrh and hope incarnare.
lnanarionso lacking in farhers, Sralin
srands ahead, rhe sole prorecror. This
rime has nor been forgorren by rhe
Russian people. Russians refer ro
WWII as “The Great Earherland War
ofrhe sovier People Againsr rhe Ger»
man Fascisr Aggressors.”

Consider rhe war from rheir per.
specrive: Hirler and Stalin had a paer:
Hirler broke ir, invaded: Ciries were
destroyed; innumerable people died;
horrible suffering followed. Russians
believe rhar rhey are responsible for
ﬁnally ending rhe war, for rhe defear
oinrler—pcrhaps simply due ro rhe
degree ofrheir loss.

Once, ralking wirhsome Russians
I had just mer over a horde ofvodka,
one menrioned he had heard rhar
Americans claim ro have earned rhe
vicrory rhemselves, lsaid I had heard
rhar Russians think of rhemselves as
rhe winners. Wirh a sudden glinr of
anger in his eye, rhe man looked ar
me and said: “You don't need to have
heard it. You need ro know it."

While in Russia lasr spring, Ivi:»

rhar rhe Soviers finally wonibut nor
before every srrucrure in rhe ciry had

where rhc worsr of rhe barrle rook
place srands a monumenr, “Morhcr
Russia,“ similar ro the srarue ofLiba
erry except rhar she srands arraeking,
a srone sword held high above her
head.

Near rhe monumenr is a circular
building; wirliin, gold colored walls
covered wirli rhe names ofr'lie barrlc’s
Russian dead4-reﬂeet rhe lighr ofan
erernal flame, held by a huge srone
hand. I visired rhis monumenr for rhe
hrsr rime alone and ar night. Walking
inro rhe building, expccring norhing
of rliis magnirude, l felr I was in a
remple. I was more irnpacred by rhis
rhan I have been on enrrance inro any
orher religious building

All rhrough rhe Russian rememe
branee ofWWll runs an elemenr of
praerically religious venerarion. No
eemeieryl visired, no clry (no nrarrer
how small), lacked a monuinenr ro rhe

ro hare. Aerually, orher people
mighr have hared her 7 I iusr
thought she was being prelty damn
clever. Ruperr Evererr was fabulous
as well. Anyrime he showed up,
somerhing funny was bound ro hap-
pen.

A: For ilie firsr rime in our pro-
fessional careers, I rhink Courrney
and I have reached a consensus.
Somebody check ro see whar ski
passes are selling for in Hell, This
movie has all rhe ingredienrs for a
fun rime — greae acrors in grear roles,
clever siruarions, and a car chase. I
think ir should be one of rhe berrer
arrended Harris movies so far.

The Thief by Sev Oman

mentsidespite Russia's chronic lack
ofmoriey.

In Russia currenrly, “The Day of
rhe Defendersofrhe Fatherland," also
know as “The Day of rhe sovier
Army," is a very celebrared holiday.
Besides greering all rhe vererans in
one’s life, a morher will congrarulare
her youngesr son on this day, because
he roo will serve as a Defender ofrhe
Farherland. (I wrire this wirh a well.
ing ofinspirarion in my ehesr, and al-
mosr a reariin awe ofrhis amazing
Russia rhar does nor forger (as we do);
and, rhar carries irs burdens wirh more
digniry rhan rhe mostAmcricans ever
could, were we faced with even re.
morely as difficulr rimes as rhey were
rhen, as rhey are now.)

Unforrunarely rhe final minures
have been cur from che version of Tire
T/rrefreleased in Amerieaeseenes of
rhe ehild as a grown man.

On rhe chance rhar our version
will nor be our you may wane ro skip
rhis paragraph. How rhe hlm ends:
Now a high ranking i-i-iiliuty oilioer,
a “war man" of rhe war in Afghani-
sran_he srumbles upon a very old,
bearded man who liesuddenly rhinks
may be rhe rhief lusr afrer rhe old man
dies, rhe boy _ now an officer - dis-
covegs rbar he was wrong. However,
his convicrion rhar rhe rhiefmay srill
be living (rhough he shor him as a
boy) comes from a sense of guilr he
has felr since boyhood: regardless of

me rhief having become such a den >

elicr, he killed one ofRussia's few men.
Sashaboardsarrain,similarrorheone
on which he and his morher mer rhe
rhieffor rlie ﬁrst rime. In rhe rrain car
he sees anorher single morher, hold-
ing a child. I feel rhar rhis image-
similar ro so many Orthodox icons 1
have seen of Mary holding rhe baby
Jesus—could almosr be a symbol of
Russia’s pasr, and presenr.

Whar more do I have re say? The
T/Ji'efls aehingly eroric_ir will woo
you and make you cringe, as violenr
as p05t»\X/\X/II Russia was (as in some
ways, srill is), and painful ro wareh.
You will rremble on rhe edge ofyour
sear. If you're paying arrenrion, you
will be srabbed ro your soul.

Leave yourAmerican framing be.
