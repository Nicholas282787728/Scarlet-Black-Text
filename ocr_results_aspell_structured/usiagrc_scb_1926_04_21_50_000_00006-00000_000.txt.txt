There is a time in crery lll‘mi’s ctlucntiou when he
arrives at the conviction that cnry is ignorance; that
irritation is suicide; that he must take himself for better
for worse as his portion; that though the uidc unherse
is iull oi good, no kernel or nourishing corn can come to
him but through his toil bestowed on that plot oi ground
which is given to llilu to iilli The power uhich resides
in him is now in nature, and nonc but he knows what
thut is which he cnu do, nor does lie know until he has
tried. ~Rulph Wulﬂo Emerson.
