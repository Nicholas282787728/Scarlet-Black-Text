Progressive Student Network Conference Held

by Karry Kooii

I attended the Progressive Stur
dent Network tPSN) conference
entitled. “Rewriting the Script:
Deieating Reagan and
Reaganism in 1984 and Beyond"
in Philadelphia last weekend. I at-
tended conferences on the topics
oi disarmament, Reaganomics.
and violence against women.

At the disarmament workshop.
we discussed various ways that
students can work towards a more
peaceiul world. Announcements
were made about specific events.
such as the midswestern Freeze
italiy in Chicago on October it.
and the anti-patriarchy woman's
action in NYC in November. call-
ed “Not in our Names." We also
discussed the advantages oi a
multi-issue. multistactic approach
such as that used by Mobilization

Understanding conservative

Grinnell.” 1 just wish they'd live

This explains —- in part — why
leftists and liberals have not yet
seen a good conservative argu-

explanation is that no good can

lor Survival. One student deSCribs
ed an action at Brown University
that was causing muchcontrover-
cy: 700 students there signed a
petition requesting the college to
stockpile cyanide capsules at the
college health center in case oi
nuclear war. The publicity and
discussion generated by this peti-
tion was incredible.

The second workshop I attend
ed. called "Economics ior Real
Folks." was a lecture/discussmn
led by an econojournalist. while
Reagan'ssupplyrside economics
has indeed lowered inflation and
beneiited many people in the short
term. his deficit is enormous.

Conservatives have to be much
more rigorous than their counter
parts; otherwise their opinions
will be treated as so much git)»
berish.
bably have to settle toi‘ little gains
- their audience is too critical.

Conservatives should present
their basic values to the \\ hole stu-

speciiic issues. honrconsei‘vatives
have to understand where they
are coming train,

or. it they're careiul. they can

speaker described the ideology ol
Reaganomics as “be greedy" and

spreading. and should be oi con»

The third and last Workshop I
attended was entitled “Violence

A moderate
proposal

.'l'0 the Editor:

Although Grinnell College and
its students have yet to gain
renown for our reactionary
tendencies. the time has arisen tor
us to consider a referendum taken
at Bruvin University. This
referendum authorized the stu-
dent health center to stock a supp-
ly of cyanide capsules [or use in
the event ot a nuclear attack.
Their rationale in doing so was to
avoid the agony ot a death by
radiation poisoning. due to the
fallout of the weapons, Perhaps it
is time of Grinnell to consider
some Similar measures. i

The Reagan Administration has
put iorth the proposal that all or
the communities in America be
supplied with "enough shovels to
go around.‘ in order to build the
appropriate shelters. The
students at Grinnell might desire
to accept this gracious oiier.

ll. however. we choose to
prepare ourselves in a diiierenl
manner. there are other alter~
natives to agony. Since the city oi
Grinnell (and probably

tollows that we will be nowhere

Charges violence and sexism
encouraged by Risque party

To the Editor:

I was extremely upset about the
advertising used on campus ior
Norris Hall's "Risque Business"
party. The advertising. which por-
trayed a woman next to a man
with a gun saying. “Never say
‘never‘ to a man behind a gun."
and billed the party as a ” ‘dress
to get laid' party". encourages an
attitude that is all too prevalent in
our society. i.e. that objectifica-
tion of and violence towards
women is “tun."

Kapes on college campuses are
not terribly uncommon. Two
years ago at the University ol
Pennsylvania. a violrlan who had
taken four hits of LE 1). and was
very drunk was carried upstairs
by a group of iraternity brothers
who proceeded to take turns have
ing sex with her. Later. they brags
