Outside the bubble

However, not everyone on campus is so proactive about
making Grinnell a more accepting place, Despite the op-
timism and commitment Barrios-Camacho observed in
her group's discussion, she acknowledged that those are
tending the forum may not have been representative of
the campus as a whole.

“How can you actually reach out to the students that
weren’t theIe?" said Barrios-Camacho.

To deal with this challenge, Bernal intends to send
our campussvode emails and post information on the
Grinncll website regarding suggestions made in response
to the results of the assessment.‘

“ifthere are groups that have started to gather...[and
produce] new ways to think about this, we want to share
that with the entire community." Bernal said.

Many people feel that the ability to deal With issues
such as these is a part of how Grinnell 'dcﬁnes itself.

For Burrows. this process, is "honoring the commits
ment we made to ourselves and sticking to our core values
and social justice,"he said

forum. She observed the desire to create
change on a personal level, as Rankin had
suggested.

“All of the students in my group felt like itwas their
personal role and responsibility to make the campus bet-
ter,” Barrios-Camacho said.

Professor Justin Thomas, Theater, has already begun
to realize this process. He led a discussion of the campus
climate assessment in his tutorial class, clarifying some of
the data released and encouraging discussion.

Thomas mentioned in particular the number of unre-
ported cases of sexual assault—or those who responded to
the survey, nearly 30 percent of those who responded said
they had been sexually assaulted—and the general diss
comfort expressed by many staff members about how they
were treated due to their place in the Grinneli hierarchy.

“The reality is this is our community,” Thomas said,
"We live here, we eat here, many of usithe students—
sleep here, we work here and we need to intentionally cres
ate the kind orcommunity that we want to have."

World Headlines

- A draft obtained by The Associated Press on Thursday
illustrates commitment by world leaders to a new hunger
ﬁghting strategy world leaders would pledge to increase
agricultural development aid in order to help the world’s
1 billion hungry people obtain food. Hunger currently
affects 1.02 billion people globally due to ﬁnancial melt-
down, high food prices, drought and war. some humani-
tarian groups believe that the document was weak and
that the three day Rome summit would fail if the world
leaders involved do not allocate new resources and create
mechanisms to hold governments to their commitments.
The draft is missing speciﬁc money commitments, such
as the $44 billion in aid that the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization states needs in the next ,
few decades. Ofﬁcials hope to have the draft approved
by attending leaders on the ﬁrst day of the summit at the
United Nations organization's headquarters.
