Second Contest by a
Large Score.

0n \Varrl held Thursday al'ternoon
occur-red the n'rst regular ball game
oi the season and much to the sub
prise or all, Grinnell scored a victory.
About one hundred loyal fans saw
the wearers or the scarlet and black
trim Warner’s Grays t0 the tune of
5 to 3.

Smithson was on the slab [or the
locals and the south paw from Minne»
seta held the upper hand at all times.
He struck out iour men and allowed
onlysix bits which were far enough
apart to keep the score down. He
also made an enviable record at. the
bat, securing a single and a two bagh
ger, the latter bringing in two scores.

The team delded well and support-
ed their pitchers in good shape. Davis
did good work at center, capturing
several long hits.

At batting Grinneli showed up
stronger than was anticipated and at
no time did they have trouble in ﬁnd-
ing the ball~ Only three strike-outs
were recorded against them.

Marshalltown played a consistent
game throughout but did not come up
to the standard or a league team.

CARNEGIE LIBRARY OPENED.

The Books Have Been Transferred
to the Splendid, New
Building.

AILer several months delay, the
new library building made possible
by the generosity oi the steel magnate
is at last occupied, and on Tuesday
morning the doors were thrown open
tothe students. Librarian Douglass
and ascore oi assistants spent their
vacation in moving boolis and at the
present time the old building is prac-
tically deserted, there being only a
few hundred books which were not
catalogued left on the shelves. These
will be removed as soon as possible.
The new building is certainly a
“thing or beauty” and «oughtto be a
"joy iorever" to the many generations

or students that will come and go.

The reading room occupies the our
tire length or the building on the
second ﬂoor and in this room are the
current magazines and periodicals.
The stack room tor the bound magi»
zines is directly on or the south end oi
the room.

on irorn the main corridor is the
librarians desk and oilice. The stack
room occupies the entire wing or the
main building. This is ﬁre proof
throughout, having cement noor, steel
stacks and steel doors.

Recitation rooms, cloak rooms etc.,
occupy the lirst floor and basement.
The recitation rooms will probably be
ready ior useina short time. to is
expected that the economic classes
will meet there on Monday.

Somewhat stricter rules have been
adopted in the new building. A
requisition at the desk is necessary
ror every book which is taken either-
irom the stack room or reserved shelf,
and the book is to be returned to the
desk, not to the shelves as formerly.
Furthermore all conversation is for»
hidden in the reading room and special
rooms ior visiLing will be provided ror
in the hear [more

Tire building will be lighted with
electricity and will have desk lights
on each table as soon as they can be
installed. The library has not been
open evenings because of this.

In all respects, the ediﬁce is a model
library building and Iowa College has
a library which iew colleges in the
middle west can equal and which none
can surpass.

No exercises were held in connection
with the opening orthc building but
it will be iorrnally dedicated at com-

mencement time when appropriate
exercises will be given.

This lecture was probably the best 01
its kind ever given in Grinnell and
the series of pictures were pronounced
by many to be the best 01 their kind
ever thrown upon Cl. canvass. Profes-
sor Shimek showed how the forests
of America were being destroyed and
means were not [alien for their restor-
ation and by his views, the evils result-
ing rroin this practice, were vividly
put before the audience. The subject
oi trimming trees was also discussed
in detail and [army practical sugges-
tions were given to those present.

After the lecture President and Mrs.
Bradley entertained the Visitors and a
number of college and town Il’iends 2111
their home. Light refreshments were
served and the evening was pleasantly
spent till 1] o‘clock. Friday was taken
up with the reading anrl discussion OI

‘
GRINNELL WINS DEBATE.

neieais Arms in a Most Exciting Coni,
rest. judges Decision 2 to r.

In a great argumentive contest
Grinllell won a victory irorn Ames last
night on the question that the admin~
istrative functions in a city should be
vested in the mayor.

It wassde in the college chapel at
Ames when President Storms appear-
ed on the platiorm and introduced the
chairman or the evening, Supt. J. J.
McConnell of Cedar Rapids, to the
large audience. .

In :1 low ﬁtting words Supt. Mo-
Connell opened the debate and intro-
duced the ﬁrst speaker for the afﬁrm-
ative, Mr. II. H. Wheaten.

Ml'. Wheaten began the debate by
shelving the history and meaning or
the question. Aside from proving
the necessity of the proposed change,
he did very little arguing, but spent
his time in preparing the Way {01‘ his
colleagues. It was time Well spent;
his clear style and convincing deliVA
ery won the attention of the audience.
Once the attention was secured, Mr.
Haley brought Iorth the arguments
which won the debate.

His two main arguments were, lirst,
den'nite' responsibility; second, the tu-
tility or asserting one-man power.
Mr. Riley’s great earnestness rind
minute knowledge or the question
convinced the audience that he had
been entrusted with the chief busi-
ness of the debate and Was there to
attend to it.

Mr. Paul closed the debate for the
ailirmatire. In his main speech
which wash. most excellent piece of
refutation, he blocked all the argu~
Inents of the negative and ﬁnished the
arguments of the ainl'lllzttive. His
leadership of debate was thin. of ct
veteran and to his generalship, proh-
aoly more than to any other-one cause.
was the victory due.

The Allies team was Well balanced,
thoroughly prepared, an d was un-
doubicrlly the strongest team thdt
Gl‘innell has met in years. Their
ciliei’ excellencies were unity of team
w 0 l' 1;, earnestness of delivery and
thoroughness in preparation.

Their defectsas viewed by the af-
Lil'matire, who by the nature of things
could not be impartial judges, were
inability to leave Illeil' Outline and
meet the new and strange arguments
of [he ailil'matire.

The superiority of Gi'innell was
shown in their ability, ﬁrst, to put
Iol‘lh and hold to an issue; second; to
bloc]: n11 uLtelnpts of negative to as
cape that issue. Negative was com-
pelled to meet burdens of proof. In
this last point Grinnell’s extempor-
aneous ability stood her Well. All of
Grinnell‘s rebuttals and the greater
part Of the main Speeches were made
on the spur oi the moment.

Alter the debate a banquet and re»
ceptiou was held in honor of the Vis—
itors. President Storm presided as
toast master. Rev. A. E. Craig, of
Ottumwa, one or the judges, told
“Why They Did It;” Charles Board-
man 0! Grinnell responded to the
toast “How They Did It;” Mr. Paul-
