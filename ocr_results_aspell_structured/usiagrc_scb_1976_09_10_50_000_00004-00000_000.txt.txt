”in your absence . . .

H

“In your absence , , ,” begins the memo from President
Turner detailing his administrative reorganization, This is
an ironic but incisive comment on the action which was taken
this summer, in light of the President's avowed interest in
student and faculty input into all aspects of the College’s
governance. It is hard to believe that the “Position Paper on
the Future of the College” emanated from the same office as
the cut~backs in the student service positions held by
Georgia Dentel and Kathy McClusky.

As perceptively noted in Turner’s “White Paper” Grin-
nell’s geographical isolation inevitably produces a con-
comitant social and cultural isolation. The President further
states that the cost of the concerts and outdoor recreation
programs (among others) are in part justified by this isolated
position. In a move aimed at economy, but without careful
analysis of the present system of scheduling and booking, he
has undermined his credibility in this matter. Accumulating
evidence runs counter to his insistence that the quality of the
film and concert program will not suffer as a result of his
dismissal of Georgia Dentel. <

The “White Paper" further stresses that Grinnell needs to
nurture and maintain a unique identity and distinctiveness.
There is one facet of Grinnell's present uniqueness which Mr.
Turner seems to have overlooked or been unaware of at the
time he decided to reshuffle the social programming
department. This is the pre-eminent place Grinnell holds as
having one of the finest concert series in the US. On an
extremely limited budget, and in spite of our poorly ac-
cessible geographical position, we are rated among the top
five schools in the nation for the quality of the acts Ms.
Dentel’ attracts.

A look at a weekend events calendar from Coe, Carleton, or
Lawrence would quickly convince you that we stand unique
in this area. And in the words of President Turner, “. . i it
behooves us to remember that, in the eyes of a prospective
student, Grinnell is but one among a number of excellent,
small, coeducational liberalrarts colleges—and we are in
direct competition with most of them."

Of great importance in the “Position Paper on the Future”
(in fact a major reason for its existence! is the idea that
students should have some input into the direction the
College takes in the coming years. We believe that the action
taken as it relates to extracurricular activities indeed will
have a major longrterm role in the future of the College. The
students had. no voice in this decision.

Finally, the position paper states unequivocably that, “the
faculty is the living heart of a healthy college.” Late last year
amid reports that Georgia Dentel was being dismissed, more
than a dozen senior faculty members presented themselves
to the administration in defense of Ms. Dentel's job. Ob-
viously their advice and opinions in the matter went
unheeded. In reference to Turner’s “living heart” analogy,
one biology professor remarked that, “the circulation bet-
ween the heart and the 'nether regions of the body is often
very poor.”

To introduce the concerts
program to students who are un-
familiar ivith it would require a
review of a sixteenryearyold
program and would take more
space than the 5&8 has in one
issue We are writing because we
feel there are some issues to“,
cernmg the well-being and future
of the program which we would
like the college community to
become aware of.

The booking industry is complex,
oontusing. and inflated. The
country has hundreds ot artists,
most of whom are beyond the
financial means of Grinnell's
concerts program to engage {or
performance. Why then do we
have a reputation across the
country for being a center for big
acts in a small school? Past years
of concerts at Grinnell have in-
cluded‘ Bruce Springsteen, McCoy
Tyner, Ry Cooder, the Mahavishnu
Orchestra, Roland Kirk, The Heath
Bros. Quintet, I Musici di Roma.
Larry Coryell, Weather Report,
Charles Mingus. and Little Feat

to cover only a small portion oi the
range from popular artists to
southern blues to innovative rock.
We have had but one ‘in’ in |he
booking industry, and that is our
own Georgia Dental. MS. Dentel is
a trained fullrtime activities
counselor who is responsible tor
negotiating each oi the above
artists as well as booking movies,
North Lounge dances and other
Cultural events. In efforts to trim
down “excess fat" from college
expenditure, the administration
recently decided to include Ms,
Dentel’s position in addition to
faculty and administration cuts tor
next year.

What concerns the concerts
committee is the effect Such a Cut
will have on the already popular
concert series It is understood that
the past success of the concerts,
films and dance bands is due
largely to Ms Dentel’s expertise.
We question the optimism of the
administration with regard to a
concert program without Ms.
Dentel,

In a letter to Mr. Turner and Mr.

Walker, a popular recording artist
states, “the selection, contracting,
and production of concerts is much
more detailed and complicated
than it appears . . Ihope that the
college realizes what an cul-
standing program Grinncll has had
through the years and that Georgia
(Dentel) is quite extraordinary in
her urea Georgia has the
knowledge of contemporary music,
artists, and booking which is
necessary to one in her position
She knows how best to go about
obtaining artists and groups
desired and has personal contacts
within the business which help her
be effective in attracting artists of
quality on a limited budget." The
letter is signed by Herbie Hancock
who further states, ”I believe that
this decision (to not renew Ms
Dentel’s contractl would be a
serious mistake which would prove
in the long run to be costly rather
than economical for thecollege .
I believe that Grinnell especially,
being as culturally isolated as it Is
because of its location, would be
tar less attractive to prospective
students and to Students in
residence if it did not offer a
quality program at both concerts
and films, both are factors in a
student's image of the school.”
Hancock's letter is one at many
which unfortunately reached Mr.
Turner's desk Lifter the decision to
make the cut was already made.
Obviously, the concert program is
a drawing card both in terms ot
prospective students and those
already here.

It is with regret that our 0p»
timism towards future concert
programs be more than
guarded, While funds for the
series will remain intact, to reduce
Ms. Dentel's sixteen years of {bills
time work into a part time job with
no contacts and qualification in the
fine arts seems to place little value
on the Continued success of the
program. Artists who rarely play
colleges (setting aside our position
geographically) often shy away
irom exposure in an area which
cannotoffer record promotion. For
instance, ‘I Musict di Roma’, which
was engaged last year, had this to
say concerning their experience at
Grinnell, “As you know, we
hesitate to schedule this celebrated
orchestra outside of the most
prestigous concert halls (oi--
chestra Hall in Chicago, Carnegie
Hall in New York, the Kennedy
Center in Washington, etc.) It was
only through our past experience
with you 1M5. Dentel) that We
dared to risk it "

Grinnell College received free
advertisement in a recent article in
Billboard magazine, Billboard is
undoubtedly one of the most widely
read trade magazines in the music
industry and their recent article
had a protnund impact on artists
and other colleges throughout the
country. Stating that “although
Grinnell (Iowa) College has only
about 1,500 students, it has
assembled one of the best
balanced concert series of the past
decade,” The article further states
that “such a program requires
constant attention, both in regard
to planning, organization, booking
and production, and it needs
protessional supervision to be
Successful ” In addition to being
recognized in this article, Grinnell

College was one of four institutions
whose 1975-76 concert programs
were nominated by Billboard
magazine as the outstanding
collegiate concert series of the
year at the Talent Forum held in
Los Angelcs June 173, 1876 Among
the other institutions considered
were University oi California at
Berkeley and University of
Michigan. Clearly Grinnell College
has a gold mine tor a concert
program, Ms. Dentel is not only
responsible for the concert series,
but films and North Lounge dance
hands, all oi which require con-
stant, full time attention When
bands cancel suddenly, she knows
how lo replace them to make each
weekend’s activities worthwhile
While we see two movies, a concei'l
and a dance on the first weekend of
school, we should think aboul what
is behind the making of those
events,

AS concert chairmen, we oversee
the artist selection and coordinate
the production at each oi the
engagements, his. Dentel arranges
the use of college facilities, handles
‘calender' schedules for three
committees, and spends ten hours
a day on the phone making conr
lractual agreements with booking
agents. The Committee feels that
wnhoul a full time Staff person on
the job, the concert series, as well
as the films and dances. would
suffer irreparable harm. in
“trimming excess fat” we feel that
the administration is chopping at
the heart of Student aclivities. This
is no way to maintain a healthy
community atmosphere. Let’s not
let this issue die, We invite any
reaction to this article and any
suggestions tor the iuture. A
rational decision must be made,
