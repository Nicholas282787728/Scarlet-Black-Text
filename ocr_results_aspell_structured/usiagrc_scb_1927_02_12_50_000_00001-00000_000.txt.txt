The British economist expressed tlic

economically. He believes, however,
that as the political problems are
cleared away, the economic problcm
will be solved. Mr. Paish rcicrrcd w

action on me, by love, Was that the
only way that the United States could
continue her present policy was by
militaristic methods. In order to do

are against the Whole world. I do
not know whether or nut that was the
impression it was meant to convey."

“The United States is too big for
tlmt sort oi thing," Mr. Paish said
when asked if he believed ﬁle United
States administration to be swayed
by commercial interests in her policy
toward Mexico and Nicaragua. “Not
only that, but the commercial interests
in those countries are outbolancsd by
the ones outside," Mr. Paish added.
