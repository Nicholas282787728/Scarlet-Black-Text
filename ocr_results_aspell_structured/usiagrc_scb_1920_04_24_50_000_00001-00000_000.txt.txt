LASTING PEACE
IS NOTSEOUREI]
BY POLITICIANS

Allies ‘Should Present
United Front Still,
Says Dawson.

"The World is not yet sum that this
is the last War and it is the politicians.
who should have been statesmen, who
are at fault," declared Conningsby
Dawson, Who served With the Carr
adian artillery dad who is the author
of several successful war books. in a.
stirring address on “Remaking the
IVOl‘ld,” at Herrick chapel last night.

Mr. Dawson described vividly the
devastation of Europe and explained
how Germany is attempting to turn
defeat into victory by breaking up the
united front of the allies. He made a
strong plea for "the new sense of bro-
therhood that Won the War and would
have Won the peace.

"If you could see the price we paid
for peace, there would be a greater
tenacity in seeing that We get it," he
declared. "The world is not now safe
for peace and it is the youth who must
see that it is made so. The War was
fought by paciﬁsts whose only justiﬁ—
cation for ﬁghting it was that their
sons and their sons’ sons might not
go through the same hell. The poll-
t' iaris have made a treaty not for hu-
manity but for the safety of their gov—
ernments.

Individnhl Tommy Won Will‘.3

"The war was won by the spirit of
the individual Tommy up front. The
staff always did think all Was lost,
but Tommy fought on when he was too

‘wecry to walk, until he was knocked
out by death. It is among those who
gave most, thst the ideals for which
we fought the war‘ are most flamingly
alive today. They still have the same
high courage with which they fought.
They don’t want pity. for it breeds
self pily and that was their great
enemy in the trenches.

"The same spirit is reflected in
France. France insists that her
wounded are ﬁner for their sacriﬁce
'and they hold in their little villages 8.
position almost higher than that of
the priest. Most of the French sole
dlers were small farmers and through
scientiﬁc farming they are enabled to
go hook to their forms and make up
tor their handicaps."

Desc l es Devastliion in honor.

Mr. Dawson gave a detailed des—
cription of the devastation in north-
em France. saying that peasants
often are unable to locate within sev—
eral miles, the forms they tilled a few
years alga. The bombardments have
buried the shallow soil under chalk
which can not possibly be tilled, and
the ground is full of unexploded
lninés. Dear] bodies are still in the
trenches and tho countrykis full of
poison. When the Germans retreated
the inhabitants were driven off to Ger-
many as slaves.

coal mines can again he worked. It
is difficult tor these people to get back
to work and yet they are starting
again at the bottom.

In strange contrast to French.

tensively in central Europe since the

he ﬁnds there the same conﬁdent spirit
that existed before the war.

Germans Welcome Victorious Armies.

not dream of a new battleﬁeld. The
German has lost all trace of resent-

SHANTUNG OUESTION
MABY CLUB SUBJECT

Chung Tseng Gives Main Address
—Jolln Kingmall Present of
New Organization.

Chung l, Tseng, '20, spoke on "The
General Phases of The Shuntung
Question" at the ﬁrst meeting of the
newly reorganized Jcsse Macy Club
which was held in tho Auditorium oi
Alumllie Recitation Hall, Thursday
evening. '

Mr. Tscug is a native of Him Lci
Hsteri. Chihli, china.

"There is no question," he said, but
ﬁve Thai is, there are ﬁve parties
concerned each of which presents a
different side of tho pr.oblem

l. Thole is [he Shoniung question
of the students of Political Science,
International Law, and History.

2. There is the Shantung question
of Europe. in 1917, England, France,
Italy and Russia made a secret treaty
with Japan which provided that n
Japanese claim to German territory
would be supported oi the peace tnblo
in return for the destruction ol the
Gel-man power in that region,

3. There is the question of the Im—
perial Japanese government. Japan
has only been prevented from dealer'-
lng war on China by the fact that some
of the world powers yet have humane
tendcncies. Her object is to gain do—
minance of China by othcr means
since direct Warfare is denicd her.

i. The Sllcntung question of the U-
nited States is paramount in the press
and in public opinion. America was
the ﬁrst nation to defend Chinese
rights at the peace conference, and
has given a real demonstration of her
love of democracy for others as well
as for herself.

5. The last, phase of this-problem is
the Shantung question of China. The
world pities China, but she is not to
be pitied. The solution is easy. In 15-
98. the Germans landed in China and
demanded a. lease on Chinese land.
China was weak and disorganized and
Was lorced to accede to these demands,
with the outbreak of the war. China
pskcd permission of the allies to re»
gain the territory occupied by the Ger-
mans. This was refused and China
Japan then
declared war on Germany to gain the
territory. This was after China had
declared herself neutral, but' was yet
too weak to resist. Thcn Japan pre-
sented bcr series of twenty one de<
mands to China. who was again iorced
to agree. in 1918, Germany was beat-
en and China lost Shantung.
“"l‘hrouguut the entire course of the
disputc from 1393 until the present,
China has bcen defenseless. Without
iorce. the Chinese cannot hold then-
own property; they cannot exercise
their inherent lghts: they cannot look
into the future for help: they connot
look to any court lor settlement; they
must accept their fate. Howevcr, the
Chinese are not pnssive,‘ but prepar-
ing. It will be a difﬁcult tnsk, but the
Chinese have faith in their ability to
build up a nation and the timc must
come nbcu they willforco reparation."

Following bin Tscng’s speech, a
time was allowed for the discussion of
any phrases of this subject and a very
interesting period resultcd. Professor
J. w. Gannnway spoke lnicily on the
international aspectcf the situation.

work tllcre. Excerpts from their let-
ters follow:

“We had a good trip over the ocean
but were held up six days at Paris by
the French railroad strike and had
only the last day of the conference in
Geneva. We could not get across Ger-
many on account of the revolution and
had to go back from Geneva. to Paris
and make a f-csh start, ﬁnally going
down thru Sw zerland and across All-
stria, rcaching Czccho-Slovokia just a
month after sailing from New York.
This country looks pretty good. The
land is well cultivated. They had a
ﬁne crop last year and the prospects
are good for another. Coal is very
scarce because the coal territory is in
dispute with Poland and is not pro-
(luclng much. They have had no heat
in houses all winter. We find it pret-
ty cold in the hotel, even now. There
is little sunshluc lterc iu winter or
spring and the stone buildings are
very damp. There is much ull~emplul’-
ment in the cities and towns owing to
the scarcity of coal and cotton They
blame the Americans and English fol
not furnishing raw materials in some
way.

"The exchange situation is very
bad. Just before we come the krone
