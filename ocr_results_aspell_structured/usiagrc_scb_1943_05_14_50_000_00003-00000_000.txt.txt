The college will accept storage
from women students for the va—
cation period, Miss Evelyn Card-
ner, dean of Women, announced
today. The understanding is, that
in case of ﬂood, fire, r theft,
the college cannot be responsible
for property. However, it will
be placed in locked storage areas
and every precaution will be
taken, Miss Gardner said.

Each girl will be required to
have her property properly
packed in a box or trunk and
securely tied or nailed shut. Be-
cause of the manpower shortage
it will be necessary for each girl
to bring her own articles to the
designated storage room, she
stated.

A minimum charge of 25 cents
Will be made for any package or
furniture piece that a girl can
carry to storage. For any pieces
of furniture requiring extra la-
bor to handle, a charge of tifty
cents will be made. No storage
can be accepted without the pay-
ment being made, in cash, at
the time of storage,

Tabulafion Compuled On
Basis of 572 Service Merl

Over 45 per cent of the Grinneli
alumni now in the armed services
of the United states are serving
as commissioned officers, accord
ing to a survey released last night
by Dean Shelton L. Bcotty.

The tabulation, which is based
only on those records available
to the college as of May 13, is
concerned solely with alumni, and
was computed on the basis of
572 persons in service.

The ranlr of 109 men and women
reported to be in service is not
known, Beatty said. Also not iii-
cluded in the survey are 26 men
and women who have applied for
commissions, but are not as yet
in the armed sciwiecs. USO work-
ers, Red Cross workers, and alum»
iii in CPS camps were also not
included in this tabulation.

Men or women now in officer
candidate schools, however, were
considered as officers. Twelve are
now inidsl-iipmen, 26 arc officer
candidates. Aviation cadets were
considered to be without rating.

On this basis. 221 alumni are
commissioned officers, 45.28 per
