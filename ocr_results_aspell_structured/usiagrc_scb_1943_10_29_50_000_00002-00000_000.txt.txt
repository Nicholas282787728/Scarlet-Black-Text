GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

human and natural for some of you to
hope, that after your experience in zt to
tally disrupted life, you could return to
the same place where the happiest years
of your life were spent and see the “dear
old place again" just as it usetl to be. But
it is not so, and surely you must realize
that there is a need of change in a world
so vitally different. -

In the structure of our buildings, in
the beauty of the campus, and in the
reputation that Grinnell holds, we can find
strength and solidarity. This is the Grin-
uell Spirit. This will not, and need not
change. It is in the Grinnell

Welcome Home - -

Welcome home!

No two words could ever have been
written or spoken with more sincerity and
genuine feeling. A lot of trite things have
been said about Homecoming, and this
year, under such untrite circumstances,
they will be said again, But when ,said in
the spirit of friendship that only Gi'innell-
ions can show, they take on new meaning.
So it is with mingling emotions that we
extend to each returning alumnus a most
hearty Grinnell welcome. And to the thou-
sands of Glinnell's sons and daughters who
could not return for Homecoming, we e):-
tend a greeting that banishes the years,
and through the medium of the Grinnell
Spirit, makes you one of us again.

This week end’s gala celebration will
witness the return of many Grinnellians,
and there will be scarcely one among you
in all this sincere revelry who will not stop
for an instant to recall the days that used
to be, There will be bull sessions and hen
lieckels full of reminiscence and reverie.
This is as it should be for this is what
has made the Grinnell Spirit as strong as it
is today and what will enable it to con-
tinue with renewed strength,

To a great many of our graduates it
must' seem a bit disconcerting at first to
some from a world of change to an insti-
tution that is also changing. It is only

It sure sounds that way.

 

The Spearhead of Vic+ory - -

Although Navy Week itself is not such an

old tradition, the tradition of our naval,

spirit which it commemorates dates back
to the first days of our history,

This week is brought especially close
to us Grinnellians because of the return
of so many former Grinneilians who are
in that branch of the armed services at
Oberlin and Newberry colleges. Every re-
maining Grinnellian should make it his
duty to show his appreciation of what the

‘Navy stands for by making these men

welcome.

The United States Navy in this war has
done a magnificent job. Officers and men
have added glorious pages to the already
overﬂowing record of heroism at sea. The

men of this generation are living up to,

every tradition built in years past—add-
ing new stories of American courage.
When David Farragut, first admiral of
the United States Navy, bellowed the much
quoted words—”Damn the torpedos, full
speed ahead” he expressed a spirit that

has become traditional with our navy its
men—its ships—and more recently, its
planes. “Old Salamander” as Admiral Far-
ragut was fondly nicknamed, was from
stem to stern the fighting figure of a
man such as has made the American Navy
undaunted, unbeaten; one of the first
hopes of the world in the present war, to
wipe tyranny off the face of the earth!
This week is dedicated to our navy. All of
us, backing up our naval heroes, here at
home give a rousing cheer to encourage
them in the battle they are fighting so
well.
