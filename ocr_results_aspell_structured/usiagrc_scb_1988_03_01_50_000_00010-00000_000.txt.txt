If there was an issue
which was popular among
the students but was im-
practical or unrealistic,
what would you do?

Rob Killion
If after I investigated the par-
ticular issue and l was entirely
convinced that though the stun
dent body as a whole thought
that it was a good idea and that
it should be done, I was con.
vinced that it simply was not
feasible and it would be waste
of the vice-president’s time, 1
would try to convince the stue
dent body why 1 came to that
conclusion. l think that iii
investigated this issue enough
and I had genuine reason to
believe that it wasn’t feasible,
I think I’m articulate enough,
I think I could make a good
enough case through the s and
B, through an open forum that I
could convince the student body
that it wasn’t feasible and that
it wouldn’t be a good use of the
Vicespresidellt’s time. But what
I would not do is simply choose
to ignore the situation and not
let the students know why m
not doing anything about it.

Jeﬂ‘l‘ Fields

As part of my platform I’m
suggesting SGA open forums in
South Lounge. The idea behind
those is to get the truth out and
get student, faculty, and admin—
istration ideas. We‘d invite any
one who has anything to do with
the college to be there. whether
the issue was unrealistic or realc
istic, if it was a major issue on
campus, I would hold a forum.
And if it was an unrealistic is-
sue, I would be the ﬁrst to state
that I thought it was unrealis-
tic. Pushing it through would be
the decision of the students as 3

this. Basically, I looked through
old SGA records, and the rear
son it failed — it seems that the
reason it failed was that the ad—
ministration 7 the faculty, not
the administration, did not want
to take on the extra workload,
and they kind of said, “Well,
maybe some day when we have
a 3-2, we’ll accept it.” Now
we have a 3-2. And I think
it’s very possible. Some pea
ple are saying, “Well, we want a
women’s studies concentration."
That’s indicative of the problem
in general, but the concentra-
tions are too specialized. They
don’t appeal to very many stu-
dents. They‘re just not very
usable. But if they can de—
sign their own interdisciplinary
concentration, we can have the
women’s studies concentration
and any other students want.
And I think it can get through
now, now that the professors
have their 372 and have the time
to spend with students, which

they promised in return for a 3—
2. And 1 like this, because it
can turn something which was
viewed as bad for students to
our advantage. This next year
will be a tight year, but that’s
only temporary, and we can get
something permanent out of it.
And so, I think that’s an idea.
I’ll work all the way down to
some ideas that have very little
chance. Idon’t know ifyou want
me to go through all my ideas
now or if that will come up later.

Vice-Presidential Interviews

wllole. lf 500 out of 1250 stu-
dents Voted that they wanted to
push this through to the fullest
extent then 1 would have to sup
port that. If it was ﬁfty»ﬁl'ty,
then rd have to make a decision.
But if it’s unrealistic rm going
to say it’s unrealistic.

Cathy Baldwin

I would probably do my ut-
most to investigate the issue and
attempt to address what the
students found so popular about
it, what aspects were so terribly
impractical and unrealistic. A
good example is butter-days. Fi-
nals are not fun and we’d like to
do what we can to make them
as palatable as possible. Finals
should bed time when you know
you have to study and you know
you need to get your work done
and you’re trying to get a good
grade. You shouldn‘t have to
be overwhelmed by ﬁnals week.
So butler-days is a popular is-
sue. At the same time there
are a lot of other things to be
concerned with and I think that
a lot of people weren’t aware,
prior to the butler-days proposal
coming out, that there were so
many other things involved, So
if an issue came up which was
popular but impractical I would
approach it in a way which is
similar to buffer-days. That is,
get a committee together, or a
group of people which is really
interested in this. Deﬁne what
was so popular about it. Deﬁne
what was so impractical about
it. And see if there is come
promise we can come up with
that would satisfy the majority.
If there was no compromise i
would do my best to inform the
community as to why it was im—
practical.

Stephonie nedman

I’ve seen it happen on this
campus, and it’s important that
students realize that there are
only certain things that you can
do. ,Like I said, you have to
work within the structure, and
it‘s important to get that across
to the students. There are some
things on this campus that can’t
be achieved because tlle admin
istration opposes them or the

faculty opposes them or strongly
favors them and the student
views diﬁer with that. 1 think
it’s a matter of doing as much
as you can to get student views
across and respond to student
needs. I’d do as much as pos
sible. You’ve got to be able
to compromise. I’m not saying
that you have to back down to
the administration and faculty.
It’s not a matter oi being in-
timidated by the administration
and saying, “Okay, we’ll just go
along with this.” You’ve got to
be able to work with the admin—
istration and faculty, accurately
representing student views, try-
ing to work with them as much
as possible, trying to reach a
compromise that’s favorable to
everyone.

Chris Gunst

This is just the problem that
we faced in relays and peace
day. SGA is a representative
government. You’re elected be
cause they think you can imple
ment, most etrectively the polls
cies that they want. If students
are behind something that is to
tally impractical, ﬁrst you have
to just tell them it’s impractie
cal and ridiculous. They prob-

What would you do if you
were discussing an issue
which you felt was impor-
tant to the students and the
administration said “no”?
What do you do then?

Rob Killian

The ﬁrst thing that I would
do is try to genuinely listen to
the administration and see why
they had come to the decision
that that would not be possi-
ble. I would try to look at
the situation from their point of
view and try to decide if they
do have a valid case, or rather,
if it’s just foot-dragging. If i
feel that they do have a valid
case, that it’s something that’s
either not possible or not feasi-
ble at the present time, again I
would try to explain to the stu-
dent body why that’s the case.
if I felt it was footsdragging
or simply refusing to deal with
the subject, then I would at-
tempt to convince the adminis-
tration that they are wrong. I
would attempt to make a com-
promise, and I think l would
have the best chance of coming
to a compromise with the ad
ministration because one of my
strong points is, when I get into
a new job situation, my number
one priority is from the begin-
ning establishing a good work»
ing relationship with the peo
ple rm working with, And 1
would do that with the people
I’m working with in the admittise
tration, whether that be George
Drake or Wally Walker or Char-
lie Duke. And I think because
that good working relationship

would be there, I would have the
best chance of any student to get
them to change their mind.

Jeilr Fields

If the administration said no,
I would return to the students,
let them know what the admin-
istration said, and do one oi two
things. i would deﬁnitely ask
the students what they wanted
to do from there. If it was
something that I thought was
so important that a no answer
was not satisfactory, i would go
back and talk to different memr
bers of the administration, to
faculty members, talk to people
who have nothing to do with the
situation and see what kind of
different angles could be taken.
And if it comes down to it,

ably won’t understand because
they’re so set in their ways, but
then you have to vote your con—
science and that would be the
right vote. You are elected by
the people, but then you can‘t
just follow behind them, you
have to lead them.

Torn Worth '

I would investigate the issue
very carefully, and if it is im—
possible, as you say, 1 would in:
form the students on the rea-
sons why it is impossible llope
fully through the s and B ifit is
a very important issue and stue
dents are interested in it. Then,
offer to to interviewed with the
s and E, like here, to tell them
the rational why it’s impossible,
and why it can’t be done, cause
there are deﬁnitely things that
just can’t be done. I mean, stue
dents can only do so much. So
basically, I would just inform the
students why. I would give them
the rational {or why something
is the way it is, and why we’ll
have trouble changing it.

I would motivate such things
as student boycotts. Boycotts
oi the library; boycotts oi the
bookstore; boycotts of the fo—
rum This is a last resort, but if
we can’t take no for an answer
on something, and I think it’s
very important for the students
to receive certain things, then l
would go to all extents to get
this {or the students. I prefer to
negotiate. lprefer to talk. But
when talk doesn’t workl think
action works a lot better.

Cathy Baldwin

In the ﬁrst place it is difli.
cult for me to envisio a situa-
tion in which the admi istration
would say flat out no. You do
not include in that scenario an
explanation which would proba-
bly be provided or which could
at least be coerced out at some.
one somewhere. if i was dis.
cussing something with students
which was of concern to them, I
would continue that with discus.
sion. it it was of concern to me
and I thought it was important
to the students then I probably
would continue with the discus
sioll even if the administration
said no. That’s not to say that
1 am going to buck the adminis-
tratioll at any time out of sheer
belligerence or simply because I
think rm right all the time and I
think they’re wrong all the time.
It’s imperative that you work
cooperatively with the adminis-
tration. I think there would be
considerable outcry and dismay
if such an occurrence took place.
The procedure for that kind of
situation would be to determine
where the ’no‘ came from, why
it occurred, and then try to ex
plain to the administration our
ideas and what the purpose was
for discussing the issue in the
ﬁrst place, and why we feel it’s
important, and why we will cone
tinue the discussions unless they
can provide us with a satisiace
tory answer as to why we should
not continue.

Stephanie Redman

It depends how important the
issue is on campus. If the ad-
ministration absolutely said no,
I’d try to come up with some ale
ternative. I’d try to suggest that
students do as much as possible
on their own to put pressure on
the administration. If it’s that
important an issue, students will
be willing to do that.

Chris Gunst

I write an article in the S
and B, because I think right
now that’s probably the best
way to get to most students.
I go back and back and fill
up George Drake’s appointment
book. Maybe after eight times
he gets the idea. 1 go see the
faculty, Don Smith, heads of de-
partments. It depends on what
issue it is but, where it’s ap—
plicable like if it’s about the
new AIDS group that’s form-
ing in GCGC then you go to
that group and try to get them
out too. If it‘s an academic
concern then you get all the
EPC’s, all the people on Aca-
demic Advising Committee and
you get them out and helping
you, Eight people do more work
and a better job than one per-
son does. All you can do is get
as many people as you can into
it, get it as publ' ’zed as you can
and force the administration to
listen.

Tom Worth
Once again, it’s the situation.
lt depends on the reason they’re
saying no. if there was'a very,
very good reason,,kind of al-
most related to the,la.st,.ques-
tion, if there was's,very good
reason, it’s simply impossible
— I mean, nothing we can do
to change it 7 I mean, truly
impossible, then, once again, 1
would try to explain the ratio-
nal to the students, and what
can be done. it they’re just sim-
ply saying no, but it could be
done, that’s a whole other situ—
ation. It’s time to be a diplo~
mat. It’s time for student refers
endums, and it’s time for 7 it
makes give—andtake, and work-
ing with them a little more dif-
ﬁcult. I would push it, as far as
I could. But also, at the same
tilne, I wouldn’t want to wreck
my relationship with them. It’s
not worth ruining the relation-
ship with the faculty or admin
istration over one issue. I think
to be effective, you have to keep
a good relationship, so I would
pusll it as hard as I could with
out destroying that relationship,
and thereby making mysell‘inefn
{active for any other issue that
comes up. But I would step up
the pressure. so to say, diplo
matically.

By your estimation, how
much time do you expect to
spend as vice-president

next year 7

Rob Killion -~

As a cabinet member right
now I probably spend an ave
erage of ten hours a week on
son related work. As the vice-
president, 1 would spend more
time than that, simply because
it’s a much larger job than I do
now, And to do any kind of
justice to the job l would have
to give it more time. I cer-
tainly can’t give an exact ﬁgure,
but I can say that because I do
love the work I do in SGA and
because 1 know what the vic
president does, 1 would be wi
ing to spend a. lot or time on
Like most other people I’m wi -
ing to give a lot of my time and
a lot of my energy to things I
enjoy doing.

Jeff!‘ Fields

It’s a tough question to an-
swer, I can’t really guess how
much time I‘m going to put in.
I would say putting in 20 hours
a week would not be out of
the question. Right now I’m

working 10.12 hours in other
jobs. That would deﬁnitely be
cut down to 3-5 hours a week.
Twenty to twentyeﬁve hours a
week for sea work does not
sound out of the question to me.

Cathy Baldwin

Twenty—four hours out of a
twentyreight hour day, maybe?
That‘s very diaicult to tell.
Aside from what is dictated to
me in the by-laws (it says 1 have
to have at least two hours of of—
fice time) I don’t anticipate that
1 will spend that minimum. 1
t ' k most oi my day-to—day ace
ti ities will be son related and
if rm lucky I might get a day
off out of a week. Right now
in my duties M senator, and
committee chair, and commits
tee this and committee that l
