FOR BETTER PUBLICATIONS

The proposed publications plan, upon which
you will be asked to vote in ten days, is one
that has long been a need on this campus.

As a student, this plan should receive
your support for two primary reasons:
First, it will make possible a better Scarlet
mwl Black. Second, it will assure the publi—
cation of an annual evely year.

' At the present time, the Scarlet and Black
receives an annual subscription fee of 75
cents per student, the money being taken
from the general funds of the college, and
it has long been felt that the Scarlet and
Black should be suppmted in some other
way inasmuch as the general fund was
never intended for that purpose.

Bcsides the dubious permanency of the
Scarlet and Black’s subscription income, ris-
ing publication costs have necessitated a
continued policy of retrenchment with the
result that the students have been receiving
a smaller newspaper each year. This plan
would make more money available to this
publication and permit the issuing of more
six-page issues and the use of more photo—
graphs.

The present plan of financing the Cyclone
is of an extremely temporary nature, and
there is no assurance that it would be ape
proved as a permanent measure. The idea
of collecting the $4 subscription fee from
the student’s room deposits and from volun—
tary subscriptions is not entirely satisfac~
tory and is unfair. And, in this case also,
the money is being obtained from a source
that was never intended for that purpose
ethe room deposit.

The objection that this means a $5 in-
crease in fees is not correct. At the present
time an overwhelming majority of the stu-
dent body has subscribed $4 for an annual,
which means a net increase of only 50 cents
per student per semester, But this also
means that the 75 cents the student now
spends on his Scarlet and Black will be able
to be used for some other purpose—to be
put to the use for which it was really in-
tended as a part of the regular college bud-
get. In other words, you as a student will

be paying an extra 25c a year, and this
quarter will mean assurance of an annual,
and a bigger and better Scarlet and Block.

The tentative proposal has been approved
ill substance by every committee to which
it has been presented. L. V. Phelps, college
treasurer, has also stated that the plan
would serve to correct the problems now
facing Grinnell college in regard to pub-
lications.

—G—
PAN-AMERICANISM

Within a few days at Lima, Peru, there
will commence another Pan-American con-
ference at which the nations of this hemi—
sphere will endeavor to find some common
ground on which to build a mutually desir-
able program. What is the common ground,
and what is the mutually desirable pro-
gram?

When an analysis is made, it is difficult to
find the common ground. Other than the
fact that all of the nations concerned are
in the Western hemisphere, what is there?
The languages and customs differ markedly,
the traditions and attitudes of government
are no where the same. The various nations
are none too congenial toward one another.
The races involved are heterogenious, and
some are only nleagerly advanced. Most of
the Latin-American countries are under
quasi-militaiy despotisms, and in the others,
where aristocratic plutocracies hold sway,
there are only a few marks of truly demo-
cratic government. Even the fear of Euro—
pean agression is not str lg enough to
corral the Latin nations behind a common
prograln

The United States is anxious to set up a
continental or hemispherical program. It
wants the LatineAmerican countries as
agreeable partners in the general scheme,
and as nouless than silent partners in the
details. But because there is so slight a
common ground on which to build, no elab-
orate details can be advanced. In the offer»
ing are: (1) verbal adherence to democratic
ideals of government; (2) a Pan-American
Court of Justice; (3) a Palermel'lcal]
League of Nations; (4) ‘a joint naval policy.

All in all, Pall-Americanisln is still only
a little more than a dr am.

REMEMBER THEWGIE

It’s fun to boast about “the time we went
for 96 hours without sleep last yeargexcept
for the sleep we got in classes, of course.”
But the memories of those days have grown
vague. Now those exhausting nights of study
seem “collegiate," _

Then we knew that they were just silly
freshman tricks caused by our lack of force
sight and planning. We forget how hard it
was, trying to hold our drooping eyes open
and type at the same time. We forget the
tedium of counting words over and over,
trying to coax another five hundred out of
inadequate notes, already drained of every
conceivable fact. We forget the erratic habits
of the lighting system on those nights, and
the cold indifference of the radiators. We
forget how we said then: “Never again.”

After Christmas vacation, we will once
more be faced with the problem of complet
ing the assigned work, of writing term pa~
pers, and then of taking—and passing—
exominations. Now that we are adjusted to
our schedules and know the plans for our
courses, there is an excellent opportunity to
organize our work

Why not do a little concentrated studying
du 'ng these next two weeks, and enjoy
Christmas vacation with a clear conscience?
Even Grinnell beds can be very welcome on
cold January nights. And the final examin-
ations shouldn’t be too final,
