Qlﬁiicriizl

HERE is cvmy reason to
- believe that the I. S. C.
tenth which is to make us a visit
on Saturday is fully the equal of
the iowaaggreg. n whose game
here called out such a large at
tendancc a couple or weeks ago.
This does not imply however
that the Scarlet and Black must
be deieated in the coming game.
It should that as many
rooters must be present. spirit
should run as high and Support
should be given to the team just
as loyally as when we all sailed
torth in the hope or' winning a
game from the State University.
It should mean that a game will
be played here on November7
the equal in all respects of the
last one on “land Field and that
Grinnell must needs play splendid
football in order to avoid being
badly beaten. It means that Iowa
College needs more than ever
substantial encouragement it the
victory we hope for shall come,
Amcsls still in the race [or the
championship. as tar as it can be
decided thls year and, her players
will surely bearthat fact in mind.

HIGH SCHOOL v3. WEST DES

The annual scrimmage bctween
the high school and West Des
Memes occurred siturday after
noon at Ward Field the
latter nut defeat by a score of
2240.

131th tetm: played last snappy
ball but Grinnell showed her
superiority in team work on] good
judgement in directing plays, se-
curing two touchdowns in the ﬁrst
half and keeping th: ball almost
eonsttzttly in De: Maines' terri-
tory.

In Ill“ Ss'jdntl hilf the Visitors
took a decided brace and securing
the ball marched down the ﬁeld
by sloy but consistent gains for a
touchdnvn. A pretty drop lcick
by ﬁllings-worth completed Des
Morncs’ scoring while Grinnell sec
cured twotouchdowns in this hall

by wide Circling end runs and
steady, hard line buclts. The
ﬁnal score shows the relative
strength of the two teams and the
victory puts Grinnell in the run-
ning for the state championship.

There is true poetry in Nil-Smith's
playing, brilliant
enables him to express wonder-

his technique

fully to his audience something
of the depth of his musical soul.
In the selections which he gave
on the piano, he revealed his un
derstandingof MncDowell's na
ture. “At an Old Trysting Place,"
“To a Water Lily." Tea Wild
Rose.” “In Mid-Ocean,” and [he
“Nautilus" were as beautliul. It
was Mr. Smith's playing which
mosttruly gave to the audience
the conception of MacDowell as
a lyrist.

Mr. Olds sang with freshness
and buoyancytwo exquisite bits
of song. “My Jean.” and “Thy
Beaming Eyes.” Mr. Condit's
singing of "Deserted” and "Slum-
ber Song” was very good. His
ﬁne tenor voice always ﬁnds a
welcome.

The work of the Grinnell Quar-
tettc has been in demand througlr
out the state. Accuracy, rich
blending of voices, and true inters
pl'etation characterized their work
last night, and assured the atldi
cncc that the reason for the
Quartette's popularity and success
is merit.
