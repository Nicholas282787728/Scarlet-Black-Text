I submit that that statement is
the most damning of all because it
is an outright admission that
teaching periormance is not
considered to he the primary
reason for the retention oi a iaculty
member. If teaching is considered
so unimportantas to not be the sole
basis ior retaining a faculty
member, then Grinnell College
must redetine its purposes

T0 [)0 OTHERWISE is
hypocritical and fraudulent. To say
that an evaluation may be made on
other criteria lwlth the direct
observation of a teacher not
necessary to the evaluative
process) is clearly a violation of
the rights of academic ireedom. I
am “punished" ior unr
substantiated actions, yet those
who made statements about me
\Vithout ever having seen me teach
have the support oi the ad
ministration, the Executive
Council and the Appeal Board.

One need only examine the
contents of my file to know that the
statements made above are ac-
curate and correct in their proper
context, I invite any and all in
terested parties to examine that
file, which I will make public if so
requested. Let my former

 

colleagues then dispute, in public,
the morality of their actions.

I CHALLENGE Goldsmith,
Jensen, King, Fudge and Solis to a
public discussion of this issue.
Included in the invitation are the
members of the Executive Council
and the Appeal Board, the dean
and president of the college,

Once and for all. let the Grinnell
community know how personnel
decisions are madeLand let us
clear up all the questions con
cerning the validity of evaluations
made without the benefit of actual
tirst hand observation. Let the
discussion be broadcast live over
KDICmso that all might know the
truth,

THE ISSUE of faculty retention
cannot beswcpt under the rug It is
an issue which affects every
student and every non-tenured
member of the faculty. Those
protected by tenure do not have to
worry about positions as do the
others. Isn’t it the same old story of
tenured people, with no tear oi loss
oi Job, making crucial career
decisions [or others who must
constantly demonstrate (above
and beyond the call of dutyl the
ability to be all things to all people
at all times?

Poitier and Cosby team up again

by Larry Pinrler

No films are offered to com-
plement Black Cultural Weekend,
and a classic Western which is
practically responsible tor the
recent revival of the genre turns up
on campus.

Let's Do It Again, the i975 sequel
to Uptown Saturday Night, is an
entertaining if simple comedy by
Sidney Poitier, who directed and
starred with Bill Cosby The film
portrays the pair of chums we met
in the earlier film and follows their
further dealings with black
mobsters.

This time around, the two travel
to New Orleans to gyp the mob out
oi enough money to build a new
meeting hall for their lodge. the
Sons and Daughters of Shaka.
Their scam has to do with hyp-
notizing a nytveight prizeiighter
played by Jimmy Walker.

Since he started directing,
Poitier has produced three other
comedies much like this one. It's as
ii he’s trying to create iilms ior
blacks that are not “black
sploitation" films His intention is
certainly an honorable one, and
though none of the iilms has
shaken the toundations of the

 

exploitation industry,
undeniably iun.

Cosby translates ivell onto
screen. and, though slapstick is not
precisely his iorte, Poitier
manages to play a passable
straight man.

Brothers was directed last year
by Arthur Barron and ieatures
Bernie Casey as a Soledad Brother
George Jacksonrlike character and
Vonetta McGee as an Angela Davis
Iigure,

When Jackson died in 1971, he
was awaiting trial. he and two
other black prisoners were
charged with killing a guard at
Soledad Prison in California.
Jackson wrote letters from San
Quentin that succeeded in making
his case a rallying point iorthe leit.
His closest tie with the outSIde was
Davis, whom he loved.

Jackson’s brother had died in a
shootout at the Marin County
courthouse aiter trying to take
hostages, some say to use in
bargaining for Jackson’s ireedom
Davis was circumstantially tied to
the episode. Jackson was gunned
down in the yard of San Quentin
Prison in 1971.

The film wraps this story in

they are

 

iiction, then examines the
possibility that Jackson was
harassed. and that none oi the
charges against the Soledad
Brothers could have been made to
stick in the iirst place.

John Ford's Stagecoach (1939)
breathed new life into the Western.
l-lad Ford not come along, we
might never have had to deal with
such recent efforts as The Shootist
and True Grit. But Ford‘s film is
well Worth the lame iilms to which
it gave vent.

Dudley Nichols s script is overly
ambiguous and allegorical, but
nonetheless Fold and his cast give
to the hint and the genre a
dramatic flexibility and a sense oi
tradition.

it you want to look at the movie
symbolically it will not challenge
you much: however, if you watch it
as simple entertainment, it will
surely rouse you. John Wayne is,
the Ringo Kid (“I guess you can’t
break out oi jail and into society in
the same week”), and others
traveling crossAcountry in the
coach Include Claire Trevor and
Thomas Mitchell. who won an
Oscar for his performance as a
drunken doctor
