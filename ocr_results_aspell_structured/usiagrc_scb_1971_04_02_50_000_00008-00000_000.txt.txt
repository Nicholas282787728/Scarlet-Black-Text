Runners Close Season With 4th

The Grinnell track team en-
ded its 1971 campaign witha
fourth place tie at the Mid-
west Relays at Naperville,
Illinois, fighting with 17 other
teams for their berth.

The meet came on the first
day of spring break and the
desire to flee the rigors of
the midwest environment ovr
ermme most of the team.
Only seven men from Grinnell
competed in the meet.

Top perfomer was Chuckie
McGrabber, who copped first
in the two-mile and fifth in
the mile. Paul Lewis, who
has given up the radio station
in exchange for track spikes,
boosted a mile relay team
including Mark Siegfried, Bill
swan, and Philos Morales to
a third place.

McGrath took Siegfried's
spot as that relay unit ran the
two-mile relay for a fifth
place, but Siegfried came back
for the sprint medley and the
Grinnell buffers puffed their
way to fourth place.

Jon Gray plowed through the
hurdles and Tim Power vault‘
ed over the bar. Coach Mac-
Dowell provided entertainc
ment and a 15 pound standing
rib of beef after the meet.

The outdoor season begins
today as a 37 man team meets

Dr. Emanuel Margoliash, a

biochemist from Abbott Lab-
oratories in Chicago, will sp~
eak on "Cytochrome C Struce
ture and Evolution” at 8 p.m.
tonight in Science 171.

Margoliash has done work on
protein structure which has
important implimtions for
evolutionary theory.

Margoliash will also be at a
coffee hour at 4 in Science
216, a Forum PDR dinner at
6, and a reception at the Grin-
nell House at 9:30.

Committee Rejects Preposal
For An All-Black Floor

The Housing Committee has
asked the Concerned Black
Students (CBS) to submit an
alternative to their proposal
for an all-black floor. The
committee was concerned with
the possible unconstitutional~
ity of the ell-blgc‘; floor pro-
posal (on the basis of the 1964
Civil Rights Act). Noresponse
has yet been received from
CBS.

The groups who will occupy
the four off— campus coopera-
tives have been chosen by the
Housing Committee. Ann Ad-
ams is the representative of
a group who will live in Cone
oco House and study film.
Janet Chandler and Clayton
Lee represent the group in
Conference House. Groups re-
presented by Steve Polkow
and Mike Breed will live in
1127 Park Street and Pine

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

April 2, 1971

Atropine Causes High Heart Beat, Body Temp

(continued from page 6)

commonly referred to as
"atropine fever." In a few
reported cases of atropine
poisoning in infants, body temr
perature has been noted to rise
to as high as 109 degrees F.
Fatalities from overdoses of
belladonna alkaloids are so
mewhat rare and death will
not likely result from the con-
sumption ofatropine-conmm-
inated "psychedelic" drugs.
in high enough doses, though,
atropine can produce delir-
ium, palpitation of the heart,
ﬂushed skin (which feels hot,
dry, and looks scarlet), and
blurring of vision, often fol-
lowed by hallucinations. The
behavior of individuals in a
state of atropine poisoning
resembles somewhat that of
individuals afﬂicted by orgne
ic psychoses or toxic disord-
ers. Memory is grossly disc
mrbed, the individual has tr-
ouble orienting himself to his
surroundings, and the emer
gence ofa type of ”madness"
not easily differentiated from
the delirium tremens ofchrcr
nic alcoholism is not uncom-
mon. This syndrome can last
for as long as 48 hours, and
symptoms may persist for
days or even weeks.
Individuals in states of atroa
pine poisoning should be brr
ought to medical facilitieswh»
ere a confirming diagnosis
can be made and where the
proper antidotes can be ad-
ministered (if necessary). In
rare cases, emergency arti-
ficial respiration with oxygen
is indicated. If. the symptoms
are relatively minor and only
a small dose has been mken,
it is wise to have the person

lie down in a darnened, quiet
room - ice packs may provide
symptomatic relief.

Investigators in the field of
biopsychiatry believe that at-
ropine (and some of the more
powerful anticholinergic halt
lucinogens) can more effect
ively model the psychOtic state
than can the LSD-type drugs.
Consequently, individuals sh-
ould be aware that belladonna
type drugs may bemore likely
to precipitateapsychoticstate
in normal and pro-schizoV
phrenic subjects. The use of
atropine and similar drugs in
high doses is of questionable
psychological and physiolo-
gical value, for there seem to
be far more safer and effec-
tive pharmacological (and
non-pharmacological) tech'
niques for achieving states of
altered consciousness.

It seems a sad commentary
on the state of the present
"psychedelic subculture" that
the very practices of the es-
tablishment which are critir
cized as hypocritical (a lack
of “truth in packaging" and
me slick merchandizing tech—
niques of Madison Avenue)are
the same practices employed
by the purveyors of our chef
mical sacraments. When tele-
vision sells Middle America
an electric toothbrush, it does
not sell the toothbrush, but an
entire way of living (of which
the toothbrush is but one small
component). In much the same
manner the dealer who offers
his clientele a plethora of
"mind-altering goodies”
(from 4-way “sunshines” to
speckled psilocybin ”pumpkin
seeds") performs as much as
disservice to the "contrar
culture.” Unwary and ins

experienced buyers are being
led to believe that if they
haven’t been “stoned" with
Dealer X‘s acid, then they’ve
never been "stoned.” i mind
washed in one dealer’s mesca-
line is purported to be “whi-
ter than white" while the head
of the unfortunate user of
brand X seems to display the
same old discouraging collar
stains. "New" and ”impro-
ved" preparations are being
hawked with all the fervor of
the quack who sells us
Anacin R on the tube.

Scores of underground che-
mists who have discovered
that the Life magazine claim
that anyone who receiveda E
in high school chemistry can
make good, pure LSD is a
myth, have compensated by
spiking their concoctions with
everything from ampheta~
mines to belladonnaalkaloids.
The powerful financial incente
ives associatedwith the manur
facture and sale of illicitpsy-
chedelics have, unfortunately,
attracted the same types of
unscrupulous merchandizers
who have grown rich convince
ing us to buy cars that are
unsafe, diet drinks that cause
cancer and a frightening var-
iety of status symbols that
are of no human use. A3 are
sult, many of the "freaks”
who have gotten involved with
the psychedelic scene in the
past few years may have never
had a real LSD experience. It
is not difficult to comprehend
the increasing cynicism ofthe
"flower children" as theyarc
manipulated and possibly even
poisoned by people taking ad*
vantage of their implicit trust
in others.
