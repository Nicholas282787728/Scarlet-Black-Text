Jackson VOWS to be at
the ‘point of Challenge’

by Dave Jones

"We have a strong military and
weak leadership; guided missiles
and misguided leadership: it's
time ior a basic change," beckon-
ed the Reverend Jesse Jackson as
he addressed the college Commullir
ty Wednesday.

Using iorceiul condemnations oi

scolding his iellow candidates ior
not making bold stands. and spic~
ing it all with poignant one-liners.
Jackson captured the attention oi
the campus as no other candidate
has

As Democrats have tried to do
throughout Ronald Reagan‘s
tenure. Jackson drew a diiiercnt
picture oi American society. He
talked oi our generation in its unr
iavorable light. Teenage pregnan-
cies Drug abuse. Suicide Pro
blems oia generatio “beneath the
veneer oi yuppism."

His comments about his iellow
candidates revolved around one
central theme: "Jesse Jackson has
iaced challenges. his opponents
have turned their backs." From
the Civil Rights movement to the
gay rights movement to the ‘abor
movement, he stressed that he has
been at the “point oi challenge,"
while his opponents have backed
down.

Somewhere between the conclw
sion oi his speech and his hurried
exit, Jackson spoke with the
Scarlet and Black about his cam»
paign and about his views on
several issues oi concern to Grin-
neli students.

Scarlet and Black:

Your campaign has not raised as
much money as the other can
didates’. now has this caused dil-
ierences in the structure bi your
campaign compared with the
others”?

Grinnell

by Susan Roth

The issue oi inadequate iaculty
salaries is not a new problem in
higher education. nor is it unique to
Grinnell. Unlike many institutions,
though, especially small colleges,
Grinnell has a {a war of com-
petitiveness to considi r beyond the
usual comparison oi tiiching ver
sus the more “proﬁtable" proiesr
sinns.

According to a rec‘ent study cane
ducted by Al Jones, acting director
of the Roseniield Public Affairs
Program, Grinnell faculty have
higher salaries than most ACM
tassociaied colleges oi the
Midwest) and other small colleges.
However. the college ranks near
the bottom of the Us. News and
World Report top ten (1985 rank-
ings}. especially ior the ranks oi
assistant and associate professor.

Since 1981. the administration
and the budget committee have
made efforts to improve the situa
tion, These eiiprts have

tally, our campaign is receiving a
great reception because oi the
message, because oi the direction.
The word goes iorth and our
volunteers continue to mount up.
Our campaign is the most diverse
it has the broadest base, its the
most multinational, it's the most
multicultural. it has the most na
tional support. because we have
done the most national service

Scarlet and Black:

Recent Studies have shown that
lewer and iewer blacks are going
into higher education and graduate
school Why is this the case"

Jackson:
It is true that fewer and Iewer

'In the final analysis,

blacks are going into higher educa-
tion. in part because ol lack oi
money and because oi a lack oi
commitment to afﬁrmative action,
But tower and lower youth who
come from the homes at the poor

iewer are going into education

that trend and see the advantage of

disincentives.

culminated in a three-year plan,
agreed upon by the trustees oi the
college. The plan is designed to in-
crease salaries across the board
and is currently in operation.
However. as Jones pointed out.
”Since we were 50 low coma
petitively, that three-year plan
may not bring us up to a desired
competitive level.”

The problem oi keeping up with
costoi-living increases, while obr
viously not uncommon, also has a
special dimension at Grinnell Col-
lege. because oi its semirurai loca-
tion. Oil the one hand, the issue oi
cost oi living is slightly less of an
immediate problem due to the {act
that living expenses in Grinnell.
Iowa are somewhat lower than in a
more urban area. On the other
hand, however, the more rural
location oi the college makes it
necessary to increase salaries in
order to be competitive in attraCr
ting iaculty. especially younger

Jackson:

other words, when scholarships
were available and aiiirmative ac~
tion was operative. the numbers
went up When scholarships went
down and aiiirmative action went
down. the numbers went down.
There's nothing mysterious about
it. we simply need to have a com-
mitment. And we need to see the
advantage oi it. it is to the distinct
advantage oi youth at Grinnell Col-
lege to have a multicultural staii oi
