UNIQUE REGITALGIVEN
BY BAHRERE ENSEMBLE

Nine Artists Present New Form
Of Music With Wind In-
struments.

The Barr-ere Ensemble, the “ix ud
Instrument Choir," led by Mr,» George
Barr -c, gave a most delighttul recital
in Herrick Chapel Monday evening to
one of the largest audiences ever as»

. sembled in die building. Unique in
every respect, this new iorm oi music
was appreciated by all who heard it

Especially impressive was the unity
of the Ensemble, which sounded like a
large organ or a huge accordion, altho
it had much sweeter tones than any
single instrument, and a greater range
of ilexib ity than a trio or a quartet.
The playing of each man was as per-
teet in itself as it each part had been
a solo. This work is a tribute tc Mr.
Barrel'e’s evident leadership in r -
hear-sals. In this assemblage of in-
struments one seemed to be able to
see the theme or the number even bet-
ter than In some of the other recitals
that have been in Grinnell this year.
EspEcially was this true in their inter~
pretatiun of the Chadwick numbers
The Perilllou numbers were also
charming, especially the spritely
“Come."

Mr. Barrel‘e’s solo numbers awdk»
cued the audience to the beauty of the
ﬂute as a solo instrument.

RYAN WRITES FOR
ENGLISH JOURNAL

Article 011 Public Speaking In
Chicago Publication.

An article by professor J. P. Ryan
appeared in the last issue of The Eng—
lish Journal, a magazine published by

'the University or Chicago. The paper
was read at a meeting of The lowa
State Teachers Association on Novem-
li'en 2, and was named by the writer.

"Recent Tendencies in the Teachingl

of Public Speaking in College."

Many of the ideas expressed in the ‘

. article are characteristic of Mr. Ryan’s
courses here. He puts stress on the
fact that the teaching of speech should
be in a separate department, but that
ILis department should be in correla-
tion with all other departments or col~
leget The improvement in the meth-

ods of teaching speech, and the new,
recognition of the importance of eur- 1

root speech in all phas s of society
are particularly mentioned. The ear»

“HEARTS OF THE WORLD."

“It we can’t have what we want,
let‘s want what we can have," was the
philosophy practiced by the little
French grisette character, portrayed
in D. W. Griliith‘s "Hearts of the
World" by Dorothy Gish and called the
greatest niece of character acting ever
witnessed on the screen.

This "Little Disturber" as she is
known in the play. loved the hero, but
the latter had another sweetheart. By
all the arts and wiles known to her
profession she tried to make him love
her, and once, just as the other sweet—
heart, the real one, came into view the
little girl threw her arms around him
and—well the betrothed one was a
heartbroken girl until sincere apolo-
gloss and real penance were offered by
the hero.
