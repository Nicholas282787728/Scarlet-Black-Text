Students start lecture series Wednesday

by Richard Letchlnger

Beginning wednesday at 4:30 pm. in
Steiner 27 and continuing every
Wednesday throughout the semester,
the newlyiormed Student Lecture
Series will sponsor presentations by
Grinnell College students on a wide
variety of subjects.

kim Chandler and Yafa Napadensky
developed the lecture series because of
frustrations they experienced over the
lack or communication between
students on campus.

“There‘s a lack of respect among
students for what each of us has to
say," Chandler said. "1 realized that in
classes students never write down what
other students have to say, only what
the prots say. i thought sharing our
ideas on a wider basis might be a good
idea.”

The idea lor the series evolved last
year after Napadensky had returned

from Japan. "Ilse L ' 'nger was
teaching a cities class," Napadensky

explained. "And she asked me to come
in and talk to her class about my ex-
periences. I realized that people have
lots oi questions about what other peer
ple did on programs abroad but don't
have a way oi learning what those peo-
ple know."

Chandler and Napadensky noted that
the students on this campus have a
tremendous amount of resource
knowledge that they have gained from
a wide range oi , experiences. "We
thought this (the seriesl would be a
good way for the ﬁlings people knew to
get shared as well as give some
students a chance to work on the oral
skills," Chandler said. She went on to
say that when the college “imports”
speakers they don't stay on campus
long enough for the students to fully

digest what the speaker has to say. "By
haying students give some lectures, it
someone had 3 though or idea on the
topic at a later date, the lecturer would
always be easily accessible," Chandler
said,

Wednesday's lecture will be given by
Dave Hudson and the topic will be
“Liberal Arts and the Meaning of a
Grinnell Education." Other topics to be
discussed include: Community
Organizing, Economic Problems in a
Capitalist Society, Vegetarian Nutrir
tion, Corporate investment in South
Airica, Aging in America, U.S. Energy
Policy and LiVing History Museums.

Chandler and Napadensky expressed
hope that both students and professors
would attend the series. They also
pointed out that the series would be
very "participatory" tor the audience.
"We expect lots of discussion to follow
the lecture." Chandler said.

Duties redistributed in Carl’s absence

by Mike Alexander

With Janet Carl gone as associate
dean of Student Affairs, the college's
Office of Student Affairs has had to
reorganize some responsibilities to
make up for her loss.

Resident Adviser Barb Gaddis has
taken on the temporary responsibility
of selecting and training the new Stu-
dent Advisers as well as supervising
over present S,A.s and other R.A.s. She
is also continuing her involvement with
individual counseling for students with
personal problems.

Other duties previously controlled by
Carl have been delegated to Jim Tederr
man. Barry Hull and Susan Wittpenn.
According to Wittpenn, there are no
reorganizationai problems within the
Student Affairs office.

Astor Carl's replacement, the college
is presently advertising for a suitable
successor and will be hiring sometime
this spring, The replacement will begin
work on July 1.

Meanwhile. Car] is becoming
oriented with her new role as state
representative from Iowa‘s District 71.
She will be serving on the Education,
Energy and Human Resources Come
mittees and the Social Services Sub-
committee of the Appropriations Com-
mittee which convened Jan. 12,

After her resignation irorn Grinneii
last December, Carl attended an orien
tation session for new legislators. There
she realized the importance of her
assignments. since most oi the work on
new legislation occurs in committee
belore being taken up by the iull House
for debate.

"Each of these committees will have
January 30, Will

difficult challenges belore it during the
next legislative session," Carl noted.
"In Education we will be faced with the

problem of school budgets which have -

been severely harmed by the
governor‘s budget cuts. in Social Ser-
vices we will need to be highly selective
in our funding by carefully determining
which programs can be cut back and
which must be maintained at current
levels."

Carl also noted that incentive plans

for the use of solar energy and a more
comprehensive Weatherization pro-
gram will probably be on the docket for
the Energy Committee. She thinks that‘
legislation to reorganize the mental
health delivery system in the state,
which was introduced last year, may
surface again in the Human Resources
Committee. She expected. though, that
most of the time in the next session-
would be devoted to the budget, reap~‘
portionment and utility rate reform. '

Minor ﬁre citations found

by Jim Coodtellow

Representatives of the Fire Prevenr
tion SuperVisor bi iowa inspected all
college-owned buildings last week and
left the administration with numerous
citations and considerable flexibility to
meet fire safety regulations.

According to Provost Waldo Walker.
none of the citations are serious or imps
ly such costly repairs to warrant or
even suggest condemning any building,
The inspectors left the administration
with generally minor citations for each
building. The administration will pro
pose plans to meet state standards
where violated.

The process or dealing with the cita~
tions affords the college options to meet
the standards set forth in the state fire
codes..Walker described the process as
cooperative, "Each citation they make
will require a response from us which
they can accept or reject. We had a long
talk with them alter they made their
citations and have a good idea of what
will be acceptable, ' he said.

Walker demonstrated the flexibility
any college administration maintains
with an example involving the Univer-
Sity oi Northern Iowa. The lire inspec~
tors determined that the university's
greenhouse failed to meet standards
and advised that the univei'Sity eitherv
install panic hardware on some doors or
keep these doors unlocked, The univer
sity instead proposed to keep the doors
locked only when the greenhouse was
not in use. The Office 01 the Fire
Prevention Supervisor accepted this
proposal.

Walker stated that only Mears Hall
was determined unsafe lor any use. on
campus houses, however, received a
lair number of citations, which the ad-
ministration will "take care of right
away," Walker said.

The Office of the Fire Prevention
Supervisor has not conducted a lull in-
vestigation on campus since the late
"603. The oflicials have been on campus
a few times in recent years.
