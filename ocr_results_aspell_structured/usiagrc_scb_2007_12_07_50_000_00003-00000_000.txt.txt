Naughty or nice? Hildebrand takes Sears to task

Students travel to Coralville to voice concerns about corporate waste to holiday shoppers, employees and mall security

It’s only recently that I've realized I am an
cny'irOiuiieittalist, Prior to this year I thought,
unfairly, that emviromncntalists were unrealistic
and idealisticipeople who cared more about
trees than humans. I certainly didn't tinder-
stand why people stood outside buildings and
yelled. This year, however, I've learned much
more about the environmental movement and
its tactics. As it turns out, environmentalists, or
at least the sort I identify with, are thoughtful
and are opposed to the destruction of our nat~
uml resources, which affect humans, animals
and plant life alikeThat IS the sort Ofdesrluv
tion a group otnine Grinnell college students
protested this past weekend at the Sears in the
coral Ridge Mall.

Our group, comprised mosrly of Free the
Planet! members, protested scars in conjuncr

'rion with a national campaign organized by
ForestEthics, a San Flanciseorbased environs
mental group where I worked this summer.
seals greatly contllbutes to forest destrncr
tion by sending out an estimated 425 million
catalogs a year. These catalogs are printed on
paper with almost no postrconsumcr recycled
content, and the company refuses to make real
commitments to protect endangered forests.
Obviously, then, Sears policy~or lack there-
ofieffects plant and animal life.

However, the logging also directly affects
humans in that it destroys land currently and
historical inhabited by Canadian First Na-
tions’ groups and contributes (0 global warm-
ing by chopping down our world's ﬁrst defense

have a lot to protest when it comes to sears
paper policy, and it’s been proven that the best
way to get corporations to change their ways
is to attack their brand image and get to their
consumer base on board.

To that end, the nine ofus bundled up and
headed to Coralville with homemade catalog
pom—poms in tow, to chant, cheer, and generals
1y make a fuss in front
of Sears. We chanted
about Sears’s part in
forest destruction and
performed cheers to
the tune of“Hot In Here” that accused Sears
of contributing to global warming by destroys
ing forests. Itwas only a little ridiculous, given
the outside temperature of approximately 25
degrees. It turns out Seals, despite its status as
the fourth largest corporation in the country, is

It may be below 30 degrees outside, but for
the Student Environmental and Waltz Corn»
mittees, that’s no reason to forget about global
warming. That’s why both committees have
teamed up to make sure the most popular col-
or at this year's Winter Waltz is green. So far,
these efforts have had mixed results. A cloth—
ing swap planned to recycle old Waltz ties and
dresses produced a low turnout, but plans to
purchase green tags have moved forward sucr
cessfully.

After two years of being considered too
ambitious by Waltz organizers, plans to bring
sustainable environmental practices are ﬁnally
being realized. The SEC approached Wall-e
chair Erlcca Reavis '08 earlier this “mes,
ter about working together to plan Waltz, “I
went to one of their meetings and we talked
about the different things we could do to make
Waltz green,” said Reavis.The foremost ideas
that emerged from these meetings were to
purchase green tags to make up for Grinncll’s
lack ofa clean energy source, reuse decorations
from previous dances and host a dress and tie
swap.

The recycling ofold decorations and dress-
es didn’t go quite as well as planned, however.
Many of the decorations stored in the ACE
closet were too damaged to be reused, making

not a particularly popular store, so foot traffic
was sparse. I think we all wondered if we were
really doing any good,

After a bit we den
cided to up the ante and
head inside the mall.
Based on my experience
protesting in San Frans
cisco I figured we would get kicked out within
a minute, but apparently mall security at the
Coralvillc mall is not as wellrequipped for pro
testers,We held our big sign that stated “Scars
has been naughry"7hopefully Santa gets the
messageiand chanted in the mall for close to

the purchase of several new strands of Christ-
mas lights necessary “If people take better care
of the ACE closet stuff then that will reform
the longevity of the items in general," said
Reavis.

A tie and dress swap last Sunday also pro-
duced lackluster results. “It was a sad turnout,“
said SEC member Heidi Conner '09, noting
that this was probably due to apprehension
surrounding the lending and borrowing of per
tentially expensive clothing items.

“I don’t personally know very many people
who would loan out a dress,"said Reavis.

Much of the impetus behind the greening
ofVValtz came from Conner, who had wanted
to organize an environmentally friendly dance
since her high school’s own “Green Prom,"
where the buying ofnew dresses was outlawed,
all food was local and energy was provided bya
solar pancl."ltwas a really fun thing," she said.
“I was like, ‘Whoal Let's do this at Grinnelll'"

currently, the SEC is in the final stages of
purchasing green tags, certiﬁcates that can be
purchased at a price equal to that of the me
ergy being consumed. The money is then put
towards the development and use ofrenewable
energy, so for every dollar of “unclean"energy
being used, a dollar of clean energy is being
produced.

In order to purchase the appropriate

10 minutes before mall security approached
us. They were, as fellow protester Ali Sargent
'10 put it, "excited but not amused.” Kicking a
bunch ofcollege kids out ofthe mall was prob-
ably the most exciting thing they would do all
month.

We left red-faced and enthusiastic. I have
to admit that having the security guards shuf-
ﬂc us offrhc property was a little cxcitiugl got
old folkic songs about direct action and protest
stuck in my head. It capped offthe action well.
Later I found out that John Burrows '10 had

find them.

Although we did our action on Sunday,
this Tuesday was ForestEthics's ofﬁcial day of
action against Sears, 1 received an email stat—
ing that over 70 actions were planned on that
day alone.

It’s thrilling to be a part ofsomerhiug that
big. It may not seem like a few activists in
lawn getting kicked out ofa mall would re—
ally inspire a big corporation like sears to help
protect endangered forests, but in conjunction
with hundreds of other activists across the
United States and Canada, as past campaigns
have provedwe have a good shot.

amount of tags the SEC asked Environmerr
tal Coordinator Chris Balr to calculate the
amount of energy used at an average Harris
party. Bait noted that total energy consump-
tion during a Harris party is about the same
as on a regular day, because while electricity
usage goes up, natural gas use goes down as a
result ofinctcased body heat.

Other plans include providing locally
grown food for the orchestra and sound techr
nician, as well as possibly placing recycling
bins in Harris tor the plastic cups. Even with
these plans, however, there are concerns. “The
problem with having recycling bins around is
people arejust going to throw trash in them,"
said Rcavis. “lfyou could train people at Harr
ris then I feel like it would be a really good
idea.”

While this dance will be the first "green"
dance to be held at Grinncll, Conner hopes
that Waltz will generate support for more en—
vironmentally friendly Harris parties. “1 would
love to see that happen," she said. “But that
velocity and energy has to come from the stur
dcnr body and the administration."

For Reavis and Conner, the greening of
Waltz is intended to promote sustainable pracr
tices without interfering with partygoer’s fun.

“That's the main point of this,” said Cons
net. “We can still have fun and be green."
