The alumni meet is an impoitant and lasting, though
unorthodox, tsadition fur the Grinnell swimmess.

Accmding to Dan Kasney lot, the goals oi the meet aie
"to huild team unity, not only within the psesent team, but
with past teams" and “[to] show new swimmers what the
Mad Dog and Mad Duck tsaditions ass all about.”

A sesoid as alums aie expected to attend this years
event. Head coach Erin Husley explained the foimat of the
meet.

”We divide up the alums and sin team into odd and even
yeass of graduation oi intended giaduation," she said “and
then go head to head in selays. Each ieiay has to have a
least one alum in it.”

The diving team, accoiding to Stayer, expects ”to pull
togethes a silly routine." stayes hopes ians will come to
watch the pop can seiay, in which all team memheis,
ineliisiing divers, participate on one of six selay teams. Each
swimmet must transport a can of pop one length of the
pool (25 metevs), without using theis hands or theis
swimsuits, though only aim the entise team dances the
hokey pokey in advance. Once the team anchoi sompietes
his/hes lap, he/she must cling the entire can of pop to
claim victory. Aseosding to stayes, the race is filled with
madness and sainpant cheating, but even/one enjoys the
sight at a teammate swimming assoss the pool with a pop
can clenched between his teeth.

To sap it off, there’s a game of odd-yeas vs. even—yeai
water polo, and this Grinnell masteis meet featuring
community swimmers is and up on Sunday at 9 am
