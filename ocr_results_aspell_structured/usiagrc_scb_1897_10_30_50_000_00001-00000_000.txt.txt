Last Year's Score wiped Out!

Score, l2 to 6.

“Besides. we beat you so had last tail
that it absolutely necessary the -ccotd
will hold good ior another _\'ca OLI‘.
DAVIDSON.

The above quotation we clip
from a letter written by Manager
Davidson oi the Ames team to
Manager Beyer of the Grinnell
team, No doubt it rrrll be gaul
and wormwood to the Ames mane
ager to remember the many sltirs
he has cast at Grrrinell’s prowess
on the football Field, because, for
sooth. Ames was so fortunate as
to defeat us by a large score last
year. Grinnell is particularly joy»
ous over the victor-y because or
this letter and because of the
overwhelming defeat of last year
being avenged. Tire day was an
ideal one, No wind whatever and
just cool enough to be comfort»
able tor both players and specia-
tors. of whom there were ﬁve linu-
dred.

Grinnell took Ames off its feet
at the start, making gain after
gain in quick succe The
play was tast and lur-ious, plays
iollowrng each other in quick sud
cession until the ball was carried
overthe line by Gray. Gray made
a magniﬁcent run or 40 yards
around Ames' left end. This was
the longest run of the day. The
superiority in weight of the Ames
men told heavily on their more
slender opponents. And had they
continued the tactics used by them
in the last part of both halves,
that of mass playing the scores
might have been different,

The geilcralship of Captain
Cogges‘nall was srrpcrb tor the
most part, especially dtiring the
last half when his men were not-
ably weakening, He punted suce
cesstnlly time and time again. No
punts were blocked and the tulle
back was downed in his tracks.

But two men were compelled to
leave during the game. Gardner
being substituted for Hart whose
ankle was sprained and Rule for
Norris
