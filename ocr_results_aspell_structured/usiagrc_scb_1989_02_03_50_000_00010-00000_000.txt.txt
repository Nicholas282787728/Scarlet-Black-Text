This Whole Thing -- Winter Break 5G,...“

Every time I listen to REM}:
Green, I weep. I mean. at leastI
think about it. At least for side
one. Which is saying a lot for a
band on the verge of

nothing. Don’t ask me what I
mean by “this whole thing."

Yet every time I
hear the words “President” and
“Bush" uttered in the same breath,
every time I see them typed with

that to impress you. either.

And I don’t care. Last year
marked the l8th consecutive
sutnmer I was passed over {or
Mtiyortcaguc Baseball’sAll-Star
Game. It was also the first year I
had an opportunity to exercise the
one true democratic right I had in
a household without cable TV: I
voted. Neither incident seemed to
affect reality in any profound or
even discernible way.

There are those who will dis-
agree: in had indeed beenchosen
for the All-Star Game, it would
havesurely meant that many more
strikeouts for (your team ’5 pitcher
here.) And had I not voted, Don
Redfem's defeat would not have
been so profound, and perhaps
Dukakis' thatmneh morcso. And,
they will add, if enough people
held my beliefs, this nation would
no doubt be headed for hell on a
lutndcart. Maybe they do: maybe
we are.

Or maybe we aren't. I don't

found them in Florida. And sun

couldn’t tell me from really weak
coffee.

Largely because it’s the sortof

something was done. Actually,
we had nothing to do with it: it
must've been Buddha. Or one ol
his friends. In any case we found
out the Circle Jerks were playing
Somewhere in Florida.

We didn’t know where they
werepaying;wefoundoutwhcrc.
We didn‘t know where to get tickr
ets; we found out how. We didn't
know how to get there; and, yes,
we did. And we weren't too late.

The Circle Jerks are what you
mightcallaseminalhardcoreband,
or maybe you’djustcall lliemjerks.
I once owned the Repo-Man
soundtrack, so I know two of their
songs, putting me one up on the
three other people in the car.

As this band could be called
seminalhardcorc,thcre were what

there, too, These were security
men and youjustknew they played
football in high school, even
though they knew better. Truc
rebels.

The crowd. some 200 at 15
bucks a shot, was composed of
mostly skinheads and people who
avoided skinheads. Not that they
were menacing or even many, it’s
just they essentially surrounded

finesse and press coverage. But,
hcy, flailing fisu are, excuse mc,
seminal in this gcnrc.

So you’ve got a bunch of skin

doesn't it? Well, kind of. What
you get ts a mass or people strut-
ting the pcrimeicrofdie pit, occt-
stonally crashing into the ritn of
spectators, occasionally getting ti
tooth chipped. A colleague said it
looked like it roller rink, and,
y'know, it did.

But that’s not all: eventually,

wooden barricade ll’lili'klng the cttd
