For many ages, many men have
sought peace, tulfillmenl, and mean-
ing in life and yet they have always
either fallen short or even come
pletely failed in their search. Today,
alert questioning youth aresearch-
ing for these same things but they
are also involved in a quest for
truth and spiritual fulfillment as
well. Those who have found these in
life have been ‘renewed’ and now
know that meaning is added to life
when Christ is added to ltlhus make
ing vulgarity, unlawfulncss, and
drugs unnecessary. Many of lhese
youth are sincerely engaged in active
ities which are geared to exposing
others to Jesus Christ who they have
found is The Only Way, The Only
Truth, and The. Only Life.

Many of these youth who have en—
countered Jesus Christ have organr
ized themselves into groups which
proclaim His periectuess and
uniqueness through talks, poems,
hooks, plays, and even songs. One
of the musical groups which is prEr
sently involved in spreading the
gospel (good news) of Jesus Christ
is LOVE SONG, LOVE sonata an

Trauger Devcries
lowa land Abuse

by Bill. Knecht

David Trauger of Iowa State Unis
versity, Executive Secretary of the
Iowa Confederation of Environmene
tal Organizations (lCEo), spoke to
groups of environmentallyecon—
scious students recently,

I attended the first two discussions,
the first concentrating on envircnr
mental problems native to Iowa and
on what can and is being done to deal
with them, Mr. Trauger stated that
land abuse and misuse are the big
gest environmental problems lowa
has to handle. Since it is primarily

agricultural rather than industrial, .

Iowa suffers less from problems of
industrial chemicals and human
waste disposal and more from farm-
related chemical runoff and erosion
problems.

Trauger stated that, with the ad-
vent of modern mechanized farm
machinery, more caloric energy is
being expended in the farming pro-
cedure than is extracted from the
land at harvestime. ‘

The second discussion centered
around career possibilities for en-
vironmentally - minded citizens.
Thousands of jobs will evidently be
opening up for geologists, hydrolo-
gists, ecologists, chemists and other
professional specialized
Very little seems to be in store for
the average citizen,

Both discussions dealt with the
present methods of dealing with
destructive environmental prace
tices. As things stand now, the bulk
of ecological activism is being Carr
ried out by semirautonomous, atos
mistic local groups of concerned cit-
izens, There is very little in the way
of institutionalized federal or state
bodies which can either prohibit
present environmental degradations
or prevent new ones from occurring
