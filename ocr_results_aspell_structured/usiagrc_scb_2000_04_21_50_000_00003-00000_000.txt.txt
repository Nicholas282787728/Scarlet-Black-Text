IMF/WB, cont. from p. 1

rhe debr oi rhe mosr impoverished counrries in Africa, Asia, and
Larin America.

Each day orrhe subsequent week was packed wirh mulriple orher
evens rhar all addressed somehow rhe ramiﬁcarions ofgloballzas
rion. There was a rally for human righrs in Colombia, an Economic
“Way ofrhe Cross," a demonsrrarion againsr Permanenr Normal
Trade Relarions for China, lMF/WB for Beginners, a Green Parry's
porlucksupper, a World Bank Boycott benehr coneerr, a Forest Ac-
rivisr meering, a Procession and Vigil ro Srop rhe Evictions in a DC
neighborhood, and a larin American solidariry Conference, ro name
just a few oirhe oprions for rhe week.

The dcmonsrrarions broughr rogerher sreelworkers, environmene
ralisrs, paeiﬁsrs, human rights acrivisrs, religious groups, organic farm-
ers, anarchisrs, and AIDS aerivisrs. Vererans for Peace, Grandmath»
ers for Peace, and rhe AFL—CIO helped rilr rhe age demographic
away from the large number ofszudenrs,T1-ie crowd was nor exclu-
sively whire, rhough die movemenr’s errorrs ro mobilize more people
oleolor had nor mer wirh as much success as rhey'd hoped.

A vasr array ofendorsers oirhe movemenr for “human need, nor
eorporare greed" were unired under rhe group Mobiliaarion for Glo»
bal lusriee, which asserrs rhar “the ME rhe World Bank and rhe
WTo are undemocraric insrirurions dominared by corporare inter-
esrs rhar seek ro eonrrol our food, our work, our informarion, and
our lives.

Under rhe guise ofalleviaring poverry, World Bank and IMF
loans have forced impoverished eounrries ro our social services and
basic food subsidies and rum rheir communiries inro planrarions ..
. . For millions rhis means poverry, prisons, srarvarion, environmcn»
ral desrrucrion, exploirarion (especially ofwomen) and dearh." Evie
denee for die devasraring elieers olrhese insrirurions ranged from
rhe 1992 economic disasrer in Russia afrer rhe IMF‘s inrervenrion,
ro rhe environmenral damage and human righrs abuses alleged ro be
coming in rhe wake ofa proposed World Bankrunded Chadl
Cameroon oil pipeline projecr.

For the proresrers, one of rho main problems wirh IMF/WE
philosophy is rhar, when giving a loan, rhey force eounrries ro ad.
here ro “srruerural adiusrmenr programs" which are supposed ro be
good for rhe eounrrys economy, bur also include require reduced
governmenr spending, lowering rrade barriers, privarnarion ofpubv
lie services, and high inreresr races. These policies rend ro be derrir
menral to viral social services and increase rhe gap berween rich and
poor.

The IMF, on rhe orher hand, says on wwwimrorg rhar ir was
“established to promore inremarional monerary eooperarion, ex-
change srabiliry, and orderly exchange arnngemcnts; ro losrer eco.
nomic growrh and high levels oiemploymenr; and re provide rem»
porary financial assisranee to countries under adequare safeguards
to help ease balance of paymenrs adjustment. The World Bank,
wwwworldbankorg, says ir “uses irs ﬁnancial resources, irs highly
rraincd scarf, and irs exrensive knowledge base to individually help
each developing counrry onro a parh ofsrable, susrainable, and eq-
uirable growrh." s

The institutions, in rheir meerings and lirerarure, give a nod
now and rhen ro rhe demands oftheir eriries, bur do nor direcrly
address any oftl-ie speciﬁc critiques. lr somerimes seems like rhe rwo
sides or she issue are speaking a dirrerenr language: aerivisrs per a
human race on rhe issues, and ending environmenral and human
desrruerion is rheir borrom line.

The IMF and World Bank ohen use more arcane economic rerms
rhar don’r speak ro your average person, bur rhey rake a more long»
termebcneﬁts, hard-line view ofwhat’s necessary for poverry reduc—
rion, wirh whar seems like a rriekledown philosophy.
