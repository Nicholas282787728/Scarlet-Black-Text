Mr. and Mrs. C. W. H. Beyer
Entertain.

Mr. and Mrs. C. W. H Beyer cur
tel'tainetl very pleasantly Saturday
evening at their home on High St.
The event was a surprise to their son.
Harold L.,on the occasion or his
birthday anniversary. The prelimi~
llaries hart evidently been well manip~
aimed. for the Victim was taken en-
tirely llnawales. Accompanied by
H. H. Stlpp, chiet accomplice to the
plot. Mr. Beyer returned from an
evening call about 8:30 o’clock and
found his abode invaded by about
thirty student friends. The, melan-
clloly intclligerlce of Ames victory at
Minneapolis had somewhat suppres-
sed the spirits of the company, but it
sooll ceased to be a topic of collverr
saiioll and from there on merriluent
was the order.

The early evening was spent in
C(‘lllVElSﬂthIl and games of an lmr
pl‘omptu order on the. ﬂoor. About
10 o’clock the Eclian Mandolin Club
arrived arid “discoursed sweet music”
for an hour. Partners for refresh-
ments were chos l by matching slips
of paper, one. containing the name of
a modern author. and the other one
of his works. After a short musical
program the guests expressed assur-
ance of a most delightful evening alld

'departed at an hour hard by the Salt-

bath.
