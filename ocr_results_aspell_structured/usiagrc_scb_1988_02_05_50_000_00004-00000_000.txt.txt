New RA Dave Clark

by Bruce Emund

You might be iorgiven ior think-
ing that band Clark, the new resi-
dent adviser tor Haines and
James, is actually the old 19605
rock star, attracted to the college
by the pastoral simplicity oi Iowa
liie. Do not expect, however,to see
Clark warbling a iew bars irom
“Glad All Over" in liector's and
don't go searching in his room ior
the missing iive.

Thls Dave Clark, a lot younger
than his iamous namesake. is a
native oi leiicrson, a small town in
western lowa. He has a BA. in ar-
chitecture irom lowa State and an
M5 in student personnel work
irom lndiana State University,
where he also worked in the oiiice
oi the dean oi students

Clark cites Grinnell‘s location
and its small size as big attractions
tor him, “It‘s in Iowa and in a

small town i wanted those things.
1 think people are a lot more
iriendly and caring here [than in a
cityi. All my experiences were at
large state institutions, but i-
wanted to see what it would be like
at a small liberalsarts school,”
Clark's specialty is leadership
development, and he hopes that his
“Grinnell Experience" will be
beneiiciai to his iield oi study "I'd
like to be a generalist in my iield. l
think this is deiinitely a stepping
stone to that because i will have a
lot mor'e counseling experiences."
he said

Clark‘s hobbies are water ski g.
running, biking, swimming, and
other activities which allow him to
be outdoors He has enjoyed his
iirst iew weeks at Grinnell. “1 like
it a lot," said Clark “I'm very
busy here. llike seeing the diversi»
ty oi the students, and I’ve liked
everyone I've met "

Gay Life

or resources away irom the pure
chasing oi art works to the more
immediate problem oi AIDS
research, “in New York iive years
ago there were five gav art
galleries. They have all closed
down except ior one," said Saslow.
“People just don't have the money
to support gay art like they used to.
The money they would have used is
now going to A1DS."Sasluw states
that the sDeCter of AIDS looms
ominously over all aspects or gay
llle. not just the art world. “The
money is going to AIDS and not
other gay organizations like. ior
example, the Lesbian Archivist
Association. That's not to say those
organizations aren't as wor-
thwhlle. bu! jusl that AIDS
research is a much more wore
thwhile cause. Everyone knows sus
meone who is sick,"

Saslow pointed out that while
gays have made strides in accep-
tance as a minority gmup. they
still must combat the inevitable
conservatism 01' many institutions.
He cited in particular The New
York Times, which, until recently,

headline “There was an article in
The Times a iew days ago about
Civil Rights groups. They were
careiul to list every minority group
there is 7 women. the handicap-
ped. the elderly, blacks v but they
did not even mention gays, That is
overlooking about 25 million peo-
ple,”

Ale and the accompanying rise
in ‘iag bashing,‘ evidenced by the
claims oi some religious iigures
that the disease is a iorm or divine
retribution against homosexuals.
have diminished many oi thesocial
andpoiitical advances made by the
gay rights movement in the 19705.
Saslow was recently appointed to
the Center for lesbian and Gay
Studies oi City University in New
York City, and Yale University has
plans to establish a similar gay
research center, Saslow is 01.37
timistic tor the iuture. although
this is tempered by the realization
that the struggle to eradicate
stereotypes and misconceptions
about gays will be long, and one
made more diiiicult by the
emergence oi AIDS,

“Attitudes have changed a great
deal but not enough," said Saslow.
. “The kinds oi opposition today are
much more subtle, but they still
represent an ignorance Ten years
ago we were really moving (or-
ward, changing attitudes. building
our own institutions and strong
communities. We are still doing
those things. but this plague has
slowed down the development oi
gay culture. In the long run We will
keep on going, but some oi us ieel a
little more tired, and our resources
are stretched a little thinner."
