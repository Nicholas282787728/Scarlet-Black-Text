PROSPECTS FOR FOOTBALL

Large Number of Promising Candidates
Fisk will Coach for the
Present.

Iowa College people all lenllzc
that prophesies in regard to foot

in a state so large and productive
of football material as this of ours.
are at best only interesting {lights
otimagination. There are, how
ever. always indications that point
toward a successful season, or to
one of disaster. Early as it is,
indications of this order are many
and pleasing. Enough of last
year‘s Varsity men are again can
didates to insure a nuclelis of vet-
erans, who together with the suc-
cesstul ones amongthe newcomers
are bound to do credit to the scar-
let and black,

Captain Van Llew, Aurachcr,
Tool, Dack, Fuller and Smith of

Among them are Carson, Cailson,
and Dorail of East Des Moines.

last year's Shattuclt team that won
an early season game from the
giants oftlie Minnesota University.
and Handel who playedtacirlehere
in tool. A good many other men
from some of the strong looz high
school teams of the state are out,
Gilley and Barber ofGrinnell will
also be among the candidates.

The most encouraging feature
of the situation, notwithstanding
all that has been said before. is
the fact that not a position on the
Varsity is assured. Every man
will be forced to play to his limit
to earn a position and he must do
his best if he expects to hold it.
The whole squad is determined as
never betore, and the warm scrap
tor places on the team will surely
have its effect in the strength of
the aggregation.

The team promises to be un~
usually heavy. Half a dozen of
the candidates weigh about two
hundred pounds apiece.

“Tuffy” Fisk, '02, is to coach
the team until the arrival of Erick-
son ot Wisconsin, who will be
head coach for the season.

 

OUR NEW PROFESSORS

List or Men Who have Come to Slay
or to Fill Temporary
Vacancies.

For the ﬁrst time iii many years
the old student may sit in the
auditorium at chapel and count
on the platform thcre almOSt as
large a proportion of strange faces
among the faculty as the professor
sees of students in the audience.
Although many readers will have
to become acquainted with the
new instructors ina far better way
than they can be introduced
through the columns ofa college
paper, SctltLET AND BLACK takes
theliberty, at the risk of partially
repeating itself, of reviewing the
names and coupling them with
the positions the new members
are to Fill.

Professor Steiner occupies the
chair ot Applied Christianity and
has accepted it as a permanent po-
sition. Professor Bruce Fink of
Botanyand Geology may betound
inthelabratorieslromg:t5totislg
any college day. l’crcy B. Bur-
nett whose history appears else-
where in this issue, will take
Professor Nollen’s place at the
head of the modern language
department. willie Mr. Alden
takes Professor \Vhltcomb's place
in the English work Miss Emma
H. Griswold has been secured as
instructor in piano and Mr. w. P.
Ryan holds the newly created pos

public speaking. He is also to
take charge of the two houi class

the roll.

___._
PLAY FOOTBALL.

Now is the time for every
good Grinnell man to rally to
the support of his football team,
The quality of the Varsity rests
upon the co operation of the men
of Iowa College. All new men
should realize that there is no
better opportunity to get the ex
perience necessary to a good
football player than that offered
every night on Ward Field.

For the third team there will be
opposition to the high school and
perhaps games will be arranged
with some ofthe neighboring high
schools. Let every man regard
the success of this year’s football
team as resting upon his shoulders
as a personal responsibility, and
let those who can meet this re
sponsibility by coming out and
helping the Varsity.
