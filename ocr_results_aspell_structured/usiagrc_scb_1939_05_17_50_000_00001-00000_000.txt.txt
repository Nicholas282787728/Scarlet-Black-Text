Technique for

Cagey Romance .

How can an ordinary college
.loe take steps to keep his girl
from stepping out with other
guys? Well, if he’s resourceful
enough, and if he has a classical
mind, he might pretend he’s a
ghost. If you are at all skepti-
cal as to the results of this for~
mula, you have only to witness
the Men's Glee club‘s spectacular
production of “Cleopatra'Lan
opera burlesque to be presented
Friday night.

Great Caesar! What with Mark
Antony, the football hero, Pom—
pey, the campus “sheik," and
Caesar, an ex-athiete from Mich»
igan, all vying for the love of
Cleo, campus queen, the situa-
tion becomes rather strained.
But because there once was an
old Pharaoh named King Tut, and
because Bill, the ordinary stu-
dent, is smart enough to realize
it, young love triumphs at the
finale.

It’s got rhythm, it's got music'
And it's got that serpent of the

'Cleopaira'
To Be Given

Burlesque, Russian,
And Shakespearean
Songs Will Be Sung

The Grinnell college Men’s Glee
club will present its fortyrfiftll
annual spring concert Friday evc-
hing at 8 p. in. in Herrick chapel.

The group, under the direction
of F. Walter Huffman, will pre-
sent a varied program which in—'
cludes a. group of Russian songs,
a group of Shakespearean num—
bers, a solo by Blake stern, and
an opera burlesque of college life,
“Cleopatra.”

The cast of the opera, which

will highlight the program, in

orous Cleopatra; George Infelt’
as William, the college student in
love with Cleopatra; George
Thomas as ”Antony,” the football
hero of the campus; Kenneth
Shoulberg as “Caesar" and Philip
Bridghsm as “Pompey,"

The story of the opera burr
lesque is built around the modern-
ized Egyptian coed, Cleopatra.
She is engaged to the student,
William; but Antony, the college
football hero, Pompey, a campus
“sheik," and Caesar, an ex-ath-
lete, arc all in love with her.
William, her sweetheart, laments
the attentions which Cleo is re-
ceiving from the other men; and
he determines to disguise himself
as a ghost in order to frighten
away the competitors for Cleo’S
affections. William succeeds in
convincing the trio of suitors
that Cleo is "haunted.” In the
end he wins Cleo back after the
trio has died of grief and he has
saved Cleo from suicide by reveal,
ing he is not the ghost, but her
lover, William

The Russian songs have typi-
cal Russian themes of courage
in the face of sadness and perse-
cution. In contrast, the Shake
spearean numbers are light and
fast—moving, making use of the
theme of spring.

Semester fee books and recital
cciirse tickets will admit students.

‘C/lild Marriage’ and ‘Vincent Van Cog/7’ Considered
Intelligent Presentations Showing Writers’ Maturity

 

By Carl Niemeyel‘.

The two original plays presented
Friday and Monday by the de-
partment of drama were “child
Marriage” by Ruth Schulte and
“Vincent Van Gogh” by Margaret
Currier. Each was an intelligent
presentation of a theme demand-

otic subject, was convincing. As
Grinnell has come to expect of
productions of the department,
this one was well staged and well
directed,

 

of the two plays Miss Curri-l

er's, rather unfortunately den
scribed on the program as a
verseplay, with its dramatize:
tion of the conflict bctiveeo the
artist and society, was the better
developed. It placed, to be sure,
a heavy burden on the actors;

but one felt that, defects in the

ing considerable maturity of the l Playing were not due to any tail.

writcr: each, in spite of its ex—I

ure of the performers to under»
stand what they were doing but
rather to an inevitable lack of
professional experience.

Mary Shaw as the peasant

mother did a nice bit of acting;
so too did Joe Wall in the diffi-

cult rolc of van cogh, and Mary
Whetstone as the peasant girl,
Both in this play and Miss
Schulte‘s, however, the voices oc-
casionally became shrill and un-
naturally pitched,

“Child Marriage" presented a
problem with considerable oppor-
tunities for sentimentality. Hap—
pily these opportunities were ne-
glected by both Miss Schulte and
the cast. The actors gave an
even performance, each one reads
ing his lines well. Perhaps to
.lean Crooks and Elaine Hummel
should go chief honors, however.
