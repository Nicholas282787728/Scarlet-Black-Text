The ﬁrst meeting of the spring
term was called to order by Mr.
Crabb, with a full attendance. Mr.
Hays and Mr, Risser escorted Mr
Douglass, the presidentelect, to
the chair. who reccrvcd the gav l
from the retiring president. Mr,
Douglass then opened the evens
ing's program not ivitli a “cut and
dried inaugural address. but with a
few hints as to society work ”We
are at the beginning ofa newepocli
in society work. We have estab.
lislied our supremacy in athletic
and scholastic training and have a
good chance to do so In society
work. All we need is the support
of the student body such as we re
ceive in athletic contests. Let all
who go lrito oratory or debate go
in not for personal ends btit tor the
college. This will be the salvar
tion of our society work.”

Mr. McCarty toltowed wrth a
book review on “Caleb West,"by
F. Hopkinson Smith. Selections
were read showing his style, rnle
lowed by a \ve1l~ivrittcn criticism
on the work as a whole.

Mr. Hays gave a \vellrprepared
speech on “The Scientiﬁc Spirit."
”Each period or history l5 charace
terized by some dominating spirit
of the people l-U'diu' it is the
scientiﬁc spurt l'lic V’pltu ul Inr
vestigation,” The greater paitot
his talk was devoted to the uses
made of electricity, xerays and liqr
uid air. Thesayitigthat“necessity
is the mother of invention" is no
longer the ivliolc trttth; it can just
as truly be said in this age that
“the scientiﬁc spirit is now the
mother of invention."

Mr. Parks, appearing tortlietirst
time on the ﬂoor of the society,
gave a very welhwt'ttten paper on
the “Value of the Study of Liter-
ature." “All that is written is not
literature, It rntrst present higher
qualities to be enduring. Its value
lies in rts ameliorating inﬂuence."

Extemporaneous work was done
by Messrs, Meade, Owen and o.
Risser. Meade spoke of “Friday
Morning's Chapel l‘allr;" Owen

 

on "Kipling's ViSit to Anicricag”
o. Rrsser gave us a tew comments
on “Recent Elections."

Debate—Resolved: That the
partition or China among EtlI'Or
peari powers would be justiﬁable
Mr. Cruikshank held that all nae
tions are not destined to be ruling
nations. The Teutonic is the rule
ing race; China is politically ins
capable and it rs our duty to thrust
civilization upon her. Thiswould
be tor her good and would be a
beneﬁt to the commerce or the
world. Mr. Arnold tor the nega.
tive said this would shut off Uni-
ted States commerce and inﬂuence
and would tirirr China over to Rus
sra, Gcrnmtiy and France, \\ ho do
not show as good statecratt as the
United 5 ties. The way to civil-
ize China is through education, in
which Arnerrca is taking a leadrng
pat-t Force cannot be a CIVIIIZ'
ing factor. China isalready wait»
ing to a sense otthc need or change,
which is shonn by frequent revolt
against the existing government
The chair demdcd in favor of the
afﬁrmative,

Mr. John P, Gavitl, who is in
close touch with the working peo»
pie or Chicago, gave an trtstIUCr
tive talk in the chapel last Mon~
day evening. He tool: tor his
subject, “The Obligations of Cul-
ture,” His message was an appeal

It ls a great mistake to suppose
that the everyday working peo-
ple do not want culture. When
once their interest is aroused
along the lines of ctilturc, their
interest in it grows to such an ex
tent that they eagerly arid proﬁts
ably stiidy sitch books as Herbert
Spencer and,Joliii Stuart Mrll.
Such interest manifested by the
working classes constitutes true
culture.

The working people are eager
and anxious to tollow the guide
arrce or cultured people- Hence
it is obllgittory tor all such, col-
lege students particularly. to teach
these people culture in order to
bring them to better citizenship
and larger \ervice.

Amendments to the Honor
System.

In response to the call of the
Student's Council for a mass meet-
ing, about forty students assem~
bled in the chapellast evening,‘to
the proposed amend-
ments to the Honor System. The
meeting was called to order by R,
D. Douglass. chairman ot the Stu-
dents” Council. and W. S, Lyman
was elected chairman. Alter a
general statement as to the object
or the meeting, three amendments
to the constitution were proposed.
With almost no disc'ussion these
amendments were passed by a
vole of (Wentymlne to tour,

These changes in the constitUr
tion are important and ought to
have called fririh rtlure Interest on
the p ut or the strident body. The
constitution as it now is, provides
that the system shall be restricted
td the college. that the taculty
shall be relieved of all initiative
cxccpt in cases of written work,
and that charges may be preierr-ed
upon the testimony of only' one
witness.

It is believed by the members
of the Students’ Council that these
changes will add greatly to the
effectiveness of the system.

Caps and gowns will not be
ivorri by the seniors of the Univer-

sity of Wisconsin this year. This
was the decision reached at a class
meeting a tow days ago. No dcfe
irrite reason is assigned further
than the fact that it does not seem

reasonable to-do so when the tac-
ulty retuse to wear them.
