Ames came, saw, and conquered in

warriors on \Yal'd Field, yesterday at-
ternoon, returning home with the long
end of a _ score. For six long in-
nings they were denied the fruits ot

they stored the game away in their
balrsacks, fattening their batting av-
erages considerably in the process.

New Stars—Points Should Be

with Allies defeated by Drake iii the
annual dual last Saturday by a count
of 6m to 62%, and Crinnell estab-
lished Conference champion with a
tour-point margin over Coe in the
meet at Cedar Rapids on the same day,
all dope points to a hard fight for
honors between these four institu-
tions in the annual state classic next
Saturday at Des Moincs.

A comparison of events ' the two
meets last Saturday is suffi cnt foul-14
dation for the conclusion that points
in the big state event will be well di-
vided tip. The conference athletes set
markedly better time in the sprints,
run and relays than the contestants
in the AmeSrDrake clash, while on
the other hand the latter meet showed
decidedly superior periormantes in
the llzllf and two mile: low hurdles and
all of the tield eients. The high hura
dies went in :16 175 in hoth meets.

have been disposed to favor Allies in

amass pom, in all the events that
went to the Blue and White athletes
