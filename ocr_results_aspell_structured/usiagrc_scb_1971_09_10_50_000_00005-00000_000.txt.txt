The Ugly Young Americans

by Ed Hirsch

For the American freak ‘the
trip' as it‘s said, is to do
Europe as cheaply as possi*
ble. There is a kind of vast
communications underground
which passes on information
about where the best dope
can be found, where living
is cheap, authority lax. And
because the underground realr
ly isn't so underground, thour
sands and thousands of Amer
ricans went heading forSpain,
Morocco, and Greece. (Morn

M Christian Camp

What is it like to live your
life for someone else? How
am you finally and fully be
free from your old self and
your enslavement to others,
and begin to accept yourself
and love and serve others?
Many, including the three of
us, have found that only Jesus’
Christ can do this. We ex-
perienced this summer at
monthrlong Christian leader
ship training camps the come
munity that only the selfless
and revolutionary love of Jen
sus Christ can create.

It was not easy to love each
person as Jesus Christ does,
but knowing the love of Jesus
for ourselves and His patience
with us, we found ourselves
able to be patient with our
friends, concerned for them
without condemnation, and Sli'
rengthened in the discipline
we need in our own lives.
This discipline encompassed
all areas of our lives: Bible
study, prayer, cleaning can
bins, washing dishes, develop-
ing muscles by sailing or
mountain climbing, p‘l‘aying
volleyball as a team, and in
all things trusting God to chi

ange our old nature's self-
ish desires into selfless love.
Sacrifice of time, energy, and
all materialpossessions for one
anodier is possible only when
we let Jesus be the Lord and
Master of all that we are and
have. We know that we can
trust Him with our lives be
cause though He was a man,
He is also fully God. Because
He lived on earth as a man,
He knows the trials we endure
and the temptations we try to
resist. But unlike us, Jesus
never gave in to temptations
by satisfying His own desires
before serving others. Jesus
even took upon himself the guilt
of all men‘s sins, endured
death, and then defeated death
by living again. He wanted to
do this for us because He knew
we were not properly related
to God: the life God intends
for each of us is obscured by
the separation we have made
between ourselves and Godseen
by our lack of love and obe-
dience to God.

There is, however, the possi-
bility of returning to the right
relationships with God by ac
cepting Jesus as, first, the one
who destroyed sin and death
and, secondly, by allowing Him
to use His power to reorient
and direct our lives in the
right way. The regenerate man
is then freed from his selfishr
ness and is given the power
of God to begin to live in love
for God and man.

As all three of us discovered
at camp, the Christian commu-
nity is still not easy. Many
circumstances and vestiges of
our old nature continue to plan
gue us, but a growing relation-
ship with the Lord gives Him
the reins and thus the oppor-
tunity to change our hate to
love and selfishness toservlce.

occo, by rites of extension,
is considered part ofEurope.)
There they visit the islands,
sell beads, blow kief, ‘rip
off' the natives. They congrer
gate with other Americans,
tend to ridicule the people
who don't speak English, and
whine about the underdevelo-
ped conditions, i.e. no hot
showers.

Myth Conli rmed

Before this summer lwas
adverse to characterising the
American youth. It all seemed
like a kind of overgeneralized
myth half created by the mass
media. But set against the
background of Europe numer
rous things come clear.

The most striking though
certainly not the most sur-
prising characteristic of the
American abroad is that he
acts like a spoiled brat. He
is disliked by the people of
the country, mostly because
he is parasitic on me eco»
nomy, tends to steal, create
disturbances, and ridicule rec
ligious rituals. It was for
just these reasons that Franco
cleared the Spanish island of
lbetha of 'hippies'.

Ibetha, you would have been
told hundreds of times this
summer, was the place to go.
Living is cheap and the wear
ther is good. And, as anadded
plus, since Ibetha is a prir
mitive and small island, the
people often leave edible goods
unlocked. Milk is delivered to
groceries and left on the door—
steps and fruitstands are of-
ten covered with unlocked
mrp's. Che of the main ma,
sons Franco felt it necessary
to rid the island of longhairs
was that too manypeople were
stealing food and panhandling
off the peasants.

It is no wonder that the Spa‘
nish are hostile to Americans
who invade their country only
to play at being poor, a bla-
tant kind of sacrilege that is
thrust in the face ofa cul-
ture that really is poor. But
the poverty around him sel-
dom seems to affect the Amer
rican. As far as 1 can see,
he only views it as an op'
portunity to live more cheaply.

Another Exploiter

It is my experience that the
American tourist seldom true
ly observes the country he is
visiting. He seldom speaks
any of a foreign language and
even if he does he usually
attempts to get by in English.
Dressed in the uniform ofwork
shirt, jeans, hair tohis shoul~
ders, no shoes or socks, he
is immediately stereOtyped,
and he stereotypes himself by
ﬂocking to other Americans.
And I found out that people
do use rhetoric like ‘far out’,
‘dig me’, ‘outrageous', and
‘good vibes', seriously. Four
to six words tend to capsu-
lize a whole vocabulary, all
that the American doesn‘tsay,
even to himself.

Which all in all makes a
sad story. The American
freak, once welcomed as a
stranger, has become all too
familiar. What initially ap-
peared as a viable counter-
culture is now typed as sim~
ply another extension ofAmer
rican middle class. At first
the American youth's stand on
Vietnam fooled people. They
expected a more humanistic,
polite, less gross kind of [OU’
rist. But by now Europeans
have learned better. They have
again retreated into theirslo-
gan, 'leave your dollars, but
Yankee go home'.

And in the center of all this
is the Amerimn youth who
has simply become another
symbol of Ameriun exploir
tation.

Barry Zigas
(Forsa, Sweden, Aug. 16, 1971)

The thirty-five students str
udylng Swedish here in Forsa
are more or less isolated from
world events.

”Newsweek" 5 hard to

gar; the Paris edition of the
"Herald Tribune" arrives in
Stockholm so late as to make
it read more like the "News
of the Week in Review" when
it finally gets north.

So, imagine everyone‘s re»
actions as news began to fil*
ter down this morning about
Mr. Nixon's new economic
policies . Some of us were
lucky and heard about it in a
class while trying to trans-
late the early news broads
cast. Others did not know
why the banks wouldn‘t take
their checks until much 1&7
ter.

The comment over Swedish
radio was to the point: the
move was immediately identir
fied as the opening salvo in
Nixon's '72 campaign. The
commentators see himas try-
ing to establish a beachhead
as an economic liberator of
the average American. The
initial reaction was tingedwith
regret over the fact that Nir
xon's plans were incidentally
liable to wreck havoc with
Europe and Sweden for some
time to come.

Rotary Club

This evening the JOCal Ro-
tary Club was scheduled to
visit the student group and
answer questions about Swe-
den. The Club is dominated
by professional and business
men, many of whose liveli-
hoods depend in some way on
import/export trade. Their
concern over "The Speech”
was readily apparent.

One fellow, a highly-placed
employee of the area‘s lead»
ing paper mill, said that in
his considered opinion, Ni»
xon's new policies were dan-
gerous, contrary to at least
one formally stated U.S. tr-
ade policy, and incidentally
signals the end of an era.
The policy he referred to
was that formulated in the
Kennedy Round ofnegotiations
on tariff agreements. At that
time the U.S. came out in
favor ofa long- term effort to
minimize international trade
barriers. The sudden addia
tion of a 10% surcharge on
imported goods was clearly
against that commitment.

The consequences of these
new tariffs and thepolicyre-
versal indicated by them could
be rather serious for Europe
in general, and Sweden in par
ticular. In a country more
or less dependent on export,
as is the case here, a drop
of even 5% in trade due to
new tariff walls is a serious
matter.

Nixon's tinkering with the
dollar further aggravates
the problem. With about $60
billion ﬂoating around here in
Europe, the idea of a sudden
devaluation raised a few eye-
brows.

Reprisals

The Rotary Club saw this as
the end of American dominr
ance of the world’s money
market. "How can there by
any confidence in the dollar
now?" asked one Swede.
“America should have devalr
ued long ago, but instead it
has upset all the Other cur-
rencies before accepting the
inevimble. A sudden, unila-
teral devaluation like this cou-
id be very serious. We can
buy more, certainly, but we
must sell, not buy. And now
that’s going to be even hard-
er with higher tariffs and lOW‘

or exchange. Cur dollars are
suddenly worth a good deal

less; what should we do; thank
you for it?”

(he of the students asked
the Rotarians what Europe
would do in the face of Nir
xon's actions. “Protect her-
self, naturally," a Rotarian
answered. How can Europe do
that’.7 "By doing the same thing
to America," he replied hot-
ly. “We in Sweden have for
some time beenurginga broa-
der organization than the
Common Market to deal with
Europe's economics. We are
not members of the EEC be-
cause of our policy of strict
neutrality. America's rather
high handed attitude will make
such a reorganization more
attractive to otherEuropeans,
I think. The current situation
highlights our helplessness in
the face of U.S. dominance
here. With this latest step,

I think the United States has

ended its predominance here.

It is simply no longer in our
interest to allow the situation

to continue like this."

That is the key, of course,
to the whole problem: self»
interest. It’s a question of
competition, With Amerim
scrambling hard to make its
industries competitive again
at the cost of the working
man and small entrepreneur.
Whether she will succeed re-
mains to be seen. Whether
more expensive Toyotas will
boost employment in the auto
industry also remains to be
se n. It could, of course,prer
cipitate a trade war, with
Europe attempting to do exact-
ly the same thing as the U.S.
for the same reasons. The
Rotary Club didn't think much
of the whole idea, for their
secure welfare state can ill
afford more unemployment.
Nixon's move has shaken them
up; Sweden is edging tovmrds
the idea of international co~
operation on trade. As a
small, highly industrial na~
tion, they really don't seem
to have much choice.

I don’t think we do, either.

Greg Plugs Budget Hearing

by Greg Vranicar
At many colleges, the Student Government Association’s

most important function is to

oversee the allocation of student

funds. Although Grinnell's student body is very active in what
may sometime be considered more glamourous issues, ape
propriation of activity fee funds is one of the most crucial

jobs to be undertaken by S

GA. It is important, since each

student contributes $47 to the fund that will roughly total
$59,000 this year, that everyone understands the budgeting

process and takes part in
and priorities.

determination of budget goals

in the Spring of each school year, a Finance Committee for
the following year is appointed. it is the job of this committee

to study the needs and past
studentrfunded programs on

expenses of each of the various
campus. When its research is

completed, then, the committee submits a proposed budget to
the SGA Joint Board. This year's Finance Committee Chair-
man, George Shybut, will bring to Monday night's meeting
the proposed 1971-72 student government budget, hopeful that

by the end of the evening,

the Joint Board will approve at

least the majority of the committee's recommendations. As
you can imagine, each segment of the proposal will be care
fully scrutinized; the rationale for each item must be ex-

plained by the Finance Commi

ttee.

To what major program areas will funds be advanced?
More than onerhalf of the total (about $33,000) will likely
be allocated to the Social Coordinating Committee for use
in obtaining musical talent, films, and other campus enter-
tainment. If this appropriation is approved the Social Coors

dinating Committee, chaired

this year by Ed Levine, will

have control of these funds. Roughly twenty percent of the
budget (reportedly $11,000) will probably be allocated to the
campus medias-the Starlet and Black newspaper and KDIC
radio. 1f the proposed budget is approved, approximately
$5,000 will be allocated for hall and small group use as
money for dinners, parties, and so forth. It will be proposed.
that anOther $3,000 should be reserved as a "cultural fund
to be used to obtain special Spedkb’l‘S and performers and to
be available, upon application and acceptance, to groups who
need special funding for worthy projects. About $3,000 will
be reserved for administration of the Student Government

Association.

Without considerable input and debate from students about

the budgeting priorities at

Monday’s meeting, it will be

impossible for the Joint Board to make decisions that re*

t‘lect the majority of the stud

ents' wishes. Once the proposal

is approved by the Joint Board, funds are earmarked and

changes

in the budget are rare. All of us should spenda

couple hours Monday night to debate how our money will
be spent in the next nine months.
