Grinnel/ Host To Carleton In Parents' Day Contest

Can Pioneers Rebound From
Emphaﬁc 4270 Ripon Loss?

By Garland

neNclsky

Can a team beaten 420 only last Saturday bounce
back to Win this week'l This will be a question predominant
in the minds of 8 Parents’ Day crowd as the Grinnell foot-
ball team faces a strong Carleton eleven tomorrow after-

noon Game time is 1:30.

Grinnell has compiled a 1-1
record thus far this season, de-
feating Lawrence 25-8, and Sue-
cumbing to Ripon, 42—0. Carle-
ton has won two out of three,
breezing past Monmouth and
St. Olaf and losing to Coe last
week, 14—0. Both teams will be
trying to get on the winning
path again.

Schmuckcr Leads Car-ls

Carleton is led by an out-
standing 165-pound tailback, Al
Schmucker, Norman Miner is
also expected to give an account
of himself against the Pioneers
at fullback. The Carls employ
a multiple offense, although the
majority of their plays are run
from an unbalanced single wing.

Grinnell head football coach
Bob Peterson remarked that a
main Pioneer objective in the
game will be to stop tailback
Schmucker from gaining yard—
age at the rate he has done so
far this season. Schmucker has
averaged over 100 yards per
game. Peterson also commented
that the Car-ls have good team
depth to back up their strong
first unit. Carleton has 17 re
turning lettermen this season.

Pioneers Have Injuries

The Pioneers received a numr
ber of injuries in the Ripon
game which may keep some
players completely out of ac.
tion. Others, undoubtedly, Will
see only limited action. On the
“doubtful" list are linemen Ken
Pap, Roger Smith and Bruce
Wilkerson and backs Bob Woito
and Ernie Rutherford. The loss
of any or all of these men
would certainly dampen hopes
for a pioneer victory against
the earls,

Grinneli will be led in the
groundgaining department by
senior tailback .rohn Copeland
and sophomore iuilhack Jim
Lowry. The defensive unit is
headed by junior guard nick
Yaki. Copeland set a school
total yurdagc record here last
season, collecting a total of
1042 yards.

Paterson declined to make
any predictions concerning the
outcome of the contest but did
state, “We’ll give it everything
We‘ve got," Both teams need
this victory to remain in the
conference race, a factor which
will undoubtedly help produce
quite a contest.

in addition, the Pioneers willl'
be out to avenge a 20:: loss
to Carleton last season. Grin-
nell literally fumbled the game
away, outplaying the earls in
every department except scor-
ing. All these factors set the
stage for a vigorous gri ron

battle tomorrow at Ward field.

Harriers Take 18
Against Ripon's 45
For Third Victory

By Tom Super

G 1‘ i n n ell's cl‘ossccountl'y
team won its third straight
dual meet last Saturday by
defeating Ripon 18 to 45.

.Chuck Yoak repeated his win-
ning ways again, walking off
with top individual honors.
Yoak covered the 2.3 mile asc
phalt course in 14:27. Louis
Sachs notched a Pioneer second
followed by Ripon’s Larson. Art
Risser finished fourth, Fred
Boughey fifth and Grant Fair-
banks sixth to round out the
Grinncll scoring. The harriers
again turned on the gas and
pushed all seven of their 'men in
front of Ripon’s second runner.

Tomorrow afternoon at 1:40
the barriers moot Carleton.
The Grinnellians will be out
looking for revenge oi last
year’s loss to the Carls. Carle<
ton's hopes ride on their two
returning lettermen, Ted
Wahlleld and Bob stemsrud.

There has been a change in
the Pioneer home course within
the last Week. Instead of run-

ning through Merrill park, the,

barriers will go straight up
Park street to the golf course.
The return route is the same.

Next week the Pioneers travel
to Cornell for what should be
the big meet oi the season.

‘ Last weekend I took the opportunity to travel to Ripon,
Wis. With the football team for their football game with the
Redmen. Ripon was Midwest Conference champion last year,

going undefeated through eight
games. They received a national
ranking among small colleges
of the nation.

Taking this into account,
Jerry Gray, team statistician,
and 1 expected to walk into a
relatively spacious stadium and
take our places in a well—heated
press box. Our accomodations
were not quite so idealistic. We
ended up on the top row of
their wooden bleachers with
electric light poles obstructing
our view every 20 yards.
