Gray at Dibble was undoubtedlv the

lot of territory and consistently
backed up both second and thin] base.
Only two errors were chalked up

against him during the season, one on i

grounder that he let slip through his
legs in the last inning of his last
game. Hi5 batting average was .500

his ability at waiting out a pitcher.
He drew three passes the iirst time

There is no doubt thiit melting or
the champs was the (la oi the third
saclrcr.. in the game against Dibble
alone he pulled enough spectacular
phi to land him on most “all" teams.
rind be was consistently good thiough—
out the seas n, lngi-aui oi Dibble was
practically the only other guardian or
the hot corner in the the league who
showed class, and neither his hitting
nor his ticldiug was up to that of Del—
iing, The Building ’i‘hrce ace batted
.500 also, and is placed second in the
‘huttmg liheiip, the slime place lie but:

Ey at bunting.

McClain at Clark hall was one or
the most consistent hitters the season
produced, and be had better luck than
the mainrity at hitting the leading
pitchers, so ior that reason he is
placed third in the batting lineup. He
played shor top and occasionally
pitched on his own team, but at nei-
ther place was be the best in the
league, but he is too good a. hitter to
keep off the team, and is therefore
placed at left held. His betting aver-
age was .454. Culver of Three was al-
sc 9]. good hitter, but he seemed to
have difliculty in reaching left hand
91's, and is not as consistent in field—
ing as some or the others, although
he did pull one or two flashy plays.

There was a dearth of good men in
the outer garden this season; 'those
who were good hitters lacked in
spearing the long high ones, and vice
versa. Moran of Three, by virtue of
is halting average or .552 which led
the league, is placed as cleanup men
in the batting lineup because many at
his clbuts went fur extra bases, and
he knocked in a good many runs, al-
though he looked roolish several
times on ily balls.

Chase, the Dihble center ticldcr, was
perhaps the best uuttlelder the series
produced, and in addition hit for a
percentage of .333. He envered a lot
of territory, and had the best whip of
any of the fly-catchers. Parke, also
of the champs, was the class of the
first suckers, playing errorless hell,
figuring in a couple of snappy double
plays, and hitting tor a mark of .4qo.

The series failed to produce any
outstanding guardian of the keystone
bag. Wolfe, captain at the league
leaders, who played at shortstop and
pitcher, is placed nt second. He was
not as consistent an infielder as Gray
or Dcifing, but he is a good man and
could take his turn in the box with
the regular hurlers. He is made cap-
tain oi the mythical team for leading
his own club to the pennant. He
would probably be as good a. leadoff
man as Gray. and his average was
.333, but for the reason that he would
probably be used occasionally in the
box, he is placed down in the batting
list where his absence would not he-
cessitate ‘too much or a change in the
lineup.

Building Thiec hurler, the result
might have been reversed. Wyatt in
addition is nu excellent infielder, and
hit .454 tor the senscn, so he could be
used to advantage at second when
Waite is called on to pitch. Rogers

well in one game, and had he been in

The crop of good hackstcps was
how. this year, and ur the lot Wing
of Five was easily the best. His gen-
eritlshil) was good, and with a good
second sackcr few would steal on him.
Peterson or Three was a. iair catcher,
but he was a weak hitter. Munster of
Four might have been gncd if he had
caught a tame pitcher, and is given
honorable mention because he was the
best man on his team.

Test was the outstanding man on the
Laugan teaiIL He would probably be
best in the outiield, and if he had hit
better would have been placed at
right field before Moran. He played
in the infield and pitched the Langen-
ites to two victories over the tail end
teams in addition to hitting ,357.
Therefore he completes the team as
utility man as he could fill in at either
an infield or outfield position to ad-
vantage.
