Scarlet and Black

Latin American Silhouettes

by Jill Neuman and Todd Francis

When we met our Costa Rica
iamilies, we had the iirst oi many
awkward experiences involving
new customs. Here we were, try-
ing to sort out faces and names, be
ing kissed irom every direction.
We soon discovered that whenever
you meet a iamily member or
friend, kissing is the most common
greeting. Even between new ac-
quaintances a kiss is oiten ex-
pected. Kissing reilects the
general closeness that we round
present in family life in Costa
Rica.

The iirst thing we noticed when
we arrived at our new homes was
the iron bars that hid the houses.
Getting in involved going through a
high outer ience, past barred win-
dows, and through another locked
door. Except ior the very poor
shacks that lie on the outskirts of
the neighborhoods, every house is
fortified.

Within the bars, houses are
typically small and are surrounded
by tiny yards or patios, ii anything
at all. inside the houses. many peo-
ple will oiten share a iew rooms,
Sharing bedrooms and even beds is
common; loggia singles would be
coveted here.

Despite small living quarters,
however, houses are kept very
tidy, unlike college dorm rooms.
The cleanliness generally results

irom a lack or many material
possessions, and the pride and value
placed on what is owned. Floors
and walls are generally without
decoration, except for religious
symbols such as portraits of Jesus
and the Virgin Mary.

One staple possession in Costa
Rica, however, is the television
set. Shows like “Dynasty," dubbed
in Spanish. provide a major locus
for family activities all day and
evening,

Before we came to Costa Rica,
we had heard about the machismo
that exists in Latin America, but
we began to understand first-hand
more of the different roles that
men and women have here. Men
have much more freedom in ac-
tivities outside the home. For in»
stance, it is common for groups of
young men to travel to various
parts oi the country, but young
women tend to stay at home.

Your Precious
Negatives Never
Leave Our Store!

by Todd Francis

The 4:30 am. wakerup time we
had been warned about was, unfor-
tunately, accurate, so we dragged
our tired bodies onto the road with
the caravan, It was my turn to ride
in the back or the pickup where our
backpacks were, so i settled down
under the stillrdark sky and fell
asleep.

1 awoke at a small roadside stop
where we had scrambled eggs mix-
ed with rice, beans, and tomatoes.
After the meal I wandered back to
the pickup and lay down among the
packs.

A man comes by and asks me ior
a ride. 1 shrug and stumble over a
few words, not knowing what to
say since it s not my truck, and i
dont want to jeopardize our ride
He finally gets out Of me who the
driver is and goes to inquire.

He returns and joins me, cramp»
ing the space a bit. He’s dressed
nicely, as most Mexicans we’ve
met are. Collared shirt, slacks,
casualrdl-ess shoes. He carries only
a small white plastic bag. The
driver gets in the pickup, and
we're traveling east.

Above the noise of the wind I find
out the new hitchhiker is from
Mexico City. He used to make fur-
niture, but as oi a week ago, he was
sick of working hard all day, every
day, for two or three dollars. So he
just left.

He tells me his name is Genero.
He wants to know What life is like
in the United States. Earn lots of
money, right? And lots oi jobs. And
very pretty. And lots oi iun things
to do.

I begin to construct a vision oi
the United States as I’ve seen it on
television. Laughter, vacation, at-
nuence, Beautiiul people splashing
around crystal-clear rivers, Fancy
restaurants and new cars. Sket-
ches of wonderful lives that never
were.

Personals

I listen for a while. Then he stops
and looks at me. That‘s how it is.
isn’t it, he asks.

Well, i admit, you can iind most
of that stuff if you look for it. But
life isn't all like that. -

He looks encouraged by my iirst
statement. And you can make lots
or money, right? As much in an
hour as carpenters make in a day?

l nod. But everything costs lots
more Food especially.

I wonder why he‘s so interested
in life in the United States.

His eyes glitter as he tells me he
plans to go there. To live a better
life. He has to go to a town near the
Guatemalan border first, where
his brother lives. There he has
identification papers that he needs
to go north.

And how is he going to get to the
border?

He and a iriend will drive up and
go into the States together, Genera
tells me.

I turn back to the surroundings,
tired of the direction of the convers
sation. The green reaches irom the
edges oi the road up to treetops 100
ieet above, I could probably count
100 species between if I b id the
time.

How beautiful the countryside is
in southern Mexico, 1 say to him.
He smiles. Yes, Mexico is a pretty
country, he agrees. The prettiest in
the world.

We pass a house on one side, then
another. A minute later the streets
are lined with buildings.

Genero stands up and gets the
driver’s attention. The pickup
stops. Genera reaches out, shakes
my hand, grabs his bag.

I wish him “huena suerte."

He jumps oii the truck and onto
the road and disappears down the
road as we speed once more
toward Guatemala.
