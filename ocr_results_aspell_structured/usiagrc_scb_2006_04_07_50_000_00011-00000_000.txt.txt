Gary Kaltn ’09 stepped onto the ﬁeld with the rest
of thc Grinnell baseball team to face off against the
University of Iowa club team in the ﬁrst game for the
Pioneers this academic year.

The game started like hundreds ofothers the Pio~
neers have played in the past, but this time Liter: was
an important difference. It was October.

Although college baseball is a spring sport, the Pie
oneers got an extremely early start this year, going up
against the University oflowa's club team long before
the official beginning ofthe baseball season.

Kahn, like much ofhis teammates, missed class to
play in the frigid weather.

Despite the less-than-ideal playing conditions
and a small amount of conditioning, the baseball team
pulled together to put up a win. even with the regnilar
season far away

“Every single person stepped up to the plate,"said
Kahn.

Six months later. the fall serimmages and the
motivation of the Pioneers have finally paid off. The
baseball team has come out of spring break With a
record of5—4, the best start to a season in over three
years.

This success left carcaptain Peter Leo ’06 feeling
that the team as a whole had come together.

“Every game somebody new stepped up," he said.

The most surprising games of the series came
against Northwood University and Earlham College.
Both Northwuod and Earlham provide sports schol-
arships, which generally lead to teams with deeper
rosters than the teams at schools without sports
scholarships sueh as Griunell. -

The Pioneers split their doubleheader against
Earlham College, which has a nationally ranked baser
ball team. The Pioneers won the ﬁrst contest 4,1 and
dropped the second game 1—4. »

The victory was a big step for the Pioneers who
were considered the underdogs going into the games.

“Team effort won that game," said Pat Lyons '09.

The Northwood game was much closer than the
two games against Earlham. The Pioneers pulled
away with a 4-3 win against Northwood University.

A large number of the games over spring break
were hard fought and won by a narrow margin.

Kahn felt as if all the games could have gone ei-
ther way.

"Even though we came out of Florida 54, we
could easily have come out 8—1," he said.

This season’s strong start made an especially
important statement for the upperclassmen on the
team who are focused on keeping up the momentum
throughout the remainder ofthe semester and ending
theirlast season on a high note.

“Every year the younger players mice a signiﬁcant
contribution and this year is no different," said Leo.

The baseball team works together throughout the
year to create a team mentality. The team is also en-
couraged to spend time together outside of practice.

“We get to know each other so well off the ﬁeld
that it helps on the ﬁeld,"said Leo.

This emphasis on unity helps to welcome first
years to the team and include them in the camara-
derie.

"The freshmen are really quickly incorporated
into the team,”said Lyons.

Fall practices, run exclusively by team members
rather than coaches, help first»years get to know the
rest ofthe team.

"You’re getting introduced to everyone right off
the bat By the time the season starts you know
how people play,"said Lyons.

he team is reaping the rewards for these practice
sessions, and they have come back from spring brealt
feeling very confident about the rest of the season.

“We stepped on this campus as a team with the
utmost potential but with a reputation of not getting
it done," said Kahn, “but we gelled into a team and
our camaraderie is incredible."
