Comparative Smell Point to close
Contest Tonight—Both Teams
Perfect Combinations.

Gi‘innell is now rounding The last
lap of then home games. Tonight's
game with the Kansas Aggies, Friday
with Oklahoma and the next Friday s
contest Willi [he \Vashingtnn ﬁve will
complete the schedule of games to be
Played on the local colllt.

It is expected that the clllsh With
the Aggies tonight will be one of the
most interesting games of the season
on the Gl‘innell court. At present thE)’
stand seventh in the valley, having
won two games and last seven. Their
two victories have been over Gl'innell,
whom they defeated 23 to 13 early in
the season, and over Washington whom
they also defeated on the Lawrence
court. However in a return game
Washington won over the Aggies so
to 23 while Grinnell defcated Wash-
ington 23 to 22 at st. Louis. 0n the
Whole comparative scores would seem
(1) indicate that the decision is about
a draw.

Develop Smooth liLaehine

Since playing Grinnell the Aggies
have developed a new forward, Doh-

son, who seems to be doing some good'

work. They also have the veteran
Cowell at guard and Williams has
done well at the center position. Re-
ports have it that the Aggie machine
has been greatly improved lately, as
thei 25 to 24 game with Nebraska last
Week indicates.

Although Coach Saunders has made

no deﬁnite statement {ls to the mch

whom he will start in the game it is

expected that tonight will see Benz!

Stﬂl‘tin gat center, Crilcllet and Garner
at forwards and Macy and Smith at
guards. Critchet, who partially Sprain-
ed his \\ I t in the Kansas U. game,
has been back for the last few days
practice and will probably he used as
long as his injury dues not bother
him.

The Pioneers have spent most of tb‘c
time this Week in the playing of the
ball under the basket and trying to
remedy the defects in their [la DE
system which came to light in the
Ames game.

If the Pioneers play the brand of
basketball which they exhibited
against Kansas ll. they should be able
to get the long end of the score but
tactics like those used in the Alnes
game would leave the decision more in
doubt. At present there seems to be
no reason why they will not be going
at top speed when they meet the team
from Kansas tonight.

This game will mark the ﬁrst time
that a Kansas Aggie team has ever
played on the Grinnell floor.

Guarding Feature

The close guarding by both teams
proved to he the feature of the game,
as the low score will testify. Capt.
Macy and Ty Smith, Grinnell’s two
icrack guards, did all that could he
expected of them in holding down the
scoring of the fast Cyclone offense but
their team mates seemed unable to
garner enough counters to win the ﬁ—
nal decision. Benz, who is now sixth
man in the individual scoring colum of
the Missouri valley. dropped in nine
lof the eleven points scored by the
Pioneers, three being ﬁeld goals and
three more tosses from the foul line.
earner with a beautiful long shot to
his credit was the only other Grin
nellian who was able to locate the
i hoop.

Innes, the Iowa State center, was
the most outstanding all round p133“
er for the v itors, playing a good
galne both in the scoring department
‘ztntl in team Work. “Finliey” Green,
‘lthe dimunitive Cyclone forward, also
succeeded H] mulling his presence very
Jmneh felt throughout the game. He
,only managed to cage one long ringer
from mid floor but his fast passing
and dribbling was an important factor
in his team s offense

For some minutes after the upcnc

‘cd ' i'lom ollo end of the floor

the hoop. Woodward and runes lhen‘
counted from the ﬁeld and Currie con
trlhutcd a free throw. giving the vi.
tors a lead of ﬁve points over the
Grinnell quintet. Benz then made two
‘lollow shots good and the score hoard
read ﬁve all. Two free throws apiece
,by Benz and Currie and a goal by
lInnes completed the scoring for the
half. oil the whole this half was a
rather indifferent exhibition of what
good basketball should be. Both sides
resorted to an excess of dribbling
which efectually broke up any at
‘tempts at team work. The score at
half time was Amos 9 Grlnnell 7,

Ilnlly Killed

Benz opened the second half with
a short shot on a formation play
which seemed for the thne to be the
forerunner of a pioneer rally. The‘
Grinnell rally proved to be short lived
however and Currie soon evened the
score with two foul tosses. With the‘
score tied at nine all both teams hogan
a frantic endeavor to get the lead. 0w-
ling to the close guarding on both sides
the game soon resolved itself into a
long range bombardment, but at this
game the Pinneers seemed to have a
jinx dogging their heels, shot after
shot looping into the basket only to
hesitate on the rim and then bounce
out. For n time the Ames tossers also
were unable to locate theboop but
ﬁnally their luck changed and Wood—
ward. Green, and Currie counted from
well out in the iloor. This rally end—
ed the Iowa state scoring but the
lead was more than the Pioneers could
overcome in the remaining time. Gala

the Pioneer attempt at a. last minue‘
