VER the last weekend the

Monmouth and Knox.

throws proved to make the difference
in the final score, 57-49. Monmouth
made 15 of 33 free throw attempts
while Grinnell hit four of their eight
attempts.

Coach Kingsley did not blame
the referees for the foul discrepancy,
instead she attributed it to
Monmoulh's point guard who “cone
Sistently penetrated and kicked."

Grinnell's shooting percentage
also lead to their demise, as the Pio~
nears hit 21 of 76 from the field for
28%.

Individuals who provided bright
spots for were Sara Schoen, Dacey
Waldron,LnraCzaJkowski,andSa|ly
