.A Tradition Reappears

We are ill the midst of transition. Whether
we like it or not, traditions disappear and
new traditions are erected; institutions de-

cay and new institutions establish them—
selves. This year Grillnell is seeing more
changes than usual, with the promise of
still futhel' alterations ill store. But there
are some traditions which no one wants to
see er dicated. Among tlleni is the annual
performance of Handel’s “Messiah.”

Nevertheless, things change. Since 1924,
he Vesper Choir has sling the Oratorio; this
year it has been augmented into a chorus
of two hundred voices. Yet this apparent
break with tradition is in reality a return
to one of even longer standing- The innova-
tion ol‘ the Grillnell Chorus harks back to
the Oratorio Society which was established
in Grilillell in 1901, and which attracted
national attention. The performance of the

essiah” is a leafl’il'nlatioll that Grillnell
has a history which it is not forgetting, and
which will continue to play an integral part
ill its present.

And the lliag‘nificanence of Handel’s music
will continue, despite upheaval ill the counr
try in its origin, to be one of the high-
lights of the Christmas season, Hearing it
is all experience which does not grow stale;
familiarity only increases the pleasure of
listening to it again. Gl'illnell is fortunate
in the tradition which makes that familiar-
ity possible.

To the Editor:

last year I had occasion to point
out in the Scarlet and Black how
unreliable is the present method
of ranking athletic teams merely
on the basis of games won and
lost. The real ability of a team
is measured more fairly by a comr
parison of offensive and defensive
play during the season, since
chance plays so large a. part in
the winning of games by close
scores. Last year the ranking of
the Midwest teams in basketball
was Changed materially by such
'8. comparison. This year the fool.‘

ball results throughout the coun-
try would be even more drastically
affected. Rarely has there been a
season when there were so many
close scores, with results due often
to more lucky accidents. In the
Big Nine (formerly Tell), Michi-
gall made a better record both of.
fensively and defensively than
Minnesota and had clearly the
stronger teal-n, though the myth-
lea] “championship” went the oth-
er way. in our conference, a result
which gave the decision to a team
making one first down, to thirteen
first downs for Crinncll. was more
than a bit absurd: and this one
game decided the “championship”
of the conference.

To the Editor:

This is a plea from the White
House committee to the student
body.

Since the bcgining of the school
year, the student body has been
very carclcss in its use of the
privileges of the white House.
Some students have shown very
little consideration for their fel-
lows. -

Here are only a few of the
things which must be corrected if
the White House is to continue:
coats scattered anywhere, cigar-
ettes and ashes on the ﬂoor, put-
ting feet on furniture, failure to
return “coke" bottles and dishes
to me counter, failure to use the
wustebdskcts, and misuse of the
card facilities.

Will you cooperate?

White House Committee

The good work done this year
by our coaches and the Grinnell
team is obscured by the present
ranking system. It becomes clear--
or when one realizes that Grinnell
made the best record in the con-
ference, hour offensively and dc-
fensively, for the entire season.
Tile third plaice rank on the bn s
solely of games wall is not in fair
measure of the work of the team.

A better measure would be pro-
vided if three criteria instead of
one were used to determine the
rank of the teams: first, games
won and lo: second, offensive

had the three ranks, and place the
teams in the order of these sums.
The result for the season, for the
first five teams, would run as
shown in the scccmpanying box.
I should prcfcr, personally, that
thc whole business of “champion-
ships" and the ranking of teams
were given up. However, if there
is no escape from such compari-
sons. let them be made on a less
fortuitous basis than the one now
used.

Adopts Plan

Harris Refutes idea
Calling for Enlarged
StuclemL Governing Body

Detailed proposals for the
third annual revision of the
Student Council constitution
were adopted late last night by
a special committee authorized by
the recently organized Constitu-
tlonal Convention.

Directed by the Convention to
submit a compromise plan. our
hcdylng the salient features of
the various proposals submitted
to the Convention last Saturday
the Committee outlined provisions
for increased representation upcn
the council.

Harris Disnpprovcs Plan.

Approving the plan wcrc com—
mittee members Jean Hcinsen.
Catherine Funk, Jack Truesdaie
and Ray Nelson. William 0. Hair-
ris, fifth member of the group. rc—
fuscd to endorse the program,
characterizing it as an unecessary
departure from the lessons of the
past experience. Robert C, Young,
president of the Student Council,
served as committee chairman
without the voting privilege.

outstanding feature of the new
plan is the proposal for a larger
Student Council composed of rep-
resentatives elected from the halls
and cottages and embodying a
Central Committee of seven mem—
bers elected in the manner pro»
vided for the present Student
Council. According to the new
plan, the Central Committee is
to 'be entrusted with the routine
and specialized duties of the Coun-
cil. while the larger body is to be
concerned with the broader as
pects of campus government.

Both groups are to work in
close cooperation, holding joint
meetings at least once a month.
At these meetings the larger body
will recommend courses of action
to the Central Committee.
