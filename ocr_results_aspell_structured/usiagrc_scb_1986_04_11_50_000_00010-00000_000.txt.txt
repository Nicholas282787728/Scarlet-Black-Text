nasketball, Collegiate basketball (and we

e?), and if that wasn‘t enough, profes-
ional basketball. Don't get me wrong; I
like basketball as much as the nextlguy
oes, but i do have my breaking point.

One would guess that after spending an
ntire winter in front of the TV watching

eferees making the calls that they do, it
cold be fairly easy to call the games
i ourself. In my opinion, that Wouldn't be a
ad idea; I'm sure we’ve all seen some

If you’re not into that, Grinnell does
have 5 beautiful, outdoor tennis courts,
available for student use, And believe it or
not, if you don’t have a tennis racket, you
can borrow one from the PEC cage upon
presentation of an ID. Amazing!!! Heck,
you may even be lucky enough to catch a
tennis match in action!

You say you can‘t play tennis because
you're uncoordinated7? But you don’t
want to become a couch potato? Well,
maybe it‘s time you thought of joining all
of the joggers across America and cats
ching the running craze. No one can be so
uncoordinated that they can’t run. if you
can walk, you can run. (1 myself have pro—

blems with walking which may explain

why I have tripped a few times while out
jogging! !)

The town of Grinnell, while small in size,
seems to have an endless number of roads
to jog on, You can go jogging out by farms,
into the downtown area, around campus,
or (this is a compromise for those who
don't like the outside) inside the PEC,
where one gets eight laps to the mile.

OK. You absolutely refuse to go outside.
(You're allergic to the sun perhaps?) Well,
once more the PEC comes to the rescue.
Besides having a track available for runn-
ing. one can use the olympic size swimmr
ing pool and afterwards, the saunas. if
you’re afraid you’ll drown or that there are
sharks in the pool, you can always go lift
weights, either in the free weight or
universal weight room.

For those who can't lift a feather, maybe
racquetball is your thing, Some advice:
the little round balls you hit around go ex-
tremely fast and hurt when they hit youtt
Believe me, I know!! And if any of the
above doesn’t suit your taste, well, you can

Softball eam
meets ox
at home

‘ by Paula Rue

Almough their co season record does not
show the amount of effort they are putting
in, the Women’s Softball team is now look-

, ing forward to being competitive with the

rest of the conference teams.

According to Co-Coach Jim Gilbert, the
team has been through the most difficult
portion of their season this year. Last
week, after the Pioneers put in a strong
performance against Marshalltown Comr
munity' College, they ran into two of the
Conference’s strongest teams, Cornell and
Coe. The Pioneers lost to Cornell on Sun-
day, 14-4 and 12-1, and on Tuesday, drops
ped two games to Coe, 15-0 and 23-i.

Said Gilbert, “As a team, we're going to
have to score a lot of runs to win. Defens
Sively, we are still a little inconSlstent, and
have to reduce the amount of errors per
game. offensively. we have to hit the ball
in order to generate some runs,” Gilbert
remarked that the team is not being
cautious. however, and is improving their
hitting and fielding during practices by
structuring practices as though they are
actual game situations.

Gllbert pralsed the pitching staff, con-
sisting of Neva Specht, Liz Schumacher.
and Pam Fricse, for doing an excellent
job, He commented that they are doing
very well. considering they have never pits
Ched at the collegiate level and are Just
learning how. in addition, the three also
have the strongest bats on the team right
now.

The team has also had strong perfors
mances from the starting infield. Sharing
playing time at first are Terri Porter and
Gini Frazer, while starting at second is
Diana Lewis Shortstops are Flora Winitz
and Pam Eriese. Jeri Matchinsky is play
ing third, and putting in solid efforts
behind the plate is Susan Peters.

The outfield is also looking stronger.
Right now Schumacher is also playing left
field. Kisa Hoover is in right field, and
M..i. Constant and Natalie Romero in
center field. Gilbert also hopes to see good
things from Peggy Doyle and Caryn
Erickson in the outfield and Jana Kramer
in the infield. _ .

Gilbert commented that “I have no
doubts that the team will get better as the
season progresses; the team hasn’t jelled
yet. We need to be a little more consistent,
but that will happen as the season con-
tinues.” The Pioneers next game is a
double-header this Saturday aganst con-
ference opponent Knox. Game time is 1
p.m. and will be played at Merrill Park,
right down Park Street past tilth Avenue.

of hits, Grinnell and Cornell split the
double-header, taking one game apiece.
Grinnell lost the first game 1775, but turned
the tables on Cornell in the second game,
slaughtering them 16-5. Tom Monogue was
