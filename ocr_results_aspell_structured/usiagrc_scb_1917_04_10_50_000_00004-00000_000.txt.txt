“PRINCESS I’AT” FLEASES

Comic 01mm Scores llit Before Unline-
ity House Despite Tllllll)‘ Conflict-
ing Attractions.

“The Pliucess Pat," which was prc-
seiitcil at the Colonial theater last
night, was the best comic opera that
GriuueII has seen this year In spite
oi the many other conflicting enter—
tainments of yesterday evening it was
presented before a capacity house.

The leading role or "Princess Pat"
was well taken by Miss Dorothy Smith,
but Miss Ethel Boyd playing the pait
of her chum was undoubtedly the far
critic of the audience.

Tile Dance Dii'civtisement given in
the third act by “Tony” and "Marie,"
even before a Grinnell audience, was
appreciated as being the Very best.
This act was the real climax or the
play and the male chorus, at the opcn~
ing of this act, was encored again and
again.
