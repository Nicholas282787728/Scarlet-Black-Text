In a recent issue of Colliers \Vceklr

Soccer looihiill, in order to enable
the readers ol the Scarlet and tllack'
to have a little better insight into the
merits of the game this article is i
printed in part:

Football, so the late .\lr. Webster
says, is "the game or kicking the bill!

and Association, or soccer, as it is
called. ‘

Association football was born and
bred in Great Britain, whether in ling
land, Scotland, lrelaud, oi- mayhao
Wales, is of little consequence, and
there it has thrived and waxed fat,
event as cricket, whereas here it has
starved and grown lean, even as Crickr
et. But the day of awakening has
come, in this country. Soccer, which
is, in fact, “football with the feet,"
has slowly, but none the less surely,
fought its way» to a forward place
among the athletic activities of the
land, The colleges, or at least some or
them, are maintaining teams, and
clubs are springing up lrom coast to

in spite of its amazing popularity
abroad, where so many as 125,000 per
sons have fought their way into seeing
dismnce of a big cnp match, its his
here has been one long struggle for ex-
istence. All this is now changed, ho
ever, and while the boom days are not
yet, it may he said in all fairness that
Soccer is growing.

For the beneﬁt of the uninitiated, it
may be said that soccer is played with
a round, leathercovered bail, on a
played ﬁeld marked by boundary
lines, with goals set up at each end.
The ohiect, of course, is to advance
the ball to within striking distuncr
oi the goal, and send it home with o
wellrdil'ected kick. Under severe pe -
alties provided hy stringent rules, the
custodian of the goal, or nets, is the
only one allowed to use his hands, and

As Orcllcttl-a ‘ttmbers.

The College Orchestra, directed by
Professor Pierce, gave a very good con-
cert at Herrick chapel Saturday night.
The attendance was not so large as it
has been at previous musical events
but, those present snowed themselves
fully appreciative oi the splendid mus
sicianship displayed in the various
llllmhc

For a college organization, tlic 0r-
chestra played with admirahlc pl‘eciss
ion, and produced artistic ellects that
are seldom realized outside of moles
sioiial orchestras The r suits or a
vriir's consistent practice were plainly
evident in the performance, which ran
ﬁat-led much credit upon the various
participants.

The selection of numbers is note-
worthy not only because of the excels
lciire of the music from a technical
standpoint, hilt also because of its ins
her-cut inedolious qualities which ren-
dercd it capable of being readily aphi-
ciatcd by the audience.

The orchestra nuinbcrs consisted oi
"Selections from Faust" by Gounod;
Haydll‘s “Symphony Na. 4"; Titl
"Serenade"; and a march, "Pump and
Circumstance," by Elgar.

Mr. Harvey rendered a pleasing
group of dute solos, which were well
received by the audience. The group
consisted of on “Idi'llo” by Von Suppc;
the andnntc from Mozart’s Concerto
No, 2; and Koeillel"s "Saltcrello."

The other soloist, Mr. Heizer, execiIL-
ed threee violin solos with a dash and
abandon, which combined with much
real technical ability, caught the fancy
of the audience and called forth vigor-
ous applause. The "Largo" by Handel
was especially well played.

Coppess who later scored on errors
making the total two for that inning.

half or the third, getting ﬁve runs on
two hits and tno errors. No scoiing
was done until the ﬁfth, when Cornell
got two. The ﬁrst man up was put
out. the second man \lalked aiid got to
scoop don what the umpire called a
balk by Ficlien. This gave Cornell
two rims. The next man responded
with a three-bagger and was sacriﬁced
home on u long fly to left. From now
on until the eighth no scoring was
done.

in Cornell's hall of the eighth the
ﬁrst man up got life by an error and
scored on a threerbase hit by Soppess
who scored himself when Carney's
wild throw home vient high and wide.

The ﬁrst half of the ninth opened up
with the score 5 to 7 in favor of Cor-
nell. Carney, the first man up, was
thrown cut short stop to ﬁrst. Klein
then responded to it hit and reached
third on hlyskien's liit. Loos. the his
catcher, up next, also succeeded in
placing a hit just over short stop
which scored Klein yet not far enough
out to score llyskeens. oh the ﬁrst

left two men on bases and one out.

pitcher, and substituted Coppess, who

The meet was favored by fairly
propitious weather and was a pretty one
to watch. The ﬁnish in the wowed-d
dash was one of the closest ever seen
in ui-innell, Turner, H. Marshall and
Gill ﬁnishing only inches apart. The
lanyard dash was another pretty race,
Marshall winning from a fast ﬁeld in

The contest of the afternoon was be-

scored 31173 points, while the sopho-
mores were able to secure only 12. The
Academy broke into the limelight with
six points, ﬁve of them due to Tooley'o
pretty win in the low hurdles.
