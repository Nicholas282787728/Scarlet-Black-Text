Most Dangerous Man
in Europe—Hitler

Hitle of Germany and Dolfuss.
“Austri s pocket-Hitler.n were de-
clared to he the most dangerous men
in Europe today. by Sherwood Eddy.
author and lecturer. in an address on
“Danger Spots in Europe." in Her—
rick chapel this morning.

Although professing sympathy for
Germany. Dr. Eddy denounced the
violence and race-prejudice of Hit»
lei-ism. and pointed to Germany as
one of the possible sources of war in
Europe. "Whatever good Hitler has
doneiand he has done much—he is
the most dangerous man in the world
today."

Austria was also listed as a dam»
.gerous zone. where "anything might
happen” under the leadership of Dol-
fuss, "who is trying to imitate Hit-
ler."

Russia. the third danger zone. is
at present “a reagent in the interna~
tional laboratory.’ Dr. Eddy said.
Denouncing the violence, dogmatic
atheism, and denial of political liber-
ty in the old Russian system. he nev-
ertheless praised the Soviet republic
as a great experiment in social jus-
tice. and predicted the coming of 50s
cinl justice to be inevitable.

Brands Americanism
Unsuccessful

Fascism is based upon the assump—
tion that the common people possess
neither the intelligence nor the ahil—
ity to govern themselves. explained
Alden G. Alley. representative of the
National Council for the prevention
of War. in his address Friday eve
sing on “Fascism and Americanism."
”There appears to he a great deal
of truth in this assumption," the
speaker confessed. asserting that
Americanism. hased upon the theory
that people are capable of govensing
themselves. had proved unsuccessful.
Control hy a small group of men
possessing hroad vision. installed by
parliamentary means. if possihle. hut
otherwise by force. was designated
as the basic principle of Fascism.
Mr. Alley declared that the failure
of democracy has been responsible
for the rise or Fascism but he ques-
tioned whether it had accomplished
all that had been expected of it. “In
general." the speaker declared, ”the
Fascisti leaders have railed to do
better than the democratic adminis-
trations which preceded them."

Capitalism Not Failure,
Nathan Asserts

The roost significant problem that
must be faced by all the countries is
what to do to avoid the next depres-
sion. declared Dr. Otto Nathan. for-
mer economic adviser to the German

Reich. in his address on "World Ecce
iiomic Recovery” last night in Her-
rick chapel.

Dr. Nathan was formerly connect»
ed with a bank in London and Brus-
scls. and on the eve of the political
change in Germany. left for this
country. While he professed to be
neither for nor against capitalism.
he based his statements on the fact
that capitalism has not failed or
broken down.

In Dr. Nathan‘s judgment.
can he done to entirely avoid depres—
sion. “Booms and depressions are in~
evitahle in our economic system."

Dr. Nathan clahorated on the {01-
lowing four problems that are tied up
with recovery: (1) the monetary queS»
tion; (2) government interference in
starting the recovery; (3) whether
capitalism. socialism, or another
form or government should be domis
nant; (a) whether the world recovery
should he based on nationalism or in~ 1
ternationnlism.

War Not Imminent,
Declares Buell .

“war need not be feared for the
immediate future." declared Raymond
Leslie BueII. president of the Foreign
Policy association. in his address Fri-
day on “The World Adrift."

The speaker cited tour specific
characteristics of the present day
world which have played a big part
in recent international developments.
These were. the collapse o: the instie
tution of capitalism; the collapse ofg
democracy and parliamentary institusi
tions; collapse of the peace ma-
chinery of the world; and the fear of
a new war. which dominates the
world.

The existing spirit of peace which
predominates in most of the nations
of the world and the present equilib-
rium of political forces .gteatly min-
imize the probability of immediate
war. Mr. BueIl asserted. He gave as
a third basis of this belief, the fact
that Germany. the most likely source
of the next world conflict, will he
unprepared to make war for some
years to come.

In concluding his address. the
speaker named four requisites to
solving the existing international un-
rest. Economic differences between
nations must give way to interna-
tional cooperation. he asserted. The
other requirements included the re-
examination of political agreements
