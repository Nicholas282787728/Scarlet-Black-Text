OCTOBER l6, I942

 

By Scoil‘ Mills

Gates Hall sprang an intramural
football upset Tuesday, nosing
out Clark 1513, when a slow
first half turned into the season's
most thrilling game in the sec-
ond half.

Clark broke the ice when Lenny
Weller intercepted a flat pass
and trotted nonchalantly over the
line to score.

A few minutes later Hart of
Gates unleashed a mighty sixty
yard pass which fell into Batons
arms for a touchdown. , Gates
failed to convert, out on the play
after the kickoff, Krause of
Clark was caught behind his own
goal to give Gates an 8-7 lead.
Soon Hart passed to Eaton for
another touchdown.

After the Gates conversion,

Clark scored the final touchdown
in a play which the ball went
from Krause to Brody to Seidlitz.

Beahaw

 

New Lineup Meets

ks Tonight!

 

Plagued by injuries, Coach
Ben Douglas’ Pioneers Will
charge into the Iowa City
Pre-Flight Beahawks Friday
night with a new lineup 111
both the backfield and the
line. following a week spent
in trying to strengthen line
play, both defensive and ofr

fensive.
“We got beat in the line at

Knox," said Douglas "Right in
the middle of the line."

Most important switch moves
Harry Waters, fast Marshalltown
end, from that position to the
backfield where he replaces Jack
McGrane, injured on the first two
plays in the Knox game last week.
McGrane will be out for at least
another week, suffering from a
tongue cut which took foul'estitche
es to close and a pulled shoulder
muscle,

Loss of McGrane, both a passer
and a runner, is a severe blow to
the team, but Douglas terms Wat—
ers, “One of the hardest runners
we have now and he should make
a pretty good back,"

Bowers at Center

Douglas has chosen Edd Bow-
ers to fill Ari. Woodward's place,
should the hard and longlasting
center have to be replaced. An
early season injury removed
Chuck Hultgren, sophomore re-
rerve center, from the squad, and
with no substitute, Woodward
played throughout the season's
first two games, and throughout
almost all of last week’s disap-
pointing battle with Knox.

Douglas. with several reserve
backs and no center substitute,
admits the combination is one
usual. “It's an awfully poor com-
bination, but 11‘: all we can do,"
he says.

Bob Corﬂgan was slated for
the and spot vacated by waters,
but he suffered a pulled should»
er muscle during practice this
week, moving Brlnle Vunstrum,
a sophomore into the starting
lineup.

Sophomore Vanstrum played
on the freshman team last year,

but has seen little service so far
this season because he fractured
a little finger during the second
week of school,
Balfbaok Undecided

Benny is still undecided about
the second halfback position, with
Augie Gruening, Phil Southworth
and Bob Barrett awaiting the
nod; however, he plans to start
Al Nichols, second string quarter-
back, at the signal calling spot.

With Art Werlein, Pioneer cen-
ter last season, leading the Beat—
nawks from his old spot in the
line, Douglas has no illusions
about the Navy school's ability.
“I expect they'll be pretty tough,"
he says, wondering about the
possibility of further injuries, and
with the homecoming fray with
Cornell coming up the following
week.

Townman Holds Record On
College ‘Obsi’acle Course

A new type of workout has been
added to the conditioning class
program this year, John C.’l‘uBSr
dale, physical education head, said
yesterday.

At least once a week the con»
ditioning classes run, jump, crawl,
and climb until they have covered
Grlunell’s new obstacle course. so
for Frank Molesberry, Town
freshman, has the best time for
the 528 yard course, having com-
pleted it in two minutes and
thirteen seconds.

Frisbie, strong, and Gee have
all done the course in under two
and a half minutes. Most stu»
dent reactions are favorable to
running the course because of the
variety of activity. he said.

James Noses Oui Meals;
Wins Hockey Championship

James Cottage won a close vic-
tory over Mears Cottage to
clinch the championship in field
hockey, Thursday. The final
score was 2-1 for the James girls.

with the score tied l»1 in the
final minutes of play, the James
girls crashed through the line to
make the winning goal.

Team Picked

Race Iowa Siaie This
Afiernoon In Firsi
Meef of I942 Season

Cross-country running was sched-
uled to make its first appearance
of the season here today With
the pioneer team opening against
Iowa state at 4:30 p. in.

An intro-squad meet was held
last week by Coach John Scott
Everton to decide which runners
to pit against Iowa state. Run-
ning a regulation race, David
Matlack came in first, followed
by Ted staniford, Koert Voorr
hees, Jack Mankey and Bill
smith.

The team consists of these
men with the exception of Bill
Smith, a freshman ineligible for
varsity competition, Biirtis Matth-
ews constitutes to fifth man on
the varsity team, Evel‘ton said.

The coach also stated that he
would enter a team of freshmen
in the race today merely for the
experience, since their perfor-
mance would not affect the
standings.

The cross-country team is
scheduled to see more action next
week, competing against the Cox‘—
nell and the Iowa City Pre-
Flight teams during the half of
the homecoming game.

aornell Leads Midwes+ Conference
As Grinnell Sulks In Cellar Wll‘h Coe

While Grinnell, on the bottom of
the conference heap, and playing
a nanrconfercnce game with the
Bealiawks from Iowa City's Naval
Pre-Flight school this week, has
little chance of bettering itself.
three Midwest conference games
may go a long way toward decid-
ing the championship this week-
end.

Cornell. league leader with two
victories and no losses. will meet
a light and crippled coe team
down two losses so far this
season, for what will probably
be its most successful homecome
ing in several years.

At the same time Monmouth
and Lawrence. both undefeated.
will meet at Lawrence, where de~
feat will mean a virtual eliminae
tion for chances at a clear title
by the loser, This is especially
true of Lawrence which plays but
five conference games,

lBeloit moves up to Ripon for
a Lossdlp game, with each team
capable of running up a score.
Last week Beloit held Cornell to
one touchdown and were driving
toward one themselves when the

contest ended.

And Teddy Scalissi let go a
couple to times against Coe to
pace Ripon to a 2070 win, while
Grinnell went down before Knox,
13—7.

After this week all teams will
be meeting conference opponents
with the exception of two games
at the close of the league season.

Teri Men Reporied For
Too Many Condifioning Cuis

Ten men have been reported to
the registrar for excessive ab-
sence from conditioning class,
John C. Truesdalc said yesterday,
but they are not being class‘ed as
delinquent. He said he expected
that most of these men would
have legitimate excuses.
