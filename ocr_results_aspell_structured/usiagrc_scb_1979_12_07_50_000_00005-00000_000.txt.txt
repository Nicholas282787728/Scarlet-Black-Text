NEH share to be used for books

The National Endowment for the
Humanities has named Grinnell Col-
lege as one of 100 institutions that will
share 527 million in challenge grants
for improvement of the nation’s
Cultural and educational resources.

NEH Chairman Joseph D. Duffey
said the grants ”will provide an imﬂ
portant financial stimulus to colleges,
museums, and libraries which are be
ing hit hard by rising costs."

Grinnell will receive $481,850 and,
under the challengegrant provisions,
will raise an additional $15 million
from non-federal sources.

The total of almost $2 million will be

used for library renovation, an endow-
ed humanities professorship, and
library acquisitions in me human' 'es.

Grinnell President George A. D'rake
said that expansion of library space
and substantially increased book ac-
quisitions are two of/the college s
highest priorities.

Projected renovation of the main
library will expand storage capacity
from the current 242,000 volumes to
almost dﬁuble that number.

Drake noted that money [or book ac-
quisitions currently comes out of the
annual operating budget, and “this
means that there are necessary con»

strainls on the amount that can be
allocated for such purchases, par
ticularly in View of the greatly in-
creased costs resulting from infla»
tion.”

Drake said that the new funds will
provide an endowment of some
$600,000, the income from which would
“significantly supplement the hook
purchases made out of operating
funds,”

Other endowed funds will he used to
recruit “an outstanding teacher»
scholar in the humanities as an addi-
tion to an already excellent faculty,"
Drake said.

Health Center ills a pain for students

by Bob Kleine

Despite accusations of inadequacy,
the Health Center received over 5000
office visits last year. The hostile feel—
ings towards the center may diminish
next Semester, as the office of Student
Affairs will implement a major policy
change beginning immediately after
winter break.

The Health Center is open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, while classes
are in session. However, nurses are on
duty only from 8:00 am. to 8:00 pm.
Monday through Friday, and 10:00
am. to 3:00 pm. on Saturdays.

Dr. Paulson, a local physician, acts
as the medical advisor for the Health
Center. Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman stated, ”Dr. Paulson
receives a very minimal amount of
money for the work he does as liaison
between the center and the town docs
tors."

The center currently employs two
registered nurses who alternate shifts
to provide the lar e number of hours
that they are avai able to the students.
Nelve students are also employed to
man the center when a nurse isn't on
duty.

These students usually have no pre-
vious medical experience because, as
Irma Hall, the administative superr
visor of the Health Center stated, “It
the students think they are
knowledgeable about a situation, that
can be dangerous, since most things
are more complicated than they
seem.” The students can receive
phone calls, supervise overnight
guests, and coordinate communica-
tions with the hospital, They may not
diagnose or give out aspirin or
painkillers.

The role of the nurses is a bit more
diversified. They may issue aspirin or
a pain reliever if the patient's condi-
tion warrants such action. The nurses
may also refer the patient to a local
doctor, dentist, or psychologist. Other
services provided include: diet
assistance, overnight stays for valid
reasons, and pregnancy testing.

In addition to these services, the
Health Center has supplied all the
ecembel 7, W/Q

resident advisers with a basic first aid
kit. These kits are designed to serve
as an alternative source or bandages
and other minor firstraid items as
these supplies are not otherwise
available unless the nurses are on du-
ty.

If a student informs the Health
Center of his illness, the center in-
forms the appropriate professors, and
can notify food service to prepare a
sack lunch if the student desira.

If the nurses feel that the student
may benefit from psychological help,
referrals may be made to a counselor.
Hall stated,“We are very fortunate to
have many excellent counselors on
campus." Sometimes students are
referred t the Poweshiek County
Mental Health Center, where a Grins

nell student is allowed live free visits.
The Health Center also provldes

some special services, Items such as
backpads, crutches, canes, and ban
dages may be borrowed, Special
dietary considerations are also made
with the assistance of Dave McCon-
nell.

However. most students feel the
Health Center is quite inadequate.
Some complain that no doctor is readi-
ly available on campus. Hall usually
answers, “One doctor could not satisfy
the diverse tastes of this campus and
besides, our budget simply will not
allow it,”

The biggest complaint heard is
about the rules regarding overnight
stays. One student complained, “You
can only stay at the Health Center if
you're not sick.”

The Committee on Student Life
recognized this weakness, and propos-
ed that the Health Center allow mildly
ill students to stay overnight.
Previously, overnight stays were
authorized only if a healthy student
desired to spend time alone studying,
or [or some other reason,

Apparently the administration felt
the proposal was feasible. because
next semester a student may stay
overnight when he is mildly ill. What
constitutes “mildly ill" will be deter
mined by the nurses; early references

oanv ,aof Aq oloqd

Head nurse Irma Hail

seem to indicate that recovery from
mono or infiuenze MAY qualify as a
“mild illness."

Additionally, the Emma Goldman
Clinic may come to campus next
semester, if the proper arrangements
can be made.

Besides CSL, students also have in
put into Health Center issues through
the Health Service Committee,
Associate Dean of Students Janet
Carl, 3 member of the committee,
stated, “We hope to sponsor some
workshops, distribute pamphlets about
the Health Center, and publish a
newsletter about the health services
offered on campus."

The Grinnell College Health Center
does compare favorably with other
schools of comparable size in Iowa.

At Coe College in Cedar Rapids, one
registered nurse oversees the service
Coe is fortunate in having a hospital
across the street; thus, all students
are referred there for aid other than
minor injuries.

Cornell College has its own doctor
on campus. However, he is from near-
by Cedar Rapids and has office hours
only two hours daily. 5
