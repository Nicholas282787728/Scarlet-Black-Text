While associate professor of political
selence Ira Strauber would have the cam-
pus believe that he will be hiding in Grin-
nell writing during his leave next year. he
will actually be helping Michael Jackson
with a new video. He will be a backup
dancer but “will make a very significant
statement concerning the relation oi
humankind to nature."

When asked to comment. Strauher threw
a violent [it and screamed “Get away from
me, you bozos. ‘

After the Charlatan Hack inlormed
President Drake ol Strauber’s plans,
Drake explained, “We‘ll have to do a com-
plete investigation to determine if such a
use of an academic leave will do Serious
harm to the school's'image You know we
did just spend a big wad or cash to get a
slicker image. and I don't want anything to
harm our investments."

Bob Grey, ch' r oi" the political selence
department, sa' . “Ya never know what

wttahotmte
new mam“ M

01' Ira will do. lguess it's his time, but it he
wants to get that iull professorship, I’d
suggest he reconsider something more
practical,

Speaking on the condition that her name
not be used, Susan Strauber said that Ira
"plans on having the lime ol his life," and
that “all of his life, he has secretly dream-
ed of escaping the ‘drudgery oi academia'
and making his mark on society,"

Rumor has it that Strauber has secured
a minor role Ior his daughter. Allison tas
the sweet young child who gets eaten by
the Evil Sludge Monster)L who will also be
trying out ior the Yankees while she is in
New York According to Allison, “I think
Don Mattingly is washed up and I’m going
to make sure that the Yanks don't blow
their chances oi going all the way "

The Video is tentatively planned to be
released in May of 1988. Copies will be
available through Public Relatio it the
lilm is “up to our fine standards."

Mayer lakes Fifth

by Jon Smith

Conspicuously absent from all of the
uproar concerning the Relays-gate aiiair
has been the founding father of Relays.
Mr. H. Wayne Moyer. Although the iacts
still remain somewhat in doubt at this
point. the Charlzitaii Hack has learned that
Mayer did indeed know about the covert
committee. In an interVicw with a source
close to the Relays Committee. a person
it ho has chosen to remain anonymous has
stated that Moyer did not only know oi the
rogue group. but he may have in tact been
the first to mention the creation oi such an
outfit.

Our source has also stated. however,
that although Moyer may have talked
about creating a covert group, he most
likcly (lid not realize that su ha group had
been formed or that their tivities were
so wide in scope. According to our source,
"Moyer was most likely afflicted with the
disease that is contracted by all great
leaders 7 that is. he probably iorgot be
authorized the group or he simply may not
be able to remember domg it. Can you
remember what you did on July Eourth or
last year?”

Most likely, a disappointed Jonathan
Smith. CosChair of the Relays Committee,
termed the rogue group with only tacit ap~
proval irom Moyer, Committee members
Monica Selter and Kate Chang have told
the Charlatan l-Iack that they had nothing
to do with the rogue group and are shocked
by the actions and activities of the group.
Relays Committee member Becky Bjork
could not comment because oi laryngitis.
