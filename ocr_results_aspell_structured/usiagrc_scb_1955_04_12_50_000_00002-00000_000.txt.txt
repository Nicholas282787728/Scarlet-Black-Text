Welcome

F1om faculty, administ1a-
tion and tlustee leactions to
Houaid Rothmann Bowen it
would seem that Grinnell
College has done itself proud
in its choice of the seventh
president, .

From the comments in this
issue by people who have
met Dr. Bowen it appears
that he is a man devoted to
21 truly liberal education, and

yet a man well versed in

'ncss administlation. Even
mole impoitant than this
difficult to achieve balance,
he is 11 man with the cour-
age of his convictions. We
know too that as a professor
at Williams college he Series
as a faculty counselor, and so
must be intimately acquanitr
ed with the problems, in-
terests, and desires ‘of stu—
dents. We extend a hearty
welcome to him.

Thank You, Mr.’ Weitz

The Scarlet and Black
Would likc.to say a special
“thanks" to Rudolph \l'eitz,

president of the Board of
Trustees 'of the college for
his wonderful cooperation

and valiant attempt to give
the students the news of the
appointment of the new pres-
ident as speedily as possible.

the Scarlet and Black, Mr.
Weitz said, “Students and
faculty members may be
sure that when a conclusion
is reached every effort will
be made to assure that an
announcement will he made
on the campus before it is
released to the public press."

On March 23 the editor of
the Scarlet and Black re4
ceived a letter from Mr,
Weitz promising that the
announcement of the new
president would be given to
the Scarlet and Black at 11
am. on a Friday, in time for
the afternoon press 'run, and
asked if this would suit the
needs of the paper. In this
way, he pointed out, the
Scarlet and Block would
scoop the metropolitian pa—
pcrs.

The editor’s response re
quested an earlier Friday re,
lease time if possible, and
the date of the announce
ment.

Mr. \Veitz replied on
March 28 by letter that the
announcement, would be made
on April 8, and said he
would be glad to release it
a few hours earlier to the
Scarlet and Black.

The editor wrote back and
reminded Mr, \Veitz that the
announcement would be
made during Spring vacation
when the students were ah-
sent from campus and said
that she felt this was e10
trcmely unfortunate.

Mr. Weitz called the editor
long distance during spring
vacation and expressed his

911101

regret and disappointment
that such 11215 the case, He
said that he made every ef-
fort that the news would be
given to the students first
through the Scarlet and
Black. and the editor certain-
ly vouches that this is true
He stated that nothing could
be done however' since the
Associated Press, the United
Press, and the Des Moines
Register and Tribune were
counting on the April 8 re-
lease, and trustees were com-
in;r to the campus from all
over the country on that
date

Ml: \Veitz's genuine and
diligent interest in keeping
the students informed and
informed first is certainly to
be commended as the best
kind of studellt—administ1~a~
tive relationship. We of the
Scarlet and Black are grate-
ful to him for his coopera-
tion and join him ill his
apology to the student body
that the announcement was
made during spring vacation
In an effort to compensate
for this a nucleus staff’of
foul" worked late last night
to bring you today every—
thing anyone on the Grin~
nell campus knows about
Howard Bowen, the new
president of the college, and
to bring you a message from
him which he wired to the
83:13 early this morning.
