If on are planning a trip to Eur-

reel: in Grinnell first .

Al Dichl, still looking [or candi-
dates for his riding academy, went
to the Pioneer Prudities fully equipe
[led with binoculars. Ever an eye for
business.

So it's the curve system that keeps
Ted Hewitt from getting a better
grade in psychology.

"1 law down and go splash," says
Cliff Ingram these days.

The medal for realism in the
Pl‘lldi goes to Althea Richardson
and Ford Stewart. Yes, in that they
were first.

in case there's still any doubt
about it, Madeleine did kiss Jimmy
Davis in the last scene of the Prud-
ities. No, this will not be a. complete
surprise to Bob.

We have often wondered how cel»
into people rate to be in the quad
after hours and how tlley get the
side door or hiears so easily. it
certainly is lucky that the lights
were out wasn't it?

This little city, the “London of
town" will guarantee to furnish you
with fogs equal or superior to any
you wll meet in Tratalgar Square
and enable you to concentrate on
the real points or interest. If we
wanted to we might also make a re-
marl-i about getting used to the Cock
(n) ey population.

Let nowr foregather and offer a
word of prayer for Bob Delong. Just
why. We don’t know, but it seems he
has entered a request so let us co-
operate. Thank you.
