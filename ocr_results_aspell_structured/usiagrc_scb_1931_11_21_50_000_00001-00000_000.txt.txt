‘Grinnell Fails to Threaten I

Bullpup Goal Line
at Any Time

(Spccl'al la The Scarlet and black)

DES MOINEsishowing an offense
which kept the ball in the mud of
Pioneer territory almost continually,
Drake university freshmen slipped
through slime of Drake stadium to a
7 to 0 victory over the GTiDDell fresh»
men here Friday afternoon. It was
the fourth straight victory for the
Bullpups.

The game opened with neither
team showing much advantage until
late in the first quarter when Potts
circled right end for 30 yards to
shave the leather to Grinnell’s 20-
yard. mark. Gaer Crashed into a
fighting Glinncll line for three yards
and Eells then skirted the other wing
to the three-yard stripe. Gaer plung—
ed over the line and then battered
through the Grimell defense for the

extra point.
Drake Threatens

Grinnell's offensive failed to click
in the second quarter and the Des
Moines aggregation inaugurated an-
other drive but was stopped short at
the 254}!de ribbon. In the third can.
to, a short punt of the waterlogged
pigskin gave the Bullpups another
chance on the Pioneer aﬂryard stripe.

The local outfit. led by Gacr and
Potts, plunged to the fourvyard line,
With fourth down and goal to go,
the Bullpups tried a,desperate triple
pass play which Potts carried uutside
on the one-yard mark.

Early Handicap Holds

Drake continued to threaten right
up to the final gun but the little Pio-
ncers stopped the next drive 20 yards
short of the final line. McDowell
snagged a Grinnell fumble on the 13-
yard stripe but a penalty for clipping
stopped that Drake try at the goal,

Grinnell yesrlings, after getting
back into their own territory early in
the game, were unable to overcome
the handicap, and fought a defensive
battle through the mud most of the
game. The muddy ball caused coin
tinual fumbling and prevented any
sustained drive. Passing was impos-
sible and the wet ball made it im-
possible for Grinnell's kickers to
punt out of danger,

Finl Star of Offense

Gaer’s battering tactics made him
the individual star of the game, while
Bells and Ragan also showed with
Drake's best. Pini was Griunell's on-
ly offensive threat in the backfield,
the little quarterback fighting his
way through mud and linemen for
gains when he carried the oval. Mc-
Millan and Sutton were Grinnell linc
stars.

Lecturer Favors
Complete Control
in Machine Age

“If We're going to have a mechan-
ized civilization, we must control it.
We can never do that, however, with—
out vigorous thought and a discon—
tinuance of living by slogan stim-
\llus,” said Stuart Chase, economist,
author, andlecturer, in an address in
Herrick chapel Thursday night on
“The End of an Eopch.”

“My experience as a public ac—
countant leads me to consider the
enormous extension of mental and
physical power from the human
point of vicw of assets and liabilities.
But the liabilities for this machine
age overshadow the assets to such a
degree that immediate thought and

‘action are necessary to save civiliza-

tion from the power it has Created,”
Watt started Age

Mr. Chase said in the beginning
of his speech that all machine power
started when James Watt, on a walk
in Glasgow, smiled the smile that
meant the birth of knowledge of
steam power that led to the indus-
trial revolution.

The assets of this modern machine
age, the speaker listed as: higher
living standards, shorter working
hours, less brute work, less supersti~
tion and growth of knowledge, de-
cline of physical cruelty, less hatred
of the alien, better physical health
generally, and the falling birthrate.

Robot Liability

Liabilities of this age Mr. Chase
ranked as: mechanical warfare, man-
kind is living on its economic capital.
absence of preservation of natural
resources, the robot in industry, and

DES MOINEsiBelievlng that the
stalwart Drake line would be able to
take care of Grinncll thrusts, Coach
Ossie Solem is concentrating his ef-
forts this week on methods of stop-
ping the vaunted Pioneer aerial at~
tack featuring "Hank" Thomas to
"Hank" Duncan.

Grinnell and Drake will meet Sat-
urday in the Bulldog homecoming af—
fair, It will be the thirty-eighth
tangle between the two institutions
and will also decide Drake's chances
for a fourth consecutive unbeaten
Missouri valley conference season.

To Rush Thomas

The Bulldogs have been character-
istically weak on pass defense this
year and the Drake mentor fears an
upset in the dope should the Pioneer
airworks click. He has constantly
lectured the firstrstting backfield
particularly in methods of breaking
up the Pioneer attack. Eldon Lind-
‘rtrom, Lloyd Lansrud, Wilton Brewer
and Ivan Seiberling make up this
quartet,

It is probable that Harold Mc-
Michael, Center. who has become a
star at the pivot berth after being
converted from a halfback position
three weeks ago, will he pulled out
of the line to aid in the knocking
down of Pioneer heavcs. The Drake
forwards, too, have been instructed
to rush Thomas whenever he gets
hold of the ball.

The Bulldogs will probably start
the same 11 men who performed so
well at Ames in the 7 to a defeat of
the Cyclones.

Thomas Available
for Drake Game

Despite prospects for a muddy
field for today‘s game with Drake
university at Des Moines, Coach L.
L. (Fuzz) Watt continued to stress
Grinnell’s aerial attack in practice
sessions throughout this week. With
Hank Thomas, his veteran ball car-
rier out of the lineup, the mentor
used James and McCrcary on the
tossing end of the passes.

If Thomas is used, and official
Word is that be will be available, al~
belt in a cast, be will Come from the
hospital, where he has spent part of
the week, to the gridiron. His back
injury did not prove as serious as
was at first feared.

Ulll-ich Out

Dick Ullrich, veteran Grinnell bdlfa
back. who broke a foot earlier in the
season, reported for practice early in
the week, but was requested to save
himself for the coming basketball
schedule rather than risk further in~
jury on the gridiron.

Coach Watt, for the first time this
year has left Thomas out of his
probable starting lineup, booking
Snap James, wily junior, for the sig-
nal calling post. McCreary, halfback,
who has not worked in the last two
games because of a knee injury, will
be among the starters at Drake, fill-
ing James' halfback post.

Last (in Schedule

Today's game is the last on the
Pioneer schedule but there IS a pos-
sibility of a post season contest for
charity, St. Ambrose of Davenport,
the class of Iowa conference elevens,
is trying to schedule Grinncll, while
