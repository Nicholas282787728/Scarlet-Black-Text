By ANDY HICKEN
Arts Columnist

1TH nary a word actu
ally uttered about the
issue. a lot was said

about multiculturalism in Harris
Center oil Friday.

Poncho Sanchez ’3 [min Jacz
Band rocked a large and enthusir
astic crowd with a very danceable
mix of AfrorCuban and related
music The build emphasized
dancingrorientedjazz,notthemorc
experimental, llSlcnlnganenlcd
strain that alienates many casual
music fans from the genre. The
songs were pretty evenly split be-
tweenLatlnrflcckcdjazzandjaZZr
ﬂcckcd salsa The crowd was rare
forGrlnnell in thatthcrcwcrcalot
ofpeoplethcrcwhocould actually
do real dances, like the mambo
and the rumba. The rest of usjust
stood there and gyrated, as usual.
It was great.

Highlights of the Show inr
cludedSanchcz'sown“Typhoon,"
which stalled as upbeatjazz, then
slipped into an amnztng rhythmic
sequence finally simulating the
“eye of the storm". it featured
West African percussion instru-
ments called shakerees, which are
basically wooden gourds sur
rounded by a meshes of beads.
One of the three percussionist:
began the segment by shaking Ihc
gourd to cause the beads to rattle
against it, then hitting the bottom
of the gourd to produce a deep
boom. Gradually, more were
added, until three were going at
once. Next, crowdr aided clapr
ping was added, creating an effect
like raindrops on the roof, Fi-
nally,therestofthebnndexploded
in, and the storm raged fullrborc,
carrying the awed crowd along.

Another highlight came to
Ward the end of the second sat.
when Poncho surrendered the cone
gas and showed his roots as a
vocalist in the R&B bands he
played in as a teenager in Southern
California. Helcd the bandthrough
a long medley of funk and R&B
covers. They made it work per
fectly, even though they had no
guitars ortrap se\.justa piano and
timbalcs. The Latinizatton only
servedtomakctheclassicsfresher-
sounding

Overall, the show was a pcr~
feet example ofthe diverse inﬂu-
ences that give American music
its vitality—African, Latin, Euro-
pean, etciinﬂucnccs that would
not have had any effect if those
cultures had chosen to remain iso~
latcd from each other.

LEVEN members of the

form pieces they choreo-

graphed as well as a piece by director
Marc Kotz at 8:00 pm. tonight and
tomorrow in Roberts Theater.

DancoTroummcmbersincludcﬁrst
years Alison Hart. Deborah Holbrookr
Spilmnn, Samli King and Claire Rambo;
sophomoressIicicenAli,HeatherDesaie
and Chelsea Smock; and juniors Lara
Ashelmaii and Joy Flshel.

Thiswoekend'srecitallslhefocusof
the work the Dance Troupe has done up
until now. Students have been working
togedtcr on the pieces since October.

Kotz said that he encouraged stir
dents to make choreogiaphillg a gradual
pioccss. and to work widtand change the

dances as they went. ”1 wanlt‘d them to
revrsc so that they oould look at the pro-
cess lather d-ian at the product," he said.

The student choreographers came
up with their own ideas and selected thier
own music. Tne dancers come from
different backgrounds and the concert
therefore contains lots of stylistic variety,
according to Kotz. Student pieces showa
wide range ofinﬂuence, includingalapar
riese spiritual improvisational dance per-
formed to “Head Like A Hole” by Nine
IncliNails,amodcmbzdlctrilispiroddancc
to Sunvlnsky’s “Rite of Spring," and a
depiction of war performed to the
soundtrack from the movie Platoon,
among others.

Kotz‘s piece, Gamelati Evocaliom,
was inspiredby traditionalandcontempo
iary tndonesian dance forms and will be
performed to musrc played by the college

Gamclan Orchestra. “Studying other
cultural forms is educational and inspire
ing, and gives one a greater palate, so to
speak" Kotz commented.

The Dance Troupe has been in ex-
istencein somefonn foroverthlrtyyears.
This is Kotz’s first year as director.

Members of the troupe gave vari—
ousreasonsforjoining. “I‘ve been dance
ing since I was four," said Holbrook-
Spilman. “I docidod not to pursue a
career in dance or go to a big dance
school, but [did want to continue danc-
ing.“

“DanceTroupeg'ves mean artistic
outlet and provides me with physical
activity,” added Desaire.

Tickets for the two performances
are available at the Theater box ofﬁce
until 5:30 today, and at the door before
each performance.

years wnsabox ofﬁce Smash. lt’sthe
story of Stmba, a lion prince, and his
attcmpt to grow up, learn the ways of
the world, take responsibility and
reclaim his throne from an evil uncle.
Sounds Just like our lives! (minus the
evil uncle part). We‘re afraid this
flickdoesn'tmatchup to otherDisncy
greats due to a formulaic plot and a
weaker than usual score, but the ani-
mation is fantasticas usual. We liked
the pig - “Are you talkin‘ to me?"
