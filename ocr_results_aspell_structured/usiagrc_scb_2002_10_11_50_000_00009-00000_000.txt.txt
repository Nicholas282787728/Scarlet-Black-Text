Afghanistan

Not a clever HBO comedy—this weekend's movies!

Bradley: Before we begin. I’d like to apologize to the
Anilnc ehib for some of my remarks last week. The
Animc ehib meets in ARH 303 every Fridry night. and.
despite rny nnnnied olrtttory issues, is a great wry to
spend an evening, espcclally ira third world diama is
playing at Harris. Glad I eonld eleai- that up for yoti .rll.

Baran (PG)

Here’s the Pitch: Lean about the terrors oFAfghani
refugees:

B: Iran: it’s a place offairly regular turmoil. but also
a haven of einema. Anyone who saw the depressing
cultural film A Trnirﬁrr Dion/tor Harm will agree to
that. lsaran is another eritieal darling seen by few nor»
mal regular pcoplct including the two of us.

Set during the rise of the Taliban, the story
rovers Afghani refugees illegally working in a Tehran
eonstruerion yard. When Nalaf
is inyured. hisdrughter Baran dis-
guises her gender, and replaees
her father. Unable to meet
the physieal demsnds or
the job. she is (ranst
rerred, and replaees
Latif. Once he dis-
covers her secret.
the struggle really
begins.

J: Good thing we
have access to all those ‘
legitimate reviews on the lnteriiet. Bar/m is a Film by
Malid Mali'di, an Iranian ﬁlmmaker whose other cied»
its inelneie C/Ierz-n o/‘Hroirn and 7714’ Color off/tine

Maiidi's storytelling power. film critic Roger Ebert tells
the story ora ﬁlm restival showing ofC/n/t/rm omelIm
to a group of young children and their parents. He
introduced the ﬁlm and as it began he expected to heat
a wave or whispers as the parents read aloud the sub»
titles For their children. The theater was silent for the

thildren who eould
not understand the
language or read the

story. Few dueeiors

may well be a poi.

I’m going to The Laramie Project instead.

Jeremy Rainin’ Down the Judgment: Yeah. what's
with the Frlday foreign ﬁlms this year? Regardless. l have
a reeling this ones as good as anything els'e that's shown
this semester.

Panic Room (PG-13)
Here's the pitch: Learn about the terrors ofowning
a huge brownstone in New York City!
Bi There were two reasons why I saw this movie on
opening day: the Flashy yer sound style ofdireeror David
Flncher (who also crafted Sam and Fig/rt Clo/r) and
the exqulslrt: string ofjadie Foster. a nvoetlmc Osear
\vlnnet. i wasnt expecting the mundane sctcenplay
by David Koepp. who also
churned out the rather weak.
cliché script for Spidert
Man.

Meg Altman

(Foster) and her daughter
sniah are spending their ﬁrst night in their new. three
story brownstone when three thieves [Fetest Whitaker,
Dwightvoakani. and Jared Leto) break in. The women
retreat to the house’s heavily proreeted Print Room, but
then seelusion only ei-eates more problems.

Jr There are two reasons i havenr seen this movie: it
was in theaters befoie summer break. and wasn't released
on DVD until after this semester srai ted. Lame excuses.
lknow. but who sees real world movies while in Grinnell?
in the typically lame spring movie season, I remember

yodir Fort” and [trim Stew/(rt no J/Iﬁ'ﬁ'am farm! Lem in no l’tmi: Rimm.

this one standing out just before Spider-Man was re.
leased and invented the May bloekbusrrr. The style of
direetor Fincher is a major draw. and while I don't know
about the seript Brad’s eoinplaining about, 1 have heard
it's a tense and entertaining thriller.

B: Koepp's story is nothing speeial. it follows the
typieal “thriller" path. and has eookie eurter eharaeters.
It is salvaged by plenty ofFinchers elever eamera trielts,
and great perrormanros by everyone in the east. The
trio orvillains bring great variety to their roles. Espe.
eially Dwight Yoaltam, Jeremy. This may have been the
best movie of the spring. but i expected more from
Fincher.

i: Thar says a lot about the spring movie season. eh?
i wander at what point the Films Chairwill distovrr all
the great indies and relatively intelligent blockbusters
released in the early summer.

Cultural Film:
How Tasty was my Little Frenchman

J: \V/Iiata title! It’s brilliant. I haven't seen the movie,
but if it stands tip to the other. eonsisrently great stuff
Cultural Films has brought to eampus this semester, I'd
reeommend spending at least one night in ARH 502.
