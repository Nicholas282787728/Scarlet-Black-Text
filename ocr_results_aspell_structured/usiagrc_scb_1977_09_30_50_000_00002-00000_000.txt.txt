Clark to undergo renovation;
residents will be relocated

By Katherine Kovanda

Students in Clark Hall are
Scheduled to be relocated at the
end 01 the l'ilst semester so that
renovation can begin during
Christmas break on their dorm.

Clark is seen by administrators
as a pilot dorm which will give the
college an estimate as to what the
costs of renovation will be. Ac-
cording to Susan Crim, head of
housing here, the hall was ac-
corded this “pilot” status for
several reasons. First of all, many
of its structural problems are
typical of problems found in dorms
throughout the college. Secondly, it
is located on North Campus, where
the dorms are generally in worse
physical condition than those on
South Campus. Finally, only 42
students live in Clark. This
relatively small number Will allow
for quite easy relocation of the
Clark residents.

CLARK students will be
relocated in four different places.
Smith Annex, one Such relocation
area. will house ten students.
Three residences on Park Street
will take in the other 32 students.
Some Rush Medical students living
at one of the houses on Park Street
will be relocated to another Park
Street house.

Plans for the actual renovation
of the hall call for many en-
vironmental and internal changes
without any real restructuring of
the spatial design of the building. A
major item on the agenda ot
renovations is the replacement or
the mechanical system. This in-
cludes the plumbing, heating and
electrical facilities.

SECONDLY, the bathrooms and
rooms will be modernized, with
new vanities and medicine
cabinets to be installed in the
rooms. In addition. new doors and
hardware. including carpeting in
the lounges and the corridor, will
be installed Furthermore, the
Stairs will be retreaded for
quietness.

Therenovations were planned by
a combination of people, including
Crim, the Board of Trustees and
the Resident Hall Improvement
Committee. The Committee,
composed of Crlm, Harold Horn,
one resident adviser and (our
students, has been in operation for
two years.

REACTIONS among Clark
students to the planned changes
were mixed, ranging from apathy
to happiness about moving off
campus. On the whole, students
with double rooms did not mind the
move because they would probably
get the same kind of room in their
new location.

Those with singles felt dif-
ferently because the chances are

man Greg Richardson feels that
the room changes. coming at finals
time, will be a major in con-
venience.

“I don i want to do it at ﬁnals
time. Right now, I would like to get
my room together but it wouldn't
be worth it because I‘m only going
to be here {or two more months.
Also, they are putting us out and

Nancy Schechter voic such a
pessimistic attitude.

“I DON'T have a good chance of
getting a single and I've got a
single right now. so I really don’t

want to move," Schechter said.

Other students expressed regret
at the timing of the move. Fresh-

NOT ALL Clark students
however, feel negatively about the
renovations and ensuing room
changes. Freshman Tom Kerr has
managed to be mildly optimistic
about the prospect of a new room.

“It will be nice to move out
because maybe then I‘ll get a
better room,” he said.
