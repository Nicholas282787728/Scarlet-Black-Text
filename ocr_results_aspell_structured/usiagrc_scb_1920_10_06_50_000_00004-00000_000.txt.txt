NEED OF INDUSTRIAL
MEN GREAT IN GHINA

Western Civilization and Western
Industry Is Greatest Need
of Far East.

"Oh, look at the hath l'olle!” was
the clever and unanimous comment
that sprung from the -lips of every
wirle~eyeil Prop that attended chapel
Monday morning. Tire Rev. 0. Brass
hamp, attired in a robe presented to
him by a Chinese general whose three
children are being educated iir one
or the sixt'-thl'ee schools in China
'under Rev. Br-askairiii's direction, gave
a brief lint extremely interesting and
illuminating talk on China. Some or
the things that he said ahorit China’s
size and power almost stagger the iln»
aginatioi For instance, there are
tor-tr million people, or 682 to the
Square mile. Nlllcty- live per cent o1
those people are illiterate, hut they
have great possib s and all that
they lack to make them one of the
greatest industrial" and commercial
nations of the world is organization
and leadership.

“They now consider America their
friend and right now is the time for
rrs to teach them the gospel oi Christ
and help in their political and indus-
reorganization. Every year
China imports most oi her coal while
in iiitccn of the eighteen provinces
there is enough coal to last the world
two thousand years. The Chinese are
afraid to dig this heeausc they think
that evil spirits will come out oi the
ground ind destroy them.

Goal is not only valuable inrircial.
hut iron, gypsum, lead and tin need
only to he mined to make them val-
ushlc products. Great quantities ct
wheat are raised and twenty new tlour
nulls were ‘erected last year. Filtecii
lthonsand tons of ilouv “ere shipped
lto Great l3rrtian.

"Badly as she needs American busi-
ness men and business methods,
China’s greatest need is Christian
teachers and doctors. Their death
rate is thir three million a year'7
nearly one every second, Seven out of
ten children die. One American doc»
tor has cured iorty thousand people
‘and says that a medical man will get
.as much experience in one year there
‘Ias he will in ten years here. In the
,iace of all these lacts is there any-one
who can say that their iiie is too mlr
nor-taut to he wasted in China?”

Mr. Braskamp spoke very highly oi

gthe work or alias Sawyer at Gl'iimell

ili China. who is conducting nurses
classes there. At the evening lecture
he showed some slides of the fine
,inodern buildings erected there. One
'0 {the many forward strides in Chin-
ese reorganization is the introduction
of a. national phonetic spelling which
is now being taught. In [act the gov,
ernment has made it compulsory [or
the people to learn this. It consists
of thirty nine symbols, while the old
‘lahgucge contained ﬁfty thousand in
from nine to eleven (liltcreirt tones.

An eraminatron of the various pa.

that there is little diiiercncc between

por-tc- oi Goiornor Cox are plentr

enthusiastic over his candidate. The
League of Nations is the main issue,
with its supporters aligned with Cox
and i opponents with Harding.
Harding is characterized by many as
“sound and conservative" and con-
trasted with the “radicalism" or the
democratic candidate. 0)] the other
hand, Cox's straight forward stand on

PEOPLE BECOMING

Chapel [Speaker Thinks War Has
Caused Narrowness.

The possibility for thorough Ameri-
cans to retain a genuine sympathy for
other nationalities and habits was dis-
cussed by Dean J. S. Nollen in the
chapel service Tuesday. 'During the
recent period in the world's history
when nations have been at war, people
and nations have grown narrow in
their actions and deeds.

Mr. Nollen cited as an example of a
broad man a Gl‘ilmell graduate who
lost his hearing soon after entering his
profession. He now holds a position

in the scientiﬁc department at Washri

ington. Besides this accomplishment}

he is an artist, a poet. a linguist. and‘
a philosopher, He did not give up he—
oause difficulties presented them—
selves. .

The people of today, according loi
Mr. Nollen, must reemrhher Parrlisf
teaching: serve one another in love:
This will do away largely with the‘
tendency to hcconae narrow.
