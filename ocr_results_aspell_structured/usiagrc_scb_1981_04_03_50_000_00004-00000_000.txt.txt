. Grinnell hosts conference on “trends”

by Kim MacDonald

. Perhaps you saw your old high school
social studies teacher wandering
around the Forum on Monday. or
maybe you are curious as to why some
of your classes were cancelled on the
first day back from spring break. All of
this was part of an effort to better
understand what goes on in the
classrooms of both Grinnell and some
high schools across the country.

Forty-six teachers from high schools
in the Chicago area, New Jersey. New
York, Connecticut and Iowa met this
week in Grinnell to talk to professors,
students, administrators and one
another on a variety oi topics ranging
from how writing is taught in school to
what a student can expect in a
freshman English class at Grinnell.

The three~day conference on "Trends
in High Schools and Colleges Today"
was organized by the office of Dean of
Faculty Catherine Frazer and included
inlormal socializing between teachers,
professors and students. But the bulk of
the conference occurred on Monday
when both faculty groups met for three
sessions lasting one and one~half hour
each to discuss specific topics such as
the need for structure in college and
high school programs, the continuity
between high school and college and the
importance of writing ability in all
areas.

According to Frazer. the conference
arose from discussions she had this fall
with Grinnell faculty. Since she was
new to Grinnell, professors often asked
her what she thought of Grinnell
studens in comparison to students in
other schools where she had worked.
She thought it was important to give

“our faculty a chance to hear what‘s go-
ing on in the high schools,"

She developed a list of possible topics
and sent it out to the teachers invited
and Grinnell professors, The three
topics which received the _most
response were chosen and three pro<
fessors were picked to direct the discus-
sions.

Response to the conference has been
favorable on all sides. Linda Rabben.
editor of Grinnell Magazine. attended
three of the discussions and felt they
were "really good for die facility." She
found the conference “of mutual
benefit" for both groups of faculty and
“ultimately (of benefit) for students."
hazer felt the teachers and profusors
"really did talk as if they were people in
the same boat in education." Another
benefit of the conference. according to
Associate Professor of anthropology
Douglas Caulkins, was the exposure to
current high school education which
Grinnell profs gained since “most (of
them) haven‘t been in a high school
since they graduated."

Caulkins and Associate Professor of
English Peter Conneliy both moderated
discussions and each had positive reac-
tions to the conference. Conneliy, who
moderated three groups on the topic
"Writing as the Key to Success in All
Fields," realized some new things dur~
ing the three days. He lound it “very
gratifying" to learn that "writing is not
confined to English classes and
vocabulary comes from all classes" in
the high schools represented. While he
stressed that it was difficult to
generalize on the results of the con~

ference. he felt he has a "better sense of
what a student is likely to think when he
makes an assignment."

"How Can High School and College
Programs Better Reinforce One
Another" was the topic Caulkirls
moderated and he said it led to "con»
crete suggestions" such as more ex-
change between colleges and high
schools by way of teachers visiting
classes and conferences such as this
one. Teachers also discussed "the
creeping vocationalism" in schools and
parental and career counselor pressure
which leads students to early and often
mistaken career choices,

There was a definite sense of com»
mon purpose and respect for the high
school teachers, according to Grinnell
faculty, As Caulkins explained. he
realized that both high school and col-
lege teachers “are working towards the
same goals . . . are in the trenches on
the same side." Conneliy was ”im~
pressed with a common sense of mis-
sion" and Frazer noted that any
changes resulting from the conference
"will work both ways.”

The high school teachers left Tuesday
armed with syllabi, reading lists and a
newly found sense of what education at
Grinnell is really like. Some Grinnell
profs returned to classes with a newly
found sympathy and understanding of
their students' educational
backgrounds, The conference "ended
on a note of euphoria." according to
Caulkins. Several professors and
Frazer were extended invitations to
visit some of the high schools
represented. ‘
