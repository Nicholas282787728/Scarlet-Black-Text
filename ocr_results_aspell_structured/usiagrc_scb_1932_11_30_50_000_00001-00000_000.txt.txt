‘N o Illusions

of Message to
Bring’ Miller

Columnist Spoke at Dinner

for Journalists Here
Last Night

“I harbor no illusion that I have
a message to bring you. It was only.
I assure you, my insatiable curiosity
about Grinnell that tempted me to
accept your Invitation, that and a
grim desire to earn something for a

small down payment on my wife’s
last dress," said Harlan Miller, cons
ductor of the “Over the Coffee” col»
\lmn in the Des Moines Register, who
spoke at the journalistic banquet in
the quadrangle last night,

“Fearless stand Difficult"

In speaking of the so-called power
of the press, Mr. Miller said that if
it is not true that newspapers can
bring order from chaos, at least much
of the population exects the press to
lend the way. It is becoming more
and more difficult for an editor to
take a fearless stand for or against
anything.

Politics and Statesmanship cause
the newspaperman his greatest diffi-
culties. Mr. Miller illustrated this
from the Des Moiues Register and
Tribune's handling of the recent
presidential campaign news. The
editorial columns supported Hoover,
but in the news columns and open
forum columns equal space, or as
equal as possible, was given to the
major candidates.

“Just a Business"

The result, the speaker said, was
bitter Complaints from the Republi-
cans that Roosevelt got all the
breaks, while the Democrats assailed
the paper for being anti-Roosevelt
and pro-Hoover. When the nevfsV
paperman pleads impartiality, the
complaintants say that the papers
are “just a business.”

Mr, Miller thinks that two things
the press lacks is a penetrating, tro-
dition and illusion breaking presents
ing of the truth and that rare thing
called satire. ~lf newspapers would
print stories like those in "Washing-
ton-Merry-G0»Round” and a kind of
satire that "a ten year old child
could understand. yet sharp enough
to penetrate the thick skin of a noun-
ty supervisor, they would be doing
a real service.

In addition to the talk by Mr. Mil-
ler, John Ramsey. as toastmastcr, in—
troduced Arthur Hough, managing
editor of The Scarlet and Black, Ed-
ward Danforth and Stan Hipp, busi-
ness manager and editor of the Mala
tEaSer', who spoke briefly about jour~
nalism and its opportunities on the
Grinnell campus.

This dinner was given by Theta
Sigma Phi and Sigma Delta Chi
Women's and men's journalistic frar
ternities to all freshmen and trans—
fer students interested in journalism.

Guard of the fraternities at the
banquet were Roscoe Macy, editorial
writer for the Des Moines Register,

Richdrd Steiner Stresses
ﬁEconornic Crisis’ at Vespers

In his talk at vespers Sunday of-
ternoon, Richard Steiner emphasized
the fact that the international econ-
omic crisis has forced the people to
place new evaluations upon their be—
liefs and ideals, particularly upon
charity and religion.

It is Mr. Steiner‘s belief that in
times such as these it is the com-
mendable tendency of a people to
cease looking up to the man who has
only the interests of money at heart,
and to accept him who is deeper in-
tellectually and spiritually.

Mr. Steiner, son of Dr. Edward
Steiner. professor of Applied Chris-
tianity. is n graduate of Grinnell
college in the class of '24.

‘Races’ Norris
Topic Sunday

Zoology Professor Talks at
Club Meeting

Stating that the temperament and
character of the Russian of today are
the joint result of his environment
and his heredity, Harry W. Norris,
professor of zoology, addressed the
regular weekly meeting of the Sun-
day evening club, held in the assoc-
iations building, on the subject, “The
Races and Their Ideals".

Dr. Norris devoted his lecture to
Russl, outlining her history down
to the present day, a history marked
by oppression and backwardness, and
showing how her people have inevit—
ably acquired their present charac-
teri‘stics.

Result of Oppression

“The Russian of today r the logi—
cal result of oppression in a country
which stagnated, while its neighbors
advanced,” he asserted. ,,

The earliest Russians were depict»
ed as a simple. peace-loving race,
stolidly accepting oppression, who
gradually expanded until they occu-
pied all of the vast plain to which
they have given their name,

Conquered in the thirteenth cen-
tury by Tartar invaders, they event—
ually [reed themselves, but have
never rid themselves of Asiatic trac—
es. The Tartars combined with the
Orthodox Greek church to oppress
the people, and force them into that
serfdom from which they have but
recently emerged. Their attitude to-
ward religion is but natural, since to
them it has been an instrument of
tyranny.

European in Form

The present Russian government
was said by Doctor Norris to he
European in form. but Asiatic in
management. This is the result of
their former subjugation by the Tar-
tarS. Since the Russians know noth-
ing of democracy. the lower class is
as autocratic as the old czarist ran
gimc, now that it is in power. “The
Russians might as Well be on the
planet Mars, for all that they know of
the affairs of the outside World,"
said the speaker.

Doctor Norris was introduced by
Dave Singer, president of the Sun-
day evcning club.

Sigma Delta Chi Approves
Local Chapter Constitution

A constitution and by-laws for the
Grinnell chapter were presented and

Although the grand council has a

to all chapters, the local organization
decided to make certain local regu»
lotions. Reports of the state mecting
in Ames last wcek were heard and
expense accounts rendered.

House Presidents
Adopt Proposed
Prepping Plan

The proposed plan of the council of
house presidents in regard to prepp-
ing was read and approved at a-mcet-
ing of the council Friday evening.

At the meeting, the chapel com-
mittee of the council reported that
the necessary supplies have been pur-
chased for roping off chapel seats, in
order to get students to sit nearer the
front at Services, and that a schedule
has been arranged for taking care of
the matter.

vestigate the possibility of establish-
ing a ping pong table in the dermis

New Rulings
Effect Style

Pioneer Plays Hard Hit by
Basketball Change

Because of a new rule that has been
sanctioned by basketball moguls and
is being adopted by many of the lead-
ing conferences in the country this
year, Coach John Truesdale is faced
with the problem of changing many
of his offensive plays before the first
game which will be played with Mine
nesota university, Dec. ll).

prevents stalling

The rule has been made to avoid
stalling in the defensive section of
the floor. A line will be drawn
unrnugh the middle of the floor and
the offensive men are to be given 10
seconds to take the ball out of de-
fensive territory._ Once the ball has
been sent out of the defensive point
it can not be brought back until a
shot has been taken at the basket,
and then 10 more seconds will be glv»
on to advance the play again. In
case the ball does pass over the linc
before some player has taken a shot
at the basket, the opposing team will
be given the ball out of bounds.

At a meeting of the Missouri Val»
ley conference board which will be
held Saturday, the coaches will vote
on this new section. Much sen-
timent has been brought against
it. but many coaches feel that it will
serve to speed up the game.

Fast Break Needed

The new rule calls for a fast
breaking offensive unit and during
the past few days in practice Trues-
dale has.been giving his men plays
that will click under the proposed
plan. The guards have been given it
great responsibility to get the ball
out of the territory. Dick llllrich,
Paul McCully and Bob Morgan have
been used at these berths in most of
the practice sessions and have been
showing ability at adapting them-
selves to the new situation.

Several changes may be made in
the lineup before the time for the
first game, but so for seven men
have been showing the majority of

Miss Read’s mother and father are
both living in Shenandoah, and are
expected to come to Grinnell for the
funeral. ,
Although unconscious much of

sciousness a few hours before her
death. The doctor at that time

natural voice, “Just fiu‘c, doctor.”

Miss Read was born in Shenandoah

B. degree from Tabor college in 1895,
and then taught for two years in the
