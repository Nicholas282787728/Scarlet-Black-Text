issues without our consent.

Referring to the politics oi the
letter. McLean ridiculed the fear
oi “violating the holy principle or
non-military intervention." He
reierred to a question put to
William Casey. director of the
CIA. Casey was asked whether the
Contras have a chance of every
throwing the Sandinista Govern
ment. His reply was no. the Us,
supports the Contras in order to
prevent the Sandinistas from tak
ing over the governments or El
Salvador, Costa Rica and Hon-

,duras.

McLean ended his arguments
with the words. “this proposal has
no real connections with the situa-
tion. it eXISLs in a moral vacuum."

Beiore Rob Curley was given
the chance to argue against
McLean. a motion was made to
make the letter "important."
This would then require twos
thirds majority approval instead
of the usual simple majority.

Due to a tie on this motionan 3p,

was passed.

with only three speakers remin~

was made to table the letter to
allow J.l3. members time to cons

given two weeks to consider the

Why the Democrats lost

by laii McLean

The recent drubbing oi the
Democratic Party is by now well
known. and sufficiently depress
ing to warrant a major overhaul
oi the party‘s strategy. and high
time, too, The Democrats have
lost four of the last five presidens
tlal elections, lost control at the
Senate, and (if some analysts.
both Republican and Democrat
are to be believed) are in danger
or losing the House by was, Cons
Ventional Democratic rationalizas
tion over this state of affairs has it
that. this time the DemocraB
were simply doomed by the “Ims
age Problems", at Reagan “brains
washing" oi the electorate into an
orgy of flagswaving which
obscured the basic issues. But the
issues of the campaign were clear
enough - increased vs. low taxes,
increased vs. decreased arms
spending, the probability of war,
arms control and deficits. etc;
and the Democrats could have
gone a long way with them. Yetall
of the party‘s attempts seemed to
fall on deal ears. But these ears
were not deal, they were simply
listening to the "other message' of
the Democratic party. a message.
which inadvertantly or not. was
almost calculated' to criticize
American voters and turn them
off. It was this message and the
mistakes which compunded it that
created the Democrats' "image
Problem."

This “other message” was first
sounded in San Francisco. with
the speeches of Mario Cuomo.
Jesse Jackson et al, The San
Francisco convention stressed
almost nothing but total economic
disaster, social divisions more ap»
proprlate to classical Sparta than
to the contemporary US. the
spectre of imminent nuclear war
precipitated by a U.S.-initialed
arms race. The convention's am-
biance was demdedly hostile to
middle and lower-middle class
values and aspirations. a
veritable repudiation oi the
groups needed to form the pivot bl
any electoral victory. The San
rraiic sio convention portrayed
America as a nation dedicated to
the shallow pursuit of wealth by
the callous elites who inhabited
Mario Cuolno's “shilling city."
Since most of middle America
perceived itsell as somehou
benefittlng irom Reagan's tenure
in office. such rhetoric was an
unintended yet unmistakable slap
in the lace, Moreover. there was
no invisible sincere attempt at a
display oi a genuine liking oi

America, Such attempts consisted
oi bouts oi flag-waving sandwich-
ed in between speeches which
seemed to condemn every tacit oi
American life in the last four
years The unpleasant Visage ot
America presented by the
Democrats was highlighted and
and locked into the minds of the
electorate in late August: In
Dallas. the opposition seemed to
stress the greatness oi America
and its ability to be greater. in
San Francisco, however. the
Democrats were seen as choosing
to stress America's failures and
its one last chance to claw its way
up to some sort of moral acceps
tablity.

Though the organizers oi the

ana 281$

convention might be defended to
the grounds that convention
rhetoric is a peplalk to the con
verted, Democratic strategists
should realize the conventions are
overtures. not rehearsals They
are the first major exposure of the
electorate to a party's ideas and
opinions of the voters and the
country they live in. San Fran-
cisco so heavily seasoned the
Democrats' initial exposure with
invectlve criticism of the counlry
that Americans were left with an
unpleasant taste in their political
mouths of the rest of the cam-
paign.

Having started off on the wrong
toot. the Democrats proceeded to
sprint on it. Geraldine l-‘erraro’s
controversial taxes and her pro-
longed, unproiitable and un-
necessary argument with the
Church lost the campaign both

and a relusal to talk about cutting
anything in the budget besides the
increase in defense spending pro
duced an almost Iilsurmountable
mass at negative images. As the
canipign went on it became clear
that the party had painted itsell

To get their proposals across.
the Democrats needed to be seen
as possessing a dynamic and fresh
philosophy backed by a solid pars
ty and a forceful leader convinced
oi the party's unique ability to
provide the foundation blocks of a
great nation Instead. the
Democratic party sent bud
signals to the electorate. signals
which painted the party as a re-
run al a New Deal Twponse to con-
temporary problems oi lacking
strong leadership, of being loos
much iniluenced by special in
terest groups. and of rejecting the
values and ideals oi the very peas
pie whom they needed to elect
them. These signals hurt the party
badly. as can be seen by the suc-
cessful Democratic congressional
candidates. who avoided the na-
tional image oi the party like the
plague, and by the voters who told
exit pollers that “‘ ' voted for
Reagan because he was
"American".

The problem was not one of
mere ”packaging", It was the
result of a fundamental omission
of the foundations oi any great
party's campaign 7 a visible
reaffirmation of the goodness of
American and a deep-seated
message that one‘s ideas are
rooted, not in ethnic power-
politics or rejections oi traditional
values, but in a love of the special
promise of America. No doubt
these feelings were there {mm the
beginning. but they were never
really driven home until 7 Alas!
