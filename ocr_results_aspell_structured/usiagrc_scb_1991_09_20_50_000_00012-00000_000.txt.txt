Men's soccer defeats Blueboys 3-1

By Steve Johnston

The men‘s soccer team began the
season with a scoreless tie against
nationally ranked St. Thomas

Grinnell took to the ﬁeld knowing
tltat St Thomas‘ control oriented of-
fense would match up well against
Grinnell‘s Strong defense. Grinnell
forwards Papa Owusu and Sean
Ramsey and midfielders Mike
Stenberg, Alex Kranjec, Bruno
Alicke, and 1 eff Stadler put an effec-
tive trap on the St. Thomas attack.

St. Thomas was left without an
escape route and was held scoreless
throughout the first-half. Unfortu-
nately, so was Grinnell.

The second- half began and so did
the rain. Grinnell's defense, led by
co-captains Matt Schrager and Erich
Giebelhaus, kicked the “Mountie
crap" out of the St. Thomas offense.
Several saves by frosh goalie Nate
Brennarnan and excellent teamwork
by Grinnell midﬁelders and forwards
kept the enthusiasm and excitement
going throughout the entire match.

At the end of the second»half of
play, the match was still scoreless,

which meant the game would go into
two overtimﬁ of 15 minutes apiece.
For the next 30 minutes,Grinnell and
St. Thomas struggled to score but
they came up empty, and the game
ended in a ()0 tie.

Despite the loss, the ”team has
stepped up our game 10 to lZnotches
and are confident in our ability to be
contenders in our conference this
year," said Doug Hodum.

After a solid performance against
nationally ranked St. Thomas, the
Pioneers were ready for their ﬁrst win
against the defending conference
champions, the Illinois College
Blueboys.

A conﬁdent and intense Grinnell
squad took the ﬁeld and set the tempo
ofthe game, keeping the action on the
Pioneers‘ offensive endGrinnellcre-
ated several first-half scoring oppor-
tunities but failed toput the ball in the
goal.

In the secondvhalf, Grinnell came
onto the ﬁeld with a vengeance For-
ward Papa Owusu scored l5 minutes
into the second on a shot which rico-
cheted off a Blueboy fullback and
into the goal.

The Blueboys scored 10 minutes
later when a Pioneer missed his mark
on athrow in,and theball was headed
in over the hands of Brennaman.

The Grinnell offense had several
opportunities to score during the re-
mainder of the second» half butjust
couldn’t get their balls in the goal.
Thus with the game tied at 1 apiece.
the Pioneers found themselves in yet
another ovenime situation.

Frosh Zack Dietz scored five min-
utes into the ﬁrst-half of overtime,
when the Blueboy goalie lostcontrol
of the ball and Dietz tapped the ball
into the goal, giving Grinnell a 2 to 1
lead.

Five minutes later, sophomore
powerhouse Papa Owusu dribbled
brilliantly around Blueboy defenders
to easily score on the unsuspecting
Blueboy goalie. Thisput Grinnell up
by two points.

The Pioneers held the Blueboys
scoreless in the second-half and the
match ended with Grinnell winning
3-1.

Grinnell travels to Coe on Tues—
day for another conference match.

Experienced defensive play helped
stall the Principia offense in the sec-
ond half. Senior linebacker Lee
Kraemer sacked the Principia quar-
terback three times and intercepted
him once. Free safety Todd McGuire,
cornerback Ty McGuire, and line-
backer Bob Reason also intercepted
passes.

by our seniors late in the game," said

defensive strategy was to “force
Principia to take a lot of passes to get
into the end zone."
