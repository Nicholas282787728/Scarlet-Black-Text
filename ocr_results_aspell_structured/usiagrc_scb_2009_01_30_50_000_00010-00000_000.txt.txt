A new semester packed w th SGA and professor talks

Improving student government

Last semester BSA was an organization adrift, without the
rection or organi' tion, It had trouble accomplishing even its
more pedestrian r ponsibil es, to, y nothing of
leading in innovative new projects. At the end of , '
last semester and the start of this one SGA has
shown improvement.

At the close of last semester, the campus was
awash in amriety over the future of st ~crovers
trance and student life at Grinneu Col ue. This
came on top of unprecedented levels 0 ohol~
re rited hospitalizations and under the specter of
impending budget cuts. students were actions and energized,
but had not put .\ voice to that energy. As the campus’s dc tacto
student leaders and the ofﬁcial inrerinediiuy between students
and the adininlstirition. it is up to SGA to trike the lead ads
dressing student concerns, For too long, it has not.

SGA showed difﬁculty accomplishing its more mundane
tasks as well. We've seen Cabinet bunglc election results while
Joint Board meetings seemed—at least compared to last year's
level ofactlviryitoo passr le. There were no rnccc-and-greers
with sea members and minutes have not been posted on the
SGA website since last year.

Communicationwith the student body was cursory at best,
as exempliﬁed by SGA President Net) Morake's ’09 State of the
College address. Morake's speech was less than ten minutes,
after which there were zero questions or answers. In the lead
up, mere were no posters advertising the event, despite Cabinet
paying a student solely to poster the campus

Even those substantive successes SGA has enjoyed have not

' statdrr‘ona‘i

been well publicized, Did anyone know that students might
soon serve on the Committee for Academic Standing, for iii-
stance? Unsurprisingly, the answer, for most, is no.

Despite early srrugglcs, SGA has recently shown greater

promise and direction. Last sc-
mestcr‘s second crop of initiatives
avoided serious problems, while
last semester's open forum was a
welcome opportunity for snidents
and administrators to hash out
their differences. And there have
been some prominent incidents of
successful student advocacy with
regards to the school of the Americas trip, the college's pet
policy, and student transportation policy.

Last week’s SSE article revealed an organization that had
resolved its communication difﬁculties and problems with his
slitution.il memory, In addition, 29 students ran in this week's
Joint Board elections which, with the exception of a minor
technical glitch related to srnounktrvotingpasscd without int
cidenti Cabinet hooted ‘sl forum dedicated to student initiatives
Wednesday at this week, We applaud l'licsc successes.

While SGA has not yet emerged as a pinnacle of student
organization and activity, there has been a noticeable improve
menr and it should continue on this trajectory. We look forward
to a more innovative and guiding Cabinet and an animated and
engaged Joint Board.

Ongoing search for new faculty
Last Fiiday, Grinnell students packed into ARH 102 to list

ten to Rob Lewis, History, present his dissertation on Parisian
stadium culture.

Though an obscure topic, on a Friday afternoon no less,
upwards ofSO students showed up to support Lewis,who seeks
to secure a tenure-track position .is a Modern European His—
tory prot'e or, Though maybe it’s a stretch to claim that every
student in that room is interested in Parisian stiitlium culture,
it isn’t at stretch to claim that many students like having Lewis
teach at Grinncll College.

\Vhile the lnige number ofstutlents, both History and other
majors, that attended this event is far from disheartening, the
fact that the turnout is considered somewhat extraordinary is
disheartening.

Though the turnout tor Lewis was impressive, there are
other positions in the English, Span' ,Marh, Religious Studr
ies, and other departments that are go rg to be filled in the vcry
near futuic.1n order to keep the faculty that makes Grinnell
classes engaging, as students we should show a greater interest
and enthusiasm in attending candidate presentations and gerr
ting feedback to inembe " ofSEl’Cs and fatality chairs.

The benefits oflargcr student involvement manifest them-
selves insofar as maint. hing or ameliorating the quality ofpro~
fessors at Grinncll and candidates that see student enthusiasm
might be more willing to come to the tundra ol‘lowa,

Increased student paiticipation is not only necessary in the
search for new faculty, but also in the search {or new RLCs.
Greater student involvement means ensuring that we gain
RLCs who we can turn to, and gain RLCs who want to be
involved in the Griniicll college community, thus hopefully
avoiding the kind of turnover that has become typical in recent
memory.

The importance of remaining actively engaged in learning

Thank you for bringing 3 decades of dance

I would like to thank Professor Shawn VVomuck for sliar-
ing her performance ot“overTime: Three Decades otDance”
with the Grinncll community on Jan 22. It was empoweiing
to see strong, conﬁdent. wise women dancers working in such
a cohesive way. The bond between the four dancers who had

spent decades creating dances and performing together was so
obvious on stage that it became another element orrhe perforr
mance and choreography

My favorite dance was “Pageant". I loved the speciﬁcity of
ruovcruenr at the beginning, the humor amid the well-crafted
content and the implied meanings orevery look and gesture.

I know the choreographer, dancers, and tech crew put a lot

or work into the performance and 1m only sad we couldn’t host
you for longer and share your performance with more Central
lowans

Thank yotr so much for coming to Grinncll and sharing
your Iiighrquality dance with us!
