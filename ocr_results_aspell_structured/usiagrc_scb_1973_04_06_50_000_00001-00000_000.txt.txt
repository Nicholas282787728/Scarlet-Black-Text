Constitutional

Voto Monday

by John Wylie

Grinnell students will vote Mon-
day on two amendments to the SGA
Constitution dealing with reorganle
zation of the Judicial Council and
streamlining the Joint Boards,

Amendment number one will abol-
ish the hall judicial councils and
replace them with a North and a
South Campus Council, nominated
by the hall presidents and approved
by the reSidents.

it is hoped by the proposal’s bace
kers that the move tqtake Judicial
Councils out of the halls and cens
trallze them on each campus will
help remove the tensions and tires
sures inherent ill a hall council
system,

The proposal would also establish
the Office of Community Rights to
settle Conflicts among students in a
non-judicial setting. In addition, the
Judicial Council would be expanded
to seven members, two iaculty and
five students, and a student chair-
man would be required.

Changes in the Judicial Council's
procedure under the proposal would
eliminate many of the ambiguities
which exist under the Council’s
present charter.

The second proposal would stream-
line the Joint Boards by eliminating
EPC members as voting members
and providing deﬁnite recall pros
cedures fur SGA officials,

Under the amendment, elected ot-
ficials could be removed by petis
tions signed by 15% oi the body
affected and a two-thirds vote of
the Joint Boards.

Voting will be by ID card in the
Post Office Monday between the
hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.ln. QueSs
tions should be directed to the
Coordinator's otllce at extension

The primary iunction oi the Coor—

year, Genereux told the S&B,will be
“establishing channels of commun—

Genereux is presently considering
issues relating to dormitory liteand
orientation of freshmen next year.
A proposal regarding the painting
oi dormitory rooms is presently be
ing worked out, he Said, and James
Hall will be experimenting next year
with having faculty members serve
two-week stints as the Resident Ad-
visor. Genereux will be conducting
an evaluation at that experiment
next year.

On the academic side, Ruhl sees
his position as one of evaluatingnCr
ademic proposals before the EPC’s
and the faculty. “I'll be researching
to iind out where problems might
crop up,” he said, “and trying to
iind ways to alleviate them beiore
they develop ”

issues with which ltuhl lS pi‘er

Theft Incidents
Stimulate Concern

by Bonnie Roswig

Following serious thefts of stereo equipment from student rooms last
Saturday night and rising campus concern over the question oi stealing
from student rooms and college buildings, several students confronted

Dean Waldo Walker

at the Dean's open forum last Wednesday night,

addressing the question oi campus security,

Dean Walker agreed to arrange a limo- [or a meeting next week with
Chief Peters, interested students, and other officials to discuss the problem

further,

Juniors Jane Lukic and Amanda
Golbeck were the victims of the st-
ereo equipment theit. At 1:00 a in
last Sunday morning Jane and Anie
Linda returned to their room in les
ble Annex.

“The first thing I nolicied wlis
that the door was opened," said
Jane. However, Amanda was posi—
tive she had locked the door before
they leit, two and one ball hours
earlier. Broken glass and iui-niture
was scattered around the floor,
Suddenly both girls realized that
their linked turntables were gone

”...My first reaction was to dial
the town operator," explained Ame
anda. However [he Dibble Annex
phone was dead, so she had to go to
Dibble. “I waited live minutes [or
the town operator to answer,” re-
lated Amanda, "but She never ans-
wered, so I Called the college op-
erator," Amanda said she asked
the college operator to send the
police to their room.

By this time, Jane had contacted
some members of the hall to iind
out ii anyone had seen anything
related to the robbery, and a small
group formed It was at this point,
said Jane, that she saw [our young
men walking up the stairs to tier
ﬂoor.

“I didn’t recognize them as Stil-
dents,” she said However, deco:-
ding to Jane, upon seeing the com—
motion the young men started to
return down the stairs after only
making it up hall way. “I called
to them, ‘Hey, do you guys know
anything about my stereo being stole
en?" said Jane.

However the young men seemed
to resent the tact tliatJdlle might

he implicating them in the theft.
One oi the students observing the
Scene followed the men out of Dib-
blc and saw them go towards the
Collegerowned housing on Park St.

Eventually a policeman was sent
to Dilllile Annex.

The girls explained that when the
policeman arrived, his investiga-
tion was limited to asking questions
about the serial and model numbers
of the stolen turntables Jane and
Amanda felt that a more thorough
investigation was warranted, but
“When I asked the policeman about
linger prints,” she said, “hemati-
etl at me like I hadwatchedloo many
detective movies."

After a fruitless meeting with the
police on Sunday morning, Jane and
Amanda contacted President Glenn
Leggett. Leggett in turn set up a
meeting with Chief Peters.

”Peters tried to assure us that
he'd do everything he could lohelp,"
Said Amanda. “The main emphasis
oi our talk was on policeecollege
relationships, Every time a policce
man walks on campus there is In-
stant paranoia-always a negative
