Odds And Ends

Each week cards disappear from the Student Union;
North campus is having serious trouble with stealing, and
now a typewriter has been taken from the Bookstore.
That’s a powerful lot of theft for a school renowned for

Mortar Board and Friars have more than adequately
fulfilled their aim of service to the campus by sponsoring
the Friday afternoon coffee hours. Some of the most mem-
orable college moments come from these, colloquia, and
spontaeneous coffee breaks with the faculty in the union.
We‘d like to see more and more informal faculty»sl:udent

relationships built. It’s one of

the most rewarding features

of avsmall college, and we’ve still got a long way to go.

Madam Editor:

may 1 voice an appeal through
your columns?

Two weeks ago Buildings and
Grounds made for me, at my
request, a small table-top wood-
en stand to sit on the top oi
”he lecture table in room 123.
(My neck was getting out of
joint, looking down El. my notes,
and then up to the class—an
arc of 90 degrees every 15 sec
ends.)

One week ago, when I went to
use it our the first time, it was
gone. A student reported having
seen a faculty member carrying
it away. (Fortunately he could
not remember the name.)

Will you please get youl own
made and stop wagging mine
away? If you wish to return it
after dark some night there
will be no questions asked. (The
room number is on the botwm
side~l23),

Upperclassmen (sophomore:
and above) are technically al-
lowed nine cuts in a row, but
must attend class the tenth per-
iod. This seems to be so negli-
gible as to be no rule at all, but
certain professors announce that
more than four euis “will in-
dicate a lack of interest and re-
sult in a failing grade." This is
known as putting the proverbial
damper on student enthusiasm.

Religion is important at Carle-
ton. They therefore have compul-
sory chapel three times a week.
(Personall , I agree with the
Bishop who, when asked to
choose between compulsory re~
lig'ion and no religion at all,
said, “My mind is not subtle
enough to grasp the difference")
A student is allowed four cuts
from each chapel session or a
total of twelve. More cuts than
the allotted nmnber results in
chapel probation. Oven-cutting

sults in a two week suspension.

Main Hall Exhibits
Chagall's Elchings
0f “La Fonlaine"

Marc Chagall’s illustrations of
"The Fables of La Fontaine" are
now being exhibited in the Main
Hall foyer. The etchings are ac-
companied by selections of the
text from the recent Marriane
Moore translation.

The exhibit. which is circu-
lated by the Museum of Mods
ern Art in New York, is one of

the most important to be shown
at the college for many years,
Edith Sternfeld, head of the art
department said this week.

Russian-born Chagall is an an
tisl: of international fume and
has works in the pennanent col»
leclions of the more prominent
art museums in countria all
over the world.

“Chagall’s art is highly im-
aginative; often bordering on
the dream-like quality of sur-
realism, and his prints are filled
with fantasy, often in defianw
of the law of gravity," Miss
Sternfeld said. The etchings ex-
hibited here are delicately and
softly colored in contrast. to
Chagall‘s more typical brilliant
coloring.
