Owners, Non-Owners RecrciL
to New Leash Policy

by Brent Schondelmcyer
Pets have established themselves
as a perennial problem ai Grinnell.
Latest in the pet problems, was
action Wednesday night by SGA that
would require all dogs to he on lea-
sh while on all campus property
including college—owned housing.
Approved by the Joint Boards, the

l|IlllllllilllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII matter now goes to the President

tor his approval and will then be
returned to the Committee on Sn.
cial Policies and Regul ion ror
implementation. Eequi ng that
dogs be kept on leashes would or—
ing the college’s policy in confor-
mity with existing city ordinances
in the town.

doe Feldman, head or the FetOwn-
ers Organization (P00), was not
aware or the new leash provision
in the pet policy until the day lol.
lowing thc SGA meeting.

Sixth 8i West

The proposition to re—instate the
leash law railed 165 tO 251. SGA
ofﬁcials stressed that the vote was
iniormational and not binding on
campus policy.

reldmnn complained that during
the moratorium tomniaints conce.
rning dogs were Supposed to be
iorwarded to P00 irom the Student
Artairs Oiiice and the Pet Board.
Poo, Feldmzn claimed, received
complaints lrom Student Arrairs due
ring the moratorium, but did Ilnt
receive any (mm the Pet Bonrd
until the day beiore the reieren—
dnm.

Feldman acknowledged problems
with pets harassing persons on cam—
pus, and getting into garbageintowtl
but “none seemed so insurmounta—
ble thattheycouldn’tbeworked out."

Unleashing on the SGA, Feldmarl
commented, “That the pet owners

(@

LEASH ‘EM UP

went through all that work and 1
po‘jcy is worse than what it was
heiore. l rind it absolutely incre.
d‘lble." ‘

Previously dogs only had to be un-
der voice command.

Nina Adams of the Pet Board st—
ressed that that body w: only an

dninistrative group for implemou.
ting policy established is, SGA. it
receives coinp'aints and “1. es de-
cisions as to the appropri . action.
it also overs es the wurk oithe cam.
in; dog catcher.

The new policy will not go into ef-
rect, Adams stated, until pd‘Olicity
can reach the campus community
through the Campus Mcmn,the Sc—
arlet Rv Black, and letters to re.
gistered pet ow:

Sandy Rikoon, campus dogcatcher,
commented that he did not pick up

dogs unless he received complaints.
This would be true of the new leash
law as well. It would not be diffi—
cult to enforce the leash law, he
felt, as long as people continued In
camp‘ain.

Reactions to the possib ity were
varied among students d .stioned.

Sean Ellis, freshmen, commented,
“Unless they’re gonna put leashes
on grasshoppers, they oughta keep

rem off 01’ rover."

Senior Cal Emery remarked, ”The
leash law is necessary and onlylair
to those who have to live with the
animals on campus.”

Danny Kester, sophomc :‘e, said he
felt, "I don’t think there should be
leash laws -- if the dogs should
have leashes, so Should you."

Another sophomore. Henry Col-ri—
ell, cautioned, “I like to see dogs
roaming around having a good time,
as long as they don’t shit on my
shoes.”

One senior contended that it was
”a matter of trusting people --
I would rather not have the dogs
on 'eash -- but thﬁ requires res-
Feasibility."

Some commliilr‘s were leveled at
the mmder in which SGA had han-
dled the new pet policy.

Dinna Kelly, viceapresident of Ja-
mcn, remarked,

“The imyortant thing is that the
SGA people refused to go back to
their dams and discuss with the
members of their damn: what the
new amended proposal was."

Frank Stoler, sophomoremas per-
turbed at the unresponsiveness to
Student d-BSIr 'S and lack of regard
for the student preference expres-
sed in the referendum.

”The attitude of the Pet Board

and now the SGA Seer o be to
make the decision early in the game
and no matter what the campus says
-- tough luck."
‘ Freshman Bruce Sallie ger ada
dad a different p” spa v'e to the
whole or stion when he comment—
ed. ”Ask {he dogs."
