FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1941

0 Fun For Grinnell.

Everybody either got blistered feet or badly cracked kneesl
A lot of those present may have wished they had pillows
strapped to their posteliorsl The “fieldhouse” ﬂoor probably
sagged several feet.

But standing over and above all the woes that were so
much fun getting, is the fact that the roller skating party
Saturday night hit a new high for really genuine funint
least for the Grinnell campus.

It Seems to us that in this party were met all the
answers to Grinnell’s social “questions." Everybody mixed,
and then some; there were just as many dateless girls and

 

fellows as couples, and for once the stags didn’t have to feel"

out of place.

And most of all, the students let their hair down
and had some fun, real fun. Maybe the Grinnellian isn’t
as blase and worldly as he would like everyone to think
—or just possibly the Grinnell student has a basic, in-
born love for the rollelskate that‘s been hidden all these

years.

At any rate to Miles and his cohorts we owe a vote of

thanks for a good function.
how about another one?

When these blisters are gone,

TEE PARSONS GAME: The “Second-Half” Grilmell Pioneers come
to life in the last two quarters to bear out our predictions that GrlnA
nell would win by three touchdowns. . . From the Quarterbacks club
comes this story. . l When Gn‘nnell made its first touchdown, O'Connor
turned to Duke and said that it was a nice play by Rees. . . Douglas
turned around and contended that Hamzmn mode the touchdown.
. . And as it turned out Hock officially made the Lally.

A RIJ'MPUS: Our little cinch about: the band getting phys.
eil. credit seemed to have hit n sore spot, and nuthoritut-ivc
sources refuse to speak further, . . Hus defense priority cut
out the coriec, doughnuts, etc, that have in the past been
served to press box inhabitants?

GRID HIGHLIGHTS: Ray Mathews’ ﬁne block of the last man in
the path of Harry Waters touchdown run, . , The band, under the
direction of Kenneth Simmons, should be given a couple of nods for
the fine performance they have given so far this season. . _ The
preps showed improved cheering spirit at the game Friday, but some
of ‘am are still pretty cocky. . . Men and girls included. , . The
ieferceing has been exceptionally good this season. . . The work of
energetic Zud Sclicmmcl was noted in last Fridays game.

THE HOMECOMING GAME: This year the Pio-
neers play host to the Beloit Blue Devils on No
vember 1, which is the Homecoming tilt, Ale
though the Wisconsin team has lost all four of its
conference starts, the game cannot be taken too
lightly. . Remember what happened two years
ago, when Eddie May, negro Beloit back, ran wild
during the second half, erasing s 19 to 6 deficit
and chalking up a 26 to 19 win for Beloit.

CONFUSING STATISTICS: In a game last

weekend, the Texas Mines eleven hill-cw 60

forward misses and completed 60 per cent
for is total of 300 yards, yet last 21 to 0.

A TOUGH LINE: Pioneer linemen expressed one opinion
that the forward wail of Poisons was much tougher than
that of Drone. i . The Bulldog line took is beating his: satur-
day as the mini trounced them, 40 to or 4 . Too bad!

This study wasn’t made out of
idle curiosity, Burma. Said. Recent
studies of divorce shows that the
most common disdupting factor is
a. fundamental difference in the
types of individuals divorced.
Either the marital partners dif-
far in cultural background, age,
morals, financial position, or some
other important factor to such an
extent that romance wasn't
strong enough to bridge the gap.

According to Burma, marriages
which are the culmination of col- .
icgc days romances are more 4 ”mos/7),.)
stable than average, and this
study shows that such stability is
definitely to he expected from our
own college couples.
