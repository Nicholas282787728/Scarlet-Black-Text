Incarceration via loggia

The difference between South

Have you ever wondered why the South
campus lnggia is enclosed while that on
North Campus is opcn> it’s not because
South campus is more exposed to bite
ter northwest winds, Rather, the South
campus loggia was designed to iucaiccrare
women students.

Until the
nlld’1960l5 and
the advent of
coed doims,
women lived
on South Came
pus and men
on North. The
women had “hours": 3:00 pm. on weekdays,
10:00 on Friday and 11:00 on Saturday for
first-years; and 10:00 on weekdays, 11:00
on Fridays and 12:00 on Saturdays for upper
class women.

Women who were late, (after the log,
gia doors were locked) had to enter through
Main and be “clocked” by a monitor, with
various punishments to be administered for
“late minutes".

From the construction of the South and
North campus dorms during World War 1,
until the shift to coed living in thc19605 our
campus was governed by the radically sexist
dogma that if the women were controlled,
the men also would be under control.

So, the women were locked up at night,
while the men were not. In fact, the men's
dorms were pretty good places to study until

was a men's college linked to a women's
college by central campus in classes, labs,
library and student union (an old wooden

During all four years, the men livetl in
the same dorm, passing through l . ig and
initiation as freshmen, after which they were
embraced in a fraternity-like atmosphere,

1 was a North Younker man for four years
,and that was important to me. The women,
on the other hand, started in three fresh-
men dormitories: Meats, Main and Clever
land, moving in subsequent years among the
remaining South campus dorms.

Many of my contemporaries think that
the old system was preferable to today‘s
living arrangement I, on the other hand,
having watched the natural communal re:
iarionships that now exist between men and
women (as opposed to our relationships,
which largely depended on the artifice of
dating") appreciate the vast improvement
in today’s Grinnell residential life.

Since the first incident, students and ﬂier
ulty and startiiavc rallied in support of those
targeted by these attacks I've seen signs of
written support in the halls and signs ofquict
support in the classroom. Privacy issues coni—
plicare support for those who iccewecl hateful
icrrcis, but we should not think that only 35
students (or however many have been diiecrly
attacked) need that supportive should set the
community which we actively create against
the alienating rorcc behind these incidents.
Remind those aioiind you that, despite the tie
tai or trivial diffeiences which distinguish us
from each other, we choose to value each othei.
No, really, say “I choose to value you ”You'll
only reel foolish for a moment; what they feel
will last longer. Remind them and remind
