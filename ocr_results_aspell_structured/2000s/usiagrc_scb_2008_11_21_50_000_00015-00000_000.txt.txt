Jordan’s musings on the decline of the

world of the sports blogosphere

on Nov. 13, 2008, a titan ofthe sports blogospherc was cut
down in their prime. Ereioemorgantoin was never the best-
looking blug. Its layout style was its atrocious as an old school
Citnucks ﬁying v jersey, and it made your eyes water worse than
if you had been struck by Sonny Liston, but it had that extra
something that made you keep coming back again and again.
The sire didn’t measure up compared to other top'blogs when
using traditional stilts itltcy never won a coveted Golden Key
board award ibut that didn't stop the national media from
fawning over it.

Even as sabeimetricians tried to convince the world that
more sophisticated stats such as FIP (Fan Independent P05?
ings) suggested FJM was acnially one otrhc worst websites in
the history ofthe Internet, the national media held ﬁlm in their
beliefs that if the eBay‘s storefronts were filled solely with FIM
writers thatit would be considered the greatest invention in the
history of mankind “They had things that can't be measured
using numbers,m The mainstream media would say. “Dirk has
the intangibles that will drive any website to he successfulJut
nior is maybe the grittiest blogger out there, and Ken Tremor
dous is one of the whitest people you will ever meet."1t didn't
matter that the Blogger Bible rated them 2 Nate McLouth-
esquc 3s laughs worse than the average baseball journalism
“meta-criticism blog"bccause Murblcs used to he a punter for
the University of NebrasktrKearney,

One orthe worst parts about having ro see such a ﬁne site
like FJ'M shur down is that your tribute to them will inevitably
pale in comparison to everything these ﬁne gentlemen have ever
written. It is only by the sheer high quality of their writing that
they could turn such a niche topic into one ofthe most widely
read and highly revered blogs in existence. Ifyou have not been
fortunate enough to have read this site previously,1 implore
you to go to ﬁrejoemorgancom and read through their archives
starting at the beginning. You will not be disappointed.

Unfortunately, this loss ofa pioneer couldn’t come at a worse

crs Association of America (BBWAA) has made maddening
choices. I'm at the point where I'm pretty sure that the BBWAA
is starting to pick award winners based on how it will infuri-
ate all of
us nerds
out there
that actu-
ally want
the stats
we use to
accurately
represent reality as best they can. I mean, Jason Bartlett was
voted the fifth best player in the American League by one
writer.

Yes, that same Jason Bartlett who missed 34 games while
sporting a paltry .382 slugging percentage and playing the
waist defense of his career. That writer should be stripped of
his credentials so fast it would make Benjolinson's head spin,

One single vote cannot completely mar an entire award,
but when dozens of baseball writeis come together to make
the worst MVP choice since Jimmy Rollins in 2007, some
thing needs to be said I don’t want to take anything away from
Dustin Pedroia, he had a fantastic season, but Joc Mauer dc-
served ro win the MVP award. l-lis OPss—(on base plus slug-
ging)7 was far and away better than Pedroia’s (137 to 122).
and he did it while playing a position that rakes a far greater
physical and mental toll. In addition, he led all AL hitters in
WA (a stat which helps to quantify the “clutch" aspects of the
game by providing context for when plays occur) and became
the second catcher ever to win the American Leagie batting
Title.The ﬁrst was Joe Mauer.

Why then did the BBWAA pick Pcdroia to win? Pedroia
did become the smallest MVP since the 47" Wildﬁre Sehulte
was given the award by the Chalmers Automobile company in
1911 based on grit, determination, and his unrelenting racism.
But if you want to give the award to the smallest player out
there, why didn’t they give it (0 Eddie Gaedel in 1951? At least
his OPS was 1,000 that year.

Firejeemetganeom used to let me know that I wasn‘t the
only on: getting ridiculously angry at seemingly meaningless
awards.Thc feeling that baseball journalists were being aggres-
sively ignorant about the sport they cover wasn’t just all in my
head.They made me feel sane, all the while making me laugh
uncontrollably and {or that they will be sorely missed.

Men’s Cross Country makes Dlll
Nationals for first time since 1991

BY Mm: KLerNE

With a fourth place finish at the NCAA Central Regional
meet, the men's cross country team qualiﬁed for a spot at Na-
tionals.The men ﬁnished with 157 points, only 19 short ot’sec-
and place.

“Our race performances have sorted themselves in such a
way that we have groups of guys that can run together and push
each other," said Sam Calisch’lﬂ.

As at-large qualiﬁers, the Pioneers will join St. Olaf Colt
loge, Nebraska Wesleyan University, and st. John College from
the Central chion to compete in the NCAA D3 Nationals,
which will be held in Hanover, Indiana this Saturday. In the
past, only two members or the Gnnnell men's cross country
team made it to Nationals~Drake Ballew ’09 and co-captain
David Montgomery '10.

on the men's side,eo-captain Henry Reich '09 led the Pier
nears with a 20th place finish. Calish followed him in 27th,
Montgomery in 33rd, Noah DeLong '11 in 34th, and Alex Rev
ich '11 ﬁnished 53rd. According to Nick sparr'09, consistency
played a big part in this year’s performance for the team, while
staying focused allowed the team to remain healthy and injury—

ﬁee throughout the entire season.

On the women’s side, the Grinnell women's cross country
team ﬁnished 17th, after ﬁnishing 7th in Nationals just two
years ago. “I think it really was the women two years ago that
showed us what can be done if everything comes together,"
Henry Reich said. Becky Bessinger '09, who ﬁnished in 67th,
led the women’s cross country team.

The Grinncll men's cross country team is currently ranked
25th in the nation and seven runners are expected to participate
this Saturday. “As a team, the men have not made it [to Na-
tionals] since 1991,” Henry Reich said. “The only times since
[coach Will Freeman] has been here were 1990 and 1991.” At
this point in the season, Reich claims that there isn't much that
can be done to improve. “The only thing we can do is get sick or
injured so we'll try to avoid that," Reich said. “So far so good."

To players on the team, this year's performance was much
different than past years when they were not as successful.
“This is a goal that we’ve had since last year," Montgomery said.
“Grinnell has historically under-performed at regional meets.
we knew that we could do it this year. It_was real good recl-

ing.
