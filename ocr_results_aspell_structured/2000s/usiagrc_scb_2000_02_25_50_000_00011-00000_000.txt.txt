Heavenly Creatures

rauline (Melanie Lynskcy) is a plain, shy i/i.ycar.old
who leads a rather uiieventriil life, attending an allrgirl
parochial school. Things change when
vibrant, haughty Juliet (Kate Winslet,
in her ﬁlm debut), arrives from England.
Opposite in
many ways, they
are iicverthsless

to each other
Through a shared
passion for writ»
ing, they forge an
intense trienda
ship where they depend on each other
tor the magic that is iacieing in thoirstie
iiing surroundings. Together they dream
up an elaborate "fourth world" called
borovriia, a celestial garden populated
by giant butterﬂies, unicorns and me
dieval ltniglits, There they can escape
rrom the biirdcns or homework, hoartr
less teachers, stuiry roommates, doctors

cure lesbianism, and meddling parents
plotting to separate them,

Gradually, their parents begin to susc
post that the two girls have formed an
“iinwholesome anacllmcm " it’s the wholesome 19505,
and the idea orliomoseauality is so horrendous to the
adults, they can barely utter the word. The movie is amr
biguous on this point. The girls are portrayed as insufﬁ—
ciently sophisticatud when it comes to sexuality; they run

Devastated at the thought oriosing each othcr, they
devise a plan that would enable them to stay together

All orthis is told with a rcrvor that is bewitching and
more than a little disturbing, Refusing to be judgmcn»

Director Peter Jackson has
described the film as a murder
story about love, a murder story
with no villains

SCENE

ml, the ﬁlm orrers a moving and unusually comic ac

count orwliat one would assume to be a darlt, gruesome

tale. You cannot help but be captivated by the amazing

chemistry between the girls, their Fierce dcvotion, panic

they tool when Forces beyond their control threaten to
separate them.

This is teen angst at
its most primal level.
Given the right (or
wrong) circumstances,
the fantasy world every
adolsscent creates could
explode into reality. For-

. get unrequited love,
weight issues, acne: the biggest ordcai tcenagcrs race to-
day is alienation, being ostracized, having nobody to turn
to. These issues have been treated in movies like We!—
come t0 t/r! Dull/7mm, but never with such lucidity.

in the media hysteria following the murder, Pauline
and Juliet were dismissed as psychopathic lesbians and
branded as the most evil people on earth, what they had
done seemed so rirbeyond rational explanation. Because
they were under 18, they avoided the death penaltyi
instead, they were detained “at Her Maicstys pleasure,"
an indeterminate sentence, but on the condition that they
never see each other again. Years later, they were released,
and Juliet was found to be prospering in Scotland as a
bust-stlling mystery author using the pon name orAnne
retry—in light ortho events chronicled in the ﬁlm, a
bizarre, ironically appropriate postscript.

Pauline and Julict’s story brings to light the beautirui
motives that can underlie the most heinous crimes: in.
nocence, imagination, obsession, youth, and rebellion,
How irigiitruiiy romantic violence can be. Obsessive love,
when it taltes hold, is not a sweet iiowcry fragrance but a
lethal gas that envelopes and consumes you, until it be,
comes all the airyou breathe, it’s about having one per-
son that yoii’d do anything for and who’d do anything
ror you, and the manic bliss you reel every moment you
spend together.
