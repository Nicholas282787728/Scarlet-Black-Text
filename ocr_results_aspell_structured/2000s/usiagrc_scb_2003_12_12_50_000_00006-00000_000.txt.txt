Admissions recruits student interviewers

By adopting a strategy used at other schools, admissions gives prospective students a chance to talk to seniors, and vice versa

in on short to ease their task of interviewing prospeetive stu
dents, theAdmissions Office hired ﬁve Grinnell seniors at the begins
ning ofthe semester to handle the mayority orontczmpus appoint
ments. The model encourage outtent students to help seleet ruture
elasses through one.on.one interaetion.

Following the use of similar models at
schools such as Carleton and Hamilton colleges
die new system provides protpeetive students
and their paronis with an opportunity to inter
set with an actual student to get a better seitse
of what life a: a Grinnell student is really like,

seniors have spent up to lo hours a week cont
diieting intervieWs.

Oﬁloc, tl'lc ehange appears to have helped aeeommodate the over
loaded schedules ofAdmisslons Ofﬁce staff. “They've just been able
to interview so many more students by having us interview," said
student interviewer Neal Turner '04. The nurnlser orprospeetive stue

diat the student interviewers themselves have had quite busy schedt
ules.

Bath interview is approximately an hour long, providing thirty
minutes for interviewers to ask questions and thirty minutes for the
prospective student or their patents to ask their own questions. After
the interview, each student interviewer writes a two page report about

Aeeording to student interviewer Annie

view, including getting ssense of the stiident's

ties, personality and determining how well
they would fit with Grinncll

For interviewer Laura RiddletFord '04, one ofthc advantages or
having student interviewers has heen that the students being inter-
viewed feel more relaxed and open up more. From what the inter.
viewers ean tell, the parents even like hsving the opportunity to ask a
eurrentstudentwhat lire at Grinnell is really like.

“[The parents] like hearing what I’m going through, why we like
crinnell," said Riddleepotd. "My experienees at Grinnell are not all
positive. If[l] say ‘Loole 1 had s really big paperdue this week, I
didn't even sleep: they get a feel for Grinnell."

But having students ruit the interviews can also mean that the
interview heeomes less formal if the prospeetive student taltes it less

seriously.

“sometimes [the students} get a little too eomrortahle. I've had
questions about the quality of the beer, stiilrlilte that," said Pcrng. At
other points, families have aslted Perng detailed questions about how
to get in. “l’ve hid to draw the line there a few times," she said.
