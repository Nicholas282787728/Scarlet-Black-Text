The new SGA Cabinet plans to reach out to students and bring concerns to col-

lege adminstrators and trustees

By KATIE MCMULLEN

The start of school can mean many new uncertainties for ﬁrst
year students. Without knowledge of the college’s inner workings,
involvement can seem difficult. In this time of insecurity, there are
resources that are a short walk, phone call or mouse click away.

The Student Government Association is one tool for new stu-
dents.

Heading up the SGA this year are President John Bohman '06
and Viceapresident Chris Ochoa ’06. In a recent interview, the two
SGA administrators, who
arrived in Grinnell two
weeks before the rest of the
student body, set out their
goals for the SGA and the
students ot’Grinnell.

The two said they
want to set about crcating
a more approachable feel
for SGA. “We want to be
more connected," states
Bohman when asked about
the year‘s objectives.

Under the leadership
of Bohman and Ochoa,
this year's administration
has set about creating and
maintaining close come
munlcatlons between itself
and students. New this year
is a requirement for sena-
tors to meet with the SAs
of their clusters at least
once a month.The student
leaders said the decision came about with the hope of creating and
maintaining close ties between the needs of the students and the
actions of the senators.

Bohman and Ochoa also hope to maintain another important
aspect of communication improvements by presenting a solid agen-
da. They brainstormed major campus issues, as presented by stu-
dents, and set out speciﬁc goals for the SGA.

“We want people to know what we’re doing," Ochoa said.

which will present an “issue of the week" and provide connict in—
formation.

After their arrival, Bohman and Ochoa immediately began
sifting through and working on several issues throughout the cam—
pus and major isues to address in anticipation of the upcoming
trustee visit.

As the representatives ofthe student body, SGA has always
played a signiﬁcant role in the trustee visit. During these visits
SGA presents student is—
sues to the trustees to en,
sure their voice is heard.
This year Bohman and
Ochoa said they wanted
to “hit it hard" when it
came to presenting stu—
dent concerns to the
Board.

“We want to go in
with a plan and basically
show them that we know
our shit,"stated Bohman.

Along with their
planned presentation,
Bohman and Ochoa hope
to arrange an endowment
spending policy presenta
tion to the students, giVa
ing them the opportunity
to question the trustees
directly and present some
issues themselves.

Bohman and Ochoa
have also started work on several other campus issues. They have
begun reviewing the college alcohol policy, discussing issues of
housing, including the reformation of Cowles into apartments
style housing, deliberating matters of selfrgovernance, tentatively
planning an informational booklet for new snidents with an int
clusive “contract” to selfagovern and dealing with matters of stua
dent groups and facilities, including headquarter placement for the
Stonewall Resource Center.

North Campus smoking

5v EMILIA GARVEV
Since fall 2004 students, both smokers and nonasmokers, have

had to figure out how to respond to the college's new nonssmoking
policy. Limits on where students can and cannot smoke have been
gradually taking effect over the last year. One major point ofconten—

tion is the lack eta promised smelting lounge on North campus.

John Bohman ’06, SGA president, sees it as a problem of selfa
governance,“1ftl\ere isn't a smoking lounge, students will smoke in
their rooms, which is against the rules," Bohman said. “If the sysa
tem doesn't respect them, they won't respect the system." Even aft
ter Cleveland Lounge beeame an official smoking lounge, smoking
lounges has been an ongoing controversy,

Until the lastyear's policy change,Grinnell had designated smok-
ing dorms. In these dorms students could smoke in their rooms and
in some smoking lounges, When tlrc collcgc announccd the new
policy in spring of2003, making adl campus dorms nonsmoking,
many students were upset.

“This was a radical policy shift wuhout a lot of student support,”
said SGA Treasurer Matt Cleinman 06. “Smoking lounges were
planned to appease snidents who were unhappy with the policy”
This lounge plan, he said, has taken a long time to deliver.

The fall semester of 2004 began without
a smoking lounge, and students continued to
smoke indoors. Cleveland Lounge, which had

ers ventilation system was installed.

With 'only one smoking lounge on campus, concerns about the
lack ofa smoking lounge on North campus led several members of
SGA’s Joint Board to pursue possible solutions.

“SGA looked at dorms in the Clangrala area [Clark, Gates,
Rawson and Langan dorms], because it was central to North Cams
pus,” said Bohman. “A lounge in Gates was proposed, but it was on
an all-girls floor. Clark Pit was suggested, but the ventilation would
have had to be [installed] facing the loggia."

Joint Board finally scrrled on Younker Pit Lounge. “With three
doors between it and any dorm room, plus the installation of the

they’re right,” he added,
Other students were frustrated thwarted efforts

to establish a North campus smoking lounge, and student Affairs,
which had not announced the Younker Pit plan in the housing pack-
age, took the blame. “To her credit,Jen Krohn came to Joint Board
and said ‘I messed up. This is my responsibility," said Cleinman.
Krohn is currently out of town on leave and unable to comment.

As the new year begins, North Campus remains without a smoka
ing lounge, and the problem is still being explored. “If people can
come up with something agreeable, we’ll do it,” said Crady.

As for plans to work towards a smoking lounge this year, Bohm»
an is insistent. “This is an issue we've spent enough time on and it
needs to be solved on the administration’s end."
