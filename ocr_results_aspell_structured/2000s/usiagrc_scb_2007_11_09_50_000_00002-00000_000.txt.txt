possibility, crady remarked, “Dealing is going to be dealt with
very harshly liltc it has in the past."

The plan only awaited the approval ofthe
police department before being put into cfs
fect, but Matherly's uneasiness dissuaded the
administration from going ahead with the
plans.

Because both SGA and student staff
had been assured that the policy was all but
a done deal, they were disappointed to hear
that the administration had changed course.
"We're losing out on the potential to handle
things inshousc" said SGA Vice President for Student Affairs
Jan Koszewski '08. "[This policy] would have stood for a fur
ther commitment to selfrgovernance."

With Crady leaving at the end ofthis semester, the chances

or revisiting the in—house drug policy during his term at the
college are slim. “The next vice prcsldcnt can look at it in two

months," Ctady said. “l’m not going to
change it at this point. it could be reviewed
later ant”

Despite the failure to formalize the coin
lege’s policy ofdisposal ofsmall amounts of
marijuana on campus without police notifr
cation, crady noted that the current policy
is still quite liberal, leaving the decision to
call the police to administrators and staff
members.

“We still have discretion about whether or notwe walk past
a room and call the police," he said, “I can think of one case
recently where the police were not involved in a situation Like
that.”

 

from p. 1

According to Eriscoe, security will call the police “when it is a
pretty serious incident, and if the ofﬁcer feels he needs help in
a situation, and if the victim has indicated that they want the
police brought in."

After Security or the police pacify the assailant. the responr
dent from Security ﬁles an incident report. Associate Dean
and Director ofStudent Life Sheree Andrews then receives and
processes these reports as well as defendant and witness states
ments.Thc Grinnell College Hearing Board must then review
the case.

The Grinnell College Hearing Board is comprised of three
administrators that question the defendant, respondent and any
witnesses while investigating the case. From the information
gathered, the Hearing Board then makes a recommendation for
punishment to be reviewed by Dean otstudcnt Affairs Tom
Ctady. '

Since each case is different, there is no set punishment for

an assault, Andrews noted that these recommendations “can
range anywhere from nothing all the way to expulsion It’s
an educational process so we try to match the recommended
sanctions with the policy violations.“

The process is in place to ensure that incidents occur-
ring on campus between members of the college community
are settled. However, students have somewhat more control
over incidents when the police are involvcd. Although Crady
said that “charges are usually ﬁled concurrently on campus and
charges are ﬁled offcampus," students often have some degree
ofdiscretion regarding the prosecution orthose charges.

lfa student docs not want to follow through with legal ac
tion separate trorn thc college. they have the choice to drop the
incident. “The police have been very good over the years about
respecting where students want to go with these things and
not taking it forward if they don’t want to do that,“ remarked
Crady.

Workshop attendees agreed. “This is a really good oppors
tuniry to really bring people together, speciﬁcally girls, for this
and just kind of open up about issues you wouldn't normally
talk about,” said Becca Bernstein ’10.

Love Youl Body Week has focused on issues of Sexuality

”in recent years, but organizers‘ate interested in expanding its‘

scope in the future. “It is open to interpretation. Leaders put
their own ﬂate on it,” said FAC co-leader Anna Friel ’10, who
mentioned that past events have addressed other body-related
issues such as eating disorders.

She and Jones hope to focus on disability awareness in the
future, while Franco wants to continue this year’s trend of di-

versifying the content of the events.

“Maybe next year it someone wanted to lead a non-gen-
dered masturbation workshop, that’s definitely out in the open,"
Franco said.

The enthusiastic response to events shows the continued
importance of Love Your Body week as a forum for students
to talk about body issues and sexuality. “Just the fact that you
can put posters up about masturbation and you can have Loose
Lounge completely ﬁlled really says something,just about peo—
ple’s need to talk about these issues," said Bernstein. “And I
think that in itself explains why Love Your Body Week is so
important."
