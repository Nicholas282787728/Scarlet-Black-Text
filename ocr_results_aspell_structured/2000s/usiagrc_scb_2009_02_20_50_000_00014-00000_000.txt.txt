Bowling scores another strike

BYMICHAEL SCHOELZ

Just a few yards south of campus, still in sight of Bucksbaum
is a resource of great importance and relatarion. it’s not a bar, or
a liquor store—its a bowling alley.

The Bowladrome, with its ten lanes, cozy small town feel
and fan-pleasing animations has been a staple in the Grinnell
community for a long time. Students ﬂock to this invaluable
resource on a weekly basis, whether for recreation or friendly»
competition,

“It’s a great social thing," said Peter
Marsho '12, who frequents the bowling al-
ley.“We just hang out with friends. You get
to make fun of each other and make bets
and since I'm not the best bowler I come
when I can and hope for the best."

on Wednesdays and Fridays students
roll over to the Bowladrome for Bowling
class. The class, which is taught by men’s
soccer and golf coach Brian Jaworski, has
about 22 students that take part in the V;
credit elass. Jaworski took over the class from Andy Hamilton
‘85 only two years ago, but he’s bowled for much of his life.

“My family would go bowling on Thanksgiving night, and
still does,"]aworski said. “Then when I was at DePauw for 12
years, the coaches and I would go bowling on a Friday night, and
because none of us were making any money, people would put
some money in and we would ﬂy and make 10 bucks by beating
out buddies in bowling."

Aside from the class, the Bowladrome plays host to the
Grinncll College Bowling Club.

“My favorite thing about bowling is that it's bin and you can
do it against yourself and other people to keep it competitive,"
said Matt Rosenbaum '12,who is in both the club and the class.

”It’s more popularbetause peop/e
are real/Zing that/1’s a really fun
sport and bow/mg is getting a /or
of publicity on ESPN.”

Matt Rosenbaum ’12

“In the club you go with your friends, but in the class you bowl as
a class and meet new people. But when you're not bowling you’re
just chilling and talking to people aboutbowling."

The bowling club takes place at Bowladrome every Saturday
at 3 p.m.The club, which is run by Johnny Busc '11 (the scars
News Editor) and Jai Garg ’11 (the Sﬂiﬁ's Sports Editor), pres
v-ides free games for all Grinnell College students. The word has
spread, and quickly the club has seen an increase in attendance
this semester, with an average of about 25 students attending

weekly.

“It's more popular because people are re-
alizing that it’s a really fun sport and bowls
ing is getting a lot of publicity on ESPN,"
said Rosenbaum.

The club and the class have been stable
sources of recreation for students during
their tenure here. While most students go
to get away from the hardships of Grinnell,
some go to hone their skills

“1 deﬁnitely take it pretty seriously," said
Andrew Walsh '09, who has been a part ofthe bowling club with
fellow senior Parker Koester '09 since first year. “I’m trying to
get my average up and I’m trying to get more consistent. ‘Cause
sometimes I'll send up a really high score but I have no consis-
tency, so I just got to keep practicing. The fact that I get to play
some free games is pretty nice. And we do the bowling class now,
too. So we bowl three days a week."

Jaworski, who bowls with his students in class, enjoys that the
class allows him to interact with a wide wriety of students.

“My entire day is spent on north campus," Jaworski said.
“And then I get to go to [south] campus and get some more die
velsity. lwould never have met some of these students ifit wasn't
for bowling class."

February 20, 2009

The time between
the Superbowl and
March Madness:
utterly boring!

I have no idea what I'm going to do in February it is
a brutal month. Football is over, baseball hasn't started yet,
and the NBA is dead to me after Al jeffeison’s injury. Sui-e
rhe Wild are in a fight for a playoffhcrth, but most people's
level of excitement for the NHL is about equal to my level
oftolerance for an inconsistent Stlikc zone.

It's sad to think that the most exciting sporting event that
occurred last wtckcnd was pirche and catchers reporting.
Sure it was the NBA’s nilrstnr weekend, but when the best
dunk consists of 12 misses before l’au Gasol ﬁnally learns
how to pass the ball properly, it can hardly be considered a
stirring sports moment.

And what was up with Dwight Howard? How exactly
do you go into a phone boolhi rll NBA sponsored one at
llitlii for 20 seconds and fail to aciunllv put on your cape?
And then, after all ofthar, he only dunked on what up] icaicd
to be an 11 foot hoop T1 in: rccordts a foot higher than that.
It was more theater than anything else, and poorly done the-
atel at that.

I guess there was some semirinteresting news this week,

what with Alex Rodriguez admitting he took performance-
enhancing drugs during his time with the Texas Rangers.
Honestly though, I don't really think it's going to make
much ofa difference as to how people view Rodriguez.

The only reason anyone was rooting for him was because
he is on pace to smash Bonds’ home run record, and We'd
prefer our unlikable superstars to be clean, thank you very
much. His admission wasn't surprising and I didn’t ﬁnd it
particularly disheartening.

The only confession I would find truly crushing were if
Ken Griffey Jr. admitted he had taken some form of per-
formancerenhancing drug. if that happens, 1 say scrap the
whole era and put it on par with the time before baseball was
integrated. Actually, scrap the whole era anyway—asterisks
for everyone.

While the Rodriguez admission and the wild charges he
ﬂung at his accuser were downright silly at times, their ri-
diculousness paled in comparison to what Bud Selig recently
told Neroraneek. According to Selig, he is completely blame-
less when ir comes to the rampant use ofsteroids during his
time as commissioner.

He blames the players and the unions for the problem. I
mean, it’s not like the owners benefited at all from having
beefed-up, home—run slugging superstars popping up left
and right, I’m sure Peter Angelos wasn't thrilled at all when
Brady Anderson hit 50 home runs in 19967more than dou—
ble what he hit in any other year. But apparently it “annoys
the you-now-what" out of Selig when he is criticized for
something hc played a fairly substantial role in.

Maybe l‘m just fortunate to be a Twins fan. During the
explosion of steroid usage in the late-‘90s Minnesota was
pathetic. If there was a single player on the team using
PEDs, they were doing it wrong. Frankly I’m sick and tired
of hearing about who did or did not take steroids.l say ei-
ther steroids for none or steroids for all. But, because there
isn't anything going on now, all we hear about is unfounded
speculation.

Hopefully as reams begin to start their Spring Training
games there will be something else to discuss. Even ifPEDs
continue to be the topic on every baseball writer’s mind,
we’re only a short period oftime away from more interesting
events on other sporting fronts.

The playoffs will start soon for hockey, the NFL Draft
is on the horizon, and the best of them all, March Madness.
will soon be upon us. In short time, 111 be watching so many
“One Shining Moments” and buzzer beaters I‘ll become so
excited that I ll burst like Chris Simms spleen cant wait
