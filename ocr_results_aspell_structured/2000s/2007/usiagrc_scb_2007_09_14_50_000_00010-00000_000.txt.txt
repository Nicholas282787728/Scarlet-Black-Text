Rethink senatorial elections

Every semester, students get what seems
like a hundred e-mails offering them opA
portuniries to meet the senarorial candidates.
And every semester, the candidates come
close to ournumbering the attendees at these
meerrandrgrecrsi Sometimes, the candidates
outnumber attendees two to one. SGA tries
new Ways to attract peopleimeeting multiple
times and dividing meetings by clusteribut
neither turns out the crowds that candidates
and SGA want to see.

Some would argue
that this shows apathy. ’
But maybe we should
consider whether these
meetings are actually
necessary in the first
place. After all, a cou-
ple oftrips to the bath
room should allow most
people to get the information they need. Why
do we need to actually meet candidates? This
is a small community—should anyone want to
meet a candidate, there are a multitude ofways
to get in touch

How much can we actually learn from
spcnding an hour hearing what’s often on a
poster? Even if more smdenrs were to attend
the meet-and-greer, Voters might focus on
personality ﬂaws rather than the more impor-
ranr policy ﬂaws. Awkwardness does not nec-
essarily discount one candidate and charisma
docs not necessarily recommend one. Why
not place greater emphasis on the part of the
election process that acmally educates rhe vor-
ers: the written statements?

Joint Board, for all irs importance, de-
mands pariencc and reliability more than any
other personality traits. Pnsreriug campus and
taking time to write good statements shows

since

more commitment than any quick meet—and—
greet can.

Instead of focusing its efforts on meet-
and-greet events that have little use, SGA
should focus on raising the attendance at
cluster meetings during the semesterr Cluster
meetings are the place for discussion between
senators and Constituents,but are also an evenr
rew constiruents attend. Keep in mind that,
once srudcnrs cast their votes based on posters
hanging on bathroom stalls, they will have a
hundred chances to put a face and a personalr
try With a platform,

Use us shamelessly, please

In case you somehow missed the student
groups tabling outside of the dining hall, be
warned. Caucus season has arrived for us

lucky Iowa residents.
i ~ A, . All those dedicated
itorial supporters of Clinton,
,, Edwards and Obama
' _ are attracting student
‘ _ caucusgoers to their
' candidates.

But according to
the most recent count,
there are J7presi<lenual candidates, And while
Tom “Let’s build a wall” Tancredo probably
isn't any Giinnellian's choice for leader of the
free world,our mucl'rtouted diversity demands
(liveisit’y of political votces. All the silent Joe
Biden fans out there seem to be retreating in

the imposing presence of the Big Three,

Iryou’re having trouble finding other supr
porters for your candidate, we encourage you
to make the 8558's Caucus section your vehicle
for greater visibility on campus. Send us your
event alcits, updates and letters. And check the
Caucus section every two weeks for some of

that famed Grinnell diversify.
Missed moments for collabo

Long before the JRC was even a twinkle in
Tom Cindy’s eye,the name “Rosenﬁeld"cvoked
an aura of campus prestigc The Roscufield
Program, established in 1979, puns symposta

related to public affairs, international relations
and human righrs.

Attendance at Rosenﬁeld events shows
students enjoy the speakers that Rosenfteld
brings to campus, but the program suffers
from a lack of student involvement in plan»
ning and implementation in programs.

Though the Rosent‘icld Advisory Board
includes seven faculty members and seven
students, the board has consistently failed to
include srudenrratrlarge and student groups
in this process, despite the potential for in,
reresring and engaging collaborations. Faculty
groups engage in the process of developing
symposiaia recent collaboration with the
Center for Prairie Studies will raise awareness
of the 2007 Farm Bill in upcoming eventsi
but arrlarge student involvement is lacking,

Lasr semester's Rosenfield symposium
about increasing renewable energy is only one
instance of neglected collaborations. Renew
able energy is one issue that Free the Planet!
(FTP) has eonsrstently supported, yet FTP
was not consulted on potential speakers or
opportunities for coinciding events, With the
participation ofsrudentsrarrlarge, a good symr
posiiim would have been made even better, and
would have given the evenr a more Grinnellian
context.

In another instance, last February the
Progiam hosted a symposium on capital punr
ishmenr and the death penalty, but never ltpr
preached the campus Amnesty International
or Piison writing Workshop groups about
possible involvement. As for upcoming events,
Rosenfield is hosting a celebration of Martin
Luther King JI. later this month. CBS and
other multicultural groups should be included
in these events.

Increased student group involvement with
Rosenfield symposia could only make them
more engaging and interesting for group par—
ticipants and the student body The Rosenfleld
Program exists, ulrimarcly, ro enrich campus
dialogue and student intellectual life. If the
Program continues to miss opportunities to
connect with students, it fails to fulfill these
piiinary missions.
