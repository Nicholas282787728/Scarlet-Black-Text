hive been moved to giving some serious thought to the tunne otstudent government.“ However,
others ntrribured different motivations to Goddnrd's actions. sendtoi Rielt Heilbion suggested,
“People who support the abolition otsrudeiit governmental: those who die ignomnl otits tune
tions nnd those who hreok the rules most otren."

In it letter to the editor in the Slime issiietierri Linn Hart ind Dnvid Dillon nlso q stion the

Snollvmen are people too

Sometime during the night of January 26th,
2007, persons ,unknown destroyed the greats
est snowman that I have ever helped build We
named him Zombie Snowman, and carefully
‘ eratr'ed the contours of his gargantuan body to
in‘spixe dive and terror in all those who looked
upon him Apparently he was 030 terrifying, be
cause on Saturday morning i found him deenpi—

,, med, the tiiins of his body eoveretl by freshly
' fallen snow. My expeetntions had nlrendy been
low- 1 thought heir unite it to Sunday or so
before succumbing to either gravity or drunken
idiots- but come on, not even one night!? I don't
, eere hovv wnsteri you were, but destroying snow—
: mén, like bashing‘ in windows and doors or even
walking down the loggia and tearing down post-
