Aren’t they too old to trick-or-treat‘?

The Mayhem Brothers take a look back at the kindestseason of all: Halloween

Tim-1 think that Halloween is one or the under apprc-
ciated holidays in our culture. Too

bad it s over.

Mike: Yeahl agree. It’s a great
way for adults to recall and connect
with the magic of youth.

Wyatt: And its a gieat time foi
scaring the living hell out oi‘ every
one under the ago of 10.

Tim: I think that Halloween
has become too much about candy. though. We are losing the
history or the holiday For instance, ditl you know that it was
originally celebrated as Satan's birthday.>

Mike: I don't think that's true at all.

Tirn: Ycah. you're right. I made that up.
But you have to admit it would be cool ifwe
all just inadvertantly celebrated the birth of
our Dark Lord, Lucifer.

Wyatt: Oh,Lucifer.I thougbtyou mcant
Dick Williams.

Mike: You shouldn’t say that. Dick Wil-
liams hasn’t done anything to you. Leave the
poor man alone.

Wyatt: I'll leave Dick Williams alone as soon as he leaves
all those chickens alone.

Mike and Tim: What.>

Wyatt: Never mind. Can we stop picking up this mess and
go eat Mike’s candy?

Tim: Sure.

Mike: No!

Tim: I really hate it when people give out granola bars or
raisins, or even worse, toothbrushes instead of candy. I have a
list of houses to burn down now.

Mike: I can’t believe how much candy you both got. I don't
think it’s acceptable for people past puberty to go tnck’or’
treating.

Wyatt: We didn't have to go house to house.Think about it,
Mike. Pro-pubescent kids arc the only ones who get candy, and
conveniently, they are unable to defend themselves. Therefore I
wound up with lots otcandy

Tim- You wont get any candy ifyou dont have an awesome
costume though. Youd better come up with a better costume
for next year, Mike.

Mike: I-[mm
that

Tim: Just stop right there, Mike

Wyatt:That might be the worst costume ever.

Mike: And I suppose you can come up with a better idea?‘

WyattThat’s right. Big Bird. -

1 do have this cool Raggedy Andy costume

We are losing the history of the
holiday For instants, did you
know that ii was originally te/t
ehraled as Satan’s birthday?
—Tim Billion ’08

Tim: Thais as bad is Mikes idea!

Wyatt. You didnt let me finish lrn picturing a deranged
mutant Big Bird, with an axe in one hand ind a scycrcd head in
the other. That's the stuffofnightmarcs!

Tim: Well, I think I‘ve got you both heart saw someone
going this year as a poor person

. Mike that’s not scary, that’s

Mikel/linen ’09

Tim: What (lo you mean. “that s
not scary?" He probably had a ucl—
fiirc check and another kid on the
way, nor to mention the iilsling on
parts on lns lawn. Now that's tcrr
iifvmol
Mike You to going to hcll
Wyatt: You mean Dick Williams' house> Why would he
go there.>1 don't think he's giving out candy
anymore.

Mike: Honestly, Wyatt,1 have no idca
why you keep making such dumb jokes
about Dick Williams. Have you even met
the man.> What could he possibly have done
to make you hate him?

Wyatt: Other than embezzle my tuition
money while hiding it behind absurdly high
dining prices? Just kidding, he never did
anything to me, but I don‘t need a reason to
mock him. Get used to the Dick Williams jokes, Mike.They’te
just beginning.

Mike: Let me get this straight. Halloween for you two
consisted ofviolencc against children. mockery orpoyerty and
slander ora good man. So explain to me again how you’re both
not going to licll.>

Tim and Wyatt: Shut up, Mike,

Theory flaps in practice

I’m all for the playing of KDIC in the Grille
and dining hall. It’s great that the administration
is cavingtostudentwautsandlettingGrinnellians
express their unique and varied musical tastes
in theory In actuality, KDIC DJs like some
weird-ass music. No: weird as in quirky, weird
as in annoying. liyou like noisc or death metal,
that’s great for you. But when I’m trying to do
work in the Grille or have a pleasant conversa»
Lion its more than a little distracting. I'm not
trying to he a music such, because God knows I
like some crappy music, burl think theres a dis-
tinction between playing “Lip Gloss"and playing
static for two minutes straight. My issue is not
with the DJs, but, as a good Gi-inncllian, with
the administrators that allow it to be played. Put
your foot down.

300! Is it ghostly or ghastly?

While I appreciate that Harris party organiz-
ers are near-saints for their efforts, Halloween
Harris showed that even saints make mistakes.
WHERETHE HELLVVASTI‘IE CATVVALK?
AND WHY DID THE WHOLE COSTUMEs
COMPETITION END ABRUPTLY? Come
on guys.1knowyou put in alot otwork,but how
much morc errort would it have been to drag the
platforms into a long line? The costume contest
is the reason many of us go—andy et itjust kind
or died out or apathy from the MC. So while I
thank you ior your Worl(,I hope next year or
gnnizers will remember how many ghosts and
ghouls )ust want to strut their stuff.

A digital demi—disaster

1 really appreciate the work oi Grinnell ﬁlms in
providing enjowble movies to watch on weekends. I
particularly appreciate DVD movies, because when
i show up 1 know that the ﬁlm will run without any
technical difﬁculties. But one aspect of DVD mov-
ies in Harris isn‘t so enjoyable After 7:30 showings
of those movies end, the movie returns to the title
screen and loops, greeting early arrivals to 10:30
showings with endlessly repeating music and sound
effects. At best, this is annoying. At worst—Like last
Saturday's 28 Week: Lam—the result is a ceaseless
loop ofscrtams, pounding music and zombie sound
eilccrs, rendering conversation or quiet thought
impossible. Yay ﬁlms,yay DVDs, but can you please
make it possible to be in the cinema prior to a tilm
withoutgoing insane?
