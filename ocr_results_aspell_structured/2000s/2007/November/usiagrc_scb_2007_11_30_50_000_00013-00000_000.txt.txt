Rebel, sometimes
with a cause

Q Add yNajera’lO

What comes to mind when I think ofn naval piercing is 11
hot surfer girl, 1 hadass hiker; someone who spits in the race
otaurhority. Unfortunately, as I write this I am picking on the
crust that has formed around my new belly-button ring and
wrp1ng out the lint that his aeeurnulrtred. This is neither hot
nor badass.

I hope that as it hcnls, it will hegin to rrnnsrorm me. I have
my doubts, though, hecnuse I tried this before when I got my
nose pierced. At ﬁrst, mv 111st-Co1st all- -girls hoarding school
eons1dered me 11 rebel. Theie was gossip 11s to ifa nose ring was
even allowed at school, the cafeteria ladv told me it looked disr
respectful and freshmen came up to me and told me I was cool.
I was living the dream as I let them believe that I didn't care
wlr1t anyone thought or me. My father also took this to mean
thnt I was now 1 1ehel: driving over the speed limit, buying
crack in the ghettos of Connecticut and having sex with men I
met on the streets.

I was h1ppy to let him th1nk thnt. hut 11 just wasn't true. I
will admit I were dark eyeliner,I might have worn 11 wristband
or two and yes,1 own a pair or hlack Converse AlleStars. But
these accessories did not create the image I wanted; the image
that would could some litrle children, intimidate my peers 111d
rn1ke parents wonder tfl ms 1 good inﬂuence.

In h1gh school, I we umque and res, that 1s code forweird.
I w1s 1 Fmdiaii Ifit wasn't a term before, it is now (111:1:an
dian 1\lypi61'cing\v\s a sntcmcnl’ oi cultural 1el11titrtv rather
than one ofdisrespect oftmditional authority I wanted to show
how whnt is seen as rehellion here is actually commonplace in
celtain places in Ind11

To get my nose pie 111g, I stepped into the tntroo p11lor
wearing 1111' Snlrvaar top and my halt in a long, dark hrrud down
my back, was only 17, so my mother 111d to slgn some fcums,
show them my hir1h certiﬁcate and hold my hand while it hap—
pened Itwas badass When I stepped outwith a shiny ncwring
on my face, all I could think was, ”Tl \ank God, I didnt cry .

When l went to the Gtinnell tattoo parlanl had no Ull’
tural reierence or clever explanation to give. I was hored andl
needed 1 new accessorthe nrst personl told the next day was
my soeyeareold grandmother, she said it sounded cute.

I always knew i wasn't hadass 111 high school, but it w1s so
much easier [0 pretend there.What wouldn't cause an uproar at
an all-girls honrding school.>The guy who pierced me 1n town
had the usual tutroo-covered arms, pierced 111cc, and surface
piercings covering his hands. That's to he expected at a tattoo
parlor. hut he wasn't badass either. When he wasn't piercing
college students- navels he g motivational speeches to high
schools and spem time with re.

I guess 111 just settle for hung out girl who 1111s 11 couple
piercings, but who' 1s mostly rriendlv and 1 hrrlc weird I an
accept the fact 11111 I am not intimidating, hut somer I

In the club, late

Cont. from pg. 12
has strong ties to media groupswe hope 11 will begin to tie
the groups together as well.

Students really want to work late

Students who headed to ARH on Sunday to catch up
on homework ran into an obstacle ARH was locked

We undeistand that the holidays might complicate
keeping ARI-I open. But this is just one case ofa broader
concern, lVIany or’ the collcge's academic buildings close
down home before the average student goes to bed.

This is frustrating since there’s an easy solution: P-
cards. Noyce has 24el1our Pecard access, and students take
full advantage of this. Bucksbaum and ARH both have
readers on their doors, but student P-cnrds don’t work afr
ter hours.

The administration should use existing infrastructure
to give students access to major academic buildings during
what is, for many, the most productive part of the day.
