Don’t forget
a Grinnellian

Yuki Goto was in a car accident with three
other Grinnellians on Fcb. 26, 2006,

It still doesn't seem so long ago tome when
every week virki was on the front page of the
scab, when I rvould visit the hospital, when
people who didn’t know Yliki,]elal Venues ’08,
Liza Coburn ’09 or Demetrio Rojas ’08 were
writing them get well notes, when a pa ltetl
counseling session was held in thc Forum
South Lounge,

Ycars oftecovery is nowhere near as sensa-
tional as Obaina, Clinton or a car that ﬂips five
times, but now is a time when we can actually
help Yuki.

Yukr is doing great. He came and visited
for the first time since the accident right bcs
foreThanksgiving. Since he started rehabilita—
tion a: the Rusk Institute he has made incred-
ible progress.

Unfortunately, Yuki and his family are not
doing so well financially. The insurance money
has run out and the Rusk Institute costs over
350,000 a semester.

Here is how you can help:

Yuki was accepted by the Traumatic Brain
Injury Recovery Drive (TrBird) Foundation.
Please give tax-deductible donations to Yuki
Goto through this foundation. These dona—
tions will help to pay for Yuki's tuition at the
Rusk Institute

Take the time to talk to your parents about
his situation, and make sure to note that you
intend for your donation (0 go to Yuki Com,

1 refuse to believe that a community that
was so devastated in the aftermath of the ace
cident will now fail to help Yuki and his family
when they need us.

Please be a part ofrhe healing process. Tr
Bird’s website is http://trbirdfoundatronorg.

Speaking up,
paying out

This semester, there has been campus-wide
discussion about how students, speciﬁcally the
SGA cabinet, are compensated, As it draws to
a close, we want to help summarize the pro
cess to ensure that we continue to be open and
honest with everyone.

The discussion about salaried student PDSI‘
tions began when the college's benefits pack-
ages were audited by the le. since benefits
packages are closely linked to wage structures,
the College Treasurer’s office felt that this
was an appropriate
time to ex. ire slur
dcnt compensation to
make surc the college
is fully compliant with
tax code, including the
Fair Labor Standards
Act,

The Act stipulates
that salaried workers
cannot be paid less
than the equivalent ofiniirimum wage for the
number of hours they work. SGA comprises
one octhe two major groups ofsalaried student
positions (SPARC is the other), and cabinet
stipends currently fall short of these terms,

We recognize that this it a significant
increase in cabinet pay, but we believe
Ibursucli an Increase is fair based on the
amount oflime cabinet positions require,
iBrad Bishop ’08

SGA cabinet positions have been paid for
a number of years, and the student body has
approved these salaries thlough their represent
tatives atjoint Board at the beginning ofeaeh
semester. salaries are needed to compensate
officers for their timcrconsulning responsi-
brlities, Thc salaries winch werc originally set,
however, have not been increased to account
for raises in the minimum wage ol the ilddr
tion of duties to cabin
net positions,

This fall, the Cole
lege Treasurer's Oihce
asked cabinet to chart
the number of hours
eacir member spent
per week on scar
related activities, We
collectively worked to
distinguish between
“corc administrative duties” for a minimally
functional cabinet and the additional voluntary
activities we take part in to do ourjob well.

Realistically, each officer has to spend 15
hours per week to complete the basic, constit
tutionallyrrequired duties. After investigating
manyother avenuesforcomperisation.the Colt
legs Treasurer’s office calculated a new stipend
based on the college's wage scale, to be funded
through an rise in the Student Activities Fund,
averaging SlSOO/semester for each officer, rip
from the previous average oralzso.

We recognize that this is a significant irr
crease in cabinet pay, but we believe that such
an increase is fair based on the amount oftimc
cabinet positions require. Our intent was never
to unilaterally increase our own pay—our goals
are to be honest about our work, responsible in
managing the student body’s funds, and estab-
lish equitable pay for future ofﬁcers.

We’ve tried our best to be open throughout
this entire process, Whlch has been discussed
inJoint Board throughout the semester. We've
listened to all questions, responded to requests
for information, held open forums, etc, and
your input has been very helpful

lfyou have additional questions, comments
or want to talk [0 us, please let us know, and
check out the additional information posted
on unvwgrinnellsgacom. All our office hours
are posted in the SGA ofﬁces and if those
don't work for you, e—mail any of us and we’d
be more than happy to meet.

Thank you all for your input, support and
time, and please keep helping us serve you.

He’s bringing
debate back

Over a year ago, in the midst of midrtcrm
elections, the now defunct student Campaign
for Increased Political
Engagement (SCIPE)
hosted a debate bet
tween the tltirdjiiirtv
candidates for Iowa
governor. SCIPE was
thecainpus'nirrlti-par-
tisan group wirlr the
stated goal ot'drarving
from a wide range of
views to facilitate ptr
litlcal discourse. This debate was one ofmauy
the group hosted, And it was intriguing.

As I recall, thcrc was little clash between
the Socialist Worket candidate and the Green
candldatc,but the Libertarian challenged both

ofrhem as well as the audience. lt was,m some
ways, more entertaining than watching any
single candidate give a stump speech,

Yet no more than is people showed up7
including the mcmbcrs of SCIPE and thc
candidates themselves.

In certain respects, Gtiirnell seems to lack
a vibrant and civil political culture. Yes,I know

prove this. What I’m
talking about is a
disintelest in multi-
partrsau political car
pressron and negative,
cowardly attacks that
fail to even intclli»
gently engage the in-
tended audience.

Consider the mysterious “Grinncll college
Students forTruth”poster as well as recent act
cusations ofposter removal, I find it ridiculous
that any cadre of students would go around
proclaiming they know the “truth" and that it’s
simple enough to fit on a standard Srbyrllr
inch poster.

I have faith that Grinnellians are, in gen-
eral, smart enough to see past a rudimen-
tary table dividing candidates on the issue of
universal healthcare, especially one that puts
Baraek Obama in the same league as Repubr
licans, Look. I'll be the first to tcll you that I
Iovc to see the big national debates play out at
a local level. But not when they translate into
anonymous attacks.

The fact that posters for Joe Biden‘s event
were torn down disturbs me. The same thing
happened at last year's SCIPE event, 1 have
no idea who took Biden’s posters down and I
do not assume that it was an order from any
student group, Still, it shows a large amount
of disrespect on thc part of at least a few in-
dividuals Equally disturbing is a new poster
condemning the students for Obaina group
for tearing down posters of other campaigns.
Isn't there a better way to be pissed than put-
ting up yet another anonymous poster?

1 propose an open forum next week for
all interested parties to vent their frustration
and to discuss the issues at handisolutions to
healthcare, climate ehange, etc. I'm surprised
this hasn’t happened before since it’s a much
better way to create “awareness" than a lousy
posters

As a currently undecided caucusrgoer, 1
would be more than glad to moderate such a
forum. Please let me know, I would also love
to see the return ofSClPE, a group that drew
both criticism and praise on campus, or some-
thing similar,

I think that such a forum and the rebirth
of SCIPE could be the first steps in strength
euing our political culture. Such steps will be
critical in creating a political culture that am
phasizes respect and promotes the cxprcssion
and critical analysis
of divergent viciw

Given all the arronyr
inous attacks, it's a
relief that at the up
coming caucuses we'll
have the enormous
opportunity (respon-
sibility) to negotiate all of our concerns with
each other, face to face.

Let this debacle serve as a reminder to
all those who dare question the merits of the
caucus system (whether or not Iowa should be

If in need,
get advocate

Sexual assault and intimate partner vior
lence are always hot topics on a college came
pus, but I would venture to say that we. r r
campus, currently have reason to be more cone
ccrned than usual. It is reasonable to be very
disturbed, even personally distraught, about
potential date rape drugs and assault more
broadly on campus.

Although we need not walk around in fear,
sexual assault is an issue we should be aware of
on campus. Approximately one in four college
women will be sexually assaulted during dreir
educational career. Statistically, women are at
greatest risk of sexual assault during their first
three months on campus.

Ofeourse, women are not the only victims
ofsexual assault and intimate partner violence,
Most statistics state that 10 percent ofall sew,
a1 assault victims are male, but there is a strong
possibility that male assault is even more un—
detrepotted than violence againstwomenl’er
haps as disturbing is the fact that 42 percent of
college women who are raped tell no one about
their assault and this number is likely much
higher for nrale victims/survivors.

The campus community should know that
there art: services available, and people there
just to listen, both on and ofrcampus. in terms
of on-campus services, the Chaplain, the Rabt
hi and mental health counselors are the Corns
pletely confidential services on campus,

Outside the Grinnell College bubble. any
one can contact DVA/SAC, a HDDTPKOGI ad-
vocacy agency that offers services and support
to victims and survivors of intimate partner
Violence and sexual assault. An advocate is
someone trained to deal with sexual assault/int
tiinate partner violence.They are there to offer
unconditional support, empower victims/sort
vivors and aid in the healing process.

Please know that all ofDVA/SAC services
are free, completely confidential and without
expectation. DVA/SAC,which has an office in
Grinnell, offers a number ofservices including
a crisis line which is staffed 24rhours a day.

in addition to these services, you may
have heard of the campus advocates program.
Campus advocates are trained Grinnell Col-
lege students who work with DVA/SAC as
advocates, You can reach campus advocates
by calling the DVA/SAC hotline, which is
17800777973512 or,
on campus, by calling
x4440,

Either of these
numbers will call
DVA/SAC directly at
which point you may
request a student ads
vocate rfyou so choose,
You can also speak to a
nonrcollcgc aifiliuted
advocate,

If you or someone you know has been af-
fected by intimate partner violence or sevual
assault, know that these services ale available.
