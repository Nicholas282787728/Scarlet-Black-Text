On Assignment
Continued from p. 5

after they learned that Paramount wanted to
charge them over 340,000 to put up a bronze
bust of James Kirk.

We parked the Car on the side orthe road,
in from of rhe quaint downtown area and got
out, ready to take pictures, see the sights, and
meet the people whose loins would ultimately
create the man who would begin it all. Notable
among the run-down buildings, empty store
fronts. and closed souvenir stores was Senior
Dining, an eatery sporting a sign proclaiming
that all visitors should "Come in and eat with
the ancestors.” Twenty feet down the street,
we found the object ofour quest.Thei‘e above
us, William Shatncr stood happily on a sign,
smiling but managing to look serious, an arrow
pointing to an alley between a beauty salon and
a usedrclothing store, Presumably, sometime
in the next 200 years, these Will be knocked
down to build the Kirk farmhouse

Reverently, we stepped through the snow
and saw before us a concrete monument to a
man whose good deeds are known, but will not
be committed or realized until the distant fu—
turc. lrs stony surtaee rose from the snow, the
black and red letters carved' into its surface as
titillating as they were matter of fact. It was
neatly holy experience 1 posed with the mont
uinent. My friends Christine McCormick' 09
and Anna Werner '09 joined me in performing
a historical pre-enactmcnt of the scene that
would occur on the very spot 221 years in the
future. Anna sat in the snow, her legs spread
while Christine pretended to be that ohrso-
famous Kirk child and I held her, obviously the
father and the OBGYN, I think it is impor
tant to note that, though the monument says
“March 22, 2228”, the Star Trek website lists
Kirk's birth year as 2233.

My wonderment of the birthplace faded
quickly We walked back out toward the car,

but stepping out into the sunlight at the end
of the alley, were distracted by the used-cloth-
ing store, Vintage Ville. The owner gleeted
us at the door and we slowly wove our way
about the store, trying on some alarmingly
inexpensive wigs. The only two pieces of Star
Tue/e memorabilia available for purchase were
a CD with bloopers oftlie original series and
a set of “Shat Hats“ (green, yellow and red
felt berets pioneered during an ill-fated real-
ity show staring Willian Shatner). These were
tempting, but ultimately we passed them by
and instead purchased a Ninja Turtles cake
pan. I felt a twinge of guilt, forgoing Star Trek
fanaticism in favor of a cake pan, but it was
shaped like Michelangelo and i don‘t think
I could ever bring myself to wear something
called a “Shat” on my head.

waTrck fans will be saddened to learn
that Riverside has a distinct lack ofreplicarors,
forcmg us to purchase food at Murphy's, the
local bar and tavern. After much discussion
and prodding, Anna asked the bartender a
question. “Excuse me, but we lemcmber hear-
ing about some sort of... plaque... commemo-
rating James Kirk's point oteoneeption." She
laughed and told us that it was in the bar. In
earlier years, the plaque had been beneath the
pool table, causing quite a ruckus when a tour
ist wanted to take a picture of it; now, it was
mounted on the wall beside the pool table.
After photographing the plaque (and doing a
tango that culminated in a dip which we nerds
decided was as close to a historical prercnactr
merit ofthe conception as we would venture),
we ate our food and pondered the future of
the megaverse. Then we put in Running with
scissors and sang along to Weird Al. As we
pulled onto Highvmy 218, we couldn’t help
turning back and saying to the small lowan
town, in the immortal words of Dr. Spock,
“Live long and prosper."
