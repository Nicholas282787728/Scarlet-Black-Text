While Grinnell may provide for nearly
every student‘s needs, brain imaging isn‘t one
of them, Thar didn‘t stop Pavirra Kannan,
though. once she graduates, she will depart
for Betliesda,MD.where she will ngin Wolk’
ing in :1 National Institute of Health (NIH)
molecular imi g lab, researching mental
disorders like sc oplircnia, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.

A Chemistiy/French double major, Kane
nan has pursued research positions for the
past three summers. VVhlle her passion for
chemistry emerged early, it rook a semester
abroad in Nantes for Kannan
to decide she also wanted to
major in French. Although
she admitted modestly: “I
have no clue how I decided to
connect those two," the prose
peer of eventually doing research in France
interests hei.

Applying for the job was a timesconsums
ing and stressful venture for Kannan, but
ultimately worth it. She began the applica-
tion piocess in October and had to wait until
March for confirmation Along with the ap-
plication staplcs ofa resume and cover letter,
she also had to do extensive followup work to
make suie her application was not misplaced.
Simply ensuring that her information was
submitted to the Institutes darahase required
numerous contacts and a ﬂight to interview at

the lab, which she paid for. “It's a long pio-
cess,”she said. “But I’m happy."

The end product of that application
process is almost as complex. Her research
will involve the chemistry of brain imaging,
which, in layman’s terms, means she will study
images of particular hrain receptors that are
responsible for mental disorders. Kannan
will be examining these molecules in order to
better understand the root causes of diseases
like Parkinson’s and help with the search for
a cure,

Kannan credits the Grinnell science divi-
sion for providing ample prept
aration to do research work.
Ultimately, though; she said
it was her close relationships
with professors here that toss
rered her achievement and also
developed her interpersonal skills .

Shy when she first came to Grinnell, her
work with professors now allows her to feel
more at ease around people she doesn't know,
which she said helped immensely during
the interview process: “Just overcoming my
timidness when 1 came here, opening u to
people, and being able to ask questions was
very importanr1," she said.

Are there any words ofwisdom that this
soontmtbe NIH researcher has to share? “Go
for the crazy jobs," she recommended. “They
can be a lot offun."

there will be similar to Grinnell.

Long said that he came to Grinnell knowing
that he wanted to go to law school. A summer
internship with the ACLU in Lincoln, Nebraska
was a “great way to solidify what I wanted to do,”
working with a Grinnell alumnus, he loved the
office environment But the internship also made

him ienlize that ii full~time job {0' the ACLU

wasn't what he wanted to do with his life. No

pro bono work for the ACLU and other public interest groups.

Long is a philosophy .n or, and his favorite class, Ancient Phi-

an experience which Long described as "my
best academic experience herhintense, fast
‘ and furious."

Another one ofLong’s fnvorite Grinnell
memories is his time on the golf team, par-
o‘: tieularly their spring break trips to Arizona.

0n break this year, Long says the team met

the son ofan alumnus who invited the team
to play and have dinner at his country club.

The experience exemplifies what Long loved

about his time on the golf Courseﬂppot-

tunities to travel and have tan with a “great
. group of people I probably wouldn’t have
otherwise been friends with."

During his time at Grinnell Long also
found time to be a student staff member for
two years, setve on the Philosophy SEFC
and work in the admissions oﬂiee. And he
spent a summer as a fulletime tour guide in
Grinnell, which he described :is a “long, hot
summer."

Long struggled to thin or advice for
current students that “wasn’t trite, like ‘en-
