War Protest
from p. 1

tion in a similar protest last week.
On Monday morning, these stu-
dents and Gaunt walked into Senator
Chuck Gmssiey‘s (RcIA) office and
began to read the names ofAmcrienn
and Iraqi casualties in the current war.
They also gave a petition to the em-
ploycc in charge of
the senator's of:
flee in Grusslcy's
absence, Bob Re-
naud. The pcti—
tion denounced
the continued
participation in
thc Iraq war and
any increases in the wars financing,
signed by 351 Grinncllians.
According to Perhix, Renaud then
asked them to leave, which they did
not. Renaud called the police, who
made the same request, and then at-
rcstud Gaunt,Aylingand Pcrbixwhen
they refused to leave. The three were
taken tojail at about 3:30 on Monday
and released at noon on Tuesday.
Ayling, who has a childhood
friend currently serving in Iraq, said
that ”the absolute worst thing we can
do is escalate [our involvement in the
ward." She did not expect Grassley to
change his support of the appropriae
(ions bill, but believes ”as part of the
national movement, we will hclp pcr-
suade those Congrcsspcoplc on dis

”What we are doing in iraq i5
tomp/ele/y immoral and a grass
violation of human rights.”

cdgc of this issue."

Pcrbix said he participated in the
protest because of “a deep personal
conviction that no war is just, What
wc are doing in Iraq is complcrcly imr
moral and :1 gross violation of human
rights.” .

While Pcrbix is uncertain of the
effectiveness of his actions, he be—

' lieves that by creating
a politiclil climate of
unrest, opposition to
the status quo will
become accepted and
thuro will be hope
for curling, in his
words, “this unjust
war. [Protesting it] is
something that needs

to be done."

The protest “ms organized with
several other Grinnellians, includ-
ing Latona Giwa ’09, Nick Moulton
'07 and Nora Coon Y10. The students
went doorvtovdoor collecting for a
'legal fund’ which will help pay for
3300 dollars of the total cost in ﬁnes
and will be split between Perbix and
Ayling.

Also in conjunction wirh The Oc-
cupation Project, Emily Stiever ’09
and other students are organizing a
legal protest todayin Des Moines.

Voicebox
from p. 2
was hclptul in improving thc ccurcr's organiziriou,

Dcspltt the optimism surrounding us opcmng, the
Voicchor has raccd challcngcs in ilcquiring rcsourccs
and huild g srudcnr involvement, Though thcrc was
high participation caily last seineslci, the numbei of
actnc mcmbcrs has since dwindled. According ro
leu, one ofthc greatest difﬁculties ising award
ncss, “i think the most dimrnll part is getting people
to know about the Voicebox and know what it can do
for pcoplc,"shc said.

A part of its effort to increase awareness of its
activities, the Voicebox is still building its lelationsliip
with multicultural groups, most or which havc suites
om: flool bclow. “[In rhcl multicultural suites some
pcoplc have on that lthc Voicebox] is too dctachcd
from thc rest of Cainpus,"said Melina Rivera ’07, co
leader of the Student Oigamzation of Latinos/Lati-
nas (SOL).

Some students who have used the center felt that
it could improvc some ofits crtorts, Emily Kugisnkj

’0‘}, carlclldcr of Free The Planet (FTP). which uses
thc Voicebox frequently, said that While the Voicebox
has incrcr std dialogue between groups, it is somewhat
disorganized and could do more to connect student
organizations.

Gina said that thc Voiccbor is trying to cmulatc
somc ofthc lmllticultulltl groups to improvc thcir own
organization. “They have a really efﬁcient way of get
ting things donc,”shc said. “I rccl like rhcy havc a lot
ro nt’tcr ro rhc rcst orihc campus C0ihi“\lnlly,1lf\d thc
Voicebox can help other groups follow thcir trample."
According to leaders from both SOL and the Voices
box, thc rwo groups wcrc ablc to effectively coaldllialc
last scmcstei to organize a protest against the School
of the Aineiicas and advance the Coke boycott.

Heidi Conner ’09, coelcndcr of FTP feels most
issues will be addrcsscd and is optimistic about the
futurc. “I‘m very thankful that we have it," she said.
“And I’m sure as umc progresses, things will mcld
together better and maybc students will take better
advantage ofit."

 

Election

tended to vote for both Spie-

fVOm P- 7 gcl and Bone-Rundlc but that he

“ .. d i d n ’ t know how to spell their names
idn’t want to waste a vote."

Julic Edwards ’07 said that it is solely thc respone
sibility ofthe candidate to compensate their write—in
status by incieasing their name recognition. “Ifyou’te
going to be a write-in, you‘ve got to get your name
out,"shc said.Whilc winning as a writcVin is difﬁcult,
Edwards said it is not impossible. "[SGA Senator]
Harry Krejsa ran a great Write’in campaign and got
elected last semester and he deﬁnitely has an interest-
ing last namc,"shc said.

spicgcl and Boric-Rundlc, who made the mutual

dccision to run, said that while thcir dccision to apply.

late stemmed partly from poor communication be
tween themselves, the main factor was a lack of con-
fidence in the other candidates. “We didn’t feel like
they would address what wc wantcd,"said Spicgcl.

Dcspitc rhcir poor showing, ncithcr Spicgcl nor
BOHC’RllndlC, nor any ofthc other candidates, could
be accused of running invisible campaigns. “This
ycar, wt must have scr somc sort orrccord for killing
trccs," Billups said,

Candidates posted fliers, distributed postcards,
and presidential hopeful Howard Krohn’OS even held
a kcgger clccrion night. Most had assembled ad-hoc
commitrccs among rhcir friends to dircct rhcir efforts.
Official candidates also participated in two forums
dcsigncd to facilitate candidateevoter interaction.

The cxtcnsivc campaigning helped, along with
initiative voting, to increase voter turnout. According
ro Edwards, voting rcachcd the necessary so ptrccnr
quorum hours sooner than last scmcsrcr's vote, 963
students, or 64 percent participated in the election.

Despite the relatively high turnout, students in-
tcrvicwcd said rhcy srill vicwcd SGA as a relatively
insular body and felt rcmovcd from irs proceedings.
“1 think a lot of people don’t know who’s on SGA,"
said Jamie Alper ’09. “It’s just a group ofpcople who
are identiﬁed as a unit. It’s not like anyonc’s ever mak-
ing any real changes."

Bridging rhc gap between rhc student body and
SGA will Fall to next year's Cabinet members includ
ing President-elect lVlegnn Goering and Vice Presir
