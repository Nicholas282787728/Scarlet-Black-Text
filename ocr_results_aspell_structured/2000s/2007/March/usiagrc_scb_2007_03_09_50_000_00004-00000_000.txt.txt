Ever week, 30 Grinnell College students go to rison. In groups of
twos and t tees, they drive the 20 minutes from Grinne to the Newton Cor—
rectional Facility, put on pink “guest” badges, run their belongings through
an X—ray scanner, walk through a metal detector and make their way through
three heavy metal doors and a gate topped with razor wire.

Finally, they get to the prisons library. Once there, they sit
at a table with a class full of prisoners.They teach everything
from evolution to playwriting. This semester, the program hit
an all-time high 0(30 Gtinnellian teachers.

I'm one ofthose teachers, Last summer,I spent four aftert
noons a week teaching poetry and fiction classes at the prison.
One day, I had a conveisation with my students that made me
wonder who was really getting the education.

"You ever heard of‘shooting jiggers?"’Andy asked. Our po»
erry class was over, but Andy and Jordan hadn't left yet.

“No,"I replied.

“That's when somebody asks you to look out for guards for
them,” said Jordan. “Like if I muted to smoke inside my cell, 1
could ask Andy to shoorjiggers for me."

“They had it worked out at Anamosa," said Andy. Most
of my students have done time in Anamosa, IA, a maximum
security state penitentiary, before coming to the medium se-
curity Newton Correctional Facility. Inmates, Jordan told me,
call Newton “Camp cupcake." It’s one of the last prisons Iowa
inmates go to. (“This is a going home prison," Daniel, anotl-r
er one of my students, explains. “Funny thing I’m not going
home")

“At Anamosa, if there was a co [correctional omcer] com-
ing, you could hear people yelling so. so all the way down
the tier," Andy went on. “By the time the guard came, you
would have ﬂushed your cigarette.“

“That’s a differ-
ent place,”said Jordan. H , _ .
“Something about have You everheard of shooting/lye
"‘3 5°d§°°"“‘“ “(“115 gets?”’/lndyaskezi ”Na,”/rep/led
surroun ing you gives
you a different kind or
mentality." No walls
surround the Newton prison rjust fences and razor wire.

“I saw the most ingenious things at Anamosa,” said Andy.
“Guys in lockup could pass things from cell to cell no problem.
Even in solitary. You pushed things out from under the bars,
and the guy next to you would throw out a string with a finer
toothed comb on the end and drag it back.”

“People used a string to dangle things two or three tiers
below thena,”jordan said.

“Really?" I asked.

“You had to be quiclc" he said.

Inmates played chess between cells, too, said Andy. They
crafted boards from scraps of paper and used toothpaste to
sculpt chess pieces our of toilet paper. They caned “rook to Be
6" from one cell to another.

It was almost four, just before prison roll call, so I began
gathering my papers. joidan left the library, saying he would
see the Wednesday. Andy and I walked to the front or the lit
braty, where James, who I’d had in class before, was finishing
up some paperwork, Andy told him we’d been talking about
prison slang.

“The first time I heard ‘shooting jiggers’I thought it was
a racial slur,” said James. He smiled. “When I started out at
Anamosa, I had this watch with a mirror in it. It was perfect
for shooting jiggers."

“How?"

“I just put it through the bars and tilted it,” he said, dem-

onstrating with his hand, “and I had a perfect View of the whole
tier.” He turned to me. “You know, if you really have an interest
in prison, you could get yourselfa deuce.”

“A deuce?"

“An easy, tworyear stretch," he said, maklug a wide arc with
his hand. “Just go out and steal an ATM machine. Ifyou don’t
get caught 7 hey. And if you do,just tell them you're a college
student down on your luck. You’ll get two years and offeasy."

“I think I might just visit from the outside,"1 said. The
prison librarian locked her office, and jordan, Andy, remaining
inmate employees and I followed her out of the library. The
librarian locked the library using a key on a ring that must hold
30 keys. After we ﬁnished our conversation, the inmates walked
toward the yard while I turned left to go outside.

“This isn't a good place," Andy said before he walked away.
“We just make it entertaining "

Jordan

prison—Grinneil Col-
lege partnership is the
only program of its
kindiwherc undergraduate college students design and teach
classes in a prisoniin the United States. Other prisons in Iowa
are considering Grinnells Prison workshop as a model for fu-
ture programs.

The Grinnell prison program started just five years ago
when Betty Brown, chairwoman of the Iowa Department of
Corrections restorative justice department, contacted Grinneil
looking for volunteer teachers. The first Grinneil class at the
prison included a restorative justice employee, a crin'ne victim. a
retired Grinneil professor and four Grinneil students recruited
by the Chaplains office.

Since then, the Grinneil Prison workshop has become en-
tirely student—run. Katie Jares ’07 and I coordinate the group.
Students decide what they want to teach each semester and de
sign a curriculum.

Every semestei, students perform inmate-written plays at
Grinneil and at the prison, put together an art salon where pris-
oners share their work with classmates and Grinneil students
and, every year, work with inmates to publish a literary magar
zine. Grinnellians also bring a Variety of professors and other
speakers, like Pulitzer Prize-winning author Marilynne Robin-
son last December. Grinncll students also help with less liberal
artsrstyle classes, like GED, ESL and job training classes.

The opportunity to participate in prison classes profoundly
affects both the inmates and the Grinneil students who take
part in it. Because of their experience in the program, three of
this year's graduating seniors plan to go on to careers in art in
corrections or corrections reform.

My own dream job is to manage a community garden as
part of an cit-offender re-entry program while continuing to
teach writing to prisoners. Before I entered the prison, itwould
never have crossed my mind,
