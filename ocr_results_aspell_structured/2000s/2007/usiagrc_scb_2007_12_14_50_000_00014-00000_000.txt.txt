Bag 0’ beans

Cont. from pg. 12

Dtarndtic‘lly, he hit the bcanbag a few
times, tenderizlng the stuffofwhlch it is made
to create the optimum level of’flut‘l‘rnessThen,
in an unexpected move, be abandoned that
beanbag and walked to the other Side of the
room to another one.

This time he picked the second bcaubag
up and dragged rt ot-er to the forrncr. He the
pulled rt over his shoulder like a cape and
threw himself on top of the bcanbag on the
ground. He made himselfinto the contents of
a beanbag sandwich,

This boy recreated a situation he had
obviously partakcn rn many times before. I
watched in disbeliefs as he snuggled ruro his
cocoon with only his sneakers and a mop of
hair falling out of either end of the SlllKlWHe‘lL
As he sunk deeper into a REM cycle his head
and his sneakers withdrew into the beanbags
until it looked like two beanbags piled on top
of each other.

My attention returned to my reading while
he slept. But eventually his head and feet
popped out again and the beanhags started to
move. He wasn’t getting out, He was simply
rolling over. His head stviveled around a few
times as he scoped out hrs surroundrrrg, per-
haps rememberrng where he had fallen asleep
after such a refreshing nap. He saw someone
he knew and waved a hello and added, “I'm
so comfortable right now,"As iftlrat explained
the intricate manner of constructing a public
bedroom.

I don’t know if] would allow myself to
sleep publicly in such an intricate fashion, but
I am incredibly impressed that someone else
could. In the spurt of pushing our lrrnits and
being comfortable with the uncomfor-tablc,I
propose beanbags rn every part of campus: in
the dining hall after eating myseltinto a food
coma, on Mac Field (waterproofones) and, of
course, at l—larris when walkmg back home just
isn‘t an option.

SOA responds to criticism of the school

Not only are the “facts" of the article false,
they are a blatant libel of the soldiers who
taught at the Army’s School of the Americas,
because not one example ofanyone using what
he learned there to commit a crime has cvct
been foundinot even one.

Before its closure by law in 2000, the more
than 60,000 who had attended some course
at the school show less than one percent who
had even been accused ofa crime, much less
convicted. The characterization of its purpose
rs absurdihow do you suppose any educa-
tion facility of the Us military corrld operate

openly yet outside the law? The absurdity is
compounded when one considers the VVHlNr
SEC, created in federal law by Congrcss and
President Clinton seven years ago. Not only is
the irrstrtute open to vrsitors any workday, it
is supervised by a military chain ofcommand
AND by a federal committee that includes
members of‘Congrestl

Instead ofstalldlng in thcsti‘ectsofColumr
bus. three miles from the institutc, Grrnnell
students would be better served coming down
when they can stay for a few days.Thcy would
be allowed to sit in any classes, talk wrth any

student or faculty member and review our ins
structronal materials,

I am the public affairs ofﬁcer for the lnStl’
ture and I will pcrsorially see that you get to
examine anything you wish, And by the way, I
went down in the crowd on Sunday, and there
was one lonely police helicopter far above, and
maybe erght or nine thousand in the protest
crowd. Not even SOAVV itself has been able to
maintain the falce that they had 25,000 the'le.

More facts about Indonesia than you can shake a stick at

During my run on the hallowed pages of the Steve, I've
received quitc a few corriments/complimcnts/lctter bombs
regarding my column. I'm frnally starting to appreciate how
a rock star would feel if he wrote for a small college news
paper. Alas, there's still so much to discuss, and increasingly
little time to discuss it in. In the interest of answering as many
questions as I can (and frlling up a
lot of space), I’ve decided to write
this particular column in the ever
popular Qlestion and Answer for—
mat. Consider it my way ofsaying
thanks for reading and keeping rrp
with my insightful and sophisticak
ed commentary that undoubtedly
caused you to take pause. Let's stop dallying and cut right to
the chase:

QThis is a really dumb idea.

A: That’s not really a question.

qwmt are Indonesia’s main exports?

A: Petroleum, lumber from protected rainforests and tort
ruption,

Q Corruption’ Really?

A: That's more like two questions, You're not very good at
following this format.

Q: sorry.

A: That’s also not really a question. Anyway, Indonesia has
shot up recently in the corruption rankings, up to around sixth
or seventh place (Source: The Newsly Herald Tribune Times).
This is remarkable given that Indonesia went through a revolu-
tion in 1998 that was supposed to clean up the government.

QWdl, who was the ”president” before the revolution?

A: An tax—military general with lots ofsuspect ties and powr
ers involving the military,

(mo who's the president now?

A: An exrmilitary general with lots ofsuspecr ties and pow-
ers involving the military. However, he’s got much better hair,
so the people like him a lot.

Q: Surely the corruption doesn’t stop there though? It must
go down into the more local authorities,

A: The police officers that regularly pulled me over for no

Kevin Marcoll‘os ,
Foreign Relations c,
“ ‘ " a! " snappyorcsscr."

CL So, who is the head of the

reason other than sol could bribe them would probably agree
with you.

QDon‘t the police have actual polrcrng to do? I heard there
was some sort of Jakarta version of the Mafia from my Uncle
Cletus. Carri they arrcst those guys instead>

A: They would, but the chieforpolrcc has stated that they
can't since the head of the Mafia
rs “an immensely charismatic indir
vidual who draws followels to hrm
like ﬂies to those cool glowing bug
zappcr thrngies. Also, he's got an
absolutely dazzling smile and is a

mafia then?

A:The chiefof police.

Q: Seriously?

A: Check the main exports again ifyou don't believe me.

QYou'i/e focused a lot on Jakarta in your column. Didn’t
you ever go out into the Thousand Islands.>

A: Ofcourse, and only on the frnest means of transportat
tlon available.

QWhich were?

A: Planes that looked to be old enough
for Charles Lindbergh to be piloting them,
and whose apparent state of regular opera-
tion includes ejecting a worrying amount of
liquid out of the engines at a fairly constant
rate throughout the ﬂight,

QSounds like fun,

A: The best part was that the cockpit door was open, al—
lowing us to gaze in on our two brazen pilots having a cigar
rctte while the trails of smoke curled around the “No Smoking"
st n.

3 Q1 take it you survived then?

A: In can drrnk Jakarta tap water, I can survive anything.

QWhat sorts of animals are out there in the Thousand
Islands?

A: on, the usual suspects. Big ol'Komodo dragons the size
of minivans, Javan rhinos the size ofslightly bigger minivans

NOW

0: That sounds awfu/J
A: Yeah, bur/T’s much better

and orangutans that aren't qurte the srze of minivans but that
won't stop them from folding you up lrke a cheap umbrella.

Ql'm interested m raking a trip to Indonesra. Do you have
any pointers or rnside knowledge that somebody like me corrld
use to get around the country?

A: Stupid qrcstron guy, I’m not showing you any of my
secret moves.

Q How long does it take to get to Jakarra from America=

A: Well, in the bad old days, flying from jalearta to, say,
Washington Dc. would involve flying to srngapore, then
catching a flight to Seoul, then a 15 hour layover, then a flight
to Los Angeles, and frnally taking a flight from LA. to DC.
overall, itwas about a 30 hour trip,

QThat sounds awful!

A: Yeah, but it's much better now. Now you only spend 12
hours in Seoul and lose 30 pounds due to eating airline food.
Happy daysl

Q Once I'm in Indonesia, what do you recommend I see?

A: A good start would be to check out the various giant
statues in Jakarta built during Indonesia's pseudo-communist
phase (this being just before rhe military dictatorship). The
“Spirit onourh" is particularly amusing since the actual frgure

looks to be around 40 years old.

QWhat's this I hear about 3 Washing»
ton Monument ripsof}?

A: You’re thinking of the Monas, which
was the last of those big nationalistic cons
structions meant to bolster the people’s spits
its. It looks essentially like the Washington
Monument except with a nice round shaft,
and large circular base, and a tip made ofgolden flames.

QWow, that sounds even more phallic than the washing-
ton Monument. I didn’t think that was possible.

A: The locals like to call it “Sukarno’s Last Erection."

QWill you ever live there again?

A: I might. But I've already popped back over across the
Paciﬁc a few times, and it's not how it used to be. The things
and the people I grew up with have left or aren't as I remember
them. Wherever home is, it's not there anymore. I guess the
old saying is true: You can't go home again.
