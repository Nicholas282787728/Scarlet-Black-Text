Activrsm, frustration and inspiration at SOA protest

Opinion editor Christina Reynolds recou

Road trips can take vou places you wish
never existed. Two weeks ago, a record 22
Giinnellians drove to Georgia for a taste of the
worst U. 5. foreign policy has to offer. Located at
the Fort Bcnnrng army base in Columbus is the
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security C07
operation. Once culled School of the Americas
(SOA), the 25,000 protesters who held a vigil
at its gates on Nov. 18 still refer to the complex
as SOA and instead know it as “School of the
Assassins.”

Since 1946, thi: SOA has forged 64,000 sole
diers into instruments of our foreign policy~
teaching them how to target civilians in order
to maintain the status quo in Latin America.
To protect the interests of Irrrlllinatlorral corpus
rations and the ruling Classes, SOA graduarcs
have committed atrocities: rape, torture, assasr
sination, massacre. They learned these strategies
ar rhe SOA, ro victimize union organizcrs, rcli-
g‘roirs workers and other activists.

We Grinnellians know about the SOA
thanks largely ro assistant librarian Chris
Gaunt’s nonrviolerit civil disobedience. She
“crossed the line," trespassing onto rhe Fort
Banning grounds, twice. She has done jail time
in expression ofher opposition to the SOA.

Much of my respccr for rhe SOA Watch
nrovement comes from the civil disobedience
of its members. Many locate the origins of this
tradition in the non-violent liberation rheology
practiced by Archbishop Oscar Romero or El
Salvador, After his 1980 assassination, the Unit
ed Nations established that two oftl're three Sal-
vadorian officers responsible were SOAetrained.
Catholic activists and clergy threw rhcmselves
into closing the SOA.

For many years,
the SOA’s activism was
limited—«picture aging
Catholic clergy hun-
ger striking outside the
gates of the SOA. But the face of the move
ment is changing. Not only is the religious left
on board. The kids are, too.

"our spirits are getting younger,"Marrina
La Force'of SOA Watch said Nov. 17 about
the elderly activists, “but our crowds are getting
younger too." Casting a quick eye ar the crowd,
I was quick to agree.

Although a few silver dreadrlocked heads
stood our in the crowd, we made up a mostly
youthful and motley crew——the kind Grinnell
would love to put in a diversity brochurel saw
Sikhs in pro-marijuana t-shirts; husky gmys
wearing Cleveland football jerseys; edgy arr
archisrs whose patches proclaimed, “The only
good fascist is a dead fascist."

But is rhis an curirely good thing?

The crowds certainly are diverse. But
maybe, as the anarchist’s deﬁnitely nor‘rnonr
violcnr patch showed
me, the protest has lost
its focus on noneviolcnt
resistance to the SOA.
Milling through the dcr
cidedly diverse crowd, I
asked myself, “Is the protest tackling too many
issues?”

During my weekend at the gates of Fort
Benning, I learned that it’s absolutely esscnr
tial to oppose CAFTA, rhe Iraq War, rornrrc,
violence in general, Coke, Burger King and, or
course. George Dubya. My head started spine

The SOA Watch protesr doesn'r just rcp-
resent opposition to the School of Assassins.
At the gates of Fort Benning. activrsts busied

paign even got into the act. I admit it: I’m fms-
trated with the lack of focus.

I think my frustration comes from impar
ticnce. so many activists have worked so long
to close the SOA, but American tax dollars
still fund a school that trains Latin American
soldiers to commit human rights violations.
We fund conﬂict elsewhere,
while there is still injustice
within our borders.

So for'me, it‘s tempting
to blame the protesr. I lash
out impatiently: if only we
could focus our efforts, may
be we could make the final
push to convince Congress
to slrrrt down the SOA. We
could ditch the protest, forget
about renting the stage and enormous speakers.
cancel our reservations at the conference center
and Howard Johnson.

More energy and money targeting Congress
mighr mean that, the next time a bill to close
the SOA comes up for a vote, it will pass. And
that is, after all. the point of making the roadtrip

But after reﬂecting on our weekend at the
gates. I am finding it easier to embrace this
messy, all-inclusive proresr. For dedicated activ-
ists, it is clear that the protest is not just a politi-
cal statement.

It is communion with other, equally com-
mitted spirits. I heard over
and over from dedicated
activists that attending the
protest gives them the tens
crgy to keep ﬁghting for
another year. And at this
year’s protest, the commu
nity released the ashes of a
longtime attendee to the
Georgia wind, in accordance
to his wishes.

A trip to Georgia brought Grinnellians face
to face with a shameful example of American
foreign policy. Bur in a crowd of 25,000, with
military helicopters Circling overhead and par
tially drowning out our singing, I found purpose
in the mere act of gathering to bear witness.

How do we put public health in the spotlight without
hyperbole?

Get the communication across. I try to tell stories; there
was a child in Grinnell who found a bat in his house. We
tested it, and it saved so many thousands of dollars, and so
on. People think public health is like public housing. Tell sto-
ries about protecting water, about science that keeps daily life
functioning. In six to eight simple srories,you can tell legiti-
mately the value of real human beings.

You have to talk of outcome. Get people concerned but
not paralyzed wirh fear. Even the word risk sounds fearsome

of a half-dozen issues that they
think everyone cares about.

Why is legislation such as the Kid Safe
Chemicals Act difﬁcult to pass?

It’s going to be challenging to pass be
cause chemical companies have to prove
the safety of their chemicals rather than otherwise. People
may think these amounrs in our warer are measured in “parts
per billion," but I heard a speaker recently that talked about
the amount of Cialis in a human male is measured in parts
per billion. When you measure the effect of Cialis on a male
in that small amount, that’s a way to show the impact. The
fact that we’re exposed to chemicals in utero that we wouldn't
drink in our water is important.

How can Grinnell students play a role
in the fight against pandemies and for ad-
wrncement of global health?

You are living in a protected time period. You can go out
there and champion a cause; I know I did,I was a '60s person.
You can go out and form your thoughts, I’m just a catalyst.
You can have an impact ifyou stand up in the audience. In a
small setting like 10%, you can make a big difference because
there aren't as many political action committees You are
looking down the barrel of the fixture.
