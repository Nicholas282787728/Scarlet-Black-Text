When the snow ﬁnally melts, the frightens

instantaneously—
around campus.
we emerge from
our towers and
enjoy a whole new
dimension of the
Grinnell experir
ence. For most
ﬁrst-years, this is a first spring in Iowa. For the
rest of us, the return of campus bikes, naked
runners and those little wroughteiron tables
outside Saint’s Rest remind us that the year is
almost over. As I enjoy my rourth and ﬁnal
spring in Grinnell. I can't help but recall the
first lovely, busy, bittersweet three.

I remember ﬁrst year, studying for ﬁnals
with my ﬂoormates, sprawled out on blankets
on Read beach. We read and dozed at inter-
vuls while getting sunburned. I memorized a
single hardcover notebook of American For—
eign Policy notes in two long afternoons. I re-
member when Grab n’ Co was in Gardner, and
big impromptu picnics occurred on Cleveland

beach at noon. The Hot Rod Stokers would
bring their guitars, fiddles and banjos out to
the picnic table
while the rest ofus
sat on the grass eats

baby carrots from
SpongeBob bags. I
remember (and still
happily anticipate)
trips to Dari Barn, walking back to campus
along Sixth with the sun in your eyes.

I renrember how unreasonably hot it got in
the springofsophomore year,
falling asleep on top of the
sheets on Loose 3rd to the
sound of box fans whirring
in the windows. And there's
the one day when the spring
weather will inevitably turn
sour.. Relays. I have vivid
memories ofprofessor Moyer in a rain poncho,
shouting through a bullhorn while rain-soaked
Grinnellians drank beer and tripped over each
other on the slippery grass. I remember calm,

bitter: wee! three

spring in Grinnell /can’t help
but recall the first love/y, busy,

almost serious evenings during the spring of
junior year, climbing out my window on Read
2nd, drinking beer at sunset and chatting with
my friends about to graduate.

And last Friday, as though the brilliant
weather prompted some kind of grand opening
of the outdoor Grinnell season,1 witnessed the
conﬂuence of two celebrated bits of Grinnell
al fresco. The track team, advertising for the
Dick in traditional style, ran through central
campus in the warm orange light of late after
noon. They started at the top of the Bucks
haum ramp, shouting and picking up speed,
and then sprinted head-
long into a throng of Dag
Competitors. Foam swords
landed blows on bare backs
as the runners sped past
the Forum. The Dag play-
ers, runners and assembled
spectators couldn’t help
but laugh. Prospie parents stood bafﬂed near
Herrick. A warm breeze moved the branches
of our old, icerbroken trees and I smiled; ant
other Iowa spring was upon us.

Response to

Dear 24 Different Organizations repre-
sented by the Multicultural Manor:

After reading your open letter to the
Grinnell Housing Committee printed in last
week’s SEE, I felt compelled to respond to
what I believe is a misunderstanding on your
part regarding coucgerowned otﬁcampus
project houses. I actually was provoked by
several issues raised in your letter and in the
accompanying scat; article, but I believe that
I can most eloquently and specifically address
your misconception that the Housing Coin-
rnittce, in failing to award a project house for
200772008 to the Multicultural Manor, "neit
ther recognized nor rewarded" the 2006~2007
accomplishments of the Multicultural Manor.

First, I would like to describe the process
ofapplying for and the resulting nature orcolr
lege—owrled oﬁtcampus project houses. Ac-
cording to the procedures {or applying to live
in one of the college's project houses, as use
tailed on the Student Affairs website,“Gioups
desiring a house must submit a project pro-
posal detailing the type of project and ucccsr
sity orhaving a house to carry out the project,
the goals of the project and how the group will
achieve those goals, and how the groups will
be held accountable for the project." Thus an
eligible proposal must contain five elements:

Multicultural Manor letter

a description ofa project, a link between the
project and a house, goals for the project, air
action plan for those goals. and a way to verify
that the project's goals have been met. These
criteria to. a project house proposal reveal that
the selection process is rorwirdrlookr'rrg, res
tjuii-ing prospective groups to present .r project
plan that is based on what each group wants
to accomplish during the next academic year.
The past, for this process, is irrclcvant, And
furthermore, groups that are awarded project
houses for the next year are bound to the plans
they have submitted to the Housing Commiv
toe. much in the way tenants are bound to the
contracts they sign with then landlords.

With .i better understanding of the col-
lege's project houses, I would like to turn to
your letters complaint, the wording ofwhich
reveals your misconception of project houses.
After listing the 20062007 accompllsllments
of the Mlilriculrural Manor, your letter pres
ceeds to lament that, as l have already quoted,
the Multicultural Manor “would neither be
recognized nor rewarded" for its 200672007
successes. Howcvcr, us we now know, the pro
cess of applying for a project house is based
not on previous accomplishmcnts but on pre-
senting a speciﬁc project plan for the upcomr
mg year. Thinking of the process in terms of
