The Wedge to open after fall break

BY Durst; BALLEW

After two years orcalculat'mg logistics and careful planning,
Grinnell College’s campus pub, The wedge, is finally sched-
uled to open in the joe Rosenfield ’25 Cciuer after fall break,
pending the approval of a health inspection and the receipt
ora liquor license. The pub is the realization of several years
oflobbying by outgoing Vice President for student services
Tom crady, and concrete plans that were developed by crady
and the Hall Administration last semester. Although open-
ing night is now only about one month away, some questions
remain unanswered, including what exactly it will looklike and
what drinks will be served.

’ Still, the Pub Planning Committee, a studentrled commits
tee of SGA, has been making signiﬁcant progress. Director or
Residence Life Sheree Andrews said, “everyone involved has
been really helpful and really enthusiastic.”Thc committee re
cently tasted and selected 10 beer choices that will be placed
before the student body for a final vote to select the beer that
will ultimately be served. In addition to narrowing the beer op
tions, the committee will soon select the decor, entertainment,
food choices and management options

When devising the rules that will govern the Wedge, the
planning committee has remarkable control over the decisions
that are made. “The Pub Planning Committee has as much
control as I’ve ever seen a student group have over any project
at this college," Goering said. “We are making great progress
[because] we are blessed with a group orhighly motivated and
dedicated people." Andrews added that the success orthe pub
to this point was due primarily to student input. Still, there are
basic campus, state and federal restrictions that must be fole
lowed. No students under 21 will be allowed to consume alco~
hol, and students under 18 will not be allowed into the pub. In
addition, halfofall sales in the pub must come from nonealcoe
hol sales in order to allow students under 21 to enter.

The committee imposed it‘s own restriction, however, that
only students, faculty or staff who could present a P»Card, or
their guests, would be allowed to enter. “It’s very similar to a
Harris party," Goeting said,

Some students are concerned that these restrictions will
Limit the options for fun in the new pub. “I’m sure the admiri-
istrntors will write up enough rules that I! won't really be as
much of a party or an escape as The Pub in town," said Niek
Spart ’09.

Allison Louthan ’08 said that she was worried the location

of the Wedge in the JRC would only make the college even
more “centralized” by moving more activities into the campus
center. She echoed the concerns of students last year that an
onecampus pub would take needed business away from the pub
in downtown Griunell.

Despite these concerns, Andrews is optimistic that the pub
will be a fun place where the whole campus community—stu-
dents, protessors and start—can “relax and have a good time."

ects] come as more ofa 5urprise,"Osgood said.“Ifwe had com-
mittees {or every project, we’d have a lot of people who would
be exhausted.”

Other reasons cited for the move include the English and
History departments'need rot more space in Mears cottage, as
well as the need to find a permanent home for the Center for
the Humanities. After the move, Hopkins House will be used
as othce space for emeriti taeulty, some orwhom already reside
in the building. In addition, 1205 Park Street is “a beautiful
house and we didn't want to tear it down,"said Osgoodt

1205 Park Street was formerly a themed student house,
most recently Multicultural Manor and Dag House. In order to
offset the loss otsrudent housing, the college added two hous-
es south ofSlxth Avenue on Park street, which were previously
used by ITS, to the housing pool last spring. A desire to make
campus office builde
ings compliant with the
Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (ADA) was
one of the driving {ae-
tors behind the move,
according to Osgood.
Harry Hopkins House,
where the Rosenfleld
Program, CPS and Peace Studies currently reside, has neither
an elevator nor hallways wide enough to accommodate a wheels
chair, whereas 1205 Park Street has unusually witle hallways.

After initial concerns from the building’s future occupants,
the project’s architects solicited input and submitted a more
satisfactory design. “The first [design] had too long hallways,"
Moyer said. “It was just like another sterile other: building."

The second drart, however, will keep the high ceilings of the
original house and maintain a similar architectural style. None-
theless, the building will get some sprucing up Andclson said
he appreciates the building’s new color scheme and the quantity
of“natural light, which keeps people happier and healthier."

“I think the architects have done an admirable job reconr
ceptualizing this building with the addition," he added.

Still, Andelson, Mayer and Vetter will miss their ofﬁces in
Hopkins House. “I like my corner turret. It has that old housey
feel that I like," said Moyet. “Locationrwise, I don’t have any
thing to complain about; I can look down Seventh and up and
down Park. "

’B/gger prolerls have tomm/l—
