Be it resolved

We know, the 565’}? is pretty great But un~
like those popular girls back in high school, we
haven’t peaked yet. Nope. VVe’re setting even
higher standards for ourselves. starting January
lst.

l. The scar; resolves to lose two pages.

2. We resolve to 5 ice up the S5517: drab
wardrobe, Red and bla lil (ﬁbut boring.
News needs rainbowsl Sports needs spiltkles!

3. Due to the success of Grinnell Cribs, we
resolve to introduce “Pimp My Ride: Campus
Bike Edition."

4. We resolve to spice up the Back Page with
a social column documenting the Harris hook'
ups ofthe pastweekend.

Coincidentally, we also resolve to increase
ad revenue by blackmailing the people who
DON’T wilnt to be in the social column.

5.We resolve to offend more sardent groups.
Does anyone really need an alternative to happy
hour anyway?

6. We resolve to stop changing the names
in Perez Hilton stories to those of administra-
tors and publishing them as our own work. (No,
Tom Crady did NOT actually wear those hid-
eous boots to last Monday's movie premiere.)

7. We resolve to quit making jokes about
Dick Williams and the egg. Okay maybe just
one more

8. We resolve to be more entertaining than
the Bids (but we’ll let Steve Briscoc‘s c—mails
remain the funniest campus publication).

9. We resolve to put “This Week in Joint
Board" on the Back Page, where that sort of
fluffbelongs.

10.We resolve to give up on the newspaper
and go into fanfiction instead,

The fire in our bellies burned out

Are today’s students apathetic, or

Something is dead on this campus. No, not self—
governance, which still clings to life with the stubborn
claws ofriostalgia. It is something more vital and fa»
miliar. It is our spirit of righteous survival. And it died
bccausc we no longer need it.

In four ycars,1 have never seen a protest against
this school The only memorable exception is the
small gnthcring of students shouting at trustees two
years ago when tuition hikes were a new problem.
That problem remains, but the demonstrations have
stopped Are we surprised that our tuition is still in~
creasing? Nowadays, Gl‘innelllllns protest the rise of
oldrgtowth forests, the School uftho Americas or the
mass ilings in DarfurWe have stopped fighting for
ourselves; now we right for others,

Part ofmc regrets th' ,and part ofine understands
it. This is not our parents
college, nor are we cole
lcgc students in the same
way our parents were.
The '605 and '705 were
socially defined by open
protests against authority
and rebellion against “the
Man" At Grinnell, 5an
dents overran ARH, stormed Burling, and stole the
president’s medal to express their anger at the system
and its perceived moral inadequacy. Rumor has it that
KDIC was founded as an outlet for the liberal voices
ignored by the thentconservntive too. The college
shut down in the sprrirgof197o because ofrioring over
the shootings at Kent State. Back then, Grrnncllians
used to tear shit up. But we don’t anymore.

When those hippies, our parents, aged and had
kids, they left crvd disobedience out of the principles
imparted to their children. We were raised as a gen-
eration Dfiule'followﬁis,Srudeﬂi’s,son5 and daughters
who work Within the b)bteln instead of against it to
cffcct change, SGA is a popular organization for this
very reason; it's a legitimized forum for voicing com
plaints and proposing change We are lobbyists, not
revolutionaries. We didn't sell out, we bought in.

i do not uieau for this obituary to be a cause for
alarm, nor a senror‘s lament about how the younger

generations don’t get it. The funeral ofour defiance is
something to celebrate, because it means that life for
Grinnell students has never been better. Students at
Grinnell enjoy more opportunities to learn and grow,
moie success in our personal and political endeavors
and nrore respect from the administration and the
nation than at any prior time in this institution’s his
tory. This truth is clear because the cooperation be
tween students and administrators is more necessary
and ielevant every year. We wage a war ofproposals,
wielding petition signatures and chiseled logic to imr
prove our lives and this college. We are building a new
Grinncll instead ofbrealcing an old one.

We owe those protesrors our history, Obviously,
our current accomplishments have foundations on
the ruins of the older system of dorm segregation,

racial inequality and the
like. Likewise, our future
successes will build on our
present programs of loan
caps and wind power, Also
obvious is the perennial
tension between students
and adm lstrators, evir
dent any time the former
tells the latter “why you're here" or the latter insists
that self—governance gives him or her the “right" to
break the law. Patcmalism will never die, nor will the
ignorant insistence of youth. I am not trying to don
scribe Grinnell as utopian—even i would not claim
to have such a skewed vicw— but only as possessing a
definite positive growth in all things good.

I am not trying to make the reader appreciate the
status quo; there's no point insisting on gratitude if
it is to be genuine. i am (not) asking the Admission
office to let the ghost of our renegade sardent body
rest in peace with our other local legends The point
is that we no longer rebel because our rebellion was
successful

Fighting for what we want is only meaningful
if once we have it, we are able to use it to improve
ourselves and our cor nunity. And so have we done.
That, I believe, is the challenge of Grinncll and our
life after.

You’re full of beans, and that’s a very good thing

I don’t know when they showed up.
One day the beanbags were rhcre,with-
out warning or pretense, just waiting to
be slept on. They are my new favorite
objects on campus.

Not only are beanbags the perfect
symbol of laid—back hippies, but you
can’t help but look ridiculous, no matt

down on one. A beanbag is a chair and
a pillow and a lovesear for two in
