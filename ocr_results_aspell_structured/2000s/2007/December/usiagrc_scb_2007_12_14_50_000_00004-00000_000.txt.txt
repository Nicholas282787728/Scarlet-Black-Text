Skinhead drama and spy thriller this weekend

3 This is England
_ (2006)

Provocative story of mis—
guided British youth

The British skinhead movement began in
the 19605 as the working class's adoption of
American pop culture and R&B,bnr it quickly
spiralcd into a haze of neorNazism. misnnr
thropy and anarchism, nit it Eng/mid chronr
icles the journey of 12-year-old Shaun, who
spends a summer submerged in the subversive
world of this skinhead culture,

The ﬁlm opens in the summer of1983.
Shaun's fathei has just died in the Falklands
war, and Shaun himself struggles with bullies
at school. A general sense orhopelessness per
vades the screen as Shaun, nlone. stomps down
beaches as if to make sure that he can make
some impact on the world.

His choice is simple then when a gang of
skinheads rakes pity on him. Sporting his Ben

drawn into the laid— back lifestyle Shaun finds
with his loyal and genuinely hltenble compan-
ionsThings begin to go wrong, however,when
former gang member anti radical nationalist
Combo makes a return and divides the gIoIIp,
dragging Shaun away from his friends and
into a world defined by false principles and
lost morals.

The perrormnnces and direction hit the
movie from a simple period piece to n gritty
and uncompromising portrayal of the devolu-
tion in which many youths found themselves.
Thomas Turgoose perfectly portrays Shaun as
an impressionable and tier youth caught in
political currents of which he can't conceive.
Stephen Graham's Combo provides a fright-
ening insight into the emotionally bereft and
psychologically dnmngcd inner workings of
such a rabid nationalist.

\Nrircr and director Shane Meadows
spit-ed by the experiences or his own Eng isi
youth, draws the most out or each scent: with
an uinclentingly blunt script, sharp and realis-
tic dielogne and an engnging reggae-ﬂavored
soundtrnelt. The movie ironically draws the
connection between the innocent oiigins and
the extremist =nds of the skinhead movement,
a message driven home as we watch Shnun's
world deteriorate iuto nationalistic hate.
