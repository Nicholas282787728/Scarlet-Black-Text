Try free market economics for room-draw efficiency

At Grinnell, evcryone has an opinion.
Most of our opinions, lrkc most of rrs, follow
familiar trends: liberal, socialist, pr‘mcliorcc,
antirwar', clcan fuel, dirty clothes, vegetarian,
alcoholic, indepenr
dent, insecure,
awkrvard and gay, , . .
or at least confuscd. ' ,

And when most ot _

us paint the world 9 ‘ ‘
in the same colors, . be ‘
it’s easy to forget

that other people use a different palette.

In the spirit of holistic diversity, this colt
umn attempts to articulate ideas that may lie
beyond our usual considerations. Everyone
benefits from a contrary opinion. But I do not
want to be thought a wiseacre; the world has
enough Max Postmans in it. This week, the
power of the free press intends to make some
good in our soap-bubble world by proposing
a reform of one of this institution's greatest
causes ofsrudent stress; not 8 am. classes, but
room draw.

Few times in 'a Grinnell student’s life are

as anxious as the weeks precedrng the dreaded
room draw, Students write emails like moth
addicts, frantically asking people with good
numbers if they have a roommate, or would
like one who has
clean feet and a
TV,

Your room lo-
cation affects es-
_ sential aspects of
- “ your life: which

friends you see
regularly; how far you are from class, and thus
how late you can sleep, and how much money
you pay in times at the end ofthe year assum—
ing FM doesn’t charge your
dorm $150 for a broken
pencil sharpener.

The biggest problem
with the room draw system
is that it gives students no
power to choose their numt
bers. A system that allows students to give,sell
or trade their number would beneﬁt people ap—
plying to live otteampus, SAs, underclassmcn

Few times in a Grinnell studenti
hie are as anxious as the weeks
preceding the dreaded room draw,

who want bcttcr rooms, and roommate pairs
where both people have good numbers. In
this system, numbers would still be randomly
assigned, and carlrer gradrrating classes would
still be prioritized overlater
ones. Rawlcs would beam.

\Vhen numbers are
transt’erable, students are
empowered because they
can choose to keep their
number or vie for a bet
ter one. If a student is not
willing to pay for a good
number, then s/he has, in effect, chosen the
number s/he was given, and his/her anxiety
will decrease because s/he
recognizes that s/he is not
powerless. This kind ofex-
istential approach is much
better than the status quo
because we are used to
having options, even if we
chose to throw them offthe loggia.

favoring the wealthy should put down their

the opposite is also true: students can exchange
their numbers for something they value more

To a wealthy student, a high room mm

he might be willing to pay
that much to buy it. To a
student short on cashier

Grinnell administrators, give students the
chance to exchange their numbers. Though
none of us deserves the unusual cruelty otan 8

enough to live in Younker can take solace in
sleeping until 7:58.

 

 

Proud of pride

After I read the article,“427 members ofclass of2011: Big-
gest yet"I was shocked by Jim Sumners quote. surnner was
quoted as saying, “what we're frghting is a reputation that says
we're too activist, too
lett leaning, too gay
friendly," This state
meat is shocking for
many reasons beyond
its homophobic under-
tones.

Many students ap
plied to Grinnell for
its reputation as the
“Gayest College in the Midwest" and if that title makes any
prospective students or their parents wary ofthc college then
it is at the expense ofthe safety and inclusion ofan ofrcnemare
ginalreed student population. Grinnell doesnt lose out when
closedrminded students choose different schools.

The administration should be embracing its left-loaning
students, its activists, as well as the gay students on campus, as
they build the core foundation ofwhat Grinnell stands for and
has for decades.This is yet another example of the administrae
tion‘s emphasis on reputation over substance,

Yes. Grinnell embraces its gay populatron. Yes, Grinnell is
traditionally rt school of liberal activists. Yes, Grinnell is left
leaning. Anyone who trres to fight that reputation is ﬁghting
the basic culture of our campus. 1fthat reputation doesn't at in
with the way top Iowa students parents brought up their chilt
dren, they should send their children somewhere else,

The only reputation the admissions office should be fightr
iug, ifany, is one ofa righttleaning administration out oftouch
with its leftrleaning students,

Grinnell doesn’t lose out when
closedtrnt'nded students choose
different sthoa/s,

Prettier in pink

On Oct. 8, 1891, we lost pink as our school color: It’s tr

to claim it back. With th year's World Almanac open,I or
my case. In NCAA Division I alone, thrcc schoolsisan DI’
ego State, Arkansas State and Texas chl‘r'wcar scarlet and
black—yes, scarlet and black. Allow other reds with black and
you add Troy State, Northern lllinois, Cincinnati, south Caro~
lina, Georgia, Louisville and Northeastern, How many schools
in Divisions II and III’ A htrndrctP How many high schools
and middle schools from Atlantic to Paciﬁc’ A thousand?
Bloody crowded.

If we restored pink, we would rejoin that small klatch of
schools that esteem a single color: Syracuse, Cambridge, Har-
vard, Oxford and Rutgers. Among them our cheerful but:
would be unique.

Ianticrpate objections, “Sports team X doesn't want to comr
pole in pink jerseys," Idon't know, think of something: The
school color's pink, brrt the football colors are gray, pink, and
blackror any other colors for that matter. But don't tell me
pink’s not fresh or is a marketing mistake Tire London shirt-
maker Thomas Pink is filling magazines with its roscatc ads
and dotting the map with its woodrpniaclcd shops. In short,
pink sells.

The Oct. 17, 1891, issue of the [/an reports that the suit
dent body voted rrs out of pink. So it's your droit, students, to
vote it back. Make our school color say what you kIIOW#[l\Il(
Grinnell's unique.

Sumner offends,
groups react

Recently, the stair published a quote from Jim Sumner, the
dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, which addressed pot
tential reasons why Grinnell College has been drawing a lower
number ofnew students from Iowa. He cited the colleges repti-
tation as a “too activist, too left—leaning, too gay-friendly"insti~
tution as part of the decrease in students from Iowa. Accord
ing to Dean Sumner, this reputation is “worrisome" to Iowan
parents.

Though this may be true,we feel it is important to consider
both Grinnell's longtstanding tradition of social activism, liber-
alism and tolerance,as well as the recent progress made towards
creating a campus where queer students of all types can feel
safe. Intercstrngly enough, these two Conccpts are inextricably
linkcd. It was the actrvrsrn ofthe student body that helped push
for the addition of Gender Neutral Housing, which is in its
novicc your on campus. It was student activism that created the
Stonewall Resource Center.

Through our activism, we, as students, are committed to
helping change the world for the better. Through our liberal-
ism, we ptornotc tole race and accept cc, though, as with all
things, it sometimes ,These two traits ofthe student body
arc what continue to draw students from all walks ol'lifc, from
across the country, to the college

As students of the college, we at

mg the reputation ofs 1 act ti and liberalism wrll

ly change what it means to he Grinnelli n.As leaders

in the queer community, we are concerned that dccmphasizrng
the "gnyrfrrcndly" reputation of the college will push all fin—

ncerrretl that tleemt

ther progress on addressing LGBTQ‘rssues to the back burner,
and, thus, halt the further development ofa safe community for

queer students.

Pick the new guy

If you’ve been rollowing Democratic primaries, you may
have noticed that frvc of thc sight candidates have recently
served as US. Senators. Of these Senatorrcandidates, the four
who held office for the entirety of Bush's first term have a lot
rn common. Among other things, they all voted in favor ofthe
No Child Left Behind Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. Per-
haps most tragically, they all voted for the 2002 authorization
ofmilitdry action against Iraq. In short, John Edwards, Hillary
Clinton,]oc Biden and Chris Dodd all played the roll: ofthe
submissive opposition when America most needed a fearless
resistance.

And then there’s the new guy: Barack Obama.

During his bid to be the Illinois Democratic nominee for
us. senate, Obama took an enormous political risk by oppos—
ing the Iraq War authorization. In January of2007, Barack be»
came the first ofthe Presidential candidates to introduce bind-
ing legrslarioa to withdraw Us, forces from Iraq.

Obama’s position on the war isn't the only issue on which
he has distingurshed himself from his Senate colleagues, to
has also introduced legislation to reform immigration policy
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the fight against cor—

- ruption,

There are cynics
who scoff at Senator
Obama’s record and
note that, compared to
the other candidates,
he doesn't have much
experience on the na-
tionai political scene.
_ My response: so what>

He's madc the most ofthe cxpcticucc that he's had He's prover:
himsclfto be an indcpcndent thinker and a icadcr‘,\’Vc'rc better
off nominating a frcsh facc than a Washington rns er assocr
ated with the mass caprtulatrons ottlru past.

Now is as good a time as any to embrace “the politics of
hope." Nominating the Ncrv Guy would send a powcrﬁrl rucs—
sage to thc country; We Democrats are ready ror changewc'te
done with being the submissive oppos r We're ready to
