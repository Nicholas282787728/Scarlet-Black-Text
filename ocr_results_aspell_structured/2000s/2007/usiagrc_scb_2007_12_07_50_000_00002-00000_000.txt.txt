State of the College is postponed

BY MATT ZMUDKA

Soup, selfegovernance and surveys will be just a few of the
topics served up at SGA President Megan Goering 'os’s State
of the College address, intended to facilitate important connec
tions between students and their campus government

The address, originally scheduled for lastTuesday, has been
moved to next Tuesday, Dec. 11, to prevent a scheduling con—
ﬂict with Barack Obama’s campaign rally. "We wanted to be
sure that we would be holding the event at a time when stun
dents would be able to make it and feel compelled to make it,"
Goering said.

To draw people to the hour—long event beginning at 7 p.m.,
student-made soups will be sewed. “There will be lots of difs
terent kinds of homercooked soup, which is a great thing dur
ing a cold, hell week," she said, adding that donations will be
taken for groups which did not receive FogFast funding this
semester.

Goering hopes to build on the success offormer President
Chris Hall ’07s inaugural state of the College speech last year,
which was “very wellearrended." Goerlng's speech will focus on
SGA’s accomplishments so far this year in regards to campaign

Her speech will also include an extended discussion on cons
ccrns regarding sclfegovcrnance. “We can get some feedback
and start a conversation about self—governance this semester,
where it’s gone, how well it’s worked and maybe not worked,"
she said, noting that there have been "different manifestations"
ofproblems with selfrgovernance this year. '
