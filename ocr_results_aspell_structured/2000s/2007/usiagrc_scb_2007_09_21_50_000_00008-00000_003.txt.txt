andidates to choose from, but no

It was sunday morning and I was seriously hungover, with a swollen
brow sustained due to a Saturday night dance collision, but I hauled
'selfout ofbed earlier than lunchtime, slipped on my most professional

rolling rural hills that scream “America’s Heartland” photoshoot op-
rtunities, Indianola, Iowa, is swamped one day a year with the annual

improving our infamous education and healthcaie systems (scrap No

constituents, I moped on the grass and fantasized about voting for
Dennis Kucinich out ofspite.

Until Hillary started speaking and I got caught up in her emotional
stories about a 90-year woman she’s met on the trail who told her, “I was
born betoreworncn got the right to vote and I'm going to live to see the

would eat steak off Styrofoam plates and then drive home.

Chris Dodd spoke after Hillary, but by that time I’d struck up con-

Eventually the event wound down and the crowds of constituents
ﬁltered out, leaving plastic lemonade crips and Hillary popcorn holders

were packing up their gear and groups ofvolunteers plucking campaign

Enthused group
starts small

The large meeting room was overﬂowing with ope
timism. Bill Richardson is “the only candidate who’s
climbing" in the polls in Iowa. The De Moiim Regine/s
celebrated political grim, David chsen, had just declared
that Richardson had given the best Steak Fry speech.ThC
hope reached a fever pitch when visiting Richardson held
director Katie McCoid predicted that New Hampshire
“could come down to a RichardsoneClinton race."

The optimism was particularly striking given that the
2007 inaugural meeting of the Bill Richardson Grinnell
student gioup had all ofthree students in attendance.

McCoid had driven down from Iowa City to help
de facto group leader Garrett Fortin ’11 kick off a pro-
Richardson group and dispense campaign materials. if
anyone there was disappointed by the low turnout, they
were not admitting it in my hearing.

They discussed plans to table, canvas, leaﬂet, do “lit
dropsl'and call area voters, all “as we get more volunteers."
The key word for this brave band is not if, but when.

This is how life is for supporters ofBill Richardson,
the energetic New Mexico governor and former justr
aboutteverything currently languishing in the “second
tier" of Democratic candidates. His fundraising has been
surprisinglystrong, even surpassing John Edwards's in the
second quarter of this year But most voters have yet to
warm to this gregarious “experienced" candidate.

Fortin and his two fellow students at the introduc-
tory meeting (all of them ﬁrsttyears) say the problem is
that vorersjusr don’t know as much about Richardson as
they do about more glamorous "rock star"candidates like
Clinton, Obama and Edwards.

“What we want is to help people learn more about
Bill Richardson,"Fortin explained.

The Richardson campaign tries to help people learn
more about Bill by sending out a press release every few

Not that the prorBill crowd gets out ofhand in their
expectations. Supporters are urged to stay positive and
not attack other candidates. When one of the ﬂashicr

explains, Richardson needs to be situated as the second
choice candidate of all stripes of caucus—goers. From
there, Richardson will win Iowa and ride the bounce all
