Students form
Turkish club

Turkish and Greek students aim to
promote understanding of their region
after a controversy with a professor

BYJEI‘F R.\ DERSTRDNG

Fatosh Dilgakiran 09 arrived at her American Beliefs and
Cultural Values class last week ready to talk about her Turkish
heritage. After she told the class how her experience in America
has strengthened her sense of self 15 a Turk, the professor tar
spended by using a expletive to say tliirr she did not care about
Turkish history and did not care to learn about it. Despite “p,
parent ambigrity about what the professor actually meant, her
refusal to apologize to Dalgakiran prompted the junior to rake
action.

Out of this incident, the Turkish and Greek Cultures Apr

preciation Club was
formed The club is
planning on hosting
events to let people learn
more about their culture
in hopes that similar
incidents will not occur
again.
“I want people to be kepr up to date on rhe issues ofthe re
gion," said AliTitiz‘08 ofTurkey, a founder of the groupThey
are looking to bring Turkish scholars to campus to talk about
current events, along with more participatory gatherings high-
lighting Turkish food and hookah. They will also have weekly
meetings where all are welcome.

“We want this to be a clear message: It's not for us only, it's
for all Grinnell College students,” said Ioannis Loukakis '08, a
Greek member ofthe new group .

One goal of the club is to dispel the belief that there is
underlying tension bctwccn Greeks and Turks and show they
are actually very similar, hence the name “Turkish and Greek
cultures Appreciation Club." The current group members hail
from Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, and Daigakiran received sup-
port from all members ofthe international strident community
after word spread of the incident, Greek and Turk alike

“It’s a fact that there
are not many differences
between the two cul-
tures,"said Loukakis.

After the incident,
Dalgskirin, who is from
Cyprus, met with the
professor, Kesho Scott,
Sociology, and asked for
an apology. Dulgakiran
was not satisﬁed with the outcome ofthe meeting and eventur
ally dropped the class. “She didn't apologize to the fact that
she offended my history,” said Dalgakiran. “She just said that
she was sorry I was offended.”

Dalgakiran and otherTurkish students have expressed their
concerns about the classroom situation to administration meme
hers and SGA.The members ofthe newly formed club sav they
do not have resentment towards Scott, who declined to come
ment for this article, but see this as a glen! chance to create
something positive. “We thought it would be good idea to take
this opportunity to advertise our culture," said Tiriz,

“This issue could repeat itself," sard Dalgakiran. “We .
want her [Scott] to be a little more careful when she's talk g
about other cultures'

Brit they also do not want their club do be defined by one
professor s remarks. We don‘t w int this incident to shadow the
Tr .11 club on this c1mpus,"saidT They plan to nor dwell
on what happened and move on to spreading awareness about
their heritage Said HilmiUlirs 09, another founder froinTurr
key [This club] is iibout helping people get ro know these two
beautiful Mediterranean cultures."

(Wind) power to the people

BY CHRIS NEUBERT

“It's going to happen,"said President Russell Osgood.

After years of waiting for deﬁnitive answers, Osgood is now
ready to commit to constructing wind turbines on campusThc
urrbines are part ofa larger effort to reduce Grinnell's overall
carbon cmis us. While construction will not begin on the
turbines iinti plans are ﬁnalized and currently planned cont
struction is complete, students who have been involved with the
efforr to bring turbines to campus are understandably excited.

The proposed carbon emissions reduction proposal was der
veioped following discussions last semester abour the American
college and University Presidents Climate commitment. 05-
good said that instead of an agreement with "no meat on the
bones,"hc asked Facilities Management and Institutional Plan-
ning to draft a commitment rhar was “more aggressive," The
result was the current commitment that plans to reduce carbon
emissions to 20 percent below anticipated 2010 levels.

‘This is -ireai, reasonable approach, Osgood s‘aid, buti
believe we can beat that goal."

While Free the Planet! spent much of last semester lob»
bying Osgood to sign rhe Presidents Ciimarc commitment,
members are satisfied with the proposed solution. "This is a big
step for the college, said Andre Fait'09.‘ it will improve the
colleges image, and is .i real commitment to social and environt
mental responsibility

“Its aborn time no live rip to our cnvivonrncnral commit-
ment," FTP curleadcr Nathan Pavlovic'll) adtlcd. Pavlovic and
Fair agreed that their only serious concern was the lack of an
apparent deadline in the draft. “\Ve would like to see deadline
for achieving this included in any proposal."l>irvlovit said.

Osgood said he opposed signing the earlier commitment
because it callcd for total car-hon iicurriliry—a goal that he felt
was rrlrirnately unrealivabieranrl because it lacked any enforce—
ment measures.

Environmental coordinator Chris Bait said hi: supports
“green tags,"wherc property owners receive credit for tuning
carbon emissions, as “the only real way to achieve carbon ncut

trality."

Osgood, who has consistently opposed any proposal to use
carbon offsets srrch as green tags to meet any carbon commits
merits, disagreed. “ e shouldn't buy the goodness ofothers to
cover our own sins." .

Bait said that the currently proposed commitment offers a
goaltl‘iat“tve can reasonably achieve."Still,rhere are othersteps
that must occur before the turbines are ready, including a study '
to determine the impact on the local grid, choosing the best
model turbines and acquiring and leasing the necessary land.
Ultimately, borlr FTP and Osgood feel that the money saved
by producing our own energy and selling any excess will offset
the costs of the multimillion-dollar project.

“This is probably more aggressive in the short term than
schools that did sign that agreement,"said Bait.

And wind power is not the only program prescribed in the
draft proposal, Other plans to reduce the college's carbon foot-
print include geothermal heating in the proposed PEC Phase
11 natatorium, continuing measures to improve efﬁciency in
buildings and efforts to inculcate green behavior on campus,
Bait said that the best action students could take to reduce their
own environmental impact would be to turn of? lights, unplug
chargers and reduce waste,

According to Osgood, it is important to ensure that stilt
denrs, iaculty and staff are also making a commitment to rot
duct carbon emissions through changing behavior-s. “Ifwc‘re
going to inc-er ain- t get, or do better, everybody needs to be (in
board," he said “were not going to get our levels down unless-
we’re all more restrained."

In addition, FTP is planning a series ofnrcasur-es this week
to shore irp student support for the latest proposal, including
a strident initiative and presentation to the Board othustccs, '
“There 1 s been consistently strong support from the student
body for wind power, said Fair.

\Vhile the trustees might makc minor changes or additions
to the policy, Osgood said he expects the conirnirmcnt guide
Grinncll's onvrronrncntal policy for several years.
