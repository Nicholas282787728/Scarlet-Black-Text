After 31 years of enriching the lives of
Grinnell students professor Bobbie McKibs
hin Art will retire from teaching at the end of
this year to work full time as an artist.

McKibbin ﬁrst came to Grinncll as a tem-
por'ary professor arrer reaching ar rhe Urriver»
snv of Miami in Ohio, where she ‘rttent‘lcd
graduate school 'I VV’IS hired at Grinnell as a
temporary professor for two semesters," she
said. “I liked it so much,I stayed for another
60 ”

During McKibbiri's ienure, she has iangln
panning, drawing, design and printmaking at
all levels. “I have taught Intro to Painting to
students who say, ‘1 don’t know how to do any
of this,” she said. “What I want students ro
rake away trorn rhe class is that we teach each
other how to see and think visually I tell
people I’m a language teacher. I'm reaching a
ﬁgurative language. It has grammar and rules.
lfyou work hard enough you will become pro—

' fieient in rhe language."

Julie Edwards ’07, who has taken three
classes with McKlbbin, said that the profess
sor's introductory class welcomed both experis
enced artists and those who were picking up a
paintbrush for the first time. “She made them

all feel that they were on an equal level she
said. She respected all oftheir work

Edwards also enjoyed the inrirnaey of
McKibbin’s upper-level courses like Advanced
Painring. She onyoys discussing po- lcs, cul-
ture and the crinnell campus with hIcIGhbiu
justas much as she eniovsdiscussrng a .“Slie

“I rhink shes one or the few teachers I’ve
had who's very engaged in the rurnnnrnrry,“
Edwards said. “She goes to all the writing
events. I've run into her at pretty much any
art, dancing, drama performance."

Other students praised Mel<rhorns opens '

ricss. “I like that she lets you go in your own
direerion," said Kat York ’08, who has taken
two Courses with McKihhin. “She seems a lot
more like a real person than orhcr profs it’s
refreshing."

Asia sample '10 agreed: “She's very paSs
sioiinte about her art and it rubs off,”

' Another ochKihbin’s students, Christena
McIntyre ’07, said she liked McIbein's abil-
ity to give constructive criticism. “She's really
speciﬁe,"McIntyre said, “She’ll rell you what’s
good and what’s not."

Amos Goldbaum '07 also praised McKib-
bin’s ability to assess her students: “She gives

really good neck and back massages while she
critiques yourwork," he said

McKibbin, who Is transgender, said
Grinnellians have been nothing our acecpring
of her identity. “When I became iransgender,
President [Pamela] Ferguson called me and
said: ‘Wliat can I do to help?” she said. “My
students and the [Grlnnckl] community did
not skip a heat. It has never been necessary
to ralk ahour it, I'm just another lnnnan be—
ing rrying to make .1 difference, Occasionally
a student will have a question, and we will talk
about it.”

After retiringMcKlbbin plans to dedicate
herself to her artwork; she and her wife Intend
to move to Montana; though not irnnaediarely.
McKibbin uscs pastels to depicr narural and
manmttde landscapes. A piece she creared tor
CERA will be unveiled at the prairie festival
on May 12

“I think she's. ready to go,“ said Edwards.
“Although it's hard for us, it‘s good to know
that she's come to terms with Elml."

York said Grinncll will besad to see MCK-
ibbin go. “Shes kind of a legend. Shes hot
spit York said, echoing what she called a

“tpradematk Bobbie-Ism.”
