SRC finds home' In Younker

Pit lounge IS fourth location in four years for GLBTQA groups

by MARIO MACIAS

Despite having a large queer community on campus, stu-
dents have often had a hard time ﬁnding the Stonewall Res
source Center (SRC), the student offices for gay, lesbian, his
sexual and transgender students. Last year it was in the JRC,
the year before in Loose Pit. Now, it has found a home in the
Younker Pit, in the lounge formerly for smoking. And “This
time it’s permanent," said office manager Lauro Franco ’03.

Franco echoed student concerns that the nomadic move—
ment of the SRC has made it difﬁcult to build ii sense of 5011-
darity among the queer community and allies on campus.The
move to the JRC was meant to be permanent, but after stu-
dents complaints, Vice President ofStudent Affairs Tom Crady
worked with students to choose the new site in Younker Piti

Lindsay Robinson '09, the SRC library coordinator, said that
among groups that use the space, there was a general consensus
that the JRC was “really inappropriate because a room that
size doesn‘t work for the number of student groups we serve."

"For the first time in a long while," she added, “we finally
have on adequate space."

With its new location, the SRC now includes a much larger
common room than the offices in the JRC, Activities such as
the recent “TierDye and General Merriment" were a friendly

success thanks to the “friendly, inviting and most of all big
space” that Younker Pit provides, said Robinson. Moreover, be-
ing inside a student lounge, the new SRC is more open to a
“homey" ambiance that seeks to promote “confidentiality and
safe space for all its members," Franco added.

In just the first few weeks ofthe semester, there have been
more visits to the SRC than there had been at its JRC location.
Students feel more comfortable hanging out at the basement
lounge, said assistant programming coordinator Jess Cheney
'09, than at the ‘‘cold and impersonal" environment of the JRC
office.

Nevertheless, the SRC maintains an office of operations
under Student Affairs in the Multicultural wing of the JRC for
all their formal, administrative business.

This latest move is n result of plans that were first discussed
In early May when a committee was formed to explore possible
locations for the SRC and to address demands for furniture and
more items for the SRC library.

Returning to Loose Pit was out of the question, said Vice
President of Student Affairs Tom Crady, since the space was
“inadequate." Crady said that it was agreed that Younker Pit
would be a “favorable change."

Previously: the basement lounge was home to KDIC and
had iecently been transfonned into the North Campus smok-
ing, lounge According to Crady, there has been no negative
rcncrion from foimcr users of thc smoking lounge, and sugr
gcsrcd thrt most snrdcnrs rn Younkcl wcie glad tlilIt the smoke
had been removed

Ultimately, Fianco said, this change will benefit the campus
.rnd is bound to drrvc upcoming tvcnrs such as Coming out
rvcclt. Starting Snmrdnv Oct. 6 the SRC expects to organize
numerous events for the LGBT community and rrilrcs such is u
coming out piittv and the inlrmnus drug show lhanles to the
Xounkei Pit location, Cheney said the new SRC is now “not so
our of the wily, not so out in the open.

Everyone finally feels, said Fiance, like“ it family under one
roof."

New Joint
Board elected

Voting is high, but candidates outnum-
ber Constituents at open forums

Chris Had: ’10 spent Monday afternoon riding his bike
through a rainstorm, racing between offrcampus houses as he
tried to meet and greet as many voters as possible. When his
doorrknocklng turned up a student, he’d give the Grinnellirm
a rundown of the Ieasons he wanted to sacriﬁce his semester
to serve as SGA senatorr Chief among student concerns, Hade
said, were a desire to fight the “introverted" nature of SGA itnd
make “real, concrete change" in student lives. Hade’s door—to~
door greeting was pait ofa week-long campaign in the run-rip
to elections all day Monday

Results released follow
ing the Monday election ltnd
VVednesdny iunoff indicate
that both voter turnout and the
number ofcandrdntes are higher
than in recent years. Each cans
didate is vying for the pIIvIr
lege to attend hours-long Joint
Board sessions every Wednes-
day night in JRC 101, In addir
tion to attending various mm,
mittee meetings on campus. During the short campaign week,
candidates tried to convince students that they could effectively
represent them in Joint Board through old-fashioned door-to-
door campaigning, public posteting or open forums

The open forums, however, suffer from a notorious staple
of election behavior: low turnout. At the OCCO/OCNCO
senator’s forum held in Bob’s the night ofThursday, Sept. 6,
the number of constituents who showed up—fout—was less
than the number ofcandidatesifive.The Loosehead open far
rum Sunday night was livelier. While the talk starred with only
three constituents, it eventually drew in three more.

The forums, which
SGA Vice President for
Student Affairs Jan K07
szewski '08 said used to
have “massive turnout”
when run by some,
have seen decreasing
participation over the
last few elections, even
as voter turnout has
increased. “It‘s a lot
of work [for Election
Board] to pull together
both the open forums
and the election," Ko-
szewski said. “Simple breakdowns in communication may have
led to lower turnout."

At the open forum for Loosehead, which was lightly are
tended considering the intense competition in this Iace, severul
of the six students running voiced frustration over the ineffec-
tiveness of Jornr Bonrd. “Joint Board isn't a legislative body,"
said candidate Max Postman ’02. “Outside ofallocating budget
money, Joint Borrrd his no power.“ Postman said during the
forum that he felt the group should hrndumenrully change Its
direction. “Joint Board should be ri chldy debate on the future
of Grinnell College."

Candidate Lu Lienemunn '08 responded that rhc college
doesn't need “debate for the sake of debate" but agreed Jomt
Board does have limited effectiveness. “joint Boaid can be a
rubber stump," she said.

Drnny HlIIIpt '08, running for his first term as scnnror,
agreed with both Lienernunn nnd Postman. “There rs a huge
