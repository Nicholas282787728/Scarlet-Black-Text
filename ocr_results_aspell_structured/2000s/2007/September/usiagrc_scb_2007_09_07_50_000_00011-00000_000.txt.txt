Wallace goes from locker room to
office in Athletic Director shift

by NIKKIJAMESON

For 20 years, Greg Wallace has taken on
the responsibility of handling 50 rowdy footr
ball players everyday at practiee. Hopefully,
this experience will be adequate training for
Wallace, as his move into the thletic director's
office means that the number of athletes under
his watch will swtﬂl to 400, plus their coaches.

Wallace officially began his role as athletic
director on July 1, ascending from the posie
tion ofassistant athletic director to replace the
departing Dec Fairchild. Given the late start
of Wallace’s tenure, he Will juggle two jobs
this year, making it a transitional period for
him. He will remain Grinnell’s head football
coach until the end of the season, when he will
step down to focus on his new responsibilities.
Wallace agrees that it's a big change, especially
after 20 years on the sidelines, but he feels pres
pared to make sure that both onrtherﬁeld and
administrative operations run smoothly.

This year also marks the perfect time for
Wallaee to adjust to his new job. He explained
that the department underwent both internal
and external reviews lastyear,with both show-
ing no need for any dramatic change.

one should not think ofWallacc as just the
athletic director, though, isolating him within
Grinnell's inclusive athlete community. Wale

lace also received the title director of Recre-
ation upon starting his ncwjob. This new ad—
dition is part of the athletic department’s push
to play a role in more than just athletics and to
promote that all students should be involved in
campus athletics, notj'ust athletes,

"Physical activity is an outlet for students
to get away from the classrooms and [their]
studies," Wallace said. He wants to remind
students that e one has access to the cam—
pus training fac es, and hopes that the num-
ber of students who use these facilities will rise,
either through participation in RE. classes,
intramural and club sports or the steadily ex»
panding number ofcampus athletic clubs.

In otderto encourage student participation
in onrcampus athletics,Wallace has ambitious
proposals for the future. Plans are in the works
for a new dance studio, rock climbing wall
and a field house. Ifeverything is approved by
the end of the fall, the new facilities will be
finished by the fall of 2010. The completion
date means that three—quarters of the current
Grinnell campus might not see the ﬁnished
product, but Wallace is looking out for the
long-term athletic prospect of the college.

When the facilities are ﬁnished, Wallace
said, “We may have among the best facilities
in Division III."

Steely-eyed Remington
ready to replace Pfalzer
at quarterback

til/JORDAN KUJALA

Qlartcrback Scan Pfalr
zer '07 was undoubtedly the
bright spot in the Grinnell
football team’s otherwise
lackluster 2—8 season in 2006.
He did everything, lead-
ing the team in both passing
(2124 yards) and rushing (725
yards) while also doubling as
the team’s punter.

Often times, his pure ath~
lctic ability allowed him to
turn a sure sack into a mod-
est if not substantial gain for
the offense. During a critical
two-point conversion last sear
son in a game against Knox,
Pfalzer dropped back, only to
see Knox defenders barrel~
ing after him. He scrambled
farther back and traversed the
entire width of the ﬁeld, elud-
ing a number of tackles and
ﬁnally ﬁnding Todd Doleshal
’08 in the corner of the end
zone, connecting on a pass
from 25 yards behind the line
of scrimmage to help spark
Grinncll's comeback and an
eventual 35-34 victory.

Pfalzer's graduation,
though, forced the Pioneers
to undertake the difficult task
of replacing their most valu-
able player. Grinnell has not
recruited a quarterback in
several years, and has no true
player at the position on the
roster.

Thus, the job has fallen
to WRITE Ben Remington
'08, who is poised to fill the
role even though his only col»

lege quarterbaeking experir
once has involved running the
scout team. He hasn‘t played
quarterback consistently since
high school, where he was all
conference and third team
All-State during his senior
year at Marion High School
in Marion, Iowa.

Remington knows that he
won’t be able to match Pfal-
zer’s all-around production,
but he doesn't think he'll have
to. "Pfalzer did everything,"
Remington said, but "other
guys on this team have the
talent [and] I don't need to do
what he did."

The change in quarter-
back should only slightly al»
ter the Grinnell offense. Fans
will still see the freewheelr
ing, higlrpowered offense of
years past, but with less den
signed quarterback runs. But
that could change quickly.
Remington showed his own
running prowess by scram-
bling for two touchdowns in
a season opening loss versus
Kenyon. In addition, he had
a good day in the air, complete
ing 16 of 29 passes for 225
yards and three touchdowns,
a promising start given Rem-
ington’s lengthy layoff since
his last game experience as
quarterback.

Remington refuses to take
credit, though, insisting that
his rushing touchdowns were
the result of excellent seal
blocking by the offensive line
instead ofhis own scrambling

abilities.

Grinnell’s offensive line
is a highlight of this year's
team, returning all five star-re
ers, including 2006 MWC
Aleronference second team
tackle Andrew Larue ‘10.

Unsurprisingly, Larue
mirrors his quarterback in
refusing to take any credit for
the lack of offensive grove
ing pains to start the season.
“[Remington] has stepped
up this year as our offensive
leader, leading by example as
well as giving us a verbal lift,”
Latue said.

Despite giving up four
sacks against Kenyon, Renae
ington trustsr his line, and
reported having “no pressure
[while] throwing the ball.”
This will be a key to sustain-
ing drives, tipping the time of
possession in Grinnell's favor
and giving Remington room
to run and throw, even if his
carries don't match Pfalzer’s
output from last year. Rem~
ington and his line’s mutual
adoration will be tested this
weekend, when conference
favorite St. Norbert comes
to town for Gtinncll's home
opener

miestions still remain for
the ﬁlture, Right now, it isn't
certain whether a quarterback
recruit Will be found for next
season, or what will happen if
an injury befalls Remington
this year. For now, though,
the position seems to be in
capable hands.
