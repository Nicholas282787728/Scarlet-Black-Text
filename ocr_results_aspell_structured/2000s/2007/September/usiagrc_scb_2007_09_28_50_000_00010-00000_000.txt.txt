Pioneers stop Viking quest for comeback

BY DRAKE BALLEW

Afrcr withstanding a late charge and cincrg- ‘

ing victorious from their 24719 thriller against
Lilwlence College, thc Pioneels were expectedly
excited about their first win of the year:

“I’m really proud ofout gnys,"said head coach .

Greg Wallace. “Lawrence is a good team. They
have an attacking dcfcnsc and can do some nice
things offensively."

“We have a considerable amount of young
guys," said Nick Merklin ’08. "Getting a win is a
great way to boost their conﬁdence as well as the
team's."

On Saturday, Mcrldin opened the scoring on
the receiving end of quarterback Ben Remington

’os's pass up the middle, turning a ls7yard com7 '

pletion into an 83-yard touchdown pass.

Six minutes later, Remington found Todd
Doleshal '08 for as more yards up the left sideline
until he was knocked out of bounds at the two-

yard line. Marquis Bradley '11 marched into the ‘

endzone from there. The Pioneers went into the
locker room up 1470 at the half, and looked like
they could cruise to victory.

In the second half, however, Lawrence mount
ed a comeback ofits own, tightening the score to
24-19 with under six minutes to play. Lawrence
had one shor at complcring thc comcbach

After a series or passes by their quarterback
Nick Maxam, Lawrence stood on Grinnell’s 31
with over a minutc to play, plenty of time to
work the ball into the end zone, But two plays
later, lVlnxrlm threw a pass up the middle of the
field, which Ben VVcstl'eldt '08 picked offzit the
Glinnell io7yaid line, securing the win for the
Pioneers.

Westfcldt was undoubtedly the Pioneers doe
fensive MVP. He not only scaled the Pioneer vies
tory but also made three tackles and recovered a
Lawrence fumble, also in the fourth quarter,.

However, there is little time to celebrate, with
next wcck's game against a tough Monmouth
College looming. “We will be facing the best den
fense in the conference,”Doleshal said. “The key
will be consistently executing our assignments."

Consistency remains one of the big questions
surrounding this Pioneer team. Against Law-
rence, the Pioneers touchdown drives all relied on
a big play instead of a consistent move-the—chains
style offense, not something the Pioneers can de-
pend on.

This weekend at Monmouth (3»1, 3-0
MWC), the team will surely need to execute
more long, clock-killing drives in order to tire out
Monmouth's strong defense, keep their own dc—
fense from spending a disproportionate amount
of time on the field and give themselves a chance

at victory.

But Merklin says that they are up to the
task. “Monmouth is a bigger and more physi—
cal team than we have seen in a couple of
weeks, but ifwe execute, we’ll be able to take
advantage."

Even if Monmouth overpowers Grinnell,
the following two weeks of play mark the start
of a far easier second half of the season. On
Oct. 5, the Pioneers travel to Knox (L3, L2

NICK Hecxen

MWC), who they beat last year in a 35734
classic. After that, they host cellar-dweller
Lake Forest (0~4, 073 MWC) on Oct. 12.
Wins there—and maybe even an upset against
Monmouthiwill give the Pioneers two things
they’ve lacked the past two seasons: a winning
streak and upward movement in the MWC
standings.

Knox-Out

The Pioneer men's soc»
cet team has obviously found
form. The Pioneers (3-34,
270 MWC) dismantled Knox
3-5, with a flurry of goals
Wednesday and captured a
win in a 670 beatdown.

Andrew Stephenson ’10
scored twice for the Pioneers,
while four others also found
the back ot’the net.

The six goal output looks
noticeably different from the
non-conference portion of
the Pioneers season, where
the team only managed one
win in ﬁve games.

A long undefeated run to
start the conference season
isn't out of the question, ei~
thcr. The Pioneers play their
next four conference games at
home, including this Saturday,
when they host a 1:30 match
against Illinois College.
