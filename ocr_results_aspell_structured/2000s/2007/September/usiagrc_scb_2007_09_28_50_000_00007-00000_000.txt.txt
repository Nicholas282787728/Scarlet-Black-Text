Playboy and AARP: The surprising football house

try Au SARGENT

Russell K. Osgood may be the president of
Grinncll College, but seniors Ben “Sunshine"
Westfcldt, Nick Merldin, Lance Burkholder,
Ben Remington and Nathan “Grizz” Lindsey
are the ones living in the White House. And
their constitution comes with more party than
preamble.

While the residents of 1017 High Street
refer to their home as the White House, most
Gtinnellians know it simply as “football house."
Either way, it's pretty American, something
the boys have taken to heartimaking “That’s
pretty American" their house slogan. “We like
to keep things American around here," said
Lindsey. “We're pretty patriotic.”

This is probably a good time to mention
that the most important thing to remember
while visiting football house
is that “Everythiug's kind ofa ,
joke in here,"says Westfeldt.

“This house has been, rn
recent decades, primarily oc-
cupied by people who are on
the football team," said Lind-
sey. Lindsey, Mcrklin and
Westfeldt moved into 1017
High Street their sophomore
year, bringing the house back utto the hands of
the football teamwmle only five ofthe playt
ers actually live there, the house still acts as a
gathering place, hosting familytlike team get-
togethers, such as a weekly Sunday barbeque.

“We hope that five more guys can carry
on the tradition for the upcoming years," said
Merklin.

The residents promote the good of all
Grinncllians, not just their teammates. “We
like to give
away a lot of
beer and make
sure the Cole
logo is having
a good time,"
said Lindsey.

T h e y ’ r e
concerned with
the physical
welltbeing oftheir peers as well. “One time the
Health Center gave us like 400 condoms. So
we put them on a table under there and let the
general public use them," said Lindsey.

“And the next day they were like, half
gone," added Merklin,

The house is a magnet for parties, planned
and unplanned, and there is something going
on pretty mueh every Saturday during rootball
season. “Nothing’s going on on-campus, so
we go ahead and buy a keg and it turns into
a party," said Merklin. It certainly sounds like
a world of surprises, with an impromptu rap
concert being held this past weekend.

In addition to spontaneous concerts, the
residents of football house are also big on
“theme" nights, most of them sports-related,

although there is the somewhat more reﬁned
“colored tuxedo shirts night.""We like to party,
but we keep it classy," said Merklin.

Even beer pong is classy at the football
house, as all tournaments are played on their
custom-made beer pong table. “It's my baby,"
said Lindsey, looking lovingly at the table he
constructed as an exact replica of Rosenbloom
field, complete with the red and black Gtinnell
logo at centerhcld.

While the beer pong table is obviously the
hub of house social gatherings, more time is
spent in the cozy “family area" on the other
side of the room. “We’re trying to make our
living room sort ota lodge theme," said Lind-
sey. The decorating scheme is apparent—the
walls are covered in paintings, posters and
wooden replicas of birds of prey, speciﬁcally
owls. “We love to hunt and kill
animals," said Burkholder with
a smile. “Yeah, we're working
on a stuffed deer head,” added
Lindsey,

Another feature ofthc living
room is a white board, on which
the word "huttscx” stands out.
“Most of the time that board is
for who owes who money," said
Lindsey. But then drunk guests get involved,
“They usually erase all our records and write
funny anecdotes. One time someone wrote,
Hey guys, thanks for the hummust didn't
even think we had hummus in the ftidgc,l)utl
gmess they are it,"

Other than a spacious living area, house
amenities include both front and back porch-
es, a “pretty sweet” yard complete with a fire
pit, a refrigerator devoted'entirely to beer and,
last but not least, a severely dented mailbox
(caused by a ﬂying keg, thrown off the porch
by intoxicated alumni). “That’s a new tradre
tion we're starting for alumni weekend,” said
Lindsey

Each of the five guys has their own room
and while Lindsey’s includes a bathroom, the
other four guys are lett with just one to share.
“We only have one shower, which is probably
my least favorite part about the house" said
Merklin. As expected, the toilet seat was up,
next to which sat a messy stack of magazines
ineludngartiay, Playboy and AARP.

A peek into the bedrooms revealed a clear
decorating trend of sports, alcohol and women,
with the occasional cute fuzzy animal poster.
“We’re definitely animal activists,” said Mark
lin.And ofcoutsc, no cril) tour would be come
pletc without a peek into the fridge, which was
surprisingly healthy, stocked with milk, cheese,
grapes and homemade salsa.

One of the first things you notice when
walking up to football house is the sign outside
that reads “Hippies use back door. No except
trons." But there are exceptionsﬂ lot ofthem
and that's the greatest, and perhaps most unt
expected thing about football house.

“1 think that a lot at people might be int
timidated by football house" added Lindsey,
"but honestly, we try to keep it pretty open and
let anybody in that wants to come in," As for
the hippies, “We have hippies in here all the
time.”

Finally, when asked to give one adjective

describing their life at football house there
was a long pause, until finally someone asked,
“What’s an adjective?” Living in the White
House and not knowing grammatiwhat
could be more American than that?
