Women s soccer still poised
for a repeat performance
as Midwest Conference
soccer champions

BY JAI GARG

After posting the highest winning per
centagc in school history and winning its third
Midwest Conference title in the past four
years, expectations have been running high for
the women’s soccer team.

This didn't phase Gustavus Adolphus,
though. The Gusties gave Grinnell their first
loss of the year on Saturday, downing the Pio-
neers 3»1, and forcing the team to remain ope
timistic.

“The team felt like [the game] was a good
learning experience,"Miki Nakamura '10 said.
“We know that we still have a lot of work to
do.”

Gustavus Adolphus dominated throughr
out, scoring two goals in the first halfand add—

the most talented that l have ever seen.”

ing a third in the second half before Amelia
Stoker '09 ﬁnally put Grinnell on the board in
the 86th minute.

The season still looks promising for the
Pioneers. They return nine of 11 starters from
last year, and also managed to convince spear
tacular goalie Liz Carrier '07 tojoin the coach—
ing stands assistant coach, ensuring that near-
Iy all oflast year’s core will continue to play an
important role in the team’s development.

Laura McElroy '11 and Ingrid Wenner-
herg ’11 have the difﬁcult job of ﬁlling Car-
riet’s shoes. “The ﬁrsteyear goalies both look
really good," Nakamura said. “They both are
working hard and stepping up”

Along with McElroy and Wenncrherg,
Grinnells crop ofnine hrsteyears should deepe
en an already loaded team. “This year’s class of
rusteyears is one of the most talented that I
have ever seen,” midﬁelder Hannah Sayle '08
said.

The bedrock of the team is a stellar defense
led by Captain Becca Mackenzie '08, and the
team knows they have the talent to succeed,

“We expect to win Conference and ads
Wine: further into NCAA playoffs than last
year," Nakamura said.

With a trip out East this weekend to face
Bryn Mawr and swarthmore, currently ranked
seventh in the Mid-Atlantic region, the Pio-
neers will again have a chance to prove that
they can live up to expectations.

With a self descrihed "sloppy l 0 win ovcr
North Iowa Area Community College out of
the way, Gtinnell's men's soccer team began
looking tnrward to Saturdays showcase match,
wanting to pull offthe upset against nationally
ranked Gustavus Adolphus,

But they could not have foreseen the per
formance by G.A. forward Mike Butterworth.
He opened the scoring for the Gusties on a
penalty kick about 20 minutes into the first
quarter thanks to a questionable handeball
in the box. From there, he just kept on going.
Butterworth ended the day with all four of his
team's goals in a 4,0 win.

“The only real difference between the
teams was Butterworth,” said goalkeeper Sam
Lancaster ’08.

Perhaps true, but the Pioneers seemed
disorganized on the field at times, unsure of
themselves at others. “As a team we need to
be more connected from defense to offense,"
said caprain Calvin Dane'OS. “At many points
during the game, we wcrc disconnected and
playing as three separate cntiticsidefenders,
midﬁelders, and forwards."

Despite this loss, the team is optimistic
about this team's overall potential.

“With so many newcomers on the team
this year, disorganized play can be expected
rhrough the ﬁrst few games," back JP Prouty
'10 said. "We will be a machine by the time the
conference season rolls around."

Looking ahead, the Pioneers return an or
tremely talented group, led by returning All—
MWC first teamers Andrew Stephenson ’10 at
forward and Aden StinebricknereKaufmann
'08 on defense. In addition, the Pioneers also
bring back six All-MWC second teamers
along with a number of other veterans, giv-
ing the team unprecedented depth and setting
them up for a title run.

Injury, however, still holds the team back,
Sean Miller '08 noted that several starters,
including Andrew Walsh '09, Benj wagrnan
'08, Milan Popovic ’09, Parker Koester '09 and
Demetrio Rojas '09 were all out of Saturday's
gamc.“With them,we are a much more skilled
team,” said Miller.

coach Brian “Jaws" Jaworski is just eager
to be back on the pitch. “We have been eXe
cited about this season as soon as last season
ended," said Jaworski. “It was hln seeing the
Grinnell name near the top ofthe standings in
the MWC and we are going to do everything
we can to be competitive again in the confer-
ence."

But skilled enough to take on the Confer
ence? “Our conference opponents lost a lot of
talent after last season and we seem to have
brought in a lot of talent. so that's a plus for
us," says Prouty.

Lancaster is a little more direct. “We will
win conference this year. We have the talent
and the team chemistry."
