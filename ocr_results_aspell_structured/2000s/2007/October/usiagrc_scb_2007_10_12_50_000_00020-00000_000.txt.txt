Skip Day dawned bright and beautiful,
much to the delight of the Grinncll student
body Judging from the atmosphere through
out the (lily, Grinncllians felt that the timing
couldn’t liiwe been better.

Complete with three kegs in central cam-
pus, students with painted and glitter-ed taces
danced in the sun \vhllc othcr Gl'innclliaus lists
ed to students performing
music and watched the ,
antics ofvaiious members A -,
of the Student Govern-
ment Association.

Skip Day's history is
an unusual one, Accord
ing to SGA President
Jun Neideibuch, Presi-
dent A, Richard Turner initiated the event
in thc spring of1975 at his inauguration as
President. instead of the usual pompous core
einonies which accompany an inauguration,
Tumor requested that the students be given a
day off The overwhelming success orthe day
prompted the faculty, anxious to ﬁnd a way to
alleviate academic piessure, to vote to have a
skip day once a semester. Thus, Skip Day was
born with the idea orbeing as spontaneous and
unstructured as possible '

Neiderbach saitl emphatically that although
Skip Day coincided with National Armband
Day, it was totally coincidental. Interestingly,
Skip Day is never planned more than two or
three days in advance. Sunday night, Nciderr
bach decided Wednesday would he a good day.

Neidetbach‘s committee had no idea
as to whcn Skip Day would be held prior to

rumor that Skip Day

proved false. Neidcrbach

that, “them almost wasn't

The committee's goal was to keep the dayas
informal and spontaneous as possible because,

felt that the day “ran along very smoothly and

Half jealous, half buzzed

Last night, I spent the most consecutive hours
in an academic building I have all year. Where
was I, you ask? Comfortably enshrined in ARH,
that bastion oftllc social sciences? Nestled neatly
in a niche in Carnegie, leeching ctr efrhc politi»
cal science vibes to help me write my seminar par
pct? Heck no.1was in the MathLAN, up in the
heavens of Noyce, And I’m pissed because of it.
New Noyce has everything a student of any ma-
jor could ask for, including lounges stocked with
coffee, (I took some of your precious creamer. it
was glorious.) l, as a poll sci kid, have no place to
cull borne—no loung: dedicated to my major, no
24-hour access to a computer unless 1 hole up in
it first and no eollegc—ptovidcd carieine to fuel
me. Science majors, i am envious of your new
buildipg. And until political science gets a place
to call home, I have a message for you: watch
your creamer. ,
