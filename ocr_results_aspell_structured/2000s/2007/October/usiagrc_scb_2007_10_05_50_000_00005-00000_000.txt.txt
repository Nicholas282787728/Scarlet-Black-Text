The Hoax

Hard-to-like characters, but

Clifford Irving is a critically acclaimed
writer who cant scam to find success com-
mercially. Desperate, Irving marches into the
ofﬁce at Literary agent Andrea Tate and pio—
claims that he has the‘ most important book
of the century" Unfortunately for lrvirtg, he
has no clue as to what the book is going to be
about. But for director Lasse Hallstrom (Clas-
i/ar, various ABBA music videos), as pert'ect
material for his ﬁlm The Home.

Scrambling for an idea, Irving stumbles
upon the stoiy ufbillionaire Howard Hughes,

The Heart
of the Game
(2005)

Despite ﬂavvs, doc inspires

lr's always good to watch a documentary
once in a while. They provide a nice change
ofpacc from the often overwrought, expensive
and ﬂashy movies that dominate the screen
now1dnys. TIM Hem! aft/w Game, which fol-
lows six ycais inn 1Scattlc— based girls basket—
ball team, has wh1t m1kcs documentaries so
enticing; authenticity. Yet this quality, while
the movie‘s' greatest strength, is also its greatest
liability.

The doeuincnury's realism derives from
the players followed and the difﬁculties they
race These problems range hem teenagers
(a ing to follow directions in a game, pro-
gressing to more serious issues like seaaial
abuse and teen pregnancy The players" ability
to overcome their adversities makes them all
the more poignant. The story, though, is not
without a lighter side. as their inspiringcoach
Bill Resler demonstrates. And the heart ofthe
movie exists in the moving story at p'ersistcnt
and ultimately successful Dntnellia Russell.

But the enormous story the movie tries to
tell bogs it down. Over the course of six years
the team plays many games, but only a handful
are of vital importance The reality of srnig-
gling to a championship vame can be wearing
to any audience who Just wants to see the final
few minutes of the last game. And Darnellia’s
appearance in the second year changes the to-
cus ofthe movie entirely, so that the previously
documented footage is foigotten in lieu ofthis

Wed. folk extravaganza: music at Bob’s and Saints Rest

Drinking coffee at Saints Rest, one sonic-
times gets the feeling of foreign lands, staring
at photos of distant countries on the wall. But
on Wednesday, latte lovers may feel as if they
have been transported to 19th-century Ameri-
ca when Ben Bedford plays at Saint’s Rest.

Bedford is a singer/songwriter from
Springﬁeld, 111. He writes simple folk songs,
his voice and guitar work taking center stage
with minimal backing instrumentation. His
voice is not particularly inspiring and the
gniitar in his songs is pretty standard folk fare
with only a little country twang added to make
things interesting. His songs create a mellow
and relaiting atmosphere, which can either be
pleasant to listen to or put you to sleep with
the repetitive song structure.

Bedford is touring tor his newly released
album Lima/iii Man. This is his second i117

music may leave something to he desired, his
songs compensate with interesting narrative
lyrics. Bedford's songs generally t‘ollowa story
or specific character. His History degree from
the University of Illinois at UtbnnaVCl’lam’
paign probably ctplains his focus on telling
stories from l9rh. and early 20th-century
America,

On Lincolns Man, " the title track of his
new album, Bedford tells a story or a young
man yotnmg the Union Army in the Civil War,
despite the protests of his southern family.
The setting ofthc Civil War is used again in
“Virginia Girls," the best song on the new al.
bum. on the song “Migrant Mother,” named
for Dorothea Langc's famous photo, Bedford
weaves a tale about life for this woman in the
Gicar Depression.
