No limits? Not at Grinnell.

incorporate alcohol orientation into future NSO programming

Grinnell is pleasantly wet

Of course, “wet" refers to drugs and alcohol.
Thanks to self~governance, it’s particularly easy to
help students when they misjudge their own limi—
tations. But how do we expect them to know their
limits in the first place?

Prc-Grinncll, most students {all into two cat-
egories: being substance-
free in high school, or
getting drunk at secret
parties in someone‘s base»
ment. Grinnell offers new
students a similar di»
chotomy: substance-fret
housing with a supportive
community of uppersclass
mentors, or the comparativcly unguided world of
pressubsrancc housing. NSO might be an effective
way to bridge the divide. Yet NSO offers firstryears
virtually no gridelines on healthy alcohol use.

Grinnell is behind the times. Based on infor-
mal interviews of transfetstudents, we discovered
many schools offer specific orientation on alcohol.

Wellesley, a virtually dry campus, offers skits
showing what to do when someone might have
alcohol poisoning. The University of Minnesota
has students WICl’] a video on alcohol and then
leads discussion on the topic. Macalestcr and the
University of Christian Brothers both offer events
about drinking on campus and how much is too
much. And Wesleyan has a speaker come in and
do an entertaining, popular and informative two
hour performance. These events focus on how
many drinks is too much, how and when to call
for help and how to tell if someones drinking is

getting out of control.

Informational sessions during Nso might
combat some of the more warped ideas that Stun
dents can acquire through the Gtinnellparty scene.
Blackouts are not healthy and should not happen.
Neither should throwing up, More than four shots
of hard alcohol is too much. While students will
still drink, and some will
drink too much, the college
should at least offer some
guidelines about healthy
drinking behavior.

Selfrgovernance dc-
pendsoninformedstudcnts.
Armed with information,
we can choose what risks
to take. But without some basic guidelines, some
students may take bigger chances than they mean
to. Before they figure out their limitations, some
students spend many nights their first year cliiige
ing to a toilet Basic informarion and rules~such
as when and how to call an RLC—would offer
a foundation of knowledge. From there, we have
to rely on students to make their own decisions,
regarding or disregarding the information at will.
That’s what self-governance is all aboutr

As the committee plans next year's NSO, they
ought to provide some sort of speaker or event
regarding alcohol. if there's not room, knock off .
something else. Maybe we should shorten the
medal ceremony. in any case, we need to make
room for alcohol education. After all, NSO teach-
es students about self-goveriiance, but self-gov-
ernance is of little use ifwc cannot give students
some guidelines on how to go about it.

whyI initially chose to dedicate four
youthful years to a twosblock campus
in Iowa. First, let me complain. In my
time on campus,l’ve continually gripcd
about how Grinnell’s practices do not
fit wtth my vision ofan ideal socialjus-
tice institution. Funding is too limited,

too many service opportunities focus
on the outside although there is a lot
of need in town and Grinnell corps
limits graduates to six presselected
programs. Chaplain Deanna Shorb has
done an excellentjob, but throwing the
entire community
