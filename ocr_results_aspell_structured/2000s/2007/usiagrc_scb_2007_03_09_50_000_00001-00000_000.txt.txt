Dartmouth
nominates Crady
for Dean position

The nomination does not constitute
an official offer. Crady, Vice Presi-
dent of Student Services, says he is
still'undecided about the job. .

Ev CHRIS NEUBERT

After 25 years otunparallclcd inﬂuence at Gtinnell, Vice
President roi- student scrvices Torn ciady has become an in-
stitution within the administration. Beginning his career as an
RLC in 1982, Cindy moved bctwccn Studcnt Affairs and Ad
missions before ultimately settling into his current position,

Crady‘s success at Grinnell has attracted the attention of of
ficials at Dartmouth College, wlieie Crady was recently nomi—
nated tor the Dean orthc collcgc position. Attcr a quarter-
century stny.Tom crarly might be leaving GrInnclL

Cnidy stresses that he has simply been nominated for and
not yet offered the positron. He has also not made a decision
about whether he would accept the position if offered.

“Therc’s a grearcr magnitude of responsibility,” Cindy said
ofthe job offer. “It's important to determine irit would he rhc
right fit."

If Crady were to become Dartmouth’s new Dean, he would
be responsible for a start of 500 and a budget of 570 million.
“It’s a whole different world," Ci'ady said,

According to SGA Vlcc President Michael Billups ’07,
were Crady to 1eave,rhe college would be left with a sIgniﬁczint
“vacuum" to be ﬁlled. “Student Affairs would be In a tenuous
place,” Billiips said. “It’s a situation they would rather not be
in.” President Russell
Osgood also stressed
that he does not want
to sce Crady go, but
said, “If other people
aren’t trying to get him,
we're not doing ourjob
right."

Since Osgood has
been president, only
one administrator, Jon-
athan Brand, former
Vice President for Institutional and Budget Planning, has left
Grinnell.

This is not because administrators are not receiving other
offers and, in fact, Osgood said that senior administrators are
typically approached four or five times every year. He said that
many choose to stay at Grinncll because of the great sense of
community that the college fosters. "This is a place with a
strong sense of mission," Osgood said,“There is a strong sense
of what this place is about."

Still, Osgood added that when administrators are ap-
proached with serious offers, “it is important to try and assess
where they want to go professionally." Accordingly, Osgood is
involved in an ongoing conversation that involves him, Crady,
Crady's family and Dartmouth,

While Dartmouth has yet to give a definitive answer, Crady
said that ”opinion at home varies greatly” and added that with
two sons enrolled in Griimcll public schools, it was esscntial to
consider any move “from a family perspective,"

Whatever the outcome, both Billups and Osgood agreed
that his work at Grinnell has been invaluable. “Hes terrific,"
Osgood said. He has good Judgment works hard, is steady in a
crisis and a pleasure to work with.

Billups was also quick to praise Crady, and said that SGA
has a great relationship with him. According to Billups, crady
is the “most responsive" administrator he has worked with.

Were he to leave, Billups said, it would be difficult to ﬁnd
someone as “excellent and committed to following through"on
student concerns.

”There’s a greater magnitude of
responsibility it imporlam to
determine ifii would be the right
ﬁt. ”

Tom Crady,
\ﬁce President of Student Services

he said. [But then] 1 met Anna Gilbert Luongs experience
suggests that among campaign tactics, canvassing trumps all,

At first, Luong said he was most impressed with a poster
outside of Loose hall promoting the presidential candidacy or
Megan Goering'osxsm had like a yatdrbyryatd srpiare potter.

Despirc the inagnimde
News Analysts or the poster and the other
campaigns, Luong cast his
vote for SGA president for Anna Gilbert '09 because, he said,
she was the only candidate With whom he had any peisoiial
inteiacrion and that she left a positive impression on him.

“I'm sure in had met Megan Gearing, she would have had
an equal shot," he said. Other students cchoed this sentiment,
saying they voted for candidates whom they met personally.

The race for president was not the only one inﬂuenced by
personal campaigning. Jan Koszcwsici’og a Joint Board Senator
who visited almost cvcry dorm on campus, defeated his oppo-
nent and roommate Nick Blencowc '08, though Blencowe had
spent this year on the SGA Cabinet as Administrative Coors

For current SGA
Vice Piesidcnt Michael
Billiips '07, canvassing,
while powerful, should
be used In moderation.
“One, you're not gonna
be able to do it [too
much] lInd stay sane,”
Billups said. “Two, you're gonna turn on a lor otpcoplc.“ Bil-
[ups also said it was important not to emphasize canvassing
over postering.

Ambitious campaigning, however, proved insufﬁcicnl in
overcoming some cleeroral handicaps as the clcction's two
prominent Wtite1n candidates, Amanda Spiegcl ‘09 who ran
fol Vice President of Student Affairs, and Ian BoIieeRundle

Three arrested while protesting war

Brian Perbix 09 spent
