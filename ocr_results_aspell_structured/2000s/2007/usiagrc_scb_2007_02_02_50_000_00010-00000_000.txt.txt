, Brooklyn, Iowa might be any other
small town in Iowa, in this time when
small towns are forgotten or at least
ignored. Except for the ‘Community of
Flags‘, a homemade tourist attraction, and
the fact that my friend, Liza Newman ’08,
loves it.

Last Saturday we pulled into Brooklyn and Liza put an
opera song—“1e Crois Entendre Encore”—on her car stereo.
I don’t know much about opera, but Iiearing the ostentatious,
booming, cultured voiees as these almost empty, snow-covered
plots othilly farmland gave way to humble Brooklyn made me
imagine that the town seemed to want to be so much more than
what it was, or ever could be. Opera was not written for towns
like Brooklyn. Opera doesn't even know that towns like Brooke
lyn exist, Acrually,1 lied. Brooklyn used to have an opera house,
of its own, but it closed a long time ago. We pulled up to the
city’s number one remaining tourisrartraction, rhc‘Community
of Flags’ and stepped out into the cold wind. Further down {he
streerwas Brooklyn’s small commercial district, Grain elevators
dominated the squat horizon.

Liza comes here about once a month, sometimes to “wallow
in sadness" while she listens to Neil Young songs and looks at
rhe abandoned buildings, But mostly she
comes out here when she’s stressed out at
school and needs to get away. It seems a
good enough place to get away. Grinneli,
perhaps, might not even exist.

Thc‘Community ofFlags’is a path on
the outside of Brooklyn’s small business
district, lined on either side with all ﬁfty
state ﬂags. At the end of the path ﬂies one
of those us. tiags so massive it’s almost
obscene—20 by 38 feet. The ﬂag ﬂew at
halfemast in honor of the late President
Ford, which made the whole monument look shrunken. The
ﬂags tiapped m the strong wind and sounded like a bunch of
angry birds,or a continuous hum oftliunder. Only a couple sets
orthorpriats were left in the days-old, crunchy snow.

We hid from the cold in a dim used bookstore down the
street, Slightly Read Books. onc5 of musty paperbacks were
scattered across the ﬂoor, and the whole shop felt dogeeared and
second—hand. It turned out that store used to be in Grinncll,
next door to the Strand Theater, until the building's roof co],
lapsed in 2000 and the owner, Ms. Himes, was forced to move
to Brooklyn, Her business used to be booming, she loved talk-
ing with Grinnell students,

But now, her store is mostly empty. She doesn't even have
enough shelrspaee to store all her books. While she tells me
and Liza this story, she smiles.

We then popped next door to the Community of Flags
store. They sold postcards, memorabilia, and ﬂags, of course,
but the bulk of the store was an odd grabebag of secondhand
chinlz. I found old belts,a coffccemakcrm rusty bingo machine,
a set of knives, a book called Dare to a: Dull, honey, a jar of
commemorative gourmet Brooklyn Community of Flags pope

corn on sale for a little more than five dollars. It seemed that
Brooklyn's whole commercial sector was based on the sale and
resale ofsecondrliand knickeknacks, that the town collected its
citizens’morc useﬁil trash and sold it back to itself.

We left the souvenir store and headed into the True Value
hardvlmre store, where we met the elder statesman of Brooklyn,
Rusty, a gentle, well-spoken man who has been selling hard
ware in Brooklyn for 33 years and who knows pretty much
everything that’s going on in the city He told us the rather dis-
appointing story of how Brooklyn proclaimed itself the Com-
munity of Flags.

When the Regirzrr's Annual Bike Ride Across Iowa
(RAGBRAl) came through Brooklyn in 1991 “we were look
ing at a way to stop the riders. We put up arty ﬂags as they
came into town and that stopped them. We were looking tor
a tourism niche, and decided it would be ﬂags."A Brooklynire
designed the display, and the town collected money for it, We
charted a bit more about how Brooklyn has changed over the
years: it has fewel inom-and-pop shops, a bigger medical clinic.
and a new high schoolwe stopped talking because Rusty had
to go help a customer. Liza and 1 looked at the different paint
colors and argued about which we liked best,

We then went to the new bar and grill across the street
because its sign sported a picture of a cow eating a pig, The
sign also proclaimed the name of the bar: Rednex. The build
ing had a conspicuous lack ofwllidows. we
went down a dim set ofstairs into a spacious,
clean room with a big-screen TV and lots ot
wood paneling, We charred with the owner

those touch-screen gambling games, barely
acknowledging us. Rednex had just opened.
he told us, and will start serving food around
Valentine's Day. He asked us ifwc knew any-
one who might help bartcnd

Rednex’s neighbor, the Point Street True
era, was a smoky, homey bar which also did
not have any windows. At a central, circular table about SIX old
men sat at a game ofcards it teir like rhey never letr, and the
bartender told us,yes, the same men came and sat most days.

They didn't seem to notice us, but] felt selﬂeonscious that
rhcy would immediately recognize as t‘or what we were (rakes.
trespassers),Tlre bartender was terribly nice, though'l'he come
mumry was quite tight. Thar night the bar would host a blltlr
day party for six of the town's most festive citizens.le crowd,
we were told, was expected to stretch out the door.

We then drove back home, to Grinnell. A thick snow started
to fall and the rolling tarms filled quickly with a field ofwliite.

I was disappointed with myself. I knew that my friend felt
a deep connection with this place, and while 1 could appreci-
ate the town With her, I hadn’t been particularly charming, or
entertaining. Later that night, however,l overheard Liza telling
some friends about our trip to Brooklyn.

“one orrhe best Brooklyn trips everl" she said. i was sure
prised. i asked her why “Well, i talked to people instead of
just going there with these romantic intentions ofgoing to a
ghost town," she explained, “It made it more ream thought
about this. When we first came into Brooklyn, I thought ofit

as little more than a depressed gimmick. Brooklyn was trying
really hard to not be just another small Iowa town, but it looked
even smaller, even more Iowa. But then I got to thinking about
it, and the people in Brooklyn were nice, earnest. Sure, to a
higl-rfalutin, cityrboy like me, it seems like they had a bad idea.
But they took that ﬂag and ran with it, ,
