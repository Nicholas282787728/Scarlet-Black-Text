Forget domestic politics and try foreign flavors

She’s fired up

I have a confession to make: I spent most oflast
fall‘s political season on the couch, watching Carri-
edy Central. I made it to a few Campus Dcrrrs mccl-
ings, but 1 Mai volunteer. Coldccdlllng strangers and
knocking on doors? No thanks This year. though, I'll
caucus for Bal'a Ohama.

Why Obamaﬂ like politicians I can trust. Obama
has an inconvenient habit of telling people what they
don't want to hour. It's lousy for his carnpaign.That’s
why I bclicic ivhat Obama says. In Detroit, Obania
talked about an unpopulai siibjecr—tucl economy
standardsr He refused to pander to his audience

Lately, ir's fashionable ro refuse lobbyisr money.
Ohama has made that pledge, but he's hardly new to
ethical politics. In the Illinois State Senate, he worked
on the first ethics reform bill in over 29ycars, Ifwe
want to make progress on healthcare and energy m,
form, we need a president who owes big lobbyists
nothing. Obania will he that president.

If you see me sitting at a table outside the dining
hall,1'in probably freaking out over having to recruit
strangers But I'll be there. I'll go to rallies and scream

“Fired up!" And corneianuaryJ'lI fly back to Gr'innell‘

a weck early and caucus for Biir'ack Obama. I invrtc

you all to join me. After all, how many chances will
you have ro choose an honest president?
iNﬂIﬂ Calm '10

No theatrics

In response to last week’s aiticle about my “abiupt’
departure frorn thc Theatre and Dance Dcpartmcnt,l
am wiiring ro correct some misinformation.

lﬁrsr,l raughr ar Grinncll for eighr years, not scvs
en, and my pi-csenr academic leave is my ninth year
at Gr-rnncll. The article inferred through a student's
statement that I was not involved iii scholarship. This
statement is misleading The creative professional
woik ofﬂiciilry artists that is presented off campus is
evaluated as scholarship.

I also want it known that any of the “wild rumors"
which implicate me in unerhiciil behavior are wholly
inaccurare. President Osgood did nor decide my tenure
status until May 10, 2007, due [0 a set of procedural
and ethical abuses in the review process tllat continr
tied over several years. Due to binding confidentiality,
i am not pcrmirterl to divulge the speClﬁC factors that
led to these events. The cloak of confidentiality has
protected those who should be punished and has pun-
ished those who should have been pioreercd.

First off, I owe Mother- Nature an
apology. You sec, not two days after
the publication of my first column. I
was accosted by a squirrel as l walked
home. There was a steely glint in its
eyes, eyes rhat said, “Sir,I read your ill—
informed opinion of the genus Vadmlirt
and, well, the upshor otit is I’m going
to rip out your jugular." With that, the
vicious varrninr lunged ar what i guess
he thought was myjugular but in actur
ality was my big toe. Needless to say,I
survived this harrowing encounter. But
I hereby extend an apology ro Mother
Nature: I thought I'd seen real nature
during my. childhood days abroad, I’ve
learned my lesson. Please, don't hurt me
anymore.

On to more pressing matters.To my
unpracriccd eye, it appears that politics
is die newest fad nowadays here in rhe
states. as opposed to last year when
some old white men were voted out in
favor of other old white men. Or the
year before that, when all the old white
men were campaigning ro srop other
old white men from taking their job.

Excuse me if I'm not feeling the
electricity in the air, but I just find it
all so boring. The speeches are all
tired rhetoric; all of the candidates go
to the same old places to do the same
old things. Even the campaign rallies
here are dull; ir's just a bunch of soc-

aren't going to be genurnely interested
in poliries, we miglir as well pub in
some feigned interest, right?

Feigned interest is basically all I
practice nowadays. It seems every other
day somebody comes up to me to tell
me about some politician who’s run-
ning a grassroots (read: unpopular)
campaign and how 1 should really really
vore for him because he's very very paSc
sionate about my, Kevin Marcou’s, per
sonal concerns. I think his name is Bill

or Ted or

something
equally for
go r r a b l e,
Sure, I
could vote
“ for whom-
ever it is
the overlyc
excited guy is telling to votc focl am
an American citizen, even if] hail from
foreign chines, and it is technically my
civic dirty as such to at least give lip SCI-
viee ro rhe government

Bur rhere‘s just soincrhing about
the way these guys jiisr swarin. Thcy
remind me ii lot ot'Ncw Zealand. No.
I‘m not talking about New Zealandcrs'
unnerving “familiarity"wlth wooly rob
drier. I'm referring to the insects that
I endearingly named “Nostril Flies."
As you miglir expect, Nostril Flies are

pure evil incarnate.They are sent by the
Devil himself ro torrure any poor soul
who dares step into the lush wilderness
ofNew Zealand. It seems the one goal
in their short lives was to make my life
as miserable as possible, mostly by try-
ing to enter every oriﬁce on my face.
Like kamikaze bombers, they happily
swarmed abour my face, ettectivcly ob-
scuring my vision before rliey plunged
themselves into my ears, my mouth and
up my nose, all for the glory ofpooping
out some bacterium on me before they
kicked the bucket (or whatever it is that
ﬂies do to buckers when they die).Yeah,
that’s basically howl saw those politi-
cal operatives. And it’ll be a cold day in
hell before I support a candidate who
employs Nostril Flies.

How then do we invigorate the
lazy American elecroratc, symbolized
by myself? How do we galvanize the
gawkers? How do wc ﬂrc up the fecunr
dity ofpolitical thought?

Let‘s look at it rhis way' what do
Americans like? it television is any
indicarioii, rhey like reality TV shows.
Thei-ctorc, l propose we maroon all
presidential candidates on an island
and let them duke i out, to the death,
until one emerges king ofthe island.

That would cerrainly invigorate this
sparkling erample of the American
electorate.
