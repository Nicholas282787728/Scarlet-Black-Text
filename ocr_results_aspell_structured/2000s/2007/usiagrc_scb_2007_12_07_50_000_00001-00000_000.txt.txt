Security finalizes
camera policy

or SARAH CASSON

students have long been uneasy about the presence ofvideo
surveillance on campus, but for several years multiple parties
have installed cameras without the explicit consent or knowle
edge or Security, A new policy created by security, howevei,
hopes to regulate the use orsurveillance cameras while protects
ing students’ right to privacy

The new Camera Policy proposal,which has yet to be ﬁnal~
ized, would regulate who will be allowed to install new cameras,
and provides strict measures for the use ofany material that is
recorded. At thc moment, Security does not operate any came
eras on campus. Other parties, however, have set up at least
three security cameras, though Head ofSecurity Steve Briscoe
said he is uncertain where those cameras are located.With this
proposal, those parties wanting to put up cameras will have to
go through certain steps in order to do so and will be accounts
able to Security.

Brrscoe stressed that this policy is being considered to give
students more input in
camera usage around
campus. “In case at
some point [security]
decide[s] to put cameras
in the area that we're
having a lot of thefts or
we’re having pioblems,"
said Briscoe. The policy
“would give people a chance to say ‘I don't want that camera
(here. I don’t think it should be there.m

SGA Vice President of Student Affairs Jan Kaszewski ’08,
said he fully supports the new regulations. “This policy is most-
ly a preventive measure, so that if somebody wants to put up a
camera they must go through certain steps," he said. "As otnow,
anyone can put up a Camem."

Loosehend Senator Laura Lienemunn '08, a member of the
safety and security committee, reiterated this point in an email
to students. “Without the policy on the books, people can pret-
ty much do anything they want with cameras on campus, and
students don’t have any protections,” she said. “This isn’t neces-
sarily a policy that will put in cameras, but rather a policy that
will make sure there is oversight if someone puts in a camera.”

But some students are still uncertain about the cameras.
“What happens if the cameras catch something that they
weren‘t originally intended to catch?” asked Kati Queen ’11.

Briscoe and Security are alive to that possibility, but suggest
that small, victimlcss crimes would not be reported.

For Licnemann student involvcmcnt in the regulation pro—
cess is key to preventing student fears and confusion. “They
could just put this policy into effect right now without any
changes,” Lienemann wrote. “Briscoe wants to make sure this
is something that students are comfortable wrth, that they feel

When (tentative):
Mon., 4:30 pm.

”This polity/5 mostly a preven-
tative measure As (if/low,
anyone can put up a camera.”

Search on for graduation speaker

Commencement committee struggles with scheduling, funding and faculty

BV SARAH MlRK

Despite racing obstacles ranging from funding to schedule
ing conﬂicts, the Student Commencement Committee is still
searching for the perfect graduation speaker. After creating an
initial list of potential speakers last spring, the committee has
now bcgnm to reconsider their options after being turned down
by three candidates.

While the college has increased the amount of money pres
scntcd to speakers from $12,000 to $15,000 over the past three
years, big name potentials request upwards of 330,000 for the
less than hour-long talk. The honorarium is low, explains Vice
President of college and Alumni Relations Mickey Manley
'87, because it is supposed to be. “it's long been held that (re
nances shouldn‘t be the inducement, incentive or sole remrd
for a spenkcr,”Munlcy said.

But committee member Nora Skelly ’08 said, having more
money [0 offer “deﬁnitely wouldn’t hurt” the school's chances of
snagging a memoi able speaker.

“It’s a conundrum,” said Munley. “On the one hand. well,
we haven’t done so bad. On the other, well,we’re Grinnell.We
want to have a wonderful commencement speaker, why lct cost
be an issue?”

"Only in the last rewyeais has it really been an issue," noted
Committee Cordinator and Director of Conference Operae
tions Rachel Bly’93, referring to the high honoraria requested
by top-pick speakers. The major hurdle to acquiring the per-
rect giadurition speaker is often scheduling difficultiesThe top
three individuals chosen last spring by the student committee
as desired speakersiNelson Mandela, Madeleine Albright and
Anna Qirndleniall turned down the offer.

A similar situation happened two years ago, when former
Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack spoke at graduation. After being
turned down by several candidates, the committe reevaluated
their list and chose Vilsock based on hrs availability and cone
nection to the campus. Current frontrrunners in the selection
process are writers like David Foster Wallace and Garrison
Keillor, political cartoonist Gary Trudeau and actor and dis
abilities activist Michael J. Fox. “We want to have someone
who would have relevant things to say,”said Skelly.

The process for choosing a speaker begins with the 1045
student Commencement Committee. a volunteer committee
which biainstorms possible speakers a year in advance. Once
the students settle on their top choices, a threcrmembcr faculty
committee and President Russell K. Osgood review the merits
orthe speakers and the entire faculty votes on whether or not
they would agree to award the speakers an honorary degree.

lrthe majority of faculty or Osgood vote against awarding
an honorary degree to the individual, the student committee
usually ntxes them from their list. This year, potential speakers
such as Aaron McGruder and Emma Thompson have becn te-
jeeted by the faculty Honorary Degree committee or Osgood.
However, as Bly emphasized, the vote is not binding and the
whole process is meant to be a “truly consensual, collaborative
discussion" about who would best represent Grinnell and offer
graduates some insight.

“The ideas deﬁnitely originate with the students," said
Skelly, who feels faculty aren’t involved in the conversation
about who to bring until their up or down vote on the honorary
degreeThough Skelly added, “We want to make sure we pick
candidates who are okay with everyone.”
