Grinnell Basketball: More than just the John Grotberg Show

John Grotberg's scoring prowess has carncd him counte
less accolades. His 4oeplus point outbursts and buzzereheate
ing heroics consistently headline 5&1} basketball articles and
have made him the most well—known athlete on campus. His
31 points per game scoring average draws national attention,
even garnering a preseason all~America nod from those people
who have nothing better to do at DSHoopsrcom.

On the surface, it seems logical. Who can argue with 31
points per game? A closer look at
Grotberg’s stats, though, reveals
that while his ability to wow the
crowd remains as strong as ever, he
is more of a liability than anyone
thinks, Nearly every game, Grot—
berg plays like a loose cannon. He
has trouble passing the ball, some-
thing few would expect from a star player. This ‘shoot firsr, pass
Iater’ playing style gets Grotberg points, but deprives valuable
role players like Trek Langenhan and Mike Schmidt along with
more consistent point guard David Arsenault of the respect
(and scoring opportunities) that they deserve.

One of the best ways to determine who’s currently playing
great system ball and who’s just throwing up crap is through
offensive efﬁciency. Sure, Coach Arsenault tells the Grinnell
offense that they should shoot within 12 seconds, but the best
players will ensure that their quick shot might actually go in.

What’s more beneﬁcial, a layup after 15 seconds, or an ugly
looking three-pointer after ﬁve? With that in mind, I looked
at how many points each player scored per field goal arrernpt,a

statistic referred to as Points Per Shot. or PPS, Out of the seven'

players who average more than 3 points per game, Grotberg is a
discouraging sixth. lfwingmen like Schmidt or Langenhan ac—

tually got to the free throw line (their wing position keeps this-

from happening too often), Grotberg could be lasr. so while
Grorhcrg leads the ream in scoring,
he has the toughest time getting
shots to fall (especially those of?-
balance, 25~foot fadeawnys), usually
leaving 40% three-point shooters
like Schmidt and Langcnhan waire
ing in the corners empryehanded,

, Grotberg’s style or play also ex—
poses his uninspiring abilities as a point guard, revealing just
how valuable David Arsenault is to this team. As the team‘s
leader in assists with 8.5 per game (almost as much as the rest
of the team combined),Arsenault represents the most troubling
force on the ﬂoor. His ablliry to drive calmly toward the hoop,
draw in the defense, and dish it out for a typically wide open
three keeps the defense eonsrandy guessing, especially since
he might also challenge the basket and get a high-percentage
shot near the hoop. Contrast this with Grotberg’s ‘drive, don't
pass, ﬂail wildly, throw up a shot, pray for a four philosophy for

a ’09

when he gets stuck inside the atc.Then factor in the assistsms
turnover rarios ofhoth players (Arsenault's is around 3:1 while
Grotberg's is slighrly less than 1:1). In all, Grinnell’s headline-
grabber and shooting wunderkind has shown a startling ability
to do little else than shoot, And shoot a lot.

Now, I admit, I probably have been a bit (00 hard on Grote
bergr Anyone who can score 30 points a game against a variety
ofdefensive schemes that often target him in planning deserves
credit, But, like any player, he is not without his ﬂaws, and
they should not be forgotten in favor of idolizing his ability to
score 43 points by taking 30 shors (lastTucsday‘s performance
against Monmourh). I would her that most of the key players
on this team could score 43 if the offense could get them 30
shots a game.

Contrary to popular belief, the best players in sysrem ball
don't have to lead the nation in scoring or marvel us with long
range three pointers (and conversely, long range airhalls). In
this weekend's crirical conference games, the key to Grinnell
wins will nor lie in whether our best players take 30 or 40 three-
pointers, but instead in whether every player can realize that
looking for an open shot should go hand-inhand with taking
a quick one.
