Services Tom Ctady, it has been an issue for
years.“lr‘r usually an issue that kind ofrumbles
around subsurface,” he said. But now some stu-
dents and faculty members are trying to bring
it to light so it can finally he settlcd.

Ben l-loworr '09 is circulating a petition
that calls on the administration to set aside a
space for studentstun music groups. Howort
said that he would like to start a campus band,
hut has been unable to do so because arranging
a time and place to practice is so difficult, He
would like to sce a permanent space With stor
age room tliatwould be available for musicians
24 hours per day, and ideally located “sonic-
where on campus that's not a dorm,"

Howort is aiming for over 700 signatures,
which would be the number ofvotes required
for a student initiative to pass. He has collected
400 signatures so far, but does not know how
many have been collected by the rivc other Suﬁ
dents circulating the petition,

Students are not alone in their call for
practice space. Last semester, the faculty of
the music department drafted a proposal’with
similar requests.

Jennifer Brown, Music, the professor
who started the proposal, was inspired not
hy a campus rock band, but by the G-Tones,
for which she serves as faculty sponsor. The
acappclla group had been reduced to holding
practice sessions in the rotunda of Bucksbaum
because all of the available practice rooms were
too small.

Brown said the music department has sufr
feted from a shortage of space for years, It is
difficult even for faculty/sled ensembles to
schedule rooms, and student-led ensembles
like GrinneLl Independent Musical Product
tions, Vox and GcToncs were often left out in
the cold or forced to use spaces too small to be
practical.

Students, faculty request adequate practice space

If the Music Department helped secure “a
room that's well-equipped and dcdicatcd to
student-tun musical ensembles," Brown said,
“that would be a way of the Music Depart-
ment showing ltow much we value this kind of

roots student involvement in music-mak-
.and not continue this sort ofsquabbling
over our space.

The criteria laid out by the music faculty
are a little more fﬂr’iﬁﬂclnng than the student
petition, and include school-purchased equip-
ment such as ampliﬁers and relatively incapcir
slvc recording equipment. Idcally. it would be
suitable for all musical groups, from campus
rock bands to jazz bands to singers.

The plaposttl, however, was never oilicially
submitted to the administration. It was set
aside after discussions hctwccn Dean for Stir
dent Life Michael Sims and Music Depart
ment Chair Gene Gaub, in which Sims said
that the spaces in the basement ofthe campus
center—the space that had hcen targctcd by
the proposnliwctc no longer available, Brown
said that the dialogue is still continuing, and
she believes thai the administration is open to
finding a solution through further discussion,

But according to crady, the Status ofsomc
of the basement shell space is still somewhat
up in the air. There is a large cement room
in the basement of the JRC about the size of
Bob’s Underground, which the construction
companies have been using to store thcir tools.
The space should be opcn within the next few
weeks, A storage room is located next door.

Crady said that this space could he used
by student-run musical groups as soon as thc
tools are cleared out until at least the end of
the semester. Many students would like to see
that area turned into a campus pub. Ctady isn’t
sure how long it would take to work out all of
the logistics, hut ifthe pub moves in, the cam-
pus bands will have to clear out.

While the search for practice space contin-
ues, some students are turning to more inder
pendent solutions. Chatlic Smith ‘07 decided
to live off campus this year with other student
musicians so that they can use their house as a
practice space. Members of Vegetable Medley
have been forninate enough to bc fricnds with
the last two ovcrnight Host Coordinators,
who have an unusually large room in Read
which they have used for practices,

Smith thinks it’s unfortunate for everyone
that the lack of practice spacc~aiid, in his
opinion, lack ofstudcnt leadership in the came
pus hand sceneihave led to what he sees as a
decline in musical activityon campus.“lrevery
student had access to a place whetc rhcy could
play music and create it and record it," hc said,
“the musical productivcncss of people would
s ’rOCkCI And I kind of feel that I have been
left out ofthat."
