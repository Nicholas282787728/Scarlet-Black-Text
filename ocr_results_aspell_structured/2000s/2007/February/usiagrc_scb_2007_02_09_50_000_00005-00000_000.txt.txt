{Conli/uwr/fr'am Pg. 1)

seven years ago, Grinnell hired Leonid
"Lyonya" lvanov, a native Russian, as its Media
and Web Coordinator. During his own college
da ,iiranovwas a memberofthe underground
res lancc to the communist regime, Non/Jua-
nov believes that the internet can be seen as an
anarchist experiment, a vast society liberated
from centralized control, lcplcte with all of the
fiecdoin and chaos that would exist in a real
lite stateless society The Glinnell website was
designed with the same emphasis on freedom
in mind.

Although his job title might paint him as
the powerful overlord of Grinnell's website,
lvanov controls relatively few of the pages on
it. or the 11,000 pages that make up the site,
lvanov only oversees the very top layers. The
rest fall under the domain onOO or so departs
mental secretaries and other page designers
who operate independently These managers
are tree to design their pages however they
want thanks to a content management system,
Born Free, that Ivanov himself designed.

Born Free, so-called because it was de-
signed and created independcnrly by Grinnell
programmers, was cuttiiigrcdgc at the time
that it was written, when few other colleges
had content management systems. Its function
is relatively simple: to allow different useis to
easily create a useful website with a couple of
standard features. That means departments
and students can easily design unique, exciting
websites full of rich content.

Unfortunately, as lvanov explains, the realr
ity doesn't match the ideal. “Most people arc
busy so they just say save," so many of the
pages on the Giinnell site use identical (Cmr
plates. This makes parts of the site, in a word,
boring.

ivanov uses an analogy from his college
days to explain the importance of content
over technology, once, he and other members
of his radical student group, with a little help
from some Chilean refugees ﬂeeing Prnochct's
regime, hatched a plan to print flyers protests
ing the Communist regime. They had the

' technology. They had a plan of how to make

and distribute them, lropehrlly without getting
caught and landing in Soviet prisons.

What they didn't have was anything to
write. After some consideration, lvanov decide
ed that the only thing he’d be Willlng to go to
jail for printing‘was an essay about “The Anart
chist Prince" Peter Kropotkin’s theories ofself-

help in animal seeictics. in the end, the group
dropped the idea because they couldn't agree
on what to write They had the means,but the
Content just wasn't there. And thus, a website
without the right information is a waste.

Thele is some debate over what kind of
content Giinncll’s website should have. Some
adininistratois want a slicker, coiporate—csque
webpage that would essentially advertise the
college, But Ivanov knows where he stands.
“l firmly believe that the main purpose or the
web pag 's to represent the lift: of the come
munity as it is," he said. .

Donna Dralus '89, lvaliov's assistant and
one of the people who decides what goes on
the front page, said that knowmg what’s hllp’
pening on campus is important not only for
students, but for alums like herself, as well as
for prospective students and students family
members.

“I can't imagine realistically getting sourc-
thing we wouldn't post,"slrc said. Both lvanov
and Dralus say they can't remember a single
instance where anything on the website has
been censored, even though the college res
serves the light to do so.

But right now, the website is being iewrit—
ten from technology to content and eveiything
in between.

“As far as design goes, as very much like
fashion in clothes, which means, ifyou want to
be very up in the forefront, people will think
you look weird," says Ivanov, “You'll be looking
really hip at some point, then three years later
you're going to look werrtl again."The current
site's moment of appeal seems to have passed,
and even lvanov is bored with the color. Once
again, it’s time for a change.

Sheugwang'os (who is also the seas Busi—
ness Manager) is on the forefront ofinventing
the wcbpage's new look this time around. He
has worked on thc OffrCampus study page,
and rs currently working on a new page for ads
missions. His design bleeds color and features

t biight, surreal images that were copyrighted by
Grinnell for use in the latest guidebook.

Bur next to a cubist rendition ofAmerican
Gothic, you can find pictures of Grinnell stri-
dents, faculty and landmarks. Wang said that
he's continuing to use images from the data-
base on the new pages in keeping with lvanovs
goal ofshowing Grinnell as it is.

Born Free has also found itself falling out
offavor.While itwas a pioneer in its day, most
other colleges now have content management

systems, and Grinnell's DIY code is looking
less and less modern. According to Ivanov,
the college now has three options: to upgrade
Born Free, use open source, or use a new offt
the-shelf content management system. Wang,
at least, has abandoned Born Free and is using
commercial software for his projects.

Wang, Dralus and lvanov all agreed that
one thing is sorely'missing from the website:
student input. Wang wants to see Art majors
and Computer Science majors working side-
byrside on collegerfunded MAPs to improve
the website, and thinks it’s a problem that
none of the Computer Science department’s
MAPs have ever actually been put to use.

Ivanov is eager to see what radical ideas
students could have for the next incarnation of
Grinnell's virtual existence. “Sometimes your
brain gets stale while you're at a job," he said.
“Send me fresh blood."

Exploring peace, love 8t Palestine

Professional "peace negotiator" Jayne Docherty spent the week at Grinnell lead-
ing a Peace Studies workshop on what happens when politics and religion mix.

What does it mean, in your profession,
to be a mediator?

Actually, of all things, l’m not a trained
mediator. People assume that I am
because I teach in a peace build-
ing program. My specialization is
negotiation. I do negotiation and
I do a lot of planning for strategic
peace building — helping people
think about who they need to build
relationships with, what kind of re-
sources tlicy need to change their society and
keep nonviolencc.

Whatwoidd you sayintluencedyourde-
cision to pursue a career in the ‘peacc keep-
ing‘business?

My dad was actually in the military. He
was a career Air Force ofﬁcer. He went to
Vietnam in 1967 and came home in 1968,
and I had joined the anti-war movement. 1
said,“There has to be a better way. This isn't
working." i came into this work from the
activist end, saying there has to be a better
alternative for solving social problems.

What would you say is the most efﬁcient

method for reachingo peaceful agreement?
There isn’t one. Reaching any kind of
peaceful agreement in a conﬂict is hard. May-
be l’ll shoot a question back at you.
What kind of agreement ill what
kind of a situation?
0 What ifyou were rouse say, Pol-
‘ estine and Israel?
b A lot ofthe time, people think or
I. this work as trying to com romise
between the two parties. w lat’s the
most efﬁcient way to get the Palestinians and
the Israelis to cooperate and be nice to each
other? And the answer ‘in that case is actually:
don’t work with both parties. Both parties are
being held hostage by their own violent wings
and so the peace budding approach is to say
that the negotiations need to take place within
the Palestinian gioup and within the Israeli
group. And we’re not going to actually try to
smash them together until we work with the
two sides.
But then in the case of the Palestinians
and the Israelis, how would they quell the
faeﬁons within dICiIOWﬂ countries?

Yeah,l mean part‘ofit is that you have to
shut down some pretty significant systems
of encouragement and support. Anybody
who's engaged in violence against other
people have been called a terrorist group:
It's better to think of them as the most vio—
lent leading edge ofa social movement. And
at a minimum they have to have a commu-
nity that allows them to operate and ignores
what they're doing. Usually what they also
need are some active support, people who
give them money and resources and keeping
them protected. so the way to handle them
wouldn't be to go alter them directly but to
go after their money source, you go after
their social support source. And you build
a relationship with the ‘comrnunities- that
gives them an alternative. If you do justice,
if you address the Palestinians'legitimate is
sues, and then: are many, then they will shut
that system down themselves.

So it‘s like curing the disease instead of
the symptoms.

Right, exactly.
