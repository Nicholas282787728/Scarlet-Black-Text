Recall the ambassadors: travelling team falls flat

BY SARAH Mi RK

Just after sunset on Tuesday, the Darby gymnasium bleachers
were lined with old farmers in Iowa Hawkeyc sweatshirts and doz-
ens of pI’CTEBEII kids, all there to watch the home team lose. Ev-
eryone at the Grinnell Prairie Hot Shots vs. Harlem Ambassadors
game knerv what would happen: the Hot shors would be walloped,
but hopefully tlreyd be \valloped with style

The Ambassadors are a traveling “Globeti‘otters”rtype team.
Theirwebsitc bills them as halfrbasketball stars,half~hip hop danc-
irrg clowns there to provide a “wholesome entertainment produer"
for the financial benefit of the Grinnell Chamber of Commerce,

1 spot only three srudents among the rows or families. Most
likely they were all scared off by the Chamber of Conrmere is
ﬁiiidraising ticket fec,accustoined as we students are to the tiadition
or paying norhing for everything,

With no students around, I try to strike up conversation With
two young teen girls sitting under the basket.Thcy and their friends
are all wearing the badge ofptetccnrdom: eye glitter,

“Are you guys excited>"l ask, all friendly. “Uh yeah,” one of
them replies, in a way that indicates I'm probably, bke, totally retard-
ed. Thankfully, the announcer’s voice bursts over the loudspeaker,
“Welcome the team that dates to challenge the Ambassadors!"

The Grinnell Prairie Hot Shots emerged, consisring of one
young woman named Ashley and 20 middlingrage guys from town.
Though some are balding, rhey all at least look athletic as they stroll
nonchalantly onto the court, high'ﬁving each other in their neon
green trshirts emblazoned with the “jewel of the prairie" logo and
fundraiser sponsors.

"We Will Rock You"begins to pound through the sound system
and the announcer inrones solemnly, “These players’ basketball od~
yssey has taken them to the four corners of the globe, to the frozen
norths ofAlaska and Iceland and the battleﬁelds ofKosovo.”

' The five lithe male Ambassadors and the equally lithe female
Ambassador, Lil’T, bounce a red and white striped ball inscribed
with "The Rock" and do the electric slichockJams remain on full
volume throughout the game,

In addition to dance moves, the Ambassadors also seemed well

trained in rehearsed theatrics.

When Lil’ T's name was announced, she ran over to the Hot
Shots bench and forced a reluctant coach David Arscncault to dance
with her at midcourt. Two of her male teammates approached and
shouted, in unison,"What are you doingil"

“Can't you see what I'm doin’?" she shouted back. “I’m gettin”
down with my new man David!” The two brnwny males picked her
up, threw hei over one shoulder and put her back in her place at thc
top of the key.

while the ion or the audience kindsollenjoyed these perfor
rnances, the Grinnellian in me eorrldn‘r stop thinking about the
rate and gender dynamics.l mean, .r black man rhrowing a black
woman over his shoulder to stop her from dancnig with another
white man?

Luckily, little double zero is a feisty, rebellious character and has
plenty more n/itmrmzy antics up hei jersey sleeves, in the middle or
the first half, she pulls on a lucha Libre wiestling mask and tackles
one ofthe Hot Shots.

But here’s the thing: the Hot Shots acrualiy play decently and
the Ambassadors don't wind up playing all rlrar wild, Yeah, rhere are
a couple alleyroops during rhe course of the game and slainrdunks
abound. Even the ream manager, “Jugglrng Jazz" Copeland, gets
in on the action, bouncing the ball off his hindquarters to another
player. still, it's no our-ot—eontrol laugh riot.

At halftime, the Ambassadors pulled their team chairs into ccnc
ter court and invite a herd ofsmall children to play musical chairs.
Everyone loves musical chairs! The crowd digs it and when a tiny
girl named Leah wins, Beyonce blasts from the speakers and the
team makes her dance off the court with them to claim her prize.
The boys behind me seem 100 percent jealous. .

In the end, the Ambassadors won by 20 points, and Lil'T man
aged to busr a move. Everyone went home mildly enthused. When
I call the Chamber of Commerce the next day to see how much
money they raised, president Larry Goodrich said, “We didn’t really
see it as a fundraiser, it was more a community event for the kids."
The Chamber is hoping to break even on the game, officially makr
ing the enriro event exceedingly aver-age.

B-ball apocalypse

When your team slowly removes itself from the
pennant race, quickly falling from contention to more
than lo games back, it's hard to sray totuscd on base-
ball. But with Major League Baseball's inane black
out rrrles leaving me conrplerely in rhe dark on the
Twins games since my arrival at Grinnell,l have to
get excited about the playoffs. Like you’d want to read
an entire column about a .500 team anyway,

Jordan Kujala '09
yinnlsqtairace Man

Some reams still haven't clinched anything yet.
The slowly seltsdestructing Padres are one example.
In the midst of losing four of their last five, center
fielder Mike Cameron tore a ligament in his thumb
and, in a bizarre incident, right ﬁelder Milton Brads
ley tore his ACL when his manager tackled him so
he wouldn’t attack an umpire. What's next for the
Padres? Will Greg Maddux tear his oblique trying
to hit a home run? Will Brian Giles, after a routine
catch, get a concussion after imitating Gus Frerotte?
1s Jose otterman going to scamper onto the field and
club Jake Pcavy with a bat?

But the Padres aren't the only NL team trying to
lose their way into the playoffs. The Mcts currently
sit on life support, rhe cubs are giving their fans a eolr
lective heart attack (in other words, business as usual),
and even the Diamondbacks, the team with the best
record in the NL, could still collapse and miss the
playoffs entirely.

Which begs an even more important question:
how do the Diamondbacks have the best record in the
National League? Brandon Webb may be tanrastic,
and probably the only player on the team that anyone
iras ever heard of, but they've given up more runs then
they've scored, and. as a team, their OPS+ is in Dam
vid Eckstein territory. Well, David Eckstein was the
World Series MVP last year.

Surely that bodes well for the D-Backs. Except
Eckstein got lucky last year. And only one team in
baseball history, the '87 Twins, has even won a posts
season game after being outscored in the regular sear
son. Diamondbacks fans (if they even exist) get to
look forward to a first round sweep at the hands of,
well, anyone.

Then there are teams like the Red Sox and Yankees
who through keen scouting, player development and
low—budget free agent signings will barely sneak into
the playolts. Sigh. Rooting for the Sox and Yanks is
like cheering for the Cowboys during the early '905 or
cheering for rhe us. over Grenada. You’re just asking
every true sports fan to roll their eyes.

Gmnted, I have some heart. I don’t want Yankee
wiinderkind reliever )oba Chamberlain or Red Sox
bullpen ﬁxture Jonathan Papclbon ro become rhe next
Donnie Moore, But the least either of them could
do is follow in Mitch Williams’ footsteps, subjecting
themselves to the only thing comparable to a lifetime
ofl’hilly ran persecution: a litetinre otNew York/Bos-
ron tan persecution.

This means someone has (0 beat them, As much
as I'd like to think the Los Angeles Angels ofAnar
heim (insert requisite name joke) have a shot, I just
can‘t tiust the aim of Kelvim Escobai or the mullet of
Jeied Weaver. so they're out.

The Cleveland Indians, on the other hand, could
deﬁnitely step up, Even wirh Travis Harrier strugr
glirrg and Grady Sieenrore regressing from last year,
the lndians are ridrng the backs of irnpressrvely
named pitchers CC. Sabathia and Faiisto Carmona
into the playotts. Moving earmona back to a srarting
role might be the besr managerial decision orthe year.
In rhe closers role last year, he finished on opponents
about as well as Ugueth Utbina with a machete. Now
he's'actually getting people out.

i could finish this offby making actual predictions
for the playoffs, picks than would put Steve Phillips to
shame, but I'm going to pull our my handy dandy loc
Morgan phrasebook and take a ditterent route.

I haven't seen enough of these teams play in the
playoffs, so I don’t know how they’ll react to the pres-
sure. But I think that whatever team concentrates
more and stays consistent

you know what, screw that. Cubs over the Indie
ans in sir. I’ve always wanted to see the apocalypse.
