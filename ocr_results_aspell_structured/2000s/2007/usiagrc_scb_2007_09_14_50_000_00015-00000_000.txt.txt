Elephantitis to spread across Mac Field this weekend

av DRAKE BALLEW

Since its Invention in 1968, ultimate
Frisbee has spread like a pandemic, drawing
over 10,000 students and about as many hippie
stereotypes to the fields of college campuses
across the country. It should be no surprise,
then, that G ell is home to a teamiin
racr rtvoﬁif Its own the Griimellephants
(men) and Sticky Frogs (women). Both
teams will be representing the college and
proving that ultimate is more than just aimless
Frisbee tossIng this weekend at Elephantitis,
Grinnell's annual ultimate tournament,

With Elephantitis marking the ﬁrst time
that both teams will play together this year, no
one is cerrain of how Grinnell will perform,

"It's so early in the season that we
still have a lot of things to work on, and
tournaments are the number one best
way to learn," said Brigitte Anthony '11,

Working similarly on individual and
team development, the men also want to
see improvement. “Our focus in the fall is to
raise the skill threshold, teach our offensive
and defensive philosophies and Improve
general athleticism," said Conor McGee
’08, one of the more vocal ultimate players
on campus. “This process Is especially
important for our first-years, many of whom
have never played competitive ultimate."

Given the sizeable number of first—years
out for Grinnell ultimate this fall, the learning
process will probably take a bit longer than
usual. According to Anthony, the Stickies
have “the biggest turnout ever of new players.”
They just need time to develop their skills.

“We had a rough year [last year] and
we lost some of our key players," says
Anthony. “The women's team will be
slowly building up its competitiveness as
we develop as a team, and we would love
to be a strong contender in our region."

Luckily, the fall serves mostly as a warm
up period for the more serious competitions
In the spring, with everything leading up
to the College Seriesiultimate’s version
of a collegiate national championship.

Last year, the Grinnellephants qualiﬁed
for the regional tournament, described by
McGee as “a huge step for our program,"

“My freshman year we weIe trying to
manipulate the tournament director at
scctionals to let us play without paying the fees,
since we knew we wouldn’t advance," he said.

Going into this year, the Grinnellephants
hope to build on last year’s progress. “Last
year put us on the map, so we deﬁnitely want
to secure that With another bid this year.”
Despite the obvious compentiveness and
athleticism required of an ultimate player.
the game remains marginalized In the
sporting world Grinnell's athletic website
reminds us that ultimate is classiﬁed
as an “activity" rather than a sport, and
the team lacks any official head coach,

The culture of ultimate Frisbee is one
or run, fair competition where every game
is refereed by the teams themselves rather
than a third party. Additionally, ultimate is
widely known for its tournament parties,
doing little good for its image as a “serious"
sport. After all, opposing football teams
don't gather for a kegger following the game.

Potentially adding to Grinnell ultimate’s
woes is the stereotype that it has become “cult-
l.ike." While the team prides itself on its recent
success, winning may have its downside. As
the team becomes more competitive, practices
become less casual and less accessible to
a Frisbee player who just wants to throw
the Frisbee around instead of constantly
reviewing complicated defensive sets.

Being a member of the team requiies
more than just attending practices as well.
Captains request attendance at offsseason
workouts and encourage players to do
their own work as well, potentially gIvIng
ultimate an aura of inacessibility. While
most club sports do not seem like fulle
time activities, Frisbee is an exception,

McGee maintains that this classiﬁcation
is excessive, "Calling Grinnell ultimate
a ‘cult' seems kind of flippant," he said.
People are attracted to ultimate for diverse

“If the deﬁnition of a cult is having a good
time while playing an awesome sport with
great people, then so be it," adds Anthony.

Yet, perhaps this “cult" image Is legitimate,
in a way. After all, ultimate has tts own off
campus house, just like most Grinnell sports
teams. They eat dinner together, too, just
like most Grinnell sports teams. As any
Grinnell athlete will note, however, these
associations aren’t meant to be exclusive or
“cultslikefv and ultimate is the same way.

“I don't see us as being broadly cxclusiivc
or obsessive," McGee said, “In fact, the team
is making ultimate accessible to people
