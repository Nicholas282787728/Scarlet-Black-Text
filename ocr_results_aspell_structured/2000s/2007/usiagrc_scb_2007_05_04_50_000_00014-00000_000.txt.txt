I Am Not 0 R0 e Model

your cnckling letters to the editor for any porcnnul rookio mis-
take on my part). Upon hearing that my ﬁnal column woult
run this week, o numbcr ofrny friends quickly rcmnrkcd “Hcy

Maybe I can avoid that title this week, as I leave with semi
spring cleaning ofsorts, addressing some new issues that nevc
quite fit into my blrmonthly, cynical diatribcs and followm;
up on a certain other issue.

To the Track Team: Your sarcastic request for a column or

last few months. Need a boost of camaraderie amongst you
athlete friends? Try and gerJuh-pingrgllh to talk smack abou
you. Honestly,l have no clue what 1 would sny. Can one writ
in a snarky tonc about the latest happenings in the 3000 mete
steeplechase?

To thc Goldcn State Warriors: As long as you close on
Dallas, thanks for pulling oflr the upset and making me pa,
attention to the NBA again, See what happens when team
let rhcir fans go crazy and avoid forcing artiﬁcml noise an
bad music upon them at inopportune times during a game
The Golden State home games have a college basketball at
mosphere, and it actually makes them exciting for a change.

To Brady Quinn: Your look of dread when Miami passe
on you at #9 during Saturday’s dmft will bring me hnppincs
for the foreseeable future. I have never been so excited to se
an Ohio State player selected. Apparently, everyone actu
ally realized that Chiinn has failed ro win big games (winles
against ranked teams last year) and that he might not be
franchise quarterback. May the rhoughr ofnnorhcr incredibl
awkward interview with Suzy Kolber haunt you until trainin.
camp begins.

To ESPN Classic: 1 await the day when everyone sits dow
and reminisccs about the times when ESPN Classic actuall
showcd classic programming, providing incredible procrasti
nation fodder. Now, pokcr, heavyweight titlc ﬁghts nor fea
turing Muhammad Ali, and World’s Strongest Man competi
tions dominate programming instead ofthe great games ofm
childhood. Thanks, ESPN.

To Lou Pinella: It’s May, and an ump hasn’t throvm yo
out ofa Cubs game yet? What gives?

To the Football Tcnm: While n picture of in: may sti]

Like anyone, I want thc team to win more and not serve a
