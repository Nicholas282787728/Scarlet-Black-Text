Bucksbaum isn’t the only place in town for theatre. The 5&3 sent two writers
to community productions to experience Grinnell's wider arts world.

Satire and steak combine at AJ’s Steakhouse dinner theatre

BY ARI ANISFELDv
The box office is a shoe store, the theater
steakhouse and the playwright an econOr
mist, “Good Answer," tirsitriational comedy
written by and starring Mark Montgomery,
Economics, will be performed this weekend at
Al's Steakhouse as part ofGrinnell Community
Theatre’s dinner theatre.
“Good Answer," the third installment in a local
authors prodrrctron series, provides an entertaining
parody of Grinnell life. Montgomery plays Michael
Kammski, a math professor turned acting president
oFa small IOVVJ college that recently lost half of its
endowment
The tension ot the play is driven by Margaret
Kaminski, the presidents daughter who is plryed hv
Mary Powell ',07 Montgomeiils 1 if: daughter.
h’lrir'gar'ct leads a protest against her father because
he is soliciting an alumnus donor who sells bulldozers
to Brazil.
A srde plot revolves around a planned tryst be
tween the presidents wife and his best friend, a
French prot‘cssor played by community member Rob

Montgomery and the can provide the audience
with plenty oflaiighs, although some orrhe jokes feel
forced. Montgomery aptly pokes fun at college smr
dents, yet also gives them credit for caring about the
world (perhaps because he knew students would see
the play.) The economics professor in Montgomery
is apparent, particularly when the rich donor explains
why he will continue to sell bulldozers to Brazil.

“Good Answer" provrdes humor that resonates
with the actors and the audience, taking advantage of
the shared experience oflivun7 in a college towanhc
play's satire of college administration culture tluns‘r
lares into a more truc-to-life production than recent
Grinncll ContinunlryTllCriUC shows like “Lend Me
aTcnor."

“Good Answer" also gives rnsrghr rnto how a col-
lege operates For instance, ifyoil ever- wondered what
a college pr- dent does. Montgomery grves a good
answer: “klssrlig rrch people‘s ass for money,”

It might seem strange to enjoy a satire in a steak-
house, but according to Mike Wherry, President of
the Grinnell Community Theatre (GCT) Board of
Directors, the arrangement beneﬁts both GCT ai'id

more customers,“ he said by e—mail, “and
were in need ofa location to perform."

GCT is currently struggling with meme
betship and resources. They are searching for
a director for their next production, a political
satire called “The Complete History ofAmerica
(Abridgedif'Atter that, “[tlh'rs may be the last
show for GCT for a while," said Wherry. "This
Summer the Board of Directors will be down to two
or three people. our volunteer pool has dried up."
GCT's major problem is the lack ofpcrsonnel to work
on the sound, lights and set.

“The GCT would very much welcome an invitar
tion to produce a joint performance with the college"
as hits been done hvrce rn the past, said Wherry. "We
have some ol’ the best talent but we don’t have the
ibilitv to showcisc that talent as it should be T.hc
community deserves a quality production that the
GCT and the college Theatre department would be
able to provide"

“Good Answer" opened last weekend and closes
this weekend wrth pertornranees tonight and tomor-
row evening. Tickers are available at lsr-own’s Shoe Flt

Play by Shults & Co. brings in "Solid Gold!” for Library Building Fund

BV ALEX CoNloN

Two weeks ago, audiences
clapped along to “Jailhouse Rock,"
nearly wept during a moving rendie
tion of “He Ain‘t Heavy, He’s My
Brother” and enjoyed an enthu-
sirsrie dance nunrber by George
Drake, History, set to “Thank God
Im a Country Boy.’ The lnuSICJl
review,entitlcd solid Goldl, rep-
resented rhe 15 year landmark for
the community production group
Shults 8c Co.,who performed at the
at the B.G. Vocrtman Theatre in the

Grinnell Community center.
Sherry Shults, supervisor at the
Burling erreulation desk, and her
husband Frank Shults, prinerpal or
Grinnell Middle School, wrote and
directed the show, creating a two up
beat hours ofwell-known classics per-

formed by members of the community.
The show features songs that sold over
a million records in the '403 and 50:
(Act I) and the 605 and 705 (Act II).

Proceeds from Shults &. Co, shows
alwi go to local causes; this year's
proc ~ will be given to the Grinnell
Library Building Fund, a local project
to build Grimlclls new public library
The library rs currently in its ﬁnal
design phase and will be named for
George and sue Drake ,

From the first Shults 8:. Co. show,
“Say it with music: the songs oflrving
Berlin” in 1992, through “Solid Gold!,"
the group's hieunial shows have raised
about $40,000 in total,

Some of Shults 8c Cofs members
have been with the group since its
founding, but others have joined the
group more recently, inclrrding gifted

tenor Clark Lindgien, Biologv and
Drake aformer bov soprano (accord—
ing to the program notes). In total the
group consists of 10 vocalrsrs, incirrding
two husbandrwife teams, and a super
son bind, including the Lacina father-
son duo.

Since the “Solid Gold!" audience
was comprised largely of Grlnnell's
senior population, one might have ex-
pected more enthusiasm for the classrc,
berurrrul ballads popular during the
405. Instead, with the exception oftheir
warm ovation rot Drake’s stylish ren-
dition oF"Blue Moon" (picture Drake,
leaning coolly against a wall, as the
lrghts slowly srrrrourrd him, crooning
into a microphone), the audience was
fairly reserved until the band covered
t‘amous rock songs from the ﬁfties.

By the end of Act I, which closed

with Presley's “Jailhouse Rock," the
initially restrained audience clapped
and kept the bent, whooping wrth err
thirsiasm.

Drake wowed the crowd again in
Act II singingiohn Denver s Thank
God Im a country Bov," in which
he stared befuddled at the other
mrle singer-s as they didr simple
sonar-e box stop and then blew them
away with his own impressive dance
moves

Shults 8; Co, will put together
their next show in 2009. In the man,
time, they plan to continue doing local
concerts in Grinnelrs churches, rotary
club and the Mayﬂower home,

Sherry said that Grinnell rs a “coma
munity with a lot of talent,” and this
show made that talent abundantly
clear.
