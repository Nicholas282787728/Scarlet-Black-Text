Trustees explore
future of college

rii' KATE MOENING

The Board ofTrustccs res
turned to Grinnell last week
to evaluate the progress ofthe
college, consider new prepay
315 for the future and ultit
matcly explmc rhc hinirc of
the campus. A central topic
or discussion was clearly cnt
v‘iroiuucntalisru. After listens
mg to cnclgy conservation
proposals from both Free thc
Planctl and
P r e s l d c n t
Osgood, the
board agreed
to implement
Osgood's car
bon emission
r e d u c t i o n
plan.The plan
reduces car—
bon emissions
“roughly by 20 percent over
a period of time," Osgood
said. “We’re going to put a
large geothermal unit in the
athletic phase two, and we’re
going to build a utility grade
wind farm, but we don’t know
where yet."

The Buildings and
Grounds Committee also ap-
proved contracting and corn
struction of phase two of the
new athletic center on cam-
pus, as wdl as the “environ.
mentally sensitive" demolition
of the old PEC. Although the
demolition probably will not
occur for two more years, Oss
good said construction of the
new racilities would probably
begin soon.

While no deﬁnite decit
sions were made concerning
tuition increases at last week’s
meeting, the board did dis-
cuss the possibility of a loan
cap policy, to be phased in
over several years. The board
is currently looking over ﬁg-
ures and potential timelincs,
SGA Treasurer Brad Bishop
’08 said, and is discussing
whether the policy, if implir
merited, would apply to all
students or to incoming stri-
dents only. The trustees also
discussed whether to more

decisions on this issue.

“Tlicy started talking
about a lot of cool nciv pi-oy

on the issue,

emphasized
the signitr

beginning.
“They're tryt

tration," she said.

Plans for the board’s Feb-
marry and May meetings ,8,
main uncertain, although they
will likely continue discussion
of diversity and other similar
issues. The trustees did den
cide that next year's October

ing will focus on sci
faci ties, with the possib ‘ty
of a new science taeility as
well, Osgood said.

Other key issues that the
trustees hope to continually
return to include reexamining
diversity and internationalism
on the campus. Trustee chair
David White ’90 said the
trustees are exploring ways to
involve the college more thor-
oughly with the rest of the
world. “What does it mean
for Grinnell college to be
an international school based
in Iowa, with a Midwestern
heritage, but air international
olrtloolt>"VVhitc asked, “Does
that just mean getting more
international students? Does
that mean having our sni-
dents travel more? Does that
mean more scholarships?
We'ro asking those questions
and making sure that we are
following through on our
commitment."

Opportunity/ow” "

How were you inspired to develop Teach for America for
your senior thesis?

I had boon really focused on this it otcdus
cation inequity, iusr the (act that wherc you are
born in our country does to much to determine
your educational your prospects and in trim yo
life prospects. As a public policy major and a cont
corned college studentl had been taking courses
on it, organized a conference on it. At the same
timc,I was really seaiching as a college senior for
what I wanted to do after I graduatedTliose nvo
things came together to lead me to think, “Why
aren’t we recruiting us, talented, driven college
seniors, as aggressively to teach in low-income
communities as we were being recruited at the
time to work on Wall Street? That was the idea and ljust be»
came obsessed with it.

How do you see post-undergrad service programs such as
yours remaining viable as competition in the workforce and
for graduate school becomes more intense?

I guess it's hard for me to imagine a more inspiring thing
to do right out of college. This opportunity gives you such an
unparalleled leadership opportunity, an opportunity for impact,
and at the same time I think by undertaking this very Challengt
ing experience together with other future leaders you become
part of a network of people who will end up working together
throughout your lives, whether you end up working in corpo-
rate America or public service or whatever it may be,I guess the
choice to do this at the beginning of your career ensures that
you’re part ofsomething really significant.

How can we mitigate the crisis regarding the growing
lack of science and math teachers in America?

I think that in general, our school systems need to recruit
talent as successfully as any other organization in America. I
think that means they are getting out on campus and recruiting
top math and science teachers as majors, as well as other majors
to teach in their schools. Part of Teach for America's idea is
not only to provide kids growing up today with more talented
teachers but ultimately to create a force of leaders that will work
tor systemic changc, Of all the changes that needs to happen
one of the most critical is to think about how we increase the
caliber and effectiveness of our teaching force, and I think our
school systems need to allocate a lot more energy and resources
to that effort.

In what ways did your own educational experience inﬂu-
ence your work with Teach forAmerica?

l think in some ways, but not in the way people might prev
dict. I wont to a public high school that seived a largely privi-
lcgcd Camlnun' land it was and is still widely regarded as an
ex client public school I was widely conscious of the fact in
college that I had had this incredible opportunity to attain an
e\ce11cnt education and as a result I literallv fclt that I could do
anything. lwas very conscious otivhy tlii't was; go to a great

school, got a groat oducarion. That more than anything was
why 1 was obsessing over ensuring that all kids law the same
chance,

Why are graduating seniors attracted to Teach for Amer-
tea?

I think that this genration is becoming more and moie
aware or the incredible disparities that persist in educational
outcomes along socioeconomic and racial lines and are 5
this' is our country s greatest social ' justice and we [1 havc to

do something about it. Wc see such elcir evis
dcncc that we absolutely could eliminate educa-
tional inctjui We could reach the point where
all kids in our country have the chance to attain
an excellent education I think the outpourr
iug ofiiitcrest we‘re seeing on college campuses
has to do wrth a commitment saying, “you know,
we’re going to do this,"both for the kids who are
growing up today. We know it is going to take
longcrrterm changes and we want to be civic
leaders ultimately who affect those changes.

Where do you see Teach for America in is
years?

We are in the midst of a really aggressive effort to get big-
ger and better, to grow in scale, just given the magnitude of
the problem we’re addressing, and in diversity, given that this
problem disproportionately impacts kids of color and kids from
loiwincome backgrounds. We've learned so much about how to
do this well and how the corps members we place consistently
affect signiﬁcant academic gains as well as how to do more to
foster the ongoing leadership ofour alums so they attain posi-
tions ofinﬂuence quickly, so each year we dojust get better.

SPARC elections spark new promises

iii'DrtnKli BrtLLcw

Fol publications employees yearning for a
paycheck, hope has finally been elected. Only a
week after the administration appiovctl a new
constitution for the Strident Publications and
Radio Committee (SPARC), electrons for the
group’s leadership were completed smoothly,
resulting in the election of chair Caitlin Cat-
mody ’08 and vice chair Alex schechter '10.

A new position under the revamped (on,
stitution, SPARC's chair will direct the come
mittee, which consists of a cabinet, board
members and the various media heads.“I basi-
cally am in charge or maklng sure everything
functions smoothly," said Carmody. “In the
past, things have fallen through, things haven‘t
gotten funding. It's myjob to make sure that
SPARC does its job and serves as a liaison be-
twccn the student body and publications."

The vice chair, on the other hand, is (or
sponsiblc for assisting the chair but also for .ir-
chiving all SPARcsapproved publications and

helping new campus publications get off the
ground. Young publications aio a big t‘ociit tor
the Caimody and Schechtei team. “One thing
I’d like my job to he is to make sure that there's
as much accessibility to our resources as there
are students that want them," Carmody said.
And with an annual budget of about $82,000,
those lcsourccs are extent
sivc.

Considering the ice
sponsibilitics ofsuch a pow-
erful committee, the fact
that the elections occurred
so quickly is disturbing to
some students. Other students, despite emails
and postcis, don't know enough about what
SPARC docs to cv i be concerned. “What
docs SPARC do?" cd Paul Brown '03. “Isn't
that some sort ufdrink?”

As the group that “iepic ms the students,

dent media on the thnncll campus,” SPARC
is incredibly important to the dissemination of

mutee determines which publications and rat
dio shows rceoivo binding from its butlgot. For
2007, there inc about seven active publications
and others,likc thc GUM, that are in transition
or have been discontinued.

With the media heads
now involved in the SPARC
process, there is much more
enthusiasm about campus
publications than there has
been in the past “SPARC's
anonymity was so striking compared to its vast
resources " said David Montgomery 08, cm
editor clucfof the 883. “Now, hopefully it
will be a more public organization,“

Daniel Furnta, media head for KDIC,
agreed. “A number or us have been unhippy

opportunity, a chance for something more ef-
ficient.”

“This whole process will be really import
tant for new publications, making things easier
for them," acidctl Montgomoi y.

With Carmody as its head,look for SPARC
to expand on its currently small core or active
publications. “I'd like to help develop a media
community and to help new publications get
otttho ground,"she said. In the past, misman-
agement offtinds by smaller publications made
it difﬁcult for them to ﬁnd funding, “I want to
use funds responsibly and ically encourage a
dynamic creative piocess,"caimody said.

For the moment, expanding the number
or publication. . far from the most pressing
issues facing the coirimittee. Rather, SPARC
wants to take care of those publications that
ahoady exist. “lVly main priorirv (or now is
to get budget. gunned and paychecks our,"
Carmody said. “The rest will have to wait for
later."
