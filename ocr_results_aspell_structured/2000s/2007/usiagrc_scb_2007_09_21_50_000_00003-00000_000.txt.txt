Back to the future: Grinnell keeps on constructing

BVCHRISNEUBERT

After nearly a decade of guiding development at Grinncll,
the current campus strategic plan is nearing the end of its
scope. Since 1998, the current campus plan has spawned coh-
struction projects such as the Joe Rosenfieltl '25 Center, East
campus, the Bucksbaum Center, the renovation of Noyce and
the constiuction ofa new Physical Education Complex. And
while Vice President for Institutional Flair
ning Marci Sortoi said, “there’s still some
life in the campus plan," that life appcais to
be moving toward an eventual conclusion.

Still, the legacy of the 1998 campus
plan cannot be ignored, because the plan

and an expansion or renovation of the lie

phase stops." Sortor said, “and we need to sit down and decide
ifwe're done with building."And with the endowment increas
ing, possibilities to move beyond the campus plan including
adding new faculty and searching teaching methods that move
beyond traditional classroom learning.

Sortor added that immediate plans for campus construc-
tion are limited to improving campus accessibility, which will
inform the administration about future uses for older buildings.
Any other changes, including to the library and the athletic

center, must first be approved by the trustees.

Plans to change the campus, however, go beyond construc
tion and include signiﬁcant changes to modes of learning
throughout the college. “The campus plan provided a commite
nicnt to traditional sct ofdisciplines," said Dean of the College
Jim swarrz, “but within that commitment there was a recognie
tion that many of the exciting academic things that are liape
pening are bringing traditional disciplines
together in a new and dirfcrcnt way."

Fol several years the Expanding Knowl-
edge Initiative has provided much of the
basis for new learning ideas.

Central to the ideas behind the EKJ was
a drive to promote interdisciplinary ConnCC'
tions in all academic areas, “There’s a lot of
exciting stuff going on where faculty mem
bets are recognizing connections between
one another," said Swartz. Chief among
thcse connections this year were the linking
ofclasses with similar themes across majors.

Along with this commitment to interdisciplinary projects
comc significant changes to faculty numbers. “We are gradu
ally adding about three faculty membcrs a year to support this
initiative," Swal'tz said.

Searches this year have already begun for an additional face
ulty member to focus on media study, and another professor in
computer Science to expand the interdisciplinary focus of the
Computer Science department. In addition, Swartz hopes to

begin a search next year for a ncurophilosophy ficulty member,
a position which he said exemplifies the unique connections
that an inteidisciplinaiy focus can make.

Both Swartz and Sortor agree that many ufthe changes to
the campus are driven by a detiicanon to “lnquin-bascd learn—
ing"in the campus plan'rhis dedicatioli,\vhile vague, has been
responsible for initiatives such as the EKI and construction
that seeks to cugagc studcnrs outside ofthe classroom,

Swarm said that inquiryebascti lcarning also allows for tone
stanrly developing new academic strategies that can adapt to
thc changing world, One strategy that has been discussed is
“coherent curricular units," which Swortz described as “more
ephemeral and less fixed than majors and concentrations,"

”These could exist for five years and then it goes away be
cause there’s something else that's cxciting,"he said.

Swartz also suggested that opportunities to incorporate in-
ternational field trips into classes would be a real possibility
several years in the future. According to SGA President Megan
Goenng, such “creative, innovative and unprecedented" proj-
ects are real possibilities because of the expanding endowment.
“The endowment is at a point where it is growing a lot and wt:
are getting a lot ofteturn,"she said,“a lot more than we’ve had
before and it can be utilized in a lot ofdiffetent ways.”

“In the past we’ve been competing to stay on par with our
peer colleges," Goering added, “In five to 10 years Gtinnell will
be moving forward to distinguish ourselves based on our com-
mon goals and values."

Construction underway to transform former student
housing into interdisciplinary “Center for Centers”

BY LINN DAVIS AND ELIZABETH LURIE

The former Multicultural Manor is getting
a massive facelift this semester, as work is cur
rently underway to prepare the building to bce
come a new “Center for Ceiitcrst" starting this
year, Six interdisciplinary programs and centers
will move into the former student house at
1205 Park Street.Thc Roscnﬁeld Program, the
Center for Prairie Studies (CPS), the Center
for International Studies (CIS), the Ofﬁce of
Off-campus Study (ocs), the center for the
Humanities and the Peace Studies Program
will come together in the interest of increased
collaboration and handicap accessibility.

While the new space will prove acsthcti-
cally appealing and ADA compliant, it will
also provide namral op-
portunities for collabora»

In addition, handicap access has been an
important issue since an accessibility panel
composed of students and faculty started
three years ago. The panel discussed speciﬁc
things that nceded to be done on campus. and
improving the ADA compliance of buildings
was a major concern. stemming from these
conversations, the administration wrote an net
cessibility plan last year.The movc ofsomc ofe
