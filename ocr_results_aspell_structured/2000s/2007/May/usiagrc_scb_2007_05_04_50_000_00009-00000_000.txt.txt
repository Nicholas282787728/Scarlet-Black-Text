sandy and Betty Moffett can tell stories
about rubbing shoulders with Bob Dylan at
an audition in New York, but then eyes light
up even more when they talk about children
singing along to their music in Saint’s Rest.
The couple play in the Too Many string
Band, which performed last Wednesday eves
ning rn Bob’s Underground, sharing the space
with Slowpoke, another local folk band with
Griniiell connections.

Frequenters otsaint’s Rest will likely be {as
miliar with The Too Many String Band, a colt
lection ofjovial Gtinncllians including former
Theater professor Sandy Moffett and Betty,
his wife, Physrcs professors Mark Schneider
and Bob Cadmus, father of two Grinnell Col—
lege students John Baumgartrrer and German
professor srg Barber.

“We just sort of fell into it." said Moffett,
explaining the band's formation. The Mof—
fets had peifomed together during and after
college. They were joined by Schneider and
Barber for church events in town, which later
evolved .nto an every other- Thursday jam 5ch
srou in the Forum South Lounge opera to stu-
dents and others who \vl ed to join or watch.

In addition to saints Rest, theTno alany
String Band have also been sccn in arenas such
as the Brrcleshaum Rotunda and the physics
seminar- room. Individually, the members have
plinctl all over the world, and at an and on
in New York, the iVIOlTCIS once watncssed \

“Blowing in the Wind" performance as he left
the building.

The band is committed to maintaining a
connection with the audience and refuses to
accept payment, except for charity events. or to
be recorded. “We like to think we're playing in
our living toom,"said Betty Moffett.

Slowpoke also has strong Grinnell ties—it
was founded by a Grinnell graduatc,Alice Mc-
Gary’98 ofAmes, IA, and her husband Denis
Reich. “I had been pesterrug Alice to play for
a while," said Reich. “1 think she joined to get
me to shut up."

The couple discovered the musical talent
of Pete Moore, a former Grim-tell College Ge-
ology professor, at a barbcquc. someone had
brought "a really crappy barrio," Moore said,
so he went and brought his own, and McGary
and Reich soon brought him on boaid.

The fourth band member, Greg Bruin,
who was unable to perform Wednesday due
to a ﬂooded basement, attended a concert by
MeGary, Reich and Moore shortly after mow
ing to Des Moines from California.

According to Rerch and lVchaty, Bruna
had wanted so badly to be in a hand in s new
home that when McGary informed him their
group could mice a bassist, he learned to play
the bass

The hand had discussed a wide range of
n.inacs,but aftei Bilina showed up late one day,
explaining that his son's lrzar-d passed away, the
hand found the late pet’s name,“$lowpohe," to
he a pcri’eet compromise.

Music department has trouble filling jazz position

Bv ARI ANISFELD
With a hot concert career as a tnunpetcr and arranger, a
history of creating strong jazz programs and the experience
of running a yearly jazz festival in Peril, the recent candidate

fot a Grrnncll jazz professorship, Gabriel Alegnn, seemed too .

good to be true. untortunately, he wasihe rejected the Music
department's job otter and accepted a position at New York
University.

Since the departure offotmet Music professor Ralph Rus-
sell last year, the Music department has been without a ptofc?
set to teach courses in jazz. Whilc the department has under
taken a faculty search, as of yet the position remains empty.
Until it is filled, the department plans to hire “adjunct people

.. usually from Iowa City to fill the position," said John
Rommerciin, Music. .

This is not the ﬁrst time Grinnell has had trouble filling a
jazz related position Two years ago when the Music depart
ment searched for a professor to teach American music, “it got

to the filial stage. . ad [the Music department wasn't] able to
intervrew anybody, said Romincreim.

Alex Conlon ’09, ll jazz vocalist, believes that Grinnell
should hire lecturer Gabriel Esprnosa, Music, fol the job. Es-
pincsa commutes from Fella, where he teaches at Central Col-
lege, two days a week to direct the Latin American Ensemble
and give voice lessons. lbelicvc he would like to work hem and
I think the Music depaitment should have hired him seveial
years ago, she said byc- -mail. lie is an incredible musician, an
energetic director and a helpful teacher." Rornmereim declined
to comment about the poosihrlity othiring Esprnosa.

Conlon said she thinks the department's unwillrngness
to offer Espinosa the job reﬂects a neglect ofjazz and Latin
American music. “i can't recall seeing faculty members tr-em the
Music department attend any otthe Latin American Ensemble
concerts I've been a part ofin the last two yeiits,”she said.

But visiting professor Donna Kwon, Music, who teaches .

World Musrc, said that good jazz professors are in such high

demand that it is difficult for any school to hire them. “Even
large schools located in metropolitan areas have trouble ﬁlling.
these positions,” the said.

Earlier this year, visiting professor and illustrious iazz critic
GaryGiddins 70, who taughtashorr course on jazz spoke em-
phaticallv about the necd for a strongjazz program at Grinncll
In the March 9 rssue of the stag, he spoke about his disaps
porntment that there isnt a jazz department Not a juz teacher,
but a depaitincnt."

“With somebody to conduct the orchestra and somebody
else to leach history." Giddins said. “Jazz snldics are becoming
very big around the country and a school as wellrendowed as
Grrnnell, and as hip as Grinncll, should have something more
than they do.” .

Rommercnn said that the Music department is committed
to titling the jazz professor position and to promoting jazz at
Grinncll. We are teallv hopeful that we can have a stron jazz
program here with a ht'tle luck and perseverance, he seid"
