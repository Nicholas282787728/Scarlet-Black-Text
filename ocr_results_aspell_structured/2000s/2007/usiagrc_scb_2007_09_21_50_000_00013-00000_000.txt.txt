Trees hug
Obama back

I consider myself an environmen-
tal voter, and for me this is one really
important reason to support Barack
Obama, Obama is not your typical
pandering politician on the environ
ment, and his plan to reduce carbon
emissions by so percent by 2050 is serir
ous business.

Obama rolled out his energy plan
in Detroit, the capital of the American
automobile industry, and spoke of our
country's patriotic duty to stop global
climate change and end our dcpcns
dencc on foreign oil. It takes a lot of
guts to deliver the same strong message
of commitment to the environment to
both automotive manufacturers and
Sierra Club members alike The auto
lobby doesn’t often get confronted with
the importance of raising ﬁrel efficient
cy standards, and politicians often cave
under pressure from themThis was the
case with John Edwards, when he vot-
ed to exempt pick-up trucks from fuel
economy standards in 2002, and Hillary
Clinton, wlro cast a vote against Dick
Durbin’s 2005 amendment to raise
them to 40 miles per gallon by 2015.

Barack Obama has been fighting
for the environment throughout his
career. The League of conservation
Voters gave him the highest lifetime
ranking of all othel presidential crin-
didates, above even Dennis Kucinich.
Additionally/,The Illinois Environment
tel Council gave Obama a 100 percent
score for his service in the state sens
ate. I'll be braving the cold to caucus
for Barack in lanuary, and 1 hope you'll
consider joining the.

Outrage out
of context

Two recent letters to the editor
jumped at the chance to respond to
an administrator’s comment that both
letters construed as homophobic. It is
certainly disconcerting that the admins
istration has had to prepare a response
to those who consider our community
as too accepting of various sexual oris
entations.

The response, however, should not
be taken out of context. I maintain
that, With his comments, Jim Sumner
has not attempted to make the campus
less queer-safe or less queer-friendly,
but has attempted, rather, to moderate
between a variety of concerns in order
to protect our community from future
aggression.

Jon Richardson ’10 wrote that
“Grinnell doesn't lose out when close-
mindcd students choose different
schools,” in reference to those who
nrrght apply elsewhere due to resort
vations about the lifestyle hcrc (SEE,
Scpt,14,2007).1 think that, in an effort
to combat an intolcrant eulturc that
(might be) causing Grnrrrell’s lowa ape
pheant numbers to tlwnrtllc, Gillillcll
docs lose out.

Grinnell College is a great plate {or
students across the board to be exposed

to alternate viewpoints, for those to
whom Sumner was referring to (hope—
fully) reject pervasive notions of intol-
erance that they might have grown up
with, or, [or students of a more cosmo-
politan background, perhaps to render
their advocacy more coherent.

Having a recruitment policy that
does not alienate potential lowa stu
dents from applying, despite theit par
cnts’ conscrvatrvrsm, promises to be one
of the most effective ways for the toler-
ance that we hold dear to take root in
the least Likely places. We must not put
up road blocks for the young student
looking to study in a place that he or
she identifies with because of a right
teous concern over losing part of our
own tradition.

To StoncCo and others, I say, have
faith that your reason and tectitude
will prevail on a freesthinking campus.
Have faith in yourselves. That a par-
ent fears thcrr student is going to be
converted to cultislr homosexuality or
other such nonsense should not pre
vent the student from being converted
to the camp of tolerance, and to export
that to a community in which it might
make a real impact. You must love the
little irate maclrinc to change it.

I am not saying that your fears are
unsubstantiated, but give the guy a
break.

Rosenfield
seeks input

Thank you for your sept. 14, 2007,
editorial on the importance of broad
student involvement in planning and
lmplcmcntrng Rosenfield Program
events,

The Rosenfield Program Com—
mittee strongly agrees that this is im-
portant and want to encourage more
student input. Every year we hind pres
posals that are submitted by individual
snidents and groups not afﬁliatcd with
the committee, and we would like to
see more such proposals. Indeed, one of
the events mentioned in your editorial,
the Feb. I, 2007, death penalty event,
was generated outside the commit»
tee, implementing a proposal by Katie
Jares, representing the Prison Writing
Workshop.

We would like to have more student
involvement in our major symposia. To
be honest, we get very few proposals for
major symposia from outside the com—
millet, When we do decide about the
symposia to sponsor, much oftlie plan-
ning takes place in the summer before
the symposium occurs, when students
are not readily available.

ercn an event gcrs to thc irnplcr
rnentation phase we try to let relevant
groups know and to invite students to
meals with speakers, One problem we
encounter is that we don’t always know
who might be interested in a particular
event. Let me encourage students who
want to propose an event or to partici-
pate in an event to let me know and we
will try our best to be responsive,

Naked truth about nakedness

I found myself nearly suffocating in the crowd on
one of those Harris platforms, beer underneath my
feet. Although I tried to convince myself otherwise,
I couldn't wait to leave. ercn I ﬁnally gave up, 1 ran
out onto Mae 17icld,strippcd frcc ofmy constraining
dress and sprinted through the grass, an anonymous
“Run, Forrest, tun!" echoing in my ears.

After I collapsed naked
in the grass, I started think-
ing about what I hadjust seen
at Red Light, Green Light.
I do not think that wc, as
Grinnellians, deludc ourselves
when it comes to the purpose
of Harris. We know that it
is “sketchy," (while people may have been clotlied,I
could easily pick out Bodyguard, Dancer and SUSs
pcrrdcd Congress positions), but we generally accept
it as a lcgitirnate Saturday night activity,

I find it odd that we condone a public behavior
that is overtly sexual, while some Grinncllians criti-
cize public activities that are not at all sexual, Granted,
America does not tolerate nudity
wcll,but Gi'inuell is often hailed as
a refuge for the socially liberal. so
when streaking is denounccd as a
ﬂagrant display of nakedness that
makes people sexually unoomtort
able, I have to wonder why

Ireallze that many people feel
uneasy witli the nakedness of oth-
ers ifit is imposed upon them dur-
ing a streak. You could be the eye-
witness ofn vicious streaking anytime and anywherel
But nudity does not equate to sexuality Ifwe criticize
the streakcr, we confuse the horizontal jog with the
vertical jog.

Unfortunately, most of the naked interactions
we know of are sexq‘claled. But sex is only one of
the many possibilities of nude experiences with our

friends and lovers. We don't see enough naked bodies
in lionssexual contexts to appreciate that a birthday

ked Funky Chicken. When we bare out ﬂesh, we are
not only removing the constraints ofskintight cloth-
ing. We open the doors to a new connection with ()[lr
ers through our bodies, both
sexually and nonssexually,

l have skinnysdipped with
my sister in lakes and oceans,
run naked with strangers, ate

only shoes and sat around
with best friends drinking
wine in the nude, Each ofthese experiences was high
lighted by the freedom that goes along with being nae
ked,There is no hiding when you are nakcd.You have
to be honest with yourselfand with others. As Shakira
says, her hips don't he.

Her hips don’t lie to her lover, and they make no
pretensions with Shakita either. There is no better
way to love and accept your body
than seeing it naked, especially
when you are using it to do some
thing powerfulirunning, for or
ample. You learn to appreciate all
that your body does for you when
you see what your body can do all
on its own. Once you realize your
naked power, there is no stopping
the streaking.

You might even streak through
Harris. It’s been done before, and it's not a bad idea.
Familiarity and comfort with one’s body surely im-
prove the quality of a sexual experience, And after
seeing others naked. you are well informed, and better
equipped to pleasure your partner: ln fact, advertising
your love of nudity may do wonders for your chances
ofa Saturday night hooksup.
