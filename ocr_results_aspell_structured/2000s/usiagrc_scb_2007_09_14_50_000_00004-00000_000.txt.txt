ground, with an election scandal disrupting the normally co-
hesive campus community, Now, SGA is moving forward with

that festering ef

fective communication was central to SGA plans. “Commus

nication is really the gateway to all of the issues and advance-

ments on campus," she Snldi

In the coming year, Gocring said, SGA will focus on reachs
ing our to student groups, conversing with alumni and inform-
ing students of the uses of Judicial Council. The cabinet expects
that the implementation of a second vice president position,
created early last semester, will help SGA better organize, com-
municate with students and accomplish a broader range of

g The SGA Cabinet hopes to focus on student groups as a
key component of the campus community. These groups, par
ticularly multicultural organizations, have in the past been over—
looked or ignored. “We want to get out and get back to places
where SGA has not been in the past," said Vice President of
Student Affairs Jan Koszewski '08. “We want to go to student
group meetings and events to share in their glory; we want to
reach out to student staff and reconnect With people."

In addition to improving communication with student
groups, Goeiing hopes to improve alumni relations. “We've
met with the folks out there [in alumni relations] and are gets
ting excited about reaching out to alums and starting conversa-
tions,because people ofdifferent generations have a 10! to lcarn
from one another," she said. ,

The cabinet will also attempt to increase student awareness

ofthe littlesknown resources offered to them. Vice President of
Academic Affairs Eric Olsen ’08, in particular, wants to inform
students ofJudCo and clear up any misconceptions that might
exist. “I just want people to know that it’s there,” said Olson,
“that they can use it and not be afraid ofit."

The new cabinet plans to pick up where the last cabinet left
off by working with Admissions and l-‘mancial Aid to appeal
to prospective students ofall socioeconomic classes despite the
recent tuition increase. “I think we've realized that it is not the
place of SGA to control tuition.Trustees decide that,"said Go-
oring. “Insteadwo are looking for a more innovative approach.
We are looking at ﬁnancial aid and changes in demographics."

SGA is also planning to work closely with new Dean of
Admissions and Financial Aid Seth Allen to help make it easier
for people ofall socioeconomic backgrounds to come here.

The new Student Initiatives Fund (STIFund) created last
year by President Chris Hall '07 to mill initiative requests,wil.l
