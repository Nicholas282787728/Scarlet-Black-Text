such a demand {or sub-free, at least there has been the past
couple years, that they think that it's a good idea to have it
on South."

Though students have raised concerns, questioning
whether the South Campus culture is a conducive environ~
ment to substance-free living, the Residence Life Commit-
tee feels that the choice of James, as opposed to Cleveland or
Main, will make the transition less harrowing than students
imagine.

“wt got feedback that was like, ‘Why would you svsr try
and make Cleveland substance-free given the history and
the culture.'We heard that but we knew there needed to be

James ﬁrst SA and two-year James resident Adam Langc
'11 said that while he is sad that James will become sub—free,
he is also curious about how the location will function.

“It will be interesting, particularly because South Cams
pus has its stereotype for being a little more rowdy at times
than some other parts of campus," Lange said.

“I'm just so interested to see how the rest of campus at»

next door to Gardner, having parties and concerts and things
like that.”

from p. 1 Marci Sortor, vice president for Inr

stitulional Planning and Associate Delm,

has been discussed as the individual who

will be in chargc ot’rhc formation of the
rcvicw and rhc results [0 be reported to her. “It was a concession
the faculty Asked for that Russell not run this external review."
Herold said,

When approached by the soda, Sortor dcclrncd nn rntcrr
view request.

The first concrete result of the meetings has been the re-
moval of the cease-and-desisl letter. “I’Lljust say I think very
highly ofI’rofessot savarcsc and we mot today and had a grcrr
meeting and he's a flnc faculty member," Osgood said, without
commenting on the censerandrdesist letter.

Snvarcse said he was pleased with the shift. “The President
came to my office today and retracted the ccase—nudrdesist let-
tel. I feel vindicated," Savntcse said. “I remain committed to
free speech, especially in n whistle-blowing context, and I am
deeply skeptical otrhc char-go othamssmcnr or inclviliry from
those who would ptctcr that the truth not cornc our."

Frculry members were unsure what caused the change in
Osgood’s willingness to remove the censcsandsdesm lcttsr nnd
institute the external review. “It came out of nowhere, we were
not anticipating any of what we got at the meeting," Herold
said. “I walked itway shockcd, sul‘plised, and hopeful."

When asked whar changcs had caused thc situation to plugs
less in n positivc manner, Osgood said,“I have seen changes in
maturation and dcvclopmcnr in what's being said that is a hit
interesting."

Exact details on the external review and the changes to fac-
ulty governance are still being ﬁnalized, with faculty scheduled
to meet again next week. However, some form of further action
appears likely to occur within the next month or two. “It‘s go-
ing to be a process that is going to take at least the rest of this
scmester."Herold said. “It's looking at across the College in all
administration processes."

Throughout the dispute, tensions between Osgood and
some professors had become particularly heated, but Savarese
said that the most recent meeting between him and Osgood
had struck a surprisingly positive tone, “I would say that prior
to this incident I had a good relationship with the president and
the president had supported me," Savarese said, “The meeting
today was frank and surprisingly relaxed and not very awkward.
And he wanted to shake my hand at the end ofit."

While many have felt frustrated by the course of events that
began with former Associate Dean and Director of Residence
Life Sheree Andrews’s departure from Student Affairs in Sept
2008, rhcrc is a sense that the groups can move beyond the
difﬁculties to a satisfying conclusion. “Colleges and universi-
tics benefit from vigorous uncomfortable dcharc about things
that are painful sometimes," Osgood said. “And I think talk»
ing about these things actually producels] clear thinking,
not always, but I think this is one of those situations where
talking about it has produced a sense looking forvvatd what is
appropriate and whatwe might do.”
