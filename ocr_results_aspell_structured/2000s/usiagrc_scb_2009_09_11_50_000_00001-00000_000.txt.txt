Disciplinary councils open up

BVBASSILALCHEIKH

Responding to the cry for increased
transparency on campus, the Judicial
Council (JudCo) and the College Hearing
Board are adopting new policies in order to
dispel the sense of secrecy that many stu-
dents feel encompass the two disciplinary
student committees.

JudCc and the College Hearing Board
are the college’s chiet disciplinary boards,
with the Hearing Board overseeing the
more severe cases. “Severe cases usually
come to Houston Doughartyand me," said
Dean of Students Travis Greene. "In these
cases,we refer them to the College Hearing
Board, where they usually result in suspenr
sion or dismissal from the college.”

These hearings, among others, range
from sexual and physical assault cases to
drug sales, academic dishonesty and serious
(heft Cases involving less serious matters,
such as roommate conﬂicts, cigarette litter
and dorm hall situations, are handled by
JudCo.

“JudCo and the College l-lcaring Board
are historically conﬁdential and behind
closed doors," said SGA Vice President for
Academic Affairs Joanna DeMars '10, “We
want to shed light and inform the campus
of what’s going on behind those doors."

“The emphasis ofthe process is to make
the disciplinary structure more transparent,
to explain how these boards work and to
further empower the students that sit on
rhcse boards as judges of their peers, giving
them the support from their community,"
said President of SGA Harry Krejsa '10.

Among these policies tor JudCo is the
implementation ofa public record otthe cases
JudCo resolves, while keeping identities con-
fidential. “This year, we will make the cases
available to see on the website, though we will
avoid putting names in the case descriptions
in order to perserve personal confidentialrty,"
DeMars said. “This helps JudCo with access
to precedent, in order to have a suggestion on
how to handle a case.”

Along with releasing identityeprotected
accounts of JudCo and College Hearing
Board cases to the [SécB], Krejsa and DeMars
have joined efforts with Greene to find bet—
ter ways of involving students in the College
Hearing Board.

“Currently, the Dean of Students is in
charge of appointing students to the College
Hearing Board. The l-lcaring Board has not
long had student representatives," Krcjsa said.
“Travis[Greene] doesn’t like that set up, we
don’t like that setup, so we've set up a general
outline for reforms. Prior to the reform, there
was limited student involvement in the Pm,
cess. We wtil have smdcnt institutions sclect
these representatives, and these are the re—
forms we’re pushing forward and working out
the details."

Grccnc said changing rhc setup has been
a goal Since he and Dougharty frrst arrived at
Grinnell.

“The frrst thing Houston Dougharty and
I did when we got here was include student
representation in the College Hearing Board,"
Greene said.

The reform in membership sclcction has
even trickled down to the forms students “p,

ply with. “Something new we're doing is
changing application forms,"DcMars said.
“To apply to be on ludCo, you won't list
your name on the application, but rather
your mailbox number. This protects both
the applicant and the viewer from any bias."

Though SGA and Student Affairs ale
working together toward considerable re-
form, the final product of the reform pro-
cess still remains fmgmtnrary. “The Col—
lege Hearing Board will make punishment
garidclines to help decide what punishment
is appropriate while also being sensitive to
aggravating and mitigating circumstances,"
Ktejsa said. “Nothing is set in stone—we
have just suggestions and garidclincs."

Even some positions are not completely
set in stone. “Joanna [DeMars] and I will
look into her position as an observer in
JudCo more," Greene said.

Traditionally, the Vice President of
Academic Affairs takes the role of the Obs
server, who is responsible for giving advicc

Krejsa said. “We will be holding our reform

There are too many students who are unr

Hate crime
policy grows

ilv MANDO MoNTnNo

The two largest student interest groups
on campus, No Limrts Project (NLP) and
SGA have started a discussion and broken
ground on a new hate crime response policy.
NLP, which was foundcd last scmcstcr, gen»
eratcd support throughout the year through
persistent actrvrsm. While both groups have
their own projects, the two have already be-
gun collaborating on common ground.

“There is a hate crimes response policy
in the works right now that will soon be rcr
leased to the campus," said Virginia Anderr
sen '10, a NLP member who met with SGA
President Harry I(rejsa.“We want to make
sure that students can give their commen~
tary and that it gets pushed through.”

Andersen hopes to see the response pol~
icy include a preventative .ncasure against
hate crimes and include student lnpuli Kre-
jsa also cried the need for a new policy that
would encourage a camptwwidc discussion
after a hate crime rs committed on campus.

“[Thcic is} a need for education after a
bare crirnc. and educational provrsrons that
will also serve as preventative measures,"
Ki‘cjsa said. “Elena Bernal is really commits
red to getting a good dcal otsrudcnr input
on the hate r-csponsc policy, but she's also
really committed on making a community
device."

chjsa believes that by restructuring rhc
College Hearing Board to allow more stu-
dent involvement and establishing records
of past cases, students can make decisions
based on precedent.

“We’re trying to make the students on
College Hearing board rnore empowered
and we’re trying to make the procedures on
both disciplinary boards more transparent."
Krejsa said.

one of the primary goals of NLP, along
with the creation ofa hate crime policy, this
semester is the rarestablishment of need—
blind admissions for international students
that existed up until three years ago, and to
add a guarantee to meet the full financial
need of international students.

"The current policy allows international
students to be rejected because of financial
considerations, and it's kind of unfair,"An-
dersen said. "When you're a student, you're
entering a stage of adulthood, and you
should be able to decide if you want to go
into debt."

As well as establishing needsblind ads
missions, NLP also wants a revision of the
current emissions reduction at the college
and create an in-house mental health 56F
vicc. Krcjsa is eager to add two full time
mental health workers to rhe college.

“[The creation of an in-house mental
health servaee] has been on top of student
demand for sometime," Krejsa said. “\lVe’ll
be recruiting several students to help with
the search.”

Andersen and Krejsa want both groups
to continue working with each other beyond
the Irate crime response policy.

"We're both in contact with each other,"
Krcjsa said. “We’re both Committed to m0V*
ing past the conflict last year and are com,
mitted to maintaining a productive relationr

ship."
