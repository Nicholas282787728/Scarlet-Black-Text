Futuristic love

Moss people have dimculsy imagining she
air as anyrhing more shan empty space, no
masses whas shey mighr say abous “atoms,"
“quarks," or ”natural life rorees shas make
[them] feel kind ofscxyiin a spirisual way."
But shere are prophers, sharply ussuncd so she
many invisible layers or reality, shas feel she
forceful presence oreolleesive spiris in she air
as unequivocally as she hear or a name, she
friction orsand paper, or she cold, dark ambie
once or your black soul. ( Black soul " or
eourse, rererring only so malevolence and Cot»
rupsion, nos so Soushern oapsism, inst, oranyv
shing as all assoeiased wish melanin orAfrica.)
As a prophes myself, lam parsicularly suised

communieased shrough insensible air borne

I awoke lass Sasurday
morning so on unweleome
barrage or sueh spiritual
feedback, flooding all my
channels orinspirarion. The
rremors of widespread dc-
spair had been building
shrough she course or she
nighs so an exaspesased, clir
inacric roar, which ﬁnally
shnssered my dreams.
Clearly, she world was un»
dergoing some sors ofcmo»
sionsl srnl, Bur what could
is lac? Why now? The answer
soon beeame obvious: 5s valensine's Day had
come and gone once more, and rrusri-ased love
was wailing iss woeful melody.

Grumpy and blcary eyed, I arose and
shocked my prophes mail." As I predicted,
qusssion arses question revolved around
shemes orlove and de ecsion: Will my next
valsnsine‘s Day be as painfully unfulﬁlling as
shis one?" “Will lever see a real, unpiselased
boob?" “Will my Sex always be so damn se.
dlous?" “Will anybody ever love me?”

No, The answer is no. Nobody will ever
“love" you. I suggess you buy someshing
nice—like a vess (or your hamsser or a Sansn
shar sings and dances when you clopiand sry
so rosges. Nos unsil you shake rhas desperase
assisude oryourswill you realize she srue mean»
ingorVals-nsine's Day. I'll give you a him about
is now, though‘ so experience this holiday so
iss rulless, you don's need so sake onyour pants;
you don't even need so wash your hair. All you
need is a small pissol and enough cash so last
you a couple orweeks.

Now, for some ouessions wish subssanee-

Nobody will ever “love”
you. I suggest you buy
something nice—like a
vest for your hamster or
a Santa that sings and
dances when you clap—
and try to forget.

Stop bitching and moaning

Nobody likes a whiner. No one; not you: not me,
not anyone. Keeping that in mind, when someone asks
"How are you?" there are suitable responses. Suitable
response: "I'm ﬁne." Stupid response: "I'm so tired.“
Stupider (yes, that is a word) response: ”I have so
much work." This seems to escape many people on
this campus, and worse, these two responses are usus
ally followed by a tirade about how little sleep they've
gotten in the past week, or a list of all the work they
have to do. Perhaps it is not obvious that EVERYONE
on this campus is sleep deprived and overworked.
Frankly, ii we all didn't have semi-masochistic tens
dencies we’d be sleeping all day at a school like Duke.
Hearing you bitch and moan won't make people like
you. It will make people hate you. Don’t do it.

Leave Burling’s graffiti-safe zone

It seems every time I go into the Burling base—
ment women's bathroom seeking inspiration, I ﬁnd
thefve painted the walls AGAIN. That is supposed
to be our one graiﬁﬁssafe Zone; must it really be
painted over so often? It depresses me. Expressing
ourselves on the bathroom walls is one of the things
that makes Grinnell special, so why keep trying to
make us stop? We are not going to stop writing on
the walls. I urge everyone to write something the
next time you are down there, and I urge whoever it
is who decides to make FM paint over it so orten to
chill.

Warmer weather represses ranting

Okay, so I have to write this rant, but I don't want
to rant about anything. I mean, I could complain
about how I have no time to sleep, how my ribs
still hurt from when I slipped in the snow on Mac
Field the other day, or my crappy roomdraw num»
hes. Or I could complain about how the people who
live in my dorm never wash their dishes (I know I’m
being passivesaggressive). 0r 1 could rant about how
people never clean out their lint traps in the [aims
dry room when they should because it’s just nice.
But I don’t want to complain. Ijust want to say
how'great it was that I didn’t have to wear a coat
today. And how it was warm enough that show
crunches when you step on itinstead ol‘just sound—
ing like Someone chewing cloth. And point out that
only in Iowa would someone consider a high of 36
warm.
