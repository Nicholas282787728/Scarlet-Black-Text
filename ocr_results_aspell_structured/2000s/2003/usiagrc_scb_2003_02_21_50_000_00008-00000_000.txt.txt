Pick up lines that lead to hook ups

Five pick-up lines endure rigorous scientific testing to determine which, if any, will attract the beautiful people

by James Michael-Hill
Guest Reviewer

When I was asked to review something, at ﬁrst I took the bi:-
nnrly offensive and ouchathat’s»kinda»funny-though rourc and ehose
to review women. Then I realized just how much ofan ass Lhal would
make me, and chose the lesser ms route orpiekup lures. in hopes of
lessening even that blow, i would like ro srare rhar l’m vory rhankful
ro rhese women for purring up with mo, andi hope that more are no
hard feelings, Baby.

The criteria are as follows. All ofthe pickup lines were delivered
or a Harris parry, ro women who i had either nor talked ro, or only
exchanged a few words with. I rried to piek girls who didn't know rue
too well, and ifl picked a few who may have been more than a little
reocprivo ro my shameless flaneries, well diai's just reviewer bias.

Oh yeah, i rhoughr they were all cure, roo. Ahcm. Anyway afrer
delrvering rho pirkrsp line, I waired for rho full offoer ro sink in,
and then I asked them how it worked, on a

stale ofnn: to ten. Good line, or bad

line?

The first line I used was shame»
lessly stolen from Adam Pottilla. I
wear up and rnrroduccd myself,
and afrer getting names 1 srarod
“I don't really use pickup lines. -

I'm more about the emotional

connection." My abrcer rooloo

srarus musr have been showing, be.

cause I got rhe sense rhar rhis didn'r go

over so well. In facr, i couldn't even get

the review from her. I had to ask her friend,

who gave it a 4 out of 10, because the girl i gave rhe pickup line to
had already walked away Perhaps we should downgndc that ssore a
litde.

This next line was a link nerve wneking for two reasons. One is

rhar us a fairly sappy line. The second reason is rhar i had never. ever
nlked to this girl. Not arall. l rhink rho relomarkorers refer ro rhis as
cold calling. As sho was walking pasli l marched her pacc, iookod
behind her, looked at hor againi and exclaimed “That's odd, no
wings,.. I would have sworn you were an angel." The offieial review
was a 5 or7, bur it musr have worked horror than rhar, because one
ofniy racquetball buddies, whose name rhymeswlth Sharon DoNiro,
came over to deelaro rhar i have animal magnensm. Thor’s aorually a
prorry good response, but I rhink rhis lino should be used with Cau-
tion. Tho only rhing holding this up was us humor value,
which is a good rhing, but ofrou dangerous. “Hi, I eat babios"
probably only works on gorhs.
The low poinr of the evening
came with whar musr have been the
low line of rho ovoning, and 1 don't
blame her for rhis ono crrher. “I socm
to have losr my phone numiJEr. could i
borrow yours?" Whar i mean by low
poinr is 3 our of lo. I rhink whar shc
mcanr by abut ofio was "at four it didn't
mskornowanrroliiryou."Avoidrhislinc.
The non complex line ofrho ovening was rarhcr
difficulr ro eoorriiuare. It isqiiired borh you nnd your target
