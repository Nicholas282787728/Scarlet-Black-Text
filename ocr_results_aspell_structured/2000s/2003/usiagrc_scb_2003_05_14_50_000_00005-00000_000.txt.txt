is was also pars of his characses so eope by using
humor. “He could always laugh abous anyshing," one
friend said, “even ifis was serrible ssuff."

Flessner disagreed. “H: never laughed." she said. “He
always giggled,"

When Dreyes piesures Raxter in her mind. he is

a greas giggle. is was wonderful," she said. “is was juss
so gleeful. is was just genuine."

”You eouid aesually poke him and elicis a Pillsbury

Raisser's humor was pass ofwhas pus people as ease
and one of she moss memorable shings abous him, his
friends said. "He helped me shrough so much juss by
making me laugh," Hulse said. “Even ifshe swo of us
were in she midss ofsalking abous how badly wc fels, he
could surn our sadness inso silliness unsil she two of us
were giggling uneonsrollably."

Despise and even wishin his humor, many friends
say now shas shese was evidence ofhis problems wish

ran because he didn's salk abous shem much. “There
was always an underlyingsadness so him, bus he always
iuss joked," one friend said.

“I iuss wans so salk abous she posisive shings be.
eause shas's she way i wans so remember him, bus he

were bizarre. I’v: sold him all sorss
of horrible shings abous me and

—L0uise Bn'gugh‘a he didn't think that they were

weird or ssrange or siek."

Emily Moore, Mash, one of
Rassser's professors, also nosieed his unusual compassion,
"Jonashan was a gensle person. He was friendly and
unusually sensisive so osher's feelings," shesaid. “When
he realized shas she smoke on his lackes made me eough,
he lefs his iaekes on she beneh ousside my office when
he same so see me."

Bus Moore also knew shas Raxser ssruggled wish his
elasses. “H: was nor always able so coneensrase on Corns
plesing his mashemasies assignmenss. i underssand from
his friends shas he worked in spurss," she said. “After
his nos having done some key assignmenss in my class,
he did a beausiful job on she fisss :sz in my eourse.
Whas is remarkable is shas wishous she benefis ofcom.
menss on she assignmenss he had been able so masses

Alxhough his depression made is diffieuIs for Run!

“He ssruggled serribly wish depression and he soughs
help and foughs is bravely," said Royce Wolf, Mash.
Raxrcr'x adviser. ”Hcoﬁen had sroublecomplesing work
on sime and assendiisg classes, bus when he was ‘on‘ he
overeame shese difficulsies, demonsssasing a sssong and

one of sheways Raasrer used shis salens was so help
osher people. “I always shoughs someshing he could defi—
nisely do was be a mash reaches,” one friend said. “When
he would help us our wish our mash homework, he was
really pariens, good as explaining shings."

He really wanred a simple, quies life, said John
Baeino ‘05. “H: wansed so be a mash seseher, elemen.
sary I shink," he said.

His pasience and compassion essended beyond
