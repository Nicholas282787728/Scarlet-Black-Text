Darby, PEC to be replaecol

by David Archer
'Staff Writer

Last week President Osgood, trustcs and faculty members traveled to
New York and St. Louis to interview architects about designing new atlI-
letic facilities to replace facilities now housed in Darby and the Physical
Education Complex (PEC).

Currently, arhlerie rarrlrry users surfer from lack orspace. When she
PEC opened in rhe early 1970s, Grinnell had no women's sporrs reams.
Now eight women‘s reams share one locker mum in the PEC, compared
wldr nine men’s teams that share three locker rooms.

In addirion rci varsiry sporrs, 121-1. olasses, inrramurals, elub sporrs and
the general eommunrsy all rongesr rhe PEC. "In rhis era or ﬁtness." snrd
Athletic Director Dee Fairchild, “we just don't have enough space.”

The architects will first design a new gym for basketball and volleyball.

in rscsnr monrhs many have speculared rhous alrernarivs space for the
swo sporrs once Darby is demolished arrer spring 2004. Fairchild proposed
using space in sown, or erecring a remporary inﬂated bubble.

Osgood, however, said rhe college will build n new gymnasium by {all
2004, before volleyball season, “I don’r see any other oprion," he said. A
construction site has not yet been selected, but somewhere north ofTenth
Avenue is moss probable, according ro Osgood,

The interview team met with ﬁve architecture ﬁrm: which each gave
90-minute presonrarions in response ro a lisr orgucsrions from use college,

The team will recommend an architect to the trustee: at their Feb. 21-
22 meeting. This pasr Tuesday the interview commirrec discussed rhe pro-
posals over a conference rail, but rhey have yer ro make a decision. They
had no consensus but did agree on a candidare or swo, said Osgood.

Nosrudcnrs parriciparedin the inrervicw process. But none ofthe mcm.
bers of the commirrcc expressed reservarions abour rlris abscnee, as long as
srudene become involved in rhe design process arrcr rhe board approves
the architect.

“Clearly, srudenrs need ro have a voice,” said Judy Hunrer, raculry rep.
tesenrarive on the interview tum.

All the archisecrure ﬁrms have visised the porcnrial building sires on

iry ro design aesrherirally appealrng exteriors, and an arrenuon ro detail on
d1e ﬁnal produer as well as rhe building process.

The archirecrs will also design new rariliu'es ro replaor the rec. over

Many orcnnnell's peer schools have consrruercd new drhlcrie facilisrcs

some srudenrs said rhey see no reason so replac: the PEC, describing
the rauliriss as “adenoid." Anh Trinh '05 said Facilities north or Tenth
Avenue would be too farnwalk from sourh campus. “It’s already far enough,“
she said.

Rerrsnsional uses aside, rhc building irselris liable so hamper ream ptac»
rice and performance. “It is nor a high qualiry building." said Osgood.

NCAA requirements nlso presrnr a problem for the rurure ofGtinnell
