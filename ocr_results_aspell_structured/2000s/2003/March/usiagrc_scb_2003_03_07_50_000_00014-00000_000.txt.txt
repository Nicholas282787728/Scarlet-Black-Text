- Cricket teams have ti players. The

ﬁeld. The defense has a bowler,
wirketkeeper and nine ﬁelders.

The pitch is a swim long track
with wickets, which are three waist
high poles, on either and. Yhe
batsmen stand roughly even with
the witkeb. The bowler takes a
running start before bowling a ball,
and must not pass the wicket before
releasing the ball. The ball must
bounce once before reaching the
batsman.

' Onte the batsman hits the ball,
the offense scores a run when both
batsmen safely run to the wickets at
the other end or the pitch.

- Every six balls pitched equals an
ever, rhere are so overs in an
inning. tine team uses all their overs
before the other team batx.

- Wickets are like ”outs" in baseball.
if a hit ball is caught on the fly, or
the runners don't safely move
between the wickets, or the bowler
hits the wickets, the defense scores
a wicket and the batsman ix out,
Since each team has 11 players, and
two batsmen are an the field at
once, each team has ten wickets
during its inning. When a bamnan
is out, the team sends out a new
batsman.
