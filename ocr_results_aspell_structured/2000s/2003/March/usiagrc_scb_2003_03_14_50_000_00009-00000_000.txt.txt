ihe Streets is actually Mike skinner, whose 2002
release ”Original Pirate Matenal" introduted the
antish accent to hip-hop and, according to some
reviewers, truly captured the essence oi being
young and british. Since we don't have enough
money to go where the people are actually young
and antish, we thought we’d go listen to ihe
Streets and live vicariously.

Vanety Playhouse, Atlanla, Ga.7S13

For Maitli 19th. we were mnfionted with a diihtult choice‘ seeing
the metal band Disturbed In Maine, or catching Cal Powels In
Atlanta. on the Disturbed website, their lead singer David Diaiman
explains his goal: ”What I’m trying to do from a lyntal perspective
is bnng back the mayesty of metal." Thewebsite goes on to
proclaim that, thanks to his ”leather-lunged proiettion," Dialman's
vocals ”can both bludgeon and slash at a level that transcends his
iyncs' liteml meaning.” We iound that to be scary enough to
persuade us to go with (at Power, whose lead singer (hail Marshall
is plenty disturbed, but in a quieter, gentler way. Marshall has been
known to have nil-stage breakdowns that ﬁnd her turled in a fetal
position with ians trying to torniort her. That’s our kind oi
disturbed. But hey, it you want to be slashed and bludgeoned by
the majesty of metal, be our guest.

”Music,” says Vanni, "is an incredibly direct
language. It bypasses language and legit, and
speaks directly to your soul.” However, if you
happen to teel aoaderni: withdrawal and need some
light reading over break, Vanni has just published
his autobiography, Vanni in Words. It details his
ehildhood in Greece, his college years at the
University of Minnesota, where he majored in
psychology, and his nse to tame and tortune as an

Whoever we ended up seeing lost night, the

March 22, 8 p.m.z Gallagher

Municipal Auditorium, Nashville, Tenn.7325.50
when the opportunity tor a Nashville doubleheader
presents itself, we can't say no. Especially when the
second ieature is none other than Gallagher, the
legendary fruit-destroyer! Far those unacouainted
with Gallaghers shenanigans, his basic shtitk is to
don a beret and demolish various iood produtts
using something he calls the "sledge-o-rnatie." how
he got iamous by doing this both mystiﬁes us and
restores our taith in the American entrepreneurial
spirit. Although we could probably buy a
sledgehammer and our very own watermelon for
less than :25, we are lazy and perfectly willing, in
our imaginary trip, to pay to see Gallagher make a
watermelon explode on stage.
