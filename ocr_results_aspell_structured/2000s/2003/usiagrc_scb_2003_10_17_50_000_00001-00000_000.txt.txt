Du Bois comes alive

Speakers emphasize importance of history and self-examination to the cause of social justice

by Dilara Yarbrough

“Even though [some of] WEB, Du Bors' works are a century old, it
was interesting to see intellectuals use his concepts and ideas and molding
them into something i can use today," said Molly Kafka ‘06, wire at.
tended the “Diversity, Democracy, Du Bots” symposium lastweeic speakers
highlighted the connections between the past and the present in an inter.
disciplinary dialogue about the contemporary relevance of Du Boisean
concepts,

Discussion centered on a common desire for social justice. After corn»
menting on the historical and contemporary existence ofraciai inequality,
speakers discussed the importance ofedueation as the guardian of free.
dom, “Our colleges and universities have to rcsist centuries ofinvidlous
production ofrvhite tacistsupremacisrs,” said Professor LuciusT. Outlaw,

Jr.

Professor Emmanuel Etc said he hoped the symposium would con.
tribute to "promotion ora future when none of these racial problems
would occur or be so intense."

The contemporary colorline

“I was born and raised in Mississippi undcr apartheid." said Outlaw.
Outlaw discussed the Color Line as a daily reality of racial inequality. He
identified whiteness as :in organizing principle of the United states'
economy in ”assuming command” of resources necessary for survival and
production of culture.

Keynote speaker professor David levering Lewis concurred. “The hair.
damental problem was not color but the regulation ofcapirai," Lewis said,
According to Lewis, Dir Bois understood racial injustice primarily in terms
of “the manipulation of race in the service of wealth." iervrs suggested
that Du Bois' vision ofsocial justice, as evinced by his tonversion to come
munisnr late in ir t was marked by "a better world rrying to be born one
side the grounds of rapacious capitalism."

Historically, Outlaw said, people who identiﬁed themselves as “white”
believed they had a God—given “dominion over all other forms or life on
this planet." He asked, “How is anybody else then supposed to have anyr
Kiting)" He answered his question in the rhttorieai voice orthc oppressutt
“You have wliatwc {racist insrirtitrons anti indivrduaisi give you [people of
color], rfvve don't kill you uir" Du Bois, otrriarv said, was skeptical of

capitalism because it is driven by the logic of“proﬁt maximiution" and
aims to create scarcity rather than to solve the searcrty problem.

History as a key to the present

Grinnell studcns at: oFten told that race is a social construction, but
what does that mean? “There arc all klnth of social construction: that arc
as real as hcll.” Outlaw said. scholars who presented at the symposium
agreed that “race" was one.

outlaw argued that because racial inequality has become a social racr,
the concepts orraeral identiﬁcation cannot, and should not, be done away
with. “Generating meanings even about our physiul features is necessary
What we do with drose meanings is contingent The rnischiefhas been
in regarding the contingent as the necessary" he said.

Outlaw criticized Proposition 54, sponsored by Ward Connelly in or.
der to prevent all use of racial or ethnic categories in California, Outlaw
applauded the supreme Court’s rejection orProposrtion 54 in favor ofthe
idea that racialiaed categories must be employed to promote diversity.
Connolly‘s idea that discriminatory judgments should never be made was
“rust flat out stupid," outlaw said. Outlaw argued that ignoring racial
groupings would impede the fight against social inequality. ”How can you
press for rights for issues that affect the group of people we can no longer
name?“ he asked. “lfyou think this is only a linguistic issue l'm sorry, I
think tirats inst misguided,"

Alumni sciroiurshaka McGlotten ’98 said, “To eliminate race would
be to silence in The very fact that [feelings ofshatnc and guilt aboutwhite
privilege] still happen means that there's no way to eliminate it."

Du Bois was interested in dismantling racial prejudice and at the same
time rccognizlng the unique contributions ofArricancAmericans to socir
ety. Outlaw quoted Du Bois. who said ofassimilatron: “that worrid mean
that we would cease to be Negroes as such and become white in action if
not in color," Rather than assimilate or ignore racial groups, Outlaw sug
gested that Du Bois sought “unity in diversity."

activity fund
evaporates

As money goes toward mental
health policy changes, student
groups look to SGA for funding

by Brendan Mackie

This year $30,000 less will be available for students
and student giorrps than was made available last year This
is because the Student Activities Fund (SAF) has been
scrapped this year to fund mental health ininzthﬁS. As a
result, most funding for student groups comes from the
coffers of the son. "sons budgets already spent, and the
money’s pretty tight," said Tom Crady, vice president for
student services, whose office nowoontrols the money that
would have gone to SAP.

The SAP has had a turbulent past between in begin.
ning in 2000 and its demise this year The moncy had
come from a variety ofsources: the President's Oﬁice, the
ofﬁces ofStudentAfFain and all the aqdcmic departmenu,
“For years we had students go from department to depart.
ment to request
money, " Crady
said, “but it Wm

mental money.
one year we dc-
cided to consoli-
date that money
so we didn’t hzvc
studan running
around to differ-
ent places," That
consolidated Fund was the SAP.

Between 2000 and last year, the SAF shrunk from
$70,000 to $30,000, According to Cndy. this is because
“the money has typically been increased and decreased de.
pending on what our own budget situation is.” Budget
increases for departments have been “genually very
small" over the last few years, and so there is less money
budgeted tn daem to spend on student groups Adminis-
trators also thought that the money earmarked for the SAP
was not being spent. “We've always had more requests than
the money available," said crady, “but the money spent
has always been less than the money given."

The money that was once the SAP is now earmarked
for the new mmtal hcaith scheme. “1 have 330,000 in my
budget," said Tom Crady, “but I’m not spending it her
otusel don't know what rhc mental health program is gonng
to cost," As in past years, students are entitled to eight free
visits to the Powcshiek County Mcntal Health Centu and
this year therapists are available at the campus health cen.
ter on a walk-in basis. Ctady said that he did not know
how much ofthc $30,000 the new mental health scheme
will absorb until after fall break, at which point some of
the money could go back to student groups

in the meantime, student groups areail feeling the pinch
differently. "(The d:mis: of SAP has] burdened m with
more budgets,” said Doja Khandkat ‘05, SGA assistant
treasurer.

According to Aditya Bhave ‘06, president ofIntcrna»
tronai student Organization (150), “Thc only really large.
scalc event we had thus far has been the ISO food banal;
and we knew that we would have trouble getting funding
so we asked for a bit less [than usual]. We were given the
money that we asked for,"

Larger projects, however, have not been funded. stu—
dcnt Organization of Latinas/Latinos (SOL) secretary
Esmcr Flores ‘04 said “SGA couldn’t fund our performance.
We asked for $3,000 and SGA declined to give us any
