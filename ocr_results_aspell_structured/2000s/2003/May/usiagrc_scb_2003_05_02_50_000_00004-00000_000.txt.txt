New parking lots are planned for next
year, but parking regulations are not likely
to change dmmarically, said Dirccmr of
Security Steve Briscoc.

The Campus Parking Committee.
composed erstudcnt and faculty reprESCn»
tativcs along with mprcxentativcs from Fa»
cilitics Management and Security, will look
at thc distribution ofstudent, faculty and
guest spaces during than May 7 mccting,
Briscoc said. They Will also discuss new lots,
long-term parking concctns and parking
regulation chnnges for 2003-2004.

Expanding old parking lots and the ad.
dirion ornew ones are planned for nextyear.
although Briscpe is not sure exactly how
many nddiuenal spaces will beamilablenetr
year.

Briscoe denied rumors that oﬁampus
college-owned (occo) houses are being
closed ro open new parking spaces.

“We are not dcmollshing the OCCO:
tn create more parking lots," he said. “W:
at: demolishing three OCCO house: be-

cause they are no longer nccded as student

housing and they can't realisrimliy he

Vice President of student Affair: Tom
cmdy said that he “honestly didn't know"
iflots would be construeted where occo
houses presently stand.

tive, hypothesized thnr rrnm now on. park.

central campus. “students will have to deal
with walking,” she said.

Although ion sometimes appear to he
overﬂowing. the number orstndenrs brings
Eng cars to campus has remained relatively
consistent in the pasr few years, Bristoesnid.
crrdy confirmcd that there has not been
an increase in the number orstndenrs with
cars. The reasons for new lots. he said. were
the eventual planned removal orthe Darby
parking lot and rhedeire for parking proxi-
mate re the new East Campus dorms.

The numberofparking violations cited
by security, has also remained about the
same. “wc are down at this time from
previous yezts." Briscoe said, “These num-
lscrs will always ﬂuctuate."
