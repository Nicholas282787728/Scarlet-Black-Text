The 8&8 asks FTP activist Molly Offer-Weston
‘05 about organizing protests like last week‘s

Who decides FTP protest turgeLs
and strategies, and haw?

There are multiple subgroups with speciiic
foil in FTP, chosen by whoever wants to lead
something in which they‘re interested. The
subgroups change each Semester. We usually
work on national campaigns that a lot of
other student groups and grassroots activists
are also working on. For corporate
campaigns like Staples, oihco Max, Ofﬁce
Depot, etc., usually a coalition oi national
notrforrproﬁt organizations will select an
industry leader and begin negotiations with
them, and they'll be supported oy grassroots
groups across the country.

How did you begin learning about
the behind-the-srenes work that
goes into planning an
environmental protest?
FTP has o protest or two each
semester, so there are always
people with a lot oi experience.
Usually older students
p-M ~ ‘ will warkln a group

' . students and train
them My first
.semester here we
’rl had at Staples
protest in the
, Endangered
l, Forests
.— subgroup, and
the ﬁrstryears
were coached through
what we needed to do.

Why was Office Max
targeted?
In the oiricc supply store
industry, Staples was selected

ﬁrst because it‘s the biggestond once that
conipoign was won, Ofﬁce Max and oiricc
Depot were Selected simultaneously betause
thcyre prohohly the next two biggest
stores, and they have franchises across the
country, Often our protests occur on
national days or action, so while we may
not calla specific stove to tell them that
we're coining, usually they'll know that
there's a possriiiiity there will he an action
on that day.

When the protest is aimed at u
business, does FlP inform the
business beforehand?

[think they called the store for directions

this time. But they didn't say it was ror a
protest. Usually our pro

How does a group prepare for the
possibility of arrest?

That‘s an intense, long question Members
oi the direct action group meet separately.
Using group consensus decisionnaking,
they talk about all the possibilities, call a
lawyer, talk with their police and legal
support people. It‘s very structured, and
they bemme very aware of everything that
could happen to them during and after the
action.

How many hours would you
estimate goes into planning a
protest such as the Office Max
action?

The week before, hours and hours. Two to
tour or more hours the couplz oi days
before, depending on what you‘re working
on. Just doing media takes a couple of
hours. Also there's sign-making, ﬁguring
out last-minute transportation, lots of
stuff.
