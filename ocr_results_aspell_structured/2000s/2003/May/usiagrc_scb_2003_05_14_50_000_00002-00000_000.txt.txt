How do telephone
counseling and
suicide hotline ser-
vices work?

Different services vary in
what they orfer. but in
generalyou can ring up and
speak anonymously to a
counselor about any sort of
problem in a no-pressllre
context. lalking the situation
over with a caring,
independent person can be
of great assistance, whether
you're in a crisis yourself or
worried about someone else
who is, and they usually have
connections with local
services to refer you to if
iurther help is required. Vou
don't have to wait until the
deepest paint of a cm‘sis or
until you have a life-
threatening problem before
you seek help.

What to do to fight
suicidal thoughts

- lalk about suicide. Your ability to explore
the feelings, thoughts and reactions
associated with depression can provide
valuable perspective and reassurance to your
friend or loved one who may be depressed,
Talking about suicide does not plant the idea
in someone's head. Not everyone who thinks
of suicide attempts it. For many, it’s a passing
thought that lessens over time. For a
signiﬁcant number of people, however, the
hopelessness and exaggerated anxiety brought
on by untreated or under-treated depression
may create suicidal thoughts that they cannot
easily manage on their own. For this reason,
take any mention of suicide seriously.

0 Go out with friends and family. When we
are well, we enjoy spending time with friends
and family. When we're depressed, it becomes
more difﬁcult, but it is still important.
Visiting or allowing visits by family and
iriends'who are caring and can understand
may help you feel better.

- Avoid drugs and alcohol. Most deaths by
suicide result from sudden, uncontrolled
impulses. Since drugs and alcohol contribute
to such impulses, it is essential to avoid them.
Drugs and alcohol also interfere with
medications prescribed for depression.
