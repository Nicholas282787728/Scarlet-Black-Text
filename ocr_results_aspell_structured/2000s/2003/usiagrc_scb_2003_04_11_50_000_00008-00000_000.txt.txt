Fleeting movements

Members of Dance Troupe, faced with a shortage of members this semester, discover new
avenues for their creative talent and reach out to dancers and non—dancers

by Eva Constantaras
Staff Writer

with lust nine students in Dance Troupe this semester, the group
found itself trying new things and bringing in a variety of other students
in order to uphold in high standard quuality while trying to avoid overt
taxing the dancers. The result of this endeavor an be seen in the group’s
upcoming performance, entitled "Fleeting Fictions," that opens Thurs-
day, April 17 at a pm. in Rubens Theatre.

Jessica Berton, director of Dance Troupe, said that this year's show
“focuses on the kinds of momentary connections we make with other
people and how those connections shape our lives." .

Using their limited resources to explore new avenues ofereativity, four
members, Shim Pagan ‘025, Hrdrher Gliddcn ‘03, Shelby Hayhoc ‘04,
and Laum longan ‘04 contributed to this theme hy
choreographing their own pieces. Their efforts have
yieldedthree uniquedantesmwhidichoreographeis
and dancers aiilte explore new facets of modern
dance.

Pagan, a veteran Troupe member, used the
Troupe member shortage as an opportunity to real
ire a concept that she has been toying around with
for four years: an allmale dance. Despite the chair
lengo in choreograpliingan alltmaleznd non.rroupe
member dance, ragan persisted in pan to defy stea

reorypes,
“Dance in the United State: is so dominated by

women that it makes dance a feminine thing," said
Fagin. she thinlrs that historically, many lands of
dance developedas ”low level pornography" and diet
the traditional male choreographer directing female
dancers oontributes to this morally questionable aspect ordanccThtough
het choreography, Pagan turned traditional roles upside down. “The re
versal has been interesting," she said.

The dance is also designed to invite men to panalte in an art form that
society has largely closed to them "It’s a serious dance because I want the
male danocrs to be taken seriously," she said. “I want people to leave thinking
that men can dance onstage and be men and not be less masculine for it."

"The Moon is the Sun at Night" involves eight male dancers, none or
tvhom have had formal dance treining Music from the stone Temple
Pilots, the soundtrack For Frtrjzzrié, and Niivana Unplugged set the tone
for the piece. “I thought ifl got the right group ofgnys,.. we could put
togethetsomething that was really different," Pagan said "Getting to worlt
with a lot of different kinds of people and seeing their enthusiasm is very
rewarding,"

The rewards, however, have not been without challenges. "There were
things I ivasni expecting,” said Pagan. “Women have limited strength and
seemingly unlimited ﬂexibility But males have seemingly unlimited
strength and limited ﬂexibility,” She said she "tried to make it comfortable
for them" by adapting the dance to their ahiliries and making it less tech.

that’s what distinguishes the movement quality," said hogan.

Glidden, in contrast. was not planning to choreograph a dance for the
performance, but said “a few specific movements ltept rolling around in
my head" along with "a couple of speciﬁc themes daat I’ve been noticing
in my life" until "i just had to get it ourl" once she put ell ofthese ideas in
a dance, ”Allow for the Possibility” was born.

Like ell of the other Troupe pieces, Glidden still had to contend with
the shortage ofdancers. “I wanted as many people as i could get for my
piece." she said, "but many Troopers understandahly weren't able to com.
mit to being in another piece in addition to the ones they were already
doing " So she asked another student and fellow dancer, Emcr Griffin
‘05, who is not a member of Dance Troupe to participate and is also
dancing herself. “The drsirc for more dancers is also why i decided to he
in the piece," she said. “I normally would not he in
a piece thatl choreographed." with techno music,
unusual blue costumes, and six dediiatcd dancers,
the dance will allow the audience to make in own
interpretations.

Hayhoo's and Langan's door has a much lighter
note andiolastminuteenrry into theshow is thanks
to the ﬂexibility that a smaller group ordancers pro»
vides. "we ltinda decided at the last minute to do a
duct and just threw it together," said Langan. "we
wanted to make it funny, which is easier."

l-layhoe agreed. “We just wanted to make a fun
dance that we would enjoy doing and people will
hopefully enjoy watching," she said. “(When cho.
reographing a dance] there is more ofan oppotni.
nity to give input and feel a pert ofthe creation ofa
piece,"

After they made the decision to choreograph a duet, which neither
had done befotc, Beison reiterated to them that m a duet, the relationship
betwecn the two people has to be very (lean After brainstorming, diey
settled on an interaction between a ivire, Langan, and her husbands mis»
tress. Hayhoe, and set the dance to music from the Kronos Quartet. The
two women act out a battle over a men's dress shirt, which represents the
husband. Lungall explained the title ortheirdance “victor," saying, “When
we ﬁrst started, we were using a slreleton to hang the shirt one, and the
skeletons name was Victor." Despite the light—heartedness or their dance,
it does have a message, which Langan said is revealed at the end in the
womcns change ofatritudo.

The troupes spring performance, usually entirely professionally choc
tcographed and with twice as many Troupe mcmhers, has pushed the
group in new directions. “We lost a lot offanrastic dancers this semester,"
said Hayhoc, "but it's given us a diancc to get to know each other really
well and l thiulr mat we‘ve put together a good show," The Troupe rose to
the challenge presented hy its small size with increased flexibility and do

Concert Preview

Fresh Flutes Ensemble Concert
Sat, April 12 at 7:30 run. in Sebring—Lew-is

Thojury is still out on whether or not the name “Fresh
Flutes" is a good one for the Grinnell College ﬂute choir;
some think it’s lame, others lilre it because it isn’t simply
the “Grinnell College Flute choir." And the flute players at
Grinnell do indeed break out or traditional ensemhle and
section molds.

"At. other schools the ﬂute section is often the most
competitive section hecause there’s so many,” said Jane
Hooper "us, "but here we are all friends and we support
each other."

The group attended the iowa Flute Festival this semester
to perform, listen to other rlute theirs and attend master
classes. Elizabeth Azzolini ’06 noted that, compared to
many other players at the festival, "We don't wear enough
make-up as a section." rheothers laughed in agreement.

Most of the players in trash Flutes take lessons with
Kimberly Helton, who "strongly urges" her private lesson
students to participate in the group. Fresh Flutes has a
concert each semester, holds studio classes in which players
can listen to and critique each other, and hosts master
ciasses with professional flute players.

when asked about the music oi the ensemble, Rnsenow
cried out as ifin pain. “It’s awful," she said, 'Well, trying
to get all those flutes in tune is awful."

"It’s cutesy," said Jessica Fetertil '05. ”Sometimes it’s
really nice stufﬁnand often its really challenging."

uric oftile most unique things about the ilute players, at
least the ones who are in Symphonic Band, is that they
have rlule Dinner. "it star ted my freshman year," said
hosenow. “Emily Resseger ["02], Emily Mayor [‘01], and me.
That was it."

"1 some to a ﬂute dinner as o prospie," said Weller.
"when people at home asked me why i wanted to come to
Grinnell, it was deﬁnitely one of the things that 1
mentioned."

Azzolini, who also plays oboe, agreed that the
community that the ﬂute players offer is one reason why
she's not overly eager to switch back to oboe, "It sucks you
in gradually,” she said,

rite fresh flutes concert is Saturday, April 12, at 7:30
pm. in Scoring-Lewis. Next Sunday, April 20, the
Symphonic Band concert will include selections that
speciﬁcally feature the flute section. In May, the ensemble
will perform pieces that Ruserlow composed for her senior
composition project. '

Future acts

Lloyd expnssed the opinion that, for him, Trapped
could he as good as it gets. “This is the apes ofall success,"
he said. "This interview is as goodas it’s gonna get for me."

But Supim refused such limiting decisions and axe
pressed his desire to attract well.ltnown guest Stars: “Rickey
Henderson, the greatest lead-OFF hitter ofail time," Suplro
put at the top orhis list. "He's 43 and a jerk. His phllow»
phy is to answer as incoherenrly 3 possible."

Lloyd answered to Seapito’ssuggestioir. “Hatpo Mars,"
he said. “He was the quiet one, but that horn thing would
be really funny,"

Trapped is funny. Lloyd and Smipim lilte funny They
like Trapped in Darby, And they do, in fact, dream offur.
thcr radio hiyinlts and hroalting more possible barricts of
good taste.

“I generally rhinlt ifl’m going to he more successful,"
concluded Lloyd, "irivill be even more disgusting "

Szapiro also intimated success doesn’t luv: to mean
miss appeal, “I don't have any aspirations to be a house.
hold name," l|C said.

Tmppedwill conclude Forever at the end ofthis semes-
tcr. Until dien, Lloyd and Seapiro, though perhaps less
disgusting and more ivcll.ltnown then the future hopes.
will continue trapping their voices and shipping them our
