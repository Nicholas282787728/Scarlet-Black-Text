Raising the bar

by Brian Clites

President Russell Osgood was the highest-paid presi.
dcnt among all liberal arts collzges in the country in 2000.
2001. Each of the last two years, he has earned $100,000
mom than the $381,188 he made l’HS ﬁrst year at Grinnell
College. His compensation has been greater than that or
the president oittny ofGtinnell's selrdesignated “peer m7
stitntions" at any time in the period 1996r2001,

All colleges alc required to publicly releoe the com-
pensation orolriters, directors, trustees, and key employe
ces on the IRS form 990, Public access to the form genere
ally lags two years; the most recent information available
nationally is for the 2000-2001 year. Grinnell Treasutet
David Clay also released the college’s 2001-2002 form, alt
though the comparative information of other institutions
is not yet available.

According to each institution's information for 2000-
2001, the $481,255 Osgood received in total compensa-
tion was 68 pucclll more than the national median of all
private colleges, 43 percent more than the average or
Grinnell's peer institutions, 47 percent more than the pre—
vlous Grinnell president, and $85,704 more than the sec-
ond—hlghcstemmpcnsdtcd liberal-ans president in the ooun.
try, Gordon Haaiand otGettysburg College.

One Grinnell professor said the president’s salary is al»
ways on the minds of faculty members disciosing tight
budgets during meetings. it is hard to believe there is no
money {or more positions or for larger mises, the professor
said, when some administrators are so highly paid.

osgoods salary reﬂects the atmosphere in which he
was pursued and hired by Grinnell in 1993. The college's
Board ol'l'rustees, who are responsible for hiring the prtslr
dent and setting his salary, felt that Osgood was well worth
$350,000 his rookie year.

“We thought he was awesome," said board chairwoman
Caroline Little last week. “We wanted him to come, and
he came. He was getting a lot oroiters to go to other law
schools, and he could have stayed at Cornell; they were

not happy to see him go."

Another trustee reralled the same sentiment. “I think
he was by rat the first choice, not ,ust orrhe trustees, but of
a broad cross—section of the college Community," said Andy
Loewi. “He was in a position to compete wirh other insti.
tutions for his services, and we were deﬁnitely competing
for his senices in the marketplace." speaking as a lawyer
himsclt Loewi added, ”Russell is a man of extraordinary
legal talent .. he would command a salary easily Mice
what he makes in Grinnell were he to engage in the private
sector of law right now."

While Little and Loewi both recalled the enthusiasm
orthe board to attract Osgood, neither recalled discussion
of paying him well outside the range olcrinnell’s peer
institutions. on the mnmry, boda said his salarywris within
the scope otpeet institutions.

Referring to the current gap between Osgood's current
salary and other peers. Little said, “that was not the case
when Russell came." However, according to the total com»
pensation mch school reported in 1998-99, Osgood was
indeed the highest paid president among Gtinnell’s peer
institutions, by roughly 380.000,

speaking about oigood's present salary. Loewi said, “I
am quite tonrident that Ruscll is not the most highly com.
pensated president orasrnall liberal ans college." But based
on the Rs 990 for 2000701, president osgood appears to
be the highestcompensated president, oteluding the sow
emnce packages of three presidents who retired that year.

Osgoods salary has increased at the same annual per
Ccnt‘agc as is available to other faculty membewslnce
1990, his annual salary percentage increase has been her
tween 3.85 and i 30 percent. But because his initial salary
was to large. his total compensation has risen nearly
$100,000 over four years.

Although he has been eligible for bonioes. he has not
received any, “not because the board doesn’t think he der
serves it," said Little. “We think he is doing a really good

Grinnell activists use humor to turn anti-queer rally on its head

by Jen Walsh

"You can ﬂip me off, butyou can’t ﬂip off die truth!"
Gabe Rosenberg ’03 shouted to passetstby who gestured
at him from their cars in Iowa City last weekend. How-
ever, the “truth" Rosenberg appeared to be erpressing
seemed absurd, the sign he wricd read, “Fags atcn’t hu»
mans, they're when."

Rosenberg, along with Devin Lindsey '05 and lacy
Iverson ’06, traveled to Iowa City last Saturday to attend
the westboro Baptist Church: protest of The Lilian":
ijirl, a play about the 1998 murder of queer strident
Matthew Shepard,

But although the three oppose the church's anti-queer
message, they did not plan to your the 300 counterpro.
testers who gathered across thestrett from therhurch group.

Fred Rhelps st,

“We wanted to subvert the protest by engaging in age
grosive otite orit," explalned Rosenberg, who is himself
queer.To do this. the three stood on the same side orthe
street as the westboro protesters and played die roles of
overdue-top anti.gay protesters,

“we tried to stay in character and stick to our mes.
sages,” Rosenberg said.

In addition to Roscnberg's robot sign, Lindsey wore a
large orange hat and carried a sign that read, “God hates
rags and women without hats," alluding to sections orthe
Bible thatsrate that women should wear hats in the temple
and that the temple is everywhere,

iverson’s sign read simply, “Cod hates rags," but he wore
a sparkly pink haltertop with the word “angel" across the
front, he said.
