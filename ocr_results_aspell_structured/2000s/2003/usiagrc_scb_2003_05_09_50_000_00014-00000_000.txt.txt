I understand the plight of the toilet (logger. We've
all felt that knot in our stomach grow and grow as
the toilet water rose and rose. We’ve all had lucky
moments when the water slowly descends from the
top of the bowl and we've all been unlucky and have
Felt confusion, horror and panic as the water spilled
over the toilet bowl and landed where we stood mes
merized, Regardless of whether the water rose over
the bowl or not, one fact remains: the toilet is clogged
And when the toilet gets clogged, it’s everyone’s prone
lem. So while the horror of the experience may be a
lot to handle, I would ask that the toilet clogger ﬁnd
a way to unclog it, Whether this means getting the
plunger (oh! The humiliation!) or calling an RLC and
leaving an anonymous message, ﬁx the problem.

I’m intrigued by the Coalition orAnh‘ Racistwhites’
Sign which talks about how supermarkets at Grinnell
only cover localiood and WASP. food. 15 this to say
that the availability of food is a form of persecution?
In that case, I should declare that this entire com-
munity is persecuting me and my Italian heritage by
not offering a broad availability of cheap imported
extra-virgin olive oil, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and
the ﬁnest bruschettas at quad or cowles, I’m particu-
larly perturbed by the ﬁct that there are not lobsters
at every meal, as this is to deny my New England
room Iﬁnd it extremely offensive. Bring on the cul-
tural food!
