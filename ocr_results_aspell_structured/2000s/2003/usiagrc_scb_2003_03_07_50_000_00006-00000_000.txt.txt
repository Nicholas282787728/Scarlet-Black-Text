Rocky Horror: What is it and how did it

get here?

“RorlgvHomr is nor clean, inhibircd or straightelaced,”
casr member Adelia Chrysler ‘05 said, “nor is it chasre,
polire, PC or sensirive. .. ir's definircly nor quier, rural or
idylli lr's a release from rho heinously cerebral academic
torture we put ourselves through here [at Grinncllli”

And as Ellic Craig ‘04 remembers, Reriy Hamv‘begzn
at Grinncll when astudentwas doing mother kind ofstress-
release. In the fall (£1999, Shana Barchas ’01 was “color-
ing with cmyons," Craig said, “and she had one riiar said
magcnra. It struck her rhar shc wanrcd ro be Magenra."

Not rhc color, bur rho chamcrerin Rocky/4077177. Gmdue
ally, by rho spring ofzooi, Bachas had a group oririends
together and ready ro perform. Thar yur, Craig parricir
pared as aTimewarpet (a dancing chorus memberlv Alison
Williams '04 Wu acring in a play wirh Ranches in 2000,
and remembers being rold Hey, you should be laner in
Rocky Horror next yer. She was.

This year. Craig and Williams are oo.direcring R0547
Horror. Bccaiisc Craig was srudying orhcampus lasr rail,
Williams oversaw rhe ast rocruirmenr process. She had a
srarion ar rhe opening aeriviries en. csrabiished an email
lisr, pur up posrers and ser mccting datesr Arrcndces ar rlie
ﬁrst meeting viewed the Film, heard from previous Grin-
nell Reedy Horror parrieipanrs and decided how rhey
vvanred ro parriciparo.

The group garhercd for weekly viewings orrhe movie
in Gardner lounge. These mceilngs served to help the
casr loam rhe nuances otrhe movie characrcis‘ movemenr
Craig nored rhis year's rasr has “mixed experience levels,"
wirh “abour half" familiar wrrli roe/o Hoiwr previously

Craig said she and Williams inrcnrionally rriod ro mix
up rlic usual gender roles rhis year. They also boda agreed
RM day Horrovsccms ro cause crossing in general. For ex.
ample, Chrysler plays Frank, rho male disrorred master—
mind" ofrhc ensemble, bursrill wears acorser, ihigh highs,
and high heels. Barrell plays Magenra, a French maid
docked our accordingly in rlae sexy domesric dress.

“lr's inreresring,“ Craig said. “Whoever shows up ar
rlie moorings is rhe show, and you never know whar rhar’s
going ro be in the end 1r ends up diiteronr on io own.
Everyone picks up on diiierenr nuances ora character." in
addirioii to diracring, Craig is performing as Janer, the in.
noccnr newlywed, andWilliams as Columbia, rhe groupie.

The show gers help from SGA and ACE for funding
and assembling prop bags ro give ro audience members,
Williams said “We buy a lot of our own costumes, be-
cause we wanr ro keep them."

Williams norcd her biggesr concern is “rhar a cosrume
will fall oﬂ’."

Craig nodded and said wirh raised eyebrows, “There
are a lor oismall costumes."

indeed, Anne Packard '05, costumc manager, said her
job mainly Involves “making sure all rho underwear hrs
corrccrly."

An actor prepares

Many orrhe srandard ihr-arer proparaiion praerico are
missing rrom rhe lorry Hm'mr preparaiion. Because each
rasr member mimics or mirrors eraerly whar rhe chines
tcrs are doing in rho rilm, riaining mainly involves wareh.

.ng rho movie. Over and over,

in rhe beginning, rhe oar mer in Gardner Loung: for
weekly viewings. In February, they mer rvvire a week; this
pass week, rhey‘ve garnered every nlghL

Chrysler said rhc ﬁrst time she saw rlic movie, in fifth
grade, slic rhoughr ro herself, “This is rhe weirdesr rhiag
I’ve overseen." But shakeprwarohing it and esrimares she’s
now seen it more than 80 rimcs.

Battcll csrimarcs hes seen Rocky more rhan 100 rimes
“I could easily, from rhc very beginning, recire ir he said.

But us nor so easy being perrecr mimics.

You donr have to invear movemenr because it's ale
ready rhcrc," Chrysler said, “But rhc hardesr rhing is ro
copy what's there." Because her characrcr is on screen ror
riie mayoriry ordae riim, Chryslersaid she had to rake carer
rul aore orrhings like “wiierher or nor he his his rigiir arm
or his ierr when he's making speeches."

“It's not a rypieai process.“ said Barrell. “bemuse you
really don‘r have rhar much choice as a characrer"

Bancll is a ran orCraig's and Williams's choice ro en.
courage as many cross.gcndcr roles as possible rhis year.
He suggosrcd his Magenra costume could serve as rhc tcae
son to see rheshow, and said wiar exaggerarod bias, “Hands
down, Magenia is die coolesr characrer."

But Barreil also said Rocky is a greai aciiag experience
because rhere are no regimenred divisions within rhe easr.
Transiiioning from one role ro rhe orher is always a “quick
learn," Barren said, “There are no nonrun perrorrnanees."

Craig agreed. "This produerion as a whole is really dlfr
rerenr from a ior of rhearer perrorrnanres.” she said. The
people dircering. making cosrumes, performing, making
props, are me same people. It’s more a grass roors reel rhan
a hierarchy,"

And though Williams adinirrcd rhcre are nighrs she
doesn't warn ro be doing all arose rhings, onoc rlre music
srarrs her mood is rransrormed. “Everyone jusr has loo or

energy and rhar’s whar
makes it run.”

The audience experience

Arrcnding viowuags ofthe Rocky Horror Picture Show
in costume and among considerable Crowds became a
countercultutal (ml: in rhe lare i97os. Many rhearers
showed rhe movie evcry nighr, though mosr have ceased ro
do so, the interest and mil for the any continues. “It really
is a cuirz" Bartell said wirh borh shock and glee, “People
really do go to rhis religiously."

But if one is new ro rhe Rot/z] religion, wliar should
one expect?

“Be ready ro indulge in camp," Bartcll said.

“Don’r be afraid ro see people in droir underwear,"
Chrysler said, “or be in your underwear."

"Teddies are the norm," Bartell noted,

“Everyone lcrs rheinsclves go," said Chrysler, “People
go nun. You don’t even need to be drunk."

Craig and Williams clariﬁed rhar any outﬁt goes for
audience members, usually dressed or unusually undressed.
“Come dressed." said Craig, “or nor. Lingerie is srrongiy
encouraged."

An audience member is encouraged ro rulrill rwo spe-
cific duties: yell out the caiibacilki‘landed out on a printed
scriptvznd dispense, ar rho indicared rimes, objects in rho
prop bag, like roasr, newspaper, confetti and birrhdayhars.

Those involved do acknowledge that what Rﬂrky Hor-
mr celebrates, and what its audience and fans celebrate, is
somewhat nebulous and hard to describe in words. But
rhcy sec rhis as rhc reason pcoplc go and rhe reason rhcy
help orearc a place for people ro go, ifanyrhing, rhe linc
“don’t dream it, be it," from one ofthe movie’s ﬁnal songs,
has come to decode what the Ricky Hmwr Pic/me S/mu
communicares.

“It has to do with giving in to one‘s fantasies," said
Craig.

“It is an experience,” concluded Bartell, “Ifyou‘ve never
seen it live, you don’t know \Vi‘mt you’re missing."
