Bill Sanger never intended to farm
full-time. Fifteen years later he's
growing exotic crops and travelling
to six farmers markets a week.

That's how bill Sager, an earthy—looking man with reddish
whiskers and overalls cxplarncd the cornucopia ofproduce

it's not something hc really planned.

When he bought two acres of land, Bill in»
tended [0 build u structure to srorc Iris consuuc»

going. “In the meantime." hc snrd, “what do you

one or the six rnrrners markers he sells or. Sunday
is his only day off.

“I used to soy there one three people workrrrg:
me, myselfand I,” smiled Bill “And we all work
40 hours a week "

Despite his hard work, Bill's hobby has never
been a subsranual source of income. “I couldn’t
live on what I do here," he explained ”I have some
investments [hat do that.”

Bill is one ofmzny sellers at Grinnell‘s farmers
market, heldThursdays in Central Park from 3-6
pm. until Oct. 20. “There’s n lot orcompctrriun
in [his business. A lot," Eill said, glancing at the
surrounding tables pried with the fruirs and Vegv
crables or the orhergrowers. This competition
helps to kucp prices fair. According (cl Bill, whnr

Another big seller for bill is his specially Culti-

season that ends around June 20. In September,
the sight or the green spikes evoke expressions of
surprise and delight in many or Bill's customers.

”You shrp these guys in [rpm Australia, Bill?”

bill aims to pierce his customers not only through
