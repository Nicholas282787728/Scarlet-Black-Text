The idea behind PBS was to provide a study break and a
second dinner to students when the dining halls are closed
and hunger pangs have made a comeback. With their
barbeque parties, the PBS hopes to promote socializa-
tion, entertainment and a stress-free Grinnell. The food
and drinks are tree and they plan to host barbecues even
in the middle of the winter. "So far, there has been a large
amount of positive encouragement from the SGA and stlr
dents,” said Schneider.

Meeting: James 3'6 lounge, 7 p.nr. every Wednesday
To get involved: e-mail [letching]

Letthinger started this group to "spread the gospel or ﬁsh
ing." When the academic and social pressures or Grinnell
start to build up, there's nothing he likes to do more than
to head out to Arbor Lake or Krumrn Forest Preserve with
his rod and tackle box, he said. He aims to get as many
people into ﬁshing as possible and to organize regular
ﬁshing trips on the weekends. "I guarantee that even]
single member of the AAG will catch a ﬁsh before ﬁshing
season is over,“ Letchinger said.

LACROSSE

The leaders or this group were inspired by the women's la-
crosse team that started last year. McNearney and Kelley hope
to recruit as many people as possible, regardless or previous
experience and to play with surrounding colleges. Practiceis
not mandatory and conditioning will be optional. The group
members just "want to have a good time," McNearney said.

class differences on campus, the three leaders of GESD
are working to increase awareness of issues concerning
those who are ﬁrst generation college students or from
working-Class families. They also aim to increase services
and resources that address the needs of such students.
”There are no groups on Cam pus that speak to social difr
rerentes or work to bridge the social gaps on our cam—
pus,” said roomey '06. "We want to raise awareness on
campus and make sure that resources and students are
united.”
