A new assisranr dean has already been hired. Adrienne
Enriqucz will assume the post in oerober. Arrer graduat-
ing from crinriell, Enriqllcz oarrieioared in Teach For
America and rhrn received her rnasrer's degree in
mulrieulrural srudies rrom rlir Universiry orlviiamr. She
eurrrnrly runs an arrrrerehool program in her homerown
oil’urtlundi ore.

“She doesn'r have any dirrer admirrions experience. our
good relaied experience," surnner said. “were very bone
mistlc."

while rlre upward rrends are good signs oroiogress for
rhe admissions omee, rniilrienlrural snidenrr aren’rsnre rhar
rlris is a sign orreal change.

“1 think iris groar rhar we have so many new srndenrs
ofcolor," Correerned Black Srudenrs (c135) nrenilsar Brandi
Green '05 said. “bur l think they’ll rare rhe rarne problems
as multicultural srudenrs in classes before." She added rhar
“a lor orrhrnr will reel rhar rhoy don’r hnv: rnueh ore vorre
on campus."

Adam Aguirre ’06 agreed. “You’re nor solving any .se
sires by iusr bunging in more people,” rhe Srudenr organ
niunoli orLarinos and Larinas head ofpublieiry said, “the
same issues will srill be rhere,”

Srill, arrer eonrroversy invoivlng lasr spring’: GUM
humor magazine srirred up rnulrieulrural diseonrenr on
earnous, most mulrieulrural srudenrs are hoping rhar more
people will prove helpful ro rhose already on earnnus. "The
ﬁshy/ears will be able ro ronrribure a lor ro rhe campus,"
CBS hirrarian Mahi Deniessie 'oo raid.

But while mosr are happy wirh rhe inﬂux ornew sru.
denrs oreolor, few were fully satisﬁed by eiirrenr numbers.

“I think the adminisrrarion realizes we need ro be more
diverse 1 think rhey need ro eonrinue bringing in more
srudenrs ofzolor,” Green said.

The Admissions Ofﬁce seems ro agree rhar rhis is nor a
oealr or even a rrlareau, “our socioeconomic and religious

diversiry is good," Sumner said, “but our erhnre diversiry is
not."

”It's nor where we wanr ro be, bur It's a good son,"
Sumner said. Sumner eurrenrly aims ro reaeh rwanry per—
cent multiculturztl enrollmenr in rha‘nexr round or rirsr
years. “we are eommrrred to ar lean grrring rhar murh."

leleally, rnulrieulrural srudenrs would someday aeeounr
for ”something approaching one-third orrlresrudenr body,"
said Sumner. “But that’s me talking; rhar number hasn't
ofﬁcially been anieulared by rho institution."

presidenr Osgood expressed similar sonrirnenrs, though
he did nor onerrxaer figures. "Myview is rhar you lookzt
rhe overall oooiilarion, rhen you look ar whar our peers a.r
able ro do," Presidenr Russell Osgood said. “Thar infm‘v
marion has rended ro leave us on rhe low side" in rerrns or
rnulrieulrural srudenrs. He added rhar rlre sehool has no
ser nirrnber ofminorltics in mind eaeh year.
