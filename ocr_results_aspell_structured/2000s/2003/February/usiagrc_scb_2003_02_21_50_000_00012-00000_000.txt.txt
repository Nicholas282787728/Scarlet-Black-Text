. on Feb. 21, 1950, the hrst International
,r/ Pancake liace was held in liberal, Kansas,
\ The annual event takes place on Shtove
Tuesday (Maidi Gras) and pits the women of tibeml
againstthe women of Olney, England. Wearing dresses and aprons,
their heads covered in scarves, the women run 415 yards with a
pancake on a skillet, which they must flip at least twice during
the races (The current score is liberal 27, Olney 24.)

Among tourists, Libelal’s other claim to tame is the Dorothy house,
a loose replica of hhe house from 1939's The Wizard of Oz, The
house is especially lively on the second weekend in October, when
surviving actors from the movie's Munchkinland Show up to
panicipate in an annual parade and carnival known as "attest."

sharon Oslmlme's favoritesong is John lennon's ”Imagine," which,
she explains on hills website. cameout when she and her husband
were hist danng “It became our song,“ she says.

"imagine” was one of no entries on a list of songs with potentially
troubling lyrics circulated by a radio program director at clear
channel Communications in the aftermath oi Sept, 11. Also on
the list: Edwin Starr's "War," tat Stevens’s ”Peace Train," and louis
Armstrong’s ”What a Wonderful World,”

In some new Christian hymnals, the old hymn “Morning has Broken”
Isn't accompanied by its traditional arrangement—instead, the
credit goes tn [at Stevens, who updated the tune for his 1971
version of the song (which was, incidentally, also on the clear
channel list).

”Anacreun in heaven,” the old song that provided the tune for
Francis Scott keys "The Staropangled banner," is about the creek
poet Anacreon, who died in no exit. at age as when he choked
on a grape. Poems that imitate Anacreon (generally by celebrating
women and/or wine) are called "anacteontic."

Three famous anachronisms: l) in Homers time, ”Hellas” referred
only to a small area in northern Greece, but once the rrord came
to refer to all oi Greece, literary works about homeric heroes
began referring to all Greeks as "helleflic." 2) One passage in the
Torah refers to the "kings of Israel,” though that section of the
Bible professes to have been wntlen long beioie any king oflsiael
existed. 3) Animal house was set in mm, but kent “Flounder”
