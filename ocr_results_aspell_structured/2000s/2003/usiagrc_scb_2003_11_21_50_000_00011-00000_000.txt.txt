The guy to beat

1 ﬁnd ir ironic rhar many have cccused Howard Deans “polirics
ofanger" es being dlvlsiv:. when ir appears rhar he is acrnally worle
mg ro unire people. He has, in her, unired :lll ofrhe orher candidaees
(.md rheirsupporrers) againsr him. in rhe debares, in rheir advcrtis»
ing, even in her week's 5&3. Why IS that? is ir because Dean is yusr a
reinble guy who hills hirrens in his baeLyard and secrerly errcnds
HirlerYourh nieerings2

Well, no.

lie because rhe orher candidares see Dean as rhe guy ro bear, and
ifrhar means taking rhings our ofconrexr or blowing rhings why our
of proporrion. rhnr’s nppsrenrly fine.

iwould cneoumge everyone ro do some independenr rcseereh on
rhe candidares before rho caucuses, I'm nor going ro rell you who ro
yore for, l iusr hope rhar you melee an informed decision when you
do vore, and beware of hyperbole from any side.

Kerry assumes ignorance

Kn a Gibel Azauluy

I decided m arrend iohn Kerry's rampnign (qu
on Sunday afternoon. 1 wanied m see, up close,
how he would hendle his audience e would he
offer rhe same plarform speech heaid on C»Span
and NPR or somerhing more thoughtrprovoking
end befirring an academic :ul-
dience, isrood, waired and lise
rened end an nowconfidenrly
declare: rhc only way I miglir
vore for Kerry would be ifrhe
choice is between him or Bush
(bur since he's nailing in rhe
race for Demoeraric nominee,
’I'm acruelly nor overly con»
corned). ifi had srayed home,
I mighr nor have hed sudi an
averse reaerion 7 so irs prob.
eblygood rhnr I wenr. l found
borh his answer on how Africa
would ﬁt inro his foreign policy end his answer on
Charlie Rangers proposal for a drafr m be an infu-
riaring hur insrruerive example or liheml pmconc
ceprions at besr and prejudice or worsr; eirher woy,
heseemed io assume rhar his audience wcs nor well
informed.

1) As a preface io answering rhc quesrion on
Africa, Kerry poinred our rhar his wife was from
Mozambique and lived rhere unril shewas 24 when

low tolerance for people,
including policians, who
smugly think they can
insult one's intelligence

and get away with it.

her family's properey was coiihscired by rhe dicme
rorsliip. Why rl ould rhis smremenr, wirhonr qualie
ricoion or add onal dcml. be offered es evidence

spouse’s family properry would have been losr afrer
rhe miliiary coup in i>ornigal leel ro ihe collapse of
rhe colonial goyornmenr in Mozambique.

earnesr in 1974, drier rhe
coup. The counrry became in.
dependenr in 1975 under rhe
government of FRELIMO,
rhe lending libeiarion mew
menr. end was lead by Pro
deni samoia Machel (his
widow, Grace, is a poliriml ﬁgv
nro in her own righr, is now
memed ro Nelson Mandela),
Those who chose re move from Moumblquc ro
scurh Africa knowingly chose ro live under rho
whire aparrheid governmenr nnd rhe immediiire
wirhdrawsl oiporruguese from Mozambique, ime
mediarely end aversely impacred rho poliiicel
economy. There weresomewhires who didchoose
ro remain as commiired acrivisrs whose lives were
lirerally on rhe line. Bur inreresringly enough, Kerry
never explicitly informed his audience where his

wires family hi wirhin Mozambique's experriarc
Perrugnese communiry. Evidenrly he did nor lake
inm ieeounr ihar some ofhis audience would he
more informed ihen be presumed 7 perheps he
caleulered, given rhe paeleed room and shoir
amounr of nine, iher no one would osle him ro
elaboiaro on his perenrherienl prefarory reimrlcs rher
his wife “nus born in Moiniiibieyne and lived rheie
unril she was 24 when ihe dicriiroiship conﬁscared
her family's properly."

2) lnslied Kerry wheihci he snpporred cherles
Rnngcl's proposol for a narionnl drair. Rangel (D-
NY) is rhe Ranking Member ofrhe commirioe on
Ways md Means, Chairman of rho Board of rho
Demoeiarie Congressional campaign Commirree
and Dean of rho New York shire congressional
Delegniion. He iepiesenrs New voile's 15rh con-
gressional disrricr, imporrsnrly, Congressman
Rnngel sewed in rhe us. Army from 194852,
during which rime he foughe in Koren and was
awarded ihe Purple Hearr and Bronze Srar, Con»
giessman Rangcl proposed legislnrion io renew rhe
drafr, noiing rhar rewofhis eongiessionnl collengues
have children serving in rhe niilimry, while poor
and woilong class American kids are overrtprc»
sensed in rhe volunreer forces. in orher words, nor
only would a nerionel drafr creaie a broader sense
ofnarional solidariry, bnr a loge sceror of rhe pub'.
lie, rhose wirh class leverage _ would nor be so
complecenr abour how rhe milirary is deployed if
rheir children were in uniform and waning re be
sonr inro berile.

Kerry’s laeldusrer and longwinded response
cgeinsr Rdngcl's proposal erenrually oamc re resr
on a reference ro enlisred soldiers from Sourh Cane
mil. Dcmmand Harlem, in rhe context ofhis per
lineal speech specifically addruxcd ro an over
whelmingly “white" eudienee ar o welhendowed
liberal arrs college, Kerry's reply was surprisingly
disingenuous. perhaps he milorcd ir ro prccnncepe
rions aboiir how ro enswer 1 qucstlon from one of
rhe less-dialn-lnndful ofbrown feces in rho audi.
ence. Did he essume. hosed on my appesrence, rhnr
i would have an Exclusive concern wirh inner-cir—
ics? Why didn’r he include in his exemples, rural
Weerirginia (remember Jessica Lynch), Kenruclcy
or Tennessee? Wherever arrirudes were revealed in
his reply, rhe fact is rhar he skillfully but impru-
denily eveded rhe specific socioeconomic and dc.
cidcdly class issue which Rangel hes been promor.
ing for public arrenrion. Morwvcr. in his (nor-so)
subrle racialized response, Keny seems ro hove for
gorren rhar righr here in lowa, rhc overwhelming
niaioriryofenlisred men end women (nor iusr from
rhe Narioncl Guard) are whire and worldngrclass.

I have an odmireedly low rolernnee for people,
including polirieians:who smugly ihink rhey can
insulr ones inrelligenee end ger away wirh in I am
consoled by rhe knowledge ihar as she saying goes,
one can fool nil rho people some ofrhe rime end
some of rhe people all rhe rime, bur one mn't fool
all rhe people ell rhe rime.
