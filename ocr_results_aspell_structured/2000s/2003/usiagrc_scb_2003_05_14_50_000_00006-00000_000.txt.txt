Friends recall Raxter’s voices and giggles

Jonathan, cont. from p. 5

he hung our in Rnwsnn plr during their ﬁrst year, “H:
was great because he could look at you for two minutes,
pi. .rcricilly, and you knew rliar he was looking or you
and what you were going through, when no one else
seemed to notice whar was going on. because everyone
gets really caught up on their own thing ﬁrst year, she
said. “He was just 2 great Ilstzncr,"

His friends remomhor him as being quicr, bur have
ing a lor to my “He was so sweet He was also really
sensitive, and softespoken, bur dcnnirely not without
his opinions," Brlgugllo said, “He had this way of just
slipping thorn in so dryly, and that was part ofhis sense
ofhumor."

However, his rriends have thought since rhar rhey
weren't gclnng the whole picture. Talking to him,
Nichols said, “you sort of got rhe feeling that he occae

sronally wouldn't say everything that was on his mind."

Bur one friend recalls rhe night she first met him,
sitting innlounge, talking and crylngabour family “He
said that his dad never caught him how to ride a bi.
cycle," she said. “I always figured someday he’d learn
and that would be cnrhnrrlc for hint

Thinking about Rnxrer now has changed rheir per.
eepnons, nnorl ier friend said lsorr of picture him in
retrospect jusr unsatisﬁed with everything."

Even though friends say that he didn't talk abour
rhe future much, they see rhar Raster could have been
successful. “He wasn't really forrhnghr about it, but he
was a good leader," Mills said. “He was really good at
organizing and raising control.”

Naturally, he had a certain sryl: in his leadership.
“He’d always book us hotels ior Quizbowl and he would
find rhe seedlesi places," Mills said. “Bur we had way

more fun in rhese rar traps than we would have in any
nice place."

since his death, Raxrer‘s iriends have come to ap
precinre more fully what he meanr to rhe people around
him. ”What really srrllces me now is rhe number of
people that have stories about him, who have been re.
ally close to him,” Nichols said. “I rhrnlc he really made
an impacr on a lor of people ,usr by being an amazing
guy and a really good friend."

“He was the only person here rharl felt like, when.
ever i saw him, l just wanted to give him a big hug,"
Mrlls said. “I don't know what il: was,"

“He was one ofrhose people you pass on the srrcec
and go, ‘Jonarhanl' as opposed to ‘l—ley Jonathan,"-
Briguglio said. “I don't knowifihar explains his person.
ality, but to me rhar docs."

Remembering
jam n

he taught me thati shouldn'talways drive in overdrive, I didn’t realize
this until i was dnving with him, and he said, ”Why are you driving in
overdnvei" And l’m like, ”I always dnve in overdrive.” ln high school this
blond liieguard that i vras friends with, she told me to drive in overdrive
because it was better for the car ursumething. So ever since, ioraboutiour
years. i was driving in overdrive. he taught me that above 45 is overdrive,
not under 45, l was telling that story on Saturday and [Suzyj Snmagin '03

was like, "Really?" So he's still teaching people how to dnve.

Even if the two of us were in the midst oi talking about how bad we
felt, he could turn our sadness into silliness until the two at us were gig.
gling uncontrollably. his infectious humor could magically overpower even
the darkest of days. Jonathan’s ﬁrst year at Grinnell was a pretty hard year

for both at us, but looking back i can only remember the laughter.
in particubiri can remember sitting iin'th him in the Dibble laundry
room, his words distracting rne iron the world of academics as we created a
fantasy world for ourselves. tine night while enjoying the sweetness oiin-
toxicated snacking, we had discovered the Munchies, a green slimy species
peoecutcd by the Gnnnell community. That day in the laundry room we
wandered away irom the worn out complaints about our eveirincredsing
workload and brought these sotkeating creatures to his. We rambled about
them for hours that day and in the remaining weeks oithe semester. making
up ndiculous lives for them that no one but the two of us could appreciate.

Just a few days aiter our iirst meeting, 1 saw him in the hall and l
greeted him with a big, "Hello Mr. llaxter," He seemed glad that 1 had
remembered his name. i was pretty impressed myself because i usually have
at least a ﬁve—second deLay in recalling most anybody/s name and this is
really too long to be oi any use, but he had taken pains lo point out that
even he thought Raxlei was an uncommon and tncky name, so of course
this helped me to remember it almost immediately. he soon became a famil-
iar face in the hath/cs department.

—ltoyce Wolf, Mathematics

Jonathan Raxler was a student in my advanced mathematics course in
held theory. I want to share vnth you some oi my impressions in hopes that
these thoughts will help some of his hiends.

Jonathan was a talented mathematics student. he was not always able
to concentrate on completing his mathematics assignments. i understand
irom his inends that he worked in spurts. After his not having done some
key assignments in my class. he did a beautiful job on the first exam in my
course. What is remarkable is that without the beneﬁt at comments on the
assignments, he had been able to masterthis maten'al on his own. When i
handed back his exam and congratulated him, he got a shy but proud grin
on his face. he had a winning smile.

Jonathan was a gentle person. he was inendly and unusually sensitive
to others’ feelings. When he realized thatthe smoke on his jacket made me
cough, he left his jacket on the bench outside my oihce when he came to
see me. last week when 1 had problems with my back, he asked about me
and told ion to wish me well. In class sessions when we worked in small
gmups or gave presentations, he was supportive of his fellow students.

I mourn the tragic loss oi this gentle, talented person. And despite the
sense oi loss, I am grateful to have had him as my student

irememberthe inst time ! heard about him, i heard about him through
Sarah, and he'd drive Sarah [Watson] to Wdl-Mal't to pick up some sort oi

shampoo, and i remember hean‘ng about this incredibly nice guy
who, was, like, letting this old lady sit in iront of him for ten min-
utes, like, to go through the aisles, and he was just sitting back and
waiting his turn, and Sarah said, ”You have to be assertive. Just grab
the shampoo, its okay.” So I remember thats the first time I heard
about him. i don't quite remember the first time I met him, At the
veny beginning oi ﬁrst year, though.
he was very creative, too. he invented vnth some other people,
he invented these little green monsters called Munchies that lived in
the laundry room in Dibble that ate everyone's socks. I remember
doing laundry With them, and they were just like, Who munchies. ihe
munchies are going to get that.”

He ivas a really good card player. he had this fantastic ability to
shoot the moon when playing hearts. he loved to play cribbage,
practically every day.

I met him at the first iloor study break, andi immediately picked
him out as someone 1 would like, and I thought, that person, right
there, I’m gonna hang out vn‘th that person. And i don't really
remember how we started hanging out, butit happened pretty guickly,
and after that, I spent tons and tons oi time with Jonathan. We
spent a lot oitime in each others rooms and hung out together all
the time. his iacial expression was like the expression of a depressive
and oi someone who had a certain sort oi sarcastic, ironic, morbid
sense of humor [was like, i can relate to that person.

edstnd llall ’04

i remember ireshman year I had a really bad experience with
Disco, and i went to his room. he just let me cry and hugged me. I
had a stupid gold necklace on that i couldn't get oii, and he took it
off for me and threw it across the room.

i would also like to express my sadness about Jonathan
Raxter, as he lived in horns his hot year. 1 will always remember
his thoughtinlness and his sweet Southern accent he loved
playing with my cat, Bella, and watching iv in the Morris lounge
With his friends. My thoughts go to his mother, speciﬁcally, as l
have talked with her and i know she loves her son deeply.

' danslle lunch, RLC

he and liz hulse used to watch movies in Rawsorl lounge. iheyd
occasionally take entire days ofi. One time, i came in and they were
cuddled up, walching a movie. This bat came in and the two Uithem
were just shrieking like little tiny girls, hiding under the blanket,
huddled together in absolute tear of this bat.

We hung out a lot last year too in ltead pit. he always said he
was the worst SA. in a non-smoking floor, he smoked in his room.
The iioor always reeked oi cigarette smoke.

once we tried to make our own long island ice Teas. ihey were
disgusting concoctions, about so percent hard liquor. icouldn't dnnk
it, but he didn’t have a problem.

‘En'n Nichols '02

One day, we decided we wanted new jobs, so we looked through
the paper in town. I remember we skipped across the parking lot, all
happy that we were getting real jobs. but nobody was hiring. he got
a job as a bookkeeper for a trucking company. he would come home
with crazy stories and junk toad. ihey would send him home with
pieces or Snickers cake — really crazy junk food v he‘d be like,
”Come and eat some at my food.” And he’d tell us about the crazy
truckdrlvers and the chdlncsmokmg women he worked with.
