Francis ﬁrst proposed eliminating rlorrn com»

puter lahs during an SGA meeting in April
2002. Several SGA ofﬁcials and many students
ohiecred to the proposal, questioning whether it
was appropriate to remove these computer lahs and
expect incoming students to buy their own coin-
puters.

iTS closed two computer lahs during rlrczool-
2002 academic year: Cowles oomputer lab was
closed to make room For a kosher kitchen, and
Carnegie lah was closed and converted into olrioe

surrey by the Higher Education Research institute
showed that only 3.5 persons oFcollege freshmen
surveyed oonsidered magazine rankings “very inie

“I looked at [college rankings] hut they didn’t
really inﬂuence me one way or another," Liz car

gust, two unwelcome men with no alrrhation to
the college were spotted anal asked hy security to
leave. The incidents nccllrred on August 21 and
August 27, and in both instances the mystery men
mused problems that earn pus security guards were
forced to resolve. one orthe men was found near
the Noyce Science Building, and the other was
found near Carnegie Hall

“They were people who should not have been
here and they have heen told not to come back.”
said Drtctror ofseeurity Steve hriscoe. one orthe

welcome intrusions midc, Briscoe called Gl'inncll
