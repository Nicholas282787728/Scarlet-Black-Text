Zombies attack

28 Days Later (R)

B: zombies, like pirates, are a diseased
minority group that get rather sick movies made
about them. 25 Days lam, however, is the 21st
century antidote to all that ails :ombies. in
present day iondon, zombies emerge from their
outcast status in society to become the majority
group, thanks to a very infectious disease called
Rage. struggling with their newround minority
status, rive people band together to try to
maintain the cultural dominance ofpeoplc that
don't eat brains.

16 Director Danny Boyle makes sure this
movie's no disaster like The Beach. This movie is
{asepaced enough to ring you breathlessly from
the deserted hospital to
the cotpsccﬂooded
church to the last fortress
of non»zombied
mankind, Employing all

with lots otgorc and a

manages to escape the
“thumbs down." it stays
true to what it's supposed
to be, a purely entertains
ing movie without a
pretentious big message aimed at morally
deprived viewers.

B: i agree with you that 28 Dior IA!”
ascends past honor derivatives and is actually an
enjoyable srary movie, but I think you’re still
selling it short. Boyle takes these terrifying
trappings and has them express eloquent
emotions, For the story, he didn't have to show

through the deserted streets orLondon, but he
did. This classic scene shows jim chillingly nftaid

or being alone more resonantly that Tom Cruise's
stroll through Times Square in Merritt: Sty could.
This story didn’t require the strong, perhaps
heavyhantled critique on gender in the second
halfof the ﬁlm, but I think it is much richer for
it. Horror movics' prime objective is to horriry,
which this movie does plcnty of. but the desolate
setting allows Boyle to make poignant comments
that a zombie-less, people-filled film cant. i
mean, when else are you going to see four people
go through a grocery store all by themselves to
stock up on irradiated fruit?

Ishould take a step back from my own high-
minded notions orrilm, and remind you that this
ﬁlm is “run." the way a scary movie can be. No.
it's not the scariest collection oiimagcs ever put
to film. Boyle was working with a tight budget,
but the grainy digital video often works in his
favor, sort oflikc in The Blair Witch Project. still.

)3: Why would any guy
ever go see this movie? it's
about two women (Kate Hudson and Naomi
Wam), who, although rather attractive, spend
the whole movie in Paris, worrying about boys
and stuit I mean, if they were ﬁghting aliens,

then maybe I’d go see it. Why else? Sure, it could
be a solid piece othimmaking illuminating the
subtle cultural differences between men and
women, Americans and Frenchics, but is that
really what most people, and by people I mean
men, want out ofa movie?

K: Brad, that’s so sexist! The ida behind Lhc
ﬁlm should be pretty good: a nice script that
integrates the cultural nuances ofsophistimted
Fans and chic California would do the trick and
the natural ﬂow of events should take care of
luclft But still. you're right: this movie falls ﬂat.
The script is a jumble of badly pronounted
French and frustratingly inane comments about
art and fashion; the characters get lost in overly
complex personalities that a notrsogenius plot
ﬁnds hard to trim off,

And man, that Kat: Hudson is so boring! But
i’m not surprised, because most Kate Hudson
movies rarely stray away from blondc stereotypes.
No matter how wellcdtesscd and cultivated she
tries to pass herselfoitas. she painn a bad
portrait oiwomen in general. In Le Divorce, she’s
an idle, classy hot chick ﬂying to Paris for moral
support much needed by a pregnant sister who
can't reconcile with her playful mari anymore, To
complicate the bland storyline, the uncle of the
father falls in love with this Californian dazzlcr.
which leads to some troubles as well as hilarious
situations. Then, in true Parisian fashion, a
tamous piece otart is discovered and sparks
dispute. Overall, to Divorce a nice picture of
how Hollywood sometimes can be ridiculous.

B: Like I said, not enough ﬁsticuﬁs. While it’s
05 the topic. I must mention that Kate Hudson
is awesome in Almost Famom. Now thercs a good
movie with hot women.

The Straight Story (G)

K: From Iowa cornﬁelds to Wisconsin lakes
on a '66 john Deere: This iytitail movie follows a
73.year.old man’s physical, and at the same time
philosophial, journey to a family reunion upon
hearing that his longttlmemorsee brother had a
stroke Along the way, he encounters people with
whom he shares the wisdom that mellows at his
age. Hey End, why are movies oisubstanee
always played on a projector in a badly-chaired
room at 10:30 on a Friday night?

B: Ambiance.

The movie CetAmooeLa explores the
relationship between famous Frchh writers
Marguerite Duras (jeanne Motcau) and Yann
Andrea (Aymetic Dematigny). The entire movie
is dominated by Moreau’s portrayal of Dutas as
an aging, alcoholic and neurotic master. This
shouldn't be surprising since she has portrayed
Duras' alter egos in previous ﬁlms (Modem
cam/1H1: and The Sailor ﬁnm Gibraltar) and was
close friends with Jean Cocteau, Jean Genet,
Henry Miller, Anais Nin and Duns herself

in Truiraut's fulex andﬁm, Moreau cxempli»
tied how French New wave Sex symbols were
always so much more interesting than anything
America ever produced. By being intelligent and
in touch with an irrational existential core, New
Wave ﬁlms evoked a sensuality born out
exuberance and angst simultaneously. She is
quoted as saying "iryou don't give a damn, men
look at you."
Forty years later,

Also, the tendency to emphasire lapse into
crypto.poctic statements about the meaning of
love and art at the expense or plot and
storytelling mean that this movie will alienate
just about anybody whos already alienated by the
idea ofsccing a “French” movic.
