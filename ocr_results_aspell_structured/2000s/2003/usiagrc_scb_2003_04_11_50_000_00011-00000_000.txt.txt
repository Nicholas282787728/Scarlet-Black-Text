Thorson»5mirl|'s slighrly unusual approach probably has somerhing
to do wirh her slighrly unusual background, which has included several
years orwark studying pornography and sexuality for the Presbyterian
Church. “Myacadcmicrnining rs somewhat diirerenr. I don'rhalv: a PhD.

She has also loved seeing the rcsulrs in the

much. The creuriviry and the imagination and

During her rime here, crrnnrll's srudenrs
