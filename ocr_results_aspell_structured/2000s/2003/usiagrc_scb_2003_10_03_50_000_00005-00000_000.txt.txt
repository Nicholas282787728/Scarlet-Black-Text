Striving for democracy Du Bois in 1905
over inequality

Du Bois, cont. from p. 1
From his analysis ortaciai discrimination.

Du Bois‘s concept of the “double conscious.
ness" has turned into a “Culture industry," said
Andrews. Scholars continue to mdcﬁn: this con-
cept which otiginnted rtom
the idea that heingoiack was
antithetical to being Ameri—
can, asentiment Du Bois et-
ptessed in 1903. Histori-
cally, Andrews explained,
“the lacs! ordomoctaey, the
idea that all men are created
equal, is handtinthand with
genocide of Native Ameriv
cans and enslavemcnr ofAf-
l’iCﬂnnAmcllCullS."

“How do we make [de-
mocmcy and divcisiry] Com-
patible?" asked Andrews.

Addressing these issues will be speakers {tom
iiniyetsitios around the country. as well is Gtinnell
college professots, alumni and cuttentstudcntsri.

Advanced Ptoiect (MAP). “The goal of my MAP
was to design a ooutse syllabus that invites the Grins
nell Philosophy Department and students to read
and teach philosophy in light of‘taee' and racism,"
she said.

The work or philosophets who will speak at
the symposium shaped the ditection ofHamen's
project. “My excitement is about the two philoso—
phy people who are coming. Lucius Outlaw and

“Its not like we can wear
these bands around our
wrists and ask ourselves
’What Would Du Bois Do?’
We have to ﬁgure these
things our for ourselves."

Emmanuel late ate both committed to doing phin
losophy and understanding that philosophy is done
in a taeisiizad world." Hansen said. “Not all phit
losophers are as attuned to racial thinking. outlaw
and hae are doing pretty mdieal sluffbecause not
enough people give the int
iiuenet or racial context
enough attention."

The title of the sympo-
sium was chosen specifically
to addtess the conttadietion
between democracy and in.
stitutionalited inequality.
“Diversiry is a fairly recent
term, out it seems to me that
long heiom they wete talks
ing about democracy they
wete talking about the prob
lem ofthe other,“ Andrews
said. “The ptoolem or the
othet has been with us since 1492."

The symposium dodn’t aim to search for the
answers to contemporary ptolslems in Du Bois’s
writings, out to generate discussion or how Du
Bois's ideas continue to impact conceptions oirace,
demoetscy and diyetsity

"it's not that we can weat these bands around
out wtists and ask ourselves ‘What Would Du Bois
Do." we have to ﬁgute theses things out for our
selves," Andrews said. “A lot orit is going to have
to be up to the audienoe. And I think that’s some
thing Du Bois would have been happy with,”

Excerpts from the 5&3

“While not depreciating [BooketTl Washington's plan
or the partial results attained [Du Bois] utges that this aim is
too narrow and can neyetsave the race. High education must
supplement rheTuskegee programme. The tace must have
leadats and they must be [mined in institutions of highet
learning. Washington's policy he thinks to he a positive evil
when it eomes to making the negro eharaetet submissive.
He tathet favors the progressive and aggressive spirit ror the
negto as the onlysolution [to] the race problem."

“instinct, [Du Bois] said, the arbiter ofanimals, out not
of men, had always prejudiced the white iace against the
black tace. The negro iace comptises one eighth otout popu.
lation. Atlanta university [where Du Bois was a professor]
was founded on faith in humanity inside as well as out it
is one of the few places where whites and blacks meet on an
equal fearing. It is one orthe rive negto schools that deserve
to he called colleges and its standard is equal to that ofany
new England school

“lryou systematically degtade a people rot years you have
no right to be sutptised at theit degtadation not run you
expect to undo it in a day. The negro race hm made greater
ptogtass than any other race in the same lengdr of time in
the wotlds history. There ate now more Ulitemte whites than
blade and the blacks oWn land equal in area to New [in-
gland."

“The seyetest indictment that can he brought against
the Ametican people is that they have failed to study and
sympathise with the negro and have yielded to racial and
social prejudice. Word-i should be recognized undet all dis.
guises. the nTgte problem is out a single phase or the world
problem: namely where shall the color line be drawn. The
white rates have no monopoly in civilization and may not
prevail.”

“The policy oftotce, {eat and oppression which has here.
[ofol’e been adopted towatd the negro should he ehangod to
one orldndness, sympathy and assistance."
