The Athletic CentEri designed by the famed
architectural companies Sasaki Associates and Cesa
Pelli at Associate, has been given good reviews by
various members of the Grinnell College athletic
community.

“The design is hincrional, exciting and imprcst

“It’s nice and wonderful," added Erin Hurley,
coach of the Grinnell College sivlmming and oliv-
lng teams.

Phase one or the Athletic center isn't cheap.
it's proicctsd to cost about $20 million. However,
the athletic campus community is also agreed on one aspect of the
center; they think the cost is irrelevant. All they (are about is the

“The locker rooms and slioweis in Darby, among other things,
are below standard," said men's basketball coach David Aiseneault.
“With the new Eicility, which is going to be incredible by the way,

our gymnasium will finally conform to the NCAA
speciﬁcations rot hosting national events. "

The Athletic center will be located north or

include morcspace, whether it's the ﬁtness/weight
center, which will he 8,000 square root, or the base

swimming pool

“The swim team," said Daniel Pcdcrson '04, “is in need or a
larger pool with more lanes to tiniii crricieiirly."

Coach Hurley concurred,

“The swimming pool in the mic is about 30 years old, well
beyond its lifespan," she said. ”it has oiitlitcd its usefulness. it is the
only indoor pool in Grinnell, and is small and is used by the Grinnell
High School swim tennis. Because of its small size, its dimcrilt for
criniiolls men and women swimming and diving teams to train all
at the same time."

Fortunately rot Hurley and the swim teams, a swimming pool
will be constructed in runiie phases orthc center.

tion will more than make up rot the sentimental value or Darby.

“The new resiliw will he classy and intimate. I’m sure my team
will absolutely love playing in it.” he said.
