Ifndmlnlsrrators and trustees were to
adopt a recent proposal by a pair or
Grinncll professors, tuition would be.

The proposal, laid out by Clark
Lindgren, Biology, and Mark Schneider.
Physics, was last discussed publicly in
February 2003 at an open forum for stra.
regic planning.

The Planning steering committee is
in charge orreviewing all ideas presented
for the strategic planning orrhe college.
Liridgreri and Schncldcr'x strategy pro.
poses implementing a zero—tuition policy
for the purpose orcrearing "a liberal arts
college ornational stature that is unique
in its ability to matriculate students re.
gardtess or their economic circum.
slanccs.”

Llndgmn and Schneider hope that
this strategy will encourage capable stu.
dents with less money for college to con.
sider Grinnell. According to Schneider,
many students in lowa and elsewhere
don’t consider Grinncll for the simple fact
that “its too expensive and it’s a 'rich kids
school."

“We're taking an institution till! nl»
ready produces a good product.” said
Lindgren, “and making it necessitate to
everyone"

Furthermore, implementing a zero-
tuition pohcy would be likely to increase
Grinnctl’s selectivity and its yields that is,
more students would apply to Grinnctl,
theoretically matting admission more
competitive.

irthe proposal didn’t work, and Liodgren
and Schneider are conﬁdent that it can.

Lingren said, “I wouldn’t market this
as an attempt to do something really dra.
matlc."

The proposal does not call ror stu.
dents to pay nothing They would still
hand over recs for room, board and sru.
dent activities. But instead of charging
ruinon forclasscs, the college would seek
aid from foundations and donations rrom
parents and alumni.

Lindgren and Schneider predict that
a college errering a oeronuition policy
would be attractive to many people and
corporations.

however, believe such amtiation would be
avoidable thanks to the large endowment,
the dramatic air orthe proposal and the
many ways in which money could be
raised.

dependent on any one donor."

agreements with
groups that did
not share the
college's goals.

Additionally,
Lindgren and
schneider noted
that several years
ago Grinnell held
a “capital campaign" which was to last 5
years with the goal of raising 15 million
dollars. The campaign was so successful
that the money was raised in a years.
Recently st. Olarran a similar campaign.
which brought in 150 million dollars in
