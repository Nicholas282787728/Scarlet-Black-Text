Apology for
inappropriateness

In the March issue of The GUM. an ariicle saying mean, inap-
propriare, and unrruc rhings abour Chad Maizen appeared. Al-
rhough Chad was aware or rhe general idea of ihe areiele. and was
aware ihar we would use his pierure, he did nor see rhe text ofthc
article unril after ir was published. alihough 1 said rhar he would.
The resulr was damaging ro Chad. The GUM, and ro rhe grearer
Grinnell communiry.

The appearance errhie arriele not only goes againsr GUM policy,
bur was also orherwise generally inappropriare behavior berween
people. I offer my slncerest apologies char rhis occurred. and. as
ediior orehe magazine, rake full responsibiliry for ihe misralee.

The GUM does not suppoir arracles on unknowing individu»
oh. and when meurioning indiyidnals, iries ro print only arrieles
ehai are direcrly approyed by rhose inyalyed, Even when individu-
als do appear in rhe Inaguzlnc, We cry to focus on rheii public life
insread ofrhcir priyare lire, in rhis ease, we should hare made fun
orchad being a chublicnn. nor Chad himself,

Although i ean’r undo rhe damage rhar has been done. l :lm
raking steps ro cusiiie rhar similar ineidenis will not rate place in
rhe fueure. In nine {or rhe next issue or The GUM, I am making
changes in The GUM policy in boner prnreee againsr undeserved
and unrrue personal arraeles.

After all, complain-

You shouldn’t have a car

There aren't any parking spaces on South Campus
Why do people have cars? Only I should have a can
Why do people park on East St? They should all park
on 10th St. or something It’s notjust that there are
no spaces close to my room, I’m one of those people
who wants to run into the people who sit around
waiting for good parking spaces at Wal—Mart. There
are NO SPACES AT ALL. I've disguised my car as a
”guest” by hiding the student tag; I’ve parked in the
faculty spaces and tried to move before I geta ticket.
On Sundays, Ican park on the street in order to be
near the church. So (1) there are clearly too many
faculty spaces, half should be made student/faculty
spaces, (2) everyone living in Loose and Read should
park in the Darby lot... even though it’s often full
too, and (3) I should give up driving and save the
environment“. or start parking on the French House

A sudden interest in loggia posters

I ﬁnd that my socialineptitude peaks during walks
up and down our loggiar Really, how do you deal with
that person just in front of you who isn’t walking fast
enough to keep well ahead, but is walking too fast
foryou to make a smooth pass. You have to assume a
weird stalker position of breathing over their shoul-
der until you can "accidentally" trip over a campus
bike and lie very still while allowing them to assume
appropriate distancei Not to mention the hon in-
evitability of eye contact with bad hook-ups, Duck-
ing out the nearest door is too obvious, and there is
the eternal fear of being labeled "immaturea" Pretty
much all you can do is feign incredible interest in the
latest Rasenﬁeld poster, and—face it—he knows
you’re faking,

Post oﬁice pathos

When i send a letter, I'm not allowed to simply
write two words on a piece of paper, slap some tape
on it, and drop it in the mail slot. That wouldn't be
write. Er, right. Ritual is involved. Postal pageantry.
Penmanship. Particular postmarks. Pinpointed
positions, Why, then, is the poor Grinnell college post
office slapped with such a sorry little sign for
identiﬁcation? "Post Ofﬁce" the paper sign says,
starkly and sadly, glaring through the door glass and
fading in the sunlight. To sir with no love at all it ,
seems: This does not get my stamp of approval. I‘d
like to see a sign more permanent. Smtely. Let’s lick
this problem and get someone to reroute the direction
the college is going in terms of valued projects. Yhe
Chrystal Center gets a sign, and the post office has
way more letters than 14.
