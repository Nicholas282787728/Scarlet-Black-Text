DCSPIK‘ some demands [lml the G UM‘s flllldr
ing for next year be revoked it does not nppear
that the amount ofmoncy allozntcd to 77/: GUM
will change due to the controversy over their most
recent edition.

The body responsible for this decision, and
for the allocation of funding to all student me.
dia groups is the student Publication and Rae
dio Committee (SPARC), although Student Ali
fairs does retain a seldom used veto power over
SPARC decisions. Though the committee has yet
to maltc a decision regrrding GUM funding,
Michael Andersen '03i one of three SPARC
members, speculated that the Comlnlﬂec would
be “very hesitant to outright eliminate a perma.
nent publication,"

“The GUM: satire provides a valuable, if
dangerous, service to the campus." Anderson
said. “Therefore, I tentatively plan to support
the publication of two GUM: next year.” Social
insensitivity seemed to be the largest issue or
hand, he added, but he believes that “the cur»
rent controversy will convince future GUMsuit»
ets to go over their articles with greater rigor.”

Because the funds in the publications bud-
get come from the student activity fee that stu—
dents pay as part of their tuition. many ofthose
who were offended by the content orthe mugs.
zinc suggested a chsnge in the way that campus
pulslirrtions are ﬁnanced.

Katya Gibel Azoulny, Anthropology, srgued
that “students should have the right to contrlbr
ute or not contribute to publications" as they
see fit. “It's being Imposed on them, 1nd that's
not right." she said. “And I would support those
students who requested a refund on that por.
tion of their financial contribution that went to

Things to Check Out in Town

A number oforrendod students wcrc shcpti.
cal ofthc (st/M‘s protested mouves for iiiclucl.
ing tho controversial content. “I thinls it was to
get pcnpic talking," siid lcla Garcia ’06. “not
necessarily to get people its open up, to con.
sciously reexamine then theories about race and
racial preludice. .lbuti to get people to read a
magarine, to cause a bit ofa sensation.“

And while Garcia hclievos thst there is some
value to being shocked into awareness, she said
that such highly controversial incidents. which
malte the small minority of multicultural stu
demo on campus real more marginalized and
more isolated, are notworth thegrowth that may
come from the racial discussion that ensues.

Giovanni cotter ‘04 agreed. “The idea or
ridiculing someone to accomplish something is
ridiculous, and [if this is the way growth is
achieved] people should be ashamed that they
recomplished sorncthiiig."Thc frustrating aspect
to the open rorum, she soid, was thst it was
“pretty clear" that the large crowd came to learn
about the scandal rather than tsliting openly
about race relations.

“it mites scandal ora derogatory nature in
public to bring people out," she said. “And that's
disgusting."

For now, at least. the uproar his dicd down.
