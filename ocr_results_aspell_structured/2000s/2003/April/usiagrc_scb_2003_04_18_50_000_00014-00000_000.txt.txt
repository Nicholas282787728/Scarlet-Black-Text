A sordid game

Dear Editor,

playingcards pdr) reveal an absolute lack ofrestraint on the part of
our military to inninr separation between what is functional and
what is egregious. 1 would not take issue with ccntial Command
issuing photographic identity cards to aid in the militarvs errort.
Howcvur, by assignin playing card symbols in this seemingly hclpe
rul tool the cards literally transform a legitimate military errort into
a game, something we all know this war is not. The playing cards are
symptomatic ora cavalier attitude that is all too present in tho way
we have handled this war. especially in regard to the international
community AreAmericansstill to believe that [heU.S armed tortes

Keep asking
questions

Effecting change isn't only a matter orgetting the iight answeis:
it's a matter ofasking the right questions.

A uteful reading ofyour article last week on crinntli's ongoing
custodial schedule shirt paino an accurate picture or the situation
from an admirable plurality orviewpoints ( FM continues earlier
scheduling for new custodral positions, April 11). its readers should
remember to keep asking questions.

Unfortunately, Facllitles Management administrators have cho-
sen to continue increasing the number ofcistodians who must at.
rive at work at four in the morning As [hc piece notes, however,
custodians are not simply being forced to move to the early shift:
only new hires, and current employees who ask to move to new 10:}
tions, are required to
changcshirrs This isguud.

One might queriion,
orcoursc, the extent to
which this policy gives out
todians a run range crops
(ions—when mostofthrm
were hircd they surely use
potted that they would be
allowed to request new
buildings without nccding
to rcddjustm much ortheir his. but I am gratcrul tor it all the same.

What 1 rear readers nryour article may toiget is the modesty of
this provision. No responsible employershould ciao force its workers
to move involuntaiiiy tn diamatically difrerent shifts. Thank good.
ntss Grinnell doesnt The initiative that students approved so over.
whelmingly last semesiei, however, Was not a mere request that the
college ask employees permission before moving them to the Curly
shirt. Rather. it argued the early shift actually undermines the quality
orlito at crinnell for employees and for students,

cusiodians hired to ﬁll the new shift will obviously be OK with
it, and orfering workers a variety ofdilrercntshifts is great. That's not
the problem. The PM decision moves custodians behind the scenes

The FM decision moves
custodians behind the
scenes and even further
from students’ lives.

and oven ﬁinher from students lives
Seeing the people who clean up after us, .md the people who we
clean up after, is good tor all ofus iii an honest and welhmeanrng
errort to improve custodial crricienty. FM administrators have failed
to take th is into account, and I fear that the school will stirrer further
for may dorm custodial position that moves to the earlier shirt
FM director Mark Godat said this spring that not all the dorm
custodial positions are expected to move. This, too, is an important
decision. and a wise one. But he has, as far as i know, railed to speciry
the number orciistodiins who will remain on the day shirt. Asking
FM to provide this informationiwl-ille doing our part to stay in
touch with ciotodians' own opinioan the most important thing
we students can do to maintain discourse over this important issue.

Is it a waste?

on Tuesday 1 had the privilege ofwitnessing the last ever Cowlcs
couscous sculpture by Matt Smith. it has been ivoiidertul to watch
the art of couscous evolve over the last rout years. Unfortunately,
several Gnnnellians were angered by Matt's blatant “waste or food."
one of them decided to get dining services stafr involved in rotting
Matt to give up his ﬁnal masterpiece. i watched in annoyance as that
same Giinnellian threw away part or ii chicken sandwich she had
been eating, i understand the liberal sentiment otnot wanting people
to waste food for one reason otanother, but us important to think or
this problem in more than just terms orshcrr volume. That tiny bit
ofchidtcn that was thrown away took more land use, human labor,
and fossil ﬁiel resources to
produce than did Matt’s last
five couscous creations
combined. That's die nature
ofeating meat produced in
a factory farm system.

lamavegan, butl don't
claim any kind otmoral su.
periority. I have a car. and
even though lam trying to
use it less, i am still just as culpable ofover. .consumption as everyone
else I Just ask that we not be hypocritical in what we demand ofour
fellow community members. The annual sporn team cereal—eating
contest wastes much more resources than an entire year‘s worth of
cousoous sculptures. Yet, both dining services and the student body
condoncs one event and condemns the other. Come on Ctlnncll,
let's get educated. would the sculpture be more acceptable if it were
done in wood.> Even ifthe wood took more rerouices to produce,) I
think couscous is an crricient and creative medium, This issue of
hypocritical consumption goes far beyond this petty lunchroom
drama And for the record, i am a big tan orboth the ceredlacating
contest and the couscous art.

Ijust ask that we not be
hypocritical in what we
demand of our fellow
community members.
