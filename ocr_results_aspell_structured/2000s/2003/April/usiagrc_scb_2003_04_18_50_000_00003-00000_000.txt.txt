vember rather than April. At the time. organizers were
unsure whether they would reprise the events in the spring.
This semester, FAC meinhers seemed to have deeided it
wasn't worth it, said Danyell Robinson '03.

But Robinson. who runs the SexualAssaultWorking
Group (SAWG), a past collaboratorwrth FAC in organiz—
ing the weelo decided to hold the events anyway,

“Take Baek the Night is a very traditional, ritualistic
event," she said “it just seemed inappropriate to let April
pass and not do the rally."

Next weeks events, Robinson said, will focus on the
history errake Back the Night at Crinneli. With that goal,
SAWC invited two past speakers to Thursdays rally, the
Centerpiece of the week vietoria Brown, History, Sylvia
Thormn-Smith, Religious studiesand sociology, and Vice
President for Diversity Fianleionias '72 will speakahout
the event’s importance and its past.

As usual, the rally will also indude testimonies from
victims and survivors and will he tollowed by a march
around ampus and a “speakeut” at the Gtinnell Com-
munity Center.
