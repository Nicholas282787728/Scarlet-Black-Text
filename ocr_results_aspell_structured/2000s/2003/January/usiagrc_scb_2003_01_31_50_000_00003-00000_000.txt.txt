The first time Eliubeth Pckarek ’05 removed
harl’smtd from her wallet this semester, 2 small piece
of pspor fluttercd to the floor. Written on thc tome
ofrcomcr ofa page wcro rho words, “I love you.
Love, Amy}Y When Pckzrek had left her wallet in Quad
last semester, her friend Amy Wilson ’05 had stuck the
note into Pekzreks wallet while Wilson was working the
breakfast shift,
Pekatek had read the note many times before, but the
first time she saw it afterwinler break brought tears to her eyes
instead of maki ng her laugh or smile.

She had learned only a few days before that Wilson had corn»
mirtcd surcidc on Monday, lsnuary la in her home in University
City, Mo, Pekalek got a call from San Scannell ’05, and when her
mothetdeliveted the message to her, Pekatek said, “Oh, she's prob
ably at Amy's giggling about something and they decided to call
me." She had no idea that Sannell would give her such shattering
news.

The note became a pcrmaucnt ﬁxture of Pekarek’s wallcr the
day Wilson slrppcd it in. “l-:vcn boforc wc lost her," Pcloarck said at
\Vilson’s memorial service on Thursday, Jan. 23, “that note brought
great joy to me every rim: 1 redlsmvered it among rhc junk in my

wallet.”

Loving to give

Wilson's friends remember her as always
making others feel loved. They said her de»
site to give seemed to flow namrdly from
her, as if she didn't even have to think about

always rcmembcr Wilson as a vibrant porson who loved to have
run. Those Wilson lived with will ospccislly treasure pictures of
Amy laughing in their memorics.

“We're rho biggest dorks," said Wells, “We have so much fun,
and we laugh all the time... Wc used to hsvc dinosaur time; Lisa,
Amy, and I wore studying onc day and we just decided that we
really nsedcd to bo dinosaurs. "

Wells laughed and Stevens chimed in. “ch walk around,
shouting out whith dinosrur we were."

“She was rhc best veloctraptor,” Wells said.

Infusion of art

in addrriou to a fabulous fricnd and dinosaur, Wilson was r
committed studcnr. “Amy really carcd about all ofher work being
the best that it could be," Stevens said. She pulled lots of allsnightets
working ihtcnscly on rcscarch papcrs or artwork, but she made up
forit during rhc day byspcnding lots oftimc wearing comfy clothes
and taking naps.

“I have this imagc ofAl-ny walking down the hall in these baggy
bluo sweat pants and a non-descrlpt shirt," scannsll said.

“Thc pants were always dragging on the ﬂoor," stsvcns said,
“so they made more noise."

“1 )LEE rememberhet walk," Smnell said, “She sort-of shuffled.”

Bracken King, Wilson‘s boyfriend whom she had bccn dating
sincc high school, spoke aboutAmy’s artistic pcrsonaliry at her me-

—— modal service lastweek.
"Being friends with Amy
was like spinning with
our hands together, so

“lost as Amy infused her art into every-
ming, shc saw it in many places that we
might easily pass over," he said. “Thosc who

They now undcrstand that Wilson was
dcprcsscd, but shc didn’t sharc dctails about
hot depression with her fricnds. She wasn’t

Little gifts like the note in Pekarek'swal-

and She showed hot appreciation for rhcm with genuine
gcsturcs. “Amy gsvo herself to [her friends] in so many
ways," said Lisa Stevens '05 st rho memorial service, “swcct

understanding, and rims."
Art was very important to Wilson; she was a talented
artist and planned to major in arrhistory. stcvcns noticed
a parallel between botherson’s art and her rclarionships.
“Amy took time and care with her strwork and she took
time and (are for hcr friends.”
Many of the stones Wilson’s fricnds tdl portnry hot
spontancrty and small size (5'2"). “Smallness was a
big part ofAr-ny's life," said Linda Wells ’05, “She even

Her friends said that sometimes Wilson's sense of
humor was cute, sometimes quirky, and sometime: rust
a bit rnnppropnaro or unexpected, Regardless of the tonc
of her yokcs and pranks, Wilson was alwuys malong othcrs

their behalf
“When Amy first met Matt Ewing {“02} in Fme rho Plancr,

sit in the back of the van next to her," said stovons '05. “Matt

“She just thought it was hilarious," Wells said,

“And shc didn't bother to tell him later mar she was ,oking

Wclls bclicvo that it was Wilsons amaze
ing talent for tiny dcrarls that caused her to
neglect things like cleanliness. She would
focus on a pioco ofarr, a paper, or a gift for
somconc for hours until it was just the way
she wanted it.

Becca Merrill '05, a floormatc of
Wilson’s on Read 3rd, ramombcrs Wilson’s grh of precision from
an art class they shared last ycsr. “She would remember seemingly
insignrfroant things—details tharl had forgotrcn rharl had men»
rioncd a week bcforc when we were talking in class."

Wilson’s fricnds found that the consciousness with which she
nested her friends’ lwcs was unique, and for it she will be rcmcm.
bated. “Amy paid attention to derail when it came to her friends,"
Wells said. “Amy listened, and Amy remembered. There wss als
ways rhc perfect card on your birthday, which Amy picked out
herselfand then had cvcryonc else sign.“

Coming to terms

Wilson's love for her fricnds was rcciprocrrcd, which Pekzrek
bchcvcs has a lot to do with why erson did not talk to her friends
about hcr dcprcssion, “I think that she lovod her fricnds so much
thsr shc didn't want to worry or hurt us."

Many studcnts have been trying to reconcile the funny storrcs
and images ofWilsou as happy with tho fact that she commitrcd
suicide. Somc are shocked, others scared, and many porplcxcd. Emily

Wilson’s friends arc sure that regardlcss ofWilson's rcason for
commitriugsuicidc, rhc vibrant personality thatshc exhibited was
not a facade. The love shc showed for her friends was consistent
and was resl.

“lacing friends with Amy was like Spinning, with our hands
