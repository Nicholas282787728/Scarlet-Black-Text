Capturing Brazil

Faulconer Gallery exhibit illustrates the urban Brazilian experience

by Amanda Davis
Staff Writer

Towers ofvibtantly colored and transparent shapes emerge
from the ﬂoor like huge columns of rock candy Cutving
wooden sculptures vaguely resembling furniture cateenat une
expected angles. A skateboard bears dozens of tiny human
and animal figures, as ifenacting a skater version ofthc Noah's
ark story.

in past weeks, these curiosities have been visible through
the windows of the Faulconer Gallery. Of course, they are .
more than simple curiosities. The: and other works of art
will be showcased in the new exhibition opening tonight,
Layers oiBra-iilian Art,

The show, curated by Faulconer Gallery Director Lesley
Wright, includes over 60 pieces by 24 artists whose work
encompasses four dccades ofBrazlle
ian art, According to Wright, a
category as broad as “Brazilian
art" encompasses more than just
a geographical area.

“Given that were living in a
global world. a lot of the artists
are very sophisticatcd and know a
great deal about international art. It’s
not like they‘re just living in Brazil
and not aware ofwhat's hap-
pening in the

installation in progress for

world,” Wright said. “One oi the big puzzles for me was
how do I ﬁnd an that's ‘Brazilianil So i ended up just look-
ing for the best art that they're showing in Brazil by Brazil-
ian artists, not neeessatily picking art that looked
quintessentially Brazilian, because how would you do that
anymore?"

The decision to focus on Brazilian art was inﬂuenced by
Grinnell alumnus and trustee Gregg Narber 'os, Narber, who
is on the Board orTrustees‘ Fine Arts Committee, studied as
an exchange student in Rio de Janeiio and subsequently lived
and worked in Sao Paulo.

As the title or the exhibition implies, the pieces them.
selvcs entail many layers or meaning. Wright pointed out
several pieces that are physically composed of layers such as
the rock candy-like sculptures, sculptures actually made are
conglomeration or transparent objects. They are tailed

When selecting pieees for thc exhibit, one at the

Brazailian aspects that Wright sought to capture was the

country's urban energy “I wanted to really announce From

“This is about city Brazll.”

Dancing for social justice

by Katie Mears
Editor—in-Chief

When Jill Peterson ’03 and Barbi
Rodriguez ’025 joined dance troupeas ﬁrst»
years, they began a conversation and have
sustained it ever since. Theyve been ialk.
ing about dance and its potential role in
furthering social justice movements. And
now, three years later, theirmnvcrsation will
take form.

They don’t know FJKICdy what it will
look like or where It will take place, but
what they do know is what it will be about:
the antlrwai effort.

They considered other topicsiihe en»
vironment, death penalty, dass ianLIZ-lity‘
but they kept returning to and war eiioits. .

“its the immediaey orit all,” Peterson
said, “Everything else we threw around
seemed not as urgent. [The war] is what
peopleaietalltingaboutandthinkingabout
and what needs to be commented about."

Peterson is taking an independent study
entitled “Protest Dance/Theater" with
Chris Connolly that will culminate in the

dance “The goal," she said, “is to look at
how art, theater and dance can work to-
gather to create images that directly impaet
or inspire as a form orprotest."

Auditions will be
held this Sunday and
the pair knows exs
actly who they want
in the piece.

"Everyone,"
Rodriguez said,
Peterson agreed.

“We want people
against the war,"
Peterson said,

“People
colds."

“People not
afraid of contro-
versy."

“People not afraid otbeing outrageous.”

They say that auditions will be very laid
back with a litde bit ormoving and a hide
bit oispcaking and a little bit oihlling out

“dried out."

She said that she
sees this project as an

staging a dance, you
have an amazing
amount of power to
make that time [in the theater] [award the
audiences social consciousness," the said.
“You have this stage and you get to put on
whatever you want."

Rodriguez was never as involved with

activist causes as Peterson, but she says she’s
very interested in how dance _c:m be used
to aireet the audience. “With dance troupe.
you don't leave people feeling all that difa
retenr item when they tame in," Rodriguez
said. Shes excited about the opportunity
to infuse dance with political messages.

Whatever the exact form, Rodriguez
and Peterson agree that the audience will
play a crucial part. Peterson said that ihe
audiences participation might be such that
attendees don't even realize diey'te involved
“The audience can be used u a prop," she
said, “where you’re sitting and otactly how
close." ’

Rodriguez and Peterson are not yet sure

Whether it’s an actual stage or some.
