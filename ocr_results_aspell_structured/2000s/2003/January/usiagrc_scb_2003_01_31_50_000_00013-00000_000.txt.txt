he’s kind or had to he adjustable to my
schedul:, [but] he’s really understanding
when I have work to do."

Robb’s youth also gives some people
douhrs. She and Dolph gor married beams:
“there was no doubt in my mind lhat he
was the person I wanted to be with," she
said. “We just saw no reason to wait... I
felt comfortable when l was young."

Ovemll. Heather knows she is an ex
oeprion rather than 1 wk. “I‘m not saying
cvcryone should b: like me. but I like it.”
she smiled, “and so does my husband."
