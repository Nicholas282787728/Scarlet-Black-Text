Sketchiness abroad: adventures in the Middle East

Cairo, Egypt. Oct. 2007. 1 was in midst of my
Grinnell-in-London semester, and rather than spend
fall break rouiing Europe like all or my peers, 1 de»
cldcd to be adventurous, and go to Egyp .

I stayed in an apartment with my fiiend Zach,
a classmate from high school, who was studying in
Cairo. A tall, lanky guy, Zach has a geeky yer friendly
persona,not at all conducive to (1K: tough, tcrsc dimer
sphere of Cairo,

on my first day there, we did what every rein»
ist ti ies to do—we saw the famous Giza Pyramids.
We walked to Caito’s main plaza,Tahteer Square, an
iconic panorama snrionnded by the lzgyptian Mu-
seum. the Nile River, and the Arab League. There,
we found a trwi,which would take us to the pyramids,
about an hour away.

Everything seemed fine at ﬁrst, We sat in the
backseat of the cal), and made conversation with
our driver through the rear view mirror. He asked
us where we were from, and when he told him, he
exclaimed, “American touristsl 1 love them. Very
friendly.”

We soon encountered a bad trafﬁc jam, typical in
a Cairo afternoon. Our taxi re
mained stationary for a few min
utes, when all ofa sudden, a fans
dotn man walked from the side
or the road and up to our ttlxi.

He opened the front door on the
passengel‘s side and got into the
shotgun seat.

The driver smiled widely. “Said!" He said to the
man. The man shook hands with the driver and spoke
with him in Arabic for several minutes.

Perhaps this was ordinary. Egypt was a crowded
place, and it seemed reasonable that taxis may, on

Economic crisis

During the past several months. Crinnell Colr
loge has—dike so many other institutionsiwatched
hopelessly as years of accumulated wealth quickly
eroded in the ever-expanding ﬁnancial crisi . Last
Friday, College President Russel K. Osgood intormed
the Grinnell College community that the endowment
dropped somewhere in the range onS percent during
this fiscal year; meaning that since July 1, 2008 our
college has lost approximately $300 million.

The endowment may continue to decline. and pets
haps linger at even lower levels for the next few years.
Exactly how low or {or how long remains unknown.
Yet, as indicated in Osgood's response, Grinnell will
continue to uphold its cornerstone values: provid
ing an education to all students who show talent and
promise, regardless of economic need, and investing
in our faculty and staff.

Given this situation, however, signiﬁcant ques-
tions emerge as to how the College will proceed with
some ofits more ambitious goals. Although Grinnell
will need to make difﬁcult decisions concerning extra
capital expenditures, the wind turbine project should
continue along the same trajectory and not be do
ferred or compromised in anyway.

In Oct. 2007, the College issued an Emissions
Reduction Commitment which, among other items,
stated our dedication to the construction of wind nir-
bines and a water boiler in order to replace approxi-
mately 30 percent of campus electricity consumption

occasion, pick up strangers who were headed in the
same dilection. Itwas mere custoni,we ﬁgured, noth»
ing to be pettuibcd about. The new passenger, Said,
turned around and looked at us. He told us he was a
police ofﬁcer.

We soon cxitcd, and drove several miles on see
ondary roads through the desscrt, before a W in
a small village, The pyramids were nowhere in sight,
We all got out otthe cab, and, of coarse, Zach and i
paid the dliver, and not Said.

The policeman, Said, then told us that he was a
government ofﬁcial, and that the only way to see the
pyramids was if we went with him, At this point,
Zach and 1 were both quite confused, but given that
we were in middle ofilowhere in the Sahara Dessert,
we didn’t have a lot otoptions,

We followed him into his "office," a hut iii the vil-
lage. He asked for payment up front, so we gave him
the equivalent of about 10 us. dollars.

In his broken English, he asked us to follow him,
and once again, given the circumstance, we sues
cutnbcd. we walked through the village to an area
cornered on by barbed wire, where several camels

roamed the grass, Said, who
at this point was in ertect our
guide, told us that he was also
a professional camel renter,
and that riding atop a camel
was also a requisite for visiting
the pyramids.

Suddenly, the famous Giza pyramids weren't all
that appealing. Said was standing about 15 her away
from us,whcn I whispered into Zach's car,“7.ach,1'm
not sure this a good idea. I don't think I can do this.
I niean,1’ve never ridden a camel before."

Very friendly. "

He took us into the camel farm, picked out two
sandy looking animals, and somehow made them sir,
I sat in between the two humps of my camel, and,
in an almost rhythmic fashion, it mechanically rose.
There 1 was, with my cameia bag around my shoulder
and my passport in my back pocket, mounted atop a

As we rode, Said incieascd the price, threaten-
ing to not to take us all the way irws didn’t pay him.
Zach ai-gmed with Said

“No, no, too much money. You said b0 pounds.
150 is too much."

“No, no,” he would shout back, “it is good price. I
don’t cheat you"

“I understand that, but...”

seem bleak now, the economy and out endowment
will in time recover.

Yet, we must also remember that the pace of dis
mate change will not wait for this eventual economic
recovery. The future or our global environment only
becomes bleaket the longer we delay making signiﬁ-
cant changes in the way we produce and consume en-
ergy. Time horizons are limited.
Even in economic downturns.
the College should uphold its
environmental commitment to
reduce carbon emissions. Alt
though the decision to allocate

ra expenditures may seem
imprudent, Osgood i dicates that the endowment
remains in a better position compared to many peer
instinitioiis. We possess a unique ability to continue
development of our environmental initiatives.

A president at one of our peer institutions, Color
tado College, recently stated in the New York Times
that, “Several years ago. we started thinking about
sustainability in environmental terms.

“Now we need to be thinking about sustainability
in economic tertns."0ut institution, however, should
become an environmental leader, prioritizing renew-
able energy despite the economic collapse because it’s
the right thing to do not only for the future of our
college but also for the {units of our global environ
ment.
