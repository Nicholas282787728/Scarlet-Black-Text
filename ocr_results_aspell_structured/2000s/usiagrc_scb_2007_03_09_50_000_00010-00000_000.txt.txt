Rosa Parks: An example for everyone to follow

Political activism and civic crigrrgcmcnt, tar from
being a path tor some, is a calling to all. Rosa Lou-
ise Parks, mother of the lvlontgomcry bus boycott
and by extension the us. civil rights movement, is a
particularly lovely illustration of tlirs mllel‘n. Born to
a small tanning tamily in rural Alabama, lV Parks
experienced racial discrimination from her earliest
childhood, As an adult,
she work as a tailor and
served as secretary of the
NAACP. What we re-
nieinhei' Rosa Parks for
is one act of deﬁancc that
set an entire movement
into motion, When asked
to give up her seat to a
white man, she quietly but tirmly refused. She was
arrested undchirn crowscgrcgation laws and the rest
we know to be history

Rosa Parks was not alone in challenging thc sysr
rem that made some citizens secondtclass. The same
year that she refused to give rip her seat, three women
had been arrested for having done the same. Maybe
hearing about them, Ms. Parks realised that refusal
was indeed an option, Maybe rhcse women made it
possible {or her to do what she did, and in doing so,
to capture the imagination of an entire community.
and then ofa nation. When Ms Parks claimed her
right to sit down, she found herscltsupportcd by oth-
ers who organised and took parr in a bus boycott that
lasted for more than a year and ended only with com

plete desegregation of buses. These otheis include
ED. Nixon, Jo Ann Robinson, Martin Luthcr King
Jr, and each black person who, when called upon to do
so, refused to get on any bus in town, Ms Parks could
not have carried the cause alone, and she was neit
thei the first iioi the ast to refuse to submit to those
rules which determined who could sit and who had
to stand on the basis of
racc. But not being tlic
ﬁrst one to challenge tlrc
system did not make her
role any less important.
She was an inspiration at
a time when inspiration
was badly needed.

thn Rosa Parks lC’
fused to relinquish her seat, she committed an act of
civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is a method by
which citizens tell the state that they will no longer
invest in following tlic rules and system set down by
the state, It is to take issue with the status quo, with rr
speciﬁc matter or just with how things are done, Acts
of civil disobedience take many forms, cacli suited to
a particular set of circumstances. Sometimes one has
to stand up and sometimes one needs to sit down.
Sometimes one must do something more, sometimes
the very act ofsayiiig "No" might be what is needed
Sometimes individual action proves most ett‘cctive.
oftentimes conceited group action is needed.

Civil disobedience can effect change on many
diirerent levels. For instance, engaging in a public

demonstration reminds others that public spaces are
there to be used, Coming from a country where any
gathering otrnnrc than thrcc persons in a public space
requires a poliec permit by law, i understand how imp
portant it is to use our public spaces. We havc cvcry
right to stand on the streets and make our concerns
known until someone takes heed. When law enfoicv
incnt tclls us that we have no business holding signs
and banging and clinging away in public spaces, they
tell us that we are private individuals who should re
turn to our private homes to privately ruminatc over
our private pioblems.When we begin to believe them
and refrain flom using our public spaces, we soon find
that there are no longer public spaces for us to use.

Whatever the form andwhatcver the cause, to en-
gage i civil disobedience one nccds three qualities:
creativity, commitment and common scnsc,Therc are
many ways of actually putting a wrench in the system.
Staple your tav returns in 30 dlffcr’ places to protest

possible onto trays and put them in the wash dispens-

o protest tuition hikcs. Refuse to touch any food or
drink or Ttsllirt produced in exploitative conditions
(go naked and hungry if necessary). sustain this not
tion until the authorities take no These actions miiy
be deemed wasteful and destructive, but they may also
be effective and essential. Above all, try to think out-
side the box. And remember that, like Rosa Parks,you
can always count on being part ofa movement already
in place, a movementjust waiting for you.

Institutionalizing the fundamentals of liberal arts

As another lnidtscms wcck ap-
proaches, many of us may ﬁnd our
selves asking that evertpresent ques-
tion: What is this all for? We slave all
day and all night on papers and tests,
on lab reports and problcrri sets, and
at the end of the day (or wcck) when
those grades come back, we may rind
that it really isn’t worth it.

Arter our last mid-scm, many etus
will choose not to go homc and (Clax
over Spring Break, but to instead par
ticipate in one of the many Alternative
Break trips or do various activities to
give back to the communities we have
come from. By usingtwhat we have
learned this half of the semester to give
back, ‘it becomes worth it.

doing homework is important, it's only
half the equation of our education. We

have learned along-

not subordinate to it.

things the adminis

of programs
are commonly
called “scr»

Most of our
peer instrtirt
tioirs that have
breaks similar
to ours in length offer their students a
J—term. During these
projects, students do
some work for cvalw
ation. such as writing
a journal or ﬁnal pat

energy is on the ac-
tual project.

The administrat
tion could take other actions to H160?
porate service learning that would only
be an extension otwhat already occurs
at the collcgc. An Alt Break trip could
be incorporated into a class,whcrc SIU’
dents apply what they have learned,
and see if their coursework actually has

to students, In addition to these credit
options, the CDO provides volumes of
resources for students, but most don’t
have trmc to do everything the CDC
offers, If the administration would pro-

a much easier time learning in the real

the \mlue of knole

many opportunities to learn, but they
must be marched with application.
Only then will students fulﬁll the our

prepared to “serve the common good."
