What would you do with $10 in Grinnell? The S&B sent
three teams out on the town with $10 each to see what
sort of (cheap) amusement they could ﬁnd. Some hit
up garage sales and thrift stores, some fed students ice
cream and others made their own horror movie in the

halls of Bucksbaum.

An early-morning ice cream study break

BY BRENDAN MACKIE

Grinnell's borrng, okay? Let's- just admrt
that right now, I'm not going to mm a blind
eye to the utter lack of anything to do in this
sleepy ton n.

So why did I accept an offer to tn to find
fun here with Ol‘rl) $10? I have no idea. Bill I
found myselfstutk with $10 in my pocket and
an obligation to try to find some meritronablc
amusement, For you.

I racked my brain all week trying to think
up of something cool that might impress you,
But my mind was a sullen
blank.

I struggled, setting my
imagination to the problem
whenever I drdn't have any
work. Which, this being our
over-applied school, was
rarely. constantly I was has
rassed by the question: what
can I do?

There are no roller-coasters in Grinnell.
No hidden rock concerts round the corner
from the corn field. A $10 bill will not, if aC’
companied by the requisite arcane signs, de»
liver you any sort of fun, no matter how hard
you try,

The most exciting thing you'll get if you
Google l‘Grinnell fun ten dollars" is an article
on quilting. I'm serious. Check it out yourself
if you dorit believe me. I was hoping some:
thing like bungee jumping.

The only thing I know about Grinnell is
the campus. And it’s filled with studious, over-
worked people like myself How can I delight
in it.> The days went by. 1 had no clue what

llnall}, since I could not think ofnnvthing
to do for myself, I thought that I would share
tllc bounty the la gave me with my colleges
So I went down to Fareway and bought myseli‘
one ofrhosc Cut-price, nenrly-tiue- -lircr rubs of
Neapolitan ice cream, some chocolate syrup,
some paper bowls and some plasnt spoons.

As Evan I’etric ‘07 and I entered ARI’I,
we saw heaps of studious peoplc ro ietd. We
approached someone who was pouring ov a
demonic textbook in one of the wcird study

alcoves. “Do you like ice
cteani?"I asked her.

She broke her nlinrstra~
tions and looked incr'cdur
lously at the pregirant bags I
lugged around, “Ice cream?"
she asked. I nodded. “But
it's 9:30 in the morning ..,"

. she protested.

We were nonpluscd.
We argued that it ms brain food—the sugar
and far would prove good fuel for the engaged
mind. (At Grinnell, one must furnish produc-
tive reasons for people to eat ice cream.)

And she ate. We then continued on our
mission. We went to the post ofﬁce where we
fed postal employees. We went to the Forum
where, surprisingly, we could only frnd one or
two hungry people. (I blame the new architec-
ture.)

We even went to the library, where we
managed to feed a couple of people, but were
in general stymied by the rule that you can’t
have food in the library. Especially sticky,
melty food,1 suppose.

It was a beautiful day. one of those idly
warm days that remind me in their peace and
succor that it is autumn, not summer, and
that soon the trees will be bare, and that snow
will blanket our campus. I have experienced
too few of these days, as, like the majority of
people we talked to, I have been scaled inside
being productive.

I had soon dispensed with most of my tub
and was about to give away my last bowl. It
had just gone 10 am. and people were swarms

A wonderﬁll confusion of Grinnell students.
I stopped someone who looked particularly
busy.

"Do you want any ice cream?"I asked.

He was conﬁrsed, then brightened. “That’s
the best question anyone’s asked me all day." he
said. I gave him a bowl.

“What can we do with 310 that’s legal?”A question that
I'm sure burns in the mind ofevery poor college student But
this time, it was an assignment, and it couldni be stupid, well,
as stupid as college students can usually be.

My friends and 1 toyed with a couple ideas at first. Would
we manipulate people into amusing? Would we give people s2
and see who could buy the object that would
get the highest splatter radius?

The answer to both of these was no. We
were too lazy to organize the ﬁrst and rhe
second could result in much more than $10
in fines. We needed to know what we could
do that would require very little effort and no
potential extra expenses, because as everyone
knows, effort and losing money are not fun.

After much deliberation, some might say procrastination,
we decided to make a movie with a $10 budget.Wc could check
a camera out from the AV Center and borrow props from peas
ple on our ﬂoor. All we needed to buy were the tapes. We even
managed to ger a digital camera from the lab so we could edit
our film on my computer,

We went searching for ideas last Saturday, and then I saw
it: my roommate’s rubber duck collection, and in it, the demon
duck. We now had all the ingredients for an excellent BrMow
le,

dialogue.

We went of to Wal-Mart and found them for 86 a piece,
leaving 54 for props at Goodwill (in case you aren't lucky enough
to have a bunch ofwerrrl stuff lying around your room).

When making your
movie, just fill your
head with bad hor-
ror cliches and corny

And think: one tape is 60 minutes ofraw footage, which is
easily an hour and a half long Brmovie, even ifyou do a silly
thing like use dialogue. We only filmed about 15 minutes of
footage and our movie is halfan hour long. Remember, budget
isn't bad. Nor, apparently, is lack of quality—think how much
money the Blair Witt}; Pny'en‘ made.

With a plor and props, all you need is a place. 1 ask you,
what is better for a Brmovie than overdone
scenes ofsomeone walking or running down
long empty hallways? And what is berrcr for
that then our very own Bucksbaum Center
for the Arts?

Ifyou haven’t been in the basement, you
should check it otit.Thcn picture lame horr
ror movie characters runnrng through it. it’s
quite entertaining, especially ifa bad mix of
orchestral music is being practiced in the background.

When making your movie, just ﬁll your head with had her»
tor cliches and corny dialogue. You can write a script in 10 milk
utes or work without one like we did.

Filming the whole thing only takes about two hours, plus a
Little time to edit in looped scenes and make bad sound effects.
You can easily finish before the other weekend recreational M,
tivitics start.

The confused looks on peoples faces when they see you
runningfronr your friend holding a camera and a duck through
the narrow hails ofBucksbaums basement are a huge plus too.

With a promo like this, who could help but want to make
their own horror movie?
