Distance makes the heart grow fonder

Rachel Fields l09 explores the many campus edifices: dining hall is up first

When I was in London, surrounded by museums and palac-
es and Cadbury‘s chocolate, my roommate and I would some-
times talk about the dining hall.

“Remember the nacl-io bar?" he'd say, and we'd both swoon.
“Remember tho sweet taste of oreo pie? Hey, ryas that the
(greens Parade that just passed our
window? Oh man, I would kill for
some beefolé right now"

You don't know what you've got
‘til it’s gonc, quoth Jesus or Joni
Mitchell. 1 don't think Joni cited
dining services as an example, so
I'm going to do it for her: you never
fully appreciate the dining hall un-
til you start weeping into your 238th can ofbaked beans. When
I read the 38E online and saw random hints about the food at
Grinnell, I was filled with an almost murdeious rage, Damn
kids don’t appreciate what they‘ve got," I'd rare to my flatmates.
“Why, when l was at thnnell, we ate tccn
burrer bars .1 clay and we tlrrln't men complain
when we had to go to the hosprtal later."

Im not sure when I actually became my far
rher, but rlns was a serious problem. If yoil re rn
England with American money, you basically
have to put a down payment on a candy bar. I
hope all the beer I drank there was laced with
platinum, because if nor,l thinki might have
wasted my money. When I realized thar England has no equiw
alent of Booties Farm 1 almost cried. And not even because of
what that says about my life.

To be fair, now that Im back' in Grinncll, things are difr
ferent. In my frrst few days on campus, 1 skulked around the
dining ball just looking at the food, thinking about the cans of
“erght hot dogs in brine”1 ate abroad and cackling to myself.
Now I've been back for a few weeks, and it's getting a little

yotr remember how hilarious and wonderful they were, and you

have so much hot, deliciously inventive food at our disposal.

and those they are seeking to persuade.

Up for action: SAs in SGA? Students and platforms?

Excluded from governing

This semester, as always, SGA sent outlet—
ters to those students most qualrfrcd to be sen—
ators, asking them to
consider running for
office. Yet one large
group or students is
not eligible for an ins
vitation—studcnt ad-
VlSOI'S (8A5) are not
allowed to run or par-
ticipate in SGA.

There are close to
75 SAs, students who work without any com-
pensation to help other people on their haLI.
While we prohibit these presumably good carr-
didates from running for office, SGA seems
to have trouble consistently attracting other
candidates. Even with solicitations from SGA,
and sometimes directly from Cabinet meme
bcrs, only two people chose to run this semesr
tcr n1 Jamaland. Joint Board excludes 1 group
that might eagerly participate ifallowed,

Some argue that SAs should not run be
cause it would put too much power in too
few hands. But this argument operates on

Staff Editorial ‘

a false dichotomy that the only nvo power
ful groups on campus are the 5A5 and SGA.
While this may be true in the administration‘s
cycs, groups like Free the Planet and Stoneco
both exert inﬂuence and power over popular

opinion th thc leaders
ofbotlr groups are SAs
similarly rho 551’ staff
is welcome to run for
SGA—and we like to
think we are a srgnrfr-
cant part orcampus life
and culture.

Furtheimorc, SA:
are allowed to sit on SGA committees, where
they can exert enormous inﬂuence on where
money is spent or how student/administration
relations progress.

Clearly, some SAs can handle major come
mirmcnts to committccs or student groups7
which weakens the argument that SAs cannot
handle two major campus roles at once. Jornt
Board is often the same amount of work as
leading a group, or editing the newspaper.

Power will always be located in the hands
of the involvedithe people who will pick up
the applications and find the time to follow up.

Whenever a significant group ofpeople is sper
cifically bailed from another student organizar
tien, the policy should be frequently ievisited
and discussed. The exclusion of SA: deserves
to be ieconsideied this emester, ideally before
another election takes place.

Harris policies shortrsighted

In November, the SEE ran a story about the
risks of students putting up and taking down
Harris party platforms At the rirrrc, students
questioned whether rlrc isr
sue was being appropriatclv
addressed by the adnrur -
[l'ﬂthILJlillil Bottles '08 was
injured by rhe platforms in
February 2006. And last
weekend, john Burrows ’10
was injured.

So why was nothing
done to remedy the situar
tion?

As the administration explains itr parry

category includes setting rrp platforms with
the assistance of trained Harris staff, In the
November article. Senior Associate Dean for
Student Life Michael Sims also noted thrltr
because of limited funds for student employ
ment, few Harris staff are available to help
party organizers.

But these arguments overlook the pos-
sibtlities for damage inherent when you mix
young people who may or may not know wh1t
they are doing and in go pieces ofheavy eutrrpr
inent.

RegardICSs of cost and convenience, a

deal with platform cane
struction and removal.
This price may seem high
at the moment, but the
administration should
think again.

Compare the cost of

further injuries.
