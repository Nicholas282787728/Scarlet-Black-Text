Jim Kropa in the April 23, 1993 issue of the
558. There is a spotty history behind this
time—honoied Grinnell custom where students
come together and, fueled by
a vast supply ol‘ beer, try to
best each other in it series of
challenging fears.

The Relays were first or
gmuzcd in 1973 and contlnv
tied on in their drunken glory
nnril 1987, when the drinking ztgc in Iowa was
raised from 18 to 21. Presumably, tit that time
the pangs ofalcohol withdrawal lert rhe sens
dents uninotivnted to perform the physical we
crtions necessary for the competition. By 1993,
though, students and faculty were ready to try
again:

Everybody poops

Normally, pooping poses no problem to me.

*Exccpt, of course, in the JRC. I seek an empty

stall, slide down- my britches, and proceed to
poop. When 1m ﬁnished, I deftly move in with
some T.P. and begin tidying up. Unfortunately,

-my porcelin throne often takes this opportunity

to conduct a ptccmptivc ﬂush, dousing my rump

- (and sometimes my hand) with splashes ofbowl-

water. This is quite unacceptable.

Bicycle and spirit broken} .

It was a beautiful Saturday morning, sunny and
breezy. I swung open the door of Spanish House -
and strolled outside, only to be struck by a grue-
some sight: a'death mound of vandalized bicycles
piled in front onounkcr. My beloved bieyele (per-
baps because it was locked?) had been singled out
for special treatment. It lay alone in the middle of
the field, the metal rim of its back tire twistcd‘ahd
its spokes snapped. A new tire? A new rim? That’s
too expensive for me to the l rode my bike every
day and yonl, you have not only broken my bicycle,
you have broken my heart.
