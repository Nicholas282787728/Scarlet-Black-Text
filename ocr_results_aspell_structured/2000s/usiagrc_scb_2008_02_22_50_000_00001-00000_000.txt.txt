College hires new
dietary consultant

iii/JOHN Buse 8c Snimii Cassmi

What to eat is a question on every students inind two or
three times every day. Now, hopefully, they will 1t least spend less
time \voirying ribon't how healthy then food is the college inst
hired someone to do that for them

Gnnnell College Dining Services hitcd Britt McConnell lot-
this semester to 1ct 1s 1 dicr1ty consultant to the dining hall.
h'lcConncll's job will-he to evaluate whether or not the College’s
dining hall food meets nutritional statidards for students.

Dining Services hired McConnell in response to student 1nd
administration's questions about the nutritional content of the
dining halls food. said Director of Dining Services Dick Wilr
Liams. “Basically, 1 student came up to me 1nd asked me irtt were
possible to actually live offofrhc vegan bar,"VVill.iarns said.

Previously McConnell worked in nursing homes, with chil-t

dren and with Type II diabetics. McConnell said she is ieadv for
the new challenge oi‘ working with a much largei 111d different
npe oi populrtlon.

McConnells position is partrtime. which means she will
be available only once I neek Dining Services said they hope
to make changes throughout the semestet, but any significant
changes will not be cn1ctetl untii e1rly next year. W'h1t we need
to find out is what students want when they ‘more nutt on, "
said “t"illiams.

McConnell said that
from what she has seen
in the dining hall in her

- first month here, she
believes that it provides
adequate nutrition but
that students are simply
not taking advantage of
1ll the dining hall i11s
to offer. “That’s one of
the great things about the (lining hall here,’ she said. “There is
so much variety th1t you c1n choose 1lrnost 1nything, from the
heeltlty foods to the not so herltlty foods

While students such as Henry Reich '09 1greed th1t there
were he1lthy options, he felt that they were not sufficient. “Ev-
eryone gets to eat what they want, but they are never frilly satis-
ﬁed,” said Reich.

Students such as Brie Bieler '11 said they want more variety
and more nutritional, heattier foods.“As a vegetarian and an athr
lete, I sometimes find it hard to make good nutritional choices
that also allow me variety so that I don't become bored with
my meals." said Bieler, who runs on the women's cmssreountry
team.

“I feel that my only sources otprotein become be1ns 1nd tofu
and there's only so much I can do with those before it becomes
dull,"Bieler said. "The Vegan but could also be greatly expnnded,
you know—mot always spicy dishes and maybe some more fresh
fruits and veget1bles."

While students said they are happy that McConnell was
hired they are slightly frustrated that it has taken so long. Some,

like Bicler, think that

the administration has
given no detailed deadr
line as to when they can
etptct rengible, positive
ch1nge. instend, they
feel the answers to be
ingrte 1nd nppeasing.
Students have been
requesting a nutrition
ist on campus for some
time. In tall 2006. a student initiative requestin 1 uuti'iliouist
pitsseti with over 85 percent or the vote Simil 1t nun ivcs were
proposed in spring and ﬁll 200 The issue goes back even tur-
ther. with iointBo1rd eondne 1g resenteh on the position is

early as 2001.

‘Nhilc it my l11ve t1ltcn n11ny years to hnnlly bring the posi-
tion to the college, students still hope thit the hood will become
hotlthter so thnt they e111 instend wotry about the taste.

School examines preparedness
for violent incidents 'on campus

EV OMAR MUNOZ

The recent shooting in Northern Illinois University and last
year's shooting at Virgini1 Tech University have prompted stu»
dents and sero reﬂect on the Grinneil response plans for such
crises and to consider new strategies.

Director of Security Stephen Briscoe said that the college
does its best to stay prepared for a similar incident occurring
1r Gtinnell. The Emergency Response Committee, the body
responsible for such planning, constantly
reviews the college's Emergency Response
Plan. “The Emergency Response Committee
looked into the response pl1n 1nd reviewed it
after VirginiaTech," said Briscoe "We talk to
Grinnell Police about our policies VVerc re
viewing response polices 1g1in. "ortscoe said
that officers have ieacted to the possibility of
violence on campus and changed the way thev

Porter said that while she ﬁnds current policy problematic,
she also ﬁnds it dlﬁ'lcult to imagine any major changes in en-
forcement that would not be challenged by students. “We have
1 hard time dealing with the little things. We would h1ye such 1
bigger problem checking things like begs," said Porter. “If it was
stepped up more we would face more hostility"

Briseoe also said tltrt students play 111 itnportnnt role in
m1int1ining 1 seeure environment by melting sure friends are
ment1lly healthy and by reporting suspir
cious activity. “Students can be more aware
of their surtou ings, aware of people who
ere acting suspicious,” he said. “lrn student
feels like they have a friend who needs extra
help, they h1ve people like Residence Life
Coordinators and Mental Health Services
they can go to."
