That Kid!

A plague upon all our classes

It's a new semester here at crinnell.
whieh [nuns new faces, new classes, new
experiences, and That Same Kid {mm last
semester. somehow, it doesn’t matter ifyou
sign up rorRussian Literatuteorscnlpting
or zoology, That Kid will be there.

in fact, my personal experiences have
led me to believe thatiheThat Kid to Some
Kid ratio is somewhere around i to 15, win.

in the social sciences.

l like think orThnt Kid as n being oi
paradoxes, a student of contradiction, an
oxyMoron. For example, even though That
Kid has closely rmd the materiel rorl tl ass.
he still has no idea what he is talking ahour.
That Kid somehow manages to hinder class»
room discussion through adding to the very
same diseussron.

That Kid kicks the hack oryour chair
and doesn’t stop when you ask, and then
asks the person hehind him to stop ltieking
his chair, sometimes while simultaneously
locking your chair.

it’s not that Thar Kid is just annoying,
it goes mueli deeper thin that, That Kid
touches that deeply hidden part orour soul
where we store our most embarrassing

, moments, our most regretted social hlun.
ders, our rauit pas ﬁle. He is the personiﬁ-
cation or all we want kept hidden; he repe
reseno the sentenees left on the eutting
room ﬂoor ofour brains. Not to mention
that he never shun up.

That Kid comes rrorn all haekgrounds
and genders, all regions and all inaiors, hoth
North and South campus. In faet, outside
or the classroom environment. many of
That Kick can’t even he identiﬁed from
those who an eonduet themselves appro.
priately in the lmrning environment. They
are not neeessarily uneool or unaltmcuvc;
they are not necessarily overly smart or
overly dumh.

That Kid should not he oonrused with
other classroom characters such us The
Nosepieker, who, though he has less then
desirable hohhies sueh :5 wiping his snots
on his soeks, does no real harm nnd actu-
ally adds to how interesting your class is,
especially when he ettavates a big one.

lithey appear to here nondescript, you
might ask, it they don’t necessarily have ta.
pered pants or poor grooming skills. how
can you tell whieh kid is That Kid? well,
That Kids make it verycasy for you to iden.

so you don't have to deal with him? Yes.

It's 'l'hnt Kid.

But the most frightening and terrihle

The best movies

The top-10 picks for the overall best movies of 2001

by Joe Michaels
Guest Columnist

Living in the Midwest, spaciallyzgood
distance from any majormertopolltan cen»
ter, makes it very difﬁcult to compile a
strong topeio list. This year particularly it
seems. studios were keen on releasing their
prcstig: ﬁlms in limited r:leasc, which
means lisu such as this one are rife with
potential omissions (most lamentahly un.
seen: Mama”: Ball). That said, the ﬁlms
includcd are no slouchcs. So without fur-
ther adieu, I offer you the best onOOl.

1. MuUIvled Drive. This is the
one no. .hrainer otthe list. David Lynehs
swirling ltaleidoseopie tale is as eompelling
a film as they come.
From the opening
credits, Lyneh eaptie
vates you with Dnut’s
dreamseope atmo»
sphere. The mood is
suspeer; from disori-
enting to downright
creepy, Lynch and
longtime musical col.
lnhoraror Angelo
Badalamcnti keep
your attention riveted
to their tale of the
amnesiacwoman out
to rediscover her identitywirh the help ora
naive young actress. Naomi watts, as the
young actrns, emerges item the ﬁlm with
the female performance of the year. watch
how cunningly she identities how her su—
dition partner is manipulating her and turns
his own trieks against him. Unforgettshle,
Lynch’s direction is masterly.

2. Mementa. Guy Pearce delivers 2
knockout performanee as Leonard Shelby,
o mm with no short.tetnr memory ti-seke
ing down his wife's murderer in what is case
ily the most thrilling ﬁlm of the year, ..
rcctor/strcenwriterChristopherNolmn tells
his rule with rapid pretirion and an urgency
that grips you irom the outset. The story
compcls. the elriraetert intrigue, and the
performanees (Pence, Cairic»Anl\c Moss.
and Joe Pantoliano) are pitch perfect A
thriller that truly thrills.

3. In the Btdruom. For students

Todd Flcld's famIly drama Veteran Sissy
Spacek immerses herselfin Ruth Fowltr. 1

[In Mullholland Drive] The
mood is suspect; from dis»

the all—round outstanding aeting (include
ing Tom Wilkinson, Nick Stehl. and Will»
iam Maporher) and understated direction,
the film transeends to intermittent script
and stands as a brilliant, telling ehareeter
study.

4. Gosﬁrm’ Park. Rohert Altman’s
murder mystery is less a whodunit than a
dehunking oi the British social disses in
rhe l930s. Altman gracefully directs 23

leads (included
therein are Kristin
Scott Thomas,

Ryan Phillippe.
Emily Watson,
and Maggie

sharp, suhtle en.

masters, and Altman slyly east many onus

cxccutc themselves magniﬁcently. Thomas
and Mitten are of particular note, hut it is
the alwnyswondertul Smith who steals the
show.

some tells a taste ted story amidst erotic
lotales and exhllnrnting action sequeneo.
Director'l‘ony Scott Fu:ls his film with an

The ﬁlm's refusal to talk down to its audir
