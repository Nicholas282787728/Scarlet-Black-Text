Response from the Athletic Director Incntmemersw omig t avequestionsorconcernsa-out

plorablc by the entire department of athletics. This incident has and my email addms is mllaceg@grinnell.edu
placcd our athletes in the role of both female victims and male
perpetrators. It has been an extremely disturbing experience,
as it represents an unacceptable way to treat women students,
women studentcathlotes, teams, coaches, the families ofwomen
and men studenrrathletes, the families ofcoaches and the entire
college campus,

The department has spent hours expressing our individual
reactions to the event in discussions led by Elena Bernal. We
have discussed how we can restore trust across the campus.
Progress has been made since last week, as coaches have met
with each other, individual team members, and teams. This is
just the beginning in a long series of discussions that must take
place. As coaches and professors we understand that we are pro-
vided a tremendous opportunity to have influence on Grinnell
College Snidenteﬂtltlctcs. You need to know we do not take this
responsibility lightly

Education is the key to preventing this type of incident in
the future, and the first step is listening to the victims of the
damaging event. Every student's education at Grinncll College
is short term Students do not arrive at Grinnell College with
the same level ofsensitivity and understanding about what is of-
fensive and unacceptable to others. Ifwc do not learn here and
now, it Will be too late.

While we are far from addressing this situation in its entirety,
I have informed the football team ofthe following punishment
from the Athletic Director’s office that will includc banning any
parties sponsored by the Grinnell College football team or any
or its members for the 201072011 academic year, and beyond,
if necessary. In addition, with .ldvice from the Office of Di-
versity and Achievement, the Office of Student Affairs and the
Real Men organization, an cffccuvc and appropriate sensitivity
training program will be identified. Participation by all football
team members Will be mandatory, and the football team will pay
{or expenses related to this class.

our approach to changing this type of behavior will be all
encompassing as we seek adVicc and guidance from students,
staff, faculty and administration in helping us create change in
the campus climate. I welcome the opportunity to meet with
any individual or group comprised of stair, faculty and/or stue

From the Oninions Editor

The past few weeks have been unfortunate
for many members of the Grinnell commu-
nity. It seems that thou h we try so hard as
a school to foster a sa 9 and trustiri com—
munity, we continually come short. n light
of recent failures of some student groups to
uphold Grinnell»specific socially just values,
some students have taken a defeatist view to-
ward community building activities such as
the open forum held yesterday in IIRC 101i
Some students claim that forums ike these
have done nothing to stop hurtful speech in
the past, and they will not help in the future.
This, I believe, is an overly pessimistic view,
and it should be avoided,

What this experience should show us is
how important it is to express differing opinr
ions. In the end, most incidents such as this
arise from a difference in values—whether or
not one strident group believes that an action
is hurtful, When these stark differences cause
harm to students, it is important for all VleW'
points to be present, in order to have a truly
open dialogue. I believe in using this Opin-
ions section as it way to foster a complete dia-
logue, free from any bias. As Opinions editor,
I romise that if you share your opinon, I will
g adly publish it.

Tierc are always two sides to eve story,
and before we jump the un, both si es de—
serve to be heard. My goﬁ for next year is to
péiint the most accurate and broad picture of

rinnellian opinion that I can manage.

Sincerely

Letter from a former sports editor

So there's not a lot to say about Cunnilingus that hasn't
already been said: It ms an incredibly unfortunate event
that hurts more than just those who were targeted. It was
divisive itnd disheartening for a campus as right-knit and
small as ours. It is embarrassing that we seem unable to
prcvcnt events like this one, or the not that was 10/10,
from happening on our sell-governed campus. Combined
with the shit that happened his: year with the faculty and
Student Affairs, it’s clear that our trust has been shattered.
The only thing we can do now is rebuild it and I know of
at least one way we can do just that: athletics.

I spent a large chunk of my free time this year swiin-
ming and working for this paper as sports editor. I get a
chance to follow all the teams on campus and while some
teams are admittedly more accomplished than others, on
every single team, there is a devotion that builds l‘clilllon’
ships. In interVicws, that devotion to the sport is so over
whelmmgly obvious that I can’t help but get a little tingly.
The purpose ofAthletics is to bring people together and it
ready hurts to see this kind of behavior exhibited by athe
lctes.

But] have faith that its through athletics, sportsmanc
ship and team dynamics that this problem can get litcd.
Earlier this week,l saw a copy of thc letter that was sent
to Athletic Director Greg Wallace, and want to thank Ian
VVnrllck’lo and those who took the time to write that. As
stupid and clithc’ as it sounds, we just need to get every
body on the same team.

Thanks,
