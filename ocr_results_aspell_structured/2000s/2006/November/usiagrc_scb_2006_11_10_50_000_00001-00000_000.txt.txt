Dem tactics raise
turnout, tempers

BYJULU BOTTLES

They staked out a position in front ofthe dining hall, to inter-
cept as many students as possible. Anyone passing by their table
was met hy volunteers waving signs, oltcring campaign stickers and
repeating an rrrsistcnr message: register to vote, and vote Democrat

The weeks before the 2006 Election Day were busy ones for
the Grinnell Campus Democrats, as they sought to bring as many
student votes as possible to candidates Like Eric Palmer. Leonard
Boswell and Chet Culver. Heavy student turnout points to the suc
cess of their measures, but many students have been critical ofwhirt
they see as invasive or annoying tactics.

Campus Democrats hit the pavement early this year. Prc-clcc-
tion day activities included satellite voting, absentee ballot applica-
tions and voter registration errorts The goal was to deliver as many
student votes for Democratic candidates as possible, said member
Lindsay Ayirng 10. We wanted to got out a lot otthe vote around
the college, and we tried to get Grrnnell to vote as a bloc,"she said.

During the day of the election, Campus Democrats tabled
on campus, made phone calls and knocked on doors in town.
Grinncllians also traveled throughout the congressional district to
cities such as O. alaosa and Knoxvrlle.

The Campus Republicans held a very lokaey campaign, Derek
Bates, leader orthe Campus Reprrhircans, said they thought endors‘r
mg a candidate would hurt that person's chances. “With Grinnell
being partieniariy iiherair
slanted, it’s not small to
endorse a candidate," Bates
said. They instead urged
students to make decisions
about each candidate rather
than votrng a straight Dem,
octatic ticket.

Not all students apptccr
ated the aggresswc Demtr
cratic efforts to turn out their votes. Students like Allison W iseo
'08 toolt offense to face-to-facc interactions in public areas such as
the dining halls. “They were harassing students and pushing pres
paganda literature in their races in the dining hall when they were
eating," wrseo sard.
