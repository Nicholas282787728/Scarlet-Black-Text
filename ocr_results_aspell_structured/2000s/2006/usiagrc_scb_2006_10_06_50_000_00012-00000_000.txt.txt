It isn’t hip to use Facebookeom.
I know this. But this doesn’t keep me
from sending out friend requests,start-
ing clubs and tagging my friends in all
my pictures. Every time i log on and
see my face next to a huge ad for Hills
ary Duff’s latest perfume, a little voice
in my head starts screaming, “You are a
massive tool!

So why do I keep coming back? For
the same reason everyone else does.We
all have a little bit of stalker inside of
us. We love Faeebook because it is a
quick and easy database of people from
which we can determine someone’s
personal characteristics without having
to go through that pesky business of
having legitimate social interactions.

For example, when your good rriend
hooks up with some random person
at Harris, it is your duty as a busy
body to find out whether this person
is cool enough to drunkenly lock lips
with your buddy. It would be painfully
awkward and time consuming to seek
out this person and her friends {or in-
terviews about her personality. So, you
decide to turn to Facebook instead. If
her favorite music section looks like the
playlist for your high school prom, her
favorite “book" is Cosmo and all ofher
favorite quotes are from Lagaina Beach,
then you know you need to keep a bets
tcr eye on your friend next week, so as
to keep him from getting massive tool
cootics, Or mono.

But Facebook does more than fat
cilitate our natural semirmonthly urges
to be creepy. It has also formulated an
entirely new schema for interpreting
interpersonal relationships. Back in the
innocent days ofhigh school, before our
social networks could be conveniently
catalogued
and dIS’
played to
us through
the magic
of the Inn
ternet, we
used to
think of our
friends as being those who we talked to
most everyday, sharetl major life events
with and who knew about the embars
rassing crap we used to do in clemen—
tary school, For most people, this was
a fairly select group. With the advent
of Faeebook, hover
ever, we’ve all begun
collecting friends
like pogs, or Mighty
Morphin' Power
Ranger trading cards
(if we want to get
back to embarrassing
things we did in elementary school).

Thcie is a certain sense of pride at
being able to see that you have over a
hundred friends at your college alone.

your friends to easily track your recent
Facebook activity, hundreds of thour
sands of people freaked out, myself
included.

Why? Well, quite frankly, I’m not
terribly comfortable with the fact that
people I went to church with in high
school and my friend’s 14-year-old sib—
lings can see pictures otme drunk and
dressed as a gay lumberjnck on their
home pagcs.The uproar was so intense
that Faeebook quickly apologized and
allowed people to edit their privacy
settings to remove the feed altogether.
This was the moment when our stalker
senses started to creep back to the fore-
front. While some chose to remove
their feeds, many let them go, getting
used to them and even browsing thcin
frequently to see what new informer
tion they could learn about their quash
friends,

So what can we learn about our col—
lege’s experience with Faceboolt? Most—

gossip is drastically more interesting
than statistics homework. I will leave

can literally spend hours learning about

Secret agent can't conceal her red roots

While filling our tax return forms, being sexiled,
and lack of laser vision are pretty high on my Most
Annoying Things Ever list,l have to say that haw
ing long hair indisputably
holds the top spot.

People have always
asked me whyI don't just

or maybe my hair could have taken over the world.
Ihalfexpect to wake up one night and find it running
around outside trying to strangle squirrels. I know it
would be the best weapon were I ever to renounce my
liberal arts degree and become a secret agent,

Not only could my hair strangle people on come

could surtocate him in so seconds tint. My enemies
would have no idea what hit them. “Ms. Rideout,"

Another Communist would be destroyed and Iraq

would once again be safe

And then, with my
cloaking device (hair
covering race), I would
slip off into the night
and no one would know
who that mysterious red
head was. Because, you
know, there are so many girls with waist-length red
hair with whom I could easily blend in.

Now maybe if] dyed my hair purple for my day
job and became one ofthose Barbies who can extend
and retract her hair on command I could follow my
true vocation of secret agenthood, but until then if
my hair decides to go and commit ﬁrstedcgrce murder
(with or without my approval), I think I'll be pretty
easy to identify.

Which I must say is one thingl never could unr
derstand about super heroes. If they’re so super, how
on earth do they think that putting a thin mask over
their eyes will hide their true identity?

Maybe it’ll hide the fact that they have some se-
rious acne in the uppcrrnosc area, but unless one's

identified by the number ofpimples they have (I must
have a very distinct identity then),I don’t see how that
Little bit ofspandex is going to fool anyone.

The question still remains ofconcealing my ideas

particularly want to cut it or dye it, as purple doesn‘t
really go with most of the things in my wardrobe. 1
can't go on an independent spy mission to DC. one
night and the next day have the Little Mermaids
pond surrounded with government van and surveilr
lance subs swimming around her front door. It will be
pretty obvious that the girl running around the White
House in the ninja catsuit didn't have ﬁns.

Unless I base my operations in Ireland. Then, I
could blend in like a Caucastan at Grinnell, Yes, Irer
land will be where I'll base my secret lair. It will be in
an old abandoned castle and there will be a moat filled
with Guinness and speakers blasting fiddle music just
in case any locals hanging around start to doubt my
authenticity (“You’re not really a potato farmer, are
you, lassie?"). And ifthey get too close: ‘bairdmth‘
