JOHN BOWERS

Grinnellians remember Rose-Palermo

"Nonconformist" former Grinnell student died in Arizona last week

BY LOLA GARCIA

A former Grinnell student died in a bizarre
drowning incident this past Valentine's Day.

John RoserPalermo, formerly '05, was 23 when he
plunged into river of an Arizona bridge last week.

According to police reports, he dove mm 12-15
feet of water
wearing only
boxer shorts
and tennis
shoes and
drowned her
{are friends
could save
him.

Police are
still invesrir
gating why
Ru 5 e - Pa le r -
mo dove into
the water during his last semester at Arizona State
University

Rose—Palermo attended McClinmck High in
Arizona and Northern Arizona University before
transferring to Grinueu and majoring in philosophy

“John was an original," said friend Cain Elliot ’06
of Rose-Palermo’s range of interests.

Rose-Palermo was an active student while attends
ing the college. He was an athlete who played both
rugby and football. “He was just a real friendly young
man who enjoyed as much being out and being with
a group ofteammates is he did playing in hallgnmes,”
Coach Greg Vl/allace told The Arizona Republic.

Aunrhertnnnei- football player remembered Rosc-
Palcrmo as someone who enjoyed the fellowship of
his team even ifhe was not the top player. “He was a
really energetic guy who was happy most of the time,”
Franklin Gilmore-Meteor, told the Arizona paper.

He was also an active member ofthe debate team
and competed in the National Parliamentary Debate

”[liosesl’aleimo] was perpetuals
ly riding the wave of ’iiglit now,’
just doing his thing. Hell always
make everyone else’s plans for
life look like lousy attempts at
adventure.”

iAdam Lake ’06

Association Tournament in 2003.

But even as he was always busy, Rose-Palermo's
friends remembered his casual approach to life. “He
was perpetually riding the wave of‘right now,’just doe
ing his thing," said friend Adam Lake ’06. “He'd al-
ways made everyone else's plans for life look like lousy
attempts at adventure."

Still, Rose-Palermo struggled with the Grinnell
community and according to some his experience
here was tumultuous.

“[The Grinnell community] did not want to take
the time to interact with a person who did not Corr
form to the unstated rules that govern our actions,"
said Elliott. "Football players aren’t supposed to be
sensitive intellectuals. Vegetarians aren't supposed to
be rugby players who spend their evenings with Ni-
etzsche and Merleau-Ponty."

Personal problems also haunted Rose-Palermo
and friends say he struggled with dnig use. Elliott
said that the RosCrP‘dlcrmo’s inability to resist“the Ili—
toxicarion of drugs"wasn't hurt by Grinnell students’
acceptance of marijuana use.

“Saying this would have certainly pissed offjohn,”
explained Els
liot-t, “but I
think it’s up
to us to make
5 o m e r h i n
valuable of his
life.”

0 t h e r
friends point
out that Roses
Palermo Sini’
ply wanted to
do something else with his life. “It didn’t surprise
too many people when he dropped out to play poker
around the world," said Lake.
