Ben Cohn ‘08, trombonist

Whats it like playing in this kind of
small venue?

It‘s really nice, actually. I haven’t had
the opportunity to play in a small colt
fct: shop sort of thing before, especially
not because most of my experience has
been for concert hall, like Sebring or
Galdnct.

When you play every Monday, do you
do any rehearsal in between?

It's mostly show up and play, we don't
rehearse those songs outside

Randy Brush, drummer

How do you enjoy working with stur
dents?

I'm having the time of my life. it’s
really neat to see a thing like a jaw.
night in a school like tllis,\vith so many
talented people. and give them an outr
let. Because really the only way you can
learn to playjazz is [0 playjazz, so it is
almost a return to the old ways, if you
will In New York City there's always
a place to play, and this gives people

 

otMonelays. so sometimes
we can he a little rusty, but
usually we try to play things
within the scope of things
we can play right there.

Would you like more op
portunities to play in W“,

 

a place to play. I think that it’s
really neat watching the players
develop,
‘ Is that how you learned to
3 play?

I guess from a jazz stand-
point, I was kind ot’a big-band
drummer as a kid. and then I

 

 

ues like this?

Personallyl'm reallyhusy,hutl think
it’s definitely nice to see a move on cam-
pus towards mole informal lnusic, just
playing in from ofpeople. I think it's a
great way to just become horror at your
instrument, It deﬁnitely helps I think
more tor improvising to play in front of
people, and it 5 really nice to see kind of
an open jazz scene where anyone can
playing deﬁnitely not limited to peOr
pie who show up every week but there
are new people that show. There’s an

toured for a year with a group

called Up With People and then l

went into the Air Force Band, but on

the East coast. so I started going on

weekends up to New York City to hang

* ML clubs, of course I was plays

22 in the Air Force Band. I just

kind of developed kind of a four-year

love affair with Manhattan, I ended

up moving up there after and teaching

drum set and that was whole I got in-
volved with the wholejazz scene.

How do you think the students have

Oh, I think it is very noticeable.
lts certainly noticeable to me. The
technique is smoother, the mechanics
of lnusic is smoother, but also they are
able to more quickly come together as
a group. The solos are becoming more
suresrootcd. It's really quite gratifying.
I really am pleased to be part ofit.
And how is the interaction betwccn
members while they are aetually play-
ing?

lt' getting better and better. I
think initially because lt was kind ofan
unknown entity, it’ you will, for some of
the people, that you just have to get up
there and play, Everyone was a little
more nervous, I can’t think of a word
for it other than nervous.

But now everyone is feeling com-
fortable with each other, there is a level
otcomtort with the group, We pmr
ﬁled the freejazz portion this past time
starting at nine o’clock and everyone
got in on that.

Do you think it's going to continue
on?

I'm sure hope it will.1 thinkitwlll. I
think Kevin [Plattner’og] talked about
it some last year and it just never came,
to such a permanent fruition as this. 1
hope it will carry on forever.

Andyou llhe involvedwith for aslong
as”

As long as there is breath In my

open aspect.

When The Elected play in Gardner to—
night, don't be surprised if lead singer Blake
Sennell looks strangely huoiliar. Some people
may recognize him from his other hand, Rilo
Kile), but many will know him from his roles
as a child actor Senuett played Ronnie Pinsky
on Salute Your Show and Joey the Rat' Epr
stein on BaylW’tts War-Id. However, as he got
older, he switched paths, and joined with tel-
low actor Jenny Lewis to form Rilo Kiley.

Sennctt created The Elected as a side piojr
eet. To complete the hand, Selinett was joined
by Rilo Kiley drummer Jason Boesel, Ozma
bassist Daniel Brummel and Mike Bloom.
On the band’s debut album, M: First, Sen-
nett showed his country inﬂuences that were
hinted at in Rilo Kiley albums.

Last year, the band released their sopho—
more alhum Sun, Sun. Sun. The album main»

ﬁrst release, but shows more of the pop leans
ings that are seen in Rilo Kiley records. At
times the alhuun sounds like a heavily pop-
inilueneed Bright Eyes record, and sennett's
voice evokes memories of his late friend Elliott
Smith.
