From Grinnell to the Guggenheim

Much lauded poet Edward Hirsh ’72 returns for reading and reminiscence

Bv BRENDAN MACKIE

In 1968 the freshman ioommltte
of Edward I-lirsh ’72, a fellow football
player, asked for a now room after re-
alizing Hirsch was not just a football
player but a poet. Hirsch had the room,
a double on Loose 2"“, to himself for
the rest of the year.

It was not the hsr thing poetry
would get Hirsch. He would Win Glin’
neil’s selden Whitcomb poetry prize as
a sopiunore, And as a junior. And as a
senior. He would win :1 Watson felloWe
ship. He would publish one book after
another. He wollld become a profes-
sional poet.

Monday night
Ed Hirsch returned
to the first place he
ever heard a poetry
readingi the hume
ble Forum South
Lounge — now the
author of six books
of poetry and three
books of nonvfiction (including the
bestseller How lo Road {1 Poem and Fall
in Low tot/I: Poetry). the winner of
numbers awards and grants and the
president of the Guggenheim Founda-
tion. Hirsch is perhaps the most famous
writer Grinnell has produced.

“It's moving to be back in the Fae
rum for me," Hirsch said in an inter»
view after the reading. “Because so
much of what was formative to me in
poetry happened here. Every poetry
reading 1 ever heard for my life between
1968 and 1972 took place here] didn't
really hear other readings until after
that." With the Joe Rosenﬁeld Cam-

pus Center opening next year, however,
Hirsch's reading on Monday night my
be the last poetry reading in the Forum
for a while.

While the structure of the campus
has changed a lot since the early scvens
ties, Hirsch says the campus feels very
much the same.

“I've been back before,” Hirsch said.
“but every timel come i feel my young
or self hero and I feel what it meant for
me to be here, and how dramatic it was
for me to be here, and how intense. Ev-
erywhere you go, because the campus is
so small, you have a sort of Proustian

recall of what haps
pened to you and
how it feltr"

What Hirsch
found at Grinnell
was his professional
poetic path and a
humane morality
learned through the
liberal arts. "The
liberal arts education I gor ar Grinnell
set me on a life path," Hirsch said. This
education has never left him. “For me,
[the Guggenheim presidency] is the
maximum version of the liberal arts
education. The Guggenheim feels like
the fulfillment of that idea of support—
ing people in all different ﬁelds in all
different walks of life, in terms of their
creative work." The Guggenheim
Foundation provides grants to individ-
uals in 78 ﬁelds, from sciences to the
humanities to choreography Hirsch is
its fourth president in 80 years.

Hitsch's Grinnell education initi-
ated him in the liberal arts, and he be

licves all Grinnellians to have a respoir
sibility to the “humane values" we pick
up here. ”Those values are under threat
in the culture,” he said. “We have a task
to keep something alive at a time when
it's being threatened. I think that the
commitment to open—mindedness, the
commitment to creativity in so many
different fields, the commitment to 50*
cial consciousness is a way of rhinking
that Grinnell gives you that sets you on
your path."

Grinnell not only gave Hirsch a
sense of the values which would lead
him through life, but gave him a con
fidence that his ideas and actions mat-
teredl-lirsch thinks that this conﬁdence
allows Grinnelliarls to get out into the
world and do things of significance.
“Doing anything significant takes a
kind of faith because long before you
have any real evidence that you can do
it, you have to have the faith to believe
that you can do. And I think Grinnell
instills that faith in you because what
you do feels important ...We have a re
sponsibility to what we have become or
what we might become. "

Hirsch maintains strong ties to
Grinnellians,both to his former teache
ers and to Grinnell students, coming

back to campus every few years to give-

readings.

After the reading, Hirsch spent
over an hour signing books and chat-
ting with his old teachers and students.
He offered advice, listened to praise
and signed books. And he spoke vvrth
some current Grinnellians, who will
soon leave Grinnell to follow their own
paths.

From nuns to nudes

Bv Jose SEGEBRE—SALAZAR

A nude model lies on the floor with his legs against the wall
as Natalie Larson ’07 captures him in a charcoal drawing.

Her artwork, which consists mainly of charcoal drawings
and monoprints, is realistic. She rdmirs to having issues with
more abstract artwork and prefers the creative leeway charcoal
provides her

It' is this room to create and innovate that attracts her most
to art. ‘I am comforted by the fact that the identity of an artist
is so ﬂexible,” Larson explained. With charcoal figure drawings,
she can communicate a diversity of feelings, ideas and forms.
Larson particularly enjoys the searching for the form through
lines.“l like the gesture," she said. Her drawings of a nude model
in several poses recently got some frontepage press as the cover
for The Salad.

Larson’s life has been marked by as much ﬂexibility as her
art. She began at Grinnellas a Philosophy major, but decided to
transfer to another college, and then try life as a nun. After al—
most a year of trying to decide between two sharply contrasting
lifestyles, Larson came back to Grinnell. Still a devout Catholic
when she returned to Grinnell, she was not able to cope with
the questioning nature of Philosophy She could only ﬁnd the

“comfort zone she needed in art.

After these very emotional and formative years in her life,
Larson decided art was the calling to which she would devote
her life. Art not only provides comfort while Larson worked
through the turmoil' in her life, but the process of transforming
a blank canvas, a piece of arches or Plexiglas provides her with a
very rewarding outcome.

. “Art is really frustrating," Larson said, “You always wonder:
Is it any good?” She admits being passionate about art, but she
still struggles with mastering the technicalities According to
Larson, perspective is one of her main problems.

Larson is only a junior, but hopes to graduate early As a},
ways, she is looking ahead down several very different paths in
life: she is planning to ply to Yale, the New York Academy of
Fine Arts and lndiana llniversity.
