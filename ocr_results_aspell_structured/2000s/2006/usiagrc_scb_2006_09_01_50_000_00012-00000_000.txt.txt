Women’ s soccer sets Sights high behind Diedrick

BY NATE LINDSEY

The women’s soccer team is coming oeta
Midwest Conference championship last sear
son, but Kate Diedrick ’07 wants to do belr
ter this year. The forward joins goalkeeper Liz
Carrier '07 as returning Pioneers who earned
first team all-Midwest Conference honors last
season and hope to lead their team deeper into
the national tournament after last year's sec-
ond-round loss. 7

Also returning is second team all-Cont
fercnce selection Rebecca Mackenzie ’09, the
team's leading scorer with 13 goals last year.
Defender Hannah Sayle ’02, who captains the
team with Diedrick and Carrier, brings experir
ence to a team selected by eight of ten MWC
coaches to win the title this year.

With all ofthe preseason accolades and re—
turning stars in place, Diedrick says that she
is “pumped” for the new season. She has every
reason to be, and the season promises to add
to an already impressive list ofteam and indie
yidual accomplishments.

In Diedrick’s first three seasons, Grinnell
won two Midwest Conference championships
and earned two trips to the NCAA Division
III natronal tournament. The English major
played an important role on the soccer team
each yeai,becoming a permanent starter in her
sophomore season.

She earned her dominant role on the team
by her ability to quickly adjust from the role
she played in high school, said head coach
Heather Benning.

“When Kate came to Grinnell, she was
used to being a fronrrunner who had long balls
served into her that she would track down
with her speed and convert on goal, Benning
said. “Because we play a short passing game,
Kate had to adjust her style of play."

And adjust is exactly what she did. Died-
rick is coming offa year in which she scored

Her selfrproclaimed “worst memory" of
the season came when she earned her second
yellow card, a subsequent red card, and an ejec

tion from the teams NCAA tournament qual-
iﬁev against Carroll last year larc in rhc sccorrd
halfas Grinnell trailed by a goalt

"You've got to keep your cool for the ream,"
Diedrick said. "If we would have lost that
game,l would have felt like it was my fault."

While Diedrick admits to being an aggresr
sive player, she said she's learned heI lesson
from lastyear and is glad things turned out the
way they did.

“I‘m glad my team was strong, and when
adversity hit, stepped up, tied the game and
went on to heat Canal! in a shoot out."

Benning said Diedrick’s passion will be
missed and remembered by teammates and
coaches after she graduates.

“She loves the game ofsoccer, she wants to
perform well and she believes in what Grinncll
women's soccer is all about,"Benning said.

Diedrick believes her role on the team
includes being a leader and influencrng the
younger players. She also hopes to improve
upon the secontlrronnd NCAA Division III
tournament exit ofa year ago.

“I want to leave Orinnell and be able to
say [that] every year I was here, the team got
better, and that means going deeper into the
natronal tournament [this season]," Diedrick
said. “We're last, strong, and excited. We can

, do it."

No matter what happens this year, the
PIoncct soccer team is in good handsiot
feetifor the future, judging by Diedrick's cnt
thusiasm about the secondryear Mackenzie's
abilities.

“Have you ever seen her?” Diedrick asked.
“She can kick the hall 60 miles per hour."

The Pioneers kick off the season with a
home game against Carleton College tomor-
row at 2 pm.

Qrarterbaeks are media darlings, and
punters are more often scapegoats than stars.
But Sean Pfalzer ’07, an honorable mention
ail-Midwest conference punter last seasonr
has managed to garner a lot of attention.

Of course, Pfalzer was also an honor-able
mention allrMidwest Conference quarter
back.

When he was not busy being the team's
top passer (1834 yards) and punter (2295
yards, 36.4 per punt) last season, the versa-
tile Pfalzer gained enough rushing yards to
frnish 40 yards behind team leader Lance
Burkholder '08. If not for yards lost due to
quarterback sacks counting against his [otﬂlr
the signal-caller would have led the team in
that category too.

Ifthnt weren't enough, Pfalzer's versatility
extends beyond the field. To say Pfalzer has
a “full plate" on the football field is an undetr
statement and a bad pun r he's the resident
chefat his house on High Street.

“I'm pretty much the head chef of the
house," Pfalzer laughed. "[My roommates]
would probably go hungry without me."

Whether or not that claim is true, the
Moraga, Calif, chef and football star will
need more than his trademark omclettes to
tor a meager Pioneer offense that frnished
eighth in the league in total offense last year.
Coming offa season that Pfalzet described as
frustrating, he is confident that the offense is
much improved.

Ffalzer hopes to do his part by greatly
lowering ius interceprron [oml last year (18)
to just a handful this year, He also empha-
sized his desire to improve his passing gamc
after racking up more yards printing than
passing last seiIson,To do so, he will rely on
an oifense that returns its top three runners
and top three receivers from a your ago and
has a more expe cuced offensive lute.

Among the returning offensive players

is second team all Conference selection I()le
Perry ’08. who led the team with 44 catches
and 691 yards a year ago. Burkholder, C. 1.
Moore ’09 and Todd Doleshal ’09 all return
after combining for over 650 rushing yards in
2005.

They hope to gain ground behind an often-
sive line that returns second team all- MWC
selection Jonathan Antrim 09. Compared to a
team that began last year with very few return»
ing starters, Pfalzer has a lot more weapons
around him

Head coach Greg Wallace feels that Pfalr
zer is a leader who can utilize these weapons
and help the team because ofmore thatjust his
physical abilities.

“Sean has a lot of the intangibles," Wallace
said, pointing out that Pfalzer is a good runs
ning quarterback who knows when to tuck the
bail and take off, “You can’t teach a guy to feel
pressure and be able to run...some [quarters
backs] have a sixth sense. They know how to
get out oftrouble.”

Wallace also said he might make his way
over to High Street for an omelet ifhe receives
an invite,joking that the egg product is a little
easier to make than other dishes on which a
cook might hang his har--er, apron

Breakfast and footbrIU aside, Pfalzer was
also a regular contributor on rhc Pioneer bas-
ketball team in the 2004,2005 season before
missing last season due to a shoulder surgery.
He plans to return to, the team tlus year, if
healthy.

The history major even practiced some as
a backup place kicker last season. is there any
thing Pfalzer cannot do)

“I defrnitely can’t sing or dance.“ he sard.
“[Bur] I can Juggle."

Of course, we already knew that. You
can’t be a passer, punter, rushcr, l-listor-y ma-
joi', backup kicker, hous‘e chef and baskerhali
player without doing a little juggling.
