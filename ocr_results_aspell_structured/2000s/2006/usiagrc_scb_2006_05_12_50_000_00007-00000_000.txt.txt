Mental Health Special

Three years removed

As seniors graduate, editor urges Grinnellians to connect

Part of the role of a campus newspaper is to record history for a student body
whose collective memory lasts only four years, As this academic year comes to
a close, Grinncll risks forgetting the tragedy that paralyzed the Grinnell com—
munity in spring of2003.

Next week will mark three years since the end ofthe tragic semester when
Amy Wilson, Lenko Stefanov and lonathan Raxtet committed suicide. The
last remaining class that experienced the loss of these three students will soon
graduate and leave Grinnell. The many students who were forever changed by
the deaths will be permanently scattered If these tragedies are forgotten, not
only the students memories but also the community empathy generated by then
deaths will be lost.

This special section of the 3ch 1s dedicated to Amy, Lenko and jonathan.
In 2003, under the guidance of Editorvinichief Katie Moms ’03, the staff pub
lished a special edition nfthc stall to help the community cope. With this int
sert,we hope to memorialize these students, increase awareness of mental health
issues on campus and reflect wlth the many people who were permanently af-
fected by the deaths of their peers, friends and students. Before the seniors leave,
we can grieve together, ‘

on Monday Jan. 13, 2003, Amy Wilson, a petite and artsy second—year stu~
dent, committed suicide at her home in University City, Mo. Wilson, known

for her playful smiles, affectionate notes and creative gifts, poured love onto’

‘hel many friends She threw herself into the art pm] 'ects that covered the walls

of her dorm room and kept working on the small details until the artwork was
complete Her friends suspect that Wilson kept quiet about her struggle with
depression so as not to worry them.

Months later, right before Hell Week, Lenko Stefanov, a gangly and funny
third year student, committed suicide' in his dorm room and was found by secu—
rity‘ and police. Lenko grew up in Bulgaria and served 1n the Bulgarian military
before coming to Grinnell. An SA on Younker 2"“, a member of the men's soar
our team and a dedicated economics student who won a prestigious intemship,
Lenko seemed to be able to successfully balance everything in a Spanish class,
he told everyone he was going to have 10 children. In broken Spanish, the class

joked about the difﬁculty of ﬁnding a wife and a car that could accommodate
that many-children, but maybe he could pull it off. He rarely asked for help, so
even close friends didn’t know the extent of his problems,

Just four days later another (hirdeycat student, Jonathan Raxter, commit-

ted suicide.Jo11athan, :11 Mathematics major and member of Qiizbuwl, invented
Munchies, a green shiny sock cater that, along with his North Carolina drawl
and gleeful giggle, cheered 11p friends when they were going through rough
times. Though Jonathan rarely discussed his own depression, friends recalled a
pervasive sadness that he often masked with outbursts of silliness. His profes—
sors noted when he failed to complete assignments despite his intelligence. Like
Amy and Lenko, Jonathan rarely discussed his depression and devoted a lot of
energy to caring for friends.

After Lenko and Jonathan’s deaths, the campus community came together
to cope with the lossMany oius were physically uncomfortable being alone, We
attended study breaks, counseling sessions, open discussions and memorial scr-
vicebanything available to work through our grief as a community We talked
to acquaintances we hadn’t bothered to check in with in months or years to offer
and get support. We would walk by students we didn’t know, look each other in
the eyes, and see our own gtiefreﬂected back at us. For once, everyone was will»
ing to talk about personal strugglcs with grief and mental health.

The next year, there was a palpable tension between returning students and
the new class of first years that haunt shared in the experience. Each year that
has passed, the divide has decreased, not because each year students become
more aware of mental health issues, but rather because mental health has faded
from campus discourse. Student Affairs otters greater institutional support to
students with mental health problems, but publicly, the issue has all but disap-
peared Students who still struggle with grief about Arny, Lenko and Jonathan
or face their own mental health problems encounter a campus mlture that did
not permanently transform in the wake of disaster. We all thought a closer
commuriitywas inevitable, but we were wrong. Students no longer look out for
students they do not know or reveal personal struggles outside private settings.

Those of us who still grow nervous when we hear sirens often keep quiet.

The community that grieved together has ceased to grow together. Hoper
fully, the resources within this section will educate students about the mental
health resources on campus and bring students together We hope that the in-
formation about mental health at Grinnell now and the perspectives ofpcople
who contributed to the memorial issue we published almost exactly three years
ago will help students manage the intense, intellectual and emotional experience
of Grinnell.

Former editor remembers

Alumnus reflects on community response to tragedy

When I think back to that week, I remember a community in crisis. Lenka
had died on Monday, and on Friday afternoon, when Jonathan died, everything
pretty much shut down; suicide was no longer an isolated event. It was the
weekend before ﬁnals, and everyone was just wandering around 111 a daze I don’t
really remember much of what we actually did; I vaguely remember all campus
meetings, watching mindless movies, but mostly I remember being afraid of
anything sudden: phones ringing, people busting into rooms, anyone running
across campus. Maybe it had happened again.

My parents, in their own sweet Iowa way, didnt know how to help so they
brought my friends, mostly sens staffers, barbeque ﬁxings that Sunday, and we
all sat on my front porch on Broad Street eating veggie burgers wondering what
we could do to help .We realized that we wanted to do something and what we
knew how to do together was to make a newspaper.

' So we put out another issue of the seals. We wrote lung proﬁles of J0m-
than and Lenko, collected resources on depression and suicide and provided
a place for community members to publish what they’d written on Plans or to
themselves or to their studentsd‘d forum for us all to talk about what had hap—
pened.

Like many others, we were surprised to ﬁnd that there wasn't much aware
ness of how prevdenr depression was on campus. So we wrote 11 column as a
newspaper stuffabout our own collective history of mental 11111css we wrote
that most of us had been in therapy, and more than half ofus had been on an—
tidepressants. We talked about our experiences with eating disorders, substance
abuse, self-mutilation and 0CD. Basically, we talked about how crazy we were,
hoping 11 would help people understand that mental illness was rampant on
campus, not just an isolated problem for it few students.

The suicides made vivid how potent Grinnell's community was~and 1 hope
isiin both bad and good ways. thnncll's community for all of its strength,
often subsumed me. I remember as a student calling my group of friends a house
of cards, that we were all this precariously balanced system, and when any one
piece fell, we all fell as well. And I needed that lit the time; I needed .to learn that
people can care about each other and about me so much that we ll all put our
own lives and our work and ollt sanity on hold if needed But thats not wally
a way to live long term, at lenst not if every member of that little rightly kni't
community is on the brink all the time.

The suicides brought into focus how precarious that balance was for llll of us,
as a community of 1,400, not just as 1 household ofdvc or a stufforls. We all
depended on each other for support, and collective pain hurt .1ll of us. B111 that
week also showed how we could pull together—I remember watching Amrlit'
at Eric Simpson's house, talking to random professors who patrolled campus

at night looking for lonely students, listening to the Too Many Strings band at
St. Paul's, People didn't know what to do but that didnt stop them from doing
something.

What I’m trying to say is that what I took away’from that week, as cliché
as it sounds, was a deep appreciation of the power of community. It’s not tharl
had a blast at Grinnell, that every day was a walk in the park with my brilliant
friends and professors surrounding me 111 that utopian bubble. But with the
amazing people 1 met there, 1 got through a lot ofmy own issues, we all learned
how to take care of each other find how to take care of ourselves, Those are the
things that I needed to take with me out into the big wide world. Because after
all this crisis,we did have to go out into the world.

The paper came out and a few more days ofctisis passed and my class gradu—
ated and everyone left to start their new lives. And that was supposed to be the
end of that. Which of course it wasn't. We all still carry that week and those
memories with us. I don't think I?“ the only one who thinks about it all the
time,

So what do I want to say now? First and foremost, that pretty much we're all
fine. Just like people needed to know then that we were all crazv,1 hope it helps
now to know that it can get better. we're all functioning se ~ltdults, doing
pretty interesting things all over the world, I'm in New Orleans running 1| vol-
unteer relicfopemtiou,De11uy David 1s dire ting programming for queer youth
in San Francisco, Amanda Davis is following her radio dreams in NYC, Sarah
Alwnnl is teaching English 111 Japan; Michael Andersen is lm oullne content eds
1tor for 11 newspaper 111 Washington state, Adam Pottilla is doing graph1c design
in Chicago, Jcn Walsh is in psychology grad school 111 Micl1igau,Aly Bccry is
teaching middle school 111 l<.1ns.1s.And,morc1n1pcrtantly,lth1nkwe're .1ll sauer
than we were in school. Maybe a little more lonely, but in crisis less often. And I
think I'm able to be sllner because ofwhat I learned about myself at Grinnell.

I'll never live in another community like Grinnell; I’ll live in other commu—
nlljes that I love, but they won't be as close, and they won't be as nllrconsumlng.
The highs won't probably be as high, but the lows wont be as low other. So
while you’re there, appreciate all of the good l’ll'lngSilhrOW great parties, sit
around at tho forum, watch the rain 1n front of the pubs building, know your
friends would do anything for you—but don’t let the bad parts do you in. Leave
Grlnnell every once in 11 while Donr forget about everything else thats out
there Don’t forget that the world really wont end if your p lpct sucks or you
fail 11 class or you have to take a semester off. one of the good things about that
week' is that it put so much' in perspective. lhe only things that really mattered,
that reltlly over matter, are the people.
