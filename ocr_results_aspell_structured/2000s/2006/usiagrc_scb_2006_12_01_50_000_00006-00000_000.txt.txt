How HARRIS PARTIES AFFECT GRINNELL CAM

BVDAVID LOGAN

Halloween night was one of the ﬁrst times Sarah Evans '10 ever attended a
Harris party. "I was excited, but just not [expecting anytlling]," Evans had to work
before the party, shc said, so she didn't have tivne to become particularly anxious or
etcited,“Basieally,I put together clothes that didn’t match and said I got dressed in
the dark."She has since been to at least three more Harris patties.

otten viewed as the social mecca otcrinncll weekends, Harris parties certainly
occupy a main focus of Grinnell's social Life, gathering more students in one place
than nearly any other event. Despite its prominence, Harris does not appear to be
the perfect social activity for all Grinncllians.

Some students who frequented Harris parties believed the events’ status as a
social focal point facilitated greater camaraderie among the student body. Citing the
festive atmosphere and centrality of Harris, Adam Brumer ’07, director ofGrinnell
Student Security, who also said he has attended a handful of Harris parties this year,
said, “It is deﬁnitely a positive. Harris brings
people together."

Some even mentioned that the prevalence
of sexual encounters and the free alcohol as
fostering greater community “I've even met
some students who came as prospies and
decided to come to Grinnell speciﬁcally after
going to a Harris party," Brumcr said.

Many students say that even oi'Fcampus
parties sometimes revolve around Harris. Liza
Coburn ’09 does not normally attend Harris
parties, but still feels the eﬂ’ects of Harris
culture. “Usually at other parties, there’s a time
everyone leaves to go to Harris,"shc said.

Logan Lewis '07 agreed, saying that ottecampus parties are “just prcpartics for
Harris."

But despite the centrality ofl-larris, some question whether Harris helps campus
atmosphere.'lhe reputation of Harris- deserved or not— apparently deters wider
student participation. Students seeking more discreet forms of entertainment and
social interaction might, according to those interviewed, may be deterred by the

' events reputation for drunken sexual exploits

in the dark with bad music playing loudly Not attracted by the carousing purport-
edly oﬁered by Harris, many snidents seek out alternative means of entertainment
or create their own.

Harris parties are especially popular among underclassinen. Jessica schotts '10
goes to Harris every weekend with her friends. “Usually I see most of the same
people there,” she said.

Cobum acknowledged going to the parties more frequently during her ﬁrst year
for lack otorhcr options. “1 usually just went because everyone else was there," said

”The peop/e who go to Harris
without friends [Intending lo
hookup], and leave by them-

Lewis telt Harris is more popular among underclassrncn, because it offers a place
to get alcollol.“It was an excuse to drink a lot and do stupid shit," he said. Now, he
goes to oﬂlcampus parties instead.

Most students acknowledged that Harris’s reputation for riotous partying is not
entirely undeservedbut also said the occurrence otsuch episodes was not as frequent
as popularly believed. While all interviewed cited the presence of alcohol as a detere
rent to some students, Brumcr said that serious alcohol related disturbances were
especially infrequent this year

As to the purported lewdncss ofHarris, some disagreed. Thats a stigma about
Harris that's not entirely true,"said Neil Finnegan ’09 who has attended Halloween
and Fetish this year. “Though that does happen, most people don't go to Harris
with the express intention of hooking up."According to Finnegan, most people go
to dance or to enjoy the party ambiance; the “extracurricular" activities are usually
incidental.

Even if incidental, alcohol and sexual themes are prominent at most Harris
parties. Most students drink heavily before going to Harris. Daisy Fuentes ’09, who
sometimes works security at Harris, noted that at the larger, themed parties, more
people tend to come from other parties,but it rarelyprescnts a problem.“They already
come intoxicated and it gets out of hand but that's only sometimes,"she said.

For many, drinking is a central part of the “Harris experience.”“Harris from my
point ofview is just a place to go and get drunk in public,"said Danny Zamora ’08,
who rarely goes to the parties.

Schotts has gone to Harris weekly all semester, but since the beginning of
basketball scason,she goes without drinking at all. "It doesn't seem as fun [Without
alcohol],"slac said,“but I still go. It's still fun."

Sex is incorporated into many themes such as Fetish or Underwear Ball, and
hookingeup, however unintentional, is also not uncommon.

“Some people go there with the expectation othooking-up," said coburn. co-
hurn worries that this expectation can have negative effects when students end up
leaving alone.

Lcwis,wlro went to Harris frequently his
ﬁrst two years at Grinnell,said he did not go
with the anticipation of hookingeup, but said
that it still happened frequently. “It's an outlet
for that kind ofthing,” he said. “NowI see it
as being immature,but not wrong."

For some, these incidents were unfortu—
nate. “I think by your senior year, hopefully
you've realized that Harris is not a place for
hookingeup,"said Erumer. “The people who
go to Harris without friends [intending to
hook up], and leave by themselves, that’s some fucked-up shit."

Even students who would otherwise be undaunted by the pervasive alcohol and
