Molly Kaﬂm’ob grew up on a farm in Avon,
SD. (popelario .sol). She's nor your srsreue
rypieal farm girl, though. “I don't wear Wmn‘
glers or shiekickers [cowboy boots]" she said.
Mosr of her high school friends have finished
up associare degrees in South Dakoea and now
live on farms wnh parenrs or new husbands.

Molly has a girlfriend and will move ro
New York City arrer graduanon. Molly is also
nor your average Grinnelllunr She mowed
lawns to help pay for college and she is an
English major who hares

Molly came to Grinnell
no escape rhe dreary life of
rural Sauth Dakoea She now
sees value in rhar lircsrylc,
even ifit is not for her.

“What I’vc learned most here is eharl am
no hener shan anyone back home," she said.
“we're all happy in our own ways."

Molly was never able to reconcile her idcns
tity wirh rhosc in her homerown unril recenrly.
Growing up, she knew thae she was different
and felt underappreeiared. For example, when
Molly wanted to rravel to Denmark and be-

dent. people were more dismayed than exeired.
“I played haskerhall ar rhe nme and rhe school
superinrendenr kept saying, ‘lhink about your
team,” she said. Molly wenr anyway.

When tnlldngnbourhellifebefmc Grinnell,
Molly describes llcrsclfas “a bookworm rebel.”
In elementary school, Molly seayed in during
re 55 to read, while everyone else played oure
side. In high school, she sat ar home pencihng
in huhhles on pracrice ACTs while her friends
enjoyed themselves, Mosr in her family, her

fndlcr especially, always en-
couraged her. Everyone else
was less supporrive. When
Molly approached her high
school guidance counselor
for advice on out-of-smte liberal arrs colleges,
she was rurncd away. “I lelr like someone al-
ways wanred ro clip my wings,” she said.

Molly came to Grinnell College heeanse it
seemed like a good oppornrnrry to express her-
sclf'dnd keep up her hookworm ways. Since are
riving, she has been involved in a hodgepodge
of campus groups, including rhe Young, Gifted
and Black Gospel Choir. English Dcpanmem
SBPC and rhe campus hipehop group, in a
break wirh rhc ennservarive Chrisrian values of

many in her home comrnuniry, she also came
out ﬁrst year and became aerive in rhc Stenc-
wall Coalition.

Money has always prevenred her from
running eoo fax from her pase Molly is a ﬁrst-
generarion college srudenr ﬁnancing her own
educaiinn. She has worked two ro rhree jobs
every semester.

Ar ﬁrst, Molly justiﬁed spending so much
money on her educaeion by comparing herself
ro people hack home. “I rhoughr ihae I really
had ro dcfcnd myself and to explain whyI
was going no he a better person because 1 went
ro Grinnell," Molly said.

Over time, Molly has becomc more com
formblc with herself at Grinnell. Sh: sLill gals
into the occasional spat with her sister, who
attends South Dakota State University, about
rhe price diilrerenee herwcen rhe schools, bur
she does not need the sense of superioriry to
feel secure ahour footing Grinnell’s hefty bill.

Mrer college, Molly leaves for New York
Ciry ro work on a movie set as a produerion
assistant. She will brew coffee, fctch dry cleans
ing and make barely enough money to gen by.
“I just feel compelled ro go to New Yorle" she
said. And that's reason enough.
