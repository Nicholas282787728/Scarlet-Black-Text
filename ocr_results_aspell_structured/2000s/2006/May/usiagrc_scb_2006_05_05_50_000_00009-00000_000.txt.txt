Standing up for tho who speak out

I have spent a lot of time thinking
over Chuck Elickson’s resignation and
the charges of sexual harassment ﬁled
against him. I have known for some
time what the charges were against
him and knew as much before I wrote
and submitted a letter to the adminiSz
tration in midrApril.

My letter was a personal account of
my experiences with Chuck including
the important role he has played in my
life as an RLC, the SRC director, and
a supportive adult on campus. Chuck
has been an invaluable support to me-

I could not have made it through the
year wrthout him. Nonetheless,1 must
clarify a few things.

To begin, the quotes taken from
my letter and printed in the we were
taken out of context; I was making a
general statement of my encounters
with Chuck and in no way implied
that the comments reported as sexual
harassment were meant to be seen as
humorous.

There is nothing funny about sex»
ual harassment. I have always believed
that when someone says they have been

sexually harassed, they are telling the
truth, While I truly respect Chuck and
the role he has played in my life,I know
Becca would not make a complaint un-
less she was violated.

There is a lot ofshame and stigma
that follows sexual harassment and it
takes courage to come forward, esper
cially in a small, rumor—infested cam-
pus like Grinnell.

In our campus bubble, it is easy to
forget that sexual harassment can hapr
pen here, to someone we know. It is
even easier to forget that the perpetra-

tor can be someone we know and ads
mire.

I have been faced with an excruci—
ating dilemma of supporting a victim
ofscxual harassment or supporting my
mentor and friend. I have battled ins
cessantly with this issue and while I am
still struggling with Chuck’s absence, I
cannot betray my conscience.

I stand in solidarity with Becca
Weiner and I. commend her for not
yielding to the silence which surrounds
sexual harassment.

Admissions should reflect Grinnell's core values

Last week, Emilia Giirvey’s article “Predicting the
class of‘10" pointed to the excellent job admissions
has done at recruiting a diverse group of students to
Grinnell. Indeed, the largest group of students ofcol—
or ever was admitted to the class of2010.Yet despite
these gains, Grinnell’s admission policies surrounding
standardized tests still contradict our core value of a
diverse and socially responsible learning community,

According to standardized testing optional ads
vocate Fairtest, there rs a positive linear correlation
between average SAT scores and family income. The
SAT directly favors richer students, as these students
can increase their scores by hiring tutors who teach

them how to take the test and manipulate the sysr
tem.

Jim Sumner, dean ofadmissions, claims that these
score discrepancies do not cause but rather reﬂect
discrimination in America's education system. How
ever, this claim still does not justify requiring stan-
dardized tests, as standardized test scores are a poor
indicator of college success. For instance, Bates colr
lege recently found that the difference in mean GPA
between their students who did and did not submit
tests scores was a mere .05 (out of 4.0). And since be-
coming testing optional, more racial minorities and
lowdncome students applied and were accepted to

Bates, increasing its diversity.

To me, Bates' findings are clear evidence that
standardized tests are not necessary in college admis-
sions and that by requiring them, we are only limiting
the diversity of Grinnell. As a progressive institution
that values diversity and social responsibility, we need
to take a stand and stop honoring tests that only per-
petuate the many economic and racial inequalities of
the American education system. I urge all students
and faculty to learn more about this important issue
and press Dean Sumner to develop a standardized
testing policy that reﬂects our core values.

Religious response to campusicartoon controversy

As a Muslim student, I would like
to address issue of the Danish cartoons
depicting Prophet Muhammad, peace
be upon him, and the controversy about

reprinting one of them in a Grinnell ,

publication. I strongly condemn these
cartoons and oppose the act of reprints
ing them because they inspire hatred
and misrepresent Prophet Mohammad.
Since people on campus have been dis-
cussing these cartoons tor a while, 1 will
try not to repeat issues that have been
already covered.

I do not agree with the claim that
the publication of these cartoons falls
under the principle of freedom of err
pressron. Rather, I believe it is an exam-
ple of the abuse or freedom of expres-
sion. It intended to associate Islam and
Muslims with terrorism at a time when
the whole world is engaged in ﬁghting
terrorism. These cartoons are offensive
and insulting for more than 1.9 billion
Muslim all around the words who con—
sider themselves as followers to Prophet
Mohammad.

In order to understand these Must
lims’ strong reaction, we must under»
stand the importance of Mohammad.
For Muslims, Mohammad is the perfect
man, the role model in our lives. Mos

hammad taught as moral and ethical
behavior. He encouraged Muslims to
love and help others. The life story of
Mohammad shows how he was suc-
cessﬁil in bringing peace and hope to
Arabia in only 23 years. uniting all the
people ofArahia. Also, he gave freedom
and protection to nunorrtres and weak
people.

As a young Muslim, I feel a personal
kinship with Prophet Mohammad,
peace be upon hrm.]ust like most other
Muslims,l feel that Mohammad is the
dearest to my heart, even more than
myself and my parents. For more mr
formation about Prophet Mohammad,
I would recommend this website: lmyrﬂ
urw‘w.mirrnclﬂrg/Mubammad/.

Despite my frustration with the car-
toon being reprinted in Grinnell in The
Salad magazine, I have tried my best to
explain to the editors why it was insenr
sitive and sacrilege to print it even if
their intention ms “to raise awareness."
I believe printing the cartoon was not a
constructive way to open a healthy dis
cussion about the issues. However,I be
lieve it is really worth mentioning here
that the editors of the salad were open
to listening to other people’s arguments
and concerns. i guess they did partially

correct their mistake by covering the
cartoon with a letter explaining their
position. I really appreciate their desire
to raise awareness about multicultural
issues and discrimination, even though
they were not considerate enough when
they decided to reprint the Danish Carr
toon.

Since members ofMuslim Student
Association learned from Prophet Mos
hammad the values of tolerance, under»
standing, and forgiveness, we accepted
the apology of The Saint! editors, and
were willing to move on with things and
cororganlze many events on our campus
with The Sal/id editors.

The final point I want to address is
the feature in the last issue of the SUB
under the title “Faculty panel discusses
ethics of political cartoons.”In this panel,
Professor Konstanty Gebert compared
the cartoon depicting Mohammad to
one of“Ariel Sharon eating Palestinian
children for breakfast.“ The 588 article
quoted lum as saying “It is a puzzle for
me that the same people, Muslims in
Europe, expect outrage at insults against
them, but keep quite where insults are
committed in their name."

My answer to his puzzlement is
that l as a Muslim will be deeply upr

set and offended by any targets of insult
to Judaism or any other religion. I will
protest these insults being committed
in the name of Islam. However, the cars
toon ofSharon is political, not religious.
I believe that Sharon has no religious
or sacred status among Jewish people.
Furthermore, as an amateur human-
nghts activist. I can argue that Sharon
is responsible for many humanrrights
vrolatrons that justify this exaggerated
cartoon. 1 do not want to go deep into
a political argument, given the length of
this article, hilt, in short, if we examine
the UN. records or the Human Rights
Watch records, we find evidence about
his violations that inspired such a cat-
toon. I hope this is clear to Professor
Gebert and to anybody who read the
last article.

In conclusion, 1 oppose die publi-
cation of the cartoons depicting Mor
hammad because they are offensive and
might lead to hate and discrimination
against Muslims. I am more interested
in promoting tolerance and understand-
ing. In sum,I do not believe in the clzlsh
ofcivillzatron; I believe more in the cor
existence of civilizations.

alone.

Who’s got the pitchforks?

Every time I touch the editorial page of the stair,
my flesh bums as with the flames of Hell. I can feel
the insidious malice latent in their writing as it poi—
sons my mind and, yea, the very air around me, When
they make a bad analogy or, verily, dare to criticize
our most hallowed of traditions (even unto Mary B.
Jamesl), I know that their pens drip with the dark
piteh of malevolence, as do their evil hours.

It has become clear that the editorial staff is, in
truth, a league of foul demons who have taken roost
in the very soul ofGrinnell. As Grinnellians and De-
fenders of Virtue, we must root them out‘! Lift up
thy pitchforks‘l Yea, loft thy torches”! This menace
may not be left to foster longer.

Instead of-a random rant, I want to offer a ran-
dom thanks. Thank you to FM and everyone else
who has made campus look so beautiful these List
few weeks, How lucky we are to have such wonder»
ful people making sure that notonly are our open
spaces well-taken care of, but also that there are gor-
geous ﬂowers everywhere we turn. It’s really a nice
gesture to accompany outlast few (stressful) weeks
here. And they do it all with a smile on their face.
So, thank you, thankyou, thank you! .
