The glorious secret revealed

Viv, cont. from pg. 9

She takes her place at the other end ofthc counter,
completely unaware of my wirchtul gaze. Ycr oddly
enough. Vivcrly fails to order any MiiidrRirc deliciir

After just a few minutes she leaves empty handed.
As I wnrch after her, bewildered, r circh a glimpse of

just moments ago. As I bend to pick up the wayward
napkin,I sec that it is covered In hci franric scinwls:

Saturday or Sunday. 1 rush inside, convinced I will
find Vivcrly in this Den of sccrcrs.

Greeting me at the door is the same suspicious
curator from my last visit. But this time, he’s wearing
a fireman’s hat. Finally I catch on. My octogenarian
nemesis has cunningly devised a makeshift scavenger
bunr, lending me to every place we've ever met.

Before the curator has a chance to remind me I've
been banned from the museum,l clash off to the Ea-

they want us out others, so they can keep these Jewels

Re: Admission core values

During my time here,'l have really conic to appre-
ciate Grinnell’s liberal education and the diverse srus
dent hody. However, when someone keeps harping
about the need to incorporate more diversity in ad-
missions process, just for the heck ofit, ii ticks me off.
Yeah, honoring standardized rcsrs may in some wiy
help ro perpetuate the economic and mini inequatir
tics of the American education system. But should
n small Liberal arts collck in rhe middlc ctlowa try
and uproot every soc' lnequal' iiihcrcnr in the
cducnriomii system? My .uisweri Grinnell rr s and
is ironcingiy diverse for a small college in rural Muir
west. I would be thrilled to know what “it standard-
izcd testing policy reﬂc‘ﬂmg our core value" would be
like. Ir'ynu made more effort to enjoy Grinnell’s exist-
ing diversity rather than making banal arguments, it
would save me the pain of writing a random rant in
142 words.
