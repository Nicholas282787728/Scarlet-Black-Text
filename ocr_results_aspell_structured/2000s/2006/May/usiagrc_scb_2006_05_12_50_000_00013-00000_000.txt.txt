Letters to th Edltor

Moy l2, 2006

[newspapr] / Box v—s

The progresswes are still here

on Monday evening, Dr. linadi Moustaplra, Sy i ambassador
to the US give a talk in South Lounge titled “Sy 1: Challenges
and Criscs,"r'ight here in old, liberal Grinnell College. “Liberal,"of
course. in modern word usage, ynonymous with the word “pro-
gicsshrc.“

Why then,did I : c a lcttci'to the editor in last week's Sfjlr‘ titled
“thrc are all the progressives now?" written by a current faculty
membet, and questioning why the syi ian ambassador was welcome
at 011mm”.

The author hi‘ lighted the irony ofthc fact that Jewish nroney
was funding thc visit oftlris gentleman, hut corrld not fund that of
an Israeli ofﬁcial or diplomat to visit the college She proclaimed
that this vrslt would prompt us to ignore Syria's poor human rights
record and overlook its military intervention in Lebanon, as well as
the lack ofa'pcace treaty with Israel,

These iii-grimcnrs that may be v. lbrrr seem to convey a striking
similarity to US foreign policy, that of cl loscd ears and closed
minds 1 think it is tr great opportunity that the Rosenﬁcld Program
has provided us by bringing a higl‘rianlmlg syrian official to visit
this campus and enlighten us with his point ofvicw lfsrurlcnts ind
facrrlty have reservations about different issues that Syria is or has
been involved with, then this rs their golden opportunity to question
an ofﬁcial who is accountable for answering these questions to the
American public.

One would want to have civilized discourse with this individual,
address concerns on various issues and exchange viewpoints such
that we are aware ofthe other side ofthe debate. After all, isn’t that
whar being progressive is all about? it is hearing every side of the
story openrmindedly, giving each a level playing field and then make

. there is open dialogue and frcc eve-hair

ing a ratronaljutlgment based on that information.
Alnartya Sen, r Nobel lall' 1n: philosopher and economist,
ii response to Samuel Huntingtons
morbid prediction of war between two starkly different cultures
(“The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking ofVVnrld Order”).

Sen argues that conflict in this case is usually prevented rvlren
ofidcas such that the two
distlnct c ions don't clash but ins rd merge, with‘each lncoi~
pointing aspects of the other in its own cultural blend,

1 agree with this viewpoint and l hclicvc that with last wcck’s
letter to the editor we have witne ed a bias at Grinnell, one Similar
to that prcr rlcnt amongst the niajo ty of the U S population. This
bias is no other than that ofinsensrtrvrty to rnytliiirg Arabic

This “Arab phobia , as Thomas Friedmur describes it, in the
U. S has led to other contcntinus issues in the past, like the Dubai
ports deal or even the Iraq war, to an cxl’cni.

The reincdy for this pro item on campus would be welcoming
Dr Moristapha and not yelling at him or vocallv opposing his visit.
We dont want to completely isolate ourselves from the Middle East,
nor do we want to make blind, biased judgments in the absence of
our own original thinking.

50 I would conclude that it would be beneficral to our Grinnell
education ifwe were to digest cvcry outlook on an issue, use our own
faculty ofrational thinking and then make a judgment. It wouldn't
matter what the judgment is, but that the judgment is fair and M,
curate,

I trust Grinnellians to be well endowed in this capacity. Thus, all
you need to do is give them a chance.

Ambassador promotes dialogue

i would like to share my opinion regarding the Syrian Ambasr
sador, Dr. Imad Moustapha, visit to Grinnell. It was my great plea—
surc that he kindly accepted the Roscnficld programs invitation to
Grinnell to give a speech about Syria.

It is the first time ever we have a Syrian diplomat in Grinnell,
just as I was the first Syrian ever to attend Grinnell.

In his specch,Anibnssador Moustaphn addressed the challenges
and crisis racing Syria. He talked about peace in the Middle East
and how it might be achievable. He said that “I am here with a
constructive message for peace.”

He stated that it is in the best national interests ofSyria to help
stabilize Iraq. He tiso stated that Syria wants peace with Israel. He

encouraged Americans to take an effective role in supporting the
peace process.

For Ambassador Morrstapha, peace means ending the conﬂict
with dignity He really provided a rich pcrspcctive about the Middle
East,

I really want to thank Professor Moyer for his great efforts, and
also Ambassador Mustapha for his presence with us. i am really
glad that we had the chance to hear a new perspective in our cam-
pus, and open more healthy dialogue about the Middle East. 1 hope
I was able to contribute something to this great institute before I go
home to Syria in few days.

“Oh no, you dont want to do that."

Surely he must have heard mcwrong lrcpcar myscli,ir bitloiid-
er this time.“No,I really think I'd like to stick around Grinnell after
graduation."

A nervous chuckle escapes his lips.

“No, no, I don't think you understand.
Grinnell smdentsdon’t stay here. See,
what happens is, we bring you in here
for four years,yoir do your little liberal
thing on campus, and then you move to
Chicago to work in investment banking.
That’s the deal."

Ibegin to sense something amiss. otcoursc I've been hearing
this sort ofrespoiise a lot latcly, but one would think that the Mayor
ofGrinnell would be at least Somewhat supportive.

“Umm, am I in the right office? They told me this was the

“Look, ifyou know whats goocl for you you ll get yourselfout of
this town as soon as possible. Go!"

I stumblc my way our of his Office and sluinp down to the floor
in a stare ofshoclc. Why is the city wow
eminent so determined to be rid ofD me?
Ofus? What are they hiding? There’s
only one person who can answer these
questions. And i know just where to find
her.

I head straight to the counter of
Maid-Rite to wait her out. Three hours
and five milkshakes later, Vivcrly finally shuffles in. I bury my face
in a handful of loose meat sandwich, praying she doesn't see me.
