Kery bake in Iowa to criticize war

Last Saturday Senator John Kerry
(DMA) gave a speech in a packed
Harris Centerr Kerry criticized the
Bush administration's Iraq policy and
praised dissenters as “patriotic.” After
the speech, Kerry spoke to the seals.

My pullout is to

tion where you have
a certain number of
troops there for our
interests, but not in
direct harm’s way...

We have nine
months to deal with
the insurgency The
insurgency is not militnry, it’s political.
You have to work the politics ofit. If
you don't deal with the politics in that
period of time, how are you gonna deal
with it? If they want to have a civil war,
they're going to have it. If they want
to have a democracy, they can have it.
But our troops can't get caught In the
middle of it.

I think that they ought to encoura

of behavior.

I think that I would be prepared

that a number of years agoiso that if

it goes down you stay
at a certain level. But
[wouldn't look to the
gasoline as the way
to deal with what we
need to deal with.
What we need to
[do] is provide strong
incentives for other
kinds of behavior.
We have to look at
strong incentives for
instance, to get hybrid cars out there. If
you have biofuel plus hybrid, you can
get 500 miles to the gallon.

I think that sometime in the fall we

Opinions divided
Ambassador, cont. from p. 2
arguing that he had been interrupted.

Moyer cut them both off after sevelal seconds.
“Would you be quiet so we can proceed?" he asked.

After the exchange subsided, Moustapha defende
ed Syria’s record on women's rights for several mine
utes before bringing the conversation back to where
it began. “I feltiptobably I was wrong—that you
wanted to read a political statement,” he said. “I-Iav-
llig said this, please admit that it was you who iutcn
iupted me.” This smrcmcnl was greeted by laughter
and scatter-ed applause, after which Monstapha took
the next question.

Opinions were shillply divided over the Moustar
phn's visit. thel-Azoulny, who wrote a letter to the
3631? last week criticizing Moustapha’s Invitrltlon,'said
that he hadn't shown respect. “As soon as [Ashkenazi]
started to ask the question, he interrupted her and
trivialized it," Gibel-Azoulay said. “Frankly, if it had
been Nelson Mandela who had treated a student that
way/,1 would have stood up."

Ahmed Ali ’06, who asked two questions to Mon»
staphn, was more positive. “The ambassadors talk
wasn’t just repeating what's being said by the Syrian
government,"Ali said, “The audience’s reaction wasn’t
very good to that, they y'ustwanted to attackhlm.Thete
were some
people who
already had
presupposed
ideas about
Syria and
came to attack
the country"

For Ashe
kenazai, a big
issue was the
onersided nature of the presentation. “A diplomat has
limits to what he or she can say because they are the
formal representative of their country,” she said. “I
wish that there had been another perspective accomr
panying the event. People who don't know anything
about Syria can really come out ofthis talk thinking
in a very one—sided manner."

In past years, the Rosennrld Program has spon-
sored Israeli and Palestinian speakers to for symptr
siurns. According to Moyer, Moustapha was the ﬁrst
Syrian speaker to visit Campus

“My own sense is that Glinnell students are smart
enough and analytical enough to judge what to lake
from each speaker," Moyer said. "Even from people
they don't agree with. People could have come out of
the meeting nppnlled by what he had said, but 1 think
there would be better oﬂr to hear it, and they would

”There were some peep/e who
already hadpresupposed ideas
about Syria and tame to mark
the country.”

‘ have a better sense or syrir having heard it even it

they disagrcc with it,"

Moustapha’s visit was arranged by Fardous Bal‘k
bouh ’06, a Syrian student who interned with Mou-
staplia during her Grinnell-in»Washington semester
According to Bahbouh, Mousttpha did not receive
compensation for his visit. “He left his [ofﬁce in
Washington], and we should really appreciate his
coming,” Bahbough said. “It was a good chance to see
the other perspective."
