BY PATRICK RITTER '

More than a decade ago, a kin-
dergartner would print words on a
bright pink sticky note. Many were
missing vowels, and few formed
complete sentences She took them
home and posted them around her
room.

Now, Amanda Got‘era ’09 some-
times wakes up in rhe middle of rhe
night and sits in front of a compute
or screen in her dorm. Her ﬁngers
dance across the keyboard. She says
she can barely control them as they
rype enough words to fill a hundred
stickyrnotes.

“l’m madly in love with it,” she
said of he: nocturnal habit of creative
writing.

“Writing is how I become
more than what I am,” she wrote in
a scholarship packet last year. She
won, becoming one of ﬁve students
nationwide to take home the highest
award in the writing section of the
Scholastic Art EcWriting’ Awards.

She did an interview on NPR last
spring in which she read one or her
poems. She was featured in the De:
Maine: Regittrr and appeared on rhe
Grinnell College website, all before
she took her ﬁrst class in college.

Despite the accolades, Goreru
maintains that she writes mostly for
herself.

becomes a piece ofart."

One such piece is “Circulation,"il
poem that expresses frustration. De-
scribing her body's reactions to her
emotions, the poem has a visceral 51,
cmcnt common to Gotera’s poetry,

In “Mitosis," another poem with
a corporeal theme, Gotera draws
connections between organic cycles,
feminine relationships and concepe
tious of the self.

"I wanted to comment on ottr
culture's attitude toward the com—
ing-or-nge and to the elderly, maybe
to sexuality," Gotcra said. “There’s a
sort ofm'trroring that goes on in na-
ture, and in this poem 1wanred ro
express our own mirroring, our own
passing on of tradition and identity.”

Gotera’s father, a professor at
the University or Northern Iowa,
has published a book of his poetry,
Gotcra has dreams ofequal success.

“I fantasize about getting a book
published with my name on rhe cov-
er,” she said, “But this whole writing
thing, while intrinsically tied up in
the product will go nowhere ifI
care more {or said product rhan for
the process itself."

Gotera said that the process of
writing can be intimidating, but she
encourages writers to not he so criti-
cal of themselves that they “become
immobilized.”

“You have to be willing to accept
that while you don’t know every»
thing, you have something relevant

 

 

Incarcerated in the classroom

Prison Writing Workshop educates prisoners and provides a medium for expression
av COLIN REYNOLDS

Last year in Quad Dining Hall, Emily Guenthet ‘08 hurriedly
finished her lunch,rose and announced that she was going to prison,
She had'not committed a crime, not zln inﬂammatory act of civil
disobedience, as her friends had thought, As a member ofthe Prison
Writing VVorkshup, she raughr a group of prisoners, hauurcd by rhen
experiences behind bars and their unrealized hopes on the outside,

“They have nothing but time," Katherine Rochester '06 said
of her students, inmates at the male Newton Correctional Facility.
“They’re thinking consranrly, and everyone's n philosopher."

Gnunell srndcnrs who participate in “Prison Writers" touch
classes to inmates at the prison as part of Grintiell's Prison Writing
Workshop. Mostly females, the
group teaches a class or around
eight to 12 prisoners every
weekday.

Howard Btllkle, Philosophy
and Religious Studies, started
the program several years ago.

Initially, Laura Matter '05 and

Ursula Hill ’05 became involved

through the Chaplain's ofﬁce, and Prison Writers bccamc an ofﬁcial
srudonr group during rhc 200372004 academic year, According ro
Rochester, the writing class was originally designed as a “restorative
justice“ program for both perpetrators of crimes and their victims.
It was meant to he :i cathartic experience for both parties. Now,
student volunteers take a different approach. “These are not rhcrilpy
sessions," said Rochester. “They're more abour coming in from the
outside and giving these guys a chance at creative expression."

Emily Gucnthcr ’08 reaches a ﬁction-writing course. “There's
a class component for about an hour and ‘ii half each week, iind I
sometimes do individual conferences as well,” she said. Though
the program began simply as a writing class under Burkle, the title

“Prison Writers" is now rather deceptive. “There are other classes,
too, like Philosophy and All," said Guenther. “Lust semester there
were seven alrogcrhcr." According ro Rochester, there are plilns this
semester for i\ theater class complete With the production ofa pluy.

Many student teachers agree that the inmates were eager to
learn. “I thinlt I have the most cnthlls stic group ofstlldcnts I could
have in any serr.ug,"sairi Gllcntllcr,

Katie Jiros '07 agreed. “Prison is a habir rhar gets unrlor your
slein,"she said “Once you stair working them, ir's hard to woilr any-
wheic else.”

“in (llc wriring classes, you really got ro know the guys," said
Rochester. “They're writing about
thc kids they haven’t seen, about

x the meaning orlirc and rhcrr olvn
lives in particular, Out: of i'hc wrik

The classes orrered through Prison Writers are completely vol—
