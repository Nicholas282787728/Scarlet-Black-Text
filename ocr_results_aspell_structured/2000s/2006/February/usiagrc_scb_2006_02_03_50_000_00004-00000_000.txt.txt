Kung fu kings, queens and landlords mums

This weekend, enjoy cartoonish martial artists, musical musings and French cinema par excellence

Kung Fu Hustle (R

Stephen Chow‘s Kung Fl! Hurt/i doesn't take itself
seriously, but perhaps that's what makes it so chaim»
lag. Chase sequences, during which legs become a
him at speed reminiscent of the famed Road Run-
ner ofLeeney Train, and dancing, rtxe swinging, tops
hat wearing villains onlyhint at the movies cinematic
absurdity and cartoonish characteiization. In order to
accept this story, to buy into the world Chow asks us
to enter, we must totally abandon conventional pliyse
ics and, for that matter, conventional character devel—
opinent.

The tale itself is as much a story of two communie
ties as it is of the protagonist Sing, played by Chow,
who also wrote the film. The plot concerns the two
communities and their battles: the hierarchical and
powerehungry Axe Gang and the intimate, humble
and empathyeﬁlled hamlet ofPig s .

Sing and his friend Bone pick on hapless barbers
and villagers in Pig Sty, all the while pretending to
be part of the notorious Axe Gang. Their thuggish
behavior is foiled by a “hidden master" (a must for any
kung-fu movie, or satire). In fact, graceful martial arts
talent overwhelms the quaint locale. The masters in-
clude such unexpected figures as a surly, chainesmeke
ing landlady who brandishes a frying pan with the
same grace Bruce Lee wields his nunchuks.

Adding to the satiric nature of this film, the most
formidable, villainous master, known only as “The
Beast,” has all the visually intimidating presence of an
accountant. Sing discovers the world of these hidden
masters, and caught between the power of the goods
hearted masters of PigeSty and the mercenary masters
of the axe gang,‘hc is forced to re-cvaluatc his own
history and life.

Sing, who at first seems to be little more than a
thug, has an cxcting back story which we learn through
ﬂashback. He eventually joins the more moral com-
munity, the “good guys," and their struggle culminates
in exciting, visually unique and cinematlcallyeengage
ing fight sequences. It isn’t a terribly profound story,
but quite a seductive one. Chow creates a world of
surreal images, and ifwe accept this zaniness, the sims
pie satiric charm of the story emerges

Rent (PG

Story adaptations from one medium to another
always make for tricky transitions. For Rem, the hit
Broadway pep-rock musical about the “Bohemians"
and HIV»posltive of New York's East Village, reace
(ion has been varied. Broadway dieshards insist that
the film doesn’t live up to expectations. New viewers
seem to wonder what all the hiss is about. But for
others, like me, it simply gets the job done the best
way it can.

Ridiculous f ghi mm betwcm mm gangs/i m diﬂrrcrzt lawn: rim/14' up mart 0/502th Chan/r Kung Fu Hustle.

Beginning on Christmas Eve, 1989, Rent is the
story of broke roommates Mark and Roger whose
rent is due to their landlord and former friend Benny.
Benny wants to buy up the lot and turn i into a cor-
porate cyber studio, and Mark, Roger and their ncighe
bots are not too happy about in One such neighbor,
Mimi (Rosario Dawson), a heroin ddicted exotic
dancer, takes an interest in Roger,who i tially refuses
her advances.Their chemistry crackles as the two turn
out to have more in common.Their relationship is the
focal point of the film and has several musical num-
bers dedicated to it.

Make no mistake, Rent is entirely an ensemble film.
It is essentially a story of friends, some infected with
HIV, others protesting gentrification and some empa-
theticallyrememberingpastrelationships Despitethe
daily conﬂict, traumaand fear they encounter, the films
message to live life to the fullest and love generously
is clear without becoming saccharine or schmaltzy.

However, while the message is heartfelt, a few
things get bungled in the execution. For example, the
writers seem to be worried we’ll miss the film’s topic.
The word “AIDS” is used far more frequently in the
film than in the Broadway show. The distrust of film
audiences continues when the stage production’s opv
eraric style gives way to regular dialogue and a hand—
ﬁil of songs aie cut. But the Real-head in me wants to
believe that the intent is to preserve as many old fans
and gain as many new fans as possible, maint ‘iiing a
shaky balance between the two.

Director Chris Columbus, also known for his
work with the ﬁrst two Hany Pa/ter adaptations,
should be credited for keeping most of the original
cast, aSlde from Dawson and Tracie Thoms, whose
parts‘ original actresses declined to play. The cast is
solid and fairly adept at scaling down their thctltris
cal performances, despite a few missteps.The musical
numbers serve a story-telling purpose and often use
montages to explain back story in a way the stage pi'O‘
duction could not, “One Song Glory" shows the de
tails ofRogcr’s past addiction and acquisition ofHIV
through a suicidal girlfriend, details that are more vi-
sually appealing than the briefdialogue in the show,

Similarly, “Out Tonight,"Mirni's song, revs us up for
another plea to Roger as we get a glimpse ofher world
as an exotic dancer. At the end of the title track, the
residents of the Village ignite their eviction notices
and toss them into the air in a digital conﬂagration
that would have been impossible onstage and even on
film a decade ago.

Ultimately, Reti/ questions the best way to meat
51er quality oflife. The film also asks its loyal fans to
take the story as it is, no matter what form it takes.

Kings and Queen nruted}

In Plato's world of forms, Arnaud Desplechin’s
Kizigr mid Queen would sit beside truth, love and
beauty as the idealized “150»minutc-long French
film,"lt is an amazing example ofthe artofEuropean
filmmaking, but a film of this length and type may be
engaging to only select audiences.

The story is split into two interrelated parts. The
first storyline tells of the strikingly beautiful Nora, a
single mother caring for her father, who suffers from
a devastating illness.The other storyline focuses on a
scruffy violist named Ismael who has been forcefully
admitted to a psych ward.There are several major plot
twists and one in particular that will shatter nearly all
the viewer’s pievious conceptions.

Our perceptions of truth are a major theme of the
ﬁlm and perhaps the most important to the director.
Dcsplcchin uses these perceptions to manipulate the
tiuth. His characters'peisonalitics are manipulative as
well, and we only gain a full understanding of these
individuals at the end of the film. At moments like
these, we realize the film's artistry

Not many modern films can have such an effect
on its viewers. That being said, the film is made for
insatiable film lovers, undaunted by the movie's length
and Desplechin's nearly pretentious yer masterful die
iection, and may be inaccessible to others.
