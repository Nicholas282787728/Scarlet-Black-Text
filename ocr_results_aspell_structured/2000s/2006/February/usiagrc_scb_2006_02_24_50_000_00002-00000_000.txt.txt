”9%; This Week in Joint Board

President Russell K. Osgood said Trustees will vote to au-
thorize plans to renovate Cowles as alternative housing this
Friday. Osgood said that there will be at least one more alternar
tive housing project in the future. He said the trustees will also
discuss the endowment, half of which is now up for reinvest-
ment, an unusually high amount.

Osgood said Grinnell will eventually build windmills as
an alternative energy source, buthe is not sure when the project
will take place. -

Several resolutions were introduced addressing wind power,
the creation of a campus pub and extension of hours for the
Athletic and Fitness Center.

There was some debate over the Campus Republicans’ re-
quest for funds to attend the Iowa Federation of College Res
publicans State Convention, owing to the SGA precedent of
not ﬁlnding partisan groups. The board voted to pay for their
hotel and gas, but not the convention’s participation fee.

Student “had big plans”

Rose-Palermo, cont. from p. 1

After transferring at the end of 2004, RoserPalermO re-
turned to his home state of Arizona and spent time with his
mother in San Diego and planned to eventually travel the
world playing poker. He worked {or a time at a pizza parlor in
Mesa, Arizona before enrolling at Arizona State in fall 2005 in
order to finish a degree in architectural studies.

Even after leaving his pursuit of philosophy, friends re-
membered Rose-Palermo for his thoughtfulness and long con—
Versations.

Lake recalls a visit last year to RosevPalermo in Arizona
over spring break. “He still had big plans," Lake recalled. “We
stayed up that night making toasts in all the languages we knew,
until we couldn't stand up."

“I will miss conversations till three in the morning over top—
ics ranging from the kind of fathers we hoped to become, to
how often we should wash our socks," said Elliot. “john was an
acquired taste well worth the time and effort."

Rose-Palermo was buried on Monday in his parents'horne-
town in Arizona following a service at Mount Carmel Catholic

Church,

Longtime trustee dies

Gardiner Dutton ’53 suffered a cere-
bral hemorrhage Sunday in Arizona

When the Board of Trustees gathers this weekend at the
Old Glove Factory, one familiar face will be missing. Gardiner
Dutton ’53, a trustee of the college since 1970, passed amy
Sunday in Arizona.

Trustee Fred Little ‘53 was Dutton's roommate for three
years at Grinneu and has stayed in Contact with Dutton.

"It was a real shock to me,” Little said. “We were so close."
The two had attendedHarvard graduate school together after
Grinnell, Dutton for business and Little for law, and over the
subsequent years close ties had developed between their {amir
lies as well.

“Gardiner was a skinny little redheaded kid," said Littl .
"Enormously talented. studies came enormously easily to him."
Dutton graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Grinnell and was a
Baker scholar to Harvard Business School, where he graduated
second in his class.

Others came to know his intellect. Professor Emeritus Wale
do Walker, Biology, met Dutton in the 1970s while Walker was
Executive Vice President of the college.

“He was a very sharp and intelligent fellow,”Walker said.
“He had a very good business mind."

For many the best example of that sharpness was Dutton’s
role overseeing the college’s investment in a television station
in Dayton, Ohio.

"[The purchase] was Warren [Buffetls idea, but Gardiner
did the heavy lifting," said Little. “Gardiner was a very busy
executive at the time, and he came out several times a month" to
oversee the station. uWc purchased the station for 813 million,
and sold it for $49 million. The endowment was only $20730
million at the time, so that was huge.”

Walker echoed that praise. “Taking over the station, the
trustees had to have someone who was responsible to run it," he
said. “That was Gardiner."

Little and Burton has been connected even before they
met. Dutton was the ﬁrst recipient of a scholarship in the name
of Little's father, also a graduate ofthe school.

"He always used to joke that he didn’t get enough money,"
recalled Little.

AWWE superstar (professional wrestler) by the
name of Randy Orton (http://wwwwwecom/SU-
perstars/smackdown/randyorton/) calls his fin-
ishing maneuver the RKO (as a spoof off of total
knock outmrandy knock out). Since he‘s using your
initials, how do you plan to retaliate?
——Submirtzd by Wer Barber '05
I don’t know anything about this and don’t intend to find
out. I don’t believe in retaliation in lifeThe initials RKO were
used by a movie chain when l was younger, so I've seen it before.
I even have heard oranother person named Russell K. Osgood.
Pro wrestling doesn't interest me.
