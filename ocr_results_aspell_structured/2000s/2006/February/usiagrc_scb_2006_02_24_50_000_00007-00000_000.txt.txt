FQR NOT SMOKING

Younker Pit to be

smoking lounge

While students on South Campus
have been able to go to Cleveland lounge
to smoke (or over a year now. Not th
Campus smokers have been going without
tltcir plomiscd smoking lounge. That will
change over the summer, when the cur-
rent KDlC studio in Younker Pit will bc
couvcrlcd into a smoking loungc,

The dcbatc over a North Campus
smoking lounge has been playing our in
Joint Boald and on student life commit-
tees for two years. A
campusrwidc smoking
ban went into effect in
2004, and admimstrm
tors decided to pick
one lounge on South
and North Campuses
for smoking.

‘ “Wheitwc wentto
[asmokc-freccitmpus]
Tom [crndy] said we'd have two smoking
lounges. one on North campus and one
on South Campus,' said Jennifer Krohn
dean for Student Life While Cleveland
residents came forward and asked that
the South Campus smoking area be in
their lounge, no such representatives came
forward trom North campus.

While almost everyone wanted a
smoking lounge on North Campus to keep
smokers out ofloggias and non-smoking
lounges, many North Campus residents
wanted it to be away from where they
lived. Ventilation system difﬁculties also
corn plicatcd the system. Finally with
KDllC moving to the Joe Rosenﬁeld 25
Campus Center nextyctu, the Younker Pit
lounge was picked as the best location

According to SGA Prcsidcnt John
Bohman '06, the Younker Pit lounge was
a good location because of its separation
from the rest of the floor. “It would he
the least offensive to the people who lived
there," he said.

”l don’t particularly wan! to
live in a plate Where smoking is
rampant. . and encouraged”

Smounkcr Sc alor Mid Younker Pit
rcsrdcut Nora S , ’08 is not excrtcd
about these changes. “I don‘t particularly
want to live in a place whcrt: smoking is
iampan nd encouraged,"she said,

Skelly does not
think SGA should
reconsider its sup-
pott for the smoking
louilgef‘lt’s a decision
that’s already been
made." she said.

Krohn said East
Campus is not eligible
for a smoking lounge
due to its speciﬁc building regulations

According toJcnnifer Ki'oltn, dean for
Student Life, this will mean changes for
the Younker Pit lounge itself. The tempo—
l‘ary walls establishing the KDIC studio
will be removed to convert the area into
one large room. “I think wed probably put
a TV down thcrc. too," she said.

Bolunan shares Skelly's view that last
year's decision should be upheld. “It took
so much of SGA’s time last ycal. [We
decided to] just let the decision stand,”
he said,

Hildcbrand bclicvcs the smoking
lounge will also prevent smoking outside
ordesignated areas. “it could encourage
people not to smoke in their rooms,” she
said,

Boluuan shares these ltopcs. "I think
it'll contribute to the overall observance
of smoking rules," be said. “Self-gover—
nance only works to the extent that we
observe it."

Up in smoke

Cold temperatures drl‘ve smokers inside,
but this irks many students, staff

it BEN SCHRAGER

With temperatures in the low teens for much of this winter,
student smokers face a dilemmal'hey’re not supposed to be smok-
ing in buildings or loggias, but don‘t want to shiver in the cold
while putting away.

When smokers stay inside, though, they infuriatc many other ~
students who don’t like the smell and the health risks of second
hand smoke.

Ben Cohn '08. a norrsmoker, has been outspoken about stu—
dents smoking in loggias. “I've got asthma and it doesnt help
that," he said. “i think most people, especially the people who don't
smoke, would appreciate it
if rhcy didn't get covered
in [smoke] just walking
around."

While loggias, includ-
ing the open loggias on
North and Easr Campus,

zones, many smokers aren’t
aware of that limitation.
Others smoke anyway.

For Kyle Cranﬁll ’07,
the loggia seemed like one of the last places he had left to smoke.
“They’ve dtchn us out ofcvcrywhere elsc,"he said.

Ben chsack'08 said that he smokes in the loggia from time to
time. “lfI was smoking in an enclosed place, rather than one [with
a lot ofairﬂow],"thcn his critics might have a point, Lebsack said.
As it is, “the only complaint could be smell."

Nick Wilson ’09, a smoker since he was 14, said the smoking
restrictions on campus were “kind ota pain,"

East Campus RLC Billy Kennedy suggested self-governance
as the best way to moderate smoking. He encouragcd students to
ler other students know if rhey are being bothered.

chsadt said almost no one has said anything to him about
smoking in the loggia. “Sometimes people cough [noticeably] as
they walk by," he said.

Lebsack didn’t think that his smoking in the loggias went
against sclf»govcrnancc.“lf [students] aren't willing to say anything
to me.1 don't think [seliegovernance] applics."hc said.

Cohn agreed with this critiquei He's started an informal cams
pitign encouraging students to act on selfrgovernance and speak
out against everything from breaking campus bikes to smoking in
log ias. “’Im not taking a personal stance against anv one issue in
particular," Cohn said. “’Its the spirit ofsolving problems through
communication. ‘Cohn promoted the simple phrase“ cut that shit
out for students wanting to speak up

If people ﬁnd that phrase helpful, I encourage people to use
it, " Colin said
