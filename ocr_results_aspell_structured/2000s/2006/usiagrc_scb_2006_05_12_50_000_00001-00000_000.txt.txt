SGA year
in review

Bohman, Ochoa administration
widely seen as successful

BY MERRICK MEYERS

Last spring, John Bohman 'oo helped lead the large
student protest at a trustee meeting against a tuition
hike. By this past full, he was prcsidenr of SGA and
led an administration that has received widespread
praise for effective championing ofstudent interests.

His administration boasts several major accom»
plishments:

- increase in student wages was secured, with one
other one due next year

- Two offvcampus houses became slated for recov-
ety

Board the most effective in years. “This joint board
was smoking,” said Bohman.

Ochoa said the Board’s successes lay in “olfering a
conduit between students and the administration, not
just picking up issues and bringing them forward but
facilitating the ﬂow of information."

According to Bohman and Ochoa, one of their
biggest accomplishments was an increase in commu»
nication between the student body and the Board of
Trustees,with additional open forums for students to
voice their concerns and opinions to the Trustees.The
greatest challenge, they said, was keeping people mos
tivated and maintaining momentum.

The Joint Board, meeting as a whole for several
hours every Wednesday night and in many smaller
committees, discussed projects and resolutions on
topics ranging from printer maintenance to surveile
lance cameras to getting a roof over Ganesh. They
also allocated college funds to the many student
groups that requested them. Due to the large budget
at their disposal this year, rhcy were able to be gener-
ous with funds.

The one topic receiving the most discussion and
debate this semester was the proposed reform of the
Student Government Association. All agreed that
some aspects of SGA needed to be altered, but there
disagreements on what changes needed to be made.
The first and most sweeping plan, the “triumvrratc
proposal" championed by the president, called for,
among other changes, the creation of a second vice
president. This vice presidenr would have handled the
student affairs issues, allowing the presidenr to focus
on such matters as institutional planning. Part of the
rationale for this was rhe heavy workload taken on by
Bohman.

Later, a second proposal supported by the vice
president, would have created no new vice president
but made orhcr, lcss drastic changes to improve SGA.
Shortly after this second preposal was introduced, it
was concluded by the reform committee that no deci-

“patriotic” dissent

TOM BALDWIN

Police charge senior with break-in

5v EVA CoNsTANTARAS

On April 13 at 2:30 am. the Grinnell Police arrested Laura
Dobbs ’06 in the Forum Grill. Dobbs has been charged with one
count of burglary in the third degree, which is a Class D felony
punishable by up to five years in prison and/or a $7,500 fine. A trial
date has not yet been set.

Tom crady, vice president for Student Affairs conﬁrmed rhat
they are conducting an investigation into the breaktin and that po-
lice searchcd a students room the day of the breakein. According to
several key sources, Dobbs, who had been HSC for CND for the
last three years and an active member of the Grinnell community, is
also being investigated for theft ofkeys for several campus buildings,
including the Forum, and improper use ostc funds.

According to the complaint filed by Michael Sims, associate
dean for Srudcnt Life, couege security called the police afrer finding
a door to the Forum open and Dobbs crouched behind the counter
with an empty backpack. Dobbs was arrested and appeared for her
initial hearing. Local attorney Brad McCall, coach for the Grinnell
Mock Trial team ofwhich Dobbs was coepresident, is representing
hcr in courr. Dobbs did not respond to a request for in inrcrvicw
and McCall was unavailable for comment.

Dobbs, a Neuroscience major, was a member ofthe spring waltz
Committee, Election Board, Commencement Committee, Senior
Challenge and MockTrial. Shortly after the breakcin, Dobbs either
resigned or was removed from from these responsibilities as wcll
as her HSC duties, and moved off campus. She is still attending
classes and some campus events.

crady refused to discuss the investignrion, including whether
Dobbs will graduate this year. He said (hilt there is no standard pro—
cedure for handing such cases but that this late in the year, the case

would probably be handled by the College Hearing Board instead of
the Judicial Committec,which includes student members. Accord-
ing to Student Arrairs Policy, the college Hearing Board, which
consists of administration and faculty members appointed by the
president, has primary jurise
diction when a “student has
harassed or injured any col-
lege community member or.
by other conduct, has inter
rupted or interfered with any
college program or facility."

Crady said that punish-
ments range from warnings
to dismissals. “You don’t
want to have a cookie cutter approach to punishments,” he said. In
cases of theft, he said students are expected to replace stolen goods
and ifkeys are stolen, pay to have locks changed. Replacing locks for
several buildings may cost thousands of dollars.

Stephanie Masta, tlic RLC for CND who has worked with
Dobbs for the last four years, has been called as a witness for the
trial and therefore cannot discuss the speciﬁcs of the case. She said
Dobbs was an excellent HSC and “did a great job all three years,"
largely because of licr crearivity. Last year, Dobbs invited a vice prose
ident of the college over for dinner as a study break once in month.
“She is really good at reading what people wnnl and addressing peo—
ple’s necds,”Masta said. “She’s a WOO [Wins Others Over].”This
semester, Dobbs organized themed study breaks including magnet
making, neckwnrmor, pinata, therapy dog, Valentine’s cardemaking,
