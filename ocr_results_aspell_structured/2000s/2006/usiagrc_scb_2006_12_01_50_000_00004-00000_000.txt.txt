Never knowing what you're doing. No,
it's weird because the directing class mainly

Darct-latyom-p/ay.

 

It's about a man and n
wouwn. They don't have
names, My play is after
the fact. The woman had
a boyfriend and she started
an c-inail affair with a guy
that she'd met three years
previously and then went to
see him. And they had sex
and everything went wrong,

 

 

 

so she went home and her
boyfriend broke up with her.
But the story is being told

after all ofthis has happcncd and she's sort of
trying to work her way through it.

about shaping a

just consists of reading and
discussing articles by other

me because there are so many
divci-geut views on how you
should direct and its difficult
to sift thiough that and find
your own style and the way
that you work the best.

There's something fulﬁlling

Students broach taboo topics at Grinnell Monologues

The 5138 talked with Amanda Slams '07 and Stephanie Rosenbaum
'os, co—lcaders of this year’s Grinnell Monologues. The Monologues will
be performed tonight at 9 pm. and Saturday at 1 pm, in Loos: Lounge,

How long [law Mr Gl'imze/IMarw/oguer not going an?

AS: This is the third year.

SR: The idea is based on the Vagina melaguen but what we did was
decided to take the idea of the Vagina Monologue: and make itour own. So it’s
actually all written by the Grinnellians who are in it.

AS: Grinnell Monologues is a brainchild ofSarah Millhouse, who came

' to Feminist Action Coalition three years ago and said, “Listen, every year

Amanda Slatus ’07 and
Stephanie Rosenbaum ’08

" when we do the Vagina Monologue: we invite Grinnellians to writs their own

and we always get fantastic ones. I think we have enough interest to do a
show all ofour own and not even do Vagina Mona/ogwr And so she and a
few other people, including myself, created the Grinnell Monologmes out of
Feminist Action Coalition.

So is it still ablml mghmr?

SR: Some ofit. Not all ofir.

AS: The subject matter has certainly expanded. We’ve gotten monologues
about everything from body image to smelly vaginas to

SR: Gender identity, sexual orientation, fetishes

AS: Being awkward

SR: Dating at Grinnell Because it's such an open forum, you get so many
different responses to what we aim to talk about.

What day“; think maker (bi; 11min! for Grinnell?

SR: When you have a group of people that are willing to share their own
experiences about suit, sexuality body images. all ofthcse above topics, which
are sometimes taboo to talk about, which are sometimes very uncomfortable to
talk about. and you have these people that are being very honest about their own
experiences, it opens it up for other people to say what they think about it.
