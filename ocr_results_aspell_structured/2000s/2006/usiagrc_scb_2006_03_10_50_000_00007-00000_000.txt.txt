Quilting with the Jewel Box -

The Jewel Box Quilt Guild meet monthly to learn, show their work and arrange charity projects

BY EMlLlA CARVEV

On Thursday night at Saint Mary‘s Parish Center,
in a room reminiscent of an elementary school cafetet
ria,with round tables, plastic chairs and snacks to one
side, the Jewel Box (hilt Guild convenes. About 60
women come together to share, learn about and orga-
nize quilt-making projects.They talk group business,
committee plans, note who’s in the hospital and who’s
getting better. Out of shopping bags tucked under
their chairs, they pull out some quilts big enough for a
family ofﬁve and others as small as drink coasters.

The Jewel Box Qiilt Guild, named after Grin—
nell’s Louis Sullivan bank, is one of about 40 quilt
guilds in northeastern lowa, The women who are
a part of the Jewel Box Quilt Guild come together
every second Thursday of the month to share their
pieces, the many activities they participate in with the
guild's support and the colorful results.

“I think the guild brings lots of aspects of quilting
together," said Mary Hazelwood, an early childhood
special education teacher from Marshalltown and
an active guild member. “Members bring their ere
periences and, observations together and share them
among our group. Many of us use the same patterns
and techniques, but the results are unique to each 'm,
dividual."

The quilting guild has been an established com-
munity since 1995, but most women work on their
quilts on their own. Every woman has her own attit
tude toward her own work, and the monthly meetings
serve as a place for diverse opinions and experiences
to interact.

Katyjones, the guild's current president, has been
sewing all her life, but only came to quilting when
she rctired.“l knew I didn't have enough time to do it
before," she said “Then,when1started doing it, 1 got
mad, because it was such a great stress reliever.“

The women at February's meeting laughed in

agreement.

"Qttilting is therapeutic,"said Patsy Carr, a graphic
designer who lives in Grinnell and is presidenttelect
for next year.

“Except when it makes you cry,”added Janet Carl,
who works in the Grinnell College Writing Lab.

For the guild members, who often work at home
alone, the meetings function as a sounding board for
opinions on quilts in progress as well as help with
quilting techniques.

“There are a variety of quilting styles, even in this
group," said Mary Hazelwood. “Some people do res
ally traditional quilts, and others do really arty ones.
The guild brings everything together. lfyou're having
a problem with something, there’s always someone to
help you."

At each month's meeting, quilters display and dis-
cuss their works amidst the ClJCkS ofknitting needles.

After all the quilts are shown and complimented,
the monthly guild meetings endThey linger for a bit
of gossip and a few cookies, and the women trickle
out ofthe building.

“We've got people from all over," said Jones.
“Montezuma, Marshallrown. Gilmdn, Garwin, Kel-
logg, Newton, Pleasant Hill, Montour."

Though the guild members attend and plan
events outside of their monthly meetings, like an an—
nual quilting retreat and a biannual quilt fair, they
have recently found a place to branch out on a more
regular basis.

Fibcrworks, the new fabric store on Main Street
in Grinnell, has become like a second home to some
ofthemThe owners ofthe shop came to guild meets
ings a year before they opened the state to find out if
there would be enough interest for the store’s offer-
ings. Now, guild members teach classes at the shop
and have work displayed there. The guild supports
the store, and the store supports guild plojects by (107

nating fabric for charity quilts.

Many quilters find good homes for their pieces.
At the February meeting, guild members showed
quilts for newly married relatives and new babies.
one woman showed a quilt made out of rock concert
t»shirts and mice—ourmotorcycletpatterned fabric for
a son about to finish veterinary school. Quilts are of
ten madejust to be given away.

“I gave a quilt to my léryearsold grandson, and
I thought he might not care," said Jones, "But when
it wouldn't ﬁt in his suitcase and he refused to give it
back so I could mail it to him, I knew he liked it."

Family members and friends aren't the only ones .

who benefit from the guild’s quilts. The group has
made quilts for a variety ofcauses.

“Fabric is donated, and guild members piece the
quilts and assemble them together," said Margy Sieck,
the charity committee head and founding president of
the guild, The guild, through the charity committee,
has made baby quilts tor Birthright, children’s quilts
for the Department ofHuman Services and quilt pil-
lows for breast cancer patients.

Most recently, the group made quilts for the family
that was planning to move into the Gtinnell Habitat
for Humanity house. Although this family didn't end
up moving in, the children got their quilts for Christ-
mas. Next up, they'll be participating in the chrilts of
Valor project, which makes patriotic colored quilts for
injured veterans. “The joy of giving someone a home-
made quilt is great,"sitid Sieck.

The guild meets every month, bringing together
diverse quilting experiences, to learn from each other
and to organize giving quilts to others. The exchange
of information often encourages artistic expression.
“We like to do creative things,” said Sister Ladonnn
Woerdman,who came to the group in 2001 when she
moved to Grinnell. “The guild helps you to see one
side the box."

'Quilting is a method
of sewing or tying two
layers of cloth with a
layer of insulating bat~
ting in between.

-The process or making
a quilt involves three
steps: piecing, layering
and binding. Fleeing is
the sewing oi the quilt
top. Layering places the
quilt's backing, batting
and top in place.The
main function ofquilr-
ing is to hold the three
iayers together. Binding
eompletes the quilt by
finishing the edges with
a trim of fabric.

~The origins of this
method of cult are
thought to be in the
Crusades, when sol-
diers needed warmth
as weii as protec-
tion from the chaf-
ing caused by heavy
armour.
