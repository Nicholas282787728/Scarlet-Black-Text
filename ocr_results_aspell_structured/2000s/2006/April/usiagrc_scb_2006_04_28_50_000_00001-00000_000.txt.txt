Behind an RLC's resignation

Jamaland RLC Chuck Erickson steps down after a sexual harrassment complaint

xv Jost SEGEBRE—SALAZAR

Over spring break, Jamaland residents received an email from
Director of Residence Life Sheree Andrews informing them that
their RLC Chuck Erickson had gone on leave. No explanation was
offered, and some students were concerned.

Lindsay Helmrlch ’09, aJamaland resident, feared he was ill or
had an accident. She also said that Student Affairs should have at
least said he was safe.

“Nobody said anything," Helmrich said. "They just said he’s
gone on leave, at ﬁrst l was like, ‘Oh my God, is he okay?”

Erickson had not simply gone on leave. He had been placed on
leave. on Thursday, April 13, after a meeting with President Russell
K. Osgood, Erickson resigned.

Federal law and college policy mandate conﬁdentiality by colt

lege administrators on issues dealing with personnel and students.
Erickson, Osgood, Andrews and Vice President for Student Aﬁ’airs
Tom Crady all declined to comment on specifics. students involved
in those disputes are under no obligation to maintain conﬁdentialt
r .
[y The process that led to
Erickson’s removal began
in November when Jnmlth
and HSC Becca Weinel ’08
complained to Andrews that
she felt uncomfortable near
Erickson. Werner would not
discuss the exact nature of
the alleged harassment, say-
ing it would just perpetuate
the harassment. According
to Weiner, Andrews saw it as a bnundnry issue, told hel Erickson
did not fully know his role as an RLC, and said that she would speak
with Erickson.

\Vcincr said she expressed her concerns to Erickson. She said she

”Nobody sold anything. They
yuslsnld [Erickson had] gone on
leave. Al ﬁrsll was like, ’Oh my
God, is he okay?”

Lindsay Helmrith ’09

told Erickson things like “that's so inapproprrate," and "that makes
me uncomfortable."Weiner said that she felt so uncomfortable with
Erickson that for several months she didn’t fulﬁll her duties as an
HSC, which often required personal contact with Erickson. Ma»
terials for study breaks were contained in a cabinet in Erickson’s
apartment.

When her relationship with Erickson failed to improve, Weiner
sought advice from Clangrila RLC LeAnne]ones.]oncs advised her
to talk to Crady, who told her that in order for an investigation to
take place,Weiner had to file a formal statement. Shortly after win-
ter break, Weiner filed the complaint and Human Resources started
an investigation,

Crndy would not conﬁrm
whether or not these events
occurred, but said that it is
Human Resources respon-
sibility to investigate com,
plaints against staff mem~
bets.

The Human Resources
investigation found Erickson grrilty, and he was placed on leave. He
was initially allowed to stay in his apartment on campus, but then
was placed in collegetuwned housing orracampus. and was banned
from campus and internctrng wrth students. Erickson appealed the
decision but resigned hernre the appeal could be heard.

Dcspirc the conﬁdentiality promised, weiner said she fclt the
need to talk because she salt Student Affairs needed to be less sc-
cretive. “The snrdent population has a right to know exactly what
huppcncd,"WcIner said.“SmdentAffnlts needs to be transparent. If
they won't, I will be."

some students who know Erickson pointed to n lick ofexpcri-
once on all sides.

”The sludenl population has
a right to know exntlly what
happened”

Primary elections
today in Forum

By DAVID MONTGOMERV

When Erin Hennessy ’09 and other Poverty Ac-
tion Now volunteers arrived at the plot of land that_
they'd be helping to garden, they were met by a man
who introduced himself as “Ed." “He was telling us
where to put stuff and what our next assignment was,"
said Hennessy. “He had to leave us before lunch be»
cause he had to go to a ‘Food Not Bombs' rauy. We
thought that was really cool." It was only when Hens
nessy was leaving that she found out that “Ed” was
actually State Rep. Ed Fallon, a Democratic candidate
for governor.

Last Saturday, Fallon met with several dozen stut
dents in the Forum South Lounge.The next day one
of Fallon‘s opponents, former state Director of Eco-
nomic Development Mike Blouin, also visited cams
pus and talked with six students in Loose Lounge.
The third major candidate, Iowa Secretary of State
Chester “Chet" Culver, is on campus today. Grinncll
is a focus of Iowa political activity because the F0,
rum South Lounge today is a satellite voting location
where citizens can cast early ballots for the June 6 pri-
mary. Voting is open from 9 am to 4 p.m.

Iowa law allows voters to register up to 10 days
before an election, and so those who are not regist
tered Iowa voters can register today in the Forum
with proper identiﬁcation. The primary is a closed
primary, so voters must register a party afﬁliation in
older to vote in that party’s primary.

Rep. Jim Nussle (R-lA) is running unopposed in
the Republican contest for governor. Other Demo-
cratic candidates include Sioux City engineer Sal
Mohamed and Wallingford mayor Mark Yackle.

The three principal Democrats agree on many is-
sues, including the limiting the role of money in poli-
rics. “It's just godsawful the money you've got to spend
in politics these days," Blouin said, echoing a call by
Fallon for a “Clean Elections" bill. Fallon doesn't at
cept any campaign contributions from political action
committees. Culver said that 98 percent ofhis dona-
tions are less than the 52,400 cap that Fallon uses.

In other
areas, the
three disagree.
Fallon has at-
tacked the
“Iowa Values
Fund," on inis
tiative that Blr
ouin oversaw,
as giving too
much money
away to big corporations. “‘Leadership’ is too much
in the pocket of special interests," Fallon said, criticizt
ing tat breaks encourage businesses to hire in lowa. “I
want to get big money out of the way.”

Culver supported the fund but agreed that there
were problems, saying that close to onetthird of the
companies that received grants from the Iowa Vulues
Fund had not returned surveys about their job cre-
ntion. “We need more information and accuracy when
it comes to this whole program,” Culver said, calling
for “vcry tough ‘clawbnck’ provisions with penalties."

Blouin defended the progr-nm,“ln the ideal world,
you wouldn’t have to [give tax breaks to attract busis
nesses]," he said. “The real world ﬁnds us competing
with 49 other states.” Blouin snid that Iowa Values
Fund deals with businesses have required them to
pay above the average wage in the areas they employ
workers, and nltendy include “clrnvback” language to
mandate requirements.

Another area of contention is abortion rights.
Both Culver and Fallon are proschoice and have critis
cized Blouin, who is pro-life but has promised not to
restrict or expand abortion rights. “As someone who
