Did you see his tight khaki pants?

Before I begin, let me say that this is just between
you and me. 1 gossip.

We all do, and it’s never been easier. In the din-
ing hall, at the Forum, through Facebook and Gtinncll
Plans, by way of instant messaging and cell phones,
students gossip. To use the words of one exuberant smt
dent, ”Gossip? It's my life blood!”

Who doesn't love to hear the latest juicy tidbit
about someonc else? At Grinnell, the latest gossip trave
els faster, and is at times more shocking, than the nude
cross country team.

Due partly to our isolation on our 130 acre campus,
our conversation often turns inward. Students spcnd
hours discussing othcr snldcnts’ exploits, and their
professors mysterious lives. Whether you are someone
who participates in it, or avoids it, gossip is part of our
world, and it’s not going away

One Grinnell student went so far as to say that
gossip is “a way to affirm
one’s place in a group," and
then outlined guiddines for
this social process. She said
that one “indicates levels of
conﬁdence through who
and what [one] talks about"
with a given person. Thus,
through the sharing ofinformation, and deciding who
to tell secrets to, and whose secrets to keep private, one
defines one's place in a community.

Even the etymological root ofi‘gossip" suggests its
importance to our social fabric even if there is, today,
a strong moral argument against ‘it. The word “gossip"
originally comes from the Old English noun “godsib-
be," which connotes a blood tclation with whom one
has intimate conversations. According to its root, gas,
sip is a way ofsocializing, by sharing personal feelings
with another. The word did not originally have the
negative connotation of “trivial chatty talk," that leads
many people to oppose it today (dittionmywm).

For my purposes, 1 will use a more open definition
from the same source: gossip is a “rumor or talk ofa
personal, sensational or intimate nature." Extrapolating
from this definition, I can imagine a simple binary con
struction; gossip can be “rumor" or ”fact," “malignant"
or “benign."At first glance, I Cannot help but think that
benign factual gossip is preferred. A malignant rumor
is, simply put, rude and unkind. -

This malicious gossip may however strengthen ties
within certain communities by creating the “other,"
thus using negative association to its‘ advantage. Negas

Keep the Danish

By reprinting and commenting on one ofthe infa-
mous Danish cartoon depictions of Muhammad, 772:
Salad has opened up an important campus conversas
tion on religion, hate speech and freedom ofthe press.
We would like to contribute to the dialogue and ex»
press our discomfort at the republication of the cars
[can and the misguided analysis that -
accompanied it. '

We agree with Th: Salads intent
of unmasking the anti-Islamic hate
behind the cartoon. The publication’s
ﬁnal product, however, failed to reflect these good in-
tenuons.

First, The Salad} analysis did not beneﬁt from
printing the cartoon instead of just describing it. Most
major American media outlets, aside from the ultra-
conservative magazine 77!: Met/y Standard, opted not
to print it primarily for this reason. As the New Yolk

tivc association is a dangerous device, but it can be very
effective.

Even though gossip may in fact have social func—

tion, saying defamatory things about people can be
very hurtful, and can even lead to action in a court of
law—but even if courts prove a minor false and “slant
derous," oncc ones name is suliied, it is hard to repair
one’s reputation.
. A few weeks ago. a Clnonit/c oergaoEr/ntanon are
ticle told the story of it professor who says a university
fired has based on false rumors that he was sleeping
with a student, a student he did not know when the
rumors began lfwc believe him, then gossip and gull-
ible/fearful administrators cost the professor his job. In
short, as much as we may enjoy gossiping, it is deﬁ’
nitely something to be wary of, and the above anecdote
suggests gossip, especially rumor, should be avoided.

And yet at a liberal arts college, whcre we are ens
coumged to learn in an in
terdisciplinary way, 1 pro
pose a new vary of looking
at our gossip, in which one
thinks of it as a sociological,
anthropological, psychologe
ical and literary experiment.
History and French majors
spend their days gossiping about dead people, so why
are we not allowed to be interested in living people? Do
we take ourselves that seriously?

Why not be excited by the world around us, share
that excitement with others, while being taccﬁil and
discouraging tumors? Vivid description, in conversae
tion, is more interesting than diatribe. And if you just
cannot control your wicked tongue, you can always
write scathing memoirs about Grinneli, to be pub-
hshed posthumously.

But remember: even if there are many people at
Grinnell who would prefer not to be talked about, some
people are asking for attention, like the student who
sent a campus wide email, wishing us, “Happy Spring
Break” He broke school policy to be recognized, and
it worked!

It would seem that I too, as a columnist with my
mug shot staring at you, want to be the most fashions
able piece of gossip on this campus—no doubt rumors
are ﬂying around campus, after my last article, about
the tightness of my pants.

But honestly, to set the record straight, and of
course, just between you and me, I don’t own any sus
perrligl’ll-yer-supcr-Lrendy khaki pants.

out of The Salad

Times wrote in its Feb. 7 editorial “Those Danish Car-
toons,” this is “a reasonable choice for news organizrr
tions that usually refrain from gratuitous assaults on
religious symbols, especially since the cartoons are so
easy to describe in words." Printing the cartoon risked
offending and isolating Muslims on campus at no ben-
efit to T17: Sandi cause.

second, the analysis ofthe cartoon
disregards the relevance of Islam to the
discussionlnstead ofgivingvoice to the
genuine pain and anger many devout
Muslims felt because of the incident, The Salad seemed
to be dictating to Muslims (and allies) how they should
be outraged. They should be upset, it claimed, because
the cartoon is akin to racist propaganda, and not at all
because it assaulted religious mlues.

Indeed, it is troubling that
