It strikes fear into the hearts of students
across campus The mere mention ofits name
conjures up images ofa secret society gather
ing in an undrsclosed location to pass judge
ment on their peers.

For many, Judicial Coun—
cil (JudCo) is shrouded in
mystery, but people involved
in the organization like SGA
Vice President Michael Bil—
lups ’07 maintain that the or—
gnnizntion isn’t “a mysterious
group of students that are a
bunch of narcs" but rather
exists so that “ifyou happen
to fall out of line with self-
governancc [we] make sure
you didn't do it maliciously,"

JudCo has existed for
over 20 years and was introduced as a check on
selftgovernance by the administration.

The group of {our students, randomly se
lected from an application pool by the SGA
vice president, sit on the council and hear cases
pertaining to policy violations on campus. Af—
ter hearing statements'from both sides, the
students along with a faculty advisor vote on
a recommendation that ranges from no pun-
ishment to expulsion. The recommendation is
then submitted to Dean ofStudent Life Torn
Crady who decides whether or not to act on
the council's ruling.

“Probably 95 percent of the time the ad

ministration goes with what ludCo says," said
Sheree Andrews, assistant Dean of Residence
Life,

Andrews processes the cases, the major
ity of which are raised by the college’s Secut
rity office. Additional cases may be brought
anonymously to the council through Billups
on behalf of the student body. According ro

Andrews, most
of these cases
deal with alcohol
and drug policy
violations as well
as vandalism and
property damage
within the resi-
dence halls, but
not all of these
cases go to Jude
Co. “Sometimes
the cases go to
judicial council,
sometimes they’re dismissed administratively,"
said Andrews

Cases heard by JudCo are conﬁdential,
which may explain some of the confusion as to
the purpose of the council. According to the
Student Handboole “students are prohibited
from revealing specific events that occurred
during the hearing itself, including names and
testimony ofwitnesses" to ensure confidentiale
rty.

Contrary to popular beliefr the students
sitting on JudCo are allowed to reveal their
position on the council. bur there is some dist
pute even among members as to whether that

is advisable. As a former member himselfBilt
lups said, “The general rule is that they are
not supposed to be informing the public that
they are sitting on judCo, but that said it is
their call. When lwas on the council plenty
of people knew.“

Andrews sees ludco as an extension or
self-governance. “It occurs in front of peers,
people who are well aware ofwhat rhc culture
is on the campus,”she said.

But some students who have come before
JudCo do not agree. "The whole thing was
strange," said one anonymous student who
had gone before the committee, “It was late at
night and it was in the basement of the [John
Chrystal center] and no one was around, it
deﬁnitely has a really weird atmosphere and it
felt shameful."

Students remain conﬂised as to the real
purpose ofJudCo. Eric Nost ’09 says, “I think
it should be more publicized because honestly
I don't know a whole lot about it."

Billups, however, isn’t optimistic that the
organization can be public enough to answer
student questions regardingJudCo. Although
he expresses a desire to increase the visibility of
JudCo, he says. “I don't think it can be [trans-
parent], and again it is the confidentiality is-
sue.

but those who wish to reform aspects of
JudCo may have trouble while it remains set
cretive. “I feel like it could be more ofa cont
\lersation than a trial, and they don't call it a
trial but that’s what it is," said the anonymous
student.

When Cynthia Sherman
saw a ﬂower shop going out
of business and looking for
a buyer, she found herselt
wondering ifthe ﬂower busi-
ness was run. Eleven years
later, Sherman is the owner
of the successful Flowers on
Fourth—a store that barely
needs to advertise because of
its name and the attention the
name draws.

Walking in, shoppers may
casily ﬁnd themselves having
sensory overload as they are
greeted by everything from
wine to helium balloons

The number of Various
offerings has expanded as the
business has grown, create
ing a quirky and unexpected
environment where shoppers
are never qurte sure what they
might ﬁnd.

The shop featuies many
luxury gifts for customers of
all ages. Lotions, candles,
stationary and gourmet food
crowd the walls, and part of
the store's attraction is the
possibility of coming across

some unexpected item tucked
away on a back shelf.

One of Sherman’s most
recent additions to her invent
tory is local wine from jasper
Wineries. The bottles range
from $12 to $14, and can be
included rn the custom gift
baskets Sherman offers. The
baskets can include any prod-
ucts available either in Flow-
ers on Fourth o n the town
of Grinnell.

The store also ”/f/ dl‘dn’t spend my days be—
ing creative, I would buy in
town for three mirth more at (rafrstares.”

longevity

Flowers on Fourth might
be located in smallttown
Grinnell, but they are deter

to ﬂowcr shows in order to

trends, allowing their cret
ations to move into the "artsy
[and] new age" according to
Kirkholm.

Clients have the chance
to watch Sherman’s employs
ees at work since the store's
“craft workshop” connects to
the store

Employees, while tak—
ing rhcir work seriously, get a
chalice to ex-
periment with
ﬂoral design.
“I get a chance
to be creative
every day," said

must drrvc from out of town
to work there, they are not
complaining.
