eryone is safe on campus. our four years here can be the

best four years of our lives ifwe work together to make it

so. Cohesion and strength within our communitywill help

acheive this.

I think that the most pressing issue for SGA is to con-
tinue trying to build a confident relationship with the Stur
dent body. In order to achieve this, it requires that we put
forth a great deal of effort. I understand what the students
will expect from me, and I promise my utmost personal ef—
fort in achieving this task.

underwent surgeries on
her legs and was moved

from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the burn unit to reduce the
possibility of infection after surgery. Coburn is an economics major
and manager of the women’s soccer team last semester. She had left

school on medical leave earlier this semester.

Gore is still in the ICU. His family ﬂew in from Japan to be
with him after the crash. Family members said Goto will remain
in the hospital for a long time, but the length of the stay has not
been determined. Goto is also an economics major and an avid phoe
tographer and rock climber. Friends have brought photographs to
the hospital. Tom Cmdy, vice president of Student Affairs said, in
Goto’s case, “it’s awaiting game. No one is going to know anything
more for several days."

Once the families know more, information will be released at
their discretion. The Health Insurance Portability and Account»
ability Act restricts the distribution of medical information to close
fam' A student involved in the accident also requested that a cam—
pus-wide esmail not be sent out to inform the student body about
the accident.

According to Rojas Aguilera, the four students drove to St.
Louis early Saturday morning and attended the Mardi Gras festivi»
ties. Younes said that they, along with another car of Grinnellians,
decided to drive back to Grinnell instead of staying overnight at a
friend’s. They set out at about 3 a.m. on Sunday. Younes drove while
the passengers slept. After about two hours, Younes pulled over and
they slept for under an hour, Rojas Aguilera took over driving and
about two hours later, he pulled off for another short nap,

Younes said he awoke and decided to try to drive the rest of the
way home, playing music loudly to stay awake while the others cons
tinued to sleep, but he nodded off just outside orlowa City. Accord-
ing to the police officer in charge of the case, the car gradually cn-
tered the inside shoulder. Younes woke up once on the shoulder. He
over steered to the right, causing the car to slide across the northeast
lanes, enter the east ditch and roll several times before coming to
rest back upright on the tires. according to the ofﬁcer.

Cobui-n and Goto,wlio were riding in the back seat, were thrown
through the back window Rojas Aguilern said he regained con-
sciousness in the buck seat and climbed out the back window while
off-duty paramedics pulled over to assist. Yolllles was cxtrlcatcd
from the car, where he was trapped, unconscious. All four students
were taken to the hospital by ambulance.

Student Affairs responded Sunday morning as soon as they
heard about the accident. Crady said they met immediately to cons
tact families and support students. They gathered a list of close
friends, contacted protessors and have been sending out e-mail up-
dittes, providing a daily afternoon shurrlc to the hospital and paying

[I’m] assertive, I focus my energy on getting things

Say mmet/ying Io cum-r abpu/ scl - avemame.

I think self-governance is de initely key to making our
students successful during and after Grinnell. Unfortus
nately, there are some misperceptions that exist which I
would like to clarify through the help of Joint Board Sena-
tors, allowing them to connect with both constituents and
the cabinet on an issue that is trulyimportant to all ofus.

W/ml'r :17: number an: rmxmi 2i: ml: for ymf?

I’m confident in my abilities to lead the student body,
and I’ll never BS, you when things go wrong. Discourse
and honesty are the only means to making progress.

Say mmel/Jing [a 1101ch about tefgommnme.

It’s my belief that selfrgovernancc isn't something that
can be taught, but rather . is felt on our campus.We need
to reinforce the idea that self-governance depends on indi»
vidual efforts and a cooperative frame ofmiud.
