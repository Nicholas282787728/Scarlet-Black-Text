Its a mixture of to me, its a mixture ofball—
room and salsa there are two partners and you hold
hands a lot and there's a lot oflirtlc salsa turns,

You can dance to de3 music, rap songs, Any
song that really has a beat, we can step to it, Stop
ping doesn't have speciﬁc music.At competitions, you
dance for two or thiec minutes, but you can mix like
two or rhree songs. We place in every competition

What’s 2/}! fir :1 thing you lc/lplap/c
when l/Juyi'u inyoni slots?

The first thing I tell them is think
sexy, think elegant, think like youic
walking down it catwalk. You want
to feel conﬁdent. The more confi-
dent you look in your dance, the more
confident people see you You always
want to look elegant and classy.

It it inﬁrm/r [a 11747}: dairy and may
at the some time?
No, you have to look like you’re having a nice day
...We is women, we don’t have to do a lot. It’s our job
to follow the guy.

Dori it biliaryoo that you how tofo/lozv [I]! guy,
rm rhough yhlr'rt o really good donor independently?

The rnain thing is to keep looking classy. What
makes a good dancer is a good follower. You know, he
turns you and you complete it. Step is big on looking
good.

Com 1: In [ramming a! a competition, film, that

maybe l/Ic bell looting tau/)1! will com earn yyonie [be
her: dnllwr [erbium/(y?

At competition, they have four or five categories:
“synchronization" “appearance,"l can't remember the
others. So you may get a five for appearance but if
you're not good on being synchronized,you’re nor gar
ing to do well. And at competition. everyone is going
to look nice. Appearance is everything and knowing
what you're doing. You want to be the best looking
couple, it’s all about partnership,

What’s your mlnzl'mlibip line with your partner?

My partner and l have been dancing together lon-
ger than any other steppers in Chicago we'vo been
stepping together since ‘99 and ifwc don‘t dance with
each other, we dont dance They call him smooth
Ken" in Chicago, because everybody cant be smooth.
So we kinda click, we kinda full togerher. When people
know that they donr work with someones personals
iry in Chicago, they're not going to dance together
A slowestepping person would not ever dance with a
ﬁrstrstepping person. So everybody don’t match with

everybody else.

I: [/JL‘Y‘L' a [at oration i'fyoii guyi r/on’z

Me, I don't care, but Kenny is
very competitive. One time we placed
third at this competition and he was
so mad, but we didnr even praerieei If
you don’t practice, you wont be good.
You cant automatically be cocky and
say were gonna place

It the areppmgmzze on the rire or i: it

in its heyday right now?
They call Chicago the Steppin’ Capital because
it started here, it originated here, but it’s spreading
verywhere. We’ve taught in LA. we’ve taught in At-
lanta. I think it's on the rise big time. You know how
you go on a cruise and .most cruises you go on you
have salsa lessons? Now we’re teaching srepping on

a Cruise.

It‘s like both. In Chicago, everyone is reaching it.
It's on the South Side, it's on the West Side, it’s on
the North Side. It’s okay not to know about stepping,
especially it you don't live in Chicago. It originated
in the 19505 and 605 and it started out as this dance
called “Hopping". Everything repeats itself, but when
it repeats itself, it gets an upgrade, The great thing
about it is, is it’s not just for black people. We got
Asians, we got Mexicans, we got white people. It's for
everybody, it’s not just for black culrure. Everybody
teaches at a club, in their house. We’re trying to start
a dance studio, but it’s like here today gone tomorrow
because at a club, they want you to buy drinks.

Yau mm: and Miller! Grinnell lusty/car, 1047, What did
you thm/e ifthe :tua'ml hody?

It was great. It was great because we had students
from all over the world, everybody had all ditterenr
styles of dancing from all the nationalities. We had a
whole lot orsrudents, and hopefully it can get bigger
and bigger. Hopefully we can get some students who
are from a country I’ve never heard orit.
