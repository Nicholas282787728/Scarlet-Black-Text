Supporting
Israel not
just idealistic

As Grinncll’s fall semester of 2006 began,
the inlnl’wﬂf between Israel and Hezbollah
was just winding down, and, as one would
expect, rnany Gtinnellians have been keen to
offer their views on the conﬂict and what the
Us. should do about it.

However, most of the views that I have
heard have exhibited the same fallacy, all too
t‘amrlrrr to those of us who advocate a strong
U.S:Istael relationship.

As the argument goes, the us, may be do—
ing “the right thing" in supporting a fellow dc-
mocracy nndei siege in a troubled region of the
world, but in a post-9/ll world where many
not only claim to hate us for our support for
Israel, but make good on their threats, main»
taining an alliance with the Israelis is just too
costly. In other words, American support for
Israel is too idealistic,

There are many good counterrargumenrs
to this VIBW7namely, that abandoning a clue
cial ally makes the Us. look weak and untrust~
worthyibut what I would like to do heie is
just to offer a few concrete examples of how
American support for Israel could serve Amer-
ica’s interests in the most real and tangible of
ways.

First, itAmerica had not been partially res
sponsible for pressuring Isracl into withdraws
ing from the Sinai Peninsula in 1979 and from
Lebanon in 2000, insurgents in Iraq would
not be causing American and Coalition troops
there so much trouble,

After Israel ceded the Sinai to Egypt in
1979 under the Camp David accords negotrs
ared by thean.S, President Jimmy Carter,
a “cold peace” between Egypt and Israel fol—
lowed, wrrh no major hostilities between the
Egyptian and Israeli armies, but domestic fac-
tors in Egypt—namely, the rise ofIslamic hm-
damentalism—hegan to challenge the Egyp-
tian governmcnt's grip on power.

What makes these developments relevant
for current American policy in Iraq and the
Middle East as a whole is the geopolitical

importance ofthe Sinai Peninsula.

The Sinai serves as the only land bridge
between Africa and Asia and,wirh the Egyp-
tian government’s growing loss of control,
the Sinai has become THE major smuggling
route tor jihadi recruits from Europe's Muslim
communities and North Africa into Iraq. The
alrQiida presence on the Sinai has even been
deemed stronger than the alrQiida presence
in Afghanistan under the Taliban regrrne be
fore the U.S.rled "Vi/at on Terror" began in the
fall of 2001.

Nonetheless, the Sinai does not directly
connect the African continent to Iiaq, and so
the smuggling otnghters, funds and weapons
to the Insulgency in Iraq must take routes
through various Arab states.

one otthe most important of these routes
is on the Syrian border with Lebanon, in a
rcglon of the Bekaa Valley known as I-lerniel.
The networks there are controlled by an infar
mous terrorist named Imad Mugnryah.who is
perhaps the only individual on the planet to
have a close working relationship with both the

Asia Sample ’10

leadership of Iran and Hezbollah, on the one
hand, and Osama bin Ladcn, on the other,

If America had not pressured Israel into
leavrng the Smal or from finishing on Her
zbollah. none of these developments would
have threatened American troops in Iraq, and
the ability of al’Qlldﬂ and Iran to commit
terrorist acts internationally would have been
signiﬁcantly lessened.

Second, one fact about the ciucial Persian
Gulf region that often goes unnoticed in the
American and Western media is that, while
the governments that rule over the Arab side
of the Persian Gulf are Sunni Muslims, a ma-
jority ofthe population are Shi'sr

Since the us, pressured Israel into not
achieving a dec' vc victory in its recent war-
wrth thc Shi'a terrorist group Hezbollah,
many ofthe Shi'a in the Persian Gulf may be
gin wondering why they should be afraid of
destabilizing their U.S.rallied Sunni govern
ments.

In other words,by pressurrng Israel in order
to appease Arab and Muslrm rage, the United

 

States may have eliminated its most effective
deterrent against the spreading of the Sunni~
Shi'a civil war in 1an across the entire Persian
Gulf, thus endangering to unprecedented le
els both America's supply of oil and our ab

to strike Iran, should we choose to do so.

As al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri
warned America in his reeent Videotape com-
memorating the 9/11 attacks, “Do not worry
about your forces in Iraq in Afghanistan, they
are doomed, Instead, worry about your pres-
ence in two plﬂccst The first is the Gulf... and
the second is Istael",

I hope I have demonstrated that a strong
American-Isracli alliance is not just a pic-in-
the-sky partnership in today's troubled world
I do not mean to imply that American support
for Israel is either wellrlikcd or a panacea, and
I realize that some of my conclusions would
prompt even most hawkish Israelis and Israels
supporters to have me institutionalized, but I
thrnk that we must formulate a foreign policy
that places security above popularity.

Seek satanic, cheese-heavy fun to the north

Wisconsin kicks ass! As a Wisconsinite, someone might
claim that I’m biased in this opinion, but I personally find my
views to be fullyjustiﬁcd.

For example, this whole “Real cheese comes from happy
cows, Happy cows come from California" ad campaign is just
an attempt to steer consumers away from what they already
know is the best. But who really
thinks that California is better than
Wisconsin?

I mean, yts, we're a state with
just about as much farming as Iowa.
Yes, we wear brg slabs of choose on
our heads and watch football half
naked in lielolwzero weather.

And yes,we have pretty hind—cote margar inc laws, but when
you’re looking for that exua thtril in your lite, that little extra
ye ne rarrﬁriirrair (only Germans and Irish here), when you're
looking to dabble in some carnal tun (complete with whips .rnd
handcuffs), Wisconsin should be your one and only destinar
tion.

As the orhcr Midwest states are going to church and helps
ing old ladies t id prrpprt- cross the road, Wisconsin's listening
to satanic m and sleeprng with all the drunk girls on the
UV! canipus.Trust me; there me a lot ofthemr A feat like that
takes endurance,

th very few people seem aware of Wisconsin’s superior
stamina and skills (we have a lot of sprrrt tinro durrng rhoso
cightrnonthrlong winters and we have to get a little creative),
which is why I am doing my best to rarsc awaiencss of our
state’s greatness.
