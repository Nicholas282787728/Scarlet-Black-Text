Cage workers give athletes
more than clean laundry

3v ALYSIA VALLAS

Three oversized washing machines
and two huge dryers spin. Coop neatly
folds a football jersey while explain-
ing how athletes have personal inesh
bags that hold their individual laundryl
Coop and cosworker Rog will put the
bags of clean laundry into the athletes'
lockers before piactice, then wash them
all again afterwards.

if you’ve ever used a towel at the
gym, borrowed a tennis racquet from
the 1’EC,or seen an athletic team look
ing snazzy, then you've seen the work
ofRogcr Bauman and Ron Cooper, the
school's personable cage workers, or
ﬁcially, they are “equipment managers,"
but that rirle fails to describe the many
tasks they complete day in and day out
and the inﬂuence they have on athletes
and coaches.

They loan out an array of equip
ment, pack all travel bags and do copi-
ous amounts of athletes‘ laundry And
rhcy've done it for many year5‘27 for
Cooper and 21 for Baumtin.

But if you ask athletes and coaches
to tell you about “Mr, Cooper," they
might ask you who that is. Oi they
might ask, “Oh, do you mean ‘Coop’?"

Coop doesn't mind his nickname,
“I’m like Cher and Bono, down to a
four—letter name," he said as he walked
into the large PEC laundry facility.

When Coop isn’t tossing around
laundry bags, he stays active by helping

out with the SGA Concerts Comm}?-

too, where he has a chance to indulge
his love for music. He cites jazz guitar
ist Albert Collins as a personal favorite,
and parrieularly enjoys jazz and blues.
coop was also instrumental in bringing
Little Ed and the Blues Imperials to a
concert out in town over the summer.

Coop is also well known for his par
Litical conspiracy theories.

“I’ll have faculty menihers come up
to me and say,‘Hey Coop,you knowyou
were right about that one!” he said.

The rcnms depend on the cage
workers for more than clcnn laundry
and conspilacics, though. Each fall due
‘mg football camp the team heads out
ro Bauman’s residence—known simply
as “Roger’s Farm”—to do some ﬁshing
in his pond and to ear home-cooked
barbecue

The ﬁshing is often comedic, as
many of the players have never fished
before. Many of the big, strong linemen
are hesitant to touch the slimy half-
pound fish at the end oftheir lines. But
they don't hesitate to eat the plentiful
Bauman family cooking that greets
them after their ﬁshing.

Athletes and coaches said that
Roger opening up his house re host the
team every year is representative ofjust
the pe of uy that he is

“YRoger? is the right kind of per
son, football co offensive coordinator
zaeh Fletcher ’03 said. “If everyone
lived their lives like Roger does, the
world would be a better place"
