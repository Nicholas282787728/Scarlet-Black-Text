Chris Neubert YO8 arrived in Sri Lnnka three days
after rebel troops declared the end of a four-year
ceaserfire, Neubert, along with three other Grinnell
studentsiAlex McKinley ’08, Liz Swanton '07 and
Jayme Siegel’07ﬂre attending the University ofPerr
adeniya in Kandy, Sri Lanka until December. Even
though the university is far from the contested areas
of the island nation, the bloody ﬁghting less than 100
miles avmy affects their daily lives~and those of their
friends back in Grinnell.

The nation ofSri Lanka is currently in the middle
ofa civil war between the government, dominated by
the island’s Sinhalese majority, and an ethnic Tamil
separatist group known as the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). More than 60,000 people were
killed over two decades of war before a cease-fire took
effect in 2002. Hostilities slowly resumed at the end
onOOS and byluly 2006 were in full force.

Siegel, who is staying in the village ofBowela, said
by email that the Intercollegiate sri Lanlta Edu-
cation Program (ISLE) program has placed restric-
tions on the
students.They
are barred
from the north
and east of the
island, where
heavy ﬁghting
has occurred, and also from the capital at Colombo,

In addition, ISLE has asked that the students
avoid possible targets like the Esala Perahera, a major
annual festiwil in Kandy that dates back to the 18th
century,

Because Kandy is located far from the contested areas
ofSri Lanka, the program continued this year despite
a State Department travel advisory for the country.

The ISLE Program and the Grinnell Ofﬁce of
OfrrCampus study are taking some precautions to
ensure the students safety by limiting their move-
ment. But Richard Bright, director ofoff-Cnmpus
Study, said that students are made aware of the risks
before they go and accept them as part orthe chance
to travel to Sri Lanka. Bright relies on the ISLE pro-
gram to ensure students'safety.

According to Bright, the ISLE prognim is run by
Sti Lankan “academic specialists" who consult with
the U.S. State Department. “The program is directly
responsible for studeiits’sarety,"Bright added,

Despite the restrictions on students’ activities
and the reassurances ot’ the Grinnell administration,
friends of the students are concerned for their safety.

Osgood’s
contract
extended

Attempt to poach Osgood be~
hind April trustee action

3v LAURA ARNOLD AND KATHVRN BENSON

When the Board of Trustees met at the end of
April, their agenda dealt with some business as usual:
plotting the future of tuition at Grinnell, awarding
several faculty endowed chairs and meeting with stuv
dents. There was also something unexpected—ex-
tending President Russell K. Osgood‘s contract to
fend offa headhunter. ‘

Osgood's contract, which was‘to expire in 2009,
was extended until july 1, 2011 by a unanimous vote
of the trustees, The board did not consult faculty or
students in their decisrom Their decision was in re-
sponse to another institution's attempt to recruit Os-
good rway from Grinncll. Osgood’s salary will remain
unchanged,

Professors
were troubled
that their
opinions were
not solicited.
“We found out
about it after
the decision
was made,“
Wayne Moyer,
Political Science, said, “We were concerned that we
weren‘t consulted, so we sent a letter to the Board of
Trustees.”

Board President Notdahl Brue ’67 said that the
trustees had acted without consultation because of the
perceived urgency of the situation. In the future, Bruc
said that board will try to keep faculty more regularly
involved in rhe process of reviewing the president so
this faculty won’t be excluded again.

Some students were perplexed by the trustees’
hasty decision. “1 think they should talk to the SGA
and faculty, the people this affects,” Greta Swanson
'08 said.

Current SGA President Chris Hall ’06 said that
while it was important to consult students in some
cases, he didn’t think this was one of them. “I think
consulting the student body is important and reason~
able for hiring a new president rather than extending
a contract," Hall said. “Some students disagree due to
the fact they don’t agree with some of osgpod’s polar
cies.

occurs every
ﬁve years with
the input of
faculty and
trustees. Be-
tween these
major reviews, the trustees alone do performance re-
views.

Typically, before a contract renewal, a large-scale
appraisal would occur. Because of the abrupt nature
of this latest renewal, only the trustees were able to
contribute to the assessment.

Brue said that 'the trustees approve of Osgood's
