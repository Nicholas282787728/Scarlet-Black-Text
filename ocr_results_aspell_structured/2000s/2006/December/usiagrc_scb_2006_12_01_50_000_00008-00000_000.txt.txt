A wise man once told me that awiewar-dness is a
choice. Granted, this same wise man has also scolded
me tor wearing pants in the library, personally ad
dressed me while streaking and told me that if he

were ever attacked by a shark, he would allow it to ’

swallow him whole and
then punch his way out.l
strll think he had a good
point about that whole
awkward thing.

I’ve probably wasted
entirely too mneh of my
life worrying about the
impression that I have on people in any number of
inane situations Really, it shouldn't matter whether

The men’s and women's cross
country teams have been celebrating
the end of their seasons with Stupid
Week for longer than most students
and faculty members can remember.
One Stupid Week staple is “Dinner in
a PEC towel."Thc men’s and women’s
teams check out clean PEC towels and
wear them to dint
not once during
the week. No one
exposes any more
skin than could
be seen had we all
worn skirts. There
rs no college dress
code that we can
break.

Runners from
both teams showed up at the dining hall
on Monday night. dressed in standard
PEC towel attiie. Many of the women
arrived ﬁrst and were turned away by
a P-Card checker. The women under
standably askcd why not. The checker
told them they were "advertising." She
went on to question their intelligence
and wonder what would "happen" to
them rttliey left the dining hall looking
like that. The majority of the women
went back to the PRC and returned
to_the dining hall fully clothed with

towels pinncd around them in various
manners,

A group of male runners arrived
at the dining hall shortly after, with
their towels pinned around their waists,
They were also turned back, this time
by several dining hall workers now
waiting for them at the entrance. They
were told they had to have something
on underneath their towels. Some of
the men asked how this was any differs
cut from wearing a skirt into the d' rig
hall. The workers

would be violating
state health codes.
As soon as the first
member of the
group expressed his
displeasure, a din-
ing serViccs worker
called security. sayt
ing into her radio
that “you need to get over here now.”

The men walked back to the PEC
and put on running shorts underneath
their towelsAs they walked back to the
dinning hall,Russ Motta pulled up next
to them. The runners assured him that
they were all wearing shorts under therr
towels and continued to the dining hall
entrance, Before admitting any of the
runners, the checkers as d them to lift
up their towels, to make sure they were
indeed wearing shorts. This continued
unrrl Russ iorned the group, assuring

the workers that he had talked to all the
runners. The group was t‘rnally able to
join their teammates and eat_dinner.
The majority of the team is oft
fended by the conduct of the dining
hall workers, We do not buy into the
logic that, as one dining hall worker
told us, with a "new building comes
new rules” Nor drd we appreciate
their harsh, judgmental comments. We
have not seen workers checking under
the skirts of any women entering the
dining hall, and consider their actions
Monday night equally oitcnsive.

With the same case as we do in thc'
