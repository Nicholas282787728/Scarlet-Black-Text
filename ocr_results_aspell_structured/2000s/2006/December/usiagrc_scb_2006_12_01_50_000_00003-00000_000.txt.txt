Stores don’t sweat “everyday low prices"

After a new Wal— Mart SuperCenter moved in grocery stores have slightly lower sales but other shops are doing fine

WalanIarts t'nmous blue sign and
“every day low prices“ have been in
Grinnell since 1985. Last May, howev—
er, the much-maligned discount retailer
moved from its traditional store to a
much larger superCenter, half a mile
down the road. The local debate about
the construction of the Siipchenter
featured concerns about the dcvastat-
ing effects the new store would have on
local businesses

Six months after the new store
opened, most of those feats appear not
to have materialized. While managers
of local grocery stores say that their
sales have suffered slightly from Wal-
Marts entry into (l1!) business other

businesses in Grinnell have not noticed '

a change.

The biggest inventory change in a
SiipetCenter is the addition of grocers
lest Randy Smith, a manager at Mc-
NJLly's Supchalue Foods, said he had
noticed the competition, “The grocery
stores are taking 2| hit." he said. “CHS’
tomeis go to [Vthlanlart] for other
items and now they can pick up bllnann
as and a gallon ofimlk."But Smith said
losses from VVAJ’MM’I have not been
signiﬁcant. “There are [still] two other
grocery stores besides us."

Fareway store manager Steve Tier
bur also said business was still doing
well.

Other businesses simply do not
View themselves as WalsMart competit
tors. FiherWorks owner Betsy Shane
noit is not concerned. “For people who
know really good fabrics, there’s no
competition,” said Shannon. “We don’t
carry certain notions [such as thimblcs]
because we know we can't compete."

Shannon said the store had also
decided not to carry ﬂeece because of
competition. other inventory changes,
such as yarn. are due to different ms.
tomer preferences and not WalsMart’s
impact. .

Tony lVlafﬁn, manager of Family
Video since April, is also unbothered
by competition with wal-Mart. “They
compete with us. Our prices are more
competitive than theirs,”Mafﬁn saidr

Maff‘in said that the sale of certain

items has been “trending downward,"
but added that theie was no way to at—
tribute this to Wal-Mart. He also said
WalsMarl may bring in additional
business. "People in surrounding small
towns that don’t have WalsMart may
come here to shop, and as they’re driVs
ing by, they may stop at Family Video
too,” Maffin said.

Bikes to You owner Craig Cooper
was more critical of the effect of Wal»
Mart stores in general. He said small,

independent manufaeturers producing
what he called “fringe produets" have no
chance in the presence ofa large chain.
"‘Alwrlys low prices’ means the product
costs less to be produced," which leads
to lower quality, Cooper said

Cooper does not see the Wal-Mart
Supercenter as a new problem. “Most
of the retailers that were regularly ims
pacted by direct competition [from
Wat-Mart] closed down years ago," he
said.

Wal.Mart Super-
Center opened in May,
