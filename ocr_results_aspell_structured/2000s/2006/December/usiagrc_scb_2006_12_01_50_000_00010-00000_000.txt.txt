Women’s hoops team IS 3-1 and looking for upsets

EV NATE LINDSEY

The womens basketball team is off to A hot start, \vaImg
three straight games after losing their first gamc at home. Coir
otado College downed Grinnell 68 63' In the opener, but wins
against Coe, Central and MacMurr-ay gave the Pioneers their
ﬁrst throorgamc winning streak stuee the 20034004 season.

Poor outside shooting doomed Grinnell against Colorado
College, as the Pioneers shot just 16 percent from behind the
are in the Nov. 18 contest,

“We were in the ball game in the last minute," coach Andy
Hamilton said, “The bottom line is that we just didn't knock
down our shots."

The team bounced right back against Coc College the
next day with a 76771 \lictoryWhile the team's shooting from
the field improved greatly, stcllar free throw shooting (15715)
pushed Grinnell passed the Kohawks, Both Hannah \Volf'08
and Katie Shumaehcr '08 went 474 from the line.

Wolf, who is a thrccryear starter and ecscaptdin, believes
the team is more versatile on offense than last year.

“We're getting into the lane a lot better, and [we arc] not
just setIlIng for outside shots like we've done in the past,"VVo|f
said. "We're doing a good job of getting ourselves in positions
where we can get to the free throw line and score with the clock
stopped l'

1n the team's second win against central, Wolf scored 57
points including seven of 10 from three-point range to help
dcfcat the Dutch 3040 last Wednesday in Pclla.

“She had a phenomenal night," Hamilton said. “Hannah
has been known as just a three point shooter in her past two
seasons, but hcr game has really clevatcd this year taking thc
ball to the basket and .naking threes.

Grinncll picked up their third victory against lVIach/lur—
ray 5450 last Saturday. Emily Kolhc ’07 led the team with 19
points on 8715 shooting, including 275 from beyond the arc.
Anna Fuel '10 snaggcd 16 rebounds, 13 ofwhich were offensive
in leading the Pioneers to a +17 rcbonnd margin.

After starting 3-1 against non-conference opponcnts,
Grinncll heads to Wisconsin to begin MWC play against st.
Norbert today and against Carroll College tomorrow.

The preseason coachcs'poll pIckcd Carroll and st. Norbert
to finish one and nvo respectively, thc samc finishes the two
teams claImcd at last year's Midwest Conference Tournament.
The Pioneers were picked to finish eighth overall.

Despite the preseason poll's prognostications that put st.
Norbert second in the conference, the Pioneers will head into
the game with a chip on their shoulders and a lot ofmotivation
to get a victory. The Lady Pioneers have ncvcr defeated the
Green Knights and fins of both teams are reminded of this

when they read the game program any time the two meet in
De Pere,Wisc. However, this year st. Norbert has a weak spot.

“I think that st. Norbert i, a little on young at the guard
[position]," said Hamilton. “And if our players can frustrate
their guards we might be able to pull it off."

Besides an extra effort from Wolfnnd the rest ofGrinnell’s
guards, the Lady Pioneers will nccd to contain post players El-
len Hake and Bianca White, two senior three-year starters for
the Green Knights/It o' 1" mo 6’0" respectively, the two pose a
dominant force in the paint and on the boards,

Grinnell will rely on FrIcI and Caitlin Shannon '07 to
match-up in the post. Shannon is splitting time with Fricl as she
recovers from a knee injury sustaincd during the preseason.

“I think we have the best attitude headmg Into St. Norbert
that we've ever had," Shannon said. “Our freshmen bring a lot
to thc tcam.This is one of our morc experienced teams, but the
freshmen bring an edge [0 the attitude ofbeating St. Norbert."

with the momentum gained in their non-conference games,
the outlook for the conference season is better than It has been
in recent seasons, and the team will have two opportunities for
big upsets this weekend.

“This team is absolutely amazing,"Shannon saidf‘lt hit me
after MacMuarry.Therc's a lot of potential in this team."

Coach Arseneault wins 200th, MWC play begins tonight

The “funnandngun” men’s basketball team
recorded their first win of the season last Satr
urday in typical highrscoting fashion, defeating
MuuVlurray College, 135.113. Coach David
Arseneault, mastermind of Grinncll‘s unique,
up—tempo style simply called “The system,”
notchcd his 200th careei victory.

Grinnell has many reasons to expect a good
season this year. Keith Chamberlain ’08 led the
conference with 29 blocks last season, and is
tied for the team lead in rebounds this season,
averaging 5.5 boatds a game.

“It was nice to make [the MWC tonrnar
mcnt] last year after missing it my freshman
year,” Chamberlain said, “But we're going to
do better this year."

“Baby" Dave neault '09 returns after
leading the nation in assists as a ﬁrst-)ear last
season with 1981 He has Iecorded back-to»
back double doubles this season, scoring 21
points and dishing out 11 assists in an opening
season loss to Carthage, followed by 13 points
and 12 assists against IvlacMurray

In addition to rcnirning last year’s assists
leader and blocks leader. the Pioneers return
their leading scorer in John Grotbctg'tw. Last
year's 31.4 points per game was good enough
for second in the nation and earned the Ann
Arbor native preseason Honorable Mention
Alermerica honors treading into this season.

Grotberg has lofty aspirations tor this season
and the test ofhis career both individually and
for the team

This year, I want to win the conference
tournament and make the NCAA playoffs,
Cirotberg said. He added that leading the en-
trrc country in scoring is among his individual
goals, and he wants to break both school and
national records for scoring in a career. He
is off to a great start this year, with 32 in the
opener and a career high 52 against MacMur-
ray,

When asked about the szrpoint game,
Grotbcrg deferred to his teammates. “We
played really well defensively, and lots ofguys
in my group were getting steals, setting me
up for easy buckets," he said. “They also did
a great job setting screens, making it easy to
score."

Grotberg also credited off-season work,
claiming he had "increased his offensIvc eff
cisncy, learning how to score in different situ»
ations," This may be frightening news for the
rest of the Midwest conference, considering he
led the conference in three pointers made with
120 last season.

All of Grotbcrgs preseason goal s secm
reachable IvIth such a talented squid, but
thiecrtime reigning conference champs Law—
rcncc University once again held the top spot
in the preseason coaches’ poll. Grinncll was
ranked fourth, behind Lawrence, Carroll and
Ripon, A fourth place finish in confcrcnce
would secure a conference playoff spot.

The Ploncers take the hardwood today
against conference foe St. Norbert. In years
past, the Green Knights have slowed the game
down, trying to stop Grinnell from running
and shootlng them out of the building. Grotc
berg and Arseneault will look to push the tem-
po while Chamberlain will anchor the defense.

Does any coach have the guts to pull his QB?

As a Bears fan, am I allowed to pray for injuryrprone quar
terbaek Rex Grossmun to blow out his ACL next week)

Many fans might find that preposterous.The Bears are 972
and hold a two game lead over the rest of the NFC for playoff
home field advantage. Their defense has been an unstoppable
force throughout the season, and Rex is still a young quarter
back learning the game. Besides,
he’s 1376 as a starter, How could
a fan want Grossman’s head on a
stick?

Easy: 1 saw last Sunday's 1743
loss against the Patriots.Thi$_ year's
Bears team is the best I've ever seen
(Note: not alive for 1985). and I’m
supposed to support a QB who thanks his defense for forcing
five turnovers by throwing three picks and fumbling a snap in
side the Patriots ftvcryatd line?

Grossman’s “brilliance" this year is a farce. He's played well
in as many games as he’s laid an egg. has frvc TD passes and
10 picks in his last six games and has the second lowest fourth

Iwoultl get my hopes np for a little QB eompctition between

It’s not just Lovie who fails to re-
alizc when to replace a mimic [Cn-
tleney to award as tenure to anyone
who puts togctltcr a couple of good
games has hampered the snccess of
a number of NFL teams ill recent
years, Coaches wait too long to pull starters (or oven acknowl-
edge that theres a problem), leaving injury as the only viable
way to bring a change. For instancc:

If Cowboys coach Bill Parcclls ssw the ineptitude of DIew
Bledsoe earlier in the year and opted for backnp Tony Romo,
could the Cowboys currently be challenging the Bears for the
best record in the NFC? Would the ongoing problems with

Excessive m3 loyalty is becoming an epidemic in the NFL
No onc ever suffered from a little competition. but apparently
NFL coaches dont think that putting a QBs job' In jeopaidy

a bit of advice to NFL fans: If your favorite team's quarterback
