Last semester, about 15 people gathered

in Music House to watch student band open ‘

Throat Surgery perform. The crowd dwindled
to three during the set, but that did not stop
the musicians from grinding out punk metal
beats and riffs.

“My band docsnr play music that a lot of
people on campus listen to necessarily, [but the
three people who stayed] were just having fun,”
said drummer Kenny
Allison '07. “They
were just rockin’ out."

Open Throat

Surgery is one or
around a dozen active
campus bands, ac-
cording to Freesound
leader Eric Rohn TOS.
With the help of Freesound, Grinnellians can
ﬁnd a student show on campus about every
other week. Gardner and Loose lounges, Mu-
sic House and Bob’s Underground frequently
serve as venues.

Garrett Shelton '01 formed the student
group in 1998 with the primary mission of
helping musicians meet other musicians. The
necessity for practice space, common equipt
ment and campus shows soon expanded the
group’s goals. Freesound also now releases an
annual campus hands compilation CD at the
end ofthe academic year.

Musicians are still meeting each other
through Freesound. Drummer Chris Knap
'08 and his friend, guitarist Robin Culter '08,
met keyboardist/vocalist Mark D'Agostino
’08 through the group's meetings and mailing
list. They went on to form Vegetable Medley
23 with bass guitarist JePfWiner ’08 in fall of
2004.

Since then, they have played a handful of
times around campus, including some Free

Freesound provides practice space, equipment

soundtfacilitated concerts. They have used
Freesound equipment, and the ayailable expens
sive and bulky equipment Like the PA system
and drum set have been particularly helpful to
them and other bands, said Knup.

Allison believes that providing working
equipment is the most important function of
Freesound. “1 don’t have my own drum set
here," said Allison, “[and] it’s unreasonable
,..to bring drums to a practice. so having a

common drum set
that everyone can use
is nice,"

Kuap said that
he thinks Freesound
is doing a good job
overall, but he hopes
that in the future
there can be more

concerts, with the majority being “smaller
shows with a smaller number of bands, [with]
each band playing a little longer."

Rohn said meeting the group’s goals has
been difﬁcult at times, mainly because of low
ﬁlnding and a lack of support from SGA,
which many in Freesound feel stems from
many instances of broken equipment in past
years. Freesound has been operating with
around 3900 per semester, which Rohn says
makes it diﬂicult to fund repairs and replaces
ments ofinstruments. “We have about one of
everything [working], and we’ve got about one
ofeyerything broken,” he said.

SGA Treasurer Matt Cleinman ’06 said
that Freesound spent just $325 of their 3900
budget during the fall semester and stressed
that Freesound receives some of the highest
funding from SPC ofany non-sports group.

Rohn said that the money went unspent
last semester because an order was postponed
by the sdler past the end of the fall semester
due to delivery difﬁculties. He said that he had

ing to get some of the unspent money mallet
cated to spring semester.

Music House has hosted practices this
year, but there are concerns about security, the
locations inconvenience for North Campus
residents and the future fate of the arrange—
ment.

Both SGA and Freesound agree that keeps
ing equipment secure and in working order
are keys to justifying nature funding. Last year,
a keyboard and drum set in the Norris space
were vandalized, and there was a similarihut
less expensivchincident at Music House

this year. some inexpensive items like itar
cables have been found missing. Rohn feels
that a monitored and controlled access praCt
tice space would help prevent future vandalism
and theft.

In addition to improving security, “having
[practice space] in a space like the new camt
pus center or Harris would be optimal because
students would be able to access it and not
have angry residents [because of the noise],"
said Rohn.

He added that the administration has
communicated with Freesound about possible
practice space in those locations.
