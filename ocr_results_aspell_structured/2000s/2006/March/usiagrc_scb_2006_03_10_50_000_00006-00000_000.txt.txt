Rabbits, geishas and thumbsuckers

Wallace and Gromit: The
Curse of the Were Rabbit (G)

l-lonor, comedy, detective film, family film, ro-
mance—it is impossible to pigcouholc Ila/lore and
Storm}: Cull! aft/M Wm Rulbiz into any one genre.
The film, a claymation feature, goes from one genre
to another, using diﬂ’eient styles whenever appropri-
ate. It tells an expansive story, full of laycrcd humor:
simple slapstick for all ages and some surprisingly
raunchy jokes for adults.

The broad oudine for any Wallace and Gromit
story usually involves a new invention crafted by Wale
lace and that invention leading an odd pair offricnds
into a world of trouble. In this film, the invention is
a mind-altering machine, designed to Cure rabbits of
their troublesome habit of \lcgctahlcscariug. Chaos
ensues, and their profession of garden security changs
es to that of private detectives, hot on the trail of an
insatiable melon-munching beast.

It’s important to note just what went into this film:
five years of effort and reputedly 2.8 tons of plasticine
clay. The result of this work is apparent in the ins
credible levels of attention applied to each scene. For
example, when the reverend of the church opens his
closet to retrieve golden bullets, we see a truly impress
sive assembly of gadgets and books for hunting the
undead Although some of the fog and other graphi-
cal elements were actually made with CGI, any such
special effects blend in seamlessly

Nick Park's claymation projects have always
been incredibly charming, and this new Wallace and
Gromit feature is no exception. The bunnies are cute
beyond measure, and Groinit continues to communir
cate through his signature expressive, silent gestures.
But its characters are not the only things that lend
charm to the movie. The style of the film, with its
faithful homage to old horror films, creates a wonder-
ful atmosphere that envelops almost every scene.

High school is a difficult time Those turbulent
adolescent years are only confounded by erratic sexual
impulses, drugs, peer pressure, drinking and the cams
petitive atmosphere that permeates academia in this
country. Tlamlraclo- encapsulates these challenges
through the life ofJustin Cobb (Lou Taylor Puccl).

Justin is a mediocre high school student who se—
ctetly sticks him thumb despite persistent rebukes
from his parents. Although Justin struggles with
friends, his family and school, he manages to court
Rebecca (Kelli Garner), an attractive activist at his
high school. Unfortunately, the relationship is short-
lived, as is Justin’s life of mediocrity.

His pathologically philosophical dentist Perry
(Keanu Reeves, long hair and all) uses homeopathic

techniques and hypnosis to rid Justin of his thumb
sucking forever, much to Justin’s chagrin.

oncr Justin's universe moves beyond his thumb,
he begins to excel in school and extracurricular activis
ties (with a little help from a drug called Ritalin). He
particularly excels in debate, which he initially joined
to further court RebeccarJustin's debate coach is Mr.
Geary (Vince Vaughn), who at one point purchases
alcohol for the underage students at a debate tournas
ment. Yet problems still abound in Justin's family and
beyond.

While watching this film I realized the extent to
which so many films espouse the “Great Man Theory
oinstory."All too often,the main character seems to
surpass every other person in the universe of the film,
as if they are the only one worth depicting. Despite
Tbimilrueter’s independent status, Justin’s transfors
mation into a diligent student similarly shows him as
being the best ateverything he does. During one shot,
every student in the school stares atJiistin as he walks
down the hall, as though he were a masterpiece in a
famous museum.

Despite the proclivity of directors to depict char
acters in films as superior, the director Mike Mills has
created an interesting premise: a simple habit can die-
tate much of our lives and that, although we are truly
capable oftransforming ourselves, the change is either
truly permanent or just a temporary shroud. We all
are aware of the old adage “always be yourself," but
who is yourself really?

this to create the most beautiful film of last year. Eva
ery frame of this movie looks incredible, and the film
truly deserved to win the three Oscars it did (Art Di-
rection, Cinematography and costume Dcsiganhar
being said, Memoir; is ultimately a movie that puts
moie energy into style than substance.

The film is based on a best-selling book of the
same name. Sold by her parents, a young girl, Chiyo
(Ziyi Zhang), becomes an apprentice under the most
desired geisha in history, Hatsunaomo (Li Gong).
Chiyo is then rescued by Hatsumomc's bitter rival
Mamcha (Michelle Yuen) and transformed into the
renowned geisha Sayuri. The story takes place over
several years and encompasses pie-war, wartime and
post-war Japan.

For the most part, the three lead actresses, who
were coasters in Crone/ring Tiger Hid/{m Dragon, do a
good job, with Li Gong giving the most notable fe-
malc performance as the bitchy Harsuvnomo.

Yet there were two major problems. None of the
actresses were able to achieve the hypel'rfemmlnity
typical to geisha. Secondly, their accents are notJapa-
nest and are all different from each other. Michelle
Yuen has almost no detectable accent while Ziyi
Zhang has a very heavy one. It can get really dlSUACKT
ing and is a horrible consequence ofchoosing to shoot
the movie in English, This decision was just on: of
the many that really undermined the integrity ofthe
film.

The film makes so many compromises to appeal
to a Western audience. It picks and chooses aspects of
Japanese culture, leaving out anything that would be
challenging, such as the japanese language, and ims
posed Western ideals on the geishar Even the visual
style, while excellent, adds to this western idealism of
Japan.

In the end, Memoir; afa Gtirlm is not really a mov~
ie that takes place in Japan, but rather a movie that
takes place in the West’s romanticized Japan.
