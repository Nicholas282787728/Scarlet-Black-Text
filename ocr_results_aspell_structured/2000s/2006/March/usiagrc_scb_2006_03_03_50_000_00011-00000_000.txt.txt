Taking a ride in Turkey

In Ankara, the best way to get around the city is
not by car or bus, but by dolmus. A dolmus, a large
blue and white box on wheels, looks like a cross has
tween a van and a bus. Every dolmus has an estab-
lished route advertised in the window and costs the
same 1.2 YTL (approx. 5.90) to go anywhere from
three blocks to 10 miles.

Drivers wait at the beginning of their route un-
til the seats are packed as
tightly as possible and then
the vehicle takes off on
a rollcrcoaster ride coins
plete with sWift weaving
through traﬂ‘ic, multiple
near-accidents and sudden
stops.

Aside from supplying an adrenaline rush and
a convenient way to reach my language courses in
the city, the dolmus' is my favorite
place to observe Turkish culture.

On my ﬁrst ride, I was stunned by We from Wily/Hg an
the seemingly haphazard payment amend/me [US/l

process.

Every passengﬂ simply passes is my favorite plateto observe

money forward through other peo—
ple until it reaches a driver some-
how capable of simultaneously
maneuvering through trafﬂc, talking and counting
change. In the last ﬂve weeks, i have yet to witness
somebody neglect to pay the driver or fail to receive
the proper change back from the front ofthe dolmus.
It is a simple and antiquated system based on a trust
that I am ashamed to say thutjust doesn't exist in the
United States anymore,

After paying my fare I can relax in my seat and
take a few moments to both observe the people shat—
ing the short journey with me and survey the world
quickly passing by our the window.

Within the dolmus I am typically surrounded by
a mot of Westen‘iized young professionals, starved
and unscarvcd women old men with tespih (Muslim
prayer beads) in hand, teen boys with greased mnllets
and pointed boots and migrants recently arrived from
villages.

I am perplexed at the way the secular Turks, Suns
nis, Shiites, Alcvis, Kurds and obvious foreigners like
me come together in such a peaceful manner for a
few glorious city blocks. Sometimes people talk, but
mostly we all sit quietly looking at each other until
somebody cries, “Inecek var!" and the vehicle veers to
the side ofthe road to let them off.

The microcosm ofethnicity in the dolmus shrinks
in comparison to the macroeosm ofdiversity ﬂying by
outside the window. Every other block here in Ankara
has a unique personality, and we ﬂy from modern ut-

Iurklih (ii/lure.

ban areas to shanty homes in a few minutes.

The skyline in the distance is littered with build
ings painted in bright blues, pinks and purples, and
in between apartment complexes mosque minarets
pierce the clouds. Finally, the city is dotted with state
ucs of Ataturk, the mustached hero of this young, sec~
ular Republic.These tributes are a constant reminder
of the fervent nationalism and fierce dedication to
democracy (or some form
of it) that has character—
ized much of the country,
particularly the military,
since the founding of the
Republic in the 19205.

Upon arriving back at
the Middle Eastern Techs
nical University after langniage classes in the city, the
Jandarma (military police) who guard campus board

the dolmus for mandatory ID
checks.

By this time,any scarved women
have replaced their beautiful silks
with wool hats because scarves are
banned in public buildings, includ
ing state universities. While I've
gotten used to the armed guard at
the gate,I sometimes wonder if the
same smiling, middle»agcd man checking IDs will
turn out in riot gear when the Communist student
group decides to protest a visit from Ross Wilson,
U.S. ambassador to Turkey

With a nod from the guard, the dolmus driver
makes his way through the immense campus to the
mallrlike food court and eventually the stop outside
my dormitory.

ltit is the right time of day, I may very well exit
my dolmus and head toward my room listening to
the Call to Prayer from a mosque in the distance and
might get handed some political activism leaﬂet along
the way

To a newcomer, society here is seemingly nonsenz
sical and chaotic. The people here exist in a multitude
of different worlds, many of which appear incompat-
ible. Turkey is an Islamic country that bans head?
carves, a secular nation with a statezcontrolled DireCz
torate of Religion, an EU candidate whcie much of
the domestic commerce exists in local pazars, and the
only placc wherc you will find devout Muslims hangs
ing portraits of the Greek born Atatiirk who secular
ized Turkey and ended the Caliphate.

In my sixth week here, I am finally starting to rec-
ognize the beautiful ways in which all of these pecue
liar aspects ofTurkish life blend to create a bewildere
ing but exquisite civilization that still has not quite
found its place in the world.

Student proteSt weak

Last November, Grinnell assistant librarian
Christine “Chris"Gaunt was arrested trespassing on
military property during a School of the Americas
pI‘OEESL While some 0 us on the Scarlet 8 Black
staff disagree with Gaunts politics, we all admire
her conviction, she stood by her actions and risked
her livelihood for a e-iuse. Last time we checked,
this was the heart of politiC'Il _
protest.

In stark contrast, four
Grinnell students who were
arrested taking part in a Free
the Planet (FTP) protest on?
side a Victoria's Secret store in
Des Moines are not standing »
up for their cause. Rather than trying to publicize
their arrest to bring attention to the Victoria’s Secret
practices that they disagreed with so vocally, these
students tried to keep even their names, not to men-
tion their stories, out of the media.

We question these students’ commitment to a
cause they abandon when they get in trouble W hen
provided the opportunity to spread their message to
the Grinncll community, they heeded the advice of
their lawyer and declined to speak to the paper.

Have student protests at Grinncll hecomc norhr
ing more than empty rituals that are abandoned the
second they may pose threat to grad school a pplica-
tions or job lnecrviews>_ brave the day-.- passed uhen

Grinnellians chained themselves to Office Depot to
promote recycling despite the consequences?

When Gaunt showed it in court and pled guilty
last November, she knew s e was risldng a lotdat
least six months of freedom and at most her job at
the college

Vi’hen student protesters handed a dozen roses

to i clerk working the Victo—

rias Secret counter, they likely

thought their actions were

harmless. When their actions

provoked a ridiculous arrest

editorial and ‘tl dramatic episode spati—

t.‘_ mug several hours, they had

an opportunity to call atterr

tion to the cause of old-growth wood with several
press outlets, including this one, ready to relay their '

story. When faced with the steely gaze of the law,

the four Fiee the Planeteers sacriﬁced their cause to

preserve their clean records, hoping that their arrest

would magically disappear without a paper trail.

Grinnell College was once known for it studcnts'
commitment to direct action on behalfof the causes
that they truly believed in. Now it seems that :ui elf»
icriioon outing to a local mall is the only protest that
we are willing to trouble ourselves with, and even
then u v if there are no consequences for making a
seen Still, it nice to know that the libmiy stiitfis
