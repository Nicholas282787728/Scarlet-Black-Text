Something flShy In the Mlddle East moIIInIIIIts

The Squid and the
Whale (R)

Despite steep competition, lec
Squid mid (/Jt‘ Wth/c, written and die
rected by Noah Baumbach (writer fol
Toe Lye Agni/(lit mm, Sm” Zirmzl), is
easily one of the most interesting, efr
fective and enjoyable films I saw in the»
atcis last year. Writing largely from his
own childhood experiences Baulnbaclt
tells the storv of a family divided bv
divorce. In telling this story, the ﬁlm
succeeds excellently in every aspect and
effectively entertains, urnuscs, disturbs
and provokes the viewer.

While the ramilydepicted is far from
normal, even by modern standards, the
characterizations and situations char
acters ﬁnd themselves feel very real, as
well as being very funny. Though the
film’s interactions frequently border on
being painfully awkward, they succeed
at creating empathy with characters
while simultaneously laughing at them.
These situations range from simple
dating uneasiness to smearing ejaculate
on the spines of library books. Because
it avoids the common formulas of a
family tragedy or teelrgood comedy,
the film’s characters experience growth
without redeeming their ﬂaws or find»
ing real solutions to their crises. As
a result, the characters seem to be far
more real than other characters found
on screen.

Although the acting is superb in
every role (even that of Billy Baldwin),
Jeff Daniels and his impressive beard
deliver a surprisingly strong perfor-
mance. As the once lauded author and
now failing father, Daniels is arrogant,
pathetic, loathsome and sympathetic,
While these words could just as easily
describe his character from Dumb and
Dumber, the contrast between perforr
mances is astounding, And fortunately,
the rest of the cast easily matches him.

Equally effective is the overall vi»
sual style. The ﬁlm has a warm, grainy
quality, and is shot in a subtle naturals
istic style. Combined with run-down,
Brooklyn locations, this helps to bring
an overall level of gritty realism to the
film which helps to reinforce the sense
of this being a real family, maybe like
the family your best friend had ngr
mg up.

overall, this ideosynchratic “corn-
edy" is one of the best ﬁlms released
last year.

The story loosely focuses on an
unidentiﬁed Arab country whose ag-
ing Emir must decide which of his two
sons will replace him, and a proposed
merger by American oil giants that
comes under fire from the Justice De-
panmentt

What looks to be a promising tale of
political intrigue is soon lost in a mud-
dle of names and faces as we arejerked
from one subplot to the next. What
makes this more frustrating is the obvi—
ous dramatic potential of some of the
storylines, propelled by an outstanding
ensemble cast. George Clooney, who
infamously gained 35 pounds {or the
role, puts in a solid performance as Bob
Barnes, a seasoned CIA operative who

finds himselfa pawn offorces he barely
understands. Wasim Ahmed Khan
(Mazhar Munir) is especially poignant
as a disillusioned oil worker who begins
attending a radical Muslim madrassa,
where he is befriended by a manipu—
lative Egyptian. But at the breakneck
speed rhat every story unfolds, we never
get the chance to delve beyond the sur
face of any character.

Syriam doesn't provide any easy an-
swers,but the real problem is that we've
barely had a chance to figure out the
questions. Ifyou like political intrigue
or enjoy good acting for the sake of
good acting, it’s worth watching. Just
bring a friend who doesn’t mind ques—
tions.
