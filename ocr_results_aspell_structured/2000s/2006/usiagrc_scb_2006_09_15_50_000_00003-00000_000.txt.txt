Joint Board elections feature mixed voter turnout

av TRVMDRE MAcoMANA & BEN WEYL
Last week's Joint Board election brought some surprising
results on the surface, but upon closer examination followed
trends from recent years.
Though no cluster was without a candidate, some races
were more compcririvc than others. The senate race In the

no one ran in Read,James, Loose or East Hall.

To an extent, voter turnout mirrored competitiveness. A
mere 42 percent of Smilh-Younlter residents voted for the two
candidates who were running unopposed, and only 53 percent
of East residents voted for their unopposed senators. Turnout
was greatest In the competitive race to represent Cowlcs-Dib»

Smitthounkcr clusrcr, for example, had only bleeNorris students, boasting a turnout om
two candidates running for two spots. SGA percent.AtIny28 percent ofoffrcampus smr
Adminisrrarivc Coordinaror Nick Blencowe News AnalySIs dents voted for their senators, dcspirc having

'08 said that SGA had to scramble to get both
of those spots filled. The cluster for East also saw three can-
didatcs running for only three spots. On Inc who hand, Ihc
clusters for ClarkaateseLanganeRawson, and Loosechade
Haines both saw five serious candidates in the running.
Senator recruitment has been generally strong in recent
years and is certainly a marked improvement from 2003.That
fall, then-SGA President Liz Allen ’04 and then Vice President
Devan Mchnahnn ’04 held an emergency meeting, In which
rhcy wcrc torccd Io makc scvcn scnaiorial appointments after

a very competitive met: that was forced into
a run-off. One possible factoI is that students studying abroad
are included on tho off-campus studcnts list, and may not be as
able to vote or interested in the results as students in Grinnell.
Many students living in town also lack intornct access in their
homes and would have less access to the online “polls.”Another
possible factor could be senior "malaise."
Some students also expressed surprise that two write-iii
candidatesiKirby Ramstad '08 and Katie Battani '09—were
elected, but it is not without precedent in the fall onOUS, Kat

Henry '06 and Nora Skelly ’08 won as writeein candidates.

Former SGA Administrative Coordinator Megan Gocr-
Ing ’08 suggested that writeein candidates can do well bccausc
rhcy arc torccd to put more effort Into their candidaciesI “The
hard part ofbeing the writerin candidate is rhar you don't have
rhc automatic admntagc ofbe‘mg on the ballot," Goering said,
“This can also be a blessing In disguise as it encourages and roe
ally requires write-in candidates to devote extra energy to their
campaign through posrcring, rhrough doorrtordoor campaigns
ing and Ihrough word-ot-mouth."

Both Ramssad and Barrani said they uscd those strategies
to earn votes “I campaigned [door-to-door] two days straight,
and I put up my statement ofintent in every bathroom stall and
on my plan," Ramsrad wrorc in an e-mail.

Battam followed the same srmtcgy After missing the applir
cation deadline, she used the delay ofthc Iiccrion to campaign
in the bathrooms and dooretoedoor. Even after this, Battani
said shc was surprised (hat she won. “I figured it would be very
difficult to get people to write my name in,"Battani said.

Candidates disagree on social issues

Election, cont. from p. l

knorkcd on over 3,500 doors to ask what votr
ers care about most. “I didn’t hear about social
issues," Palmer said. “What I heard about is,
‘1 just lost health care, and I can’t afford the
premiums.’wc'rc bankrupt because of health
caro'rhat's gor Io bc onc ofthe mosr simplc
concerns."

Carroll thinks that health care costs will
go down if the legislature protects physicians
from “frivolous" lawsuits “A lot of medicine
today is defensive," he said, “Physicians ordcr
tests or do procedures that they might not
otherwise do because rhcy donr want Io bc in
court. That drives up the cost."

Economy

Both candidarcs support using tax crcdirs

to spur economic growth. Carroll suggested

that the government use tax credits to "notjust
hire more workers but to provide opportunie
tics for workers ro improve their skills and
get better training.”

Palmer thinks rhc key Issue is making sure
that businesses are held accountable for the
benefits they receive. “You‘ve got to go In there,
and really opcn rhc books, and make sure they
rcally arc crcating jobs," said Palmcr. “There
ought to bc ovcrsighr to accomplish these
goals, nor just making big promises and taking
our money.

Energy

Both Carroll and Palmer are enthusiasr
ric supportcrs of crhanoi and bio-diesel fuels,
including giving sraIc subsidies to those who
manufacture them.

They also borh agrcc that wind energy has
an important role to play in Iowa's cconomy

and rhat thI state should promote it. “We can
try to get Iowans on the cutting edge with
mud," said Palmcr. "Iowa is third place in the
nation right now in wind power.”

Carroll was similarly enthusiastic about
Iowns poIcnIiaI for wind power. lryou vc ever
Iravclcd up [Io Norrhwcstcrn Iowa], its just
hug ewindmills, wind farms, said Carroll.
Social issues

Carroll has srrong feelings against abortion
and gay marriage. “I believe that an unborn
child is a human life and ii dcscrvcs protcction
under the law," said Carroll. "It doesn’t seem
unreasonable, but yet reasonablc pcoplc havc
found a way to disagrcc."

He is equally ﬁrm on rho question of gay
marriage. "I think that it is in Ihc bcst inrerest
of Iowa and our society rhar wc rcscrvc mar-
tinge as between one man and onc woman,"

Carroll said. Carroll also said that he opposcs
civil unions for gay couples.

Palmer supports abortion rights and civil
unions between gay couples, but he declined
to talk about What he rcnncd divisive tops
ics. It bothers me. .whcn you cantvisit your
Signiﬁcant orlicr iii rhc hospital because you re
not married," said Palmer “1 would be inter—
ested In orploring rhc issue. I’m an elder in my
church, so morality is very important. At the
same time, i don’t want a state-imposed mov
rality, and l don'I mm to impose my morality
on you,"

Carroll believes that his politics aren’t out
of the mainstream for Republicans, and asked
thar even predominantly liberal Grinncll Col-
lege hear him out. “Don’t just eliminate inc
from your consideration just because I’m a
Republican."
