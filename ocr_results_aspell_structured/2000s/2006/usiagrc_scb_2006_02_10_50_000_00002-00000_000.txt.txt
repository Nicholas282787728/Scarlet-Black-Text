College hopes to improve
recycling for contest

Counting calories will be out and counting garbage
in for 2006, if Environmental and Safety Coordinae
ror Jennifer Jordan has her way. Grinnell has entered
the RecycleMania contest for the second straight year,
and hopes to improve its performance in the three
categories tracked: most amount of recyclables, least
amount oftrash, and highest recycling rate.

The contest began on January 29 and ends April
8. Grinnell is competing against 93 colleges and uni-
versities this year, and will recycle from dorms, the
dining halls, academic buildings, and offices. All the
trash and recyclables from campus buildings will be
weighed over the course of the contest.

In an all-campus e-mail exhorting students to sup
port the campaign, Jordan asked students to simply
take a moment to think before throwing something
in die trash. “Can it be Ie-Used? Can it be recycled?"
Jordan wrote. .

Lasr year, Grinnell entered only the recycling
amount contest and placed 31 out of 34 schools. For
Free the Planet (FTP) co-leader Allison Arnphlett
'05, that wasn't enough.

“It's really shameful," she said. “Grinnell is seen as
a really progressive place, so to fall really far behind
against‘other schools nationally is sad] hope we do
better this year." '
