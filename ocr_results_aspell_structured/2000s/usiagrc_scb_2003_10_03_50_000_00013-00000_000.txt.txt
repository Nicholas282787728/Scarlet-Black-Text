girl? in rhe ﬁrst place, one could be forglvcll for thinking
rhar rhere aren'r any sporrs fans ar Grinnell. And although
only rhree oirhe rcn lounges sampled were warehing game

supporrers. Secondly. many
were probably of rhe opinion
rhar rhrs srory would never be

years larer and rhey are srill sirring on rhose two

numerous times (lasr appearance: 1998, when rhey were
swept by the Braves in rhe NLDS). yer somerhing lust ale

The Cubs do have quit: rhe following, any baseball
fan can rell you that. After rhnrslighrlysueeesshal New York
