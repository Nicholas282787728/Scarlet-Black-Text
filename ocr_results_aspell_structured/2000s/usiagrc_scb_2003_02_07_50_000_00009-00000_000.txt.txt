Making Plans

Through no other medium, however, do Grinnell students
express themselves with such lrcqucncy and volume as they
do on Plan;

Roughly 1300 Plans exist, most otwliich belong to

Students here in the past disrpprovod otprotessois or
administrators reading Plans. “It strikes me as a peculiar
attitude," said John Stone, Computer Science, who angle
iinlly became interested in rho software Plnns operator on.
Sronc is one or few professors to have a Plan and one of
even fewer who admits he tends student Plans.

As a computer scientist, stone was interested in Plan
technology long before Plains became a campus-wide mag.

Grinncll is not the only college with Plans. North Caro.
