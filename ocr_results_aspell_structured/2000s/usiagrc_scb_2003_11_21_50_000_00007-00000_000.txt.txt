Some ofrhcse games involved a character called

Georgia Guitar Quartet
Saturday, Nov. 22

9.30 pm. Harris Concert Hall
Doors open at 9 pm.

This Friday, Concert Chair John Chavez said
to expect classical guitar music with "an edgy,
younger twist."

The Georgia Guitar Quartet started playing
together in 1956, when Kyle Dawkins, Brian
Smith, Phil Snyder and Jason Solomon met at
school in Athens, where they were majoring in
classical guitar.

~Our teacher, John Sutherland suggested
that we try playing together," said Phil Snyder,
”We’ve been friends ever since,”

The group, according to Snyder, "is a chssical
guitar quartet, meaning we phy chssicalguitars
(with nylon strings instead of steel), but our
concerts have a lot more to offer than other
’classical’ music concerts.”

They try to appealto a wider audience than
other classical music artists. "True, we do play
what most people term as 'classicar music, or
Art Music," said Snyder. “but We always present
it in such a way that anyhody can feel
comfortable and enjoy our concerts, not just
classical music fans."

”The Quartet performs with good energy and
technique, applies careful attentinn'to detail
and maintains a diverse repertoire,” said guitar
great Christopher Parkcning.

James Kissane, a former Grinnell professor,
whu is now living in Georgia, is largely
responsible for the group’s visit,

According to Concerts Chair, John Chavez '05,
”Mr Kissane is paying to ily the group here
and is aho covering their performancs fee!”

Phil Snyder of the Georgia Guitar Quartet
promises that their progmn will be “eclectic"

Among the pieces that will he featured in
Friday's Show are a traditional Irish dancer
selections from Ravel’s-“Mother Goose Suite,"
a Chopin piece, a three-movement work by
Darius Milhaud called "Scaramauche," two
original compositions by two of their members
and a version of “Linus and Lucy” from the
Charlie Brown cartoons.

The group will host a master class in the
Forum North Lounge at 7:00 later this evening.
It will be a chance for people to ”bring
their guitars, play with the group, ask any
questions, and just have a good time on a Friday
night,” said Chavez.
