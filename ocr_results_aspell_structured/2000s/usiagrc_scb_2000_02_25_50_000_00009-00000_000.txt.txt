(Grinnell) Despite the snow
and cold, the Grinnell Productions
Studio on Commercial Street was
standing-room only last Friday
night for the opening of Freestyle,
the company’s new weekly “open-
stage» performance night. More
than 45 people filled the Studio to
see ten performers from through»
out the community, including Bill
Rudolph (GrinnelLNewbul-g High
School English teacher); Valerie
Arnold, Joni Carroll, April Kamp,
Sophie Kasimow, and Val Miller
(Grinnell-Newburg High School
students), and Pip Gordon
(Grinnell faculty),

“We were not sure what kind of
turn-out to expect, but we were
very pleased when we had to add
additional seating to accommodate
I16 audience" said Scott Ihrig, a
Grinncll Productions board mem—
ber, “The audience really liked
Freertyle and many of them
t1anl<cd us afterwards for doing
't.” Freestyle is an “opcmstagc”
per ormance event where anyone

can sign-up to perform whatever
racy want. There are only a few

sim )lc rulcswall ofwhich are part
of (as shtick at the beginning of
each Frenzy/la. Rule number one
is: There Are No Rules (except
tacsc, ofcourse) Performers have
five minutes to do their thingi
but ongcr acts can sometimes get
more time, Performers must keep
t1cir acts clean because—as the
rule gocsi‘ﬁfter all, this is a fam—
i y snow,” And to perform, you
have to sigmup at the Freestyle the
Friday before, or call the Grinnell
Proc uctions’ office at

236—3203.

 

 

Freesgyle is every Friday night at
9:00 pm. at the Grinnell Produc—
tions Studio on Commercial: look
for the yellow door on Commer-
cial Street. Performers get in free,
everyone else pays $2.
