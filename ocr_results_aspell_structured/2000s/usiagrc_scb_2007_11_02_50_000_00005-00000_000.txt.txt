Descend into horror movies at Harris this weekend

The Descent
(2 005)

Horror movie gory but good

Horror movres are abundant this time of
year, usually consisting of the overly grotesque
and the continually boring. But T122 Dutml
offers respite from the usual Sll‘w and Eli Roth
contributions to the holiday and instea'd deliw
ers a story both gory and genuinely frightens
rn .
gAs predictable as the setup seems, it offers
enough background on the characters to get
the audience to actually care about their sulr
vivnl. sot women head off to the Appalachians
on their annual thrill-seeking adventure to
explore a cave within the mountains. one of
the women decides to lead the group into an
unexplored cave and “forgets” to bring rhe map
along. A cave—in ensues, and rhe women are
forced to and another way our.

The journey out ofthc cave is fraught with
long, clausrrophobiaeinducirrg struggles that
often leave you as scared as the character push-

blackness is omnipresent, with often only a
patch of light letting you know what is hap-

ants, a group of “Gollum goneewrongs” who
terrorize the troupe as they lose both their
hope and their way while deseending further

The movie does run into a few ﬂaws as
it progresses. Of the six women who set out
for the cave, only two or three retain any im—
portance, the rest basically there to fulﬁll the
role of any genetic extra in a horror movie.

is less than plausible. It would have been better
if the ﬁlmmakers had just chosen to leave their
background more ambiguous.

While it is true that continuous gore marks
the latter half of the ﬁlm, motiwrted characters
