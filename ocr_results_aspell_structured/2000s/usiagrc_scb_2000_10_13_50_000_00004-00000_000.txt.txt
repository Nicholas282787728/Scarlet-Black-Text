It is time for you to
get a plan. And 1 am
not talking about the
kind or plan that your
parents are always
bothenng you to get
when they are not
bothering you to
straighten up your
pnonnes

Plans are hard to
explain. A plan is a
place for you to write
anything you want.
Some people change
their plans almost
everyday, while other
people don't. Some
people usetheir plan as
a public diary, others
use it as a soapbox. It
can be accessed (or
”fingered”) by anyone
else on campus who has
a plan. Plans went
extinct last year when
the VAX was shut down.
If you don‘t really
understand what the
VAX is, ask an
upperclassman, and they
will say, ”Oh, how I miss
the VAX!" and not
answer your questions.

Anyway, plans are
wonderful. with a plan.
you can write down your
deepest, dearest
thoughts and hope that
your crush reads them
and realizes that even
though you are not the
best looking person, you
have a stellar
personality and are
worth sleeping with, or
at least worth not
ignoring completely.
ALso, you can stalk your
crush without having to
leave the comfort of
your chair to climb that
tree again.

Or. if you have
suspicions that someone
you know is completely
normal, you can go read
their plan and become
quickly disillusioned.
believe me, that nice
quiet boy in your anthro
class is a bit stranger
than you would
imagine.

Also, many plans are
very, very runny. For
examples, hnger Fred
Beukema's plan
[BEUKEMA], which is at
the moment, entirely in
haiku form. Randomly
ﬁngering people is a
wonderful
procrastination
technigue, especially if
you have already
exhausted other
options, such as wn'ting
To Do lists or going to
Southern and looking at
the food even though
you don‘t have any
money. .

So get a plan today,
and start ﬁngering!
Then tell all or your
fn'ends to get plans.
The more people that
have plans, the more
fun it is.

To get a plan, email
heckr@gnnnell.edu and
tell her that you want
one, .
