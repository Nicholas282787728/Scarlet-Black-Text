Trimming
costs at PEC

Physical Education Complex cut staff and
hours for cost efﬁciency, says athletics director

by J e n W a l s h
Features Editor

PEC weight room hours was cut this you in an attempt K) be “cast
cmoionr" and due to shirt poropnuns of low usage nr ccrnin nrnos ufdzty,
said Dee Faii'child, Director ofAthletics

“I'm not down [in the weight room] ten hours a day," Fairchild said
Therefore. Fairchild relics partially on the (open: on im Hollthaugh, Physr.
cal Edumtlum who has an ofﬁce in the weight room,

“He said the weight loom wasn't used [at certain times]," Fair-child
said. “So we cut hours. I was trying to be cost efﬁcient, that's all. .. It’s not
r budget issue."

Some houis were added back to the weight room schedule after classes
stat ted this year, and F:tilCilild Mid the eunent hours ate “not that differ-
ent. . from hsr year. We
didn't take very many hours
away The weight room is
still open eight ro 12 hours
n day. Any person who
wants to use [the weight
room] can fit the time in
with the current schedule."
Ths weight room is cup
teiitly opsn 4.5 hours less
than it was hsr year.

Faitchild hopes ro get
word of mouth feedback if
users Feel the weight room
should be open at driroronr
limﬁ. “It'd have to be more than one student [who wanted it open]," she
said. “And we might cut different [times] so we’re not adding, houis "

At the end ofthis semtstcl, Faitchild plans to talk ro Hollibaiigh ro got
his Estimate ofweight room usage at various times Theie nrc no pins to
(hang: the weight room schedule for next semester at this time, Fairehild
said,

People using the weight room should sign in, FJH'Clllld said, as the
srpnan shssr is the pnmnry way weight mum usage is monitored. “1r mn
only help them." she said. “It tells us what the true usage is."

Last year, there was a monitor npsmrs m the PEC. in addition ro
monnors in the weight room ind equipment room. “We just drdn‘r need
all those people," Faitchild Said. “They did their homework and siepr."
The monitor in the weight room now Walks mound the building to moni-
lot both the weight room and the upsmrs area.

Weight room hours can change unexpectedly when these monitors
don'r show up. “We won’t open rhs weight room without a monitor,“
Fairchild said. “We depend on these students." Fairchild said she hasn't
heard ofany major problems with monitors not showing up,

Fairchild said it’s difficult to tell how the availability ofGtinnell’s ath-
letic norhni—s Compares to the availability offacilities at the oonsges peer
insrirurions. Fairchild hso not speciﬁcally examined the hours of opera—
tion of weight rooms at these past institutions, she said, but she has done
several external reviews.

Ftom looking at the schedules posted at these schools, Faitchtld said,
“We’re very comparable ro, iinor better than, our peer insrirunons."

“We try to be u flexible and convenient as we can," she said.

We re very comparable
to, if not better than, our
peer institutions. We try
to be as flexible and
convenient as we can."
