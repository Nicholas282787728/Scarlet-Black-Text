Stunned by
the Stars

by Bradley lverson-Lcng & Kay Nguyen

Bradley: For spring break. I recommend that you find ycurstlfa job,
an internship or t sexual partner. Thar way you’ll have something mean-
ingful to do over the summer. But ifyoii strike out there, movie thunrrcs
will almys let you in, For $8.50 plus parking and popcorn, Harris, I'm
gonna miss you.

Before we preview soinc spring movies, a bit orspring cleaning A
recent random ranier wrote some rankling remarks about our reviewing
repertoire. Said mnttr attributed Kay and l as saying "'lve not seen this
movie yct. You can find out riboiit it when you see it.” Now. I don't want
to bring excessive attention to his opinion, (l‘d mtlier bring attention to
opinion Editor Emily B. Anderson's intriguing Biocoinpuotion major,
which, by completing in only 3 years, makes all ofiis look foolish, and not
bemus: we havcn't Sun a couple of movies) but I would like to assum our
nudicnc: that w: will never write such short, boring scntcnczs as “I've not
seen this movie yet." Instmd, we'll cover up our ignorance with babble,
doublcspcnk and bullshit,

Kay: Also, in the interest of full disclosure and our reputation, you
should know that we donr have the perks cfmaior movie reviewers We
dont get complementary tickers, like David Denby and has Reed, but we
go through $Irenuous legal and illegal means to see the Harris movies,
which we see at least hnlfoh We also donr have college degrees, like Roger
Ebert or Elvis Mitchell Or archy names that start with: “ ”

Opening in theatres:

Br I want to point out that “We’ve not seen these movies yet,” But
then, no one in America has, so I hope you'll forgive us.

K: My role of thumb in picking the right movie to watch when you
are in Vietnam and the only availabl: info about a ﬁlm is‘ th: star power.
Look at the star power!

Yeah, throughout the pr:»lntcrnet years back home, I have accumUv
lated a detailed list of actors who can clcar away every {car efmiiie about
potential dtmtrial disasters rharwreck both my good mood and my pocket.
These fiv: films are that: that l have minimal rescrvation [D recommend,
all chosen based on my list of aciors.

Secret Vlﬁndow (PG-13)- Johnny Depp

Want to fathom the depths of Johnny Depp? Check out this versatile
g:mus in his latest movie, rcleased today! Aspuokyfllm version ofstephen
King's bestseller, Stat! W/indaw features a writer Witnessing his thriller
novel come to life only to claim his life,

Spartan (R)- Val Kilmer

up ‘till now, Hollywood dudes have cithaustcd every imaginable plot,
which includes the worn—out [rackingrdawnchlgh-mad-omur’s-dzug‘ilcr
plot. But I’m sure val Kilmcr can make a difference, and so can director/
screenwriter David Mamet. Opens today.

The Ladykillers (R)- Tom Hanks

Tom Hanks and hrs robber band actually plan to kill their landlady
after she finds out that those musical gentler-nan downstairs arc only interr

B: I’ll throw in a couple movies that you should catch in theatres due
largely to rhc phenomenal screenwriters. Who needs celebrity cults when
you can fawn over a dude at a typewriter?

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind- (R)- Charlie
Kaufman
Who's Chzrlie Kaufman? He’s the smartbutslighdyaddlcd man who
penned Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and confessions ofa Danger-
ous Mind. His latest head-smtchcr stars Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Eliiah
Wood and Kirsten Dunst, and is dirccrod by Michael Gondry, who made
some cool ijrk music vidzos. The plot is classic Kaufman: Carrcy and
Winslet are romantically cngaged, but bad memories of their coupicdom
weigh down their future. so they get them erased. It's called science 1‘10
tion, folks. No, I don't really understand it either. But I really want to see
it. Opens March 19.

Jersey Girl (PG-13)- Kevin Smith

Yes, Kevin Smith, stoner auteur, has made a PG-13 movie. Jersey Girl
is the last vestige of the Bennifer behemoth, although most of this family
film is about Amecks intemcrions with thtir cute 7-year-old daughter
(Raquel Castro). The internet buzz is very high on this movie, and, as Jay
and Silent Bob strikes Back will tell you, that counts for a lot,Trusr inc,
it’ll be berm than Gigli. Opens March 26.

Looking at Babys ﬁrst steps

A young, creatively-cladcast pulls off a humorous and enjoyable musical with limited funds

When the lighn over the Herrick pews dimmed and a warm glow
ﬂooded the makeshift stage, I was struck by the productions crcatlvlty
and resourcefulness. Isettlcd in to watch the actors, both familiar and new
to me, as they opened the show. Th: choice oinerrick chapel, the creep.
tional costumes and the discovery offrcsh singing talent were truly worth
the trip to Bitty last weekend. I caught sight ofthc way GIMP (Grinnell
independent Musical Productions) managed to produce a musicil with
such commend ofrheirlimited resources and genuinely :njoycd the quirky
plot line.

In general, the singers seemed to have a good sense of harmony and
tone.

Elcnzt Rubin ‘07 sent her gentle voice soiling confidently, wen—schooled
soprano Emily scholreii ‘06 was right on the mark and Laura Mint ‘07
pushed hergursy conttnlto voitc beyond the sound ofthe bandTlic men
were equally unique, with David Churchinrn ‘07 resonating in a particu-
larly pleasing way opposite scholtcii, who played his wife in the show,

The ensemble members of the cur were surprisingly Inlenrcdgcspc-
cinliy the vocal creativiiy Laura l<irk ‘07 give to her roles niid the spotless
comedic timing of Tyler stokes ‘07, who plays the OB/GYN with dis.
rrcssing eye problems. Nor to mciition that both the ensemble and int
principal charnctcis wcrc quite attractive, making for n delightful show to
watch.

Tho technicil highlight or the show was the rnitnmt- dcsigii by Elizar

sonallties and occupations. The costumes of the older couple, “Alan” and
”Arlene," were especially remarkable, with Alan's argyieswearer and match
ing (it and Arlenc's multitude of frumpy, flowery dresses.

Directoriaily, the actors could have sung toward the audience more
often rather than fact: the back wall, which was an issue during the second
and third songs. As for as movement goes, the lack of dancing can be
excused because choreographingsuch ashowwould havebeen sticky with
our cliche birthing sequenccs or sappy ballroom dancing during the love
songs.

The only aspect dintdampeiicd theaudlenm’s enjoymentwas the band,
which stayed together most of the time but rendered the singers almost
inaudible. When I went on Friday night, they figured out how to play
quieter onc: intermission was over, so I was much relieved to be able to
hear the singers in the second act However, it is unfortunate when much

However, when observing these theatrical growing print, it was clear

production process but who demonstrates that GIMP allows the oppor
