Grinnell community
offended by mailing

Political mailing released last week by the Iowa Republican Party portrayed
Grinnell College students as manipulators of state politics, initiating response
from students, faculty and staff as well as members of the community

av BROOKE LANDSDALE

Shortly before the Nov. 2 election, the Republican Party
of Iowa sent out a mailing likening Grinnell College students
voting in Iowa to senators Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton,
whose pictures appear on the front of the mailing. Though it
does not mention his name, it urged voters ofrhe 75th District
to support the Republican candidate for state representative
Danny Carroll.

Many people from the town and college reacted to the
mailing with shock and anger. Jeff Phelps ‘73, owner ofsaints
Rest, was shocked. “I was amazed by it,"he said,“It disenfrans
chiscs 1,400 people." Phelps inade copies of the mailing and
has been distributing it in his shop.

Tom Crady, vice president for Student Schiccs, said, “I was
immediately appalled by what I saw and the generalizations
made in the tlyer. I was upset and angry.”

Though the mailing targeted Democrats, those speaking
out against it span the political spectrum, College President
Russell Osgood is an Independent and has voted for candidates
from the Republican and Democratic Party. “I want to specifi-
cally say I was extremely disappointed with both Danny Car-
roll and with Eric Palmer's advertisements, both on TV. and in
print media," he said. “But I was particularly disappointed by
this mailing."

Phelps also mentioned several other community members
and business owners who were angered by the mailing, “I know
many good Republicans who are upset about it.”

Renata sancken ‘07 of the Student Campaign for Increased
Political Engagement (SCIPE) said that Republicans and
Democrats in the group were upset about the mailing. She said,
“As a multirparrisan group we did not like the implication that
all students are East Coast liberals."

Gordon canfield, mayor of Grinnell, is a Republican who
was also troubled by the mailing. “I've always thought that
there isn’t a separation between the college and the city," he
said. “were all part of the community, so it bothered me when
I first hcaid about it."

“It made me vcry happy that the office ofmayor ofGrinnell
is nonpartisan." he said,“Ho\v things are discussed and Ialkcd
about on the local level is nonpartisan,"

Speculation on the effect of the mailing varied. “I worry
that itwill leave people with negative stereotypes ofthe college
and the students," said crady. several other people upset by
the mailing also thought it would negatively affect townrgown
relations.

“I hope that college students recognize it’s an election
ploy. It does not represent feelings of people in the town," said
Phelps, but added that the relationship between the college and
the town “has improved quite a bit recently”

Canfield agreed that he has seen “very positive improve-
ment" in townsgown relations in the so years he has been in
Grinnell because people on both sides have reached out to one
another. He did not feel the mailing would affect the relations
ship between the community and thc college negatively. While
he acknowledged the significance or mailings like this one, he
said, in the long run us not important. It ll go away It 11 go
away bccause of the positive actions of people osgood also
expressed hope the mailing would not negatively afrect the i‘CT
lationsliip.

“I encourage people who are offended to write and let the
Republican Party know how they feel," said Crady.

similarly, Canfield said,“I would hope that the Roprescntm
tive and the students both would try to meet with each other
and discuss it."

Osgood also expressed that this was a good opportunity to
start communication. "First of all, I hope everyone who is oft
fended by this will write to the Republican Party and let them
know they need to set the record straight," he said. “Second,
I hope students will take this as an occasion to get to know
people on both sides ofthe divide."

In reaction to the mailing, Osgood has sent a letter to the
Iowa Republican Party. “I think they should set the record
straight, say they sent out something that was untrue about
where most of our students come from," he said.

Sancken said SCIPE plans to write letters to Carroll, the
Iowa Republican Party and the Des Moira Regain , The group
has also started an online petition. Mark Henry ‘05 and R07
bccca Miller ‘05, SGA president and vicerpresidcnt, also plan
to write a letter to be approved by Joint Boaid and have asked

Senators to talk to their constituents about it.

In addition to damaging town-gown relations,some believe
this mailing may also harm Carroll's tuture campaign errorrs. “I
voted for Carroll three out of the last four election cycles but
will never vote for him again, and I know several other people
who say the sainc,"said Phelps.

canficid has not spoken with Carroll yet, but did say that
ads like this one from both parties have caused him to question
his irty affiliation. I might Just ii y being an Independent for
a while, see how that goes, he said. But i haven't fully made
up my mind yet."

Carroll said he saw the ad for the first time yesterday morn—
ing during the rte/r iiitei-viciv. “I knew they were going to do i
mailing, but I didn’t see that [the ma ng] or approve it before
it was sent," he . However, when asked if he knew the nae
cure orrhe mailing and that it was directed at Grinnell College
before it was sent out, Carroll said,“ycs."

In defense of the mailing, Carroll asked. “Was it or was it
not a part of the Democrat Party strategy to recruit as many
Grinnell college students as possible so as to affect both state
and local elections in favor of the Democrat Party?” He ans
swercd himself by saying, “How can one, in good conscience,
suggest that the Republican Party not make some effort in re-
sponding to that strategy"

As to whether this mailing will affect his relationship with
the college community, cairoll said, “Not at all. The college
community is certainly familiar with political campaigns,” and
he discussed the negative mailings and television ads ofhis op-
ponent, However, ifciiri-oll decides to run for Iowa governor in
2005, a decision that he said he has not yet made, the mailing
could have repercussions for him.

Forum to change again
Forum, cont. from (1.1

rum generated general facultyconcern,"and that students were
"very dissatisﬁed with the closing of the Southern Express."

The current plan is a compromiseThough an initial aim of
the committee’s student contingent was the rccstablishmcnt of
Southern Express, said Hart, no Southern Expressesryle meal
equivalency has been planned for next semester. The movement
ofthe pool tables, he continued, is a “truly unfortunate conse
quence" of the desire to keep dining options centralized.

According to Dick Williams, director of dining scrviccs,
this centralized dining arrangement and the present Forum
configuration was designed to facilitate an easier transition into
the future Campus Center and to provide students With more
Dining Dollars.

Victoria Brown, History, a faculty member ofthc commit-
tee, emphasized that the committee did everything that it could
to avoid the eviction of the pool tables. “The Forum Coffees
house was considered a strong candidate for the express items,"
she said, “but what it came down to was the fact that fewer
organizations and people would be inconvenienced by a move
into the pool room ...The regular pool players have been wonr
derfully cooperative," she said,

A frequent attendant to the pool tables, Patrick McNeainey
’oo, thinks that the Forum changes will actually be a benefit
to pool players. Despite an inferior lighting situation for the
tables in North Lounge, Patrick said that the configuration “ale
lows players to have a bit more room." He also believes that less
of pool equipment will be broken since it will now have to be
checked out from the Forum desk.

Administrative members of the adshoc committee made
the final decision to (CTCOl'lﬁgul’e the Forum as planned, Stun
dent and faculty members of the ad-hoc committee said that
the committee's admi strative staff members, most notably
Williams and Vice President of College Services John Kalk‘
brenner, were initially reluctant to go forward with the schedr
uled restoration.

Brown believes that true progress with the Administration
began after the trustees came for a visit earlier this semester.
The first issue brought up by the trusteesbrown said,was how
the “Forum had turned into a truck stop."

On the downside, the changes will cost the college “lots
more money" since more start members will be required to
work more hours in order to accommodate the restored design,
said Williams,

Moyer, however, believes that the changes will serve both
students and staff in a more effective manner. “The benefits far
out weigh the costs, he said. There ivas a general consensus
that we had a big problem, and these changes will be well re-
ceived."

JB discusses appeal

Grlevance, cannf from ﬂ

After nearly an hour or contentious debate, the issue of
whether or not Election Board would actually hear the grievv
aiice came to a voteThe bylaws require that a simple majority
is required to have Election Board review the grievance. Six
senators voted that the grievance should be heard; three Senas
tors and Cabinet, which has our: vote, voted that it should not
be. There were six “abstain"vores. so Barnum and Johnshoy did
not get a simple majority ofthe votes.

overall, Maloney thought that the discussion was produv
rive. He has said that he would look into fixing aspects of Pioe
neerVVeb. “There was fault on both sides” he said. “I think [Joint
Board] was good and something good will come out ofit.”

“I thought we had a very good, spirited discussion about the
issue that was quite constiuctivc," said Barnum He expressed
dissatisfaction, though, that some members ofJoint Board voted
to uphold Election Board's dccision. “Those inembeis need to
realize that Grinnell is about ftiirricss,jusricc, and due piocess,
not screwing over the voters on racetious technicalities."

“[W]licn you get right down to it," Hirschey said, “the
companies that make the most money are the companies
that produce the products most valuable to society and, as a
consequence, have the resources to treat their employees well.
These are the sort of companies we look for. And, of course,
ifPhillip Morris was just as profitable without pushing cancer
sticks,we’d own it. But as it is,we don't."

Local newspapers have reported on the recent closing ora
Maytag plant in Galesbutg, Ill, and a restructuring ofa cons
tract with another plant in ncliiby Newton, Iowa, But as May
rag investors, l-lii-schcy said the group supported the decisions,
citing the company's second-quarter loss of 841,084,000.

Hirschey said, “We support management decisions to cut
jobs oi more manufacturing out of the country when these
decisions are necessary for a firm to iciniin competitive, This
does not incaii we do not support hiiing U 8. workers."
