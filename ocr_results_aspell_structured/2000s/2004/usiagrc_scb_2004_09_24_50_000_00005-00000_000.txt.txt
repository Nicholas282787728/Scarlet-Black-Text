Riding happy trails ,

Poweshiek and Jasper counties recently worked together to open the six-mile,
one-million~dollar Grinnell Area Recreation Trail (GART), which runs from Grinnell

to Rock Creek State Park. Plans for additional bike paths are in the works

BY KIRSTEN Ano

Iowa has a large biking history, with a plethora oftrails to ride
on and the Der Mame: Region’s Annual Great Bike Ride Across
lowa, when around 10,000 bicyclists from all over ride 500 miles
across the state. This history was continued when a group of Grinr
nell citizens joined Grinnell 2000, now called Imagine Grinnell,
and several other organizations to build a trail from Grinnell to

Rock Creek State Park.

Grinnell resident and former resident Ted Mueller and Bill
Molison, members ofa local biking club, initially considered build»
ing a 20rmile circular trail from Grinnell to the Jacob Krumm
Prairie Preserve, a nature park southwest of Grinnell.

However, the club decided a circular trail
would not be as practical as a trail that con-
nected Grinnell to Rock Creek State Park.They
thought a trail to Rock Creek would have more
potential to be connected to other trails through»
out Iowa. With such connections, people could
potentially bike from Des Moines to Cedar Rap—
ids through Grinnell.With this in mind, the idea
of constructing the Grinnell Area Recreation
Trail (CART), whlch ofﬁcially opened on Aug.
28, arose. .

The CART, which is built across county
lines, is unique. “This kind of cooperation be-
tween counties is difﬁcult to ﬁnd,” said Craig
Cooper oreikes To You, a bike shop in down-
town Grinnell.

“The Poweshiek and Jasper County Boards
of Supervisors didn’t always see eye to eye," said

' Bob Molsberry, chairman of the GART Coma
mittee.

The main controversy over the trail was re
latcd to funding. The sinmIle long trail cost
nearly one million dollars. Because the trail starts
in Grinnell, which is a pan of the Poweshiek
county, but goes into Jasper county for most of
its parh, there was conﬂict over who should pay
for the trail.

Also, Grinnell sits on the border ofPoweshick
County, meaning any beneﬁt Grinncll gains
economically from the trail will likely remain
concentrated in the Grinnell area and not easily
spread to the rest of the county,

The counties were nor the only ones who
helped pay for the trail. Along with local fund
raisers, the GART Committee was able to get

grants from the federal and state governments. Molison and state

legislator Dennis Black were instrumental in getting these grants
and also in working with the county boards. Grinnell College,
Grinnell State Bank, the Grinnell Tourism Group, the Maytag
Family Foundation, the City of Grinnell, the Jeleren Founda-
tion and the Claude Ahrens Foundation also contributed funds:
The trail was built in two segmenrs. Segment one was built

from behind Grinnell High School to the Poweshieerasper

This kind of coopera-
tion between counties
is difficult to find."

"when you ﬁnish, you feel
like you did something," said
Craig Cooper of Bikes to You. I
agreed

GART is difﬁcult, because it is
hilly. I rode on it on a Saturday
morning with a friend, and ifl
had gone by myself, I prob~
ably wouldn’t have ﬁnished it.
I am not a particularly athletic
person to begin with, so that
didn’t help

The trail is fairly broad
asphalt and is a nice ride, and
when you get to the top of the
hills, you can go down fast.

The views are great as well,—
you get to see a lot of beautiful
cornfields, grass and horses,
Rock Creek State Park is abo
really pretty, with a big lake.

county line. Segment two extends from the county line to Rock
Creek State Park. Permission was received from local land ownr
ers to build the trail on their land.Two bridges, made ofleftrover
marerials from other building projects, are also included in the

trail.

“Part of the attraction of a trail like the
GART is it can lead to a perrer local economy,"
said Molsbery The Root River Trail in Minne-
sota,built in former railroad beds and extremely
popular with bicyclists, revitalized the economy
by increasing tourism. Local businesses devel-
oped and increased in proﬁtability because of
this tourism. Theie is a possibility of similar
economic growth in Grinnell, Molsbery ber
lievesl

Groups are still working to plan future trails.
They hope to spread some of the wealth by exr
tending the trail to the east and the west and conr
necring it to other trails in Iowa, In this way, the
trail could run through orher areas ofPoweshiek
County, such as Malcolm and Brooklyn.

Local planners also want to connect the hire-
rior of the city ofGrinnell with bike paths said
Debra Martzahn, an assistant librarian at the
college, in a rcpott prepared for the city of Grin-
Hell in 2002. Potentially, there could be trails
running to connect all the parks to each other
and to other important places, such as Grinncll
College and local schools. Imagine Grinnell, lor
cared in the Merchants National Bank, has maps
available for anyone who would like to suggest
where the trails should run.

The GART is not the only trail in the
Grinncll Areal Other trails run through Grin-
nell itself, on East Street, Brh Avenue, Penrose,
Washington, 1st Avenue, 4th Avenue and 11th
Avenue. There are trails outside of Gtinnell as
well, and Bikes to You has maps with these trails
marked out.
