Victoria's Secret protesters
get early escort out by police

BY DAVID MONTGOMERY

They didn’t expect the protest to
last very long, but members of Free
The Planet (FTP) were still surprised
at how quickly police ended their dem-
onstration against Victoria's Secret.
Twelve Grinnell students drove down
to the MerlerHay Mall in Des Moines
on Dec. 2 to draw attention to the lin-
gerie retailer's use of nonrrecycled par
per in its catalogs.

When FTP showed up at Victoria’s
Secret, Des Moines city police were
waiting, said protest organizer Jess Ea~
ton ‘07. “We thought
maybe once we at—
rived, the Victoria’s

premises, continu-
ing to chant slogans
as they went.

"We knew they were going to make
us leave as soon as we got disruptive,"
said protester Eric Husted ‘08. “But it
seemed like they knew we were com»
ing." Husted thought that since the
protest was a national event, Victoria’s
Secret stores had been prerwarned.

The protestors handed a letter to
the manager of the Victoria’s Secret,
stating the goal of the protest: for the
chain’s catalogs to use at least 50% re-
cycled papcr. National environmental
groups allege that Victoria’s Secret uses
paper from the Canadian boreal forest,
one of the last large unspoiled stretches
of forest in North America.

“Pretty much no major catalogs use
recycled paper," said Eaton. “Victoria’s
Secret sends out more than a million
catalogs per day”The protest, part of a
national "Day of Action" organized by
the national environmental group For—
est Ethies, focused on Victoria’s Secret
in part out ofan attempt to garner me-
dia attention.

FTP sent out press releases about
the protest to news organizations, and
showed up with costumes and props to
attract attention in the mall. Accord
ing to Baton, some students wore slips
or bras over their
clothes, They carried
a large banner read~
ing “Victoria’s Secret
Kills Endangered
Forests" and cards
board saws.

length of the protest,

was pleasantly sur-

prised when two high
school students in the mall asked to
join in. The high school students were
given signs, and followed the Grinnell
students out of the mall when security
asked them to leave.

The protest at the mall isn’t the last
action that FTP plans to take against
Victoria’s Secret. Previously FTP has
asked passersby at malls to sign posts
cards pre—addressed to the CEO of
Victoria’s Secret complaining about tlic
use of recycled paper. FTP is consid-
ering doing this again, as well as other
plans designed to draw media attention
to Victoria’s Secret. “We're not going to
stop until it’s changed,” said Eaton,

5&8 investigates the college’s saving strategies

av DAVID ARCHER

Since the beginning of the ﬁS’
(3111 year, the college’s endowment has
inched up less than one percent to a
little over 81:3 billion as of the closing
of the stock market Tuesday, according
to College Treasure. David Clay.

Grinnell College has one otthe large
est university or college endowments in
the country and is among the largest
per student among liberal arts colleges.
“Growth of the college's endowment
has primarily been investment—driven,"
Clay said.The endowment has grown
by applying a ”value oriented" strategy
that allocates about 70 percent of the
endowment in stocks in domestic and
international markets, Clay said.

At the end of the fiscal year 2003-
2004 on June 30, the endowment was
worth $1.292 billion, capping a one-
year return orzo.l percentThe endowV
merit has increased 9.2 percent over the
pastflve years and 16.1 percent over the
past 10 years, substantially outperform-
ing the sod) 500, a stock performance
index,which returned 11.8 percent over
the past ten years.

Another 20 percent of the endow
ment is invested in alternative equities,
which includes venture and nonrvenr
ture private companies, real estate, and
marketable alternatives. Clay said the
college no longer makes direct invest»
merits in 501?in companies, and int
stead operates through vennire capital

firms, another form of alternative equi~
ties.

The college has acted as a venture
capital ﬁrm in the past, however. In
1968, the Board of Trustees invested
$300,000 to fund a Silicon Valley starts
up called Intel, cerfounded by alum
Robert N. Noyce ‘49,Today lnrel is the
largest computer chip designer in the
world.

The remaining 10 percent of the
endowment is invested in cash and
ﬁxed income, like treasury bills. Clay
said the college likes to “kecpno less
than two to three years of endowment
spending in cash and short-term bond
investments to guarantee the availabilr
ity of cash to support the operations of
the college."

The college also uses the cash to
hedge its bets against the more volatile
equity and bond markets, Clay said,

Unlike some schools, the college
“tcnd[s] to have fewer managers than
most endowments," Clay said. The col-
lege hires three managers to work on its
investments in the stock market, and
another 10 mangers to work on the
“alternative" equities. The endowment
management runs a lean ship, as the
college does little of its own research
and analysis. Clay instead focuses his
energies on ﬁnding the right people to
manage the college’s investments. It’s a
“good, simple, straight forward model,"
Clay said.
