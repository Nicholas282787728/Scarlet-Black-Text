Dear Dick Williams, _

laru rakingyou up on yourofferrocommenron dic“NewMea1
plans and services for 20042005" email rhar was sear our Wed,
May srh.

Eirsr off, i am excired aborrr rhe new oprions ar rhe Forum and
rhe beginning rransirion ro rhe marche dining sryle. l rhink diese
changes will benenr campus. However, as you may have guessed, rlic
brurrr oirhis lerrer is nor posirive. I am saddened by rhe decision ro
close sourhern Depress ivirhour providing a means for rhe use of
meal equivalencio and drink drar rhe decision should be reevaluared

Tire Sourhern Express is used by many, many srudenu. You know
rhar berrer rhan i do. And, despire Dining Scrvlcn' impression rhar
“Srudenrs . . . do nor believe rhe Express offers a good value in rerms
ordie meal equivalency oprion" nearly all rlre srudenrs who vored in
rlre inosr recenr sen sponsored eleccions on iniriarivessaid rhac rhey
would like so keep Sourhem Express or an equivalenr open. (Exacr
resulrs copied from blackboard are below). To me rhis means rhar
rhere are rwo quesrions being asked. Dining services asked wherher
sourliern Express was a good meal equivalency. lr seems some said
no. However, when die quesrion is posed in a way rhai asks ifsourh.
ern Express or an equivalenc is berrer rlran nor having a sourlaem
Express/equivlenr. rhe answer is resoundingly in favor of keeping
such a service on campus.

1 do recognize rhar my concerns cordd be mer by an alrernarive
ro sourhern Express. 1 would like ro offer such a solurion. My issue
is wrrlr losing rhe abiliry ro purchase iood wirli meal equivalencies.
Thus, so long as rherc is a sysrem rhar allows srudenrs ro spend one
meal equivalency a day, as rhe Sourhern Express sysrem currenrly
allows, on adecenr range offood oprions, lwill be conrenr. onevmy
ro do rhis would be ar rlre Forum, lfsrudenrs cordd spend $3.50
(on: meal equivalency) ar rhe Forum Grille, insread of sourlrern
Express, I would be conrenr.

The added dining dollars mcnrioned in she email do nor serve as
a Sourhern Express equivalenra Whar makes sourhern Express espe
cially valuable is rhar you can pay for irems wirh rhe meal eqiiivae
lency. lr is exrremely beneﬁcial ro srudcnrs ro know rhar ifrhey miss
a meal rlieir money is nor rorally wasred because rliey can buy some
drings or express. Dining dollars do nor serve rliis purpose

secondly, rlie cosr of“cxrm" dining dollars are in parr being cov.
ered by rhe increased cosr ofdining plans. Lasr year i7 meals and
3125 dining dollars cosr $1745 per semesrec l believe rhar works
our ro $95 dollars for 17 meals per week. under rhe new plans, 15
meals and $175 dining dollars cosrs 1833. Thar is $111 per week for
fewer meals. l can undersrand rhar rhc cosrs orDinrng services are
increasing. I am nor here ro gripe abour she rising fees ofrhe College.
However. wirhour meal equivdencies rhere is no doubr rhar srudenr
will be paying more and gerring less,

Einally, l ani rroubled by rhe menrioir of rlre Campus cenrer
commirree as a way ofsupporring rhe cliango ourlrncd in die email.
Tire sourhern Express change is conrrary ro rhe srudenr opinions I
have heard voiced in comniltreea l disrincrly remember ar rhe close
oflasr year. Joseph oppong and lsrressed rhe imporrance ofmaine
raining a meal equivalency oprion on campris. i feel rlrar every rime
rlre issue ofhoiv Express funcrions would be irrregrared inro the Cam.
pus cenrer, the srudeiirs reprcscnrarives on rlre coinmirree made clear
rhar a rop prioriry was rhe rransier orrlie meal equivalency system.
The changes ourlined in rhcemail do nor mﬂccrrhlssenrimenrnrall.

I hope rhar you will reconsider rhe decision ro close rhc sorrrhern
Express wirhour providing an alrernarive way ofallowing for rhe use
of meal equivalencies. As well, l hope rhar sonre sysrein of using
meal equivaleircics is included in die campus cenrer.

Express closure
ignores students

We, rhe srudenr represenrarives ro rhe Dining services Commire
ree, would like ro express our grear frusrrarion wirh rlie decision ro
permanenily close die Sondrern Express. We believe rhar rliis deci.
sion is unwarranred and we furrhcrmorc believe rhar rhe adminisrra.
rion . speciﬁcally Dining Services _ subverred rhe principles ofselo
governance by purposefully excluding sriidenrs from rhe decision
making process.

The large volume ofbusrness which Express receives on a nighrly
basis makes ir clear drar srudenrs appreciare express. This apprecra.
rion was made even more rangible by the resuirs ofrhe reeenr Stu-
denr lniriariv , which found rhar over 95% ofsrudenrs supporr keep—
ing rhe Express open. While we recognize rhar rhe new Meal Plan
sri-ucrrire for iiexr year has several rlrings ro recommend ir we see no
reason why rlicse posrrrve poirirs necessirare ihe closure of rho Ex-
press, Alrhougli ir is rrue rlrar many srudenrs wish drar rlie value of

for closing ir, Nor do we rhink rhar rhc apparenr exclusion ofrhe
Express from rhe Campus cenrer, srill rwo years off, warranrs immee

press irom rhe faciliry, ror die same reasons given above.

orrrguably grearer concern is rlre manner in which rlre admin.

An adult’s choice

While Professor Gum’s adicrncemenr ofsmokofree dorm build.
ings has noble inrenrions, he fails ro consider rhe irnplicarions drar
would mull from such a policy. (Disclosure: l have smoked for die
mayoriry ofmy rime ar rhis insrirurion.) Regardless ofwlrerher rhis
issue is codiﬁed under healrli or self-governance. Gum's lerrer fails ro
address rhe complicarions I fear may occur from ushering in a no
smoking policy in she dorms. (I will avoid a criricism ofrhe 40 per
cenr srarisric, since sarn Ecksrur's lerrer provided ample informarion
on rhar from.)

Mr, Gum hopes rhar rhe rransirion can be made as smoorhly as
possible and rhar services from animal Regional can be ofassisrance
in helping srudenrs ro quir. Eroin my experience, smokers quir when
rhey are ready ro and feel like rhey can quit, No program that's of.
fered will auromarically morivare ever smoker ro give up rlie habit. i
plan ro qiiir smokingafrer graduarion for my own personal reasons
Even rliorigh i will be leaving campus afrer rhis semesrer, l cannor
imagine ruyselfquirring because ofa policy. scudenrs will conrinue
ro sinoke, regardless ofwherlier die adnririisrrarion iiisrirures a ban
or nor. ic is incredibly specious ro predicr a number oisrudenrs drar
will quir ro justify rhe policy.

Professor Gum is also disappoinred rhar 4o percenr ofsrudeno
smoke and wonders wlrar kind ofmessage ir sends ro rhe communiry
and prospecrive sruderrrs. Well, Professor, ir sends rhe message rhar
rhe srudenrs are 18 and considered adulrs by rliis srare and counrry
and rlrey are free ro purchase and consume robacco producrs if rhey
desircro do so. regardless ofany piry you may have ior rhc careeryou
rhink maybe denied rhem because ofdisease. While rhe abiliry ro
smoke may be crrrrailed by policies ar various levels. rhe freedom ro
make rlie decision ro pul‘chrﬂe robacco and consume u is srill ours,

Mr. Gum’s “disappointmmr” verges on rhe parroniaing ro me,
because i am considered an adrrlr, free ro make my own decisions
regarding perfecrly legal subsranccs. As rlrc debare sraiids righr irow,
any insrirurion ofa non—smoidng ban in rhe dorms would be cnrireiy
