Warm winter blankets

by Bradley Iverson- Long &
Courtney Prior

Bradley: A bibleefcaring Midwutem
high school boy’s wintry first love to a quilt
ing Christian. It sounds like ahod emo song
but it makes for a great comic book. Craig
Thompson's Blarrkm set the alternative
comic world ablaze last ym. You may not
have smelled the smoke but you should sec
what’s cooking. Here’s his recipe ror xuc»
Cm:

In a manic s92 paged tomc,Thomp-
son tells the autobiographical tale or him
and Raina, a cute, wispythalrcd poet he
meen at a church camp and his interstate
journey to visit her during the winter ofhis
senior year, when neither of them gives a
damn about rlieirAP classes.

Courtney: liar/tee is not your stereo—
typin comic book. There are no superhe»
toes, no scantily clad buxom villaincssm and
you’d never catch your prepubescent male
neighbor ﬁling it away in one orthose thin
plastic bags. This is the first comic book
I've read and l was surprised that it read so
much like a “real” nov:l. Craig and Raina‘s
love story is universal enough that any
Grinnellian could relate, but Thompson
creates a unique story by deftly interweav-
ing tales from hls religious, Midwestern
childhood, Min/22:: is substantial enough
to feel like a “r " book, but Thompson
uses illustrations to perfectly convey the
emotions orthe story.

Thompson's Michigan snowseapes are

rates his style when needed, usually coin-
ciding with a swell of emotions in Raina
and Craig’s relationship, full nf“high school
norllings" that have the weigrt or every.
thing. Thompson retains all or the can»
rounding emotions orhis first love—it is
impossible for any breeder boy nor to fall
for Raina as dnrwn by Craig.

C: And cmigis the type ofboyl would

now, possibly The story draws on those
common “high school nothings" and ﬁrst
love experienocs to elicit an intense :mot
uonal response. Following cmig and Raina's
story involves reliving every aspect orone’s
own first love, all while knowing that Craig
and Raina will eventually have to experi-
ence their first love lost.

B: Oh, don't talk about the sad ending.
Talkabout theansulyet amoroussotscenes.
You know you want to. Alas, Craig and
Rainas escape into temptation and love can't
overcome their burdened lives brimming
with divorcing or depriving parents. seri-
ous sibling issues and spiritual uncertainty
But, like the walks through snowy ﬁelds that
Craig indulges in, his love temporarily and
transcendently removes all lire's obstacles so
fully that, even after coming inside, he re.

c: Yeah, I admit the sex scenes were very
hot, but there was a lot more sadness than
sex. I cried at least ten (imn during this
story Then, when it was over, l cried a lot
more, For those keeping count, heres a list
or the pages that made me cry: 158, 173,
347, 361, 369, 404, 424, 464. 430. 484,

ELM/ear is that it proved to me that comic
books don't have to be lame, or dorky or
involve men wearing spandex. Since Bknt

including one with superheroes,
