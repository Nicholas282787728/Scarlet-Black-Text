Music to relieve 'pOSt-election blues

This weekend, music will heal your election-weary souli Grin-
neu will host two concerts, one on Saturday and one on Sunday.
Whether you want to calmly sulk in introspection or dance wildly,
hungering for a protest, these concerts will feed your need.

Playing with Earlimart and Aspects of Physics, Pinback per—
forms in Gardner Lounge on Saturday With detailed melodies and
soothing vocals, this band offers a unique indie rock sound without
succumbing to pretension. Catchy and refined, their songs represent
an excellent balance between clever lyrics and layered harmonies.
Their music is poignant without being overwhelmingly emotional,
witty without being condescending. san Diego's Zach Smith (6X13
Mile Pilot) and Rob Crow (Thingy and eXrHeavy Vegetable) do not
merely play indie rock music, but rather rcformulate the genre'l'hey
create mellow, yet danceable ballads that are surprisingly complut,
beautiful and different.

Le Tigre's highlyeanticipated performance, taking place in Hare
ris on Sunday, will undoubtedly appeal to Grinnell’s activists, liberals
and music enthusiasts. Creating ﬁerce anthems,.involving social and
political issues, feminism, and sexuality, Le Tigre combines electron-

ic sounds and punk rock.

The band intersperses sound clips from war protests and news
broadcasts throughout their songs to produce higl‘renergy music
that is not only extremely danceable but also powerful and inspiring.
Whether sharply criticizing the war in Iraq or referring to feminism
and gay and lesbian rights, vocalist Kathleen Hanna (ex-Bikini Kill)
bares the band’s strong opinions on controversial issues, sometimes
breaking into angry, shrill shouts.The effect is undeniably unique:
intelligent dance music, tough and estrogenrsoaked.

Le Tigre will undoubtedly appeal to the current political climate
on campus. In the song “seconds," Hanna viciously breaks into an
anti—Bush tantrum, screaming "you make me sick" after repeated refs
erences to lying and warmongering. In the song ”Get Oil the Inter
net," Le Tigre urges others to “meet [them] in the streets" and “de—
stroy the right wing." Playing with The Gossip and Measles Mumps
Rubella, the band will put on a show intrinsically different from
others at GrinncU. With slide shows and their own dance moves, Le
Tigre not only entertains its audiences,but also emboldens them.
