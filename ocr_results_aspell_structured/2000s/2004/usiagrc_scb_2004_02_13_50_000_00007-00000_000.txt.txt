Passion over profit

Kirsten Tretbar ‘89, director, producer and photographer of the independent
documentary film, Zenith, visits Grinnell for the second year in a row to teach a

three-week short course about the process of making independent ﬁlms

b y AI y B e e ry

So they told us when we cam: to Grinnell that the theory behind a
liberal arts education was not to prepare you tor a specific job, but
rathcr make you a wclhounded. critical thinking person, supposedly
marketable for any job (or graduare school). Any job? Whut about
something artistic like music, 1([mg or ﬁlmmaking?

Right. And live ctr or Ramen and Pop Tarts. Those days are sup.
posed to come to an end with graduation.

Kirsten Trethar ‘89 may not be making millions, but she’s eating
hotter than Express-dependent college students and can claim the titles
“Director and Producer" ofa documentary ﬁlm. This is thtbat's :cc»
and semester teaching a three-week short course at Glinncll about the
business or independent filmmakiug. "It's exciting to come back as an
alum and teach that there is a real world out there working as a free
lance creative person," said Ttetbar.

A showing ofTretbar’s ﬁlm was held on Mon-
day in the South Lounge. students, local farmers
and church members that had heard about the
ﬁlm had an opportunity to watch the SGlenute
ﬁlm and ask questions of the director afterward.

thrhsceks to capntre the struggles Zenith, Kan.
sas, rarcs during the farming crisis with the help of
their faith and each other. The ﬁlm's description on
its websitev http://wwwunirlnbmwir. mm, describcr
it as a "feature documentary about farming, faithi
and the resilience orthc human spirit." Farming is
the cornerstone orthe town. Dependence on such a
riclde occupation, however, has forced the people or
zenith to turn elsewhere for strength when money
is scarce. -

The “faith and tesilience" of Zenith come in th: form oft Passion
Play, a dramatiution of the life oflcsus that originated hundreds ofyeals
ago in Oheiammcrgau, Germany. For twelve years, ever since a man named
Guy Eliot moved to Zenith from Texas and introduced dac idea to some
of the townspeoplcr Zenith has put on the Great Plaincs Passion Play
Trethar's documentary tracks the process of putting together the Passion
Play and the background against which the play was created: a town in
ﬁnancial crisis, but with an abundance of faith,

The farm crisis affecting the members of the Zenith community
during the 1999 rrlming oiTretlssr's rilnr was an interesting background
against which Ttetbat shot her independent ﬁlm. “While 1 was mak-
ing this ﬁlm i reit that i was living a parallel story," she said. “Farmers
love their land and what they do so much and they will do it even if
they aren't making money."

This was exactly what’rrethar did: made her film without the guara

little town orzenith, however, Trethai’s love caused her to go hank

Trctbar teaches in the short course for which she has traveled to Grins
nell the past two springs are the harsh realities involved in melting a

incnt some acceptance ofhow dirrieult the process can be. “1 feel like

said Chris Forster-Smith *0o, who took Trerloar‘s class last spring, “Ir

without their art.

“There’s no reason that once you get out orcoliege you can't put.

help students at crinnell have faith in these possibilities is a ﬁlm de»

Forster—smith also expressed frustration with Grinnelrs lack of

Grinneli because there’s no classes, cxccpt this one. and there's no ac.

ncll, “The time limitation prevents it."
