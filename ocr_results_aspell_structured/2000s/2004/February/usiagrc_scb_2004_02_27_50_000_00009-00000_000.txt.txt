Trying his hardest

Trymore Magomana ‘07 was the first person from his village in Zimbabwe to graduate from
high school, and beat incredible financial and logistic odds to attend Grinnell

“it's boosuse orltrrornvrlaeogrnphorlrar I'm here," saidTryrnore Megornana
’07 with a smile, “I drink I should mlu: :soiivenir of that National Geogmp/Jl'r,
I should put it in 2| treasure box and lodc it up."

Megomana is referring ro rhe May 1981 rssue ofNrmma/Gmgmp/Iit, which
he found in an old antique shop rim his home in Zimbabwe. The issue had an
article on Iowa. and included a Small map ofthe state, with an even smaller dot
son-lcwhcl'c in the middle proclaiming, “Grimwll—Grilincll College."

Aocordmg ro Magornano, he snw d1e dor, looked nr rhe beaudhrl pierures
ordre Iowan lmdsmpc and buildings in downtown Des Moincs, and drought,
“Grinnell College! I need to look into that."

The application process

Unfortunately for Magornane, he had almost no merns of looking inro
crinnsu. A visir was our of dre gnesuon, and so was bomber researeh on me
inrcmer, sinoe Megomnnn's home village has no electricity, no running water
and no phone lines. Msgornnna ended up ﬁnding our more about Grinnell by
sendingalener over to d1c United stares—a huge oepense for his tnmily, which
has four boys including Magomans end errns an :innuzl moomc ofzbout
$200.

The college responded to his loner by sending Magomenn intorn-iauon
and application materials. I-Iewas blown away by Gnnneu's noedlshnd admis.
sion policy. “Ablind oollegcmblind eoilegei" he exclaimed. “Grinnell isaspecial
place in rhe world—no, no, in rhe universe... a college audacious enougr as to
otter opportunirios for poor kids like me!"

As ir cumod out. however, getting rhc opportunirywas rhe easy pm. The
hard pm was complenng rhe provided appliomon, Fusr, Magomann had to
rake rhe SATs.

“[1] askiod] the librarian, ‘Can I have some SAT pmpmtlon marerialszm
snid Magomann. “She snid. 'Whnt?’ She'd never heud anyrhing about SATs."
Mngomane explsinod rhar almost no one in 7meahwe rakes me testiln fact,

Therefore, hc didnt have much choice about pmpmlicln when it me

said. “And rhere I was, and rook rhe com, and got hncle No preparation, no
myrhing . .. and I didn't do rh-ar badly"

Magomana's nmstep was to induce his high school reaches ro wnre him

sounds “In Zimbabwe, we don't write recommendanon letters," he said. ”So
here is dsis kid saying, ‘Here, (:ln you wnie this recommendnuona' They were

"one or die admissions ethos guys said 12 Zimbabwe studenrs applied,
andi knew dross reels were from rhe besrsehools in Zimbnlwve, with rhe best

id say rrwss impossible tor me to get admitted."

Placing education ﬁrst

Magornenn rum admitted, however hugely due to his phenomenal come
rnirmenr ro education during primary and secondary school in Zimoabwe.
Approximerely as percent of die poople in his village ere illirenre, and most
simply don't see a need tor eduornon.

The high illireraey niresrerns in part from rhcdisranoe between Lllc schools
and Magomands village. "You’d ﬁnd not I'm rhe only one or my age [in the
village] mending school righr noW.” he said. “The nearer primary school is
abonrlive miles owey. and when younc l l yearsold you isn’t walk to end from
[there], it's kind otdiiheulr, It discourages people from going to school.”

A day in
the life

Trymore Magomana ‘07

2 arm. 1 wake up, making sure not to disturb Ryan [Long
'07, roommate], shower and journey to Noyce. I see the
security otﬁcar on duty driving by as 1 cross Eighth St. i
give a wave in the semi-darkness.

5:05 am I’m disturbed by the custodian coming to clean
the computer lab. She asks the if I slept, Itell her that, ”in
life you give up a few things chasing a dream.” She shakes
her head in amazement.

3 am I walk up to my calc class, and ﬁnd that the pint is
excited about teaching cycloids, and equations of circles.
He gives us the equation of a hearteshaped curve (r a 1 s
sin_) and tells the class, “Instead of sanding your loved
ones a card, send them this equation." I start entertaining
idoas or majoring in Math.

10:55 arm. High spirited, I rush to the post ofﬁce,
calculating that since I haven’t received a letter in the past
week, today i must receive one. My expectation is enhanced
when i get into the post office and see everybody reading
or opening letters. t peer into my mailbox, and see that it's
empty. I open itjilst to make sure, arid my fears yet
Conﬁrmed: in] latte! in three weeks‘. A girl next to me reads
the disappointment written allover my race and says,
”Don’t worry, you will receive something tomorrow." I doubt
her prophecy, dismissing it as a ﬂuke,

11:45 am. 1 get into towlcs, praying and hoping that the
food being served is palatable. The checker says "Hi,“ sort
of implying that maybe the food is good. "Shit!" I shout
when 1 see that they are serving the same old tasteless
shrimp and sticky mashed potatoes. 1 eat the dixh that!
call ”the Last line of defense”? steamed rice.

12:06 p.m. I boot on my computer (named Voyager ﬁne.
after the space probe launched in 1979 which is billions of
miles away from earth), open my Outlook account and
discover that I have 25 e-niails. I feel consoled that I have
e-mzils even though I didn't have letters at the post ofﬁce.
1:05 pm. I get to my bio class, and ﬁnd that the prof has
assigned everyone to groups for an experiment. I question
the logic of categorizing us into groups, instead or just
saying, "each person choose two other people you like," On
this ﬁrst day or our CLaSS meedng, she gives us a guizl

4 p.m. I get back in my room, and I give Ryan a copy of
the New York Times, telling him to lead an artltle describing
how eight million people in Zimbabwe are facing staNation
because of the police; of the government.

5:09 pm. 1 tell Ryan that my problems in tits all originate
from one sourte~woriieiis I tell him ”girls are trouble,
watch out tor them." He laughs, saying, "you don't
understand women, Tryriiore.”

5:30 pm. Working at Cowles, the supervisor sees me all
pale and sullen. He says, ”come here, irymore," and he
gives me a hug, saying, "I hope that makes you real
better." I tell him I want to go home.

9 pm. I attend the weekly meeting of the 5&5; as i walk
in one of the editors is asking, ”Why are you all here if you
don't want to take the stories? this is your paper too." I
just look at her and smile, thinking that she is right.

10 pm. I get to the PEC and ﬁnd that the soccer team is
already playing the beautiful game. i apologize for being
late. I observe how Miller is turning out to be a
professional soccer player; his dribbling skills improving
daily.

11:05 p.iii. I play the cartoon movie Treasure Planet}
telling Ryan that I’m addicted to it and i love the part
where the Captain says. "in. Dupler, your reasoning borders
on the imbecllic."

12:15 am. Itell Ryan good night, knowing that 1 will
wake up in less than one hour and 45 minutes to start
another day.
