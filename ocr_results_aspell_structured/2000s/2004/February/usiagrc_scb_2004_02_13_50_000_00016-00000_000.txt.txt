The

Coach

way

David Arseneaull’s chaotic full court press
scheme is slowly spreailing to other schools

by David Archer

Men’s basketball coach David Arsenearrir designed his fiin.aiid.giin
style for teams that plain stuiiltso his players could have something to rattle
about after they lost, However, the system has been so successful that other
coaches have started to expcrimcnt ivith the Arseneault way.

“I have probably conferred with over 500 coaches over the past ten
years," said Arseneault, and indeed many high school programs have
adopted similarly rcoord smashing game plans So in, though the only
other coaches in the century who run Arsenetitilts svxteni at the college
level ate University olRedlands mam coach Gary Smith and Mtilileiibci n
College womens coach Ron Rohii.

helm and Smith said their players ivere skeptical when introduced to
the new style ofplay. However, Rohn's players gitiv increasingly enthusiastic
throughout the preseason, especiaby airorthty cxlumtﬁd an intramural team
ofirien with the substitution pattern in a scrimmage last November, Then
the season began, and the teams quick sueetss cmst airy lingering doubts.

“When he opened theseason wrih two [Corpoint games in our ilp»oﬂ"
tournament, thcic was no going back," Rohn snid.

Players at Redland: initially disliked the limited playing time and coin»
planted that the short shifts made it dlﬂlcnlr to establish a rhythm In
addition, they dcrcsred" yielding easy points on doienst- a netessiiy rot
the system to work properly

“Our players do enjoy rhesysrcm noiv, smith said, At least most or
them do,”

smith used an up-tcmpo strategy in the 19805 and 90s but deserted it
in 1995 before deciding to rryArseneaiilt's Strategy in the 200203 season.
Last season his team posstssed enough depth and enough shooters to make
it work, Smith said. The idea appealed to Smith because it might help him
win more games but also because it’s a bit offbeat.

“I must profess a personal preference for being somewhat different
and for playing at an extreme and otrhe spectrum," smith said. “I felt it
would be a good way to shake things up as we were not doing too Well."

Nineteen games into the season Redlands sports an 11-8 record and
sits in ﬁfth place in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Cone
ference. What’s more, Smith suggested the team has yet to work out kinks

in the system, as this is the

first year the team has cm-

pioyed the strategy in its
entirety.

Rohn’s strategy, however. does not esactly replicate Arsencualt's. He
has had to tailor the system to the physical differences presented by eoadn
ing a ivornons team. For instance, Muhienberg attempts half the three»
pointers Antneault’s teanr attempts because his players “can't rise up and
shoot over a defender from 20 feet," he said. In addition, he said his plays
ers cannot get the bail hneline to baseline as quick as the men.

Muhlenbtrg is the only Division iii women’s team playing euirently
using this peculiar strategy, and they've met some success so tar as they

Such results may seem like unintended consequences or the

the Gtinnell men's basketball team, and their unique
”system,” developed by head basketball coach Dave
Arseneault, is one of the staples of Grinrlell College. This
system revolves around treating defensive turnovers and
taking a multitude of three-point shots. Five new Pinnécr
players rush into the game every minute-zud-a-half to
keep up the fast-paced action. Opposing teams ﬁnd they
have trouble keeping up the intense clip the Pioneers
play at, and since its introduction at Grinnell College.
the “system" has been very successful, with Grinriell
winning conference titles in two ofthe last three years.

Despite the success, Coach A, as his players and fails
call him, has taken heat from basketball purists for his
unique invention, and at this same time, has had some
success in teaching other coaches his methods.

”To each his or her own," soid Arseneoult. ”I can't
control what other people think or say about us. All I
know is that my players are happy and we have
entertained a lot of people over the past decade."

The Pioneer players have had to go through some
changes from their high school basketball background in
order to be successful at Grinnell. twin seniors to
freshman, the "system" tale for mass participation and
faith in the program.

"I admit at ﬁrst it seems a little crazy/1 said Patrick
Chdduette '04, "but once your mind and body speed up
to the style of play you realize that it's the same game

._ only a tiny bit quicker. To be successful in our system
it takes the same skills and iundamentols that it would
take to be successful at any program in the country,"

”I feel really rortunote to be able to play fo'r a team that
plays such ti fun style of basketball." said Trek langonhan
'07. "i enjoy being a part disdmething so unique. There are
hundreds ufcollege basketball Learns out there but the
system sets us apart from most of the others."

The success at Arseneault's system and or this years
Pioneer squad has Grihnelliatis and members of the media
talking across the country. but the_Pioneers know that,
especially given that iheyre the defending conference
champs, lhcyll be a incited team came playoff time.

”The attention does give opponents an extra reason to
be gunning fol us," said junior Matt Brown, "so we can
never expect to catch anyone ofi guard. But at the some
time, all of the attention is just one more thing for us to
draw off of too, It's exciting to know that people are
taking notice of our success." - Kevin liyrnc

Th ve goals

the system is complicated, but come game time Griniiell
has just five simple but efitclive goals, “We are
something like 60-3 over the past to years when we
accomplish all ﬁve goals," says head coach David Arseneault,
