by Josh Cooley

When Mollie Hayward 04 Smrtcd band in the fourth grade, the
ﬂute wasnt her ﬁrst choice Instrument

“To be honesr, I wnnred ro play rho oboe, she said, brrr rhey
didnt ler you srarr rhe oboe In fourrh grade. When rhey were reerng
oursrudenrs," said Hayward describingrry ours, “rhey prrrdrsinfcc.
ranr on all rhe moudrpreee ro clean the Insrrumenrs afrcr eaeh stu-
denr played I chose the flure because I dIdn'r have re pur II in my
mouth because the disinfectant tasted really bad. ”

Hayrvards unoaierriarod choice ofinsrrrrmenrs hn morphed Inro
a 13 year affair widi dro Ilure. Though nor a music major, her olenr
and dedication to the ﬂute have earned her 1 senior recital.

Hayward srarred taking piano lessons or age six. Since her father
was a piano reachcr, and her grandfarher was a piano runcr and
rebuilder, the piano seemed the instrument of choice in the Hay-
ward family. Bur she never showed mrrch Inreresr in the piano and
soon found her love ofmusic was besr expressed by playing the flora.

“she picired it up and played Ir every rIme she walked pasr Ir,"
said Zita Hayward, Mollie's mother, “She was Interested from the
beginning."

Hayward’s beginner band elass only had 30 kids, bur when she
started high school, she joined rt 150 member band, and was soon
acknowleged as the school's best ﬂnutist, She had honors recitals
dunng borh her sophomore and junior years, and played a senror
solo during her frnal year orhigh school, she also arrended the Na.
tional High School Music Institute at Northwestern the summer
afrer her junior year.

When she srarred rhe eoIIege applicarron process, Hayward con-
sidered applying ro several music schools bur didn'r and up applying
to any. Since she knew that she had a pmion for English 25 well as
musrc, Hayward looked ar schools which had srron programs In
borh and which would let her conrinue her ﬂute playIng. even ifshe
wasn’r a music major.

“By rhe end or my senior year, I never made audIrIon rapes,"
said Hayward. “I wasn’t posirive enough rhar I wanred ro do musrc
for rhe resr ofnry life.”

Grinnell’s cheap ruirion and its proximity ro her homerown of
Evansrorr ended up luring Hayward here. When she mine ro crinnell.
Hayward jumped righr inro rho various musical programs orrered
by rhe college, joining rhe Symphonic Band, Larin American En-
semble, and Fresh Hurcs Choir. In addirion, she signed up to rake
weekly hour—long privare lessons from l<rmberly Heiron, assistant
music associate and director of Fresh Flutes.

“When I first came here I wanted to double major in music,"

moved a Ior or the Immarure habrrs from her playing rIIar she had
when I began reaching her," said Helron, ”which has really allowed
