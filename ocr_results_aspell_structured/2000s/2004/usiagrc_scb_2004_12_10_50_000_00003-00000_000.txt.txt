Energy and
compassion

Friends share their favorite moments, qualities and
quirks of .Thomas Alexander ’05

av BEN WEVL
Friends remember Thomas Alex-
ander “05 as a funny and cornpassion-_
are friend and leader. They remember
someone who gave one hundred percent
of himself to every challenge he faced
and relationship he forged. His enthu-
siasm for life and friendship was evi»
dent in all that he did.
on the Saturday of'l‘ltanksgive
ing break, Alexander was in a car ac~
cident in Minnesota with his fiance
Aven Frey '05 and her family Frey
and her mother and brother were
hospitalized, Alexander and Frcy's far
that were killed in the accident.

Master of the Sword
Alexander remained active with Dag
throughout his Grinncll career. Dag players
beneﬁted from his dynamic personality and his pas~
sion for cultivating the organization. “Dag was one
of the big things he really enjoyed," said Ana Nagel
“05. “He enjoyed being [Dag] House Coordinator last
year and putting on the Renaissance Festival. He
would always be the pirate at the Renaissance Festival
and chase after small children."
Alexander knew many of his friends through
Daghorhir and shared his vivacity
with people on the field. “He had a
fantastic sense of humor. He was
very playful," said Nagelr “He liked
to swear a lot. He had a lot of really
colorful swears. He loved Dag. He
was really funny on the field. He
was just a great guy and a great
sportsman and really fun to
hang out with." _
Alexander’s friends iden~
tified his development as a
leader in Dag as one of the
most remarkable and repre
sentative aspects of his life,
As Alexander's commitment
, to Dag grew, he became an
ofﬁcial leader. He was dedis
cated to helping everyone in the group, a role
that served not only as an outlet for his fights
ing skills, but also a way to contribute to the
community and connect with others. “He
was a Master of the Sword," Nagel said.
“He was one of our leaders and he really
embraced that role... He really liked to
teach people how to ﬁght and he was re-
ally welcoming to new people."
Kent Cubbage ‘06 also remembers
Alexander’s thoughtfulness towards
the newer members of Dag. “He was
big on teaching," said Cubbage. “[Hc
thought] that we should pass down
what we know because there are no coaches
and people who join up are always left floun-
dering for a little while, trying to figure out
>/ what they’re doing."

An infectious personality

Other friends remember how his vi-
brant personality and conﬁdence at»
fected those off the field as well. His
friends characterize his forwardness
as disarming and inviting rather
than intimidating. “When you ﬁrst
meet him. he has a very strong per»
sonality," said Jacob Barrera ‘05. “He
kind of freaks you out because he
is unembarrassed about anything
he does. He was a wonderful

person to be around."
Alexander's outgoing nature
often manifested itself in other
wise everyday, dull situations that

”Thomas proposed
to Aven on Field
Day in May last year
and he brought us
all into the circle.
He was dressed
up as a knight, and
he proposed to her
right there, and she

Alexander infused with a little wackiness or humor.
Kama Bnrquist ‘05 said that Alexander also had the
ability to infect others with his enthusiasm and ideas.
“Once while students were introducing themselves in
class,Thomas decided to add to the introduction and
said, ‘l’m a history major and 1 have cats.’ Then the
entire rest of the class said things like, ‘I have cats...
1 don‘t have cats, but I want cats... One person said
they were a dog p:rson...'”Thc ease with which Ale
cxandcr interacted with others and helped break the
ice made him approachable and dependable. “What
I think that I will remember most about him is how
he brought people together,” Barquist said. “I have so
many more friends because ofThomas."

Harmonic relationships

Alexander earned the respect of his fellow musi-
cians because of his passion and dedication to music,
just as he did the respect ofhis fellow fighters in Dag,
He played alto saxophone in high school and each see
mester at Grinnell. According to Mark Dorr, director
of the Grinnell College symphonic Band, in which
Alexander participated. “Thomas was an enthusias-
tic, funeloving saxophone player. He and I worked
together in designing the programs for both the Pets
cussion &Marimba Ensemble and symphonic Band
during the past two years. He was always dependable,
very conscientious, and a student that I came to re-
spect and trust very much,"

Dorr said the Symphonic Band
dedicated its Dec. 5 concert to his
memory and his beautiful musical
contribution to the ensemble. Dorr
said the band will also play one of
his favorite Sousa marches on Com—
mencement Weekend to honor him.

Friends say his commitments to
Dag and music were equaled by his
commitment to his personal relation-
ships. Alexander’s friends knew he
was dependable. “Thomas was a great
man,”Barrera said. “He really tried to
make you smile or laugh ifyou were
depressed, and he always did what he
could to help you out no matter the
situation. He was willing to put any
thing and everything else aside to help you."

Barrera remembers one example of Alorander’s
selﬂessness in particular, an incident that gave him
insight into the depths of Alexander’s empathy and
commitment to his friends, especially in times ofcri-
sis."When my parents were in a car accident, a head-
on collision, andl went to talk to Thomas in his room,
he had a 15—page paper to do, and I tried (0 walk
away, but he wouldn’t let me. He stopped writing his
paper and shut the door and said, “Look, I'm not let—
ting you leave. Talk to me."’

Friends remember Alexander as not only provid»
ing emotional support but as helping out in more
tangible, everyday ways as well. He acted as Ellie
Kemple's ‘05 own private eye: “Thomas was my head
when I couldn’t find it," said Kemplo. “I don't know
what I’m going to do now that I don’t have anybody to
find my stuff when I lose it. One time I left my wallet
somewhere and I was leaving for spring break and
Thomas found me later [at the airport] and got me
the wallet before I left. I was in the airport about to
board the plane and then he [used] the line about my
head falling offwithout him.

“Thomas was the most selﬂess person I’ve ever
met," she said, "He’s reallyjust one ofthe nicest peo-
ple I’ve ever met and I really, really wish thatI had had
more time to appreciate that.”

Dorr was also a recipient of Alexander’s random,
and often silly, acts ofkindness: “After the birth ofour
first daughter two years ago, Thomas brought me a
bottle ofcaffeinared pop and a Payday candy bar." he
said. “He gave them to me before Symphonic Band
rehearsal, telling me that the pop would come in hane
