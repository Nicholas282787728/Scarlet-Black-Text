U ItI mate rules Mac Field
The Elephantitis || tournament was just the most visible moment
in a long and crazy ride for Grinnell’s Ultimate Frisbee teams

13v BRAD BISHOP

Mac Field last weekend played host to the one
sport where the hippes m the jocks.

"Basically, Ultimate was starred by a bunch of hip
pies and the way Ultimate is set up is to be selfoﬁic'r
ating," said Ben Hanes ‘05, one of three team captains
for the Grinnell men’s team. “You aren’t playing to
win, but playing to play good frisbee; you are playing
friendly bur playing with spirit. Everyones chill—that
eomes from the hippie philosophy"

Ultimate's subsequent meteoric rise in popularity
in Grinnell culminated most recently in the Elephanr
titis II tournament on Mac Field on Sept. 25—6.The
second annual home Ultimate tournament for the
Grinnell Ulrimare reams drew in nearly 300 players
from colleges as far away as Vanderbilt. It was a size
able and comptetitive tournament, building on the
base created by last year's captains Nick Lloyd ‘04 and
Georgia Hart ‘04.

Elephantitis II featured a wide field of14 men‘s
and five women's teams, ranging from Division I-
III, with host Grinnell sponsoring two ofthc men's
teams and one women’s team. Nine ﬁelds r [our on
Mac Field, two north of campus, and three at Grins
ncll Middle School,were the venues for the weekend.
The tournament crowned Iowa State University as
the Women's Champion, while Grinncll's own Sticky
Tongue Frogs women's team ﬁnished a close second.

on the men’s side, the Grinnellephants w squad
ﬁnished Sth,while the “B" squad ﬁnished 13th.

The main event, according to Hanes,was the pars
ty on Saturday night. Lyle Buurnan, Dining Service
Director, let the teams use his farm for a huge bon-
fire and beer party for all teams visiting. As the men’s
team philosophy goes, “We may not win the tourna-
menr,burwe always win the party."

Another tournament highlight was the reappears
ance of the Grinnellephant’s mascot, which featured
Reid Wyatt ‘06 in an elephant suit made by a former
team member.

“His job was basically to be drunk and cheer everyone
on," said Hams/He did a goodjob with both ofthat."

One unique quality both teams have is their open
format for practices and membership.

“Our squad is really not set in stone," said Hanes.
“We have people who come just once a week and
that's cool. We are absolutely 100 percent open to
anyone who wants to play."

Hanes explained that the team practices consist of
tworthirds talking strategy and doing drills (or parties.
as they are called), and the other third playing pickup.

"were deﬁnitely a teaching team," he said. “Most
of the first»years that come here have little to no ex-
periencc; we’re open [0 all skill levels. i didn't srart
playing until my freshman year."

Grinnell also has a partrtime coach to help out.
Jesse Spohnholz, History, plays for one of the best
club teams in the nation, called Ethanol, and comes to
Grinnell practices twice a week to help the teams out.

that we have someone to give us direction," said Lexi
Abel ‘05 “We are very enthusiastic about Ultimate
and luckily Jesse is able to help us channel that energy
in positive ways."

Also in leadership positions this year are the men's
and women's captains. Hanes and Danny Marks ‘05
are the only two four—year team members on the
men's side, and they join with Richard West ‘06 to
form a tri-leadership team. Abel, a tour-year veteran,
heads up the women's team.

Even with the short season thus far (two tourna—
ments, including one Sept, 1849 at Luther college),
many memories have been made, most of them ins
volving nudity.

“We get naked a lot," said Hanes. “We got kicked
our of the pool at our hotel in Decorah for skinny—
dipping. and we streaked a both the men's and wom-
en’s teams r we streaked the Luther tourney."

“Getting naked is a great thing and the Ultimate
team does it well," Abel said.

Two other tournaments remain for both teams
this fall, including Hallowinona, liostedrby Winona
Smtca The spring scason also includes three or four
tournaments, including Mardi Gras in Baton Rouge,
Lu. “Think or it as your average frisbcc tourney on
steroids,"said Hanes.“We have a 17 hour drive to get
to the biggest tournament in the nation, and not to
mention the Ultimate Party."

authority

The ofﬁcial authority
on intercollegiate Ulti-
mate. the Ultimate Play-
ers Association (UPA),
explains the basics of
Ultimate: "Combining
the non-stop movement
and athletic endur—
ance of soccer with the
aerial passing skills
of football, a game of
Ultimate is played by
two seven-player squads
with a high-tech plastic
disc on a ﬁeld similar to
football. The object of
the game is to score by
catching a pass in the
opponent’s end zone. A
player must stop run—
ning while in possession
of the disc, but may
pivot and pass to any of
the other receivers on
the field" (httpmzwww.
