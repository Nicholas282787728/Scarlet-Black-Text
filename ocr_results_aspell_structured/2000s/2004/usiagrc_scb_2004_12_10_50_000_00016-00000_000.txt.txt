Men’s basketball learns to love life on the road, where every
victory is precious and even a rhome game’ is three hours away

xv KEVIN BVRNE

Men's basketball coach Dave Arseneanlt knows
that playing on the road isn't easy.

“Winning on the road in our conference requires
mental toughness," he said, “The amount of travel
time we log can really be tough on the bodies."

The Pioneels have learned that the hard way
during the first leg of their three-month barnstormr
ing tour of Iowa and the MidwesL Since dropping
their first three games, Grinnell has taken three of
four, including two in the past week.

Grinnell’s lone “home" game
(at least until the completion of
their new gym in late January) was
played on Saturday at Marshall
town Community College, and the
Pioneers came out firing like they
were back in Darby, beating the
Martin Luther Knights 127,35

Senior guard Eric Walsh led
the way for Grinnell with 19
points, including five threerpointr
ers, Hi5 offense, combined with
some key plays from fellow senior
Cole Robertson, sparked a 25»0 scoring run late in
the first half to put Grinnell in control,

“It felt good to know that we are capable of go—
ing on runs like that,” said Mike Schmidt ‘08, who
contributed 14 points of his own."1t will just give us
conﬁdence for future games that we can go on runs
like that aftel being behind."

It was an important win for Grinnell after a 1-4
start, and the Pioneers made it two straight with a
115411 victory against Grand View in Des Moines
on Tuesday. Walsh again led the way, this time with
20 points. A clutch Mott Blown ‘05 three-pointer
with just under rout minutes remaining pnt Grinnell
up for good as the Pioneers moved to within a game

games."

"it felt good to know
that we are capable

of going on runs like
that. It will just give us
confidence for future

of .500.

It’s back on the bus Saturday, as the team opens
conference play in Jacksonville, ILl. against Illinois
CoUegetThe biggest game ofthe season thus far, the
defense and offense will have to perform well in or-
der to win.

“Winning on the road no matter ifyou are the
best or worst is always a difﬁcult task," said Walsh.
“Based on the fact that we realize that we have no
real home games means that we need to bring an
extra effort to every road game. Each win gives us
extra satisfaction because we're dos
ing it in the other team's house, not
to mention the fact that we will
have to play somewhere else a week
later."

Arsencault also recognizes the
importance and difficulty of be-
ing able to go into someone else‘s
gym and leave with a victory. The

_ Mike Schmidt ,0 8 team has bccn working on both its

strengths and weaknesses in practic,
preparing for conference play.

“The strength has been our
defensive intensity," said Arseneault. “People scoff
at the fact that we give up so many points, but this
group has done a remarkable job forcing turnovers
by the opposition. Our weakness has been our drib-
blc penetration and general passing ability, 1 think a
lot of our subspar shooting to date is a reﬂection of
poor passing to our shooters. This will be an area of
emphasis over the next couple or months."

The next month will include trips across Illinois
and Wisconsin before ﬁnally returning for a home
game in late January. In the meantime, the Pioneers
will need to pick up key victories on the road in order
to stay in the hunt for their third Midwest Confer-
ence title in five years.

After a strong ﬁnish at
the Mutual of Omaha

and Ducks aim for Conference

It’s still December, but Grinnell’s swimming and diving teams, fresh off the Mutual of Omaha
lnvite in Nebraska, are already thinking of picking up two more Midwest Conference titles

BY Jus‘rlN WALLACE

The Grinnell swimming and diving teams, with
six combined Midwest Conference Championships
in past three years, look to be atop the conference yet
again after a strong showing at the Mutual of Omaha
Invitational last weekend.

The men, led by senior captains
Braden Fence and Brett MeMillian,
placed fourth out of eight teams in
a competitive field that included
the University of North Dakota,
which placed third at last year’s
NCAA Division II Champion—
ships. Pence took seventh place in
the SO freestyle in 2219, the fastest
time swum in the Midwest Confer
ence this year. Pence also clocked
48.64, another conference best, in
the finals of the 100 freestyle.

“Btadcn’s 100 freestyle was ins
credibly fast for this point in thc
season,”McMillian said. _

McMillian did not swim too badly himself, plac-
ing fifth in the 200 backstroke with a time of2:01.98,
the fastest in the conference this year by nearly seven
seconds.

Other significant contributors were Kevin Wood
‘05 (sixth, 100 butterﬂy; eighth, so freestyle), Darryl
Neufeld ‘05 (third, 1000 freestyle) and Matt Remis»
song ‘08 (ninth, 100 breast, eleventh, 200 breast).

”Both the men’s and
women’s teams are
looking to destroy
the conference this
year. The other teams
simply don’t have the
strength or depth that
the Grinnell team has."
iBrett McMi/Iian ‘05 sprint freestyle events, while Hal-

Turkish Water Polo phenom Ali Titiz ‘08, recently
named Player of the Year {or the Heartland Division
by the Collegiate Water Polo Association, swam a
personalrbest 54.90 in the prelims of the loo tree
5 le.
tyThe women swam to a strong fifth place in a
ten team field. Grinnell was led by
Amanda Keledjian ‘08, who missed
the school record in the 200 butter—
ﬂy in her first intercollegiate com-
petition by four tcnths of a second.
Keledjian garnered fourth, sixth,
eleventh and sixteenth place ﬁli’
ishes in her four individual events
in Omaha.

Sophomores Julia McHugh and
Lauren Gehbauer tallicd points for
Grinnell in the backstlokes and

Icy Feil ‘08 led the way in the 100
breaststroke with an eighteenth
place finish.

“The general consensus among the team and the
coaches was that this was the most effective Grinnell
has ever been at this meet. Attitudes were optimistic
and great times were posted," said captain Kathryn
Croco ‘05,

For most of the Mad Dogs and Mad Ducks (the
preferred monikers or the mens and women’s teams,
respectively), it was a challenge to just qualify tor the

finals that night. Only the top eighteen swimmers
in morning prelims could swim again at night, not
a small feat against Division II powerhouses North
Dakota on the men’s side and the University of Ne-
braskarOmaha on the women's. Remissong's 2:13.11
left him nineteenth, the odd man out, while the same
time would have earned twelfth place at last year’s
Midwest Conference Championships.

“The competition was very fast this year," Mc-
Millian said. “If you didn’t giile 100% effort in your
races, there was almost no chance of making it into
the ﬁnals."

Both teams are done with competition until they
meet Connecticut College on Jan 7 in Naples, Flora
ida in conjunction with the annual training trip, The
Grinnell Invitational will take place on the weekend
ofjan, l4, and the teams will host Coe and travel to
Loras before classes restart.

The Midwest conference Championships, which
Grinnell will host this February, are already on the
swimmersY minds. '

“[The] Dogs have recorded nine of the top 19
conference swims this season and the highest male
diving scores, and the Ducks have swum 13 ofthe 19
fastest times among women’s teams,”said iniddlcrdiSr
tance specialist Brian Clites ‘03.

“Both the men’s and women’s teams are looking to
destroy the conference this year. The other teams sim-
ply don't have the strength or depth that the Grinnell
team has,"McMillian said.
