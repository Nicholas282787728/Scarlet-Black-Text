Fabric fetish

Driers can be props to pose in as well as practical machines used to dry clothes, and
textiles aren’t only different types of fabric—they’re a whole genre of artistic possibility

by Josh Cooley

Chatlott: Hess‘s study of tcxtilcs was a ﬂuke,

When Hess ‘04 decided to study abroad last year, she originally wanted
to live in a Francophone country so she researched abroad programs in
Morocco and Senegal, hoping to study anthropology. She then decided
that she really wanted to study art but atter a tailed attempt. at seeuring a
study abroad program in holy, Hess was left with little time to ﬁnalize her
junior year plans. Even after deciding to spend her spring semester at the
Glasgow School otArt in Scotland, her ﬁrst ehoioe was to study painting

“l’ni not surprised i didn't get into the painting department," said
Hess, “becausel hadn’t done a lot of painting."

Hess was placed in her second»cholce d:pm’tm:n(, (Exllllt, and imm:»

every day from 9 a.rn..5 p.m. studying the cre—
ation of textiles and creating her own clothing
pieces after ﬁnding inspiration.

“I’d be reading a book or watching T.v., get
struck by an idea, and try to translate that idea
into fabric," said Hess, describing the beginnings
ofa typical textile crearion.

After returning to Grinncll, she knew that her
future in art was in rcxlllc design. She arranged an
independeat srudy in textile with Matt Kluber,
her Printmaking professor,

Hess always toyed with the ideas oteiothrng
design as art, in part because her mother was a model before Hess was
born and later worked in the Art Institute orChieago. Hess spent three
weeks in high school studying abroad at the American School in London
as part of an independent project, during which she eoneentrated on pho.
tography. This interest in photography developed into her latest exhibie
tron, Figure Studies, which was on display last week at the Forum gale
iery.

The cxhlbit contains everything From Polaroids ornude hurnan torsos
to woodcuts orgyrn shoes, Despite worlu'ng in varying rnedrurns, Hess
centered all her pieces on the human body, Taped on the walls are not
only the some 300-plus photographs that appeared in Hoss' 20oz exhibit,
but also 40 never befom sccn Polaroids that were taken in 2002 and 2004.

about the etbrbit but had never seen it.

“People would some up to the and say ‘Oh you‘re Charlotte, the girl
who did the Polaroids,” said Hess.

also shown in the torrn or iashron rllratrarrons which developed from
printed textiles that she created.

As a result orthe nudity present in her works, Hess has reeeived some
harsh criticism irorn community members. Indirrerent to these eensures,
she continues to visualize the nude human body from dinerent angles.
This year, however, she is increaoingiy roeused
on using these photographs as a .umpingotrpoint
for her work wlth textiles.

“I have an obsession with how the hurnan

explaining how her photography relates to her
interest in textiles.

A terrible album
you have to buy

reviewed I: do standi er
e white blood cells

You know you have one: an absolutely terrible
album that you absolutely adore. Somewhere in your
an case, you must have buried a copy of Britney
Spears or The snags. This is the category that the
White Stripes’ White Elaod Cells album falls into.
There's barely a drop orcreativity or talent anywhere
on the disk, but somehow it manages to keep you
listening to it at full volume over and over and ever
again.

It's obvious to people who don't like the White
stripes what exactly it is I'm talking about when I call
the duo taleutlcss. One or the ﬁrst things any anti-tau
could pick on is Jack White‘s voice. it is whiny.
unmeladic, and under most circumstances would be
signiﬁcantly irritating. He can't carry a note, let alone
a clear tune, His guitar skills are anything but
redeeming. white Stripes instrumentals are a
throwback to the age of punk when it was considered
a liability to know more than three notes on a given
instrument, Jack SllDWS that he does indeed possess
knowledge of how to use the 5-5tring contraption in
the acoustic song “We're Going to Be Friends," but
most or the songs end up a mass or repeated chords at
a pace that’s not exactly challenging. Meg White's
drumming abilities are not quite prodigious either.
This is a band that is characterized almost exclusively
by repetition and simplicity.

the White Stripes’ lyrics leave something to be
desired as well. The majority at the 15 songs on the
album stick to the uncriginal theme of estranged love,
and the representation itself of the topit is ﬁt from
poetic, or even logical. While nonsense can certainly
have its place in music. the listener gets the
impression that-the lyn‘cs are supposed to makes
sense. They just rail. Occasionally sentence fragments
or incomplete thoughts stand in the way, but more
often the culprit seems to be the songwriter
stretching just a bit to far to ﬁnd a rhyme. For
example, ”All you little kids, seem to think you know
just where it's at/ ooooh! I think I smell 3 Val.” simply
doesn't tie together well. And this is when the Whites
actually try, The lyrics of ”Aluminum” consist entirely
ofthe word ”aaaaaah!"

What’s not easy to describe at all is why White
Blood Cells is so damn loveable. Maybe the repetition
makes it easy to sing along to, or the unvarying beats
and simplistic lyrics make it easy to blast at top
volume rvrthout requiring any thought. Maybe there's
something homey and alluring about good old
lehashed garage rock, Maybe some or us are just sick
of listening to brilliant, talented artists. Whatever the
reason, the album is worth looking up on Phynd and
adding to your list or music you hate to love.
