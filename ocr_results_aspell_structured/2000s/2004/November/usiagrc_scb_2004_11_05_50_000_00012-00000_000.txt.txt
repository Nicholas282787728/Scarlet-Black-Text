Close to
home and in
your face!

For the last three columns, I have rat
tained a fairly wide perspective in my dist
turbcd ramblings, ignoring happenings in
our own neck of the woods (or rather, corn-
ﬁelds),

This is about to change. Yt- o/dc mun/:-

residents of Grinnclll

Don't worry, rhis critir
cism will be easy to swab
low - provided sufficient
humblc pic is available. As
a final disclaimer. this cola
not an ego trip for
me - just a bit of mental
stepping on toes,

This whole COCATCOIA
thing has some people in
quite the tizzy. Death squads in Columbia
and the college won't divest from the hast
tiirds until 2008?

Very strange indeed. or course, from
what a friend from Columbia tells
me, everyone and their uncle hitcs
death squads.

Not to offend any Columbians,
but gvvd grit/has the us. got that

is hardly more an act of
c'
liking cuttlcfish means
you watch tentacle
porn. The proper approach is a reasoned,
organized argument to the administration
with friciidly alternatives suggested.

1 like the idea or replacing coca-Cola
products with local store brands manufaca
tured in the Midwest. Not only does it keep
our sticky fingers out of Mcgacorporations,
but it supports local mans
uracturing, which needs
all thc hclp it can get. If
we could only find such an
easy solution for the death
squads. Next to go un—
der the sight is tht: ivholc
Hookah silly-business.
Joint Board meetings had
something ofthis issue for
nearly two months bcforc
slmoung it down for rcasons oravailahility
and liability.

Yes, i voted it down myself, so you can
bring on the hate—mail and dciith thi t s,
but not before the end of this Column.‘

I almost voted for it. after 11“, it was
only 3125 or so, and thugs have illlvityo cnr
tcrtaincd me (provided I wasn’t paitalting
or them). However, l'm at no mind to be
involvctl in any unncccssary legal proceeds
lugs, and the Grinnell Campus likely has
people in possession or hookahs out the
Wazoo.

Ofrcoursc, this would lit: a vii tunlly moot
point was mariiuana legal in the Unirctl
States, but that s a column tor iiitothci day.

The othci issue that came up during the
Hookah debate was whether it was “in the
spirit" of the SGA Constirntion to t‘und
the purchase of drug paraphernalia. as the

It was quite fun to see
some of the rough-
and-tumble liberals

of Grinnell attempt a

Back to SGA: for those ofyou who have

As is par for elections around

here, candidates put up a small

number of ﬂycrs with their

rcsumcs and/or posiuons on

them. Of course, there were

quite a few ﬂycrs put up.

This means that the ‘

I did see one Asian guy in thrn-ri of

he was ﬂying an AtWing.
As we all know, ArWings

all Rtbcl Alliance ﬁghters;
so the guy was probably
just there to pull it Wang

slam into an imperial Rc-

Anyway, I was also disr
appointed by the amount of negative signs,
particularly the oncs that said “SGA gave
31500 for the purchase of 6 hats and no
money for Grinnell Women in Scicnce and
Engineering. Nobody spoke out ovcr this."

This is lack of context at its worst.

Letter to

PreSIdent
Bush

Dear President Bush,

Your wcdnesday acceptance speech
reads like a George Orwell novel. The
speech was peppered with the usual
doublcspeak: a claim to have “restored
the vigor of the economy” as America
loses millions ofjobs and a claim to
have “served the freedom of all main
kind" as 1,100 American soldiers and
100,000 ltaq‘is lie dead from your mis-
guided war.

However, one statement particus
larly sticks out in our minds. “To every
person who voted for my opponent: To
make this nation stronger and better I
will need your support, and I will work

to earn it. I will
do all I can do [W]e speak
