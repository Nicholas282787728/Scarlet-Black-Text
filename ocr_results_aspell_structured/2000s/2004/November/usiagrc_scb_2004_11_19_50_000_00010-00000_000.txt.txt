The joy of broccoli

It‘s broccoli, baby!

I love this tree-like food, full of nutrients such as Vitamin
A, potassium and iolates However, I don't like it raw, and I
hate it overcooked, The solution: steaming,

Take two bowls ham the salad bar. Fill one with broccoli,
add 2-3 Tbsp. er water (ignore strange looks from those wait-
ing in line with glasses instead of bowls of vegetables), and
put the second bowl upside-down on top of the first. Hold
tightly and shake a bit to coat the veggies with waters

Microwave for one minute for crisp broccoli, longer if you
prefer it more well-done. Remove broccoli from water and

prepare the‘ rest of your dish If you're really a nutrient nut,

you should drink the broccoli waterl
Easy meal: broccoli, soy sauce, olive oil and sesame seeds
served with rice Eat with tofu or meat of your choice for

protein.

Try broccoli with:

—Baked potato, melted cheese and sour cream
—Creamy soups, such as broccoli cheese or cream of as

paragus

~—0ther steamed veggies: cauliﬂower, celery and carrots
(both take a bit longer in the microwave), green peppers,

peas or red cabbage

Sauces and spices for your veggies:

rChili powder, cumin, curry powder and tumeric

7A few drops of lemon juice mixed with olive oil, salt,
pepper, rosemary and thyme
