Even though you will probably have everything picked by the
time you settle in to read the Km? over break, some of (lien: travel
tips might come in handy for packing procrastinators or. Follow
them on your return trip, on laugh at them. The point of this page
is to provide you with mindless reading and useless information.
Happy spring break.

Roll, don’t fold
This reduces the amountof wrinkles
in your cloths, thio cutting down on
ironing time (but none of us iron uny-
thing anyway, so rolling your clothes
ensrrres that you look less like someone
who spent a week in the science build
ing without changing your clothes). It
you have several similar items, sud‘l as
pants, you can roll them together. l’ve
been told that “the space you can save is amazing!” You can also roll
yourclodaes athome, a trickl picked up on Queer Eye for the straight
Guy that allows you to see all otyour sweaters in the drawer at once
“Just like file folders."

Putting cardboard to good use

For any size suitcase:

1. put your luggage over a large piece ofurdboard. which you
can take trom the recycling room. Trace an outline and cut.

2. First, pack shoes, toiletries, hard items like tettboolts, etc.

3. Lay the cardboard divider on top of [lime items.

4. Stack your tolled clothes neatly atop the cardboard. Voila! You
can now find your toothth wrthour ruining your neat packing by
simply lifting the cardboard divider and clothes out oiyour suitcase!
Wow.

Zip it up

Put important documents, photos, jewelry and anything worth
more than 20 bucks in Zip-Lock bags. This keeps them together and
prevents them from getting dirty in your suitcase (haven't you ever
had a shampoo fiasco where all ofyour clothes were drenched with
Herbal Essence and you were forced to walk around smelling like a
garden for a week? Not good.) Even better, contain items that might
leak by following the next tip...

Another reason to drink coffee

Use empty plastic or metal coiree jars rot things that might spill.
A backpacker round this particularly usehil because usually liquid
items are used at the same time (shampoo, conditioner, cologne, ear.
sup, etc.) and packing breakables in them with some cloth will pro.
tcct them from being squashed (Those who like to ﬂirt with disaster

hi).

can put breakables and nice yewelry in the same pr as rheu liepird
toiletriesl). i don't know how this would work rryoiir shampoo is
standard size, but maybe iiyou use small bottles it will be efﬁcient,

Conceal valuables

lfyou have an expensive camera urany kind. consider buying a
diaper bag to carry it in instead ora
conspicuous camera bag with “Nikon"
written in big letters. The more pastel.
the better. I think, because what sicko
would steal a real diaper bag with pink
and yellow hearts on it? Another perk
to a diaper bag is that there are lots or
outer pockets that can be used for
snacks, change, water bottles and baby
wipes, er, tissues.

Fresh-smelling clothes

Didn‘t get a chance to do your laundry before you packed all at
your dirty clothe in your suitcase? Pack a few dryer sheets for a “just
wished" sensation when you open your luggage. or, as this website
suggests. to prevent “airplane odor" from yorir clothes. (Warning:
just like putting on perfume is not the same as raking a shower, this
should not be considered air alternative to ever washing your
clothes, , .it just buys you a couple more clays.)

How to pack shoes

For those truly paranoid about odors (Le. would never shove two
loads ofdirty clothes in a small suitcase that will sit in a dark, minty
luggage compartment for six hours without ventilation), try putting
each shoe in a cotton sock, Have big feet? Use the sleeves from an old
swcanhirt, This coverage prevents dirt from your shoe from getting
on your stuff and protects die shoe from being scratched. For the
overly-anal, put the sockecovered shoe in a Zip-Lock bag. No more
stinky suitcase!

Make your mark
My mom had a hideous brown suitcase from the sixties that had
a hard time staying shut, so she put an elastic rainbow luggage strap
around it. At age eleven. this easyetoespot eyesore was embarrassing,
but were old enough to be original now, so put something uniquc on
your suitcase to make it easy to spor. i suggest something mildly
oirensiye. or at least weird: tie a thong to the handle or slap on a
politically controversial bumper sticker (but make sure it doesn't say
anything about terrorists or bombs or else you will never see your
luggage again).

According to the us Department bi State bureau bi Consular Aiiairs,
"it is a good idea tor students to learn as much as they can at the
language of the country in which they plan to travel or study.
Learning basic phrases oi the language can be helpful, and it
indicates a willingness on the part of students to make an ettort to
communicate in the language oi the country," with this in mind, the
5&3 has come up with some usctul phrases in a few languages tor
your spring break excursions to taraway places.

Note: languages that don’t use the Roman alphabet have been
spelled phonetically so you can actually read it.

Botticelli: a good parlor (or airport) game or radio call-in show

Basic Play

One or more persons are “it" (or the “Brain
Trust" or whatever you’d like to call it). They drink
of a person (for example, Cathy, as in the comic
strip character of the comic ofthe same name) and
tell the initial letter to the other players (in this
we. “6”).

The other players try to think orpeople whose
names begin with “C”. Valid names include Cain,
Christopher Columbus, candyman, or Johannus
Climactus Candace Bergman would not be a valid
name 7 she is a "B" name.

Name can't be groupsorpeoplc leg. “McCoy’s"
as in Hatﬁeld: and McCoys is not valid for “M").
but anything else goes. Our house rules for things
like Frosty the Snowman and Kermit the Frog is
that they are “F" and K", respectively. Examples
otgood names are: Frosty the snowman, Dwight
D. Eisenhower, Mighty Mouse. Bad names: Major
Major Major Major, John Doe.

When one ofthe players thinks ofa name (for

example, Jimmy Carter). they need to think ota
way to clue it. in this case. our playe. might say “I
was a president orthe united states,”

The job of the person who is “it" is to guess
who the player is thinking or. in this case, they
might tupond “Bill Clinton," Even though that is
not what the player was thinking or. it is a valid
response and the player must further clarify their
clue before they can ask again.

The player might then say, "I was president or
the united states in the 1970's."

Assuming we have an "it" who is really clueless
about recent us. history, they will not know the
answer and will have to say so,

Then, the person who gave the clue tells them
who they were thinking or (in this case Jimmy
Carter) and they get a chance to ask a yes/no ques.
tion about the person otwhom “it" is thinking (in
our example this is Cathy).

The player might ask “Am I real?" and “it"
would respond “No.".

play continues in this manner until someone

thinks rhey know who the name is. Tlren they clue
it just like they would clue anyone else. in this ex.
ample, a player might say “Ami .1 comicsrrip char.
acter who is always worried about her weight?" If
the person who is "it" cannot think oranyone other
than their name that satisllcs the cheracteristic, drey
say, “orwhom are you thinking?”

lithe player thcn correctly identiﬁes the name
that “it" had in mind, that player become “it" for
a new round with a new name and a new letter.

Obscurity Rules

Obscurity rules are important but should also
be used sparingly, lithe person who is it is given a
name bya player that they thiiikcouldn't be known
by any reasonable human being, then they can call
obscurity (for example, the brother ofthe wife or
the blacksniidr who shoedV/mhington’s grey horse).
This rarely happens in party play, since it is usually
u result otsotneonc listening in to the radio broad.
catt and looking tip names in a book (that behav—
rot is Frowncd upon)

There are also obscure clues, For example, “i
am in a movie which his the same name as he title
character in air italian opera set in a city which is
featured in a 1985 movie directed by the man who
directed an almost identrcal movie ten years later:-
No human being can be expected to parse this,
much less know it.

Choosing good names (for “it”) and
clues for the players

A good name springs readily to mind (for ex.
ample, Robert Maplerhorpe was used in a recent
gums: although it was known by many people, it
did not readily spring to mind).

Keep in mind that people torn only ask yes and
no questions and it will take tirem a while to arrive
at the name.

Coming tip with obscure people that the per-
son who is it hasn't heard ofis pretty easy. Cluing
names that they do know in a way they won't guess
isn’t
