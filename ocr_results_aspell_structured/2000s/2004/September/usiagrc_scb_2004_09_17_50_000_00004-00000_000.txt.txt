KDIC off air, awaiting FCC approval for antenna move

BV MAC POHANKA

So {at this year,ifstudents turn their dial to 88,5 FM,they’ll
get nothing but blank air KDIC, the Griaacli College raeho
statron, is now arvaitrng Federal Cornnrunicarrons- Cornrnissron
(FCC) approval for moving their antenna, and could be came

With the destructron oi‘Darby Gymnasium this past slime
met, KDIC moved into a new home in Younltci Pit Lounge,
The station is planning to move rnto the Joe
Rosenﬁcld Strident Center when it is lint
ishedt

In June, before Darby was torn down, the
collcge contracted Shocn Construction Coin-
pany to move the broadcasrrng antenna for
the station from the gym to atop the cooling
plant next to Noyce. As a part otrhe contract
Shoen was also to he in charge of tiling all
necessary paper'work with the FCC, who are

Any time a radio station wishes to make major changes,
including changes in equipment, the FCC must not only be
notified, biit they miist also approve the change through a long
tiling process rnc'lrrtlrng lots orappl‘rcarions and a revrew offiles.
The review process itselrcan take as long as six months, Sims
says, But before a change or proposal goes up tor review it is
filed and publicly posted on the FCC web site.The KDIC pri-

pcrwork was not posted.

Shoen says that last June when they
moved the antenna, they submitted all the
necessary paperwork to the FCC. Now, three
months later, it appears on the FCC web
site that they still have not received it, make
rag the new location useless untrl approval is
granted, Sims says that this sort ofthing is a
"typical problem in dealing with the FCC,"
and that the school is working to fix
Tire college has hrted several lawyers tram New York Cirv
and Washington D C. to handle the paperwork and legal probc
iems. Their main task rs to speed up and secure the process or
reﬁlling the antenna paperwork with the FCC.

Unfortunately, as Sims and station manager Graeme Millet

‘oo agree, “The FCC rs a bigger bureaucracy than people can
ever irnagrne, and rt is going to rrke some time Because it is
very hard to tell how qluc ldv things will move with the FCC,
Miller and Sims estimated that [\DIC could return to the m,
waves any time between the end at September and the end or
the semester.

1(1)le other major problem with the FCC is that their
permanent broadcasting license runs out in February. Without
that. not even the antenna problem can be solved According [0
Sims, the goal right now is to do three things First rs to have
the FCC acknowledge the paperwork tor the tower move," he
said. “Next is to get a temporary broadcasting license to protect
the station during the review process for their new irccrrse, and
then lastly to get the full liccnscd renewal approved

He rlro says that the school rs dorng all rt can to get the sta-
tion up and running. not onlv tor the students, but also because
ofrhc substantial investments already put into the station.

‘Thc hardest thing is being able to have all this information
about the problem, but still not being able to move forward,
especially with all the students who have already been granted
shows but can’t go on the air," Sims said, “And hopefully we
will be up by fall break."

Rosenﬁeld speaker Tom Melia advocates
of democracy

American promotion

On Tuesday afternoon, Torn Melia,
the ﬁrst speaker of the Rosenneld Sympo-
sium “The State ofDemocracy in the 2004
World," gave a speech askrng “15 George
Bush Serious,> Can the United States F057
ter Democracy Abroad?"

Malia, a longtime veteran of efforts to
promote democracy overseas, has served in
a number of positions, including that of
vice president, otrhe National Democratic
Institute (NDI),

The Rosenﬁcld Program in Public
Affairs, International Relations, and Hu-
man Rights sponsored the program. Tire
program aims to “promote campus discuss
Sion on important policy topics," according
to Rosenﬁeld Program Drrectot Wayne
Meyer.

Q. were: were mine afl/Je (lying; you and

A. We provided naming about politit
cal activism in several realms. One is with
political parties, [We’d] work with demot
ctptic political parties in other countries

how you burld an organization, how
you talk to voters, how you develop policies,
etc. We’d also work with civic groups to be
watchdogs on their own electrons educatt
rug citizens on their own democracy.

Q Yam we til/c rat/tr r/ite us. really

rate?

A My approach to this rs that yes [we]
can help foster democracy in other count
tries although 1 rn not sure the current ad
ministration has ﬁgured out the rrght way
to do that.

Q. So it sew-gr but/r terrain?

A.Thc suppnr r tor democratic develop
ment rn other countries is a longstanding
American tradition, but a minor one
never been as prominent in thetoti

' the government as rt has been in this one.

Q. How (rm we SPm’lﬁru/ly [)i‘wnatt' Ilk’
warmly?

A. I think in the ﬁrst instance by being
a model ofa working dernoctae , ..I dont
mean proclaiming that the U. S. is the ideal
form or democracy rn the world. In tact,
what rs more useful in this cause is to say
that we're a work rn progress. a

I think if we acknowledge that in our
work internationally, that would create a
more appropriate and erreetrvc way ottalk-
ing about the ways that other countries can
improve their democratic processes.

Q, Do you ”not are US. tan tarpon de-
mommy/lam above? were dorr ﬁle/mule bald
far our attempt reﬁne demanmy on 17/17 and
Afgbanirmii?

A.The experience ofJapdn after World
war it demonstrates that democracy can be
imposed. i think it's pretty clear. The milrt
my action in Iraq was nothing like the war
in Japan; that was total war and the rcgrme
was totally discredrted.

I don’t think democracy can be imposed
on the cheap or quickly... a more etteerive,
tnote susrrrnable way of doing it would be
responding to the expressed wishes or the
people in those Countries, Most people in

SPARC, com. from p. l

SPARc’s initial reaction to Crady's pros
posnl was negative. Committee member Mark
Gardiner '05 believes his opposition to the
idea is justified in both practical and theoreti-
cal terms. “We've put together a pretty broad
set of proposals for increased accountability
and openness, but there are two key issues for
ine,"hc said.

“First, ifthe question is accountabrlrtyto the
student body, surely a directly elected commit-
tee is more representative than the SGA Films
Committee... which is an unelccted body. Sec»
end, it‘s just a basic freedom of the press issue,
SGA is all over [llC place and is involved in all
parts otcampus life [that the media covets]. It
is a bad idea in principle for student govetnr
ment to control campus media."

Until the early 19905, SPARC was part
ot’ SGA, and publications and radio did not
receive a designated portion or the student
Activities Fee Crady does not recall any
problems with media independence under this
system. He suggested that SGA would vote on
the SPARC budget in its entirety and not on
an itemized basis. He also did not expect the
amount of money received by KDIC and cam-
pus publications to changc signiﬁcantly,

Gardiner said that the Sept, 3 rneetrng was
the ﬁrst time he had heard of this proposal
from Student Affairs, though last semester
SGA members met with SPARC to discuss a
similar proposal

acob KaufmarrOsbor'n ‘04 bcgan by
thinking that combining SPARC was a good
idea, but after sewing as both SPARC busit
ness manager and SGA treasrrrer, changed his
mind. “I think it’s the worst idea cver,"he said.
“If they [combined them], theyd need a full
time staftmembci.”

Until the early 1990s, SPARC was a part
of SGA, and publications and radio did not
reecrvc a designated portion of the Student
Ar: vit < Fee, \Vhilt: Crady was instrumental
i ind lug SPARC independent and stressed
that this vents committee is better than many
others he and Ktolm cited several problems rn
the years since their separation, including the
disappearance of expensive equipment, debt
and rhis_ 's yearbook problems.

Th‘ it the iirsr year the yearbook has
experienced problemsThe 1990 Cyr’IO/Il, pulr
lislied while under SGA jurisdiction, had sect
trons otblank pages, causrng a slew oi‘aceusat
tion among staff members the following year.

Crady, who will make the anal dc on on
whether to combine the organizations, said
one option would be to have a group ofsru-
dents and staff members convene and make a
recommendation to him.

As for the mo rte charge ofinadt

Cyclone. Gardrner acknowledged that the Com-
mittee had to rake some responsibility “Vi’e
drdnt oversee the publication closely enough,"
he said. We should have been checking and
nrakr urc Mitch [Herzl was on track orgrv-
en him rncentive to ﬁnish rt or to help him out
in some wry So I think there are legitimate
concerns that a large—budget publication hasn't
come out on time.”

on Wednesday, SPARC presented sew
cral changes in its operation. In an interview
previous to the meeting, Gardiner outlined
SPARCs plan of action SPARC plans to
monitor the publications more closely by re
quiring production schedules from the media
heads. VVcte drawrng up contracts with the
media heads that lay oirt their responsibilities
and what recourses we have concerning are
ing them or suspending them or suspending
the publication," said Gardiner, “ultimately, rn
extreme cases, taking them to JudCo (Judicial
Committee),"

SPARC also plans to meet more regu-
larly and publicize its meetings. Although the
meetings are already open to the strident body,
Gardiner said that it was unlikely that other
snrdcnts would attend the meetings since
tliizv were generally called on an ad hoc basis.
SPARC plans to publish the meeting minutes
as well, “which we should have been doing all
along,“he said.

Furthermore, Gardiner said, “We already
made a commitment last semester to present
a budget to Joint Board and make it public
in that way." Jornt Board would not vote on
the budget, “To let them vote on rt is pretty
much what Ton-r [Crady] would want," said
Gardiner.

SPARC is eurrendy in the process of
amending their constitution and bylaws. It may
include a provision requiring all other bylaw
changes to be voted on by the student body, as
with SGA constitutional :inrienditients

SPARC members oppose the idea or int
corpotatrng SPARC into SGA. though they
do call for more input from the students.

After the second Wednesday meeting,
SPARC members thought the p sib ty of
merging with SGA was less likely. iele was
more of ii dialognlc," said SPARC committee
member Steve Ford 05.‘ \Ve understand them
inoi‘etThey understand its more We’re moving
toward a good resolution I think,"

“We‘ve been passrvely open," Cardrner
said, “wrth these changes, we will be actively
open."

he said “SPARC has made some suggestions;
