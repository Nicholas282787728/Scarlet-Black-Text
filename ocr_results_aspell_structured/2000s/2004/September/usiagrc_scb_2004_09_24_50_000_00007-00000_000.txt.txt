Dodgebal A ue Underdog Story (R)

If ever a movie demands the clink
of beer bottles rolling down the Harris
aisles as its patrons drink tlreir my to
enjoyment in spite ofwhat's happening
on the screen, Dodge/mil is that movie,

This slrot-to-the-groin of a movie
stars Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn as
rival gym owners, with Stiller as the
rich, ripped jerk and Vaughn the poor,
pudgy, polite guy To stop Stiller from
buying his gym, Vaughn and his band
of Average Joe's enroll in a televised,
cash—prized Dodgeball tournament,
because those never happen. Not to be
out-camped, Stiller’s gym also puts a
team in the tournament, Along for the
ride is Stiller’s wife Christine Taylor,
teptising her role in Zia/(1min as the
nottfunny professional woman. Let the
celebrity cameos begin!

Stiller, Vaughn and Taylor belong to
a nebulous comedic constellation along
with Will Ferrell and Owen and Luke

Touching the Void (R)

Recent documentary films have
reached great heights while stretching
the genres borders. Are essays about
how much President Bush sucks or
how many Big Macs a guy can swallow
documentaries? Yes, popular ones. 1s
staged footage spliced together with in—
terviews of gung-ho mountain climbers
a documentary? That’s debatable, but it
is a thrilling movie.

Touching r114 Void recounts the story
otJoe Simpson and Simon Yates, a pair
or mountain climbers who attempted
to climb the west Face ofSiula Grande
in Peru in 1985. Tethered together and
climbing on powder, Joe and Simon
set out to be the first men to scale the
21,000’f00t peak, Getting to the top
isn't the hard part, though,because 80%
of all climbing accidents occur on the
descent.That’s comforting.

To convey both the cocky personr
alities ofJoc and Simon and the terri—
fying conditions of scaling mountains,

Wilson that seems to turn out five mow
ies a year that range from great (ZN/n
under) to merely watchable (Dungeon/l.
Their movies are formulaic Saturday
Nrgthi'l/z material, and I would love to
tear into them, except that they know
how to tell bad jokes really well.

Little in Dodgeba/I is unique, plot
gressive or memorable, brrt as a whole,
it is enjoyable. Stiller’s buffoon is neir
ther funny nor treacherous, but Vaughn
rs likeable enough, and his Average Joe’s
tap into enough cliche’s,such as the male
cheerleader, the pirate, the skinny loser,
the loser with glasses and the black guy,
that they can almost catty scenes. Like
Blur 07‘qu and Tomb Raider, Dodgwall
is the perfect study breakiall you need
to provide is the alcohol.

And please, find a recycling room
for those empty bottles.

director Kevin MacDonald employs a
unique structure in Toasting II): Void.
He blends present-day interviews with
Joe and Simon with re-shot footage of
actors climbing up and falling down
mountains. Both are brilliant. We get
to know Joe and Simon better than
any screenwriter could translate them
and the staged closctups and suspense
MacDonald manufactures puts the MIT
dience in their boots.

The beginning of Tam/ling [be Void
plays comparable to the stolid lMAX
movie Ewrzsl, but as Joe and Simon
make their descent from the peak, the
intrigue really picks up. Tragedy strikes,
and though we know they both sure
vive (hence the interviews), yon will
he amazed at the determination they
show in getting down that mountain
to safety. This little independent film
has everyrlung you’d want from a big
blockbuster.

Master & Com-
mander: the Far
Side of the World
(PG-13)

Russell Crowe once again pays homage to himself,
this time in Winner ('3 Comm/rude), in which lie come
mands British sailors, who repeatedly attack a French
war-ship. Off the set, he commanded them too; they
had to dress according to their nautical rank even in
social gatherings (the bastard). This Oscarrwrnning
ﬁlm borrows its story flom a bookof the same name,
but the screenwriters changed the original antagonists
from Americans to Frenchmen. We'd naturally have a
tough time cheering for the British as they harm us.

This movie is about warfare, but does not involve
dozens of ships: the same two ships repeatedly meet
and duke it out. Our perspective stays with the Brit»
ish ship,and the story plays out through the triumphs
and failures ofthe Brits.Wc don't meet the French, so
they may as well be evil robots. Even Saving Private
Ryan featured a Nazi neatly weeping after sniping an
American soldier, and Saving Private Ryan's director
is Jewishl That’s the whole point of win movies, that
no one’s had, everyone fights to survive.

Most ofthe battle sequences are confusing and lit
tered with wood chunks.Two boats file cannons, and
here’s what happens: i) explosions, 2) ilying wood, 3)
horizontally ﬂying people.

Yes that‘s right, these people don’t ﬂy up, they fly
across. When we eventually see hand-to-hand coili-
hat, there’s too much smoke to see whats going on.
There's punching, shooting, and stabbing, but who's
killing who? You don't really know until it's over. That
is not suspenseful, it’s boring.

a little cheat sheet, a vocabulary list ofscmltoutdalcd
ship lingo.They use four or ﬁve words that I've never-
heard before, and it doesn’t help that they're talks
ing British. You may know port (left) and starboard
(light) from other movies. but this movie uses lart
board instead of port. Oakum is “a substance used to
caulk leaks in ships," taffrail is “the rail around the
back or a ship,” and I have no clue what topgallant
means, but learn it anyway and you’re set to go.
