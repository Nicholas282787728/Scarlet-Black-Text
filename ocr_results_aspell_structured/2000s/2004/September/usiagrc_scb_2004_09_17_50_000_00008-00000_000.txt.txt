Run out of clothes> Have no fear, Coral Ridge
and Jordan Creek Malls are here (nearby enough,
anyway). Come visit the best places in Iowa to see
people acting as people, Come see rhe tloppy hugs
and grabs ofthe ass that scream “I am humanl"

Malls: only available in limited locations Take a

Jordan Creek Mall of West Des Moines. You enter
this formerrwetlands tulned supermall and have
within your grasp 32 stores never before seen in
lowal

Take a left onto l—SO West from 146 and you're
but a stone’s throw away from Coral Ridge Mall
of Caralville (and you won’t get lost, there are two
clearly marked exirs). After a few quick turns you
will have arrived at one of rhe most laid-back malls
in all of Iowa with above average
selection,

Which srores you shop at will
dictate your fashion sensibilities
this season. Hot Topic is pushing
the “early nineties" in the form of
Mighcy Morphin Power Range
crs nylon jackets, while Hollister
boasts that “all the colors you see
in this store are in this season: burgundy (there was
no burgundy in the store!), lighr hlue, and nor black,
deﬁnitely not black."

The punk stores at the mall disagree. Stores like
Hot Topic, Gadzooks and Journey have items with
the prearranged color combination of hot pink and
black, perrecr for the subversive mall shopper.

Old Navy and the Gap carry “basic wardrohe
pieces" for everyone. No matter where you shop
though, faded, torn and bleach-spotted jeans are
available and in-sryle. Jusr imagine rhe Laorian
sweatshop worker: “You want me to do what to these
jeans?" “Uh, yes, and if you could get those bleach
spots in the shape ofa heart, that'd be great."

People do nor go co the mall exclusively ro buy
clorhing. Many mall shoppers go wirhour speciﬁc
shopping goals, just for the “fun orshopping." The
mall is a place where people who have little in eome
mon other than shared blood can go to spend time.
Families meet up at these mails from all parts of
Iowa. The majority of customers we interviewed at
Coral Ridge were not from Iowa City.

The one man we spoke to who ms from Iowa

The Taj Ma Mall

With two malls within an hour of Grinnell, S&B reporters set

, out to the new Jordan Creek Mall in Des Moines and the Coral
Ridge Mall in Coralville to discover what makes malls so great,
what they’re selling and who’s shopping at them

City did not consider himselfa “rypical mall shop-
per." He was then: because it was rho only place in
rown to buy eyeglasses. And whar qualiﬁes him as an
atypical mall shopper: he blames rhe mall (or decon-
trollzation ofcommunity in rown and hares rhar rho
mall has caused many ofdowntown businesses to go
bankrupt (not to mention the fact that “now that I
come to think of it, mills are deﬁnitely a part of the
war over oil"),

The Jordan Creek parking lor was also full oroure
ofrtowners.The residents of Polk County were split
into two groups: the shoppers ochst Des Moines
and the workers ofDes Moines.The ratio ofLatiuo/
a custodian workers in the food court to the number
of Latino/a ingesters and digesters was 10:1.

As cold as rhe fancyepanrs West Des Moines
mall seemed to the more laidhack Colal Ridge Mall,
it still managed to toothpick-over six free samples of
chicken.Then,vvhen I asked some
girl ifl could finish her meal she
said, “okay sure."

But seriously, Jordan Creek
is overrun by "Jordan Creek
township" badgeewearing secue
rity guards and its marble ﬂoors
breathe iee. Even the playground
has a security guard to arrange the
little children’s shoes, godvforbid they trip. Thanke
fully, the mall does feature an indoor waterfall to
compensate for the destroyed wetlands.

The Coral Ridge Mall is less pretentious and has
maintained a more freshvfaced verdant consumers
ism. “We just love the variery here," sang a Cedar
Rapids resident.

“Mall shoppers are usually nice people,"ieporred
a thoughtful Panda Express worker.

“Most orrhe huys here are Impulse Buys,”hoasr-
ed the Sprint clerk.

When asked if the purchasers of“]esus is My
Homeboy" shirts are just being ironic, the sales
clerk's eyebrows twitchcd in confusions

But even nice Coral Ridge is just a mall, a dose
tination unto itself. It is full of consumers wearing
clothing previously purchased at the mall.Teenagers
at the mall consider shopping “fun," but also “com
petitive.” At the mall, all clothes sold are fashionable.
Differentiation resrs in price and hemline.

So are malls reallyjust a part ofthe war over oil?
You’ll have to come and see tor yourself.
