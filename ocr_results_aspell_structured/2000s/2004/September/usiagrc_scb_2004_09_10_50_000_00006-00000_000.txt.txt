Qurlls (R)

I learned as much from the
screaming match my parents had
about Guile as I did from the ﬁlm
itself. My mother was thrilled to
share with my younger sisters
and I this historical tale of one
man's compulsion to create his
art. My father sat down to watch
it with us, and by the end he was
furious.

Maybe it was because he saw his
daughters admiring the Mar-
quis de Sade, the ﬁlthy French
writer and the namesake of
sadism. Watching Geoffrey Rush
portray de Sade as a tortured
artist cooped up in a mental
institution, we sat there awed
by his persistence. With the aid
of a couple of cute kids—Kate
Winslet as the laundry maid and
Joaquin Phoenix as Father What
a Wasteithe Marquis sends his
ﬁlthy manuscn'pts out to the
world. In spite of Napoleon’s
decrees against it, he smuggles
his works out in towels, scribbles
them in blood and dictates them
to the outside world in a strange
game of telephone. His last gro—
tesque attempt to ”express him-
self " is probably what ignited
my parent’s ﬁght. It’s strangely
moving, to say the least.

auiUs is, in some ways, a pretty
standard "historical ﬁlm.” Plot
hides beneath muttered dialogue,
character development, and 19th
century bust lines. 0n the other
hand, it leaves out much of de
Sade’s criminally violent insan-
ity, which would likely deter us
from respecting his character in
the way this movie allows us to.

The Princess Bride (G)

I grew up with fire Princess Bride.
Just like the Nintendo-playing Fred
Savage, my mind would be put

at ease by the tale of Wesley and
Buttercup whenever my body was
diseased. So I can subjectively say
that thi ‘s the pinnacle of adventure
movies.

The Princess Bride has everything.
Pirates, pn'ncesses, swordfighi's; foul
beasts, a happy ending and, again,
Fred Savage playing Nintendo.
Grinnell has a very diverse cam-

pus, but on some front we should
be homogenous. We all should do
community service, we shouldn’t eat
Christian children, and we should
all see The Princess Bride. If this
happened, we’d all be friends. If you
didn't know someone. you could just
walk up to them and say "Hello, my
name is Inigo Montoya. You killed
my father: prepare to die."
Ah, Grinnell would be a blessed uto-
pia. Especially if we could get Fred
Savage to enroll.

‘ situations in which self-expres-
sion is so highly valued.1t came
out in 2000, but if de Sade were
around during the Bush adminis-
tration, he’d likely have problems
with the Patriot Act. Quilb could
be seen as a story of censorship
and the ﬁerceness with which
many of us cling to the all-impor»
tant freedom of speech.

The sadomasochism of de Sade
is far from the American pop»
culture leather and latex S/M we
know today. The implications of
Ouilu are more than sexual, too.
The ﬁlm is thought, and ﬁght,
provoking. My mother loved the
obsessive need to express oneself
that the ﬁlm's Marquis was bur-
dened or blessed with. Whether
you will feel burdened or blessed
by the characters. the Film, and

rFahrenheit 9/11 (R)

Don't listen to John McCain. Michael Moore is

not a disingenuous ﬁlmmaker. He is actually

a very smart man. He packaged stock footage

of our leaders in Washington and the Iraq

war, improbable yet likely conspiracy theories

and a few interviews with everyday Americans
(some of whom hold political office), added his
Michigan charm and wit, and created what was
unquestionably the event movie of the summer.
He has almost singlerhandedly made documentary
films both accessible and popular. Before you
begin to cn'tique the content and methods of his
movies, you have to give this boy from Flint some
credit. .

Fahrenheit 9/11. the most successful documentary

 

of all time, at least commercially, is Moore's
scathing essay on the Bush Administration's
connections to the Saudi royal family and mistakes
both in in responding to the September 11 attacks
and planning and executing the war in Iraq.

Most of his information—no, it's not all made
up—has been available in books and magazines,
but there’s nothing quite like the moving image,
especially when Controlled by Moore, He is superb
atjuxtaposing picture and sound for comedy, such
as playing The Go~Go‘s "Vacation" over footage

of George W. Bush‘s extended vacation during

the first eight months of his presidency. Yet he is
equally deft at undercutting this silliness with truly
shocking scenes, suck as the majority of the section
on Iraq, which he reportedly toned down to prevent

audiences from crying excessively.
Fahrenheit 9/11 is a signiﬁcant, poignant
movie, and you should see it. Vour political and
journalistic beliefs likely will Color your opinion
of Moore’s argument. Given the law of averages.
in the vast quantity of condemnations Moore lays
at Bush, at least some of what he’s saying has to
be correct. Ultimately, Moore tries to do too much
with this ﬁlm. His two best films, Roger & Me and
Howling ﬁvr [olumbine have very focused plots.
With this essay, though, he tackles too many
topics, and can't create a cnherent thesis other
than Bushie and his buddies are bad.
Which isn't the worst thing to be shouting from
the rooftops.
