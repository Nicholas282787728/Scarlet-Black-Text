Emphasis on exercise brings new
ﬁtness opportunities

Sel'cial college projects aimed at giving
Grinnellians better opportunities to exercise
are currently in the works. Many otthc specific
fitness improvements came from the recom-
mendations of the Mental Health Task Force.

New facilities include the new basketball
courts by East Campus, the refurbishing of the
volleyball courts near South Campus, a tune
nlng path currently in construction north of
the tennis courts, the new bike path to Rock
Creek, and the ﬁtness center to be built in the
new PEC.

Jonathan Brand, vice president of instimr
tional and budget planning, expressed cont‘r
dance that students would take advantage of
these new facilities. “Grinnclhans are more
and more focused on exercising," he said.

Vice President for Student Semces Tom
Crady explained that the college wants “to be
very intentional about what we offer students,
and cncouragc people to participate."

The bike trail to Rock Creek was a come
munity initiative that the college chose to supr
port. “The campus and the community come
together over the arts, our commitment to the
location, and athletics,” said Bland, ehaiacter-
izlng the efforts as an important part ofcom-
munity relations,

Negotiation begin next week as
Grinnell strikers return to work

Throughout the winter, spring and sum-
mcr, employees of Engineered Plastics cor-
poration (EPC) manned a picket line outside
their place of employment.

Last May, EPC workers, sponsored by
Students; Against Sweatshops (SAS) came on

.campus to speak to students about the strike.

The woikers, organized under UAW Amal-
gamated Local 997 ofNewton, Iowa, also op-
erated a strike kitchen in downtown Grinnell.

On August 10, after almost eight months
on strike, the EPC strikers went back to work

The workers agreed to come back to work
without a coiitract.'l‘hey are scheduled to meet
next week to negotiate with the company. Ted
Johnson, vice president ofLocal 997, is hope
ful that the workeis and EPC can work out an
agreement: "l‘ve got to be optimistic," he said.

According to johnson, the workers want
on strike bccause of unfair working conditions
and labor practices Specifically, the workers
felt that EPC unfairly targcted and fired union
leaders among the workers.

Walkers also alleged that EPC used othei
\illtlci'l'lm‘ldcd tactics in discouraging union
organization, including issuing payroll checks
that bounced and telling workers they would
be punished rewarded depending on wheth»
er or not they voted to unionize EPC workers
joined the UAW Oct 4 2003,

johnson said thc strike ended, in par t,
due to the National Labor Relations Boaid’s
(NLRB) ruling in favoi of the workers. “We
won overwhelmingly on those labor charges,"
he said.

judge Benjamin Schlesinger ruled in the
case that EPC succeeded in eliminating the
union's leaders through “unlawful, pretextual.
and some blatantly false reasons to sustain its
many discharges."

In the UAW magazine, Solidarity, Johir
son described the obstacles the workers faced:
“After being subjected to daily employer in—
timidation, a bombardment of antirunion pro-
paganda and Witnessing nine of their co-work—
ers illegally fired for pro-union activities, the
employees of Engineered Plastic Components
never stopped showing their grit and determir
nation."

In Solidarity, Danny Watndord, a member
of the plant‘s UAW organizing committee,
claimed that employees were sexually harassed
and “men and women alike were cursed and
belittled on the shop ﬂoor by the entire man-
agement team, including the Owner."

Alter the workers went on strike, EPC
hired replacement workers, a practice which
Johnson said rs common when workers go on
strike. However, the company could not legally
hire permanent replacements since the union
was on strike not for economic issues, but foi
unfair labor practices. “Th scabs had to go
when we came back,”he said.

According to Johnson, the company's busi-
ness has weakened tremendously from the
stri owcver, the wor ers suffered economic
hardships as well, hc sa' Although thc union
helped pay for some or the workers' costs, they
still did not receive a full paycheck, and many
people couldn’t ﬁnd othcl work while being
unemployed."

According to johnson, the workers aie glad
to have their jobs back.
