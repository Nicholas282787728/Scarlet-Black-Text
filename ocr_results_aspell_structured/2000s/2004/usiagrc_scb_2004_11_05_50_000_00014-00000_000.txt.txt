ﬁfth at Nationals

Grinnell’s water polo, "the best team of the past four years,"
has a strong ﬁnish at the Division III Nationals in San Antonio

After ending their Conference play undefeated,
the Wild Turkeys, Grinnell's meed water polo team,
placed fifth at the Division 111 national tournament
held in San Antonio, Texas on Oct. 29-31.

The Turkeys lost their ﬁrst game on Friday 12-9
to New York University, surrendering a game tied at
halftime. They suffered the same secondrhalf fate to
Lindenwood University on Saturday in a 977 defeat.

They did, however, beat St. John's University on
Saturday night to capture the number five spot at the
national tournament. That game also came down to
the wire, with Ali Tiriz ‘08 and Justin Wallace ‘05
making the last two shots and securing a lead for
Grinnell in the last 30 seconds or play. Wallace also
blocked a shot as time ran out, assuring that the grime
would not advance to overtime.

“There were six teams at nationals this year, which
is the lowest it’s been in the past four years," Brian
Clites ‘05 said. “They’re trying to shrink the number
to increase the quality of the teams, and even though
we didn't do as well [at nationals] as we had hoped, we
still have the best team ofthe past four years"

Their undefeated conference play was due in large
part to talented ﬁrst-years, many of whom were re-
cruited from the swim team and had never played
water polo before,

Seniors:

“There was a very positive dynamic, because the
ﬁrst year players helped break up the intensity of the
more experienced players," Clites said, “The most
rewarding part or the season was seeing those new
player get so much better."

One standout was Titiz, an international student
from Turkey who played on the junior national team
in his home country Titir. was named secondntcarn
AlleAmerican.

The Turkeys can also attribute their succcess to
increased interest in the sport—team attendance is
the highest that it’s ever been, and rit least 14 players
were at every practice. With such a large amount of
time spent in the water together, the team inevitably
became close.

“It is clear that the team has a unique sense or
unison both in the pool and out of the pool," Titiz
said. "There is just so much spirit in this ream,The
fact that everybody is willing to play water polo {or
‘fun’ makes the game a lot more fun. And when the
team is having tun, success comes along.”

And when the match is getting right and the play-
ers arc fatigued, Darryl Neurcld ‘05 starts singing an
oldies song and “the stress is gone and the team is
more ready to dominate the opposition than_ever,”

Titiz said.
