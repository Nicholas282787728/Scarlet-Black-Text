One month ago, amidst a ﬂurry of discu5v
sion concerning SGA elections and Election
Board practices, Marko Mirceric ‘05 proposed
a series of Constitutional reforms that would
change some long-standing SGA practices.
This week, his proposal was finally passed,
and the changes will take effect next semester.
The Joint Board senator for offrcampus none
college-owned houses said this plan would
make Election Board a “more autonomous
body.”

In order to be adopted, Constitutional rc-
forms must be approved by twonhirds of Joint
Board for two weeks in a row. The reforms
were approved for the second time almost
unanimously, with only Mircetic abstaining.

The primary change Mircerie proposed
would separate Election Board leadership
from Cabinet positions. According to the
previous guidelines in the SGA Constitur
tion, Election Board is made up of two Joint
Board senators, an unspeciﬁed number of
studentseatelarge, and two cabinet members.
The SGA Administrative Coordinator is the
designated chair of Election Board, and the
Student Services Coordinator also serves on
the Board If the Administrative Coordinar
tor should run for office, the Strident Services
Coordinator takes over as chair of the Board.
“It's not a good idea to have the Elec-

the scarlet and black

Joint BOard passes Election Board reforms

Constitutional bylaw change separating Election Board chair from Cabinet passes almost unanimously

tion Board run by an Administrative
Coordinator,“ said Mircctic, “The AC oft
rcn runs for office...so it really doesn’t make
sense to have him at that post.” In recent
years, Mircetic's observation has been borne
out. Former SGA VP Andy Grimm (for-
merly '05) was the AC for president Liz Allan
‘04‘5 administration last year. Allan was AC
under President Alejandro Oyarzabal ‘04, who
also served as AC before being
elected president.

Now the AC will have a
much reduced role in next se-
mester’s elections Mircetic’s
reform strikes the section in
the SGA Constitution which
makes the AC the chair of
Election Board. Because
Election Board is usually ap»
proved by Joint Board, Mirce-
tic has added a section in the
Constitution that puts the AC
in charge ofthe first semester senator elections
only.

One of Mircetic's amendments re-
quires the members of Election Board to be
established by the second regular session of
Joint Board, After an Election Board is ape
pointed by the President and Vice President
and approved by Joint Board with a two thirds
majority, a non-cabinet member will be made

“It‘s not a

Board run

to have the Election

ministrative Coordi-
nator. The AC often

runs for office."

While the Election Board reform is dcr
signed to reduce the inﬂuence of the AC on
the board, Mircetic said his reforms are not
a result of the actions of current AC Mike
Maloney ‘05. He drafted the reforms largely
in response to concerns from constituents, he

he's good, but you draft these

in mind."
“Ipcrsonallyfeelstrongr

stitutional level," he added.
The amendment fol-
lows questions about the
make—up of Election Board,
specifically why previous
members of Election Board
were not invited to be on this
year's Board. Maloney said
that he contacted everyone on a list left by
Grimm of people who had been members of
Election Board or had helped out with elec-
tions last year,

Grimm said later in an interview with the
SUB that Election Board members were on
the list,

Grimm also praised the constitutional
changes, not out of discomfort with the cure

lent Election Board but because they update
out-of-date bylaws. “Election Board has been
around a while and needs to be revamped a
little bit." he said, All of the Election Board
stuffwus written prerBlackboard so a lot ofit
just really isn’t relevant." He said that the old
Constitutional guidelines for Election Board
“came into existence because large numbers
of people were needed," referring to when all-
campus votes were done on paper ballots and
Election Board’s primary responsibility was
counting ballots. Now, he says, the main prie
ority of Election Board is dealing with griev—
anccs.

Maloney supported the changes Mirce»
tic proposed. “1 like what it did," he said. “It
makes a lot ofsense. . .reducing [Cabinet presr
encelt" He said the current system “introduces
inexperience in what pretty much is the most
important election of the year," he said, refer-
ring to cases in which the AC leaves to run for
president or VP.

While he praised the reforms for freeing
the AC to run, Maloney was vague about his
own future plans in SSA. When asked if he
planned to run for higher office, he respond-
ed “1 don't know yet. I’m keeping my options
open."

College plans another fee increase

Brand, Crady discuss rationale for increase at open forum; about 30 students attend

BY AMANDA BAYLISS

The college administration has announced that it plans to increase next
year’s comprehensive fee by 6.5 percent, raising it for the sixth year in a row.

on Monday, Nov. 22, Jonathan Brand, vice president of institutional and
budget planning and Tom Crady, vice president for student services, held an
open forum regarding a proposed 5.5 percent fee increase for the 20051006
school year. Around 30 students attended the forum, during which Brand and
Crady discussed the college's operating budget and explained the rationale for
the proposed increase.

Many students in attendance seemed skeptical of the proposed increase, and
the general mood at the forum was against an increase.

Vashti Davis ‘06, said she felt “slightly betrayed by the in-
creasc"allhough she “understood the thoughts of the admins
istration on raising tuition." Most students were favorable
towards Brand and Crady’s efforts to present (ht: proposed
budget at the forum, although Davis expressed disappoint-
ment at the student turnout considering the amount of com,
plaints across campus prior to the forum.

Yanika Schneider be expressed disappointment with
the forum later to the SUB. “When you choose to attend a
school, you don't anticipate that it is going to be increasing so
drastically every year," said Schneider.

During the forum, Brand emphasized that the operating budget for the
next fiscal year, which includes the tuition increase, still needed to be approved
by the board of tmstees, who will meet in February. The proposed budget given
to the trustees is formed by the Budget Steering Committee, which includes
Brand; Crady; 13 faculty and administrators; President Russell Osgood; and
SGA treasurer Doja Khandkar ‘05.

The trustees have approved all recent proposed tuition increases If ap-
proved, rhe budget will mark the sixth increase in six yearSAeach more than

,double the rate of inflation, Last year tuition increased by 5.25 percent, and

What' is really important to get out to the students' is that tuition is probably
going to increase and students need to start talking about this, said Khaner

in his explanation for increasing nunon, Brand cited assorted factors, in-
cluding the size ofthe financial aid pool, the achievement ofa balanced budget,
the size ofthe student body and the comprehensive fees of peer institutions.

In particular, Brand feels that “reliance on the endowment is too large,”Thus,
Brand views the tuition raise as a method ofachieving a balanced budget with
out endangering the endowment, The endowment makes up 47 percent of the
20044005 operating budget, 331.1 million.

Schneider spoke with Brand after the forum, but said she
still felt confused as to why more of the endowment could
not be allocated to the budget,

Crady and Brand also focused upon Grinnell's compre-
hensive fee in comparison to its peer institutionsThis fiscal
year Griitnell’s comprehensive fee is at as percent ofits peer
institutions, a relationship it has maintained for the past few
years.

Another important point stressed by Crady is the cole
6 r . . . .

leges commitment to keep Its admission need-blind and to

meet 100 percent of a students’ demonstrated need. Next

year's budget also includes a 53.1 million dollar increase in
financial aid. Starting with the incoming class of‘09, the college plans to use the
federal methodology system to determine students’ ﬁnancial need rather than
the institutional one it used in the past. Brand and Crady said they consider
federal methodology to be more generous to students because it reduces the
amount it expects the family to pay.

But not all studenrs felt more at ease with the proposed fee changes after the
forum. “A lot of students are on their own,” said Schneider. “You're basically tells
ing a bunch of twenty-year-olds to pull 32,000 more dollars out of their asses."
