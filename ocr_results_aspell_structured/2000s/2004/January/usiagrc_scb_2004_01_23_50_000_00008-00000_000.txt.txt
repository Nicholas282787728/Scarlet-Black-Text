2003’s 10 beSt movies

An 8&8 film reviewer separates wheat from chaff, because that‘s what they do in Iowa

by Bradley Iverson-Long

Air, 2003, the year of Sign, the movie with an absurd enough name
and plot to dethronc lI/Imras a synonym for bad. The year ofseqiicls from
every movie from last year. Thcycnt 777(L0ull7fl/15Ringsand T/ItMali’lx
trilogios finally ended, The year oriercrny Blodgeu, and the year orKay
Nguyen. In 2003, 254 movies were released, and somehow I saw 41 of
them. These 10 were the best:
1. Capturing the Friedmans

When I reviewed this him back in October, I said “capturing the
Fricdmans raises a lot ofditficult questions, and a lot oldimcult issues. To
paraphrase an old saying, truth is BETTER than ﬁction." Well, this docu»
mentary on the dissolving ofa family was better than everything else this
year, The subject matter, the investigation of hundreds ofcoiints ofsesual
abuse, \m straight out of Law and Ordtr, and the stunning voyciitistic
home videos finally validated the family camcorder DirectorAndrcw Jarccki
deftly left the Friedman’s guilt excruciatingly unresolved. This audacious
film forces the audience to reassess their opinion ofAmctica's preoccupa.
tion with publicity-hyped sex crimes.
2. Lilja 4-Ever

This story ofa lGeytntcold girl living in thc former Soviet Union is
easily the most depressing ﬁlm of the year Unnble to survive in hot pov-
erty-stricken homeland, Lilia tiagically and unwittingly enters into the
international sex ttadc. Swedish wtitcr/ditectot Lukas Moodysson. known
for his cbiillicnt comcdics (ifkuown at all), felt obligated to tell this gritty
tale to make Sweden and the “SI of thc world aware ofpliglits of millions
of children. This very political, very feminist film is immensely powerful,
itnot easy to sit through.
3. In America ,

This charming sweet but sad tale ofonc family's immigration to New
York City was the most U.s.-positive movie of the year. An Iiish family
tries to escape the loss ofn child, and is immediately swept tip in the magic
of the Big Apple. Some moments are too sweet or too stale, but many
scenes were downright enchanting All in all, it's a beautifully told story,
and it's the only movie this year that made me cry.
4. 21 Grams

I promise, this is the last sad movie on my list! All of the components
of this film; Benicio Del Toto's toughness, Sean Penn’s sadness. Naomi
Watts beautiful yet tarnished fragility, Guillermo Ariaga's philosophical
screenplay, and Alejandro Gon'uilcz Intitritu’s thoughtful direction and
editing which subverts continuity even more than Mrrnrnlo, make this a
gripping two houtexpcrience.
5. School of Rock

All hail comic and rock god Jack Black. This Black vehicle, in which

One more
top 10 list

he fiaudiilently becomes a substiiiiie teacher and turns his class into a rock
band, plays like a sultablCrforechlldten version of his band, Tenacious D.
Black, with help from some very talented kids, puts on the comedic pct»
fotmnncc ofthc year, and quite possibly his life. But at least he stuck it to
the man, with rock and roll.
6. Kill Bill, Vol. 1

This movie once again proved that sarnutai swords have their place in
cinema, which is driven into some dastardly foes midscction. Quentin
Tataiitino compressed just about every Hong Kong action movie into this
gory love letter to exploitation cinema. The blood starts dripping in the

opening scene, and ltmlcr lots up. The best part about this movie is that it's
only halfovetikillBrll, Vol 2 opens April 16‘".

7. Spellbound

sure. ninjas arc great in movies. but so are lZ»ycai‘»old kno\v»lt»alls
This documentary covering the National spelling Bee is a complete, rlvur
ing story about the American dream and guest for perfection. And it ft.
nally makes the word Daryceling drtmatic.
8. Intolerable Cruelty

These days, marriage is iiiundatcd with attacks from pop stars, cities
tirsin. reality television, and, ifyoii'll believe our ptuidciit, friendly ho»
niosexuuls. However, thc funniest attack in recent memory is in this sctcuo
ball divorce comedy that has ihe fastest jokes or the yeai. Ace attotiicy
George Clooncy and exquisite cx Catherine Zetnejunes ate iwo stat pti-te.
ﬁghters itt this romantic bmwl From the Coen Bras.
9. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King

[return oft/re King is the ﬁnal piece in one of the most impicssivc
accomplishments in cinematic history. sure, we all luiew Ftodo and the
gang would succeed, but they did so in giand, and unfortunately long,
fashion, It’s unlikely we’ll ever see another ll heiir movie about hobbits
and ores again, so be suit to relish this one.
10 (tie). X2: X-Men United and Pirates of the Carib—
bean

Hollywood actually did put out sonic good big-budget movies this
year. but I think it was rust these tivo. Both had ttleiiicd directors (Bryan
Singer nnd Goic Vetbinski) and hunky leading man (Hugh Jackman and
Johnny Depp) in rather kitschy leading roles. both films were successful
because they iiitericctcd hiimot into the action and intrigue, realizing that
pirates and duties with metal knives in their hands are rather funny.

Pain Iverson
Mother of Bradley

Iverson-Long ‘05

i need to make a big
disclaimer for my list. I
feel like I haven‘t seen the
best movie of the year, or
top two or three, and that‘s
very likely, since I haven't
seen 21 drains, Elephant,
Crplunng the fnedmans, in
America, all of Finding fierrir
or Pirates aflhe tonhbeun.
So I feel like this is the
top 342, nothing i
absolutely loved the way I
felt about Far From Heaven
and a couple of others last
year. And it could change
next week. With that, here
goes:

1. Cold Mountain

10, liubbu lip-rep

by Jeremy Blodgett

In 2003, I rediscovered a passion for film. I come
giicntly watched fcwcr films, and snvoied every aweein»
spiting and every cringe—inducing moment,

In 2003, Hollywood all but run out of aesthetic gas,
rediscovered schlock, nndstill mndc back their ilwcstmcnts,
But the industry is changing, and the intelligent filingoet
is no longer forced to look abroad for solace. And in the
middle, as always, is Mitainax and (hcertty-wood move.
ment These are all good things

In 2003, documentaries found audiences, and hence
disitibtit'ors. I, unfortunately, found fcwdoeuinentaries and
they are grossly underrepresented on my list.

chllsln in ﬁctional ﬁlms, however, had IIHIC place in
2005, Every ﬁlm on my list as l looknt them to together,
depicts a search for nltei natives to reality, A fabulous reality
ienipcted by the incredible, the mngicil, and the 21st cent
ttiry spiritual. in 2003, pcople put their faith into stories
once again.

In late 2003 and early 2004, cvei-yonc is a critic, and
everyone hns a top ten list. Do 1 have one of the top ten
best zrop ten best ﬁlm? lists. Email me for a copy.

In early 2004, 1 made this list. I wrote down each name
as it came to me. When I got done, the order looked good,
so I kept it,

1. In America

Not on: moment tings false. Writer/director Jim
Sheridan turns a camera onto his oivn coming to America
experience with the same innocence and acuity as Clitisty,
his young heroine, looks to her world through a camcorder.
A statement ofpowcrfiil optimism. told with iinpresurning

.gmce. The ﬁlm is anchored by two of the most incredible,

focused, nuanced, and mature performances of the year,

those of 12—year—old Sarah Bolgei and Seyuienld Emma
Belget.
2. Lost in Translation

A film that descends on your being and wraps around
you like a well—worn blanket. The pieces are all here. as-
rounding actors, ti solid sciipt, the visual and cultural pal-
ate otToleyo, and a kcenct sense of observation and behav—
ior than any other film this year. Less a nariativc than a
visual mood poem.

3. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of
the King

Ari iinptccedentcd phenomenon. I rind the most in-
sightful comments on Pctet Jackson's adaptation to come
from those few critics unfamiliar or unimpres d with
‘l‘olkicn‘s novels. ‘ and oiithci nofonesucheeDJV‘ld
Edclstein, critic for Slate.coiri..ivlio likens the ﬁlm to those
olKiiiatawn, one day this trilogy will be viewed with the
same wonder, excitement, and humanity as we can watch
ihescncn Slim/(mi today, cspecially by those who have never
heard ofTulltlen,

4. Kill Bill Vol. 1

what an I say, rzkin‘ irresistablc!
5. Monster

As we left, I turned to my friend and asked what, after
seeing Moder. i was supposed to leave the theater with,
what was the message? Even though I still cannot answer
the question, it stays with me, just like the him. And cv»
erywhctc I go, Aileen goes with me, and I cry for those
who run in place for a lifetime.
6. School ofRock

How does this work.> It doesn‘t hurt to have a decent
writer, an indie film god directing, andaslnpdnsh comedicn

with more genuine rock 'n roll passion than the lot 25
years combined. Now put humility on drums nnd an
iinwaivcnng him in storytelling on backing vocals. Tell
thc boiinocr to stop special effects. fancy ciiiamatoginphy,
and cgo at the door.

7. Norfhfork

sttaight outorthe dark, iinswcpt cotiiets ofthe Amelie
can dream A stark, batten, and haunting fable ofa town
being cleared to make way for a dam, The ambitious my»
thology grows out oftlie amating residents we meet along
the way in a town that modernity arrives at only to dﬂuo)‘.
Visually and conceptually breathtaking,

8. 28 Days Later

Whnt some call a zombie flick I prefer to call a low-
budget csperiiiicnt iii cinematography and narrative style,
infused with cogent social critique. Danny Boyle also made
Trainspotting which i i deadly serious, but very funny
film. 28 Days inlet is a deadly sciioiis, but thrilling nnd
scary film.

9. Whale Rider

A modern day tribal villiagc adjusts to the changes that
come about with age, youth, and lnﬂucnc: from the out.
side world. Not a visually stylistic film, but a wonderful.
enriching story. watch with your family otloved oneswhen
you‘re having a bad day. or when you just need a positive
outlook on everything.

10. Big Fish I Elf (tie)

Big Fish is about a father and the storm It: tells his
son. Elf is about a human raised as an cltwho attempts to
readjust to society, Both are well crafted, unpretentious,
magical youtncys, but an even better reason for them to
split a slot is because one day, when I have children, I‘d
love to share both ofthese films with them.
