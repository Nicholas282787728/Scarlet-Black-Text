Students will vote in SGA presidential and
vice-presidential elections next Wednesday

by Lola Garcia

The applications are in, and the candidates for next year's SGA Presie
dent and Vice President are in full campaign model

Five students are making the run for SGA President and two For Vlce
President/President ofAcadcmie Affairs. The ﬁrst round of elections will
be next Wednesday.

Current Administrative Coordinator Andy Grimm ’05 mdlolnt Board
Senator Bruce Barnum ‘05 are facing off for the position ofVice PreSlc
dent. with only two candidates, the Vice Presidential campaign should
only race one round orvoting,

The race for the President, however, will be more complicated, With
Mark Henry ’05, Matt iohnshoy ‘06, Thomas Alexander ‘05, Marko
Mitceticios and chad Marten ‘os placing their has in the ring. Johnshoy
is the Joint Board Senator for East campus, Alotander rot otteampus
housing, and Mircetic currently represents smith and Younker, Mnmn
represented smith last semester as a senator. Henry, the only candidate
not serving on Joint Board this year, is the student—at.latge representative
on the Development Committee.

According to the SGA bylaws, a candidate must gamer 50 percent or
a umpusavide vote to be elected to once. With such a large candidate
pool, the presidential election is likely to go into a run air,

But it is more than just the size that makes this year's candidate pool
interesting. last year the run for president came down to two women,
then Senator Jess Enns ‘04 and then Administrative Coordinator le Allan
‘04. Likewise, the vice presidential election pitted then Vice Prmdent Devan
McGttnahan ‘04 against studenteattlztgc Danijela Gaz'bars ‘04.The come
plete lack orwomen in this ymt's candidate pool is a significant shift.

As statements orlnrcnt began going up in bathrooms, the candidates
faced each other Tuesday in the ﬁrst oFrwo debates before the ﬁrst round
orvoting. At the debate, questions addressed issues from faculty diversity
to self-governance. one or the hottest topics or the afternoon was the
recent drug arrest and citations in Younker Hall, but questions also touched
on more basic issues ofciass size and administrative eﬁiciency.

The Tuesday debate attracted only about 25 students. Jacob Cram
‘06, the current senator sewing on the elections committee, believed the
low turnout was a result ora lack of publicity. The last debate before the
rust round orclcctions will be this Monday at 8 pm, in the North Lounge

ted three main renuns why he thought this

He says one or the main reasons hrs

Admissions also tried a more targeted campaign within
the prospect pool. “[th stopped treating all prospects the
some." said Sumner. The ofﬁce hrs worked to urge! “top
prospects" within ihe p et pool, he said,

Admissions has two criteria for determining who those
prospects will be: lrow “advantageous" a student would be
to enroll and how much interest thestudent shows in Grine
nell. we dont lgnote anybody. but we pay more attention
to top prospects, said Sumner, not all [prospects] are as
desirable, and thcyre not all interested in us '

Though the applicant numbers nte up, Sumner points
out that the number otstndcrrts in the class oizoos won‘t
besrpnrheantly higher. The office ofAdmissions is aiming
to have 400 students in the 2008 class and 10 transfer stu»
dents. The-st numbers are slightly smaller than the hunt»
