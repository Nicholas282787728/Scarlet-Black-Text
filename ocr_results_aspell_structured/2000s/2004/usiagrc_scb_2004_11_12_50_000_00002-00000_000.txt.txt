In 18 months, student investors nearly out-perform S&P 500 by emulating greats like Warren Buffett

BY DAVID ARCHER

For the past 18 months, the Student Ens
dowmenr Investment Group (SEIG), led by
Nick Hirschey ‘05, has been trying to apply
the investing methods used to create the col-
lege's billiondollar endowment to grow their
own designated portion of the endowment. So
far their efforts have yielded moderate sues
cessﬂnd roughly 314,000.

The college founded the group in 2000 to
allow students to manage a part of the endow-
ment and to respond to criticism that the colr
logc had invested too conservatively during the
tech boom, according to former SEIG leader
Sechyi Lian ‘04. Then-SGA president Sean
Flammer ‘02 persuaded the trustees to set
aside $100,000 for student management.

The group's methods depend on analysis
of companies' financial statements, especially
earnings and cashﬂow, in order to determine if
the share price is undervalued, overvalued, or
fairly valued by the stock market. For example,
if a company with solid earnings and cash
receives bad news, investors may overreact and
send the share price tumbling. Ifthe price falls
below the price warranted by the company's
balance sheet, then the SEIG would buy shares
orthe company, explained Hirschcy.

Like major brokers, the group, which
is open to all students, even tries to predict
quarterly earnings. This sort of activity
represents a major departure from the group’s
prior lenders and inembers,who did not buy or
sell much during their tenure.

”[Hirschey] knows
more about investing
than everyone else put
together,” said Sanchit
Chokhani ’05, one of a
handful of students who
attends meetings.

“We simply try to learn
as much as we can from
the brightest minds in the
business and then try
to implement their strategies its best we can,”
Hirschey said, citing warren Buffet as one of
top minds in the business. Buffet was at one
time an active member of the Griunell Cole
lege’s Board ofTrustees, though he no longer
attends meetings.

The group’s long-term goal is to outper-
form the S&P 500, a benchmark index of the
most profitable companies publicly traded on
the stock market. Since the group began in-
vesting in stocks in May 2003 the portfolio has '

grown 18.26 percent and has been out-per-
formed by the SM 500 by about 5 percent.

As of Nov. 1, the portfolio was worth
roughly $114,000. In February 2004, the
portfolio reached an all time high of $122,000,
and between May 2003 and May 2004 it
outperformed the S&P, but
has since declined.With the
extra cash, the group is con
sidering buying shares of
companies in the insurance,
pharmaceutical and
semiconductor industries.

Before Hirschey took
control of the group in
May 2003 the portfolio
was worth $96,000 and was
invested almost exclusively in short-term gov-
ernment bonds.

“I personally think the group suffered from
neglect during my time and the past," said
Secl-iyi Laiu '04, Hirschey’s predecessor. Laiu
said the group did not invest much due to the
“intense proposnlnwriting requirements" of the
SEIG guidelines.

ironically, under Laiu’s “neglect," the port-
folio weathered the collapse of the tech bubble
better than most stocks.

Eighteen months ago. the group began to
manage its money more aggressively by pur-
chasing roughly 575,000 of shares in eight
stocks. The group has since sold shares tour
times, and bought shares twice. Hirschey
says the group aims to develop a “focused
portfolio,"meauing they take a higherrrisk
approach wherein they bet on a handful
of companies instead of relying On more
conservative, diverse investments such as
Stocks, bonds, currency and property

The group currently invests exclusively .
in stocks in eight publiclystraded companies
and cash, though Hirschey said the group may
soon add bonds.

After knowing what and when to buy. the
hardest decision for an investor is to know
when to sell. After regretting not selling May-
tag shares last winter, Hirschey said the group
has since worked on formalizing their “sell cri-
teria" to minimize “the risk of holding stocks at
prices above their fair value."

In 3 Nov. 2002 article in the 5553 Laiu
said he wanted the group to “promote certain
social values,” inviting a speaker to campus on
socially conscious investing to campus. The
current group, however. does not have a policy
