Pioneers enter unbeaten in conference play

by Andrew Borneman

As rhe Gtinnell Men's tennis squad heads to Beloir for the conference
championships this weekend to play 5r. Norhen in rheir first team hour,
they can feel good ahour rhcir prospects.

“Weve put ourselves in a position where we ran be very conﬁdent. As
long as every one ofus plays hand this weekend and doesnt take the (lime
pionship for granted we should be able to win it,” said Eli Best '07.

The Pioneers missed any chance to review the depth of the St. Norbert
team this season, as their March 6 match with the Green Knights was
cancelled. But avicrory overst. Norbert would leave eirlier Ripon or lake
Forest as the only obstacle standing in rhe way ora conference victory. The
Pioneers have beaten horh teams rhis season.

Our ream is playing solid tennis and every time we step on the court
the players exhibit confidence and poise. Having played a rigorous sched»
ule will no douhr help us when we compete in the dual championship
tournament, said head coach Andy Hamilton.

The tough competition didn't stop the Pioneers From winning a schoolc
record 21 games this season and going unbeaten against conference oppoe
iicnts. Grinncll rides an eightcgame.winnlng streak into this weekend’s
action.The ream knows irwon‘t be easy, though.

“Going into the conference tournament, it is important for its to ﬁnd
a balance between conﬁdence and intensity," said Eric Ohrn ‘07. “We
have to be proud of doe way we played throughout rhe regular season
while still concentrating on what lies ahead ofus and showing up in Madic
son ready to play our best tennis ofthe year,"

The individual championship is a diliferenr story.

“A lot of the guys have great shots at winning dicir spots, but nothing
is a given. We’re a very deep train and l’ni confident about our chances at
[spots] 3-6; lint [Finiicssy ‘04] and I will have to play sonic really good
tennis to win at one and two," said Best

Players like Shiltnn Abeygiinnnordnnn ‘05 and Rick Fenberr ‘06 who
have had near ﬂawless season: could gain top seed: in their divisions.

In fact, “theie is a chance that players in all nine flights will receive a
top four seed. We have the chance to gain die top seed in seven flights.
This potcnrial of top seeds is a credit to all the hard work and strong play
put in by our individuals," said Hamilton,
