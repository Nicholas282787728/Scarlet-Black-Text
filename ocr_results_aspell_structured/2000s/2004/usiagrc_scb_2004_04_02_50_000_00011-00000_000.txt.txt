For mosrsrudeno, spring hrerir is a rime rway from theirzssoclae
tions with Grinnellr But Pioneer divers Sat-ah Stayer ‘06 and Eric
“Country” Blevins ‘04 were more involved in rheirsporr rhan ever. as

Division in Narionrl Swimming and Diving
Championships.

In her second smighr trip to Norionals.
Srryer felt more eomforrahie ar rhis year's meer
heearrse she srnrred ro develop friendships with
many of her rornming competitors. Her con»
ﬁdenee was also increased by the fact that she
had dove at the pool where the meet was held
while she was in high school.

Srayersrarred orrsrrongiy on lm, but near
rhe end or rhe evenr, having aeeidonraiiy writ-
ren down a dive she was performing on 5 m on
rhe iodge's sheer, she performed rhe wrong dive
and received a seore ofall zeroes. This dropped her from I th plnoe
to I9rh pleee en Im.

Neverrheiess. Stayer rehounded rhe following day, heginning rhe
3m eomperirion with rwo well-executed dives.

"I looked up an rhe scoreboard and saw my name in lst place
after the second round,“ said Stayer of her ﬁrst event, the l in board.
"I was thrilled because I had just nailed one of the hardm dives that
I had heen having rrouhle vvirh in rhe pasr."

Srayer ended up plaeing iorh on 3m, earning Honorable Mcne
rion All-America srrrns and a 59rh pleee national ranking for rhe
women‘s swimming and diving team.

"It wont my hnesr meer, but I was happy with my diving per»
formance," said Srayer. Nari year, if I can dive rhar well and write
down everyrhing eorreedy I'll be m prorry good shape."

The 20054004 eampeign marked rhe ﬁrst rime |n roaeh Erin

“They really couldn’t
believe it. They said they
knew I would perform
well, but I deﬁnitely took
them by surprise."
