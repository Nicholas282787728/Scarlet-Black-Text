tions for vice president due next Friday

3v DAVlD MDNTGOMERV

Following fall break, SGA is hold—
ing elections for Vice President. cur-
rent VicerPresident Andy Grimm ‘05
has decided to take a medical leave of
absence from Grinnell, and is resigning
his position in SGA effective Friday,
Oct. St The eleCr
tion will work like
normal SGA cabir
net elections, with
a candidate debate
before the voting.

Prospective vice
presidents have un-
til Friday, Oct. is
to submit an ap-
plication. The ups
plicatiou includes
basic information, a
statement of intent
and a "publicity statement," siad Mike
Maloney ‘06, SGA administrative Co
ordinator.

A debate will be held on Tuesday,
oct. 26, in the Forum North Lounge.
The election will open on Pioneer-
wcb at midnight and run for 24 hours.

ing out how to work

will change

SGA president

period on Thursday, during which time
Maloney says any complaints about (hc
election may be submitted.

The SGA constitution requires that
one candidate receive “50 percent, plus
one," of the vote, said Maloney. That
means that ifmore than two candidates
run and no one receives
a majority, a run~off
election will be held,
possibly as early as Fri-
day, Oct. 29.

Until the election,
Rebecca Miller ‘05, the
Student Services Co-
ordinator, will serve as
iritetim vice president.

Current President
Marl; Henry '05 said
that he and Grimm
spent at least seven
hours per day working together. ““The
idea is that the VP and president spend
almost all ofrhcir time together work-
ing on rhings,"he said.

Grimm and Henry ran together for
SGA Cabinet and had a very close rela-
tionslrip. Henry admitted that adapting
to the change in Vice President would

be difﬁculti “We spent a lot ofrimc this
semester ﬁguring out how to work too
gether as a cabinet,” he said. "This will
change that dynamic a lot." Henry said
that he hopes the new Vice President
will have a strong SGA background.

According to the SGA constitution
“A permanent vacancy in the ofﬁce of
the Vice-President... shall be ﬁlled by
special clcctron,"providing it occrrrs be-
fore thc'nert year's cabinet elections.

Atjornt Board on Tuesday, senators
and cabinet discussed the meaning of
special election. “The way they put it
to us was that this was a constitutional
issue, and that Cabinet needed help in-
terpreting the constitution," said Ellen
Sattorrvlrite ‘05, a senator from Loose
Head. “There's no precedent.“

After discussing having an applica-
tion process in which cabinet would
select a candidate who would then
need to be approved by tworthirds of
Joint Board and the student body,]oint
Board instead made a near-unanimous
“strawqaoll” decision to elect the VP
through a campusrwide election, said
Sattcrwhrte.

Coke machines
overturned

BY CID STANDIFER

Between 3 and 6 arm. on Saturday, some students on South came
pus heard a loud crash. It was later found that two Coke vending
machines in the loggra had been tipped over. Steve Brrscoe, director
ot‘Security, said that there were also ﬁreworks going offin the area.

it is unclear whether or not the machines were tipped as an act
of civil disobedience, but some students reported that when they
passed by the machine around 7 or 8 am, they saw a guest column
from last weeks Sﬁs’B entitled “send coke Off campus” lying on
the machine. However, Briscoc said that when he ﬁrst found the
tipped machines, the article was not there.

The letter was written by Molly Offerchstort and Zeke HauSr
father as representatives ofa committee formed by the Latin Amerir
can Solidarity Group and Students Against Sweatshops to start a
boycott ofCoca-Cola products because of their alleged internation-
al human rights abuses The committee's goal is for the college not
to renew its exclusive contract with the company in 2008.

According to john Kalkbrenner‘, dean of student services, the
college will not have to pay for the machines. Since the vending
machines an: owned by the Coke Borders of the Midwest, the price
of repairing or tcplaciug them, which may run as high as several
thousand dollars, will fall to the company. However, Bi-iscoe said
that “The chances of the college putting another machine in [that
location near Loose] are very slim."

Thc anti-Coke committee unanimously denies any involvement
in the act. “I feel it's pretty obvious we had nothing to do with it,”
said Hausfather, Some of
the members of the group
are concerned that the act
of vandalism will alienate.
some Grinnellians from
their cause, but they to},
lectively decided that it
was unnecccssaty to take
a strong stand on the van
dalism because it would
dcrracr their focus from
the continuing campaign
to end Grinnell's contract
with Coke.

Hausfather expressed his personal opinion that, “in some ways,
by knocking down the coke machine, it's working through force
instead of choice. [I] want to promote student choice." Hausfather
said he would rather see other soft drinks available as options rather
than to entirely remove Coke from campus.

At this point the vandalism does not appear to have damaged
the image of the anti-Coke movement on campus, According to
Hausfathcr, the committee got a few hundred people to sign their
petition to boycott Coke on Tuesday, the first day of their campaign,
and they intend to keep collecting signatures.

Kalkbrenner does not see the act as a valid form of protest.
“Without an individual coming forward and taking responsibility
for the act. it is only a cowardly act of vandalism, not civil disobedir
eucc,” he said. Kalkbrenner thinks that a boycott against the com
pany is perfectly respectable, but destruction of property is not an
acceptable method ofchanging the college's policy.

Briscoe believes that the act was simply foolish and unsafe. "If
someone would have been under there, it could have killed them,"
he said “Somebody could have been paralyzed for life or killed. It
wasn‘t a smart thing to do." He claims that the perpetrator, it‘ caught,
could be expelled and may face a prison sentence

However, student Cassandra Donnelly ‘06 thinks the act dtk
serves the Grinncll community’s full support. She believes that “the
act of tipping over a Coke machine is more otan act ofselfrgoverr
nancc than doing nothing," and thinks it's a reasonably strong way
ofshowing the college administration that the student community
is angry about the college’s contract.

The college security department has no suspects at the moment,
and the company will decide whether or not to press charges lfalr
leged perpetrators are found,

“Without an individual
coming forward and tak»
ing responsibility for the
act, it is only a cowardly
act of vandalism, not
civil disobedience."
