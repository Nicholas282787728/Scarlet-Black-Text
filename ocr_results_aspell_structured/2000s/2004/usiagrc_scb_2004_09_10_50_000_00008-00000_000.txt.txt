the scarlet and black

combat duty, not
Guard service, was
real deal in Vietnam

For more than six months now
the military service, or lack thereof, of
our presidential candidates has been
widely discussed, especially over this
past month. As someone who carrre
of age during the Vietnam War and
faced the military draft in the same
way as John Kerry and George Bush,
let me see ifI can shed a bit of light
on the subject.

As you may know during the first
several years of the war, conscrip-
tion was the law ofthe land and most
males in their late teens and early
twenties faced the same options: seek
an education or family deferment
(increasingly difﬁcult to obtain as the
war wore on), make your case as a
conscientious objector (and serve two
years of alternative service in a non~
war related manner), seek refuge in a
sympathetic country outside the US.
(C.g., Canada, Sweden, etc), submit
to the draft (two years or military
service and running the risk of come
bat in Vietnam), enlist in the military
(thereby requiring longer aetrve duty
service and giving you
some say as to what
you might do during
your service), or join
the military reserve or
national guard (same
programs. one feders
ally controlled and
one state controlled).

For example, Bill Clinton and
Dick Cheney chose to take advan-
tage otrlreir deferment options, john
Kerry and Al Gore volunteered for
service in Vietnam. Kerry as a Nae
val ofﬁccr and Corc as a draftcd ens
listed (noneoffrccr) pcrson, antl Dari
Qrayle and George Bush enlisted rn

the national guard, a route vrrtually

So, who served in the
guard? Largely well-ed-
ucated, white, middle
and uppersclass kidsr To

identical to the one I chose.

One of the many tragedies of the
Vietnam War was the vast inequity
by which the draft was applied and
how one escaped the draft itoue was
so inclined; if your eonscrcncc was
insufficiently developed, your college
deferments expired, your fear ofbattle
and your desire to stay home great,
and your need to protect your em—
ployment and political future great,
the national guard became the most
appealing option,

However, in or
tier to gain admise
sion to the guard one
needed to be well in—
formed, understand
the system, and, if
necessary, seck ras
votitism,

So. who served
in the glmld? Largely well-educated,
white, middle and upper-middle class
kids. Arid who served in Vietnam?
Largely lower-income, less well edur
cared persons otcolor.

This is part orwhat makes Ker-
ry's story so compelling. While Gore,
whose service is also atlmirablc,scr\'cd
as a journalist in Vietnam, Kerry hie-ed
combat, won the Silver and Bronze
Stars (the second and third hrglr
est honors for war
bravery in the us.)
and was wounded
thtcc timcs (earns
lug rhrce purple
hearts).
show you

how National

Guard admission
worked, think about one or my col-
lege classmates wlro began our ﬁrst
year after graduarion as a mcmbcr or
the Dallas Cowboys football team,

When team management learned
that he was racing the dratt, they
scoured the county for Cowboy fans
who corrld help him gain admission to
the guard.

Kerry and Gore could
have done the same
thing, pulling the same
kind of strings...but
clearly chose not to.

A spot turned up in Alabama, the
team flew him there and back to be
sworn in, and he completed the roots
ball season, He then served his six
months of active duty in the offsseae
son and returned for five more unilr
terrupted seasons ofNFL football

Kerry and Gore could have done
the same thing, pulling the sarrre kind
of strings if necessary, but clearly
chose not to.

It should also be remembered that
grrard and reserve
duty in the 1960s
and 1970s virtually
guaranteed limited
(six months. maybe
less) stateside active
duty, unlike totlay
when something on
the order or 30 per-
ccnt of Iowa guard
mcnibcrs have bccn called to active
duty, many for combat in Iraq,

Lastly, let me brieﬂy describe the
dayl completed my ten bees oi‘bas
sic training at Fort Banning, Georgia,
the largest military base in the world
in 1968.

As we graduated on a Saturday aft
ternoon, nearly all ofthe draftccs with
whom we had trained were immedi-
.ltcly put on Army buses {or travel
all night to Fort Polk, La, to begin
their jungle warfare trainingThis was
the sure ticket to Vietnam for these
mostly At‘ricansAmerrcan, less edus
catcd southerners.

The rest or lls, mostly white, edu-
cated reservists and guardsmen, had a
few (lays off bclotc we began another-
terrweek round of safe, stateside
tralnlllg.Tllcn we went home.

Stateside tliity in the guard dur
lag the Vietnam era was not serious
military service and should never be
represented as such. combat duty in
Vietnam was the real thing.

Grinnell school
board: a fair and
balanced view

Whether we students recognize it or not, our community ex-
tends beyoad our campus borders.The town orGrinnell provides us
with valuable services and a number of uscful businesses. Since we
spend (our years utilizing its perks,wc, at a minimum, should invest
some of our time and energy in making the community a better
place, A great opportunity presents itself on Tuesday, September 14
when local school board electrons are held,

The electron has one hotly contested race, pitting the incumbent
Vicki DeAngelo against challenger Brent HendricksThough we are
pleased with the unusual amount of attention the race has received
on campus, we express regret that it stems from raise rumors about
Hendricks’ ideology some on campus have sensationalized the race,
contending that Hendricks is a raging Christian fundamentalist
bent on taking evolution out of schools. However, Hendricks has
personally refuted this myth to the 5&3, noting that altering cure
riculums mentioning evolution is “not even on the radar" and that
parents should not “expect the school to be their church.”

Like DeAugelo, Hendricks is an upstanding citizen who should
be accordcd proper courtesy and respect. Participating in a mass hys-
teria against him, that is notably unfounded in evidence, betrays the
value oropensmindodness and the spirit ofintcllcctual inquiry that
Grrancllnns pl‘ e themselves on,

Nonetheles ust because Hendricks is not an unabashed [lghf’
wing Christian ideologue does not mean students should vote {or
lrrrn. At a recent League otwomcn’s voter forum, hrs openmg and
closing statements were filled with vague declarations, while his
responses to questions were almost always evasive. In sum, he has
failed to state a coherent and specific case tor unseating a popular
and cftcctivc incumbent

DeAngelo has served the school district wcll in her two tcrlns by
leadrng the fight for necessary building projects and introducing ails
day, everyday kindergarten. The winner of the 1998 governor's vols
rrnteer award, DcAngelo has eonsistently displayed a deep concern
for the well-being ofthe community.This concern coupled With her
open opposition to harmful legislation such as the No Child Left
Behind Act, puts her ideologically in step with the vast majority of
thc Grinncll College community.

It was quite shameful when only 11 Gtinncll snldcnts voted on a
comprehensrve bond issue last year. Beyond giving back to the toms
munity, it rs in our own selferntcrest to vote in school board cm,
trons. Ai'ter all, ptofessols and admrnrstrators have only one choice
of where to send their kids to school. Ifwe allow the Grinnell school
district to decay, we will attract rewer otthe best and brightest to fill
these essential roles.

since only about 10-15 percent (or roughly 1200 people) ofregr
istcrcd voters are expected to arm out for the elections, Grinncllians
havc tremendous power to alter the racc's outcomer With polls open
from noon to 8:00 pm , thcrt is no reason why you should rrot capi-
talize on this unique opportunity.
