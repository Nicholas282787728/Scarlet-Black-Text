Aping around

“In ten years the population ofwild great apes will be extinct,"

said Duane Rumbaugh as he began last Friday's lecture.
Rumbaugh cited Kirk Brocker, director of
the Great Ape Trust Research Center open—
ing outside of Des Moines. speaking to a
full audience in die roinm soudi Lounge,
Rumbaugh spoke to students about the im
portance of saving and studying great apes,
humansY closest relatives, whose nntuml
habitat is rapidly disappearing.

Rumbaugh, who has studied great apes
for over 45 years, explained to the audience
the importance not just of saving the great
apes, but also their intelligence. While flip-
ping through slides of the apes and their ac»
comphshments, Rumbaugh shared anecdotes
in which apes were able to understand human language and actions
and solve complex problems.

The Great Ape Trust functions as both a sanctuary and a re-
search center. It is one of the largest facilities in North America

the scarlet and black

for studying the animals. Wlule still partially under construction,
the Trust hopes to be one of the ﬁrst sanctuaries in the world to
include all tour types ofapcs: bonobos, gar
nllas, chimpanzees and onrngutans. The
Trust already houses a number of omng~
limits and should be home to a group or

bonobos in 2005.

At Grinnell College, starting a club is
just a matter of filing some paperwork with
SGA. When students attempted to start
a renting club here this semester, hth
ever, they learned that it could be
another matter entirely to keep it
going. While Fencing Club began
with high hopes, it's now become
defunct until next semester, when
its organizers hope to become
more active.

The goal of Fencing Club was
(0 provide a forum where students
could get together and fence twice
a week. The key obstacle is equip-
ment. According to Mark Nettling ‘07,
the coordinator of Fencing Club, “the bare
minimum for fencing is a foil and a face
mask.” Getting enough equipment to allow
everyone interested to participate would
prove a difﬁcult task,

some equipment was already available
on campus. Stored in the PEC was a mis-

matched assortment of equipment, including
11 full jackets, seven vests, two leftthandcd
gloves, one rightehanded glove, rive rnasks, 11
foils,26 underarm protectors, and one female
breast protector. Some ofthis was in less than

optimal condition. With the four students
who already had their own gear, this meant
that there enough gear for nine students to
fence at a timeifour simultaneous bouts.
Interest in fencing seemed high at ﬁrst.
According to Nettling, 40 people showed up
to the informational meeting, and 32 came
to the first practice. With these numbers in

mind, Netrling and the covcoordinator, Matt
Scharr ‘08, requested approximately $4,500
from SGA. That would, with uscablc old
equipment and personal gear. provide enough
for 30 people.

“I didn’t really expect to get all orir,"Nere
tling said. “i was hoping for around 52,000."
A foil, mask, jacket, and glove cost approxi-
mately $150.

The SGA gave 8900 to the fencing club.
Thcirjustification for this lower amount was
that Grinnell clubs often have high atten-
dance when first started, hut this often drops

off considerably.

“It was sort of a catchtZZ,” said Scharr.
“SGA won’t give us money unless there's in—
terest, but there won’t be interest unless we

next semester because many peo-
ple in the club felt it wasn't worth
it with low levels of activity.

“It's all well and good to work
on footwork and stuff," said meme
ber Heather Whisenhunt ‘08.
“But when you can’t actually do
anything but learn theory, practices
can get kind ofrcstricted."

Next semester, Nettling is hopeful that
the group will be able to get more money
for equipment. He’s also made plans for ac-
tivities to keep people involved even if there
isn’t enough gear to go around. Nettling and
Scharr are also considering raising money
for equipment, such as a movie night with a
swashbuckling movie like 2am.
