Obviously. we re all busy. We have far too much
to do and far too little time in which to do it. And
so in order to save tiliie, we tend to neglect the little
perks of lifcislecping relating, hygiene and

times only 15 minutes to eat before

your next meeting. If you even make

it to the dining hall, it's hard to stay

for any length oftime before hurrying

offto complete youi next task. We sit

down, eat as fast as we can and get out.

But this hustle and bustle attitude s
towards eating could cause even
more stress than we already have.
In addition to putting us at risk
for acid reﬂux, possible weight
gain, choking and other physical problem, it’s just
not as tun, and it makes you feel yucky. We all have
to eat, so I say we all just relax alid take a few ext
tra seconds to think about and appreciate what it is
that we're're eating. “But how?" one may ask, My
answer: Mindfulness.

First off, what is mindfulness? It sounds weird
and new agey, I know. Truth be told, it sort ofis.You
see, it’s a technique, used by therapists and crystal
toting hippies alike, meant to reduce the harmful

effects stress can have on our minds and bodies.
According to the Woinens Heal-t Founditlon,
“Mindfulness Meditation has been shown tollielp
a person manage stressful situations by increasing
one's awareness and by making the mind more
receptive one’s ellirelit situa-
tion and internal states. It is
a method or fully embracing
with minimal resistance one’s
current life situation and in-

ternal states."
sounds pretty good,
huh? But what, you
may be asking,
does this have to
do with eating.>
Applying the basic
principals ofmindfulliess can help
one to enjoy the act of eating and
relieve stress from the day rather than accumulate
more. Here are some suggestions to increase your
awareness of eating:

)1Make active choices iii your eating rather than

oranges

just stepping down whatever is there. Think about

what you really would like to eat, Look at the food
you are about to eat. Notice the way it’s arranged on

the plate, how it looks, what colois are preselit,what

textures you see

2)While eating, take the time to note the taste
aiid texture of each bite you take. Notice how the
tood reels as you chew and swallow it, Try to follow
the path orthe food and it makes its way down your
throat into yoili stomach.

3) SLOW DOW'N. Many of
us eat at quite an accelerated pace.
If you find yourself ﬁnished eat-
ing before anyone else at your ta-
ble, tiy taking at least ten bites of
your food bcrcrc swallowing. It‘s
better for digestion and you’ll be
surprised at how few bites you're
accustomed to taking.

4) Eating alonc> Try to ﬁnish
your meal without reading. See
what it’s like when you actually
pay attention to the food you're
eating. When your mind wanders, try to bring it
back to the experience orcating.

The bottom line isienjoy yourself. No, you
shouldn't neglect your friends or conversation in
order to concentrate on your Beef Ole’, but try to
treat eating as a pleasant experience rather than an
annoying chore. This will help make your meals a
more relaxing, happy and tasty experience,
