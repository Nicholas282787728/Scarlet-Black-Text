Women's basketball is back on the road again
this weekend tor Just another road trip—with one
tiny difference. it's the playotfs, and its the first
time the Pioneers have been there in over a decade.
Not that that ehanges things roo mueh.

“Our approach thisweek will not be mud-i dif-
forent then how we usuelly prepare for o nvongame
road trip," said head coach Andy Hamilton. “We
always focus on the first opponent when we play
conference doubleheaders. i never prepare our team
during the week of praetioe for the second term. t
peisonaliy prepare tor that team
and dim share itwidi our squad
the morning ofrhe mme.“

“We lost to Ripon at home, not playing our

Th turnaround

crinnell women's boskotball's trip to the
postseason taps one of the more remarkable
turnarounds ever seen at Grinilell. Griililell's two
seniorsiiai Duncan no and Acrivi Coromslos '04—
saw the team win three games in their ﬁrst two
years, and the Pioneers hnisned a game under .500
last year.

“The most rewarding aspect or going to this
yeors playotfs is knowing how much the team has
improved these past two years,” said Coromelas,
”We've gone from 0-20 to 15-7 with a real shot at
winning the coniereiite championship. Such a quick
turnaround is amazing. When 1 ﬁrst trensiared here,
we could hardly get 50 people in the stands. This
season, tons at people would show up, with the
crowd intreosrng every game. It's rewarding to see
the Grinnell community recognize the team's
success and improvement.”

What the ions noticed relatively recently the

players felt was possible a longtime ago.

“1 always knew that Grinnell had talented
basketball players, and it was just a matter oi
bringing all the skill and desire together with some
consistency," said Duncan, the team's leading
scorerdt12.5 points per game.

”Only the team expected to get this far,” said
cornmelas. ”Opponents lntitially underestimated us
and we surprised them,"

Though the playoffs Seemed like a considerable
long shot two years ago, the Pioneers don’t plan on
resting on their newfuund laurels, .

”I'm not sure that when 1 came to Grinilelll
thought we’d be going to the Conference Tourney,"
said Duncan, ”but rrom the end of last season, mu
team had one goal—to be in the top fouriand we
did it. but as far as we're concerned, just getting to
the tournament isn't enough—we want to win it."
