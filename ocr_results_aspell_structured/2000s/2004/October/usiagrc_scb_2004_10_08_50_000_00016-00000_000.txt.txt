tennis player, joins the Pioneer women’s team

BY MAMATA PoKHAREL

This year, Grinncll women’s tennis
has yet another international star in
its ranks. The newest addition, Camila
Alarcon ‘08 from Guatemala, is already
making waves.

“She lights a fire under people,"said
coach Barb Waite. “She is very com—
petitive and pushes everybody to play
harder,"

Alarcon is already playing No.1
doubles with Jill Harms ‘05, and No, 2
singles. She has also played No.1 singles
the past two weekends, wmning both
her No.1 matches
the first weekend and
winning one of the
two on her second.

competition,” said Waite.

For Alarcon tennis was a fam-
ily thing. Her great grandfnthcr played

“le mom loves the game and my
dad loves the competition," she said.
“They always check the website for
how we are doing."

At age ﬁve, Alarcon started playing
tennis and at eight, she came in third

she started taking tennis seriously. “No
one in my family had been competitive

She tookformal training and played
with boys to improve her skills. “They
didn’t like it when i beat them, but it
certainly made me very competitive,"
she said. smiling.

Alarcon got recruited with Guates
mala’s national team at 14 and played
international tournaments, finishing
third in the Central American Tourna-
ment and fifth in the ITF pre-vvotld
tournament.

“Playing international tournaments
during my junior and senior years of
high school was tough," Alarcon said,

Alarcon put academics before ten-

really wanted a college where the level
of tennis would be appropriate," she
said. “Grinncll is the toughest team in
the conference right now."

“Tennis is secondary in these stun

“Though it must be chance that we are
getting the really good players, I like to
think that such good years will contin-

“That balance is tough for an ins

has decided that competition within

individual matches pla)ed this season.
“The top eight players are really solid,"
Alarcon said of her team “I haven't

Alarcon also loves her coach. “It is
so inspiring to have a woman coach.
You can identify with her." she said.
“She puts our needs before everything
else, she’s like a mother figure."

The only misgiving Alarcon has
about tennis at Grinncll is that there
isn’t enough of it. “I played all year

said.“The season hetc is too short."

However, the teammates have al-
