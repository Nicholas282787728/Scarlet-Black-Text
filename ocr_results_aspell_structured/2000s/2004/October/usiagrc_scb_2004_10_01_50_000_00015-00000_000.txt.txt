in defeat at
ITA Regionals

Women’s team impresses in indi-
vidual matches at Luther College

3v EMANUEL ANDRAS

The competition at last weekend‘s ITA Regionals
was tough but “the players did very well considering
the difficult draw," says head coach Barbara Waite. At
Luther College, where the tournament was held, the
women’s tennis team posted its first major loss of the
season.

All four ofthe women's singles players raced seeded
players in the first round, highlighting the intense levr
el ofplay. But still, individual players such as ﬁrstryear
Camila Alarcon ‘08 performed well. She admnced to
the third round ot’singles championship play, defeats
ing No. 9 seed Amy Willhite of St. Catherine 7s,
one along the way, and Karly Olson ofWheaton s-
4, 3—5, 10-5, before finally losing to Alex lackson of
Carthage in the third round 476,6t1,1078.

Shweta Khajur‘ra ‘07 also had a good outing. She
advanced to the ﬁnals ofthe consolation tournament,
playing three singles matches' in a day and heating a
top ranked player from UW Whitewater en route to
the final. She withdrew from the final, though due to
injuries sustained during the tournament.

In doubles play, sisters sid and Shwctrl Khajuria
defeated Michelle Baur andjamic Simon ofUVl/rOsr
hkoslr 8A1 to advance to the second round before falls
ing to a team from Carleton.The remaining doubles
teams ofjill Harms (’05) and, Alarcon, and Engh and
Jocelyn Newhouse (‘08), were eliminated in the ﬁrst
round.

Though they did not fare well here, Sid Khajuria
‘05 says the team displayed “amazing ﬁghting spirit
and did not give up until the end. No one was in-
timidated by the number orplayers in the draw or the
competition level."

Waite added that this loss was a learning experi—
ence and a chance to observe the best regional players
in action.

“Next year," she said, “We will participate with
that much more conﬁdence."

At Augustana’s ansrnan/Lundeen Invite on Sept.

CROSS COUNTRY ﬁnished 8th of 30 teams,

while MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY ﬁnished 4rd of

JUSTIN RILEY ‘06, COLIN TSCHIDA '05, MITCH
HERZ ’05, OMONDI KASIDHI '05, VALENTIN
JIMENEZ ’08 and ADAM SEALS ’06 all recorded
ﬁnishes that put them in the Pioneer All Time
Top 50 for individual times. On the women's side,
the top six ﬁnishes were recorded by ﬁrst years or
sophomores. PIONEER FOOTBALL has gained
over 850 yards in its two road games, but has
lost them both by double digits. Grinnell put up
530 yards of offense at Illinois College last week.
but committed two turnovers to It’s none. The
Blueboys also had 481 yards of their own, and
Pete Jennings’s 24-yard touchdown strike to U.

a 30-12 lead en route to 3 37‘25 victory. A
week after his record-setting performance against
Macalester, running back NATE WINEINGER ‘05
ran for 191 yards and scored three secondshalf
touchdowns in Grinnell's defeat. . wJoe Genl'

sweep

Lake Forest men’s and women’s soccer teams defeat their Grinnell counterparts in
nailbiting fashion; Lawrence, St. Norbert on deck for both Grinnell soccer teams

3v JUSTIN WALLACE

Two teams play each other twice In those two games, one team
takes 53 total shots, the other 13. Think you can guess who won?
Probably not, as the Grinnell women’s soccer team (so, 24) again
came up empty—handed last weekend at home against Lake For-
est in a 2-1 heartbreaker which took two overtimes to decide. The
game was part ofa doubleheader sweep by_ the visiting Foresters, as
the Lake Forest mens team also triumphed over Grinnell

Thc womcns team outshot the Foresters 28- 9 last Saturday; it
ms a 2574 shot differential that resulted in a 170 Forester win in last
year’s conference tournament, the last time the teams played.

’08. “It was obvious that we were working out
there”

Kate Diedrick '07 began the scoring early on
with a goal assisted by both Rachel and Kara M05,
kowitz ’06 at 11:42. It was nearly 64 minutes be-
fore Lake Forest's Melissa Stevenson knotted the
match for Lake Forest. The teams were still tied
at the end of the 90-minute regulation period and
through the ﬁrst 15 minutes of overtime before
ForesterjuniorTnnya Lopez curled a shot into the
upper right-hand corner at 117250 to close out the
persistent Pioneers, who had watched several shots of their own
come agonizingly close to ending it in the first OT session.

“One ofthe frustrating aspects of soccer is that it is one of the
few games that you can completely dominate possession and still
not score more points,"said Coach Heather Benning,"unfortunuter
1y for us this Saturday we hit the crossbar and post and then just
missed the tar netting on a great opportunity."

The Pioneer women look to secure a spot in the foutrteam con,
ference tournament when St. Norbert and Lawrence come to town
this weekend. Thc matches begin at 11 am. on both Saturday and
Sunday

“This week we need to refocus our mental game and get pre'
pared for St. Norbert and Lawrence,” Beniiing said. “Lawrence’s
record is misleading as they are playing quality opponents and they
too outshot Lake Forest."

there."

The Pioneer men's soccer team will also host the Green Knights
and the Vikings this weekend as they look to rebound from a 4-2
loss to the Foresters which was a closer match than the score im-

lies.
p Lake Forest struck ﬁrst early on when Tino Casttejon ﬁnished
a rebound in the fifth minute. Before the end of the half however,
the Pioneers capitalized on a deﬂection off a Lake Forest defender
to even the match at 1»1. The score remained tied until the 67th
minute when Foresterjunior Sam Figeroa blasted a slow-rolling re-
bound into the lower right corner to put Lake Forest ahead 2 1.

With less than five minutes remaining, Demitrio Rojas! '02 re
ceived a Joe Hansen 05 through- -ball on the right
ﬂank and curled a difficult shot around Forester
goalkeeper Pat Wirwicki to score what appeared
to be an overtime—forcing second goal tor the Pier
neers.

An overtime session would not be needed to
decide this year’s encounter, however, as Lake Fore
est added goals bywalter Echevcrry and Ben Lew
in the final 3:50 to prevail 472.

“I was impressed that we could come back to
tie them, to make it2- 2," junior defenderKip Kel-
ley said, but the fact that we let them more two
goals in the last few minutes shows tha‘“a ‘ need
to do more work.“

Regardless ofthe scoreboard ﬁrst year coach Brian Ja
lieves that his team finds other ways to win.

“Anybody that sees our team play, I think would be proud that
we are a classy group of competitors who play exceptionally hard
and for one another."

The 3-4 Pioneers face a difficult duo oropponents in St. Nor-
bert and Lawrence this Saturday and Sunday. The Green Knights
are 870 overall and 270 in conference play and look to compete at
the national level after defeating 2003 Final Four qualiﬁer U‘Wr
Oshkosh. Lawrence sits a deceiving 2-4-2 having taken four teams
to overtime without garnering a victory (07272). Both games will be
played at 1:30 pm. at Grinnell’s Varsity Performance Complex.

“We haven't talked speciﬁcally about [St Norbert and Lawrence]
yet,” Kelley added, “but we've put the Lake Forest loss behind us."
