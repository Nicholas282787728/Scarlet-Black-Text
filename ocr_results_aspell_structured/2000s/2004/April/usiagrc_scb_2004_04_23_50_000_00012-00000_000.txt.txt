The smoking ban
is the latest mani-
festation of Grin-
nell College’s
continual preoccu-
pation with its
public image

Smoking: load,
ban: bad

I’d like ro say rbree dungs abour rbe smoking ban:

l. ceryour beads out oFthe sand, lrs happening. Possibly, rbougli
nor probably. this rail.

2. unlike lasr week’s oped conrribiiror on rbe subyecr, Lukas
viba ‘05, I absolurely abbor all rliiiigs robacco. I regard smoking as
ﬁoul and rlagraiir, and ir direcrly violares my sensibilmes vvlrerever ir
errsrs, unlike a can oreoke, a Big Mac, oreven rlre muddiesr oﬁmurrs,
to use some oerba's examples. I would like norbing berrer rlian ro
bave more lounges, more public spaces, and more dorms be declared
oﬁrlimie from ir.

3. Despire our radically dirrcrenr views on smoldng, I agree wirli
Vrba on this: I’m againsr a campus—wide ban.

Why? Simply pur, because i don'r wanr people no smoke wberel
am, bur rbey sbould be able ro smoke somewhere. And rbey will, As
long as a bandﬁil ofdotms or lounges are open ro rliem, people will
smoke rbere and nor wliere I’m ar. But on a smokerree campus.
rliose wbo liglir up will be equally illieir wberever drey go. so what's
ro srop rlrenr rrom coming onro my Floor? l can'r imagine rliey're all
just going ro kick rbe babir in rriisuairion once a ban is implemenred.

Jiisr bow many people are we ralking abour bere.> According ro

Horowitz does

By rbis pomr, I'm sure rlrar everybody on mmpus krroivs orlasr

roiiser David Horowiu, l don'r bave ro rell you rliar bis ralk was
generally ilkreeeived and rliar "conservatism" ewbarever ir means e
enjoys, iranyrbing, aworse repurarion now rlian ir did before.

I, ror one, was liugely disappoinred by Horowiu. i say rlris as
someone wlro sympadrizo ouire srronglywirb bis alleged goal _ open.
iug college campuses ro grcarer diversiry or rbougbr. a diversiry rbar
includes ﬁgures and positions idenriﬁed, rigbrly orwrongly, as con

wlreii ir became clear rliar be was more inreresred in provoking bis

Tbar Horowio's visir would rranspire as ir did is sad e nor leasr
