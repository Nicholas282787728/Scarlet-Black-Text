the cage

The key to the PEC is the cage. Behind its glass
sliding door lies everything you need for your PEC
workout, besides your gym shoes and a few Jules
of energy from your sleep-deprived body

Members of the Grinnell community can check
out all the equipment necessary to play ten»
nis, racquetball, volleyball, soccer and baseball.
Beyond ball spurts, they can also check out
climbing shoes, workout videos and towels, which
they'll even wash for you. In addition, they can
borrow locks for the locker room for 2 $5 collate
eral charge.
