restore a “campus voice," maintain self—governance,
bring back school pride and increase campus safety

by Ben Weyl

Marir Henry ‘05 played on a bowling
ream until he was 13 years old and onee
earned a high score onlOr To this day,
he has not been able to break the record
that he set so long ago. But that is not why
there is a proﬁle about him. This proﬁle is
about Henry because he will be the next
president ofSGA.

Henry formerly
worked on the De
velopment Commit»
tee with the Board of
Trustees. He decided
to run fol-SGA presi-
dent because “the ex-
periences I've had
here over the last two
years have made me
realize that I do
knawa lot about the
college but i wasn't taking on as much
of an active role as I wanted.”

Henry sees his biggest task as “restor.
ing our campus voice." “We’re in a Posi»
rion right now ro get our voices heard,
bur it's going to take a lot orerrorr on the
part ofSGA and the students,” he said.
“Self-governance is being tesred right
now. Nexryear is going to be interesting.
We are gorng to have two remaining
RLCs, so it's going to be on the srudenrs
and the SAs to keep self—governance as it
should he. I think we need to revisit what
Sclfrgovernanm: means and what it allows

”We’re in a position right
now to get our voices
heard, but it’s going to take
a lot of effort on the part
of SGA and the students."

us to do."

Henry also believes in the importance
ofschool pride. “I intend to bring hack
some pride in the college, nor in that
cheesy way, bur in bringing back tradi-
tions and more all-campus events. There
is so much that students have at their ﬁns
gettips but thcylte Just not always aware

orhow to get or. I’m
going to do my best
to make sure people
know how to nayi.
gate the scnrtd tape
tnd get the most they
can out ofGrinnell."

Henry's toado list is

students to walk. “I think it's a great place
to start," Henry said. "There's a clear re-
quest for greater seruriry."

students should have a say in what
issues SGA diseussos, Henry said, sound-
.ng errt eall to the pubiia. "Lets get the
emails started," he said. Henry wants stu-
dents to send him any ideas they have ror
making the aallege a horror plaeo. "People
have already sent me ideas that they'd like
to see rhanged next year. and I’m going to
be going around door to doorasklng people
what they want to see changed. "
