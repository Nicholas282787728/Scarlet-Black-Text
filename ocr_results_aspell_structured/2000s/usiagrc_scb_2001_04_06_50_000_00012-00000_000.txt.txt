Drill team captain answers pressing questions

it looks like my column was stolen by sports editor Nicho-
las Johnson. Nicholas insists that my column was not stolen,
but rather "intercepted." I'm not so sure about this, but then
i'rn notsure about anything that Nicholas tells me. Either way.
i'rn left to write the sports column. i know a little bit about
sports, like that Dan Marino plays some marl tarball and that
the super Bowl isn't really a bowl. but I don’t know anything
about campus athletics. For instance. i

thought that prof. schrirt was the campus

mascot (and i still think that he would be

a great improvement over the pioneer).

Nicholas incorporated sports into my
arts column so i think that it is only
ion for me to write about the art
round in sports, otcoursc, the
misbegotten result or the union
orartandsports is the drill team,

“Wait!" you say, "crrnnell

doesn't have a drill team. it just isn’t out wayl it’s like how we
doni have the Greek system and don't get well—paying jobs af-
ter gradiiationl"

And you would lie tightrhioughout the years, Grinnell
has had people who pictormed at sporting events, but there
people were either acting in jest or drunk and acting in
lest, We haven't recently ever had any sort otserious group.
This is probably because the women in Grinnell generally
lack pcpt

However, all of this is about to change. Dree Coiiopy ’04,
and Angela sparks '04. are planning on starting a drill team.
What do I think about this? Not that much. lrguys are acting
silly on the ﬁeld. I don’t see a reason why girls shouldn't be able
to act silly on the sidelines, Plus, 1 don't really know what the
drill team does.

I have never been involved in any sort ofcheerleadingr
related activities, unless my foureyenr stint on the pop band
counts, And although I can play a mean “Louie, Louie" on
my oboe, I never on the need to get down on the ﬁeld to
cheer on the team. in fact, I don’t think they would have

let a sliortrl‘ialrcd binnetre With a monotone voice and a
downtrodden look in her eyes near a poniporn. The one
time 1 spoke to a uniformed cheerleader at a game ivas to
tell them that they had been spelling “ALRIGHT” with
two “L's” on their posters tor the last three years, The typo
was never ﬁxed,

I spoke with Dree Thursday to answersome otthc mystcr.
iessiirronndingdrilling and cheering and the birth oitiiis new
era at Grinnell,

Sarah: What is the difference between a drill team and a
checrleading squad?

Drec: Well, drill team is a little inoie focused on dancing.
We don’t yell and clap on the sidelines like cheerieads. We are
more focused on dancing, and
only during halrrime.

sarah: Do you jump like
cheerleaders?

Dree, Weiump. but not like

’ sarah uswell

cheerleaders,

saraii- so like, what are you going to weai?

Dree: We don't really know yet. Nothing that re.
sembles what cheeileadeis wear, Something more dance.
oriented.

Sarah: When and for what are you going to perform rot?

Drce: We were planning on doing halttime routines for
either or both football or basketball. We are also planning on
doing some shows on our own.

Sarah: What do you have to say to the negative things that
people on campus have been saying about the start ota drill
team? '

Dree‘ people are saying negative things?

Sat Yes

Dice: i have heard stories about cheerleaders on the oppos—
ing side. like the cheerleaders from iilinois state, being ridi-
culed by Grinneilians. but i don't think that the students will
make fun of us because we are not cheering for the opposing
team,

Sarah. Wouldn't it just be easier to transfer?

Drce: What>
sooth; Wiiatare your goals, and tan you score goals on drill
team?

Drcc: Basically our goal is to have a good time with dance
and to add something to the college, i want people to enioy
themselves, either through viewing or participating. No, I don't
think you can score goals on the drill team.

Sarah. You don't really think that drill team is a sport, do
you?

Dice: i wouldn’t necessarily call it a sport but it is deﬁr
nitcly, like, an athletic activity, maybe. We don’t use balls or
anything.

saith Did yoi. do this kind or thing in higlischoolz

or Yes, I did drill team in high school.

Sarah: Were you one orthosc people who hated people like
me in high school>

Dtcc: I didn’t hate anyone in high school

Sarah bet you watch Filer/s. too, don't you?

Dr . o, I don't watch TV. Except for stir-vim,

Sarah: Weren't you excltcdwltcn ierti got voted olirlast week?

Drec: Yes, _

strait What are you majoring in?

Dr robably political science.

Sara .Ah.

Drec: Yeah, political science.

sarah Dude, did you see Bringit 0n?

Dr . o.

sarah Arethosetezl?

Dree: What? 0h. or course they're real.

Sarah: So, you’re really going to start a drill team on name
pus?

Dice: Yes.

Sarah And it is nothing like cheerleading2

Dree: No.

so there you have it. Drill team is not cheerleading. And
even though Dice and I are worlds apart both socially and idea-
logically, we can still bond over the goingvon oriast week’s
shocking episode orsririilior.
