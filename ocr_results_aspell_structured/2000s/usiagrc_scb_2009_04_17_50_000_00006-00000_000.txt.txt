once again, Willa is helped by characteis
that represent the four seasons, who serve as
her “fairy godmothcrs" throughout the play.
They help guide her along the way, but also
set up obstacles designed to challenge her
character throughout.

“Seasons” also addresses issues of domes-
tic battery and hostility. “In some ways, this
play celebrates ‘Take Back The Night,’which
remembers those who suffered domestic
abuse." Maureen Kennedy ’11 (Winter) said,
“It's very empowering ifyou’ve been in such a
situation, or know someone who has.”

Jenkins hopes that the issues discussed
will provoke thought and conversation. “This
play is not only about mothers, but also about
family tensioniand a lot of it," he said. “I
guess I’m weird." Jenkins hopes viewers will
“Search for their own interpretationsﬂﬁer
all, 1 like for the play to speak for itself."

Jenkins and the cast admit, though, that
the play’s themes make it difficult to pere
form the roles of characters placed in such
extreme situations. Karl ﬁnds it particularly
difficult to perform Andy's role. “Practicing
rape scenes is difﬁcultiespecially when your
friend is playing the victim."he said. “It feels
weird to ask thorn afterwards, hey, you want
to go to lunch with me?"

Bcdcy's role as an abused wife has give
en her the same attitude. "It's hard to play a
character who has to admit defeat, especially
because the character used to be strong and
struggles to regain that strength. You feel bad
for the character once you becotne part of
them and they become part ofyou," she said.

But like most casts, the acting has had no

With Neverland Players, it’ 5 hard to grow up

Grinncll students in tie dye don various absurd props and strut
amlind giddy with humor. While this really should be the nott
Harris Party, it is instead the dress rehearsal for the Neverland Play-
ers, a show that brings together College actors and grade-school
playwrights.

The show returns after a hiatus this semester, once again tap—
ping into the creative minds of third and fourth graders at Davis
Elementary School,

““16 contact administrators at Davis, and we specifically re
quest stories from third and fourth graders," Cetdircctor Mitch
Avitt ’10 said, detailing the process that brings these stories to the
stage. “These kids are writing about what’s going on in class [and]
what they enjoy learning about."

It’s up to the performers to take it from there. “We pick the
ones that we think we can make into good plays, and we just work
as agroup and write short skits based on the stories,”said actorAlex
Littler'lO.

The stories can mnge from elaborate masterpieces to bizarre
blurbs. one example: “One dayl was drinking rootbecr in my back
yard,and some aliens came and grabbed mewtlooozThen they
took me to Root Beer Island.”

Given that performers often have small plot poins to work
with, Avitt and Ctrdirector Barbara Monaeo ’10 try to give the
actors a lot of freedom in transforming the children’s stories into an
actual performance.

“sometimes we get sort ora bland story and you have to put in
a witch, a fairy godmother, or a thinoceros,"Avitt Said

The rehearsal shows the versatility that the group has to havc to
succeed At one point, the performance leapt from a musical about
a color changing girl to a fifth grader lost on a zoo ﬁeld trip to an
alien abduction

The actors spend some dine performing the 11 or 12 skits end
to ciid during rehearsals, followed by comments and feedback from
the directors and actots. But mostly there is a lot of laughter.

“Literally it’s College students pretending they're kids again,”
Monaco said.

The best moments don’t often come from the performances.
“The funniest parts of rehearsals havejust been reading the stories,"
Littler said.

The hilarity not only brings out the enthusiasm otan eight-

yearrold, but also the mind of a 13ryearrold, as innocent stones can
often bring inappropriate interpretations from the College students
performing them.

“There is enough stutl' that happens [in interpreting the chil-

drcns stories] that we've considcrcd doing a naughty Never-land,"

Avitt said. One story, for emmple, described a character in bed with

laughter and inspiration comes back to Davis Elementary children.
