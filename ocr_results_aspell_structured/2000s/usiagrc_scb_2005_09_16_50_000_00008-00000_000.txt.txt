‘ Anarcho-feminists

nation of males over
females was the first
form of oppression.

' Christian-anarchism
believe that the only
source of authority is
God and that earthly
aurhoriry such as the
government should nor
have power over them.
Leo Tolstoy is the most
famous Christian-an»

ing institutions and

capitalism.

Students seek alternative political perspec

3v JOSE SEGEBRE SALAZAR

Blue, red or neither?

In 2004, a year that saw a war and
a presidential election, Americans faced
a difficult question: vote Democrat or
Republican?

Members of the Radical Students
Collective (RSC) chose neither blue
nor retl.They do not see themselves on
the mainstream political spectrum; they
embrace a radical perspective.

According to one of thcir reprer
sentatives, Emily Iwuc ’08, RSC has a
“self-selecting audience.”

Emily l<lnmcr '09, nnorher i-epree
senrarivc, said irs members are willing
to embrace all different types of views
as long as they are “offthc map of‘tegu-
ler' poliricnl ideology."

RSC is nor an official student group
at the moment, but they intend to regis—
tcr with SGA shortly. The group hopes
to make radical ideologies accessible to
students who are interested

The group hopes to conduct sew
cral projects in thc future.Thcy want to
reach out to political prisoners (through
writing letters) and start a program
called “Food not Bombs," in which the
unused food from 041ml and Cowlcs is
given to rhe Grinnell communiry'rhey
also hope ro bring radical speakers to
campus.

Both representatives (they do not
consider themselves leaders). said that
RSC is a forum for people with radical
preferences. They are anti—authoritar-
ian and anti-capitalist; but they reject
labels. Members can subscribe to every
anarchist tenet or none at all. Klamer
said that she identiﬁed herself with an—
archo-fcminism,while Iwuc did not.

While anarchism is the dominant
ideology, the represenrarives stressed
the diversity of radical beliefs the group
embraces. Iwuc said that she would like
to see three things occur within the

combining theory and practice

Anarchists must confront the inc
hetent contradiction between attendr
ing Grinnell, an elite, private institu-
tion that promotes civic engagement
within rhe system, and being a member
ofa group that seeks to overturn the nor
cepted social hierarchy. But the group
intends to use their opportunities at
Grinncll. “[While] we are here and we
have the resources or our disposal, we
should use them,"Klamer said.

According to Klarner, RSC is “not
interested in doing things mainstream
and condoned by society." They are
interested in providing an intellectual
home for those who do nor idenrify
with a particular party or a traditional
concept. They have only had one meet-
ing so far, during which rhey exchanged
ideas for rheir group's purposes.

Radical Students Collective shela
ters the unrraditional and the unconr
ventionol. They offer a space based on
mutual aid where they hope to provide
different and more radical perspecrives,
ro challenge rhe srarus quo, and strive
to make a difference.
