Well-made musical sucs

ceeds despite shortcomings

011:: should be a catastrophe but isn't.
Overteamest urgency, neurotic self—analysis
and songs that could never be called innovative
weigh it down. But despite all that, it loves its
characters, refuses to be like any other movie
and, ultimately, manages to delight.

Dim follows the story of an unnamed
street performer/vacuum repairman (Glen
Hansard) in Ireland and his relationship with
an unnamed immigrant woman (Nlarkétn ire
glove) who inspires him to record his music
and to try to resolve the problems in his life.
The treatment of their relationship will prob-
ably bewildcr most American audiences who
Want the predictable and superﬁcial fantasy of
Hollywood love.

The movie sometimes takes its duty to
confound expectations a bit too seriously. At
times their relationships platonic awkwardness
makes it a bit predictable, and the dialogue is
occasionally too smart and self-reflective to
feel believable.

But Hansard. besides organic and emotive
singing, also grabs the nuances of his role in
ways that often feel as real as the raw style the
movie is shot in. Irglova also delivers a work-
able performance, though at times she seems
to stumble on lines that should have the most
emotional impact,

The untesetvedly best part of Ome is the
way it is shot. It follows the characters right
into their private lives, into cramped streets
and houses, and into the halfrlit rainy world of
reality. The editing and cinematography ﬂow
beautifully, and the songs intertwine into the
life of the characters. Integrated into the ﬁlm,
the songs achieve a special potver that wouldn't
exist in their painfully normal, Crmajor sings
errsongwriter stereotype selves.

At 86 minutes, Um: passes relatively slow-
ly, perhaps because ofits reliance on music and
dialogue and not on traditional plot structure,
It slows down most dramatically when the
characters enter a recording studio. The actual
recording of the songs in an antiseptic studio
can't exactly compare with Hansard’s fervent
singing of them in the streets,

That may in fact be the lesson of 071w: folr
low your singerrsongwriter self, achieve your
dreams, approach love in a fair and honest way
and any other such earnest beliefs. But the
viewer can reject or even scorn any or all of
these ideas and still have a great time watching
a wellrcrafted movie.
