Aﬂer enduring torment through high school, senior considers Grinnell “best decision" she ever made

Suzy, 1 senior, lcnew she was gay hefore she 1111ew whar gay was. All she
knew 1s a hrnderganener was met she wenred 1o marry a lirrle girl in
second grade. when 1he lirrle girl moved away, i1 “hro11e [her] heart."
When she learned wliar i1 meant 1o he gay in frisr or second grade, “I iusr
know 1 was gay," Suzy said.

This rerlizarion did no1 nttlvcly sneer her uiiril iunior high A1 1111s
pornr, Suzy mo, “1 would lie and make up take crushes ius1so 1 wouldn‘1
ger hearen up," because Iiomoscxuallty was nor 1eeep1ed in her Jewish
commuiiiry

Suzy did, however, come orir 1o her famil 1y in

unroriunarely, coming our in her high school of4,000 snidents was
nor nearly as easy and nor 11 all amusing. “1 am iusr a raging rtereorype,“
suzy said, “[50] hy 1he end ofrhe hrsr day ofhigh school, everyone hnew1
was gay.

suzy soon heeeme 1he 1arge1 of rooms, 1hrears, insulrs, and physical

attractive.” grudencs s1111ed a perrrron 1o hen her rrom changing in me

Tluougliout 1his, Suzy never oomplained to die adminisrioeion. “I didn't

"I thought [Grinnell students]
