For those that are interestedinwr-itin ,rhey
are often discouraged People will t them
to follow another path, so that theywill at
least have something to fall back on. How
would you res ond to ayounger writer who
feels burdene by that sentiment?

If you’re going to think about it in practir
cal tetms,I mean, I just never lied any prob—
lem with becomln a teacher. I had never
taught before but w en I went to the Writers’
Workshop art otrn fellowship was I taught
Freshman 80m etoric its called at the
Universi of Iowa. So I 'ust learned how to
be a teac er and I thoug t this is as respect—
able a way to get a paycheck as any other, As I
became a better teacher I was able to integrate
my teaching life and my writing life together
in my brnin so that now when Im in the class
teaching l‘m still thinking about writing, m
own writing, that’s just sort of how I do it.
certain amount of essimism is warranted in
practical terms, of eing a writer,just because
you can’t plan to make money at writing,
you can’t do it just because of the way that
the publishing industry is, and just the way

CONTRIBUTED
the booksellers don't sell, or whatever. You
just have to be practical about it. When I talk
to youn writers,I don’t really give them ads
vice but sort of sa ,“Look, the writing is on
the wall, you're pro ably not going to make a
lot of money doing this so you have to (i re
out just another job to do, and it woul be
great to be a teacher, it would probably be bad
to be an editor, it’s tough to read that much
and do our own writing."But,I don't know,
I wouldyn‘t discoura e anybody from being a
writer. I think peopﬁe sort of overstate these
things, they sort of exag crate, and partly
there are traces of this kin of romantic idea
of, in order to be an artist you have to so suf-
rcr kind of[laughslv)’0u kind of do, it's rough,
it’s a tou h life. But you know, somehow or
another managed to write this ﬁrst novel
teachlng full time during the day to Hire
wird undergraduates, also teaching at night
every semester and every summer in their
night school at Harvard, raising two young
sons, and mowing the lawn, in so you can
do it, you can write under almost any circum-
stances.

This is an excerpt ironiTinkcrs,“w1ien he
realized that the silence by which he had
been confused was that ofall ofhis clocks
having been allowed to wind down, he unc
derstood that the was going to die in the bed
where he lay." This exce r struck me is a
deﬁning idea ofthe novc . Cm you speak a
little about the morning or clocks in Tin-
kers and why they are so central?

Well, this is one of those funny things,
because the reason that clocks are central to
me, which might be distinct from why they
are central to a reader, as it were, is simply
because one or the dmmatic premises, one of

the givens that I could not change because of
the wrry the novel came to me was just that
this repaired clocks [Harding's grandfac
thetfugo I didn’t think, oh you know what I’ll
do is I’ll write a novel about clocks and it'll
be what I think about time. Its just sort of
no, this guys does clocks and so the complex
of analogies and metaphors and all that sort
orstuerson of arose more organically out or
the exploration of just what it means and l
didn’t want to overrdetermine it. From that
quote, part ofrt is that one of the central metr
aphors, all thatbeing said, one of the central
metaphors otthe sto is 'ust his vigilance in
keeping...iirst ofall re rnds very attractive
the iderr that the universe might be able to be
conceived otos n machine, which ifyou just
kee it in good repair and keep it wound it
WI kccp ninninw. I ilwiys understand thin
in terms of the ciaractei George Crosby, its
wishful thinking, its what hc hopes for the
universe, but precisely bcciuse his life expe-
rience is not )rcdictablc. doesn’t run accords
mg to the coclovork universe. He wishes
the universe is like that precisely because its
not lrkc that, so its very im mum to him to
kccp ill otrhc clocks up in running. so tbir
when he realizes that eve body else has let
the clocks run down, theres something kind
of fatal about the fact there’s no reason for
anybody to wind the clocks buck up, this is
terminal.

Do Kan have metaphors that you live your
life y?

I don't know, pnrtly what I doillm {Mt
cinated with metaphor, because I think that’s
how people think, I think that meta hors
have great generative power in terms 0 real-
ity. I mean, I think that if a culture has mp
lective metaphors by which it lives, it actually
can condition reality will accommodate
itself to metaphors and in these really kind
of strange quantum ways that are very pow—
erful so they're very dangerous and they're
Very substantive and consequential, So by
recognizing that, being a ﬁction writer, a bi
part or’ my 'ob is 1just exploring the power o
metaphor. hic is funny because readers
look at it and they say well he chose clocks
because they’re a meta hot for time, its just
sort of like, no really i you think about it a
little bit more deeply, any writer who is good
can take anythin and turn it into a metaphor
for the cosmos. he classic prime example of
that is Moby Dick, you know where Melville
just basically takes the whaling ship, cuts it
down the middle, shows you the cross seer
tion and just basically goes from job to job,
from activity to activity, and almost every
chapter becomes an essay in which he takes
whatever the very mundane literal task at
hand is and inﬂates and extends :r metaphor
so that it's like a metaphor for the creation of
the universe and then he says, “Oh sto all
this foolishness, you're gonna fall out o the
crows nest," Because every mctnphor fails
eventually, and yet while its being elaborated
you believe in it, it has very real ontological
powers even as you anticipate that power and
integrity eroding.

You mentioned last “tight at your reading

the unique colla inc ad that you had for
purring together ‘Tinkersxl Can you brieﬂy
explain that method?

Well, that’s one oftl-lose thin .The {core
bill analogy is you take what the efense gives
you. When ﬁction comes to me it doesn’t
come to me in a chronologicall linear fashc
ion, so that’s all it is. So what end up with
are just iles and piles orepisodesl think or
it visuallE, and I think if ou look at “Tinkers”
this will be conﬁrmed,“ inkers"runs roughly
chronologically but it almost is experienced
like a series of set pieces or tableaus or it's like
a bunch of paintings, lookin at palntin in
galleries or photogmphs. Alli that's justliow

thite; when ﬁction comes to me Ijust kind
of ct a visual. “Oh, thcrc ho is lying in rhc
befand his ﬁrmily is around him, what does
this mean.” And so I just start parsing out
these moments but then they don’t come to
me in chronological order, so then I have to
subsequently go back and collage them and
rearrange them so that when you read drem
they actually—they're progressive and they're
cumulative and the ’re notjustlike totallyin—
coherent fractured nd of writing,

You mentioned that you actually ph ically
did this, you or on the ﬂoor with allsthese
pages, with these episodes and you ir-
rangcd them,

Yeah, and in that case that was because
I rcilly didn't know What the book wns hilly
about. I mean it really just arrived on the page
is I wrorc it. I knew how it wns gonna end,
right, the guy's gonna die, but just how we
were gonnn wet there I hid no idea, so it was
just ens ofivnndering mound and writing
stuffy... But I did, I actually printed up the
whole manuscript, I cut it up, I used scissors
and trio and srnplcs and Jl thnt ridiculous
stuff. r nd part of rt too is, I mean, in that
sense I also think ofrt in terms oflilte almost
likc music, which is if you have, for exam le,
three sections, three sections about three if—
fcrcnt scenes or three different characters or
whatever and you label them 1, 2, 3, the read—
cr will have a certain cumulative cxpcricncc
ofall of those sections depending on whether
you order them 1, 2, 3 or 2,1, 3 or 3,1,2 or
that sort of thing. I think of them as chords
almost, like oups of notes that at orches-
trated [ogeifen Roughly everytghin goes
chronologicall within that greater c rono—
lo ical kind o spinc,l do a lot otmicro kind
o collaging to sort of get toups of little
scenes and images so that t ey harmonize
with one another in precisel the way that I
want them to, so they create eys,you know

That‘s really interesting It's a bit of a ro—
mantle way ofputting together wriring.

Absolutely,I am unabashedly romantic in
that sense

Once the dust settles here, do ou have a
sense afllowil's changed your - 2

I don’t.The strange thin is that, I have a
wife and two sons and theyre not with me.
Its weird because it's all ha pened, andI have
no infrastructure, I haven't had my family and
my own house even to sort of go back to at
the end of the day. So I kind of live in this
very modest little grad student a artment in
Iowa City. So the immediate e ects are, it’s
just surreal, I just spend all day long doing
interviews, And suddenly you’re making pro~
nouncements [laughs]. And, so you have to
get used to that and you can't be coy about it,
it’s a big deal, it’sjust a big deal, you cant pre-
tend it’s not. But thenjust in terms ofwhat it
means, that’s the kind of thin that you only
know in the fullness oftime. ne thing I can
say is before having won it, the big differ»
ence from understandln intellectually from
afar cause you've seen it rom the outside, but
from the inside what‘s just really striking is
just the magnitude of it. It's big, you know
what I mean? It's sort of big in a way that
like almost any other sort of award is [not] ...
And I think art of it is just because they're
given out in 'fferent categories, there’s 'oure
nalism,l think with a lot of other awar s, it's
sort of like you get outside the literary world
and people son of don't know so much but,
kind of eve bod knows what the Pulitzer
is in a way. hat s 'ust astonishing about it is
just the scale of it,l don’t think it disappears,
you know?
