SGA treasurer
Khandkar resigns

sv LOLA GARCIA

Last week, SGA treasure. Doja
Kliantlkai ‘05 announced his resigna-
tion. Khandkar served on the SGA
cabinet as assistant treasurer during the
20034004 academic yelu and was tren—
surer last semester,

Khandkar told the 888 via email
thar his resignation was the result of
“several factors of a personal nature."

He said he did not anticipate any
major disruption in cabinet following
his resignation. “They should be fine
[without me]," he said.

Assistant treasurer Matt Cleinman
‘06 has already taken Over the rreasur-
cr's duties. “The second semester ofthe
Treasurer’s term is typically more sue
pervisory, to ensure the assistant trea—
surcr knows all they need to, so there is
little effective change," said Cleinman
ofhis new responsibilities.

The treasurer is the only Cabinet
post that entails a twO year commit-
ment. The Assistant Treasurer serves
one year as the assistant and the folr
lowing year in the Treasurer post.Due
to the nature of the position there are
currently no plans to ﬁnd a new assis-
tant treasurer.

Cleinman says that the rest of Cah-
inet has offered to look into creating
a new position for an ofﬁce person to
help with basic tasks. Cleinman said he
currently has no plans to accept the of-
fer for an ofﬁce person. “As of now, 1
think I can handle it, but the offer res
mains open in case I decide I need one,”
he said.

Interpretations of Malcolm X‘s legacy hinge on

said Hendricks. For example, that after his death

Tansey focused on Malcolm X’s attempt to con-
nect African Americans with people of African de—
scent worldwide. Malcolm X wanted to show that
“African Americans had a deeper, richer history than
slavery,"said Tansey.

By trying to turn the civil rights movement into a
human rights movement,Tnnsey explained, Malcolm
X would have gained international allies.

Tansey sees Malcolm x as an educator, primarily a
self-educator. Self-education is Malcolm X’s “impor-
tant legacy, knowledge of self becoming selfepride."

caterine emphasized the Nation oflslam’s explar
nation of the history of the world as a “mirror inver-
sion of the modern Western version of history.” For
example, the “Golden Age of Greece" is replaced
with a vivid retelling of the “Golden Age of the Black
Man,” as Caterine put it.

African Americans are thereby “reoriented toward
an Afroecentric past," This interpretation of history
renders all stereotypes of African inferiority baseless
and was therefore very empowering to young Mal-
colm X.

Caterine also suggested that Malcolm X's “double

an expression ofthe five stages of grief. By seeing rac-
ism “as a product of ‘white devilry,’ it makes it com-

Caterina defended the controversial leader's views
toward violence. “Malcolm X did not idealize vio-
lence,"hecause that would have been to deny its brutal
reality, he said. Instead, Malcolm X, “acknowledged
violence and redirected anger,"
