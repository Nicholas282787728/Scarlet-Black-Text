Mental Health Task Force sug~
gests buffer days before exams

Currently a proposal is windnrg its way through
the mazes of Grinnril College administration to al—
lOw extra “buffer days" for students between the end
oftire semester and the fmrl exam period, This prOr
posal was one of the primary recommendations of the
Mental Health Task Force from the 2003,04 sclmol
year and Originated from a depression and suicide
specialist who visited the campirs following the 2003
campus suicrdes.

According tO task force member Alissa Briggs
'05, the proposal was a popular item, “The task force
brought it to the table a lot,"she said.

“You know lrow you can have the stress of four
papers duo the last week, and then have tour finals
the ncxt,”shc continued. “It doesn’t leave a lot oftinrc
for you to be able to synthesize the material from the
whole semester. Other colleges that my friends go to
have rcading weeks.“

The recommendation to add buffer days has been
referred to the Academic standrng Committee, which
has ﬁnal authority over the school’s calendar, said
Dean orrho coilegciim Swai't1.SW.\l'tZ said that the
“process hasn't started yet,” and that therefore “there’s
been no consideration at this point" about potentially
adding Butfcr Days to the college schedu .

“This issue has started twice rn n_ or years here
and the students have been overwhelmingly opposed
both times," sard Swartz “Our alternatives [if we
add Butler Days] are to stall the school year earlier,
shorten thc breaks, or have a later rclcase datc. Or
we could compress the final exam schedule to three
days." Brit he said the impression that he’s gotten is
that "students [arc] not wanting to be lrcrc any longer
than they have to."

“This is the ﬁrst time the issue has been brought

Cleveland Lounge designated

smoking area

College policy prohibited students from sm0kr
ing in Cleveland Lounge for only a few weeks, The
lounge became the frrst ofﬁcial smoking lounge on
campus earlier this week after SAs in Cleveland sub
mitted a proposal to student Affairs last week.

Facilities Management (FM) is currently workrng
to install proper signs and ventilation in the lounge,
“We want to get it done quickly," Vice President for
Student Services Tom Crady said, FM is currently
considering Smoke Eaters, a snnokrng frlrrarron sys-
tem sometimes seen in bars.

Cleveland Lou nge became offreiail , non-smoking
with all other lounges on campus when the college
revised its smokrng policy at the beginning of this
semester. Students continued tO Smoke in Cleveland,
however. said Peter Clough '06, SA on Cleveland
Third.

Cigarette butts and ashes in the first-floor lounge
became a problem, agreed Clnugh and Cleveland
First and Fit SA Meghan Ford ‘00, There were up
in 15 cigarette butts on the [loot each morning aiOng
with damage to furniture, according to Ford, “That’s
disgusting." Cloiigh said. “Its really gross, and we're
going to get fined for it at the anti ofthe your."

Knowrng stutleiits would continue to smoke m—
doors, Ford trietl to place asht , iii the lounge to
keep it Cleaner. However, cu dians removed these
ashtrays, shc said. Clough [.11de to the Residence

in the lounges too; we wish they Could be there, but
the administration won't let us put them there,”
Cloirgh srrd.

Clough went to Dean for Student Life Jen Kmhn
to request ashtrays for the loirngc. KIOhn suggested he
wrirc a proposal to make Cleveland a smoking lounge,
Clough said. Clough submitted the proposal, along
with Ford and Cleveland Second SA Ben King ‘07
and student Affairs quickly approved it “We thought
that that was a good idea," Crady said. “Cleveland has
typically been a smoking lounge in the pastitl'rut's
why it was chosen, pretty much."

"From my pctspective,l thought it was a pretty
smooth process," Clorigh said. “I went in and had a
problem, and they were pretty receptive.

No other smoking lounges exist at this point.
“VVe’re just not there yet,” Crady said. “we're really
going to have SGA make recommendations or other
students, iftliey want to do tha think we're pretty
open to it."

There could be one or two lounges on each side or
campus, Crady said. “we haven’t decided yet," he said.
"It depentls on demand. we want to knrd or do
what's right and be thoughtful about it."

student Anarrs has received reports or students
continuing to smoke elsewhere on campus, Crady
said, and RLCS have [1|]de to these students, “We're
trying [0 be ﬂexible, real rig rt's a transition period,"
Ctad} said “When it gets to be a problem, then we'll
refer them to Judicial Council." No one has been re»
ferred to iudCo for srnokrng yet, Crady sard.
