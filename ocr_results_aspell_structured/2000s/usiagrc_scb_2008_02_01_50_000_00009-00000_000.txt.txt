Easy steps for easy e-mail

Avoid Outlook Web hassles with a desktop e-mail program

BYDAVID H. MONTGOMERY

Most ofus these dliys receive dozens of e—
mails per day, a mix ofirnporrnnt, ignornhle and
spam. It can be a bit overwhelming. And that’s
why it's so frustrating to me to see someone
log on to their personal
computer and fire up
mailgrinnelledu,

if you happen to
use both a Windows
PC and Internet EXT
plorer, then your mail situation is not too bad.
That’s because you get access to the Windows-
and lE-only "premium"web-mnil service that
includes features like search, rich-text compos-
ing and n relatively user-friendly layout.

if, on the other hand, you are one of the
many studenrs who use a Macintosh or Linux
PC or who use the Safari or Firefox browsers,
you're stuck with the “Light" interface.

Fortunately, you do have one option (and
it’s a good one even if you DO use Windows
und IE.) Desktop email programs take your
email off the internet and onto your com,
puter. They have a number of advantages over
\vebrbaserl mail:

If your mailbox is full and you have a desktop
client, you can store move old e—mails en mane
to your hard drive.
2, Exfaiidtdﬂulili'er. Using a desktop mail
program gives you not only the simple but
vital features rnrssing
from Outlook “Light"
like the ability to search
and write ermails with
different fonts and text
colors, but also more
advanced features like Smart Mailboxes and
photo-rich layouts for e-mail messages
3. Mala/ale IIt‘mlmlT. If oyu want [0 check
your Gr-innell mail and your Ginnrl accounts
on it Web browser, you have to navigate to two
separate sites, enter two separate passwords,
and view the mail separately. With a desktop
ptogiam, you can funnel multiple accounts
into the same program, and vrew your Grinneil
mail and your Ginail and any other accounts
you might have at the same timeidnd even in
the same window, rfyou want.
