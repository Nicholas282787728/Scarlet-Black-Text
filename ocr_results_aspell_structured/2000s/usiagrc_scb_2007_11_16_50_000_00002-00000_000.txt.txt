Grinnellians line up to
receive Fulbright grants

Bv DAVID H. MONTGOMERY

Waiter Liszcwski ’08 is hoping to be spending a year after graduation
relaung on a beach in Crete.

He also hopes to do so for free and build up his resume simultaneously.

The reason that Liszcwski can hope for all this and have good reason to
do so is a prestigious us. state Department grant: the Fulbright Scholar
ship.

This long-running program encourages US. students to travel and one
gage with the world by funding their efforts to study and teach in foreign
countries. It is also one of the postgraduate scholarship programs that
Grinncll emphasizes through its Career Development ofﬁce.

Liszcwski is one of 20 Grinnell students and alumni who have applied
{or financial support from the Fulbright Program, which aims to “increase
mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the
people of other countries," according to the program's official description,
Grinncll’s applicants are seeking two different types ofFulbright grants:

- The us. Student Program, which gives fellowships to recent graduates
to study and do research in foreign universities. Six Grinnell seniors are ap~
plying for these fellowships.

- English Teaching Assistantships, which send U.S. graduates around the
world to teach English in remote areas of foreign countries, integrating with
host communities With the possibility of conducting research.

Llszcwski, who plans to eventually pursue a M.D./'Ph.D. advanced dce
gree, wants to study the aging process of worms at a research institute in
Herakljon, Greece. The program “is what I’m looking for, which is to get
more research before going on," Liszewski said. “It was perfect." The re
search builds on previous work be has done in summer programs at the
University of Chicagtﬁand as a side beneﬁt, his lab is near the beach.

Demonstrating a very different type of research project is Heather Parker
’08, who is applying to study at the Universidad San Francisco de (Alito
in Qiito, Ecuador. She hopes to conduct an independent research project
looking at indiginous residents of Ecuador's mangrove forests.

“Within the past 20 years, there's been a lot of destruction [in the mans
grove forests]," Parker said. "I’d like to go and see how it affects the come
munities there."

Applicants find out in January if they advance to the next stage.

According to Shorb, groups often rely on the Community
Service Center for travel expenses, but then go to the SPC’s
funds for activities. Few, however; prefer this method, and SPC
plans to allocate even less to community service next year, hop-
ing the college will increase the Center‘s budget.

“[SGA] has been as generous as they can, but now they’re
out of money,"said Sllorb.

Marerat Tworncy ’03, who corcoordinatcs Alt Break and

said.

SPC will continue to work with new service groups, der
spite its attempts to withdraw funding from established ones.
“There’s always going to be a need for some funding from
SGA," said Bishop.

Bishop, along with the rest of SPC, will continue to work
with campus groups to get funding, both' for service and for
student activities, But these challenges will help steer them
next semester, "Overall, I think this semester's budget crisis has
been more a lesson to SPC,"McKinlcy said.
