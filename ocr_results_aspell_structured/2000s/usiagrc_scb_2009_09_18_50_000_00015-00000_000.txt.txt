First-year golfers
grow into leaders

By CHRISTIAN CaMlNlTl

After recording an impres-
sive team score 0(360, the third
best team score in the Women's
Golf rerun history, last week at
the Monmouth College Fights
ing Scots Inn‘tadonal. it seems
a safe bet that whatever ﬁrsts
year jitters may have hindered
the Pioneers in their first march
have all but disappeared,

“we're phying well this
yeiu,”Caprr\in AshlenMat'Idorf
‘12 said. “Deﬁnitely a lot better
than last year, but we can sou
improve before conference."

Led by ﬁrst yem Mallory
Messin, who shot an 82 for the
day, the Pioneers placed 4th
overall in the l4—team rouma-
mcnt. just trailing Mcssin were
her teammates Elimbeth But»
net! 113 and Natalie Klee '13,
who put up a 91 and 92, respec-
tively,

“The frrst years have a lot
of poremial."Mat2dorf'1l said,
“With their talent] thinkwe are
going to be very suecessﬁil this
year and in the years to follow,"

The match also marked a
clmrmcic shift in the team's dys
narnic following last season. as
three ﬁrst years moved into the
top spots which had previously
belonged to powerhouse seniors
Amy Livingston and Jordan
Heguy and junior Stephanie

”lfyou asked any one of the
chrcc [first years] ifthey played
to their potcnual, they'd say not
even Close," Coach David Alse»
neault said. Our scores will be
dominated by frrst ycars.Thcy'll
eonsislendy occupy the top
rhrcc spots,"

In just a single oif—scason,
the Pioneers transformed from
a team that was able to comforts
ably rely on die experience and
wherewithal of seasoned vetcrs
arts into a senior'less squad that
must depend on thc abilities or
ﬁrst years never tested in the
NCAA environment HowevV
er, despite the inexperience the
first years golfers have with the
Grinnell program, Arseneault
believes the ﬁrst year players
possess an unusual collective
knowledge of the sport and the
resultant maturity imperative to
success.

“Things did not always go
their way and they really con-
ducted themselves like champi-
ons," Arcsenaulr said “They're
used to the ups and downs of
the sport."

Ifthere was one major obs
stacle for the ﬁrst years in reals
izing their potential immcdﬁr
ately, it was inexperience with
the Gnnnell program. In the
ﬁrst tournament of the season
at Illinois College, the ﬁrst years
struggled with the newness of

the courses and nerves.

“It’s tough to go out and
play new courses every clay
wrthout having seen them be-
fore," Messin said, "But since
the ﬁrst match 1 have gotten
more conﬁdent in playing with
college girls '

The upward Ltend in firushes
over the past few weeksya 9th
placc frnish at the Illinois Col-
legc Invite, a sth place frnish at
the Knot Invitational and a 4th
place frnish at Monmourhiis a
direil result crthat gained con-
ﬁdence and ncwfound comfort
playing on the college level.

“I am becoming much more
conﬁdent in my game snaregyr"
Klee said. “Coach Arseneault
rs helpful rn teaching us course
management strategies too.As a
whole,I think the ﬁrst years are
doing extremely well since we
are just starting to become ac—
climated to college and playing
collegiate golf."

As the season moves into
its second half and die nerves
ofa new year start to fade, torus
begins to shift to the Midwest
Conference Championship.

“We sell have a few more
weeks and the team is improv-
ing very rapidly,” Elaine Tea '12
said "Especially since we have
motivation now that we might
win conference."

Conference play gives
soccer fresh start

The team has also suffered numerous setbacks, in-

both physically and mentally stronger for it. showing
tremendous promise and drive

“I think our mentality has gotten a lot better,"
Dylan O'Donoghae '11 said, “Knowing that when
people get healthywe can always step it up, data seeing
that unpravcment with healthy players rs really nice

“'It is clear that this season is one for growth."
Hardy said. Early this season we had to Compensale
for many injuries. Out bench has been small so there
have been some accommodations on the ﬁeld to play

“If we get a Setback, just keep trying to push for

in conference, there's no going back You just have to

continue playing game after game,"

These obstleles forced the team to mist each other

Despite the setbacks, O'Donoghrre wants to let

won't be walked on

"I'm sure odicr teams have looked at the website,
and said, ‘Hey, Grinnell’s fallen oer 1 bit this year,”
O'Donoghuc said “But we're still playing Grinnell

history ofheing one orthc better teams in the Mldwst

still all business, we'll come up with good standings."
