OPINION

March 3, 2005

 

Are you a headline junkie.

Aquick look at internet news headlines on Feb.
27 reveal that Test Scores Not Lowered by Televit
sion"(rm/ rum), and "Chocolate Linked to Lower Blood
Pressure"(precedent),

Though rhcsc hcadllncs are honest in presenting
informatron to the Ameiicriii public, they can also be
tnrsleading

The AOL article mentions that there is lots of evi-
dencc that educational telee
vision is good for children
while violent content “is
related to antisocial aggres—
sive behavior,” but that this
study only dealt with test
scores. It was based on stat
tistics of preschoolers from
the 19405 and 19505 when
television was first introduced in America.

In the chocolate study, the scientists said, “it’s too
early to conclude it was chocolate that led to bet-
ter health.” Other experts mentioned that excessive
amounts of chocolate “can make you fat 7 a risk for
both heart disease and high blood pressure." What a
shock.

I would wager that many Americans, especially
young web surfers, reatlrng these articles will repeat the
headlines during their day. Maybe they Will use it as
a .bJrgrlining tool [0 watch morc TV, or as an excuse
to eat morc ClIOCOlsllc.Wl(l10uE understanding thc full
implications of the studies.

We at Grinneil understand that scientific studies
are complex and prone to peer review, and their re-

 

sults should not be oversimpliﬁed But those who do
not understand this maybe mrsleud by a generalroed
headline.

A few days ago, someone told me, “you know that
dict does not affect your chances of getting ca.rccr."l
replied, I have not done research on the subject, but
I can assure you that ifone eats well, or is physically
healthy, they Will be better able to cope wrth disease
and cancel Also, studies
on cancer are conducted on
sample populations and the
results do not necessarily
apply to all. Have you ever
heard the word “anomaly?”

Nevertheless, Ameri—
cans are obsessed with
health and beauty. Just take
a look at news headlines, or read an average magazine.
We are alvmys looking for the next health tip or the
new workout routine. We e-mail tips to friends or give
people advice on how they should eat or exercise. of
ten, these tips come directly from headlines, Not only
do people too hastily prescribe headlines, doctors often
rush to fix our health problems with shortsightedness.

We go to the doctor with a horsy cough: Give me
the best you got, Ive got a job interview on Friday '
More likelv than not, your doctor will give in to your
sad eyes and whiny voice, even ifit is not good for' you
in the long run. Just last week' in the New Yarl Timer,
David Leonhardt published an article on the problem
ofmisdiagnoses in America rn which he explained that
doctors “are not actually paid to come up with the right

diagnosis. They are paid to perform tests and to do sur
gery and to dispense drugs.“ This emphasis on tests,
surgery and drugs precludes conversations on holistic
healing.

I've seen how a rrtotc holistic approach to healing
works. Several years ago my grandmother's doctor pier
scrrbed Lrprtor for her high cholesterol. She refused to
take it because she was worried about the side effects
By exercis' gand eating well, she balanced her cliolcy
tcrol and at 74 years old redicarion free

Though similar rn some ways bodies are different
It is problematic that many alloparhic doctors have no
intuition into healing as a holistic process. I would even
go so fai to say that psychiatrists are even worse and
more dangerous. They often rush to prescribc ltit
depressant drugs instead of working more holistically
with their patients. People have too much faith in the
MD approach and not enough confrdence in the holis»
tic approach, which is stigmatized as hippy or foreign.

I am suggesting that we change the way we think
about our health. We should know our bodies better,
Let's not assume that chocolate will lower our blood
pleasure, ol that television will not lower our test scores
Let's not have too much faith in doctor's prescriptions,
We should seek good healers whether they are ‘rlllO’
pathie, or homeopathic doctors, or Chinese herbalists,
If one really needs to be onmedrcatrorr, then by all
means take it, as long as the diagnos' is correct,

And next tune a health nut prescribes a headline

heridlliie this week, ‘Are you a headline iunkie?

Mixing daffy dancing with sober Saturdays

my not-too-disrant past, an anonymous

A confused silence ensued.

“But-hut, you were dancrng like you

"But sometimes you looked like you

“I’m not a good dancer,"1 explained.

"You’re sure you weren't drunk?"

“Yes.”

“Really?"

“Yes!"

So I’ve been accused more than
once ofberng an eccentric dancer (I use
eccentric as a euphemism for “the

But my concern at the moment is
not to defend my incompetent dancing
abilities, but to explain, and I suppose
defend, nry decision to edopr an alcos
holtfree lifestyle.]ust what the heck
is my deal, -
anyway?

Firstly, I
don’t think
that alcohol
is rnherencly
evil, or that
people who
drink are bad. I don’t believe that nont
drinkers are better or morally superior
to drinkers. I’m not just waiting to turn

I simply have no desire to drink. It’s

many of the aspects of drinking culture.

I dislike obnoxious behavior. I'm not
a fan of having beer spilt on my head.
I don't like it when people break thrngs

No points for you

think the world would dojust ﬁne with
less vomit in bushes, in bathroom sinks,
on dormitory ﬂoors.

However, this list undoubtedly leads
to the rebuttal, "Vi/ell, you sure can drink
and not do any of thc abovementioncd
things. You
can drink
and not
be drunk."
While I do
agree that
there is al»
ways the case
of the individual who drinks to be social
and not to get dnink, this qualification
does not resolve my prime motivation
to remain sober. In a nutshell,I am ext
tremely uncomfortable with the idea of
usrng a chemical, a drug, to have fun.

I do not need not desire an altered
consciousness to enhance my week-
end enjoyment. I can go to a dance. to
a party, to a movre, to a small gathering
of friends, and for me, that's enough. I
think that life is sweet even when sober,
that the people in my life are fascinate
ing in themselves, that consciousness is
not to be feared, biit to be embraced.
Now, I don’t share these views in order
to harbor an “us and them" mentality.
I'm not trying to convcri anyone. People

drink. I understand that. I accept rr.1ni
notjudging rhosc who do rt Most ofrny
friends drink, and I still love them and
they still love me.

Yet one of the difﬁculties I ﬁnd as
a nontdrinkcr (aside from the loneliness
that can stem from being the only sober
person in the room) is that when 1 go
to a party and politely decline a plastic
cup, some people assume I'm there to
cross my arms and glare at them. I like
to have fun, too. I don’t go out with has
rention to scowl at the actions of others.
Please don't get defensive and think that
because I choose not to drink that I also
choose to loathe those who do. Would
you have serious issues with someone
who hates papaya when it‘s your favorite
dried fruit) Methinks not.

Drinking plays a large role in the
cial lives ofmany Grinnellians, but a dry
contingent does exist on campus. And as
one of those individuals who will con-
tinue to rock out at Harris sober, to play
Taboo on Saturday nights with my floor
mates and perhaps even attend those
school sponsored Bingo and Karaoke
iiights,I want to stress that if you think
college life is somewhat diminished with
the absence of alcohol, you’re mistaken.
Many ofus are doing quite well without
it.

In St. Louis, toasted ravioli is a staple of the cafetet
ria lunch. (Toasted ravioli is very like Griiincll’s “fried
raviolifolily better). In my grade school,we got toast-
ed ravioli once a month, and everyone got exactly six.
Even in high school, we received such paltrytseeming

, amounts. And every student would Lhink,“IfonlyI had
one more ravioli,1 would be happy."

Cleaning trays in cowlcs, I see my childhood, in
large amounts of ravioli, washed down the drain. Its
heartbreaking So next time you waste ravioli romaine

the freedom efnivieli that you have. And eat your ravi—
oli.
