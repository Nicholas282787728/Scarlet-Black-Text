As the spring sports season starts up, baby
squirrels aren’t the only new faces on campus.
This spring, Sandra Faulkner, Grinnell High
School’s cross country, varsity men's basket-
ball, and varsity men’s track coach joins the
Grinnell College campus community as the
new women’s softball coach.

While she attended Grinnell High School
and Central College, in Pclla, Iowa Faulkner
actively participated in sports such as basket-
ball, softball and track. Faulkner said she be-
lieves that coaching is a natural progression
from her intense dedication to sports in her
earlier life.

“[Coaching] starred offwith being an athe
lete. and still wanting to be a part ofsports and
still wanting to be competitive, and still want
i g to be part of the game situation, it's the
next step in after being an athlete," Faulkner
said. “ You're more likely to be a coach in those
athletics you excelled in."

As a Grinnell native, she finds comfort in
returning home and coaching students at both
the high school and college level in the sports

she once participated in, "I think it has to do .

with being a hometown kid and coming back
and wanting to work at my old high school,
and working with some of my old teachers,”
Faulkner said, "it's just bceu a really neat ex

Faulkner's past coaching experiences en»
sure that she will push her players hard. “My
expectations are very high, my standards are
very high," Faulkner said. “I want them to
compete to Win and just do the little things
right to get to the next level.”

Faulkner’s expectations don‘t surprise Bri-
anna Gallo ’11 and Veronica Reavis ’11, who
had Faulkner its an assistant softball coach at
Grinnell High School. They understand the
type ofintensity she brings to coaching.

"She hasn’t changed a lot, she just expects
more out ofus," Reavis said. “She‘s just build-
ing on more to our softball skills."

Faulkncrs intensity can be seen in the
daily throwing and hitting drills, when she'll
occasionally hit volleyballs with the softball
bats. Even though Faulkner's difficult drills
work the players, she brings a warm personal-
ity to the field.

“When she was an assistant coach back at
Grinnell high school, she would warm up with
us and tell jokes," Reavis said. “She was always
encouraging and supportive of the girls who
didn’t go on the field.”

While Faulkner has high expectations of
Grinnell women, she believes that they are on
the right track, “[The women softball players]
have come in and done everything I’ve asked to
do,” Faulkner said. “And I think they’re risen

to my expectations of how they need to play.”

NFL drama: Do the Patriots set their own agenda?

1 really want March to get here.Yes it's technically March al-
ready, but the NCAA Tournament hasn't started yet so it doesn’t
count, In order to deal with the continuing boredom that is the
sports scene, let's take a look at the NFL’s free agency period
which, although short on the movement ofbig names, has had
its share of drama with some interesting consequences.

One of the “big” free agent signings was that ofTJ Housh-
mandzadch by the Seattle Seahawks. Now, I'm not exactly
thrilled that Housh didn't sign with the Vikings, but I under—
stand his rcasoning of worrying about Minnesota’s quarterback
situation, even if Seattle's is also
pretty shaky. What I cannot respect, , a
though, is how he handled himself , ,
through the negotiations. on two d
iffcrent occasions he set deadlines
for when he was going to sign and
then proceeded to break them as '
fans otthe scahawks, Bengals and Vikings looked on with great
anticipation.

What exactly was the point of these deadlines? The offers
reportedly didn't change because of his antics. This might be
the biggest decision of his life and the market wasn't as fruitful
as he would have hoped, but what did he think these arbitrary
time limits would do? seriously, take as much time as you need.
If you need days, weeks, months, take whatever is appropriate.
But to do something like this that has no real point and only

' Minnesota '
Miracle Man

serves to yank around fans of the game is inexcusable. All you
need to do isjust put a little thought into your actions and this
could all be avoided.

On a different note, maybe the most notable move of the
oﬁ'scason ms the Patriots trading Mike Vtahel and Matt Cas»
sel to the Kansas City Chiefs for the 34th overall pick in the
draft.This, on the surface seems like a steal for the Chiefs, but
you have to remember that Cassel isn’t going to have Moss and
that Patriots’ offensive line to help him out. And while Vrabel
may be extremely valuable to the Chiefs’ young team because

of his ”veteran leadership"—he has

i . almost no real value for the Patric

ots.Theyjust don‘t need a coach on

the field, and as an actual linebacker

he'll be competent for a few snaps

a game at most, After a semisthore

ough breakdown 1 would say there

wasn’t anything wrong with the trade. but that’s before the int
trigme starts.

Rumor has it that although the Patriots accepted the 34th
overall pick they were offered the 12th overall pick in a deal that
would have scntJay Curler to the Lions and Matt Casscl to the
Broncos among other things. Why would the Patriots want a
pick 22 spots lower in the draft? Yes, the #12 would cost more in
guaranteed money than he's worth and the Patriots have made
a name for themselves by picking underrated players at the end

of the first round. but they could just as easily turn that pick
around, drop down a few slots and pick up some second day
draft choices.

Some think that trading Cassel and Vtabel was a parting
gift for Scott Pioli, formerly in the Patriots from office, and the
man who now runs the Chiefs. The thing is, everybody seems
to hate Belichick and the Pats anyway, so 1 doubt this even reg-
isters with them. So what could be gained by leaking the trade
rumor?

Well, as it turns out, Jay Cutler likes to throw hissy ﬁts;
imagine that. He's a fine young (3%, but he has the propensity
to run his mouth from time to time. As soon as he heard about
the rumors he refused to speak to the Broncos administration
and instead demanded to be traded. At this point, the Vikings
initiated contact with the Broncos and, frankly, if this Cutler
temper tantrum causes him to be wearing purple next year I am
all for it. ,

Denver claims they have nixed all trade talk, but the whole
debacle is putting former Patriots offensive coordinator and new
Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels in some hot water. So, the
Patriots look bad and no one really cares. the Chiefs have made
a good trade, and the Broncos have taken two steps back even
before the season has starred. Oh, and who was rumored to have
lcakcd this trade to the press? The Patriots, All I would like to
say, ifthis is true, is that this is how you nin a football teameif
this is true, my god that is how you run a football team.
