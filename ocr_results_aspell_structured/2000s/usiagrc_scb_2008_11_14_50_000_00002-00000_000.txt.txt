Tibet alters independence stance

Jim Malewitz examines the evolving dispute over Tibetan relations with China

Under the radar of mainstream media, the Pros—Tibet mover
ment has recently reached a ciiticaljunctuic. After the latest
round of failed negoriarions between China and Tibet's gow
ernmentsinscxilc, large questions loom for Tibetan national-
ists and the future of ChineserTibetnn relations as a
whole.

Last week, the Dalai Lama announced that he
will abandon his Middle Way Approach towards Ti-
betan independence and instead adopt a less com»
promising approach. The previous Middle Way Ap-
proach meant acknowledging Chinese rule over Tibet while
simultaneously advocating for more governmental autonomy.
Tibet's political and spiritual leader indicated he has officially
lost faith in the Chinese government and that his approach has
not succeeded in bringing beneﬁcial change to Tibet over its
zosycar span.

NcXtMonday in Dharamsala,india,Tibet’s goverrimentsins
exile will hold a special meeting ro discuss new policy options.
While the Dalai Lama will be present at the meeting, he
said the Tibetan people will ultimately
shape the wayTibetans move forward.

It is difﬁcult to tell wheie Tibet—
ans will decide to go from here.
some ProrTibet groupsi
including the 70,000smember
Tibetan Youth congress—have
long advocated outright indepen-
dence, even promoting violence as
a means to achieve it, and some
Tibetan elites may think the Dalai
Lama's admission of failure gives cIe-
dence to such a radical approach. But many
members of the exiled governmenr still maintain the
necessity of a non-violent strategy. Monday's meeting
will most likely provide the venue for spirited debate.

At 73 years old and in worsening health, the Dalai Lama
has made an effort to gradually decrease his political role within
Tibet’s exiled government.This recent news seems to represent
an acceleration of this process.

But even playing a reduced role, the mere presence of rhe
Dalai Lama may stiu signiﬁcantly impact political discourse.

News Analysis

While he may not ofﬁcially formulate Tibet’s new policy, the
Dalai Lamas enduring political legitimacy will likely prove in:
ﬂuential,

While rhc upcoming weeks will cerrainly prove Signiﬁcant
in forging the future of
the Tiber movement, it
still won't face its largest
test until the Dalai Lama
passes away. While Tibetr
an monks begin the long
process of ﬁnding and raising a new Dalai Lama, the Tibet
Autonomous Region may see increased unrest fomented by the
lack ora unitying leader and China’s likely attempt to name a
new Dalai Lama.

Tibet may avoid this mass confusion if, as some Tibetans
speculate, the current Dalai Lama goes against centuries oftra-

dition and names his own successor, But

this solution remains imperfect as it would

create legitimacy issues among a

large contingent of Tibetan tradi-
tionalistst

In the midst of this change
in Dharamsala, China remains

unequivocally strong in its effort to
maintain the status quo within Tibet.
Thus, even the most drastic changes in
Tibetan exile policy are unlikely to affect

a PRC regime holding all the cards.
Even ifBeijing were to recognize the
unsustainable nature ofits cutrentTibet
policy, PRC leadership could still not at-
ford to risk domestic legitimacy by grants
ing concessions to Tibet. But although we
cannot expect a Chinese change in attitude in
the discernable future, the potential for signifi-

cant changes in Dharamsala still proves intriguing.
