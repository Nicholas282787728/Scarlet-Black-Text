Cleveland residents
confused over door
construction

Br HARLEY CHANG

Two weeks ago, the sound of pounding
hammers woke Cleveland lst residents at 8:00
a.m.The clatter came from Facilities Manage-
ment (FM) constructing a new door to the
Cleveland computer lab, placed farther down
the hallway than the lounge entrance, the only
way to enter the lab in past years. Plans for the
door were initially put forth as part of the final
step in preventing people from smoking in the
Cleveland lounge, according to Assistant Dean
of Students and Director of Residence Life So
Orientation Andrea Conner.

Ifthe current system of randomized cam-
pus security patrols still doesn’t solve the prob-
lem of smoking within the dorm, the lounge
door would be locked and ﬁnes would be put
in place for violators, according to Conner,
However, Connner noted that current patrols
have not ran into a smoking problem so for.

The past conﬁguration of the computer lab
involves entering through the loungeiprev'ir
ously a smoking lounge that has been at the
center of smoking complaints since the lowa
Clean Air Act banned smoking on campus
in Fall 2008. Conner and FM decided it was
best to make a new door to the lounge and seal
oFf the old
e n t r a n c e,
so that stun
dents utir
lizing the
c o m p u t e r
lab would
not be puns
ished if the
lounge were
to be closed.

The door was originally planned to be con-
structed during the summer. However, heavy
renovations planned for Loose Hall forced
the Loose construction to be moved ahead to
spring Break. according to Conner.

The construction project of the door itself
largely drew indifference from Cleveland resi-
dents, but the construction lasting throughout
the day for the past two weeks drew many
complaints of the students in the dorm.

A student living right across from the con»
struction who has asked his name be withheld

, said the noise ms unbearable.

“It's not too big ofa problem for me," he
said, “I have a class at 8:00[a.m.] and I’m used
to getting up early. But my roommate, his ﬁrst
class is at 10 [am] and he's really pissed about
the whole matter. I’mjust a bit upset our RLC
didn’t inform us of the construction before-
hand.”

Jamaland RLC Eric Vos has been talking
with students with complaints about the noisy
construction and dispelling their frustrations
since the construction’s beginning, and blames

' the late warning to poor communication with
FM,

“1 actually had an email ready to be sent the
moment FM gave me the word," Conner said.
“However, FM never infotined us and I actu-
ally found out about the start of the construc-
tion from a student."

Once Vos found out about the construe
tion, he sent an or mail out to residents of
Jamaland explaining the construction and thc
miscommunication.

Search committee panel communicates with College

The Presidential Search Committee reveals its selection process last Tuesday

BY PETER SULLIVAN

Until the moment Grinnell College’s pres-
ident-elect Dr. Raynard Kington walked out
on stage, no one but the Presidential Search
Committee knew the process and results of
the search process. The Grinnell community
was informed at a search committee panel last
Tuesday

The search committee, consisting of seven
trustees, four faculty members, one alumnus,
one student and one staff member, began their
work in July by splitting into two groups—~one
to communicate with the campus about its
hopes for a new president, and one to write
“Grinnell Perspectives," a document describ-
ing the College to the candidates and what it
was looking for in a president.

Members of the Grinnell community and
others nominated candidates for the job and
the search firm hired by the committee, Isaa—
cson Miller, then collected biographical infor-
mation. On Nov. 16, the committee reduced
the list down from about 200 candidates to
around 30, before choosing 10 finalists. The
10 ﬁnalists were interviewed in Chicago in
mid-january. From these 10 came the final
four, who wcrc all then vetted by the search
firm,The committed further cut the 10 to four
after they held individual dinners for the can-
didatesThe committee conducted a final int
terview on Feb. 10 and 11 in Des Moines,and
the committee unanimously recommended
Kington to the Board ofTrustees on Feb. 12,

who in turn voted unanimously to make him
the College’s 13th president.

A central topic of discussion at the panel
last Tuesday ms the decision to not bring the
candidates to campus to meet with the wider
community, as had been the case in the search
for President Russell K. Osgood.

“How do you encoure
age candidates to stay in
the running if they’re not
sure it will remain confi—
dential?" said Jack Mutti, a
member of the committee
and Professor of Econom—
its.

Mutti explained that
if the candidates came to
campus they may have
faced negative repercust
sions trom their tormer employers. To this
end, conﬁdentiality was a priority in the decie
sion making process.

The decision tochoose a president with
no experience working at a liberal arts inst-r
tution brought a question from the attendees.

“We decided at the very beginning we
were not going to limit our search to those
with experience at a liberal arts institution,"
said Daniel Reynolds, a member or the com»
mittee and an Associate Professor of German.
"Rather we would look at those who would be
a good leader ofa liberal arts institution."

Jun Gross, member of the committee llnd

”We derided at the very begins

ﬂing we were not going to limit our

ieartll to those with experience at a
liberal art: institution.”

Daniel Reynolds

Associate ProfessorofGerman

Professor of French, said at the panel that she
too had concerns about his background in acae
demia..

“The way he responded to me was very
heartening," Gross said.

Committee members thought he spoke
well on the strategies to run a college.

“We were impressed by
his instincts on how to push
the conversation further,"
Mutti said.

Jon Richardson '10, the
only student on the Presie
dential Search Committee,
addressed studenes’ con»
cern that Kington’s medical
research on the effects, of
drinking would mean new
alcohol policies at the Col»
lege,

“[That] was a concern of mine also, but it
wasn't something that continued to be a con—
cern of mine after he addressed that," Rich-
ardson said. “He was very clear about notjust
coming in and putting rules in place.”

Richardson also stressed how well the
committee worked together, perhaps a surprise
due to the current tensions between students,
faculty and the administration,

“I thought I would be going into this with
my boxing gloves on," Richardson said. "[But],
the trustees version of Grinnell and my vere
sion meshed very well ":
