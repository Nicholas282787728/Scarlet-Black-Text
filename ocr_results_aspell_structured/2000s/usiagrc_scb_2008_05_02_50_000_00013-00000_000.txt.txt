Socially responsible investing and Trustees

Communication between students and Trustees is Vital to making ethical financial choices

Entrusting trustees

thn Giiiriiell blatantly liar-vests its one
dowment from corporations with questionable
ethics, taking no care to cover it up (especially
when compared with our “pccr institutions"),
students should take a stand. And it is the
duty of the nusrees to demonstrate that they
are attentive to student petitions, movements
and sentiments.

After collecting nearly 200 student signa-
tures on a petition
to the trustees to
consider new ways
to responsibly in-
vest, the Students
for Responsible Ins
vesting (SR1) sub
mitted a proposal to
them last weekend
before their trianr
rural meeting.

The proposal included ideas for a new
committee. It called for greater transparency
in how the college invcsts its money, and sup

and the trustees has been steadily improving
over the years, and they have responded to some

in light the recent upswing in student in—
volvement, trustees should take into account
and respond to student motions quickly.

Eat as well as drink

Everyone loves bar food for its napkins

Brit ever since the pub opened earlier this
semester, Grinnell
students have been
drinking copious
amounts of beer and
neglecting to order
the many tantiliz-
ing food options (see
story on page 1).

While some stu»
dents may not care
that they have missed out on the tasty artis
choke dip or zesty spicy chicken wings. if the

Thanks for shuttles

Let's take a moment to thank Campus
Security. Not only do Steven Bri '06; emails
save us from thundersnow, but their recently
instituted grocery shuttle service just makes
life easier. And that's always nice, especially
around this stress—tilled time oryear.

Here’s the deal if you're rror already far

Day of silence

My alarm buzzed, jerking me out of a
deep sleep. As I reached over to turn it off,
I remembered: I wasn't speaking today. The
thought made me feel a little claustrophOs
bit.

1 showered and dressed, smiling at my
roommate a little apologetically as I passed
her on my way to the bathroom. Ready, I
headed to the cafeteria, armed with my Ciri-
ncsc textbook to study for the test I had to
take in an hour.

sporting my two orrny close friends, we
hired our hands in acknowledgment and I
sat down. We sat there, chewing and ocean
sionally exchanging eye contact and smiles
as I went through my ﬂashcaids, it was the
beginning ofa long day.

A few days befoie,l had decided to par—
ticipate in the day of silence organized by
QJCCI’ People of Color and the Stonewall
Coalition in honor otLawrence King.

Lawrence, a 15-year old boy from my
home state of California, was murdered on
account of his sexuality and gender express
sion. I jumped on the chance to display my
outrage and horror.1 would do anything to
case the cold list that clenched my heart
whenever I thorrghr ofthe tragedy

I had assumed that Grinnellians would
be supportive, And for the most part, they
were.

I only received negative comments from
a total of three or four people, out of the
many that I encountered that day

In class, one person said,“What docs rliis‘

accomplish other than making you frustrate
ed [from not being able to talk],) Nothing,"
Ar my lunch table, over half the people there
were participating in the day ofsilence.

One person continually made comments
about the uselessncss ofwhat we were doing,
and a few people (who were not participate
ing in the day) repeatedly tried to accuse of

“cheating" for various reasons,

I am perfectly accepting of other poor
ple's decisions not to participate in the day;
however, making light of people’s decision
to commemorate the tragedy and spread
awareness is simply not acceptable.

It is an insult to Lawrence King’s mem-
ory, and to the efforts of everyone who is
striving for equality in this world.

The hare crimes in February, as well as
my experience last Friday, made me realize
how far we still have to go,

I would love to believe that Girnnell is
a perfect, happy bubble of acceptance and
love, brrr we're ﬂawed, irist like everyone else.
We must struggle toward equality, just like
everyone else.

In the timeless words ofDi, Martin Lu-
thci King, Jr, as quoted to the incoming
class of 2011 on the first day of New Stur
dent Orientation: “The are of morality is
long, but it bends toward justice."

I applaud the organizers of Pride Week.
and the Day of Silence, for bringing us a
little closer to Dr, King's goal.

SAAC explains

I’m writing in response to the article last
week about athletes and community scrr
vicc. 1 was disappointed when i read it for
many reasons, including its absolute miSs
representation of facts.

It suggested that the Student Athletic
Advisory Council was somehow remiss in
its duty to the community by holding only
a skills day.

The fact is that the Midwest Conference
asks that SAAC hold one community ser-
vice event per year, preferably either Special
Olympics or Habitat for Humanity.

This does not work for Gi'innell be-
cause, unlike rlre other schools at our con-
ference, the special Olympics in Iowa arc

nor as large and are thus fully booked and
have no need for the college's help,

We could not participate in Habitat for
Humanity because it is at this point non-
existent in Grinncll.

We decided we would hold a camp for
the kids in the community instead, like we
did last year, because the children seemed to
enjoy the experience, as did the athletes,

I know the Sij was fully aware of this
information and chose to omit it because
I was there when Darcy VViutl was llller’
viewed and relayed this information.

I think the decision to intentionally
misrepresent what was occurring was ir-
responsible and an unnecessary stab at the
athletic community.

I also find it interesting that the S558
apparently expects all athletes to do come
munrty s vice as a room

I'm curious, do the members of the 569’]!
all chip iii together to do some sort ofmm,
inrinity activity every year?

On top of that, do the individual staffs
do their own sort of community service
event? Or does the naughty sports staff, like

that bad softball team, not really do anything ,

for the community?

I think any athletic team that chooses
to do community service, like the root-
ball team and the women’s basketball team
who cleaned up Arbor Lake Park a few
weeks ago, should be praised for helping
the community, particularly since there is
nothing about a sports team tlrar inherently
involves community service

Athletes join teams to play sports, and
some athletes, as individuals, join cominus
nity service organizations to do community
service.

In the future, I’d appreciate if the SE53
did not choose to write unnecessarily sensas
tional stories at the expense ofother groups
on campus.
