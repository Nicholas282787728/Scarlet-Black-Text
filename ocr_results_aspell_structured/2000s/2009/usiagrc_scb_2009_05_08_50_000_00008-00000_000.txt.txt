Here we arc, dear readcrs, at the end ofthe
year and the last of my short-lived series of
columns] thought it might be an appropriate
time to address its name. In case you haven't
been paying attention (where have you been,
for reaP), my column is titled “The Ethieal
Shit.” Despite the fact that this is indeed “bore
rowed" from a book and not necessarily the
most inventive name. I chose it for a very spcs
eifie and strategic purpose

I'm a big believer in reclamation, and this
is a label l've now chosen for myselrwith care-
Ful consideration and deliberation. Maybe it’s
important to eitplain my personal, self-defined
slut. Firstly, the slut is not a bad person, amoral
or misguided. Secondly, the slut is Conscien’
tioiis, healthy and aware of the risks and ob
ligations that come with sexual conmct with
others. Thirdly, the slut works toward creating,
maintaining and ending sexual relationships
intent on respect, pleasure and safety

The label “slut"is alive and well nt Grinncll.
As l've grown into my sexuality and become
sexually experienced, I've been able to differ
cntiate what is so often used negatively from
my own idea ofsluttincss and sexual promise
cuity. Being aware of your needs and desires
while remaining cognizant of issues of sexual
health and violence is crucial to being a sexus
ally whole person. If those needs and desires
involve multiple partners, so be it I don't care
ifyou have slept with 12 people or two, what's
important is taking care-of your selfibody,

mind, and junk.

In my column, I’ve addressed issues that
may be considered sluttyifrom making out
with every member of your class in a pizza
joint to intentionally leaving your best undies
in someone's room, from touching yourself
(ooh) to touching others (ooooooooooooh)—
but that’s the point. Every other week, I tried
to emphasize that being healthy and respectful
in your sexual encounters, with yourself and
others, is the most important thing.

The senior class is just
a little over a week away
from graduating and going
off into the big, crazy, sexy,
scary world and the rest
of y’all will be out there at
least for the summer. We
always talk about how special and different
Grinnell is, and there’s always that weird, awkt
ward and pretty heteronormativc statement
relayed to firstsycars that Grinnellians always
end up marrying each other <also,why do they
tell us that when we're all 18 years old and
already terrified of college?!). so if we really
just can’t manage to date other kinds ofpcople,
it’ll be intercsting to see how we do in the real
world given how many ofus will still be single
when we leave this placc

I’m convinced that there are awkward,
smart, selftdeprecating, vaguely political but
personally apathetic, horny people everywhere,
although perhaps in lesser concentrations than

May 8 2009

at Grinncll. I'm also convinced that a lot of us
just learn how to function in real life. It’ll take
time to get back to comfortably, safely and dis-
creetly being slutty. Bur almost everyone dates
in the real world and, chances are, they have
sex too. Of course, there is a danger to noting
sexual outside ofour small community, where
the label of“slut" is wholly negative and sexist.
Navigating the sexual world beyond Grinnell
will be different, where heterosexism and hos
mophobiaandmisogynyareoftenlesslrowned-
upon and
more out
in the
_o p e n .
But with
the right
to u e h e s
of respect, safety and sensitivity, you can her
come or continue to be an ethical slut. Maybe
you'll change the way others view sexual be-
havior for the better and the ethics of slutti-
iiess will prevail. l'll certainly try to uphold the
positives ofthis title and you can too.

l’ll miss this place and all oiyou.These last
four years have taught me so much about my
self, sexually and intellectually and eniOl’lon’
ally and socially. Now I figure it's time to go
out into the world and work to find out who
others are. So go forth,brave Grinnellians, and
embrace the slut, spreading your love and joy
and selfeaffirmation—but don't spread any-
thing else, A good slut uses protection.

Grinnell needs to regain its progressivism

At admitted graduate students’ day at the
University or Chicago, 1 had a chance ens
counter with William Sewell Jr., one of the
nation’s most eminent political historians.
Scwcll is also the son ofa fabled University of
Wisconsin president and sociology professor,
William Sewell Sr., who, among other things,
was known for his leadership in increasing
the accessibility of
higher education
to underprivileged
demographics.

While we concur-
rently discussed
graduate school
and his father’s ac-
ademic activism, the younger Sewell made an
important, albeit cliched, point, It is one with
which I still have difficulty coming to terms*
that the liberal education is immeasurably
valuable because it enables us to engage in our
communities, perhaps even change them, via
a heightened adroitness at a vague skill called
“critical thinking. "

I often have no clue what I’m doing here at
Grinnell, or why l'm going to graduate school
next year. While 1 pondered these questions,l
found it helpful to go to the faculty event a few
weeks ago, where three very talented profes-
sors discussed hiring and firing at the College.
Though this is the lastcoluinn that I'll publish
at Grinnell and I don’t want to end on it critical
tone,I can't help but note the relationship be
tween academic life and activism on campus.
something these professors helped to clarify,

we would be wasting our education, our
money and our time ifwe didn't stop and clues
tion our administration from tiinc to time,
While I wish President Osgood well in his
retirement, 1 am not surprised to see him go,
I agree with David White’s assessment of 05*
good's “collegial style," and I'm sure he’ll make
a good teachei in the ensuing years. But as we
begin our search fora new president. it's in
portant for us to praise and acknowledge what
Osgood has contributed (I’osse Foundation,
Prison Program, Expnndcd Knowledge lmtia-
tivc) while learning from his shortcomings,

Osgood reminds me or the now laidsofr
GM, chief Rick Wagoncnwho promoted gass
guzzling llummeis and tossed the electric car
even as climate change began to plague our
environment. Likewise, Osgood has run our
school like an irresponsible corporate execus
tive, with the simplistic goals of making more

money, building huge buildings, and pocket—
ing big paychecks. His mistakes are as spells
binding as Wagoner's.ln addition to the aforcs
mentioned achievements, Osgood ignored the
potential advantages ofwind energy and pre»
sided over a misguiided admission staff, which,
while making no progress in diversifying our
community during the Osgood Decade, boasts
as its sole accomplish—
ment the creation of

“No Limits.”
We need to keep
in mind thnt we are
a college that em,
phasizes social his
use, which by defis
nition entails treating people fairly, But the
administiation, at least in the last few years,
has acquired a McCartliysstyle power fetish.
As an SGA Senator last spriiig.I remember
the day Osgood appeared before Joint Board
to introduce his new Student Affairs admin-
istrator, the one and only Houston Daugharty.
Together, this dynamic duo spoke ofways to
improve student life and
foster a more nourishing

in an inane propaganda

stunt, Dough“, in“ question ouradmlnl’slmtlon from time to time.

showed up to a Harris
party to convey his interest in campus 1ife.Of
course, Dougharty has since gone on to engen-
der unthinkable tensions and, in the process,
reveal an obscene lack ofethicnl standards.

A member OfJOIiH Board also asked Os~
good when he would retire. Isle stated that he
would leave soon, but only iftlie College was
in decent shape and if things were in order.
In a Pinteicstpic twist of logic, Osgood now
leaves Grinncll after losing a billion dollars of
endowment money and helping to incite the
most tumultuous faculty uproar in decades.

Though I do admire President Osgood's
many positive attributes,l strongly believe that
be, along with his dream team of Dougharty
and company, are no role models for under
graduates. Osgood's worst crime not miss
managing our school but failing to adhere to
the principles of the liberal arts. Rather than
thinking critically, Osgood conformed to the
diseased culture or corporire greed that has
infected most other elite colleges. Like Wag-
oner, he should have questioned the hedonism
ofthe times and upheld Grinncll's piogrcssivc
heritage. And like Wagonei, he’s encounteiing

We wou/d be warring our edutallon, our
andmngmviwnment money, and our time if we didn’t stop and

the same destiny

It’s important for us to identify real role
models in the liberal arts worldA—pcople who
utilize their education to question the status
quo and improve their communities, like the
professors at the aforementioned event—peo-
ple like William Sewell So, who successfully
clitiqued the unchecked practices ofunivetsr
ties and consequently made them more condut
cive to students from needy backgrounds,

our new president should keep in mind
the best interests ofall ofour current students,
while simultaneously recruiting prospective
students who likely wouldn't othciwise attend
Grinnell. She should work to create a student
body that's both visually and non-visually di-
verse. She should institute a practice foi grape
pling with hate crimes and discrimination. She
should strike a balance between “institutional
longevity" and our Mission Statement, which
calls for “serving the common good." She
should be a role model for all Grinnellians.

As I careen into graduate school, remarks
ably clueless, l constantly find myself reflects
ing on time spent
with those heroes of
Grinncll, the sorts of
people 1 would like
to one day become.
These include my
friend and mentor Victoria Brown, History,
whose dedication to her students is unparalt
lclcd. Others are Pablo Silva, History, Sarah
Purcell, History, Paul l-lutehison. Education,
Tammy Nyden, Philosophy, Ed Colin, History,
Rob Lewis, History. Liz Prevost, History, and
many more. I also feel an intense kinship to the
many close friends I have on campus, particu-
larly my most intimate friend,Will Flagle '09,
who, simply put, is horh the smartest and the
nicest person I've ever met.

These people, through their activism, dedis
cation to teaching and scholarship, and come
passion and personal integrity, epitomize the
very best things that a liberal arts college has
to offer. And as we begin the search for a new
president, let's make the interests or our stu-
dents arid our faculty the focus ofthat search.

As I've done this year, I intend to continue
critically examining the events taking place on
campus and offeiing my advice or expertise if
I have any, because Grinnell hits been the best
experience, academically and socially, of my
life, and I'd like it to stay that way for generas
tions to come.
