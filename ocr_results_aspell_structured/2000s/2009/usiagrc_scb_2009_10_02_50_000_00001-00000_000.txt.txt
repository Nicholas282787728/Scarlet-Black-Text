Hate Crime Response Policy reviewed

BVSOLOMON MILLER

Many students were confused by what up
peared to be a live day limit placed on student
feedback on the recently released hate crime re-
sponse policy. This is only the latest mlscommus
nication in a year—and-a-half long process that
cremains elatively ambiguous.

The ﬁrst public draft of the Hate Crimes/
Bias Motivated Incidents Protocol Draft, come
monly referred to as the Hate crime Response
Policy, or HCRP, was published online last
week The Latest push to create such a document
is a response to the hate crimes that occurred
during the Spring of2008.

only nowﬂ year and a half laterihas the
HCRP been released. Many students and stu—
dent groups, including the No Limits Project
(NLP), which included the policy of framing
HCRP m their demands last spring, are upset
with the delays and obscurity associated with the
creation process.

Latona Giwa ’09, a member of No Limits,
said she was unsettled by how long and com»
plicated the process has been. She said she was
upset, citing that no work was done to write the
HCRP until 2009, almost a year after the hate
crimes of '08.“No one claimed responsibility for
writing the document," Giwa said.

NLP ms also troubled by the lack of trans-
parency throughout the creation of the HCRP.
Joe Hiller'12, also of NLP wants to “ensure the
campus is well informed of every step of [the]
process."

Most recently, a miscommunication oer
curred when Vice President of Diversity and
Achievement, Elena Bernal, who has been over-
seeing the document since August of this year,
sent out a campus-wide e-mail that informed
the student body of the release of the document
and the ﬁve day period that students had to pro
vide initial feedback on the document. Though
she intended this timeframe for the discussion
ofﬂrst impressions, and said she plans to further
promote means of student input in the coming
months, the wording of her first e-mail “m5 mis-
leading.

“Yout comments or feedback should be sent
directly to diversity@grinnell.edu no later than
Monday, Sept. 28," Bernal wrote in the e—mail.
"These will be rncorpomted, as appropriate, into
a iinal protocol which will be shared broadly in
its ﬁnal form as soon as possible thereafter."

At the end of the ﬁve day deadline, she sent
a follow up e-mail to clarify that she is still in
the process of accepting student feedback and
editing the document. The second e-mail stared
that “no comment will be excluded due to any
timeframe.”

While fears oftbe student voice being aliens
ated seem to have abided, the lack of consistency
troubled some students “Students were natural-
ly concerned.” Hiller said. “There “m5 no mene
tion ofa living document in the first esmail."

Bernal says that she has always had every in—
tention of being open to students and working
with students to create the HCRP.“My door is

open whenever anybody wants to see me,” Ber»
rial said. She reported that, outside of SGA reps
resentatives, no students requested to meet with
her about the document as of Wednesday, Sept.
30.

According to Giwa, the student body was
not informed that Bemal was in charge of the
document. “I‘m sure she's open to students, but
no one knew she had [the document]," Giwa
said.

Betnal, the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs, and
NLP all expressed a desire to move forward and
work together to improve the HCRP. Express
ing a sentiment echoed by Greene, Bemal said,
“I intend to be completely open to whatever
critical feedback comes of this.”

Giwa paralleled this attitude, and said, “I see
no reason why we can't work together."

NLP has some concern that there is no for-
mal process for organizing student input going
forth. one idea proposed by Hiller, which he
said was independent of his role in NLP, in-
volves a committee made up of students elected
for this purpose that would work with the ad~
ministration to oversee and promote awareness
of the HCRP and student input.

Bernal said she has not yet set up a formal
means of collecting feedback, but she has, with
student help, begun organizing educational fo-
rums about hate crimes and open discussions.
She is also leaving open the email account set
up, diversity@grinnell.edu.

Information
Center opens

BY MATTHEW BACHTELL

on Wednesday, Sept. 30, Grinnell’s Sexual
Health Information Center (SHIC) opened
their doors for the first time, The SHIC, a
studentsrun organization created to promote
awareness of and educate Grinneli students
about sexual health. held its first open house.
Just under 100 people ﬁlteled in and out ofthc
ncwlyeopcncd center, located in the Multicule
tuial Suites of the 2nd floor of the Joe Rosens
field Center.

Rebecca Bernstein ’10, a member of the
Domestic Violence Alternatives/Sexual A57
sault Center (DVA/SAC), founded the center
after hearing students from Oberlin college
discuss their school’s Sexual Information Cens
ter while she was abroad. After listening to
students from all over the United States while
abroad in London, Bernstein learned that
Grinnell was one of the few colleges without
an organized sexual health program.

“There were only a few schools that had
established centers, but all of them had some
sort of program for STI testing, HIV test-
ing, peer education—something like that, and
Grinnell had ilothing,"Bernstein said.

“Part ofour mission is to distingiish sexual
health from Sexual orientation and sexual as
sault so that people don’t unintentionally link
them together,"Bernstein said, referring to the
fact that DVA/SAC and Stonewall Resource

SEG achieves
nonprofit status

BY LIANA ElSMAN

The Student Entrepreneurs of Grinnell
(SEG) recentlyjoined the same ranks of or—
ganizations such as Amnesty and the Hu-
man Rights Watch as an ofﬁcial NoneGoVe
ernmental Organization (NGO). Making
history at Grinnell college, SEG became
the ﬁrst organization to receive the natione
ally accredited 501c(3) status in September
of 2009.

SEC collects money from the entire
Grinnell College community, and then dis-
tributes noeinterest loans to fund various
projects all over the world.

These funds are allocated to third party
companies that distribute interest free loans
to people abroad who have limited or no
access to stable banking systems, as well as
individuals Grinnellians met abroad. SEG
gives out loans to projects such as the den
velopmenr ofa farm, the installment of new
technology, or to pay for an education, SEG
does not impose interest fees on these loans.

As these loans are paid back, the money
is recntered into SEG’s funds and in turn can
be used to support others in need. secs roe
newable structure was the result of intense
education on microfinance. “We tried to
educate ourselves, we have gone into classes
in the past, we have done a bit of comrnue
nity outreach, and have just tried to teach
ourselves about microfinance.” Mark Root-
