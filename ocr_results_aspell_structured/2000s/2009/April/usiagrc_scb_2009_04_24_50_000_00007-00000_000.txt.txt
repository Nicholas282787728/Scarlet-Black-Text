WhyisTitular Head calledTitular Head?

Sullivan: Apparently Relays and Titular Head used to be
linked together [in the 19705]. I think Titulat Head was the last
evmt the winner of relays would be called the ”Titular Head"
and would lead this match to Harris.'I'hen they would have a skit
show I'm sure some of them were just made up on the spot
because people were wasted.

Rathjen: Originally there was a talent show in the '70s and
'80s I think the winner of the talent show was the Titular Head
and they got to sit on a ﬂoat. Then Relays died out and a couple
years later some students brought back the ﬁlm fest part ofitThe
name just kind ofrrugratod on, but was by and large divorced from
its original meaning

How is the host selected?

Ward: I think they just pick someone that could handle a
crowd and that they think is funny. Apparently they also pick
someone that can project because I didn’t have a microphone for
the fust half of Tit Head.

Neely: [This year's host] Rachel Fields ['09] is hilarious and
she knows how to play a crowd well. Mark and I thought she'd
be a good candidate. he nicc to givc a scnior the host posltlorii
kinda fun to go out in a bang.

How is the panel ofjudges selected?
Sulli\mll:Ti'adiI:ionallyit's been SGA cabinet, [both] incoming
and outgoing, and then we have tour students at large. so this year
we have Fonz Jenkins [10,] and Kat York [’09,] [who] has never
gone [to Titular Head] and then Erik Simpson [English] and

Doug cutchins Simpson was apparently a judge lus ﬁrst year,
loved it, and was never invited back.

Bauman: I think maybe its because that I’m pretty opcn
minded to the whole dung. I don’t think its because of my movie
knowledge at all

When and/or why is there a tradition of being raucously
dninlt forTitnlzr Head?

Sullivan: 1 think it just has to be that way. When I describe
it to people I like to say that it’s like a Roman amphitheatre. It’s
deﬁnitely not a ﬁlm festival.

Ward: Unless someone was submitting something they really
thought ms their magnum opus and sulrered psychological traur
ma tiom the heckling it received I don't think there's anything
wrong with it. it added to the atmosphere and the notoriety

What makes a ﬁlm successﬁd/unsuocessﬁll?

Neely. 1 think really good ﬁlms incorporate a lot of Mermt
people on campus and incorporate a quirk about us. I reallylike the
fact that' it’s a Celebration of Odd—mes in our weird eccentric com-
munity. Its like we know that we ’re being a bundi ofdorks and we
know that [we're] geeking out over kind of silly smﬁ‘.

Ward: Brevity is essential. I think that featuring prominent
Grinnell traditions or landmarks or people or characters are all es
sential to a successﬁll filml think a ﬁlm that takes imelf seriously
at all is bound to fail. or one that’s long. Or boring. Or cliche.

What is your favoriteTitular Head ﬁlm?

Sullivan: I’m going to go old school hercl rcally like “Handjub
atHchc." lt's rcallyold,1 think [from] 1993. It’sjustnguyeating
a cream ﬁlled doughnut at HyVec and there are cuts to carrots and
people's ﬁngers touching carrots and the product: aisle at l-lyvee
and he ﬁnishes it and Licks his ﬁngers 03‘ and that’s the end of the
movie.

Neely: One that really captures a more recent Gnnnell attitude
is “Bare Aspiration," the one about a sneaker. But interestingly
enough the main character in that ﬁlm didn’t even go to Grinucll.

Bauman: Racquetball [Tunak Tuuak Tun] was pmrty good.
That's going to bc around for many ycars.

technology has inﬂuencedTitulnr Head?

Neely: In generall think YouTube has geared people toward
what is funny in ﬁlm. It's increasing expectations and also increas-
ing quality.

Ward: I worry that it will inﬂuence ﬁlms to their detriment if
somebody gen it in their head that it’d be funny to imitate some
YouTube ﬁlm that’ll be long gone and forgotten in a couple of
months I have more faith in the intelligence of Grinneil stu»
dents.

Rath'en: The switchover to digital ms while I was [at
Grinnelll so the production value just skyrocketed. lt lowers the
ban-ier for enIry so if you have an idea, it’s easier to get it on screen.

What, ifanything, would you change about Tituhr Head.
or where do you see it goingintlre future?

Sullivan: rm worried about Tit Head becoming too inslimr
donaljzed and rational in terms of the way the committee is run.
[This is] the ﬁrst year we have an email account, which is great,
but half of me reels likc,Titular Head doesn’t need an email ac-
count. I kind oflike that it's this inbred, weird, completely nepo»
tistic scructurs.And it’s like alot ofpeople dodt understand how it
works and I like that. I like that its not democratic. Fuck that shit.

Ward: 1 dont know in would change anything 1 never saw
any ﬂaws.

What is your advice to futureTitulnr Head ﬁlmmakers?
Sullivan: 1 like Kellogg’s Com Flakes because ifthe audience
ears enough ofthem and gets drunk enough they will throw them
up in the Harris bathroom and ﬁlmmakers will hopefully ﬁlm
it for a ﬁlm next year.

Ward: Be ambitious and don’t make a ﬁlm Illat’s easy to make
or that anyone can makc.And try and bi: ﬁinny, just for your sake.
It’ll save any ﬁlm.

Rathjcm so many people have ideas you hear a hundred
great ideas that could result in a hundred great ﬁlms and people
just never get around to doing it. My advice would be. make that
ﬁlm.

Bauman: Hire it out. Get Steven Spielberg to do it. No, cry to
be on the lighter side. relax, have a good time doing it. Don't try
to get real serious. Let the movie have a lighter side and not such
a dark side,
