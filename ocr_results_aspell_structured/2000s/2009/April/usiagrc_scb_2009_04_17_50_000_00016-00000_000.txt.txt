We ull know that there are plenty of
alternative energy sources to fossil fuels,
most of which have not been tapped to
their full potential. One that has certainly
not been exploited enough is dancing.

Daneing consumes a lot of energy
when you ﬂing yourself around at Harris,
but it can also produce some energy A
company called Sustainable Dance Club
is leading the way on harnessing all that
energy through its chain dance clubs. The
movement on the ﬂoor created by danc-
ing is converted into electricity. By sim-
ply having tun, you can create five to 20
watts of energy, equal to the energy neccs»
sary to power a compact ﬂuorescent bulb
to. a night (depending on your iitdiyiduul
weight and activity level).

The ﬂooi, Ciciitcd out of LED lights
and iceycled materials, is comprised of
modules that move vertically us they are
pushed on by the dancers-'moyemenr. This
\Iprandrdown motion generates electric
ity. To create even more energy, the core
poration sets up a screen rhar shows the
hmount of power generated, encouraging
people to dance more “energetically."

To join the franchise, a club must come
ply with a series of sustainable regulations.
It must have a 30 percent less environmen-
ml impact than an “average" club, and in-

We saw you, signing your mime to the phys-

possible and smirking as you bypassed the unsus~

We did not, however, see you at physics table
itself. If you don’t want to ear with us. please
don’t eat an out dime (or 80 dimes, to be exact).

See you next Thursday (And if we don't,
expect a bill in your campus mailbox to follow
shortly)

you cun prove yourself to be interested and/or
proﬁcient in physics.

Attempts to do so or apologies for your be-
havior should be delivered to the physics com-
mons.

Biased photograph in 5&8

The photograph on the cover of last week‘s
5&3 unfairly and inaccurately depicts the No
Limits members atJoint Board as aggressive and
noi‘rcoopel‘ativc. I substituted for a senator that
night and remember the exchange between Jeff
Sinick and the presenters as (mi: of the tensest
moments of the meeting. By visually apptoxi-
mating Jerf's point of view, the training or the
photo uph nutkes identification with his visual
perspective seem natural, while the No Limits
presenters are spatially alienated and seem un~
relatable. The photographer, Aaron Barker, took
many pictures that night and I find it unfortunate
that the editors did not choose a less biased ex
ample for their readers

Urine in the Burling elevator

To the unidentiﬁed person who urinatecl in the
Burljng elevator on Monday night . . . as well as
others who may huvc been in the elevator after that,
but failed to come to the circulation desk to inform
us or the situation , _ i chunks so very, very rnuch.
With all the discussions about sclfsgm‘cmancc and
increased police presence on campus,l fail to have
any sympitthy for you. If you Can’t self-govern your
bladder, why should I think you could sulfrgovem
anything else in your life? Face facts , . .ifyou are
going to act like «juvenile, be prepared to be treated
as one.
