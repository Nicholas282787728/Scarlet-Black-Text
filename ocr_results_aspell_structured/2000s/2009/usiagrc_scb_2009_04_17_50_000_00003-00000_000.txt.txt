upon the hiring process for
the Dean of Srudenrs posi-
tion currently occupied by Greene Greene and
Dougharty share a long professional history
dating back ten years to when Greene met then-
iowa State university Associate Dean Doughr
arty as he interviewed for graduate school there.
The following year Greene took an inreinship
at University of Puget Sound, where Doughr
arty was serving an Associate Dean, and in
2007 Greene completed a docroral internship
ar Lewis at Clark under Dougharty.

The faculty document questioned whether
or not Dougharty, who was involved in part in
Greene's hiring, should have participated in the
process at all and whether the decision to hire
Greene constituted nepotism, Greene was one
ofthree finalists for the Dean ofStudents posir
tion One of the finalists was disqualified for
falsifying his educational history. The other, an
associate dean at Colgate University, had more
formal experience than Greene, as he had al-
ready served as dean according to his resume.

A search committee composed of students,
faculty and staffselected a small group ofean-
didates from the pool of applicants for phone
interviews. From that group, three are generally
chosen for an onrcampus interview. Dough-
arty,who chaired the search committee, recused
himself during the phone interviews of candir
dates he knew, which included Greene, but was
active during the final selection. Some faculty
viewed his role in these stages as inappropriate,

Nevertheless, members of the committee
interviewed by the 5&3 said that the process
was appropriate and transparent and that there
was no indication offoul play.

“It was first ofall made very clear. Any cane
didate whose information we looked at, if there
was anyone on the committee who had a prior
relationship with them, that was known," said
i<atie McMullen '09, a student representative
on the committee.

“Travis was not the only candidate who
had a previous relationship with members or
the committee, and Houston was not the only
member of the committee who had relations
ships with candidates, [It] was very open and
honest Within the committee—that was made
very clear to us what those relationships were,
and then in the initial stages of the process,
people did recuse themselves,"Mc1vlullen said,

Members also said that while the ﬁnalist
from Colgate had more cxpcticnc: than Greene,
they were skeptical of his ability to relate to
Grinnell students and mesh with the College's
culture, “He just demonstrated a clear inability
to relate to students on a mental level. He just
was not it good ﬁt for Gtinnell," said SGA Vice
President for Student Affairs John Burrows '10,
who served on the committee. “Where we see
administrators [at Grinnell] as being accessible,
we did not sec him as being accessible at all. [He
was] very cold, very impetsonable."

Director ofsafety and Security Steven Bris-
coe, who was a member of the committee, said
he felt the search was transparent, "As a com,
mittee he threw it open to everybody . he
didn't try to move us one way or another,” Brisr
we said. “The decision was made in that com-
mittee and ir was very, very open."

Greene also sought to allay similar concerns
that some had been raised about the hiring of
Andrea Conner for the Assistant Dean position
as Conner and Greene were in the same Mass
ter’s program at the University of Iowa from
1999 to 2001.

Greene refuted claims that his relationship
to Conner played any role in rhe deci on to hire
her or that the process was in anyway inappro—
priate. “Because we had that connection I res
cused myselffrorn [Conner's] phone interview
and I Was very upfront with the search commit-
tee and you can verify that with any of the
snidents who were on the search committee
and they can tell you about that upfront too,”
Greene said. “Did I personally target Andrea or

anyone else who applied for a posrtion? No,"

Faculty Grievances and External Review:

One ofthe major demands put forth by the
group of concerned faculty has been a request
for a full external review of the hiring and fit-
mg practices of thc Student Affairs departs
ment. At the meeting on Feb 4 during which
the faculty document vms initially distributed,
52 of 67 professors voted that there should be
an external review of hiring and firing in the
department of Student Affairs.

“[That vote] says that faculty were suffrr
cienrly concerned about what they were hear»
ing, not only about Sheree Andrews’ firing, but
about how luring goes on in Student Affairs,
that they wanted a look at it," said Victoria
Brown, History, one of the professors who
helped prepare the document.

In further meetings between Osgood and
faculty, a decision to conduct an external review
was reached, although there has been contcnr
tion over the way it will be conducted.

Rather than focusing on Student Affairs,
the review will examine hiring and firing prac-
tices for all areas ofstafl‘ing in the College. And
while the faculty have pushed for the review to
be conducted prior to the end of the current
semester, the review might not take place durr
ing that time frame.

“Wt: would like to conduct the review be—
fore the end of the semester but it’s difﬁcult
with people's schedules," said Vice President
for Institutional Planning and Associate Dean
Marci Sortor, who will be assembling the em
ternal review. “So when we talk to people who
might be good outside reviewers, most ofthem
say ‘wow, I can give you some time in June.’
And we want to do this while students are
on campus so that if students want to have a
say they can have a say. So if we are not able
to identify outside reviewers and get them on
campus in a timely way this spring, we‘re likely
to go ahead and wait until early fall."

Some ofthe faculty who pushed {or review

expressed concern that the wide net cast by
the invesrigation will not allow for a thorough
examination of their complaints over Student
Affairs. “The problem with the allrunit outside
review is you’re going to bring in outside tee
viewers and they're going to have a lot of pot)»
pie to talk to, so concerns about Student Affairs
can get diluted,“ Brown said. “In th spirit of
cooperation, we have agreed to part pate in
this outside review insofar as we will particir
pate in the planning of how the review is going
to be conducted."

Aside from the external review, faculty
grievances include unresolved allegations of
snident harassment. ln a Feb 14 all-campus e»
mail, rhe Board ofTrustecs condemned alleged
ﬁtculty harassment of students. Faculty mem,
bers interviewed expressed concern that they
were castigated without investigation,

“So the charge is out there uninvestigatcd
by our group of 13. [We] polled every member
of our group to say ‘have you been hauhng kids
into your office and browrbeating them' and
we could come up with no evidence to support
such charges,” Brown said. “The president has
decline to investigate the charges and therefore
declined to make any clarifying statement."

When asked about the investigation, Osr
good responded that such allegations were
never substantiated. “I received some informa—
tion and I talked to some people, and the rest
is conﬁdential. But I did not see information
that lead me to believe that [evidence of stu—
dent harassment] was absolutely clear," Osgood
said. “I talked to several people and it was my
conclusion that there was insufﬁcient evidence
to go forwar

Even with insufficient evidence, faculty ex-
pecred Osgood to comment on the indictment.
“The president is not responsible for the Tmslc
ces'lettcr and we do not hold him responsible
for the Trustees’ letter," Brown said. “But we
were trying to get him to make his own inde-
