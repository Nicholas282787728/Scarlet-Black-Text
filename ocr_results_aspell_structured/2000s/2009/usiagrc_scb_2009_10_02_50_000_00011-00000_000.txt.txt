What does the existence of the “gay gene” mean?

Dean Hamer’s presentation on the ”gay gene” raises questions about the ethics of defining sexual orientation

Lastweek, I was excited that Dr. Dean Hamer, a nations
ally renowned scientist, was coming to Grinnell to give a
talk about the “gay gene."1 particularly found it personally
convenient that someone could validate my identity by seir
entiiically proving that “gay people" do not “choose" their
sexual orientation, but
are born with a sexual
desire toward samc'sex
sexual partners. In fact
it was more than cons
venient, it was an ops
portunity to reinforce
the argument that I
had been debating for
two consecutive days
with my friend about whether being queer was involuntary
or was it a matter of free will.

But Dr. Hamer’s malecoriented studies and repetitive
words did not help my argument at all. In fact, the implicar
tions ofhis “discovery" sent me back to a time when women
were accused of being witches and hunted down like wild
animals. He explained that it is difficult to pin down one
particular gene that could determine sexual orientation in
a male because there are multiple factors that inﬂuence
whether a gene is directly linked to another gene or if it
is activated. However, he was sure about one thing: the X—
chromosome carried the ‘gay gene' in his male participants.

Read that last sentence again. I did not register the-

magnitude of what that statement implied until I heard
it the second time] sat in that room doubting my hear-
ing, but there it was again: the discovery of “A Linkage
between DNA Markers on the X-chromosome and Male
Sexual Orientation" (this is actually the title of one of his
published works). Males inherit their chhromosome copy
from their biological mothers, right? So does that mean
that the biological mothers of his participants passed the

"gay gene” to them? I did not know how to react to such a
conclusion, other than remembering the disclaimer on the
TV show “cops": “all suspects are innocent until proven
guilty in a court oflaw."

But women in my family are already guilty in the court
of men whose ma-
chismo makes up our
patriarchal society. I
have even heard men
describe women as if
they were infected with
the contagious virus
of destruction. In my
traditional machista
family, as well in many
others, men believe that women are responsible for “turn—
ing" their children gay or lesbian with their
excessive expressions oflovc or liberal femlr
nist thoughts. In religion, women have been
condemned since the beginning of times as
the “sin instigator," which is represented in
the biblical figure ovae. In history, women
have been pronounced guilty of producing
daughters instead of sons, but scientists
have proven that in fact it is the male's Y
chromosome that determines the biological
sex ofa child.

So is Dr. Hamer’s scientiﬁc “discovery"
going to reinforce the notion that mothers
not only “nurture” their sons_ to be gay but
are also biologically guilty of having gay
male children? How will my patriarchal,
perhaps antiquated society, use this piece
of information? Will we then move from
the “sick gay" to the “sick mother," who is spreading the
“disease" of gayness? Will society discriminate against “inc

thoughts.

LETTERS
TO THE EDITOR

A discourse on the quality of The Scarlet & Black

In my traditional mathisia
family, as well at in many
others, men believe that
worhen are responsible
for ”turning” their children
gay or lesbian with their
excessive expression: of
love or liberal feminist

fected women," thus creating another subcategory under
“woman"? Will patriarchal societies like the one my fame
ily comes from have new views on abortion? Or will it try
monitor the number of children that “infected women" can
have if any? or will society panic and place all “infected
women" in “relocation camps" like they did to Japanese
families during World War II?

What do the government, scientists or our own biologi-
cal characteristics, for that matter, have to do with deter
mining our identities? Ifsomeone selfcidentiﬁes as gay, but
does not have the “gay gene" can they still identify as gay?
Or will society perceive them as wannabes? What about
people who do not self»identify as gay and their “gay gene"
is activated by environment, as Dr. Hamer suggested? Will -
they be forced to take on a gay identity just because we
have determined that a gene makes up our sexual oriene

ration? There are cases of people who are
raced white, but who self»identify as Afri-
can Americans. so why do we have to limit
identity to our genetic makeup?

At the end of Dean Hamer’s talk,I was
searching for reasons why I might want a
doctor to validate and determine my sexual
orientationjust like they determined my his
ological sexihaving a list of biological and
social standards to justify my queer identity
would vastly simplify my life. However, the
reality is that sexual orientation cannot be
explained with a recipe. In this same way,
sexual orientation cannot be narrowed down
to a gene that Dr. Hamer claims is carried
in the chhromosome. Rather, it's a puzzle
that cannot be solved by fitting pieces to-
gether since society has not determined ev-
ery factor that might make up sexual orientation~if, in
fact, those factors exist.

A complaint about the 5&8

To Whom It May Concern,

I have just ﬁnished reading this weeks edir
non of the SE53, and I have to say that I am
absolutely appalled at the quality of much of
its writing. Unfortunately, dais is not the ﬁrst
time the paper has left me thinking “Does
anybody bother to read this thing before it
goes to print?”. The quality of our newspaper
has been declining lately, and after reading this
week‘s paper, I simply cannot stand idle any
more. .

This rant isn’t aimed at any one person in
particular, but rather at the .388 as a whole.
Grinnell college has a reputation for produc-
ing people who know how to write and who
know how to write well. Even a cursory glance
at our newspaper, however, leaves a lot to be
desired. After reading the two cover stories
this week (both of which contained numerous
errors, some obvious and some not so obvi-
ous),I decided to take out my red pen and go
through the whole paper. I only got halfrway
through before I was disgusted enough that I
had to write this letter.

We call IIIEIII

“IGIIIIIIII‘S.
Write a loner!» mo editor

, The 5ch employs thirteen people with
the title of editor. I understand that thejobs of
the editors vary greatly and that no one person
is responsible for editing the whole paper, but
this week's edition seriously left me wonder
ing if any of the so-called editors are editing
anything at all! Even so, all the blame cannot
be placed upon the editors; it has to be shared
with the staﬂ‘ writers as well. I know there isn‘t
a soul on this campus who doesn't proof-read,
tweak, and oh my gosh, edit what they write
for class before they turn it in. Shouldn't the
work you all do for the scars be given the same
attention?

I want a college newspaper that I can be
proud of. Right now, the SSH leaves me shalt-
ing my head. Quite frankly, it reflects poorly
on the college and on our wellcknown reputac
tion for producing good writers.

iAlex Whit: ’12

Editor‘s response: First, thank you for
writing in.We always appreciate it when read-
ers express their opinions, whether they are
complementary or contradictory to our own.

That the $88 is inadequate is an age-old

complaintihere we refer you to “This Week
in Grinnell History" on the back page. There
is almys criticism directed towards the staff of
this smdentcmn paper, and, given the problems
you cite in your letter, your criticism is absov
lutely understandable.

For a newspaper that employs 13 students
with the title of editor, it is certainly frustrating
to be seemingly inundated with errors. That
being said, this is an extracurricular activity
that often requires more time than a staff of
hill—nine students can reasonably lend. Your
statement that we do not “proof-read, tweak,
and, oh my gosh, edit” is both inaccurate and
offensive in tone.

The writers and editors of the S638 put
many hours ofwork into each week's newspaper,
and yet, like most pieces written on this came
pus, our work is still often ﬂawed. Yes, Grinnell
is a school that is known for producing good
writers, but it is worth noting that many of our
writers are students who have been at Grinnell
for a grand total of five weeks. As editors, one
of the most important aspects of our job is to
foster and support those inexperiencedjoumalc
ists in becoming better, more conﬁdent writers

That aspect of our job, compounded with
all our other weekly responsibilities, makes
the ﬁrst few editions of each year's paper a bit
more prone to errors than is generally acceptr
able.

But instead of starting a new student pa
per to protest the SHE’s perceived inadequacy,
as was done in 1980, or taking red pens to
newspapers that have already been published,
we invite people to lend a helping hand. You
seem to have a penchant for copy-editing, so
we encourage you to come in to the ofﬁce next
week and help out:
