The best art ever?

Every artist wants people who view their
work to feel connected to it in some way.
There's no denying it, really Whether this
connection is negative or positive is irrelevant.

But what do people like to see in art—
spccifically in painting? What constitutes
good painting to the aveiage pcison? What
does it mean when artists begin to cater to
these needs, and how do artists ﬁgure out what
people want from art?

The answer? Polls.

Fifteen years ago, Russian artists Vitaly
Komar and Alex Melainid embarked on “The
People's Choice Project" to discover what peo-
ple want to see when they look at art thiough
polls mirroiing those in politics. Komar and

Melamid then produced a series of paintings
for 14 different nations.

The paintings are, frankly, timelessly bore
ing. Think I'm being snobby? Check them

The website features paintings from coun-
tries all around the world. With a simple click
of the inorise, you can look at the “most want-
ed” paintings and the “least'xvanted” pa tr
ings from each country polled. The que ns
range from how much money people believe
should be spent on art to what genres they like
to see. ~

All ofthc most wanted paintings are renlr

. istically rendered landscapes, except for Hol-
land, whose painting is smaller, featuring an
abstract blending of colors with no discrimi—
nate shapes. Amongst the landscapes, most of
the ideal paintings have a tree on the left side,
a big skyline and some sort ofwildlife and a
human figure,

In a summary of the survey, Americans
preferred "traditional styles over more modern
designs; they also express a strong preference
for paintings that depict landscapes or similar
outdoor scenes”. More specifically, Americans
opted for a lake scene,wirh billowing clouds in
the background, deer at the edge of the water,
children in the right foreground and (hilarir
nusly) George Washington in the midrright
section of the painting. Apparently historical
figures were deemed a major component or
“good" or “wanted" art.

So where is the Wine in this Koinar and
Mclainid’s exerctse? Why do they do what
they do what we want them to do? Nothing
is sacred in this postmodern world ofours and
they as artists, perhaps ironically, would be the
ﬁrst to admit it.

In an interview with The Nflliim, Alex
Melamid said, “Artists now—I cannot speak
for all, but I have talked to many artists who
feel this wayiwe have lost even our belief that
we are the minority which knows. We beheved
10 years ago, 20 years ago, that we knew the
secret. Now we have lost this belief We are a
minority with no power and no belief, no faith.
I feel myself, as an artist and as a citizen, just
totally obsolete. I don‘t know why I am here,
what i am doing

If art has lost its meaning and the art
that is “most wanted” features deer. children
and dead presidents what are we to do? Is
the only thing left to become a slave to the
polls? Perhaps the most interesting aspect of
Komat and Melamid's work is the fact that the
audience has become complicit in creating the
art.

If the audience (or poll takers) controls
the artist, then how can we define the new
function of the artist? In creating these paintr
ings, the artists stultify both what art culture
has become and the culture that informs the
aesthetic sensibilities of the audience. Mind-
blowing and original, Komar and Melamid’s
ideas deserve our consideration and respect.

Wright’s long road from the page to the stage

BVJAMES ANTHOFER

At around 6 p.m.6n aTuesday night at the
Wall in Bucksbaum Greg Hudson ‘09 reads his
lines during the auditions for Jaysen Wrights
'09 [liteerpﬂrt play suite Ties 1/2/11 Biol! (Hudr
son eventually got the part). His character is
talking about gays in America, and the mono-
logue, already prickling with tension, begins
to pick up steam. “San Francisco is a refugee
camp for homosexuals,” Hudson says. "We
have formed a ghetto out of self—protection. It
is a ghetto rather than a frec teiiitory because
it is theirs."

“I really liked that snarky. sort of cynical
tone,”Wright says. Along with fellow director
Caitlin Davies '09,Wright has been watching
hopeful actors and actresses at the Wall for two
hours already, and he and Davies face another
two hours there tomorrow. But this audition
process represents only a tiny pint of the mas-
sive endeavor Wright began nearly a year ago
that culminates with the premiere, shown as
part of an April zsrzo show featuring works
from both dance and theatre.

But concrete, measurable steps in the ev0r
lution ofWright's project somehow don’t add
up to all the things it is, has been, and will
beia part of one of only four main—stage the-
atre productions that happen every year (a first
for a student playwright), an attempt to make
sense of a movement and a disease, a remark
able example of collaboration, and perhaps
most impressively, a piece otintenscly personal
art.

Each play in Ties that Bind cycles, returns,
looks back, and looks to the future in three
plays, eaeh between 10 and is minutes. They
focus on such diverse subjects as the politics of
homosexuality in society (“Voices in Time"),
the effects of HIV on friends and family
("Summer Quartet"), and why gay men would
stay together if one of them is HIV positive
(Looking Back). It alternates between atmo-
spheric and realistie,joyous and tragic, chaotic
and structured.

The concept behind the plays emerged last
spring, when Elizabeth Bonjean, former pro-
fessor otThcatre, led Wright in guided read-

ings of important plays around the issues of
homosexuality. Through the project, Wright
began to get a sense of his personal style of
writing from plays Like Tony ltushnerb Angels
in America. Larry Kramer’s A Normal Hmrr,
and Matt Crowley's Buy: it! fbr Band. transr
lating his appreciation for these works into
something tangible. “I wanted to write in a
way to essentialize the stories I was reading,"
said wright.

His first efforts toward production began
last semester with the help of Lesley Del-
menico, Theatre, who helped him to get over
his initial fear of writing anything, and then
over the fear of what he had already written. "I
worked with Lesley because she's such a nurr
turing presence," said Wright. “The challenge
{or me was just to keep writing... 1 knew as
I wrote the first play, which would become
‘Summei Quartetfthat itwas horrible.”

“Horrible's a rough word, but 1 would say
in comparison to what we have now, it’s an ap
propriate one,"said Davies.

Davies and Wright have a unique work-
ing relationship, with Davies “strong sense of
stage composition" anchoring Wright's admis
sion that he is “definitely not a big picture pert
son".The fact thatWright will be acting in two
of the plays, “Voices in Time" and “Looking
Back," also made Davies' presence required.

However, the emotional closeness that
Wright feels to the play and the compressed
timeframe of the entire project necessitited
his coedirecting role, rather than just leaving
the entire production to Davies. “It's Jayscn's
baby, and just asking me to direct it would have
been unfair to him,"said Davies. "I'd only seen
the script two weeks ago.”

This process carries over into the script
even now, as Wright constantly tweaks the
play to match the sounds he wants to hear
onstage. "If the language doesn't sound right
in my mouth, out their mouths,we change it,"
said Wright. He wants actors to “tell [him]
where you think your monologues peak, and
we'll reintegrate what you think.”

Cast members have already found in the
limited time they've spent with Wright and

Davies that their viewpoints on the play's die
rection have been respected. “Jaysen’s letting
us take the characters where we wantgthem to
go," said Kelly an’twwvho plays a conserva-
tive religious scholar in “Voices in Time."“lt's
a really fun character for me to play, because
I'm from a plaee where people are actuahy like
that and Jaysen wants that character to be as
sympathetic as possible, he doesn't want her to
be totally vitriolic."

But the cast has limited time for changes.
Since half of the cast (including Wright) are
currently preparing for the third mainrstage
production, Galileo, they only plan to meet
once a week to work on the play until Galileo
ﬁnishes in March. Afterwards the production
wiil proceed at high speed until the end.

In April, the play will be performed in
Flanagan Theatre directly before or after the
spring dance show in Roberts Theatre. Davies
and Wright plan to use all of the resources
available to a mairrstage show (sound, lights
ing. etc.) for the play, though they anticipate
needing limited sets.

What they have seemed to want so rat. is
a unique project notjust for Grinnell, but for
any theatre, anywhere. “I like how free of judgr
ment the entire process has been so far," says
Rev Darragh ’12.“We’ve been talking about
respect and transcending stigma, transcending
viewpoints, and I’m working with only older
actors, and there's always, or there seems to be
in many cases, discrimination against younger
actors, and I haven’t felt that at all yet.”

The auditions, which yielded only firsts
year and seniors performers, allow the pair
terns ofthe play and the process to emerge: to
grow, but to remain grounded in the emotional
power of theatre. It sums up four years for the
seniors, and shows the younger generation
how to push boundaries. It‘s difficult, worry-
ing about authenticity and cliche and love and
sex. Its contradictions come out in the last line
of the play, which Wright, characteristically,
both loves and hates, but nonetheless delivered
with his usual panache during a recent read
through.

“What are the ties that bind?”
