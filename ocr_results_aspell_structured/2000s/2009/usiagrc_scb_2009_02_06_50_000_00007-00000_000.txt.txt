Tropic Thunder
(2 008)

Robert Downey Jr. propels satire

Despite the media scufﬂe, the biggest
target ofridiculc iu Troprr Tiaorlo—a flashy,
nasty, riprroariug and assaultive sendup of
Hollywood~is not the mentally challenged

The targets of this extreme comedy's
freerflowing contempt are the stars, makers,
brokers, miscellaneous supplicants and even
dierhard fans of Hollywood, all portrayed
as challenged in some fashion: intellectually,
ethically, aesthetically, sattorially, chemically
and longitudrnally.

Twpir Thunder, named after the meme
oir by Vietnam veteran John “Four Leaf"
Tdcyback (Nick Nolte) details the make
irrg of a picture touted as “the biggest war
frlm ever." Except the movie is helmed by a
prestigious but lessrthanrcompetent direcr
tor with a stupidly hilarious name, Damien
Cockbutn (stevc coogau) and stars a cast of
actors whose egos are as big as water tanks
and fragile as quails' eggsrThe picture is off
schedule and over budget, the performers are
messing up right and left.

To get the film back on track, Cockburn
leads his actors deep into thc jungle to scare
good performances out oftliem. Call it “77;:
Blair Wilt/J Pr-ojarl” approach, where actors
can’t be trusted to actually act. From there,
the production becomes nothing but chaos.
In fact, it ceases being a production at all.

Coekburn is ordered by studio executive
Les Grossrnan (Tom cruise, in a stunning
cameo) to get the production back on track
or risk having it shut down. The rest of the
movie involves hilarious encounters between
the crew, their capture at the hands of the
heroinrproducing Flamrng Dragon gang,
and their subsequent escape.

Now trapped in the Vietnamese jungle,
the quartet of actors must attempt to deal
with each other, A visibly iackednrp Ben
Stiller, directing his first feature since leI-
under, plays action hero Tugg Spectimun
(think Rambo), whose career is in decline.
There’s Alptl Chino (Brandon Jackson), a
black rapper who has made bank peddling
‘Boory Sweat: the energy drink that helps
buyers “tap into some ass." Jeff Portnoy (Jack
Black) is the import from the comedy scene,
best known for The Fartics, a movie series
in which Jeff, aping Eddie Murphy in T112
Nully Prafeim, portrays an entire family of
prodigious tartars. Rounding up the group
is Robert Downey, Jr., who, post-lrournan,
seems to have acquired the Midas touch in
Hollywood on screen, he essays the role of
Kirk Lazarus, a five-time Academy Award
winning white Aussie so wedded to Method»
acting that he has had “pigmentation-altera-
tion procedure“surgery to make him black.

The performances range from adequate
to stellar, with one exception. Downey, Jr.
stands head and shoulders above the rest of
the crew,nnd his mastery ofrrccents is lmpcv
cable. Stiller is his usual sclf: funny in small
doses, Jack Black, however, is disappoiutrng,
too loud and over the top, he hams thmuglr
out the movie. Tom Cruise’s stirring cameo.
however, more than makes up for any ground

The jokes are often funny, and somctimcs
downright hilarious, although the movie
presupposes knowledge of pop culture. At
one point, poor Tugg Speedman is hurting
inside because his previous film was “Simple
Jack”~where, with excruciating lack of taste,
he plays a young man with mental disabilities
that failed to pique anyone’s intciest. The
frlm died horribly at the box offrce.

Lazarus tells him why: "Never go full—

The resulting love triangle sounds pre-

have rapidly become a rehash ofa Truffaut

all the gaps with condescending and often
ridiculous aSides.

the results are utterly hilarious,

But the ﬁlm doesn’t really belong to
Johausson, or even Bardarn, for that mat-
ter. The often-underestimated Penelope
Cruz upstages everyone with her refresh-
ingly overstated performance. She stars as
Bardem’s moderately psychotic ex-wife, and
her sizzling screen presence really brings the
heat to the love triangle (or is it a quadran—
gle?) that forms the scaffolding of the plot.
Cruz pushes every scene to extreme levels of
emotionality as she tries to win the love of
Bardern (and per rps even Johaiisson).

Luckily, Virty Cristina Barcelona doesn't
peddle some sort of moral at the end, Ale
