Bias-motivated
incidences
arouse activism

In chalk, in posters and in speech, Grinnell students
came out in numbers this past week to make the statement
that they will ﬁght against prejudice, bias and intolerance
This wave of protest erupted in response to a public, ho—
mophobic comment that disturbed many members of the
Grinnell cornmunuy.

that demonstrate

about homophobia
The incident fell under the deﬁnition of“bias motivated ins
cident” category, and did not warrant police involvement, yet
has undoubtedly still impacted campus life,

In August, even before the school year ofﬁcially began,
Ragnar Thorisson '10 observed a similar sentiment ex-
pressed on a \vhiteboald in Younker. Soon after, Elliot Karl
'12 noticed an offensive claim abour a student's sexuality, aca
companied by a crude graphic. in Rathje 1st, targeting a difr
ferent room than the one this past weekend. In fact, accord—
ing to Nichole Baker '10 ofthc student antisdiscrimlnation
group AJusr, homophobia is so commonplace that “at every
[Alust] meeting, at least one member comes forward and
says something like, ‘In this class we had a really problematic
discussion that deals with oppression,'or, ‘The other day this
happened.”

This week, Grinnellians responded with a massive cams
paign promoting acceptance of diversity. Jon Richardson ’10
and fellow students from the Stonewall Resource Center den
cided to voice their opinions about the incident through the
power ofspeech across campus. on Monday morning, post-
ers and chalksscribed expressions such as “Gay? Okay! Not
gay? Okayl"were plastered all over campus, mostly outside
the Joe Rosenfield ’25 center and the East loggia, especially
near the entrance to Rathje. “We want to reclaim Grinneil
as a school that celebrates diversity of all kinds," Richardson
said.

The SRC has not acted alone. Student leaders from the
LGBT community collaborated with the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) in writing an SGA resolution that
condemns any form ofintolerance.

“These are things than we should engage and discours
age...It is our responsibility to confront these expressions
of prejudice and say, ‘This is not acceptable,” said SGA
President Harry Krejsa ’10.The resolution was unanimously
passed at the Joint Board meeting and was released in an all
campus email on Thursday morning that included a mes-
sage from Krejsa.

In addition to these measures, AJust intends to soon es
tablish a program called Grinnell Talk—a discussion-based
group through which people can grapple with beliefs or
opinions they feel are not accepted at Grinncll, such as ho
mophobia. “This will be an outlet [tor such people], so they
won’t need to create an outlet in some other way,"said Baker,
on behalf ofAJust.

In contrast to last week‘s disagreements about the release
of the Hate crime Response Policy, the student body and
the administration are making a point of working together
to oversee a productive response to the events that trans-

Active Minds raise awareness

BY SHANNA NICOLS

This past week, Active Minds of Grinnell,a group on campus
that works to promote mental health awareness, hosted a series
of events to encourage open discussion about different mental
health issues.

Active Minds is a national organization that works nations
ally to de-stigmatize mental health problems and locally to make
sure that the College is promoting suitable mental health services
for students. Founded on campus lastyear, Active Minds has cre-
ated awareness of the resources available to college students on
campus and in town.

“You don’t find time to take care of
yourself, you make time," said Wellness co-
ordinator Jen Jacobsen. '

Active Minds originally began in 2001
when a student at the University of Pennr
sylvania. Alison Malmon, lost her brother to
suicide. Since then a national ofﬁce was “8*
ated and different chapters have been lead
by other college students across the country.

on the Grinnell campus, Active Minds
has hosted events such as Qiestion, Per-
suade, Refer (QPR) Training to teach stu-
dents how to prevent suicide. Poweshiek County Mental Health
Center Liaison and Active Minds coordinator Alicia Sundsmo
led the session held on Wednesday and answered questions about
how to recognize warning signs of suicide crisis amongst peers.

Another session held Thursday was dedicated to Depres-
sion Screening where snidents could ﬁll out questionnaires and
choose to go over their results with a counselor from the PCs
MHC. They even included therapy dogs to encourage arrens
dance by students who might be apprehensive about attending a
mental health related event,

committee, rhe Grinnell chapter, led by Andrea Leiser '11 and
Chris Hildebrand '10 has grown to include just under 20 stun
dents.

‘ According to Alyssa Penner ’10, previous coaleader ofActive
Minds, there is a lot of misinformation about the my Mental
Health is dealt with on campus.

“All the resources here are for anyone, you can go and talk
about a random bad day you’ve had, iryou're concerned about a
friend, or just go for anything," Penner said.

Hildebrand said that half of the problem surrounding the if
sue of mental health is that too many individuals do not want to
talk about it, yet students at Grinnell expe-
rience these issues more often than similar
small institutions.

“Grinnell is competitive in terms of the
all around person, and at times people don’t
want admit weakness," Hildebrand said.

By looking at the Health Center in
the past, one can notice improvements that
have been made. In this past year about 20
percent otstudents made use ofthe mental
health services and for the graduating class
of 2009 about 50 percent of them received
services at least one in their career here.

One of the misconceptions that Dean for Student Academic
support and Advising Joyce Stern said she notices is that all too
often the message is relayed that once one comes to college, he or
she is suddenly a fully independent adult. She said ﬁlnctioning
successfully here is about being interdependent and learning how
to use your resources.

Active Minds meets on Mondays at 6 pm. and welcome new
members. This November, they will be sending two members
will be sent to the National Active Minds convention.
