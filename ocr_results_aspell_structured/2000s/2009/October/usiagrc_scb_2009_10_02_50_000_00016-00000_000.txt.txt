THE WEATHER: It makes the walks from

Class to class pretty unpleasant, but it also
makes it really easy to sleep late into the
mornin 5 because it’s alwa s so dark out.

 

THE START OF SWIM SEASON: Our

fishy friends will be even Clique-ier in
the dining hall, only now they’ll stink

To the Editor: I rest my case.The
Imnodart, the new student paper,
was formed partially in reaction to
the inadequacy which we perceived
in the 5&3. Your article on the
Iconoclast in the Sept. 26 issue sim—
ply confirms this. It is an example of
shoddyjoumalism and poor editing.
The facts are incorrect, the quota—
tions are inaccurate, and the last
sentence is pure ﬁction.

Don’t lock up campus bikes

Friday afternoon in my omgvclasses-are-
over- it's- ﬁnally me weekend haze ofhappiness
iwas exiting theJRC and to my dismay, noticed

* something unbelievable on Loose beach. On this

wonderful Friday aftemoon, the most pristine of
all weekday afternoons, someone ms LOCK-
ING UP A CAMPUS BIKE. After taking a
moment to calm down, I thought to myself,
“Perhaps this poor uninformed person is simply
a ﬁrst year who does not lmow any better," but
alas, as I came closerl reallzed,rhat this was no
ﬁrst year. This person is someone that I have
seen around {or at least a year. This person was
older than a ﬁrst year and should know better.
Dear at-least-assecond-yoar, don’t lock up cam-
pus bikesAs an econ major I feel the need to tell
you, YOU’RE ABUSING THE FREAKING
COMMONS,

Don’t lock up campus bikes

I was sitting in Liner Lounge, doing ah»
solutely nothing, when I saw some WIENERn
FACED PUNK locking up a campus bike.
While I didn’t get a read on their face, gait,
height or any other identifying factor,I did get
a. read on their personaiiry. MEAN SPIRITED.
Dont lock up campus bikes UNLESS YOU’VE
BEEN GIVEN WRITTEN PERMISSION.
I know you weren't given this aforementioned

permission because that doesn’t actuall exist. SO
JUST DON’T,

Don’t lock up campus bikes

One day Lhis past week, I amkcncd from an
afternoon nap at 4:56 PM Though purely cons
scious,I somehow managed to realize the urgen-
cy of the situation at hand—I had a 5 p.m. meet-
ing to attend. As I scrambled across the south
campus beaches, my bleary eyes thrilled to the
sight of a campus bike awaiting me. However,
as I approached it,l noticed an unwelcome lock
on the rear tire of this bike. Unfortunately, this
yellow steel savior of my punctuality was immo-
bilized, and l was forced to be late to‘ my meet-
ing after all. Campus bikes are intended for the
campus, notjusr for youAs tempting as it maybe
:0 lock up public resources, let’s not, mm’kay?
