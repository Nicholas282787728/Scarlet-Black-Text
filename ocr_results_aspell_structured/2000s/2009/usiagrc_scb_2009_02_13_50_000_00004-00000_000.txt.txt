BBC to make documentary on Robert Noyce ’49

BY BRIAN SHERWIN

From Feb 7 to 9, a British Broadcasting
Company (BBC) ﬁlm crew collected root-
Ige or interviews with proressors, science
experiments and farm InIInIls for I docu-
mentnry on Robert Noyce '49.

The documentary, scheduled to air
sometime In the spring on BBC, will focus
on former Trustee Noyce, eo-Inventor of
the integrated circuit and the co-founder of
Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel.

John Das, the documentaty’s producer,
writer and director, said his interest in Noyce
Is largely due to his unique ﬁgure as In In-
ventor and entrepreneur. “He was basically

the key pioneer of Silicon
SGA

valley beam the companies he Set up de
fined wlIII Silicon Valley IctuIlly became,"
DIs said.

Das’interestinNoyce’s eIrly days brought
him to Grinnell. where he first began the
experiments that would lead him to InvenII
Ing the integrated circuit. During their time
In Grinnell, the BBC crew focused on how
Grinnell ImpIcted Noyce's life Is In entre-
preneur,

“They [were] really looking II the
Grinnell portion of the Robert Noyce story
as Grinnell being the starting place of this
man’s Incredible journey," sIIid Kate Worsrer
’87, director orcomrnuIIIcIIIon.

According to Das, Noyce's years Is I

physics student It Grinnell were especIIlly
formative, “He tried to create an environ—
ment where everyone could talk to each
other, exchange ideas. . . He liked to be in
the ab bouncing IdeIs offpeople. .. . He was
very non-hierarchical in that sense and he
encouraged scientists to think as freely as
possible,” Das said. “I think that is some’
thing that comes back to his Grinnell up
bringing."

For the documentary’s setting, the crew
captured the town, campus and Iowas age
ricultural landscapes. Das said they spet
cIrIcIlly filmed I Grinnell IreI pig farm to
help tell the infamous pig slaughter story, in
which Noyce stole III area hog and butche

cred it in Clark HallI

The crew filmed a lecture by William
Case, Physics, on Noyce‘s IIInoIIItIons. "They
were loekIIIg for different was to explain
exactly how the transistor and integrated
circuit work for someone who might not
have III Idea about those things," said An—
ders Ahlberg ‘10, who sat in on the lecture.

The documentarians interviewed former
president George Drake, History, and Chart
lie Duke, Physics about their experiences
with Noyce. “He was very open with his eye
on accomplishing things but not on status,"
said Drake, who was on the Board ofTrustt
ees with Noyce. “In that way, I think he was
I very typical Grinnelian."

 

rIIrs John Burrows '10 In
describing strident percep—
tions about administrative
decision making. “We feel a
lot of these new administrators are coming
from places where they have I rules-based
culture and they base their student affairs

from p. 1

Hoye IIlso said she had been IpproIched
by a number of students who serve on com-
mIttecs with faculty Ind felt that their power
In the groups wIs seriously limited.

Despite the topics IddIIessed, chIner
members emphasized I need to move for-
ward. “Right now we're sort of just going

 

profession on national models
., whereas at Grinnell we have a
valuestbased culture.”

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Julie Hoye '09 echoed
similar concerns about transpart
ency in faculty decisions, Hoye
recounted efforts to change the
Faculty Handbook policy on
class attendance during religious
holidays after a student had to
drop I course after being penal-

 

as“

through the process of
raising awareness and
consciousness of students
about the issues and
how we need to do some

lack of communication"
Burrows said in an inter
view. “and how we need to
refocus on what really
in the best interest ofstut
dents,"

\ I§ thing tangible about the

’e

 

 

ized for missing class for I reli-
gious obligation.

Hoye said the response, a letter encour-
Iging greater understanding of religious
obligations, seemed too tepid becIuse there
was no policy ehnnge. “There was the per-
ception or the thought that because the
policy wasn’t changed, there wasn’t any way
to hold faculty accountable for this sort of
change," Hoye said.

After Cabinet mem-
bers had delivered their presentation to the
full Board of Trustees this past weekend,
some students learned of the subject matter
and were concerned that SGA had misrep-
resented student sentIment or Irresponsibly
cast blame upon either the faculty or admin-
istrators.

In a post on the popular cybertforum
GrinnellPlans, Sollie Flora ’07 expressed

concern that the SGA presentation to the
Trustees had IIIIpproprIItely charged faculty
without evidence and encouraged students
to keep SGA members “accountable."

Parvoneh Shirgir ’09 who said she had
concerns about the presentation after reads
Ing Floris Plans post, attended the Wednes-
dIy presentation to learn what SGA had told
the Trustees. While she ind she generally
agreed with the presentations message Ibout
the campus climate. she took Issue with the
characterization ofstudcnt opinion.

“I don't think that' It 5 fair to say that stu—
dents feel. this way because I wasnt asked, "
Shirglr I personnlly encourage faculty
interaction in current affairs even if [those
current affairs] are in the administration or
Strident Affairs. So I don't think it's fair to
characterize students as saying that we don’t
feel comfortable with this because I would
actually want more ofit."

Trustee LIurI Ferguson '90, who serves
as chair ofthe Board’s Student Affairs Come
mitten, said she thought the presentation 55,
chewed casting blame or singling out groups
"I didn’t think it was hostile,"she said “They
were by no means saying thIt all the faculty
are doing this and I know rhIs is I very Iso-
lated problemI It wIs I very even-handed

approach,"

While highlighting recent tensions be-
tween the faculty and administration, the
presentation Ilso touched on I number or
other student life issues. Hoye rIIsed con-
cerns about student wellness, citing In-
cI-eIsed property destruction and that on
campus Ind I more thIn threefold increase
In hospitalizations compared to last year.

Among speciﬁc measures designed to
help IIIllchnte tensions and build communie
ty, Burrows included updating the Strategic
Plan to include an emphasis on studentwellt
ness and creating an orientation program to
introduce new faculty and administrators to
the College’s culture and values.

Ferguson sIId thII while Trustees were
always concerned about strident life and
that the Board is “concerned and taking this
matter very seriously," the Trustees were not
necessarily the most appropriIte Ivenue for
enIctIng change Ind instead encouraged
students to seek reform directly on campus.

“I think generIlly our goal is to help
them go to the right plIce," she said. “Go
through the mud chInnels because [the
people In] student Affairs Ire the ones that
cIn help you with self-governance It the end
oflhe dIy, not the Trustees."
