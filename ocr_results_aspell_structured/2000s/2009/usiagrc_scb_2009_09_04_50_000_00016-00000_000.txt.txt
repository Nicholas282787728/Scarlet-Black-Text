September 22, 1937

Say what you will about this year’s
crop of freshmen, at least one little
girl is learning fast. Though we don’t
know her name, she must be all right,
because she has the honor of opening
the 1937 sporting season, whether in—
tentionally or not. She was seen last
night strolling arm in arm with some
unidentiﬁed gentleman across Ward
ﬁeld heading for the bleachers. Or
maybe she was merely picking out a
good seat for tomorrow’s game.

Despair over worn out PCard Don't study in the weight roam Too hot, too cold, never just right

After dutifully serving me for three years, my
P-card decided that it wasn‘t going ru he read
anymore hy the Dining Hall swipers. I guess ride
ing around in my back pocket for six semesters
was too much for Lhe little guy Graciously. :1 din—
ing hnll employee offered to procure n new one
for me While I enjoyed my meal. Sweet... until
I learned from a friend that 1 will have to for}:
over 15 greenbaeks for the replacement. Not so
sweet. I feel I should be rewarded for not los»
ing my card for three years and he Allowed one
free replacement or Grinnel] should buck up and
provide students with sturdier cards Let's be real

s my credit card is twice as old andshuws half -

the wear.

I ms working up a sweat on a srarionary bike
in the gym. There were usual sounds of heavy
breathing and the usual smell of sweat. BUT
there was a very unusual sight in the gym. . . On
the upstairs workout mat there was n girl wearing
jeans! A swearshirr! And worst ofall doing HER
HOMEVVORK! This girl rhought die best
plnce to have her binders and books spread out
was the upstairs mar ofrhe gym. She wasn't even
pretending to stretch, Come on people! The last
thing I want to see as I am working my butt
off is someone leisurely daing homework! It is
ridiculous for you to think that taking up half of
a gym mat is cool! It’s not like treadmill sounds
make studying easier! So if you want to study,
GO TO BURLING!
