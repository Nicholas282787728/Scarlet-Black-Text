‘Noynk’ commemorates Noyce

Robert Noyce’s notorious pig stealing inspires a Grinnell tradition

BY MANDO MoN'mNo
The most popular story told on Grinnell’s campus

tours is now becoming a tradition.

This Saturday on Mac Field {10m
4 pm. to 10 p.m., SGA will hold
“Noynk”ia townrwide pig roast and
barbecue to celcbtate Robert Noyce's
ootlt anniversary as a Grinnell alumnus,

The event originates from an
instance when Noyce. as a Grinnell
student, stole a pig from a local farm.
slaughtered it in the Clark Hall pit
bathroom, toasted it on Mac Field and
was close to expulsion when the police
arrested him.

"It's great to have Grinncll’s most
illustrious and notable alumnus to have

“People always remembered the story of Robert

Noyce roasting a pig on campus tours," O'Grady said. “I

thought that would make a great event."

”It’s great to have Grime/ls most
illustrious and numb/e alumnus
[a have this endearing Story”

Harry Krisja ’lO
SGA President

Board of Trustee member, John
gan ’57, did not hear about Noyce's pig
exploits even though he started Grinnell
four yeais arter Noyce graduated.

“I think it takes until your generation
to hear about those stories," Egan said.

o‘Grady has sent out 724 invites to
faculty and staff. The event is expected
to not only celebrate Robert Noyce's
escapades, but also build Grinncll's
community with staff and faculty

“We hold a lot of campus-wide
bonding events like 10/10, but that’s
restricted to the students of Grinnell,”

this endearing story," SGA President Harry Kresia '10 O’Grady said. “But I wanted to have something that
brings together not just college students, but faculty,

said.

All campus Events (ACE) Chair and Noynk creator,

Mairead O’Grady ’10, thought of the celebratory luau

while she was giving cainpns tours.

Grinnellians often ask themselves how a Grinncll education will help them in life. We do not obtain degrees in
easily marketable or transferable majors like architecture or accounting and there are few clear career trajectories for Grinnell
graduates. While this uncertainty can be difﬁcult at times, it also allows Grinnellians to form creative career paths with the
tools that an employer does not have time to teach you.You can be taught technical skills, but no employer has the time to
teach you how to think critically, write clearly, or communicate effectively. Appreciate your Grinnell education-- Grinnell
provides you with the intellectual tools to do anyjob and develops graduates ready to make a difference in this world
