‘ Lc Kick the Night, an \liIEI’lthlUn\lly
o Izcd eIcnr, stems from the second II we
feminist movement of the 19705 that aimed
to tar watch I regarding SUMIﬂl 'ssilult

"The historical past is rctIlly the best part
about [Take Back the Niglitl," .Iid Emma
Lawler'o9, an organizer ofthc consent work»
shop event. “its been happening for years and
years. Our take on it is tint it can be new, but
it also hearkcns bIck to the history of how
many women have been having ,

The week began with a s1 Io .ng of Law
and order: special Victims Unit," and was
followed by The Clothesline PIoject, a dis
cussion concerning intimate partner violence,
a student demonstration throughout campus,
a consent workshop, and will end with Walk
A Mile in Her Shoes in Marshalllown, on
Sunday.

The seIics of events is not only meant to
raise awareness of sexual \llolcnce. but also
serve as a space where survivors or sexual
abuse and assault can talk about their experle
ences.

“[Ta Itck the Night] is about reclaim—
ing the night as a space where women can
feel safe abour walking home at night alone
and not be afraid of rape or scIual assault,"
said JessicII Southald 10, I member of FAC.

One ofthc lougcstrstanding tIttditions in
Take Back the Night is the Clothesline Projs
act, which can currently be seen in the spen-
ccr Grill. The project consists of students
made (Tshlrts that bear messages regarding
sexual Violence and abuse, which are then
hung on display in the Grill.

"The Clothesline Project is something
that Grinnell has been doing for a while,"
said Zoe Schein ‘12, a participant in the
event. “Personally, I think it's really effective.
This raises awareness, and then people hope-
fully try and do something about it. I think

that it is a really important part ofit, though
it isn’t the only event."

Another event held during the week was
the consent workshop, led by Lawler. During
the workshop, participants learned how to
practice asking for and giving verbal consent,
as well as how to make it “sexy," Lawler said.

”The consent workshop was maybe one
or the most important things we can do in
terms of solutions," Lawler said. “I think the

consent workshop is one thing you can do to
really actively change the rape culture . . . ac-
tively trying to put consent as a part of that
script can have a huge street on the number
ofsexunl rape and assaults."

According to Lawler, the event is im
portant to the entire Campus, regardless of
whether they have experienced sexual assault
or not. '

“Even if people don't know someone

who's been affected, they probably have a
friend who hasn’t told rh:m,”said Lawler.

Lawlet said she hopes that Take Back
the Night will make a permanent impact on
the campus, notjust this year, but in years to
come.

“I hope that every year it gets bigger and
bigger and that it becomes a conversation
that we have on Campusithat it's something
that we talk about," Lawler said.

Grinnell’s coolness validated

Results in for coolest town, Grinnell ranks third

BY SARAH BLACK

While Grinncll may not be the hippest
or hottest place to live, in the minds ofIn-
ternet voters, it is at least one ofthc coolest.

Grinnell placed third with over 9,000
votes in Budget Travel Magazine's yearly
Coolest Small Towns contest. The results,
drawn from internet votes for 22 reader-
nominated towns with fewer than 10,000
residents, were announced on CBS’s Early
Show last Wednesday.

The first two spots were won in a land-
slide by owego, New York and Rockland,
Maine, each receiving over 22,000 votes.
Grinnell was the highcst»ranked Mid-
western town, followed by the Midwest
wine capital of Vevay, lndiana, which gar
nered almost 8,000 Votes. The results can
be viewed at Budget Ttavcl’s website, Buds
gctTravelcom.

"I think it’s cool," said SGA Presi-
dent Neo Momke '10. “There are parts of
Grinnell that people don't get to see. Alto-
gether it’s a good town. l'm glad I put [the
contest] on my Plan, that it got people to
vote."

Sierra Strossberg '10, who grew up in
Grinnell, said the results would pique the
attention of students and townspeople
alike. “I think it's something a lot or people
are going to be happy about it. There are

a lot of people like the Chamber of Come
meree who work really hard,” strassberg
said. “I'm actually impressed with it."

Some Grinnell College students, like
Mairead O’Grady '10, think that the “cool-
est" part of Grinnell is the abundance of
small businesses. O'Grady cited the Come
back Cafe as a uni% uely Grinnellian asset.
“I go to Comeback are three or four times
a week and always order the number 11,"
O’Grady said. “The Comeback Café is my
favorite part of Grinnell.”

Nick Johnson, a Grinnell resident who
left to attend Kenyon last semester, ex-
pressed little surprise over the results. “I
feel like New York and Maine usually get
props for being cooler than Iowa. I wouldn't
expect to be the coolest.“

“Sure, it’s cool," Johnson added “But I
think [Grinnell] would seem more inter-
esting ifI was passing through or visiting
instead ofliving there.”

Emily lwuc ’08 lived in town for nine
months after graduation and moved to
Minneapolis this February. in a previous
intervrew regarding the competition, Iwuc
said, “1 suppose I was mistaken about Grine
nell’s standing relative to other towns."

“Rockland, that's a pretty cool town,"
lwuc said. “There are worse places to lose
to."
