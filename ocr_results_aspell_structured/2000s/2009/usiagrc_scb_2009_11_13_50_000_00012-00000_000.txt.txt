An individual’s experience with trans awareness week

On Tuesday, Sara Montolla ’1 O participated in ”cross—dress to Class day” and made a discovery about what gender might mean

In the name of trans awareness week (in I), I decided
to participate in "Crossedressing to class ay" which, ac-
cording to the e—mail from the Stonewall Resource Center,
should have been pretty ensy—“gcnderbcnd [our] outﬁts
and wear [them] to class," it said. However, the goal of
“gender-bending" outfits was unclear. wcre participants
supposed to be imitating trans people to make their struge
gIe visible on campus> Or
was cross-dressing sup-
posed to push and/or blur
the boundaries of gender
norms? Or was it reinforc-
ing gender performativity?

\thn I made the deer
sion to “cross" over to the
other side, i thought about
what kind ofa “man"l would be ifI had been born a male.
Not surprisingly, I went for baggy clothes to imitate the
persona of ii “ballet,” but at the and I came to terms With
the fact that I would have become a “tliolo” ifborn a male
in my neighborhood.

So on Nov. 10, 2009, the ritual of transition started by
singing “Na, Na, Naaaena, hey, hey, goodbyel" Arter showe
ering and saying goodbye to the "woman" in inc, 1 was as
ready as could be to get rid of my most obvious “womanly"
partsimy breasts I looked for my tightest sports bra to
contain my breasts, so that itwould be easier to bind them
with gauze. 1 put on my “calsonzillosLmalc underweari,
my black jeans, my black “wifeebeater,” black socks and a
ﬂannel shirt.I styled my long black hair into a braid like
the old cholos and put a blue bandana across my forehead.
As i said goodbye to my Jainaia gangster's girlfriend—
I became really scared to face the world as a “man," but
in true cholo style 1 hid behind my black sunglasses and
my machista attitude, “grew some balls" and I walked out
into the loggia singing the song by Down AKA Kilo in my

like a “wannabe."This only made me want to run to class
and hide behind closed doors, but I know that no “vato
loco,” or gangster, would ever be caught running unless
they were unarmed. l was trying to arm myselfwith confir

said, “Confidencehelps

the tone and
the rest of
the reading,
it seemed like no matter how much couf‘le

when I noticed one ofmy male classmates had worn a ﬂir-

a black tie. This is what the cemail had meant! “Gendere

and I self identify as a woman. On Nov. 10,1 was dressed
as a cholo instead ofa chola and l was using

So who was 1? That’s the pointi‘I was part

As I sat in my LGBTQ Studies class
listening to Professor Astrid Henry review
the critical readings about gender as “highly
performatrve," my gauze came undone. My
breasts popped out like two little hills being
crushed by a huge hammer. During a break
from class, i went up to my friend and lifted
up my shirt to show him how the gauze had
not worked. That simple act of lifting up
my shirt made-me realize that clothes and

of a “gray area" that bent gender norms. My
"performance"was no longer imitating men,
but instead I was just wearing the clothes
I wanted to wear Without worrying about
whether the label had instiiictions on what
gender can wear them.

This ambiguity is the beginning of a
long process towards accepting people‘s dif-
ferences. It is the first step in providing a
space that can instigate conversations that
aim to decrease ignorance about transgender
identity, issues and discrimination. But be
fore those safe spaces are provided in public
places, we need to start asking questions of

Corrections to DVA/SAC article

We wanted to take the time to thank
you for running an article about the work
DVA/SAC does on campus. Training to
become an advocate is a huge commit-
ment, and recognition of this commitment
is greatly appreciated. We would like to
quickly clarify a few points that last week's
article on DVA/SAC left unclear:

' -The acronym DVA/SAC stands for
Domestic Violence Alternatives/Sexual
Assault Center (her student).

. :l'hc Iowa Coalition Against Domestic
Violence (ICADV) is a state level coalition
that oversees member projects throughout
the state. DVA/SAC is one ofthese meme
ber projects, serving Tama, Poweshiek, Jase
per and Marshall counties.

-The campus group called DVA/SAC
Campus Advocates is a group of students
who have been trained by DVA/SAC staff.

The Red Flag campaign occurred on

We call them
“Iettulors.”

Newspaper distribution issues

I am dismayed to learn ofthe decision
not to deliver print copies ofthe 3631? to
every faculty and staff member (as you did’
not mention administrators, I assume they
continue to get print copies). At the same
time,I am totally sympathetic with the
economic calculations that led to this dec'r
sion. 1 will put aside, out of good will, any
questions about why, after all these years,

the sea, with administration support and
no consult with faculty, suddenly decided
to stop print distribution to the non-stu-
dent members oftl'ie Grinnell community,
I choose not to think that this has any
thing to do with‘last spring’s active use of
the SSH to thrash out a dispute between
faculty members and the administration.
Allow me, instead, to strongly suggest that -
the we offer subscriptions to faculty and
staffso that we have the option to re-
ceive print copies in our mailboxes. These
subscriptions can be calculated to recoup
your extra costs. Indeed, 1 suggest you offer
nonestudent members of the community
the opportunity to subscribe at a couple
of different levelsisome will choose to
pay for the cost of their copy, others ofus
would choose to contribute beyond basic
costs in order to strengthen your budgetary
situation.

The tripartite theme in every discussion

on campus right now is community, com-
munication and campus unity. Rather than
taking this moment to constrain commu-
nication on campus, I urge you (a take the
opportunity to ask faculty and staffto pull
together with you in an effort to stay on
the black side of the Scarletij/ark’s ledger
sheer. Don’t cut us off—or send us to the
website that you know will be forgotten
on busy Friday afternoons. Bring us in, let
us help you with this problem, make us
your subscribers, not your former readers.
