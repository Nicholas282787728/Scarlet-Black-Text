Grinnell students are more judgmental than we claim

Ah, springtime. In this column the last
of my college career, I would like to reﬂect
on something I have noticed about Grinnell
over rhe yeilrsifor all us clarms ofbeing tols
erant, this school has a
legendary rumor mill.

Rumors about Dagor

hir (Dag) members,

especially, constitute

some of the ugliest of

the bunch. While I

am loath to repeat them here. in fear of their
further propagation, i feel that to be dispelled
they must be confronted outright.

Take this rrrsr, orrrrcpeared rumor. “Dag
house-doesn't that place have orgies?" The
answer is: no, it doesn’t. Nor has it ever. Des

spite this rumot’s falsity, the fantastical allega-

tion has existed since before my first year at

Grinnell, and it has become so legendary that

for a time it even became an insidejoke among

Dag house mem-

bers. That the

- , rumor morphed

' over time from

merely one air

leged orgy, itself

untrue, Into an

outsandsout Bang Bros extravaganza attests

to the scale of the Gi‘innell rumor mill. Dag

house might have had some Wild parties In Its

past, but Romansstyle orgies have never been
a part of the organization,

That's a milder one, however Some of

them border on the' Insane Consider this one:
“I heard rhar in order to join Dag you have to
fuck the leaders of the organization." Frankly,
this tumor should both disconcerl and outrage
anyone who hears it. Essentially, it alleges that
Dag leaders engage in seaual. quid pro quo
with their members, an activity borh illegal
and, more importantly, morally repugnant. As
exotic as it may secnr,j ' 'ng Dag does not
require sexual initiation. What possible pur-
pose. indeed, could this rumor serve, besides
to make the gioup seem bizarrely foreign and
therefore more worthy of idle chatter?

I shouldn’t have to say it, but since rumors
about Dag never seem to die,I’ll go ahead and
say it anyway: stop it. These rumors are im—
mensely damaging to your fellow students. By

spreading these rumors, you only sow prerr
dice on campus among your classmates. For
some, to be called a “Dag kid” is a veritable
epithet. For a school that prides itself on its
acceptance of various lifestyles, even Grinnell
seems to have its limits.

As inherently strange as playing with foam
swords may seem, there Is no reason to hyper-
bolizc the group’s strangeness by sexualizlng
their activities. Long story short, the next time
you sec some students playing Dag, walk up to
them and ask ifyou can play. Chances are the
players will be more than eager to hand you a
weapon, teach you the rules and get you in the
game. Like any club, Dag just wants to have
tun and they’d be ppy ifyou joined them as
well. No sexual in' ation required.

Nevermind newspapers, Kindles are the next big

When the Internet ﬁrst became a part ofthe mainstream world,
lwas probably (00 young to notice or care. In fact,I can hardly res
member a world without the InremeL It’s always been there, like a
nice triend always willing to help me out wheneverl need it. And
hey, I Wouldn't have it any odrer way. It makes my life immensely
easier, both for academia and tor amusement.

So picture for a moment whar our world would be like without
it. No e-mail, no Faceboolc no Wikipe~
dia, no CNN.com, no wrdespread dise
seminarion of easy information, down-
loaded articles, pirated movics / TV
shows (not that any of us upstanding
Gr inrrellians do such hernous driugs).

It’s a scary thought. I’m pretty sure carn-
pus—scratch that, the world—would be avcry weird and conﬁlsing
place. I’d probably have to actually go to dre library on occasion,

You see, while the 5&3 is ﬁinded mostly by our beloved
SPARC, and therefore, by the College and die student activities

economics. and frankly, not much ofthat Is making sense at all these

emuon devices, sort othke those blocky, 5—pormd iPods ﬁom several
years ago that could hold 3.5 songs and had a 20-minute battery lite.
These Kindles allow you to download books in less than 60 seconds
as long as you have a cell phone signal, and one device can hold
hundreds of novels. Instead ofcarrying around an entire backpack
ofbooks, you can now just cany one KindleThe battery lasts for
weeks, unlike your laptop, and books are all dreaper, since you’re only
paying for a digital copy and no printing is involved. It saves costs for
the publishers and it helps cut down on needless uree killing.

There are some downsides though: rhe screen is pretty small,
and ifAIridzon or rho service goes under, you're out a lot orcash—
5360, to be exact. It takes a lot ofbooks to make up for dint initial
investment and start earning on the savings. But they're getting bet-
ter—Amazon’s Kindle 2 was recerrdy released, making some crucial
improvements on the rust version, and on Wednesday Amazon, in
coniunction widu The New YoIlemcs, will launch an even newer
vcrsiorr, with a much larger screen, designed to save the newspaper
industry. And did I mention this version is designed fol textbooks?

Now even die hookstoic is getting worried! Imagine downloads
rug all your textbooks onto one small, hghtrwcrght device. Then
imagine all mos-c same teatbooks that wergh down your back and
your soul costing less because they’re not in print. It's a beautiful
