Ferrier: self-proclaimed mom of Cleveland

Having just received a lrbraryr
visirarion, finals week snack (baby
carrots and part of a monster
cookie) from senior Evan Perrier,
it‘s not hard to believe that he
was known as rhc affecrronarely
as the “mom” of South carnpus's
Cleveland lounge,

“Even though i never smoked
cigarettes," Ferrler said, “so many
ofmy friends did,because I knew
rhem all from being in the lounge,
i'd always try ro admonish them,
or get them to stop smoking, or
ro put their crgaretre our in an
aslitlay, Stuff irke thar, making
sure people got plenty ofsleep . ..
I really was kind oflike a mom."

The poli sci major lived in the
dorm all rhrec years of his on-
campus life, moving ro u downr
[own apartment as a serum.

“1 ll\'Cd in Cleveland third,
randomly placed rlrerc," Ferrier
sard.“l started hanging our in the
lounge—we watched Jeopardy
every day, Ken Jennings was still
gorngrheu,so we'd go warcir hnn.
That's been a thing that's carried
over,”

Ferricr crrded up living on
Cleveland first, almosr by luck,
his second yeiir and remembers
meeirng a new group of Cleve-
land-dwellers,caring in the Quad

for 93 percent of his nrcals and
especially wurching Bravo rn the
lounges,

“Watching Proiecr Runway ..
that was a big thing My sec—
ond and third year, every dorm
in Jainaland would be watching
ploject runwayicleveland was
always packed."

This sense of community is

But it's also
something
he saw and
valued in the Grlnnell eomntur
niry and beyond.

“I did Grinnell in Washingr
ron fall of my junior year . . 1
really like the Gtinncll kids who
went and we lived in an apartr
meat complex wirh a bunch of
Swedish people," Ferrier sard,
“And Swedish people are so nice,
and so fun . . . it kind of makes
me want to visit Sweden."

Ferrier remembers rhe srranger
