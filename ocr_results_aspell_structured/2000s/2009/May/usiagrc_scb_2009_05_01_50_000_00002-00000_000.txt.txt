Iowa residents' suspected contractions Of swine ﬂu will

tor Torn Newton said Wednesday that an ill woman who
had recently returned from Mexico to her home in Iowa
exhibited the symptoms or the inﬂuenza strain that has
sickened citizens in ten states and countries on both sides
of the Atlantic “Now that we believe that the virus has
been introduced into the state, we anticipate it will spread
across lowa," Newton said.

even how I felt once south
campus was the only thing left,"

Wells beliwes that even though James is subrfrce, the
other south campus dorms will affect the dorms subrfrec
status.

“My roommates and 1 even thought about going tO
regular room draw once James was the only left," Wells
said. “Even to think that James is going to be sub—free,
Cleveland is still next door. I guess I will just have to get
used to the partying."

Others decided to return to sub—fret housing after
hearing James would be included.

“I’ve lived on Haines first before," said Adar-n Wcrt
'10. “1 like south campus, the location and the loggia, and
sort of the culture. But I like the feel of south campus
generally."

Wcrt doesn’t believe that a sub-free dorm located On
south will cause a culture clash on campus,

“I’m sure there will be some people who are in Cleve—
land who will be cursing the fact that James is now sub-
free, and I’m sure there are people in James who will smell
smoke coming down the loggia and will get angry about
that,” Wett said. “To me, in the spectrum of issues that
you hayc to deal with living with people that’s kind of
minor.

Despite the various criticisms from the student body,
Wert remains sure that the cultural values of being subr
free and south campus can corcxist with little conﬂict.

“1 think there’s space for a lot or things that are as-
sociated with south campus culture and with sub-free Cul-
ture. Especially because being subvfrec doesn’t necessarily
mean that you’re puritanical in all moral things," wcrt
said. “It’s saying that you aren’t going to use substances
in the dorms and you're going to do things responsibly
outside of the dorms,”

from p 1 unlawfully dismissed.

“They zoned it industrial and this
is not an industrial area out here at
all,” said Loretta Van Wyk, one of the plaintiffs in the
case. “So we feel there has been spot zoning and they only
zoned it industrial so that the ethanol plant could go in,
not because it made sense to zone it industrial out here,
but because they were doing it for one particular com,
rants"

Vernon van Wyk, another plaintiff, said that members
of the Board had not fully weighed ertizen concerns rn the
issue, “We had the opportunity lto vorcc concerns], but
the Board otsupervrsots, whrch is where this started, thcy
weren’t listening,” vcrnon van wyk said. “They were so
hellrbent on getting this monstrosity into our community
that they threw all caution to the wind."

In tho decision, the Court granted substantial defers
ence to the County Board's judgment, stating it would not
overturn the decision unless there was “clear evrdcnec" Of
impropriety. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged
that the Board had not adhered to all provisions regarding
public notice, it had acted in a way that substantially satis-
fred the intent of those provisions.

Richard Updcgrart, a Des Maines attorney represene
ing Big River in the case, without commenting on specie
ics of the case. said that the Com of Appeals decision
was largely cxpeeted,“1t was the County’s feeling and Big
River’s feeling that the supervisors .ollowed the right pro—
cedures to rezone and considered all relevant factors in
the decision to rezone,” he said. “[Thc decision] was no
surprise on our part."

Karl Knudsen, a Decorah lawyer representing the
plaintiffs, ﬁled a petition for further review in the Iowa
Supreme Court. Knudsen declined to comment on the
petition but said, “I certainly do hope that the Supreme
Court wrll grant further review and take a look at it."

The Clerk of courts Ofﬁce said the petition has yet to
be reviewed by the Court.

While the legal arguments involved in the Big River
suit hinged on issues of zoning and state open meetrng
laws, resident concerns extended tO broader fears about
the potential impact of the plant. These concerns ranged
from fears that water vapor emitted by the plant could
freeze on the highway, making tor treacherous driving
conditions to worries that rhe loo-gallon plant’s water
needs could lead to a local water shortage.

Ethanol, which is chieﬂy produced from Corn in the
Midwest, was once heralded as a boon to American energy
needs, that could simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and the country’s reliance on foreign oil. Re-
cently, though, the industry has come under attack for its

hefty government subsidies and low energy content. Some
critics contend that the fuels production—via sugar fer-
mentation and then distillation—actually produces more
net pollution than it saves as a substitute for fossil fuels.

The town ofGtinncll draws roughly 1.3 million gallons
of water daily from the Jordan Aquitcr, the underground
watcr reservoir which serves as the town’s water source. At
current consumption rates, the City expects the aquifer to
be depleted in ten to 50 years. According to a report by the
Institute for Agriculrurc and Trade Policy, producing one
gallon of ethanol requires, on average, foul gallons otwa-
ter. Based on natronal averages, the Big River plant would
consume a little over 1 million gallons ofwnter a day, close
to doubling the town’s daily water consumption.

Earlier this year, conservation groups and residents
in Eyota, Minn. sued to stop the construction ofa local
erhanol plnnr ovct concerns regarding the plant's environ-
mental impact, while earliet last month another plant in
Oshkosh,Wis. was sued for violating the Clean \Vatcr Act.

“Maybe the next generation of nuisance lawsuits will
involve ethanol plants, It's the same type of issues." said
Roger Mchwen, the Director ofthc Center for Agriculr
tural Law and Taxation at lowa State. “Potential Contamlr
nation of groundwater is a conccr noise is a concern and
trucks coming in and out or a plant and the assocratetl
decline or adjacent property values,"

“We are seeing fewer docketed cases at the trial court
lcvcl involving nuisance clarms againsr livestock Opera-
(ions, but we're starting to see them against ethanol plants
and wind energy companies," Mchwcn said. "So it's the
Same type or issue, its just a different type orderendant."

Grinncll City Manager Russ Behrcns, who helped
negotrare with Big River over the plant, said that while
alternative locations w'crc brieﬂy considered, the current
site had a number of advantages, including its proximity
to a highway, easy access to the electrical grid and, most
importantly, the ability to connect to the nearby Union
Pacific railway.

Bchrcris primarily cited economic issues as the reason
for rhe City's permission for rhe plant's construction. “Just
trying to provide a market for farmers for their commodi—
ties was probably one ofthe drivrng forces," said Behrcns.
Secondary to that would be the job creation directly It:-
lirted to the operation of the plant and the construction of
the plant."Tlie City even offered Big River a property tax
abatement as an additional incentive to locate nearby.

Before stumbling over the legal obstacles, Big River had
madc signiﬁcant progress at the development site. include
ing drilliuga well and conducting a number Ofengineering
feasibility studies and “grading" the land to ensure that it
is ﬂat and stable for both the plant and the extra railway.
