Redefining paper bags

Last weekend, Sabina ott, Artist in Residence and Profcsr
sor at Columbia college in Chicago, came to Grinneu to act as
a judge {or the 2009 smdent Art Salon.

Chris Farsrad '09 and I dragged ourselves out ofbed at 9:30
last Saturday to assist her as she selected pieces tor the salon,
which npens'this Friday at 4:15.

She burst in through the door at ten, full ofcncrgy and en-
thusiasm. bearing a rather peculiar set ofbrown paper bags. It
was quite a surprise, especially considering that we were blcaty-
eyed and in desperate need ofcoftee.

Shortly after introducing herself, and glancing around at
the gallery space, she set the bags down on the table and mo-
tioned us ovei to hei. “You gotta take a look at these,” she said.

They were ordinary piipcl bags—the kind that you would
find tit a grocery store. But instead ofa store name oi logo, the
words “I want to be ordinary"were printed on the outside.

Perhaps noticing the confused look on my face, Sabina
explained that the bags came from Industry of the ordinary

Kat‘York ’09
ART-U5.H_;€R

(IOTO), a Chicago artist’s collective. and asked me to look up
the website immediately

Industry of the ordinary conned in 2003.Their first perfors
mance took place in Daley Plaza in Chicago, where 75 particle
pants dropped exactly io3 pounds (the average weight of the
American adult) ofwhite clothing into the plaza from above

If you haven't guessed it from the name of the collective,
Industry of the ordinary is dedicated to highlighting the inter—
est to be had in everyday, ordinary items. In their online mani-
festo, they’ve written that they seek to explore and celebrate
“the customary, the everyday, and the usual, Their emphasis is
on challenging pejomtivc notions ofthe ordinary and, in doing
so, moving beyond the quotidian". There is beauty in banality
and that is the message that IOTO seeks to spread.

Sabina has some sort of connection to members of IOTO
and was able to provide Chris and I with tea bags, asking that
we take pictures of people interacting with them. For people
who are less wcllrconnected like you and me, IOTO will send
one to you ifyou agree to send a picture ofsomeone interact—
ing with the bags in any way they see fit. You can photograph
yourself staring at them, wearing them, putting them over your
head. Anything goes, really.

other projects are less straightforward. IOTO once used
craigslist (0 find a couple engaging in an extramarital affair.
They offered to pay for a romantic night at a hotel in exchange
for taking a portrait of the couple sitting together,

In an carlicr project, they collected signatures for a petir
tion against performance utﬂssentially doing a performance
piece to protest performance art. In yet another they sheared a
fur cost at the Hyde Park Art Center's opening while a crowd
of people looked on.

Their work is not strictly visual, however. Their website,
www.izxdmlryuﬁ‘lnovdinnvy.cum, has audio recordings of inter
views conducted with random people on the streets ofChicago.
They ask the interviewees to state what they believe in. Some
of the answers include: “God,"“Georgc W ush,"“myself,"“not
the government" and “sometimes my bike'

Industry of the ordinarywanrs to celebrate the mundane
and find interest not in the things they celebrate, but in the way
that they celebrate it. Or, rather, in the creativity inspired from
ordinary things. This is another one of those deals where the
process is much more important than the end product.

I’m planning on spreading these bags around a bit. Kind of
a last hurrah. A final interactive community art project before
(gasp) graduation. So if you see a paper bag that wants to be
ordinary lying around campus . . . pick it up, put it over your
head. Take a photograph and send it to industry of the Ordi—
nary. Most peoplcjust putgroceries in the bags . . , so it’s up to
you to find a way to be extraordinarily creative with an ordinary
old paper bag. ,

It’s been real nice writing for you all this year, Keep it real,
Grinncll. No limits to how exciting the ordinary can be here.

Mocking love stories with a love story

This year’s GIMP performances to be shown on the lawn of the JRC

BYBASSILALCHEIKII

This weekend, Giinnell Independent Musical Produc-
tions (GIMP) will celebrate its fifth year ofperformance with
its premiere of“The Fantasticks," the world’s longest running
musical which parodies love stories throughout history.

The tworpart musical tells the love story of Matt (Rose
Kory ’10) and Luisa (Kathleen Mul'ph)”GClSS '11) who, “Ros
meo and Iulict”sryle, come from two feuds
ing families. They fall in love and fight to
be together. overcoming hurdles [brought
out the musical. The obvious parallels
to the classic Shakespearean tragedy are
comcietcly intentional.

“It’s a love story itself, but it is also a
parody on stereotpyical love stories feature
ing two crazylovcrs,"dircctor BrockWebb
’09 explained.

The couple's mothers want the pair to

begin the quarrel intentionally.

“If there was no feud, the two would
not fall in love," actress Hannah Lytle ’11
said. "Hence, it’s a parody.”

The mothers hire actors in the story to separate Matt and
Luisa from each other, so that Matt may pursue Luisa further,
thus proving his love.

“While the first act ends happily, with the families reconr
cilcd and the lovers together, the second act brings a reality
that “takes the stars away from their cycs,“stage directorJosie
Gcrrictts ’10 said.

Matt explores the world, while Luisa lusts after the seduCr
rive El Gallo (Eamon Anderson '09). However, the musical
shows how the two eventually mature and fall in love with
each other again.

The second act also brings out significant changes in the
characters.

“The transformation occurs both in the couple’s relation-
ship, and in their personalities,” Murphy—Geiss said. “Luisa
changes from a self-centered person to being selfless."

“Matt goes out, sees the world, only to realize that all he
wants to do is settle down,” Kory said. “[He wants his] life to
be a story."

To maximize pleasure in preparing
the musical, Webb granted the cast a
significant amount offreedom.

“[Wehb’s] idea was to make it like a
street performance," Gerrietts said. “For
costumes, we’re going to Goodwill and
each actress and actor is supposed to buy
costumes that would fit their character
. . . We made sure that everyone got a
chance to express themselves."

The costumes should modernize a
musical that has been running nonstop
since the late 1950’s. Given its age, Ger-
rietrs found difﬁculty to adap the script
to suit a modern conception of political
correctness.

“When it was written, the authors tried to be politically
correct for that eia,"she said. “That's 50 years ago— today, the
original script is horribly politically incorrect!”

Regardless, or perhaps as a result, the premiere should be
enjoyable, as Webb has encouraged the actors to find some—
thing that will connect with the audience that can transcend
their stereotypes,

“Try to find the humanity in each stereotypical character,”
Webb advised. “It makes the laughs valuable."
