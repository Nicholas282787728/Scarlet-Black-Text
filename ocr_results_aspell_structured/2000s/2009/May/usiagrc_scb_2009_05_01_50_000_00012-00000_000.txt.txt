Carlos Lu ‘IO gives advice about growing older and moving up in the Grinnell class hierarchy

Can you believe its May already.> That's
right, May, which means that as the tempera
ture outside goes up, the academic year winds
down. Before you know it, it's finals Week,
aka. the week of intense snidying and no
sleep, or for some of you, the week of intense
partying and no sleep (pick your poison). Next,
it's Block Party and you’re pouring beer into
a Solo cup from the side ofa truck on High
street and posing for pictures with state troop-
ers.Then it's summertime and the living’s easy.

And for those of us who aren’t seniors, who
aren’t graduating and entering the real world,
after summer comes a new academic year at
Grinncil College. A new year means a new
class of Grinnellians who don‘t quite know
just how awkward they really are (or will be).
A new year means new living quarters, new
routines, and, hopefully, new friends.

But the craziest thing about a new year
is that you won’t be a first-
year/second—yent/juniot
anymore. You’ll be a see
ondryear/jurtior/seniorl Ah!
Transitions! Growing up!
Maturityl Coming of age!
Etc.,etc.,etc.l

To the ﬁtsl’rycal'57conr
gramlationsl You've made it through one of
the most awkward and exciting years ofyour
life. This fall, you'll come back to Grinnell
with a different set of feelings than you had
last August. You’ll actually know people, you’ll

know where to go on the first day of classes,
and, hopefully, you'll know the meaning of
selfrgovernance.

The summer before my second year, I
was convinced that second year was going to
be the best one at
Grinnell. My logic
ms that a) your
coming back to all
of your friends and s
familiar faces, b) A
you're whole class ,
will be here for the
whole year, c) you're not going to be graduate
ing at the end of the year, and d) you're not a
ﬁrst'year.

Although all of those criteria are true, I’ve
realized that they don’t necessarily equate
to the “best year at Grinncll." Don’t get me
wrong, I had a great time my second year, and
I’m sure that when it’s all said
and done, some ofyou Will reflect
on these four years and pick the
second one as your favorite.

But there’s definitely some-
thing that happens after second
year, when you become a junior
and enter the realm of upper
classmen. It’s the point where you start to
ally forgetting the excitement and ease ofhigh
school, you start taking higher level courses,
and begin preparing for the real world. Your
hand definitely isn't being held anymore.

are”

Most of you current secondryeats will be
abroad for a semester next year. You’ll be in
a place completely foreign, away from your
friends, family, and Grinnell.You‘ll have ample
opportunity to grow as a person, to discover
things about
yourself and do
things that you
never thought
you would do. At
Grinnell, you’ll
probably have a
single—if you're
one of the lucky ones to get one before they
ran out—~and the chances are that you’ll have
a lot of questions for yourself: "Wait, I have a
space all to my own? I have to go out and ac:
tively find my friends to hang out with them?
I’m about to be 21?Those are the first-years?!”

These were the type of questions Iwas asks
ing myself at the beginning of this semester.
These questions are really important. Even
though you soon-to-be-juniors will probably
have questions of your own, it’s the way that
you answer these questions that makes you
an upperelassman, And do you want to know
what the beauty ofeollcge is? You don't have to
answer those questions alone.

It’s May. To all of the seniors, good luck in
the real world. To all of my fellow classmates,
let's have a ballin’ senior year, And let's help
those who don't have all of their questions ans
swered yet.

Fond memories from a graduating Grinnellian

Rachel Fields ’09 shares some embarrassing stories from her four years as a student at Grinnell

I’m graduating in two weeks, and I am terr
rifledl know the real world might be awesome
and full of adventures and that, realistically, the
rest of my life won’t suck, but I don’t care. In
my mind, leaving from Grinnell is the sequel
to leaving the wombiBirth 2: Electric Boon
galoo. I'm pretty sure that outside Grinnell,
you can't sit in the sun for six hours at a time,
do all manner of illegal things without suffer-
ing the consequences, and use the words “her
gemony" and “postrstructutalism” in the same
sentence. WTF.

I knowit seems like everysenior is whining
about this tight now, but doing all these things
for the last
time is just
really weird.

Evcn now,

typing this,

I'm think-

ing, "Man,

is this the last time I'll use the publications
office to write a column that was due several
dnys ago?"

Because if this is my last column, then I’d
like to tell you a few stories. (Wow, it's amaZr
ing how you can actually hear people turning
to the next newspaper page through the space-
time continuum.) Keep in mind that at least
one of these stories is really horribly embar-
rassing. Whatever. I’ve never been one to pres
tend that I'm cool. And ifyou're sitting there
shaking your head and wanting to convince
me otherwise, oh-ho, read on.

FitstYear

once upon a time, Quid was a dining hall,
candy was only a penny, dinosaurs roamed out:
side and I was a foolish lirstryear. Sometime
during my first months at Gtinnell, I was in
the dining hall for breakfast when I spotted
some delicious bacon, “Mmm, delicious bar
con,"I thought “If only thtre was something
even more delicious, like that piece of French
toast they considerately placed under the ba-
con for me to eatl” Unbeknownst to me, the
“French toast” was actually a piece of bread
that had been sitting under the bacon for
hours, soaking up the fat until it was literally
sopping wet] took it back to my table, took a
bite, and immediately understood my mistake.

it was probably the second worst decision I’ve
ever made~the first being taking three more
bites before I decided really, no, this isn't food,
I'll get something else.

Second Year

Deep breath. Okay, here we go. In the
spring of my second year, I was in a mainstage
production that I won't name. It had a lot of
elaborate costumes and long singing numbers,
and I had a small part as a woman who was
drunk most of the time. The night of our fr
nal perfoimance fell on Disco, I had it bottle
of vodka handy, and since my character was
dnmk anyway , . , well, you probably get my

drift. it was probably one of

the more snipid things I‘ve

ever done, a fact that been

came clear as soon as I (let

cided to go to the bathroom,

I got into the stall,

pulled down my elaborate

eosnune, peed, thought, “Sweet, I’m done peer

mg," pulled up my costume, realized I had

been wrong in my previous a ment, and t

. . again, you probably get my drt t. Drunkenly

mortified, I scnmpeied to the costume studio

and told them that, um,l was going to need

a new costume And if you think that people

take kindly to you telling them you peed on

your costume because you were drunk during
the production,wel.l , ..

Third Year

Fall of my third year, I went abroad to
Grinncllrianondon, which, if you're consid-
ering going abroad, is basically the best thing
ever. seriously, go. Right now. Don’t even wait
for the program to start. Anyway, one night
my friend had ‘tI few drinks and decided (for
a reason I still don't understand) to throw a
bottle ofwine ofIthe roofofour building. For-
tunately we didn’t become accidental murder
ers; unfortunately, a woman saw the bottle and
chased us down from the roof, shouting, “You
stupid girl! You stupid, stupid girll" in a scary
British accent.

The next day, we saw there was a letter
under our landlord's ofﬁce door and ﬁgured it
was about our antics on the roof "We have to
get that letter,"l said, Queen of Foresight that
I am. so I grabbed the only long, flat objectl

could findiwhich happened to be a HUGE
BUTCHER KNIFEiand headed down-
stairs with my friend. We were standing there,
about to put the knife under the door, when
we looked up at the corner and saw a secu:
my camera, Pointing at us. And our butcher
knife, Hmmm, we thought, this looks really
bad. Also, isn’t tampering with mail a federal
offense, now that we come to think of it? Let
us never speak of this again.

Senior Year

Sometime in the fall, my friends and I were
hanging out on their balcony when we spot-
ted a mysterious white object in the midtlle
of the road. None of us could tell what it was,
so we sent it member of the group to investi:
gate. While sht was gonc,l made the mistnkc
of going to the bathroom, allowing all kinds
oftrieksy business to happen behind my back.
When I returned, they all looked distraught.
”Rachel, it’s ii rem-1 Hi In! bend," my friend said
“It’s lying in the middle of the road and its
body is nowhere to be found."‘I—Iow liortlﬁcl’I
thought ‘The most horrificl’

They insisted that we go downstairs and
look at it, and the whole time I was prepare
ing for the worst. “Would we have to move it?"
I thought frantically. What‘s the protocol for
finding halfa eat body in your neighborhoodﬂ
COLLEGE HAS TAUGHT ME NOTI-l:
ING. I'm ashamed to think of how close we
were before I realized: it was a cup. An empty
soda cup. Not a severed cat head. I actually still
feel stupid about this. A cat head. Really.

If there's an overarching theme to these
stories, it's probably that I run an idiot. But
that's the great thing about Grinnell: it gives
you the chalice to be an idiot in a place full
of amazing people who won't judge you and
will only occasionally trick you into thinking
that objects are other objects. sttre, I’m going
to miss ARH, Disco, and the dining hall car-
rot cake, but mostly I’m sad to be leaving all of
you. You have made the last four years so unr
believably fun and awkward and wonderful. I
couldn't have become the person I fun without
you, and since I’m clearly rhe kind of person
who writes about peeing on herselfin a public
forum,I think we've both accomplished a lot,
