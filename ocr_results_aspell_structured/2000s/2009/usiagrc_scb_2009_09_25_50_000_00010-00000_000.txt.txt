Having fun isn’t hard when You’ve got a library card

Cozying up to Stewart library as it gets ready to take the name Drake and live happily ever after on Park Street

VISUAL ZING THE

BYALI SARGENT

Buried up to your nose in textbooks, aca-
demic journals and several thousand page, seve
eml hundred year old classics, it is easy to for
get the days when going to the library meant
hearing the Lotax read out loud, or picking a
stack ofBailey School Kids books to complete
the summer reading challenge. Luckily we
have the Stewartﬁoon to become Drakei
community library to remind us that having
your nose stuek in a book is a good thing.

Since Burling and Kistle ﬁll the positions
of town academic libraries, Stewart is able to
focus on what it does bestefostering commu-
nity. “It’s more than just books. community
center is really how we envision it,"Monit1ue
Shore ’90, Systems Administrator, sai “we
make a very conscientious effort to be friendly
and inviting and helpful and nice.”

The library offers a mriety of program—
ming for school-age children, including Inul'
riple storytiliies and special events that bring
together stories, music, puzzles and crafts to
support and inspire young readers. They also
offer a weekly book delivery service to local
retirement communities, ensuring everyone in
Grililiell access to booksilncluding Gtinnell
students.

“They come and read, you know, fun free
tion. Stuffyou don’t get much of," Shore said,
She noted that while many college students
use the library (over 50 percent have cardsi
see graphic) there is always an inﬂux right be
fore a breakwhen students come in to pick up
audiobooks for their long travels.

Built in 1901,thc library was designed and
funded by Joel Stewdtt, a farmer, banker and
state legislatot.Tlic ﬂoor of the main level is
made of three-inch glass, and [l]: shelves run
straight through it. “It's foggy, so you can't
look up somebody's dress,” Shore said.

such umqllt: features will not go to waste,
as the building will be inherited by the
Glinnell Area Arts Council when the library
moves into its new location during the month

ofoctober. The stewart building will keep its

name alid be transformed into an arts center
complete with a performance space and post
sibly a basement pottery studio with its own
kiln.

The grand opening of the Drake library is
scheduled for Nov. 2, and excitement at SthT
art is palpable. And the best part about the
new space is, well, spaceThc cozy little library
has been so crowded for so long that for every
new book added they had been forced to get
rid ofan older book. “We do regular weeding,"
Shore said.

The library's new home at 930 Park St. will
allow some of the lion-invasive weeds to stick
around a little longer, and hopefully allow for
the planting of more new literary ﬂowers as
well. “We always wish we had more,” Lolna
Caulkins, library director said, “but it’s a good
collection."

caulkins, who is in charge of selects
ing which titles will be added to the coiled
tion, uscs speCllilized library review journals,
requests from the public and her own creole
lent judgment to make decisions. “We have
a big emphasis on our children's collection,"
Caulklns said. “We have to tespond to all of
the fevers." she added, justifying the library's
multiple copies of the Twilight series.

Other more Iowa»specific fevers hit the li-
btaty each year thanks to the All Iowa Reads
program, ’uJIHﬂJ inmate"rerﬁrthebwkerg/aiv, in
which each year a statewide committee choos-
es a book that all Iowans are encouraged to
read and discuss, This year's selection is “The
Rope walk" by Carrie Brown, a coming of age
story documenting a pivotal summer in the life
of 10-year-old New England small town girl.

If there is any place to get book recomr
mendarions, it is from a librarian, “I've been
reading a lot of things on astronomy," Shore
said. Shore is preparing herself for the travoh

this theory to the test and see what Stewart

then again, maybe we shouldn't read too much

Jumi Bella: What prompted you to study genes pertaining to hut
man behavior?

Dean Homer: I think it was why I’ve studied gen 1
ncsies all my life. It got to a certain point in cime j
where id done my basic research and I was looking
for something mat would have more social impor-
tance and it was at that same time that the Human
Genome Project really started...so you could really
do something signiﬁcant with behavior genetics. so

I put those two things togedicr and decided to do i
that.

Bello:With all this research, you madc ﬁndings on in types 0(ch
havioral geneticsﬁemtonin trmisporters. dopamine and how it re-
httes to anxiety/depression and even the “gay gellet”Wh:\t was your

motivation for pursuing this line ofscientiiic research?

Homers I drink that, you know, almost everyone who is a biologist
thinks that all these traits have some biological underpinning. What
was novel about what I did was to say, “0k lct's apply the technolr
ogy we have and study something like sexual orientation,”antl most
people would shy avlmy from stuﬂr like that because it’s too queer or
too gay or too weird or something like that. So it wasnt really so
much of a theory as the willingness to look at something that a lot of
people ind not investigated at all before,

Bello: Your willingness to look at something that had not been in-
vestigated before produced some findings that were very ground-
breaking for the scientiﬁc world as well as the queer theory arena.

How did people react when you started publishing your ﬁndings?

Harrier: The reacuons were very mixed.They ranged from absolute
total ecs : “This is wonderful, this is great," to: "You’re some kind
of Hitler madman who's going to be deseroying gay people forever."
It was very, very vancd,l would sayThe only people who would be
consistently against it were the real nghtawingers who don’t want
anyone to think that being gay is anything other than a bad choice

that pcoplc make. But other people who were on

, both sides saw things both ways.

Bello: What about your more current hypotheses

. on outer behavioral genes.> You wrote something in
2004 called “The God Gene" and you were talking
about how there is a God gene for the religious ox-
patience,

Humor: That's actually not a gone. It's not really for

‘ religion or for God, it's more for the feelings ofspiri-

tualitythat pcoplc haveAnd we have this theory that

spirituality again is a pcrsonaliry trait that is variable. some people
rcnd to be morc spiritual and others less so.

Bella: What led to this publication?

l-lam - l’mjust fascinated with how important religion has become
in American society. Ir made me wonder why it was so important
and as a biologist, I wondered whether there were biological roors,
There’s been a fair amount of research suggesting that there's some
sort ofbiological root to spirituality and we decided to test that.

In fact, what the research looks Like is that this tendency towards
spirituality does have some sort of innate component, whereas m,
ligion itself is purely culture and has no biologyl also realized that
hat is very at the outer edge ofwhat biology can rcally study in a
truly scientiﬁc wayl think the research is valid but is sort ofpushing
are limits ofhow much you can study through biology

Bello: so with all diis research and publications you’ve made over
the years, you managed to produce a ﬁlm called out OfThe Silence,
which is the story of queer people in rural communities. How did
you manage to ﬁnd time to do this?

Hamer. That’s a good question. Well, as you see, it's about some:
thing that‘s important to me and my partner and I felt like some:
body had to document it. And since nobody was going to do it for
us,vvc just decided to do it ourselves and we just starred ﬁlming.

We'd go to Oil City, this small town, on weekends or [or a cou-
ple ofdays at a time and film while we are there and stretch dint out
for a couple ofycars and now it’s a movie Moviemaking is a skill
in and of itself as I’ve discovered. It requires dedication and a lot of
collabomcion with other people.

we've also been very fortunate to be able to work with some very
talented people. we got support from the sundance insntutbwe
got two big grants from the sundancc Institute. We applied for the
gmne and it’s much harder to get a Sundance grant than an NIH
[National Institutes of Health] grant. It’s like a thousand applica-
tions for 10 spots, but we had an intcro g story and that was er-
tremely helpful.

Bella: Has the movie been well received since it has been produced?

Hauler: It’s just beg-inning now and we‘re beginning our outreach
tour. It’s bccn cxncmely well received. We just heard from the
American Bar Association who wants to use it to train their laws
ycrs all oval the counurACLU [The American Civil Liberties
Union] is going to use it, the Holocaust Education Council is going
to use it and you’ll see it’s because it really sort of shows both sides of
the debate that's going on.

It’s hopeful and optimistic. it has got a lot ofqualiucs mat most
gay documentaries don’t have because it Lties to really show both
sides and I think that makes a big difference. I think it's a tool that
can go beyond prcadiing to the choir and bring two people together
and discuss these issues—I hope.
