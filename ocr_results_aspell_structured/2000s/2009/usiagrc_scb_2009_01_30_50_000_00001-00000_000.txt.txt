approiimately $240,000 from its 52.5 million
budget, a decrease ofnear-ly 10 percent,

to Dining's directors

Dining has implemented new, more lim-
ited hours for the Grill in order to reduce costs.

Assistant Director of Dining Services Mary
Kirk said."l didn't want to [raise prices], so the
only other place was to cut hours. "

Last semester, the Grill opened at 10 a rn
on Saturdays and closed at 2 a. m. on Fridav
and Saturday nights. Now the Grill will not
open until 1 p. m. on Saturdiis and will close
