Noise now regulated by police

By DEVIN Ross

The Grinnell City Council has decided to
play librarian by voting to implement a giant
‘shhhl' to the citizens of the Grinnell in the
form ofa new noise ordinance,

The ordinnnce, passed and approved by
the Grinnell City Council Nov. 2. enacts
provisions to prevent excessive sound that is
perceived as hazardous to the public health
and welfare ofthe residents.

Discussion of the noise ordinance first
appeared iii the council‘s minutes from Oct.
5, which cited a meeting held by the council
on Sept, 22.

According to Chief of Police Jody
Mathcrly, before discussion of the new
ordinance began, only two laws regulated
noise levels in city limits orGrinnell,

"There were only two laws on the booksi
one was a stare law that said you can’t make
loud or reckless noise near residents." Chief
Matherly said. “That helped sometimes with
loud music or something in a residential area.
The other law was for loud motor vehicles."

As stated in_the ordinance, measurements
of sound will be made with a decibel meter
that meets the American National Standards
Institute and will be taken from the edge
of a city street, an alley rightsofsway or the
location from which the complaining party
was disturbed

Decibel levels set by the ordince will be
mnsidered excessive and arel
be subject to regulation. In

' residential areas, between the
hours of7 a.m. and midnight,
a reading exceeding 60
decibels will give police the
authority to issue a warning
or citation. In a commercial or
agricultural zone, sound may
not exceed 65 decibels, which
is equivalent to conversational
speech. Readings in ndustrial
zoned areas may not go over
80 decibels, which is equivalent to the noise
level inside ora traveling bus.

Breaking the ordinance can result in a ﬁne
of up to 500 dollars and a couple afdnys in
jail, according to ChiefMatherly.

In order to determine what sound levels
would be acceptable for Grinnell, Chief
Motherly referred to the sound ordinance of
Ames, Iowa.

“They are also a college town and are
sensitive to the fact that there are....parties."
Matherly said. “We want the kids to enjoy
themselves."

Mayor orthe City ofGrinnell Gordon R.
Canfield said that the immediate need for the
noise control is a fairly new occurrence.

“it’s a new thing we've never had to
have it before but were starting to get more
complaints about loud noises," Canfield
said. “It isn't so much about one time having
something happen"

James White, member of the Grinnell
City Council since January 1986 and owner or
Bates Flowers believes that the need to enact
a noise ordinance originated from complaints

by citizens about certain businesses in town.

“We had some neighbors that were
complaining," White said. “As council
members we were called in the middle of the
night, with complaints of loud noises from
bars."

Fellow councilman Larry Wilson, a
member of the Public Safety Committee
within the City
Council for
approximately
10 years, cites
a particular
establishment
for causing the
push behind
the ordinance.

“The main
reason is The
9th Hole
opening up
and the residential area getting all the noise,"
Wilson said.

The 9th Hole, located at 310 6th Ave.,
west of Highway 146, opened in April of
2008,was one ofthe bars to receive continuous
objections to nose from residences in the area.

“Neighbors were continuously calling in
complaints of noise," said Jerry O'Halloran,
owner of The 9th Hole. “We are in a
residential area and some of the residents
don’t really like us there."

O'Halloran believes that by passing the
ordinance the council is simply doing what
they need to in order to keep the residents of
Grinnell content

"The City Council is doing what they
need to do to pass their constituents,"
O'Halloran said

Due to his bar's noise zone, O'Halloran
doesn’t foresee any problems arising from the
ordinance code.

“We’ve actually taken decibel readings.
We’re in an industrial area so 65 decibels
won’t affect us at all,” O’Halloran said. “We
could be much louder than we are now. [The

James White

ordinance] could be more of a detriment to
the people who keep calling in than any help
to them. It doesn’t affect us that much.“

Though the noise ordinance will apply
to all parts of the city, Chief or Police Jody
Matherly believes that this will not be
problematic for the current college campus
atmos here

his wasnt even geared toward the
college atmosphere. It was geared tomrd
businesses," Chief Marherly said. “The
college neighborhood area is pretty easy to
control.We don't get a lot ofnoise complaints
with the College."

Director of Campus Security and
Safety at Grinnell College Stephen Briscoe
doesn’t think that the new ordinance will be
detrimental to the College.

"It’s more ofa city ordinance, so they will
probably do what they have donhthey can
either respond to [the complaint] or give us a
call and we can respond to them when its on
campus," Briscoe said. "We're just in the city
and the ordinance covers that.”

Though sanctioned tor various reasons,
the law is not just geared toward one type
of noise.

“[The ordinance] doesn’t just look at
bars, doesn't just look at kids congregating,
it doesn't just look at outside bands," White
said, “It’s kind of an overall, general noise
ordinance that could be music, cars, talking.
whatever."

Although a well defined noise ordinance
may seem daunting, those interviewed
stressed the overall goal is much less about
targeting certain groups as it is concerned
with providing a peaceful environment for
the entire population ofGrinnell.

"We want to make sure if someone's
peace and tranquility is being disturbed, we
can help them with that and this is a tool to
help them with that,” Chief Motherly said
“It’s important for sanity reasons."

Slow Foods Grinnell brings out the brewer in all of us

By CHRISTAIN CAMINITI
On Saturday, Nov. 14, Slow Foods Grinnell hosted a
homebrewing demonstration at Heritage Farms. In celebra-
tion of National Teach a Friend to Homebrew Day, which is
held annually on the first Saturday in November, Brooks Davis
’ instructed an eclectic mix of students, local families, and fellow
farmers on the nuances ofconcocting a tasty barley pop,

In the fashion of a home cooking show, Davis had asseme
bled a condensed homebrewing production line in the farm-
house which moved chronologically, beginning with an empty
rive gallon bucket and concluding with the anal product—a
replication ofthe delicious Dead Mans Ale, brewed by Rogue
Brewery in Portland, Oregon.

With the eager group of beer novices surrounding him, Da-
vis began his demonstration by fielding the most immediate
question—'although it’s called homebrewing, is it really pos

sible or practical to homebrew at home?’ The unmitigated an-
swer is ‘yes.‘

Althougli it may be intimidating, Andrew Dunham, the
owner and operator of Heritage Farms, sees many benefits to
practice ofmaking your own brew.

“[Homebrewing is] easy, fun and the end result is delicious,"
said Dunham. “I think most people would really enjoy if they
found the time to get into it."

Even though Davis was working with equipment one
likely will not find in his or her own kitchen, all that is really
essential for the successful concocting of a beer with a ﬁve
percent alcoholic content is an electric stove and two and
half gallon bucket.To put that five percent number into some
perspective, Busch lite has about a 4.2 percent alcohol content
while Hawkeye Vodka can claim 40 percent, making your beer
somewhere in that comfortable gap

Ifyou'rc feeling particularly ambitious in your beer-making,
causing you to seek tools other than make shift home appliances
in constructing your unique brew, Davis suggests picking up a
starter kit from the accommodating Urbandale, IA store—Beer
Crazy. A homebrewing kit costs about $75. For that price you
get fermentors, spigots, a hydromcter, airlock‘ and stopper,
bottle filler. racking cane, tubing, bonle brush, bottle caps and
a bottle capperimore or less everything you need besides the
actual ingredients and a group offricnds.

lfyou need some guidance in utilizing your new equipment
you can also pick up the highly recommended "How to Brew"
by John Palmer or -“The complete Joy of Holnebrewing"
by Charles Papazian. These books provide a specific and
helprul outline for the aspiring homebrewer, as well as a ﬁne
introduction to the key ingredients, which can also be bought
at Beer Crazy
