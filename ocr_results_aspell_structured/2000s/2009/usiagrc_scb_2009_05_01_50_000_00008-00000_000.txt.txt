Disability awareness

5v ALYSIA VALLAS

Since the creation of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) of 1991, Grinnell College has taken steps towards
making the campus a more accessible place for people with
disabilities. In order to achieve this goal, the College finc-
tuncd its philosophy regarding future renovation and construc-
tion. and also developed the Disability Awareness Committee,
comprised of both faculty and students, “for the purpose of
initiating awareness, education,
curricular enhancement, ICCIUKT
merit, and retention on campus for
persons with disabilities and the
Grinnell College community.”

\Vliilc these developments are
a step towards a more accessible
Gi'innell, to further consolidate
and streamline efforts the College
established the Accessibility Conic
mittec this past year, The Commit
tee is comprised of administrators
and faculty, with Jennifer Krohn as
the new Senior Research Associate.

To date, almost all buildings on
campus have been modified in some way to make them more
compatible with wheelchair access. This process has been
made easier by the largerscalc construction of new buildings
across campus in the past few years including the Joe Rosenr
flcld Center, Bucksbaum Center for the Arts, the Chrystal
Center, East Campus residence halls, and the additions to the.
Noyce science center.

While modifying old academic buildings and dormitories
has proven to be more difficult, ramps and accessible door
openers have been added to many of the existing structures,
students may have noticed recent additions such as ramps
along the north campus loggia, mechanized doors on Burling
Library and the bookstore and renovations to both Faculty
and Nollcn House.

“You can meet the code but is that what we call friendly?"
Krohn said. “Not necessarily," These modiﬁcations to make
campus spaces more compatible are to provide comfort and
simply make differently abled students lives easier This in-

to modify student lounges, and smaller things, like the height
and structure of toilet paper dispensers.

In order to make certain their progress is efficient, the
group has consulrcdwith scorr Lissncr,an expert in the field of
student accommodation and disability school policies. “When
he crimc last time [in 2007] he looked at some of our facilities
with a group of us," l<rohn said. “He walked us through and
taught us techniques so we could go and get an idea ofwlrnt
we were looking for"

The committee plans to have
L' ietiiin in June so that he
can look more speciﬁcally at the
College‘s policies and procedures,
This would give the College the
opportunity to moie uniformly
present the accessibility options
available. “There are some things

we as an institution need to say to
all students,‘lfyou have a d' . rliry
and you need assistance,her vho
you can contact,"Y Krohn said. “We
have to say it in academics, and athr
leties. and housing, and dining, and
student activities so that all these programs are accessible."

Via the College website. the Accessib ity Committee has
made available what resources are available for students or
visitors with disabilities. The website provides its visitors With
a campus accessibility map, the dining. housing, and transport
ration services available and also photographs of the newly
purchased accessible van which currently resides outside the
Health Center.

Beyond wheelchair accessibility, accommodations are
available for other disabilities as well. For people who are
lrearingrimpaircd, the College offers closedrcaptioned coir
vocations, in addition to sign language interpreters at major
events and various microphone devices for professors during
class Also. assistive technology is available such as Kurzwell
software that manages Internet functions for people with vir
sual impairments. While the college offers vario ~ technolm
gies, equipment is purchased on a studentrneetl h is.

“Its hard because each need is individual, and we need
to look .it each case and see what works best, said Karen

McRitchie ofITS.

This philosophy works well according to Patrick Comp a—
tin '13, who navigates campus in a motorized scooter. “What
I like about Grinnell is that they're very good at listening to
what you have to say and adapting and making changes, esper
eially FM." Comparin said.

While thc College has made large efforts towards making
Grinncll accessible, the administration as well as students see
plenty ofroom for improvement. For example, buildings such
as rhc Forum, areas of Burling Library and Mears Cottage
are still dccrticd inaccessible. Unfortunately, some buildings
cannot meet ADA standards without undergoing large tenor
vatioii projects or- being destroyed and rebuilt. Additional man
'or construction plans, ncvcrthclcss, are not currently possible

ording to budget constrictions with the current economic
ct

others believe there can be improvement outside of coin
structlon projects such as awareness and discussion about dist
abilities or more accommodations for events. Compari ii noted
the lack of accessibility into residence halls that host meet-
ings and also the inconsistency in where some major events
are held.

Leah Krandel ‘09, a member of the Disability Awareness
Committee, noticed for example, “I was at the University of
Iowa and something that really struck me was I saw a sign for
a regular activity and at the bottom it said ‘Ifyou need special
accommodations, please contact us here.’ And 1 was thinking,
we could totally do that, that would make such a huge differ-
ence." Other small accommodations suggest including signs
directing visitors to accessible entrances, bathrooms, and other
key locations, which is a point Krohn is taking seriously into
consideration.

Future plans for campus improvement include demolishing
and rebuilding Burling Library and renovating the preschool,
Norris, ARH, Meats and the ﬁrStTﬂOOK of Faculty House.

Furthermore, to foster discussion and awareness, the Dis~
abillty Awareness Committee plans to have a symposium in
Sept 2009 and welcomes more students to its group. While
progress is being made, Krohn admits there rs work to be done.
“We’re not perfect, but accessibility is definitely a priority and
we re working hard to make Grinnell accessible."

Students help prisioners write one- -act plays

BY CHLOE MORYL

For Caitlin Davies ’09 and Emma Silverman ’09, this 56»
mesrer's Tuesdays have consisted ofelass, playing Mario Party,
and teaching incarcerated adult students theatre and playwrit»
Ingr

Davies, a theatre major, had previously taught an acting
class at Newton Prison, and wanted to get involved in the play-
writing class. Since Silverman had a strong writing background
and is a good friend ofDavies, the two figured they’d be a per
fect fit to reach playwriting together.

As this is their second semester teaching playwriting to—
gether, the structure of their class has changed over the year—
last semester, Davies and Silverman focused more on different
plays throughout history Now, as their students are writing
short 5-10 minute one-act plays they've used more contempor
rary plays as models.

They re more models ofthc type ofwork that we are hope
ing that they would do, Davies said. I think that they get much
better model oflength and art ofstory and the oneract plays are.
very different from a full-length play You write in one setting.
you write in one time, whereas full plays have scenes and acts."

Though studying oncracr plays is helpful for the plays prior
oners will be producing, many have expressed interest in other
theater, specifically Shakespeare. “we brought in a few videos
of‘Romeo and Juliet’ because some of them aren’t quite at thc
point where they could just really read the text alone and one
derstand all ofit," Davies said.

The film versions ranged from the more classic adaptations

to Baz Lurhmans version, starring Leonardo Dicaprio. we
also printed them out some ‘Romeo and Juliet’ synopses and
that served as a guide," Silverman said, “And they had the op-
portunity to read the full text ifthcy wanted—there's a copy in
the llbrary."

Additionally, with a semester already under their belt, the
stress present in the initial classes has subsided with time.

“A lot of times at the beginning of the course we stressed
about, ‘Okay, what is our plan going to be today, what are we
going to do?’ but honestly, sometimes the days that we don’t
really have anything planned are the days that we have the best
discussions,” Silverman said. “We talk about the plays, we talk
about theatre, but like it happens much more organically and I
think we get to hear more from them."

The discussions in class range from analyzing assigned one-
act plays to improv exercises.

“One ofthe usual parts ofthc structure of our class is im—
prov exercises," Silverman said. “They have the best time with
them and they’re all just really good actors and you know it’s
sort ofa fun, informal way to introduce a topic," Silverman said.

Both Davies and Silverman feel that this informality lends
itselfto an environment in which the prisoners are comfortable
talking about anything, from their families to their hopes upon
release

“We come in and instead of being this hero figure that
George Drake is,wc kind ofgo in as their peers and it's an hour
and a half for them to talk to someone that's on the outside
and really will respect what they say and we use the plays that

they re writing as a forum for ideas, Davies said. To reach
them about playwriring is just giving them a channel to erpress
themselves."

After an entire semester of classes, writing, and editing,
Griiincll College students will put Newton prisoners' plays to
life. Davies and Silverman contacted friends, theater majors,
and those who are involved with various Grinnell productions
to get a good basis ofactors for the prison plays.

Mitch Avitt ’10, who directed Nevcrland Players this 5:-
mesrer,jumpcd at the opportunity to participate.

“I've like heard about the prison plays going on for a long
time but this is the first time that I sort of have a free chunk of
time that I can invest in this and it seems like a really worth-
while opportunity,"Avitt said. “I'm not sure what I’m going to
get out of it, but I think I’ll get something that’ll change my
outlook a little bit."

The plays will be performed atthe prison on Thursday, May
7. “We’re hoping to get about 150 people at the prison, which
would include volunteers and staff, which I think is the most
that they’ve ever had," Davies said.The plays will also be per
formed on Friday, May 8 at the Wall,

With several semesters of teaching experience in the prison
program. both Davies and Silverman are sad to be departing
the program, as they plan to graduate this May.

“ifyou teach at the prison you’ll develop in a strange way.
you will develop friendships and meet unique, wonderful peor
pie," Silverman said. “I think that I will probably cry more on
our last day ofclass than I will at graduation."
