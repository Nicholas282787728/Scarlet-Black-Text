Homebrewers
share tricks
of the trade

BY CHKlsTlAN CAMINITI

on Saturday you can expand your measly
beer LQat Heritage Farm where Slow Foods
Grinnell will be holding a Homebrewing
Demonstration from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m.

In celebration of the international Home-
brewing Holiday, held annually on the ﬁrst
Saturday of November, our local chapter or
the nonprofit educational organization, Slow
Foods, Will be ———
instructing in
the ﬁne arts
of ferment-
ing, mashing
and, ofcourse,

”You can go from scratch
to drinking in as few as
ﬁve to ten day!

potential in-
! o x i c a t i o n
isn't incentive
enough to
make it out to the farm, consider some other
worthwhile attributes of homebrewing that
are less damaging to your internal organs. For
starters, there is the simplicity ofit

“You can go from scratch to drinking in as
few as ﬁve to ten days,“ Neal Wepking '10, who
spent a summer brewing wine in Eco House,
said. “Admittedly though, our experiments
found varying degrees of success When done
right though, you can make something better
than 50 percent ofwhat’s on the market, And
90 percent of what's at McNally’s,"

Unsurprisingly, the prospect of a homer
brewing demonstration has been met with
some enthusiasm from the student body.

“It sounds pretty sweet,” said Alec Moore
’11, who agrees that homebrewed beer is not
only better tasting than the usual Busch Lite,
but also signiﬁcantly more interesting. Taylor
Lieuwen ’11 expressed a similar sentiment,

“It’s something I'd love to learn how to
do. Grinnellians should brew more at home,"
said Lieuwen.

So whether it is in support of the Slow
Foods movement, in celebration of the In-
ternational Homebrewing Holiday, or just to
make a beer so obscure that not even a con-
noisseur will have heard of it, hlzad over on
Saturday (with a designated driver, of course)
to Heritage Farm and drink up,
