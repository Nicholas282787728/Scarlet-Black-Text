Wellness fair to promote healthy living

or MnNnO MONTAND

Despite February's gloomy atmosphere. students will have a
chance to liven up at the upcoming Wellness Fair on Tuesday in
various rooms throughout the JRC,

Wellness Coordinator Jen Jacobson '95 said she organized
the fair in order to promote healthier habits on campus and
define wellness beyond typical issues such as alcohol nnd sleep,
The on will include a variety orcxhibits. ringing from n discus
sion on the beneﬁts ordrinking tea to time for petting therapy
dogs.

“People have an initial reaction that wellness is exercising
and eating right, but really it’s much more holistic than that."
Jacobson said. “There's a whole orbunch of areas in your life
where you can address wellness."

According to Rebeccn Gernes '09, who will be leading a yoga
demonstration, awareness Ofwellncss at Grinnell has increased
since her ﬁrst year. “I was really surprised when I came here
three years ago and there wasn’r a yoga community," Gernes
said. “But now it’s been thriving, with people coming every
week and Iegulai attendance in the classes."

While wellness has slowly become a more visible part of
campus life, SGA Vice President for Student Affairs John Bur-

rows '10 said he believes the campus needs more wellness eduV
cation.“ortcn at times at crrnncll we get into contests of‘who
can sleep the least' or ‘wlio can drink the most on weekends',"
Burrows said. “There needs to be a cultural shift that places
more emphasis on wellness, which can decrease stress on cam
pust"
Even though alco-
lTol-relatcd hospital-
izations were high last
semester, Jacobsen said
the wellness fair was
not a direct response to
alcohol concerns. “The
wellness fair was already
in production before the
students came back in
August,” Jacobsen said.
“The students’ relationship wrth alcohol is onlyjust a tiny piece
Ofthe picture,"

Beyond the Wellness Fair, Jacobsen hopes to promote
healthy habits through new events such as spinning and yoga
classes, as well as a square dancing Harris party later in the
semester.

lliifi that places more emphaso

she was a good at for rhe College, “Her
nickname is Mn, and
she's very motherly,
and she’s a lOt ofﬁm,"
said Leah Krandcl
'09. “I think she's a really great ally, and
caries a lOt about students.”

While most were positive about the
choice Of Purdy to fill the newly open
slot, there is disappointment that an-
other change to RLCs is occurring mid-
year. “I'm really upset because 1 had been
talking to [Rachel] about the possibility
of staying next year, because she was a
really strong RLC, and with new RLC’s
leaving she'd help out with that mrnovcr,”said Kathleen Murr
phy-Geiss ’11, a Student Advisor in Gates.“[l3ut] as much as it

sucks for our start, it’s really good tor her, so I'm happy for her.’
Greene noted that RLCs leaving during the middle Of the
year poses a serious problem for student Afr
fairs. “I worry most about the Smouukcr staff.
They've gone through this twice now," Greene
said. “That’s unacceptable in my mind, It's an»
acceptable that people leave mid-semester, but I
understand the reality behind it, but that doesn’t
mean I like it."

Greene said that Strident Affairs may con-
sider implementing changes to next year's RLC
program to encourage start members to remain
for the full year. “I’m not opposed to looking at
ways for them to sign some agreement that says,
‘I pledge, Or indicate, that I’ll be here for the res
mainder of at least a year,” he said.
