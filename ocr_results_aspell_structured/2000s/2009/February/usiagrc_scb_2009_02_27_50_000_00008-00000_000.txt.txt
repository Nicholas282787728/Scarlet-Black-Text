Candidate forum

in! BRIAN SHERWIN

On Thursday afternoon, the SGA Elections Board
held an open forum for the candidates running for Vice
President of Academic Affairs (V'PAA), Vice Piesident
of Student Affairs (VPSA), and President of SGA
(PSGA). The candidates spoke about and answered
questions on issues vaiying from sclfrgovernance to
SGA tiansparency to goals for the future.

The forum largely centered on deﬁning selftgoverr
nancc in the context of strained relations between the
student body, SGA and the administration,

VPSA candidates all emphasized agreed on the imt
portancc ofcstablishing a conception ofselfrgowmcmce
before communicating with the administration.

But while many candidates, such as Mona Ghadiri
'11, called for a set deﬁnition ofself—govemanch'PSA
candidate Alex Peitz'lO voiced the necessity for a more
malleable deﬁnition. “To deﬁne self-governance [so
strictly] would [limit] the ﬁoubillty wirh working with
the administration," she said.

Beyond selfrgovetnance, the candidates were conr
cemed with the lack of student body participation in
SGA. Candidates for PSGA and VPAA stressed the
necessity ofﬁnding different approaches to motivating
the student body.

Fernando "Fonz”Jcnkins Y10, who is running for
SGA President, stressed his approachability ro vot»
crs. "You can pretty much talk to me about anything,"
jcnkins said.

V'PAA Candidate K’atcy Gagcr ’11 said that SGA
also has to reach out to imptove student body partici-
pation.

“I think approachability is important but I do think
that we need to go out and talk to people,” Gager said.

Overall, the candidates lamented the scant showing
at the open forum, which was poorly advertised. There
were approximately two dozen people at the forum and
those who attended were largely members of SGA.

“I feel like we shouldn't be begging people to come
to the open forum,"lcnkins said.

Alex White ’12, a student at the open forum, also
sharm‘l the sentiment of the candidates. “I wish there
were more people here,"Wlute said.“Unrorrunately, this
is an SGA heavy crowd."

 

 

C didates for PreSIdent

This scmesterJ’m starting
to undertake a large project
that helps resiruate sntdcnts
as key stakeholders within
rhe decision-making process,
speciﬁcally reaffirming our
ability to govern ourselves
because what we've seen has
been students’ voices and
opinions not really acknowh
edged by the administration
This semester, we have seen a

breakdown in community and a lot ofit’s because what
we need to do is completely revamp the ways in which
student opinion is solicited and advocated.

Time management. Last semester, the struggle was
balancing the daily committee work, in which I sat on
anywhere from eight to 12 committees at a time and
having to balance the day-to-day c-mailing and com-
mince assignmcnrs for all chose as well as working on
longrtctm projects.

I have learned to balance tackling rhe long-term
projects that will actually bring big meaningful change
while being able to delegate better and handle the daily
committee assignments on a regular basis

 

First on’I would really,
really like to provide this
missing link, this disconr
nect between the students
and the faculty and the
administration. And I want
to do that by reaﬂirming
or i‘eestablishing accovnre
, ability between students to
4,.- ,-‘ i » get more involved in SGA
Fernando leiikms ’10 because it seems likc,I use
this in my statement ofinr
rent, but you lead the horse to the water bur you can'r
make the horse drink.

Also, one thing rhar 1 was really looking to do
was we reassess whar we believe self-governance is
because we have like 1600 students here roughly and
you can say we have 1600 different interpretations of
self-governance. so we need to kind or brainstorm
and come up with one collective term ofwhat selfr
governance is and then we can move on from there.

I have been a senator in Joint Board for two 56*
mesters now. Also I feel like I embody the liberal arts
educational experience because I do a lot of things
inside and outside the classroom. I've been all own

 

 

 

The biggest thing 1 want
to tackle is, whether it's mic
or not, than: is apcrcc‘wcd gap
of trust between die circle of
the administration, student
government and students. Es-
pecially Student Affairs had a
great amount of stat? turnover,
and the students are mean,
\anccd that because of all the
newness of the stuff coming
in, they aren’t entirely Familiar

with what Grinucll is,whal we hold to be fundamentally

Grinnclllan.What I want to do is make sure that students

know SGA is on this better than us doing right now and

increase the communication and transparency between the
strident government and the students.

Well I spent a semester as lhe senator for CND and
two semesters as the senator for Smounker, so I do know
joint Board fairlywcll, how it does work and how it doesn't
work . . .On the Safetyand Security/\dvisory Committecl

with theirown autonomy and to decrease any kind offeel»
ing of hostility hctwccn security and studentsThe other

;

This past year, I have served as the VPSA fol SGA.
I have worked with nearly every administrator and have
dcvclopcd good rclationships with all ofthcchfarc that,
I served as a senator] served on many, many committees
that deal with many different aspects of the College.

We have the sclfrgovcrnancc handbooks that talk
about self-governance being raking accountability for
your actions and realizing that you ate part of a broader
community and that you need to be responsible for that
community. It also means taking care of yourself and
busing care of each other, I think we need to take it a
step further and really thoughtfully articulate how selfr
governance is played out throughout our daily life and
how we can educatceach other as to how selfrgovcrnance
should guide our actions. [We] also [need to] realize that
we are part ofa broader community in which we engage
and share governance. we govern ourselves but we do
have to negotiarewnh the power structures offaculty and
administration and through self-governance we need to
discover what our role is in those negotiations

I think the primary goal will be reorganizing the
Cabinet and committee structure of SGA. After being
one of die evccutives this past year,1 have learned which
committees are not as effective as they could be and which
Cabinet positions just don‘t make sense anymore.

ARI-I and Noyce. so,1’m an athlete as well.1'm a part
ofa lot ofstudent groups such as the Debate Union. I
run my own radio show. so, I’m a wellrrounded person,
and I do an array ofthings, so i feel like that’s what
an SGA President needs to identify,

I feel like my weakness is that I'm not an insider.
I'm an outsider. I will be the ﬁrst to admit that I
don't know everything that the SGA President does
or what entails in this position, but I feel like I'm a
quick learner,

What 1 intcrprer as self-governance is simply re-
sponsibility, taking responsibility, raking accountabil-
ity. It all boils down to that. Being productive members
orsociery, rhar's whar i feel self-govemance is.

I would deﬁnitely try to push nnd encourage
snidents to directly get involved with SGA no matr
tei what. For example,1 want to make Joint Board a
little more accessible. It is accesstblc to students right
now but one of my ideas was to actually have Joint
Board recorded and have audio recordings and have
that segmented and have that on Pioneechb and so
students can have access to that and it’ll be archived.
say they wanted to listen about the shoe policy in the
hallways, you don't have to listen to the whole Joint
Board proceeding bur you can go and click on that.

committee where we manage ST'IFund. . . . i have [done a

Deﬁnitely 1 think time management is the biggest
problem thiitl’ve had~especrallylearmngtoovcrcomc itin
academics, learning to balance my academics with student
govcmmcnt and SEC and student organization involve-
ment and student activism is time management.

Sclftgovcmance is, ifnot deﬁned by, anchored in trust.
Trust between students rhar notonlywill you not infringe
on somebody elsc's space, time or peace, but you will go
out of your way ro prevent yourself from Infringing on
someone clse‘s space, time or peace. Additionally; it is not
only students but between students, student government
and their administration.

Well, ﬁrstly 1 plan to be much more active in the
tians‘ition period to make sure that every single mcmbcr of
the cabinet that we eventually appoint will know exactly
what their job is on a day-today basis,so they can hit rhc
ground runiung.Thanvas a small problem that rhe previous
Cabinet encountered and we wont to save as lnuch time as
possible. Mote speciﬁcallyl want to work on Joint Board
