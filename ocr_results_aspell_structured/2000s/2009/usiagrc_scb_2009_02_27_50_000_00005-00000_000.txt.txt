Bad president, bad theatre...

W
(2008)

Bush biopic needs focus

Most of us already made up our minds
about George w. Bush (played here by Josh
Brolin) long before the ielcase of directoi
Oliver Stone‘s W Over the past few years,
we have been bombarded by news reports,
serious historical portraits and character
sketches, all ofwhich have combined to makc
Dubya a rather ignominious political ﬁgure
in the eyes of most Americans.

Rushed inro cinematic release in time for
the end of the Bush presidency, Stone's film
adds to the interpretation ofour now fmmer
president by focusmg on his dramatic chars
actor. Stone thinks ofhimselfas a dramatist,
and though we might prefer the omniscient
perspective of an objective documentary, his
film is more interested in perpetuating famil-
inr storylincs and anecdotes than providing
any kind offull-swecping analysis.

Many of these anecdotes occur outside
of the White House, resorting to the Bush
biography stereotypes that we know so well.
This means we get a whole lot ofBush the
drunk, Bush the hapless poli 'cian. and Bush
the lucky son ofa former president who rode
coattails to the top. This is all before he be-
comes president, where the real problems
(Iraq) ﬁnally happen.

The problem with Stone's version of a
Bush ﬁlm is he never chooses an overarching
angle or aspect ofBush to focus on.The lack
ofrransparency in the Administration causes
a certain amount of uncertainty, so we end
up getting dialogue that uses anecdotes and
onealiners that are already quite familiar to
the public (think “misunderestimareU. Sec—
ing this kind ofwriting on “sanirday Night
Live" usually brings laughs. Here, it feels out
of context, and in a ﬁlm where Stone does
not want to exaggerate any aspect of Bush,
context should matter.

Perhaps this occurs because the film div
vides itself rather arbitrarily between three
different stages of Bush’s life. There is the
fratsboy, beersguzzling Yale undergrad; the
married Bush still in the shadow of his fame
ily’s politics; and the unprepared commands
er-in-chiefheading into Iraq. stone presents
Bush as a simple-minded guy over the span
of three very different periods, which just
isn’t very interesting. Its subject matter is
controversial, but the execution is not.

individual performances improve the
film, but they only go so far. Brolin is so
convincing that it is hard to not feel bad for
Bush’s character at times. and it also remarks
able how he manages to pull off Bush in
three different parts of his life. The scenes
with George Sr. Games Cromwell) and Dick
Cheney (Richard Dreyfuss) have some good
dramatic presence, but they remain excep-
tions to the rule.

m is an interesting film simply because
of its scope. Unfortunately, it ignores key
storylines and passes up plenty of other op—
portunities to pursue more interesting angles.
(This is why movies are based on a true story

Hamlet 2
(2008)

Parody breaks golden rule of
comedies. It’s just not funny,

What a draining chore it was to suffer
through the unfunny, cliched and annoying
Hamlet 2. Th: title’s funny enough, as is the
premise ofthe story, but that’s hardly enough
to save this train wreck.

Steve Coogan stars as high school the-
atre teacher Dana Marschz (his last name is
“funny” and hard to pronounce, accounting
for what felt like ten minutts ofscreen time).
Dana couldn’t make it as a professional actor,
so instead he has turned to teaching. The
problem isiDana has no talent! And he’s
kind otelumsyl And he roller skates everys
wlierc—andﬁillr down 2 lat!!! thahnhahal!
Hilariousl

When budget cuts threaten the school's
drama department, it will take aLl of Dana’s
cunning and perseverance to pull off a ran-
tastic musical spectacle: “Hamlet 21” But can
Dana break through to the inﬂux of Latino
transfer students (who Dana initially calls
hardened “ganghangcrs"), bring them to
gether with his old white students, and pro
duce something wonderful? Don't hold your
breath.

Needless to say, the play that Dana and
his students are working on doesn’t really
make sense. it involves Jesus,a time machine,
the characters of Hamlet, and an immme
(translation; sleepvinducing) musical number
called “Rock Me Sexyjesus” which includes
frequent references to Jesus' “swimmer bod."
It sounds much funnier than it actually is. In

another attempt to add laughs, they have gay
guys singing in the background of the musis
cal. Gay guys in musicals are always good for
a laugh, right?

How an actor as fine as Catherine Keener
(40 Year Old Virgin, Capo/r) got roped into
this debacle is beyond me. She follows the
rest of the cast by stinking up the screen as
Dana’s long suffering wife. David Arquette
is also around, playing their roommate who
utters only 15 or 16 words throughout the
course of the movie (HAHAHArﬁMeir
roommate doesn't Ialk that much—(bat mm! b:
funny/1!). Maybe Keener and Arquette just
needed the money.

Thank God (or sexy Jesus) that Amy Poc—
hler shows up later in the film to inject some
much needed comedy into the flat proceed-
ings. Poehler plays ACLU lawyer cricket
Feldstein, and after seeing her brief scenes,
you wish the movie was all about her. Sadly,
she's only on screen for 10 or is minutes,
then it’s back to comedy hell.

I only wish I could use Jesus' time ma»
chine and get back the 94 minutes ot’my life
I Wasted on this film.
