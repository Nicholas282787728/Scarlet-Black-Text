H1N1 vaccine available on College campus

Student encouraged to get vaccine, ward off possible mutation of virus

BY PETER SULLIVAN

The H1N1 vaccine will be available to all students on cam-
pus in a clinic Nov. 24 inJRC 101 from 11:00 am. to 2:00 p.m.
A clinic last Tuesday made the vaccine available to students
who are in a high-risk, or chronic illness group. Director or the
Grinnell College Health center, Karen Cochran, encouraged
all students to get the vaccine at the upcoming clinic.The clinic
is free, but students must obtain a signed authorization form
from the Health Center beforehand. The authorization form
simply veriﬁes that a student is under 24 years of age and is a
resident ofPoweshiek county.

“I’m hoping to get a lot of students," Cochran said. “If
they’re worrying about side effects, they should know that I
got the vaccine about a month ago and had no side effects. It’s
made exactly the same way as the seasonal ﬂu vaccine,"

According to Cochran the turnout at the clinic for stur
dents with chronic illnesses who had the opportunity to receive
vaccines berore the general population lastTuesday was not as
strong as expected~60 to 80 students were vaccinated but ap-
proximately 300 were eligible due to chronic illnesses such as

diabetes and asthma.

Even lfall students were vaccinated at the upcoming clinic,
there’s no guarantee that the H1N1 virus will be completely
eliminated on campus. Cochran raised the concern that the ill-
ness could mutate, and is thus encouraging students who have
already contracted H1N1 to getvaccinated as well.

The virus is currently not as widespread on campus as it was
at its peak the week prior to Fall Break.There is aboutone new
case per week, and ill students continue to be quarantined in
their rooms until they go 24 hours without fever. No Grinnell
students have been admitted to the hospital due to H1N1 this
far, although a few students have developed pneumonia, as a
complication of the ﬂu, Cochran said.

Students appear not to be too concerned about getting the
illness."1’m not really worried. but l’d probably get [the vaccine]
as a precaution,"Savannah Duby'ls said.

Not all students indicated they would even get vaccinated.
“I’m not that worried about it,"William Jones ’13 said. “Plus if
everyone else gets [the vaccine] Iwon't get sick."
