Three years ago, four Grinncll students left a IVlnrdi Grns
celebration in st. Louis to drive through the night back to
Grinneu.iust outside oflovva City, the student driving the car
dozed off, and the car rolled into a ditch. sending two students,
Liza Colburn ‘09 and Yuki Goto (formerly '08), through the
car's back window.

Though the other students involved in the
accident recovered quickly and returned to
school, Goto sustained a traumatic brain ins
jury, was in a coma for two weeks, underwent
brain surgery, and after three years is still at
the Rusk Institute, an expensive staterof-the-
art rehab center in New York City

Goto will be beginning his last cycle of
rehab treatments this month. “At the end of
every cycle the doctors reevaluate him and
recommend if he should come back or not
and this should be the last one that he needs,"
said jelal Younes '08, a friend of Goto’s. "It's basically just se-
mesters like college semesters."

The rehab process has been long and draining not only
for Goto, who works constantly to regain physical, emotional
and mental capacity, but also for his family, who work with
Goto to fmd sources of funding for the extremely expensive

treatment.

In order to raise money for his rehabilitation program, in
November 2008 Goto decided to run the New York Marathon,
which he completed in a time offour hours and 43 minutes.

After the success of the New York Marathon, Goto has
entered into the Boston Marathon, to take place on April 20,
2009 to raise funding for the costs of his fir
nal semester. “Since the ZOrweek program of
the rehab costs and living expense sum up to
64,050 dollars it is very difficult for me and
family to afford for me to continue this train-
ing." Goto wrote in an email to his friends and
family

“[Goto’s] story shows both what an indie
vidual and community are capable of. Grinnell
supported Yuki when he needed us,” said close
friend Ben Schrager Y08. “Then Yuki drew on
the support of us, his family, and his own de-
termination to overcome his deficits He is still
a part ofGrinnell."

After his accident, a group of Grinnell‘ians came together
and created the Friends onuki group in order to spread aware-
ness about Corn and his situation.Thc Friends onuki group
and Grinnellians at large have greatly contributed to financ-
in_ Goto's rehabilitation to this noint. Efforts have included

“This' Is a poem I recently wrote. I m trying to
overcome the fear of my future that doesn‘ t have
the choice I hoped for."

~Yuki Goto

Slowly walking, head bent down
Doubting myself and denying the pain

Resisting the reality, mired in fear and hopelessness
Can't ﬁnd a place to go. wishing l could disappear

Standing back, looking at myself
I need to cross this street reach there,

Why are the lights not turning green!

It kindly spoke to me that I need to take a detour

In the throes of separation from who I was.
Nobody can change what happened to me
Part with my past

Prepare (or anything to happen

I haven’t reached my limit

I keep walking to look for who I am

Even if it's the fragile tiny star .
Finding a meaningiul life means creating a new me
It is not the end of the road

There will beganother way

The sun will be up after my lonely night
| see a glimmer of light
I keep walking to ﬁnd it

presenting an art show exhibiting some ofGoto’s photographs
and arranging a FogFast program. As Goto looks to begin his
ﬁnal semester at the Rusk Institute, funds arc now critical to
his completion and hopes for maximum recovery.

Goto‘s primary goal is to return to Grinnell to finish his
degree, and to get back to his old life. "This last semester is
crucial for him and would be the difference between coming
back to college or not," said Youncs. "[Tlie Rusk Institute] is
expensive, but it's really helping him get back to be in school.
And that's really where he needs to be.”

As his marathon and poetry (see sidebar) evidence, Yuki
has made significant progress in regaining personal skills and
self. “Every time I see him, it’s just leaps and bounds in his
progress,” said Younes. “And as far as his personality, it's all
back, so it's been great to see him because it’s been a slow
process."

All of these steps of recovery are helping to piece back
together the a person Schrager calls “selﬂess" and “amazingly
generous."

“I remember before the accident, Yuki told me his life goal
was to save one African orphan’s life,” Schrager recalled.
