TROPICAL SENSATION: What a beautiful Combina-
tion of words. it conjures up images of island vaca—
tions, marvelous weather and delicious rice dishes.

'PLEASURABLE SENSATION: This week is all about
but the inevitable over-
eating atThanksgiving will render us immobile and
unable to take advantage of all that we’ve learned.

BURNING SENSATION: Never a good feeling.

Response to a response to a re-
sponse to a pretty old rant

Dear Mason F.

So,..basically, what you're saying is that
“Self—Governance" oundoncs harmssrncnt?

Mmmm,fUST LIKE A GRINNELLIAN
to mention ”Self-Governance" at the drop of
a dime! I understand it's difﬁcult for you to
consider another possihllity as to why I chose
to rant in the ﬁrst place. Try taking a step back
outside yourselﬂ K, hun?

Love,
Michelle 0. ’11

November 17,1961

Ten cars of a Chicago and Northwest-
ern freight train were derailed early Sunday
morningjust east of Darby Gymnasium.

All the cars were damaged to some extent
and the wheels were ripped from several.
Seventy-eight feet of track was damaged,
and the railbed was gouged and furrowed

 

 

 

 

You got served! Be more polite.

Some of you are whiny jerks. We all need to
calm the hell down like whoa. Y‘all need to re-
member that the servers are not responsible for
the quantity of beer at Harris.When we say we’re
out, we actually are out. (That’s what the cups on
the taps mean) Also, we don't keep other kinds
of alcohol behind the counter, duh! Since when
did it become okay to expect beer at 12:45 at a
party as large as Fetish?

Please remember the sewers are giving up

their night to give you FREE alcohol! kthx

Hearts and kisses,

Why are there only two rants?

Doesn’t anyone want [0 write a rant? Aren’t
people angy about things? Don’t you have 142
words of complaining to get out? Aren’t there a
bunch of trivial things that get Grinnellians all
riled up? Don’t you want to excercise your ﬁrst
amendment rights?

Week after week the sen: has been supple
mentlng two voluntarily written rants with one
last minute, ﬁller rant. Is it too much to expect
that out of. like, 1400 people on campus, three
individuals will have a petty grievance to lodge?

Come on, Grlnnell. Get pissed off!

Angrily yours,
