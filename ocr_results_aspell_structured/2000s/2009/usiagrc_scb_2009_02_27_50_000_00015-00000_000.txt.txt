capture MWC championship

EV Martcus 7.1:th

Last season, the men's golf team fcll just short of an MWC champion
ship behind both Monmouth College and Knox College. This year, with a
bevy of returning players and a strong firstsyear recruiting class the team
looks to right the ship and capture this year's championship

According to Pete kieselbach '10, one oitlie leading scorers on the team,
irew talent promises to deepen the lineup this season. "We added three prerr
ty solid freshmen this year.".Kicselbach saidThc addition of Pete Mnrsho
’12, Eric Ragan ‘12, and SalilKalghatgi’12,mcdns there will be more strong
contenders for the top six who will play at conference.

Along with this inﬂux of new talent, the team only lost one senior, Joe
Fox Y08, so the core from last season remains intact "In previous years we
struggled to ﬁll out a roster ofsix guys who could break so," Kieselbaeh said.
“Now we have it."

The team, which is coached by Brian Jaworski, will be, for the first time,
able to send two teams of five each to various tournaments, a testament to
the team’s depth ofability.

Despite this deep well oftalent, the teairr may be limited by budget con
straints. Because of costs associated with golf tournament, the team cannot
enter all of their golfers into every tournament.

As they crossrtrain in preparation for the season, the team has been
meshing well. “The great thing about our team is that we all hinge on each
other," said Jeff Kljaich '11, a returning golfer, “Everyone shares responsibil—
try."

The onermontlr regular season leading up to the conference champion-
ship will provide ample opportunities for the team to feel out the competi-
tion and get mentally prepared. “It’s a good opportunity to measure how
we're doing," said Carlos Lu ’10, a member of the team since his first year.

Tire team will be traveling to Tucson, Arizona over spring break to com-
pet: in a tournament and will also travel to Monmouth for a tournament
before eompeting in the MWC championship. “A lot of pre-conterence is
getting mentally prepared to play conference.” l<ljaich said.

According to Lu, MWC competition will be weaker this year. Moir-
mouth und Knoxiboth ofwhom finished ahead of Grinnell last year—lost
top players, leaving room open for Grinnell to capture the title.

If Grinnell wins the Conference title, the team will have an automatic
bid for the NCAA national tournament in Florida.

“I am as exerted as I have ever been about the golf team, because not
only IS this a deep team that has a lot of talent, they’re an extremely enjoy-
able group of competitors to work with,” said coach Jaworski. “Everybody's

Men’s basketball looks to capture MWC
championship this weekend in Darby Gym

BYMARKJAPINGA

One month ago, the odds that the Grinnell men‘s basketball
team would host this weekend’s Midwest Conference Tourna—
ment seemed miniscule athest. The Pioneers had wonjust one
of {out January games against their toughest opponents, which
included a 49*point blowout loss to Carroll. The one victory,
against Lawrence, came via a David Arseneault ’09 free throw
with no time left on the clock,

“I came away from those games thinking the better team
won,"hcad coach David Arseneaiilt said.

But the pieces ﬁnally came together. Carroll and St. Nor-
bert collapsed, and the Pioneers made pets
sonnel changes that have since produced
an eight game winning streak and their
best basketball ofthe year, wrnning by air
average margin of 27 points. The trick.>
Play your best players. and play them ore

”Since we've played better teams,
wc'vc adjusted out substitutions," coach
Arsencault said. “More John [Grotberg
'09] Bobby [Long ‘09] and David [Arses
“could.“ We're sacriﬁcing the future for
the present."

Grorberg, Long and Arseiieauit pros
vidc most of the Pioriccrs'ofl'cn ’C attack, combining to score
64 percent or Griiinell's p irrs this season

But throughout their careers, tin, similar offensive skill
sets have meant that they hire otrcir led their own striiutls of
fivc,\vith no more than two oftlicrn on the (GUN at once Since
the Carroll loss on n 24, though, each mcmbc ofthc trio has
seen tlrertplayirig ime increase to around 22; minutes pc - orririe,
frequently putting all three orrheirr on the court rogeih

“We don't rie ly score more points, bur we're more cl:
ncient," Long said,“When it's just one or two nfus on the rloor,
[our opponents] can put their best defenders on us." with
all three of them out there, the Pioneers can almost guarantee
themselves one good onensire inarchup, opening up rlre floor
and usually guaranteeing a better shot

The move goes against 1/]: ryr/arn’s philosophy titriring oiit

smaller teams by continuously putting iresh players on the
ﬂoor, but it is the kind of tweak that might finally help the
Pioneers overcome their perennial struggle against quality op-
ponents. Griitnell has made the Midwest Conference Tourna-
meirt more times than any other team this decade, but has won
the tournament just once.

The team's wins this season, however, didn't come against
the conference elite.The Pioneers are 13-3 in conference play
this year, but 12 of those wins came against teams not in the
tournament in a year during which the MWC had just [our
teams with winning records.

The Pioneers must win more games
against the MWC's top four this weekend
than they have all year. Friday’s opponent,
Sr. Norbert, comes in having lost four of
their last six,birt the Green Knights should
still give Giiiiiiell significant tiuuble.

“They slow the ball down a little,
clog the middle of the lane, they know

week to piepaie,"Grotberg said.

St. Norheit’s personnel is particularly
suited to challenge Grinnell‘s game. The
Green Knights l’itdlng scorers, 6'4" for
waitl Brian Flei ilmilnn averaging iris
ppm, and 6'6" center Toirr Katzfey averaging 11.4 ppm. will
likely give the Pioneer doi‘einc problems and should riierk
havoc on the boards. "[St, Norbert] usually outieboumls us by
20 went tinie,"Grotb g said,

lfGrinncll sill‘v es St Norbert, they will |' o the \\’H\l1Cl'

digits with three of those coining rigrriirst iorrriirineiit oppir
nt-nts, Carroll returns rillrconi'crcncc guard \Vcs Ladiilig from

third seed

But, it's rvide open ioiirnrimcnt, iviih all four reri hold-
ing ﬁrst place at one point during the season. The Gi'otbct'g,
Long and Ai-seneaulr slroiv might be just the boost the Pioneers
need to send them ovei the top and into March Madness.
