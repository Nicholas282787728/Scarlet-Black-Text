The Women's Tennis Team is used to
certain precious metal around their neck
come post-season. However, in their last
two matches, the
Grinnell Women's
Tennis Team did not
strike it gold.

On Tuesday, their
previously perfect re-
cord fell after a 1-8
loss to Wartburg Col~
lege. Their only vic—
tory in the match came
from No. 3 doubles
partners Catherine
Fitch ’13 and Elizar
beth Montgomery ’11.
Last Saturday, they
were handed an even
greater defeat by Coe College, a Division
III nationally ranked team, by a score of
0-1

coach Andy Hamilton says there was
some struggle due to some shift in the

conﬁdent.”

”In order to get to the four team
[conference] tournament, we
need at least two wins this week-
end. Id be surprised if our players
weren’t going into this weekend

line-up.

“Constanza Alarcon ['13] was injured,”
Hamilton said, “Elizabeth Montgomery
stepped into double linerups and Catherine

Fitch moved in singles.
I'm pleased with their
resultsithe level of
play was very strong."

It was a nerverrack-
ing experience for the
first year, particularly
considering the tough
foesr

“My knees were
buckling and hands
shaking,” Fitch said.

But despite her ner-
vousness, Fitch won
five sets before los-
ing the match against
Coeinot bad for it first year that has only
competed in singles once. Hamilton was
pleased with her performance and saw her
grow just in the short time that she was

playing

“She has the tools to compete in singles
lineup," Hamilton said.

Fitch looks forward to building her
skills playing singles, especially against the
competition that the Pioneers face.

"It’s nice to be on a team that is used to
winning and are just competitive in a good
way," Fitch said

But the high level ofcompetition is just
all part ofthe plan, according to Hamilton.

“There is no clique or motto," Ham-
ilton said. “This team goes out and takes
care of business. My goal for the team and
the individual is to have fun and play at the
highest level they can play."

Despite the consecutive loses, Grinnell‘s
Women’s Tennis Team remains resilient
and conﬁdent.

“I am really proud for my team against
the strong competition," Senior Jill Akir
yama said. “The season is going pretty well,
they were two losses, but they were pretty
decent teams”.

Going into this weekend, the team is
now 772 overall, but 170 in the Midwest

Conference South division. This weekend
will be instrumental for the Pioneersithc
women take on Monmouth College today
at 4 pm. and Lake Forest and Illinois Col»
lege tomorrow at 9:30 am. and 3:30 pm.
respectively.These games will ﬁnish out di-
visional play.

Hamilton predicts success with Mon-
mouth and illinois College but Lake Forest
College might be more ot’a challenge.

“Comparing scores suggesrwe ate stron-
ger going into the match," Hamilton said.
“Our focus needs to be playing our game.
[Lake Forest] seems to me will be closely
contested, [they are] talented and deep, [Ila
linois college just] lacks depth to place."

With one win already under the belt
in conference play and some tough losses
behind, the Pioneers are looking for some
redemption this weekend

“In order (0 get (0 the four team [con-
ference] tournament. we need at least two
wins this weekend,” Hamilton said.“1'd be
surprised if our layers weren't going into
the weekend con ident."
