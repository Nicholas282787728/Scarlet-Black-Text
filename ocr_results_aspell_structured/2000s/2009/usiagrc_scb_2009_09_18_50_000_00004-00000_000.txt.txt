In the future, Student Affairs trusts and
hopes that students will ﬁnd alternatives
to keeping Cats in their dorms. To date, cat
owners have suggested alternatives that ins
elude having family or friends orrcampus,
including project houses such as Spanish
house, provide a new home for the cats. “A
vote is made in the project houses," Cons
oer said. “lrtlrcre is no dissenting opinion,
then the student will be allowed to have a
cat."

Some students still privately keep cats,
despite the crackdown “We love our cats,"
said a cat owner, who wishes to remain
anonymous, since RLCs have not found the
owner's cat. “As long as she doesn't bother
anyone, we will keep them here. It's nice,
during the winter, to come to your dorm
room and find someone waiting for you."

However, thcre was a scare th summer
when two students of a Methodisr Church
group from Cedar Rapids that had Smycd at
Grinncll contracted H1N1 just days after rev
turning home,

Since individuals are sometimes int'ec-

a warning e-mail was sent out to everyone at-

The College's Health Center is conﬁdent
that they will be able to handle H1N1 if it
were to reach the campus,judging from past
experience with rhe seasonal tin.

“Two years ago, about 80 students came
down with the scasorral ﬂu and we handled
