This semester, the Grinnell College
radio station KDIC 88.5 FM has a dy-
namic lineup ofradio shows satisfying just
about any music genre and taste.

First hitting the airwaves from Darby
Gym in 1968, KDIC has grown to well
over 40 radio shows—each one with its
own distinct and eclectic personality.

Students now have multiple listening
options from a variety or music shows to
special interest LGBT talk and on-air live
radio dramas.

KDIC has also seen a good increase in

LUCY SCHILLER

talk radio. “People have really been inter
ested in interviews,” KDIC Station Man-
ager Josh Tetcnbaum ’10 said.

This is Tetenbaum’s first year as the sta-
rion manager. As a first year, Terenbaum
began as a DJ and ascended the ladder to
become the KDIC station manager in his
fourrh year at Grinnell. one of his initias
tives with KDIC includes just getting the
word out,

“Most people don't know much about
it," Tetenbaum said, but he admits he is
sometimes surprised by who does listen.
This year is unlike others in that, due to

SPARC budget cuts, KDIC was forced to
reduce staff.

Still,Tetenbaum looks forward to what
this semester offers.

“Look out for KDIC T-shirts,”Tetent
bauru said."We [also] hope to get [KDIC]
broadcasted in public places like the Grill."

In addition to shirts and more public
airings, the station has scheduled a lot of
returning shows and some new ones.

“[ch will air] everything from psyr
chedelic music to indie and rap," Tetcns
baum said.The lineup will incoiporatc his
own show, “Listeanar.”

other shows include Alec Maliwanag
'13 and transfer Marcus Eagan’s ’12 “the
Straight Jacket," which airs on Thursdays
at 11 pm,

Eagen and Maliwanag describe their
show as, “TrendytlndietSmokiiitDankt
Dtinkin—Crowii and Purple Drank."

This eclectic show has gotten off to a
great start, with one of the first programs
featuring an on air interview with Canar
dian pop rock duo
Dave Thomson and
Paul Gigliorti of
Wawes, famous for
their hit radio single
“California.”

“Look for a lot
of big names to
come through [the
Straight Jacket] int
eluding Big Sean,"
Eagan said, referring
to a Detroit based hipthop artist signed to
Kanye West's G.0.0.D, l‘nuSlC label.

But if 90s boy bands, Britney Spears,
Michael Jackson and prergamlng (for
those of age) are more your taste, check
out “The Hoilr ofPower," hosted by Mclat

”We are good people who lite good
music and wanted to team up,.. i love
the me/iow nature ofradi'o here.”

Michelle Murphy ’12

nie Jucewica '12 and Matthew Rosenbaum
Y12.

With weekly themes, a two-hour playl-
ist ofonEsminure drift intervals that Hil-
ary Brown ’11 just describes as “drunk,"
you can expect to start your Friday nighrs
orfright.

Finally, “Chicken Noodle Soup" is ans
other one of many new shows starting up
this semester. Also known as “Gilly 8cMi—
chellc’s," this show combines Gillian Dry—
janski '12 and Gonzaga University trans-
fer, Michelle Murphy's '12 dual passions of
talk and music.

“We are good people who like good
music and wanted to team up," Murphy
said. She was excited bv the prospect of
having a radio show. “[ll love the mellow
nature of radio heie.”

Murphy's partner in talk-show crime
agrees,“1t's so chill," Dryjanski said, “and
we can do what we want."

Murphy and Dryjanski's “Chicken
Noodle Soup," which is summed up as

a “good time” and
“funky," is just one of
many programs that
really showcase the dis
verse taste of the stu-
dent body

Adventureland conquers Bromance

av COURTNEY SHEEHAN

Search for Adventureland on www.mzzrittmilamzt.tam and
you’ll find that the adjective most often used to describe it is
“charming." other popular descriptors are gentle, touching,
sensitive, sweersnarurcd. Perhaps not the words of choice you’d
expect to sum up a ﬁlm by the writer/director ot unabashed
penis sketclrfcst Superbad, Greg Mottola.

Adventureland also features a cast of regulars from the
super-producer of Knocked Up and Pineapple Express, Judd
Apatow. Although Apatow carp-reduced Adventureland with
superbad writer Ewan Goldberg and star Seth Rogen, the ﬁlm
marks a more mature and romantic turn in a long line of apat
rhetie dude comedies or “bromances.”

Set in the late 805 and scored by the indie band Yo La Tent
go, it’s a romtcom about a gory (Jesse Eisenberg) who gradu-
ates from Oberlin pumped to do the Eurotrip thing with his
yuppietintthetmaking friends, only to find out that thanks to
his family’s new money troubles he’ll have to ﬁnd his ﬁrst job
a little soonerﬂnd with a lot lower standardsirhan he origi-
nally thought.

Enter the titular amusement park, run by Apatow staples
Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, here playing a husband and wife
duo. Wiig ends up providing some ofthe funniest sneezesands
youtmisStit jokes, usually just by completing her husband’s
sentences in a mild-mannered tone reminiscent of TV show
Arrested Developmenrrsrylc delivery.

Kristen Stewart plays Em, a smart but troubled NYU stu-
dent also humming around back home for the summer. Her
lower hp oozes the power ofpout and her perpemally tousled

hair adds a sultry touch to both an intelligent rant against
apartheid and the wife bearers she wears under the obnoxious
Adventureland T»shirc Naturally, liberal arts graduate and virt
gin James (Eiscnbcrg) is instantly smitten"

To convey Adventureland’s successful execution of this
premise, perhaps it is best not to relay my own spectator experir
ence, but that ofmy viewing companion (to protect his identity,
I'll call him Bob). Bob was so viseerally engrossed by the pre-
eariously developing relationship between James and Em that
be literally dove head ﬁrst into the Younker lounge couch dur-
ing a scene where James makes out with the wrong girl after a
halftassed date.

Throughout the tormenting scene, Bob writhed in discomt
fort and covered his face behind interlocked arms, barricading
himselfagainsr this emotional onslaught.

Throughout the ﬁlm, Bob exclaimed things like, “you’re an
idiot!” and squealed in delight whenever (spoiler alerti) James
did kiss the right girl. So although the last act couldn’t be more
formulaic, this is a pretty good movie.

Adventureland finds itself not only in the Aparow arsenal
but also part ora rich slacker film lineage, dating back to Rich-
ard Linklatei"s early 905 comedies Slacker (1991) and Dazed
and Confused (1993) and Kevin Smith’s ultra low budget
16mm, hypcrrwitty indie Clerks (1994).

The concept of channeling existential angst through
ZOssometliing convenience store clerks and potheads has been
updated not only by Apntow's megahits, but also in the inbred
indie world ofmumblccore, where self-absorbed college grads
aimlessly chase relationships and temp jobs, such as Funny Ha

This year, Lynn Shelton’s hilarious Humpday broke out of
the pack by becoming a bona fide commercial and critical suc-
cess, Given its spin on sexuality (two straight pals decide to
make porn together) it's a crime that SGA isn't bringing it to
Grinnell, but hopefully you caught it at the Bijou in Iowa City
last week. '

Adventureland gracefully combines Clerks spirit ofbonet
head nihilism,Aparow’s buddy charm and mumblecore's reads
istically awkward dialogue as it addresses slacker dilemmas in
the form ofoue‘stions like: Do you keep eating a carnin com
dog even when it crunches like a snow Cone? Will you hang
out with that high school asshole who constantly kicks you in
the balls just so you can get a ride from him? Do you shun your
passion for Russian literature just so a dimrwitted Co—worker
will hook up with you? The smndard slacker answer; probably

but there's heart here, and a happy ending, making it a
good date movie. Especially if, like, you just don't feel like do
ing anything this weekend. Slack on.
