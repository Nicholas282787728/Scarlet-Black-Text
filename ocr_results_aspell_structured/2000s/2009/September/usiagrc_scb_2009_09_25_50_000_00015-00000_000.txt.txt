Volleyball bounces back with renewed sense of unity

BYDARWIN MANNING

The Grinnell Women's Volleyball team's
(o7) continued their season this past week
end with a 272 record at the lVIﬂCﬂlﬂsterTouF
nament in St. Paul.

“The success we had at Macalesler was
dilven by good serving and good serve res
cepuon,” Head Coach Jackie Hutchison said.
“When one looks at the score sheet they may
see we had a lot kills but none ofit would be
possible without the ﬁrst part."

The team has been improving in areas he
sides their serve reception and serving, include
ing their mental game said Erin Labasan ’11.

“We used to get down 0-2 in sets and be
dead," Labasan said. “But now we have cone
ﬁdcncc that we can come back and this past
weekend after falling behind two sets to Uni~
vcrsity of Dubuquc we made a comeback and
actually won."

They have shown the tenacity to not only
make comebacks but ro ultimately pnt plenty
ofwirls on the record, Last year, (ht: women
ﬁnished with ll overall record of 7-21 and 2-7
in conference.

“Our ultimate (cam goal is to play in
the conference tournament and only the top
{out teams do and we are on rarget for that,"
Hutchinson said. “My players are only limited
by the limitations they place on themselves."

Indeed the positive attimde of the ncw
head coach has been an excellent source of
inspiration and conﬁdence for the learn as a
whole. And as with any team. conﬁdence is
nsnally a recipe for success.

“When University of Dubuque got in a
difficult spot they fell apart and started snaps
ping at each other and getting down,” Muriel
Gallo-ChasanofT '10 said. “We on the other
hand said, Oh, we all have each other’s backs.
We are going to do this. and we are going to
do it together.’ and so we won."

The camaraderie extends of? the court as
well.

"We eat together, we hang out together
on the weekends, and the best part is that the
whole team has each other’s backs," Shelby
Carroll '13 said.

As one ofonly three first years, Carroll has
shown true ease at being a part of it all and
this became quite apparent in a match earlier
in the season as several players pointed out.

“Shelby and Michelle broke out into crazy
danceeoff tight in the middle of the Illinois
College tournament,"Labasan said.

The strong sense ofunity coupled with the
conﬁdence in their physical and mental abile
iry has done wonders in supporting the team

thus tar and should play a large part in helping
them continue these straight into Conference.

"Grinncll doesn't really have a winning
tradition as tar as volleyball goes and we're

looking to establish that this year and we can .

absolutely accomplish that," Labasan said,
The Women’s Volleyball Team hopes
to keep the trend of playing mentally and
physically sound as well as with conﬁdence
and unity as they go into their second home
