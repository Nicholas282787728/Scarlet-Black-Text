Grinnell has a new super alum, and he wears spandex.

Matthew Athetton ’95 won the Sci Fl Channel's summer real-
ity series, “Who Wants to be a Superhero?" which pitted ll aspire
rag dorgoodcrs against each other for the favor of Stan Lee, the
famed comic book artist and creator of SpiderrMan, the Hulk and
the XrMen.As his prlZC,Al’l1€{lonior more precisely, hrs alterrego
Feedbackiwill star in a comic book and an original Sci Fr Channel
movie. -

As part of the competition, Feedback and other heroes like
Monkey Woman, Fat Momma and Major Victory had ro complete
unorthodox tasks like changlilg.costuliics in public, fending orrar-
tack clogs and emotionally connecting with prison inmates. Feed—
back, who absorbs the powers from video games he plays and gener»
ates a 15-foot electric ﬁeld around him, convinced Lee that he best
embodied the superhero ideal.

For Atherton’s Gl'innell classmates, that is no surprise, In col-
lege, rather than warring tor a radioactive spider bite or reality TV
show, Arlietton made his own red and blue Spider'rMan costume.
Athcrton would run around campus throughout the year, showing

up at the dining hall and even his graduation in costume.

“It started off as a Halloween costume and nlrned out to be an
expression ofwho I was,"Atherton said

He also made costumes for supervanins and would recruit his
friends to stage battles around campus. His elaborately choreo-
graphed trghts entertained and impressed students. “He brightened
many a dark day when he ran through the dining hall wearing his
SpiderrMan costume," sard Damon Spayde ’95, Physics. "We ens
joyed watching him run around looking mildly rrdrculous,"

spider—Man soon became a regular sight and somethrng or a
legend on campus. So Atherton could eat without revealing his real
identity, Dining services made him an alternate meal card with the
name spider-Man and his pi- me in his Spldet—lVllln costume. “Ew
eryone on campus knew spider-Man, whether they knew Matt or
not," said Jacob Willig»0nwuachi '95, Physics.

Grinnell students at the time were also struck by how Athelton
did not lose his heroic qualities when he took offhls costume.“Matt
tried to emulate superhero qualities in daily life," said \Ni 'g-on-
\vuaclii, “He was like Peter Parker-Article, helpful and courteous."

Comparisons to peer institu-

tions have value and danger

av DAVID MONTGOMERY

iiell srndcnts ehptl'lenee a feeling or
dis vhcn they hc . the r n “peel institution."
Perhaps i s the unplc anr irnpli tron that Gririiiell
can be accurately comp cd to any other schoolﬂ
s antler on our uniqueness. Or perhaps it rs simply
that peer institutions has been so often raised to jus—
tify unpopular policies lrke turtion increases.

Behind the involuntary revulsion, there are several
important things to know about peer institution com-
parisons. First, in many areas, comparing Grinntll to
other schools is necessary and perfectly nor rnalwriere
schools are directly competing for students or faculty,
it would be fool-
ish for Grinnell
not to make com-
parisons—such as
solar} that others will make anyway.

For other decisions, the issue is murkien It seems
reasonable for the college to look at the experiences or
other, similar schools when considering doing some
thing new, but those comparisons should be taken
with a grain of salt, The administration and trustees
do seem to embrace this in theory, even ifsometimes
lessons from other schools are wrongly applied here.

Grinriell's selfrchosen peer institutions include
similar schools across the countryThere is also a core
group or Midwestern liberal arts colleges used for
comparisons where geography is a major factor.

President Russell K, Osgood said that the college
does not look at peers as much as many people think.
“The theory is that the college spends a lot of time
looking at our peers to ﬁgure out what we should do,"
Osgood said. ”That would be wrong ln fundamem
ral decisions, you don’t look at your peers very much."

Former President George Drake ’so said that even
in the late 19705 and early 19805, liberal arts colleges
compared constantly themselves to each other. He
said it was constantly a struggle to not go too far. “It
can be a little tyrannical to the institution to be too
tied to this peer group analysis,"Drake said.“Colleges
are different,"

For l‘lOl‘l’fulldﬂlnelital decisions, how for to go in
comparisons is less cls Students and administrators
considenng the poss ry ora campus pub have been
grearly helped by looking at Carleton College's came
pus pub, for eyanrple. But comparisons made when
studying Grab 8; Go missed the fact that many Slur
dents used the meal equivalency program not because
they did not have time to eat but because they wanted
to eat in their rooms or on the lawn.

Another issue is tuition, which the Strategic Plan
