—CAN’T GET OFF THIS [MAGIC "CAR-
PET'RJDE

Dear Can’t Get Off,

While we understand why you're worried,
masturbation is actually one or the healthi-
est things you can do. It builds women's re-
sistance to yeast infections, reduces cramping
during menstruation and relieves chronic
back painiit also improves men’s immune
systems and prevents them from'contracrc
ing prostate infections. Not to mention that,
for both sexes, masturbation serves as an im»
portant source of stress relief, a natural sleep
sedative and a mood booster (by releasing en-
dorphins into your body.)

To answer your question concisely, there’s

‘ really no such thing as masturbating too much

unless it starts to inhibit other parts of your
life. As long as it’s not interfering with your
daily activities (like eating, completing your
work and hanging out with friends), mastur-
bating, even multiple times a day, is perfectly
healthy and normal. So don’t feel pressure to
hop off that magic carpet just yetiy’ust sit
back and enjoy the ride.

Dear Boggled:
Choosing a method of contraception can

be diﬁicult indeed. You have so many options
from which to choose! As wise as I am, I can-
not make the choice for you. However, I can
give you some information to consider while
making your decision. One of the most com-
mon forms of contraception is the condom.
The male condom is placed over the penis and
Erotects against pregnancy, HIV, and other
TIs. Male condoms have a very high sues
cess rate (only 2-3% pregnancy rate when use
properly). Your good tricnd the SHIC carries
22 types of condoms, for just 25 cents per con-
dom. There is also an alternative, the female
condom.The female condom is worn by a (bio-
logical) woman during intercourse. It is a plaSs
tic pouch with rings at each end~one ring is
open, the other is closed. The closed end is has
serred vaginally, with a ring holding it in place.
After intercourse, you simply pinch the open
end and twist (to‘keep those spermies inside)

and remove. Discard in n trash can.The female
condom has the beneﬁt that it can be inserted
up to eight hours before intercourse. However,
it is easy to misuse the female condom, and
standard use pregnancy rates are nearly double
those of male condoms. However, when used
perfectly, the female condom has a pregnancy
rate of only

5 percent

over 12

months. If

you should

choose to

use either

kind of

condom, it

is impor

tant that you remember to use ONLY ONE
at a time. Using a male condom and a female
condom at the same time could result in {ear
ing or removal orthe condoms, rendering them
useless.

In addition to condoms, many young wom-
en also choose to go on birth control, so that
they have moreconstant protection. Birth eon~
trol can come in many forms, the most com
mon ofwhich are pills and vaginal rings. Birth
control pills are taken orally each day, and
provide the body with hormones to prevent
pregnancy There are several benefits to birth
control pills. When used properly, they are 95—
99 percent effective and they give women the
ability to control when they have their perk
ods. However, the young woman is' then given
the responsibility to remember to take her pill
each day. Also, the pill does not protect against
HIV or other STls.The vaginal ring is another
common form of birth control. The ring is
inserted vaginally and left in for three weeks.
Over the three weeks, it releases re ar doses
of hormones, thus providing the added benefit
of not having to remember to take a pill ch
ery day. Like the pill, the ring doesnot protect

against HIV or other STIs.

1 hope this helps make your choice about
contraception a little easier. Here are some
helpful tips to consider while making your
decision:

You should always discuss sexual histories
with a new sexual partner. It would also be

a good idea
to get tested
together. You
can make an
appointment

to get tested

Reasons for opposing student presence on CAS

In response to an article and letter in last week’s S (i3 con-
cerning a proposal to add students to the Committee on Aca~
dcmic standing, I would like to explain somewhat more fully
my reasons for opposing the proposal.

Academic standing is not a matter ofsclf-govcmancc, bee
cause students do not award their own degrees. If a diploma
from Grinnell College has any credibility with the outside
world, the reason is that the diploma' is backed by the faculty,
who set the requirements for the degree, determine the norms
for progress toward the degree, and recommend candidates for
the degree Analogies can be found in many simpler, everyday
examples of training toward certiﬁcation. If smdents were to
form their own college and award degrees to each other, they
would be entitled to rule on each othcr's academic standing, but

their diplomas would have a far different meaning.

It was proposed that students should hltve a voice when
academic requirements are being applied to students. From
this principle itwould follow that students should have avoicc
in determining other students‘ grade in a course, and that the
grade would not necessarily express the judgment of the in-
structor.

Confidentiality is a complicating factor. Details about poor
academic performance, and, particularly in appeals, about sins
dcnts' physical or emotional health or ﬁnancial circumstances,
are somerimcs prescnted by students rhcmsclvcs to CAS. It can
cven happen that an irate parent attempts to get involved. Stu-
dcnrs whose academic performance has been poor would rea-
sonably wonder why other students need to know about and to
deliberate about such personal and sensitive information.

I don't know in any detail about the operation of the Judi-
cial Council and the College Hearing Board, but I believe that
there is a stronger argument for participation by students in the

handling of cases oﬁstudent misconduct which is injurious to

other students, Similarly, the argument for students having aCs
cess to some types ofconfidential information would be stronr
ger in cases ofrhis type.

My opposition to the proposal was not based on any ins
formation about irresponsible behavior by any otrhe students
who had been attending meetings ofCAS. My'opposition was~
one of principle. This is not a matter of self-governance and
not a matter of trust, but a matter of where the responsibility
for the decisions rests,
