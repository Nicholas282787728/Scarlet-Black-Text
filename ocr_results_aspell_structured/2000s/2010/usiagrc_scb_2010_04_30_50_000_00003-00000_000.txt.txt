I‘m interested in the history behind your relations
ship with crinnell College. How did you get here?

Oh man, I joined like in the fall of1991, beeause my
husband and I were both selfaemployed. I had an aerobics
exercise business and he was a farmer. We had three kids
at the time and we really needed health insurance. And
theie was a part-time position that opened up that could
go along with our farming. It didn’t take too long for me
to get into a position that had health insurance benefits
for our family But it has been a really awesome experience
for me to be a part of this communitin love Grinnell
College.

Are you a native of Grinnell, 1owa.>

I grew up twelve miles from hele in Gilmin. My hus-
band is from Laurel, which is another eight miles away
from there. so. pretty much this area. And we have raised
our family on farms pretty much near the town ofGrinncll.

You said [you] love this community, and you said it's
awesome. What’s your favorite thing about Grinnell
College?

Over the years, 1 have really liked rhe speakersieverya
thing that is brought into this community. I think that has
been very fulfilling for my life. And I enjoy the personal
relationships with the students. They come and go every
four years and that's sad, but it's really great to work with
the students all through the years.

Who is your favorite speaker, or what is your favorite
event?

I would bet you during a period, not in the last three
years, but 10 years before that I probably attended more
Rosenﬁeld Symposiums than any member of the whole
community. I can’t absolutely say that one jumps out at
me.The commencement speakers have always been good.

They are all good?
Ijust took in a lot.I think [my favorite thing] is more

than just the speakers coming in, but I think it is just be
ing a part of this community.

of Sexually transmitted infections (STls).

 

So, we talked about the raetical reason for why you
initially came [and] what o you love about Grinnell
College. Why have you stayed at Grinnell for so long?
Is there some quality endemic to Griunell that has kept
you here?

It ‘ust so happened to have a artatime job with great
benefits, at this great college. The benefit package was
rent.

3 I hadn't even thought about working anywhere else.I
had my own business also, during the ﬁrst ears I was here.
I kind ofburned out with that business. My family] has
always been (arming, raising livestock, either chickens or
pigs. My children have gotten to take advantage of tuition
remission from here.

But, let’s go back to the benefit package. What it has
allowed me to do for the last eight years my peace work
has become very important. This has been a part-time job
that has allowed me to get a sound base in that. It’s just
in the last ear that I have claimed peace work as my life’s
work. So grinnell gave me the opportunities to have that

become my life’s work.

I read a ve short biogra hy of you on witnesstor
turcrorg. On e same page frezd a statement by you
that struck me as emblematic of Grinnell‘s effect on hu-
mans, and seems to characterize the peace work aspect
of your life, it read: “I demand that my government stop
the insanity of torture and illegal detention." Would you
like to talk about that statement and what it has meant
for your Life in recent years?

For exam le, the last few years, during our nice long
Winter Brea in January, I've been able to travel to Wash-
ington, D.C.And I’m sorry I've had ro keep going back all
four years, but that group you just mentioned7Witness
Against Torture—has hosted nonviolent efforts at calling
attention to the insanity of torture as a policy of our gov
ernment. January 11 is the anniversary ofwhen we 0 ened
up the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and this partieu ar is-
sue has takeniit's just one of those issues that I cannot
accept my government's stance on. It has reached the
point where it has said that it’s okay to torture peo le. So

have been trying to find way to put my body on t e line
to tesist.This pastJanuary Witness Against Torture orga
nized a 12-day fast from the January 11 to the 22,whieh
was when President Obama said Guantanamo Bay would
be closed. But it didn't happen. This was a particularly
intense time for the activists present. In addition to my
workwirh the Wirness AgainsrTorrure group], the Peacea
able Assembly Campaign that I am intensely arricipdta
ing in at this very moment also kicked off in .C. I was
able to s end my Winter Break in D.C., or almost three
weeks ot that time participating in two cam aigns whose
issues are so near and dear to my hem‘tiﬁn ing war, end»
ing torture and closing the prison at Guantanamo.

Your relentless activism has inspired Iowans of all
ages. My favorite example is that of Frankie. Frankie
Hughes is only 12 years old! Could you tell me a little
about Frankie and your relationship with her?

Well, I have known Frankie's mom Renee for the last
four or five years. For the ast two and a halfyears they
have lived at the Catholic orker, a place in Des Moines
rhnr otters hospitality for homeless people. There are a
number orpeople who live and work there and make of—
fering hospitality to the homeless theirlife’s work. So any
time in the last 10 years when 1 have looked for places to
do activism and direct actions, that group has taken me in
and let me work with them.

I think it was ‘ust last July I vot involved with one
or the eampaigns t at Frankie and’ her mom were both
involved with. It was [an] effort to call attention to the
need for singleapayet health care. so we organized a direct
action where we went to Blue Cross and Blue Shield. I
