After a three-month process, three candidates have been
selected to fill the Resident Life Coordinator (RLC) positions
left vacant in CLanGRala (Clark, Langan, Gates and Rawson),
CaNaDa (Cowles, Norris and Dibble) and JaMaLand (James,
Main and Cleveland). Arrron Dennis, Becca Don and Darren
Gallant were selected based upon personal merits and experrs
enees that faculty, staff and students believed would best com—
pliment Grinneil.

“All otour candidates are really smart, really cngagcd, really
want to bc a part ofthe Gr'innell campus communrty and total
ly believe in selfrgovernance," said Assistant Dean of Students
and Director of Residence Life &OIlEnta[lon Andrea Conner,

Conner had the final say as to who was hired, along with
Vice President for Student Affarrs Houston Doughar v and

masters studies working for a suburban adrliatc of the Chicago
Sun-Times, another experience Don can bring to rlre campus,

The third RLC, Gallant, diversifies the grorrp even further,
as his educational background stems from Brandeis University
and New York University.

“He has a lot of orientatron experience with the LGBT
population, [and has] done a lot with genderrneutral housrng,"
Green said.

current RLC Rachel Wike explains that for Gallant and
Others to already be experienced with genderrncutral housing,
self-governance and social justice can only aid m transrtroning
into their new position.

“There is going to be even more diversity among us, no
matter what your deﬁnition of diversity is, so I think that's

cases have been reported in Sioux County, and are warning

average of five cases were reported annually in the entire state

state in a 3-month period. Mumps were the reason the fre-

In protest of Arrzona's controversial new immigration

too drastic. Sandoval points out that US. Cellular Field (the

“I really felt like they could commit to the
sclfegovcrning community and understand
how their role rs different here at Grinnell
as opposed to other entry level residence life
positions at other schools with more struc—
tured positions,"Conner said. ,

A number of other factors also deter-
mined who best filled the job, including the
applicants academic backgrounds and how
their personal experiences would contribute
to the Grinnell campus. All three candidates

each incoming RLC personally “I'm rc»
ally excited to see how they're all going to
come together, because each of them has
experience in areas that are really impor-
tant to Grinnell whether it's social justice,
social responsibility or any other mission
that we like to stand for."

sport notable educations that reflect their interest in education
and social justice.

“[Dennis] comes from the College of William and Mary,
and even though it's a public institution, it feels, looks and is
selective like a private residential campus," Green said. “She is
an African—American woman who brings a lot of experience
with orientation, admissions work and multicultural work.”

Like Dennis, Don's education signifies her compatibility
with Grinnell's values and rdeals. As an undergraduate from
Kenyon College with a master's degree from the University of
Iowa, Dennis has experience with health and wellness, a subject
frequently discussed on Grinnell's campus.

“She has done a lot ofwork with harm reduction and health
and wellness so I think that when the campus continues the
conversation of how to help snrdents learn to have fun and
party safely as opposed to intensely and hard she might have
some expertise that might be helpﬁll," Green said, “She's also
a free spirit who by her own admission has a qurtky sense of

lectual as well as a social level."

highlighting responsibilities as RLCs. Kristen Armbrustcr
'12, wl_ro talked personally with Dennis and Gallant, was imr
pressed by the new hires.

“Arrion was actually my favorite of all the candidates,"
Armbruster said. “She was extremely happy about the posi-
tion, she was easy to talk to I think she'll fit well in our
environment."

Although all three RLCs, regardless of their past experie
ences and history, will have to adjust to Grinnell's campus,
Green believes all three candidates will bring their various
experiences in order to beneﬁt the continuation of a socially
just Campus.

“None of them have had traditional resident life cxperienCr
es but all of them have had socialjustice history and experience
and so that‘s what attracted them to Grinnell," Green said.
“When I think of all of their individual and collective experir
enees with working towards making society better, and serving
the common good,I think all of them will translate nicely, and
balance what [returning RLCs] Rachel [Wikc],Dan [Hirsch],
and Michael [Hunt] will already bring to the table."

International:

Demonstrators rioted in Athens, Greece this week to
protest lawmakers’ approval of an unpopular budgetrculting
package. The package, which will cut public-sector salaries,
raise the retirement age for women in the public sector and
impose new taxes, is the Grecian government’s response to
a European Union bailout. The bailout is worth 110 billion
Euro, or $140 billion, and is dependent upon Greece meet-
ing conditions set by the European Union and international
Monetary Fund. In response to the Grecian government’s
capitulation to these conditions, 18,000 people took to the
streets of Athens. Protesters broke shop windows, over»
turned garbage bins and set fire to vehicles and buildings.
on Wednesday, a frrebomb thrown into the Marﬁn Egnatia
Bank killed three workers—a man and two women, one of
whom was pregnant.
