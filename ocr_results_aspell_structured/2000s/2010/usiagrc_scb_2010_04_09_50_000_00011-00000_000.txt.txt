Softball loses doubleheader, prepares for weekend

BY CASEY STRICKLER

The Grinnell softball team lost a double
header against Buena Vista university last
night at home The Pioneers lost the first gone
5 0 but kept' it closer in the second to lose 3 Z.

The games went well, even though we
obviously would have preferred to win," said
Catcher Julia Reese '10, “The Iowa conference
is notorious for being more competitive than
the Midwest conference, so the fact that we can
compete with teams like Buena Vista and give
them a run for their money means that we are
playing pretty well. We had solid pitching, a re
spectablc defense and we were hitting the ball
hard."

These games were the first two of seven in
next four days for the team. They will travel to-
night to Janesville,Wisc, to face their first Mid-
west Conference (MWC) games of the season.

In Janesvllle, the Pioneers, who play in the
South Division,will face all of the Northern Dir
vision teams in the conference.This is the only
time that Grinnell will play their north div' ‘on
opponents in the regular season. Every team in
the south Division plays the North Division
teams once and each other twice. Winning a
game against the opposite division is wordi one
point and games within division are worth two
points. The two teams from each division who
have the most points at the end of the regular
season go on to the MWC Tournament. Last
year the Pioneers were only four points shy of
making the tournament. This year, the team
plans to start conference play with a bang.

"[This weekend] Id like to get better than
half the wins,"sald Interim Head Coach Craig
Arendt

The Pioneers are hopeful because the con-
ference competition, particularly the pitching,
that the Pioneers will face will not be at the
level of many of the terms they saw on their
spring Break trip to Clermont Fla.

"These are much more winnable games,
Strolnqiiist said. Ifwe hit well this weekend we
will win [most of these] games.

This was the case when die team traveled
to Florida. Despitc'winning their first game
against Carleton 10-2, the offense struggled
throughout the week. The Pioneers returned
from Spring Break wrth a 1,7 record to start the
season. The team is now 2-14 with the games
they played this week

“The trip to Florida was pretty good," said
second baseman Brianna Gallo '11. “Our record
wasn't exactly what we’d hoped."

“It was a learning cxperience,”Arendt said.
“We learned a lot of what we need to work on
nnd it’s all going to help in the long run.”

Two records that did fall Gallo’s way were
the program's stolen base records for a career
and game. Gallo stole five bases in the Pioneers’
5-4 loss to Washington and Jefferson College
and now has it career total on9 stolen bases as a
junior. Gallo did not realize she had broken the
career record until it was announced at a game
later in the week.

“It feels good—after I found out I broke the
single game record 1 was like, ‘I guess I should
look at the career record maybe I should shoot
for that,’ but then I found out that I already
broke it," Gallo said.

Gallo's speed and finesse around the bases
were important assets to the team especially in
light of injuries that took two key Pioneer hit-
ters out of the lineupThe team struggled with
injuries as both Stromqulst and Hannah Ney
’li missed playing time. Hopefully however,
both players will be back to ﬁill strength by sat-
urday.

“The biggest thing we've been focusing on
is getting healthy,” Arendt said,

With only it players to field nine positions
there is little cushion for losing players to in-
jury. The lack of numbers also means everyone

can compete with anybody in our conference."

McNabb trade symptom of Redskins’ ‘Maddenitis’

Most football fans will tell you how dear-
ly they miss the game during the spring and
the summer and how they can’t wait for the
start ofthe upcoming NFL season. However,
I am not one ofthosc football fans, mute the
contrary, actually, as a dieahatd Washing
ton Redskins fan, I love the offseason.

You know that old saying about
March weathel, “In like a lion,
out like a 1ainl)?"\’VelI, the Red-
skins approach the offseason
in the cxact opposite fashion
They come into the offsea-
son timid and dcmoralizcd Rf:
ter their poor showing on the
field that year, then they offer
a few ridiculously fat contracts
to a few aging superstars, and
by the end of the offseason the
Redskins look like supei Bowl
contendcrs. if they gave
out smallcr, plastic replic
cns ofthe Vince Lombardi
trophy for “winning" the
offscuson, the Redskins
would actually have a need
for a tiophy case Okay, I’m
exoggcrntiiigithe Red-
skins havc won five leltguc
championships (three of
which were Super Bowls) five conference
championships ind l3 division champion-
ships since their inception in ‘1932. Do you
know when the most recent oftliese champi—
onships was won, though.> Eleven years ago,
when the Redskins took advantage ofa weak
NFC East to capture their first division title
in cight years. Some quick math will verify
what you already know: the Redskins haven't
done squat in nearly two decades. In other
words, the Redskins haven’t done squat in
my lifetime, which is funny. Not that l'in
bitter or anything.

to call Maddenltis. It’s ill the

important, ovcrall team depth wins chain—
pionships, not singular superstars.There are

22 positions on a football team—therefore,
most teams are likely to have multiple areas
ofneed when heading into an offseasoii, By
signing one big-name player atone position,
a team limits the amount ofmoney available
to sign players at other positions of need.
The 2009 Redskins are a perfect exillnpleﬁ
coming into the offseason the team's areas
of need included offensive line and defenc
sive line. The Redskins made a splash when
they signed ailcpro defensive tackle Albert
I’Iaynesworth to it $100 million contract.
The Redskins then used their first round
draft pick to select standout defensive end

because we couldn't score any points because
our quarterback had the living crap kicked
out ofhiin on a weekly busis because we had
no offensive line to speak of. l'in not hitter

You would think that Dan Snyder would
have lciirned his lesson by now. We even
brought in a new GM and a multiple supei

from going illtcr yet another aging superstar
that could set the team back mot \Cr 5-10
you-s Yet,1found rrwselfunsulpiised when
I read that the Skins had traded with the
Pliilidclphia Eagles to obtain quarterback
Donovan McNabb. I've watched McNabb.
33, play since he was drafted out of Syrac
cuse in 1999 (not coincidentally, the last
time the Redskins won the NFC East). I've
seen him rip out the hearts of Redskins fans
titne-and-tirne again, and I ilm ecstatic that
a proven quarterback will suit up in the burr

gundy and gold in 2010.1 did not like the

trade, though. I like the part that means that
we don’t have to face McNabb twice a year.
Howevei,1 think this move reeks ofSnyder's
Maddenitis flaring up again,

Sure, quaiterback was definitely an area
of concern for the Redskins entering the
offserison. However, offensive line is an
even bigger area of concern, and that has
not been addressed. Even if the Redskins
draft Russell Okung or Treat Williams,
the top two offensive line prospects in the
draft, with their first round pick, that's still
only addressing one of five positions on the
line, Unfortunately, this is a wc'ak year for
offensive linemen m the free agent market.
However, it is an unusually strong year for
offensive linemen in the NFL Draft. The
McNabb trade sent our second—round pick
in this year’s draft and a conditional third or
fourth-round pick in next year’s draft to the
Eagles. And in case you're not up on current
trends in the NFL Draft, itjust so happens
that the second, third and fourth rounds are
when the best offensive linemen ntc ‘iICUP
ally drafted. I don't care how good Donovan
McNabb isino quarterback is leading the
Redskins to the playoffs ifhe is laying on his
back the whole game,

I said earlier that depth is the key to wine
ning a championship in the NFL, Depth is
achieved thiough spending money wisely
and correctly evaluating the risks and po»
tcntial rewards of every transaction—it is
achieved through finding solid players in the
later rounds of the draft that will help the
team foryenrs to coinc,it is achieved through
patience. When it comes to the Washington
Redskins. inv thoughts and feelings can be
summarized in one phraseil um impatient
for patience.
