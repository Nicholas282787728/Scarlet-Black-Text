Bv MATTBncllTbLL

This weekend's Drag show won't be the
only event shining a light on gentler issues
This week the College celebrates 20 years of
Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies as an
interdisciplinary concentration and, as of last
year, a major. The program is hosting a sympo-
sium in honor of the date, showcasing student
work in the field and inviting alums for whom
the concentration was inﬂuential to piesent
and discuss the history of the concentration at
Grinnoll

“[GWSS has] been one ofthe most popur
lar concentrations at the College in terms of
numbers of students doing it, and then in the
last few years we’ve had a number ofnew hires
and a real intense interest by students to make
it a major,"said Associate Professor ofGender
and Women's Studies Astrid Henry, referring
to the 29 declared GWSS majors and concenc
trators.

In the fall ofzooo, the GWS program was
on unstable footingithc number of students
in the concentration, as well as the number of
students taking intro courses, was in decline,
according to Associate Dean of Students,
Kathleen Skerrett. To strengthen the program,

was added to the core program, and the new
GWSS was offered as a major, two changes for
which students had been petitioning for many
years.

"I’m really excited, because, say, four years
ago we were talking about, ‘Oh, the 20th an-
niversary is coming up, and that’s a really big
deal.’ But at the time we only had somebody
who was so percent, who was in GWSS, and
now we have two faculty who are 100 percent
in GWSS. So that’s a huge improvement, that
we have a much stronger, deeper program,"
said Karla Erickson, Sociology, who teaches
Human Sexuality as part owass.

The 20th anniversary symposium begins
Friday at 4:15 in the Forum South Lounge
with a keynote address by Gayle Salamon ’94.
an assistant professor of Gender and Women's
Studies at Princeton and author of“Assuining
a Body: Transgender and Rhetorics of Male-
riality."

On Saturday, also in the Forum South
Lounge, the GWSS program will host four
panels on issues related to gender, women's and
sexuality studies, beginning at 9:30 am. with
Film and Media Studies, moderated by Lake-7

Fulbright and Watson fellowsh'p scholars announced

For many ofthis year's graduates, the next
year will prove to be as educational as a year
at Grinnell, as they leave the bubble and en-
ter the outside world as post-graduates. For a
select few, they have the opportunity to go to
grad school, or travel the world for free. This
will certainly be true for this year’s winners
of the Fulbright Scholarship and the Watson
Fellowship.

Both scholarships are run through the Ofr
(ice of Social Commitment, though they pro-
vide very different experiences.

“The Fulbright offers one year ofintema-
tional education experience... they offer essen-
tially two types of grants for undergraduates,”
said Director of Social Commitment Doug
Curchins, "one is an English teaching assisr
tanish' . the other type of Fulbright grant
is one in which you apply to go to a university
for one year to study a question or topic which
is of particular interest to you." The Watson
on the other hand pays for students to spend a
year traveling the world to interact with other
cultures,

“The Watson is also one year, post gradir
ation and international but is a quite different
opportunity," cutchins said. “\Nith the Watt
son you propose to do something experiential
in nature and you can go to many different
countries."

While the Watson Fellowship is limited to
{our nominations, when it comes to the Ful’
bright Fellowship, the College does not limit
the number of nominees. Despite this, both
scholarships are incredible opportunities for
students who want to engage in an educational
experience abroad, According to the Office of

According to Rassenfoss, Cutehins was
highly active in the application process.

“This year he got a bunch of people from
the writing lab together and we had a ‘FiiI-
brightnpalooza,‘ or something, and we sat in
the computer lab in Noyce and worked on our
statements together," Ritssenfoss said.

and interests. _

“Whether an applicant gets the position
or not, they come out of the process learnt
ing more about themselves," Cutehins said.
“[With regards to] the Watson, in a good
year, one wins, in a great year two win," said
Cutchins.

Last year, none of Grinnell's nominees
were awarded on: of the 50 scholarships,

though this year, Filippos
Rodger Tsakiris ’10 received
3 Watson to research sus-
tainable energy and its im-
plementation in his island
community in Greece.

Tsakitis’ Watson idea
came from his time studying
abroad in Denmark and a
visit to the island of Samso,
which operates entirely on
renewable energy

“I had a bitterness tovmrds how my island
community was developing,"Tsakiris said. “It
has become a tourist place for rich Greek peer
pie who bring their own attitude and a culture
they like.l wanted something better and look
ing at a place where they have done what I
wish to do, I knew that was possible."

In an effort to develop a sustainable model
for his own commiinity,Tsakiris’ trip will take
him, as of now, to Iceland to study geothermal
energy. Sweden to research successful got/c
erninental support systems, Sardinia to study
its similar geography and weather and New
zcaland to study fishing techniques and youth
activism, But the Watson itselfis only the be-
ginning ofTsakiris'project. “I’m going to train
