Oztan sees opportuni-
ty in Grinnell’s limits

In his four yams at Grinnell,Tolga Oztan has
had hair to his shoulders, shaved his head, had a
full half-year's growth of heard, walked around
bareeﬁccd, and has ﬁnally cultivated a really
aftellent mustache.

“My ﬁrst year I didn’t
shave for six mondis and I
had almost a Shirk beard,
which was awesome,” said
Oztan, “bur then—you
knowJoeing Muslim and
going through the security at
Customs, that beard wasnta good idea. Now every
two or three months I have a new face,burl don't
change much inside and ISlill leave the mustache
every now rind then. Initially the mustache was
3 additional Turkish thing for an 150 Cultural
event, but I’vejust kept it.”

Whether or not we can grow facial hair. a
lot of us have or will experience culture shock
studying or traveling abroad, Oztanwho
cans to Gnnnell from Turkeyﬂntperienced it
somewhat in reverse. “So
’m from IstanbulY there’s
like 16 million people
living there, it's a huge city,"
Oztan said, "and there’s
alvnys something going on:
concerts, festivals, whatever
you want to do, And then 1
come here, there is absolutely norhing going on,
there is nothing to do. It was interesting, you see
people who don’t even know how tojaywalleThat
was my big Culture clashipoople don't know
how to jaywalk."

recounted the story of his Gnnnell arrest, during
his lirst year. “I was walking from swimmer
House to Hams and I had this Budweiser and
this eop ear came out of nowhere. They took me
to the smtlonifor a stupid, crappy Budweiser!
That was the best part of 10/10, you could just
dnnk openly and nobody cared,"

Despite the 1.1x opcnrconminer laws one/10,
Oztan's favorite allrcainpas party, by tar, has been
Titul‘tlr Head, “1 made a movie iny lirst year
with the Gcrlniui assistantjohan .. it didn’t win
anything. But what I like abour Titulilr Head
is that s bonding through mass hysterlni
people feel free to really eapiess themselves but
in a cortnnnnal way. And i like to see people
get dressed, you know, you don’t see people get
dressed tery otten here."

Despite Lht: fact that Coming to Grinnell was
in and of itselta kind oistndy abroad openence.
Oztan also spent a semester in Budapest studying
math, “I loved Budapest," Ozmn slid. “I think it
was a good break from Grinnell, to be back in a
big city again. Cheap wine, public drinking was
O.K, again—that vlms a thumbs up for Budapest,
you could drink ouside by the Danube. That's
also when I realized about the jaywulldngl went
there with a couple Grinnellians and students
from other small towns and colleges and they had
some IIouble VVlLl‘i rhe imEC."

Even dioiigh he came with trdﬁic navigation
skills, Oztan learned a lot from his time in
budapest, most especially about what kind of
math he wants to do. “I liked theory up until 1
went to Budapest and did Lhe progntm them
People talked .nath all the nine—during lunch,
during dinner and I realized this is just not nae.
After Budapest I decided I had to combine math
and social sciences."

Taking his side-along interest in anthropology
into account, Oztan will be attending a PhD
program at UC-Irvine nen year. which makcs
pragmatic use of complex math in the studv or
behavior “its gonna be a good change, especially
in terms ofwcfirher—back to the Mediterranean
climate. And my adviser there is studying
some nomadic Turkish tribes. He's collating
anthropological data and crying to model rl'ic
behavior of these people, so it's a combination of
timhio rind math."

In addition to preparing him for his graduate
studies in temperate California, Gnnnell has
shaped Oztan in a ntunber of ways. “My adviser,
David Romano, ms one of my best friends at
Grinnelmeissosupponive,outside ofacademics
aswell. He is that kind ofperson who really really
cares about his advisees. That's the thing abour
Grinnell, there are many people like that, but for
me it was David."

In the end, it was actually Grinnell’s smallness
that Oztan felt shaped him most profoundly.
“I’ve learned tolerance from Grinndl," Ozmn
said.“l mean no one thinks they're intolerant, you
always think you're tolerant, But then you come
to Grinnell and you meet so many people Erom so
nanny diﬁaent backgrounds and you are in such
a small place that you have to interact with diern.
After a time you learn to interact with people
from did’erent backgrounds and 1 think it's a very
good thing. It btulds character, that's what it does.
Becoming tolerant’isn't die right way to say it
You just not new people:
