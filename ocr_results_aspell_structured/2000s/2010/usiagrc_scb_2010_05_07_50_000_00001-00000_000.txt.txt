Remnants of on-campus party lead to administrative action

Bias-Motivated lncident Protocol initiated soon after evidence found, students rallies around issue, judicial action to be taken

BYJAI GARC AND SOLOMON MILLER

According to various sources, bowls used
for a party in Clark Lounge on Saturday, May
1 were found to contain derogatory language,
including misogynistic, racist, ablcist and pe-
dophilic terms, individually directed at over
50 female members of the Grinnell College
community.

An ofﬁcial complaint was ﬁled with the
college on Tuesday, May 4, About 75 of the
estimated 150 bowls present at the party
were recovered, according to Vice President
of Diversity and Achievement Elena Bernal
’94. Bernal declared this a biassmotivated ins
cident, in accordance with the Hate Crime/
BlaSTMOKianed Incident Response Protocol.

The College Hearing Board was also con
vened to review a potential breach of the stir
dent conduct policy. No official information
has been released regarding the organizers of
the party.

Various ofﬁcial and unofficial responses
are taking place, following rumors circulat-
ing on the cyher forum GrinnellPlans. SGA
senators were ofﬁcially notiﬁed that the Pmr
race] was activated at their weekly meeting
by SGA Administrative Coordinator Ethan
Struby‘ 10 An all campus e mailwas sent out
by Bernal and President of the College Rus—
sell l<. osgood at approximately 9 a m this
morning.

The bowls contained leler, according
to an anonymous source who saw themr The
party was called “Cunnilingus," presumably
comparing the act of drinking JelleO from
a bowl labeled with a fcmale’s name to the

 

sexual act.

“The contents of the party and the cvie
dence that was found pointed to a hiasernoe
tivated incident because it was an identity
based target group," Bernal said. ““In that
instance everyone on a bowl was a woman,
And then there were additional comments
[discovered] that were racist and ableist."

The writing took the form of first name,
derogatory nickname, last name, according
to Bernal and several of those named. As the
Protocol mandates, the Ofﬁces of Diversity
and Achievement and Student Affairs no-
tiﬁed all of those conﬁrmed to have been
named before the all-campus e-mail was sent,

"No one received a cold esmail every
one received personal contact," Bernal said.

Juli Garcia-Vicente ’10 received a phone
call Thursday from Student Affairs notifying
her that she was named on two bowls.

“The one that was truly insulting was a
racial slur," Garcia-Vicente said. “It’s hard
knowing that it comes from some people that
you have considered yourself very close with,
and have had classes with these people, and
hung out in social situations with some of
these people,"

Those named were given the option to
know what was written about them, accord
ing to GarciaeVicente.

““There were multiple family members or
both faculty and staff who were targeted7
along with students, staff and faculty mem
bers," said Vice President of Student Affairs
Houston Dougharty. Bernal confirmed this
and added that athletic coaches'rclatives were

among those named.

cunnilingus was founded by students in
1997 as a counterpart to the already existent
“Blow Job Party” The original Cunnilingus
featured bowls of beer with the names of ce—
lebrltiesinot Grinnellians—at the bottom,
according to an alumnus who attended the
original party, who asked to remain anonye
mous.

No ofﬁcial complaints were ﬁled about
the party until this year.

“These [nicknames] are overtly sexist,
racist, ablelst, and all kinds of misms, and
that's not what Grinnell
is about," said Aimee Ta-
brizi ’10, who was named
on a bowl,

As more information
became known, various
members of the Gtinnell
College community bee
gain to respond publicly.

Evan Hunsley ’11 and
Lexy Leuszler '12 led a
posterernaking session on Thursday after-
noon to put welcoming messages up across
campus. The idea came out of a regularly
scheduled Feminist Action Coalition (FAC)
meeting on Wednesday, which was attended
by many non-FAC members, including stu
dents with ties to people who attended the
party, according to Hunsley.

“We’re not trying to point any ﬁngers or
cast blame or do anything other than show
support for people who may have been made
to feel unsafe,” Hunsley said.

Director of Athletics Greg Wallace is
working to prevent a similar event from oce
curring in the future.

“Educations is the key—there’s no doubt
about it,”Wallace said.

Wallace plans to take steps to acclimate
new student athletes to Grinnell. Interim
Head Football and Women's Track Coach
and Fitness center Director leffPedcrsen’OZ
conﬁrmed that male athletes were involved.

Bernal and Osgood further conﬁrmed in
their all-campus e-mail that the “invitation
only’ party was coordinated and attended by
select male athletes.

“[RLC] Dan Hirsch,
from Real Men [and I
have] been working to—
gether to talk about de»
veloplng a program that
we can be able to address
with all the student ath-
letes, and in particular the
male athletes during their
early time when they’re
here on campus next fall,” Wallace said.

Students have also taken initiative to one
courage discussions about these issues.

After commenting on the incident on
GrinncllPlans, Gretel Carlson ’10 and El-
eanor Russell '10 were approached by ﬁve
students with ties to the party. They are tens
couraged by the success of the resulting con-
versation, and hope to provide a similar op-
portunity for more members of the College
community
