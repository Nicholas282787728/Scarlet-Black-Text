Looking to rebuild after dropping seven
straight games in the weeks before Winter
Break, the Grinnell Men’s Basketball team
broke even with a record of3v3 since coming
back to campus on Dec, 29rThe team lost its
most recent game 8280 against Monmouth
College on Wednesday in Monmouth.
The Pioneers are now 376 in con~
ference play and 4-11 overall with
eight games left this season,

Coach Arsenault admits that
he knew this would be a tough
season for the Pioneers.

“The best teams we have had
through the years would have
struggled amy from home with
this year's teams from William
Penn,'Buena Vista, Wheaton,
UW Whitewater,” wrote
Head Coach David Arser
nault in an e—mail.

But since the be-
ginning of Midwest
Conference play, the
Pioneers were immedi—
ately competitive and after
break, they have gone 3-3 in
conference.

“As a team, we were strug-
gling at that point to get wins,
so they [practices] were kind
of tough but at the same time,
they were very good for us.
We had a couple of rough
weekends , but this past
weekend, we started to tur
things around." ,

And with conﬁdence building, the season
is surely salvageable in their eyes.

“We have a decent shot at conference
with a lot of winnable [future] games," said

Men’s Basketball brings the
heat after Winter Break

Matt Chalupa ‘12. The Pioneers will make
the Midwest Conference Tournament if their
conference record is in the top four. Current-
ly, Grinnell is in seventh place and but only
two games back.

Coach Arsenault is conﬁdent about the
advantages of the System at this point in
the season. As other teams become
fatigued earlier in the game as the
season stretches on, the Pio—
neers will have “fresher legs
by comparison" due to their
multiple substitutions, Arse-

nault said.

“I thought our energy
level was fantastic this past
weekend and it helped that
we didn’t need to lean on
any one player for excessive

minutes," Coach Arson
nault wrote.

Although the
team received a lift
from these recent
wins, Arsenault is
still searching for

“vocal presence in
practice" and there have
been questions about
which player will emerge
as a main scoring threat
in games as well.
“Last year we had

main scorers who did

most of the scoring the

last three years," Kaitz

said. “This year's ques-

tion was who was going to do alot of

the scoring. Matt Skelly has really stepped up

and Grifﬁn, although he’s hurt now, was do-
ing some good scoring."

However, the lack of a real designated

shooter has given the Pioneers‘a little more
ﬂexibility in the way they approach games,
one major change in the team's game rhis
year is an increase in spreading the scoring
oppormnities.

“I think we just kind of let the offense
start ﬂowing rather than to trying to dictate
what and happened when," Chalupa said.
“We just started playing basketball,”

Coach Aresenault would prefer to depend
on just a few "statistically signiﬁcant and the
remainder of the roster occupies needed play
ing roles," but due to youth and injury getting
the chemistry built for that kind of system
just wasn’t developing. Kaitz, co-captain and
point guard, was out with an injury for tive
weeks and after his return Grifﬁn Lentsch
'12, ﬁrst year who leads the team in average
points per game,

“We have been hurt by the injury bug,”
Coach Arsenault wrote. “So, creating some
sort ofsynergy has been difﬁcult, Rather than
focus on goals we have been more or less of
the mindset to try to get better every day7
which we have been doing.”

Chalupa said that although the Pioneers
are currently winless on the road, the team is
still young and does not have the same Con~
fidence and energy exerted from the support
at home games.

“We're a young team and being in some-
body else's gym you lack the support from the
crowds, which for us gives us theconfidence
and swagger we need to do What we do. Irwe
can on the road, stay as one unit and just be
super supportive, we will deﬁnitely be able to
pull something off,” Chalupa said.

The Pioneers will continue their Confer
ence tournament push against Lake Forest
College (54 in MWC, 7—9 overall) on Satur-
day in Chicago and then return home to {ace
Fontbonne University on Sunday:

 

 

As a consumer of sports media, I have been rather apalled at
how the media is treating certain actions taken by some very high
profile sports individuals.

I am not talking about Gilbert Arenas, Tiger Woods or Mark
McGwire, each of whom doomed their public lives with their ex-
cess of arrogance and have recieved treatment ﬁtting their delu-
sions, I am instead attacking two individuals who appear to be just
as deluded, but no one seems to have noticed Where is the media
condemnation of these two who have broken the cardinal rule in
athletics—team above all else?

I refer to Chiarterbacks Colt McCoy and Brett Favre, two ins
dividuals who led their teams to amazing seasons that would have
been impossible without their contributions. McCoy led the Texas
Longhorns to the Bowl Champion Series National Title game,
while Favre led his Vikings to the NFC Championship game.
Both ofrhem lost these games and they lost on this stage for the
etacr same reason in my mind: cowardice.

Both of these guys were not fully committed to their team.
With Fawe, its apparent in his arguments with Coach Brad Chile
dress and mental errors that caused his interceptions that would
ultimately doom his bid to return to the Superbowl. I disagree
with the assertion that bccuase Favre knows more than Childress,
he should be allowed to impugn Childress bccuase by deﬁnition,
a quarterback is a player and thus should always at least respect
the Coach, no matter the facts of right and wrong. Without that
respect there is no team, no synergy that allows the whole to be
greater than the part.

And how can we forget the whole Green Bay Packer debacle?
Ever since he left Green Bay, 1 have regarded Favrc with grow—
ing disrespect. His weenicewhiny, flippy-iloppy decisions about
whether to come back are embarassingly childish._You'd think a
40-year-old would have a little more diginity, but he doesn't even
think he's done anything wrong because he’s so arrogant.

McCoy is, I believe, a much more concerning matter Iwiil ho

the ﬁrst to admit that I don’t know the facts of his medical case
entirely, but I do know what I saw, and what I saw was someone
more concerned with his own future than that of the Glory of the
team. I remember distinctly the announcers of the game saying,
“He'll make the decision that is best for Colt McCoy,"and I could
not believe my ears.

Sure, McCoy wants to make sure that his NFL stock doesn’t
decrease with an injury, bur ifyou wont play in the Nacional Cham-
pionship Game, then what game will you pinyin? In addition, Mc-
Coy was not the only player on this ream,his value ms not so great
that he got the Longhorns to the Championship alone. And when

teammates that he turned atwy £rom them: “Your goals are not as
important as mine." Sure other ‘hotns will follow McCoy into the
draft and end up making a ton of money just like McCoy, but that
doesn’t mean that all of them will, or that all of them don’t care
about winning a National Championship. And that means that
when McCoy left the game, he abandoned his duty to these players
who had sacriﬁced for four years and worked their asses off to get
into the championship game.

Above all though, and I know it's cheesy, but when Colt Mc—
Coy left the game to ensure his millions, he left millions offans out
in the cold. Personnle I’m a Mizzou Tigers fan,which is in the Big
12 Conference, the same conference as Texas. And dammit,l want
to see the big 12 break the SEC’s dynasty on College Football.
This might not have been our year anyway, but Mccoy dropping
out made that dream impossible. And I’m not even a Texas fan.

Allin all, there is no “I” in team and even though its boring
and old, teams that actually commit to each other and winning are
the teams that will have advantage. The most telling statistic that
these two Premadonnas have in common is that they’re both losers
now. Sure they won a lot in their career, and I won't knock Favre
for what he did in Green Bay, but they cannot, should not and
hopefully will not ever win the big one.

 

 

 

Basketball
Women try
to rebuild

BYMARCUS EAGAN

Despite a recent scn'ng oflosses, the Grinncll
Women‘s Basketball team is hoping to return
to their pre-break form. After starting 3-4, the
women dropped eight out of nine during Winter
Break Coach Gluckman and her team are con—
ﬁdent that this recent skid does not reﬂect this
team’s ability,

"outside of the program one could look and
saywe lost alot ofgames,” Coach Gluckman said.
“But the challenges, growth and team-bonding
[um die team experienced during break] were
what we needed."

Coach Gluckman and Jessica Shorts ’10, the
team’s only senior, said the break allows players to
build a basketball team community and literally
nothing else because there are so few distractions
on campus during break

“We did have two weeks at home, which was
really nice to get otircampus," Shorts said. “For
the break, being here for three and a half weeks
was kind oflong, but we got a lot of basketball
in. Itwas nice because we got to focus on baskets
ball, we didn’t have to worry about homework,
people’s minds were clear."

But after the women began playing in Janu-
ary, they had lost some ﬁre,With a record of1—8
in the New Year, the Pioneers were left to won-
der: "Why?"

“The year started oﬂ'ptetty strong and with a
lot of momentum,” Eliaabeth Burnett '12, Cen-
ter/Forvmrd, said. “Most ofoux losses are a result
of an eight minute breakwe seem to take in every
game...usuaily right after halftime. By halftime
it's a really dose me, bur then we come out of
[halftime] and [the opponents] go on a run."

Burnett, who scored 12 points and shot
slot for nine in the PioneersY 6075 loss against
Monmouth Wednesday, is right. The team was
actually ahead 29-25 at the end of the ﬁrst half,
before things started to unravel, yet again, for the
Pioneers.

"We can play one really good half ofbasket-
ball," Gluckman said.

Gluckrnan cited “composure” as a potential
reason for drop—off in the second half, but for
whatever reasons, the ream thinks they have
the components needed to overcome this men
tal block For the relatively young team, which
is assembled ofjust three juniors and the aforer
mentioned lone senior, every game is a chance to
improve team chemistry improves and the play-
ers’ comfort level.

"I think we have a lot ofpotentialdwe have
a lot ofdepth,"Bumett said.“As opposed to years
before, we have post players and we have solid
guards. Not just rhe starters but the people on the
bench.. .can carry the team."

The Pioneers play Lake Forest College at
1:00 pm. tomorrow, in Lake Foresr, Ill
