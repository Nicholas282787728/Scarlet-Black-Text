Smoking increases patrols

BY BAsstLAmHuKi-l

Persistent smoking in Cleveland Hall
has led Campus security to enforce new
measures in hope that students in South
Campus dormitories will abide by the Iowa
SmokeeFree Air Act of 2008, which bans
smoking at workplaces in Iowa.

The bill speciﬁcally disallows smoking
on «school grounds; including parking lots.
athletic fields, playgrounds, tennis courts
and any other outdoor area
under control of a public or

' private educational facility.» ”/ peuonally have nalseen
As a private' educational any (ﬂanges, nor fps/I any—i smoke-free

facility, Grinnell College is h' ,,
supposed to be 100 percent l mg
smokrfree.

Last Thursday, Assistant
Dean of Students and
director of Residence Life
and Orientation Andrea Conner and
Director of campus Security Stephen
Briscoe issued a statement that was sent
out to all residents of Cleveland, informing
the students that campus security
representatives will he patrolling to see
that no one is smoking within the campus
dorm. ' ' .

"The increased patrols are an unfortu-
nare realiryiwe did not wanr it to get to
this, but‘thcrc are too many repeat-offend-
ers," Conner said.

Throughout the night, Campus
Security dispatches officers to patrol the
South Campus loggia. With the new
pittrolling' in Cleveland. ofﬁcers will be
walking throughout the building to make
sure no one is smoking.

While the Campus Security may not

fine the smokers with monetary penalties,
smokers will be asked to smoke in the des—
ignated smoking areasiin other words,
public sidewalks. In addition, those caught
smoking will also be reported to rhe Jun
dicial Council (Judco) for a “follow up,"
according to the e-mail by Conner and
Briscoe.

The Iowa Smoke—Free Air Act is not
the sole incentive the college has in mak—
ing sure the campus is
smoke—free. Many workers’
contracts entitle them to a
environment,
Without the smoke-free
environment, workers can
potentially file complaints
and grievances.

Furthermore, many stu*
dents and start in Jamalnnd
have ﬁled complaints regarding the smok»
ing issues through out the semester, ac»
cording to Resident Life Coordinator Eric
Vos. '

While Conner and Briscoe appear con-
fident that the added security will work,
they hope that the Campus Security will

. not need to go into stricter enforcement.

Such enforcement includes refering the

_ sruderrr (O Judco..but not fees, according

to Conner.

“We don’t wanr to [ﬁne smokers] ifwe
can avoid it," Conner said."..Some can afv
ford them, some can not.”

Meanwhile. students in Clevelind do
not feel cherc is a difference. in patroling,
according to CleVelond SA Winnie Mu-
lumba '12. “I personally have not seenrnny
changes, nor felt anything,” she said.
