After stormy night, Track ready to get on The Dick

BY MAX CALENBERG

After spending spring Break in South Carolina and compel»
ing in two meets, the Grinnell Tracchain is ready to display dieir
work for the home crowd this weekend when the Dick Young
Classic kicks offat 8 am. Saturday, April 17 at the Les Duchrack,

“There are two meets that matter to us, really three, U16 “1’
door conference meet, our home meet and the outdoor confer-
encc meet." said Head Coach Will Freeman. “It gives us a chance
to pnform at home and it looks like we are going to have great
weather and good competition, so to me that means were going
to have good marks. Right now thats what we are trying to do, get
fast marks for qualifying for conference."

The squad is coming off ofa training trip to south Carolina
where in addition to some team bonding and beach time, the ath-
letes had multiple practices per day and focused on reﬁning the
technique of their events

“lrwent great, the weather was great and the work ethic was
great, Freeman said. Those trips are big for technical events like
throws, yumps and hurdles. These kinds of things really beneﬁt
from rhc one on one time and we had multiple sessions. We were
working out three or four times a day. .with different groups and
you can't do mat here,"

Following their return to Iowa. the group traveled to Cornell
College in Mount Vernon, LA, where they competed in the Hill-

top open with some impressive rcsnirs. Erik Jarvis ’12 won the
zoo merers with a time otziozza while Mikc Tylinski '11 was
sccond with a nine of2:07.69. Additionally, Joey Synder'lZ won
the Javelin with a throw of175’4".

on the women's sidc, Isabelle Miller'll placed second in the
400 meter hurdles wirh a rirnc ofosJa seconds, Sachi Grabei ’12
took second in the pole vault with a vault ofs feet and Jacqui Vair
tin '13 ran to third with a time of20:07.14 in the 5000 meters

“1! was a good first meetiits still really early in die scason—
not everyone was able to compete but we did well," Gtabet said.

one key change this scason is the absence ofWomen’s Head
Coach Evelyn Freeman, who is on sabbatical for the semester. In~
terim Coach JeffPedersori has stcppcd in arid rlic athletes seem
glad to have him.

“[Pederson] is doing a great job,” Giaber said. "A couple ofus
were a little concerned at the beginning of the season because we
are used to working with [Evelyn Freeman] so muchﬁhe’s our
cross country coach too so we work with her every season of the
yearibut he has been doing a really good job filling in for her and
making sure everything is going really smoothly.”

coaches can set up a smooth system but some factors are
just out oftheir connol, like on April o,when a violent hail storm
moved in, making an otherwise beautiful day dangerous. Although
most ofthe team had ﬁnished pmctice before the storm hit, several

distance runners were caught out on their runs with nothing but a
ditch in which to take cover,

“I think it was a shock to dieir system. That‘s pretty serious
stuff~you wonder how they’re going hike it," Freeman said “i
worry about the shock ofsomething like that, you feel helpless,
you're out there and there is nowhere to get out of it. But they're
pretty strong folks, they're back ro doing normal tnining...and
they all got through itjust ﬁne. "

Teammates have noticed dieir teammates resilience as
well “They had a fantastic workout today, they took a couple days
off, took a couple days to heal," Gtahet said. Obviously its been
tough for them, they're battered and bruised, but we got away
without too many injuries.

Regardless of how the Dick unfolds, Coach Freeman knows
rhere is always one meet that means more than all the others coni-
birird. The Midwest Conference Championship, where the men
took third last year and the women ﬁfth, falls on the weekend of
May 14 this year.

“I’m just really encouraged w'iLh the way everyone is training,"
Freeman said, “They are working hard training hard, I just feel
really good,I think we are going to be where we need to be come
May and it's all about May, that Conference Meet is in our sights
from day one."
