Support for Student
Staff opening dialogs

This week, Joint Board unanimously resolved to support dis-
cussions about oppression and campus climate at Grinnell (see

article page 2). This resolution supports training Student Staff

to create an open environment for incoming first years during
New Student Orientation Also, SAs will be encouraged to hold
discussions on race, class, and gender during snrdy breaks We
hope that this will help new students understand how to talk
about these issues without reoortrng to hate speech.

We echo SGA’s (all ﬂ>r faculty and stat? members to work
more explicitly to promorc diversity They are an invaluable putt
ofGrrnnells identity and their involvement rs needed to change
Grinnell \Ve look forward to seeing hou SGA and Residence
Life enact this resolution

Tit (Head) for Tat: former
Editors-in-Chief J.

Francis Buse and Chloe
Moryl and final opinions

Johnny:

Like the majority ofcampns and a hefty portion of alums, we
love Tit Head. For some, it’s a beautiful excuse to expose them-
sclvss and their less appropriate ideas. For others, it's an invigo—
rating excuse to sit/stand, slightly intoxicated, and cheer andjeer
their peers movies. And for cvcryonc, it's an excuse ro rill Harris
auditorium and enjoy a film festival that comes only once a year
to one place.

The mainstay ofTit Head is, obviously, thc firms. But along»
side the ﬁlms are several important factors, such as the host, the
offbeat awards ceremony and audience participation. A balance
between these areas is all needed to keep Tit Head an event, and
not just a rushed screening of ﬁlms. This year was an event, but
the amount ofﬁlms shown—32 total—many of which exceeded
rhc already lengthy ﬁve-minute limit, makes the future ofTit

Head seem destined for unwelcome change.

Because digital cameras and editing are the unanimous
choice for students now, larger chunks of ﬁlm can be edited
in shorter amounts of time, by relative novices. While this
development is good, as the more movies submitted in the
vein ofTit Head, the better, it also could lead to an over-
crowding otthc ﬁlm rcsrival if new rules aren’t adapted to
measure the cernentiition of’l‘ir Head’s atmosphere.

If the organizers stuck fast to the five-
ininute time limit, minutes could be
shaved off of movies that everyone al~
ready thinks are roo long. EVCYl better, a
4*rninute time limit could be adopted.

The best films of Tit Head (and the
“best" terrible films), usually full well
under this mark, already, It is in the
drrink and tweaked interest ufTit Head
to be short and sweet, not long and opining,

Furthermore, if or anizers held and stuck to a deadline,
there would not be a resulting shorra of ﬁlms Instead,
people who truly felt strongly about Tit Hcid would know
to ﬁnish their movie on time. And, the resulting pool would
be lower, giving time for the host to perform their job and
keeping the nudicncc interested long enough to stick around
{or arguably the best part of thc nightithe awards, both
traditional and quirky. This year, vcry rcw audience members
were left at 11:30. Next year, if there were nvc to tcn more
minutes of ﬁlms, and the one-intermissioned, no-bathrooni-
break, norbeerrallowed event went until after midnight, how
many people would stick around for the whole event?

It is actually sort of, in the end, about the night, not the
films. Do the right thing.

Chloe:

After this year's Titular Head, the masses cried out “that
sucked” and “that was awesome" and “man, that was just
weird" like they do every year. What's strange about this year
is that for one reason or another, students think there is a
way in which we can "fix”Tit Head.

Fix? Fix Tit Head? Fix what about Tit Head? Okay,
granrcd the show ran a bit long, security not allowing people
to leave Harris was wack and the fact that they weren’t glw

Apr 3 2010

ing out soda was unfortunate. Personally, I think the fact that
Harris vnrs packcd on beyond capacity, despite the draconian
norpeeing rules, and the nearly three-hour run time. makes it
the most successfulTit Head in a long, long timc.

If anything needs to be changed, 'it‘s not really in a rule-
book. We can't say, “Oh man, whoever is running Tit Head
CANT lct pcoplc turn their movies in late." Why not? It’s
their prerogative. Having movies turned in late doesn’t necesr

sltrily have any effect on the quality of
thc film, it just has in clrecr on
thc amount orslccp Mark Sirl-
llvdn gets. The idea that a ﬁlm
can't be submitted late is similar
to the idezt ofa paper being subs
inirtcd latekcxcept I don't think
prorcssors got drunk ind rowdy
in order to judge papers (but you

never know).

Well, we could cut the amount of movies shown. How?
The chairpcrson arhitmrily decides which ho/shc doesn't think
should go in? Half the point ofT'rt Head ‘is to make TERr
RIBLE films. The other half is to make awesomc films. But
the rcrl poinr is that anybody can submit anything and then
EVERYBODY gets to boo it.

Let’s just address the length ofTit Head for a second. So
many films were submitted that' it ran for three hours. Some
students may not know this, butTit Head used to have a lot of
talking' in between ﬁlms, a lot of banter with the audience But
so many people were so excited about submitting ﬁlms that
we harcly got to enjoy the comedic genius of Margie Scribner.

Well, the movies could be shorter. Oh wait, there’s already
a ﬁve-minute time limit Just because you think your ﬁlm can
capture the hearts and souls and attention of a crowd of 500
drunk people doesn’t mean that it actually can Nobody’ s can.
Five minutes ‘is an extraordinary amount of time for anybody
ro pay attention to. So I guess the answer is really self-gov that
shit and when it says ﬁvetminule time limit, stick to it.

Mostly, we just can’t pretend thatTit Head is a serious en—
doavorThcrc may be a sprcc at Grinnell for a real ﬁlm contest
that doesn't involve gold spray-painted items from Goodwill
as its prizes, but that space is not Tit Head, so we should stop
pretending it is.
