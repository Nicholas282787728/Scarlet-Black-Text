160 plays home to Soviet Children

va LAWRENCE SUMULONG

Although not typically regarded as a gallery spacc, last
Wednesday the John Crystal Center( (JCC) )unveiled a col-
leCtion or 15 lithographs produced by various members of
the Soviet Artists Union during the early and mid 19705
Located in the lower level oftlie ICC. the colorful Bxhlbl’
tion entitled, "Young Pioneers: Lithographs from the John~
sonrHorrigan Collection," presents vivid, utopian vignettes
ofSoviet youth culture during the 1970s. specifically, these
starersanctioned pieces focus on and idealize the daily lives
ofchildren as a part ofthe Young Pioneer organization or
the Soviet Union.

“Young Pioneers"currently showcases not only the work
of Individual artists, but the curatorlal vision of Fanltoncr
Gallery Intent, Caitlin Deutsch ‘12. Dcutsth presented a
short and concise opening statement on Wednesday that
:titiciiliitetl her initial interest in the subject matter.

“I really wanted to \Vrlrc a paper that to setl [not] on
artistic intentions, but on art's role within a historical nnrs
rarive,"Dcutsch said.

Whilc Wednesday’s opening marked the culmination of
Deutsch’s research, she was ﬁrst acquainted with the litho-
giaphs through an Ait History seminar and her work at the
Print 8; Drawing Study Room and later chose to closely
study them through her Faulconer Gallery internship

Before being housed and hung for the ﬁrst time In the
Jccs art gallery, the 16 lithographs underwent a journey
of sorts. According to Dcutsch, the pieces originally her
longed to a series of 500 lithographs bought by Grinncll
alumnus Eric Johnson ‘88 during a trip to Russia. The
lithographs were donated to the college in 1995.

As a curatorial project, “Young Pioneers" broadly inves-
tigates how the agenda ofSocialist Realistic art functioned
as political propaganda. but was ultimately at odds with the
reality of Soviet children’s lives, More speciﬁcally, Dcursch
showcases several socialist Realistic lithographs that port
tray the central and spry_ presence of competitive sport in
the lives of Soviet youth. Represented m tightly Composed
works as well as hold colors, these various scenes present an
otherworldly strangeness in a seemingly unassuming gai-
lery space.

James Cameron's Avatar disappoints
us in all the ways we expect monolithic
blockbustcrs to disappoint usishallow

characters, hackneycd dialogue, implauSIbly‘

grandiose action stunts, etc. lts story takes
place in the near ruturc on a moon called
Pandora. on which a band of Creatures
called the Na’VI liveThe U.S. invades their
land in order to extract a valuable cncrgy
source of theirs called “unobtainium.” The
military sends a marine named Jake (Sam
Worthington) to inﬁltrate the Na'vi CORP
munity in disguise and, much to their cha—
grin, he becomes enrapturcd by the Na’vi
lifestyle and comes to their defense. Yes, the
ﬁlm is cheesy in its oil/Iraq war overtones
and, in its use of“unobtainium,” it borders
on self-parody. However, despite all this.
Avatar also happens to contain unshakcable
and breathtaking imagery brought to life in
whitt is by far the most sophisticated use of
3D technology in the history ofﬁlm. More
than a cold technical exertise, the film wins
us over with the glee or its own inventive
ness and the enthusiasm with which Cams

eron explores his computer-animated uni-
verse.

Simply put, Avatar works for the same
reason star Wars workedithey are, in
many respects, exceedingly shallow rilrns,
However, they succeed simply by doing
what any great film should—showing us
things we’ve never seen or even imagined
before. Pandora has its share ofcliche’s.The
Na’vi people, ror one. are standard Native
American stcrcotypes. However, the detail
of the ﬂora (some or" which illuminates in
bizarre ways at night), the strange creaturcs,
the levitating mountains and gargantuan
treesithis is the kind of richness of detail
that generates legions of cultrsh followers,
losing themselves in Cameron's geeky mys
rhology. For the rest ofus, Cameron's vision
charms in a way that most multimillion-
dollar spectacles do not.

Admutedly. I use the word “us” dcccp—
tively With its mix of technical ambition
and narrative facileness. Avatar is precisely
the kind or movie that alicnates as many
as it wins over. Jamcs Cameron is just the
kind otdirector to make such a polarizing

movie.With Titaniein1997, he Cﬂﬂled out
a meticulous reconstruction of the famous
ship, the film ultimately costing 3200 mils
lion dollars and grossing more than any
ﬁlm ever matle up- until that point. Yet we
all know people, many people. who not only
hate Titanic. but hate it with a proud vens
gcance. i think this dislike may have some
thing to do with the height of Cameron's
ambition. There's something oreputting,
perhaps even vaguely creepy, about a single
man going to such great lengths simply to
entertain us.

There’s also been a more biting critis
Cism of Cameron's ambition, one that sees
hypocrisy in the very substance or his sup—
posed moral vision This is a film about the
dangers of modem technology. The us,
a highly mechanized power system, needs
to terrorize the more naturerattuned and
enlightened Na'VI community in order to
sustain Itself. Ultimately;
advantage over the us. is their connection
wrrh the natural world. Strategically, they
can do more with their understanding of
nature than the US, can with its colossal

tlic Nu'vi's indill'

machines. Now, why does Cameron need to
make a multimillionsdollar technological
extravaganza in order to warn us about the
dangerous and unnecessary extravagance or
modern technology?

That’s a reasonable criticism, but I'd
suggest that Cameron is more aware ofthis
contradiction than he is'given credit for. In
fact. the film rs very much about this con
tradiction. Jake, the story’s hero, needs to
invade and work against the interests orthe
Nu’vi people in order to understand their
moral superiority. In fact, were it not for
the military technology that disguises him
as a Na’vi citizen, he would have had no
access to their community to begin with.
He needs to burrow into the core of U.
military power in order to learn its evils
and move in a new direction, So, do we
need big technology to lcam the evils of
big technology and consider alternatives.)
1 don't want to portray James Cameron as
a profound rnoral thinker, but he spends
more time considering this question than
one might think.
