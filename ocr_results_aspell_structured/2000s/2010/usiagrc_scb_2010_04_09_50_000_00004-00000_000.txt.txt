In the otherwise dim halls of the Grinnell Community
Center, middle school art pieces lit up the second ﬂoor
during its opening reception on March 12, Filling the
room were penguins, rectangles and ﬂowctsiall ofwhieh
invited student artists, family members and passersby in to
View the exhibition.

The art exhibition, featuring around 200 art projects,
was a culmination of the year’s dedication by Grinnell
Middle School art students. The types of artwork varied
greatly in form, from original still life drawings to posters
rniinicking graphic artist M.C, Eschet’s style.

All projects were created under the guidance ofAndrew
Lehn, the art teacher at Grinnell Middle School. Lehn
explained that he considers his middle school art classes as
a transitional stage, where students tine-tune their existing
skills and prepare for more advanced artwork.

“We try to have stepping stones from elementary where
they’re not quite maybe as skilled to high school where
they're going to start adding what the meaning of some
of that stuff is," Lehn said "There’s a boundary but then
there's a lot of choice within the boundary that allows kids
to be creative and do something that they like to do."

The art exhibition was a way to celebrate the students'
creativity and hard work. Lehn explained that a student's

artwork had to receive a 95 percent grade or higher in Q; WHAT HAPPENS WHEN You

order to be displayed in the exhibition, though there were

some exceptions. " MIX HAL z ?
