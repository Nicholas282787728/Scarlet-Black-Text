fBeesl Interest and involvement beyond the

’°'" 9- student level is one ofthe things the group
founders hope to accomplish with the bees. several members
ofthe town ofGrlnnell have approached them hoping to learn
how to keep their own bees.

"Obviously we want the honey," Smith said. “But the main
reason is to provide service to the greater Grinnell community
by pollination but also teaching skills, to everyone who is inter
ested, that can become useful later in life.”

According to Smith and McCalluerook, there is also an
ecological benefit~for the last few decades the number ofbees
has been threatened and the best way to stabilize the popular
tion is to keep bees and ensure their future existence.

Nathan Clubb ’11
runs for office

BY MARCUS EAGAN _

There are more than 150 student organizations for Grinnell
College students to choose from, but one particular club at
Grinnell hopes to garner a lot of attention and support in the
final days of the semester. That club is Nathan Clubb '11, a
rising senior and native of Sigourney, lowa, where he is set to
be the Democratic candidate for the 76th District’s seat in the
Iowa State House.

Clubb brings a working knowledge of American political
systems. as he is majoring in political science, and understands
rural life in Iowa, after growing up in Sigourney~a town of
only 2,200 people just over an hour drive from Grinnell. But
he is still a college student.

“The main reason I’m running is because I see that there
are a lot ofsevere problems hurting rural communities .. [such
as] the declining population, as a result of a lack in opportuni-
ties,"Clubb said. “I have taken extensive economic coursework,
which I think will be very useful in politics. I believe that
there are not enough politicians that have a proper understand-
ing ot’economics.“

To outline his campaign agenda, Clubb proposed the four
principle issues he planned to address when in office. First, he
wants to focus on the creation ofjobs in Iowa. Second, Clubb
stresses the state’s infrastructure needs improvement and that
such action would lead to other solutions. Third, he wants
to improve the state’s education system, continuing positive
strides it has made in recent years. Fourth, Clubb remarked
that, of course, his ﬁrst two propositions would be very expen-
sive, but he does not intend to raise taxes. Instead, he wants to
rerexamine the state‘s budget to determine what expenditures
can be cut to make room for newer policies.

Despite Clubb's party afﬁliation, the Grinnell College
Campus Democrats (GCCD) has, due to the group's policies,
neither endorsed Clubb as their choice [or the 76th District.
not fully committed to working on Clubb‘s campaign.

“We don't formally endorse candidates till after the primas
ry, to ensure that we are endorsing the nominees of the Demos
cratic Party,” said Phil Sletten '11, the COTtl’ia-u of the GCCD.
“While we will be supporters ofNathan we also have a lot
of other races to worry about—including those that directly
affect Grinnell.”

The primary will not be an issue for long though, because
Clubb is running uncontested. Furthermore, Sletten said that
he did, indeed, prefer Clubb to the 76th district’s incumbent,
Republican Betty R. De Boer, Sletten expressed disenchant-
ment with De Boers past service, reﬂecting his broader vision
for the future of Iowa politics.

“Having a mixture ofvoices, especially having young voices,
in the state House is something Grinnell College students
would appreciate,"Sletten said.

Sletten explains that although Clubb is a student at
Grinnell, a member of tlic GCCD, and the candidate Slcttcn
supports for the 76th District, the district does not include the
Grinnell College community, which is the focus ofthe GCCD.
But the district includes Keokuk County, Iowa County and a
signiﬁcant portion ofPoweshiek County, and the issues plagir
ing the two communities seem similar.

Their most similar issue is the lagging agrarian economies
ofboth regions. so as one might expect, the GCCD and Clubb
echoed the Iowa Democratic Party in declaring their unifying
objective: keeping rural economics afloat.

Unofficial student forum responds to BMI

Ev SOLOMON MILLER

About 40 students casually gathered on the second ﬂoor
of the Joe Rosenfleld ‘25 Center last Monday night to discuss
their views on Cunnilingus, a private party that was recently
named a biaSrmotivated incident by the college (see SUB 5m.

This unofﬁcial forum allowed students to talk in small
groups to Lry to understand the views ofothers, especially views
they would not normally encounter. Gretel Carlson ’10 and El-
eanor Nelson ’10 helped facilitate the forum after they were
approached by Jake Thompson '10, Kevin McConnaughay‘lO
and three other male athletes about their response to the incir
dent.

Carlson, Thompson and McConnaughay all wanted to uni
derstand the opinions of each other. Furthermore, they mnted
to give more students an opportunity to have productive, small
group discussions that might be more personal and less intimi—
dating than the official all-campus forum held Thursday

"We felt that we didn’t really have an appropriate avenue
for our voices to be heard,”McConnaughay said. “[The ofﬁcial
forum on Thursday] was such a charged and motivated forum
that we felt there was no way it would be tnily open.”

Carlson also wanted to provide people with a my oftalking
before the official forum,Wl‘iiCh was held nearly two weeks after
the incident occurred.

“People needed something in the interim other than the
rumor mill," Carlson said.

The forum was attended by athletes who also went to the
party, women named on bowls at the party and many other
students with no direct involvement with the incident.-

Allison Wong ’12 was named on a bowl.

“I’ve felt comfortable since the day that l prospied,"Wong
said. “[This incident has] really shaken my trust in the com
munity."

Wong hoped that attending the forum would help her unr
derstand other views on what happened.

"I knew exactly howl felt,"wong said. “Whatl really
was at a loss for was the mindset behind planning the party
or some of the mindsets behind people who had told me it
wasn’t really a big deal.”

Friends! FREE FALAFEL!

A good cause!

Thompson tried to explain.

“1 Can’t condemn the patry,”Thompson said. “I know a lot
ofthe people involved, and almost all of them were just looking
to enjoy some Jell-o shots."

McConnaughay explained students at the party felt they
were in a “safe space," and the humor they uscdiwhich was, he
admitted, at times offensive—would be keptwithin the group.

"People felt like this was an invasion of privacy," he said,
“There are plenty of football players and people at the party
who would have raised these concerns and we would have
done it differently next year."

Though Wong does not agree with some of the comments
she heard, she feels she can better comprehend how most of the
people at the party viewed what happened.

“I do recognize that it’s hard in that situation to really self»
govern," Wong said. ’

Other groups focused on different responses. Carlsons
group discussed, among other things, how prospective students
are chosen.

“It’s not fair to say we don't mnt a certain kind of people
at Grinnell," Carlson said, referring to the idea that athletes
should be judged differently

Overall, Carlson thinks the forum was a success.

“A lot of those groups went upvmrds of an hour," she said.
“I think that that speaks to the kinds of conversations that were
being had."

Wong agreed that the forum ms productive, especially in
terms of involving all who attended.

“I think the small group discussions on Monday allowed
some people to talk who wouldn't necessarily have been able
to use their voice at the forum Thursday,"Wong said. “It was a
respectful place, and everybody was listening."

MeConnaughay appreciated that he could express his oplnr
ion, and even though others disagreed, he appreciated that they
genuinely listened to him.

“I’m looking at a Grinnellian right now and that Grinnellian
is disagreeing with me," he said. “They have a perfect right to
do so."
