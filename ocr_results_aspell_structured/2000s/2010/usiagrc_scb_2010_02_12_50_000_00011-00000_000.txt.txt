If you walked into Ray Obermiller
pool last week, you would be a witness to
a rare sightmdivers diving in swim caps.
If you had asked one of these divers why
they were wearing these swim caps which
they obviously didn’t need, they would
point to a short, unassuming diver in a
gray cap with massive amounts of facial
hair.

His name is Nick Smith ‘10 and his
reason? To protect his dreadlocks from
falling out, The other divers simply folr
lowed his practical and fashionable lend.

Smith and,the rest of the class of‘lO
will'be leading the Grinnell Men’s and
Women’s Swimming and Diving teatn to
the Midwest Conference Championship
this weekend in Appleton, Wisc. It will
be the-ﬁnal meet fol: Smith and his felt
low seniors,who have never lost a Chamn
pionship in their four years at Grinnell.
Nick joined the team to follow the lead
of his brother, Garnet Smith ‘08, who
was alreadyon the team.

"I decided to join the team because I
had done diving in high sehool,i already
had a brother on the team, and ljust res
ally liked the people," smith said.

originally a gymnast, Nick discovered

diving in high school at the suggestion of'

his brother. After watching a practice and
chatting with the diving team during a
college visit, Nick knew that he wanted
to be part of the tea'm Since then, Nick

has become nothing more than one ofthe -_
lnost loved and crucial pants of the team, ' '

Despite Nick’s sort-spoken demeanor,
the team feels his presence because he
leads by example. Nic . .woothe 10.0:me-
ter and 300 meter dive events at confer
ence last year, while performing second
only to his brother the rim: years before
that. In addition to his many successes,
Nick's background in gymnastics and
his experience in learning how to dive
helped him become a better teacher for
a team composed of inexperienced din
ers, some ofwhom converted'ftom other
sports just like him. ' ,
“Nick is an individual who came to
diving from gymnastics, which is com-
mon." said Tim Hammond, the Assis-
tant Swim Coach, “But he didn't grow
up diving. He learned a lot about diving
his ﬁrst year and he became more reﬁned
year after year. It’s interesting to seehim
mature and coach the younger divers."
Diver Charlie Kessner ‘12 came to
Grinnell as a soccer player but converted
into a diver. Under the guidance ofNick
smith, Kessner emerged as a skilled diver.
“My friend from the soccer team and
I were asked to be on the diving team
and we came in not knowing anything

but over the last year, Nick and Mark Sula
livan [‘10] have helped me immensely," said
Kessner. Nick‘s positive attitude has really
encouraged me to become a better diver."
Max Fulgoni ‘12 has watched Nick
demonstrate his.abillty to bring the team
together and provide support {or his team-
mates. Nick's successes have been an in~
strumental part of the team’s victories,
“He qualiﬁed for nationals," Fulgoni
said.“He gets a lotorpoinrs and makes the
[swimmers] job a lot easier, He's been realr
1y good (or divers for getting them together
and has been really loud during swim races

Nick’s achievements deﬁnitely left a
mark on the history ofGrinnell swimming.
"That's his name on the record board,"
said Bill Mogav‘ero ‘12. “Hopefully he’ll
break that record this year. Maybe he can
go to Nationals this year.”
Nick’s outstanding skills will be
invaluable for the quest for another pair

of Midwestern Conference titles. Both the
men's and women’s teams have enjoyed long
reigns defending their titles for the 8th and
11th times respectively. ‘

“I expect the team to swim really
well." Panl Gagne ‘10 said, “its expected
that we should win again, looking at the
stats»sl‘leet.We'd like to do rcallywell in the
relays and have a good time,"

_ Although the women's team has won 3
more conference titles than the men’s team

in the last 11 years, they face a more come '

petitivc challenge, to regain the title this
year. '

“This is only my third year at Grinnell

in their ability. That's what going to help
them come out on top."

Members of the team consistently
pointed to the siae and the depth of the
team as the driving forces behind their-
long histoty or success.

“The team expects to win. i expect to‘

Student-athletes run "R-word’ campaign

Bit MATTHEW BACHTELL ‘ ,
The “Spread the Word to End the Word" movement, a
national push to eliminate the derogatory use of the word
‘retard', came to Grinnell this month. The entire athletic
department participated in the R—Word campaign, in re,
sponse to a challenge from the commissioner of the Mid-
west Conference (MWC) to rally support for the cause.
“We decided to make it a competition between the
schools to see who could get the most pledges," said Mi—
chael Cole ’12, Student Athletic Advisory Council (SAAC)
Representative. -
A speaker from the special Olympics promoted the
movement at an MVVC‘SAAC meeting in November,
“Our primary goal is to raise awareness of the great
campaign that was put together by the special Olym-
pics, to encourage people to think twice when using the

‘R-wotd’ in.slang or everyday speech, and to foster respect

.and inclusion ofthose people with intellectual disabilities,"

Cole‘wrote in an e-mail.

TheR-Word campaign ran from Monday, Feb. 1, to
Friday; Feb. 12. During this time, MWC schools were
charged with getting as many students, faculty, staff and
community members to pledge support for the R-Word
campaign.

SAAC contributed to the cause by selling Tsshirts with
campaign slogans outside ofthe dining hall and by putting
up posters around campus. The proceeds of the Tsshltts
will go to the Special Olympics

Sports teams were involved-as well. The basketball
teams wore the RrWord campaign shirts for warm-ups
during the challenge period.

As a result oftllc Grinnell campaign and across the nor

tion, support for the campaign seems to be spreading.As of
Feb. 10, over 59,000 people have pledged support through
promotion of the website, wwwrysmaydmg. Students
who pledged were asked to indicate that they were from
Grinnell, so that their pledges could be tracked and tallied.

“We probably won’t know [the number of Grinnell stun
dents who pledged] until the end of the campaign," said
Lia Davis '11, SAAC Representative. “Right now thoughI
would say there’s at least one hundred, and I’m sure there‘s
mllny more.“

The pledges will be counted by February 19. and the
College with the most pledges will receive a 5250 price and
will be recognized in a ceremony at the ch Men's and
Women's Basketball tournaments. .
