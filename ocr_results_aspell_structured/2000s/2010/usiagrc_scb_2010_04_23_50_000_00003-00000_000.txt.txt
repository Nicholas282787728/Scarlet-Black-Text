2010-2011 SGA Cabinet positions finalized

EV MATT BACHTELL

With the spring semester coming to a close, next year’s
SGA cabinet has bccn finalized. Approved at this week's Joint
Board for the 2010-2011 academic year. Vice President of
Student Affairs (VPSA) and next year's SGA President, Ben
Offenberg '11 is excited to work with all new members of the
cabinet, including Concerts Chair, Student Service Coordinate
tor and Films Chair.

“It s a more diverse cabinet than we ve had In previous years.
one example is right now irsso percent female which hasnt
happened' in my recent memo'ry, nor anyone in cabinets recent
memory, Offenberg said.

Offenberg is one of two returning SGA cabinet members,
along with Gabe Schechter ’12, who will be next year's Treat
surer. Liting Cong '11, next year's Vice President ofAcademic
Affairs (V'PAA), and Graciela Guzman '11, next year's Vice
President of Student Affair (VPSA), round out the executives,
all of whom carenilly chose the cabinet nominees.

“Now,I think that the cabinet that Ben [Offenberg],]oanna
[DeMars] and I put together Will echo on throughout the ages
as the best ofall time, bur 1 think these guys will come close,"
said SGA President Harry Krejsa'lo.

The first conﬁrmed nominee was Elizabeth Maltby'll for
the position of Administrative Coordinator (AC), Since the
AC has to supervise Joint Board, and understand the extensive
ins and outs of SGA, Maltby’s extensive experience with stu-

dent government made her an appealing nominee.

“She was the previous election board chair, she's seen the ins
ner worlting of SGA during its most stressful and complicated
times, and has lived to tell about it,”said Offenberg of Maltby,
who is studying abroad this semester.

Kathy Andersen ’13, a CND Senator who expressed an ear»
1y interest in working with the SGA, was nominated to replace
Schechter as Assistant Treasurer. who will become Treasurer
next year.

“She is an incredibly intelligent, and organized, and driven
person, and has been agront senator," Krejsa said. “The Ase
sistantTreasurer is again going to be the youngcst member of
cabinet. a rising ﬁrst year like we had last year."

Que Newbill ’12 accepted the nomination to the post of
Student Service Coordinator because of his extensive back-
ground community service Sinee the position is fairly now, he
does not plan on introducing changes to current policy.

“I guess my focus will be more building on Alex Peitz [’10]
and everything that she’s done, because she did a really good job
and she’s still the current student service coordinator,” Newbill
said, “Any recommendation she has is something I'd consider."

Newbill has been shadowing Peita since applying to ra-
miliarize himself with the inner working s of SGA, and has a
thorough understanding of the responsibilities of the service
Coordinator.

The nominee for Films Coordinator is Courtney Sheelian
'11, an independent ﬁlm studies major who has participated in
both the Films Committee and the Cultural Films Committee,
has plans to promote greater diversity in SSA Films. Shechan
also hopes to produce frequent extensive reviewing offilms for
the S83

“1 have an issue with the fact that the vast majority otthe
ﬁlms shown in the last two years by SGA Films have been
directed by white American men by an almost embarrassing
majority, so I will actively change that ratio," Sheehan said.

The Concerts Chair nominee, Nic Wilson ’12, like Sheer
han, was very involved in his field, having been a part of the
Concerts Committee since the beginning of his first year at
Grinnell. While he acknowledges the excellent work of his
predecessors, he plans to take steps to ensure that younger stu-
dents involved in Concerts receive the necessary experience to
maintain that high standard.

“I’d also like to take advantage of Pioneer Web to get more
input from the student body in general, in terms of who Cone
certs brings to Grinnell,"Wilson said.

Tasha Popkin '11 will be the All Campus Events Coordinae
tor (ACE) for next year. Popkin could not be reached in time
for publication.

All nominations for the SGA cabinet were ﬁnalized
Wednesday night at this week's Joint Board.
