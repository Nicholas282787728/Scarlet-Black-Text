 

Find serenity at Merrill Park

BY KATHERINE CHUNG

Just blocks away from campus, Merrill Park provides a serene environment for a quick study
break on a sunny day or a chance to relive childhood memories on the play structuresThough
oddly shapedia road curves through the middle of the pane dividing the park in two—there is
plenty of space for all visitors to enjoy the park. The east side of the park features a playground,
a swing set, and a gazebo—all generously sized There are also plenty of picnic tables spread
throughout the grassy knolls—good for both large parties and intimate nature dates. The west
side of the park offers similar amenities, as well as a baseball diamond. The park is home to a
number of sturdy looking trees, suitable for some climbing fun.Though the park's squirrel popu
lation seemed rather sparse, the park has ﬂocks ofbirds chirping and squawking on the premises.

 

 

 

 

Spot the elusive “squeaver” at
James Miller Park

BY MATT BACHTELL

The haggard Grinnellians stepped off the railroad tracks and beheld the blue of: large ﬁshr
ing pond—the centerpiece otJarnes Miller Park. They happily made a beeline for the waterfront,
only to be faced with a carefully unconcealed sign that read Private Property, monitored by video
surveillance Apparently someone who is slightly paranoid owns one halfafthe lake.

The park itself was pleasant and sunny after trudging through some perplexingly swampy
lawn. At the north end, there is a set of two swings and a springy squeaver—a kind of beaver/
squirrel hybrid that attracts small children and College students. Scattered throughout were
apparatuses for Frisbee golf. To the south, past a stately lane shaded by trees, were a couple of
pavilions, a play castle, a merry-go-round, and more swing sets. Smiling, the students thought
that a carefree afternoon lay ahead.

Then, disaster—james Miller Park is home to a population ofpassive—aggressive geese.

Visit Arbor Lake Park for scenic history

BY]. FRANCIS BUSE

Sure, Arbor Lake may not be as swimmahle as its Great cousins (read: Michigan, Superior, et al)
but it's still a nice secluded park, not far from a relatively tnﬂicked and urban part ofGi-innell.

A more-or-less green colored lake surrounded by trees, Arbor Lake’s suongesl suit is its wide nail
around the lake that seems to be made for that crappy hybrid Z4—gear your parents bought you at
Walmart as a graduation present. Kyou don't wish to bike, or can’t, take a nice walk towards it down
the west side ofGrinnell and hike around the lake, sit on one ofthe nice benches and give the obstacle
course a cry ifyou are feeling adventurous.

Arbor Lake neighbors the calmebyeday, spooky-bynighr Hazelwood Cemetery Obviously, if
you decide to visit the hilly and silent cemetery, be respeccnil, and don't“idle or loararound," both or
which are prohibited by the City ofGrinnell, according to a brochure published about the grounds by
the city. ms more~thanvhundredryearold cemetery is a beaunful and historic gem to scroll through
while contemplating life, eternity, love and the grave otJosrah B. Gnnnell.
