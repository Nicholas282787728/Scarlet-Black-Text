Jess the nan-brotherhood

l am non-college affiliated and recently saw
a poster ar Drake library advertising a "Jess the
Brotherhood" concert in Gardner, 4/10, 9 pin.
Figuring this was an open invitation I went to
the location and found the doors locked so thatI
could not get in. A suggestion: if you want town
people at an ovenr, make sure doors are open or
people are nearby who are willing to open the
door (there were people there who saw me at the
door, but they did not open the door.)

Students speak
about what’s on
their minds in
426 142 words or
fewer, and you’re
invited! If you
have a rant, e~
mail it to
[sargenta]. Com-
plainingjn a public
forum‘ is always
more fun than do-
ing it alone.

Sloppy jaes, not sloppy drunks

Dear Sloppy Drunks In rhe D-Hall,

1 am totally cool with you girls having a drunk
dinner in the middle ofthe week and I, as a previv
ous drunk dinner attendee, even support your cause.
However, learn to hold your liquorl There is no need
to be falling over in the middle or the dining hall,
stumbling into people and literally pushing past
people on ornrehes without a look back. I honestly
don't care how drunk you are.Jusr be considerate of
those around you and don't impede on their lives
even if your drunk ass can: stand up. Happy drink-

THE PA R

Spnng is ﬁnally hereiand so is warm
weather! Whar are some green ways to
keep cool? To prevenr using energy, open
windows, have cold drinks, or take a cold
shower before bed to eonrrol your temper-
ature. Try using a fan instead of air con,
dilionlng, but if you do use an conditione
ing, try not to set the temperature [00 low.
Also, don’t keep it on all the time; instead,
keep it on long enough to cool the room
down and then shut it off, or turn the tem-
perature up.

More than a drink container

Last Sunday morning at a proximately 1

only to be told that he could not leave with “that

“That drink container" was the Colonel's
CHICKEN BUCKET! What is Colonel Sand-
ers without his bucket?!?l The Colonel tried to
bypass security,bur an overzealous ACE security
person cruelly ripped the bucket from his hands.
The Colonel understands the need for safety and
security on this campus, but this is an outrage.
