Grand slam
wins it for
basebaH

Ev DARWIN MANNlNc

Last Saturday, Grinnell clinched home
ﬁeld advantage tor the Confcrcncc tournar
mcnt, though it came in a fashion no one
could have anticipated. They did it win-
ning 10 o in ten innings against their rivals
Monmouth They then went on to sweep
the days doubl chcadcr and improve their
record to 10v0 in Conference play. wmning
the second game 12—2.

Despite the numbers, the game they
clinched was anything but painless. Going
into the bottom of the tenth inning down
5-4, more than a little doubt trickled into
the Grinnell clubhouse. However, the urn
ease was promptly trumped as center ﬁeld
er Matt Skelly ’12 got things rolling with a
solid single, which was quickly followed up
with a pair ofbasc hits. A wild pitch and
walk to right ﬁelder Paden Roder ’10 tied
the score and loaded the bases,

With that walk the stage was set. and
with one smooth swing of the bat by DH
Nate Pierce '10 and one grand slam later it
was all over. The fat lady had indeed sung
and Grinnell's men were the victors. Pierce
could barely believe his eyes, but more im—
portantly he had to run around the bases,
awaiting the chance to be at the center of
the volcano of ballplayers that erupted the
second he touched home plate.

1 was surprised more than anything,
when I hit I thought it was just going to
be a sacriﬁce ﬂy ball, but when it got over
the fence I was just really excitcdnjt's hard
to put into words," Pierce said. “The situ-
ation that I got into where I had the bases
loaded, was a great spot for me as a hitter,
because 1 knew the pitcher had to come af-
ter me, allowing me to just put the ball in
play."

Propelled by this euphoric conﬁdence,
the team \vlll look to continue their wave of
superb baseball this weekend. Saturday they
travel to Monmouth for a doubleheader, I
and 3:30 p.mt. and then play one game on
Sunday against central College at 2 pm. at
home. “I think we can win every game and
more importantly, I know we will compete
to win every game for that is one of our
goals and our approach in every game," said

The squad will also be looking to pre
serve perfection in Conference play, can
tinuing their season of uncharted grand
heights. "I believe this is one of the best
if not the best Gtinncll team that has ever
played here," said Pitcher Marshall Chavez
"10.1 had a brother on the team in the past
and Grinnell baseball has certainly came a
long way from in the past having kids who
hadn’t even played baseball in high school
to now having an incredible team loaded
with depth."

This amazing season may be due to
the maturity ot the senior group Pierce
weighed in on how he thought, when on
tering Gnnnell as a ﬁrst-year, that when
his class reached their senior year, there was
deﬁnitely the prospect ofhaving a truly un—
forgettable season.

That said the team has not been able to
make it out of the Conference tournament
since he's been here, but he looks for things
to change. “we havent got over that hump

[winning conference] and I think with the
team we have, we can finish 1270 in Con-
ference play and win it all," Pierce said.

Now that the boys know they'll be hosts
ing ‘the show' they plan to bring plenry of
champagne for everyone in attendance, and
that includes the guys in the banana and
Gumby suits. “While we may have some of
the rowdiest fans in the Conrerence they
always give us something to laugh about
especially when guys are dressed up as
Gumby and a banana itjust keeps us very
light hearted," said left ﬁelder Greg suryn
'11.

In addition to having the home crowd,
they will also enjoy the chance to play the
tournament on their home tutﬂ They know
that if there is even n bit ofwind, they can
poke the ball upwards and see it ﬂy over the
left field wall, or if there isn't then they can
shoot for the gap between right and center
and put the wheels on, explained suryn.

"We have such .1 great ﬁeld that was [0*
tally revamped last year, we know how the

AMI helium

ball is going to bounce, how its going to
roll, which will allow us to give up less er»
tors and not give the other team an extra
out," Sury'n said.

Observing these key advantages, the
team also knows the tournament will be
anything but a walk in the park. They will
face stellar teams our of the North Divi-
sion, such as St. Norbert and Ripon. How-
ever, another good piece of news is that
the other team coming out of the South
Division will be Illinois College, a team
Grinnell has defeated four times this sea-
son.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle wont be
the teams they face, but balancing all the
pressures that come with the end of a see
mestcr. “The biggest obstacles we face are
ourselves, end of year studies and time
management, But, baseball is baseball and
we will have them prepared for whatever
opponent we face," Hollibaugh said,
