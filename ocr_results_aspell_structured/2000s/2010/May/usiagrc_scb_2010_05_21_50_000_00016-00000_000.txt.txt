i ﬁrst encountered zyme Burris when
stumbling into the Grill late one Saturday
night in the hopes of procuring a crispy chicken
sandwich for my drundiies. After some sluned
steps and incomprehensible mumblings,l found
my way to the counter and began a longwinded,
terribly ineloquent order. When i ﬁnishedl
looked up at the person across the counter with
an apologeeic, well-you—
knowthat-this-is—like _
kind of smile, expecting " ..
an amused (maybe even ‘
warm) chuckle in return. I
was wrung Standing across
the counter in from of me
was an ediﬁce of a man:
back straight, aims folded, eyes icy, packer hat.
I was taken aback I straightened myself, shook
oirand gulped. Dead silence. More concisely,I
repeated “ ...A crispy chicken sandwich, please?"
Still, no answer. After a few more seconds of
unbearable tension, 1 conceded my post and, tail
between my legs, made my way back to my room
urmourishrd. Before I left though I was sure to
check the nametag ofhe who mwaned my well-
laid plan. But,ofcourse: Zyme.

As it turns out, my experience in the Grillwns
not an isolated incident. The Facebook group,
“ZymeBurrisDoesn’t ServeChickenSandwich-s,
He Serves Knuckle Sandwiches,"boasts over 100
members—all celebrating "our most beloved and
disgruntled grill worker." Although, Lharikﬁilly, it
has never come to ﬁsticuffs, Zyme has gamﬂu‘l
quite a bit of notoriety for his unique build of
customer service and left many curious about his
occupational philosophy . ,

“The ﬁrst two years they only had student
managers working weekends and we were 0pm
until 2 [a.m.] and had an hour of clean up so
we were here until 3 [a.m,]," explains Burris.
"And I usually worked the Friday and Saturday
night shifts because no one else would. During
this period since I was the only one working,
I was also student manager: I was in conuol of

everything and I had to
put up with a lot of Harris

parties People were very
dmnk, very wasted, very
high, or some combination
ofall those. I’ve had people
just throwing P-Cards at
me. i was like it's really not
going to matter what I say or do to these people
because they’re going to take it no matter what.
so I knew I could kind of get away with it sol
started tightening the iron grip."

Into his second year, however, Grill
management began cracking down and slowly
Burris privileges were snipped away Now, Burris
takes on the less visible role of chef, making
Saturday night a lot less ofan interesting time for
both he and the famished drunk.

With service employee probably no longer in
the cards, what does Ennis—an English-history
double major from North Bend, Oregon—plan
to do when he graduates, Lhcn?

“I’m going to be writing and trying to get
published. Mainly the ﬁrst four months I’m
going to be doing that and then my loans are
going to start kicking in so I’m going to start
looking for part time jobs to get rid ufthose until
rhe publishing gets together." , _ , , . , , , ,

While for most, getting published may
sound like a lofty expectation right out ofcollege,
burns has already seen two of his completed
novels printed by Grinnell Press and has had
interut expressed to him by large publishing
houses. His series of young adult fantasy novels,
“The Coulacenee of Contradiction Cycle,” has
become a mailroom {avorire,as proven again this
Thursday when book two, In Punm'l a/Reanvr,
came out and was swallowed up by rhe Grinnell
campus. .

“The two novels that have been published at
Grinnell are the two that are likely to see Print
The ﬁrst one was/1 Captain} gum, it’s for about
the age range of Harry Penn, but then Harry
Potter blossomed to a bundi ofothet people. But
I’d say 12, to 17, or 18-ymr-olds. It started out as
a bedtime story and then 1 got caught up init and
just started writing drawing on various inﬂuences
from Lewis Canoll to Tolkien. And then also
Hem ofDm/l’tlm, Hum/e1, other major literary
works that people generally see irthey read rhe
books. Ijust really like to create new worlds, new
places."

New worlds and new places may not be so
hard for Bun-is to conjure next year, as he leaves
Gnnnell and small town Oregon and heads to
“some large west coast town" where ﬁ'iends will
be vaiting to put him up. As we conclude our
interview on his home turf in the Grill, the
normally straight-heed Burris becomes visibly
reﬂective and nostalgic about his time here. So
what does the verbose, original and fantastical
author have to say about the last four years as he
prepares to leave?
