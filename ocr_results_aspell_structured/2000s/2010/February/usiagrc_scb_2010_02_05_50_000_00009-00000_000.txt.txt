Haling from the ballet
Mecca of San Francisco,
LINES visrted Grinnell
as one of the last stops on
their domestic tour. LINES
represented the 'dance ele-
ment of Grinnell‘s Com—
mittee for Public Events
season, which brought Bela
Fleck and the St. Lawrence String O‘uar-
tet to the college last semester.

The committee brings in a ballet com-
pany every other year, but this year was
marked by its shift not just to a domess
ticiverses Russianicompany, but also by
the company s contemporary 'nature.

LINES delivered with a two-part
show that broke as many classical forms
as it honored. Dancers struck perfectly
achieved arabesques and then literally
turned them on their heads in lift combis
nations which challenged gender roles and
the limits of the physical body. _

The first work, Signs and Wonders,
featured African a capella accompaniment
and was set in
1995 for the
Dance The
ater of Har-
lem.

Beginning
with a short
solo by the
leggy Scotts
Gilbert, much
of the piece
was supported
by the sounds
of children’s voices. The dancers moved in
much the way children sing to themselves,
with' a kind of stunning inhibition and
personal, physical unabashed enjoyment.

in contrast, as the piece developed, the

_ voices themselves matured, and the overall
tone took on a layered complexity. A Pas
.de Deux between Caroline Rocher and

stiffness of classic ballet lines and leaned

the push»pull sharing of force between the
dancers. Unlike a tango, however, Rocher’s
eyes never met zayas'. LINES’ onstage

Whitmore played the puppeteer directing
Harvey first by his head, then by an in-
visible set of strings, as he writhed with
deceivingly superb control across the low
light of the stage.

Sings and Wonders was the company's
older piece and arguably weighricr of the
two as regards cultural context. Fifteen
years later, and presented as a compilation
as opposed a standalone work, much of
that inﬂuence was no longer explicit?
perhaps at some cost to the audience’s
connection to the piece.

Additionally, King’s decision to keep
his female dancers en pointe, despite the

highly modern and phys—
ically challenging nature
of the piece was. perhaps,
questionable. The come
party's female dancers, ale
beit equally lithe, seemed
ham-tied next to their
male counterparts. Sings
called for some extremely
fast, staccato footwork,
which read forced when
the dancers were, well,
forced to perform it on
the flats oftheir tractionless pointe shoes.

Lest the non-traditional music and
variously gendered partnerings speak too
loudly, make no mistake: this is still ballet.
The dancers were impressively muscled,
but still rail thin and the female choreogs
raphy still felt most comfortable in par?
nered, lift-centered, work.

Yes, LINES is still very much a bale
let company, but more than that, it's boy
ballet. King makes full and impressive use
of an ensemble composed, perhaps inten-
tionally, of a mere four women, to its six
men.

Even so, if the boys looked good in
King’s earlier work, Signs and Wondersi
where the movements were characters
i'zed by a yawn-stretch quality of luxuri»
ous freedom that left the girls looking
like powerfully winged ﬂamingos unable
to take flight-everyone looked good in
his more recent, classically accompanied.
piece Dust and Light.

Dust and Light demonstrated an ad»
vancemcnt‘ in Kings ability to speak di»
i-cctly to his audience, no matter the ex-
ternal context. 1f the few male to male
pmtnerings in Signs were remarkable,
they werc status quo when sci against
Dust and Lights female pairwwho lifted
each other time and time again without so
much as a blink—not to mention the men
in skirts.

The company was costumed in either
ephemeral, gauzy white or ﬂashy metallic,
mirroring the alternatively ethereal choral

COURTNEY Moon:

to twangy, classical harpsichord accompa-
niment. And while all the ladies sported
classiciif elegantly simpleidresses, half
the hearty portion of the male ensemble
was costumed in ﬂouncy minis. At one
point a shorter man-in—sk‘irt partnered the
astonishingly tall, gold hot-panted, Scott-
Gilbert in a brilliant, effortless continuas
tion of a classic ballet partner’s lift/turn

’ assist role.

Dust and Light was also, arguablyr
more choreographically consistent as well
as more complex in its use oflight—which
occasionally made the dancers appear to
move around the stage in a sort of void.
The dancers, too, seemed more inclined to
this newer piece and threw themselves to
its sometimes fiercely quick choreography
with reckless—well, artfully reckless—

abandon.

Lacking the gendered roles and strict
forms, but none of the sheer height and
momentary weighrlcssness oficap, associ»
ated with classical ballet, LINES brought
some of us to tears with no story line at
all.
