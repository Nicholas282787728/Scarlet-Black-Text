oopsw'e ngairn We played with rhe rules. Got lost
«in the game. 0 baby. While we didn’t {nil in love with some
-ovcrly romantic tenybopper, w_'e have deﬁnitely put ourselves
into an equally uncomfortable situation After months of stu-
dents smoking in Cleveland and theirsiurultaneous ignoring
‘ of: rts to stop smoking in Ckveland—oncc‘againﬁecu-
;- j ‘ now bc-pattolling in the Cleveland lounges to make
surethat no one is smoking in Cleveland.

. And before your hands get caught above your head, there
are a few things that we should keep in mind. By smoking on
campus,wc arehrcakingctate law and there is’nothin that we

. can do about it beyond pctirioningGovemor Chuck ulver or

holding an overly reactionary and time wasting protest. It also
means.that the college can 'do nothing about it on our behalf.
Second1y,we have. to remember that as a result of breaking the
law oonstantlywc are constantly penalized when we do smoke
in Cleveland. Some students discovered this when FM sent
Jamaland a bill, and the College discovered this when the state
sent them a hefty ﬁne. And you thought the taxes on your soft
pack ofMarlboro crtncer sticks was steep.

Finally, this situation is like Dejn vu. Students went
through this last year and perhaps out of shock, perhaps out of
understanding and empathy, the students curbed their smok-
ing habits. In other words, given the proper motivation we can
act the way the college needs us to nct, it is simply a matter of
which motivation wo‘rks.

The point is we’re not that innocent. Britney Spears knew
it, and we can’t deny it. We need to take some responsibility

After the party

The most frequent question I was asked over Winter
Break was not “Are you wearing a fake beard?" but “Did you
hear the This American Life story about Penn State as the #1
party school in the country?” _

I went to Penn State for graduate school, and because a
number of friends from my high school were undergraduates
there, I visited PSU a number oftimes while I was in college.

Having witnessed, and perhaps on the rare occasion contrib-,

utcd to; its culture of fun, I was not surprised by its selection
as the #1 party school. ' .

I remember my ﬁrst visit to Penn State surprisingly well.
It was during my junior year or college
and I thought I had tound Undergradu-
ate Heaven. There were pizza shops and
sports bars on every corner in downtown
State College, everybody on the street
was between 18 and 22, and all anyone
wanted to do was have a good time. No
wonder it attracts so many students who
remain ﬁercely loyal to their almn mater tor the rest of their
lives: it’s a place to create wonderﬁll fuzzy memories.

I am proud to he a Penn State alum. I received excel-
lent graduate training from great protessors,l made a lot of
friends and I participated in some epic tailgates before at-
tending what I’m told were very good football games.

So did I hear (he This American Life story about PSUas

. #1 party school? Yeah, I did. And I hated it.

The designation of the #1 party school in the country is
a badge othono‘r worn by many undergrads and some alums,
but it can cause embarrassment to those who recognize that
the value ofa degree from any institution depends highly on
that schools reputation. ‘

When I was on the job market, I almost didn’t apply to
Grinnell because, having lived my life on the east coast, 1 had
never heard of the college and l thought that everything 1

Controlling wheré g‘fts go

Compared to other schools, our alums don't give as much
“b'ack”to tlreirschool after their tuition payments are through—
according to the US News and World Report, Grinnell alums
give back at a rate of43 percent, n small number com-
pared to colleges such as Carloton’s 64 percent.
Over the past few years, senior Challenge has
attempted to reverse this trend by asking soon—
torbergraduates to donate whatever paltry sum
they can scrounge up to the College’s Pioneer E
Fund. And, as one could guess, the Challenge
is often left undlallenged by students~lmd, \

Field warrant. It was only because a Grinnellian who was
also at Penn State told me that Grinnell was, in fact, a very
good school that I decided to send in my application.

Shortly after I accepted the position, I met someone who
told me that one of her coworkers had attended Grinnell.
“Did she like it?"l asked."0h yeah,"cam: the reply. “She said
she smoked a lot ofweed,”

By the time I had that conversation, I had already learned
a lot about the college and had visited the campus during the
interview process. The‘students I met struck me as thoughtt

- ﬁll, intelligent and an,
gagcd, so I knew I wasn't
taking a job at what was
simply the academic
equivalent of a Cheech
and Chong movie.

But the fact that this
was the deﬁning char-
actcristic of Grinnell College for someone only marginally
familiar with the school strikes me as problematic, unfair and
unfortunate,just as the #1 party school designation can give
outsiders a rather skewed view of Penn State.

When a student submits a resume for consideration, his
or her college typically appears on the top line. If the po-
tential‘ employer recognizes the college as a respected and
highly—ranked institution of higher learning, that is a huge
plus. It’ the potential employer wonders whether 3.24 is the
applicant’s GPA or B.A.c., that's not good.

Never mind what national rankings say or what people
connected to the school know to be true about its academic
rigor—in the real world, what matters is reputation.

This is why it is so important for students to represent
and exemplify the best aspects of Grinnell to people they
encounter off-campus and to the visitors they meet on cam—

 

-The Money

February 5, 2010

used for more or less anything on campus.And so every dollar
that a senior—or alum, for that matter—drops in response to
the challenge disappears into the gray abyss of the college’s
accounting. Without a connection to the use of those ‘greens,’
it‘s easy to understand why someone would not want to part
with a substantial part ofrheir income.

That’s why we applaud recent news that the College is
considering caning some ofthe Red Ta e on “restricted" gifts,
.or donations that go directly to a specidi: cause on campus, as
chosen by the giver: Currently, one cannot donate less than
:10 or more than £100 to a speciﬁc thing, and the senior
Challenge funds to the “unrestricted” funds. But, it” re-
posed plans to malt: restricted giving more boundless an die
rect the Senior Challenge there, the College will make several
important steps. ,

First of all, the school will get the money they so o'ften
complain that they don’t get Alums would donate to the or-
ganizations and nebulous ideals that they embodied during

mater matters

pusThrs rs why students should have a vested interest in not
voting themselves #1 party school or making the availability
ofwced part ofits social gospel. _

This is not to say that students need to shun intoxicants
or that he colleges and universities need to police the so~
cial act' tics ofits students, I’m not trying to harsh anyone’s
mellow here.

And this doesn’t mean that you can't rcgale your non-
Grinncuian friends with stories from. 10/10 or Hundred
Days or the time your team lost to the Sparkle Ponies at
Grinnell Relays (and you will lose again this year, mark my
words).

My point is that how we articulate our values as members
ofa particular institution has consequences and we should be
very much aware of that. Listening to the NPR story about
Penn State demonstrated that many students mistakenly
think they’re serving the greater good by advertising PSU as
a place in which beer consumption and public urination rake
precedence over, rather than coexist with, academics and so»
cial serviceThis might make a college seem enticing to other
teenagers, but it’s less impressive to those who will review
applications for jobs, fellowships or graduate school.

I feel like Grinnellians do a very good job of representing
themselves and the College, and I only want thnt to continue.
I've come to know Grinnell as a place where students work
their asses off for their education and selfrgov themselves off
their asses when they need a break, and I get that. But when
it comes time to prepare the face you meet to meet the faces
that you meet, all I ask is that you put your best face forward. ,

Grinnell College deserves wider and greater recogn‘r
tion as one of the country’s finest liberal arts institution—
it doesn’t need to be recognized as the #1 Party School in
Poweshiek County', even if that title has also been earned.
