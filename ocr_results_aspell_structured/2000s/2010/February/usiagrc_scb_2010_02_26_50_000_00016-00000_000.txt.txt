1999: Wish we were still partying like it was. And
wish Will Smith still entertained us on our Discmen.
And wish gas cost $.99 a gallon,

 

1996: We were all in our glory years, but we also all
probably soiled'our pants or threw up on someone
at school Oh, the humanity!

Olympics deserve a' gold medal

Joe “Torch-of-Op ression” Hiller’s rant in
last week: 58:13 provi ed a very narrow view of
the Olympics, Sure, any elite sporting event in:
volves invesnng large amounts of rime, money
and energy into nonessentials. So do the arts,
ﬁreworks displays and brewing kombucha. Not
only do the Olympics maintain a historicnl tra-
dition of celebrating hard work and athletic ex-
cellence, they also foster an international com,
munity where countries set aside their political
differences and engage in friendly competition.
Especially as someone who participates in sports,
isn't it exciting to see people excel at such a high
level or mental nnri physical prowess? And may
be by watching the Winrer Olympics we can
get male ideas ubcur how to enjoy all this dnrnn
snow!

Get off the lazy train...

“.0! I'll push you oer.

The dining hall is a magical, wonderful place
where people run eat, socialize and get paid
WELL ABOVE minimum wage to do VERY
EASY worlc Many people around the world and
in our own town work their proverbial asses off
every day in difﬁcult, manual labor jobs to get
paid minimum wage while some of the work
study employers at the dining hall get by wirh
doing as little work as possible. Many people
that have never had to work a day in their lives
take advantage of Lyle's kindness and seeming
inability to ﬁre people by not clocking outwhen
rhey are off duty and worst of ill, not doing jack
shin: during their shifts and leaving the employ
ecs rim need as mnny houls is possible to pick
up the slack,
