Smith Gallery curated to match Faulconer

 

BYMARGARETALLEN

The small room located next to the en-
trance of the dining hall, formally known
as The Smith Gallery, is currently dis~
playing an exhibit that responds to the
studentecurated exhibit “Repeat, Reveal,
React: Identities in Flux,” in Faulconer
Gallery. The Faulconer exhibit, curated by
the Art Exhibition Seminar, is a presenta—
tion of artwork that reﬂects the themes of
identity and repetition also present in the
Faulconer show.

The Art Exhibition Seminar, which is
offered once every three years, gives stu-
dents the opportunity to curate, publicize
and present their own exhibit for Faulcon-
er Gallery. Under the guidance of Profese
sor Jenny Anger, the 11 students enrolled
in this class spent last semester selecting
artwork from the Grinnell College collec-
tion that responded the themes of iden-
tity and repetition, Other responsibilities
included installing the display, publishing
the exhibits catalog and constructing a
similar exhibit in the Smith Gallery.

According to Amanda Underwood
’10, Smith Gallery’s appropriation of
Faulconer’s' exhibit reﬂects “a call and re-
sponse" from the students, to the students.
Submissions for The Smith Gallery came
from various students representing differ—
ent class years and artistic style.

For Danny Penny ’13, the Smith ex-
hibit gave him an opportunity to reevalu-
ate the signiﬁcance of identity within his
own work. Although Penny’s work, com—

 

‘posed of several studio portraits of fellow
students, Was-produced last fall, presente
ing his work for the ﬁrst time has given
him an opportunity to see the transfor»
mation of the identity of his subjects over

time. “It was interesting to look back on
my work, and to see how its signiﬁcance,
and the people, had changed since then,"
Penny said. .

Student~artists such as Underwood
hope that the student appropriations of

Faulconer's theme will draw campus
and community-wide attention to the
school’s artistic resources. By incorporat-
ing student work into the school’s artistic
showcases, they hope to make students
feel more involved and invested in the

largerworkings of the Faulconer Gallery.
In addition to bringing student work into
the exhibition, the gallery has developed
a ‘Facehook rampage, as well as a Plan
under the handle [gallery]. “We're really
trying to build a social media presence for

Faulconer,” Underwood said. “The Smith
exhibit isjust one of the ways we’re trying
to accomplish that goal."

Those ‘Darlins not to be taken lightly

Opposing last week’s three man band, Russian Circles, Those Darlins features three, equally tough, southern ladies

BY CAROLIN SclloLz

This Saturday, country is coming to Grinnell and it is
bringing some punk.

Those Darlins, orMurrreesboro,Tenn. will play in Grin—
nells Gardener Lounge at 9 p. m

The band, made up orKeuey Darlin the groups bassist,
Jessi Darlin, who plays the guitar, and Nikki Darlin, barie
tone ukulele playerino they are not related—went live for
the first time in 2006. Since then, numerous live gigs have
followed known to be both entertaining and, sometimes, a
little bit booze-fueledTheir 2010 tour leads them not only
out of the South and to Grinnell, but also to way up north

with [enn Mavin

to places such as Providence, Rhode Island and Montreal,
Chicbec.

Perhaps the most unusual thing about the band is that
each member writes and sings. This unusual spread may
explain why their music cannot be clearly deﬁned. Darlins
are sometimes refel'red to as a pop hand, even though their
music cannot be limited to this or any other genre. More
than country or pop alone, their style can be described as
somewhere in betweeniwith a little bit ofpunk.

The music may sound a little like country to the angry,
but their lyrics are much tougher and their concerts. more
often than not, rowdier than a country,‘genre might give

them credit for. Even so, there’s a risk ofrepetitiveness here,
as some of the songs sound strikingly like the one before.

The chief success of their small Nashville label, Oh Wow
Dang, Those Darlins will deﬁnitely get people to move to
their music, since the hands lyrics are generally hilarious.
The trio sings about feminism, strong Women in their lives,
rural life and poverty but also about equally important top-
ics. such as eating the "whole damn thing” of chicken.

actly their music sounds like the ﬁrst single “Wild One” is
