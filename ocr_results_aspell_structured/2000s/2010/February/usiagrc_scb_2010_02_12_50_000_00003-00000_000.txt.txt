Leon Boisiein, President ofBat-d College and
Lean Levy Professor m the Arts andHumanities, paid
a visit to the College Tlmrsdm/ to speak a/hts thaughts
on the relationship between education and democracy,
Bots/em is the author of the book ”Jejfcrsanir Children:
Education and the Promise of American Culture " and is art
internatianally recognized conductor He has also served
as the music director for both the American and Jerusalem
Symphony Orchestras. Boistein is a strong supporter of
educational reform including educating prisoners and
completely altering the current American high school
system. Max Gutenberg/mm the S&B sat down with him
for a few questions.

Can you summarize your views of endowments in the
college education system currently in the' United States?

The purpose of an institution is not to commit to an
endowment. An endowment should enable an institution
to do the things it needs to do and 1m suggesting that a
time has Come for institution to broaden their agenda of
what they deﬁne as their mission. The management of
institutions with endowments is probably too conservative
in terms of their deﬁnition of mission. They are not in

the business of scholarship and research, the educational
mission needs to be broadened in ways that are appropriate
to each institution, there is no universal answer.

What do you think the majority ota college’s
endowment should go towards? '

Endowments are needed to support everything a college
does—its public missions, scholarships: faculty salaries,
buildingsﬁall kind of things, Endowments are there to

enable the institution. But there has been a tendency to
stress and define quality to by the size and growth of the
endowment alone I think we’ve over done it.

Considering that you’ve been the president of Bard for
35 years, what changes have you seen in liberal arts
community during that time period?

The deﬁnition ofliberal arts, principally, has not changed.
The delivery ofthe liberal arts has always [had] to adjust
to the political and social realities that every generation
faces, The ones we face now happen to include the place
of America economically in the world, the question of
future of the American educational system, the role of
science in the conduct of the modern world and the thresh
for democracy. So those are issues that deﬁne our agenda,
the instruments we use for that agenda, which are the
disciplines ofleamingiall have a place, hem the Classics
to Physics.

Do you think that all Liberal Arts Colleges should run
at least one high school?

Yes, I believe every institution should take responsibility
for one or more public high schools. And use online
capacity to train teachers who are in our disciplines. So
people who teach Math, Physics, Biology should have

a regular relationship with high school teachers in those
subjects.

You are also a strong advocate for educating inmates,
however is that not possibly a waste of resources,
because any joh that an inmate may become qualiﬁed
for by getting a Bachelors degree would not hire that

person because of his of her criminal record?

There’s no doubt there will be prejudice against you but
that‘s the case no matter what happensAso is that prison
better educated if they have a BA from Grinnell 'or Bard?
Yes. We need to ﬁght that prejudice {or someone who has
gotten a BA and has a criminal record. . .And are there
criteria to determine who deserves that second chance?
Does a person who studied and earned a degree of a high
quality while incarcerated not belong at the head of the
line for a second chance? And, ifthere is nobody willing
to give them a second chance what does that tell us about
our society? Then we should have an incarceration system
where once you get convicted, just shoot them, because
they‘ll have no life.

How do you think President Obnma has done in terms
of dealing with education?

I think Obama is the best hope the country has had in
decades. I hope and pray that he succeeds, that the midterm
elections aren't too catastrophic for the Democrats

and that he is reelected. I understand this necessity to
thread a middle course and I think all that is trying to

be done in education is good. I would hope that more

can be done, more in support of university system, state
university system, and reinvestment of federal investment
in universities. I hope that reform of the system goes to
things like early college and other initiatives that are not
completely tied the charter school movement. I think there
will be resources for those things. Finally, I hope that there
is a real thought given to investing in teacher recruitment
and teacher training—both in service and pro-service
training.

The eight week stretch of constant stress
ors such as classes, summer applications
and stormy winter weather before spring
Break can overwhelm the most level-headed
Grinnellians. The Second Annual Wellness
Fair nicely interrupted the
winter blues this pastTuesday,
Feb. 9 on the ﬁrst and second
ﬂoors of the Joe Rosenﬁeld
'25 Center.

The fair continued the
tradition of promoting a
healthier student body while
including more student orga-
nizations than last year, according to Wellness
Coordinator Jen Jacobson '95 who planned the
event.

“February tends to be that bleak month in
that stretch before spring Break...the days are
still dark and cold and snowy,” jacobsen said.
“So we ﬁgure it‘s a good opportunity to lighten
up a bit."

Like last year, stations informed on topics
from blood pressure to nutrition to exercise,
while the number of student groups present
also grew, due to Jacobsen’s effort to make
wellness peer-educational.

“Everything I’ve researched, everything 1
know, everything I've heard from our students
on campus is a real big belief-in peerzeducaz

...having the dogs here is re-
ally (do! It’s really relaxing, a
nite break from academic.”

tion, especially in areas of wellness,"]acobsen
said. “We wanted to increase the amount of
student involvement, especially because well»
ncss can be peer activity too,"

Students roamed the unusually packed
JRC and generally enjoyed what the fair of-
fered, said Punita Sahu ’12.

"It’s a really positive
thing,” she said. “Like after
the holidays people feel kind
of sad. It’s the longest pe-
riod of time most people are
at Grinnell, it's a nice break
from academics."

East Campus RLC Dan
Hirsch,joined by several varsity male athletes,
headed a table pmmcrlng “Real Men," a newly
formed organization concerned with ﬁnding a
new way to project masculinity

“We are a new student group working to
create a positive deﬁnition of masculinity by
doing a few ditterent things." Hirsch said. “We
are committed to eliminating discriminatory
speech and sexual assaults.”

Real Men will continue Its efforts beyond
the Wellness Fair, with events planned for next

car.

y “In the (all we are going to be kicking off
the year with a workshop for all incoming
ﬁrstryear male athletes, just to try and give
them that extra step other than N50 to let

Kali Nelson ’13

rhem know what goes on a college campus
and be more ofa peer mentor than anything”
member Ryan Creps ’12 said.

International Student Organization
(ISO) and Ofﬁce of International Strident
Affairs (OISA) member Shivani Santoki ’11,
who ran the tea booth both this year and last
year was excited to share a bit of her culture
and at the same time help take some of the
weight on her peers.

_ First year Karl Nelson'13 round a missing
piece of home life while at Grinnell, with the
rank popular therapy dogs.

“1 really miss my dogs, so having the dogs
here is really cool." Nelson said. “It's really re—
laxing, a nice break from academics."

Due to student demand, the {air may be
expanded to a twice event a year in the future,
according to jacobsen.

“Students have requested doing it twice a
year, maybe we would do a sort of different
version ofit,”_iacobsen said. “Certainly if stu-
dents are saying, 'we want more wellness'we
Want to provide them with more wellness."

Jacobsen mms to see wellness pushed be-
yond one night a year to a student position in
every cluster.Thc wdlness coordinator would
function like a hall social coordinator, but
throw informative healthy events and com-
municare with Jacobsen regularly.
