“Camo Condoms: you won't see it coming."

I“! CARLOS Re Lu

For Harry Horn of Middleton, WI, what began as a
metaphorical tagline for safe sex to sell on T-shirts became
a business plan with a speciﬁc mission to help revel-It the
spread of sexually transmitted infections (S’IPIs) among
young teens

Originally, Mr. Horn, father of Lauren Horn '12, and
his business associate David Schield thought that this pun
was funny enough to be put on a
T‘Shh‘l, so they began puts
ting together a marketing
campaign to sell the idea.

However, their business
model and overall objective for
the campaign changed shortly
thereafter when they saw an ar-
ticle in their local newspaper in Mid-
dletown, about the increasing rate of STIs
among adolescents. Being that they are both parents
of teenagers, the article convinced them to change not only
their business model, but the whole meaning of the allit-
erative phrase as well.

“Came has taken on a whole new meaning for our
campaign. Now it is 'Camo Condoms: they‘ll never see it
coming!‘ referring to the prevention of the STI,"wrote Mr.

Horn in an email message.

The mission statement for the campaign reads: “To fur—
iher social awareness in the prevention of sexually trans-
mitted infections (STI’s) and unwanted pregnancy, and
change sexual behavior using a unique marketing, advertiSr
ing, and merchandising campaign.n

One of their unique strategies is a fun website: ca-
mocondoms.org. Here, visitors can ﬁnd games, car-
toons, FAQ, links to resources and where to ﬁnd
help, and useful general information on STls. Mr.

them says there is also potential for a blog to go

along with the site, and has plans to include
an online store to sell condoms and other
Came Condoms (CC) Brand
merchandise. Merging his
original business model
with his current one, Mr.
Horn says that the T-
shirts and other CC
Brand merchan-
will have “humor
ous and ﬂippant yet pointed «
phras~ es, about the use of
condoms to promote the safer sex mes»
sage."

Mr Horn will also take Camo Condoms to college
campuses, where he plans to distribute complimentary
c o n - doms to a few campus social organizations, such

fraternities and sororities.

Also part of the campaign is the catch
phrase "CAMO UP!" which is to provide
the same connotation as the phrase “wear
a condom," Mr. Horn plans to ﬁlm a com-

mercial with arr-army of Grinneu College
students chanting this catch phrase at future

Grinnell Athletic event.
“The commercial idea was hatched when
my wife and I were at the Midwest Conference
, Soccer Tournament at Loras College. A group of
Grinnell students did the condom cheer and I was so
impressed that I asked my daughter ifshe could ﬁlm it
to put on YouTube. We are also thinking we would like
to have a contest on YouTube to develop a commercial for

our products and campaign." said Mr. Horn.
