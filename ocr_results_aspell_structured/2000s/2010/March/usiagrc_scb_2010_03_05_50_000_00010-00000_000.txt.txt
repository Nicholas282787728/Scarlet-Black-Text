Who the hell is “Harris” anyway? All-campus magic, livin’ the dream

“Dear Diary..."

In just one week’s time, we will ﬁnd ourselves closing in on
arguably one of the more raucous spectacles to have ever graced
the stage of our beloved Harris Center. Yeah, you've seen those
fufiballers workin’hard outside the D-Hall so as to make sure
that the ‘pre', ‘inms‘, and ‘post' sparties of this year's Disco
are intensely dream-livable. Admittedly, while a fan of all the
moustaches and brut cologne that this night brings, my purest
Harris allegiances lie elsewhere. As it is frequently obvious, my
dedication to keeping the dreams of Kenny Loggins or Stan
Bush alive is made manifest not just in my un-ironic t-shirt
collection or purposefully Belist pop singer references, but also
in my two year protosfascist monopoly over Bob Harris (shout
out to [burroWSll, one level). But Alas! I come here to you all
not to debate over whit}; Harris party is most outrageous, at
least not necessarily. Instead, I would like to look at what is it
exactly that continually draws us into or deters us away from
that magical world way up north. What is it, ifanything, that
brings us back time and again to 1118 10"- Avenue in order to
“live the dream"?

Are you thinking "yeah well maybe I went to the Harv
ris a lot first semester, but now I'm like way too cool to go"?
Well, you're wrong. Because none of us are. Even pretentious
self-absorbed offscampus seniors like me still ﬁnd the time to
get our hands stamped, tuck away our winter coats and slither
through a sea ofbodies to wait in line for a 50/50 shot at cheap
beer or lukemtm tap mter. It’s just a matter of circumstance
that draws each ofus in for our respective reasons. Some teams
and orynizations have their particular traditions or favorites
(like ISO Rave or SoccerBall) while others are drawn out of
alliance with the particular people throwing the shindig (think
of dorm clusters JaMaLand or LooseHead). Hell, some people
might even fancy the gumption of those who take the risk to
throw a new party theme in hopes of generating a longstanding
classic or just a momentary romp. Did 1 think the “Billy Mays
Memorial"was a little too soon to be tongue and cheek? Sure.

But I'll be damned if] don't support their right to throw a DJ
extramganaa in the name of that modern day learns any day

What is it exactly then about sweaty strangers clad in cos-
mmes with that five mile stare, pounding Madonna jams and
those intimidating “SECURITY" personnel that keeps us
coming back for more? (i/k, you know I love you [moorecou]
and ACE for all your hard workl) Lets take Mary B James for
example. Oh, how 1 long to don exquisite fake eyelashes and
the whole nine yards or drag gear afrer being deprived ofthis
spectacle while abroad last spring. Is it then just the opportus
nity to get dressed up around a
particularly fascinating theme
that keeps Harris on my radar?
It’thut‘s the case, then it's only
important for me to make an
appearance at a dorm lounge
ﬁre hazard long enough for
people to take a couple dozen
Facebook photos. “Harris is
too dark for your iPhone anyway." No, no. I’m looking for the
real nitty gritty of those weekly funsfests that gets us commit-
ted to a good wrist level ink stain and those one-arm supported
forward urinal leans (ifyou’ve ever stood/squatted to pee, you'll
know what I'm talking about).

Is it the beer then? Well, probably. But it's my understand-
ing there's usually at least one or two parties with liberal serving
practices and a plethora of Natty Light going on at one time,
so lets keep trying. Is it the fact that its so accessible even if
you’re not friends with the other party goers, that you can re
main anonymous in a crowd, that its dark, that its loud, or that
it’s a place to go "just to dance"? Maybe it's the excitement built
up by Grinnell cultural heritage that Harris is the place to go in
order to solicit a hookup with that curie who ohrsoaserendipb
tously shares your workout schedule. However, at this point, it’s
politically important for me to recognize that I can only speak
for my own experiences and that my voice is one ota predomi-

DREAM

nantly white, straight, able-bodied and middle class collegiate
atmosphere. But lots of people cross through the doors of that
neon glass tower, not just Joanie and Chachie from Wisconsin.
So what the hell is it then? Because it’s not like there isn‘t
anything else to do at White House, the Slum, or wherever
else you started your night, right? You could probably even just
go to bed and get an early start on that response paper in the
morning, or at least try to make it to brunch before its over.
It seems as though my inquiry has not churned out the
kind of analytic results that we may have been hoping for. But
hold your horses there tiger,
and lets interrogate what a
loaded search this was in the
first place. How could we ex-
pected to get a clean, simple
and straight answer about
‘why’ we go to Harris when
it seems like even after only a
few lengthy paragraphs we’ve
already uncovered so many different and disparate pleasures
for the experiencing. Not to get aboard some ofthe hackneycd
‘Self Help Book’ jargon about saying ‘yes’ to life experiences,
but it seems like there is at least the potential for a Harris party
to be a place with a little something for everybody. Obviously
it would be dangerously uropian for me to suggest that this is
already the case, but I’m not afraid to be hopeful for the future.
So over the remaining weeks of the semester that I'm ﬁnding
fleetingly few, lets try to celebrate all there is to enjoy about
bumpin‘ and grindin' at our good ol’ partyin' hole. And whats
more, let’s try to figure out what work there is to be done to
open up Harris as a communal space with even more room for
divergent groups interests and cosmopolitan campus identities,
all the while remaining a site for multiple and diverse plea-
sures. Maybe then we'll be ‘living the dream.”
Not satisﬁed? Deal with it.
