Senator runs into
housing troubles

BY MAX CALENBERG

After representing Jamaland—or James, Cleveland and
Main Halls—for a semester, Chris Dorman ’12 came back
from Winter Break to ﬁnd himselfwithout a roommate, and
a few weeks later with his senatorship in jeopardy.

Dorman moved to Cowles after Dorman learned over
Winter Break his roommate would not be returning for the
spring 2010 semester.

“Hou 'ng talked to me about a week into school,” Dor-
man said They gave me the list of different roommates that
I would potentially have to be consolidated With at some
point in time,"

Eventually, Dorman found a possible opening in a cowles
quad though he planned to run as aJamaland senator consid»
ering he had already served one term in that position and his
living situation was not ﬁnalized. Dorman won his senatorial
race as aJoint Board representative.

“During the week of elections, I [found] out from HouSs
ing that they were going to send me over to Cowles," Dorman
said, “They gave me a key, so I started moving my stuffover,
at which point I was pulled in to talk to by a couple members
of SGA.”

SGA President Harry Krejsa '10 and Administrative Co-
ordinator Ethan Stiuby‘lO told Dorman he could not remain
a senator for jainaland ifhe moved to Cowles Hall.

“He would have either had to step down or I guess. bars
ring that, we could have impeached him, butrr.tliiit wouldn't
have made any sense,"Struby said.“The constitution says you
have be livmg [in the cluster you represent], so he would have
stepped down and we would have held a new election."

Dorman responded by going to housing in order to ex
plain his predicament and explore his options. Before the
elections, housing had insisted that he consolidate with ans
other student, however afterwards, Dorman was informed
that he would lose his Senate seat ifhe moved from the Ja-
inaland cluster.

“I could tell when I visited with Chris, that that was
something he was really passionate about, was being a sena-
tor," said Laura Gogg, Technical Assistant for Student Af-
fairs. ”My goal was then to say, ‘How can we make this work
so he can remain a senator, free up a room for us and ofcourse
stay somewhere else he would be comfortable with insidejas
maland?”

The result was a compromise that eliminated the conﬂict
for all involved.

“After some negotiations between housing, SGA and my-
self, we were able to secure [a location] where there happened
to be a girl moving out across the hall from me where 1 would
end up just taking her room,"Dorman said.

Dorman’s senate position enabled him to avoid consolida-
tion, a policy that requires all firsts and second-year students
to have a roommate. Dorman doesn't believe this rule is nec—
essary for one who has been at the College for more than year.

“i would like to better understand why consolidation hapz

ens," Dorman said. “In part, as maybe a first year 1 see why
housing] want[s] you to have a roommate. It’s hard for me
to believe that a secondzyear second-semester student really
needs to have a roommate,"

The policy, according to Gogg, is less about a student sup—
port system. Rather, it is concerned with the fact that there
are half—full rooms on campus and the consolidation policy
helps open extra space that may be needed in unexpected cir-
cumstanees.

"The consolidation process exists because we need to
have vacant room. For instance, last fall [rooms] were full,"
Gogg said. “As we had outbreaks of the ﬂu...there is isolas
tion needed...or [perhaps] two roommates have a fight, blow
up and need to be separated. So you can imagine there are
many reasons why we need to have vacant rooms on campus
for emergency housing reasons.”

Dorman does not want to just move away from this or
deal, but instead use his senatc position to make sure some
thing like this doesn’t happen again.

“I’d like t change the policy," Dorman saidr “Ifiiot, at
least start to address it so people can starting talking about it,
and why we do rt,"

Bias-motivated incidents reoccur

Some SGA candidates posters vandalized with racial slurs

BY SOLOMON MILLER

The largest sign outside the dining hall in the JRC reads
“We belong here."

Students wrote this message
in response to a public attack
on the Latino/a community at
Grinnell. Campaign signs for
Graciela Guzman ’11, a Latina
candidate for SGA Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs (VPSA),
were covered over by hate speech,
including the racial slur “wet—
back, go back.”

Guzman discovered the den
faced signs on Friday night, ac-
cording to various first-hand
sources. She and her friends re-
ported the incident to security as
a potential hate crime. They met
with Michael Hunt, the RLC on duty, and John Booth of
Security to decide what course of action to take,

Guzman wants to emphasize that she is not the only
target ofthe hate speech.

“That it happened to me is just coincidence," Guzman
said. "Had it not been on a poster, it would have been said,
it would have been written somewhere else, it would have
been a matter oftime.”

“It's a wake up call," Hunt said, “Sometimes we can get
comfortable, especially here at Grinnell... forgetting there
are people who have a hard time because this doesn’t feel
like a community for them,"

Lizeth Gutierrez ’12 was with Guzman soon after she
discovered the bare speech, Her ﬁrst reaction was to reel
rejected.

“So you don’t want me here) You don't want me, my
ideas, what 1 represent in this campus?" Gutierrez saidr

Guiteriez encouraged Guzman to tell her story, and to
help the campus move forward.

“I’m going to let you cry today, but tomorrow you can’t
cry, because we're not weak," Guiterriez said she told Gra-
ciela the day after the vandalism was found. “We’re going
to show these people who believe we don’t belong
here how much we are a part of this campus."

Hunt, Booth and other relevant administra-
tors worked with Guzman to determine how she
wanted them to respond, as described byThe Hate
Crime/Bias-Motivated Incident Response Proto—
col put in place earlier this yearr ,

Some campaign posters of other candidates
were found defaced, but without the same racist
connotations.They were not determined bias»mo-
tivated incidents, and as such were not considered
in the same terms.

Guzman worked with Elena Bernal '94, Vice
President of Diversity and Achievement, to draft
the all-campus email sent out Tuesday Morning.
The e-mail stated that posters ofa VPSA candi-
date had been vandalized with anti-Latina slurs and that the
act was ofﬁcially recognized as a bias—motivated incident.
It has not yet gone through the legal procedures that would
identify it as a hate crime, according to Bernal,

There will be an open forum for members ofthe Grinnell

community to come together and share their feelings and

reactions to the incident next Thursday, March 11, at 4:15 in
JRC 101. Guzman thinks this is only the beginning ofwhat
needs to be done.

“In order to really see any marked change on this campus,
there needs to be dialogue across organizations that tradi—
tionally don't have this dialogue," she said.

Guzman identified classrooms as a place where minor-
ity students often feel uncomfortable because of unspoken
biases and a lack ofopen conversation,

“There’s majors that I've chosen not to take, courses that
I've elected not to take in a semester because it’s risky. You
don't feel safe. You don’t feel comfortable," she said.
