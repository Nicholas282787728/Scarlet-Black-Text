' Dancers sighted all over campus

liv KATl lRlNE CHUNG

From Thursday to Tuesday, a group of dancers moved across
campus, surprising, pleasing. and connising both passersrby and in-
tenﬁoml obsewers,'lhe ﬂuid execution of the dancers’ modem cho-
reography, coupled wish she unconventional venues—they perronned
prerry rnuch anywhere on campus—drauenged prevailing ideas about
she nature ota dance performance.

The Grinnell College Dance Troupe, a danee company with
seven student dancers, focused on shis challenge in their semes;
ter-long project “Sightings.”As a weeklong series or short dances,
“Sightings" was comprised of shree diirerent pieces, “Transparens
Dwellings," “Seeing Through Walls," and "We Waised All Winter"
that took place in various locarions around die College campus.

Shawn Woinncle Theasse, explained that as a sitesspeclﬁc projr
ecr, “Sightings" took dance our of eraditional stage settings and put
it inro familiar placesThe dances were dioreogmphed speciﬁcally
for she selecred spaces in an eirors to explore androesamine the
campus tluough dance.

“I think inssiuisionnlly, sometimes, dance is perceived [as] com-
parnncnsalized."Wornacis sardrls's underssood so do certain things
in pnrtlcular ways. l3y raising is on she surge and into our everyday
world we begin so see mmy more possibilities ofwhat dance and
choreography can do."

The iirss performance, “Transparent Dwellings."choreographed
by Kathleen Hurley, Leenuer in Theatre, was a mobile piece dsas
begun in the Bucksbnum Center for the Arts rind ended inside the
Joe Rosenﬁeld '25 Center (JRC), Dancers ran boda forwards and
backwards, leaps in she air, slammed doors, and more as spectators
nailed behind to waseh she perronnance.

"We were reallyjust trying to pay attention to the different eler
menss of archiseetuse and play or? of those in a way that makes a
dance," said Eleanor Nelson ’10, a member ofthe Troupe,

Another piece, “Seeing Through Walls," choreographed by
womaclcwas a meditative piece shat soolt place in she elbow of die
Noyce Science Censor. The elbows glass windows and crisscross-
ing white beams created an inseressing visual eEectfor die audience,
who watched she piece from rhe courtyard, rhe hallway, and wious
windows. Choreographically, the work consisted ofdancers in white
jumpsuit: who slithered, balanced, and knelt on the windows’ metal
bums.

“1 was surprised to see people dancing in she windows, Lhm I
saw shas they were actually coordinated in sheir movemeno," said
Joe Sinnwell '12, who caught she performance while studying in the
elbow “I liked she location—it's an intesessing spot to do a danoe
performance. I’ve always wanted to do that, like climb all over those
windows."

Nelson orplainrd that part ofthe goal of the piece was so work
with and then change the area that the students danced in.

We spent a lot oftirne exploring she space,” Nelson said. ‘We
concentrated on movemenls that made ourselves feel at home in the
space and siren movements shar agitasod the space."

DanoeTroupe performed their last piece, “WeWaited All Wiri—
ter," choreographed by Sandra Marhern-smith, Associate Professor
ofDancc at Denison University, on the south side ofthe IRCJ‘his
ﬁnal piece was accompanied by a video compilation of the Dance
Troupe's rehearsals, edited by Daniel Agosdno '13.The ﬁlm compo
nent was projected on white screens stretched across the open spaces
behind the live dancerss

”VVe’re dancing wish ourselves in away," Nelson said.

Meanwhile, students, faculty, and stalf gathered around to vlmtdi,
mesmerized by the dancers curious movements.

“We didn’twant the video to completely capture the attention of
rhe audience,”Agosdno said,’“[ med so play wish a lot ofcolors and
played with timer had so thinkofthe video as shis negasive space
behind the dancers."

Because she video component included clips from she pieces
in "Sightings,” she ﬁnal performance had the eirect of bringing to-
gether all of doe dances in the series into one cohesive show. The
combination also reﬂected the ﬁinction of theJRC as a central locus
iion on campus.

The week’s performances signaled the end or she sire-speciﬁc
project for Dance Troupe, shough she dancers have been perform-
ing, m away, throughous she entire selnestet.Thc sroupe pracriced in
public spaces during rehearsals, suds as she J'RC, Alumni Recimtion
Hall, and Noyce, in order to explore she buildings' architecture and
campus spaces, as well as to prepare for the ﬁnal work

“[Site-speciﬁc dance] blurs a number of lines," Womack said,
"It blurs the line between performance and rehearsal, ‘lt blurs the
line between performer and viewer, everyday activities and sheasrical
acdvides,when they brush up against each oshcr in shat way. It chal-
lenges a lot ofboundancsc"
