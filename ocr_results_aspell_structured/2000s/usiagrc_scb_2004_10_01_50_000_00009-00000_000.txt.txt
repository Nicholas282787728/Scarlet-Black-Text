Toast the bread. Spread the tuna salad evenly over one piece and cover with
the cheese. Setting aside the other slice of bread and the garnishes, place this
assembly on a plate and warm it in the microwave for 20 seconds. Then, add the
tomato, lettuce, and second slice of bread, but take the time to peruse the salad
and sandwich bars for other garnishes, too. 782:7 King
