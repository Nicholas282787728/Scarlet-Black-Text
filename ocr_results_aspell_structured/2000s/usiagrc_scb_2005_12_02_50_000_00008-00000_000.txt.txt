The sleek dog, arched gracefully,
moves switdy over rhe winding con
crete, closing in on its final destination.
Scattered across the United States,
these hounds transport college students
seeking to avoid cosrly plane and rrain
tickets on their journey home for the
long winter.

A Greyhound trip costs $154 to
go from Des Moines to Washington,
DC, cheaper rhan
paying $200 or more
for plane tickets.

Greyhound also
proves that the the
early bird catches
the worm. Those
who buy a ticket at
least seven days in
advance can save at
least $100 on their trip.

Greyhounds inexpensive cost may
come at the price of comfort. EbonyJa-
cobs '09 rook a Greyhound home with
two friends for fall break and has less
than pleasant memories.

“Greyhound sucksl"she said. Know-
ing that the bus ride would take about
25 hours from Des Moines ro Marys
land, Jacobs hoped the ride would “nice
and comfy.” Instead, broken sears, scary
drivers, unclean bathrooms and unex-
pected police intervention awaited her.
Recalling her physial discomfort, she
said, “The seat literally came off The
bathrooms were nasty I had to bale
ance because I didn’t want to touch the
beams," saidJacobs, as she attempted to
demonstrate the gravity defying squats

”The seal literal/y (me off. The
bathroom: were nasty / had to
Ila/ante berause / didn’t want to
touch the beams,” ,
Ebony Jacobs ’09

an ‘ }.

she had performed in the bus bath»
room.

The bus ride home was also un»
pleasant for Jacobs because of the free
quent stops the bus made on its jourr
ney. “They kept stopping every two
hours.Just to get to Chicago took eight
hours,” she said. “They also made us
transfer three or four times and at odd
hours like three in the morning!"

Jacobs said she was finished with
Greyhound. “I
wouldn‘t do it again
unless I had to.” She
said she would ﬂy
home from now on.

Students' fellow
Greyhound rravele
1ch often make up
just as much of the
experience as the
bus itself.

Jacobs described several people as
"weird One lady was sleeping in
the aisle," she said. “Another let out the
loudest fart."

Salman Abbassi ’09 accompanied
Jacobs on the trip and said “To be
safe, traveling with a trusted friend is
a must." She said triends help pass rhe
time, and can protect students from unr
wanred neighbors. “1r was really had,"
Abbassi slud. “watch out for any huge
and stinky people who don’t mind their
business and love poking in yours,"

According to Alexis Castro ’09,
who took a Greyhound earlier in the
year, “Sometimes it‘s crappy because
you could be sitting next to a crying

baby and mother and you want to sleep
and you are on there for hours."

srudenrs have found that bringing
food can also make the trip easier to
stomach. Although Greyhound does
have food stops, Jacobs said preparing
for possible waits is a wise decision.

“We were starving we were do
layed because of an arrest so we didn’t
have any food breaks," she said. “But,
the stupid thing was that they had
smoke breaks like in the woods and
srurr places where we couldn't get
food!"

Others have found their Grey-
hound experience more worthwhile,
Last summer, Joseph Gryka ’06 and
John Bohman ’06 received a grant from
Grinnell to travel across the country on
a Greyhound bus in order to interview
alumni. Bohman, president of SGA.
wanted to gather alumni opinion on is
sues for the coming year.

“Greyhound was my home," Gryka
said. “Something about the experience
I always kind of liked it, and after
wards I grew to love it!"

Gryka said his fellowpassengers also
improved the trip. “You meet people
you would never mm at Grinnell and
see part of the country that you would
never see," he said. “You don't meet ex-
cons on a daily basis in Grinnell and I
did every day on the bus."

Casrro also praised Greyhound, de
spite her seat next to a cry baby. “The
Greyhound is inexpensive and you can
meet a lot of different people," she said.
“You see a lot of America. It’s a good
experience."
