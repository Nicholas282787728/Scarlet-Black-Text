More students approved

for off-camp

BY PETER HENRY

Many seniors anxiously look forward to
cooking, cleaning and rent as marks of adulrr
hood and hope to live ofrrcanrpus in their last
Grinnell yearIUsuﬂll)’.some
seniors have these hopes
unfulﬁlled by being denied
approval to live off camr
pus. But over the last two
years, administrators have
allowed more students to
live otr campus, hoping
that those seniors left on
campus will be more satiSr
fled and that lessrcrowded dorms will provide
greater notability in moving students, shorrld
the need arise.

According to college administrators, in
prevrous years the college initially approved be:
tween 140 and 150 students to live off campus.
So far this year, college administrators have exr
tended 162 offrcampus approval otters and cxr
peet the number to eventually climb over 200.
Last year, the college eventually allowed 205
students to live off campus.

One change administrators hope this will
make is to resolve the waitlist before room draw.
1n previorrs years, according to student Affairs
Technical Assistant Laura Gogg, surdenrs have
been taken off the waitllst after room draw,
which created more work for Student Affairs
and ended up giving “very good rooms in very
good areas ntrhe campus" to younger students
with higher room drarv numbers.

Seniors choose rooms before all undeiclass-
men regardless of their room draw numbers. But

us housing

ifa senior is granted approval from the wairlist

after room draw, their dorm room is then free

to anyone. By granting moie initial approvals,

administrators hope to lessen the impact of the
wairlist on the room draw
process.

Strident Affairs also
hopes that this year's in»
crease in initial off-campus
offers would both simplify
the room draw process and
allow upperelassmen who
choose to stay on campus

_ to have a better selection
of rooms.

“It wasn't really reﬂective of how the room
draw process should work,” said Gogg. “We
were wanting to give students who had that
good room draw number and were still wanting
to live on campus more oran option to get (host:
better rooms.” To facilitate the move of more
students off campus, Student Affairs posted the
approval signup sheet earlier and for a longer
period than previously.

Dean of Student Life Jennifer Krohn said
that allowing more students to live off canr
pus would cause fewer problems in thc future
when students have to change rooms because
for medical or personal reasons. “We an: full
at 1300 [students]," said Krohu “\Vhen we are
full, we don't have the ﬂexibility to move people
around,"

Ki'ohn said that while Grinncll is an “int
rcntionally residential" college, the accommtr

Aftcr a summer ﬁlll ofrhe usual movie set
quels, Grinrrell students will return to campus
next (all just in time for another familiar rcrun'
Danny Carroll versus Eric Palmer in Grirr
nell’s House District 75

The thrrd act's twist to keep things inter
esung? This time. Carroll, a Republican who
filled the seat for
twelve years, will be
the challenger and
not the incumbent.

After narrowly
fending off Palmer
(DrOskaloosd) in
2004, Carroll was
unscared in 2006 in
an election featuring,
among other things,
very high turnout
by Grinnel] College
students, who largely supported Palmer,
