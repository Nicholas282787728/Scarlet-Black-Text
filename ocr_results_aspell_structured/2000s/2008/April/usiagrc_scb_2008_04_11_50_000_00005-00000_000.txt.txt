I Am Legend
(2 007),

Philosophical thriller devolves

into generic action flick

isolation has always been a big draw in
movies, be it on a deserted island like in Cm!
Away or in a haunted hotel like in Tie sawing,
Whar [Am Lrgrnd examines is what happens
when this isolation is manmade and urban.

The movie chronicles the adventures of
the apparent last man on Earth, military man
Robert Neville (Will Smith) as he fights to
survive in an overgrown New York City while
attempting to find a cure for a man-made vi-
rus he is naturally immune to. Neville also has
to contend with those humans who have mu-
tated from the virus, becoming nocturnal feral
creatures. The routine of his Search for a cure
keeps him sane, as does his practice ofassigna
ing identities to mannequins he has scattered
throughout the city.

As essentially the only actor throughout
the movie, Smith has a lot of weight to carry,
but he pulls it off admirably and effortlessly
His charisma is such that he is able to share it
with his fairhful dog 5am, in what is basically
the largest role for a German Shepard since
the old Rin Tin Tin movies. Sam and Smith
make for a great pair, which really helps keep
the movie from growing stale.

The special effects can be hit and miss.
While there are some great sequences ofNev-
ille cruising through a deserted Manhattan,
other times this dystopian future leads to some
rarhcr crummy-looking C01,

The first two thirds of the movie are the
strongest. Just rhe simple watching of smith,

Burling exhibit balances

At first, the images in Tl}: Rulsi‘ari End-
ing seem shocking and violent: volcanic crup-
tions and dark clouds of pollution mingle with
photographs of funerals and bombadamaged
homes.

Upon further exploration, however, the im—
ages prove to be more than just simple state
ments of tragedy; they take on a complex,
ironic tone that engages and challenges the
viewer,

TIM Rurmm Emlbi , currently on display
in Burling basement’s grim 8thawing Study
Room, is Tacita Dean’s exhibit. According to
the information included in the show, Dean's
project is composed of “digitally manipulated
photogravures of blackaandawhite photOt
graphic postcards from rhe years around World
war 1.” The images are grainy, often perplext
ing and uniformly haunting,

Dean, who studied at Falmoutli School of
Art and the Slade School of Fine Art in Lona
don. is known primarily for her work in film.
Conscquendgitis no surprise that this exhibit
explores the links between film and image.

The title of the exhibit comes from the
practice in rhe carly ﬁlm industry in Denmark
where, before exporting films to the us. and
Russia, different endings were added to films

tragic for Russia, Dean's exhibit, rhcn, imag-
ines creating the tragic Russian endings that
were added to these films.

In 77;: Rurri'an Ending, Dean adds “stage
directions" and comments to each tragic imp
age, some serious and some comical. Her no-
tations, written in white over the photographs
themselves, contribute a sense of distance and
humor to the images.

For example, in Die Explosion in Dem Kai
rm], Dean subtitles the image “The (Explosive)
Russian Ending" and writes “Bang!" over the
photographs flying dust and rubble.Tlie scene
shows an explosion that has sent debris ﬂying
straight up into the air, capturing the precise
momenr of the explosion. Dean's clever com—
menrs, however, mitigate the gravity of the
sit-nation, providing a counterweight ro rhe
ﬁnality, energy and shock of the image.When
these moments of tragedy are imagined as the
ending [0 a film, rarhcr man a real event, rhey
have less impact.

Another memorable piece was Tire Deni};
w Prim, subtitled “The (Very sad) Russian
Ending." The image depicts the funeral of a
dead priest, arrayed in his coffin in church.
Dean's comments on rhis piece include a la-

But the biggest dragging point for the
movie is the third act. For most of the movie,
rhe screenplay is surprisingly deep for an action
movie, and questions are brought up about the
mutated humans that aren't ever answered in
satisfactory manner.
