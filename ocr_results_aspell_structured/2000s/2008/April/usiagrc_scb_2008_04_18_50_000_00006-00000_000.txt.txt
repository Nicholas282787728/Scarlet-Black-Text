Hunt for new RLCs well under way

in Ka'rlr MCMULLl-ZN

As summer quickly approaches, seniors aren't the only ones
involved in the job hunt. The Ofﬁce orstndenr Arrairs has begun
yet another search for qualified individuals to ﬁll the position or
Resident Life Coordinator (RLC). Because of the impoitancc
ofthe liverin position, administrators rue conducting a thoaougll
candidate search for next year and, pelhaps more significantly
have added an additional RLC position to East campus.

“The [RLC] role is different here than at other schools where
the RLC is seen as more administrative and more as a policy
enforcement role,” said new Vice President of Student Affairs
Houston Dougharty. “Here we really value their roles as tome
munity builders, and counselors and folks who can really help
students in a ditreront way than is the tradition,

This year's search will attempt to all four
RLC positions. The college must replace one

filled comes from the recent addition of a me
turn RLC position in East Campus

"There was an agreement rhar once the student population
reached 1500, a seventh RLC would he added," said Associate
Dean and Director of Residence Life Sheree Andrews. "It was
one orthe recommendations our ota [mental health] review that,
as the student population increases, the Residential Life Coordi-
nator positions would increase."

The new RLC will be placed in East campus, taking over

The reaction to the shift among students has been generally
positivejeft’ Sinick ’09, who is one of the students intervicwmg
candidates for the positions, said the extra position would allow
each RLC to devote more time to their responsibilities. “1 think it
may turn out to be a really good idea because it Will help free up
some more time for some of the RLCs and allow them to focus
on not only their students and their student staff but some of
[their] other responsibilities," said Sinick

Andrews also said that now lddition would help address some
nfdifﬁculties specific to life in ist Campus dorms. “It’s hard to
build community in East campus," said Andrews, “and I'm thinks
ing that, [with another RLC] there will be more visibility ersttt
dent Attaits in East campus."

As part or the hiring process, Dougharry said that bccausc
orrhe positions importance to student life, the college hopes to
clarity the role or RLCs on campus. “1 really see [RLCs] as test-
dential educators,” he said. “And I think one of the things we need
to do bettci is to educate the campus, othei staﬂ’and faculty, about
what the role ofRLCs is."

The search committee, composed of Andrews, Bicnick,
Dougharty and Loosehead RLC Kim HindsrBrush, attended
two student affairs conferences in March, interviewing candidates

“We want to make sure [the candidates]
are a good at for Grinnellithat they love
students [and] that they want to be here,"
said Andrews. "And we want to see if they
like us too."

Though the standard contract for an RLC is only three years,
Hinds-Brush is returning to Gainnell tor a fourth, in part, accord-
ing to adininistratois, to avoid an even largei turnover of RLCs

“Because we knew we'd have as laige an exit as we've had this
you, with two [RLCs] leaving midyear, We asked Kim to stay,"
said Doughatry.

HindSanlsh said that her own motivations fol remaining on
campus were closely tied to the students she has worked with and
the staff _changes within Student Affairs.

“[1 vmnt] to see the class of 2009 graduate and to see what
changes Houston brings to the department," said Hinds-Brush.
“I’m very curious."

SA Room Draw

llv Pa'r CALDWELL

For many Grinnell students, room draw is marked by the
stressful experience of running around l-latris try-mg to ﬁnd
a room, Noimally, Student Staff room draw, held Tuesday
April 8, is a mellower affair as Student Advisors (SAs) pick
rooms one at a time from a limited selection or available op-
tions, However, after a miscount that resulted in five more
SAs than rooms available, SA room draw took on the frantic
atmosphere non-SAs fear,

The mistount proved an unwanted surprise for loo Gare
icy '11, who will be a new SA. “It was really stressful because
they had to give us someplace to live," Grit-toy said. “But we
didn’t think we would get any choiccr"

After realizing that there was a shortage oft-ooms,
the RLCs stopped room draw and met to decide what to do.
“It was a little tense and a little conﬁising," said KimrHinds
Brush, Loosehead RLC,“especially since itwas at the end and
all new staffmembcrs [were left to draw].”

The RLCs decided to add extra SA rooms to
Younker First. then to pits of l‘lniaaes,]aanes, and Cleveland,
and ﬁnally to the new group house added to room draw this
yeatt “We had already started to talk about [adding] a couple
ofthe floors for year after next,"said HindSrBtush.“[Tlae de-
cision] was going to be going through housing and making
sure that we could get rooms, so we kind of circumvented the
red tape." .

To help make sure that people were satisﬁed by
the process, the RLCs offered SAs the opportunity to trade
rooms until the next day at noon “Personally, I’m totally fine
with the way it ended up, it was just confusing and frustrating
at the time," said Susan Kikuch't'll, the second to last person
to pick betote the new rooms were opened. Kikuchi was able
to trade her north campus room for Cleveland Pit before the
deadline the next day

Most students affected were happy with the ﬁnal
result, even though it was confusing at the time. "Most of
the complaints we’ve gotten and rcquestwe’ve gotten to redo
room draw has come from current staff members [who are
not affected],” said Hinds—Brush.

“I don’t blame them because they all have a lot [0 do,
and obviously were short handed in RLCs," said Garrey, refer-
encing the eurrent lack ofa smounker RLC. “For the person—
allv it‘s worked out, but going thmu h it was very stressful.”
