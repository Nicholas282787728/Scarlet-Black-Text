To you, how important are organizations
like the Palestrnian Solidarity Group, orgur
nizarrons that advocate looking at the cone
flict from a Palestinian point ofvicw? How
important are they to activists such as your
selfand how important is the college campus in this debate?

If you look at it from the other side, namely what orgarlir
zations supporting Israel over Palestine are saying, there is a
real concern that they are losing the battle on college campuses.
They're losing the battle in general, and they’re losing Jewrsh
students in particular. 50 1 think one way you can look at the
question is that ifthey're worried about the ground that they’re
losing, there must be a reason for the battleground.

[A college campus] is the one place where you really are
able to speak freely and forthrighdy about what's going on in
the occupied territories The degree of censorship in the na-
tional medra is pretty strong. It’s not as bad as it used to bc7
there have been major improvements—but still the censorship
has been pretty severe and the one place where you still have
the option of speaking pretty candidly is in colleges. So I think
it’s pretty important.

You mentioned among Jewish students, in particular,
there’s going to be much more skepticism in the vein ofwhat
you've written aboutidte “holocaust industrthhis one~
sided portrayal lofthe lsrael-Palestine conflict}. so ifa typi-
cal Grinnell Conege Jewish student is beginning to he skepe
tieal, how would they deal with the older generation? what
would be a way to create a dialogue with them since some of
these people have really strongly held beliefs?

I think there are two avenues for dialogue. One is to show
that the other side is reasonable, that people are trying to find a

M5 Agril 25, 2008'
Norman Finkelstein talks on Israel, academia, reading

reasonable sertlerncnt to the confirct based on principles agreed

on by everyone iii the conflict, and to live in peace with their

dignity intact based on principles ofitrsrice. So for those to

whom uch an appeal is open,l thrnk that’s- how one should

go: stick strictly to the factual record, don’t exaggerate, certainly

don't misrepresent, and do this to show that there is a consensus

in the world community to stop the conflict n a any that air
lows all sides to live with dignity intact and with justice.

The other an >rodch, for those who don't care about all sides

, and only care about Jews, is to say that lsracl

is headed towards destruction, that it cer-

tainly cannot conrrnue indeﬁnitely to carry

on the wry it does: relentlessly rrt war with

its neighbors, constantly seeking out a hole

licose, bclllgcrcnt solutrorr to every conﬂict

[lt’s] like the famous Now Yor/m' cartoon of

the old Jewish couple looking at a television

screen and the television screen has a nnlslr

loom cloud on it and the caption roads: “So,

is it good for the Jews>" lfrhe only thing you

care about “is it good for the Jews," if you're

not interested in rnorality,you'rc not irrtereste

ed in justice, then even from the most narrow

of perspectives, the purely ethnic perspective, rr seems to me

that there are still excellent grounds for wan ng to resolve the

conﬂict and work towards a peaceful resolution of hostilities,

because I don't think that Israel can COHIIHUC on this course, I

think it will be destroyed,

You describe yourself many times as a ‘forensic scholar.‘
What‘s a forensic scholar?

It's a term I think a friend of mine coincdil wouldn't Call
it mine. Basically, what a forensic scholar does is he or she takes
what he or she reads seriously.

When you go to graduate school, basically what they teach
you in graduate school is how to pretend you read something
you actually didn’t. They assign you eight books a week and
you’re supposed to write your seminar papers. So you’re sup-
posed ro be reading 15 books week and everyone knows you're
not reading the books and you know you're not reading the
books. So you're supposed to walk around and pretend.

So what I do is I take the book seriouslyl read pretty carer
fully.I read the footnotes, and I check the footnotes, and I have
a curiosity about how an argument is but together. So 1 would
say no percent ofwhat I read 1 read twice. What you do find
is that a lor ofwhztt passes for scholarship is quite shoddy. [l]n
this particular fieldY the Israeeralestine conﬂict, there is not an
insignificant amount which is just sheer takery. At least that's
been my experience.

Where do you think academic freedom is on ncadcnr
ic campuses, given examples such as yorrrself and Ward
Churchill? [ChurchilL former professor at the University of
Colorado atBouldcr, wrote on rlrc/rrrtrcerfkrcnrng Chic/tort
which said that some people killed in the world Trade cen-
ter attacks provoked the attack. Churchill was later charged
with misconduct in his research and stripped ofhis tenure]

ldcn't thrnk it's so bild.Wilrd Chm-chill was an example of
a pohtrcrtl lynching I'm not i big Wind Churchill fan,but i did
read the report that was issued, and evamhrcd his scholarship.
And as 1 said I'm not a big rrn ofhrs,but that report simply d d
not provide evidence to strip his tenure. It chooses five or s'
examples ofhrs allegedly unseholarly scholarship, Bear in mind
that he wrote 40 books, so ﬁve or sir examples it already measly,
and orthe ﬁve or six. there was only one thrrr was signifrcanr.

My case was also peculiar because it became kind of a are
tronal campaign, not because of my politics pct se. but because
I’m active. 1 go tram college to college and I’ve created a fol-
lowing; l have a national reputation and an international onc
It'l had simply bcen a scholar, writing tor tr narrow academic
audience, they wouldn’t care. 1 am personally cf the Left, bur
my views are not very radical. There are many people out there
who advocrtc a onerstate settlement, advocate the abclrshmenr
oflsracl and all that, I'm not there. Tire reason I’ve caused so
much hysteria is because I’m politically activel was a peculiar
case. lf you were to ask the PEG how many acadernres they
bring, l'rn quite sure they‘ll tell you the number is quite small.
Academics do not do politics. They think they do, but they
dent on speaking out on the Israceralcstine issue, you could
really only name four or fiveThar's why they targeted me. I'm
one ofthc four or five. lfyou were to ask how many academics
have more or less the same politics as me, then itwould be four
or five hundred.

Is this particular issue one that incites this sort of divide,
or do you think there are other issues in academia?

No,Most academies have gotten into their brains that some
how writing all this flurf about post-modernism and all that
makes them radical. Well, they’re not being radical'rhey’re not
being anything, It‘s all a pose, and it's a very convenient pose
because it's all harmless,

Who cares what those people say,> They have no effect on
society, they get their grants, they get their departments and it
doesn't matter. A lot ofleftrlcaning people in academia have
gotten it into their heads that they’re doing something radical
by positing that the world actually doesn't eidsr.
