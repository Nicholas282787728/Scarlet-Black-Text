The man behind the mustache: security’s Russ Motta

BYJOI lNNv BUSE

Since the dawn of man, communities have
been bound together by storytellers. From a
betuded man in n cave to n mustnchcd man in
a uniform, rhe rradirlon oftnll tales lives on to»
day rn the lively and loud conversation orRuss
Motto, Security man in title and wise elder in
practice, Russ rs one of the deﬁning faces of
Grinnell staff.

Russ is recognizable to students in many
different situations. protecting the sidelines at

shrouding his pnsr in a haze to most students,

Russ’ career in law enforcement otigmaﬂy
stretches back to his high school days. An avid
rock climber from east of San Diego, he had a
deﬁning moment when he and a fliend were
climbing in the srerras and were beckoned by
shouts from a police ofﬁcer below them. "This
was ‘68." said Russ. “W hen a deputy sheriff
srarrs yelling ar you while you're on a rock, you
think ‘Oh my God, we're in troubled"

But insrcnd orscarching {or drugs or slaps
ping the rwo with trespassing clinrgcs, rhc orrre
cer asked for help in a search for a missing child.
Trekking over rhe top or dre mounrain, Russ
and his friend found the child strnndcd between
a steep, dry waterfall and a high dirt. After his
impromptu service, San Diego County quickly
hired Russ as a deputy sheriff specializing in
rock climbing. Two years of search and rescue
in the Slems left Russ desiring more, and so
he packed up and took off for the Flatrrons rn
Colorado’s Rockies.

While obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Russ
worked for the Uniitcrsity of Colorado Police
Department, until accepting a job at the Vail
Police Department. Even though he was cvcm

rually appoirrred Chief of Police, as his children
grew up, he began to realize there were healthier
places than Vail to raise a family.

“Children learn how to be ilduli's by WMCh’
ing adults behave," said Russ. “lfyou'rc living in
a recreational area, [adults] are doing adult rcce
rcarion,Tlicy do too much alcohol, they don't
sleep, rhcy mnkc loud noises . sounds just like
college, but it's a ski resort," uss and his wife,
who is originally from Grirrnell,rrlrirnarely made
the decision to move to Glinncll.

Russ’s Glinnell career did not begin in the
security ofﬁce, but instead at the circulation desk
in hurling library His anrrcs proved to be too
much for the silent conﬁnes of the libmly, and
continuous complaints from the third and fourth
ﬂoors began to roll in soon arrcr his hiring, “A
library job shouldn't hc boring; it should be cxe
tiring and our," snid Russ. “Everyone ar Burling
\vns having a great rirnc while 1 was rherc and
so was 1. Wed get to singing, telling srorics and
dancing, and then the students would join in."

Russ was quickly moved out of the circula—
tion desk to intellibmry loan, where he worked
until he uns offered the job ofbullding Grrrrnell
College's tirst security department with current
Director ofSccutity Stephen Briscoe,

Since the birth ofGrinncll's security depart
ment. Russ has dealt with smiling students and
tall tales more than suspects and threats, and he
sometimes takes on unconventional rolcs.“l am
a fully accredited, ofﬁcial kcg toss rcfcrcc." said
Russ. “M: and rhe other securiry guys nrc so to
tally arbitrary rhar no one nrgucs with what we
say: 1 haue rhe ﬁnal word.”

Beyond keeping college students safe and
fair, he keeps alive the tradition offacially—haired
storytellers, having sported his signature, bushy
mustache since his late teens. “His mustache,"
said Charles Netzet ’11, “is srrnply majestic."
