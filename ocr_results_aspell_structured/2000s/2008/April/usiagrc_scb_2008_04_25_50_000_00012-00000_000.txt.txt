Words of praise for queers, admins 8c the CDO

Say it with a parade

Parades are a great tradition. Perie
odr At best, there are a series of ornate
ﬂoats, horses and ﬁre-trucks. Arid even
at worst. people in some sort of costume
or uniform throw candy at spectators.
There's nothing

not to love,

College will

have its first

Pride Parade in

rccenr memory

and it could not

crimes earlier this semester, the queer
community has done an admirable job
to create positive social spaces and it"-

students, The parade will undoubtedly
infuse its participants with enthusiasm
and a sense ofcommuniry.

But additionally, the parade will
hnng the message orcomniuniry trust
and support into the broader college
community Even unintentional one

lockers must take notice when students
deliver it on the streets of Grinnell.
While the drag show is fun and ar-
ﬁrming, its audience chooses to come
to support the community. In this case,
even those who have tried to look away
will see students
marching tor
gerhcr in
support of
Pride and the
Grinnell queer

community.
The parades
only weakness
is its length—two blocks from Nor~
ris ro Loose. it’s unlikely [hill many
from town will get the chance to see
this show of solidarity. Relations hc-
twcen the Grinnell queer community
and town have often scented tense, but
during rhc hale-crime incident, mimy
townspeople came forward in support
of Grinncll's LGBTQ community.
While the queer community is mit-
ing its ﬁrst step by simply having the
parade, we hope in future years, it will

make it to downtown Grinnell. Be-
cause every message is best delivered in
parade format.

Awesome admins

The title student Affairs implies
a connection to student life, but for
a long time, it has not been clear just
how much administrators know about
lives of the Gtinncll student popular
tion. How much can they know about
dining without curing the food? How
much can they
know about hous-
ingwirhouiwalleing
through the dorms?

Freckles across America : friends or foes?

Darcy Ward ’09 examines the true nature of freckles, what causes them, what they are, and their effect

The other day, I was looking at a map ofthe Units
ed stares recently featured in stirrreeNeaes depicting
the areas where mumps has become a prohiem.This
was interesting because the only people that seemed
to be affected were people 18‘24 years old living in
“Midwestern college towns” which seems alarms
ingly speciric. Demo-
gnphically speaking,
mumps is our to get me,
They might as well have
said mumps has a thing
for softball players who
enjoy red wine and early
90’s romantic comedies.

Anyway, so 1 was
staring at this map. which was mostly nudercolored
(nude Caucasian, or course—thank you pantyhose
industry), hut in the Midwest there were little dots of
warious shades of brown where mumps was a prob—
lem. lowa, for perhaps rhe ﬁrst time in its existence,
was one of the darkest brown states.

This sent me spiraling deep into thought. Not
about how mumps might be plotting to get me.
but how the dots looked like freckles. So I googled
freckles,

This is why l have a hard time doing homework.

Turns out they are a “pigment disorder." Now,

Dishguring disease that they are, they seem to add a
little character to their owners. Where would Pippi

weird little redhead chillin‘ with a horse.

maybe we Scots get a little fire in the loins thinking
about well fire—colored loins.

He suggests that since up to 40
percent of Scots carry the gene for

offspring,

Normally, when skin is exposed to sunshine,
cells called melanocytcs produce melanin, In people
prone to freckling, some of the melanocytes produce
more melanin than others, resulting in blotchcs of
pigmentation,

Ifthc freckles occur in places where the sun don't
shine (the loins, say) that is another thing altogether.
Those are called “auxiliary" (armpir) freckles, and are
a pretty good sign that the nervous system disorder
“Neurof‘ibromatosis Type i”is present.
