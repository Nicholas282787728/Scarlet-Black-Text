Changes come to Grinnell Corps

m, SAMIRA SADEQUE

Scnin -s looking for something to do next year now have a
new opt'

starting in 2009, Grinnell Corps. a postgraduate relr
iowship program for graduating Grinnell students. wrll otter
a sccond position in New Orleans. In addition to thc current
New Orleansrbased fellowship With Jericho Roads Housing
1n ive, graduating seniors will have the oppornrnity to work
with the Lowererntl'l Ward Neighborhood Empowerment
Network Association (NENA),The position in Grinncll will
move from the Grinnclercwbcrg School District to Mid-
Iowa Commrrnrty Acrion (MICA),

NENA is a community organization in the Lower Ninth
Ward of New Orleans that was created in the aftermath of
Hui ricane Katrina. According to its website, “NENA addresses
not only the immediate recovery needs created by the storms
destruction, but also the institutional neglect and disinvcstnient
that plagued the neighborhood long before Katrina."

According to Doug cutchins '93, director of Service and
Social Commitment, NENA was chosen after considering what
types Dfpi'ograms ﬁt with Grinnell corps' mission. “While ot-
fcring a fellowship in a particular organization, we loolc at three
things," Cutcliins said. “The interest of the students, how well
the organizations are able to host our students, and a commur
niry that is in nced orour service."

srnce Katrina, New Orleans has become a popular service
area for Griniicll students. most recently with ReNew Orleans
sending groups there during breaks. “Our iii-st group [of vole
unteers] went around three years back," said Dean of Rclrgrous
Life Deana Shorb. “The interest of the students was reﬂected
in the fact that a group of thirty people went although there

was accommodation for only twentythrec.”

Musarrat Rahman '10 sard she felt that Ncw Orleans offers
an rtleal place for a Guaaell corps fellowship. ”New Orleans is
the perfect location for students interested in doing community
service,"she s. d “Not only is the community in need, it is also
an amazing plncc to be ”

cutehins said last year, when the ﬁrst Grinncll corps rel-
lowship was offered in New Orleans at Jericho Road, there was
a significant rise in the number ofapplicants.

In addition to creating a new position in New Orleans, the
Grinnell Corps position in Grinnell will return to MICA, a
non-proﬁt that serves childrcn and families in central town, by
providing health care, Head start and weatherization assistance
among other services. Fellows have worked with the Gtinnellr
Newburg school District the past two years, The position
changes location every two years,

According to Cutchins, MICA is an ideal location for a felt
lowship. “[MICA] was the most welcoming. and most impor
tantly, this was the one program where students were very well
integrated with the community," he said.

Shorb said MICA was also chosen because it demonstrated
need. “MICA is also a commuarty organizatron that is Vcly
much in need~onc ofthe factors that we look at while choos—
ing a program for ceCorps,”she said,

The past four fellowships rn Grinnell were hosted at the
Galaxy Youth Centre, Domestic Violence Alternative/Sexual
Assault Center, MICA and Crinnelerewburg School Dis-
trict.

In addition to its domestic locations, Grinnell Corps offers
fellowships in Namibia, Lesotho, China, Greece and Macao.

help people when they drink too much
and to just make sure that everybody rs
being safe and respoasrble and be an ard to whoever’s throwing
that party that is financially responsible for any damages that
occur. It’s just a good presence. We see ourselves as a tool for
students," he said.

Officials said that they have identified three parties in
particular which, based on their histories of fines and alcohol
problems, could potentially bcncflt from the presence of ACE
security—anlc, GcrbilFest and Loose and Ready,

organizers were quick to emphasize, however, that the pro-
gram is not compulsory. “What we're trying to do is just see it
we can be more proactive and see if we can not get those tunes
in the first place," said Dean of Students Travis Greene.

“We don't want to be in the business otparty police, And
we don't have a system or policy set up where we would require

In addition to identifying potential problem parties, Dough—
arty said that Security members could be provided to those par-
ties that ask for them.

“It wouldn’t be an automatic thing,” he said. "But we’ve got
this incredible resource and students who are really well trained
and well equipped and [can provide] the party organizers with
some kind of opportunity to opt in to that itthey relr it could
help their event be more effcctivc."

Anything suggesting a greater college presence at lounge
parties could still prompt a student reactionWhilc Hcderman
said his experience with security was incredibly positive, lic said
that the very presence of Security members could ranklc some
students. “When there are like 20 of those students in their
