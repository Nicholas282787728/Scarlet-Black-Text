College selects incoming Class of 2012

BY CLAIRE REEDER

After a grueling selection process the Class of2012 is
getting ready to head our way.

The Class of 2012 will feature fewer international stu-
dents than in past years, but will cover more countries,
while the domestic geographical representation remains
similar to previous classes. Despite being separated by
vast distances, the “Grinnell Twelves" have been able to
interact via Facebook.

The Class of 2012 will also represent more countries
than in the past, particularly from
the Middle East. “Next year we
will have students here from Iran,
Egypt, and if everything works
out, from Iraq,” said Director of
Admission Nancy Maly '61. New
students also hail from other cur-
rently unrepresented countries,
including Albania, Bosnia, Brazil
and Costa Rica.

Similar to the current firsts
yoars, the majority oilnrernnrlonal
students will be from Southeast
Asia, according to Mnly. The large
csr applicant pool came from China. and it was also the
most competitive: of the 400 Chinese applicants, only 15
were admitted ,

There will be little domestic geographical difference
between the class of 2012 and ZOllsTheie ale more in—
coming students from the MidrAtlanlic, New England
and the Midwest, with fewer from the South and South—
west than last year.The nilmbci oflowans remains rough-
ly the same from past yctus.

According to Dean of Admission and Financial Aid

”A group lll<e ’6rlnnell lwelves’ [on

Seth Allen, Admission callbratcs geographic diversity
within and between classes. “We continue to try to hale
ance out and tweak the classes geographically,"said Allen.
“We'd like to see more students from the East and West
Coasts."

A Facebook group, “The Grinnell Twelves," created by
Marisol Casorla '11, has offered incoming students a peek
into their future at Grinnell. Many incoming students
have been using Facebook to make early acquaintances
and find answers to question about Grinnell.

“A group like ‘Grinnell Twelves’
is helpful because I can Ilsk any
questions that probably wouldn’t
bode well with counselors, like
which teachers are best," said Salil
Kalghatgi ’12 of Iowa City. “It was
good ﬁnding our which other stu-
dents would be on the golf team
with me next year just so I can
talk to them about the upcoming
season, and I’m sure other people
have starred talking because of
similar hobbies or tastes." Discus-
slon board topics include “favorite
music?," “Why Grinnell?," and one where they discuss
potential majors.

Regardless ofmitial encounters made via the Internet,
incoming srudents say rhcy arc excited for {acerwrﬂtcc
interaction. “Knowing that people lschave differently one
line than rhcy do in poi-son, I'm really just more cxcitcd
to actually moot people in August," said Tucker Bush '12
ofStr Louis, MO,

The new Gtinncll Class onOlZ will arrive on campus
