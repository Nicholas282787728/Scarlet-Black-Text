You're a proliﬁc author, known for your
plays, novels and translations. it seems like
the common thread in your work is an explot
ration of contemporary
Muslim identity What
prompts you to focus on
this theme?

The theme is religion.
In every piece, whit intcrt
esrs mciand this applies
not only to lslam—is the
ielarionship between hue
mans and religion, or the
relationship between 507
ciery and religion, or the
relationship between one
individual and God. I ask,
why is this relationship so
conflicted> And that's as
much in Western society
as in the cultures of the Middle East and the
Arab world.

in your opi ion, how did we get here?
What led us to this crisis, at

”It’s true that we In tel/eeiua/r are
in crisis, We’re ﬁring at a [ime of
Violence; we’re Iiwng 010 time of
probe and afﬁrmation Of/denl/t
tier, Me a culiuta/ bonﬁre. And
(ii/m VOIKE’Siie/lé’dii/E voicese
don’thave a plate in that”
Mohamed Kacimi

iamily I drink I spent my adolescence, my
young adulthood, my entire developmental
triiectory tiying to leave, to get free. to IMF
tiijv myself, to totally break with that culture
I'm at the crossroads, and have been for years,
between Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I’m
an arlieist who spends his time running after
God.

In an interview you
did with Lhc ncwssitc
Lihe’mtimi two years ago,
you said that Arab iiitelt
lectuals “speak only to
themselves," that they’re
“preaching in the desert.“
Do you identify with this
group of rhinkers? Are
they your colleagues?

There’s a ccitain bank-
ruptcy among intcllectir
als today, in France as wcll
as in the Arab world. But
more speciﬁcally, it's trite
that we intellectuals are in
crisis. We're living at a time
ofviolence; wc’rc living at a time of praise and
afﬁrmation of identities, like a cultural bon-
ﬁre. And calm voices—ieﬂective voices—don’t
have a place in that. Inevir

 

thisjuncturein history?

At this juncture, socictr
ies have already been swept
iiwayiall societies, in the
South as well as the North—
by a vision of 20th-century
utopia. The utopia was to
be a society without class
distinctions, an egalitarian
society So we ﬁnd modern
sucierics,denicd rhcii utopia,
unable to achieve the rcvtr
lutioniry dream, ivill _ ifr

 

tably, there will be an intclc
lectual who dcconstructs
that worldview, who dccon-
structs those tiuths. And
unavoidably, his voice will
not be tolcratcd, because it
contradicts public opinion,
. An inrellccnial is out ofsync
with a society Caught tip in
- emotions instead oftaking a
rational look at reality.

__ You’ve spoken rather
: negatively about the intel—

 

 

rlieir expectations, will s ift
their dreams, will shift their
utopia into the religious sphere.

This seems to apply to Western societies,
but do you feel this is the case with traditions
ally Arab or Muslim societies as well?

Thar is the case, and even more so. Today,
we see a return to religion in the United States
as well as Europe, even in France. But in the
Arab world, the tendency is exacerbated, be
cause those societies have more fragile struc—
tures and loss of a tradition, lcss ofa cultural
foundation. In the Arab world, you'll find soci-
crics without any kind offrccdom.Thcre’s no
freedom of thought, no freedom ofcxpress'ion,
no freedom for the individual, no freedom to
love, no freedom to create. so religion assumes
the duties of all the spaces for individual ex-
pression that are forbidden to society

Where do you situate yourself in this relic
gious sphere? How do you identify?

I'm originally from a very, very religious

lectual's fate. So what do
you hope to accomplish
with your work? What do you expect will
come of your novels, your translations, your
plays?

In the sixties, we saw that the Marxists'
weapon—even before then, at the turn of the
ccntumwas literature and poetry. Little by
little, we saw that literature doesn't change the
world So, maybe I write because I see clearly
lireranirc's lack otinflucncc. Most importanrly,
I write to preserve some of the humor that
were losing. My work is intended to defuse
some ofthc darkness ofthis pessimist world.

Who are you trying to reach with your
work—the Francophone world, the Arab
world, everyone? You're here in the 0.5.,
where many students would say that the
francophone world has nothing to do with
them. So how do you respond to that? Why
come here to speak to us?

ldon’t know ifl imagine a particular audi-

once. But as writing for the people who take
the time to read my work, to watch, to listen.

What can American students learn from
your work? How should we use the ideas and
theories in your pieccs?

it's really for me to say, “what can 1 learn
from the United States?” It’s more for me to
learn, as an author, fium Algeria, living in
France, and having an enormous number of
preconceptions about the United states, just
as everyone does] had the chancc to wolk in
Tennessee on a piece called "Babel" and to see
the considerable diilctenccs between our cont
ceptions of that Countiyﬂl jumbled, whiny

cult that cats McDonald's drunk, and who all
vote for the tightiand to come back and tcs»
tify both to the vitality and the opposition that
exists in that country, and to the opcn-minded~
ness you find in the United States.Whatreally
got me excited during my first visit to Know
ville with the Clarence Brown Theatre was the
intellectuals lack ofopnot; worldview. People
ask questions without saying, “we have all the
answers." And this distance in the American
point ofview really fascinated me.

Dan Deacon and his idiosyncratic style (or lack thereof)

Electronic musician and showman plays Gardner at 9:00 pm. tonight with home-grown talent opening for him

To those who have ever had the title “Hardest Working
Man in Show Business"rhrust upon thcmiquit posturing and
bow down to Dan Deacon, the epitome of the working class
hero and dclivcrcr of joyous and unique electronic music to
Gardner 9:00 pm. tonight.

Deacon has earned his crown. consider his overall unpret
tentious appearance. Deacon is fat, sweaty, balding, givcn to
thrift store bargains in his choice ofclothing and seemingly un-
aware of the ridiculousness othis dancing style He deliberately
creates this appearance; he is also a classically trained composer
who has had a hand in the design of his tour’s elaborate effects
and instruments.

And then there was his 23-day Greyhound Bus rour,whcrc
he are only 58 cans orcorn, 58 cans ofbcans, 58 servmgs of
peanut butter and 58 rice cakes. He carried minimal equipment
on that tour by necessity and has often done so since then, but
the mere quantity of his equipment cannot express his music's
volume and intensity and his dedication to his craft, which he

has worked on over eight albums and countless shows.

Deacon is certainly a showman. He has printed off indie
vidual lyrics sheets for his audience, moved all ofhis equipment
into the audience from the stage and designed an “Ultimate
Reality" tour with two drummers and an elaborate audiovisual
setup. on another occasion, he finished a summer festaal pert
formince shut down for overcrowding by throwing another
show in the same City in a warehouse that night.

He displays an idcalistic,child-hkc cnthusiasm for his thrift-
store relics, his un-cool shenanigans and the many strange and
beautiful impulses he manages to fit into an album or a show.
on his breakthrough album, Spaniman o/l/Je Ringr, his epic
song “Wham City" (also the namc of his Baltimoic-bascd
music collective) sprawls over nearly 12 minutes and multiple
mood changes. Near the triumphant finish, the pulsing bcat
suddenly stops, and he and his friend scream unaccompanied
about an imaginary “mountain of snow," 3 “casLlc enclosed," a
“fountain" from which “ﬂows gold into a huge hand/ held by a

bear who has a sick baud."

His shows are as cathartically sweaty as they are hilarious.
The key to Deacon‘s popularity is his infectious enthusiasm and
“sick" one-man band of electronic beats that can bc licard no-
where else.

openers Josh and Anand also promise bring some of their
sweet beats to the show. After four years or” playing around
Grinnell and other parts oflowaJosh Lindgtcn’os and Anand
Balasubrahmanyiin v08 are set to release their new CD Herc
Cone roe Crawl on Friday night. “‘VVc saw The Blow when they
played at Grinncll our freshman year and we decided to make a
bind with beats from our laptops," said Lindgren.

Bird Names, the second opener, features Davad Lincal ’04
and brings the Grinnell weirdness back home with their strange
folkcinﬂcctcd sound collages, which should help set the mood
before Deacon takes the stage.
