“What would you
say to a blind man wear—
ing anywhere from one
to ﬁve wind instruments
and another half—dozen
African percussion in—
struments, who has just
ﬁnished a rap about a
woman who makes love
to a computer? Rahsaan
Roland Kirk is such a
man, and Saturday night
in Roberts Theater we
will all have the chance
to hear see and feel the
aforementioned facts.”

PLAID: Not only were seven out of ten members of con brio sporting
the fashionable pattern at their most recent concert, but this trend has
been storming the dining hall in recent weeks.

 

 

 

 

CHOCOLATE SOY MILK: It was so great that Grinnell got to be part of
an experiment testing the popularity of this product, but after tempting
us with this tasty drink it doesn’t seem right to take it away for good.

 

 

 

 

 

'LlNGERIE MASQUERADlNG AS HALLOWEEN COSTUMES: Seriously,
folks. It’s only three weeks till Fetish. Save your skin and wear some-

thing creative.

Grammar prohlem revisited

For the sake of students of writing this IS a
friendly riposte to Kevin Cashman’s rant that his
"142 words or less" is a better choice than the “...
or fewer" in the Random Rants inbox and that
less “is perfectly acceptable with numbcts.” De-
spite the common use of “X words or less." the
rule for standard English is “fewer things but less
‘stuFf’,"and words—the numbers are not relevant
here—which fewer implicitly modiﬁes in the
contested phrase, are things.The corresponding
“stuff” would be text, writing, et ul.Thus, fewer
words but less text. See further, H.W Fowler, A
Dictionary of Modern English Usage, 2nd ed.,

. s.v. less(en), 3. I have now used fewer [words]

than 140 words.

What about the rollerbladers?

1. Sidewalk: The sidewalk neat to the railroad
tracks leading towards High Street is ridiculous.
For starters, there’s no ramp. If you’re in a wheel—

‘ chair/biking/rollcrblading this is h renl problem.

Secondly, during business hours, the sidewalk leads
directly into parked cars“. so even if you dismount
to scale the curb, you end up having to squeeze your
wtly between two cars, trying as hard as you can not
to take out the side mirrors.l wish it would be ﬁxed
or something.

2. Minivan on 5th: do not horlk your horn at me
ifyou think I'm in your way. Drive around.lt's not a
busy road und it’s not rocket science. K thx.
