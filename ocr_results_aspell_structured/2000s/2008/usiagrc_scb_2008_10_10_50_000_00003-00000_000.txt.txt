it was the same time as the Vice-Presidential
debate.

Trustee Todd Linden said he was uncct—
rain as to why there was no option for students to present to
the tmstecs.“Genctally we leave it up to SGA to decide things
such as the student fonims," said Linden.

Instead of a forum, SGA hosted a viewing of the Viccr
Presidential debate for students and trustees, Time was allots
ted for informal conversation afterwards, but Morake said few
students attended. The lack of an open forum this trustee visit
was not a concern ofhers.

“The trustees are coming two more times, I think that
should give [students] ample time,"Morakc said.

While some of the Cabinet members are new to SGA, 7,1,

from p. 1

most all are new to each other. Most were not familiar with
each other before applying to cabinet.

This type ofdivcrsity"has been keeping SGA a little more
broad than it has been in the past," Hoye said. “It’s bringing a
lot ofnew opinions and light into SGA."

jcrl Fields '11 works with cabinet through Ethnic Party Ase
sociation and appreciates the work they do. “They show a lot
of concern,” Fields said. “When I interact with SGA members,
they're really really helpful."

Phil Hagen ’10, a third-term senator for Looschcad, says it
might still be too early in the year to determine ifthe cabinet is
effective. “I think they’re going to be [effective],” Hagen said, “I
feel they’re all suited for the job."

Endowment crunched by falling markets

liYJIM MALEWITZ

Few institutions have been spared the pain of the recent
global ﬁnancial crisis, and Grinnell College is no exception.
As stock prices continue to fall, so has the Wilue of Grinneil's
endowment. But while the College’s ﬁiture ﬁnancial status re-
mains largely unclear, administrators are relatively optimistic
about the college’s vitality

Over the past 15 months, the wine of Grinnell's endow-
ment has fallen about 17 percent, Standing at $17 billion in
june of 2007, the endowment fell by about $193 million, or
over 11 percent, through June 2008. It lost an additional $100
million during the most recent quarter, leaving the endowment
around $1.4 billion, according to David Clay, vicespresident
and treasurer of the College.

Even with the large ﬁnancial loss, it is difﬁcult to ascer-
tain the effects of the ﬁnancial crisis on Grinneli’s endowment
and long term planning. according to administrators. “It’s so
hard to tell what we’re in the midst ofcconomically,” Clay said.
“But my guess is that [the market will recover] later rather than
sooner.”

The short-term impacts of the ﬁnancial turmoil will most
likely be minor, President Russell K. Osgood said. The cndOWr
ment took a similar hit during his second year as president.
“[That loss] really didn’t have much of an impact on the col—
lcge,” he said. “We try to manage the College so that its operas
tions are not aﬂ’ected by this.”

But if the market continues its decline, some of the Col—
lege’s projects will likely bc postponed. “The major effects will
be on capital projects we haven't started," Osgood said The
projects include library renovation and windmill construction,

which the College did not project to start until next year prior
to the crisis.

Integral to the college’s financial management is the capital
reserve fund, a holding account used for future capital projects,
such as construction, which also serves as ﬁnancial protection
for the college. Currently at 561 million, the money for this aCs
count is held outside of the endowment in the form of cash and
bonds, ensuring that current projects can be completed dur—
ing ﬁnancial crunches. “Unlike just about every college in this
country, we’ve got this cushion that protects us in this kind of
situation," said Trustee Clint Korver ’89.

The College’s broader investment strategy may help the
college cvcntuany cscapc the ﬁnancial crisis with little realized
loss. Historically, the college has retained certain stocks for long
periods of time, “We trade to hold on for the longer term,” Os-
good said,

Administrators, like Clay, hope to ride out the ﬁnancial
storm by holding onto current investments. “We believe that
[our portfolios] market value will eventually come back,” Clay
said. “As long as we can smy liquid and we aren't forccd to realr
izc [those losses]."

While members of the administration have avoided pes-
simism when discussing the College's finances, they also recog
nize the need to proceed with cautiont"We arc all increasingly
cautious and careful," said Clay. "We need to be thoughtful and
disciplined."

At the moment, Osgood said it would be “wildly specular
tivc” to make further comments on how the fall in the endow-
ment will affectiong—term planning “We don’t really do a seri-
ous revaluation until the end ofthe year," he said.

Own your words

or TESS/i CHEEK AND MANDO MONTANO

Starting the lVlonday after tall break, a group or students
representing various itlcntityebascri anti social activist groups
will ask you to "Own Your Words,"

Headed by Leah Krandcl '09, the participants in tht Own
Your Words campaign will hang posters throughout campus
with words and phrascs that, while commonplace for somc,cun
often be offensive to others, By highlighting such words, thc
campaign organizers hope to increase awareness ofhow word
choice may vertcntly offcntl people, On Oct 30, the last day
ofthc camp gn, organizers will host in open discussion in the
JRC about the words and their various meanings

The goal ofthc c. puign is to cncotuagc the Gtiniicll com»
mnniry to better considcr the significance of our word choice,
“By cting together we can make connections and increase .ice
countability amongst the Grinncll community with the lan-
guagc we use," [(i-andel said.

some of the language that Will be mcludcd on posters inn
eludes welds most students would identify as offensive, like
"nigger" and “fag". But othcr, more common Wolds will not
be left our. The implications of lcss stigmatized words such as
“lame" and “gangster” will also be posted and discussed.

“For example, QPOC [chiccr Pco le of Color] might put
gay is norbeing stupid',but thou FTP FrccThc Planet] might
also put ‘rree huggers like the economy too'," said Voicebox ads
ministrutor Emily sticvcr '09 who is also participating in the
campaign.

Krandel, who is involved in several campus activist organir
zations, said she drew upon her wide experience in the different
groups to build a campaign that brings together a variety or
people. “This campaign could be run by any campus group,"
said Krandcl, “so why not do it all together?"

Charisma Montfott ’11, a member of Concerned Black
Students, expressed a desire to make connections across campus
groups and include the full spectrum ofbackgrounds on cam
pus, “We don’t want to be a small, exclusive segment. We want
to be as open as we can be,"Montfort said. “Own Your Words is
about diversifying and bringing the campus together."

Although the campaign encourages accountability and
awareness in word choice, it also respects an individuals lin-
guistic freedom.

“The goal is to get people thinking about the words they
use.” Stiever said. “It’s not about policing people or saying this
language is bad, don't use it."

In addition to reﬂecting on offensive language, the cam-
paign's ﬁnal discussion will focus on how to encourage per-
sonal accountability towards language. Though the campaign
does not aim to tell students what they can and cannot say, it
docs ask the community to question the real meaning of their
words.

Report card .——.

the Investment Committee recognizes
”0'" P-1 the importance of socially-responsible
decisions and it selects investments and investment mans
agcrs whose conduct is consistent with the core values of the
college"

The college’s foremost ﬁnancial manager, Southeastern
Asset Management, Inc, reﬂects the college’s sclfeproclaimed
belicf in socially-responsible investing A clause in their vot-
ing procedure states that “Southeastern recognizes the overall
beneﬁt that is provided to society in general when its portfoe
lio companies act in a responsible manner as a good corporate
steward in environmental, social, and ethical manners."

Some administrators,such as Marci Sortor, vice president of
Institutional Planning, said they agreed with the need to cons
tinually examine current college practices.

“The critical thing has to be behaviors,” Sortor said. “You
eannotjust expect that it‘s going to be the college and the £01,
lcgc's cndowmcnt that's going to make everything better. We
ourselves have to be performing better."

Despite the poor mark, the college has taken steps to move
in the right direction. Recently, the college has crcctcd wind
turbines, added two hybrid vehicles to its collection, and cre-
ated the Dorm Environmental Coordinator position to serve as
sustainability coordinators within thc dorm.

Although Grinnell received a 13-, the report provides an op-
portunity for intros ection and discussion of future solutions.
“I think [the survcleis a good tool to gather information,"said
Pavlovic, it also, howcvcr, “gets us excited about things we’re
doing."
