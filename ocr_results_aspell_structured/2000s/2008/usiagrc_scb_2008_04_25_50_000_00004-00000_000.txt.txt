Barney Frank stumps for Leonard Boswell

BY DAVID H, MONTGOMERY

Leoniitd Boswell may have all the resources of incum-
heney behind him in the democratic congressional primary,
but he seems to he taking his primary challenge from former
state Rep. Ed Fallon seriously. On Saturday, Boswell brought
out the hcavy artillery against lus liberal challenger: the acid
wit of liberal lion Barney Frank, an openly gay Massachusetts
Congressman and powerful committee chairman.

Around 50 students and town residents showed up to JRC
101 late Saturday afternoon to heat Frank make the case for
why voteis should send Boswell back to Washington for a Saw
enth term.

From the standpoint ofpolirical entertainment, at the very
least, it was an hour oftiine well spent. Frank spcnt close to
halfan hour with crinnell students cracking jokes and trying
to persuade them why thcyipresumably more liberal than
the moderate Boswell—should vote fol the incumbent over
rhe very progressive Fallon, Frank's argument; that Boswell is
a loyal Democrat,

“[Boswell] is an unyielding supporter, when we need him,
of the rights orthe gay and lesbian and bisexual community.”
Frank said. “Every time I have gone to him. [saying] we need
your vote for this, we need your vote for this—s1 stopped ask-
ing for his Vote, because I didn't have to. He volunteers it."

In an interview after his speech, Frank was blunt about why
he had traveled to Iowa to campaign for Boswell. “It would be
a disaster if he lost," Frank said. “If we send a message to
the Democrats that if they don't adhere to somehody's view
orlertist purism, then we don't win any votes in the House.
That's a recipe for marginalization ofthe Democrats, to have
a guy like Len lose." -

Whether or not Frank changed anyvores, students at the
event seemed to appreciate his candor.

“I thought that Chairman Frank made a pretty good case
tor Boswell as a good communicator between the more cone
servative Democrats and the more Progressive Democrats,"
said Matt Horowiu'lo, who said he was undecided.

Boswell, who had asked Frank to campaign for him after
consulting with Grinnell Campus Democrats, said that he
thought the event went “very well," and that he was not wor-
ried that Frank, an openly gay liberal, would cause a backlash

“Some people might think so, hut I think we're beyond

that point,"Boswell said.

Fallon is an underdog in a largely ignored
primary, and much ororinnell's student body
is much more aware of the continuing presi-
dential candidacies than the state's congress
sional primary. “rm totally undecided about
which candidate I'm going to vote tor," said
Caitlin Fuller ‘11, who was present at the
event.

friendly. His liheral attitudes, such as oppo-
sition to the Iraq war, earmarks and corpor
rate interests, students said, are what attract
them to his campaign. “I’m in the coalition
of Progressive Democrats," said Raji Pokhrel
’08,“l'vc been working on getting to know his
stance on issues,"

After his speech and a series or ques-
tions, Fallon stayed around to ask about that
night’s student gatherings. After debating
over whether to go visar the Grille, Fallon ac-
cepted an invitation to that night’s Grinnell
Democrats meeting, Fallon hopes his persise
tence in cultivating college support will take
him to Washington.
