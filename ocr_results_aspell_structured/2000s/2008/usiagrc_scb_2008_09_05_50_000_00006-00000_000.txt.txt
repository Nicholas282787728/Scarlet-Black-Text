Shimomura questio

BY SVEDA SADEQUE

Great artists often express their resents
, ments in ways that do not leave much room for
humor: Roget Shimomura, a japanesrAmeri-
can who has faced discrimation his whole life,
definitely fits into this category of an artist
who is grappling with a history ofpain. From a
childhood in an internment camp to the more
subtle forms of racism that he experiences to:
day (one person at a recent auction asked him
if he was “from here"), Shimomura has plently
otdarlc material. But through the use of comic
book imagery and absurd, provocative painte
ings, he has managed to he both funny and
expressive,

Currently, Grinnell is hosting an art exhir
bition of Shimomuta’s paintings in Faulconer
Gallery from Aug, 29 to Oct. 25. With his
family, third-generation American Shimomue
ra was moved to an internment camp when he
was only three. Although he later completed
his education from at University ofWashings
tor-i, the nightmare ofharing once lived amidst
barbed wires and guards has never left him,
“He deals with a sense of history and cultural
identity," said Tilly Woodward, curator of the
Falconer Gallery His art takes this history and
places it in a modern context.

In the paintings and sculptures that are
exhibited at the gallery, one can easily see
the story that Shimomura tells. Each paints
ing holds a different story, but they all have
the same theme of torture, frustration and a
grudge against the alienation that Shimomnra
has felt his whole life. The \‘mys he has ac-
cepted and critiqued this grudge remain criti»
cal to his search for meaning. “There are many
ways to answer this question of identity, and he
proves it," Woodward said.

one of these ways is in his “American
Diaries." This series depicts the feelings that
Shimomura’s grandmother expressed in her
journal while in the internment camp. one of
these paintings depicts a meal consisting solely
of bread. Most compelling about this painting
is neither the American food not the dissatr
isfied person seated behind it, but a pair of
chopsticks lying by the plate the food is served
in. This painting satirizes the absurd discon-

nection‘ with home that the people living in
the camp had to face,

Throughout the gallery, you can frnd many
paintings through which Shimomura reaches
out to the people of his own world and those
who share his life experiences.

He has chosen paintings and sculptures as
his protest and in embracing this challenge, he
has won the hearts of many not only for his
breathtaking works ofart, but also because of

t

the intellect with which he has created them
and the emotions that he has invested in them.
This intellect and questioning has been key to
Pop American art since its conception.

“The work is extremely inspirationalr" said
Victoria Vertilo '12. Vertilo loves the combir
nation of comical paintings and Pop Art, and
she found the use of bright colors, although
controversial to the theme of suffering, quite
fascinating, However. she did not feel that

Shimomura expressed his emotions offrustra»
tion fully because of his bright colors.

Falconer Gallery has consistently focused
on providing students with international art as
a way to challenge their preconceptions. in re
cent times, there have also been art exhibitions
from Morocco and Portugal. “Art gives one
a chance to engage with and explore cultures
other than their own," said Woodward.

Hip-hop legend plays classic album for students

'Cerebral’, chess—playing hip-hop artist reprises his dense mid-nineties work in Harris tonight

When l‘llp'liop artist GZA comes to cam-
pus today, he wll.l he a refreshing reminder of
lripshop before its fixation on grills, shorties
and blingt While the GrFunk rhythms of the
West Coast were glorifying the hraacn hedoe
nisrn and mindless violence of gangster life,
GZA and his VVu~Tang Clan deployed an ar-
senal oflyticnlly incisive and cerebral tracks to
drop knowledge.

GZA, also known as “The Genius," prides
himself on his expressive lyrics and his abils
ity to paint a portrait of his own hard-knock
life as well as more general philosophical ex-
positionsThese attributes are best exemplified
on his second album Liquid Swaldr, which he
will perform (nearly) in its entirety tonight in
HarristThe album, which was released in 1995
and launched GZA's career, features traclts
broaehing subjects from lobby drug deals in
his Brooklyn youth to his religion. phrlosophy,
and Black nationalism. Despite the dispas
rate topics, the album successfully weaves the
tracks into a coherent tapestry with the come
mon thread that they all intimately relate to
GZA’s life.

This focus on personal (but never boring
or sophistic) subjects in the work ofWus'l‘ang
and GZA is strongly influenced by the Five
Percenters, a splinter sect of the Nation of
islnm which preaches Black nationalism and
political consciousness, both of which color

much ofhisworlt.

other less traditional sources influence
GZA’s music as well, particularly martial arts
and chess. Liquid Swan/s opens with a scared
child’s rorce shaltrly telling the story ofhis the
ther taltcn from the l<ungan clr sic S/Iogl/ll
Arturrin. Throughout the album, antlro clips
from the movie introduc var-ions songs set-
ting a haunting rrrood ~ans or [ti/I Bill may

father was famous he was the sliogun’s de-
crrpitntor." The album corer of Liquid Sword:
incorporates lrrs love of chtss in a scene des
picting members of the Clan vanquishing
lesser crncecs.

GZA is an and chess player who once
claimed to have played 78 straight games
against another Wit-Tang member. He helped
found the website WuChess. which describes

a Wu-Tang member who produced most of
Liquid S'wm‘a'r, won the ﬁrst erer Kings Invi-
tational chess tournament hosted by the Hip’
Hop Chess Federation.

Priding himself on his various creative inc
fluences and sophisticated rhymes, GZA has
recently lamented the direction of contempt»
rary hrpshop. At the age of42. he has witnessed
basically the entirety of the genres evolution,
and at a performance in London last year, he
lashed out at rapper 50 Cent for his supposed
lack of lyrical ability. His recently released
track “Paper Plates" features barbs against the
50 Cent and other Top 40 performers, saying
they are, like the track's title, disposables
