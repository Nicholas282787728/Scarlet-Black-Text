the conversation, allowing
the professors to respond.
"What I just heard was deeply infuriating,"
said Ralph Savarese, English, one ofthe sign—
ers of last week’s letter to the editor. Savarese
defended the claims made in the letter, and
held up what he claimed was Andrews’ pert
sonucl file as evidence, “What was done to her
was outrageous Absolutely outrageous, and l
have a lot ofevidence" he said to loud applause
from thc students in attendance.

Faculty members involved in the creation
of the letter took offense at Dougharty‘s
characterization of account Andrews’ situa-
tion. “I expected that Mr, Doughtary would
say, believe, and perhaps even tightly claim
that authors of that letters did not know all
of the facts surrounding the teimination of
S. Andrews,“ wrote Iohnanna Meehan, Phi—
losophy, in an email to the seas,“w1iat l did
not expect Mr, Doughatry to do was to tell a
room packed with our students (about whom
we care deeply, and with many of whom we
have worked for many semesters) that the let
ter we wrote was “untruthful” and thus should
be viewed with suspicion."

“I believe that I, like faculty across the coin
lege regularly encourage and help foster the
ability to think critically that Mr. Daugherty
seems to think Grinnell students need to exer-
cise," Meehnn wrotet

The exchange between Doughatty and
Savarese at the end of the event was not the
only terse interaction between Dougharty and
a faculty member. Responding to student dis-
cussions on whether students should approach
the administration with problems individually
or collectively, Victoria Brown, History, en-
coumged students to create structures to en-
sure that their voices are heard.

“Don't be cowed into thinking that this is
all about your individual problems that can be
solved in individual offices, asking individual
questions, for which I hate to tell you, you will
sometimes not be told the truth," Brown said
“And if you’re not told the truth individually,
who can you check it out with?”

Dougharty responded at the event and de—
fended his, and the rest ofthe administration's,
interactions with the student body. “It saddens
me that that would be someones expectation
and I can guarantee people that that won't be
their experience with me," Dougharty said in
an interview after the forum. “And perhaps the
fact that that was said tells us or tells me about
the kind of community i joined. Because I
thought there was more trust and veracity here
than perhaps there is."

While most faculty attention at the forum
was directed at Dotlgharty, College President
Russell K. Osgood (who attended the begin-
ning of the event but left early) was given the
most blame for the situation by the faculty.

“Part of the problem here, everything gets
determined and imposed. It’s really, really fruse
trating. And the President states over and over
again that his judgment is better than ours,"
Savarcse said in an interview after the forum.
“What was done to Sheree Andrews is terrible,
and 1 really do ﬁnally hold the President re
sponsible, because he has been here for a long
time. And I told him and other people what
the impact would be, and it's a deep wound,”

Savarese said that he and other faculty
members had approached Osgood early in the
process after Andrews had been placed on ad-
ministrative leave. When asked if he felt their
complaints had been talten seriously, Savarese
said, “Not at all."

Osgood would not comment on any inter-
actions specifically related to Andrews' case.

But when asked how he views advice given by
faculty on general matters of student affairs,
Osgood said, “I listen to them very closely I

but when they come 1 do listen closely I hear
much more from sttidents than 1 do from fac-

again but it‘s not very frequent or often, but
when they come it's very useful."

plaints about how Andrews' situation was
handled, faculty members stressed that they
did not seek to discredit Dougharty or Dean
of Student Travis Greene, “1 want Houston
and Travis to be effective, but not at the east of
doing harm to others, or being able to use the
College's enormous resources to conceal what
I believe is their less than humane conduct,"
Savarese said, “And clearly I’m not alone."
