Changes and challenges as the College works to improve campus mental health

BY SAMIRA SADEQUES

Small liberal arts colleges are essentially a
recipe for mental illness and emotional dis-
tress; take 1500 young adults, remove them
from their homes, cram them onto small came
puses and subject them to extreme academic
and social pressures tintil everything comes to
a boil. Grinnell is not only a small school. but
a secluded, rural one, pulling Grinneilians at
especially high risk for mental health related
problems.

A study conductcd last semester by the
College's Mental Health Review Commit-
tee revealcd that within the academic year
2006-2007, 22 percent of Grinnell
students reported having been
diagnosed with depression,
compared with only is 8
percent of students at other
small colleges and 15.3 per;
cent nationally The study
also revealed that the number
of Grinnellians who reported
their academic performances be
ing impacted by various kinds of .
stress was higher than the average
number of students facing similar
problems in other small colleges or
national universities.

“Grinncll is a school with a rich
academic history, and thus tends to attract high
achieving people who have been successful
all their lives,” said Houston Dougharty, vice
president ofStudent Affairs. “Therefore, when
they find themselves in a pool ofsuch rigorous
competition, and skyrocketing expectations
from the professors, they get stressed out. It
takes time for them to settle into such an in-
tenscly academic environment and hence they
face stress related issues.”

To support students in coping wrth the
various stresses of college life, Grinnell Cole
lege Health Services offers free walkrin count
seling Monday through Friday, as well as the
opportunity for students to make regular ap-
pointments with one of the walk-in start, or
someone clsc from the Poweshiek County
Mental Health Center (PCMHC).

One of the main shortcomings of Grins
nell's mental health services, according to
some students, is that although they do offer
on campus counseling, all of the counselors
working in the College Health Center are
from the PCMHC. “The fact that there aren't
one or two psychiatrists on staff is pretty ri-
diculous to me," said Emma Lawler '09. “[We
need someone] for this campus, chosen by this

Food for theft:

iiv MANDO MoNTANo

Anyone who enjoys eating cereal from the
sturdy new dining hall bowls may owe their
thanks to every student who stole one of the
old ones. one of the reasons Dining services
has to periodically refurbish dining hall sup—
plies is, according to Dick Williams, head of
Dining Services, because items such as plates,
cups, and silverware “mysteriously go misss
in

g0fcourse,tostudents,DiningScrvicesem—
ployees. and Williams alike, the reason {or such
disappearances is far from a mystery. “i’ve been
in this business for a long time, and there’s al—
ways been theft of food, china, and silverware,"
Williams said, noting that the College actually
had to stop ordering monogrammed utensils
because their theft was so high.

Flatware is not the only victim of dining
hall theftismuggling food out ofthc dining
hall is a common practice, ranging anywhere
from an extra apple to a whole pie. “There was
one kid who tried to take a whole pumpkin
pie," said Karen Tedfotd, on»call cashier and
out-checker at the dining hall, “He saitl, ‘No
one is going to car it because i spat on it: and
when i told him he hatl to talk to Dick Wile

campus," she added, noting that she feels this
way, “Especially because of my lack of confir
deuce in the hospital here"

The report published by the Review Com-
mittcc highly recommended that the College
hire its own set of counselors, bur Grinnell’s
size has made this step somewhat difficult.
“Because we are a small college, to some extent,
we need to rely on the PCMHC,"Dougharty
said.

As a first step towards someday becoming
more selfesutiicient, the College hired Alecia
Sundsmo to act as a liaison between the Cole
lege and PCMHC. Sundsmo works with four

other counselors who work 47 hours a

week at the College Health Center.

“Alecia is here for emergency

walkeins and follow ups,” said-

l<arcn Cochran, director of

health services. According to

Cochran, one of the problems

the staff had with walkgin

appointments was that many

students came back for part

titular counselors and there

were sometimes long queues.

"There has been a great im-

provement in efficiency this

semester," Cochran said. “Since

Alecia joined us, there have not been

too many complaints,When the midesemester

exams were going on, we handled it really well
this time,”

By hiring sundsmo, the College has her
gun the process of improving the counseling
system on campus. “The College Counseling
is in transition to meeting the goals expected
from the Review Committee," said Sundsmo.
“My position is experimental; it is a part ofthls
transition. I am excited to see how far ahead
we go.”

Despite the improvement, there remain
some fundamental problems with campus
mental health services. Lawler was particularly
upset after an experience last year, when she
went to the PCMHC with a mental health isv
sue without notifying the College,but then [6'
turned to find that various College employees
were aware of her situation. “I had to make an
appointment with a higher up administrator
just to know who knew my information,which
I think is pretty inappropriate," Lawler said,
“Confidentiality is really important to mental
health, especially on a small campus."

Another key issue, as stated in the report, is
that "Many ofthe College’s current policies are
inadequate, not transparent, confusing narrow,

unclear and/or cumbersome In some cases it's
clear they have the potential to inhibit studcnts
from seeking mental health services.”

Lawlcr said she has often felt that she
has to prevent the College from becoming
involved with her mental health conceins. “I
don’t feel comfortable about how the College
gets involved With the students," she said,

because mental health is a sensitive subject,
helping students feeling comfortable and open
talking about it is key. Shivani Santoki'll said
that she would like it ifthere were a group of
students trained on campus to act as basic~lcve
e1 counselors. “When it is someone who is ofa
similar age, you feel much more comfortable,"
she said. “When it is workrrelatcd stress than
you know they are on the same boat as you are,
so you can relate much more to them."

New student group, Active Minds, has
potential to become a valuable asset in make
ing students feel more comfortable openly
discussing mental health issues, Chris Hildebr
rand ’10 and Paul Kramer'o9 started the group
last semester to help get rid of some or the
stigma surrounding mental illness, and to put
such issues out in the open for students to dis-
cuss. Group members said that the group has
been receiving very positive responses, “The
fact that many people show up for the group
meetings, makes me feel optimistic about it,”
Hildebrand said,

Active Minds is affiliated with a nationr
wide mental health organization by the samc
name that focuses on clearing the social stigma
that mental illness is a weaknessThe organi-
zation finances projects and advertisements in
different colleges and universities across the
country.

Earlier this year the campus group distribe
iited depression screenings and information
about depression awareness, and a few weeks
ago they screened the film Girl, Interrupted,
about a woman who attempts suicide and is
sent to a female mental institution. They said
they would also be more than willing to orgar
nize any needed support groups. “1 know there
was an eating disorder support group on cam
pns," said Hildebrand. “If we still want more
peer support groups we can always work that
out."

Hopefully student participation in Active
Minds and interest in campus mental health
will continue since, as Lawler pointed out, stu-
dent input is key in helping the College meet
student mental health needs. “I would like to
scc a much higher rate of constructive critir
cism by students."

dining hall stealing makes dining staff sick

liams, there were five girls at the door claiming
he was bringing the pie to them."

students also have more covert ways of
smuggling food outside the dining hall. Ac
cording to Kelly Edgington, dining hall superr
visor, there is a girl who brings zip lock bags
in her purse and takes out large quantities of
food,and most students make a habit ofsmtf-
ing extra pieces of fruit into their pockets or
hoods.

While smuggling out food is a common
practice, the d' 'gn hall does try to control it
and Williams saidg that he wants students to
understand that it has consequences. “[The
students] are not stealing from the dining hall
they're stealing from their fellow students,"
Williams said.

Williams explained that the food prepara-
tion is a heavily monitored process in which
they order and prepare a certain amount of
food based on how many students are on the
meal plan. When students take extra food, the
amount of food made for each meal has to be
increased, causing Dining Services to increase
the price for meals as well. “You're paying for
that, it isn't Dick Williams,”Williams said.

“Some students don't consider it stealing

because they ‘paid’ for it, but that’s just ratios
millzatlon in my opinion,"

Dining Services is also concerned about
their liability if students should fall ill from
consuming Dining services food outside the
dining hall. “I'm more worried about them
taking something out and then getting sick,"
said Rita Vogcl, dining hall supervisor.

Vogel explains that some of the foodispee
cirically meats and perishable itemsineed to
be at a cold temperature in order to stay fresh,
and ifa student carries around the food all day
without refrigeration they could get sick. “You
could get really sick and it’s not going to be our
fault because we didn’t do it, the student is the
one who took it out," Vogel said.

Students like Alex McConnell '12, dis-
agreed with Vogel's fear of food home illness.
“I don't see there being an outbreak ofmcat
related diseases on campus—people aren't get—
ting e coli, gangrene, or having alien babies, I’m
notworried, McConnell said Why shouldnt
1 take the food out from my plate.> They to just
going to throw it away anyways.

Some stun
dents said
they take

extra food out ofthe dining hall because they
feel the food in the Grille or in town is too
expensive. Ariana Barusch ’11 said she main»
1y takes out fruits and smaller items. “I don’t
make a big effort to hide it because 1 think
it’s something I shouldn't have to hide," Bat-
uscll said. “Give me more freedom not to steal
something from the dining hall, but to instead
transfer my imeatcn meal and outtake to grab
something at the Grille."

Even though there is annoyance on both
sides of the dining hall smuggling debate,Ted-
ford wants to reassure students that the dining
hall employees only want whats best for the
students. “We want the students to be happy
and our first priority is to feed them and make
sure they're eating well. We’d hate it
if anything bad happened to
them because
of the
food,"
