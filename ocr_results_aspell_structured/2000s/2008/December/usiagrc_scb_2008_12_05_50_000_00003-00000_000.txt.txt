VVhlle the pub has decreased its deﬁcit
from last year, it is still experiencing ﬁnancial
dilliculties.

According to the most 1ccent financial
statement, Lylcs Pub was operating at a loss
of 52862. 30 and alcohol sales comprised 70. 5
percent oftotal sales .

Aside from revenue concerns, one of the
biggest challenges, which continues to press
pub rnanagemenr,rs the city sales ratio l'equile-
meut, which states that a pub or restaurants
revenue must cornc from at least so per-cent
nousalcohol s. , in order to allow access to
people under 21.

Lyle's Manager Drake Ballcw '09 believes
that the most recent ﬁnancial statement is not
representative of Lylc's pel'fo mancc this st:~
mester and remains optimistic that Lyle‘s will
conrirrne to implove,

"Ifwe sold all the beer on the shelves and
cleaied out the refrigel‘iltorsiilll of that it re
tail price—then we would break even, which
is a signiﬁcant improvement flom an $11,000
less for one semester," Ballew sa1d.“l imagine
that next semester it will be a profitable busr
ness."

While the current rate of non-alcohol sales
at 29.5 percent is well below the threshold, the
city is willing to work with the College, Dean
ofstudents Travis Greenc,who is the pub fac-
ulry supervisor, wrote in an email to the seals.

"There is no hardrfast date as to when we
have to be an 5050. Being a newer establish»
ment, I believe they will be flexible." Greene
wrote. “I am not certain as to the timeline of
implementing the consequences ifwe do not
meet the 50—50 mark."

According to Lyle’s coeMannger Susan
Klumpner’09, the pub has cut down on hours
and reduced the number of workers per shift
in an effort to reduce overhead costs. “Wages
was one of the places where we lost the most
money last semester," Klumpner said. “We

Andrews done national searches,

"am It. 1 but it's important to do so
in order to ﬁnd the best candidates."

Dougharry pointed to it general desire
for increased professionalism within the
Student Affairs ofﬁce as a motivation for
the enhanced requirements.

Some, however, have said the require»
ments are excessive. Osgood, for instance,
said he recommended the inital job posting
have the requirement of doctoral work be
removed, so as to not limit the application
pool.

In addition, the 2008 vacancy for the
Dean of Students position, currently occuv
pied by the recently hired Travis Greene, re-
quired seven years total experience but only
four years post-master's, though the Dean
of Students oversees the Assistant/Associ-
ate Dean position,

“For the [AssistandAssociate Dean po-
sition], we want someone with considerable
postvmaster’s experience," Dougharty said.
“And part of the reason is that this will be
someone who’s going to be responsible for
residence life and orientation.” He said he
hoped the new hire has experience in both
areas.

The search will be conducted by Greener
According to Greene, he has begun to as—
semble a search team that will include three
students and three staff members.

Within a week of posting, Student Af-
fairs has already received a number of in-
quires. Dougharty said he ected 50 to
100 applicants. Dougharty sai that there is
no deadline for applications to the position
and that the listings will remain open-until
the position is ﬁlled, which he expects to
happen sometime next semester.

a special event.”

To increase non-alcohol, revenue the pub
managers have hosted special events in which
college organizations purchase food for par—
ticipants. In an event hosted earlier in the se-
mester to promote responsible drinking, Stu-
dent Affairs paid for food while students were
allowed to purchase only one alcoholic drink
an hour. At that event, the pub earned $800 in
sales with 3620 coming from food and non-
alcoholic drink sales.

According to Greene, the special events.

Pub slowly climbing out of fiscal hole

Lyle 3 Pub attempts to meet City legal requirements while attracting crowds and turning a profit

use the pub who might otherwise not use rhe
pub or know about it,"Greene said.

According to Ballew, Lyle’s continues to
face competition from other events on campus
where alcohol consumption is not regulated
and students are not lequlred to spend their
own money.

“One of the major challenges of rrrnning
a bar on a college campus is that you're com-
peting against essentially free beer and a little
more than half of our customer base is under
age, so they cant really enjoy the establishment
to the full extent," Ballew sa1d.

Students interviewed, such as Marianne
OlneyrHamel '11, conﬁrmed Ballew’s state-
ment. “IfI were 21 I would go to the pub,"
she said.

“W: Va tiled to transform the Pub into an
infoimal venue and promote interest among
students and make it more social, which is why
we‘ve added new attractions," Klumpner said.

New entertainment attractions such as two
dartboards, an iTunes jukebox, a foosball table
and a counter electronic game were added this
semester in an attempt to attract more stu-
dents

As Lyle’s managers pursue new initiatives
to improve the pubs ﬁnancial status and com-
pliance with the 50-50 ordinance, expectations
remain high. "We expected some sort of loss.
I can only see our financial situation getting
better," Klumpncr said.

College whole things just shady ...1

"0'" P' I deﬁnitely don't trust them."

The one question aboutwhich Grinnellidns
most agreed also conﬁrmed Grinnell's stanls as
a top liberal arts rnstiturion. Over 90 percent
of students said that they “learn a lot in class"
compared to only ﬁve pelcent who disagreed,
Seventyescvcn percent of respondents agreed
that “time at Grinnell prepares [them] for the
future."

Students were split on their workload, with
30 percent agreeing that "Grinnell has an un-
reasonably henvy worldoad" compared to 31
percent disagreeing, There was some correla-
tion between students’ opinions about their
education and their class workloadThose who
said they learn a lot in class were nearly 40 pere
cent more likely to agree that “Grinnell has an
unreasonably heavy workload" than those who
said they don’t learn a lot.

“The workload can be pretty enormous,but
when you have a professor who you can work
with I haven’t had a problem," Becca Macken-
lie ’09 wrote in a survey “1 don't mind doing
a lot ofwork for a professor who respecrs me
and the work I put in—I have problems doing
work for a professor who doesn't.”

Some students, such as Will Flagle '09,
wrote that a somewhat less demanding curric—
ulum might, in fact, increase student learning.
“I think I would learn more with less work,”
he wrote,

“There is a substantial difference between
reading 30 pages thoroughly and 60 pages
quickly to get the main ideas" Flaglc wrote.
“The latter provides a few, very generalized
statements that are quickly forgotten."

Despite the praise for Grinnell’s academic
environment, a minority ofstudentsill perr
cent—saw signiﬁcant room for improvement
in the breadth and depth of the school’s cure
riculum. While many students acknowledged
that the Couege’s size presents certain limita—
tions. many said they would like to see more
classes in certain ﬁelds.

Among the topics mentioned were pho-
tography, architecture, journalism, engineering,
and creative writing. There was also a srrong
desire among students to move away from an
apparent eurcrcentrism in many disciplines
and include more studies speciﬁcally about
Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

While somewhat less favorable toward
the administration, students were quite fond

of themselves. over so percent had a posi-
tive view ofthe student body, and 70 percent
thought that sclfrgovernance was an effective
policy, and thar students actively promoted
social justice on campus.

Not all students were well received, how»
ever. The Student Government Association
(SGA) received the lowest marks ofany earns
pus institution, student or administration.
only 23 percent of respondents agreed that
“SGA enacts signiﬁcant change,“ compared
to 23 percent who disagreed. Nearly half of
the respondents were “neutral" on the group,
with many expressing ignorance about SGA’s
rcsponsibiliries and activities on campus.

Jakob Gowell ’11 wrote that he thought of
SGA as “primarily an organization that prof .
vides services such as movies and concerts to
students."

or respondents, a whopping percent 63
percent agreed that "the seal; adequately re-
ports on important issues" and a mere 61 per-
cent thought that“the 865 is funny.”

Treasurer

from p. 1 formed by Witthaus’s ace
cepmncc ofthe nomination.
“I think he’ll make a great treasurer," she sai
"rm really happy he decided to step up, be
cause I wouldn’t have left if I hadn’t known
someone could do the job well."

SGA President Neo Morake ‘09 said that
Witthaus had stood out during the job search
last spring and was the ﬁrst person approached
to serve as a replacement.“ltwas an easy choice
in rhat he was a very close runner- up when we
were looking for an assistant treasurer," Mor-
akc said.

The assistant treasurer usually has a year
to train and learn the insrandrouts of the po-
sition. Normally, the assistant treasurer be-
gins to take over early second semester. The
assistant starts to lead Student Programming
Committee meetings and gains access to the
SGA checkbook. During this transition, the
treasurer serves more and more as a consultant
as the assistant grapples With new bureaucratic
challenges.

Wirrlraus and Wax will pack the treasurer
training into a single semester. Witthaus wrll
begin his duties at the end ofthis semester.

“I'm really looking forward to working
with cabinet next semester," Witthaus sa
“I’ve always thought that SGA was an im-
peltant part of campus. and I'm excited to get
more involved, especially because [accounting]
is something i like."

Despite the timectunch, Wax said she is
optimistic about Witthaus’s training. “Cyrus
has been a member of the student Programs
ming Committee for two years and is currently
a senator," she said. “We’re conﬁdent he will be
capable oflearning quickly.“
