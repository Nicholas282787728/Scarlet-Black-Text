Things we want to see: longer break, fewer cuts
Concerned about cuts

To the Budget steering Committee:
We are all aware that in light ofthe recessionyou

Staff Editorial. .

are rerassessing how the College
uses and distributes its funds And
since it is the holiday season and all.
we have a few choice items we'd like
to put on our budgetary wish list.

Professors. Grinnell is first and
foremost an educational instinrtion,
and as such, our need for professors is pretty Cleal.
The College will be deciding whethcr or not to make
faculty hires—either as replacements or as part of
the Expanding Knowledge Initiative. We think that
such hiring is a worthwhile investment and should be
prioritized, even ifthat ineans spending more ofthe
endowment.

Griuiicll prides itself in having a high Faculty
student ratio. And for good reason More faculty ale
low for smaller class sizes whele students receive lli’
dividualizcd attention and more thoughtful fccdhack.
Further, the large ﬁrstrycilr class adds urgency to the
need for an increase in dietary size to maintain small
class sizes.

Financial aid. We love that Grinnell is one of the
few institutions to meet the demonstrated financial

needs of all donlest students. From our conversa-
tions with Vice President of Institutional Planning
and Associate Dean Marci Sotror and from pICSldCHI
Russell K. Osgood’s recent letter, we believe tha| this
is not in danger orchanging.
But, we want to reinforce the
fact that ﬁnancial aid is the
only reason many of us are
able to be here. Opportunity
for aid attracts students who
both desire and deserve to
come to Grinnell but might not orherwrsc consider
applying. This will become especially true as recession
continues and need increases.

We agree that we should hold off on starting
large projectsisuch as building a new braryiand
tl‘i'lt indivi ual budgets should he scril .t,(l. Fur-
ther, we as students must assess our own budgetary
lequests, Cutting out the small luxuries will help free
up money for essentials. While we do not think the
student activity fee—the funding _ ur-ce orscra and
SPARCmshould be reduced, we should think twice
before making demands ofthosc resources.

We understand that having a huge endowment
does not mean we can go on a spending frenzy; and
that Griniicll is in a bettel position than other eolr
leges, Eeloit has cut 34 jobs, including adjunct faculty

and many colleges have hiring or- travel lrt. ts,

Even so, the College does have a huge endow
merit, and what good is it ifwc cannot use it in times
like these,Vl/c can spend more ofit within reason. Est
peeially if that means the College is hiring premium
faculty and helping outstanding but needful students
fund their education,

so as you consider endowment spending lind bud-
get cuts, please lcave money for new professors and
continue your support for ﬁnancial aid,

We’ll leave you milk and cookies,

Call for extended break

once ngarn,1owu weather turned nasty in the days
surrounding Thanksgiving Break. and once again,
students attempted to beat time by rushing back and
forth from school to home in the span offnul days
Tile presence or classes on the prchhanksgivlng
VVednesdl , has proved both annoying and potentially
dangerous, Classes the day before Thanksgiving are
vexing on their own, but, more importantly, crunched
time brings fast driving, and last driving brings accir
dents. By extending the break to ﬁve days, the school
would relieve much ofthe travel stress that often leads
to dangerous driving, It only taltcs one day to avoid
this potenrrally unsafe situation

Stop using oil and you solve all of our problems

To all you kids with “world peace" at the top of
your Christmas lists this holiday season, sorry, Santa
can‘t help.

But America can.

No, seriously. America consumes over 20 million
barrels ofoil a day. That's more than a quarter ofworld
oil consumption. A signiﬁcant decrease in American
demand for all would remove
major distortions in our for- 7
sign policy, restore consistenr '
cy to our human rights and
democracy promotion efforts,
and starve hostile regimes of
the resources they rely on to
promote conﬂict.

A list ofthe top-ten coun-
tries with the largest ell reserves is a who's who of
the world's worst regimes. On the list you'll find the
following notables: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela.
Russra, Nigeria, and Libya. These countries have an
average Freedom House rating ore and 5 in polrneal
rights and civrl liberties, 7 being the worst,

When politicians tell you that the money you
spend on gasoline pads the pockets ofnefarious gow
ernments, it's one of the few rirncs that they aren't
lying.

Take Saudi Arabia for example: The Saudi Royal
family collects more than a billion dollars a day in
oil revenues, using them to pay on a vast network of
inﬂuential supporters, enrich themselves, and fund
radical extremist movements. Because Saudi Arabia's
30 million people don’t pay a penny of income mx,
the royal family doesn't respond to their demands for
democracy, human rights, or legitimate government.
Thirty million people without rights and no avenues
for reform— that sucks.

But what sucks even harder is what the Saudis
have done with the money you and 1 have sent them.
The monarchy has spent billions ofdollars on institu-

need to change now.

Baratk and Congress need to use this cr' ' as an
opportunity to pass sweeping reform on this issue.
We‘ve heard a lot about Washington creating “Green
Collar johs"aud the timing is just righr to see it hap-
pen. A lot offolks think that the government needs
to spend less to make up for the bailout, but the op-
posite needs to happen. Almost all economists agree
that the only way we can pull out of this depression
is through unprecedented levels of deﬁcit spending.
Barack’s got close to a blank check to kick-Start the
economy:

Why not spend the money on subsidies for alr
tetnativc energyr tax breaks for utilities that commit
resources to lenewable forms, and copious amounts of
funding for research and development? With the auto
industry back at the trough begging for public funds,
Congless needs to increase fuel standards dramath
cally and demand a transition to electric cars.

America can dramatically decrease the influence
of these troublesome regimes by leading the rest of
the world rowards renewable energy production.
Though I’ve sang the praises of altruistic American
foreign policies in past columns, our dependence on
foreign oil has often drstorted the message of tree»
dam and democracy into one of hypocrisy and Con»

diminished. But an Antcticaiieled revolution in en-
ergy can return us to our leadership role in the world
and signiﬁcantly decrease the ability of countries to
oppress their citizens and cause havoc for the rest of
us. Reducing demand for oil is the closest thing to a
panacea for “world peace".

In the meantime, drive a hrrless, recycle youtplasr
