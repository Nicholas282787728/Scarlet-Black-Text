And the controversy of the week is . . curling?

Our heroes return to weigh in on the dynamic, fairly new Olympic sport that’s on the minds of the nation

There aren't many Olympic sports that
turn my stomach—I consider myself tolerant
enough to enjoy such Mudblood sports such
as table tennis and badminton. But sometimes,
such as in the case ofcurling, a sport steps too
far over the line to warrant.

Recently 1 was informed by the “Balance"
part or this duo that he was planning to write
about the “stunningly beautiful" sport or citri-
mg. I am no stranger to the eliche' Orcllrllligi
paid sports columnists and analysts, who are the
ultimate abusers of clichés, by law use curling
as a comparison to rotirrhour baseball games or
lowtsmring football gamcs,

supposedly, it is a boring sport. supposedly.
old people play it, supposedly, no one's ever been
knocked unconscious, purposehrlly or deit-
tally, in a game of curling. The embodiment of
all things stereotypicaily Canadian, Americans.
such as myself, love to poke run at it.

But while I enjoyed grouping curling with
ﬁshing, playing checkers outside of Cracker
Barrel and the Lifetime channel, my conscience
bothered met could not ignorantly pass such
harsh public judgment on such a revered sport,
If] mocked curling, which holds a deep root
in the history of really cold places, would my
words border on Midwesterner xenophobia?

Thus, I decided to look into the sport.The
Wikipedia page was my first stop, and i read
three lines and stopped. it was described as
“chess on ice." Curling, a game in the Winter

Olympics, compared to a game ofchess? is it
really worth it to steal rink time from exhila-
rating events, such as speed skating or women’s
hockey, to watch middle-aged office workers
play “chess on ice?”

Believe me, the description is correct. Search
it on YouTube, read a netvspaperrecap,try to dif-
ferentiate between a bowler and a curler. Don't
get me wrongAl'iu sure id love the sport. 1 also
enjoy tiddlywinks and Blidge, both or which
seem as appropriate for
the Winter Olympics as
curling.

What I propose is
that we remove curling
from the Winter Olym»

Let’s face facts; everyone knows who is got
mg to wrn the ice skating competition every
year. And other ncvvlyeadded Olympic sports
such as snowboarding are nothing more than
a way for America to show off.

Then there are thc true Olympic sports, in
which athletes compete for love or the sport,

or any curling team for that matter.

For curlers, all that stands iii the way or
disastrous mishap is a curler and a broom,
Such IS the reality of the most pure sport in
the Olympics. Curling goes back to the grand
ole'days orlate Medieval Scotland, predating
baseball, football and even the much gloriﬁed
ice hockey.

The original masters otrhe ice took rrorhe
ing for granted as they reached into their
kitchen closetsr picked up that broom and
headed for the frozen depths of the nearest
lake or pond.
