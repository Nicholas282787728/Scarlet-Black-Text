N0 toner, the tip of the berg just one simple question, d-hall Latin American angst, oh no

Where's the tuner? The women it the prison
were up in arms over not having a reading assign-
ment tonight, andI blame U, SGA copy machine,
and U, voicebox copy machine. What's rhc point
ofa copy machine that cant make copies; Where
is your pride, your dignity? Why don't you just
throw yourself out ofone oftllose huge JRC win-
dows into the abyss? Whatevs, you] got a leer
turn from one ofthe ladies in Mitchellviile about
being stripped oi'all material possessions. Dudc.
Vth is wrong with our country? Not only is
there no toner, these women have state-issued
bras tor petc‘s sake: Where is the justice in rhut
USA?! And likc,why docs our country have the
highest rate of incarceration in the world (1% of
the adult population is in prison)? And the rate
of incarceration of women is rising. Why can't
some prisoners vote? America, land of the free,
you break my heart.

WHERE THE

‘ROMAN BURGERS

~1er Willin- '10

Ok, so big up to everyone that came to the Latin
American Ensemble concert this past weekend.
Unfortunately, next year, our practice time has been
cut IN HALF. I know. How atrocious, right? How
dnre the music depnrrmenr think our music can be
runs to by n lnuul of 5+ tlnd n group of singers
Closing in on the double 'gits in roughly 2 hours
of practice, once r friggin’ week! That's just “kick.
Not to mention other groups have been “complain-
ing" about non-Latin Jazz music being plnycd in the
Early Modern Music Room in Bucksbaum. Why do
you gotta hate on our jammin’? Is it that horrible
when we use that room for interdisciplinary musical
purposes? I thought all you dudes in the Academy
are all over that? Anywlio, I mostly want to com»
plain that, while adding a full time Jazz Prof with
full time Jazz band hours is sweet, the Latin Ameri-
can Ensemble is getting the short end of the stick.
NOT cool. Minus two.
