Well serving it every time with

but serving the same entrees and sides

For one thing, serving the same
foods together drills the palate.

Repetition is always boring, even

Addressing “binge” drinking at Grinnell college

Danny Haupt ’08 questions the validity of current definitions of binge drinking on and off our campus

As an individudl who picked up the nickname
“Double Fistirigmaruiy his ﬁrst year in collcgc,l reel
1 have at least some perspective on college drinking
culture. But when I look lit it number of news articles
that cover the SiibJCCi’ or pamphlets on campus that
attempt to inform students about alcohol abuse,1find
myselrtroubled.

The binge drinking pamphlet available in the
health center deﬁnes binge drinking as the consump-
tion of ﬁve or more drinks in a row in a two-week
periodThc ambiguity and broad nature orthc criteria
means peoplc without serious drinking problcrns are
included.

The large and supposedly increasrng number of
binge drinking ~tiitltnis have lurid l“r\i\\’ tti tall lbi' dry
campus polities across the country.

I believe the term binge drinking and the tone
servatwe attitudes toward college alcohol policies are
trvely impede el‘l‘orrs to challenge
students about their drinking hab-
its by protecting them instead ol’
crigngiug them. Apparently, I'm
not altinc.
