LIVE JAZZ OUTSIDE OF THE IRC: There is nothing more
refreshing than smooth jazz, swing dancing, a summer
breeze and the glow of the Joe Rosenfield Center at night,

 

 

 

GCCF PANCAKES: Free pancakes are one of the best things

, in the world. It is too bad Grinnellians are so busy that

they have to stay up until 3 arm to eat them,

 

 

 

SMOKING BAN: It was bad enough when smoking was
resticled to specific areas on campus, but with the new
ban in effect, there Is nowhere for students to smoke.

 

 

Students speak
about what's on
their minds in 142
words or fewer,
and you’re invited!
If you have a rant,
e-mail it to
[hortonmo]. Com-
plaining in a public

more fun than do-

Conjoined twins: why
two brains are better

For those oryou not lucky enough to have a palace single in Norris, be consid
eiate ot’youi roommate. I know, I know, you two get along great. You visited hcr/
his poems at Christmas, even though you're Jewish. 1 get it, you’ie not just room»
malaiymllm soul mates. But that doesn‘t excuse the fact that you sometimes send
your mate hate rays in his/her gentleness sleep, and that you secietly resent them
for their stench/superior social skills (depending on which half or the odd couple
you are).

Now imagine him/her tagging along when you go home, And to the grocery
store, And to the bathroom. You've entered the life of conjoined twins, of whom
theic are many happy and healthy scrs throughout rhc world. One such set, with
separate bmins (and personalities) but a shared torso lives in my native Minnesota,
whercrlespite the hot that each twin contiols one leg and one arm they are quite
ittobiltﬂiarticulrirlyv since they recently got their joint diivet's license.

Another pair of conjoined twins,Brlts this time, who were born conjoined at the
head 18 months ago, are thriving nicely, Like all conjoined twins, they are unique
people, and their mother explained (probably with a hilarious accent. . .takt that, Rik
chel Fields!) that her
girls have ro- rally differs
entpcrsonal- ities, Their
heads just happen to
be “Zippered” together.

Now, try not to get
too excited about this
next fact: theic is a
little bit orbrain stuck in the zipper, The twins have a “biidge”ofbruin tissue cone
netting than, leaving room for the possibility that they may be able to transmit
thoughts betwccn themselves.

How's that for an invasion or privacy?

The loci of connection, and arguably coolness, decreases from conjoined, to
identical, to fraternal twins, and is downright boring between regular ol’ siblings.

While everyone knows that even identical twins have different personality traits,
new research shows that they have genetic differences too.

Identical twins have the same DNA, but environmental differences can affect
which genes are switchcd on or otr, called cpigenctic modiﬁcation. A study of 80
pairs ortwins aged 3 to 74 showed that soeycareold twins had 3 times the number
otinodit‘ications as Seyeareolds, with especially Luge dirt'crences between twins who
had spent most otthcir Lives apart.

Even if they are separated at birth, all twins are, obviously, together in uteio.
Another study on twins showed giils with tiaternal twin biorheis, who me no rnoie
genetically ieli d to each othei than regulai siblings, ate impacted by the sex of
then “wombrniate.”

Girls with fraternal twin brothels are more likely to be “miinnish” in ii variety
otwait, including being aggicsswc, adventurous, and prone to road rage. This is
be c they are taking testosterone intravenously All (crusts start out gcndcricss,

Moreover, I’d make a leriible conjoined twin I’m really clumsy, but it' nothing else,

Don’t forget your laundry!!!

...Wait a second. Let me get this su‘uighl:
every member or the Grinnell symphony or»
chestra worked our tails off putting together a
performance or Britteit’s Wot Root/ion, a coir
cert which conﬂicted with Titular Head, and
this is how the 5&3 headlined the review of
the concert: “Grinnell Singers, other perform

Mir Regux‘mi"? EXCUSE MEN? Was our labor;

less important than the Grinnell Singers??? Are
we less of a Gtinncll institution (How about
the Grinnell Community Chorus ?) We all

worked our gully dang tails off, and all we get is

that indignant lunip with “others."I ,. am.” 50;.“

8th Avenue between the IRC and Noyce is both
the busiest and ugliest pail of campus. 8th Avenue
needs to be removed and the empty s ice ﬁlled with
plants, sculpture and places to sit. Hopefully the en,
downitnt could provide tor a giant Grinnell Pioneer
centerpiece fountain t . . but I would be satisﬁed with
a little green.

5&8 on the Web

Please stop leaving laundry in the machines for
ridiculous amounts of time. When I gut there we
day, there weis already six wet piles, and when i was
done drying two hours later. they were still there, .
slowl , getting colder and harder like Downy-ﬂa-
vored Jellro. Maybe ifit happens again I'lljust steal
your clothes, how about that? Or maybe I'll just
dump them all in a pile on the ﬂoor and mix them
up. You could have a sweet little moment with the
guy from down the hall, disentanghng your lacy
underwear from his gym socks, bonding over how
inconsiderate you both are, And when you become
two of the 98% of Grinnellians who marry each
other and he turns out to be kind ofajeik, who'll be
laughing then? I will, because you should’vc taken
your laundry out on time
