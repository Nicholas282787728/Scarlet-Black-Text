Celebrities, finance, initiatives

Not getting punk’d

We've heard a lot of criticism about the
llumber ofGrinnellians who showed up to see
Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore last Friday
afternoon, especially in light of the fact that
their appearance was one of the most attends
ed events ever in the lRC. However, it would
be unfair to generalize about the interests of
our campus based on this one event.

Yes, a good portion of campus showed
up to the rally— a member of the Campus
Democrats estimated between a quarter and a
third otcampos— but a good portion ofcamr
pus also voted on Wednesday with a knowlr
edge and a reasoning behind their choices
that was not borne simply from seeing some
celebrities endorse a particular candidate.

During the Ohama-McCain debate
Friday night, most of
the lounges on campus
were packed with sni»
dents trying to learn
the candidates‘ posi-
tions on important is»
sues. The amount of
interest in the debate
is highlighted by the
fact that it took place
on a Friday night, and that there was no lack
of debauchery to take part in. Students who
watched the debate could easily have spent
that time gerﬁng‘drunk, but instead they
were enriching their awareness of everyday
concerns in order to make an enlightened po-
litical choice.

Giving up a Friday evening to watch
a couple of senators actually talk about the
issues ofthis election shows a bit more devo-
tion than stopping by JRC 101 on your way
out oflunch to snap a shot ofa couple ofce-
lebtities. We’re proud to be part ofa student
body that can make their own decisions in-
stead of letting Hollywood decide.

Financial crisis info Voting for initiatives

It’s always good to know that the college
has students covered when crisis strikes.

Last Monday, in an event sponsored by
the Rosenf‘ield Committee, students packed
the Forum to hear four
professors discuss the
current ﬁnancial crisis
and answer student ques-
tions. The event was a

the faculty and adminis—

tration should respond to

student needs: as quickly as possible but with
attention to the details that make such events
work.

These sorts of events should happen more
often.

Each profesr
sor had distinct
views on the
crisis and separ
rate approaches
to analyzing it.
These differ
ent viewpoints
allowed more
students to par
ticipate than just ones studying ﬁnance and
economics to have a chance at understanding
the nature ofthe crisisThe event didn’t start
to empty out until about an hour in and the
professors' s eeches seemed to be well (or at
least quietly received.

The ﬁnancial crisis forces us to think out
side the Griunell bubble, and the response so
far from the administration and the faculty
has indicated that they will make every effort
to help us do so. We might not be able to air
fact any real change, given the scope of the
issues, but we should at least understand the
world we will be moving into soon enough.

”Students who watched the
debate could easily have spent
perfect example of how that time getting drunk...”

At first glance, most ofus were happy with
the initiative results. All but one passed, and
we love bikes, Freesound and apple slicers as
much as the next Grinnellian. But a second
look at the results showed a
disturbing detail.

In this election, Election
Board opted to count “no
preference" votes, as votes in
favor of the initiative (see or
ticle, p. 1).

Students have had the “no
preference” o tion since at least Spring 2006.
We can’t no or sure why the option was first
created, but one clear advantage is that it apt
pears to have boosted voter turnout. A stu-
dent can opt “no preference" instead of not
voting at all, which ultimately increases the
ballot count. This is clearly advantageous in
a process which demands at least 50 percent
student turnout to be valid.

But interpreting “no preference” as “in
favor" clearly subverts even the most basic
reading of the bylaws which state that, “Each
in ative proposal must be approved by two-
thirds of the students voting." Common sense
dictates that “no preference" does not trans-
late to “approve."

There are other options. lelection Board
cannot muster votes with e—mails then it
should table and poster name. And ifstudents
simply refuse to vote, then perhaps the initia-
tive doesn’t warrant passage in the first place.
If the campus believes that initiatives should
be valid regardless of vote torals. then so be
ltiilmend the bylaws.

But simply adopting new electoral proce-
dures to accommodate student apathy is both
inappropriate and slid. If we can’t take time
to advocate for apple slicers on our own, then
maybe we don't deserve them.

Democracy promotion: a liberal obligation

Junayd Mahmoud ‘09 explains why democratic errors shouldn’t be a reason to discard democracy

Democracy promotion has garnered nu
merous negative connotations as the foreign
policies ofrhe Bush administration have end»
cd in abysmal failure.

When the intrial pretext for preemptive
war in Iraq proved to be false and Mills
were nowhere
to be found, the
“freedom agenda"
argument was den
played to justin

disorder of the Bush Doctrine for decades.
That's why its rehabilitation must begin anew
with humility in action but not compromise
in principlc.Thc future of liberal democracy
demands it,

Around the world and even in America,
there's a palpable lack of confidence in the
liberal democratic ideal.

Americans feel increasingly helpless dcr
spite all of our liberties and advantages. Our
leaders are failing us. it's easy to see why we'rc
dissatisfied. our economy is rcctcring on thc
edge of an abyss, our military rs deployed m
two foreign wars we want nothing to do With,
and the vast majority ofus know our nation is
on the wrong track.

Though no one is scrlollsly arguing an al—
ternative to democracy at home, we're Ios g
the moral clallty that pushed FDR to defend
democracy - inst fascism and tnspllcd Tru-
mnn to deploy it against communism.

But the moral cliulty that framed our
unapologetic pursuit of democratization

shouldn’t disappear because we’ve made mis-
takes. Many cite our appalling treatment of
detainees, support for authoritarian regimes,
and the 2000 election fiasco as undermining
our own argument for democratization.
These criticisms are valid and demand
serious intro-
spection into the
state of affairs
here at holue.
But they do
nothing to di-
lute the compel-
ling argumcnr of

liberal democracy.

The mistakes we make in the processes
of governance dont reflect the weaknesses of
democracy, but the fallibility intrinsic to hu-
mankind. Winston Churchill reﬂected that
democracy “is the worst form of government
except for all those other forms that have
been tried."
