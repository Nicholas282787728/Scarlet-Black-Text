Symposium to highlight 1968

Activists and scholars remember the year of llglobal revolution”

in ALlsnA MEHTA

In 1968, turbulent tilnes combined with a new generation
ofdl'iven youth to give birth to a global revolution. Forty years
later, many or those who experienced the year orriots. protests
and change will share their stories in Grinnell College.

“1958: The Global Revolution,” a
symposium sponsored by the Center for
International Studies and various other
programs and departments, begins next
Monday, and will commemorate the
40th anniversary of widespread student
protest and reform movements acloss
the globwfrom Grinnell to Prague to
Mexico City.

In planning the symposium, organiz-
eis sought to bring a range of speakers
that would reﬂect the movement’s geo-
graphic and intellectual diversity. “We
ti ied to bring together a panel of speakers
that could provide both an intimate rec-
Ollection of the events of1968 and also
eclectic perspectives on the events," said
symposium organizer David Harrison,
French.

The symposium features eight speake
ers, many of who participated in that
year's protests. Alain Geismar, one orthe
speakers, led the general strike in Paris that nearly toppled the
de Gaulle regime. Geismar will present a talk Monday at s p.m.
titled “A Very French May 68," about his experiences in Paris
that month.

According to Rob Lewis, History, speakers will discuss
how the ideas propelling the ’53 revolution still have relevance
today. ”What’s remarkable about [1968] is that it unleashed a

new realm ofpuliticsihuman rights, sexuality, gay and lesbian
rights, environmental issues,” he said.

Karla lay, a leading ﬁgule in both the women's liberation
and gay and lesbian movements, has focused on how the events
0(1968 inﬂuenced her activism. jay will talk about the Co-

lumbia student uprisings on Thursday at
4:15 p.m.

Harrison stressed the global nature
ufthe events of 1968.“When Americans
think of1968 they focus predominantly
on American issues, but this was a year of
overwhelming importance from a global
perspective," Harrison said, “This syme
posium aims to remind and teach people
about the global signiﬁcance orthis year
and how it shapes today’s polities and 50*

le [/1111 Rotkld [be War/r1 as well as Still.-
A World Hit/Dry, will present “The Cause
of the Global Combustion of 1968” as
the convocation speaker.

Harrison and other organizers saw
interesting parallels between the political
situation of 2008 and that of 1968. He
said, students should "test that compari»
son by asking the speakers their opinions

on the present debates around the Iraq war as compared to the
presidential debates in 1958 and the Vietnam War,"

Pte-symposium events began last Sunday with an alumni
discussion about Grinncll m 1968 and continued with a prep
release screening or" the documentary “Generations 68" {01*

“Some saw [past speakers] as too radi-
cal, and some might

regard Friedman as too conservative given
his views on globalization," she said. "Per-
sonrtlly, I think he will give a very good
address.”

In the future, Grinnell may continue
to see big names addressing its graduates.
The College drastically raised its payment
to commencement speakers from $15,000
to $50,000, effective this year. “[The buds
get increase] says how serious the college
is in investing in a good commencement speaker,"B1y said.

Prior to his selection for commencement, Friedman already
had a Grinnell connection. Friedman’s
wife Ann is a member of the Bucks-
baurn family, the daughter orthc name-
sake for Grinneil's center for the Arts.
According to Biy, this connection “may
have given us an easier entre to him, but
had no bearing in our decision to ask
him,"she said. “He is very excited about
being here."

Many seniors expressed similar ere
cirement."I'm genuinely excited to have
Thomas Friedman traveling here,” said Junayd Mahmood '09.
