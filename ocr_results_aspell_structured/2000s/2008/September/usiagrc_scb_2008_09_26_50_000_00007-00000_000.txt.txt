Old—school charm
wins in furry, fun story

First ofall, pandas are awesome. Second of
all/(1mg Fa Pall/la stars a panda. Therefore,
Kmig Fl! Pam/a is awesome. Hows that for

logic?

Although the plot of Kim! Fl! Pillldi’l is
somewhat cliched (unlikely hero has greatness
thrust upon him; saves village) the movre’s efr
fervescent energy and slick animation make it
a truly enjoyable film. Po (Jack Black) is a lazy
teenage panda that works in his fathers noo—

dle shop and spends every free moment day-
dreaming about the kung fu masters that train
nearby. When Po is accidentally chosen to fuls
till an ancient prophecy, he joins his idolsiall

Jackie Chaniin training.

You can probably guess what happens
next. Po discovers the secret rrrgredient to

Ling, the evil snow leopard. Black's lovable
persona and girrhy enthusiasm easily win over
the serious villain in a battle scene right out of
a comic book.

Visually, Kong Fu Panda has all the beauty
of the best in old-school animation. Dream-
works, which hadn’t made a killer animation
movie before this. should be applauded,

The narrative action of the film after that
is a bit ofa letdown, brit the detailing and [ex-
tures that abound throughout the village are
great. Although the movie utilizes the minute
detailing that has become a trademark ofanis
ination in the last few years, it refrains from
going “all the wayLir's clear that this is a fan
tasy world, simplified and intensified for the
screen.

In the end, Kung Fu Pan/{a is a movie that
celebrates individuality and dCICflninﬂllOl‘li
Although there are an abundance of“cveryonc

can do anything they set their minds to, Panda
stands out because of its unapologetic humor
and enthusiasm. Many Piitar films are essen-
tially two films: one safe and G-rated for the
kids, one cynical and doublcscntendred for the
adults. Dreamworks, however. refuses to make
the kind of rnsjokes that Piuxar has become
known for.

Although Kong Fu Panda might be sort of
predictable, it‘s only so in the best way pos-
sible. In the end, it's lovable and familiar.

WWII film bristles with
tension in every scene

The Academy {\waidtwinning German
film and true story T/ze CDUIi/ﬂl/Z'l/N'J thrusts
us into the world of Salomon sorowitsch,
a Berlin resident during \NW'll who is caps
tui-ed and forced into a concentration camp
for people with special counterfeiting abilities.
A uniquelyrcrafted film about a unique event,

The Counter
feiters
(2 006)

this film pulls the audience from one strange
scene to the next through its vivid cinematog-
raphy and clear attention to derail,

Sorowitsch must immediately shift from
his comfortable and partysfilled lifestyle to
the unpredictable counterfeiting job funding
the Nazi project where he never knows which
mistake will cost him his life. This visual style
moves us with the actors where we observe the
surroundings as rfwc were one of the prisons
ers who see the sky only through the cold wire
mesh above them.

However, the film's paranoid atmosphere
also creates tension and momentum in its plot
without visuals. Some of the most captivating
and compelling scenes utilize the power ofthe
unknown. one disturbing scene takes place
on the other side ofa wall where the prisoners
can only hear the horriﬁc sounds ofa violent
struggle on the other side.

The actors arid acticsses play their roles so
quietly and precisely that the audience feels
compelled to know more about them. As the
stakes rise, we delve deeper and deeper into the
emotions ofthe characters. He must ultimately
choose between loyalty to his comrade bent on
sabotage and compliance with the Nazis who
protect him.

T/ze Cmm/eifexrerr sucks you in from the
moment Sorowitsch is captured andholds you
in intrigued uneasiness until the very end.

SOL creates film and festival celebrating culture

BYJAMES ANTHoFER

Over a year ago, the members of the Stu-
dent Oiganization of Latinos/Latinas (SOL)
envisioned a movie documenting the life of
the club that they could show to new or pro
speetive students and gift to the seniors who
had been a part ofthe club’s growth.

Tonight at 7:00, as part of the events dur—
ing Hispanic Heritage Month, this vision will
come to fruition in a way radically different
and much larger than any members ofthe club
ever envisioned.

Gustavo Arambula ’10, one of the meme
bers of the club who led the project, said that
the transformation grew out of a tough start.
“We really had no idea what the movie was
going to be when we started," he said

The group knew they liked the style ofthe
HBO Latino program Habla Mas,which tells
short anecdotes of Latinos living in the U.S.
They followed the show's style by broadening
the focus to the Grinnell community overall,
notjust SOL, but then asked “What does L“,
tino culture mean to you?" which meant that
they could tell anyone’s story, not just those of

soon enough “Crossing Boundaries of
Latino Identity", the name they chose, was in
full swing, “We really decided to dedicate our
selves to this project by second semester." said
Anastasia Sample ’10, cosleader of SOL.

That’s because the movie ended up featur—
ing students and staff from all backgrounds
and cultural origins, each answering the ques-
tion in different ways and in both English and
Spanish,

The entire film was filmed and edited by
SOL members, and Arambula, who was pres
ent for the whole process, was surprised by
how much he learned. “Race, whatever that is,
doesn't just define you a Latino," he said. “You
should come see the movie. because what it
turned out to be isn’t easily explainable.”

This afternoon, the Spanish Department,
in conjunction with SOL, wiu also bring an
author and academic who may otter a new
perspective into what the movie is all about.
Santiago vaquerasvasouez, a writer and Loris
no Studies professor at University of Iowa, will
speak about Latino identity in a speech entir

p.m. Valerie Benoist, chair of the department,
had been looking to bring Vaquera—Vasquez
since she had heard of his work and because
she was looking to create a new position in
Latino Studies.

In an unusual confluence of events. the
members of SOL had met the writer around
the same time and asked Benoist about brings
ing him. “We went to Iowa City to meet With
one ofour peer groups, ALMA (Association
ofLarinos Moving Ahead) to try to reach out
to these groups, which was one of our goals
last year," said Sample. “Santiago was at their
meeting, and we really liked him."

Benoist, once realizing that “we had met
the same guy",was not surprised by the seem-
ing coincidence, “There aren't very many peo-
ple doing what Santiago is doing [in telling the
stories of the US/ Mexican border culture]."
she said. "were working on a common goal."

This goal, to spread knowledge and aware
ness of Latino culture, has been a part of ev—
erything SOL has done so far this month,
including throwing a Harris Party last Friday,

the movie and speaker tonight, and holding
the Hispanic Heritage Festival on‘oct 3.

The festival will feature both groups from
on campus, including salsa dancing, traditional
folkl dancing, a poetry reading. and singing.
and two outside groups— Mariachi Luna y
Sol and Calle stir. Mariachi is a group from
a nonprofit organization in Omaha that fo-
cuses on Latino issues, and Call: Sur is a band,
directed by an alumnus, that plays traditional
Latino music.

l-Ia Na Park '09, who is the main SOL
member organizing the festival, again em,
phasized how SOL is trying to reach out to
its community, “with these groups, we’re ex-
panding our reach into the Midwest and keep»
ing ties with the older Gtinnell community,"
she said. “There's a misconception that SOL
is only for Latinos, but we really hope that all
staff and students will come to the event on
Friday night."

Tonight’s movie, a big step forward for
SOL, is only the beginning for the club and
has shown how the most modest idea can be
come a huge awareness-raising event.
