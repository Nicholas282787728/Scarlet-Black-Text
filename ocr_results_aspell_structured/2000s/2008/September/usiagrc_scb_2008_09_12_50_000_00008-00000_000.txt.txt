A5 I walked towald Nollcn House to meet
the president ofotlr hool, Russell K, Osgood.
Iwontlcrcrl how to. art up a canvas ion that
would provide ml: with a small pee into his
life outside of the academic and administrar
rive sphere. But before 1 could even bcg
probe, Osgood, with an almost satisfre ,rnir-k,
confrrrncd all my preconceptions. “My friends
think I was born with a tle on," he said.

Most Grinnellians would agree with this
statement—perhaps excluding the few who
have encountered this ‘celebrity' in brrght red
Iunning shorts at 5 am There may not be a
seclet identity lurking behind the serious and
impeccably preci demeanor Osgood por-
trays, but there is—as some students need to
be remindedia human being.

Unlike most college students, Osgood has
“never gone to bed at four." and says, “I had
no artistic or musical competence, and wasn't
much ofa sports person either." Instead, Ose
good's younger years were spent hiking with
his older brother and,as he puts it, “doing fame
ily things, since I had a very large family,”

In canon, I was n lulu man

“Ifl could say so, i ihinkl had everything
that comes wrrh a perfectly happy childhood."
Part ofOsgood s thil ldhood was also shaped
by his Scottish heritage. the mothers side ot
his fanuly emigrated from Scotland, and many

-of his Iclatives still live there Osgood recalls

“havlllg sot-t ofgrown up rn two countries, two
cultures, siInullilneouslyiliavlng a sense of
belonging to two national identrtres."

“The immigrant experience is very impure
rant to rue and has to a large extent shaped
who I am today," he said

After graduating from Yale University
with a B.A. in History. Osgood found himself
at a crossroads. He considered both graduate
and law school, but ultimately, his ambivae
lence combined with an “obligation to serve"
his country led Osgood to enlist lumseltin the
navy

Although the Vietnam war ended two
days after he was assigned to a division, os-
good said that his expeiience in the navy was
lrfe altering. “1 was assigned to a division of
23 sailors. None of them had graduated from
college, and some hadn't even graduated from
high school," he said. “Most of these kids had
joined the army because something had gone
ofthe rails and thls was a good escape route."

Osgood believes it was hrs time spent as a
navy ofﬁcer that played an integral role in de~
termInIng that he wanted to spend the rest of
his life working with peop pl.e lfl hadnt been
a navy officel. l probablv wouldnt be here or
anywhere concerning education, he said

Since he rs thought of prrmarily as presie
dent. most students have a hard time lmugln’
ing Osgood In the classroom settlng.“1'm not
a hard professor," Osgood said. “I don't believe
in it. What you want to do is get under their
skin, make them want to be like you, or more
importantly. make rhern want to inculcate your
skills, your abilities." he said.

Given that Osgood completed his undere
graduate degree at Yale. acted as a dean at Core
nell University and taught at Boston Univere
siry, one might wonder what has kept him at
such a small remote school for the past eleven
years, “I think that this place has a strong sense
ofidenriry," he said. “You have more ofan op-
portunity to take control ofyour own lives and
more importantly students get to play a bigger
role."

Having served in the navy and worked as a
lawyer, a professor, and frnally a president, os-
good is happy with the roles he has played. “I
love the life I have lived and would not change
anything," he said. “But I'd love to go to Sic-
il l"

y There is more to Russell K. Osgood than
5 am. dog \imlks and appointments to discuss
self Governance. Maybe the reason we do not
see it is simply because we do not bother to
ask. After all,just because he was born with a
tie on does not mean it cannotloosen up every
once in a while.

Joanna Harris arrived in Grinnell in 1855 at the age of 11Y
and did not venture much farther until her death at the age of
87 in 1931, She graduated in 1865 as the first female graduate
of Grinnell College dnd the first woman to graduate from a
college west ofrhe Mississippi River.

Joanna was born in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, and her
family traveled to Farmlngton, Iowa by covered wagon. They
did not stay in Farmington long, because their neighbols che
mostly prcesltvery and the I’lillrls family “believed in flccdoln
for both black and white," rdIng to the funelal address for
Hunts given by Rev. EM Vittum,Joauna's pastor at the Corie
gregarional Church of or. oil.

Vitturn remarked at Joanna's funeral that the women were
denied their degrees because the college ofﬁcials “felt a little
delicacy in declaring that the young ladies were bachelors of
arts."

‘At’rerwards," Vimlm continued, “they atoned for their ne-
glect and gave the degrees the ladies had earned."

At Grinncll, joanna Inet Robert M. l-Iaines, who gradu-
ared with Joanna in 1865.They were married two years later in
1867, and Joanna, then 22, became Joanna Harris I’Iaines.

l’lcr obituary called joauua a “natural teacher." At the time
of her marriage to RobertJoanna held a teaching position at a
college where Robert also worked, Before that, she spent two
years teaching at a school in Troy, Iowa, She would later teach
at GI‘inIIcll High School.
