Football looks to improve on last season, suprise conferenc

BYJOHN FRANCIS Bu
As football teams across the country has
gun their camps and settled back into their
routines, the Grinnell College Pioneers once
again returned to their cornrbordcred fields
for another season. But missing were many
of the old faces and large spans of free time.
In fainiliarity's place were new coaches with
bursting ambitions and a full day of mentally
and physically strenuous football. “We had a
tough camp," said Head Coach Max Hawsey.
"But our guys really embraced the change and
what we‘ve established...our improvements

are going to show on the field."
Led by first-year Head Coach Maa
Hawsey and a relatively young coaching staff,

the Pioneers returned eight offensive and ten ,

defensive starters, and will be strengthenedby
an enormous recruit-class of 22 new players.
It is with tlus strength in numbers and youth
that the Pioneers hope to greatly rebound
from their 1-9 record last season.

on defense, the team will be led by a
strong defensive backfield. “we‘re returning
two safeties and defensive backs who have 20
starts each,"said Captain Jonathan Antrim ’09.
The linebacker position, which sees four up—
perclassmen with significant playing time vyr
ing for tackles, will prove to be a rod ofsecuiity
for the Pioneers. John Hereford ’10 will return
to the position after a team leading 90 tackles
last year. He will be supported by Captain Ty-
ler Schaeffer '09, and Brett Maloney ’09 both
seniors with plenty of playtime under their
belts. Lastly, Ryan Fletcher ’11 who made 80
tackles in an impressive first year, will also see
plenty ofplaying time. ‘

Even though much of the defense is
“banged up," Hawsey is still confident in their
ability to deliver. "A couple ofthe [linebackers]
are banged up,'j said Hawsey. “But hopefully

‘ we're going to be fine."

The defensive line will not go unnoticed
during the season under. Clinton Follete, ‘11,
who plays defensive tackle, and cited the so-
lidity of the line. “We're like a rock,” Follete
said.

offensively, the team will center around an
offensive line that returns four starters to block
for a backfield that has seen many changes in
the past year. Gone are the days of receivers

filling in at the quarterback position, where
now Mike Bogard'12,will start. The freshman
class brought with it two quarterbacks, Bogard
and Jimmy Borrasso '12, who also expects to
see plenty of time behind the center. Through
camp, the two quarterbacks competed evenly,
said Antrim, “There was no drop when either
of them came into play," he said.

Where wide receivers are going to fill in,
however, is in the backﬁeld. C]. Moore '09,

originally a slot receiver, will be starting at
runningbaek after the seasoneending injury of
Mike Connolly ’11 during camp. Expectations
ofConnolly were high, and the team has had
to adapt to his absence. '“It changes our dye
namic on offense and what we were going to
do," Hawsey said. “But I don’t want to say it
will hurt us."

After a nearly winless season last year, the
Pioneers hope to shed their losing image from

the start, said Hawsey. The Pioneers will begin
their season this Saturday, Septﬁ, as they take
on noneconferenee foes Cornell College,

After Cornell, the Pioneers will take on
their first true test, against perennial powers
house and conference champions SL Norbert.
“We can send a loud message at Norbert,"
Antrim said, “It’s a different Grinnell team
than it has been in the past."

With the possibility of qualifying for the
national competition in their sights, the men’s
cross country team has been training hard. “As
a team we are more focused from last year," said
captain David Montgomery ’10. “A lot of re—
niming mnners know what it takes to do well
and have a lot ofexpcrience with running."

The team showed off its experience with a
third-place finish this past weekend at the Bob
Tirnmons Classic hosted by the University of
Kansas. Henry Reich ’09 led the Pioneers with
an eight place finish with a time of 25:23.1.
“Doing the little things to push the limit and
getting used to and looking forward to the pain
of the running will really help the team,” said
Reich. “[Cross country comes down to] who
can put up with the most pain."

Based on preseason rankings released by
the Us. Track and Field and Cross Country
Coaches Association, Grinnell is ranked fifth in
the NCAA DMsioneIII Central chion,wliich
is composed of several conferences including
the MWC. This bodes well for the Pioneers, as
the top five teams at the regional meet advance
to the. national competition, though preseason
rankings are only preliminary,

Grinnell is looking forward to their only
regular home meet ofthe season, the annual Les
Duke. About 30 schools from four to five states
will come to compete in this annual event that

will take place on September 13. Coach Will
Freeman still thinks it is a little too early to
tell who the big competition will be, but Mont
mouth College in Illinois and St. Norbert Cole
lcge in Wiscon-
sin arc schools to
look out for.
With many
returning run—
nets, new talent,
and this year’s re-
gional competi»
tion being hosted
at Grinnell, the
cross-country
(Cam hopes to
use that home
course advantage
to tip the scale in
their favor. “The
first race was
still a little shaky
and we need to
work on running
smarter races
(pacing) and
running tough,"
said an optimist
tic Montgomery “This team has the opportu-
nity to accomplish ‘.l lot."

The Women’s Cross Country team is
poised to capture their fifth consecutive cone
feienee championship as they return a slew
ofveterans and welcome a large class offirsrr
years. “[The
team] is start
ing at it good
place," said
captain Liz
Inch ‘09. “But
it is only going
to get better."
The team is
returning 25
runners along
with 15 neW’

comers.

The team
began the sea—
son strong this
past week-
end ﬁnish-
ing third with
96 points at
the Bob Tim-
mons Classic
hosted by the

, University of
Kansas. Juch paced the Pioneers by placing
20th (21:07r6) and was followed by Cath-

erine Bisiguano '12 with at 22nd place finish
(21:12.2). '

The team's first meet this past weekend
allowed them to get their feet wet and back
into the swing of competitive running, as
many runners are back this year from past
injuries or semesters studying abroad.

While the team is still working to perfect
athletic performance, the feeling ofcohesion
is already present on the team. As first-years

and upperclassmcn are getting along very

well with each other.

“We are family before teammates," said
coecaprain Becky Bessinger '09. “Family be-
fore competitors."

Though this family ofcompetitors is still
working on improving on last year's perfor-
mances, they will be looking forward to the
advantage of hosting two home meets this
season.

The Les Duke and NCAA D3 Central
Regional meet will both take place at the
Oakland Acres Golf Clubjust north ofcame

nus

The family atmosphere combined with
the home meets should fare well for the Pier
neets. “Our strength about this season," said
Bessingcr, “is that we have eight or nine res
ally strong runners that are close together.”
