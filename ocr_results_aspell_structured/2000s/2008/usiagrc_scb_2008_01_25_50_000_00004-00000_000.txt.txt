The Lion King
(1994)

You know you just can’t
wait to take a nostalgic trip
down Disney memory lane

This week, as part of the constant effort to
expand the minds and horizons ofGtinnellians,
the Films Committee will hold a screening of
a classic saga of revenge and redemption, love
and betrayal. This timeless piece of Amerir
can cinema is not for the faint of heart or the
weak of mind, and critics throughout the years
have analyzed the true message of the fan-r
ily epic. Challenging the social constructs of
government, religion and gender, this contmr
versial film is not to be watched so much as
absorbediyes, this Friday, Disney’s The Lion
King will be showing on campus.

The tale begins with the Christ—like birth
of the prophetic young heir, Simba. But all is
not well in the pride-landstThe cunning claws
of Simba’s dreaded Uncle scar abruprly rip
asunder the circle oflife. Racked by grief and
shame, Simba leaves the safety ofhis kingdom
to begin his Homeric quest and come of age.
Join him on his journey as he uncovers the sea
ctets of his destiny and ﬁnds the path to true
salvation. -

Infused with the heartrwrenching musical
stylings of Sir Elton John, TI]: Lam King is a
feast for the senses and the soul. Raﬁki will
guide you, along with Simba. to the realization
ofyour full potential as the ﬁerce lion that you
really are. While your disgraceﬁll cohorts ena
gage in mindless tomfoolery and the destruca
tion ottheir highly educated brain cells, come
take part in the intellectual revolution that has
swept the nation, So have some pride and be
prepared, because Simba can’t wait to be king.
Can you?

boulders to a poisonous snake filled pit and
hundreds of nameless henchmen.

The plot simply acts as a framework to al-
low one action scene after another. Our hero
spends the entire movie more or less hanging
on by a thread, fighting back continuous cases
of mortal peril. It all feels, in the words of
Jones himself. as though he's "making this up
as I go along."This is certainly not a bad thing,
and the plot works with this concept rather
than against it.

The movie is immensely dynamic, John
Williams’ score is precise, stirring and ins-pie
rational or moody and mysterious, as the case
requires. Tire sound effects complement it,
Every punch connects vvrth a satisfying thump
and every gunshot explodes like a Howitzer,
The special cttccts and stunts are wonderment
in their own right. Jones positively bounces all
over the screen, be he swinging from vines or
clambering over troop trucks (or under them,
as the case may be)

What renlly makes this movie so much
better than its many counterparts is its sense
of humor. The movie is genuinely funny, ale
though rarely do the laughs come from the
dialogue or obvious gagsMuch ofit is derived
from the personality of Jones himself, a sort
of tonguerinrcheek portrayal of Humphrey
Bogart’s classic tough guy.

That being said, the funniest bit ofthe en,
tire movie is a scene that proves once and for
all the old saying “Never bring a knife to a gun
ﬁght."lt's almost as if director Steven Spielr
berg recognizes the ridiculous portrayal that
he has laid out and, rather than try to convrnce
us all that it is the tcaldea1.he sits back and

Star Wars
(1977)

A galaxy far, far away
that hits close to home

if you're anything like me, going to the
movies is all about being entertained, Further
more, this beautifully simply goal has nothing
to do with how "important"a movie is, or how
“revolutionary" its special effects were. So, my
review of George Lucas’s not were will steer
clear of those platitudiuous praises which
sound more like a lecture on film history than
the teactions ofa ﬂeshrandrblood viewer,

For those of you who haven't already seen
this classic, here is a brief outline ofits archer
typal plot, At some point in time long, long
ago in some galary far, far away, interagalaca
tic civilization was in the clutches of an evil
Empire, run by such dubious fellows ns Dnrrh
Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones). Luckr
ily, a feisty Rebel Alliance has emerged, and
has stolen the master plans of the Death Star,

farm boy, Luke Skywallter (Mark Halnill),on a
mission to rescue Princess Leia with compan-

Sm Wart is plot-driven, in that many of
its charncrcrs'nctions seem geared only toward
keeping things moving. But 1 can forgive an
action movie for being an action movie, espe»
cially in light of the ﬁlm's other merits. The
pace of the plot never were me out, for those
moments m between laser tights were rich
enough with real emotion and meaning to re

Like all good heroes, Skywalker stands out,
and not merely because he interacts so much
with aliens and robots Hamill's charisma and

Lucas placed profound moments behind
the grandiose story of good and evil. I loved
the moments that drew us into another world.
When Luke and capo go into an interama
lactic bar in search of a pilot, their interactions
perfectly parody the working ofcarthling bars,
leaving us with the feeling that maybe sciafr
doesn't have to be lame and sterile. Lucas' Mt
