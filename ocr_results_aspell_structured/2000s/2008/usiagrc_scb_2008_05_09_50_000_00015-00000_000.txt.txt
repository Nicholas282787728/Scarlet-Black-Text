Tennis Teams reach for» new heights at lregionals

For the first time in school histoly, the Gtinnell Men’s Tennis
Team captured a victory at the NCAA Division 111 Toulnament,
With strong overall play the team defeated Westminster Colt
lcge 570 in the ﬁrst round ofthe tournament, Unfortunately, the
team's success was accompanied by some disappointment when
doubles players Dan LaFountaine’O? and Nate Fox'09 had their
invitation to nationals later revoked.

The invatation unis rescindcd in response to a protest from
Denison College. The protest was lodged because Coach Andy
Hamilton ’85 is a member of the committee that determines
player's ranlts. “The NCAA released me nationals selection,
which included Dan and Nate, on Monday
afternoon," said Hamilton. "On Tuesday, a
team which was left off the invitation list ﬁled
a protest due to me being involved in setting
the rankings."

The committee evaluated the records of
the two doubles teams and ultimately decided
instead to invite the other them. “[The com-
mittee] determined that the other team held a
slight edge over Dan and Nate based on one
variable—record versus NCAA tournament
participants,” said Hamilton.

The overturning of the invitation did not
come as good news to the doubles pair. “The NCAA overruled
the regional committee, so we're screwed," said Fox. ”There's not
much we can do now," Their invitation was given to a team from
Denison College, and they are now listed as “off-site doubles al-
ternates.” .

Fox and LaFountaine are already looking ahead to their so
nior years and their last bid for Nationals. “We were so close, we
tasted it," said Fox.

“There was a procedural el'lot,l)ut they have a wonderful shot
tor next year." said Hamilton. “They're deﬁnitely on the regional
and national ladal.”

Despitc the disappointment, thc roam was still happy with
its success at the Division III Tournament, capturing the his
tone tirstrtim: win. Hamilton cites improved team solidarity as a
prime factor in its recordrbrealting success. “This team is unusu-
ally eonneeted," he said “I can’t take credit for it, but it enhances
the playing, the traveling, the recruiting, everything."

Following the victory, the Pioncers faced a challenge against
the number two-tanked D-lII team in the nation: the Waslir

ngton University bears. Even though the
Pioneers put fourth a valiant effort, they were
unable to overcome the Bears.

The team ended the season with a 21-7
record, including winning their 5th consecu-
tive MWC championship. “we really came
together as a team this year,” said LaFoun-
taine. “Even though we had some heartbreak
inglosscs.”

Next year the team will struggle with the
losses of senior players DJ. Warden '03, Jor-
dan Lee '08, and Daniel Malarkey ’08. “Our

. goal for next year is to challenge for the Mid—
west conference championship,” said Hamilton. “1 also want to
provide a challenging schedule so that our top players can achieve
the best regional ranking possible."

With the Pioneers set to do well next year, many on the
team have high expectations. "l'd like to see us pulling some wins
against the top tier teams," said returning singles player Sam
Raife ’10. “And continue our good performance at the NCAA
tournament.”

After winning the MWC championship in the fall, the
Grinnell Womcn's Tennis team had to wait till the spring sea
son to compete in NCAA chionals. Aside from Regionals, the
team is looking torwartl to doing well next season.

With such a long biealt between conference and rcgionnls,
the team vms left at a disadvantage. “it’s really hard because most
of the teams that were going to regionals have been playing since
the end ofJanuaty," said Camila Alarcon Cordon'og."we played
really well considering the limited amount of practice time."

Even though the team had not played in sometime, the
team performed stron this spring, going srz heading into the
NCAA Division III egional Tournament. “This spring season
we played extremely well,"said susan Klumpncr’oa “With the
exception ofout Florida games, we won all of our matches be»
fore regionals."

Gtinnell’s lineup changed substantially from the fall season,
as Maya Lipett '09 went abroad and new doubles teams had
to be formed. Even with those changes Gtinnell played strong
throughout opening round match, even though they eventually
lost to Coe College 5-0. “ Ifwe presented our {all season lineup,
we would have had a better chance," said Klumpner. “We could
have beat Coe 673 or 574."

With the spring season now over, the women’s tennis team
is now looking towards next year, where they will be without
Cordon, Margaret Block '08, and Rachel Engh ’08. Despite the
{act the team will be losing three seniors, there will be a new
crop ofﬁrst-yeats to replace them. “We have two top recruits
coming next year," said Klumpner. “We hope to put them ﬁrst
and second singles.”

With the inﬁlsion of new players, the team expects to repeat
as conference champions, citing team cohesion. "On the whole,
we have a great team dynamic," said Alarcon. “We all have the
same goals."
