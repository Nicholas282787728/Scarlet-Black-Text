BYMATT ZMUDKK

Last Saturday afternoon, a full crowd packed the Wall
to enjoy a strange taxicab conversation, the apocalypse and
the musings of the Cedar Rapids Chess Club all in one
sitting.

This collision ofstylcs and settings is typical otcrinncll
Independent Theatre (GITTS annual OnseAct Festival,
which has shown student-written and student-directed
plays since 2006.

-This year's festival featured ﬁve plays written by Jo
Krukowski ’08, Sean Dunawny ’085, Ben Halliburton ’08,
Sarah Mirk '08, and Rachel Walbcrg '09. Krukowski’s play
"Apocalypse Huh?" about a trip to a 7-Eleven just before an
asteroid hits Earth, won the Theatre Department's Barbara
Clark Playwriting Contest this year.

The play was her ﬁrst playwriting experience, out she
loved the response that she received “It’s a little intimi-
dating to put your work up in front of people, but it also
makes it really satisfying when you do strike a chord with
[them],"she said. “After my play, I heard a bunch ofpeoplc

say ‘Dude, let’s go to the 7eEleven .

GIT Caelcader Christian Ricci ‘08 was excited about
the quality of the plays that were submitted. “This year
was encouraging due to rhc {act that
we didn’t have a playwriting class," he

tionrll." However, the Wall was a more formal performance
space than he would have liked. "It was difﬁcult to ﬁnd
a lounge because most were preparing
for their various pres or postrWaltz

said. “We didn’t have a guarantee of "Ill/5 year W05 encouraging due [0 [he parties." he said,“TheWall was really

Dunaway, another ﬁrst-time write don”
er, credits GIT’s first student—written
oneracts performance two years ago
with inspiring him to write his play,

“Frivolous."“Flrst year, I saw GIT and
got inspired, and that was when 1 actually wrote this play,"
he said.

In addition to writing his own play, Dunaway ﬁlled the
lead role in Krukowskj’s play, showing the cooperative na
ture of GIT. "[I guess she] couldn’t think of anyone who
embodied the character as well as me," he said. “I tried
to keep my mouth shut as much as possible in rehearsals
(though)”. ‘

Ricci loved the audience turnout, calling it "excepe

plays being available, but they came fad [hm we did/ill have a Mal/Willing a last resort—it was smaller than I'd

hoped ”
After fall’s Neverland Players
‘ ‘ ' " and the American Theater ro‘cct in
ChrlSlldn RICO 08 April, GIT can claim this afiti third
production this ycarr “GIT has been
growing compared to where it was be-
fore I came," Ricci said, adding that he’s grateful for under'
class interest as playwrights, directors and actors.

“It’sjust agrear chance to act, even ifyou don’t have a lot
orexperience," said Dunaway. He encouraged men to join
GIT, citing a small pool of male actors to choose from.

’ Krukowski agreed but also added that the hidden tale
ent on campus helped to inspire her. “You don't need to go
very far to find great ideas and great actors, great stuff to
produce," she said.
