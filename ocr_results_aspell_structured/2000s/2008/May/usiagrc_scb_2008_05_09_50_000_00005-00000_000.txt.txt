Rabbi Darkside ’00 brings MTV to KDIC

While 1(ch has upgraded its digs since
moving into the JRC, it is still far from being
a professional music studio. However, earlier
this week the big leagues came to tape at the
college’s radio station.

On Tuesday May 6th, MTV came to calm
pus to ﬁlm an episode ofthe reality television
show Made in the KDIC studios. The show
follows one high school student who, over the
course ofa few weeks condensed into one hour
ofTV time, to acquire a new skill or accomplish
some endeavort A typical show might show a
prom queen-type becoming a skateboarder, or
vice versa. To help the teenagers learn their
new talent, MTV hires a “Made Coach," an
expert in the ﬁeld who serves as a mentor.

For an episode set to air in early June in
which a girl from Cedar Rapids, lowa wishes
to become a DJ and bearaboxcr, MTV hired
a Grinnell alum, Sam Sellers ’00, aka “Rabbi
Darkside," to serve as her coach “I’m an MC,
and a DJ, and a beat-boxer, in that order,“said
Sellers.

MTV decided to utilize the KDIC studio
to show the student acquiring firsthand expe—
rience in a radio studio. “ltwasjusr to getsome
shots of them around some real equipment,"
said Ben Lebsack ’08, who hosted the KDIC
show that MTV ﬁlmed. “The Made girl did a
little beattboxing and I had an interview with
[Sellers]."

Whilc the show attempts to portray a
sense of realism, chsack said he thought that
even though the show sought to portray it as
an example of practical experience,the filming
lacked authenticity.

“They made me do a lot of fake stuff,
which I feel like I’m going to look kind of
weirdi" Lebsack said. “They couldn’t record
with music in the studio because they don’t
want to have to deal with getting the rights to
the songs. so I’d have to turn offthe music and
pretended to scratch with no music on.“

While Lebsaclt said he was not particularly
impressed by the girl who was being made, he
found Sellers to be an exciting presence in
the studio. “He was pretty talkative and loud,”
said Lebsack. “He said he wished we could be
drinking in there."

After MTV hired him, Sellers pushed to
involve Grilmell College in the ﬁlming ofth:
show. “My production input on the show was
‘hey, we should talte a day, go to Grinnell, visit
KDIC, chill out,"' he said.

In addition to his career as Rabbi Darkside,
Sellers has taught children ranging from ﬁrst
grade to high school. After graduating from
Grinnell, Sellers moved to New York City.

“I went there to do some hipehop living
and teach some kids, and I was :1 public school
teacher {or four years," he said.

sellers is no longer a public school teacher
and instead has chosen to rake a new career
track in combining his love of music with his
work teaching kids.

“I teach performance poetry, turntablism,
music production, song writing," he said. “I

work for a nonprofit who sets me up in with
residencies in public schools."

While Seller has traveled a long way since
his time at Grinnell, including a European
tour, he still found the community welcoming
on his return. “I think Grinnell is the kind of
place where once you’re a student, once you’re
an alum, you’re always part of this community,"
Sdlers said.
