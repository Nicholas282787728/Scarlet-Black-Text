New coach aims high

BY SARAH ERVIN

Last year, Tufts women’s basketball assistant
coach Kate Gluckman helped her team soar to
new heights, now she will try to work her magic
in the cotnﬁclds of Iowa.

Starting this the hill, Gluckman will become
head coach for the Giinnell Women’s Basketball
Team, replacing current head coach Andy Ham;
ilton 'ss.

Gluckman, who graduated from Tufts in
2004, said that she hopes to take the team “to the
top echelon of the Midwest Conference.”

In 2006, Gluckinan became the assistant
coach atTufts, and during the 2006-2007 season
she helped the team to an 8-1 recoid, the best re-
cord in school history “It was a great opportunity
to get a good, young coach," said Greg Wallace,
athletic director.

Although this is Gluckman’s ﬁrst head coach
ing position, she and Athletic Director Greg
Wallace believe she is prepared to ﬁll the shoes of
Coach Andy Hamilton.

“I would be ovettconﬁdent and cocky in said
I wasn't [nervous]," said Gluckrnan, “But I feel
very supported at Grinnell and it's great having
Coach Hamilton on campus."

Hamilton, who has coached the Pioneers for

six years, will stay on at Grinnell as the coach of
both the men's and women's tennis teams and,
starting next year, as assistant athletic director,

Even with Hamilton's departure, the program
has high expectations for the future, “I think
Coach Hamilton has left a good squad ofrcturn-
mg young players," Wallace said. “And we’ll see
growth in the players and the coach."

one of Gluckman’s main goals is to foster a
strong work ethic on the team, Before Gluckman
even starts practices with the team in thc fall, she
will institute summer workouts to prepare the
young team to kick it lip a notch. “I'm not alt
lowed to ask them to come back early from sums
met break,” she said. “But I’d like to."

Because Gl‘lnncll considers coaches to be
members of the faculty, and uses the same hir—
ing process for coaching and faculty positions,
Cluckrnan had to go through a particularly scrur
pulous interview process to secure thc coaching
position. In addition to leading sports teams,
coaches are expected to teach physical education
classes.

”[The hiring process] is very rigorous, which
isn't true at a lot of our peer schools,”said Wal-
lace,

Despite the intensity of her visits to Grinnell,

Gluckrnans only complaint is with the weather.
“It was so much colder than I'd anticipated," she
said.

Behind Grinnell athletics: managers

BYJIM MALEWITZ

Without swinging a bat, running wind
sprints, or throwing a touchdown, Grinnell pro-
vides numerous opportunities for student in-
volvement in varsity and club athletics.

But for those looking for a more integrated
nontathletic role with a team, there is no better
opportunity than to become a team manager. Petr
forming a multitude of tasks while logging hours
at ptactices and contests, Grinnell sports manag—
ers are often treated like extra teammates—even
if their names don’t show up in die post-game
boxseores,

Baseball manager Dan Ellwcin '11 and Men's
Basketball Manager Stephanie Goggin '10 each
broke into managing through their participation
in other sports. A football player, Ellwein knew
Assistant Football Coach and Head Baseball
CoachTim Hollibaugh through their mutual in—
volvement in football, while women's golf coach
Dave Arsenaulr interested Goggin in the basket-
ball position tluough his role as her golf coach.

However, other sports havc volunteer mans
agers. Water Polo Manager Emily Summers
’10,bceamc manager this year after receiving a
careerrending injury in the sport as a ﬁrstryeat.
Despite not being able to play, she wanted to be

an active member of the tearn.As a former par—
ticipant, summers — who is also a member of the
swim team A has no trouble at all feeling like a
teammate. “Obviously I'm not playing, so that's
a completely different aspect of the game, but I
still feel really included," she said.

While Dan Ellwein does not consider him»
selfa member ofthe squad, the players “treat him
like just another kid on the team." As for Gog-
gin, the players have generally made her feel as if
she is one of the team. “I never have a problem
feeling included." said Goggillt “It's like hanging
out with 20 ofmy brothers who are also some of
my best friends."

Managerial loles can also give students a
chance to play a little. Ellwcin, who has played
baseball a bit in the past, says that sometimes
he takes grounder: at pmctice.Though she de-
scribes herself as the “worst basketball player
ever," Goggin sometimes showcases her lack of
skills by shooting 3npointets at practice.

When schoolwork and team activities inevir
tably conﬂict, coaches tend to be ﬂexible and unr
derstnnding with their managers. “Coach [Hols
libaugh] is really lenient,“ says Ellwein. “Ifl have
to miss a ptaetlce,1 can.”

But with challenging course loads, managers

are sometime forced to choose school over the
team. For Goggin, this choice came at a particu-
larly difﬁcult moment when she was unable to
travel to Appleton Wisconsin for the Midwest
conference Tournament semifinal game. “i can
justify missing class for a sport that lin in,"she
said. “But since I’m just a manager, I couldn't
take the time oFfof school."

Forced to View the heartbreaking end of the
Pioneers' season [a 124—122 loss to Carroll Col—
lege] on camplls via an internet broadcast, the
manager felt “helpless“.

“I couldn‘t help but wonder if my being
there could have helped the guys out a litde bit
more," Goggin said. “1 question whether my ac»
tual being there could have made the point dif
ference."

During games, she performs the important‘

tasks of tuning players shifts and keeping a rally
ofthe effectiveness of each vlmve of players on
the court. Her closenesswith Lhe team made her
feel guilty about missing the big game.

Despite the necessary time commitment
and hard work, each manager considers their
job a rewarding experience in which they feel
appreciated,“'l‘he guys are just great," said Cogs

NFL draft

A good weekend experi-
ence.7 Not forlordan Kujala.

I have to say that although I am thrilled to
see the Vikings trade for one of the best pass
rushers in the league—something that fills a gi-
ant void—Jared Allen nearly ruined my week
end.

My weekend was almost as big of bust as
Patrick Stefan because I love to watch the NFL
draft, And due to the Allen trade, among oth~
ers, the Vikings only had one pick in the first
four rounds. sure t'm thrilled to have a guy
that claims his mullet is the reason for his suc-
cess, but the draft is so much more unsatis g
when your team has such few picks.

You would probably think I'd be more tips
set that the Vikings gave away too much to the
Chiefs, but the Jaguars basically gave up the
exact same amount of draft picks for Del-rick
Harvey, a defensive end that has never played
a down of professional football and will make
almost the same as Allen. Or that I‘d be more
worried that the star end is only one DU'l away
from a year's suspension. Yes, that is a concern,
but my real reason for not being satisfrcd with
the trade is that it deprived me of an excuse
to sit on the couch for two straight days with
nothing on my mind except football.

I mean, the NFL draft is an oasis in a mostly

uneventful NFL offseason that lasts just slightn
ly longer than the time it takes Frank Thomas
to leg out a triple. It gives you a chance to don
your jersey one last time before fall, and, ifyou’re
ajets fun, it allows you one last opportunity be—
fore the start ofthe season to boo anything from
trading up to pick a tight end, to the Patriots, to
Caleb Campbell,

And, to be quite honest, college football is
not one of my favorite sports, Yes, I do watch
a ﬁiir amount of it, and don’t go a Saturday in
the fall without catching at least one game, but
any sport where Pete Carroll and Steve Spurrier
can be considered geniuses leaves me a bu leery
about fully committing to it.

Luckily, the Draft makes up for not really
paying enough attention to the college game.
Even ifI wanted to, I couldn't watch enough
games to become really all that intelligent on '
many of.thc star players. Especially since four
years of outstanding production can be de-
stroyed by a forty time that would make Mike
Williams cringe. But in just two days, one gloric
olls weekend ofdl‘aft coverage,l can learn about
the next generation of players sure to blow the
rookie salary cap out of the water.

What did I learn? I learned that the Bucs
first round selection, Aqib Talib, comes from
thejosh Howard School ofoff—season workouts
and that the Packers, by selecting Brian Brohm
really want to shake the conﬁdence of Aaron
Rodgers so badly that Brett Favre is forced to
return. I learned that, because of the otherwise
successful Floyd Reese era, the Titans have be-
come so gun shy about taking a wide receiver
high in the draft that given the opportunity
to do their 1998 draft all over again they still
would pass on Randy Moss,

Even with the Vikings having only a few
picks, l was still able to be skeptical of their
seeming predisposition to believe any smokes
screen set by another team. That is, that when
reams ﬂoat false rumois about the player they
are interested in the Vikings tend to bite on
their fake worse than a safety when he’s playing
the Colts.

Despite the fact that the Vikings moved up
twice when they probably didn’t need to, I was
still fairly happy with who w selected, and al-
though i only saw about 75 percent ofthe pro-
ceedings as opposed to my usual 100 pc cnt,I
can say it was still a fantastic wcckcnd.
