Danger, ice

isn't it exhilarating walking around
campus after a fresh snowfall? The
olvel‘whclming presence of white and
that peaceful, post snow quiet should
make any morning walk to ARH a
calming and enjoyable experience And
it would, if we worent all teiritietl of
slipping and breaking our necks. On
Tuesday,students woke up to nblizzard—
rat-aged campus and the sight or our fel-
low Grinneilians inching rci-ritied along
iceacovered sidewalks on their way to
class. Even on holidays, the administra-
tion should ensure that after a blizzard,
walloirays on campus are shoveled, sand—
ed and safe before students start heads
ing to their 8am classes.

SGA commands significant resources on campus
and represents student opinion to administrators and
trustees. Every year we pay $340 as part oia comprcr
hensive fee to enroll at the college, two thirds of which
are contributed to student government. After doing a
