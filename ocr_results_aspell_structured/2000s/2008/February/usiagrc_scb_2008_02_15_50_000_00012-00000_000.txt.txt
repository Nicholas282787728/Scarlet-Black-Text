Students get over themselves, the 100 Days way

Danny Haupt asks why it takes seven and a half semesters for Grinnellians to take the initiative

A hangover, vague fears about mono
and a catchy little mug proe lainlingi
“.08,No limits." All are mementos from
a great night spent with graduating set
iliors at the Elks Club last Saturday,
an event
otherwise
known as
100 Days.

A f t e r
piecing (ct
getlier the
night, it
seems that
Grinncuians are unnecessarily anxious
about transgressing social boundart
ics. Hundred Days proves it might be
easier than we think.

Naturally, 100 Days provokes great
speculation and curiosity Although
theie was Arnbcrbock on tap, the open
space and friend circles initially made
the party feel more like a nrrddle school
dance than the lecherous scene my
imagination had concocted.

But as the lights slowly dimmed and
the beer line petered out, a few eager
individuals started to take the initiative.
What might otherwrse be deemed an
obscene mass maketout session at Har—
ris was now an irrspiratron to others.

Things might start with a shrug
of the shoulders or an awkward smile,
but after five, ten, and for some, even

The implicit rules and ample sup

ticket didn’t contain
explicit guidelines to
navigating the party.
But most otus, based
on stories from past
years, expected air
environment where
there would be no
judgment or conse-
quenees for putting
ourselves out there. I doubt that’s really
possible.

But by buying a ticket and partici~
paling, all ofiis pretended it was. Ifthat

mixed drinks aided

Many wail/d argue {bar 700 Day:
is an anomaly, but what is really
sirange is al/owmg our dill/tries i0

Grinnellians suffer from unreasonable
anxieties is an understatement most
wouldn't challenge,

Oftenuve are told that our concerns
and excessive WOIryIIIg aren’t unique,
that on some level
we all experience
the same fears about
miscominunieation
or rejection. Them
reticaliy that sounds
nicc, but when you're
trying to muster up
the courage just to
say “hey," to somet
one, such advice seems pretty lame.

But at the party, we could see that
the individuals we idealized are actually
susceptible to the same neuroses we are.
This revelation makes one questions
whether 100 Days is just a drunken
night ofdebauchery.

Many would argue that 100 Days is
an anomaly, but what is really strange
is allowing our anxieties to overcomv
plrcate our lives. Instead ofdrawing up
elaborate lrsts for the big night, maybe
it would just be better to take a few
more chances.

It would probably be unliygicnic for
cvcryrvcckcnd to replicate the fcstiuities
last Saturday, but life at Grinnell could
be a lot better ifIve worried a little less
