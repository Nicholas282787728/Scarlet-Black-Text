is Great!

The vegan ar’s (sole?) moment of greatness, Glory

5. Curried Corn and Wild Rice Soup
Less exotic than it sounds. Even though it’s not very
”wild,” we love it for its pretension.

Thundering disappointment

i’r-c lived in Iowa about to years now, and I've
seen my share of ridiculous weather, but when
Steve Briscoe sent me in :-mail telling me to
expect "rhundcr snow,"1 was shocked. Shocked
and ECSTATIC. Iwniecd at day {or my noun
dorblizzai'd, but it never came. VVTF, God? I've
had to deal with .1 lot of crazy weather-related
crap in my day, including that delightful ice
storm last winter, but We gladly put up with it,
because I knew that somedayI would get the 013*
porrunity to see something truly badass. Now, it
seems that chance has come and gone, and I have
been left bcrcft and thunder snow-less Honestly
now, nothing complements the tranquil serenity
afar delicate snowfall like the violent crash of100
million volts coming down to kick the earth’s ass.
IWANNA SEE IT!!

vLi'mouy Dani: ’08

It’s getting hot up here

I’m sorry, but why are the rooms on Loose
third so damn hot? While every other building
makes me freeze,1 can b ’ly breathe when on
Loose third. In fnct, I i on turning on u Em
or opening a window or something to bring the
room temperature down train 100 dcgi-ccs. Global
warming is bad enough but specincrnoor wam‘r
ing? No fair.
