“The hiprhop club that was here when i was
a fiist yeai disappeared when my second year
began so I decided to start rhis,"said Green.

The symposium has generated interest
from many Giinnellians, ranging from those
who want to expand their musical awareness
to seasoned veterans of the
air who would just like to see
more hiprhop on campus. “It
gets overlooked how much this
community listens to hip-hop
and likes it," said Asa \Nildcr
'10. “The support is definitely

hop."

Eclectic music makes for diverse concerts this week

Folkie defies musical,

singerrsongwriter Kazutaka Nomura, also
known as PVVRFL POWER, takes his home-
spun lyrics and elegant acousric guitar playing
to Bob's Un»

Feb. 29.

N o m u r a ,
who formed
his solo act 14
months ago,
brings a trans
national artif
tie and ethnic pedigree to the bardic and folk
music scene, which bridges his background in
classical and jazz guitar and musical composir
tion with his quirky and playfully coy lyrics,

At 18, Nomura emigrated from Hokkaido,
Japan to Seattle, where he studied under the
composer Bern Herbolsheimer.

Since then. he has played high—profile
concerts such as Wham City's Wharfscape
Festival and Seattle's Capitol Hill Block Party
mainstage with acts including spoon and
James Vanderslice. Nomura ended up winning
the capitol Hill Black Star contest, resulting
in one ofhis singles being feanired in an Esurr
ante commciciul.

Despite his formal education and growing
exposure, PWRFL POWER’s songs strike a
conversational tone that rollick in between the
songwriters lighthearredness, innate humor
and honest convictions, -

Music from Sierra Leone
deftly balances the trag—
ic and the celebratory

Moving, exciting and upbeat, sierra Le—
one's Refugee AllrStars will be playing Harris
on March 5, for a concert blending the contra-
dictory forces of tragedy and celebration.

The AllrStars evolved from a meeting be»
tween musmians Reuben Koroma and Francis
Lamgba in a refugee camp in Guinea afrer
ﬂeeing the conﬂict in Sierra Leone.

Sclf~describcd as reggae, Afro-beat and
folk, their music is both inspirational and fun.

it is hard to stay still while listening to Aliyou
are absolutely compelled to dance.

Yet when you listen to then lyrics, rhe sub-
jccts oftheir songs are not always as happy and
peppy and their music suggests.

Crying out against social injustice and the
atiociries of war, they bring their pasts and
polatics to their music, singing, “Why should
the suffering mass/suffer for the ignorance/of
the giear man?"

Theii emotion and ability to use "“1le as
a healing tool is amazing, They have suffered
through so much and yet are still able to not
only function but also create music that in’
spires others.

One might expect them to have harsher,
more jaded music given their histories. But it
is quite the opposite.

They focus instead on positive change, not
n e g a t l v e
pasts. In
fact, their
song, “Live
ing Like a
Refugee,
is ironic in
how much
it under
states the travails ofa refugee, wtth lyrics that
include “Living like a refugee/is not easy/it's
really not easy.”

Not only do they give the audience great
music, but they also are a stellar example for
how music can help people overcome any situ-
ation.

And for something

completely different...

The Chamber Nluslc Society of Lincoln
Center may not inspire inryourrseat dancing
like the Refugee All—Stars or hipster quirkjr
ness like PWRFL POWER, but that's not to
suggest that their concert will be underwhelms
ing in any way.

comparatively quiet, the sinallrscale nae
lure of chamber music (thc name derives from
the tradition ofplaying smaller venues) proinr
iscs an intimate show. The Lincoln Center tag
gniarantees musicians ofrhe highest ability.

Even the most casual of classical music err
thusiasts Wll.l appremate the skill these artists
bring to their

or, for any-
one who can't
distinguish be-
twecn Brahms
and Beethoven,
the show offers
the perfect opportunity to just escape from the
daily grind and enter a dramatic and expressive
world ofﬂutcs and violins.

The concert is this Thursday, March 6 at

available at the Bucksbaum box ofﬁce at noon
