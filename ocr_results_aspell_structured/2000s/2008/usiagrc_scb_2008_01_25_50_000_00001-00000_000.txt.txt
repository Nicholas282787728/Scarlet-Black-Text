Conor McGee ’08, the pubs manager.

The successful health inspection, along

beverages. The physical space is nearly com-
plete, and McGee, three assistant managers
and eleven bartenders, all students, were hired
before winter break.

“This is a particularly exciting time for
the managers because we‘re ﬁnally past the
metaradmmistrative limbo," said McGee in an
email, “From here on out, everything we do
has a direct impact on how the place will feel

Over the winter break, the college hired W.
Houston Dougharty, the current Dean ofStur
dents at Lewis and Clark College, as its new
Vice President of Student Attairs. Dougharty
replaces Torn crady who resigned the position
to become the Dean of the College at Darts
month College.

Dougharty will assume his position in
April as he will finish out the remainder of
Lewis and Clark’s academic year. Over the
coming months he will visit the Grinnell came
pus to meet with students, faculty and admirr
isttators.

Until he officnllly begins, Elena Bernal '94.
currently special assis at to President Russell
K. Osgood for diversity and achievement, will
serve as interim head of Student Affairs,

SGA President Megan Gocring '08, who
was the student representative on the sear-ch
committee, said that Dougharty impressed the
search committee by “describing his number
one job as being an advocate for students."

The search committee interviewed ap-
plicants from around the country and invited
three finalists to come to the college for more
interviews and meetings with students, faculty
and staff. The search committee then submits
ted recommendations to Osgood.

“While there was support for all three of
them, people felt like Houston [Dougharty]

had the best array of experience and was the
most impressive and the most likely to do well,”
Osgood said. “I will say I completely agree.”

Dougharty said he hopes to begin by 115’
tcning to studentconcerns and says thathe has
no “agenda” for change. “I’ve never really found
that coming in with both guns blazing makes
any sense," Dougharty said.

In a past position as associate dean ofsnk
dents at Iowa State University. Dougharty was
outspoken in his advocacy on issues ofsexuitl
orientation and gender identity.

“Vi/hen I first got to Antes, there wasn’t
much conversation around heteroscxisin or
homophobia or doing what we can to cele-
brate and support LGBT and queer students,"
Dougharty said “I was one ofthe ﬁrst admin-
istrators to stand up and say, ‘t ' 's an impor-
tant thing for ISU to embrace.

Doughrtry's efforts were so impressive that
Iowa State's Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisenaral,
Trarrsgcndcr student services now gives out an
annual "w. Houston Dougharty Ally Award.”

At Lewis and Clark, Dougharty oversaw
a restructuring ofthe Student Life office that
college Provost Jane Monnig Atkinson said
“leant coherence to the whole structure and
made it more responsive to the campus."

“We are heartsick that he’s icavmg,”Atkinr
son said. “He's a communityrbuilder who smr
dents, faculty and staffitlike really admire,"
