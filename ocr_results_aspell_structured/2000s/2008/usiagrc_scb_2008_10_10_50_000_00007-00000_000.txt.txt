The Gang Bang Theory

The evolution of Grinnell party culture from the Military Ball to 10/10

1W Tessa CIIFEKANDJAI Gaut:

With the majority ofGrrnncll students planning to wage a

u- on sobriety" this weekend, it’s important to look back and
see how we have evolved from our humble beginnings.

Today's cm of auvthrng-goes self-govermrnce is .i far cry
from the Gi‘inncll so I] sccnc of the 19505.

“Grinncll used to be kind of conscrv vc and buttoncds
down," sirrl Phil King ‘54. King norcd this the college had
“dorm rnothcrs,”whoscjob it was to ensure that female students
not set foot in male rooms except during super _ d vrsiting
hours. Usually elderly womcn, dot-m mothers were intended to
invoke respect due to their age and to protect the chastity of the
Gi'mneil community. “There was a thrcc feel on the floor rule,"
King, d. “Of the two licolvlcﬂiic mile and one female—tn
the room, three out ofthe four [fuel] had to be on the ﬂoor."

The frivolityrfrcc student body was easily frustrated by this
system and was forced to be extra creative when it came to get»
trng their kicks,

“The women had hours. If yolr wcrc a woman student at
Grinnell, you had to be back by a certain hour on the weekends
and they looked the loggta,“ King explained. “so the men would
gather outside the women’s
dorms and veil and scream

pus party that was the loos,

King said that in the nude

'oos “Gtinncll went from the

18905 to the wires in two years—it was .i violenr switch to the
chaos of the '605."

With dorm-specific parties '11 the norm, the campus bee
gan to come together in uninh ited splendor, The seventies
ushered in a previously unimagincd form of dcbiiucheiyithc
james l-lall Gang Bang and the Loose Hall Ball.

Hosted byiamcs Hall, the Gang Bang was an ailsoutdrinks
iug fest that brought together students from all areas ofcampns
for a night of thcrned ridiculousness, The party had a differ—
ent thcmc every year, and students would dress up and rhen
proceed to become inehriatcd, a precursor to today's weekend
Harris cxtravaganzas.

These hallrhosted campus events were marched only by the
madness ofthe early Grinnell Relays, which began in 1972, and
brought together many students—and Wayne Moycr, Polirie
cal science—to participate in full—fledged Olympivsryle beer
drinking.

In an effort to keep up with the '70s, Grinnelliaus ofthe ’805
ushered in several short-lived theme parties which the Cyclone
rcmerubers as Norris Hall’s “Wild Rumpus“, the all—campus,
alissuhstancc “I’cacc Day" and the brrefly fly “T—shiit and Tie"
extravaganza.

Just before the ’805 passed into legendary parry obscurity,
came two allrcampus party gems that continue to rock our-
seeks off: 1988‘s Ma. y Names and 1989's Disco. According to
the 19% Cy clone Disco rs an annual daricc started a fewycars

In the ’90s the current party staple, Harris Center, was con:
srrucred, providing the campus with a castle where Disco and
Mary B. James could reign as kings. But these Harris parties
could not fully quench the thirst ofa new ’90s generation, and
by 1998 the time was ripe for another master-piece party—or
two. 10/10 and Block Party were created rn the same year, ex-
panding party tcrritory from a single venue or hall to the en—
tirety ofcampus or several city blocks.

Of course, not all the festrvrtres Grinnellians enjoy today
stem from the last three decades. While time honored tradi-
tions from the Y40s and 505 such as Homecoming and Mi l-
tary Ball have faded into obscurity, one event has continued to
survive the test of time. “We had two or three formal dances a
year," said Alice McKinney ’52.

one of these formal dances was Grinneil's longest running
all-campus festivity: Waltzr ”The Waltz my senior year was res
ally fantastic," said Former Panry Raider King. “In those days.
all the remnants ofthc big hands would travel the campus cirs
Cultt... [in 1964 wc had Louis Armstrong as the hand."

So this Saturday night, before you start drinking the golden
nectar ofthc 10th annual 10/10, make a toast to all those fallen
warriors who came before.

 

quer-‘r RADERSTRONG
Tbir week: George A. Gates

George Gates only spent 13 years in
Grinnell, but his arrival was an "electric
shock to the balls” of campus, according to
John Nollen's history book, Grime” Co/Iege.

Gates worked as a Congregational pastor
in Upper Montclair, New Jersey before mov-
ing toGrinnell in 1887 to become the second
president efwhar was then called Iowa Col-
lege. His presidency came after the SSsycdt
presidency of George Magoun, and Nollcn
describes the difference between the ﬁrst two
administrations as “a sudden leap from the
past into the future from ﬁxitv to ﬂuidity . .

, the conservative reluctantly passing the torch
to the radical.’

crates, a generation y-ouuger than Mr
goun, was a product of a new breed of relir
gious thought, with more room {or criticism
of dogma and religious scripture. After attends
ing Dartmouth C allege, he wont to Antlovcr
seminary, which he graduated from in 1830.
Arrdover was a place thiit would soon become,
according to Nollcn, the very storm center

of theological controversy in the country be-'

cause ol thc' institutions openness to adi ances
in science and biblical u‘iticism.

Crates was once refused ordination by a
New Hampsh
“subversive rad alism". He had been known to
ask students, “Are you an evolutionist?" before
telling them, “You will never amount to any-
thing until you arc.”

When taking over the presidency cares
did not feel the need to uphold the “profes-
sional dignity" of his office, Nollcn writes'lhal‘
ire had a great sense of humor, and “VHS happy
batting up ﬂies for the ball players in his shirt
sleeves, or coasting: down a hill on his bicycle."

While Gates did not uphold his own pro-
fessional dignity: he had a huge hand in in-
creasing thc academic dignity of the collcge.
Under the Gates administration, the French
and German departments were formed. and
rhe science programs were frilly established. A
radical in the academic sphere, Gates granted
the ditl'ercnr departments autonomy to deter—
mrne meir own educational prior

Perhaps Gatcs’s greatest e
the school was his prime scl
sors. By the end of his presidency, rhe college
had one or the best teaching groups in the en-
tire country,‘ according to Nollcn.

After leaving Grinnell, Gates returned to
preaching for a short time in Cheyennc,Wyo.
before becoming president or Pomona col-
lege in California. He served there for about a
decade, and then moved to Fisk University in‘
Nashville where he spent the last three years
othis lift: Gates died in 1913 at the age mm
and was brought back to Grinnell to be buried
beside his daughter.
