in Perl: KIESELBACII

The Grinnell women's tennis team con-
tinus'd their confeience dominance over fall
break by capturing their fifth consecutive
team title, along with a collection OFlnlelduﬂl
Crowns. Over the break, the Pioneers tiaveled
to Rockford, Illinois, where they captured
the 2008 MWC Conference Clrrr'rnpronshrp
T he win automatically qualiﬁed the squ rd for
the NCAA Tournament held annually in the
spring.

The eharnpionshrp nrareh was an exciting
ﬁnish to a successful season that saw the worm
on go 12-2 during regular season play. “This
season of coaching was one of the most re-
warding eoaehrng experiences for me because
our women worked hard to develop," said
Coach Andy Hamilton '85. “And they would
have not found the highest success without full
engagement,”

In the championship match, the Pioneers
raced ottagainst Lawrence University who ups
set the Grirrnell tearn 4-5 durrrrg the regular
season. Yet going into the final, the women
were far from intimidated.

“I really didn't thi nuch ofit," said Cor
captain Maya Lipert 09 “Because we only
lost 4-5 without our nurrrber one player [Toby
Cain ’12] and thus didn’t play the match with
our top lineup, I knew that when we saw rherrr
later in the season with our full lineup. things
would be much different." The Pioneers won
handedly by a score ofS—l.

In addition to the conference’s team title,
the Grinnell women made history in the con,
ference singles and doubles tournaments. Cos
Captain Katie Colver ‘09 set an M'Vi/C record
by winning 12 championships in four years (4
team, 4 singles, 4 doubles). Not far behind
Colver was Lipert, who concluded her MVVC
career with 11 titles.

“These girls set an incredible standard for
us to live up to and should be given the credit
for our successful seasonrl'Cain said.

tured the singles title at No. S divrsion, while

the No, 3 division.

Because of their tournament win, the
women will participate in NCAATournament
in the spring against other conference winners
around the country

“Usually in the spring a couple ofour line-
up players study abroad,” Colver said. “But this
spring wrll be drtferenr because everyone will

be here. Having the snare team will hopehrlly
help us do well at nationals."

The team should also beneﬁt at nationals
from the contributions of their youngerplayets,
including ﬁrstryears Cain and Sukhatnikova.
Cain is currently plays No. 1 sirrgles,while she
and suklrarnikova play No. 1 dorrbles. This
blend of senior leadership and talented youth
bodes well for success this spring and in the

coming years.

“I think the tournament will be a good op-
portunity for us seniors to have some fun and
play some good tennrs before we graduate,"
Lipert said."And for the underclassrnen, it will
be a good learning erpcriencc that will help
them in their seasons to come."
