(2008)

Preecivilization film timelessly bad

Oh no. Whose idea was it to throw some dreadlocks on
failed fashion model/rock singer Steven Strait and star him in
a movie? The answer is Writer-Director Ronald Emmerich,
who is responsible for such past “gems" as The Dayzl/m- T010017
1-010 and Gar/21110.

While those ﬂicks at least provided a nice excuse to eat
some popcorn and zone out for a few hours, his latest attempt,
10,000 3.0., fails even to do that. It's merely a clumsy, plod-
ding. obvious prehistoric epic that is deserving of immediate
extinction.

Strait stars as D'Leh, a huntergalheter living sometime
atound,well, 10,000 B.C. D’Leh is in love with EVOlcl, brought
to “life” by Camilla Belle, who was just as “impressive" in mm
A Sllnrlger Col/r as a panrcked and very dense babysitter. Why
are the two in love? The movie gives us a moving scene ere
plaining all-

D Leh: Do you see that stir? That one? That light' is like
you in my heart. It will never go away. '

Evolet It will never go away?”

D’Leh: “No, never."

it must be love. She's a ball of gas burning rnside of him
that he can’t get rid of. It's too bad they're living before the age
ofTums.

Evolet isn’t just any girl: she has blue eyes and is part of a
prophecy that promises her to the hunter who can kill a wool-
ly mammoth. The tribe's wise woman, cleverly named Old
Mother, is on hand to make predictions like these while wtith~
ing around in wild hysterics while “speaking with the gods" and
croaking out instructions in a raspy voice. What crazy Old
Mother couldn’t foresee Vms that evil “four-legged demons"
(which will look a lot like Middle Eastern men riding on horse-
back to you) will come and kidnap Evolet.

At Old Mother's annoying insistence, D’Leh rounds up a
few secondary characters to go and track down his woman. Our
companions eventually join forces with some other tribes that
are vaguely African in appearance (the Grass Skirt tribe, the
Face Paint tribe, the Really Nice Pecs tribe. and the Big Mask-
Wearing tribe) to set Evolet and the other captured slaves free.

They‘ve been enslaved by a mean race of cyclineravcaring
desert wanderers, led bya drag queen namedThe Almightywho
favors purple silks, long fingernails, iisping speech, low lighting,
and who wants a pyramid built for l‘llmﬁfol no reason!

weary voice-over narration provided by actor Omar snarit
(who had the good sense not to show his face during the course
of the film), informs us that, “Some truths do not survive the
ages." One ofthe most shocking truths that 101100110 offers
is the frequent use of overethe—top eye makeup by heroes and
villains alike,

10,000 3.0. seems interested in engaging its audrence only
on the most basic level. There's obviously no interest in l'HS’
torrcal accuracyipyiamids being built in 10,000 B.c..> There's
some fun to be had here to be sure—itit had a bit more camp,
it would solidly fall into the “so bad that it's good"eatcgory. it's
just a tad too dull for that, unfortunately,

1fthere's one weekend a year that this ﬁlm can truly be ap
preeiated, however, it's the night of 10/10. Leaving expectae
tions at the door and letting judgment slip a bit is the best place
to start, though it might not be enough.

Camilla Belle (Eric/at) attempt: to estapefram IatrT/iedtmighty m 10 000 B. c. ., tbs Inter: film from directorRenal/1Emmtrr'rlav

ford Harvard Medical School— starts counting cards in Vegas
casinos to rake in some serious cash.

The premise, despite being as old as the hills and utterly
cliched, at least had the potential of being semieentertaining.
But the movie proceeds like a documentary instead of a racy
caper movie.

The conduit to Ben’s journey of counterfeit self-discovery
is a racially ethnically, sexuallyebalanced gang ofother greedy
bright things.Thc most appealing is Choi (Aaron Yoo). as the
kooky, sexless Asian guy, though an equally avaricious math
professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin spacey) runs the group. Using
a system of mnemonic devices, hand signals and a talent for
numbers, the team devrses a way to beat the bank.

The group goes to Vegas. where they count the cards, take
the money and run. Ben also ogles the Chintzy glamour and
the chesty blondes spilling out or their dresses, and the movie
does exactly the same. He particularly likes it when his skinny
school ctusli Jill (Kate Boswoith),c1ambeis aboard and offers
him a lap dance for which I hope the promising young actress
was well compensated,

The movie has so little new to offer that even the seecdllcd
climactic “plot-twist" near the end is predictablc. The perfore
manees are disappointing and the character development non-
existent. By the end ofthe movre, viewers have zero sympathy
for the proverbial, hackneyed caricatures that they are supposed
to root for, if not identify with.

These days a lot otyoung actors are too confidently invested
in the powers of their teenyliop charisma to do a convincing
job ofplaying anyone “normal."Tlrey may look great in tabloid
party photographs, but when they're required to suffer or to
show anxiety—in other words, behave like real peopleitlicy’te
like automatons who’ve taken Fundamentals of Acting to title
fill Humanities reqrrirernents.Thcy turn imperfection into dull
posing Kevin spacey and Lawrence nshburne (as a casino op-
erator) are too talented to do a bad job, brrt they can't save the
movie from the hacks,

srnce everything in the movie can apparently bc bought at
the rrght price, thc filmmakers must have thought about ap»
plying the same pnncrple to audiences- attention spans The
best this rnov has to ol'fcr rs some shots of Veg hrgh lrfc
and a couple of nifty count g scaucnccs In my a on you re
seriouslyl bcttei off doing somethiiw else, own if that tioesnt
rnvolvc you berng 21.

88 Minutes
(2007)

Absurd action flick flops hilariously

OnBTtl‘lll’d of the way into 88 Miriam, a student ofprofes-
sor Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) turns to hrm in a parking garage,
blood down the front ofher face.“This is stupid,"she says.Yes,
aid Minute: is a really stupid movie,

There’s little reason to even mention the student's name
(Lauren Douglas). Though she's played by a usually compe-
tent actress (Leelee Sobieski), she's identical to all ofthe test of
Gramm’s students: young, attractive, and uninteresting.

The people behind 80 Minute; transform every single shred
of competence from their actors and actresses into banality,
Pacino's nearly as irrelevant to the frenetic action as Sobieski,
and he's in nearly every frame of the movie, which is ostensibly
about his own murder (and the graphic murder of women he
has some sort of sexual connection to) but ultimately ends up
being about nothing. It's nothing in the form of talking and
blood and bullets and more talking and an incessant reminder
of how much tune is left before the grand climax, though all
this will remind you of is how much time the movie has l’t’
niovcd from your life (notjust 83 minutes, but 107),

I could hardly forget to mention the gratuitous nudity,
blown-up car, phone calls from someone who sounds exactly
like Jigsaw from the Saw movies, torture, and bizaire sound-
track clioiccsrtanging from the BrickstrcctBoys to Limp Bizkit
to Bubba sparochhis movie is just bad and tht: weird Ethan
Hawke doppelgangct that appears fifty minutes in to add to the
already double digit list of suspects might tip the scales from

“so bad its iinwiitchiible" to so bad its funny" ,

Dnl h rvc to mention that thtrts a prostitute in the mono
nainecl “Sarah Pollard" \ihosc named sounds like “Sarah P. it"
because the characters talk so fa PYes,I do. Do I have to tal in
til st pl: rboii} Vi/ell the chlitactc in SSiVIlrIIl/ur aie self-involved
in the most banal way possible so. vcs.

In the words at Al Pacino' in only the latest of his incredible
r-un ottotil nrtisrrc nilurcs rn rhcl nst decade; Do you have any

idea how absurd that sounds?"
