Hipsters, Muppets and sex (but not all at once)

Cute ’hipster movie’ suc—
ceeds with stellar cast

You want to see this movie. If anything
I've been saying over these past four years has
gotten through to any of you, then you should
just put down this newspaper and get thee to
Harris. flmo is easily one the best movies of
the past year, and it would be a crime for you
to have not seen it. lt‘you’re not convinced on
my word alone, read on.

[two tells the story of sixtecneyeareold Juno
MacGuff (Ellen Page) who becomes pregnant
after having sex with her best fricnd-[lull-boy—
friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael cera). Unable
to go through with an abortion, she decides to
put the forthcoming baby up for adoption to
the young couple Mark and Vanessa Loring
(Jason Batemrn and Jennifer Gamer). The
movie follows Juno’s nine months ofpregnan—
cy all the way up to the birth.

I'm not going to avoid ititliis is a hipster
movie. In the vein of the alsorgrcat Lin/c Mil:
Sum/Jule, fund has a quirky sense of style and
humor. The one-liners come in rapid series, all
ofthe characters are lovcnble in their own little
way, and the scenes How one into another with
no hiccups or hangeups, Additionally, in what
is possibly a first for a teen romance comedy,
the parents (].I(. “Get Me Spidernianl" Sim~
mons and Allison Janney) are actually cool
and funny. Truly, the entire ensemble turns in
a masterful performance, which only goes to
prove what cart be done with the right script
and the right cast.

Well, it's almost the right script (Yeah, I‘m
criticizing an Academy Award-winning script.
Deal with it.) Really though, the slang and li
go employed by the screcnwriter, Diablo Cody,
is sometimes such a blatant attempt to sound
hip alid "with it“ that it falls ﬂat and sounds
ridiculous. I’m no sixteen-yearold girl, but I’ll
eat my hat ifauy ofrhem are saying things like
"honest to blog,"

Keeping to the rest ofthe movie, however,
the music selection is also well done, an eclec-
tic mix ranging from children's songs to indie
to The Kinks. Despite this apparently schizoe
phrenic combination, the songs only serve to
heighten the comedy and the touching mo~
ments. Something about a guy getting dressed
up in jogging gear to the tune of“A Well Re—
spected Mart" just seems so damn right.

Why are you still reading this? You should
be gathering friends to go watch this movie.
Really. Put down the paper. I'm fine with it.
Honest to blog.

pets acting out famous literaniie. There will be
Miss Piggy as Chloe“ Boom Shakalaka. What
.nore could you ask for? seriously, guys 's the
Muppets.

Mapper! Tlmmr friend (1996) relates the
riveting story of Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop),
who sets sail on the Him/mid!” with Captain
Abraham Smollett (Kermit the Frog) and a
shady cast of characters including the menac-
ing cook Long John Silver (Tim Curry),Turns
out, Long John Silver is a rnutinous pirate cape
tain who’s out to get the gold before younglim
who could have guessed?

The ensuing chaos leads the Muppets to
Treasure Island, where they run into a band of
cannihals ruled by Miss Piggy.

Iw‘on’t spoil the ending for you, but suffrce
to say that there are lots of musical numbers,
including the unforgettable “We've Got Cabin
Fever," and the henrt»wrenching "Thete’s Got
to be something Better."

Setting snarkiness aside, I love the Mupe
pets, and this movie features all the classic
chaiacters. Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat accomv
pany our young hero Jim, and sam the Eagle,
as First Mate Samuel Arrow, offers his stoic
comic relief.

The Swedish Chefalso makes a briefcame
co in the cannibal camp (where else?), while
starlet and Waldorf(my favorites) keep a sar—
castic eye on the plot from their position as the
ships figurehead.

At one point, Statler complains about be
ing “Stuck to the front ofthis stupid ship,"and
Waldorfieplies, “It could’ve been worse we
could have been stuck in the audience!" Dc-
spite Waldorf's skepticism, Mapper Ti‘mtllrl'
ltlorrrlis hilarious and delightfully nostalgic.

It'll remind you of the days before your
heart grew cold and jaded, before you were
only able to enjoy the Muppets iionically. Or
at least, it’Ll remind you of the days when you
thought Miss Piggy was really, really cool.

Lady Chatterley
(2 00 7)

Male frontal nudity
and French accents .
don’t save weak mov1e

Lady Cleaner/l}; isn’t an easy mom to love
or even like. ,

It's based on a later draft of the “classic"
DH. Lawrence novel Lady C/mllcl‘lcy’t Low],
which was banned in every country in Eur
rope after its 1928 writing, but of which I’m
convinced (full disclosure: I only read the first
quarter of it and then gave up) would have
justly faded into literary oblivion ifnot for its
notoriously racy content (Lawrence drops a lot
offvbombs and describes a lot ofsex).

The plot is relatively straightforwardwur
lady is going to have sex with the garnekeeper,
her paraplegic husband's going to stirrer and
it’s all going to end badly,

This French movie version, the third ate
tempt to tackle the novel so far, has some of
the same faults of the book. Both are too long
(over two-and-a-half hours for the movie, in-
terminable for the book), with stale characters
and extremely simplistic generalizations about

social class and human nature.

But it also has some of the book's same
virtues: sometimes beautiful evocations of
scenery and at least sometimes lovable, if still
somewhat laughable, flights offancy.

The old English manor and woods in Lady
Chanel-Icy explode in color and light througne
out the movie, and the set pieces inside the
manor have a lavish authenticity It’s PBS
Masterpiece Theatre with new accents (Vic-
torian French, not Victorian English).

some odd editing choices, like strange or
inappropriate fade—outs, don’t detract from the
opulence, though they emphasize how little
the characters seem to matter.

If the lady of the manor (played by Ma-
rina Hands, who also appeared in T12» Dior-rig
Bell and we Brittezﬂy) doesn’t extend a longing
glance for the right about of time, it doesn’t
make much of a difference to the viewer.

the eroticism of the movie: it feels real and in~
nocent and different than crude Hollywood
stereotypes about men and women in bed.
However, running around naked in the rain or
showing extended sequences ofboth male and
ternale frontal nudity (both mostly without
dialogate) do not a movie make.

Less dialogue and a slower pace are some
common differences between American and
foreign art ﬁlms (or at least such characterise
tics apply to the majority of the foreign films
I've seen), but it'the source material's lousy and
the actors and actresses seem like caricatures
of old English sirs and ladies rather than the
real thing, it's notjust a different but simply a
bad movie.

Lady Cballer/ey, despite some interesting
and inventive passages, is both different and
bad.
