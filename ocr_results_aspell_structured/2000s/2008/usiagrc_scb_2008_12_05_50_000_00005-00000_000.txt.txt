Wall-E
(2008)

Pixar film mixes sorrow and
joy in a masterful mixture

\NallrE's been left behind. He‘s a robot—-

Earth classicreated to compact piles oftrasli
on a dcpressingly desolate earth, empty ofl‘lllr
man life and poisoned by pollution.

The year is 2700, and we come to learn that
human beings continued to pollute the Earth,
so much'so that sometime in the 22nd century
they were forced to evacuate. And what we're
left with is a hleakly imagined earth cluttered
with huge mounds ofttash, a rusty brown coin
or scheme, no wildlife or human actionﬂll of

dark and unhappy him.

That couldn't be further tiom the truth.

Wall-E is smalt, touching and funny. Giv-
en its Ptxar pedigree, it's also ambitious and
packed With beautifully created scenes. “Amt
bition" might not even do this film justiceia

robot? “lenderful—but I’m getting ahead of
myself.

from loving him. You've seen titis type heroic,
hoth in the movies, and around Campus: the
dorky but well intentioned with a heart of
gold, slightly ldutzy, has some odd interests,
workaholic type. Wall-E is adorable, and the
ﬁrst half hour gives the audience time ro grow

when we see him watching He/Ie, Do/ryl, his

gins the ﬁlm’s more conventional second half,
as we follow VVall-E and EVE on thei oumey
tluough space, and onto a space ship inhah-
ited by pudgyi doughshaped creature called
humans.

The humans on this space ship spend
their time in motorized recliners, having abattr
doned concepts like exercise or walking long
ago. We have to empathize with these doughy
lumps (they're human, after all), but the basic
question of whether or not they will be able
to return to the place they once called home

becomes more complicated given how they've
treated the earth and their own bodies.

The audience can choose to embrace the
obvious cautionary aspect that underlines
ll/n/FE: ifwe continue polluting our earth, We
will lose it. Yet this isn’t a film that will diSr
tance those uninterested in the message that
the film is advocating, because ital/eecrucial-

ney that the characters take. This is smart and
emotionally engaging nitninaking, and writer
director Andi-cw stanton can take pride in a
job very well done.

Film fest expands the knowledge of Grinnellians

New professor, class challenge students with movies outside the mainstream in new festival

BVJAMESANTHOFER

Most of us can agree that Hell Week is
tough work for the Grinucllian mind. so tak-
ing Saturday and Sunday afternoon off to go
to the “Mind F—k Films Festival” and letting
your mind get some good {wing in before the
week begins is probably just what the doctor
ordered. .

The festival, which starts at 1:30 pm. on
Saturday and Sunday, will include five ﬁlms.
with a discussion and QM after each ﬁlm
led by students from the Film Analysis class,
which has had plenty of experience with ex»
perimental films during the course of the se-
mestet.

The class is taught by Theresa Geller,
English, who was hired last spring as part or
the college's Expanding Knowledge Initiative.
Geller has been excited by the response the
campus has had to the scholarly study of film,

“The festival's part ota larger project 1 have to
bring a more informed academic Conversation
about ﬁlm to the college as a whole," Geller
said. “We all love films, but the ﬁrst ﬁlms
studies class and professor on campus gives
[students] people who have a broader basis of
knowledge around film and its history."

Both times the class has been offered (this
semester and the coming semester) half of
those who preregistered for it have not gotten
in. Geller said she sees the festival as a chance
to give students a view on what the class is
about in practice. “They're all ﬁlms that will

. get you talking,"she said. "You will be thinking

about these films months after you see them."

The ﬁlms were chosen as examples orhow
the realm of visual culture can be expanded
and changed, and also because most of the
ﬁlms can also be analyzed using queer theory,
which some ofthe students will be sure to use.

But, these being mind {7}: ﬁlms, it's more
complicated that that. “It's really interesting
because (the ﬁlm) deals with queer issues in
a very non-binary way,” said Leigh I<unkel,
who is presenting Bang Bang Law, jimmi/eﬂ,
a Japanese film from 2006 set in a surreal juver
nile detention facility. “It doesn’t say this is one
way to be and this is another."

The ﬁlms have many ways of arriving at
their lack of conclusions. They come from
diverse decades and locales, including 19605
France (Lair Year {If Marlene/m9, Soviet-era
Russia (Sm/Kw), and modern Los Angeles
(Millie/1mm Driot). Geller knows that they
may seem “obtuse". “difficult" or even that
deadly buzzword “arty", but feels reassuring
students oftheir cntcrminment value isn't difr
tieult. “I'd would really stress that they're all
incredibly beautiful," Geller said

Hollywood lover, Pat Green ’085. one of the
student presenters, explained this in the con,
text or his movie Sta/tn, a postrupocalyptic
sci-fl movie. “There are a lot oflong landscape
shots," Green said."1t's a very visual movie, and
ifyou’re going to watch a regular movie, you’re
going to be disappointed, but if you’re going
with an open mind,you’ll really enjoy it."

Viewers might also enjoy the food that
Geller, using funds from the Cultural Films
Committee, is bringing to the event. You
might say she’s not only revolutionizing the
way the campus watches movies but what we
eat during them in getting her own groceries.
“I’m sick of Grinnell catering," Geller said. “If
I get one more fruit salad, cheese, and brownie
plate I’m going to throw it at the wall."
