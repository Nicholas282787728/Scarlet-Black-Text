Running for President

lan
Athanasakis ’09

1. First of all, I do
have expelience with
SGA.I have been on a
few committees SpCClﬁ’
cally the Student Tech
nology Advisory come
niittee. I’ve also been on y
the I’loneel One Come
mittee. I’m currently
sitting on the board ofdirectors fol the Mid
west Bisexual Lesbian Gay Transgender Ally
College conference. I have some experience
with management skills.

I think a cool thing about me being a cane
didate is I’m not a US citizen, I’m not a politi»
cal science major.

2. Fllst-year first semestel legistration, I
don't know if you remember but it sucks. [I
would like to have a] Mental healtll review. I
just read an we article with a student com-
plaining about mental health in 2003,1t's been
a publicized problem since 2003.The third
thing is to improve technology on Campus

3. I am too much of an ldeologlsr. I thlnkI
have very strong ideals and 1 think that might
become a problem when something needs to
be discussed or decided upon.

4. I'm not sure we should be calling them
opponents; were all working for the same
put-poseThey're all social science majors. km
a computer science major which means my
brain has been molded in a different way to
get things done in a solutions-oriented way.

1. I'm an Eagle
Scout, which lneans

knowing the right

way to lead.There's two

ways, there’s the guy

who sits there and tells

other people what to do

aiid there’s the guy that .

actively takes an inter-

est in the issues aiid

actually gets involved. And that’s what I was
though the right way to do and that’s how I
dot it.

Here on campus 1 know people in just
about every social scene, in every clique so
I know what I’m talking about when student
affairs come into play.

2. The first one is probably funding. lve
been working in plione—a—tholl so I know what
funding involves. There shouldn’t be a group
that’s denied funding, because it’s there.

Another thing that’s a big deal now is poli-
tics on campus and I don‘t think it’s been dealt
with properly.

Mainly my policy is I replesent the star
tlenrs. I wrll do whatever I can to help any stilt
dent that comes to me with a valid conceln.
That’s basically my entire policy: an open door
policy.

3. Currently, organizational. I've got a file
box and lfl actually have this huge responr
sibility where I have to kecp track of lots of
things I need to have a decent filing system
aiid keep track ofall things that students are
coming to me with.

4.1m your average guy. I’ll hang out and
talk to you, My friends know that, ifyou need
me to be serious, I can be serious; if you need
me to be funny, I can be funny. I’m there to
listen.

Greg Hudson ’09

1. Well, I've had two
teims as an SGA senar
tor form Clangrala. l‘ve
served on the Student
Technology Advisory,
the Student Plogrrllw
ntlng and Reform
Committc s, It gives
you a personal ltlnllolr
ship with a lot of people
in SGA that when you're outside ofSGA you
don’t really have,

I’m currently leading an AltBreak trip.
This has really tested and honed my abilities
to manage contacts and holding meetings and
just getting things done in genelal.

2. My first priority would be to redesign
the campus website. The web is supposed to
make things easier, but our website makes
things more difficult.

The second thing is reducing energy con-
sumption. I’m a firm believer that we can both
save money and decrease our impact on the
environment at the same time. One simple so-
lution is to just mm ofthe lights in the dining
hall at nightThey're really unnecessary.

Iwould like more money going to the stu-
dent Programming committee and STIFund.

3.1 have a tendency to bite off more than
I can chew fairly often. And because of that I
need robe really sure that I'm pursuing a liin-
ircd number ofthings.

4. I have more experience than they do.
Two tctms isn't a lot but it's enough to get you
familiarized with the process and the context.

VP of Student Affairs
John Burrows ’10

 

1. The experience
I've gotten in Joint
Board over this past
year and also the intctr
action I have with sews
ctal different student
groupsi have tried to
extend myself to many
people across campus.

I've tried to throw
events that improve student wellness that is
one of my big projects.

I know Sheree Andrews and Michael Sims
really well from throwing Harris atleast a half
dozen times and serving on committees with

Jen Ktohn.

I will know which avenues to bring about
change with my es-pcricnce serving on diff
committees, being transportation,NSO, ACE.
student council on curriculum.

2. Improving student wcllness, fighting for
student rights and enhancing SGA and srtk
dent body interact n

Under that. expanding rnental hcalth re
sources for students and fighting for student
rights, advocating for more money for student
groups.

I would also like to educate students about
their legal rights are knowing what your
rights are, knowingwhat it means to go school
[at a place like Grinnell].

3. Bringing about change on campus is a
very bureaucratic process and 1 might get eas-
ily frustrated having to work within that bu-
reaucracy to bring about change.

4. I would say the experience that i’ve had
dealing with administrators in student attairs
and also interacting with all different types of
students on campus and being exposed to the
many difterenr needs otstudents.

Net) Morake ’09

i. I'm very peasant
able. I'm very approach
able. I'm very open to
listening to rvhatpcoplc
have to say. l'vc been on
student stal'ffor the last
run years. And I would
like to apply to create
community throughout ‘

the cntrrc campus.

I'm also currently the Grllincll Posse Intern
and , . I've been working with [Interim Vice
President for Student Affairs] Elena Bernal
and l‘vc been working closely with [incoming
Vice President for Student Affairs] Houston
[Doughatty].

2. One major thing I would really like to
accomplishillke my initiative that passediis
diversifying the curriculum. My second one
would be creating more gender diversity on
campus. Another issue . is just walking on
the oflrcampus living application process. It's
messed up that some seniors can‘t live offcam-
pus until second semester.

3. I have no idea about what goes on with
the budget. I’ve been talking to senators and
Megan [Goering] has been able to answer
questions, So I’ve been talking to people about
the budget and what I would have to do.

4. I would say the been able to connect
with various groups of students on campus.
Just with my positive and high—energy person—
ality people are more [Likely] to vote for me.

Schneider ’09

1. I consider myself
extremely outgoing. I'm
just really receptive to
everybody and I like
to he a broad array of
ideas iln(l ensure that
I’m given as many sugr
gcstlons as possible.

I've been an SA for
two years. After the 1" year I assumed quite a
substantial role in the SA process, participate
mg a lot in naming, leading a couple ofactivir
rres both by myselfand in a grorrp and present
mg to new SAs what the role ofan SA is.

2.I would like to see more ofa commur
nity fecl Within the school. I would like to see
.. , committees responding more to each other
and listening to each other.

I'm interested in ensuring that the corn
tnirrccs are given pl‘opct funding as well as
proper advoc ,

A third issue would be a rtkindling ofself-
governance to best utilize the school's ability
and unique atmosphere to ensure that all star
dents are treated as equals and are given the
same opportunities,

3.1 would say my biggest weakness will be
removing myself from ssues 1 feel strongly
about, While I am willing to listen to others
and respond well there are certain issues that
I have firm beliefs in alld I would like to see
changes implemented.

4. My ability to work \chI with others. I
understand that what] think is not necessarily
correct and I'm willing to listen to others and
see how they feel and work within a commu—
nity to resolve rhese issues in a way that will
help affect the gleater community.

1. 1m a sophomore
now. I don't want to
worry about taking care
of the student body
and worry about what 1
want to do with the lest
of my life.

I have two semesteis
in SSA You should at least have experience
with SGA ifyou’re going to work with it.

2.1 will open SGA up to more student
participation and so in terms of that l have a
bunch ofldeas. Every other Joint Board start»
ing at 6:30 with the plesident and vice presi-
dents and a session so students can come in
and talk to them without having to worry
about parliamentary procedure or anything.

I'm going to work to keep the student ini-
tiatives process going. Its going strong now
and there’s more participation than ever and
that’s what I want to keep goliig.

This is kind ofa take off of the first one
and that's to change joint board and really
make it mole accessible to people.

3. I think my weakness is I’m not familiar
with a lot of the oiganization on campus that
are leally important like StoneCo or some di»
versity organizations.

4. Diversity of experience. I feel like a lot
ofcandidates have experience in SGA. . .. Burl
also know what it's like to be a student athlete
and to have wolked on the Cyclone.

VP of Academic Affairs
Julie Hoye ’10

1. In terms of ex
perience, 1 have been
a senatol now fol two
semestels. It lets me
know how thing are
happening, such as in
Student Health alld
Wellness Committee.

[particularly] through
committees.

Last semestel I was in the academic 5|le
group, which got me furthel into the issues [of
Academics].I haven’t served on the Academic
committees, hilt I have alranged with the Cur
rent Vice Plesident of Academic Affairs to sit
in on them.

2. I want to look at the ways they evaluate
advisor training. I rarely hear people say there
advisor is really goodl don't think [many advir
tors] understand certain typcs ofcurriculurn.

I think student input is very irnporranr in
academics. I think people are more comfort
able taking about it over lunch than through
an onlinc survey and getting faculty involved
in the dialogue.

Iwould be able to do more in getting classr
cs offered more frequently, working with the
registrar and dcparuncnt chairs,

3.1 get really wrapped in things, which is
really negative when it comes to playing stupid
computer games, but it can be a good thing
when I am writing a paper.

4. I get really passionate about academics.
Because I think that's the rcal reason we’re
here. I think that I can communicate very well
both with faculty and people in higher posi-
tions and I think that's a really important as-
pect ofpeople in cabinet, ‘
