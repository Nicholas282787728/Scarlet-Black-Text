Mortgage and financial crises deepen causing consumers to spend less at Grinnell—area businesses

BVJUSTIN ERICKSON

Over the past seveial months, the national economy has
faced severe strain and the College has felt the effects ofa tut-
bulent stock market as attested to by President Russell K. Osa
good's letter on impending budget stringency. Yet to Grinncll
residents outside the college, economic recession means more
than bailouts and cuts in department budgets.

As financial haidships continue, Grinnell businesses are be-
ginning to feel strained by the economic downturn, especially
those that provide more expensive goods. When income tier
clines, consumers' demand for “superior goods" decline while
the demand for “inferior goods" increases. Grinnell consumers
with strained checkbooks are readily attesting to this maxim.

According to JeffPhelps '73, the owner ofSaints Rest cof-
fee shop, pations have been purchasing less expensive sources
of caffeine, Despite a mere 2 percent decrease in the number
of Saints Rests’ patrons, overall revenue dropped 12 percent in
September.

"People are still coming in, but they’re buying a lot marc
regular coffee than they used to," Phelps said. ”Instead of a
latte, they’ll buy a iegular coffee or get a smaller cup."

Across town, the owner of the local Ford dealership, Steve
Link, said that while his busmess was in good shape, there have
been fewer casual customers and more inquiries for used cars.
“Although foot traffic is still down, we're not down in sales,"
said Link. “The car-buyers who are coming in now know they
can afford it.”

But sales of luxury goods in: not the only items to be af—
fected by the economic contraction, A few blocks away from
the dealership, Randy Smith, the owner of McNally’s grocery
store, described his business as suffering not only from cus
tomers downgrading, but also from an increase in commercial
competition.

“Wal-lVlart came down with the superccnter two years ago
and we’re still feeling that effect,” Smith said. “So although
this recession is just getting started, we've been going through
tougher times because ofcompetition.”

Smith said the recent downturn has already translated into
a decline in jobs, with more cuts potentially on the way, Smith
said declining revenue has forced him to cutback on his part»
time positions and completely eliminate one full-time employ-
ee.

WalrMart was not the only national chain discussed by 10,
cal business owners, Since restaurants are one of the first sectors
of the economy to feel the downturn. consumers often replace
dinners at local establishments with fast food.

“McDonald's seems well positioned for recession,"said Mc-
Donald’s CEO Jim Skinner in a recent inrerviewwirh Reuters.
“In bad times, people think twice about where to spend money
when going out for food." Consequently, local uprscale res-

taurants Phoenix Cafe and the Depot crossing have seen the
volume of diners decline over recent months.

To entice more customers. Kamal Hommoudu, owner of
the Phoenix, will begin implementing new strategies to come
bat the effects oftlie recession. This winter they will provide
15 percent discount coupons on Faraway receipts, according to
Hominoudu.

The Depot has begun to cater to different groups as the
number of regular diners has diminished. “We’ve seen a den
create in regular dining services," said Don Schrack, the Des
pot's General Manager, “But we’ve seen an increase in private

parties from places like the college. which has minimized the
impact ofrhc recession.”

The restaurant beneﬁted heavily from the recent cross-
coiintry meet in Grinnell as a number of teams dined at The
Depot over the weekend. .

According to all the business owners interviewed, they plan
on weathering out the storm and generally maintaining cur
rent business practices. “I’m not going to change the quality of
my ingredients," Hommoudu said. “I'll ride it out and for as
long as I have my health. I can't see leaving in the foreseeable
future.”

 

Hade

from p. 1 “He was just so polite, It seems like a metar
phor for his whole experience—other people
could be belligerent or diﬂicult, and Chris
was just be nice the whole time."

Hade’s benefit concert will take place Saturday, Nov. 29
in the Indianola High School auditorium, where Hade often
performed while in high school.The Hades provided Licks
iss with a list of possible performers, including high school
friends, local college professors, and members of the Des
Moines Metro opera.

“Once this idea started to take root, it was amazing to see
how many people wanted to help out.” said Natti Tlpnyil‘
mongkol '08, who has dated Hadc since they met in high
school five and a halfycars ago. "A committee offamily and
friends formed, and we met every couple ofwecks to figure
out the details.”

The concert will not be ticketed, but the organizers are
asking guests for a freeivill donation to beneﬁt Hade’s treat—
ment. Friends who cannot attend can still donate to the
Chris Hade Beneﬁt Fund through State Community Bank
in Indianola.

"It’s it tough situation to be in, but we think it’ll be a
wonderful concert,” Lickiss said. “We hope that Gtinnell
students, if they can‘t come back to school a day early, can
donate to the fund in some way. Grinnell is very special to
Chris."

Schneider and Tipuyarnongkol said that this affection is
recipiocaled.Tlicy welcome other Grinnellians to attend the
concert, particularly those who plan to stay over the Thanks-
giving weekend.

“I know that Chris wishes he could be back at Grinnell
more than anything,"Tipayamongkol said, “He is his same
old self, and I would urge Grinnell'tans to keep in touch with
him."

 

 

 

Budget

from p. 1

further.

“We do expect student family need to
go up," Sortor said. "So that means were going to have to
put more into financial aid and we're getting fewer revenues
through tuition,"

make up about half of the revenues for the
College’s operating budget, with 30 percent
coming from tuition and 20 percent from
other sources, such as private groups.

Sortor said not increasing tuition beyond
standard cost of living adjustments remains a
priority for the College. “[But] can we stick
to that? I don‘t know yet," Sortor said. “It‘s
too early. But you can be assured that the Budget Steering
Committee will be thinking hard and discussing that otteu.
sively ifthat does turn out to be a necessary option."

“lax said that student organizations, which draw funds
from the SGA budget and the Student Publications and Ra-
dio Committee (SPARC) budget are not faci ecrenses be
cause those funds come from the student dct es fccia fee
paid by students each semester.

To reduce spending, Osgood said certain projects, like
purchasing furniture for the new PEC,will be simply delayed.
He said the construction of the gym will continue due to con
tractual obligations, while the potential library renovation,
among other construction projects, will be delayed further.

Osgood also said the filling of empty staff positions will
be delayed.

“We'll go slow on filling staff positions and faculty posi-
tions, but I don’t see a lot of cuts [of staff or faculty posit
tions]," Osgood said, “Now ifwe have to, we’ll cut some, but
I don’t foresee that."

No administrator could give concrete projections about

budgetary restrictions, as the global economy continues to

ﬂuctuate and the exact value of the endowment is unknown.

Osgood said next year’s budget may not ht: finalized until

April, while the budgetary process usually ends in December
or January

“I think we need to be prepared that this
[crisis] could be longer than things we’ve seen
before," said Treasurer David Clay, another
member ofrhe Budget Steering Committee.

Clay said he thinks the College's invest»
incur stmtegy—placing large amounts of in-
vestment into a small number of companies
with high long-term growth polellflaliwlll
eventually stabilize the college's ﬁnances.

“We have companies that we own that are worth less today
in the public market," Clay said. “But they aie companies that
we think will be fine over the long term and not create
permanent losses

To help prioritize budget decisions, administrators are re
questing input from all members of the campus community.
Sortor said the diiectors of the major 0fﬁC¢57lilke Dining
Services and Facilities Nlanagementiwill offer suggestions
to the Budget Steering Committee about areas for savings.

VVax said she will encourage students to contact her with
their concerns so she can present them to the committee.

While there will be a tightening of spending on campus,
no administrators think it will turn into large cuts across the
board. Both Clay and Osgood said the historical ﬁscal conscr-
vativeness ofthe College helped the campus prepare for this
economic downturn.

“There are two ways to deal with something like this,”0sr
good said. “One way is to get real dramatic and say we're going
to cut at, right up front. What we try to do is move forward
and be disciplined at every step of the way."
