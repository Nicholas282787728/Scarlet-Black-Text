ABACUSES: The old-school counting device is really great and is avail—
able in many different colors, but unfortunately they are out-dated and
too difficult to use on a regular basis.

 

 

 

 

THE ECONOMY: We might as well acknowledge the fact that the
country’s current finanacial situation looks pretty bleak. It sucks.

Dear hipster first-years

Stop trying so damn hard. I mean it. I don‘t
give n shit if you are interested in avdnbgardc
sculpture, or record your own electronic music.
You don’t need in explain to me who Broken Sor
eini Scene or Sigur Ros are as if rhey are neariy
unknown, groundbreaking bands; I've heard of
them. 1 know I'm a senior, and perhaps talking
to me or other members of the class of 2009
can be a hit intimidating, but we are NOT our
to get you. we WANT to like you. Well, most
of us do. Essendniiy, running your meraphorieri
indie-cred peacock feathers and parading them
around does not impress me. I will like you be:-
rer ifyou are more relaxed, even ifyau sernrrinirs
say something uninformed or stupid.

RSr Thisdocs not include my wonderful
Loose Deuce first years.

Drug show was too crowded

I was really excoted for the Drag Show extraw
:ganza based on my experience in past years, and
I walked inro Han-is to ﬁnd ir completely packed.
Ivnrs forced to stuncl in the bu ' against the “’3“
while the show went on. My View was blocked
by people's lieiids,and1 had ro srand even though
my legs were exhausted from a swim meet. 1 just
wanted ro support QPOC and rheir cause, our
instead 1 was surrounded by some drunk girls and
ended up leaving after hairnn hour.
