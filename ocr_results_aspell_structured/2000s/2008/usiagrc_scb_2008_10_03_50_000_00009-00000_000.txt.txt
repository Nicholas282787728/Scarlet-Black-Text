Attack Of the giant asparagus

The adventure of the exciting new plant species discovered by David Campbell

iiv CHRIS HlLDELlllAND

In the seemingly innocent greenhouse
above Noyce, an alien life form is currently
reaching its reproductive peak, preparing to
sprour an army that will no doubt have this
campus under control before you can say “as-
paragus", Okay, so maybe there is no alien
in the greenhouse, but there is a really weird
plant there, and when you see it you will say
“asparagus.”

The alien in question is actually a rare,
unknown species of the ﬂgnw plant which
was discovered in the Amazon by David
Campbell, Biology, The plant, which Camp—
bell has had for 28 years, is unique because
of its specialized method of reproduction,
although at ﬁrst glance it is striking mostly
because it resembles a giant asparagus.

While the plant looks like something out
ofn science tiction novel, the story ofits dis
covery is more lndiana Jones than stanars,
Campbell discovered the plant in 1980 while
on an expedition to the Brazilian Amazon
His trip bcg an on the Big Bend of the Rio
Xingu, a southern tributary of the Amazon,
and culminated in O Descrto, an encamp-
ment in the forest.

At one point during rhc thrCCewcck t‘ore
est survey, Campbell experienced what he
called “one of the more

harrowing experiences of lh/Spaﬂl/S extraordinary

my life there, when he
came extremely close to

stepping on a Bushmaster,

the so—cailed “kiss your ass

goodbye viper," campbcu said.

Luckily for Campbell, his trip corree
sponded wirh the reproductive event oc»
curring now, which involves the incredible
growth of the plant, causing it to resemble a
giant asparagus~like stalk. “They were quite
conspicuous," Campbell said.

With the expedition discovering four
or five new species a day, the plants did not
seem to be that exciting a ﬁnd, but Cnmpr
bell still collected some to bring back to the

states. "All you had to do was just rattle the
Stalkishake it—and these things would rain
down on you," Campbell said. “I collected a
few of them, living, and took them back with
me to New York."

Now, 28 years later, one of the descendants
of Campbell's original plant is gearing up to
make babies or” its own. Erik Mottl, the techr
nical assistant for the Biology department,
said the plant has been growing at a rate of
"eight to ten inches a day {or about the past
two weeks.” The plant, which now measures
over 10 feet tall and is restricted by the height
of the greenhouse, has started to curl around
at the top.

This particular plant, which is much big-
ger than the others Campbell has,will produce
ilowcrs, which Campbell can then collect and
use to pollinate the stamens of other ”gum
plants. “I’m pollinating it with itself." Campr
bell said. “It’s like that Woody Allen jokkit's
like sex with somebody you level"

While,unlike humans, the plant can rcprtr
duce with itself, like humans, it does give live
birth. The babies will geiminale on the stalk of
their parent. and when they are ready to grow
on their own, they wrll fall out at the slight
est shake. They already have roots, you yusr
take one and stick it in the soil, and the whole
process starts over again,"
Campbell said.

With most plants,
young seedlings need to
take root far from their
parent plant in order to
have a reasonable chance of survival, Agar/1
seedlings, however, does not have tins prob
lem. The plant is monocarpic, meaning that
the parent plant dies in the process of repme
duction, leaving its body behind to provide
resources for its young.

“This patent is going to give up its body,
and rot, and provide a resource bonanza for
its baby," Campbell said. “In many ways, this
plant is extraordinary, and probably unlike any
other plant most students have seen."

While Campbell will eventually be offi-
cially credited wrth discovering tlre’spccics,
the taxonomists have not yet identiﬁed the
particular species otagaoz plant. The agree is
a very big genus, but they are rare in North
America. some species are used to create sisal
rope, and others are used in the production
of tequila.

Despire rheir rarity, the plants are very to
bust and are easy to take care of. "Students are
welcome to have some itthey want,” Camps
bell said. A loWernaintenanee plant that can
be used to make alcohol? I can't imagine any
Grinnellrans wanting one of those.
