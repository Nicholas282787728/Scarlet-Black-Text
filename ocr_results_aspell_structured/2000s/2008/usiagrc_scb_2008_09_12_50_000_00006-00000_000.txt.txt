Freesound faces, overcomes problems

BY Ci IRIS Davis

Fi'oin Music Hails to thc Norris basement and Harris Ccnr
to stage, and finally to the old Grab-and-Go space in Gaidncr
Loungeithe creation of a place for campus hands to co
tendy practice has been a slow and often contcntiorrs process.

This summer, the conflict continued when the space was
taken away and given back r the course ofa little over a month.
Tire administration and the campus group Freesound (which
nlns the space, organizes concerts for local bands and records a
CD ofbands each year) agreed on a temporary compromise to
keep the space in Gardner Lounge. Futon , Freesound decrded
to create an initiative to solve the dispute once and for all.

Freesound has been the only group for campus bands since
its inception nine years ago, when it received funding for a lim-
ited amount of music gear and a PA system, However, it hadn‘t
been a large force on campus since then because the equipment
was often stored in near-inaccessible locations, none of which
\VM’E as Convenient as Gardner Lounge, “Freesound was kind of
inactive fora long time, because we drdn't really have a proper
practice space," said Mike Kobet '10, one of the two leadeis of
the group.

Chris Farstqd '0‘), the other lcadcr, hclicvcd that the Pl"
trcc space was vital to the increase in the activity of campus
bands last year. “h’ly last semester was one of the best semesters
I've ever [had] at this school because ottirar practice space," he
said.

The students had believed by the end of last year that the
space would remain permanent, but Marci sortor, vice presir
dent for Institutional Planning, announced via e-marl in early

August that the practice space would no longer be available for
student use and that the Harris Center stage would replace it.
The music gear was moved out oi‘Gardncr and nm the CCIKCI
soon afterwards. Tire icasons circd by rhc ndmmistmtrorr in-
cluded rntcrfercnce with campus events and the need to utilize
office space in Main Hall.

on Sept 1, several members of the Freesound community
met with SGA otI‘icnils to discuss tlic SituationThe problems
of the Gardner space were discussed along with the tentative
plan for a new agreement.

Freesound framed the
issue in terms otseif-gover-
mince. “With the policy of
sclfrgoveruance. I don't see
why we couldn't work this
out ouisclvcs,” K0th said.

Sortor and the rest of
the administration cmphfi-
sized the distractions that a
practice space rvorrid create
for the new planned offices
in Mam. but also rccogn .tti
the r rp rtarrcc of music n
campus. “We have to real e
that we are lrvrng and “'0th
mg in a community, in a
constrained space, and there
are going to be points where you‘re either going to have to coin-
prornise or be makmg accommodations." she said, “Obviously.

the musrcal conrmunrty here at Grrnneil College is really vir
brunt, it's excrtmg, and it's a good thing, so we want to con noc
to foster that "

Tire group and adminrstration agreed to allow the storage
orequrpmcut and even g performances to occur in Gardner,
whrie reiegnting daytime practice to Harris.

Freesound plans to continue its efforts to get the practice
spncc back to the way rr was last yearThe group will propose a
student initiative to soundprooftlre Gardner practice room to
make it more readily available However, admmrstrntron stated
that any resulting change in policy
would hinge upon the degree of
sound reduction that was achieved.

\Nith those steps, Freesound
looks forward to expanding upon
the strong presence they cstalk
lishcd last year Lasryear, ti re group
produced two El’s for campus
musicians Tins y r , they plan
to acquiie addrrionai recording
crprrpmertt and rrrn the group lrke
a small record label, with a greater
emphasis on bringing bands to the
forefront

The first Frccsound show ofrhc
ycai is tentatively set for Sept 27,
but bands wrli Likely be performing
in the space most nights before that,

Did on make the piece speciﬁcally for the
compcti on and do you plan to continue in this
direction?

I didl kind oflikc to have purpose or a reason
to make artwork I was trying to base it offworlt I'vc
done before. I've done a large installation with tape-
it went all around the room Only 27D work was allowed, so I
was trying to frgure out another wayl could send something
that was true, what I was enjoying doing, but make it into dif-
ferent forms.”

How do you like to get information [for your an]?

Art meets life:

This summer, while stuck in traffrc back home in Beaverton,
Oregon. a high school friend ofrninc in the passenger seat did
something completely unexpected, The moment the car came
to a full stop, ire hopped out or my dad's SUV, ran across a lane
ofttaffic and gmbbed a dusty, rolled-up car dealership sign that
was sitting on the side ofthe road.

“Pre-owncd,"it declared in bold black and rcd writing.

Stunned, I stated at him from the drivci's seat as he hopped
back into the carr“\’\7hat the hell was that?” asked

“That,"l learned, was part of an “assignment" that lic was
working on for Lml mg to Law Yall More, a multimedia, web-
bnsed art project that receives posts by artrenthusiasts and irrr
rernet-goers around the world.

Altists Miiltnda July and I’lancll Fletcher cicated Li't’l/‘HT
l'llg la Lot/u You Malc in 2002, and enlisted friend Yuri Ono to
design the website, July and Fletcher post srmpic but speciﬁc
ussrgnments on therr website. Participants accept projects, and
submit responses to the wide varicty ofassignments which are
lalet posrcd on the site.

My friend. it turns out, was working on assignment #63:
Maire an encouraging bdnncrr

There are currently 68 assignments posted onlinc. Among
my personal favorites: take a picture ofstrangers holding hands,
grow a garden in an unexpected spot, and reread your favorite

I have a pretty good imagination. so I tend to be out in my
own world anyway. I try to cultivate that. I feel like it's a part of
myself. I just feel like I can make u lot oflinks in my mind when
I can just ttail ofE For instance, when I was tryrng to think of
ways to scale out my three-dimensional drawings, that was very
fun for me because I could think ofconncctions, think of things
that made it the same in my mind.

What about the politics of sponsoring dis—
abilities as something unique to artists?

With this show having a very speciﬁc mes
sage, you use artwork as a way to express yourself,
and you see it as a very vrabie form to build cow
fidence, to build on, to find a career. This organic
zation [which sponsored the event] has a whole
website dedicated to ltitists with disabilities, a
registry, poster art to print out. Even beyond the
disability, they’ve grven a launching pad. I’m very
excited about the passion and to talk to students about what
their art interests wcrcr Some oftis have never talked to artists
with a disability—we always felt we were the only one. It was
very nice to talk to someone with an optimistic View All of
these artists had very optrmistie attitudes

Will you bi: producing more art this year?

A

book from fifth grade,
Normally skeptrcal about any sort otinternet/biog art,1 was
surprised by how quickly this particular website won me over,
It intrigued me from the get-go for a number ofreaso .
The first, probably, is the tart that I was honestly interested
in seeing what sort of responses people would have to the use

signments. I wanted to listen to phone conversations that other
people wanted to have, see what a ﬂash photograph under a bed
might reveal, and know what sort ofstrangers were conuinccd
to hold hands in the name of art,

I also felt inspired by the accessibility factor. All too often,
art that is hung, framed and surrounded by adamant “Do Not
Touch"signs seems separate from real life. I thought it was rc-
frcshing to see people committing to these projects, carrying
our simple but meaningful tasks, and posting them online for
others to see. Moreover, Learning la Loire Ymi Mm assignments

Thrs fail I’m not taking any art classes, hoprng to catch up
on other classes. This spring I'm taking a MAP as well as one
other advanced art class. It's good for me to focus, to have one
thing I’m working on. but I always doodle, so I always make
new things.

can be completed almost anywhere, from Beaverton, Oregon
to Grinnell, Iowa The fact that there are so few boundaries to
creativity and community is really encouraging.

But I think the thing that I liked most about bowing to
Law You More is how honest it is. People all around the world
are raking ﬂash photos underneath their beds, writing out lifc
stones over the course of a day and putting them onirne to
share with othersThcrc is somcthing so sinccrc in this that I—
cynicai iind old~fashioned as I might have been about inrcrrret
.Itti ound it irnpossrble to resist The opportunity to re]:
others n this way comes rarely and never ceascs to be etc

In the word of Lmlllillg/cLaw Yallees creators, The
best rlit and writing is almost llkC an assignment, it is so vibrant
that you feel compelled to make something m response. Sud-
dcnly it is clear what you have to do. For a brief moment it
seems wonderfully easy to live and love and create breathtaking
things,"

Finding beauty in simple dctails is the life of this project,
The way that the projects are presented, the feelings they ins
spire and the actual projects are refreshmg and worth a look or
