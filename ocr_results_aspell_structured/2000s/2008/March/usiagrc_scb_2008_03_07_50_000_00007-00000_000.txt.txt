Laughs, but not

Concert review last Saturday, Jean-Grae put on a fun
show, but musrc (or lack thereof) disappomted

Excitement began to build around campus last weekas more
and more people discovered and anticipated the controversial
arrival of Jean Grae, a smart, politically sawy artist, calling her»
self“the Correta Scott King of my generation. " However, when
she did arrive, 40 minutes late, and began her show, I, for one,
was disappointed.

The biggest problem I had with the show was that while
Grae entertained, she did not engage me in
the deeper issues which inform much ofher
work: The one thing she did stress was put-
chasing hip-hop rather than downloading
it. While that is reasonable, it should not
have been the main point.

Perhaps Grae did not raise issues, be-
cause she didn’t perform many songs. It
seemed hke she performed ﬁve songs in an hour and a half set.
That is one song every is minutes,

The most redeeming part or the performance was Grae's
comedy bit on the worst hipehep lyrics or all time. Whether
telling Dr. Dre to put his beeper on vibrate while “creepin’,”
or pointing out that “Good Mornin’” should not be rhymed

with “valedictorian,” Jean was hilarious. Her wit ms present
throughout the concert, poking fun at beliigerenrs, Kum and
Go and Nick West 083 haircut. While Grae’s tone may have
been harsh, her roasting of hip-hop greats and Grinneiiians
kept me laughing.

some or the problems, especially with sound quality, were
out of her control, Because Grinnell doesn’t own CDJs (digital
turntables) or all of the equipment nec-
essary to use Vinyl, Crazy DJ Bazatro
had to use iTunes to mix the concert,
which undoubtedly took away from the
concerts pacing. And may have been the
reason that she didn't have instrumental
tracks.

The vast expanse that is Harris also
detracted from the intimacy orthc concert. The crowd orape
proximately 150 gathered closely in front ofthe stage, trying (0
imitate a Gardner show, but all that hardwood did not comple-
mcnt Grac’s personal style,

While she gave a few laughs, Gme missed the point.

The Department of’lheater and Dance’s spring semester’s
muinstagc production, VIIIifI/iirrngnilali, directed by Elizabeth
Bonjean,Thcatre, is a contemporary comic drama that presents
the audience with a rclatuble and relevant look at familial and
social dysfunction,

The plot of the play follows Marion’s (Gillian Hcmme
’10) mrbulcnt rcl iships, both internal and external, in her
suburban all s prep school and her pnrgntorinl home life.
Whether it is living with the stigma orhnving a scholarship at
her prep school or attempting to ﬁnd a space to simply exist
and express hcrsell, Marion finds littlc solace at home and, as a
response to the pressures around her, has stopped eating.

While Marion's eating disotthi represents n motir within
the play, the problem isn't central and addresses a larger hunger
rind emptiness that speaks to the emotional paralysis rind rruse
tration ofeach character, both major and minor.

“1 see ‘Vanishing‘as a verb in the title, not an adjective. 1
see it as Marion choosing to internalize the things going on
around her," Hennnc said.“Shc's going through a lot orthings,
in school and at home, and she can’t quite deal with it at all.”

Mirir‘r/zing Mm'wn slides back and forth between the sets
rings or school and home, but the two places share the same
stage, compressed into an apt visual representation ofMarion's
world. Her family includes her devil—may-care twin brother,
Brian (Orion Wingﬁeld '10), their aloof mother, Rita (Kathe?
int: Jarvis ’09), and Leslie (Renee Lynch ’08), their highestrung
elder sister, who recently moved back home after a break-up.
All these characters fail to communicate or truly understand
each other’s grief, stemming from the death of their father ten
years earlier,

“The father died ten years ago, and rho family never dealt
with that," Hemme said.“And the family is stuck in the same
place, ten years later, because they can’t communicate with each
other and can‘t complete the grieving process."

“[And] because they haven't even begun," Jarvis added.

Vmiir/Ji'ng Manon opened on Thursday and runs until sun-
day at Flanagan Theater. The show’s playwright Jeanmarie
Williams will be present after Friday's perrorrnance to answer
questions.

Dance-punk at pub

lfone or this week’s biggest events (it rhymes with hairy
and Haines) doesn’t satisfactorily bring enough sketch to
your life, checking outThe Chinese Stars and White People
Music in Lyle's next Wednesday night should probably do
the trick. It should also rid you or any memory or midsems
for a night, which can't hurt.

The Chinese Stars belong to that amorphous yet highly
saturated genre called “dance-punk" or “disco-punk." All
that really means is that the band likes to groove on discoe
like beats but has an aggressive and noisy style of playing
that relies heavily on the traditions of punk.

But Chinese Stars’ lyrics and energy set them apart from
most orthese bands.Their lead singer, Eric Paul, has a repue
ration for energetic live performances, cultivated from his
stint in Arab on Radar. a hardcore band from the late nines
ties.The lyrics vary From sleazy to somewhat innocuous and
never distract from Paul's persona or wailing voice.

This means that the concertgoer (or the innocent
Wednesday-night Lyle’s patron) should be ready to cut a rug
and break in the new pub with style on the night orits first
show with bands from outside of Grinnell, Be ready to shout
along, clap your hands, shimmy and get all that midsern-re-
latcd stress out.

Warm up with homemade hot and chocolatey treat

Winter’s still here! While I’m a huge fan of the snow and cold, I’m also willing to bet that you can’t wait to ditch the coats and mittens and relax for
a while in the»sun.To help cope, you might want to make a deliciousrhot cup of cocoa. We all (maybe?) know how to stir up a cup of Swiss Miss, but
here’s my favorite recipe for rich, chocolatey homemade hot chocolate.

What you need:

Milk (2%, whole, or skim with a dash of half & half is best)

Unsweetened baking cocoa

sugar
Flavorings, ifdesired

(anything from vanilla extract, to a mix of spices‘, to peppermint Schnapps)

Directions:

Mix together two parts cocoa to one part sugar (for a single 6-10 oz. cup of hot chocolate,
try a fourth cup cocoa plus 2 tablespoons sugar), and spices,‘ it’you‘re using them. Pour a glass
of milk into a mug and pop it in the micromve 'til hot (but not boiling!), or pour the milk in a

the touch (but, again, not boilingi). Mix in the cocoa mixture once the milk is hot and add any

ﬂavorings you'd like. Enjoy!

saucepan (if you happen to have one in your room or are borrowing one) and heat until hot to

. My favorite mix of spices: a little cinnamon, ginger and cayenne. Cinnamon, cloves and
nutmeg is also a great combination, or better yet, come up with your own!
