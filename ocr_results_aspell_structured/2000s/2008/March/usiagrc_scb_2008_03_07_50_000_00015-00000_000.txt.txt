Tennis’ 3 LaFOuntaine

Doubles partner, captain, mixer of ’erotic deception

In'JOHNNvBusE
As long as he can remember, Dan Laronn—
mine '09, has been smashing balls on the tenr
nIs court. After temporarily quitting tennis
at the age of six, LaFountaine returned from
retirement at the age ofnine. “Not many six»
yeareolds quit tennis," noted LaFountaIne.

A three-sport athlete throughout high
school. LaFountaine opted out of the Junior
Circuit, a move that most highly competitive
players make. It was not until LaFountaines
arrival at Grinnell that he
devoted himself fully to
tennis.

LaFountaine‘s twm
year record at Grinnell
is impressive, to say the
least, In his first year at
Grinnell, LaFounraine
racked up a dominating
25,2 record in singles play
He followed up his ﬁrst year with a strong
sophomore season,ﬂnishing singles play with
17 wins and five losses, as well as an appear
ance in nationals.

This year, LaFoiIntaine hopes to return
to nationals and improve on his playing level.
“Hopefully, ifl get back, I'll know what it's
like," said LaFountaine. ”I won’t be quite as
nervous when I get on the court,”

Singles play is only half of LaFounmine's
tennis life, though. over the years, LaFoun-
taine has smashed opponents and grown close
with his doubles partner, Nathan Fox '09.

“We met each other two days before new
student orientation started freshman year at
Kelsey’s restaurant,” said LaFountaine. “We
were roommates and doubles partners from
the beginning."

Larountaine and Fox have long posed a
threat to opponents. taking home conference

”He plays for the team and eve
eryorie on II. He won’t be happy
Wit pron/(e5 well, but Instead If
the whole team d085,”

Juan Perez Borja ’11

ﬁrst and second place t‘InIshcs fIIstand second
years, respectively, The two have high hopes
for rlus year, looking to advance to nationals
as a doubles [cam for the first time in only
their third year of competition together. So
tar this season, Fox and LaFountaine are un»
defeated in doubles play, having won all five
oftheir matches.

Beyond the rackets and balls of
tennis, LaFountaine and his teammates
have created a group morale that borders on
brotherhood. “We have
some youthful vigor, may
be some ignorance of how
Grinnell and athletics re-
late. Just go out there and
be 17 and 18ryearrolds
and have some silly hm,"
said LaFountaine. “This
year we have more stupid
silly rim with the young
guys as they learn their way,"

Lalrountaine's role as a captain, In both
creating and maintaining a vibrant team at—
titude, is Invaluable. A strong team player,
LaFountaine holds the team's well-being
high above his own. “He plays for rhe team
and everyone on it,”said]uan Perez Borja’ll.
“He won‘t be happy if he practices well, but
instead if the whole team does.”

Indeed, LaFountaine is a team player.
Following with the traditional role of tenr
nis captain, LaFDuntaine will assisst with the
creation of the dangerously mysterious mixed
drink'Erotic Deception’, He remained silent
on the drink IIselr, saying only that “the recipe
will remain secret,” as the tennis team-man—
dates, And ifthete’s one thing LaFountaine’t
teammates can count on him for, it's that he’ll
do whatever it rakes to make everything a lir-
tle bit better for everyone.

Pioneers fall short

syJaI GARG

It was Fild'ly night, and the mens basket-
ball team was ready to make it to the finals
of the lVlVl/C tournament However, like last
year, the Pioneers fell short, unable to defeat
the wellrbalanced attack of Carroll College,

The No, 3 seed, Carroll College,ivas able to
come away with a 124-122 victory to advance
to the finals for the WC championship.The
game resembled most of the Pioneers games
this season: llard-fuught and close till the very
end, Neither team was able to create an Insurr
mountable lead, and going into half time, No.
2 seed Grinnell only trailed by ﬁve points.

The second half brought With it more In’
tense play from both teams. The teams went
back and forth until 7:59, when a 3-pointer
from Bobby Long ’09 sparked Grinnell on an
11,4 run. However, the 105499 lead would not
last long; Carroll College stormed back and
with 3: 3 to take ti 111—1101ead.

Wit 32 seconds left, David Arseneault ’09
scored a crucial three followed by a key layup
from Keith Chamberlain '08 to tie the game
at 122 with only 16 seconds left, Knowing the
season was on the line, Carroll College drove
to the hole but failed to capitalize initially.
Then, one second and an offensive rebound

later, the season was all over {or the Pioneers
ofCtInnell College John Grotberg ’09 led all
scorers with 35 points, and Arsenaulr finished
the game with a double~double of 17 points
and 12 assists.

While the season began strong, it had tur-
bulenee along the way, including Injuries to
both Chamberlain and Arseneault. Predicted
to ﬁnish ﬁrst, Grinnell still played hard with
some strong play from their first years.

with this season over, players, coaches and
fans are looking forward to next season. The
conference is getting much deeper," said Scott
Kaitz '11. “Next year is going to be very tough
[with] Ripon, Lake Forest [and] Lawrence;
there will be six or seven teams competing to
be the four teams in the playoffs.”

The Pioneers will be bringing back the nae
rion's top scorer in Grotberg and top passer in
Al'smeaulLThey will, however, be losing four
pivotal seniors, “All ofthe seniors played a big
part," said Kane, “on and off the court they
were leaders."

The expectations are high for next season,
but until the men hit the court in November, it
is anyone’s guess where they will be this time
next year.
