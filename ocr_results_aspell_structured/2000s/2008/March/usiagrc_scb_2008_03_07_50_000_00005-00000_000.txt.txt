Outlaws and outsiders, fro

Into the Wild
(2007)

Young man starts new life in
well—made Sean Penn epic

Sean Pen. s best known for the intense, unsym-
pathetic and no-nonseuse charactcrs he plays in mov-
ies. l-lere, however, he swapped the actor's mask for
the pen and came through with flying colors.

Inn: 1/): Wild (based on a 1996 novel of the same
name), for which he wrote the screenplay and directs
cd, is far from the runeoferheemill, cheesy, bigebudgct
stuff Hollywood seems to churn out far more often
than is palatable to the audience.

The movie depicts the adventures of Christopher
McCandlcss (expertly played by Emile Hirsch), a top
student at Emory University and an athlete who dct
cides to give it all up and hitchhikc to Alaska to live
in the wild. He encounters several unique people who
change his life before he faces the dangers ofwildee
ness.

The story begins with an unhappy family, proceeds
through a series of encounters with the lonely and the
lost, and ends in a senseless, premature death.

But though the film’s structure may be tragic, its
spirit is anything but. it is infused with an expansive,
almost giddy sense of possibility, and it communicates
a pure, unaffected delight in open spices. fresh air and
bright sunshine.

But if the story is so morose, why watch it? Well,
there is the movie’s expert and fresh handling ofthe
mature subject of selfediscovcry and the message it
conveys.

The excellent and restrained performances, not
only by Emile Hirsch but the entire ensemble support
cast, including the ever-reliable Vince Vaughn (play-
ing a rowdy grain dealer), Kristen Stewart (a teenager
with a crush on McCandless), Marcia Gay Harden
and William Hurt (McCandless’ parents), are well
worth your time.

And finally, watch it for the beautiful cinematog-
raphy and magnificent crimetawork, evpertly captur-
ing the static and raw beauty ofAlaska.

There are really no downsides to this movie, uni
less you are so used to How to Loreﬂ any in 10 Digit
and its cousins that you can't handle serious cinema.
1er0 ll: Wildis a movre about the desire for freedom
rl-iat feels itselflikc the fulﬁllment ofthat desire.

American
-— Gangster (2007)

Strong performances breathe
life into 705 drug drama

You don't have any reason to not want to see
Anagram Gorgon. A Ridley Scott-directed gangster
epic starring Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe,
Josh Brolin (No Country ﬁt on Man) and even the
RZA (of the \h’utTang Clan) has more than enough
star power to sustain even the wciiecst script.

Thankfully, the strength of the script isn't an issue.
Based on the life of Frank Lucas (Washington), the
heroin kingpin of Manhattan, Allii‘l‘ii’ml Carrel/ci—
though it doesn't fully stack up to the heavyweights
of the gingster genre like Tire Goya/lo or Godw-
[migcncriilly holds its own.

Washington is as alternately menacing and charm»
ing as ever, and Crow: brings his usual weary and tore
titted character to life as passionately as usual.

Sometimes they are forced to deliver the oddly
outtoftcharacter remark as a deep thought, but gent
orally the dialogue is sharp and seemingly part ofthe
period rind the streets that the characters work.

Amer-{ran Gangs/er tenders those streets with
great period detail and precision, and their sweat and
hear and blood create some of the best moments of
the movie, such as in the climatic takeover of Frank

Lucas‘s drug-running operation in a tenement apart-
ment.

There is a great hazy and relaxed 7051511! sheen
over the entire film, wirl-i the period soundtrack coni-
plcmenling it in almost all cases.

The film could use some editing at times, as its
twotandtathalt'thour running time seems about 15
minutes too long, though that time doesn't come in
the extremely entertaining last half-hour, when Lu—
cas’s drug empire crumbles around him

The film’s efforts at paralleling the lives of Lil»
cas and Detective Roberts (Crowe) drain some of
the time and are awkward at other parts but probably
make httle difference to the enjoyment otthe mm.

Overall, little gets in the way ofa movie that has
all oflhe pieces to be extraordinary and usually is.

Assassination of
-— lesse /anies (2 007)

Top—notch talent can’t save
plodding historical drama

1n the mid-nineteenth century, Jesse James was
famous as a nee—Confederate bandit ﬁghting for the
glory the South lost in CivilVl/ar,

Tl/cﬂrmxlirmliml weer/amt by m Coward Rree
m Ferd attempts to reconstruct the last few months
of Jesse's Life leading up to his death, but the movie

H1TP1//\VWWiALLMOVlEPHOTOSsCOM

suffers from its ambition to he so meticulously ac—
cumte and realistic.

This problem is often a symptom of historically
based movies: just the title of the movie alone lets
you know exactly where the story will end up,Y:t the
movie takes nearly three hours to finally reach the
forelsnown conclusion, using the time to attempt to
thoroughly ﬂesh out Jumcs's character.

Unfortunately. we ire never adequately shown why
the outlaw is to be feared or respected, and despite
Brad Pitt's strong performance as James, it is difficult
to feel any strong emotions about his inglorious fate.

The movie is not without appeal. Pitt falls eas-
ily into Jaines’s persona as i psychopathic and deadly
madman, a role Pitt is used to playing (think Fig/n
crab). Cascy Aftleck, too, delivers a powerful per-
forinancc is the nervous, ambitious and tormented
Ford.

The cinematography is excellent, beautiiiilly cap»
rnring the lonely and desperate lives of the outlaws.
whether showing a lone figure titling to a solitary
cabin in a landscape swept with snow or the dusty
light streaming around James is he stands alone at
the window.

But nonetheless, 7711‘ Audition/ion o/yctre film's
fails to be a significant portrayal ofrhe last months of
America's most famous outlaw.

The fact that the failure |S laced with so much am-
hitiort, beauty and excellent acting makes it that much
more pronounced.

In attempting to analyze the legend ochsstames,
the movie strips the man orany glory, fictional or not,
his icon may have possessed.
