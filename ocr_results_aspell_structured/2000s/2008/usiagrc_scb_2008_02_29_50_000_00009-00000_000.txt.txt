Walking into state Streets Bowladroine on a Sunday after-
noon, your cars will pick up unsurprising sounds: the emslnng
of each ball against pins, casual banter between friends, and
the ot isional high-ﬁve and bellow ot' jubilation accompany
ing a strike. You. senses will not register much ota diffeicncc
between what goes on Sunday dftclnonns and any other howls
ing outing, but for a few Gi'innell students and locals, these
afternoons are quite special.

From 1- 30 to 3. 00 p m. each Sunday, the Grinnell Chapter
of Uniﬁed spot-ts meets at the bowling alley. Unified Sports
is a Special Olympics initiative, which, according to organizer
Brian Boyce '08, is a “progressive model of including people
with disnbilitics in activities that students doi" Here, a hand
ful ofGrinncll students inrermingle vvi and bowl alongside
a group of about 20 people with disabi ies from the Monte
ezuma and Grinneu communities. The program is “a cool set—
ting," which “doesn't assume tin inequality of abilities" between
the students and the community members, said Boyce, adding
that most participants howl better than he does.

Uniﬁed Sports works to create an atmosphere of equality.
They attempt to move beyond a mindset ofstudents serving the
other members oi‘the group, and instead work to build friend—
ship among all participants, The general feelings of equality
and camaraderie encouraged by the program boost confidence
in its partitipants, as well as fostering friendships between stu—
dents and community members. These sentiments show up in
the many smiling faces, joyful laughter and conversations that
fill the bowling alley “The college students treat us real well
[and ate] friends to us,"snid Lewis Fallingham ofMontczuma
while awaiting his next crack at the pins,

According to Deanna Shorb, currently serving her ﬁrst year
as Director ofCommunity Service, Uniﬁed Sports is the only
organization on campus to “deal explicitly with the cognitively
disabled."

For Boyce, the lack of other groups is part of his concern
that persons with developmental disabilities do not have a
recognized presence in the Gnnnell community or society in
general. “Lots of times people with cognitive disabilities often
aren‘t ﬁgured into the model ofhow we decide our social' inter-
actions work." said Boyce. It comes down to a question of how

we structure our sociery,"hc said.

While developmentally disabled persons may rarely surface
in the minds orcrinnell students they are an active part oftl-ic
college community on campus, regular bowler Bruce Kriegel
works in the equipment room ofthe PEG, and Kate Bennet re-
stocks napkins in the dining hall. “They are a part of the com-
munity,"snid Boyce ofKtlegel, Bennet, and all ottheii peers.

While both Shoib and Boyce said that there is not enough
dialogue on campus regarding the disabled, both see at lenst
some improvement and are optimistic for more positive chang-
es in the futuie.

The Grinnell Uniﬁed Sports program will soon ﬁnd itself
in a transition period, as organizers Allison Wiseo ‘08, Shannon
Walker '08. and Boyce all graduate at the end of this semester.
At the moment, the three are attempting to shepherd in young-
er students such as Kevin Parker’ll and Ann Luetzow’ll.

Many program participants expressed their disappointment
that the three would soon leave. However, veterans such as Neil
Waymck of Montezuma, who said he has been bowling in the
program since 1985, handle the inevitable transitions, He said
that he just ”feels comfortable with the people.“
