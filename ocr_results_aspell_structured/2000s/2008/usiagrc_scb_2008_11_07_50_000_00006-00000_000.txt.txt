It seems for you that the
historical and the personal
are inseparable in your novels.

Whyis this?

We are a history. Not only,
of course, our personal history
but the history of the moment
we grew up in and the history
ofthe momentonr parents grew
up. I come from a family who
was involved in revolution in Mexico, They
lost. One was executed, Another one run off,
sought exile, sought sancmary in Barcelona.
And,1 grew up with those tales at the dinner
tabloAnd they were more exciting to rue than
any movie or novel because they were running
for their lives.

My mom’s clad taught at West Point and
France, but he was still executed at the age
or 37 [while] running for the presidency of
Mexico, 50,1 know the ups and downsI know
what it means to lose big dreams. History leaps
into my writing. it goes counter to whatever
existential claims 1 might have about “we’re
alone in the world":iiid all that.

What does it mean to you to be a “Chin

cane Novelist?"
Chicanos used to be on the fringe. It's

like when African-Americans started to be
called black and then they went on to be called
African-Americans. It‘s hltving a cultural con,
sciousness. Chicanos live within the United
States but at the same time are aware that
they don’t share the same history as [someone
who has] an Angloesoon or Germanic back-
ground.

Basically, it's south ofthc boi-
der, but you don't belong to south
of the bordei anymore so we be

What will your next novel be

about?

It's about three women during
the 19305 in the Depression. At that time, there
was a group, a white slavery group, that wanted
white virgins, It was during the Depression
and there were lots oryoung girls walking the
streets. And,1 met the daughter ofonc orthose
young girls who was sold into slavery. And
this rich man wanted 12 or 13ryeai‘rold white
virgins. They paid a pretty price {or them, So
there would be houses where they would be
fed and dressed, And, then eventually at the
proper nme, he would deliver them to a hotel,
leave them there, and pick them up.

People don't know that there were about a
million Mexicans displaced during the Mexi—
can Revolution. During l—lerbeir Hoover's
time, he said that he wanted the Mexicans
gone from the United States. Here are these
people not wanted in their own country and
in the new country. So, once the Depression

cans by boat, truck, freight train, anything. so
there’s that element in it.

It's also about the fact that Mexicans built
Los Angelcs.They dug the ditches and drained
the swamps. And it’s not written about. So I’m
writing about LA, in the ‘30s from three difr

i'd been having a terrible writing block.
I had just finished writing a chapter that I
thought was a turning point. And my brother,
who is a writer, read it and goes,“1 don't know,
it kind ofleft me cold."l guess the bottom line
is that I've got into a funk and I haven} been
able to get truer ﬁnished the chapter, though.
My sister also had the same reaction as my
brother. Sometimes they don't see what you
want them to see.
