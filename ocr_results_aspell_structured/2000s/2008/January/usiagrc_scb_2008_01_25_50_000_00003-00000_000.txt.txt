Town pub shuttered for renovation

Local establishment to reopen in four months as Grinnell Ale-house, featuring restaurant, comedy and music shows

a four-month remodeling, was a (:ii-iirnell standby and the
“place to be" for the passably 21 on Wednesday nights,

The shuttering has saddened sortie seiiio #nnd the pubs
alumnus owner, James “Jimbo” S ' . i 'Ssihut all
agree the tinre had come. “I was really sad to close the place,"
explained Sadler-Tanzosch, “but the market in Grinnell has
changed.”

Twenty years ago, when the drinking age ivas 19, students
could fiequent the pub for all four years of college and made
up an estimated 80 percent ofbusiness. Now, only 25 percent
ofthe bar’s customers are students, most ofwhoin go only on
Wednesday nights.

The decline in student customers and the lack of solid ie-
lationships with regulars also had darker results—an increase
in studeirt and town customer tensions. Students were as—
saulted by drunken town members several times outside the
pub during the fall semester. “with an increasingly mixed
crowd, we'd have police visits every week and fights," said
SadlerrTarizosch, “It got to be really hard." He also said that
the time to find a new market was light: “I doubt we'd be able
to compete with the new pub on campus ”

Real estate developer Dick Knapp ’76 saw great opportu—
nity in the pub when he retrrined for a college reunion years
ago. Knapp had refurbished the historic Cunningham drug
store downtown and hopes for a similar success at the pirb.

During the next four months, the entire iriteliol of the
pub, including its notoriously farrlty plumbing, its lighting
and its decor will be remodeled, transforming it into the two—
story Grinnell Alehonse, on the top floor will be a 95~Sent
restaurant with a fireplace, below, the new pub will be found
in the old basement. SadlettTanzosch envisions the new puh
as a music venue, too, where bands and maybe comedy acts
can find a stage. The new pub will also be nonsmoking.

SadlertTarizosch wanted to keep the pub open until after
the annual senior party 100 Days, but the initial design phase
went quicker than cypected and work was able to begin early

While some students never set foot in the basement bar,
it was an important part of Grinnell for others, such as Nate
Lindsay'09. “I was introduced my freshman year to the Down
Under Pub and I imagined it to be an institution that would

house will be a great platc for students, but I think those of
us who got to experience the Down Under Pub were blessed
with a bar that truly exempliﬁed our college culture,"

Some students have welcomed the move and the prospect
for a refurbished venue.

“I'm glad it closed and is going to remodel because I didn't
get good vibes in there. it was like a dank cave in there," said
Katy Harris '03. “I like bars, 1 just don't like the pub." Af-
ter the remodel, Harris thinks some students will frequent it
despite the new campus pub. “You don’t have the feeling of
being at the bar because it’s on campus."

Harris instead said that she might shift her patronage to
the new campus pub, “Myself, I‘d probably want to check out
the new pub, And like nice inside, I’ll stay,” she said.

Liza Newman ’08,‘on the other hand, a regular at the pub
on Wednesday nights until its closure, was disappointed by
the closing. “I do not feel that it was time to go seeing as the
student pilb has yet to open as a replacement," she said. “Pub
nights were a means to see other seniors who i would not have
otherwise. and I think a lot of us will miss the spontaneous
bond formed singing along to the jukebox with some tutor
rialrinate or former floorrmate you can’t remember why you
weren’t friends with in the first place.”

An uncommon midyear change in RLC
staffing has caused swift action in the Stur
dent Affairs office and left over halfofNorth
Campus with unfamiliar staff,

Brad and Tiffany Menard, RLCs for
sinounker and CND, respectively, left
Grinncll over winter break to take positions
at George Mason University in Fairfax, Viir
ginia. Over the break. Katie
Lau was hired as the new
CND RLC, but a replaces
rncnt in Smounkcr is still
pending,

The sudden departure
of the lvicnards surprised
students and staff members
alike. Clangtala RLC Megan
Perry said that student Aft
rfnirs knew that the Menards
had applied for a job elsewhere, but “they had
told us initially that they had decided not to
take the jobs, so it was surprising."

Kiln Hinds-Brush, Loosehcad RLC, said
that the lVlennrds later accepted liftchiffany
was also offered ajob, which made thi: offer
difficult to pass up, “It's closer to home, and
it's a great opportunity," HindsrBrush said.
noting that both Brad and Tiffany were from
upstate New York,

Emily Jacobson '09, the student Acivisor
on the second ﬂoor of Smith, said that the
sudden departure was disappointing for her
and other students. “It's unfortunate that it
happened to coincide with semester break for
us and not the end ofthe year .. . many people
chose to live in Sniounltei' because of Brad.
He’s a really good RLC, He's full to work
with,"slie said.

Hinds-Brush agreed that students were
not happy about the events. think they’re

having the same reaction I had,"Hinds-Brusll
said. “They're upset, they're angry, Brad and
Tiffany were my friends. There were a few
people that picked to be on Younkel' staff be
cause they wanted to work with Brad."

Strident Affairs wasted no time in search-
ing for replacements. Advertisements were
posted the same afternoon, and phone inter-
views were held a week later. Liiu, who had
been looking for a position
since May, said that she was
hired by Jan 4. “It's been less
than a month from applying
until I moved here," she said.
“i‘in excited to get back into
higher education."

As the college continues
to search for tr replacement
for Smounkei, HlndS’BluSl‘i
will be in charge of Younkei
and Perry will take on Smith and five lair
guitge houses. This increases HiirdsrBiiisli’s
workload by over 100 students and Perry,
who now oversees ten buildings, by around
90 students. “Male students are going to get
locked out. there are more study breaks to “(T
tcntl, more S/\s for them to keep an eye on,”
Jacobson s. d

HllidSTBulsh, however, is not worried,
“i'm just going to have to be more organized
I'll be working more on weekends," she
said,

Perry agreed. “It'll take up some more
tirne,"Pcrry said, “but all of us (100(le that it
would be better to have had two people who
knew what they were doing than bringing
someone on we didn't think would be a good
fit here."
