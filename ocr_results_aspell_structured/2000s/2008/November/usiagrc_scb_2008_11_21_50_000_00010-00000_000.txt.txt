Living in limbo: Wal- Mart at 4 a. m.

BYM aNno MONTAND

Wal Mart Is one of the only business in
Grinnell that remains open 24 hours a day, the
ﬂuorescent light radiating across its vast park-
ing lot at once a terrifying and beautiful sym»
bol otcivilieatiouWhile it may be comtorting
(lml were you, say, in desperate need orcotron
balls or hunting gear at 4 am. you would have
somewhere to turn, onc has to wonder how
many people actually take advantage of such
opportunities. What exactly goes on in Wale
Mart at 4 am?

To answer this question I, along tvith sew
eml other Grinnellians, set out to investigate
the laternight/early morning culture of Grinr
nell’s Wﬂl’NlmL

At3:55 am. this past chucsday morning,
SistB editors Jai Garg'11 and Johnny Buse’ll,
5&B photographer Lawrence Sumulong '09,
Joey Wendel '11 and myself crammed into a
silver Oldsmobile in the parking lot outside of
HalHCS.WC pulled into the desolate Wal-IVIart
parking lot at approximately 4 rim. to find 12
other cars and one semi-truck.

When we walked inside the store we were
greeted by the familiar blare ofindusttial ﬂuor
rescent lights, while the muted TVs hanging
from the ceiling played a WalrMatt channel
on a loop. A small group of sales associates
wete congregated around rhe customer service
desk, engaging in conversation,

We walked over to the electronics section
where we saw a sales associate stocking DVDs.
She was short and looked to be in her mid-30s,
with :1 bob hair cut, large framed glasses, and a
namerag reading “Norma,"

I learned that Norma used to work at the
Wal—Mart in Fella—only 30 minutes away—-
but she moved with her husband to accept a
job working the grave-yard shift in Grinnell.
“We wanted to get out ofPella,” Norma said,
barely making eye contact with me, “so we left
when we got the opportunity."

I was about to ask what made her move 30
minutes from Fella to work virtually the same
job at the same place, when the store manager
came up and informed us that there was “No
photography inside the store, its a corporate

policy." He was young, and looked like
he was in his early 20s His black goatee and
glasses made him look like a nerdy Lucifer.

“That goes the same with interviews," he
informed us.

Both the store manager and Norma had
large black bags under their eyes, which was
not surprising7WalrMart night shifts don't
usually end until
7 a.m., so they
werejust nearing
the end of their
shift.

“l'm going to
have to see you
delete rhe pic-
tures," he said,
slowly walking
towards Law—
rence.

While the
store manager
pestered Law
rence over the
pictures, I started
walking around the
store looking for more people 1 could inter-
view that tvcren'r employees.

As I was approaching the fresh bread sec-
tion, I saw rwo men wearing dark hoodies and
covered in tattoos and piercings.

I carefully approached them, trying to ap*
pear cheerful but not too enrhusiastic. They
scowled at me and started in the opposite dl’
rection. “We're on our lunch break, we don‘t
have two minutes,"one ofthem said, avoiding
eye contact.

As I scanned the store for potential intern
vicwees, I became mesmerized by the repetir
tivc movements of the sales associates as they
stocked the shelves like mﬂChlliBSsI soon found
a couple in the discount isle ncar che Christi
mas decorations,

They looked like they were in their late 405;
the woman was short with a blue jacket that
said “Barbra"across the front,and the man was
tall with right blue jeans, a brown parka and u
camouﬂage baseball cap. inside their cait was

 

A want/raw emplayerpaorer re/ii/c rocking circa-mun,

chocolate milk orange soda Crisco and butter,
and eggs

Ir turns out that Barbra and Delwin
Ebert always do their shopping after they got
ctr working the late night shift at Vanwyk’s
Trucking oi-i Southeast Street,just three minr
utes away. They have worked there for 15 years,
Barbra as a data processor and Delwin as a

supervisor who also
occasionally drives
trucks. “The shifts
aren‘t too bad,” Del—
win said. “You get
used to it quickly,”
“Don’t forget
that's where we
met,"Barbrii chimed
in, smiling at her
husband. "We like
shopping at night
because its quiet,"
she continued “We
don't like the rush
during thc day. "

Before I could ask
them anything else,
they excused themselves and continued shopr
ping. i found the rest of my group in the fror
zen food section, fascinated that the lights in
the freezers are motion censored.

It was 4:45 am. when we left WalrMart.
an unsettled feeling in each of our stomachs
which was partially because of the food we
purchased after our interviews failed and par-
tially because we were all disappointed that we
hadn’t discovered some profound truth or un-
covered a rlin ng larcenight Wat-Mart suh-
culture.

“The day is in limbo,"Johnny said dazedly
in the car. “Half an hour from now, you’d be
waking up really early, and half an hour ago
you'd be up really late."

That’s what Walthlill't is at 4 r\.m.7limbo.
Within the haunting quIct of the WalrMatt
superstore the workers and the people drift
between day and night, sleeping and waking,
andias in Norma’s oitseibctwccn srages in
their lives.

Grinnellians will'now think twice before settling' into a Burlr
ing heanbag or when they heat gentle rustling coming from
their roommate’s bed. At last weekend’s Fetish Harris parry,
Gregersen and l-Iowort announced the results of the campuy
wide sex survey they conducted as part ofthe Gumball Chain
lenge, in which they raised a total of 123 dollars. Turns out
Grinnellians actually do put their money where their mouths
are. In fact, it seems there are quite a few other things they put
there as well.

An estimated 350 students filled out the survey, but despite
this relatively large sample size, cregersen had some doubts
about the validity ofthe rcsults. “I think we got u very specific
sector that was willing to fill out the survey,” Gtegetsen said.
“So rm not sure it these results were representative of every
one.

Whether or not the survey represents the student body as
a whole, the whole student body wIll likely have something to
say about them, “i thought the most disgusting one was the
academic building question.” said Laura Garcia '1 1. “it's kind or
sickto think that you could be sitting in a dcskwhere someone

just had sex. People go to Mac Field—there’s no need for the
science library or something."

Since rumors about the dark and dirty corners of Burling
fourth have been ﬂoating around for years, the fact that a third
ofGrinnell students rcporrcd having otgasmed in an academic
building does not come as much ota surprise. For some star
dents though, Grinnell's orgy action left much to be desired.
“The percent of Grinnellians who have had orgies was only
12 percent,"I—lowort said.“I feel like that could have been a lot
higher."

1: Grinnell gets lucky next year, and a similar survey is con-
ducted, Gregersen suggested changes to make it more relevant
to all students. “I would include more questions for people who
were not sexually experienced," Grcgersen said. “There were a
lot of people who came up and said ‘1 don't think this applies
to me.”

While the sexual nature ofthe survey may have been a turn
off for many students, the mosr popular fetish revealed the dis
tiiictly liberal arts nature of the student body, “I didn’t think
that NPR was going to be that popular," Howott said. “I guess
Grinnellians are actually that nerdy."
