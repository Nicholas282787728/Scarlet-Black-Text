This past wockond, rho Wild Turkeys wa-
tet polo team complorod thel ason by rm-
ishing sixth in the Men's D' sion Ill Club
Championship in Philadelphia, PA. The
team went 1—2 at narionals, including a loss
to eventual champion Lindenwood Univer-
srty, Despite the record, the
team was happy with their
overall performance. “We
lost our first game and eom~
plctely destroyed the second
team,"said Alex Phillips '12.
“We played a really good
last game that I feel really
good about.”

Earlier in the season,
the team failed to capture
the Heartland Divisrori, lusrng to Monmouth
College for the division championship We
just dropped the ball [against Monmouth],"
Phillips said, “There WilS a lot of individual
acting rather than acting as a team, that was
sort ofour downfall, hutD that sct iis offon thc
wrong foot at nationals"

Hoarrland Confcrcncc, the team was placed
cight and was cnsurcd to meet perennial
foo Lindonwood University, which defeated
Grinnoll in last year's championslnp nrarch.

“Lindenwood is a Dl-quality room, they
play D1 roams all year and than come play in
the D3 tourriament,"sriid Co-Coacll and Co-
Caprain Mart Hochstein
’09. “Their players don't
like it, their coaches don't
like it, their school likes the
fact they can bring home a
trophy every year." Though
Grinnell put up a valiant efr
fort, their loss was not much
ofa surprise.

In the first half, the team
kept the game quite close.
In the second quarter, Grrnriell matched
Lindcnwood University goal for goal as they
scored four each “We had them scared," said
Hochstein “They were up 10 6 at the 1111 f."

However, the team could not sustain its
high lcvcl of play and Lindcnwood pulled
ahead for good in the third quarter with nine
unanswcrod goals, winning 23-7.

Following the loss to Lindcnwood Unk
vorsrty, rhc roam camo out ﬁring on all cyls
indcrs in tho socorrd round game against
carrrcgio Mollorr Univor-sity, By halrrirnc,
the offense had doused the goal with an on-
slaught of shots to take a commanding lead
of 9-i.The toam would go on to scoro seven
more unauswotcd goals in rho third poriod.
By the time tho frnal bcll had rung, rho Tur-
keys had drowned the Carnogio Mellon Tar-
rans 22-3. “It was hard because wo playod tho
ﬁrst game against a team that by all accounts
was out of out league," Hochsteiri said “The
second team wo played wasn't really national

quality."

The Fall Classic, more potent than sleeping pills

How could a World Series that featured
three oneerun games and a twoiun game be
so incredibly terrible? it probably had some
thing to do with BJ. Upton attempting to due
plicate the 2002 version of Barry Bonds with
every swing of the has, all the while forgets
ring that raking pitches every now and again
may actually provc useful. it also didn't holp
that tho Rays normally stellar dcfcnsc only
seemed to appear for a handful of plays at a
time, while the quality of rho urnpiring was as
poor as Evan Longoria’s strikoout raro.

Lot's also not forgot Gama three of tho
World series. it appears, on paper, to be a
fantastic game with a Phillros lcad cvaporar-
ing in rho lator innings only to bo rogainotl
with a \valk-offwinner.

One could only imagine the drama that
must have occurred, drama that might have
rivaled such memorable moments as Puckett
in’9l,Gibson in’88,or Fisk ln’85. When his
tory looks hack upon this game it may view it
fivorahly, but those that watched knew that it
was the most boring, least thrillingg rvame won

in the final airbat in World Series history.

A hitebyepitch, a wild pitch, a throwing
error, two intentional walks, and a swinging
hunt later, and Philadelphia pulled off the
most horingly “exciting" winner since pretty
much any close game of the 2005 NBA Fri
mils,

This series, unfortunately, wasn't out of
the ordinary. Thcrc hasn't been a halﬁvay
decent Fall Classic

Luckily for sports fans, they don't have to
just sit idly by until pitchers and catchers re,
port. Though the baseball season ended with

be similarly taintedtl am optimistic about the
remainder of the NFL season. and the start

Presidentselect Baiack
Obarna, I will attempt to ford some hope for
Cl'cil the lowliest dregs ofprofessroiial sports
society.

The Lions may be one right now, but help
is on the way. sure Daunte Culpepper is no
more than a quick fix at the quarterback poe
sition, but at least he might provide a lirtlo

 

 

stability, and with his track record of killing
the Vikings in crucial games, Detroit is sure
to knock off Minnesota in Week 14 to avoid
going winless on rho season.This will deliver
a cruslnng blow to a division rival’s playoff
chances while not affecting their firm grip on
the #1 ovorall pickt .

Even in the NBA where the Knicks have
been driven into the ground with more force
than a Jack Tatum li‘rt, there is still reason to
bc oprinrisric. Mike D‘Antoni may have a
roster that doesn’t ﬁt his style, but the cons
stanr LeBlon James in 2010 rumors and the
thought of a JamessD’Antoni combination
should he more than enough reason for any
basketball fan to pray that LeBron finally gets
out of the sports hellhole that is Cleveland

If that fills through, all I can hope is that
they finally learned their lcsson from the pres
viuus managerial regime. Howcvor, should
they continue in their losing ways, rhoy know
exactly who to blame: Isiah Thomas's daugh-
tor.
