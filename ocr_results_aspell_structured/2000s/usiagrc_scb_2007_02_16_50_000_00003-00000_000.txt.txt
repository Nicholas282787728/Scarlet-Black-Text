China rises despite logistics

BY ARI ANISFELD

on a recent episodc of the popular television show “The
Colbert Report,"host Stephen Colbert began by congratulating
China fol “already [being] n military and economic superpoiw
er." Colbert’s observation was not lost this week at the college's
most recent Rosenfteld Symposium, “The Rise of China."

The symposium featured presentations on a range of relr
cvant topics including the country's military development, dos
mestic legal reforms, and rural unrest. The symposium, which
consisted of nine evcnts, featured prominent speakers from
both the academic and political realms such as Chinese Diplor
mat Iia Xiudong and Kenneth Lieberthal, Seniol Director for
Asia on President Clinton's National Security Council.

What was your experience of service in for- C H I
eign alTaits before coming to the United States '
as a diplomat? How did you perceive America
at that time and is it diaerent from what you see
here?

When lwas in college,l was an English major;
so I learned something about the English speaks
ing countries. I chose American studies as my
concentration for graduate studies.We had lots of
lessons on Various aspects of the United States, like
its politics, economy and culture. At that time we
mainly learned from books.Then I worked in the
Foreign Ministry and was directly involved in deal-
ing with America. I saw America as a big country
with a strong economic and military power, It is
also a country with a unique culture, as the Amerir
can pop culture has vast inﬂuence and popularity

in the world. Yet America is highly diversiﬁed and
does not have a homogeneous culture, So I realized that to deal
with Americans one must also look from various perspectives.

What, in America’s social and political life, impressed
you the most in your work?

1 found that in everyday life, Americans are very easy to
communicate and therefore we maintain good relationship
with our American colleagues and partners. US. politics are
also highly diversified. However, sometimes some countries
might feel that the US is not paying enough attention to the
other countries' feelings. Ofcoutse,we also see Americans who
have realized this problem and advocated diplomacy based on
equality, In addition, we hope that the US. abides to its prom-
ises,like the ones it made on the Taiwan issue to China, instead
ofacting solely on national interests [of the time].

What do you perceive as the challenges as well as the
opportunities for SinorUS relationship brought by use new
Democratic Congressional leadership?

As diplomats we have a fundamental rule, which is not to
intervene in the domestic affairs of the countries we station in.
Therefor,e it is not appropriate for me to comment on this.Yet
[I believe] both of the two countries’ legislative bodies should
playa constructive role [in the China-US relationship]. Hence,
no matter which party has the majority, we always hope that
the US congress acts constructively and does not pass bills that
are detrimental to our bilateral relationship, Members of Cont
gress have different opinions on China and different degrees of
knowledge about Chi na, We hope that through bilateral efforts
of communication we can enhance our mutual understanding,
Members ofCongress who really know China well tend to have
a more comprehensive and fairer opinion towards China, and
the policies they come up with are better for the bilateral rela-
tions. Lack of understanding will affectjudgment. We welcome
members ofcongress to visit China, and such visits really make
a difference.

Do you have any suggestions for the Grinnell students
studying abroad in China?

It is indeed a very good opportunity for the students to go
abroad, to broaden their view and have face to face commUr
nication with the other peoples. For the students coming to
China, I would suggest that they go to a variety ofplaces in the
country lfa student comes to Beijing or Shanghai, they should
not simply stay there. They should go to other places, like rur
ral area and the western part of China, so that they can hlwe
a more complete view ofthc country. Instead ofjust looking
at the newly built skyscrapers, it would also be good for them
to have more interactions with the ordinary people there and
learn more about the real Chinese culture and Chinese values
7 what the Chinese people think and care about, what they
dream and worry about. in order to enhance their understand-
ing to China.

OSENFIELD SYMPOSIUM
of the most

important issues in American foreign policy." he said, “[The
Rosenﬁeld Committee] thought it would be a good idea to
delve into this issue and what its implications are."

Chinese Diplomat Jia Xiudong opened the event on Mon
day with an overview ofrecent developments in China, FOHOWT
ing the presentation, Jia fielded questions from the audience
on China’s involvement in Darfur, weapons in space and the
country’s relationship with Taiwan.

Some ofJia‘s comments, such as those on free speech, met
with skepticism from the Grinnell audicnce.When asked about
government censorship on the Internet and elsewhere, one of
the country's most controversial moves, jia replied that while

“the Chinese government is not an enemy ofthe Internet," it
has to be “careful not to cause social instability."

Moyel‘ worried that “[Chinese leaders] are suppressing
freedom of speech and human rights to a greater extent than
they need to maintain their regime." other audience meme
bets, such as Tommy
jamison '10, felt the —

said. “And I mean that _ _ g

can muster.” . //

According to orgar [JO/’(y'
nizets, Mt. lia's prescnr
tation gave audience
members a mainland
perspective against
which to compare oth
er presentations. For Moyer, the inclusion of strong and varied
outlooks was intentional. “We were trying, over the course of
the week, to get a variety ofperspectives," he said.

Han Shin Lin ’08, a native of Taiwan who helped orga-
nize the events, considered the symposium an opportunity to
educate the campus and community about the history between
Taiwan and China and their rising tensions. Lin participated
as a member ofwednesday's student panel, providing rhe Tai.
wan perspective.

Jia explained that to Beijing “the most important single
issue is the Taiwan issue" He made it very clear that China
“would never tolerate Taiwan independence." on Wednesday
evening, Byron Weng, Professor of Public Policy at Chi Nan
University in Taiwan, talked about the implications of China‘s
rise for Taiwan.

Despite high hopes for the symposium, some of the events
were beset by unforeseen problems. Lleberthal, who was sched-
uled to speak on Americaanhinese foreign relations,was un—
able to attend due to an unexpected hospital stay.

The 4:30 presentation by Boston College scholar Joseph
Fewsmith was postponed until 9:30 because Fewsmith’s ﬂight
was canceled and he had to drive to Gtinnell from Saint Lou-
is.

For Meyer, the absence of Liebetthal \‘ms a significant set—
back as he “would've been able to address very specifically. . .co-
operation wirh the Chinese." Moyer and others still consid-
ered the event a success, given the number and range of other
events. “We stuffed as much as we could conceivably but in a
week,"he said.

Student staff recruitment reaches goal:

After low numbers last year, applications better than expected

BY MEGAN COERING

Becca Bernstein ‘10 be—
gan considering applying to
student staff after a born»
bnrdment of c-mails. Shc
approached Vanessa Taylor,
Jamaland RLC, and “talked
for about an hour" to learn
more about the experience.
After reading the emails
and posters, and havtng the
conversation with Taylor,
Bernstein finally decided to
apply to student staff.

After a disappointing
turnout at this time last year,
Residence Life Stuff con-
ducted an aggressive recruit»
merit campaign this winter
for next year's student Stuffs

Two new RLCs, Megan
Perry and Jennifer Bicnek,
spearheaded this year’s rcr
cruitment effort. Using er
mails and posters, as well as
contacting students directly,
they sought to get 66 tips
plications, due last Friday.
When the dust settled, Party
and Bienek had exceeded
their expectations, getting 70
applications total.

Each year, two RLCs lead
the effort to recruit, interview
and select between 40 and 60

new SAs and HSCs who serve
as resources for other students
on campus. As in years past,
Perry and Bieniek held two
information sessions, which
drew about 70 participants
overall.

This situation stands in
stark contrast to last year. RLC
Kim HindsrBrush worked to
select this
year's staff
last spring,
When too
few students
otiglnallyapr
plied for the
51 openings,
Student Afr
fairs decided
to extend the
deadline by
an additional
week. “So many people were
removed from staff [in the
20052006 school year] that a
lot ofpeople had a bad View of
staff," HindsrBrush said

The extended deadline
prompted “about a dozen"
more applications from the
gible students, many of which
wele "pclsolmlly dellveled
to certain people we thought
would be g00d,”l’lllldsrBrush

”So manypeop/f were removed
from Siaffﬁn the 2005-06

school year] that a lot afpeop/e
had a bad View of staff” it

said,

Despite the lastrminute
efforts, the selection commitr
tee had only 64 candidates
for 51 openings by the time it
began interviewing. In addir
tion to 51 8A5 and HSCs, the
committee sought to solidify
a number of alternates in case
students plans changed.

only had

nates.”

But last year’s recruit—
ment was further compli—
cated, because most SAs
would be working with new
and unknown RLCs. Long-
time RLCs Stephanie Masta,
LcAnnc Ioncs, and Laura
Connel‘s all left Grinnell afr
tcr multiryear tenures, lcaVr
mg serious uncertainty as to
how the college would find so

many new RLCs in a single
year and making many stu-
dents hesitant to work with a
new and unknown face,

Ryan Long '07 worked
on Clangrala student staff for
two years with Jones, but did
not apply last year, when she
was leaving. “I was not new
essarily willing to make the
changes needed to work with
a new RLC,” he said.

While various factors have
an impact on applications, the
role of student staff remains
attractive for the same classic
reasons.

According to Chloe Sikes
'10, many students are look»
ing to “get more involved with
other people at the college [on
a] loxvrkey scale." Sikes menr
tioned the community among
current student staff as well its
the opportunity to plan «cum,
munityrbuildmg" events for
hall residents.

Bernstein looks forward
to such activities. “I liked the
idea of knowing more about
theschooland helpingyoung-
cr people through problems
you've already experienced,"
she said. And getting a single
wouldn’t be halfrbad either.
