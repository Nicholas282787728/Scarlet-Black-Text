“We're eoncctned with eeonomie divetsity," ttustee Russell Allen
‘68 said. “Out pool orappliaanis has ineteasiiigly reﬂected people or
less altluent baeltgtounds,"

The tesolution allows the office of admissions to be double in
how it achieves the goal. it simply asles admissions to “tectuit mote
low-need and novneed students" and to “plate gttatet emphasis on
metit based financial aid." Hewevet, the tesolution also tenrritmed
the college's commitment to need-blind admissions. meaning the
olriee of admissions inust attiaet mote wealthy ptospective students

will be admitted and entollcd.

anothct inviiation to apply. The college does not extend a second
invitation to uniesponsive studenis who live in pooiei Zip codes

The second tactic is to send mote teptesentatives rioin the coin

siininet said the goal ortht admissions depnttment is to convey to
ptospective students that whutcvet they pay, whethei its 52,500 or

“[Wc've] lived with it for ﬁve year: and we just couldn't accummo-
date big dinnets," said Osgood.

The budget fot the addition comes out or the Building Mainte»
nante and equipment Fund which is used to tenovate and tetote
many buildings on campus. Anothet ptoieet coveted by the fund was
the tenovation or Catnegie this summet. Approwi fot the ptoiects

Osgood’s residence, at 1600 Park Sr.. was built in 1960. As a
tesult orsome design changes made at the last minute, the house was
ptovided with a vety small dining toom When the Ptesidents house
was tenovated in 1998 it was made much mote enetgy erneient and
electtical witing was eliminated completely in the old dining toom.
The dining toom, whieh amt’ding to Osgoodwas otiginally a porch,

The addition is patt ofiong-(erm tenovations planned rot the
college, ineluding moving catering out olctinnell House into the

The new dining team will cost atound $200. 000 and to eut

When asked about the tenovation in the light or the elimination
