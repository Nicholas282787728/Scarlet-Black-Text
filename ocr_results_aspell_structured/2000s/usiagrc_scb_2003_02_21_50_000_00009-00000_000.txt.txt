Pussy out on that tattoo? All is not lost. Down the hall are
less bloody options for asserting your independence. Atomic
also scores high for cleanliness and a professional staff, It's
a little more attractive to students, so you may meet some
hot University oilowa boys. Still, it has the same rebellious
independent shop atmosphere as SubCulture. SD go, you
rebel you.

Coral Ridge Mall

14 Coral Ridge Ave., Coral Ridge, lowa
Although not technically in lowa city, Coral Ridge is just
what you need when you get sick of all the damn socialism
on campus. The biggest mall in Eastern Iowa is a shrine to
shallow and empty consumerism. And nothing is as sweet
as the taste of commercialism. 5o change out of that old T-
shirt that you found on the shoulder of 1-80, for God’s sake,
put on some shoes and do your country proud by spending
some good American money.

Yen Ching Restaurant

Cantonese tood is interesting, exciting, exotic and non-
existent in towa. Ven thing is probably the sole place in
lowa tor real, authentic Cantonese. The restaurant has an
authentic feel and mood lighting. It is possibly the highest
quality Chinese food ingeastern iowa and lacks the fast:
tood reel at most Chinese restaurants in the area.
