by Erik Gable
Staff Writer

Is Grinnell’s commitment to meeting
students’ full demonstrated need falling by
rhe wayside?

Thar was the question addressed by rhe
srudenewiio gathered in rlae Forum Soudi
Lounge lasr Friday arrornoon to ralk rie
nances with three trustees who were on
campus for rhe weekend.

Many praised the college's needrblind
admissions policy and commirmenr ro
moering every srudenrs full demonsnared
need, but also worried rhar despise
Grinnell'x commitment to ﬁnancial aid in
rheory, some srudenrs mighr be falling
rhrough the erode.

SGAPrmident Paul Ford ’02 read aloud

a ierrer from Shannon Heifeman '04, a stu-
denr who said unexpected hnaneial prob.
lems could keep her rrom arrending Grin-
nell next year, and a lerrer published in the
M3 by Ariel Godwin '02 obieering ro tu-
irion hikes, “Those are just rwo expressions
of rhe frusrrarion we're srarring ro see on
campus," Ford

said.

Ford rhen
urged srudenis to

he said.

As a parenr, Morgan added, “I am
also very mindrul orrhesrresses rhar all
famlies are going rhrough ar rhis rime,”

Trusrees worry abour spending roo

gan said, because Li-lcy wanr ro have rhe

Morgan said he
wanred srudenrs ro

questions. First:

+ $2,940 (room)
+ $3,390 (board)

+ $272 (student activity fee)

+ $110 (health fee)
$56 (facilities fee)

$29,860

”ObVIously there are some

students for whom the num-

bers are not adding up.”
—Paul Ford ’02,

“Forgetting money. are you gemng rhe edur
earioii you mine forin die environmenr you
thoughr youd have?"

Second: “Whar efreer do you tliink it

complerely eshausred rhe endowmsnr, :Ls

position?"

Paying for a
sehool like Grin-

fieoforanyfamily,
Barr argued

“A n y r h i n g
Lhar’s worrh having. and is as imporranr ro
you as a good education is to your life, re.
quires sacriﬁce."

Despire rliar, Barr said he and other
rrusrees were oommirrad as making sure “no
person will ever be deprived ofa Grinnell
eduearion ror eeonomie reasons,”

No marrer how good orinnells ﬁnan»
cial aid sysrem mighr be. some srudenrs
feared the ”stickershock“ faerorwould sears

“Grinncll may be needblind. bur pro.
speerive srudenrs aren’t," said Jennie
Wheeler ‘02. four years ago, Wheeler
added, she wasn'r even allowed ro apply ro
schools wirh high prise rags.

Next year, rho comprehensive fee will
rail iusi $140 shorr ofrhe $30,000 mark—
a 5.5 pcrcenr increase from rhis year.

Though Grinncll'x commirmenr on pa.
per to meering every srudenr's ﬁnancial need
rliroughour dieir four years here is oiron
praised, Ford nored rhar tor many, rmiity
didn'r march rheory.

“Every rime i say rhai in acrowd ofstu»
done, i hear laughrer, i see shoulders shrug,"
he ssid. ”Obviously rhere are some srudene
for whom rhe numbers are nor adding up."

Randy Marrinson '04 said
the numbers don't add up tor
his morher, whose bills for

Grinnell College rhinks she ean pay for
somerliing‘ like rhar, when she can'r even
pay for her renr or have her elecrriciry
swirched on,” he said. -

Marrinson said part ofrhe money he
earns from work srudy goes home to pay
his morher’s eleerric bills.

Kirsren Plowman '04 said rhe work
schedule she needed ro sriels ro in order ro
make her work sriidy allormenr was derri.
menrai ro her Grinncll experience, “I work
very, very hard, and many rimes ar rhe sac.
rifice ofmy classes, my education," she said,

One rheme sounded ar the forum was
an especially familiar one: srudenrs’ suspi-
cion rhar college deeisionmakers wanr
Grinncll ro beeome more like renowned
peer insrirurions like Swarriimore College,

“When I looked at Grinnell, I consid.
ered ir over some higher—cosr institutions
beeause l was looking for an insrirurion rhar
was prestigious bur nor prerenrious." said
sainanrlia Garrerr '04.

“tees srop rrying ro he somerhingwe're

The image orpowers.diar.be who ivsnr

“We wanr rhis ro be the rernfie place
rhar ir is, and nor like someplace else," Barr
said.

if the forums purpose was ro bring

“We heard a lot ofsrories rhar indicared

larer. “What we heard suggesrs rhar rhere
are rhings rhar need to be followed up on,
and so were following up on rhem,"

Barr agreed, “This didn’t just go up in
