About Mi Ranchita

Launch: Downtown Oskaloosa, about 30 miles from here.
Take Route 146 south, turn left at the Searsboro T-
junttion, and Osky’s a straight shot from there, Go
straight into town, and the restaurant will be plainly
visible on your left when you reach the park.

TVPE: Mexican, In Texas they call it TengeX, but every-
where else it’s just Mex.

Proﬁt unﬁt: 58-312 with drinks, etc.

WAIT TIMI: Vou'll probably have to wait for a table if you
come on a weekend night. Then there’s the instant gratic
ﬁcation of chips and salsa, followed by food in 15 min
Utes or so.

WANIH‘IZ one finger puppet thief. The suspect is wanted
in connection with the theft of several small, cute ﬁnger
puppets from the ofﬁces of the Scarlet 8i Block earlier
this week. The ﬁnger puppets are greatly valued by the
staff of the SEE, as puppet shows are the only means
the stafr has to express their pent-up aggression and
hatred. The suspectis considered neitherarnled nor dan-
gerous, as he is probably wearing the stolen ﬁnger pupa

’really mean' and inexpli cabllr drawn to stealing
