sults from the ion 26 low State Open
in Amesirh: men's and the women's
teams eaeh exhibited the kind of talent
and depth they will need to make some
noise in eonferenee.

For the men, cross country holdoveis
Adam Booth '04 and Ben Dyer '04 went
onenvo in (he SOOamcrer run to continue
Grinnell [kaS dominanm in long distance
events and lead the team to a sixth place

finish. Booth finished first with a time of
1:50.22, with Dyer coming in less than a
second behind him at 1:59.11.

The Grinnell men also had standout
individual showings in other evenis. 1n the
400, KahenlaArmah '04 posted the third
fastest conference time this season (51.98),
ﬁnishing second. Additionally, Yaw Nu.

a lot ofsprinr guys who are doing well too,
especially in rhe 400 and we've got a really
good 4x4 [4x400rmﬂer relay, which took
third] I think Yaw was pretty elose to a
school record [only 2 seconds ofrthe 10.

year old mark held by Darren Young ’92}.
He was running really well, and that's early
in the season."

“Everybody's developing reallyguickly,"
said Unuroa '05. "our skill level is very
high. we should a he a top oompetitor in
the Midwest conference."

AS ream.orienred as the men's times

Nothing better than teamwork on a 13-inch TV

ive always liked the concept ofteamwork, When you're part ofa
team, you always have someone to depend on, someone to trnst,
someone to blame, it's that someone to blame thing that's the real
clincher for me,

Maybe it's because 1 enjoy the concept of the
team that 1 was so excited when a friend here an.
nounced that he had purchased a new hockey video
game. This was no ordinary hockey game, he use
sured me, this was one where words like “hits"
were spelled “l-1it1."Tli1s was also a
game that allowed three people to
play on the same team.

i needed no more convincing, [ma
mediatelyl ran over to my friend's room
where he, 1 and another friend picked up the eonrrols and started
playing,

The magic was pretty much instant. After ahour rite minute of
playing it was clear that the three ofus were meant to be one profes—
sional sports team ofsome sort lfany ofus had any athletic ability,
we probably would be what we lacked in ability, though we made
up in teamwork,

two balls, no strikes

Men 5 all

Some days are better than others. Less than 24 hours after a 128-
110 loss at Lawrence University friday night, the Crinnell men's basket.
ball team turned in one of its best performances of the season with a
143422 rout of Carroll College in Waukesha, Wis.

Gn'nnell buned 30 three-pointers against Carroll, two shy of its own
national record of32, set against Clarke College in 1997. Steve Moidlund
'04, who torched Carroll for 35 points Jan. 11, scored 33 in Saturday's
rematch, leading six Pioneers in double ﬁgures. The Madison, wis., nar
tive went 10.15 from behind the three-point arch and 3-3 from the free
throw line,

Zach Carlson '03 poured in a career-best 24 points with six assists
and Steve Wood '04, the Midwest Conference Co.Player of the Week.
added 22 points and seven assists. Ken Heiser’04 posted his ﬁrst doubler
double of the season with 15 points, 10 assists and seven steals.

Crinnell missed its ﬁrst six threerpoint attempts but never trailed
after Nordlund hit the team's ﬁrst at the 14:07 mark of the ﬁrst half. A
flurry of threes from Jim Shaw '03. Carlson and Mick Malinowski '04 gave
the Pioneers a modest seven-point advantage midway through the half,
but Mordlund hit threerpointeis on three consecutive possessions to
boost the lead to fourteen moments later. Gnnnell went 19.22 from the
free throw line and led by as many as 25 in the second half.

The Pioneers also shot well from threatpoint range (35 percent) in
the loss to lawrence but scored just two points in the last two minutes.
Lawrence made 10 of 12 free throws in the final two minutes and closed
the game on 217-2 run.

Cole Robertson '05 paced Crinnell with 21 points, his highest total
of the season, and Mordlund added 15. Malinowski, wood and Carlson
scored 13 apiece. Jason holinbeck and Ryan Gebler scored a combined
no points for lawrence and Kevin Cooper led all scorers with 33. The
Vikings held Wood to a season-low 12 shot attempts.

Although disappointing, the lossto Lawrence did not eliminate Grinr
nell from the post-Season hunt. Three Conference tournament spots re-
main open and the Pioneers (940, 0-5 MWC) are currently ﬁfth in the
league standings. The Pioneers host Monmouth Wednesday at 7:30 pm.

W0 en’s basketball

The Gn‘nnellwoman's basketball team played probably its best game
of the season in its ﬁrst meeting with Carroll, a 5950 less Jan. 11 at
Darby Gym. it was also a game in which Carroll, the Midwest Conference
pro-season favorite, looked sluggish from thestart. In Saturdays rematch
in Waukesha, Wig, a more focused [arroll squad handed Grinnell a 104-
43 defeat.

Carroll jumped out to a 19-point lead midway through the ﬁrst half
and steadily increased its lead throughout the game. Crinnell missed its
ﬁrst six shots, hitting iust six of 24 attempts in the ﬁrst half, but shot
a season-high 40 percent from the floor in the second half.

Curran Trick '0: scored nine of Grinnell’s ﬁrst 14 points and finished
with 14 in the game. Acnvi Coromelas '04 drained a threerpninter in the
closing seconds to ﬁnish with seven points while Jessica halverson '02
and Tai Duncan '04 added eight apiece. 0untan grabbed just three re.
bounds against Carroll but still ranks third in the conference with 7.3
rebounds per game.

Corey Crosskopf, currently the top scorer in the conference with
10.9 points per game, tallied 19 points for Carroll and Jill Gustafsofl led
all scorers with 25.

Grinnell lostto Lawrence University 6642 Friday night in Appleton,
Wis. Neither team shot the ball well but Lawrence scored 16 points off
20 Grinnell turnovers and led 30-14 at halftime. The Vikings put the
game away with a 17-2 run to start the second half.

Tnck grabbed nine rebounds, her best total of the season, and led
the Pioneers with seven points. Duncan and Marie 0psahhlister'03 com.
bined for 10 points and 10 rebounds in the post.

Although winless on the season, you can bet the Pioneer women
will continue to battle in the last four games of the campaign. GrinIIell

My video game hockey team is entirely different. i feel like a
valuable member ofthat team—a peer among peers. l'm not afraid
to step up and make a big play, or to miss a hit and fall on my video
game face. l'm not even afiaid to talk about my new team, heeausel
don't think people give wedgies at Grinncll.

1 can't believe I've been missing out on this wonderful sense of
camaraderie until now 1 always had some vague inkling that this
kind ofrhing happened when you were part ofa sports ream, hurl
never had any idea it could be this much fun. 1 just assumed the
entire football team are rneds together for the sole purpose ofscaring
other people, hut nowl realize they spend so much time together
because that's what reams do.

I guess 1 don't know about the foorhall posse, mostly because I'm
too afraid to go talk to them, bur when my team spends time to.
gether. it's quality rirne. we talk strategy as we eat dinner. we do
thumb workouts to limber up before games.

My team and 1 still have 20 orso games to play in ourseason.
T'm going to relish every one ofthose gameswith my brothers |nv
hockey.

That is, ofcourse, until my team goes on a losing streak. Then it’s
all my reanimares' fault.

Grinnell College swimming and dnnng cruised past Coe College last
Saturday in Cedar Rapids, the teams' ﬁnal tunerup before the Midwest

ﬁrstrplate finishes. Brian Clites ’05 swam a Seasomhest 10 5.55 in the

1000ryard freestyle and then won the 100 butterﬂy in .99. Darryl
Ncufcld '05 also won two events, the 200»yaid 1M 2: .99) and the

meter competition.

neerwomen will be favored to claim their fourth consecutive conference
crown after winning last years championship by over 200 points. The
men's team will be looking for its ﬁrst title since 1995.
