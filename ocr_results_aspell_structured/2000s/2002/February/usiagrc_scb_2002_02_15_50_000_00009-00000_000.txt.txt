For one thing, rI seems highly urrerhieal to make rhe

Rankings

Foao

Kate: 4/5: Great ribs, and a darn good soup/
salad bar.

Ara'el: 4/5. I left very full. In a good way.

SURROUNDIMES

Kate.- 3/5 Kind of apple overload for me,
although Brandon’s frosty mason jar beer
mug was pretty darn cool.

An‘er: 5/5, just for the neat atmosphere of
the place. Montezuma is a neat little town,
too.

VEGETARIAN

Kate: 2/5 Pooribut Anna survived the
experience intact. The green desert didn't
even hurt her.

Ariel: I'djust like to say—please see my

The ﬁrst thing rhar bears menrioning Is Ihe

been missing something, but I haven'r seen a good salad bar In
years. And by salad bar, I don't mean ieeberg lettuee and four

sauerkraut and beers. and my personal Iavorite, the bow ties
