Quad re-opens for Friday and Saturday '
lunch and dinner. For the first three ‘
weekends of the year, Quad was closed
from Friday dinnerto Sunday breakfast,
resulting in student complaints and a ,
shortage of seating at Cowles during
these weekends. Following last years
over—budget spending, dining services
suffered budget cuts this year which
also included reducing the number of
student employees working each meal
during the week. The cuts affected
many students receiving work study as
part of their ﬁnancial aid, as well as
non-student employees. Employees
also faced greater workloads as a re-
sult of the staff cuts.

Fire broke out in the Harris Center lounge
The fire, caused by a popcorn machine, re—
sulted in heavy damage to the lounge and
minor damage to the rest of the building.

Fireﬁghters from two neighboring local fire

departments, as well as the Grinnell fire de-
partrnerlt, worked on the ﬁre for about 50 min-
utes, and Cowles dining hall was closed early
as a precaution against smoke damage,
The building was cleaned extensively after the
ﬁre, and the lounge was closed for repairs.
Several campus events were moved or post—
poned, including the annual comingrout party,
which was moved to Vounker Lounge.

Fortunately, the Harris lounge is now back
and better than ever and is happily still a
source of free popcorn.

A consortium of Grinnell area churches and
college students made the decision to sponsor
two refugee families from Afghanistan. Stu,
dent laura Polstein '04 and Amy Graves, direcr
tor of the Community Service Center, attended
a meeting in Des Moines concerning the refue
gee program run by the Lutheran/catholic Cos
operative Refugee Resettlement Ministry. They
eventually held meetings for both students and
community members during which the decision
was made to move forward in the process of
sponsoring the families. Churches and students
planned to share the responsibility of provid-
ing help and support for the families.

The families were slated to arrive in early
November. However, due to recent US. restricc
tions and funding issues, it is uncertain when
or if the Afghani refugees will be coming to
Grinnell.

3 master in review: what youm

September 4

At an open forum, Tom Crady and
Steve larson and Jennifer Krohri pre
sented a review of the alcohol situr
ation on campus. changes in the
Grinnell college alcohol policy this
year stressed peer attention and in~
cluded several policy changes, in-
cluding the training of alcohol serv-
ers. Wristbands are now required for
those over 21 who wish to drink at
college-sponsored parties.

The changesin the alcohol policy
occurred after a survey last spring
found an increase in the level of
binge drinking among students. Fed-
eral law requires the implementation
or an alcohol policy, and any col-
lege not in compliance with this law
could stand to lose all federal fund»
lng.
