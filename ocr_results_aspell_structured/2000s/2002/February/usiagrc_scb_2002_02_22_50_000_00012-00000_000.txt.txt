Same DON’T like it hot

V I am calling attention to yet another problem on
campus: the bowl situation. Unless you attend a meal at
the very beginning of the designated mealtime, your
chances of getting a bowl that is at a temperature lower
than that which causes thirdrdegree burn: is slim to none.
This is, of course, making the oftentimes misguided
assumtion that you get a bowl at all. How many times
have you had your ice cream in a cone, when you just
didn't want a cone? 0r used the little plates instead of
bowls? And how many times has your ice cream melted
upon hitting the hot, hot bowl fresh from the dishwasher?
Really, how many times has your ice cream consumption
been satisfying? And how many homicidal rampage: have
you gone on as a result (the ones in your mind countl)?
Simple solution: buy more damn bowls!

To the freshmen

Yes, I know it is your ﬁrst year at Grinnell. I know you
are excited to be away from your parents'watchfuleyes.,1
know you want to party as hard and as loud as you can,
but guess what. "Hey, we're just freshmen; we'rejust hav-
ing fun," is not an all encompassing excuse. I and others
of my kind must live next door to you, and we are not
appreciative of your painstakingly collected array of ’805
White boy angst rap being blasted through our walls louder
than our own music in our own rooms. We have real classes,
vn'th real work, and we do live here, too. Use some com-
mon sense and decency and shut up,

Sometimes I play my stereo a little loud-Sometimes I

disrespectful of those living around me. But I never,

2. Decidethal my room layout is all wrong, and drag
