Diverse YGB
choir prepares
for next
semester

by Lola Garcia
Staff Writer

in 1967, six black first- year students garhercri in the
basement ofa Norm-campus riorrn and founded a gospel
choir, They took their name from/\fricanrAmencan writer
Lorraine Hansberry‘s phiuse “in be young, giircd,_ and
black."

This ycnr |l’ie Young, Gifted, and Black (YGB) choir
continues the tradition, Under faculty director Ralph
Russell, 35 sriidenrs come rogerhei ev
gospel music, The group you finished a successful series or
concerts, the tiaditional Fall Concert and the first ever
Gtinncll College Thanksgiving roiirerr. YGB has also pere
formed extensively in Grinnell, Cedar Rapids, and Des
Moines.

Next semester promises to be even more eventful. The
choir is raising a spring break rour rhrough several Sourhe
ern states, including Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri,
with a flnlsll in Chicago, They will also be performing in
several Des Moines churches and area shelters In the com»
ing monrhs.

Regardless ofd-ieit name the group is an iiirlusive one.
YGB members come from 15 different countries and are
of diverse racial backgrounds. Student leader loliliatliaii
Smith '03 says anyone can join “no long as you have rhe
heart to sing, and a lot ofenelgy"

A ﬁve student subset onGB called the “Praise Team"
also sings at Gtinnell's “Black Church." Once a month,
including this Sunday ar 10:30 am, students and orher
members of the college community gather ar Herrick
Chapel to celebrate a sen/ice in the African American Prote
usiant tradition, Ministers from the Des Moincs Associae
rion orBlack Minisreis usually rorare in, rhough increased
cfforis haye been made to bring in pasrors orcrinnellians'
hometowns. Next semester, students' home ministers will
be coming from Chicago, Alabama, and Philadelphia.

The two organizations have become increasingly im»
porraiir as the iiumher oiiiicoming Ari-lean American sm—
denrs has fallen off in i-eeenr years. The dimcrilry olrer
eriiiring srudeiirs to a town in Iowa which smith says has
“so few black cultural oiiuers" requires an even grcarer boost
in outlets on the campus itself. “Before I even came hei‘el
saw the name [Young Gifted. and Black], and knew it \vru
me" says Yvonne Palm '06.

While Black Church and YGB are touted as comfort
zones toiAtrican.American rruolciirs. participanrs aie qlllclt
to poinr out rhar the sorvire provides a more universal ex-
perience. “ [The groups are] an opporruiiiry ro iiiidersrand
the social institutions of religion among blacks for all
Grinneliians," says Latrislia Chamn '03, prcsidentofCon-
corned Black Students

Still, proyiding a eiiiriiral ourlcr torArricane/lrnerican
students remains a primary function ofborh Black Church
and YGB Says Smith: “As a student who came flom a

roumging, being “musical people," and have
helped ro pay for lessons with Dr. Sherida
Josephson ofthe Dcs Moincs Symphony.

Holley began to play wirh the college
orchestra in the fall onOOl. The previous
slimmer, she arroiideo a music camp or
Luther College, as she has for many years.
That summer was slightly different.
thoughithe Muslc Departments Doug
Diamond was the guest orchestra condure
tor.

As l-lolley held the position orvioia see
rion leader during the \veeklong music
camp, she got to know Diamond prerry
well, At the end ofthe filial concert, Dia-
mond discovered that Holley attends school
in Newton, and he extended her an invita—
tion to play with the roilege orchestra.
