“gay-friendly’ colleges in America. But does Glinnell live up to its reputation as a safe haven, and is that reputation even a factor for the gay and
lesbian students who do come to Grinnell? What factor does sexual orientation play in the lives of gay and lesbian Grinnellians’? What follows
are the stories and opinions of four very d‘rlTerent gay, lesbian, and bisexual students who try to answer these questions.

Dualistic thoughts

Raised in a liberal community, a bisexual hopes to educate Grinnell

Sabrina, a iunior, began rhe process oreoming
ro rerms wirh her biserualiry herore high school,
when she began ro realize she was different. “I made
our wirh my besr friend in middle school," she said.

The acrual acceprance or her bisexuality
srrerched over her early high school career because
she was “conhssed ar ﬁrst."

“I wouldnr deﬁne myselras bi [ar she rime],"
she said, even drough she would like a guy one day
and a girl anorher and ask herself, “Why iasnr I
deride."

Fortunately. when she did acknowledge her bi-
sexualiry, she had a srrong supporr system: she came
from a very liberal communiry, grew up in a very
aecepring Unirarian church, had parenrs who were
accepring or and friendships wrrh queers. and had
many queer acrivisr friends herselr.

These immediareaequainranoes provided a very
safe space for her in which ro come our Her family

She had always ralked ro her parenrs abour her
erushes, and when one morningshe came home ar

wirh a girl, “it was nor a surprise as rhem.”

Though Sabrina came from an environmenr
where her romanrie relarlonships were of no con-
sequence ro her friends and family, she did nor
choose crinnell based on a desire for a similar ser.

“People come ro Grinncll and rhink ir is rhe

“There are places where [homosexuality] doesri'r
have ro be a huge parr oryour consciousness. l wanr
[homosexuality] ro be boLh an issue and a none

musr remain an issue unril Grinnell becomes more
accepring.

Bur Sabrina is noi iusr inreresred in Grinnell
learning rrom her, she is also learning a lor from
Grinnell.

She has noticed a “rerrain cliquishness" in rhe
lesbian communiry. “My hair isn'rshorrandl don'r
wear rainbows so i don’r presenr queer enough,"
she said, “I wouldn'r be cenrral ro a queer commua
niry,”

Sabrina has learned a lor rrom rhe pasr experi»
enoes ororher lesbians and gays, however. "one of
rho grear rhings for me abour being queer here are
rhcir personal srories, which brings homophobia
oerhe newspaper page and inro my life, which is
really painful and really rewarding."

Sabrina also values Grinnell for an unexpected
reasoni “Part or why i am so appreciarive of
Grinnell," she sod, “is because i don’t wanr ro go
rhrough lrrewirhour knowing how privileged I was
[ar homel."

Ar home, Sabrina was nor seen only for her
orienrarion, “I don’r like rhe rerm bisexual," she
said. "It reduces a whole caregory of desires and
emorronsr power and connecrion. ro sex."

or she rerm," she said, “I like rhe rerm because ir rs
nor reductionulisti lr rs nor sinrplisrrc. lr leaves a lor
of room for orher racrors oridenriry."

As for her life arrer Grinncll, Sabrina considers
rhe well being or her enrire person hindsmenral.
“My seaualiry is nor disrinei rrom rhe resr or my
idenriry," she explained.

"lrs nor a parr in and orirselr I am one person,
so I. Sabrina, would nor choose ro live in an inrola
eranr place for airy variery or reasons, including my
sexual orienrarion."
