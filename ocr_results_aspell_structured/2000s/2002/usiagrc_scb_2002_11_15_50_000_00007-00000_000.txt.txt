The 25 cent condom machines on cam-

condoms. But students can get two tree
condoms a day from the Health Center. All
they have to do is ask

ing, though Director orthe Health Center
Karen Cochran estimated that around 260
students mmc into the Health Center for
condoms last year. Despite Cochran's asset»
rion that, “We're pretty easy to deal with, not
yndgmentai," studenu claimed to tool guilty
and embarrassed to request condoms at the
Health Centeri

“I gcnciallyciont like admitting my sexual

“The women [in the Health Center] are
way too nice," a yunior said, “On: feels guilty
asking them for condoms,”

“It's mthcr embarrassing [asking for
condoms at the Health Centci-l." one student
said. “I have to see the same two nurses when
I'm sick. Besides, they’re so sweet, I couldn’t
look them in the eyes the next time I was
there,"

“level otemharrassment definitely plays
air important role [when deciding where to
get condoiusl," one student said. “No one
wants to look like a slut.”

other students said asking for
condoms is no big deal

“once students have [gotten condoms once],
they come back," she said. “it’s not very in-

Still. some students thought making
condoms available outside the Health Cene
ter would be a good idea. “i think it would
be good to have condoms elsewhere on came

the distribution points giving some basics
about the ditreronccs between types and how
to best use one," said a First year,

“[Condomsshould be available] in a more

doesn't havc a sweet smile and that motherly
look that makes you feel guilty," a junior said.

“[I'd like] vending machines where you

Morning After Pills cost 330 (price in-

For women who want contraceptives
other than condoms, such as the Pill or the
contraceptive inicction Dope-Prevent, an
initial exam is requiied.

This visit, which includes a Pap smear,
hreasi examination, and other procedures
