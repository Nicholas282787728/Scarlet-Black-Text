Cone holding a challenge for student

Like the two year old who is proud of the mess that
he made in his diaper, a certain resident of Loose Pit
seems to revel in ”mess making" by daily (sometimes
twice daily) dropping ice cream cones in the loggia,
The two year old strives to grow up, and is praised
when he is ﬁnally able to use a "big boy' toilet, when
his actions can no longer be deemed ”messes." This
Grinnell student, however. insists on acting on some
desire to regress hack to pre-toilet trained toddlerdom
in which it’s fun to make a mess that someone else has
to clean up. But race it, you're in college now. No one
thinks this is runny, especially those who have to clean
it up, so get your head out of your ass and hold onto
your cone.

—A south campus resident

Another creative way to waste money

1am really glad that some higher-up round it in
his or her inﬁnite wisdom to lay sod on central Cams
pus early this week. It makes a lot of sense to me:
transplant sod during the last weeks of November so
it can freeze, not take root, and then have to be
replanted in the spring. Why not plant ﬂowers too, a
nice rose-bush in front of my house would be pretty»
at least until it DIED in a few days because DfWINTER
that is quickly approaching. Doesn’t the college have
better things to spend its money on? instead of tryr
ing to make the school better through fake grass,
why not do something more constructive: give us lots
ortree chocolate! That would make everything bet
ten So, random decision-making administrator, I'll be
waiting for my chocolate bought with the money you
obviously have to waste.
#Jancey Wickstram ’03

Finding time to ﬁght (mediocrity)?
Time. Something 1 always wish 1 had more at.
Never enough hours to finish all my work and get
enough sleep to stay healthy. Should I get good
grades by working hard all the time, not getting any
sleep, and ending up hopelessly ill or take the easy
way out by settling for mediocrity in everything that
I need to do. As the saying on one of my favorite
shirts says, ”When allelse tails, lowerynurstandards."
The real world doesn’t notice that child poverty isn’t
being alleviated by TANF, that slavew really didn’t
end in 1355 or that the Nixon Administration did
more to reduce poverty than the Kennedy AdminiSv
tration, The world is missing out. Unless I ﬁnd some

more time, I might end up missing out too, >
