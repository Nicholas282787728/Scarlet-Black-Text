Do the Math: Twenty seven people, only three show-
ers. Welcome to Read 2, every weekday morning. For
the moment, bathrooms are single sex, making that
division ﬁfteen guys, one converted bathtub. This
wouldn't be a problem it everyone else on the floor
subscribed to my group shower philosophy, but other
people have ”standards,” Plus, that showerwould make
you dirtier. Anyway, regardless of whether the bath-
rooms are coed or not, there's no way I can responsi-
bly get enough shower time prior to my a a.rn. Some-
times, I feel guilty using conditioner, and nobody
should feel guilty about restoring their hail’s natural
beauty. Who’s to blame? The easiest answer is the
sixteen ﬁrst years crammed like little ﬁshes into four
quads, but they keep telling me they have enough
stress with their ”insanely tough” tutorial homework,
SO I'll let it slide. For now.

Think of the children

You know what really gets my socks in a knot? Well.
I'll tell you. The fact that they have NO CHILDREN'S
BOOKS in the library knots my socks, man. What are
they thinking? Do you know how often I yearn to sit
and read a good kids’ book like Harriet the Spy or the
Lemony Snicketseries? Is ittoo much to ask that Burling
includes a few childrens’ books among their what, ﬁve
million other volumes?? Apparentlythey have the Harry
Potterbooks, but seriously, ifyou haven’t read the Harry
Potter books by now, then congratulations, you have
lived in a hole foryourentire life. Seriously though, for
those of us who are going to become childrens’ book
writers (wait... what do you mean I’m the only one?),
its nice to have some . .

Road related rages

Today I'm commenting on road rage and in effects
on society (i.e. me). We all know what it is and how
itinvolves elderly persons driving slowin the passing
Lane and ZO-something-year-old males that feel the
need to drive fasterthan the speed ofsound butthey
can't because the elderly persons are in the passing
lane which causes feelings of lage in everyone eke.
Then there's parking lot rage where people get into
their cars with what looks like the intent to leave but
they suddenly decide to sit in their cars blocking ,
perfectly good parking lots by doing something like
making dinner Ifyou ever do getin the grocery store,
beware of too-many-producrs-to-choose-irom rage. I
blame this on Tropicana and their 15 different kinds

of orangeiuice. I'd complain iiI wasn't making dinner
