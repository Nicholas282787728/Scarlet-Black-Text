Kathleen Skerrett, Religious Studies. She has the tilting voice of
an elementary school teacher and the vocabularly of a rocket
scientist (except with religion, not science),

—Mary Nelson ’02, Religious Studies

Pip Gordon Theatre, because she can be scary and makes you get
up and go to class no matter hell or high water.
—Jayn Bailey ’05, Undeclared

Johanna Meehan, Philosophy. The nicest neurotic you'll ever meet.
She’s like a more intellectual version of everyone's mother.
Bill Patch, History, has an unbelievable amount of energy and
enthusiasm for France’s Third Republic, a government that col-
lapsed over 60 years ago. Very entertaining to watch in class,
especially when he leaps about the room. ,

4eﬁery Bergman o3, Philopsophy

Tom Moore, Math. In my opinion, the deﬁnition of an excellent
teacher is someone who can transform a subject the student pre
viously disdained into something both entertaining and intrinsi-
cally worthwhile. Prof. Moore was able to do this for me with
Calculus: he made Calculus one of the highlights of my ﬁrst see
mester at Grinnell through his humor, knowledge and obvious
love of both his subject and his students.

#Kyle Marquardt ’05, Undeclared

George Drake, History, is by far my favorite prof. because he'sjust
the smartest person ever. I think what makes him so amazing is
his willingness to help. I went in with a page of questions and
random words irorn my reading andjust rattled them off. He knew
every answer and if he was unsure, he looked it up (although he
was right every time without consulting the books).

—lerghton Aycock ’04, History

Monessa Cummins, Classics, for Intro, to Humanities. Cummins is
the most intense pror. I've had yet. I, for one, enjoy the chal-
lenge of her intensity and have made quite a bit of progress as a
writer and speaker under her scrutiny. As for the class material,
I've found Greeek epic and tragedy to almost live up to their
praise A doing so completely would be impossible, as the Greeks
have been ridiculously over-idealized by so many.

7001/5 Clark, ’05, Undeclared

Victoria Brown, History. She's spunky as all hell and will do any
thing she can to help you learn, You can’t find another prof. who
cares more about her students’ lives. She’s a gem,

iDenny David '03, Religious Studies

rJohn Mohan, Russian. Not till you take a class with Mr, Mohan
will you know the beauty of Russian literature. '

Maybe it’s because I'm a dorky History major, but I really liked
Sarah Purcell’s seminar on popular politics. She’s energetic and
really knows how to lead a discussion. The only danger is that_
sometimes you move in your seat and she_ thinks you want to say
something, but it means you always get a chance to talk.

—Eril< Gable ’02, Histon/ ,

Combinatorics is one of the best classes that I have had here. It .
is a class whose object is simply to count things: how many ways
can you arrange these books on a shelf? How many ways can you
partition 3 set of indistiguishable items? It is fun, like playing
games ,
‘VLagon Axon '03, Math

CultualClitique with Alan Schrift, Philosophy. This classis Schrift’s
baby , and is the best class I have ever taken The syllabus is
hard, but you are reading a signiﬁcant number of the most im~ '
portant philosophical texts or the last 150 years.

—Dave Chenault, ’03, History

Human Sexuality is a great class because who doesn't enjoy read-
ing about the merits or sex? Also, Ithinkxit’s a very important
Class , I’ve learned a lot of important oniormation that I think
more people should know,

— leighton Aycock, '04, Histoy

Central and Eastern European Literature with Todd Armstrong,
Russian. Armstrong is veny knowledgeable about the region and
speaks several Slavic languages. The class is a yew interesting
exploration of this region’s literature and film

iRashed Chowdhury ’03, Independent Major

Electronics. This is the only practical physics class offered at Grins
nell. You learn how to build all sorts of awesome devices, like an
alarm clock that keeps accurate time and a remote control car you
control with a computer.
