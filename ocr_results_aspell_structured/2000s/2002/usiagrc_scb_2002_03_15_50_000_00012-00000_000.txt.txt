Taking rue 2tr

The content ofihis column has been said before, and in a much
more eloquent manner man I will say ir, bur as or leasr parr arrhe
reason I wrire rhis column is ro ger rhings rhar anger me on
my chase In rhe case of rhe lerrer announcing Grinnell's
laresr ruririon hike, die angering iaeror is th: line in rlae lasr
paragraph where Presidenr Osgood assens rhar "we appree
ciare how everyone reels when we inc.ease our comprehane
sive fee and seek inuuscd conrriburions from our alumni
and friends." somehow, rhis laresr increase makes me call
rhar inro doubt.

Now, it’s rrue rharl haven‘r raken economies
ar rhis school, bur 1 do realize rliarsomerhing like
a nillaourruirion ireere would nor be feasible, given ,
inilarion and she need ro increase Faculty andsralir
salaries ro reﬂecr said inﬂarion. Likewise, 1 would
like ro see a guaranree rliar srudenrs pay rhe same comprehensive fee
for all fouryears regardless uffurrhcr increases, bur in rhis economyl
don’t see rhar happening cirher. However. a 5.5 percenr comprehcn»
sive ice incrmse on wire heels of a 7.5 pcreenr increase lasr year is
absolurely obsoene.

When 1 was applying ro schools. I was given aeeeprance ro a
number ofGrinncll’s “peer institutions,” bur chose rhis school par.
rially because ofa generous merir scholarship package rhar made ir
possible for me ro arrend regardless ofmy pasirion in rhe “middle
dis squem.” A lirrle more rhan rwo ymxs later, ruirion has been
raised almosr mob and rhose merir scholarships remain sraric.
My ﬁmﬂysdll does nor "demonsrrare need,” which means rhar we
have ro ear rhose incrwm.

Grinnell is still wirhin my abiliry ro pay {or iz—barelyiso rhese
increases mean only rhar I’ll have rhar much more in sruclenr loans
by rhe end. But chere are cerrainly thus: srudenrs who have my prob.

Lasr year's lerrer said rhar rhe rarlier sizable fee incrmse was
only ro corrccr {or she small increases oryears pasr, and rhai hope»
fully ir would preclude any further dramaric jumps. Clearly. rhis
was nor rhe ease. Moreover, a similar sraremcnr is conspicuously

absenr from rliis year's edirion. an omission which sensb my
cynicism inro overdrive,

The lerrer poinrs our rhar

Gilnncll's comprehensive ice is

peer insururions’ recs. Making

a comparison like rhis is similar ro saying rhar being decapirared is 90
percenr less painful rhan being burned ar rhcsrakFyou'resrill dead.
or broke, as rhe case may be. Why is rhis adminisrrarion obsessed
wirh peer institutions? ls meresomerhlng wrong with being good on
ones own merits?

Argumenu like rhis one have been called “nearsighred" in the
recenr pasr. The reasoning is rhar rhe ruirion increases now will make
Grinnell more financially solvenr in rhe iurure, and rhus requesrs ro
keep ruirion law an only hurr rhe school in die future. However, i
have an extremely hard rirne believing rhar ehis insrirurion is as dcsri.
rure as ir makes inelfour ro be.

No. I’m nor suggesung that rhe school spend irs endowmenrwillye
nillyiTI-IAT would be a nearsighredplan ofacrion. However, she
inreresr on said endowmenr alone is a fairly sizable sum of money.
and an informed, merered spending oirhai money would help rlie

affordable for rhe srudenrs conrriburing a roral or more rhan $36
million in ruiuon every year.

Moreover, speaking ofncarsighiedness, srudenrs embirrered by
such rapid ruirion hikes evenrually become alumni embiererod by
rapid ruirion hikes, and as such when ir come rrme ro give back ro
rhe alma marer, said
alumni may decide rhar
$120,000 is quire
enough ro pay, rhank
you. Srudenrruirion will
always be rhere, bur
alumni conrriburions
are much less cerrain.
and rhe college cannor
really afford ro aliensre
rhis group in rhe race of
such a “special chal—
Icngc."

I applaud rhe ap.
pornrmenr ora srudenr
represenrarive ro rhe budger sreering commirraa, and 1 only hope
rhar rhe srudenr's opinions will be raken inro considerarion, because
air is essenc: Grinncll is here because ofthe srudenrs. Ifsiudcnr cone
eems are ignored, rhe college will have failed or in mosr obviom
mission.

Ir ls fuiilc ro rry ro keep ruirion mnstant rhroughour a srudenr's

Making a comparison like
this is similar to saying
that being decapitated is
90 percent less painful
than being burned at the
stake—you're still dead, or

broke, as the case may be.
