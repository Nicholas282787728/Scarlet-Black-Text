B The one good winter movie that I
missed, besides Snow Dogs. Halle Berry

i—iank (Billy BobThornton), awhite prison
guard who will execute her exehusband
(Sean Combs), Raeism abounds in this
Georgia ﬁlm, mueh of it emerging from
Hank's bigoted father Buck
(Peter Boyle).

l: Damn Brad, we are
not doing so well. For
all you fans out there,
we didn't see this
movie so we are on
the same level
as you: Since I
don't have any
thing to say
about this, 1 will
tell you what wiuw.niai/icnzani.£oln says
about it. Apparently this is a ﬁlm for people
13 and olderas it remains “extremely strong
language, very explieitsexuaisituations iihis
must he i-ialle Berrys full frontal nudityl],

good film, for the appropriate niidlcncca

however, Mom goes on to
give us tips regarding a me

Brad’s ﬁnal her: any movie that make

Black Hawk Down (R)

nglinc' leave no man behind.

starring: Young ObieWnn, Trip
Fontaine, Legolas.

l: I paid $10 to see this movie in Bos-
ton, l’m still iiotsiire ifit was worth it. The
ﬁlm is about the Get. 3, 1993 mission of
elite U.S. iiiilitaryforees in Somalia. What
begins as a standard ﬁeld op to upml'c So-
mali lieutenants is turned into a bloody
battle between hundreds ofSoniali gunmen
and a sparse few Americans, The movie is

looking for a story, this is nor the ﬁlm to go
to. BHD deals with war with very realisrie
einematogiaphy. but the plot (minus the
oh.so.hoi men) is a little lacking.

B: A few weeks ago, a trailer for WeWrne

Brad’s ultimate urging: ifyou are dying

Being abonormal is perfectly normal

Keeping your mental health during Hell Week is impossible, so you might as well work with your new and interesting disorders

1 have my ﬁnger on me pulse ofthis mmpus. No, 1 don’t. hurl
did go to the Forum today, and overheard a few groups ofstudents
talking while i was in line for my big eookie. Most ofthe conveisa.
tions were along these lines: “I’ll never make it
through Hell week without going eraay,"
“This elm is driving me insane," and “Al-thhhh
Ha Ha Ha! i’m a bunny! i'm the President of
the World! My brain travels through time and
space in an egg miton!"

These are normal feelings to
have during theend orthe term, or ' ‘
at least that's what ward orderlies '
told me before strapping me down
and sedating me. when you come
down to it, you ain't possibly make it through Hell week without
going insane. There is no way, you've got seminar papers, exams,
poster presentations, and all those freakin' take-homes, not to mane
tion that you also have to puek everyihing that you own.

But don't start pulling your hair out and listening to the voids in
your head just yet; there's still a little hope. Mental illnesses ntn tome
in handyduiing these rough times; you inst have to know whieh one
to piek and how to use it. it's like that saying goes, ifiire gives you
lemons, all them aliens, stiek them in your ears, and run around

Paranoid Sehizophrenia. Thinking that
