Another side to
beanbag 'story

DmrSdB.

lasr week, gum columnist Michael Andersen wrore an arriele
enrirled “Gaining Beanbag Discourse,” an aecounr ofan ineidenr in
which a srudenr removed a beanbag from rhe Forum, placed ir in a
nearby iree, and sai againsr is. Thaisiudeni was me, and I would like
ro add my own eornmenrs regarding rhis episode.

Anduscn’s inrerpreraiion of rhis eveni and its impliearions for
our policy shelf-governance was a wellrwordzd and inreresring read.
I was quite disappoinred. however, by his caregorical misrepresenra.
rion ofmy srarernenrs and anirudes, alrhough ro derive sophisiiraied
discourse from such an innocenr and insigniflmnt evenr would eere
sainly require some imaginarion, and indeed Andersen showeda grear
deal, In many cases, he simply fabrieaied siasemenis and arrribuied
rhem ro me. ii is nor my inienrion here ro fuss over derails or so
furrher defend my characrer or my aerions, nor is ir ro eririeiae
Andersen's aniole. I was inspired by his decision io bring aspeers of
rhis event to she communiry’s anenrion, and l would like ro do ihe
same.

Thar nighr, afrer Mr, Anderson expressed his eoneerns regarding
my rreasrneni of rhe beanbag, his friend earne our from ihe Fotum
South Lounge ro share her own disrurbing view. She asked ifl Tar
ceived financial assisranoe in order (a aiiend Grinnell, and when l
rold her I did, she explained rhar she paid full ruinon, and ihercforc
rhe bianbag was more hers ihan mine. Since ihe beanbag belonged
more ro her rhan ir did or me, she demanded rharl remove n from

Her perspecrive rroubles me greaily. and ihe danger is inhcr.

80 pereenr of siudenrs receive rinaneial aid, is self—evidenr, We
imagine ourselves ro be a eomrnuniiy in which elass disrincnons

Two areas of parricular impoverishmenr seem ro erupi in ihe
respecrive realms of erearive wriiing and danre. ln ihe realm of
crearive wriring, malnourishrnenr does nor seem so spring so much

from lack of resourees as from lack ofeommirinenr. The profes—
sors equipped ro reach ciearive wriring are vibranr and eager, rhe
Wriiers' Workshop is a mere hour away. However, rhe lack of
psychologieal suppori ihai srudenrs receive has a disabling effecr.
In a sehool where siudenis can major in srudio arr, innsic perfor—
manee, and do quim a bit of arrisrie explorarion in rhearre, why
eai-i'r srudenrs rakermoic ihan a few classes in erearive writing?
Why is rhere no mayor? And why are we lerring Mark Baechrcl,
our one fulletime Wntlllg professor, go?

In ihe realm of dance, rnalnourishrncnr is moving rowards
