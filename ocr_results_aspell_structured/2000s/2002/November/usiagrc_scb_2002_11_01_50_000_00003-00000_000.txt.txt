Rape accusation rejected by court

 

After a Grinnellian goes off-campus

by Leslie Boyadian
Staff Writer

Over fall break Kristen Kesslcr :03 got to bring some closure to an
event which occurred a little over a year and a half ago. on rhc night of
March IO, 2001, the annual Harris Disco parry, Kcsslcrdrank Some alco.
hol and blacked out. During this time, Kcssler says that she was Sexually
assaulted by fellow Student Mike Overvold.

Kesslcr had been dating overvold earlier in the year. However, they
had not been dating for over a month prior to the incidcnr and she says
that they had never had a sexual relationship, The morning arici Disco,
Ovcrvold rold Kesxlcr (in! they’d had sex, but Kcsslcr Said sh: didn't re-
rncmbor ivliar had happened. She said, “ [I only rcmcmhcri waking up 9
hours later land] asking hundreds oigucsrions over the next week trying to
figure out \vhar happened [that nighrl."

The week after Disco Kessler left for spring break and took the resr of
the your of? on medical leave because of rhe Inctdcnr. She did, however,
bring the Incidcnr to rhe arrenrion ofjen Krohn, Dean for Student Life
and then to the crinncll police.

Kcsslcr dccidcd char she wanted to pursue justlcc through rhc state
courts, insrcad ofseeking it through the college yudicial process. Under the
collcgc system, rhesrrongcst disciplinary ucrion Overvold would have faced
would have been expulsion. She said that she didn’t feel that the college was
in a position to do rhc iob that she wanted done in respect to investigating

rhe incident and disciplining her assailant. At the end oirhc year, Overvold
transferred to Lawrence University without punishment from Grinnell,

Kessler based her decision to pursue legal ramifications on her asser-
tion of rho scvcriry of the crime. “Rape is a dangerous act,” she said. “I
don’t feel rhar it’s appropriate for the college to be involved in punishing
serious criminal acts."

Keeler said that the college needs to change its judicial sysrcm regard
ing how it handles cascs of rape on campus. She said, “Because rape is a
rraiiinaric cinorional issue and there are legal ramifications for rape, the
college nccds a system where it's clear to a victim that there is an avenue for
conﬁdciicial information in an advocacy format and some sort uiguidance
regarding [the victim's] pursuit of rectifying any inequities."

“Ir’s absurd for the college to be involved in piosccuring felonies," Kcssler
said.

After Kesslcr spoke with scrgcani Randall Hansscn of the Grinnoll
Police Department, the CounryAriorney decided to press charges. Overvold
submitted a plea bargain, which was determined by rho County Arromcy
to be too lcnienr. The County Attorney diaircd a now version orthc bare
gain: Overvald would have had in roll a judge ivhar he'd done, and would
have been convicted ofan aggravated misdemeanor, He would have boon
placed on probation, required to seek counseling, and been rcgisrored as a
sex offender.

Another way Moiicct hopes to serve Poivcsliiek resi-
dcnrs is through increased access ro social services, espc.
cinlly rhosc involving mental health and people with dis.
abilities. According to Motion, Powcshick currently ranks
below most counties in Iowa in terms of providing such
services.

out to budget curs in the past year, some pain ofche

loss of driver’s license renewal services in Grinncll, Mochtr
said, “I'm anxious to see how we can bring certain services
back. I’d like re use ifwc can spend more vviscly and bring
new income inro Grinncll," ‘

regulations. He expressed concern regarding rhc environ»
mental impact ofmass livestock corporations such as the
nearby Frccmonr Farms. The egg producers were recently
given permission by the store to double their livesroclc hold-
ings to 5.2 million chickens,

“I'm very inremrcd in ways to preserve our environc
menr," Molten said. “Most of the livestock regulations
come from the state, rather than the county. I’d like to
change things so rhere’s more local control."

Morton‘s interest in conservation srcms from his ap-
preciation oi the local landscape. He admits that when he
first arrived in Iowa, he didn't expect ro stay for very long
because the scenery seemed much more mundane than
the mountains and beaches of North Carolina. He soon
discovered the more subtle beauty ofthc plains, however,
and he hopes to help others to discover it .u well.

“I‘m really rouchcd by the beauty ofthe surrounding
area,” Mofferr said. “I‘d like to increase community pride
and appreciation oiihc positive aspects oiivhcre we live."

Though Motion has found a good deal piraculcy and
strident support |n his bid for county supervisor, he re.
inains philosophical about rhc election results. “when I
got into the race," he said, “I fclr whether I won or losr I'd
be able to make my opinion known."
