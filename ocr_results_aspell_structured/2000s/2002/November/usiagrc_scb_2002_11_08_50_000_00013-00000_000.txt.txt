And now for your oral

samh aswell

My firss oial presenrasion is coming up ness week. l
hnd oial pieseiirasions much harder to do men so wi-ise
papers, because when a reaches is grading my paper, I'm
nor rhere so see she horrified look on her cice, whereas
when 1 am giving an ineclass reporr, I'm looking righr as
she her horrified face, and she shings rhas 1 say make is
swiss and redden wish pain. My plan is so awais she inven,
sion and produesion or an android so lifelike in speech,
movement. and countenance rhas is could be programmed
so give a flawless presensarion for me. However, ifyou don‘i
have as much confidence in science and technology as i
do, you can just bullshn shrough is wish you real human
body, like I usually do. Her: are my rips:

speak clearly and ardculasely enunciase. Eisher rhas,
or mumble, is really depends on whesher or nos you know
whas you‘re salking abous. For example, I like so enunciase
sheconinnesions and arsicles, and mumble she nouns, verbs.
and dehnirive srareincnss.

Per usual, hide your shesis. Hiding your shesis is much
harder in an oral pserensasion shen in a papei l ssrggess
shree shings: qualify, qualify, synaliry. Foruxnmple, ifynur
shesis were “Kittens are cure" (let's say he lnsro see. here)
you would say, “Alrhough kirsens are core, we have so con»
sider she social, economic, and hissorie implicasions or . ..

Okay, so maybe you're rhinking I need so re»

beans 1 began sighs away I labeled my friends,

I labeled several RLcs, 1 even labeled she
label maker itself. EMILY’S LABEL
MAKER, l creasively labeled is.
orcourse, npon rnrrhes reflecsiou.
I re ‘ d esacsly how ironic sbis bingo

The second reason sbar rhe label maker was an ironic
pill: is rhas nioss Grinncllians luttc labels, i mean, don's
shey eiease social problems shrough ihe psomosion ofsre»
rcorypcs? lmmedusely I realized shas somcshing had so be
done before shings gos our ofconsroi and rhas is how she
label maker came so follow me home so NchorkCiry for

Aries all. slierc are near people in New York. Like my

shough sonie son of messy presence has iuss packed up

much ado about nothing

and headed halfway across she eounsry or someshing like
rhas. Anyway, mysisser used is first, she labeled me EMILY,
in ease anyone forgos who I was. i resurned she favor and
labeled her HAYLEY, because rhas is her name. Then she
assempred so label she ear LAPTOP, because rhas is his
name, bur he apparensly has a Grinncllian assisude (or
ward labels, because he rerseased under she bed when
she rried so ssick she lirsle plassic label on him.
Fall break also broughs a series or new belongc
ings, including a correemakes (which my roommase
named EMILY’S LEGAL ADDICTIVE STIMU-

It’s soo addicrive, like my coffee. As all she piesures on my
wall slowly acquire capsions and I masses ihe arr orchaiige

more and more hooked. And yet again, l realise she irony
orshe sisuasion. Because crinnell just supplied me wish a

Let there be light! Please!

We're all sick of the mud. Heating and cooling cone
struction is still ovenrvhelming the campus, months
overdue. The mud stains clothing and ruins shoes, but
there is another problem: safety!

Walking to north campus last week, I tripped over
construction scraps left next to the [lain tracks by
Darby,.. because it was too dark to see them! I fell
face-ﬁrst and ended up with several cuts and scrapes.
(Too bad 1 wasn't really hurt; it might have been my
only chance to fund the $30,000 I'ln paying to put up
with this bullshit!)

Most lighting poles have been removed near the
construction areas, without replacement. I wish our
esteemed institution had enough common sense to
re-light the construction areas (as if leaving materials
and machinery in the open weren’t already dangerous
and illegal enough). To anyone who cares, please
replace the lightingl iﬂn'an Elite: '05

Watching history play out

If Nabokol/s Lolita is a metaphor for EurocAmeri—
can relations—by which I mean Humbert (Europe)
sought to seduce Lolita (America) only to tind him-
self the one seducedithat would, perhaps, explain
something about how histony may unravel in the com
ing year. Europeans (and I exclude Britain) have long
thought a war against Iraq ill conceived. Indeed, the
Germans swept Gerhard Schroeder clean into ofﬁce
almost solely on account of his anticwar policies. The
French and Italians too have protested, and made
deman , hoping that we might indulge in European
sensibi ty. But once again we stand in the position
to seduce the oldsworld; the Europeans will consent...
ﬁrst their airspace, and then their troops. How could
they possibly resist our monstrous economy, the irre-
sistible popsculture, or the vast landscape? They need
us and we know it, should we not be ashamed of

ourselves? iDEVi-d Archer ’05
