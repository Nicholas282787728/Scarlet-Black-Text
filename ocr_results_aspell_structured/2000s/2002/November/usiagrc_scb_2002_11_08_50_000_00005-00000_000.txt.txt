SELF-GOVERNANCE

a thing of the past?
SGA VP proposes

The state of
self-governance

by Kennedy Leavens
Staff Writer

“Selfcgovetmnce isn't dead,” Pat Mldtlyng, ‘03, be-
lieves. “But it is deﬁnitely on the decline,” He is ill good
company. From upperclassmen to recent alums, sena—
tors, and even an RLC, many on campus are noticing a
change, especially at social gatherings where alcohol is
available. Most point to sometime about three years ago
as a turning point in the way telegovernancc is (otisn’tl
practiced.

Brandon Zicha, '02 5, said that ill that time period
he has seen a signiﬁcant change in the way people treat
each other. For example, he said that his freshman year,
“it’d be really hard to Find someone drunk and by |ltcmr
selves." but he feels that now, students don't can: for
each other as well. “People just don't think about stir.
governance, don't take it serlously, as 1 feel it once was,"
he explained.

become more destructive," and oth»

being thrown on the loggia and
vending machines being defaced.

Their concerns are backed up

dent Affairs and the Board ofTiust-
ecs. somethingsecms to have changed; however, no one
really knows why

Many attributed this change to a shift in attitudes
towards sclcgovemanee in incoming classes. RLC Jen
Green, among others, mentioned a need to emphasite
the meaning and importance ofselfrgovetnance to new
students. “I feel like we need to do better education about
what self-governance is," she said,

Midtlyng echoes her concern: “People are takingselr.
governance to mean. ‘I am governing myseir', andwhai
it is is a social philosophy through which we all become
better citizens through interacting and caring for one
anothcri," he said, “I don’t see self-governance being used
in that way anymore."

Asked whether the principles ofself-governance had
been explained to him, ﬁrstayeztr Dave weimar said, “I
don’t think it’s been clearly deﬁned to the freshman
body...i have a rough sketch orthe idca but the details
orthe system are a mystery.”

Brian Lawson, also ’06, said. “I suppose they talked
about it, but i think it is pierry self-explanatory" Hc,
along with about halfofﬁrst-years interviewed, deﬁned
selrgoveinance as being responsible rot ouc‘r own acr
rions and making inielligent choices. Few emphasized
the importance orcarmg tor the rest orthc community
as well, which is by most accounts a necessity if self-
goveruance is going to work.

"There are always ques-
tions about self-gover-
nance in order to keep
self-governance going we
have to continue ques—
tioning it, sharing it, and
modeling it.‘
—Jennifer Kro/in,
Associate Dean of

Additionally, many wondered irrhe values orincoin.
ing students had shifted, whether due to “changing
times, changing inentalities," as Midrlyng put it, or a
change in the type orsrudcnt that crinnell attracts, as
others, such as Brad Yi, '03, suspect.

vi mentioned a new admission policy, instituted a
few years ago, which required that Grinnell enroll a
higher percentage orstudenrs paying full tuition. Dean
orAdmissions iim Sumner conﬁrmed the adoption or
this policy, which he said was aimed towards increasing
“socioeconomic diversity."

orr economically. Yi believes this tactic accoiiurs for a
“demographicshirt" in incomingsriidenrs that may have
contributed to changing attitudes in the student body.

Last year's new alcohol policy
was also blamed.

The policy requires students
who ivant to serve alcohol at a
party to register the party before
Friday at rive, to hire a trained
server, and to regulate underage
drinking with Wristbands.

it was implemented at a time
when the number or incbriated
students sent to the hospital had
increased sharply, from near zero.
by most accounts, to three or roar
in a year.

The policy was adopted partly
because orconcerns about insur—
ance costs and liability, according
to various administrators, and
partly because in an environment
with little structure, freedoms given to students were
getting abused. according to RLC icn crecn.

According to zicha, the effect orthis policy has been
to make it rat more difficult to have a party in a dorm
lounge, and therefore, has driven alcohol consumption

He called the policy a “reactionary" measure that, in
pushing parties oircampus, has made them “less social,
which makes it less supervised," Moreover, he argues,

rion that gave rise to its adoption, “If they were really
concerned about student health," zicha said, "they
would look into what is actually happening and stop

However, not all agree that there is a problem with
the way self-governance is practiced. Rather, they argue

changes to
governance policy

McGranahan advocates for increased student
participation in judicial procedures and
punishments for the violation of community rules

Student Government Vice President
Devan McGramthan does not think his
idea is all that new.

He has led a recent push to reform

proposal would adhere to the policies set
forth in the student handbook. “When I
started talking about this, even I used the
term ‘radical new idea."Y he said. “What
really is the radical new idea is actually
using [the student iodiciary processi."

Despite its roots the proposal is a
change to the college policy and its judic
cial process. McGranahan suggests two
main changes. In presenr term the hand
book contains 20 “actions that violate the
general community.” Mccranahan pro.
poses adding a new
action to a list that

others: it would add
“violation orcampus
social policy" to the
list ofdetriinental ac-
nous.

The deﬁnition of
a “campus social
policy" could make
or break the proposal.
According to McGranahan representa—
tives from the residence life told him that
“if you were to establish a deﬁnition...
then this could be added to the list.”

The idea orcainpus social policy came
to McGranahan after a pair of incidents
that he saw as rhrears to “campus social
life." Namely: the police encounter with
a belligerently drunk student at High
street last month, and the campus bikes
being thrown orra loggia during the ion
10 weekend parties.

“As it it now. he wasnt violating any

here on campus: either the college Hearr
ing Board, Judicial Council, the Alcohol
and Drug Council, or the Computer/
Telephone council. Each hearing board
has representatives from the students,
start, and raculty.

Mccranahan sees this power in this
process as “being heavily tilted towards
the administration,” which is why he
wants one or the hearing boards to take
