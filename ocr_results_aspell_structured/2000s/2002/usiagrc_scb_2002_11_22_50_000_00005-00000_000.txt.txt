Flights of

fantasy

Talking animals, martial ads, and depression musicals

Jeremy: look: like Films CharrTony o Pham midtd
the video store. After last weekends strong lineup at Hare
us, the two movies this week have some high especrations
to live up to. And they hill, one good thing 1 tan say about
these movies is that they don't require mueh error. on the
part ofthe audience, and at this point in the .ntsttr the
kind of effort a good art film requires is usually reserved
for things like finishing papers, drinking heavily, and get»
ting out ofbcd.

just said.

B: (sedge, this year’s top grossing animated movie. is a
sharp mix of slapstiek and beautiful frozen landscapes. A

J: 1 can think of
onlyone reason to see
this movie- Denis Leary. I
brieﬂy ﬂirted with the idea ofseeing this, but something
shiny on the ground distracted me for those 85 minutes.
A number oferitio liked the movie, saying it was fun and
heart-warming, an :njoyzble fantasy geared to children,
others condemned it as derivative, too childish, boring,
and a sad rip—effofhoth the superb Montana, Ins. and the
uninspiring Sloth. But my favorite review claimed [rt/lg:

_r2mc “closer than any other recent animated ﬁlm to the
£00719 Iirner ideal” (San Francisco Chronicle). Somehow
that doesn't ring too positively with me.

E: Jeremy, you're wrong. While this movie doesn't reach
the emotional or technical heights ofMontreis, Int, it still
is a worthwhile creation. I should mention its stunning
use oflight and shadow on the icy terrain. but mainlywant
to sriek with the story aspectst The plot is simple, and

this film of the “true story"

This ale starts two years after the Beast started its sprcet
The King sends Fronsac, a tough naturalist, and Mani, his
Mohawk sidekiek, to Gevaudan to kill the beast. in
cevaudan, Fionsae is smitten with the wealthy Mariano
De Momngias, but, like any good Frenchman, has a mis-
tress, too. When the King gets fed up with anny and
Mani’s inability to catch the Beast, he sends Lt. Antoine de
Beauterne to finish the job. And once the lieutenantshows

mYou asked me onm,’ said O'Brien, ‘what wan in Room
101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Every
one knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst
thing in the world.“ —George Orwell, 1984

“Room 101 contains your greatest fear. it's the place
where morality has no meaning for you anymore," sum.
marized David Radar '04, When asked if his rock show,
“What's in Room 101?" lives up to its foreboding name,
Rader smiled and said, “I'll leave that up to the listener to
decide." Rader, who eloses Kchs Monday line up, has
no qualms abour the wildcard 12.2 am. time slot. “it's
nice because more people listen at night then would dur.
ing the middle ofthe day. Al 10 in the morning, nobody’s
going to be listening bccnllse they're in class, or something,"

he said, adding, “I like it because, dortt tcll speneer this,
but i ran break all sorts of rules without anyone knowing
about it." Rader's friends, however. have failed to see the
timeslot’s allure, as, “I wanted my sormllcd friends to come

dismissive, pretentious commentary
on the musicibut 1 guess the in

people to rust want to eome in and

While currently in his ScmndScA
mesrer at the station, Rader had little
initial interest in becoming a DJ.
“Originally, ldrdn't feel like having
a show, myself, but i started hang.

decided that i might as well get my
