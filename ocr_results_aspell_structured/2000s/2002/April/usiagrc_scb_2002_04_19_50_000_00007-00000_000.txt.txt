“Sons ofoid Gunncli, let your voices meil‘"

Sn L‘XhOi’l’Cd J. Norman Hall, class 01'1910, in one ofGrinncll College's
old ﬁght songs, “Sons oFOid Grinncll,"

Fight songs, elsss hymns, nnd duties both prideful nnd irrevercnr were
common around the turn olrhe century, and their lyrics—preserved in
the college amhiveoireﬂect tho culturc orthe time.

Alice Phelps '12 responded to Hall’s song with her own “Doughters of
Old Grinnell." It might have been an early lndimtion ofGrinnell stu-
denn' emerging gender polities, but nnothet songwriter moelted pnglcS-
sivc women In "Th: New Woman," a satirical number in which he dc-
pioted strong women shrieking in horror at the sight on mouse.

The most common them: in songs by turnrof-rhc—ccntury Grinnell
Sludcnis, however, was pride in their alma mater. “Sing to the tollege with
bnuner so bright," ran one, “o sing to the sarlet and hittls.” An 1896
song poyed tribute to “the eollege first {and in the west” where “study
and music we mingle with fun,"

We’ve culledscvcml orrhe besrorcnnneil’s old songs from the Burling
Library orthiyes and Compiled them here re. your tending pleasure.

in former da '5 which many ptmse, when people wanted knowledge,
The girls we sent to bondingsehool, the boys they went to college.
A {log in the mtirsh, tho’ his voice was harsh, rook m the situation;
“Cured, co-cd, cured,” he said; he meant co-cducatlon,

Hurrah lot the frog thnt or m the bog

And solved for this great nation,

A question so vast in times now past,

And gnve us Gotcdumtion,
Together or there, or Foul or fair, in every kind of chIllcr,
Atwork or ploy, on ev'ry dny, we lmye good timcs together.
On (Cnnl: court we have ﬁne sport, when “love and love": the rally
On bike: we ride, out side by side, o'cr hill and plain: and valley.

Hurmh for the hog that sat in the hog

And solved for this great nation,

A qucstion so vast in times now post,

And gave to Corcducntlon

Here Come the Pioneers
The men oreld were strong and bold nnd full orenetgy,
They slatted out with song and shoot the country For to see.
o’er hill and plain, with might and mom, they wandered for and wide
And never feared, but pioneered,wlmtcvcr might betide.
C/Jﬂrm
Here come the Pioneers ofold Grinnelll
Everybody stands and cheers
When hc sees the Pioneers.
Big men, strong men, sous ofold Grinnell!
Ifyou wmt to ﬁght, Come along and right.
For we can ﬁght like 0, Boy! see the Pioneersl
one doy z hunth concclvcd t huneh that they would Itavcl toe,
J, B. Grinnell. the poets tell, their leader brave and true.
“We’ll start today for Iowa}! to build a college there,
A college that for knowledge shall remain without compete."
(Charm)
The Mississip’ without a slip they swam from shore to shore.
And then into the boundless vi:w diey ventured to explore
Until J, B. climbed up a tree the eounrry (or to scan,
And hustled down to build a town according to his plan,
(Clams)
They hnuyled some logs out from the bogs and built a shade or two)
And hired some profs and other torts to tenth them whnt to do
They dug a hole and on o pole Old Glory planted there,
And then the bell of old Grinncll began to split the sir
(Chaim)
We celebrate, perpetuate, nnd joyfully oeelaim
The Pioneers orother years who nlways played the game,
The noble bond who fought nnd planned in spite oreyerything,
And thntis why we yolhfy and that is why we sing
