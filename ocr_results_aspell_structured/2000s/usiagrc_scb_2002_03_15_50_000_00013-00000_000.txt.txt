The man curse lifted!

This week I have been pondering the #man prob-
lem, and I believe that I have found a solution. The
Vperson option seems so silly, since few people actu~
ally ever use the word person in daily speech, which is
whyI believe the concept has not caught on. Instead, '
I propose that we use the sufﬁx "oid," as in humanoid.
We can all easily say, ”I am a freshoid,” or ”I am an
upperclassoid." Concerned with the environment? Write
your local congressoid. Garbage wasn’t picked up? Those
damn garbageoids! And ﬁnally, since the word women
is simply an insulttofemales (Oops! Gender bias againl),
I think that we can all agree on the word womoids.
Phew, glad that’s solved. Now we can ﬁnally put the
”liberal" back into our liberal arts educations.

The English majal’s curse
Zourlds! I can no longer avoid Grinnellians refusing
to capitalize words. I thought Grinnell was a safe ha-
ven, as everyone here has at least a decent grasp on
basic English. However, with everyone on plans failing
to press the “Caps Lock’ key or hold down the “Shift"
key, and people writing in to die Random Rant without
a single capital letter, the English majol’s curse seems
unavoidable. I don’t think what I‘m requesting—that
people put as much effort into style as they do into
their ideas—is too selrsrighteous or anal. If you’re e.e.
Cummings or you write in ancient Greek, then it’s com—
pletely appropriate not to start sentences with capital
letters or capitalize ”I." At a college that proclaims it—
self ”upper-tier” and has, after all, a minority of people
who failed the third grade, I expect some consideration
for stylistic norms.

I am sleepy.

I am hungw.

Two copiers were out of order in Hurling today.

People in the computer lab are being loud.

I already asked nicely.
