that such an expatmnce puts you in

A: she describes in lhe film, Booth always felt that she had two
selves to cultivate her Iowa selfarnd her Jewish self In high school
she joined all the pep cluhs and student otganizations. Her pictute

“Iewishness” obliged her to attend civil rights demonstrations.
Jewishness to hot tepteseuted something orthe “datket, mote sati-
ous side of human nature." She otten felt isolated from the goyem
(Yiddish for non-Jew. literally “other") that were her peers. That
sentiment of feeling alone and dittetent has a long histoty and has
attected what Booth calls “out sense or peoplchood." it is in the
ptayets and the songs, like Ma»Oz T-eun “Who can tctcll the things
that betel] us?" it is in the evetyday vocahulaty or many Jews. tot
Booth, that vocahulaty also included the vocahulaty ofhlending, or
not dtawing attention to he. Jewishness.

1n the heginniug othet film, Booth says that she leatued at the

Excerpts from “Something About Myself”

By Fakil’ Iskander, Grinnell Russian Artist in Residence 2001

Now hete is an example rtom my own experience.

When 1 was at school the whole class was one day given the task
ottutning a patch otscaside wasteland into a place orcultuted test
and tecteatton. sttange though it mayseem, we actually succeeded,

We planted out the patch with eucalyptus seedlings, using the
clustet method, which was an advanced method tot those times.
Admittedly, when thetc wcte not many seedlings and too much
wasteland lert. we hegaii to putonly one seedling in each hole, thus
giving the new, ptogtessiue method and the old method the chance
to show theit woith in (me competition.

In a tew yeats a heautirul gtove or eucalyptus ttees gtcw up on
that wasteland and it was quite impossihle to tell whom the clustets
and whete the single seedlings had been. Then it was said that the
single seedlings, heing in ditcet ptosimity to the clustets and envy-
ing them with a thotoughly good sott oreiwy, had made an etrott
and caught up.

Be that as it may, when i come back to my hometown nowadays,
i sometimes take it easy in the shade orthose now enotmous nets
and feel like a sentimental pattiatch. Eucalyptus gtows vety fast, so
anyone who wants to feel like a sentimental pattiatch oin plant a
eucalyptus use and live to see its ctown toweting high ahoye him,
its leaves tinkling in the hteeze like the toys on a New Yeat net.

But that's not the point The point is that on that rataort day
