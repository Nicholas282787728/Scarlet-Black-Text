The Pioneers have had little trouble
defeating their opponents, putting“ up
three wins against {our schools in the
last week The softball team has had

trouble closing out, splitting two dou- ,

ebleheaders and ii back to brick series
of games during their last six games at
home.

After beating Clark College 4- 3 on
Tuesday, the Pioneers fell to Central 8*
4 later in the afternoon. The Pioneers
beat Luther 8 7' In their first matchup
on Thursday, bur lost a lopsided eon~
test in the afternoon, falling to Luther
14-0.

On Saturday, in a very important
Midwest Conference doublErdip with

llinois College, rhe Pioneers put up
a win taking down the Blueboy s 5- 3.
However the softball team had a yhenrt-
breaking loss later In the day falling 4 o
to the Blueboy s.

“I believe ytliat our team has been
unable ro win the second games of

our doublerheaders simply because we
lose focus,” said Madison Salander ’03.
“Once we have beaten a team, we know
we are capable of winning so we don’t

play with the same intensity for the'

second game."

The most damaging split for the
Pioneers was ligairisr conference roe, Ilr
linois College, with whom Giinnell' is
battling for a berth' in the conference
toui-.nament

“The split that we did not want
was with IC,” said Head Coach Tom
Sonuichson. “We need to learn to fin-
ish, The split has really put our backs

against the wall. We now need to win

out in conference and hope that some—

, one helps us by beating Monmouth

rare dawn but not out

The first game against lC was a
thriller. Grinnell’s Katie Bartlett '09s
homered twice on her way to a 3 to ’3

~ 3 game After trailing by one run early
into the guns, the Pioneers stormed?

back with a three- -run third‘ inni ‘
on a Bartlett solo homer and a two-

" RBI‘ triple off thebat of Darcy‘VVatsM‘

'09. lllinois College tied the game in
the fourth inning, but the Pioneers o
picked up single runs in the ﬁfth and
sixth innings to secure the wins

The second game slipped right ‘
out of the Pioneers' hands. Grinnell
had a 3—1 lead going into the bot-‘v
tom of the seventh inning an RBI ’
hits from Bartlett, Ward and Sandra 1
King ’08, but a three-hit inning and a ‘
Pioneer error quickly turned the tide, »
allowing 1C to plate three runs in the -
last inning and steal the win.

“Losing the Last game against 1C
in the bottom of the seventh' inning
was a difficult loss,” said Bartlett \

“However, there is still a possibility
to make it to the tournament. We are s
going to have to sweep Monmouth
and wait to see if any of the other
teams drop a grime and allow us to go ‘
to the tournament."

The upcoming road games arc»
_must-win games for Grinnell. The
Pioneers will need to sweep their
doubleheader against Monmouth if
they want it ehnnce to compete at this
year’s conference tournament.

"Everyone on rhe team knows the'
importance of the games this week-
end aguinst Monmouth, We have all
the tools to beat them," said Bartlett.
“Hopeﬁilly, with all the hard work and
practicing, we will come home from

“Monmouth with two big wins. ” 9“ *~

 

Baseball continues to struggle with
teamwork as end of season nears

ev Aauv RAPOPORT

Grinnell's baseball team has suffered from ones
man games throughout their season, relying on indi-
vidual players to carry the team, After one such game
in which Leo Martin ’06 shined on both offense and
defense, the team came together as a whole, splitting
the next two games with contributions from the en-
tire lineup

Martin pitched a complete game in the first game
of the weekend’s doubleheader with Luther College,
striking out 10 and only allowing one unearned run.
The Midwest Conference Pitcher of the Week also
drove in the Pioneers’ first run with an RBI double in
the third inning. .

“He just dominated the mound,” said Pat Lyons
’09.

The second game was more ofa team effort, Mars
tin set the tone with a solo home run in the first in-
ning, but it was nor enough to keep the Knights from
pulling aheadTruiling 876 in the bottom of the sixth
inning, the Pioneers rallied to take the lead.

More than halfofthe lineup chipped in during the
rally. Peter Leo '06 led offthe inning with a walk, ad
vanced on a single from James Bird ’08 and scored on
a base hit by Michael Rosenbaiim ’08. Robbie Unsell
'08 ilnd Andrew Colver '07 followed up with back»to»
back doubles. Kevin Byrne ’oo Chipped in later with a
two-out RBI double. When the dust settled, the Pior
necrs liad plated ﬁve runs offoffive hits and sent nine
batters to the plate.

“I felt like it was a pretty cooperative effort a
team win,"said Lyons.

Grinnell dropped Tuesday’s game 6-5 to the cor-
nell Rams as a result ofsevernl small mistakes.

“[Our] defense didn’t make every play we needed

to," Daniel Clark ‘07 said, “[and] we didn’t capitalize ,

with men on base,"
Rick Berdelle ’09 pitched two and onenthird strong

innings,giving up just two runs and striking out four.

But the bullpen could not hold the lead, and the Rams
plated two runs in the ninth inning off of Gary Kahn
’09 with one hit, three walks and il fielding error.

Despite rhe tough loss, Clark feels confident in
the team’s ability to finish out the season with some
wins. “There aren‘t any easy outs in our lineup," he
said.

The Pioneers will need to avoid the errors that
cost them the Cornell game in then upcoming schedr
tile, which includes Monmouth, lllinois College and
ii rematch with the RiliiiS. “You can't give teams like
lVIonnloutli and Illinois College any extra outs,” said
Clark.

Grinnell (5‘6 MWC, 13-13 oveinll) will host llv
linois College (375 MWC,15712 overall) in .1 double-
