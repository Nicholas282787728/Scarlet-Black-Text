Pub’service halted

BYJAI GARG

Lyle's Pub temporarily shut down Wednesday and
Thursday due to an oversight involving its Food License,

According to Dean of Students Travis Greene, Director
ofDining Services Dick Williams went to Lyle's on Tues-
day only to discover the food license had expired.

"It expired in January, but we just found out about it
now," Greene said. “The food inspector will be on campus
[on Friday,] so it willbe up and running on [Friday] night."

According to Greene, the oversight occurred because
the contact person for the license was former Associate
Dean of Students Sheree Andrews. After Andrews’ depar-
lure last semester, the responsibility of overseeing Lyle’s
was passed on to Greene.

“With all or the stafﬁng changes and she not being
here, I went through the mail addressed to her and could
not find it," Greene said “But what I did was change it so
that Loosehead RLC and Assistant Director of Residence
Life Kim HindseEtuslt is the person in charge as one of
the advisers."

Despite the situation being resolved quickly after
Greene drove the license application to Des Moines after
hearing the license was expired, Lyle's was forced to shut
down Wednesday and Thursday nights.

“What's really upsetting is that we had a ﬁrst-ever ka-
raoke night planned for Wednesday night, it took a couple
ofweeks for us to coordinate the date," said Lyle's Manager
Susan Klumpner '09. "On an average special event night we
make $250 in proﬁt, so that is a loss we cannot make hack."

Because of the closure, Lylc’s had to cut many workers'
hours this week.

“1 count on working two shifts a week. i do not have any
shifts this week," Klumpner said. “Five employees will not
be recording hours this week."

In addition to the loss on Wednesday and the cut hours,
the Pub also last approximately 5100 on Thursday night.

“It's not even about the money," l<lumpner said. ”Stu-
dents like Thursdays because of the atmosphere."

Lyle’s will reopen tonight at 8 p.m. and Klumpner en~
courages students to make their way to the JRC basement.

No Limits

and No Limits took nearly a month
to arise.

“With No Limits and SGA it was
a very good conversation," Bale said. “I feel like some
people restrained themselves on both sides because there
is a lot of disagreementrl think a lot orpeopie are sure
prised that No Limits didn't come to us first because
SGA is specifically supposed to represent student voices
to the administration."

Despite this being the first documented interaction
between SGA and No Limits, Morakc
said that she has met with members
of No Limits outside of their group
meetings. “I would like for [more in-
teraction] to happen," Morake said.
“We have met with them as students-
at~large btit not as a collective,”

No Limits member Mark Sullivan
’10 said the lack of contact with SGA
was partially intentional, as a rcsulr of
past involvement with SGA leading to
dead ends at times.

“I don’t think we will go to SGA
on all or our issues because, as prevls
ously stated, we want to work outside
the system," Sullivan said, “I think a lot of people in No
Limits think that working within the system—they're
very disenchanted with that and people in SGA are very
good at working in the system and I think they should
continue to do so. So we can use both."

In reaction to No Limits’ demands, an opposing
group No Shame was formed in order to foster a discus
sion of positive aspects of Grinnell College, No Shame
carauthor Anna Gilbert '09 said.

“A lot of the No Limits demands are very valid and
very important and I think that discussion should con-
tinue as it has," Gilbert said. “But I also think a key
aspect ot’any discussion with an administration is thank-
ing them for past successes and acknowledging that
when students ask for things at this school, almost 100
percent ofthe time they are listened to and a majority of
the time those things happen,"

Though demands have yet to be met by the admin-

surprised that No l

istrarion, No Shame has been perceived as a student
response to No Limits demands. “[No Shame] was
obviously a response, it wouldn’t have come out if the
demands hadn’t come out but I don't know that it was
meant to antagonize us as much as just ‘we disagree and
here's our perspective on it and 1 think that’s good," said
No Limits member Mary MacDonald '09. “People want
to know ifthis is not representative of the student body
and that's a conversation that needs to be happening.”

One of the most polarizing rumors in Circulation on

campus involves interactions between No
Limits and prospective students during
upcoming prospective student weekendsr
Members ofNo Limits have said they do
seek to approach prospective students in
the coming weeks, but have clariﬁed a par
sitiori different from the assumed nmagv
nistic intentions, Members of No Limits
are advertising in the form of chalked
sidewalks and wearing t-shirts encourag-
ing prospective students to inquire about
the project.

“We have this rhetoric of being green,
queer friendly, diverse place, and it doesn't
match up with what's actually happening
here and the fact that Grinnell is talking about it and
marketing itself that way is great, but that means that
hopefully that’s what the prospies want to be," Sullivan
said. “So we’re showing prospies that if they’re looking
at this place because of those reasons, you should come
here because you can help us ﬁx those reasons, rut those
things."

Members of the No Limits Project said the group
doesn't have any concrete future goals beyond the Con»
tinuation ofcurrent demandsr

“By saying that we have plans after that is kind of
like saying that we're anticipating the administration
not meeting our demands," Sullivan said. “We're going
to have to keep going next year and l think that I would
say that as along as the administration hasn’t met our
demands, there will be a no limits group."
