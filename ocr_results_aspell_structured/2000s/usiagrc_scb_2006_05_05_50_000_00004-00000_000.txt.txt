Bull fighters, bully fighters raise a few red flags

Good Night, and Good Luck
(PG)

Obviously a man with a mission, George Cloouey
Worked on two political films in 2005: Syrian/t and
Goat/Night, and Good Lurk on this highly politicized
campus, message movies like this are the candy to the
main course otn political science class.

As a candy, though, is GuadMgbl, and Gamble/1
any good? ls it more NECCO wafer or creme hrue
lee?

The story itself is a fairly interesting retelling of
the controversial actions real-Life editorial journalists
Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly took in face
of the growing power and fear generated from Joe
McCarthy’s anti-communist political machine dur
ing the 1950s. They, almost alone among mainstream
American media, dared to challenge McCarthy's ve-
racity and integrity.

worked into this broad plot are more personal
subplots showing the lives of those who work behind
the scenes on Murrow’s famous CBS television show.
These personal relationships and insights help to
make the film more than simply canned history

To capture the feel of the times, GandIVig/yl, and
Good Lurk is a black and white film, though actually
shot in color and desaturated in post-production. By
making a film about the 1950s in a visual style remir
niscent of ﬁlm from the 1950s, second-time director
George Clooney has managed to make his dry and
only somewhat passionate script rather cinematic.

Sure, the sleek black-and-white cinema created
with expensive technology cannot Ltuly match the
tone and texture ofgenuine black and white ﬁlm but
the effort is avaljant and, generally speaking, success
ﬁll one.

The cast is an absolute delight, and perhaps the
best ensemble of the year. Strathairn‘s Oscar nomi-
nated performance as Murrow well earned the honor.
A true character actor, he genuinely inhabits the char
acter ot Edward R. Murrow, who struggles to navigate
the two realms ofcelcbtity and journalism.

Perhaps the two most charming characters are Joe
and Shirley, two CBS employees who have to hide
their marriage from the higher-ups and peers, or risk
getting fired because eta noewedeemployees rule at
the station.

Patricia Clarkson and Robert Downey Jr. give
these characters lively and sexy zest. In their perfor-
mances, the film's depiction ofthe past feels as alive as
our present, and helps the ﬁlm break from dry historie
cal retelling and into the realm of genuine humanity.

Politically, Good Mg/rt, amt Goad Lat/t presents a
historical situation presumably analogous to our own,
though this message alone is not enough for a ﬁlm.
Thankfully, through a well-polished style and inter—
esting subplots, Clooney provides an entertaining and
thoughtepoking (not quite at the level ofprovoking)
night out at the movies.

George Gloomy and Daaid Stmﬂmim tale: mm: Irratfor tba/[erlgingjve McCarthy’s anti-Communir/poli‘tier.

Tire Matador is one of those difficult-t -classify
ﬁlms. It’s a dark comedy, it's a thriller, its abuddy
ﬂick. Writer and director Richard Shepard harnesses
the crosrgenre fusion to make a ﬁlm both funny and
interesting. *

The film focuses on the friendship between Ju»
lian (Pierce Brosnnn) and Danny (Greg Kinnenr), a
friendship which begins at a hotel bar in Mexico City
and is solidified when the two men attend a bullﬁght.
Their lives are changed forever when Julian reveals
his profession.

Like a matador, Julian kills with ruthless preci—
sion. Unlike a matador, Julian kills people. Both men
are in Mexico City on business: an important deal for
Danny and an assassination for Julian.

As it follows the characters out of Mexico City,
the film plays on the clashing qualities of the two
almost opposite men. Danny wears business clothes.
Julian wears unbuttoned shirts and gold necklaces.
Danny is happily married. Julian seeks out underage
prostitutes, Kinnear's Danny is somewhat dull, serv-
ing mostly as a comic foil for Julian.

Though Kinnear performs competently, it is Brose

nun who truly shines. Throughout the film, he cone
stantly presents his 007 image. However, in this ﬁlm
he takes the most characteristic traits ofJames Bond,
drinking and womanlzing, and makes them crass and
unappealing.

While the assassin and the secret agent are similar
professions, Brosnan‘s new character is convincingly
seedy crude and unreﬁned. Brosnan brings out these
qualities with delightful sincerity.

Yet under the rude, cocky surface, the assassin
hides an increasingly severe sense of paranoia that
is beginning to affect his career. Brosnan makes this
humorously obvious during a memorable scene at
a hotel pool. On his way to the pool, Julian walks
through the hotel lobby wearing only black boots and
a speedo. The aging, semienude body completes the
portrait ofJulian as the classic sketchy, middle-aged
man. He downs a drink, jumps in and then sees hal-
lucinations ofa ﬁerce shark with him in the pool. The
greasy playboy is pathetically crippled by fear.

Shepard's kecn direction keeps the film lively He
successfully puts an entertaining twist on familiar
ideas of friendship and redemption. More imporr
tantly, he allows Brosnan to steal the show. The Mata-
aor- is worth seeing for Brosnan’s performance alone.
