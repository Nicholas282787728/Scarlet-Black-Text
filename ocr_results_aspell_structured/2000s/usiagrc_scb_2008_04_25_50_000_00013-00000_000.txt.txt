appearance of Doughai'ty at Disco.

Neither administrator has been .
Grinnell a full year and Doughar-ty's only
been on campus fullttime for two weeks. Yet
in sucll a short time, both have made it clear
that they're not afraid of strident life, even at
its raunchicst, most bell-bottomed moments.

Life skills training in CDO

Colleges, in general, do a pretty good job

FM handles any scary technical inalnincc

have to fix our own software.

of presentations does wonders to quell some
of impending terror of graduation. While
tricks to writing resumes

helpful, trying to crack the

Insurance 101, gives us at least a glimpse in

The apocalypse is, in fact, not coming

Jim Malewitz ’09 asks us to see the good in the world and acknowledge our adaptations

these words at the Gillie)?

This opening request nray sound familiar.
If you attended Patch Adam’s afternoon talk
two weeks ago, you may recall hearing it early
on in hrs repertoire. Almost everyone preseirt
responded with raised hands, But I, along with
just a couple other students abstained from

you what motivated my seemingly untconscit

Mr, Adams may have seen my umrarsed

I feel comfortable with the wily society

some of the economic. political and social syst

serious problems caused by incredibly selfish
deeds. With problems such as climate change,

people like Patch Adams pessimisticilly projs
tct a loornrng apocalypse

In an address at Cornell College earlier
this year, Adams expressed the view that if

power in lieu of compassion and community.
humanity wrll become extinct by the end or
this century.

I doubt that there are many Giinnell stu-
dents who actually view humans as an ens
dangeied species.
But the idea that
so many people
here maybe “pro-
foundly concerncrl

me wonder if we
fail to give ourselves or society enough credit

For every major prob

people working tirelessly
to prevent, Solve or ease
their consequences. This
hits been the broad trend
for centuries.

As we learn more
about the world and the
etrects of our living on it,
our (call it selﬁsh) desire to continue living as
comfortably as possible acts as a motivator for
us to find ways to keep ourselves aﬂoat,

While our world history has been ﬁlled
with disease. pollution, greed and war, it has
also been jam-packed with innovative cures,

Problems such as continued violence in the

But can't we take heart in the fact that
smallpox has been completely eradicated from
