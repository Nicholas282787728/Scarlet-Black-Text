The caucus tutorial continues

Caucus, cant. from p. 10

yourtaxes, butit will mean you (an't legally vote in any other primanes,
and yourname and address will go on the state party's list orits members.

a: What about the general election in November?
A: You can legally reregister somewhere else for the big election. But
Don Smith, history, doesn't think that would be ethical.

D: Can 1 vote absentee at the caucus?

A: ND. The caucus is supposed to be more oia discussion than an election,
so only those present are allowed input. VDu can, however, be elected as
delegate to the county convention without showing up,

a: County convention? That sounds exciting.

A: It's on March 13, the Saturday that spnng break starts and the week
after the Democratic nomination will almost certainly be clinched, so it
may not be very exciting,

But each ward needs to elect a bunch of delegates e 28 in the college's
ward — so volunteers (and alternates, for the delegates who don't Show)
will be needed.

D: What role do the county delegates play7
A: A big one, actually. They’re the numbers on all the television screens
that night. Allthose percentages everyone sees represent the proportion
of county convention delegates across the state that are pledged to
support each presidential candidate

(1: Right So tell me huw the Democrats' candidate selection pmtess
works.

A; There are tour steps, hrst, everyone groups up with the other caucus-
goers who support the same presidential candidate, or with other

uncurnlrlitted caucusers. Thenr

0: hold on. Uncommitted (aucusers?
A: The people who haven't made up their minds yet. They runction just
like a candidate's group, and if there are enough or them they can send
delegates to the county, Just like a candidate's supporters. Those delegates
wait until March to make up their minds, perhaps with the advice or the
uncommitted caucusers who elected them back in Januany.

0: Okay. ED ahead.

A: So everyoneisin theirinitialgroups. Next, the caucus has to determine
which candidates are ~viable," To be viable in any given ward, a candidate
has to have 15 percent or the wards caucusers. So it Grinnell's 1st Ward
caucus draws and Democrats (a conservative estimate, Smith says), viable
candidates will need at least 75 supporters to achieve viability. The
same goes tor a group or uncommitted caucusers.

0: So if my candidate isn't viable, what can I do?

A: You can go home, or you can enter the third phase or the process.
After the ﬁrst viability count is ﬁnished, everybody's allowed to move
around again. You can leave a honsviahle group tor a viable one. Vou can
leave one viable group for another. You can even leave one group and
join a nunsviahle one, in order to make the second one viable.

Q: Suundx chaotic.

A; Smith says it’s like ”herding cats." Dnce everybody’s settled into new
groups, all or which have to be viable, the caucus orhcials will make a
hnal count Then they’ll plug the number or people in each group into a
rormula to determine how many orthe wards county delegate slots will
be awarded to each group. That's when you can volunteer to represent
your candidate in March.

in: So no matter how many people show up in the lst Ward, it'll only get
23 votes?

A: That’s nght. it's just a matter of proportions within each ward.
incidentally, Grinnell's 1st Ward caucus is likely to be one or the biggest
in the state, so even though it gem to send a few more delegates than
smaller wards, the caucusgoeis from most wards will have more voting
power than urinnellians will. That's the way it goes.

0: What about after the presidential candidate discussions are over?
A: Atter all that, the caucuses will discuss planks tor the county, state,
and national platiorms. irenough caucusgoers supportoroppose a plank,
you can send it on or chop it out.

D: so that's the Democratic caucus. But I'm a Republican. What will that
one be like?

A: That caucus should be a lot less interesting this year, since bush is
running unopposed. Dan Bunnell, a Republican leader in the lst Ward,
said he expects ad or so people and doesn't think there'll be much need
ror iormal rules. The presidential issue aside, though, Republicans will
still get to discuss their platrorms, Dunnell says he always tries to get
support tor a proschaice plank in the national cop platrorm. (He's never
gotten it quite all the way yet.)

0 Two of my roommates are Greens. Can they caucus?
A: Not unless theyioin other parties. Because no minor parties got more
than 2 percent or the statewide vote in 2002, the only oriicial parties in
Iowa this year are the Republicans and Democrats.
