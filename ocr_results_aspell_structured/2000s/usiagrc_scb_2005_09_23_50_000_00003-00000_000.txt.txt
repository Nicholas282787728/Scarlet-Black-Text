Going through Room Draw is or-
ten a trying process even at the best of
times, There are long waits, a dwins
dling selection of available rooms, and
a host of potential problems even after
the draw is done. But
for some students,
the problems go
much dccpcl. They
are forced to commit
to gender roles that
they don't share, and
reel deeply uncom-
{oi-table.

This is the die
lemma faced by
many transgendered
students, who often
do not feel comforts
able within current housing system,
one proposed for for that piohlein is
the idea of gender-neutral housingl At
its core, genderencuttal housing would
be a ﬂoor where students would not be
forced to identify themselves as male or
female. Last year, a resolution calling
for the establishment of genderenew
tral housing was passed by Joint Board.
The Housing Committee then created
a task force to develop and deliver a
proposition to the Board of Trustees
concerning this issue.

The issue or gender-neutral hous-
ing is relatively new to Griunell. some
other higher education institutions,

Gender-neutral housing nears trustee vote

Many students hope for a gender-neutral floor to help students who don’t feel comfortable
with traditional gender roles, but the proposal only allows gender-neutral roommate pairs

including Lewis and Clark, the Uni~
versiry ot‘Miehigan and Arizona state
have experimented with it. According
to Stephanie Masra, RLC rot Cowles,
Norris and Dibble (CND), one majoi
difference between Grinnell and other
institutions is bath»
room votes,

students to avoid
identifying with ei-
that gender, Batik

plicates the issue.
“If you are transgen-
dered, and the bathroom vote is single
sex, you are faced with a conundrum,
and that feels Like it’s an unsafe space
for you," said Masta.

Musta deﬁned gendereneutral home

feel that traditional roommate pairings
of biological males and biological fe-
males would provide them with sarety
and comfort ..." The gendereneutral
housing would be open to anyone who
identifies as gender—neutral, including
transgender students. One important
distinction, according to Masta, is that
gender-neutral housing does not mean
that housing will he coeducational hy

current housing system] forces people
to comply with a system or gcndcring
that they don't agree with," said Sarah
Lu '07. “When the school asks people
to do that, that is an example of the
school being an oppressor."

There was some initial resistance
when the resolution was initially pre
sented last year. According to Lit, who
was present at the debate concerning
the resolution, some senators quest
rioned the validity of the proposal be
fore voting in afﬁrmation.

“Although i am sympathetic to the
hardships that gender-neutral students
must coufront,1 think
that the unintended
consequence is that

them from the rest of
campus." said Justin
Abramson ‘08, who is
a senator from CND
and was also on Joint
Board last semester,

Despite questions
about the proposals
validity last year, Joint
Board passed it. This
year's student govern—
ment is also supporting it.

"It's part orour agenda this year, it
is something that we really wanted to
get accomplished,"said SGA President

portant, not only as a way of providing
for the transgender community, hut
that Grinncll as an institution makes
that statement in suppoit of that com,
munity."

Both Bohman and V'ceepresident
Chris Ochoa will be joining Jennifer
Krohn, Stephanie Masta and Sheree
Andrews in presenting the proposal to
the Board ofTrustees next week.

The hitiirc orgendersneutral hour
ing remains undecided'l'hough Bohme
an and the transrqueer communityhope
for a gender-neutral ﬂoor, the proposal
that will be presented to the Board of
Trustees will request that students who
identify themselves
as genderrneutral
be allowed to room
together. Abramson
supported the par
sition as a middle
ground that he
thought would keep
the genderrneutrai
community inte
grated with the stu-
dent body.

In the future,
both Bohman and

Masta said that gen,
der-neutral housing would not be only
for transgendered students, but students
who do not ascribe to gender roles at
all, as well as queer and ally residents
as well.
