S
and apathy

Someone should scold Student Services
Coordinator Drew Blackrnan for not read-
ing his SGA Constitution before the last
round of strident initiatives,

According to Article IV, Section C of
the SGA Constitution, for initiative Pm,
posals to reach the ballot, they must: 1)
be submitted in draft form to the Student
Services Co
o r d i n a t o r
(SSC) before a
speciﬁed time
and 2) have
100 signatures
of support by
a later date.
Last week,
Andres Chang
’05 submitted
an iniriative that met these requirements.
Upon receiving Chang's initiative, however,
SSC Blackman demanded that a number
of revisions be made. Some were excessin
ly petty, such as the request that all profan-
ity be removed,

Out of the litany of suggestions, only
one, if not conformed to, would warrant
the outright rejection of an initiative The
Constitution is clear on this poi All
recommendations are nonsbinding unless
absolutely necessary to fit the proposal inro
an actionable form."

Chang did make his initiative action:
able, though he did not meet all of Blacks
man's other requests. Rather than heed the
Constitution, Blackman chose to exclude
Chang’s initiative in order to “restore dig-
nity to [the student initiative] process."

It is clear that Chang’s “rant" lnltlnr
tive was not serious, and in fact, quite ri—
diculous. Nonetheless, SGA ofﬁcials are to
govern by the reason, spirit, and constraints
of the Constitution, nor the whims ofperr
sonal preference. For a student body that is
attempting to mobilize against apathy, this
action should not go unnoticed.

Moreover, if Blackman were truly cons
cerned about the dignity of the process,
he could have considered advertising the
initiatives In previous years, the SEC has

this year, per-
haps half of rhc
student body
would have voted. Instead, a muyority of
students did not vote, and all of the initia-
tives failed.

It would be inaccurate to pin the blame
for low student turnout entirelyon an SGA
ofﬁcial. If students want a stake in the de-
cision-making process, we have a respon-
sibility to at least get informed and vote.
Since that opportunity has now passed, we
should consider what we can do to make
the initiatives process more meaningful in
the futurelnvcsting time to draft initiatives
on pressing campus issues, campaigning for
their passage and demanding responsive—
11:55 when we they do pass would certainly
be a good start, Having SGA ofﬁcials who
encourage this process, rather than hamper
it, could go a long as well.

Time for a painful sacrifice on abortion

David Brooks is the kind ofwriterwho has

to be read on two levels. On the one haud,you_

have a conservative who deeply buys into the
myth that the essence of American liberalism
is on elirisr disregard tor the majority or the
country. This sounds ridiculous and offensive
to Grinnellian ears, though in ignoring it we
should be careful not to ignore its per-
vasiveness.

If, however, you filter out this
constant theme from his New York
Time: columns, Brooks occasion»
ally makes inreresring points. No
matter how much I may ultimately
disagree with his conclusions, I
often have to admit that he’s
made some very good points.
One example of that was in
his Apli121 column.

Brooks is n firm pro-
lifcr, and thinks that Roe cu.
Wade should be overturned.
His argument on April 21, however, was not
based on rhe “snncrity oflife." Rather, he said,
Rec 12. Wad: needs to be overturned bccausc ir
has contributed to the radicalizariou ofAmerr
ican politics.

The reason he was writing was in support
of Republican efforts to appoint staunchly
proclifc judges to federal courts by eliminating
the Senate filibuster. Consider the reason that
Republicans say they’re determined to elimi-
nate the ﬁlibuster: that practically no judicial
nominee has ever been filibustered,

That seems strange, from today’s point
ofview. After all, there have been embittered
minority parties in the Senate in the past. No
one ever thought to exercise their nurhoriry by

ﬁlibustcring judicial nominations?

Apparently nor, And while rhe exact sirUr
atlon we have today doesn’t have too many
historical parallels, consider the fervor with
which we consider judicial nominations. Every
single judicial nominee is the center ore huge
partisan fight, not because of how they might
rule in criminal cases, or economic cases, but

over their views on abortion.
Could there be a berrer way to do this?
I think it’s important that
. women are able to get
sate abortions, but rhe
current political climate
seems a bit ridicw
lous. Both sides are
firmly convinced
I“ that their position
is roots
ed in
funda-
mental human rights, and
both are liable to put enormous resources into

the abortion battle.

David Brooks' solution to the politi-
cal pitched bartlc over thc courrs was for rhc
Supreme Court to overturn Roe o. Wade and
return the matter to the states, where normal
legislative action on the state level would de-
rcrminc the legality ofabortlon access.

Idon’t like this, though I suspecr the results
will be better for pro—choicers than we dread.
Regardless, all rhnt does is transform one huge
federal problem in to fifty pesky smte problems.
It's better in that it removes some ofrhc ran—
cor at the federal level, but it also means some
states will have abortion outlawed,

We could also see a reversal:jlbm‘rllr fight—

Columnist classifies college

Sirring down ro write my S6519 column rhis
week,l feel a little unsculcd. Now
is the time when things like mugs
nolla trees and term papers are
blossoming, and attention span
and the winter wind have blown
on to distant peer institutions. It
is hard to spend time on a humor
column when it is the season to
he frolicking outdoors or syn-
[licsizing crirical sources.
After rcccnr cvcnrs afr
fearing the campus com,
munity, however, it seems
that humor is under closer surveillance than
a student surrounded wirh clever books, ninny
friends and springtime might think.
Although I have plenty of other rhings
to think about, this half of the semester has
forced me to consider what humor is good for,
and whar good humor is, Humor seems natu-

ral: shit happens,jokes happen. Do we need to
undcrsrund what everyone is laughing about?
Somewhere in academics, rhcy have a
point: there is a human condition, and some
times it is funny. Or like my mother always
says, you can’t please everyone. In the inter»
est of ideological differences, and because I
want to go to Dari Earn soon, I Will pro-
vide a sample of several rypcs of hue
mor that I as an individual student
observe around campus.

So while I’ll agree with David Brooks
about this problem, I reject his solution.That’s
wirhour even considering the polirical up-
heaval that it would take to get to the point
where Roe v. Wade could be overturned. Can
anything be done?

the mother at any time. on the other hand,
peopleilike meiwho believe that rhe right
ro have an abortion is essential would probably
need to accept severe limits on abortions later
in pregnancy, and probably also some form of
mandatory counseling.

1 don’t like these concessions. But I think
it’s possible to support women’s health and
freedom without requiring rhe country ro tear
itself apart. In a perfect world, abortion would
be, to borrow from Bill Clinton, safe,lcgal and

is poisoning the atmosphere in Washingron.
This empowers radicals on both sides, and
