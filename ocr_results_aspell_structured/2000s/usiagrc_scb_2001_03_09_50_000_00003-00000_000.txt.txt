The CoeneCola borrling company has agreed ro
allow blanrueker Necrars and Snapple produers to be
sold at the Forum Grill in spite ofGrinnell College’s
exclusive conrracrwirh rhe company

In a recenr memo ro student governmenr presi»
dent Sean Flammcr ’02, Dean of College Sen/ices
John Kalltbl-enner said he and Dining Services Di-
rector Dick \X’llliams had a “very constructive dis»
cussion" with a Coca—cola rcprcsenrarivc.

“They are very concerned abour rhcir Grinnell
customers and want to make sure that there are no ill
feelings about Coca-Cola,” Kallcbrcnnet wrote.
“They tilke grear pride in offering rheir produces and
srrive to have very posirive reianons wirh the come
puscs where rhey operarc."

Flammer said Wednesday that the sale of Nana
rucker Necmrs and Snapple had never nerualiy been
prohibircd by Gtinnell's eonrraer. bur had been rem.
porariiy disconrinued due re a miscommnicarion.

Members of Grinnelllans for Choice, a student
group organized ro rcsrsr thesewznryear eonrracr, were
told that Coca-Col: representatives would "most
likely nor have come" hurl the rendecvons been open
to students,

Despire whar seems like a vicrory for Coca<Colis
vocal opponenrs, there is evidence rhar the mo -week-

old boycott is running our of sream The erudcnrs
who set up shop in rhe Forum Grill during lunch
hour lasr week selling non coke beverages or cost,
were not there this week. And sales of Coca»Cola
prodilcs don’t seem to have been affected at all.

According to Kandy Wilson, who run: Northern
Express, caffeinared soft drink sales have risen slighriy
due to n-lidcer-ns, but beverage sales overall have re-
mained steady

“l have nor noriccd any difference in mysales ar
all," said Mary Kirk, manager or the Forum Grill.
She added rhar many erudenrs who were inirially upser
by the changes rried the new produers and realized
rhey liked rhem iusr as much,

“Since I broughuhe Nantucket [Nectal-s] back, I
haven't seen any dccrease in Minute Maid apple juice
or orange juice,” Kirk said.

Discussion or a Wednesday meering of
Grinnclllans for Choice focused on flagging turnout
ro group gatherings and obsracles in communrcnring
their beliefs to the campus at large

Members of rhe group also discussed rherr ntr
remprs ro call for an emergency referendum which
would maltc the boycott an “official" one.

Page 106 ofrhesrudenr handbook describes “pro.
cedures for boycorrs and fists," An SGA—sponsored
referendum could declare a set of dining hall foods
under boycott, which would not remove the food:
from rhe halls bur would require rhe college to label
rhem as boyeorred and provide alrernarives.

Grinnelllans for Choice members had previe
ously rhoughr such a referendum would require
only 20 percenr of srudenrs on board voring ro
boycott. Jen Krohn, dean of residence life, how-
ever, said she inrerprercd rhe handbook as requir-
ing a simple maioriry ofsrudenrs on board for rhe
college ro label foods, and 20 pereenr for rhe col-
lege ro provide alrernarives.

organizers of the group say rhcy will eonrinue
their efforrs ro persuade rho college ro reconsider rhe
conrracr.

“Ifwc’d stuck to following the rules, we wouldn’t
have gotten rhe very meager concession rhar we gor
today," said Paul Chaikin '01. “I think the adminis«
tration understand; something -[l’|a[ students don’t:
causes have predierabie pulses."
