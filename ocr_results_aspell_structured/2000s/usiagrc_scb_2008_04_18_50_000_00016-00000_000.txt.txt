Listen here, Listen Hear‘

3:22 AM: We just sat down to listen to “12
hours in Cleveland Lounge" fondly recalling our
long night of synthesis and YouTube because ree
ally there nothing better then Kohayashi vs. a griz~
zly hear (except for nuyhe someone blowing, up a
balloon until it pops). We were looking forward
to hearing "The Ben Hur of KDIC News Broadr
casting” but unfortunately what we heard was our
lounge essentiallzed, our words misused and our
nicotine diaspora portrayed as smelly, disgust
ing, drug addicts, unel we took olrense. Much of
the piece was funny, but boundaries were pushed.
There are things that go on in Cleveland that can
he sensarionalized, but they go on everywhere else
on campus as well.Wc feel exploited, made an ex-
llrnplc of and incriminated by those we welcomed
into our smoky home Please desist.
