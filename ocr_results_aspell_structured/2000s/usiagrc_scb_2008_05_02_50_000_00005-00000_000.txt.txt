Website redesign underway

BY PETER HENRY

As technology and Internet usage have be-
come more intertwined with everyday lrfc at
Grinnell, students have become increasingly
vocal about the shortcomings of the college's
website. The complaints have ranged from
gripes about poor usability to simply “visually
otfensive."1t’s no secret that many students are
frustrated with the Grinnell wehpage.

In hopes otsddressiug student complaints
with the website, the members of the college
community recently formed the Website Re
design Committee and Content Management
System (CMS) Committee. The committees
will gather information about how users view
the website and propose changes to improve
it.

Though students have long been lobbying
for a website renovation, committee members
said they are optimistic about recent progress.
“I think this is the ﬁrst time that we have the
ear of some parts of the administration," said
committee member Dylan Sather '10.

The Website Redesign Committee is a
strictly student group that gathers information
on how students use the website and how they
believe it could be improved.

The committee’s most recent and visible
effort has been posting a survey on Pioncer‘
web which was developed to gauge how stur
dents use the website and to collect opinions
on how it could be changed.

Committee member Mark Root-Wiley ’09
said he felt the survey was an important way

to demonstrate the seriousness ofthe strident
body. “People in the past have felt like they
have not been listened to," he said. “\Vc hope
that with this survey we can show that this
is happening and that people care, and that
things are going to get done this time."

While some of the changes Sathei and
Root—Wiley have in mind will take some time
to implement, they believe that the commit-
tee con make changes to the navigational links
and contcnt on the front page by the end or
the year.

The college’s Online Media and Web C07
ordinator Leonya Ivanov (“The website Guy,"
as the student survey refers to him) said he is
glad to have the input of the student group,
but emphasized that student input is only one
part of the equation. “Pickincss is useful. it’s
just that only 5 percent of the work is know
ing [what students think about the site]," said
Ivanov.

He said that while student input is impor-
tant, the process must consider all the different
purposes and users the website serves. “stur
dents are very important, but are only one of
the groups of constituents," he said. “Parents
have different levels of expectation in their ex—
perience, academic professors have a dieterent
level, and we have to keep all ofthem in mind."
Ivanov estimated that students make up less
than 20 percent of the website's trafﬁc.

What do you think :ur:
some hindrances in the
workplace?

The workshop I did today is about con—
versanons m the workplace. It is a very human
thing to complain and it is a very human thing
to gossip. Both of those conversations really
damage the workplace environment help—
ing people rcalizc the power of conversa-
tion, how you can have more positive ways of
speaking and be able to Create something that
will give energy and momentum versus getting
in the way ofa workplace, being able to bring
humor and fun into the workplace, makes peo
plc more etrcctive.

What’s the difference be-
tween a laughter yoga teacher
and a yoga teacher?

Laughter yoga actually
started in India. The idea is
snnply people getting together
and laughing without using jokes, humor, or
comedy. The reason we call it laughter yoga
it because we combine laughter cxerciscs and
yoga breathing, Pl‘imﬂyalrm. So, laughter we
etciscs combined with yoga breathing equals
laughter yoga, A lot of people think of yoga
and think ahont the poses but really it Is about
the brcatltingiit really is the centerpiece of

in valved

[What] I ﬁnd [is] laughter
IS naluml and so (onlagi‘avs
mill almosl everyone Will gel

yoga.

Do you run into people who have a hesir
ration to your methods?

Everyone arrives with some level of inhir
bition, what I find is laughter is natural and
so contagious that almost everyone wrll get
involved. occasionally, I will get someone
who wrll told their arms and not participate
but largtlv peoplc are m1 tell everyone that

everything is voluntary, it
often makes people feel
comfortable and [that they]
choose that they're in rather
than feeling like their being
forced to do something and
then won't.

What did you do at your
time in Grinncll?
When I was at Grinnell,
I was interested in sports
psychology and that was
foster-ed partly through be
ing a soccer player with John
Pﬁtsch. There were some courses here that
they were developing in sports psychology that
he and Will Freeman did. So I already had
some interest In that. There was no physical
education major, and 1 was interested in phi-
losophy, so 1 did that while taking a lot otedu-
cation courses. I wanted to be a teacher so I
got the elementary education certiﬁcate. But
then i decided that I did not want to be an
elementary teacher, instead I wanted to study
sports psychology.

The one message I would
like to share with Grinnell
students having been here
and looking back after 20
years is: to remind yourselves
and what a great opportunity
Grmnell is and how fun it
is to be hcrc. Sornctuncs It
looks like its hard but compared to most ofthc
stresses that most or the people in the world
are dealing wrth, we are lucky to have the prob
lems we have. I think ifwc remind ourselves of
that we can appreciate the time we have here
more.
