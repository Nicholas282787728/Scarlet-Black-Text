Mayﬂower Chaplain John sasrron waired ar rhe door of rho
Carmen Center on die second ﬂoor ofth: Mayﬂower Home waiting
for the arrival oflS Grinnellstudents. Also waitingwere three women.
residenu of ti]: Mayflower. As soon as the students arrived, daey bee
gan ro spread several plastic rarps in areas rhroughour the room. one
of the srudenrs explained rhar when rhey came rhe previous weds,
they'd made a mess with daeir charcoal dust.

After a few minures ofsmall ralk and rarp spreading, rhe rhree
women dispersed to diiterenr arm ofthe room, each accompanied
by three or four smdenu. Each woman sat in a chair in front of a
cluster ofstudents. Saxton went to hunt down some male residents
of the Mayﬂower who had volunteered to model hilt hadn’t shown
up. Soon the most ofthe chatter oeased and the room was filled only
with rhe sotr scraping of pencils and ehareoal on paper.

The srudone comprised Art 234, a drawing class raughr by Will
Pergl. Pergl explained that the original plan was to have a resident of
the Mayﬂower come ro campus to model for rhe drawing class. But
rhe more hediseussed it with Saxton, the more rhey rhoughr ir would
benefit the residents, particularly the less mobile ones, to hold the
drawing sessions at rhe Mayﬂower.

The purpose ofsurh a drawing exercise ended up being twofold.
First, it was obviously a chance for (h: studcnts to draw a different
kind of modci. While some found that drawing these models was
harder than drawing previous subjects, some round rhar the many
lines and wrinkles of the models’ faces actually made the drawing
easier “we’ve iusr been sining in the srudio drawing young. arhlene,
naked men . . . This is completely different,” one student said.

The orher purpose was ro give rhe residenrs and srudenrs a chance
ro inreraer, to “pus things in perspeeriye," Pergl Said, “Some srudenrs
were initially nor rhar excited at all abour drawing Mayﬂower ms]—
denrs but rheir experience ehanged rhe way rhey thought abour ir
afterward,"

Ruslan Trnsewyeh ‘03, who’d never been to the Mayﬂower he-
tore. enioyed simply interacting with rhe residcne. “I love it," he
said. “I just want to sit here and chat." Interaction with the models
arruaily helped the drawing proooss tor some srudenrs. “It’s better
[rhis way]," scan Murphy ‘03 said. “It's worse drawing someone who's
just . . . an oisyoer."

The residenrs were happy ro be parr ofthe aeriviry. “Ir's . . . ton
to do somerhmg with rhe eollege erudenrs, When they have a need
for us, it's fun to be able ro [hclp1." Mayflower residenr Amy Kroll
said. Model Eiiubeti‘l Ernst found it dilfitult to hold a pose. “It's
hard for me. I don’t think my mother would say I’ve ever sat still for
a full halfehour." The models did have some compensation, though.
"I like to see how intense tile young people ger while they're working.
And all rhe different positions rhey sit in," Kroll said. “lt's run to
watch them "

The models rook rhdr rasksenously. When anyone approaehod
them. the women seemed reluctant to talk or turn their hcads for
rear ordisrurbing rhe srudenrs’ drawing

Once they began to ralk, rhongh, the reridenrs were happy ro
share their impressions orrhe process rhey saw unioldmg before rhem.
One model, Jane Hatﬁeld, commented on how interesting she found
it to “see oneself as others see one " They were also intrigued at the
different processes and mediums the students used. While most started
with whire paper, some srarred with blaek paper, and orhers smudged
dre charcoal over the paper to ereare a gray background. one orrho
students explained that this enabled her to add or subtract from tlic
drawing.

warehing arr being created all around them pronrprcd some of
the models to think about their own involvement in the arts, “1 al-
ways thought ofmyselfas being in motion. ] love to act." said Hatﬁeld.
“I never sar still." Model Corinne Swltur enrerramed rhe group by

playing the baby grand piano rim or on the small, elevared srage ot
rhe auditorium. She reminissod about her morhrr who used to play
rhe organ aeeompanimenr ro silenr movies Kroll ralked about the
three attlsn in her family, who were enher phorographers or scuip»
rors. “I know they've all done this kind of dring and I’m just curious
to see . . . one phase ofit."

As rhe drawings were completed, many otrhearriseshowed rhor
work ro rhe residenrs. The feedback from rhe models rhemselves var
ied.

“I’m glad I’m nor a schoolreaeher, I'm afraid I'd dare somebody."

“I look like a reenager"

“Frrrzy hair s that’s cure."

“I feel like I’m old. . . it’s all rhe dark colors.”

Louise Brigugiil ’04 said rhar one of her subieers from the previr
ous week had some prerry poinred enriques “You made me look too
widel I don't like that, She’s sneaky—she's making me look roo wide,”
Briguglil quoted her model as saying Despite some occasional nega.
rive comments, many students agreed that it was good to ger teed.
back “They can be very helpful. A lot of times you get so wrapped
up in the drawing. rr’s hard ro step back They’ve lived wirh their
tacos tor many years and they know whar rhey look like," said Leah
B '04.

WCurrently, the series of drawings ereared ar rhe Mayﬂower aren't
planned ro be parr otany exhibit. Petgl intended rhem mostly as an
exercise tor rhe srudenrs and a course experiment. He srrdsed rhe
importance ofaJlowing students to work in rheir own sryle, or their
own pare. “He really ion you ﬁnd rhe way you work and work that
way," Brigugiil said. porgl explained that he felt it was .mporranr for
rhe srudenrs ro be able to oudine a goal and ro work toward ir indce
pendenrly, as artists do.

As the drawing session ﬂnrshed, many srudenrs rhanked rheir
models. Among rhe rosidonrs. several said that it had been a new
experience for them, and that .r was an enjoyable one. As rhe stu-
dents lerr the building. one orrhe Mayﬂower employees rommenred
rhar she'd ralked ro one of the residenrs, who’d said rhar she'd hadn'r
been in a good mood when she gor to the Carmen Center, bur that
rhe drawing session had made her day,
