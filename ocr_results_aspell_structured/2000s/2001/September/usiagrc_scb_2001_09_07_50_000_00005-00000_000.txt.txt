Happy new year

A guide on how not to spoil the

new shipment of fresh meat

Hi. Welcome in my column. It's called “Au Fair,"
which, as I menrioned lasr year, means soineehing in
French. I rook French for rwo years in high school, and
all I can do roday is to ask ro go ro my locker. I don't
even have a locker. The purpose of elris column, ifeliere
is one, is ro keep rhe campus informed of my bioed,
under—researched and rlierefoie often wrong rake on
campus life, evenes and polirics. That's all.

Well, us a brand ncwsemcsrer here as crinneli. and
as far as I can sell, aeide from my slightly berrer living
coiidiriom and my sliglrrlywoise anirude rowaids lcaui»
ing, everyrhing is iusr as I Iefr ie. The I=oruin Lady sriII
remembered ro give me a free cookie wirh my sand.
wich, rhe guy who picks his nose once again signed up
forali ofmy classes, and despire ienovarions Cleveland
lounge sriIl smells a bir like dearh. dying. and Cheeros.

Ofcoui-se, I can'r help bur noriee wirh sadness rhar
anorhei nuairer ofrlie school has moved on ro die in
employed phase ofrheir life and in rheir place is a new
gioup ofsrudenrs. Some people complain eIiar rhe ﬁrst
years aie a nuisance, a eonscinr reminder of ehe evere
changing face ofcrinneil They rhiiik rliar me newest
barelr ofcrinneliiam are boring, preppy, and dumb

AIrhoiigI l have no conclusive dara ehar supporn
or conrradiers rhese claims, I believe rhaeweshould push
forward, keepingin mindrlrarrhelaeseihingabourliav.
mg 400 new people on campus: rhai rhey have no idea

_ who you are. Thar means rhar [here are 400 people
around that have no idea wliar a lousy lab partner you
are, 400 people who didn'r see you rhrow up adI over
ihar chick’s plarforin shoes ar Disco; 400 people who
never saw you cry during ehae problem on your Cale 11
final rhae involved finding the volume ofa donur. And,
mosr impoiraiirly, rhere are 400 new people here who
will never sispeei ehar when you were a firsr.year you
were iusr as boring and dumb as you rhink rhey are.
Don't rhink you were boring and dumb your ﬁrst year
here7 Take a look ar your old sriidenr ID picruie for a
window ineo your deep, dark, boring pasr, Look ar rhar
haircuri Think abour rhe ﬁrst parry rhas you arrended.
Remember having rlre finer poinrs ofa keg pump ex-
pIained ro you you uninformed empry headed Hum?

In shore, rliese people have no idea who you are.
making ir rhar much easier for you to gee in bed wirh
rhem or ar lease ger rhem ro liseen ro your inane srory
abour rhar time you seole some guys paiirs rlrar all of
rhe upperclassmen have eirher heard abourorwirnessed.
Take advanrage.I As far as ehose pooi-ignoranrsoiils know.
you inighr have an ok personaliry.

And remember move quickly. Ifyou so much as
pause ro choosewhich ﬁrspycar to hit on, he or she will
have already gained rheir fieshrnan Is and losr rliar iii.
noeenr sparkle iii rheir eye. Give a firseyear a few weeks
at Grinnell and a new haiicur and before you know ir
eliey me much roo cool to dare ehe likes ofyou. Or even
worse—rhey mighe have heard abour rhar riine you
spilled your eiirire dinner rray in Quad during N30
and everybody clapped.
