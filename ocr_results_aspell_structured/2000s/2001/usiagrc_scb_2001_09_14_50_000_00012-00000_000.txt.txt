Changes to the rules of collegiate women‘s volleyball implement a new system of scoring. get poor reviews from Pioneers

When the Plontcn’ faced Marycrcst lnremarionnl
University in Grinnell's first home game afrlic season
Sepr, 4, someriiing seemed vaguely wrong in Darby
Gymnasium.

As usual, both teams were on the ﬂoor, fans lined
the stands and Grinncll even came away with a wilt,
bur a murmuring in riie bleachers pointed ro a sense of
eoniusion. As rhe display on riie scoreboard slowly
marched from oeo to 15—13 to 25—23, more and more
observers looked up and srarred aslcing, “\Whar’s going
on here?"

The confusion in Darby is a seene rhar has been
repeared rhrougbour rhe country as rhe 2001 volleyball
season has opcntds Lasr February, rhe National Asso-
ciation for Girls and Women in sporr, rhe organization
whose rules are used by rhe
NCAA to govern volleyball,
passed several changes ro rhe rules
of volleyball riiar fundamentally
alrered how the sporr is played.
As a member ofNCAA-Division
III, Grinnell has played under
rhcse rulessinee irs season opener
sepr. l.

The most noticeable of rho
ruie ehanges, and rhe one rhar
caused rhe ouesrrons abour rhe
Darby scoreboard, is rhe insriru.
rion or rzlly seoring. Under riie
old rules, only reams thar served
rh: ball could score a palm; the
receiving rearn could only earn the righr ro serve wirii a
side our. Rally scoring, rlrough, shanges rhar. Now, ci-
rher ream can earn a poinr on every serve, and games
are played to 30 poinrs rarher rhan ro rhe rradirional
15. As orlasr year, only women's volleyball still played
wirh sldcroutscoring; rnen's volleyball and internarionai
volleyball eomperirions have used rally scoring rorycars

The scoring changes have nor been well received by
eirher players or eoaehes or Grinnell.

“1 have been an opponent otrally scoring cvcr sinee
it was First conceived," head volleyball coach Tom
Sonnichsm said.

Pioneer players agreed rvirh riioir coach. Oursrde
hirtci'Mnrlah Hibai‘ger ’05 ﬂlldsctmrstephanlc Schmidt
'03, who have played under both the old and new the
new seoring sysrern, borli said riiey did iior like the
ehangc, Reasons tor rhe disdain varied, rliouglir

“I don’r lll<C ir because ir piss a reani against list-if,"
Schmidt said “A team Could lose a game for irschby ll“
the errors it makes,"

"1 was really upset about
the change.1t’s really hard
being told you'll have to
make a complete adjust-
ment to how you play your
game halfway through your
college career. "

—Mariah Hibarger '03

“I was really upser abour rhe ehangex‘ Hibarger said.
“lr’s really irard being told you’ll have re noise a com.
plcrc adrusrinenr ro how you play your game halrway
riiroiigh your college career."

Soniiirhsen had a nuinbcr orrcnsons ioi opposing
rlir elrangc. Among rhern, he said is die unfair ad ii.
ergo it gives to die ollrenrive portion or rhe game by
allowing a poinr ro beseored on every serve.

“its eounrerprodurrive," Sonnieh, i said. “The rea.
son irhe old sysrerni was in plaee is beernse orreiisive
volleyball is always srronger. r-nore domiiianr, riian dc-
ferisivr volleyball."

Sonnielisrn said riiar pasr rules shanges, such as
moving the oirr of bounds antennas in on rhe nor to
decrease rhe ainounr orroorn hirrers have ro wort with,
have been arrernprs to give the team playing defense a
berrer chance. Raliyscoring, he said, works againsr rhorc
changes.

“Now, rhe dornriranr reams
are going to win probably 75 re
80 percent or rhe marshes rliey
are going to play, beeause rhey
happen to be srronger,”
Sonnichsen said,

Another reason sonnicbsen
said he is opposed ro rhe change
is because orirs misapplimtion ro
women's volleyball

Rally scoring was originally
eoneeived as a way ro speed up
men's volleyball marches. Because
oirhehigii level orpower in men’s
volleyball, riie defense has very
lirrie eonrioi orrhe bdi and marshes undersideoiir scor-
ing could drag on For upwards oirour hours.

“\Vomen, on the orher hand, have always been able
ro irecp rip defensively," Sonnichscii said. “so we take a
produer riiar already works. which is already entertains
rag. and we ehange ir ro be like men Thar irrsr doesnt
nialsc sense."

sonniehsen said anorher goal or. ally scoring was re
srandardiee rhe lengrh or games, inalring ir color for
matches re be releviscd. since only a sclecr few Division
I schools are releviscd, rhougli, Sonnicliscn said riiar rlre
move so rallyseoring is unnecessary.

“To make everybody. rhousarids and thousands of
young ladies, play by a searing sysrcrn that's going to
hopetirllyenlirnec maybe 200 lods is illogical," he said.

Rally scoring his not only elicrred strong opinions
on rhe Pioneer ream, ir has also changed rhe way rhe
team is playing Beeause rho iiew scoring system awards
one train a poinr ior anorlier reain's error, players and
coaches said there is no longer any room for error

"Every bad scrvc, every had hit, every pass rhar you
send our orborrnds is going to result in a point to. rhe
oriier ream," sclimidr said. “were definitely more con»
scioos abour riiisrilres.”

“players riglir now are srill playing renrariveiy wirh
ir," Hibargei added.

Soniiieliscii agreed riiar rlicre is no longer any room
ior reanis ro make niisrilees, “There is no ioonr forerror
or all," he said. “Players have got ro be executing per
reerly, because when yoir make in error, ir eosrs you a
point.”

Sonniclisen added this awarding poinrs for a reruns
crror makes lirrle sense.

“To couare rlus ro orliersporrs, in bashcrball, ifyou
shoor rlre ball and you doii'r make a polar, the orhcr
rearri doesn't inaire rwo poinrs because you made an er
ror," he said. “It nor doasni rnaire airy sense."

Also, because poinrs can accumulate so guieldy unr
der nrlly scoring, reams rhar could onee eorne baeit from
a rive—poinr dorreir have now all bur losr rh'e game when
down riiar tar.

“The comeback, which is a huge. huge parr ofirae
dirronal scoring, doesnt happen anymore." sonniehsen
said “It reminds meorriiesheep rbarare in the back or
rhe slaughrerline, The closer rhey ger, rhey can see whar's
happening up ahead, but rhcy have re keep marehing
reward ir," .

Tradirionaliy, Grinnell has been a ream rhar has dee
pended on rhe eornebaeie, so ream members said rhey
have had ro eharige rheir arrirudes rowaid how rhe game
is played.

“Considering rhar we've always been a eomebaele
ream, we need ro learn how ro ger ﬁred up or the begins
ning ofthe game." Hibargersaid,

The teen. has relr orher psychological effects ofrhe
new scoring sysrern, roo.

“There’s a grower sense oirirgency wirh every single
poinr," Hibaiger serd.

“This year, the polars riiar rnarrer inosr are no longer
13 KC 15, (hey MC between 18 and 20, because once you
ger in n lull it's really, iealiy bard to gcr back," schnridr
said.

Tlrecliangrs rhar rhe new sroring sysrerri has brought
wirh ir do not bode well fol the sport, according to
sonnrehseii

“I rhrrih riiar ir's going ro leave a sorir rasrc wirli
the tan." sonriiohsen said, “I think were going ro
losc Fans

“1 think in probably rhroc or foul yeais it will go
baels ro sideorrr searing," Sonriielisen added, “bur in
rhc rrieanrime we will lose one or nvo generations of
eollegiare players, and we will nor aeconiplisli any of
[the new systems] purporred goals,"

The National Association
for Girls and Women in
Sport, whose rules or
volleyball the NCAA uses
to govern all three
divisions or women's
volleyball, made several
rhanges to how the game
is played, ihese new rules
took effect for the hrst
line or the beginning of
this season. Eelow are the
maior changes.

- ihe rally scoring rule.
Under the old scoring
system, only the team
that was sewing the ball
could score a point. If a
team was not serving,
they tried to kill the ball
to get a side out and the
thence to serve. All games
were played to 15 points.
Under rally Scoring, a
team can store a point
even if they are not
serving, thus side ours no
longer exist lire last resin
to some a point servesr
Games are now played to
so points. NAGWS also
sets the rules of high
school volleyball, but
those to keep sidEroul
scoring ior that game.

. The let serve rule.
Previously, serves that hit
the net but still went over
weie not legal. Now,
serves that do this are
allowed and stay in play

- lire one toss rule
Servers are now allowed
only one loss pei serve.
Before this rule, sewers
could re-toss ii they were
not happy with their
original toss.
