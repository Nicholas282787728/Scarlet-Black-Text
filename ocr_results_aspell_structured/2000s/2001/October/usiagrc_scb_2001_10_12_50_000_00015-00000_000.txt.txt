Staff Writer

Ten years ago, ienny Wood '92 was one ofrhe
stars of Grinnell College’s soccer and basketball
teams. Now she’s a star ofa different kind, as one
of the only women in collegiate sports to coach
niens soccer.

As a student. Wood was r sweeper for the
women‘s soccer tcam. Athletic diiector Dee
Fairehild remembers her as
a very strong player. “You
knew if the hall got down
there. she wasn’t going to let
it gas in the goal," Fairchild
said. adding that even as a
student, Wood ohviously
knew the game very well.

Wood also knew the
value of haiaircing sports
with school. and that under
standing affects her mocha
iiig today. “She played with
an intensity, took hcrzttl‘iiete
ics seriously. and enjoyed
athletics very much."
Fairehild said. “and gota lot
out ofher eduation, too. ..
one ofrhe pluses ahout he.
ing a Grinnell grad is met
you understand the stresses
of academics."

After graduating from Crtnneli with a major
in political science, Wood went to St. Michael’s
College near Burlington. Vt.. where she coached
women's basketball and eventually earned her
Masters degree. Being from Des Moines. she said
she knew she wanted to return to lowa eventually,
but had no idea she would end up landing a posit
tion at her aim: mater.

“In the coaching field. you have to he open to
going pretty much anywhere in the country where
you can get a position." Wood said. Getting a job

“I get two very different ex-
periences, in terms of what
men prefer and what women
prefer in learning style and
in leadership style, and I
enjoy both ofthem. The men
prefer technical feedback.
They want to know how to
ﬁx things. Women tend to
value the relationship side
of the leadership role more."

Wood started out in 1995 as roach of the
women's soccer and hoskerhali renrns. Then. in
1997, men's soeeer ersaeh iohn Pfitsch retired and
Woodsrepped in to rake his plate.

“He'r pretty much n legend hcie," said Wood.
“He coached for about so years. . , Him teing so

with soecer, I’d alwnys
played with the boys," she
recalled. “I grew up with

always coached me."

Being a Grinnell alumna gives Wood a distinct
advantage in understanding her players and die cul-
ture they live in, “i really value the Feedback and
the tommunicatioii" between players and coach.
she said. “Communication is the foundation thatl
build my programs on."

Men’s soccer team captain Adzm Noyce ’02
credits Wood with giving her students the freedom

to develop as

players. out also keeping
her goals for the rcnm in
sharp focus.

“She's really intense. she
knows what she’s doing. .tnd she doesn‘t lead us
army." he said, “She takes her job very seriously.
She meticulously plans every practice. She knows
what we need to work on "

Fairchild agreed, and commented that Wood
is also constantly improving her own knowledge of
the garnet she coaches, to her toims' henent. “I think
she is very organized, and knows exacrly what she
wants to do in practice. [but] she's open to suggest
trons . . . she’s also constantly going to workshops
and stuff, and updating the latest strategies for hoth
hmkethall and sorter,"

The mcns soeeer team, which lost more than
halroritsstarting lineup to graduation lastyear, is
currently 2.5.1 “We are young and learning to
become consistent." Wood said. “Overall. I think
we're doing pretty well,"

The best measure ofa coach's efrerriveness may
not he statistics in a newspaper sideiaar. out rather
what kind ofeifect she has on her players. Wood,
who led the women's soccer team to the confer.
ence title in 1996, has an exemplary teeotdon both
counts.

“She put me in the middle ofrhe field," Noyce
recalled. “I'd never plzyed there before, and she
taught me a whole new position I’ve grown as a
player under her watch."

Wood said she enioys coaching the kind ofplaye
ers who are attracted to a small. academieally rige
orous sehool. “i really think that this is the hesr of
horh worlds.” she said. “i get to work with student
athletes who are very much motivated to learn, and
very much motivated to play their sports because
they love the game."
