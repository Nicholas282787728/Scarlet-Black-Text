After an evening or tun, what sounds more
appealing than heading to Bob's for a nice cup of
coffee and conversation with friends? Correct,
nothing.

of course this would be ﬁne ’cause Bobs is open
tilz am. Friday, right? 011 no, my friends, instead
they feel they have the power to Shut Bob's down
when ever they want. Not for some legitimate
reason like a lack of workers, it’s for a "private
party”!!! How much of a rip off is that?

It would be one thing if Bob’s had to close for a
legitimate reason or if this private party had been
announced in advance, but oh no, all of a sudden,
Bob’s is closed just because those who work there
abuse the system. Instead, they should remember
that since they nevertum a proﬁt, our money goes
towards bailing them out ,

The ﬁrst Harris party of the year has come and
gone and I was seriously disappointed. What in
the world was the DJ doing?! Where was/were
Madonna, the Backstreet Boys, Britany and
Christina? I like techno probably more than most
people, but some of the songs were incredibly hard
to dance to. Where's the Variety?

Another thing about Harris: I found it really
funny that all you ﬁrst-years were hooking up
everywhere, You can't even make excuse: that you
were drunk, cause it was a dry party!

And one other thing, on the same subject: Don't
make out right next to me on the catwalk, and
don’t stick your hand down your dancin' partner‘s
pants. If this is what we have to look forward to
at Harris, you can ﬁnd me at the Pubs

We print 2000 copes, and, at least last week, all
uftliem were taken from the post ofﬁce by Manday.
I’m not delusional and know that perhaps most of
them were immediatly recycled, used as packaging
or to line your shelves. But some of them must
have been read.

And there lies my complaint. Each week I need
three random rants, Three. I never ever get them
all. I don’t get it, You complain constantly yet not
even three of you can manage to write something
down and email it to me,

Pathetic. .
