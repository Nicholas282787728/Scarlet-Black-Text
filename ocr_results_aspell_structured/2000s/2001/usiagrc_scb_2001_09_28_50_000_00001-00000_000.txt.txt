Security provokes concern A ”crisis" of

Campus officials, student body split on the true role of campus security and its
relation to principles of self-governance

by E ri k G a bl e
Staff Writer

Recent changes in Grinnell Collcgc's
alcohol policy, combined with student
confusion over the role played by [he so
curiry department on campus, have
caused concern in recent ivecits among
members ofstudent governmentwho feel
that scciiriry officers overstepped their
hounds in two recent incidents.

As a result. security director Steven
Briscoe is woridng with SGAJoint Board
and the strident affairs staff to form a
committee of students and staff whose
job will be to act as a vehicle for student
concerns and a line of communication
between students and administrators.

l—latncs scnator Damien spcchr '02
touched offa lively debate last week when
he asked whether security officers could
cnrcr residence halls “without lacing
asked, without being invited, and ivith»
out cause." He iefcrrcd speciﬁcally to two
incidents: one party in Younlter and an»
other in Gates,

On September 7, according to
Briscoc, security received a call complain»
ingahour a drunk person riding a moped
outside Yeiinkci. When a security OmCL‘r
arrived on the seenc, the person left. Thar
officer thcn cnrcicd the party to askstu-
dents if airy of them know who the
moped tldcr was,

On Septemhci- 13, an ofﬁcer driving
on rarit street noticed a crowd of pcoplc
standing in rhcwaiicway between Rawson
and Gates with drinks in their hands. The
officer asked students to move inside.
since city ordinances prohibit drinking
outdoors, Then, hearing noise from inc
side Gates, he entered rite lounge and saw
two kegs and two bottles ofliquor.

At that point, Briseoe said, security
officers wcrc uncle. as to whcrlicr lounge
contracts had to he posted on the door
otitsidc any party, scciiig no contract, thc
ofﬁcer told organizers dist their party was
unauthorimd, and that he would be eaJL
ing : Residence Life Coordinator (RLC)
to come and talk to them about the new
policy.

At that point, students hcgan leaving
the party. Several people, presumably fczlr»
ing disciplinary action, .umpcd our of
windows. When rhc security officer re-
turned to his vehicle. he found that stu-
dents had let the air out ofonc ofiLs titﬂt
stolen thevaivc caps from rheorher three,
and urinared on the side of the car. The
officer was unable to contact the RLC
on call. cratiy said this was hecatise the
RLC's cell phone batteries were dead.

security’s response to the party in
Gates caused the most concern among
members ofloint Board. “The Gates situe
ation was the most outrageous by far,"
said SGA president Paul Ford '02. “The
security ofﬁcer had no legitimate reason
to enter the party."

“I think it is reﬂective ofa climate of
confusion, rear, and anxiety." Ford said,
“and sccrrriry's behavior that evening
played to [hose feats pcrfccrly."

sccunry officer Russ Moira was
puzzled by students extreme reactions
to his colleagues pisscnce. “The whole
scenario docsnt maito any sense," he said.
“Nolaodywas saying you're busted: Nee
body was taio'ng names. They were lust
asking who was in charge. "

student straits deanrom Crady said
that Grinnell docs not tale a punitive
approach to enforcing the alcohol polity.
“our matrr concern here is dangcreus
drinking," he said, “and that we're son.
siolc about the way we irnpicmenr this
policy... and that’s why we're doing a
warning process and not moving it to a
formal iudlclal level."

crady added that officials deal with
organrvers rather than ptirrygoers. “Ifl
walk inter a party, rm going to deal ivrth
the party organizers to hegin with," he
said. “im not going to card peoplc one
by one."

The collegc does have a legal ohiiga.
tion to confront students who violate its
alcohol and drug regulations, “Any eole
legc employee who comes across it has
to criforcc the alcohol policy," crady said,
“That's federal law." if the college failed
to comply with the Ditiger‘icc schools
and Campuses Act, it could stand to lose
all federal funding, including the loans
that male up a substantial portion of
manysrndenis’ ﬁnancial aid Packages.

There is some evidence to suggest
that Joint Board might have overreacted
to a relatively small incident. rat from
experiencing a climate ornustrurr, Morn
reported haying been invited ro several
parties in recent weeks while making his
rounds.

“I completely understand what [sc-
ruriryi did, and I rhinittiiey did thc right
thingrn most respeco," said Cowlcssenae
tor Jacob Kaufmari.oshorn '04, who
witnessed part of the Gates incident.
“From what I saiv outside. people were
not using common sense.”

“My experiences with seculity this
year have been posiuvc.” Kaufman.
osoorn added.

"We’re not hearing anything from
anyone else out there, other than the
people on ioinr Board," said Briscoe.
“Theresa few people on lointBoard who
secrn like they're pretty riled up about
it." But, he added, “1 think we have a
good working relationship with most of
the students on campus"

Nonetheless. security will begin trye
irrg to get ths more involved with re-
sponding to noise complaints. Dispatche
crs will ask rho RLC on call to go and
check out the location of complaints,
rather than immediately sending an or
ftcer.

“Where there are situations involv-
ing violations ofrhc alcohol policy in the
residence halls, RLCs will he the people
dealing with that," Crady said.

“I want Sludcnls to feel that we are
here to help, and whatever we can do to
help them, that's what we're here to fo»
cus on," Brlscoc said. “We’re not here to
‘gcr‘ them."

Ford urged students to try and deal
with prohiems themselves, rather than
involving college ofﬁcials. “Part of this
problem has nothing to do with student
affairs. nothing to do with security," he
said, “and everything to do with those
members ofonr student body who don't
understand the principles of scltgover.
mince."

Some people. howevcr, might not feel
comfortable confronting people directly
about the noise from d-ieir parties “We’ve
had students say, ‘rhcy're druult, they're
unruly, and rhcy'rc bigger rhan i am,”
Briscoe said, “And some students are
afraid of iepeicussions from other Sm-
dcnts. that ifthcy go over and tell rhcm
to turn it down that they'll get mad at
them,"

Security is sometimes hctrcr able to
handle noise complaints than RLCt.
“We're out there 24 hours a day." Briscoe
said. “The RLCs have lo sleep sometime. "
However. hc said he was more than will-
ing to get RLCs more involved ifit would
reassure students about security's role on
campus.

Responding to noise complaints is “a
very small part ofwhar we do," Briscoc
said. The security otfrcc also iumpsrarrs
ears, Ls’carLs students home at night, rc-
sponds to crimes against students, and
takes one oflocking and unloelunghuild»
ings for students and staff

Security officials attrilante many of
the recent misunderstandings to uncer—
mlntydholltwhutexactly the college’s new
alcohol policy means and how it will be
enforced

“There are some pcoplc not icnevv.
ing how they’re going to he affected by
the new policy," Briscoe said. Security
officers do not actually have the power
to discipline students.

“I don’t know what the fear is," said
Briscoe. “What can we do? We can do
nothing more than pass information on
to student affairs, or to an RLC,"

According to Moria, changes in fed-
eral law are constantly affecting students,
administrators, and security officers alike.
“Any time you have a change, you have
uncertainty and fear." he said. "The real»
ity is. across the United States. lnstitu»
rions ofhighcr education have lost a lot
ofsrudcnrs to overdosing on alcohol, so
there is a real push outside ofrhc institu—
iion to do something alaout it."

Off-campus
inﬂation

Offecampus housing is increasing in popularity every year at
Grinnell for many reasons, including the often-cheaper acmmmoda»
trons one can receive ofscampus, However, there are many levels of
ofccampus housing and a wide range of costs, This is particularly
important whilc living in college—owned vcrsus nonecollege owned
housing,

Firsr-yearsrudcnts are required to iivc in the residence halls. The
Cost for on-osmpus housing is $2820 room for academic year and
$3230 for a full meal plan There are many advantages to this choice
including being near tempos and having furniture upon arrival. Meal
plans, however, are required in residence halls. Most older students
still return to live in the residence halls.

“My friends and I wcrcnt strongly motivated to move oﬁ'emmpus.
We couldn't find enough people to live chicampus and when room
dmw came around, my number was really good. so i tooit a chance on
getting a rcslly nice room, and I did," Bred ormeland '02 said.

College-owned housing is anodtar choice, which costs the same as
rtsidcncc living. This requires signing up for a house with other sru.
dcnrs and explaining in detail why you want to live oK-campust stu.
dents in this situation do not have to have a meal plan, but have a
choice to ifdesired.
