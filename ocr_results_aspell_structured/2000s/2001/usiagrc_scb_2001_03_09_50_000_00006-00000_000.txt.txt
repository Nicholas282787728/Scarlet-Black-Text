Redemption through music

When people ask
me why i live on south
campus, 1 tell them
that it is ideal betause
i can stay away from
thejocks and be
nearer to my dealer at
the very same time. Of
course i am saying
this just to keep up
my image as a true-
blcoded Southie.
Unbeknownst to them,
Idan’t have any real
beef with jocks,
besides the fact that
they don’t smell like
patchouli as much as i
would like them to. In
tact, i played three
sports in high school,
four it you count
wamen’s ultimate
frisbee, which you
don’t. And anyway, my
dealer lives off
campus,

The real reason}
live on south campus
is to be nearer tu
Bob's. Bob's to me is
what Grinnell is all
about. Or maybe not.
But it is at least a
pretty cool place to
hang out. Bob’s is a
world of live music,
hot food, cool
company and weekly
bingo,- it is the on-
tampus escape that we
have all been looking
for affscampus.

However, around
this point in the year i
tend to rorget ahout
Bob's. My classes are
In rull swing (i hear),
the weather is still
miserable, and my idea
of relaxing is a 157
minute nap in the
science library, not
talking with a friend
over a cup or corree
and a game or
:ribbaqe, what we
need to remember is
the wide variety or
purposes Bob's can
serve that go far
beyond your rurlsofs
themill, For instance,
whenever you need to
ditch a prasipie, don't
leave them with that
girl on your floor with
no friends ur at a
convocation, ditch
them at Bob's, They
will thank you next
year, iryuu can hear
them over the obscure
music and the
cappucino machine.

North Campus
might have a lot to
error, but Ijtlst can't
think or anything.
Besides, the bells on
my pants are too wide
ror me to fit though
the Morris hallways.
