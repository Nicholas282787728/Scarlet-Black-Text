In many ways, rbar ranking was far more imporranr ro us rban
a number one overall would ever be. since Grinnell bas raised
irs rnirion ar a rasrer rare rlran our granrs, we love losr rliis rop
ranking ro Swarrbmore. saying Financial aid increases Corre-
spondingly grearly simpl lines rbe issue Mucb or ibis ﬁnancial
aid comes in rbe forms orloans. Additionally, many srudenrs
loans already increase arrer rbeir rirsr and second year. If rbeir
ruirion keeps increasing, rlieir loans keep gerring bigber and
rbe overall cosr or rbeir edncarion increases subsranrially, some
srudenrs receive only loan-based ﬁnancial aid, and fc: increases
auromarieally mean more loans. Moreover, rbose srudenrs who
are nor on financial aid ar all are raced, along wirb rbeir rami.

By stating that
”Grinnell students
are admitted on
their ability to learn,
not their ability to
pay,” the admissions
ofﬁce website
expresses a major
tenet of Grinnell’s
philosophy that we
hold dear.
Unfortunately, this
comprehensive fees
raise undermines
that tenet

Aggressive behavior

The conrroversy over rbe conﬁrmarion of Brandon Zicba
as near year's SGA Adminisrrarive Coordinaror bas led me ro

and non»violenl eommuniry. i do nor know zieba personally,
bur aner a lO»pag: email I bave received from my senaror con-
cerning rbe issue, and consulrarion wirb several senior mem-
bers orrlie SGA, pasr and currenr, i bave come so a deep con-
cern regarding Zicba's aggressive rendencies. Zicba liimselfsaid
rbar be never "intentionally" inrimidared anyonecxccpt in one

does inrimidarion necessarily needs so be “inrenrional.>" i be

aggressive and rook [Melis'sl candidacy way roo personally. since
be said rbar be bas only once inrenrionally inrimidared anorber
person, rbe aggressiveness be displayed rowards Melis rbar one
nigbr would be uninrenrional. logically. HOWEVER. DISa
PLAYING AGGRESSIVENESS AND CAUSING FEAR
TOWARDS OTHERS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, INTEN»
TIONAL OR NOT. i wbolebearredly believe Zicba wben be
said rbar be bas no inrenrion on displaying aggressiveness, yer
my concern over wberlier be could eonrrol bis rage remains
sudden rage and anger rbar could lead ro pain? borb emoe
rienal and pbysiaaia does nor require inrenrion ro rake Con»

ing rbe inrimidarion orMelis, caused by bis personal anger and
