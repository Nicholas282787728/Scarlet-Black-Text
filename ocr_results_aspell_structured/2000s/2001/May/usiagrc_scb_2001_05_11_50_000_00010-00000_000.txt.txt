Favortism in

we are concerned about the appearance urravontism that
next year's cabinet appointments may have gtntratetl. and he.
litvo that tho ptoctss rot ﬁlling cabinet positions ought to be
changed.

Mike Chan, the currcmACE coordinator, w1s d:nicd the

there have been no complaints about his ptiiormanee The post
went to Geoff swenson, a personal rncnd orv1ee President.

applied for the position ofAssibrantTrcﬂsurcr, and 1l1e11 ehangcd

want the nvoryenr commumtnt. According to the minutes, he
did not mention this mini artct he had been confirmed. Al.
though 11 seems odd that
anyone would apply rot 1
{ob without knowing how
long 1 commitment was to

that rot now. What is ob.
1eetionable is the fact that

lntttostingly, the posi.

tors seemed unsiite that oppong was actually qualified for the
position, and etitrent Vite Prcslclenl George catioll came out
and said he felt the selection process was unfair.

Although Ford and Rosenberg have 1stuted us that their

11o11udge their qualifications rot itseliowing to the elnndestino

In defense of critics

Mtcr Ben brorman‘s lettet to thc crinncll College com.

only was I appalled, but I felt compelled to derend his tunes,
Throughout his ”dcfcnxc" (which incidentally is longer than
his original column), Brotman objects to each or h1t entics
arguments by repeatingevetything he wrote in his original col»
umii At the same time, storman manages to distepeet and
attack his critics tot haying the audaeiry to offer an oppos—
ing viewpoint? A: a youtnahst on: leaves themselves open to
ctitieism and leaves their words open to interpretation atoiman

teader, and there really aren't too many ways to interpret state.
ments like “Without rorce, iitape was not the intent it was not
tape. it's called lire" (“Rtrhinking the college‘s poliey on rape,"
4/20/01). liMr, broiman thought a statement like that would
not be criticized, especially on this campus, he is, 11 best, igno.
tant oicampus politics.

I felt that Btormans critits made valid points, while not
being overlyctiticalorhis,11guahly. narrow viewpoint. 1 would
have hoped he could have extended them and the Gnnnell
College communiry the same courtesy His olrensive quotes
are too numerous to mtntiona Her: are a few orniy ravotites:
“You ignore the complexity or consent, not I. 1 seek to shed
light on that completity and make aware the policy‘s ambigu.
ous nature" [I am the allrknowlnga l have a column. You will
listen to me.]

“You [the anonymous writer] weie able to comprehend
wh1t l was saying slightly better than the former [the other
critics], however, your attempt to atgue your positions rails
miserably."

“Your ﬁnal sentence is the key problem preventing you
itom understanding what I wrote,"

The theme here, I believe, 1s that Mr. Brorman feels mix»
undetsrootl. perhaps, than, his writing was not clear enough
because I, too, must have misunderstood him because I agreed
with his crit1cs. The po1nt 1 really wanted to make here though

Dear South Campus Loggia Users,

I probably know you better than you think.'Vou
make calls on the phone, talk to your friends, sing
show tunes (badly) under your breath and relieve stress
by screaming in the middle orthe night, all right out-
side my window. I hear. I realize that only a select
group of us have laggia windows, only a select few
with the privilege of hearing your every echoing cry,
but I've been a member of this six or seven member
club fornearing two years new and I'm sick of you. All
of you. Often you‘re drunk and loud, or happy and
loud, orangry and loud. But always loud. Please stop.
It's nice out now. You can sing or stream or gossip to
your heart's content outside where no one will hear. I
certainly don't want too Vou’re boring and I don’t get
enough sleep anyway. Thanks.
