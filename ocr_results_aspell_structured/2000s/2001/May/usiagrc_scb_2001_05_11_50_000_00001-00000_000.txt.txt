SGA President to sit as non-
voting member of the Board of
Trustees and student reps to join

four Trustee committees

Staff Writer

Current SGA President Sean Flammer will be
in England next semester, but the effects or his
presidency will still be felt as the students or
Grinnell College prepare ro send their ﬁrst ofﬁcial
representatives re the Board ofTrusrces.

Tuesday night, trustee Fred Little informed
Flammer that starting n:x( Oerober, the president
ofSGA will be allowed to sit in on board meetings
at the chairs discretion. In February, Flammer
asked lithe SGA president could serve as a voting
member or rhe board; last Friday, president-elect
Paul Ford proposed that he be granted the same
privileges as college president Russell Osgood at
meetings. The board decided that the president
eould attend meetings, but would nor cast a vote
Osgood does not attend executive sessions, and nei-
ther will the president oFSGA.

This decision represents the eulminarion ofrhe
Flammer administration's efforts to break down
barriers between students and trustees. “I think
the board rcall‘Lcs that they are seen as a mysteri-
oiis and outrofrioucl‘l body of decision-makers,"
Flammer said, “and they don't like that. l tliinlt

Over the eourse orthe last year, SGA lias orga.
nized open forums between srudcnrs and trustees
and a program wherein trustees spend a night in
the dorms with students. When the board rejeered
Flammer’s rcqucsr to add a student to its voting
ranlts, Flammer suggested that the president he
allowed to sit in and that students be allowed to
serve on various trustee committees.

Foureommittte chairs have agreed to have two
students serve on their committees. Next year,
SGAWill designate a total oreight students for the
student affairs committee, the audit committee,
the academic affairs committee, and the develop-
ment committee.
