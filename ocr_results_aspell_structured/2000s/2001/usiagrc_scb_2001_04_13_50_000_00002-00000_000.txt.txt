Week- end news briefs

Charlie Brown performance canceled
Due to a lack of males at Saturday's auditions,

Gririiicll Productions’ presentation of Your” Gooerm,

Char/re Brown has been postponed until the fall.

The show, which called for three or four male roles,
was to be directed by T valada, a children’s theatre die
rector hem Des Moines and would have perrormed at
several area elementary schools. Two males auditioned.

The open auditions were heavily advertised on
Grinnell's campus; in Grinnell Productions two years
ofexistance, they have depended heavilyon college stu-
dents for mst members.

Od-ler current productions involving Grinnell stuA
dents are this weekend's Godspell, the semiannual dance
concert, and the mainstage production Our country's
Good.

Osgood on the tuition increase

Answering a request from Joint Board, President
Russell Osgood addressed the body Wednesday on
changes to the college's budget since last year and the
reasoning behind the 7. 5% increase in the college's come
prehensive fee.

The college's large endowment and financial aid
budget, Osgood said, give it a unique financial situae
tiori among liberal arts colleges.

“Last June, our endowment was down 15%; that’s
crept back." he said, explaining that Grinnell depends
upon endowment revenue {or more or its total budget
than any American institution of higher learning ex-
cept possibly Rice University.

other increased expenses included an average 4.5%

“our ﬁnanclal aid budget continues to motor

Corrections

In our Match 16 issue, the artide‘Timalsina to speak

as essentially fundamentalist in nature." Though
Timalsina's views on the topic are complex, they are in
no way hostile. The Sé-B regrEB the error.

Legal background

Administration and police say that college is just like any other part
of town and police may continue to bust parties

by David Nathan
Staff Writer

Thearrival etsrvctal police ofﬁcers at Saturday‘s
Mary B. James Harris Party has left many students
uncertain about Grinnell College's policy towards
roivn police.

Many students at the party thought olheers were
not allowed on campus, and several said that they
understood that there was some kind of formal
agreement between the college and the police form
banning ofﬁcers from campus.

According to Vice President otSrudent Services
Tom Crady, these perceptions are inaccurate “'lr isnt
true under any circumstances [that there is an agree
merit between the college and the policei,” said
Crady. “I’ve been here almost
20 years, and that's never
been true..,H:rns Center,
the Forum, the PEC, for
health and safety reasons.
these spares are public racilre
tres. We want police otricers
and ﬁre ﬁghters to know their
layouts."

At the same time, poliee
officers are expected to treat
Grinnell students like any
other citizen of Grinnell

“There should be no fa-
voritism either way," said
Crady Dorm rooms are are
rorded more privacy than
other campus spaces. Ofﬁcers who want to investi-
gate student rooms must have a warrant. As for
Harris and other on campus public spaces, police
are free to investigate rrrhry are called to campus
for any reason.

“lraln on campus] party is too loud, and the
neighbors call, police go in. People need to know
that," said Crady. “Also, if we observe drugs at a
party, we call the police. That has been our policy
for 10 years.” lfther: is :in alcohol-related problem
on campus, the poliey is to involve an RLC. This

ship with the police may go back to the late 1960:
and early 19705. At that time, many colleges and
universities around the country did term special
contracts with local police forces that the school

would create its own police force
that tulhlled speciﬁc require»
ments.

In exchange, the local police
forces stayed otrcampus. Many
schools still have police pro
grams like this; UCLA, tor ex-
ample, still has its own police
iotce. Grinnell, however, has
never had such a program.

exclaim he was drunk.

The otricer also noticed cups otbert around rho
hallway. At this point, the ofﬁcer called for assis-
tance and entered Harris hall, where he suspected
underage driniting was taking place, Police omeers

“We do not need breathaly-‘rcrs," said Peterson

this weekend, the student said he was drunk."
