cute and jaded

Our picks for what’s up, what’s
new, what‘s to see, and what to do

by Skye Hibbard and
Dallas Swonsort
Columnists
Artist Exhibition
Skye. Some ofyou may have noticed William
Pergl's artwork on display at the Bucksbarini
Gallery in the past few weeks. The coolest one is
a woodworking that looks like the ribs ofa ﬁsh
or a lopsided but beautiful basket turned upside
down. Whatever that means. Nevertheless.
Today at 4 30 a solo exhibition ofPergl's recent
seulptute comes to the Bucksbaum Center
rotunda and it would be a great way to spend a
beautiful Friday arteriioon before the evening
events begin.
Dallas Professor Pergl has recently been
appointed to the studio on faculty here at
Grinnell, hence the exhibition ofhls works. If
you don’t make it to the opening you’ll miss out
our the typical reception food, but you’ll still
have a chalice to see Pcrgl’s wotk thlough the
end of the semester.

Grinnell Singers Concert

Skyc' Next on your agenda is the concert given
by out own talented Grtnncll Singers at 7:30
tonight, also in the Bucksbaum Center, The
choir is led by my adviser iohn Roininci-eiin and
includes my roommate, so ofcourse i went to
their performance last semester. It’s relaxrng to
sit in Sebnng—Lewls Hall and let their airy
voices waft over you, Just think oi‘tt as a way to
let go orthc stress from classes and focus your
attention where it really should be: the weekend.
Dallas: Or you could focus on the music. I don't
think musicians are too keen on people day
dreaming through their performances.

Skye. 0h, sliusli, Why you gotta be like that?
Look at you, tltiltkin’ you’re all jaded See? Told
you [ was the cute one.

“Ma 'Be James” or “The Gender Fender
Bender”

Dnllas: Come one, come all Maiy be James and
James be Mary. ..or however you prefer.
Personally, i think l’lllusl be lnelry. We‘ve
been waiting all year for this dance that truly
sets Gt’tnnell apart as the weirdest school in
Iowa

Skye: I think it shows that the students here are
really Iaidrbaek about gender issues. You girls
out ll’tCICVlltiS may be our only chance to dress
up our guy i‘rieiidsl It‘s funnier to dress them up,
since we all know women look good no matter
what we weal

Dallas: Come see all of your transvestite friends
this Saturday at Harris, l0:00 to 1:00. That
gives you plenty of time to run to the Second
Mile during the day, so there‘s no excuse for any
men dressed as women dressed as guys.

Grinnell Faculty Strip Tease

Dallas; Don’t go digging around for yorir
glasses; you read that headline right, All ofyour
favorite plol'cssors will be parading around
campus for the somewhat under-publicized
“Love Your Professor‘s Body Week" beginning
at noon on Saturday Due to school regulations
students are unfortunately not encouraged to
join the parade of flesh. Organizers of the event
are hopeful that many students will line up from
Norris to Main to support their favorite faculty/
staff.

Skye. Whoo hool Talk about being comfortable
With different body images. Just be glad it’s not
Cold anymore.

Caricature of herself or not,
Dolly Patton’s new Country

Wanna heara great record choekafull ofsopl-llsti-

[Don’t believe rnc> I don’t blame you—vrhis is hrrd

her image. Let’s nor mince words here' we’re talk

But on Little Sparrow, l’arton ditches rhc dcrrn
