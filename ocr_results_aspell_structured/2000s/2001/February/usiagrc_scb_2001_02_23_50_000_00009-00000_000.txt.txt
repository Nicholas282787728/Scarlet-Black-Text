‘I had a major and a Concentration’

Late last year a certain rierce bookstore employee
(who shall remain nameless) and 1 were rallting about
the desolate romantic situation ori this campus. We
decided that the best way to procure some “booty"
for ourselves would be to do it under the guise of
academia. since then, 1 have lied considerable time to
consider this ideaThe result orthis engaging thought
process has created an academic program Whlch I be»
lieve is not only bound to shape the desti—
nies or many ruture Grinnellians, but also
provide current students with quit: a bit
offun.

Thus it is with great pride that 1 inc
troduce the sexusl studies Con-
centrationThc concentration
is to be, like everything at
Grinnell, a pursuit orthe libe
eral arts. set, after all, is the
most liberal or the arts. The
Concentration will draw upon a rew eore eourses but
also require studies in orher departments.

The core curriculum is to be as follows:

- SEX 101: Beginning sexual Techniques. An
introduction to the idea or being a caring nurturer
while at the same time being a biter. students will
master the delectable combination ofscxllzl prowess
and emotional intimacy.

- SEX 19s: sexual studies I. This is, perhaps,
the best reature orthe curriculum. This is a practicum
eourse, one orthree in the concentration, which re.
quires that the student engage in various sexual cxer»
clsls with a partner, Grades will be assigncd based upon
the “afterglow“ picture and the scene orrhe room in
which the exercise has praetieed while this may seem
subjective. inere is to be no “kissing and telling" within
the 500131 studies Department. Materials ror this
course will boon rescrve in Burling. The “partner: a

we all need a little sexual healing. This course would
be dedicated to self—healing through sexual methods
as well as sensual massage techniques.

- sex 29;: Sexual studies 11. Much lilse the ﬁrst
practicum course, this will be a practicumebnsed
course, which will require checking out the "boory

hours. This coursewill espand from the more typical
sexual environments and exercises are to be practiced
in various campus locales.

The techniqucs'are also to
