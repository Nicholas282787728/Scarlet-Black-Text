Grinnell archaeologist

It's obvious that Grant McCall ’01 has his mn-

pology student has found himself ﬂooded with rt»
quests to dernbe ho artheologiol crploio to vari—

The implement was familiar because it looked
like the ones had seen photos ofin his tattbooks on
mtly human allture, The picnic wt: in Namibia.

As evidence began to accumulate that do site

department picked up his story and circularod it for

to the dimctdties ofooming to a decision that involvod diireting opinions.
Asked about how a decision was made in the race of conflicting views.
Hunter said. “the eommlttce never saw its goal as demanding a consensus: we
saw our goal as teaching what agreement we could and reporting fairly what
disagreement remained." Hunter said that the rotateh done by the tomrnit
tcc members “involved smelting many websites, including those oftheWRC,

oftli: FLA, and ofwllegs and universities which have struggled with these:

issues, and reading what the organizations said about their own goals, their
srnicturc, and their planned proecdures." Hunter also said that all members of
the committee played coually important roles in the decision, and that “the
students [on the committce] did a marvelous job."

A press release, paired with a committeerwritten report, was circulated
Dec. 13. in the report, the committee recogniztd that there were differences
ofopinion in the committee, but said that “abandoning membership [ofthe
FLA} because orconcerns about potential effcetivtnec orthe FLA isprema.
turc. . The report reasoned that “relatively littlt mn be known about the way
either do FLA or WRC will operate in practice and about their eftceriveness,
because both are very new organisations still in the formative stage."

For these reasons, the committee, and ultimately the board ofl‘rustccs,
decided that the college should continue to be a member otthe FLA. and to
join the WC as well.

GCSAS was surprised by the Board of Trustees Dee. decision on the
swcauhop issue, because it did not aspect a vote on the issue until the board
meeting nort wcck. GCSAs said it did not have enough time to voite ic
opinion on the issue.

l-lowcver, President Osgood ssterrs that in October, when the Board first
petitioncd the Add-inc Committee on Swatchop labor to bc assembled. it
asked for the committee to rcply as soon a possible, no later than February,
on a recommendation on the swntshop issue.

GCSAS did not learn ofthe Board's decision until this week. and is plan
ning 1“No sweat" wcck, which will possibly include an open forum on the
issue and a tdly during the trustee’s meeting. Osgood said “thc trustees une
demand this dedsion to bc a dynamic and fluid thing, and will continue to -
talk to GCSAS."
