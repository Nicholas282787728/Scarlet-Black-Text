To te Head of

Or How I Learned to Escape Academia

A Grinnell alum who went onioi .
Teach for America shares her r
experiences

While in her nrsr year of reaching or Andrew Hill High
school in San Jose, Andrienne Enriqutc ‘98 was sioppcd by a
school ofﬁcial and asked why she wasn’t in uniform. Con-
ﬂlsed, she explalned d-lar she didn't realize that she, as a teacher,
was required so wear rho same unirorrns as rhc srudcnrs. It
went the only time she was mlrraleen for a srudenr.

As a 21»year-old college graduare, Entiqucz joined Teach
For America (TFA), The program roeruio college students or
all maiors w commlt so a tweeyear teaching nssignmenr in
same oFAmcriea’s most under-resourced school districtsTFA
reachers are hired and paid as orher ﬁrstryear teachers. How.
ever, a TFA corps member is anly hired after the school dis-
trict has exhausted its pool of certiﬁed or credentialed teache
ers. This policy, made between TFA and individual school
disrriers and enforced by law, helps coneenrrareTl-‘n’s human
reources on the moss needy schools.

The summer afterTFA applicants are aeoepred, they par.
ticipate in a six-week intensive training, In addition to learn-
ing abour basic skills like making lesson plans and classroom
management. parr orrhe rraining enrailed reaching at sum.
mer school sessions, Though Enriquez said that she felt “ab-
solurely prepared" to go inro the classroom arrer she com.
pleted her training. she said mar in die years since she scarred
reaching, the rraining program has improved dramatically
Enriquez says rhar she would feel ren times more prepared
had she gone rhrough the rraining altered now

Enriquez’s typiml day reaching was “probably what youd
imagine a reacherdoes, and then some," She raughr nve classes
of high school math, tutored students after school, acted as a
sophomore class adviser, and also arrendedsdiool sporrs evenrs
and chaperoned dances on weekends.

Her constant involvement with students both in and out
orrhe classroom was made even more challenging because of
she lackorprepararion and resources available so rhesnrdenrs.
“One ofthe things dlat was really hard for me was to watch
my srudenrs and know how capable rhey were and to know
that daeir education was not sufﬁcient to enable them to atr
tend a school like Grinnell,m she said. “By virtue of where
they had been born and the school rhoy were acrending, they
weren'r receiving the proparanon."

In addirion to eomponsanng for rhe disadvantages stu-
denrs are racing in underresourced districts across rho coun-
rry, TFA also rrios ro crease systemic change in rho oducacion
sysrcm, according to Enriquec. Aldmugh a sirable pornon
(Enrique: CsKlmaIES more than half) ofTFA teachers remain

in she classroom airer meir twaeyear rcrm is done, many TFA
alumni also pursue careers in orher areas. consequenrly, rhe
TFA leaders hope so make sure rhere are child and education
advocares in legal, medical, and other professional communi-
ties. “its nor just whar happens in classrooms, it's what hap—
pens anerwards," Enriqun said.

Doug Curehins, Direcror orrhe omce nfSceial Came

primarily posirive, bur rbcy acknowledgo that rhere are some
valid criticisms, The main drawback is diat the reachcrs are
only required to sray for two years. making rliem somewhat
tempurary members otrhe eomrnunicy they serve. “I drink
abour mykids and I rhink abour the her that I left," Enriquec
said “I am: inro a communicy diar I wasn'r Familiar wid-l,

Cutchins asked, "If [TFA

He also recalled a cone

that she teachers she was

was hiring from university
ednearion programs. she
said she'd scarrrhc entire

you ger a studenr ro care? How do you making reaching rel-

student learn who's racing huge turmoil as home?"

Tho rransirion from college to reaching is a profound one,
Enriquez said. “In couege, you're only beholden ro yourselt

Although she tells srories oreonaing home after work and
going so sleep as 5 pm. and not waking up until the next
morning, Enrique: also said “the kids make you willing to do
that.”
