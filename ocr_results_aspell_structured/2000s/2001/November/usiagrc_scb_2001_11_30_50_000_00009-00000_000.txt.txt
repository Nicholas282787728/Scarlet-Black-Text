This college has a much higher technology budget than
it deserves, And yet, I don‘t understand why it is so hard
for the college to ﬁnd photocopiers that make double-
sided copies, and computers that have disk drives. I don't
think itis so extravagant of me to want (1) to save paper,
and (2) not to buy an ethernet card, or (worsel) to live

Dearest bicycle thief of mine,

I know I had it coming I'm one of those people who
doesn't always lock their bikes, Well, doesn't ever actually.
[lost the lock and can’t find it and I still have the key and
I carry it around with good intentions but without the
lock it’s really hard to do much good. And I know that.

And I also know that last week might have been enough
to teach me, and certainly would have been enough to
teach someone else. YES, my dearest bike got stolen and
taken to Norris last week as well and I still didn’t lock it.

But now it’s gone again, and I stand by the fact that
it’s not my fault. In bygone days of my blissful youth, I
could safely leave my bike unlocked for days, weeks, months
at a times That was true for the first half of this Semester
even. Evil has descended since Thanksgiving.

Little tiny editorial

The ofﬁcial stance on student initiatives is that they
matter. The SGA website says that “SGA, [the] adminis-
tration, and the writers of the initiative will work to-
gether to implement the initiative."

If this were true, shouldn’t someone keep track ofwhat
the past initiatives were and how they did? Shouldn't
someone know what passed and what didn’t in the past
few years? We shouldn’tjust have to rely on the memory
of wistful seniors. But as we set out, in our roles as in-_
tiepid journalists, to discover the effectiveness of past
initiatives, we discovered that no one knew Sometimes
the 5&5 reported the results, often not.

People need to know, ten years from now, that this
college did not support the construction of a bordello.
This publication should not be the only record, But it
probably will bel
