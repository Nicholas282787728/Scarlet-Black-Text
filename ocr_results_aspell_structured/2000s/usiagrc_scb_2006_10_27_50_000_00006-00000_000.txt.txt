Acclaimed director Martin Scorse-
se's thriller T/ieDsp/ma will probably
be seen as his own cinematic creation,
But what the public likely doesn’t know
is that Scorsese's film is based on a
Hong Kong ﬁlm entitled Itﬂl'lm/Af
fall's.

Last month, from Sept. 25-29, Stu»
dent group Asian Students in Alliance
(ASIA) staged a ﬁlm festival to high
light Iii/o till/Af-
fairs and other
films from Asian
counttics. With
the festival, the
group hoped
to celebrate the
cultural differ»
cnces between
Asian countries,
n5 well as ro feature the original Asian
cinematic gems that often times inspire
Hollywood knockrotl's.

“ASIA as a cabinet and [its mem-
bers] felt that the main stereotype tor
Asians [is that] rliere rs no separation

”We wanted to Show, ’Well, this is
another aspect, this is anatnerculture cnt

ing at the students here,”

between Koieans, Vietnamese, Filipi-
nos, Chinese, etc. were all viewed as
one," said event coordinator and ASIA
cabinet member Diana Phunchuong
’07. “The main reason for doing the
film festival is to show people on cam-
pus [that] ASIA, as a group, consists of
very different cultures."

The festival presented ﬁve foreign
films, selected by ASIA’s members.
The films were shown over the couise
or live days with
each night repre-
senting a differ-

According to
Pl‘iunchuong,
the festival shicd away from a COilCSlVL‘
theme, and instead, simply picsented
the dive‘tsity ufgcntes and perspectives
within the different countries.

“Most of the movies that we those

she said. “We wanted to show, ‘Wcll,
this is another

The group
held two view-
ings per movie,

“[ASIA and
its members]
were worried
[the ﬁlms] would
give off those
stereotypes and
people would
stay with rliena,"
said PhilnchUc

as it creates a dialogue, that's something
that’s good.”
