Tagline: Would you erase me?

Wlmt it you received n letter in the lnail say»
mg that someone erased you from their memory>
Charlie Kaufman's answer ro that question isEmr
inr/ sent/ripe rfr/rr Spar/en Mimi, a complicated
story of lovely lost mcmor . In this hypotltetir
cal situation, Joel (Jim Currey) reeeives this magic
letter from his impulsive eXrgirltnend Clementine
(Kate Winslet). out or equal parts revenge and
sorrow,]ncl hastily has Clementine removed from
his memory The film begins with Joel and Clem-
entine's Clumcc meeting after the operations. with
neither they nor the audiencc aware of the difficult
and dehrious history they shnre.

Filling in the blanks in this movie is the star
ry of Lacuna, lnc., the company that offers the
memory removing service. Lacuna has a colorful
roster: Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson),
the sofrrspoken inventor of the procedure; Stan
(Mark Ruffalc). his bespectacled assistant; Pat-
rick (Elijah Wood). the barely beyond adolescent
thirdri rcommand; and Mary(Kirsten Dunst), the
worshipping secretary. Their personal stories play
out parallel to Joel: memory erasing, as three love
stories emerge amongst the confused morals of this
soft science ﬁction.

The ﬁnal name in this all—star creative cast (yes,
you r/mu/r! know Tom Wl kinson) is director IVll»
chel Goudry. Gendry is best known tor his work
in musrt videos, lueludlngTht White Stripcs'wrlv
Lego “Fell in Love with a Girl."Hc and Kaufman
collaborated on the movre Human Nature. a film
best left unknown. ,

Gondry brings his sense of Cxpcl’lmcnmrlon
and camcm trickery from the tlu’CC'minutC White
Stripes‘ music video into this lOS—minutc feature
him. Not one seeond lacks strikingvisuals emmmed
with snazzy camera angles, colors and special er-
fects hoth loWAtech and high. Unlike some Holly—
wood blockbustcrs about which rhc same could be
said, Gondry uscs his tricks to let the audience ch
pcriencc the tumultuous, tremendous connections
these characters create and annihilate.

Elrl'rm/ Emir/rule, a film about lost love and lost
memory, presents many visceral, distilled emotions
and experiences, like heartbreak, rorgethrlness, in-
nocence, humiliation, and love. By the story's end,
the audience and the characters learn most ot'whrlt
has happened to them, and rather than having a
whinbang ending, rhey accept their actions and
reactions us a necessary but nor always desired fact
oflife, whether or not they'll remember it the next
day.

Never has a story about obtaining exit visas
been so good We should all be happy that the
best, or at least the most quoted, dialogue in
movie history will be echoing across central cam-
pus tonight.

(Kill Bill Volume 2 (R)
Tagline: The Bride is back for the
final cut.

When we left The Bride (Uma
Thurman) in Japan, she just cut on
Lucy Liu's head with her special Hat-
tori Hanzo sword that we were told
time and again was really sharp.
Now The Bride returns to the U.S. for
a tale straight out or the Old West.
Interlwined with tales of the Bride’s
ruined wedding rehearsal and martial

ans training, the second half or uuen-
tin Tarantino's blood-coated epic has
his heroine ﬁnishing her revenge on
the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.
including the titular Bill (David Car-
radine), his mischievous assistant Elle
Driver (Darryl Hannah) and his whis-
key-Soaked brothel Budd (Michael
Madsen). Something tells me that Peter
Mediators won't be able to solve this
group’s problems.

Combined, the two volumes of Kill

Bill create a layered and lovely story
of betrayal, revenge and redemption or
the most heartless killers. But they are
not a single ﬁlm, In theme and cons
tent, they are unmixable. The first ﬁlm
is almost entirely flashy knife-, gun-,
and swordplay, with some of the most
precious, vicious ﬁghting captured on
ﬁlm. Tonight's choice at Harris is much
slower, grittier, and emotional. There
are still some great, gruesome fights,
but now they’re between two people

whu truly hate, or even truly love
each other, not between a woman in
a jump Suit and 30 masked men. The
Characters in the two movies are the
same, but the character of the movies
differs greatly.

While l was mildly upset at the
lack of a climax—The Bride must kill
Bill in the end—I smiled throughout
this heart touching and heart punts
turing movie,
