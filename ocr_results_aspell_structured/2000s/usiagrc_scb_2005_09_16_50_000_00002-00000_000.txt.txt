3v EMILIA GARVEV

When Lola Garcia ‘05 found out
thar the Hearing Board, a College judir
Cial board for issues more serious than
those brought to Judicial Counsel,
had tiled only one senial assault case
in recent years, her concern prompted
her to action. “I hadn’t known that so
few assaults had been reported,” she
said. “There was no system in place
to protect and advocate for victims or
survivors or to provide them with re-
sources.”

Now, atrer working on implemcnc
ing rhc campus Advocates program
for almost a year, Garcia and David
Degeest ’06, along with Chaplain
Deanna Shorb, Lilly Intern Brian
Campbell and 17 student volunteers
are about to change the system.

The way the administration deals
with sexual assault can result in Urle
.comfortable situations, due to a variety
of laws and college procedures. Shorb
said. “Students don't know where to
go, and they may be encouraged ro do
things they don’t want to do."

Garcia said that on campus only
RLCs and the chaplain are trained to
deal with sexual assault, and it is unr
clear to concerned students who can
grant them conﬁdentiality. “Once the
administration knows, their onlyjob is
[0 see justice scrved,"said Garcia.

Campus advocates work where ju-
dicial proceedings cannot. “An driver
cate is someone who is on the victim’s

or survivor's side no matter what, and
supports their decision, whatever it
may be," said Garcia.

Advocates also help those aware of,
but not directly affected by sexual as-
saulr. “This can be for secondary, tcte
riary vicrirns as well," said Degeest.

Student volunteers have worked
as advocates for assault and abuse

recently, srudcnt groups have worked
with the Marshalltown—based Do—
mestic .Violence Alternatives/Sexual
Assault Center (DVA/SAC). The ore
ganization provides staterapproved
training to advocates so that they can
help victims in the larger Central Io-
wan community However, there was
no speciﬁc training for dealing with
sexual assaults involving Grinneu Col-
lege students.

“If you wanted to use their serviCr
es, you would have to call the center in
Marshalltown and rhey would contact
an advocate in Grinncll," said Shorb,

“Students didn’t feel served by it, so
students moved to change it."

“This is the first group of its kind
to be exclusively for Grinncll college
students," said Garcia.

Last year Giirciii contacted stu-
dents about training as advocates
through the JustSex and Feminist Ace
rion Coalition mailing lisrs. In early
seprembcr, 17 students completed
DVA/SAC’s twenty—hour training.
“That so many students were willing
to sit through that training reﬂects an
acknowledgment of the need for this
prOgIain," said Garcia. They will go
through another 12 hours of colleges
Speciﬁc training. “The program will be
lead by DVA/SAC and college staff,"
said Garcia,

Once the training is ﬁnished, the
advocacy program will begin. A broad
advertising campaign will be launched.
“It will be consistent.Theie will be i »
formation in every barhroorn stall,"sald
Garcia. Althougli advocate identities
will be kept conﬁdential, the campaign
will let people know what advocates
do, and how to Contact them.

Garcia hopes that this pme
gram will be a powerful resource for
Grinnell students. In past work with
DVA/SAC, she said, “Students didn’t
feel a strong connection to what they
were doing. "

“No one undcrsrands college sme
dents better than other college stir
dents,”
