”Each time I re-read it, something new 'i‘littll
pops up-ethat’s the beauty of a good
book, the intricacies and little secrets
that the author tritti‘ngly or unwittingly
left there for you to ﬁnd each time you
to read it. The tears don't come
anymore, but this book still stirs up
those basic basic feelings that remind

me or what humanity is allabout.”

Gardner Lounge

From the basements of Madisun, Wis. to the tops of
the college charts, they come to the hallowed rock venue
that is Gardner Lounge. Rainer Maria returns to Grinnell
College on Saturday the 13th for another night or
poignant rock and hardcore poetry. Students who had too
much homework, didn’t know they liked liainer Man‘a yet
or were still in the quiet halls of high school when the
group came last year ivill now have their nrst chance to
see the venerable indie rock group in action.

routed often as an intensely brash, brainy group, the
trio might just be perfect tor the Grinnell College crowd.
Thoughtful, succinct lyrics bring to mind the German
symbolist poet, iiainer Maria iiilke, who the group i:
named atter the group consists of kyle Fischer on guitar,
William Keuhn on drums and Caithlin De Marrais on bass,
De MEVlBlS also takes on the bulk of VDCZIS, Shifting her
powerrul voice almost eitortlessly ironr ouiet, gut
wrenching tunes like Situation: Relation, to all-out guitar
rockers like Eur: Ring, They are the kind of hand that can
alleviate or add to any mood~tragie joyful, and at
course, hittersweetly amorous. The immaculate rawness uf‘
their melodies only serves to further their established
indie reputation.

Songs from Long knives Drawn, Rainer Maria’s latest
album, will certainly reature heavily at their upcoming
concert. The album is a mix of righteous romantic anger
and handsuhrowneup exhaustion. Reﬂecting on rhe Awful
mm of loving, the universal tragedy comes acrossellirs
a dilemma/ or boys and girls for centuries/ do i really
know you?/du you really need me?” Maturity, they posit,
is at the emotional center or most relationships. rhey
sum up the immature destructiveness or love in long
Knives —"Let’s get over each other/so that we can fall in
love again.” It is bitter breakup music at its best,

Rock poetics will be the order oi the night, with
Denali, another buyrgirl indie band with a decidedly
dirrererrt vocal presence. Maura Davis sings cleanly and
effusively over driving guitars, drums, and electronics.
Doors open at Gardner at 9 pm. and the show starts at
9:30 Saturday. Whether you are already a huge fan, you
missed them last year, or are curious alrout their place in
college rock royalty, don’t nriss Rainer Maria this time
around.
