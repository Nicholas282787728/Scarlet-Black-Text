Differing opinion.

by Leslie Boyadjian

in 1995 debates broke out at Grinnell regarding cultural
and multicultural spaces on mmpus. One rssue was about
the establishment ofhouses to be used as eulrural spaces. An-
other issue, highlighted in the Feb. 24 issueoftlre we, ques.
tioned the multicultural approach at Grinnell, in the class-
room and on the mmpus at large. Se’rB sports editor Chris
Pallas ‘98 submitted an editorial that forced the campus to
consider the Ilse and role of the multictdtural approach.

in his editorial, Pallas argued
that the use ofa multicultural
method was “impractical” and fur
tile because “especially at the col.
lege level, you can’t roteo some-
one to learn about other cultures.
And those individuals who are
open minded enough to take a
course focusing just on black or
nativeAmcricanhistory probably
aren’t die ones causing racial ten
sion in oursocicty." Another tea»
son the approach is futile, Fallas
stated, is that “it is impossible to educate every individual
about every possible culture.

He went on to say that the idea behind multiculturalism
may be 'rlawod While stating that agreeing that some rat-
ism was probably the result of ignorance Pallas stated that a
grestdeol can probably betrased to the xenophobia thatsonrcs
to most people almost instinctively.”

Pallas also spoke to the notion that actually rmplertrente
ing multiculturalism is problematic and contended that “the
emphasis on the uniqueness ofa culture can be taken so far
that it leads to the alienation of other cultures." Pallas argued
that this sort of distinction between cultures dien “create[s]
an alter centrism where radaer than attempting to create a
eompromising viewpoint a minority group will dornand that
everything be soon from rts gcrspcctivc” .rcplac[|ng] a bi-
ased Eutoccntric yardstick with an equally warped ouc

Pallass final point centered around affirmative action cf-
fotts, which, in the spirit of creating “the illusion of
multieulturalism tan supersede the commitment to a real
multicultural environment.” He went on to say that “the
college pursrres an ambitious affrrmative action employ
ment program at all levels ofhrring with little regard to the
quality of the candidate or actual contributions he or she
might malts.”

A second editorial written by Pallas. also published in the

Lucinda Moore ‘95, an Afri»
cantAmerican student, reacted to Pallas’s comments about
afﬁrmative action, calling him “so naive" nud saying “[t]he
purpose ofamrmarive action is to give QUALIFIED non-
white individuals a root rn the door."

Faculty response in 1995

Professor Kesho stott, soeiology, also wrote a response
to Pallas’s February 24 editorial for the March 3 issue. Scott
asked Pallas, “What is your evidence for asserting that I am
an unqualiﬁed hcrrlry memberathlnneU College?”5he dren
asserted diat Pallau’ editorial was “not only ahistorical but
teﬂect[ed] a lack ofinrormarion about rlre origins and appli»
cation of affirmative action policies." claiming that Pollas's
“slander” was “not based on any factual information," point»
ingspcciﬁcally to a remark about “colored sanitation work-
ers" that Pallas made in reference to the lack oflninoriries on
Gtinncll College stafE

In her letter. Scott demanded. “a face to ﬁt: or written
apology in the next ten days," saying that Pallas's failure to
provide one would “be proofof [his] racism."

Then College President Pam Ferguson. Mathematics, {Cr
sponded to Pallas’s editorial in regard to his comments on
affirmative action, Ferguson stated, “Grinnell’s mission is to
prepare its graduates to be successful and responsible lIIeln»
bers of the community in which they live. In the 21st cent
tury, out graduates will live in a diverse society and they will
need a broad understanding of international issues. There
fore, we strongly support diversity as a component or the
undergraduate experience at Grlnncll. To tocornplrsh this
goal, rho college recruits the best and the brightest studeuo,

faculty and staff members from across the nation and around
the world."

The response today

The issues presented in Palm’s editorial and the responses
it provoked are not a thing of the past at Gtinnell college.
students and faculty are srill eoneerned about how to eﬁee
tivsly employ a multicultural curriculum. Pallas stated, “it's
impossible to educate every individual about every possible
culture,” While few members of the community would are
gue that a multiculturalism is an easy approaeh but many
also feel that just bemuse it is a diﬁ‘icult does not mean that
such an approach should not be attempted.

“I would classrfy [this difrrcultyj as ‘die good,” said former
prcsideut ofdre college. George Dtalrc, History. “Anything
we rcaeh, we’re teaching just snippots ofit.. .So you shouldn’t
teach it because we can't bc complete? We’re going to be in-
complete. So you try to do it. And the talour ora really good
liberal arts toaehor is to pick those tlrornes that are important
and ofintctest and to get students thinking about them
by exploring college is just the beginning. So its just not a
solid argument .The best is always the enemy ofthc good,
or- almost always. In the real world you have to make some
promises.”

And indeed, there seems to be a consensus that
multicultural Cducauun, while “incomplete," is effective in
that it fosters learning how to think about something in a
different way.

Katya Gihel Azuulay, Anthropology, said she tries to ens
courage such a way of thinking in lrcr classes. She said that
sho‘d like to “have somcono in a classroom where when some»
body jusr says white American somebody else turns around
and says Well em you defne what you mean? so that rhars
taken for granted Perhaps theres somebody at the room
who looks" whi but happens to have a very diverse set of
famin histories. Or somebody else who turns out to look
brown but actually grew up in small town Iowa in a white
fnnrily. Those markets shape how you are, it's amazing how
our classrooms are generic even in how they sound. . .People
who have a strong southern inflection or strong east coast/
NY inﬂection are needed in the same room so when some
body says ‘maiusrreanr America’ they can say ‘wait a minute,
what do you mean ‘rnainstream America?”

Pallas seems to share Azoulay's View of diversity within
American “culture." In his second editorial he stated that.
“white society is extremely diverse; white people find berng
genetaliaed into a group just as insulting as ruinorrtres do.
American history hardly reaches the history of all white
people. "
