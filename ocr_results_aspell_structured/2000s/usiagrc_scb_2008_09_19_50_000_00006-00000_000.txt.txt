New Jersey band rocks Gardner by both going back to
and expanding the sounds of the 80’s

While punk rock may not be the first thing

The album, which draws its name from the

many similarities with the fictional holiday,

when informing us oftheir grievances and the
simplicity of rhe album’s rock equals the minis
maList quality of the Festivus Pole.

Beyond their postmodern holiday inﬂur
ences,Titus Andtonicus mostly focuses on the
fuzz ofa guitar played loudly. Between the dis
rotted sounds ofthe guitars and Stickles‘voice,
the band can sound like a fuzzed—out E Street
Band, But at heart, their sound takes more
from early '80s punk bands like The Replace-
ments, with Stickles' yelp often making one

so you guys have a new
album and we were wanders

ing if you were going to be

playing any songs otf of it

and if so, which songs?

Rob: The set we're playing on the tour is
pretty heavy on the new record [and] the only
tracks we're not playing [from] it are a few ins
strumental songs.

How would you describe your music, on
your own terms?

Rob: lfl were trying to explain it to my
mothet who doesn't listen to anything except
for like contemporary country music, I would
say it's really layered rhythmic music that's
pretty atmospheric, but that's really boring.

Mary: I usually say that it’s crafted Like
electronic music but using acoustic sounds.

Rob: Yeah, that's actually a good one. It's
like electronic music that’s made up of acoustic

think oftheir frontman Paul Westci'berg.

But Titus Andronicns doesn't just draw
on the rebellion of the past, and on songs like
“Upon Viewing Brneghel's ‘Landscape With
The Fall Of Icarus,” they add in the larger
sound that indie—rock bands like Arcade Fire
popularized while maintaining the simplicity
oftheir punk roots.

So what are these grievances that Titus
Andronicus want to airPWitl‘i song names like
“No Future"and “Albert Camus," the band of-
fers up its fair share of existential dread. But

more than anything, the
band wants to rail against
suburban life. Taking their
name from Shakespeare's
ﬁrst written tragedy (and
one of his bloodiest), Ti—
tus Andronicus don't offer
their listener much hope. But while their mu-
sic may make you depressed about the subur—
ban youth ofAmerica, their welltwrittcn lyrics
and ear-piercing throwback sound ovetcome
any dread they may inspire.

so if your concept ofthe '80s is more Mia
not Threat than Madonna, you may want to
skip out on Harris and get some punk thrasht
lug at Gardener. And who knows, maybe you'll
even get to see a Festlvus miracle.

sounds that we make ourselves as opposed to
like synthesized sounds. Good job, Mary!

Do you have any speciﬁc memories of
your last visit to Grinnell?
Rob: Yeah,l remember being literally in the
middle of just farm land when
.: you get off the exit and it looks
the same except there‘s a college
j there and obviously it's not a
huge college, but us a noticeable
' college and I remember thinking
“Oh, I wonder what this show is
1 gonna be like?"1 remember the
show being just packed,llkc with
so many people. We played with
the Blow last year. Do you re
member that show?

Yeah, I do.
Rob: It seemed like a lot of people weren't
aware oftlit music,bnt they still came anyway,
which is always cool.

What kind orvenues have you guys been
playing at on your tour?

Rob: It’s our second night, so both nights
were just clubs.

Mary: Typically we play a pretty wide
range of venues just to keep things inletcsk
ing and I think we've been lucky to not be too
typecast as like a certain type of band, like a
garage rock band that plays clubs every night.
or bars I guess.

We can kind offit in a variety ofsitnations
and so when we're at home we play things in
like kind of an art context like through muse-

Get some Dark Meat

Bv VICTORIA DYEDRICIIS

John Coltrane and oruette Coleman are
usually recognized for creating music towards
the end of the ‘605 that pushed jazz towards
noise at points~bur saxophonist Albert Ay-
ler went even further in the squealing, atoual
sound, towards the edge of what might rear
sonably be called music. The band Dark Meat,
which will be coming to Gardner Lounge on
Sept 22, try to push even post Ayler's sound,
and with 14 members, they might have a
chance at succeeding

Timbre, or tone quality, was the primary
focus of

work. and

Hailing from Athens, Ga., Dark Meat is tout-
ing in support ofrheir recently reissued album
Uniwrirzl Indium. The ensemble, led by Jim
MeHngh ,who sings and plays guitar, also int
cludcs three backup singers, a ﬁverpiece brass
section, and a clidgeridoo.

Some songs to look out for at the show
(or to scan the internet for beforehand) are
“Freedome Ritual,” "Well Fuck You Then,"
and “Success."

Rob: I feel like, one thing about touring is
that you have to know each particular town's
scene. Like in certain towns there might be
a club bur a lot of kids don't support the club
cause they hate it or it’s not 21 and over so
rhen either you play a house show and it'll be
awesome whereas ifyou played the club show
.no one would come and it would be terrible.

What kind
of Brooklyn
bands are you
into?

Rob:Brookr
lyn bands right
now that I re
ally like would be Crystal stilts,we just played
with them the other night in New York. Viv-
ian Girls are really good [too], and Japanther.

What kind of older bands are you listen—
ing (a? What would you say your inﬂuences
are.>

Rob: our friend used to be in Black Dice,
and I think musically they were a big inﬂuence
on me for sure.

You’ve been compared to Beat Happen-
ing. Explain how you feel about that.

Mary: We're okay with that,l mean 1 think
they have a similar kind of intention [though]
I don't know ifwe sound so much like them...

Rob: 1 think it's avihe, I think it’s the spirit
of something. I think that when we started
out we actually did consider them a pretty
strong inﬂuence because ofthe immediacy of

honest, not real hooky in general), Beginning
with an a capella solo by band member Page
