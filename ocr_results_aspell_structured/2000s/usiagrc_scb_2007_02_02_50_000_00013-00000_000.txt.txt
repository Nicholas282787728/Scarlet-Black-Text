A few weeks ago, I was discussing with a
friend the idea of writing a “How To" column’
for the SE73, Itseemcd like a great ideaiedu-
cational, humorous, and generally helpful.
Maybe my friend sensed a potential problem,
because she asked, "What would you actually
write about?"

This question turned out to be something
of a roadblock.

‘Uh oh,’l thought.

There seems to he

How not to propose adviseeship to a prof

"Adviser?" you say, “Burl don’t have an a<|~

since I dropped those four classes in the last
week of schooll" Well, never fear. Here is your

handy, pockerrs‘ized
guide to how (not)
to ask a professor to

act would be a sort of shuffling skulk, but you
would be wrong. it might seem endearing at
the time, but it’s mote likely that the profCSr
set is wondering how many bodies you have
stacked up in your closet,

3. once you've made some awkward small
talk (which shouldn’t go on too long, as the
professor will wonder why you’re in his or her
office in the first place), it's probably best to
just come out and say it. Be careful, though.

hardest steps, but
don’t worry, I believe
in you. We'll get through this together That
professor who accidentally calls you ‘doucher
bag'when calling on youPThc professoryou set
on fire last year while trying to secretly smoke
a cigarette in class? The shy math teacher you
may have accidentally propositioned wlule just
trying to compliment her blouse? Probably not
the best choices for an advisor. Choose an ad-
visor who knows you well enough to know that
you’re a decent person, but not well enough to
know aboutyour many. many emotional prob
lems

2. Once you’ve selected your future advisor,
memorized his or her schedule by heart, and
tattooed his or her name on your lower back,
it's time to make your move. You might think
that the best way to enter a future—advisor’s of-

advisor to join me on the
long, winding road of ad-
visoidom, l prefaced it by
saying, “1 feel like I’m pres
posing marriage to you."

The shy math teacher you may

or menacingly ﬂick your
lighter and whisper, “Wait

til next year...oh, you’ll see

then." sometimes things
just aren’t mcant to be, and
if your advisor is too blind

her blouse? Probably Ml the best

"psychopath" warning bells
going offin her mind as she
said, “Hahamwcll, let’s hope
not." so while in your mind, it may seem cute
to compare yourselfand your advisor to a mar-
ried couple, it actuallyjust sounds super-crazy.
Go figure.

4. When it‘s time to actually ask the guess
tiou, make sure that your professor is looking
at you and not out of the window or at some
papers. Then, when you say, “Ummmwilly-
oubemyndvisor?" in your blushing, stammering
way, they won’t have to turn around and say,
“What? Oh,you’re still here!"

5. lfyour professor accepts,you should say
thank you, brieﬂy discuss any immediate plans

(home for an adv/air

to realize that‘you’re the best
thing that ever happened to
this campus, he or she is
just not worth your time. i recommend “You
Oughta Know", a box of kleenex, and some
angry, righteous rage.

If you follow these foolproof steps and
your advisor is still ridiculously awkward, then
maybe you should reevaluate your personal
hygiene or general demeanor.

1n the end, you'll find an advisor; everyone
does. And maybe later, over coffee or brunch
or your fourteenth adviser-student anniver-
sary together, you can meet each others eyes,
think about your ﬁrst awkward encounter, and

giggle.

Econ chair continues to explain
pros and cons of tuition hike

 

from p. 9

i do not think we can raise our price with impunity. 1n fur—
ther support of the winrwm concept, the ngilltl' quotes Tony
Pals of the National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities, who says some schools have made very big tuition
increases without negative consequences. “These increases
haven’t hurt enrollment

[These institutions] do a

very good job at explain-

ing to their prospective

students why their tuition

is where it is." I don't

doubt Mr. Pals’ sincerity,

but I have two problems

with his statement. First,

enrollment is not the point. I‘m confident that we could charge
55,000 more, eliminate all ﬁnancial aid, blow up most of the
new buildings on campus, and still find 350 high school seniors
willing to enroll at Grinnell next year.

But I imagine they would be a rather motley crew. That is
to say, I would expect highei tuition to affect the quality ofthc
student body, not its , ze. Second, if as Pals says, schools can
do a good job oferplainnig to prospective students why their
tuition must be higher, why can't Grinnell do a good job of ex-
plaining to prospective students why our tuition can be lower:
In other words, why can't we say “Hey folks, were every bit as
good as Carleton, we just happen to have a lor more money."
Won’t this dispel any notion ofinfcriority? The argument that
higher tuition will raise our reputation implies that (some highly
educated) members of prospective students' families—families
that can go to Borders and find shelves full of books rating all
ofthe colleges—can somehow be fooled by a 12 percent tuition

differential. That’s a bit hard for me to swallow.

I'm tempted to speculate a bit about what I think is ”really"
going on with this tuition hike. (But first i have to double»
check something, hold on .. , OK,I do have tenuie.) Now then,
as a recent Chair of the Faculty, 1 had the pleasure ofgetting
to know many members of the Board of
Trustees. And I do mean plensurchese
are very accomplished people and their de—
votion to this college is genuinely inspiring.
From that experience I know that there is
Concern on the Board that Grinnell’s opt
crating budget relies signiﬁcantly more on
endowment income than do the budgets of
any otour peers. This exposes our opera-
tions to the vagaries of ﬁnancial markets A downturn in the
stock market could hammer our annual budget. Getting more
tuition revenue would reduce that risk and more aggressive
price discrimination may generate more revenue. 1am sympa-
thetic with this view. It is a perfectly legitimate goal, though
not necessarily one 1 want us to pursue, and ifthat is a primary
reason for the tuition hike I would like to hear someone say it
to the students. (Perhaps someone nlready'hns.)

My own preference would be to tolerate more financial risk
in the short term to enhance our academic reputation in the
long term, i believe that ultimately a college's quality is judged
primarily by the quality of its graduates. Grinnell students
aie good, and in my 17 years here, have kept getting bettei.
Therein lies the college’s “perceived quality" in the year 2027,]
think, i would prefer Grinnell to focus more keenly on getting
the best students, and I don’t think that is consistent with big
hikes in tuition.
