Freight Elevator, 929 Broad Street

The elevator is inside the building that used to be the Smith Funeral Home
and is now shared by Jacobsen stathng, Long Term Medical supply, and
stepping Stones Christian Bookstore. When the building was a funeral par
lor, the elevator was used to transport bodies to and from the embalming
room in the basement. According to Pete Guillaume, who worked in the
building during the ’805, ottentimes late in the night thc clcvator would move
on its own and footsteps could be heard on the upper levels.

The lady who led us to the elemtor left before we could begin our descent to
the depths of the old embalming basement. we were surrounded by Christ-
mas decorations being stored in the elewator, the presence of which may have
saved our lives. Regardless, the light in the rickety, cage—like elevator was bro-
ken, and the basement was pitch black. As we descended into darkness, we
heard the grinding of gears and what Johnny swears was “blood ﬂowing up-
wards" and Ali insists was just water pipes. Neither ofus was brave enough to
enter the basement. Although it is dark and cramped, the elevator would not
be ideal for heavy petting and necking~evcn if your pants are scared oir.

Witch Bridge, intersection of 2nd Ave. and the railroad tracks

One of our interviewees who knew little of Grinnell's mious specters and
ghosts did admit a shght fear of what she called the “Witch Bridge," espe-
cially at night. We visited the bridge on a sunny afternoon and were overall
underwhelmed.We did find some rusty silverware and a bowl, but these were
more likely evidence ofa hungry vagabond, rather than a bloodthirsty haunt
ing. It would be a picturesque place for mild to heavy necking and petting,
but pants would probably have to be manually removed,

Hazelwood Cemetery at Witching Hour (12:00 am.)

The most terrifying part by far is going through the front gate. once in the
graveyard we saw a distant blue light. and Johnny swore he saw a group of
people “having a very ghostly picnic" around it. Upon further inspection it
was just a small light placed near a tombstone, but lights from a neighboring
house did turn otrsuddenly as we approached the grave. lithe entrance does
not scare your pants off, strolling alone among the graves certainly will.

Hazelwood Cemetery Playground at 12:30 am.
We also checked out the abandoned playground where phantom children are
said to move the swings and merryngsround late at night. The swings and
merry-gouound did move, but no more than would have been reasonable
with the breeze. However, the sand rustlcd uncharacteristically, as if blown
by an especially strong breeze or stirred up by small root. At one point a piece
ofAli’s hair whipped her in the face harder than would have been normal for
a light breeze. Considering that it is a playground, it would be best to try and
keep your pants on, but some may find that impossible.

Remote Cornﬁeld Southeast ofGrinneIl at la.ln.
Stiff dried cornstalks have the weight or limp human appondagcs, so that
brushing through them is like wading through a sea at crackling corpses.
Plus, the sound of wind rustling the diy cornstalks is one of the ecriest
sounds you will ever hear. Not only will your pants be scared on, you’ll never
ﬁnd them.

Rumor in the Newsroom had it that the authority
on ghosts in Grinnell was a man named Josh coburn.
we met up with coburri at local tattoo parlor Slingin'
Ink in Grinnell, where he works as a body modiﬁcation
artist, with an unoFticial part-time position as a ghost
enthusiast.

Coburn, who lives in Monrezumn is an intrepid
gliostsseeker. “For me a ghostly encounter sort of has
to slap me in the face [for me] to say okay this is real,"
Coburn said. But even with his skepticism, Coburn has
otperienced more frightening encounters than the aver
age night janitor at a morgue.

Coburn first became interested in tracking ghosts
and the paranormal during a trip to tho Villisca Ax
Murder House in southern Iowa. Cobutn said he had a
lengthy encounter with the spirit of a boy who had been
murdered in a closet. “I’m such a wienet when it comes
to that stuff,” he said. "But I love it. I love being seated.”

Coburn may be Grinnell’s resident haunt expert,hut
he's not the only local who has had brushes with the
supernatural. Larry Delk, who has lived in Grinnell all
his life, had several creepy experiences while working as
a caretaker at Hazelwood Cemetery for the summer.

While mowing the grass, Delk heard a strange voice
call his name. "Plain as day my name" Delk said. "No
one was around and the mower was loud." Then once,
while working alone in the ofﬁce of the cemetery, he saw
a shadow of a man in the doorway “I thought I heard
someone walking up to the door” said Delk, but when
he looked outside no one was there. “I dwelt on it the
whole day" said Delk. “That’s why I‘m glad my job was
only seasonal."

Delk swears that there were neither drugs nor alcoV
hol involved at the times of his experiences, and that it
was not just his imagination. "I'm pretty skeptical" Delk
said “But after the experiences I've experienced . . . I’m
a believer that there are still people ﬂoating around after
death.”

Delk and Coburn believe, but we're guessing there
are still quite a few skeptics lurking among Grinnell’s
student body. Ifyou’re feeling the need to tickle your fear
bone this Halloween, here is a list ofa few local haunts,
courtesy ofCoburn, to make a believer out of you.

Stone chair, Marshalltown graveyard

For those who think they might be brave enough to
test fate, the famed death chair is awhile stonc memori-
al designed to look like wood and is found in the largest
cemetery in Matshrllllown. Legend has it that anyone
who sits in the chair will end up dying within the year. “I
sat in it in August" said Coburn,“so we'll see ifl’m dead
by next year. "

Blue Point Cemetery, between Montezuma and
Grinnell

Blue Point Coinctcty consists of two sections—an
old cemetery, and behind that an even older cemetery,
and the legend pertains to the older cemetery. Accord-

ing to Coburn, “The story goes if you [have four
people] stand in all four corners of the cemetery
and walk to the center, all tour people are supposed
to get to some center stone and it turns blue at
some time ornight and raises some spirit.”

Hazelwood Cemetery playground, Grinnell

Hazelwood cemetery is Grinncll’s main cemes
tery and the location otmany a scary night. It's said
that the spirits of the children buried in. the creme
etery play on the playground, and “if you go late at
night the swings are supposed to move themselves
and the merryrgorround is supposed to turn," Co-
burn said.

Coburn has visited the playground at night,
and while he saw the swings and merrysgo—round
move, he was more interested in the fact that when
he took pictures he saw orbs. Orbs are transparent
balls of light that sometimes show up mysteriously
in pictures and are associated with the supernatural
and thought to be spirits of the dead. "There are
two or three pictures I’ve gotten where children are
on or near the swing and a few near the merrys
go-round" Coburn saidTo get to the cemetery and
playground go west on 1st avenue, and you’ll see it
on your left.

West Field Apartments, Grinndl

Coburn’s coworker Alex Vance said he has been
having strange encounters since moving into the
apartment complex. In addition to seeing strange
shadows out of the corner of his eye, there was one
instance when Vance's television went static while
he was in a different room, “And it said hello on the
bottom ofit in weird lettering" Vance said.

“They were taller, skinnier letters—not what
myTV has . . . I’m not a big believer in that shit but
it scared the hell out of me.” Coburn stressed the
point that newer Tlejkc the one belonging to
Vancbdo not go static but blue screen. "Electrons
its at: very much considered a way to communicate
with the dead,” Coburn said.
