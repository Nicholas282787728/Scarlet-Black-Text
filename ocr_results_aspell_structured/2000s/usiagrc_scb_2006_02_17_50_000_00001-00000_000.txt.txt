Contraceptive availability issue for women

The Health Center is closed on weekends and can’t give out Plan B when many need it most

BY SARAH MIRK

Stumbling home Friday night from a Harris Party,
an unexpected and unprotected hook-up can lead to a
weekend ofanxiety.

The Health Center has often acted as the safe—
sex safety net that many students rely on, but with
no prospect ofweekend hours, the Health center the
Health Center can’t allay postehook sup feats.

For ﬁve years, the Health Centet has provided
the emergency contraceptive pill, Plan B, to female
students fearful of unwanted pregnancy. commonly
know as the “morning after pill," Plan B can be taken
up to 72 hours after unprotected sex.

But Plan B's effectiveness sharply declines after 72
hours. According to the Jacobs Institute for women’s
Health, Plan B is 95 percent effective in preventing
unwanted pregnancy if taken within the first 24 hours
after unprotected sex. After 72 hours the effective-
ness rate can drop to as low as 61 percent effective in
preventing pregnancy.

The Health Center is closed from Friday after-
noon ro Monday morning. Students have to venture
off campus to obtain Plan B when it would be most
effective, and if they choose to obtain Plan B over the
weekend, they can face obstacles of policy, distance
and cost.

Plan B is a set of two pills, each about the size ofa
conventional birth control pill. Each pill contains .75
milligrams ofa synthesized version otthe female hor-
mone progestin and must be taken 12 hours apart.

In 2003, the FDA rejected an appeal by the menus
facturcr of Plan B to change the status of the drug
from prescription only to over the counter. The pro-
posal was rejected in part because the FDA claimed
it did not have sufficient evidence that more ready
availability of Plan B would not change the sexual
behavior of adolescents, making them more likely to
practice unsafe sex.

The college has made efforts to make Plan B
available to women despite the Fons decision.

After a 2001 student initiative requested Plan

B availability at the Health Center, students had a
resource on campus for emergency contraception.
Grinnell students do not need a prescription before
obtaining the pill,Thc school has an agreement with
a local doctor. The Health Center employees fol-
low a strict protocol when distributing the pill and
in exchange, students do not have to go through the
lengthy process of seeing an offecampus doctor and
obtaining a prescription. Part of this protocol involves
signing an informed consent form, taking a preg
nancy test and promising to return for a follow-up
pregnancy test in two weeks.

When the Health Center is
open, students can take Plan B
there for only 315 n dose, one of
only two things for which the
Health Center charges students.

Female students who forget
their birth control or break their
condoms on the weekends have
three other options. They can drive
to one of the three Planned Parenthood offices in Des
Moincs and,bctwccn lo a.m. and 1 p.m.,pick up Plan
B for a price that dependant on their income level.
They can head over to the Grinncll Regional Medical
Center and obtain the pills for $100, or they can wait
until Monday morning.

“We set it up with the idea that you can gct Plan
B within the 727hour grace period. If you have uni
protected sex Friday night, you can still rake the pill
Monday morning," said Karen Cochran, director of
the Health Center.

The plan is only problematic when there is the
occasional four—day weekend, but Cochran said that
she has never heard of a Grinnell student becom-
ing pregnant because at the Health Centcr's lack of
weekend hours.

Some students feel the reduced effectiveness after
72 hours should be addressed.

“I do think something should be done to make
Plan B accessible on the weekends," wrote Feminist

Fake trials, real Nationals

Mock Trial advances one team to a national
competition in Minnesota» this Spring Break

sv DAVID MONTGOMERY

A young child has been kidnapped,
and a close family friend has been ace
cuscd of the crime. Evidence isn’t con-
clusive and the fate of that possibly
innocent friend rests in the hands of
u thrteeperson defense team, Chris
Johnston ’09, Ben Hctmg ’09 and Lau-
ra Dobbs '06 will call witnesses, grill
thcm, rile objections and make stirring
closing statements. A capricious judge
will render a decision. The courtroom
will be cleared. thcr that day the same
three students, with three others, will
return to the case again—«his time as
the prosecution.

Grinncll's Mock Trial team has
been arguing this same case ever since
late September, but last weekend they
finally got the verdict they had been
hoping for: they would be sending a
team to Nationals. Making their case

at Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., two ‘

Grinncll trial teams of thrct: witnesses
and three attorneys competed against
17 other teams. One of them placed
fourth, which advanced them to the
national competition in Minneapolis,
Minn. March 17—19.

Presenting a mock trial case requires
equal parts guts and legal knowledge,
according to team co-captain Emily
scholtcn '05. “we prepare everything
we can," she said. “Statements, direct
examinations,[crossrexaminations].On
the other hand, the witnesses aren’t set.
You have to bc on your feet for which
witness is called."

Hering agreed. “You have to have a
lot of conﬁdence," he said. “If you let
people know that something didn't go
the way you planned, you’ve already lost
the case."

The final roster for the national
tournament isn’t set because it conﬂicts
with a preescheduled Grinnell Singers
trip to Eastern Europe. Members of
the other team will fill in for missing
members.

The team didn’t expect to be in a par
sition to be sending anyone at all.They
had previously scheduled their end—of-
year banquet for yesterday, but local
attorney and team coach Brad McCall
suggested they change the date. “I told
them they‘d qualify at least one teamr
for Nationals and they’d still be practice
ing tonight," he said.

”/ do think somelh/ng should be
done [0 make Plan 5 atttssl'ble

on the weekends.”
Theresa Bruckner ’06

Action Coalition co-leacler Theresa Bruckner ’06 in
an email to the SerE,“I understand the feasibility
aspects ofir, but i think that the extra organizational
effort is worth it to make sure that people have access
to the necessary resources when they need them."

Paige Wheeler '07 also wants weekend awilabil-
ity of Plan B on campus. “As it stands, students with
Friday night trysts are in for a scary weekend and a
higher risk orunwnntcd pregnancy,“ she said in an e7
mail from abroad. Wheeler said that she has coun—
seled several of her friends about what their options
are.

“My suggestion to Grinnellians
would be to get a hold ofthe ‘morne
ing after pill' before the morning
after," Bruckner said.

Women with prescriptions can
pick up Plan B from either the
Medicap or Hy»vcc pharmacies in
town, where a dose will cost from
$30 - s45.As a national policy, the
WaleMart pharmacy does not stock Plan B.

“People who are at colleges like Grinnell where
access to Plan B is consistent and cheap might want
to think nbout getting Plan B before the are in
an emergency situation,” said Bruckner. “ Women
should] keep it in your room in case something docs
happen on a Friday night or sometime and you’re
stuck without access for a few days."

“It's just how kids use their resources,” Cochran
said, mentioning that she hosts several study breaks
during the year to inform students and SAs about
birth control options.

“if someone comes in repeatedly for Plan B, we
don’t want them to use it as their birth control, so
we will suggest other ways they can get birth cone
rtol." This was the case with a student recently who
requested Plan B from the Health Center twice in
one month. “We don’t deny service, but give them in—
formation for pills, the ring, the patch,"said Cochran
“You have to sit down and educate some people."
