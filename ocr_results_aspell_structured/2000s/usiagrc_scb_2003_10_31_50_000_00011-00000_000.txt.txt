“This is a comedy abour a rallsmg dog. nor
surreal Isl drama. We can’t take ourselves roo
seriously," said Elenavesner ‘06, who plays rlre
rlrlc role,

Sylui/r is a lamily comedy abour an upper»
middle elnss husband, Greg, played by Trevor
sedherry ‘07, and wife, Kalle, played by Ker
Henry ‘06. The couple has .usr senr rho lasr or
rhe brood olrro college and moved io uprown
Manhattan so enjoy rheir new freedom and
yumpsrarr rheir lives. While Kare's calecr sraru

rakes some rime offwork ro go ro rhe park and a
lirrlc dog named Sylvia (Yesner) iumps inro his
lap rhar he srarrs rediscovering life again Much
ro his wires chagrin, Greg hnngs rhe dog home.

“It's a very rypieal family comedy," Haile Saidr
adding, "except wlrhour kids."

Direcror Rachel Hailc ‘04 made an elforr ro
make rhe process run, Since
she was purring on rhe show

“There’s camaraderie herween rho acrors and
crew members because we‘re all a pan or

Making Sylvia humanlihe opens rhe issue of
“lhe orher woman” for Kare. Sylvia is cure,
houney and ﬂirrarions and Greg seems more
inreresred in her rhan in anyrhing else. Greg and
Kare are also aided by their Friends Tom and
Phyllis, and rheir marriage counselor Lolie, all

What Haile liked ahonr Gurney was his
suhresr, hrs ahrliry ro mix rho “scary and serious"
