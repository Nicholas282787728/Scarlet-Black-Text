she elusive “free time," In her, when asked
abous is, many ssudenrs have been known
so respond wish, "Free time? Whas's that?"
Even shough tree sirne is so rare so come
by, us imporsans so realise shas all
Grinnellians need so learn so deal wrsh is
somehow, as some pains during sheis lives.

How so seaes when tree ssme arrives:

2, Agss she sisuasion,

Keep she following questions in mind:

ally ”free sime," or just sime shas you will
inerisablyspend checking email and plans,
or playing eompuser games? And, moss

3. Make sure you're finished wish all or
your homework.

Homework is sricky, and can sneak up
on you when you leass expect is. Ifyou sud»

remember rhas you have a lo.page paper
due she day arses sornorrow, shsn whas you
have is nos really tree sime, bus prosrassie
nasion sime, Recognise she difference.

whas so do with your free sirne:

i. check email and Plans.

Unless you have sssong nilipower, or
are nos a Plans user, you’ll probably be do.
