What involves Robert

and hooking an antenna up to
the railroad tracks‘ Believe it
or- not, all these elements are
key to the story ofthe foundr
iirg of Grinnc‘lls campus tar

station manager, who related
the history of KDIC‘s begin-
nings during the political and
social unrest of the late '60s
Armr visited Grrnnell from

Years before Anni 'rived
at Grinnell, the campus had a
radio station called KGRVV,
which started in 1948 and
broadcast on AM i‘rcquency,
By 1961, its equipment was
obsolete, and students in
Norris were unable to listen
to broadcasts because the
dorms electrical wiring inter»
fered with the station‘s signal.
Students attempted to boost
the signal by illegally iltr‘rlclir
, rng wires to the railroad tracks
running through campus, but
the strategy backﬁred when
the FCC discovered that the
broadcasts eould be heard

iii St. Louis and revoked
KGRVV's licensc. KGRVV was
closed down in 1961.

In l966,altcr5ycars\villi-
out a college radio station, a
group otstudents led by Anni
decided to bring radio back to
campus, this one in FM for
mat. Aimi and his friends be-
lieved a campus radio station
was especially necessary as an
alternative forum for student
voices. “The SEiB was CdIIOT
rially more restrained or corr-
scrvative,” said Anni. “Many
oi‘ my friends didn't {col like
views on campus issues, like
women's [curfew] hours, were
being expressed."

They also wanted the

on in the world at the time,
slid Anni

When the students pros
sented their idea for KDIC,
then-President Glenn
Leggctt rejected it, citing the
college's bad experience with
KGRW and liability issues.

Aftei being turned down
by the administration, the
students deerdcd to turn to

alternate sources of funding.
They created a sospage plan
outlining their ideas and re-
quircincnts for creating the
new station, and sent it out to
so alumni with a letter asking
tor liclp funtiing the $3,000
venture.

A few months after the
letters were sent. an alumnus
responded. He said that their
proposal was ﬂawed and had
requested the wrong equip-
ment, but that he did believe
Grinnell should have a radio
station again. Soon after
ward, said Aimi, “these boxes
[of equipment] just started
showing up, and it was much
iaircicr than we had thought
of," The generous alumnus
was Robert Noyce, founder at
Intel. To Arrni’s knowledge,
this was Noycc's ﬁtsl Contrir
button to his alma mater since
he had graduated aircr nearly
being expelled for slaughter-
ing a stolen pig, Noyce would
go on to make many more
contributions to Grinnell
and have the science building
named in his honor,

Anni returned to Presir
dent Leggett‘s ofﬁce and
showed him the letter. “The
name meant nothing to me,"
Armi said, “but the president
got really interested because

apparently Noyce had been
estranged from the college."
The backing of the poweiful
alumnus was enough to make
the administration reconsider

station was given the green
light in 1967.

KDIC ﬁnally aired in
the spring or 1968. “We had

KDIC Update

5v Ivv LEE AND AMELIA Korohn

Since the beginning of the school year, students hoping
to hear the tunes of Grinnell at 88.5 PM have received only
static. Grinnell’s campus radio station, KDIC,w:is scheduled
to debut on Sept. 11, but has been delayed by the station’s
move to the new studio on the second ﬂoor of the Rosenﬁeld
Center. Delays have come in constructing the studio, mow
ing the broadcasting equipment from KDIC’s former locae
tion in Younkcr Pit and hooking up the electrical equipment.

,KDIC’s managers hope to have the station on the air as soon

as possible, but when that will be is still uncertain “Appar-
ently construction is delayed a lot more than they thought it
would be, so it's up in the air," said station manager Daniel

:Furuta’OS

Despite the technical difﬁculties, KDIC's leaders have
ambitious plans for this year’s station “‘Were hoping that
with a more visible location, both more people will listen to
us and more people will apply,” said Forum. “We also have a
new space for live broadcasts where bands can go and play
music. in the past we had no way that real people could come
in and play

There have been rumors oi KDIC being played in the
dining ball, but Furuta said the arrangement has not been
established.

Head KDIC librarian Emma Lawler '09 hopes to orga-
trim a CD check-out system for public use. “It's going to be
open to everyone, DJs and other people." she said.

Furuta hopes to assemble a more diverse set of shows this
year—an aspect that the delays in construction might actually
have helped, since applications for ms were moved back to be
due on the 18th of September instead of the let.

KDIC program director Paul warmight ’07 said that
along with basic music programs, KDIC will air several syn—
dicated political talk programs, including Free speech Radio,
a 30-minute news brief, and Alternative Radio, which airs
interviews with leftist scholars like Howard Zinn and Noam
Chomsky. He hopes this programming will encourage stur
dents to tum to KDIC not just for their friends’ music-based
shows, but for the news as well.
