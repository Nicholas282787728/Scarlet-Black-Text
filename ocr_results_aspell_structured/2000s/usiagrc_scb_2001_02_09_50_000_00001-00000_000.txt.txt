Sweatshop
decision reached

College to be part of WRC and
FLA, GCSAS objects

by Kate Mannion
Staff Writer

Several days befom winter hrcnk began, the Grinncll
College Boaid ofTrustccs decided to join both the Fair
LaborAssociation (FLA) and the Workers Rights Con-
sortium (\VRC), organizations that monitor the condi-
tions in which clothing is made. This decision follows
the Ad-Hoc Committee on Sweatshop Labor's Dec. 8
recommcndation to join both organizations.

Grinncll College Srodonrs Against Swenrshops
(GCSAS), which has deOmlcd for the college to join
rho WRC and drop membership with rhe FLA, soes
this decision as a setback. The GCSAS says that th:
FLA is not a fair orgzniution, and that it leaves room
for companies to continue with unfair labor praorieos.
Grinnell College has boon a provrsionary member or
the FLA since 1999.

Last October. the Board olTrustees rcquuted Ptcsi»
dent Osgood to assembl: the Ad-Hoc Committee on
Sweatshop Labor. Th: committee consisted of bah
Bry '04; Viyok Vcnugopal '01; Chris Hunter, Profusot
of Sociology, jack Mutti, Sidney Meyer Professor of
International Economics; Russ Allen '68,Trustcei Bob
Musscr ’62, Trustee; and John Kalkbrenncr, Dean of
Collcg: Services When askcd how he chose the comr
mittcc rnernbers. Osgood said that Bry was chosen be.
caus: ofhet involvementin ccsnsyenugopai beams:
he was SGA presidenr lasr year, Huntcr beans: ofhis
interest in social issues, Mutti because if his knowledge
of international economics and Kzikbtcnner because of
his involvcmcnt in choosing which “terns to sell in the
colicge bookstore.

Chuck Warpchoskj, president of GCSAS, said that
the committee was not chosen in an open and ran way.
“The sclcction proccss was all secret. As (h:
groop.,.worhing the most with [the sweatshop issue]
tor three years, [GCSAS] should have been involved in
the decision."

GCSAS said that the makeup ofthc committcc did
not accurately reprosonr the srodonr body, because only
two ofthe committee's seven members were students.

Bry said that sho “disagroos very strongly with rho
majority decision ofthc committee," and that the wishes
orrhesrudenr body were not gmntcd by the committee's
dccision, which ultimately became the decision of the
Board ofTrustscs Before the committcc made its rec-
ommcndntion (0 th: board. GCSAS collectcd S75 stu-
dcnt nnd 197 nonrstudentsignatums fora peririon that
called for the college to drop mornborshrp with the FLA
end to join theW'RC.

The committee met approximately four More the
Dec. 8 decision to join thc organiutions. Three of tho
committcc rnonibors were erroarnpos, so meetings in-
