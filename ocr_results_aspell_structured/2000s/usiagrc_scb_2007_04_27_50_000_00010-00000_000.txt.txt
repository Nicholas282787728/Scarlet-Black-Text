The Science of Sleep (2006)
*tttsﬁr

It’s no Eternal Sunrbine aft)» Spat/err Mimi.

But this 2006 eﬂ'ort by Smirlzine director Michel
Gondry retains the ﬂuidity of his dirccrorial skill,
rampanr with his visual creative touches. The pros
tagonist, Stephane (Gael Garcia Bernal), is returning
to Paris from Mexico at his mother’s urgings, and, in
roundabout but typical fashion, falls for Stephanie
(Charlotte Gainshriurg), the girl next door. By day, he
is slave to ajob he hates, but when he sleeps, he is the
host of“Stephane TV,"god ofhis own universe. The
plot unfolds and thickens as Stephane confuses the
actions of his dreams and translates them into reality.

Somewhat akin to .Linklatcr's work with Mkizig
Lye, Gondry takes great care ro achieve the dclicare,
almost vertiginous sensation of Stephane’s own loos—
ening grip on reality. Stephane’s dream world is truly
a beautiful thing to behold, a lovely showcase otcon»
dry's directorial talents.

However, in terms of cohesiveness and thematic
continuity, The rrirnre ifs/rep would have benefited
from having a screenwriter (especially one the cali-
ber of, say, Sunrbine writer Charlie Kaufman) The
ﬁlm has Very lirrle sense otstrucrurc: not only do rhe
scenes hlcnd Stephane’s reality and his dream world,
but the characters themselves also swrtch frequently
between English, French and Spanish. Though ap-

parently simple, the ﬁlm sprawls in a convoluted and
episodic disarray ofthe whimsical and imaginative.

The sprawl isn't bad, it’s just messy. The scenes
themselves are exquisite, and can be watched quite
comfortably one by one, rather than understood as a
unified whole.

,All in all, The science efS/ezp is a whimsical and
artfully done love story. Bemal’s comedic timing is
remarkable, and Gainsbourg more than fulfills her
role as the awkward sad-eyed heroine It is highly
entertaining, and well worth the disjointed plot.

The Last King of Scotland
tittﬁr (2006)

Ugandan dictator Idi Amin killed hundreds of
rhousands of his own people during his rule in the
705. His eccentricities, xenophobia and charisma
made him a peculiar ﬁgure to the foreign press. There
are not many actors today who can seamlessly show
both the charisma and the inhumanity ofa murder—
ous dictator, but Forest Whitaker is definitely one of
them,

Whitaker's performance in T0: Lair King of
Stat/will won him this year's Oscar for best actor in
a leading role, lrnd he deserved his award more than
many other rccent Oscar winners. Nicholas Garrigan
(James McAvoy) is the viewpoint character, a young

idealistic doctor who goes to Uganda hoping to make
a difference and instead gets swepr up into the chaotic
regime orAmin. At ﬁrst he is charmed by Amin,
then corrupted, and later horriﬁed when he realizes
the truth.

With Garrigan as the viewpoint, we are given a
western white man's perspective of Africa, much like
in The Constant Gardener. McAvoy gives all he can in

' his performance but his character is simply too reaca

tive in nature to be believed. It is obvious that his
character is a fictional construct inserted into the film
to give rhe western audience a feeling of agency.

In his ﬁrst dramatic feature, director Kevin Mac’
donald shows fantastic skill at his art, but the docur
mentary style that he honed in his awardawinning
documentary Tam/ring [be Void is still visually pal—
pahle.

Doa'r look for any deep political analysis, an ant
swer to why such dictators arise or how such state
sponsored atrocities happen; the answers aren’t there
because the questions aren’t asked. This is simply a
portrait of a madman’s regime. Graphic torture scenes
make this one not for the faint of heart, but Whitaker
will make your blood turn cold and the hair on the
back of your neck stand on end. This level of talent
makes for excellent cinema. ‘
