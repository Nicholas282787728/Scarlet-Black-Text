After finishing o 3 in the eonfeienee last year and returns
my; many star players, the Crinnell College Women's soccer
team is preparing to contend for first place in the Midwest
Conference this season, and they already have theii eyes on
the NCAA tournament.

Not only do the players believe that they earn do well,
but so do may follow supporters, “We've been told rnany
times that our team is expected to do well," said Cynthia
Dominguez '12. “The pressure motivates us."

The preseason was somewhat unusual this year, as the
team did not have any games or scrimmages with other
schools. The extra tune proved to be a good ehnnee for ad-
ditional preparation. “We had a new defense to work with,"
Ellie Deal '11 sa' t "Now we have great communication."

A recent poll ofMWC coaches predicted Carroll Cole
lege to win the conference, with crinnell picked as runner
up, and Lake Forest slotted to take third. Grinuell took two
votes for first and is considered a strong contender for the
conference title.

Currently the team has a record of 2-1, after beating
Cornell (5-0) and Coe (4,1) with Miki Nakamura ’10 scorr
ing a total of three goals in those efforts. Their only loss
earne to Loras College, where they were shut our 2-0. “[The
loss] exposed some Weaknesses," said Head Coach Heather
Benning. “And showed us where we need to improve."With
games against perennial rivals Carroll, Lake Forest, and St,
Norbert approaching quickly, the women hope to work out
any kinks in their play.

Deal cites the size and strength ofthe team's non-starters
as a unique advantage of Grinnell. "We have a lot of depth
this year," Deal said. “It means that we have a lot of 013*
tions.”

Grinnell women's soccer has always prided itself on a
strong team ethic that relies on all its players,which it hopes
will propel it to the top or the conference this year. “Our
team has consistently had a good team dynamic," said Benr
ning. “We always want to make sure that we work as a coher
sive group instead offour distinct classes."
