Downtown on Broad and Main Streets,
rhespectively, Grinnells longtime coffeehouses
have been preparing pastries and pouring cofr
fee as long as current students have been on
campus.

Grinnell Coffee Company

Looking out on Broad Street from the
front window stands an impressive, shiny
hot-air coffee roaster. On some days, Garrett
Roche, donning black duds that lit the décor,
stands behind it, When Roche started the
Coffee Company about four years ago, this
shiny contraption cost him about $15,000, but
it allows him to roast all of his coffee himself
rather than buy it prepackaged.

“Havnig fresh coffee from the roaster is
Like getting fresh bread from the baker',"_ Roche
said. “After three or four days the coffee really
starts to lose its ﬂavor."

Every few days, small batches of raw beans
are aimed from lightrtan to dccprbrown in
the machine, The beans come from about a
dozen countries and sit in loo-plus pound
burlap bags in the back room. Like at Saint's
Rest, some are organic or fairctrade,

The machine stopped, Roche shook a
couple oflevers, and the dark beans whooshed
back into a big glass container to cool.

He took another container labeled“Colum-
bia” offthe windowsill and dumped the coffee
beans into a funnel at the top of the machine.

panel, and the thing was buzz-
ing and churning again. Hot air
billowed through the beans in a
constant little eruption.

Despite the fascinating ma—
chine, Roche peddles more than
joe. “We have caffeine, but we
also have smoothies and beer,”
said barista Serge Giachetti '06,
“and the sandwiches are really
good."

Giachetti and Rachel Nlillet
'05, although both employees of
the Coffee Company, still have .
a soft spot for both shops.

“1 like Saint’s Rest and I
go there,” Miller said. “I think
they've worked out their nich-

niche is the quality and selec—
tion of its drinks—brown, am-
bcr and otherwlsc—thcn the
draw at Saint's Rest is perhaps
its homeynoss. Sure, there’s coffee and tea, but
the rolls are mouthwatering and the atmo-
sphere is friendly.

Saint’s Rest

It’s hard to miss JeffPhelps'73 ponyrtailed
head smiling at visitors from the menu board
above the counter.

Born and raised in Grinnell and a college
alttm, Phelps has both a bit of
Col, Sanders’ hometown goods
ness and Ben and Jerry's hip
social consciousness. on any

. given day, the customers are a
melting pot, too.

“It‘sjust fun for me to watch
the whole Grinnell commu»
nity mix,” said Phelps. “One
of my main goals was to make
the community a community
again,”

As opposed to the more
subdued inside of the Coffee
Company, Saint's Rest tends
to be somewhat more bustling,
talkative and light.

"I like coming in here on
weekend mornings because

people and babies; it makes me happy," said
Laura Marx ’07, leading back in her wooden
chair, book in hand. “And the baked goods are
yummy"

The pastries at Saint's Rest are something
special. They reside in a non-descript cabinet
near the back, but if the quadrilateral handles
don't catch your eye, a squishy, sugarrsoaked
pecan roll will.

Between three different cooks, the shop
is daily supplied with a smorgasbord ranging
from brownies to biscotti.

respectable music selection during the day, or
come at the right time and catch live music,
including the monthly appearance of the Too
Many Strings Band, appeared this Wednes-
day.

The folk ensemble, which features several
professors, has played in the cramped area near
the front door since the store’s opening seven
years ago. con Brio, the c-Tones and many
nonrcollcgc groups have pcrfornicd tltcre r00,

Still, it’s the wee hours ofthe morning that
get Phelps most jived.

“I get up at 4:30 a.m., open up at 5:30 a.m.
and people start rolling in here the minute
I unlock it," Phelps said. “In the mornings,
there’ll be conversations that fly from one corn
nei [ofthe room] to the other. What more can
I ask for?”

button

7:40 am. OK, really now, rise and shine!

7:59:47 a.m.1 arrive at Ancient Greek His-
tory Class a bit early. I steal a few‘Z's.

8:00 am. We learn about the homosexual
tendencies of Ancient Greek men. Hey,
that’s not all we discuss in that class. Itjust
so happens that that was the main topic du
jour, On Wednesdays.

9:00 a.m. Directing class! We begin by grip:
ing about how all of our actors either have
newly announced, uncmissable work shifts,
oi- mono. 0t both, This segues nicely into
Chris Connelly’s numerous stories about
Red Deer/r (which can be seen
this wee send and this weekend onlyl).

11:00 am. Luncheon!
leftover meatloaf . ..

as a nifty“Random Rant."

5:00 p.m. I plan to watch a ﬁlm entitled
Camila, but as this is speculation from
here on out, I would say that the use of the
I-leimlich maneuver could possibly pop up.

7:00 pm. supperl OK, here the Heimljch
maneuver could easily come in handy

8:00pm.. Rehearsal! For N/mmi in [Ire
I.‘ Wing Ram, in ﬁne play with ﬁne acting
talent.

10:30 pm By now 1 have probably used
the Heimllch maneuver half a dozen times.
Sometimes on people who are just scratch-
ing their neck, The International Choking
Sign can never be too loosely interpreted,I
always say.
