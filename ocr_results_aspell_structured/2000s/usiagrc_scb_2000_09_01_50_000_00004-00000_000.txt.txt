As Arts arid
Entertainment Editor,
I am free to allot print
space to anyone I
deem worthy. With
this in mind, I would
like to introduce my
new weekly column,
"Au Fait". Its Contents
will not only be self-
indulgent, but also
completely useless to
the reader. For those
of you who don’t
know, "Au Fait“ means
something in French.

Oscar Wilde once
wrote, "All art is quite
useless.“ And with
the probable exception
of the useful and
dynamic box ran, I
believe he was right.

For evidence in
support of this theory,
one does riot need to
look further than the
sculptures on campus.
While I have seen
students do things to
the Zirkle other than
admire it, this example
of art does not fall
under the technical
deﬁnition or practical
(practical — contain-
ing one or more
functioning cup
holders).

But no matter how
useless art is, it does
tend to be entertain-
ing (1 again direct you
to the example of the
Zirkle). So entertain-
ing, in fact, that an
entire section of the
newspaper is dedir
cated to it. This
section of the paper
covers books, music,
movies, plays, and
exhibits, among other
things. However, in
the past, some bits of
arts and entertainment
news havenot made it
into print. This is
because they are
either too esoteric or
too short to be
covered in a com
pletely serious, full-
length article.

These pieces of
information, ignored
by other journalists in
the past (for veny valid
reasons) now have a
home here. I encour—
age you, the reader, to
alert me via email to
any happenings in
grinnell that should he
covered in my column.

Also, if anyone one
knows what the name
of my column means, I
would be interested in
that information as
well.
