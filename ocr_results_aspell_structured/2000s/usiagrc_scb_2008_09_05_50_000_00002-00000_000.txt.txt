Registration Changes bring smiles

First—year class avoids long lines in Harris and tears

BV SARAH ERVIN

As first-years saw their class schedules for the first time at
2 p.m. On Tuesday, Aug. 26, the usual panic oflong lines, full
classes and stressful schedules was notices
ably absent.The relative calm came with this
year's revamping of Grinnell's Oftrcriticrzcd
fusryem‘ registration,

In previous years, new students were ran—
domly placed in ten different groups and
then sent into the Harris Center one group
at a time Once inside, students vied for spots
as they quickly filled, slightly similar to this
year's add/drop session.

In the old process, students choosing in later groups had
fewer options than those in earlier groups, according to Regis—
rrnr Cheryl Clinse. “Advisors felt that students in groups eight,
nine, and ten were having problems," she
said, “We had students that were almost sobe
bing in the hall. We didn't want to see that
repeated."

During fustryeai registration last year,
many students found that they could only get
on the waiting lists of their preferred classes.
JeffLeep '11 could not register for any otthc ,,
classes he had presselectcd. “It sucked her One.
cause i was in group tent had to rush around
and find classes that were still open," he said,

“It was really frantic."

This year, instead ntrcgrstering for classes
all at once in randomly ordered groups, in»
coming ﬁi‘SITyeili’S went through a registration process similar
to that of other class years. RISKT)’CM‘S filled out a presrcgisV
tration form that was given directly to the Registrar’s Ofﬁce,

”We’re evaluating the numbers
now, but we think that over 90
percent of the freshmen got the
course they wanted in round

and these were then randomly frlrcrcd into three groups. A

student who had the worst draw number for their firstschoice

class would have the best draw number for round two. Round
three was randomized once again,

Students who were dissatisfied With

their schedule had the option of going to
an add/drop session at Harris, which was
the same process as initial registration in
previous years, According to Chase, out of
468 ﬁrsvycars, only 63 attended the substk
oucnr add/drop session.

After completing the new process,
which she said was not particularly stressful, Frances Both—
fcld '12 said she was placed in all of her first—choice classes. “It
wasn't stressful because it was out ofmy hands once I turned in
[the presregistration torin]," she said,

Some new students, however, were not
so lucky. While Cory Keeler '12 got one of
her AISITCliOlCC classes, she said she found
the whole process to be “really frustrating,"
she said the Harris add/drop session was in,
tiinidatrng and difficult to navigate.

According ro Chase, even though the
results were not flawless, ﬁrstryenrs gener»
ally got into the classes they wanted. “We're
evaluating the numbers now, but we think
that over 90 percent of freshmen got the
course they wanted in round one," she said.

Unlike last year, Chase said, the reaction
to the new system has been positive and the
registrar's offrct iras received no complaints. “At some pointl
hope we can improve it even more, but it takes time,"shc said,
