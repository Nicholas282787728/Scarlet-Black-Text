The unknown lolcats man: Wayne Twitchell

E\ MATT ZMUDKA

Chances are good that most Grinncllians
have not lnet Wayne Twitchell, but they have
probably used his course tools, taken his polls
and laughed (or groaned) at his pictures of
amusing nniintls.

Twitchell is the Applientions Iiitcgmtor/
Developer for Grinncll, or better known as the
“God ofPioneerwcb."Twltchell is devoted to
his job ovcrsccing Pioneerweb but his person-
illitv' is also deﬁned by a love for science ﬁction
and a soft spot for silly cats.

Twitchell has been with the college since
1998 and, like a good father, has cared for
Pioneerweb, an adaptation of the commerr
cial Blackboard platfolm, from its inception.
"I came as a technologist to help people work
in the classroom, have reelinology that was
cool nnd support teaching and learning," suid
Twitchell.

In his poo on, Twitchell researches new
technology, develops modules for classes and
organizations to use and ensures that the
school's technology stays online, “I really ran
all ike to do the back end stuff,"he said, den
scribing the obscurity of his role on compus.
He adds that, up until recently, Pioneerweb
has “ﬂown under the radar,” and this allowed
him to develop social tools to make the plat-
form more interesting, “We just put some bits
out there that were a little more fun, a little
lighter," he said.

Twitchell was worried some of his addi-
tions would be too controversial. “The Profese
sot Qiotes were something I thought for sure I
would be told no. The professors have actually
been very good,"Twitchell said. “I think now
faculty have started proactively telling students

Campus polls are another atldlilonTWltCl’l’
all added just for fun. “We get a bunch of
people telling us whether they're rights or lefte
handed, bllt I don’t know ifthat translates into
actual useﬁil usage,” he said.

Twirehell's most unique contribution may
be his use of pietures of funny nnimttls, spee
ciﬁcnllylolcats, in banners alerting PWeb users
to important information, Twitchell say this
as a way to stay connected to students while
also making it harder to ignole important in—
formation. “1 think this is the last chance to
understand pop eultute I will have ofwhat
the kids ﬁnd cool, and lolcats are clearly not
that either," he said. “A picture ofa cute anilnal
at least makes you stop for a second and go.
what's the big giant banner that I’m going to
ignore anyway?”

With the cute animals,Twitchcll hopes to
provide students with the comfort and guide
once he had while growing up.“1'rn from the
Sesame Street generation, and puppets were
always the moral compass of my life, and lolr
cats seem to be that way too,”Twitchell said.

There’s much more to Twitchell than the
lolcats, however. Growing up in Lansing,
Michigan, he began his education at Michi-
gan Tech for engineering but later transferred
to Central Michigan to get his bachelor’s in
biology and chemistry education. From there,
he eventually received a PhD. n neuroscience
from Purdue, hut “in the beglnning orthe Inr
ternet, I found out I really loved doing web
stuff way more than 1 did doing research."

Each day, Twitchell commutes to Grinnell
90 minutes each way from Cedar Falls, Iowa,

Throughout the interview, Twitchell kept
pulling the conversation back to Pioneerweb
— extolling the virtues of its reliability and
gushing about new modules 7 and it ms
easy to tell that he truly enjoys his work at
Grinnell. “I've got one the best jobs on cam»
