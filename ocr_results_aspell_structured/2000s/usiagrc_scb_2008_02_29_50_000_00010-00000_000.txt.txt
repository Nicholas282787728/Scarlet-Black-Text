You can ’t go home again?
805 and 905 alums return

Many former Grinnell students come back to their alma mater— who knew so many of them came
from the time when e- mail was new, Iraq was a winning war and Nirvana was the ybrand new thing?

By HARsHA SEKAR ANDJIM MALEWITZ
For most students, college graduation de—
notes the end of one experience and the op
portuniry to embark upon a completely new
journey in a new setting. But for many cur
rent Grinnell faculty and administrators, come
menccment was not their final goodbye to
Grinncll, IA. After doling out thousands of
dollars in tuition, 16 alumni from the late 80s
and early 90s can now even the score, gracing
the college payroll. Looking back on their cxr
perienccs, the alumni note how returning to
Grinnell has changed and shaped their relae
tionships with each other, their professors and
the school itself. .
, Despite Grinnell’s small student body both
then and now, many members of this group
did not know each other well as students, “1

knew of a lot of these people but didnr have
many close relationships within the group,"
said Henry Rietz’89, Religious studies.
Director of Social Commitment Doug
Cutchins ’93 agreed, listing Reitz, Sarah Put»

Joyce Stern '91. and Director of
Conference Relations Rachel
Bly 93 as a few people with

But within this group of
1lumni. there were a few solid
friendships such as between Ely
and Purcell, who still rctain it
close relationship

Spccial Assistant to the ,
President for Diversiry and
Achievement Elena Bernal ’94
also mentioned Ely as a good
acquaintance while both were snidenrs, and
now, as colleagues, the two occasionally meet
for lunch. According to Bernal, she gets a
“warm fuzzy feeling" when around Bly and
other faculty with thc same Grinncll-inﬂuv
cnccd mindset, This connec-
tion, she said “makes it easy to
stay on the same page."

Bernal’s return to Grinncll
has been particularly unique
among the group oralumni, As
a student, she was a spokesper-
son for SOL and an outspoken
advocate for social justice on

campus. “It's runny that some- lstory

one like me,who so was involved

in so many ﬁghts with administration, is now
a part of this very institution," She said, remi—
niscing about the shouting matches she had
with former Vicerl’rcsidcnt of Student Affairs
Tom Crady as a first year.

During her senior year however, Bernal's
negotiations became more affable, and she said
that Crady eventually “became my mentor."
While first sitting down with Crady as .1 col-
league “everything came full circle," she said.

Many alumni found similar familiar faces
when they returned. Cutcllins said that many
ofhis flworite professors such as Marci Sottort
History, Bob Grey, Political Science, and Vice
toria Brown, History are still teaching While

as late as 1993, apparent Glinnell mainstays
such as 10/10 and Block Parry had yet to be

Henry Reitz ’89

spent the last day of spring finals week outside
on High Street, there were also a few early 90s
traditions which have since died out. such as
an allrcampus scream during finals week and
an annual pig roast

Perhaps one of the bio ggest changes to hit

campus since the early 90s
is rhc pronuncncc of crmail.
While most students take 6-
mail {or granted now, Bcrnal
talked about the excitement
it created when introduced
'in its initial form as A means
of communication only he-
twecn those on camp To
us, it was the coolest r mg,"
she said, “It was a lot like
Plans. Sometimes we would
send messages back and
torth just for run and as a
means of procrastination."

Another major difference during this era
was that Hartis Center had not been built.
This meant that not only had “Harris l-look-
ups" yet to reach campus parlance, but also that
dorms played an increased
role in socializing. “I liked
just hanging out with peo—
ple in the residence halls
and I really loved the goofy
things we did," said Stern,
describing one concept to
which current Grinnellians

. can certainly relate.

H So what is it that has
drawn so many alumni from
this on back to their alma mater? VVhlle few
could pinpoint a specific explanation beyond
the general characteristics that make Grinnell
an appealing place to work, Reitz gave it the
old college try. 1 think its just the serendipity
of this piacc, he said. it seems like strange
things like this just happen here."
