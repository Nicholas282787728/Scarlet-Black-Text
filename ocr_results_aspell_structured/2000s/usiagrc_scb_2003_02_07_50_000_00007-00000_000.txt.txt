Lasr semssrers shows were roeorded live ar rhe 1(ch srudio. “1r

several mysreries lasr semesrer and will eonrinue aering rhis semesrer.

This seinesrer’s firsrshoiv may be a rerun from lasrsemesrer. Seriprs

Mysrery suspense Thearre also performed an adaprarion of
Dashioll Hammerr’s “The House on Turk Srreer" and episodes from
The Adveurures of Harry Nile "Harry Nile is a looal show from
searrle, and it’s full ofderails speeihe ro Seattle," said Cole. “I ger
homesiek lisrening ro it.”

Cole fii-sr lisreriod ro radio rhearre as a kid. and sees his show as a
way re diversify rhe KDIC armosphsre. “It’s a whole lor offun, and
it’s somerhing rhar 1 know hasn't been done or Grlnncll for ar leasr
ﬁve years," he said.

The aerors \vill reeord on up to rhree or four microphones. Then
audio engineer Aaron Virslsnp '03 will rake rlie dlgiml audio rapes
and mix rhem onro one rraek wirh sound effeers and music in rhe
eleerionie inns-is his. He ran also disroir rhespeed, volume and srarie

he said

don't have a lor prosperienee wirh voiee," ho said. “Most ofmy expe-
rienre is wrrh unoie. I'm hoping we tome our with some shows rhar

Eaeh original resording will be 30.45 minnres long, so Cole will
ﬁll rhe res. ofrhe airrime wirh rransirions and vinrage shows. He will
also add “bumpers," or inrerruprions for announeemems and adver-

Bob’s has sponsored rlie radao rhearre show borh semesters, “we're
trying ro ger sponsorships from local businesses," said Blur“. “It gives
us money ro run rheshow, and ir incruses awareness ofrhe show. we

Henry is rhe direerorofrhis semesrer's fiisr
show, “The Laughrer of rho Gods," an early»
woos play by rhe Earl of Dunsany "its a
moekery ofcreek eagerly," said Henry “It's
an explanarion of why we no longe. have
prophers, and how humans manipulared rhe
will ofrhe gods.”

“It’s niee nor ro have re look as differenr
aspeers, sueh as physical aspeers," said Henry.
“I feel like i. an be a lor berrer beeause we
only fosus on one aspeer." ln a “eampy” seripr like “laughrer of rho
Gods,” Henry sees this as an advanrage. “Ifd-ic ehamerers were really
complex. ir would be annoying'to have yusr sound "

“The mos. imporranr thing is

rhearre, aerors and direerors

also have ro be oireful ro avoid pauses and make sure voiees are easily
drsringuishable.

Unlike mosr or she shows, whieh fearure rhree or four aerors,
Henry direers a ms. of 12. She plans ro run rehearsals wirh main
aerors, and rhen run several full-length rehearsals before rhe February
is recording dare. “I'm kind ofnervous," she said, “beeause l’ve never
direered a full-length play before."

The amounr ofrehearsal rime will vary wirh rhe demands ofeaeh
directory explained Cole. For example, Erner Grifﬁn ’05 will prob»
ably begin rehearsing her Beckett pieee for a monrh and a halfbefore
resording. Orher direerers inelude Jeremy Rlodgerr '03 and Nick
Wagner '025.

Cole hopes ro arrraer some rampus bands onro rhe show. as well
as hosr Riralin Tesr squad again rhis semesrer, possibly as a show
