Four Younker student staff dismissed since start of year

When Younker residents moved in this past August, they
were introduced to the Sinounker student staff, including six
Younker 8A5 and an HSC.

By February, three SAs and the HSC were gone, rcmovcd
from their positions and in two cases moved to rooms- c158,
where on campus.The SAs were Merritt Duncan '08,Amanda
Bayliss '07 and Nick West '08. Lina Rodriguez ’08 was the
Smounker HSC. Only one of the four SAs has been replaced
and Rodriguez's lounge reservation duties have been taken over
by Smounker RLC Laura Connors.

Student staff at Grinnell operate under tight niles of ano-
nymity and none of the snidents involved were willing to talk
openly about their dismissal. Connors referred questions to
Tom Crady, vice president for Student Serviceswho declined
to comment.

in early September, Duncan was dismissed. “I could un.
derstand why they did it," she said, “but I was still upset about
the way they went about it,” Duncan said that a week after the
incident in question she was brought into Student Affairs and
told that she was dismissed.

“I was given no opportunity to plead my case and was told
to move in three days," said Duncan,who moved into Norris.

Bayliss was dismissed in November. West said that Bayl-
iss was not “given a significant chance to defend her position."
Bayliss was allowed to remain in Younker,

achieve, and also aware of the progress we make and the things
that aren't working out well," he said. “1 expect to get criticized
for probably a ton of things, but that's fine and I’d be happy
with it as long as the student body understands what's going
on around campus."

Hall is also President orowa College Democrats and pars
ticipates in intramural sports. Billups is on Judicial Council,
Debate Team and Mock Trial and has a KDIC show called

Billup s and Downs with which he spreads his “moderate pres
paganda." Both Hall and Billups are Political science majors
with political aspirations beyond Grinnell College.

Hall, Billups, and both oftheir opponents in the run-offat-
tended the Grinnell-in-London program last semester.

Rodriguez was told of her dismissal over winter break, but
didn’t find out until several weeks into the semester that she
would have in move.

“I was prepared to move in the first vveckwhcn all 1 had was
a bit of reading," said Rodriguez, who remained after appeal.

West was dismissed following an incident on January 28.
He said that he was given a chance to appeal, which he lost.

West and Duncan said that it was no coincidence that all
four dismissed student staﬁ’were from the same dorm. Both
cited difficulties with Conners, the RLC.

“The RLC is, in my opinion, supposed to be an advocate
for his or her staff and community," said West. “I think that
[Conncrs] had blatant disregard for the health of either."

Rodriguez felt that the criticism of Conners was unwar-
ranted. “i feel Like people have been quick to blame Laura, and
I’m not sure that’s fair,“ Rodriguez said. “All ofmy interactions
with Laura have been very positive and she's been very sups
portive ofme."

Couriers told the Smounker student staff that she will not
be returning as an RLC next year.

The four incidents over the course of this year have prompts
ed Sheree Andrews, the director of Residence Life, to reform
many ofthe policies that the dismissed SAs have criticized.

Ask the President-

 

 

 

What was the most important thing to
come out of this most recent trustee yis»
it? What are your biggest concerns about
the most recent meeting? What should
students be most concerned about?

The Trustees voted to renovate Cowles dining area to be
alternative style student housing. This was the biggest action.
I also think they were very pleased to be able to name Ker-
shaw Hall for our ﬁrst African-American graduate. 1 really
didn’t have any signiﬁcant concerns and don’t see any for sure
dents either but you might ask the SGA leaders who partiti-
pated fully.
