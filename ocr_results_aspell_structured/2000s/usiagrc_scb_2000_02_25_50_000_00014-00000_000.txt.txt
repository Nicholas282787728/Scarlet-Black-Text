MSIR short-course offerings are getting short- -changed

By Hudson Heatley
Staff Columnist

Upon opening the orange flyer
that appeared in my mailbox late last
semester, I should have been ecstatic
to find an alternative short course
offering from the music department
for “Black Music and the Spoken
Word", taught by visiting minority
scholar Dawn Norfleet.
major, and I would jump at the
chance to access a part of musical
culture not typically available at
Grinnell.

However, the orange flyer, put
out by the Minority Scholarsnlne
Residence (MSIR) Program, ap
peared long after pre»tegi‘stration
deadlines had come and gone; so,
instead of a refreshing opportunity
to broaden my cultural and musical
understanding, I was left with a full
course load and no room to add the

course consists of only three weeks
ofclasses and two credits, the pros»

even touched upon in our current
curriculum makes these collrse very

sign up for the course, others had ale
ready ﬂooded his office with requests
and I was put on a waiting list.

Familiar story, I know. We've all
been closed out of classes; we’ve all
been put on waiting lists for rhc
popular ones. Some ofus have even
felt that we were more qualiﬁed than
others to take the course In terms of
our majors and concentration, or at
least in terms of our personal pas»
sion for the topics at hand. All of
these typical scenarios thwarted my
process ofgetting into this particu-
lar course, but what concerns me
more is nor my own frustration with
the pre-registration process, but the
fact that the MSIR course offerings
are not given the same mitmlweight
and importance as Others amid the
whole mess ofregisttation.

Yes, it is a familiar story: these
offerings arrive on the coattails of
the course book [wry year. If the
MSIR short course announcements
arrive after the hellish process ofget-
ting your liberal arts requirements in

order, what kind of message is our
school sending about truly wanting
us to invest our time and energy in
these courses? For many students,
the late arrival of the offerings
(among other things) makes them
virtually inaccessible; because ofthis
fact, a subliminal message is sent out
to the Grinnell community that rnI»
notity culture, scholarship, and is»
sues are inherently subordinate to
the test ofout educational priorities
here at Grinnell

My values run contrudictory to
such a message, and I would like to
trust that this shortcoming of the
short course program tubs you thc
wrong way as well.

The powers-that»be are appar-
ently looking into the problem and
are aware that some revamping ofthe
program needs to occur, and I would
fervently agree, except that at this
point, I’m sick of trying to estimate
what the process of “looking into
things” entails and exactly how long
it takes before we get our priorities
in order, and, more importantly, if
our priorities as Grinnell students
are even being represented and
implemented in the administrative
arena.

Not only are these Course offere
ings little afterthoughts of our cel-
ebrated curriculum, but they are
thtee-week»long, or at best semester-
long, teases that carry little credit
and little promise to the minority
scholars of furthering their career

George W. Bush has done
an excellent iob in this campaign
of setting the Republican record
straight about tax cuts. During the
1980 campaign, it was what We
father called “voodoo economics”
that provided thc justification for
a policy In which tax cuts were of-
fcrcd to rhc rich in an effort to help
an economy struggling under the
wcighr ofwhat amounted to in oil
embargo by OPEC and the gen»
ctal lack ofconsumption by Ameri-
cans. The Laffer Curve provided a
justification for cutting the high-
est marginal income taxrate: byar»
gurng that thc richcsr Amcricans
would be more likely to invest if
rhcy had more money in their bank
accounts. So in thc early 1980’s, the
Democratic Congress cut marginal
tax rates and took credit when Paul
Voelltcr and the Federal Open
Markets Commission set the
economy back on sound groundr
Interestingly, the Reagan—Congress
cabal did not take creditwhen their
deregulation of the savings and

loan industry helped 2 few rich
Americans (includingWs brother,
Neil Bush) to defraud the Ameri—
can people ofscvcral billion dollars.
That, however, should not be sur»
prising.

In 2000, the American
economy is in the midst ofthe long
est period ofsustnincd growth in its
history. The full employment rate
of unemployment has been sure
passed, and its now a worker’s mar-
kct. In aquicksttoll through downn

ofhclp wanted signs. Basically, were
in tip—top shapc economically, rt

dation ofquicksand.

So the logical question bccomcs
this: ifRepublicans believe that tax
cuts for the rich stimulate the
cconomy, why do we need to cut
taxes at a time when thu Fed is
working to consrricr, not to enlarge,
rheAmerican economy? It’s simple.
Ifthe Laffet curve and supplycsidc
economics don't providc the Re-
publicans with the rationale they
need to cut taxes fortheir campaign

donors, they hnve to ﬁnd another
reason.

Suddenly, trxcs should not be

GOP establishment, ofwhichWis

taxes on the rich to bc lint to work-
