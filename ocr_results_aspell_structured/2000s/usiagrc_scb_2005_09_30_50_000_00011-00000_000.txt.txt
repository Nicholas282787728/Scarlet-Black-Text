The women's soccer ream continues to shur down the comparis
tion in their charge towards the Midwest Conference Title.The last
three conference teams that have played against the Pioneers have
been unable to put any points on the board.

The soccer rcam has had a spccracular season so far, firmly scs
curing their place at the head ofthe pack in the Midwest Confer
ence and hvrng up to the high expectations set by the coaches poll at
the beginning ofthc year.

The Pionccrs travclcd to Wisconsin last Saturday to play against
Beloit College. Grinnell defeated the Buccaneers 570. The Pioneers
did an cxcellcntjob of controlling the ball throughout the game and
ﬁve different Pioneers found the back of the not during the match.

on Tuesday, the soccer team hosted the Knox College Prairie
Fire but they were anything but hospitable. The Pioneers soundly
defeated Knox, sending them home after a 16-0 hlowour.

The women have ﬁve wins, two losses and a tie so far, but they
are undefeated in their conference. The Pioneers currently have a
record of 4-0 in the MWC, with five conference games lcft in the

Pioneers lose but have a great weekend

av EMANUEL ANDRAS

There was no luck of the draw for the women's
tennis [cam last week at the Intercollegiate Tennis
Associarion Midwest Region Championships. Two
of Grinnell’s singles players drew opponents seeded
in the top ﬁve at the tournament for their first round
matches.

Despite some tough losses the women had a good
time and performed well against the competition,
pulling offa few upscrs in both singles and douhlcs
matches during the championships. .

The regional, held at Gustavus Adolphus College
in Minnesota, brought together more than sixty ofthc
top singles and doubles players in the Midwesrwuh
so many players competing, the ITA Regional is one
of thc roughest women's rcnnis tournaments during
the fall season. The rcgionnls are considerably more
difficult than the Midwest Conference tournaments.

“Every match won against opponents at this tour—
namcnr is quite an accomplishmcnr," said Coach
Barbara Waite, “But, win or losc, if Grinnell players
see that they can hit well with these pl: yers,'that’s a
success too.”

The Pioneers had more losses than Wins at the
end of the regional, but this was partly a result of their
particularly tough opponents. Rachel Engh ’08 drew
the ﬁrst sccdcd player in rhe cnrirc rouruamenr for
her opponent. Engh received a hyc in the ﬁrsr round,
but lost her first match later in the day. Maya Lipert
’09 faccd the fifth sccdcd player at the tournament
and lost in the ﬁrst round as well.

One of the most impressive performances cam
from second~ycar Camilla Alarcon, who had a bril-
liant first round victory against an opponent from
the Universnry ofWisconsinsEau Claire. Alarcon was
defeated in the second round against a seeded player
from Coe, who was also the state high school cham-
pion oflowa lasr year.

“All three demonstrated an ability to win games
from top players and play long, hard-fought points,"
said While.

GustavutrAdolphus also ran the Gustavus lnvis
tational Tournament for players who were not comr
penng in the ITA Regional. The women performed
much better at the Gustavus Invitational.

Liperr and Kati: Colver ’09 made it to the semis
finals, defeating a top—ranked Gustavus team in the
quarrcrﬁuals hcfcrc ending their run.

“Katie and Maya played incredible douhles," said
Engh. “They were beasts,"

on the singles side, Culver, Margaret Block ’08
and Jocelyn Ncwhousc ’08 all managed to advance to
the second round. Laura Burton '08 advanced to the
third round before being defeated, Burton reached
the quarter—finals of the consolation bracket. ,

“All in all, this rournamcnrwas a great experience-
buildcr and a lot offun," said VVnitc.

The players were also very pleased with their per
formance at the rcgionals.

“Overall it was a great weekend,” said Block.
“Tenmcd up against those top players, I'm really proud
of the team’s accomplishments."

Record breaking weekend for cross country

BY AMELIA KOFORD

A horde of Grinnellinns stormed a small island on the Missis-
stppi last Friday accompanied by a small army or more than 300
runners from over 30 different schools,

The lunncrs were on Credit Island In IlljnOls for the annual
Brissrnan-Lundecn Invitational, hosted by Augustana College.

The men's and women's cross country tcdms rau circles around
the island and the competition, ﬁnishing in oath and fifth place
respectively out of more than 25 schools. The cross Country teams
broke 28 of Grinnell’s all-time fastest 6K and 8K times at the
met. -

Despite being without its rop runner, Sarah Spencer '03, rhc
Grinnell womcn’s cross countly team ran 19 of the 50 fastest 61(‘s
in Grinnell history. Spcnccr did not run in the meet due to an mgr
gravntcd rcndon in her right foot, hut she will be back in full rorcc
for the team‘s next meet arwarrhurg next week.

“We missed her and it was disappointing not to have her," said
women's coach Evelyn Frccman. Freeman was happy with the deci-
sion to give Spencer rim to recover. “We're still an awcsomc rcam
even if she can’t run," said Freeman, “and we showed that on Ftir
day" »

Thc Grinnell worncn scored 168 polnrs to take fifth place out of
27 teams. Olivct Nazarene College took first place with 60 points.
The rop ﬁve women’s runners finished within only 55 seconds of
each other.

Katie Ryan 07% 22:22 set a schoolsrccord and put her in 10th
place overall. She was followed by fellow juniors Erin Booth in 28th
place with a time cf22:55 and sara Brady in mm place with a time
of23: . Meredith Groves ’08 took 43rd place with a time of23:14
and Erin Sindcwald ’08 ﬁnished 49th with a 23:17 to round out the
top ﬁve women runncrs for Grinnell.

Grinnell runners traditionally look forward to the Augusraua

 

 

mccr becausc the course is vcry ﬂat and it yields fast times. With
a total of 334 runners, it is also one of the largest invitational: [l‘ml
Grinnell participates in every year. Additionally, “Auwic is just a
great race because it's on a Friday, so you have Saturday and Sunday
to do work and rclax,” said Booth.

The men's rcaru also put up a good performance, earning sixth
place out of 32 teams with a total score of 152 points. Augusrana
won its home meet with 59 points.

Dave Honig ’05 took second place with a time of 24:26, breaks
mg the covered 25 minutes and securing the fourth-best 8K time in
Grinnell history. Honig was followed hy fcllow scnior Justin Rllcy,
who finished in 18th placc with a 25:17. David Krist ’08 took 34th
place with 25:35 and Drake Bnllcw'09 finished in 47th place with a
time of25:55. Charlie Knuth ’08 made it into the men’s top five with
a time of 26 minutes ﬂat, which earned him Slst place.

The Augustana meet was an important turning point in the sea
son, because it marked the team‘s transition from aerobic training to
anaerobic training.

The team was "more focused on the training exercise than on
trying to win the meet," stud men’s coach Will Freeman. The men
followed a prcdcﬁncd strategy at Augustana, pacing themselves at
the beginning of the race and picking up speed at rhc end.

“They were just passmg people left and right at the end," said
Will Freeman. ”It was very encouraging.”

The next mccr is or Wartburg on ocr. 8, which will providc both
teams with an opportunity to preview the course and the competir
tion that they will face at the NCAA regional meet in November.
The men’s and womcn's reams both have their eyes on qualifying for
nationals.

“This is definitely the most talented team we’ve ever had," said
Evelyn Freeman. “We’re In a tough rcgion so it's going to he tough,
but we’re going to go for it and see what happens."
