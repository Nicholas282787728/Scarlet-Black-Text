U.S. premier of film by Grinnellian m ;

1735 Km (2005)

Romantic comedy follows two
strangers across Vietnam

* Bv LAWRENCE SUMULONG

When Kay Nguyen '07 came hack to campus after
taking a year off, she had gained a new appreciation
of what Grinnell meant to hei. Of course, she had
also gained credentials as the screenwriter and assis»
rant director ofa feature ﬁlm.

A year after her ieturn, after journeying multiple
times along a route up and down Vietnam throtigh
five major cities from Hanoi to Saigon and back,
Nguyen finally has a chance to show off the fruits of
her labor.

Her cinematic brainchild 17.75 Km has its U.S.
premier on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Harris in-
cmd. Ngmgen will speak at a reception in the Harris
lobhy at 7:00.

Nguyen signed on with the film when she was
approached by a ﬂedgling production company, l<y
Dong Productions, looking for aspiring young artists
interested in making films.

The company had discovered her through ﬁlm
reviews she had written for English and Vietnamese
publications. They asked her to write a screenplay, and
she accepted.

According to Nguyen, 17.75 Km is a romantic
comedy following the scenic journey of two strangers,
a male and a female, stranded together and pennilcss
in the northern city of Hanoi, desperate to ﬁnd their
my home to the southern city of Saigon. The film’s
title refers to the distance the two characters traverse.

For the ﬁrsrrrimc screenwriter, the working pro-
cess was an artistic journey, but also one that led to
realizations about the commercial aspect of film.

“Film is a very funny product of this century,"said
Nguyen. ”It's the very mix between money and art
you have to make money to make ﬁlms. And some-
times as you go along, the executive producer gets to
say a lot and they usually control the artistic things."

“Basically, the whole [cinematic] production is a
very unglamcrous process and it takes a lot of hard
work and not just expressing your own artistic
ideas,"she said. “I was very lucky to have the director
tutoi me in writing and also the politics of the whole

COURTESTY KAY NGUYEN

thing."

Nguyen found surprising links between her year
long adventure and her time in an Iowa classroom.

“You have to take a step back in order to appreci»
are something and so I took a year of? and while I
was workingl constantly found that all of the skills,
the way ofthinking, even the pleasure ofworking was
actually determined, largely by the Grinnell experi-
ence,” she said. ”Anyone who passed the Grinnell or-
deal [is] equipped with something very precious."

TV-based flick doesn't bring reviewer “serenity"

Serenity (2005) tttﬁﬁ

Movie has sappy dialogue, but
will please Firefly fans

What do you get when you cross a countryrwcstr
em movie and a scirﬁ (lick? Well, actually, you get
something like Star Wm. But this isn’t Star Wars.
This is Serenity, thl: Tinseltown version of Joss
Whedon’s “Fireﬂy,” a shortrlived TV series that dies
veloped a small cult following before being cancelled
in its first season.

Scrcnily takes place approximately 500 years in the
future. Earth is long abandoned, but never fear: Hue
manity thrives in terraformed planets. These planets
are all part of the Alliance, your standard, tyrannical

“government gonc amok.” The Alliance’s oppressive
rule doesn't quite extend to the planets on the outer
rims, and they once fought a war for independence
from the Alliance. Unlike in Star Want, the rebel scum
lost. From this is spawned the Millennium Falcon
no wait, I mean the Serenity, and its stalwart crew
full ofwiserasses, led by the intrepid captain Malcom
“Mal” Reynolds (Nathan Fillion—don't worry, I’ve
never heard of him either)

Apparently, everybody’s a comedian in the he
tnre. The dialogue gets pretty damn laughable in a
way only a movie based directly on a TV show could
manage. You know, the kind ofsappy “She’s torn up
plenty, but she’ll ﬂy tnie" talk which no doubt pleased
the hell out of“Fireﬂy" loyalists but amused the hell
out ofme. The crew shines when they talk amongst
themselves It's amusing enough, though overdone

seeing as nearly everybody onboard gets in a zinger
01' two.

What didn't amuse the hell out of me was the glare

ing anaehromsm. This is the future, right? They’ve
got super-fast spaceships with laser cannons and all
that jazz, 50 why the hell is the crew walking about
with pistols and pumprilcnon shotguns? One or them
even uses a bow and arrow, fcr chrissakes!

Eventually, after puttering around the planets for
a while dodging super-crazy cannibalistic humans
called Reavers and Alliance attempts to recapture ex»
perimental psychic girl named River (who is played
by summer Glau and looks like that girl from The
Ring), the crew discovers a terrible secret that the Al-
liance had buried, setting up the climactic fmal battle
in which the low budget ofthis ﬂick truly shines. The
special effects aren't terrible, mind you, but they do
look about 10 years old.

Snmily is a decent enough picture as long as you
don’t mind having all these loose ends from the TV
show never fully explained or cliched dialogue straight
out of the box.
