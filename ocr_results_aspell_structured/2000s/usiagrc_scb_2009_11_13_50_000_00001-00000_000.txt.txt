Campus Climate

assesment brings to
light the concerns of
marginalized groups

BY SOLOMON MILLER

This past Monday night. over 100
members or the student body, faculty and
the staff gathered at the open forum to
discuss the climate of the campus as as-
sessed by Rankin and Associates

Dr Sue Rankin. who led the assess—
ment team, explained her findings on how
comfortable and accepted Grinnell Slu’
dents, faculty and staff feel in the cams
pus environment, Her data confirmed the
worry that various biases are prevalent in
the Grinnell community.

According to the report, racism, sex-
ism, heterosexism, institutional classism
and ableism reportedly all have a signihs
cant impact on people’s daily hves. Only
about 63 percent of those who responded
to the survey identified as “comfortable"
or "Very comiortable“ on campus, nota-
bly lower than many similar institutions
in the country. Roughly 30 percent of re-
spondents reported having been harassed
in some way due to prejudice and approxr
mately 60 percent of students reported
witnessing some form of harassment.
Constituencies in the administration, the
student body and the faculty all hope to
use these data as a basis for reducing the
effect of these prejudices.

“You’ve got data you can [refer to],”said
Vice Precident of Diversity and ACthVC'
merit Elena Bernal. “You don’t have to rely
on your own experience."

Bernal hopes that with this informa
tion available, members of the Grinnell
community will no longer depend on
anecd0t857polentially private ones—to
form their views. She claims that hold
ing conversations about biases based on an
official study will eliminate the potential
disconnect between different perceptions
oflife at Grinnell.

“Now we [have] a chance to sit on the
same side of the table as Grinnellians, and
look at this information and decide ‘ls this
what we think our community could be,
would be, should be?"’Bernal said.

John Burrows ’10, an intern at the of
free of Diversity and Achievement who
helped organize the campus Climate As»
sessment and determine how it was pre-
sented to the campus, echoed this senti-
ment.

“These are the things we are talking
about, things that have existed for years
and years, but we didn't have the data to
back it up," Burrows saidi

Burrows believes that the community
should observe how the faculty and stu-
dent body could make Grinnell a safer
place where all community members are
valued—feel that way,

Rankin suggested that one important
step forward is for members of the com-
munity to invest themselves in reducing
bias within their already established social
circles. Rankin believes that Grinnellians
should “create change in [their own]
sphere ofinfluence."

TAG raises Trans Awareness

till KATHERINE CHUNG

Grinnell's Transgender Action Group
(TAG) sponsored Transweek—starting last
sunday and running through yesterdayms an
event to kickoff the newly group and to raise
awareness about the transgender population on
campus

Trans Week events included a game of all
campus tag a round table discussion of sex in
transgender relationships, crossdress to class
day, a movie showing of Hedwig and the An-
gry Inch and a transgender remembrance event.
TAG organized the week's events in collaborav
tion with other student organizations such as
All Boys Cinema (ABC), Lesbian Movre Night
Organized Procrastination (LMNOP), (Amer
Rainbow Super Team (QRST), Grinncll Col-
lege Christian Fellowship (GCCF), and thc
Sexual Health Information Center (SHIC),

TAG is a new student group on campus
this semester, led by NikJameson Y11 and Evan
Hunsley ’11, which provides a space to discuss
issues and questions regarding transgenderism,

as trans or cisgcnderithosc who are not trans-
genderediwho are interested in increasing vise
ibillty for the uans population on campusiThe

to be transgender, in order to create more one
derstanding between the two communities.

Members ofTAG organized Transgender
Awareness Week as an effort to initiate TAG
as a student group, aimed at raising conscious-
ness about the existence of a trans population at
Grinnell and fostering an environment where
trans students can express themselves freely

“I think [talking about being transgender]

is considered a taboo," Jamison said , “People ,

think because Grinnell is an accepting and dis
verse community, all aspects of that diversity are
automatically accepted. [Howevcr,] there's a lot
of room for growth even within our diversity.”

On Tuesday, the entire campus had the
opportunity to literally ptit themselves in the
shoes of indiViduals that identify as transgender
through cross Dress to Class Day, which was
perhaps the most visible event of Trans Week.

Grace Phillips '12, reﬂected on gender
bending after cross-dressing on Tuesday, re-
counting that no one seemed to take special
note of her transgendered garb. “In my opins
ion, women's clothing is geared towards women
much more than men’s clothing to men.That is,
women's garments tend to be form fitting and
often emphasize a woman's breasts, vmist, and
or butt, whereas men's clothing tends to be relae
tivcly neutral," Phillips said.

dents and Director of Residence Life and Ori—
entation, shared a similar experience when she
crosssdressed to work on Tuesday. explaining
that her appearance “was strangely under the
radnti"

Conner participated in the event to show
her commitment to trans students on campus
and to signal to trans students that she is aware
of the issues that they might be facing.

“As people start to understand more ofwhy
we look to create gender neutral spaces 1 do
think that some basic education oftransgender
issues happens," Conner said. “This [week was]
an opportunity to interact more with people
who ate trans or people who have trans people
in their lives and to learn about the layers of
[rranslidenrity issues."

For coelcader Jameson, being transgender
is another aspect of individuality that can be
unique to each person. “1 feel like being trans-
gendered is just another part of your identity,
along with liking certain kinds of movies or
bein partial to different colors,"]ameson said.
“It’s%about] understanding how to make your
gender work and how to help other people un-
derstand what )mur gender is,whoever you are."

The group meets every Tuesday at 9 PM in
the Student Resource Center (SRC) in Younker
Pit.
