After responding to cxrraordinary demands pm on the eurrenr
facilities, an enormous building complex, in an architectural style
incongruous with rhe rose ofrlic campus, was bcing consrrucred on
rhe norrlrern lulfcifthc Grinnell College earnpus, Named aher some
ofthe largest donors in Grinnell history, it had the latest in modern
amenities. Was it the East Campus building cam»

building campaign of1943i

Darby hosred irs ﬁrst collcgiare game on Dec.
7, 1942, one year [0 the day after Peatl Harbor,
(Gtinnell bezt Iowa State, 37-30,) Since its omclal
completion rhe follawing year, rhe herliry has been
the site of commencement ceremonies, lectures,
eonrerencos, dances. conoerrs, and a speech made
by Manin Lurher King, Jr. Moreover, ir has been a
center for the entire tOWn.

Darby name inro being whcn the women's gym-
nasium burned to the ground in 1939. When the
women rook over the men's old gym betweenARH
and Noyce science censor and the men demanded
anoLhet gymnasium for rhemselves. rho College
swung inro actionsT‘hcyhuilt an Arr Deco gymna»
sium with the besr “modern equipmenr, rraining
mourccs, 1nd recreational areas." The Athletic Director’s AdminisV
ttative Assisrznt Patty Johnson, who was “born and raised in Grin—
ncll" and “has spent all but ﬁve years" of her life hem, mminisces
about the amenities.

“There were plenry or locker rooms," she said, “The sonrhern
end of the gym used to have reserved seating. The seats looked like
they were speckled marble."

Wirh World War II well underWay, Darby provided “physical
education resources and an assembly are: for the hundmd: of men
on ampus in rhc Army Specialiud Training Program in 194344,"
amending ro rhe Grinnell College website,

When rhe Army left Darby afrer the war, rhe College and Grin»
nell High School moved in.

"I love shooting has»
kets with my family
and heating the echo
off of Darby’s walls
with every bounce. It
feels like the 'H00-
siers’ movie.”

men's basketball coach

“From rhe ‘505 to was, the Grinnell High School would use rhe
building for baskcrball games," said Johnson. “The high school games
would bc on Fridays, somerirnos Tuesdays, and rlrc College gamos
would be on rhc weekend."

Sometimes, rhaugh, ceirarn college orrioials wouldn't like Crin-
nell inhabiranrs ro rnrniele too much. “My lursband, who played on

rhe thnnell High school baskerball ream,
would be chased our of rhe gym by [Gnnnell
coaching legend] John l’ﬁtsch," explained
Johnson, “and rhen niyhnsbandwould .usr run
around rhe building and rush baek in rhe orlrer
side... It was grear orrhc College as share"

Despire renewed enrhusiasm in the neilny, Darby is no longer as
