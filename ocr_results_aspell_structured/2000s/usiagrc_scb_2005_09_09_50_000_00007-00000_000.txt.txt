The History
The girls at the Ortman ShurSha
drink their water srraight
from Mason jars, modge
podgc on the coffee table
and trade selfrdefense
rips as they eat a tag teams
prepared dinnei. The male
population of Grinnell is wary of
1125 Broad street from past exper'r
cncbknown last year as “Chastity
Manor"7but the six new, tough girls
or the house claim they're males
friendly “I wouldn't want to live with
boys," said Laura Mason-Marshall
’06, “out we have plenty otgentlernun
callers."The residents also claim they
don’t gossip (except about professors)
at blast much Ani Difranco (they
prefer ShaniaTwai .

The Name

According to Sarah Lu ‘07, it was
not easy to determine the house’s
name. “There were lots of fistﬁghts
about it," she saidwhile the residents
claim they discovered the name while
taking an educational field trip to the
Grinnell Historical society Museum,
others say that it was named in honor
of their friend Shana Ortrnan. a for
mer Griiinell student, The residents
say that their Broad Street abode is
one of the best examples of Ortman
style architecture, which was popular
in the early 19005 and is characterized
by a boxy shape and a shirsl‘id (an en~

closed eupola on the root).

They instantly connected to
the house, “I Feel like there's a little
piece of Ortmali instde me,“ said

The Legend

The sha-sha resembles a smallnviir
dowed box set atop the house's roof, just
large enough for two people to ventuie
up the iickety ladder from the attic and
squeeze inside. The seven girls found
evidence that previous owners had put
“beacons" such as an old disco ball and
a police Light in the sha-sha, possibly
to alert residents of parties, Although
the shaesha is good for a quick high
altitude View of the town and campus,
it could be a health risk to stay there
for too long. “There's a lot of asbestos
up there," said Lu. “We think it may
have killed a bird." Indeed, a dead bird
inhabits the shaesha along with the
party beacons. Its carcass has yet to he
removed because none of the residents
want to touch it.

The Day-to-Day
Whether relaxing on the front
porch that, holding two sofas, might

as well be the living room, or tending

- to the garden of basil, sunﬂowers and

jalapenos, those living at the Ortman
embrace a laideback, communal life

.style. The social life of the house re-

volves around the kitchen, since all the
girls like to cook. Chores are divided
up by assigning everyone weekly'duties
on a sheet ofcolorful paper christened
“The Tour of Duty"and is ieminiscent
of preschool chore charts. Each weekly
task has a elite name to soften the hard
work, such as The Butler or Scrub
Dub. Clearly the most important task is
The Maishall of Fun, a title that charg-
es the person with vast responsibility
The Marshall is in charge or pl anning a
house social event, a tradition perhaps
inﬂuenced by years oi' living “11th the

parking lot tor Russell K. Osgood's
ofﬁce. so rhe girls see him when»

hard worker." said Dale. noting
that Osgood occasionally comes
into the ofﬁce on Saturdays. The

neighbor. Lu said that he occa»
sionzlly waves at her as she bikes
up to the back yard.
