What happened to
lnterVarsity in ‘96?

by Erik Gable
Staff Writer

At times, more tumor than fact has
surrounded the intervarsity Christian
Fellowship controversy Overthe last four
years, the story has circulated so much
thatsonic orrrs incarnations are vrrtually
unrecognizable.

Even the national press got in on the
act, astMay, the Mrs/ringtorr iirnarwrote
thalr“Grmncll College. in Central Iowa. ..
uncharrctcd its chapter ofIVCF during
the 199637 school year after a homo-
sexual studont wnt told he could not lead
the group. " ln (act, the student in ques-
tron was riot gay, and was not even male.

Reverend Dennno Shorb, the college
chaplain, who at the center or evens in
late mo. in October otthat year, she
recalled, an lrrtcrvarsity stallr member
who had been working with the campus
chapter met with her “and told one they
had made a decision that they wanted to
sham with mc."

Shorb said the staff mcmbct, Anna
Carney, had been preparing core mem—
bers of the group to load a bible study
session on the First chapter of
Corinthians, During the course of their
mccting.5horh said Carney drewaserot
concentric circles representing basic [tr
ncu oflntervarslty, arcas where leaders
“could agree to disagree," and arms where
they absolutely had to be uniﬁed.

Listed as bnic tcncrs were such staples
of Christian philosophy as rhc divinity
of Jesus Christ and the authority ortho
Bible, leaders didn‘t have to agree on
whether tarntat women should be allowed
to assume leadership rolm in the church.
And they had to agree that drunkenness,
premarital sex, and homosexuality were
all sins.

Angela Bishop '61, a leader orrhc
Grinnell College Christian Fellowship,
sard hcr understandingwct that the chap.
ter loaders, not the larger lnrorvorslty
oigluizimon, concluded homosexuality
riln counter to Biblical rcnchlngs.

ln ClKlK‘r cnsc, the statement caused .1
personal conﬂict for olic lchdc-r. “At the
end oilhnr biblc study," Shari: said, “this

She wnnletl the other lcntJt-rs to tie-
