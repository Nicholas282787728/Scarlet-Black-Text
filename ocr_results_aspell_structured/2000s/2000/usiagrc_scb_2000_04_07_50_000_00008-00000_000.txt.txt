Letters to
the Editor

Dear Editor,

While I haven'r arrended as
‘many loinr board moorings as
Counncy Sherwood or pro»
posed impeaehrnene ror as
many senarors as Mar Marr, I
do have enough knowledge and
observarion of sen operarion
ro have been :xiremcly srarrled
by rhe Smile: (a lilac/e3 edito»
rial seaif’s arriele “sen is Bro-
ken" rhar appeared just before
break. irs claims were unsub-
sranriared and ies conclusions
were foolish.
sen bylaws, like rhose or
any orher adminisrrarive orgae
nizarion, are subjeer ro eonsranr
seruriny and ﬂux; rhe several
recenr discoveries of leaks in
rhis code eerrainly don’t seem
ro require srarring from scrareh
and “invcni[ing] a new one."
The cdirorizl’x eomplainr
abour a “lack of eonirnuniea—
rion” is nor somerhing unique
ro crinnell or any orher self-

governing body in hisrory, The
weakness of all represenrarive
governmenr is a reliance upon
popular involvemenr, and ir is
unreasonable ro expeer some
mysrerious new sysrern to sud-
denly change rhe raer rhar
“mosr people living on campus
have no idea whar [SGA] is up
[0,"

I therefore urge srudenrs ro
approach any reform of SGA
wirh more caurion and logie
rhan was expressed in rhis
paper’s edirorial.

The Smrltz and Blue/e has a
monopoly of new:»mcdia on
campus issues. While 1 applaud
rhe editors’ eommirmenr ro
opening dialog on perrinenr
questions, I encourage chem, if
rhey wish ro begin a rradirion
ofsrarredirorials, ro presenr a
dissenring opinion in order ro
fully explore any issue ofcon-
rroversy.

To the Ediror,:

A letter from Mali Lorem. in
lasr Week’s sods lambasred rhe pa
per for nor prinring rhe enrirery or
her hairepage long lerrer on rhar
issue we’ve already heard so much
abour, rhelirring ofeconomitsano
rions on Iraq. 1 would like re re-
spond ro Ms. Lorenz’s arriele on
we fronrs.

First, 1 obieer ro her characrer.
izarion ofzhe sans sraiias an une
commirred group oipeople “whose
elass papers rake prioriry over a
piddly arnele." I shouldn'i say rhis
in a public forum, bur l have
skipped a number oFclasses in or-
der ro eover evenrs in a nmely lash.
ion. I also see rhe paper's edirors,
one of whom lives down rhe hall
from me, working lare inro rhe
nighr and somerimes spending
rivenry or rhirry hours a week, on
rop orclasses. ro produce rhe news
paper. 1r is on rheir behalf, in par.

ncular, rlrar 1 ﬁnd Ms. Lorene's lu—
rer insulring. The people whose
names you see every week in rhe
5&8, wherher ar rhe rop orarrieles
or underneath rhe paper’s masi—
head, work hard and are eerrainly
nor uneomnrirred.

Second, I do not believe rhar
rhe Sam’s credibiliry has been de.
srroyed beeause rhe paper didn't
have space ro prinr rhe anriesanc—
rions group’s SOOrword diarribe in
iis enrirery Thar week’s opinion
secrion also included rwo lcucrs
abour rhe previous week’s anrierape
rally and one abour diversiry as an
issue in rhe sen presidennal glen»
iions, borh ofwhich are issues very
signiheanr ro rhe Grinncll college
campus. 1 have spoken far roo or-
ren wirh represenearives anrlous
aerivisr groups who feel (hat iris
rhe sseb's dury eo provide a soap
box For rhem and rheir per causes,
Ifihc 5&B chooses ro give more
space so eampus issues rhan ro yer

anorher lerrer abour an internae
rional issue rhar one or rhe cam»
pus' mosr srridenr aerivisr groups
has been shoving in our faces for
rhe lasr several monrhs, rhar‘s nor
irresponsibiliry. That’s having irs
prioriries srraighr, The SEAS
should no more devore an enrire
half page ro Iraq rhan ir should,
say, ignore eampus issues ro focu:
on rhe sourh Carolina presidene
rial primary.

There is a rime and a place for
everyrhing. The anriesanerions
group's publieiry srunrs and in»
nammarory rherorie have made
rhe enrire earnpus aware ofrhis is»
sue. The issue is already wells
known and is nor a local issue;
rhererore, rhe 5&B should no! be
under any obligarion ro serve as a
soapbox.

Sincerely,

Erik Cable ‘02
