enough ro write zbout ir. He and his neighbor were en.
gaged in a conversation that weirr 3 hide like this:

Neighbor: “1 don’t know whsr's up with rhe college
kids."

Friend: “whar do you mean?"

The Harris syndrome

Like many Grinnell students, I recently
attended my ﬁrst‘ Harris Party of the year.
Though I don't like to admit it, I do acca~
sionally enjoy shaking my ass to the 'N Sync
Boys or Britney Aguilera (or whatever the hell
those teen stars, who will soon be washed
up, in rehab, and featured on VHl's “Behind
the Music", are called) while dodging care-
lessly tossed cups of Harris beer. What makes
Ham's parties truly great, however, is the op-
portunity to meet dozens of new people. At
my last Harris party, I met, talked to and
danced with several Grinnellians who were
formerly unknown to me. We even hit a few
post-parties logelheh I went home that night
excited by the prospect of spending time in
the future with my newly-made Harris friends.
Sadly, the next few days when 1 said hi to
these same people, the magic and the alco
hol of Harris had worn on, and very few people
even remembered my name.

Website woes

The Grinnell College website sucks. It’s
badly designed, visually unappealing, and
speaks poorly or our college. You'd be hard
pressed to ﬁnd a site anywhere that so bla»
tantly violated the simple rules at HTML. The
stupid little colorechanging rectangle "navi-
gation bar" graphics look like a terribly un»
rrearive 5-year-old had a nasty runein with
Phatoshop. Screw rankings; it's not 199/.
anymore. Prospective students will look at our
college website, and if 1 were a prospective.
I’d think less or Grinnell after seeing it. Don’t
know what in talking about? Just look at
some other college websites. took wherever
you applied; it doesn't matter, They’re all
better than ours. At least the old site we'd
had since the beginning of time knew what
it was: the website of a college incapable of
hiring someone competent enough to make
a good website.

Petition against petitions

We have all had the experience: Vou
walk innocently into the post ofﬁce, fari-
tasizing about getting real mail (as op-
posed te intercampus junk mail), and en
route ﬁnd yourself wading past a sea of
people attempting to force you to sign a
petition.

I’m not opposed to the idea of peti-
tions: I've even signed a few. However,
when we poor students with names at the
and ofthe alphabet go to check our mail,
I feel we have a ﬁght to do so without
being thrown into a guilt trip for not sup~
porting a speciﬁc cause. 1 often don't agree
with the ideas in a petition and plain don't
want to sign.

To all nonepetition signers out there .
. . let’s mail an antiepetition petition and
stake out the post ofﬁce someday next
week! . r . or maybe not.
