Advice for your problems

Dmr Salt,

work. I star; to Cry Suddrn/y and I dun) know why. It
worries me,

rrOut afCarl/rol
Dear Out of Comm],

iris hard ro feel like one is in conirol. The qiiesrion is, how
rriueh eonrrol does a person need ro have. Should you ler go? Do
you need so deeide rhar you did your hesr. or even nor your besr,
bur ir is good enough? Somerimes ii is necessary so acccpi rhe
fact that, because you only have a limised amounr of rime and
energy, work rhar is nor acceprable by your srandards is good
enough,

Maybe she sudden crying is a sign rhar you need help from
The Mcnral Health cenrer. Talk ro your RLC abour symproms
ordepression. Make an appoinrmenr ar The Menral l-iealrh Cen-
rer, or go ro your RLC, one or rhe chaplains, or rhe academic
advising ofﬁce for help.

Take care oryourselr,
Sarah Liebman

Dear Out ofCunuol,

God, I really don'r know whar in say, l‘in in rhe same esacr
boar you are. You reel like you are splir iour dim-rear ways like
you are being quarreied.

’Hmm. I say rhe ncxi rime you reel like you are as she poinr
when you .ire aboui ro lose eoiirrol while doing your work. iusr
srop, ar leasi For an hour. Walk, sleep, ralk ro a lriend, anyihiog
rim is nor relared ro rhe work you are doing This only works as
a cluiek Fix righr when you‘re ai ihe poinr oibreaking. When you
reel like you are losing conriol, you rank do .ioy work anyway
and rhe pressure or nor being able ro do work makes ilie sirua.
riun even worst,

Long rerm, I can giiie you rhese suggesrioos and you can make
a decision From ihere; consider going io menral healrh iralking
ir our vvirh a rrained meCSSlonill could help) and/or leaving For
a ew days before ﬁnals (This can help clear your head so you or

Hope rhis helps,
