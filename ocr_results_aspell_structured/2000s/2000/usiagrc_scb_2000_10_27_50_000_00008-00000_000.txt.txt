Soon after 1 wrose my firss arsiele shis ssmesser, l realised
shas my critique of eonsemporary aessheries mighs be inser.
prered in ways i had nos inrended. May shis assisle serve so ses
ssraighswhas my posision is, and so add so is a few ideas l have
reeeiisly formulased.

When eonfronsed wish she plassie, MoDonaldized world
around as, people may reaes in several dlffcrcnt ways.

. Some aeeeps she sisuasion as benign, elaiming shas if
people shoose so eonsnnie eheap, massaprodneod. adversised
goods, who are we so eririeize rheir free ehoiee.> is is elear shas i
do nos agree wish shis assessmens. -

. Some seeognise she sisuasion as unrorsunase. bus un-
avoidable. The moss useful shing we ean do, shey say, is ior us
so urge individuals so shange whas shey sonsume and appreci»
are. This, again, is nor my view, While I acknowledge shas is is
useful so eonsider individual ehoiee, I argue shas she un.
forsunase sondision of our world is, in fact, avoide
able.

. Some diseern she moral and aesshesie deea.
denee among us, and seek so quell is rhrongh eensor.
ship. This also 1 reiees.

My posision is shis: she ugliness in our mode
ern soeiesy is bad: is is avoidable; and we
can ﬁghs is lay [hangingt/Iriyxttm, so rhas
she soeiesal forces shas have ereared is no
longer eaiss. This requires no eensorship.

Rasher, is ealls {or a demoerasiaasion ofrhe

arsissie proeess, plaeing aesshesie produesion in she hands of
she people shas muss be exposed so is. This posision sails for a
new soeiesy, in whieh all people have assess so meaningful cuis
rural eduoasion, in whieh all people have an equal opporsunisy
so make sheirarsissie produess known, and in whieh all people
have she abiliry so enjoy she arsissie aeeornplishmenss of she
sosiesy. -

Yes by condemning whas I do nos like. am I nos just as
bad as any moralissie eonservasive or dogmasie :uthoriurian?

No, I am nos, Les me explain how i have some so my
posision.

Firsr, 1 rejees she exueme relasivism shas prohibio anyone
from passing judgmcnt on she sasres Dfuthcrs. While she world
erumbles abous me, I refuse so ssand by, mumbling ealmly so
myself, “All is well, eaeh person is ﬁe: so do as he chooses." I
will nor aeeeps shings she way shey are, and 1 insiss shas is is nos
only my sighs, bur my duty, so eall inso quession all shas I see,
and so speak our againss is lfI deem is uniuss. This is nos
aushorisarianisin. This is saking a ssand.
