By Andrew Sherburne
Sporls Wriler

Mulriple ehoiee quesrion (5
pts): Whar is rhe eause orrhe Pio-
neer men‘s reeenr losing streak?

A. Poor three-point shooring

E, Second halfslump

c, Foul problems

D. All orrhe.above...or maybe
none ofthc above. In fact, it’s kind
ofhard ro pinpoinr one reason why
our beloved ’Nects haven‘t been ﬁll-
ing up rhe W eolumn larely.
Maybe 5 just bad luck.

Answer: D.

Ger rhe picture? lr seems rhar
crinnell just ean'r buya break. One
night rhey go eold in the seeond
half, rhe next rhey‘re dropping
bombs like rhe Enola Gay bur rhey
have rhe misrorrune or playing a
ream rhar just won'r wear down.

SIHCC we last saw the Pioneers,
before winrer break. rhey‘ve gone
2—7. During rhar srrereh rhe no.
neers have scored as few as 60, and
as many as 126,

Urrrorrunarely, borh rimes ir
wasn'renough.

“We experimenred wirh some

more rradiripnal rhings and realized
rhar rhey are yusr nor who we are,”
explained eo—eaprain Luke
Flocker‘tl '01. “The personnel rhar
we currently have requires an open
and up-rempo ﬂoor in order to
level rhe playing ﬁeld."

The break did have as high
points, including a 111-93 win
over Beloit fueled by a 45.poinr
performanee by Mike Hoehman
’01. The Pioneers also notched a
105—93 win over perennial roe Mt.
Merey, avenging a loss earlier in rhe
year.

So whar about rhose losses=

“Physical play hurt us." said
Andrew Choquettc ’00. “our ope
ponenrs’ sizezllowed them to push
us around. over rhe eourse or the
games, we just couldn't mareh up.
Our sysrem relies on intensity and
the abiliry ro wear down rhe orher
team."

The srars done he. overrhe lasr
four games rhere has been an aver.
age ofGO rouls per game. The end
resulr is more ehanees ror rhe op-
ponenr ro eareh irs brearh, whieh
limirs the erreenveness orrhe eagers’

game plan.

The next rwo weeks are huge
for rhe Pioneers, with ﬁve games
againsr Midwesr Conference oppo»
nenrs. lneluded in rhar sn-ereh are
crinnell‘s final home games orrhe
year Monmourh next Wednesday
and Lake Foresr next Saturday.

“in a lot orways whar we do
for rhe remainder of rho season is
abour how well we can exeeure our
game plan. I‘ll be more eoneerned
abour my ream and irs play rlran
our opponenrs," phllosophized
Coaeh David Arseneaulr.

unronunarely, Grinncll maybe
without leading seorer Woody
Piirto 'oz for tonight’s game ar
Ripon.

“There is a lot ororrense our of
rlre lineup with Woody gone. He
has really been on rep oihis game
larely and marking some groar
srrides as a player," said Floelrerai,

But don‘r be roo alarmed: Film)
is only expected ro miss rhrs one
game, and in rhe meannme, rhe resr
orArseneaulr’s arsenal ofweapons
will have re fire just a--lirrle more
orren.

rhey did, m a 91443 demolishing
ofthe Pioneers.

St. Norbert dominated the
game from srarr to ﬁnish. Ar nines

she summed up rhe ream'ssen-

ro do would be ro Forger Friday
nighr’s debaclci “The only rhing l
ean say abour i-‘nday’s eonresr rs
that we wcrc Fortunate to have an»
orher game in less rhan 24 hours.
and l was incredibly proud thow
we responded," Wood said.

The Grinncll team that came

Ploncerx played mueh crisper in rhe
halfreourt game with improved hall
movement, They still turned the
ball over 18 times. but also had

Additionally, Grinnell ran the
hall more successfully than on Frir
day night. Wood does not consider
her ream a running ream, however.
and she will that the team liashten

“One or rhe brlghter spots or

Point guard Amy Walrers ’01

The game was a baelearrdronh
