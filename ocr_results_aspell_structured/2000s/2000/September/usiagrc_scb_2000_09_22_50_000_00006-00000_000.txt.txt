campus activists came
up with the idea of
forming a coordinated
group, which would
pool all of their re—

the tentative name of
GRINPAU: Grinnell Political Activists'
Union.

One ofthe architects ofGRlNPAU is Paul

those students graduate.

While the idot of GRlNPAU was con.

time, it seemed the community wasn't ready

however, the atmosphere was different.

has really awakened some sleeping dogs... and
it has created a newsonsoofa ridc that is turn.

The group is still in the planning stages,

Grinnellian of the Week:

Chuck Warpehoski

By Erik Gable
Staff Writer

our focus this week is on activism, so it's appropriate that our Grinnellian
of the Week is someone whose political conscience has spurred him to action,
both here in Grinnell and overseas, for over three years.

it's Friday afternoon in insiab, and Chuck Warpehoski is busy designing a
wcb page for Grinnell coliogc students Against Sweatshops, the group that
currently occupies most ofhis energy. The senior from Wisconsin is back on
campus after a semester in Central America, with a program sponsored by the
Institute for Central American Development Studies.

The program was based in Costa Rica, but Warpehoski spcnt most ofhis
lime in Nicaragua, workingwith a geodevoiopmcnr organization and a coop.
erative ofsmall farm workers.

"1 got to see how people in other contexts organized themselves to improvo
their situation, improve their lives,” he said.

The goodoveiopmenr organization Warpehoski worked with focuses on
building local orgmniaarions that can operate independently, so that communic
tics don’t become crippled by relianco on foreign aid.

”My job," Warpehoski explained, “was to try to understand why tbcy were
having dimculries with this one community.” poor. communication between
the organization and the community turned our to be one culprit.

While in Nicaragua, Warpehoski frequently found himself (he only En-
glish speaker in town. At the beginning of the semester, he and the other
program participants undorwent a month of intensive preparation in Costa
Rica, learning Spanish and getting acquainted with tatin American cultural
values.

The experience changed the focus ofWarpchoski’s activism. “The biggcst
thingi took away from it was a realization that my advocacy should be here in
the United states," he said. “They can handle things in Nicaragua. They don’t
need me there."

As a United States citizen, he said, “I believe it’s my role to advocate for
them here, so the U. S. isn’t interfering in their ability to make their own
decisions, to do th gs for themselves."

Warpehoskr's activism here on cam pus goes back to his froshman year, when
he worked on Free The Planets campaign against global warming. His stronr
gcsr memory of that campaign is of ‘going through the ioggias late at night,
chalking statistics about global warming, and rrying to bo wirry about it."

Warpohoski fondly remembers iasr yoar’s protests against Home Depot,
another F'l‘l’ campaign. “The exciting thing is that the campaign eventually
won," hc said, when Homo Depot agrcod to stop selling products made from
oldgrowth wood.

He’s worktd on campaigns ranging from freedom for EasrTimot to peace
with Iraq, bur right now Warpehoski is focusing on preparing studcnrsAgainsr
Sweatshops for the Octobcr mtcting of the Board ofTrusrocs, at which SAS
hopes to persuade the trustees to pull Grinnell College out ofrho Fair Labor
Association and join the Workers’ Rights Consortium.

Warpehoski’s other main focus is RISE, which is working against the death
penalty. He hopes to organize a panel discussion on capital punishment this
semester, probably in town. RISE is also coordinating with other iowa groups
to push for ending u. s. sanctions on Iraq. “it’s easy to activate and educate
the campus," he said. “The nert step is to reach out ofour comfort zone and
start building a large base orpeoplc to work on ending the war against iraq."

Warpehoski works hard for his causes, but he also has diversions. Like
fighting in Dagorhir, a campus group that stages mock combat with foam
weapons.

Warpehoski said, “I’m a swordfrghring peace activist."
