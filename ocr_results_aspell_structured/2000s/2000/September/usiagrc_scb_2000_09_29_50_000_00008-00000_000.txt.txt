A look at the trustees

The trustees are coming to town. Wlietlicr we host them in the
dorms or just stand around gawitingat them, weall sense that the trust.
ecs do important stutr, The Carleton Collegc website states that their
board. 1) oversees oithe kind ofeducation offered, 2) approves
budgets and manages funds; 3) selects the president and grants
degreesi 4) provides legal accountability, and s) promotes
thecollcges objectives. Based on those duties, it would make
sense to have a board composed oflcgnl, business. and Educ
cational cxpcris A board especially needs educational cxe
ports, since the primary mission and power of the
trustees is to chart the kind oreclucation we rc-
gceive. Yet as the accompanying table shows, only

a few omrinnell's trustees have professional ex.
perience dealing with educational matters. A great
number orour trustees are business whiazcs. But
when it comes to higher education, most orthem arc cliarlatans. Furs
thermore. our college claims it has a strong commitment to social rc«
sponsibility, yet the organiaarions that do the most to promote social
responsibility (nonprofits) are not represented on our Board otTrust
ees. compare this to Oberlin College, Oberlin also has a commitment
to social responsibility and excellence in education. And their school or
music is highly regarded. The composition oiOhcrlin's Board otTrust.
ecs appears to rellect the college’s goals and needs.
They have rcprescntation from business, law, non»
proﬁts, and the arts. And about oncefourth ofrhe
Board has professional experience in education. or
course, Oberlin isn't sitting on a billion dollars. Per-
haps they could use more business experts. Bur
Grinnell has so many business types and surgeons
that it could greatly increase its educational expel.
tise and still have more business expertise than
Oberlin.

Why should we have people who view the
world through an educational lens on the Board of
Trustees? Let’s picit a case study. How about stu—
dent-faculty ratio. According to 11.5. News and
Wot/d Report, Atahcrst and Swatthmore have the lowest studcntraculty
ratio (8:1) otthc top 25 colleges in the us. The shortcomings otthc
rankings aside, does anyone believe it is a coincidence that Amherst and
Swarthmore are ranked ﬁrst and second.> A low Student-faculty ratio is
an advantage at a liberal arts college. it leads to more personal attention
for students. a more reasonable worldoad for professors, and a broader,

faculty

pensive.

If ny college in this nation has the resources to improve their
college by lowering the sritdenttaculty ratio. it’s Grinncll. The trustees
are concerned about the base budget, as they should be, and adding
raculiy would swell the base budget. But we've got a billion dollars just
sitting around ensuring the nature viability otthe college. Surelywt can
find a way to use some otthat tnntiey to get profs without undrrmlnr

Despite all those promising improvements, our trustees have been
slow to see the advantages or having more professors. students and
faculty have told the trustees for years that our raculty site ts too small
and its diversity too low Only now are we seeing positive signals that
the trustees will lsubstantirely address either orthose concerns Indeed
last year the trustees were opposed to adding any faculty to the college,
The trustees viewed our low siudenivfaculry ratio with suspicion, not

Fortunately for American government ofﬁcials, they are
not held up to the same standards of justice that America, led
by supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, imposed on the test
of the world in the Nuremberg trials. In the famous trials of
Nazi war criminals, Jackson said. “The wrongs
