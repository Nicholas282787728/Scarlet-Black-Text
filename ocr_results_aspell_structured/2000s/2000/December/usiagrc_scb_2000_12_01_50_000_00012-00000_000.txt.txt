Women's basketball comes into this
season ready to forget the past and
turn momentum in their direction

by Nicholas Johnson
Spoils Editor

There is an old cliche in sporrs rhar most sporrs are games
or momentumirl winning ream won'r rind rlieinselves in lasr
place overnighr and a losing ream won'r break rhe slump in a
day,

For the Gnnncll women's basketball team, most of the
momenruin over the bar rwe years has been in rhe negarive
direction, The Pioneer: have tallied only one win in thc1998-
1999 and 1999—2000 seasons
combined,

But even the hardest skids
come ro a srop, and irrhia year's
rcam liasanyrhing ro say aboiir
it, the Pioneers will undergo a big
momenrum change due scason

“We’re coming into this war
son wirh a complerely differcnr
menraliry," guard Amy Walrers
'01, said. “In the past, we’ve
serrled for irisr allowing ourselves
as have run regardless orour
record. But let's face it, losing isn't
fun and I think we’re ready for a
change."

Head coach Jenny Wood
agreed wirli Walrers rhar rhe Plo-
neers are ready tor a ehange,

“The ream has high expezmr
rions abour its abilicy ro improve,
ro close the gap on reams and ro
have a chance ro measure in success in many rangible ways.”
Wood said,

Even wirh all die oprimism rhe ream has, purring up wins
Still won’t come :asily, Walter: and Wood said the team's hard
work and dererminarion will help, rhough.

“The level or play in praerices this year has raken a come
plcre rurn for rhe better," Walrers said. “We srep inro rhc gym
knowing we’re going to work our asses ofrunril we srop orr rhe
courr ar rhe end, and rhar new menraliry has been producing a
lot ofgood stuff on the court and off.

“Get ready tor us ro win a lor more games rhis year."

For Wood, a heavy dose of determination will have to be

"We've been treading water for three
years now, just waiting for a time
for us to get out of this rut. The
talent and skill level is there, the
quality playeis are there, but we
haven’t produced in the win column,
and most of that is because of a
larger mental block. Our goal is to
change that this year and leave the
past years behind us." ’

Wood was even more hesiranr ro make a comparison. “Each

Walrers said, “All i ran say is rhar everyone should expeer 2t

Nlckname power rankings make for MWC fun

There are many reasons why 1 like sporrs. There's rhc spirir
orcomperirion and pushing yourselrro rlie very limirs oryorir
abiliry There’s die grear enrerrainmenr sporrs provides for fans
and rhe grear paanmc rhey provide for arhleres. There’s rhc runny
words and sayings rhar sporrs give us, like “grip ir and rip it”
and “shuttlecock.”

But more than any orher reason, i like sporrs
beeause may give you an excuse ro rank rhings. I
love ranking rhings: 1 rank my elorhes based on
how cool i look in rhem, t rank my CDs based on
how cool owning rhem makes me look, 1
rank my friends based on how eool
rhey think i am. Some people,
rlioiigh, rhink rliar all rhis ranking is
a halo weird (guess where rhey rank
on rhar rriends liar).

Ranking sporrs rhings is nor
only unaveird. hur irls also eneoiiragcd ~ everyone in rhc sporrs
world does ir. The Assoeiared Press has eollege roorball rankings,
sporrs reams :er ranked by winvloss percenrage, ransarc ranked
by how many roam ringers/roam checsc liars/roam coin cobs
rhey own. While all rhesc rankings .ire born useful and run, by
far die bear kind orsporrs rankings are power rankings,

Power rankings are rlre lisrs rliar sporrs analysrs and ioiire
nalisrs eeme up wirh ro rarc reanis in a parricular sporr. Once
rliey have rheir power rankings, rhey ean easily eoinpare ihe
relarive srrengrlis orall rlie reams in rlrc league.

Since power rankings an e. grear, l was a liirlc disappoinred
ro ﬁnd rhar nor a single such list exiro ror reams in ihe Grinnell's
lirile earner orrhe NCAA, die Midwesr Conference, This is, or
course, an omission l musr correcr lsiir sincel really donr have
nme ro consrrucr rhese rankings ror every aporr, lve decided ro
make one all encompassing lisr based solely on rhe mosr impor-
mmfactorfordcmnnlllingsporlingsllzcuss: ream nieknames.

So, Prom besr ro worsr, here are rhe reams or die MWC in
Nickit Nicknames Power Ranking.

1. crinneil Pioneers. omen, yen dieln'r really drink ld risk

two balls, no strikes

being yiiinped byangry crinnellians when 1 passed rhe PEC by
purring us anywhere orher rhan firsr, did you? seriously, crinnell
has by rar rhe besr nickname in rhe MWC. Pioneers are ruga
gcd, coiirageoiis, srrong and good or reading maps. These skills
are all essenrial re any sporrs ream, so Grinnell was a nobrainer
ro rop ihe bar.

2. Carroll Pioneers. Ar first I was going ro pur Carroll in
lasr for srealing oiir nickname, bnr rhen I realized rhar l didn’r
know which school became rhc Pioneers ﬁrsr and i really had
no desire ro rind our, so I piir rhem in second. Also, iryon
soilinr your eyes and read “Carroll Pioneers," it's almosr indis:

ringiiishablo rrorn "crinnell Pioneers." so basically Carroll is
seeond berause l didn‘t have my
glasses on when I wrore rhis, and
frankly l eould barely makeourwhar
I was ryping.

3. Knox Prairie Fire, I know
Prairie» Pire sounds like rhe name or an expansion XFL ream,
biir iris iiisr so darn earehy rhar i had ro pur Knox iii rliiid l
long ro he rlie aporrs edirnr orrhe Knox paper insr because of
rhe headlines i would ger ro wrire roi rlie reams “Fire huin
comperiiion." “Prairie Pirc smoke opponenrs." “Them may be
‘air’ in prairie: bur hire roorball is all hear," Dang, where can 1
pick up a rransrer application?

4. Lawrence Vikings. Lawrence cerrainly doesn'r have rhe
mosr erearive nickname ever, biir ir could be worse, s rhey
rake rourrh. ‘licir ranking is boosred by rlie racrs rlrar Vikings
probably made it re North America way berore any orher Eur
ropean group, rim 1 am one-quarter Norwegian and rim i re
ally like rlie comic “Hagar die Horrible.“

5. Beloir Buccaneers Beloir. like Lawrenee. shares irs niek.
name wiih an NFL ream, so ir cant be all rhar bad. i also ﬁnd
rlre allirerarion appealing and alluring. i do find it a bir odd,
ihough, rhar Beloit rakes irs nickname from a group ors
going ilneves, bur i did dress iip as a pirare one year for H
lowcen, so l'm willing ro overlook rhar sliglir rain pm and keep
rhem ar rive.

o, Monmourh Pighring Scots. irrlrere's one rhing l’vc
learned from reading Marker/a, irls rhar rhe seers are a rough
buneh. Apparently Monmouih wasn‘r eoimring on everyone
being rlie Shakespeare scholar rim 1 am, so rhcy added “Fight-
ing" ro rlieir nickname ro remind people rhar rhey are really,
really rough. And yer 1 mt help biir pierure rheir baseball ream
sliding inro second in kilrs, so rhey ger pur in rhe boriom hair
orrhc rankings

7. 5r. Norberr Green Knighrs. lrn nor really sure whara
Green Knigln is, biir ir sounds like ir may be a comic book
hcro. If rhar’s rhe case, rhen I’d have an move sr Norberr way
up on rlie lisrbeeause rlreir reams may be endowedwirh arrange
super powers. Bursinee I don’r have a single issue orrhe Green
Kniglir among my comic book collecrion, they'll have ro serrle
ror seventh: I’d be willing ro move rhem iip ar leasr a spor if
rhey changed rlieir name ro rhe x.Men.

a. Ripon Redhawks. A ain, I like rlieallirerarion, Butsinccl
already used my clever allirerarion ioke on Beloir (and yes, hne
glisli mayors, I am aware rlrar reelinically repearing an inirial vowel
sound in a series or words is assonanee, nor allirerarion, so my
yoke isn’r as clever as i think) and since iliey could have called
rlieinselves rlie Ripon Rippers, I have re drop ihem io eiglirh.

9. take Forest Poresrers. Calling yoiirselrrlie Poresrers seems
