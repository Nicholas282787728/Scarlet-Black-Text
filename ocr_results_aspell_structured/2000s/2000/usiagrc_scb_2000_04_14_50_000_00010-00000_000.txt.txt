Revolutionizing Catholicis

The chan ing face of the Church under Pope

By Matthew Trager
StaffyColumnist

Though I have long found
much oi rhe carholic
Church’s dogma and many of
irs praciicos ro be confusing
and ourdared, I am amazed
and eneouraged by rhe reeenr
polirioal and humanirarian
aerions ofPopc John Paul ll.

When I saw rhe Pope lrneel
in prayer on rhe front page of
rhe March 13 issue or rhe NY
Times, 1 was nor quire sure
whar ro expect from rhe ar.
When i read ihe head
line, “Pope Asks Forgiveness
for Errors of rho Church
over 2,000 years,” I was ac—
rually shoelred ro rhe poinr of
