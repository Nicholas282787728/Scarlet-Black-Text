Thoughts from the Hague

here are parts oiernails Vanessa sent to the 0.5. while she was at the negotiations.

the night...was great. hiter being at the
conieience we headed back to our hostel, but
instead oi eating our regular meal there, we had
the pnvilege to have a wonderiul vegetarian (vegan
at that) meal (a rare thing here in the Netherlands
aka, the land or bread, meat, and cheese) aboard
one oi the Greenpeace ships...liaving grown up
heanng about the Greenpeace ships, it was great
to actually be on one and talk with the crew...

the iollowing day was one packed with action.
We started the day out in the conierence center
with the Iowa students (people irom Grinnell, inwa
State, and Univ. oi Iowa) meeting with one Senator
Haikin'saides. sire wasa veny iriendlyand recephve
woman. Although we did not see eye to eye on the
issue oi including carbon sinks in the protocol...,
we still had a great conversation. She gave us a lot
oi support ior the work that we are doing, and she
also gave us some advice as to how we could help
Sen. harkin move the Protocol along in congress,
assuming that we sign it here...

hiter that meeting we merged with a few oithe
ainnitygroups to do some X-mas caroling. We sang
songs with messages about global warming that
were in the tune oi Xcmas carols to the U5. and
some other more obstinate countries as well as to
the GEC. We also presented them with stockings
tilled with coal (coal that we actually got iron
the Greenpeace ship) and told them thatthey were
being "naughty, not nice” dunng the negotiations.
it was great. the press loved it, and many oi the
delegates couldn't help but crack a smile during
the action...

i have to say that the most inspirational thing
that i have experienced while at the hsgue was
dunno the sharing session that we students had.
As it is thanksgiving, we all took some time to

speak about our experiences here and the things
that we are thankiul ior in our lives. Many at us
iasted today tor the treaty. while every person had
their own personal reason ioriasting, many oithem
stressed the ovenconsumption in the us. that
occurs during our holidays; others linked it more
directly with Kyoto and said that they hope to be
thankful ior a good treaty on globnl warming at the
end oi the conierence, but at this point are too
disappointed with the U.S. delegation to engage in
the traditional dinner, Moving back to our shanng
as each person in that large room spoke, I ielt a
true connection to then, to the movement that we
are walking in, and to the world thatwe live in. We
expressed our gratitude ior the privilege (as in a
privilege oi class) that we have just to be able to
attend these negotiations, to be involved with the
environmental movement, to attend school,.. we
spoke oi our grateiulness to our iamily and
communities back at home ior supporting us and
lot iostering the compassionate, action—oriented,
and bold commitment that we have to the
environment and to our earth... and we spoke oi
theimmense giatitudethat we have ior having each
other. These people here with me at this tonierence
are amazing. they are passionate, responsible, and
driven. they are deep thinkers, n'skiakers, and are
solution seekers. they are the iutu re leaders oi this
planet, and they have every intention or treating
our earth with the respect and love that she
deserves. these students understand the enormous
responsibility that we have as U.S. citizens, as
people with conscience, as humans, to take care oi
our brothers and sisters, to monitor the political,
economic, and social actions oi our country, to
protecting our world.
