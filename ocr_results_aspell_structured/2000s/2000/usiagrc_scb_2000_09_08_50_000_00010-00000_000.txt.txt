Death by bee sting

Maybe it's because I’m more used to city lire. but
there seem to be e LOT of bees out here. Vou can't boss
a garbage can or a bike rack without seeing roughly
10,000 of them. and they tend to fly in smaller groups
allover campus.

How pathetic is it that these little insects have
struck fear into the hearts of the campus community.
It’s not safe to walk the streets at night knowing that
behind the ieavirlgs orthe last dorm party, the stinging
menace awaits to harass you. And if you're wearing
any sort or bright colors, you're as good as stung.

I, for one, don’t kriow' how to deal with these
hymer'soptemus hoodlums, since I'm sure that they’ve
adapted to most pesticides we can throw at them. 1
think I’tl take up fencingiafter all, that uniform does
look a lot like a beekeepel’s getup.

Consistent celebrations

As everyane here knows, ctassei at Grinnelt
remained in session on Labor Day, while seemingly
every other school had the day off. That in itself is
not 3 pmblem, After all, we're all here to loom, and
classes really don’t take the same amount of time out
oi our Hays as do most full—time jobs. The problem,
however, is the fact that every other service at Grinnell
was closed in honor of Labor Day.

T do believe that the workers here deserve the
day art. But having some portions of the campus in
session while others not in session is very confusing
and can throw off the schedules of everyone living
and working here. In my opinion, the campus should
either celebrate the holiday as a whole or not celebrate
it as 3 whole. it just makes life easier.

Eulogy

When I returned to campus this summer I was
disturbed to ﬁnd the glosses that I had so enjoyed
were gone vh'th no explanation. in their place were
giant plastic monsters that force you to commit to only
one or two beverage choices and spill without warning.
These tableware atrocities abo cause major backups in
uuod, due to their incompatibility with the TED certs.
i also have suspicions that they were indirectly
responsible for last week’s Styrofoam ﬁasco.

Iftherg was onythihg i missed about lirinrsell while
i was at home this summerit was the beverage glosses.
These charming half-sized cups were the perfect size
for an ice-cream sundae, and their small volume made
it easier for your tray to hold a variety of selections in
appropriate quantities. Their weight and stout stature
mode spilLs a rare occurrence, They were simply a joy. -
