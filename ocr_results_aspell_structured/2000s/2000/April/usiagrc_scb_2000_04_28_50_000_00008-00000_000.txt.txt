Dionysus/Earth Day

Dear Editor

twanted to drank ail thosewho
aided with the Environmental Ac»
tion Group's Disposablerree Earth
Day Picniclast Saturday, in particu»
lar Dick Williams and Jeanette
Moscr from Dining Services, Dine
ing Services has been very coopera.
tive with us in trying to implement
environmental practices within its
operation, including buying some
local roods and recycling most
packaging,

I also wanted to thank all those
who attended the picnic. Having a
picnic, at least from my standpoint,
means enjoying the outdoors, In the
conventional sense, enjoying the
outdoors simply means sitting on
the grass, eating hamburgers on
styrofoam plates and playing frisbee
with your dog in the sunshine.
However, i feel that having those
styrofoam plates at the picnic dame
ages the outdoors aesthetically and
also wastes the energy and resources
from the outdoors on dishes that
were only used once. Using
styroroam at picnics is therefore
damaging and wasteful ofoutdoor
resources, rather than part or its
enjoyment. Styrofoam plates were
created for convenience only, with»
out thought to the problems they
would cause the Farris and picnic cul-
ture. This one small item is onlya start
to a long list ofconvenience items ere
and without a though to their envi.
ronmental and piouc problems (don’t
even get me started on grass, frisbecs,
and dogs), I would like to thank all
most who attended for showing their
commitment to the outdoors and pic
nits, in ho'wever small a way, on the
drirricth anniversary ofEath Day.

Sincerely

Letter to the campus:

After the Dionysis music festi.
val, I assisted with the cleanup of
Mac Field, Beluga Harris employee
and a former SGA Concerts Chair,
I have found myself in this situa»
tion too many times . cleaning up
other peoples messes. At first, twas
frustrated with the apparent atti-
tude on campus that “other people"
were responsible for cleaning up our
messes. However, I unfortunately
became desensitized to the problem
and now accept it as a simple fact
oflife at Grinnell. 7

Something happened at
Dionysis, though, to shake me out
ofmy complacency. As I was picks
ing beer bottles and aluminum
cans, I remembered that April 22
was also Eanh Day, I thought back
to the ﬁrst band of the day, Natty
Nation, as they sang about Mother
Earth, about fertile lands, and about
other anvironmental themes. New
here I was about SIX hours later,
picking up other people's trash.

The worst had to be the thirty.
some cigarette butts I found scat»
tcrcd around area in the front olthe
stage. I was furious. why do some
smokers continually think the
world is their ashtray? I then had a
sad reeling of irony, remembering
that _m Insider, played at Harris
that weekend as well. I felt like
something had to be done. But
where do I start? Do I confront the
smokers by asking them why they
smoke.>Why do dney put theirhealdr
at risk? Why do they support large,
corrupt corporations that deceive
their consumers.>\Why do they drink
they can put their cigarette butts
anywhere they please? Or do I con-
front Grinnell students at large and
ask them why they do not pick up
dieir trash? Do they think that may
are so privileged'that other people
should clean up their messes.> Do
drcy have any shred oiconcern For
the environment? '

April 22 caused all ofthcse ques—
tions to bail to die surface, and so I
felt compelled to write this letter.
Hopehslly, by creating a dialogue, we
can come dose to answering some
of dtem,

Date Rape Discussion

To the Grinnell campus,

Two weeks ago “Take BaCk the
Night" was held and last Monday
Katie Koestner spoke to out came
pus about date rape, Although
Koestnet’s speech was better at.
tended, what really disturbed me
was the lack ormen present at both
functions.

The most commonly used ex-
cuse that I have heard from men is
that they feel like they will be at.
tacked tithey attend these func—
tions. I can understand this reason
ing to some extent because the is.
sues are very charged for people
emotionally. However, what really
ends up happening more often than
not is that the men who attend are
praised because they are seen as a
key agent for change to occur. Ac»
cording to Katie, 97% ofassailants
are men. As women, we can pro.
tecr ourselves and speak out as
much as we want but ifMEN don't
start talking about this issue things
will realistically never change,

I have also heard some men say
"this is a feminist issue." Tell that
to me when your sister, mom, or
girlfriend is raped. l don’t say this
as a scare tactic but the likelihood
(I in 4 women is a victim ofsexual
assault) is very high. I, along with
many other women, want more
men to show up at these functions
so drat our discussions can expand
and together we can ﬁnd ways to
solve the issue. I truly believe there
are more good men out there than
bad ones and that unfortunately the
“bad” ones are taping multiple
times and ruining many lives. For
the rcstofthe men out there, I look
to you for support. Some of my
greatest friends during my own
healing have been men. lfyou men
truly love the women around you,
start attending these functions. Prc.
pare yourselves on how you can
help women through the healing
process and better yet how you can
help to prevent taper

There are not going to be any
more “Take Back the Nights" this
year but in the future, instead of

involved now, there is also a sexual
assault committee on campus.

To the Editor:

I wanted to express my dismay
at President Osgood and how he
chooses to present himself to v
tots to campus. Last Monday when
Katie l<oestnet spoke about date
rape, president Osgood showed up
red in the race with his running
clothes on. Afterspeakingwith Ms.
Koestneraftcrher talk, she said that
she was mad when she saw his ape
pearanee, and I know that I would
have felt offended as well. in :tddie
tron, a rcw weeks ago president
Osgood came to the prospective
multicultural student formal luns
cheon in his running gear. I feel that
his appearance was disrespecttul of
Ms. Koestnerond ofall thcprospccs
trve students at the luncheon. As
president, he Is representing our
college, and the message he gives in
his running clothes is that he barely
has time to come to these unimpor.
tant events, much less wear decent
clothes. president Osgood. please
dress more professionally next time
you attend an event and appropri.
ately represent our school.

sincerely,
