U. Michigan Professor Hine
discusses African American
women’s history

 

“Historians can write a history of anything or anyone
but the key is the historian must decide that thing,
event, person or group is worthy of investigation and
apparently no one had ever thought Black women . . .
were worth studying. . . And it was as ifI entered
another universe. A universe thatI had never known
existed. And that was the beginning of my commit-
ment to telling the truth, to lifting the veil, to shat-
' tering the silence about Black women in American

history,”

m Darlene Clark Hine in her talk entitled, “Knowl-
edge and Power: Black Women’s History at the
Intersection of Culture and Power, "delivered

to tell history through the lives of
specific individuals. This method of
telling history through the lives or
speciﬁc women was

Central to the ralks the accom-
plishcd protessor of history from

before break.

“Black women must make con-
nections between the past and rhe
prescnr.. there is power in telling a
life, in examining in detail a lived life
of a speeine woman," she said.
“ [This] helps connect pasr to present
and to exrraer power from knowL
edge.”

Hine then proceeded to roll the
story ofAfrican»American cntrepre»
neur, and cx-slavc, Madam: C].
Walker. Walker, one of the three
founders of the modern black cos-
metir: industry, supported more than
100,000 people through her busi»
ness, and inspired many more to be
come entrepreneurs, “in a rimc when
they aspired to eorron ﬁelds.“ she
highlighted rhe importance or
Walker’s storysraring,“1ris a history
orhope. A hope for peoplewho need
to be inspired, ro be motivated to
continue on."

Speciﬁcally, Hine suggested that
the female role models from these
individual stories could inspire black
women of the next millennium to
enact eeonomie, political and social
Changes in dreir own lives,

Hinc concluded her talk hinting
at diis poinr stating, “In a word, in
the ncxr millennium we will use the
knowledge ofour pasr for thewomen

of pioneer...5he opens up a whole
new area of research. She‘s made us
aware rhar there are a number ofsubr
icers that historians have not dealr
with. We know little about it until
people like Darlene do the research,"
