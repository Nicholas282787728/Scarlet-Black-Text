wake up to rock ‘n’ roll again.

“Point Breeze," the ﬁrst single, is a ”Blinded
By the Light" celebration wirh handchps, “sha—
laalas” and a guirar rirrrliar will malre you wanna
do the twist wirh a goory grin on your face. “My
Heart is rhe Bums on the siren” is the record
at irs hrsr, another grear guirar rirrand a rush of
metaphors from a rhararrer who can’t srop
thinking orsomrono he once loved. “Every inch
otrhe riry," serge sings, “reminds me uryou."

Boys," serge sings, “i don't even hold the what]
when I’m driving.” You get rhe reeling

reﬂrcrive side, a celehrarory pop side and a dirty»
rilnngsido rhar all come together in a sprawl or
sliours and guirars and organs that only grear
bands can throw rogorhsr.
