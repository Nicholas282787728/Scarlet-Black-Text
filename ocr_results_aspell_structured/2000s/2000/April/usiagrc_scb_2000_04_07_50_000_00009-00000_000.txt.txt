It isn’t red. Rather, a middling bur-
gundy that gurgles intoxicatingly from
stucco ridges. Crushed maroon cher-
ries, smoothly blended. Twilight colors
that never are. A misprinted 77m: cover.
Rich, eager laterite.

Bob’s is plucked anew. Freshly
dressed. A rouge makeover. And there
is much to be questioned. Is this lusty
apple look that of Grinnell College? ls
Grinnell’s premier mffeine corner to be
commended for its color conversion?
Are you, the customer»frequenter»resi-
dent—worker—lover—petfotmet happier?

Let me, then, be die first to speak
up. I have three observations to make.

As we, Grinnell’s coffee consumers
(or the South campus halfthat doesn’t
have to walk across campus) sit back
against the worn wood, I’m beginning
to notice more than a few bodyless
heads. It’s a bit ofworry, this business
of pink being the color to wear. With
everyone’s popping up in things that
look like salmon filers to cranberry
juice these days, I’m seeing suspended
heads in the midst of Bob's all»erlcom»
passing rosy hue. Alternately, with the
Myrtle Beach returned bunch who look
more fried than toasty, there’s always
the danger of seeing headless bodiesr
Especially with the smart alecks who
shave their heads and pretend they’re
on the swim team.

Then, of course, there’s the issue of
the green pillars in the middle. Some-
times, Bob’s becomes a bit like my idea
of the inside ofan apple, Surrounded
by red skin, with a thin green core at
the center. This can occasionally be em-
barrassing; I fear the day when I start
thinking of people as the worms in the
apple, and run out screaming.

Finally, in the age ofBob’s blush, I
believe the infamous green sinking
couch will be seeing more than it can
digest. After all, “seeing red" has always
meantsomething else at Grinnell. And
what better way to be “maddened with
delight” (as a certain poet has said, most
innocently), than by the incitement of
their passions by their surroundings?
Striptease night is about to be usurped.

Nevertheless, leaf greens have been
replaced by a robust rust, and the idea
of Bob’s as a color therapist’s heaven has
been effectively replaced. The change
is a good one, and Bob’s is looking
zingier than before.

I’m only left reminded of a question,
from another poor, innocent Indian,
that lingers over Bob’s transforma-
tion. r.

“Are red-headed women red all
over. . I”

 

 

Why we don’t need SGA elections

By Dan Rothschild
Staff Columnist

Having just recently sat through
about a half dozen elections to finally
Come out with a winner was not only a
waste of time and energy, but it ended
with the campus body reaching a new
height of cynicism about SGA. But the
fact of the matter is, the elections of SGA
President and Vice President are the ves-
tiges of entrenched power which could
very easily by replaced by a more effi-
cient and democratic system.

The Grinnell SGA is the governing
body (kind of) for the 1300 or so stur
dents who attend Grinnell; in this way,
it is much like a city council. Many towns
with populations like the college’s run by
what is known as a council»manager sys»
tem, a variation of parliamentary govern»
ment. For many reasons, this would be a
much better system for us to employ

The basic premise is this: at the end
of each year, the senate hires a manager
for the upcoming year. This manager
would be responsible for many of the
duties ofthe President: holding the cabi-
net together, coordinating logistics, etc.
She would also be the only remnant of
SGA remaining over the summer, and
would likely spend the summer working
in Grinnell on SGA issues. Each semes»
ter, students would elect a senate, and
the senate would elect one of its own
members as the president of the senate.
The president would be responsible for
chairing Joint Board meetings, meeting
with the administration, and serving in
a “head of state” capacity; the manager’s
capacity would be more like a "head of
the internal executive,"

The President would, with the help

ofthe SGA manager, assemble a cabinet
out of the members of the senate and
other interested students, A films chair,
a concerts chair, and most of the other
positions we have today would be filled.
But these offlcers would hold office at
the pleasure of the senate and could be
fired by a majority vote. This makes the
cabinet accountable to the people -—
which it is currently not. The ofﬁcers of
this cabinet would be coordinated by the
manager and would report ultimately to
the senate — which reports ultimately to
the voters. Serving in the cabinet would
be asalatied job like any other, and cabi»
net officials would be expected to per-
form.

Putting power into the hands of a
cabinet which is unelected and cannot
be fired without the assent ofits own is
undemocratic and opens itself up for
endless abuses e d1is is inn system in place
today. It is little better than an dictato—
rial oligopoly of the self-designated rul—
ing class. Thus, the President would also
assemble, with the consent of the sen-
ate, a government of 5-7 senators a one
ofwhom would be selected as VP/PAA
7 that would act in the deliberative ca-
pacity that the cabinet has today. The
government would only meet, however,
to discuss issues with the administration
and to plan in a non-legislative capacity.
It would not have the vast powers that
SGA cabinets have now, which are best
put in the hands ofthe senate.

What problems does this redesign of
government solve? First, it solves for the
fact that the SGA cabinet today has far
too much power and virtually no checks
on its decisions. It is furthermore a closed
body which ostensibly represents the in»

terests ofthe students, but in reality has
no motivation to pursue anything be
yond its own self-interest. This plan
would take power from the cabinet and
return it to the elected senate, Second,
this plan solves the polarity of cabinet
and senate. The senate would be the
highest body, and the president would
be one ofits own, sitting in her office at
the pleasure of the senate. The head of
state for Grinnell College’s SGA would
thus be a senator, and not a member of
the cabinet clique. Third, this plan enr
sures that the administrative work of
SGA is taken care ofby paid profession—
als who are not involved in politics.
These would be individuals knowledge-
able in their fields who serve the carn-
pus body as its paid employees — not as
individuals operating from behind a
cloak of anonymity and virtually certain
complete job security. Finally, and per—
haps most importantly, it would elimi—
nate rhe need for a half dozen rounds of
elections which people really don’t want
and don’t need. People would only need
to vote for their senatorsr

Is this plan workable? I believe that it
is. Indeed, it is my opinion that the SGA
constitution should be abolished and re-
written under a parliamentary system as
l have detailed above, Is this plan per»
fect? Certainly not, but I believe that it
is much better than the system we have
in place now. Some issues, such as the
apprenticeship necessary for the trea-
surer, will have to be ironed out. W11 it
ever happen? That’s up to the students
of this school to decide, Think about it
and then think about how much for you
had voting every other day. It's time for
SGA to face radical reform.

Another letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

What happens when 100,000
people from all walks oflife gather in
DC to shut down the global corporate
economy’s nervous system? A move-
ment emerges!

This is the Concord of the second
American Revolution. lfit doesn’t look
like what you expecr, its because people
are organizing around multiple issues,
across national boundaries. If the tar-
gets seem big, powerful, and distant its
because corporate dominance reaches
far and wide. lfthe giant puppets and
street theater, song and dance seem un»
usual to politics, its because we are cre»
ating a new society as we shut down
the old.

The International Monetary Fund,
World Bank and WorldTrade Organi»
zation are a three headed Cerberus, the
control centers for “project globaliza-
tion”, code word for transnational cor-

porate dominance over every country
and market on the earth. IMF, World
Bank and WTO are undemocratic in-
stitutions that seek to control our food,
work, information, and lives. Under
the guise ofalleviating poverty, World
Bank and IMF loans have forced im-
poverished countries to cut social ser-
vices and basic food subsidies and turn
their economies into plantations, all to
enrich multinational corporations and
political elites. When WTO policies
force countries to compete in a race to
the bottom, wages worldwide are
driven to the floor and we all loose out.

We won the battle ofSeattle, show»
ing 135 member nations ofthe WTO
that international decisions about
worker's rights, environmental protec»
tion and consumer safety can’t be made
behind closed doors.

On April 16th, we will shut down
the meeting of the IMF and World
Bank in a mass nonviolent direct ac-

tion. A huge coalition ofinternatiorlal
organizations, the Mobilization for
Global Justice has a website,
www.416arg, which lays a foundation
for your activism. Or call 20273197
2426 for information.

We are the people and now is the
time! Democracy is a participatory
sport and we need team players » agiv
rators, educators, and organizers.

A door has been opened, and all
generations have a chance to get on the
bus and begin a new freedom ride, or
concede power to the advertising ex-
ecs and Wall Street class.

Next stop, DC! All Aboard!

Sincerely

Andrew Pearson
