a . JlM CARREY
MAN ON THE MOON

d
it?

By Courtney Hougham
(she '5 back!)
and Aaron Stockham
Staff Columnists
This is deﬁnitely the home srretch.
Courtney's presentation is in the past, so she
can now concentrate on watdiing more rhan
8 hours ofTV daily. he a tough goal to reach,
but those are the only kind ofgoals she sets.
Lets hope she can-soldier through this tough
Stretch of seniorhood. She would also like
to thank rhose ofyou who were so concerned
about her being absent from last week‘s ar-
ticle a you know who you are. Now on to
the movies.

Man on the Mann

c; i can not advocate going to see any
movie starring my least favorite actor in the

. whole world Jim catrey.

A: You should also not advocate scci rig a
movie you've never seen, but you seem to
have no problems doing that on a weekly
basis. Again, I'll have to carry rhis review,
because I acrually spend my precious rime
viewing hlms. Here we have the life story of
Andy Kaufman. Andy was a weird guy, who
we're supposed to believe was brilliant. This
runs like a Greatest Hits ofAndy movie, and
some orir works well. At the end, however,
when Andy is concentrating on defending
his World lnrencender Wrestling champi.
onship, things start to drag a little. I’m also
concerned about the lie they perpetrate,
making us believe Andy's girlfriend met him
wrestling. They actually met back stage at
Taxi. Donjt lie to us, Gus. This was obvi-
ously a talented man, but im not sure a
movie needs to be made about him quite
yet. carrey, however, was fairly convincing.
it was also a little difficult to separate DeVito
from his Taxi character when he was cast as
Andy’s agent. Eur, overall, we get a few dc-
cent laughs here. Nothing groundbreaking,
but nothing utterly crappy.

l Man an The Moon plays Friday night at
7:30 at the Observatory. Stars Jim Carrey,
Courtney "I'm not as cool as Hougham”
Love, Danny DeVito, the Cast of Taxi Di-
rectedbyGusVanSant(orsoAaran '

c: The only good thing abour this movie
would be the soundtrack by REM and how
cute Danny DeViro is.

A: The REM score wasn’t rhar good. In
faer, they only have one decent song, and
it’s not “Man on the Moon.”

c: Whatever, Aaron.

The Ratings

Jim Carrey would actually be

Daily Texan (U. Texas-Austin)

\(U-W’IRE) Last summer, The Blair
vntch Projecr tookAmerica by storm with
its innovative ﬁlm technique and the srur
pendous advertising campaign that pre.
ceded it, selling the film as a documentary
instead of the fictional story it truly was.
Naturally, there would be others trying to
mimic the success that the ﬁlm had widi
/ . . .
its alternative methods. For the publishing
world, along comes Mark Z. Danielewski’s
novel, House of Leaves.

HouseofLeaves, upon ﬁrst view, is one
of the stranger mainstream books to hit
stores in recent years. According to its pub.
lishers, it has been passed around the
inrcmcr for the last few years gaining cult
status. Loaﬁng through the pages, one can
see a whole array orfonr tires and pages
written backwards and upsidcadown.

Some have started to compare House
or Leaves to James Joyce‘s masterpiece
Finnegan's Wake, based on structure. Una
like Finnegan's Wake, rhc task of reading
this novel is hardly daunting. The [CM is
straightforward, with minor wordplays here
and there. Daniclewski's novel more closely
resembles Nabokov's Pale Fire in the Strut»
rure ofrhe actual story. Like Pale Fire, this
novel weaves in and out of two primary
terrs that ofdie character, Johnny Truanr,
and the author he is reading, the mysterir
ous zampano. Truanr, a deadbeat who
sharpens nccdles at a tatroo parlor, ﬁnds a
book called The Navrdscn Record, written
by the aforementioned Zampano, and is
consumed by the story ofa Pulitzer Prize

 

winning photographer whose house is larger
on the inside than it is on the outside.
Navidson and his family are horriﬁed to ﬁnd
a hailway leading to a series ofbigger rooms
and a never-ending staircase. The text on the
page mimics Liicsize ofrhe house, sometimes
getting larger, sometimes smaller. The reader,
as well u Truanr, is given a glimpse of the
world on the other side of the hallway
through a series of "explorations" taken by
the characters in the interior novel.

Unlike many contemporary horrornov»
cls, the characters actually begin to develop
a life of their own. Just as the actors' pro-
jected fear in The Blair Witch Project gave
the film life, so do the anxieties ofrhe char-
acters in this novel. Danielewski creates char.
acters whose actions can be predicted, bur
are wonderfully executed. in the “outer”
novel, we sec JohnnyTruants gradual break
down as he reads this book.

In the ﬁrst pan of the novel, Truanr's
character isn’r given as many dimensions as
some of the olhcr characters. This is rem-
edied by the appendices to the book, which
contain a hcanawrenching serics ofletrtrs
written by Truant’s mother from an insane
asylum some coded, some in limerick. We
see her go from “mommy" to ”mom" to sim—
ply T" as she slowly loses her mind from
abuse in rhc hospital. While to some, these
appendices may seem fruitless because ofa
needless quote section and some pictures.
rhey give the reader a greater insight into
Danielewski's main character.

The page layouts often mirror the text.
At one point, Navidson is climbing a ladder
and the reader is able to climb with him

Book Review: House of Leaves

through the text that begins at the bottom
ofrhe page and works its way up. While dicse
innovations do make the novel even more
inrerrextual than it‘ already is, some of
Danielewski’s novelties are more annoying
than eifective.

On virtually every page, there are foot-
notes rhar reference either actual texts or
imagined texts that deal with The Navidson
Record. Although diey do bring a certain
aspect of acruality to the novel, the reader
merely needs to turn to rhe cover to be re»
minded rhat rhis is a work omction.

House aibeaves is a horror novel, but it
does have its humorous moments, most at
the expense ofliterarycriricism and psychol-
ogy, Like Pale Fire, this novel mocks the de.
grees criticism can reach. The straighrforr
ward plot is skewed and distorted by fictional
critics who find more in the characters ac
tions than actually appears. Danielewski
pokes fun at ridiculous psychological cririr
cism at several points. Many ofrhe hctionai
papers being referenced define the growth
of the house as a reflection of the psycho»
logical states ofrhe characters, even though
in the area ofrhe novel, this is clearlya para»
normal efrect.

The success oiThe Blair Witch Project
relied on a gimmick, and rho same could
easily be said for House ofLeavcs. But the
unorthodox layout of the novel does not
mask bad writing. Danielewski's debut is
promising. Like blairWitch, it is a work to
be cnioyed by those who believe in its inr
rrinsic rruth. As much as rhar trudi mayap-
pear lost, the unique and rewarding style of
his prose is not.
