Titans final drive adds thrill to
Superbowl for Grinnellians

Mall Lorenz
Staff Writer

Nothing like the Superbowl to bring
Gtinnellians together over common inter-
ext. Well, maybe not quite. But whether
you‘re a true fan, an anthropologist of
American culture, or just looking for an
excuse for cheap beer and pigs»in».r»lrlnrr-
ket, doli‘t'be ashamed to succumb to the
spit-it of this Greet Aiiieiican Event, "the
people's grime," according to the sports
unnaunccrs.

For those ofyou who nrc rcniiy out of
the loop, supcrhowi XXXIV happened Inst
Sunday evening, the Tennessee Titans vs.
the st. Lortis Rams,21t the Georgia Dome
in Atlanta.

Andy Nelson ‘00 watches
Superbowl to be a part of its "collective
culture." "It's a national pastime. You know
what the majority ofAmerica is doing right
now. . . . 1 Want to be 2 part oithcrt," He

the

compares the Superbowl phenomenon to
the Hindi ﬁlms shown every Saturday at 2
in Nepal. Everyone gets into it, whether
the film itselfis good or bad, Lauren Mur-
rrn '02 watches the end of the game, be-
cause ”it‘s the biggest quarter of the big
gesl game ofthe season, and it's exciting."

This year's final quarter was particularly
exciting, According to Perry Gordon '00,
"Even ifyou're not a superrfan, you‘d be
interested" in this game, because "every-
one was on the edge oftheirseat the whole
time," St Louis won 23-16, but it came

down to Tennessee being tackled about 2
yards from the end zone in the last few sec»
onds. "That was the most fun game to
watch since the San Francisco 49ers heat
the Broncos," says Gordon, a 49ers Fan.
Russ Motta, campus security, pointed out
how the Titans could have had a good start
“ifnot for all the screwed-up ﬁeld goals."

But enough of this sports ttiViarwhat
was really marvelous about the event was
the halftime sliowl Ask anyone who saw it,
and see her or his eyes light up with the
wonder ofits weirdness. Phil Collins was
the big-name entertainer, but he was
dwarfed by some huge generic-god-type
figure looming in the background, along
with a dizzyingly motley assortment of
costumed ﬁgures and other musicians.
There were billowy-hooped-white ﬁgures,
headdresses, and large marionettes, in ad»
dition to respectable oboe and violin play»
ers, all part ofa misguided millenial theme,
as far as can be ascertained.

Halftime show rhetoric was supplied by
an occasional cut to the ﬁgure of distin»
guished actor and activrst Edward James
Olmos (identiﬁed by Vivek Venugopal
'00), who solemnly proclaimed profundi»
ties something like "the gateway of time
has opened i . , a voice from every land , .
. reyorce in the tapestry of magic . , . wait
no longer, the time is now" No respect-
able person with halfa brain could have in
complete seriousness been the voice ofsuch

lutely nonsensical spectacle.

The music, too, sang of "two worlds,
one family.“ I don't know to what worlds
they were referring, but they seemed to
have utter faith in the power of the
millenial halftime to make our global Vii,
lage forget petty differences in the face or
what really counts: the worldwide accesslv
biliry and values otWestern entertainment.

Other parts ofthe event had a less bet
wildering weirdness, like when there were
men with kilts and bagpipes while Faith
Hill sang the national anthem, There was
also a kid contingent doing some sort of
signing along With the anthem, and ahuge
flag, more torbe-expected symbols ofour
values.

The commercials, too, made more
sense: they entertained in pursuit ofproﬁt.

My favorite was when the FedEx truck
landed on the Wicked Witch of the East,
rushing to supply helium to the Lollipop
Guild whose voices were deepening as they
tried to ﬁnish their jaunty little song. Also
good was an EDS e-business ad of cow—
boys herding cats. There were some com-
munity-service ads too, against smoking
and for the United Way. Regis Philbin
seemed to have a pervasive presence in ads.

Yes, Superbowl xxxtv was another set»
isfyingspectaele ofnonstop entertainment
and cultural commentary, whether it was
the game itself, the ads, or pregame and
