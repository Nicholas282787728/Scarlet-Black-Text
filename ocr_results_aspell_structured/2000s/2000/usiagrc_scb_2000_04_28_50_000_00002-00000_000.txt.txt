EARYH WEEK PANE FAmi AND m: ENVIRONMENI

One of the Earth Week events sponsored
by EAG was a panel on Faith and the Envir
ronment, in which a Jewish, aVChristian
and a Muslim speaker talked about envi-
ronmentalism from a religious perspective
Although the texts or these faiths each see
humans as superior or central within their
surroundings, this superiority comes with
certain responsibilities to the Earth, the
speakers suggested.

"The students who came to the presen-
tation were clearly well versed in environs
mental concerns and politics and interested
in the role that religious traditions might
piayr'rr these criticalissues," Rabbi Deborah
Erin, one of the event participators, said,

"Despite our theological and religious
differences," Erin said, "the three of us
share a clear understanding that religious
communities and traditions can have an
important role to play in educational and
social action efforts that enhance the via
ability or our habitat and protect the amaz-
ing (some would say miraculous) gift or
life on this earth,"
