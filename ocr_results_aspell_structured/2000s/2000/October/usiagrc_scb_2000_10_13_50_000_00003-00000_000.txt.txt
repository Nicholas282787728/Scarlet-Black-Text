the panel's discussion or class size
gradually mutated into a barger debate,
one that seemed to address almost all
collegespending, Following comments by
several students on the removal oian RLC
and dean position and a discontinued
senior debt relief program, trustees and
students iound themselves wrestling with
the longcterm goals and purpose of the
institution.

While the college is cutting these
“academic, social, and healthful" corners,
Bridie Roberts '01, said, ”we're building a
new Darby with climbing walls. And that
kind of disturbs me."

trustees on the committee on rinancial
Aid Policy said they were not aware or the
closing at a senior debt reliei progmm,
hut agreed that it was not good "to
eliminate programs, unless they're
programsthataren'tservinganyparticular
purpose.”

Commenting on the tilt elimination
(according to Student Services RLC John
Mounsey, no dean positions had in tact
been eliminated), harr said, "I think it’s

we don't superinse employment, were
concerned vinth the sort or overall issues.
We rely on recommendations irom the
administration and the faculty. this gives
us some pretty good question
ammunition.”

"We don't have a billion dollars
anymore," Sebnng tontinued. "We can't
iust keep spending it. rou can do the
math . .. ityourbudgets going to increase
by a certain amount then your endowment
has to grow. . . the average student pays
about $9000 dollars here. it is hard to
balance these things, but there are not
unlimited resources . . . We would have
another stream of resources it our alumni
would become more generous on a regular
basis. Compared to other colleges, we're
kind of fair-to.middlin:"

"To me, our priority should he student
life and education tirst," responded
Roberts. "i remember when the Master Plan
came out, I remember when our new
president came here, I remember all the
changes that started happening after that
,. . when i find out that my aid doesn't
count, I become very disturbed."

 

\Qair to say that we don’tsee it as ourioh

 

Several students spoke on behali oi the
Grinnell College [halntzrrm an
organization for Jewish students, to
express concern over the tate oi retiring
professor Harold Kasimows seat in the
Religious Studies department. kasimow,
who specializes in Jewish and Muslim
traditions, will be tentatively replaced by
the department with a professor
specializing in a different tradition.
"this loss has farcreaching implications
tor the student body and community" the

 

”-5 I'

group wrote in a memo distributed to the
trustees.

oescn'bing the importance to Gn'nnell's
Jewish community of having uppetclevel
classes on Judaism as well as their value
to noncJews, thalutzim spokespersons
called for the trustees "to create a position
that would retain Judaic studies as a
meaningiul and significant element of the
Religious Studies curnculum," possibly by
creating a new position or by opening a
Judaic studies interdisciplinary study. /

 

 

the one issue directly raised by a
trustee during the panel session was
introduced by lowry in the meetings last
ten minutes. he had been troubled, he
explained, by a dearth oi crinnell
applicants to husiness school. "ooes
Grinnell even encourage anybody to know
about business, and know about the power
of business, and encourage our students
to go into business?” he asked,

Ben Brofnlati "03, was quick to answer
lowry ”r thinkthat we know how poweriul
it is, it’s just that we want to take that
power back to use it for ourselves," h
said smilingly.

Other trustees and some students
concurred with lowry. "What this country

 

needs hadly are more people who are
running companies who come out of places
like Gnnnell. It's not gonna happen by law
a . a it's going to happen becausewe have
a cultural change in which partotourvalue
system are this who think not only about
the investor [but] those who also invest
eiiort In our companies," said Henderson,
who descnbed himseli as surpnsed by his
own recent move to running a husiness.

AS time expired tor the meeting, white,
a writer just beginning his practice of law,
agreed. at liie lasts a long time, and a
cateet,.. ought to involve contributing to
your community contributing to society
in a lot of diiierent ways."

the hrst question asked the trustees,
aiter a hriei introduction irom each
panelist. dealt with a perceived need ior
more students, iaculty and staff at color
in coming years. Four students expressed
concern over a lack oi sp ﬁc coliege
policies, over the admissions ofﬁce's need
ior more support, and over changing
admissions practices in a state with
increasing internahonal immigration.

All trustees that spoke on the issue
acknowledged a campuswide desire tor
greater diversity oi hentage and agreed
that further action needed to be taken.

”I think there's been some frustration
among the board, the students, the
faculty, that things have not moved as
iast as we would like," said Sebnng in
opening. She cited increasing numbers
oi Airicamhmericans from Grinnell’s
reinstated thicago admissions delegation
as a sign at hope. "Diversity,” she added,
however, "is not really a question of
numbers, it's a question of mindset."

Matty trustees added their own words
to this effect, saying that students and
alumni shared a responsibility to promote
diversity. ”We have to have an
environment here on campus where we
can all pick up the phone and feel good
about inviting people [to visit]," said
trustee Jim lowry ’61.

"this is a community that is probably
as egalitarian as you can find," said
trustee craig henderson. "the students
play a very maior role."

todd linden, who operates Gnnnell

Regional Medical Center, cited the
hospitals 25% minority employment
rate~in a state with a 3% non-white
population—as a possible reservoir of
persons of color to showcase Grinnell’s
possihilities. ”We need to get the college
community and the medical community
to learn to work together,“ he said.

in the first or a number of
characterizations of himself as a newcomer
to the board, White said, "This is a little
nervesracking ior me, because it wasn't
veny long ago thatr was on the other side,
yelling at the trustees " ,

"there's nothing that I am going to say
that will prove salisrying to the skeptics
in the crowd, because the trustees don't
operate likethat," he continued. Notonly
would ”throw[ing] money at the problem"
not solve the problem, he explained, the
board does not have the power to thmw
that money. "We advise, vie enable, we
set the boundaries, and we hold people
accountable.”

Probed again tor speciiic proposals,
White spoke for the panel by laying out
six initiatives tor the coming years:
Grinnell’s Chicago represenlation, both as
an instrument and as a prototype for future
nationwide programs; engaging alumni in
similar pursuits across the country;
engaging faculty in prospective-student
phoning diives; changes in the office of
admissions, such as new multicultural
coordinator Lisa Alexander ’97; bringing
more minority students to campus; and
increasing financial aid programs.

ton' Zagarell’oo, visiting from New track
as a guest of Students AgainslSweaLshops,
discussed the possibility that Grinnell's
bookstore solo clothing made under poor
labor conditions. Joking "what in about
to say may in fact be all ot your fault
because you've encouraged [transparency
and accountability] at Grinnell," she
advocated the college's withdrawal from
the Fair lahor Association and entry into
the Worker Rights Consortium.
Henderson acknowledged a sense oi
urgency in this campaign, saying that the
issue would he dealt with atthe nextday's
board meeting. he warned, nonetheless,
that board memhers did not like to make
decisions nn'thout careful consideration,
"None oi you in this room blindly iollow
leaders," he said, commending zagarell

and others for taking leadership hut sayn‘ng\

that he and other new members needed
time to frilly explore the issue.

While nodding to the question's
importance, lowry compared the current
anti-sweat eiiort to previous campaigns
by Grinriellians against migrant-worker
mistreatment or South African apartheid.
"We should not stop here," he warned. "too
otten we deal with one issue and that takes
paramount concern, and thats our whole
iocus,.. andtherearestill migpnt workers
in California.”

White also expressed concern over the
sweatshop problem, but mentioned recent
articles in the New York times and utne
reader that warned of regulations to which
writ members might be subjected.

Kate Wolf '01, led SEVEGI students in
expressing concern over unwieldy class
sizes, noting that the student initiative
irom on year that passed by the oddest
margin called for an increase in the
college’s faculty. Grinnell’s 10-1 student-
oculty ratio, she argued, compared poorly
to those of peer institutions and relied
heavily upon several very small classes in
certain departments.

Crowding, and iaculty ovenwork, may
be compounded, she said, by the new
Mentored Adranced Projects (or
Capstones), “The tact of the matter is that
while MAP: are a wonderfulidea and they
really help a lot of people . . . its creating
a further strain on the fdtully,” Wolf
explained. ”Seniors are in seminars with
over 40 people."

"Myinitial response when i got on the
board was . . . we need some new iaculty,
lets get some new bculty," remembered
White. ”It’s not that easy. If; not forthe

\ttuStees to go out and say, ’Darnmit, we

need more iaculty, lets get more iacul
what we do do is ask questionS to oculty
and administrators that are in the meeting
and say, What’s the deal? iiihat can you do
about this?" we are taking this iniormation
seriously. . . but we take as much as we
give irom iaculty and administrators."
Specific problems with the frequent
closingscoul in the studio art department

.were also raised, and students reminded the

trustees that large class size not only
adversely afietis those in classes, butthose
who are closed out at them,

closing debate on the issue, Wolf further
recalled her experience, ‘the initiative was
passed last spring . . . t and several other
students made seveml suggestions to the
administration," she said, "one which
involved speciiic sources of money that
could he used in hiring faculty and others
which did not involve any money, but simply
investigating the situation farther, and to
my knowledge none of these have been
carried out. i find this very disturbing."
