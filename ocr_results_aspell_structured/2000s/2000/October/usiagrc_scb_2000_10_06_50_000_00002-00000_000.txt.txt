0. WHERE is THE ENDOWMENT
GOING?

A. to the UCs!

UCs (user consultants) make $7.20 an
hour to sit in a lab and surf the net. USE
THEMl its not FAIR that they, the "trained
workers”, get megarbucks for doing
nothing. ASK THEM QUESTIONS! That‘s what
theyre there for:

cant open a ﬁle? Ask a 0:!

Printer not working? Get a uc to hx it!
Need attention? so ask a uc how to change
your password: (Not recommended when
the DC is actually busy.)

Do not be afraid to approach them. An
orange hag does not turn a human into an
intellectual ogre. ucs aren't any smarter
than you are. They've just been trained.
While this makes some ue pretentious, it
doesn‘t make any of them mean.

~tt you see a lit who is listening to

headphones, report them.

-If you see a us doing homework, report

them.

-If a uc is unusually gnttt with you or

acts unwilling to help, report them.

they are not doing their job and SHOULD
not be making $7.20 an hour. You can
report Us by sending an email to
uc@gtinnell.edlt. You don't have to name
names. Just say what time it happened and
what tab the U: was in. Filling out a
comment card in the bah also works. You
can use either of those means or
communication to report good things you '
see in the lab.
