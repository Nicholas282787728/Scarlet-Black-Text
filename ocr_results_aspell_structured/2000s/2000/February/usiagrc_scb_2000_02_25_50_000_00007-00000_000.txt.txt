By Mclli Lorenz

The town of Giinncll has two
high schools: the Grinncll High
School, and the New Horizons AI-
ternativc High School The sehoo :
tliiter quite a hit in number orstiir
dents, resources, structiiie and phi-
losophy. Most community members
don’t have a solid idea ofwhat New
Horizons is about. Reﬂecting this
misunderstanding, some inﬂamma.

class were recently postLd on the
school‘s web page.

to share on the “Students Sound Oi?"
web page. Three shorr essays on the

According to her, “The school
shouldn't be providing a platform for
students to segregate themselves,"

The opinion essays expressed re.

privileges and “special treatment"
that New Horizons students have,
Onc claimed that a diploma from
New Horizons does not have the Va»

not graduate with the GHS students,
It asserted, “Going to the alternative
school has Just been an excuse for
many people who don't want to try
harder at a real school.”

Another essay said that New Ho»
rirons students will probably end up
in ynil, and “will piobahly be work-
ing in a Factory tor the rest or their
lives and chances are high that they
won't even need a diploma."

Wagner understands why the
New Horizons srarrwas upset, and
she has acknowledged that the “stu—
denrs sound Off” web page may not
be rhe proper avenue tor sharing
opinions. The purpose ortlie page is
being reconsidered and it may he re-
moved. its Wagner points out, how
ever, “\When there are people that
disagreewirh other people, we some»
times stirle it," and she suggests that
these ideas need to come out into the
open.

New Horizons would like the op
portunity to inform more people
about who they area They have about

“There are as many reasons {or

“There‘s a deep miseonceprion about
this school, what it does, who it
serves, and how it serves than-la People
often matte judgements just based on
snippets ofinfo." She sees her main
purpose as teaching the students to
be better human beings. This goal is
seen in the maturityorthcir response
to the remarks made against them.
Differences such as the length of
lunch and the New Horizons policy
ornotmovingon untila‘ls.’hasbeen
earned in a class seem unfair to many
GHS students. one way to approach
this is to question is whether these
advantages should then be taken
away, or whether they are a better
system that should be applied more
broadly in the school district,

"Thisistverystroiigcommunity
here, and it's what maltes kids want
to keep coming back. it’s also very
noii-iudgmental," according to
Francis. “we talk [to students] about
consequences of choices; that’s our
focus I feel pretty passionate about
the kids in this program. I find my
self in the position often or being
highly protective of them This is a
discnhanchised group orltids, so it’s
easy to be simplistic and say that
whatever_thcy’r= doing must not be
worthwhile."

Wagner hopes that some bcncﬁt
will come out otrhc controversy as
GHS students find out more about
New Horizons.

Changes in mental health discussed

Rikhei Harris
Slalf Wriler

The committee for the review of mental health
services had its ﬁrSt meeting today As Stated in
the meetings agenda, the purpose oFthis com-
mittee is to ”make recommendations to insure
that services are meeting the psychological needs
oioiir students," Effectively, what this means is
that the committee will be examining the role of
the Residence Life program and the role of the
Powcshcik County Mental Health Center iii of-
fering counseling and psychological services to
Grinnell students.

The committee is made up orstiidents, staff,
and faculiy, as well as a representative from the
Mt‘ntul Health center, At the meeting, each or
them brought a dirierenr light to the current prob-
lems surrounding mental health services,

Steve Larson gave a brief history of the RLC
program. In the past, the ﬁrst goal ol‘the th
program was io sarisl‘y counselling needs on cam—
pus However, in the last several years, the re-
soiiiee base has shifted Most people who have
gone through counselling training are not inter-
ested in strident afﬂuis. Thosc who are interested
in student affairs must go through rigorous pro
grams in order to gain counselling certiﬁcation,

One question that arose was whether the RLCs
were being pushed beyond their bounds, An—
other question that was mentioned brieﬂy was
whether the RLC program is suffering For the loss

it took lastyear when one ofthe posi one was elimi»
noted. The main problem with the RLC program,
however, is that students don't know exactly what
the role ofthe RLC is.

An interesting point brought up by Pip Gordon
was that Grinnell’s geographic isolation and academic
intensity have a profound effect on the mental health
of students. While one View seemed to focus on
what students need in terms of mental health ser-
vices and counselling, Pip felt that preventive mea-
sures were also necessary to insure the mental health
of Grinnell students.

len Ktohn will be gathering data via suivcys sent
to peer institutions as well as students who do and
do not use the Mental Health Center, The commit-
tee also expressed interest in student feedback, stat-
ing that the sooner they got Feedback, the sooner
they could work it into their review, They also dis
cussed the possibility oiliolding an open forum later
in the semester to gather more student Feedback.
They will be submitting their recommendations to
Ptesidcnt Osgood at the end oftltc semester, though
they do not know ilrhcir recommendations will be
put into effect for next year or not.

il‘you would like to submit Feedback on the cf»
fectiveness of the RLC program and the Mental
Health Center in fulﬁlling the needs ofGrinnell Stu»
dents, please contact one ofthe members ofthe com-
mittee, either by e-mail or anonymously through
campus mail.
