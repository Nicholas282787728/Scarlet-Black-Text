Carroll, court from p. 1

Grinnell is that selfegovsrnzlncc pcrmcatct
every aspect ortiie campus... we‘re not con—
strained unnecessarily," said Carroll. “The
Mentored Advanced Project won't constrain
students... [it will} .ust offer students more
chances to express themselves academically,"

One issue mentioned in Carroll’s state-
ment of intent was the need to recruit high.
quality tenured professors. In Wednesday‘s
interview, Carroll elaborated on that point.

“There’s a danger in just filling quotas,
getting faculty members that are just here for
a year," he said. “It's much better for the
school to have a quality, tenured professor
than to have 10 different professors over 10
years."

Carroll is cautious on the Subject ofthe
election bylaw changes being considered by
SGA. “Some of the Ideas are sound," he said,
“but people need to kccp in mind that the
situation that occurred this year will prob
ably not happen again for a very long time."

In addition, he said, the right to abstain
should be protected: “Choosing to abstain,
not vote, and write in are all options of de-
mocracy."

At one point during the election cycle,
there was speculation that ifno prcsidcnrwas
chosen, Carroll might become president by
default, In that event, Carroll explained, “I
would have continued in the role of Presi-
dent of Academic Afﬁirs and there would
have bccn an election for a new vice presi.
dent who would handle the president’s du-
(“35,"

However, Carroll said he was never scri-
ously worried about the possibility,

When asked what he saw as the most imp
portant issue facing the college, Carroll said
that Grinnell, like the rest of the world, is
moving into a technological age‘r .

\Vlll the Grinnell campus by environmene
tally friendly in the future? will it be stnsi.
tive to multicultural issues? Will it he a place
where everyone feels welcome? Decisions
made in the next few years, Carroll said, will
have major ramifications in the future.

“We’re writing, right now, the blueprint
for the Future of Grinnell College," he said.

Flammer, cont. from p. 1

Flammer, the senator from Langan, said he sees SGA’s president
as “a noneblascd listener” whose job is to facilitate discussion or is-
sues, make sure important questions get asked, and make sure both
sides ofevery story arc hcard.

When asked win“ he would change about SGA, Flammcr ice
sponded that SGA’s role needs to be better known on Campus, “The
most important thing about stir-governance is that pcoplc huvc to
know how it works and what it is,” he said, “I wzlnt m be the presie
dent, I Want to he in the cabinet, that helps create that.”

Flammet proposed aggressively publicizrng SG/l's role ut the bee
ginning of the year, especially to new students SGA is “truly a
grassroots organization," he said, and more people need to become
involved.

In last weeks 5673, Plummet said one of his goals was to get the
president of SGA on the Board ofTrustees. (Currently. student inc
volvcment in the trustees' dccisions is limited to one meeting where
the president and viceeprcsidcnt ofSGA report to the board on stu-
dent issues.) However, Flammer conceded that full student rcprc»
scntation might not be possible.

“I would like student representation on the Board othustces,"
he said, “I realize the members ofthe Board ofTrusrecs would have
reservations about that, and I understand theirstde orthc argument,
but 1 still think it's important to do."

Flammer came into the SGA spotlight when, immediately after
the Elections Board declared the runoff betwccn Rachel Melts and
Sherman Willis invalid, he proposed a sweeping set ofchangcs to
SGA’s clcction bylawsr onc of Flammer‘s changes appears headed
for Joint Board approval, another was struck down, and Flammcr is
withdrawmg the third.

Libel became an issue in (he first round of elections, when the
Elections Board ruled that Rachel Melis' statement ofinttnt violated
SGA rules against negative campaigning. Under Flamincr's changes,
which were approved almost unanimously last week, Melis' stare.
ntcnt would nor have violated SGA rules, since it did not legally
constitute slander.

Joint Board did not approve Hammers suggestion that SGA im»
pose limits on campaign spending, “People thought it was llmlting
to candidates creativity,“ rlammcr said. “From what I saw from my
constituents, people seemed to be in favor orit, . but that's okay As
long as people are talking about it, then we're moving in the right

direction."

initially, Flammcr had proposed barring writein candidates from
participating in son elections, on the grounds that writceins could.
it they so desired, violate election rules with impunity. However,
many senators kit that eliminating writc.ins would deprive students
ofcholcc.

Artct discussing the changes with Mciis, who is also a member or
Joint Board, Flamrncr decided to pull thewritcein ban before it came
to a vote. Flammcrsnld he and Melis agreed that wtitc.in candidatcs
should have to follow the same rules as tycryone clsc, but that they
should not be banned altogether,

Flammct won the March 16 election with a 27-point lead over
secondplace finisher Bridle Robctts, but he said the 17.2 percent
abstention rate poses a problem for him,

"One ofthe biggest challenges is the 17.2 percent who felt that l
was completely incompetent," hc said. “Hopefully they’ll give me
and George [Carroll] and the new cabinet a shot, and I think we'll
change their minds."

“1 think [the abstentions] wcrc people with a lack orconfidcnce
in the candidates," he said. “There were a few pcoplc who were do»
ing it to have fun”. tiiats going to happcn in a democracy, and that's
okay..-. or maybe they thought George Carroll should be president."

Flammerspecultted that hissupport came from pcoplcwlio knew
him and rclt he could do the job, people who read his statement of
intent and agreed with most ofhis positions, and people who simply
wsntcd to end the election process, ,

Flammcr said he had no plans to run for president in the first
round of elections, but was convinced to enter the race after three
elections tailcd to produce a winner. In itct, Flammer hsd originally
planned to go abroad with the GrinncllelneLondon program next
semester, but cancelled after he was elected. “It’s more important for
thc students for me to do this," he said,

Despite rhc lack ofstudcnt confidence Flammer expects to face,
he secmcd to be looking forward to the challenge oibctng sons ncxr
president, He also looks rorward to working with George Carroll,
the vice President and president of/‘icademic Affairs.

“This presidency is deﬁnitely a difficult one, because or all the
turmoil that went on" during the first round of elections, Flammcr
said, “I lust hope we'll be successful, and create a better unity on
campus, and spread the love."

New face of Grinnell?

Change, cont. from p. 1

ofa push for radicalism as I assume there
used to be." He also speculated as to the
cause: “with the economy as good as it is it
doesn't pay to be a radical,.. or it becomes
more mainstream to be involved in change.
You don’t have to write on a bathroom wall,
you can iust start‘a group up and get funded.”

“There’s a feeling among seniors that
there aren't as many activists among under-
classmen.... A lot or my friends say that
walking around campus, the campus looks
different," said Amy Glieken '00.

“There are definitely a lot more
Abercrombie and Fitch shirts around," said
Mike Chang ’01.

Brooke Fambtaugh '01 was more em.
phatic. ”The image of the school is more
important than the school itself. All the
things that the school is based on and all the
things that wete good about the school are
going downhill because we’re trying to build

up this image."

Several students expressed concern over
a dccreasing ratio ofllumaniricseleaning slut
dents to sciencedeaning students; admissions
data did not show any signiﬁcant trends in
extracurriculatactivities, though biology has
recently surpassed English as the most com»
mon intended malor among matriculants.

others were highly skeptical orthe exist.
ence ofa “new Grinnell."

“1 think it’s a myth that resurrects itself
cvcry year as a ncw and bitter senior class
decides that the world isn't what it used to
be," said Andrew Derksen '00, “The New
Grinnell' Huh? I don‘t think so."

Mauik Patel ’01 also criticized the
phrase, saying, “I don't see how by writing
something it represented a Grinncll chance
rot, and since I don’t know what that cliarac»
tcr ls, I don’t know if that character has
changed. I cannot see what character there
is in writing on a wall."

Sexual Assault Awareness

7 Most faculty members expressed
moderatc opinions. “I think Grinncll has
changed somewhatwhile I've been here, but
these changes have been slow, gradual, and
the product orchanges in the larger society,"
said Don smith ofthe history department.

Laura Sinett, an associate profcs-
sor of psychology, refers Grinnellians to a
sentence from their viewbook that she called
“effectively a mission statement."

“'Grinnell graduates should b uipped
to pursue succcssful careers, sari ng per-
sonal lives, effective communitysetvicc, and
intellectually satisfying and physically active
leisure.’

“It seems like intellectual satisfaction'
and physical active leisure are given short
shritt," concluded Sincrr. “We seem to be
taking ourselves more seriously than we used
to, Everywhere lr'siless time rot fun."
