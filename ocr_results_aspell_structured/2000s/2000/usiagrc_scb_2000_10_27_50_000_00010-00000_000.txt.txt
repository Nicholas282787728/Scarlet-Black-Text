To rhe ediror‘and readers,

I read rhe article by Dan Rorhsehild and had a very posie
rive reaenon ro his message. Nor only are we living in an era in
which replacing and nor repairing is rho norm, bur reryeling
rarher rhar reusing has bccomc more polirieally correct, even
when environmenrally ineorreer.

l srudied ar Grinncll from 1973 rhrough ro my degree in
May 1977. At rhar rime, mosr or us had come from a fairly
srrong anri.war baekground. we had ro regisrer roi rhe drarr
and when we eame ro crinnell. many orus had burned our
diatr eards. we learned rhar Grinnell srudems had eaused rhe
demise orrhe ROTC program and building on eampus.

A direcr side errecr ro rhe and—war seiirimenr was a hack
rerbasics lifesryle, we rried re use only produers which had nor
caused :nvironmcmal and or human damage as a resulr ofrheir
manuraerure. we were inreresred in farmer overalls and shop.

They were not hippies
and they were not
college dropouts, they
were farmers, and they

for generations which
were, in essence, the
working model of what
we were trying to

whieh were, in essenee, rhe working model orwhar we were

There was a Red wing Boer srore in downrown Grinnell

Ah, bureaucracy. You know 1 love it. Instead or
voting at the. satellite voting center this Wednesday,
I decided that 1 wanted an absentee ballot because
my vote would count for more in Illinois. Unfortu-
nately, the powers-thatrbe were rather, um, ”stupid”
is a good word.

First, they tried to dissuade me rrom getting a ballot
when I called. Then, they sent me a thoroughly point.
less ballot request form instead of assuming that the

’fact I’m calling them is a fairly good indication that 1
want one. And now I'm going to have to fill out es-
sentiallyrhe same form when the actual ballot comes.

Why in the name or God do they do it like this? It’s
a pain roi me, it’s more work for them, and it’s a ilae
grant‘waste of paper. And then people wonder why
voter turnout is so low.

' —Bmd Houston

let me state right off that I ﬁnd no fault in rants
ing. 1 merely feel the need to restore the karmic bal-
ance of the Random Rants. So, i am contributing
this: a random anti-rant. Mostly, I want to list a
bunch of the things i appreciate. For instance, the
word “plump." Say it a few times, and don‘t think of
turkeys. It's just such a satisfying word. And ice
cream sprinkles. As long as we're talking food, I am
very thankful for the returned/new bagel slicer
(Cowles). Just the invention of the bagel slicer is a
wonderful thing. I don't have a lot or experience
with waffle makers, but someone likes them enough
to take one from Cowles, so i guess that‘s a pretty
impressive contraption, too. So the next time you’re
growing plump eating your sprinkles, bagels, and

wafﬂes, be thankful! ‘

Things that could be changed:

- Everyone loves chips and salsa. As you all
know the chips at Northern or Southern are 159
and the salsa is 2.49. Every time you have a crave
ing for chips and salsa, you can never have both
at the same time. Waiting two days is just too
much of a struggle for such a craving that could
easily be satisfied,

thing from Gates ﬁrst, please just leave it there
so everyone can enjoy it. Is everyone as lame as
I am?
