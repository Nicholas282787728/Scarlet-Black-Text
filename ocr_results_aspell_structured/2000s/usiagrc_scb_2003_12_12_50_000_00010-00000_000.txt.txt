Caucus How 0

0' Wilen Eve the Iowa caucuses?

A: ihey'rethe night oiJan. 10, the iirstday oiclasses
ior next semester The Democratic caucus locations
willhavetheirdoorsopenby p.m.andthecaucus
will start by 7. The Democratic caucus in the 1st ward
which contains Crinnell's campus and most oi its
students, is usually really big, and it could last until
9 or 9 o. The other wards' Democratic caucuses should
be quicker. The Republicans don't have any times
worked out ior certain yet.

0: where do they take place?

A: Crinnell has tour wards, one in each corner at the
city. The college campus is in the 1st Ward and the
Democratic and Republican caucuses ior that ward

ate in Fairvievl Elementary, time blocks east of’

campus on Eighth Avenue,

students who live oﬁ‘campux, though, could be in one
o/tho other words, See the mop on p. 12.

The 2nd Ward site is Bailey Rark Elementary School
on the corner oi Eighth Avenue and Reed Street. The
3rd Ward site is the Carman Center, inside the
Mayflower Health Center at 600 Park Stleet. The 4th
Ward site is Davis Elementary School between Main
and eroad streets on Hamilton. And one tricky thing
ahuut the ward divisiuris: note that streets are divided
between wards at their center lines. For example,
you're in the first ward it you live on the east side oi
Main Stleet between Sixth Avenue and 11th Avenue
but you're in the and Ward it you live on the west
side oi Main Street between those streets.

0: How can students register tor the caucus? Do they
have to be registered beiorehand.7

A: Vou can do everything on the night oithe caucus.
Assuming you're a 0,5. citizen, all you have to do to
register ior a caucus is prove that you're yourseli,
that you'll be 18 by Nov. 2 and that you live in the
area. Acurrentdn‘veis license and a studentTD should
be enough. Even it you've registered already, there‘s
a chance you won't be on the list at the caucus site,
so you should bring your IDs iust in case.

0: Does that mean 1 can't vote in my home state's
primaries?

A: ies. If you do sign up at a caucus you will
immediately become a citizen oi Giinrlell, Iowa and a
member oi the appropnate party. That won't aiiect
