Rest with a pigtailed baby. it's Wednesday morn—
ing, and customers ask her about the elections. In
the afternoon, Saint's Rest will serve more students
than any other group of people. but right now most
of the customers are over 40.

to linger and talk after work."

Waitressing 20.25 hours a week helped
cart land othetjobs such as babysitting and
taking eare of a garden. “It’s easy to get to
know people in the eommunity," she said.

All three employees have stories about the ehar.
aeters they meet. “During the summer, there was
this little older woman who would eome in with
her dates and order a seoteh and water and a

bloody hamburger," Carr
said. “We’d try to give her

Obviously, Frazict's iohs show her dttretent
sides or the town, “The MeNally's regulars :ic
more famllyemlenled,” she said. “At the Pub, it's
a different group. You don‘t know people's names,
you eall them by their drinks."

A! the Pub, Frazier's had to break up a few “dif-
ficult situations." though none have eome to
blows “There’s a set or regular guys that wateh
out for me," she said. And Frazier's seen the seeds
or town-gown stereotypes spread when eollege stue

“But you ean't rollow the town-gown dichotomy."
she said.

“There was a lot or talk my ﬁrst year about

estimated Petersen. As an employee, ltowv
