“In the early
morning hours of
Tuesday, Sept. 28,
the grave silence
was shattered by
splattering sounds ,
as the administra-
tion building was
given an unau-
thorized paint job
one with which
the administration

was not pleased.

NO MORE SAND: We are so happy to see that the sand has been
removed from 8th Ave. The brick really adds a touch of class to the

Grinnell campus.

NO DINNER ON FRIDAY: Due to the Noyce rededication, students will
not be able to go to the dining hall for dinner. Now we have to go off

Stop coffee date extinction

It’s an ofﬁcial Grinnellian crisis! The coffee
date is going extinct, the casual date that’s just
for fun! The date that doesn’t mean that you
have to hook up or surf a relationship (gaspl).
WTF guys, why are we letting this die out?

There’s nothing to lose; if you get it ‘no’, it was ’

just for coffee. If you get a yes, you get a fun
coffee break. No worries. So witch out Grinnell,
I might just ask you our. If you soy ‘yes’, cool.
But you’re welcome to say 510', too. As I said, it’s
just cafes.

I wish I would have known...

Why didn't’anyonc tell me 1 could have voted
on October 1st? Had I known, I would have to-
tally Bamcked the vote within our comfortable
campus conﬁnes. But no political groups on cam—
pus proved successful in genernnng awareness
of such a revolutionary convenience Although
democrats genemlly favor conservation of the
environment,l think it would have been prudent
for a group like Campus‘Dems to temporarily
forgo this convlcu'on in order promote early votv
ing, Afﬁxing 17 paper fliers around the door of
every academic and residenurl buildin would
have been an effective my to get spread e word.
I’m scared. What‘s going to happen to our coun-
try after I failed to vote on October 1? Now I'm
left with the sud options of voting in November,
or casting my vote in the more contentious race
in Michigan. lionly someone would hove killed

more trees...
