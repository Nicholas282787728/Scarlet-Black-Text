she Ankylosaurus (angaKYL- sawnus), which she praised as “rlxc

Taking a professor to lunch in Cowles doesn’t quite

we want to know more about them than the subjects
they teach, We wish we could hang outin their office

why a student and professor relationship should be
kept distant, or do we? Anyway, what do we do when

I’ve been meaning to write this rent for a couple
weeks now. but as the snow melts and the sidewalks
once again become visible without the use of heavy
machinery (by this I mean a shovel; I’m not mechani-
cally inclined), it seems just as applicable. Why is
there so much broken glass all over campus? People,
what reason is there to smash a beer bottle, ora glass,
or a computer monitor on the sidewalks, in the log-
gia, or in the grass? I understand you were probably
angry, orjust dropped it, but chances are that those
shards aren't going to get cleared'away any time soon

, and when spring ﬁnally rolls its lazy head onto cam-

? pus and people once again start walking around bare-
foot orin sandals, that gLass is going to prove a bloody
mess. It’s all too easy to be more responsible than
that; please do.

argh! it seems thati can no longer escape gender-
biased language at this college. i thought grinnell
was a safe haven. but with ﬁrst-years calling them-
selves "freshmen," and even Sarah aswell using "up-
perclassman" in her latest column instead of the
phrases "older student" or ”upperclass student," the
" man” curse seems unavoidable. idon'tthink
that what i'm asking (gendenneutralword choices) is
too paci or too anal or picky or whatever. it’s pretty
much a basic equality that we deserve, and it is to be
simply expected at a college that proclaims itself "libs
erall,’l and has, after all, a minority of men on cam

pus, '
