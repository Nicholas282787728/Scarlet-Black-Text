Transportation policy under review

Resolution may allow SGA to fund fuel costs for student organizations

BY BRIAN SHERWIN

When campus groups travel, they are often faced with two
choices for [ranspottntionﬂiiher seek out elusive College pro
vided drivers and vehicles, or cough tip the gas money them
selves. With new legislation in SGA. some students hope that
they will soon he reimbursed for their traveling
funds.

John Burrows ’10, SGA vice president
for student affairs, presented tr resolution to
Joint Board On \Vcclnesddy that would allow
SGA to allocate money to cover fuel costs for
students driving personal vehicles to schools
sanctioned events.

According to Assistant Treasurer Jim
Mulholland, who sits on the Transportation
Policy Committee, drivers will be required
to take a short certiﬁcation course through
security, provide proof at insurance up to
$300,000 and a recent oil change to SGA, and
guarantee that they spend less than five hours
behind the wheel each day of travel.

According to Mulholland, while the Col»
lege had setup the Transportation Policy
Committee r recent years, fuel funding was
withheld in response to an accident during a
ReNew trip last spring. “Last year, there was
an accident and during some of the discus
sions we tried to get information since we
had funded part of the trip,” Mulholt
land said. “And no one muted to give
us information about the incident
we decided we couldn't go funding
things without putting some rules in place.”

Burrows said this was a liability issue. “Before the problem
was that students were taking their personal vehicles on all sorts
of trips that were afﬁliated with the College because they were
representing Gtinnell utrows said. “The school is held liable
it" there ' "

According to SGA Treasurer Emily Wax ’09, the new policy
should help reduce the liahrlity ofthe college and make funding
more efrrcrent. "[The new pohey] will make funding a much
easier process for studentgroups that use SGA funds to travel,"
Wax said.

However, there is still some concern about
whether student drivers should be allowed to use
personal vehicles at all.“There are folks at the Col—

lege who believe the safest possible way means
transportation on the College‘s ﬂeet vehi-
cles,” said Dean otReligious Lire Deanna
Sholb, a member or the Transportation
Policy Committee.
In the past similar rules had been
in place, hut not enforced according to
Mulholland. “At one point in time Stu-
dent Attatrs was supposed to he col-
lccnng insura e certification when they
were funding trips," Mulliolland said. “As
far as I know this didn't happen."
Transportation Policy Committee
member Stephen Briseoe, director of
Security, said that past driver training
programs had heen beneficial. “Insure
ance companies came to campus to
give training progmms,"Briscoe said.
“Some students have even said in the
past that this program has helped
them in regards to their insurance
rates."
Whether or not the resolution
passes, College transportation poli-
cy will still be an issue of concern. “The discussion is still going
to continue about whether this is the safest and most effective
way to provide money and funding for transportation for stu-
dents,"Burrows said.
Joint Board will vote on the resolution at its next meeting
