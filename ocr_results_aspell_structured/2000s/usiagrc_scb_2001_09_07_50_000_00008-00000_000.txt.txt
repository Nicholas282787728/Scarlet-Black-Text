new people on the team," Alison NalT'OZ said. ”I

potential for success in the future," head coach

distance."

most of the starters seeing their first real playing
time. This year the team returns with much more
expenence, especially in setter Stephanie Schmidt

Dinah Zehot '03. Despite several rule changes,
including one that scores games using rally storing,
the team is to this season. "This season has
already started off on a tremendous foot, and we
hope to continue our success throughout the
season," Schmidt said.

Summer demo derby teaches sports lessons

Grinnell may have taken a hreak for the summer, hut the
sports world was not so lucky, As you were lounging around sip.
ping your icy muted drinks on tho hcauriful tropical hcaeli out-
side your house this summer, sports ofnll londs
were trudging ahead, and I was plotting a way
to get my revenge on you for having a troplcll
heath outside your house.

Thirrummerwas hill orsportinghighlights.

But enough ahout that newsworthy nonsense, let's talk ahout
me. I used my break as an intense training camp 501 could come
hack this year and he the host sports editor 1 could he. By ”intense
training camp," I mtnn 1 woke up at 8 every morning, thought
ahout how to be an editing :lHrsmr, then decided the host way to
do that was to go hack to sleep until lunchtime. it was truly grur
cling

two balls, no strikes

Since rhercwas a television right by my hed, i also spent ample
time watching spotting ovens, and I’m talking ahout all kinds of
spottmg events hem. When you don't have cahlo and your view.
ing choices are a documentary on rhc life cycle ofrhe housefly set
backrtorback reruns afml’lilrd Rock from the sun" and n firaey
screen that might he porn. the senior I’GA tour starts looking
really exciting.

That's not to say that all my tnnning was done lnrlmusc, or

inhed as the case may have heen. Figuring I needed to expose
myselrto a variety of sports to truly
get a handle on my ioh, i went
with my summer housemates to

Riverside, low, for a demolition

derhy. The fact that Riverside is
the settprotlaimed "ruture hirrhplsee ofCapt, Kirk" and that the
demolition derhy wru part of“Trekfusf" had nothing to do with
the trip. Neither did my huge collection oTSrarTrele models hide
den away in my basement at home,

i was going to use my impeccahle credentials to land my
housemates and 1 good soars, out then wejusr walked into the pit
arcs and sat down without tioiihlo. Let me roll you, there is noclo
ing more exciting to n 5portx-cditor-m-tmlnlllg rhnii exploding
radiators, crunching steel and drunk iniddleagod wives with a
titer in one hand and a smoke in the other cheering on their

hushands in the derhy.

The demo derhy really inspired me, hut it was not really so
much how-Io»havera»betterrsporursectlon inspiration as it was
wnnow-Chasli-cal'yintoﬁdch other inspiration. without a car to
crash, though, i had to settle for taking away lessons ahout how
to improve the spotu section.

Here's what i learned, The demolition derhy had a wide vane
cty ofinrcicsring people at it (no one dressed as a Klingon, though).
Likewise, the sports section this year will have a wide variety of
interesting articles, focusing on the many aspects ofcrinnell mhr
lellcs. i'm hoping there will he Ktiiigons, too.

The demolition derhy had a Trolcfosr wehsire. The 5ch is
onlinet too. While we don‘t have a wchpagc that will lmk you to

ohviously, will not.
