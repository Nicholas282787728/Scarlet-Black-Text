Stones roll their way to success,
Grinnell four just want to have fun

By Kurt Orzeck
Special to the 5&5

In terms of audio activity, the Grinnell
Bowladtome resembles any other sports area.
The cheers, profanity, hand slaps, and cracki ngs
ofball against wood might cause someone to
think that they were witnessing a baseball game.
But baseball is not the issue here. open your
eyes and you’ll see that, visually, this scene is
quite different. Bloated bellies, grizzled beers,
and a thick haze oteigarette smoke are con»
vincing evidence ofthe fact that these athletes
are not about to be signed onto millionrdollxt
Contracts. But perhaps an even more unlikely
sight in this sports place is the five young men
who boast at least 25 fewer years in age than
their average competitor.

“They ﬁt right in with everybody here," says
Bill i—lammen, a Knights of Columbus team
player and friendly rival of the Grinnell Cole
lege Bowling stones, “They’ve been a lot of
fun and represent the college well," he adds.

This past September, a student quintet cn-
listed in the Bowladrome’s yearlong Monday
night league. Since then, Mark Paulson ‘00
and Nate White ‘00 led their team into a first»
place position at the end of
January. Currently lingering
in second placewith only one
less win than the ﬁrsteplace
Keith's Pro Shop, the Stones
bowled a strong game this
past Monday against the
KnighrsofColumbusandare
waiting to hear the updated
league standings. Their 3.1
victory over the K or C left
the latter team dead in the
water and may have ousted
Keith's Pm shop from their
throne.

Will this aggression
against LlICStonesStand? Ape
patently not, according to bowling wizard
Brooke Heaton, “I think die Bowling Stone
chemistry is what zccuunts for our success.” he

League Play

The Bowladrome league season
spans 32 weeks, from September until

May. 10 teams participate in the Mons

day night Men's league, ranging from
Hy-Vee to the Grinnell Poliee. Each
team bowls three games per week against
an opposing team Roughly halfway
through the season, players dully note
that the highlight thus far has been Tom
Moyets perfect game score oisoo points,
which occurred over the winter break,
League standings are not determined
by overall pin eount or average, but by
the margin with which each team beats their
handicap. The handicap number is the result
ofsubtracring a player’s average from 200. If
standings were determined by average instead
orhandieap, the stones would be in last place.
Their ream average is
696, as compared to
Keith’s Pro Shops 833 av-
erage. Hardeelsboasts the
highest average but is
stuck in the sixth-place
slot.
Thestoneshaveass-
41 record, just shy ofthe
5640 reeord of Keith’s
Pro shop. in third place
is Hy-ve: with a 535-
425 record. Though

strings, a fourth score is

the ﬁrst three and is
counted as another game.

A banquet will be held at the end or the
season, at which time prizes will be awarded
from the $7-2-weck fee each bowler pays.

Attitude

white identified the uncharacteristic 2g»
gressiveness that overcomes Heaton upon en.
toting the Bowladtomc. “Brooke is generally
about loveand peace, but on the lanes he turns
into a destructive maehine of pins and foes
alike," he said.

Ben Weiss ‘02, the only non—senior in the
pack, is also a vocal member of the stoncs
squad, “1 dabbled in paeihsrn once. Not at
the Bowladrome, ofcoursc.” he said. Weiss's
feisty behavior has earned him a reputation on
the lanes. Known for shouting and even, on
occasion, “ﬂashing his piece out in the lane,"
weiss denied his inflammatory behavior and
maintained, “l’rn perfectly ealm." When I
questioned him further about what he meant,
he merely replied, “Calmcr than you are."

Fellow teammates approach the lane with
more measured patience. “Bowling is an in-
tensely psychological game," said Whllc, who
leads the team in most felled pins with 9,737.
White is also known for his sclfrlnﬂictcd menr

ml anguish, which he tries to channel through
his intrieate strategy. “Mastery ofselfleads to
more consistent strikes and a penchant for pick
ing up the most unlikely spares.” Mike said.

Paulson is tied with \Vhite with 2154 aver
age and a consequent 45 handicap. As to how
he approaches the game, Paulson said, “were
used to adversity iii the lanes. Every night a
new challenge. And we’re proud to represent
Grinnell college as bastions Before
paulson could finish his statement, he was
called for his turn.

Aden Beihl ‘00 is much more contained
about his game, Leading the team in most
games played (so), Beihl docs not take his ime
pressive 7i handicap to heart. As a four-year
Bowling class participant at the college, he
noted that Heaton, Weiss, and his own stores
are “pathetie.” Beihl's pitch is by fat the fast—
est, whieh may be attributed to the cxtta frames
he and Paulson play after ﬁnishing the weekly
league dose of3 strings.

Technique

On the whole, the stories are faraway
bowlers, priming themselvcsat the brinkofthc
wood. Beihl literally see-saws on this edge.
Paulson does, as well, but stands offto the left,
where he can prepare his unique z.finger hook
shot. As ifhewere slipping, Paulson’s right leg
swipes the ground. and the are of his pitch
causes the ball to dart ham the brink of the
gutter to the center ofthe lane.

White is a no.1ooktr at times. With dark
memories ofhis lowesr.scoting game still plagu.
inghis mind. he avoids eyeing his missed shots.
With a shake ofhis head, White retires to his
seat, trying not to let his misses fare him.
Howeverwnitesustains team spirit and cheers
his teammates from the bench.

Heaton summed up the team’s techniques
as follows: “i believe in something i call ‘ten
pin poetry: I think Adcn goeswith a theory of
‘musclt: memory: but I’m notsure For myself
personally, and I think the team in general
shares the same sentiments, the sport ofbowh
inghasaspiritualtwisr. llove to bowl. Ilovc
knockin‘ that 5"“ down. it begins with the
graeehil stride leading up to the release, one
must hit the pins, not with the ball, but with

the entire body, moving in a poetic thrust that
is ﬁerce, yet sensual. When the ball is released,
all control is abandoned. You have to see the
pocket and never lose your eye from it, You
must become loeked in a traneelike state of
ioeus, and then kill the focus and simply dance
the dance.”

Diversion

But amidst thtsctioiis tenor that rhestones
seem to convey, there is, to some extent, acare<
lree attitude at the core, Heaton tematked ﬂat,
“I like to sip a Millennium Bud or two before I
really get into a groove. All subsequent Mil-
lennium budweisets merely fuel the force widi
greater retoeity."

White and Beihl similarly toss a few back
during the eoutse ofthe game. weiss, who is
underage, does not drink during league play,
but said that ifhe had the ehoiee, he'd be down-
ing White Russians.

Paulson is notorious for abstaining com.
pletely from inloxicants before or during play,
and is touted by teammates as “the most con-
sistently sober player."

In one of the more memorable moments
ofrbe season, Heston betTom Moycr’s brother
Rick, who has a 180 average, that he could win
with his 115 average. Heaton nearly won the
bet. The team’s most notable victory came when
they defeated a team led by an unidentiﬁed
”pcdcrast."

Three team members have received person.
alized bowling balls since the start of the sea
son—Beilil and i>aulson in September, and
White over the winter break. The ubiquitous
energy and sense afcamaraderic amongst the
stones suggests that they are headed towards
emotional victory, regardless ofwhat place they
ﬁnish the season in, scores are not the only
issue here—what really seems to matter to the
stones is an upbeatattitudc,diligent cfiort, and.
ofcoiirsc, good sportsmanship.

“were happy to cheer on our opponents,
butwe still have competitive spirit," says Beihl.

jessica watson ‘00 has not missed a single
stones game, cheering the team on through
out the season. stunned by the teams remark
able standing in tltcleagtic, she said. “its amak
ing what those boys can do with their balls."
