Haircutter overlooked

Dear Editors,

considering that Dave Paulson did the hair design for a
student-run fashion show in Herrick Chapel two years ago,
it is a shame that your reporters did not visit his salon when
writing your article on local haireutters. One would hope
that those who give their time to contribute to student life
and student activities would be paid an equal courtesy by the
student newspaper. in any casc,I highly recommend Dave
Paulson Hair Design to the entire campus community.

Coca-Cola Company
responds to letter

Dear Mr. Rathod:

Recently, 1/2: Slﬂl [c1 69’ Bird: printed some unsettling ac—
cusations regarding Coca-Cola and our operations in various
regions around the world, including Colombia and India. I
am writing to you to set the record straight.

Colombia:

- Our Company and bottlers have conducted business in
Colombia for 70 ycars In Colombia and around the world,
CocasCola respects the rights of employees to choose third
party representation or
union membership. our
bottling partners enjoy
extensive. normal relas
tions with 12 separate
unions in Colombia and
currently have collective
bargaining agreements
in place covering wages,
benefits and working
conditions for all mem-
bers of these unionsl In
a country where violence
against union members has deterred all but approximately
four percent of the labor force from unionizing, 3 1 percent
or coca-cola FEMSA‘s Colombia employees belong to
unions,

' Two different inquiries in Colombiaionc iii a Coloms
bian court and one by the Colombian Attorney Generaliret
viewed allegations of human and labor rights violations in-
volving Coca-Cain's bottling plants in Colombia, and found
no evidence ofwrongdoing by our Company or our bottling
partners.

- A separate independent investigation of claims legutd-
iiig human rights abuses at CocasCola facilities in Colombia
also have found no evidence to support them.

- The CocasCola Company and its bottling partners are
committed to proViding Colombian workers, palticulnrly
union leaders, as much protection as possible. If any employ-
cc feels unsafe, local bottlcrs, working with local unions and
the Colombian government, provide transportation to and
from work, loans for secure housing, loans to improve seeiis
rity of union offices, paid cellular phones for emergency use,
and shirt and job changes.

Big companies like
ours are accursed

of a whole host of
things because of the
publicity it generates
for the attackers,
regardless of the truth
of the allegations.

~ For the facts regarding our operations in Coloinbiii,1
urge you to visit www.cn fwmrg

India:

- A number or independent scientiﬁc and governmental
reports indicate that the cocascola plant in Kerala should
not be held responsible for the water shortages in the area.

- We require that all of our plants, including those in In-
dia, monitor and comply with good environmental practices
and applicable law. .

' For the facts regarding our operations in India, please
visit wwwram-mlaiildia mm

Big companies like ours are accused of a whole host or
things because ofthe publicity it generates for the attackers,
regardless orthc truth ofthe allegationsi‘his is a frustrating
experience for us and for all people who want to base their
decisions on facts.

At CocasCola, we have a shared set of values for the way
we operate, everywhere in the world. These shared values
include respect for individuals and for the communities in
which we litre.

Victoria’s dirty paper-
wasting secret

Dear Editor,

How manycatalogs do you get that you didn't sign up for.
don't want, or that you just recycle? The average American
gets 59 catalogs per year. Victoria’s Secret is one of the ins
dustry lcadeis in amount ofcatalogs printed and also uses no
recycled content in their CntalOgSiThe Canadian Boreal for-
est is being logged so that Victoria's Secret can send out over
one million catalogs daily, many of which are unwanted. Re
cently about 400 Grinnellians expressed interest in reducing
their paper consumption through signing up for the paper
campaign. The waste created by Victoria's secret is horren-
dously worse than the waste created by Grinncll college.

We challenge you to tak e action against Victoria's Secret
and help save our forests. Heie are a few things you can do.
They’re easy.

1. Call and request that you be taken offthcir mailing
list.

2. lfyau are a Victoria’s secret shopper, reconsider; or if
you feel you must wear rhcir underwear, voice your concerns
about their environmental practices at trim:rididirrymm,
7M2.

3.Take direct action with Free The Planet! on December
2. E-mail [ftp] for info, or stop by our meetings Tuesdays at
