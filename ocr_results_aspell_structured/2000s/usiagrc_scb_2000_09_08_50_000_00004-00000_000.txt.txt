Maya wrore roughly one book every year unril shows 18.
When she was 17, she also starred writing a column called
“Musings” for (he Indian Express, one of three national

Narurally, rhe question arose as ro whar drew Maya

Considering Maya's early wriringsueoess made me cu-

 

rious abour how ir felr ro be so young and aeeomplished.
“in hard in be bad,” she admitted. “What if rhe resr of
my life is an anrielimax?” Bur despire rhese insecurities,
Maya looks forward ro more wriring and different kinds
ofwriring. When 1 broughr up rhe possibiliry ofwriring

ever doing rhis. Whatever she wrires, herion or opinion.
Maya lends ro ir a misehievous sense ofhumor. in one of
her favorire eolumns, Maya wrires, “Most people insisr

Maya says rhar whenever she meers someone who
