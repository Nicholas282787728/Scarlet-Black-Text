And now in closing...

This is my lnr column for the Sam/or éBlark, and I
wanred ro take a eouple of paragraphs as say goodbye. I
would like ro thank everyone who has read my wnrlng
over the lasr ihree years, esperially rhese who have given
m: meaningful Fccdback. I have received hundreds ofemalls
and lerrers from students, faculty, srarr. alumni, eommue
niry members, and orhers responding ro whar I wrote. I
hope rhar some orwhari said has helped sparle debate and
has made people reeonslder some orihelr beliefs and ldeas.
I know rhar in ivrlrlng this column. I have certainly had ro
reeonsider many or my own.

Thanks espeelally ro Courtney Sherwood ’00 and Katie
Mears ’03 for being dedicated cdlrors-in-clllcf and allow»

Thats an avarage of one per year (yeah, we’re good at math).
Katie estimates that we’ve gotten 30 negative comments (of
all sorts, printed and nonrprinted, emailed and left on an-

about 20-25 hours a week, while making about $4 an hour.
Granted, we choose to do this, and for the most part we have
