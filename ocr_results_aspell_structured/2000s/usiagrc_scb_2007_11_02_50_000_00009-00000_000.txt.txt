Pursuing pleasure,

I was excited to see Ella when I got back from Grinnell this
summer. She has a laugh like a seal and a fabulously entertain-
rng sex hrol am always rmpressed by her vivid descriptions of
multiple orgasms, sex in bathrooms and the like. For me she
has been a model for the attainment of sexual fulﬁllment. So I
was surprised when 1 called her and she answered crying hysr
terically.Tlrc test had come back posir
rive. She struggled to string sentences
together, bur managed to tell rue the
whole story.

Ella had gone home wasted with
her female roommates one night and
instead of crashing into three separate
beds, the girls had a triumphant three-
some to ﬁnish offthe night. Soon after—
wards, her roommates were diagnosed with Human Papilloma
Virus (HPV), Ella got scared she might have it, but luckily the
test was negative,

Weeks later, she got involved with Reid, who toyed with
Ella during a rocky and noncommittal relationship He could
live only for his art and had nothing to spare. Not even money
for condoms. Eventually Ella gave up on him. At the end or
the school year, Ella came back home for a few weeks to relax.
That's when she found out she had HPV,

Ella feared that she would never sleep
with anyone ever again. Her rears melted,
though, when she met Noah. (Despite his
"Mickey Mouse cheeks," he was good in
bed). Ella and Noah slept together, but
they hndnt used protection and Ella felt
awﬁil about it. Noah didnt know that she
had HPV.

I told Ella that she needed to let Noah
know of her diagnosis. It would mean rer
vealirig the truth to herself as much as to
Noah. Sometimes one cannor comprehend the situation until
the expression on someones face urwerls it, And regardless of
Ella‘s personal trau ma,I felt that she owed it to Noah to let him
know of the possrble ramification oftheir copulation, It worrld
then be Noah's responsibility to ini‘orm his potential mates of
his disease status.

I believe people must own up to their actioiis,even ifit may
be “embarrassing,” as Ella says. She strained under rhe weight

For me, she has been a model
for the attainment of sexual
fulﬁllment. 50 l was lunar/red
when I called her and she
answered trying Water/(ally

but at what cost?

or her guilt at having concealed the truth trom Noah. It is her
gililt that begs her to declare herself. If Ella tells Noah what is
going on, I think it will be better for both of them. But Ella
takes a different view. In this world, it is every woman for her-
self. She tells me that HPV is so common that Noah might
contract it from anyone, especiallyifhe is in the habit ofsleep-

ing around with people wrthorrt using
protection.

I have often thought oi‘protectiun
as a symbolic impediment to openness
in a relationship, How can you be honr
est and caring iryou are protected from
your partner? I don’t know if as pos
sible to love someone ifyou're shields
ed; oi, iryou can truly express yourself
through latex. But it seems like honesty and openness require
protection more than anything. In bed full of invisible dangers,
desire and passion aie not enough to sustain a relationship.

There is no moral to this story, but Ella’s romantic encounr
teas do tell us ofthc dangers of loving someone else over one
self, While I criticize Ella's decision to hide her disease from
her partners,i mostly wish that she would protect herselffrom
those who would wear away her good health, physically and
emotionally.

By leaving it up to Reid to love her, Ella
lost her self-love, She made him responsible
for her own fulﬁllment, so she did not di»
rect the nature of that fulﬁllment. While it's
important to open ourselves to others and
allow them pleasure us, Ella lost her love in
the fight for delight.

seltrlove plays into pleasure in numer-
ous ways. some people look for love in oth-
ers because they cannot ﬁnd it themselves.
Some people fill therr vords with sexual
pleasure Others use sexual acts to express love for selfand for
others. (Ma urbation, by the way. is the ultimate e ressron of
sclfrapprcciation, As Woody Allen says, “Don’t ock “\ﬂstul"
bation; it’s sex with someone I love ") But ifwc stray too far
from sclfrlovc, which includes selfrlirotection, we run the risk
of only having the love of someone else.Thc love of orhcrs of»
ten comes with strings attached, as did Reid’s. And then, Ella's
pleasure became pain.

Bob is revealed

Regarding Olyd Pavlova '10s letter to the editor published
Oct. 12: he asks to be enlightened if anyone knows who Bob
w

Please allow me to provide the enlightenment. In a very
Grinnellian at ofwhimsy, Bobs Corrcehouse was named atrcr
a three legged car who fiequeilted campus in the early 905. He
had disappeared by the time I arrived on campus but the hope
was that his legend would continue to be told.

Now could someone tell me who this "AR.I—l"guy is?

—Rrirre Parlour '96

 

The old saying is true: Cs do get degrees

“What are you plannrng to do for the
rest of your life?" is offlcmlly my least favorite
question,Thc unwanted rnterrogntron makes
me feel helpless; afterward I lie in bed wons
dering if] am going to spend the rest of my
life working for a temp agency or worseijoins
ing the majority of girls in my high school
class who were recently “debuted" and will
be married and “pop out" children soon after
graduation. (There is a reason I left North
Carolina's nice weather for frigid Iowa.)

1 hope my fears
aie unwarianted. I
don’t like children,
weddings relrify
me, and I have this
strange desire for
a careei: But, my
constantly sliding
GPA makes imr
mediate admittance to graduate school and
the accompanying delay ornonrschool life an
increasingly unlikely outcome,

I was once convinced that every bad mark
doolned me to failure in the ﬁlture while good
scores were one step closer to my success. But
then it dawned on me: my academic record is
not going to matter five years from gradua-
tionvmaybe not even the moment after I get
my diploma.

It is easy to lose sight ofjust how much
ofGrinnell's beneﬁts cannot be quantiﬁed by
mere marks on paper, Learning a language for
foreign policy work or knowing biology {or
medical school is undeniably useful. but there
are many other poterrtrally more valuable skills
to gcr from Grinnell.

“Critical thinking and reading" is a vague,
over-used term, but it is hard to find a life path
where it is not a necessary skill. According re a

Anna Gilbert’09
Tlle Flip Side

poll taken by the National Association ofCol-
leges and Employers, employers value lead~
ership and communication skills name than
GPA. yet we don’t talk about our use and ties
velopnrent ofthose skrlls alter leading a solid
class discussion.

Kathleen Powell, the new director of the
career Development Ofﬁce. pointed out that
“it is notjust GPA biit whatever else is in your
package," which also includes (but is not lime
itcd to) your work. internship, volunteer and

research experience
as well as leader-
ship, problem solv-
ing and organiza-
tional abilities.
Joyce stern of
, Academic Advisr
‘ ing explained to me
that “expeiienccs
you pick up along the way define you are and
how you can affect change in the world " As
an alumna, Stern mentioned her Introduction
to Acting class that greatly boosted her corrar
dence when speaking even though she rook it
on a whim and the course work did not relate
to her psychology major,

And a Grinnell degree regardless of irra-
jet or GPA is widely respected among those
who know academia well. In addition, access
to Grinnell’s alumni network, far superior to
that of most comparable colleges, provides a
lifelong boost to job searches and social nctr
working

While intense focus on the subject mac
tor of a course can he one of the bcst thlnas
about Grinnell, too much emphasis on assign-
ments and grades can be destructive, it causes
rensron between students and professors, ob~
scuring the strong relationship rhar can exist

there and devaluiug one or my top reasons for
coming to Grinnell (besides escaping marriage
and babies). And such a narrow focus at an
already academically rrgorous school can take
over your life, leaving no room for other imr
porrant parts ofour time here, I almost failed
Combinatorics, but I sat in the front row, \is7
ited the professor frequently and now a year
after the class I still consider him to be a close
friend, in spite orthe copious red scribbles on
my exams.

Being constantly surrounded by exception-
al, intelligent peers makes it easy ro lose sight
of our own talents. Grinnell is a school where
being at the very bottom otthe class is srill a
step ahead of nlaily other college students. It
makes me sad to see very respectable seniors
giaduating each yeai without a clue to then
enormous abilities and insecure about their
looming future.

Some people need to get in to graduate
school to fulfill their plans, but I still find it
depressing to treat college like high school,
constantly rrcrring over school work that is
only a stepping stone ro the next level.

Powell agrees. She told me that "life is too
short to focus solely on grades. Employers and
graduate schools alike pay attention to your
GPA, but also look at the total person and the
qualities, skills and abilities they bring to the
table."

sure, a few speciﬁc memorized facts from
class will nia e me a bettcrscducatcd citizen or
an rnreresting dinner party guest; but so would
other knowledge and experiences. 1 got a C
on my ﬁrst tutorial paper and bawlcd over it.
I personally wish I had known earlier that it
didn’t really matter then, and definitely doesn’t
mean I am doomed to l‘iollst:\\'lfe*d0m for the
