November 5 2004

We've been back at Grinnell for
two weeks now and fall break seems
like a distant dream. The memories
of those nine glorious days seem
to be drifting away: all the sleep
we got, the TV we watched, the
homework we never did, the ‘
family we saw, and of course,
the food we enjoyed.

I, for one, ate very well over
break. Not only was I able
to partake in the delir
eious meals my mother t
made and the Chica- l
go-style pizza I had
been craving, but I
also took a trip to
New York that ended in culinary de-
light.

My mom had made reservations
for her birthday at a restaurant known
for its gourmet Scandinavian cuisine,
and I was quite excited to try it.

Where else would I have the op-
portunity to enjoy delicious food and
celebrate my great Nordic heritage all
in the same sitting?

Naturally, I was already excited
when we sat down and opened the
menu. I scanned through the op-

the scarlet and black

Craving a fall break cuisine

tionsimiiny kinds of fish, tasty salads,
and a variety of scrumptious appetiz-
ers, all sounding deliciousil looked up
from my menu to express my enthusit
asm and 1 saw a ﬂicker in my mom’s

~ eye. She was looking at the bottom

*ﬁ\'

right corner of the menu with a

mischievous smile on her face. I 10*

catcd the spot of her attention on

my own menu and found the item

she was eyeing so joyfully.

It was called the “Bite

Menu,” a 16 (16!) course

meal consisting of

many very small por-

tions of food. Since

my mom was feeling

extravagant (after all, it was her birth

dayr) we decided to go for it. The two

hours that followed are a blur, but I re

member many, many plates and some

of the most delicious food I've ever
eaten.

Every time I thought there couldn’t
possibly be any more courses, a waiter
would come out and set another tiny
serving before me and mumble some
explanation of the culinary delight I
was about to enjoy,

I won't even attempt to remember

everything 1 had, but the highlights
included smoked tandoori salmon,
horseradish apple soup, peanut butter
mousse, and (the most intriguing of
all our snacks) pickled duck tongue. It
was delicious. It was amazing. It was
horrible having to come back and cat
at Quad. Back in Grinnell, I kept re-
membering all the delicious food I ate
during that meal. so I decided to try
to create my own sixteentcourse meal
at Chlad dining hall.

I'll admit, it wasn’t quite as elegant
or appetizing as my dinner in New
York, but it was much cheaper and I
think it held its own. so here you go,
for those of you who just feel like the
dining halls lack glamour, here is proof
that you can create your own multir
course meal:

Dale's “Bite Menu"

1; Two Slices oprple with Cheese
Cubes

Z: Tureen of Chicken Noodle
Soup.

3: Wonderbread toast (1 was go-
ing to make bruschetta, but because
of Florida’s lack of tomatoes, I had to
settle.)

4: Three cheerios circling a dab of

peanut butter.

5: Biastcut yellow squash with
squirt of lemon.

6: Steamed basmati rice served'in a
mug (I don't know, it seemed fancier.)

7: Vegetable Mix #16 served on a
bed of iceberg lettuce.

8: Mesculin greens salad with bal-
samic vinegar dressing.

9: Orange Jeler with strange ore
ange cream on top.

10; one piece of pork vindaloo
served on a slice ofcucumbcrr

11: Celery stick with peanut butter
and two raisins.

12: One pickle strip with three
dots of mustard.

13: carried corn and rice soup
with a square ofbagel to compliment.

14: Shredded carrots and raisins.

15: Slice of cheesecake with bar
nana slices.

16: Dab of ice cream with choctr
late drizzle.

Yes, it was hard work, and by the
end I was disgustingly full, but with a
little work, a big imagination, and a lot
of dedication, anyone can create her
very own 16 course meal right here in
the dining halls. Bon appetitel

Montana’s curious gender politics

During the first week of July, my friend Maggie
invited me over for dinner, and as we dined in her
SelfTSufﬁC‘Ient garden, we happened upon the topic
of gender-identity on the frontier—a decidedly
intricate topic. Back in Chicago, 1 chalk up any
woman capable of igniting a fire or who possesses
the ability to chop wood to the less heterosexually
inclined ofour sex.

Here, where the average woman can dissemble a
rifle and survive alone in the woods for days, picks
ing apart the stereotypical category of “feminine”
requires a re-evaluation, or at least walking softly
and wearing little to no makeup.

Maggie later asked “But Vanessa, why are leer
bians so unattractive?” which I responded to with
shock and piles of evidence to contrary. Finding
lesbian inﬂuence in everything from fashionrforr
ward eyewear to boyrcut jeans to the intrepid beaur
ties on TIJeL Ward, 1 quantified lesbians firmly un-
der the heading ofhip.

From Pigalle to Andersonville,I had yet to meet
an unattractive lesbian, and informed Maggie that
her misconception had much to do with her not
leaving the state in the last three years and the abs
sence ofa television in her home. Maggie titled her
face into a [our/IE position, "Yes, Vanessa, but have
you met a Martian/l lesbian?”

Maggie had recently inﬁltrated the inner sanct
turn of a weekly lesbian potluck, and relayed im
ages of tietdye shirts paired with the socks and
sandals combo, the omnipresence of the mullet as

the haircut du jour, and unibrows as rampant as a
contagion.

She suggested that I meet her newly-made
friend Amber, who might expose me to the trends
and activities ofMontana lesbians.

Amber arrived at our gathering fresh from soft»
ball practice, and narrated an annual New Year's
trip she and her friends made to Holland Lake, a
string of cabins and resorts north ofMissoula.

They played touch football on the lake’s
ice, drank Pabst Blue Ribbon beer in copi»
ous amounts, and played Truthtoerarc as a
means to discover who was the most butch
(butchest?) ofthe crew.

But from the moment Amber arrived,
the chip on her shoulder in regards to me
weighed close to a metric ton.

In describing my furniture
as “fancy,“ and in her visible
dismay at the lack of variety of alcohol i
fridge,I felt her judgments like a checklist.

At some point in the evening, we began to com-
pare cultural notes in approaches to bathing. John's
mother had just emailed from Japan, expressing her
delight in their tradition ofsitting in the shower, as
it eased the leg-shaving process.

After that anecdote received an irritated look
from Amber, she offered “You know those showers
at the gym?"

“No, l've actually never been to a gym."

“Obviously." She gave me elevator eyes and

snorted, and proceeded to exile me from the con-
versation.

Amber excused herself shortly thereafter, and I
turned to Maggie with pleading eyes. “Maggie,"I
whined, “why was Amber mean to me?"

Now, I had met some resistance in Montana,
and I couldn’t seem to put my finger on the exact

variable or source. Perhaps I look urban, out
of place, and upon first impression people
instantly identify me as an outsider.
Perhaps it's because I sound pomp-
ous and pretentious. More than
once, after stating an opinion in
a discussion, a Montanan would
. reply, “Well, you think that bet
‘ cause you’re an intellectual," int
, stantly dismissing me and my
words.
I‘d think to myself, yes, one
day I might get paid to think
for a living, so shouldn’t my thoughts be given ram
attention?

As a sister in the movement and a vocal pro-
ponent of womens’ rights,l never thought I’d ens
counter such a situation. Did I incur Amber’s polite
wrath due to one of my ostensibly un—Montanan
qualities? What egregious conversational error had
I committed? Did 1 trigger a preconceived resents
ment? I can only assume one ofthe three occurred,
as I was never asked to pass as Maggie's date again.
