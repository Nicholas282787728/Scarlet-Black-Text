Defending the sanctity of marriage

jusnn rathod
eclectic innovator

lr was anodier eeld sunday in criniiell when 1 hopped out or
bed and nippedon theTv. i had been eampaigiiing the whole night
before for the Super Tuesday eleerions and just wanred to lay back
and wareh some sporrseenter. Bur. alas, berore reould turn the Clique
nel there hewas. ltwas a meal vaguely recognized; he had a right eye
that eouldn'r srep blinking and a mourh diat eouldn't stop spewing
erazy talk abour eorporations. Then it hit me hard. Suddenly, 1 en»
rered inro a series or violenr rlashbaeks or hanging ehads and the
horrendous sighr of Katherine l-iarris' makeup. RALPH NADEml!
WHY?!? Don't you realize ihar a 2004 presidenrial run will only sap
die liberal vote away from Rathod? Have you even heard my stump
speeeh trashing Republimns and uplirring liberals everywhere? Who's
helping you discern right from wrong, Mel Gibson?

Arrer a trip to the hospiol ror rreatrnenr orposrarauinarie stress
symptoms, I ﬁnally reeovered from the erperienee. Tharikrully, I
managed to use the time reeovering to outline my policy on mare
ria e.

ngk: eonservatives rveryvvhere, I too believe daar rhe saneriry of
marriage is threarened by modern Amcrimn eulruie. To be quite

honest. l rhink ronservarives are operating on a supreme inrelleeiual
level when they jusriry polieies oii suds grounds as "it was Adam and
Eve, net Adam and Steve.“ Just let the eloquenee and legieal muo—
nality ofrhose words sink in for a second How
ever. 1 don'r rhmk conservatives (akc rhc arml-
ogy to creation far enough.

After all. is wasn’t a 95eyeai-eold Adam and a
20-year-old Eve (pour out a 40 for our fallen
soldier sirom). lr wssri’r Adam gerring married
to Eve, hooking up with ayoungerlane and then
divorcing Eve on her llOSPlLll bed while she's
suirering from eaneer (sorry for harm Newr
Giiigrieh) And finally, itwasanvegetting preg—
nanr from Adam. but then dumping him be.
cause she thought she liked Ross, when. in rail-
iry. she loved Chandler,

unroriunatdy. InAmcncd rat too many mar-
riages operate under sueh immoral circume
ssanccs. Mom than halfofall American marriages end in divorce and
the number is even higher iryou live in the Bible Belt Clearly, the
people are speaking with a uniﬁed voioe rhar marriage is little more
than a burden for pursuing more interesting rhings sueh as what
Jay z onee aptly desenbed as money, eash. hoes To preserve the
sanetiry or marriage and maintain the rreedom tharAmerieans have
elearly demonstrated they mm, 1 propose a eonsritiirional amend
merit tharelearly deﬁnes marriageas a union between two non Amerie
eons.

And, ﬁnally, it wasn’t
Eve getting pregnant
from Adam, but then
clumping him because
she thought she liked
Ross, when in reality she
loved Chandler.

No longer will rhe powerhil. bigored homosexual lobbydcny the
right ro remain single to heterosexual Amerieaias who are soeially
pressured into marriage. This ronsriturional amendment will ilshcr
in a new era oreoiialiry by making sure thar all
Amerieans, regardless of sex, raee. ethnieiry or
sexual orlenrnrlon. rcmrllli liberarcd from the
oppression ormarriage.

under my vision, Ameriean eollege snidenis
will no longer have re eome home to questions
ofwhether they have found a prospeetive lire
partner instead, they ran share the truth abour
the gratifieation orrandom hookups (or, in my
ease, the legitimaey or suppressing all sexuality
by playing NCAA Football 2004 for 18 hours a
day).

IFI 1m clcttcd president. the maﬁa-dimmed
consortium ofruxedo renrnl stores, bridal shops
and wedding planners will be dismantled and
rlieir eriminal operations broughr to a halr. Reception Dir who at
temp: to conrlmlc rheir life ofrelllngjokcs ovcr ourdared music Wlll
promptly be deported to France.

Perhaps best ofall, my poliey on marriage will iesrore dignity and
decency to she world of lulcvlslon. just think. one: {he burden of
covering J. Lo and Ben; Niels and Jessica; and Carmen and Dave is
llfrcd. MTV oan finally srarr playing music videos again.
