Doughatty

from p. 1 “His work was

just so instrut
inental in giving LGBT students 1 Vulce."The
LGBT Student Seivices ofﬁce named its an»
nual Ally Award after Dougharty rollowing
Doughartvs departure from the university.

Xrter Iowa St1te, Dough1rty went to work
for his 1lm1 m1ter, the University of Puget
Sound, as Assocmte Dean of Student Sets
vices.

Doughﬂrty created an alteinative spring
break trip there where he would travel with
students to New York ench year to see plays
and museums. He also helped to 1eo1g11ize
sttident orientation, and introduced a new
“parentorientatiouf'

This orientation, which 11trod11ces puenrs
to the transition of theii children, “became
kind of the iconic urban legend about Hour
ton,"s1\id current University of Puget Sound
Dean ofStttdents Mike
Seguwu. “It combined
his love for this institu-
tions with his passion
for theater and perfor—
mance."

This orientation

was noted beyond the
university. Dough-
1rty would move on to
Lewis and Clark Colt
lege after Puget Sound.
Lewis and Clark Provost Jane Monnig Ate
kinson said that after hiring Dougharty to he
Lewis and Clark's dean of students, a faculty
member pulled her aside at lunch.

“The faculty member told me that he and
his wife had taken their eldest son up to UPS
for orientation five years before," Atkinson
said.“There had been a morning session led by
a dynamie associate dean. And my colleague
leaned over and said to his wife, ‘We need him
at Lewis and Clark.”1

In two years at Lewis and Clark, Doughs
arty oversaw major ehanges at the administra—
tive level. Atkinson said that in her opinion,

 

the changes have “ensured greater clarity on
the part of people 11 other ofﬁces" and have
“enabled us to function bettei as an organiza-
tion." Doughluty was also instrumental in the
renov1rions otLewis and Clark’s slightly runs
down student CEHIL’L

At Lewis 11d Clarkand beforc,Dougharty
was noted for his engagement with students.
He always showed up at spornng events and
frequently hosted events for students at his
home. Sarah DiSabatino, the editor- in- -chief
of the Lewis and Clark student newspaper,
The Pioneer Log, said that Doughnrty is “very
friendly with students, and very open to
meeting with them.A lot ofsttidents have met
or had lunch with him."

Despite the warm relationships with coir
leagues and friends, students do not always
agiee with Deugluury Disabitino said that
some students hnd felt that 1tter Dougharry's

arrival, punishments
given out to. ding and
alcohol offenses had
increased,
Angela Finite, the
student goveinment
Vice President, igreed
that “there have been
some concerns brought
up this year with re-
gatds to our code of
Conduct, what students
are getting written up for ‘in terms ofdiugs and
1leol1ol on e111pus."1t is unclear what role. it
any, Deugharty had in this change, which Fin
ke characterizes as “an onsgomg bone of con-
tention" between students and administrators.
Dougharry told the 3ch that he has no agenda
regarding drug and alcohol at Grinnell.

More than particular changes, however,
students and administrators remember Dought
arty for his personality. Laura BestlersWilcox
worked under Dougharty at Iowa state, and
said that Dougharty was “very funny."

Students may be stnick by Dougharty’s
openness. Student government President Au-

Irn 17m in g VP Doug/r1101. Com RIHU| )

try Liggctr remembered fondly a (lav ti ip that
Doughartil had led fioin Poitland to Seattle
foi an nativity play. Students and Doualiartv
made the three hour drive together 11 11111.

“There are very few administiatots,1 think,
who could take a van ofstudents on a road trip
and not have it be super awkward or tense in
the c1r,"l.iggerr said.

After the play, Dougharty took the stu-
dents out for hurge1s, fries and shakes, which
Liggett said “sort of represents who he is in
terms of eating, in terms of reaching out and
bringing people together."

What many students may notice most
about Dougharty, however, is his peculiar rash-
ion sense. He loves Birkenstocks, wool socks
and shorts, and wears his outfit in all weather.
Expect to see him hiking through Grinnell’s
January snows, legs bare below the knees.

“He really doesn’t Like the cold," said Penny
Rice, whom Daugherty hired in 1998 at Iowa
State. "[But] ifhe could, he would wear shorts
every single day of his Life."
