4:40 am. I am awakened
by my strange internal
clock which often wakes
me up right around this
time. I must have been
a dairy rarmer in a
previous life. I ﬁnd it
hard to get back to
sleep but manage to
doze a little, I Worked at the Reference Desk in
hurling from 7:00 to about 10:15 on Monday evening

downstairs. Ithen head to the basement to clean the
cat box.
7:15 am. l-iave breakfast (Cheerios and orange juice).
7:45 a.m. Grifﬁn is deﬁnitely under ﬁre weather. He
still wants us go to kindergarten, but my wife, Laura,

ﬁrst part of the day.
8:20 a.rn.1 leave for Grinnell, about 20 minutes later
than usual. Itis 21 miles ﬁoril our house in Newton to

usually takes approximately 30 minutes to get to
Grinnell.
8:50 a.rll. Arrive at Darby.

circulation desk is not working~the mouse and
keyboard are both dead. I crawl under the desk and

ﬁrst Science Library st/udent worker of the day arrives.
9:15 am. A student stops by seeking an article or
other publication that describes a certain method for
preparing a chemical substance. We write down the
particulars, and I tell her that I hope to be able to do
some searching a little later that morning. ill get
hack to her via e-mail.
9:30 arm, 1 attack my accumulated e-rnail. Since I
left after 10 last night, there are 133 new message;
ninety—eight percent of them are spam. The anti-spam
Software catches about 80 and I wade through the
rest of the new messagﬁ marking the spam as I go. I
send and respond m various legitimate e-mail
messages. 1 resolve yet again not to let e-mail rule my
working life.
10 a.m. I go to Hurling to collect materials to show
the Library Research Techniques class during ajoint
presentation with my colleague. Deb Martzahn, this
afternoon. I then return to the Science Library to

assemble my materials, start the computer, and
otherwise get ready for the presentation in the HF.

How would you respond to curveyr rhar

1 would trcad lightly with agreeing with Lil:
sraremcnr that Grinnell college doesn’t produce
leaders. 1 rhlnlc mosr Grinnell smdcnrs don’t warn
to rhrnlr ofthcmxclvcs as ropdown leaders. But
1 think we rend ro attract prerry independent»
minded people who probably do end up being.
rhough they may not wanr ro be called it. in so .
sranrial leadership positions. 1 see more alums
than probably anyone else here, and there’s an
awful lor of people our rhcrc in :xecutlvc-rype
positions. 1 think thcre'rc doing 1r in a socially»
conscrousway. 1r's nor like rhey jettison why rhey
came here. 1 don’t think we attract people who
say “1 wanr to be CEO or. big company"_1
think there's some rrurh ro that. But a lot orrhcm
and up In positions like that, and 1 think rhey
do a grear job.

What is your vision ofth: ideal Grinnell of
the future, and what parh mighr be rahen ro
sccure 1r?

1 think our mission smrcmenr, cnbbed from
rhc original charrcr of rhc college, is perfecr. 1
rorally agree wlrh it. Thar-s what oughr ro be rhc
rururc of rhc college. 1'm nor sure we've always
succeeded at it in rhc peer, 1'm nor sure we're
rorally succeeding ar 1r righr now. But ir ought
ro be our goal.

1f someone comes here and says “rm com»
ing hereto become a compurcr relcnnsr and that's
my only goal in life," and rhcy comc our ofhcrc
and that’s all rhcy wanr ro do. 1 think we’ve failed.
That’s nor whar rhis is all abour. if you come
here and say “1 don’t know what 1 want ro do"
and you leave and you majored computer sci.
ence and you start a software company. and you
care abour the people in your neighborhood. and
you're on active, engaged manager. 1 rhinlc we've
succeeded, It’s not an anti-vocational thing; 1
think we have broader aspirations rhan that. You
should come here, nor .urr because of us, bur
because of inrcracring wirh each orhcr and rhc
erhor otrhc place and rhc educational program.
You should come our with rhc tools to lead a
fulﬁlling lrfe rn every way, nor just on your job.
