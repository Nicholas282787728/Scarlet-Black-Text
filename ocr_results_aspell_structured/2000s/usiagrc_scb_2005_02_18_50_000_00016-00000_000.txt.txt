per caper

The taper—a time before the final meet when
swimmers lighten rheir workload in practice to
have more energy for the meet~is a ﬁckle aspect
of swimming. Individual swimmers need different
amounts of rest before the season's ﬁnal meet, a
difﬁcultjob for any Coaching staff, let alone one
with literally dozens of swimmers on the roster.

"The taper was very effective this past year, and
the reason has not to do as much with what we did
with the taper, as much as what we did with the

_ team throughout the season," assistant coach Alex

Kuhn said. “One area we emphasized much more
than in years past was their strength and flexibil-
ity as well as their anaerobic work. This type of
training put a lot of stress on the swimmel’s body
throughout the season, but at the same time, was
allowing their nervous systems to adapt to their
goal race speeds."

In additional to technical skill was the team's
newfound psychological edge.

”A large part or why the taper went so well is
because of how close the team became after get»
ting back from Florida," Brett McMilliah '05 said.
"In past years, when we got back from ourtraining
trip, people on the team would be at each other’s
throats. That didn't happen this year. and as a re-
sult, the team held together really well all the way
up to Conference.“ —.7u5tin Wallace
