Grab and Go’s illustrious legacy

Once rrpon n time or Grirmcll College, there was a meal equiva-
lcncy program called Grab and Go which provrricd busy snrdcnrs
with sustenance when they could not make it to the dining hall for
a mcal thn the collcgc dccrdcd ro build a big new campus ccnrcr,
students frcrred rhar their beloved Crab
and Go would be eliminated.They put
up such a fuss that Smdents were led to
believe (hat l\ Crab and Go cqui lent
would be provided, and they rcyoiccd
that meal cquivalcncy was savcd. Even
‘rfstudents had to give up other things
they loved about Grinnellilikc O‘uad
and the Forum—at least they would
still have Crab and Go.

We’ll be the f‘ust to admit that dc-
spitc being largely politically progressive, Grinncllinns don't really
like change in their everyday lives.The college could propose sun-
day breakfast in bed for every srudcnr and we would complain that
it was an invasion or our privacy and unbearably parcrnalisric.

When Grab and Go replaced Express, we com laincd, and
then we got used to it and started to love Grab and 0. We loved
Crab and Go because of its convenience, but also because Connie
always brightened up our day and because on warm sunny days, we
could eat our lunch on Cleveland Beach,

But the Grab and Go replacement—Outerakcssis different
from Grab and Go in more Lhan just name.

Grab and Go was convcnicnrly open during lunch and dinr
ner hours, providing an actual meal replacement. Outrtilkes is open
mostly during the times when students are in class. Outrrakes is

pint of the Grille (csscntinlly the “Ncw Forum") and unlike Grab
and Go,whcrc students could walk through rind choosc what food
rhsy warned, Grille cmployccs bag rho meals. Thcrc arc only roun-
rain drinks with lids, which you can'r really rhrrnv in your bag for .
later unless you want wet, sticky text
books, and rhcrc isn't always a vegan
option.

We're glad there is some sort of
meal equivalencyiourrtakes is better
rhan norhing. Bur the elimination of
Crab and Go as we knew it is indicar
rivc ofa larger problem than the loss of
baby carrors in Spongebob bags. Too
often the administration blatantly 3g.
nores student opinion. Four years ago,
when space usage was ﬁnalized rn rhc Campus Center, Gmb and
Go didn't exist No space was reserved for it in the new facility.

Once students did become aware rlmr there would be no Grab
and Go in rhe campus Center, rhcy made their opinion known
rhrough several channels, Last spring, over 97 percent ofsmdents
who voted for srudcnt iniriativcs vorcd in favor ofpreserving Crab
and Go. In surveys conducrcd by Dining Services, students indir
cared they supported the preservation of Crab and Go.

A newspaper serves as the (us: record ofhistory, and the S83
is largely rhc memory ofGrinnell College.Wc want it remembered
that there once was a thing called Grab and Go and it was good.
We'll get used ro Out—takes. our nostalgia for Grab and Go is
not crippling. What we won’t get used to is a disregard for student
opinion when it does not fit into a shiny new building.

Wrapped in a riddle?

c l a s s m c it
who would
dcign ro
speak with inc only scorned [0 talk about W/mt Grimm/[tr Mic. And
of course, I learned moi-c from those impromptu mcnior sessions
rlmn Grinncll necessities like,“Nevcr for the love of God call it the
Alumni Rccirarion Hall,"or how ro play Moose.

I learnt an arrirude,roo. Here’s the Grinnell attitude as it seemed
ro me during those rrrsr couple ofwecks: You stay up late, you have
“random hookups" at Harris, you complain about your work, you
post alternatively snide and depressive sentences on Plans and as
quickly as you can you stop being so damn cheerful.

I might be exaggerating, but at the time I felt like I was the only
person at Grinncll who had failed to learn these lessons instantly
and painlessly. It took me a while to notice that upperclassmen
didn‘t think that Grinnell College was some optimistic fairy-castle
where brilliant teachers taught brillianr students and where people
liked to listen to my cheerful long monologues about what me and
my tricnds did back home.

When I ﬁgured this out, it felt like I was in one ofthosc dreams
where I’m giving some speech in class and rhcn I reduce in a single
flash otpcrrcct logic thar rm naked in from orcvcryonc (including,
inorplicably, cx-girlfncnds
and grandparents) and I rry
ro hidc my nakedness but of
course it doesn't work and
cvcrybodysccs me for wharr
really am, a fnkcrAand than
it turns out nor to be a dream
or all and I can never live it
down, One of those dreams,

As the arrival ofrhc ncw firstrycars promprs us oldcr Griuncllians
ro sporriugly lccrurc rhc 1i nlc ones on What Grimm” it trial hopc in
also will inspire us ro ask ourselves: What is Grinuell like, exactly?
Whar actually marrcrs ro us? Really, What docs it mean to be a
Grinnelliirn?

Easy answer: 835,730 a year.

Harder answer. I have no idea.

Bur wait, before 1 launch into some wellrinrenrioncd riff in
which 1 provide a provisional answer to rhis qucsrion dcspirc my

The arrival ofthe new ﬁrst-years
prompts its older Grime/lions to
iportl‘ng/y letture the little ones on
’What Grinnel/ l5 like.’

admrrrcd rgnorarrrs, i should maybe explain more orrvhyl think rts
answer may be more unporranr to us than the answers we end up
rvrrrrrrg on our anrhro rural.

In class, we learn heir to be in class. We 1e earn how to do our
reading, wrrrc cssays rhmk and caprcss our rlroughrs clcarlr (hope
tully):rrll skills rha may bc rmporrarrr In larcr his but as ofnghr
now, are of use only in the classroom (use conrcxnializc in a sentence
arrravlrcrc outside of dc1tlcmlrl even as a inks, and see how people
look at vou).

Bur once we graduarc, wc don’r have class anymore and we will
be lcfr rvirh rwo big things: work and rhc rcsr ororu livcs.

And that qucsrion—Vthr does it mean to be a Grinnellinn?—
really just asks us abour lrow we live our lives oursidc otclass.When
we risk that question of ourselves, will we be colnforrablc with our
answer> Docs being a Grinncllian mcan, ro you, grinding to “Like A
Prayer?" Docs ir moan gerring a fir-srsycar girl drunk at Gerbil chr?
Does ir mean some srrcssrul rush of juggling your reading and your
papers and your extra—cur-
riculars whilc srill managing
ro find rimc to eat, maybc,
but not to sleepidon'r even
ask abour having fun?

Is there something in rho
Grinnell student body that
sees rhc firstryears smiling
and feels disgusted> Doesn't
the same part, when those
same firsrrycars’ faces look
dull and pal: from ﬁnals week, feel relieved, almost pleased? Is that
the Grinnell we want to pass down) Is that the Grinnell we want
ro livc in.> And, importantly, are we the Grinncllians we want to be
when we’re stuck with ourselves, all those years after graduation?

For me Grinnell is about growing up. It‘s about getting hurt,
feeling lonely and slowly making friends, than learning how to treat
rhosc friends in the ways they deserve. It’s about falling, about dO’
ing a thousand things I rcgrorrsd. It’s about struggling with work,
and wirh rhc suspicion my work is utterly meaningless and that the
profs don’r even bother to read my essays anyway. And ﬁnally it’s
abour waking up on: day to [col comt’orrablc and hopeful rvirh it all,
dcspirc everything.

Does that answer What (for: it mum to he a Grime/Iran? I don't
rhink so. But I’d like ro hear what you have re say (Gimmick alert).
So email me your answer to WIMI rim 1'; [til/Ill [0 b: a Gr't'lmeI/imt in
60 words or less and I’ll rry to print it in the next column, anony-
mously if you’d like, and ralk about ir.

And rhar moans cvcrybodyewidc-cycd first-your to scnloriris-
stricken senior. Even ifyou don't o-mail nrc,l hope you can come up
with an answer you can really 1ch with. Because when this Grinnell's
over and done wirh,you'll have rot

l learned more from these
lmpmmptu mentorsesilons than
Grime/l necessities like, ”Never for
the love of the love tifGod (all it
the Alumni Rec/ration Hall.”
