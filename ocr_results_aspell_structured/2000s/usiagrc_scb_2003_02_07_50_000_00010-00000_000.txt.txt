HI, I‘M THE BREAKUP Finley,
HEkE TO MAKE vcu HAPPY I

SHE SAID SHE DIDN’T EVER
WANT TO SEE MY FACE AGAIN.

HOW CAN I BE HAPPY?

What about Bob’s?

"'somh osvvell

Last night 1 went to the Forum, and every last table was full of
students. Last week 1 went to Bobs, and it was just me and some
bagel named Leslie Why is this so? Why isn’t Bob’s the place to be
anymore? 1 remember in my younger days, when I went to holds
for everything, from asking someone out, to dumping people.
“Hey,“ is what we would say in the old days, “you want to go to
Bob’s?" or, sometimes, “I’m going to Bob's: want to come with?"

I don‘t understand the pull ortho Forum. It Licks the music,
comes, and art. I can hesryour resorts now,
and I can tell you that they are based on a
number of myths, :issumpnons, and lies
which l will shatter one after the enter.

. .Bur the Forum is ccntmllylncatcd!”
Well, Jesus, iryou think central Location is
so important, why don't you go ahead and
suggest that we tear down or close every»
thing on campus and move it to some sort

can quuich your every want and need faster
than you can say, “I think Carleton’s done
that already." Walk the extra 50 yards to

“...But Bob’s lacks oversized baked
products!” Yes, I'll admit that Bob's doesn't
boneht from the gravity-like pull ortho Big cookie. In root, Bob‘s
doesn’t even have the gravity—unlike pull of the Small Cookie. But
Bob‘s does have vegan Crack, a frozen treat that is not only just as
good as any dessert product, but it also doesn't murder innocent
milk and butter, throwing on the delicate south American dairy
ecosystem. And iiyoti really want to spend some time with haked
goods, hung out with the guy behind the counter.

It really is fascinating to
watch a full—grown vegan
take down and devour the
slow and lame Tofutti
cuties, and then bask on
one of the nearby couches,
licking the remaining soy
off of his face.

..But Bob’s coffee is more expensive than Fomm coneel"
True, but Bob's coneo doesn't taste as much Like slosveroasted shit.
Ifyou’r: just drinking oohoo to stay awake, you should switch ovci
to more effective stimulants, like speed,

“...But open Mic night isn’t worth the stack ofconseouent
therapy bills!” While both performing at and attending Bob’s
open Mic night can be painiul and traumatic, I always get plot.

Calendar cris '5

Dear Lettitors Editor,
lam writing about the crinnell College ulcndan We received
one each oithe past three years. They were handsome calendars,
with pictures oithe campus and photogenic people, dates oflmcr—
est (civic, religious and collegiate) and room to write things. But
no more, We waited for the 2003 calendar. it never come. We
round out the College decided to stop printing it Or maybe the
College decided to stop sending them to parents and alums (we're
both). Maybe it was cost cutting, Maybe it was ennui, All 1 know
is that by the rimel realized there would be no Grinnell College
calendar all that was lcfi: to choose from was Pokemon, NASCAR
and hunting dogs. I luv: hunting dogs, The dogs are nice enough,
but in hair the pictures the dog is holding a dead bird of some
kind in is mouth Please join me in calling for the return oithe
Grinnell College calendar,

always enjoyed dining there only last week, Amy Slieheck '03
and I shared a delicious Michael’s pitta, contrary to the expell-
ente reported in the review, the waitress gave to the option oisit.

appropriately?

The stair at Michael: has been nothing short of hospitable
whenever I hove come in ind l rind the atmosphere to be Coly.
Paglisti's is good. but it can be such .i scene at times, Why did the
reviewers feel so ourohplnca I highly doulst that there was a “men-
acing posse" ready to pounce on them. h is sad thar some college
students choose to perpetuate stelcorypes .ilsour “routines," Per
