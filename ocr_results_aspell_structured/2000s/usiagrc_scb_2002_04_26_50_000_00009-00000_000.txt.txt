Spreading blame in the great sign debate

well, it's been about ﬁve months since my last column
on signage seen in the loggia, and after the backlash i got
iron. that I'd like to say than 1 learned my lesson from the
experience. i havent been tearing down airy signs. in any
ease, so 1 at least took that much away from the haseo.
However, the Etc! ma. i am writing mull/1:7 eolriinn

pletely stupid

in seine cases, though, sheer amounts of ram

have met this triireal stupidity mass, and
thus will be the cause orrhe hate marl 1 get from writing this
column, so it goes.

i don't have a problem with Take Back the Night as a
program at all; in raet, i am hilly aware orirs necessity not
rust in crinnell but in the nanen as a whole, because rape is
a mayor problem in rhis eoiintry. However, as wlrh the sign
described in my earlier eolumn, I do have an evtreinely rnae
rot problem with the eontenr presentation on this latest erop
ofsigns, which do nothing but promote rear, siispreion, and
uiiirecessary guilt,

Saying that one in rout female eollege students is raped
during college (which, incidentally, is probably a inisinter.
preted statistre, but well ignore rhat her for now) has its use
in letting women know that they are at risk. Phrasing this
statement in sueh a way eh. niplies that itwill be yoirrouad.

notes from the underground

date rape is good iir letting women loiuw what to waieh rut.
suggesting that the potential due rapist is that kid down the
hall leads to the exrrcmcly wuntcr-prodncnvc suspicion of
all men as potential rapists.

'l‘hese signs do not suggest ways in which women
can proteet themselves or get help in a potentially dan.
gerous situation; they demonize men and make every.
one ihat mueh yurnprer Moreover, these kinds orsigns
steal attention from the Sign: thatdr offer ways in which

women (and men, for that matter) can help fight

against rape, and thus detract from the overall
cause they are trying to
promote

the definition ofrape or who has been raped herselr. ln cl-
rher ease, they need to be aware.

My suspicion is that atsorne point, both parties and their
respeerive :pniogisu lost sight ofwhat this week is supposed
to be about. That, for thoscofyouwith short attention spans,
is the prevention or
tape and support for
rovienms.TakcBack
the Night is not
about which gender
has the moral high
ground orabout who
is distorting which
statistics. At its very
core, Take Back die
Night is supposed to
bring theproblem or
tape into the oollcce
rive consciousness,
then provide srraregies for defeating that problem.

Pointless dcmmiiurion, attacks on others' statistics, and
defenslvercdcrionnry responses to implications are not go.
ing to help victims or potential vrerims ofrape information
about what people can do, who people can talk to, and what
has been accomplished will give people hope, but only if
they are not canceled out by the hostilities seen this year.

lrpeople are really serious about eliminating rape, their
information relaring to'leke back the Night and related pro.
grams should promote an atmosphere in which victims, po.
teniial vittims, and yes. even men can hold an intelligent
discourse on the subjcct. Tint atmosphere seeins sadly ab.
sent in crinnell this spring

The people who then
posted the signs noting
how many men were not
rapists missed the point
of Take Back the Night
entirely.

About Rube s Steakhouse Gri

TVPE: Midwestern steakhouse

-it-yourself fun!

Prater rrrrrss: About 5.20 per person. Salad, potato and bread are
included in the steak price,

Wan TIME: You decide. 5 minutes for drinks.

totarion: ln Montour, Iowa. Go north out of Grinnell on 12.6,
and a few miles past Gilman there's a right turn to Montour.
The way to Rube’s is well sign-posted. It's about 20 minute
drive.

Rankings

Foon
Ariel: vou will like Rube's as much as you like eating steak,
and being in control of your own steak. Any ranking I give will
only reflect my personal preferences.

Kate.- Ditto—rt also depends on how good you are at grilling.

Surrourrprrrcs
Ariel: 0/5. I couldn't see that Montour had anything to
recommend it other than Rube’s.

Kate: 5/5 There is nothing like grilling a steak with to strangers.

Vromhun

Ariel: 0/5. They try; there are mushrooms you can grill, and of
course the salad bar, toast, and potatoes, in fact everything
but the steak is vegetarian. But I’d discourage vegetarians
from bothering to go. They don’t even have tofu steaks.
Kate: 0/5 Sorry we will try better next time.

OVERALL
Ariel: 5/5. Delicious beer, steak and atmosphere,
Kate: 3/5

And. I’d like re apologrre to our vegetarian read.
ers for this week's column; a review of Rubc's is ur-
terly useless to someone who doesn't like to ruelt into
a big, juicy steak out ifyou are a alrnlvom like me,
this is definitely a good plaee to go, and yet another
quintessentially rowan experience. Rules

At lsiibe’s you cook your own steak. This is im.
portarit to understand, as it's halt the eharm or the
place

Karo: Personally, i wouldn’t know a medium rare
steak irir hit me, so 1 was fortunate to have the help
and guidance ofcus Torres. who is from Texas and
thus has known how to cook the perfect steak since
birth. There is no menu at Rnbc'wafru they take
your drink order, they take you over to the rcfrlgcmr
tor case, where you can choose a sieak, pork thop,
shrimp grill, or, for the adveniurous patron, the 2
inch thick hamsteak lirarn stealer. Yourdiniier comes

with unlimited salad bar, the best baked beans 1 have

ever had, unlimited baked potatoes. and as much Tcxas
toast as you tare to grill

The main idea behind Rubcs is that they let you

grill your steak yourselrat a giant grill pit. [ secretly

think that this is so that you cant complain that your

steak is done incorrectly, but i have a feeling

ihat it leads to a lot orrurned meat Anyway,

you are free to reason your steak and cook it

testament to the quality of Rubc's steak.

Ariel Don't forget to season your steak with gate
liesalr, melted butter, and the other tendiments they
have around the grill pir. Also. each table has a bottle
orthe house steak sauce, and the local beer (brewed
in Amana, lowa) is really good. The interior has a

Titular Head was stupid

Grinnell College’s student body never misses an
opportunity to testify against itself, and last Friday’s
film festival was no exception 70 minutes of
bloodless, contrived films, void of oncercommon
audience screamery, left are bored and depressed.
Titular Head's organizers, who denied a handful of
ﬁlms from the festival (cowardly and falsely citing
”time contraints"), directed or starred in
approximately a quarter of the ﬁlms, Vawwwn. Since
when did lame satires of popular culture and topical
references to orinnell life (”Hey—ewouldn’t it be
hilarious if we put President Osgood in our ﬁlm?!")
pass for creativity or entertainment? Why must we
be made constantly to expect less and less of life at
this miserable zoo? Madame Grinrlell is menstruating
piteously all over the ground, and we are left to choke
on the vapid dust of our circumstance.

Hide the praspres from Harris
I received an email that security had "cleared up
the issue” of barring prospies who are under 18 from
Harris, ”Clearing up" means stating that "if the pm—
specl‘ive students are under 18, please advise them to
not try to get into parties in the Harris center where
alcoholis involved." Here's my question: how are prospies
supposed to get a View of what Grinnell is like if they
Can't even get into Harris? First, not all Grinnell Stu-
dents are even 18 and what is the point of the wrist
band system if underage people aren’t allowed in any»

whatI can do that weekend? Nexttirne I have a pmspie,
