Just as indifference is the opposite of love, the opposite of
indifference is memory.

In the dark times
Will there also be singing?
res, there will be singing
About the dark times,
—dertolt Brecht

Ianl not resigned to the shutting away of low'ng hearts in
the hard ground.

50 it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of
mind:

Into the darkness they go, the vnse and the lovely,
Crowned with lilies and with laurel they go: but i am not
resigned.

Lovers and thinkers, intu the earth with you.

Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.

.A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,

A formula, a phrase remains e but the best is lost.

The answers ouick and keen, the honest look. the laughter,
the love, _

They are gone. They are gone to reed the roses. Elegant and
curled

Is the olossom. rragrant is the blossom. i know. But I do
not approve.

More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses
in the world.

Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave

Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the klrid',

auietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.

I know. But I do not approve. And 1 am not resigned.
—Edrm St. Vincent Milloy, "Dirge without Music"

’ Who will take me

home,

vhere the creek falls
asleep

in long drawe

. of syllables

of water, not of words?
This puace is gorging

. words like lotus lilies.

I’ll fall asleep on words,
belly fat,
and wake up with an ulcer,
who will take me
home.
where toads and cnckets
wreathe the rivers ways,
cioaking
like toads and cncketsr

No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a part of
the continent, a piece of the whole. Any man's death
diminishes me oecause i am involved in mankind

4min Donne, "Meditation XVII

‘ look to this day, for it is life. in its brief course lie all the
realities and verities of existence, the bliss of growth, the
splendour of action, the glory of power. For yesterday is out

‘ "a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision, hut today, well

lived, makes yesterday a dream of happiness and every
tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well, therefore to this day.

Do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there, 1 do not sleep.
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
ram not there, 1 did not die!
iMary Frye, ”Andre’s Prayer"

1, an expert in human passions,
Composed this collection of songs, where every verse
Is full to the brim with black sorrow,
For I detest these passions in myself.
I wrote so that my words could reach
People in all torners of the earth,
I wrote for those who only enter life
As well as for those who have lived and matured,
Forthose completing their earthly Journey
rlnd stepping overthe fateful limit.
I wrote for the righteous and far sinners,
For the comforting and the inconsolahle,
For the judging and the convicted,
For the penitent and those enslaved by sin,
For dosgaoders and villains,
Fur virgins and adulterers,
For all: the highebom and the godless,
nowhtrodden slaves and grand princess.
Iwrute equally for husbands and wives,
For the degraded and those risen high,
For rulers and for the oppressed,
For abusers and for the abused,
ror those who give comfort and those who are comforted,
lwrote equally for those on horseback and on foot,
For the insigniﬁcant and for the great,
for city-dwellers and half-savage highlanders,
And for him who is the supreme ruler,
whose judge is God alone,
For people who are vain and those who are pious,
ror monks and holy heimits.
May these verses, full of my suffering,
Become a guidance to someone.
May one who repents a black transgression
Find comfort in my writings,
May someone turn to their good
My work, my zeal.
May my verse, turning into a prayer and a supplication,
Elitit God's mercy.
iErEWry of Merck, from the Book of lamentations

My heart is oneved hy all I cannot save
So much has been destroyed;
I have to cast my loss with all those
who age after age
with no extraordinary power
reconstitute the world.

Excellent, more excellence is borrowing and slanting very
slanting is light and secret and a recitation and emigration.
Certainly shoae are shallow and nonsense more nonsense is
sullen. Very little cake is Water, very little Cake has that
escape.

Sugar any sugar, anger every anger, lover sermon lover,
centre rlo distractDi, all order is in a measure.

left over to he a lamp light, left over in victory, left over
in saving, all this and negligence and bent wood and more
even much more is not so exact as a pen and a turtle and
even, certainly, and even a piece of the same experience as
more.

To consider a letture, to consider it well is so anxious
and so much a charity and really supposing there is grain
and ifa stubble every stubble is urgent, will there not be a
chance of legality. The sound is sickened and the price is
purchased and golden what is golden, a clergyman, a single
tax, a currency and an inner chamber.

76211de Stern, from Tender Buttons

 

I can't say everything about it

In just one single song

Ican't out how i feel ina package

Arid sell it back to everyone

But wait, there's another boy genius who's fucking gone

I hope the food tastes better in heaven

I know there's lots of rad gueer boys up there

And r hope that even time they talk to you

They know that theyre lucky to be your friend

'(ause look there's another boy genius who’s fucking gone
And I wouldn’t be so fuckin’ mad, so fuckin’ pissed off

if it wasn't so fucking wrong

Its all fucking wrong

rrs nor FAIR, rrs NOT FAIR, Irs noT FAIR, n's noT FAIR
But no one said lite was easy

Veah, but no one said

No one said that nothings s'posed to happen, right?

No, no one told me anything to prepare me for fucking this
There’s another boy genius who’s fucking gone

Don’t tell me it don’t matter

Don’t tell me it don’t matter

Don’t tell me I've had three days to get over it

It won’t go away

It just won't go away

—liikini Kill, “uh"

I am a thousand winds that blow.
1 am the diamond glint on snow,
1am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn rain.

When you wake in the morning hush,
tom the swift, uplirting rush or quiet birds in circling
flight.

I am the soft starlight at night.

Do not stand at my grave and weep.
Iain notthere, I do not sleep,
Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there, I did not die!
iMary Frye, "Andres Prayer“

We are loved by an unending love.
We are embraced by arms that ﬁnd us
even when we are hidden from ourselves.
We are touched by ﬁngers that soothe us
even when we are too sad for soothing,
We are counseled by voices that guide us
even when we are too embittered to hear.
We are loved by an unending love.
We are supported by hands that uplift us even the midst of
a fall.
We are urged on by eyes that met us even when we are
too confused for meeting.
We are loved by an unending love.
Embraced, touched, soothed, and counseled .
Ours are the arms, the fingers, the voices;
Ours are the hands, the eyes, the smiles.
We are loved by an unending love.

indoor Romi M. Shapiro, Kol honeshomoh

My heart is grieved by all I cannot save
So much has been destroyed,-
I have to cast my loss with all those
who age arterage
with no extraordinary power
reconstitute the world.
