SOL celebrates Chavez Day

HV DAVID LOGAN

Though Cesar Chavez died lo years
ago, his activist spirit was alive and well
at Grinnell College on Tuesday. as mem
bers of Student Organization of Latinos/
Latinas (SOL) commemorated the 82nd
anniversary of the late lahor organizer and
civil rights activist’s birthday,

Chavez ascended to national plomr
nence through his role as a labor organizer
in the American West and as a founder
of the United Farm Workers of America
(UFW). Since then, he has evolved into
an iconic figure for a bevy of social move
ments, particularly those concerned with
labor and immigration rights.

SOL President Lizeth Gutierrez '12,
who assisted with tabling outside the din
rng hall, said she felt a responsibility for
educating the campus about Chavez,

“It was interesting having people here
not knowing him at all. i couldn't believe
it actually," Gutierrez said. “1 felt it was a
certain responsibility to really inform my
peers about him because he was very imv
portant, especially in my culture and for
what he stands for as well."

After finishing the eighth grade,
Chavez dropped out of school to become
a fulletime migrant workcr alongside the
rest of his family. His activism began in
the 1950s with the Community service
Organization, a Latino civil rights group.

In 1962, Chavez helped found the Nae
tronal Farm Workers Association, the pre-
decessor to the UFW, which today is the
country's largest farm workers union and
is active in over ten states.

To iaise awareness of Chavez and his
causes, SOL members set up a table on?
side the dining hall featuring literature
and a video about the life and activities of
the late union organizer,

SOL member Lupe Rubio '10 echoed
the importance of Chavez. “We’ve known
about him since we were little. Especially
when I go back and visit my grandpa, he'll
talk about him," she said. “He makes a re
ally, ‘you should not forget who this man
is, because it's really important.”

SOL members also distributed pins
featuring the UFW logo, an Aztec eagle
inspired in part by the symbolism of the
Mexican flag and designed by Chavez's
cousin, Manuel. According to Cesar

No Limits

Chavez, the iconic symbol was conceived
of “to get some color into the movement,
to give people something they could idene
tify with Organizers estimated that over
180 students received and displayed the
pins on their clothing,

As mostpeople filedinto thcdininghall
for dinner, SOL members and other stus
dents stopped brieﬂy at the table to syma
bolically fast and reﬂect on Chavez’s work
before continuing on to dinner, The short
moments were intended to honor Chavez’s
last fast before his death in 1993.

Fasting was a central tool in Chavez’s
struggle to raise awareness ofand support
for farm workers. Chavez fasted for 25
days in 1968 and 24 days in 1972. In 1983,
Chavez fasted for 36 continuous daysihis
longest ever continuous fastito protest
the use of five pesticides on table grapes
which he contended threatened the health
ofgrapc harvesters.

Chavez was a powerful political frgure.
He was instrumental in Robert F. Kent
nedy’s victory in the California primas
ries during his abortrve 1968 presidential
campaign Chavez's grassroots organizing
spuired unprecedented tuinout among the
state's Latino voters which helped secure it
victory for Kennedy. Some commentators
have argued that Chavez's turnout aetivre
ties sowed the seeds for Barack Obama’s
successful presidential campaign.

Rubio’s family experienced Chavez’s
hands-on involvement directly. “My grande
father used to match in the Caesar Chavez
marches, because he was—him and the
rest ofrny family—were grape pickers and
lived in the farm, and they had basically no
benefits, no rights," she said, “They actu-
ally got to meet Caesar Chavez, because he
would go and investigate their standards
ofliving and how they were treated."

Organizers said they were pleased with
the group's efforts at raising awareness on
campus. “I feel like we got the word out.
The people that 1 talked to and the people
that I saw were actually interested," Rubio
said, “This school is very liberal, there's a
certain activism that interests everybody
on thrs campus, so hearing about that ac»
tually did get a lot of people’s interests."

SOL is already planning for future aCs
tivities including potentially bringing a
speaker to campus who had worked with

Chavez. In addition to the day’s activities.
the group is also soliciting signatures for a
petition advocating that Congress officials

SOL member Johana Lozano ’11. “He’s
like a Martin Luther King. We just wants
ed to spread the word. Especially since it
was his date, and also because his day is a
holiday in some states, but not in all."

able to do because the budget
cuts have been tighter.”

Osgood stressed that wrth a smaller budget the College
needs to focus on the parts of the current strategic plan it
is already attempting to implement, such as filling the four
faculty positions in the Expanding Knowledge initiative.

“I didn’t see any recognition ofwhere we are in the Cole
lege’s budget," Osgood said of No Limits letter. “i will tell
you that ifwe add a bunch of positions, somerhrng will have
to give. It will have to be the core academic program, ﬁnﬂn’
cial aid, or we're going to have to lay off people."

Osgood also said that while he supported some of the
issues the group put forth, the College cannot implement
these changes without sustained student work on the prof
ects. “When people come to me and they haven‘t invested
a lot of time or effort in doing committee work and spade
work it's hard for me to assess, shouldgl throw out our stras
tegic plan and do these things," he said.

While many students have supported the group through
signing the petition, others have shared Osgood’s concerns.
Evan Farrier '08.5, who did not sign the petition, took iss
sue with the tactics used by the group. “It is too idealistic,
especially considering what’s happening to the budget and
endowment," Ferriet said.

He also said that the demands ignore support already
offered by the administration. “I don't think it's prodno
tive, and it seems a little bit ungrateful for how many things
Grinnell students do have."

“I have a lot of respect for people in the No Limits Projs
eet," Ferricr said. “I’m sympathetic to a lor oftheir concerns.
Their methodology is my biggest criticism."

Gretel Carlson ’10 originally signed the petition, but

now worries that the group might worsen tensions with ad-
ministrators. “They need to be aware that if we have this
adult versus kid kind of mentality that 1 sec going on, or
administrator versus student, then its not going to get us
the things that we want," Carlson said.

But students involved in the project have defended the
approach taken, and particularly the use of the term ‘de—
mands.' “People have promised up front to do things, but
have failed to follow through and have continually main-
tained this outward demeanor ofagrecment, but underneath
is just a lot of resistance," said Joe Hiller'lZ. “It's sort of set-
ting a new paradigm in studenteadministrator relationships
by reasserting a voice that is more strong and less willing to
accept excuses as to why these things aren’t met."

The group’s members plan to continue the efforts they
started before break, and met throughout the past week to
discuss how to encourage the administration to implement
their demands. While still in the planning stages, accord-
ing to the minutes from a group meeting that took place
on Monday the group is focusing their future efforts on
furthering campus education among students, reaching out
beyond students to faculty and alumni, and discussing their
complaints with prospective students during the upcoming
prospective student weekends during thc month oprril.

“We’d really like to work with the administration and
move forward," Emily Stievcr ’09 said of the group’s future
plans. “But if there’s not movement on these different is-
sues, wc're definitely planning on sticking with it, and sort
of escalating our responses That’s not a threat but it’s
important that this isn’t something that willjust get dumped
to a committee and go away, because that's what kept hap»
pcning in the past.”
