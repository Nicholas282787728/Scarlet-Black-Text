Women’s basketball ends season with a win and a loss

Pioneer women finish strong at home but continue to struggle with consistency, losing their final game on the road

EV KEVIN BYRNE

An exciting victory and a disappointing defeat
ﬁnished up the regular season for Grinnell's women's
basketball team. Knox College visited Grinnell for the
last Pioneer home contest oftlie season and Grinnell
promptly handed Knox its second loss against the
Pioneers this season.

The two seniors led the way down the stretch to
secure the season sweep of the Prairie Fire, as Katy
Bowen scored a team—high 15 points and Lauren
Meredith added nine points and three rebounds.

Both Bowen and Mere
edith sank key free throws
in the ﬁnal minute to protect
Grinnell’s narrow lead on the
way to a 6359 vicrory,

Bowen ﬁnished with 15
points, ﬁve rebounds, rive
assists, two steals and one
block.

Hannah Wolf ’08 added
12 points of her own, along
with four rebounds, three as-
sists and three steals, Laura
Burton ’08 scored six points
and Emily Kolbe '07 had four
points, six rebounds and two
assists.

"It felt great to p’ k up a win in our last home
game," said Meredith This season has been up and
down for us, but to ﬁnish at home like we did feels
good, We've been working hard for along time and
it's nice to know that the hard work can pay off."

The Pioneers took their victory and went on the
road to Lake Forest College lasr Saturday for their
ﬁnal contest of the season.

Unfortunately, the women's basketball team could
not capitalize on the positive momentum from their
recent win against Knox,

The Pioneers found themselves down by eight at
halftime, but came out ofthe locker room with some
intensity and maria-ed to tie the - me with 17 mini

utcs left in regulation.

Grinnell and Lake Forest see-sawed for the better
part of the second half, but with seven minutes left,
the Foresters began to pull away

The Pioneers could not catch up to Lake Forest in
the end and fell with a ﬁnal score of90-7S.

“Lake Forest consistently outatebourlded us
throughout the game," said Bowen, “but we were
making shots and were able to keep up with them.
They went on a run midway through the second half
where we missed some shots and they had some easy
fast break laymps that we were
never able to recover from."

Bowen became Grinnell's
second alletimc leading scorer
during the game, as her 21
points were enough to push
her past Missy Sharer ’91 for
second place.

Bowen ﬁnishes her career
with 1280 points.

Wolralso had a big game
as she scored 19-points, in
cluding ﬁve threeepointers.

Burton scored six and

Meredith had ﬁve points and
three rebounds in her ﬁnal
game.
The loss gave Grinnell a ﬁnishing record of 9-14
overall (sell MWC).This last pair of games reﬂects
the unstable ups and downs that were present for
most of the season for the women’s basketball team.
The returning players will look to improve on their
consistency as well as their record when they begin
the next season.

“I think the team knows thar we didn’t always pet~
form to our greatest potential this year,"said Meredith.
“With many of the players returning, the team can
look forward to heing more experienced and poised
{or next year's season. Rebounding was deﬁnitely an
area that hurt us this year and could make the dlffCX'
ence for the team’s success in the future."
