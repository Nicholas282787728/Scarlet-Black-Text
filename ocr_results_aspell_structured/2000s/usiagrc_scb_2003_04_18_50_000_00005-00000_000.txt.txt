Local politicians draw
criticism for remarks

Grinnell’s representatives in Des Moines Caught in verbal battle while defending bills that
would have restricted adoption by single-sex couples and out funding for family planning

by Sarah Millhouse

Atter grabbing corree and donuts, about so
people sat down for presentations by state senator
Neal schuerer and State Representative Danny
Carroll at the third of [lime monthly Legislative
Coffees this spring at Grinnell's First Presbyterian
Church.

For many or the students at die April 5 eventi
attcndance was prompted by two controversial mea-
sures iii the state Legislature, as well as indignation
over reported comments at the previqu Legislative
Coffee in March.

By the satuidav roium, both measures had died
in committee. Hoivevt-i, many students and com.
munity members srill felt the need to express their
dissatisfaction, especially since schucrtr sponsoied
Senate Study Bill 1057, which Sought to restrict
homosexual: from serving as roster or adoptive par.
ents.

The other bill House File 111 would have de»
prioritiud handing to family planning and tepto»
duerive health groups that gave patients informa-
tion on abortion services.

Discussion ofSenateStiidy Bill 1057 and House
File 11 1 had also surfaced at the March 1 Legislative
Coffee. The audience that spoke was generally op»
posed to schuerers view on GLBT couples/foster
care," wrote attendee and League otwomen voters
member Rachelle LaBarge in an email “Carroll
Llﬂlmcd to know nothing about [the house ﬁle]."

A: far \S social issues are concerned both
sehueiei and Carroll stem to have very little separa-
tion ofchurch and state, LaBargc said

Sabrina Ross 04 attended the March coffee af-
ter learning about Senate Study Bill 1057 from a
group called Parents and Friends or Lesbians and
Gays. Thc ignorance was the most eye opening
part, Rosssaidotsidauererswords. After insulting
my entire identity, he said But I' in having so much
fun dcbaung these things That he Couldnt under
stand, that was so saddcning

 

After the March coitee, word spread. stonewdl
Coalition, the college’s group tor queers and queer al-
lies. sent out an email to their members and to other
campus groups. The email also reported that schuerer
commented in private conversarion that the problem
was “those Jews."

The clergyperson to whom these comments were
addressed explained their contort, “ He went into what
caused the downfall of the family, and he said that
Jews don't understand because
they only have hair the stoiy.
They only have the Old Tora—
ment, so they only know that
they sin.

“He was talking to me as a
Christian clergyperson, and he
was ﬂoored when he found out
thatl worked at the college with
all these dittoront groups. He
also said dist the problem with
Hindus is they have all these
gods, that they have it all
wrong.”

When asked during a later
telephone inrervicw, schuerer
denied making these com.
merits. “At the forum, I did not
engage in any discussion on rheOldTestamcnt or other
religions orgods," he said “What I said at the Match
meetingwas that I approach things from a Chiisriaii
worldview... Maybe oneonone i was visiting iviih
someone, but I didn't engage any orthoso issues,"

At the April meeting after presentations by
schuerer and Carroll concerning current legislation.
audience members asked questions concerning a bill

a new property tax proposal. and funding to special
education and schools with declining enrollments,

mc.

irthe weather remains cooperative, a
representative from lowa Renewable En-
ergy will set a stage run by solar power.

This weekend’s races will be a tar cry
from the First event in 1973.

The ﬁrst event involved two kegs of
beer and held opening ceremonies in the
Pub under Quad dining hall (now home
to Bob‘s underground),

opening ceremonies were followed
by the familiar Titular Head festival,
which ivas then a series orshort plays that
in later years became notoriously lewd in
their execution.

Moyer described the actual relays as
“all sorts otgooiy events. .. that were truly
anti—competitive." After awards were
given the campus gathered for a picnic
supper and Saturday night party.

As the years passed the event gained
new events and evolved into a larger spec.
tade. New additions included the Edgar
Allan Poe Film Festival, and a paradei
beginning at Main Hall, and Featuring a
kazoo marching band.

While the traditions changed, the
spirit remained constant. it remained a
time, as Moyer said, “for students... to
relax and laugh at each other."

However, in 1988. artcr the drinking
age in loiva was raised, Grinnell Relays
was absent that spring

A revival was attempted in 1995. The
organizers tricd to create a Relays event
that complied with the new, stricter ale
cohol policy. The committee tried hard
to curb the drinking that had made past
relays so our orcoiitrol,

“we were successful," said Moyer.
“maybe too successful." The event was less
popular, and Relays lapsed into another
hiatus.

Thisyear. drinking will play the same
role in Oyanabal's revamped relays, a1.
beit under a more restrictive alcohol
policy.

“The people who are running this are
mostly SGA,” said Oyanabal, “They are
most familiar with the alcohol policy."
