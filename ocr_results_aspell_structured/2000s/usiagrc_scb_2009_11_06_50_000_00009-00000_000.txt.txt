iowa’s recent transition. to industrial agricultural

The invention of the hybrid seed has contributed greatly to the transformation of agriculture in lowa over the past century.

In my last column before Fall Break, I wrote about the
first Native American and European agricultures in Iowa.
Both were quite different from the industrial agriculture of
today, which dominates Iowa, the Midwest and most ofthe
country's agricultural land.The main difference is that those
farms were diverse and they produced food. Even the farms
of the late 19th and early
20th century, which were ins
creasingly oriented towards
selling grain and eventually
mechanized by tractors, usur
ally retained crop diversity,
vegetable gardens and a varir
ety of animals. That's not to
say that farmers, especially in drier areas, did not abuse the
land.

The Dust Bowl of the 1930s, brought on by a combina-
tion of drought and bad farming practices, happened before
the introduction of the hallmarks of industrial agriculture:
hybrid/genetically modified seeds, chemical pesticides, her-
bicides and synthetic fertilizer. And the kind offood system
we have today, where year-round produce is available from
Florida and California, was already developing during this
time, enabled by the introduction of the refrigerated rail car
in the late 1300s. Brooklyn and Qieens, two boroughs of
New York City, used to have some of the most productive
vegetable land of any place in the country. In these bore
oughs, soecalled truck farms or market gardens provided the
vegetables for the people living in the city (as was the case
across the country at this time)I These farms eventually dis-
appeared in the early 1900s because they could not compete
with produce from the American south, shipped north on
refrigerated rail cars.

The most dramatic changes in Iowa agriculture, however.

took place starting in the 1930s, Although more and more
land was being planted with corn, as wheat was falling out
offavor in Iowa by the late 1800s, the yield ofcorn per acie
planted was ﬂat from 1880s to the 1930s.That all changed
with the introduction of hybrid com. I think it's a serious
oversight of Grinnell education that most students outside
of biology leave here never
learning what makes a seed
a hybrid and why that's im-
portant. Hybrid corn revolu-
tionized agriculture in Iowa.

Hybrids, in overly simple
terms, are the result of hue
man-induced
cross-pollination between two varieties of

open-pollinated seeds.

When I ﬁrst came to Iowa I didn't understand how his
dusttiai agriculture and family farming could coexist. Didn't
industrial agriculture mean the farm was run like a factory,
with a company controlling the land and hiring workers to
do the labor>

As it turns out, this type offarming or corporate agricul—
ture does exist, especially in vegetable and fruit producing ar—
eas like California and Florida, but it is not how most farms
are run in Iowa. Most farms here are owned by families or
individuals, or at least worked by families or individuals who
rcnt the land from an absentee landlord. They do, however,
practice industrial agriculture, which means that they buy

all their inputs like seeds,fertilizers,pesti-

the same species of plant that have been
intentionally inbred (self-pollinated), The
initial hybrid of this cross is then cross—pole
linntcd with another hybrid to create a "dolk
b1e-cross"hybrid. The “doublercross” hybrids
produce very high yields (known as “hybrid
vigor") but this comes as at a traderoff: seed
from hybrid plants is sterile, or ifit does grow
the resulting plant is inferior to the original

and then sell their corn and soybeans to
processors who will turn them into ani-
mal feed, industrial products (paints, inks,
lubricants, etc.) and processed food (he.
high fructose corn syrup and partially hyr
drogenated soybean oil).

All up and down rural roads through
our iowa you can see signs showing the
variety of hybrid seeds being grown and

hybrid. What this meant for farmers was

that they could now buy seed that would give

them much higher yields, but they could not save seed from
one season to plant the next season. The act of saving seeds
had been a part of agriculture since its beginnings thousands
ofyears ago and it was crucial way that farmer's retained di-
versity—each farmer had their own supply ofsecd. Farmers
now had to buy the same seed the next year from the seed
company. over the course of the 1930s, nearly all farmers
in Iowa adopted hybrid corn seed and stop growing the old,

Response to last week’s letter

Diversity is, unquestionably, a crucial
aspect of the Grinnell community. As a
representative body, SGA strives to meet
the demand for multicultural events. Ree
garding films, selections are based purely
on the merits ofthe movies themselves; di~
rectors' and producers’gendet and ethnicity
are, generally, not a part of our discussion.
We certainly do not attempt to_discriminate
against any particular group, though it may
be beneficial to bloaden our discussions and
diversify our selections.

For this to happen, we need more come
mittee members and/or more input from
students at large. That being said, over half
ofthe films on this semester’s schedule did
come from nonrcommlttee suggestions,
and we are always open to hearing new
ideas. Unfortunately, diverse input cannot
be our only measure of success. In the past,

at many of the less wellrknown films. Since
the rights for these are often as expensive as
those of the more popular films, we neces-
sarily must consider what sort of bang we
get for our buck. Of course, if suggestions
are made that show potential for drawing
decent audiences, we will try to add them
to our lineup, but we still need to find ways
to boost attendances. If it is not possible
to do this, the more unsung films will be
left to the numerous alternate film groups
(Cultural Films Committee, Zombie Mow
ic Club, French Cinema Club, etc).

Anyone canjoin the Committee, which
meets biweekly on Monday nights. The
next meeting is this coming Monday (Nov.
9) at 9 p.m. in the SGA ofﬁces (JRC 222).
Everyone is also welcome and encour-
aged to leave comments or vote for future
screenings on our website: Ct‘ilitie/IFi/mr

the various seed companies othat. supply

farmers. Most recently genetically modir
fied seeds, patented by corporations and "leased" to farms
ers who can be prosecuted for saving seeds or allowing the
company crop to pollinate the wrong ﬁeld, have become
ubiquitous. These are family farms, usually, but they are not
the family farms ofa hundred years ago. Seeds are only one
part of what is different. In my next column I will describe
another side of industrial agriculture—synthetic pesticides,
herbicides and fertilizer.

when such independent and foreign films
constituted a much larger segment of our
schedule, Films was faced with overwhelm-
ing popular demand for more conventional
“Hollywood blockbuster" works. If atten-
dances are any indication of preferences, it
appears that this predilection remains a part
of our campus culture.

We are seeing relatively low attendance

We call them
“Ieltnlors.”
