Grinnell should add a vocational element to its theoretical curriculum

American University professor Lesley Gill Ltav»
cited to Colombia and conducted a series of inter
views in 2004 with union members and employees of
Coca-Cola. Her report concludes that “the Coca—Cola
Company fails to protect workers from paramilitary
intimidation, and, in some cases, eyewitness accounts
and abundant circumstantial evidence suggest that it
is complicit with paramilitary terror It is very clear
that there is a systematic campaign to destroy SINr
ALTRAINAL’s (the union representing the bottling
company employees) ability to defend the labor rights
of its constituents" (Labor and Human Right: ‘TIre Real
Tbing’in Colombia, pg 4-5).

Interviews conducted by independent researchers
such as Gill tell a much different story than Coke’s
advertisement. Until Coke is willing to accept a truly
independent investigation that addresses that inconsiSr
teney, its claims of protecting its workers will continue
to sound hollow.

Jeremy Blasi from the Center for Labor Research

documented instances in which CocarCola and its

declined to take even the most minimal precautions to
protect workers" (CutﬂrCu/R and Human Rigim in Co-

It is difﬁcult to see how Coke can call its attempts
to hide behind and block the process ofuniversity and
nonsgovcrnmcnt organization coalitions “constnictivc
engagement." Potter, the author of the advertisement
in the S553 and director of Global Labor Relations,
agreed to develop a “working group to further discuss
the feasibility of a thitdrparty assessment [in Februr
ary 2005]." A University Commissionicomposed of
student representatives from American and Canadian
universities as well as school administrators and labor
leaders from several nonrproﬁt orynizationwwas
formed. The University Commission met three times
during the summer and fall to write a protocol for an
independent assessment. But, on Oct. 26, five of the
six student members of the commission resigned in
protest, alleging that the company was “blocking the
commission's progress,’while using it to ‘pollsh its pub»
lic image'" (Woyke, Elizabeth, Businesswcek Online).

The student resignations along with the number of
years students have been working to get Coke’s cooper-
ation (about three) represent two symptoms of Coke’s
halfrhearrod cooperation in formating an independent
investigation into its global labor practices.

Coke’s advertisements in the Sid}? and college
publications around the country demonstrate the imr
pact ofstudent mobilizationThe student campaign to
boycott Coca—Cola encourages you to continue to use
your consumer power and reduce your consumption of
Coke products until the company can put some means
ingful action behind its words.

Three Rs remain relevant

Thank you to Kristen Heoft, author of Busting
Grinnell’s myth of recycling" (stag 3/10), for provid-
ing an opportunity to discuss the relevancy of recycling
programs.

Recycling has a multitude of environmental, eco-
nomic and social beneﬁts. Primarily, it prevents waste
from going to the landfill, presenting a public hazard.
Old landﬁlls leak and new landfills eventually will,
even with modern leachate collection systems and lin-
ers. That oft-carcinogenic leachatc, which contains
everything from mercury to load to polyvinyl chloride,
then runs into groundwater supplies where it can have
public health effects ranging from allergic reactions to
nerve damage to cancer.

In addition,rccyclingsaves energy. With few exceps
tions, it is more eﬂieicnt to terprocess materials than it
is to process virgin products. Less energy means fewer
greenhouse gases are emitted. Recycling also conserves
natural resources. It makes no environmental or eco-
nomic sense to throw something away just because we
can and because there may be more resources waiting
to be used.

Economically speaking, recycling can acrually not
money for households, institutions and governmental
entities. While an additional truck may be necessary
to collect recycling, the demand on the garbage truck
is then reduced, Landfill tipping fees are another way
recycling saves money. The College pays :50 per ton

to dispose otwaste, we pay nothing to recycle at the
community recycling center. Through the RecycleMar
nia contest the College has thus far diverted 20 tons
of trash by recycling, resulting in saving of a thousand
dollars.

Another economic perk of recycling is job creation.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency,
“[r]ecycling protects and expands us. manufacturing
jobs and increases U.s. competitiveness." specifically,
the lovn Department of Natural Resources states "10,
was recycling industry generates 32.4 billion in annual
industrial output and supports more than 11,400 jobs."
Is recycling still too expensavc?

Ifyou think so, consider that huge centmlized lands
fills immediately beg the question of socialjustice. Ac
cording to the EPA, “Low income, and quite often cul-
turally diverse populations, are more likely than other
groups to live near landfills, incinerators and hazardous
waste treatment facilities.” Recycling, reuse and waste
reduction can help alleviate this problem by reducing
the need for new landfills.

It is likely that technology and processes will im—
prove to make recycling even more efficient; in the
meantime, ending all recycling programs would cer
tainly cause more problems than it may allegedly
solve.

Friday, March 10, was latest install-
ment of Democratic and Republican
eltorts to jockey for position heading
into the 2006 midtcmi eloctions. On a
disappoiniing day for American poli-
cies, Congressional lawniakeis defeated
die bid of DP World, an Arab ports
company stationed in Dubai, to acquire
the American opemtions of the British-
based Paco Steam Navigation Co. The
White House was the deals most outs
spoken advocate, providing Democrats
and Republicans the perfect opportu-
tiity to capitalize on the rapidly sliding
popularity of a stumbling presidency.

With these objectives in mind,
Washington challenged not only the bid
of DP World, but also the Arab com—
munity including operations in major
American cities, the deal, lawmakers
contended, repre-

to American securi

ty. Claiming that the
United Arab Emir-
ates had harbored
Osama Bin Laden
nearly seven years ago and that three
ofthe 19 9/11 hijackers had been UAE
nationals, many American congrcssmcn
were horriﬁed by the prospect of Arab
ownership of strategic U.S.assetsr

On March 9, growing American
pressure and hosn'lity forced DP World
to relinquish its claim to the American
ports. Washington quickly hailed the
news as a victory for America’s secu»
rity and future autonomy. This victory,
however, is hardly gratifying. Lawmak—
ers in both parties failed to realize how
their rhetoric might be perceived by are
millions of Arab and Muslim individu-
als living in the world. Indeed, the line
between protecting our nation’s secu-i
rity and unjustly persecuting groups of
people is a ﬁne one, and Congress has
overstepped it in Dubai’s case.

First, since September 11, the Unit-
ed Arab Emirates has become a strong
ally of the United States, allowing U.S.
forces access to its ports and harbors
Yet, Washington has continued to dis—
irustthc nation, citing its antirAmcrican
past. But what hypocrisy! For although
15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from
Saudi Arabia, we allow the Saudi royal
family to invest over 3500 billion in
the U.S. economy. Though Saudi Arab
has an even more radical past than the
UAE, American dependence on Saudi
oil has not diminished. can we honestly
purport that the UAE is too dangerous
to do business while simultaneously de—
veloping unbreakable links with Saudi
capital?

Secondly, DP World is a completely
reputable company, having been apt
plauded by lndia, Israel and Europe
in the past. But most importantly, at
many of the ports, DP World would

not have been the sole owner ofservicr
ing rights. For example, in Newark, the
UAE would only have been a 50 percent
shareholder, with the other half of the
port being under Danish control. Given
that Denmark had recently published
oEensive cartoons depicting the prophet
Muhammad, America's favoritism ofthe
Danes served to undeiscorc American
prejudice.

Furthermore, if the deal had gone
through, the Coast Guard, not the Arab
company, would have connolled port
security Indeed, foreign ownership of
ports is rather commonplace, and ifsuch
deals forced nations to relinquish control
over their security, then these contracts
would never materialize. By assimilating
information to its preexisting beliefs re-
garding the relationship between Islam
and terrorism,Wasli-
ington failed to real
lac that Dubai would
not have controlled
the selection of the
ports‘ workforce ei-
that.

For its part, the Arab media has por~
trayed U.S. opposition to the ports deal
as contrasting remarkably with Ameri-
can acceptance of European and Asian
investment, and has noted America's
acceptance of Arab stereotypes since
9/11. According to the Wor/oingion Port,
American distrust of Muslims has his
creased. “The problem is," an oﬂicial in
Dubai noted, “for four of ﬁve years, we
haven’t found a way to repair that dams
aged image."

But denying the UAE rights to ser—
vice U.S. ports is a major insult to the
Muslim world. That Congress would
slander a respected Arab company only
illustrates America’s intense xenophobia
and failure to hold itself to the values of
freedom andequalityitsoardcntlywraps
itself in. After their “victory" many law—
makers hoped that this chapterin Arab-
American relations had ﬁnally ended.
However, racial and religious prejudice
caimot simply be bnished under the rug
and ignored. That our rcpresentao‘ves
would covertly incite racial discrimi-
nation is not something to champion.
Lawmakers' tactics only confused the
public mind, distorting facts and giving
credence to gossip, hearsay and fallacy.

Although Washington claims it
had our interests at heart, American xer
nophobia will only increase the divide
between our nation and Muslims in
the future. Already involved in Iraq and
Afghanistan, this is a dangerous pros
pect indeed. American hostility could, in
are long run, be much more damaging
to our security than Arab control of US.
ports. True to fortn, Washington failed
to realize the potential outcomes of its
actions, uniting instead in a new wave of
American cthnocenuism.
