Playing for the unseen: “Alfred”

Hannah Sayle '08, winner of a campus playwriting competition, explores disability and character in her work

Hannah sayie 'os reoentiy witnessed a staging ofher play “Ale
ﬂed" as part ofher ﬁrst-place award in the annual campuSewide
MeCienon Clark Piaywriting Contest.

W/mz isymlrplrzy [lbw]?

It is about a character, Alfred, who is dent and blind. You never
see Alfred on stage. It is essentially about how av?
eryone around him reacts to him, and what their
responses are.

Wm yen tiers/om a/ all about pmmymg a dire
ale/rd (II/mm”?

Yeah,I was actually kind of worried about that.

I thought that some of the focus would be tiitned
away trom his disability by virtue of the fact that
he never shows up on stage, he's never an object of
ridicule His presence brings out the character of
the other people around him, '

What ilra’Pir’tdyulL to arm: rim?

It was an assignment, but I guess I just wanted to play with the
idea of having a character that you don‘t see, so that you can just
bring out the personalities of the characters around him, to see how
people react to certain situations.

Didyau know 547w it would and Ill/M71 you started?

Certainly not ...I had this idea to ﬁnd someone who would make
enough of an impact on people that he could be offstage.

How dizlyauﬁ'e/abaut the reading? What woreyenftr/ing term 21::
lig/Jlr went up?

I felt pretty nervous about how people would receive it the
question came up as to whether or not I wanted it to be played
straight or over the top and I wasn’t sure, those were things I hadn’t

thought that much about when I was writing it OutiTht’ir was acmr
ally one of the hardest parts with talking to Tom [Oosting, director]
was that he asked me a bunch of questions that I didn’t really have
answers to It seemed a little ridiculous because I did write the play,
but I didn’t have it all worked out in my head about staging and
stuff,

I do have control issues, and I do like to have some
control and that’s something I enjoyed doing in this pro—
duction, since Torn asked me my opinion on things
but not having Control is just an aspect or playwriting
that you just have to suck it up ifyou want to do piaywne
ing With a play, its a little more obvious that people
are m interpreting your work because you’re in the the-
ater with them but that's something that happens with any form
ofwriting, that’s something you have to garnhie with. That’s kind of
a risk with expression in generni,1 think.

If you’re asking whether I have a black beret and purple velveV
teen coat, no. I’m a little too modest for that, I think, I don’t really
consider myselfa playwright.I tried my hand at playwriting, I took
a class on playwriting, but it's a little too ambitious to call myself a .a
playwright.
