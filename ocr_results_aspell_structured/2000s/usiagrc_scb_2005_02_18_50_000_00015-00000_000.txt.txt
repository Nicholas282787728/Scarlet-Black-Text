Track to Iowa Open,

last meet pre-MWCs

Teams return to action after Monmouth; individuals prep for Conference

BY KEVIN BVRNE

For some runners, Saturday's Iowa
Open in Iowa City represents their first
action this winter. For others, it repre-
sents the last run before Conference.

”Friday will be the first meet of the
season for several of the runners. and
they are simply looking to run hard and
to have some ﬁlll,"said Dave Kjlst ‘08.

Head coaches Will and Evelyn
Freeman, however,
will balance this
against the pains-
taking preparation
required to put a
successful ﬁnish to
the indoor season,
which closes with
Conference in early
March.

“For the Iowa meet," said women‘s
coach Evelyn Freeman, “it's our last
competition heading in ro Conference.
Instead of focusing on relays, we‘ll be
focusing on perlonnanees in individual
events. We need seed times for these
events for Conference and some rune
ners are again running a different event
so that we can again determine which

athlete should run which event at Con-
fetcllcc. The goal oronv field event ath-
letes isjust to keep progressing."

Both the men’s and women’s teams
will head to Iowa City looking to imr
prove nnmhers and times from her
week, when they attended the Mone
mouth Invitational in Monmouth, Illir
nois.The men ﬁnished seventh overall
and the women finished ninth, with
some good individ-
ual performances on
each side. Krist postr
ed a time ol‘15:36.43
in the 5,000, a time
good for second
place, while tcarne
mate Nick Fogg loo
took third place in
15:56.53. Colin TSr
chida ‘05 finished third in the mile with
a time (£432.58.

on the women's side, sarah spen-
cer ‘08 ran to a first-place ﬁnish in
the 5.000 with a time 18:53.39, while
teammate Alison Louthan ‘08 ﬁnished
in sixth place with a time of19z4659.

“I haven't ever run a 5000 on a track
before so I am still learning how to race

it,"said Spencer. "I don't know what my
best time would be, but I know Satur—
day‘s rltce isn’t it try any means. I didn't
necessarily expect to win or not win be
cause as a firsr year I don't really know
rhc competition at all, so to be honest
I never know what to expect. Ijust go
out thele and run my race howl like to
run it, regardless ofwhat everyone else
seems to be doing."

The competition at Monmouth and
the upcoming meet in Iowa City will
be good indicators for what each team's
strengths and weaknesses are. With
Conference only two weeks away, the
athletes and coaches know that time
and meet performances are large face
tors in determining how the confer
encc meet will unfold.

“We are using thesc early indoor
meets as a chance to gct in some quale
ity running workouts on some good
tracks," said Freeman, “since we’le \ln’
able to do this at our own home facil-
ity. wc are also having our athletes run
a variety or cvcnrs from week to week,
not only for the training effect, but to
gathei information as to which events
they are best suited.”

Down 32-20 in Saturday's game against Illinois College, the Pie-

neer WOMEN’S BASKETBALL team reeled off an 18-0 run in the final
Stages of the ﬁrst half and went into the locker mom with a 38-32
lead However, the Pioneers were unable to hold the lead, and lost
87-78 to the Lady Blues in overtime. Illinois College was once the
nemesis of MEN’S BASKETBALL, famously dismissing the Pioneers
from the postseason in the MWC Final at Darby Gym in 2003. These
days, the Blue-boys are Grinnell’s favorite opponent. Half of Grinnell's
conference wins have came at IC’s expense, including the only Pier
neer road victory in the MWC this season and a 114-108 win in Darby
on Saturday. WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING’S seventh straight
Conference title extended its own Midwest Conference record for cone

.secutive MWC crowns. Grinnell also has the secondrlungest streak,
winning the ﬁrst five from 1979-1983. In fact, Grinnell or Lake For-
est has won every year except for 1985 and 1986, when Cue (then an
MWC member) took back~to»bacl< titles. MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIV- L
ING, winners of the last four nwc titles, has a comparatively long
way to go to match its own standards of excellence The Pioneers
once won eight Conference titles in a row (1979—1986) and 15 of 17 ,
through 1995. No other team has had a streak of four or more since
Carleton won ﬁve straight during the Great Depression, dominance
that was ﬁnally halted by Belnitin 1941, Lawrence in 1942, and then ,
World War II. ‘ ——Jde Gerri

item.

The last team to beat Grinnell MEN'S BASKETBALL in a regu-r.
lar season game in the old Darby Gym comes to town Saturday
in the season finale to face a Pioneer team that has gone 3,4
at home this season in is new gym. Lake Forest snagged a 140?
135 GT win in Dec. 2001 at old Darby and Grinnell responded by
never losing another regular season game there, a streak that
included three wins over the Foresters. Lake Forest, with a 105
nwc record, has already clinched a playoff berth. Tipoffi53 p.m.
The WOMEN’S BASKETBALL team also plays Lake Forest in
Darby, with a 1 pm. tip. The visitors will have little to play for,
having clinched a playoff berth Wednesday night with a 65-42
dismantling of the fifth-seed Illinois College team that edged
Grinnell in OT last weekend. ~ '—Joe GEni _,
