In CHLOE MORYL

As college students, we ve all been subjected to strep throat,
a cold or just a rally bad hangover Vthre can you no to get
a doctors appointment, act the magic mystery bag of drugs
or just a get-our-or class cntd? The Health ccntcr, of course.
However, the blg‘VL'SK smile and helping hand in the Health
center will be tr§patting at the end of tho school year, as Jean
King is retiring from Grinncll College.

Jean has worked at the Grinnell College Health Center
for the past nine years, while concurrently workrng with the
Grinnell Regional Hospital until ii few months ago, “I wasn't
scared ol' apprehensive,” said Jean about starting to work at the
college. “I looked at it as a new adventure."

For Jean, spendrng rrrrrc wrth her coworkers and students
has played a central role In her job at Grinucll, “Part of the
whole job goes with rvho you take care of," said Jean. “1 don’t
think there’s a single student here that I don't get along with."

However, before she started working for the health center,
jcan had an idea otwhat
dcaling with students
would be like.“I thought
going into it that maybe
they're smarter than me,
or I'm not smart enough
to give them medical
adrrce or any advice
at all," said Jean. “But
when 1 got hero, it just —
didn‘t seem that way. Students are people too and you're just
looking for help.”

At times, the help that students request hits taken strange
forms. “About eight ycars ago, the day bctorc Thanksgiving, a
few students came into the health center carrying a container,"
said Jean. “And when they opened rt up, it was full ofhead licc
crawling all over.”

As it was the day before Thanksgiving, hundreds otstudcnts
swarmed the health center, wanting to get their heads checked
before getting on airplanes or traveling home rn long car rides,
“it got to bc comic-a1 by the end,"laughcd Jcan.

While she has only spent the past nine years helping
Grinnell studentsJean has been in the town ofGrinnell for the
past twenty and working as a nurse {or the past thirty years.

“We have seen Grinnell change in twenty ycars,"snld]ct1n.
“There are so many parts that are memorable, and most of all,
I think that Grinneil is just such a wonderful place to raise
children and raise a family."

”A few studenti tame into the
hea/th (enter carrying a ton-
tdrnet when they opened it, it
was full afhead lite.”

Jean King

However, jeans time in Grinnell will soon come to an end,
as she and her husband wrll move to Missouri. “We bought a
plot orland two years ago and built a house,” said Jcan,

Jean has two sons, Brian and Brandon. Brian currently re-
sides and works in Des Moines, and Brandon has graduated
from Co: College and rs considering moving out to Missouri,
ncar Jean and her husband.

The change otlocation, with a house located on a beautrrul

him to stay on as a consultantior he’ll just fish all the time,"
Jean said ofhcr husband. “But it'll be nice for him to not have
to go by the clock anymore."

In thinking back on her time before leaving, Jean reﬂected
fondly on the school's snrdcnts. “The main tlrirrgl say to kids is:
you’re my future, I've taken care of you, and I know you’ll take
care ofme,”said Jean, “You're all kept me young and in leaving
with no sadness,"

In 1910 one year after Grinncll college orncrally ncquilcd
its name. L B Watt ﬁrst entered the town Barely able to sup
port himself on a small scholarship, Watt shoveled sidewalks
and worked at the two local weekly newspa-
pers. After the two papers merged to form
the Grimm/l Hem/d— Register in 1940,VV.1H
rcnrrned and bought the paper. Almost

Gvinnd/Hzr'a/d- -REgi.tIcr still remains a Watt
ramily’papet and a place where college and
community meet.

The family, which now goes by Pindcr,
continues to oversee all aspects of the paper,
from writing to editing Dorothy Finder, Watt's daughter, is a
current editor and columnist for the Horn/drRegirter. Two of
Dorothy's daughters, Mary '80 and Martha ’84, both Grinnell
alums, serve as managing editors.And in addition to Mary and
Martha, the newspaper has long had a relationship with the
5558.

“For years [the SEER] was published in our composing
room," said Dorothy,

Some students have continued to work for the paper, like
Christine Stoddard ’11.“My favorite story was writing about
the two consignment stores in rown,"Stoddard said. “i was re-
ally involved in journalism work in high school in Washing
ton D.C,, and I wanted to continue that rcalrworld experience
here.”

In addition to occasionally hiring students, the Hem/d-
Rt’giildr offers trial subscriptions to all new Grinnell College

professors. “'lvc subscribed to it probably since I fllst came here
30 years ago, said Sigmund Barber, German. Its good to keep
up with the news in town .school board meetings and suclI.'

But the papcr's rot-us r-crnarns on the town and the larger
Grinncll community. The Hdr'n/ri—Regii/er'
does employ reporters rndcpcrrdcntly for some
stories about the college, but “to a certain eta
rent, the collcgc controls what wc hear about
the college through the public relations dc—
partment,” said Dorothy. “Unless there's some
really outrageous, a real outbreak it might not
have been called to our attention

Most of their reporters, like Stoddard, are
focused on gaining realrlifc, professronal expo
rrcnce in how a community works They want to cover the
town, and thcrcs plenty going on there, so they
dont need to run that much about the College,"
said Stoddard

The Herald-Raglan) ﬁrst and foremost at-
tempts to keep people informed about the most
Important events of the town in a format that
is easy to read and widely available. “There are
certain beats that nccd to bc covcrcd rcgarlarly:
the city news, and the school district, and cer—
tain things like that we try to cover With our rer
porters." said Dorothy, “We do send copies ottlrc paper to the
collcgc library, and some orthe burldings receive copies of the
Hem/dergiiltr' also. They’re available if students are interested
in tcading them."

”They want to [over the town,

and there’s p/enty 90mg on

there, in they don’tneed to run

that muth about the (oi/ens.”
Christine Stoddard ’il

inunicat‘ions at the college, sees a strong need for such a paper,
“I can tell you a community newspaper rs extremely valuable,"
suid VVorster, “1 think this is a good comrnunity ncwspapcri
think it does exactly what it needs to do for the community.”

But with two Grinneil college alums as managing editors,
the newspaper has underlying links to the college and outer
world Like their grrrndtarhcr, Mary and Martha came back to
the Her/llaﬁRegii/m' after spending time working in the outside
world. After college, Mary worked as an rrnprovisational ate
tress in the Midwest and Martha left from a sireyear stint as a
journalist in the former Czechoslovakia. Another Pindcr sister
and Grinnell alumnus, Jeanne Pinder '75, now works as a copy
editor for the New York Tmm,

While some students may not understand the appeal in to»
turning to Grinnell after graduation, their mother noted the
family draw. “I am sure that growing up
in a newspaper family had some inﬂw
cncc you don't really gct away from it,”
said Dorothy. “People like to call you up
and tell you things that should print, So]
am sure that their experiences at the colr
lcgc and in thc tanrrly would have opened
those kinds ofdoots for them.”

Whatever the reason they have tee
malned in Grinnell, the Finder family
has aircctcd the Grinnell community for
almost 100 years through their work at the Hem/d—REgrrler:
"They’re an amazing family. and i think sometimes people
don‘t talk about all otthc amazing things that thcy have done,”
Worster said.
