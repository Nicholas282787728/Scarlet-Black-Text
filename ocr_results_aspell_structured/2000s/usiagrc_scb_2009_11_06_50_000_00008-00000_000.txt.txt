Accessibility 0f SGA; professor brings films to campus

Professor’s extracurricular activity on campus

If it seems like the SGB’s‘Arts section is turning into the
icons ﬁlm section, you're wrong, but it is not just your imagi—
nationThis increased focus on the role of films in campus life
is not necessarily a result of a general lack of alternative artis—
tic events, or a passionate interest in films on the part of the
section editor, but largely because of the committed work ofa
professor and several of her students.

While we would never say that films events are anything
less than the product of intense collaboradonﬁee this weeks
article on the integration of silent films with compositions by
campus music groups on p. s—Terri Seller’s, Associate Profes-
sor of English, commitment to developing a film culture on
campus is extraordinary and should be commended,

In addition to her notoriously rigorous yet undeniably env
gaging Films Analysis course, Gellers work with the Cultural
Films Committee has brought in challenging and intelligently
beautiful ﬁlms such as “Brazil" on 35 millimeter ﬁlm and the
North American premier of‘The Code._"Her roles in a number
of ﬁlm festimls and events such as Better Know a Professor
have served not just to develop annell as a center for film, but

also to soften 'rhe divide between what it means to be a student,

staff, community or faculty member and what it means to be

intellectually engaged with the cultural life around you.
Gellei’s dedication to the broader

Grinnell community extends beyond 77

supporting an extracurricular program

which many professors do commends

ably. Here is a commitment to develop» i

ing a culture arpund these programs b

encouraging awareness of collaborative

and discussion based events, Geller has '

shown that any professor h'a's the oppor-

tunity to profoundly inﬂuence the'nature' and personality of

this institution, far beyond the conﬁnes of the classroom.

SGA is reaching out to the college community

Institutional transparency matters to the Grim-tell commu—
nity Time and time again, students ﬁnd themselves wondering
not only how institutional decisions are made, but WHO the
hell is making them. ma ..c..

We would like to give a hats-off to this year’s Student GoVe
emment Association (SGA) cabinet for being available, open

and for their evereincreasing eFforts for transparency. In years
past, SGA has maintained an active roie on campus, but not one
nearly so open and encouraging to input.

We’ve seen improvements in these
matters this year in the form of the
proposed reforms to the College Hear»
ing Board and the Judicial council,
which support SGA’s attempt to have
public records documented for student

» knowledge. SGA has worked in coop-
eration with the SRC and Student Afe
' , . ' fairs on the Bias-Motivated incident
Response Pplicy. Students have been well informed of the steps
in any policy, in the form ofthe cabinet's frequent all-campus
e—mails, and willingness to speak to the 5&8 on any and eve
issue. , -
Even at the micro level, SGA mikes themselves available
for the campus at large, Any student that wants to meet with a
cabinet member for any reason has time to do so, as SGA has
made their cabinet‘s ofﬁce hours readily available to students,
notably in the form of a whiteboard visibly located in the JRC.
Good job SGA. You’ve done the right thing.

Upcoming symposium reaches realm of tickledOm

A group'of Grinnell College students make daring and ticklish decision to compete with local ”major league” bowlers

A ticklish Fall Break has come and gone,
and the Grinnell Tickle City Award is once
again hunting all around Grinnell to uncover
things deserving othe coveted award.

‘Our first ticklish topic of the week takes us
to 915 State St., about a block south of cam-
pus, The setting is the Grinnell Bowladromr,
a place many students
have frequented in
past years as pm of the
Grinnell Bowling Club
or the Bowling Physi— TICKLE
cal Education Class
and rolled a few casual games with friends.
This year, however, a group of ﬁve students
decided they wanted to experience the ticklish
underbelly that is the Grinnell competitive
howling scene and have entered the “King Pin”
league, comprised entirely of older, veteran
bowlers drawn trom the Grinnell community,

Mart Rosenbaum ’12 came up with the
idea, and when the students showed up for the

first week, they had not yet picked a team name,
ﬁguring they would be able to do so when they
arrived When they got there, however, they saw
on the league sheer that a name had already
been chosen for (hen-liwl‘he Kids." The team
experienced some early success, but some of
the league’s better squads, who have been play-
ing together for over
20 years, have proven
tough competition.
As a result “The Kids"
CITY have been spotted ei»
ther ponting or crying
for their parents on a number orcccasions. Sear
son highlights to this point include Rosenbauin
rolling a slew of 200 games and a couple mem-
bers of the team hitting puberty, prompting the
team to consider a name change.

Moving forvmrd, on Nov. 1042 Grinnell
College will host a symposium callcd “Rights
and the Environment," As the ofﬁcial news

release reports, the symposium will “explore
the delicate relationship between the rights
of the environment, humans and animals
from the vantage points of
democracy, justice and cons
servation." It aims to an-
swer questions like whether
it’s a human right to Cons
troi the environment, how
animal rights atrecr impact
conservation and whether
biological diversity and hu
man activity can coexist.
The symposium is expected
to wrap this all up neatly in
three days

Speakers include geography, philosophy
and history professors, the director of the
Wildlife Conservation Society Institute,
and the director of Responsible Policies
for Animals Inc. The Rosenfield Program,

however, recognizes that an all-human cast

they are bringing in some diverse speakers. A
panel of Grinnell Fox Squirrels, for one, will
discuss abuses they have sat-
fered at the hands of col-
lege students, from physical
harm down to the level of
being fed disgusting things
like plain sugar cookies from
Outtakes.

In addition, the Rosen-
ﬁeld Program has been in
talks with a Tanzanian e1»
ephant about traveling to
Grinnell to give a talk den
tending his right to practice
crop raiding. As the elephant explains, “Crops
are so delicious." If the elephant is able to are
tend, his talk will undoubtedly add a viral layer
to the symposium.
