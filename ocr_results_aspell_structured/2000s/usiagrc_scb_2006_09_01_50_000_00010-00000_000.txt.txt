To say the least, i was impressed
byjuhn Bohman’s tireless woik for the
student body last year. His efforts led
to many accomplishments, and I won’t
take for granted the fact that his efforts
also led to whatl believe is an increased
confidence and elevated expectation of
our student government. Individuals

pecinlly those individuals who possess a
genuine interest in each other.

That’s what Grinncll is about,

the opportunity to create new campus

resurrect our old favorites. Maybe I'll go

New year, new Scarlet & Black

There are many roles a newspaper can play: watch-
dog, gadﬂy, the Fourth Estate. Here at the 5551?,we’ve
discussed all these and more and have decided to for
cus on three ways to serve the community We will
work our best to entertain, inform and involve.

Entertain

We plan on revamping the paper in several ways.
one of the most visible changes will take place on
the front page. Previously, the front page consisted of
solely "News" articles.This year we plan on publishing
our more compelling, complex stories above the fold,
be they News, Features,Arts or Sports. This will allow
us to highlight important stories that are not neces—
sarily time sensitive. We also plan on experimenting
more with different aspects of design in our contin-
ued effort to produce a newspaper that is both intel-
lectually and visually appealing.

We've also decided to abandon our commitment
to printing fact. That is, we have formed a relation-
ship with the Gimme” Review, in which we will pubs
lish weekly original fiction and poetry in the Arts
section. We want to give Grinnellians another outlet
to showcase their creativity while adding an exciting
new feature to the St‘s’B. We encourage everyone to
start sending submissions.

The news will also be appearing rﬂthe pages of
your favorite oldest college newspaper west of the
Mississippi. That’s right sports fans, the SEER will
soon begin publishing a regular weblog, or biog. Too
often news breaks on a Friday or Saturday, and we
have to wait a whole week before we can report those
stories. sometimes we're scooped by [Plans]; other

times false rumors run wild, when a quick phone call
to Tom Crady could have the situation cleared up in
no time. Our blog will be a way to report on stories as
they develop as well as focus on issues that may not
have room in the print editionThe blog will also he a
great way to ﬁlrther open the lines of communication
between us and our readers, allowing you to comment
on stories and offer feed
back.

Inform

over the past few years,
SEE editors have focused
on making the newspaper
more professional and as
accurate as possible, and
the newspaper has indeed
improved. We are hardly
perfect in our reporting,
but hey, even the New Yort Times prints a correction
box. We remain committed to accurate and ethical
journalism but this year we intend to improve reads
ability and take more risks. This means that we‘re go,
ing to experiment with longer investigative pieces and
narrative journalism. Narrative journalism, according
to Mark Kramer, director of Hamrd’s Nieman Pro-
gram on Narrative Journalism, “doesn’t assume the
reader is a robot acknowledges the reader knows
lots and feels and snickers and gets wild." And we
know you get wild.

Involve

One of the things we’re most excited about is in-
tegrating the 388 more into the campus community.

Like you,we are Grinnellians, not faceless newspapers
putterrouters who drop the SHE off in the post ofﬁce
every Friday and then scurry away. This is your neWSr
paper as much as it is ours.We don’t want to remain
separate and isolated on the second floor of the new
Campus Center (come visi .We want ro hear from
you: your opinions, your ideas and what you’re dos
ing on and off campus, as
individuals and as groups.
Think we should write
about something? Tell us
(through a suggestion box
in the post office or an
email at [newspapr]).

We want to be a fo-
rum for dialogue on cam-
pus. We know you are an
opinionated bunch and the

scan is an ideal space to voice those opinions and err
gage in debate. Letters to the editor, random rants,
and guest columns are great ways for students, faculty,
staff, and town residents to have productive discourse
outside the classroom.

This year we have a great team of new editors and
writers with lots of energy and lots of ideas. We’re re—
ally excited and we look forward to a great year with
your help.
