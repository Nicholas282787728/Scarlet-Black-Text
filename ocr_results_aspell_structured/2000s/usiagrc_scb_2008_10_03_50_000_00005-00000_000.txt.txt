Ashton and Demi shoot the stump for Obama

While Kutcher s

Grinnellians are often proud of their own
local celebrities like Lyle and Russ, but sl’U*
dents recently had a chance to interact with
the truly famous when husband and wife star
duo Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore visited
Grinnell college. The two Hollywood stars
stopped by JRC 101 last Saturday afternoon to
rally students to the cause ofpresidential can-
didate Barack Obama,

tacle of celebrity. Neither of the two made
particularly insightful political commentary,
and they often relied mainly on their public
speaking abilities. “it's not about this being a
red state, or a blue state.1t's about being a red,
white and blue state behind Barack Obama,"
Kutcher said at one point.

The two struck extremely different stance
es with their onstage personas: Kutcher was
an impassioned and effective speaker while
Moore admitted to being nervous talking to
the crowd,

Kutcher's namral speaking abilities were
evident as he spoke with vigor and humor
throughout, and his ability to relate political
points to stories about his family gave his pet
lirical points greater relevancy. While he may
not have offered any new political insight into
healthcarc, relating his sisters struggles as a
single mother made his points more concrete.

Moore, on the other hand, lacked Kutehs
er’s personal touch in her arguments, offering
little beyond tried and true generalities At one
point it appeared that even Kutchet noticed
the lack ofawareness in Moore’s speech.When
she argued that goods produced abroad were
no longer affordable, Kutcher pointed out the

“We can afford it, you can’t afford it," Kutchsr
told the college—loans—burdened crowd.

In an interview after the speech, Moore’s
limited political knowledge was apparent
when asked what single Obama polity issue
most compelled her. “For me it would be very
difﬁcult to sum it up in one issue, because I
really think it’s about his approach to all the

issues," she said,

But Kutcher was able to answer the dues
tion more specifically, detailing aspects of our
policy in the Middle East and relations with
saudi Arabia, making it less ofa surprise when
he said that he may someday potentially seek
political office.

But while Kutcher may have flexed some
policy muscle, the general feel ofthe event was

The campus Republicans, on the other hand, had little if
any campaigning efforts while some segments ofthe group en—
couraged students to wit and vote on the official Election Day
on Nov 4. “We actually encouraged people to wait, because we
feel that we haven’t had a lot of exposure to the candidates or to
their issues," said Valerie Stimac '09, coileader of the Campus
Republicans, “So we wanted people to be a little bit more in-
formed when they came out [to vote]."

students on campus expressed mixed sentiments toward

they saw as an overly aggressive effort to reach
students. "It’s not like we didn't hear them the
first time that they came over, just like second
and third time, and then all around campus
[on Wednesday],” said Adam Thein ’10, “It's
overbearing."

But others recognized the registration ef-
forts as a necessary, if unpleasant, component
of campaign politics. “I understand why they
were doing it and it makes sense on a political level," said Van

leniency with respecting other people's political opinions would
have been nice,"

Students who have already voted can expect to see a lower
presence from the Campus Democrats in the next few weeks.
“It’s going to be more targeted, we’re
going to be talking more speciﬁcally to
students that didn't get to turn out on
October 1," Schicrenbeck said. “We’re
going to do our best to let those who
have already voted be."

For people who missed satellite vote
mg this past Wednesday bur would still
like to vote on campus, they will have
another opportunity to vote early at the
Forum on Oct 13. Registering to vote in
town will remains open until Oct 25. after which students can
only register on election day and they will have to provide proof
ofresidency and identification.
