More craziness at Joint Board

The circus that has become the race for SGA president took on another carnival-
like element at Wednesday night's joint board meeting, when Mat Man ‘03 moved to

impeach an SEA senator for written comments the senator had made about one of the

presidential candidates.

Marr, one of senator and presidential candidate Rachel Melis’s constituents.

moved to impeach Norris Senator Jim Dinnerville '01 for an email Dinnerville had sent
to approximately ten friends and acquaintances. In the email, Dinnerville was critical

of Melis’s motives for running for president and of her campaign Style.
Marr described the email as libelous and moved that Dinnerville be impeached.

The motion was not Seconded. After a few minutes of discussion, when Marr's motion

had still not been seconded, Joint Board moved on to other matters.
