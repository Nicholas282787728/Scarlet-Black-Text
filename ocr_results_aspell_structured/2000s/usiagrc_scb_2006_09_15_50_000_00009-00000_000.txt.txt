The dream of a ridiculous man

How Rumsfeld gets his history wrong, and why we should care

His stttus 111d prestige were gone. His polished protessionnl
reputation had long ago succumbed to a characterization of incf-
fectiveness and foolishness.

Despite a terrible summer marred by encouraged Dcmoctuts and
fnithlcss Republicans calling ineessuntiy for his itnmedi1re rcsigna»
tion, Donald Rumsfeld stepped back into the politic1l spotlight on
Aug. 29 at the National,Confcrcnct: of American Legronnair-es in
5111 Lake City. The Defense secrer11y l1iinched vigorously into 1
familiar condemna’tion ofAmci-icati and
foreign “oppositionists" who doubted
the correctness of the Bush administrar
tion's toreign policy, Rumsfeld asserted
that individuals ofthis mindset tragicalr
ly “suffered from moral and intellectual
confusion" as to wh1t really threatened
America's security

Secretary Rurnsfeld’s comment was only the latest of adminis-
tr1tion ofﬁcials’ assertions that link criticism otArnericnu policy to
surrendering to our “enemies."Thcy maintain that America acts in
the interests of not only herself but also of the world, and that to
defy or criticize American policy is to prevent the world from folr
lowing its proper eourse orprordemocretic development

secretnry Rumsfeld continued his speech by comparing liherils
ofthe“blartie- Americ1- rust rrient1liry to tho1c who appeascd Hire
ler 111 the 1930s, asking rhetorically, C111 we really afford to return
to the view that An1eric1,und not the terrorists, [is] the cause ofrhe
world’s troubles?"

1 thank Secretary Rumsfeld for this lesson in
history. But history teaches us other lessons as
well, lessons which demonstrate that America’s
present course, far from being what the world
necds, is profoundly dangerous 1nd lrtcspon»
siblc.

Ont: historical lesson which Mr. Rumsfeld
seems to havc forgotten is the familiar story of
the powerful nation which egotistically attempts
to extend its political and rmlitary inﬂuence to
foreign lands Without regard to its consequences,

in the process of its conquest the empire
mercilessly replaces unfriendly letielers with submissive puppets,
harshly controls rebellious populations and disregards opposirienists
as believers offalschoods, deceptions and untrurhs.

I note this historic trend because the United Statcs is an empire,
at least to the extent that it is relatively unchallenged in today’s world.
American foreign intervention reﬂects a historical model character»
istic ofmany empires: 1 beliefin the superiority ofits governmental
system and ideology 1bove all others, 1 desire to pursue its interests
around the world nod to crush those who oppose its will, 1 conviCr

On the Verge

Setretary Rumsfeld’s comment
was only the latest of
administration oli‘itials’asseitions
that link criticism ofAmeiitan
pal/(y Witli surrendering to out

tion thnt it has the sole right to police the intern1tionnl community
1nd to determine acceptable world policy; the list is endless.

Brit sechml')’ Rumsfeld seems to believe that when the United
sr1tes spic d1 its influence it is acting out ofi humane desire to libs
cr1te populations liVlng under tyr1rinv oppression, 1nd misfortune

This is common to empires, its Greece, Rome and the so,
vict Union illustr1te Many empires historically spoitetl .1 nuisk or
friendship to hide their deception and concealed their real interests
With the rhetoric oflibcration, civiliza-
tion and salvation.

But why does scciet1iy Rumsfeld
believe thrit Americi is so gcncrous?
Even though United states policy is ru-
eled by American seltrlnterest. he seems
to believe that what beneﬁts the United
States also benefits populations every
where.

As Mr. Rumsfeld outlined, when other governments pursue
policies hostile to American interests, these “antirAmerican”policres
are also hostile to the interests ofthe international community, Since
Americ1n policy supposedly promotes freedom and dcmoct‘rlcyi
and not the interests at profiteering American corporation57tl‘ic
United States confronts thosc world leaders who it believes deny
“oppressed“ populntions the huin1n right orselr-deteirninnrion.

Yet in Rumsfeld’s view, demoemey is only in the world’s inter-
est when foreign peoples clect governments friendly to the United
States--as the election ofl—lamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Leb-
1r1on illustr1te. Pro-Americ1nisrn, not democr1-
tization, is what the Secretary and his “followers"
hope to sprend around the world.

The United st1tes pursues 1 n1ilir1nt and
hegemonic foreign policy without considering
its consequences because it believes in the myth
that American 1nd world interests rim always
comp1tiblc. Secretory Rumsrcld r1ils to realize
that every hegemonic empire cte1tes its own
gr1yediggcrs

Today's “confused intellccnlals," to use Sec-
rct1ry Rumsfeld words, are merely alerting the

stration that the United States will not be spared the fate of
mo. s that were too proud to 1d1pt, too pompous to lisrcri 1nd too
foolish to compromise. Riinisfcld's “oppositionists"hope to steer the
United States away from its present destructive course and should
not he mist1ken for unp1triotic disloyalists

I, for one, would rather listen to a dissident who articulates an
alternative course. than to Follow a stubborn and ineffective Defense
Secretary into the dustbin ofworld history.
