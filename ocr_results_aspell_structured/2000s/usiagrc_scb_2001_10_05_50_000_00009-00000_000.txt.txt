alertness ar leusr rwiee rhis year already, enrering and ending
two lounge parties at whieh alcohol was being served. SGA

have declared rhese rwe ineidenrs as a “Crisis in Stlfrgovcrr

seudenrs aren'i responsible when rhey're drunk. The crack-

To elaim rhar drinking is our “right" ar rhis seheol and
that the sehool is impinging on rhar rights as i have heard
some people do. is eemplerely unareeprable. Even wirh rhe

omeers oversrepped rheir bounds do one eonsrirure grounds

In pralse of partisanship

As congress is giving irselfa big, Seif-cangmmlutmg slap on the heels

easily things can sail rhreugh eur narional legislarnre. In rhis rirne ofna.
