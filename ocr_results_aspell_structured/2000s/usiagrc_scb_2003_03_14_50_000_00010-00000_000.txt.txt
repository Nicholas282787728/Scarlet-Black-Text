Peerless:

VI am not an anthropologist, but I
play one for the 5&8. On a Tuesday

in March, I traveled to observe Central

collegians in their native habitat about 35

miles southwest ofGrinnell. Central is a liberal
arts college in Pella, Iowa with about 1650 students
and an afﬁliation with the Reformed Church of

Amerioa. it is ripe for srudy due to its potentially very
dirrerenr culture yer intimate geographic proximity. Be-
lc-Wr I have organized my ﬁeld riots. Mysrudy is notwithe
our hulr, nor is it complete. But arrer six hours on name
pus, I was able ro conclude central is not Grinnellz it is
very diirerenr.

Central Dorm Culture

A: Central. the dorms are single sex. Bathrooms are
nevereoed. I suspect rhissegregarion is responsible for both
shocking cleanliness and bizarre bulletin boards rharsoem
designed to only srun and numb.

8:41 a.m,The firsrsoundl hearupon arriving on cam»
pus is an alarm eloekblaring from the ﬁrst ﬂoor ofa nearby
dorm. I don't mrnd the lack of an amplifying loggia.

8:55 am. Wander inro a random dorm. There are signs
for a Durch Dancing Parade on the door. in the hallway,
there is a bulletin board deeorared not with info about
condoms, aloohol poisoning or venereal diseases, but wirh
Friendship Quores. “A memory lasts forever," ir rells me,
“never does it die. True friends stay rogerlrer. and never say
goodbye." Is this a
g i r l s '

dorm? ,
8:56 a.m. I ﬁnd another bulletin board: Quotes for
Life. "Life was murh easier when we thought boys had
cooties." Damn straight. I’m mesmerized by rlrrs living
spaee, is there any evidence ofdebauchery? Yes, I come to
another bulletin board, and discover even rriendship girls
like beer: under “What kids want ro be when rhey grow
up2Llieer lnvenror, number two, Under “Dinosaurs?"—
Beerasaurus, number three, No posters rell me how ro deal
wirh depression, so maybe this is their answer. i do spy
something sobering in one Quore for Life: "somerirnes I
wish i rvas a whire erayon, rhen no one would use me,”
Who knew erayons eould wait so dejectedly eloquent?

Central Hygiene and Ap-
parel

Though I failed to visrr the nth.
letlc tacrlirics (an unforrunare omis-
sion l'llanoro when submitting this
study to scholarly yonrnsls), Central
studenn were very sporty and very
not-smelly.

Central Dating
Cenrril studenrs do not hookeup,
have rlrngs. or partake in romance they
have to be rold about later by nrher people:

one I've never experienced at Grinnell with such full forees
I sense they are baslcrlly making run orrhe professor most

does giggle oddly, but they seem too rude. Gary agrees.

Central Studying

Data: minimal.

8:45 am. i hear one guy say to another, “My W:tt:r’_s

library, l’m not quit: sur: Wl’ml’ to nuke of this. so 1 deem

me wonder how hard the librarians need to work to attlact
