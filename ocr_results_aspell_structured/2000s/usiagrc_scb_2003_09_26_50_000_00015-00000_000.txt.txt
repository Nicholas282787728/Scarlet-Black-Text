Though she hasn't lost s set in singles or douhles this year, Khaiuria
never once considered enteiing the intercollegiate

rather than focusing on drills to improve technique.

“We've heen uhle to take a yiimp and spend more time on smite

Waite. “At the beginning or the year, we spent a lot oriiine just gale
ting to know ourselves, hut in the last couple orviieeks we've reached
the point where we have a clear vision ofwhat we can do as a team
As the season progresses, we're inst trying to hone our skills and re
hearse those- skills so that they become automaiic."

Looking ahead to Conference, Waite thinks this depth will help
