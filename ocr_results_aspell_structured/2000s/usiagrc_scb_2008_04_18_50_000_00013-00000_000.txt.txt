Your wildest dreams \Vill come tine.

I dont know much about Assassins statistics,
but I would guess that most people are killed
outside the dining hall or near their room. Well,
that's convenient, considering (he only things 1
do at the moment are sleep and eat. All the “safe
zones" are academic havens like Burling and the
Marhlan and the science library » convenient if
you do lots of homework, inconvenient ifyou do
lots of nothing.

I don’t know how this will turn out—whether
I’ll kill my targets or how I’ll die. 1 just know that
I’ve never been this alert (sweet!) or this distrustr
ful ofGtinnellians (not so much!).

Ifyou see me on Friday, come up to me and
ask me how it went. Maybe I’Ll brandish my
sweet $40 price and rake you out to Chuong

The Idea behind the cameras: benefits and pitfalls

Three weeks ago, our return from spring Break was marked
by the addition of two closedscircuit television cameras to the
mail room, From what I know and from what I assume most
students have reasoned, rhe cdmeiris are in place a. a pair of
the investigation into the hate crimes that occurred on campus,
monitoring the mailroom to either deter or catch anyone bent
on sending hate mail to anyone on campus again. Since the
camcras’placcmcnr.1’vc witnessed a range of reactions from
students, from something approximating rage ovei a perceived
betrayal of the student body by the administration, to sympathy
for the cameras’installation as a protective measure against hate
mailings occurring again. This situation has been especially
complex, painful, and dtdwnrout for me since l’m not only
responsible for e chairing the safety and security Advisory
Committee, in which the recent camera policy passed by Joint
Board was crafted, authored a majoiity of the policy itself, but
I was (he one student on campus who knew about the cameras
installation before it happened.

As the primary proponenr and writer of the camera policy
I was consulted by Elena Bernal the second week before spring
break about the installation of the mailroom cameras. Elena
shared with me that the ﬁndings ofthe investigation had created
an imperative need for cameras in
the mailroom and that cameras
would be installed over spring
break, She asked me to keep our
conversation conﬁdential out ofthe
need to successfully deter potential
future hate crimes or attacks, but she also explained that she
was in an extremely difficult po. ion ofwariting to engage with
students about the cameras but also maintain the integrity of
the investigation while lacking any set framework within which
to do it. Thus, she chose to consult me when she was under no
constraints to do so, to try and open up at least one channel of
dialogue about the cameras with students. Ifthere was a failure
to question my silence about my prior knowledge or not to
engage the greater student community, that fault was and is
purely mine. I actively sympathized with her then and srill do
now about the installment of the cameras, and felt placed in a
similarly difﬁcult position. I felt that our security as a strident
body, to say nothing of my friends- and any of the orher 34
students whose lives and sense of safety and community were
shattered by the hate mail. overrode any violation of privaeyl
might feel from having a camera record the checking my mail.
1 could not weigh my or any other students discomfort in the
mailroom against the real wellrbeing of another; 1 will never
ask for anyone who was or could potentially have been targctcrl

to go through what they did again.

The backlash I'vc witnessed about the lack ofnoticc Students
were given about the cmncras'insmllarion and the lack ofstudent
involvement in the process of implementing them has been
especialll difﬁcult for me to witch I've been remote from these
sentiments because of my prior knowledge and I feel incredibly
guilty for not sharing that information with nearly anyone else
until now I deeply apologize to everyone for keeping silent
about this for so long, and ifunyone reading this has questions
or concerns about how and why I handled the situation in the
mannerI did at all, please come and talk to me.I can and do not
fault Elena for asking me to rcm in silent at all; I don't believe
that she would have either i ally approached me or have
asked me to keep the information conﬁdential if the situat
wasn't complicated by rlic rigors of an ongoing investi at
and if she hadn't wanted to trust me in this process. I bclim'c
that Elena and everyone else in the college administration did
the best they could during an incredibly difficult time, without
any guiding protocol or policy on record (the policy passed by
John Board will only become active after having been approved
by both our new Vice-President for Student Affairs Houston
Dougharry and President Osgood). From my perspective,
Elena did seek our limited student awareness
and input about the installation, but with
rhe understanding that if the cameras were
to act as a successful deterrent, any potential
perpetrator couldn’t know about their
installation, While that processealong with
my role of remaining silent within itieertilinly had its flaws,1
do believe that the interest ofthe Student body was served. It is
overwhelmingly because Elena initially approached me about
the cameras and her continued conversation and engagement
with me throughout this process that I do firmly bclicvc that
the Ci'imcras installation occurred only with the safety of the
greater college community at the root of all action, and never
itirith the explicit' intent that students have been ostracized from
this process

The larger question for rue has thus become what to do
from here. I personally believe that as unique as the cameras
installation has been to the hate mail, as active as Elena
and llouston have been about engaging all students who
approach them with questions or concerns about the cameras,
as responsive as security and student Affairs have been ro
student outcry against cameras on 8th Avenue in the past, and
those departments’ continued engagement of the student body
in the twosyear process of foiming a camera policy through
SGA, thcsc cameras wrll not set a precedent for installing

others without student input in the future. However, within
that understandingl think thar we as a community need to
begin a clear and open dialogue about the manner in which

’we trust Security and Student Affairs to preserve student

interests on campus I think that the greater question oftrust
inhcrcntly underlies all ofwhar has happened with the camera’s
implcrnenration,aud1 firmly believe that this process rs integral
to forming a comprehensive and proactive camera policy. Nearly
more than anyone else. I'm painfully aware of how much trust
this situation has demanded from us as students and how much
responsibility that places on the administration,

I have overwhelming faith in Houston and Elena as
working partners in answering these questions and engaging
with smdents generally; 1 have never witnessed the degree of
openness and willingness to level completely and directly with
students that they ve demonstrated from any administrator' in a
position comparable to theirs. I additionally think that Houston
himself presents a fantastic oppormnity for us as students to
rethink what we’d like to see from Strident Affairs in terms
of engagement, involvement, and advocacy with students. I
therefore strongly encourage anyone and everyone interested in
this process to getinvolved; Houston and Elena, myself, current
SGA senators, and the current and future SGA cabinet are all
ready to begin this conversation.
