been posted online to
receive feedback from
the Grinnell community before the ﬁlial
policy is olheiully released.

“We wanted something in pine before
classes started, but we weren't in it position
to put it out there for community feed
back beforehand," Dean of Students Travis
Greene said, “So mther thun rushing to get
something done without extensive commUr
nity feedback we decided to wait, and we can
implement it once it's been approved and
vetted.

However, many feel the time frume pro
vided for student input is insufﬁcient.

“I think it is problematic and hypocritical

tor the administration to take over it your to
create the document but then only allow stilt
dents and community members ﬁve days to
respond," said Latonri Giwu '095, a member
of the No Limits Project.

As illustrated through n series of 5&3
Letter to the Editors, a group ot concerned
students have planned to petition to extend
the student response period on the policy
draft. The policy has achieved its stated goal
ofspreadmg awareness.

“[Havrng a protocol] gives a clear sense
to anyone who’s motivated to do something
like that ofwhat the consequences could he,
would be, and how they would play out in the
community," Bernal said.

Trustee open Forum in review

3v CAROLIN SCHOLZ

Presenting a wealth of information
regarding various clubs and organiza-
tions on campus, Grinnell College’s bian-
nual trustee forum establishes a unique
bridge of communication between cur
rent Grinncll students and members on
the board of trustees. An opportunity for
current students to promote groups that
they are involved in, the trustee forum is
one or the various vehicles through which
students can contribute to shaping both
the present and (h: future ofGrinnell.

The most recent trustee forum, held
Thursday in the South Forum lounge,
featured presentations from representa-
tives ofstudents for Responsible invest-
ment (SR1), Grinnell Dance Marathon,
No Limits and the Stonewnll Resource
Center (SRC).\’Vrth the aid ofpicsenta—
rions, these glcups were able to nitlenlnre
the priorities, accomplishments, and goals
of the given organization.

“Students continue to do i\ really good
job at the presentation and they say very
compelling sorts ofthings,“said Joe Hill-
cr'lZ.

More than simply an illustration of
organizations on campus, the trustee fo—

rum functions as an informative and edu-
cational experience for the members of
the board oftrnstees.

"It gives us more exposure to student
views and is always worthwhile,"said Rob
Sanders, a member of Grinnell College‘s
board of trustees. “It is more input from
the college community as opposed to just
meeting with the SGA people."

Despite the productive exchange be-
tween current smdenrs and trustees that
these forums encourage, many partici—
pants are continually disheartened by the
Lick of attendance by both students and
trustee membersiroughly 10 trustees-
and 20 students including SGA and pies
scnters.

“I am alwa ~ disappointed or the
number of trust - uho show up and the
number ofsrndenrs who shou- up, and (0*
night was no exception,"Joretl Rubinstein
'10 said. “It is alive, good for the people
who do (onlcmbut it would he really nice
if like 30 trustees camel We could show
people who don't know whnt we are talkr
ing about new things."

The trustee forum is in medium
through which the Grinnell community
can engage with the board of trustees.
