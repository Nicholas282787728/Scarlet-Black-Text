Bowl I rig
tips
. Always lie ready to take
yourtum on the lane
to avoid keeping others
waiting. Don’t go to the
har or the hathroom right
herore your turn.
when approaching the
lane, remember that the
player to the right has the
right ormay. But it the
player to your iert picks
a ball from the rack first,
be nice and let him or her
bowl ﬁrst.
Stay in your own approach
area, returning to the back
orthe approach after your
hall hits the pins (or rails
in the gutter).
Don’t distract a bowler
once he or she takes
a position. It’s bad
sportsmanship and torrid
be dangerous (bowling
balls are heavy).
Stay behind the foul line
(the line at the end of the
lane) at all times.
Be a good loser and a
modest winner. "loo much
leaping about and shouting
may cause uttered" a

Strikes and spares

Students strike out at Buff’s Bowladrome, located on State Street, but
declare bowling good fun anyway and resolve to return someday soon

BY ERIC ROHN

It was the week of midsenis, and I
was on n quest to he like Dude Leh-
owski. Ten pins, a couple of dollars, 1
ball and 1| couple of friends sounded
like nothing less than an exciting night
ofbowling to me,r1nd lwns determined
to make it hnppeu.

With no cir it my disposri rny op-
tions were limited to Grinncll s only lll’
ley. But} 5 Bowlndroine, rust two blot-Ls
souch or Buclsheurn. I put my pile of
essays iisldc and 5N otton my journey
hoping it good garlic ofliowling would
offset the stress of midscms

From the outside, Buff’s Bowlnd-
tome hardly looks like it's open. In the
slime set of buildings iis the (.ilso frinr
tnstic) ASLM Cote, a faded cutout of
a bowling ball and pin above the door
provide rho only idcnricrcruion.

However, on the inside, the piece
has an amazing vihrancy. especially
when ﬁlled up with league plnyars. The
décor and smell ere perfecr tor rhe clns-
sic bowling alley, and televised displays
record scores urid play short clips lifter
each player bowls.

The alloy has anything o cisuol, or
even serious, bowler might wanr for a
good point. While the alley looks relrr

tivcly small and cramped from the or

rcrior, it sports 10 full lines 1nd spicc
for lockers and ball storage. In addition
to bowling, the alley has n hiir and a
limited lood selection (for (hr: essentinl
srizick brmks rhc game dcm- inds).

Though thc olicy is open for he
dividuiil play, it rilso has an extensive
league p11y schedule. The alloy sporrs
men's, women's, children‘s and mixed
lcngllcs rhnc play scheduled days
throughout rlrc wcck

Fol more casual bowlers, the
league schedule tin be it hit ditiicrrlt

Buff’s basics

Hours
Seven days a week, 1:30 or 2 pm. to
9:30 or 10 p.m.

Costs
Games: $2.90, shoe rental: $1r
escaping schoolwork: priceless

So whnr is exactly chc 1rrrrction of
bowling? For 1 genre rhnt seems to hive
1 stereotype ofheing tor old nnti lazy
men, it is surprisingly fun to plny.

While the grime is nor the most nth-
lctic otsporrs, with o couplc ottricnds
rind .1 good sense of humor (cvcryonc
bowls 2| gultcl‘ billl sometimes...). the
gﬂmt: Clm be n groin diversion from n
night oftcdious studying or paper writ
ing Throwing the heavy bull down the
lrrne and watching the pins scatter is
not only sii fv'rng, but can he n grant
cathartic experience

My quest to ploy a glnic orhowlrng
before the end oi niidscms week w.is
folletl.VVl-il.lc I mllnilgetl ro chop hy the
rilley scvcml rirnes, the odd hours 1nd
the schcdulc oflcriguc play rnodc ir im-
possible in rlic end.

1 made my final trip to alley thiit
Wednesdny night, when i watched the
men's league is rhey pluyed 1 round of
tournament games. Sure they wore scri-
Oils rhout the game nnd bowling sets of
ﬁve strikes in n row (a feat I could never
accomplish), hut rhey were enjoying
themselves like I liadn r all week

So the next time I in lccling bogged
down by work, I ll remember Walters
wise words in The Big Lebowski: “I?“
it Dude, lcr's go bowling.”
