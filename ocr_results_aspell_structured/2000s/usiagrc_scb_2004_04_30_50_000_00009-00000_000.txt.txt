Remembering Pam Ferguson

The announcement that one of the ﬁnalists for the
Grinnell presidency in 1990 was a woman treated a big
buzz around campus A smaller, but no less enthusiastic
buzz invaded my part vfthe sdence building when we
leamed she was a mathematician. Not just any
mathematician, but a mathematician with a long list of
publications in leading jnumals, some published while
she was provost at the University of Miami. We were
enthused and perhaps a wee bit daunted.

Soon atter she arrived, 1 made an appointment to
introduce myselfto her because she had issued a general
invitation for us to do so, I was nervous meeting our new
president, but was sumrised by what seemed like
newousness on her part I appreciated the chance to
meet her and tell her about the statistis side of campus
and from mat point on, Ifelt as if Pain was in my corner.
She was always very supportive ot me as my president
and, tor the past six years, as my departmental colleague.

Given but a Single word to describe how I remember
Pam as president, r might pick ”ubiquitous.” it you went
to a play, concert presentation, athletic event or
whatever, you were going to see Pam there. Once
someone asked her what it was she liked about athletic
events and she said, "I like to win!" She reveled in
Grinnellians doing well and being creative, and Students
loved her for that.

Pam was an elegant president in all respects. She
carried herself with poise, dressed well and spoke well
She knew how to he pren‘dential. Pam was also the
quintessential good sport One instance is legendary. One
year our women's swim team clinched a cnnterence
championship at home. aeroie the last swimmer was
barely nut nt the pool, a collective gasp rose from the
fans as Pam mounted the high dive, decked outin her
gray sweats, and stuck a gracehrl head ﬁrst dive into the
FEE pool. rhe tans went wild and the team jumped in to
celebrate with her.

Pam set the standard lor coping with cancer. she did
her job, showed up every day and invited no one's
sympathy. she was remarkably just Pain throughout. Pain
usually greeted or said goodbye with the same. cheerful
"Hay ho!” I will miss hearing that Salutation and I will
miss Pam very much.

—TIJrrr Moore, Mowernati'zs

Outside of a few glimpses of Pam when she
interviewed on-campus inr the presidency, my first
solid impression of her was at a dinner site hosted
shortly after she had begun her tenure here. Most,
if not all, of the faculty were invited, but Pam made
a point to talk to me as a member or the Math
Department (the youngest one at the time). She, as
we all know, had a long career in teaching college
mathematics (as well as being a very active
researtil scholar) and she wanted to acquaint
herseli with the Mathematics Department and its
inhabitants al Grinnell.

her vivacious, lively and witty personality was
immediately obvious as we spoke and I'm airaid I
could not keep up my end or the conversation very
well, At some point she intimated that her
experiences with other mathematicians had not
always been completely satisfying: they were often
a iathei socially challenged hunch, something I
couldn't really deny. Well, I took this as a challenge
and whenever I worked with her] know I tried to
make myseli a more presentable representative ot
the speties,

As a performer in Sewing-Lewis hall, an
absolutely rahulnus space, I owe a great deal to
Fain. She was certainly a prime mover in the
tonstruction of such a facility. During her first
semester at teaching in our department I had a
recital and I have a wonderful memory of walking
onto stage and racing the audience and seeing
Roger and Pam (they must of driven in from Des
Moines) Sitting dead center in the hall she created
and it added a great deal to the evening.

rhe energy and excitement that she brought to
her teaching was in evidence every day she taught
here. Most folk battling with canter for as long as
she did would have given up the protessinn much
earlier, but not Pam. Her teaching and her students
were essential to hei. she will be greatly missed,

Ferguson made a lasting impression on Grinnell

Ferguson, cont. from p.1

Being accessible and helpful to srudenu wasn'r just something
that Ferguson did. It ms pan of who she was. When Lindsey
Bulnnbh ‘04 rank Ferguson’s inrcgrnl Calculus class, she was nor.
vous. aulhndr had always srrugglbd wirh mnrh rnd raking the
class from a former president otrhe college didn't do anyrhing to
lessen her onxicry Bur Ferguson's manner did. In class, Ferguson
would joke char she was “a mathematician who couldn’t do arirh»
merib," Buiﬁnch said. “She was seifeeffacing and down ro earth
and at the same rime she had such presence and digmry. lr
made me more comfortable about approaching her."

It's nor unusual for Ferguson's sense othumor ro be remem—
bered as “interesting. " “I really liked how she didn't alwnys say rhb
mosr appropriare things," said Emily Resseger ‘01. “Somerimes
what she said seemed sort of awkward and unpolishbd, which
probably didn't go over real well wirh rhb rrusrbes when she was
president, bur 1 liked ir, I remember when r had her in cross shc
made a big deal about handwriring: “Now Murry has rhe nicesr
handwriting in me class, bur Emily has rhc biggcsr handwritingi'"

Leadership and legacies

Much like her problem-solving sryle, Ferguson's approach ro
adminisrrarivb decision-making was very collaborative. Duke, who
was rhb dean ofsrudenrs during Ferguson‘s tenure as presidenr,
recalled that her goal was to put together an directive administra»
rion. She said righr from the beginning, rm nor an expert in
bveryrhing rwnnr ro hire and appoint people who are and make
sure rhby undersrand rhcir responsibilities and supporr rhern, '
Duke recalled. It wasnt her telling us whnr ro do at all 7 it really
wag working together just like a good teacher."

Even when people asked her about her areas or expertise,
Ferguson's advice sounded more like encouragement than instruc»
rion, When President Russell Osgood rook Ferguson’s posirion in
1998, he would occasionally seek her advice. “She made a point

of never answering my speciﬁc guesrions abour what she would
do if she were president,” Osgood said. “She would never say,
‘Russbll, you should do y.’ she would ask, ‘Flnvb you rhoughr
nbour vzr"

”SI-re had a Way or always asking questions that made me
rhink," Osgood said. “1r would enlarge rhe scope otrhe way you
looked at a problem.”

As president, Ferguson nbver wnnrbd righr conrrol over her
adminisrrarion, bur she did work ro pursue several speciﬁc and
orrbn ambitious goals. some ofher biggbsr legacies arc the build.
ing projects complcrbd during her tenure as president. According
ro her husband, Ferguson considered the construction of
bucksbourn to be her ﬁrst priority and the cnpsrone ofher presir
denby. The proibcr bosr abour $23 million, and required her ro
organize a massive campaign tor funding, despirb rhb dithculry or
rrying ro raise money for me one. According ro her husband
Ferguson saw a ﬁne arrs cbnrcr as on esscllrial uddirion ro a col.
lege in the middle otcornnrlds.

Another other building projects was the renovation orNoybb
Science center. “TI-re thing she believed in was the academics of
the insrirurion," Roger Ferguson said. “rryou’re going ro be one
orrhe top five colleges [in rhe bounrry] b and she really believed
Grinneli could be _ you have ro have taciliribs that go above and
beyond." Ferguson believed rhat Grinncll had always been a leader
in me sciences, bur ncedbd bcrrer tociliries. Shc organized o cam-
paign rhor raised $15 million and established an extremely CD"
lobomrive planning process. A faculty committee worked direcrly
wirh an nrchirbcr to design rhe renovnrions, right down ro rhe
venrilarion system, Duke continues ro apprebinrb rhe my Ferguson
allowed rhe cornmirreb ro make such hnndson decisions. “The
success otrhar buildingcumb ourotrhe planning commirtcb," he
said.

After ralking to people on all sides otthe issue, Ferguson deb
bided to support son‘s decision. “rrwas awondcrful momenr, an
imporranr moment for rhe queer community,” ThorsonvSmirh
said. “I just had rhe mosr profound respecr for her for malu'ng

Wns u very principled decision. I’II never forget those srudenrs

rheir lives depended on ir. \V/har she did meant everything to

Ferguson was also particularly concerned wirh increasing rhe
diversity ofrhc faculty. “She was very commirrbd ro diversiry and
very disappoinrbd rhor she wasn't able to diversity the faculty
more," Roger said, even while adding rhat rhc “inculry during her
rcrrn diversiﬁed dramatically"

Even after her term as president, Ferguson continued her eFA
torrs to support campus diversity. Molly Quinn “05 appreciated
