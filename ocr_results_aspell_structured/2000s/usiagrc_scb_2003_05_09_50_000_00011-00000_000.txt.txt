Concerns about graduation speaker

Ordinarily. one doesn'r wrire a loner ro rhe ediror abour an event
rhar railed ro rranspire, bur rhis, l believe, is a proper exception. l
reeenrly deeided ro aerend this year's eommeneernern ceremonyi
my own, and the one my family I5 rraveling 800 miles ro see—doe
spire serious misgivings about she giaduarron speaker, Tim Wise.
Those misgivings nearly led me ro boyeorr eommeneemenr enrirely,
an ace orprorese rhar professor Karya Gibel Azoulay dissuaded me
from pursuing. My obiecrion ro Mr. Wises po.
sirion as honorary speaker, however. remains
quite strong. and i would like ro explain my
concerns below:

i, Mr. Wise embraces a radically egalirarian
polirical agenda—one so inrenr on leveling dif»
ferences rharl do nor believe ir can some wirh
individual freedom and equaliry under rho law.
While his views probably enjoy Widespread sup.
port on campus, I ﬁnd his polmml persona as a
whole quire rroubling, Mr, Wise has builr a in»
reer on racial guilr raeries, and despire his sup.
posed populism, holds posirioos rhar lie along
rhe polirieal fringe,

2. Mr, Wise makes his living in large part (and perhaps primn»
rily) as a professional speaker. i do nor rhink rhar a man who spends
his life arrendiiig conferences has much ro tell us abour the place or
rhe liberal arrs in life and rhe wider world.

3. Mr. Wise in my opinion, lacks rhe inrelleeriial eredenrials rhar
are normally expected ora college graduarion speaker. He holds only
a bachelor's degree from a seeoiid.rnre universiry, and has eonrrib.
ured lirrle, iianyrhing, ro ihe world orirleas. Mosr orhis published

books and arrieles are reprisals orold proposals {or raeial undersrande
mg.

I do not think that a man
who spends his life at-
tending conferences has
much to tell us about the
place of the liberal arts in
life and the wider world.

4, Mr. Wise, rhough osrensiblylewish, has a long hisrory orcom.
menrs rhar suggest antl»Scmitism. Most orrhis, norsurprisingly. stems
from his wrirings on lsrael and Zionism. While Eh: siruarion in she
Middle Easr, as well as rhe policies or she lsraeli government and
Palesrinian Authority, are oerrainly open ro debare, Mr, Wise does
nor view ehe existence orlsrael, in any term and under any circum—
sranes. as legirimare. in his words, Zionism “amounrs ro erhnieehau.

right so something granted every odier people
in rhe world; rhis is and-Jewish bigotry masquere
ading as enlighrened humanitarianismr (see

5. Finally, Mr. Wise has already spoken at
crinnell ar lease oviee in rhe pase few years. Any
seniors who were interested in hearing him have already had ample
opporruniry ro do so. Even ifall or my other eoneerns are brushed
aside. 1 simply do nor undersrand why me commencemenr Com-

Greening Grinnell’s graduation

The picnic following this year’s commencement
(Monday, May 19) willinclude a new recycling program.
In addition to can and bottle recycling at the picnic,
the College will offer bins for food scraps] which will be
composted and reused in landscaping. Look forthe waste
station tent to the immediate west of the beverage
station during the meal to contribute to the program.
Your leftovers will become a nutrient—rich soil amends
merit that will help control stormwater runoff, reduce
soil erosion, and promote plant growth. By diverting
material away from the waste stream the College saves
money, adds lifespan to Iowa’s landﬁlls, and creates
value from items that otherwise would have been oth-
erwise discarded. The College plans to begin composting
all food scraps upon the adventor centralized dining in
2005.

Notes to (mostly) unnamed people‘

“To Lola Garcia who writes of approximately 95% of
the rants in the 5&8: why don’t you let someone else
complain?

“To whoever authon'zed a lockrdown from the "town
crazy mani” ridiculousr

*To those who mix banana peels, coffee, mayo and
bread in their cups at Quad: stop it, fuckers.

“To the dinning hall cooks: while marshmallows and
oil are nice foods in moderation, the absurd usage of
both ingredients has got to stop.

‘To the way cute, sweet, nice girl dating the coolest
guy here: can't you he a little mean so 1 can hate
you?

'To those who have loud sex at 7 arm. and 5 pam:
everyone can hear you. '

‘Lastly, to those who don't shower: I don’t care if
cleanliness is a “social construction,” you smell.

It’s not like you are making music

Multiple times a dayI hear, in my loggia-side room
on South Campus, a sound not unlike a derailed train
that crashes into a bunch of wooden boxes and metal
tmsh cans. Is it the train running into the Forum?
No. Is it someone pulling a wagon at high speed to
deliver cookies during Hell Week? No. It is skateboard—
ers who feel that doing their failing tricks inside the
loggia will make them better. They certainly aren’t
doing it to make friends with people trying to sleep,
do homework, or hold onto any sort of thoughts I
knowthere is a little ramp going into Quad. 1 know
the loggiz is nice and smooth I know it’s been rain-
ing. But please, humor everyone and practice some
where else
