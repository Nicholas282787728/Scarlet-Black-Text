8&8 on Advertising

We’Ve heard the whispers and seen the
random rants railing ag‘ rsr
the 5&3 for printing ads
from companies that some
of Grinnell's more socially
minded may take offense
with, But like most prefer
sional ncwepapers, the $3312
maintains a separation between its editorial
and busintss decisions.

we do not ban any corporations or indir
viduals from purchasing adverri, ng in the
nervspaper.This policy is in place to make sure
there is no conﬂict of interest for the articles
we publish. For example, irwe rejected an ad
verrisernent from one presidential candidate
because we did not agree wrth their policy, we
could no longer claim objectivity in articles we
publish on that candid e.

We also keep our busrness section separate
from our editorial staff. Our business editors
play no role in assigning or editing ar ricles, and
do notwrite or express their voices in staffed'r
torials. We keep this wall in place so rhar no
conﬂict of interest can arise when we do have to

staff Editoriél

Wal-mart ads and dining hall expectations

make decisions about which ads to accept due
to space limitation. Some people may question
why the 5&3 even bothers to run ads.

Likcall campus publications,
we receive our loading from
SPARC.\vhicll in turn draws its
budget from the student holivir
tics tee. While the 5m: relies on
SPARC for most or our opera-
tion costs, the addrtronal revenue
generated through advertising allow-s us to not
only increase what we are capable of funding,
but it also frees up more SPARC money for the
creation ofnew student publications.

Don’t close stir-fry!

For those or" us whose families are visiting,
Family Weekend is a time to show off our sec-
ond homer Unfortunately, this was mild: difr
ﬁcult given the lackluster state or the dining
hall over the weekend. on a typical weekend,
the dining hill closes down d few stations due
to decreased numbers ofstudents who eat meals
over the weekendThat's understandable.

Yet on Family Weekend, where there will
clearly be a larger-Lhawnomlnl amount of din»
ets, the dining hall still ran at only abour half

capacity.

Multiple stations were closed, and lines for
the few stations thar were open were very long,
Family members who decide to support the
school rather thlln inrtown businesses shouldn't
have to choose between a slice of p to and a
bowl of soup, particularly in a brand new din-
rng i‘acilrty with the crpatrry to support nrulriplc
meal options.

The contrast here with admitted student
weekends is starkiweekcnd nights in April
often feature scrumptious Indran tood, Asian
Noodle Bar, or- any other of those yummy dine
ing hall specials.

our fmiilies should get the same treatment.
Aren‘t our parents usually the ones paying for it
in the ﬁrst place?

Family weekend also serves as an unufr
ticial prospie weekend, as many high-schoole
age younger siblings come along to consrdcr
Grinnell.They couldn't have been impressed by
the dreitry options available to them this week
end,

so next year, Dining Services, please give
our ﬁlmih‘es the star treatment rind show them
|he best Grinncll has to offer. Don‘t our families
deserve as much?
