So much for reality

, Indie ﬁlm on shoestring budget builds waking dream

BY COURTNEY SHEEHAN

I first heard about “Ink" while working
at the Northwest Film Forum in Scattle this
past summer. While attempting to write a
blurb about it for their calendar without hav-
ing seen the film, 1 looked to other reviews
to figure out the gist ofit, I found that critics
were salivating all over this juicy slice ofindie
scisri, Compared to movies like “The Matrix,”
“Brazil" and “Pan's Labyrinth" but made on a
shoestring budget, “Ink” is about the two op-
posing forces that inspire oilr dreams at ni ht.

worldly premise really do resonate with the
darkest depths orour minds at nlglitﬂt in
high school, Director Jamin VVinans shot the
film on DVin and around Denver, then edited
and scored it himself. Critics have described
the plot as complex but well erecutedeyou
can imagine how a story structured on dream
logic would unfold, somewhat disorienting
but strangely familiar,

When the good guy Storytellers gather
to rescue Emma, several highly praised right
se uences with the Incubi ensue. Winans

Storytellers are the be- —% and talented CinclnﬂtoglﬂT

nevolent givers of good
dreams, while sinister In-
cubi attack us with night—
mares. When an Incubi
bounty hunter steals away
a little girl, her dad must
come to terms with his
own failures as a father in
order to save her.

Ever since discovering its existence this
summer, 1 have been dying to see this film.1
wish 1 could sayl have and present you with a
stellar~or who knows, maybe not so stellari
review ofthis “Ink,”but the DVD was just re-
leased this week and did not arrive in time for
a preview. That being said,l am stoked to go

_ see it today at 4:30 and if you watch the trailer
once, I bet you will be too.

Granted, the trailer does lend itself to
making unﬂattering comparisons to that ang-
sty high school geek who scribbled Avenged
Sevenfold lyrics over the picture or his ex
taped right next to the "Donnie Darko” poster
in his locker. But that may just be because

Freesound artists will take the stag'e in
the Gardner Lounge at 8 p.m., Saturday
Nov. 14. The event, named ”Showvcmber,"
will feature acts ranging from opiates
soundrsmashing mete
al to Italian VVhore’s
ambient postsrock
sound.

Taking into ac-
count the widc va-
riety of styles in-
volved, Freesound has
planned for a show
that reﬂects ti cons
stant ﬂow of mustc
trom genre to genre
rather than a more
typical divided dem-
onstration of differ-
ent bands.

“This show is just
going to be kind of
crazy. We are going to
have a lot otditrereiir ricts,just everyone who
ls,involved with Freesoundiit should be a
variety show,"Mikc Kober '10 said. “We are
going to have pretty much the same set up
the more night so bands can move pretty
ﬂuidly, people can just plug in."

The progrrtnn is as much about showcas-
ing Grinnell talent as it is about givmg mus
sicians on campus a way to meet other musir
cians and collaborate, fostering artist growrh

yust a movie about dreaming,

pher jeff Pointer make up
for their lack of bullet-time
photography with whip
-smart editing techniques
and atmospheric lighting,

Even given my concern
with the white-male hege»
many in ﬁlmmaking, 1 still
dig plenty of white dude
movies. I cant wait to discover if "Ink" holds
out on its promise to sweep you away into a
universe that so creatively and resourcefully
approximates the substance or our sleeping
selves. There's a reason that watching movies
is constantly compared to dreaming—both
are transforing activities that surround you in
darkness and by eroding the limits of waking
reality, open up new possibilities for experie
ence.

l have a feeling that “Ink" has been called
the new ‘it’ movie because it so brilliantly
depicts this departure from consciousness.
something tells me this isn't just a movie
about dreaming, but rather, the tworway street
between movie—land and‘dream-land.

for all involved. Sam Peterson '11 and Eliyah
Afzal '11 are both members of Opiate, but
they have also been in other bands in the
past two years and are planning to start new
bands in the next year.

“it music is your thing
and you're looking for other
kinds to jam with, Freesound
is your ticket," Peterson d.

Afziil, too, secs . tr
ing potential in the abilitics
of all of his Freesound co-
members, “You always want
to make a band, especially
when you first think of the
idea,"Afzal said. “You always
want to do at least one show
with a new band,}ust to test
it out.”

since 2006, the organiza-
tion has worked towards set
curing equipment, available
practice space and building
organizational structure.

There is now an equipment training process
for all who want to join and weekly meet-
ingsia far cry from the stereotypical slop—
piness ofa high school garage hand. But all
this doesn't mean it has sold out.

> “Freesound, like a high school teenager,
has grown up out or punk and into metal,"
Afzal said. “[1t is] slightly more regimentcd
but still offensive.”

Film’s Golden Age

by MATT BnTciiELL

on Thursday, Nov. 19, the Listening
Room is co—sponsoring a “Pizza and Movie
Night,” in honor of [he‘70rh anniversary
of 1939, one of the most deﬁning years in
Hollywood history,

Maddie Allen '10 and Rachel Smith'll
organized the event is part of the Listens
iiig Room’s month-long commemoration
of Hollywood’s “Golden Year "

1939 was monumental for Hollywood,
with the release ormany great classics such
as “The Wizard of Oz" and “Gone With
the Wind," That year. 10 ﬁlms were nomis
nntcd for Best Picture, instead orthe usual
ﬁve, with “Gone With the Wind” as the
first all-color film—and the longest ever
film at three hours and 54 minutes—to win.

“Since the Listening Room’s function
is to provide and maintain the video and
audio collection for the librariesY we are 31*
ways looking for projccts that will focus on
those collections and let the college coin-
inunity be aware of the vast assortment of
items available," said Randye Jones, the Li-
brary Assistant in charge of the Listening
Room.

To celebrate the 70th anniversary. Alt
len and Smith collaborated with the SCA
to show one of the Best Picture nominees.
SGA Films Committee secured the rights
necessary {or the screening, and SGA
Student Activities provided funding for

refreshments. “We were hoping to show
‘Wizard of Oz.’Wc thought it could be a
fun sort ofbEfWECUTHGHOWEEI‘TﬂndTFBKlSh
activity to do," Smith said.

The 70th Anniversary edition of “The
Wiziird of or" is being released this year,
turning the Listening Room from acquir-
ing the rights to show it. Instead, they will
show "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
starring James Stewart as an idealistic,
small town senator who must fend offrutllr
less politicians out to destroy him.Thcrilm
was controversiltl in its time, but was a box
office hit, and cemented James Stewart AS a
major movie star. . -

Listening Room assistants also put tot
gethet a number of posters, on display in
Burling, with information about movies of
that year, including ones that pushed the
boundaries of the era’s strict censorship
code, and early use of color in motion pic-
turcs.

“These films weren’t only good films
in terms of Hollywood blockbusters, but
in terms of technology and content mat-
ter they were also pretty progressive,"Alleii
said.

The Listening Room‘s showing will
serve not just as a break from the stresses
of these last few weeks of the semester, but
also as a celebration of ﬁlm'sieven Hollyt
wood ﬁlms—ability to challenge our social
assumptions.
