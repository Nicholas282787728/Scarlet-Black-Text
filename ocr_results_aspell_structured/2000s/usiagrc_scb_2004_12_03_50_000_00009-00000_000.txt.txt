Running just for the fun of it

A lot of people think it’s strange to
go running. “You do what?" they excl-aim,
brows furrowed in confusion. “You actu-
ally just, like, run? And nobody is chas-
ing you? Do you like going to the den-
tist, too?”

I like mnning, though. See
riously. I‘m notjust saying that
because 1 know it’s good for
me, or because 1 have any
athletic ability whatsoever.

No, I just like running.

Admittedly, it’s an ac-
quired taste, kind of like
caﬂeine; I never would
have become addicted to
the almost—black coffee
that I drink today if
i hadn't ﬁrst gotten
hooked on mocha
lattes. Likewise, I
never would have become a decently
in-shape iunner ifI hadn‘t spent some
time trotting around at the speed of a
sloth on Nyquil, taking frequent breaks
to pick dandelions and testis my shoes
for the 15th time.

Nowadays,1 consider running to be
a chance to get away from homework.

listen to music and see all sorts of weird

stuff that I would never witness while

jogging oii a tieadmill at the PEC, or

sitting around on the couch. Last No-

vember, as I was running through Bate

tersea Park in London,I saw a bearded

man in a Santa Claus suit, also jogging.

About two months ago, as I was head-

ed down Sixth Avenue in Grinnell,I

saw a woman walking a ferret down

the street on a leash,

The trouble is that once Iowan

winter sets in (as it has already

begun to do), running outdoors

ceases to be a slighdy inas-

ochistic activity and becomes

enjoyable only ifyou are the

sort of person who

likes to have eye-

lashcs encrusted

with ice. I won't

even describe the time i slipped on a

patch of ice and spent a humiliating

week or so hobbling around with a cane
at the young age of19.

Every winter I make a valiant at
tempt to replace running with swim—
ming. It's usually not very successful

swimming always manages to thor-

oughly humiliate me in some way or air
other. This trend began back in middle
school gym class. if there's anything
worse than being 13 and awkward, it’s
being 13 and awkward in a bathing suit,
in a cold pool, with 40 classmates ofeir
ther gender in close proximity Luckily,
it usually only took one or two post»pool
trips into the winter alt for my waist-
length hair. sopping with water, to freeze
into little chlorinated icicles. After that,
I would catch cold, get a note from my
mom and spend the rest of the swim
season sitting on the bench and wheez-
ing triumphantly while my classmates
paddled through the frigid water.

These days, I’m a little more conscir
entious about keeping my hair thawed
out; for one thing,I have much less hair
to deal with, Unfortunately: though, I
still haven't quite mastered the whole
swimming thing. It seems that while
I was busy coughing on the bench, I
missed some sort of important under-
water breathing lesson.

On those occasions when I venture
to the pool, there are usually laige num—
bers of people swimming the crawl. Stu-
dents, faculty, staff, townspeople, Rusty

K; I have seen them all, crawling along.
However,'in order to swim thc crawl
(which is supposedly one ofthe simplest
strokes out there) you have to keep your
face under water for about 50 percent
of the time you are swimming. 1 can at-
tempt to do this for about one-quarter
of a lap, and then I start to feel like I am
going to drown soon, so I stop.

It's funny, 1 know a lot of people
who love swimming, but hate running.
What is the explanation for this? Aren’t
they land-dwelling human beings, with
a constant need for oxygen? Do rill of
these swimmcrrpcople, (maybe even
Russell K) secretly have gills?

I try to console myself with the
thought that swimming fast isn't a very
userul skill anyway as long .151 can dog-
paddle, I’ll be able to survive most ships
wrecks And ifl get thrown into waters
infested with sharks or man—eating cols,
well, I'm probably screwed no matter
what. On the other hand, if I ever need
to outrun anyone. like a criminal or an
attack dog. I’ll be all set, Yup, it will he
me, Santa Claus, Forrest Gump and the
ferret, leading the way.

Confessions of a London columnist

We are entering our fourth month in
iolly Oldc England, and 1 figure widr my
ﬁnal column I should come clean and cry
to not get too big of a lump of coal for
Christmas.

Over the summer the onrcumpus
program director of Glinncll-in-Lon-
don, Anne Geissingcr, c-rnailcd me and
asked if] could do a little ﬁeld work for
her to beef up her reserves for future
GIL recnritrnent. Everything she asked
was pretty routine: wanting me to collect
fliers and whatnot, encourage my fcllow
GiLers to mke and send her digital pics
tures, and to possibly write a ‘letter to the
editor’ for the 3&8 around October to
extol lhc virtucs of GIL.

She olfererl to pay me for about 20
hours of work when all was said and
done, and being the work—study depen-
dent that 1 am, I jumped at the chance.
Bur as I thought on Anne's rcqucstl res
membcred that the SUB invites new coir
umnist every semester and pay them
too. Possibly more money-hungry than
interested in writing about London I ran
the idea by Anne, made some friends on
campus tell me when the column appli-
cation submissions werc due, and obvi-
ously submitted a good enough column
to get me a rcgmlar spot in our illustrious
SUB,

And now that you know the truth

behind how I got here, 1 must also con-

fess something more Despite some of

my more cynical and sarcastic tones
in my columns, l've actually had
quite a good time in London
and writing about it for the
543:8 (most likely because I
got to be sarcastic and Cynir
cal, but hey, who’s counts
ing).

lin originally from
Seattle and being in
smallrtown Grinnell
forascmesternsually
drives me batty. But \
being in London is ~

 

union acked.

lians rn London.l have to say tlidt one
of the bcst arguments for the GIL Pm,
gmm is simply that there are 20-
some-odd other Grinnellians to

dull the edge of the inevitable
homesickness of being so far

away. Really any study abroad

progmm can provide once

in a life-time opportunities

and learning experrences

and witty fodder for a

column in the $5513, but

apart fr r Grinnell-

iilrWasltingmn, no
other program can
give you all that and

 

 

like being home (it
helps that the climate of London and
the Northwest are very similar) and for
that, I‘ve greatly cn-
joycd spending l‘our
months in a city while
attending Grinnell
classes (rhough, be
tween you and me, the
GIL classes are a little
morc laid back and
easy than on campus
— so as to allow some
time to enjoy London
7 and 1 have enjoyed that as well).

But it's not just about being in Lonv
don, it’s about being with other Grinnel-

good time

the 5&8.

Despite some of my
more cynical and
sarcastic tones...l have
actually had quite a

and writing about it in

the fooling (even if it
is over so faint) ofrhe quii'kincss orGrin-
nell in a new and exciting place.

And for people
who me not Cll’y’
sllclscl's like inc—en-
jovlng rhe city with a
touch of Grinnelliit
is possible to think of
the scmcslel as Grin-
nell with a whole lot
of city, Eirhcr way, you
can't really argue with
all of the great things
about Grinnell in LondonAnd remem-
bcr what I've said bttforc> London off
(1) an ildvcnturously unreliable mass

in London

transit system called The Tube,’ animals
named crosswalks to protect pedestrians
from crazy drivers on the left side of the
road, (2) a monarchy which has endowed
England with castles, ceremonies and
fun versions of a national anthem, (3)
William Shakespeare's legacy of lots and
lots of theatre, and (4) undeniable Brit—
rsh politeness whrch barely masks their
current disgust at the American fearless
leadcr and, of course, fun with exchange
rates! “You can‘t beat Grll'll‘lcll’ln’LOH’
don!”

Smutmy salesman persona aside, if
you are looking for a study abroad pro»
grain,'it's worth consideringnnd ifynu'ro
not, well, you missed out, but you prob
ably made the right decision anyway. It's
not for cvcryonc,but the progmm cannot
be discounted just because it has Gr' -
nell stamped all over it,bccausc darn ' f
that's not its biggest selling pomtl

And with that last bit of propaganda
(backed by an honest confession of my
motivationswooJ should get involved
in American pohlics..,),1 can stop us
ing my powers of persuasion to make a
buck from poor Anne. Ii’all else fails and
she denies all knowledge ofonr agree-
ment, the SHE has paid inc, and I did
have some fun pretending to know how
to write a witty column. As the lovable
English say: Cheers!
