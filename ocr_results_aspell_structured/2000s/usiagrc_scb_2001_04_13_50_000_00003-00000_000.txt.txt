Green activist speaks

by David Nathan
Staff Writer

on Monday Giiiinell College's chaprcrofCampus Greens brought
David Cobb to speak on oimpus. Cobb's energetic presentation in
North Lounge mostly revolved around how the relationship between
corporations and society has changed over time One of Cobb's pro»
fessioiial goals as a lawyer and activist is to make corporation nets more
dependent on public approval,

Despite mild uses of cliched radical rhetoric, such :is the specch’s
tired opening “lfyou arcii'tpissed off. youaren’tpayiiigattention," the
presentation was engaging and unique. Cobb, who claimed Atticus

‘Fincli and Ralph Nader as his personal hcioes, repeatedly praised and

quoted Adam Smith's Wm/t/i r/Nrrn'znsand kcpt the tone light ihrough _

the use ofseveral lawyer rokes, usually aimed at himself in addition,
his passion ivas contagious.

”lit the beginning [of the United states], corporations could not
own land, could not own shares in other corporations, had a limited
life of l o to 15 years, and had to act in the public interest.“ said Cobb.
"if a corporation didn’t live up to this charter, its charter would be
revoked and this happened all the time.“

Over time, these icsriictions we gradually lifted until eventually,
corporations were granted rights equal to those ofindividual citizens
under the law at the end of the nineteenth century.

"The sysiem itself needs to be changed," said Cobb, "Forget the
EPA. lust at suffragettes were not asking for a voting administrative
agency, we shouldn’t be asking for an agency to protect the environ»

ment from corporations, corporations should have to ask [they pubs
licl ifthey can pollute the planet.“

Cobb pointed out that many significant decisions about society
are made by businesses.

"According to a recent survey, 85 percent ofAmericnns are op.
posed to eating genetically modiﬁed organisms and 95 percent of
Americans desire genetically modified foods to be labeled. But this
isn’t the raise. We cat unlabeled genetically modified foods [cverydayl
because ofa decision made by uncleeted, unaccountable CEOs be
hind closed doors. That my friends, is not a democracy, and that is not
iiistice.”

Prior to thespeech, Cobb had dinner with several campus activisis
in the forum coffee house where various forms of protest were dis»
cussed. Cobb, who helped organize the startle \Y/TO protest, pro.
moted the use of puppco, drums. and comedy,

“Good protests should be non threatening, and they should be
fun." said Cobb. .

Alcohol enforcement

atic bieath resting, Sitrig said, “She deﬁnitely had the
opportunity to rake more action, , but she chose not to.
We could have called in a couple troopers and sonic
deputy sheriffs."

There were approximately ten law enforcement of«
ficers at the party, said students; Petersen was unsure of
the exact number, though she decided that there were
eventually five Crinnoll PD squad cars andsevenil deputy
sheriffs' vehicles, which had apparently come of their
own accord,

Petersen, who was new to the nightshift two months
ago. said she was unaware whether or not police had
ever before entered Harris to enforce the drinking age,
Two weeks ago, she said, one student had been cited for
drunken driving under when he was found “sobering
up" in a car at thcsidc the street behind Harris.

Police also said they had been unatvaie ofrhe college’s
alcohol policy; Krohn and Crady said sittig was surv
prised to learn Wednesday that student Affairs keeps
track ofstudents who are taken to the l'lOSplml.

student reaction to the incident was extremely
mixed, with different respondents displaying apathy,
humor, cynicism, feat anger, and disbelief. By one re
port, even as students began to leave the party, one stut
dent stood at the door to Harris, urging others to turn
back and continue the festivities, regardless of orders by
police or ACE security.

A knot of students remained for a half-hour after
the party’s end, discussing the night's events and pos.
siblc ramifications with administrators and stafE

“lfyou actually enforce [the drinking age], Harris
will end," said Emily Mizc '01.

Paul Pasquesi '02. looked to the college to take
greater responsibility in educating ﬁrstyears on altos

know"

they existed, were “not an issue,"

"To get down to brass tacks, ifyou’rc iiiid 2i, it’s
illegal to consume or possess alcohol," said Si ig. “We
don't always have the resources to be everywhere st once,
so you might get away with drinking sit or seven times

‘A Few Good Men’

Jackson Katz, male anti-sexist activist, talks about
preventing rape and other gender—related violence

by Laura Polstein
Staff Writer

on Wednesday, lacksoii Kaospoke
energetically to a Harris Cinema audl»
ence of 250. To advertise the talk, the
Feminist Action Coalition (PAC) and
the sexual Assault Working Group
(SAWG). the groups that co—sponsorcd
the event, hung signs in the stalls of
the men's bathrooms on campus that
posed the question: “are you a rcal
man?"

This is the question that Katz and
those who work with him pose to
groups ofnien involved in sports, and
thc military as wcll as in college Setc
tings. From l988»‘98 he was (he chicf
organizer ofa male antusexist group in
Boston called “Real Men" whosc goals
were to bring the idea that rape is a
“men’s issue," not a “women's issue" to
the male consciousness and to challenge
traditional notions ofrnaseiilinityin the
entertainment and sports media.

Katz spoke extensively about the
role that the media plays in shaping our
ideas about violence. He made the
point that the news media “degenders”
violence by reporting that “women are
raped" or “teenage girls become prcgr
mm." The use of the passive voice in
these examples, said Katz, takes the
emphasis off the men who are raping
and iiiipregiiatingwoinen, He weiiton
to point out that the phrase “violsnce
against women" removes men from the
equation, decreasing the likelihood that
men will feel responsible identify tl'icmc
selves as activists working against this
problem,

lu his presentatioiisaiidworkshops,
Katz calls on men to take a pro—active
role in preventing violence and sexism
by “speaking out" when male buddies
make comments that reflect hyper mas.
culinity that boys in our society are
taught to internalize.

One of his main tools is :i
“playbook," a guide for men which
describes tactful ways to confront mi-
sogyny in social situations.

on Wednesday. l<atz also urged the
male portion ofthe audience to empat
thize with women by presenting the hy»

pothetical that the men in the room
were forced on a daily basis to take all
the precautions that women do to pre.
vent rape.

Part of his process was asking
women to list the things they do to
prevent rape, and it was striking that
even in Crinnell, which most people
would consider to be a relatively safe
place, the page was ﬁlled.

ln the same vein, Katz asked all the
women in the room who had received
obscene phone calls to raise their hands.
The overwhelming mayority ofwomen
did raise their hands, and when he
asked the same of men a smaller, but
not insignificant portion, ofthem said
that they had received an obscene
phone call.

l<atz seemed surprised by this re.
sponse. but in a smaller group discus.
sion after the talk he mentioned that
this audience was different than some
ofthe others he works with because of
the high percentage of malcs who are
victims of masculine culture in a dif-
ferent way than, for example, a meme
bet of the Mariuc Corps. At Grinnell
and other colleges, Katz said, many
malestudents were probably bullied or
otherwise directly victimized by hyper

masculinity, which changes their rc- .

sponse to these issues.

one response ofthe hyper mascu»
line world to feminism which l<atz
criticized emphatically is the use ofthe
tcrms“male»bt15hcr” and “femin i As
a Jew and a student of the Holocaust.
Katz is deeply offended by the use of
the second term because it associates
feminists. whom he believes arc at the
“forefront ofantirviolcncc" with Nazis.
who perpetrated massive and grotesque
violence not so long ago, He has, how-
ever, drawn parallels between Nazi
views on gender and women's roles and
the views of the New Right on those
issues.

Katz’s presentation was so enthral—
ling to many students that they stayed
afterwards for a question and answer
session that was eventually moved to a
lounge so that the movie Gladiator
could be shown in Harris.

10 things men can do to
prevent gender violence

1) Approach genderwolence as a MEN'S issue involving men
of all ages and sotiootonomie, racial and ethnic backgmunds.
view men not only as perpetrators or possible offenders, but .
as empowered bystanders who can confront abusive peers.

z) tfa brother fn‘end, classmate, or teammate is abusing his
female partner .. or is disrespectful or abusive to girls and
women in general .. don‘t look the other way. if you feel
comfortable doing so, trytotalk to him about it. Urge him to
seek help. or if you don‘t know whztto do, consult a friend,
a parent, a professor, or a counselor. DON'T REMAIN 3mm,

3) Have the courage to look inward. Question your own attia
iudes. Don't be defensive when something you do or say ends
up huiting someone ebc Try hard to understand how your
own attitudes and actions might inadvertently perpetuate
sexism and violence, and work toward changing them.

a) if you suspect that a woman close to you is being abused
or has been sexually assaulted, gently ask if you can help.

5) tfyou are emotionally, psychologically, physically. or sexu—
ally abusive to women, or have been in the past, seek pmfes»
sional help now.

a) be an ally to women who are working'tu end all forms of
gender violence. Support the work of campus-based women‘s
centers. Attendj‘iako Back the Night" rallies and other public
events, Raise money for community-based iape crisis centers
and battered women's shelters. If you belong to a team or
fraternity or another student group, organize a fundraiser.

7) Recognize and speak out against homophobia and gay-
bashing. Discrimination and wolencc against lesbians and
gays are wrong in and of themselves. This abuse also has
direct links to sexism (eg. the sexual orientation of men who
speak out against sexism is often questioned, a conscious or
unconscious strategy intended to silence them. This is a key
reason few men do so).

3) Attend pmgrams, take courses, watch films, and read at-
titlos and books about multicultural mastulinities, gender
inequality, and the root causes of gender violence. Educate
yourself and others about how larger social forces affect the
conflicts between individual men and women,

9) Don't fund sexism. Refuse to purchase any magazine, rent
any video, subscribe to any Web site, or buy any music that
portrays girls or women in a sexually degrading or abusive
manner. Protest sexism in the media.

10) Mentor and teach young boys about how to be men in
ways that don'tinvolve degrading or abusing girls and women.
Volunteer to work with gender violence prevention programs,
including anti-sexist men's programs. Lead by example.
