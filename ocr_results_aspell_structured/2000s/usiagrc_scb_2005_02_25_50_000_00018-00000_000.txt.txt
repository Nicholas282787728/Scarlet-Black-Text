The good, the bad and the ugly

Experts weigh in on who tore up the red carpet and whose dress should be torn up

Irthcre's one thing we get out or. 'heral arts education, it's the
ability to think critically. In the dblllryetorcriticize-cverything-uIc-
eneounter sense ot‘ the word, 50, what happens when we apply this
hald—eained and cxpcnswe ability to the height of entertainment
fashion? We get the 888's Oscai fashion critique, proudly presented
by those who haven't seen a fashionable day since the day they en-
tcred the wor'ld in their birthday suits.

This years Oscar fashion trumped all other recent years in terms
of sheer ugliness. well, except maybe last year, which was real/i bad

Too much Beyonce, too little humor

Clocking in at under fours, the 77th Academy Awards sacrificed class for efficiency

Bv DAVID MONTGOMERV

Congratulations, Clint. Maybe next year (again), Martin.

That’s the 2005 Academy Awards in a nutshell. If you didn't
see it, though, here's what you need to know:

Mil/ran Dallai'B/lby was the big winner. getting Best Picture,
Director, Actress, and Supporting Actor. It might very well have
won Best Actor, too, butjamic Foxx happened.

Martin Scorsese once again fell short ofa Best Diiector nod,
having the bad luck to pit his ﬂw'm‘ar against Clint Eastwood’s
dark horse Mil/inn Dollar Baby. He did, however. pick up a Sup-
porting Actress for Cate Blanchett and a number of technical
rewards.

The Incredible; also did well, winning another Best Animab
ed Feature statuette for Pixar, as well its a sound mixing Oscar.
thn will Hollywood learn that Plxar movies aren't successful
just because the animation is done on a computer? The key is
painstaking attention to story and character, and determination
from the top down to get everything right. Case in point: Tb:
Iirrrtdib/M vs. S/Iarﬁ TIl/l.

To speed things along, all the nominees for minor awards were

brought on stage together. After the winner stepped forward, the

lights were turned off on the losers rind they were ushered out.
The even more minor awards were presented from the audience.
Acceptance speeches were given from microphone stands sitting
in the aisle. As host Chris Rock joked in one of his few slam
dunks ofrhc night, ‘Nextycar they ll give out the Oscars in the
parking lot A diive- through Oscar lane. Get an Osclu and u
MeFlnrry and keep it moving."

In an attempt to spice up the night, three of the five Best
Song nominees were performed in part by Beyoneez To be fair,
Beyonce' delivered with poise and style. But it is a little ridieus
lous that Emmy Rossuin, star or I’ll/mum 0/7/13 Opera (and sole
redeeming factor in DnyA/zer 7b/ni7rl‘a-Iv) was on stage to intro-
duce chonce'.

After all, Rossum is a classieally trained opera singer who
sang all her own parts in Pbmzmm. Maybe its just me, but Id
rather see Rossum sing than a third taste of Beyoncc’ “Quick
Change" Knowles.

The practice ofeelebrity standeins for actual performers also
backfired for the actual winning song, TiltMo/argtr/c Di/m'u “Al
Otro Lado dcl Rio“.

Carlos Santana and Antonio Bar-idem: did a passable job of
performing it, but when it won, singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler
delivered a beautifuliand pointedimessage, In the classiest ac-
ceptance of the evening, he sang a few lines from his song the
way it was supposed to be sung, and sat down.

Hillary Swank had a clever little gambit to beat the orchestra
in her acceptanee speech. “You can't do that,"she interrupted as
they tried their best to play her off stage, “I haven't mentioned
Clint yet."

Unfortunately, after Swank ﬁnally got to Clint, she then res
membeted several other people, and with Mr. Eastwood out of
the way, the orchestra wasn’t so forgiving. She ended up turning
what could have been a highlight ofthe night into a blooper.

While Jeremy “comedy Legend" Irons was presenting Best
Live Action Short in one of the aforementioned aisle awards,
a loud bang went off in the theater. “I hope they missed," said
Irons, doing a small part to make the night more fun.

Ovciall, the night was short (under 4 hours!) and amusing
but in need ofsome more ﬁl‘lC’lllnlng, IfABC wants to increase
viewership for the Oscars by having celebrities perform hit songs
instead ofinsufneieutly popular original artists, then go ahead.

But if they’re not going to advertise that race, then there
doesn't seem to be much point. Also, the awardSell aisle are just
a little bit demeaning. I‘ll take the beautyrpttgennt style awards
on stage to keep it short.

But ifyou'rc going to give out the Oscar, at least give the win-
ners the dignity ofstanding on stage.
