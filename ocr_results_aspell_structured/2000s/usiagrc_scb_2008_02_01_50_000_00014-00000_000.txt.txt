Pioneers suffer from injury

Men’s basketball, down two key players, faces a close loss against Lawrence

BvJ/ii GARG

The Grinnell men’s loss to Lawrence during Saturday’s
game was disappointing for fans and team alike. Lawrence won
109406 over the Pioneers after Grinnell failed to tie the game
in the ﬁnal seconds. However, the score doesn’t tell the whole
stor .

(YErinnell was playing without two of its most important
components: Keith Chamberlain '08 and David Arsencault’09.
Chamberlain has been an asset in the paintiblncking shots,
grabbing rebounds and creating openings around the perimeter.
His absence has been visible on the court, with a couple of first-
years ﬁlling in for the senior. Moreover, since Chamberlain was
injured, Grinncll has gone 34, including three losses in ren-
ference. With Chamberlain, Grinnell is 7-1, including several
doublerdoubles for the big man.

“I should be back within another week or two," said Cham-
berlain, "I will deﬁnitely be back for the conference tourna-
merit,"

Arseneault, the Division III lender in assists, sat out against
Lawrence with an ankle sprain. “David is day-to-day"said Aar-

on Epps '11,a ﬁrst-year on the basketball team. ButArseneault
expects to be ready to go this weekend against lllinois College.
Even with the close 1055, Saturday’s game was still a very ims
pressivc performance by the team as a whole.

“ I think oncc we get healthy, we can go on the road and do

some damage," said Chamberlain.”Then we can make a run at
the NCAA's."

There is a neurological disease known as scrapie that can
be found in sheep. This disease causes the animal to rub itself
compulsivcly against rocks in an attempt to scrape on its own
ﬂeece. In rare eases, some have been found to have scraped
their heads so aggressively that they broke through the skull
and scrambled then own brains. 1 enry those sheep.

lust Six months ago the Minnesota Timberwolves traded
away the greatest player in the history or their franchise. And
now. contract talks are ongoing between the Mets and Johan
Santana that Will send the best pitcher in baseball sinct: 2003

trades go
down, and it scems that a majority or the time the team receiv-
ing the package oryoungsters ends up getting the worse end of
the deal. One notable exception to this was the infamous Her
schel “hiker deal that sent ﬁve players and eight draft picks to
the Cowboys in return for the star running back The Cowboys
used the picks to create a dynasty in the '90s,while the Vikings
underutilized Walker
and continued in their
mediocrity. Although.
given recent news sur»
roundrng Walker, rt has
become apparent that
the Vikings thought
they were getting m‘llfr
pie star players in return
for mortgaging their fur
cine.

Like any fan who has just hurl to watch a favorite superstar
leave thiough trade, I feel like lean Van de Vcldc on the 18th
green at carnousrio. sure, not all is lost, but there's that reeling
that things aren't going to get better any time soon and there
really isn't anythrng you can do about in The trade could turn
out to be Barrolo Colon to the Expos, but it's more likely to be
Curt Schilling to the Diamondbacks

considering that the very high end for both majoi leagrre
ready players the Twrns received is a low grade 3rd starter, the
success orthe deal hinges on .r 22 year old with a career minor
league OPS of.735 and an eighteen year old pitcher. But eight
teen year old pitchers have fantastic trackrecerds,don'r they.> I
mean, the always make it to the majors and are solid produc-
ers, right? Right?l

One positive thing
a trade such as this one
can bring ~ no mats
tcr how unheralded the
young players may be
— is hope for the future.
Now, hope is a danger
ous thing. It can drive a
man insane, and given
recent developments, my mental stability will rival that ofBars
retr Robbins during the week ofthe super Bowl. Butwhenevet
a deal brings in a multitude ofyoung talent, it is always fun to
project where your team is going to be in a few years. No mats
ter how bad rr may seem next year or in 2009, you can always
imagine that those prospects in Single and DoublesA will not
only meet, but exceed all expectations, turning your team into a
dynasty in the mold of'805 Oilers.

Untorrunarely, alongside hope comes the realization that
your team wont be contending for possibly years to come, At
least in the Twins’ case, not unless you get a new owner that
is willing to put more of his own money into the team, which
begs the question: why couldift Delmon Youngjust chuck a hat
at Carl Pohlad and kill the old man already?

Also, apparently there is some sort or” big game happcn‘
ing this weekend. I really don’t follow sports too closely, but
I ﬁgure I’ll make a prediction anyway: that team from New
England—38, that team from New York727r

”[Hope] can drive a man insane,
and given retentdevelopmenli,
my menrn/ stab/lily wi/l rival
that ofBarrel Robbins during

a multitude iii young talent, ii
