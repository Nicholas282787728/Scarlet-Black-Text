Classics department
demands Greek system

m'jlhllVIALEWITZ

From binge drinking to random
hookups, many dccm Grinnell as up
propriately ripe with stereotyped colt
lege activities. But Classics majors on
campus cite one important staple as
missing: a Greek system. At a recent
SEPC meeting, representatives from
the mytlrreading, Siren—lusting cle—
partment overwhelmingly decided that
Grinnell's “Going Greek" would not
only improve the quality ofeampus life,
but also significantly enhance the tier
partment’s mission.

But this is not your father’s Greek
system these students have in mind.
Perhaps one could describe it as your
Great Great Great Great Great Great
)1 107Grecian grandfather's system.

”It will be authentic," said Classics
major David Driscoll '09. “Once we
start honoring the gods through our
classical rituals and scholarship, soon
all Grinnellrans will see that we are all
Zeus’ children."

Fellow Classics major Mitchell
Parks ’08 said that the ﬁrst place to start
is with religion, “It's been years since we
last sacriﬁced a heifer to the honor of
the gods," Parks said. “I think our re-
cent interminable winter is punishment
from Demeter because of our lack of
reverence."

The most noticahlc changes in the
proposed system will probably be to the
structure ofcampus society. While clas-
sics majors want to keep Harris Diony—
silrn revels and the traditional Griiinell
appreciation of nudity, campus social
orgaiiwatioii would be changed.

Rather than using majors or level of
seniority as cr “End in labeling students,
campus would he organrecd uito r'our

classes based upon wealth, from lowly
slaves to the valued aristocracy.

The Athenian Constitution will
replace the Student Handbook, while
JudCo and Jornt Board will be replaced
by an assembly chosen by lot from all
student citizens (male nonsslavesi
about 20 percent orthe student body).

Additionally, chariot races and ink
man sacriﬁces would replace Ultimate
Frisbee and other recreational activities
as afternoon fixtures on Mac Field.

The proposed Greek system would
also inﬂuence the college's admission
process. “The Greeks saw SAT scores
as too subjective,”said Driscoll. “What
better way is there to determine a stu—
dent’s aptitude than nude wrestling?"

Only time will tell as to whether
or not the Classics majors will be able
to effectively persuade adminisrrarion
Parks's view that “once you go Greek,
your national rankings will peak."

According to SGA Vice President
ofAcademic Affairs Eric Olson '08, the
movement may face adversity. “After
scratching our heads at the unproduc-
tiveness of Socially Constructed Habi-
tat for Humanity [as inaugurated last
year by the sociology department] we’re
a bit reluctant to fully pursue initiatives
made by members of individual discr
plincs." Olson said.

But while Classics majors plan to
shoot for the stars, they will still be
satisﬁed if adnli strarion will at least
grant rhem a few concessions if their
grandiose plan is to he reicctcd. Said
Parks,“wc’d still be happy irwe are able
[0 bring the great historian Herodotus
as a commencement speaker, or if rhc
administration adopts our proposed
motto change, ‘Persai Gaincisrhc,”
