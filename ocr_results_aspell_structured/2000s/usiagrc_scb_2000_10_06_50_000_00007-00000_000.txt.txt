Mid-50’s Who Can Kick Ass" Wormely also
helped to secure the defense with his wicked
play and sage advice comparing rughy to rais-
ing hogs. Rczssurcd by this analogy, scrumhalt
Grant “Ladybug" McCall ’02, and outside (Cn-

ter Justin “The Fighting cricket" Dieter '03,
helped lead Grinnell past the try line twice.
Grinnell seemed posed to score a third try
with ten minutes left in the match when a
Blackhawk player went to tackle Grifﬁn prop
Denny “Bubble Bee" smith. in the ensuing
maul several Blackhawk players improperly
dived in without binding, landing on Smith’s
ankle. The subsequcnrscreanis and ambulance
hrought play to a halt tor a time, during which
wormely commented that, while he felt bad
for the injured player. the Headhunters had
been engaging in dangerous and illegal play.
He then quoted a Greek political philosopher
saying, “Justice is Slow, Justice is sure."
