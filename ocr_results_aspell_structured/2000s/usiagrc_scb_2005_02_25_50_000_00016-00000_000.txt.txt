Two changes have been made to
Grinnell's financial aid policy, affecting
both international and domestic stus
dents. Grinnelt is changing its admis-
sions policy for international students
away from a “needdolind” admission
policy to what Dean ofAdini ion and
Financial Aid Jim Sumner desciibed
as "ncedssensitive".

Starting in the fall of 2006. inlets
national applicants who can afford to
pay their own way to Gr‘ inell Will
receive a “slight advantage" n the ap-
plication process so that more aid can
be given to needy students, according
to Sumner.

At an open forum on international
student ﬁnancial aid on Feb, 22, Sums
net and Eric Staab, coordinator Oflli’
ternational admissions, explained the
changed system.

“Until now," said Sumner, “inter-
national student admission decisions
have been needsblind, but we have not
had the resources to meet full need”

“We only have met financial need
for 4045 percent of international
students," said Staab. “Everyone who
demonstrates enough need gets a half-
tuition grant. There are a handful of
special scholarships given out each
year, but other than that half-tuition
plus work is the mat."

Foreign students cannot get loans

International student financial
aid goes need-sensitive

Need-based financial aid for domestic students to be calculated more like federal aid

citizen Ca-signing. As a result, many
international students end up work-
ing long hours every week to pay for-
Gi'innell,

Financial aid for current interna»
tional students will not be affected by
this change. By the time the decision
was made, advertising {or the class or
2009 had already been sent out mans
tioning Grinncll’s status as a “need-
hlind" institution, so the changes will
not apply to next

International
students at the F07
rum seemed generally accepting of
the changes. “Ideally, what I’d like to
see is more ﬁnancial aid in general to
international students," said Rohan
Mandelia '05, president of the Inter
national Student Organization (ISO)
and one of the student representatives
on the student-Faculty Committee

“With the restriction placed on the
committee by thc ttustccs, though, this
will address the problem face by most
inteinational students—that there’s
not enough aid."

Despite the shirt away troin a
liccdsblind philosophy for inletlllk
tional students, Stunner said that the
college does not intend to change its
domestic admissions policy,

“1 think that

Grinnell in the
long term will re-
main committed
to both necdsblind
admission [for dos
mestic students]
and meeting the
full need of admits
ted students," he
said.

“It‘s such a
critical part of
the culture of this
place. When you
stop talking about
meeting full uccd,
cgalitatianism suffers." ,

For domestic students, Grannell is
changing the formula that ‘it uses to
calculate nccd. According to surniier,
there are three general ways that cols
leges calculate need.

Some use the CSS Proﬁle, which
has the downside of requiring a large

fee from the student. The most com-
mon choice is the federal FAFSA,
Other colleges devise their own his
stitutional, methodology, usually by
combining parts the Proﬁle and the
FAFSA.

“We're becoming morc dependent
on the FAFSA,“Sumner said,“but not
100 peicent.”Grinnellwil.l continue to
expect, as the federal government does
not, that students will work during
the summer and that nonseustodial
parents Will contribute to their child's
education.

Starting in the fall of 2005, Grin»
ncll will not count primary home
equity against students. “The way it
is now," Sumner said, “you can have
a middle class family in California
with a $700,000 house who only owe
$100,000 on it, and a portion of that
home equity would work against the
student.“

Next year, money that families have
invested in the house that they live in
will not usually be counted against
them,

Also, the college is updating its
expectation of living expenses, These
expenditures, such as books and school
supplies, were revised to account for
inflation, so many students may quali»
fy for small increases in ﬁnancial aid,
