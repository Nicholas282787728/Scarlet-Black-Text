GIMP stages “Hello Again"

Bv AMELIA KOFDRD

Although Katherine Jarvis '08'5 parents
support her theatre endeavors, they will not
be watching her perform in this semester’s
Grinncll Independent Musical Productions
(GIMP) production. “Myparents didn't want
to come," she said. “I told them what it was
about and they were like,
hmm. . .why would you want
to be in a show like that?”

The show is Helloﬂgnin,
a musical about seductionY
sex and relationships, Write
ten in 1994 by Michael John
LaChiusa, it is based on the
turntoftthetcentury play La
Roads by Arthur Schnit—
zler. ln Hel/rz/fgain, as in La
Ranch, 10 characters move
through a chain of seductions as each new
character couples With one character from the
previous scene—the \Nhore with the Soldier,

College Boy, and so on. While La Ronda is set
in turn-of—the-century Vienna, each of Hello
Again’s scenes is set in a ditrerent decade of the
20th century.

Although Hello Again contains on-stagc
seductions, stripteases and straddling, it also
addresses the heavier themes of heartbreak,
inﬁdelity and desperation.
“We’ve been marketing it
sort of as the musical about
sex, but it’s not a complete
romantic comedy,“ said the
rector Laura Marx ’07. “It
has its moments of comedy,
but it also has a lot ofmote
poignant moments,"

Students producing the
show included Marx, stage
manager Anna Cesa '07,
choreographer Nogn Ashkenazi '09, musical
director Ben Kim ’07, costume designer Brock
Webb '09 and lighting designer Saul st. John

Faculty votes

to eliminate

distribution requirements

Bv SARAH MIRK

After months ofplrlnning and years ordise
cussioii, Grinnell’s faculty voted 0V6|Wh€lln’
rngly last Monday, Aprrl 2 to end divisional
distribution requirements for students looking
to double majot or study off-campus. All the
effects of this binding vote are still up in the
air, but many involved believe that the most
immediate and protourrd impact orthc change
will be a reshaping or the student-adviser re-
lationship as greater responsibility may fall on
advisors to ensure students seek a well-rounds
ed education,

Griuncll prides itsclforr its open (or, in re
cent Admissions lingo, “guidcd") curriculum
which allows students to choose their own
classes, as long as they fulfill the requirements
tor their major. However, students have trae
ditionally run into what SGA Vice Piesitlcnt

Micliacl Billups '07 calls “imposing require
mcnts"whcn applying to study abroad, double
major or graduate early.

Bob Grey, Political Science, raised the is
sue of abolishing divisional requirements at a
faculty meeting last year, noting that the [6’
quirements had never actually been approved
by those supposedly in chalgc of the curricu-
lum: the faculty.

Flam that meeting, the college's curricu-
lum committee debated the distribution re-
quilements for a year. The committee, which
is made up of three students, three professors
and Dean of Academic Affairs Jim Swartz,
created three proposals and presented them to
the entire {acuity at the meeting Monday.

The reasoning behind the divisional re-
quirements had been twofold. First, they force

Angela Davis selected as
commencement speaker

Bv MACAELA HOLMES

Angela Davis was once
ﬁled for being a member or
the communist Party, she
was on the FBI’s Ten Most
Wanted List, and she is a
former member of the Black
Panthers. Given her history or
agitation,manysclioolswould
consider Davis a risky choice
as commencement speaker.
Not Grinnell.

“[1 am} really glad that
we picked Davis. She really
reﬂects our population very

member.

social justice is also one that

After two months as a fugi—

captured, convicted, and spent
16 months in prisorr.Attet an

acquitted of the charges.
Now,in her role as Protes-

teaches classes on the intﬁl”
section of race, gender and
class. Davis has taught at eight
dirrerent colleges and univere

focus on the social problems
associated with incarceration.
She is an ardent critic ofboth
the death penalty and racism
in the US criminal justice
system and advocates prison

According to Bly, require

they must have aspirations, be

"Davis carries more charac—

he said. “So we got her."
