er were interrupted when the clusters entire voting system
crashed, according to former Joint Board senator Harry
Krejsa ’10, who is currently advising Election Board.

“When ms was compiling the Pionecrweh rosters for
clusters at the beginning ofthe semester, someone spelled
Smounker with an uppercase ‘s’ in one location and a low
ercasc ‘s' in another location," Krejsa said. “And so when
we the unsuspecting Election Board tried to publish the

first ballot, it caused all of their PioneerWeh privileges to
crash,"

Because or this. the voting in smounker was delayed 24
hours but then proceeded without incident.

Despite rhe technical glitches, Krejsa said the elections
were smooth overall, “Every election has little bumps and
hiccups as far as minor formatting and stuff like that,"
Krcjsa said. “By and large, this was one or the smoothest
elections I’ve ever seen." Voter turnout in each cluster was
henveen so and 60 percent, putting participation at one of
the highest levels in years, according to Krejsa.

said the vegan bar will remain open daily.
There are not currently any plans to further
adjust hours. and Williams said that despite
budgetary constraints, Dining is still hiring.

affect students who rely on the Grill for gctr

given the current state of the economy, this is
