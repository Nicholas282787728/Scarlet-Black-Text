Wert '10. Wett said he wanted to see the Task
Force make changes “so we do not see as many
people going to the hospitil."

Wellness Coordinator Jen Jacobson '95 and
co—chair of the Task Force said that the high
number orhospitalications cannot be accurately
compared to previous years because the college
only has a record orambulance transportations.
not actual hospitalizations. “This task force isn’t
just in response to the increase in hospitalizae
dons, it's taking a step back and asking ‘Is our
policy really working>"’Jacobsen said.

To continue to evaluate the alcohol policy at
Grinnell,]acobseri said she would like to see the
Task Force turned into :r permanent committee.
Some students echoed a similar statement.

“We should do that [review of alcohol pole

icy] constantly." said Jakob Gowell '11, HSC of
Rathje and Rose. “It's a dynamic situation. I'm
not sure it should be changed, but we should be
asking ourselves that question all the time."

According to Formaii, the Task Force meet-
ings have not been much discussion about the
speciﬁcs and regulations of the alcohol policy

"Certainly, we've been hesitant to discuss the
current policy or any changes at all until we get
the community perspective and community ii-rr
pat," said Jacohsen.

Mallory Schaxf’ll, who is not on the come
mittee, said she did not feel threatened by the
Task Force, but could understand why other stu—
dents would be. “I think that if anything serious
were to come about from it, the student body of
Grinnell is highly against any limitations of our
rights." she said. “I feel conﬁdent my peers Will
work against it."

Admissions in Early April

BY]. FRANCIS BUSE

As prospective students and colleges are
changing their approaches to the application
process and financial aid packages, the ofﬁces
of Admissions and Financial Aid at Grinnoll
have expressed a steady, yet cautious, attitude.

As noted' in a letter addressed to t1 \c came
pus by President Russel K Osgood on Feb 1
the College increased its financial aid bud:
got by roughly 15 percent in response to the
economic crisis. Osgood sttessed the schools
pledge to icmain a domestically iitcdeblind
institution, while cutting budgets in almost
all other departments,

“As previously projected, the tentative
budget features cuts for capital projects and
includes a 15 percent increase in ﬁnancial
aid,'j Osgood wrote,

According to Drrector of Student Finan-
cial Aid Arnold Woods, this increase, in the
face ofcuts across the rest ofcampus, has left
the Financial Aid Office healthy and able
to support Students. Furthermore. while the
College has increased the Financial Aid buds
get, Woods said that there has not yet been a
spike in aid,

“Ourpartial aid increase was notclrastic, it
was below the norm or about normal,”Woods
said, adding that the average aid package had
increased three percent, in line with the three
percent increase in tuition.

Woods said that the needrhlrnd policy
and loan cap, in which student loan repay-
ments cannot exceed 32000 a year, would
continue, but likely under stricter review from
the College.

“Everything is subject to review of course,
and until we make our plans for future years,
everything that is on the table now will be re-
viewed again," Woods said, “My hope is that
things will remain as they are,"

Interim Director of Admissions Nancy
Maly ’61 also expressed contentment with
the College’s current admissions policy, “It's
a very good feeling that I don't have to in any

. way consider a student's ability to pay when

I’m giving an admission offer," she said.

colleges with needrbliiid policies around
the country have begun to find ways to dis
corn between those who can likely pay full

tuition and those who cannot.

Several colleges. seeking to both mains
tain the title of “need-blind" and increase
the niunbci of incoming students who can
pay full tuition, were likely this year to rely
on international students and those who ac-
ccpted a position on the utaitelistAcimissions
officers are also able to factor in applicants
addresses and parents' educational levels, in»
formation available on the Common Applr
cation and predictors of an applicants sociOr
economic level.

The percentage of international students
accepted from the applicant pool remained
essentially even according to data provided by
the Ofﬁce of Admissions, and Dean of Ads
missions and Financial Aid Seth Allen said
that Admissions was “counting on going to
the waitlist," a departure from recent years,
Howevei, Allen firmly denied that Gtinnell’s
admissions ofﬁce had employed indirect tats
tics to determine financial need.

“i don’t think that you can call yourself
a needrblind institution if on the margins.
when your making decisions, you take need,
or in this case, noeneed, into account,"Allen
said. “That’s not going to be our strategy this
year—1 think we're firmly committed as an
institution.”

Allen cited the usage of the wait-list as
a protective measure against an over-enroll—
ment similar to 2012. The class onOlZ ens
tcrcd Grinnell with 464 students, an over-en-
rollment of 54 students. This year, Allen said
the school is aiming for 335 new students in
the class of 2013.

Admissions rate for the year ﬁnished at 27
percent, compared to so percent {or the class
of2012 and 41 percent for the class of2011.

“[Last year] put the campus size squarely
above 1,500 students, and ofcourse, the cams
pus plan calls for 1,500 on campus," Allen
said. “So that's actually resulted in seeking a
smaller class this year This makes a lot of
sense to me that we go after a smaller class
this year and be very conservative in our ad
missions process."

However, Allen stressed that it is still too
early to tell predict how the admissions pro,
cess will conclude.
