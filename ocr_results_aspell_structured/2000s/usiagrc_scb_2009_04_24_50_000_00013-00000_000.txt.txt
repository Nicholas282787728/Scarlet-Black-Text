Cuba, our long-lost middle school acquaintance

Ch

Remember that kid from middle
school, the one who annoyed the crap
out of you all the time? I don't mean
to sound like an ass. butI knew one of
those kids back in middle school. He
would always come up to my locker
after fifth period, wanting to borrow
some gum, or rell me about his new cal-
culator (yeah, right) and all the “dopcl”
things he could do with it. I mean,
I msn’t exactly the coolest kid in the
world back then, but I knew enough to
know that being seen with this kid—
let‘s call him Joshﬁnd his calculator
would not bode well for my chances of
hanging our with any ofthc inserowd.

1 never did see Josh mrreh after
avoiding him like the plague in mid-
dle school. We went to the same high
school, which, small as it was, was just
large enough that we could cxist in dirs
fcrent social circles and never sec each

5 how communist Cuba parallels an annoying kid from his early years of schooling

other in four years, 1 was ﬁne with not
seeing him. He didn’t really change
much at all in irigh sehool, except to
graduate from a calculator to a Palm
Pilot and a PowerBook laptop.

But this past winter break, I ran
into Josh in a lcnlly surprising vmy. I got
losr trying to ﬁnd a friend's house, and
when I stopped to ask for directions at
a Bertueei’s, 1 round Josh sitting in a
booth across from a gorgeous woman]
was a little shocked, but he recognized
me, and even ended up driving me over
to my friend's house (whom he also
knew, coincidentally), Made me feel
bad that I had ignored him all those
years. and not given him the time ofday
when I should have.

surprrsinglyenough, America has a
Josh. He's called Cuba,and he’s a lovely
little island nation ofI'thc coast of Flor-
ida, America and Cuba, like Josh and

menr was red and rarher aggressive. We
just got lost, and now we’re realizing
that u lirtle bit of a guide in the area
wouldn’t be such a bad thing.

I’m talking, of'course. about Presir

Cuhailoosenlng travel resrrretions
by allowing Cuban Americans to
visit their
relatives in
Cuba, and
allowing for

It’s not a massive change? Cuba is still

The ultimate goal, at the end of the

politicians, is to ﬁnally omeially reeoga
