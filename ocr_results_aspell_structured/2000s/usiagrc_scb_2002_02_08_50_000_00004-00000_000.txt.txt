Cops, Communes and Cameras

Shorter and more comprehensible movies this weekend, we promise

Jayn: It’s only the third week baek and already I feel
like a total moron. so far, someone named pat the Proiee.
tionist tailed me a bitoh and to top it off, I’ve only seen one
or this week's movies. isn't it grout to be back? Eitherway, 1
hope that these misinformed rants ean somehow help you
to make plans this weekend.

Biadley. Be quiet iayn, youre ruining our mystique.

whioh is all we ve got left. There are already oounter movie
oolumns in the sea.

Training Day

Tagline: The only d1ing more dangerous than the lino
being erossetl, is the oop who will eross it.

Starring: The Hurrioane, a Hamlet. ossortod rappers.

J: For all you Denrol lovers out there. this movie is
going to be worth misting that booty. shaltin' Harris party.
For one otthe few times in his oareer, Dcnzcl is not playing
thestiaightedgod hero. In TmmingDny,
he is Sgt. Alunm Harris. a bad-ass nar-
cotics ofﬁcer who trains rookie naro
lake Hoyt (smart Hawks). From
smoking some I’Cl’elaocd pot
they oonﬁseate to pulling
guns on everyone. Hoyt
gets immediately drawn
into Harris’s rastepaoed,
violent world.

B: This looks like
another buddy/oop
movie. so forgive Jayn
and me for not paying to
see it No doubt Dentels perrotmmee is award.worthy,
but this movie doesn’t appear to have use oomplexitios of
this weekend's other ﬁlms. I retommend Training Day only
to people who are sick or Lenny, Teddy. and Natalie rrom
Mariam:

Jayns dosing thought: in high school, people some—
times mllcd me a natc, and this movie makes me wonder if
that was a bad thing

Together

TaglineIPlot Summary: One house; one revolutionary,
two open straight marriages: three gay people (maybe four):
three children; two carnivores and eightvogetariaris; there's
only one way they're going to make it together.

B:Those oryou hoping to see the outstanding MTV
musiral parody 2gzr/7Ir will be disappointed. Cheesy boy
bands and oomedio conventions are replaced by ABBA and

insightful eommentary on politics and interpersonal relav
tionships.

in 1975 that has all die residents listed above in rho tagline.

Elisabeth and her two kids move into the eommune, ore.
ating personal problems beyond ovoretowding.

J: Despite ﬁgtt/In's large east. none orwrirer/direetor
Lukas Moodysson's eharaeters are shallow. They all have so
much depth and eolot, and elear reasons to live at ngzt/In.
Also. he makes some very insightful statements about the
commune itselrand how eomrnunes, while scemlngly great
at first. beeomo more and more imprsotieal not to
mention eourining as time passes. Kinda like my life in
James Pit.

B. After the rust ﬁve minutes, when two shots other

screen, its olear this is a very unique and bold rilm. lts

very wry yet unsubtle in its lertist presentation. The

Jayns olosing thought: who knew there was
belowetheequator nudity? well, it's probably
similarta thesupposed "sizding lesbian sex some"
in Mitlhorhrnd Drive.

Brad’s big number: was stolen by the eomprea

hensive tagline. Despite that.
cheek out this fresh, runny
ode to the ‘70s.

Memento

Tagline: some memories are best forgotten

starring: A diag queen. the east or Thor/roost.

J: Mmmm opens with a photograph oh man with his
head blown off. And then the photo becomes live and is
played in reverse until the man also is alive, Without une
deistanding why, you've juxrsccn the promise orthe movie,

Meet Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce). After a struggle
with an intruder who raped and killed his wife, he is af-
fected with a shortetetm memory loss. He sari remember
his entire life up until the nlght ofthe attack, but now he
ran only remember the last ten minutes. His memory is
retained through photos with his Polaroid amen orpeoplo
and plaees and self-applied tattoos eovenng his body, whieh
are clues about the identity ofl-lix wife’s killer.

is: This outstanding ﬁlm shows everything that inde-
pendent einema ean be. Made for only $5 million, it has
great performantes from a Wonderful east. stylized oinerna.

the story ends, yet get drawn further and further into it.

Jayn'x ClosingThought: Despite the her that my brain
is rned from last weekend and 1 dream ofcrazy old people
now, I'm still going to see this movie.

Brad's Big Number: 2. rank in some other movie eol.

4 Little Girls

Tagline: Birmingham. 1963. Asinglo :xplosion roeked
a community and awakened a sleeping nation.
