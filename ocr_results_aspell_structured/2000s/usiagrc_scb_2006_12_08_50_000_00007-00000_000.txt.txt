Overtime battle leaves Pioneer women victorious

Women s hoops team gets
back on track with exciting
win after'battling weather
and tough opponents last
weekend in Wisconsin.

at NATE LlNDSEY

After a 3-1 riolIrcorlfercnce start, the
Grillllell Women's basketball team met a cold
and rocky start to the Midwest Conference
season last weekend in Wisconsin.

Dire to inclement weather, the Pioneers
frrst mulch-up oftlreir two game weekend trip
to Wisconsin was postponed. On Friday, the
Pioneers were scheduled to play St. Norbert
College, but Instead played their first confer
ence game against Carroll College Saturday.

'We had initially game planned to play
St. Norbert, their plays and how we would res
spond,"]odie Watkins ’09 said. “When it got
cancelled we had to go back and talk about
Carroll. It was a hard transition."

Instead ofGrInnell’s fresh legs meeting the
seco‘ndrranked team in conference, they met
the top team.

Against Carroll, Hannah Wolf’OB led the
team with 23 points, while Watkins added 11.
Witlljust 10 minutes left in the game Grinnell

hilf ended with Wolf hitting a three pointer
to tie the game at 33 33 The second lialfwas
much the same story, wrtli neither team pulls
ing ahead by more than four points during the
entire 20 minutes.

With 50 seconds to go, Monmouth freshr
men Elise \K’aldorfstolc the ball and ran down
the court foran casy breakaway lay up to put
the Fighting Scots up o9»o7.

VVolfsunk two free throws rn the ensuing
Grinnell possession to tie the game at 69.

Then with 33 seconds left, things got a
littlc crazy.

After the free throws, Wolf again came
up big for the team by intercepting the in»
bound pass. Monmouth players immediately
swarmed her and Coach Hamilton called for
the team's final timeout. Gtinnell successfully
inbounded the hall and held it outside the are
as time dwindled down.

Kolbe then attempted to drive for the po-
tential game-winning shot, but a Monmouth
defender cut offthe lane and forced Kolbe into
tmvclIIIg.

Monmouth inbounded the ball, but Wolf
again came away with a steal. It looked as
though she had a free break away lay-up and
GrinneLl would win, but a questionable no»call
on a possible hacking foul stopped her and
sent the game into overtime,

Despite the back and forth of regulation,

 

 

only trailed Carroll by five, but Carroll's Crye
tal Hoewisch led a 19-9 Carroll run to down
Grinnell, 66-51. Hoewisch ﬁnished with 37
points.

 

overtime was dominated by the Pioneers,who
pulled away by seven wrrh two minutes left.
A few late shots fell in for Monmouth, but

"She couldn't miss," Watkins said, “Even
when we did guard her well she still scored
over its. we had good defense and good en-
etgy, but it's hard to overcome a player who‘s
hot like that,"

The team traveled to De Pore, Wisc. on
Sunday to face the St. Norbert Green Knights.

Senior Captain Emily l<olbe believed the

postponement to Sunday hurt the Pioneers'

chances ofvictory.

It definitely hurt us, Kolhe said. "We
were really looking forward to going into st
Norbert wrth fresh legs. lfwe had played them
the first day, wed have probably shown up with

a better performance."

The Pioneers fell to the Green Knights
82-62, unable to stop their inside post game.
St. Norbert's Center Bianca White scored 26
points,

The Pioneers’ lilck changed at home

points, nine assists and four steals.

Men’s hoops has tough road trip but gets decisive win at home

BYDAN HARDlN

The men's basketball team couldn’t have been happier to
return to the familiar crowd in Darby Gym on Wednesday after
a grueling road trip last weekend.

Grinnell faced both the weather and two tough opponents
in their trip to Wisconsin, resulting in two losses to start coir-
fcrencc play.

"Whenever you go to Wisconsin, you hope to at least split
the games [versus St. Norbert and Carroll]," said coach David
Arseneault. “We had a better chalice to beat St. Norbert, and
you want to play the team you have a better chance against first,
but that couldn't happcn," he said,

The Sr. Norbert game was meant to be played Friday, but
was postponed until Srindaydue to the storm that covered most
of the Midwest in ice and snow.

With the St. Norbert game postponed, Grinnell started the
tripvplaying Carroll College on Saturday, Carroll has bccomc
one of the top teams in the conference, ranked second In the
preseason coaches poll Grinnell played arguably their best bass
ketball of the year, only to fall 136-134 after a late part oi free
throws by Carroll

“That is a little scary torn coach, to play your best and still
come up slrort,"Arscncault said.

One positive of the Carroll game was sophomore guard

Bobby Long breaking out of an trrrlyescrtson shooting slump,
After averaging less than sit points through the first three
games, Long exploded for 27 points, going seven of 10 from
beyond the arc.

Aftera long weekend oftravel and .r tough loss against Cats
roll, Grinnell could not muster enough energy to beat St. NOI’
bert College on Sunday.

Grinnell was outrrebounded 67‘27, partly because they
shotjust 847 from thieizrpoint land.

“I don’t know if it was the travel or the game before, but it
seems like we have a game like this every year, where no one

has any encrgy,"Arscncnulr said after the game, adding that the .

team is fairly small and needs to have fresh legs to compete on
the glass.

In addition to the rebotnrtirng woes, leading scorer John
Grorberg ’09 shot just five for 28 from the field.

“We cannot survive many 5»28 nights from John," coach

'Atscncalllt said. “We need to have a lr2 punch, and he has to

be the one."

Coming off the tough road trip, returning to Dar
on \Vednesdliy to face conference foe Monmouth wa ,
what rirc Pronccrs needed. ln an only milstvwin situ'atron to
. .y in the confcrcnc . e, the men came out witlralot ofen-
crgy and some deadron shooting ftnm three-point range.

The Pioneers took control early in the first half and never
looked back. With the score tied 19719 early on, Grinnell's
shaip shooters zeroed in, scoring 84 points by halftime en route
10a 143-125 wiII.

Gtotberg scored 41 on 1444 from the field (41 pctccnt),
including seven onO (35 percent) from beyond the arc.

Trek Langenhan '07 posted 15 pornts on five ofseven from
three-point land, Mike Schmidt ’08 shot four of eight from
downtown for 12 points, and David Arseneault ’09 added 19
points and ll assists with just four turnovcrs.

Keith Chamberlain ’08 chipped in 19 points on seven of
nine shooting and led the Pioneers wrrh 11 rebounds Doug
Ticus ’07 nabbed frve steals to keep pace with his leaguerle'atlr
rng average of 4.4 per game. »

The Pionecrs went 27767 (40 peycent) from beyond the arc
and forced 31 Monmouth turnovers, neatly doubling Grinnell's
total of 16,

“We knew We had to win, and we came out with a lot of
intensity, Chrmbcrlain said. With the energy of the home
crowd rr is easy to get going

The men's basketball loam hopes for the same home court
advantage tomorrow when they face off against in state nt-al
Simpson College in a nonrconfercnee game at 2 pm. in Darby
Gym.
