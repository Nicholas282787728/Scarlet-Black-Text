Football coach Greg Wallace became head coach
for rlre Pioneers in 1986 and today only two Pioneer
head coaches have longer tenures at their positions.
(Cross country and rr-ack coacires will and Evelyn
Freeman have been with their teams sincc I980.)
VVaUace, who has also coached the men's golf team
Since 1992, led Grlnnell to the 1998 MVVC Title and
the rrrost wins in a single season in school hisrory. The
SUB caught up with Wallace last week, fresh off of
his ream’s had 2004 campaign.

Q. Why Grinmrll? Haw did you
endup hm?

A. I was ar center Collcgc
in Kentucky for 10 years before
I came here, and Center is a very
good academic school. As far as be-
ing a head coach, I was looking for
a school with that kind or repuras
tion, and Grinncll was one of those
schools that appealed to me.

Q. When you got here, did you
plan an :myingfarthe long [Jan]?

A. No,l had no idea it would be this long. At the
time I came, I had two sons that were in the elemerr
tary grades and Grinnell was a great city to raise kids.
My wife works in rhc libraries orall three elementary
schools now, so it was kind ofa nice match for us.

Q. What's changed about the rpm and the Plate
riureyaufiart (arrived?

A. I think one of the big things is rlrat ir is nor
only acceprable to win at Grinnell now, but it's some
thing that we all are striving to do. I’m not sure that
maybe that was the situation when I first came. Butl
think rhar one ofthc things that really catapulted ath—
letically was when the women's basketball team won a
conference championship in the early 905.1thinkthat
there was a change on campus at that time; there were
a lot of differences. The men’s basketball program and
the football team had not won in a number of years
leading into the 90s and that’s not necessarily the case
now.

the scarlet and black

A coach with staying power

Greg Wallace, Grinnell’s football coach, has guided the Pioneers for nearly two decades

Q. What‘s stayed [lye smile?

A. I would say rhe leadership in the athletic de—
partment. I think that Coach Farrchrld is the best per-
son I‘ve ever worked with or worked under as far as
coaching is concerned and she has continued to strivc
ro misc our lcvcl orplay. Hcr leadership has been the
key thing over the long run.

Q. Best I/Jing nbontmm/Jing?
A. I still love to go to practice.

Q. Tougher: thing ahout
clinching?

A. Plobably rhe recruiting
because it's such a rough busi
ness, It's not something where
you can wait for the students
to come to you. We spend hour
upon hour on rhe phone trying
to recruit students here,

. i

Q. Most merrramblzgnmz?
A, The game in 1994 when
we beat coc college. The year
bcrorc rhey had trounced us and
really took it to us They had a running back that set
a national record running against us and we hadnr
beaten Coe is something like 20 years. We came back
and upset them ar Coe, and it was just an unbelreuablc
cxpcricrlcc.

Q. Coaching ir widely rzgarded as one aft/ye mast
rrrassﬁiljahs there Lt. How does one hand/a itfar as [mtg
aryau haoa?

A. Ifyou don’t have an outler, you're in big trouble.
Whether it be ﬁshing, hunting or golﬁng, you have to
have some other enjoyment outside of the coaching
aspect. Otherwise, you’re probably going to burn out.

Q. Haw any game day/superstitions ar ritrmlx?

A Yeah 1 do. I usually wear the same clorhes, the
same shoes, the same slacks, it’s just one of those
things that you gcr in the habit otdoing.

Q. What do yin: think is the role qfﬂmtball ml a tale
leg: ”lupus?

A. I rhink it’s a grcar outlet for a number orins
dividu . I think that after being in the classroom
and dc rug with the rigors otthe academic programs
licrc, l tlrrnk football piovldcs a grear deal or stress
robot for a number or our players. Thor-cs a camai'ar
delic rhar happens among football players that is a
special thing.

Q. W/mt iryaur take on your 6-4Stamll? War it a rue
cm?

A. i think it was a great season for us.You always
go into a season hoping for the best and you would
like ro play for the championship. We knew that we
maybe weren’t quite that good, but we felt we had a
good nucleus of a team coming into the season. We
had some seniors with injuries and we were forced
to make some changes but I think with the coaching
staff that we had and the senior leadership, we were
able to rebound and get the train on the right tracks.
It was a very enjoyable season to coach, from the very
first practice all the way to the last.

Q. Wlmt about next year?,..lotr ofsem'ar 5/1051 to

fur.

A. That’s a huge void. we've gor to recruit some
great ralcnr going inro next year and they need to be
in the skill positions. We have an allsconrerencc type
quarterback coming back [Sean Pfalzer ‘07] but ifhe
doesn't have anyone to block for him or catch to ball,
it would be tough to be an all-conference player agai .
on the defensive side, we return a very good nucleus,
VVc’vc got to ﬁll some slots, but we made some res
ally great strides on the defensive side of the football
down the stretch and it‘s going to help carry us over
into next year.

Q. What doyau want tr: do when you 'ac (lane coat/r-
rug?

A.l guess I don’t want to think about it. I still
cnioy coaching so much right now char 1 feel like I'm
kind of in Withdrawals once the season's over when it
gets to be 4:30 in the afternoon.

Wallace’s
mark

Since Greg Wallace
became head coach of the
Grinnell football program,
Bill Partells has coached
four teams in the NFL, the
nation has been through
five presidential elections,
and, starting next year, the
majority or Wallace's ia-
cruits will have been born.
A look at Wallace's record
with Grinnell:

1985:

How many times has
Grinnell gone undefeat-
ed in school history?
Turns out, only four: the
10»01998 campaign, a
7-0-1 season in 1952,
an 8-0 mark in 1917,
and, of course, Grinnell’s
famous 170 season in
1889.
