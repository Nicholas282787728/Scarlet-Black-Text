paign of “opposed [viewpoints] Foiced both or us to earenrlly eonsrder
what we were pushing for," said Allan.

The presidential campaign mckled controversial issues head— on, in
eluding tuition and the funire ofolrecampus, eollegoowned housing. Jes»
sica Enns '04 pushed an agenda ofa tuition guarantee and huilding new
occo houses. Allan pushed hard for continurng
advocacy for increasing merit hased aid in the same
vein es eurrenr presidentAleiandro Oyanahal '04,

Allan also aurhored an occo proposal pre.

Her proposal provide» for the ﬁrsrsrops towards rcno
vating a huilding in town to create independent,
apartment-style living with the support orthe RLC
system. The proposal, she said. was “a real rest or
whether SGA could be effective at higher levels of
administration," and encouraged her rostayinvolved
in student government. -

Theseeond round orllyerrng in the presidentral
race was especially in.depth in its examination and
explanation orseveral key issues. Allan says she won't forget her platform
now that she's elected. “I’m also responsible for the things that I said and
the things (hit! I wrote," she said, “we knew that [the winner] had to be
held accountable."

“The campargn helped to really hring up some serious issues," agreed
Devan Mchimhan '04. Mchnahan won his incumbent race for the
position oFVioe President/ President of Academic Affaiis.

Despite similar issues. the VP/I’AA election had a less decisive victory.

Both agreed that this year's elections got students to odueare them»
selves ahour campus issues

Allan emphasized the importance or keeping me level of awareness
high as the new adminisrrarion prepares to take ever “I don't Want stue
dents to stop having a vested Interest." she said. “I would prefer that open»
ness.

In hopes of keeping awareness high, Allan plans on hosting weekly
open forums to meet wirh students and student groups. She envisions her
forums es a rune to sit down and discuss smdenr issues as well as to keep
srudenrs informed ahour what is happening in son.

An uninformed srudent hody was an especially fruslmnng factor in
rhe Vice Presidential raoe. “Many of [the issues raised] are broad things
oonide of my purview," said Mecranahan, “I’m
willing so spearhead some or these errorrs, hut rt
rakes a eoneerred from from the student body."

Creating a more open SGA will he a key goal
in the Allani McGi-dmllan administration. "People
are rnrercsred," said Allan, “hut how misinformed
people are... that is a failure ofSGA."

The two will also focus on creating a more in-
elusive vision ofscn. “The most Important thrng
for me would he dispelling this assumption oftl-iis
as an oldeboys eluh," Mecranahan said.

Allan, whose campaign attacked the idea of
SGA as a resume entry or training ground for in.
rure politicians, echoed the sentiment. “That idea
is just absurd," she said. “[1] really want to move out ofthc realm orweird
rules and politics into a realm oraetion,"

ovenrll, the nvo insiders have the same goals for making ehariges rn

While the Allan/ Mccranahan adminrsrration might seem to he a

“people don't reel shut out ofSGA as an old boys' cltrh,"

The issues that this familiar administration will rad» reﬂect the prion.

Making the
case for war

The Students for international
Democracy see themselves as a
moral minority on a pacifist campus

by Michael Andersen

The rrrne ﬁlsteymrs in the Forum Coifcehousespenta
lot ofrirne looking over theirshoulders at the crowd in the
South Lounge.

“Let's see who’s going to this meeting," said one. walks
ing ever to the window. After a few seconds he returned to
his chair. “Nohedy I know."

The meeting that had drawn this crowd to the South
lounge was actually a talk by activist nuns about theiryears
protestingrhe school of the Americas. For daesrnaller group
in til: coffeehouse, though, the identity of this Crowd was
as obvious as the large cardboard box labeled “fold a crane
For peace" at the front ofrhe room and the bandana en Eli
Zigas ‘oo's head. These people were against the war. These
people were the
majority.

The mem-
bers of students
for International
D e m o e r a c y
(SID) are fairly
cereain that win-
ning support for
war in Iraq will
not be easy as
Grinnell. But
though the: belief colored all their eonversatrons at Lhcir
ﬁrst puhiieired meeting last week, it also seemed to imply
that everyone who showed up that cveningAight young
men andone young woman—relrsrrongly about rhe cause.

“War in Iraq is a good and moral acts” said Ben Jacobs
'05, who organized the group early this semester “Saddam
Hussein is a totalitarian dictatorwho has slaughtered hun-
dreds orthousands ofhis own people and would like norhe
trig more than to wreak havoc and destruction throughout
the Middle Easr through weapons of mass derruerion."

This war, in Iacohs’s view, would he humanitarian: far
from a cyniatl war for oil, or even an act shelf-defense, it
would carry on an “old-fashioned liberal" tradition of“mak»
ing the world safe for democracy."

Such language may he atypital among prorwatoigani-
aarrons in die US. But rhen, its members say, SID is a
generally atypical otganlution, horh in the diversity ofits
membership and in its ability to avoid what memhers see
as the close»mindednc§s of some other Grinnell activist
groups.

Jacobs wears button-down shins and (casually and with
apparentease) searrers hrs conversations wirh mediumesi‘lsed
htstoriml and politierl nemes like RohertTart, vaelav Havel
and David Duke. He thinks that antiwar aerivrsts have been
listening so the wrong people. Almost all Iraqis, he he.
lieve, strongly favor an American invasion.

“It's probably safe to assume shes the Iraqi people know
what's good for them hotter rhan the Grinnell srudenr
hody," he said.

“Farcept us," replied Avi Pogel ‘06.

“Butwe're listening to the Iraqi people,” said laeohs

Not all SID members feel the same way about the war
Pogel, who wears a goaree and rolls his own cigarettes, isn't
optimistic about the likelihood orhringing stahle democ»
rarey to lraq. The region, he explained. has suffered from
totalitarianism since the firs: caliphate in the seventh cen-
rury C13,, and the us won't be able to heal those stars
overnight. Regardless, he says, Arneriotn intervention in
[Iraq wrll he the host way to promote secular democracy in
the Asah world
