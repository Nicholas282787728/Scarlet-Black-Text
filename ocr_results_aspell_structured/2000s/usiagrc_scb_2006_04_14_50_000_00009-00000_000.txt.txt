Running up America’s tab

One day, citizens will have to pay for Bush’s wacky spending habits and it will not be pretty

I was eating a ehimichanga when the phone
rang.
“Hello?"

“Mr. Pitzer, this is Donald from Visa Credit
Card Service."

“Yes?"

“Our records indicate that you’ve surpassed your
credit limit."

“Uhsoh.”

“You need to put a check in the mail as soon as
possible, sir. "

“Uh, could you just extend my line ofcredit?"

“No sir, you have exceeded youi credit allow-
ance."

“But going into debris the American way Cons
gross just raised the US. deﬁcit cap to 39 trillion.
They just did it, slapped each other on the backs and
went for steaks. Can‘t you do that for me>"

“No, sir, you’ve maxed out
your card."

“Donald, do you hate free-
dom?"

“Have a good day, sir"

moth ﬂew out.

Boy, I’ve really done it this
time. Nevertheless, I decided to tackle the problem
head on. I did what any responsible American would
do. 1 rolled up my sleeves, tugged at my boot straps
and went straight home for a nap.The next morning,‘
I called the debt professionals.

“White House, how mayl help you?"

“ch,1 read in the paper rhat congress has raised
the US debt limit four times in the last five years.
How can I do that?”

“Why don’t you just apply for another credit
card?"

“Won’t thatjust plunge me deeper in debt?

“Sure, but it will cover your butt for a while."

“That doesn't sound like a wise longererm solue

Concerned, I turned to my computer and con»

offour minutes. I learned that since 2001,while I've

I just frittered awayvaeorge Dubya Bush has in»
creased the national debt from $5.7 trillion to $8.3
trillion That equates to 2,093 Statues of Liberty
constructed of pure gold.
Now, that’s some bling.
And the interest on that
loan? About 52.4 billion
dollars a day. Other than
a few college presidents,
who’s got money like that
lying around?

Of course, much of the borrowed cash has gone
for the llaqi invasion. A l'ecentAssociated Press poll,
however, indicates that 63 percent
of Americans disagree about the
way George Bush is handling rhe
war.

The ﬁnding suggests that the
majority of the country has a bit
ofbuyer's remorse and that the re-
maining 37 percent of Americans
may be missing major porrions of
their brains,

Despite the devastation, the tragic loss of life and
the dwindling public support. Dubya clings like a
barnaclc to the mantra that all is well. He shoots
us a smile, gives us the thumbs up and then spends
money like a drunken cowboy on a samrday night.
A Pollyanna attitude is rarely awise srrntcg Just ask

Frugality is not popular in America. As a nation
we have about as much selrseonrrol as a oneeeyed
dog in a butcher shop. In fact, as consumers we spent
more money than we earned last year, an event that
hasn't occurred since 1933. But if we, as a nation,
continue racking up debt at the current rate, there
will be a day ofreekoning.

Although unpopular,
we must retire the tax cuts,
begin to trim some popur
lar domestic programs
and investigate ways of
attenuating the spiraling
cost of the military. In the

rationed petroleum and food and hid paper and

most pressing issue facing the country. But, it's inter

Back when Bush #1 was in office, everyone
was screaming about it, We even had a squirrelly,
