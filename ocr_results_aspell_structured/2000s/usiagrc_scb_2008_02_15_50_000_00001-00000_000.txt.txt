This year's err—campus study application process has
brought both students and Off~Carnpus Study staff surprise
and trustnition atter 52 stucients applred tor only 35 spots in
the Grirrnellrranorrdon progrilm.This means that, for the first
time since the 1980s, students will be rejected,

Some snldcuts felt the OffrCarnpus Shady Ofﬁce should
have planned better for the amount otapplicnnts

But Richard Bright, director of (lit: Ofﬁce of Off-Campus
study, said that his office had no reason to cxpcct such a sig-
nlﬂcant increase in the applicart .“People have asked,‘V\/:t:n'l
there a lot otpeople at .
information sessions
last fall? This wasn't a
tip oft?” said Bright.
"No, it wasn't, because
there are always a
lot of people at these
meetings.”

that part of the rear
son for such a large
number orapplieauts this year was the ivay the program was
advertised which, he said, “implied that everyone was going to
get in," Many students were upset by this apparent discrepancy
between the programs portrayal and the current reality or the
application process.

Brightsaid that all qualiﬁed applicants were accepted in the
past but that past years are not necessarily indicative oi‘t‘uture
ones. Student expectations were, according to Bright, “assrrmpr
tlons based on past experience and living memory."

The program also includes an overburdened internship
program. Thirty-nine students applied for 15 internships In
response, the program “squeezed out" two new internship op-

Every three to tour years, the trustees consider
whether to increase the percentage ot the endow-

lege spends tour percent otthe endowments valrrc per
year, a decrease or.s percent from 2005 levels. Three
years later, the trustees have begun to consider future
endowment spending.

This year, the trustees
have some political pressure
to consrder. In a lanu y
