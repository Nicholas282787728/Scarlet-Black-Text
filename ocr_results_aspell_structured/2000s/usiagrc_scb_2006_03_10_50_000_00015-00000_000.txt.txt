Letters» to the Editor

We all can do better

Over the past four years I
have valued the SS]? for the
coverage it gives to student
campaigns on various top-
ics. Projects I have worlccd
on have beneﬁted from this
welcome publicrty. Similarly,
the advent of staff editorials
has done quite a bit to Pm,
voke discussion on campus
and I am glad that they have
made a comeback. However,
last week's
editorial,
“ S tu d e n t
p r o r e s t
weak," was
just too
much.

W h o
is the S53
to chide Grinnell students for
not discussing the specifrcs of
their arrest to the paper folr
lowing a protest—especially
after these students have been
given legal advice not to talk
about their legal proceedings?

' Were the Sal? in trouble, I
sincerely doubt that it would
go ayinst the- legal advice it
received. Why then should
the editorial board expect
more of other students? Des
ciding not to talk to the me—
dia is not an example ofﬂnot
standing up for [your] cause."
It's an example of rcsponsibil
ity and heeding the advice of

students to lash

What troubles me more
about the S88 editorial
board sclt-righreously taking
students to task for weak Pm,
test, however, is that the S38
is in no position to sit on a
high horse. I will be the first
to admit thatI,and most othr
er students on this campus,
could do more to make the
world a better place. And that
includes the
588

e d i t o r i a l
argues that
the protest
Victor
rias Secret
in Des
Moines seems to be ”the
only protest we are willing to
trouble ourselves with.” Per-
haps if the S83 did nor use
so much column space prints
ing a full page ad from Cocar

raking
that the 5&8 is

'Cola defending its human

rights record, the paper might
have found a way to give more
than seven-line coverage to
Luis Cardona, the union
member from Colombia who
discussed Coke's involvement
in his country. Cardona’s visit
was part of the student Latin
American Solidarity Group's
campaign to boycott Coke.
Considering that the de-

bate over the Coke boycott
was headli news last see
mester, lim ng reporting of
Cardona’s visit to the “Shorts
hand"scction ofrhe paper this
semester puts the SM? in no
position to chide others for
not protesting enough. Simi—
larly, while the Des Moines
Register found President
Osgood’s $500,000 salary to
be front page news on Feb.
19, the S88 did a disservice
to the campus community,
especially the first-year stu-
dents, by making no menrion
of the article and the issues of
economic equity it raises. It
seems that it is not only stu-
dents in legal trouble who are
keeping quiet.

point is not to bash
the SUB. Instead, I’m trying
to point out that we can all
do better. More advocacy—
whether in the form of pro-
test, newspaper coverage, or
other meansiis something I
would love to see on campus
and in the country as awholc.
Each ofus could do more.

If the editorial board rec-
ognized rhat, perhaps rhea
they would begin ro serve the
campus community by sup—
porting fellow student activ-
ists rather than patronizing
their peers.

Editorial wrong, activism strong

We are writing in response to the March
3 8558 staff editorial which criticized student
protestors for declining to speak with Sﬂﬂ?

March to protest the ongoing war in Iraq; stu-
dents have begun working with immigrants
rights activists in Marshalltown and student

reporters regarding their
arrest at a Victoria‘s Se-
cret demonstration in Des
Moines.The editorial imr
plied that the protestors’
actions show that student
activism at Grinncll is me

We were disappointed [hat [he

attic/e fol/ed to give due respeci lo
the hard work and commitment
many Grinne/iiahs deditale i0

involvement in the Prison
Writers’ Workshop contin-
ues to grow.

Furthermore, we feel
that the comparison be-
tween the FTP protesters
and librarian Chris Gaunt's

perficial and characterized
by a lack of commitment
to serious causes.

We wcre disappointed
that the article failed to give due respect to the
hard workand commitmentinany Grinnellians
dedicate to social activism, even when their ac
tions do not result in dramatic arrests.

To cite just a few examples, during this
semester alone, students have formed a new
group to raise awareness about the genocide
in Darfur; record numbers of students and
faculty have participated in the weekly Peace

sot/oi atiivism

extraordinary decision to

serve time as a prisoner of

conscience was inapproprir
ate and misleading.

The SUE should not use the forum of the
staff editorial as a pulpit from which to anony-
mously criticize the weU-intcntioncd efforts of
student activists who are under no obligation
to speak ro the soils. Grinnell’s long nnd drss
tinguished tradition of social commitment is
alive and well. The S55)? should he an advo-
cate, nor an adversary, for campus activism,

I believe your most ,5,
cent staff editorial to be
inappropriate and unneces-
sarily judgmental.

As an active participant
in both events menu'oned in
your most recent staffedito»
rial (the SOA/WHINSEC
protest as well as the Vie
toria‘s Secret protest), I can
state with conviction that in
both cases I was privileged
to act alongside activists
wholeheartedly committed
to their respective causes.

I confess I do not unr
dersrand your decision to
demean the protesters in
question or your disgust at
their choice to “heed the
advice of their lawyer and
decline to speak to the pa‘
per."

It seems to me that your
foremost objective is a per-
sonal attack on the four ace
tivists.

The fncr that they chose
not to provide you with an
interview is no cause runs
ning editorials with inac'
curacies. The protest, for
example, was NOT sauce

_ tioned by FTP.

Your editorial implies
that the legal issues are a
simple annoyance and that
only good can stem from
giving the soils a play-by-
play account. I beg to dife
fer. The legal proceedings
are still in progress and will
likely continue for quite
some time. I do not believe
the protesters chose silence
because they are embar-
mssed or selﬁsh, as you im-

plied rn the editorial

ramp... yours
Criticism
bombastic

Instead, they are being
reasonable in recognizing
that increased legal worries or
the potential “threat to grad
school applications" are not
worth an immediate story in
the college paper.

This decision bears no re-
lation to their commitment to
environmental sustainability.

If and when the protests
ers feel they can safely further
their cause by speaking wirh
press outlets, I am confident
they will do so.

I am also very troubled by
your implied assertion that
for a protest to be considered
anything more than “an after-
noon outing to a local mail" it
must end in arrest followed by
public notiﬁcation.

This technique is indeed
one way, and often a very
effective way, to promote a
cause. But it is by no means
the only way.

Letter-writing campaigns,
boycotts, posters, petitions,
public demonstrations, fo-
rums, and most certainly, civil
disobedience, are all effec-
tive ways to encourage social
change and need to be ac-
knowledged as such.

Those who partake in
active civil disobedience are,
as you indicate, to be com-
mended for their dedication
to their cause. Chris Gaunt
has my respect and admira—
tion for her advocacy. Still,
no choice, no matter how well
thought out and wellrintenr
u‘oned, is without negative
consequences.

While going to jail cer»
tuinly draws attention, it

prohibits a protester from
working on their chosen
campaign and is therefore
limiting. This is why it is
so important for activists to
employ numerous and vats
ied methods.

None of the protesters
in Des Moines had any in»
tention of getting arrested;
ironically, we took special
precautions 5U as not to be.

We intended to spend
an afternoon informing
people about the environ-
mentally desiructive prac»
tices ofVietoria’s Secret.

Although the day ul-
timately took an unfore-
seen turn {or the worse,
we nonetheless accom»
plishcd our intended tasle
1 am proud of this success
and take oﬂ'ense at having
our work referred to as an
“empty ritual."

In short, none of the
protesters “sacriﬁced their
cause.” Your editorial was
both uninformed and inapr
propriately accusatory. Still,
it is comforting to know
that the SEE is willing to
run a story to “call attention
to the cause of old-growth
wood." Please do.

1 and many others would
be thrilled to discuss why
we are so committed to this
cause and would welcome
the opportunity to raise
awareness on campus.

What is not welcome
is an unnecessarily caustic
denunciation of students
invoking their right to pri—

What is journalism? Is
it the practice of not getting
a story and then making exr

anonymity and self-righ-
tcousncss>

I never thought so, at least
until I read “Student pio-
tcst weak“ last week. I have
never been more rights-t, or-
more ashamed, that I attend
Grinncll, and not because, as
you rcporr “in afternoon out-
ing to r local mall is rho only
protest that we aic willing to

trouble ourselves with," but
because of the article itself,
and its author.

Plainly, l’m usharncd’thur
I go to a school where the
newspaper stufffccls it’s their
right to dictate which deci-
sions ale the right dcci. ns
foi invonc but themselves.

The majority or Grinncll
students decided to attend
here because rhey did lio/
\vant authority figures rolling

the comet coiiises ofacliou.

That' is the basic precept
ofsclf governance, and it of.

And more im poi tantly, we

Another View of Turkey

I enjoyed reading Lauren McFarlms Cole
umn last week and I found much of it stunt

ningly accurate. However, being a “nationalist"

Turk,1 must respond.

I would describe the order in Turkey as an
interestingly systematic chaos. Everything does
seem to be in a complete chaos but somehow
many things work out with such random syn-
chrony.

There are many rcrsons whnr rltc statc
controls the directorate of religion, the most
important of which is, after the caliphatc was
removed, scculuri u had to be preserved at all
costs ind kccpiug thc director-ire oftcligion in
chock not i vitrl part of the plan. It makes a
lot ofscnse considciing 99 percent of’l‘uikcy
is Muslim,

MCF his last commcut about Turkey bee
ing a nation that has not quite found its place in
tlic world is siartlmgl cuiute.

Turkey has problems placing itself in the
modern poliric and social scene due to its gCOr
political importance. We are not yet fully do

velopcd as a whole nation, though the scenery
in Istanbul may lead someone to other conclu—
sions, and yet we occupy probably the most
critical area, right between Eastern Europe and
the Middle East,

Being r nation of 78 million and having a
considerably srrong army. Turkey is a solid cans
didate for having a word in any international
organization it is a member. It iequires, there-
fore, that other countries think carefully before
including Turkey in rheir organizrtions, for
Turkey. when accepted as r member, immedr
ately assumes a leadership position.

Since the Turkisli people have playcd the
mic ofa reigning empire for a long pcriod of
time. it is hard for the culture to he ii face in the
crowd in the modem world

Not to mention the fact that many Europe
brscd inrcrnnnonnl organizations rucrubcrs'
poptrlrrions .uc dominantly Chrrsnrn tnd rlrrs
has led mailv columnists to ctll such organizi-
tlons as “Christiin club in their \vritinrvs
