A bank designed by one ofAmerica's most
famous architects, Louis H. Sullivan, stands in
downtOWn Algona, IA. With its “jeweltbox”
design, it is a marvel of prairie-style alchltec»
ture. But I am not here to visit this American
masterpiece. 1 am here to gawk at a snack tac-
tory accident. Right off Highway 18, .n the
dimlydit conﬁnes of Sister Sarah's Bar and
Grill, on a satin cushion, atop a handeblown,
vibrant orange glass stand, sits the World’s
Largest Cheeto. Peering into the case, 1
ghmpse what looks like a shiny, dark orange
chicken nugget. I’m mesmerized.

Three and a halfhouts before I behold the
World’s Largest Cheeto, I prepare my Googlc
directions and pack up the minivan. It's a long
road to Algona, and several hours into my
journey,l stop for gas and pick up a small 99
cent bag of Cheetos. This is my lunch, and I
eat the whole bag pretty fast. I examine the
from ofthe empty bag, and for a"dangerous1y
cheesy" snack, Chester Cheetah appears quite
safety conscious, wearing a helmet and knee
pads, pushing a skateboard, Looking closer
at Chester,l see his helmet strap is recklessly
unfastened: there‘s a danger.

1 mm over the bag and quickly realize I’ve
just eaten three servings and halfthe total fat of
my recommended daily allowance, and over a
third ofthe sodium. A salty, oily, orange pow-
der coats my ﬁngers, no matter how ﬁercely I
rub them on my pants, making driving alone

in blustery winter that much more exciting.
Just as cars in from of me skid through a layer
of dirty wet snow on the highway, my ﬁngers
shde with sticky “seasoning accumulation“
along the steering wheclt

FritoeLay’s Cheetos Development Manag-
er I<evin Cogan cites “seasoning accumulation"
as the tactoty phenomenon that produced the
World’s Largest Cheeto. He theorizes that a
buildup ct cheese seasoning plopped out ofa
machine in a big blob and passed by inspev
tors. Thus, that same adhesive Cheeto quality
that stains your fingers with orange powder
created the World's Largest Cheeto.

Yes,1 did my research for this expedition.
This giant Cheeto was discovered in Hawaii
in 2003 by Naval Petty Ofﬁcer Mike Evans,
According to the legend (Wikipedia), Evans
poured a bag of Cheetos into a bowl for his
young son, and was at ﬁrst repulsed to find the
huge glob of fried cornmeal and cheese scar
soning. He picked it up and starred for the
trash, but before he tossed it, he thought, as
so many brilliant Americans have: what ifl
can sell this thing on eBay? Soon after Ewms
posted the Cheeto on the auction website, an
international frenzy over the pop culture icon
got our ofhand: people sewed World's Large
est Cheeto puppet spinotts, printed World’s
Largest Cheeto teshirts and placed joke bids
on eBay of up to one million dollars. eBay had
to cancel the auction.

Ofﬁcer Evans eventually donated the

Cheeto to the town ofAlgona, on the reccomt
mcndation of an Algona local radio D}, who
saw the Cheeto's potential to draw tourists and
raise money for charity,

1 spot Sister Sarah’s adjacent to highway
18. Upon enteringl explain why I’ve come. A
server in black pants and a tux shirt says injest,
“There‘s a journalist here to view the World's
Largest Cheeto."Then, she directs me_to the
bar area of the big establishment. From be—
neath the bar, she pulls out a giant cardboard
novelty check for 31,000 from Frito-Lay lr's
signed by one “Chester A. Cheeto." “That
Cheeto sure has raised a lot of money,” says the
server appreciativciy. From fundraising events
like the Cheeto-themed auctions Sister Sarah’s
holds annually, theWorld's Largest Cheeto has
raised between seven and eight thousand dol—
lars for the Kossuth County food hank.While
inﬂating the signiﬁcance of a snack factory abs
normality seems both absurd and in bad taste.
the Checto's role in Algona as a catalyst for
community engagement is charming.

I feared that taking part in Algona's Chee-
to tourism would be dangerously cheesy l
envisioned tacky, bright orange FriroeLay and
Cheeto novelty souvenirs and decorations all
over, and people eating things like Cheetot
breaded cheese sticks and cliili-n-Cheetos.
But I’m astonished to see the Cheeto itselfis
housed in an elegant display atop an antique
ﬁreplace mantle supported by ornately carved
walnut columns.The World's Largest Cheeto

has been shellacked for preservation. The vi-
brant orange infused into its handehlown glass
stand sets the display aglow within this room
that evokes a roaringttwenties gentleman’s
club. I stand in front of a bar with delicate
1y carved wood and polished brass below a
pressedttin ceiling.

People nosh on things like walnut encrust-
ed walleye and Caesar saladThere are no sous
venir T-shirts, trucker hats, or kitschy Cheeto
things on the wall—the decor is a slightly
classier Appleby's. This is much more sophise
ticated than I expected. Although, I suppose,
that’s not saying a lot.
