J: This is the kind ordesperately awful movie that

depressingly pathetic. it is a movie with its audience of

Finals Week Films
Monday: Possession (PG-13)

B: Writer/Director Neil LaBiire, at BYU graduate, is
known for his dark comedies, This ﬁlm, however, is a rot
rnance about two poetry researchers, Aaron Erskhnrl and
Gwyneth Paltrow (sporting a British accent). Their study
oftwo Victorian poets (Jeremy Northam and Jenniferlahle)

dovetails with their own growing relationship.

I: IFhal-idlcd correctly, the material sounds incredihle.
While ihaven't seen it, i won't shy away from recommend.
ing it.

B: I'm getting paid to watch this movie twin. so I hope
you’re right, Jeremy, otherwise, watching Gwyneth for that
long will just be painful.

1; Actually Brad, I can think ofvery few things kn pain»
rui than watching Gwyneth for that long.

Tuesday: Dagtown & Z-Bays (PG-13)

E: Here’s a gripping documentary that covers one of
the pressing issues o£our time: the rise ofskateboarding.
This looks like a Icgitmate “extreme sports” movie. Sorry,
Bin: CnLt/J. Stacy Petalta, one orthc pioneers ofthe skate.
boarding culture and industry, takes a fond look back at
the rise of the Zephyr team. coming straight out of
“Dogrown” (Venice, CA) in 1975, the Zephyrs aggressive
style with origins in surﬁng gave skateboarding a second
wind. This movie looks fast and loud. and should be a
great diversion between attended sessions or Torry How/r}

Wednesday: One Hour Photo (R)

J: Far from a perfect movie, One Hour Photo provides
an hour and a Half of quality entertainment. The
atmospheres oppressively sterile, to great enter, the solid
performance by Robin Williams isytt another credit to his
cvcr-cxpandiirg acting aisiiiry, and Connie Nielson, a mi»
ented and versatile actor herself, is gorgeont. OHP is yet
another sufferer of “bookend syndrome," telling the story
in a long contrived hashhack, but the underlying creepi»

iiess and restraint of the ﬁlmmakmg allows for a decent
balance,
