Letters to
the Editor

Hello.

I graduated from Grinnell
in 1997. I am writing in re—
sponse to the recent opinion
article uGrinnellians Have
Diinkiiig ri-obieiiis.” When i
was at Grinnell I was a “co»
chair” oi'the Health Commit-
tee and helped to plan “Alco—
hol Awareness" week. My fa,
vorite aspecr ofthis week was
a poster picruring a bottle of
beer with a wilting neck. I
stire hope those posters are
still around.

I also fell somewhere be
tween the “O-what—the»hell”
and uO—ehampion drinker,"
depending on the semester. I
drank before I gor to
Grinnell. I drink now, as a
graduate student at a fairly
rigorous university in a rigor»
ous program. I had some

Han/DY! IT's (item To

great times at Grinnell and a
lot of them involved drinkr
ing, Self governance at its
best.

It Grinnellians haven’t
thought about drinking and
its Consequences, how can
they write a paper on Canar
dian peanut pickers that lost
their homes in a tragic mud
slide? I just wanted all those
people in the last two diinlt—
ing categories to know that
there is hope. You too can
come to the Yale graduate
program. You can even stay
in my apartment {Oi a while,
especially if you bring some
beer.

There is not much hope
for the ﬁrst category« you
guys can look Forward to life
at a series ofeonsulting ﬁrms
trying to solve problems

like how to get homeless
peoplerto spend their spare
change on Starbucks specialty
drinks and endless weekends
flipping through mail order
fruit catalogs.

My point is: live now be-
cause the real world will kick
your ass. I learned the hard
way. No matter how many
deserted gyms I wander into,
not ONE serves me free beet
and orange soda.

Well, drink one for me.

I’.S. Cynthiai As much as

I love sarcasm, your attiele
was Just a little bit too sat-
Cilsiic, although your second
paragraph had me fooled.

Also, I never saw a single
person zit Grinncll DRIVE
after drinking — not to say it
NEVER happened, but since
leaving I have been shocked
to ﬁnd that almost all of the
drinkers I know drive. That
is wiiai is TRULY scary.

Take it easy,

EA.
