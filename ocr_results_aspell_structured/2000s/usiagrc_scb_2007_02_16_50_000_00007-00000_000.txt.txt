Old and new images of Italy

av MERRICK MEVERS

Giovanni Nsyyidys Piranesi knew how rough rhc creative
life could be. Despite his enormous talent, he was unable to
find work as an architect and turned to etchings and engravings
as fallback option.

Two hundred and sixty years later, Judith Barrett ’07 also
knows that the creative life is a competitive one. “In the mu-
seum ﬁeld, experience is everything," she said. But Barrett
and nine other Grinnell students In the Art department’s EXe
hibition Seminar gained some of that valuable experience last
semester, when they curated an exhibit showcasing Piranesi’s
eighteenth-century prints of Roman architecture Piranesi’s
story also ends happily, as he became known as the greatest
traditional printmaker of architectural monuments.

This is the tenth time in 20 years this course has been of-
fered. It is the second time Timothy Chasson, Art, husband
of the seminars originator Anne Burkus, former Art professor,
has taught it. On both occasions Chasson chose Piranesi as the
subject of the exhibit, due to his own familiarity with the print-
maker’s works and Grinncll’s impresswc Collection ofpieccs for
the students to choose from. He said that this Piranesi exhibit
eame out very differently from the previous one, partly because
the Faulconet Gallery is so much larger than the exhibition
space available in 1995.

The students devoted the ﬁrst half of the semester to re
search, learning about Piranesi and the art of museum instal-
lationt In the second half, they tackled issues like laying out
the exhibit in the gallery space, composing the wall text and
the essays for the catalog and publicity. One of the greatest
challenges, Chasson said, was settling on the specific sequence
of works and their placement in the gallery. Everything went
mostly according to plan, but, as occurs every time the course
is offered, deadlines were tight during the crunch at the end of
the semester. “It always takes longer than you think," he said.

Aside from the experience of curating an exhibition of a
major Renaissance artist, the students each gained a notch on
their resumes that will be invaluable if they choose to continue
in this line of work an option many Art History majors con-

The bulk of Grinnell's 'ranesi collection is composed of
82 etchings from the collection of alum John Frederic Mute
phy, class of 1910, donated by his family to the college after
his death. These were among the first works to be part of the
Grinnell College Art Collection. Additional works were later
purchased using money from the Marie-Louise and Samuel
R Rosemhal Fund, and the students also arranged to borrow
additional pieces from four other institutions.
