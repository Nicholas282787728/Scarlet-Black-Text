One mainstage play eliminated

BV REBECCA PARK

Dancc has been creating some drama later
ly. Or perhaps it would be more fitting to say
that it is producing less. In an effort to expand
the dance program, the Theatre department
has cut back the number of Mainstagc shows
produced each year.

Before the change, the department pro—
duced ﬁve shows each year: two plays in the
fall, and two plays and one dance show in the
spring. Last year, they began producing only
four shows, cutting one of the spring plays.
While the decision was made in part to reduce
stress on the department and on students, the
key issue was to more fully incorporate dance
into the recently integrated Department of
Theatre and Dance,

The Mainstage label refers to productions
that are part of the Theatre department’s oft
ficial season. Unlike strident—run independent
productions, Mainstage productions arc de»
signed and directed by Theatre faculty mem
bers or vrsitrrig guest directors.

Lesley Deimenieo, Theatre Chair, said that
under rhc ﬁvceproduction program, Grinnell

was exceeding the theatre capabilities of most
schools of similar size. This put strain on the
technical capabilities ofthe department.

Technical Director Erik Sanning, Theatre,
explained that With two spring plays, “from the
technical side, we’re not really able to give full
attention to either one ofthern," As a result, he
said, “dance is always getting the short staf .”

Under the old system, a dance show was
produced in the spring, but it had to compete
for attention with the two straight dramas.
That tension is now significantly decreased.
As Shannon Edwards '07, a dancer, said, “The
lighting designer actually works for us, the
costume shop rnanager actually does costumes
for us, where, in the fall [when the students put
on a non-Mainstage dance show], we all have
to do it ourselves."

Communicating the signiﬁcance of dance
was a major component orthis cutback, "We
really wanted to valorize that production as
being not separate but more part ofthe Main-
stage,"said Dclmcnico.

Although it has been rumored that the cuts
back is related to former Theatre professor Pip

Gordon’s resignation at the beginning of this
year, Delmcnieo said there is no connection.
“We started thinking about this while Pip was
here,"she aid.

Student response has generally been posi-
tive, Dale Maekey '07, who has acted in nu-
meroiis Mainstagc plays, said that there are
probably people who regret the loss ofthe ex»
tra opportunity to perform, but that this was
an overall improvement for actors and dancers.
“All dancers can benefit from acting and all ace
tors can benefit from dancing and movement,”
she sard.“It’sjust sending a message that dance
is something that’s important.“

The Theatre department has not yet made
a deﬁnite decision regarding the permanence
of the current Maiirstage schedule. According
to Delmenico, though, “so far it feels as if it
might'be working out."

She doubts that cutting out one Mainstage
play will restrict student creativity. “I’m always
impressed with the way students find a way to
do the productions that they want to do some
how," she said,

Sex and scandal rule the cinema this weekend

Midnight Cowboy (1969)
*itﬁﬁ

Man, what is it about Texas and prostitutes? I mean, look
at all the movies that feature Texan hookers: Mien-got com y.
T/ze Bert Lime tram/rattle m Tea-iii. . .well, okay, maybe that‘s it.
But Stllll

Miditi'got Cowboy tells the story of good 01' Texas couri-
try boy Joe Buck (Jon Voight), who travels to New York City
to make his living as a hustler, pleasuriiig rich and sophistie
cared women. This seemingly foolpioor plan ﬂops, and toe
ﬁnds himself living a nearly homeless liresryle and earning a
meager living as a “midnight cowboy," ruining tricks tor ncre
yous young men. Joe falls in with the sciaggiy Enrico “Raise”
Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and the rest of the movie concerns
itself with the struggles of this unlikely duo, inrersperscd with
ﬂashbacks detailing Joe’s life back home. Ratso’s failing health
causes him to become more and more dependent on Joe as the
movie progresses, adding depth to their relationship. Hoffman
is strong, but Voight is stunning in the ﬁrst movie of what her
came a long career.

Director John Schlesinger uses nearly every trick in the
book: transitions from color to black and white, ﬂashbacks,
ﬂash forwards and sound effects coming out of nowhere. It
produces a disorienting dream-like quality that keeps the view-
er hooked, although ar times it seems overderermincd to be a
“masterpiece.”

Shortbus Midnight

The music is excellent. The disarmingly laidrback theme
song “Everybody’s Talkin’" is a stark contrast to the gritty New
York setting, but it works nonetheless.

Mining/ii cornaey is the only Xﬂ'ﬂrcd ﬁlm to win an ose
car for Best Picture, although it’s since been restated as R. It
features some very graphic scenes for its time, iiicludrrig a very
disturbing rape sequence, and nudity and profanity abound.

Ifyou can handle that, however, you should have no trouble
enjoying this movie as it alternates between wry social come
ineritary and the heavier matter ofJoe’s past and present life.
Whoopeeeteeeyieyo, get along little doggics.

This Film is Not Yet Rated (2006)
tittﬁ

This documentary starts ottwith a bang(ing).The montage
of sex scenes from various NC717 movies lasts a fcw minutes,
and all I could think was, “What the hell is going on?"V\’ell,
that's exactly the same question the director, Kirby Dick, asks of
the Motion Picture Association ofAmerica's (MPAA) Ratings
Board, the highly secretive body that gives movies their ratings,
in 7721} Film 1‘: Nut Yet Rated.

The ratings system ostensibly gives parents a way or regu-
lating the content of the movies their children view, keeping
them from seeing sexually explicit or violent images. In real-
iry, the film argues, the system falls short of this lofty goal for

Wild Hogs

numerous reasons.

At times, the film takes on a dark, conspiratorial air, as
Dick's quest to uncover the deepest secrets oftlre ratings board
involves private investigators, anonymous sources and digging
through trasli.The film becomes even eeriei‘ as Dick illustrates
some disturbing trends in the ratings system, including appar-
ent homophobia and misogyny.

The documentary truly shines when it becomes as much
a cultural critique of the movie indusltyiand Americaias it
does air examination of the machinations of the MPAA.

But this cultural critique ultimately falls short. Upon dis-
covering the secret identities of the ratings board members,
Dick doesn't seem to notice that all but one ofthcm are white,
an oversight that seems bizarre after his generally thorough ins
vestigatiorr

Although Dick is serious about his mission, he manages to
keep the mood light with humorous graphics and clips. Tire
descriptions of which sex positions garner which ratings come
complete with animations.

VVllilc the movie can be slow at times, especially toward
the middle, this entertaining and informative documentary is
definitely worth watching for anyone interested in the inner
workings of the ﬁlm industry, or even for those who just want

to see multiple onrscreen sex scenes.
