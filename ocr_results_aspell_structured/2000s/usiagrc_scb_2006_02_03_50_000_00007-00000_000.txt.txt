Addressing immigration

It’s time for progressives to speak more about long-standing values, and less about supply and demand curves

After a draining day otTucsday classes, we crammed into
south Lounge hoping to watch a morality play on United
States immigration policyThe esteemed liberal professor from
Northern Iowa was set to rip apart the

Bible»thulnpiii’, gunrslingin' hate mone

get from Arizona.

Anxious for things to get underway,
some speculated about how the villain
would he slain and what xenophobic
words he would urrer beforejoinmg Doc
vid Horowitz in the dungeon ofdefeated
conservative demons.

In a clever twist, the villain began with a suspiciously come
passionate, articulate and wells asoned argument, while the
hero resorted to personal cr' 'cism, a litany of statistics and
awkward appeals to "our'judcoeChristian heritage.

Wc waited an hour for the two to fill their proper roles,
hut it never happened. And we nearly cried when the climax
turned out to be our would—be hero narrating a plotless and
insider-y story involving Bay Buchanan and Tom Tancredo in
a parking 10L

We didn’t learn the lessons we wanted to at Tuesday’s de-
bate, but we did learn that claims of rational superiority, dis—
cussion of supply and demand and invocation ofstatistic after
statistic is a recipe {or intellectual irrelevance.

As a community that prioritizes our tradition ofsocialjus-
rice and progressivisrn, we must recognize that the standard

contemporary liberal is less persuasive than the head ofa nativ-
ist renegade group.

As President George Bush's state of the union address also
painfully reminded us, most Americans
voted for Bush, who could speak plainly
about his values and vision, over Kerry,
who could crunch numbers but couldn’t
stop nuancing his convictions.

It’s time for progressives to stand up
what we believe in and speak clearly
about our ideals, on issues like immigrae
tion, which are emotionally charged, it is important to bring
more than our costrbeneﬁt analyses to the public forum.

At the debate, Minuteman co-founder

curing America's horders.

closing on America until “most Americans
are hack to work" is a concealed call to indefr
initely stiﬂe immigration. For the Minutc- and enrichsorlely.
man and other immigration roes, there will
never he enough Americans working.

Their recommendations “for tighter border control and
crackdowns against illegal immigrants, without an appropriate
gniesr worker program or allowance of more legal immigration,

would devastate our economy and our deepest traditions.

Immigrants don'tjust take thejobs no one wants, as was in-
sinuatcd at the dehate, hut also give rcal meaning to the Amerie
can dream and enrich American society

As highlighted in a recent US. Newr (a Mr'ldRz'Pm‘l edito-
rial entitled “Land of opportunity," immigrants, legal and ile
legal, have uprooted themselves from “the familiarity offatnily,
community, and culture," making them “self—selected risk-
takcrs, which is why they tend to be hardworking, self»starting,
creative and smart. "

It is advantageous to all Americans to cultivate this wealth
ofralenr and provide opportunities for suecess rather than rel-
egate immigrants to society’s periphery and force them to lan-
guish in poverty.

Across the Atlantic,old Europe is seeing
firsthand the consequences ofxenopl'lobla
and unfriendly immigration policies. In
France, immigrants have long heen excluded
from the rights and culture of mainstream
society, Last year, decprseated resentment
mutated into hatred and Violence as many
immigrants burned the cities that refused
them access.

Since America’s inception, we have taken
an alternative path, deriving strength from immigrants' cultural
diversity and strong work ethic. Let’s learn how to articulate
our pride in that tradition.
