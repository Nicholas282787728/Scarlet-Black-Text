Division race and hopes to get them when they face
North Division foes at the Midwest Crossover Tourney

When Grinnell softball heads to
Janesville, Wis, for the Midwest Crossover
Tournament this year, they might as well
replace the team’s Honor 6 logo with a
bullseye.

That's because the Pioneers beat all ﬁve
teams in the Midwest Conference North
Division at last seasons crossoverTourncy,
and face them all again this time.

A win and they’re in;
Tennis aims for playoffs

A victory over Knox gives tennis a South Division
sweep and a top spot in the playoff brackets

by Emanuel Andras

With one more victory. the Grinnell
men's tennis team will claim its fourth Cont
secutive Midwest Conference South Divi»
sion title.

On Saturday, the tram faces a tough
doubleheader against Knox College and
Luther College. Me Pioneers manage to
defeat Knox, they will sweep the Saudi
Division and clinch the number one seed
for die team tournament.

“The Knox march will be a big one this
weekend for two reasons,” and team Capt
rain Jim Finnessy "04, “In bearing Knox,
we will sweep the South Division and we’ll
be guaranteed to be number one seed out
of the south for the team tournamentAlso,
a victory over Knox would be our 20th win
of the season."

The competition promises to be intense
though. Head coach Andy Hamilton claims
“the most important match on Saturday
[will be against] Knox." However. the Flu»
neers do not expect the Prairie Fire to be as
strong as the competition that they have
faced over the last several weeks. Indeed,
Finnessy boasted, "i'm pretty conﬁdent that
we’ll stick it to them on Saturday.”

The Prairie Fire currently hold a 2-1
record in the South Division, having te-
cenrly lost to Lake Forest. Grinnell, at 3-0,
is a game ahead ofthem, Neither team has
clinched a playoe berm, but Grinnell can
clinch the top spot with a win.

“Even if we lose we have a chance to
advance," said Hamilton, but Grinnell
would prefer to have its playoiiffate in its
own hands. “We will be focused, We beat
Knox twice last season, 4—3, and this year

they are weaker and we are stronger "

Hamilton is also wary of Luther, der
scribing it as “a very good team,” and “tal»
ent wise, the second best in the iowa Con-
femncc.” Both marches will be played at
home on the new tennis courts on satura
day at 12:00 and 3:30 pm, respectively.

Grinnell may be ercing rough Compe»
tirion, but it has momentum in its favor.
After two vicrorres this weekend, the Pro.
nrcrs have achieved aschoolarecord 19 vic-
tories against only ﬁve defeats (the previ-
ous mark was 15 wins), and have won six
straight. Last Friday, the Pioneers bear
Ripon 5.2 and on the next day demolished
Lawrence 7.0, for a pair of critical confer.
ence wins.

“Going into the season. we ﬁgured that
Lawrence would be our roughest competlr
rion for a conference championship,” said
Finnessy, “but they are currently missing
three ofthcir top six starters. With the loss
ofthosc three players, out rradrtronal rival
Ripon will most likely br our toughest chal-
lenge in the conference tournament."

Playing on Friday against a Ripon Red
Hawks team that had bested them for the
past nine years in the regular season, Eli Best
'07, Rick Fenberr '05, Brij Patnaik ’05 and
Julian west ’06 provided solid play, Mn-
ning their respective singles matches.
crinnell's doubles wins came from me duo
ofPamaik/Shihan Abeygunavorda ’05, and
Kushal Shah 'oo/Etic ohm '07. The next

Coaches and players alike under
stand the importance of the season’s
home meet.

“[The Dick Young] is usually our only meet at home
unless we are hosting conference and there's something to
be said for a “home court advantage," said women’s roach
Evelyn Freeman. “we do back offthe training a bit during
the weekbefore the meet so we can perform well at home.”

Both the men's and women’s teams will have some
numbers from last week to try to improve upon. Grinnell

“We get rerrihc support from the student body as close
to so students volunteer to work as officials at the meet
and support their friends on the track team," said Evelyn
Freeman. “We go into most meets attempting to improve
our performances from meet to meet. Competing at home
in front ofthe campus community is a rare occurrence for
us during the season and does make it more special than
