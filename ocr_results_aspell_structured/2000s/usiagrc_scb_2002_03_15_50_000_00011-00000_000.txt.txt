Times flies when you’re
ﬂipping out

l've got 57 items on my eo.do lise. Pve

my time. To do this, first. 1 add it on to my

famous people think about‘time manage.

Ovid said “time fires." 1 don't think
this guy ever sat through my maior Asian
Religion class, where 1 swear to god thee
time not only crawled bur crawled backs
wards' Someone else said that time ﬂies
whenyou re having fun, but this eoo is not
altogether aeeuraee. Maybe, “Time flies
when you're having fun, and ehen plume
men to thegroundin ablurofflamerwhen
you’re not.”

Now, daeres a wonderful proverb that
goes something like, "Astitcli in eime saves
nine." That's probably really, really good
advice on howl could manage my time. in
fact,lbs:itcouldsolveallofmytimcshortr

time: Nine what? -

Perhaps i should follow someone else’s
advice,.. maybe Homer's “There is a eime
for many words, and there is also a eime for
sleep." However, I’m not sure ifby “many
words" he meaneeighe to ten pages. double
spaced, with standard margins. 1 mean,
that’s aloe ofwords. And maybe instead of
the“Therc is also a eime for sleep" he should
have gone with “There is also a time for
caffeine pills."

Albert Einstein's statement that “rim:

“This paper is a month late," she might
say

And ehen I‘d say, “You know, time is an
illusion,"

And ehen she’d say, “Oh, Okay."

And ehen id say, “Sorry for the eonrto

And ehen she'd say, “No problem,"
probably as she is writing a big A on the

Then there’s Robert Byrne's saying,
“Doinga thing well is often awasee ofeime."

by rhe words ofMaleolin Forbes who said,
“There is never enough time, unless you're

Well, at lease l've finished writing my
eolumn. And that is something. Only 37
more things to go. But don't worry about
me. I’ll get it all done, 1 always do. semester

Best Adapted Screen-
play

The most logical way to start is
to eliminate the unworthy candi-
dates. GloonWorM Tom turned it
offhalfway through: Joe refused to
watch it because he knew it

mose worthy, bur ies sea.

We're Ith with two screen-
plays, both CDnmndeiS for Best Pic»
rure. Neither is particulariyworthy. In 1/7!
Bedroom is missing a second act. A Benin;—
ﬁliMind is missing accurate information.

This is the first year for this award. and
