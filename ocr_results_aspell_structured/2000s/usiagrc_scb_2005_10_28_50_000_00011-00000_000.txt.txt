Pioneers soar over Carroll but fall to Red Hawks

sv MARISA WHITLEV

The Grinnoll mcns socccr scason is winding
down but the teitm is still going strong. The Pioneers
brought in it big win last weekend, shutting out car-
roll on Saturday with a score of3-0.

Forward Andrew Walsh ’09 scored the first goal
at minute 18; midﬁelder Matt Pﬂnum ’06 then scored
two goals at minutcs 27 aud 39. Although Carroll had
more shots on goal during the game, an impressive
performance by gotlltccpcr sam Lancaster ’08 kcpt
Carroll from putting any points on the board.

On Sunday the men lost a wellrplayed match
against Ripon 1ro. The first half of the game was
scoreless, but the Red Hawks slipped a goal in during
the 69th minute ot’regulation.

Dcspitc the loss. the team is happy with the way
they played and they hope to keep it up torThursday's
game against Simpson. the last game ofrhc season.

“We put in a really hard wcek of training," said
Walsh. “We came out harder than the other teams."

The Pioneers even surprised themselves with the
level of their perfotmancc against Carroll and Ripon
over the weekend.

“[The cnrroll game] was probably the best soccer
wc'vc played in forever,"said defender and co-captain
Jeff VVallnce ’06.

The Pionccr's solid effort on both sides ofrhc ball
made a clear difference during the matches.

[In rhc Carroll game] we ﬁnally got into a posr
session game," said defender Aden Stinebrickners
Knuffmami '08. ”We really worked over break on of»
fcnsc and possession and it finally come togethcrr"

Ripon is currently ranked fourth in the Midwest
Conference with Carroll hot on their heels in fifth
place. The Pioneers were dropped to seventh place
and mathematically eliminated from the conference
after their defeat against St. Norbert on Oct. 2.

Fall break gnve the soccer team an opportunity to
focus on their practice and the victory against Carroll
over the weekend boosted the team’s morale.

“I thought we had rhc right attitude for both
games." said Walsh.

“[The Ripon game] was one ot the ﬁrst games

we Expected to win nil year," said Wallace, “Wc just
couldn't score."

Kauffman attributed the loss to difﬁculty with
defensive restarts. a tendency to lose marks nnd ulr
timatcly. the "one goal they finished and we didn't."
which Kauffman described as. “the bane of [the] en—
tire season."

The men are optimistic about the upcoming
match against Simpson, eager to end the season on
a posltlvt note.

“Ifth play like we playcd this weekend, it’ll be a
really good game. a hard—fought game." said Wallace.

“[We just need to] put in on: good performance,"
said Walsh. “I think we have n pretty good chance of
beating pretty much anyone right now."
