Threcyears ago, a group offake nuns introduced
Ellie Kemple ’06 to hip-hop dance. They wielded
sex toys, stripped on stage and inspired her to join
Emanate her first semester at Grim-tell, Now a see
nior, she leads the group, trying to make the best of
the dance group’s dwindling membership.

Unfortunately, trying to continue the vision
of founder Marcos Davalos ’03 has been difficult.
“There‘s a terror because when [Davidos] left,
organization was gone. Marcos was big on social
satire, but we have less of that these days," Kemple
said, “We used to be controversial."

Along with the current lack of organization,
the participation rate has also decreased in com—
parison to past years. According to Kemplc, thirty
people were in last year's show, and this semester,
the group has about ten people.

Since many members have graduated or are
currently studying abroad, their pool of potential
choreographers and leaders isn’t as large.

Emanate consists solely of female members.
"we dent have any guys. We have trouble attract—
ing men who want to dance with naked women,”
Kemple said,

The group thinks the absence otmales has not
affected the overall quality of dieir dances. They
said weekly practices have helped the members
bond and create intimate relationships.

“The girls are really dedicated and extremely
talented. I'm so lucky," kcmplc said. “1 know that
we’ve done practices where wejust sit and talk bee
cause people have had a hard time with the dance,
or school, or with their families."

A lack of males has led ro geiiderebending.
Dancing to Michael Jackson and “Closer" by Nine
Inch Nails, the women incorporate masculine and
feminine role reversals into their performances.

“No cross-dressing. We are [tryin ] not be
overly explicit during traderoff roles between]
guys and girls," Veronica Clark ‘07 said.

Although the group performs classical dances
such as ballet and rap, Emanatc emphasizes hip
hop dance. The genre not only functions as a me—
dium ofexpression, but also increases awareness of
and respect for the art.

“In most dance groups, people don't recognize
hip—hop as a real dance, an art. It’s not like grinding
up on someone at Harris,” Clark said.

Among other props, the group incotporatcs
dildos,lnssos and six foot tall inﬂatable penises into
their performances.

“Ridiculous props celebrate the sexuality that
can be incorporated in dance, not to pornographic
levels, butjust for them to feel comfortable in their
body and movements," Claik said. “This year, I'm
doing a dance with two other girls, wearing chaps,
lassos, ropes and other crazy stuff."

With smooth, provocative body rolls and sug-
gestive hip-hop moves, Emanate wants to provide
a safe haven for the comfortable expression of
sexuality. ,

“We have this suggestive tradition, and it's n
lot about sexuality,” Kemple said. “1 like to think
that we are turning the traditional View of women
[around], empowering ourselves by taking on our
shirt because it’s Lin about personal choice."

Artist and activist speaks out against censorship

Fusca, cont. from p. 5

in Colorado, ofJohn Luriimy, the artist at ASU in Arizona; Steve
Kurts from Critical Art Ensemble, who was indicted for using
bacteria as an ant project. There are lots of artists and intellectuals
who've been affected as part ofthc political climate.

Artists have a unique role as social and political critics in that they
bring in creative elements. What are these and how can they be
used to subvert the system, so to speak?

Well, I’m not so sure that they subvert the system. I just think
that art is a state in which.things can be said and done because arr»
ists in general have a little bit more independence, a little more aue
tonomy. So they can get through the cracks a little bit more, whether
or not people want to pay attention to that work; in some contexts
they don’t, in some they do. But I’m not so sure whether art actually
does subvert the system per se.

1 mean, there are some examples like the Yes Mcn, for example,
and how they get into the board rooms of multinational corporar
dons or made the fake website for Dow Chemical in which they
apologized for the Bhopal incident and got Dow all upset because
it looked like they were real representatives from Dowl think those
are examples in the present ofhow art has tried to intervene and ad
dress a public that is outside of the world of art and raise important
political issues Burl think that they're an exception; they‘re not the
rule. ‘

THE NEW LIVE ALBUM FEATURING
JOHN MAYER ON GUITAR AND VOCA
AND THE LEGENDARY RHYTHM
SECTION OF STEVE JORDAN ON DRUMS
AND PINO PALLADINO ON BASS.

ﬂuence you and your work?
I was a semiotics major at Brown and studied it lot of critical
theory. 1 was very inﬂuenced by people like Foucault and by psy-
choanalytic theory, and i started after graduate school to get more
interested in postecolonial thought and to read people like spivak,
Edward Said, Homi Bhaba and Smart Hall I got very interested in
their work, and I think that that was sort otthc beginning ofwhat
has sustained itself as an ongoing theoretical interest. ‘

What message are you trying to send to society and how would
you like your audience to respond to it?

One ofthc things I’ve learned from the experience ofmaking art
is you can't control what people do with it. 1 can say, “Oh, I would
like people to have rhis kind of experience," or “I would like them to
think about these things," or “1 would like them to go away with a
different understanding," but I can’t control it! I cannot. And ifI try
to control it,1'm focusing on the wrong thing. What I need to focus
on is my work, not how to force the audience to think one thing or
another or to come away with one thing or another.

They will go away with what they go away with. They’ll think
about it, and maybe they'll think one way about it tomorrow and
another in two weeks and another way about it in two years, and
I can't control that. I can say what I think about things, but that
doesn’t mean that you or anybody else is going to understand me. So
I can’t worry so much about making sure that they get it. ljust try
to make the work that is important to me and hope that others will
get something from it.
