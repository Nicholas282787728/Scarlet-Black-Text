Worldly engagement?

I’ve betome distressed recently at the general atmosphere
of political indirierence here at orinnell, even as the world»
at-large slides ever more towards what is either a slate of
anarchy or the possibility thereof. Grinnellians, rouse
yourselves from this selirohsessed parochialisml lhere are
happenings and goings-on out there, many miles beyond
campus. and it is our responsibility as citizens oia republic
to take account of them, Read a national newspaper, peruse
the current arrairs journal or your choice (i prefer The
Amerimn Prospect, ihe New Republic, and Dissent), or listen
to hint. Even if you choose not to act directly, willful
ignorance should never‘be an option. Find timein your day,
keep track oi major events, and formulate opinions tor public
discourse. re rail in this simple regard is to diseniranchise
ourselves.

Selling your soul to Crushmaster

For several days now We been receiving emails from someone
called The Erushmasteri I remain skeptical for several reasons.
First, there is a logistical prohlem’with rhe chishmaster. In
order to discover your ”crushlink," you need to guess his or
her name. However, I usually end up getting so frustrated that
I enter everyone's name I an think of But you don’t know if
the original trush YOU got was atmall ill in earnest or
whether it was sent by another bumbling idiot like yourself
who was listing the names ofeveryone they knew, inadvertently
adding them to their “crush list' and thus sending crushes to
all of their friends Then there” is the issue of “hints Basically
what it comes down to is that if you register with So- and So’ 5
Sweepstakes, providing your address, passport, the names of
your unborn children, you can get a ‘hint' as to your crush.
Nevelmlnd the fact that you’ ve sold your soul to the devil to
get it. Basically, I feel like my emotions are tossed about like
so many cookies during a Sunday iii in h ngover My fragile
little heart can't take this anymore."‘ ‘ dd Davis ’04

Preserve plan traditions

There are some good things aboutPlans vzvthey go a
lot faster, your autnﬁnger list moves along with you, and
PlanLove v2 has appeared; however, there are a lot of fea-
tures ahout Plans v2 that I'm not as thrilled with. First of
all, ”autoﬁnger” has been changed to ”autoread.” 1 under»
stand how this might have happened, as you no longer
type in user names, but I still think the lingo of the old
system should be preserved. Also, the color scheme is too
pastel. It is not so much the taste of the colors that both-
ers me, but the difﬁculty I have reading them against a
white background.

I really appreciate that the Jnnathahs keep the Plan
system alive and make sure that it is running smoothly.
However, I would be even happier if they tried keeping the
traditions of plans alive along with the program.
