eltccs, meetings with students and tac-
ulty on campus and evaluations.

Dennis, Don and Gallant all posr
sess educational backgrounds similar to
Grinnell's liberal arts tradition.

“One of the things I'm really ek-
crted about is that all at the RLCs
come from amazing undergraduate
institutions that will help them under
stand Grinncll," said Assistant Dean
of Students and Director of Residence
Life and Orientation Andrea Conner
“They have an inherent understanding
ofhow we function."

Dennis graduated from the College of William and
Mary in 2003 wrrh a degree in Government and minor in
sociology. She currently attends the college as a graduate
strident pursuing a degree in Educational Leadership and is

years, but at the same time I’m excited," Dennis said in a
phone interview.

ment in Postsecondary Education attending the University
otlowa, received her bachelor's degree in Psychology and
Studio Art from Kenyon College in 2005. After graduating
from Kenyon, she worked as a page layout designer for the
Chicago Sun Times for three years.

Student Affairs," Don said. “But I missed that smaller comr
munity that you can only have on a small campus."

Education and Student Personnel Administration at New
York University He graduated from Brandeis University in
2008 with a degree in sociology and Politics.

In addition to having educational backgrounds in higher
education, all of the new RLCs have hands-on experience
in Student Affairs.

“A lot otmy current experience in student Affairs came
from my college experience," Dori said, “I was pretty in
volved in undergraduate orientation—1 developed a prer
orientation program [at Kenyon] for first year students that
helped them get acclimated to campus,"

Dennis echoes this involvement
in student Affairs through her work
in the admissions ofﬁce and orientar
tion and family programs. However.
she wasn’t always interested in higher
education.

“1 was a government major. l was
going to go to law school,” Dennis
said.

However, at the beginning or her
Senlm year, however, she began to me

“I thought, ‘1 love working with
students: My mentor told me that I
could do it is a career She steered me towards higher edtrt
cation and administration," Dennis said. "I wrote my mast
tcr's thesis on how tirst generation college students transr
tion to school and I would love to get involved in doing this
on campus."

Gallant, too, was very engaged outside ofthe classroom
during his undergraduate years, He was involved in new
student orientation, student mentoring, strident governr
ment, and the career center. Through [ltC career center, he
discovered Student Affairs. currently working at Columbia
University. Gallant adVises student groups focused around
religious, spiritual, humanitarian, and social advocacy issues

cial advocacy.

“I have strong values around social justice and civic enr
gagement," Gallant said.

my wardrobe," Don said,
