After five years at 1123 East Street, Music
House will be silenced, and mmy students aren't
talaug die news lightly.

When a group ofGruinell students applied for
an occo house focused on music, instead orti.
tling their proposed project Music House, they
called it Freesound House, naming it after the cam.
piis musicians group. Freesound.The group wanted
the name oftheii house to underscore the fact that
their project would serve doe commuuiryas awhole.

“It's a project that I've invested a lot in," said
Brendan Baker, the proposed coordinator of
Freesound House, . makingsure that this project
would be something that any rational person
couldn’t turn down because it's such a service to
the community" [Freesound] is a student organi»
alien and it's open to allstudenrs. Ifsomeone were
to evaluate our proposals side by side, wrdiour let.
ting the old Music Houses he a negative inﬂuence,
1 think they would have a hard time accepting the
other applications over ours, ” sad Baker, adding
that he means no offence toward the groups who
won the OCCO houses.

Adrienne Celt ‘05, another current resident of
Music House and applicant for Freesound House
echoed Baker’s frustration. “I’m not entirely sure
prised that the adminisrration wanted to change
out the houses.” she said. “But I was very angry."

Petitioning for change

This anger led celr to draft a petition for more
occo housing and more practice space for mu»
sicians.

“I was sitting around doing my homework and
checking Plans,” she said, “and just got really an-
gry that there vos not much consideration by the
administration for [Freesoundl House. I made of
one of those spur of the moment decisions." Celt
hopes that with more occo housing, Freesound
House can exist next year. “There was not enough
information going out to students who weren't in
the housing draw. ..,1 saw this as a situation in
need of more than just cursory or underetheebreatl-i
griping. So I vocalized.”

Celt posted petitions around mmpus and col.
lected over 100 signatures. She is planning to email
the petitions to Tom Crady, vice president for stue
dent Services, this afternoon and attach a detailed
cover letter about the lack of sufficient OCCO
housing and musical practice space for campus
bands, She will also submit testimonials about the
benefits ofMusic House from alumni, especially

then who lived in die house.

Several sraltmembers have already signed Celts
petition, Celt is trying to actraet more faculty sup.
port, especially from Music professors who wrote
letters supporting the existence ofFreesound House.
The petition is addressed to the Grinnell commue
niry as a whole so that faculty and staffas well as
students can sign it.

Baker has made a separate petition, which fo.
cuses exclusively on the need for more musical prac—
tice space rather than coupling the issue with the
need for more off-campus collegeeawned housing.
He has collected more than 250 signatures sup»
porting an increase in musical praerioe space and
believes that he will collect more in the following
week.

“I’coplc didn’t realize that Music House was just
a project house like any other," said Baker. “They
thought it was something that was permanently
established, but that's not the case.“

Though Baker believer that Freesound House
will not exist nest year and that the issue that needs
to be addressed is the addition ofmusieal practice
space. he still hopes that Freesound House will

someday be a reality.

“1 wish that we could get another occo
house, we have a lot invested in that house,"
said Baker of i 123 East street.

Since Baker will serve as conceru Chair next
year, he is already working with Mark Henry ’05
and Andy Grimm ‘05, presldcnt» and vice prcsl»
dent—elect to address rhe issue of musical practice
space. “[Ftcesound] is probably going to petition
the music department to have some interim space
developed until the situation can be worked our."

said Baker.

OCCO housing and musical
practice space

Last year, there were 12 OCCO houses. but
diis year there are only seven, The houses at 913
and916-l8 Sistrh Avenue and 1008 Park street were
demolished last summer. Additionally. 1019 and
1023 Park street. the old German and Russian
Houses, were given to ITS when it moved from
Darby. This forced German and Russian Houses
to relocate to other OCCO houses on Park Street.

will be added until the completion oftlie campus
center," said Interim Director ofHousing Mandy
Fox.

students who applied to live in Freesound
House respect the Housing Committee’s decision
to have inreinarional Golll‘lnci House occupy l 128
Bast street licxr year. However, these students are
upset because the loss of Music House means that
campus bands will have nowhere to practice, This
year alone, approximately nine music groups have
used the house on a regular basis,

“1 was told by Mandy Fox that the other applie
cations were a lot better,” said Baker. “it wasn't that
ours waslﬁ legitimate. It's Just that the odrers were
much better. Frankly, i don't see how that's actually
possible," he said, noting that the applicants for
Freesound House submitted a petition with 220
signatures supporting the Houses :xlstence as part
ofrheir application. “1 know that there have been
people who felt cxcludcd socially from past houses
which, aside from not being our groups fault, was
something we had addressed in our application as
an image to reverse."

“The logical thing to do would have been to
cicare an onrumpus practice space before Music
House was taken away,” celt said. “i heard that
several people on the Housing Committee 511;»
gesred dais idea," ,

Bur, according to Fox, the Housing commit.
tee is not responsible for finding a practice space
for campus musicians. “in the past Music House
has relied on the Housing committee to solve the
issue ofpraetieespaoehurit’s notal‘iousing issue,"
said Foxi

With the stonewall Resource coalition raking
over Loose Pit Lounge and the Music department
forbidding amplified instruments in the practice
rooms because these rooms aren’t soundproof, two
potential practice Spacn are unavailable.

The future of Music House

All ofrhe applicants for Freesound House were
ﬁrst or second—years. Baker is not sure that every-
one who applied to live in Freesound House will
apply next year, but he believes that a musical on:
campus collegeowned house is not permanently
dead.

“ifl don‘t [apply], I'm sure that daere will be
people who will," said Baker. “Unless some more
suitable alternative is presented to us, I’m sure that
people will continue to apply for that. As things
stand now, there is no place for bands to practice
on campus and that's atrocious."
