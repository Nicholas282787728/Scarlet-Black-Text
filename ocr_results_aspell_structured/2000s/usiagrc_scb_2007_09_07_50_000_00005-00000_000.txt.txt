The quest to get this artist from a
dusry farm in Morocco Io the green fields
or lowI hogIn wuh Kay Wilson, the tile
rator of the collection at Faulconer Gale
lery. She heard that Morocco was becomv
ing known for the quality of its artists
and soon looked into getting Moroccan
artists to Giinnell. “That’s the mission
of Faulconer Gallery at Griniiell, to understand another culture," said Wilson.
“There has been a buzz that something exciting and powerful is going on among
Moroccan artists."

On one of several trips to Morocco, a drive into the countryside intro-
duced Wilson to Kabhaj and her studio They both liked the idea of Kahbaj
coming out to Grinnell and using Iowa marble to create a lasting work. “I read
many things about Gtinnell and the country, and I felt that the right thing is to
make a sculpture on the grass,"said Kabbaj, “Not a big sculpture, [one] that is
in osmosis with the nature, because the nature here is very strong."

In her talks with Wilson after seeing the other architecture around cam-
pus, Kabbaj noted the extremely vertical feeling of many orthc buildings. In
response, she has designed her sculpture to introduce a new element to this
landscape. “She came up with this idea otsorncthing low. horizontal and bridg-
ing, like the prairie, it moves gently,"said Wilson.

As she grows older and more experienced, the idea of a site-speciﬁc and
longrlasting work appeals to Kabbaj's nature, “I would like to makc something,
that when you see it, you think it has been there a long time, not something to
shock the people or the students," said Kabbaj. “Before with sculpture, you try
ro make many things, you know? so now i try to use my age and cxpcricncc, so
with all of[my next sculptures] Iwant to be minimalist.”

Burling photo exhibit shows “colorful immediacy"

a glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of
the typical illegal immigrant: a glimpse into a
unIvIrsal mix of joy and fear, passion and quir

Kropa's pictures possess an energy that can
only be found in the quick moments inside the
events that swirl around pcoplc in a town like
Little Allende, Iowa (a ﬁctional construct; the
