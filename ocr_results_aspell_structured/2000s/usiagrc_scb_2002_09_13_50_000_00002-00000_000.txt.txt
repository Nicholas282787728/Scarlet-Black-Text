know," Allan said. “I rhink it’s really disappointing rhe
college hasn’i had more ro offer in rhe way ofsuitersryle
living in the residence halls, where you have a barhroom
and a kirchenerre and a common room."

The residence halls piesenily conrain rwo coeopsr
one on Cleveland ﬁrst and one on Gaies ﬁrst. siirah
Young ‘03 eurrenily occupies rhc Cleveland coop and
lasr year lived in occo housing “Living in a coeop,
you gei ihe beneﬁrs ofliving in a house wirh rhc ben-
eriis or living in a dorm,” she sold. “I can rake a barn
wirhour worrying abour whose skanky ieer have been
in rhcre. At rhe same iimc, being on campus, 1 ﬁnd us
a lor easier to meei new people.”

No co.ops are speciﬁcally in ihe ﬂoor plans or rhe
new residence halls. This does nor mean, however, rhar
drop; will nor be a pair or ihc new residence halls, ac
cording io the adminisriarion. Cradysaid, “We did say
we wanted ihe dorms designed for as much ﬂexibility as
possible, ro allow for ihe possibiliry ofcomps.” Larson
said, “The new residence halls will have comps, We jusr
don‘r know how many."

More ceriain is rhe number orpeople occo hous-
ing will accommodaie in she future. By zoil, riie
planned number orsiudenis occupying occo house
ing will drop rrorn ihe presenr 127 ro 48.

Allan iliinks srudenis will miss rhe availabiliry orihis
housing oprion. “For a campus rhar prides iiselron die
versiry, I think line adminisrrarorsi need ro rake inro
accounr rhar having a diverse studeni body necessarily
means rhar rhcre will be diveise srudeni inseresis," Allen
said. “And rhar includes srudenrs who don't waiii rhe
traditional dormirory =xp:rience."
