Clarifying college policies is essential

Administration needs to make rules and regulations more accessible to the student body

Clearly articulatrug gaiidelincs and policies and
making information more accessible will make every
one’s lives easier. Making simple things such as the
finals week schedule easy to find and access can free

up time and energy for dealing with
more complicated situations.

For things like mental hcalth

transfer credits, Grinnell should
centralize and document adminis—

Returning to campus is a mess. It's the time when
most students have to deal with administration polls
cies that they generally know notl'r
ing about.

We are often iiusure ofwhen ex-
acrly we‘re allowed back rnto dorms,
counting on a latetintbreak email
from Housing to fill us in on the
specifics. Those of us on medrcal
leave or academic suspension of-
ten discover whether or not we’re
allowed to return to school just days before classes
begin.

This scrambling and confusion isn't just the result
of a new semesteritlie frantic search for lnfOIl‘naT
tion that welcomes many returning students exposes
a breakdown of communication that is typical of
Grinnell. Important information regarding things
like mental health leave, ﬁnals schedule, or transfer
credits are only available in the student handbook or
somewhere on our labyrinthine website.

Students can (and do!) spend hours looking in er
thcr place for basic information about college rules

and procedures,

The Handbook is vague about speciﬁc issues
(what classes from other
colleges will transfer to
Grinnell? How binding
are the decisions orJud-
Co.> can 1 call the college
for a ride ifI miss the last
Des Moines shuttle?) and
the website is so dense,
poorly organized and
unsearchable that’s it’s often useless in our quest for
information.

There are great things about
not having a setsintsrone proces

Ijust spent six months in Buenos

me with daily trials, like public trans-

On my
cross-city bus rides, I saw nobly div
lapidated buildings, beggars without
shoes, grafﬁti on every wall, and strike
ingly beautiful people. I Found a true
sense of satisfaction when I arrived at
my destination (except for the time I
took the wrong bus, ended up in the
wrong neighborhood at 2:00 am, and
had to explain to my host family howl
got there).

And now I am back at Gtinnell, a
place that lacks the newness and et-
citement ofa foreign city. There is no
male to drink at 5:00, no delicious red
wine, but better coffee. Though not
exciting,I find the silence ofGrinnell’s
campus at night striking. It is a drastic
change from city Living and the silence

samc friendships tharl had before I left,
into the same activitics, into the pattern
of Giinnell life. The excitement for
classes and the pleasure of seeing old

find some way to participate in campus

In my grappling with that dilemma,
there are questions that 1 can’t answer.
