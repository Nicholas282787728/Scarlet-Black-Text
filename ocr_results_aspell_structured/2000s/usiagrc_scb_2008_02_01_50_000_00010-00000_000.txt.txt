Slingin’ Ink:

HYSARAHMIRK

Heavy metal music blasts from the speaks
ers behind the counter of Slingin’lnk, the tat-
too studio whose tinted windows and neon
Sign popped up across the street from Pagliai's
in August. The music and abounding glossy
trade magazines covered in busty. tattooed
women are the extent of Slingin‘ Inks’ adhe-
sion to the traditional gritty image of a tat-
too parlor. Instead, Slingin‘
Ink is an artists’ studio. It’s a
community center, granted.
for a rather specifrc type of
communrty. for a diverse and able in, mg”
surprising community that is
growing right here in smalls
town Iowa.

Most of the artists at
Siingin’ Ink weren’t born much before tattoo
veteran Darren Mekeag founded the original
studio in Oskaloosu in 1994. However their
young ages does not imply lack of experience
or expertise. Josh Coburn, 27, has been pierc—
ing longer than anyone in Iowa—Io years—
and now specializes in body modiﬁcation, the
kind of aesthetic that’s showcased by the two
large rings implanted under the skin of his
hands and the intentional scar that runs down
his forehead.

Coburn also performs suspensions, a tech
nique which involves running books under

' customer's skin and hanging their bodies from
the ceiling. “It's really important for people
to understand that it's not a pain thing," said
Coburn, describing suspeusrorr as a rrrual pro
cedure. “It's about positively rakrng control of
your life."

In spite ofspending his days placing metal
hooks into people's backs, Coburn is uot'the
tladirional hardcore macho, blood-lust rar-
tooed stereotype. When he’s not piercing, he
writes and has Self’PHbllSth two books, The
front ofthe studio is lined with black shirts he
screenrprinted and sells under his own Clotl‘r
rug line. Every year, Coburn and McKeag sit
on the State Board of Health to provrde pro
fessional input on reVistoiis to state tattoo and
body modifrcatron laws.

For Cobuin, the process behind putting
holes or ink rn his and others’hodies rs deeply
personal. “I was never comfortable in my own
skin, so I made it comfortable for me,” he said.
His t’orearms are covered in a collage ofrattoos
representing his childhood and family. His
favorite tattoo, though, is three simple dots
running down his forehead. “I put it on my
forehead for myself, not anyone else."

Across from Coburn’s enclosed body mod-
ification room is Alex Vance‘s tattoo table, sur-
rounded by a counter and stools where people
can sit like they are in a 50's diner and observe
their friends getting tattooed. Vance is a 23-
year-old from oskaloosa who got his frrst tat-

While some high school art classes might
surmise the shockingly minimal extent of
Vance's tonnal art training, his freehand
sketches of cute owls and sharks thrashing
through violent waves are precise and cres
ative. “If someone wants a
shark, I’ll pnll an rntage off
of Coogle because I have no
idea what a shark looks like,
really," Vane explained. Afr.

shark straight onto her skin,
and they’ll check it over one
last time for changes. Then he’ll tuin on his
whrrrrng needle machine and ink away—us-
ing a thin “liner” needle for outside lilies and a
tool that resembles a paintbrush made oftiny
needles for the shading.

Rather than feeling stiﬂed in Grinnell’s
t'our downtown blocks, the young guys see the
studio’s move to town as an exciting change
from growing up in Oskaloosa. “The only
place to car there was the howling allcy," said
Coburn, shaking his head.

“You can't beat Pagliai's." grinned Vance

Even with the move, the shop has a folr
lowing, Just like traditional artists, the guys
at Slingin’ Ink have a reputation. People drrve
from Omaha and the Twin Cities for their unr
usual and custom woik. After all, it's not just
big city hipsters and iash college students who
get tattoos.

The walls of Slingin’ Ink are covered in
awards, bizarre trophies and news clippings
celebrating their work. Cohutn and McKeag

cities, people don't k because they're lnl’lmk
dated," sard Coburn. “Small towns, people in
quiie because they assume you're gonna be the
neighboi or the guy they see at the bake sale,"

The guys seem to enjoy disiupting the
tiadirioiial views of tattoo artists. “People are
blown away by how friendly we are and how
intelligent, and [we] aren’t just drinking beer
and wrenching motorcycles,” said Coburn,
“we definitely want [Slingin’ ink] to be a
community, because this is what we love and
the people who hang out here love it. "

This community has already started to at—
tract Griiinell students after the move in the
fall. “It was kind ofa rash decision," said Alex
Schechrer ’10, explaining his most recent tat-
too. After meticulously planning the giant

Sehechter agrees that Slingin Ink is not
what he expected when he stopped by Grin—

guys have there I had not
really heard a lot and I was
real skeptical going in," he
confessed. “But they were re-

itywork.”
