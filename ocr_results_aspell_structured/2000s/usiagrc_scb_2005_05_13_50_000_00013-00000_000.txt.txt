The meaning of Islam

I write in regard to what has been written about Islam, Is
lamic principles and the Intifada in lasr week's edition to cor-
rect some mistaken interpretations. To start with, I would like
to emphasize the real meaning ofthc word
Islam. In Arabic, Islam is a derivative of
the word sir/ram, which means peace, Isr
lam means to be in peace with God, with
others and with oneselﬁTheret’ore, I would
like to encourage all who are interested to
read more before they give false interpreta-
tions of the Qur’an, the holy book of Is
lam. Also, I want to make it clear that the
world “Allah" in Arabic means “God" in English. Furthermore,
for Moslems, religion is a personal faith, and non-Moslsms are
included in the deﬁnition of Islam; that means that Moslems
seek peace with non-Moslems as well as with Moslems. Fur-
Lhermore, Islam encourages the concept of negotiation, eons

In Arabic, ls/am is a derivative afthe
word saldam, which means peace.
Islam means to be in peace with God,
with others and with oneself

trary to the claim of the writer of last week article, “Palestinian
Group misleads." He gave a wrong explanarion or the word
“path" in the Qur’an. Also, he did nor specify which chaprer
in the O‘ur’an he was talking about. The
Moslem Strident Association has the Engs
lish translation of the (hlr’an and anyone is
welcome to borrow it, and to ask any ques-
tion about Islam.

Finally, in regard to the Intifada, I will
not go into details because I am not writing
a political point ofview, However, I believe
that facts stand for themselves and offer ch
idence ofwhat happened and what is going on. In conclusion,I
will seize the chance to call the community for more tolerance
and understanding

Not nearly as poetic as Shakespeare

Dearest Editors,

As the photographer who took pictures of Fair Ladies and
the Asst. Designer for the show l am appalled by the short
ave-paragraph coverage on the production.
Not only was there no true plot summary
of what the play was about but Ms. Jares
incorrectly called Lesley Delmenico the
producer and then proceeded to imply rhar
she had adapted the play from Japanese,
which she did not, Furthermore, Ms. Jares
incorrectly refers to Nikita Umnov as a she,
which I'm sure he does not appreciateThis
is horribly bad copyzediting my photo-
graph for the story even refers to Nikita as
Lord Shigemori, obviously a male character) that reﬂects ill
on the $88 as well as Ms.]ares, for I’m assuming she did not
intend such a mistake.

Furthermore, the brevity of rhe piece is an insult to the
students who worked on it. There are no quotes from Direc-
tor Delmenico or her Assistant Cate Bardelson ‘05. Instead

Applause for

The Spring Waltz Committee wanted to take the oppor-
tunity to thank everyone who made it to Darby’s Inaugural
Waltz. We hope that it was memorable. I think few people
realize how many people are involvcd in making events like
Waltz a reality, and so we'd like to take the time to thank
those people who often go unnoticed.

l-‘irst,we'd like to extend our appreciation to Mark Godar,
Rick Whitney, Mike Burt and Dixie Hansen, all of Facili-
ries Management, for taking the time to meet with us on a
number otoccasions and for being so responsive to our many
questions and concerns.

Additionally, there are a few individuals,working behind
the scenes, to whom we are indebted, Rex Arthur, of FM,

As a Theatre major and the
photographer for this assignment...
/ am oﬁ‘ended by the lack ofcancem
the 5&8 has for covering this play
and other Theatre projects

there are two quotes byTodd Pltman, one orwhich is specific
to his character and not the show and experience as a whole.
This production had all guest designers as well as three stage
managers. It was an unusual production
but was covered in the paper as if it was
a haphazard student production and not
the final performance by the theatre dsr
artment.

As a theatre major and the photogra-
phcr tor this assignment, who could have
been interviewed myselﬂI am oftcndcd by
the lack of concern the 553 has for cov-
cring this play and other Theatre Departs
menr projects. in the future, either cover it
completely, or leave it to a news briefbecause at least you run
lcss ofa risk otmisrcprssenring over two months ofhard work
by over 30 Grinnell students and staff.

Sincerely,

waltz helpers

was not only incredibly friendly and helpful, but was also
unbelievably accomodating when it came to answering our
endless questions and requests.

We’d also like to thank Jim Henderson and Russ Motta
tor working with us the night ofwalta to rccrify some unan-
ticipated problems that arose at the last minute. We as stuz
dents are fortunate to have such people with us at Grinnell.
Without these individuals we doubt waltz would have been
as much fun as we hope it was for all who attcndcd,Thank
you again. We appreciate it.

Let’s quit making
FM clean up after
our parties

To the SE13 Staffand Grinnell Student Body,

A number of us on campus are deeply concerned about
what we saw last Monday morning while walking to class: a
member ofthe FM staffcleaning up garbage which had been
strewn all over the Younker beach following a Fridaysnight
party and a post-Waltz party, which had been left there for the
better part of two days.

Apart from our concerns about sanitation and vermin at-
tracted by open garbage, we are troubled by the profound lack
of respect for both FM staff and fellow students that this inc
cident demonstrates. From a student body as high—minded,
engaged and socially aware as Grinncll‘s, one would have ex-
pected considerably more willingness to take responsib ty
for the mess, or at least enough basic courtesy to clean it up.

Admittedly, only a handful of students were responsible
for the garbage outside of Younker. However, the fact that
not a single involved
student stepped for
ward to do something
about it sends the
Grinnell community
a disturbing and hat
curate message about
our student body: that
Grinnell students cans
not behave like mature
and responsible adults,
that Grinnell students
do not care enough to
keep their campus clean; that Grinnell students think othcr
pcoplc should pick up their trash for rhcm.

We do not mean to say, by any means, that Grinnell stun
dents as a whole are irresponsible, destructive and inconsiderv
atc. Nevertheless, incidents like this reﬂect poorly upon all of
us, regardless of whether we contributed to the garbage piles
oursideYounker or nor.Whilc FM stafrarc employed to keep
up the premises and mainrain the buildings we live and work
in, expecting them to clean up our personal garbage, especially
in such large quantities, is both unreasonable and insulring.

Keeping rhe Grinnell campus clean, attractive and livable
is a joint responsibility on the parr ofsrudents, FM staff and
others, and it is disturbing when messes like the one outside
of Younker are left unattended under the belief that students
needn't soil their hands cleaning up the garbage they have
generated. Grinnell’s policy of self—Governance presents a
unique and powerful opportunity for students to take an ac-
tive role in caring for and enriching their community—it is
saddcning when students abuse this privilege, or ignore their
responsibilities altogether.

From astudenthody as high
minded, engaged and socially
aware as Grinneil’s, one would
have expected considerably more
willingness to take responsibility for
the mess, or at least enough basic
courtesy to clean it up.

Sincerely,
Emily Ramiey ‘08, William Dawson '07 and
Shawn Vairt no
