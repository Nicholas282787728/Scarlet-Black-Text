Five students from North Africa and the Middle East enrolled at Grinnell
as part of the Partnership for Learning Undergraduate Studies (PLUS)
program reﬂect on how they got here and their experience so far

BY CATHERINE PIERRO

secondeyear Ahmed Ali’s reasons
for coming to Grinnell college might
not seem different from the typical
students He wants a new experience
that will help him achieve the whole of
his potential in life. But in his case, the
words “experience" and “potential" take
on new meanings.

He is one of five excopriond stue
dents from North Africa or the Middle
East that Grinnell is welcoming this
year in collaboration with the new Parts
ncrship for Learning Undergraduate
Studies (PLUS) program. Ali shares a
common goal with the 70 other PLUS
students assigncd to 11 colltgcs in the
U.S.: “We’re here to tell people about
our culture and to bridge a good rela-
tionship between the stntcs and our
countries."

Ali is from Iraq.
He found out about
the PLUS progmm
only two days before
the application dead:
line.The stressful ap
plication procedure
did not stop him. “This was the op
portunity I was waiting for my whole
life," he said. The AmericasMideast
Educational and Training Services.
Inc. (AMIDEAST) was in charge of
the rclcction process. students needed
to have excellent transcripts following
two years or university study and high
Test of English as n Foreign Language
(TOEFL) scores. Their written per-
sonal statements, recommendations and
interviews were also very important.

“They wanted people who have
leadership potential,"AlisaidAlthough
his concern for academics has kept him
from signing up for any sports at Grins
nell, he was the captain of his soccer
team at home.

Nabila Marzouk ‘08, from Moroce
c0, believes that the interviewers were
looking for “people who speak who

”This was the opportu-

nity I was waiting for

my whole life.”

are not shy."r\rnrzouk is eloquent and
motivated and says she “really wantls]
to work for peace." “I think this way I
would fulfill my not in lifeithe ilim of
this program as well," she said. “When
you tell people what is going on in otlis
er pliices,I think this will help get more
understanding between people."

Each PLUS student has a host
family. Students spent the summer at
preeacademic programs in different
parts of the US, where most studied

‘Isnglish. They will spend two years in

(ht: states, raking extra classes over the
summer to fulfill credit requirements.
The Academy for Educational Devel-
opmcnt manages the program and the
US. Department of States Bureau for
Educational and Cultural Affairs funds
it. When students return to their home
countries, the pro-
grum will help them
to find jobs and will
probably establish
a network between
students, according
to Janet Alexander,
director of Internik
rional Student Affairs.

Students agree that the style of
education here is very different from
what they are used to. Marzouk notes
there is more time for discussion. but
she does not think this means the
quality of education is better. She is
grateful to her excellent professors in
Morocco.

Kholoud IsInssan ‘08, from Egypt,
agrees thar “there are privileges on each
side.The high level ofinformnlity here
sometimes leads to my confusion."

Mounir Belayachi ‘08, from Mo~
rocco, and Fardous Bahbouh ‘08, from
Syria are also here with PLUS. The cols
lege is trying to ensure that the students
adjust well by providing opportunities
for them to interact with one another,
such as regular meetings. “Initially we
were concerned about some of the curl-

tilial issiles that were going to be com-
ing with snidenrs based on other oxpce
riences \ve’ve had.’Y Alexander said.

In Ali’s percoption,“cultural barriers
are not so very prominent." Everyone
who comes here needs time to adjust to
Grinncll. Iowa, he said, and the hardest
part for him was leaving the people he
had met in thc prerncadcmlc program
in Tennessee.

Marzouk attended training sessions
in Morocco where she was told that sub-
jccts such as religion and politics \vcrc
“taboo" in America. She found, to her
surprise. many people at Grinncll love
to talk about thesc things. Hcr training
sessions also taught her Americans are
liberal, but she fccls this is not the case
in comparison to Enropcnn countries
like France and the Netherlands.

While they are here, students hope
not only to gain from being in Amerir
ca, but to give to their American peers.
Manouk is here to “show them what
we are and we what believe in and that
we are really what they think."

Bahbouh mentioned on American
girl who asked her, “Where is Syria?"
When she answered, “Near Iraq,” the
girl asked, “Where is Iraq?"

“I think this a good program." A]-
exander said. “It‘s good for Us; its good
for the students." She feels that it was
rushed this ytar, and hopes “in the fu-
ture ytars rhcyrc going to have more
lead time to got information our to col-
logos and universities so they can have
more people applying."

Mnrzollk, who might major in his
ternational Studies, hopes to work in
an internal organization to resolve con,
ﬂicts. Ali wants to he a university proe
fessor. “[PLUS will] help a lot to spread
ideas among the new generation and
tell them everything about a country,"
he said. “[Most people], if they don’t
want to study it, rhcy want to see it,
and see the people, and see what this
country is."

A day in
the life

, , l5 :

Helyn
Wohlwend
Writing Lab Assistant

6 AIM. Alarm goes off, playing the
Beatles' White Album "Back in the
USSR." I hit the snooze.

6:10 A.M. Beatles’ ”Glass Onion/'1
_ dream about light bulbs shattering.

6:20 AM. "Honeypie." I get out of bed. Thank God for caffeine.
I shower and get dressed.

7 A.M. Time to wake up my specialsneeds lisyedrsold, Andi. She
throws her pillow and a Care Bear at me. She could pitch for the
Meiji

7:15 A.M. I go back into Andi's room for a second attempt. This
time she kicks me in the stomach. I retreat to the living room
for another cup of coffee and to catch the weather forecast.

7:25 AM. I stand in Andi's bedroom door and shout, "Get out of
bed this instant or I will drag you out! We are going to be late
if you don’t get up immediately! You will miss the ﬁeld trip at
school, and you won’t have time for breakfast!" Andi mutters, ”I
hate you.”

7:45 AM. I chase Andi around the house with her clothing
yelling, "Put these on, NOW!"

8:05 AM. Drop Andi at school where, mercifully, I get to leave
her for eight hours. Take Highway 6 out of Newton and head to
Grinnell.

8:35 AM. Score the best parking place, directly in hunt of the
door at ARH. Contemplate walking home to Newton so as to not
have to give it up. Arrive at my office. Make next pot of coffee.
Read email.

8:50 A.M. My ﬁrst appointment arrives early with an art history
paper. We look at questions of clarity, coherence and transitions.

l0 A.M. Student B arrive with a sociology reﬂection paper. She
is over the three page limit by nearly a page. We spend the hour
cutting and clarifying.

ll AM. I see Student C in the waiting area. The four cups of
coffee and two bottles of water are causing a modicum of

distress. so I make an apology, tell him to settle in and run
down the hall.

11:03 AM. Student C pulls out his sociology reﬂection paper.
(Didn’t Ijust do this?) We spend the hour clarifying meanings,
restructuring some paragraphs ‘and smoothing out transitions.

12 PM. Lunch in the office to look at a paper for a student who
is studying in Tanzania this semester. Ijot questions rather than
prescriptive remedies into the paper. I eat my breakmst bar (no
time before), some coconut rice and three miniature candy bars.
I debate the merits of another pot of coffee, but decide that
if my hands start to shake, my students really won’t be able to
read my handwriting.

1:20 P.M. Student D arrives and apologize; for her tardiness. I
hadn’t actually noticed, but whatever. Student D is one of my
”regulars” enrolled in College Writing 100. We brainstorm ideas
for her research paper. We also discuss research strategy.

2:15 P.M. Student E arrives to work on her tutorial paper. It is
her first “academic” paper, and we look at her intro, the flow of
her ideas and her thesis.

3:05 P.M. My older daughter Anne stops to see me, despite her
busy schedule. I read my ”Day in the Life" as far as I've written
it. She gets all thejokes in the account of my morning, but
maybe that’sjust because she knows Andi.

3:15 PM. Student F arrives, another regular, but this is our
ﬁrst meeting. We discuss goals for the semester and upcoming
papers.

4:05 PM. Iwork some more on Student T's project and email it
to Tanzania.

5 P.M. Home. Too tired to cook and with company coming for
dinner, I order delicious Domino’s pizza. Fortunately Shawn and
Sara come to see me, not for my cooking.

9:45 P.M. Shawn and Sara leave, and I put a very cranky Andi
to bed.

10 PM. Foolishly indulge in the CS] marathon on TNT before
turning in.
