consider whether- to allow people to obtain permits to cotr
cetil and carry firearms on public university and college camr
puscs. Currently, Utah is the only state that allows students
and teachers to ‘conccal and carry' firearms on public cam-
puses, but 15 other states including Virginia and Michigan

Iowa Headlines
~ Thomas Newton, the Director of the Iowa Department
of Public mum is facing allegations that his department
misrepresented actors as bartenders and waitresses in recent
antissmoking ads. The charges come from State Senator
Brad Zaun, a republican from Urbandale. zaun is among a
host of Republicans upset about the $600,000 campaign and
told the Des Moines Register early that “I think that was
very misleading and it was very unfortunate.” Newton said
that all six of the people portrayed were genuine bartenders
and waitresses though two also happened to be actors.

The 5&8 Presents .

March 7 2008

Program brings newspapers to campus

Other benefits could include free recycling, journalism workshops and talks

in Dnvll) LOGAN

Thanks to a four wcek pilot program recently negotiated
between the school and USA Today/{students now have access
to free daily issues oleie New YorkTimes,Des Moincs Reg-
ister and USA TodayThe papers are available in four separate
racks in the Spencer Grill, l<istler Science Library creative
Computing Lab and Fireplace Lounge.

According to SGA President Mcgan Gocring ’08, who
helped bring the program to campus, a pri-
mary motivation was to provide students
easy access to more publications, citing an
initiative that passed last semester calling
for a greater diversity of news sources.

“We thought this would be a great way
to stay up to date about the world and get a
variety ofperspccrivcs from different publir
cations,” Goering said

The program also has potential secondary
beneﬁts in addition to increasing diversity of
news sources. Depending on the speciﬁcsof
the school's contract for the program, USA Today may also
place recycling bins next to the newspaper racks and even pick
up the recycled papers free of charge. The three publications
provided at Grinnell may also send journalists and editors to
the Grinnell campus for future workshops or talks.

The program, which began at Pennsylvania state Univer
sity in 1997, includes over 300 different publications and is
administered by the Education Office ofUSA Today.

“USA Today is the quarterback of the program. We take
care or the delivery otthc papers."said Jeffrey Meyer, an Aer
count Manager with USA Today and the company's liaison
for the Grinneil program. “We coordinate the number ofpa-
pets needed."

”I get the 5&8 every Friday but it
doesn’t really tell us aboutituff
outside campus [Ill/S] really
helps us with [ll/5 image that we
are conterned [about the world],”
Chevon Chaiman ’08

Schools may selecr any publication participating in the
program that already delivers to the schools area.

The program's future on campus will depend largely on
student feedback. Meyer said that the company will admin-
ister two sets of surveys about the program and students'
preferences for publications, one ofwhich was completed last
Friday. “We do them to survey the students and try and get
their initial and postspilot programs about the newspapers in

general,” Meyer said. "They're questions
as to what‘s the main source ofyour news,
how often do you read the same newspaper,
since coming to college has your readership
changed or remained the same"

Clievon Charman '08 said that the pros
gram would be a good supplement to al-
ready existing news sources on campus. “1
gct the seal; every Friday, but it doesn't re-
ally tell us about stuff outside campus,” she
said."lt helps us wtth this image that we are
concerned."

Other students, such as Grant Custer '08, said that the
program’s convenience will encourage them to read publica-
tions they otherwise wouldn't see and help them stay better
informed about current events. “[I] feel like I should read
[The New YorkTimes], but don’t usually,"Custer saidt"Mayr
be now I will."

While an official assessment orthc program’s success on
campus won’t be possible until the two surveys are completed,
Goerlng said she has already rcccivcd lots ofinformal positive ,
feedback from students. “I've received more emails in favor
of this program from people that I didn't know than at any
other time during the semester," she said.

Elections

from P- 1 bers but acknowledged that the

poster constituted a violation. “It
sucks that I was reassured by members of Election Board that
it was not a problem," she said. “But, no, it’s valid."

Jeff Sinick '09, ElCCnOn Board member and Films chair,
said that when assessing the legitimacy of grievances, Election
Board has little discretion in interpreting the rules of the Con»
stitution. “We interpret the Constitution very strictly. It is not
Election Board‘s job to interpret or inﬂuence the elections in
any way," he said.

Boeckholt explained the impact of losing official candle
dacy. “[Tlie impact] depends when it happens in the process.
Typically they can't participate in open forums. We also remove
their statements and their name from the ballot," Boeckholt

said. “They don't get any more publicity”

While she has the opportunity to appeal Election Board’s
decision to Joint Board,Morake said she would not do so since
it would unnecessarily drag out the election process, “i doubt
that people would want to do voting nextwcek,"Motake said,

In the races for Vice President ofStudent Affairs and Vice
President of Academic Affairs, John Burrows ’10 and Julie
Hoyc '09 won with 55 percent and 37 percent respectively.

Students can vote in the second presidential election all day
today.
