With .\ new semester, most SCA Cabinets have seen
their budgets changed from last semester, and not all with
changes hoped for.

The overall size of the proposed budget—presented to
Joint Board on Wednesday, which then will be discussed
and voted on in two weeksiincreascd
by 51,533.52 from last semester to
$191,300.29. The increase, however,
was smaller thnn in previous years.

“Generally, spring is more expen—
sive, student groups have their act tar
gethet and they are ready to ink for
funding and there are sports in the
spring that do not exist in fall," said
SGA Treasurer Emily Wax '09.

Last semester's Concerts budget
was $43,000, while this semester it has
been cut by $4,000 to $44,000. Before the budget was one
nounced, Concerts had allocated 838,500 for scheduled con-
certs prior to the semester and expected to have more funds
remaining for equipment and other concerts.

“You can't just adjust and movc around things at the
beginning of the semester,” said Peter Henry ’09, Concerts

to ask formality.”

SGA budget proposed, some budgets fall

chair. “Its almost llmpetublciwc need some money to sit
around to make sure our equipment works because it’s not it
couple orhttle items [and] we still have contractual obliges
trons."

Despite the shift of funds in the budget, Wax said she
believes that Concerts will not be adveisely affected,

“People tend to get comfortable when they
have unlimited funding or perccived to havc
unlimited funding and so stop ﬁnding ways
to spend their money effectively," wrut said.
“Clearly you cannot renegotiate contracts but
you can renegotiate that $11,000 that was in
there for the speakers, for the pnyments of
students, and hospitality, etc,"

The budget for Films increased by 32,500
to $29,500.Accotdlng to SGA Films Coordis
nator chfSinick '09, for SGA to legally show
films on campus they have to buy liccnscs,
which in the past rnngcd from $300 to 3500 per movie. The
larger budget allocation is due to licensing fees going up last
semester to an average of $500 to 8750 per movie. “[The
reason] my hudgct went up so much is betause movies i
thought were going to be soon ended up being much, much
more," Sinick said.

Other budgets that have been affected include ACE and
ACE Security, ACE asked for $30,000 on this semester’s
budget, but was only allocated 527,000 “Spring semester
there are other events that just end up costing more. There
is Disco, Mary E. limes, Block Putty, and Waltz is more cx-
pensive” said Celeste Larkiu ‘11, ACE chair “Ifl don't get
more funding, it’sjust going to require stretching this money
thin."

Also, the budget for ACE Security increased from $5,500
to $8,000 due to the tmining or more employees and the
availability of ACE fol lounge parties.

The Community Service budget went up from $5,000
to 58.000. With the school cutting funds from community
service because of the economy, SGA found enough budget
to allocatemote funds. "Community service is in line with
the goals otoui institution and of SGA. Community service
groups have been unsupported tor severalyeurs fiscally,"Van
said. “I felt at the least We could give them more monetary
support."

Nevertheless, with two Weeks to go before SGA votes on
the budget. some changes can be expected. “There are going
to be some shifts in what we see,"said East Campus Senator
Matt Imher 'llr“But the cuts are not that big and ifneed be
there are ways they can adjust."
