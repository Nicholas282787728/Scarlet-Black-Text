Self-governance in perspective

saltcovcrnancc. i think that's nry favorite phrasc uscd at this
college. Not because I like the concept] do, but that's not ivhy it’s
my favorite Grinncll phrase. No, its my favorite term because it gets
thrown around all the time nd I dont know what it really means, not
do nrany orhcr students, in my opinion.

That the meaning ofself governance is a bit ambiguous
has become increasingly clear in the smoke-rice campus
and substance-{rec dorm issues otthis year _ id last vcar
thn the administration was thrnking about cleats
ing smokcrfree dorms for this year, students protested
numerous tunes and the issue of self-govelnnnce, rhnr
is, students taking responsibility for asking other srur
dents to stop smoking ifthc smokc bothers them, was
brought up at every protest, as well as in multiple Let-
ters to the Editor in this newspaper. Unfortunately,
the pull ofour greater society was too strong and
the campus \vcnt mostly srnokerrrcc this year in
response to the many requests the administration
has recently received. I’m sure the anti-smoking
campaign is mostly to blame for this shift in srut
dent opinion,

once again, the meaning of selrrgovernance is being debated,
although this time in the context of a proposed increase in the num-
ber of substance-free bedsThe sentiment at the recent open forum
seemed to be that students want substance free housing because they
are tired orpayrng ﬁnes when others get drunk and trash their lounge
es.While alegitimatc complarntrn itself, the majority ofanendees at
the forum believe that this is an issue that is best solved by sclfsgoVs
:tnance (students confronting drunk students in their dorms who are
being too loud or creating a mess) and not by a roprdown imposition
of more substancesfree rooms/ﬂoors/dorms/wh:rtever.

Merits of each argument aside, this rells me three things: 1. Stu»
dents generauy'support the idea orsclrgovcrnancc 2. Students have
a partial idca ofwhat sclrrgovernancc is. They realize that it means
they must confront other students who are disturbing them, even
though that type ofconfrontation is hard, but they don‘t necessarily
realize that self-governance also means that you should think beforc
you act and maybe not engage in certain behaviors in the first place
(cg Don't smoke in a nonsmoking dorm, clean up your mess when
you throw a party in someone elsc's lounge, including wiping otrau
the sticky beer from the table) 3. Some students believe that self-
gnvernancc ls being threarcncd,

In random conversations I've had with other students it is clear

that some believe that self—governance died with the instatcmcnr
or the Osgood administration. Unrornrnntcly, l don'r have a broad
enough perspective on this school to decide whether or not i agree,

At any rule. students need a better understanding of what stlft

governance means to this campus at this point in time (any-
body who is in Kesho's class with me knows that all history
is contextual.) 1 think that in order to understand that, we
need to also understand what selﬁgovcrnance has meant
to this campus at other points rn time. So, I decided to

do a little research.

Unfortunately, researching sclrrgovcrnancc is a fair
ly big project. So far I have looked through a few past
student handbooks to ﬁnd the ofﬁcial policy of Self-

Governance. 1 found, among many other things (did

you know that there used to be a ‘I’ct Board' to
decide whether srudcnrs'pcts were legal or not?),
that selfrgovernancc did not appear as an ofhciol
policy until 1969-1970. In the years immediate-
ly prior to that, the handbook mentioned some
things about how the college wanted to cncourr
age students to deal with living problems on their
own, but it did not explicitly mention self-governance.

The 19611970 and 1970-1971 sclfrgovcrnance policies did not
actually use the term selrrgovernrnce. Instead, they listed ‘Students'
Rights Within the Residence Halls.’Essentially, these rights ensured
that students could use their rooms for studying and sleeping at any
time, and for social or recreational purposes or any time, wirh rhe
cooperation orrheir roommates. Students also had the tight to prir
vacy in their room without fear of being intruded upon by a college
official. (This right was an entire paragraph long in the 1969-1970
handbook, interestingly)

This year's handbook has two paragraphs dcscrihing sclragovera
mince at what it means and then a list ofthe ‘Principles ofSclsttn/s
ernance.’1 want list those, but what was interesting to me is that it
explicitly states that ‘The College always reserves the right to imple»
rrrcnr snrdcnr life policies that it believes are in the best interest of
studcnrs.’

1 dont know if this statement was newly inserted for this years
handbook or not, but we need to ﬁgure out why it became necesr
sary to explicitly mention this and whether tlris' is a change from the
original intent orsclr governance. I believe it is a misunderstanding
ofthis statement on boil 1 sides that causes much student frustration
today.

 

 

 

Protest tuition hike

Has Grinncll entered a new Gilded Age?
Whilc top administrators live lavishly, granting
each other pay raise after pay raise, Grinnell stu-
dents are asked to foot the bill for their ﬁnancial
mismanagement.

Including beneﬁts, President Russell K. 05*
good rnadc a stunning 5477,339 annually in
2003 (the last time such ﬁgures were released),

‘ Compared to other college presidents, Osgood

is in a galaxy of his own. According to the Des
Moincs Register, his nearest peer competitor in
Iowa makes less than halfofthat amount.

Osgood, however, represents only a single
link in a broader chain of overpaid administrae
tors. The old boys’ network includes Grinnell
Treasurer David Clay ($344,137), Dean of the
college Jim Swarm ($198,937), Dean of Student
Affairs Tom Crady ($167,275) and Vice Presi-
dent for Development and Alumni Relations
Todd Reding ($167,221).

There was a time when Grinnell administra-
tors were not to overpaid. When Osgood took
the helm in 1999, administrators made only 63
percent or what they do today. That's rightiin
the intervening five years, administrator pay
has Shot up nearly 40 percent, or 7.5 percent
per year. so who has ﬁnanced the old boys' pay
raise? Students, of course. Front 1999—2004, the
comprehensive ice for students rose 30 percent
or 5. 5 percent per year.

Some say the raise is deserved. we are rising
in national rankings and becoming more com-
petitivc with our poor institutions, right? Wrong.
When Osgood became president in 1999, Grins
nell was tied for the 11th spot on the U.S. News
rankings with Davidson CoHcge.Todny, David-
son ranks seventh, while Grinnell ranks 16th.
Perhaps the‘ most ironic thing is that Grinncll
students faced a nruch steeper rise in'compret
hens‘rve fees than their Davidson counterparts
during that time period. If Grinnell is so con-
ccrncd about prestige, maybe we could learn a
lesson from Davidson that higher prices don't
mean higher rankings.

If administrators had better handled the
school's ﬁnances since 1999, Grinnell may he in
a better position todayThc Campus Center Pm,
vides a perfect case study in Gr‘rnnell’s broader
problem of poor decision-making. Rather than
bargain for a good deal, Grinnell decided to dolc
out close to a million dollars (0 big name are
ch‘rtcct Cesar Pelli to merely drrigu the Campus
Center.

Today’s juniors and seniors will never reap
the beneﬁts of higher tuition After all, it will
take more than a year for the gaping hole In the
middle ofcampus to be transformed into a tuner
tional Campus Centet. Until then, we are stuck
with an ugly campus, an unfair meal-equivalency
program, limited workout facilities and make-
shift spaces for student groups. The standard
res (ms: to student complaints that, “it will all
be 1better once the Campus center is here,” does
not resonate with upperclassmcn.

The recent call for another 6.5 percent int
crease in the comprehensive fee is hrndanrenr
tauy misguided, especially when coupled with a
refusal to rap in to Grinncll’s substantial endow-
ment. Grinncll maintains a very conservativc in»
vestment strategy that is unlikely to be subject to
the whims of the market. Moreover, with one of
the top 10-year return rates in the nation, rely-
ing slightly more on the endowment would not
represent a ﬁnancial risk.

Unless students speak out, administrators
will continue to get stiffraiscs and we will con—
tinuc to get shafted. Ifyou feel rhe same, help us
stick it to the crusrccs at today's 2:15 pm. pro—
test in front of the Forum.
