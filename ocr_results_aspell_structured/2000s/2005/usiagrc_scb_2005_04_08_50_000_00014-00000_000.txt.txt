Take constructive action against the tuition hike

Dear Fellow Students,

Many members ofthc student body are confused and rrpset
about the 6.5 percent tuition hike scheduled for next year. Many
ofus have argued with trustees and administrators against this
tuition hike, and some of us feel tlllit the administratols and
trustees have been evasive and unclear in theil justifications for
the decision.

In this kind otcuvrronmcnt, it is impoSe
sible for us to make an effective argument
against the tuition hike, as we are given milk
imal information aborrt where the college’s
money is going,

The majority of information concerns
mg the budget is unavailable to anyone save
a few top atlministlatols. This also makes it
impossible to know how it will affect stri-
dent concerns such as flnan al id and
makes it impossible for us to argtu tlecCSSs
fully against proposed financial policies.

In ordel to have effective input in the budgettmaking pro
cess, it is vital that the administration publish far more infor-
mation, As students. it is our right to be included in making the
decisions that affect student concerns.

Many of the professors here agree that there is too little
student and faculty inclusion in the administration’s decision

Status of activism

Myth #1: There was only one small swasr
Lika.

Stephen Briscoe, the director of Security at
Grinnell, wrote in a campus wrde e-mail: “Swas-

petition that is almost identical to the one beluw.This petition
will prove to administration not only that students ear-e about
budget issues, but also that faculty and students are strongly
united on this from, We will be collecting signatures on thc
following petition outside the dining halls and in flout of the
mail room between April 11 and 15, and we ul ou to suppolt
this initial effort towards increased student
inclusion in the administration's decision
making process,

“We the undersigned students ale dis-
tressed by a lack oftianspaiency on the pair
of trustees and administration concerning
the manner in which the budget for Grins
ucll College rs decided and spcuthbclievc
that it is unjust to demand that students pay
ever—increasing tuition iiltes when students
and faculty are not only essentially excluded
irom the decision making process, but are also deprived ofinr
t‘orruatron concerning the budget.

We therefore demand that, evely fall before the budget for
the following school year is finalized and every spring after all
decisions have been made, Grinnell’s administration publish
and distribute to both faculty and students a report that details
the following in full.

Questioning the
purpose of the library

ltis unreasonable to expect people to form serious opinions about the site plans
for the proposed library modifications on display in Burling in the absence of more
detailed, threeedimensional plans.

But as far as they go, the proposal appears convoluted and distracted, as if it

students would not attend the march—especially
during midsscmsibut it is a fact that racist signs
were made overtly present on Grinnell’s campus.

In addition, we call for a less secretive and more res-porn
sible attitude on the part ofthe administiation and the trustees
concerning all aspects orthc budget, We believe that, because
it is primarily faculty and students who are affected by budget
decisions,we have the right to a nruch greater amount ofincllr
sion in the decision making process, and we believe that it is
lllcxcusillllt fol the financial futiite of Grinnell to be decided
with only the input of an elite few.

We ask that administration announce a plan for fulﬁlling
these demands by April 21, 2005."

Make Grinnell a more
conscientious consumer

Dear campus community,

Numerous items we purchase on a regular basis are manu-
factured by workers in other countries under poor conditions
and low wages. Individuals and institutions have joined the
movement against sweatshops to express discontent with the
violations of basic workers rights that occur. Grinnell College
belongs to this movement. Almost two years ago the College
adopted its Apparel Purchasing Policy in order to ensure that
our buying practices do not promote the existence of sweat
shops. However, the struggle does not end there.While adopts
ing the code was a huge

that he or she thinks the whole incident is stupid
blown out of proportion and the result of hyper-
sensitive jews, it has no more credence than ifa
gentile put forth the same opinion, One person’s
opinion is simply one person's opinion.

Myth #3: That no Grinnell student could
have done this.

Some students have a naive perception ofthe
environment at Grinnell. The rr word is casually
dropped in certain circles. As Jules says in Pit/yr
Fit/loll, “If you want to play the blind man go

“project space," space for ITS’s green and

“advanced tech lab," and a help/residential
netwoik desk. These spaces ha e little or
nothing to do with a college library’s 0“ng
nal mission.

In addition,I notice a worrying lack of
attention to expanding the Library's collect

are being ignorant.
We are far from a perfect environment: still

that the school is satisﬁed with the available intetlibliuy loan servicesThis response
stnrck me as remarkably complacent considering the possibilities the endowment
orrords us. By contrast, why have athletic. dining, and “technology" arcilitics become
such a priority? Is the college trying to become a summer camp rather than an

tive that we ensure its
implementation in all
areas of the College.
Because the Col-
lege does not have a
department that deals
exclusively with all the
purchases done in its
name, it is the duty
ofeach and every one ofus as members orthr community to
help Grinnell College become and maintain itselfas a consci-
entious consumer. For this leason Grinnell Students Against
Sweatshops is organizing a Purchasing Policy Workshop. In
this workshop we will explain what Grinnell’s policy says, how
we have been using it so tar, and what else we can do to fur»

it is now imperative that we ensure

better than we could be, but we have signiﬁcant
room for improvement. 1 have heard people ra-
tionalize that a Grinnell student would never
draw swastikas, because they would be ostracized
ifthey were caught. My response is that whoever
drew the swastikas is not rational.

Myth #4: Political activism is not fun.

Events, such as the march held on the 8th of
February, are also social functions. It's a good way
to meet people that you normally wouldn't, and
you’re hanging out in a my that promotes posi-
tive social change. I found it tun—chatting with
teachers and students and every so orren joining
ill on a chant. Having fun and promoting social
change are not mutually exclusive,

In conclusion: People that don’t acknowledge
that there is a problem are a part or the prob-
lem Whether or not you chose to act is cntircly
separate from the objcctive i‘acts. Discrimination
based upon phy appearance, serrritl orientr

everyone to just be more conscious or how they
play into the hierarchies that operate iii Grinnell
and America today.

Iliopc the next proposal places greater emphasis on books and on creating beauv

from life's many distractions, especially those orthc technological variety.

Books will always remain at the hem of a liberal arts education and any blue
print that suggests otherwise should iaise serious questions about the priorities of

Leave campus bikes alone

The campus bikes are awesome. The yellow sheen, the lowritler handlebar-s,
the wide padded seats... st seeing people ride them makes me and everyone else
happier. And then there re those clutch moments when you rush out ofthe logr
gia, late to class. and see one parked, leaning on its metallic kickstand.

With glee you jump on and swallow the distance between you and the ARH.
That’s why we need to take care of them. Last time we had carrrprrs bikes thev
were inexc ably trashed Let‘s take some pelsmial accountability and take . t
ottlrcsel on mean nracn Take the time to lean it on its kickstand, chastise
someone you see disrespecting one, don't take the scars and, for goodn '
do not ever throw them off the loggia. These twonvlicelers are fantastic, .r
