Those of us who live off campus get i rtrdc
awakening when we react how many things are
no longer included rli our Grinnell bill. Thcle‘s
rent, of course, and food, phone bills, gas bills,
electric bills, toilet paper, Windcx, DrainrO,
Endust, 409, garbage bags, a broom or vacuum
cleaner, Glade plugrins, a ﬁre evtinguisher, fur
nitrite, winter window weatherizer, a shovel,
wine glasses, Glrdware, rugs, curtains,
rca cozics, and so on. These expcnscs
are much more depressing when they
don’t simply appear on a bill listed as _

"Room and Board," but radiel' crush
your sotrl and ravage your wallet on a
dailv basis.

Fear not, gentle reader, as
there are ways to prevent your
othermpus living evpenses
t‘rom overwhelming you and
youi cash flow. Here are some
ways to cut costs:

I) Go ﬁr t/Jt' [rte ﬁnd
Why buy groceries when yotr
can rnooch> There‘s the Community Meal evr
cry Tuesday night. If you bring a Davis Buddy,
you can doggy-bag their meal for your brealofast
and send them home to cat dinner. Hercc oft
ten puts out samples of new or featured foods If
you’re careﬁrl, you can get in your three servings
of fruits and vegetables before that helphil, smil-

ing employee (theres one in every aisle) notices
and asks you to leave. Check out loggia signs

How to make ends meet without room and board

for dctnls, or insti hang around Forum South
Lounge. Ask your on campus frientls about
study breaks, or take a tour of dorm lorrriges on
Sunday through Thuisday nights between eight
and ten, If the SA recognizes that you’re not
from her ﬂoor, claim to be a prospie.
2) New titan Cleaning takes time, and Lyr
sol costs money You’ve already lived in a dorm
for three years, so you're used to ﬁlth and squa-
lorThere's probably nothing in your apartr
ment that gets that dirty, especially since you
won't be cooking (see item 1) When you
absolutely do need to make die place pre-
sentable, mix seven puts water with one part
alcohol (Hawkcyc is fine) in a bowl or
(rf you don’t have dishes) an old two-
litei bottle. Pour it over the slu‘lhce
that needs cleaning and let
stand until it evaporates.
3) Exp/arc alternate
nip/ply liner. There's no
need to buy furniture or
many other household
items. Hang around the orrtampus dumpsters
during the last week of classes, and you will ﬁnd
enough goods and services to outfit ten cmppy
apartments. If you drive around town, you can
often find only slrghtly jankiﬁcd nirnirure sitting
on the curb. Another good source for loquualr
ity apartment needs is the dumpster of any darift
store, I recommend traveling to Des Moincs or
Iowa City to recruit their Goodwill rcjccts.

 

4) Ration livrnritr In order to meet the rent
you may have to trim the fat from your extrrwar
gaut lifestyle, Say goodbye to Charmin Doubler
ply and Colgate Super Whitening Toothpaste
and say hello to sears catalogs and baking soda.

5) Cmm’m clut/v‘i'zi/y Tum oil the lights
when you leave a room In fact, forget about
the lights. During warmer weather, head out to
CERA and ﬁnd some bee hives. Smoke out the
bees (rising lots of cigarette smoke) and harvest
the wax from the lllVCS, Make candles using the
war and tollcdrup rags for wicks. Study by canr
dlcdrght.

e} Andgar, You don't need the heat, so nirn
it otrand pile on more clothes Ityou need more
clothes than you own in order to prevent fl‘ostr
bite, claim extras from campus laundry room
lostrandrfounds.

7) And w/l/ev' Shower in groups. To save on
your water bill, designate one daily (or weekly)
shower time for all your apaitment residents.
This conserves water and also promotes apart-
ment bonding.

e) Ducting-ads. If, despite following the ad
vice outlined above, you find yourself unable to
meet your expenses, you can always try lower
ing your quality of life. Move into an efficiency
apartment with just a cot and some roaches, into
a van down by the cr. ,. railroad tracks, or, ifyou a
truly desperate, say goodbye to the good life and

petition for permission to live olrcampus.

Thank God for creating helpful technophiles

Like many people,I am clueless about tech
nology I have no idea how my computer works-
it just does, kind of like my refrigerator and the
process oi photosynthesis For til 1 know, there
are a bunch of little gnomes erawhng around
my hard drive and pulling on wires.

Normally, I am perfectly happy with my
own ignorance; after all,I don't really know how
my eyes or spleen or anklebones work, but they
have functioned for 21 years now wrthout any
conscious help from me.

However, my computer had something of a
breakdown this past Sunday, possibly because
my Norton Antivirus subscription had run out
sometime last year. Whatever the reason,I spent
most of Sunday afternoon trying to swcctrtalk
the thing into ninetioning. “Good job!" I or
claimed, as it connected itself to the internet.
Unfortunately, the entire system then proceeded
to Crash, shut itself down and make belligcrcnt
buzzing noises,"No no no!"I coaxed. “Don't do
that please. No, stop, NO! That‘s VERY BAD.”
Hearing me talk like this, my roommate Eliza-
beth laughed and commented that I have very
obviously spent a lot of time around children.
AllI have to say is, if my computer were a child,
it was being a real but on Sunday, and I wish it
had parents to pay me for dealing with it.

Luckily, though, there was help available,
You see, when it comes to technologh there
are several types or people in modern world.
First and most uncommon are those people
who really don't need complicated technology
to survive. (At last count, there were about only

several hundred or rhcse people left in the Us,
and most of them were Amish.) Second, and
most common, are the hopeless dependants erc
myself, who don’t understand anything about
machines except the fact that life is a mess
when they don't work. Third, and most useful,
there are the technophiles.Technophiles [we it
when things go wrong. Ifyou hand a tech»
nophile a broken computer he (much as
I hate to reinforce gender stereotypes,
most of the technophiles I know are
male) will get a sort of excited gleam
in his eye and happily spend the next
few hours tinkering with buttons and
fixing everything from your battery
to your virus definitions to the fact
that somehow, somewhere, there
might still be few square feet of
space that do rrot have wireless
internct access.

Ofcoursc, as much as]
make fun of technophiles,
I need them. After all, you
never know when you might get an offer for a
super low interest rate on a house, an int
to join the military or maybe even an ad t
natural penis and breast enlargement.

Luckily, my dad is .r technophile, as is
Elizabeth's boyfriend David (aka the SQYI)’
photo editor), Between the two or them, my
computer received about thirtyrfrvc sepamte
anti-virus programs and updates. Every inch
ofir was inspected and scanned for everything
from the Sasser worm to mono, and everything

that was found was immediately attacked. I was
tempted to finish offthe process by hauling the
poor thing into the health center for ibuprofen,
cough drops, and maybe even a ﬂu shot yusr to
protect against future infection,

Unfoinrnately by Monday afternoon my
computer was still rrot quite itself Of course, it

had stopped buz7ing at me, and it wasn't ranr

domly shutting ol'rnearly as often, but it did

get very upset and cranky whenever I tried

to check my email. In fact, it didn’t seem

to want to let me check my email at all,

and a large portion ot the interner had

become suddenly inaccessible. Finally,

I began to realize that overloading

on anti-virus software had turned

my brattyrchrld computer into an

cxccssixcly overprotective pair

cnt,resrrrcting me from doing

pretty much anything at

all, (“No Emily' No bad!

Don't check your crnarl, it

might have germsl") Also,

I’m not sure ifl have any viruses left or not.

This time around, even the technophiles are
stumped.

In conclusion, I'm left wontleiing one thing:
I’ve licard that there used to be Amish people
livi g in the Amana Colonies. Does anyone
know ifthcy are still there? Ifso,I think I might
drive down andioin them.

Oh wait- I don‘t know how to drive a car.
Danni.

Letters to
the Editor

Don't change
rabbi position

Dear Editor,

Rabbi Deborah Brill will be leaving her posit
tion as the Associate Chaplain at the end of this
academic year, While we are saddened that we
will lose Rabbi Erin’s guidance and support, we
wish her the best in her future endeavors and are
grateful for the contributions she has made to the
Gtinnell community and especially to the Grin-
nell Jewish community.

\Ne ire concerned, however, about the hum:
of not lylcwisb life on campus, but also camr
pus rehgn‘ous life as a whole. Over the past week,
we have met with both Vice President Crady and
President Osgood regarding the hirure ofRabbi
Erin's soon-tube vacant positlon. Both have
expressed their support for our desire to have a
rabbi on campus and have assured us that they
Will work to make it happen. We appreciate this
support, but based on on conversations, we are
eoneenred that the nature of the position will
be detrimental, Both Crady and Osgood have
indicated that the new rabbi might not be the
Associate Chaplain, and they have suggested
that the position otAssociate Chaplain might be
eluninared altogether.

Over the last several years, Grinnell's rel.i~
grous community has grown substantially We
believe that the Chaplin's omce rs responsible
for this growth. The program that Chaplain
Deanna Shotb and Associate Chaplain Brin
have built, with the help of Lilly Interns, offers
students from a varietyof religious backgrounds
the opportunity to explore their spirituality in
a way that might not otherwise be possible in
smallrtown America. We fear that eliminating
the position of Associate Chaplain would make
it difﬁcult to maintain this programming at its
current level. In addition, having a rabbi afﬁliated
with the Chaplarn’s Ofﬁce, who therefore advises
rtonrJewish religious groups as well as Jewish
students, helps promote interfaith dialogue at a
time when it is becoming increasingly necessary
for groups to put aside ditl‘erences and work to
gether.

We are writing now because time is of the
essence. We are in the midst oftlae hiring season
for rabbis, and we feel that in order to get the beat
person possible for the job, the College must act
soon. As ofMareh 1, tl , college had not posted
ajob Listing. The adminisbmtion tells us that the
position is being reevaluated and will be posted
once a ﬁnal position description has been written
and appioved. We do not understand why this
reevaluation is necessary As the saying goes, “If
it ain't broke, don't fix it.”

Fat fuck squirrels need to die

The squirrels at Council are n slothenly mass ofoverfed
inugnvups. Anyone who has seen the large masses of red-
dishrbrown ﬂab dragging themselves between mounds of
food, as I have, would have notice a toy key things, Recent—
ly, a quintet ofthe loafers were gorgirrg themselves on nuts
and seeds only a millimeter from where I passed, and they
didn’t ercn acknowledge my aristence, let alone disperse.
These ubcr'-squirrcls have successﬁrlly removed themselves
from the evolutionary chain otdeiclopment. In addition,
the weather has been etcredingly warm recently because
Joe America feels the need to drive a tricked—out Humv
trier H2 to pick up his loser sort from soccer practice.Thus,
the squinels, who had been tittening tip for a harsh winter,
got a touch 0’ die tropics instead ofOld Man Winter, The
squirrels oturban jungle deal with the harsh re. ties ofeais,
kids and squirrel-proof bird-feeders, on a daily basis. City
squirrels have ninja cunning whereas our squirrels look like
Fat Albert and the Junkyard gang Solution? Start putting
the fear of god back into these plumpcis. In my mind the
only good squirrel is a terriﬁed one.

Don’t criticize Dining Services

Wednesday s Earth Day dinner was prooftliat any
~cr 'srn directed towards Grinnclls cooking stiffis
misplaced. When given the opportunity, they can
produce a healthy, delicious meal worth the moneyive
pay to eat it. It is a disservice to the college's workers
to expect high—quality meals on a regular basis when
highrqlrali ngredicnts are rarely available out of
respect to everyone who prepares or cats dining hall
food, Grinnell College needs to make a commitment
to provide high-quality ingredients on a regular ba—

April fools? We are!

How cruel of this administration to rob us of
that one glorious day, the first of April, on which
we would annov the hell out of well, everybody so
muiy plans 1 hard laid, no longer teasble due to the
cowardice of Them" Theer scared. They know
what Grinnell would turn into on April 1st if every—
body was here. Oh, how well they know what would
follow. The pilfering ofgood riiends'undergarments
(with prominent display iir sufficiently embarrassing
locales), the plastering of posters across campus with
compromising pictures pasted upon them. the list
just goes on and on. Perhaps even going as far as to
tie the conveniently inward swinging dorm doors to
their partners across the hall, so that none may leave
their room Sure, its a ﬁre hazard, but since when
has such insignificant things gotten iii thcway? Grow
