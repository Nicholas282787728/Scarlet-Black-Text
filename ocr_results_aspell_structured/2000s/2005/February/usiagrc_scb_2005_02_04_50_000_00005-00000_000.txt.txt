ness to centuries of religious and ethnic
tensions. For alumnus Geoff Swenson
‘03, it thus promises to provide a rich
opportunity to pursue graduate study, in
comparative ethnic conﬂicts at Qieen's
University.

Geoff swenson '03 has recently
been awarded one of the 12 George J.
Mitchell Scholarships annually granted
to American students for the pursuit of
graduate studies in Ireland. Thrs year,
there were 220 applicants from 166
universities.

Durrng his time at Grinncll, chm

international. Swenson deferred admis-
sion to the Stanford Law School in
order to pursue a Junior Fellowship for
research at rhe Carnegie Endowment
in the Democracy Program

He currently
works in Washington
DC. at the National
Democratic Institute
as a program assistant
for the development
of political parties in
the world's emerging
democracies,

“We work in B07
livia, Pakistan and everywhere in her
tween."said Swanson.

chnson anticipates that his even-
tual career will be in international af-
fairs.

chnson is enthusiastically looking
forward to this study, he said.

According to the USrIreland Alli-
ance Organization that sponsors (hes

from around the nation and “exhibit sue
perior levels of academic achievement,
leadership and community service."

essays and two interviews,

campus environment to be inspirrng,
especially his interactions with Presi-

Life stories

First winter altbreak volun'teers at rehab cen-
ter and women’s halfway house

By BEN WEVL

During the lengthy wrrr rcr break, seven Gtinnellians found some
time to help out. Laura Matter-‘05 and Ursula Hill ‘05 led a six
day alternative break in Des Moincs; it is the first alternative wuiter
break Grinncll has had according to Community Service Center
Coordinator Amy craves

originally the group planned on volunteering at the womens
prison in Mitchellville, Iowa, but due to scheduling problems, the
group was unable to complete the necessary training, and instead
engaged in several different projects,

In addition to working at a soup kitchen and making about 10
gallons of ehrlr, the group volunteered at a drug and alcohol rclrae
bilitatioii center and a women’s halfway house. According to Matter,
they led writing workshops for two days at the rehabilitation cen-
ter, “The man who led [the Center] basically gave us his group for
two days," she said. “One of the steps in the treatment is to write a
life story, so we did writing exercises with the group to get people
loosened up about writing about themselves.”The writing activities
were successful, Matter said. “People were just really open in talking
about their struggles with addiction. I was surprised that they were
so willing to accept us and not shut us out as people who were com,
ing for two sessions."

Hill agreed with Matters assessment. “The writing exercises
went really well I think. We did a lot of sharing and it was really
cool to hear peoples responses to one another and to hear their stos
ries, she said, although she
agrccd that it was not easy for —,

ship “I did not feel alienated, .
but it was deﬁnitely hard to was surprised that they were so
willing to attepl US and nolshut us

come in as a group of seven
college kids and work with _
out as people who were taming for
lwoseisl'ons.”

a lot of people, mosdy who
were there for probation and
parole, so we didn't have that
connection like, ‘oh you went
to Grinnell college, but 1
had some really wood con—
versations wrth people after class about whar they were doing and
we also had a really nice talk with the whole staff"

Other participants included Sarah Mirk ‘08, Monica UgWi ‘08,
Cid Standifer ‘07, Brigham Hoegh ‘08 and NickTimmer‘OS.“Peor
ple were really good about writing personal sniff," said Timmer. “1
think itwas because they are used to sharing very personal things at
AA meetings. we were surprised for the most part at how willing
people were to share in general" ,

The group also spent two evenings at a women's halfway house
in Des Moines,where they split up into three groups and led work-
shops ou poetry, current events and cartooning. Hill and Timmer
helped to lead the cartooning activity. “We really connected with
one ofthe women there through talking about our lives and draw-
ing about our lives," Hill saidTimmet agreed, “It was good. I think
drawing helps people remember their childhood and it awakens
those memories."Timmer did not find it hard to relate to the resir
dents, he said.“They'rs just people who have had hard lives.

Matter, along with Hill and other Grinnell students, has led
writing workshops at the men’s medium security prison in Newton,
but said that discussing poetry with women was a new experience
for her. “It was fun to talk about poems with women because finally
we could talk about relationships and sexual things in poems that
would have been awkward conversations to have in a men's prison
and resonated a lor more quickly in a women's halfway house, and
that was exciting."

Hill and Matter, having volunteered at the Newton prison, led
the trip in order to learn more ahout the penal system. “we've been
interested in researching the different aspects of the penal system,
and we were talking about how we had only seen prisoners, people
currently serving thcir term. and we didn’t have much ofn concept of
what happened after that, what the rccrrrry programs were Like, what
a halfway house environment was like, what it's like to be trying to
get reestablished in the job world."

Hill was pleased with the trip and stressed her desire for Grins
nell's continued action.“l think it turned out really well,"she said.“I
really would like to see three different offshoots ofthe trip: that the
people on the trip continue to be involved with prison work, thntwe
continue to do winter alt-breaks, and that we foster our connections
with the Des Moines volunteer and service community."
