Marijuana discovered in Grin-
nell College post office leads
to Class D felony charges

by DAVID ARCHER

Last week the Poweshiek County District Court
issued a warrant for the driest of William Bruns
‘08 ofBainbridge,V\’asli,, who had ﬂed the state to
woid felony charges for the delivery of marijuana
Wednesday, Bruns negotiated a surrender through
his lawyer and agreed” to turn himself in in Iowa
sometime in the next three weeks, when he will be
taken into custody and arraigned. There the court
will discuss his charges and his conditions for its
lease, the Grinnell Police Department said.

An officer familiar with drug investigations said
it was unlikely that a first conviction for a class D
felony would carry prison rimc The officer added
that federal charges may still be pressed, but that
state prosecutors are currently handling the case,

The state pressed charges on suspicion that
lit-tins delivered marijuana through the US Postal
Service, the police said.

The investigation began on Jan, 20, when the
Grinnell College Post Ofﬁce informed the Grinncll
Police department of a “suspicious" package that
emitted a “pungent odor of raw marijuana.” The
police department used a certiﬁed canine from the
Poweshiek County Sheriff’s Office to determine
that the substance was likely marijuana, and then
solicited US Postal Service Inspectors, the Jasper/
Poweshiek/Pella Drug Taskforce. and the Grinnell
College Security Department to assist the investit
gation.

on Jan. 25, the Drug Tasltforce used a search
warrant to search Bruns’East Hall room,where they
did not find more marijuana, but did turn up evit
dencc that implicated him in the delivery of drugs
through the postal service.

Bruns is no longer enrolled in the college, and
the administration would not comment on his
whereabouts or the reason for his leave.

Bruns had apparently left Iowa before law en-
forcement agents obtained the search warranr or the
subsequent arrest warrant,

The crime is punishable by a prison sentence
not to exceed five years and or a fine not to exceed
57500, the police report said. The bond for the Mr
rest is 39750.

Unpacking the legalities of
police presence on campus

by DAVlD ARCHER

The perimeter ofcampus is not protected by a meat or wall, but,
perhaps in part because of the college's legal status, students often
not under the assumption that an invisible barrier prohibits police
from entering campus.

College policy implicitly permits police to patrol campus, and
even walk through residence halls without probable cause, but dorm
rooms remain within a sphere of privacy that requires distinct but
complex conditions for ofﬁcers to search. While police usually need
a warrant to search a student room, the college can also give the
police this permission.

President Russell K, Osgood called the law that concerns where
and how the police patrol and search the campus one of the “most
complicated sets oflaw."“1t's a law of reasonableness," he said, CX’
plaining that the protection of privacy rights comes in shades and
degrees rather than clear and absolute categories,

Osgood, a lawyer by training and a former dean of Cornell
Law School, agreed that although the campus is technically private
property it functions as a qtrasi~public space, permitting access to all
members ofrhe greater community, including police othcers

Police ofﬁcers may legally patrol campus, and occasionally do
so on foot and bike, according to the police department, And the
quasi-public space extends to dormitory hallways, which ofhcers
may enter without a wairant,Tom Crady, vice president for student
life, said, “We've had a longstanding policy that allows police to walk
the halls," Crady said.

crady added that he is unaware of a time when police entered
dorms on casual patrols, withour probable cause, which Osgood de-
fined as the reasonable belicfofa police ofﬁcer that a crime has been
committed,

Ifa college does not have an open campus, it has more power to
restrict police visits. osgood cited Yale University as a school that
requires all visitors to check in or be accompanied by a visitor to
walk around their 12 residential colleges, which house undergradUr

CORRECI’IONS...
- A Feb. 4 article reported Joe Rosenﬁeld’s year of graduation
as 1921; however, he graduated in 1925.
' A Feb. 4 article said the Grinnell City Post Ofﬁce received a
suspicious package containing marijuana, however, it was the
Grinnell College Post Ofﬁce that received the packagecalled
the police department.

The article referred to the Jasper/Poweshiek County Drug
Taskforce, the organization's complete title, however, is the

ates.

Even if colleges restrict access, police can enter campus space
under certain conditionsThe police can enter a dorm room if they
are in hot pursuit ofa suspect. have obtained a search warrant or ifa
student consents to a search,

The police may also search a students dorm room ifthc college's
administration consents. Osgood said crady would be rhe adminis-
trator responsible for giving the pollcc consent to search a students
room, although Crady said he would only consent ifrhc police had
obtained a warrant.

The college may give the police consent to seaiclr a student’s
room against the wishes of the student under the housing license
that students living on campus are rcquIrcd to sign, Osgood said.
Unlike a lease, under which a property owner cannot give police
permission to search, the housing lease does not give the student
the exclusive right to use or occupy their iooni, thus allowing the
college more control.

college scarf may also search a room without a warrant or no-
tice if college staff “reasonably rear harm to life, safety. health, or
property, according to page 90 of the Student Handbook. In these
circumstances, the college may confiscate contraband In plain view
ofthe staff, even iftlris was not the original reason for entry.

Colleges rights to allow police into student rooms under hous-
ing licenses have not gone unchallenged. Courts have held that
“mere ownership of the dormitory does not give a university the
tight to delegate its authority to police where the primary purpose
of the search is criminal prosecution," according to a comment in
the Fall 1998 University ofChicago Law Review.

The comment cites the Michigan federal district court case
Smyth v. Lubbers, which argued that college officials may not give
third party consent “if [the] search for drugs had no educational
purpose."

Osgood expressed doubt over the possibility of the case applying
to Grinnell. “A law review article is merely the opinion ofthe author
and not authoritative as to the legal issue," he said. “A district court
decision in Michiyn is generauy not binding in Iowa."

simply maneuvered around them.

However, the police informed them
that obstructing traffic was an illegal
offense and asked them to move off the
road. The students complied and the
ones who did not slip away into cent
tral campus gave their names to a police
officer while Dali Holman remained
filming the scene out his window.

In Grinnell College's long protest
tradition, this standtoff is unique in its
spontaneity. “I‘m pro—choice, but I'm
not militant pro-choice,” said Patter-
son. Vthit moiicd her to action was the
“insulting" nature of the van, “When
they rise completelv untrue facts about
breast cancer, i - Just lies,” she said.
“They're just lr/ g to scare people."

The M' ties to the PrerBorn
hope to invoke an intense reaction.
They describe the van as “Inryoilrrface
baby-rnurder”and the group’s tactics are
meant to “prick the conscious"ofGrins
nell students, the two Wrote, “Some of
Grinnell's students have had abortions.
Others have actively or passively cori-
tributed to a death... deep down they
know it is wrong,"

Graphic images of aborted fetuses
arc often used for the plorliit: cause be
cause they present a gruesome reality.
Catharine Geddcs ‘06, one of the lead»

ers of the campus ProtLife group, put
it this way: “I‘m sure no one thinks that
abortion is pretty, but probably a lor of
people never want to think about how
gross it really is," Geddes emphasized
that she was expressing her own opint
ions, not those ofthe group.

However, rnrsusage or such volatile
images can also have negative reperwSr
sions, as Geddes explained, “I think the
vans are most concerned with shocking
people into disgust... I think we made
a lot ofhcadway with the student bodv
by presenting nontstercotypical and
educated speakers . By inundating the
campus with gruesome pictures, any
positive sentiment towards the protlife
cause has bccn eradicated,"

Although Patterson feels that pro
choiccrs and p. lifcrs “can peacefully
exist as long as they don't call us baby
killers." the Missionaries to the Free
Born contend that they “do not con,
sider them pro—choice, they are pro
abortion."

This polarized issue may only he-
come exacerbated in coming months
“We realize that we have neglected
Grinncll and plan to add it to our busy
schedule," especially when the weather
gets warm, wrotc the Missionaries in
their email.
