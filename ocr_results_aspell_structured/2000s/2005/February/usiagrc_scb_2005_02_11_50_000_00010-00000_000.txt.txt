Thrifting away

February I I, 2005

union r.

Kyle Tomsha '08 has
visited thrift stores in
six states. An expert at
wearing other people’s
clothes, he discusses
the beneﬁts and draw-
backs of thrift store
shopping.

Why shop of thrift
stores instead afmore
upscale retailers?
Because the clothes
are cheap and the stuff
is weird: last semester
I bought a goldrlaced
poinsettia christmas
sweater and white
Michael Jackson pants.
Each thrift store is like
a magical place, hold-
ing buried treasure and
unexpected hysteric
madness.

Do you ever feel
strange wearing other
people’s clothes? Do
you ever feel any con-
nection to them?

No, and no Except

for one time when I
was ﬂipping though a
science textbook and
saw the guy wearing
the exact same striped
T»shirl. He looked like
that crazy teacher from
Stand and Deliver. I like
to dream we were wear»
ing the same shirt.

What is the cool-

est thing you’ve Ever
bought?

The (asiotnne 100»01,
hands down. I saw the
dusty keys underneath
a copy at Oregon Trail
and a pile of boxers.
Sunlight streamed in
though the windows
and coalesced on the
brilliance of the drum
machine stop/start
button.

How do you shop? 00
you have a plan when
you go in?

Ialways have a plan
when I go in. I know
what I’m looking for
and I scavenge ierally
until I obtain it. After
thatI kind ofjaunt
though the winter
coats, the sweaters and
the long sleeve shirts.
In that order, always.
A new obsession l
have is keyboards that
cost $10 or less

Why doesn’t every one
shop at thrift stores?
Dignity? Misplaced self-
respect? 1 think mostly
social taboos. [Thrift
stores] are stereotypi-
cally for people who
don't have money to
pay for new clothes,
[so] they seem unre-
spectable, Also, thrift
stores are grimy,
and you feel kind of
nauseous when you
leave, Like the feeling
or being stuck on a
tire swing [when] your
sadistic friends won’t
let you off. Don’t let
that discourage you,
though. 754mm Mirk

Need some Action-Packed Gospel, a truck stop
belt, $5 keyboards or satin dresses? The 5&3

reviews local thrift and consignment Stores
By SARAH MlRK AND REBECCA TAvLoR

Goodwill

The Ghnnell Goodwill claims to have "New
items dailyl" and, indeed, proffers the largest
selection in town. There are so many clothes here
that you are bound to rind wearable stunin many
sizes,

Goodwill seems very coordinated, with the well-
signed layout lending a professional air to the
store. The tile ﬂoor and neutral smell differ from
other thritl Stores. but items still maintain the
feeling or having past lives. Worn-in purses hang
rrom a sad metal arm, and the plentiful supply of
used boxers is folded and neatly shelved.

Many of the women's clothes seem like they
may have come out of a 19805 country music
video—think tiny blue flowers and yellow ging-
ham—and a great quantity seem to have been
donated by elderly kindergarten teachers.

There is also an abnormally large selection
of bulky sweaters remnant of gifts received,
unwanted, rrorn grandmothers long ago. A whole
area is devoted to "one piece outﬁts," i.e. overalls
and shortallsa

Several gigantic purple satin dresses make up
themajorily urthe small formal wear rack, but
most all would require major altering or supreme
self-confidence before becoming the sexy stuff of
Waltz entrance dreams.

A red suitcase, a beach chair, Batman, E. , a
Small Soldiers plastic cups Set and Action dcked
Gospel (threervideo set only $6.99!) were some of
the treasures found piled in the ample accessories
corner.

Second Mile

Second Mile is a veritable cornucopia of
treasures Founded by a minister who decrded
that things needed to be recycled to help the
poor, the store initially gave merchandise to the
needy for free. Eventually, Second Mile began to
scan charging a small price, providing "charity
with dignity.” All the store’s proﬁts go to local
charities.

Joan Bayless. director since 1986, is very
friendly. She takes helping people seriously,
and will outfit entire apartments with supplies
or fill children's backpacks for school. “The
people that need clothes get 'em free,” anless
explained.

what about thrifty college students? Grinnel»
lians can pay amazingly low prices for clothes
and homeware (lamps, awesome mugs, small
tables, etc). For those crafty students, Second
Mile also offers a table full of fabrics, buttons.
zippers and sewing supplies.

rhe store has a very homey, haywire feel,
with everything squished madly togetherwfor
example, a ”GOD BLESS THE USA" curtain covers
the kitchen things. The volunteer staff tries to
keep up with donations that come in "every 10
minutes at the back door."

The frequent donations and rather inconver
nient hours mean that the store is not as picked
over as Goodwill and hps some great finds. Amid
the random odds and ends that make up the ma
jority of the store's haphazard layout is a must
see stash of retro toys, including an Easy—Bake
Oven and a basket oi trolls.

Rugs and Riches

This consignment store has much more of a den
parlment store ambiance than the thrift stores in
town. There are mannequins in the window (just
like those stores at the mall!) and a very orga»
nized layout—this store obviously isn’t trying to
cram bags full of backdoor donations onto limited
shelf space.

Unfortunately, the slightly department store feel
coincides with slightly department store prices.
For example, one of the copious numbers of sweat
er vests on sale will set you back a whole is.

Most of the store's merchandise falls into the
”decadent 19705" genre and is geared much more
toward women than men There are several display
cases rull or jewelry and beauty products. This fe-
male orientation also Ineans the store has a lot of
grandmotherly nightgowns and none of the ironic
short-sleeved shim alternative indie kids crave.

0n the plus side, the women's formal wear
section at Rags and Riches is the best in town,
boasting 24 Waltziworthy dresses ranging from
a reasonably stylish 38 piece to a $160 wedding
dress and Veil.

Hot ﬁnd of the Store: along the back wall, there
is a small but awesome collection of "sweet” vine
tagc suits.
