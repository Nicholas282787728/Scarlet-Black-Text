Long-range EKI considers increasing
tenure-track faculty, other proposals

Expanding Knowledge Initiative includes plans to increase faculty diversity, expand inter-
disciplinary study and potentially institute a sophomore retreat

BY CAITLIN CARMoDv
On Monday, faculty met in focus groups
to discuss the Expanding Knowledge Inrtia-
tive (EKI), a proposal that would expand in
terdisciplinary studies, increase diversity, and
decrease reliance on shirt-term hiring.

EKl's six members (Stephen Andrews,
Todd Armstrong, Victoria Brown, Clark Linda
grea, Wayne Moyer and Marci sorter), were
appointed by the Executive Committee. Two
years ago, the Board ofTrustees requested that
the college think about where it was headed
in the next ten years, and the result was four
commrttees to examine different aspects orthc
Griiinell educational experience, one of which
was the Committee to Reaftirm the Liberal
Arts. From this came the EKI committee.

The EKI committee initially considered
moving Grinnell towards being very strong in
one academic area, but quickly realized that
this wasn’t consistent with the college’s ideals.

“The more we looked at it, the more we
saw we had strengths spread out across a large
discipliiiaiy range, so we didn't want to [move
towards pr-crptoressionalisnr], We wanted stu—
dents to have opportunities in a lot oratctrs,"
said Marci Sortoi, Associate Dean ofthe Col~
loge and member oftlie EKI committee.

For the proposal to be implemented, it
requires the approval or both the faculty and
the Board ofTriistecs. For now, the committee
is presenting hroad suggestions ror achieving
its stated goals.

“Change can he good, but it's always
fraught with a sense that something might be
lost, so the proposal builds in oil 'v step the
possibility of faculty and strident input,"Todd

Armstrong, Russian professor and mernher or

the EKI Commlrrccr

Addin tenure-
track acuity

To decrease the number
of sliortttcrrn professors
teaching at Grinnell, the
committee is proposing that
twelve new faculty members ‘

“We lose touch with

shape their four year plans, and that they can

and member ofthc EKI committee said.

increasing faculty diversity

This increase in faculty would allow for
profess to he hired whose focus may be on
interdis rplinar-y suhiects and who would di-
versify both the rrtcrrlty and errrriculrn.

When you expand the faculty, you expand
the possibility of bringing
faculty ora diverse hacks
ground. We can also ad
dress diversity in terms or
curriculm, because inter-
diseiplinarity' is inherently
diverse, lirrnstrongsard.

'lhis increase in fac-
ulty would also free up
professors to teach inter
disciplinary courses that
they otherwrsc would not
be able to. New laculty
could teach survey courses,
allowing senior faculty to
reach more special' ed courses.

Delegation elicits support
from members of Congress
for Poweshiek business de-
velopment

By BEN WEVL

on Tuesday, Feb. 8, the Poweshiek lowa
Development Group, known as POW It80,
took a tworday trip to Washington, Dc. to
talk with Iowa's congressional delegation. The
group was formed around June 2004, accord-
ing to theatre protessor Sandy Moffett, who
serves as Poweshiek County Supervisor and
chart ofPOW 1780 POW 1780 was formed to
encourage business development throughout
the county and help grow rural communities.

on Wednesday, the Development Group
met with Congressman Leonard Boswell (D)
and ScriatorTom Harkiri (D).They also spoke
to Senator Chuck Grassley (R ) on speaker
phone and met with members ofliis staﬂ.

on Thursday, Feb 10, the Development
Group met with congressmanJirn Nusslc (R).
Nussle does not represent Poweshiek County,
but since “he is interested in running for (3on
ernor, we ﬁgured he might be interested in
talking to us," Moffctt said with a smile

One of the Development Group's main
priorities is intprovrng the infrastructure of
the exit from Interstate 80 to Highway 146
and making the entrance to Grinrrell more at-
tractive, Moffctt said. Last year’s highway bill
would have granted si million forlandscaping
and other development, but the bill was nevei
voted on.

“It will hopefully "er passed in the new
transportatron bill," Moflett said. Boswell,
who inserted the amendment last year, said he
would do so again and both senators agreed
to support it.

The Development Group also inquired
about support for a three—building Iowa
Transportation Museum to be built in Gr-in-
nell. The first building, a historical museum,
would call attention to the automobile history
of Iowa. Between 1910 and 1915, spalding
Automobiles manufactured 1481 cars in Grins
nell. Only one car now remains. and it is to be
preserved in the Giinnell museum.

The second building would be an archive
center, and the third building would be a car
restoration center where people could watch
the process of car restoration. Ivlofi'ett called
it “a fairly ambitious and interesting idea. He
said that' it is an 818 million proiect, and so fir
the Group has helped raise nearly 32 million.
The Congressmen gave their support for the
