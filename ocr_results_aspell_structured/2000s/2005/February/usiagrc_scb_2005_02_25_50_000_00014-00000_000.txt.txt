Sometime between 2 and 4 a.m.
on the moIIung of Thursday, Feb. 24,
.\ vandal broke into the college book
store by breaking the inside and outside
doors. The perpetrator scattered Sweet
Tarts and DVD ROMs inside and out»
side the store, according to bookstore
assistant manager Harley MCIlmtl’t.

The inventory was short some
DVD ROMS, he said, but no offices
were broken into. “It makes us think it
was just something to do. More like a
prank rhan a robbery,"

In the last two weeks, Security has
reported several other incidents afvan-
dalism, including two broken windows
in the Forum and the removal ofa mes
moIiul Sign.

on Sunday, Feb. 27, security re-
ceived a report rhat the window to
Dean ofSrudent Lifelcn Krohn's ofﬁce
had been broken with a brick. Sources
indicated that the brick had been taken
from outside the south campus loggia
between Haines and James, said Brier
coe.
The window cost about $1000 to
replace, according to Steve Briscoe, die

The same night, the rope on the
central carnprrs ﬂagpole was cut, and a
memorial sign near the flagpole was Ice
movedtThc slgn, which honored Doris
J. chgctt, was found near the Forum.

About 72 hours later, another win-
dow in the Forum was broken, this
time a door to the Fonnn Grill. The
door “looked like somebody kicked or
hit the glass and broke it,"Brrscoe said.

Briscoe said he doesn’t know if the
recent acts ofvandalism are related.

Though Briscoe didn’t know if
Crime on campus has been higher than
in other years, his decision to release an
email alert bulletin on Sunday indicates
his sense that recent Crime merits CaUr
tionr

“When I start getting a lot of these
incidents, that’s when I start sending
these out," said Briscoe. “When certain
things occur that could be a danger to
the college or the people in the college,
I’m required by federal law to contact
the campus and let them know what's
going on."

The bulletin listed the theft of two
computers and the vandalism of {our
cars on campus among crimes reported
since the beginning ofzoos.

Library Planning
Committee asks for
community input

or ALY BEERV AND LINN DAVIS

The fourth and ﬁnal Burling Lia
brary planning scssion was held today
at noon in ARH 102.

The Library Planning Committee
sponsored these sessions as a way to
elicit concerns, opinions and suggCSr
rions about Burling from faculty, staff
and students and look towards long-
terrn library planning. The committee
includes representatives from lnformur
tion Technology Services (ITS), Burls
ing Library and other faculty members
and administrators.

At the first session, three nonrcomr
mince members attended, and six are
tended the third session.

Thcre are no plans to tear down
Burling, committee members said,
though the committee is looking at
ways to potentially add more space to
the Brrrling building so that it could
house ITS and mate shelrspace.

According to Marci sorror, associr

arc dean otrhe college,"Thls particular
phasc, working out a master plan for
the library as a space for the library as
well as ITS, all started with a prelimi-
nary meeting in rhe till."

At both last Thursday's and Timer
day's meetings, the idea of moving ITS
to the library was met with approval by
those at the Session Gail Bonath, l‘r-
brarian, said that having ITS under the
same roofwould enable information to
reach the college community more efr
frcrently.

Attendees also discussed the need
tor more small group study space in a
revarnpcd burling, and some considr
cred the idea of adding a cafe area.

Most of the participants in the ses-
sion were positive about Brrrling's cur-
rent facilities, saying that it was com
fortable, offered options in terms of
work environment and had good light-

ing.
