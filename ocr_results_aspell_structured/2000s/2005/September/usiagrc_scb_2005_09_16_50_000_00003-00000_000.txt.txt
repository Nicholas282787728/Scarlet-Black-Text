The Rosenfield Symposium “US. Media, Governs
ment and Politics" brought several welleknown jonre
nalists to Grinnell's campus this week. Among them
is the accomplished Jurek Martin, former Washing-
ton Bureau Chief of Tb: Financial Timex, winner of
two British Press Awards and inductee to the Order
of the British Empire by the Qieen for services to
international joumnlism.

Recently the S {5’8 was able to sit down with Mar-
tin to discuss both
his time here on

campus and his
career of distine
gmishcd journale
ism.

388: What
have you been
doing with your
time on campus?

Martin: See-
ing some old friends because I've
been here before. And meeting, you know, new stun
dents which I haven’t seen before. One set of students
I do remember from times past. And so that's quite
nice. Grinnell students are pretty good at staying in
touch, actually, so even in Washington, D.C. I’m al
ways getting calls or e-mails from them.

SfiB: Why were you on campus in the past?

Martin: I was what is called a Woodrow Wilson
visiting fellow. That’s a program run out of Princeton,
N. I. that sends people like me who are not academ-
ics but who’ve knocked around a bit doing various
things to be sort of like an adjunct faculty member
for a week. So they give yon, well Grinnell gave me, a
particularly heavy class load. You fit in with what the
faculty wants you to do. so I participatcd in classes on
international relations, political science, some jourr
nalism.

Sts’B: What’s your favorite part of Grinnell?

“‘7“!

Martin: On this Wilson Fellows program, I went
to ten or a dozen liberal arts colleges all around Amers
ica and l was by and large quite impressed with the
education you could get in small liberal arts colleges as
opposed to megarunivcrsities. Of them, I gniess there
were two, maybe three that stood out and of them,
Grinnell stood out the most because A,I thought its
student body was really curious. It was never silent.
They always asked a lot of questions. And B, to the

extent that I could see it, I always thought the quality
ofthe classroom teaching was really high.

seas: What do you think has been your greatest
accomplishment?

Martin: Being the first Western male to dance
with a woman who is now the Empress ofjapnn. How
‘boirt that. It’s a business where you (end to enjoy it
for cnjoymcnt’s sake. I mean, it beats work. You have
a lot ofhighs. Something you get a lot ofsatisfaction
out of it. I really liked covering American presidential
campaigns and getting it right.

Another highlight was going to the Pacific Island
ofNew Caledonia going to a funeral ofthirtetn mure
dered natives, murdered by the French colonists on a
green hill in a very remote island. only three other
journalists were there because the whole island was
shut down and I managed to get there by renting a
plane. And that was extremely moving. And I always
remember that quite well. But on any given dayI have
certain highlights and then I have my lowllghts. And
that's about it.

stay: Do you have any advice for aspiring journale
ists?

Martin: I'm a writing journalist. A print journalist
and what do print journalists basically do but write?
I actually think you’re better off getting a really good
general degree than going to a journalism school.
There are three things you need: A, you need to learn
how to write, B, you need to know a bit about the
world, and C, you need to learn how to think. And
that a good general degree really helps you to do. You
got to learn how to explain yourselt. Ifyou can make
[stories] interesting people will read them. If they're
as dull as dishwater, nobody will.

The other thing I would want to say is that if you
really want to have am, you become a foreign corrc»
spondem. Just get as far away from head office as you
can get. Which is whatI spent most of my time doing.
And you might find yourselfwith a whole country to
cover and that's kind offun.

Wainright enters plea today on

all JONAS PARK AND ALISHA SAVILLE
More than one hundred students,
faculty and Grinnell residents crammed
into the Forum South Lounge on Mon-
day to hear a Nixonrera ﬁgure blast the
Bush administration. Many came back
the next day for a very modern-day
blogger’s critique of the news media.
Monday, Sept. 12 marked the be
ginning of a weeklong symposium on
US. media, government and politics,
sponsored by the muscle Rosenﬁeld
Program committee led by director
Wayne Moyer, Political science, and
assistant director Sarah Purcell, His»
rory. The opening speech, “Telling the
Truth About Viet Nam and Iraq: Mans
aging the Media During Wartime" was
delivered by Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg
is famous for his role compiling the
Pentagon Papers, a top secret study
pessimistic about the winnability of the
Vietnam War. The papers' publication
contributed to the Nixon impeaehr

ment.

Ellsberg was only one ofa series of
higheprofilc academicians and journal-
ists who visited Grinnell this week for
this 4-day annual seminar. According to
Moyer, unanswered questions of public
attitudes toward the press inspired this
year’s symposium, along with the issue
of how the media portrays and relates
to major current events.

“I think that the way media affects
policy is signiﬁcant and... scary," said
Maggie Kim '08,who attended most of
the presentations,

“There’s been a lot of public critic
cism of the press in recentyears,"Moyer
said. “To what extent is the press really
covering issues, was the press asking
enough uestions in terms of war in
Iraq [and how the media covers politie
cal campaigns and policy issues."

Susan Hildebrand ’08 enjoyed Jack
Doplett '74’s milk on Judith Miller. "I
think he did a good job of overviewe

ing a complicated issue and putting it
in context,” she said.

Obtaining a mix of competent and
diversified speakers presented a special
challenge for the committee, but luck
also played a major role. For example,
Ellsberg was already in Iovlm. Com-
ing to Grinnell for the symposium fit
perfectly in his schedule. “Ellsberg was
a target of convenience, if you would;
he was passing through How] and we
snatched him up," said Moycr.

In addition to providing commenr
tary on journalism, the committee
wanted to have diverse speakers. “[The
committee] definitely wanted a blogger,
someone with a background in politie
cal writing, and we definitely wanted a
woman journalist," said Meyer.

Duncan Black, who publishes the
popular blog Eschaton, said that he
thought the speakers at the symposium
were “interesting.”

“They've brought together people

with a variety of perspectives, both in
and out of the media," Black said.

Despite the generally high publicity
levels and the increased number of the
speakers involved, Moyer says Grinnell
did not pay substantially higher amount
of royalties to the speakers than in the
past. Few speakers were paid more than
$1,000 to come.

“Anybody with a lot of name rec-
ognition probably won't come," Moyer
said. “I don't think anybody is worth
that much money. They’re stars, that’s
what it comes down to. Sometimes you
get canned performances but you get to
see them."

The Rosenfield program is named
after Joe Roscnﬁeld’ZSwhowasaprom—
inent trustee for many years. Rosenfield
is credited for leading Grinnell towards
establishing and maintaining a s1 bilr
lion endowment that opens the door to
a wide range of resources for Grinnell
students.

Plans-related terrorism charges

BY SARAH PIERCE

Few would have predicted terror-
ism to spread to Iowa, but according
to Grinnell Police Department, it has.
Today, in a Montezuma courthouse, a
Grinnell student will submit his plea
to the charge of terrorism.

Paul VWinright ’ 07 was arrested
last spring regarding a pro—spring
break iiiternet post that Grinnell po-
lice said was threatening to their pct-
sonnel.

on March 22, the college admin
istration informed Grinnell police of
a “threatening communication" in the
form ofan online post.The post came
from Grinnell Plans, the oiiline dis—

cussion forum run by Grinnell students
and formerly hosted by the college it-
self.

Two days later, authorities arrested
Wainright at his home in Milwaukee,
Wise. After being held in his home
state, he was extradited to Iowa where
he was held in Poweshiek county facili'
ties until his case was arraigned. Even»
wally released on bail, Wainright was
allowed to return to campus, but his
case Continues.

Wainright will go today to Mont-
ezuma for what Grinnell Police Chief
jody Matherly said was “a kind of a
pretrial hearing." At the hearing Waine
right will enter a plea and a date Will be

set for sentencing.

According to Matherly, threats of
terrorism are class D felonies, so Wainc
right faces jailtime of up to 5 years or
up to 37,500 in fines.

William Francis, director of In»
formation Technology Services, and
Tom Crady, vice-piesident for student
services, said that Plans had a similar
incident two years ago.

Until july 2003, Plans was mu on
the Grinnell server. During this time
ITS received many complaints, include
ing a death threat. “The person who
was threatened met with the police to
discuss possible actions," said Criidy.
After this and several other events.

Plans was moved off of the Grinnell
server at the request of Francis. “We
would be potentially legally respone
sible," Francis said.

In Francis’ opinion Grinnell no
longer has legal responsibility for
what happens on Plans. Crady, hows
ever, maintains that if the college is
informed ofa thieat they must report
it to the police.

“We always notify people when
their life has been threatened," said
Crady. In the case of Wainright, the
lives of the police were threatened. “It
is really cut and dry."

Wainright cannot yet discuss his
case pending proceedings.

-Wainright was arrest~
ed and charged under
Iowa Code 703.A5:

“A person who threat-
ens to commit terro-
ism or threatens to
cause terrorism to be
committed and who
causes a reasonable
expectation that or
iear of the imminent
commission of such an
act of terrorism eom-
mitts a class D felony"
