The Bears

Beer is something I would guess
most Grinncllians do not think too
much aboutiif they think about it at
all. Beer seems to simply happen, like
dining hall food and ﬁnals week. But
beer is carefully brewed, and complex.
nCiaftsman beeis are drank for the one
joymellt ofthe ﬂavors," said Bill Laddish,
the owner ofCargill Malts.

Millstrcam’s Dopplcbock (available
in McNally's for around eight bucks)
was a chct,complcx. almost syrupy beer.
I drank it slow and savored the many
diﬁerent ﬂavors. In one sip I caught
something like the taste of a campﬁre,
another sip produced roﬁ‘ee. and in yet
anotherI could fool inysclfinto thinking
1 was drinking some sort or chocolaty
Guinnessl swisheol my beer around
the bottom of the glass and sniffed it
so as to get at its boiiqiict,jiist like wine
tasters tip.

Lost Duties pale ale was milnrly
complex. Pale nle is my standrby choice:
no rnarrcrwhat my mood or taste is, I’ll
always be down for a Sierra Nevada. Be—
neath the immediately iecognizable bit-
ter hoppy taste, Lost Duck’s pale ale had
hints ofherbs, even bubblegum. Vthn I
told him, the brewer, Dt.Tiniothy Bent
son, looked at me like I had had em: [00
many. He may have been right.

I wandered from stall to stall, test
ing out whatever beer caught my eye,
usually settling on a dark stout, or
someti 5 another pale ale at maybe a
hefeweisen.

As I sampled a beer from one ofthc
home-brewers associations, I knew it
was the beginning orthe entil swishecl
it around my mouth, gulped it down and
started on a second glass before chatting
With the brewer about the taste. “This

Hopi m ”151/ at /1 ﬂiwaul ing and 51/7017!ng age/ll during l/Jtﬂimmmlian eficci,

tastes distinctly bittci,"l said.

“No it doesn't. It tastes sweet," the
brewer said with marked certainty That
marked the enel of my beer criticism.

Grinnellians often speak as if the
stretch of Iowa between Des Mamas
and Iowa City were uninhabited. Maybe
some longrago explorer took the map of
Iowa and scaled out half the state with
the dire words: I”)? 12: mamtm, or better
yet, Z/Jerl'i walking iii-r, and no one yet has
had the {ice time to get out and prove this
assumption wrong.

Iowa has more interesting things get
ing on in it than a beer festival. When
I watch 6th Avenue turn to Highway 5
and allow our college to be placed in this
hilly, beautiful and strange state I feel a
teleas:.We maybe freaking out about our

EVAN PETRl I
deadlines, but a couple minutes down the
track, there's th .

on then again, we may be content
with out ted plastic cups and out kegs.

At around 5:30 p.m., rlte gourmands
at the beer festival voted on their three
favorite beers. Someone in a small forklift
took away the spent kcgs,’l'he tasting was
ofﬁcially over. Some people migrated to
the Bicrgmlzrz. where the band was still
playing, to have more Millstrearn and
chat before night came.

Some festival-goers, however, re—
mained on site, trying to ﬁnesse a couple
more drinks off the oftentimes obliging
brewers. Lost Duckbtcwing was valiant
ly still serving to the very end.“When the
party ends at two," Dr. Benson said,“the
bar doesn't close at one."
