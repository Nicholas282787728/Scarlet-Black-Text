Tradition ends in arrest, court dates

Cross Country captain’s arrest at team cocktail party may show that
the Grinnell police are cracking down on off-campus parties

BY Jose SECEBRE'SALAZAR

The women's cross country teanr
had been lit1014 High Street for over
an hour, drinking mixed drinks, telling
secrets and “doing lots of girlie rhings,"
according to house resident and team
captain Cori McKenzie '06,

The party, following the Les Duke
invitational, is a yearly tradition, as was
the men's arrivalTho men’s team ar-
rived ltt 10:00 p.ni.from the Slum,thcir
traditional off~campus residence.

About ten minutes later, the first
police officer arrived.

Within another half hour, the
Grinnell Police Department had lUT
rested McKenzie rrnder the charge of
“disorderly conduct." She was taken to
the police station, photographed, ﬁnT
gerprinted and released. She will plead

‘not guilty through her lawyer at an up-
coming court date.

According to the Grinnell Police
Department, there has been no recent
increase in arrests Detective Jeffrey
A. Hughes said the number of srrcsts
varies from week to week. “Ifyou have
a large party on High Street it is real
common,”hc said.

Shortly before 10:00 pm. a resie

a group of 12 males who were being

warning.

“I thought,‘it doesn’t seem very loud
now’," she said, “so I thought that ev-
eryone must have known that the cops
were here and had quieted down."

Half an hour later there was anoth—

The police arrived a second time.
They were unable to late' the person

McKenzie was arrested because her

Several Grinncllians have expressed
a sense of outrage at McKenzie's arrest.

Many students believe that the
Grinncll Police Department is become
ing more stringent in its interactions
ivith partying students. In the past,
thelc have been instances when houses
on High Street received three or more
warnings before a party was broken up,
Often no arrests took place.

McKenzie’s arrest followed only the
second warning for the house, and the
first for McKenzie,

When the Police Department was
confronted about the warning’s issue,
they said, “we had previous complaints
before the individual was charged."

They also said that it is their re-
sponsibility to take a stance on noise
disturbances, underage drinking and
civil misdemeanors.

this nature is a year imprisonment. But,

The SGA films committee does not meet before
the school year to train projectionists or to choose the
semester's movie schedule, which now, a month after
the start of school, has still not been released. The
projectionists’ work schedule, which is partly the re—
sponsibility of Student Affairs secretaryJodi Hansen,
is also still being finalized.

Projecting problems continue

As in previous years, projections at the Harris Center Cinema do not always go smoothly. Films
chair Chris Forster-Smith and Michael Sims offer some help, but training doesn’t seem adequate

One additional problem took place on Saturday,
September 10, for a showing OfRizz‘. No projection-
ist appeared to show the film and students waited
for half an hour before Michael Sims showed up to
play the movie. Forster—Smith said that Hansen had
forgotten to schedule a prejectionist for the slot, but
took a measure of responsibility for the mistake. “I
looked it over and didn’t catch it," he said.

Insufficient training and supervision may be a con,
tributiug factor to movie problems. Although student
projectionists are considered SGA employees and are
supervised by the Films chair, they work largely in
conjunction with Student Services
and do not arrive on campus early to
receive thorough training before the
start ofthc school year, Other than
one session that Sims held this fall
to refresh skills, most of the projecr
rionist training was done at the end
oflhe previous school year.

According to lsiseBr-own, the

training they received this year was
more than students had in past years. “When I started
last year, the films chair had ils sit in three or four
times with experienced pl'oicctionists," said I"
Brown.“We only got to see what a good show looked
like, and didn't gct to figure out how to deal with
problems."
