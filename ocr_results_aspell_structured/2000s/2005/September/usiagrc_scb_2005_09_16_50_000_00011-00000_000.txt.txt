The Grinnell womenIs volleyball
team is ﬁnally settling in to the new
season.

on Sept, o, the team defeated
Rockford College at Rockford, Ill.The
Pioneers were forced into a ﬁfth game
to decrcle the match.

“It's always hard having to play a
fifth game, but we handled it pretty
well,” said Tamrah Collins '07. “Usually
a tellm gets discouraged, but we were
strong, we fought."

The second game of the week took
place on Sept. 8, against Simpson Col»
lege, where the Pioneers were defeated
0-3.

On Sept 10, the team participated
in the Eureka Collcge tournament,
where they played teams from Alvcrno
college, Eureka college and Green
ville College.

After beating Alverno 3—0, the team
went down against Eureka and Green»
ville—losses that Emily Stewart ’08 at
tributed partially to fatigue.

“As a team, our endurance is low,”
said Stewart. “It’s the beginning of the
season, and weIre not used to playing
three backstOsback games."

Volleyball adjusting to new season

Though the ﬁrst weeks of the sea»
son have been peppered with both wins
and losses, the team is staying strong.

“We're really close as a team and as
friends,"said Collins. “That’s the most
important thing—before you can play,
you have to get along off the court."

“As a team, we're all very prepared
to play," said Stewart. “We just need to
refine that skill as a team because we‘re
not used to playing together."

The Six first years on the team this
season add valuable depth to a roster
shortened by Injury.

"The volleyball team has always
been accepting, and we all love the new
girls," said Stewart. “They've adapted
so quickly and so well. "

The first years have been adjusting
to their academic workload as well. "It's
hard managing my time," said Molly
Corrow ’09. “I have to learn how to
fit practice with homework and away
games with sleep."

The players are optimistic about
improving themselves both individu-
ally and as a team. “We tend to get
down on ourselves,”said Corrow. “The
important thing is that we keep trying,
that we don’t give up.”

them for the rest ofthe game," said Coach I-Ieatlier Benning.

The Grinncll men’s soccer team is taking care of

business and working overtime. out of the five games
that the team has played this season, four of them

have not been decided in regulation time. All three of

the Pioneers’ games last week went

they had at the beginning of the
season, wrapping up the weekend
with two ties and a win.

The men's soccer team played the Cornell Col—
lege Rams on Sept. 8 at Mount Vernon, iowa, which
resulted in a scoreless tie even after additional time
was put on the clock. Although the Pioneers and
the Rams both walked away from the game without
points on the board, the score did not reﬂect the mo-
mentum of the match.

“I thought we dominated the game,” said co-cap-

tain Kip Kelley Ioo.
Co-captain Jeff Wallace agreed, saying that they

just couldn't convert any of their scoring opportun'r

ties into goals.

The Pioneers traveled to Buena Vista College last
Saturday for the first of two games
at the Buena Vista Classic. .

The first pine at the classic
was against Martin Luther Col-

their ﬁrst ofﬁcial win of the season
against Martin Luther.

The Pioneers defeated the Knights 372 in a tough
doublevovcnimc victory.

- “It was nice to get our ﬁrst victory," said Wallace,
“especially on the road."

Although Sunday's doublerovernme game against
the Buena Vista Beavers ended in a 272 tie, the men's
soccer eta—captains still saw it as a step forward.

According to Wallace, the match against Buena

Vista was the best game of the season.

Kelley said that Buena Vista has traditionally been
a very strong team in the Iowa Conference, so the tie
is symbolic of the soccer team's strength this year.

All three of the games last week have improved
on Grinnell's initial O—Z»0 record and they have also
helped the Pioneers grow as a team.

According to the cascaptains, the team’s weaks

ball handling, but the team has put in a lot of work
over the last few days and the games last weekend
have given the team valiiihle experience The co cape

group effort this year.

When asked about the fact that four of the team’s
ﬁrst five games had gone into doiiblerovertime, the
cescaptains jokingly responded that as this was their
last year on the team, they wanted to play as much as
possible.
