As another new school year unfolds,students aren't
the only ones scurrying to readjust aftct vacation. Ever
since Bradley bateman, Economics, was appointed as
a new associate dean ofAdmissions, Grihncll College
has also been preparing for substantial organizational
changes.

The transitions began last spring, when Vice-
President of Institutional Planning and Budget
ionathan Brand and Todd Reding, vice—president to.
Alumni Relations and Development,announeed their
intentions to leave Grinnell to pursue different ca-
reers. Vice-President of Diversnry Frank Thomas also
stepped down and entered semitretirement.

The departure of the three top administrators
has forced remaining the administrators to combine
responsibilities, and reassign roles Within the a few
months.

Marci sorror, associate professor at History and
associate dean,took over Brand‘s responsibilities in the
aftermath Of the administrative changes. She is now
responsible for developing the Expanding Knowledge
Initiative, the academic thrust of the College's Strater

gie Plan, In addition sortor oversees grades, employ-
ment of the faculty and budget management, as well
as the llhiary master plan and expanding interdisci-
plinary opportunities.

She is also developing the newlyrproposed See

and Year Retreat. According to Sortor, students will
have the opportunity to “think of their goals and the
academic side oftheir college experience."

To help manage her workload, the college made a
midsiimmei ouncement that Bateman would take
over respons ties as Associate Dean at the start or
the new school year.

sortor hopes that, with Batcman’s help, the two
can continue working on the strategic Planning Ini—

. tiative and prepare for future college piojects,

Batcman has taught here {or nineteen years as a
protessor or economics. As dean, Bareman will over-
see the development of ﬁIst-ycat mtonals, academic
advising, the leading, writing, math and science labs,
independent studies and the upcoming accredidation
assessment by the North Central Association,

Britcman said all his responsibilities have kept him
“heavering away to make this year a success."

Bateman is also currently engaging Grrnnell Col-
lege in a consortium of three other colleges to focus
on essential aspects of having a liberal arts education.
Grinnell College will handle the issue of global um
derstanding.

Shortly before the end of last set
mestcr, SGA made several changes to
its bylaws, leading to new meeting or
ganizat‘ion and higher senator visibility

According to SGA president John
Bohman '05, the most important
change in meeting setup will be the
appointment of a presiding officer for
Joint Board meetings. In former years,
the president would act as a moderator
during the weekly meetings, allotting
time for people to speak and keeping
the discussions on topic. According to
Bohman, however, this often meant
that the president could not speak as

an actual officer. Instead, he or she had
to concentrate all his or her efforts on
moderating the meeting,

Bohman proposed the changes last
semester as a Joint Board senator and
presidenttelect in ordeI to eliminate
any possible bias.

“By separating the positions of pro
siding ofﬁcer and president, the preside
ing officer is guaranteed to be a more
objective observer,"he said.

Another SGA goal involves the in-
crease of student awareness of senators.
“Last year, senator visibility was a prob-
lem," said SGA vice-president Chris
Ochoa '06.“A lot of people had no idea

who their senator was."

SGA has proposed a list of new
senator duties for this year, focused on
building relationships with both the
students in their cluster and their stu-
dent staffs.

To ensure that students are aware
or changes in SGA, weekly newsletters
will be posted in bathrooms, describing

n "issue of the week" and discussing
student concerns.

Seating arrangements will also be
changed for actual Board meetings. Ac-
cording to Bohman, the cabinet used to
sit at the “top”ofthe room and address
the senators at the “bottom," creating a

hierarchy. This year, the meetings will
focus on the presiding officer and the
senators.

In the coming yeaI, Bohman and
Ochoa report that SGA will set short-
term goals for the cabinet. Thursday’s
elections were among the most com-
petitive elections in recent years. with
senator applications up 33% compared
to last year.

Because of this increase in student
interest, the ofﬁcers feel one of SGA’s
primary responsibilities is to stay ac-
countable to the studentbody. “There’s
a general sentiment of self-reﬂection
and self-Critique,"Bohman said,
