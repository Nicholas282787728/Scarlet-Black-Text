Northern State and Marjorie Fair
Saturday, 9 pm.
Harris Center Concert Hall

There are a lot of good reasons to take a respite
from 10710. Your mom might need to take you out
for a fancy dinner, or you may have a younger, cools
er sibling coming to whom you feel the pressing
need to prove your own coolness. Unfortunately,
my hepcat sisters will not be coming up to hear
Tegan and Sam and their opening bands Northern
State and Marjorie Fair, but we’d be there in two
seconds if they were here.

Northern State is intense.Their raps sound like
a cross between the Beastie Boys and Le Tigre,
with less political investment than the latter, and
less nasal jerk fact: vibes than the former. Northern
State formed in New York City, they graduated
from NYU, Oberlin and Vassar, and the intersec-
tion between literary and urban can be seen in
their names. Hesta Prynn, for instance, takes her
MC name from The Scarlet Letter. But they work
their literary and political awareness like second
nature, as they spit rhymes like “Keep choice legal,
your wardrobe regal, Chekhov Wrote the Seagull,
and snoopy is a beagle." What? That‘s right, it's
Rnpper’s Delight, Literary Studies, Sex Izmir/1e City
and Liberal Politics Lite all at once. And ifyou
can‘t pay attention to the words, it’s danceable too.

. Marjorie Fair stands out as the band with the
male line—up. They play sottspokcn-mansrouc-
rock, to put it brieﬂy. That all to say, they prob:
ably wont blow you away with innovation the way
Tegan and Sara with their killer Canadian hair
and Northern State with their ill ﬂows will. But
they may lift you up above the clouds with their
“soaring harmonies," as some reviewers have put it.
These shaggy—haired boys will likely keep things
nice and mellow.

Tegan and Sara
Saturday, after 9 pm. openers
Harris Center Concert Hall

When my friend sent me two Tegan and 5am
CDs last year,I mentally catalogued them as “folky
chick musicians," stuck them in my CD stack
next to Sarah McLachlan and Dar Williams, and
promptly forgot about them. When I pulled their
music out again, I was surprised to ﬁnd that it made
me want' to jump around, not put ﬂowers in my
h I re—eataiogued them near PJ. Harvey and Le

Tegan and Sara’s music tits any number ofhy—
phenated combinations of the words indie, punk,
pop, folk and rock. They are not afraid to be
poppy and their songs are full ofcatchy hooks and
memorable refrains, but their fun sound doesn’t di—
minish their hipster appeal.They practically deﬁne
indie cred, from their shaggy hair to Tegan’s labret
piercing. They have toured with bands all over the
musical spectrum, including Melissa Ferrick, Hot
Hot Heat, Neil Young and Rufus Wainwright.

Tegan and Sara, 25, are identical twin sisters
with petite statutes and shaggy brown hair. Their
between-song antics should be almost as entertains
ing as their music, since they are known for banter-
ing on stage and chatting up the audience.

The twins, whose concert coincides with Grin-
nell’s Coming OutWeek, are also lesbians,but don't
dare confuse them with gimmicky lesbian acts like
Tatu. T‘he mt majority of their songs discuss love
gone wrong, but each song has an unusual twist to
keep it fresh and smart, whether it's psychiatry (“I
could see you ten or twelve times a day /1 think
it's best we do it your therapist’s way”) or nicotine
(“i started smoking /Thought the signals / would
scaic your wolves away"). Their lyrics have gotten
more complex and diverse with each album, and
the songs on 2004's "So Jealous" are matuie and
introspective without sacriﬁcing fun.

Art students focus on live figures

Figure drawing ii an: gftbc more zuzexplaicdﬂzccti afar: [Inner ll!

work.

The Model

James Anderson ’06 has experience us a nude
model, working several times a week last year with . :3
an art class, and is the ﬁrst person listed in the large
three-ring binder containing 22 pages of students
who want to be ﬁgure drawing models for the art de-
partment. Anderson explained what it is like to pose
for an art class.

“Everyone on some level wants to do it. Ev-
eryone's interested and asks the same questions: ,

‘Is it awkward? What ifyou get an crection’Thc
studio is not at all a sexual environment, but in
some cases they want to think that it is.

With a new class, you can see they don’t

know what to expect. The new students look
around to see ifanyonc else thinks it's ﬁmny.
But the atmosphere kind of takes away the
intimacy from itinot to say you’re nothing
but an object there, but it’s very professional.
I think we all have a humorous understanding
of the situation.

Posing for the artists, neither side has more
power than the other; they have the obligation to
portray you. Sometimes they will show me a picture
they’ve done after they finish it and it's strange to see
how other people imagine you. They’re very interesting
to look atisometimes I’m really angular, sometimes in
really smooth and just a big contour. You end up picturing
yourselffmm an outside perspective.

Really, this job is an egoisr's paradise. You get to have
people stare at you fora long time and have people create
art about you. It’s the most [Clilxmg couple hours of
my day. It’s very zcn, staring our the window it
the water tower mid hsreniug to The Postil Sets
vicu.thn we Stal't, we do warm up gesture poses,
for 30 seconds to ll minute and 1 get to do a sort of

physical improv with my poses. Then you move onto longer poses,
which can be from about 40 minutes to three hours.

In making my poses, I choose what's comfortable and try to
imagine what is interesting for the artist, usually some twisting or
negative space is good. For along pose,you need to have the weight
supported over your hips and your spine and sit without the aid of
any ofyour appendages, though there’s never any pressure and they
let you take a break whenever you want to.

My ﬁrst time, I forgot a bathrobe. You usually get undressed in
the professors other. or something and walk into the room with a
bathrobe or rowel on because they take breaks and with something

Onithltvs kind ofthc distinction between a model and a regular

person."

The Professor

Professor Bobbie Mchbben described the relationship
between an artist and a model as a dialogue. Attempting
to draw n person requires a different kind of focus than
rendering a still life. “You're collaborating with that rcd pepper,”
Bobbie said, laughing, “but it's very onessided." A palpable “level
of caring and intensity" is immediately apparent when one enters
a ﬁgure drawing session. “Drawing another human being is such
a joyous opportunityhshe said. "1 think one can be changed by it.”
Not only an inquiry into the human experience, figure drawing
encourages students to “hone their skills." “Being 18 or an under
grad, you mightjust be trying to make the arm look right," she

said. “It is deliciously difficult and complex."
According to McKibben, modeling is often just as difficult
as drawing. “It is hard work and very difficult and the human
body is not meant to stay still," she said. “The model is so en-
gaged in trying to hold the pose and the artists are concenc
trating on getting it down. It is absolutely necessary to look
intently. How often do we get to see someone Without
their clothes on in that much light?"she jokes, question-
ing our society's reluctance to appear in the nude, “It

creates n certain vulnerability."
McKibben's earliest memory of druwmg figure
models dates buck to n Saturday morning open
session duiing her first year as i Grinncll sens
dent. “It was quite extraordinary," slit (‘1. “ I
think it is i i-eil privilege, and creates a sncrcd
trust."
