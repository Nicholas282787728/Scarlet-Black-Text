FFP, EAG come together to promote environmentalism, which includes protesting Victoria’s Secret

Charges?

Lingerie chain Victoria's
Secret has lound itself
under attack by environ—
menmlist groups. Here
are some of the accusa-
tions they have levelled
against Victoria‘s Secre:

- Almost all ofVicto-
ria‘s Secret’s 395
million catalogs per
year are printed on
virgin paper ﬁber

- Much or this paper
comes from Cana—
da’s massive Boreal
forest, home to a
number at endan-
gered species

-Victoria's Secret
catalogs also are
made from forests
in the southern
United States

' -The many indigi-
nous peoples in the
Boreal forest are
negatively atiecred
by widespread log-
ging there

major buyer of pa-
per, could encour—

“I told you that we would be exiting by the
Cheesecake Factory, orlicer," Jess Eaton ’07 calmly
told mall security as she continued to march in front
ofthc lIngctic clad prorcsicrs circling rhc outside of
the mall en mutt: to groups cars They began to chant
aDgain telling Des Moincs mallgocrs about Victoi‘ia‘s

Dirty Secret.’

“Victoria's secret, yes you could/stop using‘oldr
growth wood," they shouted,

After another four minutes of walking aiound
the exterior of the Jordan Creek Town Center mall,
nailed the cnnre way by a mall security SUV, com
plete with ﬂashing yellow lights, the protesters finally
made it back to theii cars. The mall cops radioed in
the license plates and explained the full boundary at
the 24-hour ban,\vhich included the mall, Costco, the
Best Buy complex and the hotel,

The protesters were representatives of Giinnell’s
environmentalist community and were raking part
in a national day of protest abour Victoria's secrets
use of oldrgrowth forests to make their widelyrdisr
tributed catalogs. Free the Planet (FTP), Grinnell’s
environmental group, places an emphasis on group
unity and as they were evicted from Jordan Creek, the
protesters felt good about their solidarity.

Earlier this year, that unity was by no means as-
sored. The Environmental Action Group (EAG) ivas
faced with a predicament: their membership was
dropping, either because members were graduating or
would be studying abroad in the coming semesters.
The recruitment fair wenr poorly, leaving EAG with
too few members to continue. Rather than let their
projects fail, EAG and FTP joined forces, uniting the
campus’s environmental movement into one group.

EAG's sudden drop in membership doesn’t seem
to phase FTP. “In general, there’s been a national loss
of interest in the environmental moveinent,"sa'icl for-
mer FTP leader Jon Henry '07, “I think that it's been
mirrored in the student body, not that it’s any sort of
problem.That’s just the way social currents go."

FTP co-leader Allison Amphlett ’08 said that
although FTP membership has droppcd over the
past few years, the change has not been significant.
“There’s been a shift of what people want to work on
cnwronmentally from more national issues to mart:

local and campus issues,"Amphlett said,

FTP focuses on a variety ofissucs, ranging from
the local to the national. Because the group is so large.
rhe members break down into small subgroups to keep
their actions organized and manageable. In the past,
FTP has had three major groups: Iowa Issues, For-
csts and Energy Recently the Energy subgroup was
closed due to lack ofissues. For the last few years, the
Energy subgroup had been campaigning with other
groups and students for a wind turbine on campus
The success of rhe campaign led rhc administration
to form a committee to research the effect a wind tur—
bine would have on campus energy policies. More
recently, Energy had focused on preventing drilling in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but when many
Iowa representatives were named as key votes, Iowa
Issues subsumed it. “The Energy subgroup just didn't
work out,” Henry said. The Energy subgroup was re-
placed with the absorbed EAG. Now, Forests focuses

on paper issues and lumber, Iowa Issues on wider local
environmental policy and EAG on rown and campus
environmental policies.

Despite the changes, members at FTP are op-
timistic about the future of environmentalism, The
group is hoping to promote What Henry called an
"FTP renaissance," revitalizing the environmental
movement on campus by becoming a fun and mean-
ingful activist group The group has plans ranging
from an FTP all campus party to converting dining
hall waste into biodiesel fuel for the campus lawn-
mowers. Though there may be no immediate effect,

a big success we created a big stir," she said. “We
did a good job getting out the message. We’ll have
to keep working because they're still sending outjust
as many catalogs as they were last week, bur it was a
good start,"
