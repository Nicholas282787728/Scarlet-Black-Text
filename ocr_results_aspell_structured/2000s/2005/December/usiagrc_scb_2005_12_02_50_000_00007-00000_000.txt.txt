Half-way through, reforming with results?

By TRVMORE MAGOMANA

Last year’s campaign was a battle of change ver—
sus more of the same. That description fits not only
the race for the White House, but also for the SGA
presidency.

In the race between current SGA President John
Bohman '06 and former SGA Administrative Coor-
dinator Mike Maloney’oo, the candidates appcnlcd to
students with very different strategies. With Maloncy
then a cabinet member ofSGA, it was natural for him
to promote the accomplishments of the current ad-
ministration, he said.

“I was in favor ofcontinuing the strong momenr
tum Mark [Henry'osi had created last year," he said.
“Many of the issues we worked on last year in SGA
are still active this semester ...As part of cabinet, it
was natural for me to want to see our work taken to
the next level and implemented."

. Bohman campaigned as a reformer and a change
from the status quo. He said that students wanted
more from their elected ofﬁcials. “SGA wasn’t very
visible, wasn’t communicating well, wasn’t being we
sponsive," he said.

Bohman, a twtrterm Joint Board senator, differ-
entiated between a reformer and an outsider. “I was in
the system, just not for my first two years," he said “I
wasn’t an SGA carccrist and I think that worked to
my advantage."

Maloney agreed with this assessment. He noted
that Bohman had been involved in SSA as a senate
tor but that his reformist platform resonated with the
students. “He was talking about reform and change in
SSA after a year in which was initially sluggish due
to a made over cabinet in the wake of vice president
and treasurer resignations," he said. “It takes time for
any new administration to get going and John’s was an
effective campaign because SGA did not start hitting
its stride until just around election time."

SGA Vice President/President of Academic Af-
fairs Chris Ochoa ‘06 also attributed his counterparts
victory to “John’s reform-minded attitude,” which
“made his campaign distinctive."

Since being elected, Bohman and Ochoa claim
that they have ereated a more student-friendly SGA.
“We have tried our best, looking for student input in
everything we are doing," Bohman said.

He referenced the 327question online SGA sure
vey sent out to students. "This survey gives students a
chance to critique us midway through," he said. out
of about 300 completed surveys, 54
percent of students thought SGA
was doing a good job,while 11 per

was acting. Nearly a third, 32 per-
cent orrespondents, had no oplnr
ion or were not sure.

Ochoa said they have tried
to make SGA more transparent.
Bohman recently pushed to make
public a decaderold secret SGA account that held
more than 536,000 of roll-over funds (See article
page 1).

Other changes have been less tangible, though
still important, Ochoa said. “We have tried to make
SGA more visible, taken a more proactive stance to
advertising events and soliciting student input," he
said. “John and I have also worked to disseminate
information on administrative issues, such as tuition
changes, to studentsme argued that Joint Board has

election lime.”

become more cmcienr by adding a parliamentarian
and restructuring the agenda format, which he said
has been the same throughout his time at college.

Bohman said he is pleased with what SGA has
accomplished so'i'ar. “We have made it possible for
students to come back [to the college] a day eailier,"
he said. “We are getting Grab at Go, student wages
and gender-neutral housing is looking good."

It is often harder to enact policy
changes than promote them on the
campaign trail. “I wanted to do a
lot ot’ things, like trying to increase
endowment spending," Bohman
said. "But after meeting with over
20 trustees over the summer, I reels
ized that some of my ideas were too
simplistic,"

Bohman has encountered resis-
tance elsewhere as well. He hoped
to push for onlinc prcrrcgistration after 72 percent
of students voted for it in the latest initiative, but
Bohman has faced difficulties from the Office of the
Registrar. Registrai Gerald Adams declined to come
ment on the issue.

Bohman and Ochoa said they still want to do a
lot before they graduate. “I want to restore the [Stu-
dent Educational Policy Committees] to their former
glory,"ochoa said. “SEPCs and [student Council on

Curriculum]s are at the top ofmy list next semester."

They also hope to address issues of hiculry diversir
r)’. tuition control and further SGA structural ieforms.
“The most important thing is for students to think
SGA hears them," Bohman said. “I want to restore
snidents’ faith in SGA as a system to enact change."

Administrators have been positive about Bohman’s
SGA. According to President Russell Osgood, “john
is very oiganized and he tries to pick on a few issues
and work them through." Vice President ofStudent
Services Toni Crady said SGA was “more accessible
and seem to care a lot about student input.”

Adam Khalil ’07 agreed. “The present SGA both—
ers me a lot asking for input from me," he said. “As a
result I consider it more effective and different from
the previous ones rhatl have seen in the past."

Rup Chakravorty ’07, vice president or Interna-
tional student Organization and a sch-professed ob
server ofSGA activities, said he was also impressed by
the current SGA administration. “The one thing that
I think about SGA is putting student concerns ahead
ofeverylhing," he said.

Others said not enough time has passed to cvalw
ate SGA. “It is too early to judge this administmr
tion because they have only been in office for three
months,” said jason Chen '07, who ran against Ochoa
in last year's race. "It takes time for policy changes to
take effect."
