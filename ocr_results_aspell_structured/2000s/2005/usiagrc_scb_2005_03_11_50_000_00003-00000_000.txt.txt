New SGA
Pres and VP

Elections, cant. from p. I

“Thatl chose to run with Mike did not effect
the working relationship we had established
before the election, and I don’t see it as a prob-
lem."

Ochoa reiterated the importance of more
student involvement as well. “Next year I hope
to tap into student opinion about academic is-
sues on a grcatcr scale than i have seen in rhc
past," he said, “I will work to increase student
awareness about SGA and get more students
involved in the process."

Ochoa attributed his sound victory to “the
studcnt body recogniznng] that 1 have the ex-
perience and drive to act as a means to express
student opinion."

Chen attributed his loss to his radical
agenda. “My agenda is new and less heard, un-
like the old issues that have been widely ac-
cepted as desirable," he said. “Acceptance of
new things often takes time.” He said his main
mistake was not explaining why some of his
ideas, like a new method ofcourse scheduling
and a grade review committee,were feasible.

March, meeting held against hate crimes

Swastikas, cont. from p. I
dorms, though Security has not ruled out the
possibility of an offscampus offender.

After Briscoe shared information pertains
ing to the crimes, Crady afﬁrmed the cams
pus' stance “against intolerance and hate” and
opened up the forum to student questions and
comments.

Initially, students asked questions about
safety in light of the appearance of the Nazi
insignia on campus. Briscoe responded that
me sccuriry Department will have an extra sce
curity guard on at night for the next week and
said that the college is working on installing
emergency phones.

Students also tied the appearance of swas-
tikas to ongoing problems in the Grinnell
community concerning issues of race, citing
a need for greater faculty diversity, low attens
dance at events such as last Thursday’s CBS—
sponsorcd open forum on race and unnoticed
acrs ofprcjudice on campus.

“Why do we have to wait for a crisis to
pack into a room?" said Archie Tyson ’oo. Dels
win Pinkins ’06 added we need to remember
that acts of discrimination occur frequently
both in Grinnell and around the world.

“How many people in this room have been
discriminated against when they have gone
into town?"askcd Liliana Renteria ‘06. Out of
the approximately 150 students in the room,
the vast majority of nonvwhite students raised
their hands; very few white hands were raised.

Associate Chaplain Deborah Brin spoke
ofa 1998 incident of antieScmitic and homo-
phobic graffiti onscampus, to which the com
munity responded with a 600— to 700sperson
vigil and march.

At the open forum, SGA President Mark
Henry ‘05 suggested a march through campus
and downtown to show solidarity against ins
tolerance.“Can we do a march at noon {Omar
row?” he asked. “Is that okay?"

Thc next day, about 250 people marched
through the South, East and North Campus
loggias, then walked downrown. Some ofthose
marching in front chanted,while those further
back talked with friends or wanted quietly.

In City Park in downtown Grinnell, march-
crs garnered, and Henry and orhcrs spoke of
the need to improve townsgown relations and
work on education on- and oer—campus.

Tyson suggested making the march aweek-

1y event. “Ifwe could do this every week, we’d
make a real statement," he said. “One march is
cool, but one march ain’t a struggle."

In an interview Wednesday night, Brumer
echoed the need to sustain this week’s momen»
tum. “Spring break’s coming up," he said. “It
can’t stop with spring break"

Brumer said that the students who drafted
the original email alerting the campus com-
munity of the swastikas are considering writ-
ing a constitution for a new student group that
would coordinate more cooperation between
existing student groups that address discrimi-
nationsrelated issues as well as work to address
issues raised at the forum.

In addition, SGA is starting a committee to
address these issues, as well as holding another
open torum on race and bringing a speaker on
discrimination and hate crimes to campus, said
Henry.

Others urged education and informal dis
cussion with friends and ﬂoormates as well. “If
you're not willing to participate, you‘re part of
rhc problem," said Brumcr. “Just keep talking
about it And listen."
