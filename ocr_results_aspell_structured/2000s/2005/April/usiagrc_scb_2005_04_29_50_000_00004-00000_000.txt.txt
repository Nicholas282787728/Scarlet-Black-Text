really organized tour with a bunch of
crew [we've done].

It’s been good, it’s been an experi-
ence because we’re used to small vene
“CS and Ihis is a lot orpeople and very
organi d,Wc’ve gotten good feedback
from kids. We're geared towards 13-25
year—old university kids, so this is great
because we want to do the college radio
thing

For the most part, probably 75% [of
the tour] has been college campuses,
and we’ve done other shows off the
tour, that are not sponsored by Virgin
Megatour.VVe'll end the tour in LA.

Did yum band [law a big break-

It’s been an ongoing gradual pro—
cess. It helps to get out there and be
seen on the West coast and hit major
cities, but there's a lot between New
York ltnd LA. The best part is see»
ing all the country and the Midwest is
good times.

How would yum churartzrize your

There are a lot of inﬂuences which
are hopefully present when you listen to
it, honing in on some sort ofiocky pop

songs that people can enjoy.

We hope you ran hear ties to in-
ﬂuences like the Beatles, die Rolling
Stonesﬂll the classics.

What nlalttrymir 511ml rim'grie?

We were wanting to expand, and
he ertrlly people will listen to our [mire
sicfand like it and try to listen to other
stuff too, rather than the stuff that is
being fed to people.

College kids are in the best Elmer
tion [for music], between college radio
and word of month, [they have the]
mos! music going to them.

What inr ireryoiirrmigr?

Most o the writing is done by
the lead singer Ben [Trokan], and I
think it’s just dayrtordlty situations,
[it’s] nothing really groundbreaking,
or overly meaningful, it's not dramatic
or anything. It's just about everyday
things, from wandering around the city
to riding the train.

Dvyau want this to be your mmr?
Yeah, we just want to be lazy and

rock and roll for the test of our lives.
