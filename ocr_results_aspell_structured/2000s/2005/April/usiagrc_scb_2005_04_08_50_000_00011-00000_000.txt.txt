Flight delay causes humorous freak out

As I look forward to my future outside the Grinnell
bubble, i sometimes start to feel a bit lacking in “real
world" skills. siirc,1 can write ii paper, but Wolds like
“insurance"nud “ﬁnalicc”usually make me feel vaguely
iiilllscous, And contact with non-Grmncll grclilnﬂlps
sometimes makes me feel like I belong to a difhzrcnt
specics. (th, I don't unit to talk nbout my Inc plans
But 1 null tilk about U/yrru ifyou want ") llowcvoi,

types weie ﬂipping out. “1 just end bclicvo it!"a plump

artyish min in a grey suit kept announcing. “1 don't have
time for this sort ofthing.‘ I’m supposed to he going to
Florida tomorrow."

The wellrdtcsscd woman next to me, who had alr
reudy informed me that she wis the executive editor of
n inngiuno and currently running from a spi, agreed;

“I know what you mean. And rhey still Wzlnt us to pay

for alcohol? Imagine!”

“My husband had a fir once, because the airline

would only givc him i tiny cup orCokc," chimed

in a young blondc woiunu behind me. “I mean,

you piy (oi it whole ﬂight, and they cnn'r even
give you i whole can of cit/ti?"

“Yes," declined rlic man in the grey suit,

“It's terrible. You know, I heard about this

Case once, where everyone had to sit on i

plane for an cntiie night, with no food, and

no water, and broken bathroom. And

the us. government wouldn't lei

them sue, Obviously, there is some
sort of conspiracy!”

 

 

the pilor came on over rho loud-

speaker and announced that we would be sining on the
runway until further notice, and further notice would be
at least an hour away.

I'm .i pretty weithered traveler. For mc. the end or
midrei-ms or finals week is only a prelude to the trial of
actually making it home, After three and a half years of
trips between Grinnell and New York City, t've ﬂown
through just about every airport in die American Midr
west. 1 can tell you about the mysicrious spaccrnge tunc
ncl in Detroit, the Aviation museum in Milwaukee, and
the confusing whereabouts of the Cincinnati airport
(its in Kentucky.) I've lived through countless hours or
delays ind ninlrunciious. and spent my Shiite of nights
in iirpori hotels. As I’ve said before, it this point in my
ﬂying Cluecr, the ﬂight attendant could probably remove
a small bomb from the barhruom and I wouldn't even
look up, except maybe to isk hcr irslic knows a sevcnr
letter “Dormant Peruvran volcalio"srarxiiig with ‘E'.

50 after I heard the bad news, I sank down falther
into my itty bitty seat, (at five foot three, l'ni conve-
niently sized so as not to need extra leg room) stuck my
nose into a book and thanked every deity from Zeus to
L Ron Hubbard that i wasn't the woman in the back
row with the three month old infant

Howevet, all around me, classy-looking executive

At this, thev spa woman and
the blonde woman both gasped andihly “That couldn't
happen to us, could it?" asked my neighbor in a whiSr
per. The man shrugged, shook his head ominously and
went back to his cat. spa woman gulped down vita-
min c, and a special “ﬂight vitamin" that she explained
would “boost her immune system in the in Then she
took out a Discman and something called ”Relaxation
Tnpes with Visualization Aids, " and began an unsucr
cessful attempt to calm down. Finally, she decided to
pass the time by asking me n wide variety of questions:
“Where do you go to school? Iowa? What's your major?
W hat are you reading> The Hztz/Ji/etrir Guide? 15 that for
a class?"

I suppose it’s a bit harsh of me to be critical of my
co-passcngci's. Aflet all, I was 1:55 min pleased about
the delays myself. But nrtcr all, American Airlines
can't control the weather, and I'd rather sit safely on the
ground in Chicago than land dangerously in New York.
Besides,I still maintain that untilybu’v: attempted to ﬂy
