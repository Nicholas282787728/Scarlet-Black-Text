13y noon on Wednesday, about 550 people were
standing in the line snaked through the North
Lounge and stretched outside towards ARH. Some of

Despite nervousness near the back ofthe linc, cw

“Ir was crazy for 30 minutes,
said Kasidhi, who started woik-

Gomez and Robbers on High

horh an ourdoor event and an indoor conccrr, sripularr
mg that in the case ofinclemcnr weather, the college
must make arrangements to provide indoor facilities
for the event.

“Ar the ﬁrst meeting, we were all operating under
rhc assumption that ir would be an ourdoor concert,"
said Assistant Dean and Director of Residence Life
Sheree Andrews, who signed the Contract on Malch
28,

“Based on the contract, it sounded as if [the i-
ccrr] was going ro ho put oursidc as well," said Brow
dan Baker, SGA concerts cliai “Harris was always a
disrincr possiblllry. 1 had ini lly expected rhar ir was
going ro ho outside Thar idcu carried through cahi-
ncr and orhc s People woic lightﬂllly upscr."

Unlike most events, which are
open to the public, the Cake Conn
cert is ticketed for srudcnrs only. Besides showing Pr
Cards ro pick up tickers, arrcndrcs will also have ro
show P-Cards at the door to Harris, “Srudcnrs are the
ones paying for the concert directly our of their stus
dent acrivirics fee, and for that reltson, students should
have the ﬁrst chance at seeing the show,” said Sims.

At the college’s urging, cakc's website now lists
the Grinnell concert as sold out.
