av JUSTIN WALLACE

A 1778 drubblng of conference foe
Knox propelled the Pioneers to a road
split with the Prairie ﬁre last week
end, The 6711 Pioneers are now 473
after a 2r8 Florida training trip, and
1-3 in Midwest Conference play, The
Pioneers wtll meet Knox for another
doubleheader, this
time in Grinnell
on Saturday.

The offensive
was led by out—
ﬁelder Lco Martin
‘06,whoconneetetl
for two home runs
and three RBI:
(runs batted in).
Starling pitcher
lVlnttTeeters ‘os, reigning co-Midwest
Conference Player or the Year, went
2-5 at the plate scoring four runs with
four RBIs. Reliever Bow Brannon ‘07
picked up the win pitching 4.1 innings
and allowing only a single run.The Pi-
oneer effort included 18 hits and four
home runs, while capitalizing on seven
errors by the Prairie Fire.

“We haven’t really had any horrible
outings, and [he 511((855 has been
from lap to bottom. Starter; rel/ev-
ers, everybody’s done a good/ob.”
Bow Brannon ’07

“First of all, Knox has a struggling
pitching start this year," said Brannon
when asked to explain the offensive
outbursr, “We got a couple lare hits in
the first game and carried that with us
into the second game.”

in the ﬁrst game, Knov junior right»
launder Tim Faulty held the Pioneer
bats toj t four hits
in six innings to lead
Knox to a 7-4 victory.
Designated hitter
Kevin Byrnc ‘06 led
the Pioneers, going

on the hill and went
three innings allow-
ing four earned, all in the third, on
seven Knox hitst nrsrryear Brock Mar
tinez took the loss, allowing three runs
in 2.2 innings ofrelief.

The Pioneers currently sit 1-3 in the
Midwest Conference after two losses to
perennial power Monmouth, already at
1+7 overall, in their opening double-
header. Grinnell still hopes to make a

run at the Conreienoe Tournamenr by
focusing on sweeping Homes at homc

“Our main goal is Pioneer Prlde,"
said Brannon, “which means we want
to win both games whenever a team
comes to play us at home, and split on
the road. Obviously, we didn't succeed
with Monmouth, but this weekend we
plan on sweeping both games against
Knox ”

If rhe squad is successful. it will be
as a result of a strong pitching staff.
However they will have to reallze their
potential on offense in order to make
the Conference Tournament.

“1 think everyonc would agree that
the pitching staff is really strong this
year," Brannon said. “We haven’t really
had any horrible outings, and the one
ccss has been top to bottom. Starters.
relievers, evorybody's done a good job.
We've had some big hits, we've had sev-
eral home runs but we've been strugr
gling a little with consistency, and on
defense we made too many errors in our
first few games, but we’re in good posi-
tion to make the tournament this year."
