police to do their job for them,” said
Ned Brasington ‘05, who has ties to
those arrested, “But regardless ofsecu-
riry, what 1 have been witnessing is a
genuine lack [of] a sense ofeoniinunity
at Grinnell College. What is needed is
a whole lot moie student unity. This
incident is a gross violation orthc prinr
ciples of selfrgovernance. and I think
that’s indicative of a larger trend on
campus."

Ctady disagrees that the most re-
cent arrcsts have more widcsranging
implications.

“Having been heie for 23 years, 1
can say that police involvement goes up
and down on this campus," said Crady
“It may sccni inconsistent because we
don’t go out looking for [illegal {\CX’WT
ity]. [f we walk into it, we can’t walk
away from it."

Some students counter that in 5"“,
ations- where, only a few years ago, See
curity officers might have been more
resrrained in addressing marijuana use
or other illegal acts. they now are more
inclined to forward complaints directly
to the police.

Although Crady refuted the idea
of recent changes in onrcampus law
enforcement practices, he did point to
changes about is years ago when colr
lcge had maintained a more hands-off
approach to discipline. students were
mrely, ifever, arrested for drinking, even
after Iowa‘s legal drinking age increased
to 21 in 1986, When new federal leg-

islarion came on the books, however,
administrators were forced to Clamp
down on student violations. '

Two fcdeial laws, the Clcry Act and
the Drug-Flee school and Campuses
Act, both originally passed by Congress
in 1990, require colleges to report all
crime incidents and statistics, maintain
a strict set of rules and consequences
regarding drugs and alcohol and rake
an active role in enforcing these rules.
Refusal to comply puts colleges at risk
of losing federal funding. After these
acts were passed, said Cindy, the college
could no longer afford to be lat about
drugs or alcohol and more arrests began
to occur,

“The biggest change, and in my
opinion the most disturbing, was that
it shifted the responsibility {or enforce-
tnent from police to college officials,"
said Crady.“[Forrner President George J
Diake and I wrote a letter to the Board
of Education telling them that we felt
it was inappropriate. It was a change we
were very uncomfortable with because

'we’re educators, not law enforcement

officers.” .

Some students arrested recently also
mentioned that they were uncomfortr
able with and distrustful of the security
practices and ofthe college.

“Thc College is not telling us any
thing," Cremaldi said, “and we're not
sure to what extent the college’s aut
thoritative powers will be expressed to
do what they want to do,"
