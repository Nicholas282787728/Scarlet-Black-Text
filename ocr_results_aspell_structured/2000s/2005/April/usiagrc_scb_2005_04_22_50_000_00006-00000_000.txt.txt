:ml arts school.

nance? What do you think about it?

mimble thing; I try to do thiit kind of
thing it home, get my friends to do

stance-free housing? Would you want
to live in a substance-Ree dotm?

Yes, I wouldn't mind living them 1
menu I'd check n box Snylng I‘d he will-
ing to, not thnt 1 huye to. I'd nppreeinre

Iwant to be a Minister in the United
Church of Christ, though I don't know

religious eduestlon, .\ lot of my iriends
linye n negdtlvc yiew oi religion, and 1
