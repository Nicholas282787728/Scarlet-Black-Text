School district expands ha-
rassment policy to include
one-time bullying; cameras
installed in high school

The Grinnelerewherg School District is renovating
its harassment policy. school boaid officials will also be
making changes to the physical grounds of Grinnell High
School.

The school district has had a harassment policy since
the mid~1990s, but the proposed new policy would include
the concept ofbullyiiig. According to superintendent Dave
Stoakes, bullying, unlike harassment, is defined as a one»
time incident between Students,

The new policy would also expand the definition of has
rassment to include all forms of harassment. However, he
said. “a couple of board members would like to see the term
[sexual orientation] eliminated from the policy."

To be enacted, the policy needs to pass three readings
at school board meetings. The first reading of the policy
passed at a recent school board meeting by a margin ofS-Z.
“While it's possible that that [margin] could change, my
perception is that it won't,"stoakcs said.

Meanwhile, within the past month, 17 cameras have
been installed at Grinnell High School in an effort to curb
harassment and vandalism Most of the cameras are located
inside high school buildings, but four are located outSide,
monitoring doorways aiid parking lots.

“It’s a security thing,” said Stoakes. “We’ve had a cone
siderable amount of vandalism froin time to time at the
high school. Also it's going to help with students who bully
or harass other students because the cameras are primarily
in the hallways, and that’s where we have problems with

Galaxy program assutant we netted about
83,000, and it
was a lot smalls

Naul. “This year we have about $7,000 worth ofitems."

“it's a good opportunity to get to know what's avail
able in the town," said Leslie Boyadjian ‘05, a program
ming assistant at the Galaxy. “Sometimes students are only
aware ofWalelVlart and McNally’s and the Main Squeeze.
There's a lot ofbusincsses that are going to be represented
there so it's in the spirit oftowmgown relations.”

The Galaxy has 70 items from celebrities ranging from
Avril Lavigne to the Duchess of York that will be up foi
silent auction during the night.

“Some oftlle kids talked about how we should write to
the stars, since we're the Galaxy,"MeNaul said. “We sent
out a letter asking the stars of our universe to support their
own galaxy, which is made up of the youth of our coni-

“All of this beneﬁts the Galaxy" Boyadjian said. “Our
kids are great, and wejust want to make this a place where
kids want to be."

 

 

Downtown traffic going two-way
May 1; traffic islands disappear

City management crews gave the streets of downtown Grinnell the first
part of a major faceljfr with the removal of cement traffic islands at three
intersections in late March. These trafﬁc islands enforced one-way trafﬁc,
which will also soon be a thing of the past.

According to Grinnell city manager Russ Behrens, downtown Grinnell
streets will change to two-way traffic on May 1 if the city council grants
final approval to the proposed ordinance.Though the cement trafﬁc islands
are the largest cosmetic change needed, streets and parking spaces must also
be repainted and new signs must
be installed.

“some or those things will be
done literally a few days before

proposed tramc changes are th
ing made to accommodate two
groups. The first are visitors to
Grinnell, who are often confused
by the small area ofone-way trat-
fle, “We've heard from merchants one after another that on a daily basis
there are multiple cars that go the wrong direction down these streets,"said
Behrens.

The traffic changes should also please pedestriaiis.“While we fully want
to accommodate vehicles,"Behrens said, “we also want to make sure people
have safe locations to cross the street and that vehicles don’t dominate tlic
downtown."

ican time, stiiretl many heavy emotions around the world.

In Giinnell, St.Maiy’s Catholic Church held a mass on

Despite short liollLTillit Mass was announced the
weekend before~ovcr one hundred people attended.

Following the Mass, two guest speakers tioni other

erhart, President of Grinnell Area Ministerial Association,

On campus, the Catholic Students Association held an
open forum to discuss the niatterTiiursday night,

Today, the pope's runeral service will be rebroadcast
beginning at noon in Herrick Chapel.

Among students, the pope’s death evoked a range ofrEr

spouses.

0n the one hand you feel like you're being
told actually that Catholics are devoted
to their pope, la, la, la, which isn’t true
of me. He’s old and it’s about time
’ he went yet you don’t see anyone
within those bloody cardinals—you
think Ratzinget is coming next and
you're like, "Well, uh, maybe John
Paul is better after all."
—5mita Sharma ’08

i feel it is more joyful than sad be»
cause he’s been suffen'ng rot along
time. Its a good thing for him to
rest. .

—Lui5 An'zpe '08

I really didn't mind too much that
he died and it's vehj funny that
people were so concerned about
it ’tause there are so many other
people dying in the world will
mean supposedly the guy is gonna
go to heaven and be provided for
for eternity.

——Nate Janega ’06

He was pope before I was born.
And that was along time ago.
—Juli'a Neirengarteri ’05

How many popes have there been
before him? Lots. He lived a long
and by all standards successful life.
Everybody dies; he was old and it was
his time.

‘00" Kmsi'nski ’07

[I was] saddened by his passing but

this is an opportunity to reinvigot

rate the Catholic Church. John Paul

H accomplished much during his

papacy, but a new pope can infuse .
Catholicism with a new tewor that \

can win converts.
