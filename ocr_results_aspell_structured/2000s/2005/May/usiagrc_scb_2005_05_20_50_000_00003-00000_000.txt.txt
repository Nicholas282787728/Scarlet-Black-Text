Crazy cat
adventures

Andrew Greenberg owns a cat
named Chole who has her very
own plan. He also, oddly enough,
is a founder of Campus Carnivores
and a member of Vegan Co-op

Andrew Greerrberg is probably the only selfravowcd
earnivore who has ever eooked t’ot Vegan CorOp. Greene
berg, with his former housemates from Russian House
Allison Mynsoerge ‘04 and LRTrotorri '03, was a founds
er orCampus carnivores, a group which Greenherg said
was {aimed in 2003 to answer the rimeless Grinnell
question: “How can we get school money to buy merit?”

Carnpus Ciirnivorcs sponsored events like a batheeue
to “advocate
the icspoi‘r
sihle eating of
meat” and to
“increase ap-
prccintion for
animals like
tigers and
bears." Sad-
ly, after the
graduations
of Mynsberge
rind Trotorn,
G r e c n b c rg
was the only
ticrive member
ofthe group, and campus carnivores events deelrned.

The demographics of Russian House were changing
too, and instead of sponsoring carnivorous events, the
house started to host Vegan Co-op onee a week. “Ar ﬁrst
1 ignored Vegan Coeop in my house and hid in my room
until they left," Greenbcrg said.

But after a while, he got used to the vegans, or was at
least lured by the prospeet of cooking for a large group
otpeople again, and started to cook, “I like cooking, and
after L.P. and Alison graduated, it was really hard to get
events going on my own fol Campus carnrvores," he
said. "50 [Vegan Coop] is a good excuse to cook, and
they're in my house alteady.”

Greerrberg's appreciation of earnivotes extends be-
yond his student group to a love of arguably the most
wired and active carnivore on campus: his cat Chloe
Chloe has two ermil accounts, ti Phil-i ([chlocl) and 1111
Internet photo gallery. Chloe’s various exploits are lov-
ingly recorded on her Plan—various activities include
eating a bug, eating a piece ofchicken, hunting rabbits
and sleeping

Greenberg says that Chloe, who otcoutse is neither
a student at Grinncll not a student group, needs a Plan
