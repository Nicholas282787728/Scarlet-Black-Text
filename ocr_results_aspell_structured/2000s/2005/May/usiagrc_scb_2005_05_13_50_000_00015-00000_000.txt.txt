I I see the Twins winning the Al. Central.

- The White Sox always start off hot, then
told. You can't keep pitching like they do.

- Johan Santana’s been pitching pretty well,
but I wouldn’t say he’s been the MVP.

0 Since Justin Momeau's been healthy, he’s
been hitting the cover off the ball.

. Torii Hunter’s always been the heart and
soul of the team. We've still got a pretty
young team so far.

I I think they’ve got enough bats right now.

0 Realistically, Ithink the Red Sox win the
Al East. They have a chance of winning the
World Series again.

I The Orioles arejust a fluke. Brian Rob-
erts can't continue to hit like that, and their
pitchers are gonna hit some hard months.

. I hope curt Schilling comes back and tone
tributes as much as he did at the end of last
year. He is getting old.

- The biggest surprise move by Theo Epstein
was getting Wade Miller. With David Wells

I‘d like to get another Solid starter, a lefty.

. I’ll deﬁnitely see games. I'm staying here
for the Summer, but I’ll be back a lot.

- It's WAY necessary, the Metrodorrie has to
gel People ask why the Twins don’t have bet-
ter attendance, it's because their stadium's a
shithole.

I I'd rather see an outdoor ballpark than

the Metrodorne, butI hope they can get a
retractable roof,

The Dodgers fan

' We’ll win the division, ahead of the Dia-
mondbacks.

I If Milton Bradley stays out of trouble, he'll
deﬁnitely do well. Jeff Kent, Bradley, and Ce-
sar Izturis are shoo-ins for the AllsStar game.
‘ Bradley/s hit seven home runs. Drew started
out terrible, but since then has been hitting
about AOOr All three of those guys are really
good at watching the hall and walking.

and Schilling on the DL, Miller being able to
ﬁll in is awesome. _

I The Yankees will come back Vou can't

be that bad with a $200 million payroll. I
wouldn't be surprised if they Finished second,
ahead of the Orioles.

' I’m still gonna get pissed if they don't make
the playoffs. Vou don't always expect them to
find some way to lose now. It still matters.

I I can’t wait to see some games. I have
tickets for about a games. I'm going with my
girlfn'end for her birthday

. coal ranking: playoffs, taking the season
Series with the Yankees, then beating them
in the standings.

The Cubs n

I They'll be in the playoffs. They're already
seven games back, so you’ve got to shoot for
the Wild card first But if they get there with
a few weeks left in the season, there’s no
reason they can’t take it from St. Louis.

 

0 I was really pissed about the Paul LoDuca
trade I liked LoDuca and Guillermo Motar
Jason Phillips is catching for us this year,
and he’s working out for us well,

0 Paul DePodesta needs to get Norihiro
Nakamura back into the minors. In Japan
he was an 8-tirne Alletar with a lot of Gold
Gloves, but he’s had quite a few chances and
isn’t really producing.

I I hope we beat up on the Giants the most.
I They could use another good starter. Scott
Erickson isn’t doing so wells

0 I’m surprised the Dodgers have done so
Well so far, especially at the beginning.

I I would love to beat the Yankees in the
World Series, but it doesn't look like they're
gonna be there Probably the Orioles and the
White Sox are the most likely.

- It's amusing that in Dodger Stadium, on
the scoreboard, it still says ANA instead of

Anaheim’s an hour and a half from LA.

Baseball

Pioneer baseball needed a sweep in its filial doubleheader of
the season ro have a hope ofgualrfying for rhc postseason. Una
fortunately for Grinnell, that doubleheader was at Monmouth,
and on the road. Playing the South Division leaders on their
home rurf provcd too much a challenge, as Grinnell dropped
both contests.

The Pioneers were effectively out of the running after
a one—sided 9-0 loss in the first game, but hung around and
nearly pulled an upscr in the second game before fauing in lo
innings by a 3.2 rally to the host Scots. Behind nine innings
pirchcd by Leo Marlin ‘oo, Grinnell came within a single out
ofsplirting the afternoons games before a twmout, RBI triple
by Monmouth's Srcchurncr forced the exrra inning.

“The ream played hard in borh games," said head conchTim
Hoillbnugh. “With the added pressure of playing not only the
best team in the South at their place, but to also have to beat
them twice to force a playsoffgamc against Illinois College was
a difﬁcult assignment to say the least, I was proud we were in
the playoffhunt in the end but disappornted to have the season
end for our three seniors."

The head coach acknowledged that seniors Mark Henry,
Matt Testers and Chris Villa will be difficult to replace. All
three batted over .300 this season (Villa led the team at .370),
slugged 10 homers and knocked in a combined 45 RBIsTee—
tcrs scored a team-high 31 times and Villa was Grinncll's sto-
lenebascs leader with 13. sou, Hollibaugh expressed a bright
outlook for the 2006 campaign.

“The challenge for the team next yrnr is ro believe in each
other, to work harder and play with more confidence than we
exhibited this season,"hc said. —]o: Gerri

The men's and women’s track teams will head to Mons
mouth, 11.1., which is this years site for the Midwest Conference
Championships. Both teams arc co gofrn successful trip to
Indianola, Iowa, whole the men fin thed third and the women
ﬁnished fifth at the Simpson Invitational. The main focus right
now for both roams will be preparing mentally and physicuuy
{or the most important meet ofthc ycar,

Will Frecmi ,“VVc did have an unfortunate hamstring pull
last week with Desire Takawira [‘06], our top sprinter. Other
rhan that, we look pretv

is that everyone gives
their best effort Friday
and Saturday. 1 think
we can ﬁnish in the top
three With a team ct?
forr. we actually have
peoplc who can place in virtually every event except the short
sprints. Our depth in the distance events will help make up for
any weaknesses."

Both teams will sit down during the wcck to discuss their
individual goals for the meet, but for most of the athletes, the
goal will be to put up their best numbers ofthe season.

“There are a number ofworncn competing in the outdoor

' They’re gonna have to ﬁgure out some way
to deal without Nomar Garciaparra. He can
deﬁnitely contribute down the stretch, but
they can’t count on that.

- They’re going to have to trade for a closer.
Nothing else is working.

0 Todd Hollandsworth is batting like .225 or
something, Jeremy Burnitz is doing just as
well as Sammy Sosa, though,

0 Cincinnati’s got offense, but they don’t
really have a pitching staff. Houston's the
opposite. At least they have a closers

I Joe Borowski's got a closel’s mentality, but
I don’t know if he's got the stuff. At this point,
you can plug him in and see what he's got left.
. it they make the playoffs and succeed this year,
you can’t get rid of Dusty Baker. He’s deﬁnitely a
player’s manager, but as far as the game of base-
ball goes and strategy, he’s far from the best.

I Kerry Wood’s got plenty left in the tank.
It's just a matter of him staying on the field,
and his control.

 

Men’s Golf

The Grinnell couege men's golf rcnrn rounded out their
season this past weekend at the Mrdwcsr Conference Champi-
onshrp matches, The Pioneers frnished in 6th place, and were
led by Ryan Long 07and Jack kennedy on, who posted two
day scores or 152 and 164, respectively. Afrer the first day of
conrpcririon, the team was only one stroke bchind Knoxy for
ﬁfth place, but faded slightly on day two.

”In rhe conference mcct. we were disappointed with our
pctformances,”said head coach Grchallnce.”Out players had
good game plans going into the tournament, but we were not as
sharp as we needed to be on Friday and Saturday."

Long and Kennedy were followed by Ben Johannsen ‘06,
who shot a 171,Wes Barber ‘06,who shot 3175,]ustin Wallace
‘05,ivho shot a 183, and Joe Fox ‘08,who shot a 188.

1 know most ofthe guys, myselfincluded, were hoping to
play a lirrle better than we did ar conference, said Long. “We
knew that it would take some low scores to be competitive, and
we were hoping to post more numbers m the 70s than we did.
I think all of the teams put up numbers a little higher than
expected because the golf course was playing pretty difﬁcult
this weekend."

The team will have next year to look forward to, as Greg
Wallace s very young squad will be much more experienced goe
ing into the season.

“The team is excited about next year, said Long. “We re
hoping to play some fall tournaments for a change, so that will
he a great way to focus during the off season. We are losing one
scniorJusrin Wallace, who will be missed, but to have ﬁve re-
rurning mtsity players and a number of other cornpcririvc guys
is great." 4min Byr rrr
