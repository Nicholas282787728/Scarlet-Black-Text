8 A.M. I wake up and drive my car to Firestone
Tires to get my car ﬁxed: As I walk back, a
dog begins to chase me: I narrowly escape.

9 AM. I go to breakfast at Quad. 1 am happy
because I thought it would have closed by

In what the Grinnell College
website has christened “the leg-

Noyce and two of his friends stole
a pig from a farmer, hauled it into
a shower room in Clark and butch-
ered it themselves in preparation
fora Hawaiian luau on Mac Field.

The school found out about it
that night, and, although the stu7

pay the farmer for the pig the next
day, the dean expelled all three

No one at G'rinnell
graduates with a 4.0

— verdict: false

According to Assistant Regis-
trar Stephanie Henning, gradu-
ating with a 4.0 is possible but
infrequent.

In an email to the S843, Hen-
ning said five students since the
early 19805 had graduated with
a 4.1) GPA. That averages to
only one about every five years,
making the perfect GPA a rare
occurrence.

verdict: true

by Grant Gale, Physics, who felt
Noyce showed great promise as a
physicist, Noyce's sentence was re-
duced to a semester suspension.
Although the farmer took no civil
action, such severe punishment
by the college may strike todays
Grinnellians as a bit harsh. "In
those days, the college was pretty
serious about its punishments,“
Wally Walker, professor emeritus of
Biology, recollected, “Punishment
was dealt out by the deans, not
committee.”

Playboy Magazine
once voted Grinnell
women the ugliest

— verdict: false

Playboy has no such vote,
but the College does have a
history with the publication
that is much more interesting.
On February 5, 1969 a Playboy
representative who was touring
college campuses made a stop
at Grinnell. In the midst of his
speech, eight Grinnellians dis-
robed and sang a song in peace-
ful protest Playboy’s "sensation—
alism of sex," and exploitation
of women, according to The 5&8
archives,

All of the students were later
tried for public indecency. They
were found guilty in 1971. The
case made national news, and
the protesters appeared in Time
magazine that year.
