Class invites former

neo-Nazi to campus
Students filled ARH auditorium
to hear Frank Meeink last Friday

av LOLA GARCIA

Former licorNuzi Frank Mccink dclivcrcd a talk
at Giinnell last Fiiday. The auditorium on the third
ﬂoor of ARH was full beyond capacity to heal the
former skinhead from Philadelphia discuss his past
life and curlcnt philosophy,

Mccink was the inspiration for the 1998 film
Amlrir/m Hirtm'y X starring Edward Norton. Moe
ink relayed his story of growing up in working class
Philadelphia, his rise to fame in the white suprema-
cist movement, his time in prison and his eventual
philosophical change. The former neorNaZi now has
a foundation cosponsored by rhe Philadelphia Flyers
that promotes racial tolerance through athletics.

Mceink came of age in the white supremacist
movcmcnt. By seventeen he was a fugitive from the
law and a moxrcment leader. After being released fiom
prison he returned to his skinhead brethren but after
the Oklahoma city homhing renounced his role in
the movement. Meeink now ruiis his foundation and
delivers antirhate messages at college campuses, cons
vcntions and symposia around the country and cui-
rently lives in Des Memes.

Kcsho Scott, sociology, brought Meeink as a
guest speaker for her Social Movements class though
the event was open to the entire campus. She hoped
that Meeink would be an example of “courageous
conversation." as “an cit-skinhead speaking in his own
language."

Students from Scott's class publicized the event
as part of a class project. Respective groups started
rumors, provided food and made signs to attract an
audienceThey managed to all all the chairs, most of
the aisles and the side entries ofARH 302.

“The students studied propaganda and agitation
styles and used them to fill up the room,"said Scott.

Mecink was the latest in a series ofspeakers that
Scott has brought to campus for her class this scmcsr
ter. Previous guests have included a female minister
of a multicultural church, Tony Harding and Mari7
lyn Lee from Alcoholics Anonymous, and Sharon
Marchino, a lesbian activist lawyer from Des Moines.

Both SGA Picsidcut Mark I’lﬁnly ‘05 and SGA Vice President
Rebccca Miller ‘05 think rhir despite some problems early on, they
were able ro get a lot done 1 thin this yearwenr well lleniy said.
“We got off to a slow start out all in all we ended up getting a lot
iccomplished.”

lVlrllcr agreed. “We started ottalow because ofAndy [Grimml’s
leaving." she said,“hnt eventually picked up momentum."

“We've accomplished some things and gotten the hall rolling on
othels rhat john [Boliinan ‘06] and Chris [Ochoa no] are going
co work on," Miller said orthc president— and vicerpresident elect.
“This will he one otrhe best rransirion yeais yer. we've been meet-
ing a lot with John and Chris so that they are already in the loop."

Henry echoed Miller's statements. “I think we set it up for next
year's cabinet to deal with some important issues,“ he said. “For his
stance,we made some great strides in addressing the tuition increase
issue."

Miller also hopes that the tuition incrcasc issue stays visible. “We
made some headway, but it didn’t come out as we had wanrcd,"shc
said. ”That was really disappointing. "

Henry was pleased with some otrhc changes to the Dining Plan
that will be available to students next year. “Dining Committee did
a really good job, and was able to get a lot ofwhat we asked for,"hc
saidt

Miller pointed to rho issue orhurrer days as one where SGA was
helpful in getting changes made The administration icccntly de-
cidcd to remove all Monday final exams for next year in order to give
students more timc to test and study. SGA had lobbied for the pie7
VlOuS Thursday and Friday to be counted as buffer days, but Miller
was pleased with the compromise, “I was concerned nothing was
going ro happen,” she said. “There is always the fcar that you start
working on something and never see it continue in the future."

Henry said one of his biggest disappointments was that the
smoking lounges were not determined hy the day ofRoorn Draw. “I
am 100 pctcenr confident that the smoking lounges could havc been
decided by room draw, but they weren‘t,” he said.

Both ofﬁcers advise the incoming cabinet to stay motivated and
on top of Student Affails. “My advice all along has been [to] keep
pushing for the things that you want, and the more people you have
behind you, the easier it is to be heard,” Henry said.

Miller gave similar advice and talked about bureaucratic difﬁ-
culties in making change, even at a small institution like Grinnell.
“Really stay on top ofthiiigs,” she said. She advised the incoming
ofﬁcers not to assume that things are being taken care of. “Meet

regularly with people," Miller said. “Don't be afraid to go over to
student Attairs."
