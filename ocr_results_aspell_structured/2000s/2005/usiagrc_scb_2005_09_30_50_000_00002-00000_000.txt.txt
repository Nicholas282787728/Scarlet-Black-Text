Tom Crady appeared before Joint Board and answered ques-

tions about a variety or issues, including the future of Cowles
Dining Hall spice, smoiung lounges, and genderrncutral house
ing.
Joint Board debated funding issues for community service
groups, after the Prison Writing Workshop, Alternative Happy
Hour, and Poverty Action Now groups criticized that their bad
gets had been cut. Davis Hart '06, senator from Loose, Read, and
Haines, said that the SGA Constitution prohibits SGA funding
of“any deﬁnition ofgoodwill.”

Justin Abramson, senator from Cowles, Norris, and Dibble,
sponsored an amendment to reduce the required turnout for a'
student initiative to pass from one halfto one third of the student
body. The amendment failed, over concerns that it would encourr
nge student apathy. The amendment sailed 8.3.

Responding to posters for the Cross Country team's Les
Duke invitational that used vulgar terms,Max Postman '08, senar
toi from Loose, Read, and Haines, sponsored an resolution that
Joint Board should regularly “condemn hy resolution ﬂiers which
are deemed like to be ‘intimidating, hostile, or offensive’ to a rear
sonable person within the Grinncll community."The resolution
was introduced and debated, and will be voted on next week.

Full accounts of Joint Board meetings are contained in the
weekly minutes, available today.

Osgood: Don’t panic
Tuition, cont. from p. I

provide about as percent. Iraiurnni giving does not increase, then
the additional money will Come from tuition or cutbacks.

Osgood said that higher alumni donations were very important.
“I try and make a case The alums believe in needeblind admis-
sions and small class size."

Osgood said that students should look at parallel increases in
ﬁnancial aid before panicking.

Hart hopes that students won’t have to panic. “My goal is that
you’ll have some sense orwhnt you will be paying for the next four
years," he said.

Knowledge Initiative, a plan to. improving Grinnell's
academic programming. '

SGA Presidentjohn Bohman '06 and Vice Presi-
dent Chris Ochoa ‘06 will make their report to the
hoard during an CxecutiVC session Friday morning.
Tuition will be one ofthe main topics ofdrscussion.

Because the strategic plan does not enumerate
Spectﬂc ways to achieve its goals, Bohman hopes to
come outwith a better understanding of“what are the
philosophical things we wanted to do and what are
the real world things we’re actually going to impler
ment to make those things happen."

Another topic on the agenda is gendereneutrnl
housing. “It’s one of the big things on campus that we
want to see happen," said Ochoa. Bolunan and Ochoa
will present and ofﬁcial proposal to the Trustee Com—
mittee on Student Affairs,

Bohman and Ochoa are also working with Latin
American Solidarity to convince the Board to divest
from CocaeCola, Also, while the administration ulti—
mately decides whether or not to renew Coke's con~
tract with Dining services, they feel that the trustees
should be aware that that contract will be tip for re~
ncwal in 2008.

They will also address the future otcowlcs dining
hall after the opening of the new campus center. Plans
are in the works to convert it into an apartment or
suite—style residence hall. Additionally, once the cute
rent construction projects are completed, there will be
a surplus in the Capital reserve fund, and the plans for
that money will be discussed.

This meeting of the hoard will probably be the
least contentious of the year because there are no ma-
jor issues such as construction projects or budget ape
provals on the agendaThese topics will come before
the board in their February meeting next spring.

& ASK THE PRES

What is the college's yearly operating budget? How
much of that budget comes from tuition payments? How
much do we spend per year on longer-term building
projects (like Noyce and the Campus Center)?

The college's current year (FY2006) budget can be found on
our website under the Office oflnstitutional Planning. The bud-
get answers most of your questions. It contains much of our capital
spending but no endowment ﬂows and also no individually bud»
geted construction projects. These are handled separately because
there are ditterent sources or funds (gifts, sales orsecurities, pure
chases ofsecurities, etc.) We have no single capital hudget. From
time to time (including at some point this fall) we will estimate
the cost of a project or projects that are underway.
