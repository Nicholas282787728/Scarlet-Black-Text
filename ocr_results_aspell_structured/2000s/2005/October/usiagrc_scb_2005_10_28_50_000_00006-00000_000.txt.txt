Watson fellowship nominees

Four students nominated by the college to compete for $25,000, one-year grants for independent study abroad

Molly Lewis: “Lunch Trays around the World: Food, Education, and Politics"

By SARAH MIRK

IfMolly Lewis '06 is awarded the Watson, she will
spend the next year of her life studying Muslim ricc
stalls, Indian vegetarian dishes and fresh fruit. No,
this isn’t a global tour of gourmet cuisine, it’s a sam-
pling ofwhat most American students have come to
fear for its familiaiity: lunch food.

Lewts’ iesearch will revolve around the effects of
each country’s political and socioeconomic orientar
tioiis on what, how and when snidents are fed in na-
tional, local or regional school lrrnch programs.

She plans to cook for, serve and cat with students
and teachers, prepare food and eat with local families,
and explore the supply chains for school food.

Over this past srrmmer and semester, Lewis has
worked on a MAP analyzing the school lunches of-
fered in the Grinnell-Newhurg school district. The
Watson research would take Lcwis far from the come
frelds and soybeans orowa,

Traveling to Sweden, Norway, Singapore, El sal-
vador and Ghana, her project would compare how dif-
ferent socio-economic and political situations affect
school lunch policy. Examining the two developed,

Jason Rathod: “Finding Self in the Other: Individuals in the Indian Diaspora”

BY BEN WEVL

When Jason Rathod ’06 was a child, his mom
made one meal for his parents and one for him and
his siblings. While Rathod ate pork chops for dinner,
his parents are ﬁil'yam.This is not entirely due to the
tendency of children to be picky eaters, but instead
was based on the entirely different ethnic cuisines the
two generations considered “normal."

Rathod’s parents immigrated to the United States
from India before he was born and chose to live in
central Nebraska, the region with the fewest Indians
in the country. He felt further disconnected from his
culture because of religion.

“I felt separated from my Indian heritage because
of where I’ve grown up as well as my religion as a
Christian," Rathod said. Both his father and grandfa-
ther are Methodist ministers, while most Indians are
Hindus. “So much of Indian identity in America is

Scandinavian nations wrrh greatly differing policies
regarding school lunch programs “seemed too fasci-
nating to pass up," Lewis said, noting that Sweden
instinrred a national program offtee lrrnchcs over 100
years ago while Norway is just beginning to look into
possibilities for creating a national program.

She hopes to analyze the correlatron between the
competitive, autocratic government of Singapore and
its highlyrtegulated lunch program. Finally, she hopes
to explore the situations of Ghana and El Salvador,
countries that do not currently have national school
lunch programs; Lewis hopes to investigate the Unit-
ed Nations administered and regionally run programs
that are beginning in those countries

Lewis launched her lunch investigation when she
studied abroad in London in the fall 2004 and wit-
nessed the politics associated with lunches.

“The school meal program in England was up
for debate in the run up to the May 2005 parliamer-r
tary elections," Lewis said. “This was a surprisingly
frercc debate. I couldn't imagine the Republican and
Democratic parties warring over the most appropriate
school lunch programs."

Nathan lnglis-Steinfeld: “Learning to Live after Catastrophe: Bhopal and Chernobyl"

av SARAH MIRK

“Nothing can prepare you for the
end of the world," Nathan Inglis—
Steinfeld ’06 said. On December 3,
1984 poisonous gas leaked from a store
age unit in Bhopal, Indra, immediately
killing 4,000 people. on August 25,
1986, a nuclear reactor exploded at the
Chernobyl power plant in the Ukraine,
creating radioactive fallout and devas—
tation across Europe.

Inglrerrernfeld hopes to spend the
next year traveling to these sites to anac
lyze community and personal response
to disaster. He hopes to confront these

Ifhe receives the fellowship, Rathod will travel to
Fiji, Guyana, Mauritius and Trinidad &Tobago to exr
plore the Indian identity in the diaspora and see how
Indians away from India have struggled like him to
construct their sense afself.

He plans to participate in their daily worship and
rituals, their music and cultural traditions, and their
political and social lives.

“Part ofmy project is to see how Indian culture is
inter ' ed with Hinduism in each of the countries
I’m visiting and how each has developed,"he said.

Rathod said he was drawn to this project because
it reﬂects his own background.

“I think that the close march between my per
sonal story and the narrative that I tell through my
project is signiﬁcant," he said. “The two are closely
intertwined."

that most people often try to avoid
thinking about grief.

“I will not live by the social taboo
of ignoring death and the tragedy of
our world," he said. “Success gives us
knowledge, but failures make rrs wise,
or, in other words, shit happens. Lets
look."

Although his study would take
place abroad, Inglierrernfeld said that
this work is relevant to Americans since
many major industrial and natural dis
sasters happen in the United States and
Americans need to be able to manage

“We claim this is ‘other’ countries'

at being securc and hiding,"he said.

cancer the summer before his first year
at Grinnell, He said his mother inspires
him to study griefand tragedy.

“She said. . . we are ignoring the fact
that all bins are dying. She wished the
world to pay attention, to look intensely

David Honig: “The Role of Carnivorous Plants in Wetland Conservation"

are used for conservation in other countries.

BRYAN BOYCE

BY KATIE JARES

David Honig’s *oo passion for carnivorous plants
started with a crush on Audrty II, the diabolical, vas~
cular, blood-drinking star of Little Shop of Honors.

“I've been growing carnivorous plants since I was
seven," Honig said. “It started as sort ofa Pokemon»
card relationship with them and changed to acute
ally realizing their existence and wanting to presctve
them."

As Honig, a Biology major, began researching his
passion, he learned about the role these unusual plants
play; they are often sought by collectors who illegally
harvest them.

Howcvcr, the response to this poaching has helped
nrrthcr the conservation ofwctlands, rhc planrs'pris
mary home in the United States.

“Hcre, there are ridiculously huge frrrcs to help den
ter collecting," Honig said. “sometimes. there are also
small populations within a very large protccted area."

Honig wants to learn more about how the plants

He is interested in the tropical pitcher plants of
Mt. Kinabalu Park rn Sabah, Malaysia. “They draw
more tourists than the mountain does," a source of
eco-tourism which the park trics vcry hard to utilize,
I»lonig said.

Houig's Watson fellowship experience would be
what he called a “tlirce-pronged approach." First, he
would work with conservationists in the field to see
how they characterize the plants, Next, he would
talk with biologists to investigate why the plants are
endangered in spccifrc alcas, research whether the
populations are stable and conduct ﬂoristic searches.
Finally, I'Ioiiig would like to hike the area as a tourist
and observe how the plants are presented,

After his potential Watson is completed, I'Ionig
plans to end rrp where he began: presenting at the
2006 Carnivorous Plants Vl/orld Society Conference.
He's been a member ofthe organization since seventh
grade.
