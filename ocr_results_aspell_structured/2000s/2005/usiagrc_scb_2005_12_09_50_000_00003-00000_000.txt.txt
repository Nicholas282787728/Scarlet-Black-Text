ITS to consolidate in Forum next year

Public functions like HelpDesk might occupy North Lounge or the Grill area, with offices in the
space currently used by Student Affairs and SGA. The Health Center will remain in the Forum.

By EMiLlA GARVEV

The nooks and crannies, the secret
hallways and the steep staircases of the
Forum will race changes when the Joe
Roscnftcld '25 Campus Center opens.
Alrnost every organization and office
in the building will be
moving to thejoe,but
the Forum will not
sit Cmpl'y. ITS, which
currently has ofﬁces
in six different build-
ings across campus,
will consolidate in the Forum.

SGA and Student Affairs will be
moving to the Campus Center next
year. The Grill and Express will also
be leaving the building, ad for larger
spaces. Space has also been planned in
the Campus Center for multicultural
groups like SOL and ASIA, whose or-
fices are now located in the Forum.

Not everything will be movmg.

love South ‘\

what it is,“ '~
said President
Russell Osgood.
The Health Center, which has only
been at the Forum for two years, will
remain as well.

tcr visitors will regularly encounter
ITS staff and snldclll employees at tho
HelpDesk, Osgood said that ITS'move
is justified by the need to centralize its
widespread office system. “There aren't
systems likc that on any other campus,"
he said. “It’s not
good."

Students re-
sponded positively
to the idea of the
move. “I think it’s
great," said Marci
Gomez '07. “The l-lelpDesk right now
is just too small a place. When we all
had to get anticvirus Software [at the
HelpDesk], it was just too crowded
with people coming in and out.”

The Strategic Plan discussed moi/r
ing ITS into a renovated Hurling Lin
brary. However, Burling renovation
plans were shelved, and another loca—
tion for ITS had to be found.

ITS if they

give it a central location on campus. For

indrnni Singh ’08, who said she uses
HelpDcsk four to ﬁve times every year,
that's a good thing. "HelpDesk is pretty
awesome,” she said. “But I really don’t
like the walk across to [HelpDesk’s]
Park Street [office]."

Although there are positive aspects
to this move, the logistics of the forty—
ycnr old building may cause some trou-
ble. Built on multiple levels and with
many staircases, the building is not
compliant with the American Disabili-
ties Act (ADA). “It would cost npproxic
mately 310 million to make it complic
am," said Osgood. “We are assuming
that if ITS moves in, it won‘t have to
have to comply for continued use."

There are other concerns. The
bathrooms will be located in ITS space.
When the space is locked at night, the

bathrooms would be inaccessible to
South Lounge patrons.

Uses for the large Grill and North
Lounge spaces are also being explored.
Tentatively, they are slated for public
ITS uses, like the HelpDcSk.

Potential issues caused by the large
windows in current Student Affairs
space and the ADA compliance will
be considered before the plan is ﬁnal-
izcd, but ideally. Osgood said it would
take ITS about two months to plan and
move in. “Hopefully it will be ready
to open when the Joe opens," he said.
“This is an intermediate solution. ITS
needs to be in one building, and I don’t
foresee building any new large buildings
on central campus in the near ﬁinrre."

History
of Plans

. During the later part

BY SARAH MIRK

Last weekend, administration of
Grinnell Plans was officially handed
down to Eryn O’Neil’07, Megan Go-
ering ‘08 and Sidonie StraughncMorsc
'03 in the same manner as most prec
vious Plans transfers of control. The
new reign started with a bang, with the
revealing of a new feature called "Scc
crcts," that allows Plans users to post in
an anonymous forum. In the first three
days, over 1900 secrets were posted.

The Plans administrators act as the
liaison between Plans users and Plans
“coders"ithc several alumni that actu—
allyworkonandtcwritel’lans’computer
code. several years ago when Plans was
created. O'Ncil said
“the code was just
hacked together,”
and it still is subject suth a [ll/rig,”

to bugs and quirks . .
that coders Spend Elm O'Neil

their time fixing.

Administrators
do not usually work
with the code. "We're the PR people,
if Plans has such a thing," said O'Neil.
She, Goering and Straughn-Morse
are responsible for creating Plans ac-
counts, resetting passwords and field
ing requests and complaints from users.
“Plans can be a pain sometimes," wrote
the previous administrator, Nathalie
Lauze, in an ccmail. She said that she
needed behindrthcrscenes helpers in
order to run Plans alonc. O’Neil, a close
friend of Lauzc, was supposed to bc

”We’re [he Pli people, llPlans ha:

Lauze’s sole handpicked replacement.

Too busy to run Plans by herself,
O’Neil asked StraughncMorse to help
out. Goering overheard and asked to
join, too.

" P l a n s

was writ

ten by a

woman, and

since then,

the most

prominent

adminis-

trators have all been male,"said O’Neil.
“It's cool to have it back in the hands of
three women.“

Itwas not the announcement ofad-
ministrativc change
that caught most
Plans users' attention
on Sunday Directly
beneath thc descripc
tion of the bureaur
cratic transfer was a
small notice about
the Secrets plan,
where students could post anonymous
1y. That afternoon, Plans bandwidth uSc
age doubled its normal level.

“We’ve spent all the time since
Sunday keeping up with the Secrets
drama," said StraughnrMorse. Their
main concern, besides overuse crashing
the system, is offensive or spamming
posts. “I’ve been reading every single
one,"said O'Neil,

“Well,everyone's been reading every
single one,"Straughn-Morse added.

’06, new plans
administrator

Justin Riley ’06 was one of those
people. “it's dangerous, but it's fun," he
said, comparing it to bathroom graf-
fitti.

Others,

like Sarah

Lu ’07, disc

agree. “It’s

im p o r —

tant for

t h c t c

to be a

venue to

exp-less yourself freely on campus, but

expressing yourself freely and anony-

mously are different things,” she said.

“Sometimes people do need to vent,

but doing it on Secrets isn’t a produc-
tive solution to your problem.”

The administrac
tors said they are
committed to keep
ing Secrets an open
and anonymous {0,
turn. They do not
track the origin of
posts and don't de-
letc posts except in
extreme cases. “We
don't edit," Said O'Neil. "If someone
feels something that's not PC, they
should be able to express it. It’s not our
job to moderate it. It's Ihc community’s
job to respond."

Secrets has already seen several dcr
hates about issues ianging from sexual
activity to class relations at Grinncll.

others but signed with their username.
Others have taken the idea of posting
“secrets"in a differcnt direction.

“People aren't telling about their
own secrets," Riley said. “They’re tell—
ing other people's."

For whatever reason. Secrets has
seen enormous usage. “Secrets allows
all those things you can’t say when
you‘re signing your name to it," O‘Neil
said. Already, 'users have posted per-
sonal stories of eating disorders, sexual
assault and coming out, as well as one
post that sounded like a suicide threat.
So far, O'Neil has removed threatening
posts that mentioned names and several
posts which caused technical problems.
such as the posting of the first chap
ter ofWar and Peace
several dozen times.
