Student asks: Does Coke really kill?

so Coke tastes pretty yummy. It has a delightfully hazy
texture, and is loaded with sugar and caffeine. Perfect for late
night reading. So why don’ti drink it anymore? Hint: I’m not
on a diet. I've given up healthier Minute Maid juices, Pow
cradc and Dasani water as well.

Oh i must be one of those students boycotting coca-
Cola pro ucts because it’s fashionable to comply with those
“The Grinnell Student Body Has Voted
to Boycott Coca-Cola Products" signs in
the dining hall. Don’t I know that Coke’s
contract with Grinnell doesn’t expire until
2007?

Anyway, those boycott-happy hippies are such hypocrites.
They jump from one cause to the next, and underneath their
recycled clothing, they are probably wearing underwear made
in sweatshops. on second thought, they're probably not wear
ing any underwear at all. That’s cool. so what's wrong with
me sipping a Cherry Coke at midnight while I read about
Latin American labor movements for my history class?

These arguments ran through my mind as I took my seat
at the Feb 8,2005 almost-secret meeting with CocavCola ex—
ccutives in the basement of Grinnell college’s John Chrystal
Center. The purpose ofthe meeting? For Coke executives, in-
cludingiuan Carlos Dominguez, legal director for CocatCola
FEMSA of Colombia, to refute allegations that the Coca-

VCola Corporation has been complicit in 179 human rights
violations in Colombia, including abduction, torture. and nine
murders.

Five Colt: executives came all the way to tiny Grinnell,
iowa to try to convince ii students, a professor and admin-
istratots that the Grinnell boycott was misguided, student
activists’ request that this meeting be an open forum for all
Grinnell community members was denied. Warren Buffet, a
Grinnell trustct: heavily invested in Coca-Cola,wrrs conspicu-
ously absent.

I became interested in the nature ofthe relationship bet
(ween CocarCola and human rights abuses last year, when
Luis Adolfo Cardona, a Colombian Trade Unionist at Cock
Cola, came to speak at Grinnell College. Cnrdona told an
audience of students and faculty that he was kidnapped by
Colombian paramilrtaries who planned to murder him.

In this year's meeting at Grinnell, Dominguez said that
murder was a sad daily reality of Colombia. He claimed that
the murders of unionists did not involve the CocasCola COP
porar‘ron but stemmed solely from paramilitary perception of
unionists as leftist sympatliizcrs, This claim by the legal direc-

tor for COCHTCOI‘J FEMSA is contradicted by the testimony
ofotl‘ier parties whose credibility is not marred by responsibilt
ity for the legal protection ofthe Coca—Cola Corporation.

Wollrdocumomcd evidence points to Coke‘s complicity in
antrunion violence. The NHL: yin/t City [curtain/ing Dt/t'gm
Iran 177! ComeCo/a in Colanlbin traveled to Colombia in January
2004 to collect data and assess labor unronists‘clarms of but
man rights abuses by the Coca-Cola coipo-
rationThcy noted a suspicious concurrence
between labor negotiations and heightened
:xtrulcgill violence against workers.

Transcripts of interviews with victims
and family members indicate that paramilitaries told victims
that they would continue abuse them unless they stopped int
rerfering with the interests of Coca-Cola.

Union workers shared eyewitness ac-
counts of plant managers and directors
talking to and drinking with paramilitaries.
The delegation heard multiple testimonies
oflocal coke managers paying paramilitar-
ies.
Additional eyewitness accounts demt
onstrate that paramilitaries had unrestrictt
ed access to Cocn‘Cola plants. In fact, in
1996 union leader Isidro Gil was murdered
inside the CocatCola bottling plant, shot seven times. only
two drrys after this murder, pararnrlrtaries came back to the
plant with letters ofreslgnation printed on Coca-Cola’s coin—
purers. Union leaders were forced to resign union member-
ship under threat ofdeath.

During the meeting at Grinnell, Dominguez admitted to
the existence ofsomc problems in Colombian bottling plants.
He said that he personally visited ouch facility involved in
complaints and interviewed each worker involved in allegae
trons against coke. Domingucz's failure to uncover the true
problems with CocaeCola using these tactics is unremark-
able.

In fact, a student union organizer attending the meeting
countered that such tactics as personal meetings with com
pany representatives were often used to intimidate unionists.
In light ofcontrnual intimidation and terrorism ofCoca»Cola
workcis in Colombia, Dominguez should not be surprised
that hc, pcrlmps inadvertently, may have intimidated uniorr
ists to the point that they view media as a more effective way
to voice concerns,

Thoughts on Coke’s exec
meeting at Grinnell

csr might hinder a personal investigation. Perhaps the reason
that legal director for CocatCola FEMSA did not obtain the
same interview results as the New York City Delegation has
to do with Coke’s pattern of suing activists and unionists for
speaking out against the company

Coke executives at the Grinnell meeting were unconvinv
ing. It is alarming that CocasCola still refuses to cooperate
with independent fact-finding coniinitteeswisliing to conduct
investigations in Colombia. CocasCola must take responsibil-
ity for the safety ofits workers in Colombia. it is the rtsporisie
bility of mullrtnatronal corporations not to condone violence
for economic benefit.

Similarly, informed consumers all over the world have the
power to pressure corporations to respect human rights. Even

informed consumers in tiny Grinnell, Iowa,
at tiny Grinnell College with an exclusive
beverage contract that does not expire until
2007.

Boycotts are controversial methods of
resistance and Dominguez argued they can
end up hurting workers more than corpo—
rate human rights violators. But in the case
of CocasCola, it is the Colombian workers
themselves who are calling for an internat
tional boycott. Until Coke starts providing
the rights and security workers demand, unless Colombian
labor unions call off this boycott,I refuse to drink Coke while
reading history or otherwise.

The political significance ofmy underwear remains a myse
tery to the world. But hopefully the solidarity of students in
the United States with Colombian labor unionists will serve
as a warning to all multinational corporations.

The less Coca-Cola we drink, the less Grinnell College
buys from CocatColrr until the contract expires. And the
more leverage we, a student body that voted overwhelmingly
to boycott Coke, have to veto CocasCola when the contract
comes up for renewal Maybe we can do what Carleton Colt
legc, Lake Forest College, and Bard college have already
done: kick Coke off campus.

students attend parties, drink more than their share
or beer, and probably paid nothing. Party throwers
usually spend a lot of their own money on the party
