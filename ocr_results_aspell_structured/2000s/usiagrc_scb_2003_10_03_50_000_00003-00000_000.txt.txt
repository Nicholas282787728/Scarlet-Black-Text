‘Cold Water’

Part | of a series devoted to aspects of Grinnell 3 international community

by Trevor Harran & Aly Beery

international student Orientation is about "preparing

'inrcrnatiolml students for what's In com: ar Grinnell: cold

water culture shock," said Alok Shah ‘04, once assistant
to the omce oflnternarional student Services. Shah, who
helped run this years international student Orientation
added that the week helps with acc limarirarion and home»
sicloiess.

Orientation week, which takes pl ace week before New
student orientation, aims to reach new international stu.
dents itvhat to eirpcct from crinnell, what to do, what not
to do," according to Shah.

During International student orientation, studeno are
welcomed to campus by a variety of speakers, including
rcprcscnrarives from the financial aid and admissions of.
fices. Throughout the weck the students focus on immi-
gration status and student and Exchange Visitors Infor—
mation system (SEVIS) laws, as well
as Grinnell amdemiccxpccladons and
social issues such as during and drinle
rng.

International students are prepared
for “what they can estpecr in classes,
what the professors will expect of
them," said inner Alexander, director
ofintcrnarional student services. ”We
talk a little about writing and how
writing is dihereiit iii dinerenr perspeo
lives. Cultural issues such as commu-
nication issues, living in the residence
halls and what they can expect that ex.
patience to he like [T]lic focus is
on how the culture is clifrercnt train
the culture they come from."

International students can elect to have a peer mentor,
a multicultural strident assigned to them to help guide die-m
through any pi-oblcms they might be having during their
stay at Grinncll.

students also meet their host families ifthcy have char
sen to have one prior to arrivin 'n Grinnell. They can
choose to siuywith their host families during International
Student orientation or they can opt to stay in the dorms.

“When I got to my hosr patents there was a sign on
the door tliatsaid, welcome, Mini' and asign on my room
door thntsaid ‘Mi s room,'" said Mrialini warsa ‘06. “And
they had the most amazing do in too that settled cv-
cryrhing heroine I could nnivin , play with dog they
were great.

Even though AnantaTiwari toe and sanchit chokhani
‘05 claim that orientation had “too many iccbrcakers," they
felt that the week was enroyable and necessary

“lorieiitationl was a good thing for us to get arch.
matcd to the U.S.," said Chokhani, “but when you al.
ready know each other you have a hard time meeting other
people once the American students come I've heard
some American students talk about how it is hard to get to
know international students for the same reason."

indeed, a common criticism are separate orientation
week for international students is that it prevents the group
from intermingling with thcArnciican students.

“We keep telling them to make ﬁlcnds with Amen»
runs but a cerrain element lofscpaintioiil will still remain.”

——
"Everyone assumes that
the international stu-
dents can relate [to
each other] just be»
cause we're from out-
side America, but that
is not true. "
~Mr7'nall'ni Watsa ’06

said Shah. The orientation committee and those working
in the office of international student services tries to ad.
dress problems that intcrnarional students sometimes have
because ofthcir diverse baclgrounds, such as interacting
with their roommates and integrating into Grinncll oub
sidc ofthe international community. “For example," said
Shah, "We insist that when [the students] ﬁrst arrive the
internationals not unpack before their roommatels) get
there."

Because diKcrenoes arise in language even among stu—
dents from the same country. orientation wcek helps stu—
dents feel out what level ofconimunication they are come
fortable with, as well as where they need to improve,

Chokhani and Tiwari are both from Kzrhmandu,
Nepal, “W: didn't have much experience speaking proper
English,“ said Tiwari. “Both ofus went to a Jesuit school
in Nepal."

Chokhani agreed. “I'd never had
to talk in English for extended perie
ods of time before," he said. “with
respect to verbal English, tutorial. and
my tutorial professor, taught me to he
more selective about the words 1 use
to docribc something in a proper con.
vcrxarlon."

When Chokhani and Tiivuri are
together they usually speak Ncpali.
unless they are around their Hindle
speaking friends.

“I speak a lor more l—lindi here
than I ever did in Nepal,” said riivnri.
“It's gotien so much better since I’ve
been here."

because English was watsa's first language, the prob.
lem ofcornmunicarrng within the us. did not proscin a
problem forhei in thesarnc way it did for diosewho learned
English as a second or third language. Being fluent in Enr
glish, however, was not a cum—all.

“I find language a problem here," :alszIsar “it's uni»
versally accepted that Hindi is what you speak in lndi ..
burl didn‘tspcnk it . .. sometimes other liidianswlll switch
to Hindi and I am lust not appreciative either." She ad.
mits that while its familiar to hear other languages being
spoken to and around her, she “wonders how Americans
real" who can’t understand wholc cornersations going on
around them. “It can’t be pleasant,“ she said.

litter-national Student Orientation week hopes to allc.
viate, or at least identify, issues such as language barriers
before the pressure ofclasses starts. watsa felt that the wcck
helped put her experience at crinnell in perspective and
was a great way to develop close ties. she tries to bc vigi—
laiit, however, about the criticisms oforicntation as pro-
moting cliques.

“The amount that you b:cochmcncnn [is judged]
said worse. “some people say, ‘Oli, she's so welladrustcd'
becauscl have American friends and some would say, ‘Olr.
you’re a wiuma-bc.’ The best way to get around it is to have
a good mist offrienrh."

Services

Jet leg from a 36-hour journey, time differences that
skew circadian rhythm and the challenge of carrying on a
conversation in a rather unfamiliar language are just a
few hurdles that international students race when they
move to the us. for college.

"Our ofﬁce tries to help students maintain status and
make [this] process as painless as possible," said Janet
Alexander, director of international student services. Part
of Alexanders job is to plan the International Student
Orientation week (ISO) that takes place the week prior to
New Student Orienmtiorl. "I do a selection process every
year or four orientation assistants," said Alexander. "rhey
meet with me in the spring and we do most of the
planning in the spring time.”

Grinnell's multicultural and international orientation
weeks seek to help students adjust to their new
environment while bridging cultural gaps among students
from abroad as well as in the us. raced by incoming
students from abroad and those coming horn here in
America. “The two orientations have different goals,” said
Alexander. who doesn't believe that either orientation
segregates people or creates cliques. ”People associate
themselves with groups that they feel comrortable with.”
orientation week is a necessary part in both her job and
the experiences international students have at Grinnell.

After being at Grinrlell for five years Alexander has
seen a rise in the number of students studying abroad.
She also predicts that eventually the more concise and
easier application processes for studying abroad in the UK
and Australia will decrease the number of students
coming to the us. even though the total number of
students around the globe who study abroad will continue
to grow. This is showcased by the fact that Grinnell hasn’t
had a non-American student from either country in five
years.

New American security measures in the wake of Sept.
11 have inﬂuenced this decline. ”Some of the students
have a great deal or dirficulty with the admission process
and it has changed a lot since 9/11," said Alexander,
whose own workload has doubled due to the paperwork
necessary in maintaining these students' statusr She still
find: time to get acquainted with each international
student and hollow his or her progression through college.-
Her relationship with the international students begins
when she first welcomes them arter their acceptance to
the college and ends once they are done with their
education at Grinnell.

”1 love my job." said Alexander.
