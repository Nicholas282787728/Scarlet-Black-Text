Tobacco and Education.

The December number of 410th
mi Mm’rn‘rtn has an interesting ed-
itorial on the inﬂuence of the use
of tohaccotespccting physical and
intellectual development. It
calls attention to some tests made
by the authorities of Yale and Arn-
herst Colleges, respectively, which
call for serious consideration. It
was found in a class of 147 stu-
dents in Yale College that In four
years 77 who did not use tobacco
surpassed the 70 who did use it to
the extent of lo.4 per cent.
crease of weight, 24 per cent. in-
crease of height, 25.7 percent. in-
crease of chest girth, and 75,5 gain
in lung capacity.

In Amherst College the gain in
favor of the abstainers from to-
bacco in ion.- years was, weight, 24
per cent.; height. 37 per cent;
chest girth. 42 per cent; and lung
capacity, 75 pcr cent.

The above tests were made by
competent physicians with careful
measurements, and are of the ut»
most signiﬁcance

In consequence of these ICSLIll5.
and as a result of extended and
impartial observation by promi»
ncnt educators as to the effects of
tobacco upon the minds of stu-
dents, the Boston University has
formally declared that all its sttir
dents who are unwilling to forego
the use of tobacco while connect-
ed with the university will have
their fees refunded and their eu-
rollment canceled.

The Ohio Wesleyan University
also forbids the use of tobacco in
any form by its matriculates, and

Records ofAthletes.
It has been the custom for the
past four years, forthc track team

candidates to undergo a physical‘

examination belme the active
work on the track begins.

The work has been. so far, of
much interest and nota little
value, but it has been difﬁcult to
makethe boys realize its import-
ance. It is the plan of the Direc-
tor to keep the records of each
individual case and tie-examine
each case every spring as long as
college. Thcsc
records will be bound and pre-
served in the college liblal‘y
They will thus furnish data which
will be ofgreatvalue in showing
whether athletics do or do not
develop a man healthfully and
syrnmcti-ically. They will also
show what relation athletics and
scholarship bear to each other, as
the average yearly scholarship is
noted on each record.

The examinations are ofper-
sonal vahretccaclrman,in that
he has an opportunity to ascet-
tain the kinds of exercise he
should avoid as well as the vari-
ety best suited to his condition.
It also shows up any {laws which

might be made worse by certain
exercises or cured by

This year Captain Rush will

schedule the dates and hours for‘

each man and it is to be hoped
that this examination will be at
tended as faithfully as one in Bis
ology or Greek.
