Community Action: A Goal

One of the S & 13 staff members had occasion the other
day to talk to Mr. Mr F, Zimmerman, newly-elected mayor
or Grinnell. Mix Zimmerman mentioned that he was eager,
to work toii'ard lowering Grinnell’s appallingly high juve-
nile delinquency rate, and toward bettering law enforcement
in general, ,

Later the same day the staffer went to Mrl John Burma
of the sociology department, told him of Mr. Zimmerman’s
ideas, and added that the mayor had reacted favorably to
a suggestion that he work with the college on these pl’Ol}
lems. Mr. Burma said that he would be pleased to cooperate‘
with Mr. Zimmerman on any plans he might have.

With nothing more than these incidental bits of conver»

 

sation in hand, we wish to propose II project in which the
town and gown would work hand in hand toward the mutual

benefit of each.
We suggest that our

merits, in full cooperation with _ .
lay out a plan for ridding Grinnell, as much as IS feasible, of
juvenile delinquency and law enforcement problems.
these departments have the knowl-

gentlemen who compose

edge necessary to make out such a plan _
and his fellow workers have the intelligence to recognize

the value of such aid.

With the cooperation of townspeople and students, who
compose a tremendous reservoir of talented energy, there
is no reason why we cannot make a model town of G'l‘lnr
nellia town in which we can be proud to work and play

and study.

Dear Sir:

This letter is an explanation
of 'the appointment of Jame
Slichter to the League Board to
replace Kathryn Cosandey, who
will not be here next year.

The constitution of the W0-
men's Self—Governing Associa—
tion had this to say: “In case of
withdrawal from College or for-
mal resignation from the Board,
after election! the vacancy shall
be filled by appointment from
the list of eligible incoming sen-
iors, preference being given to
the four nominees not elected to
the Board in the spring election.
The appointment shall be made
by a two-thirds majority vote
of the Executive Board."

Constitutionally, the League
Board is not bound at all in its
appointmentsbut, actually, each
of us on the Board did feel
bound to follow the Wishes of
all the girls who had voted in
the last election. Janie was very
much their choice, and, there
fore, ouIsl

Dear Sir:

In last week‘s ssce there ap-
peered a letter concerning the
League Board and its disciplin-
ary duties.

As this was an anonymous
letter, it is either a reflection
of the editorial policy of the
paper (which I have reason to
doubt) or the scurrilous pros
.duct of a crank with a dislon

sated sense of humor who has
neither the courtesy not the
courage to make himself known
to those he attacks.

Though it is not the intention
of this letter to take issue with
“Vitehitivitch” concerning the
actions of the League Board
members, I would like to say
that these girls have conducted
themselves wisely in positions
which demand the utmost in
judgement and tact; and they
certainly deserve better than to
have their characters smeared
in public print by an irrespon-
sible poison—pen.

1 think it only fair to the
League Board, and to the stu-
dent body as a whole, that the
writer of that letter make hims
self known and, if he wishes,
make whatever explanations he
thinks necessary.

Dear Sir:

I have just read Dave Jelin-
ek’s letter to you. and it upset
me. Last week, coward and dis-
courteous wretch that I am, I
wrote you a letter under a fic-
titious name. In that letter I
said, generally speaking, that
as long as the women’s drink»
ing rules are as they are, and
are to be enforced as they are,
that women who are willing to
spy on their comrades for what-
ever satisfaction it may give
them should be trained to do'
the job right.

Naturally Such training would
include long hours of window
peeking, and a stiff course in
keyhole technique. .

In my letter I wrote (partia
quotation), “If it is necessary
to crawl through sewer pipes,
there are girls in this school
Who have the character to do
it." Now Jelinek says that lets
ter, and consequently the de-
scriptive material in it (see last
Week’s 5&3). applies directly to
League Board, If that isn’t in-
sulting, I don't know what is.
