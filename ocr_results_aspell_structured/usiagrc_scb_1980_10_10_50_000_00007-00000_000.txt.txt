This weekend the Ullicc oi Admisc
sions and the Concerned Black Students
organization (CBS) is sponsoring the
1930 Black Prospectivcs' Weekend, The
purpose oi the weekend is to oii black
students a chance to Visil the Grinnell
campus and gel a tee] 0t what it Is like
to be a black at Grinnell.

Murray G. Jolivelte, coordinator lor
minority recruitment, projected that
perhaps 13 to 17 students and one
counselor would lie arriving for the
weekend. Last year less than in
students participated in the weekend,

Jolivetie was pleased to announced
that the black prospectives would be
coming irom a diversity of places such
as Maryland. St Louis, lowa City,
Chicago, and Lincoln. Neb

Black Prospectives' Weekend was
developed over 10 years ago to aid
visting prospectives and offer them a
chance to see Grinnell in its normal set
ting Joltvette explained that the col
lege does not create an artiiical en
vironment tor the prospectives, but me
stead provides these students a chance
to meet the iaculty and administration,
as well as other black students,

in the past, Black Frospectives‘
Weekend was held in the spring, but
this year the Administration, Admisr
stons, and the CBS decided to move the
weekend to the tall schedule. They hope
this action will introduce inquiring
students to Grinnell at an earlier point
in their college decision~makmg pro-
cess.

by Barb Ritier

At last Wednesday‘s lengthy Joint
Board meeting the possibility oi getting
Jimmy Clifl and the Third World, two
reggae groups, to do a concert here at
Grinnell went under some heavy
criticism The cost of the venture would
be $10,500, and ii the allocation ls ever
approved, would cut next semester's
major concerts budget iii halt.

In addition to this proposition there
was some discussion oi the practicality
oi combining this concert with the
James Gang Bang. If they were car
sponsoring the event, it would be
scheduled the weekend before semester
iinals, causing some problems to the
students of James Hall, Due to inl'laa

jor Concerts, suggested that this would
be "our last chance to do something
really memorable," and called for an
"end ttol mediocrity. let‘s go with this

all the way "

Joint Board lJBl dissolved into Com-
mittee of the Whole to discuss whether
or not it was in the JB'S best interest to
pass judgment on resolutions brought
up that were political or issue oriented.
Two contlicttng vtews were immediate-
ly exposed as to the role olSGA on cam-
pus.

Bill Stowe warned of possible
ramtiications ii JB were to take up this
role, leaving the door wide open ior the
student government to turn into an open
iorum tor political issues not directly
related to students or the campus.

Paul Volker and John Conyers quick
ly moved to say it could be a positive
thing [or SGA to serve as an open forum
for political or other ideas, and would
not necessarily become the main lunc-
