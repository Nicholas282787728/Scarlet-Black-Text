THE BRYAN LECTURE.

The Boy crater oi the Plane Appears
or his Eesr and Delivers a Bril-
liant Lecture.

Only a fairsized crowd gathered at
tiie church Monday evening to hear
the lecture by W. J. Bryan, but the
applause that greeted him when he
came out to be introduced leit no
doubt as to the enthusiasm which was
awaiting him, Probably no person
there feltthathe did not know Mr.
Bryan pretty well and those who had
heard him beiore counted him as al-
mosta personal friend, and as such
accorded him strict attention through-
out. .

To some the speech was ilisappointr
ing, in a way, ior iiir. Bryan is noted
as an orator, which reputation often
leads people to expect high ﬂown
bursts oi eloquence, irantic arm»wav~
iug and the like, but this man taught
a new lesson in eloquence and proved
that to be an orator does not necesslr

tat_e beiugairianiac. In a quiet un-
assuming way he said what he had to

say and what he thought and believed
and when he had ﬁnished everyone
felt that the man before them had
“delivered the goods.”
Hissubjectwas ”The Value of an

Ideal." The most dissatisrying thing
in the whole speech was the speakers
inability to keep away from his poli-
tics and in one or two places he car-
ried them it little further than was
necessary to a direct bearing upon the
Subject.

To Mr. Bryan’s mind the ideal (IE-
[ermines what the man is to be. He
must have it in some form or other or
failure is the sure result. His ideal
must. be highinot so higii that we
loose sight of it at times, yet far
enough beyond us that it can never
quite be reached, ior when a person
reaches his ideal. progress immediate-
ly stops and there is little gained. An
ideal is necessary to [he indiiidunl
for it determines character, but for
ultimate suc 55 it is required that
social groups have ideals. The cheat
and [he liar will Win for it time and
apparently succeed, but in any walk
of life discovery must come and Izulilre
rollow. just becausea high ideal, one
of honesty and virtue, was lacking.

Political parties must have their
idealsand they can have them only
when the men who compose and lead
them have set for themselves a, high
mark of honest ambition. Time was
when young men were advised to keep
outoi K‘dirty politics” for ieai‘ 01 con-
tamination, but there is always op»
portunity, and always need ror men oi
high ideals to go into politicsond pur-
iiy them. Mere party issues does not
always determine which side shall be
in powe t is the Side which Wins.
In fact, on questions oi moral and so-

cial right the high minded leaders oi

THE BENNETT SCHOLARSHIP,

' ,iiryari so ravnrably that herore
leaving town he left with President
ni-adlcytlie suin oi $500. the interest
of which is to be given to some W0i>
thy student. This sum is a. portion
or the $10,000 which the late l’hiio
Sherman Bennett, of UDnliecticut,left
to Mr, Bryan astrustee, to be distrib~
uted among twelitysﬁve or the small
colleges of the west. Grinnell is to be
congratulated on being numbered
among the iortuuote ones. It was re-
poited that Ames had also received
asohoiarship but the morning papers
deny the report.

TRIANGULAR DEBATING LEAGUE.

A Forensic Organizarinn has been
Formed by Arnes, Drake and
GrinnelliA New Venture,

The past week has broiightrorth the
development or an organization which
promises to revolutionize debating in
the three institutions concerned. The
Iowa Triangular Debating League
has been formally launched and Will he-
come a permanent ﬁxture as soon as
the compact is adopted by Drake and
limes, The compacthas been adopt-
ed by the Debating Union of Iowa
College and similar action Will un-
doubtedly be taken by the two other
schools in a short time.

The compact in brief provides for
three debates; allof which are to be
held on the same date but with a de-
bate in each school. This is possible
by the iact that each school is repre-
sented by two teams. One team tie»
hates (Lt home on the afﬁrmative With
one of the other schools, While the
other team debates on the negative at
the other school. The schedule'roi-
1905-06 will be:—

Grinnell at times

urake nUGiinueil

Ames at Drake

Each team pays their own expenses
while the local organization pays all
the other expenses. It is thought
that this method will not only prove a
ﬁnancial success but will arouse great-
er enthusiasm in all of the schools.

The executive power of the League
is vested in a board of three members,
who have complete charge orall ariairs
but who receive instructions from
their local organization. A plan sim-
ililr to this has been in force for sever-
al years at Columbia, Cornell and
Pennsylvania and has proven very
successful.

Cowper and . Herbert Miller. A
iew or Mr iller's press notices are
here given

"Mr. Miller's appearance on this oc-
casion, was a most ﬂattering one,
His splendid baritone was eirective in
the diiiicult Von Fieiitz and Schumann
songs, the singing of which caused
more than ordinary enthusiasm on the
part or the audience‘and earned roi-
him many recalls. Mr. Miller’s ﬁne
baritone rang out with the authority

of an artistiMusical Courier, New
York.

The vocalist of the evening was
Herbert Miller, a singer Dot’ beiore
heard here in Public, Mr. Miller is a
baritone who hails, itisjbeiieved, from
New York, but who has ;rcceiitly he»
come a Chicagoan. His voice is a
more than usually agreeablczone, iree,
clear, and resonant, well produced and
comiiienriably used. He singsirankiy
and honestly, and in this day of shut
up, artiﬁcial, “pretty” tonal work,
such singing is‘zt pleasure and a relief.
He gave songs in English, German,
and French, and while hisoerman has
an occasional slight trace oitiic Amer-
ican accent. his pronunciation and
enunciutiou were. us a rule, exact and
delightinlly cleai. He is an addition
to the rillllls oigoari singers in Chicago.
and his iiiture nppcarances will be
anticipated with pleasure-w, L,

divergent lyric, dramatic and oratorlo
roles with iacility and mastery.
