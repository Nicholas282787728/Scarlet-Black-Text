Students say
evaluations were

useful but ignored

By Flora Minitz

The proiessor evaluation lorms
that were once mandatory. will no
longer be handed out and as the
semester nears its end. the usual
time for this evaluation, the deci-
sion not to distribute the terms
has drawn a mixed response lrom
students. Most Of the students aSk'
ed felt that the evaluations werea
worthwhile idea but were disapr
pointed in that they leit proiessors
paid little attention to them.

“They were, a good idea but
iaculty never responded or paid
attention to them,” Rebecca
Rhodes said.

Diane Uelkln agreed. "They
tevaluationst could have been
very helpiui to iaculty.
though i don't know much atten-
tion professors paid to them."

“It’s not 'worth the time or
money. but the concept is good
It’s Just too bad that, most
teachers don't pay any attention
the evaluations." Jim Niemeyer
Commented.

Ben Johnston agreed that they
may have been ineiiective --i

think they should be brought
back.” he Said. "They werea good
idea but teachers didn't pay atten-
tion to them. People have been
asking tor a dillerent chemistry
hook [or years out every year the
same book is ordered." Johnston
said.

other students cite the ad

"The proiessors paid attention
to the evaluations but the ads

stated.

"The administration didn‘t pay
attention to them. Protussor l’lpal
