We are requested to primi the [ol-
lowing communication on a subject
just now engrossing llhe minds of the
student body. A View on the other
side of the question, received later
ihzn Lhis, is crowded out this issue
but will be published Saturday.

ED. SCARLET AND BLACK 7

Inasmuch as in the hallctiug for
SenioriAlumni pins sereral new de-
signs have been submitted to the
student body for consideration, we de-
sire to express our views in regard to
thismnuel‘ through the columns of
your paper.

1n the present situation three facts
are obvious: First, the senior class
must have n pin or some sort at once,
whether or non an agreement? is reach-
ed on the proper design for a senior-
alumni pin. Second. a Senior-Alumni
pin must be oi a simple design re-
presenting the college, preferably in
the college colors. Third, on account
DI thelaclc of agreement among the
two upper classes cls to the proper
design for such a pin, we believe that
a new design will be preferable to
either or the two previously voted up-
on.

We thereiore wish to present the
iollowing advantages or pin number
live» This pin co m blues the
characLerisLio features or No. 1 and
No. 2 and is adesign at. once simple
and representative It does not con-
ﬂict, as rnanyliare maintained, with
the Honor Cr. pins, [or it is a smaller
pin, the design is rlilIerenL, and with
slight modiﬁcation it could be made
so distinct as not to allow any
possibility of Confusion. It does not
infringe upon the rightsof the Board
at Athletic Control, because the G

collage emblem, and the present
HonorG pins are simply a modiiica
Lion of this Emblem. As appears
from the Sr; \BLE‘J’ and BLACK of Novr

at the [0p [0 d' Linguish the pills
worn by the successful athletes. The
first design was intended to be it
permanent alumni pin and as such
was adopted by the next, LWO grazluas
iing classes The same design was
also used as a class pin by the classes
0f1902 and 190-1. It has been used
continuously as the college emblem
upon the general reception cards, up-
on college stationary and the SCARLET
AND BLACK and other publicario'iis,
and cannot therefore be regarded as
exclusively an athletic emblem, or

it seems to us then the iact that lour

adopted ihis design as an alumni pin,
