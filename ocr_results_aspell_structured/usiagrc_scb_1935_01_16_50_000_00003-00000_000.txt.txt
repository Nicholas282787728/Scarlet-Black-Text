By PAT GALLAGHER

let's hope that Grinnell can crack
Creighton ior cage deteat No. 1 on
Friday so that the Drake game on
Monday will have a peneet setting.
Without any real incentive, the Bull.
dogs and Pioneers have managed ior
some years now to put up a pretty in.
teresting battle every time they've met.
it would be worth the price oi a World
Series ticket to see them go to it with
the conierence leadership at stake.

The only time that a Grinncli
team has really scored a Creighton
iive was in 1930, when the Jays
eked out a 21.20 win. Grinneil
was leading up until the iinnl min.
utes when a tree throw, made on
a technical ioul, gave the Omaha
ﬁve the verdict. That year, as in
many years past, they had a man.

Grinneil center sought to bother
