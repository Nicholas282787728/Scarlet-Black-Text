what docs a college education do
tor a person after graduation? The
diicstion is often asked but is seldom
answered in a comprehensive way.

In an attempt to iorlnulnte an ex-
prc, ion of the sentiment of Griuueli
alumni in regard to this question The
Scarlet and Black has sent letters to

Griuucil graduate, This question was
asked thelnijllst how rairiable was
their college training in woik after
college days were over. From the rec
mics winch have been icccircd the
conclusion is reached that old Grin—
nclliaiis without 'ccptioll are of the
opinion that their college training in
ciiniicli has been invaluable to them
in later life.

Among the alumni who have icplicd
to tire request of The scarlet and
Black are rcpicscntcd marry occupa
tions and professions. Brit in regard
to the value of a collcgc tr
latcr lilc it seems that no particular
line at work has greater need of col-
lege graduates than any olhcr. From
’lllc expressions of thc alumni it can
be asserted that a college education
aids any person in any field of en»

It is often said that a college educar
lion is of little value as a training for
business. But the expression of prom—
inent business men among the alumni
'of this college seems to disprove this
assertion. Among the business men
who replied to‘ the inquiry sent by The
Scarlet and Black were w. A. ‘Mcll-
ratli of Rddvillc, Saskatchewan. Rob'r

w. A. hlclli-ath is head of a retail
lumber conccrii in Radville. in his
answer to the one , put by The Scan»
lot and Black he says that the help
nlrich a college training giv ,- a. man
in aftci- life is something intangible,
much harder to express than that
something which we know as the Gr \7
llell Spirit. To quote from his letter
“Atl‘lleti , as taught at Gl'iuncll, is a
bettcr training for business than we
ever imagine during our student days.
The track man * first taught to free
himself from everything that might in
any way impcdc his specd, then learn

with the gun and keep going regard-
less- or what happens," He further
salt “The faith that we learn to have
iii men at Griuncll gives us a stronger
faith in the men who happen to be our
neighbor in later years and we trope
that the spirit gained at Glinnell has
inicii us ideals that enable our nciglr
bots to have more faith in us.

.1. Stuart Russell of Newton is of
the opinion that a college education
and training can he of the greatest
benefit to a farmer. Mr. Russell is a
recent gl'ddilzlte of Grinncll and has
been cngaged in farming only a few
years. us says: “Many people have
the impression that any iguorainus
can bc a successful farmer and that
brawn rather than bi-ariis is a requisite
for this occupation. This impression
'is certainly erroneous, for the sllccess<
.firi farmer necds business judgment.

Grinnell has to offer. at what I

nell 1 reillembel' but a very little por.
from it seems to me that what one
learns from the curriculum is less Im-
portant than the fact that he has learn—
ed how to learn.”

it is always taken for grantcd that
a college education is essential as a
foundation for work in any of the pro—
fesston. The number of profession-
,sl men today who have not laid the
lfoundation for. their work in a college
training is negligible.

The statement of a prominent east-
ern educator, who is a graduate of
Grinnell, is Valuable in that it men<
tions factors figuring in his Griunell
training which the statements from
businessmen have not emphasized. In
concluding his letter to The Scarlet
and Black he says, "Now these are not
all the things that might be said, and
i realize that they can perhaps all be
set as sub-headings to that great word
lpeinocracy which President Main has
‘given and is giving a very real mean-
;iiig among you. Of course Grinnell
did the many other things that any
_collogc of good standing does for its

we think of Grinncll,"
