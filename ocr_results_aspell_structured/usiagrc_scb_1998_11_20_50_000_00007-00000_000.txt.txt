Football team chemistry makes
for quite an explosive season

Magden: “It is definitely a unique chemistry that this team
has. . . | thinkit's an extension of the Grinnell ideology of
accepting everybody and taking that into account as far as
what the whole represents.”

Team. Websrer's dicrionary defines ii .is.
“[A] number ofpcrsons associared rogerlier in
work or activity: as a group on one side."

Members of rhe uridefeared conference
champion pioneer foorball ream had anoiher
dehnirion for mm: rliis year, riiough. Simply
pm, Mary were a ream

According so rlre players, a large parr ofrhe
reams success came from the unique brand of
chemisrry rlrar made rhe pioneers a mic ream,
seniors who have played foorbail here since
rheirarrivai said rhis ream had a chemisrry like
no other; Htst-ycat players said rliey were in.
spired by rhe uniry and focus ofrhe ream.

“The ream chemisrry was unbeliembie all
year," linebacker Josh Rehmann ’00 said “\‘i/c
were rhe closesr unit 1 have ever been around,
We lifred, pracriced, are, lived and even pat-
ried rogerher, We knew each game we would
find a way ro win,"

Rehmann’s commenr provides a valuable
clue rhar reveals where riie tcum's on-held
chemisttyith: one rhar helped rhcm ﬁnd a
way ro win—came from. The off-ﬁeld cama.
raderie ofrhe ream was a facsor poinred ro by
many ream members as a key pare ofrhe reams
success.

“prerry much everybody on she ream gor‘

along wish everybody else. You could find ev.
erybody hanging outwith anybody else abour
any rime ofrhe day," linebacker Josh Magden
'99 said,

Fitsteycar wide receiver Brad Orcmland YOZ
agreed. “A lor of rhe guys hang our rogrrlier
ourside offoorbali. Really, almosr everyone is
friends offrhe field," he said. “We really funCv
rioned as a unir rhis year, and chars definirely
one ofrhe keys ro our success."

Burl-low did she friendships away from rlie
field rranslare ro success dun ng games? Magden
said rhar rhe friendships helped rhe ream to
rhink of rhemseives as a unit rarher rhan as

many play

“Is is definirely a unique cireirilsri—y rhar
rhe rearri has ,. l rhiuk it's an exrension ofrhe
Grinnell ideology ofaccepringeverybody and
raking rhar inro accounr as far as whar rhe
whole represenrs," Magden said.

A second key ro rhe ream'swinning chem.
isrry this season was irs focus on a common
goal.

“This year (the ream) was a special group
of guys working for a common goal. 1 rhink
we all undersrood rhar," wide receiver Rich.
nrtl WCIHCI' '9‘) saitl.

Defensive back/punrer sian Banks ’99
agreed rhar focus was a major hieror to borh
rhe ream ehemisrry and so rhe undefeared scar
son.

“Our focus each week was jusr on rise up.
poirenr we were playing rhar week. I drink rhar
enabled us ro go rindefeared," Banks said.

ir was rhc focus on each challenge rhe ream
faced rhar helped deﬁne rhc reams arrirude.

"\Y/c rook rhe games one or a rime, didn‘t
ger overly fired up and jusrwenrour each Sar-
urday and rook care ofwhar we needed ro do,"
Rehmann said

Camaraderie and focus were nor rhe only
rwo rngredienrs in me team’s recipe for good
chemisrry, rhough. banks said rhar each

placed on him also conrribuied so ream chem.
isrry,

“A lor ofrimes you see a ream rhar gers in
a hghr wirh each orher or a fighr breaks our
over a posirion: he said. “I think she players
realized rhar it didn't marrer ifdiey gar ro play
all rhe rime or ifrheyweren’r playing rhe posi.
rion rhey wanred ro be.

“They jusr wanred ro do whar was besr for

players are quick so poinr out rhar rhey
were not rhe only ones who wanred whar was
besr for rhe ream. Many said rhar rhe reams
coaches conrriburcd as much ro rhe team's
chemisrry as rhe players.

“I drink riie coaches have done jusr a won-
derful job wirh lis,"W¢m:rsaid. “Wewenr inro
games againsr Ripon, where as an arhleric
school, or Monmoudi, where as primarily arh.
lcres, and we were able ro win .It’s jusr amar.
ing whar rhe coaches do."

In much rhc same way as Werner and his
fellow upperclassmen said rhey could asrribuse
much ofrhe reams chemissry ro she coaching
sraff. younger players gave credir ro rhe uppcr—
classmen for rlreir abiliry ro lead rhe ream and
give ir rhe iiirangible spark rhar ignired victo-
ties.

“This years seniors were a group of jusr
exceprional leaders," Oremiand said, “I’m srrli
blown away by how rhey really srepped up and
made rhis ream rheir own."

Regardless of whar sources the reams ex.
eeprional chemisrry came from, players said it
paid off in many ways. The mosr obvious is
rhe Pioneer’s undefeared season and conference
championship,

Wemer poinred our anorher payofrfrom rhe
ream's chemisrry, “Not only is rhis going ro help
as far as recruiring is concerned. .bur l rhink
rhar (rhe ream chemisrryi is an erhic ihar is in.
srilled in rhe ream now and i think ir is going
ro continue," he said.

The inrarigiblc erhic rhar has been insrilled
in pioneer foorbali is only one ofrhe rewards
rhe ream has reaped rhanks in large parr ro irs
arrirude. Rehmann nored anorher payoffand,
ar rhe same rime, summed up jusr why rhe
pioneers chemisrry made ir a ream rhis season.

“An example ofrhe ream’s chemisrry can be
seen when you look in rhe rrophy case and see
ours sirring rhere," Rehmann said. “you don’t
win championships wirh individuals bur with
people who know how ro play rogerher."

This knowledge efhow ro play rogerhere
rhis ream chemisrry_cerrainly benefired rhe
pioneer ream rhis season.

And if rhe same chemisrry conrinues,
Webster’s may have ro updarc rheir carry for
ream ro, “See Gtinnell Pionecrs."

now rhar you are here?
