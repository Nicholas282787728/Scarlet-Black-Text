Meet the friendly grocer

by Ted Price

Tuesday, I went to the {our
major grocery stores in town to
examine how they would [are when
lheir prices for identical products
were compared. The results which
are listed adjacent show that
sometimes it pays to shop around.

An interesting highlight to my
investigation was the harrassrnent
1 experienced from the store
managers As soon as l pulled out
my pencil and notepad. the
managers became panicky.

At Hy-Vee, which was my iirst
stop, the store manager came up
and asked me what l was doing. i
told him that I was from Grinnell
College and then mumbled
something about a project. That
momentarily eased his doubts and
I beat a hasty retreat.

The next store I Visited was

market: the manager came up to
me (out oi earshot from other

customers) and said, “who are you‘

working for?” I replied that I was
[rpm the College and he breathed a
sigh ot relief. “I thought you were a
price checker,” he inlormed me. I
gave him my best look oi naive
innocence and hurriedly left.

My last stop was McNally‘s,
where i also received the evil eye,
but I managed to throw them all
the track by buying a box of Dash
that I really did not want, which
ended my investigative jaunt.

Aword ofcaution: before looking
the Chart over, I would like to
remind the reader that these prices
may vary on any given day from
store to store Consequently, no
generalizations as to which Store is
the best are intended. To get the
most for your money you should
see which supermarket is having a
