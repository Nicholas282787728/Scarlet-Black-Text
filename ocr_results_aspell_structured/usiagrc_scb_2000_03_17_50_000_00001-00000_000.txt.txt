Biochemical evolution

New Biological Chemistry major to be introduced next fall

By Michael Andersen
Slofl erier

After several years of what Science Division
Chair Brueo Voyles called a “vory impressive ex»
ample otinrordoprrrmenral sooporarion" bcrwccn
the biology and chemistry departments, the class
of 2004 will come to Grinnell faced with a thor-
oughly retooled gene: or inrrodusrory courses in
the sciences and an onrirely new choice or mayor,

Th: changes, rargsrod toward students inrore
ested in both biology and chemistry (such as
prcmcds), attempt prima.
rily ro lessen the course
burden on undeclared un»
dcrclassmen, who are now
required ro tak: one full
year each or introductory
biology and chemisrry if
rhry are urrsmpring to
choose between the two

Under rho ricw program, inrorosrsd students will
take one semester ouch oF“Biologirzl Inquiry" and
“General Chemistry;w thus: new Courses will ems
phasize general morhods orprasrico in laboratory
sclencc rarhcr than run through large amounts or

The two introductory sessions will be the prc»
requisires {or a pair ofthirdrserncstcr Classes that
probo dccpcr inro each subject, Only in the Fourth
semester will students be required to Spcclaillt in
their choice orbrology, chemistry, or the newly ap»
proved biological clicmistry.

Voylos, who is a biology professor and soanu—
thar of the new curriculum, said the two depart»
menrs had “been working for a number oryears
now ro create moro nexibihry in the hrsr yorr,..,
Biology and Chemistry have worked rogerher hard

on rhis to give up on some orrheir turf, whlch is
pretty impressive, because when i got here 23 years
ago bio and chem weren't speaking to each other."

Voylcs is especially positivc about the new in.
rrodusrory classes. “They should be lust
gangbustcr," he said. “The focus is on having srua
dents go wherever rhe inquiry rakes them." The
proposed course is similar ro a pilor course from
iasr year, which also had a ﬂuid, ruroriahliku for»
mar. Each section will have u dirroronr topic, Kal-
lored ro the individual prorossor's inrcresrs,

Janeey Wickstrom ’03 expressed concern rhar
“none ofihc students righr now know whar's going
on" and encouraged raouhy to make available a more
rhorough discussion orrho way the new curricur
lum will unorasr wirh the old.

Unronunaroly, current students interested in the
new biological rhomisrry major are “out afluck,"
in voyles‘s words Due us the tremendous differ—
ences borweon the old and new curricula, indepen-
dcnlly minded biologrsrs and chemists from 2003
on back will probably have ro make do with a smat-
roring orsoursrs from a non-major discipline. In-

however, bo permitted and encouraged us take rho

Almost half of RLCs to leave

Turnover rate of three out of seven RLCs is not abnormal, but still will cause problems

By Chris Neory

A year after eliminarion ofan Resldenr Life
coordinaror posinon was one orrhe horresr topics
on campus, no fewer than halFof Grinnell’s RLCs
are quietly planning to leave the school before the
start ofrhe nuvr academic year.

Caryn Rogimbni, Howe Siege] and Nick Myers
have already committed ro leaving error rhis May,
While every open posirion is certain in be ﬁlled for

will clearly have an effect on student life.

“There is a rorrainly a luck or sonrinuiry, and
rhars rarely holprul, bur rhe RLCs position is only
meant ro be u rwo year posirion," said Myers, who
will loavo to pursue his PhD. in sporrs Psychol
ogy. “it's an onrrylovrl posirion and l don'r rhink
people could do u for more than 2 ro 3 years It’s

rough ro live in the rcsldcnce halls."

Rogimbul echoes Myors‘s sentiment concerning
the dimculry or living in dormitories, She is dc-
parring for another job in student
advising, She also tools that
crinnsll's geographic isolation can
be a srruin, sh: sald, “I rhink you
really need ro sray for more rhrn a
