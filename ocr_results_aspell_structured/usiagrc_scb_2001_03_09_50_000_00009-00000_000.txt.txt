Dear Edirors,

Regarding rhe response ro my random raiir: rlic

coiisisrenr wirlr rheir responsibiliries as a commniiiry
srore, and, moreover. is one of rho accepted rishs rhe
underage purehaser rims. The disgusting parr, and rhe
inspirarion ror my rear, was what happened AFTER
rhc police were involved.

Rather rhan merely noriiyiiig rhe local law on
foreemenr officials char a crime was being ariernpred,
and rhen leaving ir in rhc hands orsaid emerals, Hy.
vee decided, npparenrly, ro ”make an example“ of
"Johnny," rhe srudenr in quesrion. The police were
willing ro ler rhe srudenr orrwirh a warning, bur Hy-
vec insisred on pressing eharges. Such a move, l feel,
ovcrsreps rheir responsibiliry ro ihe community. Hy»
vee was cssenrially sorring irselr higher than the po-
