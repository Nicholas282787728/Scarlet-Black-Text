It was a combination of arias with
no regard for the story. Wagner.
on the other hand, held that form
must be determined by the nature
at the thought, not by ﬁxed lair-s.
He also made an innovation from
the current opera in the choice of
his subjects, which were largely
mythological, while the prevail-
ing ones wcrc historical. Wag-
ner‘s conception ot the orchestra
was that it should take the place
of the chorus in Greek drama,
that is, as interpreter. Tllis he ctr
[acted by means of waif/x. Prof,
Cole illustrated quite at length
and very instructively Wagner's
use or descriptive rim/27s, each ot
which represents some character
or phase at the action.

The program as a whole. was
one of the most pleasing and in
structivc held tor a longtime.
The societies wish to thank Prof.
Cole for his valuable talk, and also
Miss Rew, Miss Hill and Miss
Proctor for the beautrtnl music
which added so much to the pro
gram.

Chrestomathian.

Owing to the play, Saturday.
March 24th, the meeting of the
Chrestomathian society was post-
poned until Wednesday evening.
The mid-week session seemed to
lower the attendance.

The program was commendable
tor its brevity. It was opened
with a solo by Miss McCornack,
her music being highly appreciate
ed by the society, as was shown
by the hearty applause, to which
she kindly responded with an en-
core. Mr. Owen then gave a so-
liloquy, which was not only enter-
taining, but it furnished an insight
into that which a student has to

contend with. Miss Satterleeihen

manner. M. J. Meade extempol'»
lzed on Compulsory Chapel. He
spoke to the point, ﬁrst giving
cause and then the effect that it
is having on the strident body.
The question for debate was,
“Resolved, That there should be
a National Divorce Law.” Bair
put forth a strong argument for
the uFﬁlmative, giving evidcncc
that he had spent much time and
thought on the subject. Mr. Ar-
nold supported the negativeﬁhotw
ing much ability as a debater.
The debate was lull of spirit from
the beginning to the end.
Although the program was
short. in quality it takes its place
among the best at the term.
