Master barbe

By Joshua Ford

Except for a Stint in the armed
services and a two year apprentice-
ship as a barber in Des Moines, Jim
Miller has spent his entire life living
and working in Grinnell. For the last
45 years, he has run a barber shop on
Main Street,cutting thehairoftowns-
people and college students alike.
More than one student has stories to
tell of being groomed by “Gender
man"Jim. This January.hewillretire

he has sat for the last 32 years.

From this vantage point as both
small-town politician and commu-
nity landmark, he has observed the
“town-gown”relationshipoveraspan

few ineitherthe college or towncomr

“My ﬁrst impression of the col-

You might have kind ofa basic re-
sentment of the college, because
here’s people coming into town that
you don‘t know and strange people,
so until you get a little older, you
don’t really appreciate the economic
beneﬁt the college brings to the city,"
he said

He points across the street to The
Bar, the main alcohol sewing attrac-

for many residents of the town.

He suggested the reopening of a
bar on campus which existed before

He also responded to charges lev-
eled at the town community by sev-
eral African and African-American
students on campus regarding the
ueatment they receive in the town.

“One time several years ago. a
group of colored students came to the

SGA works for town—gown harmony

By Julie Pecaut

The relationship between a pole
lege and the town in which it is
located is important to college life.
Anegativetown-gownrelationship
prevents the college and the town
from beneﬁting from one another.

Grinnell‘s student government,
in an effort to maintain positive
connections between the college and
the town of Grinnell, has planned
events designed to bring college
studentsand townresidents logelhel’,

SGA vice president Minnie
Alexander explained one imponant
program lmplemcnwd last year —
the Youth Relations Organization.
“This program tried to reach out to
high school students in Grinnell,
We sponsored a party at the high
school, and we tried to make it so

that they knew that we had spon-
sored it, but they were not intimi-
dated by us," she said.

According to Alexander, SGA
intends to renew this program, but
has yet to start it this year. SGA
also has plans for other town-gown
programs.

“Another thing we're going to
try to do this year is to get high
school students to participate in
campus organizations, to get them
involved [in campus life],” said
Alexander.

In addition to these programs in
the works, SGA has already made
their presence visible to town resi-
dents by riding in Lthrinnell High
School homecoming parade. 011
floors of SGA rode on a ﬂoat and
passed out candy from two scoot-
ers.

come downtown and we get waited
on too quick in the stores...bccause
thcywantto getrid of us. So they wait
on us real quick so we can get out the
door.’ Now that‘s out in left
field...most stores you go into you
don't get waited on quick enough."
l-Ie attributed thestudcnts‘ complaints
of verbal abuse in the bars to the
affects ofalcohol inl'lamtng tensions.

More generally he claimed that,
“A black person. forget the college
person, a black person can come to
Grinnell and walk down the street
and not have no problem. People
speak to him, say good morning, hi
and whatever. Butyou take thewhite
person going into theblack neighbor-
hood. and sec who gets discriminated

' black person doesn’t get
discriminated against here, we’re not
going to give him any trouble.”

As for the liberal political views
historically held by the college com-
munity. Millerexpressed understand-
ing if not total agreement. In panicu-
lar he recalled last year’s demonstra—
tionagainstGovemorBranstad,when
the republican governor was blockr
aded in his local campaign headquarr
ters while students protested his anti-
abortion and prordeath penalty posir
lions.

“Our mayor, a strong republican,
said at the city council meeting that
peoplecamcuptohimandsaid,‘Wcll
I was going to vote against Branstad,
but now I‘m going to vote for him
because I didn’t like what the college
kids did.‘ But when the vote came,
Branstad lost Grinnell; he only car»
ried one ward out of fourt"

Miller expressed a genuine affec~
tion for students at the college, both
those currently attending and those
stretching back through his lifetime
at Grinnell.

“90% of the college students I
have associated with have been nice
young ptxiple, no problem. Some—
times in the past, kids come out here
from the east coast. thinking that eve
erybody in town isarctired farmeror
something like that which is not true.
You know and I know you can get
dingraelings at a college as well as
you can get nice people at the
college..,My overall impression of
college kids, is they‘ve been real nice
young people, polite and well man-
nered. Even the years, ten years ago,
when everybody had hair down to
their neck and nobody got a haircut,
they were still nice people.”

As concreteproof of the good feel-
ings he belicvcs exist between the
college and the town, he pointed to
thefundraisingsuccessol'the“'l“own-
Gown Project," and a business card
given to him by a graduate when he
returned for his 30th reunion. The
card was inscribed, “A former cus-
tomer. Class of 1960,"

“30 years, the kid remembers...
How’sayoungman whogoesoffinto
life and yet 30 years later remembers
a little barber out here in Grinnell,
Iowa. Now that's nice young people.
How can you have anything against
thar’.7 How would he remember me
thirty years later? I don’t remember
my barber from thirty years ago. for
chrissakcs. That’s what I call nice
people,” Miller laughed.
