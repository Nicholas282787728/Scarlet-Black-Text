incident which occurred in the

title already in the bag, it Seem»

Entire Tennis Team Takes Sing/ta: Cro wns

By Bill McClung

The powerful pioneer tcnnis
team completely dominated last
weekend’s court play while par
rading to the most decisive vic—
tory in the history of the con—
ference meet. Grinnell swept all
four singles championships, won
the ﬁrst doubles championship
and was runnerrup in the sec-
and doubles competition. Thc
meet was staged in Ripon, Wis,
last Friday and Saturday.

Coach lrv Simone's foursome
of conference champs-Bill Hahn,
Dick Katz, Jim Hautzinger and
John Copeland—is conceivably
the most outstanding team that
has ever represented any Mldr
west conference school. it is the

 

Dick Kaiz, Grinnell’s unde-
feated number two player, mov-
ed into the ﬁnal round by pol.
ishing away Reinsberg of Mona
mouth sel, 6-1 and Reed of
Knox 6-2, s. in the quarter—
ﬁnal and semiﬁnal rounds. He
faced Mirisch oi Ripon in the
final round. They split sets les,
64 and it was 2.2 in the third
set when Mirisch was unable to
continuc due to cramps and fa.
tigue irom the long day on the
courts. Katz won the match by
default to take the champion—

ﬁrst team that has ever Swept a

the singles, and its point total
of 23 out of a possible 24 is unr
precedented. Of course, the rela—
tive strength of conference corn»
petition from year to year is
nearly impossible to determine

Millar. ~

Bill Hahn, Grinnell’s num-
ber one player who was re-
cently voted the roost valu-
able player on the team by
his teammates, met his tough-
est competition ln the open-
ing round. He faced arid beat
Carleton’s Jim Priest in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. in the
semi-ﬁnal round he passed
(Joe’s Buchniueller 6-1, H to
move into the ﬁnal round
with top-seeded Kleber from
st. mar. Kleber had beaten
Hahn in earlier competition,
hut Hahn managed to control
the match to the onesided
tune of 6-3, 6-2 to wintl-iecon.

However, it was only a medi~ ,
ocre attempt and Cowles placed .

third in the relay and took
third place in the meet.

I think that it is universal-
ly agreed that everyone on.
mires an athletic team or m-
dividiial who puts forth the
maximum amount of effort in
an athletic contest, but it is
a completely different story
when someone else‘ is hinder-
ed troni doing his best, In this
reporter’s eyes, it was simply
a case of very poor sports-
manship. 1 hope everyone in.
volved has come to rcaliaetliis
fact.

On the softball scene, pre-
viously undefeated Rawson fin-
ally met its match in a deter-
mined Cowles team. Rawson’s
last ditch attempt to win in the
last inning was stopped one run
short and the final score was
Cowles 12. Rawson 11, How-
ever, the game is under protest
and will be played today start—
ing in the fifth inning with
Cowles leading, 12-5,
