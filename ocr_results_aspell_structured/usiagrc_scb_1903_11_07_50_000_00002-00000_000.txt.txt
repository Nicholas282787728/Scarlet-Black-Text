(BODAY we meet the toothall

Grim-tell,

team which has proved
itself so tar this season one of the

two Strongest aggregations in the‘

state. A week hence our men are
to face the other one. Drake has
never failed to play whirlwind foot-
ball at the close of a season. We
are assured moreover that her
team of 1903 has beaten all records
.in the Christian university for
rapid development, and a glance
at the calendar assures us that No-
vember 14 will see the blue and
white at the climax of its : '

condition. “Drake," says

Duly/u}. “never had two better
coaches and trainers than \\'m. J.
MonilawttntljllllusBacon.” Grin.
nell people, however, are indebted
to the efforts of Manager Cole
and to the gene osily of the Rock
Island for an opportunity of Seeing
one of Drake's hard games this
year and lending our men the sup-
port they deserve. A simple pIOv
cess in arithmetic Shows how
cheap will be the tickets to Des
Moines. A little experience has
taught us how much rooting can
help, and a little conjecture sug
gests how much will be the need
of rooting thcre, Let us all plan
to make Des Moines next Satur-
day and see that as many oi our
friends accompany u= as are needr

ed to mike a great delegation of
meters.

LOW RATE TO DES MOTNES.

Drake Game may be Seen [or a Small
Sumisign at Rustls.

The authorities in charge of
the matter have secured a rate ol
Lgo [or the trip to Des Moines
next Saturday. on account of the
Dralcchrinnell game to be held
there, providing two hundred
make the trip. Manager Cole
desires that those who intend to
go shall sign up at Rust‘s as early
as possible. The Drake game
has always been one of the most
interesting contests of the season.
