As was expected, the lioiue meet Sate
urdsy developed early in the afternoon
into a struggle between the sopho-
niores it_nd juniors l'ox' premier honors
which was close at all times and not
decided until almost tiie end of the

meet, when it was seen that once more
'09 had amassed a lead whieii it was

impossible for her competitors to over
take. The freshmen showed a great
increase or strength over the previous
Saturday and iinished close to the
leaders, while the academy and sene
iors did not ﬁgure prominently.

The stunts which have become a
recognized, feature of home meets
were especially well .planned and the

juniore’ band, the sophomore general
procession, and the freshman ﬂoat all

deserve mention for their clever exee
('utioll, although not ‘teeniiug with ma
iginalitx.

The lull-yard dash, the ﬁl"L event,
went to Huff, '09; Turner, '11, and
Barnes, '11, in the order named, in
the slou time of 1b 445 seconds, which
is partially explained by the fact that,
through a mistake, a course of 105
yards was run.

forted by Carter, '09, to a height of
10 feet :1 inches to win, thus estab.

Successful Concert.

The Girls' Glee Club made its ﬁrst
public appearance Friday night before
a crowded house in New Sharon and
more than justiﬁed the expectation
that Grilmell can produce two kinds
of music that everybody likes. The
steadiness with which the Club over—
came a ﬁrst natural nervousness and
the enthusiastic reception their sluge
lug received augurs well tor the future
of the new organization. The Bridal
Chorus from ”The Rose Maiden," and
“What the Chimney Sang" were per-

Excellent solo numbers were given

delightfully entertained atr a two-

Director Pierce is hopeful for the
future successes or the new club, and
under his supervision it is safe to
predict many more triumphs like that
or last night.
