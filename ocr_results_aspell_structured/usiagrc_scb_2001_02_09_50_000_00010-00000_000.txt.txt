SGA not so bad

its nice ro see rhar rhings haven‘t changed in rlie 30 years
since i wear ro college (no, nor Grinnell). The SGA then had
irs own agenda, and ran rhings as rhey saw in. The borrom line
was we couldn't ger anywhere near a so perccnr interest in is.
sues, and obviously the numbers at Grinncll ar besr hover around
rhe so pereenr ﬁgure. Let‘s rare ir. many times students are
inr ed in srudying, making a raw bucks. and socialising. so
what's wrong wirh that) it just rcilccrs rhe electorate or rhis
counsry rhar doesn'r turn our ro vote in airy greater numbers
when rhere are even real issues arsrake. Don'r be so hard on rhe
SGA. i‘m sure rhey're no worse rhan mosr other son's across
rhecounrry.

What would Arthur do?

My English class only has 12 people in it and the
room we were assigned contains an oblong circular

shape which everybody is intended tc sit around but .

which was designed to seat more than twice as many
or us as there are, So we cluster on one end or the
table and the teacher sits at the other and we talk at
her. And it makes me wonder if my group orrriends has
somehow round its way around the wrong size table,
and then it makes me wonder how many other sets or
people have been looking ror shelter irom the cold, or
at least from grurr professors, and in huddling close to
each other rejected the opportunity not only to deny
the authority ortho problem that's bringing them to
gether but to look each other in the eyes when they
speak.

Bogus book pncs
I’d be very appreciative ir Grinnell College could
accurately, oreven semi-accurately, reportthe cost of
books. The admissions information recommended that
students anticipate book costs ranging ‘rO‘Tl $200 to
3300 dollars each semesten This semestt‘n I spent
$550 on required books All books that were available
used, I purchased used. It 1 were expenelicing some
freak price skyrocketing trend in the bookstore, per.
haps I could rationalize such a discrepancy, but i’ve
spoken with several other people who've also spent
over $500 on a semester’s hookss Iﬁnd the discrep-
ancy between the real and "projected" costs of books
astonishing and disturbing. Is the misleading ﬁgure
printed in admissions brochures an intentional mis-
representation or ignorance orthe current book costs?
Either way, something should he done. Thanks!
