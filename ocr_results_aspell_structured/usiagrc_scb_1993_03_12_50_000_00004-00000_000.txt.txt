TITULAR HEAD

Your mother never told you it could be this good.

By Sharyn Obsatz

r I 1ITULAR MEAD will be like
nothing you’ve ever seen
before (especially if you

didn’t go last year).

That zany festival of student
mademovies isback.1thaunts uslike
the unappeasable ghost of Grinnell‘s
glorious past. Perhaps one of Grin—
nell‘smostcherishedtradjtjons,Titu-
lar Head was originally conceived
more titan a decade ago as a talent

show to kick off that other great
dmrtken orgy, the Grinncll relays.

After a revival last spring, Titu-
lar Head is boldly pressing forward,
prodding students to take up their
cameras and document,cnquue, and,
if you will, ridicule society and all
that is quintessentially Grinnell.

This year’s installment of Titu-
lar Head madness will be April 10 in
the Hanis gym. Doors open at 9 pm.
and the ﬂicks start at 9:30. Don’tbe
the only person on your ﬂoor to miss
this momentous event.
