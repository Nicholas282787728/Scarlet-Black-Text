Since the completion oi Clark Hall in
1978, there has been an unceasing flow
of criticism about the qualities oi the
renovation projects. Students have
complained of a “hotel-like” at-
mosphere, sterile and uninviting being
the chief qualities of renovated dorms
like James, Main, and Clark.

Others complain that the beauty of
the old dorms, particularly the
materials with which they were con-
structed, have been lost with the new
fabrications. Students preferred the
original plasoer walls to the new dry
walls; they liked the old bathrooms
with the marble partitions and tile
ﬂoors

As the renovation project has been
one of “build and learn," there has
been response to some of these com»
plaints. The ongoing renovations have
retained the original Stairways and
the old marble partitions have been
cut to make window sills which are
truly elegant.

Langan, like Clark, has some lovely
arched windows; these are intact. as
are most of the original walls. Like
Main, Langan has dark wood paneling
and a huge iireplace in the lounge.
Special panels will fit over the original
woodwork and columns to protect the
worn areas and still preserve the
homey ambience of the lounge.

The original floor of the lounge is in
remarkably good condition and will be
carpeted along With the hallways, Ina
dividual rooms, the stairways, and the
smooth, brick tile floor in the base-

ment will be left uncarpeted.
Ted Lovejoy, a college trustee who

recently retired irom a career in con-
struction, offers his time gratis to the
college to supervise the renovations.
He gets a little milted and confounded
by student complaints sometimes.

“It bothers me when kids come
along and complain." Lovejoy said.
He noted that most students demand-
ed that the old plaster walls he retain-
as they were in Clark, but then
complain when the plaster splits and
fissures as if it was the lault of
renovation. So then he puts up dry
wall and gem complaints of its
unaesthetic appearance and the hollow
sound it makes when students lly into
the hallway walls, diving for a frishee.

“No one realizes what terrible shape
the dorms were in," Lovejoy explains
ed. Some of the renovation actions
may not be ideal, but lor the money
and the tinal product, he says, the
renovations are the best they can be.

“A building,” Loveioy pointed out,
”is not a perfect thing."

He also stressed the quality of the
materials used: $550 for each door and
frame assembly, 542 for each stainless
steel mirror, and no spared expense
on appointments and ﬁxtures.

But what about the quality of
workmanship? Lovejoy contends that
you can never be fully satisfied with
the workmanship. He said he can walk
into any building and iind things that
could have been done better.

Allin all, however, he maintains
that the dorms will he a lasting invest»
ment for the college.

“They ought to last as long as the
original buildings,” Luvejoy said.

There are still imperfection , ol-

Renovations preserve old in the new

lege students do lead rowdy lives and
damage has already been done to the
renovated dorms, But this is not the
fault oi the renovation project, unless
we would have them build padded
steel cabinets for us.

While the dorm renovations may not
meet with everyone's approval, Loves
joy is quick to point out that the
money for renovations comes almost
completely Irom trustee gifts. He
doesn’t think students have much
right to complain about something
they don’t pay for directly

on the other hand, students do have
to live in the dorms; they might as
well like where they live,

That the renovated dorms are not
uninhabitable should tell us that things
Could be worse. At least we don’t have
to live in any of the state university
monstrosities. Then again, we do have
to suiier Norris Hall.

Wrestlers grapple with Iowa competition

by Rob Sldon

For decades, Iowa has been con-
sidered “the wrestling mecca oi the
US." Speculators maintain that
because Iowa does not host a profes-
sional team in the NFL, NHL, NBA,
etc., the support and enthusiasm has
been channeled homeward to the
younger athletes

Wrestling has been traditionally
well- received because the sport re-
quires a lot oi strength, speed, en-
durance, and hard work. Wrestling is
thought to build character; and by vir-
me or its structure, the sport is design-
ed to give every athlete an equal op»
portunlty to compete within his para

ticular weight and size class

So. brought up with the support or
parents and outside leagues, many a
young Iowan has successfully wrestled
his way though grade school and high
school, then gone on and achieved na
tional and world ranking. The Univer-
sity of Iowa and Iowa State consistent-
1y share the number one and two spots
in NCAA Division I wrestling. To an
Iowan, these wrestling teams are an
adored phenomenon, just as the Bulls,
Bears, or the Cubs are to a Chicagoan

Although it Is centered in the middle
of Iowa. Grinnell College does not
seem to capture the same enthusiasm
for wrestling as its surrounding rivals.

Grinnell attracts a geographically
diverse student population, and. as
such, Coach Ed Dombrowski feels his
wrestlers compete at a disadvantage
against other colleges (not neccssarily
as big as U oil, or lowa State) which
draw predominantly from Iowa high
schools,

As an undergraduate, Dombrowski
wrestled at Coe College, Since then, he
has coached the wrestling team at
Ripon College. Both teams are in
Grinnell’s conlerence and, as Dome
broski understands the competition, he
says, “It’s going to be tough."

The team wlll have its ﬁrst. meet at
the year this Wednesday against
