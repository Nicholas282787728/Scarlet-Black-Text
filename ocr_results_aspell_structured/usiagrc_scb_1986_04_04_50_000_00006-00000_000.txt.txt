Rastaiarian culture made by a young
Greek filmmaker with an unpatronizing
eye and an insider's ear (or the rhythms
and moods ol rockers (current slang tor

and in the lush surrounding hills, the film
is a joyful, irreverent mixture of fiction
and documentary, featuring a cast at
members of the reggae group Burning
Spear who more or less reenact their ac
tual experiences [or the‘camera.

Rockers crackles with Rasta Wit
(translated into English subtitles, which
add a new dimension of humor) as Leroy
“Horsemouth” Wallace, one of the island’s
leading drummersaresolves to Tight the
local mob's hoid OK the mu
enlisting the help of his fellow musicians
and ultimately playing Robin Hood
Jamaica-style to the people oi the ghetto,

to realize that there is‘ more , to a
Rastaiarian than wearing his hair braided
in “dreadlocks." The film includes such
reggae hits as Peter Tosh’s “Stepping
Razor," Bunny Wailer’s “Rockers."

Trapez d members: Ralph Gordon, Lorraine Duisii. Paul Keielcr and Freyda

Epstein

by Nori Wood

Trapezoid, a folk band from West
Virginia, appears Saturday, April 5 at a
pm. in South Lounge.

The group combines Iolk and jazz music
with a wide range of styles including Irish
iolk melody, chamber music, blues, jump,
swing, and American Iiddle tunes.

All four members of Trapezoi . Lora
raine Duisit, Ralph Gordon, Paul Reisler,
and Freyda Epstein have had classical
training, which, according to Reisler,
“allows Tapezoid to cast a variety oi
American musics in a manner ﬂ'lat is at
once progressive and traditional.” The
classical influence in Trapezoid's music
adds a truly unique dimension to their
sound.

Using such instruments as the mandola,
viola, cello, bass, hammered dulcimer,
guitar, and harmonica (among others, as
each member seems to have at least half a
dozen instruments at meir disposal) the
tour player-singers produce a complexity
of sounds and musical textures that echo

01

“Oral traditions, musical styles and in»
struments oi the group’s Appalachian
homeland and express contemporary
concerns.’

Trapezoid performs traditional folk
music with an added ﬂair as in “Do You
Love an Apple" and Louis Jordan’s “Ain't
Nobody Here But Us Chickens” and
original compositions by Duisit such as
“The Old Road to Maryland" and “The
Silverplume Waltz" from the group’s third
album, “Now Then."

Started in 1976 by four other artists,
Trapezoid has toured throughout the Us.
and Canada and periormed at numerous
festivals and on Canadian and American
television and radio. They have five
albums: “Trapezoid” (1976, Traditional
Records), “Three Forks of Cheat” (197B,
Rounder Records), “Now and Then"
(1980, Flying Fish Records), “Another
Country” (1982, Flying Fish Records), and
“Voices" (1985)
