T0 llle Blllllll‘:

TO the Board Di Trustees of Grinnell Col-
legs”.

I have this past weekend read the text of
your May 4. 1935, resolution regarding in-
vestment in corporations doing business in
South Africa. While I commend the steps
which you have taken, it is impossible to
avoid the conclusion that they constitute
an inadequate response to the overall
situation in South Alrica. I was particular»
ly dismayed to see that you diluted your
opposition to Apartheid by stating that
your policy “shall be implemented by the
Board in a manner so as not to have an un-
due adverse ailect upon the college's
securities portfolio".

I expect Grinnell college to be willing to
make short term linancial sacrifices in
order to reach moral goals which the Grin-
nell community agrees are of paramount
importance. Opposition to racism and
commitment to racial equality are such
moral goals.

1 am as dismayed by your willingness to
allow the college to continue to take rotits
which are engorged by the poli es ol
Apartheid as I would be iia member of my
own lamily accepted money gained
through fraud or dishonesty.

We who are part of the Grinnell com-

munity — alumni. students, and lriends oi-

the college a will respond to an appeal tor
funds to make good any shortiall suiiered
due to disinvestment in South Africa. Trust
us to support you. and the college, and
have the integrity to ceaseimmediatelyall
investments in Corporations doing
business in South Africa. To continue upon
your present course is to abdicate the role
cl providing moral leadership which the
Grinnell Community expects ol you, 7

without bounds. one could endlessly pur-

One or the most replicated expression
found in academia, and one of the most
ultimate realities sadly discovered by any
explorer. is that knowledge is simply a
spark in a room lllled with mirrors,
Reﬂection encourages reilection, ilr
lumination shadows the origin and
brightens the opposite. and the room
becomes alive with light.

To capture the quintessence ol these ex-
cited brilliances is difficult. once the pro-
cess has begun, it is impossible to stop its
repurcussions. The imminent danger is
blindness; the light will grow in intensity
proportional to the observer's delirium:
the more one loses track of the original
beam. the more likely he is to become
overwhelmed. The voracious cursors of

light penetrate and involve the past, attack
the present, and send echoes to every imr
aginable future, The magnitude of the in-
vestigation, like a scrutiny oi the sun,
causes perceptions to be blurred, even
when turning train the source. The
paradox, ol course. is that to arrive at
understanding, we cannot supercede
knowledge. but it is knowledge that ex
cacerbates our quest.

Some people. perhaps in the justified
maintenance oi sanity, are inclined to
simply shut the door behind them. allow-

popular media suggests that attempts to
understand only create problems, and that
we should “live tor the day.” Unlortunate-

One might argue that the endless
ll‘ustration resulting lrom the pervaswe
leehng ol neglect. the impression lllat

something is always omitted or iorgotten
and the subsequent continuation of
thought. is a limiting experience; without
some conviction, nothing can be ac-
complished, l acquiesce. but would also
contend that “cerebral spelunking” need
not always be lruitless.

Once there is an answer, there exists no
more need 7 no more desire — to continue
the search, like linally discovering where
the wallet was misplaced. One could travel
as tar as another universe to seek the
billtold; the only restrictions on the fancy
ol creativity are- our ”mind forged
manacles.” The possibilities ol discovery
are as endless as the paths that lead to
them. History is replete with examples of
discoveries that shouldn't have been con-
ceived and were considered heretical or
impossible: evolution. nuclear reactions,
polio vaccines, to name a minor traction.

Our society seems obsessed with the lan-
tastic, at least anything that is new and
pleasuretul. A pervasive fear. and a coin

might obstruct. detail. or corrupt this
ielicity also exists. We simply desire to en»
