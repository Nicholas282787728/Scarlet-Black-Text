Can you tell me a little bit about where
the idea for the ﬂags came From?

For me, quite simply, one ofthe main teas
sons I’m at Grinncll is because ofits Comm-1F
ment to internationalism overall and internan
tional student enrollment in particular. But I
was actually surprised when I got here that
there msn't a ﬂag gallery. Lots of campuses
have thein.To me it’s a really visual represen-
tation. You hear a student tour guide walking

through and they say, “Oh yes, we have these 7

students from these places.”I think this just
gives a whole different visual. And I think the.
space just cried out for something like that, yet
I like that it doesn’t [distract from] the space
either. It still feels very much like it’s part of
the budding. For me it was a way to really eel-
ebrate the international dimensions ofour stu-
dent body. We tried really hard to pull names
of dual citizens and permanent residents that
hold foreign citizenship so that it wouldn’tjust
reﬂect the international Smdcntsill‘lc gov,
ernmentndeﬁned international student popu~
lation. So it gave a whole new breadth to when
we say who our international students are, it
kind of grew that in a really interesting way.

How has the Rosenfield program been
involved?

It was [the Office ofInternat‘ional Student
Affairs] that initiated the whole dialogue and
then when we contacted Rosenﬁeld, we were
just' thrilled that they were excited about it.
And one of the early dilemmas was this whole
eoneepr ofdefining nationhood and we need
ed some faculty input on that. And we really
appreciated their interest in doing the panel
and opening up that dialogue.

so, how has the Roscnﬁcld program been
involved?

In the summer, Sarah Purcell was involved
in the discussions as we talked about how we
deﬁne nationaliry~we were originally talking
to colleague institutions, most of whom use the
United Nations as their primary ‘
source for nationhood for their
ﬂag displays. Actually, Miehael ‘ '

Sims [Director of Campus Cen-

ter Operations and Student Ac»

tivities] had the brilliant idea to

look at the International Olymv

pies Committee [100] and so

we started looking at what they

do and we've expanded ours to

include both the UN. and the

IOC. That allowed us to expand

our display. [.to] places that are represented on
campus but who dont ﬁt into the traditional
United Nations definition.

What do you hope non-international
students at Gi-innell will take away from the
Gallery?

' ’ I think all students at Grinnell are internar
tional.That's why we have the Us. ﬂag there.
That's why we worked really hard not to just
be looking at the governmentnidentiﬁed inter—
national, who’s on an F—l visa, which is who
this office is usually working with. Early on,
1 saw a srarernent that was describing the dis-

play as a celebration of international identity.
No, that's not what it is. It’s national identify
at the college.

Is there an ‘ng else you’d like to add?
As moth as we know that ﬂags can open
controversy] think they can also opcn some
really positive, valuable dialogue and eelehras
tion of culture and connection
and so that’s what we hope hap—
pens with it. I think, as much as
this office has been spearhead-
ing the planning process, I don’t
think in any sense that we want
to feel ownership of the gallery
ofﬂags.l thinkthis is an institu—
tional celebration.

The main thing that 1 hope
gets across is our enthusiasm for
celebrating the diversity of our

student body. To me, the voice over this sums
met that was the most powerful all along was
that from the international students we talked
to who were so thrilled at the idea of walk-
ing into the [Spencer] Grill and having their

'own ﬂag hang. And I think that's, for me, deep

down, kind of rhe inear ofwhat we're talking
about. That sense of belonging, ofbeing pan,
of being an important central part of who is
here. [...] At Grinnell it’s part of our tradition
this focus on egalirarianisrn. Absolutely we're
all equal, but we need not make the mistake of
forgetting to celebrate the uniqueness and lift-
ing that up and what that brings to the table.
