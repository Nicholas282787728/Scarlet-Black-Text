Smash Palace

Smash Palace 11982!

This New Zealand iilm carefully and painfully observes the slow
deevoiution ot a marriage into divorce.

Al Shaw, brilliantly played by Bruno Lawrence twho also contributed
to the script), runs an auto salvage company symbolically named Smash
Palace. when his wife. Jacqui tAnna Jemison). begins to ieel the need
for human contact, and proceeds to find it in the arms oi Al’s best triend,
the already heated situation explodes into one of violence and outrage

Jacqui's human need evolves into a taste tor revenge and she vindicT
tively acts accordingly. even denying Al access to his daughter Georgi
tappealingly played by Greer Robsont,

As the situation grows more heated. Al's outrage. triggered by this
denial. turns into selidcstruction. This explicated rage is both powerful
and sobering as the extremes to which a man can be driven are
displayed.

A wile who tried to score one point too many causes the destruction oi
her husband and his world, Though possibly a bit melodramatic at
points. this gripping [ilm leaves the viewer believing he has Just exr
perienced the reality behind the facade.

“Smash Palace” is showing .11. iii pin. Friday in Smith Lounge and at 9
pm. Suiidri~ in South Lounge.

I’m All Right, Jack

'm All Right Jack 11960)
Hailed as the best oi the Belting Brothers comedies. this social and

olitical satire cynically depicts postrwar laborrmanagment relations.

Stanley Windrush. brilliantly played by Peter Sellers. gets planted as a
secret weapon by his patrican uncle in the ranks of labor. Once there.
Windrush unnaturally embraces hard work and upsets the apple cart or
the Strategic balance between management and labor,

He brings about an industry wide strike which climaxes in a televised

confrontation between labor and management. windrush ultimately re-

jects it all and retreats to a nudist camp to shell peapods.

The plot is filled with many surprising twists and subtle touches, but it
never digresses too far trom its subject. In the spirit of good British come
edy. “I‘m All Right Jack" combines spunk and satire.

This fine film is rounded out by an equally [ine cast filled with the
ranking British comedic actors. Among theme are Margaret Ruther-
ford. Dennis Price, lan Carmichael and Richard Attenborough tthe
same one who directed Ghandil. This comedy provides both laughs and
thoughts on a level better than most.

“I'm All Right. Jack" can be seen at s leI. Saturday in South lounge
or 7:30 pm. Sunday in Ant-l.

The Gray Fox

The Grey Fox (198%

Imagine being a reputable (or disreputable) train robber tor years. be
ing placed in San Quenti and then released thirty years later to brave
the new world or the zoth century.

Train robberies are no longer feasible at this age, yet honest labor does
not come easily. as Billy is rejected by those lrom whom he seeks help.
He tries digging clams and then. uritortunately. decides to return to the
life he knows best, one oi crime.

As he painfully discovers. the techniques necessary for modern train
robbery are more sophisticated as are the politics involved. Billy tries
to recapture his past glory only to realize the world moved too far while
he was gone.

Though The Grey Fox is a film dealing ostensibly with train robbery. it
is not an active or violent {ill-n. Rather it is a peaceful journey through a
man‘s liie. which gradually comes cascading down,

Filmed in the Paciﬁc N thwest. the cinematography is sensational
and the image oi the long grey train laying against the furious blue sky is
one that will stay with the Viewer for a long while. This movie quietly
asks to be liked; it does not overstate or overkill. This is an honest film
through and through. and one that should not be missed.

“The Grey Fox” will bc‘shown‘at p.rri. on Friday in ARH and at it)
pm, on Saturday in Ann, »
