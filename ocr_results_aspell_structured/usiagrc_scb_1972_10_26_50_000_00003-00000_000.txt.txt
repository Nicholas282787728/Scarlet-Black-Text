Education Association ’is proposing
that, by 1976, educational costs be
split in thirds, divided at iederal,
state, and local levels

But financial concerns are only
a first step. Student witnesses Pat

ege stressed that much more can
and must be done to upgrade the
quality of the educational format.
”Facts and tigures have no real
value ii you simply stuit them into
your head in order to passan exam,”
exclaimed Ms. Huston.

Dr. Richard Evans from the Eds
ucational Department at Morninge
side outlined an entirely new app»
roach to education, putting a prime
locus on “mastery ofsubject mat-
ter." He decried “Academic Dar-
winism", A system .that is “nil
sorting process with people com-
peting With one another " He pros
posed that schools restructure pro-
grams so that people are given the
opportunity to master the subject
matter being taught, no matter how
long it takes any given individual
to do so. “The point is '9 should
give people the opportunity to learn
everything we have to teach.”

As many “solutions” were kicked

about, the question oiimplementa-
tion was raised. The school systems
themselves have not yet been_able
to cope with the magnitude olneces—
sary changes. “We have been
attempting in the last tour years
to provide as many alternatives as
possible," said Anderson, ”but I’m
not certain we have the time, the
stall, and the resources to reach
every single one (student),”

School hoards and school adminis-
trators inigl‘lt grapple with these
issues. but school boards tend to
“look at dollars", according to
Semler. Fom an administrator's
point at view, Dennis Harkin, Sup»
erintendent ot Woodbury county
Schools, candidly admitted that air
though “i would like to consider
school administrators as change
agents, uniortunately not enough or
Us are." i

This is an area, most witnesses

(National Education Association)
says is suspect,” commented Zie-
sing, “but you are an objective
body.” He asked ISPIRG to "see
it you can’t get a handle on what
has happened.”

Whether ISPIRG or anyone else
can ”ﬁnd the handle" to deal with
“Devastation in Education" is a
moot question. What remained un-
questionable at this public hearing
was the pressing need tor response
and reiorin within the educational
system,

“School has been described as a
mouse race preparing tor a rat
race later on,” said Ziesing. “I
think that it’s partially true...Ithink
it's terrible.

didates gave their views on the at:-

the plank in the Republican platiorm,
that abortion should he a matter of
conscience Representative Husak
voted no on liberalization of the
abortion laws when the issue came
to the House and he told the group
that he would probably vote no ag-
ain ii the issue were to come up
now. Husak, a Catholic, said he
would like to see the issue Come
to the people [or it vote. Alterr
natively, the Democratic incum-
bent said he would ”be thankiul
if the Court would milked decision."

Citing the {3110” in New York at
the abortion-related mortality rate,
Ms. Orr said she iavored a change
[rpm the present Iowa lawwhicli was
passed beiore the turn oi the cane
tury,

Tax reform was an issue stressed
by all three candidates. MS. Orr,
chairman of a 1971 study on State
and local tax systems, gave a Dr»
eakdown of tax revenues, Tile local
property tax, which Mrs Orr tools
to be the most unfair tax, brings
in $747 million a year, sales taxes—
3190 million, and income taxes -
$150 million... Cigarette taxes
($35 million), she noted, bring in
more than corporate taxes ($28
million), Ms, Orr also pointed out
that corporate taxes were based on
the proportion oi income whichaccr
rued irom the corporation's sales
in lowa.

Commenting on the unusual carporr
ate tax structure, Vauderpool said
he knew that one business in the
district, in order to avoid paying
taxes, sent their products out oi
state, and the products were then
brought back into the state (or sale,

“But you have to be careful about
socking it to the corporations just
because it's the popular thing to
do,” he said. Vanderpool noted that
iowa was iust beginning to mouse
trialize and he observed tnat“there
might be a good argument ior keepr
ing it (the corporate tax rate)
as it is."

Husak, a member or a House study
committee on tax reforms, believes
the personal property tax will be
removed, The sales tax, he comme
ented, “will not pass the House
because it seems to hit the low
income people. ithink it's unlair ”
Husak said that a change in the
corporate tax structure had been
stiﬂed in the house by powerful
business interests. All of thecandi-
dates agreed on the desirability oi
liiting the tax ongroceriesandpres-
cription drugs it an adequate substi-
tute could be Iound
