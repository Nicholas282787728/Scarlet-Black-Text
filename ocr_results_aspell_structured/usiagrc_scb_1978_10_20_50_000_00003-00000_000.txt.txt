Harassment provokes diverse response on campus

To the t‘llltDl": I was offended
upon reading the stars editorial on
sexual harassment, The editorial
read. “in the larger society,
problems of sexual harassment
have traditionally been laughed off
by males as inconsequential or
triVial " I find the generalization
offensive: I am a male iii the
“larger society" and do not laugh

I come from an area where
sexual harassment is especially
prevalent, where many a man has
not laughed, but jeopardized his

Death race 2000

To the editor: In our absence. it
would seem that the once-hallowed
halls of Grinncll College have been
putriiied by certain unsavory
elements, who. by means oi a
process that no one seems to un»
derstand Very clearly, have been
elevated to positions oi pseudo-
authority. This, in itself, is nothing
new.

However, it has come to our
attention that the soccalled film
Death Race 2000 was ioisted upon
the student public. Who the hell is
the film chairman? Who the hell
appointed him? Who the hell ape
pointed her? How the hell did he
get that kind oi authority? What,
was he a joke candidate too?

We sure are glad that none of our
money is being paid into the ac-
tlvities iund this semester. A group
of Grinnellians-in-London.

desire to be empathetic Just
because we do not break out the

hearing of an incident that hap»

we are “insensitive to the feelings

There is not much that can be

Defense is needed

To the editor: Wes Kennedy (Open
Space, stirs, Oct. 6) suggess that
the United States should follow the
lead oi West Germany and Japan
and channel our money into
civilian research and development
rather than the military. Did he
stop ior one instant to think about
the reason West Germany and
Japan are able to do this“! They can
spend money on the ciVll‘ian sector
because we defend them. Who does
he think is going to deiend us it we
follow his advice? Or does he think

does he lock his room and his
bicycle? Clay Jenkins.

Sleuths prowl about this weekend

by Michael Greenﬁeld

Although many oi you will be
heading toward other pars oi the
country for the fall break, those
left behind will be able to see two
very good films

The List Of Adrian Messenger
concerns a Wicked man who sets
about to eliminate the eleven heirs
that stand between him and the
great title and great iortune oi the
Marquis of Gleneyre. and the
virtuous man who tracks him
down. The ins and outs of the plot
deiy intelligible recounting, but I
can say it oiieis an . inspired view
oi liic among the British upper
classes.

The program oi murders by
which the charmingvillain hopes
to gain his title is merely a

iramework for director John
Huston's clever work. Although the
film is a genuine detective yarn.
Huston adds a bit of fancy em-
broidery: guest appearances by
Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, Burt
Lancaster, Robert Mitchum and
Frank Sinatra disguised So theV
could be any iivc guys out oi the
Englewood. New Jersey, telephone
book.

The real star of the picture, by
the way, is George c. Scott, the
virtuous pursuer, who again and
again brings the him to life by
sheer iorce oi personality, his
presence makes even the most
preposterous scene real.

Bullitt stars Steve McQueen as a
cool San Francisco cop who isn't
quite sure that he likes his job The

movie is known for its classic
chase scenes, including the high
speed sports car slalom through
the heavy traiiic of the San
Francisco hills and the chase on
foot in the Stygian darkness of the
airport, with landing spotlights,
crushing wheels and the piercing
whines oi the jumbo jet-liners,

During the auto chase scene,
try this- count the number oi
pedestrians on the streets oi San
Francisco. because if I remember
correctly. notone single pedestrian
is visible. not even on the
sidewalk5#a falseness which
detracts from the film.

Oh well, have a nice break, and
see Woody Allen’s interiors it you
have a chance,

Sexual attitudes examined after flashing incidents

it is interesting to observe the
response of the college community
to the CrlSlS'thl‘Cﬂl Situati i
precipitated by the presence oi
flashers and cxhibltionists on
campus. lt behooves iis. l thin ,
stop for a moment and ponder ust
what this (1' Is. and more imp
portanily our response to it, tells u.
about ourselves as a community

Others have observed that oul
response to the current situation is
highly colored by the prevalent
notion that we are ill a small town
irhere these things don’t happen
As a result. the community seems
quite unprepared to deal ivith the
contrary reality which has imp
posed itself upon us.

IT IS CRITICAL and most
difficult at times l'ke‘ this to

remain calm and not react
hysterical , and irrationally A

Is there a .ct' us threat of rape?
Probably not. because ex
hibitionists are not typically
rapists

The goal of a ﬂasher seems most
often to be to evoke tear and create
an upset This is, you will notice
exactly the response we are
providing in tact the whole
campus is getting rather hystel lcal
about this.

ONE SUGGESTION, that a
woman conironted by a flasher
scream loudly, while appropriate
in the case of physical assault, will
provide exactly the response the

just as expedient to quickly
remove onescli as calmly as
possible and get help iroin neigh-
lio ,plione, etc.

Promptly getting help to keep
the ilashcr from escaping is at
least as important as.phoning the
police who will othenvise arrive to
boil the assailant long gone. In
fact, a Ilashcr at Reed College in
'71 was iinally caught only because
two intended victims had the
presence oi mind to restrain him
before they summoned the police,
All earlier attempts to catch him
had Iailed because he always
escaped while help was being
summoned. When restrained he
was naked but quite docile.

IT IS ALSO important to
remember that an exhibitionist is
not simply another criminal. This
is an extremely disturbed peison
who desperately needs help,
Certainly we must remove the
disruptive clement irom the
campus, but we should also try to
cultivate a little human unr
derstanding and, perhaps, sym-
pathy ior someone who is so
disturbed that the only way he can
relate to people sexually is to
appear naked in front of them to
scare them. We are, after all,
supposed to be living in an
enlightened age, aren't we?

have increasingly lallcn back into
nialerdictated sex roles, and are
actively dressing and acting in a
manner uhich will please and
attract men. Whether or not they
recognize the iact, they have
resumed a nonrthreatening subs

Concurrently there has been
little attempt to raise male cons
sciousness above the level of
perceiving women as sex objects
Understandably, many men
cannot thereiore understand why a
woman becomes so upset when
another man responds to this
perceived sexual role even in such
an extreme manner.

i no N01 MEAN to imply that
the current situation IS the fault of
the women, or that the remedy is to
make themselves unattractive or
become nuns. One simply has to be
conscious of what one is doing. if
you are unconsciously projecting a
sexual role you have no control
over its effects

1i you can become conscious oi
the role you are projecting, of the
way you are being perceived, you

feminists" oi yesteryear would
have been just as angered and
upset by the ilaslier as the women
at Griilnell are now, but they would
also realize that they were strong,
competent individuals who could
utilize their own resources to

. confront this problem

.We must all conlront the tact
that the potential for evil exists in
the Grinnell Community as much
as in any other human community.
To realize this fact does not
prescribe the means we choose to
cope with it

WE CAN BE AS children and let
the school establish prescriptive
rules to protect us from ourselves,
or we can be the adults we like to
think we are and assume an active
responSlbility for the resolution of
this or any community problem.
This goes beyond supporting the
SGA or EPC or any other official
body. it means being actively
involved in the community on a
daily basis. helping each other
when in need, and, more im-
portantly, not w ting for someone
else to deal with a problematic
Situation.

This kind of active participation
and responsibility is a fundamental
prerequisite oi a free society. To
pasSlvely wait for the state, the
city, the college or any institution
to settle the problems of one's life
is to relinquish that freedom
categorically.

This decision starts here, now,
with a ilasher. How we cope with
this problem will affect the way we
interact with this, or any, com-

'munity long after the current

problem ha en reéolved.‘
