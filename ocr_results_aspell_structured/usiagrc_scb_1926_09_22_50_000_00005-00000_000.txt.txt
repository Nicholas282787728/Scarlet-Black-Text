Dartmouth Man Vituperates Novel
By Musgrave, “College Fraternities”

Editor's note:

The Scarlet and hlack is printing by
request a review oi Wayne Musgrave's
“College Fraternities." The review is
by a Dartmouth student and appeared
in The New student.

“My duty as a lover ot a good joke,
where ever fuuud, impels me to review
what is, to my mind. one or the best
volumes at unconscious and uninten-
tional humor that his appeared in the
last few years.

Let me begin by saying, that only
the name is inappropriate and in need
or change to complete the cttect. The
title uAin't We Got Fun" would be far
more expressive and entirely in keep-

ing with the spirit and contents or the
book, which is, I'l'o'm cover to cover.
an epic in triumphant complacency
and pleasurable introspection. Truly,
the men responsible tor it have weighe
ed themselves and their organizations
in the balance and found them decide
edly not wanting. In tact, they have
baked in the warm sunlight or mutual
seIK-stvllsfactioli so long that they are
utterly blinded to all things save a
deep and intense conviction of their
I own perrection.

uttering occasional purrs of intense
satisiaction. and by the time the chap

Passing to the various objections
levelled against iraternities, the ducks
or becaines particularly gushing and
amusing. He regards opposition to
them as a phase ct iliiniormed tonatic- ‘
ism, such as was exempliﬁed by the
anti-Masonic movement or the last
century, He then proceeds to answer,
what he considers, the main objec-,
lions, and from this apology we gather ,
that fraternities are practically guilt-
less of all accusations. snobbishness,
he admits. but modestly reters to it as
“the filth or ltings.n We pause to ack—
nowledge the admirable conicssion or
these selfrsyled “kings." That such a
thing as rilth can possibly be connect—
ed with them. Fraternity politics are
“laughed hit" with a tolercnt, "boys
will be boys" air and later the state»
ment that ,in general, the tratcrnities
abstain lrom politics and preach
against them. Dartmouth probably
being one of the few colleges wherein
such generally forbidden customs are
still practiced, on the subject or
drinking, the writer waxes indignant.
Fraternities and iraternity men op~
pose drinking and the only reason that
they are accused or it is because their
organized state makes them an easy
target ior uniust attacks, while the
isolated non-tratcrnity man. in the se-
clusion at his dorm or boarding house,
is at liberty to become intoxicated un-
molested, In connection with
this discussion or drinliiiig. there
