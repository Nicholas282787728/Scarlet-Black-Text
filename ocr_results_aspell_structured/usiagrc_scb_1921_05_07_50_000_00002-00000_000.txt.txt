$5 SPIRIT

Tonight tour classes giltliel in class
parties to can out a tradition that
originated many years ago as one ot
the iirst large social atlalis of the
college. The sophomore class enter»
lains the seniors at a lormai banquet,
and the junior entertain the fresh—
men at a party consisting of Vauder
ville acts and other features.

Every event or this nature brings
each class together in lellowship and
fosters stronger houds or class spirit
Where there are no other ties to form
the spirit of the school, other than the
spirit or the student body as a whole,
some such group spirit such as class
spirit is a healthy thing to keep alive.
1t [ornis some basis for the friendly
rivalries and competitions that are
necessary to keep any hody on its
toes. -

Tile only other basis of spirit is the
house spii' at the dormitories. and
class spirit is a big feature of the
building up or this spiiit. tor it is at
the ' dormitories ulie'i-e the younger-
men come to college and learn how to
conduct themselves as the Gl'ihnell
spirit dictates. and it remains for the
meinbers of the older classes to in-
still ium them the right spirit and
appreciation or the spirit of the Cole
lege.

Many things are lieing done, and all
are praiseworthy, to keep the spirit
or the groups blended together as a
unit. and in the past the Grinnell sys-
tem has been little less than perfect,
it perfection can he judged troni re—
suits, for from all over the state we
hear the praises of the college spirit
sung. ‘

We would like to analyze this spirit

really is,
