Campus remembers
Whitney Hendrickson

nv RACHEL FIELDS

Tessa Checks ’12 first memory ofWhitirey Islendrickson
is a fitting one. Cheek was onc-and-a‘l‘lalf, sitting in a Jolly
Jumper suspended from a door frame. She was crying in terror,
l—lciidrickson was using the door for extra jumping leverage.

“l was sitting there sobbirig.l had no idea what was going
on, and Whitney was jumping around crazily,"Clreelt says.

it seems an appropriate start for their 17tyear friendship.
chtlrlckson's friends agree that certain moments were just
better when she was aroundifunnier, crazier, more alive.

“Everyone says ‘live in the moment, but she was one oftlre
few people 1 met who really embodied that," Cheek says “She
was fully invested in the people she was with, and things were
always more fun when she was there."

l-lendrickson died on March 17 in her hometown ofColor
rado springs, Colo, when a pickup truck collided with the
gas pump she was using to fill up her minivanThe gas pump
exploded, and witnesses were unable to get close enough to save
Hendrickson from the fire. Friend julie Potlair ’12 was with
Hendrickson at the time, but escaped vvithout injury.

There are almost no words to communicate the tragedy
of Hendrickson’s death. in the days after the news was passed
along through phone calls, the online forum GrinnellPlans and
an email from Student Affairs, students were stunned. For
many Grinneuians, it’s almost impossible to understand how
this could happen to someone like Hendrickson—someone so
bright and young and incredibly well-loved.

“She had a way ofmaking you a little more daring because

No Limits Project incites debate through list of demands

The Project, which sent a list of 14 demands for the College to President Osgood, will continue quest to further social justice

BYPAT CALDWELL BL SARAH BLACK

Shortly before students left for spring break, ﬂiers ap-
peared across campus listing grievances and demands by the
No Limits Project, a new organization of students seeking
inrmedrate administrative action on a variety of social jus-
tice, administrative, and institutional initiatives,

The group collected over 200 student signatures on a
petition addressed to President Russell I(. Osgood, Vice
Presidents ofthe College, and the Board othusttsc-s outline
ing 14 requests and a timerrame in which each should be
accomplished.

While most students were busy working on midsems the
week before break, a group ofstuclcnt activists came together
to create the group and push for changes they thought the
administration had been too slow to enact.

“The No Limits Project came out of a lot of different
people having the same eonversatroris about being frustrated
with the College [not] following up on social justice com-
mitments, specifically things that had been promised and
then not followed through on," said Leah Krandel '09, who
was involved with the Project from the beginning.

The group desrrrbcs itself as nonrhicral'chical and has
named no individual leaders, aiming instead to make ch-
cisions eonrmirnally in meetings open to all students. The
group met each night of midsems week, crafting a list of14
demands on a wide range of social justice issues, including
issues of greater divclsity on campus, socially responsible int
vesting, and the school’s environmental commitment, all of
which included specific dates by wlrrch the group eapected
results to be implemented.

The group looked at both the history of activism behind
a topic and its relevance for their socialjustice mission when
creating the list. “There needed to be either a history ofstut
dent activism around them or it needed to be an obvious
pressing issue that could be addressed relatively simply,"said
Brian Perblx '09, who was involved in all the meetings. “In
the final stage ofdemands we were actually looking at con-
crete action that could be taken, and we had to be able to
provide a time frame.”

On March 13, the list of demands was delivered in a lct‘
ter to the President’s office andsent to the Board ofTrustees
and seven other senior members ofthe administration. The
group also placed posters around campus listing their de

mands and encouraging students to become involved and
visit their website, iio/iiiii/rgriiiire/Aaordprcrmiii.

On March 24, Osgood sent a response letter t the group.
acknowledging the issues it addressed and cone shared
between him and the group. However, he expressed his iur
ability to immediately fulfill demands. Osgood cited buds
germ-y constraints due to the current economic downturn,
and institutional limits to his authority.

In an interview, Osgood reiterated the positions in the
response and underscored the boundaries of presidential
power. “There were a bunch of things [in the letter] that
looked like nonrmoney things, but a lot of them involved
[changes in] governance or me overriding committees," he
said.

Osgood maintained that students should feel comfort—
able communicating directly with administrators and ex~
pressed enthusiasm over No Limits social justice agenda. “It
seems to me that's exactly the kind of thingwe will probably
talk about when we move into the next strategic plan, which
is probably a year off,” Osgood said. “[but] you cant do ev-
erything new all at once. some ofthe things we haven't been

With an increase in security presence and
arrival of police in Cleveland Hall, the south
campus dolm’s tight knit community has been
left largely confused.

At around 1:30 am, Monday, March 30,
Director of security Stephen Bliscoe called
the Grinnell Police Department to report a
cigarette size burn in the Cleveland lounge
carpet, according to a Glinnell Police report.
Ofﬁcers Mike Dickenson and David Mcnnur
ga arrived at Cleveland Hall and proceeded to
investigate the lounge. During their investiga-
tion, they found a bag of malijuana.

As part of nightly rounds, on-dury sccur
rity guards had gone into Cleveland lounge

and found the cigarette burn in the carpet,
cigarette butts on tables and the ground, and a
burnt piece ofpaper in the computer lab. After
the security guards notified Briscoc, he called
the fire department

“With the intention ofburniiig in the area
we were concerned about [people] being in
an area where a fire could possibly start," Bris-
too said.

After reaching the dispatcher, the call was
forwarded to the police dep tnicntrs ice it
wasn’t burning at that tinie,"B ' oe id, “the
police department came over to investigate."

When Security and the police officers ex»
arnrned the lounge, they came across a bag of
