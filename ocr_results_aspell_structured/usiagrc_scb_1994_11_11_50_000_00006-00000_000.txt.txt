Medieval cycle plays remedy for “stuffy” religion

By MARK HUANG
Staff Writer

OR those members of the
F Grinnell community who find
religion too stuffy. the
Grinnell College Theatre Department
is proud to present the medieval En~
glish CyclePlays. Written during the
fourteenth through sixteenth centu-
ries, these area series of episodes tllat
were performed by local craft guilds
in lhe towns of Northem England to
celebrate the Feast of CorpusChristi.
The playlets that make up the
cycles cover Biblical myth from the
Creation through Doomsday. While
these were traditionally performed as
acelebration honoring thechurch,they
were not under the direct supervision
of the chutch, and therefore developed
as a mix of the sacred stories of the
Bible with profane humor, spoken as
real people actually spoke. For ex-
ample, The Wakeﬁeld Second Shep-
herds play parodies the Nativity to an
almostblasphemouslevelastwosheep
thieves contemplate lamb stew. The
historical resultwasanexperience that
was as entenairling to the period audi-
encesasit was religious. For over two
hundred yeals. the cycle plays were
developed and performed, and recent
revivals, most notably the one by the
National Theatre of Great Britain in
1977 through 1985 , have rediscovered
the entertalnment provided by the

plays.

The Grinnell College produc-
tion will be performed on the nights
of Thursday, November 17 through
Sunday,NovembetZOat8:00prm. in
Roberts Theatre. While the Grinnell
production does notinclude all of the
plays, according to director Ellen
Mease, it does cover the Creation and

other Old Testament episodes such
as Adatn and Eve, Cain and Abel,
Noah and the Flood and Abraham’s
sacriﬁce of Isaac, as well as New
TestamentNatlvitymatcrialsthrough
thc Massacre of the innocents and the
stage tyrant Herod,

Mease has a personal history with
the cycle plays. She first directed a

 

bllttd.

in the plays a powerful social and
political critique in keeping with our
own youthful and idealistic commit-
ment to peace and social justice."
Later, as a graduate student, Mcasc
was able to try her hand with two
versions of the Cain and Abel play

As an attempt to affect students

class that is focusing on the cycle
plays. Students in the class have
helped substantially with the produc
tion by preparing dramaturgical re-
ports on the plays which the cast and

By AMANDA

HORNBUCKLE
Arts Editor

HEGrinnell Singers will be

performinginaspecial com-

memotativeconcertthisSun-
day in Des Moines. The Singers will
bejoining other area groups, includ
ing the Drake University Concert
Choir, Iowa State Singers, Simpson
Madrigal Singers, Iowa City High
Madrigal Singers and the Chorale
and Children‘s Chorus of the Des

lullr ti ll

Moines Children‘s Chouruscs.

The concert was organized by
Des Moines Children's Choms direc-
tor Eugene Wilson lo commemorate
the 400th anniversary of the death of
Giovanni Palestrina and Orlando
DiLasso, a more secular and world-
traveled contemporary of Palestrina.
While Palestrina is known for his sa-
credwtxksinlatinandltalianDiLasso
produced more dramatic songs in sev-
elal different languages. The concert
will consist entirely of works by
Palestrina and Dilasso. According Io

Lot tt‘tl Lt'u Dctllltlm

Wilson, each choir will perform for
about eight minutes, making the con-
cert around an hour in length. All
vocal music will be performed a
capella, but the audience will also be
able to hear instrumental versions of
the works with an instrumental duct
performing between the choirs.
When Wilson got the idea for a
collaborated concert, he called on the
"fine choirs” of the area to partici-
pate. He said that he felt the need to
celebrate the lives of “these moun»
Iains at the end of the Renaissance."

Grinnell Singers member Dan
Weiss Says, ”I’m reallycxcitcd about
the Palcerlna concert on Sunday.
[Paleslrina] was one of the most im»
porlant composers of church music
during the Renaissance, and author
ofthemostheavcnly music cvercom»
posod,as faras I'm concerned. Itwill
also be neat to heat the other choirs
which will be performing, and to see
how each interprets different pieces
of Palestrina."

The concert will be held in St.
Ambrose Cathedral in Des Moines,
and Weiss says, “I eagerly anticipate
aresonanthall,whichwtllreallypror
vidc the music its proper setting [un-
like Fine Arts 106]. i hope we can
live up to the hlgh standards provided
by the music.”
