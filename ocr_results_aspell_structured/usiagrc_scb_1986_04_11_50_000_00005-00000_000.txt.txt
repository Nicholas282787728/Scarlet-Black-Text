1127 Park St.; and Russian House, 1316
Park St.

Coordinator Thom Barthelmess said
Italian House “isn’t really a language
house i think I'm the only personwho
knows any Italian. It’s a culture house for
people interested in the art, tood,
music. of ltaly."

“I want to get across, it isn’t just an ex-
cuse to geta house; it’s something we real-
ly want to do.” Barthelmess said.

They plan to sponsor events for the came
pus that include “a couple of movies ——
Fellinirtype stuff, one person has a
classical radio show and will devote a cous
ple of shows to Italian classical music: and
a couple of study breaks on modern Italian
art," according to Barthelmess.

Many will be pleased to learn they are
planning a number or coiieehouses or
Italian cuisine, also.

Alternative Lifestyle House, the other
first time project, is made up of people “in-
terested in maintaining some kind of
physical fitness and modifying their diet in

,a healthy way,” according to coordinator
Mark Banik,

“We want to create a support group type
atmosphere because it's really hard to
undertake something like that and stick to

it on your- own,” he said.

Coordinator Hadj Amjadi also pointed
out the house will serve as a co-op conhee
tion tor the whole campus community.

terested in how it was done, Mead, horley

gallons per household is allowed. We can't
sell it: it’s just supposed to be tor personal

Next year’s Russian House coordinators
Pal-n Kellogg and Annette Brown plan to
increase the emphaSls on the use oi the
Russian language in the house, The house
Will have a language assistant, a native
Russian who has been in the U.S. for a
number of years.

“If you know a word in Russian, then you
use it. We're trying to incorporate as much
Russian as possible," Kellogg said

They are planning study sessions. lec-
tures, a few Coffeehouses. and Slavic
breaks that will allow exposuie “to other
aspects of the Russian culture such as its
food and music,” she said,

Kellogg realizes their new location at the
present site oi Brown House will create
some image problems.

“We’re trying to overcome that, We
preler to be called just ‘Russian House,’ "
Kellogg said. “We're not going to carry on
the BrowntHouse tradition.”
