TOWN TOPICS.

Master Russell Smith, Master Lysle
Hartley and Little Jimmy intelt
motored to Dcs iloiucs on Monday last
supposedly to attend a recital given by
John McCormnch. There seems to he
a strong current or opinion in some
circles, howerer, that the little msculs’
real purpose was to escape the supen
vision oi their elders so that they
might commit some such dastardly
crime as going barefoot or smoking
corn sill: cigarettes.

It has been reported that little Miss
Sterner and two oi hei- playmates,
Mrs. Houstoirs little girl and the Kil-
potrich child’. were also bundled oti to
hear John. When questioned in an
attempt to vcriiy this, the boys said
they thought they had seen the other
children, accompanied by their nursc,
enroute to the recital hot at too great
a distance to positively them.

at course, too much credence should
not be given their statement tor, since
coming to kindergarten, the little imns
have gained a reputation for unverr
acity and iintrustu-oi-tliincss. Thi. is

‘ attested to b) the tact that the oldest.
who is but twentysfoui', has been
hranded with the stigma ot house
chairman, court member, senate meme
her, assistant to dean of men, etc. The
other two have like records ot shame,

Ah! Truly the decadence or youth is
upon us. Next We may even hear of
inarhle playing for keeps.

It has been suggested that with the
opening of the outdoor season next
spring that playground supeiwisors be
assigned to various parts or the cam—

-nouuced‘. Several persons have asked:
