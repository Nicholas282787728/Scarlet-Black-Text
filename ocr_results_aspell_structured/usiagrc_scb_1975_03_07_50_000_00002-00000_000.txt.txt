Faculty
receives

report

The raculty Committee received
a report irom the Executive
Council on the power oi the laculty
to recommend a candidate for an
honorary degree and on the status
of the nomination of Fernando
Flores (or a degree. in addition the
faculty discussed the admissions
and application situation at
Grinncll.

The question at the faculty’s
power to vote a recommendation
for an honroary degree centers on
the “ambiguous language" of the
bylaws, President Turner noted.
One section ol the laculty hand
book delegates such power to the
iaculty But the bylaws also state
that this power was delegated to
the Executive Council by the
Trustees. while giving the iaculty
the authority only to reject or
accept the recommendation

Turner reported that the
Executive Council voted that
recommendation oi honorary
degrees by the iaculty was a
reserve power to be used in a
”extraordinary situation." Turner
said he will be taking the issue to
the Board of Trustees for
Clarification. .

At the last faculty meeting, the
name of Fernando Flores was
l'eferred to the Excuctwe Council
by the faculty as a candidate for an
honorary degree. Flores is an
economist currently imprisoned in
Chile for his role in the Allende
Cabinet. Arnold Adelberg,
chairperson oi theiacultyreportecl
that the council unanimously
recommended that ”a degree ror
Flores should not be awarded at
this time.” The council defended
its action by stating that a
representative group for the
degrees was already slated and
that not enough information was
available on Flores:

Ronald Yang, who with Richard
McLaughlin originally submitted
Flores’ name, asked to have the.
recommendation voted upon by the
iaculty. Despite Yang’s admitted
political motivation oi attempting
to make a “worthwhile political
statement, while not violating the
meaning oi an honorary degree,"
the faculty voted down the
proposal, without further
discussion, by a 12:26 vote with 19
abstentions.

The Admissions Committeee
chairman, Nicholas Ryan, than
reported that applications for
admissions at Grinnell are
running about is behind last year.
Ryan noted that this iigure, in
comparison to other A.c.M.

schools. is good.
Ryan asked tor the iaculty

members to begin by next week‘
their annual iolloweup telephone
calls to admitted students.

During the meeting, the faculty
nominated Irene Jones and
Gregory Guroii as members-at-
large for the Executive Council,

Wheelers
and the

dealer

A bicycle club is now being
formed in Grinnell by the owner of
Rick’s Bike Shop, Rick Stein. The
club, which is a sanctioned club of
the League oi American
Wheelmen, is open to anyone who
is interested in biking and would
like to ride often

The club is sponsoring a meeting
teaching how to get your bike
ready for spring, next Sunday at
Rick'sBikeshop atzp.m,The club
also meets on Tuesday evenings
for rides. Right now about 15
people are members oi the club
Stein said meetings are very in-
iormal and anyone is welcome.
The dues are $4.50 for students and
will be used to buy a flatbed trailer
so the bikes can be transported to
another riding area if the club
wants to go. Also included in the
membership is a five per cent
discount on all bikes and parts at
the shop.

Stein said that as the weather
improves and the days get longer
the Tuesday evening rides get
longer, culminating in a 26rlnile
ride The Sunday outings will in,
clude rides of up to 100 miles after
the bikers get in shape.

The former Grinncllian is rather
low-key about his job as owner or
the only bike shop in Poweshiek
County, He explained. “I started a
shop mainly because I got sick oi
doing a lot of ridiculous jobs for
other people." The shop has an
impressive array of bikes and
equipment, but tew oi the junky
accessories that oiten appear in
bike shops.

A chemistry major while at
Grinnell, Stein is now quite content
as a small businesman and
mechanic. He said, “The shop is
actually a lot of fun, I like it.” He
said that business was usually
pretty slow in the winter but “the
rirst Saturday it’s 50 degrees but,
we'll be pretty busy.”

When asked how he got into
being a bike ireak, he said that he
started out with a five-speed Sch-
winn which he loaned to a friend
who promptly ran into a tree,
breaking both his collarbone and
the bike in two. He gradually
moved upin his choice in bikes and
got to be more and more interested
in working on them. Stein now
hopes to takea course in brazing so
he can work on the frames of bikes
as well as the mechanics.

Stein said the club has yet to
elect officers and is actually just a
group oi people who are intersted
in riding as much as an official
group, and that new members
were always Welcome.

Fertile

fields
final

Fertilizer use has been curtailed
beginning this spring, with the
exception oi the playing fields and
new plantings. Herbicides will be
employed according to guidelines
worked out over the past years.

This action was detailed in 21
Feb. 2 letter by President Turner
to SGA and the campus in response
to an SGA request of Feb, 5 ior
curtailment of reduction of fer»
tilizer use.

This new policy was iormulated
after Turner spoke with Mr. Hawn,
physical plant director, and Prof,
Graham. and was reviewed by the
President’s Staff.

In the letter, Turner hoped the
actlon would affirm the college's
concern over the problem in a
reasonable manner He claimed
that occasions occur in the
community when something can be
said by such a simple gesture as
alteration of fertilizer use The
question oi motivation was
discussed by Turner, who said,
”we must ask whether our
motivation is grounded in basic
humanitarian concerns, or is
politically founded, whether our
action compromises in any way
our essential purpose. and whether
we have heard and respected the
voices with the competence to
speak on the matter.”

in the particular case of ier-
tilizer, Turner concluded that such
questions of motivation had been
properly answered, but he had
wanted the opportunity to
”ruminate brieily on the principle
involved.”
