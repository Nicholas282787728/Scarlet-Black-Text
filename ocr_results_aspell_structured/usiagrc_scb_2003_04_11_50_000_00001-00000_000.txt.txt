A bumper crop of seniors heads for prestigious national fellowships after graduation

by Elisa Lenssen
Staff Writer

As was the routine, one day last spring Hai-Dang Phan '03 attended
his poetry workshop and then went to Literary‘lheory. But things were
not exactly as usual: a group of Iraqi posts were on campus with the Iraqi
symposium and spoke in both classes, And as the theory class discussed
Plato’s allegory of the cave in the Republizi the topics ofwriting and truth
and the place of poetry spoke to Phan. “It was a moment," he said, “when
all theory and life in Grinnell had a purpose."

More specifically, the momentinspircd Phan's pro.
posal for the Watson Fellowship. And on March 17,
the moment blossomed into ayear: Phan was awarded
the fellowship, and will spend 12 months fulﬁlling
his proposal, “Transplanted and >lntcd salvo: The
Poetry oFExlle."

in addition to Phan. ﬁve other Grinnell studcnn
have recently received prmtigious awards. Erin Hart

ment, said these numbers repteent a banner year for

Watson

Phan and all Watson participants receive $22,000 and the instruc—
tions to do as they pleasc as long as they are traveling to new areas abroad
and are following a self-designed plan The Thomas 1. Watson Foundac
tron accepts applications from only so liberal am colleges nationwide,
Grinnell ls allowed to submit four applications.

phrn‘s proposal began to crystallize when he asked himself“What
does Plato have to do with today and the world?" The Fact that Plato
kicked poets out of the Republic ch Phan to "start thinking about die
contemporary problem for exile"; today, Phan explained, instead ofbeing
kicked out, individuals and groups are actually kicked into democracies.

Phan explained he was attracted to the Watson because a layer ofcxile
is intrinsically woven into the Fellowship. “Theytvantyoii outofthecountry
by August 15," he said, “And you can’t come back for 12 months . ,, part
oftlre reason I thought about Watson was this performative idea."

and to areas in Australia to meet with Vietnamese refugees, aswell as other
areas in Europe,

Phan first learned hed won the Watson over spring break, on the
morning otMarch I7. The news brought excitement, screams, and the
twirling cfhis mom around the kitdren. But Phan said the day didn’t end
there, because March 17 was also the day that President Bush declared his
ultimatum for war

“My mood sort ofchanged,” than said. “I was
still riding on the Watson, and then the thought we
were going to war. . . [it] lcnr more meaning to what
I'd be doing next year and also rook meaning away
from any kind orindivrdual project."

Whatever twists or turns his project takes, Phan
expects to embrace and be embraced by it. “I don't
know lww this will shape my life," he said, “but I
know it urizshapc my life.”

Carnegie

The Carnegie Endowment for International
Pecos, an eminent think tank in Washington, D.C.,
awards onesyear yunior fellowships with $30,000 Sli-
pends. Two hundrod schools are each allowed to nomi-
nate two applicantsifor only eight to ten spots.
“The fact that two next year are going to be crinncll students," said
cutchins, “is amazing."

Geoffstvenson will spend his fellowship working with a pair otseniot
associates with the endowment on a “Democracy in Rule oftatv' project.

“This particular project is looking at what sort of things the united
states should do to encourage dcmocracy," said Swanson, “In post-war
lraq rcbuildrng, [this means] moving to an actual dcrnoemtic state as up.
posed ro a us. puppet,"

swenson's particular duties will include writing forForcign Polity magi»
zinc. “ill be a research assistant," chnson said, “probably co-writirtg onc
picoe, writing summaries, or eventually authoring my own."

When Swenson first found out he’d received the award, over spring
break, his first reaction was “Wow, I'm saved from law school." Swenson
said he is concerned that law school is moving too far toward corporatized,
“mindrnumbing, boring, papcrrpushlng” law.

stvensorr is pleased with the Carnegie Fellowships alternative focus.
“Working at a think tank is the antithesis ofgoing to work every day," he
said. “I’m just looking forward to being in n vibmnl intellectual environv

GUM forum

No ﬁrm resolution yet over magazine

by Kennedy Leavens
Staff Writer

An open forum organized to address the controversial
humor in the recent issue of The GUM ﬁlled the Forum
North Lounge for over two and a half hours on Tuesday
night. The mocung constituted an impassioned and occa»
rionally angry discussion that centered around white ptivi»
Iege and the cxpcriencn of minorities at Grrnnell, but also
touched on the role on the GUM and ofsatirc in the com-
munity and in racial dialogue, funding for the GUM, and
free speech.

An informal count approximated 250 people in arteri-
dance at the meeting. Equal numbers seemed to have an
rived both in critrcrsm and in support of The GUM.

To open the discussion, GUM staff member Adam
Portilla '03 read a smtcment prepared by the GUeriters
which said that the “audacious" stereotypes printcd on the
mapzine were intended not to oFfend, but rather to mock
the ridiculousness orsuch beliefs and those who hold them.

GUM editor Sarah Aswell ’03 added that Tb: GUM
regretted otfending anyone, but defended the magazine's
right to publish satire, arguing that humor could be a tool
for social good.
The staff, she
said, “were trying
to talk about as—
scntiallst notions
of race" in a way
that was both hut
morons and that
made readers
challenge their
prejudices:

Later, Aswell apologized tot he hun'ﬁrl personal at.
tacks printed in the magazine, However, at no time did
any staifmcmber apologire for printing the articles accused
of racism, much to the visible frustration of many audis
enee members.

students who spoke about being offended by the at»
ticles, many but not all of whom were students of color,
accused stair members ofmcial insensitivity. Some specifi-
cally Claimed that pots of The GUM had undermined the
efforts of groups like the student Organization otIatinosl
Latinas (501.) to fight racial prejudice on campus.

As for the stafs claim that they intended to, in the
words of Lola Garcia '06, “shock people into awareness,"
Garcia told the smif that in their "pursuit of enlighten.
ment," they had made "a group of people who already feel
marginalired” feel more isolated. “Your purposes don't
matter,” she told The GUM,.talking over widespread ap-
plause, “and are not going to change that we feel
marginalized.”

Sevenl studenm argued that TIM GUM should lose the
$18,000 per year in student publications funding that it
receiver for publication cosn and staffsalarics.

Other audience members defended T/ze GUM. calling
satire “an art form" protected by free speech regardless of
its intentions, or testifying that that the jokes interpreted
bysomc as oifrnsive led them to question their own sub»
conscious preiudiees. A few ventured to say that those of.
fended by the humor had “missed the point."

Jeff Bergman ’03 said “squeeeing The G UM out ofexc
istcnce" by denying its funding would be “terrifying” and
would carry the implication of “democratic tyranny"

student scrviccs vice prcsidcnt Tom cmdy, who said
he ind staycd up two hours past his usurl bedtime to listen
to the debate, thanked students for attending as the meet-
ing dispersed around ”:30 pm

Aswell echoed his thanks, urging students to give her
stairsuggrsttons on correcting rho problems that had been
discussed.
