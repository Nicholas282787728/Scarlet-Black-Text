ROFESSOR Ferrel Rose has
been thinking, breathing. and
reading Marie von Ebner~

Eschenbach for the past seven years.
Ebner—Eschenbach is the 19th-cen-
tury Austrian writer she analyzes in
her justrpublished book The Guiser
of Modesty: Marie van Ebner-
Eschenbach’s Female Artists.

The book began life as Rose‘s
graduate dissenation seven years ago
atYale, and she has been working on
it on and off ever since, ultimately
rewriting and expanding thedisserta-
tion extensively for its recent publi-

cation.

Rose first became interested in
EbneraEschenbach, whom she der
scribesasAustria’sanswertoGeorge
Eliot, when she took a year off at
Yale, “At ﬁrsti didn’t want to write
exclusively on her, but focus on a
much moregeneral topic which dealt
with comparing women writers of
her generation (such as Eliot) with
women writers of the turn of the
century.“ However, Rose realized
this topic was too ambitious, and
decided to focus exclusively on
Ebner.

Ebner—Eschcnbach's career can
be divided into two eras, Her earlier
works were mostly dramas, written

in a time when women were consid-
ered too subjective to work in such an
objective genre. “These [early] dra-
mas dealtmore explicitly with politi»
cal issues," said Rose, “...since you
couldn‘t easily criticize the mling
classes without being censored."

Still,Ebner7Eschenbach’S plays
were widely resented, not only for
their social implications, but also for
the piaywright‘s tendency to bite the
hand that fed herinamely, the aris-
tocracy. “There was so much vehe-
mentrejection ofwhat she was doing
thatshe learned totone things down ,"
said Rose, who is an assistant profes—
sor in German.

In the second period of her ca~
reer, Ebner-Echenbach wrote mostly
novellas. Some of Lhem were very
well received and widely admired;
the problem was that in general re-
viewers often relegated women writ-
ers to a separate, inferior category?
the “Harlequin romance category,"
as Rose calls it. "Thus." she says.
“few women writers were taken seri-
ously."

EbncrvEschcnbach had a break-
through at age 50, when she pub-
lished a book of aphorisms, which
are short sayings about life, art, the
relationship between the sexes, and
the like. This success reinforced her
decision to write mostly narrative
works. “More than anything else,
she wanted to become famous,"Rose
said. “in her teens shesaid shewanted
to become the Shakespeare of the
19rh century. She was very, very
ambitious, and she was going to be-
come famous no matter what. She

was just going to keep trying until
something worked.”

As a result, she often revised her
narratives so that they ended happily.
In this way, she was sure not to of-
fend the victims of her satire. “Read-
ers are blinded by their prejudices
when they read a literary work, and
most of Ebner‘s critics were blind to
Lheelcments of her writing that would
be of greater interest it.) readers to»
day," said Rose, and because of
Ebner—Eschenbach’s concession to
this fact, her plays have been written
off as conventional and passive. In
fact, today, Rose said, “she is mostly
knownforaseemingly harmlessstory
about a dog named after a cherry
brandy."

Rose said she wrote the book
mostly for a scholarly audience, “al-
though theintroductioniswrittenwith
an eye to opening her works up to
people who aren't familiar with the
speciﬁc cultural context. it's also of
interest to students interesred in 19th
century literature, Austrian literature,
women writers."

When asked if writing the book
(her first) was an enjoyable experi-
ence, Rose is clearly amused, and
after she has stopped laughing, re-
plies, “I genuinely hated and ago-
nized over the ﬁrst writing stages of
all pans of the process, But then you
get intoacertain rhythm and you start
to enjoy it.“

Rose hepes the process will be»
gin again, in fact: she plans to write
a second book, this one exploring
Ebner—Eschenbach’s inﬂuences on
later women writers
