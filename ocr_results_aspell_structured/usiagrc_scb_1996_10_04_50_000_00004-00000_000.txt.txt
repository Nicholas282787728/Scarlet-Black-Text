' A defined View of drinking on campus

Statistics concerning students’ alcohol consumption are released

By DUSTIN KEY
Staff Writer

Alcohol is fuel for parties. On any weekend night students arrive in
droves at Harris, loggia parties, Gardener parties, and various bars, subse-
quently congregating around various fountains of alcohol either to imbibe
or socrallze with those who are imbibing. The quantity of the alcohol seems
to inﬂuence the magnitude and duration of the pany. Quality seems to play
no role. Although once in a blue moon students get into a frenzy over a keg
of Killians rumored to be somewhere on campus. And in general students
enjoy commiserating over the woes of “The Beast“ and Bud Light.

Drinking is a part of one‘s college career whether one participates or not.
The blaring music ofsay, a party on Cowles loggia at 2 am, can be heard
quite clearly from Main hall. The rest rooms on Saturday and Sunday morn-
ings can be dirtied by someone’s drinking misfortunes the night before.
People who have lived in Norris especially understand that lounge furniture
and phones are damaged forcing the residents of the dorm to pay for the
whole campus. Hangovers, missed classes, saying stupid things. doing stue
pid things, forgetting about stupid things that were said or done are all direct
results of drinking. On the flip side people say they have had really good
times with nights involving alcohol, with or without the various undesirable
effects associated with drinking. In this case the friends of such people
must endure the heroic tales about the night before.

Across the nation drinking is a problem at colleges large and small. Stu-
dents hear stories about parties at giant schools where participants go through
60 kegs of beer. Grinnellians would laugh at the prospect of alcohol in—
duced rioting happening here. Many students here squirm when they hear
_about the strictly enforced alcohol policy on other campuses. Many say that
there is no alcohol problem on this campus and that issue should be left
alone. Further, many believe that the administration turns a blind eye to the
whole alcohol issue as well. But this is not quite the case: last year the Core
Alcohol and Drug Survey was conducted on campus. And with this infor-
mation we can start to get a good idea of what the real situation on campus
is and some idea of what needs to be done.

The 1995/1996 Core Alcohol and Drug Survey has been conducted at
over 1,000 institutions across the nation. 600 students were randomly choe
sen as recipients for the survey, which was received through campus mail.

Of those 373 completed the survey, a high enough percentage replied to
make the ﬁndings Valid. This survey has answered many interesting ones
lions about the aspect of alcohol at Grinnell. And given that the same sur»
vey was conducted across the nation, Grinnell can compare its own situa-
tion with the nation’s.

First the survey gives us an interesting perspective on students' attitudes
toward alcohol in general. 75% of the students who ﬁlled out the survey
believe that alcohol “breaks the ice.” 71% believe that alcohol “enhances
social activity." 24% believe that alcohol “makes it easier to deal with stress”.
56% agree that alcohol “allows people to have more fun." Only 9% say that
alcohol “makes [them] sexier". 51% say it “facilitates sexual opportuni-
ties."

It turns out that Grinnell students drink, on average, the same amount as
other students across the nation. However, the Grinnell perception of alco»
hol policy is vastly divergent from the nation’s attitude. Grinnellians do not
perceive an alcohol prevention program existing at their school.

For instance, 64% of students believe that compared to the other cam-
puses of which they are familiar, the use of alcohol at Grinnell is the same
(Higher 13%, Lower 24%). It is believed that the average number of alco-
holic drinks consumed per student, per week at Grinnell is 3.5 drinks. 82%
believe that Grinnell has alcohol policies and 13% believe that those polie
cies are enforced, while nationally 58% believe their policies are enforced.
Only 18% believe that Grinnell has a drug and alcohol prevention program
(60% don't know, 22% say no). Furthermore, 26% believe that Grinnell is
concerned about the prevention of drug and alcohol use, while nationally
this ﬁgure is 72%.

The administration is concerned about drinking at Grinnell, but doesn’t
seem to be ﬁxated so much on prevention as awareness and responsibility.
What really concerns Student Affairs is the incidence of binge drinking. As
deﬁned by The Harvard School of Public Health, binging is having ﬁve drinks
at one sitting within a two week period (four for women). The core survey
asked students to think back over the last two weeks and repon the number
of times they had had ﬁve or more drinks at a sitting. 64% said none (18%
said once, 8% twice). Students seem to have a different idea ofwhat binging
is however. When asked simply if they had binged(no deﬁnition given)over
the last two weeks 36% replied yes. Nationally this figure is 39%.

There are in fact alcohol»related programs here at Grinnell, but focus com-
pletely on awareness as opposed to prevention. Here. the program is passive
and built into the functions of student staff. Early in the ﬁrst semester, stu—
dent advisors and residence hall coordinators talk to the ﬁrst years about
alcohol. Informational literature is very pervasive throughout the residence
hall bulletin boards. Also this year the Student Health committee has been
reorganized as the Student Committee on Health and Wellness and will be
conducting awareness building activities later in the year.

Finally it is important to realize that even though“ the study is valid it
doesn't necessarily represent the truth. Given that the survey was a self
assessment. biases are certainly coming into the mix. Regardless, the study
gives the students and the administration an idea of the situation and in-
creases the awareness level. The administration understands that ultimately
the whole decision of drinking is each student‘s own and feels that the best
way to insure a safe, healthy campus is to make sure that students are aware.

Live from California’s fertile
Central Valley, this Sacramento
band has attracted the kind of ec-
static response most newcomers
only dream of and seasoned veter-
ans justifiably envy. Based almost
entirely on the strength oftheir live
performances and on word of
mouth, CAKE has built up a sizable
following that is fast billowing out

Guest Film Reviewers

This week‘s movie line up is a
stellar star studded extravaganza
brought to us by this year’s Film
Chair Matt Saiia. Matt brings to—
gether some of Nicolas Cage’s
mostedeveloped roles. You may
know him from such classics as
Valley Girl and PeggySue GaIMar-
ried. For our new and improved
movie reviews, we have developed
a highly scientiﬁc formula for rank-
ing: our personal opinions. But
without further ado here is our ﬁrst.

and least prepared, attempt at movie
reviews:

Raising Arizona (*"”)

This ‘80’s masterpeice is a story
about an ex-convict (Nicolas Cage)
who is married to a policewoman
(Holly Hunter). They can’t have a
child ofthier own, so they steal one
from a very wealthy family who has
plenty. This film is extremely
funny and quirky. Somewhere in
the ﬁlm a really scary guy on amo—
torcycle appears and tries to steal
the baby too. Lots of fun chase
scenes and off»key humor abound.
We definitely recommend this ﬁlm
for your consumption.

Leaving Las Vegas (”W“)

Leaving La: Vegas is an incred-
ible film starring Nicholas Cage
and Elizabeth Shue. This is the
movie that won Cage his ﬁrst Os-
car and Elizabeth Shue an Oscar
nomination. We were riveted by its
accurate and daring depiction of
two lost souls who ﬁnd comfort in
each other and yet still fail to find
happiness in life. Nicolas Cage
plays an alcoholic who consciously
decides to drink himself to death.
Elizabeth Shue plays an intelligent
woman tangled in a life of prostie
tution. Immediately they find
themselves in a coedcpendent rela»
tionship which ends in selfdestrucv

 

a sort of reckless eastward expan-
sion.

With the release of their new CD.
MOTORCADE OF GENEROS-
ITY. there is emerging a sound of
non-negotiable high quality (not
necessarily high ﬁdelity); ajugger—
naut of true musical enjoyment. vir-
tually unfettered by the uptight and
unyieldingly narrow confines of

tion.

At one point in the ﬁlm they try
to escape to a hotel in the desert,
but Cage cannot escape his alco-
holism. Shue’s character cannot
break out of the honors of prosti-
tution and the violence that sur-
rounds her. With an extraordinary
script and direction, this ﬁlm rises
above the typical character devel-
opment ﬁlm. The story-line ex-
plores the deepest dramatic emo-
tions and controls the audience
through the whole movie. There
is no way we could ever express
how intense this movie is. Al-
though it may not be the best movie
to take your mother to (as Jon did),
it is one oflast year‘s best. An in-
credible, thought-provoking
drama.

The Rock (77???

This weekend SGA hosts the
American film The Rack. Unfor-
tunately neither ofus have seen this
fun filled frolicking/story of
supspence and deceit, for four main
reasons:

1: We just got this job two days
ago;

2. The forum desk didn’t have
the movie;

3. John had to get his hair cut;

4. Jon is going through detox.

But, go see this movie anyway.
because it stars Nicolas Cage and
Sean Connery and it is about
Alcatraz. Two great tastes, taste
great together.

Ranking Key:

(“V”) : Better than CATS,
you‘ll wanna see it again and
again.

0*“) : Better than Ezra.

0") Good quality fun.

(**) : You could probably
spend your time more wisely at a
Harris Party.

(*) = As good as both of our
GPA‘S combined.

(7 7) = It was lost and we
could not find it.
