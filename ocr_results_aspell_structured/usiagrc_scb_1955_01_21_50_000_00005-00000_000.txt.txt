Knox at Darby

The Scarlet and Black wrest
lers are up against a powerful
Knox squad next Saturday after-
noon at Darby in what should
prove to be a very evenly matchr
ed. contest. The following Mon-
day, also at home, the home
grapplers encounter South Dar
kota State college.

Knox was third behind the
Pioneers in last year's confer
ence meet. They lost a dual
to the locals 14-13 last seuon.

Augies Tip Knox

Knox knocked off Coe college
earlier this season by a 27.3

,count. in two matches against
Augustana, which Grinnell tape
ped by one point, the Siwashers
have split, winning the first by
an 13.1»; score and dropping the
other by a one point margin.

Knox's lineup‘ will include
some very strong entries. Jim
James will be John Bohannon’s
opponent at 123-le. Andy Logo-
thetis, returning to the local
lineup after being sidelined by
a cracked rib for two weeks, will
tangle with lao.lber. Dick Gap-
pen.

Other probable pairings are
137 lbs, Dick Thomas or Ned
Budlong versus Dan Kimble; 147
lbs, Marty Hall versus Larry
Kipperman; 157, Lee Savage and
George Blackburn; 167, Wills
Davidson and Homer Johnson;
177, captain Tom Marshall and
Art Sindcn; heavyweight, DonI

The indoor track season opens
officially for Grinnell on Feb.
lst when a contingent of Pioneer
track hopefuls will begin to get
in shape for the first duel meetl‘
with Iowa state Teachers col—

At this early stage the out.
look is fairly bright for the
cindermen Returning from last
year’s squad which was second
' the ‘
distance men George Drake,
Frank Hays, Blll Largent, andl
Jim Kingland. These four should‘
make an excellent nucleus for
the indoor relay meets, along
wtih distance man Dave Qutub,
and sprinters Nick Ryan and

aurice Carver.

Carver and Chuck Westrup in
the hurdles, Tom Boe and Dick
' alkcr in the shot, and pole

by Hull Potltoven

Pioneer swimers have a busy
two weeks ahead of them and it
isn’t all due to the final exams
coining up next week. on suce
cessivc Saturdays they will en-
gage two Midwest conference
foes in dual meets, the out-
comes of which should give a
fair indication of the Pioneers’
chances of retaining the loop
crown they won last year. ,

Tomorrow Cornell college var»
sity and freshmen teams will
provide the opposition in an-
other home meet for coach lrv
Simone's tankers, Simone said

 

that Cornell is in the building
process right now and their
varsity shouldn't pose too stiff a
test for his charges The fresh
meet should be just about l‘e<
versed since the Rams have the
strongest group of yearlings n
[his area.
Knox Seeks Revenge

On January 29 Knox college
will come to Grinnell in an at»
tempt to gain 2| little revenge
for last year’s conference meet
in which the Pioneers nosed
them out by three points in the
last relay. Revenge will not be
a motive wholly reserved to

 

Crawls, Musser Among Top Scllrérs _

w‘th Cornell firmly’ entrench-
ed in first place, the focus in the
Midwest conference basketball
championship is on the scramble
for first division notches. The
current standings have Lowe
rence, Carleton, Monmouth, Coe,
and St. Olaf in the thick of the
fight. ‘ .

The latest tearn' otfensive and
defensive rankings for confer
ence games shows Grinnell seer
ond and last respectively. Only

the Smash. since Grlnnell will
be out to avenge one of their
two dual setbacks of last year.
Already the Pioneers have even-

ed the slate with the University
of Nebraska by a 42-42 draw
in their opener.

Knox, which appears to be the
strongest threat to Grinnell
supremacy, will rely on the div-
ing and sprinting of captain Ted
Fleming plus good balance in
the other events. Fleming has
lost to only one conference diver
in his four year career and that
was former Grinnell ace Jim
Brown three years ago.

Simone will go along with the
same outfit which has kept the
Pioneers undefeated in three
dual meets this season. The only
cloud on the scene is that these
two meets will be the last for
one of Gtinnell's greatest swimr
mers, wally Bragdon. In the past
three years Bragdon has accum-
ulated both the zoo-yd. back-
stroke and ”Boyd individual

varsity iccords as well as being
a member of the 440-yd free-
style relay squad which lowered
the Midwest conference mark
last year.

Drown st, Olaf

Last week the Pioneers knock~
ed off loop rival st. 0135 by a
tune of 52—40. The afternoon’s
activities saw two new records
posted by the Grinnellians, one
by junior star Joel Stubbs, who
lowered an 18 year old so-yd.
freestyle record from so flat to'
29.8. The other was by the 440
crew of Stubbs, Bragdon, Howie
Runyon and Tom Hejna whose
time of 3246.0 was eight tenths
of a second better than their
own mark set in the conference
meet last year.
