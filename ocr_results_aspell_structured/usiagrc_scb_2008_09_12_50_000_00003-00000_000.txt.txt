Last year Grinnell College hired its

in lieu ofan Arabic or Middle Eastern Studs
ics department.

Before now, students who wished to learn
Arabic had to do so through the Alternate
Language study option (ALSO) program,
which is a largely self-taught eoutse suppler

 

rnented by occasional
sessions with a fluent
teacher. With the addir
tion of an ofﬁcial Ara»
bic class, there are 55
spots available in Arabic
classes.

“The ALSO pro
grain is do

ing proﬁcient
knowledge or
Arabic,” said
SGA Vice
President of
A c a d e m i c
Affairs Julie Hoye '09.

"Now, people wlro
want to study Arabic can
actually learn because
there‘s someone to teach
them,"

A large amount of
the initiative to offer Arr
able courses came from

“students realize they need to know that
part of the world in order to be an effective
citizen," she said,

Youssef said she also envisions the Arabic
classes as an introduction to Middle East-
ern culture. “My goal is not only [to teach]
the language," Yousset’ said. “But it is also
to equip them with tools to learn about the
complexities of the region."

believes that the language is vital to under—

“Arabic is sort of inseparable from the
culture of the Middle East," Tetenbaum
said. “Cultural habits make their way into
the language."

Paula Smithi vice president of Academic
Affairs and Dean ofthe College, used part of
a thrccsyear grant from the Andrew w. Mel-
lon Foundation to start the Arabic program.

According to Smith, a new interdisciplinr
ary faculty member, who will focus on His
roty and Relrgron in the Middle East, Will be
lured for the 2009 school year.

Students, alums launch GrinnellWiki

thnrtteannac AND SUNANDAVAIDHEESH

“Ifit's on wrupcdia, then it must be true,"gocs the say-
ing. Now Grinnellians have their own online depository
or facts and source of questionable *truths’ wrrh the ofﬁcial
launch of www.crirrncllr

Grinnell Many of the pages are in the “stub" form and need

to be filled out.
Due to the openness of the wikr forlnatilnformatiou
can be created and edrtetl freely, without prior approvalgthc
wrki administrators will

 

WikLCOm.

After a summer of
working out style and
developing content, the
GrinuellWiki is onlinc
and open to the public.
While anyone with an
internet connection can
view the website, only
those with Grinnell e,
mail addresses can create
or edit content.Tlie web
site, which was created
by students and alums,
provrdes a novel source
for alumni-student inter-

 

cdit articles rot appropri-
ateness to avoid slander,
according to rounding
rnember- Emily srlevcr ’09.
Users who do post slander
will be subject to a bane
rung. “Anyone who posts
inappropriate posts or
vandalizes articles will be
permanently banned from
the sire," Stievci said.

The idea for the wlki
began last spring during a
conversation between Ema
ily Sticvet '09 and Harry
Krcjsa '10. Krcjsa was al-

 

 

action.

According to Ethan Struby '10, who rs heavily involved
in the website, the content should cover material that is
both factual and subjective Rather than only having ency-
elopcdiarstyle entries, “The GrinncllWiki needs the stories
and personal experiences of Grinnellians," struby saidThe
GrinnellWiki currently hosts 604 pages, with topics ranging
rrom academic departments to memories of big concerts at

ready working on a wild
for SGA, and sticver said the VoiccBox's goal was to brrild
a database tor student organizations so that they could leave
the results ror futule students, “I saw that students were don
ing all sorts or neat projects, but after rhcy finished, they left
no record," she said.

When they went to purchase the URL, they round out
that Mitchell Erickson ’72 and rrvo triends had already be~

gun tr GrimaellWiki exclusrvely tor the Grinnell class or’72,
For the alumni, the wlki was a place to remember “signiﬁcant
events," Erickson said.

The projects merged and the site was rcrrnagined to inn
clude alumni and strident perspectives.

Erickson said he also hopes for it to be an errective way
or keeping track of alumni, as wcll as their achievements.
The Office of Alumni Relations has been key in spreading
the word of the new site,
particularly so that other
past classes can have their
experiences shared with the
crinnell community.

The wilciheads hope that
the GrinnelJVViki will be-
come a staple of Grinnell
lite. “In the long run, I just
hope it wrll continue to CX*
ist,” said Struby. “I want to
be able to still 'now what's
going on in SGA four or live years after t graduate,"

And a quick glance at some or the information these
prospies and anyone else can glean rrom the wiki: Grinnell
dining options wrth an extensive list orthe names and phone
numbers ofvarious eateries in Grinnell and the surrounding
area; books by Grinnellians, including Why Do Pirates Love
Parrots? by David Fcldman (‘71); and random facts about all
things Grinnell, like the actual name for the cycling club:
Mating Sings,

”In the long run, l jut! hope
it will tom/nae to eXIst, /
want to be able to still know
what’s going on in 56A ,.
after I graduate ”
