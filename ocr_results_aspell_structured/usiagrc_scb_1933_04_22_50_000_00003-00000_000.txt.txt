Plenty of interest is being shown
in the spring basketball session that
is being hcld now under the dimer
tion of Coach John c. Truesdale. The
practices have been held this week
and will continue for another, with
the possibility of a. game being held

to tel‘minaLe the season.

aggressive game at the for d pas

In addition to Frye there are five
other lettermen who will be eligible
for the team. in case they return to
school. Captain Gaston Santi, and
Les Menus. guards, Dick Mason and
Bill Farzybok, forwards, and Dick
Phelps, center, are the men who will
probably be given first chances at
the varsity berths for next year. In
addi on to these several capable
players from this
team threaten to replace some of the
lettermen. Even though it is entirely
too early to predict in an authentic
manner, it at least seems that mar
terinl will not keep the team from the
winning columns next season.

With some of the reports that are
coming from Des Moines regarding
the annual Drake relays, we are led

of the best ever presented. Among
the features to be present at the
event, Ralph Metcalfe, negro speed-
ster from Marquette university. will
participate in six events, being 2117
tercd in the loo-yard dash and two
relay events, in addition to the pre—
liminaries. He is co-hclder of the‘
world record in the century, and is
generally considered one of the host
sprinters in the country. Now that

Thirty—six universities and col-
leges were in the entry list early
this week and several more are ex-
pected today, so that with the addi-
tion of high schools to the list sev-
eral hundred athletes .wiu probably
compete at Des Monies next week.
Teams have been entered from all
ports of the country, with teams
from Butfalo, N. Y. and Greenfield,
Miss, being the extremes.

Coach Lester Duke has not defin-
itely decided his squad for the event,
but it is probable that several relay
teams and possibly some of the indi—
vidual events will be considered. One
of the biggest hopes for points for
the pioneers lies with the four-mile
relay team which is competing in the
Kansas relays at Lawrence, today.
Pllbrow, Pfeiffer, Gordon and Men»

lished times in the mile run.

TwenIy-Six Men Workout
for Coach Truesdale

Twenty—six men have reported for
the two-weeks spring basketball
practice, which has been held this
week at the men’s gymnasium, un—
der the direction of coach John c.
Truesdale.

Four lettermen are working out,
including. Captain Gaston Santi,
Marion Frye, Leslie Manna and Dick
Phelps. In addition to these, two let—
termen, Dick Mason and Bill Farzy—
hok. are varsity track men and will
not participate in the spring cage
session.

Truesdale has been working his men
on fundamentals so far. and will
probably call for several scrimmage
practices later next week. There is a
possibility that the season will be
wound up with a game, either be-
tween members of the squad, or
against graduating members of this
year's team.

In addition to the lettermen, there
are many capable men working out,

3 Relay Sprints

’Ralph Metcalfe May Break

1 Records in Annual

Drake Carnival

DES MOINES, Ia. (SpeclaII—Vvitll
Ralph Metcalfe of Marquette univer-
,sity definitely entered in the 1933
Drake relays carnival the sprint
events take on more color because of
his remarkable performances, not
only this season, but last summer at
the Olympic games as well.

Mctcalfe is just now at the half-
way mark of his varsity running
career and is Marquettc’s current
wearer cf the toga of “World's Fast-
est Human" with his thoughts drivV
ing toward greater and faster things
on the nation's cinder tracks.

Expected to Improve

The Negro sprint star has drunk
deep from the fountain of success in
the best track circles, but close ob-
servers have indicated that “you
ain't sccn nothin- yet”. His starts
during the current indoor season
have shown a vast improvement and
indicate that anything may be ex-
pected of him in the coming outdoor
campaign.

For one thing. Metcalfe has equall-
ed or mastered with one exception,
every known sprint record from 40
to 220 yards, though his marks are
not yet official. Thus far he has not
met the now official record of Frank
Wykot'f’s 9.4 seconds for the 100-
yard dash although. last year, he
reeled off the century in 9.5 seconds
three separate times and this was
then the official record.

National A.A.U. Champ

At a moment. Mctcalfe as the
world's fastest human. is National A.
A. U. champion at so meters. 100
and 200 meters, and National Col-
legiate title holder at 100 yards and
220 yards.

Despite his remarkable ability,
Metcolfe will find plenty of cpposb
tion in the century at the Drake
carnival, Peyton Glass of Oklahoma
A. c M.. winner of the event two
years ago is running the hundred un-
der the time he won it in and is con—
sidered a strong contender. Whitley
Cox of Oklahoma university has de-
feated the fleet Glass this season
and a bitter dual is expected between
these two boys. Heye Lambertus of
Nebraska, Frank smith of Drakei
Ivan Ruqua, and Clarence Crouch of
Indiana and Willis Ward of Michigan
are other sprinters considered as
possible victors in the century.
