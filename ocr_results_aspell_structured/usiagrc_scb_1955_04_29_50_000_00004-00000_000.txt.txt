Baghdad- Iraq

Your letter of March 17th was just received and we are
always glad to hear from Gl'innell. We have 1leeii receiving
the S&B and tile Grinnell Herold—Register; so we are onll
about two months behind on the news! It takes surface
mail about that long to reach us. We also have had many
interesting letters from students and faculty and would
like to use this method to acknowledge them.

Today is Palm Sunday, and
seemingly quite out of place
in this Moslem community in
spite of the fact lhat Baghdad
with its (late palms is very
much like the Holy Land. The
students at the colleges are
“enjoying" a long weekend
which began on Thursday
noon, Friday of course is the
Mosleln day at rest, Saturday
was Iraq's Independence Day,
Monday is the anniversary of
the King's accession to the
throne and next Wednesday
is a new national holiday eel-
ebrating the ending of the
lruq-nrilish Treaty signed or-
iginauy in 1930. in between
holidays classes are supposed
to be held! Incidentally, these
"schedule ” events are not
the only interruptions. (I'm
sure the Personnel Board
would be able to slip in a
Thanksgiving holiday some-
where.)

During the weeks preceding
the signing of the Turkish—iraq
pact there were so many dem-
onstrations and feelings ran so
high that all classes in three of
the colleges were suspended
during the time that Praidem
Bayar of Turkey was visiting
Baghdad. These “demonstrations"
are largely inspired by outsiders
and oi course the colleges and
students suffer. iroq with her
neighbor Iran ii maintaining
quite a “police state" aimed at
communism. Halsy is the only
American, or even non-Arab stu<
dent in the science college and
01 course gets the student view-
point which I miss. My Work at the
college is strictly “lecturing,"
and I have had no responsibil‘
ity for laboratories, committee
work, etc, In this respect 1 have
had quite a vacation, tho I must
admit that I have missed the
meetings of the social (:00:di
ating committee. We Fulbrighters
are somewhat stepchildren o!
the State Department and are
clSsed under U.S.I.S. We live
next to the American Embassy
and are in the middle of a large
American - English community,
with the social life centered in

, the Alwiyah Club where more
are two swimming pools, mo—
vies, etc. One of the interesting
aspects of living so close to the
Embassy has been to see the
inside workings of a mision 0d
this size. Our appreciation oz

the State Department has gone
up.

My teaching schedule is
such that there is ample time
lor sightseeing. Baghdad itsell
has many interesting inu-
seums, etc, but probably the
mosques, bazaars, and shops
have received a dispropor-
tionate share at our time. The
imily has enjoyed lrips lo-
gether to nubylon, th- of the

Chhldees, and Nineveh where
active urclleological work is
still going on. Mrs. Gale and
I made an interesting trip by
bus to Tehran during the
spring recess. n was a thirty
hour lrip over the mountains
and our only sight of snow all
winter. Tehran is n most in»
teresting place, much more
Western than Baghdad.

We like Baghdad because it
is predominately Moslem still
in dress. culture, religion. and
quite untouched in many ways
and places by the West.

We have been pi‘lviledged
lb visit native villages, and local
Silelks on their desert oasis, and
Bedouins in the desert tendr
ing their flocks of broad-tailed
sheep. Many scenes such as the
pumping oi irrigation water,
grinding of grain, weaving, elc.,
could well be lifted righl out 01
Bible times.

We have missed Gi'innell, and

have been tremendously inter-
ested in all your activities. We
rejoice in some, such as the
Lake Project; in others, like the
abandonment of the nominating
convention for so. president,
there is an apathy which is not
typical of Grinnell. To the Sen-
iors, we wish you well. Yours
will be the first commencement
that l have missed since June,
1929. As Alumni, come back to
see us, or we will come to see
you. By the time we return to
Grinnell in August we will have
seen Grinnell graduates whom
we know well all the way from
North Iraq to Damascus, Beruil,
London and probably in many
other unexpected places. We
find that Grinnell abroad has
an enviable reputation, and we
are glad lo be part of it.

Sincerely,
Gram o. Gale
