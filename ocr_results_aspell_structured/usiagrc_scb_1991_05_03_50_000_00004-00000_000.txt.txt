Committee aims to close with a clean slate

College faces problem of $16,000 a year in end—of—year cleaning fines

By Sarah Purcell

The new Closing Committee,
composed of student. B and G, and
administration representatives, has
organizedaconcenrdefforttomake
the end of the year a cleaner and
more pleasant time for everyone at
Grinnell this year. There have been
a variety of procedural problems,
with the closing of the dorms and
college owned houses in past the
past several years, which the com-
mittee hopes to avert this year.

This year all students will have
to vacate the dorms and houses by
6 pm. on Monday, May 20. A
letter from the committee, which
will go out to all students at the
beginning of next week, says that
“atdtis time the halls will belocked
and Resident Advisers will check
roomsand common areas for clean
liness and damage."

Last year. few students fully
complied with the Student Handy
book requirement that “rooms
should be left locked, orderly and
clean.” Jennifer Krohn, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs for Hous-
ing, said that last year only “Haines
andlames, under the supervision of
Dave Clark,” were left at all clean.

She said the damage and disar»
ray were outof control. “Youmight
as well be going through a town
which had just been struck by a

tornado," she remarked. Almost
every student was assessed some
type of fine for cleaning services at
the end of last year, and the total
amount of fines exceeded $16,000.
Asaresultof the damage, theclosing
committee was appointed to find a
solution.

The disorder has caused tremen-
dous problems for the college, be»
cause the dorms have to be ready
approximately one week aflercom-
mencement to house alumni for the
annual reunion. Krohn said that the
amount of work during that week is
“very degrading and demeaning to
the custodial staff" which “serves
students“ throughout the school
year. President Drake said that the
terrible condition in which the
dorms are left “leaves the Stalfwith
an almost superhuman task."

The staff has been left with prob
lems much bigger than a bit ofdirt

all types of f urninire, unrloft beds.

huge number of items abandoned
by students. Des Olinger, Assistant
Director of Physical Plant Opera-
tions, commented that ”studean

landﬁll." The physical plant staff
“just backs a big dump truck up” to
haul everything out because there
is insufficient time to son through
everything. Last year it took two
days with two large trucks to haul
away everything which was left
behind, creating a lot of unneces-
sary garbage. The clothing which
has left behind in the past has been
donated to MICA or the Bethel
Mission in Des Moincs.

President Drake said he thought
a lot of things were left behind in
the past because the “college hasn ’t
provided enough places for their
disposal."Thisycar the collegewill
try to “provide more receptacles.”
Studentswill be told explicitlywhat

condition their rooms must be left
in, and they will be held account-
able if the conditions are not met.
There will be a variety of signs
and RA sponsored study breaks to
reinforce the masage of the Clos-
ing Committee’s letter. Jennifer
Krohn said that there will be "trash
pickrups twice a day,” so students
will be better able to clean up.
There will be a daily pick-up
from designated spots in the loggia
of large items such as furniture that
will be donated to M'ICA and Sec»
ond Mlle in Grinnell. Clothing
donation bins will be placed all
over campus as well and emptied
daily. Extra brooms,dustpans,and
trash bags will be available to all

students in dorms or houses.

Krohn stressed that students
“shouldn’t store their stuff in the
halls" due to the fire-hazard. Stu-
dents should also avoid packing
their personal belongings in trash
bagsbecause"anythingintrashbags
will be hauled away."

Jennifer Krohn said that "stu~
dents have been very inﬂuential in
putting this package of reforms to-
gelher," and she hopes that every-
one will make an effort to leave the
dorms in better condition before
they move out. The committee
hopes that with a modicum offore-
thought and preparation, the cam»
pus can work together to avoid the
annual mess.

 

Campus group tutors, campaigns
politically for Native Americans

By Denice Skelly

The campus Native American
Interest Group (NAIG) is well
known for its Altemauve Break at
the Mesquakie settlement in Tama.
Iowa. However, a lesser known
program has been mnning at the
settlementfor several years: NAIG
tutors children of all ages at the
seniement, gathering every Thurse
day night around 6:00 to travel to
Tama.

Junior Jessica Roff, who helps
with the organization of the tutor-
ingprograrn,extolledtheprogmm's
virtues.

“Itisanamazing thing for me
and a great experience. I have a
great time tutoring, and it is some-
thing I need. It makes me feel
good," said Roff.

Certainly, appreciation of the
program is evident in the faces of
the children and the parents at the

Mesquakie settlement who attend
the sessions.

The tutoring program's long-
range goals, beyond helping stu
dents' improve in their studies, in-

lum.rheorganizatlon views politi-
cal activities and education as its
main goals. In orderlo educate the
college ‘campus about Native
Americans, NAIG sponsors a vari»
ety of programs including films,
speakers and Altcmative Winter
Breaks for students and professors
at the Mesquakie settlement.

NAIG hopes to organizeanolher
Alternative Break in 1992 for all of
those who missed the exciting
chanceto learn aboutthe Mesquakie
tribe and the opportunity to apprer
ciate a different heritagewhich was
offered atthelaStAltemalive Break.

The group recently coordi-
nated the visit by the Mesquakie
Settlement Bear singing group to
Grinnell for Skip Day. NAlG also
recently participated in a peace
demonstration in Wisconsin on the
weekend of Apri120th aspart of the
protest against recent violations of
the Chippewa tribe's long standing
treaty with the slate of Wisconsin
regarding spear rishing quotas or
walleye.

The conﬂict between the
Chippewaand local white residents
arises from the allegation by some
that the spear ﬁshing threatens the
fish stock in an area that depends
heavily on tourist revenue from
anglers, who ﬂock to the area every
summer. Then'sing tide ofviolence
culminated in the burning of a Na-
Live American flag by local un-
glers.

Around 250 wimesses from
the midwestregion gathered to pro-
test the violence and show support
for the Native Americans and the
treaty. Among the protesters were
the Stop Treaty Abuse and Protect
America’s Rights and Resources
organizationsNAlG plans tocone
tinue support for the annual protest
until violence and harrassement of
the Chippewa end.

After a successful year in 1990-
91, NAIG’s goals for 1991792
school year focus on educating
Grinnell College about Native
Americans, tutoring sessions at the
