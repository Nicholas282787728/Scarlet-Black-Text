Sophomore Sprint

(Special to The Scarlet mid Blndi)

OMAHAiAgain exhibiting 3 var-
ied and potent offense, Creighton
university gridners are living up to
optimistic predictions.

One backﬁeld combination that
worked smoothly had Captain Bill
Worthing at quarter; Conrad Collin
and Jack Carland at halves, and Bud
Rose at fullback, Collin ran 35 yards
hehind perfect interference for the
ﬁrst score, and Rose dodged tacklers
for 45 yards to make the other
touchdown.

One dark cloud hung over the
Blnejay camp. Leo “Baldy" Bolder-
son. 210 pound allrstate high school
tackle and star linesman of last
year's undefeated freshman eleven.
received news that he may have to
leave school because of the illness
of his father. The Manhattan heavy-
weight has practically won a tackle
berth on the ﬁrst varsity eleven, and
his loss- would be a severe blow to
the Bliiejay line.
