GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Studenl's Favor U. S. Neu+rali+y

AUSTIN, Texas, May 117A:
Europe's war spreads into Hol-
land and Belgium. observers are
pointing to inceasing possibilities
of the United States' being '
volved. In the opinion of Ame .
can college students, many of
whom are of fighting age, what
are the conditions under which
the United states should join the
Allies against Germany?

Interviewers in scores of cum»
puses have asked that question in
a Student Surveys poll. The re»
sults show definitely that the
American coliegian has not
changed his mind. and is still
much‘ opposed to rushing into
the conflict.

A good majority of two-to»one
may be included in two camps:
Those who believe we should not
join at all, and those who would
have us fight only in case the
United States is actually threat-
ened with an invasion.

The largest group of students,
one-third of the entire enrollment,
would keep our armies at home
and fight only in case an enemy
attacked on this side of the At-
lantic. The smallest group regis.
tered in the poll, two per cent,
represents the students who be-
lieve the United States should
join the Allies at once.

Under what conditions do you
believe the United states should
join the Allies against Germany?

1. Only if there is actual
threat of the United states be-
ing invaded—33 per cent.

2. United States should not
juin731 per cent.

3. Only if there is actual threat
of any .American nation being in-
vaded—ls per cent.

4. Only if England and France
appear to be losing the war—10
per cent.

5. United States
nowiz per cent.

6. other condition575 per cent.

7, No opinion—4 per cent.

Germany’s "blitzkrieg" actions
are coming so fast these days, it
is hard to keep pace with the
tin . However. the above are
opi ons of the students after the
German invasion of Scandinavia.
Six months ago a poll pointed
out that 36 per cent approved of
sending troops against Germany
if the Allies appeared to he los-
ing. Today only 10 per cent ap-
prove.
