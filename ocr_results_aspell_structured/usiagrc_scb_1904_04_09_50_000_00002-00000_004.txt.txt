that the people get what they desige
and that any rel'orm in thisline would
not meet the approval of the theatre-

or labor rrnious from the standpoint of
the nor-hing man

The argument was com tuned by Mr.
Edlilonson who slioucd that through
the strike, boycott and closed .sliop
labor unions were also detrimental to
lilieelllpim iiitlrclinal allirrnat e
argument by Mr. Lori-ion. the cold or
lectsol labor unions upon the public
were pointed out, The lahtir union
l‘ostc - monopoly and di gaids public
i‘igli .
On opening the argument for the
negatire T. s. ltisser clearly donned
the terms involved and outlined the
question as apply iiig to more than the
tinitod State Ileshorved that labor
unions areanormal development that
they are now an economic necessity
and that tirey improve the condition
or the worninginan physically, mental-
ly and morally. .l. J lIecren continu»

ed the negative argument and in the,

most logical speech or the evening
showed that labor unions benelit the
employer by giving the [our essential
renuisitesorsiicccssrul business. Nor-e
mill competiLiOn, more elllclellt \VO \
irien, greater productivity arid in-
;lristrial peace are all guaranteed by
the labor name. In the tinal direct
argument n. D. Iliintiiig showed the

adrantagos accruing to society on ac-
count ol labor union ll'oilriiiginen
are prepared l'or clLiLt‘llsllili, woman
and child labor is Llleclteﬁl. Labor
problems are thereby soiled in a CD”-

in rebuttal the negative spcnlters
.hghtly surpass-ed their opponents as
did the . -o in delire The tle~
. ion or the iridges via. unanimous
lor the ucgatire. but this should not
be interpreted as meaning that the
debate has entirely one sided.
