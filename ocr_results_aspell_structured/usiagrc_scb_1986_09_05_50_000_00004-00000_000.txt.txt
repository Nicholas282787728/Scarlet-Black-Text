First, in the interest of doing business
beiore pleasure, Iwould like to make a iew
paternal remarks on the new alcohol
policy, as your loving, famerly SGA presis
dent. Although the college has not taken
the role of an eniorcing agency in the past,
and has no plans (that I'm aware of) to do
so in the near future, I think it would be in
everybody’s best interests if we were to be
somewhat mellow about our drinking
habits. This does not mean we should all
become closet drinkers. Nor does it mean
that you should turn in your roommate ii
she/he steps outside with a beer in her/his
hand. What it does mean is that the college
is in a sensitive, transitional period; if
there is no (obnoxiously) ilagrant
violating of the rulesI and no ugliness, then
our minor transgressions will be overlook-
ed, and policy will remain quite loose. it
we back the PowersrThat-Be to the Wall
early, we will only convince them that it is
time to place some real controls on the
distribution and consumption of alcohol on
this campus Enough said.

Those of you who are used to hearing me
on the ‘DIC may be surprised to find me in-
vading your lives through yet another
medium 7 the Scarlet & Black. Those of
you who know me well may be quite sur-
prised at this, given my normal disdain for

the written word. (Those of you who know
me very well will not be surprised to learn
that I overcame ﬁlls disdain with the help
of my lriend Jack.) Almough this column
will not have the great music that my radio
show does, I hope that it will be entertain-
ing, or perhaps amusing would be a better
word. (Those who still prefer the old
medium should not give up hope — I’ll be
back on the air as soon as KDIC is.)
Something must be done about the ex-
cessive amount of insects in the state of
Iowa. As I sit here, innocently typing at my
terminal, 1 am under heavy attack by a
swarm oi vicious mosquitoes, They seem
to be relentless, despite their heavy
casualties. Fortunately, the horde of flies
in my room was not as persevering as their
bloodssucking allies, One fifteen minute
melee of flies vs. fly-swatter resulted in a
remarkable fly-free room. (Although the
walls are a bit messy.) I wonder if George
' Drake gets attacked by mosquitoes when
he types. I wonder il George Drake types?
It's always the students who get the short
end of the stick.

One last though Sophie asked me to tell
you all what a wonderiul person she is, and
that she (sadly) has not had a date for a
long time. Let’s try and help her out a bit,

Quiet as a Mouse

By Michael J. Munley *

Well, here I am e the beginning of
another semester. With it comes promises
and ultimatums 00 study harder, to not
blow off my classes, and most importantly
to stay caught up with my reading and
course assignments. Somehow I have con
vinced myscli that keeping up with the
course syllabus will assure me of a good
grade. ,

I dash off to my first class where the first
order of business is the course syllabus,
Close examination ol the syllabus reveals
to me that the assignment for August 29 is
Chapters 1.3 in the course textbook. “Gee,
that's not too bad,” I think. Then I realize
that today is August 29 and I am already
three chapters behind.

In my next class the professor says that
due to Various logistical details, the class
will probably fall behind the syllabus a bit
. t . but should eventually catch up.

, This has happened to me before. All to
oiten, and [or too few reasons, my class
falls behind its syllabus. Consequently, in
spite of all my good intentions, it becomes
difficult to mirror my reading to the
syllabus because class discussion lags as
much as 11/: weeks behind.

Eventually, either through a revised
syllabus, a quick discussion, or some other

means, the professor is able to match me
last class day to the end of the original
syllabus. “

Still, what is the result? We finished the
syllabus, but how well did we cover all oi
the material? I remember one course in
particular where we spent 50 minutes of
class lecture and discussion on four books.
We finished the syllabus, but how well or
how much did we really learn?

The most obvious Solution would be to re-
quire professors to decrease the amount of
material they intend to cover in a
semester. This is an obvious solution, but it
does not get to the heart of the problem.

In my opinion, we need to redeﬁne our
emphasis in education. While I am totally
in favor oi the philosophy of study in the
liberal arts, I do not think that the
philosophy was meant to carry over to
each speciﬁc course; nor was it meant to
imply quantity.

Quality study of less material would be
far more interesting, more useful and
more educational. Someone educated in
the liberal arts ought to ‘be a generalist
with specific knowledge — not a generalist
with a general idea. I

The challenge of academics should be
focused on digesting the course material to
attain a quality understanding rather
than skimming through me quantity oi an
over-burdened syllabus,

Big Scores

By Russ Matteson

This year’s freshman class may have the
highest average board scores oi any enter-
ing class, but it appears they may also
have the biggest pocketbooks of any class.
As college Executive VicerPresidenL
Waldo Walker asked for bids, the
freshmen oflered big dollars for the items
at the SGA furniture auction

SGA'S annual furniture auction was a
tremendous success raising $1,047.00 for
the SGA treasury. As ratty couches and
chairs sold for upwards of $10.00, SGA
Auditor David Day sat shaking his head
and collecting money in disbeliel.

Perhaps the best Sale of the day was a
couch that had been drug to the auction
from its home in a ditch outside of Grins
nell. With beat-in ends and several holes in
the fabric, even this sad excuse for a couch
was sold for over 325,00

One of the enthusiastic bidders was even
heard increasing his own bid before allow
ing other bidders are opportunity to go
over his bid. In the end he walked off with
the chair he so feverishly desired, Another
bidder walked home with a bird cage and
stand.

Things have slowed down now and the
lucky bidders have moved their furniture
into their rooms, But memories of the and
tion will die slowly, as some seniors were
overheard Saying Hie auction had been the
funniest show they had seen on campus in
four years.
