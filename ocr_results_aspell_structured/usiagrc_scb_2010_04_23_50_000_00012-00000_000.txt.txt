the rest ofthose tools can wallow In obscurity.

Looking back over my fIrst two years here, I can honestly
say that Grinnell Relays was the most fun experience I've had.
(The International Bacon Day Celebration i ii close second.
The times Ive been' in my office and heard students on South
campus blasting tracks from Dr Dre's "The ChronIc 2001"
are all tied for third)

When I agreed to join a group of first years and I few
other professors on I Relays team, I had no Idea what I was
getting myself into. When 1 was given a T-shirt and promr
ised free beer,l ﬁgured I'd show up. When I saw Prof. wnync
Moyer light a toilet on fire to signal the start ofthe competi-
tion, I knew I was in the right plIce,

What made Grinnell Relays so much fun for me was not
just that my teamIThe SpIrkle Ponies,won most ofthe major
events, but that we only needed to cheat a few times to do so.
We won the Social Construction event in which we had to
represent “race" using only marshmallows and toothpicks (I
didn‘t contribute to the project so much as heckle the oppov
Ing teams), the event where we had to term a math equation
using the bodies of all ofthe team members, and the tintying
ofthe Human Knot. We would have won the Paper Airplane
Toss, too, ifit hadn’t been for those meddling kids.

Almost as valuable and important as winning (which my
team did, by the way. We won.) was the way in which the
spirit of Grinnell was very much on display during that cool,

recognize those values we hold
most dear: camaraderie, teamwork and drinking beer at 10
oclock in the morning

As I ﬁrst-year professor. I particularly Ippreeratcd the op-
portunity to interact with students outside of the classroom
Ind to get to know I may of students who I had not hId
in my courses. It is important for students and professors to
remember that in addition to recognizing and performing our
respectwe roles In terms otfcrmal education we are all part of
a larger community that is built on trust and mutual respect.
At' its best Grinnell Relays can be a carnivalesque experience
that fosters a tighter community across the campus by allow-
ing students and professors to work together toward I shared
goal in the spirit of healthy competition.

Of course, for most of those competing, the goal ofwin-
ning wIli never be achieved as long Is they‘re facing the
mlghry sparkle Ponies.

Allow me to conclude by briefly addressing those ll‘lel‘l‘r
