10/09: Classes are over, and you can
look forward to some SRC/Basketball
Flip Cup and a night of unifying de—

bauchery creeping up the horizon.

 

10/10: This is the arguably going to be
the best night of your life. But, as we all
learned in Kindergarten, after the number

10 comes the number...

10/11: Homework? Clouds? Spaetzle?
Sticky floors? Bruises? Lost cameras?
Broken cameras? The worst ”evening
that feels like a mornin" of the ear.

Issues with the smoking laws

Recently some of my ﬁrst year buddies have
been busted for smoking outside south campus.
This is malarkey. No one is going to smoke on
the sidcvimlkifcops are biking there and bust kids
for being underage smokers. Why don't we put
annseep warnings on the edge of our sidemlks
to ease escape and display how We feel about this?
Kids are just gonna smoke in your house ifyou let
cops get them for going out to the sidewalk (like
they were told to).The “No smoking on tnmpns"
should just not be enforced because it’s lame. I’m
going to smoke in my room regardless; I hope ir
gives you cancer if you wanted to push me out-
side in winter. If more kids get busted someone
should get hurt. V

.Anachronism in the newspaper

 

 

To the Editors:

With regard to the cartoon on page 12 of
the Oct. 2 581?: cute cartoon,but, FYI, not only
did many Grinnellians from the 19805 manage
to get through the decade listening something
other than Rick Springﬁeld er 11L, we also made
it through those years without ever setting foot
in Harris Center. We were much more likely to
he found in the Pub or at the Forum (or studying
somewhere). It was an easy choice, because the
Harris Center did not yet exist.
