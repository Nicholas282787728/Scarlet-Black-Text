A snappy game of bridge ended
what started out to be an interesting
football game for the spectators at
the California—Nevada game a few
weeks ago. Several Nevada fans be-

the game and spread a newspaper on
the ground, produced a pack of cards,
and a high stake game emerged from
the shadows of the goal posts.

Eugene Allen Heads
All-Dormitory Table

To Eugene Allen went the rather
dubious honor of being table head of
the all-dormitory table, which was
selected by the waiters in the dormi-
tory dining room recently. This
table represents the Walter's opinion
of the worst possible combination
that could be gathered together at
one table.

Much to upperclass consternation
the honors did not all go to fresh-
men. but included one senior, one
sophomore, and two juniors, but of
course, as is fitting and proper, the
freshmen were not forgotten.

The senior rank went to David
Bair, while Aksel Nielson and Adrian
Dunn are the juniors. Freshmen at
the mythical table are Dorrance Ny—
gaard, Robert Morgan, and Wesley
Clark.
