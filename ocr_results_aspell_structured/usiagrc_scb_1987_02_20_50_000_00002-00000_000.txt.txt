Patricia Meyer Papper, sponsor of the

Meyer Chair in International Economics,

and one oi six Women on the 37rmember
College Board of Trusteesbwas in Grinnell
last weekend for the annual February
trustee meeting. The Miami native
graduated from Grinnell in 1950.

Question: What prompted you to set up
the Meyer Chair?

Answer: 0ne ot my major interests is
economics, and business. My major at
Grinnell was economics and business andI
felt there was a tremendous need for not
just more professors in the department,
but particularly in the area oi interna-
tional trade and finance.

9: What guidelines did you give as to
what type oi candidate would till the
chair?

A: I particularly wanted someone who
was young, very scholarly, and had good
teaching experience. The applicant field
was small, and I think that they were very
careful and they came up with a few good
candidates. I think he [John Mutti] will be
extremely good for Grinnell. He wanted to
be at a small school. I think he'll be very
good with the students and I think he really
cares about teaching

Q: Grinnell students are very eager to br»
ing women and minority professors to
Grinnell. How do you feel about the fact
that there were no women or minority ap»
plicants for the position?

A: I felt very badly about that but I
understand why‘. It is because of the small
applicant pool and the competition in this
country for that kind of position that not
many minorities or women applied — i
would have loved to have seen Some. Ac-
tually, the economics department has a
black profasor and a woman and I'm very
pleased about that It would have been an
added plus to have one for this position.

Trustee behind ccon
chair shares thoughts

Q: The emphasis was on excellent
scholarship and teaching experience and
maybe the effort to recruit minority can-
didates was not made.

A: No, no, I think that minorities and
women just did not apply for the particular
job I think it’s a very specialized area. I
think there wasn't anyone who was that
good in that category.

Q: There was an article in the Scarlet
and Black this week about Grinnell's
divestment policy in South Africa The
writer of the article stated that last spring
students recommended that‘
$3,957,154-worth or stock be divested
However, the trustees approved the divest
ment of only $54,000’worth of stock Much
more divestment has taken place at other
small liberalrarts schools such as
Oberline, Carleton and Amherst, and
many Grinnell students feel that Grinnell’s
trustees do not have a moral commitment
to divestment. Would you comment on
this?

A: I don't think that's a fair assessment
I do think that the trustees are very
thoughtful and are looking into the divestr
ment problem very caretully. We now
have a special committee that s ends a
great deal of time with the students who
are intersted' in the' issue I think that 5 go-
ing to be much more productle than have
ing.. this issue coming up ateach meeting.
I think in the May meeting they re going to
come back with some recommendations to
us. The particular trustees that are on that
committee are very experienced and very
knowledgeable and have spent a great deal
of their time on this particular suject. So I
would not say that the trustees have not
been really concentrating on this subject.

Q: Do you feel that the trustees, as decir
sion makers at Grinnell College, have a
moral responsibility toward the students 'f

Grinnell teens to have

by Jennifer Halcrow

The Limit, a teen center for Grinnell and
Newburg highrschool students, will open in
March. The 1985 Naisbitt Report, commis»
sioned by the Grinnell 2000 Foundation,
identified the need for a teen center in
town. Fourteen students in grades 9
through 12 from the high school serve as
organizers for the center.

While no one interviewed disagreed with
the need for a night spot for teen-agers, the
way the teen center developed is a topic at
controversy among students and leaders
of other organizations in town. Chris Nolte,
executive vicerpresident of the Grinnell
Chamber of Commerce, said, “We endorse
the Concept that there needs to be a place
[for teens]...but we're not totally in agree-
ment with the location or the method,"
Matt Hussmann, director of the Main
Street program in Grinnell, concurred by
saying, ”I envision more involvement oi a
wider variety of people, to meet the needs
of a variety oi people. ,.I hope the Limit
will evolve into a gathering spot for a
variety of people."

A problem with the Limit, which is in a
building owned by Roger Zimmerman
near the corner of 4th and Main streets; is
its proximity to downtown bars According
to Grinnell mayor Robert Anderson.
“From the city's standpoint, the number»
one concern is the tavern on the first floor
and this is on the second floor.” Mayor
Anderson vowed to “have policement star
tioned around..,to keep kids from getting
liquor."

Another problem is the Limit‘s reputa-
tion as a center started by a clique in the
high school. Anderson said he heard that
die “facility will be patronized by 50% oi

the kids. .. The hope is they'd be encourage
ed to go by parents or kids." About hali oi
the students Who were interviewed said
they would not go to the Limit once it opens
ed. One female high school senior said the
center is organized by “a smaller group of
people.., It's deiinitely going to be a clique
hangout." She continued, saying. “Most
people want to go out and party,,.ususally
private parties, especially in the winter-
time." One male freshman, when asked
whether he would go to the center said,
“Nope. It’s going to be boring,.., There’s
not going to be much to do, it doesn't sound
like much fun.. . You can watch movies at
home.” When asked What he and his
friends usually do on the weekends, he
replied, ”Go outwith girlfriends, go to a lot
at outside parties,” According to this
ireshman, less than 50% oi the high-school
students will use the new teen center,
Another male freshman agreed, saying,
“Just certain people will be there. . We
usually just party, grab a twelve [pack of
beer] and go cruising around and party."

One male senior disagreed with the idea
that the Limit will be a clique hangout He
said, “I'm wanting to go.... We need some
place to go to, rather than drive around in
cars... They're going to have dancing and
I like to dance.” When asked how he usual-
ly spends his weekends, he responded,
“Most of the time just drive around, drink
beer and party." A female freshman also
likes the idea of the Limit; she said, “I
think it’s going to be run. I‘ll probably go
there every weekend ”

Supervisory Sergeant Darrel Lamb of
the Grinnell Police Department described
a few problems that could occur when the
new teen center opens, Grinnell has a city

A: I think that it is a tremendous respon-
sibility ior the trustees at Grinnell College
and 1 think it’s an allencompassing
responsibility. It’s not just an economic
one but you have to look at the whole pic
ture, at whats best for the students at
Grinnell and the moral aspect is certainly
a part of that.

Q: Many Grinnell students believe that
divestment is a moral issue and would lke
to see the trustees take a stand on divestr
ment without looking so much at the
political and public relations aspect of it.

A: I think that the Situation as it exists
today [South Africa] is tragic, However,
i think that we got into such long, length
discussions that we decided that those who
had more experience with it should meet
with the students, And this is why we have
this ongoing committee, and I think that's
going to be very productive,

ordinance which requires all people under
the age of 18 to be ori the streets at 11 pm.
Exceptions are granted for those who must
drive home from work or from Some
organized function. The Limit will stay
open from 9 pm. until 1 am, on Friday
and Saturday nights. According to
Sergeant Lamb, “As long as they’re up
there [at the Limit] participating, then go
straight home..,then it’s okay. But it we

have people running the streets . could
be a problem. The police department
wants to do everything we can to help."
There is concern that the Limit will not
attract the kids who normally spend time
on the streets during the weekend When
questioned on this point, superintendent of
the Grinnelerewburg school district Clem
Bodensteiner said, “I like to try
something .. If it works, super. If it
