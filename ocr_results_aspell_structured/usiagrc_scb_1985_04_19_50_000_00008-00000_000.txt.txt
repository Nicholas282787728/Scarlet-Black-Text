vacating Violence
for Social Change ,

The one,thing that I’ve learned this
year is that the use or violence as a
means to promote social justice should
never be ruled out In fact, violence,
under certain circumstances, should be
looked upon with favor and those who
uphold the revolutionary banner should
be respected by all as teachers.

l'rn not talking about terrorist acts or
the indiscriminate use of Violence by
small groups or individuals, but about
violence as used by mass reformist
movements One particular organiza
tion which I applaud tor their tactics oi
guerrilla warfare is the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front and
the Democratic Revolutionary Front
‘lFMLN-FDR) of El Salvador. They

Salvador, blown up a bridge along the
PanrAmerican highway which cut the
southern unethird of the country 011
irom the capital. set up roadblocks
along the PanrAm highway and oc-
cupied these roadblocks. And, now they
control one~third of the country.

tured army personnel, unharmed. aiter

up in a taxi around 6 pm. six on each
side oi the road, M-is's and mods in a
ready position. When ﬂley approached

the street and men I heard the gates to
my hotel hemg shut and locked. The
blackout lasted about 10 minutes. Durr
mg this time I listened tor a gun shot
which would singal me to “hit the
deck." 1 heard no shots but when the
lights came back on 1 remained in my
room, only to think about what the
Death Squads would do with a 20~yearr
old Socialist who had just come from
helping the Sandinistans continue their
revolution.

A iew days later. when l was on my
way out at El Salvador, 1 came (ace to

face with the National Guard at a road'

block someplace between Sam Miguel
and San Salvador. In El Salvador
before entering a city and after leaving
a city all buses are required to stop and
the bus and passengers searched.
Everyone is required to leave the bus
and the males must go behind the bus
and iorm a line along the roads edge.
Sometimes this was all that was re-
quired to do, but other times ID’s were
checked. This day that I was leaving
the country there had been some heavy
lighting near the highway and the road
was crowded with Salvadorlan Army
personnel As we exited the bus we
were required to interrlock our ﬁngers
and place our hands on top oi our heads.
We were then searched by one soldier
as another watched the search with his
gun aimed at our chest area.

Even though I was in El Salvador on-
ly a short time 1 got a feeling, a very
scary reeling, when I thought about the
history of the Military and the oppres-

To the Editor

In the April 12 sits article. “Students
Protest C.I.A. Presence." Robert
Lough was quoted as saying, “They

things but close them to others. So-
meone sticks their heads out the wins.
dew and yells U.S.A. out or Nicaragua.
But nobody yells KGB out oi
Afghanistan." I fail to see the logic in
his statement; students were protesting
the c.l.A.'s presence on campus.

Sure. we would be justiiied in pro-
testing the KGB it they were recruiting
on campus. However, I sincerely doubt

'that any student here is plannning a
career with the KGB. so who could be
possibly influence by protesting them
here in the middle of Iowa?

Another thought: Mr. Lough's state-
ment makes an interesting comparison.
He implies that U.S. support or the
Nicaraguan contras is indeed
equivalent to the Soviet invasion oi
Afghanistan; thus both countries are in-
volved in immoral expansionism. The
iact that present U.S. involvement in
Nicaragua is illegal and immoral is
precisely what the protesters were at
tempting to point out. — Karry Koou,

As I stood in front of my hotel I asked
the manager it people stayed out during
the night. He replied that between 10
and 10:30 pm. the people leave the
streets because the Savadorlan Army
may shoot a person who is out at night. i
wanted to remain in front of the hotel
until 10 or so to observe iirst hand the

time so I went back to my room to read

looked out my window and there was no
light to be seen anywhere,
