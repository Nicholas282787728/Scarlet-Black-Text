MEETING OF HUMEOLDT SOCIETY.

Prolessor Smiley Discusses the Sroic

Theory oi Literary Slyle.
SLDEcism ior more than three can»

ltllries exercised a berreliccnt sway

over the higher intellectual life at
Rome. The ethical content oi the
best Roman literature produced dur-
ing this period was in large measure
Stoic. Itis as diliicuit to interpret
the lrteratrrre or these three centuries
without collsidering‘ stoi ,n as it
would be to interpret the literature
or the nineteenth century without
considering Christianity. This philos-
ophy had an inllrrencc not only on the
ethical content of literature, but also
upon literary form. It demanded of
its adherents that. they should mire
an active part in public lile it lor-mrr
lated for them a very delicitc theory
of style for all public utterances. This
theory was based rrpon the following
iundamcntalconceptions: (ll Tospedk

“ to Speak the truth. (3) The
iilichron or an orator is simply to
teach and not as Cicero asserted “to
teach, to delight, to more," To stir
the leelirrgs, to rouscthe passions that
would clorrd the reason is unworthy
oian honest man. (:1) Speech to be
ideal must be in nor mony WiLll nature
and free from all drtliicizlliiy.

Out at these three fundamental
conceptions grew a theory or style

l
The presidents oi the four collegei
literary societies and the president
of the Lewis Literal-i together wrth
‘sereral students outside the societ its
mct with Proiessor Ryan Monday and
milled over the possibility oi lornring
two new literary societies in the col,
lege. A number or plans were dis:
tssed but the one generally accepted'
as most satislactor-y was the idea or a
new college society for men and an-
other for women, both to be oltlre
same nature and on the same plane as
the iour existing organ‘ itions. Most
oi those present were convinced of the
nec sity for such a step, those who
arcrrrerubers ofno society being the
most enthusiastic. A number or
other outside people. some of them
newstudcnts, have been consulted
and the general feeling seems to be
that ire hare outgrown the capacity
oi the present societies,

1; number of men and women whom

or being good organr rs were de-
signatod a possible charter members
or the new societies and further steps
willbc talrerr:to get them and others
interested in tlre;ioundiog oi the new
societies.

The prevalence ol the idea and tire
rery errderrt enthusiasm or those
most interested well for the
success of the new societies if they are
organized.
