By Sharyn Obsatz

XPLORING the various tiiSr
E tinet cultural Lraditions that

have sprouted from the same
religious text provides the theme of
Jewish Cultural Week, which begitis
today and continues through Thurs
(lily, Feb. 11.

Through food, lectures, movies,
music and dancing, the symposium
will look at “The Many Faces of
Judaism," including the practices,
situationsandeoncernsofgroupssuch
as lesbian Jews in the Unlled Suites
and Sephai'die, EUiiopian and Rus-
sian Jews abroad.

The focus represents “1| runnr
ity about how other people interpret
similar things: holidays, the Torah,"
said senior Dcvot'a Block, one ofthe
week’s coordinators. While many
Jewtshgroups may have entirely dli»
fercnt practices from as Jews, and
indeed from each other,“there is still
something that connects me to these
other Jews,” said Block.

The week is also an effort to
share Jewish culture with nonchuk
ish members of campus, said orga-
nizers. Thesymposium aims atbeing
educational, not at looking for con
verts,joked junior Joshua Ford, an-
other coordinator of the symposium.

Jewish Cultural Week is “some-

thing made for people lojoln in, for
anybody who'sctirioustiboutit,"she
said.

HE first thing 1 noticed walking into Ann
I Remington’s room were the vibrant blue and
green sixties style draperies shc was using to
fill her window overlooking East Street. She explained
to the that she had sewn thetn out ol‘an old sheet, When
we began talking about sewing she proudly pulled out
an intricate quilt that she was working on, mtide of a
mixture of calico prints.
Although Jdon’tthtnk Anti \vouldopenlyadmit it,
i think she is' itiru’st at heart. A crazy mobile thatshe
created hangs in thccornerof her room comprised ofall
ofthe orthodontics equiplnenl malxhc's gone through,
including two of the teeth she had pulled. She pointed
out the current retainer that she was supposed to be
wearing but had conveniently chosen to hang on the
mobile instead.
Two big picture frames on her wall hold a mixture
of pictures from ltigh school and college. Arm has a
great appreciation for nostalgia. When I asked about
her pictures, she proudly pulled out a photo album of a
crazy trip she took out West last summer With her best
friend in their red “85 Nelle."
On her refrigerator hangs 2i picture of Princess
Leia. Sheexplained to me thatin elementary school she

Ann and her Room

was the vice president efa Star Wars club. Because of
the lack of female roles in Star Wars she was given the
title “Princess Leiaismall” while one of her friends
was “Princess Leiaiﬁig." With a smile, she remir
nisced about a new girl who moved in and demanded to
become “Princess LeiaiMiddle." As a result Arm
unfortunately was demoted to Storm Trooper.

By her door hangs a variety ofcolorful hats, which
she explained were worn much more frequently in high
school. She says the people in her high school saw her
as a sort of avant guard figure because she always were
interesting hats, but she honestly claims that she wore
hats because she could never get tip in time to wash her
hair, making any hopes of styling it quite difficult.

On one wall beside a poster from “The Princess
Bride” hangs a long string ofRosary beads lhatadeacon
in town had given her. Ann seems to havean important
spiritual side to her, as can be seen not only in her
devotion to understanding God through the Catholic
Church but in her genuine concern to help people by
choosing to go into medicine (possibly becoming a
midwife!).

Arm‘s room posses a unique energy. The stories it
tells desribe what. Ann is all about.
