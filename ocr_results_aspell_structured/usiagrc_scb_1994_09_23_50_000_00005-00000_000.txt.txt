Dorm hallway frescoes under administrative fire

Living with white-washed walls may not be pleasant, but the alternative could cost a pretty penny

By RIVA SHARPLES
News Editor

IGNS on theentranccto James
S 2nd warn visitors and floor

members not to rub against
the hall walls because they might
smear the paint. The walls are COV»
ered in brightlyrcolorod slogans and
pictures thatthe students created dur
ing a study break several weeks ago
using tempera paint mixed with de-
tergent and water.

Other dorms, like Loose, have
also taken to painting the walls this
semester in an attempt to redecoratc
their surrounding.

Students living inthedormsare
happy with the painted designs, for
the most part. They say that they
painted the walls because “it was
fun" and because the decorations
make “living in the dorms more
pleasant."

FacilitiesManagementandSiu-
dent Affairs, however, are not as
happy about the situation as are slur
dents, They worry about possible
damage to the walls ifthe paint does
notcomeoffaccording to Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs Oda
Callison.

When Callison heard that stu-
dents were painting dorm hallways,
shecontacted theRLCs in thedorms
and asked them to caution the stu-
dents against doing it.

“[Oda Callison] basically said
that in years past it’s been done and
sometimeseven ifmostofthe paint
comes off, some of it Will seep into
theactualpaintonthewallandtherc
will be a faint trace left,” said Lori
Smoker, the RLC in Loose. “And
then Facilities Management has to

repaint, which costs money and
time."

Periodically, Callison said, stue
dents paint the hall walls, always
thinkingthatthepaintwillcomeoff.
Sometimes itdoes and sometimes it
doesn't. If it doesn't, the entire
dorm usually ends up paying a fine,
She said.

“The amount of the fine just
depends on the amount of damage
done and the colors used," she said.

The reason for the fine is that
eachsummerFacilitiesManagement
must repairany damage done to dorm
walls. The college does not leave
student creations on the wall bcr
cause “the next group of students
coming in or their parents might not
like it,“ Callison said.

Callison says that she under»
stands the desire of students to re-
decorate their surroundings and to
try to make the dorms their home.

“I can’t control what the stu-
dents do in the dorms and I under-
stand how they feel. Ijustwtsh they
would use paperinstead of the walls."
she said.

Callison is not making students
in Looseorlamesremove this year's
designs immediately. “My purpose
is to facilitate the best interests of
the students and the college,” she
said.

But students aren‘t concerned
about the threat of fines.

“lThe paint] smears a lot," said
ﬁrst year Kristina Zivich, who lives
on James 2nd. “So I think it will
come off.”

“We tried it on the wait before
westartedanditcamcoffthcn,”saitl
fellow firstryear and floormate Mel-
issa Bczanson. “It has detergent in

it, so I’m not worried about it com-
ing off.“

Wednesday, when Facilities
Managment did their annual clear-
ing ofthc hallways, they noticed the
paint on the walls for the ﬁrst time
and were concerned. Even though
most floors had received permission
to paint the walls from custodians,
they had not notified Facilities Man4
agement.

Students met with Oda Callison
Wednesday night to discuss the situ-
ation. They decided to remove the
paint sometime after October break
so that it does not have a chance to
soak into the permanent paint.

Just in case, Loose Hall is mak-
ing sure that no students are unjustly
fined for painted dorm decorations,

After Student Adviser Mindy
Foland and floormates decorated the
walls on the second floor of Loose,
sophomore Rupin Thakkar decided
to organize a dorm-wide hail deco-
rating calnpaign, according to
Smoker.

“Everyone saw how nice Sec,
ond South looked and they wanted
to do it," she said.

Working with other student ad-
visers in Loose, Thakkar contacted
students living in Loose by email
and explained the risks ofbeing part
of the plan to paint the walls.

”He asked anyone who didn‘t
want to be held responsible to come
forward," Smoker said.

Smoker said that some people
did come forward and Thakkar now
has a llstofthose people in his room.
The list is less than ten, he said. If
the tempera-waterrdctergcnt paint
mixture used in Loose fails to come
off the walls, those people will not
be asked to pay.
