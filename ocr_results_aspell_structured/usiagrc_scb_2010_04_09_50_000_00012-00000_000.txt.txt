“There was a general consensus that stu-
dents didn’t talk to each other enough about
intellectual activities." He pointed out that
he meant discussion that is not necessarily
about classroom work, but rather topics that
have provided enough stimulation that stu—
dents would be moved to do some indepen—
dent thinking.

The forgotten holiday

Holidays are a rim: to reﬂect. Let us ponder
the renewal of spring, the revival oflife. Let us eel-
ebrate life itself dancing amongst us, ﬁtcdjtated hy
the sun’s renewed friendliness.

i am, oteourse, speaking otthe soeial process
sion of this past sunday, “anything goes trash-day,"
“big trash day”or, as the wisest among us sny,“r.hc
oiay where you can ﬁnd free shit curbside to use
as your individuality ean imagine."i’ea, verily, free
shit is among us and ler us utilize it. Verily, yo.

This moment is one for reuse. A day for resale
izing the cliched truth that one man’s trash is anr
other’s treasure. That old radar-range unplugged
is a primo—storage shelf—that broken coffee table
can become a comical coffee-table-book display»
board. Let us use our deviant minds to create value
in the socially valueless. l—loly day, Trash Day. may
your spirit never leave us.

The best thing about today

So remember thar one time when it was Tuesr
clay and there was that epic storm and the power
went out and everyone was like, “W000! Power
out! No class {or three days! It’s the weekend”
and then the power went back on at 4:00 am.
and basically nobody noticed and most people
slept through their VVedncszlny morning classes
and things went back to normal and it wasn‘t the
weekend anymore but then the power went out
AGAIN and everybody was like “VVOOO! Power
out! No class for three days! It’s the weekend" and
then it went back on like twenty damn minutes
later and things went back [0 normal and then it
wasn't the weekend anymore AGAIN and every-
thing was kind ofsad heeanse Thursday was sunny
but it was kind of cold kind oflike how it gets in
the beginning ofwinrer?
