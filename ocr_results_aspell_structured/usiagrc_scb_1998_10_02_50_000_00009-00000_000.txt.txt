To rhe ediror,

Last week 1 was very upser afrer reading a
copy ofrhe Scarler and Black. 1 found rhar on
she from page 1 was horribly misquotcd. Larer
in she paper some misinformarion was also
given. Journalisric inregriey is something rhar
should be observed by any newspaper, and
especially a publiearion from one ofrhe rop
liberal arrs colleges in thc narion.

The quality ofrhis paper _ wirh rhe gcnv
eral lack of "news" had been disappoinring
and discouraging. The misinformarion and
misquotation in mis pasr issue was ounageous.
1was quoted as saying, “Norshern and South-
ern Express suck." Nor only was rhis quot:
nor mine, bur it was arrrihured ro me and my
name was even misspelled. This quot: is nor
only a misquotc, but also a misrepresenrarion
ofmy feelings. The quore is also nor rhe syn-
tax rhar 1 would use in an inrerview. This rep-
resenred me as being a rude person and ex—
pressed ieelings rhar 1 did not have. 1 do feel
rhar me pricing srruerure ar Norrhern and
Sourhern Exptcss is somewhar high. bur rhe
service irself is beneficial so all rhose on board
plans ar rhis college. The quote as ir was given
was unnecessary and our oi place in she ar-
riele.

Anothcr insrance of blaranr laziness in re—
porring sryle, and a lack ofjoutnalistic inreg.
riry was rhe arricle on 1owa City. Speaking
from my posirion as currenr co-manager of
Bob’s underground 1 can rell you with full
conﬁdence rhar in my rime as manager Bob’s
has never once ordered or purchased any of
our producrs from rhe lam Ciry Coop. Prior

ro my posirion as manager 1 am nor aware of
any poinr in rhe Bob’s six year history that
anyrhing was boughr or ordered from rhe lam
Ciry Co—op. Bob’s currenrly orders many of
our producrs from Tree or Life, a wholesale
whole and healrhy foods disrriburor based in
Indiana. We also ofier a service so rhis campus
where srudenrs, faculty and sraif can order
producrs rhrough us and our disrriburor. This
is one ofrhe currenr merhods ofohraining food
for she Vegan Co-op. 1 have no idea where you
gor rhe informarion rhar Bob's uses rhe lowa
City Coop, it obviously did nor come from
us, or she coop. 1n rhe rurure when informar
rion is nor known please ask, do nor make it
up. Your funcrion as reporrers is nor ro make
up news, bur ro reporr it.

[expect rhar a correcrion will be prinredin
rhe next issue oirhe socb. Your sloppy report-
ing and poor ediring has misrepresenied my—
selfon an individual level, and also Bob‘s and
discredirs some of our currenr services. 1 do
expect a correerion (or she reporring char was
done on 1owa Ciry, rhough 1 would appreciare
an apology for rhe blatant misquoution 1 will
only ask rhar you cease rhis praerice oimaking
up quores ro express feelings rhar you may have
as a paper.

Thank you.

Dear Grinnellians,

This pass Sarurday niglrrasad and disrurb.
irig event occurred on our campus. 1 was rhe
recipienr ofhomophobic graifui. The gramri
referred ro me engaging in sexual acrlviry. This
is nor appropriare anywhere, bur especially nor
here as Grinncll.

More rhan rwo years have passed since 1
came so rerms wirh my sexual orienrarion and
realized rhar 1 had noshing so be embarrassed,
or ashamed abour. 1 am a gay man and ir is
nor somerhing 1 hide. 1 am our ro my tamily,
friends and church. Tomorrow, Ocrobcr A, is
lason and my one year anniversary. Jason is
she person l have dreamr abour all army life,
he holds me when 1 am down and he celebrares
with me when 1 am happy, Tucker is also a
resulr ofrhis relarionship. He is my 3.year.old
son and Jason's biological child, All in all 1 have
norhing ro hide and norhing ro be ashamed
of oh, and as in any hcalthy commirred rela-
rionship, sexual acriviry does exist, as leasr for
she fuss few years and is norhing to be ashamed
of

Now, I wouldlike to call on th: enrirecam.
pus community; 1 would like so ask each and
every one ofus so stand up and say no to this
rype ofbehavior. 1_er your voice be heard, nor
only here on campus, bur in our ssrengrh
spread beyond campus boundaries, Ler it nor
only be applicable ro sexual orienrarion, bur
include respecr ofall individuals regardless of
sex, race, color, age, creed, narional or erhrric
origin, and disabiliry. This is your charge. Help
pur a srop ro rhis desrrucrive behavior.
Sincctcly,
