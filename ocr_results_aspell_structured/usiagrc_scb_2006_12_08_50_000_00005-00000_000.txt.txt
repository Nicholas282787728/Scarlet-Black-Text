Grinnell planned Fireplace
Lounge to be a spot for so-
cial gatherings and hanging
out. instead, it has become
the hottest-new study space
on campus. In contrast,
the Creative Computer
Lab (CCL), one of the most
technologically advanced
labs on campus, is virtually

unused by students.

With the recent changes on campus, stur
dents have found new spaces to get work done.
Though there are old favorites, like Burling
Library and Bucksbaum, students have mixed
reactions to new areas like the Creative Com»
puter Lab and the Fireplace Lounge,

The CCL, located next to ITS in the F07
rum,was recently opened as a study space. New
large screen iMac computers don the tables, a
coffee and cocoa bar is available with the use of
a Prcard, and the Helpdesk is not 20 feet from
the area in case a computer goes on the frin,
but few students are found using this space.

“I don't believe that the CCL has struck
the correct balance for student use or stu-
dent interest as of yet," said SGA President
Chris Hall. “Personally, I don’t know if there
is enough widespread need on campus for the
CCL to ever be signiﬁcantly popular. Maybe
more education and awareness is the ticket—
I’m not completely sure.”

Initial feedback to the CCL was negative.
“I would never study here," said Chris Mayer
'07. “I don't like open spaces where I’m going
to be around people. This environment could
be somewhat distracting to me."

But some students who stumbled on the
CCL found it to their liking. Pnul Kramer'Og,
who had never been to the lab before, came out
of convenience.

“I came because I was tiied so I got some _

coffee, and it’s quiet so Ijust sat down to read,"
said Kramer. “l’Ll probably stop by again and
see if it's .is quiet because I can't read with
distractions."

Others are doing just that. “Since I found
this place I’ve been studying heie pretty regu-
larly, it‘s nice because you got some uprtordatc
Apple computers." said Gary ltnhn'o9."1t's a
comfortable setting in which to type papers,
get work done, etc. ”

cat Pierre he agrees. “There's a lot of
light, the computer screens are 'big," she said,
"It just is a place where I feel like I can get
work done."

Unlike the CCL,which has had trouble es-
tablishing itself as a study space, the Fireplace
Lounge in the JRC has turned into a popular
place to work, even though this was not neces
sarily its initial purpose.

”The Fireplace Lounge wasn't originally
intended to be anything other than a lounge,"
said Hall. ”How exactly it was to be used is
something that the architects and designs
ers felt that students would ﬁgure out on our
own." i

From its opening, the space has been a
quiet place for students to get their work done.
“It’s central but a lot quieter than the Grill,"
said Matt Horowitz '10, who started studying

in the lounge as soon as ho could.

Jessica Cheney'09 also appreciates the our
at and believes that many features of the room
make it a good place to do work. “The light-
ing is conducive to studying," she said. “And
it has some of the only comfortable furniture
on campus."

Some students who use the Fireplace
Lounge figured it out by chance. “I was just
getting something from the Grill and I had
my stuffwith me, so I just came to the FIYC‘
place Lounge" said Alexis Stern ’08.

Other students found the Fireplace
Lounge to be a good change of scenery. “I was
just looking for a new spot because Burling
was getting old," said Lauren Hester '09. “I'll
probably come back thoughlt's nice and quiet
here."

Many think the lounges popularity will
only grow. “It's the library of the lot Rosenfeld
Center," said Horowitz.

There does seem to be one common com-
plaint though: “It would be nice if they Lit the
fireplace occasionally," said Cheney.

4 study spots you might not know

Burling has a secret sectionithe fourth
floor. While seniors are generally well aware
of the possibilities of the hidden upper ﬂoor,
first-years may not yet have found this cone
of silence.

For some students, this area offers the
best of the library and of academic building.
”There are resources that you can’t get in your
room," said CJ. Chamberlain '08.

Others find the intense working almlr
sphere to be a good motivator. “I sometimes
study here because in have work to do I know
I can get work done here,I force myself to get
woik done here," said David Rein ’07.

Little known Fact: Mears Cottage is open
at night to students. Get in before 11 and you
can spend the night (albeit locked in)!

Kirby Ramstad ’08 started studying in the
building with groups of friends a few weeks
ago. Now she goes “a couple times a week."

“It’s really quiet,” she said. “But its more
comfortable than the library."

The living room has numerous seating arr
rangemcnts, and upstairs are tucked away ale
coves for students with a lot to do.

“Since nobody really comes through there,
you have agency to study the way you want to
study,” said Ranistnd.

Many students have their fingers crossed
that (Lind will once again be a place for stu-
dents to meet, this time as a study space. A
student initiative asking to convert Quid to a
study space passed with 89.8 percent.

Chris Hall '07, SGA President was enthur
siastic about the possibility of converting the
room. “I believe that most adiuinistrators un»
derstand our strong interest in making it into
a study space, and we’ll continue to push for it
behind the scenes,"he said in an email.

But according to Tom Crady, vice presir
dent for Student Services, Qiad may instead
become a special dining hall.

Even with all the sounds of music and art
tools, Bucksbaum is a quiet place to study.
Since it received a P-Card reader last year,
students have 24»hour access to the space. It
has been a lessdmown study space with its
own following ofstudents who go to abadoned
classrooms to do their work. Many discover it
after taking art or music classes.

Camille Lindsey-Larrabee '10 went to
Bucksbaurn to do het‘drawing homework and
ended up bringing otherwork along.

Next semester, she will try studying in the
piactice rooms. “Those are really quiet, gets
away places," she said.
