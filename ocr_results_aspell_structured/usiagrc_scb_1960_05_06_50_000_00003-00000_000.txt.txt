In the years between 1945
and 1960, as mayor and as sen»
ator, Hubert Humphrey estab»
lished a public record on the
issues that are the basis for his
candidacy. His campaign will
be misunderstood—and unsuc—
cessful—il he is thought oi only
as a personality.

He is running as a friend of the

‘sunshine of human rights." i

l Humphrey was elected to the
lSenate that November, and there
lho has continued to make his
,record, constantly cat-sponsoring
jand voting for the Douglas Javlls

First, the problems oi agricul-

not unrelated. tor the most
crucial issues in agriculture is
not production but distribu—

At home. too, there are other;
”works ot prosperity" (if I may‘
coin the phrase), including feder-
al aid to education, health care,
tor the aged and more efforts to

' help the mentally ill and the
physically handicapped-AS the
senator says. “The real measure

concern with those in the dawn
of hie, in the twilight of lite and
in the shadows of lite."

Humphrey began to establish
his liberal record on the civil
rights issue as mayor of Miir
