“EAST ls WEST”

Just as “Smilin‘ Through" was
Norma Tallnndge's ﬁrst really big
production, so docs the forthcoming;
prcsentation of “East IS West" mark
sistci- Constance‘s debut in the ﬁeld
of drama and famous play adopta-
tions. Ever since "East Is West",
completed its two year run on Broad-
way and proceeded to create further,
records as a road show, it has been
held as a prize for some screen star
who wished to do something of a Sen—
sational nature and would pay the
price. That it has fallen to Con—
stance Talmadge is an indication of
hcr ncw intention to iorget the dc-
ligluful frivolilics ol the past and to
make future productions equally ue~
liglltiul in drama, not to the absolute
exclusion of comedy howcver.

Sidney A. Franklin, who directed
“Smilin‘ Through" and also this pro-
ducticn, has invcstcd it with a
wealth of gorgeous Chinese back-
grounds and general technical ex-
cclleucc in keeping with what Miss
Talmadgc provides. “East is West"
will be seen at the strand Theatre
Wednesday and Thursday. ~

Meats Girls Give a '
Thanksgiving Party

One of the features of Thanksgi ng
vacation was a very informal party
given by Mom-s Cottage Sunday even—
ing immediately cftcr lunch for the
rest or the girls in the Quadrangle.
Entertainment was provided by the
luears girls in the form of a Christmas
program given, in costume, by tho
primary department of a. Sunday
school. A pompous. bewhiskel'ed sup-
erintendent Wits there. and an ever-
worked teacher, anxiously prompting
from the front row, while the darling
little tots stammered through their
songs and spoke their pieces. Apples,
nuts, and candy were served after the
program, and guests and Sunday
School‘tugether gathered around the
fire and sang Christmas songs.

Dr. Lloyd W. Taylor (Grinncll '14)
of tbo departmentof Physics of the
University of Chicago, presented a pa-
per before the Chicago meeting of
The American Physical Society, De-
cember 1st, on ”The Projection of P0-

Professor Grass says that before

"There is a great need of use money
systems of the world being unified
so that the same sysctin would be
used in all parts of the world, This
movement is coming sooner or later
as the nations grow together but the
war made it an impossible step for
this generation. It follows along with
a universal language and a universal
system of Weights and measures. Un-
doubtcdly it will be one on use foun—
dation stones of a world economic
system. One of the greatest ideas
which has come into the world is that
of an international political organi-
zation, us a league of nations, which

ture of the human family. It is the
most practical way of attaching thc
human brotherhood problem."
