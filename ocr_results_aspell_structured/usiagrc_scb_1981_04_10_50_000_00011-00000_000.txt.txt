their 16th annual Spring Folk Dance
Concerts at 7:30 p m. in Darby Gym.
They promise to be fast-paced evenings
of fun for all who attend.

Folk dancing has a long and eventful
history at Grinnell, Originally a club
With a handful of members who met
once or twice a week to dance, the

group has grown steadily in popularity
and membership. Sixteen years ago, an
enterprising faculty adviser suggested
giving performances and the spring
folk dance festival has been a traditlon
ever since,

No longer do group members restrict
themselves to a single periormance a
year but they pertorm as olten as possi»
ble; regularly for such campus events
as Parents' Weekend, Slavic Weekend,
often for Jewish Cultural Weekend,
special occasions such as last year's

benefit (or Cambodian relief and shows
at local nursing homes.

Such a list of activities is all the more
striking when one considers the enor-
mous amount of work that it requires.
Choreography, lighting, sound and all
the other technical details involved in
such productions are handled by

students, none ot whom are theatre ,
dance majors, but who nonetheless,«
sometimes spend as many as five hours

a night hard at work in Darby Much
time is spent on costumes, as eachvof
the group‘s 20 to 30 members wear
several different outfits in a single pro; 1
duction. These costumes are all hand: ,
made and the designs, which represent

a score of nationalities, are thoroughly
researched. In addition, new costumes .
are always needed. The group's repe
wire of dances increases each year, as
diiierent members pick up new ste
learned at workshops around the can

try, This year, tor instance, the grou ,
Will present a medley of Mexican
dances and a Taiwanese women’s .
dance

In order to maintain such a reper-
toire, dance steps are passed from up», -
perclassmerl on down during two~hour
teaching sessions every Wednesday
and Sunday. Professional dancers ar
brought to campus at the expense oi the
group's small budget to demonstrate
new techniques. Dancers travel as far
away as Chicago to learn new steps,
purchase new music and meet others
who share their mania.

Yes, folk dancing is a madness but an '
immensely enjoyable one in which all
can share This communal spirit is the.
true spark which inspires Grinnell’s
dancers; they share a feeling of “we're
all-in-this togetherrsoebyegollyalet's-
have-a-goodrtime.“ The periormances
are not formal; on the contrary,
dancers clap, stamp booted feet widly,
swish llowmg skirts and billowing pet-
ticoats and tlirt outrageously, all iri
time to the music, Even some pro-
fessors get into the act during the
popular iaculty dance. So come to Dar»
by at 7:30 pm. either Friday or Satur:
day. You’ll be glad you did.
