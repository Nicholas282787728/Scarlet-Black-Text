Repubican party represents one single
ideology, an ‘American ideology,‘ The
Repulicans are too parochial to have
wide appeal. In my opinion, they are
concerned with America first, rather
than with the American people first,”

Stowe went on to comment that he
considers the Republican party
“ideologically blind."

Presently the College Democrats
are attempting to bring Carter. Vice
President Walter Mondale, or some

other major ligure in the Democratic

party to Grinnell as a tollow-up to the
Kennedy visit.

B&S sponsored drink-in goes quietly

by Bob Kleine

Can Grinnell students drink in the
Forum without being rowdy? In the
past, the administration has said no,
so last Wednesday the 3&5 staff
organized a campus-wide “Drink-In"
which was held in North Lounge. The
Drink-In was designed to emphasize
the civilized manner in which Grins
nellians can conduct themselves.
However. according to one Forum
worker, “I heard that it took 12
buckets of water to clean up the
f loor,"

Essentially, the Drink-In was
organized only a couple of days before
it was scheduled. In spite of the cur
rent no drinking policy in the Forum,
the administration felt it could not in
terfere, since intervention would only
strengthen Sentiment against the ad-
ministration. ,

Dean Waldo Walker commented,
“The Drink-In was obviously a spon
taneous demonstration of interest and
was successful in acknowledging some
students' wishes."

The 3&8 staff never did get a firm
note of approval from Forum Super»
visor Jenny Erickson. One of the
organizers, Bennett Lasko, stated,
“Even though no official approval was
given, the Forum Staff did help us set

up, and also supplied the amplifier {or r'

the music."

Peter Kornhaber, another organizer.
stated, “We picked North Lounge
because the Forum has ‘let go'
previously and allowed such events as
Skip Day and Senior Day to be held
here,"

Walker responded to this by come
menting, “North Lounge is virtually
indestructable and very little harm
can actually be done to it."

Walker appreciated the orderly
behavior of the participants. but
stated, “We have no intention of
changing our policy of ‘no drinking

and Smoking.’ " He also skated that

there are many expensive pieces of
furniture in the Forum that Could be
damaged and that perlormers
generally do not enjoy performing to
an audience which is less than atten»
tive.

The Drink~ln was a well organized
demonstration of some students’ feel»
ings. There were no lights nor
disorderly conduct. in general, the
participants were wellsbehaved.

However, it remains unknown
whether the Drink-In will have any
real effect on the administration's
policy guidelines.
