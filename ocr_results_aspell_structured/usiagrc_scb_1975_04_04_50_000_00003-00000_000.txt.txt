At the corner of Fifth Avenue and Main Street sits
a gaping hole littered with bricks and broken pipes.
Around this Vacant lot, where the Colonial Theater
used to stand, is a garbagerbarrel-supported
wooden fence and a damaged sidewalk.

Grinnell College is presently attempting to sell
this eyesore.

The Colonial Theater was partly given and partly
sold at a bargain price to the college by an in-
dividual from Des Moines who was associated with
the Central States Theater Organization. Before the
college obtained the building in late 1973, the theater
had stood empty for 20 years. Robert Anderson. the
college treasurer, explained that by the time the
college owned the theater, only a shell remained.
The interior and roof were a shambles and the
util es were not working or were in urgent need of
repair. Mr. Anderson viewed the building as,
“large, ugly and non»usable." The cost of refurr
bishing the building would have been too great an
investment from the college’s standpoint. Wimout a
need for a building in downtown Grinnell, the
college knocked it down, ”after the Christmas
shopping rush," in early 1974, said Anderson.
During die razing, the sidewalk around the site was
damaged. '

fl‘he college then fenced the area ott. During the
past two days, this barricade has been bolstered by
addition of metal poles by Buildings and Grounds
personnel.

Last fall, the town notified the college that they
should carry out the necessary repairs on the
sidewalk. Temporary asphait and patching was put
in. with full repair due later on, The city manager,
Ted Clausen, blamed the B St G strike in the fall,
iollowed by winter setting in, {or reducing the efr
fectiveness of the sidewall-K’s repairs

THERE'S A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK

THE All. NEW
OPEN 3 P.M.-2 AM.

Last week a woman stumbled and fell on the
sidewalk surrounding the site. But Anderson did not
want to relate this incident to the disrepair of the
sidewalk, saying that the “evidence is in-
conclusive”.

The college has been reluctant to fill in the ex-
cavation, since the hole could be used to hold the
foundation of a new edifice, if the land is sold, Ans
derson stated that “ii the property is not sold by
next building season, the gaping hole will be filled
my

Clausen does not feel that the college has been
neglecting the property. “As long as the barricades
are there, 1 would not call it a salety hazard”, he
said. Clausen added that although he does not
consider the site esthetically pleasing, he feels that
the area will eventually be cleaned up. But the city
manager has no knowledge of the college’s plan
concerning the hole, except that it is up for sale.

Bill Weeks, of Ramsey-Weeks Inc., the real estate
agency the college is selling the land through, called

'the property a “prime piece of ground, whose sale

has been hindered by the present economic
situation”. Weeks pointed out that there have been
prospective buyers. “The college has gotten an
offer, ‘but not a satisfactory after”. he stated. The
college originally wanted about $40,000 for the land,
but their asking price is now below that figure. in an
oli-the-cuii judgment, Weeks predicted a ﬁnal
selling price of about $35,000.

Weeks said that he has not heard it the town was
intetested in the property “but rm not saying they
are not interested." So far, “strictly business in

terests” have been in touch with Weeks {or the
purchase oi the hole.

Library stacks grow

Recently the Burling Library
replaced their old periodicals
shelving with seven new stacks.

The new aluminum with wood»
based shelving has a maximum
capacity of displaying 1,120
periodicals, as opposed to the 512
maximum capacity that was
stacked in the area previously.
Currently thelibrary receives 1,230
Journals, 100 of them being
displayed in the science library.
Christopher McKee, the librarian,
said thatthe {ormel‘situation led to
many periodicals being shelved in
the downstairs stacks, “where
hardly anybody realized they
were."

The Library Committee had
priced the cost ol adding three new
units oi the old type oi sheiving,
But since this was customrmade
[or the Skidmore, Owings at Merrill
architectural firm, the Cost would
have been $5,000 more than the
purchase oi the replacement
shelving. The new equipment is the
standard library type which can be
added onto [or a low cost

The iunds (or this renovation
came from the Gardner-Cowles
Foundation. Currently, hall of the
gift money, a ilve»year grant in
$200,000 installments which began
in 1972, is earmarked tor iaculty
salaries, The rest goes to other
categories including the library
budget.

The shelving renovation was

decided upon by the Committee [or
a number of reasons. McKee said,
“we got a good bargain on the
purchase.” The new shelving cost
$6,150. McKee felt that if the
library added journals rather than
the new iixtures, “there would
have been no way to continue
subscriptions since this is onetime
gift money.” “We also have an
adequate periodical collection for
the size or the library; the largest
of the A.C.M, schools," McKee
added. Currently the library
spends $121,600 ior books.
periodicals and recordings.

Two units of the old shelving will
be converted for use in the
reference room. McKee tell that
this will avoid the need for new
shelving in the reierence room in
the foreseeable future. “From a
number oi angles the new shelving
was a thritty option,” McKee
stated.

New physical renovations will
also include new display cases for
the 20th Century Room. McKee
does not ioresee too many other
new improvements, “The
physical Work is just about done,
These were the first real imr
provements since 1053 and were
necessary," McKee stated. He
added that the library's biggest
problem now is the size of their
book collection,
