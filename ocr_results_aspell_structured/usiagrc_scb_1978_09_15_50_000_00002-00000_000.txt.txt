Vice President Kiefer resigns

Tom Kiefer, SGA vice president,
submitted a letter of resignation to
President Greg Youtz Monday.
Kieferi ciles a larger-thaneane
ticipated academic workload, and
problems with his personal
political philosophy as his chiei
reasons for quitting.

Commenting about his political
philosophy, Kiefer saysHim an
anarchist. In ru.. ng tor and
accepting the job of vice president
I really compromised my prin
ciples. I've felt uneasy about it7
since I decided to resign I feel
much more comfortable.”

Both Kiefer and Youtz stress that
Kiefer 's resignation has nothing to
do With ideological differences
between the two Youtz says, “I'm
sorry to see him go, When we were
elected last year I had doubts
about us working together, but
we've gotten along line He will be
missed ”

“We do have a good working
relationship," Kieier adds.

Youtz is concerned that the
student body may misinterpret the
resignation, Ideological dif-
ferences between the two played no
part in Kiefer’s action

Kiefer Says he Will retain no
official role with SGA, though he
plans to continue “taking swipes
at them from the outside "

The SGA, Youtl feels, will be
hurt by Kiefer’s departure. “Tom
had experience that helped a lot,”
Youtz begins. “The new Vice
president will have to work with a
cabinet that he or she had no part
in forming, and that could hurt.”

A tentative date for election of a
new vice president has been set ior

Wednesday, October 4. Kiefer‘s
resignation is effective when a new
vice president is elected, or on
October 11, whichever comes first.

Speaking about the new vice
president, more. says, “I wish
whoever it is a lot of luck. The job
takes slightly more free time than
a person has,"

Clark addresses foreign policy

by Mark Finkelslein

Iowa Senator Dick Clark brought
his rerelection campaign to
Grinnell last Saturday Clark, a
powerful voice in the formulation
oi American ioreign policy, is
being challenged by Republican
Roger Jepsen

Clark began his brief presen-
tation by outlining the importance
of Grinnellians in his political
career. He spoke of his admiration
ior Harry Hopkins and other “New
Dealers” from Grinnell, He also
mentioned members of his
senatorial and campaign staffs
who are recent Grinnell graduates.

THEN HE TURNED to the
discussion topic, American ioreign
policy. Beginning with Western
Europe. Clark discussed his views
on various issues iacing the
divergent regions of the globe He
said that quantitative studies of
NATOrWarsaw Pact military
strength are misleading, and that
our basic system oi alliances in
Europe is still strong,

Next. addressing our relation
ship with the Soviet Union, Clark
asserted, ”There is a kind of
natural antagonism between the
United States and the USSR,” due
to the ideological differences which
exist between the two Super
powers. He maintained, “the
critical thing In American-Soviet
relations is that we find a way, with
our separate systems, to live in the
same world together, To me, that's
all detente means. ,The most
important thing we can do in this
effort is to find it way to limit

nuclear arms.”
I”? THEN MOVED to the Middle

East situation with a special note
oi hope ior the Camp David talks.
He contended that “probably the
area oi the world where the

' superpowers would be most apt to

come in conﬂict is the Middle
East " He also commented that
“llle President cannot force an
agreement on either side,” Clark
feels that the United States should
not put military iorces into the
Middle East. He thinks this
militarization would only set the
stage ior the entrance oi Soviet
forces into the area.

Clark spoke oi two major policy
changes regarding the Far East
which will take effect in the near
future. He defended the pull-out of
American ground forces irom the
Republic oi Korea, on grounds that

ty both militarily and diplomati»
cally. Regarding America's China
policy, Clark believes “We have to
move now for the normalization of
relations with the People’s
Republic of China.” He added that
recognizing the People's Republic
as the government of China would
involve breaking off diplomatic
relations with Taiwan. but that
some contact with Taiwan should
be retained

CLARK CONDEMNED past
administrations for thEir African
policies, while commending the
Carter administration for bringing
Africa to the forefront. He declared
that. ”the United States has an
important role to play

economically and diplomatically
but not militarily."

Clark, one of President Carter's
strongest Capitol Hill supporteXS.
admitted that difficulty arises in
understanding American foreign
policy because of the conﬂicting
views of Brzezinski, Vance and
Young. He stated that an ace
curate gauge of American foreign
policy can be found only in Carter's
own statements.

HE CONCLUDED. "r‘resment
Carter has many admirable
qualities One of them is honesty——
we haven‘t always had that." On
the other hand, he added. ”there's
not enough talent on the White
House staff ”
