Harrier Outlook
Bright; 5 Vels

With three returning letter»
rnen, two veterans or last year,
and sophomore helip, the 1955
Pioneer cr -L‘ountry outlook is
bright. George Drake, twice
conlercnce mile champ in track,
will be coach E. G. Booth's bigr
gest gun in the quest tor [he
Midwest conference trlie.

in addition to Drake,
winners are Lar-y Schalegcr and
Bob Downs. Fr z Goreham and
Dan Ver Ploeg should both be
much improved alter a year or
seasoning.

All ol the above mentioned
evcept Vel' Ploeg were members
of the team which last your in
the conlerence cro country
meet finished second to Ca
ton. Only Dave Qutub, who is
staying on this year as assistant
lreshman roach, and Franl»
Hays were lost lrom last year s
squad,

Much needed squad depth rs
expected to come from a couple
or sophomore hopefuls, John
Her-mg and John Weldon. These
seven ‘men comprise the nucleus
or the team although there are
several late reporters expected.

Carleton may again he the
team to heat in the loop race,
although Monmouth, who last
year irelded an exceptionally
strong freshman harrier team,
Will also be tough along with
Grinnell .

It is possible that this season,
for the first time rn many years.
all the conference schools will
have teams.

The tentative pioneer sched-
ule, which is subject to several
changes, rneludes {our home
meets over the thrceem-ile
course, the start and finish of
which are in Ward held. Big
meets on the agenda will be the
conference meet, the Midwest
A. A. U, meet in Des Mornes,
and the N c, A A. test in East

Lansing, Mich.

contercncc scoring leader, ful-
back Duane Brekkch, returns.
along with Mark Rernertson.
regular signal caller.

me Offense Tricky

Paul Quam, all-conference and
little all—American center, heads
a line which will average
around zoo—lbs, compared to
Gi-innell's 185 average. Buzz
llelseth. who co captains the
squad along with Quam, teams
at tackle with Bill Lund. Other
pillars in the forwald wall are
Dave Bolstorff at guard and
towering ends Erv Mikklesoo
and Bruce Halverson.

Ole coach Ade Christianson
utilizes a deep T formation,
featuring outside running and
trap plays. Deception is a
characteristic of Ole teams.

Grinnell‘s chances he m the
ability of many at the team’s
stalwa ts. especially in the
trout line, to last a (nil 607
minutes. Although the Pioneers
have an averagc sized squad,‘
the reserves lark experrencc, a,
situation which should be lm-l
proved towards the middle oi
the season, Many squad mem-
bers will see duty at two poslr,‘
lions. ‘
