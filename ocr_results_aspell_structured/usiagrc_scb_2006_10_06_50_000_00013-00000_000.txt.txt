Palmer speaks

l wanted to take the opportunity to let Grinnell College sure
dents know a little bit about why I'm running for the Iowa House
and about who 1 am. In particular, I wanted to talk to you about the
values I'd bring to the Iowa legislature and how important this elece
[ion is for the future of the entire country,

It's time for government to be held accountable and it's time
for change. Changing the makeup ofthc legislature in Des Moines
will send a strong signal to politicians in DC, that “politics as usual"
is not an option. For far too long our leaders in Des Moines have
ignored the plight of Iowa’s minimumewage workers. lfelected, an
increase in the mrnrmum wage, with no strings attached. would be
one of my first priorities 1 would not vote for an increase in my
legislative salary until Iowa's minimumnvilge earners have gotten
a raisc.This isn't an issue that earns you major PAC contributions.
This is an issue that’s about people.

Soil and writer conservanon programs have also been victims of
underfunding and cuts for many years. I’m a firm believer in im-
proving Iowa’s quality of life to help encourage college students like
yourselves to stay in Iowa after graduation. Ifwe are serious nborrt
attracting new residents to the state we need to emphasize environ-
mental and quality oflife issues in the legislature.

I hope that all ofyou take the time to get a full understanding of
the issues and take the opportunity to vote in the upcoming election.
satellite voting is on Oct. 9 and it's a big responsibility, Choosing
your elected ofﬁcials is one orthe most important rights any of us
can exercise, Our state is at a crossroads and I would be honored to
have your vote at such an important tiinc.

Defend the team

I must sayl frnti lnsrweek's opinion column bashing the football
team to be in very poor taste. 1 would also like to say that there are
some aspects of this column that I will not address directly. These
aspects deserve attention and rebuttal, but Pat Ritter '08 has already
dettly handled them on the socBlog.

What I would like to address is the incredible level of com-
mitment required to play any sport, especially football, at such a
competitive level, The football team practices for hours a day, lirrs
weights multiple times per week and engages in a grueling three-
hour marathon competition every Saturday. They devote an incred-
ible number of hours to it every week. At the very least they should
be respected for their devotion to their teammates and their sport.

It is very difficult to field a football team at this school. The
consistent problem for this team hasn‘t been a lack of athletic abil»
ity; it has been a lack ofathlctcs.The current rostcr sportsjusr over
40 players,which is an unbelievably small football team at any level.
Factor in the inevitable injuries a team sustains in a season, and that
number shrinks further. At the end of last season the team barely
frelded 30 players.That may sound like a lot, but when you need ll
starters On offense, defense, and special teams, 30 isn't that many

Any athlete will tcll you that losing sucks. All that time and
energy spent practicing, all that time and CilCrgy spent training. All

those bruises, broken bones and torn ligaments seem for naught.
Losing is not fun,That is why it is so impressive that on Monday,
they put their pads back on and go back out to the practice field. It
is not easy. But hey, if it was easy, everybody would do it.

Why, how to vote

It's always easy to feel isolated from national and state politics
in Grinnell, and the 2006 midterm elections are Likely the last thing
on anyone’s mind this week. However, there will he a satellite vot-
ing station in the Forum South Lounge on Monday, and it remains
important that you take a moment out of your busy day to cast ii
ballot.

A vote for Leonard Boswell means giving Democrats control or
the U.S. House of Representatives, and thereby giving the phrase
“checks and balances" mcauing it's been sorely lacking. A vote for
Chet Culver anns preserving a woman's right [0 choose in Iowa,
which his opponent has already promised to oil. * am. And a vote
for Eric Palmer means furnlly raising town's minimum wage some»
thing that affects any of us who work to pay our tuition. Every onc
Ofthcsc candidates is locked in a ncckrandrncck battle to take back
Our country tor progressives, and every single vote will count,

Oiir clcctions often come down to ii couple hundred votes, and
the chrrblicans know it. Be on the lookout for attempts to suppress
Voting on Monday, no matter how subtle, For instance. negative ads
are designed more to discourage voters from going to the polls than
to change their mind By casting a ballot at satellite voting. you can
not only save progrc ive candidates the time and money it requires

,to counter these attacks,you can send Republicans aiountl the state

and the country the message that enough is enough.

You can both register to vote and cast a ballot at the satellite votr
irrg station from 9rr.m,umr14 p.m, in the Forum sooth Lounge on
Monday, Oct. 9. Lett take our country back then.

ASIA, redefined

Iwould like to clarify the misunderstanding that arose from the
article published by rhc sea; on ISO in the Sept,22.2ooo,issue.My
personal opinion in the article reﬂects my personal feelings regard
ing the matter and does not necessarily represent the organization
ofASlA as a whole, I personally believe that the my statement was
placed out ofcontcxt and misconstrued in it way that has been needs
lessly detrimental not only to me, but also to a student organization
that has worked nrduously to make ‘ difference on campus,

ASIA aims to reinvigorate its mission by hosting a series of ac
tivitics designed to involve the cnt‘rrc campus community, However,
we must understand that unless students makc full use of these opt
portunities by active participation and input, organizations such
as ASIA cannot function to best serve the interest of the campus
population or large, Admittedly, there needs to be increased dialogue
and interaction between both the international and domestic comp
munitics, Organi ations like ASIA have and will continue to SPOn’
sot events that promote cultural understandmg and awareness.
