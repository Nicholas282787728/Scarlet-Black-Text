Iowa Press Association;
Committees Named,

"Fight, prominence, novelty, and
suspense, are the qualities that make
a frontrpage story,” said Basil L wal-
1er, assisting managing editor of the
Des Moines Tribune—Capital, speaking
at the atternoon session of the press
association. Mr. Walter's speech,
“Writing the News," followed an ad-
dress of welcome made to the dele—
gates by President J. H. T. Main,

He also emphasized the high ideals
and ethics required for the newspa-
per man. Editorially, he declared, the
modern newspaper has not lived up
to the progress of the rest of the
world. Within the next ten years the
modern newspaper will have its great
opportunity for realization.

Batten Gives )[eet’s History

Mr. Walter's talk was followed by
an address by John R,>Batten, city
editor of the Cedar Rapids Gazette.
air, Batten, who was one of the five
college editors to found the Iowa Col-
lege Press association, spoke briefly
of its history. In February, 1917, the
editors of the Grinncll, Drake, Coe,
Cornell, and lows State college pub—
lications. met in the Y. M, C. A. in
Marshalltown and laid the founda—
tions for such an organization. The
first convention was held that year
at Colfax, with one hundred newspa»
permen present. Since that time con~
ventlons have been held annually,
with an ever increasing membership
and attendance.

“Journalism Nat Cut and Dried

Mr. Batten went on to speak oi the
qualities newspaper work demands in
the college graduate applying for a
job. “Too many people.” he said,
“have the idea that working on a
newspaper is just a lark, a romantic,
thrilling adventure, or mey go at it
with the TH try anything once' at
litude. Neither oi these get at man
anywhere in journalism, Nor is work-
ing on a newspaper just a step to
writing on a magazine or writing rlc<
tion, as many young people are en—
couraged to think.

"If a man wants a cut and dried
joh, he must stay off a newspaper."
he said, The newspaper man must be
prepared for evening assignments at
least two or three times a week, he
must constantly be on the lookout
for news; and in case of disaster, or
an extra story. the whole start, no
matter what their position. must be
readv to pitch in and help, regardless
of cat or sleep.

Petersiln Gives Advice

Mn Batten was followed by \Vil-
bur lPetersoo, sports writer on the
Associated Press stall at Des Moincs,
who spoke on “Sports VVriLing.” Mr.
Peteron described the pressure under
which sports writers of large city
dailies work, especially in football
season when two or three big games,
and five or Six lesser ones, are all
coming in at the same time. He spoke
of the necessity for accuracy and con-
densation in the sports story, saying
that the same rules applying to reg‘
ular news stories held good in its
case, although not quite so rigidly,
The sports writer is at liberty to
speculate as much on the outcome of
a contest as he wishes.

‘Committec Appointed

Following this address. the dele~
gates were dismissed to attend round
table discussions. The following cam~
rnittees were appointed by Howard

Chapel Services
Shifted to Eight

Main Announces

Beginning post Monday, chapcl will
he held at eight o'clock instead of ten
o'clock, according to an announcc-
ment made by Pi-e dent Main at
chapel yesterday morning.

Chapel hour will be changed from
ten to eight, President Main said,
since when campus activities so fully
occupy- the time of ninety per cent
of the student body, it is impractical
for the chapel service, which necessi-
tates closing the Library and class
rooms to break into the best part of
the morning hours. Therefore, chapel
will be held at eight o’clock instead
of ten: the first morning class at
8:20 instead of 8:00: and the regular
9.00 classes at 9:20.

Somers’ Steps Light

Betty Hovey Central Figure of
“Soaring,” Ceniéidwn Dance; '
Uses Large Scarf.

By Helen Kingery.

In a recital of interpretive and
character danccsfgiven 1T day night
in the high school auditorium, under
the direction of Miss Clara J. Ander-
son, the members of the women's
dancing classes seemed to have
caught for the most part an artistic
spirit transcending the classroom.
This was especially to be seen in the
[W0 longer and more sustained num-
bers that ended the program, an Evee
ning Fantasy, an interpretation of
Beethoven's reflections while playing
the moonlight sonata, and the Awak-
ening of the Statue, in which the
statuesque grouping of Lorado Taltt's
fountain in Chicago was held mouonr
less for a remarkable length of time.

Present “Life of it Leaf”

“The Life of a Lear," the victory
over winter, the joy of spring and
summer. and the death of the leaf,
danced by Grace Somers, began the
evening with one ol its most delicate
and expressive interpretations, as
she swirled in the joyous abandon of
autumn, and was at last swept help-
lessly away to the ground. Rondo
f‘appl'lcoso was a natural winding in
and out of six girls dressed as
Greek maidens, followed by success-
ive interpretation of sea songs by
Josephine Orr, as wind, waves, mer:
maid, snndpiper, seagull, and sea-
foam. "Soaring," a Denishawn dance,
was the triumph of the interpretive
dances, as five girls, with Betty Hovey
as a central figure, lifted and lowered
a large white scarf six yards souarc,
which, lyin‘g under lighting effects,
rippled like waves. or, when caught
up and carried, billowed out like a
soil.

“The Begging Gypsy," danced by
Vera Sterner in the program of char—
acter dances, had in it all the dash
and colorful beauty or her gay cos~
tume, and with her characteristic
magnetism or interpretation drew one
of the. warmest applauses from the
audience. ‘

The most amusing characterization
was by Elizabeth Webster, as hag-

Mayo Presents True but Biased

“It is true,“ said Miss Lillian Pick—

Miss Picken states that the lgnore

confinement for a year, to stiffer for

dia, it is believed that something the
wile has done in her present or a
previous life has caused her hus-

she is turned from her husband's

these widows (of whom there are
twenty thousand under five years or

who agreed to marry widows. But, a
man who does marry one of these
women is ostracized by his tamily,
who will not so much as eat with him
thereafter. So the organization suc-
ceeded very slowly—in twenty years
only thirty widows were married.

But, realizing the need for educat-

from the city in which he taught.
Dally, when his teaching in the city
was done. he would instruct the five
widows whom he had resolved to

By the wily of tuning up for today's
contest with Notre name, the Grin-
nell tennis team yesterday Scored a
2 to 1 Victory over the Oklahoma Ag-
gies due largely to the efforts of Cage
geshall who was playing in great
form. His sweeping singles victory

ton, 6-0, 6-4.

A five man match is on the pro»
gram against Notre Dame today. Bob
DeLong has been selected as the fifth

of his 5.3, 6-3 defeat of Charles Fall,
the other contender, yesterday. The

than the local aggregation and it may
stand them in good stead. The Grin-

son, however, and with Stowe slashing
the sphere in his usual style today
it should be a victory.

McKee, Taylor

Stars Yesterday

It was just after the Ion-yard dash,
the opening eevnt of the Friday track
program had been clicked into his-
tory with a clean sweep for Grinc
hell that local fans decided that the
Carleton track meet was to be a Grin-
nell victory. The final count was Grin-
ihlo. Carleton 511/2.

Although it was a cold day, pro—
hibitive of fast running and the out-
standing track and field records re-
mained calm and unafraid beneath
the covers of the record books, it
was nevertheless a speedy meet in
spots and bad enough competition to
keep the onlookel- guessing.

Taylor wins Hundred

Carleton had everything its own
way in the distances. scoring slams

‘ in/the mile and half mile. Secor, Grin-

nell sophomore, stepped out in the
two mile, however, and forced Severe
son to do his best to take the race
for the earls,

Coach Duke's bag of surprises was
only too good when Taylor took the
Inoeyard event and McKee copped secs
onii. Mcitee took first in the 220-yard
dash also and, even though neither he
nor Taylor competed in the quarter-
mile, Grinnellvtuuk first and second
thanks to Mark and Pelletier.

Kilknlit‘ll Takes Shot

McCully brought the field competir
tion average up for Grinnell by hoist—
ing his lengthy frame over the high
jump bar at 5 feet Ii inches and Mur-
ray and Kliltoliell tossed the dope
bucket far and accurately when they-
copped the top places in the discus
and shot put respectively. Ingram
heaved the javelin 167 feet 11 inches
to take that event.

Taylor, even though he did not
compete in the broad jump or the
quarter-mile, was high point man with
15 points to his individual record to
say nothing of his taking his turn
with the winning mile relay team.
Gossard of Carleton was second high
man at the meet with 10 points, He
took the broad jump, second in the
high hurdles, third in the shot put
and third in the discus. Taylor won
his points with firsts in both the high
and low hurdles and in the loﬂryard
ditsh.
