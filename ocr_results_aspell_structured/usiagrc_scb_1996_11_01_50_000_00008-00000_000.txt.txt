road to MWC title
Team deﬁnitely a force to be

reckoned with
By SETH KLEIMAN

Sports Information

After posting three more victories
this past week, the Grinnell College
women’s soccer team has extended
its winning streak to six in a row and
clearly demonstrated that they are a
force to be reckoned with as they
head to Lake Forest this weekend
to battle it out for the Midwest Cone
ference title.

The kickers-who clinched the
southern division and closed out
their regular season 11-4 overall and
10-0 in the conference. have only
two matches left on the road to be-
coming MWC champions for the
fifth time in seven years. Saturday
they will face defending champ St.
Norbert in the single-elimination
tournament. If victorious, they will
battle the winner of the Lake For-
est-Coe matchup in the champion-
ship game Sunday.

“We have been playing with a lot
of confidence and have been taking
Steps to improve every time we
play," remarked Coach Jenny Wood.

“1 know that we will be strong be»
cause we have shown that we be-
lieve in our philosophy and our tac-
tics. Wejust want to keep reacting
and adjusting one game at a time.”

Last week the Pioneers seemed ex-
tremely adjusted as they knocked
off all three oftheir opponents with
determination and poise. “I was
very happy with our performances,"
commented Wood. "We played well
throughout the break and I feel that
these matches were beneficial in
helping us prepare for the tournar
merit.” Sally Goodspeed ‘98 scored
the winning goal in the 1-0 Pioneer
win over Illinois Wesleyan. Kendra
Potz ‘97 and Molly Moilanen ‘97
each netted a goal in the 2.0 victory
against Monmouth. And Jill
Paulson ‘98 and For: each scored
to shut down Augsburg, 2-1.

The Pioneers are hoping to con-
tinue their positive play this week»
end in the conference tournament.
“This has been a tremendously ex-
citing and positive season.” Wood
stated. “We just need to remain
composed, focused, and continueto
play well and we will be ﬁne.“

Soccer men stage exciting
comeback against Coe

By ERIC RIENSCHE

Sports Information

In order to secure second place in
the MWC south division and secure
a berth in the conference champion-
ship toumament, the Grinnell Col-
lege men‘s soccer team desperately
needed a victory over Coe last Sat-
urday. The Pioneer's prospecs for
victory were not good as they were
fresh off a pair of non-conference
losses. Indeed, all appeared lost
when Coe jumped out to an early 3-
0 lead. But Grinnell‘s captains
sparked an astonishing comeback,
leading the team to a 5-3 win and a
chance at the crown.

Coe had a 6—1-1 conference record
heading into a game against
Monmouth. Grinnell was 63 in
coference play with only the Coe
game remaining. The only hope for
Coach John Pﬁtsch’s squad to reach

the playoffs was for Monmouth to
beat Coe and for his own team to beat
Coe the following week. Setting the
stage for the final showdown,
Monmouth defeated Coe in over»
time. Thus, the playoff race boiled
down to the confrontation between
the two teams vying for second place
in the south division. The winner
would go to the playoffs; the loser
would go home.

With the wind at their backs in the
ﬁrst half, Coe was able to punch in
three early goals to take a command-
ing lead in the ﬁrst half. But the Pio-
neers, led by senior captains Ryan
McGary and Chad Stewan, rallied
late in the half. Assisted by Stewart,
McGary headed in two goals to close
the gap at the intermission, 3-2. “We
got a tremendous performance from
our captains,“ lauded Coach Pﬁtsch.
“Those two goals in the first half
were the key to the game."

In the second half the Pioneers ems
ployed a full press and exploited the
wind advantage for three unan—
swered goals. McGary and Stewart
again connected early in the half, this
time with Stewart scoring and
McGary assisting, to knot the score.
Shortly thereafter sophomore Will-
iam Lee-Ashley knocked in the go-
ahead goal. Junior Dimiter Georgiev
iced the game with a goal late in the
half to secure the amazing 5-3 comes
back victory.

The single»elimination conference
tournament begins Saturday morning
at Knox. Grinnell faces Lake For»
est, the undefeated No. 1 seed in the
north division. "We are going for the
big upset," remarked Coach Pﬁtsch.
“I like the position we are in right
now. We are deﬁnitely the under-
dogs, but if we can get by Lake For-
est, I like our chances in the champi-
onship game."

Do we have to wait another
70 years to realize our ignorance?

Racism is "one’s affirmation of or acquiescence to or lack of recognition
of the structures and mechanisms of the racial state; one’s lack to
awareness of or blindness or indifference to one’s being racialized; one’s
affirmation of, indifference or blindness to the harm that the racial state
inflicts on some of its members" (Lugones from Making Face, Making

Soul; 1990, p 48-49).

We the members of Concerned Black Students found the ad which
appeared in the Gum on October 15 to be offensive and racist.

We feel like this: "For those of you who are tired of hearing about racism,
image how much more tired we are of constantly experiencing it, second
by literal second how much more exhausted we are to see it constantly

in your eyes..

This is not a guilt trip. Its a fact trip. The assessment of

what’s actually going on" (Smith from Making Face, Making Soul, 1990, p

25).

We encourage the entire campus community to talk about the issues of
race and racism beginning with the discussion which will take place next

week.

Thank you.

Gridders rout Monmouth 42- 13

Linemen were the key to victory says Coach

Wallace
By ERIC RIENSCHE

Sports Information

Heading into the ﬁnal game of the
season at Illinois College, the Grinnell
College football team is poised to ﬁn-
ish off the season with a ﬂurry of vic-
torles. After routing Monmouth at
home last Saturday, the Pioneers (3-5.
2-4) have the opportunity to finish
third in the MWC south division stand-
ings. But to attain that goal, they will
have to get past a potent Illinois Cole
lege team. “It is going to be tough to
win on that ﬁeld,“ remarked Coach
Greg Wallace. ”Not only does Illinois
College have an excellent squad, they
will also have a deﬁnite home ﬁeld
advantage."

While the Blue Boys hold home ﬁeld
advantage, the Pioneers almost cer—
tainly have the edge in conﬁdence af-
ter soundly defeating Monmouth, 42-
13, According the Coach Wallace, the
team is just now starting to peak. “It
was nice to see us put together a com-
plete game both offensively and de-
fensively,” said Wallace. “We played
the full 60 minutes and we got great
results."

The game shined out auspiciously for
Grinnell as Sean Cotten completed two
ﬁrst-quarter touchdown passes. The
ﬁrst was a 73»yarder to sophomore
ﬂanker Richard Werner and the sec-
ond was a9ryard completion to senior
Kafele Hodari. Latera touchdown run
by Monmouth made the score 14-7 af»
ter one quarter. Early in the second
quarter Cotten once again found
Hodari, this time for a one—yard touch
down strike. Late that same qaurter,

junior fullback Jim Hart, who ﬁnished
wIth 171 yards on 26 carries, punched
in from a yard out. Monmouth rallied
to score again but at the half the Ploy
ncers held a comfortable 28713 lead.
The Pioneers protected their lead well
in the second half with a 37ryard
touchdown run by Hart and a final
scoring strike through the air from
Cotten to Werner to ice the game.
Although the skill players cleary ex»
celled in the game, Coach Wallace
singled out the linemen as the team's
most valuable assets. “We dominated
up front on both sides of the ball,”
noted Wallace. “The guys in the

trenches deserve a lot of credit." Of-
fensive linemen include Mark
Tmcinskt ‘99, Marcos Ortega ‘97, JE-
son Paulin ‘98. Mark Hund ‘98 and
Michael Fischer ‘98. On the defen-
sivc line Keven Oulds ‘97, Josh
Waddcll ‘97, Paul Nelson ‘97 and
Kevin Humision ‘97 all made their.
presence felt.

In this week's game (mach Wallace
hopes to see the same type of effort
displayed against Monmouth. “If we
play physically up front and hold down
our tumovers like we did Saturday, we
should be in good shape against Illi-
nois College," said Wallace.
