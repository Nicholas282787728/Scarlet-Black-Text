A. S Ennis Superintended Many
| Crews of carpenters and
Other Repair Men.

Considerable work has been done
and some expense has boon incurred
during the summer in improvements
around the campus. according to l.
s, Ennis, superintendent or buildings
and grounds. ,

One oi the largest and most im—
portant undertakings was the estab—
lishing or a Blackburnsinith water
filter at an exilellse or $1 200 for la»
hor and matciial, Th machine
iiltcrs all of tlle water as it is taken
irolo the oily main, and is capable of
littering 150,000 gallons or water per
haul:

' huprove Plumbing.

The hot water scrrice at the mens
dormitories has been centralized. This
improvement was made at the quad-
rangle two years ago. Each hall in
the domrtorics tormerly had its own
heating cell‘s, and the system was pips
ed lrom the beating plant, but
water will he heated at the plant and
piped to the doruutiorlcs This means
that all of tho huildip . will have hot
water, at all times.

Steam healing is being installed at
‘he College club and the Mary Chain—
oerlalu home at an ‘expensc of $2,000.
This will make the healing arrangc.
ments of these two houses a great
‘eal more satisfactory.

Another nuproremoui. uhioh will
prove very desildble is tho ccmcntmg
or the iloprs or Blair Hall. This old
building is being grratlr lllmlel'lilzell
by the repairs. l

Dorms Ill-decor d. _

The men's balls look like new after

having Survived a complete rcdecorah
mg. According to Mr. Ennis scvcuteeal
barrels at point have been usod to'
brighten the living quarters oi the
men.
Not a tree on the campus has been
touchcd this summer. This may seem.
rather unusual, lor in former year
one of the most noticeable imprcvc-
ments has been the clearing out or,
changing or somc of thc numerous
trees on the campus.

dents, prior to ,the taking in 'or new
