Sophomores Battle for Backfield
in Pre-Season Gridiron Workouts

Nine Pioneers Drill Hard
to Keep Positions

on First Team

By KENNETH CLAYTON

While the coaches have been
watching the work of all candidates
with critical eyes, the battle of Sopho-
mores for a halfback position on the
Crinnell college eleven has provided
the major feature of the practice
sessions of the Pioneer gridmen,
which have been under way since
Sept. 10. Since Claude Richey is not
returning to college. there remains
an open placc in the backﬁeld which
seems to be the center of attraction
for new candidates.

Coach L. L. “Fuzz" Watt is going
through the program this year with
nine veterans. The letter men back
are Minicr and Bilto, ends; Humphrey
and Walker, tackles; Bradford,
guard; Christcffersen, center; Thom—
as, quarterback; Ruff, halfback, and
Capt. Ben Douglas, fullback.

Backﬁcld Shows Form

The three veterans of the back-
ﬁeld are showing last Season‘s form.
Douglas sporting somc addildflnal

'weight and plenty of drive. “Snap”
James and Dick Ullricb are making
a strong bid for the fourth place
back of the line, and MoCrcsry, Alcx-
antler, and Pojman are showing class
that makes them worth watching.

James is doing his best work as a.
broken field runner and a passer,
wblle Ullricb is primarily a line dri-
ver and kicker. With Thomas and
Douglas as punters, and Thomas and
Ruff as passers, the mentor should
develop a well rounded backﬁeld ag-
gregation this year. "Fritz” G‘raﬁund,
sophomore heavyweight, is serving
as understudy for Ben Douglas at
the fullback position.

Golz Comes Back

Minier and Bilto are both up to
shape at the wings, while Murphy
and Edmans, both juniors who Saw
action in' some of the games in 1029.
are back with more weight and plan-
ty of speed. Murphy has been Show»
ing plenty of class going down under
punts. Another end candidatc who
will make the veterans look to their
laurcls is Otto Golz, a junior who
played in several games of the 1928
campaign, but who was not in col-
lege last year. An injured arm kcpt
him from further honors in 1928.

Addition of Iowa Wesleyan to Schedule Provides
Four Games Under Ward Field Lights I

BY JOHN CANNING
(Editor, The Scarlet. and Black)
(Copyright, 1930, by The Grinnell Scarlet and Black)

Night 10010011 [or Gl'illllk‘ll, advocated last spring by the college
lltllll‘llu department and editorially by 'Tllo Scarlet and Black,
changed l'l'olll 7| dream to a reality this summer with the installation
0f 16 pro' ’lOl‘S on Word Field.

Following Scarlet. and Black editorials for night football in March and
April, Grinnell college authorities decided definitely the middle of May to
equip Ward field with lights. Bids were invited and on July 15 a contract
was entered into with Cahill Brothers of New York City, the first
company to manufacture floodlight for‘ night football and one of the three
concerns bidding on the Ward field project, to erect projectors on the local‘
gridiron. E. c. Lytton, business manager of Drake university, is Iowa state
manager for the company.

It is estimated that the equipment now erected on Word field will cost
$3,000 when finished. Night football at the four other colleges of the Vale
ley conference averaged 33,500. Creighton and Drake spent that amount,
while Oklahoma used $3,850 and Washington $5,000.

morning, the men in A.R.H. at 8:30 a

o'clock and the women in the quad-
rangle theater at the same time. At
9:30 o'clock they will meet togeth—
er in the recitation building. After
luncheon the new man, whose names
begin with letters A to L, will meet
in the men's gymnasium and the
first all college dance will be held in
the evening.

The Saturday program will open
with the meeting of new men, whose
names begin with the letters M to z.
in the men's gymnasium. There will

Outside Work

Invites Frosh

Talents Used in High School
Welcomed lay Activities

on Campus

By HELEN KlNGERY

Freshmen who have participated in
outside activities as high school stu-
dents will iind no lack of demand for
their talents in Crinnell,

In past years many desirable
places on the campus have been ﬁlled
by freshmen. Athletic, dramatic,
journalistic. and musical activities
welcome interested freshmen whom
they my train as future leaders,
while the majority of organizations
on the campus welcome freshmen to
membership.

Athletics as always will claim a
maximum of attention. A freshman
football squad is chosen each year
and trained as varsity material, of-
ten engaging in skirmishes with the
varsity or other freshman teams. A
freshman basketball team is also a
goal for all cage aspirants, whilc
freshman track and cross country
teams are also maintained. In addi-

Four Games Here

A total of 43,000 watts will illuminate the Crinnell field for the four
night football games schedulcd at home this season. Twelve poles, six on
each the east and west sides of Ward field, have been erected. The projec<
tors carry two 1,500 watt bulbs apiece, two of the projectors being on each
of the four corner poles and one on each of the remaining 12.

As at other Missouri Valley conference schools, the increase in gate re.
ceipts is expected to pay for the lighting fixtures. General admission to
regular afternoon football games in th past has been 31, with $1.50 charged
for reserved seats. The same prices will remain for the night contests, but
the regular seating accommodations of 2,000 will be enlarged to 4,000, which
heretofore has been provided principally at Homecoming games.

Average attendance at afternoon Grinncll football games has been 1,300,
as given out by the athletic department, and 2,500 at the Homecoming at-
tractions. It is expected that the average crowd for regular games, now to
be played at night, will be doubled, or 2,600, and that Homecoming frays
will‘fill Ward field with a capacity crowd of 4,000.

The Creighton-Grinnell game, which will be the Homecoming contest,
and will be played on Ward field Friday night, Oct. 31, is the only one of
the four home tilts which requires reserved seats this year. In return for
semester fee coupons, college students will be given tickets for reserved seats
in a special student section.

100 Per Cent in Valley

With Grinnell’s purchase of projectors, which made the playing of night
football 100 per cent in the Missouri Valley conference, Cahill Brothers have
supplied the equipment for lighting the gridlrons of every college in the
conference except Creighton. They also sold the lights that stand on
Yankee field in New York City and Soldiers' field in Chicago,

Although the lights on Word field soon will be used for several workouts
of coach Lester Watt's proteges, Grinnell's first game of night football will
not be played until a week from Saturday night. Originally it was announced
that three games out of seven booked this fall would be played
here Friday nights, but a Special home opener with the Tiger eleven of Iowa
Wesleyan vcollege at Mount Pleasant, champion last year of the Iowa con
ference, has been carded for Saturday night. Sept. 27. as given out to The
Scarlet and Black by John C. Truesdale, director of Crinnell athletics, this
afternoon.

Through cooperation of the Crinnell chamber of commerce and the col-
lege, a special ticket drive has been launched for the Iowa Wesleyan game,
which is expected to rank near the top of the Pioneers revised schedule as
a tough encounter. A four page advertisement, announcing the Iowa Wes-
leyan-Crinnell night football game and the fall opening of Grinnell mer-
chants, which will be held next weekend, will be mailed to the families com-
prising the Grihncll trade area.

Pioneers Play Weekly

By bringing the four page sheet to one of the advertisers, a family will
receive tickets for each member, which in turn will be good with 25 cents
apiece for admission to Crinnell's inauguration of night football a week
from Saturday. = The radius of the patronage for local night football games
is expected to extend as far as Des Moioes. Many Crinnell merchants will
close the night of Sept. 27 during the Wesleyan-Grinnell battle, and the usual
Saturday night closing hour of 10 will be moved to 11 in some cases.

After the game here next week, the Pioneers play every week through
to the final tussle with Iowa State Teachers here Nov. 21. Marquette, De-
troit, Drake, Carleton, Creighton, Washington, and Cornell will encounter
Crinnell in addition to State Teachers, The Carleton game at Nortbfield is
the only one not booked for night, but recent correspondence with the Gri .
nell athletic office has revealed that the Csrls are interested in the "owl"
sport, and may yet install projectors for night football this season.

Installation of lights on Ward field has met the approval of officials of
middlewest universities and all conference institutions. The following opin-
ions on GTinnell'S night football were gathered by The Scarlet and Black:

Creighton—A. A. Sclmbillger, director of athletic I was pleased to
learn that the Grinnell college Pioneers have joined us in presenting night
football to the publi thereby enabling all to enjoy the great college game.
In my opinion, the night game is much more colorful and interesting to the
spectator, as well as more popular with the players and coaches. I cou-
gratulﬂe The Scarlet and Black on supporting the progressive policies of
G'finnell‘s fine athletic staff in its editorial campaign for this feature.

Grinnellians Give Opinions
Dmko—Ossic Salem, football coach: I want to congratulate Grinnell
upon its alertness in falling in line with the trend of progress. Night foot—
ball is here to stay. Experience has proven that it is practical, not only
from tho playing standpoint, but from the viewpoint of the spcctator. The
progressive and alert schools are already adopting it, and it is good to know
that Grinnell is wasting no further time in falling in line. We wish you suc-
cess in this innovation.
Grinucll—mstcr Dukc, trnck conch: That athletic contests may be staged
successfully under artificial nights has been proven conclusively. During
