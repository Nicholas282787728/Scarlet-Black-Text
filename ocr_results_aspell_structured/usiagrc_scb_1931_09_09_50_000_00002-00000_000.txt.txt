BACK TO OLD GRINNELL

Tllis greeting is nlcant not for returning up-
perclasslnen, but for freshmen. For one does not
think of freshmen as entirely new, Your iutcrcst
in Grinnell, your study of the material sent to you,
and of the Good News, your acquaintance with
older Grinlicllians, and your desire to come here
yourselves have already made you parts of the
Grinnell family.

Feel that you are coming back. Fccl that you
are returning to the friends you made on brief
visits here, and the friends you know through soc-
illg their pictures and reading their names.

For our part, we are glad to see you, all again,
and we are glad you are going to be here for four
years. If you feel a bit lonely now, it isn‘t a hit
more than every alumnus feels when he comes
back after graduation and you welcome him to
your campus. Here’s to a pleasant year for all.

N0 BALLYHOO NOW

Grinnell students and alumni are probably
more skeptical over the Pioneer outlook on the
gridiron this season than at any time for the last
three years. They realize that Coach L, L, Watt
will have his hands full in ﬁnding material to fill
the gaps left in the line by graduation.

To the casual sporting world, however, Grill-
nell’s prospects rank about the same as usual.
Every coach is pessimistic as the season starts. A
resent syndicated story pointed out that coaches
ﬁnd such a policy proﬁtable for it keeps followers
of the eleven from expecting better results than
the team can produce.

The continual “hear” stories that early season
brings out work an additional hardship on the
coach who really does have to rebuild a large part
of his team, however for his lamentations are
taken by many rcaflcls to be only a part of the
gridiron hallyhoo. If his team does win an unusual
share of its games and presents an exceptionally
good brand of football it seems to be only what
was expected. The sporting public becomes cere
tain that preseason Stories of poor prospects were
only for publicity purposes

The graduation of Grinncll’s old guard has
torn a huge holc ill Grinnell athletics, not only on
the gridiron, but in basketball and track as well.
Ruff, Douglas, Humphrey, Minier, Hensley, and
Walker are only a few of the sports performers

RUNNING A NEWSPAPER

(From the Perry Free Press)

The thing that makes it hard for a person to run
a newspaper is his friends. When a friend thinks some-
thing ought to be kept out of the paper he doesn’t
hesitate to ask it as a personal favor. An enemy doesn't
ask any favors. But a friend thinks the conduct of a
neurspaper is the personal matter of the editor, when
as a matter of fact be is largely in the position of a
man serving a public trust.

A philosophical old fellow once said to the writer,
"A newspaper that doesn’t make you mad once in a
while isn't worth the subscription price."

To make people mad isn’t the chief province of a
newspaper, but if it's going to be one worthy of the
name, it must print the news without fear or favor. This
paper has been threatened with, and-indeed has Suffered
business reprisals, not once, but frequently. These things
mu‘st necessarily be borne in silence. The great reading
public which a newspaper selves‘is not interested in
the personal difﬁculties of the editor or publisher,
though we have known instances which a full airing
of threats and subsequent reprisals would have made
absorbing reading,

But such things must be regarded as part of the
gameito be suffered perhaps because of sins committed
in other directions. And then, too, it must be remem-
bered that all things both human and divine, are sub-
ject to criticism. Even the Bible does not escape.

BOOST SMALL TOWN
(From the Linotype News)

That the small town is a good place for the am—
bitious young man who wants to do things for him-
self aod others, and that the small town newspaper
offers a real opportunity in journalism, were convic—
tions expressed by Sherwood Anderson, internationally
known author and,sman town publisher, in a talk at
Northwestern university.

About three years ago Mr. Anderson bought two
weeklles in Marion, Va.—the'Marion Democrat and the
Smythe County News. He himself is the publisher of
both papersian active publisher. His son, Robert Lane
Anderson, is the editor. And both of them have been
having the times of their lives in small town journalism.

"At the outset of his newspaper career, Mr, Ander-
son did all the work himself, even to collecting the ad-
vertisemen runs an editorial in a recent issue of
the Rotarian. "As he mingled with his fellow townsmen,
he caught their point of view and learned to know their
needs. He hung artistic pictures on his ofﬁce walls and
made the newspaper shop a cheery place for groups to
congregate. Acting on his suggestion, is lot used as a
village 'dump’ was transformed into a place of greenery
and happy recreation. Citizens named the park Sher-
wood Park in token of their appreciation of this stran-
ger who showed them in what favored surroundings
they lived and worked.

"So successful and invigorating has been his news-
paper venture that Mr. Anderson is emboldened to urge
talented young men and women to turn their backs
on the big cities and to stay by the small towns Where
their energies and capabilities may have abundant op-
portunity to ﬂower and develop, and Where rewards are
not measured in bank balances, but genuine joy of
friendly associations and full orbed living.

"The preservation of that rich personal equation
in community lifesall but crowded out in the present
era of standardization—is a bottle well worth ﬁghting.
Mr, Anderson does well to indicate how success may
come to a man in any small ﬁeld he makes his own
by reason of his special gifts of personality, and his
own blend of enthusiasm, competence,, and good cheer.”
