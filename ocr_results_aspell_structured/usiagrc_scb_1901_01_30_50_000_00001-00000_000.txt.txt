Senior Club Entertained.

The senior Girl’s club spent a
very delightful time at the home
of Prof. and Mrs. Main last Satur-
day evening. Very iew members
of the club were obliged to be
absent and they feel that a real
treat was missed. After a time
passed in chatting, Mrs. Main dis-
tributed through the company a
large number of curios and tancy
articles each of which had a story
connected with it. Some pictures
of Prof. Main and his party taken
at different places on his journey
through Egypt and Palestine,
were of great interest to all pres
ent, showing, as they did, glimpses
of the life of the natives, mode oi
travel used there and places or
renown. The pleasant evening
last week awakened the memory
or the meeting of ambassadors
and their ladies which was held at
Proi. Main’s just about a year ago.
Those who were present on that
occasion can, in a measure, ape
preciate what a good tinie the
club had last Saturday night. At
a late hour the guests took their
departure. satisﬁed that at the
Main home is an ideal place to be
entertained.

The State Convention.

The present year marks the ﬁt-
tieth anniversary or the organiza-
tion of the Young Men’s Christian
Association in this country. In
honor of this event an exceptions
ally interesting program has been
arranged for the State Conten~
tion to be held at Burlington,
February 1417. The committee

well, and have been tortunate in
securing the attendance of many
of the strongest men in the Asso-
ciation movement. ‘

The most interesting feature of
theConvention will be the address-
es by John R. Mott, who is un-
doubtedly the most widely known
and most inﬂuential of all who are
engaged in Christian work among
the students of the world.

Among others, there appear on
the program, the names of Presir
dent MncLean, of the State Unis
vcrsity; I, E. Brown, for twenty
years the State Secretary oi Illi-
nois; E. L. Hamilton, railroad
Secretary, International Commit-
tee; Frank W.Ober. editor of"As-
sociatlon Men”; W. C. Brown,
General Manager ot the C.B.& Q,
R.R.;and many other noted work-
ers.

The special music for the cone
vention will be furnished by the
Ottumlvn Male Chor-
voices.

The Pentathlon Contest will be
held Monday, February 18th. By
a recent action of the committee,
the college associations are drop~
ped (mm the contest, As a result
the interest of the college men is
considerably lessened.

It is expected by those in
charge that this will be one of the
largest and best conventions the
associations in the state have ever
held, and every possible arranger
merit is being made for the come
tort and pleasure of the delegates.

Work of Calocagathian.

In its program for this year the
Caloca society has not tollowed
any deﬁnite scheme of work but
the programs have been left ens
tirely to the discretion of the pro-
gram committee. It is believed
that on the whole more satis-
iactory results are obtained in
this way than by having a set
plan otwork, in so much as the
aim of the society is to avoid
tedionsness ii possible, and
combine in some measure
creation with literary instruction,
With a long course of study, in-
latest is apt to lag and especially
is this trite ii a member is come
pelled to miss a session. But
while there is no unity in the pro-
grams of the term, as a whole
each program has a unity or

to
re

 

thought. As' far as students in
college at the present time can
certify this has always been the
plan or the society.

Last term the society had a
great diversity of programs. One
atternoon was spent in the dis»
cussion ot lbsen’s work and per
sonal history while another was
given over to a debate. Also con
siderable extemporaneous work,
which is considered especially
valuable, has been ailrled now and
then to the regular work. Once
during the fall ”The Institute,”
their brother society, joined forces
with the Caloca and a bright little
iarce was given alter which a
social time ensued. Also several
valuable book reviews have been
given and otten tableaux are pre-
pared to illustrate them. These
examples will show to some ex
tent the quality and value of the
work done. The membership
limit which 1550 is reached, and
there is an unusually large num-
ber upon the associate member
ship list showing the prosperous
condition of the society. With
this large attendance the pro
grams have succeeded in interest-
ing all, and also have succeeded
in placing almost all the members
upon the programs,

Birthday Party.

Monday evening, ﬁfteen young
ladies enjoyed the hospitality of
Miss Eva Peck at a banquet
which, it is sate to say, was never
surpassed in Grinnell. When the
guests had assembled they were
ushered into a room beautiful
with palms and cut ﬂowers. The
feature which elicited the greatest
interest was the long table, dainti-
ly decorated with terns and car-
nations and lighted with tapers.
The prevailing color was pink
which was carried out in the
quaint gown of the hostess.

After justice had been done to
the elegant (our course dinner, at-
tention was directed to Miss Par-
ker, the toast-mistress. who was
dressed as a colonial dame. The
following toasts were given: “An-
niversaries.” “Snow's Comer and
Lovers Lane," “To the Seniors,"
“From the Seniors,” "Her Birth-
day." The last toast was answered
by a clinking or glasses, to which
Miss Peck responded in, her
charming manner, After singing
a few favorite college songs, the
girls separated, only regretting
that such occasions are so rare.
