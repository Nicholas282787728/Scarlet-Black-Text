As a result, the Escort Service

Grinnell Women provide science
opportunies for female youth

The Saturday science program,
organized by the Grinnell College
Women in Sc1ence, began last week
with a bang, 0t at least, a steatly beat.
“The tirst week we did Biology," said
Mary Mader, Assistant Professor of
Chemistry at Grinnell, "and the real
kick was watching the hearts bear in
pithed frogs."

According to Mader, the pro«
gram, designed “specifically for girls
in the fifth and sixth grades, to help
them learn about the many Opportu»
titties open to them in scientiﬁc
study," consists of a series of tour
workshops dealing with six ditterent
areas of science: mathematics, com«
puter seierice, biology, chemistry,
physics and psychology. Funded by

the DonaldsonCorporation,thetwo
hour long workshops open to girls in
the Grinnell area are free orchargc
and include lunch at the end,

The Saturday Science Program
got its start three years ago when
many female science students at
Otlnnellexpressedconcernthatgirls
were losing interest in science. The
program was “completely student
initiated," remarked Mader. A total
ot thirty temale Grinnell students
volunteer to teach in the ptogtaini

“something we wanted to do is
show girls that people who mayor in
science are normal people too," said
Madeti “We'rett‘yingloptovidetole
models tor the girls." in order to do
this, according to Moder, the work
shops allow (or much intorinal inter.

which serves to give the girls a sense
