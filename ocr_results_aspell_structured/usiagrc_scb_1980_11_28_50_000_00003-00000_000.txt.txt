Three elections, no VP yet

by Tom tank

The first posters came in a barrage.
big and small, funny and serious. and
they were followed by an election which
only three survived. The second round
of posters was somewhat more sub-
dued. No remained in the race after
that election. The third round of posters
crept in quietly, wanting to be noticed,
but not wanting to be too obvious, A
third election was held, and still no win»
her emerged.

Because of the wording of the SGA
byrlaws, this series of three elections
has failed to produce an SGA vice-
president to replace John Conyers, who
resigned because of academic
pressures. The last election, a runoff
between Doug Rowe and Julia McCray,-
was close. and as Election Board Chair-
man Rob Schwartz comments, “The
Constitution requires that in a close
election writeun votes will just screw
things up.”

The actual wording of the Constitu-
tion is as follows: "A candidate must
receive more than 50 percent of the
total vote in order to win. If no can-
didate receives more than so percent of
the vote, a runoff shall occur." The
runoff election is to be held between the
minimum number of candidates whose
combined portion of the total vote is
over 50 percent

in the first runoff Rowe defeated Mc-
Cray and Carleton Knotts by a large
margin. but because of a close race for
second place, he failed to get a majority
of the votes. Rowe then narrowly
defeated McCray in the runoff election
held this past Tuesday. However,
because nearly 20 percent of the total
vote consisted of writevins. he was
unable to garner the needed majority.

Schwartz felt that the most important
reason for the large number of writeins
was that"people don't know the can-
didates. if you see a poster on a wall
with someone’s name on it, but you
don‘t know the person, it‘s just as easy
to write in Velcro Kitty or some other
silly thing," When asked if the large
number of write-ins could possibly ex-
press dissatisfaction with the can-

didates, he replied. ”If people are‘

dissatisfied, it's the campus's fault, No
one wanted issues during the cam
paign. The people running joke came
paigns did very well in the first elec-
tion."

There are several courses which
could be followed from this point, rang
ing from no more elections to. as SGA
Social Coordinator Chris Nylander put
it, "elections until hell freezes over." It
is possible that Rowe could take the
case before Judicial Council and ask
them to declare him the winner of the
election, however, at the time this issue

went to press he was still undecided
about doing so.

,Rowe's contention would be that,
since the candidates listed on the runoff
ballot are the only “legal" candidates
for the position, all other ballots cast
should be considered as null and not
counted as part of the total vote. This
would make the listed candidate with
the most Votes, Rowe in this case. the
winner of the election.

if this course were followed the
Judicial Council decision would pro-
bably not be made until the end of the
semester, If the contention was re-
jected, another runoff election would
have to be held next semester.

Also. should Rowe decide not to con
test the election, another runoff bets

,ween himself and McCray will be held.

SC—A President Paul Volker has sug-
gested that the ballots be prepared with
no space for writerins. He also feels that
the Election Boardi elf could disquali-
ty write-in votes, citing a section of the
election guidelines which he says states
that the Election Board has the power
to supplement the bylaws if they so
desire.

Schwartz disagrees with Volker on
this point. He felt that the extent of the
Election Board‘s power depends upon
how the Constitution is interpreted.
“The Board could possibly have this
power, but then again, others might see
it differently.” While not necessarily in
favor of such a move, he didn't feel that
it would be unfair. “After all, it’s easy
to get your name on the ballot. Besides,
people could still run a‘ write—in cam-
paign for the initial election."

Nylander sees a third way to solve the
problem. He pointed out that the elec

tion guidelines are part at the SGA by-
laws, and Joint Board can change the
bylaws if they vote to do so in two con-
sectutive meetings. Two emergency
meetings could even be called in one
day if it was necessary. However, he
doubted that this would be done. noting,
“Some people might be offended."
Volker considered the method to be too
roundabout and felt that it would be
“clearly subverting the intent of the by
laws"

Voter apathy has also begun to be a
problem, The number of people voting
in the election has dropped each time.
“People get sick of voting,” noted
Schwartz. “it seems that the only peo-

ple who don t get sick of voting are the i
ones writing joke ballots There were 30
percent more this last time than in the'
previous election.”

“I'm not against write-int. Votes.
Writein votes for qualified candidates ;
are fine,” Schwartz added. “The bad
thing is the joke votes. If people vote
that way they should accept what they
are saying about SGA and what it ,
means. The campus often complains

'that SGA IS a joke. If they want to be

different they shouldn’t treat it as a
joke. "

The continuing elections are also hav-
ing an effect upon the workings of the _
SGA cabinet. Nylander commented,
"Everybody in SGA would just as soon
get the elections over with so we had a
vicerpresiderit and could get back to
work.”

Should Rowe decide not to contest the
election, the next runoff will be held on
Tuesday, Dec. 2, at the post office. Col~
lege ID's will be required.
