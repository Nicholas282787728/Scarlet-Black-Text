Matmen Grapple Way

To Conference Titles
With wrestling in its second
postwar year here in Grinnell,
the Pioneer grapplers did very
well by themselves. Coached by
Hank Brown, the Grinnell team
entered all eight classes in the
conference meet here March 4-5, ,
and collected third places or bet-
ter in seven of the eight Weights
represented. But, going back to
the season itself, we note the
.following results.
Opening against
sho’rtly after Christmas, the .
Fiuneers were toppled 17-10.
Late in January, with Greg
sidelined by injuries. Colorado
University blanked the Grinnell
squad 3070, and a week later
Cornell repeated the feat, 2570.
At Carleton the Ploneers earned
their lirst victory, topping the
Carls 22-10. A week later when
Carleton repaid the visit the
Pioneer squad scored a 16712
win. in their final dualmcct of
the season, the Grinnell matinen ,
found Beloit a gracious host as
the Gold bowed, 21713, ‘
But in the loop meet here in
Darby it was a different story
as Grinnell made the only ser- .
to Cornell's title-
lhungi-y grapplers. Trailing the
champion Hilltoppers by eight
points With 35, the Pioneers had
:a 15 point lead over third place
lCarleton, while Ripon followed
‘Wlth 11 markers. Lawrence, Be-
loit, and Knox rollowcd in that
order. Outstanding in the meet
were heavyweight “Bud" Greg
and 175 pounder Dave TheophL
lus, who was competing in his

Both these Grinnell inatmen won i
their respective weights by pin»

Only Steve Irving, who was

finish in the money.

Track Team Takes Fourth

In Conference Meet

. Grinnell's track team, defend—

ing conference champions, didn’t

fare as well this year as they did

in the 194743 season. The Pie-

neei- cindermen won their dual

meets with Simpson and also
took a first in the Coe, Cornell,

and Grinnell Triangular meet. ,
But in their other outings they

weren't as successtiil. Coach

Berry and his outtit finished

fourth in the eonierenee meet

held at Lawrence as John Eon-

yata came through as the only i
first placer, winning the 11m and l
220 yard dashes. Glenn Saunders ‘
and Brett Taylor took seconds in

the broad jump and 330 yard

run, respectively while 13111

Smiley garnered a third in his

two mile specialty.
