GRINNELL AT Y

'A Freshman s Impression 'of Grin»
nell Is Subject

Waldo Gelvin, Nelson Whitehill, and
I William iloyer spoke at the YJIII. c, A.
meeting Thursday evening on “‘A
Freshman's Impression of Grinnell”.

Loren Border played the violin, ac
companied by Arthur Brandenburg.

Gelvin talked about the change
which takes place In the fl‘eshinallIs
life. During the ﬁrst year of eolle'ge

life the freshman literally gains about

ﬁve years in experience through the
constant association with the older fel
lows, and with men oi more Intellect-
ual experience. In this period he un-
dergoes a change in most of his ideas

concerning life, and It is irnportanil

That he should associate with the right
unpcrclassmen.
thiLellill spoke more flom the no ‘
sonal side of ,the question and told
something or his early difﬁculties,
which brought memories to the old
men. “I like Gi'lnnell,” he said, "be-
cause you make your own good time
Instead of the artiﬁcial good times of
the larger schools, and because in
Crinnell a man does not need to spend
the money which university life de-
lnands."
iioyer said that he had been impres<
sell with the seriousness of purpose
of the Students in Gllnnell. He also
Spoke oi the associations of college lifa
and of the desire which LhEY had
brought him [or more friends and
_ greater knowledge.

Intense situation there, The speaker

Mr. Hornbeck emphasized the fact
that China had more people, more ter—

natural resources than any other nag

two struggles in the Far East, that be.‘

that inside the orient itself. Japan
made itself the dominating powersin
Asia. and had all Asiatic nations al-
,most at its command, and was not
loath to exercise its power. It took
the policy or "orient for Orientals"
which was called by some the Monroe
doctrine of the Far East, but accord-

wrongly called this because it was
