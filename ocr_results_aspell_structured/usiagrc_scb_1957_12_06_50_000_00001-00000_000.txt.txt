0n North Campus
Arouses Yea, Nay

By Bill Kell
Prepping is over —— swat-
ting, costume day, hell night,
buttoning —- all these are
now impressions in the minds
of those who took part.

This week, the S&B circu-
lated questionnaires in an ate
tempt to tabulate these im-
pressions. 160 were returned.

Although north campus
presents a wide divergence
0" opinion on this year‘s
prepping program, the halls
tend to agree as units. This
would seem 'to indicate that
some halls presented a more ef-
fective program than others and
that the rules set down by the
CofHP lent themselves to in-
dividual interpretation.

study, Sleep Loss
The freshmen almost unani-
mously agreed that prepping
was not too severe, but 19 out
of '78 thought it detrimental for
various reasons, the most popu-
tar lbeing “loss of sleep.”
Prepping did have an effect
on study time: 59 of the 7S
frost: indicated that some study
time was lost during prepping.
Approximately one-third of
each hall felt that there was a
desirable attitude toward the
program, The prevalent criticism
was that the program empha—
sized too much humiliation of
the prep and suggested that
more constructive phases 'be in-
stituted. Many questionnaires
mentioned the benefits of prep
ping in relation to the hall, lbut
few enumerated the merits in
relation to the whole school.

"ncgnouug, Perverse"

Over 95 percent of those who
returned questionnaires advo-
cated having a prepping pro-
gram. When asked for opinions
on prepping, a Rawson freshman
said, ‘fFor one individual to ap~
point himself the superior of an-
other simply because he arrived
on Grinnell’s campus a year or
two before is absurd. The pro-
gram is time-consuming, fa-
tiguing, degrading, embarrasing,
humiliating, and times sadistic
and perverse. What rationality
lies hehind' an individual being
forced to bow, 'be beaten, and
respect every mad whim of an-
other individual?"

A Cowles frosh commented:
“Prepping definitely did not ful-
fill the ﬂowery statements of
goals and objectives for which
it supposedly was intended.
Prepping to me seems a ritual-
istic event performed to carry on
‘tradition’—Whatever that is."

Clarification Requests

One question which receiv-
ed an almost unanimous reply
Was “Should swatting be part
of the program?" About 95%
of the north campus, preps
and upperolassmeu, answered
“Yes.” But many requested a
clarification of the C of HP
rule on “swatting” which fails
to define the term or its ap-
plication outside of shitting that
it may be carried on. One
Cowles freshman answered
“Dellnitely” and continued,
“As you can see I’m no longer
a prop so am now in favor of
use program. (Revenge on next
year's preps)” Swavﬂng's
merit was mainly described] as
an ”impetus" or “incentive”
for coercing preps into doing
“constructive" things.

for the Christmas formal. .The

Victor. The present group has
possession of Miller’s entire
music library and uses his ar-
rangements.

:Ten years after Miller was
killed during World War II, a

movie of his life sparked a re-
vival of Miller music. At this
time, McKinley, who had work~
ed with the orchestra leader in
the '30’s and later during the
war, was largely responsible for
releasing the records of Miller‘s
Army Air Force band. The Mill-
er estate then asked him to or-
ganize.a band to play in the
Miller tradition, and the present
outfit resulted.
