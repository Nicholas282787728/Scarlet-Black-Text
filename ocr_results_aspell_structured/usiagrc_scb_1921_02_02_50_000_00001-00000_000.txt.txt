Sooners on Tough Trip

0n the other hand, the Sooner-s are
now on the toughest trip which any
Valley team will make this season.
They left Norman early in the week
for Nebraska, and will play six Con»
fer-encc battles in as many days. They
went down to defeat Monday and last
night helore the strong Huskers. Toe
night and tomorrow they will mi
with Drake, coming to Grinnell Fri-
day. They, likewise, should he se-

of the trip.

Neither the Sooners nor the Pio-
neers have won a Conference tilt as
yet, although the former a,‘re expected
to take at least one from Drake

Cornell Gmne Peculiar

The Cornell Grinnell game Saturday
deserves special mention by reason of
the unusual nature of the score 31- 1.
Seldom, especially in intercollegiate
competition, does the score of
team run so low as a single point.

The Cul'Dcllians were unable to
count what shots they had at the ring,
and which perhaps should hale net-
ted them several points, They had

three chances from the foul line, Dee ,

Counting one of them for the only
point plucked by Fingcr's crew.
Cornell, late in the game, threw the
entire five men into her ﬂoal'u‘orli
so much as to leave the Gi'innell goal
unguarded ill a desperate attempt to
count points. As a result, Eva'ns was
able to toss tu‘o ringers from short
range practically without opposition.
The team played at Cornell minus
the services of Fearing :tnd Macy.
Who leturned here immediately after
the Cue game, in which both were in
'jnl'ed.

he wishes to sell them now, he will
