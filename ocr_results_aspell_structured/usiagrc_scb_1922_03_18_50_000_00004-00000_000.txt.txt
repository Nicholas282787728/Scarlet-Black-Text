“no wow KNOWS"

What happens when a woman equip-
pad with an eager spirit and a driv—
ing force of human energy plunge:-
into the game or life? Caught by the
glamor oi the world, she plays tor high
stakes, But under the tide of her
triumphs there ﬂows 3 suppressed
current or human sympathies—a gen—
ills for people.

Fanny Brandeis, the heroine of “No
Woman Knows" has behind her the in»
ﬂuence of thousands or years or one-
way thinking and one—way living and
herore her the limitless possibilities of
modern thinking and mhdern methods.

She Works out her Destiny along on
iginal lines, in spite o: the interfer-
eince of a mail—order king and the
advent or a cleanwut youth fI‘Dm the
old holue town. But somewhere in
the crossc rents love springs up and
caps the situation.
