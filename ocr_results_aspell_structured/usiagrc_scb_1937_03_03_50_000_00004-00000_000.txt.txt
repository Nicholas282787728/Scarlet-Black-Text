petition Saturday attemoon when
they meet Newton Y. M, c. A.

According to Erik Voss, acting
coach of the freshman squad, the
outlook for the coming meet is
not bright because of the poor
times turned in by the freshmen
last Sunday in trials.

Cagers to End

of an edge in the pregame dope.
He points to the fact that the
Pioneers have played some very
good ball games this winter and
is frankly of the opinion that
Friday night they will play an-
other very good game.
Coach Hopeful
The,Pioneer coach reasons the
matter thus and although his pic
ture may be colored too brightly,
it can never be said that J. c, was
a pessimist. Since the first Drake
game the Bulldogs have lost the
services of Paul Griffith, a tall
and handy center who rolled in

eight points while holding Luick
to three in the first encounter be-
tween the two teams. Geertsma,
the chap who has replaced Grits
fith, is neither as big nor as
handy. This coupled with the
steady improvement of Luick
should .give the Pioneers a defin-
ite advantage at the pivot poSir
tion.

The return of Jim LaMasney to
active service also stacks up in
favor of Grinnell, LaMasney held

leading scorer and all around
spark plug, to six points in the
first game. This amounts to
handcuffing the clever redhead,
and Jimmy is not loath to admit
that he thinks he can do a better
job next Friday. According to
the dope sheet this battle should
end in a draw.

hiilctich Weak Scorer

Nick Milctich, Drake’s other
guard, has not shown himself to
be a high scoring threat this
year, and either Hayward cr eon»
will figures on taking care of
Nick. The main thorn in the si e
of the Pioneers during the first
game was a black thatched streak
named Bud Sutcr, who dispoi-ted
himself at a forward position and
managed to tally 13 points in the
course of the proceedings. To
apply the shackles to Mr. Suter,
Coach Tniesdale is counting on
Hat Dean, the fastest of the Pio-
neer back court performers.

Lecturer Emphasizes Social
implications of Sexual Problems

 

The increasing social implicae
tions of sexual problems were
emphasized by Dr. E. D. Plass,
head of the department of one
stetrics at the University of Iowa,
in his lecture Tuesday morning to
men and women's orientation clas-
ses. He spoke on “Sex and Re-
production.”

“These problems are becoming
more and more important," Dr.
Plass declared, “and I think col-
lege students are coming to think
about them Seriously."

Birth Control Important

Birth control, according to the,
speaker, is one of the most im-,
portant of these problems. Int
discussing the problem, he said:i
“At present in this state there
is no attempt to limit pro-
creation among the inmates of me
stitutions for the feeblcemi'ndeil,
the infirm, and those with crime
inal tendencies.”

Dr. Plass recommended sterili-
zation as the most etfeetive means

of birth control in such instances,

 

because it is permanent, but does
not interfere with the sex life of
the individual. Contraception as
a means of birth control is in
some cases harmless but not per-
manent, according to the speaker.

Vciicrcai Disemes Dangerous

Venereal diseases were listed
by Dr. Floss as another serious
social problem caused by sex. “I
believe that blood tests for syph-
ilis should be required before
every marriage. Pregnant moth-
ers should also have blood tests,“
he added, "to be sure their child—
ren will not receive a heritage of
a venereal disease."

Beginning his lecture with the
statement that sex is necessary
for the continuation of the race,
Dr. Plass traced the development
of Sexual matun‘ty in the indi
vidual from the time of concep-
tion, showing how the pituitary
gland regulates growth, both phy-
sical and sexual.
