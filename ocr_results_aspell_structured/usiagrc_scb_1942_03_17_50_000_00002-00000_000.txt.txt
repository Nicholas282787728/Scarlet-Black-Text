O U. S. Hypocrisy.

We look with contempt upon the “Aryan
race superioﬁty" philosophy of the Nazis.
Britain‘s treatment of India is tagged as
a prime example of typical British hypocri-
Cy“
Yet for 100 years, over three million
negros ill the United States have been the
victims of our own special brand of race

superiority and hypocrisy.

Negros are being discriminated in indus-
tr the army, educational institutions and in
cm whole social set up in general. Only last
week riots broke out in Detroit when a 'Icw
llegros tried to move into a federal housing
unit, especially built for them.

Theoretically, they have equal rights un-
der the law as white citizens. Yet actually,
they have only the rights our prejudices
will allow them.

What is this democracy we pratc about in
the public places?

0 Only Five Minutes.

Is there an instructor with an inferiority
complex in the house?

Can you name any professor on the fac-
ulty who should be taken down a peg or
two?

Then listen.

No class has to wait more than five nlin~
utcs for any teacher to come to class. It
makes no difference whether the head man
be instructor, assistant professor, full—fledg—
ed professor, or head of department. Five
minutes is all the class must wait. Those
words come from the mouth of Dr. Conard,
dean of faculty.

It is rather pleasing to think of the Grill-
nell faculty as being such a democratic
group.

However, one point that Dr. Conal‘d fail-
ed to bring up—who is to decide when the
five minutes have elapsed? Professors,
students, college central, or the naval ob—
servatory‘.7

Simmons, accomplished last Sum
day afternoun What it had Set out
to do i to make an even greater
improvement over the outstanding
success of its February eighth
performance.

Although dampened by rainy
weather, the concert was received
enthusiastically by the small but
responsive audience. All sections
of the band seemed to be playing,
except for a few dark spots, with
increasing vigor and precision.

Mr. Paul Behm, high school
band conductor. should be espec-
ially complimented on his fine di-
rection of the lively and ever-
cbanging “Niobe” by N. DeRu-
bertisi

At present, over 24.000 people
are enrolled in the United States.

“The purpose of the Civil Air
Patrol is to establish a home do-
fense in the air as home guards,
fire wardens, as others are doing
on ion Bsnzhaf stated.

“Non-ilyers, both men and Wu-
men are needed in the corps, as
there must be ground crews and
observers to act in volunteer ca»
pacity,” he reported.

According to Grant 0. Gale, co-
ordinator of the c. P. T. program
on campus, the patrol offers an
opening for any student who is
interested in the various phases
of aviation.

"I feel that many Grinncll stu-

this opportunity to gain valuable
experience," Gale said.

Two pieces following this, Gour
nod‘s ”Mjrella. Overture" and the
“Symphony in B Minor" (Unfin—
is'hed Symphony) by Franz Chu-
bcrt, were both performed ex—
oollenuy.

A. very interesting composition,
Griselle's “Nocturne" (from No
American Sketches), was played
next. This piece is quite modern-
istic and was the most difficult
selectioon on the program.

Needless to say, full justice was
done the final “March.” Simmons’
second composition to he played
by .tho band since his arrival on
the campus last fall. The piece
has many variations in Speed, in
tensity. and pitch and is exceed-
ingly brilliant.

With both the woodwind and
brass choirs doing a good job.
mention should be made of the
great improvement by the per-
cussion section over its perform-
suce in the last band concert.
