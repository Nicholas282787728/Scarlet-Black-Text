Photographers say
yearbook is shoddy

To the Editor:

We, as photographers for the
Grinnell Cyclone, are appalled and
shocked at the shoddily edited 1987
yearbook. It is distressing to see
what we have worked so hard {or
appear to be purposely vandalized
and sabotaged,

We were under the impression
that the 1957 Cyclone was to be a
realistic study oi life at Grinnell
College. The basic idea was to be
able to look at a picture and think,
“Yes, that‘s the way it is, lhats
Grinnell." We enthusiastically
devoted a substantial amount of
time to this project. At the end oi
the year, we ielt that we had
managed to capture some
memorable images or Grinnell on
ﬁlm.

We eagerly awaited the arrival
oi the yearbook, but we have been
greatly disappointed. The year-
book contains numerous omis-
sions. There are also in»
discriminate cropping, mislabeled
pictures, poor picture choices, and
blatant censoring. The copies oi
pictures used in the yearbook are
watermarked. scratched, overexA
posed. and underexposed, There
are many pages where large
blocks oi white almost take over
hali the page and these areas could
easily have contained pictures.
The photographs oi good quality
that are included are ruined by
these problems. The overall effect
is terrible.

The quality oi the pictures
selected out at the pool 01 photos
available in the yearbook lile was
very poor. For many campus
events, there were pictures in our
files much better than the ones in
cluded in the book. There were
many good photographs that were
not included oi Relays, Alice in
Wonderland, Forum Beach, the
Waltzes, various parties, GORP,
etc....

One of the most disturbing of all
the errors in the yearbook is the
omission oi eight iaculty depart
ments. The Political Science,
English. Russian, Theater,
Classics, Education, Humanities,
and Spanish departments are not
included in the book, Many student
groups, resident advisors, our
campus houses, and various
special events are omitted irom
the book, even though the
photography staii provided pic-
tures of them.

All the speakers who appeared
on campus are ignored, with the
exception of Tom Wolfe, who is in a
blurry picture, The most notable
speaker who is excluded is Mario
Cuomo. There are pictures oi the
camera crews at graduation but
only a vague explanation oi why
they were there.

Another horriiying instance oi
the insensitivity on the editors'
part is the censoring oi the rugby
team This is not a mature judg-
ment to make in a college year-
book. especially at Grinnell. in a
case like this, it one is worried
about some gestures, one should
not include the photo at all. The
most ironic thing is that the
photographer took pictures oi the
team without the “undesirable"
gestures, so that the censoring was
not necessary at all,

There is also no continuity in the
book. Many unrelated pictures are
placed haphazardly together on
the same page. There are some
photographs with long descriptive
captions while many others have
none at all. The texts of various
stories are coniusing within the
format and in the end, are means
ingless.

Religious leaders and

politics: a dangerous combination

Once again I'm scared. original»
1y, l was scared about die lran-
oontra scandal. Aiter diat iear
began to die down, the repercus-
sions oi modern photographic
technology began to bother me.
Next Reagan nominated Robert
Bork tor the Supreme Court, pro»
viding additional fuel ior my iears.

John Newrnark

While I was worrying about Bork
the press began to bring the
Skeletons out of Joseph Biden’s
closet. With Biden out of the race, I
began to worry about the iuttire oi
the Democratic party. Finally, a
recent Time magazine article,
combined with other recent news
articles, has reawakened an old
iear of mine that has been lighting
for attention for quite a while. The
article was centered on the cams
paign oi Republican Presidential
candidate Pat Robertson, who also
happens to be an evangelical
minister. In the center of a
photograph depicting a Pat
Robertson rally, there was one ap-
parent Robertson ian waving a
sign which read, “Let's Bring
Jesus into the White House.”

1 couldn't help recalling a person
I met a iew years back who, in the
past two Presidential elections,
voted for two ”write~in" can-
didates. In 1580 she voted for
Jesus, and in 152% she voted for
Jesse Jackson, a Baptist minister
who last me Democratic Primaries
to Mondale. Her switch in is“ to
Jackson was not the result of a
realistic enlightenment, ior i got
the idea she would have voted for

Jesus again if Jackson hadn't been
running.

1 have no problems with
religious leaders running {or Presi-
dent; I also would not hesitate to
Vote for one, under certain condi-
tions. A religious leader is bound to
have more compassion and
understanding ior the common
person, and thus is more likely to
protect the rights American
citizens have taken for granted ior
the past two centuries. However,
there is a difference between the
advantages rising irom a strong
religious faith and the disadvan-
tages falling from the beliefs held
by Robertson, especially, and
perhaps Jackson as well.

The separation between church
and state creates a fine line when a
minister or any other religious
leader runs [or President; Robert
son has overtly crossed this line.
He has proclaimed to all the world
that he is me one Presidential can-
didate endorsed by God Himself.
As he is the Anointed One, no selfr
respecting evangelist can vote
against him, If he is elected Presir
dent, an established state religion
is not far away. This is not an exagr
gel-ation.

The one most important candle
tion under which I would consider
voting tor a religious leader is that
the candidate show toleration of
other religions. Robertson has not
shown this, and neiﬂler have his
supporters. Jesse Jackson claims
that tolerance exists in his “Rain-
bow Coalition," but he has put his
foot in his mouth too many times
ior me to believe this anymore. As
lsaid previously, i do not object to
these two candidates running ior
President. Their candidacy only
proves how tree a nation we are in
that anybody can run ior President
if he or she meets the basic
guidelines set aside in the Constitur
tion.

Furthermore. there is a long
history at religious leaders running
for President. Perhaps the most
iamous case is William Jennings
Bryan, popularized as the pro
secutor in the Scopes Monkey
Trial, He ran ior President three
times at the turn of the 20th cen-
tury and lost by a wide margin all
three times. Herein lies my {ear of
Jackson and Robertson. Both of
these candidates are doing ex-
tremely well in the polls. While the
heads oi both parties agree that the
two candidates are unelectable,
the polls lead one to believe there is
a possibility. li such a large por-
tion oi our society is willing to sup
port these two ministers, the iuture
oi our democracy lies in question.

I do not believe Robertson or
Jackson will be elected. The party
leaders will do everything in their
power to keep them oii the ticket,
and they don’t have the support to
win a write-in candidacy.
However, i am ieariui oi the trend
in the populace to experiment with
the barrier between church and
state, While clerical Presidents,
school prayer, secularist book»
burnings, creches on courthouse
lawns, etc. each threaten only one
brick in this proverbial wall, the
iramersoi the Constitution built
the wall solid for a purpose. Even
the smallest oi holes is big enough
ior some things to crawl through,
and once trails have been broken,
history tells us, the trails turn into
roads. 'l'hese roads turn into
highways. in order to perpetuate
this nation, where all mankind is
created equal, where lite, liberty,
and the pursuit oi happiness are
considered the supreme law of the
land, we must make sure every
last brick contained in the wall
separating church and state re:
mains firm and intact. This is one
area in which experimentation is
too dangerous to contemplate.

 

Students clarify their criticism

To the Editor:

Three weeks ago we wrote a let»
tcr to the Scarlet and Black cancers
ning the declining quality in recent
editorials, specifically in reierence
to the first one oi this year. This
past week two letters appeared in
the paper in response to our letter;
the authors seem to have
misunderstood our major point,

Four weeks ago the Scarlet and
Black published an editorial cons
cerning the college's iailure to
identity the Black Cultural Center
with a marker. Many oi the black
students were angered by the
thoughtlessness oi the administrate
tion, Their anger is understan
dablc; some students weren't even
able to locate the Center during
New Student Days. Had it ignored
a situation such as this one in
which charges oi racism were
leveled against the administration,
the S and B would have indeed
been negligent, We were NoT
arguing that the story should not
have been covered.

However. we assert that lt could
(and should» have been handled in
a more oiicctivc manner- A wells
researched, well-written news
report in which the Situation was
thoroughly investigated and all

parties involved were interview-
ed would have been the superior
approach This type oi article
would have allowed the student
body to decide ior themselves
whether racism or oversight
(albeit thoughtlesst was the reason
ior the absence or a marker in
iront oi the Black Cultural Center.
instead, we were presented with
an editorial which implied irom
beginning to end that racism was
the underlying motive. though
Wally Walker might stress other
wise, llencc, our statementconc
ning “an obvious lack or i-
telligence or foresight" was in
reierence to the quality oi and
manner in which the editorial was
written. but certainly not the sub
ject with which it dealt.
Wedonotdenythatinstutionaliz-
cd racism exists in the US, in
lowa, or even here on the Grinnell
campus. To believe otherwise
would be, in the least, naive and
certainly ignorant in this situa-
tion. however. we do not ieel that
racism was the causc, We do not
ask that the Scarlet and Black
agree with us, we only ask that the
student body be given the opporr
tunity to make their own decision

based on iacts tree irom editorial
innuendo.

We also ieel it necessary to res~
pond to the assertions made that
we are concerned only with inter-
national racism. lt is in-
conceivable to us how our
reierence to South Alrica could
have been interpreted in that way
Our letter was certainly not a call
to iocus on international racism;
the reierence to South Atrica was
used merely as an instance in the
past where the administration
needed to be criticized ior its
williul insensitivity to a situation,
on a local level, the iailure oi the
administration to hire a substan-
tial number oi black taculty is
another example oi blatant, williul
insensitivity. These are the issues
that should be the iocus oi the
editorial column's criticism, not
issues where it may be and pro-
bably is an unintentional tNO'l‘
WILLFUL) act oi insensitivity.
Our iear is that ii the administra-

tlon is Consistently cl‘itlclzed by the ,
s and u editorials. the columns,
power will be less ctiective whenr

Foreign
students

need
more aid

To the Editor:

There is perhaps little doubt that
the large number ot international
students in Grinnell contributes
signiiicantly in bringing the sociOr
cultural diversity that any good
college requires. However, it is a
sad thing that the amount oi iinan-
cial aid ior international students
is limited to hali oi the tuition (ape
prox $5000). At Grinnell we like to
think how radical and liberal we
are and that this great college is
one oi the best in the nation. Some
oi the prestigious colleges like Har-
vard, MlT, Staniord, and Yale ole
ier iull iinancial aid tor ioreign
students. Most oi the colleges that
were high on the list or top lo
liberal arts colleges ihkc Swar-
thmorc, oberhn. and l-iaveriordl
also oiier a more generous [inane
cial aid package ior international
students. Apparently, Grinnell has
not become very liberal about its

challenging the administration on: iinanctal aid policy towards lntcrr

Correction

Last week the S and B reported
incorrectly that the Grinnell rugby
team, the oriiiins, won their game
against Newton. The article should
have said the Griiims lost 0 to 44.
