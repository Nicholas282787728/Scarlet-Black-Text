Pioneers Compete
At Napierville
Saturday

Ten Grinnell college indoor
iunncrs will compete against 16
or 20 schools Saturday at Na—
pierville, m, in the annual Mid—
west Collegiate meet. Only 10
men from each school are allow-
ed to enter the meet which is an
invitational affair.

On paper, it appears that the
three outstanding schools in the
meet will he the Pioneers, Pitts
burg (Kan) State Teachers col»
lege and North Central college,
the hosts. Grinnell has already
defeated the North Central squad
once this year in dual competi-
tion but the introduction of other
schools into the final scoring will
change the complexion of the
competition considerable.

The Pioneers will be especially
strong in the hurdles and the
middle distances, with plenty of
power in all the other events on
the program, although the 10 con—
testant restriction displaces the
balance of the Scarlet Squad to
some extent.

Men making the trip will in
clude Appelquist, Granny. Hagan,
Hayward, Pfohl, Powers. Schlot»
terheck and Seeger. The other
two men will he picked later in
the week from Pedersen, Robin~
son, Balchly and Luther. Bill
Sampson, star weight man, will
probably be unable to compete
because of a back Injury.

Below we are gi ’iig the zill-

‘confercnce team picked by Coach

John c. Truesdale for the Asso-
ciated Press. It will also he used,
according to Truesdale, as his
vote when the athletic directors
pick their all-conference team at
the anode lloop meeting.

Don't be surprised that there
are no Grinnell players on the
team. The voting rules require
that the coach picking the team
use none of his own players. We
will. in all probability, use this
team for our vote when the
sports writers of conference pa-
pers pick their team, unless any-
one has any serious objection to
any of the players picked.

\S'o'd also like to comment on
the great showing John Hayward
made in the all-around champion-
ships at the University of Illinois
Saturday. John collected hotter
than 5,300 points to place second
in some of the best competition
in the country. His outstanding
feat. considering that he is essen-
tially a hurdler and weight man,
is his victory in the half mile run
in 2:103. That performance
shows the advantages of good
conditioning the year around.
Now that thc shouting and ex-
citement of the basketball season
are over, we‘d like to mention
here the accomplishments of the

 

wrestling and swimming teams.

Finish Dual Card
Saturday Night

The varsity swimming squad
will meet its first opponent in
two weeks here Saturday when
it tackles the mermen from Ila
linois college.

The nieet promises to be close
with comparative time figures l'nr
dicating a slight edge for the
Pioneers, according to Coach
Doyle Reynolds. The Illinois
swimmers have defeated the
Monmouth college team which
was downed by the Pioneers two
weeks ago.

The Pioneers have the advan—
tage of a two-week layoff broken
only by a freshman—varsity dual
last Saturday which saw two
records bettered.

John Widdup gained the only
win for the prep squad by lead—
ing Foster. of the varsity, to
finish the 100»yard hreast stroke
in 1: 4.2, a new college record.
The former record was held by
Foster at 1:183.

The varsity relay team set a
new college record when Melgard,
Foster and Lamberson swam the
ISO-yard medley event in 2:07,
bettering the old record by nine
seconds.

Hayward Second in
AII‘Around Even’r

AT Illinois Relays

John Hayward, star Pioneer
hurdler and weight man, took
second place in the allsal'ound
championships in the University
of Illinois relays' Saturday. Hay-
ward scored 5399 172 points.

McLane of Southeastern Mis-
souri State Teachers college,
scored 5513 points to win first
place, while Brunton of the Uni-
versity of Illinois scored 5264
points for third. In the 17 years
of the championship, only four
men have beaten Hayward's point
total, according to G. Lester
Duke, varsity track coach.

In open events, Schlotterbeck
oi Grinnell scored a. third place
out of 22 entrants in the 1000*
yd. run. He failed to qualify in
the soc—yd. dash. Powers of Grin-
nell qualified for the semifinals
of the 75~yd. low hurdles, but
fell over a hurdle in the semi<
final trials. Appeiquist failed to
qualify in the sprints,

when wrestling was not even a
minor sport here and has, hy
turning out strong, well-trained
teams, hrought wrestling to the
very verge of a major sport. The
great interest in wrestling shown
this year has testified to the ex-
cellent job that has heen done.

And we can’t forget the Swim—
ming team and the better-than-
usual-record they have piled up
this year, winning a series of
meets in stiff competition. Doyle
Reynolds, in spite of being new
on the job here, has done an ex-

 

experienced wrestlers at a timelceIIenL piece of work.

Modern engineering offers a
career to women as we“ as men,
according to Dean E. A. Holhrook
of the University of Pittsburgh
school of engineering.
