The state of the spoken word at Grinnell College

on a warm spring day rrr May, over
300 students will strut across the stage
on ccnrral campus. receive a diploma
and enter the world scarcely any better at
public speaking than when they aii‘ived
four years before, conrrary to the claims
oi’rhe college’s mission statement.

It is no secret among students or
professors that few at this school can
speak well—effectively and even beauri-
fully~in from of an audience, and visio
ing speakers are often as bad or worse.
Student presentations are, With one
exception, unpleasant for all parties in-
volved, and I know of only a liundﬁil of
professors who can susrain a lecrure for
an entire class period. Indeed, sometimes
I wonder ifpoor speaking skills may ex-
plain why so many professors depend on
discussions to get through rho hour even
when a lecture would teach the material
more succinctly and clearly.

And the sorry state of the spoken
word at the college continues despite
the college’s aim to “graduate women
and men who can think clearly, who can
speak and write persuasively and even
eloquently," as the mission statement
says. By dris poinr in rhe college’s his
tory, Professor Jack P. Ryan must have
bored a hole through his coffin vmlls
having spun so marry times.

Ryan was a colorful and popular

speech professor ar the collcgc from
1903 to 1947. He taught basic coins
niunications to first years and advanced
communications tojuniois. I~Ic iequiicd
each student to deliver Six speeches over
the course ofthc semester. Ryan's roachs
rug toners were: no rules but principles,
learn by doing, speaking is a means to
an end, the outline is important, the
speech must be beautiful and effective,
it is important that

beginning students be

wellstaught.

A 1916 syllabus of
his focuses on the face,
cycs, head, hands, arms, fcet, trunk, the
whole body, inflection, enuncirtion, and
pronunciation. Ryan saw that speak—
ing involved every part of the body and
mind, which may cxplain why he be,
lieved his subject was the most impors
tant taught on campus~"the art of arts,"
he called it.

Ryan believed in the shorr speech.
“At Newton, Iowa they make one-min»
uie washing machines. At Grinnell we
make onesminute speeches," he would
say. To Ryan, a longer speech lasted four
to live minutesAnd ro encourage quick
thinking, he would assign three minute
speeches then limit the student to two
upon arrival.

After Ryan died, the college let the

specch department die because it was
perceived as less rntcllccrually rrgorous
than other departments, according to
Professor Brad barenran, Economics,
who touches a class on tho college's hiSs
lory.
Although once a part of thc [TH/mm
of medieval liberal urts colleges, speech
and rhcroric departments declined
around rhc Country in rho sixties and
seventies as curricula
opened and require
ments diminished.
But I think we can still
rcvivc some of Ryan's
contributions to the curriculum even if
we do not revive the department.

We live in an increasingly image-
laden age of communication, but maybe
professors could teach srudeurs not to
lose sighr of the spoken languages ess
sence to communication by discourage
ing the use of Powerpoint presentations,
for instance. Powerpoinr can certainly
enhance some talks, but just as often it
seems to shift the audience’s attention
from the spoken word to pointless im—
ages and colorful design schemes that
tend to distract more than they complcs
merit.

Moreover, professors could follow
Ryan and assign shorr speeches and de-
mand more from the alt/ivuy ofinsclass

presentations. The college could also
hire someone to tutoi speech and \voik
in collaboration with the writing ccnrer.
indeed, the college could even expand
the wriring center based on the model
of the speaking, aigu‘mg, anti wiiting
program founded by Mount liolyoke
College in rhe 90s.

To be sure, one current constraint on
rho faculty is timoFor example, Baternan
says he must cover his course’s content,
and assrgn and grade papers, and “Tlietc
just isn’t time for me to also become
speech coach" In addition, many pres
fcssors are engaged in timesconsuming
research, leaving them less time to learn
new skills, such as teaching speech.

But even if the particular solutions
now elude us,wc need only the will and
creativity to begin integmting speech
into the curriculum more thoroughly.
And 2004 should have made clear that
speech is wanting in America when
Kerry was occasionally eloquent but
rarely clear, and Bush was occasionally
clear but rarely eloquent.

So, ifGrinnell could, in fact, gradu-
ate better speakers, the question for
future years becomes: how can we best
learn from examples like Ryan, adhere
to the college’s stated aims and illumi-
nate the link between clear thinking and
persuasive and eloquenr speech?

Americans: fit your attitude and stuff in a carry-on

In my mind, there's a frne line between being
an accepted nomad and a perpetual tourist; I would
prefer to be regarded as the former. For Spaniards,
there’s a fme line between a real gypsy (or “gitaiio”)
and an American tourist; they snub populations on
both sides of the line with different degiees of
fervor. Spaniards have an ambiguous hatred for

the "girano" population in Southern Madrid

and more of a disgusted bafﬂemcnt towards
American Visttors.

While they can easily afford to reiecr,
conscience aside, the alrcudysmurglnulizcd
gypsics, tourism is the country's main ins
dustry, so like with the immigiants, they
need to watch their step.

Thar said, after living in Hawaii
for frve ycars.wherc tourism rs also the
laigcst industry, and havmg traveled
through more countiics as a tourist
than any Grinnelliun I can think of, I
now stand from on high to proclaim “American tour
ists suck!"

Madrid is adorably compact. In its tiny apart-
merirs with tiny doors and tiny chairs and riny beds
and tiny showers live tiny people who drive tiny cars
on tiny streets to tiny cafes to sip tiny“cafe's con leche”
and go to tiny parks wbcrc tiny old men walk tiny
dogs and drink riny beers in tiny bars. Everythrng is
wondcrhrlly shrunken and conserved,

I asked an American kid from Arkansas I met
on a tram to throw out some American stereotypes.
The first thing he said was “Everything is bigger in
Texas."

America is big. Big Americans come with their
big maps and engage in big struggles to tame said big
maps to shove them into big bags with big snacks and
big souvenirs rhar are too big {or the big bag and cres
ate big fusses when they swing the big bags into big

crowds. Then they cram their big suitcases into

big toui buses with other big Americans who aie
also big chickens and hide in the big buses in
big groups,

Now, rf they would
just be bold enough to
ditch the tour, duck
into a col'ncr to fold
theii maps to the
section rhcy are
looking at, chuck
the American
snacks, cxchunge the crappy souvo
nirs for posrcards, bring less than
half their wardrobes (r 11y, they
only ever wear the big idraki shorts wirh big floppy
hats, anyway), pick up a smaller bag and suitcase, and
srart wandering around looking for a lrosrel or local
resraurarrr or grocery store, they would be well on
their tray to being less despised, political atiiliuions

aside.

Nextblg problem: Big Americans corrre wirh then
big beach chairs and big rowcls to rake photos with
big cameras ot‘drcir brg sclvcs in big srrnglasscsTlrcy
march their big butts overbig sections ol'coral despite
the brg sign made for the big tourists saying they will
be in big trouble ifthey walk on the coral reef
