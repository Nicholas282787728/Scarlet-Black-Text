League Board's '
Quad Prepping
Begins Monday

Prepping for women will he-
giri on Monday, according to in-
formation released this week by
the League Board,

The emphasis in this year's
prepping will be on establish
ing better relationships between
freshman and upperclass wo-
men.

Since freshmen women are
separated from upperclassinen
to a large extent, the League
Board has included interfloor
spreads and other activities
throughout the entire year to
bring/ the two groups together.

Table assignments this year
will be made out by the YWCA
and other organizations, with
the purpose of producing more
variety in group representation,

Sidney Marshall, League Board
representative, has been work-
ing with a committee formed
of members of the c of HP
and social chairmen, to work
out a more adequate system of
co~educationé1 dining.

In regard to palrior light»
ing, the League Board has de-
cided to leave the amount of
illumination in parlors Ill) to
each hall. After the suggestion
made by the C of HP to
blackout parlors from 9:30-
10:15 p.m., the League Board‘s
decision was that this would
be unfair to casually dating
couples.

The Little Theatre will be
available to dates, but parlors
will not be arbitrarily darkened,
according to President Lois
Grosser.

Better music in the quad.
rangle dining room will be en-
couraged by the League Board
and music chairman Sue Sar-
baugh. Tentative plans include
inviting students to provide mur
sic during dinner.

The Board will recommend
that more money be appor-
tioned to each mm from the
Social Budget committee for
the purpose of facilitating
more informal hall parties.
Another goal .

League Board members will be'
to place more responsibiiity in
hall officers, encouraging in-
terest and investigation along
legislative lines. A proposed
suggestion being considered now
would set up judicial councils
within each hall.

A combined constitution for
the Student Counil, c of HF
and League Board, which
would set up a college appeal
board, is still being worked
out, This project was begun
jointly by the three groups
last spring.

Cooperation of all college wo—
men has been requested by the
Board in their aims of encour-
ing hall spirit. special talent,
improving study conditions and
creating more unity among hall
members.

These principles will be a
vital part of the League Board’s
attempt to promote a positive
aspect of their Vactiv es, dis-
courage a negative attitude to-
ward their responsibilities and
yet maintain their judicial re-
sponsibilities, according to pres-
ident Grosser.

Nor’ron leads Grinnell Offense

“Participating in college foot~

of men all working together
as a team {or a common cause,"
says Bob Norton, Grinncll sen.

Bob, an economics major;

years. He was a resident of

junior, and now lives in the

Young Harrier Team

. Looks to Future

The Grinnell cross—country
crew, under the tutelage of
Coach EG Booth, continues to
round into shape this week in
preparation for the first meet of
the season with St. Olaf at
Northfield, Minn, on October
10,

Prospects of making any im-
provement on last year’s 1—3
record are very dim, according
to Booth. The squad has been
hit hard by graduation, ineligi-

 

bility, and injuries, which is
shown by the fact that there:
isn’t a single returning letterrl
man on the roster. l

However, several promising
sophomores headed by George
Drake, who was a standout as.
a freshman last year, are ex-'
peeled to make a respectable
showing for the Pioneers this
year.

This season probably can be
called a rebuilding year. With a
good freshman team coming ulp
to supplement the sophomores,
Booth reports that he should‘
have some tough harriers in a
year or two. '

him, spenrls what little time

sight to see Bob rolling on the

Favori’res Triumph
ln Opening Games

Coe, Lawrence, and St. Olaf,
rated in that order in a pre
season poll of the Midwest Con»
ference coaches, have begun
their seasons in impressive rash--
ion. The Coe Kohawks, dhampr
ions in ’52, started out by bowl-
ing over Knox 26-12 this past
Saturday.

The Lawrence Vikings blank.

State- the week before. After
overpowering the Knox Si-
washers 28-19 a week ago Sat-
urday, the St. Olaf Lions
stepped out of the Conference
to blast Wartburg 35.14.

Monmouth and Ripon also
posted initial conference wins
this past week. td share the top
spot in the standings with Coe,
Lawrence, and St. Olaf. The
Monmouth Scots were very imr‘
pressive in their 25-7 victory

beaten Cornell 25-6 the weekl
befdre. The Scots' showing in
this game, as well as their 14-0
win over Au ustanta. indicates
they will be ight in the Ehick
of thc,flght. Third in '52, the
Scots were ranked seventh in a
preseason poll of the coaches
because of especially heavy
graduation losses.

Ripon took advantage of
Cornell fumbles to pull out a
144; win before a Cornell Par-
ents Day CNN/d.

Only Lawrence and Monmouth
of the five teams so far undo,
feated in conference play will
put their records on mhe line this
coming Saturday. The Vikings
are favored to win over a visit-
ing Carleton aggregation, where
as the Monmouth Scots should
not have tod much orouble with
a vwice»beaten Cornell Ram out-
fit. The Rams ial'e weakened .by
the loss, through injury, of their
first string quarterback, Bryan
Valetto, who did not see actidn
against Ripori and may be out
for some time.

In the only other conference
game on the slate, the Knox
srwnshers journey to Grinncil.
Both‘ teams will be looking for
their first conference win.

Coe and St. Olaf will test
their i wer-hduses against non-

Slants on Sports

b y George Simon

Last year Grinnell edged Knox 25.20 in a thrilling footbau
game on Ward field, but the record books will always list the
game as Knox 33, Grinneli 25.

Due to mechanical trouble in the scoreboard clock, the tilt
ran 23 minutes overtime, during which the Siwashers pushed
through a tiring Pioneer eleven for 'two T.D-'s and turned defeat
into victory.

s-o-s

A comparison of the 1952 Lawrence game (28-6) and last
Saturday's clash (254)) reveals that a year ago the Vikings
bulled through the middle of the Grinnell line, but this season
they consistently drove through or around the very ineffective
Pioneer defensive ends. If Grinnell’s gridders want to Win some
games this year, they'll have to plug up the gaping holes at their
wing positions—hut fast!

Cross-country prospects for this fall looked wonderful last
sprin» Veterans Dave Quitub, Barry Lawrence John Shean, Frank
Hays, Jim Thompson, Dick Johnson, and freshmen George Drake

‘ and Bill Hildebrand were counted on to push Gi‘innell to first

spot among conference harriers.

Now the outlook is gloomy indeed, Only Hays and Drake are
back. Qutub is ineligible; some of the others have transferred while
some seem to have lost the desire to compete. As a result coach
E.G. Booth is having lots of trouble scraping together even the
minimum five men which a team must enter in the three mile run.

Coach John Pfi'isch lost a key man last week when Dick

mighty rough time during the first few minutes of the game, and

mances all season long. He’ll be sorely missed, and Grinnell fans
can be glad that Dick has tVéro £311 sseasons still ahead of him.
