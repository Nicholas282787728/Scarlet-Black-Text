The concept oi a joint town and

series oi ”Community Clennrups”
during the early sixties.

Following the closing oi the col-
lege in the spring or '70, and lol-

as a result oi that closing, the
concept was reintroduced under the
name “Community Days." The pro-
]ects, ranging from clearing clut-

inibrmal contact between students
and members at various town ser-
vice clubs in an amiable environs
ment.

This year the high school students
have been asked to participate be-
cause they have, as an age group,
the least contact with college stu-
dents.

that do not show their love."
