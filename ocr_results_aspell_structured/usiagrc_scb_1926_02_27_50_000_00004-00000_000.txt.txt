[lean llnllen Talks Tn Y.
Un Science And Religion

"The spirit or on stianity is heing
cxempliticd today more in the lahora»
tories than in the churches," said Dean
J, s. Nollen before the men at the Y.
M. c. A. meeting held in the cluhroom
or Building in Thursday night,

Alter Maurine rarzyhoh had sung
two solos, accompanied at the' piano
or Irene woi y, Dean Nollen cy-
plaiued the ditl'erence in the old and
the new idea or conception of religion,
rcoplc oi the older generation had
that idea of dualism, or complete sop-
arotion of body and soul. They be.
liered the body should be starved to
feed the soul and vice versa. They
considered this world but a stopping
place on the way to heaven.

Now/he said, Christianity is lcolied
upon as including the whole uui ersc;
it must solve its problcms with the
world as a unit. In stating that scir
ellce is exemplitied more in the labor—
atories than in the churches, he points
ed out Pasteur and his work as an
example. In science there must be
two things: a complete reverence for
truth and a complete reverence tor
lire. “And isn't that Christianity?" he
asked. “For the first time,” Dean
Nolien concluded, “Christianity is be»
ing met with the challenge of lite . , .
and we have come ‘to the time when an
application of Christianity is most
real.
