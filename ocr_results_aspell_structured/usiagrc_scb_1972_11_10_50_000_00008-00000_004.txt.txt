Grinnell House: latest

by Martha Wacker

Simple and stately, built on a rise at 1011
Park Street thatdraws attention toits prom-
inence, Grinnell House has been a center
of hospitality for campus visitors since
1961. The CDanial Georgian exterior and
mixed period pieces inside, many of them
gifts to the college, provide a relaxed and
elegant atmosphere for visiting guests, cote
loquia, seminars, and informal meetings.

Grinnell House was, until eleven years
ago, the home oi four successive college
presidents and their families. Its varied
history dates to its construction in 1916,
at which time the former President’s Home
was torn down, The latter, which stood on
the spot now occupied by Grinnell iiouse,
and the original home preceding it, date
to the early years of the college itseli and
figure importantly in the history ofthe town
and ofGrinnell College

The home of the first president and his
wite, Dr. and Mrs. George F. Magoun, was
located at the southwest corner of Sixthand
Broad. Early Victorian Gothic was the type
of architecture, otherwise known as pre-
Civil War style. The Magouns owned the
house privately when Dr. Magoun began his
term as president in 1865, and continued
to occupy it after his nineteen year term
ended. An official residence was then pur-
chased almost immediately, for the next
president.

The Magoun house was later moved from
its original site three times under different
ownerships, and today is located at 1130
Summer, the home of Professor and Mrs,
Greg Guru“. Only the front halfofthehuuse
still stands, the porch has been removed,
and it has been repainted a deep red,

Originally, the house had a Gothic style
porch displaying columns with Victorian
Gothic capitals, Other noteworthy features
include a broken rootllne. set-in windows
with truncated points, and narrow window-
panes.

One of Grinnell’s finest houses became the
first official President’s Home in 1887,
directly alter coerge Gates began his term
as second president of the college. Pur-
chased from Henry G. Little, the two»story
brick dwelling stood at the current site
of Grinnell House. In an article for the
Grinnell paper on March 16, 1917,the author
Mrs. Jesse Macy speaks fondly ofthe house
with its winding staircase with mahongany
rail and newell post, deep cornices and
built-in cupboards. The Little House was
built in 1867 in the postrCivi Wartradition;
hairstyle and Victorian Gothic. This period
of eclectic architecture added embelish-
ments that included a flat roof with heavy
overhang, elaborate Gothic ironwork, and a
“widow’s watch” on top of the house. These
features are noticeable today in Grinnell on
other homes built during the same period.

Little built the house with the aid of Grins
nell College students who included the
brothers Gershom 1'1. and James L. Hill.
They were the sons of James J. Hill who
gave the first silver dollar towards the
founding of Grinnell College. The brothers
graduated in 1871 and as prominent
professional men donated large sums of
money to the college. The money was
intended for the purpose of buying property
for the college south of Sixth Avenue, an
area which was to have been called Hills
Brothers’ Park. The area, where the Episs
copal church now stands, was finally made
into a small park called the Botanical Gar»

Out of respect for the institution he loved,
Little sold the house to the college for a
Very reasonable price and it became the
home of Presidents George A, Gates, Dan
r. Bradley, and John Main. During the time
of President Gates’ term many prominent
visitors were received at the house, among
them editor Horace Greeley. His command
to J, B Grinnell to “Go west, young man,
go west” had resulted in the founding oithe
town of Grinnell in 1854. Other visitors
included Booker T. Washington, Mr. and
Mrs. Ballington Booth, Jane Adams (of Hull
House fame), and Mrs. Julia Ward Howe; as
well as numerous guest artists, musicians,
and lecturers. .

By the year 1915, the college was wealthy
and prestigious enough to begin plans for a
finer, larger President’s Home, A building
fund was begun in that year to raise the
$56,000.00 necessary for the new residence.
Generous subscriptions to the house fund
included the names of over 100 trustees.
alumni, and friends of the college, However.
when a larger fund drive began for the pur-
pose of building ARH and other buildings,
the college took over the task of financing
the house.

Not without regret, the Litlle home was
torn down so that the new home could be
built on the college-owned property. Boston
architects Brainerd and Leeds were the
architects of the house. Built after the colour
ial Georgian style, it represented a trend
away from the elaborate features of the
post-Civil War types. The Italianpalladian,
which consists of the [an light over the
door and the true classical Greek col»
umns on either side, is one feature 01' this
simple and elegant style. One may also
take notice of the dormer windows, hip
(or jointed) root and absence of gab»
les. and the rounded conservatory, which
was first used by Mrs. Main as a greenr
house.

The house was designed at a time when
domestic help was both plentiful and in-
expensive, and consists of eighteen spac-
ious rooms and five and a half baths loo
cated on three floors, plus service andgame
rooms in the basement 01' Special inter-
est is the sevenvfoot bathtub on second floor,
built to accomodate President Main’s six
feet and five inches. Other luxuries included
the five fireplaces, a service elevator, an
intercom system, and a central vacuum
cleaner system with outlets in every room.
The college paid a tive»in maid during the
presidents' residences. After President
Main’s death in 1931, the house was occupr
ied by Presidents John S. Nollen, Samuel N,
Stevens, and Howard R. Bowen and their
families,

A need for more convenient nccomodations
for campus visitors, as well as a desire
to utilize the large house more efficiently,
led to decision by the trustees in 1961 to
build a new familyesize residence at 1600
Park Street for the president and convert
