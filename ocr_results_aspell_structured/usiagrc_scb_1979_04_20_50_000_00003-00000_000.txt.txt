The Time-Life Journalism
Program provides Grinnell
students exposure to principal
issues in the lield, while not
diverting them irom a thorough
liberal arts education says
Director or College Relations
William Deminot'f, coordinator of
the program.

Wait Stone, assistant protessor
oi political science and a member
oi the Journalism Program
Committee. said. “The students
have shown the greatest interest in
political journalism, but now we
need to diveisity into areas such as
the arts, criticism. sports and the
antirestablishment press,“

"GROWTH HAS BEEN built into
the program." said Deminoll.
“This first part has been made up
mainly oi major representatives
from the media because they are
the people who have major voices
on controversial issues»they are
opinion leaders."

However. David Jordan,
professor oi history, said, “The
lecture series has exclusively
iocused on the top level of the
television and newspaper media.
While this might be exciting, it
seems that the program should
provide a broader spectrum oi
experience in the lield oi jourr

“WIIILE BUILDING ON the
strength at the iirst two years, we
should broaden our Vision to cover
the complete range DI journal' tic
activities," Jordan said ”Editing

These are the areas that most of
our Students will be involved in, at
least in the early years or their
careers "

Deminoi'i' said the series should
include more speakers irom all the
principal parts oi the media “This
is going to he a new element in the
program next year.” he said.

“Journalists involved in
magazine and television
documentary work and those
covering business and scientific
developments as well as those in
the print and broadcast media will
be brought to campus in the next
phase ot the program," he said,

The program plan calls lor each
visitor to deliver a major public
lecture ioilowed by a workshop
conducted for those students who
are spectfically interested in
journalism either as a career or as
a held in which they have an in
tense academic interest The
public lectures have been
scheduled for the evening of the
that day. and the workshops on the
iollowing day, in the interim. the
Visitors have held informal
meetings with iacuity and
students. The lecturers have also
appeared on lowa Public Broads
casting Network programs and
their talks have been printed and
spread heyond the campus

TIIE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED
to TimerLiIe tor funding at the
second phase said it is “hoped"
there will be sufficient funds to
bring in two or three Iowa
reporters to attend the workshops
as panelists. along with the visiting
lecturer. However, oi the $0,000
provided lor the program next
year, 57.500 has been slated for
three speakers at about $2,500
each.

"For $2.500 I \iould rather see us
bring in live people involved in
ditterent endeavors and varying
stages of their careers. rather than
one hig name irom Washington
D or New York,. said Jordan
”\V Could ask our own illumlll

llemlnolf Said

Deminottsaid he hopes a class in
has journalistic techniques will
lie oilered next year. although it
would be a nuscredit course.
