GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Not Much Men,
Heap of Squaw,
Ugh! No Story

By Carolyn Buldom
This is the lament of a feature
writer whose feature fell flat.

Her story, outlined to her by
the editor. was a natural. It was
a natural because it had to do
with an unnatural situation. The
situation was unnatural because
it had to do with the fact that
there were more men than women
enrolled at Grinnell this year.

so the feature writer was hap-
Ipy about the whole thing. Here
was a chance to put men in their
place, paradoxically enough, bee
cause there were more of them.
’Here at last was the long-awaited
opportunity for the women to
pick and choose critically with a
surplus of masculinity on the
campus the coed would now be the
one to “look over the prospects."

The situation promised to be
very interesting indeed, even if
unnatural. Now the men would
he forced into battle—and the
women would determine those
most fit to survive the social
whirl.

A date for every Grinnell wo-
man! A bevy of brawny he-men
waiting for the phone to ring!
The usual Grinnell line-up com-
pletely reversed! A woman's
world!

And while the feature writer
was happily contemplating such
a Utopia, the unofficial figures re-
leased from the offices of the
deans of men and women coldly
dispelled any such wild notions.
Even a feature story writer
can see that 344 quadrangle resi—
dents total more than 321 dormi~
tory dwellers And since there
are again, as usual, more women
than men on the campus, where's
the feature in it?

The writer, minus a story, gave
up the idea of buying a varsity
ticket.
