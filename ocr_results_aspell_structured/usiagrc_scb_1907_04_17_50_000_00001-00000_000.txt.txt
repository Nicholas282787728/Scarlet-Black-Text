both sides providing surprises in the
dilfei'eut events.

The tiny wits not at all a pleasant
one. the cold making it uncomfortable
ior both contestants and spectators,
a chilly wind blowing almost directly
from the north, while it made iast
time possible on the short dashes,
made the distant runs and field cy‘ents
especially dillicuit and added to the
spectdml's’ discomfort.

A large crowd, however, braved the
cold and was present, both srdes be-
ing well represented andsuppoited by
yells and songs TlleFresllmen’s new
class hats had their initial appearance.
