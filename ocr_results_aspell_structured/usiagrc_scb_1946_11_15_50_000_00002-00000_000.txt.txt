LiLleral Grinhell

The Student Government Conference recently
held at Grinnell has had many interesting and
varied results. Outstanding is the fact that it has
strengthened mitlwestsrii intercollegiate ties. The
representatives came to know, understand, and
sympathize With the programs and problems of
schools much the same size as Griniieli.

The conference boosted thc morale of student
leaders by fostering, for the first time. a strong
feeling of unity in a drive toward a common
purpose and goal. Schools were here to exchange
ideas and plans as well as to discuss problems
and programs surprisingly common throughout
the Midwest.

Perhaps more important than any other rc-
sultant factor is the discovery that Grinnell takes
the lead Wth several other schools in liberalism
in social activities, men and womcn rules, and
Government constitutions.

our social organization, the Gadabouts. would
solve the social conflict problems on the campuses
of some 16 schools if it were adopted. unlike the
extensive programs on other campuses, Gadahouts
is an all school function which voluntarily includes
every student on our Campus. However, it might
not solve the social problems on such campuses
as St. Olaf, Gustavus Adolphus and William
Jewell where dancing is absolutely prohibited.

It was learned that Grinnell is one of two of
the 20 schools that does not have compulsory
chapel service sometime during the week. Com-
pulsory chapels on other campuses range from 4
compulsory chapels a week to 1 per month.
Though there are students here who miss many
fine lectures and sermons: we are ~priviledged to
'make the choice ourselves.

student-faculty relations at Grinnell are
much more progressive than they are at other
schools. Student council representatives are ac-
tive members of 5 different faculty committees
and student leaders or other student representa-
tives may request to speak to the faculty about
an issue concerning all studgnts at any faculty
meeting. On many other campuses, students are
banned from all faculty meetings and are. rarely
represented on faculty committees. Grinnell is
one of few schools which has organized an Advis-
ory Committee with the‘ President to discuss
matters that concern the welfare of the student
bod i.

)There is no doubt that we have the machinery
for one of the most progressive student govern-
ments in the Midwest, and with interested, alert
student leaders, as well as student bodies, we
should remain in the top rank.

more than twenty-five minutes in one
week. If she incurs more than thirty min-
utes at one time. she is campused for seve

en nights, including week-ends.”

For many years now the women in the quad-

rangle have been living under a minute system
the most remarkable feature of which is that
no one can understand it. There is no need to
give examples here of the difficulties which arise
evr'y year. Try to apply the above quoted passage
to an actual case. and you have your own per-
sonal illustration. If someone presumed to ask
why such a confusing system is used. the answer
would, of necessity, sound like this: The system
was set up several years ago and has been ac-
cepted ever since because succeeding Women's
League Boards found it would take less work on
their part to operate inefficiently under this sys-
tem than to take the time and effort to evolve a
new

mind of any woman student that we need a new
minute system and that the League Board is the
organization to accept the responsibility for in-
iating one.

We are happy to report that the present
League Board has accepted this responsibility and
is working right now on the instituting of an
effective end simple set of rules. Although the ac-
tual provisions of these rules have not yet been
completed, their general air is threefold:

1. to establish clearly the most practical
hours for underclass women

to do away with the giving of minutes

to place more individual responsibility
upon senior women.

Of course, the adoption of the new system will
depend upon its theoretical value and its practical
appeal for the president, administration,
trustees. But its ultimate success or failure can be
determined only by the attitudes and actions of
the student body as individuals. No system eon be
adopted which will allow any person in the COP
loge to take advantage of any other. We con—
gratulate our student goberninent on this cvie
dence of its cooperation with our interests
