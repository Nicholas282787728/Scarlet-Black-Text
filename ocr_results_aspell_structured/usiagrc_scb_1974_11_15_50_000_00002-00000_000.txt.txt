REPORT TO THE STUDENTS.

 

The Student Government Association, because of its deep in-
volvement in the presidential selection process, has been unable to
fully Comment to the students on the structure and progress of the

search.

From the beginning, students and iaculty were included in the
deliberations oi the trustee presidential search subcommittee. Over
three hundred candidates were reviewed by the committee, the vast
majority being rejected by unaminous decisions. Student, laculty and
trustee representatives were sent to both coasts to interview the top
candidates. Upon the recommendation oi these representatives, six
candidates were interviewed on campus.

A iinal search committee meeting was held on Saturday, November
2. again with student, faculty and trustee representatives, At that
meeting the trustee representatives asked both the students and the
iaculty ior a list ol acceptable candidates, Both student and iaculty
committees agreed that Dean Walker was an acceptable candidate.
They also agreed that A. Richard Turner might become acceptable,
but only upon iurther investigation, The student and iaculty
representatives agreed that this investigation would have to include a
visit to the Middlebury campus to iurther observe Mr, Turner and to
obtain additional iniormation about his periormance. The students
and iaculty believed Dean Walker to be the stronger candidate at that
point. The trustee representatives presumably conveyed the views oi
the subcommittee to the Board oi Trustees in a closed session on

November 3rd.

During the next week and a halt, neither the student nor iaculty
representatives were iniormed oi any relevant action. This led to the
beliei that Dean Walker had been or would be selected, and that the
procedural details were being resolved. it was assumed that if Mr.
Turner was to receive iurther consideration, student and iaculty

representatives would be notified.

Yesterday, the student component oi the search committee was
shocked and disappointed by the trustees’ appointment of A. Richard
Turner to the presidency oi Grinnell College. The student represen»
tatives wished the opportunity to iuther question Mr. Turner about his
perceptions oi the college and its problems. We now ieel that we were
deliberately misled as to the intentions oi the trustee subcommittee.
We ieel that the subcommittee decided previous to the Saturday
subcommittee meeting that Dean Walker would not be an acceptable
candidate and intentionally led us to believe that he was being given
serious consideration. Should our perceptions be accurate, we believe
the trustees' action to be an insult to both Dean Walker and to the
studentrtaculty component oi the committee.

We regret that the selection process was not conducted more
responsibly. but despite the above reservations, we ieel it imperative
that the college community give Mr. Turner its complete cooperation

Respectlully submitted,

Election analysis

Democrat

By Matt Cohen
Political Reporter

In the days heiore this last
election, Gerald Ford travelled
around the country decrying the
DCmOCrath Congress, suggesting
that election of Democrats would
result in even more inﬂation, and
asserting that a “vetmpl‘oof”
Congress would result in the
downiall oi the tworparty system
In the days after the election,
working from the goundwork he
had already laid, he placed the
responsibility ior solution oi our
problems in the next two years
squarely at the ieet oi the
Democrats. And the Democrats, in
the name of Robert Strauss, the
Democratic National Committee
chairman, accepted the burden
with courage.

And it was courageous indeed,
ior two years lrom now‘, ii the
Democrats have not produced
signiiicant initiatives on the
domestic front, they will be in the
position the Republicans are in
today: being constantly on the
dcfcnsive, as they are attacked for
the polic s ior which they are held
responsible,

It is questionable as to whether
the Democrals should be held
responsible or can muster the
votes to provide the legislation
necessary to maintain their ad
vantage.

This numerical mayority can not

the Democratic Party has not been

past few years, Increasingly, the
Southerners have been voting with
the Administration against the
liberals The liberal Republican
vote is not sufficient to counr
terbalance this shitt.

Democrats Divided

But evcn the block of liberal
Democrats is not divided. A survey
by The National Ollscncr of 90 of
52 ireshmen Congressmen ine
dlcatcd that they did tend to be
younger and more liberal than
their predecessors. However, when
que ‘tioncd about their positions on
speciiic legislation, they were not
at all in agreement. For example,
77 expressed theoretical support oi

However, on the issue of \vhethcr
the Government or private in-
surance companies should have
“the leading role." 27 favored the
Government, 21 favored the

be a liberal majority in name. but
there is not a viable liberal

Third and Fourth Parties

iurther is the possibility ior third

On the Republican side, there is
great disenchantment among
conservatives about Nixon's

party leader and about such issues
as amnesty ior drait dodgers. '
Reagen has already hit the cam-
paign trail, unofficially, of course,
and there is some chance that he
will run outside ol the party,
possibly with George Wallace,

On the Democratic side, Eugene
