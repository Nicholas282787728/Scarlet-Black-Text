SHALL WE PUSSYFOOT?

“Take it easy, and you’ll last longer." This
advice, so often heard in college, is esper
cially applicable to a student paper: People
are inclined to take pleasure in listening to
gossip, ”inside information," and even the
truth, about other people; and yet, when it
affects them personally, puts them in a bad
light, or as the shoe begins to pinch, the
foot becomes “hot” and they howl.

“You should be a booster, not a knock
er,’ we are told. “Why can’t you tell of the
favorable thing's instead of airing all of the
dirty linen? Don’t you realize that you are
alienating your support and undermining
your status on the campus by sucll actions '1”

Our answ 5 this: Yes, we know that
we probably “ill last longer if we take it
easy. We also know that we will be better
liked it we constantly tell you how good you
are. However, it is our s‘ e belief that
it is much better for all c ism to be open
rather than surreptitious. Constant sniping
under cover is often more destructive than

all open attack.

Yes, we know we’ll last longer if we
take it easy; but to other groups and “in,
stitutions" on the campus, might we suggest
you’ll last longer and be held in greater
esteem if you can take it. It is false 59.
curity to be merely existing, taking it easy,
stirred only by perfunctory back slapping.

Does the student body desire criticism
of things of vital concern to the future of
Grinncll college or does it wish a pussy—
footing, spineless, [acetious presentation of
the news, in reality a conglomeration of ad-
vertising copy.

Shall we air the dirty linen, or live in
an atmosphere of dankness, protected by a
shield of hypocrisy“.7

ROBERT FROST

We are likely to assume, in this specialized
civilization, that even the artist, the painter,
the composer, the poet—has his own parti<
cular job to do in his own little cornerﬁhis
own particular button to push to keep the
machinery of the world going. We are
mostly no more interested in the exact
function of art than in the exact function of
any particular lever»puller in ally particular
hosiery mill. In fact, we have scarcely
thought about art at all; we have taken it
for granted. ‘

But the poet is not supposed to be

G—

taken for granted, if he is to sewe any‘

purpose at all. He is not supposed to sit
unobtrusively in his corner; he is, as nearly
as anyone can be, a free agent, but it is not
often that he any more than any other
human being can e. st for himself. He
must have an audience if his art is to be
significant.

We are ready to assume, respecting
rather va ucly as we do the poet’s superior,
itv, that lis writing is after all intended
chiefly for scholals and his fellow artists.
But he is not really so completely an alien;
he has the power of imagination and the
sensitivity nhich we all possess. but he has
them in a greater degree. If what he has
to say means nothing to us it is likely to be
because we have given it only the cursory
attention ue give a newspaper story whi b
has been dashed off in five minutes. This is
not because poetry is necessarily obscure.
Some of the finest poetry being written to
day is notable for its clearness and simpli-
city, and for its realism; and it is some of
this poetry which he shall be hearing to
night, when Robert Frost speaks in Her ick
chapel.

We do not know too much about poetry.
But it is with sincere awe and pleasure that
we welcome Mr. Frost to the Grinnell cam-
pus.
