Kevin Costner Trapped
With No Way Out in
this 1987 Thriller

By Jason Eckert

People who lust alter Kevin
Costner’s body should definitely
see No Way Out.

Thoughgrantedthatthissrarhas
a considerable following for tllis
reason, unlike some of his other
movies, the biggest reason to see
this film is its plot.

The movie starts off as a pas-
sionate love story, and gradually,
throughsomeinterestingplottwists
arid devious characters, lums into a
healed spy novelof deception in the

Pentagon. Lead characters Costner ,

(Field nfDrenrrtr) and Gene Hack-
man (Mississippi Burning) soon
become pawns in the government
cover-up of a murder involving
Haekman‘s mistress. To further
com plicaie thesituation, Costner is
also established as the deceased's
secret lover. The Pentagon creates
a fictitious Soviet spy to cast blame
upon her death, and the chase is on
to catch the supposed Russian see
cret agent working in the Pentagon.

The movie never lets up and is
non-stop suspense and action for

the whole two hours, encouraging
movie fans to lean farther and far
thcrtorward oulol theirseats. With
a surprising final twist, the movie
ends with a secret that will make
viewersjcave the theater in awe.

A Tribute to the late Guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan

By Eric Martin

It was already a hectic weekend;
I was in the process of movrng in, I
was working at Cowles, and I was
losing weight in my sleep from the
heat. Still,Iﬁguredl'dpull through
because things justcouldn'tget any
worse. I didn’t know then that in
two days, my favorite guitarist and
musician woulddieamostuntimely
death.

Stevie Ray Vaughan was simply
a master of the electric guitar. He
not only had incredible talent. but
he was also a very caring. humble
and gentleperson. These traits seem
tobelackingarnong many of today‘s
rock musicians, rind he was thus
extremely rare and special. In his
interviews he praised other guitar
tsts and gave tribute to his primary
blues and soul inspirations. I had
tlh" unique oppontinity to see him
in concert from the founh row. and
it was the best concert I've ever
attended.

Vaughan was born Oct. 3,1955,
the younger brother of Jimmie

Vaughan (formerly the guitarist in
the Fabulous Thunderbirds). He
learned to play at an early age and
was inﬂuenced most by the blues
guitar masters of his day, including
era. King, Buddy Guy, Muddy
Waters and Otis Rush. They in-
spired him to learn toplay guitar. In
his early 20's, Vaughan played the
bar and club 7 scene in Austin,
Texas as a member of various rock
and RB bands. By the late 70’s. he
hadfonnedthenucleusofhisband,
Double Trouble (named in tribute
after an Otis Rush song), with
Tommy Shannon on bassandChris
“Whipper” Layton on drums.
Jerry Wexler discovered
Vaughan and took him to the
Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982.
He came to the attention of other
musicians after that, and his career
beganiosteamroll. Vaughanptayed

nominated for the Best Traditional
Blues Recording Grammy and
featured original instrumentals and
stirring covers. The title track is
pure blues, and it features
Vaughan‘s outstanding guitar and
soulful vocals.

Vaughan’s second album fea-
tured more original songs which
derived from __ blues and RB clas-
sics. He also did a bold cover of
limi Hendrix’s classic “Voodoo
Chile."Vaughanreworked thesong
with the same incredible intro and
solos that Hendrix used, yet he
added his own vocals and guitar to
give it a more bluesy sound. An»
other excellent cover song on the
album is “Tin Pan Alley," a nine
minute piece with a lengthy intro
and biting lyrics. This album gained
widespread critical praise and
helped build Vaughan’s growing
audience.

On his third album, “Soul to
Soul,” Vaughan‘s compositional
skills improved, as the greatmajorr

add to the texture of the album,
rather than overshadow his own
compositions.

I saw Stevie in April in Cedar
Rapids. Itwas the most incredible
concertl've everexperienced. Even
though the show was in a large
arena. it seemed extremelypersonal.
There were no massive lighting
systems, lasers or smoke machines.
Double Trouble simply played 'ts
heart out. Vaughan was reminis-
cent of the ‘60’s performers of the
past, who just came out and played
their music, allowing it to be the
sole focus of the concert. Twice,
during “Tin Pan Alley" and
“Riviera Paradise,“ Vaughan came
over to my side of the stage, sat
down on the edge and just played.
While many guitarists decide to
prove their merit by stealing
Hendrix ’s trademark style of play-
ing their guitars behind their heads,
Vaughan came up with his own
style: heslung his guitarbehind his
back, reconnected it and played. It
was simply amazing!

While Vaughan's music will
survtvc, like all great artists he was
best experienced live. I-Iis live al-
bum shows his skill and excitement
in concert, but it is sadly not a
substitute for seeing him actually
perform. Perhaps a deserved re—
newal of interest in Vaughan‘s
music will now occur, but I t Will
not soften the impact of his loss on
themusic eommunity.The vibrancy
and fire of his talent will be very
much missed.
