mere stating of policy.

Only when the instructor is
reasonably sure' that the stusl
dent has violated the plagiarism
rule by either direct copying
or unattributed paraphrasing is
the case moved to the next
step of investigation.

This next step is consideration

by .a sub-committee cf the Com-
mittee on ‘Academic Standing.
This committee is composed of
three faculty members and
either the Dean of Women or
the Dean of Men. The Dean of
>Women sits in on cases involv—
ing women and the Dean of
Men on cases involving men.

This committee considers
the evidence and conclusion
submitted by the instructor.
All evidence is studied very
carefully. as much as five
hours being given to most
cases, and the student involv—
ed is invited to appear before
the committee.

Even if the sub-committee is
convinced that the case is one
of plagiarism, the ﬁnal decis—
ion is left up to the Committee
on Academic Standing.

By this time. the case is us-
ually conclusive one way or
the other, But the Committee
on Academic standing checks
and examines the evidence. The
student again has the right to
appear before this committee if
he so wishes. The commiltcci
then makes its decision,

According to a recent Tamil» i
ty decision the student may 1
then appeal to a special ccm- .
mitten composed of the three
members at large or the exe. l
outive council. This commit-
tee entertains appeals on the
basis of new evidence or the
assertion of improper procedc
ure.

. . l
The normal penalty is failure;

in the course. Variations of this
penalty may range from failure
in the assignment to dismissal
from school according to the‘
seriousness of the case .

R_ Homer Norton (history),
who, as Dean of the College;
was chairman of the committee
for six years, indicated that
the “seriousness" of the case
is usually determined by the
importance of the student's
work. For instance, the penalty
would usually be greater for
plagiarism on an honors pro~
ieet than for plagiarism on a
two—page class paper.

While the committee gives
careful consideration to all
iactual evidence, it does not
consider intent or “uncon-
sciousn plagiarism, Robert F. .
Voertuian leconornicsl. speak-
ing from the standpoint of an
instructor, said, “The commitr
tee must treat it as a purely
technical violation of exist-
ing rules in order to give
teeth to the code. If the Dam-
mittee considers intent or ig—
norance of the law. any stu-
dent could plead lock of in.
tent and be disposed. guilty
01' n ."

 

The question which, at this
point, remains is: how can stu-
dents make absolutely Sure
that the matter of intention
will not be a factor in the
case?

perhaps the solution would
be found it the student could be
impressed further with the far-
reaching moral implications in-
volved in stealing another's
ideas or words. Only if every.
student understood these moralI
implications would the probleml
of "unconscious plagiarism" be
entirely eliminated since, real
izing these implications, the
student would take greater carc
togzlve lhc proper credit in
papers,

This of course would be the
ideal situation. Several facul-

ty members were asked to
comment on ways in which

Forensic Team

The Grinneli debate team will

Northwestern university debate

day and runs through tomorrow,
at Evanston, lll. Tomorrow four
other Grinnell debauers will par»

Teams attending the North.
western tournament for Grin-
nell are Larry Hoffman and
John Williams, Jeananne Reis-
ter and Cameron HondershoL
Each team prepared to debate
“Resolved: that Congress have
the power to reverse the deci~

the existing system might be
improved.
Several

members

and past
committee

present
of the

lagreed that further definition of

the technical violation might
be a good thing. Norton said,
“Definition of plagiarism by
professors in the classroomi
especially in the case of fresh-
men. is a good point." How-
ever, he felt that "by the time
they are upperclassmen there
should be no definition neces-
sol-ya"

0n the other hand, there
was some feeling that such ex.
plicit detinition might lead to
a "cop-suspect” atmosphere in
the classroom

Some of the instructors said
that an honor systoni might
be the best way to settle
the whole problem. Voortnnan
said, ”An honm system is an
excellent idea. The virtue of
such a system is that the stu-
dent accepts responsibility for
the problem"

Norton thought that the stur
dents “would cooperate" with
such a system, and hc could
see ”no reason why students
should not participate in dEr
termining academic honesty
since they have much more at
lnstructors."

James H Stauss, Dean of the
College, summed up the situa
tion: “I think students should
consider how they themselves
can improve the system. This
penalty business is obviously
not the answer to the prob
lem."

Modern jazz trombonist.
J. J. Johnson, will present a
concert in Darby gym Thurs-
day evening at 8.

Johnson and his five~piece
ensemble will make their Grin-

inell appearance following num-

erous engagements in this coun-
try and abroad. These recent
appearances have included not
only an extensive European
tour but also performances at
several eastern colleges and

As a young musician in the
1940's, Johnson joined forces
with the so called “new move
ment in jazz." This was a new
and different concept in the
iazz field in which small com-
bos were becoming more and
more active.

Spurred on by increasing
interest and constant practice,
Johnson worked at developing
his technical skill to the
point that the trombone
oould be played with the agil-
ity and ﬂexibility of other
horns such as the trumpet.

TllJl
this
bone playing has been demon—

Porter's '39 Novel, “Noon Wine"
“Has Detail But Misses Deplh"

by L. Kathryn Ellis

"The work of the wl‘lter is to
enforce order on a chaos of de»
tail. The readei and critic must
dlscovor that order.“

This column, which will ap-
pear spasmodically as the in-
clination of its author dictates,
should not be presumed to be
written by a critic but by a
reader. This reader will attempt
to say something about books of
varying degrees of excellence
and ultimately to discover what
order has been imposed on the
hooks.

“Noon Wine" by Katherine
Anne Porter is a short novel
which was published in 1939.
it is remarkable for its dell—
cacy of sensual details, which
threads throughout the novel.
Miss Porter selects her words
carefully and creates exper-
ienceoble pictures. it is unforc
tunate that the thread ol de-
tails is the only real thread in
the novel.

The story lacks depth as do
its characters. Her deft char-
acterizations are good, but inl
the opinion of this reader it is
more satisfactory to see a char-
acter in action than it is to see
only a brief outline of his per-
sonallly.

since the action of the novel
depends upon the characters,
this is a regrettable lack. (One
at the joys of a fine Uterary
work is the satisfaction of ex

 

pectations aroused. When the
characters are simple diagrams
set forth by the author. the ex.
pectation to be aroused is serr
iously limited)

The action of the novel
builds up very slowly, and the
climax is stunning. it comes
swiftly and has the effect of
a well calculated knife thrust,
The shock of the climax is
momentary, h o w e v e r, since
until that time the characters
have had no real depth.
Despite the negative points
mentioned above. the novel is
lull or excellent things, if
isn't excellent as a whole, The
light structural balance which
produces irony and the fin ,
of language are the best things
in the book. The structural air
rangement has pureness of con.
trol.

The symbolism of “noon
wine", i‘.e.. “drlrtking up all
your likkcr before noon . . ,
that you was sewing for the
noon lay-off," is subtle and
pervasive,

The author displays a p
trating, although limited,
sight into her characters.

As an example of almost porn
fect control of an author over
her “chaos of details," the book
is excellent. Its simplicity is
elegant, But the novel is too
shallow to be of great import.
