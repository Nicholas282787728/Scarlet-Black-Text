matter

It there is oile thing that comes
home with unmistakable com/ice
tion to those who have watched
the old gold this fall it is the
splendid reliance it has placed on
[mm work. town has. apparently,
sacriﬁced everything (it it can be
called sacriﬁce) for the sake of
complete unity ot_action. There
seems to be not a single “star" in
her entire team. There are. it is
true, several men above average
ability on the iowa eleven; butso
subservient are they to the gener-
al plan ot attack and defense that
one sees no individualsimerely
a team In shoit. as has already
been said. Iowa has a “gang oi
pluggers.” They are content to
root and dig from kickoff to call
of time without any frills or su-
perﬂuities. and woe betide the toe
that thinks Iowa knows the mean-
ing of “quit.”

In conclusion.I trust that Grin-
nell's eleven will not be compell-

ed to encounter this proposition
with a mere handful of rosters on
the side lines. The odds in all
our contests with Iowa, at the very
best. are so heavy that no team
wearing the scarlet and black can
be expected to render a good ac.
count at itself with half-hearted
support. c. E. HARRIS. on.

“It Gi'innell defeats Ames Fri»
clay, and especially if the defeat is
by more than a narrow margin.
then it will be certain that town
will have to battle as she has not
battled before this season to hold
the honors shellas all but won."—
