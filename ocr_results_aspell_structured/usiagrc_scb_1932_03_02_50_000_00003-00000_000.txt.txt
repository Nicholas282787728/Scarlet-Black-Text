Demand Slight,

Says Professor

Collegc graduate job hunters should
know \vitllln so or 60 days just what
their chances of securing employment
are, according to G. M. Fuller, pro-
fessor in the engineering economics
department at Iowa State college
who has just returned from person
nel and office management Confer»
ences at Pittsburgh ,Pa.

“The majority of the larger com
panics are holding their breaths," he
says, "Lo see whnt trend business will

take within the next 30 or 60 days]

If business trend shows an advance.
recruiting officers will he sent out by
companies which have not yet signi»
fled intentions or doing so. If the
business trend is toward greater rec
traction, the result will be opposit

Industry Represented

Representatives of several of ﬁle‘-

nation’s large industrial concerns
were present at the meeting and out—
lined means of improving the em-
ployment situation. Bevan Lawson,
executive sales manager of the Dicta-'
phone Sales corporation, lamented
the fact that technical men are KIS-
\lally uninterested in sales work de-
spite possibilities for them there.

At the final meeting, some pro-

posed to limit the number of college.

graduates by raising the standard of
entrance requirements. c. R. Mann,
director of the American Council of

Education. pointed out that such 30-!
tion was almost impossible, cspecial-'

ly in state supported institutions. be
cause of popular opinion against such
action as discriminatory.
Lnx Uni-i] 1940

A paper, “College Graduates in
Business," read at the conference,
stated that competition Will he keen»
er in the next 10 years and that the

mediocre man will be less likely to
capitalize on his college training.

Research showed that the demand

for college graduates will be lax un-l

til 1940, altho by that time 57 per
cent of staff positions paying more
than $4,000 will be held by college
men as compared with 35 per cent in
1930. v

A sense of humor, good health, a
good voice. a pleasing personality.
good character, a healthful attitude
and a graduate who has earned at

cific skills. while they are essential
tools, are secondary to traits sought,
according to this paper.

Dates Named

Scheduled
« During April, May

Spring Affairs

Dates of all spring house parties
were announced today by Wallace
Henderson, chairmen of thc rccre
ation commitee, with halls and cot-
agcs holding their semi-annual par»
ties in groups of three, on tour dates
during April and May.

Cottages Three and Five, and Cen-
ltral cottage will hold parties April
lzs. Means, and Cottages Two and
lFonr have set their date as May 14.
‘ On May 21, Smith, rtcwson and
Gates halls will entertain. The date
for the Clark, Langan and Dibble
parties is set for May 23.

Do you third; that the Colonial hall
is worthwhile?

Jeanne Horey—Yes. I think the
Colonial Ball is worthwhile. The girls
ienjoy it, and it gives them a chance
to show the fellows that they can
lead. touAean if they 'do have to
.practice for a couple of weeks before-
hand.

Mar aunt MacGregor—The Colon—
ial ball is one of the events of the
college year to which the town people
look forward, If they can enjoy it
as much as we do, it must be worth-
while. ‘

Marion Mart—It’s one chance to
be what you want to bc.

Helen Bailey—The one night in the
year when every single girl in the
quadrangle may have a dateiand
someone dares ask if it's worthwhile!

Louine Morris—The Colonial ball
is one time in the whole school year
when all girls from every cottage
in the quadrangle can get together
and have a good time.

Elizabeth Hcrrnni'l‘he fact that
the tradition of the Colonial ball has
carried on from year to year ever
since it has been started is proof
enough that it is worthwhile. It is
always well attended by the girls_
as well as by spectators.
