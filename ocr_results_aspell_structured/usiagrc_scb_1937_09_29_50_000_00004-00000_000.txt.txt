”Much Can Be Gained"

We are glad to see the Student Council
taking concrete action on student problems.
The Student Leader conference, announced
in this issue by John Spence, is, to our mind,
of unprecedented importance to every indiv-
idual connected with this school.

In the first place, it is indicative of a
healthy attitude among our campus leaders.
Obviously the backers of this conference
have come to the realization that student

government to be successful must solve stu-'

dent problems. Now that they have realized
this, half the battle for good student govern-
ment is well.

In the second place, the plans announced
show careful planning 'and organization.
There is no indication that anyone is going
off “half cocked” on this idea, The groups
and individuals included, the organization of
the actual mechanics of the conference and
the thought used in selecting a location for
the meetings all are a credit to Mr. Spence
and his colleagues.

We think havillg the conference away
from the campus will have a. desirable psy-
chological effect in helping the members to
look at campus problems objectively.

We are wholeheartedly behind this pro~
gram. We agree with Mr. Spence that
“much can be gained by a conference of this
kind."

We are confident that this conference
will accomplish the integration of plans for
this year to the advantage of the faculty and
students alike.

The Friendliest of All

“Don’t forget our Grinnell traditions"
is an admonition frequently heard on our
campus, and it is applicable to a variety of
occasions.

“Democracy” and “friendliness” are
\vatchwords of this college, alld it. seems de—
sirable that none of us should ever forget
them. We are proud of this reputation for
friendliness that Grinnell college enjoys, and
each of us should do his part to preserve it.

An excellent opportunity for the women
to help carry the banner of good feeling
comes with the yearly Young Women’s
Christian association program of the big and
little “buddies.” During the week just past
most of the upperclass women have made an
effort to help some new girl get acquainted
and fccl at home. But it is important to
realize and to emphasize that this effort
should not stop now, just because the upper-
classmell feel their duty is finished. The
new students may need help now just as
much as they did last week.

This endeavor to be friendly need not
be confined to the women and their respec<
tive little buddies; we should all try in every
way we can to carry on the famous Grinnell
tradition and to make ours the “friendliest

college of all."

Common Sense or Regulation

0n the open forum page of the Des
Moines Register last Sunday four letters ap—
peared blaming auto accidents to excessive
Speed and suggesting a mandatory speed
limit of 35 to 40 miles per hour.

We are willing to agree that many acci-
dents are due to speed, but to say that a 35
mile per hour speed limit will solve the prob-
lem is to over simplify it. There are entire-
ly too many other factors involved.

While inattelltioll alld carelessness are
less likely to be fatal at slow speeds it is also
true that one is more likely to be inattentive
and careless under those conditions. The
very fact of the apparent safety of slow
speed gives rise to a false sense of security.

It seems more important to us to have
people drive at speeds in keeping with the
highway conditions than to set an arbitrary
limit for all places. Even 35, under some
conditions, would be foolhardy while on
some of our good highways 50 is perfectly
safe.

It all comes down to the fact that we
must use our heads alld think for ourselves
As someone has humorously said, “It’s the
nut behind the wheel that counts.”J S
The Discourteous Freshman

In days gone by, freshmen at Grinnell
have been subjected to paddling and others of
the more extreme physical punishments.
Now, while there still exists some form of
prepping for men, on the whole Grinnell‘s
first year class escapes easily from the tra-
ditional collegiate initiation.

Freshmen here at Grinnell can then feel
themselves privileged.

But there still remains the fact that
they are the youngest group on the campus
and as such owe to upperclassmen the re-
spect due seniority. There are rules of cti»
quet on all campuses which mllst govern the
actions of freshmen.

These rules should in no way serve to
create a spirit of superiority on the part of
upperclassmen. Rather, they are only rules
which any younger person in any walk of
life is expected to follow.

Such dicta include allowing all upper-
classman to precede the freshman into a room
and leaving the head of the table for an up-
perclassman.

It ill-becomes a first year man or wom-
an to monopolize the conversation of any
group in which there are older college peo»
ple. Freshmen who rudely push themselves
forward either in a line of waiting people or
ill a socially visiting group do not readily
earn the friendship of their upperclass—
mates.

Again may it be emphasized that these
rules in no way usurp the democratic spirit
prevailing on this campus.

For the first few weeks, it is difficult
for new students to distinguish upperclass-
men but courteous treatment of olle’s fellow-
classmates is never bad form. Alld the
freshmen would best follow the standard
and be safe.
