Lecturer Gives “Insule Dope” on
Conference Manners and
Methods.

“More diplomatic agreements are
made across the dinner- table uran
across the conventional green baiae
conference table," declared Prof.
George Grafton Wilson, Harvard
change lecturer, in his description of
the International Naval conference at
London in 1903 and 1909, at‘ Herrick
chapel Monday morning.

"Chatting with each Others' wives at
a reception brings the diplomats to a
speedy conciliation over a hotly dis-
puted poin

Mr. Wilson gave a first hand des-
cription of the conference, to which
he was a delegate planipofentiary of
the United States. The London con-
ference was the outgrowth of the sece
ond Hague Conference in 1007; and
wits the first international law formu-’
lating conference in the history of the
world. . The discussions centered,
around blockade, contraband, conlluur
ous voyage and all the problems deale
ing with neutral vessels in time of
War. V ‘

Accor ng to Mr. S lson, ,

, gate's dai y entrance into the confere
enee room in the British Foreign 0f—
fice in Downing Street was punctil-
iously formal and ceremonious and
his attire scrupulously correct accord-
ing to British taste. "These are very
bad habits for a democrat to get into,"
complained Mr. Wilson.

naphrins Methods

The lecturer humorously explained
how the official reports of a confer-
ence which are made public are ob-
tained, Each morning a delegate is
handed a proof sheet of the discus-
sions of the previous day. He is then
given a chance to change his speeches
to “what he would have said it he
hadn't said what he did, after hearing
what the other fellow said."

Mr. Wilson explained the dispute
between the United States and Ger—
many over the question of a “continu—
ous voyage” which threatened to
break up the conference until the King
of England called each of the two
delegations into private conference
with him. “Moon the conciliation was
reached, there were tears in the eyes
of some of the delegates who' had
feared that the conference ,would

‘ break up before reaching an agree-
ment." .

“Unfortunately, the United States
was the only nation that voted to rat—
ify the Declaration of London, The
struggle over the abolition of the
House of Lords prevented Great Brice
ain from considering- the hill right
away. In the meantime, a great deal
of absurd propaganda was stirred up
against it, and the other nations fol-
lowed suit and failed to ratify the doc-
llment." .g

Notwithstanding the immediate fail-
ure of the Declaration of London, Mr.
Wilson takes an optimistic view‘of its
work. "Progress in international
peace," he declared, ”will come only
through the formulation of laws such
as were made at the Conference at
London.” - v '-

Morris Urges Seniors to Adapt
Themselves to World.

“The problem of litting ouc's self to
the great human world in \lhich we
try " was the subject of the chapel
talk given by l‘l'uf. v. P. Morris to
the senior class on Tuesday.

“This group of people here today
consists of those who are stimulated
to thought and action, those who have
accomplished something. Not in the
goal but in the spirit and the atti—
tudes in which he approaches that
goal is man's real greatness."

Mr. Mo ' . pointed out various con-
trihntious which the college should
have made to the senior in four years.
“The greatest of these,” said Mr. Mor—
ris, “is the enlarging consciousness."

This is the first of a series of four
senior chapels. On Friday of this
u-cek, Prof. H. w. Norris will speak

Says “lVlike” Hyland.

\ ‘ .

The men in the Dorms had the priv-
ilege of hearing William Bear of Des
Moines, president of the Graduate
council, and Mike Hyland, football
coach, last night immediately after
dinner. They spoke on athletic pl'us-
pccts for next year and thc revi 'ng of
the Crinnell spirit.

“We have a good coach, a good
squad, and a good student body, but
good teams don’t always win champ—
ionships anymore. They must he
more than good. They must repre<
sent the supreme sacrificevsomething
coming straight from the heart—in
order to Win,” Mr. Bear said.

Mike Hyland advanced the plan of
organizing next year’s prepping into
a system by which the freshmen would
do the mental work of the squad, so
that they can give every ounce of
strength to the task of producing a

football season which all Srinnellians‘

will be proud to remember.

“Their enthusiasm {or

PREPS EXPECTED

Dope Gives Local Freshmen Edge
Over M. V. Prep Stars.

On account of the extremely cold
weather her-e, the events that were to
he run off in the Freshman Telegraph-
ic Meet yesterday were postponed, and
will be run off to-Iyly and to-rnorrow,
if the weather permits.

Grinnell has some stellar track men
among her freshmen this year, and
should be able to turn in as good time
or better than the majority of Missouri
valley schools in several events. Cap-
titin Riliefort is one of the best prep
discus throwers in the conference, and
Boettger and Meeter- can put the shot
with the best of them. )

Rincfort is also a good century man,
and with Hays running the 220, New:
ion and Hays in the 440. Gould in the
half mile and mile, Nihlo and Patton
in the hurdles, and Van Schrader high
jumping, Coach Rogers sqllftd should
make a creditable showing.

Applicants for Financial Help
Must Stay at Grinnell or
Refund Money.

From the office of the registrar

comes an announcement of a.
change in policy in the granting of
student aid scholarships, which will
be of interest to those contemplating
application for such aid.
, As the donors of funds used for
student aid are attempting primarily
to advance the interests of Crinnell
college, it is felt that those who leave
Grinneil before the completion of'
their course should have less oppor-
tunity for assistance than those who
.stay in Grinnell for their entire col—
‘legiate work. Consequently, each
student receiving aid will be asked to
sign the following agreement:

"In consideration of the aid extcude
ed me by Crinnell College, I promise,
in case I transfer to another institu-
tion before I graduate from Grinnell.
or in case I am asked to withdraw
from‘ Grinnell College on account of
poor work or misconduct, to pay to
Crinnell College the amount granted
herewith, which amount becomes due
on the date of transfer or withdrawal."

Similar rulings, regarding student
aid are common in colleges and unis
vcrsities throughout the country, and
it has been adopted here with the in-
tention of keeping faith with those
who donate funds for the advancement
of the interests of Crinnell.

Dope on Competitors Is Vague—
Local Team Expected to
Show Up Well.

The Pioneers will get the real test
of the season when they go to Aches
to enter the Iowa State Meet this ‘
weck end. The squad has been rapid ,
ly rounding into shape, and barring
accidents, “Doc” an should have a
strong teanr on the field Saturday.

Fast competltion is expected in ev—
ery event, so it is difficult to predict
just what Crinuell will be able to do.
It is almost certain that Taylor can
he depended upon to place in the hur-
dles, although he will have .fast come
pany to run against in Crawford of
Iowa in the highs, and Bl'oukins, Iowa
captain, in the lows. Green has been
steadily improving in both the high
and low sticks, and it is expected that
he will qualify, and possibly place.

Dashes Ulwcl'lilill

"he dashcs are the most uncertain
events of all,.as there are no sprinters
in the state of the class that there has
been the last few years, and the Grin-
nell men have as good a chance as
any of placing. Julies' foot will prob—
ahiy be in good shape by the end of
the week, and if he doesn't have to
run against a strong wind, the midget
Pioneer sprinter should do well.
Scharnwcber is better in the fur-long
than in the shorter dash, and from the
race he ran against Young of Drake
last week, he also should be among
the point winner

In the ouarte mile, Coach Huff has
Kitchen, M. Jones, Stotts. and Gillette,
any one of whom may place. Captain
McIlrath and Porter will take care of
the hall, and will show Hammeriy of
Ames some keen competi 'on in that
event. Porter won his spurs by come
ing‘np from behind and taking second
in the 880 in the State Meet last year,
and it is hoped that he will be able to
produce again this year.

The Pioneers will he weakest in the
field events, although Doge should
take points in both the shot and diSe
cus, and Duke will probably place in
the javelin throw, as 'he is becoming
more and more proficient .wlth the
spear. Taylor and Boge will probably
do the high jumping, although Taylor
may be kept out to save him for the
hurdles. Critchett’s foot is still too
sore to expect much from him in the
pole vault and broad jump, although
should it heal, he will probably place
in these events.

nreitenhnch May lion

It is hoped! that Breitenbach will el—
so he in condition to wear the spikes
Saturday. and in that case the Pioneer
squad will have two milers of ability,
as Howard ran an excellent race
against lilake last week. Meyer will
show up well in the tlvomﬁlc, and
should take at least second as Phelps
of Iowa has the best records for the
long distance event. ,

Grinnell also has a good chance to
garner points in the relay The half—
lilile~tettm, composed of L, Jones,
Scharnweher, M. Jones, and Taylor
negotiated the distance in the fast
time of I:29.7. and the mile team with
Kltclleil, M. Jones, Slotts, Gillette or
Mcllrath carrying the baton, should
put up a good race for any team.

CYCLOWEDITOR
HAS TURNED CLAM

Leaders of 1925 Annual Staff
v Refuse to Be Pumped.

Although no ’dEfiuitc information
can be gleaned from the silent Cy—
clone strtll, a persistent rumor yer—
vades the campus that the annuals
will appear this week. The Scarlet
and Black reporter has gone the!»
origth into the report and concludes
that the student body will do well to
he on the lookout for something or
other unusual. The editor attempted
to steal it march on the school by rc-
por-tirrg that the book has been un—
duly delayed in the print shop because
:of some mishap, but it has been pro—
vcn that this is merely a rose to fool
the student body.

The ‘editor and business manager
were both waylaid by the alert i'e<
porter yesterday but all that he could
.gct out of them was the following
statement, "Better pay for your Cy-
clore now it you haven’t already done
so, as you wont get it otherwise."
