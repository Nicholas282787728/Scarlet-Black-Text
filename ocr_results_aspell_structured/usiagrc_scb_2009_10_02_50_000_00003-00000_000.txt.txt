Local foods spend a night in the JRC

Local farmers voice their opinions on the amount of local produce presented In the dining hall for students consumption

ThIs pnstTIIesdny, GrInnclI DIIIIng sch/Ices held II Local
Food Night at the DInIIIg Hall exhibiting locul foods troIn lo—
cal farmers.

Dean Porter ’10, A former Intern for the Grinnell Area Lee
cal Foods Alliance (GALFA), believes that the Local Foods
Night was a step In the right direction toward bringing more
local Ingredients to the dining hall.

“I know that they cant make that level of food everyday,
but even [byljust Integrating more local Ingredients on a regu-
lar basis, I think that people would be more cchred about the
food,” Porter said.

For other peer Institutions In the nation, incorporating local
foods Into their plans has been a longnterrn commitment.

Luther College, for example, located In Decorah, Iowa, has
Implemented in plan with a goal orpurchaslng 35 percent orIts
food from local foods. Since the plan was enacted, Luther’s lo»
cal food purchases has Increased lsychht percent and currently
purchases from approIanIarer 17 local farmers, all which are
located within a 100emile radIus ofthe college’s campus.

An additional unchIsIty who has almost fully Incorporated
local foods into Its menu Is Iowa State University (ISU). Aer
cording to the ISU Dining Service Website, the Institute aims
to have at least 35 percent of their food dollars spent on lo-
cal food by 2012.15U plans to serve All Iowa Meal In all of
their residenrlal dining centers by this point in time, as well as
increase the awareness of the importance or purchasing local,
organIc and sustaInable food. ISU, with 20,000 students, has a
larger student body than GrInncIl, yet still manages to have a
higher percentage orlocal foods present In their food procurc~
menr.

DespIte the large amount of local produce purchased by
larger institutions such as EU and Luther, Assistant Director
orDInIng Services Terry Waltersdort’helleves that sourcIng ade
dItIonal food from local farmers would be a nearly impossible
feat.

“Most of the farmers In the area that grow what we can
use are very small,"WaltersdorI'said.”A ton of them are tied to
CSA [Community Supported Agriculnire] shares...we bought
a couple of CSA [shares] to see how we use would themIThe
only thing we could do with it Is cater. [The farmers] don’t
want us buying 200 shares."

However Andrew and Melissa Dunham of Grinnell Heri-
tage Farm disagree

“I know that {or us, if Grinncll wanted to purchase Like

$15,000 worth of greens... if they could make that commit
ment, we would certainly be able to fulﬁll that,"Mrs. Dunham
said. “We would just need that commitment in advance.“
Though Grinnell Dining Services has Increased tthr
"local" purchases by 41.73 percent sInce the beginning of the
2005—2006 academic year, some erll behave that the college can
do more to incorporate a larger amount of locally grown pro—
duce Into the food eaten every day by students.
“I know that Kenyon College and Ohio and Green Moun—
taIn College In Vermont are doing an awful lot of local foods

in their timing halls,” Mr. Dunham said. “Ifsomeone were to...
challenge Grinnell in what they are doIng [In the dInI-ng hall],
they wouldn't be looking very good."

A major reason that these peer institutions are able to have
such a large percentage of tthr food he local is due to the
employment of a sustaInaoIlIry coordInator. Though GrinneLl
lacks this paid posItIon as a part of'Its Dining Services Staff, a
Local Foods Intern position was created with the guidance of
Porter approximately a year ago.
