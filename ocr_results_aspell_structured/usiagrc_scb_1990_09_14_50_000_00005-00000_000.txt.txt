Coordinators Emphasize
Having Fun in IM Sports

By Daniel Bliss

“Fun is thekey word,“ said Barb
Duffrin, joint Intramural Sports
coordinator. With tltat in mind, the
IM sports season kicked off on
Monday, and it appeared that par-
ticipation was very strong.

Duffrin and fellow lointrCoor-
dinatorScotrTruesdelihave brought
some changes to the program, but
one major change that was expected
has not occurred. The proposed
rule change mandating co-ed teams
has notheen formally adopted. “For
the most pan, people were pretty
supportive (of the notion ofa cored
mle).” said Duffrin. But the plan
was eventually dropped because it
would not be right to mandate par-
ticipation in IM‘s in any way.

Duffrin added, however, that the
idea of cored sports has been
strongly advanced by this episode,
and that so far the level of particir
pation by women has improved.
The key thing, she argued. was that
it has changed people's attitudes
for the better.

Truesdell detailed the one major
change that is in effect: There will
now no longer be a ntnning tally of
points carried over from one sport
to the next. Itwas felt that this was
making the spons too competitive
for certain residence halls and tak-
ing the fun out ofthem. From now
on, there will only be winners in
individual spons. These may be
“acknowledged" in some way or
other, but how this will happen re-
mains to be seen.

Other possible changes in the
pipeline include the addition in the
spring of inter-dorm swimming and
track meets, and the inclusion of
Hall Activity Coordinators in the
organization of 1M sports. Soccer
will reutm to the schedule this fall
atter a one year absence caused by
the late start of the Ultimate season
last year. As for the new dining hall
hours, they are considered “un-
likely" to affect the 1M program.

Duffrin and Truesdelladdedthat
they would like to see more volun-
teers for refereeing this year. Ala
though varsity and JV players are
welcome, they emphasized that
anyone who has a reasonable
knowledge of the rules of a game
can referee and should consider ap.
plying forajob.

“Our group is concerned with
what some have termed the Poles
tinian diaspora, as well as other
related issues,” said Tanweer
Akram. a member of the Palestin-
ian Human Rights Campaign-
Grinnell. This “diaspora" and the
continuing Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip will be
foremost among the concerns of
the PHRC in its second year of
existence on campus.

Thegroup,whichcurrentlycon-
sists of around l0 members, meets
weekly on an informal basis to ad—
dress Palestinian issues and con-
cerns. As a chapter of a larger
intemational organization of the
same name, the Grinnell group also
has access to new information on
the changes in the Palestinian up
rising in the Oc-
cupied Territo-
ries. the lntitada‘
and on new re-
ports of human
rights violations

‘The focus of
the PHRC-Grin-
nell is to raise the
level of cone
sciousness on
campusztboutthe
violation of Pal»
estinian human rights, to provide a
fontm for discussion and debate
and to support the Palestinian
people'srighttoselfrdetennination
in their homeland," said group
member Dina Shali, Aktam added
that the group also strongly sup-
ported United Nations Security
Council resolution 242, which de
mands Israeli withdrawal from the
Occupied Territories.

Campus response to the Pales-
tinian issue has not been as enth usi-
astic as hoped by PHRC ormuell
members, despite their effons to
publicize human rights abuses in
the region. “Last year we tried to

nity on the issue of Palestine by
showing documentaries, engaging
speakers and distributing a news
letter. Unfortunately we have been
unable to get substantial response
from campus,” said Rafi Ahmed.

Student reactions for the most
part coniln'n Ahmed’s assertion.
“The issue of Palestininan human
rights is not that imponant to me
because we [the United States of
America] have enough problems
herethatwe havetodeal with ﬁrst."
said Adam Schoebelein.

Alcram expressed dismay atwhat
he saw as the disregarding and dis-
missive attitude with which the
subject of Palestine is often ap-
proached. “If one is to believe in
human rights for all people there is
no way to legitimately disregard

. one should be equally concerned
with the human
rights of the
Aborigines in
Australia, the

Some of the
students in the
groupexpressed
skepticism as to
whether the
troubles in the
Occupied Territories could easily
be resolved. Jenny Tsar-lg telt that
much of what she heard from other
students on the issue was far too
idealistic. “There isjust too much
hatred in the region to make peace
possible in the near future,‘ she
added.

But Rina Khan expressed hope
that the renewed American interest
and involvement in the Middle FJSI
as a result of the iraqi invasion of
Kuwait could lead not only to in-
creased concem about the human
rights violations in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, but also to the rose
