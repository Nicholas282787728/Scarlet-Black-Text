Lawrence Sla’red
As Winning Team ‘

Grinnell‘s track squad goes in-
to action today at Northfield,‘
Minn, whereCarletoncollege plays
host to the 24th annual Midwest
Conference track and field meet.
Preliminaries are scheduled for‘
today and final runnoffs for Sat-‘
urday.

Dope sheets cast the role of
favorite upon the shoulders 01
defending champions, Lawrence
college. but many experts give
the Pioneers a fine chance-to
take the trophy. mt year, a
ﬁve-man Grinnell squad anuw
ed 13 points. good enough for
eighth position among the nine
league members.

Several records are pcriled this
year, especially the 220-yard dash
record of ;21.5. John Bonyata,
Grinnell‘s super-dash man. is rated
top speedster in the conference,
and With severe competition might
make the grade. Greg Newell will

‘be pushed by Ripon's Charles
Shepard and Carlewn’s Jerry
Shean in the high and low nur-
dles. Greg will be out to lower
the mayoral high hurdles stand-
art! of :15 flat.

Coach 1n- Simone concedes
that his freshman relay team
has an 'cven opportunity to
break the conference mark in
the mile rclny which now stands
at 3:23.s. The team, consisting
of Bill Ben-y, Bill Boumo, Steve
Himhcock, and John Bonyata
has been hard at practice in the
batmrpnssing event for the past

their pet indhiduﬁl events.
Bouma will face Dick F10m,l
Lawrence defending champion, in,
the open tan-yard dasir. Flom
won last spring in the excellent
time of 51.6, but Beuma bettered
that mark in the recent Carleton
dual meet.
