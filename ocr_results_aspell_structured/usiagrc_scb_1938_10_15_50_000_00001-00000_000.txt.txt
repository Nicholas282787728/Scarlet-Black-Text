By Duane McAheney
"hrchiecture is the very backbone
of civilization," asserted Frank
Lloyd Wright, noted architect, in
his lecture in Herrick chapel
Thursday evening.

‘iArchitectul'e is a spirit of be-
ing. Buildings should be loving
and have character. My stru
tures come closest to that ideal
Wright said.

Using the Roman arch as an ex-
ample, Wright maintained that
tradition has kept us from moving
forward in architecture. An archi»
tect should interpret the life of
the people, and this modem archi-
tects fail to do.

“Their designs,” Wright pointed
out, “arc of the age of the R0-

He accused modern buildings of
being false and lacking in integ~
rity, through too much similarity.
There is little expression because
one building is just like the next
one.

According to Wright, our tech
nological world has outrun the
man with the idea. The result is
unemployment and a cultural lag.

In regard to his own buildings,
he stated that in each of his 227
structures he faced reality. and
his designs came closest to the
ideal that should be sought in mode
ern architecture.

“I am interested in building as
an expression of life and not for

money,” Wright emphasized in
conclusion.
