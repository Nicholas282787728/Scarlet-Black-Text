‘Hol’ Dancing
Exhibited by Dancers
at May Day Program
\

“Hot" dancing in every sense of
the word was exhibited at the
Women's annual May Day pro-
gram Thursday evening. Mr.
Walter Camryn and his dancing
partner Miss Louise Shott came
back stage in Rand gymnasium
dripping with pei-sipiration to be
interviewed after giving three
encores.

“Underneath the Harlem Moon,"
their final number, is a combi-
nation of authentic negro steps,
he declared. “But my real spe-
cialty is character dancing, like
the "Bavarian Village dance" and
“Turkey in the Straw," Mr.
Camryn stated, These two were
danced in eccentric costume with
a great deal of spirit and pan-
tomine.

“We have just come from 40
weeks of exhibition dancing at
the Hotel Bismarck in Chicago,"
Mr, Camryn said. wiping his brow.
He and Miss Shott have danced
together at intervals for the past
seven years, part of the time
with the Chicago Civic Opera
ballet.

Mr. Camryn studied under Adolf
Bolm in Chicago, and Miss Shott
received her first training from
Novikoff, Mr. Camryn is now
an instructor in ballet at the Mary
Kane School of the Dance in oak
Park, Ill. He is also the only
teacher in the city with classes
in exhibition ballroom dancing, he
said.

Moore Explains
Public Service
at Vocations Class

Lyman Moore of the Public Ad-
ministration Clcaring house, Chi-
cago, Ill. led a panel discussion on
the vocational opportunities in
public service at the last meeting
of the vocations class. Friday af-
ternoon. other members of the
panel were Mr, John Millar. organ-
izer of the class. and Pres, John S.
Nollen. Prof. John P. Ryan pre-
sided as faculty chairman. and
'Richal'd Drake '36, was student
chairman.

Mr. Moore, an associate of Louis
Brownlow, who was scheduled to
speak, explained that public ser-
vice is a non-partisan system of
governing which is gradually be-
coming effective in county, state,
and national organizations,

This civil service arrangement,
he stated. offers unlimited oppor-
timities for college students in
scientific, professional, and admin-
istrative careers. In naming the
qualities necessary for positions in
public service, Mr. Moore placed
first the ability to analyze complex
problems and to synthesize their
significant elements. But of al-
most equal importance, he contin-
bed, is the ability to make rapid
and intelligent decisions, to develop
new ideas and methods, to deal
with the public and to lead an or-
ganization. Few- college gradu-
ates, Mr. Moore declared, have all
these qualities well-developed, but
if they have a capacity for intellect
and a willingness to expand their
abilities the chances for success
and progress are good.

Mr. Moore considered a liberal
arts education satisfactory prepa-
ration for public service in gradu-
ate woi-k or professional education,
for junior posts with staff agen-
cies. secretarial work with admin-
istrators, and foreign service.

In conclusion Mr, Moore advised,
“1f going into public service go
now, but don't jump at it without
full appreciation of its require-

ments and carcer obstacles. There
is no royal road to a career in any

is no exception. The opportunity

Student Self-Government
Declining Trend Shows

Norfolk, vas (ACPJ~Student
self-government, once the object
of many a hard-fought battle with
administration heads, is not so
important to American colleges
today, and some observers profess
to believe that lack of interest
will finally cause it to die out.

The College of William and
Mary, Norfolk division, is the
latest to drop‘ its governing
body. The men's student senate
resigned in a body recently, with
the statement that ‘lack of stu-
dent problems has made these
offices impracticable,"

No substitute body will be ap-
pointed, it was indicated.

Smith, Gates Divid‘e
Tennis Matches

Gates and Smith tennis teams
divided honors in two matches
played in the intramural tennis
race this week.

Robert Berry of Smith defeated
Kaplan, Gales, 6-3, 6-1. Charles
Bower and Robert Irwin, Gates,
overcame Paid Carlson and Ran-
dolph Carlson, Smith, 6-2, 6-3 in
the doubles play.

Edward Harvey. Rawson, de-
feated Howard Tullis, Clark
singles player. 7-5, 7-5, in another
hard fought match. Doubles have
not yet been played.

The deadline on second round
matches has been lengthened due
to the recent rains.

The University of Pennsylvania
had a “fault-finding" day recently.
Everyone aired his pet gripes, but
knockers claimed nothing was done
about any of them.

The belief that lett-handed per-
sons are slightly abnormal, says
Dr. Samuel T. Orton of Columbia,
is just another piece of folk-lore.
