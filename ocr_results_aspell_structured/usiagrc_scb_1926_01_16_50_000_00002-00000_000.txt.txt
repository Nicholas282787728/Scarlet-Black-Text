ANOTEEE ALIEN EXPOSED

Unmasking Santa Claus to make
him comply with a state law, was a
hundred per cent American act which
a Klan performed in a Western city,
during the holidays.

Coming from the North Pole, Santa
could not be called a citizen of this
country and the Klan was right in
placing him under suspicion. or
course there is always the lurking
danger that a foreigner or a Catholic
might be taking advantage of the st.
Nick attire to collect money to buy
guns for the basement of a church.

saute is often "red" in his views and
if the Klan could get him to Europe
perhaps the state department could
be induced to consider him an unde—
sirable alien along with Countess Kar
rulyi. Surely some mistake could be
found in his passport.

To be thorough in the suppression

SPEED CDI’S NEEDED FOR DIS-
CUSSION GROUPS

College students have a habit of
wanting to do everything at once or
not at all. and often they come to de—
cisions without facts as a basis.

pus social lifc, religion, and college
athletics. it is doubtful whether small
groups who have had no special prep-
aration can reach at final decision in
a. short time. After all, should they
decide anything when they may not
be representative of general student
opinion? Last week a. group decided
that the college needed more ting
dances, and more tag dances it tried
to have. Saturday night. Probably if
the truth were known very few at the
dance favored the tagging.

Editor of the Scarlet and Black,

Dear Si

May I assure tliose of your rcaders
who believe that ours is an unrunratic
age. fliut although ruin-runners ‘dle
the only men who now carry on the
u ork of Captain Kidd on the high
sens, we have with us in Grilmell col-
lege the book pirate who is still true
to the romantic conception of his her
farious craft.

An appeal had been made previously
to both the conscience and sense of
fairness of these library brigauds.
but in spite of this the rnpacity of

ed. and their latest foray has been
directed against the newly
books which regularly repose on a
table on the first floor of the library.

Many boakrlovers who have taken
advantage of the opportunity courte—
yously provided by the library author--
ities to glance at the incoming books
before they are released for general

lfrorn the shelf. 0n questioning a
ilihral'iztn they have received the locus-
tio reply: "on. some one has stolen
itt"

One enlightening factor
with the disappearance of books is

if there is no latent gentility to be.

Reverend H. 0. Rice of the Baptist
church spoke at Chapel on Friday
‘morning on the present crisis in relig-
ion, He discussed the modern theo<
logical views from the standpoint of
tprdctical Christianity.

Reverend Rice stated that in the un.
certainty and unrest of the present
day world criticism comes easily.
Model-n church methods are under
‘fire from every side. The recent
lChurch conference in Chicago demon-
strated the fact that religion is losing
its force under the strain of heated
(:Huutlovelsy. Rev. Rice met this site
nation by saying that there is a move—
.ment on foot which might be termed
the “back to Jesus" trend. that by ig~
lnuring the scientiﬁc and theological
criticisms and recognizing in Jesus
the essence of all religion any where.
the religious crisis may be rust and
‘faith stabilized once more.

Mabutme Ghandi, the outstanding
leader of thought in India advises a
return to the teachings of Jesus. "We
must lift the fog of controversy and
take this rugged simple mall. the em»
bodimcnt of the teachings of right liv»
ing. as an example to follow in life,’
said Rev. Rice. “We must come back
to this kind of interpretation of relic
since the whole point of it is
missed in interpreting religion in
terms of doubt. and theology. straight-
forward, moral. ethical living is a re
ligion.”

i

I

In the future religion will be inter»
preted in terms of living. Jesns' con-
fribufion was his life. he proved that
man can live decently, finely and lies
ruicully.

“The present crisis in religion."
concluded Rev. Rice, “can be settled
by turning back to this Man of Name
reth. We should face life’squal‘ell',
honestly. with the inspiration of this
Man and dare to live. If we do this
we shall solve the present religions
crisis.” \
