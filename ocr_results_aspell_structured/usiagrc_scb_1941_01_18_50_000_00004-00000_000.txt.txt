By Jack Wile.

Gl'innell’s angel‘s will invade
the Drake fieldholise in Des
Moines tonight for a non-
confel'ence tilt with the Bull—
dogs.

The Drake quintet, sparked by
wee Walter O’Connor, Jay Cox,
and Lloyd Milboum, will be out
to improve their previously un-
impi-essive record by downing the
Pioneers. The Bulldogs won their
first three games of the season,
but then plunged into a four-game
losing streak that included an
unprecedented tworgame trouncing
by Iowa state. Last weekend,
Drake bounced back into the
winning column by bowling over
St. Louis, 40 to 25,

Open With Victories.

The Pioneers, under the men-
torship of Ben Douglas, have
been traversing their first few
games under very much the same
circumstances. Opening their sea-
son with Victories over Monmouth
and Knox, thc Grinncll tive then
hit rough going and dropped
games to s. W. Louisiana Inst,
iowa, and Cornell. in that order.

Last week, however, they recov-
ered ti-om their slump and smothr
ered Knox. 51 to 34.

Main thrcat to bc furnished by
the Bulldogs will be O‘Connor,
veteran guard, who has led his
teammates in victories over Grin-
nell for the past two years. Small
and exceptionally tast, the tiny
sharpshooter has always been a
problem to the Pioncer detense,
At a torward position we find an-
other marksman, Milboiirn, who is
high point man on the Drake five,
Grim-ell improves.

Gl'innell’s quality of play has
improved with each game that
has been played this year. COv
captain Gene Peisner, veteran for

along with the rest of the team.
Peisner has been invaluable to
the game as a defense man, but
the tact that he's hitting now will
make him a double asset, Paul
Patterson, who we hope will be
able to keep O‘Connor under conr
trol, will also he a big booster in
the scoring column.

Patterson is leading the team
scoring With an average of over
12 points per game, Ralph Young-
strom, valuable reserve forward,
will not be with the squad due
to a back injury he received last
week,

Probably starting tor Crinnell
will be Co-Capt. Peisner and Pat
terson at the forward positions,
Hugh McCartney at center, and
Co-Capt.Jcrry Fort and Harold
“Hap" Kendall in the guard spots.

Knox defeated Cornell, 34 to 30,
and then dropped games to Grin—

37-33, respectively.

Lawrence, this year's dark—horse
01' the league, has turned in wins
over Col-ncll, Beloit, and Ripon.
The game With Ripon was a close
one, with the Lawrence five on
the na ow top of a 33-31 score.

The Pioneers wul defend their
second place position against
Carleton here Monday night. Do.
spite their position in the confer-
