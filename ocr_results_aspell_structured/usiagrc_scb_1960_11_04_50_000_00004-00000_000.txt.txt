CotHP Meets
With Krohnke

D u a n c Krohnkc, Stutlcnt
Council president, met witii the
its meeting in_Bur-
ling library Tuesday evening
to discuss roccnt problems-.a-
rising between those two can
pus govci-ning bodies.

The purpose of the discussion,
which was cut short hcrorc any
solutions could be agreed upon,
was to “attempt to bring about
some understanding bctwcen the
Student Council and the COI—
HP," according to Camp head
Gary Knamille~.

The issue which gave immedi-
ate rise to recent trictioii bc-
tivcen the two groups was an
unprecedented Student Coun-
cil'budget program not award-
ing the Coll-[P its usual semes-
ter’s working fund on a north
campus per capita has . The
CotHP was asked to anticipate
its expenditures and then pre-
scnt a request rather than {Er
ccivc a pl‘erset amount.

It Was decided that solving
or problems such as this can
only he acconipli hed through
better communication between
the campus governing bodies.
Krohiike proposed "better cir-
culation oi the student Coun-
cil newsletter as a means or
iurthering understanding."

Agreeing that more time was
needed ior discussion of inter-
campus government activities,

‘the Coil-1P proposed setting up

iuturc ColHF-Studcnt Councll<
AwS Board discussion meetings.

Following the discussion a
motion was passed to the eiicct
that a committee oi three men
