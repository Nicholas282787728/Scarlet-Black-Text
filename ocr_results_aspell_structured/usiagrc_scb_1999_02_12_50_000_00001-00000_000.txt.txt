According to fotnretsrARc business man.

for such a change may be the growth in the

we didn’t have that many publications," said
Willis.

“There were people who trekked for

dent activity fees. of this $259,000, about
73 percent goes to the student Government
Association, while the last 27 percent _abont
$70,000 this yearrgoes to SPARC.

Last semester, however, the eight media
entities—includingKDic and Tire Creature—
established individual bndgets that would col-
lectively send them $12,000 over this yearly
limit, However, because former SPARC chair
ivy chang ’01 (who recently resigned rtom
SPARC for personal reasons) and Willis were
still unsure about the exact amount and allo-
cation of student activity fees, and because
they also expected the usual support from the
treasurer, the SPARC members approved the
budgets.

relietsupplics and political maneuvering
done by Nicaragua's President, Arnoldo

all foreign aid coming into the country.

Despite being away from central
America, Goldstein has remained active
on behalf of Mitch's victims. in addi.
tion to giving presentations, she and
other members of the 1mm program
spent three weeks rntidiaising and raised
almost $15,000. This money has been
given to small grass roots organizations,
Goldstein is confident this is the best
way to assist rural Nicaragunns from
abroad.

“Smaller grass roots orginirations are
the way to go They know more about
what is really going on than the govern.

said.

Goldstein is concerned that as news

of Hurricane Mitch vanishes from the
news, relief money will begin to vanish
as well.
‘ “Now is the most important time be-
cause thc hurricane is out of the news

Willis made it clear that no Creature could
not expect to function as a SPARC Pllbllczv
rion in the future Further, Willis intormed
the media heads “that [SPARC was] subst'an.
tially overbndget, and the college was no longer
going to cover the slack." Willis explained that
SPARC Funds would “pay for all last semester's
[printing cosrsi, but this semester we would
have to cutback," to meet ilre $70,000 bud-

Amy Reirer, editor OFT/1e Grrline/lRei/iew,
found the news “frustrating," said Reiter. “i
think the reasons we didn’t have enough money
were sound, .but the issue is that trio much was
assumed, ,iBudget problems werei not
brought up as a concern until the end of last
semester."

The extent to which a restricted budget
may alter the current operations ofthe radio
station and the six publications left to SPARC
is difﬁcult to determine. However, many me.
dia heads agreed that the current operations
themselves-are lacking in a number ofareas
Thus, the drive for tighter budget control
comes at a time when many students see the
need for mote—not less—spending.

“The problem is ..not having a budget
that increases with the rate orinilation in pub-
lishing," said Reitcr. Reiter noted several ar.
eas where publications could be improved, in.
eluding the facilities in the publications build.
ing. “Right now. ,.thc publications building

Reitet also-noted productions problems
that resulted from lack ofspace. “People have
