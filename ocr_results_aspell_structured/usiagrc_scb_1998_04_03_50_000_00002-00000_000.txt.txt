ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT
Celebrating the spring Morphine
with “Winterreise”

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

John Christian Rommcrcittl and
Eugene Gatlb will present
”Winterrcisc" by Franz Schubert on
Sunday, Apr-it s at 7 pm. in t-teri-ick
Chapel. “Wintcrl'cisc" is part tour of
the Chamber Music Series, which is
organized by Gaul:

Rolnlnereiin, a prolessor of mus
sic, conducts the Grinnell Singeis
and the Grinnell Community Chat us.
Gaub, an accomplished pianist, is
also a professor ol‘ music

“Wintcrreise” is a-song cycle, a
series on4 songs whtcll are loosely
connected by a single plot. The title
is German for “Winter Journey,"
which reﬂects the plot of the piece.
Rommereim will sing the role of a
lonely manjllted by a lover. He com-
mented. “If anyone has had a love
affair that has gone bad, they should
come to the concert."

Rommereim finds the “enomtous
variety ofmoods and emotion" to be
one of the highlights of the piece.
The main characterin “thlerreise,”

although cngulletl iii loneliness and
despair, also has moments of happi-
ness whctl he looks back affections
ately on his love. III other moments,
the main character descends into
what is almost insanity, finding dcr
lusion more pleasant than reality.

These varying emotions are cons
\‘eyed ill both tltc words and the
music. Roiiiineieini was attracted to
the piece because nt‘ its “eolnbinar
tlolt 01' great tunel'ultless and...the
richness oi the poetry."

Rommereim also found that
“Writterreise” was a good way to re-
turn to singing, after liavtng conceit-
traled on other talents wllile at
Grinnell. He is “using the piece as a
springboard to itnprove [his] owli
pertnrmanee." For example, in
“Winterretse,” Rommereim must
siitg lot almost all hour and ﬁfteen
tninutes straight. He plans to do fur-
ther work on “Winlcrrcise,” and per—
form it in other places

On April 23. Rolnmereiln and
Gaub will perform a selection from
“Winterieise” on WOI, the Ames star
tion of NPR.

Turn on the radio

Part fifteen in an on-going
series of KDIC deejay

interviews.

Multiple Dickie winner Jason Stohler ‘99 is back this
semester with his third morning show, “Music for His-
tory Majors." This time around, the History Major is tea-
turing a unique blend of folk, classic rock and contem-
porary music. What seems to make Stohler's sho
unique is his addition of insightful anecdotes about the
historical perspective of the artists and the environment

that bred the music he plays.

DN: So what does it take to win
three dickies?

JS: Ihave no idea. I really don't.
Idon’l know what I do that is differ
ent from other DJs, I guess I'thust
proficient at playing good music,
giving people want they want to hear
and give them a little bit otthe story

behind-the tnuslc...for instance. the

SovieUAmei'ican Cold War is a huge
theme in ‘We Didn't Start the Fire,’
(Billy Joel) but I think there are only
two or three women discussed in the
entire song. One of them is related
to the Brit- '

a

leaves a lot to be desired, but then it
is a four minute and thirty seven seer
ond song, so what can you do”

DN: Is that kind of background
what you mean by ‘music forhistol'y
majors’?

IS; Yeah. Basically, I decided on
‘Music for History Majors’ because
of the show I had last semestei,
which was called The Roots ofColr
lege Radio] I did history solely in
the music; I'd play Ani DlFranct) or
Tracy Chapman and then I'd play
Joan Baez or Bob Dylan; the precur-
sors and the musical history that led
up to this. Now I’m tryitig to talk
about actual history in the song. Next
week I'm going to talk about Bob
Dylan and how history alld Ilistorir
cal movements influenced his music
and how his music influenced his-
torical events, In two weeks from
now, I'm going to play Joan Baez,
because she's huge. She’s very big
with political movements attd politir

DN: What are people's reaction to
this show?

JS: People call in. Tlley might
call to say ‘good show,’ or “my god,

you just played the Sex Pistols and
Roger Miller in the same set: what
are you thinking?‘ but generally
people seem to like it. I've had a
couple ofcalls asking why the show
is called ‘Music for History Majors‘
and I tell them I realize that people
time into KDIC to listen to the mu-
sic and ttot to hear me babble. Be-
cause ot‘that, l tiy to limit how intieh
I talk about any one thing. For ins
stance, this morning I could have
gone on for the entire show about
themes and people and whatnot in
“ W e

DN: What cante first, the interest
in the music or the interest in the hlS'
tory?

IS: I think the history came first.
I‘m a history major and I've defi-
tittely developed an interest in social
movements and the way people in»
teract and wlty people are inspired
to act, instead of the history or wars
arid the ascendancy of presidents. It
really doesn‘t matter what the ruling
class is dotltg, it’s the common
people and their movements. Music
is common.

DN: Hull. Did you do any radio

Grinnell"

JS Nope.

DN So second semester last year
was your first experience as a DJ,

is: Yup,

DN: Why did you decide to do it?

JS: I wanted to do it. Iwanted to
give it a try, to see what it was like.
A lot of people on my ﬂoor had
shows and Iyust wanted to do it.

DN: wtiy mornings?

15. I’ve only had three hour
shows. I‘ve always have had them.
I'm not a morning person, but I like
being on KDIC for three hours. In

fact, I usually get in at 6:45 and star
the Show before KDIC is legall
broadcasting andthan play unti19:5
when I run off to class,

DN: You’re pretty politically ac
tive. Are you interested in express
trig certian views or educating or in
forming your listeners about certiar
perspectives on the show?

JS: Yeah. March is Women’s His
tory month. On the lastshow befor
break, every artist I played was fe
male. There were a few songs the
just had a female vocalist - there
aren’t that many all—female bands on
there unfortunately, but I talked a lo
about Women‘s history from 1776

Scarlet ist Black . Friday, Aprils

.“Hallelujah” for “Luia”

Female duo prepare to release
new rock-pop-folk CD.

BY ANNIKA ENGINEER
Staff Writer

In the fall of '96, the musical
group “Lula" was born. “Luia"comr
prises the musical talents of Erin
Sugrue '93 and Abigail Tapia '98 and
their sound is an interesting mixture
of rock, pop and folk, The name or
tltis group is a derivative otthe wot-d
“hallelujah.” Tapia claims that she
y“kind of liked the way ‘Luia'
sounded," and as the duo was have
ing trouble thinking tip a name for
their band, “Lula" stuck. These two
women create their own lyrics and
harmonies and can often be heard
playing their guitars at Bob’s,

However, Bob’s is not the only
place that one can hear the magical
sounds of “Luia.” Tapia and Sugrue
have also been on two off-campus
tours this school year, During fall
break, the duo made their way to
Kenyon College in Ohio, Wellesley
University in Massachusetts, and
Wesleyan college in Connecticut
Over spring break, they managed to
get hired by the Great Midwestern
ice-cream company in Iowa City all
ter sending them a demo tape, and
carried on from there to the Blue-
berry eafe in Nashville, TN , the Jew-
ish Mother Restaurant in
Charlottesvtlle, VA where they
opened fora couple ofbancls, and fi
natty, on the last leg of their tour, they
returned to Kenyon and Wesleyan.
This Friday the band will be playing
at Java Joe's in Des Moines. This is
already quite an impressive list ofaer
complishments for a band only two
years old.

What is even more impressive.
however, is the fact that these two
women have come out with their
own CD.‘ Though its ofﬁcial release
date is April 1 l, the CD is available
now through Tapia or Sugrue. Tapia's
parents gave her studio ttlne for her
something

DN: Someone'h listening; you're
winning Dickies,

18: (small grin) Yeah. And if
they’re just listening for the music,
that’s OK too.

birthday and so the two recorded
their album and then found a loca-
tion over the Internet where they
could replicate the CD and add art
work. Tapia and Sugrue made 500
copies oftheir CD, which gives the
band something physical to show the
err—campus world.

Tapia and Sugrue are also proud
to call themselves feminists and their
band lS one oftwo all-women bands
on campus that they know of, the
other being “The Fates," The duo
clattn that their music contains clear
feminist Sentiments, Tapia states that,
“the fact that we are out there dis-
playing the fact that women have
complex lives and complex emotions
is, in itself, feminist," Sugrue also
says that site is proud to be in an all-
women band. espectally when most
of the bands on campus and their
songs are male-dominated. “Certain
songs are favorites oi other people
and getrequested alot. like ‘kiss me,’
and we tend to play a song called
“The Crush‘ a lot too," says Sugrue.
“A song called, ‘ForAlanis‘ is really
fun to play," says Tapia. “It’s kind of
funny and very tongue in cheek — in
fact, the ﬁrst two lines of the song
are, ‘I wantyou to knowl'm a singer
/songwriter and ifyou f‘*k with me.
the whole world will know’."

In one sentence, this dynamic
musical duo describes their sound as
“lyrically-driven folk music which
reﬂects our experiences as women."
