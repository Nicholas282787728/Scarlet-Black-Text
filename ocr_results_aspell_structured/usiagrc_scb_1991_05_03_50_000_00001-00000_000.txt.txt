Trustees return for spring meeting

By Kim Eckart

The trustees will return to carn-
pus next Thursday for the annual
spring meeting. The new dorm pro-
posal will be the primary issue on
the agenda, and the Board will
evaluate two designs and the fea-
sible financing methods.

According to President George
Drake, the college wants to avoid
ﬁnancing the new dorm by raising
money from outside sources, “The
issue of the new dortn rests on fundr
ing justas much as design,“ he said.
Drake also saidthallhe Board hopes
to set up a tentative time table for
construction if the plans are ap
proved.
