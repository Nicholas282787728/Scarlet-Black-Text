ON SATURDAY evening the
Chrestomathian society holds a
joint debate with the Philomathinn
society of S. U. L This debate
marks a new departure for any of
our societies, being the ﬁrst inter-
society debate that any of them
have had. While there may be
some objection to holding an in-
terrsociety debate, there’is equal-
ly as much, if not more,to be said
in favor of it. If the debate will
but stir up a little debating en-
thusiasm, it needs no other rec-
ommendation for us. Although
not an intercollegiate debate, it
promises to be a very interesting
one, as both societies are working
hard to win and a good ﬁght is
certain. The debate is worthy of
the generous support of the stu-
dents and we hope that it will be
accorded.

AFTER SOME delay, the question
relative to the captaincy or the
baseball team has been settled by
the election of Mr. W. J. Lindsay,
’00, to ﬁll that ofﬁce. We feel
conﬁdent that no better choice
than Mr. Lindsay could have been
made. Throughout his college
course he has been prominent in
athletics, having tor four years
been a member of both the foot~
ball and baseball teams, and his
long experience in athletics emir
nently ﬁts him to perlorni the due
ties of a captain, As a baseball
player he has made an enviable
record as a sure ﬁeldet and a hard
and opportune hitter. He enjoys
the full conﬁdence of both players
and students, and we have no hesr

itancy in saying that Griiinell's
baseball interests could not be in
better hands.

Gymnasium Exhibitlon.

Next Friday evening will be
the ﬁrst opportunity Grinnell has
had tor several yeai-sor witness-
It
will be given at the mens gymna-
sium, under the direction of Wal-
ter W. Davis, who has so ably
handled the men through the past
months. The exhibition will be
the culmination of his work, shows
ing picked men in theirbest form.
The lovers of the old one ring cir-
cus will be delighted as Prof.
Davis promises to have only one
attraction on the ﬂoor at a time.

’A novel Indian club race, in
\vhlch every class from Senior
college to ﬁrst year academy will

be represented, will open the pro
gram. The vaults, ieiuts, cut-offs
and other movements on the
horse by Parks, Chase, Williams
and Snider will be the same as
those usedin the Yale gymnasium
contests lastyear. The same men
will do a few tricks on the palalr
lel bars, The giant swing and ﬂy-
away will be among the teats per-
tormed on the horizontal bar by
Engelke, Thompson, Clark and
Walleser, These men have been
carefully trained and will do some
very pretty and difﬁcult work.

The most interesting work of
the evening will be the tumbling
by Ross, Walleser. McCord. Mer~
edith and Fiske. Air \vhlrls, front
and back, ﬂoprups and contortionr
ist work will furnish amusement
for the visitors. All the performs
ers will unite in building pyramids
and a tug of war.

Mitchell, '03, will give an exhir
bition club swing with burning
torches.

Another feature of the program
will be the ﬁnal game of the series
of basket ball games that have
been held during the past month,
which will decide the champions
ship of the college. Great inter
est is manifest in this game and it
is expected by all to be very close.
The school is divided in the sup
port of the two teams, and be-
sides, both will have the hearty
:md lusty support of their class,
The line-up will be as follows:
