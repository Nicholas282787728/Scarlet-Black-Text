Films show critic the world

john Ricllards's name has appeared in rhe
388 in the pastiln hyllnes for movie reviews
that he has written. The senior English mn-
jot from Newburyptlr
rr, Massaehusetrs has
spent much ofhis time
at Grinnell studying
film in and out of elass
and counting toward
the estimated 1000 movies he has seen.

The movie reviews he wrote presented a
unique and weleoine challcngc for a person
who believes eaeh movie has so mud. to say.

“There is so mueh you ean say about any
given film unless ir is completely vapid,” he
said. “To he able to address things in an eeo—
nomieal and eolierenr manner is important
and mkcs a pretty good amount oftllought."

Riehards learned mueh ofwhat he knows
about ﬁlm from eourses he took at Grinncll
under many different departments, as there is
no ﬁlm department. For example, he took a
course on Russian ﬁlm history from the Rus-
sian department and one on eririeisin and
eulrure {tom the Art department.

Richards describes this structure as noes
essary heeause Grinnell College is “probably
too small to have a [ﬁlm] department," and
acknowledges that raising rilm eonrses in dire

fcrcnt departments has its pros and eons.

“It is good in a way, because you are able

to get these dirrerenr Viewpoints and dieters

eat ways to tcach,"hc
said, citing how some
courses were more
ahsrraer and theoretie
eal and others were
more teehnieal and
praerieal,

But he fczlrs the lack eta department risks
placing tilm study on the outside ofacademlc
legitimacy and prior
ity.

ln addition ro
learning about movies
in the student role, he
has taught an ExCo
eourse on ﬁlm history.
He desenhed the cxr
peneiiee as “enrich-
ing" and said thar he
learned a ler by having
to reaeli the material.

Whereas some aeadeinies who study ﬁlm

plenty of merit to he found among current
lilms,

He cites Etlrlml Surly/zine afz/M Spot/ts:
Mind as an example. “In almost any type of
cln:ma. there are both good and bad movies,”
he said. “Tllcle ME llorrlblc silent ﬁlms and
than: are horrible musicals."

Part ofRicllnrds'lntcrcst in movies lies in
how relevant he sees the art ofﬁlm as being
to our lives.

“How we view rhe world is l-llgllly deter-
mined by which mowcs we watch," he sald.
“It is a very important ﬁeld to study."

After graduarion, Richards plans to move
back home to New
England and ultimately
would like to make a
carccl out of creative
\Vl’lllng,wllctllcl rharhe
through short stories,
poems oi movie scripts,

Richards reflects on
Grinnell College as a
place rhar was aeadeini»
eally protluetive and
unique.

“I am going to miss the ‘Gitnisell bubble.‘
Thu: are times when I'd go months without
seeing ears, then I'd go downtown, and I'd re-
mcmbcr llml there were cars in the world,”
he said
