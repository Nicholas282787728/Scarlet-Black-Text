Busebnllers Pinned By Penn

by Marty lker

Grinnell's young Pioneers took off
ior Dskaloosa Wednesday in hopes
oi bringing down an undeleated Penn
team but were met iinhospitably and
returned home on the snort end
of a 5-1 stick. .
Things went well for the Pioneers
and Starting pitcher Jim Fallace
throughout the first ihree-and-a-
halt innings, however, and it was
not until the Penn half of the fourth
inning that the solid game began to
crumble Penn scored first onasolo
homer in the first, but Gl‘innell tied
the game 1-1 in the top oi the third
when Fallace walked to lead off
the frame and Craig Zippe follows
ed with a single. Then, aiter a stre
ikeout, Brian Cook singled, scoring
Fallace, and the Pioneers appeared
to be in good position to pile up
a lead, with the heart of the lineup
due up at the plate, but Zippe
was caught in a rundown between
third and home when a wild pitch
bounced back off the screen and
right over to'the catcher, who pre
vented him from scoring. The next
man made out, ending threat.

AS in previous several
years, we are again
storing portable and
standard typewriters
for the summer at no
charge to you.

However, we do sug-
gest this as an excellent
time to have your type
writer checked over to
be all ready for another
full year’s work come

fall.

bled in the first and Mike Levy and
Jeff Dick singled in the latter inn-
ings oi the game.

in a junior-varsity contest precede
ing the main event, Grinnell was
clobbered 17-0, due exclusively to
horrendous fielding on the part ofthe
infield and primarily the third base
man. Only one of the 17 runs was
charged to pitcher Jeff Dick. who
was forced to pitch much more
than should have been necessary
to get the side out in the third
inning, when Penn scored 14 runs.
Grinnell’s three hits in the game
went to Tom Goetz, Rich Arnold
and Jeff Dick.

Golfers Fare Well On Road

by Arturo Tapia Jr.

Last weekend the Gl'innell sand-
baggers went on a gcli tour which
took them to Waterloo, Rochester,
and Norlhiield, The trip proved to
be quite disappointing in the early
stages as high winds and rainy weae
thei' frustrated the Pioneers Howe
ever, the sandbaggers were able to
pull themselves together in the final
phases oi the trip

The first stop of lhe tour was in
Waterloo where the Pioneers played
the UNIrWai'tburg Invitational under
strong winds and muddy iields. 0n
the first day, the Pioneers» did
hurrendously.

The low score for the team was
provided by Deadly Touch Ellenson
who shot an 81. Classic Push Tnpia
and Controlled Hook Friend came in
at 82 While it frustrated long Hitter
Tredway struggled in at 83

The second day oi the tournament
also proved to be a puddle of tears
as the sandbaggers were again ste
ruck by the Weather Mani Long Hits
tei‘ was the low scorer for the Ploy
eers with an 80 While Controlled
Hook came in again at 82. Classic

Push and Deadly Touch also had
their ups and downs and struggled
in with Similar 845 One Putt Sch-
oene also never got started on the
right track.

Thus, to make a long story short,
the Pioneers Shot a combined score
of 558 for the two days and finished
well back in the field 0i nineteen
colleges which participated

On Sunday the Pioneers travelled
to Rochester and played a practice
round on the Conierence course,

The last stop of the tour was Nor-
thiield where the Pioneers played
matches against Carleton, Cornell,
and St. Dlai. On a beautiiul day,
the sandbaggers played some excel»
lent golf. Long Hitler came in'wilh
a mogn' 'cent 71 while Controlled
Hook also‘ played well and finished
with a 76,

Deadly Touch had a 78 and a frus-
trated Classic Push had an 80, One
Putt had a bad day and came in
with a high eighty. The Pioneers
shot a combined score of 305 which
was good enough to beat Carleton
and Cornell, but not quite enough
against St. Olaf's 298

Tennis Squad Fails 6-3

by Andy Bloom

Grinnell’s tennis team again sui-
feted a heartbreaking defeat, this
week to Knox College, at Gales-
burg, III. For the second straight
week, the pioneers were beaten
6-3, again due to the inefficiency
of the doubles teams.

The top three singles matches
were won by Grinnell players, but
irom this point on, the team iell
apart, The scores of these three
matches were Brad VazalaSr’IrS,
677, 6—1, Dave Beeman-TG, 674,
ior his second straight win, andNeil
’I‘rabich—S-G, 6-2, 6-0, Their Vic»
turles however, were offset by 105-
ses in the following three singles
matches: Andy Bloom-O-G, 1-6,
Peter Doeringezes, 0-6, and Ricky
Kellar»6-4, 3-6, 175.

In the double matches, with the
score tied 3-3, the Pioneers could
salvage no victories. in close mate
ches, Vazalas and Trabich were bea-

ten 64}, 278, 5'7, with Beeman and
Bloom lollowing in their iootsteps,
losing 5)], 677. Peter Doering and
Lee Lasky could not repeat last
week's victory, losing 076, 276,
With two matches coming up Sate
urday, against Coc and Cornell at
their respective schools, and lowa
State at 2:30 P.M. on Grinnell’s
tennis courts Tuesday, the netmen
must rise irom theirgluteus maximi
and begin to play tough tennis. The
main problem, according to Couch
John Pfilsch, has been psychologi-
cal, with the team appearing to suf-
ier a letdown come playing time,
The result of this loss is :i 072
team record in lhe Midwest Confer—
ence, which could easily have been
the reverse, had the Gi'innellplayers
performed according to theli‘ ablle
ities. Let’s hope in our next match
the Pioneers taste lhe lhi‘ill oi Vics
tory, instead of the agony of defeat.
