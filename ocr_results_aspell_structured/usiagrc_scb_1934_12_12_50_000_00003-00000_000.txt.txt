THE FOUNDRY, by Albert Helper——

Albert Halper is a sort of Sinclair
Lewis of the big city. He writes of
people he knows, and when he leaves
them they are etched, as intimate
friends, in the reader’s memory. This
novel consise of a series oi incidents
in the lives of men in a Chicago
electrotype foundry during the 12
months that culminated in the stock.
market crash of 1929.

It is a rowdy ‘story, but there is a
fine sympathy in it lor all the char—
acters. bosses as much as those boss-
ed, who are caught in the same in.
scrutable wcb, Only occasionally does
the author lapse into preaching and
then his solutions seem somewhat ar.
chaic. He is at his best when dealing
with machines. He gives you their
sights, sounds and smells in descrip-
tive terms at once a blend of the me-
chanical and the humanistic. By the
time the book is ended you know
those machines and would recognize
their sounds heard from the windows
of a strange building on an unfamiliar
street.

The philosophy the author unfolds is
hard realism or better, perhaps, Cyni—
cism. It succeeds in making the book
the sort or thing you cannot easily
digest without doing a certain amount
of thinking on the whole situation it
presents.

Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Matousek and
son, Otto Matousek, and Mr. and Mrs.
Roscoe Bradt of Newton were dinner
guess oi Laura and Emalee Matousek,
'35, last Sunday.

Jane Timby, ’38, entertained Betty
Laird of Boone last weekend.
