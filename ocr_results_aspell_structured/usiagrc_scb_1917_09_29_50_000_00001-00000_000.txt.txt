Early Season Prospects ‘Are Not
Brilliant at End of
First Week

THUUBLE AHISES IN BAGKFIELI]

New Attack Must Be Built—Ends
And Center Are Also
Problems

with the passage of the lirst
week or: practice, Old Man Gloom
makes his appearance as a member-
of the Griunell football squad. As
yet, the old gentleman is not plays
ing a regular positron, but he is
making a strong bid for a varsity
berth, and strenuous efforts will be
necessary to keep him in the back»
ground.

Trouble seems to be arising in at
least three difiercnt places 7 the
back field, the ends, and the center
of the line. With Barrett, Macy
and Schultz, three letter men, gone
irom the told, coach Tollefson faces
the unwelcome task of building a
new attack as far as llall'rbacks‘
are concerned. Day and Grant, wh
_won their letters last year, e
again out for football, and with
Fleck, who was also on the squad
last season, they form the nucleus

,ot the group from which “Coach”
must pick his men.

Fight In Back Field
Gal‘nel', W’asseuaal‘, Turner, Hoyt
' and Ward are making the light for
positions in the back field extreme-
ly warm, but all of them lack ex-
’ ence in college football. Fleck
’ being used all. Tull back.

wlim his sheer] is of much service.-

Buhlmnn’s failure to appear in
unilorm complicates matters on the
wing positions. it is doubtful
whether he can be out at all, for his
work occupies most of his time. Raf-

. tety is the only letter man in
school who has played end, and he
is being worked on the left end of
the line. Gettys, who got into sev»
crsl games last year. is now getting

. out daily. Diinit and Mchlurray
are both making a good showing,
but the latter's eligibility is some-
what in_ question. He is a fast man,
and gets down under forward pass-
es in fine shape.

'i'eteran (bonds and Tackles

The guards and tackle jobs seem
to be well cared for by tbc veterans
Cress l—loyt, smith, wires and Mar-
tin. The other men wl are out
for line positions at “Fill” Ddllhellr
berger, Gass, Hazard and V. Dau-
benberger. ,

saysell is being used as the cen-
ter, since Gingles is unable to come
out for practice. He is full of
scrap, but is hardly heat-y enough to
bear the attack which will come his
way. He has considerable varsity
expo iencc, and seems to be the lags
ical man [or center or those who
have come out so tar.

‘ Scrimmage Begins

‘ ‘Actual scrimmage was begun on
Thursday night, with the varsity
opposing the scrubs, as the fresh-
rnen_ are not yet organized. The
varsity line has been doing great
work, both on oflense and detonse,
but the unsettled condition of the
back field has not been conducive
of the best results possible in the
attack. Simple formations are be—
ing used for the most part, center-

ing largely on line bucks Emil and
runs.

GRINNELL IlﬁES NUT I
BELIEVE IN HELESi

Community Obligation Should‘
Govern Life Here

Main Says I

7 I

 

“The one fundamental rule WllicllI
governs Gl'mnell college life," said
Presidcnt Main in his Friday morneX
ing chapel talk, "is the rule 01‘
community obligation." I

“The greatest mistake which a:
student can make is the [allure of’
becoming a partncr in the lite and
growth of the college." nnd, he=
continued, “the student can pay
the great debt which he owes the
culiege only in one way, that oi
doing work worthy of membership
Lin the community."
nuirt Believe in miles

I T’lesident Main made it clear that
iGl'luuell does not believe in rules
if they are it [used upon the true
dent by superior arthor‘ y. As a
member oi the tollegé community.
the strident must make his own
rules and in making them he must
take into account the interests of
others.

“I understand that the life of tlle‘
ircrhman is not easy." he said. "I
congratulate you. An easy time
docs not get you anywhere, You
are entering upon four priceless
years years which mean a complete
reconstruction or your ideas and anie
bltions.”

- Demands Hurd “'ork

He advised them to demand hard
work rrom their instructors and
system troio themselves. He tinds
the fundamental lack in college life
to be that or discipline and. order
and he believes that one or the Line
pardoneble sins is to be inferior to
what one may be.

His linal advice to the ireshmen
was tlii" “some of you have come
here ith the idea that you are
center ng a favor on the college by-
your presence. if you have that
idea gel. it out or your head."
