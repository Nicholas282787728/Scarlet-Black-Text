Symposium to address pharmacueticals

iii/JEFF RADERSTONG

Think about the last time you took a pill. It probably wasn't
that long ago. But do yoti know where that pill came trout.>
Do you know what it does to your body? Do you know how it
was developed? At next week's symposium, organized by the
Rosenficld Program in Public Affairs, International Relations
and Human Rights, you can and out.

Director ofthe Rosenfreld Program Sarah Purcell '92, His-
tory, said the "Global Pharmaceuticals" symposium will focus
on more than typical domestic issues of drug prices, Purcell
said the symposium would prompt “people to think about the
connections between nations about how the interrelated na-
ture of the world affects something as straight— forward as
drugs.”

To help people make these connec-
tions, the Rosenfield Program will
bring in a wide range of speakers,
touching on subjects from AIDS
medication in Africa to pharmaceuticals’
impact on healthcare in the United States.

Elaine Marzluff, Chemistry,a Rosenfield Commit
tee member, said there are two main issues people mrrst keep
in mind when discrrssrng drugs and their effect on societymthe
science behind them and the policies created around them,

“The science side is ‘How you make the drugs and make
them cost effective?” Marzluffsaid. “But at the same time we
have people working on the much truer policy side which is
‘Alright, how do we make these drugs accessible?”

A panel discussion with community members in the phar-
maceutical industry will attempt to answer these questions on
Wednesday arternoon, moderated by David Rosenbaum '78,
a bio-patent attorney The panel will include Stephen Sieck,

Chemistry, two local pharmacists from Grinnell Regional
Mcdical Center, and Mark Wilcox '09,who intcmcd last sums
mcr at Prizcr, a major pharmaceutical corporation.

Wilcox said he hopes the symposium will help people one
derstaud the work that goes into creating these pills we take
every day. “Few people realize it takes 15 to lo years and bile
lions Ofdollars to make a drug," he said. “But how many pills
have you taken in your life?"

For this symposium, the Roscnﬁcld Program
worked with the Paulconer Gallery to help proe
motc an art exhibit coming next fall, called "Mole
ecules that Matter," which chronicles the ten

most important molecules of the 20th century,

from nylon to Prozac. Ray Giguerc, a chemistry
professor at Skidmorc college who developed
the exhibit, will present Tuesday night on the

four pharmaceuticals included in the exhibit:
The Faulconcr Gallery will also install an
exhibit cspecially designed for the symposiumr
Tilly Woodward, Curator ofAcadcmic and Public
outreach tor the Gallery, will glue “several thou-
sand” pills Of different colors on to the windows of

JRC 101 to provide a better context for the events.

“Hopefully it will allow people to visualize the sheer quart»
tity of pills [we consume],"Woodwird said.

The symposium runs from Feb 3-s,and the scholars con-
vocation on Thursday, “Public Health Controversies and Vac-
cine Safety,” will be given by Kathleen Strarton orthc institute
of Medici ncr

All events are in JRC 101, except a career talk in the Career
Development Office on Thursday afternoon.

 

Budget

dealing with inflation and consmlcﬁon costs," Sorter
from p. 1

said, “And we will corin’nuc with smaller projects like
the Nollen House project and normal ongoing repair
work"

According to SGA Trernurer Emily Wax ‘09, adn‘iiniso‘ators’
smaller budgets will impact funding for things such to mrnspomro‘on
costs for conferences. “Students will need to get more creative when
looking for funding," she said.

Along the lines of the Strategic Plan, three new Expanding
Knowledge Initiative (EKI) professors will be hired in Ladno Studies,
Islamic Studies and Policy Studies respectively, according to Sortor,
Sonor said the College will cry to ﬁll wcancies as they come up. The
College expects to ﬁll ﬁve to seven positions, and the College will work
to “reeengineer” and “consolidate" jobs left opened.

According to Osgood, he is considering the implementation ofa
wage cap on raises above a certain salary line for administrators, faculty,
and staE, though no action has been taken.

Despite reduoed revenues, administrators said that the school’s
admission policy will not change from a needebllnd to a needeaware
policy for domestic stuanB, as peer institutions like Macalester Cole

ing to a needraware policy, he acknowledges normal adjusrmcnts to
parental contribution and expenses will occur, drough are 52,000 loan
cap initiated last year will stay in place.

According to Osgood, the comprehensive cost of enrollment will
increase by 3 percent, the same as last year, though the increase is less
than previous years. Administrators said they will continue to make
sure that die estimated ﬁnancial need for new and cur-rent students
will be met.

Osgood said he isalso concerned with how the economic situation
will affect students’ post-graduation plans. ”I would like to ensure their
success, and continue to support and protect Grinnell Corps, adding
a prison program position, mough an Anatolia, Greece program posiv
lion has been cut for next year," Osgood said.

Osgood said drat in general the priority is to curb airy major im—
pact for student services, both ﬁnancial and academic. “Budges can’t
always go up, and like a raniiiywe otperience ups and downs,”osgood
said, edioing the words orIowa Governor Chet Culver. “Right now,
we are trying to live with a down, and we are ﬁghting not to lose jobs
like are rest oruie country.”
