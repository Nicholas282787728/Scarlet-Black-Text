Spring Drills

(Continucg from page 1)

 

 

High or the vetei ans Lookztbzulgll
is counting on. The coach’s race
lengthened as he discussed the case
of Ralph West, another veteran
guard who has indicated that he
will not return to school next fall.
“I hate to lose Ralph. He was
the best offensive guard 1 had last
fall."

To support the lettermen,
“Loakie” is counting on Bob Fuchs,
a reserve from last fall, and two
preps, Tscliirley and Lamberson.
The possibility that “Buck” Snow
may be moved into the line as a
guard is still strong, Lookahough
said.

Lettermcn nt Tackle

Three more letter-men head the
tackle list. Moore, Wittrock, and
Ed Woodward are rough, tough
customers wearing a monogram.
shepherd, a promising reserve
from two years ago, together with
Jones and Harris, a couple oi will-
ing freshmen, will provide the re
serve strength at the tackles.

A flock of end candidates head—
ed by three more lettermeii seem
to have the flanks well iortified.
Powers, Bollor. and Haywaid are
the veterans. Powers and Hay—
ward have missed the spring drills
because of their track duties,
Baichly, Joe Woodward. and Cross
roan, three highly rated reserves,
will back up the veterans. Blank,
Hultgren, and Berg, likely fresh-
men, are regarded as good pros-
pects by Lookabaugh.

Backs Numerous

The backs are neither as heavy
nor as rugged as the linemen, hut
they are numerous and every one
of them is willing. Capt. Pres EVr
ans, leading tailback candidate,
Snow, Sampson, Schlotterheck,
Homann, and Welton White are
the lettermen among the hacks.
Reserves held over are Wallace,
Robinson, (the man most likely to
call signals next fall), Harry Liv-
ermorc and McFarlin. New men
from the fresh number only four.
Sears, Crabh, Nash, and Weed
may not see much action next
(111, but will be groomed to take
over the following year.

Harry Barker, another veteran
'back, has informed Lookahaugh
that he does not intend to be in
school next fall. This leaves
“Lookie” without the services of
an experienced kicker,

“We may not win a game next
fall," “Laokie” said in closing the
interview. “Injuries, ineligihilities
and all the rest of the tough
things that can happen haven't
