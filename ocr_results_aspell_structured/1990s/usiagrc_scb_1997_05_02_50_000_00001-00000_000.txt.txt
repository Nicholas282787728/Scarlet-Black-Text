Grinnell campus grapples with sexual assault

Incident Wednesday morning draws variety of student reactions

BY JlLL ERICKSON
News Editor

Astudent was raped early Wednesday
morning in her Grinnell College dorm
room. According to logs kept by Facilir
ties Management, residence halls were
locked at the time. The student reportedly
was seen at Grinnell Regional Medical
Center and returned home to her family
late Wednesday. The Grinnell Police De—
partment is investigating.

The incident occurredjust a week fol-
lowing Grinnell College‘s annual Women
Take Back The Night observance, and
also on the ﬁnal day of April, which is
nationally recognized as Sexual Assault
Awareness Month,

Tom Crady, dean of student affairs,
emphasized Thursday that it is not known
whether the assault is related to a number
of rapes committed on rural campuses in
recent months in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois
and Wisconsin. Crady noted that approxi-
mately two months have passed since the
last reported similar assault, and that other
assaults occurred within days of one an
other. Also, other reported attacks ocA
curred in academic buildings rather than
residence halls.

DNA testing and case details have
linked at least two of the assaults in Iowa
and Nebraska, leading federal investiga-
tors to believe that the attacks might have
been committed by a serial rapist. Other

attacks occurred Feb. 6 at Union College
in Lincoln. Neb.; Feb. 9 at Knox College
in Galcsburg, 111.; Feb. 10 at Carthage
College in Kenosha, Wis; and March 5
at the University of Nebraska in Omaha.
Two attempted rapes were reported Feb.
16 at Augustana College in Rock Island,
111,, and just across the Mississippi River
atSt. Ambrose Univer-
sity in Davenport,
Iowa. No additional at-
tacks at Iowa colleges
have been reported.

Residence halls at
Grinnell are operating
on 24nhour lock-up
through the end of the
semester. The college
also will employ Wells
Fargo Security of
North Dakota to help
beef up campus secu»
rity.

“Our goal is to-
make sure we have heightened security
and to provide updates as we receive new
information,” Crady said.

Counselors from the local mental
health center were stationed at the Stone
wall Resource Center Thursday evening
to talk to students. The college’s escort
service has increased the number of as
corts,on call and will operate until 3 ram.
until further notice.

Information sessions were held
Wednesday evening in residence halls to

dents ali opponunlty to air fears and con-
cerns. A candlelight vigil was held Thurs»
day evening in Steiner l-lall; approxi»
matcly 15 people attended. A group of
students also has organized to help relay
information to those living in off-campus
housing who may not immediately re-

mail.

Media personnel
from several Iowa tele»
vision stations and
newspapers visited
Grinnell Thursday afa
ternoon to interview
students and adminisV
trators. Throughout
Wednesday evening
and Thursday, students
expressed anxiety and
general feelings of un—
rest. Several students
said they were strug-
gling for ways to process their feelings
without undermining the experience of the
victim.

“I feel numb," said Camille Johnson
‘98. “This is a time when I do most ofmy
work late at night and there’s no way
there’s no way.“

A senior female noted: ”In the four
years that I’ve been here. I’ve always felt
relatively safe. I don‘t feel that way any
more."

Senior Challenge coming soon
Event will raise money for Grinnell’s annual fund

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

An arm stretches back, winds up,
pitches, and before you know it the crowd
laughs in excitement at a helpless person
lying before their eyes. This may sound like
an error-ﬁlled baseball game, but May 5 at
Grinnell this helpless, drenched person will
simply be another initiate to the dunk tank.

A dunk tank will be part of the annual
Senior Challenge, which is comprised of
events scheduled over the next two weeks.
The tank is sponsored by the Student De-
velopment Committee, and dunkees will
include SGA President Rupin Thakkar,
SGA president-elect Erin Childress, and
many others.

“[The purpose is] to get people's atten
tion,” explained committee member Matt
Peterson ‘97. The dunk rank consijrutesthe
primary event in this year’s Senior Chal-
lenge, which will raise money for Grinnell
College. Past money has been used to pur—
chase items such as a new printer for Comr
puter Services, or simply has been donated

to the college’s annual fund in honor of
someone wllom donors have felt deserves
recognition.

The dunk tank has grown more success
fulin the years Sinceitbegan. In 1988,when
the first dunk tank event occurred, slightly
more than half of the senior class partici-
pared. According to Micky Munlcy, direc-
tor of annual giving for the Ofﬁce of De»
velopment and Alumni Relations, partici-
pation has increased significantly since
then. Last year, nearly nine out of ten of
graduating seniors took part in the Senior
Challenge. According to Munley and
Peterson, the main focus of this event is
not money but rather the idea of seniors
coming together to show their support for
Gnnnell College.

The Senior Challenge began nine years
ago and Was initiated by Steve Kent ‘67.
Kent wanted to “create an opponunity and
ahabit about giving to the college," Munley
said. Kent felt the development of consis-
tent alumni support was critical to the well
being ofthe annual fund, which is now well
over $2 million dollars, Munley said. As

part of the incentive each year for seniors
to donate, the alumni board promises to
contribute an additional $5 per donor if at
least half of the class participated. If par-
ticipation falls between 50 and 75 percent,
the board Will contribute $10 per donor. And
should more than 75 percent of the senior
class participate, the alumni board will
pledge an additional $750. In light ofa 75
percent or greater participation rate, the
Student Development Committee also is
permitted to chlgnaie how the money will
be used. This year, seniors hope to reach a
100 percent participation rate, Peterson
said, Dave McConnell. director of Dining
Schlces, has offered all seniors a free ba-
gel and coffee at the Fomm Grill should
they achieve this goal.

Some seniors express reservations about
contributing additional money to the colr
legc after having shelled out more than
$80,000 in four years for tuition. Still, the
Senior Challenge is not intended as a
“money grabber," Munley said, but instead
as a “symbol of thank you" to the college
and particularly to the students.

about reactions to temporary added se-
curity measures,

“Some people have been saying that
they‘re annoyed about being reminded
of the assault every time they have to use
their keys to get into the dorms," said
Maggie Taylor ‘99. “Maybe we should
be reminded. This is not just a detached
issue, it‘s somebody‘s life."

“I don't think we’re any safer or less
safe today than we were a week ago,"
one femalejunior said. “It’s not that I‘m
any more afraid of something happen-
ing to me. But from a psychological
standpoint, it feels necessary right now
to have the doors and windows locked
and to feel safe.”

Several men on campus voiced feel-
ings of frustration, anger and helpless-
ness,

“I feel that I can’t do anything ex-
actly," said Matt Sirolly ‘98. “I think that
I can’t really understand the fear but at
the same time I have the anger. My
one practical thought is that cenainly se-
curity has been pretty lax around here,
and things like having the doors locked
now don’t seem like an incredible impo-
sition to me. A lot or people are com»
plaining about it. I think that’s kind of
unrealistic."

Men and women said they found itdif-
ﬁcult to concentrate on academics after
hearing about the assault, Some women

Conference
to become
annual

» - - BYvPHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

The ﬁrst inter—disciplinary conference
on African American studies was held
Wednesday, April 23, in North and South
lounges. Students and professors presented
their research and experience on a variety
of topics falling under the umbrellas of
health, literature. cinema and IGCX. The
conference was sponsored by Grinnell
College‘s African American studies con-
centration in collabolation with the Ofﬁce
of Multicultural Affairs. It was entitled
“Citing, Sighting and Disciplining ‘Race’
in the Academy: The Humanities, the So-
cial Sciences and the Sciences."

Prof. Katya Gibel Azoulay, chair of the
African American studies concentraion at
Grinnell, said she felt the conference was
successful. ’

“We're very pleased that it succeeded
because we’ve had a very large turnout,
both from the campus and the town of
Grinnell," Gibel Amulay said.

The purpose of the conference was to
make “the intellectual climate an integral
part of extracun'icular activities, as well
as to bring students, faculty, and staff into
a shared public arena," she said.

“The other objective of the
concentrations current efforts is in empha-
sizing an inter-disciplinary approach and
showing the ways knowledge is linked
across ﬁelds of study," she continued. “The
third goal was to have anexchange of ideas
so that independent students’ and profes—
sors' works could be shat ."

The conference will become an annual
event, with the second scheduled forApril
15, 1998.

“If you want to make an idea happen,
you just have to carry it out as if it were
going to be asuccess,” GibelAzoulay said.
“In that context, we explicitly and speciﬁ-
cally called this year’s conference the ﬁrst
annual conference."

Next year's conference will be held in
the science building, and it will focus on
music, the arts. and science, but will en<
compass other ﬁelds of study as well.

“We are hoping that an even larger num-
ber of students will participate," Gibel
Azoulay noted. “We are hoping that more
faculty will support the concentration by
encouraging their students to present pa-
pers. The effort to hold a conference is in-
tended to be a community project."

T—shirts from the conference are avail»
able in the college bookstore.
