Ifyou’tc on the run and miss a meal or you
“crave the wave" and have vegan tendencies,
Dining Services has introduced changes ro ca-
rer to your needs.

Dining scrvices has opened the southern
Express in Main to complement Northern
Express, its norrh campus counterpart ar
Cowlcs, Dave McConnell, Director of Din-

T ing services said, “Last April we pioneered the
Northern Express as a grab and go’,concept
for board srudents, and witnessed its great suc-
cess. This summer we cleared a storage area
near Quad so rhat students living in scurh
campus could have access to the Express as
well."

Even so, not all students feel favorably
about the express centers. “Northern and
Southern Express suck,” said John Petite ’01.
“[They’rc] really not cost effective; coke costs
more than a dollar Some students feel there
should be they should be able to make up for
more than one missed meal.

“I think it’s a good idea, but ifvou miss

more than on meal, you should be able to get

more than 17 points.” yannessa Taylor '01
“we need more misty,” said Katherin Wolf
’01.
crinnellians on a board plancan utilize
the Express as a substitute for one meal daily.

“Srudentscan pick up avariety ofitems to pres
pate themselves," said McConnell. “Microwave
piaaa, macaroni and cheese, popcorn, bagels,
pop, cereal, milk and iuiceare just a few ofthe
things available at the Express." McConnell

also said that about 320 students are using the
Express a day.

in addition to the Express areas on North
and south Carrrpus, Dining services also or.

Iowa Ci’ry shu’r’rles established

New prgroam focuses on more accessible

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Arts Editor

shuttle service to Iowa City promises to
be more accessible than it has been in the past,
thanks to the efforts ofa Grinnell alum. After
graduating last spring with a degree in English
arid Gender Studies, Vy Batkauskas, ’98, ar-
ranged to spend a year in Grinnell writing a
novel. Because her writing schedule is flex.
ible, Batkauskas decided to allocatc her week»
ends to the shuttle service. “I’m extremely
busy, but I’m somewhat ﬂ:xible...[and] I like
introducing people to the bustling urban ar-
eas of Iowa," explained Barkauskas.

To Jenn Latimct, 9’9 SGA Studcnt Scr»
viccs Coordinator, this was a fortunate dccie
sion. ,“i’m pretty excited shc’s here for theycar
and willing to drive,” said Larimer, who coor-
dinates the service.

After all, qualiﬁed drivers with ﬂexible
schedules are rate. To be a shuttle drivcr, one
must pass an exam to obtain stat: certiﬁca-
tion as a chauffeur. The exam, also adminis-
[cred to potential truck dtivcts, thucsts in-
formation beyond [hﬂtvl’equcsted on a stan-

dard driving test. Describing one question that
asked the allowable widrh for a semi,
Barkauskas recalled, "it was runny because i
was drinking, this doesn’t relate to anything I’m
doing."

Another qualification rot driving the Iowa
Ciryshurrle is rhardrivcrs must be 21 or older.
Einding adults in crinnell who had taken the
exam and wished to drive was difficult, so sCA
managed to coordinate only a handful oftrips
to lowa City last year.

Now, with Barkauskas as the driver, the only
limits to shuttle accessibility are student intcrr
est and van availability.

Larimer believes incentives for student in»
teresr center around the additional opportunia
ties ofrered in lowa City, Also, for students
without cars, theshuttle isofren thconly means
ofrranspottation, especiallyforfirst years, she
said.

Even with these incentives, Larimcr ac-
knowledges the need to spread awareness ofrhc
service to generate inrercsr. For the semester's
first 15epasscngct shurrlc, available slots filled
slowly.

larimer expects more students to sign up

transportation
in the future. “word spreads best through stu-
dents [telling each other], So we’ll see about
that,"

After this initial trip, no more trips are
planned until after Fall Break. “We sat down
with the calendar,” said Larimet, “and we saw
that the only free vans were on Parcnts’ \‘Vcck-
end and [the weekend of Alice]." For both
activities, Larimet decided students would
probably prefer to stay on campus.

After Brcak, Larimer expects the shuttle
service to expand, “vy is very willing to drive;
she's looking for ideas,” said Larilncr. one
possibility Vy proposed is a Des Moines or
lowa City nighr, which would allow students
to experience urban night life, perhaps via din»
ncr or a movie. Traditionally, the shuttle only
drops students oli‘ lor the day, leaving at ll
am and returning at 5:30 PM on Sundays. or
leaving at 10 am and returning at 5:30 PM on
Saturdays. whatever Larimer and Barkauskas
decide, a complctc schedulc for the rest ofthc
semester's shuttle trips will be posted in the
campus memo after fall break.

To use the shuttle, students must sign tip
at the Forum desk. The cosr is $8 per rrip.

Al Penn. Siaie, same-sex pariners

Customer Service inproved as

Resnet reaches

BY DAVID NATHAN

Grinnell Computer Services is introduc.
ing a twofold eftort to enhance technologies
opporrunities on campus. cccs has opened
an experimental after hours help desk and is
resting potential replacements for the current
Dreams email system.

The help desk currently otters support for
crinnell students with connection problems.
A new email client would allow students on
and oftofResner as a more convenienr email
solution.

According to Gtinnell Computer Services
Director Bill Frances, the future ofernail ar
crinneii is wide open.

“We are testing several email clients that
may become an alternative, and then replace»
merit for Dreams," said Erances. ”Among these
are Netscape Mail, Eudora, Microsoft's email
program Outlook Express and a web-based
email service."

Email client versariliry is a big issue when
choosing a new software package.

Computer services has chosen to look at
programs that run on the lnrerner Mail Ac-
cess Protocol, or IMAP, as opposed to die older
email srandard, Post Office Protocol, or 17012

This is because POP operates by down.
loading email from the network into a
computers hard drive, making downloaded
emails nor rcrrrevablc on other computers.

IMAP clicnis keep letters on the network,
allowing users to access them from any con-
necrcd computer.

Weh-bascd email services operate by us-
ing lava scripr to turn web browsers into
graphical email programs, complete with fold.
ers and icons,

Currentlly, Eudora is the favored email
package because of its vast array of features.
unrortiinarcly, Quaicomm, the company that
makes Eudora, has not released a Macintosh
package that runs on IMAP networks.
Netscape Mail and Outlook Express are amilr
able l'or borlr Macintosh and PC, and IMAP
nr POP compatible

an. iltunun has said they will be releasing
a M icinrosh version oiEudora that works wirh
IMAP networks “soon".

Ar the earlicsr, Frances expects that some
siutlenrs could switch over to the new email
sysrtm, which would be available in every lab,
nostscmesttr. By next fall, heexpecrs Grinncll
will have replaced Drcanis,

siutlenrs who have problems with their
email connection next year will probably be
able to call rbe Rcsllct Help Desk, started this
year by Grinnell Rcsncr specialist Mike Pifct,

Din-

this will cut down
on “produce their"

which we have utilizcd for this year," said
McConnell. still, some students have cravats,

‘If you eat ass food, you can’t study well
and you can’t sleep well, and its because ofdine
ing services,” said Nicholas Rains '00.

New personnel have also been hired. Lyle
Baumun and Johnny Eraffotd were hired as
student supervisors. Happy Miller and Karen
Sleeuwenhoek are service personnel.

McConnell said that srudenr employees are
desperately needed. ‘

“The year has been hectic so tar because
we haven’t had the student help we've needed.
students start at $5.50 and are being hired on
the spot," said McConnell.

students appear to like the changes they’ve
seen at Dining services this year. McConnell
said, “I’v: heard a lot or positive comments
from the students about the Northern and
Southern Express. We are constantly looking
at our program and are trying to improve it. I
believe that the addition of Express and the
rcstofrhe changes for this yearwill be appreci-
ated by the students."

Apparently, the prevailing philosophy orthe
Dining services program is that college food is
a necessity oilife, bur it doesn't have to be pain—
ful.

Even if some students disagree widi the
means, this years dining services staffare tak-
ing srcps to make those ends a reality.

troubleshoot connection problems, gamer er-
ror information and help him correct problems
quickly.

“[T]he number of phone calls I would get
after hours, say from berween 7:00 to 10:00,
that could be answered by someone with some
knowledge of resent in general was
substantial. . .what the hclp desk staffcan do is
take [the callers] though a general walk though,
eliminating orher possibilities so that when I
come in the morning, lnstcad ofhaving to run
the same trouble shooting procedures, I can
get to the problem and reconnect the student
to the network much fastcr.. before that: was
a Rcsnct hcl p dcsk, troubl: Shooting could take
much longer because during the day, because
of their classes, l’d play phone tag with Stu»
dents rot a couple ofdays before I had a chance
to walk them though their problem."

The Resnet help desk staff, which is cur.
rently made up of four students, were chosen
from the Grinncll User Consultant (UC) corps
and from students who had applied to be UCs
with Resnet experience.

so far, the largesr amount ofcalls have come
from students asking for help setting up email
or general connection problems, which can be
causcd by bad Ethernet connections or incore
rcct softwatc conﬁgurations.

Despite some initial problems, Pifer reports
that fewer Rcsnet problems have been reported
than expected this year for the amount of
growth the network wcnt though.

The Rcsnct Specialist attributcs this to a
more cfﬁcicnt server and to a higher levels come
putcrcxpsrtisc in the studentbody. At the same
rime, ifrherc isn’t a need, the help desk may be
dissolved

“Phone calls in general are down this year.
Ifthe numbcr ofpcoplc we help a night makes
what we pay the workers, I think its an impor-
tant scrvice. I'd like to so: it continu: becausci
think it’s a good resource for students, but if
its not being used, rhcre isn't much point in
having it.”

Gtinncll has run a largely student-staffed
faciilry/sraffhelp desk for years and opened the
Resnct help desk after Pifct uttcndcd :l Resner
conference this summer. Resircr is expected
continue its growth next year into campus
owned housing.

After that, Rcsnct will expand as the need
arises, should Grinncll hcgin to cxcccd its band
width.

Currently, Grinnell is connected to the
lnrcrner though a Ti line to Amcs, where it
ioins several other Tl lines and enters a ria-
tionnl T3 pipeline. Current user reports show
Qtinnell’s internct commerce is well below ca-

paciry.
