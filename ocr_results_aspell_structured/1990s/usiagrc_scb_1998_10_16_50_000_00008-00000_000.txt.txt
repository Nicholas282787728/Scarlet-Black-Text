In the rh'ree.year period ending
June so, rhis "tolling" average was up
more rhan 10 percent, so the recent
drop will nor be significanr unless rhe

"The endowmenr funds are de
signed for rhe long rerm,” said Warren
Madden, Isus viee presidenr {or busi-
ness and ﬁnance. "We're nor coneerned
abour ir ar rhis poinr in rirne."

The foundarion has earned 22.3
percenr over rhe lasr rwo years and 24
percenr over rhe lasr rhree years, Mad-
den said.

"The earnings from rhe endow.
menr rhar we provide ro rhe universiry

Cotpotarc bonds, international

"No single company makes up a

The losses at ISU-arc similar to
those at other univtrsitics around thc
