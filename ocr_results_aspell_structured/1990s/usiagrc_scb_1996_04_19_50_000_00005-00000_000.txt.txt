Dear Todd,

April breezes blow across the
land, carrying with them the sweet
scent of life—mt least merapliorical.
1y lfone considers that life began
with ooze, that scent may be more
than metaphorically the scent oflife,
but (except to ourstarved nostrils) it
will never be more than metaphori—
cally sweet, No matter, even sneeze
ing my nose off from the quickening
bloom of basetrient mold, I find

All ofa sudden, everything is in
flux. People are looking up from
their tomes, stretching long unused
limbs, peeling off the rep two layers
of bundling and running off to chase
brightly colored disks across what
will someday soon be a lawn. Some
aregoingcvcnrurilit-rchasingbright.

of the film is Kurt Russell, (Backr

in a tuxedo With no field training in
a motley crew ofarmy men, Despite
the eclectic casting, this movre works
really well.

About the rescue ofa hijacked
American plane from an Islamic ter.
rorisrgroup, Executive Decision asks
the viewer to suspend disbeltef to an
unreal extent. There are minor
glitches in the plot, but there's so
much action and suspense that one
doesn’t notice them. The Viewer is
caught in a whirlwind ofexplosions,
gunwounds and the constant threat

recommend this movie. we liked it
