An Open Letter To Mr. Thomas Crady

Dear Mr. Crady,

An important issue needs to be ad-
dressed which should have been
handled months ago. I am writing
now in response to the recent assault
that happened right here on our own
campus. Some feel that this catas-
trophe may have been avoided if the
Student Affairs Office had better in
formed the campus community about
the recent serial rapestho knows.
The point is that the people at Stu;
dent Affairs have proven to be too
nonchalant about some potentially
dangerous situations, as were when
linformed you of the following in-
cident:

Earlier this' semester, 3 friend and l
were kidnapped from the pub by a
man who dmgged us and drove us
six miles out of town, This man, who
must have been in his 30’s or 40‘s,
drove us to the country, refused to
return us to campus, and demanded
that we do what he wanted. Fortu-
nately, my friend and I were able to
escape when he stopped the car on a
remote country road. We were lucky
to be discovered by the police a few
hours later, freezing in the -10 de-
gree weatherr As bizarre and fright-
ening as this may soilnd, it’s true.
Why is it that other Grinnellians
never heard about this incident?
Don‘t they have a right to be in—
formed about the presence of this
dangerous individual lurking in our
community? I sure think that they
do. However, you failed us by not
taking the proper steps to inform us
(despite repeated promises to myself
and my family); therefore, I have

taken it upon myselfto do so.

As youmay imagine, this experir
once was somewhat traumatic to me,
and I feel the need to insure that it
does not happen againrto myself or

least reform some

to anyone else. The people at Stun
dent Affairs were happy to listen to
my story and to take me to the pol
lice station in order to ﬁle an ofﬁcial
report of the incident, However, you
weren't eager to inform the campus
community of the incident. 'Even
after repeated requests by myself. my
friends and my family, Student Af-
fairs failed to send out any kind of a
notice to the campus.

I want to know Why Student Affairs
failed to take this matter seriously. I

want to know why Student Affairs
downplays incidents like this. I
would like to know why StudentAfA
fairs. an office which seems to fosr
ter the idea that Grinnell is a safe
haven with itself as our protector,
would fail to let us know of these
types of occurrences I wonder how
many other occurrences like this
have been hidden from us? If you
and the others at Student Affairs
function by keeping your students in
the dark, how can you be helping us?
Despite the known presence of a se-
rial rapist who has been assaulting
college women in our own state, Stu-
dent Affairs posted only asmall note
in the VAX login to Warn us (this is

Stressed out yet?

scarcely evidence of any genuine .

concem for our safety). Although the
police suspect that it was not the
same rapist, perhaps a heightened
awareness would have prevented the
assault from taking placerthe point
here is that Student Affairs is guilty
of not giving the proper warning to
its students. Not only this, but the
message itself downplayed the dan-
ger by saying that Student Affairs felt
that Grinnellians were not in danger.
Maybe Student Affairs had some in
formation unavailable to everyone
else, but it seems more likely that you
were under-representing a serious
threat in order to avoid campus un~
rest, IWant to know why we a have
a Student Affairs ofﬁce whose pri-
orities seem to lie in doing the maxi-
mum possible to.protect themselves
instead of what is in the interest of
the students.

Isincerely hope that these questions
will be taken seriously, as they
should be. Perhaps it is time to re-
evaluate the role of Student Affairs,
or to at least reform some of your
policies. Grinnell needs 2i Student
Affairs Ofﬁce that actively works to
inform and protect us, not one that
neglects us.

Sincerely,
Neill Dorn

 

Remember the “Three R’s”: REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE

Dear Campus Community:

As a group of students concerned
with environmental issues we have,
in recent years, dedicated our time
to recycling the paper waste of this
community. Although we do feel that
recycling is an important part of the
environmental movement, it is to our
dismay that we have watched paper
waste increase, rather than decrease.
We are writing out of frustration and
strong concern that the “environmen~
tal message" has somehow been esa
chewed or possibly misinterpreted.
Recycling should serve the purpose

' of "Closing the link," however, we
have found that this is not always the
case at Grinnell College.

An idea that sprouted not so many
years ago was that of: REDUCE—
REUSFrRECYCLE. As a direct re,
sult of society’s perceived need for
timber based toilet paper. dining hall
napkins and massive amounts of in-
credibly redundant printed material,
depletion of the world's resources is
often environmentalists greatest con—
cern, 'In an effort to minimize this
destruction, the environmental
movement spawned the “3 R's." All
too often, however, counterculture
movements and ideas must become
mainstream in order to survive, and
in our consumer economy, where
everything is acommodity ranked by
its dollar value, the mere idea of re»
duclng and reusing doesn’t integrate
well. For example, big business
would prefer that you buy their prod-
ucts continually as opposed to buy-
ing the products once and reusing
them. In fact, they would prefer that
you recycle a product (but continue
to buy more of it) as opposed to re-
ducing the consumption thereof. For
the most part, big business does not
care-about you as anything other than
a possible or likely consumer.

As an academic community suppos-
edly dedicated to social justice
through the research and communi-
cation of ideas and concepts that can
change the way we live, it is ironic
that we should be so oblivious to our
role of power and privilege (over the
environment and the world) within
the consumer economy. We have,
ﬁrst of all, the privilege to read and
write, two activities that put us in a
bracket of consumption unattainable
by the illiterate. Furthermore, we are
either employed by or attend a Very
expensive institution where we emu-
late an extremely high standard of

living. This measure of power and
privilege in our capitalist. consumer:

tonnattonalnalnphle'sand the, like

based worldsiirecllxrsﬂws ouracmcteseqliimwwemam riwewbygbe,

celerated rates of consumption We
are all guilty of overconsumption.

Thus, it is our power and our privia
lege which allows us to consume as
much as we do. this privilege of con-
sumption must be balanced by an
ultimate individual responsibility, It
is not our intention to suggest that
others should not have these privi-
leges and responsibilities, only that
the overall situation will be better if
a greater effort is made to understand
and disseminate ideas about con
sumption and what it does to people,
places, and things, as well as our so-
ciety, lfit means anything, it means
making a greater effort to avoid use
less waste,

Overprinting is a common problem
we run into in the computer labs.
Instead of using recycling as a way
to reduce environmental destruction
(and save more trees). It has become
an excuse for unregulated waste (it,
use more trees): a crutch for our con—
sumer impulses to print out the pa-
per, and then decide we want a dif»
ferent style or a new sentence, The
computer itself is a great example of
a technology purported to contribute
to paper-saving in general. Although
much information is to be had
through the digital lifeline, many
people eventually print it out, only
to toss it later (hopefully into the re-
cycling bin) when it becomes obso-
lete, In a day and age of previously
unknown rates of growth and trans-
fer. absolutism runs high.

Another example is the dissemina—
tion ofintellectual information. All
to often, a book will be purchased
for a class and cannot be resold the
next year because a new edition has
come out. There is a reason for this.
There is an industry, an industry
oftentimes claiming to be environ-
mentally sound, which supplies that
which we demand. We are the ones
controlling the supply. Therefore,
even when the amount of new infor
mation is next to nil, a new edition
of a text will come out. This con-
sumption is often justified in the
name of intellectual discussion. de-
bate, or even scarier, necessity. We
are not asking for the obliteration of
the written word, intellectualism, or
academia, Simply, we want our com-
munity to recognize its role in the
depletion of the Earth’s resources.

A third example is mass overprint—

hundreds. Undelivered pamphlets
make their way to the bins. as do,
similarly, the delivered pamphlets.
Honestly, out of all the information
sent pertaining to graduation, alumni
relations, and blood donating op-
tions, etc,, how much ofit is not im-
mediately thrown in either the gar-
bage or the recycling bin? Not much.
Furthermore, how necessary are
they? This is not meant to indicate
that mass mailings do not have their
place, only to point out the not~50r
surprising similarity between mm,
pulsory mass mailings andjuvik mail.
The campus memo and the Scarlet
& Black are renowned because of the
weekly overprinting deemed as “necr
essary" to make sure everyone can
take one. We have never witnessed
a shortage of either the campus
memo nor the Scarlet & Black. We
also have never seen their readership
meet their printing quota. This evi-
dence supports the observation that
we consistently overconsume, and
are quite complacent.

The myth of recycling is that con-
sumption can be balanced out as long
as one recycles. This is notlrue, We
Will continue consuming until we
either cannot consume any more or
lose the ability/drive to do so, This
is the symptom of all life forms
Changing that rate of consumption
isjust as important, ifnot more ”TV
portant, than recycling what we con
sume. So, please: observe your own
rate(s) of consumption; make an of
fort to understand the ramifications
that it has, and subsequently, try to
decrease the rare of consumption.

Smock Rebuttal

To the Editor:

In last week's Scarlet and Black, a
letter from Chelsea Smock was pub
lished. In this letter Ms, Smock at-
tacked the math deparmcnt for
choices made with respect to the re
cent hmng. Whether someone‘s genr
der should be considered when hir-
ing or not we leave for others to dis-
pute; however, Ms. Smock‘s use of
recent hirings as evidence of min
sogyny in the math department is
inaccurate (and from some perspec-
tives irresponsible) because she uses
unfair rhetoric and incomplete infor-
mation.

The ﬁrst problem consists of Ms,
Smock‘s spending most of her letter
proclaiming the need for women in
the math department when the rea
son the department did not hire the
woman in question had nothing to do
with her gender. She uses one half
of one paragraph to imply that the
choice not to hire was based on the
candidate’s views, and then she de-
votes the rest of her letter to portray-
ing the math department as irrespon-
sible for not hiring a woman. .

The second, and more direct. prob~
lem‘ii'e's wiih the errors in the letter
itself. It is completely possible that
Ms. Smock chose not to avail her
self of the proper information prior
to writing her letter, so these deviaa
tions from fact, both implied and

expressed, may be completely unina
tentional.

First, Ms. Smock implies that the
math department offered the position
to a white man over the minority
woman. This is false: the math den
partment offered the position to a
different minority woman over the
minority woman, To the dismay of
the department, the woman to whom
the job was offered refused it in fa-
vor of an attractive post-doctoral
opportunity elsewhere.

Secondly, the letter as a whole does
not do justice to the great effort exr
pended by the department to facili-
tate the hiring of a female. of the
department's 4 top choices, 3 were
female. The male was such an ex-
tremely strong applicant that another
school hired him before he ever
came to Grinnell, so only the most
radical feminist should have a prob-
lem with the candidate selection pro-
cess. As mentioned earlier, one of
the three women was offered the po
sition. After more than three hours
of discussion, the department agreed
that neither of the other women were
compatible with the educational
standards and philosophy ofGrinnell
College.

Thirdly, Ms, Smock attacked the
department for hiring someone
whose strength lies in research rather
-than in teaching. The fact of the
matter is that he is also a competent
teacher. His research skill is an as-
set on top ofhis other qualifications,
not a sign that his professional in-

Odd Ball - Mike Carr

can Whit,

terests are misplaced.

In conclusion, those looking for
pro-male hiring practices should cast
their Visage somewhere other than
the Grinnell Mathematics and Com-
puter Science Department. Of the
ﬁve candidates the department even-
tually brought to campus, there were
four women and one man. Of the
four women, two were complete dii
sasters, one was offered the position,
and the fourth was a disorganized
wreck whose Cal Tech education had
left her completely unaware of the
role of a math department in a lib»
eral arts education (though otherwise
m thought she was pretty cool). We
applaud the math department’s deci-
sion to hire the best candidate poSA
sible, even if that candidate happened
to be male.
