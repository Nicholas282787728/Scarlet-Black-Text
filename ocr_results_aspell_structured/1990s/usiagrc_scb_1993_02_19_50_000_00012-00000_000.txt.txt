1TH just two weeks re-
maining in the season,
the Grinnell College

men's basketball team stands ready
toplay its final two MidwestConfer-
ence games. The Pioneers will take
their 9710 overall record and 5-7
league mark on the road to play the
SiwashofKnox and the Blue Boys of
Illinois College Fridayand Saturday.

Knox has already wrapped up a
first-place finish in the south divi-
sion. Coach David Arseneault looks
to the Knox game as a “onergame
playoff." Arscneaultsaid, “Knox has
playedgreatballallyearlong,and for
us to be able to play with them we

have to prepare as if this is our one
playoff game. We have two games to
do some proving, and I hope we can
start it off at Knox."

Illinois College will put a team
on the floor which Arsencault says
“is the beSt I.C. team since I’ve been
at Grinnell.” They will provide the
Pioneers with their final conference
challenge of the season.

LastFr'idaythePionecrsknocked
offa pesky Coe team by a narrow 857
83 margin.“Wedidallthelittiethings,
and it‘s the little things that win ball
games,” said Arseneault. “We did
not have a great shooting night, but
we screened well, we played tough
defense, and we had balance. I only
wish we could replicate that perfor-
mance more often."

“CraigStuder, Chad Folsom,and
Andris Upitis had their bestgames of
the season against Coe," said
Arscneault after the game. Studer
continued his secondrhalf ofthe sea-
son spurt, drilling 7 of l 1 shots from
the field for 20 points. Folsom came
offthe bench to spark the Pioneers in
the second half With 8 points.

Freshman Upitisalso had a strong
night with 9 points and 6 rebounds.
Other top performances were turned
in by Steve Dickmann who put in 16
points and Ed Bands contributing 17.

”Th is was the type of perfor-
mance I envisioned for this team at
the beginning of the season, I just
hope we can build on it and take our
momentum to Knox and Illinois Col—
lege,” said Arseneault.
