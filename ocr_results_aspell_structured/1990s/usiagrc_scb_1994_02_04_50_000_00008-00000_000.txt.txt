winning season at Monmouth

By Todd Young

FTER winning one of two
games in Wisconsin last
weekend, the Grinnell Cole

lege men‘s basketball team (1075, 5,
3) willreturn to Southrdivision action
at Monmouth today. The Pioneers
will be playing for second place in
the division as well as their first win-
ning season in 30 years.

Coach David Arsenauli said,
“We hold the fate of our season in our
own hands. Of our ﬁnal six games.
three are against teams in front of us
in the Midwest Conference playoff
race. Our ﬁrst chance to make up
ground is against Monmouth.”

Monmouth is led bylanceCasLle,
the second-leading scorer in the con-
ference and one of the top rebounders.

Grinnell defeated Carroll last
Saturday, 103-90, with a strong early
showing andasolid second half. After

jumpingoutlo anearly 16-point lead,
the Pioneers faltcred and were ber
hindat the half, 5342; however, over
the final 20 minutes they outscored
Carroll. 61-37.

“We played an excellent second
half. Our traps were much more effec-
tive because the team was moving
together and communicating more. It
was great to see Kevin Rennen step up
andhit two big threes when we needed
them. He has done the little things all
year and it win a thrill for the team to
have him make some big hoops for
us," said Coach Arsenauli.

Steve Diekmann led the charge
offensively with 38 points. He conr
tinues to lead all NCAA divisions in
scoring at 32.1 points per game. Jeff
Boyle added 21. along with four as
sists. Andris Upitis had a big day on
the boards. snatching 11 rebounds.

I Darby Gym in the next week

as the Grinnell College women’s basr

ketball team plays host to three key

league teams. Cornell took the court

Wednesday, Knox an‘ives tomorrow,

and the home stand winds up Tues—
day against Coe.

The first part of the home stand
saw the Pioneers defeat Monmouth,
83-66, but slip up against St. Norbert
and Lawrence, 80-61 and 7263.
Coach Marti Kingsley was very
pleased with the improvement she
saw in thereccnt games. “Peoplecan
see the improvement this team has
made, especiallyagainstMonmouth.
We werepassingand moving the ball
much better than we had in previous
games."

Stephanie Walters tore up the
nets in the Monmouth game with 34
points on 12 of 16 shooting. Her fivc
three-pointers Lied a school record.
Also in double figures were Sara
Schoen and Dacey Waldron, each
with 14,andJodi Van Meter with 12.
Van Meter added 17 rebounds.

Coach Kingsley pointed out that
Monmouth had dominated the Pio—
neers in the past, but their zone dev
fense gave the guards room to oper-

ate, freeing them up for their shots.

Grinnell played St. Norbert well
in thefirsi half, but was unable to step
up in the second half as St. Norbert
shot 75% from the field in the deci-
sivc run. “Playing a solid 40 minutes
has been a problem for us, and we
really showed that against Si.
Norbert," commented Kingsley. “For
us to achieve, we need to oveiachieve.
In that second half we really did not
overachieve."

Walters ledGrinnellscorerswith
20 points and 11 rebounds. while
Schoen and Van Meter each chipped
in 15.

Against Lawrence the Pioneers
came out very sluggishly, but then
turned it on in the second half to make
the game close. Van Meter put in 30
points while grabbing 19 rebounds.
Kingsley directed words of praise to
wardVanMeter and AllisonWickens.
“Allison playcx‘l defensively outof her

mind,” said Kingsley. “She gave us :

some stops we really needed.”

In upcoming games Kingsley
hopes the team can stick with their
opponents for the full 40 minutes.
“We have a young, inexperienced
team and that has showed this year,
butour improvement is obvious. We
have all the pieces and the right atti-
tude. so we’re really looking forward
to these next home games.”

 

behind 63754 at halftime, Grinnell
tied the score at 69 on a three-point
field goal by Todd McGuire. The

Beloit finally gained a 10-point lead
with 1:32 remaining. The Pioneers
fought back, but Jeff Boyle’s final
three rimmed inrand-out.

Grinnell had five players in
double figures. Diekmann scored 32
points while Boyle added 26. Craig

and that is what we strive for
every time we play.”
