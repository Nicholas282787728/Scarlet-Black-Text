From petteet seasons to perfect
gamcs, Grinncll athlctics has been full
orhighlt'ghts this year.

The numbers alone from the
1998—99 sports season are enough to
ﬁll the yearly highlight reel: 20 NCAA
Division III athletic teams, four Mid—
west Conferenec team ehampionships,
several MWC individual champions,
one undefeated team and one perteet
game .

But the numbers tcll only halfthc
story. The test or this year's sporting
tall: lies in each individual athlete who
contributed to thc succcss of all the
Grinncll teal-m.

The team's hard work, undefeated

not enough to earn it a berth in the
NCAA—III playoffs, though.
Dougherty said that the team hopes
to remedy that by repeating the node.

coming the large group or ritst.year
stiirs that joined the team this y
lncn's hasketbail was saying goodbye
to perhaps the best known Gunnell

athlete in recent history: JeriClement
'99.

Clement, a guard who has been fca»
tuted in a variety or national sports
pirblieatiorrs and broadcasts (ineluding
a national threeepoint shootout aired
nationwide this winter), holds the
NCAA ailedivision t<cutd for most
three pointers in one game (19). the
NCAAeIII reeord for most points in
one game (77) and the sehuol teeord
for most eateet points (2229).

Actinnell native, Clement said his
tune as a Fionccr has been one he'll
never rotget

“it's been a long journey, but a lot
orpositiite experiences," he said “l’ve
gutt’ so much out ormy eateer here
at Crinneil, it's been unbelievable "

But clement said it will be his
teammates rather than his career he
will miss most when he graduates on
May 24.

“Everybodys positive, everybody
wants to win," he said or his team.

"They’re also a great bunch otguys to
hang out with,"

clement lead the team to an 11—
li mark for the year,

Perfection

crement was not the only player
to make history this season.

Jake Cltnvcz '01 set a Grinntll
record by becoming the ﬁrst player in
pioneer baselsall history to throw a per.
reet game.

Fittingly, the perfect game came
against longtime rival Coe College.
Chavez had 13 strikeouts in the game.

Tire team has also set a new single.
season sehool win record.

The list of highlights for all of
Grinncll’s 20 sports teams goes on.

And although the level orsueeess
emoyed by each teanr varied this year,
there is one thing all the athletes agreed
upon at scason’s and: next year, the '
Grinnell College highlight reel can
only get longer.
