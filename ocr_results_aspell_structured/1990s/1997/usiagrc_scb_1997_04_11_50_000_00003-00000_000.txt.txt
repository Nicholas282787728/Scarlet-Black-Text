More snow?!? Isn’t it spring yet?!?!

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Last Saturday night I couldn’t help
but think of the words of Richard
Aschcroft, the lead vocalist of the
Verve, as a misty fog lay on my skin.
He sings, “I was thinking maybe we
could go outside, let the night sky
cool your foolish pride, don‘t you
feel alive, these are your times and
our highs". Within minutes of this
meditation, ﬁreworks were scream-
ing across South Campus as drunken
Voices and ﬁre alarms ﬁlled the cha-
otic air. For some reason the air that
night was ﬁlled with great anticipa-
tion, as people were letting out the
months of indoor pent up energy.
Finally people could hear the voice
of spring.

Since March 21st, when spring
bumped the temperature in Des
Moines up to almost 70 degrees, the
season has become anything but
ideal. While for the ﬁrst several days

' after break the temperature was gen-
erally hovering in the 50‘s and 60‘s,
it has made a dramatic shift towards
winter. With highs only in the thira
ties for most of the past week and a
snowstorm which left a fresh snow
pack of six to eight inches on the
ground this past Wednesday, summer
may seem a long way away.

With the advent of spring has come
another phenomenona which has lit
up the pre-dawn and dusk skies, the
Hale-Eopp comet, While many
people have enjoyed its beauty, oth»
ers have made dire predictions in re»
lation to the comet. After studying a

crop formation called the Longwood
Warren Crop circle and its associa-
tion with the comet, David Pinnegar
concluded that, “We have increased
the energy and increased the disor-
der. We have increased the energy of
the disorder. We have increased the
disorder of the energy , . . the strength
with which Zeus
might hit us with
a thunderbolt or
Thor with his
hammer may de-
pend on our love
for , our
neighbour and
the extent to
which we can
a c h i e v e
Roosevelt’s free»
doms for which
the millions of
souls were sacriﬁced in the second
World War.”

Indeed, astronomical phenomenon
seem to be taking the beauty and ex-
citement of spring to new levels.
Next Wednesday a solar ﬂare is ex-
pected to hit Earth’s outer
stmospherc, possibly creating quite
stunning visual effects. The energy
released during a solar ﬂare has been
described as equivalent to millions
of 100 megaton hydrogen bombs,
and is a “sudden, rapid and intense
variation in the bright the surface of
the sun." The flare will hit the earth
quite harmlessly, but there is astrong
possiblity it will hit the visual ﬁeld
of Grinnellians forecefully.
Astronmers predict that it will be
“possible that the Northern Lights
will be visible from Boston to San

decrease.

dents actually at—
tending classes will

Francisco," This spring has already
begun with a number of unusual phe
nomenon, including one night when
a lunar eclipse, Hale—Bopp and Mars
teamed up to create a dazzling sight
in the night sky.

However, regardless of these asqu
nomical effects, spring has both psye
chological and
physical effects
which seem to
span every re—
turn of the sea
son, The 16% of
the population
that is weather
sensitive will
have to watch
their physical
and emotional
health in the
coming weeks
as the extreme shifts in the weather
of a Midwest spring may mean ex»
treme psychological shifts. “Atmo-
spheric inﬂuences play upon people
as the mind plays upon the strings of
an aeolian harp," remarks one intel-
lectual from the early 20th century.

In addition, approximately 20% of
the campus will be seen with runny
noses, red eyes while they are sneez-
ing and wheezing from the effects of
Allergic Rhinitis, an allergy to tree
pollen. Those who suffer from the
“Alice in Wonderland" syndrome,
which is the consistent suffering of
classical migraines, should also be
on alert as spring approaches, Dur-
ing the spring, it seems that the in-
evitable rain and other midwest
spring variables like humidity can be
correlated with an increase in mi-

graine frequency. As a result of these
migraines, economies such as that of
Canada’s can lose over $500,000,000
in lost work days alone. Despite the
number of negative physical, emo
tional and economic effects ofspting,
spring is still the rebirth of outdoor
activites and excitement such as the
annual Grinnell Relays.

According to data, professors can
expect that students will most likely
produce better work, but the likeli»
hood of students actually attending
classes will decrease. As one study
from New York found, in a high
school classroom “the maximum of
attendance is indicated by the groups
20 degrees to 25 degrees." Ultir
mately, combining increased absence
with decreased stress means that the
performance of students is pretty
much the same as during the winter.

On those days that students skip
class and go outdoors to enjoy the
spring weather, the breeze blowing
against their faces, the squirrels look
ing inquisitely at them lying out on
Central Campus, spring and its
beauty have taken full form. People
are thinking ofthe dreamy sounds of
Sesame Street songs. “Sunny day.
sweeping the clouds away, on my
way to where the air is sweet..." Afe
ter all, at this time of year, even as
the snow pack glares at you, the sun
is melting it away. According to the
National Weather Service, by Sun-
day it will be sunny with a high of
45 degrees, which will begin a warm
up that will reach the sixties by Tuesa
day.

EVERYTHING YOU EVER
WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT
BLOOD AND MARROW

Karmi Mattson, SGA Social Coorv
dinator

Okay, so you know all about blood
donation, right? Takes less than an
hour, veriﬁes your healthiness, gives
you free cookies. You‘re all over that.
Some things you may not know: The
drive is April 16 & 17 from 103m-
4pm in North Lounge, and if you
make an appointment in advance,
you won't have to wait as long. To
make an appointment, vax Karmi
[Manson] or the SGA [Social] Com-
mittee and give your preference for
times. Another thing you may not
know: the earrpiercing deferral has
been changed! So if you’ve been
rejected in the past for being newly,
pierced, you are now eligible, so you
can’t get offthat easily.

And you’ve heard about marrow regr
istration, right? The Blood Drive is
being held in conjunction with the
National Marrow Donor Registry
this semester. which gives you the
opportunity to have your blood typed
and placed on the Registry, to deter-
mine whether you could serve as a
life-saving marrow donor for some
one. And you probably THINK you
know all about marrow donation,
right? Like you’re envisioning some-
one chasing after you in North
Lounge with a huge needle that
they ‘re going to stick in your hip and
cause great pain? Well, throw that
one out the window because THAT
IS A MISCONCEPTION. It is erro»

neous, bad, evil, and downright
wrong. In order to be eligible to be-
come a marrow donor, all you need
to do to be placed on the Registry is
donate two tablespoons of blood
from your arm. Marrow is actually
found throughout your body, notjust
in your bones, and that‘s why you can
be typed without anyone going near
your hipbone. It‘s really that simple.

Okay, so registration is easy. Why is
it important? Well, for patients with
life-threatening blood diseases such
as leukemia or aplastic anemia, of-
ten their last hope of survival comes
from a marrow transplant. Because
the components of marrow are ge-
netict the best chance of ﬁnding a
donor whose components match is
to look within the patient's family.
However, if the patient doesn’t have
siblings whose marrow matches, an
unrelated donor must be found, and
this is where the National Marrow
Donor Registry comes in. The sta-
tistical probability of ﬁnding an un-
related donor can be small, but the
chances increase every time another
person volunteers to become part of
the Registry. Right now, the aver-
age patient needing an unrelated do»
nor has about a 50% chance of ﬁnd
ing one through the Registry. You
can help to increase that percentage.
And while chances are great that
you‘ll never get chosen to be a mar
row donor, you can help to better the
odds.

If you’d like more information on
blood donation or marrow registra-
tion, please contact Drive Chairper-
son Katmi [Mattson] ‘97 or recent
marrow donor Joanna [Rau] ‘00.

Hi. How was your break"! Tell me
all about it. Go ahead say it outloud
right now, I‘m listening. Hmm.
thanks for sharing.

I have been asked repeatedly if I
write the questions as well as the
answers included in this column.
Well the answer to that one is: no
way! Are you nuts? Do you thinkl
have the time for that? Because all
of you slacked too much over break
(the truth hurts, doesn’t it?) and failed
to
write me questions I actually, for the
ﬁrst time ever, have no questions to
answer or commentaries to reply to
this week. (Sigh collectively now.)

Because I know you kids are actu-
ally so full of questions that you can’t
decide which one to spew out ﬁrst I
have devised a temporary answering
system. First think of your question
and say it out loud (this is called ”in-
teractive fun“ or “actin‘ goonie"),
Next randomly select an answer from
those listed below. Questions are
answered and problems are solved.
Here are your answer choices:

1. This is a complex and insight-
ful question. Just being able to ask
it shows maturity and critical think-
ing skills. Way to go.

2. What are you, nuts? 72 of
course!

3. No way. That is a bad idea. I
do not recommend it at all. Pure evil.

Smile! The S & B
staﬂc loves you!

in the future be sure to actually send

thing would be ﬁne). Feel free to use

day.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A friendly group of goth picnicers enjoy the kind of weather
most places have in the spring. Due to inclement
conditions, the S & B was unable to procure a similar

Spring memories

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Features Editor

1 will never forgetmy ﬁrst Grinnell
pseudonspring — the freshman fever,
the heartbreak, the evil professor who
preyed on hopeful, hormone-ridden
ﬁrst»years like me.

On the ﬁrst night ofsnow each win-
ter, campus is overrun by giddy
freshpeople from southern Califor-
nia, Texas, and other such paradises
where snow is only a myth. a
storybook setting. Although I had
seen snow before, I was nearly as
excited by the peaceful scene. In
Kansas, we only get 2’or 3 signifi-
cant snows a year, and as a child I
was always lucky if there was snow
fort material around for more than a
couple of days.

After the snow had stuck around for
a month or so, I was a little less en-
chanted. I suppose I had heard sto-
ries about Iowa and its harsh winters,
but Grinnell only being about 3 hours
north of my home near Kansas City,
I didn’t expect too much difference.

I didn’t think of the fact that Iowa
is as'flat as a plate, and thus windier
than Chicago, and thus colder than
shit! '

My ﬁrst Grinnell winter dragged
on. Idreamt nightly ofsun and green
grass and cursed the viewbook that
had vastly underrepresented the re~
ality of these ice and mud-covered
grounds.

March is traditionally the thawing
month. Spring ofﬁcially begins on
March 21. That ﬁrst year, when I dis-
covered that the normal laws of
weather and the seasons and so on
don‘t apply to central Iowa, I was
devastated...a devastation only inten-

siﬁed by the taunting of my vindic-
tive Poetry in English prof, W.
Michael Cavanagh.

Most of you understand what hap-
pens in the so-called spring months
in Grinnell. Sometimes starting as
early as February, there are 2, maybe
3 day bursts of beautiful weather. For
a few glorious, long-awaited days,
you wake up to the sound of birds
chirping, sun glowing through your
window, and excited shouts echoing
all over campus: “It’s spring! Quick,
put on your bathing suit and come
lay out on the loggia!"

The next day, it snows. Every time.

Mr. Cavanagh understood this. and
every day us eager freshmen showed
up to class begging to have class out-
side. he’d reply with an evil snicker,
“You think this is spring?! There'll
be snow on the ground for another
month! HA HA HA HA!"

However, I continued to hold on to
my hope, praying for a true spring.
Mr. Cavanagh’s continuous scofﬁng
didn’t break my spirit...until I real-
ized around the beginning of May,
as I put on my winter coat to go to
class for the zillionth time of the se-
mester, that he was right. '

My suspicions were conﬁrtned by
reports from those poor souls who
stayed on in Iowa for the summer. '
One magical day in June the snow
melts, and temperature gradually
begins to rise...up into the 905, with
75% humidity. Straight from winter
to summer, a geographical, meteo-
rological anomaly...this is Grinnell.

So kids. enjoy those_few days of
sunshine. Spend them outsidenskip
class and blame it on the S & E. I
promise you it will be snowing to-
morrow.
