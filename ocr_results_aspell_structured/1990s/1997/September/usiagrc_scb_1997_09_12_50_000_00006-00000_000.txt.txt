Pomona, weather
Pioneers

too hot for
to handle

BY SETH KLEIMAN
Sports Information

As the temperature and hu-
midity reached grueling heights
here last Saturday, the Grinnell
College football team could not
cool down the sweltering attack
of Pomona which bettered the
Pioneers, 55-20, in their season
opener, This Saturday the
Gridders will play at Principia in
another non»conference game.

The Grinnellians began the
Pomona game’ with a significant
drive from their own 16~yard line
to Pomona’s 36, Two crucial
penalties forced them to punt and
the Sagehens quickly took ad
vantage, scoring touchdowns on

1'

their first six possessions.

“It was definitely disappointr
ing," commented Coach Greg
Wallace. “We had high hopes
going into this game, but we
were also realistic because we
knew that they were an awfully
good squad. Their quarterback
was exceptional and the team
played like a well»0iled ma-
chine."

At the half the Pioneers were
down,‘4177. Troy Dougherty
connected with Wade Krause for
a 41-yard Grinnell touchdown
pass, Nathan Solmose added the
extra point.

“Quite honestly. we could not
run the ball well or stop the run
efficiently. So we were playing

catch-up from very early,” r -
marked Wallace. ,

The Sagehens racked up 353
yards rushing on 63 attempts
while the Pioneers totaled only
6 yards on 21 attempts.

“We will definitely need to
work hard and focus on running
the ball more effectively this
week while practicing our de-
fense against the rush," added
Wallace.

In the second half things
looked somewhat better_for
Grinnell. The Pioneers were able
to rack up 13 points, while hold»
ing Pomona to just 14 second»
half points. Dougherty and Ri»
chard Wcmer led the attack,
Daugherty finding Werner twice
for 12»yard and 6»yard touch»
downs. Daugherty accumulated
some impressive numbers, total-
ing 353 yards passing on 52 at-
tempts with three touchdowns
and two interceptions.

Others who compiled positive

stats for the of-
fense were Krausc,

The Pioneers opened with a 371
victory at William Penn, a team
which downed Grinnell four times in

rial Classic,

By finishing third behind
Wartburg and Loras the Pioneers

level they performed at during the
early 19905, Four Grinnell runners

man, “Gipson and Notheis showed
that they are ready to run well this
yedL”

Iowa Statc meet. We haven't had

.a chance to run on this course. It

was developed strictly for cross
country and has been a site for the
NCAA meet. It also is our first
five»lni1e race this season The re»
sults should tell us a lot about
where we are," said Freeman,

Today the Grinnell College
women's cross country team will
be inAines for Iowa State's Invita»

Pioneers’ first 5K race of the scar

“We will begin running in those
packing orders in today‘s practice.
The Ram Run was a tw07mile
event, while most of the races we
compete in will be 5K races, in
cluding the Midwest Conference
championships," concluded Free»
man.

' Best start in 20 years has first-year coach

have beaten Westminster. After that
loss, though, we responded with
some great play,” said Sonnichsen.

Westminster prevailed, 8-15, 15-
l, 8»lS, 16»l4 and 15-8. The Pio-
neers won in four games against
Rhodes 15»6, 15-7, 7-15 and 16-14.
Then they swept Hendrix and
Webster in three games.

Coach Sonnichsen pointed to set»
ter Amber Donahue as the top per-
former. She set almost every game.
He noted, ”She is really beginning
to understand how to guide the
team."

Veteran captain Courtney Sapp
played well, especially on defense,
Two sophomores, middle hitter
Sacha Steenhoek and defensive spe-
cialist Melissa Kempenaar, were
solid in their positions. “Sacha's
middle hitting will just make our
outside hitting better," explained
Sonnichsen. “Then we can score
from two areas on the court."

At Augustana the spikers are
pooled with Carthage and Eureka.
The tournament has two pools and a
championship round.

“We played well against that level
ofcompetition last week. I think We
are going to get a lot better once we
get time with our system,“ reported
Sonnichsen.
