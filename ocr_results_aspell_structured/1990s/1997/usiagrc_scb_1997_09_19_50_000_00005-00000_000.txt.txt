Last spring there was an *incident',
an alleged assault, the crime for
merty known as rape. There has
been no trial before judge or yury, but
here on campus guilt has been laid.
The accused‘s name appeared in the
S&B last week, providing the news
for those formerly out of the loop.
”I knew that guy was trouble" they
say with the shameless joy scandal
brings, but they knew nothing then
and they know no more now. But
my point has nothing to do with his
guilt or innocence. nor the typically
uninformed assumptions made by
those who put too much trust in the
media and the authorities which feed
them. I will not even mention the
questionable ethics of the paper in
choosing to release the student‘s
name in such a slanted story, nor
their omission ofthe victim's name,
a subject questioned far too infrev
quently by editors. My point is not
there, it is with the administration.
The subject ofthis essay is not crime,
it is fear.

The administration, from the day
after the reporting of the incident,
has incited fear in the student body
Knowing that tension and apprehen-
sion already existed due to the ex-
istence ofa serial rapist striking simie
lar midwestern towns. they reported
the crimeto students without any in

dicatioii that the two were related. It
was not until after iliey had changed
the locks, instituted a twenty four
hour lockup, and brought an outside
security force to campus that they an
nounced iliai it was a Grinnell stu-
dent involved iii the tillcged attack.
And now with the only new devel-
opment being the issuing of an ar-
rcsi wairaiii, the administration has
continued to use this iiicideni as fuel
for their desire to make additional
changes in campus security. None
of the changes implemented last
spring would have prevented the ale
lcged assault, None of the propose
als currently being run through the
iiiipassive. head nodding, cheese fol-
lowing student government would
have prevented it either. These new
measures do nothing but increase an
attitude of fear and distrust on cam-
pus, They isolate students from
Grinnell residents, giving credence
to those who believe that strangers
are to be feared And worst of all
they foster a false sense ofsecurity.
What power can these guards be
given? Will they be allowed to stop
people and ask them their business
on campus? Will students need ID’s
so as not to be detained? Will a
Grinnell resident such as myself be
unwelcome on campus, automati-
cally a threat because I‘m an out-
Sider7

The administration does not care
about you. the student. They are
leaders ofan institution and they are
concerned with image and direction.
They are looking to change both,
They have visions of ivy and corpo-
rate donations. They want alumni
to see their investments locked safe.
as tfin a bank.

Safety and freedom can work to
gether; this is a dream behind
America. But Chains and locks and
an authoritative eye lnnder the cause.

Don’t Ask Me, I’m Just A Girl

BY Lizz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

So I was having problems thinking
of what to write about for this week.
I was going to tell you about me and
Alice, but nothing all that exciting
has happened to me at these func-
tions. Well, kind of. You see I
missed my firstAlice in Wonderland
festival because I was in Madison
visiting my “no really, this relation-
ship will last because we’re in love"
high school boyfriend. We broke up
that day of Alice. I won’t go any
further because anyone who knew
me my ﬁrst year has heard this damn
story over a thousand times. Really,
it‘s true.

Anyway, I thought I’d tell you
about something else happening on
this campus, Something really
frightening and pretty damn sick It
occurred to me as I was leaving
Bob’s on Wednesday night after a
posteTV caffeine drink, I saw these
two people sitting in Cleveland
beach holding hands, talking and
looking into each olliers’ eyes. Orr/i,

they metal some parry, meeting eyes
through ihc smoky haze and room of
stumbling drunks. Maybe they were
the stumbling drunks. Isn’t ll Tweet.
Well. they’re not the only ones All
throughout campus and town I see
all ofthese people looking all happy
because they just got laid. are about
to get laid, thinking about how they
just met this person they will prob-

ably havc sex Willi later in tire week,

They promote fear, raising the spec
ire of danger which cannot be cort~
trolled except by these extraordinary
means. This iowii is not a dangerous
place. This campus IS even less so.
We live in ii world of horrors. but in
coming to Grinnell we have chosen
something different, we have taken
the opportunity to step out of that
other world.

Grinnell is as much a social expcrh
meiit as it is an academic institution.
it is a place for people of all back
grounds and beliefs to come together
and establish a community, removed
from the mainstream OfAmCl ica. In
the past it has been a haven for free
thinkers and alternative lifestyles.
These things do not thrive under lock
and key. niiscoliege'sreccntadmin-
istrations have been more concerned
with the growth of their endowment
than with your growth as an indi-
vidual. In trying to create a Grinnell
more like other colleges, they are suce
ceeding and that is the greatest faile
me of all

<>

This community belongs to the slur
dents-— that is the reality ofself—gov-
ernance. The safety of this commu-
nity is dependent on the people within
it. Structuring life in orbit of fear
guarantees everyone will be afraid.
There will always be something more
terrifying and you will yield yet one
other right to be rid of it. The great-
est safety we can achieve is from
knowmg each other, respecting each
other and talking openly with each
other. The greatest safety is to grow
strong, You are your own great pro-
tector, only you can protect yourself
from pain.

Arrogance

BY TEQUIA BURT
Opinion Editor

Has anyone on this campus ever
been afraid to talk? Lately. I have
been finding myselfiii this position,
When words like black. white. Afri-
can American, woman and feminism
come up I find myself stuttering
wishing the floor would swallow me
tip. This is not to say that I don‘t talk
about the history and oppression of
black women frequently. Anyone
who knows me, knows I do. But of
ten I find inyselfbein g self~conscious
when I do tilts because I feel I talk so
much, people don't want to listen to
me. Ialso find people want to tune
me out because they are ignorantand
don’t want to have to contemplate
how their own lives function in the
oppression of people ofcolor. Anye
onc whose parents' income ranges
from wealthy to comfortably middle
class and who live in a big house in
the suburbs has an active role in the
oppression of others, Sadly, they
commonly don’t realize this so think
I'm full of shit, or if they do realize
it, it is often too painful to deal with
so they pretend, because of their
awareness, they are exempt from
what they think of others.

I have been struggling with these
ideas since I have entered this insti-
iutioii (bureaucracy). It was so much
nicer when I was a first year, how—
ever It was a lot easier to tell people
what I thought Now, because ofmy
struggles With certain questions, I am
less willing to give my position.

luscd to loathe feminism, This was
a very reactionary posnion I took up
upon coming to this school In high
school I never dealt with issues like
these. Feminism WanUSI a word. A
word I often associated with the pews
ers of good instead ofevil, But then
I came here and I felt that while fcllllr
nists on campus were completely ige
noiani ofanyonc’s existence but there
own. But hey, isn't everyone? This
is what we must struggle against. I

If there is one thing that I Iiavc
learned in my four long (I hesitate to
say interminable) years here, it is
this: all professors are NOT created
equal. While the flashy viewbooksl
memorized while applying here had
convinced me that all the professors
were approximately as exerting as
the Matterhorn at Disneyland (minus
the line), I found. much to my dise
may, that this was not the case. In
fact, many of them were actually
more like an infinite loop ofthe It’s
aSmall World ride. This is not to say
that they were all grating in the same
way. However, I did find that most
of them in into one of several con-
venient categories.

The first Prof. I was able to catego~
rize is what] would term the Themed
Professor. These types are most eas-
ily discerned by the notes that stu-
dents take during the class. For in»
stance, last year I took a class where
I wrote two things (and only two
things) in my notebook every day,
“images washing overus" and “bird-
cage." I have no idea what either of
the phrases mean now. Ofcourse, the
random cross—hatched designs thatI
drew in the margins of every page
suggest that 1 didn't have much of ii
clue (or interest) then, either.
Another imponant category was the
Nothing But Notes Professor. These
professors are much like trains. You
can expect disaster if you get them
off track, Generally, they wtll read
their lecture notes in an efficient,
monotone voice. If someone asks a
question, they will look at the stu
dent like a startled animal, and siute
ter for a moment as their eyes dart
around the classroom. seeming to
search fora convenient tree to scam
per up and i‘lde,

Professors Without a Plan provide

OPINION

lical simple random sample. They
rarely bring books to class, and will
ramble at length about topics with no
discernible link to the homework aSv
blgllmcnls. Taking notes is superﬂu—
ous ill these classes. since they will
have no bearing on tests, papers, or
any other assignments. Unfortu-
nately. lhcsc professors often inspire
so much fcai (or apaihy) that no one
will ever ask ifhc or she is lecturing
for the incorrect .

Ono ofthc most frustrating types of
instructors is the Conilcscending Pro-
fessor. I find these most often in
classes whose description begins
“For thc non-majoring student." My
freshman year, I was told in one of
these classes that if I mixed a yellow
liquid and a blue liquid, they would
create a green liquid. I was not overly
thrilled that I was paying $20,000 a
year for knowledge I could acquire
from a Ziploc commercial.

Kindergarten Professors are per-
haps the most deceiving. Although
they are usually as bubbly as alkae
seltzcr and have activities which re
quire group hugs and crayons, they
will trick you They will tell you that
they genuinely care about your feele
ings and anxieties and emotional
baggage, but be wary. You may
boldly classify the class asablow off.
And you Will never get anything
above a B-.

Finally, and thankfully, there are the
exceptions. The Deities. The Gods.
They are brilliant, funny. and insight-
ful, and they believe their students
are the same. They are fair, honest,
and always give the beneﬁt of the
doubt. Most students ﬁnd one or two
in their college career, and take three
or four classes taught by them sim-
ply io bask in their presence.

Of course, there are professors who
don‘t fit into these categories, and
others who seem to fit in more than
one. Unfortunately, it's impossible to
avoid most oftlicsc categories. This
is not to say that I recommend that
you don't try; the add/drop deadline
is 5 p in. today. Iwish you luck,

Does Not Become Me

tion of black women in America and
gradually realized that I was doing
the same thing I had accused white
feminists ofdoing.

Not only was I positioning myself
as Other, but I was allowing white
feminists to relegatc me to this cute
cgory also. I was letting them offihc
hook while makingmyselfrcprcseir
tative of all black women. If you
want to know about me— a black
woman from the predominantly
black side of Chicago, educated in
mostly white schools, and poor for
most ofhcr life— I can talk for hours
But when is it okay for ME to speak
about the experiences of other black
women. and is it okay'.7 This is the
root of my problem and the source
of my speechlessness. I ﬁnally fige
ured out it was not okay to position
myself as Other from white women
because when I do this, it alleviates
white people’s responsibility to learn
about black women, in orderto only
understand oppressmn and how it
operates, you have to struggle alone.
Explanations cannot be handed to
you or you’ll never understand. It is
not my responsibility to make you
understand.

But here's my conflict. Who is go
ing to point these things outifItlon't?
I most definitely want things pointed
out. What am I supposed to do when
I hear blatantly racxst remarks come
out of other people’s mouths? Is it
okay then to say something7 What
does it mean ifI do respond? What
is my responsibility? What isn‘t my
responsibilityi This is why I can‘t
talk

In order to dismantle one kind of
oppression you must dismantle all
oppression. Racism willconlinue as
long as the patriarchy is in place. So
will classism, cgcisiii etc. etc. etc,
All oppressions work hand in hand
and I think few of the oppressed ic-
alizc this lt/is not okay to stay within
your comfort zone. You will never
gain equal rights for women if you
shroud yourself in traditional feiiii—
nist politics and philosophies Rac—
Ism will never be eradicated If liti-

tionalism is your game and you
refuse to study mainstream academia
and/or cultui e. You must understand
your oppressor and the nature of op-
pression in the big scheme ofthings.

Ofcourse, we all have our own deﬁ-
nite experiences and those are what
we are most knowledgeable about.
But we must remember we are not
alone. We are not contestants in a
game show, either. Know your own
history, and be knowledgeable about
specific things you are interested in
and can speak to your experiences,
but don't shut others out. Don‘t be
an egotist.

Grinnellians GoingAbmad: Be
Careful and Wise

Just like the brochure. My right
foot hung over the edge of the
Himalayan foothills. Liu Yu Wang
read me a poem he‘d written com-
memorating our time ofdrunken con-
versation on my dorm balcony in
Beijing. Professor Su was a Jesuit
monk, then a Taoist monk, then a
Buddhist monk, and he told me
that he healed his landlady's back
ache using his powers of chi, Fel-
low American‘Sarah burst on to the
club dance floor directed by the Chi-
nese mldgetDI with dyed blond hair.

The brochures for study abroad in
China didn‘t disappoint. I had left
America for exotic lands, and arrived
in exotic lands. There were gold
shining monuments, grim unfriendly
faces,jungles and snow, hushed po~
litical discussions with Han people,
Shanghai’s mobile phone obsession,
and clogged buses in the capital. Iex-
perienced the experience of a life-
time, just like the brochures said.

Far more valuable than exotica,
however, were the blackeandewhite
boring realities I learned about of be—
in g an American abroad: Americans
are everywhere and everyone abroad
knows it. Our country created the
world order,
controls most of the money, controls
information flow, says what is good
and what is bad, and doles out re-
wards and punishments accordingly.

My Study Abroad Brochure would
contain the following. Studying
Abroad: A tremendous responsibil-
ity. You’re responsible for your
country’s domination of the world
order. You're responsible for
McDonalds in the cities of Eastern
Europe. You're responsible for the
30 dollars/hour the Chinese business-
man pays you to learn English so he
can get more money. You’re respon-
sible forAfrican children who'llcling
to your leg for a dziy without hunger.
You’re responsible for drunken walks
back to the diplomatic compound,

Needless to say, my travel brochure
would not sell. No glossy pictures
of clean bright students holding an
emaciated baby‘s body. No embroi-
dered “ethnic“ wear or dangling sil~
verjewelry, And no geared»up hik-
ers exploring mountain scenery.

Let‘s avoid the urge to idealize and
fetishize foreign cultures. After put-
ting down your study abroad bro-
ehure, pick up a history book about
yo‘urcoun‘try ofchoiee. Studying and
Working abroad should be about
respect, responsibility, patience and
understanding.

When you’re on the airplane to
abroad. you’ll be excited, scared,
sad, and happy for yourself all at
once. When you get off the plane,
however, I ask that you be wise and
careful too. Studying abroad is re-
ally not about your life-building ex»
perience. It’s about the place you‘re
going.
