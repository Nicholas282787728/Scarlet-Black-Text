new means to entertain
Ritalin Test Squad Takes Off

BY MAX MULLER
Staff Writer

“181 athletic supports walk into a
bar,“ said a member of the Ritalin
Test Squad to a full house at Bob’s
Underground Coffee House, “they
order a pitcher of beer, and the bar-
tender asks, ‘how many cups do you
want with that?“ The response to
this joke was mostly chuckles, al-
though there were a few roars of
laughter, a hiss, and “boo" or two.
Puns have been called the lowest
form of humor. but you have to give
the comedian some credit. He came
up with the joke on the spot under
the critical eye of his peers. The
Ritalin Test Squad is Grinnell's
improv comedy troop.

Last Friday night at Bob‘s the
Ritalin Test Squad did their second
performance ever. The group, in its
ﬁrst year on campus, is led by Chad
Hines '00. Hines led a similar improv
troop in high
school for 2
years, and
started the
Ritalin Test
Squad last
fall. The
group has
ﬁfteen mem
bers who

Theirperfor-
mance on
Friday was
truly funny.
The audie
ence was
activly in
volved and the actors appeared to be
having the time oftheir lives. “It was
good for where we are now, and I
hope to do better in the future,” said
Hines, “and we are continuing to
evolve.“

The group’s improv performances
.are made up of many different
games. The rules of each game out
line the structure of the performance.
but the acting is improvised. In most
games, the audience is involved by
suggesting a starting point for the
actors or a theme for the game and
from there, the actors take it where
ever their imagination goes.

According to Hines, one of the
most popular games is ”freeze and
justify." For this game, two members
of the troop stand center stage with
the rest of the troop spread out in a
line behind them. Members of the
audience are called on to contort the
two actors' bodies into random posie
tions, When the game begins. the
actors pretend that they are in a situ-
ation that ﬁts the position, Through
their acting they begin to tell a story.
After a few seconds, another mem
ber of the troop yells “freeze." The
actors on center stage freeze in place
and the third actor comes onto the
stage and takes the place of one of
the ﬁrst two. When the skit resumes,
the story is changed to ﬁt new posie
tion that the actors are in. The game
continues, with members of the troop
yelling freeze whenever they see an

Grinnell audience is
like tickling a large,
hairy monster. You
don ’t know ifiz will
laugh or bite your
head of,”

opportunity for thc skit to lake ti new
direction. In this way, the troop acts
out a dozens of scenes, each lusting
seconds.

Another game the troop per
formed laleriday was “181" For this
skit, member of the troop yell out
jokes of the form “18l something
walk into a bar..." The audience pron
vtdes the “something" that will be the
subject ofthejokes In another. more
complicated game called
schmepordy. three or four of the ac»
tors are assigned roles by the audi-
cnce. such at a priest or a prostitute,
They then act as if they are contes-
tants on Jeopardy. The audience
gives the answer and the contestants
provide the questions. Another skit
has the audience assign four or ﬁve
actors roles as authors. The audience
also determines a starting point
From there, the actors tell a story in
the voice ofthe author they are play-
ing. Another actor acts as a pointer,
r an d o m l y

who will take
overthestory
telling every
few seconds.

Acc orde
ing to Hines,
“acting in
front of a
Grinnell aUr
dience is like
tickling a
large, hairy
monster. You
don'tknow if
it will laugh
or bite your
head off."
Hines says that when the audience
knows the actors, they tend to be
more critical. Alden Hoot ‘00, an—
other member ofthe troop, said that
the only way he performs well is to
dope up on caffeine prior to the per»
formance, At the group’s practices
each Saturday, Hines says that he
tries to make sure that each member
ofthe troop make a total fool of him-
self once or twice in order to grow
comfortable acting in front of their
peers and being a comedian extemr
poraneously.

One of the biggest problems the
troop runs into. says Hines, )5 when
they get into a situation and can find
no way out. “We can always get
stancd, but we have a hard time ende
ing the games." To improve on this,
the troop has a drill where they must
make a game continue, building on
itself for up to half an hour. Now
matter what situation the actors get
into, they must ﬁnd a way out, An-
other problem the group faccs is the
danger that the performances will
lose their originality. According to
Hines, when you know a situation
that is funny. it‘s hard to resist the
temptation to take the skit in that die
rcction. Hincs says that in practice,
when a certain theme recurs too of
ten, they ban it and force each other
to be original.

Music poll results pose question: Is

Grinnell really diverse in taste?

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

Walking through the college resie
dertces. one can here the sounds of
the folk-soundingdurnedemnine
stream sounds ofAni DiFranco, the
sounds oansts, Kula Shaker and the
second British Invasion, the techno
sounds of Orbital, the Latin beats of
Pancho Sanchez, the death metal of
Megadeth. “Music on campus is
very diverse."says‘firslyenr student
PeterCorsale. “BaSically pcoplclis-
ten to everything here. Hoivever, the
bands on campus and the music
brought in to campus is not repre-
sentative of the musical listening.
You can go to Gardner and you can
go to the Hams Center and there is
no in between," says Corsale.

The view expressed by Corsalc
was echoed by numerous other stu
dents, who described music as die
verse on campus, but what is being
emphasized as much more exclusive.
This popular music of the campus
seems to change very rapidly Ac
cording to many students, the folk
like elements that have been an em-
phasized part ofthe musical culture
the last couple of years on campus is
quickly fading. Coi-saie evidences
this change by simply stating. “Folk
guitar is crap musicl"

The new fnd that seems to be
sweeping across campus is the en-
ergy and danceable excitement of
Ska. Coming offofthc exciting con-
cert last semester featuring three big
ska bnnds ochel Big Fish, Let’s Go
Bowling and Chcrryroppin' 13nd—
dies, the campus has been buzzing

“A wonder to behold... breathtakingly talented... one
ofthefew artists around who can really paint the rainbows. ”

with excitement over what is to many
a foreign musical form. This semese
let even featured a SKA night at Hare
ris DJ’cd by Eric Fischer and run by
Loose Hall, Many students ex—
pressed a belief that Ska seems to
maintain the energy and adrenaline
rush of the Grinnell punk years, but
with a gentler, less destructive feel.
The hardcore/punk scene that has
been described as prominent in the
early 1990‘s, when such punk powe
erhouses as Chicago based chboy
visited campus. scems to have extin-
guished it's ability to capture cam.
pus attention, Student James Rech‘s,
a member of the campus band Maele
strom, says lhatf‘For my first two
years here, I felt like every band that
came to campus was too loud and
had too much of a punk flavor. At
that point, I felt that that‘s what
people liked; because that‘s what
kind of bands were playing here.”
Reclis feels that mnsked underneath
this overwhelming mass ofhardcote
there was whole diverse range of
musical preferences and musical tal-
ent. Ultimately, while the music that
thrives on campus and that is brought
influences people’s tastes on campus,
Junior Claire Rambo expresses her
belief that “We all come to campus
with a certain taste in music and
we‘re not going out searching for
new kinds when we get here.”
Sophomore Brian Cochran also her
licvcs that people come to campus
With "their musical interests already
set," but adds that “if people hear
something different that they like,
they will still listen to it."

Some students expressed concern
ovctccrtain types ofinusic that never
seem to get campus wide recogni-
tion. Corsale commented that
“there’s no R & B, no country even
though there are most likely a good
amount of country fans." Rambo
commented on how the campus
“doesn‘t get any hipehop or pop acts "
While certain types of music may be

underrepresented, Rambo also made
it known that she feels that the “past
couple of years them has been more
diverse music brought in." Because
of this increased tlivcrsity. Rechs
says, “I've been glad to sec that
many people have turned out for
theseshows [this year] and it proves
people really do have OK musical
tastes on this campus.

Rambo concurs, saying that
“people seem to be getting more in
volved," but that the addition of title
other taste to the recipe has helped
to make concerts this year a success,
She simply states, “there’s beet
served,“ With numerous student
groups helping out With iheconcerts
this year, it has opened up the op
tion of having alcohol. The combi-
nation of music and alcohol has ul-
timalely proved an irresistibly
groovy concoction that has drawn
huge numbers of people to Harris.

The new fad that
seems to be
sweeping across
campus is the
energy ofSka.

Some people still reminisce on
years past in Grinncll’s popular mile
sic history, when groups such as
Soul Asylum and Smashing Pump~
kins played in Gdfdncl, below their
popularexplosron. Dcspitc ourcon-
nection with these populni music
icons, the connection to the popular
music of the offeeampus world
seems incredibly distant. thii
asked about what iicw music he Its»
tuned to front thc outside, Corsnlc
replied. “I don't know, I‘m in Grin-
nell, we’ic not in populnrctilturc "

The new music that has swept

across the country and is already be-
ing seen us the rcplocement of the fad-
ing fast grunge movement is the beat-
bnsed music called Techno. Sweep-
ing the country and slipping into the
pages of such unoriginal mainstream
magazines as SPIN, techno seems to
have been infusctl into popular cul-
ture. With the names of bands such
as the Chemical Brothers, Prodigy
nnd Aphex Twin, techno is rocketing
onto the country’s airwaves. Whether
this new style of music will be able
to withstand it's classiﬁcation by
many critics as a simple “regurgita-
tion of beats“ that is not exciting
enough live, remains to be seen. Stun
dents, when asked if they thought
techno was compatible with Gn'nnell,
seemed to come to the conclusion that
as long as it has a dance beat it can
become populttr, As Senior Brian
Mundy snys, “I, as n music lover. feel
best when most ofthe students are at
some concert shaking their asses to-
gcthcr,"

However, whether the people
dancing to Gloria Gaynor in Harris
and to Mojo Machine in Gardner can
turn into techno frcttks is still up for
debate. A numbcrofpeople don‘t see
techno sweeping across the campus
as it is doing across the rest of the
country, One second year said, “I
don’t see techno ever becoming popue
lnr on campus. I can personally lise
ten to techno for fifteen minutes ifI'm
not dancing. lJusl can’t sit still."

Grinncll Collcgc is a campus that
likes to remain both on the cutting
edge and maintain it's own musical
flavor, likes to dance and likes to as
student Bcn Nussbaum describes use
music to “define themselves as being
undefined." Mundy comments that
he thinks that “the music scene, in
terms ol‘livc music in Grinncll is very,
very wettk tind could be improved."
