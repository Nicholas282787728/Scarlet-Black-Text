Neil Martin ’99, a Grinncll Col-
lege student. reportedly suffered
bruised knuckles, stitches on his up
per left thigh, and severely bruised
ribs as aresult ofa confrontation with
a Capra lii'rritr or a domesticated
goat.While it is unclear whatexactly
transpired on the evening of Satur-
day March 1, 1997, more details are
beginning to surface.

“While I was collecting soil
samples from nearby firms as part
of an unapproved biology experi
ment, this goat kept eyeing me, and
I had to take care of it." Martin rcr
sponded in defense ofaccusations of
inhumane treatment of animals and
goat-beating,

The owner of the goat after ob-
serving the altercation, called police,
Arriving at the scene of the reported
beating, the officer on duty revived
the goat through artificial respiration

and CPR. The goat was then rushed
to the Grinnell College Health Cen-
ter for emergency treatment. Martin,
upon realizing the extent ofthe heat
ing, was reinorseful.

"ljust lost control. The stress of
inidsems wa iust too much. It Just
happened so ft, . I am sorry , . . so
sorry. I've gone and talked to the
farmer and I brought the goat a little
present some apples. I just
couldn't think ofaiiything else goats
like."

According to goal expert Brenda
J Kim wlto has a pit D, in psycholr
ogy front the University of Minne-

sota, goats often make eye contact ‘

as a sign ofat'fection and playfulness.
In her recently published study, she
found that in ninety-ﬁve percent of
the goat-beating cases goats were not
at fault “It is u contmon misconcep-
tion that goats are aggressive and
belligerent creatures. when in fact
they are fun-loving and affectionate
beings. Awareness and lniilual re-
spect for goats is crucial for better
humanrgoat relations," said Kim.

Because this was Martin’s first
offense, the farmer chose not to press
charges for “manhandling” but re-
portedly is seeking a restraining or-
deragainstMartinoffleerTimSittig
of the Grinnell Police Department
said that goat—beating cases could be
prosecuted under “animal cruelty
statues" but added that most cases are
considered misdemeanors and not
serious offenses. We'd try to handle
[the goatrbcaling] like any other in
Vestigzttion."

Director of Student Affairs Tom
Crady said that he “does not encour-
age [goatrbeating], that's for sure."

 

Doty and Victor speak
on death penalty

Duo are members of Iowans
Against the Death Penalty

BY NGOC L01

Barbara Doty and David Victor.
members of Iowans Against the
Death Penalty, spoke in the South
Lounge of the Forum last Saturday
to petition student support against the
death penalty. Their work is part ofa
statewide effort to combat the rein-
statement ofthe death penalty, which
Governor Branstad hopes will pass
with a Republican majority in the
legislature. Doty and Victor spoke
with the premise that “when we
speak to groups we never make as
sumptions that people are on our side
or against us,”

Doty put forth the virtues of Iowa
as a church-based state to zirguc
against the morally degrading effects
of the death penalty. According to
her, the consequences of a reinstated
death penalty would blemish Iowa‘s
commitment to preserving individual
rights,

Victor also argued against the deaili
penalty, Discrimination, he said.
causes “black people [to be] dispro-
portionately the victims ofthe death
penalty," Victor noted that not only
is “the race ofthe vietim..,reaiiy para»
mount, but you also have to factor in
the class ofthe person." For example,
in the case of O J. Simpson. Victor
said, wealth was a great determining
factor.

Victor also noted that the death penr
alty is arbitrary, “You factor in the
probabilities," he said. “and if you
consider the color of the skin and
lack of adequate counsel, then you
skew the balance [against minorities
and the poor],"

In addition, Victor pointed out that
in the past innocent people have been
executed.

Throughout their presentation, VIC~
tor and Doty referred to the death
penalty as a moral issue "I don‘t
want to play God,“ Victor said. He
and Doty said they believe that many
death penalty supporters are “will-
fully ignorant, know tlic facts and
they don't care."

, The two questioned audience mem-

bers how they would feel had it bceit
their child who was condemned to
death, Assuming that most people
would be distressed, Victor and Doty
contended that should the opposite
situation occuri should one‘s child
be murdered 7 it is better to over-
come the tragedy than to seek the
death penalty for the murderer.

Vrctor noted that it costs more to
execute people. Victor concluded that
the death penalty was not an effec-
tive or fair way ofdeallng with crime.
“We’ve gone a long way froin ex-
ecuting people for pick-pocketing,"
Victor said. “The very fact that
there’s an issue over the death peiir
ally says it lot about our movement
to where we should be."

He compared the death penalty to
slavery, saying how most of us new
recognize it as evil even though it is
still practiced in places like Saudi
Arabia. He then urged that the U.S.,
as a progressive country, should tolr
low Western Europe's example in
abolishing the death penalty

“The ottly way we can reform the
legal system [comes] from people
who have a different consciousness
than those currently running it." he
said. The pair ended their speech
with the words, "We have hope. We
have hope "

Several audience members found
that the speakers’ position on the
death penalty reﬂected their own. “I
oppose the death penalty for the same
reasons I become a conscientious
objector, which is because I feel killr
mg is wrong," said Kent McClelland,
a sociology professor. “I don‘t want
to be involved in air organization that
kills pcoplcjust like I don‘t want to
be involved in a statc that kills
people "

McClelland said he believes that all
effective solution to crime has noth-
ing to do wrtli the death penalty or
the criminal justice system, but With
a social policy that creates social
conditions which counteract crime
Mohamed ial’i'cr ‘99 agreed, snyino
that criminals are not born crimint ,
but made into criminals by society.
He called the death penalty inllumaii

Body Image Task Force founder gives talk

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Staff Writer

When Dawn Atkins, founder and
past directoroftlie Body ImageTask
Force, signed up fora college course
called “The Human Body From a

‘ Cultural Perspective," she said she

did not realize that it would spawn a
more than decade-long commitment
to changing social attitudes about
body image.

A current candidate for her PILD.
inArithropolngy at the University of
Iowa, Atkins spoke to Grinnelliaiis
March 4 in South Lounge. Her prCr
scntatioii was pain of a symposium
sponsored by the Noun Program in
Women’s Studies. Gill Wright
Miller,Associate Professor produce
and Women's Studies at Denison
University. will give the final prescnr
tation in the series, “Pregnant Perr
foniiance: Fruit of the Womb" at 2
pm. today.

Since Atkins’ interest in body im-
age began, she has given over 100
speeches on behalfof the Body Im-
age Task Force, an organization dedi-
cated to providing speakers and edu-
cational materials and sponsoring
programs that promote the accep-
tance of diversity, Atkins speaks to
schools, health care providers, and
appears on talk shows such as Oprah
Winfrey and Larry King,

When Atkins decided to do research
on cultures which value fat women,
she said she began to learn about “the
way that weight is an oppressor for
women."This led to furtherlesearch
which grew to dominate her under
graduate experience

Atkins said she incorporates the re
sults of her research into speeches
which arm to educate people about
misconceptions regarding appear-
ance.

“What I do isit't therapy," she said.
“What I do is vel'y' similar to what

people call consciousness raising,
which is a way oi’saying that my 15*
sues with my body, your issues with
your body are not individual prob-
lems, These are social problems that
affect all of us."

Atkins kicked off her presentation

to Grrnricll College by discussing
what she termed “looksisni,” or dis-
crimination based on looks Atkins
also discussed sexism, racism,
classisnr, a_ ism, nbleism and
heterosexism
as they re-
late to

judgements
of body inl~
age.
Atkins Cfltlr

scritations

pointing to a recent contest in which
40,000 women were encouraged to
submit photographs to a mode]
agency, and only three were chosen
as potential model material.

“How can such a small portion of
the population represent what
women are supposed to look like?"
Atkins said. “Have you ever seen
African American models? They
look like inked in versrons of white
models," Atkins chastised the diet
industry for setting weight standards
that do not even apply to most races
or etlinieities,

The idea that “you can nevei be too
rich or too thin," seems to prevail iii
the U.S., Atkins said. She then
pointed outthat studies show that this
often becomes a self fulfilling proph-
ecy as the overweight women find
career advancement wrought with

obstacles Overweight woriieii, she
said, often are trapped iii the lower
class because of an untllterablc ge—
netic trait.

The mayor problems among people
who face discrimination lend to be
about assimilation to the ltledlzlrch
tcrmincd cultural body "norm."
Atkins said, Conversely, members or
groups that traditionally have been
discriminated against who live wrtliiti
strong communities tend to over»

and the
same is trite of strong lcshiaii comr
niuniti .Thus it is not the groups
themselves, but those around them,
that perpetuate the myth of the ideal
body, Atkins said

After pinpointing the flaws of dis-
criiiiinatitin based on appearance.
Atkins turned herdiscussion to medir
cal manipulation She criticized
weight charts as the product of
skewed reasoning
“You’re taking a genetic variation
and trying to fit people into it," she
said. ill-defined guidelines such as
these lead the weight-obsessed down
u path of slow starvation and cart
cause diet-induced obesity when they
begin to eat again, she said.

According to Atkins, most modern
studies on weight have been funded
by the diet industry, and almost all
overweight subiects already have

women.

been on several diets in the past, It
is this proclivity to “yoryo"diets, and
not the weight itself, Atkins conr
tended, that is the cause of health
failures among liiost obese Ameri-
cans today

Finally, Atkins looked toward the
future for solutions

"Do we change our bodies, or do
we change out culture?" she asked
In order to change body image prob
leiiis iii today’s society, Atkins said,
people must accept their own bodies
and refuse to put up with negative
cultural messages,

"It doesn‘t take that much to have a
big iiiipact.”Aikiiis noted, encoura
ing listeners to complain to advertis~
crs or iiiagnyuics lliat perpetuate the
myth of the ideal body and to praise
lliosc advertisers or magazines that
don‘t.

Atkins currently is working on her
Phi), iii Anthropology on the femi-
nist track at the University of Iowa.
In addition she is about to publish a
book titled Lao/ting QiicersBodyIm-
age and Mandy in Lesbian, Bi:
sexual, car. and Transgendered
Contour/lilies.

Atkins' speech was part ofa symr
pnstum entitled "Women's Bodies:
Women's Health" broughtto campus
by the Noun Program in women’s
studies Also included in the sympo»
siurn was the March 5 presentation
of “Environmental Sexism: The
Industry’s involvement with the Link
of Chlorine to Breast Cancer" by
Joan D'nrgo, Coordinator ofthe Na
tional Coalition for Health and En
vrronmental Justice.

The Noun Committee aims to eXr
plore implications of the new femir
nist scholarship. to increase an un-
derstanding of international femi-
nisms, and to explore ways in which
the study of women is being trans-
formed by new perspectives on race,
class and gender,

“No human or human laws should
have authority to decide who shall
live or who shall die," he said. Cecily
Wagner also opposed the death pens
alty, saying it is racist, classist and
unjust. “By killing the person who
did the murder," she said, “you‘rciust
wasting another life that has the po
tential to do good."

But while the speech served to re
inlbree many people's opposition to
the death penalty, some people i'elt
itdid not take into consideration pOSr
sible pro-death penalty arguments.
William Crosby, a resident of
Grinncll, said he continues to waver
between supporting and rejecting the
denih penalty. “I would have liked to
hear a pro-death pcnalty argument,"
Crosby said.

Some negative implications of the
speech were also relt by members of
the audience. “I felt slightly that they
were talking down the people who
were for the death penalty," Crosby
noted. Both Victor and Doty implied
that opposition to the death penalty
denoted progressiveness,

"[Tlley] shouldn't focus on being
bctter than others," Wagner said in
response. “I think that's focusing on
the wrong issue totally. You have to
look at the specrfrc reasons why a
country has the death penalty. You
can't jusl say ‘your country is bad,
you have the death penalty.”

"1 don't think that sarcallcd progress
IS a good it uriient," Crosby agreed,
“We have a tendency to think our
own way [of dotng things] is more
improved "

When questioned about some of the

negative implications of the preseiir
tation, Doty Saltl‘ “We're for
multiculturalism and all that . We
don't want to cast a stain on any so-
ciety regardless of whether or not
they have the death penalty."
"I respect all that they're doing work
mg against the death penalty." Mall
Loren]. said. “I think they gave us
some ideas to think about,"

Although the campus group has
been in contact with legal council,
they are not currently pursuing legal
action.

“Lawsuits are not what we're here
to focus on. We’re not here to win
battles," Pallas said.

The College. following standard
protocol for issues concerning the
nondiscrltiiinatlon policy, has sought
legal advrse,

“We’ve consulted legal counsel
about this issue," said Frank Thomas

special assistant to the President.

Thomas Crudy, dean of student
affairs, is currently forming a group
to examine the College‘s nondis-
crimination policy.

Letters to the Griiinell Hrmlrl-
Re’glri‘rr from Gnilnell residents have
been highly critical ofthe College’s
decision. “I‘ve received letters front
town about this." Crarly said.

Rich Millikcn. associate minister
of tlie Grinnell Christian Churchv
said he supports Intcharsity’s influ-
ence in the College community. and
was displeased by the decision
“We are frustrated that that group had
been singled out based on its faith
principles," he said "We anticipated
that decision. but we wish that there
was another way to resolve it "
