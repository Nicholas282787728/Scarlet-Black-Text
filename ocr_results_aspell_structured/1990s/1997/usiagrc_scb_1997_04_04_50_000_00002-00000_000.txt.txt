Balinese ceremonial music by Colin
MePhce. McPhee was an early
ethnomusicologist who spent many
years in Bali, where he transcribed
the musicintoWestern composition,

According to Ferrigno, these Ba-
linese pieces require the pianist io
”dismiss all Western emotional ex-
pression." The Balinese pieces will
include “Pemoengkah,” a piece used
to open the shadow~play in a fonri
of entertainment derived from Hindu
religious ceremony. “Taboeh Teloe"
is a piece performed in ceremonies
such as temple feasts or cremations.

Ferrigno says, “1 am most sure this
is a Grinnell premiere for these
pieces."
