Pioneers hit the road this Week

Sports Information

The Grinnell College women’s
basketball team hits the road for two
more Midwest Conference contests
this week. Thursday the Pioneers
play at Coe and Saturday they travel
to Illinois College.

Coe and Illinois College are both
formidable opponents for the
cagers. In 1996, both foes were
play-off teams and are strong con-
tenders again this season. “I hope
we can play with some emotion at
Coe because they are an in-state ri»
val. When we play IC it will be our
second time through in the division.
We want to Close the gap a little,"
commented Coach Jenny Wood.

Grinnell remained winless last
week. falling in three games to con-
ference opponents. Knox prevailed

43-2] on Monday. Lake Forest won
70722 on Friday and Beloit posted
a 60.20 win on Saturday

“We have to be realistic about what
we can do," explained Coach Wood.
“In practice we’re working to build
a base of fundamentals. There is
nothing wrong with admitting that.
We have to look at the long-term
gain rather than the short-term out-
come,”

There have been some individual
bright spots for the Pioneers.
Rookie Mandi Hill ‘00 posted an-
other double—double against Knox
with ll rebounds and 10 points.
She also scored 11 points against
Beloit. Additionally. small forward
Sally Goodspccd ‘98 has been
shooting more consistently and get-
ting better looks at the basket.
“Sally's perimeter game is coming

around and she seems more aggres~
sive offensively, Mandi is up and
down. We really need to get her
more shot attempts," said Wood.

To compound Grinnell’s troubles,
point guard Kristen Melby '99 has
been fighting a leg injury for a
month. Over the weekend Coach
Wood gave the job to Jocie Luglio
‘99 and she rose to the occasion.
“Iocie was a little shaky Friday but
that was nerves. She came back Sat-
urday and handled the ball well. She
may have earned herself a starting
position,” Wood said.

“We are really trying to create an
awareness of where we are funda-
mentally," reﬂected Wood. “Our
theme last weekend was to realize
our limitations. We cannot be sat»
lsﬁed with where we are but we are
deﬁnitely in a rebuilding situation.“

Women swimmers edge ,
Luther in Grinnell Invitational

With the Iowa small college meet
drawing near and with the Midwest
Conference meet only two weeks
after that, the Grinnell College
women‘s swim team is bringing it all
together at just the right time.

Followtng an intensive training exe
cursion to Florida, the team imme
diately began to show signs of im.
provement. “People usually react to
the winter training in one of two
ways," commented Coach Erin
Hurley regarding the Florida trip,
“Either they feel refreshed, as if they
were tapering down after an intene
sive period. or they become tircd 0n
the whole I think the trip did us a lot
of good. We were able to practice
together, work hard, and bond as a
team,"

The Pioneers reaped the beneﬁts
from that hard work over the week-
end by taking first place at the
Grinnell Invitational. Grinnell edged
out in-state rival Luther to take the
winner’s plaque. 488-472. “It was a
great-meet for our entire team," noted
Coach Hurley. “With the season
winding down. we have been able to
use our winter training to post times
that are season bests, and in some

cases lifetime bests."

Headlining the effort for the Mad
Ducks was senior captain Morgen
Cheshire ‘97, the team's top indie
vtduzil scorer with 50 points, She ﬁne
lshed second in both the 100 and 200
free along with third in the 200 back
stroke. Junior Lizz Welch '98

“With the season
winding down we have
been able to use our
winter training to past
times that are season
bests, and in some

cases lifetime bests.”
"Couch Erin Hmldy

complemented the effort by winning
the 3M divmg event and lo
Schaalman ‘00 also captured ﬁrst in
the 1M divrng.

Aside from the usual strong shown
lngS by Cheshire and the divers,
Coach Hurley’s squad produced
somepleasanlsul‘prlses. Lisal-laberl
(-00) asserted her skills, earning a

victory in the 200 breaststroke.
Haberl’s performance is especially
impressive considering that she was
unable to join the team during the
ﬁrst semester. Hurley also praised
the efforts of another freshman, C.
C. LaGrange. “C. C, is improving
beyond belief in the 200 IM [5th
place]," commented I-Iurley. “We
knew nothing about her at the begin
ning of the year. Now she could be
a key contributor at the conference
meet.” _

With the Grinnell Invitational title
plaque as the latest addition to the
trophy case, the Pioneers are brim-
ming with conﬁdence as they head
into this week’s state meet at Cue in
Cedar Rapids. Coe will he the only
conference opponent at the meet, but
Hurley believes that it could be a
critical juncture for her team.

“This meet will ﬁnalize our plans
for ﬁlling events at the conference
meet which is also being held at
Coe," said l-lurlcy, This meet will
give us a chance to try out the pool
and get accustomed to the surround-
ings." The Pioneers are looking for
top performances not only to win
this weekend's meet. but also to de
velop the right mix to contend for
the Midwest Conference crown in

three weeks.

After splitting with four Midwest
Conference north division foes, the
Grinnell College men's basketball
team must now focus on their up-
coming south division opponents.
On Saturday, the cagemcn are trav~
cling to battle in»state rival Coo and
on Wednesday at 7:00 pm they host
another in-state competitor, Cornell.

Despite their 1996 division cham-
pionship, the Pioneers were rated by
loop coaches as only the third or
fourth best team in preseason polls.
The Pioneers, however, are in ﬁrst
place with a 5-3 record. Monmouth
is a close second at 3—3 and Knox is
third at 4,4_ Cornell and Coe, with
records of 2,4 and 474 respectively,
are also well within striking distance.
Grinnell has six crucial division
games remaining, two each against
Coe, Cornell and Monmouth.

“I thought in the beginning of the
season that the league was extremely
balanced and that has played out so
far. There are five teams with legitir
mate shots for the title in both divir
sions," commented Coach David
Arseneault. “We got out of the gate
early and have maintained fairly
strong play in the league. Now we
have to focus on the stretch run.”

Facing two of the north division’s
top teams last weekend, the Pioneers
hoped to utilize their home court ad-
vantage and,pull away from their di-
vision opponents. Friday night
Lawrence shot an immaculate 70%
from the floor in the first half, build-

ing a 19rpoint lead. The Pioneers
resiliently battled back in the second
half but in the end were defeated, 957
94. On Saturday the Grinnellians
bounced back with a 94—77 Victory
against St. Norbert.

Coach Arseneault felt the Pioneers
played well in both games. “Genere
ally you don’t look favorably on a
split when you are at home, but wnh
the strength of the north division
teams I thought our play was great,"
he said. “Everyone else in our divir
sion split too, so we have maintained
our lead and we’re one week closer
to the final standings."

Against Lawrence four Pioneers
scored in double ﬁgures. Jeff Clem-
ent ‘99 led the way with 26 points.
His clutch shooting at the end of the
ﬁrst half helped Grinnell cut the Vi-
king l9rpoint lead to 9 points. In one
of his best performances, Craig Al-
pha ‘98 knocked ill six of nine three
pointers for 18 points. Clayton
Kaneshiro ‘97 and James Decker ‘98
added 15 and ll points respectively.
Richard Wemer ‘99 came off the
bench to grab a teamrhigh six rer
bounds.

“The difference in the Lawrence
game was their point and post com-
bination. Their point guard was ex»
cellent in the open court and their
post finished quite well," noted
Arsenault.

In a mustrwin situation‘on Satur-
day, Clement remained hot and ru-
eled the team to victory. Scoring 25
points in the first half, the sophomore
pushed his squad to 859-45 ﬁrst half

Mad Dogs swimming strong
Cbach feels that team is much better this year

BY ERIC Rl'ENSCHE

After a solid performance at the
Grinnell Invitational last weekend,
the Grinnell College men’s swim
team is looking forward to mak-
ing strides this weekend at the
Iowa small college meet in Cedar
Rapids. “We are a much better
team than we were last year," com—
mented Coach Erin Hurley. “You
could not ask for more’effort than
these guys have given."

The Pioneers will need a strong
effort this weekend as they com-
pete against various small colleges
from all over Iowa, including cone
ferencc rival Coe. Because the
men's squad has a short roster, the

team lacks depth and will need
high places in almost every event
if they hope to keep pace with the
elite teams in the state.

Coach Hurley was no doubt
encouraged by some oflast week's
performances at the Grinnell lnr
vitaticnal. Notably, Derek
Fimmen '97 won the 1M diving
impressively. Freshman Nathan
Lueck also made a key contribu-
tion to the Pioneers? cause, finishr
ing as the team's top scorer. Lueck
finished second in both the 100
free and 50 free. Another fresh»
man. Aaron Severn, turned in a
solid day with a fourth-place rin.
ish in the‘ 500m and third-place
honors in the mile. Coach HurlEy

also mentioned the fine work of '

senior Jay Corrigan who demon-
strated his versatility by earning
third in the 200 backstroke, even
though he specializes in the sprint
freestyle events. Matt Peterson
‘97 and Brian McElroy ‘00 also
added several points to the effort.
With last weekend’s strong per-
formances to the spur them on, the
Mad Dogs are looking beyond the
state meet to the Midwest Confer-
ence championship meet a few
weeks away. “It should be a real
battle for second, third, and fourth
in the conference" commented
Coach Hurley. “Hopefully, we
will put together a strong meet this
weekend and then be ready to
make our move at conference."
