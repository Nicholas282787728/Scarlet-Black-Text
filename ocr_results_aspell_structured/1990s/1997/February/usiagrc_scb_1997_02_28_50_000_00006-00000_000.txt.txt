Vice-Presidential Statements of Intent

 

 

Rebecca Eilers

Representing Grinnell as a tour
guide my sophomore year, I enjoyed
conveying to others how invaluable
my experiences here have been to
me. Last semesterin London, I can
sistently read the 3&8 and found
myself wanting to be involved in the
issues back in Grinnell. It was
strange to hear ofissues weeks after
they hiicampus, and to hear of these
things when my input would have
been too late. Now back in Grinnell,
1 am very enthusiastic about being
directly involved. I am eager to rep-
resent the college as Vice-President!
President ofAcademic Affairs and to
be a facilitator of change and line
provement.

The position of SGA VP/PAA
works closely with the academic side
oflife at Grinnell, As a person seek»
ing Secondary English teaching cer-
tification. 1 am especially interested
in education as well as the workings

ofall types ofacaderntc institutions. ‘

My experience as a member of the
Education Department SEPC my
sophomore and junior years has al»
lowed me to become familiar With
and to work closely with faculty, ado
dressing student concerns as well as
establishing new guidelines to evalu-
ate professors. Involvement in many
activities, such as the Grinnell Singr
ers and the Grinnell Orchestra, has
taught me to effectively manage my
time and responsibilities efficiently.
In fact. participants in music en»
sembles function in much the same
way as members of SGA. Each in-
dividual must prepare outside of
scheduled meeting times so that
when we gather, we can work to
gether productively to achieve the
common goal. As for SGA, I believe
the common goal is maintaining self-
governance and seeking to improve
the campus and community. In or-
der for selfegovernance to work.
everyone‘sinputis needed. Thesup~
port and the ideas of the entire stu-

dent body are necessary for improve» .

' merits.

As VP/PAA, I would like to in-
crease the diverstty of the curricu-
lum. This semester‘s short course in
Native American literature is a start,
but why are there not any regularly

offered classes in this subject as well
as in Asian-American, Latino/an
American, and GLBT studies',7 Ml-
nority groups on campus deserve not
only Space, but formal ways of
studying and sharing their cultures.
1 am committed to increasing the
cultural diversity of the faculty to
best suit the needs of students. In
addition, many departments have too
few professors for the number Ofstur
dents enrolled. College literature
promotes the personal attention that
comes with a 10:1 student-faculty
ratio; yet, l00 and 200 level Spanish
courses have over 30 students which
makes practicing speaking difficult.
I also propose requiring professors
to distribute book lists before the end
of the semester so that students have
the opportunity to find books at a
lower cost during breaks. In addi-
tion, I am concerned with increasing
publicity and attention given to the
Fine Arts department. Another stu
dent publication is needed as a for
rum for students and faculty to share
their musical compositions, Lastly,
incoming students need to be family
lar with what the SEPC does so that

- it can be used to their advantage.

While students who have declared a
majorofteii receive information from
their departments' SEPC members,
students who have not declared a
major have no easy way to access a
list of SEPC members. The SEPC
can be a valuable resource for stUr
dents with questions about a 1118on
they are considering, and therefore
needs to be publicized. ’

SGA is the most important link be
tween students, faculty, and the Grinr
nell community, A successful leader
of SGA facilitates communication
between these diverse groups, repr
resenting the beliefs and goals ofthe
student body which may even be in
opposition to the leader‘s own he
liefs. Change takes time. but each
year’s SGA can build upon what past
administrations have accomplished.
The collective Voice of the student
body chooses its leaders and urges
change. With strong leadership and
increased student involvement, SGA
can be what we. the entire student
body, makes it,

Philip Bloch

The SGA Vice President] Presi~
dent of Academic Affairs acts as a
representative for concerns of the
student body and the faculty by
serving on several of the academic
and disciplinary committees on
campus. This is the position that 1
am running for, and my name is
Philip Bloch. I am a Michigan na-
tive and a student of both Biology
and Environmental Studies. From
time to time I have found myself
frustrated with the things happen-
ing around me, so instead of com—
plaining. I am choosing to run for
office and help offer solutions in
place of complaints. To hold an
administrative position requires
both organizational and listening
skills. I have demonstrated both of
these through my tenure as a Hall
Chair my sophomore year and my
service as a Student Adviser this
year. My dedication can be seen
through my continued participation
on the Track team, I believe that I
am the right candidate for this posir
tion, and hopefully, after reading
some of my ideas listed below, you
will agree.
- Primary among the purposes of
SGA officers is to represent the
campus community, This campus
is a democracy, if the SGA officers
don't represent the community, then
they aren‘t doing theirjob. It is the
duty of all interested individuals to
be proactive so I encourage all of
you to come to me with your ideas,
and I promise to offer an ear to any.
one.
— One thing we all realize is that ft-
nals week at Grinnell college each
semester
is a nightmare for many of us. I pro-
pose an extension of the buffer zone
between the end of classes and the
beginning of exams to enable stun
dents to better prepare for their er
ams . This means potentially end-

ing classes on the Wednesday be-
fore finals week. Also. in order to
accommodate students who

need to travel. I propose shifting the
open exam period from Monday af-
ternoon to Friday, This would en-
able students to leave no later than
Friday afternoon, and keep students
from ever being laden with two ex-
ams on the final day of the week.

- I am also aware that occasionally
there is a gap in the communications
between a student and a professor,
therefore I propose the creation of
an Academic Grievances Commit-
tee. This committee could fill the
void which exists between students
and their educators by hearing both
sides of the issues and advising a
solution.

vAClCllltOnally. we must reach out to
the surrounding community and be
active in it. As students we are only
interlopers in this area,-but we
should invtte the

community onto our campus and
into our classrooms. Doing so will
benefit everyone by adding perspec.
tive to our educational experience
and making us closer to the people
and events around us.

Finally 1 would like to thank you
for reading my statement of intent
and I hepe that some of what l said
struck a cord with you, These are
just a few of the many thoughts I
have. If you have any questions
about anything that 1 say here, or if
you have anything to add, please
don‘t hesitate to contact me, after
all an SGA Vice President must be
open to any and all comments.
Please do remember to vote on elec-
tion day (March 5th), and ifyou feel
like you need to knowlmore about
me, then please, I reiterate, contact
me.
