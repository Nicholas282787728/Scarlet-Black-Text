At the DeLong Classic, hosted by
Grinnell last weekend, the men’s

17 teams. Coach Will Freeman was
pleased with how the meet went:
“The weather was terrific. I was
thankful that we had a such a beauti-
ful day. Ithought we ran really well."

of his athletes, Freeman had quite a
bit to be happy about. In field events
Jeff Root ‘97 finished second in the
pole vault ataheight of 14' 7". Free-
man praised the performance of
Root, “He has been doing very well
in practice andI think he will be able
to vaulthigher than he did this week-
end. I am really happy with how he
has come along.“ Freeman also was
pleased with his javelin throwers,
Sean Cotton ‘97, Abel Zeleke ‘97
and Bryan Rebel ‘97, who all threw
personal bests. “I am really comfort»
able with how our javelin throwers

looked, “ he stated.

A strong perfomiance also came
from Matt Rhoadcs ‘99 in the 400
hurdles. He ﬁnished ﬁrm with a time
of 57.01. Freeman was pleased,
“Matt ran really well. He had been
sick most of the week, so it was nice
to see him come out and run so well."

While the sunshineefllled day had
a number of great moments for the
Grinnell men, it was a disappoint-
ment for the team to Watch as
Jeremiah Garza ‘99 went down with
a strained hamstring, “He leads the
conference in the long jump, and
now this. It’sjust frustrating, “ Freee
man commented.

As the athletes head off to
Simpson and Drake, the upcoming
conference meet is in the back of
their minds, Freeman stated, “We are
looking forward to hosting the con-
ference meet in three weeks. DeLon g
was a good dry run. Ithink the team
will be ready. Monmouth, Carroll and
Coe are the teams to beat,”

Without the name recognition of
a North Carolina, Kentucky or Arie

one of two paid players on one of

Brands joined a .

part time bas~

ranging in'age
from 25 to 30
years old. The

is taking the ex»
perience in
stride but is
somewhat am»
bivalent about
his newfound basketball environ
ment.

“Bremrehaven's'coachin g is deﬂ-
nitely suspect. There are more tal»
ented players [than in college] but the
play is just not as intense. At home
[in Bremrehaven] we would play in
frontof 300 or 400 fans, butI rememr

of the season but it was ridiculous.
The play in general was a lot slower
there and really less interesting than
over here. I mean, we didn’t have
any set offense. We were a lot bet
ter than the teams we played so we
ran all over them and won. The
other teams wouldn‘t guard me at
all—I guess they didn’t think I’d
shoot—and that kind of threw me,

Ed Brands, shown here driving in a game last year, continued
his career with a German semiepro team.

The [defender] would be behind the
threeepoint line and I didn’t know
what to do, drive foralay-up or take
the three."

German basketball teams are di—
vided by talent into three distinct
leagues. The top ﬁnishers in each
league advance to the league above
them the next season. Bremrehaven
competed last season at Germany‘s

ity of their oppo—
nents, finishing first
and securing a posi—
tion in the second
league next season.
Brands is planning
on returning to
Bremrehaven for a
taste of Germany‘s
next level but is not intent on staye
ing with the club or in German bas-
ketball, In fact, Brands holds an
unique outlook on professional base
ketball.

“I want to see other parts' of the
world and basketball is a good way
to do it. I love playing basketball
and I can’t quit. Its a great way to
get to know people. I've already
made all kinds
of connec-
tions."

When he is

Brands has
been working
in the team

on the
sponsor‘s farm.
Also, he has
been teaching
the art of bas-
ketball to
Bremrehaven’s
youth. He
helped teach
gym classes at
local schools
where gym
teachers “don’t
know jack
about baskete
ball." He also
coached teams
of 14 and 17
year olds, give
ing them there
first exposure
to playing the
sport.

Although basketball has been only
slowly catching on in northern Ger-
many, it is rapidly gaining popular
ity in southern Germany and
throughout much of Europe. As he
begins to forge more friendships and
gain name recognition in the basket-
ball community, Brands says that he
will continue “visiting new places
and playing the sport I love."

On Wednesday the men's tennis
team hosted Central, the defending
Iowa Conference champions and sufv
fered a disappointing 61 loss. Ale
though the Pioneers lost last season
to Central, both coach Andy
Hamilton expected and the players
expected to fair better this year. Josh
Tepfer ‘97 captured the Pioneers'
sole victory in the match.

The nctmen will play in the Mid—
west Conference south division tour-
nament this Saturday at Knox.
Coach Hamilton says that this is the
toughest week of competition yet this
season but adds, “I think we have a
great chance this Saturday if we play
up to our potential."

The team had a full schedule last
week as they traveled to Simpson on
Tuesday, hosted Ripon on Friday,
and Lawrence on Saturday. The only
loss suffered was to the MWC favor—
ites, Ripon, 1.6. After shaking off
some early nerves, the team pulled
together to make a good showing.
Especially fine performances were
turned in by No. 6 Nate Solmose ‘00

Bclcagucrcd but still detemiined af-
ter hosting the Midwest Conference
south divtsion tourney over the week
end, the Grinnell College baseball
team hit the road for a league doublee
header at Coe. In the ﬁrst game of the
set, the Coe pitcher threw a noehitter,
shutting out the Pioneers 4-0. Pros-
pects did not look good for Grinnell
as Coe took a 5-0 lead in the second
game The Pioneers showed their re-
siliency and battled back to tie the
game at 6-6. Coe carried the day how
ever, scoring in the bottom ofthe sixth
and holding the Pioneers in the top of
the second for an 876 win. Grinnell
travels to Illionois College for a
doubleheader on Saturday to finish the
week,

In the tournament the Pioneers lost
all three games, to Monmouth, 670;
Knox, 18—5; and Illinois College, 13,
2,

It was the second meet of the week
for some Grinnellians as Central hosted
a makeup meet Tuesday and scored 21 1
points to win. A handful of trackstets
competed. Webel won the 800 in a PR

No. l, Muji Sherdil ‘97. According
to Hamilton, “Sherdi is starting to
hit his stride. playing a wonderful
match against Ripon. If he contin—
ues his strong play we’ll be in great
shape for our matches this week."

With an altered lineup, Ihe Pio—
neers were still able to trounce host
Simpson on Tuesday. The top three
singles players, Sherdil, Seth
Pourciau ‘00 and Tepfer, all turned
in convincing victories. Much to the
delight of Hamilton, the Pioneers
were also able to take two of the re-
maining three singles matches and all
of the doubles, thanks to the play of
Jaemin Kim ‘98, Frank Davis ‘98,
Collin Conoley ‘99 and Nate
Knoernschild ‘00.

The lineup changes also paid off
against a weakened Lawrence team.
Once again the top three singles play-
ers all won their matches easily.
Even with the lineup changes
Grinnell once again did not drop a
single set. Second-year player
Conoley credits the win to the fact
that “five out of their six players had
ﬁrst names starting with the letter ‘J ‘.
Everyone knows that’s bad luck."

If the Pioneers win this Saturday
against Knox, they will play in the
division championship, most likely
against Coe. With an impressive
overall record of 10—5, the Grinnell
team should be very competitive.
“Clearly," said Hamilton, “We are in
zi great position to surprise a lot of
people With our performances this
week. I think that our focus and our
determination, especially on the part
of our seniors, put us at an advan»
tage."

"The players and I feelthat we‘re
still doing the right things. We're hit-
Ling well and putting the ball in play.
Eventually this will pay off. In the three
weekend games we struck out only 11
times," Coach Tim Hollibaugh com-
mented. Against Monmouth the Pio-
neers played their third errorless game
of the season and Rob Martin ‘98
pitched five scoreless innings before the
Scots escaped, Hollibaugh pointed out.

Grinnell displayed some power hit-
ting Saturday. Though hishtlting streak
ended at nine games against
Monmouth, second baseman Mike
Munoz ‘99 came back with a home run
against Knox. First baseman Jason
Zceh ‘98 had a single and poled a long
homer and a single against Illinois Col-
lege and third baseman J.P. Chrisu'ansen
‘98 hit a pair of doubles,

“Everyone is still positive despite
adversity. We Will continue to play
hard," the coach vowed.

Sports Information

Uplifted by three recent victo-
ries, the Grinnell College softball
team is preparing for a busy week,
The Pioneers host a doubleheader .
against league rival Monmouth
Saturday at 1 o‘clock. A trip to
Coe is on tap for next Monday.

Coach Janelle Tieken was
pleased with her team’s 3 of6 per-
formance last week but also mind—
ful of phases that need improve-
ment.

We hit off the charts last week.
We had 16 hits in two of the games
and got production from everyone.
We seem to get people on, move
them around and in, one at a time,
Mental toughness is improving,
too. However, we need to clean up
our defense and give our pitchers
better support,” the coach ob-
served. Grinnell had 14 errors in
the three doubleheaders.

Last week the Pioneers dropped
a pair to Cornell, 4—1 and 10-9 in
eight innings; swept Illinois Col-
lege. 1-0 and 11-5; and split against
non-conference opponent Rock-
ford, bowing 10-2 and winning 7-
5,

- The second game against
Cornell was a heartbreaker as the
Grinnellians look a 9-8 lead in the
eighth but lost on unearned runs.
Against Illinois College rookie Jan
Maxwell ‘00 pitched a sparkling
shutout, allowing only three hits
while striking out ﬁve‘and issuing
no walks.

Grinnell’s run came on a double
by Vicky Drake ‘98 and a single by
Cary Perillo ‘97. The Pioneers‘ 16
hits in the second game included
four by Maxwell and three apiece
by Perillo and Erin Doyle.

Although Rockford hushed
Grinnell bats in the no‘neconference
opener, the Pioneers earned a vic-
tory behind Maxwell‘s steady
pitching. Credited with three vic-
tories, including one in relief, Max-
well had an ERA of .74 for the
week.

As a team the Pioneers are hit-
ting .300, a statistic that gratiﬁes
Coach Tieken. The top four hitters
are Maxwell batting,489, Perillo at
.382, Drake at ,381 and Becky
Oberly ‘99 at .3481
