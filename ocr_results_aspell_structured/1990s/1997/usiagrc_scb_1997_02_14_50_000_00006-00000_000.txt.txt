HE’S MONEY: Jeff Clement captures NCAA record

Strong team effort helps three-point specialist hit 16 treys for new record

BY BENDAN FLAHERTY
Sports Editor

Literally millions of sports fans
were shocked last weekend by the
nation’s biggest sporting news. They
were shocked that on Saturday in a
small Iowa town a point‘guard play»
ing for a relatively obscure Iowa col,
lege broke the NCAA record for
three pointers, “What got into this
guy?" they asked themselves. Ev-

eryone wants to know how sopho-
more JeffClement knocked down 16
three pointers for 48 points and, even
on campus, speculation is rampant:
was it skill, luck, the Force or maybe
his traditional breakfast of Product
19 ﬁnally paid off.

Accordtng to Clement and his
teammates, however, it was nothing
but the natural result of playing hard,
playing together and playing on their
home court, “1 just went out and
played. The team came together and

we played a great game. My team»
mates were setting great picks and
hitting me while I was open," Clem-
entsaid. ”After my ﬁrst two-pointer,
[just thought

second half the coach pulled me
aside and said you’ve got a shot at
the record and from then on [just
went for it." After he got the record

and the Pit)-

 

thls is going to
be a good
night." Later
in the first
half, he hit
three three-
potnters in
rapid succes-
sion, lgniting
the rest of the
team and
sending the
crowd into 21
frenzy.
Clement
said he knew

 

New record holder Jeﬂ Clement

neers recorded
their sixth win.
C l e m e rt t
savoured the
moment, “My
te am ma t es
were all
around con-
gratulating me
and the crowd
was going off.
It was amaze
ing.”

The na-
tional press
has embraced

 

 

the record was
within reach before the end of the
game, ”About half way through the

Clement’sex-
traordinary performance. Featured
on many ESPN Sports Center edi-

tions, at halftime of other college
games, on CNN and in USA Today,
the story of the Pioneers’ sophomore
point guard is being nationally rec~
ognized. Clement is not taking the
exposure too seri-
ously, but having
grown up watch-
ing his basketball
idols on Sports
Center, he feels
that seeing himself
there is “a dream
come true. Watchingthose clips was
just awesome."

Despite the event‘s hype and cite
citen-lent, both Clement and the learn
are staying focused on the conference
championship. The Pioneers
chances are strong, according to se-
nior co»captain Kevin Rennert, if the
team can duplicate their performance
against Monmouth where they “got
back to the ideas of maximum pare

ticipation and letting it ﬂy."

The ramiﬁcations of the record
setting performance on the team and
on Clement are not yet clear. but the
game could drive the Pioneers to a
successful finish
and cenainly will
provide everyone
involved with an
uplifting memory.
c l a y t o n
Kaneshiro, the
Pioneers other co»
captain, felt that the game was an
“exciting and great thing to be a part
of" and that the team can use the ex-
perience to finish successfully.

After playing one of the most
memorable games of his life, Clem»
ent said simply that “every guy out
there is capable of setting records,"
but that “the team is really focused

' on winning the conference chamin

onship."

best game of season

Sports information

Coming off one of their best ef-
forts ofthe season, the Grinnell Col»
lege women's basketball team has
two important Midwest Conference
outings this week. Saturday the Pio»
neers play at Knox, then next Tues»

Darby Gym.

Knox enters in second place of
the league’s south division with a7-
4 record. Cornell is 1711 in fifth
place while the Pioneers are sixth at

0-11. Knox downed Grinnell, 42721,
and Cornell prevailed, 55-44, earlier
this season.

Our goal the second time through
the conference schedule was to play
better and close the gap against our
opponents. It should be a difﬁcult
task to narrow the margin against
Knox because they are playing well.

_ We hope to put together a solid efr

fort and make a serious run against
Cornell," commented Coach Jenny
Wood.

Arseneault. “It was an especially
tough loss because we need to win
the home games."

Cornell were a prelude of an even
stronger performance. Saturday

As their season draws to a close,
the Grinnell College men’s and
women’s swim teams continue to
exhibit the mettle they have shown
all season. In last weekend’s trian—
gular against Luther and Loras, both
squads put forth solid efforts, possi-
bly foreshadowing strong outings in
the upcoming post-season meets.

On the women‘s side Grinnell
routed Loras, 87-26. but narrowly
fell to powerhouse Luther, 60»53. It
was the third time this year that
Luther has defeated the Pioneers in
head-to-head competition. But the
Mad Ducks have consistently nipped
at the heals of Luther. the top small-
college squad in Iowa. The rivalry
with Luther has enhanced the qual-
ity of the squad which promises to
help Grinnell during the Midwest
Conference championship.

Lisa Haberl. a talented freshman,

continued to shine in the triangular.
Haberl won both the 1000 freestyle
(11:52.72) and the 100 breaststroke
(1:14.30). “That was the ﬁrst time
in three meetings that we defeated
the Luther breaststrokers." men»
tioned Coach Erin Hurley.

nior captain Morgen Cheshire won
the 100 backstroke (1 :05,27) and fins

(2:04.88). Finally, freshman Allison
Groves was second in the 100 but-
terﬂy (1:06.70) and first in the 400
individual medley (5:06.52).

The men were defeated by both
Loras (55»58) and Luther (34-76).
But the Mad Dogs were shorthanded
since certain key swimmers could
not make the trip for various reasons.
Those who did make the trek to
Loias, hoWevei’, performed Well.

Coach Hurley singled out the ef»
fort of Nathan Lueck, a freshman
who won the 50 freestyle (22.42) and
was second in the 100 freestyle
(51.10). Junior Chris Wernimont
finished third in the 100 backstroke

(4:56.18), a race he had not com-
peted in all season. Also, the diving

both events.

After the grueling meet schedule
of the past few weeks, the Pioneer
men and women are looking forward
to this weekend’s open date. Grin-
nell will use that time, to prepare for
the MWC meet. “Everybody is re-
ally looking forward to the week-
end," noted Coach Hurley. “It will
be an excellent opportunity to get

chance to get academics in line. We
need full, healthy squads if we hope
to score points at conference."
