Coming off its stunning perfor-
mance last weekend at the Midwest
Conference south division tourna-
ment, the Grinnell College men’s
tennis team will compete for the
league title this Friday in Madison.
Wis. The competitions for individual
and doubles champions will be Sat-
urday and Sunday respectively.

The netmen earned the south di-
vision crown by beating Knox, 43,
and Coe, 70. “Every match the en-
tire day was a battle, which I believe
is a tribute to the quality of the play-
ers and coaches for both of these
teams," Coach Andy Hamilton ex-
plained.

The combination of youth and
experience provpd to bethe decidr
ing factor in the Knox match as
Grinnell's winners in singles con-
sisted of two freshmen, Nate
Solmose and Seth Pourciau, and a
sophomore. Aaron Wagner. In
doubles play. the No. 1 team of se-
nior Muji Sherdil and Pourciau
emerged victorious in a hard~fought
match while the senior duo of Josh
Tepfer and Themios Carabas per-
formed solidly, as they have all year.

Qrinnell’s dominating doubles
play, balanced with some great
singles action, stiﬂed Coe in the de»
‘ciding round. Particularly notable
was the performance of Sherdil at
No. 1 singles, Against both Knox
and Coe Sherdil had grueling, three-

set matches. He played well in aloss
earlier in the day to Knox‘s Chaz
Kuper, then showed his resiliency
and conditioning by coming back
from a ﬁrstrset defeat to win 4-6, 6-
2, 6-2, against Coe.

“I was extremely pleased with the
outcome. Our goal was to make it to

Aaron Wa

the conference championship and we
achieved it," said Conch Hamilton,
“There has not been one player who
carried us all season long. We have
been an extremely balanced team
with all of our members colitribut~
mg. I am truly proud of our play-

practicing for this F riday’s league title competition in

Madison.

The Grinnell College men's
golf team faces a particularly
daunting challenge this week;
the linksmen must make up 11
strokes in the
final three
rounds of the
Midwest Con<
ference south
division play
in order to se-
cure a division
title. This will
be no simple
task, consider-
in g that the
leader, Knox,
boasts a rich
tradition as
well as some of
the top golfers
in the MWC.
But following
two solid
rounds from his squad in a non,
conference meet at Buena Vista,
Coach Greg Wallace has seen his
lower-tier players excel. 1f the
upper-tier players can post simi-
lar efforts this weekend, the Pio-
neers, who enter the final three
rounds in second place, stand a
.good chance of catching Knox.

The final three rounds will
take place at three venues over a
three—day span. The first round
will be held at Cornell on Friday

“It was
encouraging to
see the bottom
of the order do
so well Now we
just need. the
upper tier to

get on track.”
--Coach Greg Wallace

and the second round at Coe on
Saturday. The final and decisive
round is slated for Grinnell on
Sunday. The Pioneers hope to
take advantage of the scheduling.
If they can stay close to Knox on
Friday and Saturday, on Sunday
they can make a run at the leader
in familiar surroundings, their
home course Oakland Acres.

Knox’s ll-stroke lead is for-
midable, yet the Pioneer golfers
have displayed prowess of late.
Most notably. Coach Wallace’s
No. 3, No. 4, and No. 5 players
performed brilliantly at the
Buena Vista tournament. Marc
Janssen ‘97 at No, 3 shot 7677,
perhaps the team’s best indir
vidual performance of the year.
No. 4 Clayton Kaneshiro ‘97
c o m p l e -
m e n t e d
Janssen with
a 77 and 79
day. Finally,
Raj Sahu ‘00
turned in a
clutch pere
formance in
the first
round, shoot»
ing a 78.
“Janssen had
an excellent
weekend of
golf,” noted
C o ‘ a c h
Wallace. “It
was encourr
aging to see
the bottom of the order do so
well. Now wejust need the up
per tier to get on track."

Grinnell’s effort at the Buena
Vista tournament was strong
enough to earn sixth place out of
twelve teams, four of them nan
tionally rated. CoachWallace rer
marked that his top players, Dcr-
rick Fimmen ‘97 and Matt
Wagner ‘97, are capable of
shooting in the mid to low 705 at
any time.

the Grinnellians again proved in

the league. In the second game,

At Illinois College last Satur-
day, the Pioneers lost by scores

game, the Pioneers battled into an
extra inning before succumbing to
Illinois‘ clutch hitting. Jeremy
Wurmfeld ‘97 and Corsetti
pitched the first game while Marv
tin and Mike Munoz ‘99 worked
game two. Wurmfeld, Jeff Clem-
cnt ‘99 and David Gearcy ‘00
each collected two hits in the sec»
ond game.

“We hit the ball well and outhlt
LC. in both games but we'rc lcavn

the 100 (13.15), while Walters pro-
duced the best conference time this
year in the 1500. “Razel went under
19 minutes for the first time in her
career and the 4x 100 ran its_best time
this season!" exclaimed Freeman.

Following a tough training week,
the Grinnell College men’s track
team, like the women’s squad, is
looking forward to competing at Coe
this weekend in the last meet before
hosting the Midwest Conference

pleased with the Pioneer showing,
"It was a solid effort by everyone.
Drake is a very challenging meet,
with very top competition. It was a
good experience,"

The rest of the squad traveled to
Simpson on Friday night for a meet
under the lights. Freeman was quite
enthused, “We ran great. There was
a lot to be happy about. There were

Freeman commented.

Freeman had praise for all of the
400-meter hurdle competitors.
“Mark Schliekelman [‘97], Nick
Lanna, and Matt Rhodes [‘99] all ran

really well. Schliekelman probably .

would have qualiﬁed for nationals,
but he had step troubles on the ninth
hurdle. He looked good.” Lam;

sixth, ran personal bests.

The second place»ﬁnish of the 4

Schliekelman, Shannon Robinson
‘97 and Rhodes was a pleasant sur-
prise for Freeman, “ They ﬁnished
with a time of3:23. 12, and that was
without the help of one of our top
runners. I was very pleased to see
this group run so well.“

In ﬁeld events Freeman received
terriﬁc performances from Jeff Root

the pole vault comfortably at 13'11".
Cotten ﬁnished the day with a jav-
elin throw of 1524, only two feet
short of ﬁrst place. Additionally,

cus and the shot put.
