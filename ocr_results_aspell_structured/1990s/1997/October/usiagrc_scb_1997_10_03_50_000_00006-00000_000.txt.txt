country team finished 5th, beating
nationally-ranked Augustana, at the
Brissmad-Lunden Invitational in
Rock Island Illinios last Friday.
This weekend the Pioneers travel to
Beloit for the 35‘“ annual English-
siyle Invitational. Traditionally the
meet has featured more than 20
teams from the three-state area.

The team's performance at the
Brissman-Lunden Invitational rep-
resents a step toward reclaiming the
Midwest Conference cross country
title, Nineteen teams, five nation-
ally ranked, ran on the fast High-
land Springs GolfCourse, site of the
1995 NCAA Div. III champion-
ships. North Central won the meet
with 38 points. UW~Oshkosh was
next with 53 and Washington Uni-
versity placed third with 75, The
Pioneers placed fifth with 155
points and beat nationally-ranked
Augustana.

“I thought we were very competi-
tive against the nationally-ranked
teams. Frankly I didn't expect us
to run this well as the week was a
tough one. 1am really pleased with
the effort," commented Freeman.

Freshmen Rob Park and John
Aerni continue to run at the front of
a strong Grinnell pack. Park led the
way with a sixth-place finish in a
field of about 300 runners. I-Ie
edged fellow freshman John Aerni
by six seconds, 25:57 to 26:03.

Other scorers included sopho-
more Dan Madigan who placed 35‘“
(26:30), Neil Gipson (26:49) and se-
nior Andrew Jacobsen (26:56).
Kevin Notheis and Casey Miller
completed the scoring with times of
27:02 and 27:17 respectively. “I en-
joyed seeing everyone run so well,
but it was especially gratifying to
see the performances of Jacobsen.
Andy Nelsori and Andy Broadwell.
All three are working hard in prac-
tice," said Freeman

“The freshmen are setting high
standards for the others, When we
can improve our range times for our
top five runners to less than 25 sec-
onds, this group will run with any-
body," Freeman said.

Grinnell has enjoyed a history of
success at the Beloit meet, having
won several times in the late 1980’s
and early 1990‘s. Grinnell returns
to Beloit after a two-year hiatus.
“This will be a good meet for us. If
we keep improving week to week, I
believe this team will climb into the
national rankings," concluded
Coach Will Freeman.

Pioneers lose heartbreaker to
defending champs Ripon

BY SETH KLEIMAN
Sports Information

The Grinnell football team suf-
fered a heartbreaking 17-14 overtime
loss to Ripon College, the defending
Midwest Conference champions.
The Pioneers hope to rebound this
week against long-time rival Coe
College. Grinnell will face Coe Io-
morrow at l:30 on Rosenbloom
Field.

“We were so close, and yet so far,“
remarked Coach Greg Wallace on
last Saturday's loss at Ripon. “We
were right on the brink, but were
unable to capitalize on our opportu-
nities and unfortunately let a big one
Slip away."

The Pioneers knew it would be a
tough battle and were prepared to
give it their all From the start the
gridders took control oftlie game and
converted a score on their very first
possession. Quarterback Troy
Dougherty connected with David
Snider on it blistering 63-yard touch-
dOWn pass and Nate Solmose added
the point to put Grinnell on top, 70.

“After that great play, it turned
into trench warfare," commented
Wallace. “ Our defense played ex-
tremely well and although it bent, our
players were unwilling to break."

This determination was cenainly
apparent as the Pioneers allowed
Ripon only six first-half points on
42— and 31-yard field goals.

“We went into half-time feeling
pretty good about our performance,"
said Wallace. “However, we also
knew that the second half would be

tough as nails because Ripon is a tal-
ented team.”

Throughout the third, and most of
the fourth quarter, the two squads
battled intensely and held one an-
other scoreless. Then, with only two
minutes remaining in the contest,
Ripon began a drive at its own 20-
yard line and marched down the ﬁeld
to score a 13-yard pass with 1:031efl
on the clock, After a successful two-
point conversion, the Red Hawks
led, 14-7.

The Pioneers received the ball
back on the ensuing kick. With 0151
seconds left, Daugherty hooked up
with Snider again on the first play
for an impressive 66-yard touch-
down pass, Solmose confidently
added the extra point to knot the
game at 14, sending it into overtime.

In the extra period conference
rules allow for each team to attempt
to score from 25-yards out in a
matching score format.

The Red Hawks won the toss and
went first. The Pioneer “D" held
strong, causing three straight incom-
plete passes and Ripon had to settle
for a42-yard field goal to go up, 17-
1'4.

Grinnell then got its chance and
worked the ball all the way to the
one-yard line for a first and goal,
The Pioneers tried to run the ball in
on the ﬁrst two plays, but the Ripon
defense proved impenetrable. On
third and goal, Dougherty attempted
to throw for the win, but was picked
off, securing the victory for Ripon.

“It all looks like it came down to
the last play," said Wallace. “But in

Sports Information

After three weeks of play the
Grinnell College men’s soccer
team holds a 2-5 overall record and
are 2.1 in the conference, Withjust
one game on its schedule this
week, the Pioneers have a chance
to get rested and ready to compete.
They travel to Lake Forest on Sat-
iirday for 21 noon contest.

“The Midwest Conference is ex-
tremely balanced," said Coach
John Pfitsch. “Lake Forest was
picked by the coaches to win the
league and they have a 3-2 record.
Evcry game could go either way."

Coach Pfitsch's evaluation
played out last weekend when the
Pioneers traveled to Wisconsin for
two loop games. Saturday the
kickersjumped out to a quick start
against Lawrence, a team which
has beaten Lake Forest this fall,
and played a relentless pressing
style the entire game. ‘

Will Lee-Ashley gave Grinnell
the lead at the 22-minute mark on
a header off a corner kick by
Darren Bass. Before the half. Ken
Rosso tallied after it scramble in
front of the Viking goal. Bass got
another assist on a second-half cor-
ner kick again headed in by Lee-
Ashley. Rosso scored the final

goal on another scramble to make
the score Grinnell 4, Lawrence 0.

“We played very well against
Lawrence. We passed well and our
pressing defense was effective. In
order to stay in the league race we
needed to at least split in Wiscon-
sin," said Pfitsch.

On Sunday St. Norbert, who is
'3-0 in loop games, handed the Pio-
neers their first conference loss, 2-
0, The Green Knights scored their
first goal in the opening period and
notched the final tally with one
minute remaining in the contest.

“They were a big, physical team
and we seemed to be.tired," corn-
mented Pfitsch.

In a non-conference game last
week Simpson downed, Grinnell
3-2. The Bass and Lee-Ashley
corner kick combination worked
again and Rosso hit another shot
on a scramble in front of the
Storm's goal, “Simpson is a good
team. Our effort in that game're—
ally set the tone for us when we
went to Lawrence," noted Pfitsch.

“We'll try to build on the good
defensive effort which we had last
week. On offense our emphasis
will be on passing. Ultimately that
will help our scoring," concluded
Pfitsch.

 

scored her first collegiate goal
halfway through the first halfand
first-year Amy Walters knocked
one in late in the second,

“This is turning into an excit-
ing season for us because we have
a lot of new faces on this team.
With the addition of some play-
ers who just came off injuries,
we're just now getting to know
one another's tendencies,” said
Wood.

Saturday the Pioneers battled
a much-improved Lawrence
squad. With less than five minutes
to go in the first half, first-year
Sarah Dixon put one in the back
of the net for her first collegiate
goal. First-year Becki Wright
added one in the second and the
Grinnellians went on to win, 2-0.

“This game was fantastic for us
because it epitomized a total team
effort," exclaimed Wood. “Our
bench was loud and energetic and
everyone played!"

Sunday the kickers added to
their winning streak with an
amazing 2-] overtime victory
against a talented St. Norbert
squad.

Grinnell and St. Norbert have
combined to win 10 of the last 11
conference championships (five
apiece), so both teams knew that
the game would be intense.

Both teams controlled
stretches of the game, with the
first half ending in a scoreless tic.
Early in the second half Walters
broke free and slotted one home.
Late in the game the Knights pep-
pered the Grinnell goal with a
fierce attack and eventually
scored with merely two minutes
to play. This sent the match into
sudden-death overtime.

In CT the Pioneers wasted no
time as Walters weaved through
the St. Norbert defense and hit the
winner only 1:13 into the exrra
period.

“We were thrilled to go out and
get a win that we really wanted,”
said Wood. “Now it will be im-
portant to focus on continued im-
provement during this week of
training, We have finally gotten
some consistent play, and must be
in sync in order to be competitive
against two good Ieams this
weekend," she concluded.
