Smoking in the Forum

To the college community.

Having attended multiple SGA
meetings in order to speak out for my
smokingprivileges (note thatldo not
say rights) in the Forum north
lounge. I found myselfrealizing. that
spending only one more semester at
Grinnell College. I do not really care
too much about my privileges ( note
that I do not say rights). but instead
developed a great concern about the
symbolic implications of the anti-
smoking crusade led by the
pulmonarily challenged

I think smokers should enjoy the
privilege (note that I do not say right)
to smoke in a centrally located. ad'-
equately sized location offering an
academic environment. For the rea-
son of efficient usage. such a loca-
tion should be one that is also used
by nonsmokers for whatever activi-
ties. north lounge is such a place. I
am opposed to the creation ofa pure
“smoking lounge": aplace that only
smokers will use and most likely
only for smoking. SGA‘s decision
to make northanorth lounge (a term
coined at the SGA for the little room
just north of north lounge). which is
smaller than the bathroom I used to
(illegally) smoke in in junior high
school. created exactly such a place.
I see the effectiveness of
marginaliztng smokers in order to
combat smoking. but do not think
Grinnell ought to be the place to
implement such measures.

I see the nonsmoking campaign as
a campaign to eradicate smoking in
all campus buildings. Asthmatics
will one day also want to attend
events at Bob’s. which they presently
advertise as an alternative place to
smoke, and the hypersensitive ones.
who now have problems in the Fo-
rum desk area will face the same in
a nonvsmoking north lounge and
eventually also want to claim north-

slit.

north lounge. Iwould have liked to
discuss the issue of accessibility of
space to smokers and sensitive non-
smokers. but the level of militancy
as well as the lack of humor I one
countered among non-smoking ad.
vocates (I must admit that my cone
tact to them was limited to the SGA
meetings) effectively prevented me
from doing so. Not being a lawycri
have aproblem communicating with
people who bombard me wiih poli-
cies and acts and threaten “lawsuits”
and the intervention of “outside
agencies and authorities." I believe
that people. especially in arelatively
small community like Grinnell
should try to work out their differ
ences without resorting to such mea
sures.

[come from a country that was libs
erated by American soldiers. smoke
ing American cigarettes. from the
dictatorship ofa militant nonsmoker.
Iam not trying to call attempts to ban
smoking at Grinnell College
fascistoid. but merely trying to
contextualize the positive symbolic
qualities I attribute to cigarettes.
Cigarettes. in spite of all their bad
implications. are one of the great
symbols of American freedom.
American freedom differs from that
of totalitarian countries primarily
through its embrace of the freedoms
of consumption and expression.
Any fom'i of consumption constitutes
a violation of other people‘s rights.
as it takes resources away from them.
Thus the consumption of tobacco
violates the rights of sensitive non-
smokers by taking away their air, but
put in perspective to what amount of
devastation and suffering other kinds
of consumption—like those of en.
ergy, housing, transportation and
even medical care and educationi
cause in this world. the consumption
of cigarettes contributes little to the
harm done. Instead. in aworld where

be victimized by everybody else. in,

evitably becomes a perpetrator.
smoking. as a means ofself-destruc-
tion, becomes for many a moral al-
tematlve to other forms ofconsump-
tion. Smoking is also a means of
expression. and while “I don’t give a
[expletive] about my health and that
of others" might not be the most
popular statement to make at Grin-
nell. it is one that carries a valid
subtext.

In many ways i feel great compas.
mm with the asthmatic cause. espe
cially so as I myself am allergic to
many airborne chemicals, 1 suffer
from multiple chemical sensitivrty, a
disorder that can include smoke sens
sitiviiy. I experience often strong
allergic reactions to chemicals cone
tained in perfumes and other olfacr
tory beauty care prod»
ucts. While this has

smokers esthetically reinforced. and
to have a monument to the elimina-
tion of smoking as an expression of
sophistication among the upper and
middle classes.

Sincerely.

To Grinnell:

Hey, now. I smoke and I sure do en-
joy being able to have a place on cen-
tral campus to do it when it’s cold
out or raining and all. but yes. Ican
sympathize with all of you (or is it
just all four of you?) who are asth-
matic or otherwise super—sensrtive to
the lingering clouds. et cetcm. But

get what you want. I get what I want.
Given that what you want (though
perhaps we could. ifwe wanted. talk
just a little about how exaggerated

tiVlty might be) is inherent, unavoid—
able. not-your fault, while what I

never question peoples

Iwill conclude With my
proposal for an alterna

an adequately sized and equipped
mobile home on central campus. It
should be possible to get a used one
for not much more than the $9500
estimated for the adequate ventilar
tion of nortlirnorth lounge and it
should accommodate more ad
equately for all parties' smokers get
adequate room and nonsmokers a
completely smoke free Forum. Non-

which don’t always shore up too well
together. chief among them being the
Prominence of the Individual and,
my personal favorite. I Am My
Brother‘s Keeper. Throw in the mle
of the majority and faith in capital-
ism and you get: the forum smoking
issue.

Now. I figure we ought to try and
ignore all that. and try to concentrate
on this: we're a group of fairly intel-
ligent. very privileged. largely/4w
charge-of»ourselves folks sitting in
the middle of Iowa trying to learn
something. We can choose to learn
the value (or otherwise) of rhetoric,
the ability to get what we want
through legal intimidation. the abil-
ity to come in and change things
without getting much of an under-
standing of them to begin with... or,
we can choose to learn some more
valuable things, and we can take
them out of here and see what we can
do with the world instead of vice-
versa. You see my point?

The north lounge is enormous. It
can be used for much better things
than smoking. An issue was raised
which is particularly of this point in
time in our society. and it's been ans
swered reasonably. Those ofus who
smoke will willingly isolate our-
selves while doing it so as to not
bother anybody else. That’s compro-
mise, andjust because non-smoking
as a socxetal issue is still a novelty.
that doesn’t make it any less real or
important to those who believe in it.
But in the meantime (and these
things do take time. even when we’re
all speeding on through here like
there’s no tomorrow). it seems to me
like there’s no point in jumping the
gun and evicting us all from our
happy little smokeeden. Not unless
you just want to prove you can do it;
not unless you’re so struck by the
righteousness of your path that you
can’t pause and think about what you
might learn from all this. and think
about a few perspectives outside your
own. We've compromised. and we’ll
keep compromising. Who cares that
the law says you don’t have to ifyou
don‘t want to Ijust ask that you try
it.

Cheers.
