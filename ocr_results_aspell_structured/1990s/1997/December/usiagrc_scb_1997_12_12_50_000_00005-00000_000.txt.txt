He Said/ She Said: The Merits Of Waltz-Night Lechery and Disorder

BY KURT ORZECK
Arts Editor

Pressed against the frotit of the
stage underneath a flothiiig Davtd
Yow, I didn’t even notice Ali stick
her face in the crotch ofthe frenzied
lead singer. not to mention lliy hips
being ground against the mclal stage
like two pieces of llint. Head down.
body pumped full of Jesus Lizard
Juice (and whisky. too. of course). I
spent my seventh Lizard slitiiv
smacking my hands agaiitst tho stage
in sync with the rumbling bass of
David Wm Sims.

Not until we were well into the car
ride home did I notice the biuiscs
start to surface. Suddenly it bCCZlmC
uncomfortable to sit; it was bad
enough that I was still slick from left—
over sweat; but now I began to no
ticc annoyances. Hours later. when
the sun rose
(and my
drun kc n —
ness wore
off),Icould
fi n a l l y
identify the‘
source of
lny dlsr
coiil fort:
around my hands and hips and elr
bows and knees had appeared dark
blotches, swirls of blue, red. and
black,

Over the course of the next day or
so. the bruises hindered a number of
my routine activities No longcr
could I bump and grind in Harris.
wear my pants skin light, or even
throw myselfagainst the walls ofmy
room (to the sounds oflhc Iesus Lizr
aid, of course).

I was as astonished as my flicnds;
never had I received such battle scars
from a show before. not even when I
went to see G and f‘n R in the eighth

tight...

No longer could I bump
and grind in Harris,
wear my pants skin

grade (actually I never did). Tliell I
began to wonder. “hmm were the
wounds worth it?"

I lan intoAli the next day. and found
her in a similar condition. She re
vealed to me one ofher festering hip
lacerations. puss oozing ottt of it
amidst a black whirlpool of jelly
crust Apparently the wine coolers
had been too much for her the itight
before. too: “Everyonc's calling us
a hunch of sick fucks.” she said. I
shook my head. “N0 Ali," I mains
tamed, ”sick fucks we are not."

That night. I had a vision. I was in
a car, driving at light speed Then,
suddenly, CHIS/l. Pan to me in a bed
naked. my body covered with bruises
similar to the ones I received at the
show. Out of nowhere appears an
attractive

from the
dream, my
mind clear.

See the connection? What's even
better than pleasure or pain alone?
The two of them together! James
Spader knew it, Holly Hunter knew
it. and now I do. too. The yin and
the yang. babv. Not onlv did we ex-
perience the Jesus Lizard for one
night. we had the pleasure of reliv»
ing the show numerous times each
day afterwards. By simply twisting
my waist the right way. I could eas-
ily reinvtgorate my body With acute
pain. and accurately relive each der
llcious. painful moment.

“...But was that worth it?" The
words echoed in our ears for days
straight. The that they were speakr
ing of was the collective 127 square
inches of puffy, painful bruises we
acquired at the Jesus Lizard show last
Saturday night. Eschcwmg Waltz.
we embarked on a drunken journey
to the center of lead singer Davld
Yow's body. Bombardcd by frat
boys’ testosterone-ridden fists from
behind alld Yow's shllkickcrs from
the front (not to mention each other
from the side). our Waltz night to
sultcd in some of the largest injuries
either of us had ever received. Un-
der the inﬂuence of Jack Daniels,
Foster's. Yow’s own Maker’s Mark
and. at Kurt’s urging. Tropical
Mango wine cooler, we proudly dis.
played ourlacerations to ourfrlends.
But then they started to hurt, A lot.
They wanna know: “But was that
worth it?"

Love hurts. But DaVld Yow hurt
LOTS. Hurt enough to make me yelp
when I sat down for class. Hurt
enough to keep me in sweatpants in
public. which I swore as a child I
would nevcrdo. Hurtenough‘forme
to take lots ofcold showers and sleep
for 17 hours straight Hurt enough
for me to whisper.
“painpainpainpain” as I mopped the
floor at work the next day.

And then the bragging began. In
the Post Office. In the Forum. Even
in the hallway before class. I was
glad to wear sweatpants anyway. as
the elastic enabled me to show off
my swollen purple joints and hip-
bones without taking my clothes off.
I thought they would think I was
tough. I though they would look at
me’ in awe and say, ”You’re rightl
That one on your left clavicle IS the

shape of David Yow’s boot! Cool!"
Instead. I was forced to skulk away
in shame as the responses came back:

“...(pausc)..All. everything they said
is true. You and your friends are a
crew of drunken sick fucks." No, I
thought to myself. No way. was it
worth it.

But now that my bruises have
turned into lovely decorator shades
ofpurple and green and the memory
of David Yow's sick»drunken face
pressed against my ear are firmly
etched in my mind. I am beginning
to feel differently. David would be
proud of my social rejection. David
would approve ofmy decision to skip
Waltz for the sake of excruciating
pain and tinnitus. David would think
I was the greatest example of rock-
andvroll sacrifice to walk the Grinnell
campus last week. And David makes
a lot of money. In other words. David
would be right.

What do Icare ifthe rest ofthe cam-
pus thinks Kurt and Ihave fallen prey
to the evils of loud music? They
don’t understand: Iwas in the FIRST
ROW. DO YOU UNDERSTAND
ME? I don’t give a flying masoch.
ist»sick»fuck if everybody else was
hung over after a night ofdancing in
the Harris Center. What I‘m trying
to say is that if you’re gonna feel the
pain. you should at leastget to take a
few jabs at a beerrdrunkcn frat boy
or two. Of course my bruises were
worth it. But was your post-waltz
walk of shame anything to be proud
of? Ithink not. Did you touch David
Yow last Saturday night'.7 If not. you
missed out. mister. You. my friend.
are a masochist without a cause.
David. Kurt and I disapprove. Take
notes and see you the day afterDlsco.

Dear Editor.

l-Icllo. Douglas Emmcll here and I
am writing because I feel that I have
been unjustly treated by the Grinnell
French Department. Each year the
French Department selects a gradur
ating senior to serve as an English
language assistant in El French high
school. I first heard about this posi-
tion as a sophomore and have. ever
since. been anticipating the .time
when I would apply, On October
29th. I received. through campus
mail. this year’s annual letter an-
nouncing the position. On October
30th. I spoke with the director of
the sclectlon committcc. expressing
my enthusiasm and asking questions.
On November 25th. one day before
the deadline. I submitted my resume
and letter of application only to be
told that thc dcadllne had been
changed to the previous Friday. I
asked why I hiidn'l been informed
and was told that “there was all e-
mail sent out,” I never lccetved this
Brlnall. When I spoke with the sec—
retary who sent the message. I was
told that every French major had re—
ceived the e-illall. I asked her ifshe
could prove that my vax account re-
ccived this email. She could not.
Nonetheless. I was told that my case
needed to he pill before the COInl’Illlr
tee. There. any and all conSidcratlon
of my application was rejected by a
“unanimous decision." The followe
mg day I requested an appointment
with the director of the committee.
A week later. I have ycl to receive
any reply.

I say. how can the French Departr
niciiljustif’y their decision? ldon‘i
believe that they can. Their utter

. lack of consistency was both llllpl’Or
fcssional and extremely misleading
atid I feel that their dccisron to to
ject my application was wrong.
They were aware that. in addition to
my standing as n senior French inn.

tion in secondary education. They
also knew ofmy cxircnie interest In
the position. The original notice has
been tacked to thy wall since the tiny
Irccclved it. Had I had any knowl-
edge ofthe change iii the deadline. I
certainly would have turned in my
resume by the new deadline. I sm-
ccrely feel that I have the right to be

cansldered for this position and I ask
the French department to reconsider
their decision

Still breathing.

Dear Editor:

We are responding to a letter to the
editor written by Stephanie de Vries
in the December 5th issue of the S&E
concerning our statements in the are
licle written by Lauren Wolfe about
Grinncll Women in Science and New
Science Project. Ms. dc Vries 6x7
picsscd concerns about inaccurate
portrayals of the science departments
at Grinncll. First. we would like to
address her criticisms of the use of
thc term “hard science." We recog-
him that this term has negative cone
notations. However. this is a come
iiion teim used to describe chemise
try. cotnputcr SClcncc, physics. and
mathematics Moreover. the tertn
physical sciences. which Ms, deVries
used. excludes both the computer
science and math divisions. We agree
that there should be another term to
describe these disciplines.

IlMolly) did say that there was not
a need for ti group to encourage
women‘in the humanities and social
sciences. As a double major in math
and sociology. I recognize that. sper
cifically. thcrc is a lack of men in
sociology. For insiaiicc. in my inns.
culinltlcs Seminar we have two men
aiitl twelve women. I would love to
see more men in my sociology
classes and feel that their perspece
lives could add flinch to Ourclass dis
cussions. I would support any cfforl.
including a men in soctal sciences
group, made to get more men the

volved in these areas. However.
GWIS’s place is not to encourage
men in social sciences, its place is to
encourage women in the sciences.

I (Melissa) admit that I should have
included in my statement to the au-
thor that although physics and com-
puter science have no women teach-
ing. the other divisions do include
women on their teaching staffs. My
negligence to recognize these
women was not purposefully orches—
trated to downplay their significance
in their fields. On the contrary, I be~
lieve that these women are pioneers
and wonderful role models for both
male and female students alike. The
fact that these women are still con-
sidered pioneers is an indication that
there is much progress to be made
before equality is reached in the ser-
enccs. I would like to apologize to
any female faculty who felt betrayed
by my omission ofthcir presence and
efforts.

We recognize that the science de-
partments have made efforts to in»
clude and encourage women and
minorities ill the sciences. and we
applaud these efforts. We also rec-
ognize that not all women have nega
tive experiences in their seience
classes. We personally would not be
science majors if we had not been
encouraged by professors in these
divisions. We are glad that Ms. de
Vries had a good experience in the
sciences. but there have been other
experiences that our fellow students
and we have gone through that have
given us cause for concern. We have
heard many stories froln women who
were blatantly and/or indirectly dis-
couraged from continuing in the sci-
ences

We recognize the danger of creat-
ing a double-edged sword: we do
not wish to paint the science divn
slolis as “evil," as Ms. chries says.
but rather to acknowledge some of
the problems that have gone
uncommunicated. We are striving to
create an environment where every
woman at Grinnell feels empowered
to pursue whatever academic ens
deavor she wishes. We are not say
ing that women who do not choose
to pursue a career in the sciences are
not “strong" or “independent"
enough. Far from that. we Wish to
point out that the lack of women in
many of the divisions of science is
NOT due to women’s lack of abill»
tics, intelligence. or independence.

but rather due to structural barriers
that these women face at Grinnell
and might have faced in their earlier
education.

We believe that open discussion of
these topics is beneficial. We would
be happy to discuss these issues fur
ther with anyone who is interested.
Anyone who wishes to speak with
either of us should feel free to cone
tact us via e-mail, campus mail or in

person.

To the editor.
It is amazing that we have the abil-
ity at Grinnell to address all kinds of

issues. including ones that other cole-

leges and universities consider too
outrageous or radical. We are sup-
portive of gays and lesbians. for
whom we have devoted a week of
tolerance which ended with a Corn-
ing-Out celebration. We are con-
cerned with diversity, which all ofthe
candidates competing for a place on
the presidential search committee
agreed was a big issue. We fight for
reducing pollution, achieving demon
cratic representation. racial and gene
der equality. and smaller issues. such
as co-ops as an alternative to pleas
ant meals we eat in the dinning halls.
It seems as if there is an effective
organization. club. SGA activity. or
group for everything and everyone.
But I say it seems for a reason. While
Grinnell is busy confronting the
plagues of our society. we have ne-
glected to recognize an importantel-
ementary problem that is prevalent
on our campus: eating disorders.

I do realize that we have a support
group for those \vltll bad body im-
ages and another for those with eat-
ing disorders. but they fail to help
many of us with an eating disorder.
These support groups require that a
student recognize a disorder in once
selfand take action to solve it. A sig
nificant number of its are unable or
don't want to admit that we have an
eating disorder. The most recentToi-
let Times. which attempts to address
body image problems and eating dis-
orders. is only a start on combating
this mental disease.

There are so many Grinncll students
who hate their bodies. Many of us

have ways to hide it. like claiming
that joining the vegans would be
healthier. when all we are really
thinking about is how much we will
reduce our fat intake by cutting out
all animal-made products in our di-
ets. Others walk into the dining halls
analyzing how many calories are in
each food item. eventually skipping
the hotline for the salad bar. which
can‘t possibly supply us with all the
nutrients we need to be healthy. If
you aren’t participating in this sick
ritual. the thought has crossed your
mind.

Even Grinnell’s male population
has problems involving eating dis
orders. When attractive football playv
ers go on diets and good looking fe-
male swimmers refusc to eat regular
meals there is obvrously a problem
that needs attention.

No one wants to bclieve that
Grinnell has people with eating dis
orders. but we niust.. Eating disor
ders are very serious. Iknow: I have
had a first hand experience At first
when you begin to lose weight.
people compliment you. telling you
how great you look. It makes you
feel good. but it also perpetuates the
problem. You continue to watch what
you eat. Eventually you lose so much
weight that you look terrible. Your
eyes disappear into your head. leav-
ing black circles in their place. You
feel tired and weak and you ale so
thin that people are afraid to touch
you because they don’t want to break
you.

This not only screws up the way
your body functions. but makes you
physically ill, It also hurts your loved
ones and your friends because they
can't stand to see you lose so much
weight that you become sick. And,
in the and. eating disorders follow
you around for the lest of your life.
No one is ever cured. I still look in
the mirror sometimes and I want to
change my body. but I know I can’t.
Ijust take it one day at a time.

Take a break from the radical battle
field and figure out a way to help
those of us with eating disorders.

Sillccrcly.
