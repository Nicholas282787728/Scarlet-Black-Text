Sports Information

When first-year coach Torn
Sonnichsen took over the
women’s volleyball program at
Grinnel] College, he had no idea
what to expect. The coach made
a great first impression as he led
the spikers to an impressive 187
12 overall record and fifth place
in the Midwest Conference.

With 18 Wins the Pioneers set
a school record for victories in a
season. The ﬁfth-place ﬁnish also
equals Grinnell's best finish in

league play.

‘ “Our team was at a disadvan»
tage all season because I had no
knowledge of our opponents. We
relied on execution and adjust»
ments in the match. That makes
what we accomplished even more
special," said Coach Sonnichsen.

Last weekend the spikers com-
pleted their season at the confer-
ence championship tournament.
In the first round Grinnel] downed
Lawrence in four games. North
division champion St. Norbert,
defeated the Pioneers in three
close games in the second round.
15710,15r13.15-12.

“Our play was very steady
against Lawrence. We were un-
emotional and went about our
business. I think we could have
done better if we knew more
about St. Norbert. It took us.a
while to figure out their style. We
were down early in all the games
and didn't pass well," commented
Sonnichsen.

Playing out of the consolation
bracket, the Pioneers defeated
Monmouth convincingly, 1574,
15-6, 15—5. This gratified
Sonnichsen and his squad, be—
cause they had split matches with
Monmouth earlier in the season.
“We could do no wrong," noted
Sonnichsen. “Our efficiency and
passing were solid and we played
above the net all match."

In the consolation finals Grin—
nell downed Beloit, 15710, 15-11,
15-5, to place fifth. The Bucs,
1995 conference champions, pre-
sented a stiff challenge because of
their size and serving ability. “We
saw leftrhanded hitters in both the
Beloit and St. Norbert matches.
Against Beloit we made smart
changes to stop the hitter. We also
handled Beloit’s service well and
made great adjustments," exr
claimed Sonnichsen.

Middle hitters Susie
Pryzbylinski, Sacha Steenhoek
and Kim Goergen won praise
from the coach for their middle
blocking, Setter Amber Donahue
ran the offense extremely well.
according to Sonnichsen, and dc-
fensive specialist Melissa
Kempenaar was solid on serve ree
turns.

“It was great to end with a
win," noted Sonnichscn. “I think
we realized we were as good as
any team in the tournament. We
have the whole team back, so with
some continued improvement and
development in key areas we may
make a run at the championship
next fall.“
