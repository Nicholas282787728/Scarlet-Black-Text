champion Coc at 12:00 and 4:00 rcr

swept by both teams, 0‘7, but Coach
Andy Hamilton is conﬁdent in his
1997 Pioneers. “I think that we‘re
much better as ti team.” said
Hamilton. “We‘re going to use oiir
showing at Coe as a benchmark for
the rest of the season,”

Coachl-lamillon‘sconfidencc was
bolstered last weekeild as-he watched
his squad drop only two sets in
matches against Cornell and Loras,
opening the season with two 770
wins. ”I'm not surprised at' all," said

Hamilton, “With two very talented
freshmen starting and three seniors

Mad Ducks set records While

Mad Dogs get revenge

Swimmers surprise critics at conference meet

BY ERIC RIENSCHE
Sports Information

Entering the Midwest Conference
championship meet, the Grinnell
College men's and women's swim
teams were saddled with gloomy pier
dictions. It seemed that everyone,
especially MWC coaches and the
media, was convinced that the Pioe
neers would finish no better than
third on the women’s side and, at
best, fourth for the men. The only
people who were not persuaded were
the Pioneers themselves. Both
Grinnell squads, flourishing in their
underdog roles, saved their best ef-
forts for the last meet of the year. The
men‘s team finished third and the
women were conference runner»up.
Powerhouse Lake Forest, as ex»
pectcd, reigned as the champions for
both men and women. But Grinnell's
efforts, marked by individual records
and lifetime hcsts, was perhaps the

story of the meet.

The Pioneer women relied on
some extraordinary individual efforts
to capture the runnerrup award. Es-
pecially impressive were the senior
captains—iMelanie Wyder, Morgen
Cheshire and Natasha Vaseyiwho
pieced together some clutch perfor-
mances, posting lifetime best times
in many events. “lt'was agreat meet
for our seniors," mentioned Coach
Erin Hurley. “There is no sweeter
feeling than knowing that you fin-
ished out your career with a lifetime
best."

The strong senior leadership was
apparent in the relay events where
Cheshire shined. “Morgen had the
fastest splits in the relays," noted
Hurley. “She really helped our team
in those events." Cheshire teamed
up with freshman Sarah Davis, freshr
man Christine Ritland, and Vasey to
set a school record in the 200 free
relay (1:445). The 400 medley rer

finishes

In the final week oftheseason the
Grinnell College women‘s basketball
team was able to assemble all the
pieces required for a,victory. The
Pioneers split their games, defeating
Cornell, 62755, and falling to Coc,

“ T h e s e
two games ,
were imporr
tant to us be-
cause they
presented the
lasl time
we’d play
Coe and
Cornell in
the Midwest
Conference,"
noted Coach
Jenny Wood,
“We were tllrilled to win the Cornell
game. There was a lot ofjoy in the
locker room." '

Against the Rams, billancc played
a key role. For the first time in the
season three players liit double fig-
ures and anorhcr player grabbed
double ﬁgures in rebounds. "We not
only had our starters playing well,
but we had some people coming off
the bench to make great contribu-
tions," said Wood

Coach Wood gave point guard
Kristen Melby credit for getting the
team on track early. “Kristen hit
some early shots which helped us to
a lead. Then she focused on distribr
uting the ball," said Wood. Melby
netted 14 points and dished out five
aSSlSlS.

Rookie Mandi Hill led all scorers
with 15 points on six ofeight shoots
ing. She also grabbed six rebounds.
Sally Goodspeed scored 12 points
and added five rebounds and five
assists. Two other rookie forwards
were solid on the boards. Sacha

Steenhoek had it team-high 10 re-
bounds while Meghan Pheister

grabbed five rebounds which gave
the Pioneers a decisive 46735 victory.

“Our victory over Cornell was a
culmination of three weeks of focus
and preparation. We thought we had
achanceso
we worked
hard to pre'»
pare forthe
opportu-
nity,"comr
in e n t e d

Wood.

In a 72-
32 loss to
Coe
S aturday
_ the Pier
neers got off to a slow start and
trailed at halftime, 36.16. “We can-
not afford to he so slow out of the
gate,” commented Coach Wood.
“Coe plnycd prctty well, especially
their seniors, but we didn't execute
wcll early in the game."

The only Grinnell double figures
came from Sally Goodspecd, who hit
15 points, l-lill added eight points
while Popson led the rebounding
with eight.

The Pioneers completed the sea-
son with an 1-21 overall record.
They were 1-13 in the league, which
was good for a fifth-place tie with
Cornell.

“There were a lot of positive traits
our team showed this season," com»
merited Coach Wood. “Nobody quit,
which isatributeto ourplayers’ char-
acter. The team also showed a great
deal of resilience by working so hard
to get our Slnglc win despite having
nZO-gnmc losing streak. [give them
a lot of credit for working so hard to
improve."

lay team of Christina Ward, Lisa
Haberl, Allison Groves and Cheshire
also shattered a school record
(4: 16.81). Finally, the three captains
teamed together with Davis in the
800 freestyle relay to swim the sec-
ond-fastest race in Grinnell history
(8:28.32).

Ofcourse, relay points only go so
far in a conference meet. Ultimately.
some individual performers need to
make contributions. The Mad Ducks
had no shortage of those contribu-
tions. In 1M diving, Jo Schaalman
finished second overall with Lizz
Welch taking 5th. Schaalman also
set a school record in 3M diving,
only one point shy of qualifying for
nationals. “Those diving points have
been really crucial to our success all
season,“ said Coach Hurley. Fresh-
man Lisa Haberl also had an excelr
lent meet, finishing 7th in the mile
(19:32.48) and fourth in both the 100
breaststroke(l:l3,3l3)and200hreast
(2:4034), Allison Groves was fourth
in the 200 IM and ﬁfth in the 100
butterﬂy.

While the women were rewriting
the record books, the men were set-
tling a score. Conference rival Coe
had beaten the Mad Dogs three times
during the season and the Pioneers
were anxious to square accounts at
the conference meet. The Kohawks

started out well ahead of Grinnell on
the ﬁrst day. But by the end of the
second day of competition the Pio-
neers had closed the gap. By the end
of the final day, Grinnell had pulled
away from the pack, finishing well
ahead of Coe and only 28 points
away from second-place Lawrence.

“1 was really proud of our men,"
noted Coach Hurley. “They were
really swimming for pride. They are
very aware of the rivalry between

Grinnell and Coe, Ithinktheresuits '

of the meet prove that.”

Headlining the effort was senior
Derek Fimmen who easily won both
the 1M and 3M diving events.
Fimmen was Grinnell's only confer
ence champion of the meet. In the
swimming events, freshman Nathan
Lueck asserted himself with some
impressive times. He was fourth in
both the 100 freestyle (48.70) and
200 freestyle (1:50.30) as well as
second in the 50 free (21.88). Ser
nior Brett Hendel was sixth in both
the 500 freestyle and the mile. Other
contributors included Brian
McElroy, Aaron Severn, Jay
Corrigan and Jeremy Lundquist.

While the individual performers
were obvtously the keys to victory,
Coach Hurley also noted the imporr
tance of other swimmers who
scraped together points in the pre-

liminary rounds. “Those little points

in the early races were crucial to our
high team standings," she said. “Ev-
erybody had a good meet. I was
proud orcvcryone on the men's and
women’s team. We have a great
group of swimmers that the school
and alumni and everyone else can be
very proud of, Ithink we can build
on what we have accomplished this

Grinnell College men‘s basketball
team has qualified for Midwest Con-
ference championship tournament.

sity in Appleton, WI this Friday at

tures Knox and Ripon at 6:00. The
winners meet Saturday at 7:00

As the defending league chamr
pion Grinnell put together an impres-
sive laterseason run to ﬁnish second-
in the south division. The Pioneers,
finishing with an 86 record, won
three out of their last four loop games
to claim the ﬁnal playoff position.
Divisron rival Knox ﬁnished at 9.5,
loosing to the Pioneers in Grinell but
Wmnlng on their own home floor.

Earlier this season the Pioneers
faced both Ripon and Lawrence.
Ripon capitalized on Grinnell’s
frigid shooting and posted a decisive
victory. Lawrence squeaked past the
Pioneers in Grinnell, 95-94. “Every
team that has a good point and post
combination presents matchup
troubles for us. In order for us to be
successful. we'll need four players
shooting well and we have to limit
their point guard in transnion,” coni-
mcnted Coach David Arseneault.

Last Wednesday the Pioneers
traveled to Cornell with a one-game
lead in the race for second place. By
virtue of a 95-94 victory and a 78-
62 witi by Coe over Monmouth, the

Clement threeepoinfer, and clutch
free throws from Matthew Croco and
Kevin Renncrt. Additionally, Rich-
ard Werner and Clayton Kaneshiro
each caused key Comell turnovers in
the waning moments

It was a great win for us," said
Arseneault. “We had a lot of differ-
entplayers step up and make plays."

Clement led the offensive charge
with 25 points and five assists.
Kaneshiro and Jason Schubert each
netted 15 points and Croco added
nine, including two llIYCCrpOlnterS.

point line for 25 points. Schubert
connected oti five of nine three-point
attempts, finishing with 22 points
Kaneshiro and Decker reached
double figures with 11 and 10 points
respectively.

“1 was disappotnted in our perfor-
mance zit Monmouth because ll
seemed like we weren't playing for
anything. In reality we could have
won the dmsmn," evaluated Coach
Arscneault.

“This team deserves to be in the
playoffs. We have to be constantly
aggressive for us to have success.
Our best players need to dig in and
give us a great effort," concluded
Arscncault.

 

Track team ready

for conference

Men’s and Women’s team
show strongly at split meets

BY SARAH BURKE
Sports Information

The Grinnell College men's track
team travels to Knox College this
weekend to compete in the Midwest
Conference championships. Having
run well the past two weekends, vete
eran coach Will Freeman anticipates
a strong Pioneer showing, “Every-
one is up and excited about confer-
ence. We’re in a good place right
now."

Freeman has good reason to be
optimistic. The team, which was
split last weekend with one squad at
Knox and another unit at Cornell,
showed extremely well. At the State
Collegiate championships held at
Cornell, the team ﬁnished fourth out
often teams, Aprerequisite for com-
petition in the meet was a top 12 {in-
ish in an event. Roughly half the
team qualiﬁed for competition. “We
ran really, really well at Cornell,”
said an ecstatic Freeman, “A fourth-
place ﬁnish with only a partial rep-
resentation gives us a lot of conﬁ
dence goinginto '
conference. I
was really
happy to see us
run so well."

Strong indi-
vidual perforr
mances came
from Ellis
Baggs who ﬁnr
ished third in the
800rmeter with
a time of 1:59.
“This lS the first
time he has run
this race under two minutes indoors.
He is now ranked at the very top of
the conference." Freeman com—
mented. Andy Nassif and Andy
Jacobsen also ran well, finishing
fourth and seventh in the 1,000
meter run.

. Freeman praised the performance
of Neil Gipson and Dan Madigan,
who finished third and fifth in the
ISOO-metcr run, as well as the fourth
and ﬁfth-place finishes of Shannon
Robinson and Nick Larma in the
400-meter dash.

Frccman was also pleased With
the firstrplacc ﬁnish of the 4x80!)
meter relay team The relay, run by
Neil Gipson, Josh Ward, Baggs and
Brian Rebﬂr, marked only the see
ond time that the team has run a dis-
tance relay this year, In each ll’lr
stance, Grinnell has come away with
a first place finish.

The biggest highlights were
Rebar’s ﬁrst place finish and Matt
Rhoades’ second-place finish in the
600. “That was 2i big event for us.
Their performances capped off what
proved to be an extremely good meet
for us. If these kind of times carry
over, we will show very well at con
ference," Freeman stated.

The Pionccr squad had success at
Knox ns well. Freeman was particu-
larly happy with the performances of
the vaulters and the Sllotrputters,
"The vaulters looked good. I'm feel»
ing really good about them, The shot

times carry over,
we will ShOW very

-»Coach Will Freeman

putters are also coming along nicely. .
Brian Princer has shown improve,
ment. If we put these performances
together with what we accomplished .
at the state meet, we will really give
Coe, Monmouth, and Carroll some
competition at conference."

Freeman feels that the team is .
well-positioned going into the league .
meet. “This is a good team. I feel
really good about this group and how
the training is going. While we don‘t .
have the depth that Coe has, we have
some really fine talent up front.
After such strong performances the
past two weekends, Ithink they have
a new conﬁdence in themselves. All
that is left is for us to put it all to-
gether." ‘

_ The Midwest Conference indoor
track championship meet will be
held this weekend at Knox. Defend-
ing champion Monmouth is ex-
pected to win, but Coe. Carroll and
Grinnell will challenge for the title.
“Despite the short period of training.
everything is falling in place." said
Coach Evelyn
Freeman. Last
year Carroll
took second,
edging out the
Pioneers by two
points.

The strength
of the team con-
sists of the
middle and
long-distance
runners. “Holly
Kilmer, Julie
Serafini, Becca
Webel, Stephanie Walters, Marta
Fisher and Razel Mueller all have
improved weekly and should be
ready to peak. Amanda Walker and
Sara Boudouris should fare well in
the sprints and the 4x400 and 4x200
relay-teams should be competitive,"
cemented Freeman. Meredith lng
is ranked No. 2 in the highjump, but
the obvious holes are the absence of
hurdlers and ﬁeldrevent personnel.

Last week at the state meet
Grinnell placed Sixth with 41 points.
Loras won the meet with 218 points,
and Simpson edged St. Ambrose 77-
65. Some members ofthe Grinnell
team, including distance runner Fran
Lee, ran at Knox last week.

In the state meet at Cornell,
Kilmer finished third in the 1500.
Walters and Webel were close be-
hind, placing fourth and fifth respec-
tively. Additionally, Mueller placed
second and Fisher placed third in the
5000. “The middle and long-dis»
tance runners have deﬁnitely turned
out to be the backbone of our team,"
said Freeman.

The relay team of Webel, Walters,
Serafini and Kilmer won the 4x800
in 10:12 while Boudouris captured
fourth in the 400 in a seasonrbest
time of 63.27. Meredith Ing was
sixth in the highjump with a leap of
4'10". “We do not have much depth,
but we have quality runners who
should do well at the conference
meet," concluded Freeman,"
