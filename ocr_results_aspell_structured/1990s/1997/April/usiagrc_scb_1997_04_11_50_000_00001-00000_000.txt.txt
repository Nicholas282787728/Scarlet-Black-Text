‘Grinnell As A Neutral Venue’ event a success
Discussion among international students promotes understanding

BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Staff Writer

Growing up a Muslim in Pakistan,
Taimur Rahman ‘98 was told “that Hindus
would take unborn babies and rip them cm
of their mother's wombs, that they would
take small children and throw them onto a
spear.” He heard tales of savage crimes
committed by Indians, and was taught that
Ghandi was an evil man, Two years into
his Grinnell College experience, he found
himself living with Rajat Dawar ‘98, an
Indian, and liking it, Stories such as these
were central to Thursday’s “Grinnell as a
Neutral Venue" presentation, one of sev-
eral International Week ‘97 events.

“Coming to Grinnell, I thought, wow.
what a place,” said Dawar, who had grown
up hearing many of the same stories ap-
plied to Pakistanis that Rahman had heard
about Indians. Dawar, President of die In-
temational Student Organization, found that
away from the nationalistic pressures of
India, he was allowed “to relate [to
Rahman] on a one to one basis where we
could talk about our mutual backgrounds.”

Maria Pyshkina ‘98. from Russia, and
Alexander Jibladze ‘00. from the Republic
of Georgia, differed from the other groups
in that they dealt with historical inconsis-
tencies regarding Russia's occupation of
Georgia, rather than ethnic bias. “Russia
took advantage of [its alliance] and con»
quered Georgia,“ said Jibladze. Pyshkina.
on the other hand, had been taught that
Russia had acted within its rights in its treat-
ment of the republic. “It sounded like a
new story, not because I didn‘t study his-
tory," she said, “but because I did study
history, but I studied history in Russia." .

Although the discussions remained
calm, some students did not see eye to eye.
When Patrick Chow ‘98 from China stated
that ”Tibetan people have their own beliefs
and their own religion," Tibetan Sonam
Lama Sherpa ‘98 was quick to add “and
their own country." Chow’s response was
“No, their own geographic region,”

Both Lama Sherpa and Chow said they
experienced growth in personal understand-
ing, however. “I was told as achild that the
Chinese communists ate children," Lama
Sherpa said. “It was hard to swallow my

pride when [I learned otherwrsej."

Following their presentations, the students
welcomed discussion with the audience. "Ihis
campus is constantly movtngintwo directions,
one creating problems and another solving
them," said Patrick Saunders ‘00, who was
impressed by the uruty that students from dif-
ferent backgrounds were able to achieve. Pro
fessorJohn Mohen of the Russian Department
summariwdthediﬂiculty with ethnic conﬂicts
by paraphrasing the late ProfessorEd Steiner:
"Lf you forget history, you're doomed ID re»
peat it but also if you remember history then
you’re doomed to repeat it."

“Grinnell as a Neutral Venue" was one
of several International Week events. It
aimed to include students’ ”non-confron-
tational and nonrprovoking questions"
about populations with a history of conﬂict,
J ibladze said. ”This is the second year in a
row that International Week has been put
into action," said Suraj Dhungana ‘99, the
coordinator of the lntemational Week Plan-
ning Board.

Earlier events this week included mov-
ies from around the word, part of a series
that continues until Sunday, and an inter-

national fun fair. The fair, which drew more
than 100 attendants, was an “opportunity
for us to let others know about our clothes,
our books, and our cultures," said
Dhungana. He blamed low event turnout
on the heavily scheduled week, in which
many conﬂicts arose. “For the following
year, I would like to plan ahead so that it
doesn‘t clash with so many other activi-
ties,“ he said.

Intemational Week activities, sponsored
by the Office of lnten'lational Student Ser-
vices and the International Speakers Pro-
gram, will end April 13. The movie series
will continue nightly until Sunday, and two
additional events are planned.

Chaskinakay will present a concert of
Andes music tonight at 7 p.m. His perfor-
mance will include 25 different
instrumentsﬂ'lckets have already been sold
to Saturdays international banquet, The
60 people expected to attend will have the
opportunity to sample from at least 16
dishes.

“We have had a wonderful time doing
this, and hope that next year’s will be even
better," said Dhungana.

Dam symposium focuses on world waterways

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

According to Professor Sayed Z. E17
Sayed of Texas A & M University, a dam is
a “structure built across a watercourse. usu-
ally a river or a lake, in order to restrain"
water. The oldest known dam was in Egypt
along the Nile and was built between 2,950
BC. and 2,750 BC, Years after, the ancient
Romans began to build dams, and in fact
were the first to create reservoir dams. Now.
more than 1,000 dams are under construc-
tion worldwide. These oftentimes grandi-
ose structures have created a number of
ethical, ecological and human survival con—
cems. For the past week Grinnell College
has hosted a Dams and Development symr
posium in an effort to hackle some of these
problems, as well as to educate the campus
about dams and development.

Katherine Worster ‘97 and Ned Buns, a
University of Iowa student, kicked off the
symposium Monday with a talk on their
trip to the controversial Narmada Dam in
India. Worster said that the number of
people affected by this dam has been ap-
proximately 300,000, During their trip to
the site, Worster and Buns discussed the
dam with numerous villagers and activists.

"I am frustrated by a lot of the misleadr
ing things," Worster said. ”The government
ofﬁcials seemed defensive about things."
Burts said he felt people affected by the
dams were treated by the Indian govemr
ment as a liability and not a reality. Buns
said he was not necessarily against the darn
if the government would provide an ad
equate resettlement program for those disV
placed by the project. Ultimately, while

close to completion, the Narmada project
has been stopped because of a lack of funds
ing, he said. The Indian govemment report—
edly asked a key sponsor, the World Bank,
to withdraw its funding. World Bank ofﬁ»
cials cited that India did not Want to fully
abide by World Bank policies.

P.N. Gupta, a dam specialist for World
Bank, spoke laterin the week. Gupta stated
that he was afraid of the “anti-dam" direc7
tion of Grinnell’s symposium.

“Every third year is a drought year. Evy
ery other year there are ﬂoods which affect
almost 30 million people." Gupta said, add»
ing that building dams “is a necessity and
it should be accelerated." '

Michael M. Cemea, senior adviser for
sociology and social policy for the World'
Bank, spoke about the social impacts of
hydropower dams and development, Re—
cently, the World Bank was criticized for
being corrupt in its policies and program,
he said. In the past, the World Bank has
supported questionable and unethical
projects, Cemea said. However, he emphar
sized that the Bank has designed new strinr
gent guidelines for dam development, spar
ciflcally in regard to resettlement.

Professor El-Sayed described the posi
tives and negatives of the HighAswan Dam
in Egypt, a dam not sponsored by the World
Bank. Sayed participated in the first Henry
Luce Program sponsored symposium ﬁve
years ago on the subject of Antarctica and
is a pioneer in the manifestation of ozone
depletion research. He said that Egypt cur-
rently is growing at a rate of 2.5 percent
and will reach a population of 70 rrtillion
by 2000, of which 99% will be concentrated
in the Nile Delta and Nile Valley. Iii-Sayed

also cited a number of problems that
Egypt‘s High Aswan Dam has caused, in
cluding extensive coastal erosion, down
stream degradation, catastrophic effects on
marine ﬁsheries in the area, displacement
of people and submergence of archaeologi-
ca] sights, a decrease in water quality, and
an increase in seismicity.

Donald E. Worster spoke about the hu»
man attempt to saddle rivers and lakes in a
talk entitled, “The Conquest of Water in
Modern Times." Other speakers at the sym-
posium included Joseph Larson, a profes-
sor and director of the Environmental In-
stitute at Amherst College and is widely
known for his work “to establish a sound

science base for public policy in wetland
management and protection." In addition
Mlliam F. Fischer, an assistant professor
of anthropology and social studies at
Harvard University, talked ontheNannada
project in India. P.N. Gupta discussed “The
Necessity for Environmentally Sustainable
Large D'arn Projects for the 21st Century".
while the concluding talk was presented
by Philip Fearnside, a research professor
in the Department of Ecology at the Na-
tional Institute for Research in the Ama-
zon. The symposium was sponsored by the
Henry R. Luce Program in Nations 8: the
Global Environment and the Rosenﬁeld

Program.

Remembering China 1 935— 1945

Author recalls life as an American expatriot during WWII

BY JILL ERICKSON
News Editor

Bea Exner Liu hasn‘t lived in China
for many years, but from'her Minneapo~
lis condominium the 89-year-old writer
still keeps a close eye on the country she
at one time called home. Liu, whose
memoirs were published in 1996, will
speak in Grinnell at 8 p.m. Thursday,
April 17, in ARH 302.

Although her book, Remembering
China 193571945. A Memoir, was inn
tended as a compilation of memories, Liu
said it has been well-received on the ba
sis of its historical accuracy as well as its
biographical details. The book was nomi-
nated this year for a Minnesota Book
Award.

“I thought I was just writing my life
story, with the historical background in-
cidental," Liu said, “and it turns out that
the historical background was signiﬁcant
enough that it's running the show."

Chinese citizens who have grown up
in a postrwar China have never been al-
lowed by the communist government to

know much about that period, Liu added, ,

so her book has drawn the interest of
many younger readers.
A 1932 graduate of Carleton College,

Liu united with her husband Wallace Liu,
a college professor and also a Carleton
graduate, while living in China with her
sister and brother-in-law. The pair stayed
in China, residing first in Nanking and
later in Shanghai.

“I was living pretty much the normal
life of the wife of a Chinese college pro-
fessor, wasn‘t really thinking too much
about [my status as an eeratriotAmeri-
canj," Liu recalled. In the advent of
World War II, however, being an Ameri—
can began to weigh more on her mind.
While Japan invaded China, the U.S. con-
tinued to supply Japan wrth aviation gaso—
line and scrap iron.

“That was a very sore point with us,
all through the war," Liu said. “We would
see these bombing planes in the sky
knowing they were fueled with Ameri.
can gasoline, and that was really hard to
take."

“There were times when it was a little
hard to hold up my head," Liu said. DurA
ing the early days of the war while Liu
and her husband lived in Nanking, the
Japanese notified all embassies thatthey
planned to destroy the city later in the
week and wouldn’t be responsible for for-
eign citizens who remained,

“I said, you can tell the Japanese for
me that I have every right to be here and
they will be responsible for anything that
happens to me," Liu said. “All ofthe em-
bassies except ours responded pretty
much the same way." The American ams
bassador was the only one who fled.

“I guess it wasn't entirely his fault."
Liu noted. “We found out later that he
was under strict orders from President
Roosevelt to take any means possible to
get Americans out of China."

The combination of personal anec-
dotes and historical details in her book
does a unique job of bringing history to
life, Liu said.

“You read, for example, in a typical
history book that there was a terrible in-
flation," she said. “I spell it out day—by-
day how it was trying to deal with things
like that."

At the end ofthe war, she said, the gov»
ernment assured people in China that a
new currency would be backed by gold
and silver and would stabilize an
economy that saw turmoil in wartime.

“The way they backed it was to con—
fiscale all gold and silver in private
hands," Liu explained. “The conse-
quences for not turning it over were

prison or worse. People would run —
and I mean run —— to spend it for any-
thing that would hold its value, like a
case of toothpaste or a case of razor
blades or whatever they could ﬁnd to get
their money into a durable form."

The new currency remained stable for
a few weeks, she said, but soon began
to slip in value. Liu, who worked for the
United Nations at the time. recalled that
she was fortunate to have her paychecks
quoted in American dollars and pre-
sented in Chinese currency.

“I would request money before noon
and then receive it at the noon ex—
change," she said, “and then my husband
would get off work at about 3:00 in the
afternoon and rush to spend it so we'd
only lose about 20 percent of its worth."

People who worked until even 5 p.m.
lost much more, she added

After the war ended, Liu eventually
returned to the U.S. and has lived for
many years in Minnesota. Until recently,
she lived in a geodesic dome that she
built herself in her retirement “with the
help of a lot of people." Liu also has
studied natural foods and spent several
years as a beekeeper. She looks forward
to her Grinnell visit.
