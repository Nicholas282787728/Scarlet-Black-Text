The Lies We Live

—Ani Difranco

Grinnell Sore/ear

I’ll admir it. When i firsr came
here lwas naive. I probably srill am,
Whenlcamero tlliscollege,lhon»
esrly believed rhar I was joining a
liberal srudenr body wirh a firm
eommirmenr ro changing rhe
world. l've realized, rhough, that
while srudenrs here are “liberal,"
mosr srudenrs appear ro be more
concerned wirh comforr rhan
change. Despite Grinnells claims of
revolurion and anarchy, many sru.
denrs here grew up in comforrable,
uppercmiddle class homes. lr seems
rhar srudenrs here are generally
more concerned wirh mainraining
or achieving rhis lifesryle rhan wirh
changing rhe world.

Why have I come ro believe
this? Well, for example, a good
number of srudenrs here wanr ro
go inro law or medicine. Certainly,
rhesc are professions rhar can
change rheworld. But in acounrry
wirhour universal healrhcare rhar
funnels mosr ofirs besr and bright»
esr lawyers inro corporarc firms, be-
coming a member otrhcse profes-
sions hardly guaranrees rhar you

will acrually make a posirive differ-
ence in rhe world. There are many
careers our rhere rhar can offer a
liferime orworking ro change rhe
world for the berrer. Why would
so many srudenrs forare on law and
medicine? The common denomi—
nacor rhar rhese professions share
rhar mosr of me orhers do nor is
that rhey pay well, very well, mosr
ofrhe rime.

l’in nor saying rhar srudcms
here don’t have a sincere ideologi-
cal cammirmcnr ro solving prob-
lems rarher rhan perperuaring
mem. I’m saying that. for many stu»
denrs such a commirmenr is less

Acrually, rhis sraremenr is prob

rhan ivy scum is rhar rhe

beyond rhose high paying jobs,
rhough. smarr, well qualiﬁed

high paying jobs. indeed, a very real
possibiliry wirh some of‘rhese jobs
is rhar if a Grinnellian doesn'e do
it, no one will. We musr ask our-
selves: whar does ir say abour a so-
eiery rhar rakes irs besr and bright—

The ulrimare goal of rho for-

The problem arises when whar

within capitalism. Capitalism, at its
most fundamental level, is the
srruggle for monerary profit. When
push comes to shove, money talks
and bullshit walks. That's why the

Letters to the

 

Dear Editor,

Last week, a from page arricle in rhe seen fearured the reecnr conrroversy over rhe
Drug and Alcohol survey mar was apparenrly begun by an email I circulared. Molly
Gardner, me aurhar of she arriele, had mailed me or me lasr minure and asked for my
commenrs in response as discussions she had conducred wirh various members oftl-ic
adminisrrarion l was eager ro read rhe arnde, hoping rhar my commons were nor
misrepresenred and rhar rhe issue had been approached from me imparrnl srance rhar
we generally associare wirh respecrable ioumalism. l was gready disappoinred

First ofall, l was innrriared by rhe facr that Molly did nor mike ir clear that my
posirion was nor being ddvoatcd by the Grinnell Coalirion in Defense ofMurnia Abu-
Jamal. despire me signarure on me inirial email. in my response ro her quesrions regard.
ing rlie arricle, I made ir abundanrly clear rhar I had erred in delivering my criricism
from rhe Coalirion's accounr. The views erpreaed in rhar message are mine.

sceond ofall, l was porrrayed as a paranoid oursider who had no idea whar he was
ralking abour I did nor errraer my concerns from a cloud in me sky hoping ro gain
some name rocognirion and spur rhe campus ro meaningless polieical acrion, The con»
cerns regarding me new adrninisrrarion and me Board ofTrusrecs that pur ir inro place
were broughr ro me before lever knew who Russel K Osgood was. Srudenrs who had
parricipared in rhe question-and-answer session wirh rhe~ President when he was a cane
didare lasr year lamenred rhe iacr rhar he had shown barely any knowledge, much less
appreciarion, otselrgovernmce ar Grinnell. lhavenor been here any longer rhan hehas
and i am yusr beginning ro undersrand me privileges, and complociries ofself-govct-
nance ar Grinnell. It is nor alvlmys easy ro conrend wirh, and I am sure iris even los so
for a new presidenr who is, and will remain, under pressure from me Board ofTrusrees
who linance, and rherefore ulrimarely conrrol, rhe social and aadcmic srrucrurc or
Gnnnell college.

While Molly Gardner made a polar ofnoring rhar “nor all srudenrs agreed" widi
my commenrs (and men proceeding ro quote one), she failed ro acknowledge that some
did' How do I know? They approached me and praised me for deciding ro publicly
voice rhese eoneemsl No where in my email did I menrion rhe “eonspiracyr rhar Tom
Crady spoke of in rejecting my appeal ro rhc Grinnell communiry in be aware ofwhar
is happening around rhem. lam hard pressed ro believe mar our presidenr has no idea
whar l speak of when I refer ro narional rrends in eollegiare America when rhey are
being discussed in every form of media available from newspapers ro relevision
newsmagaunes.

ldo not doubr that Mr. Osgood has come ro Grinnell wirh vlnarhe sees as inebesr
inrenrions ofthc'studcnts in mind, But he is nor a monolirh aceounrable us no one. He
is nor iusr a represeneaeive ofStudent Affairs (which i wholehearredly agree has made
many eliorrs ro meer rhe needs ofGrinndl srudcnrs over me years). He was broughr
here by rhe people wirh rhc money which runs his school. Our counrry, and every
rhing rhar is a pan of ir, is becoming more conservacive. I don’t need ro whip our rhe
laresr srarisrio ro explain rhis “quesrionable rheory." Take a step all me grounds of
Grinnell campus. Go back home. I rhink you will begin ro undersrand.

i came ro Grinneu College speciﬁcally because it was diherenr, i came here specifi-
cally beause his school was known rhe laisscc-faire social policy known as self.gover.
nanoc. I came here because I knew I wouldn’t have re spend rwo years fulfilling require-
menrs in mam, physics, chemisrry, and every omer marerial science rhar I neirhcr grasp
nor have rhe desire ro try to. loamc here bmause l wanred a dome ro be immersed in
academic and social freedom for just four lousy years.
