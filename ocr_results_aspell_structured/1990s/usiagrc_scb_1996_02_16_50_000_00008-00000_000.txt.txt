Radical Chic

setting out to Comfort the arlltcteti
and amict the comfortable

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

My column last week on my
intention to forgo voting has caused
me to be (tiretorically) bopped about
the head, I have raised some can»
cernsamongmyfellowGrimellians,
indeedamongsomeotmybestrriends
here: “Doyou really beheve that stuff
you wrote?" “Where have you been
living!" some people have also been
quite laudatory, but it's the negative
comments I find most perplexing.

To explain my position further,
1 am convinced that no good comes
from voting. In tact, whoever I vote
for, i am embracing a genocidal for—
eignpolicywhich allowsthe death of
20-40 million people every single
year, and the slow starvation offully
1.3 billion (one—fourth ofthe globe).
Good people look the other way and
continue to lwe happily within the
system, as good people did in Hitler
Germany. We cast our ballots every

earning money and having tun as if
the Situation were less dire. Well, we
may be leading cushy lives here at
Orinnell, and much of the United
States may be living the good lite as
well. But we are living the good life
on the backs of the world’s poor, and
people are dying for our privilege.
Every one of these people is as be—
loved by God as I am, you are, your
parents are, your lover is,..

Perhaps I should have been more
upfront about my Values paradigm-
Mywholevision is based on my read—
ing of Jesus‘ teaching that we love
one another. I prefer not to discuss
my faith because people get Visions
ofBibIe—thumpingtelevangelisrs. As
I related in my first column, I believe
that the point ofhuman existence is
that we live for one another (“com
passionately”) and not to compete
wrth one another.

I believe that we are all called to
live incommunity; there is no reason
forpeople to live in theirownltomes
and with their own stuff, considering
the levelofpovertyandstarvation in
the world, I believe in the forces of
peace, compassion, human under—
standing, and not the false Gods of
war. competition, and judgmental.
ism, I believe thatsocial actionshoultl
he humantfocused, and not system»
focused. lbclteve thatsystems which
claim the power to kill. whether by
retention or a military or by capital
punishment. are inherently unjust.
and are no solution at all to society's
problems. I believe that all people
are basically good, and that systems
have the power to corrupt. I believe
that we are all called to live so that if
everyone lived thusly. the planet
would be sustainable.

I also believe that my vision for
llvlngandrelatingiseminentlyprac»
tical. Jesus did not set tip a church,

did not tell people how or what to
believe. He did tell us how best to
live our lives. Tire way we have been
living doesn’t work lust look at the
level of suffering and death in the
world. where over 750,000 Iraqis have
died since Bush declared war a little
over 5 years ago (500.000 and grow.
ingftomthesanctionsplacedonlmq
after the war), where one—third ofE.
Timor's population has been massﬂ»
cred by US ttmlned Indonesian
troops using U.K, and U,s,.inatie
weapons. Similar situations extst
throughout the entire third world:
Populations are dying from U 5.
weapons, trait 'ng, and money. And
not one poli cian in the united
States feels guiltyenough about these
heresies to even make a fuss. It is the
nature of ,ingoism in congress that
she (or he) would he laughed right
out ofoffice. But this blood is on all
ofour hands. Our representatives
represent us.

I pray every morning and
throughout my day that war. starva«
tion, and exploitation wtll cease. I
pray for an end to the Violence and
hatred in my own heart. And it de-
fines my faith that I believe these
things will come to pass. As King
stated so eloquently, “The scales of
history tilt toward justice." once,
abolitionists were labeled quixotic
Visionaries (or killed and tailed),
Eventually, they were seen to have
been correct Wars \Hll cease when
we will it As long as we vote for
people who are willing to prepare for
war, willing to see the death penalty
exercised (and Clinton has expand.
editandcolled forwiclctuse),willing
to stand idly b' as 20—40 million
people starve to death every year.
well, then we get what we deserve,

Dole and the Republicans, they all

of the Iraqis, the E, Timorese, the
Kurds inTurkey, the Haitianpeople,
the Mexican people. i wonder ifall
the people who vote in U, . el
tions could explain to these people
who have been victimized by Repub—
licanaiid Dcmocratalike (often rriucli
worse by the Democrats) why they
cast their ballot. I choose to vote
with my feet. vote with my life, and
act on my conscience.

ec-

1 would like to convince people
to give up on violent solutions to
conflicts, but it would defeat my en«
tire being to use coercion to do it. I
hope, at least, that you will consider
my arguments Please don’t dismiss
me Without really thinking about it.
We have all been told our whole
lives that voting is our civic duty. It
is tough to entertain challenges to
this paradigm (I spent seven years oi
my life assiduously devoted to the
Democratic Partyil’resident of
Young Democrats, internship at
Democratic H.Q., the whole deal),
Please try to listen And then go with
your conscience,

Letters to the Editor.. .

March is the cruelest month“.
To whom it may concern:

Every year we dread the onset of
spring, and we do so forone reason in
pﬂrnculai‘iihe mindless promotion
or the over—rated, overhyped orgy
which has come to be known among
its practitioners as the DISCO FEST.
Each spring, the senseless displays of
the testosteronerdriven “Men Who

els of excess as these “disco freaks"

Racism here in Grinnell
To the oririneil Community:

I am a firsbyear AfricaneAmcre
.tan male on this campus irom House
ton, Texas. evaluating my first se«
mestcr on this campus

This is a very Challenging camv
pus full of new ideas with just the
right type and amount of students
and faculty to implement them. The

curriculumisone that takestimc and
energy to master lam dealing with
those issues in a ”timely manner,”
but there is one general issue that
bothers me, that is, racism/race rela»
tions in this town and college. I say
this in light of the Spring 1995 pro»
test by students ofcolor and in light
ofan incident in town that disturbed
me.

one January night, I was ivallo
mg back to campus irom town with
sixotherAfrican—Americanstudents
and an alumnus when two young.
white females shouted to its, “KKK.l ”
When it was clear that none of us
would respondthe femalesthenpro—
ceeded to say something along the
lines of. “KKK, does that mean ally-
thing to your"

Sharing this experience with
otherniemhersoftheAfticairAinen
icancommunity, I became aware that
this behavior could be expected in
town. Other racist acts toward Afri—
CﬂlPAmEi'ICﬂn students were then
shared with me.

Thisexperience remindcdmeof
the time when a white police officer
stopped the one Sunday morning in
the middlcclass section of Houston
for no reason. It reminded me olthe
tiine uhen an Asian-American offi»
cial watching a large group niwhite
people Viewing an evhihtt, stopped
ii arching those people tofollow moi
and only meiotollutl the rest ofthe
exhibit

In light of these three isolated
incidents and a protest that posed
main- questions to onnnellians, I
find miselfposttig the following two

questions:

1, How much longer should we,
as students and Grinnellians, keep
silent on issues ofrace on this cam-
pus, town, and country.7

2 How much longer should my
African/American peers, or any race
for that matter, tolerate racial injus-
ticcl

At thiscollege and in this town,
students are taught critical thinking
skills, 1 pray that we use those skills
to address the above questions and
others that I did not name. I know
that there is no simple solution. I
know that racism cannot be eradi-
cared overnight. I recognize the {act
that we cannot change everyone’s
behavior, but can we make an at—
tempt to try!

Before I end, I must say that I
have no animosity towards the peo—
ple in this town, not anyone for that
matte t, based on the actions ofa few.
I just hope that we can had it in our
hearts to change the world
