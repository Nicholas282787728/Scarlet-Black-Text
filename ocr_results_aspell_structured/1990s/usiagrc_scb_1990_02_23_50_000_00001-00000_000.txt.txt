STUDENT
INITIATIVES

To Abolish International Quota

Whereas the students of Grinnell College consider international and American students to beequals as Grinnell
students and deserving of equal treatment; Whereas Grinnell College‘s quota limits the numberoi international
students who can panieipate in off-campus programs, singles them out , and makes them the victims of an unfair
policy; Whereas Grinnell College's international students constitute 8% of the student body, but they are lim-
ited to only 33% (i.e. 5 students) of the off—campus study positions per year; Whereas Grinnell College does not
deﬁne ”international students." leading to ambiguity and possible misinterpretation of this term as it applies to
the quota; Whereas current international students were not informed of such limitations and quotas before they
became Grinnell students; Whereas this policy was derived without the consent or advice of the intemational
studentsor the International Students' Office; We. the students of Grinnell find the quotaon international students
to be discriminatory and unjust We call upon the college administration to retract this policy.

To Install Accessible Drinking Facilities
We, the students of Grinnell College. strongly believe that Grinnell College does notprovidc adequate drinking
facilities for the physically challenged. As Main Hall is the only residence hall designed to accomodate
