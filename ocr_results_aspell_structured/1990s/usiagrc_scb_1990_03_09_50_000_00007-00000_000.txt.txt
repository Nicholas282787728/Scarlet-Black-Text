Survivors of Sexual
Abuse Speak Out

To the editor,

We have been silent too
long, We have clenched our
teeth and bitten our tongues,
wondering what we did wrong:
“What’s wrong with me? Why
did this happen to me?" We have
been silent, fearing you would
tell us that it didn't happen. that
we’re crazy. or that we deserved it,
‘But it did happen and we’re
not crazy. No one deserves the
horror of rape, sexual abuse, sexual
assault, or sexual harassmen.
‘No one “asks for it” No one asks to
be betrayed. to have their bounda-
ries violated, or to be denied as a
person.

- We have been warned not to
yvalk alone, and that we are safe
if we avoid the shadows and do

not talk to strangers. But we get
abused, even when we cower in
corners and lock the doors. The
betrayer is more often than not a
friend or a relative, and s/he does
not always wait until dark. Often
we have been molested in our own
rooms.
oftentimes we hear people
talk about sexual abuse. They
wonder how it’s possible that
so many people have been hurt.
They question the statistics.
Surely it can't be that many, be-
cause they don't know any survi-
vors. But you do know someone.
Chances are you know several
people who have experienced sex-
ual coercion in some form or an-
other.
It is time for us to break our si-
lence. We honor our strength and

creativity in surviving painful,
humiliating acts and invite other
survivors to do the same. Please
don’tpity usasyoltrpitytrivializes
our experience. What we want
from you is your respect We have
lived through horrors and we are
surviving,

Moderate, Respectful Response
Needed For "Mature" Campus

To the editor,
_ The past two and a half years
at Grinnell have taught me 3

‘tot about the ways by which hue
man beings solve problems. I’ve

seen issues come and go, per-
sonalities ridiculed, and lots of
ridiculous articles about almost
gny issue you can think of. Per-
haps the most telling part of what
I've seen at Grinnell. is how
quickly issues have descended
from a rational debate of issues,
to emotional mud-slinging and
needless character attacks.

~ I’ve seen hate leuers to Mike
Kent, hate letters written by
Mike Kent. letters saying abor-
tionists are baby killers, and
letters saying that anti—abortionists
oppress women, letters saying
white men are the ultimate oppres-
Sors, and letters saying white men
are oppressed, and the list goes on
and on.

Unfortunately. it seems to be
the case at Grinnell. that people
who are the most vocal on
campus are also so emotionally
involved in issues that they
become so biased they end up
sounding incredibly ridiculous.
That leaves a large void for the
rational people in the middle.
These people, who are moderate
pcmocrats or Republicans, who
aren’t really sure about the
abortion issue, who admit white
«tales have done many oppres-
sivc things, but that they’ve
done some very positive things as
Well, and those who admit the

college administration has its
faults, but don’t think it is simply a
collection of unconcerned idiots.
are left looking for sensibility in
a sea of irrationality. In essence,
these people are concerned
about each issue. but aren’t so
emotionally tied to the issue to
losesightofthefaetmatthere really
are two sides,

This campus needs a voice
of moderation. A voice that says:
it’s okay to disagree with Mike
Kent and not insult his perso»
nality; that says: I really think
both sides of the abonion issue
have some good arguments;
that says: I think the Bush ad»
ministration implemented some
good and some poor policies,
that says: I'm either a Republican
or a Democrat, but I respect the
members of the opposing party
and their beliefs: that says: I
think there are lots of problems
all over the world, and I Want to
help to solve them, but let’s do
it in a rational effective way
and not by a series of irrational
quick-ﬁx solutions

I’m not sure that such a vorce
really can exist on this campus.
For all of the knowledge that
we possess as Grinnell College
students. we’ve got a lot of
grownlg up to do We nctxl to
rise above the emotional out-
bursts that so often are the
responses to issues on campus.
Let‘s all try to be it little rrlore
respectful to our fellow human
beings. some of whom happen
to disagree with our dearly held

beliefs, and, if we can, let’s res—
pond with positive rational
arguments instead of childish
character attacks. Let's all use
those brains that we all have and
think 7 before we speak.

Do Cultural
Weeks Give
Distorted
Perspective?

To the editor.

I am addressing the issue oerw-
ish Cultural Week. Althoughlcon-
sider myself an active member of
Chalutzim, the Jewish Student
Organization, this letter represents
my personal thoughts on the week.
I am not speaking for Chalutzim,
nor for any other member of the
group.

I was an organizer for the week
and am pleased with the schedule
of events that were planned. It was
my hope that we would have a
variety of events that would both
reﬂect some of the Jewish culture
andgchrinncllstudcntswithvary-
ing interests involved in the events.
Thus, we designed a week that
included such events as storyrlcllr

THE LEI-'1'

A Small Battle in
the "War on Fur"

By John Newmark

I overheard a conversation
recently. and thoughtI might share
it. I don't know who the people
were, so I will just call one Polit-
ical Activist, and the other Fur
Wearer. Now that I have nicely
prepared you for what will follow.
listen:

Political Activist: l-Iow disgust-
ing! Do you have any idea how
many minks died in order to make
thatcoat?

Fur Wearer: Probably not very
many. considering this is made
out of rabbit fur. How many
animals died to make your
shoes?

PA: My shoes?

FW: Yes. Your shoes are made
out of leather. All leather is is
shaved fur. And what about your
coat?

PA: What’s wrong with my coat‘7
It's notmadc out of the furofpoor,
innocent rabbits.

FW: No,it'smadeoutofthefcath~
ers of poor. innocent ducks. It‘s
called down.

PA: I can change to acoat without
down, I guess.

FW: OK. what are you going to do
with it when you outgrow it?

PA: Throw it away, why?

FW: If it’s not made of fur. it is
probably madeof synthetics, which
aren’tbiodegradable, and will sit in
landﬁlls for hundreds of thousands
ofyears.

PA: Well, thatdoesn’t change the
fact that fur coats are still made at
the expense of the lives of innocent
animals.

FW: But you wear non-biode
gradable coats at the expense
of the lives of the innocent gen-
erations to come. Which is more
important, your children and
grandchildren, or rabbits and
minks?

PA: I.,.ull.

FW: Sowcshouldn'twearcoamat
all, perhaps. We will then catch
pneumonia. And if we refuse to
lake the medicine that was devel-
opcdatlhccxpcnscofanimal lives,
we will die. So what'smoreimpor-
tant Thclivcsofanimai's,thclivcs
ofyourchildren’schildren, oryour
‘own life“

PA: The problem Wlth that qUeS'
tion is wr‘ shouldn't mike a rlcm»
sion. A . id humans should
be treated as equals. The lives lost
at the expense of nonrbiodegrztdr
able clothes are a lot more indirect

than the animal lives lost to make
fur coats,

W: I bet you are also upset at the
fact that many of these animals
were raised merely to be slaugh-
tered. and believe this to be even
more inhumane than slaughtering
wild animals.

PA: That‘s true.

FW: Butifyou got rid ofall furs,
like you claim to want those ani-
mals wouldn’teven beraised. They
wouldn’t even exist, Isn’t a short
existence better than no existence
at all?

PA: That would be ﬁne logic, but
those animals’ existences are not
humane. Those who breed rabbits
and minks for the fur trade treat the
animals horribly. ‘ V
FW: So if humane mles were
established for the fur trade.
wearing furs would be all right?
I’A: Wearing furs is never
all right, the animals are still
killed.

FW: But at least they live, right?
And besides...

PA: Besides what?!

FW: Ifll'loseanimals\veren'tkillcd,
they would breed out of control,
there wouldn't be enough food for
them, and there would be starva-
tion. Nature would do what man is
doing now. So why shouldn't man
benefit?

PA: I don't have to listen to your
human-centric statements! (Politi-
cal Activist turns around and
walks away) And sexist for that
matter! Woman would benefit
too. Soon America will realize
what London at least already
knows. Wearing fur is equivalent
to genocide.

FW: (Laughs) At least Aspen
doesn’t lllink so, (sticks hands in
fur pockets, and walks off too,
smiling)

You don’t believe this conver—
sation really happened? That’s not
my fault. I’ve only written down
what I heard; itdoesn’tmatlerlome
whether you believe it or not. By
the way, the Fur Wearcr’s refer-
once to Aspen was a reference to
theovcrwhclmingdefeatofabill in
Aspen,Coloradotobecomc thefirsl
“fur-free" city in America. The
Political Activist‘s reference to
London was a reference to the fact
thatHarrods,tholargestdepamncnt
sturein all ofEurope, hasannoullccd
that it u .ll no longer sell fur, Tears
