Successful start for new club

Skydivers shoot up with only drug where coming down is the best part

By Jim Kropa

Fl‘ER lying dormant for most of the fall

semester, the Grinnell College Skydiving

Club sponsored its first parachute jumps
two weekends ago and Wednesday In all, 54 Grinr
nell sludean and two staff members made jumps.
Some people jumped twice.

Clubeororganizers Mike Hannaand Mattl-laber
were the first tojump. “I was the guinea pig,” Hanna
said. “I loved every second ofit." Hanna Said that the
ideaofa skydivingclubcameto him lastsummer. He
suggested the idea to Haber at prerregistration.

“I started it because I bunjeejumped and found
that it was boring, and the next step was to
jump out of a plane,“ said Hanna.

Prior to their falls from an airplane 3000

jumpers underwentabouteight hours of train
ing from veteran skydivers Dave Brown and Bruce
KcnnedyoftheIowaSkydiving CompanyinOttulnwa.

Mostofthe training dealtwith theproperinethod
ofexiting the aircraft. Instead of simply running out
the door, a proper exit involved grasping the wing
strut, edging out to the end and letting go.

Brown, who remembers “Ihedays when sex was
safeandskydlvmg wasdangerous," has logged over
1400 jumps and describes himself as an cx-hippee.
”Every group has ils own unique kind of party," he
commented at the end of the training. “Bikers have
their own kind of party. Skiiers h ' their own kind
of party. When you go to a skydiving party, it’s a
whole new indoctrination into parties.”

Another big partofthe training was in learning
to steer the large, docile student parachutes after
deployment. "The main thing is to find a good area
and land in it,” Brown advised. “If you hit a house,
you're really f—ed up."

Despite Brown’s advice, perfect landings were
rare. Sophomore Alex Cohen, who jumped twice on
April 25, said that he had Lmuble locating the target
on the ground from the air. “I landed in a cornfield
about a mile and a half from the drop site. They had
to come pick me up,” Cohen said.

Some students were skeptical as to whether the
club would ever actuallyjump, according to Hanna.
“Matt and I like to laugh because we showed them
otherwise,” he said.

Hanna was not only thrilled by the actual jump.
but also by the role that he played in organizing the
jumps. “What makes it all worthwhile is seeing the
looks on people after their jump—they were so
happy~and I can take some selfish pride that I

helped them do that,” he said.
The first jumps, according to FAA antl USPA

mar newts

(United States Parachuting Association) regulations, .

were“stauc line"jumps, in which Iheripcord is pulled
automatically by a tether attached to the aircraft. After
five successful static line jumps, parachuting students

are allowed to advance to jumps With a practice g

npcord, and then their first freefalljump.

Haber, Hanna and Cohen all said that they are ,

planning to get Class A parachuting licenses while
they stay in Grinnell over the summer. ”I‘ve never
done anything consistently in my life," Hanna said,
“but if I can make a prediction, I'll probably do this
for a long time to come."

Hanna also hopes that the skydiving club will ~

remain active, although insurance liability policies
threaten to shut it down. “Ifyou notice a plane ﬂying
around over campus, that’s probably an indication
that there’s skydiving going on." he said.
