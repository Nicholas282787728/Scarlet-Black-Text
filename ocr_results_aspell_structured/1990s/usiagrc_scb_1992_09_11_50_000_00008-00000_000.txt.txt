College art collection displays
recent acquisitions

by Michael Kavanagh

On display now at the Print and Drawing
Study Room in the Burling Library basementis
a collection of recent acquisitions to the Grin-
nell College Permanent Art Collection. This
exhibition includes an extremely heterogeneous
group of paintings, drawings and etchings,
[tom early modern masters like Matisse and
Picasso to contemporary Iowa artists.

Cenainly the most eye-catching piece in
this show is an unusual painting by the Minne-
apolis artist Frank Gaard. entitled M ondritzn's
Snowshovel (In the Villa of Mysteries). The
painting incorporates a red, blue and yellow
snowshovel, a naked woman with grotesquely
oversized hands and accentuated nipples, a
bust on a Nee-Classical style podium and a
cannonrlike duck wearing a beret. All these
images are set against a fleshy, peach-colored
background, which, according to the artist, is
supposed to be "the most seductive element in
the painting, like candy or sex"

Gaard, who is an accomplished artist and a
professor at the Minneapolis College of Art
and Design, claims his inspiration for the paint-
ingarose from “thinking aboutthe coincidence
ofPiet Mondrian and Marcel Duchamphaving
lived in New York City at the same time. I
imagined Mondrian calling Duchamp on the
telephone and asking him for a
snowshovel...The results are a red, yellow and
bluesnowshovel! 'I‘hlsisasimplc combination
of Duchamp's rcadymade sculpture: In Ad-
vance oflz BrokenArm (anordinary snowshovel
Duchamp purchased from a Manhattan hard
ware store) and Mondrian’s signature colors
red, yellow and blue." Gaard says the painting
is an homage to those two early modern mas-

ters, from whom he has gained much inspira-
tion.

The graphite drawing Memoranda. by Ada
Medina, is also an intermting work. Almost
Magritte-like in its surrealness, the drawing
super-imposes a skyscape on a gable-roofed
house-shaped form. The trompe tie l'oeil this
superimposition crcatcs is accentuated further
by the painstakingly realistic rendering of the
forms. Medina is an Iowa City-based lesbian
artist, and hcr striking drawing was a gift
donated to the college by the Louise Noun
Collection.

Anothcrrecently acquired work is a portmit
by J. Carlos Ferguson, who graduated from
Grinnell College this Spring. When outstandr
ing artstudents graduate frotn Grinnell, the Art
Acquisitions Committee does its best to add
some of that student’s work to the Permanent
Collection. Also included in this show are
several etchings by Sara Tabbcrt. who also
graduated Lhis year.

Honey bees and a humming mind

7 Iowa women perform play about Grinnell graduate

by Kendra Ford

Honey bees and n humming mind: the play,
Just Suppose: The Story aflowa Novelist Ruth
Suckow is about a woman who had both. It will
be produced Thursday September 17 at 8:00
pm. in the Harris Center, The play is a traveIA
ing production sponsored by the Ruth Suckow
(pronounced Soo-coe) Memorial Association
and funded by the Iowa Humanities Board.
Just Suppose... was written by Iowan Rebecca
Christian. The play will be part of an all»day
celebration ofSuckow‘s life works in honor of
the 100th anniversary of her birth. Events in
elude: Scholar’s Convocation by Curtis
Hamack ‘49, a 4:15 pm. panel discussion by
members of the English Department and
Lccdicc Kissnne, who wroteSuckow’s biograr
phy, and finally the play in the evening.

Ruth Suckow is being celebrated on cam
pus because she attended Grinnell for three
years. She wrote a satiric story about her expe-
riences at Grinncll, entitledA Part oflhe Imti»
tutton. She was a well known writer in the
1920‘s and 30‘s butis now,unfortunately,little
known. Christian describes Suckow as “...a
slow, careful writer, compassionate but totally
unsentimental," She wrote of ordinary life in
ordinary towns. All of her writing turns to Iowa
forits setting but she felt that the stories thcm-
selves reached beyond the borders of Iowa.

Recommended readmgsincludc her shortstory
collection, Iowa Interiors and her novel, The
Folks which was a Literary Guild selection.

Rebecca Christlan,the author of the play
about Suckow, has written several plays and
has won several writing awards. She is a con-
tributingwritcr forThe/owan magazincChns-
tian has written the play both to portray
Suckow's character and to paint a social his-
tory, “I have tried to show her againsta backr
drop of American history, so we can see her
personal response to events like World Wars I
and II, the McCarthy hearings and Sputnick."
The play is a woman’s personal history written
as a one-woman show. with minimal staging.

Lenore Howard is the actress portraying
Suckow. Howard (with her husband) founded
Fly-by-Night Theatrics in Dubuque. She perr
forms frequently in productions in Dubuque
and was the star of a oncrwoman show once
before in a production of The Belle ofAmhe/st
about the poet Emily Dickinson. She is div
reeled by fellow Dubuqucrcsidentand Fly-bye
Night worker, Andrea Rafoth. She also has a
record of working on women’s productions,
including Who'sAfraido/Vtrgt'nia Woolf. The
production ofJusl Suppose... has turned out to
bean Iowa Women’s project, a public celebra-
tion of the most personal kind.

Travelling play confronts date rape

by Tom Zlablnger

The work-in-progress, Until Someone Wakes
Up, was performed in the Harris Center Satur-
day evening by students from Macalester Col-
lege.

Until Someone Wakes Up was inspired by
the growing topic of date and acquaintance
rape. According to Robin Warshaw’s book, I
Never Calledltkape,onein every fourcoilege
women have cithcr been the victim of rape or
attempted tape. This statistic was what in-
spired Carolyn Levy, director of Until Some-
one Water Up. to start this workrinrprogrcss.

After extensive research on her own, Levy
conducted a class With 21 students this past
January at Macalcster which focused on date
rape.The intensivecourse drew its information
from books, video tapes, various speakers, the
behaviors and experiences of the people in the
class and interviews with both rape survivors
and perpetrators.

The product oflhis class was a play consist-
ing ofnumerous scenes that cover not only the
issues of date tape, but the roles society pre-
scnts to men and women and the fact that men
are also victims of rape.

The play touched many sensitive subjects
likehomosexuality,relationships between par-

ents and their children concerning sex, and
domestic violence. The play was not solely
serious. Satire was used to show the absurdity
ofmanyoftheissuesinvotved.0neexampleof
this humor was when a little girl asked her
father, “Daddy, can we get an orgasm? My
friend’s sister got one and she said it was
great...Why not? Is it too expensive?"

But the power ofthe play was the shocking
reality of date rape. Another statistic menr
tioncd in the play was that someone is raped
every six minutes. Throughout the entire per»
formance, a bell rang every six minutes.

There were molncnts in the play where the
Grinnell audience cringcd. Other times the
audience laughed But the play is definitely an
cmouonal and controversial one.

Levy says that “for some of [the viewers]
this play may hurt. It may open old wounds.
Butlhopethathhe viewers] willflnd [theplay]
ultimately empowering, to find [their] experi-
ences validated, For others..,, I hope that the
play will make [them] think and reexamine
[their] attitudes and behaviors. And if
anyone...is changed, even 3 bit, then we have
been successful.”

The Macalestcr students in Until Someone
Wakes Up will be touring and performing all
over the Midwest this semester.
