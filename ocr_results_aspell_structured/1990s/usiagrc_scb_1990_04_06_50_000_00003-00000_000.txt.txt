Minneapolisrangwith thevoices
oflhthinnell College Singers this
spring break. The choir performed
in Minneapolis and surrounding
towns on a week-long tour. The
group, made up of 36 Grinnell
College students chosen through
auditions, gave concerts for
churchesandhighschooiaudienccs.

The Singers’ repertoire ranges
from contemporary Soviet works
and pre-revolutionary Russian
pieces to more traditional Ameri-
canand Europeanchoral selections.
The trip gave the group a chance to

 

perform to a variety of audiences.

For Kathy Henson, this trip was
just another typical spring break.
Henson has been a member of the
Singers for three years, and has
toured with the group each year.
Although she described each tour
as a little different; ‘There are
different_people, and different
places Last year we were in Chi—
cago, and the year before we were
in Kansas," Henson was quick to
note that one thing always stays the
same-~"We have a let M fun."

John Stuhr-Rommereim, direc—
tor of the Grinnell Singers, was
very enthusiastic about the tour.
and about future travel of the choir.
Hewasespeciallypleasedwithhow
the group responded to their audi-
ences. “They were able to be spon‘
taneous At two places we got
standing ovations!” Stuhr- Rom-
mereim hopes that next year, the
tour mightbe expanded to theEast
Coast “We hope to cover more
territory,” he explained, citing his
desire to, “go a funher distance at
least"

The Singers have remained in
the Midwest for the last to spring
tours. and Stuhr—Rommereim said
thatthegtoupis striving to gointer-
national. “This is really sort of a
dream at the moment," he admit-
ted, but seemed conﬁdent that, with
outside funding, the Grinnell Sing-
ersjuslmightﬁndawaytoperform
in the Soviet Union in the spring of
1992

For now, though, the Grinnell
Singers remain in Iowa. They are
performing at 8:00 pm. tonight in

It was midnight as we flew over
Mexico City, and the lights shone
as far as the eye could see. The
teeling ofenleting a foreign city of
22 million people was tremendous.
Formany of us this was the first trip
outoftheUnited States. Our group
consisted of 11 Grinnell students
and five professors The day after
weardvedand settled inatthe Days
Inn (HolelRomano) near the Zona
Rosa, we began our orientation to
the city

Mark Bates, a Spanish profes-
sot,bought Metro tickets for every-
one and gave us a tour of the sub
way system. We traveled to the
locate, the center square of the
city, and then to Chapultepec Park
where we spent most of the day
touring the castle of Maxiinillian
and the surrounding areas. This
first day we began to get a feel for
the city life of which street vendors
are a very visible pan.

We began to understand how
much we take our language for
granted During the course of our
stay, it became apparent how cru—
cial linguistics are, as a search for
masking tape became a search for
“a toll of adhesive for a cardboard
box that we need to mail."

During the weekdays, we devel-
oped a routine which included rid-
ing the Metro to and from classes at
e] Colegio de Mexico with connec—
tor transpons called “combesf'
small mint-green VW buses con-
verted for public transponl Our
classes at the college included lec—
titres on foreign investment. inter-
national relations, Mexican eco—
nomic and social growth, history,
archaeology, political structure, op-
position panies, and social struc-
ture In the afternoons, we usually

met for lunch about one or two
o'clock Then,when no group tours
to museumsotaround thecity were
arranged, we had the afternoons
free to explore on our own For
dinner, usually eaten about nine
o’clock. thestudents weregiven an
allowance so that we could experi-
ment with differentplaces to eat. as
well as learning how to communi-
cate and‘get around in another cul~
ture.

In addition to observing and
interacting with urban culture, we

 

took several ﬁeld trips outside the
city. We visited two archaeologi-
calsites,TeotihuacanandTula.with
Kathy Kamp as our lecturer and

tour guide. Here too, vending was
seen as an important source of in
come, as vendors sold goods along
the Street of the Dead, anti even
sold postcards and trinkets at the
top of the Pymmid of the Sun. In
order that we could have a better
sense of the countryside, we also
visited two smallervillages outside
of Mexico City.

We experienced the culture of
Mexico while taking classes at the
sametimeand stayed in thecity, for
the most pan, during the full two
weeks. This made itpossible for us
to meet people, and gave its an
understanding of the culture as a
whole. As Dawn Akcy pointed out,
the trip also involved, “having to
explain our own culture to others.”

“Using the Spanish language for
the first time in a cultural context
made it more real," observed Leigh
Ashley.

This broad overview of Mexir
can culture was designed by Mark
Bates in an attempt to teach more
Americans about one of their clos-
est neighbors. In planning, Bates
counted on the fact that “Mexico
City has incredible diversities and
there are many things to learn from
the culture.“ In going to Mexico he
hoped that faculty and students
could experience those diversities.
This program served his purpose
by its integrative nature and the
interest and involvement of the
group itscl f t
