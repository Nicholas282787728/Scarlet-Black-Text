Physicians, local officials hear
U of l public health proposals

Local health-care professionals and
others learned Wednesday about a major
new public health initiative: the creation
ofthe School of Public Health, the ﬁrst
new college'developed by the University
oflowa since the 19305.

At a meeting held Wednesday at St.
Mary's Education Center, Christopher
Atchison, director of the university’s
Center for Public Health Practice, told
physicians, nurses, health administrators
and local officials of an effort to create a
statewide network linking the School of
Public Health with local providers of
care.

It'sbeingdubbedthelowaCommunity
Health Coalition, which Atchison said
will try to develop relationships between
the new college and various public and
private organizations related to commu-
nity and public health.

The university is seeking funding by
the lowa General Assembly for what is
being called the University oflowa de-
licl-lealthInitiativc(PHl)wlnch,accord-
ing to primed material distributed at
Wednesday’s meeting. “emphasizes
communityrbased measures to prevent
injury and disease and promote good

health.” ,
Training opportunities

The School of Public Health is the
centerpiece of that initiative and is in-
tended to set up new education aridtrain-
ing opportunities for public health pm-
fcssionals.

Graduate students enrolled in the
School of Public Health week seek a
master ofpubltc health degree. The ﬁrst
20 students will be enrolled in the fall of

this year.

The school also will offei'a certiﬁcate
in public health, a non-degree program
designed for public health practitioners
“to upgrade their education and training
in the core competencies of public health
practice.”

At this point, the Iowa Legislature has
not approved ﬁnal funding for the pro-
gram, but the bill has survived the legis-
lative “funnel" and is expected to be
debated by the full House and Senate.

Application seeks expansion of trail project for area

As organizers make progress on de-
veloping a bicycle trail that eventually
will create a link between Grinnell and
Rock Street State Park in neighboring
Jasper County, an erton now will be
made to secure additional funding to
build an inrtown parking area to serve
bicyclists while they hit the trail.

Members ofthe Grinncll City Counr
cil are expected to approve submitting
an application through the Region 6
Planning Commission for $40,000 in

funds to help pay for the project. An

owner Vernon Van Wyk has anr

MembersoftheGrinnellCityCoun-

fiveeyear tax abatement for the prop-
erty, which will be constnicted to the
southofthetwolongminirwarehouscs

facilities are located just west of Van

The council also is considering
whether to allow Van Wyk an addir

forgive a declining portion of taxes
overanotherﬁve-yearperiod. no decir
sion has been made.

Van Wyk said Wednesday that he
hopes to take possession of the new
warehouse by July, provided weather
cooperates and constmclion proceeds
on schedule.

Plans call for a 300 by 400rfoot
structure — 120,000 square feet in all

“[1 will be one big open room," he
explained. “One company may have
20,000 or 30,000 square feet, and an-
other may have 40,000. But every
thing will be in one room.”

The building will be heated, and
sprinklers will be inétalled for ﬁre
safety,

Companies utilizing the space Will

be able to store whatever products they
wish inside the new warehouse.

”There’ll be a little of everything,"
Van Wyk Said.

Because of the tight labor market,

Van Wyk called “the least laborrin—
tensive way possible."

That likely will change when lhcjob
market opens up a bit, he added.

Planning continues for Promised Land
Retreat In neighboring Jasper County

Aproject that is the brainchild of
a Jasper County supervrsor is
slowly taking shape west ofNew-
ton, and when it is completed it
will have cost an estimated $18
million and is expected to be a
majortourist attraction forthispart
of central Iowa.

The project is called the Prom-
ised Land Retreat, and its mission
statement is an ambitious one: to
“provideinterestedindividualsand
families with an educational and
religious experience oflife as the
Old Testament crossed over into
the New."

Supervisor Leo Van Elswyk has
been slowly lining up investors for
the project. He wants to see “a
biblical village” depicting “life as
it was 2,000 yearsago."

Trip inspired project

For Van Elswyk, the motivations
are both spiritual uplift and eco—
nomic development. In an inter-
view with The Herald-Register, the
ﬁrstrgeneratlonlmmigrant from the
Netherlands said he conceived the
idea for the retreat while visiting
his homeland.

Still only one way
to preserve AccessAir

Just about everyone who knows anything about the airline industry predicted
that AccessAir, Iowa's new carrier, would have a tough time ofit when the
dominant airlines began to match fares. That‘s precisely what has happened, and
Iowa politicians are wasting no time in getting involved in the situation

Congressman Leonard Boswell, who represents the 3rd District, has been in
contact with Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, urging the department to
look into the situation and determine if something can be done. Iowa Attomey
General Tom Miller also has gotten into the act, suggesting that TWA, Northwest

and Delta “may be engaged in predatory pnclng."

(lo something "

Boswell released a statement
Friday, noting that another airline that
once served the Des Moincs market
was the vrctim of a similar approach
by the major carriers. “Vanguard
Airlines was forced out ofour market
by these techniques, and now I fear
AccessAir could be next," he said.
“It's time for the DOT to step in and

The question, of course, is precisely what the Transponation Department can
do Thc lhrco airlines that have matched 7 or even undercut 7 AccessAir's
fares simply say that they're being competitive. But that‘s obviously misleading.
Their aim is to put Acce Air out of business, and they can afford to play the
waiting giimc, ercccssAir folds its tent, they’ll be gouging Des Moincs
passengers again. “The large airlines have consistently ovcr-pnccd their ﬂights
from our Iowa airports, forcing many travelers to travel three or four hours to
other EllmOllS to‘receivc up to hundreds of dollars wonh ofsavings," Boswell said

ln a letter to Slntci.

Once again, lltough, the only answer to the big camers is for lowans to support
AccessAir. A lot ofbusincsscs and industries have invested in AccessAir‘s
staiiup, and they're bound to remain loyal for as long as possible. But other
travelers whose destinations are New York City, Los Angelcs and other cities
served by AccessAir nectl to remain with the Des Moines-based camcr, even if it

He's quick to acknowledge that

Museum, amphitheater

Those for-proﬁt elements will
include such things as a motel and
restaurant But the main thrust will
be to develop a compound that will
include a museum, a tabernacle, a
shepherd area, an amphitheater for
pageants such as the Passion Play,
a synagogue, the Mount ofOlives
and even an area simulating the
Sea ofGalilee.

The projectbegan with l 13 acres,
and now another 100~acrc tracthas
been secured, tying the site in with

Ifall goes according toplan. the
project will progress enough this
year so that a temporary stage can
be erected for a production late
this summer, Van Elswyk said.

An advisory committee ofabout
a dozen people is doing the plan
ning. On board are the mayor of
Newton,ministers,business people
and Newton Chamber of Comr
meree members.

The land is located about 3.5
miles west of Newton, north of
U.s. Highway 6 and just west of

The Promised Land Retreat's
board is sponsoring a play, “At His
Feel," scheduled for March 27-28
