Place formally changed the name of the hall to Clark at a house

Students continue debate
of weekend health issues

A recent survey by the Health
Center Came across a “disturbing"
number of students who were un-
aware of what to do for weekend
medicalprobleins,saysDonnaBailey,
Director ofthe Health Center,

Apparently, many students are
so tised to relying on the Health
Center that they have never learned
how to get medical care when [he

mediate medical attention.

The general procedure for sin.
dents to get medical ddyicc outside
ofHealth Center hours is to call the
night watchman, who can connect

on—call. As it is not always clear to a
strident whether their problem needs
immediate attention, Bailey advises
“If in doubt. you might want to con»
suit the RLC for their opinion ofyour
problem, based on their past Emet—
gency Room utilization."

Getting transportation to the
hospital is often one of the biggest
hurdles for students with weekend
emergencies nur dire enough to re—
quire an ambulance. The RLC on,

Family Care (236»7524) has limited

and a doctor's appointment is gener»

An SGA senator suggested at a
recent Joint Board meeting that the
college open the Health Center on
weekends, because she had witnessed
a lot of weekend medical problems.
However. the adequacy of the colr

medical problems may not have a
true test until students learn how to
use them.

SEPC seeks more student
input in faculty evaluations

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

GrinnellCollege is changing its
system of evaluating faculty mem—
bersandinrroducinganewemphasis
on the student perceptions of reach—
rng experiences, The College facul—
ty proposed the new system which
was passed at twofaculty meetings in
spring 1994, and is under the opera—
rion of the Executive Council and
the Student Educational Program«
ming Committee.

“The goal is to find out student
reaction to ptofessors’teaching,"says
Charles Duke. the Vice—Presu‘lent of
Academic Affairs and Dean of the
College. “Student perspectives of
teaching are really impurrrinr."

The new system introduces two
evaluationquestionnairesaskingsru-
dents to express their opinions on
the performance of those faculty
members with whom they have in—
teracred.

Each academic department is
composing one questionnaire to be
administered in their specific cours-
es and toward the end ofrhe semes—
ter. These evaluation forms will
include all courses and all faculty
during each semester and were in-
troduced duringthe 1994—95 school
year.

Also, the Dean's office Will ran«

domly distribute another evaluation
questionnaire to students and alum-
ni who have completed a course or
term with a faculty member. “I actu-
ally thirﬂt this is more important
thanthe end—of—course evaluations,"
explains Duke, since students have
moved on to other courses or en—
deavors and may construct a more
thoughtful judgment after this perir
od of reflection,

End—of—course evaluations were
initiated during last year’s term, in
addition to the prevrous system, and
the Dean‘s evaluations were distrib—
uted two weeks ago. The College is
moving away from its old system,
which relied on a small group of
random student intervrews by the
Student Educational Programming
Committee conducted during re»
Views for contract renewal and pro-
motion. “The problem is that those
are only snapshots of the professors.”
as Duke explained, and that system
did not include every faculty mem—
ber not every student,

Overall. Duke expressed his op—
timism in the new system, and he
feels the SEPC will have better in«
formation with which to review and
consider faculty positions and per—
formances. These new procedures
will experience a threeyear trial pe<
riod.beginningthis year. afterwhich
the faculty willconsidermakingthem

The application period for the
Grinnell—in—London program, Grin—
nell’s largest OffCampus Studies
program, is getting underway, and
Michael Bell. ProfessorofAmerlcan
Studies and Anthropology, is excit-
ed. He expects that many students
have cause forexcitementas well:“It
started thisJanuary that the Europe—
an Union no longer required a pass—
port to [travelamong] countries,plus
the Channel, has made London even
more cosmopolitan," Along wrth
the resident London faculty, two dif»
ferent Grinnell professors teach for
the program each year. This Will be
Victoria Brown’s first time teaching
for Grinnellrin—London. She and
Bellwill jointly teach acoutse called

“Educating the Working Class."

Bell explains that he likes to
contrast English and American cul«
tures. He considers this fascination
ofhis to be a large part ofhis interest
in both the course he will teach with
Brown and his course on "Anglo.
American Encounters” between
American and English authors. Bell
thinks that one of the best parts of
the Orinnelhin—London experience
is the opportunity for hands—on ex—
periences relevant to the courses
taught. Bell cited sis examples the
planned “English Folksong and Balr
lad" class expedition to “The Bartell
Rolling." a holiday festival in the
southwest ofEngland, and the "Edu-
cating the Working Class" trip to
New Lanark in Scotland. the histor—
ic site of“oi\e of the great utopiun
communities." All these experienc»

escontribure to what Bell claimsGriir
“Ellelnehundﬂn is all about: the pro—
gram “tries to transform London and
England from a literary irnogc ro a
culruml image. Whrir we’re inrsrrsr.
ed in is giving people the chance to
experience English culture as it is
today." Bell thinks that one of the
foremost hesitations students have
about Grinnell—in—London is the col—
lective image of English life as stuck
in the more stuffy tunes of historical
novels.

 

l’rofessor Michael Bell

For a more accurate picture of
modern London, interested students
can attend a Grinnell—in-London inr
formation meeting Monday, October
9th, at 4:15pm in ARH 302. Profes—
sors Bell and Eroivn will address in»
retested students’ concerns. There
will be asecontl meeting on Novem-
ber 13th for students who miss this
first meeting. These meetings will
probably be the only opportunities
this semester to talk to Professor
Brown. as she is on leave, notes Bell
