Grinnell College

1 Alcohol Policy Disrupts
College Environment

By Mary Lou Singleton

In order to meet new federal
govemmentrcqutrements,Grinnell
College has adopted a new policy
regarding the use of alcohol and
d._s by students and employees
on the college campus.

The Drug~Free Schools and
Communities Act Amendments of
1989, signed by presldent Bush on
December 12, 1989, requires
schools, colleges, and universities
toimplementandenforcedrug pre-
vention programs in order to recieve
federal aid. Each institution of
higher learning must certify that it
has enacted a dmg and alcohol
policy which meets federal guide-
lines. Schools may be audited to
confirm that they are complying
with regulations.

Prior to the new legislation,
Grinnell had no dmg and alcohol
policy which met these require-
ments. Without adopting a new

policy. the college would have lost
over 2.5 million dollars in federal
funding, including federal student
financial aid and faculty research
grants.

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady appointed a sub-committee
of the Committee on Student Life
(CSL) in March. 1989, to develop
and recomcnd a new policy in
compliancewith the newrules.The
college was notiﬁed that it must
certify compliance with the new
regulations by SeptemberA, 1990.
Due to time limitations, Crady and
President George Drake decided to
adopt the subecommiuee‘s recom-
mendations before discussion by
the entire CSL.

The new policy states that
Grinnell College prohibits the line
lawful possession, use, and distrie
bution of alcohol and other drugs
by students and college employees.

Students may be brouglttbefore
the Alcohol and Drug Hearing

Board if a complaint is amde by a
student affairs dcan or by another
student. The board recommends to
the dean of students what sanctions
should be imposed. The sanctions
range from a verbal warning to dis
missal. The college is not required
to report offending students to law
enforcement officials.

Resident advisers are now re-
quired to confront students in the
dorms and off-campus collegee
owned houses that violate the
policy. Amy Aldous, R.A. for
Younker. Smith and Brown House
asserted that R.A.‘s are not the en-
forcets of the new policy. She
stated, "It's still aperson's own de-
cision" to drink or use illicit drugs,
but it is the R.A.‘s duty to "inform
students that they are in violation of
the policy" when they choose to
engage in these activities, lfa slur
dentisrepeatedly in violation of the
policy,theR.A. is requircx‘l to report
that student to Student Affairs.

to leave Grinnell College Citing a
desire to pursue an architectural
degree at Iowa State University.
Tindall resigned from his position
in mid-July . According to Vice
President Waldo Walker, the posi-

‘ tion will take at least a year to ﬁll

because of the thorough search
process.

The process, Walker said,
requires input from the next
college president, Since the presi-

Until the new physical plant
director is chosen, four people

Walker, will each handle a
different area of concentration.
