In Grinnell, as in many college
towns, the word Java is associated
with coffee; however, the Grinnell
College Javanese Music and Dance
Ensemble brings a different aspect
of this Indonesian island to tile
Grinnell community, Directed by
Roger Vetter and Valerie Mau
Vetter, this group consists of
Grinnell students with a wide
range of experience in Javanese
music and dance.

“For students studying this kind
of music, it is similar to studying
a' foriegn language Very different
from their own, such as Chinese.
I've always felt in my own experi-
ence of being brought up on West
ern music that after learning this
type of music I come back and hear
my indigenous music in a differ
ent way," said Mr. Vetter.

The island of Java is about the
size of Iowa, with 120 million in-
habitants. This very densely popu-
lated island produces a rich, flow»
ing culture. There are two large

not be interchanged

Another major way in which
Javanese music differs from western
music IS that there are no Compost
lions. Instead there are melodic outr
lines which the performers navigate
according to each individual musical
experience with tltelr knowledge of
“the technique and vocabulary of pat-
terns for an instrument. , . For this
reason ganlelaii performance can be
very spontaneous,
while at the same time
involving almost no
improvisation."

Javanese music
usually is not pore
formed exclusively;
usually it accompanies
theater, puppetry, or
dance and is part of a larger celebra-
tion or ceremony, Accordingly next
week's performan 'e will includ. three
pieces which will accompany dance.
Additionally, Javanese music and
dance are not usually performed in
concert halls. “This music is not tra-
ditionally meant for a seated, passive
audience. We made amends here to
cater to the expectations of a western
audience," Mr. Vetter said.

The dance portion of the Javanese
perfonnance will illcludeanumbcrof
different dance styles, These include
strong male, refined male, and re—
ﬁned female styles. These dances
also have variations such as court
style, which is very confined and re
fined and a popular style which is
more ﬂamboyant, less formal, and

livelier. The students performing,
Maggie McKee, Alison Novak,
Rhasheda Williams and Allison
Shaw, vary greatly in their experi-
ence in Javanese dance.

These Javanese dances are usually
performed in very elaborate costume
with very ornate beadwork on velr
vet. “Javanese dance is characterized
by fine hand, foot, and head move-
ments,As in moslAsian movements.

Gamelan performance can
be very spontaneous, while
at the same time involving
almost no improvisation.

the energy is very grounded and
rooted, with the knees bent and
movements close to the ground,"
said Ms, Vetter, who directs the
dance troupe, founded in 1989.
The Grinnell College Javanese
Music and Dance Ensemble’s con-
cert, which Mr. Vetter defines as “a
foreign musical language perforr
mance" will take place on Thursday,
December 12 in Roberts Theater.
Mrs. Vetter said, “We hope people
will come to enjoy this dance form
with its long and deep connections
with the court and popular culture
of Central Java, the hard work the
students have put into mastering this
challenging dance form, and the or—
nate costumes of beaded velvet,
tooled leather and beautiful batik."

 

YGB Choir to give
its Winter Concert

Group will release a CD in spring

BY MICHELE Hosr
Staff Writer

“Don’tcxpect to Come to the con
cert and sit with your hands in your
laps," warned Richard Pitt, Director
oftthoung, Gifted, and Black Gos-
pel (YGB) Choir, when describing
the clloir's upcoming Winter Conn
cert. YGB will perrcmi on Sunday.
December 8 in Herrick Chapel at

7:00 pin.
The choir will perform various

songs from its extensive gospel rep-
ertoire, including “Wait On The
Lord." "Totally,” “Now Faith,"
"Someday,” "Savior More Than Life
To Me," and “Wllatclm Lookin‘ For."
It is this last song which contains the
theme oflhe Concert.

Mr. Pill finds thematic importance
in “W'liaiclta Lookllt' For" for several
reasons, He says that tile song IS itnr
porlanl to the choir because of the up
coming Cltnsllilns holiday, alid also
because “people come to Gillincll to
look for answers."

This year has been an unusually
busy year for YGB, because the
group is about to celebrate its ihiru—
eth anniversary. The choir is preparr
ing to record a CD of original gos-
pel songs written by Mr. Pitt, his
friends, and choir members This CD
will be released during the spring of
1997 and is tentatively entitled “You
Chose Me." The choir is also orga-
nizing “Gospel Fest," which YGB
Will host at Grinnell in February and
will involve gospel chorrs froin
around Iowa.

One of the most exciting events
on theYCrE calendar is always the
annual spring tour,

In celebration of the group's
anniversary, this year’s tour will be
longer than normal and Will take
choir members to Dallas, Houston,
and Mexico.

Pitt urges Grinnellians to attend
this weekend’s performances, but
Cmphnsllcs that at YGB concerts
“the audience gives as much as the
choir docs,"

Computer Music Class to
share interactive compositions

BY LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

Students enrolled in Music 321.

Computcr Music will perform their
interactive computer music compo
sitlolts this Wednesday, December
11, at 7 pin. in Fine Arts 106,
' The students, all music majors,
have been working on their pieces
since Fall Break, and their profes-
sor, Jonathan Chcncttc, estimates
each student has logged about eight
to ten hours of work each week Since
then. The students spent much of
this time, he said, learning how to
use the necessary equipment and
evaluating the capabilities of the in-
strumcnts.

Mr. Chenette explained that, in or-
dcr to use the available equipment
to its fullest potential, his students
had to get‘ beyond the ﬂashy but
superificial facets of the computer
ized instruments and understand
how the technology really works.
He thus called computer mustc “a
very good pedagogical tool,”

He emphasized, too, that the ﬁeld
ofcomputer music is very dynamic,
and thus the range of skills neces-
sary for the class is dramatically difr
ferent from those learned by students
when the course was last offered
three years ago.

All of the works have Visual com-
ponents, Part of the requirement for
the final composition is that it have
“something for the audience to look

at." Mr Chcnclle explained, and thus
the projects are “all multimedia to a
degree."

Siudenis‘ indivtdual interests
manifest themselves in the work.
Some students are more interested
in the audio Capabilities oflhc com-
puter, while others spent more time
developing visuals. Thus, sortie
projects includc video clips, graphr
ics, dials, and other interesting imr
ages,

At some parts of the performance,
the audience may be called on to in»
teract with the computer, Mr.
Chenette said.

There are only rive students in the
class, but their work is diverse, Kevin
Garcia, who Mr. Chcnctte said is in»
terested in New Age muS1C, has de
veloped a computer audio gainecalled
“The Challenge." Mark Messer has
assembled an interactive performance
work titled “Create." Nathan
Germick, whose interests include
nonwestcm music and jazz, has cre-
ated a piece called “Dark Water,”
which incorporates the didgcndoo, an
Australian instrument, Mike Redfem,
who enjoys bothjazz and contempor
rary classical music, has composed a
piece called “The Magical
Minimalism Machine," Amy Kuccrar
who has developed what Cheriette
termed “a psychological story" titled
“The White Room," will perform live
alongside the computer. Kucera‘s pri-
mary interests are Irish and Celtic
music, Mr, Chenette said.
