receivtng posrttve response from
the college community.

Junior Morgan Toal com-
mented, “It's nice to see that
(Dining Services is) makingasmr

waste."

“I think it's great. I didn’t ﬁnd

about the plates, who also praised
Dining Services committment to
the environment.

McConnell also outlined olher
plans to eliminate waste. The Fo~
ruin Grill hopes to use only 5,000
Styrofoam. paper, and plastic cups.
as opposed to the 92,500 cups used
last year. This year, students will
be on an “honor system” to return
reusable plastic cups that can be
removed from IheGrill. Ol‘eourscv
McConnell pointed out, theexpcri-
ment with reusable cups will only
succeed if students relum them.

The implementation of the en.
tire plan required an investment.
that, provided plates and cups are
returned. McConnell believes will
be recouped within the next couple
of years. While 20 percent more
mun-hours were required at
Tuesday’s picnic, the increase is
only expected to be two or three
percent over the year.
