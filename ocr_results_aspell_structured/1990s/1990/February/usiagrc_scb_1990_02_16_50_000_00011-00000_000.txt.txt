Men's Swimming Victorious Against NEMO and Iowa Schools

By Steve Clem

The Grinnell Men's
Swimming and Diving team
stayed home last weekend. It
was at home in the PEC pool
that the team easily defeated
Northeast Missouri State

. University in a duel last Friday
night, and then sunk the entire
field in last Saturday's Iowa
Small College State Meet.

In Friday's duel, the
Pioneers outscored NEMO 113
to 98, though the score was
closer than the meet actually
was. As Pioneer Coach Ray
Oben'niller realized his team was
assured of the victory, he entered
Grinnell swimmers as
“exhibition“ for the last four
events, which allowed no points
to be scored for the Pioneers.

Grinnell had many
highpoints in the meet, as they

‘ won seven events, not including
the exhibition races. The
biggest highlight came in the
final event, as the exhibition
200 free relay team of Luther
Davis, Paul Froese. Joe
Zimsen, and John Williams

,broke the school record with a
time of 1:29.15. According to
the College Swimming Coaches
Association Best Times list, the
200 free relay would be ranked

Loyal Fans, Yes! Good Fans,

By Doug Hodum

As I sit through women's
basketball games, I am
constantly amazed at how
abusive the fans are. I
understand that emotions run
high when the game is on the
line, but is there really any
reason to verbally assault the
opposing players? I think not

Picture this: An opposing
player is fouled and is sent to
the foul line. As she prepares
to shoot, a single fan, quickly
joined by more, scream out,
“Noonan!” The player misses
the shot, and the fans feel that
they are responsible for the
missed attempt.

In this case, ignorance on
the fans‘ pan is obvious. Most,
if not all, players are oblivious
to the fans‘ comments when
they play. Some of the chants
that echo through Darby
gymnasium are just plain
classless, as well as
meaningless. The heckling of
players that goes on during all
sports, not just women‘s

' basketball, is pointless.

_ As an athlete, I know that if
I ever hear fans attempt to
hockle me, I almost go out of

. my way to embarrass one of
their players. You see, the
heckling will. for the most part
do one of two things. First, and
most likely, it will have no

ninth nationally.

The Pioneers also swept" the
200 free with a lst place finish
from Joe Zimsen, 2nd place
from John Williams, and Dave
Ressner in third. Phil Bishop
won both diving events. Zimsen
won the 100 fly, Williams
placed first in the 100 free,
Davis won the 50 free, and the
Pioneers also prevailed in the
200 medley relay.

John Williams takes a ﬂying start in the backstroke at the Iowa state meet.

Friday night‘ s festivities
was just a warm-up for
Saturday, when all Iowa
Division III College Swim
Teams were present for the State
Meet. The Pioneers continued
their unbeaten streak in this
meet, as they outscored second-
place Coe College, 470-261.
Other teams in attendance were
Loras, Luther. Cornell, and
Buena Vista colleges

effect at all. The players will
ignore the noise and do what
they are there to do. The second
thing is that it will motivate the
other team to embarrass the
home learn in front of a home
crowd. I must admit, I have
embarrassed players in games
just for the sake of showing up
the crowd.

Now, I know what you are
thinking. You want to know
what a home court advantage is,
if you cannot hecklo opposing
players and attempt to distract
them. Well, the home court
advantage is the comfort of
playing on your own court in
familiar surroundings, Just
knowing that the crowd noise is
for you. rather than against you,
spurs you on. The positive
noise from a chant, such as
“Tough D." is going to

motivate the home team.
Playing for a home crowd is
usually enough to motivate a
team to work extra hard for a
win.

I have been told by some
fans that the only reason they
are abusive is to satisfy
themselves. Even to this, 1 38k,
“Why?" What satisfaction can
you get by yelling out moronic
comments at players who can
[most likely not even hear you?
Iguess this' is just beyond me

Even though some of the
schools that we at Grinnell
compete against may not be
nearly the caliber of our
illustrious college, the fact
remains that the players from
those schools do have to
manage playing a sport and
maintaining decent grades.
This. if nothing else, should

Among the great events
were the one-meter diving, and
the 200 breast. In the diving,
Bishop won with a school and
pool record score of 323.60.
That score qualified Bishop for
the NCAA Division I National
Meet, Bishop also won the
three-meter competition.
Obermiller commented, “That
was probably the best I've ever
seen Phil dive in the one-meter,

'Well...

gain the respect of most people.
You see, if school poses an
academic challenge to you, it is
very difficult to do the school
work and participate in a sport.
I know that I admire any
student-athlete, because I know
how difficult managing sports
and academics can be.

So, the next time you are
attending a school athletic
activity, which 1 hope you do
often, try to be a bit more
respectful to the opposing
players. They deserve some
credit

Just remember what morn
always said, “If you can’t say
anything nice, don’t say
anything at all."

 

it was just excellent".
In the 200 breast, freshman
Mike Nield broke the state meet
record with a time of 2:17.74.
Nicld was being chased fiercely
by Zimsen, who ﬁnished second
with 2:18.36. Williams won
the 100 free for the Pioneers,
while Zimsen won the 2001.M.
The Pioneers also won both the
400 medley and 400 free relays.
Obermiller stressed that
although the first-place finishers
had outstanding times, the depth
paid off. “We've got young
swimmers, like Nathan Timm
in the 200 ﬂy, who are cutting
their times at an enormous rate.
I’m very pleased with the time
cuts, considering it‘s hard to get
emotionally prepared for a, meet
you are expected to win, ’said
Oben'niller.

The Pioneers are now
beginning to reduce the
intensity of their workouts, in
preparation for the upcoming
Conference meet. First.
Grinnell will host an
invitational tomorrow, with no
score being tallied. “We would
like to keep this meet relaxed,
so we can concentrate on
individual performances," said
Obermiller. The meet will
serve as a final test for
Obermiller to decide his
Conference meet line-up.

Tonight, the women's team
journeys to UNI. The men

The teams are undergoing a
tough training schedule in
preparation for the looming
conference meet, but intend to
use the meets this weekend to
qualify for the slate meet next
week; the top 12 athletes in
each event among the small
colleges in Iowa will be invited.
Following the motto imprinted
on the backs of the track sweats,
the teams plan on becoming
