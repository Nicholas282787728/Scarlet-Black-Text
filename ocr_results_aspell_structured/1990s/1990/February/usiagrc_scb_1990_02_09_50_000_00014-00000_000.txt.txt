view of Grinnell rests on his
interpretation of what a college is
supposed to be like. Kent seems to
have the View that a college should
be like a city. in which people of
different backgrounds and beliefs
are forced to coexist The key to
making such a city work is that the
ofﬁcial institutions of the city must
not express a preference for one
group or belief over another,
otherwise the city dissolves into a
collection of warring factions.

to abandon its philosophical
preference is rather like a
Republican delegate showin g up at
a Democratic Convention and
demanding that the party nominate
Richard Nixon.

If Kent is really as upset about
the nature ofGrinnell as he claims,
then he should seriously consider
uansferring, for to continue in a
situation which causeshim so much
frustration cannot be
psychologically hcal thy in the long
run. After all, if a person is
determined to wear a plaid coat,
why waste time trying on a blue
blazer.
