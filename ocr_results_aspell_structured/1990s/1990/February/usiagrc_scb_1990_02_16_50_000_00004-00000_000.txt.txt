Dr. Madeleine Korbel Albright
has been told that she has “the hot-
test topic going." Albright, Presi-
dent of the Center for National
Policy, and Donner Professor of
IntemationalAffairsathorgetown
University, was the Rosenfield
Lecturer for 1989-1990. Her leer
Lure, which took place Feb. 12 and
13, was entitled‘Tthevolutionof
1989 in the Soviet Union and East-
emEuropcandmeProspectsforthe
1990’s “

With the recent revolutions in
the Easlem European nations, the
abolition of Article Six of the So-
viet constitution which had guaran-
teed the domination ofthe Commu-
nist Pany in Soviet government,
and the announcement of a pact to
c’reate a uniﬁed Germany. intemav
tional politics are inastate of uncer-
tainty According toAlbright,“The
United States is in the position of
reactor, not initiator."

Albright feels that the new de-
velopments among the Warsaw-
pact nations resulted from a corn»

~ hination of a resurgence of nation-
alistic expression encouraged by in-
creased freedom of speech, the
realization that communism is not
a viable economic policy, and the
“gutsy"lcadershipot‘PresidentGor—
bachevs
The ﬁrst point that Albright
stressed in the ﬁrst half of her lec-
ture was that there is no homogene—
ous"EasternBlock."Sheexplained
that. while there is the common
factor of national pride in all of the
Eastern European nations, each
country is composed of different
ethnic and religious groups. and is
dealing with different border dis-
putes and economic class divisions.

Each Country also has a different
historyofrevolutionarymovements
and opposition parties, As an ex-
ample of this, she compared Po-
land's highly organized Solidarity
movement. which has been a “sec-
ond" govemment of sorts for ten
years. to Czechoslovakia’s Civic
Forum, a relatively loose associa-
tion of reform groups.

When asked why the revolutions
occurred in 1989. Albright's an-
swered thatone factor was that un-
refonncd communism no longer
seemed a viable economic policy.
“Communism seemed to work chI
initially during the early postwar
period,” she admitted. but, “The
Soviet Union was a undeveloped
nation, and a system of command
that sends orders from top to bottom
such as communism works well in
changingan undeveloped stateinto
a developed one. However, com-
munism doesn‘t work in a post-in-
dustrialized system because it
doesn’t allow for the innovation
and initiative necessary forastrong
economy" The communist eco~
nomic systems were thus crumbling,
and this promoted unrest

Albright explained that Gor-
bachev, as well, was responsible for
starting the ball rolling in Eastern
Europe When he came into power,
the Soviet economy was in a de-
pression. “While security was
important, it had to cost less." she
said. As Gorbachev turned his at-
tention inward towards the eco-
nomic and political problems of his
own counu'y. he encouraged other
communist nations to examine and
reform their systems. Albright
explained, “There had always ex-
isted these bubbling social forces
inEaStem Europe, OnceGorbachev
showed that he would not suppress

them. an infection of freedom be-
gan to spread."

This “infection of freedom,”
asserted Albright, spread through
the “freedom of information" that
formed thioughnew reforms. Soon
this‘infection”spreadtotthoviet
Union, 'I‘heBalticStaresfoundout
about the freedom from Soviet
communist control that Gorbachev
had been allowing in Eastern Eu-
rope, and began demanding those
same political freedoms at home.

For her second talk.Albright fo—
cused primarily on what she ex-
pects in the future for Eastern Eu—
rope, the Soviet Union. and the
United Slates,and their future prob—
lems and goals.

She stated that the chances for
survival of Eastern European na-
tions will beincreased if“dynamic
leaders," such as Lech Walesa of
Poland, are elected and prove able
to keep the support of the populace
through tough economic reforms.
She predicts these countries will
have to overcome inlemal ethnic
strifeandborderdisputeswithother
nations. Albright also explained
that to build strong economies, the
countries of Eastern Europe must
maintain close economic ties with
the Soviet Union while extending
an invitation to Western trade She
said that there was potential for an
Bstem European “common mar-
ket” to develop,

Albright stated that the Soviet
government is concemed with keep
revolution, speciﬁcally violent
revolution, from spreading to die
Baltic States. Albrightsaid that the
Soviet Union can no longer count
on the status quo to ensure stability,
explaining, “The Soviets are realiz-
ing that stability comes from
change."

Albright worries that the West-
ern nations may create virtual eco-
nomic colonies in Eastern Europe,
as the area is very attractive to
commercial interests with cheap
labor and production costs She _
sees a conﬂict in the United States'
policy towards theBalEic States with
our goals of encouraging peaceful
change and encouraging self-deter-
minationt

With the end of the Cold War,
Albright believes that “we have
passed through the simplestpen'od
of the PostrWar Era.” She come
mented that a strictly bilateral tor-
cign policy is no longer feasible.
It’s not “the good guys versus the
bad guys" anymore.

Closing her lecture series, Al-
bright remarked, “Events have
moved more rapidly than ever be»
fore. and they are irreversible. The
question is now, ‘Where are we
going'.7m
