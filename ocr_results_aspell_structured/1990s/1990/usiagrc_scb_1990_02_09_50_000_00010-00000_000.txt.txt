The Perfect Solutionto College
Bias: Calculate One that Suits You to "Kentian" Logic

Yo Mike!

Being scienceaminded people,
we cannot. understand your
discussion of ideology without
transforming it into an equation.
From your last article, we
determined this equation:

Average person 4» Liberal
college indoctrination = Evil,
liberal person whom Mike Kent
does not like.

However, we feel you have left

outan important variable. You do ‘

notaccountforrhe fact thatsomeof
us have been receiving
indoctrination all of our lives. not
just in college. College is a four
year experience that accounts for
roughly 1/6 ofyourlifeso far. What

Kent: Don't Attack Those

To the editor:

Thank you, Mike Kent! The
goalof“‘fhcl>resident'sCommittee
on Ideological Equity in
Instruction,”thatofensuringawide
variety of ideological perspectives
in our education, is applaudable.
Unfortunately, Mike, you chose in

your life? We, the writers, were
receiving a very strict conservative
indoctrination from our parents,
community, and society. and feel
that the liberal bias at Grinnell is
justservingtocounteractthatearlier
bias. In fact, some of us even chose
to attend Grinnell because of its
liberal atmosphere. So perhaps we
should regroup and use the
following equation instead:

Childhood (conservative
indoctrination)+ College (liberal
indoctrination) = Happy well-
rounded people who do not care
what Mike Kent thinks about
them.

While we do not object to your
board of bias judgment, we believe
that it should have a wider scope.

area of scholarship which has as
one of its primary goals the detection
of bias or exclusionary practices in
all scholarship: gender and

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Student Comments

on Welcome Return

To the editor:

After spending a semester
abroad, 1 eagerly looked forward to
getting back to Grinnell and
receiving a new dose of Kendan
logic. Therefore, I was quite happy
to read last week (Feb. 2. 1990)
Kent’s opening salvo in what
promises tobean exciting semester
spentmakingwavcs in searchof the
Truth. Let's hope the debate this
time can be conducted without
resorting to threats of lawsuits to
win the argument.

Kent wrote of his discovery that
Grinnell isan institution that fosters
aliberal ideology, and] would agree
that Grinnell has historically been
an active member of the liberal
school of thought. Kent further
asserted that Grinnell is somewhat
lax in examining and challenging
itsownbeliefs,anaccusationlagrce
is valid. This philosophical
blindness, ofwhich Kent wrote, is a
flaw in human nature which, sadly,
affects not only institutions but
individuals as well. .

‘ Kent interpreted these “facts" as
evidence of zr large sinister
conspiracy by the administration to
indoctrinate students into the evil

 

To the editor:

Tanweer Ala-am‘s letter (Feb.
2nd) is truly a feat. It not only fails
to respond to, let alone refute, ANY
of the points in Jordan Magill's
letter (Jan. 26), but it falsely
characterizes theletterr Speciﬁcally
Akrarn, while ignoring everything
MagillDID write,refersto“Magill’s
claims that in terms of material and
human loss the Israeli side has
suffered more than the Palestinian
side..."r This claim is nowhere to
be found in Magill's letter. Akram
is setting'up a straw man to knock
down.

Beyond the misrepresentation
that itcontained. Mr. Aloam’sletter
was doubly flawed. It fails to take
intoaccount that there is violence in
theMiddleFaston both sides Israeli
civilians continue to be the victims
of terrorist attacks, most recently
Sunday in Cairo where eightlsmeli
TOURISTS were killed and nearly
two dozen were wounded. Further,
the letter portmys the situation in
black and whim simplistic terms
which may be convenient for
propaganda purposes, but in
Akram’s own words, “Barely
correspond toreality”. Forexamplc,
in criticizing Israel for it’s
rejectionistslance visavistthLO.
Akram neglects to mention that the

 

Palestinian National Covenant, the
founding and guiding document of
the PLO, STILL calls for the
TOTAL DESTRUCTION of Israel.
It is true that Yasser Arafat claims
that those aspects of the document
are “caduque” and no longer
relevant But they have not been
repealed What then is tostop Arafat
from signing a treaty with Israel
based on a two-state solution, and,
in due time. when the strategic
balance has changed, declaring that
the treaty is“caduque" and nolonger

binds him?

The Palestinians and Israelis
have both suffered. Certainly both
sides need to acknowledge this and
move on. But misrepresentations,
and propaganda broadsides. that do
not take into account the suffering
on both sides and the relevantfacts,
do not serve the cause of peace.
Rather they serve to inflame
passions without increasing
understanding.

Author Responds to
Akram's Allegations

To the editor

I feel compelled to answer the
chargesleveledbyTnnweerAluam.
in his letterofJan. 26, 1990 Akratn
was allegedly responding to to an
assertionlmadethatmoresuffering
had occurred on the side of the
Israelis during than on the side of
the Palestinians, in the Israeli/
Palestinian conflict This statement
was by its very nature fallacious
since l havemade no such assertion.
I can only assume that Akram had
not, at the time of his writing, read
my letter,

The style of his response,
however, was in many ways typical
of the Arab»lsraeli conflict:
engaging in diatribes of hate,
where understanding through
dialogue was what was called for.
While such responses are to some
degree understandable from the
older generation. on both sides, who
have spent their lives knowing
nothing but hate, it has no place in
the House Of Peace that those of us
in the younger generation desire to
build.

ways of liberalism. He even went.
so far as to draw a comparison
between the educational atmosphere
at Grinnell and that in Nazi
Germany. Yet if this so-called
“brain—washing“ is the origin of the
effonslscearoundcampusbysome
students, faculty. and administrators
to work towards such goals as the
achievement of racial equality, the
end to discrimination against gays
and lesbians, and the establishment
of a humane policy towards the

To the editor,

While ﬂipping through the
campus lnemo just now. I noticed
that another group is starting on
campus—GrinnellColleger-Life
Organization Some of yourreaders
may think this absurd, idiotic, even
conservative. Well, welcomcto the
real world, Grinnellians!

Though I ﬁrmly advocate the
positionofPro-Cltoice,arrdcontinue
to ﬁght for the rights ofwomyn and
adolescents to use and choose
contraception methods, I think my
decision to support the prochoice
stance is an educated decision—
onc examining both sides of the

 

 

hotly debated issue. I wish more

homeless, then I think society as a
whole could stand a little “brain-
washing".

Kent's proposed solution to this
“brain-washing“ problem is to
establish some type of ideology
police The fact that this “solution“
has a far stronger resemblance to
the techniques of “a Stalinist re,
education camp“7as well x an
eerie resemblance to the effons
undertaken by the Chinese
Government to stamp out the
Student Democracy Movement;
than theproblemitseekslosolve,is
an irony that seems to escape Kent.

Even if we were to accept the
idea that an Ideology Committee
was needed on campus, and that it
would not threaten intellectual
freedom, Kent's proposal falls flat
in the execution. The key element
to make such a committee work
would be the ability of the various
committee members to agree as to
whether or new faculty person was
ideologicallydivcrscenough, Based
on my experience on CSL and in
SGA, whcrc meetings frequently
break down over the question of
how many balloons to order for a
party, thcprospecls of thecommittec
reaching some type of ideological
consensus, by which to evaluate
faculty members, is extremely low.
Furthermore, the effort is doomed
from the start because the fact that
thecommitteehasastudcntmajority
would guarantee that, like other
surdcntdominatedcommitteesany
conclusions they reached would be
ignored by the faculty and
administration.

I think the central flaw to Kent's

Pro-Life Group Will Balance
Campus Discussion

Grinnellians would educate
themselves aboutwhy pro-choicers
and anti-choicers believe what they
do. Instead, I believe our campus
has been yery one-sided in
presenting the facts about abortion,
3 womon‘s choice to have or not to
have one,and the consequences that
follow such a decision.

I applaud the formation of the
pro—life organization, because “us
educated Grinnelliatrs" need such a
group. Contrary to the “liberal”
opinion, we need the education, the
challengin gacttvc involvement, and
the tolerance an anti-choice group
provides.
