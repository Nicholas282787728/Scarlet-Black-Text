Fundamental
Rights of S&B
Central to Debate
over Rally Report

The debate over the recent
exclusion of the Scarlet and Black
from Monday, Oct. 29’s Take Back
the Night Rally has raised questions
about the fundamental nature of a
student newspaper. Many of these
concerns are expressed in the letters responding to last week‘s editorial
and deserve response.

Many of tile letters address the matter of aperceived “insensitivity" on
the part of the Scarlet andBlack to the needs of sexual assault survivors.
This is not true. Unfortunately, the nature of conﬁdentiality is such that
once someonegivesastatementtothepublic. coming forward of his or her
own volition, the statement becomes a matter of public record. Any
Grinnell student, faculty member, lownsperson or visitor could have
heard what wassaid. Therefore. it becomes a newspaper‘s rightunder the
first amendment to report the statement and the identity of the speaker.

However, regarding issues of high sensitivity, the editorial board of the
newspaper becomes responsible for using discretion. Because the staff
was never afforded theopportunity to makean editorial decision regarding
withholding the name of the speaker, it is impossible lobe cenain whatiLs
decision would have been. But, in all likelihood, it would probably have
chosen to keep the speaker anonymous.

', 'The staff is notlattempting to hurt any individuals. There is an
assumption in these letters that, as press, the reponcr and editors only
wanted a “sensational" story and were wtlling to disregard the potential
effects of printing names.

Only one intention guided the decision to shorten the Take Back the
Night coverage This was a need to maintain the newspaper's right to
report on events that occur on or near this mmpus. Lisa Ferguson
cri cizes the Scarlet and Black for its "holicrrlhan-thou” attitude, but to
not fight for this right would be an even greater mistake.

Another debate appears to center on the basic function of a college
newspaper. Many of the letters seem to suggest that the Scarlet and Black
has an obligation to report the event, but has no right to cover cermin
portions. This is a clear attempt to obstruct the media from reporting a
public event, and is unacceptable The editors of the Scarlel and Black,
under the jurisdiction of the Student Publications and Radio Committee,
dictates the editorial policy, and only the editors decide the content of
speciﬁc issues. Nobody else has any right to limit the scope and content
of a report.

Some letters also raise the issue of a “reporter" becoming a “student.“

They argue that the reporter asked to leave South Lounge could have
simply putdown a notebook, put awayacarnera and remained in theroom
to listen to the speeches. Unfortunately,changing roles is not that simple.
In the specific context of Take Back the Night, Ferguson points out that
the rally is a “cause" to he supported or not supported. If the Scarlet and
Black reporter were to suddenly remove the mantle of the press, and
become a ”student,” can the reporter be a neutral observer? Had the
reponcrs and photographers covering the demonstration against Iowa
Governor Terry Blanstad put away their notebooks and cameras and
joined lhcdemonstrators, students would have claimed the coverage was
biased. It is often difficult for the reporter to maintain this distinction, but
it is essential that it be done. And the distinction cannot be abandoned in
any instance, because it will call question to the reporter’s work in general

and the Scarlet and Black as a whole.

LETTERS TO TIIE EDITOR

Student Reacts to
Criticism of GCEH

 

Alumna

Student
Protest

To the editor,

As an alumofGrinneIH
fail toappreciatethe lackof
respect and courtesy
afforded the Govemorof the
State orowa.

Grinnell studenm should
be far above those actions
shown recently when the
governor was in the city of
Grinnell and on the Grinnell
campus. To disagree is one
thingtoshuwdisrespecland
lack of courtesy to anyone is
another, especially a high
official, a guest of the
college—your guest.

Grinnell has a fine
reputation. Otherwise why
select this college for
undergraduate work? Why
beresponsible foraspersions
cast on your college and
possibly discouraging
contributors to the college?
One contributor has already
taken action; how many
more will see fit to do
likewise? How many
students seeking ﬁnancial
help will be affected?

The high intelligence
which admitted you to
Grinnell should always be
in use. particularly when
receiving guests on the
campus.

To the editor.

This letter is in response to two
letters of criticism directed at the
Grinnell Community to End
Homophobia (GCEH) and our
activities The criticism. I believe,
cenlers on theconceptofthe“ally."
An ally is a heterosexual who
supports tile civil rights movement
of homo- and bisexual people.

First, there was concern that the
pink arm bands handed out on
NationalComingOutDaylosttheir
meaning to the obsession with
“political correctness" (Scarlet and
Black, Nov. 2). The imponant
thing to realize is that the criticism
was in fact directed at the allies who
were wearing the arm bands. To
accuseahomosexualofresponding
to peer pressure in wearing them
would be truly ludicrous. Believe
me, I was too preoccupied with
fighting the urge to nonchalantly
hide my arm band to worry about
political correctness

Any attempt by a political
organization to involve a large
numberofpeopleinaspccificaction
runs this risk of“bzind—wagoning"
(or arm bandrwagonin g as the case
may be.) I, along with the other
members ofGCEI-I, were aware of
this risk. After eight years in the
closet, however, seeing those pink
arm bands was an uplitting
experience. This. more than any
vague notion of“political support"
is what Coming Out Day is for.

But the question of the allies'
motivation and place in the civtl
rightsmovemenlisavalidone,and
was raised in an earlier letter.
(ScarlemndBlack,Scpt. 28,1990).
The writer was concerned that the
GCEH was, by virtue of its name

change (from Grinnell Gay and
Lesbian Alliance),being,ﬁrstofall
too negative; riding “too deeply on
thatwhichisunpleasantaboutbeing
gay." If this “negative aspect“ did
not exist, there would be no need
for a gay rights movement. Given
the political nature of the group, it
seemsjustiﬁedthatthenamewould
emphasize this ”negative aspect."

More important to note,
however, is the fact that the group
took several weeks to decide on a
name. The writer of the letter
attended none of these meetings, to
my knowledge. I think that this is
unfortunatebecauseherpointswere
valid and would have been
welcome.

The writer was also concerned
thatthenamechangewaspandering
to moderately-oriented allies and
that the members were afraid of
standing on theirown. Thisconcern
hasbeenpresentinevcrycivilrights
movement. Many black leaders
have called for an all-black
movement, as many womyn’s
leadershavewantedtoexcludemen.
As a white male, I sympathize with
the ally’s position, as I feel
concemod with both issues. As a
homosexual, however, I, too, fool
pulled towards militancy. It is a
difficultquestion; one that needs to
be addressed.

One thing I feel absolutely
certain of. however, is the need for
unity within the homosexual and
bisexual community. Unity is not
an abstract concept. It takes a
conscious, active effort. Without
unity, there can be no action. With
no action, there is silence. Silence
equals death.
