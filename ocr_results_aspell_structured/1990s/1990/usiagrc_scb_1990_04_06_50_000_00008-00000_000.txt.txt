Tennis Crushes
William Penn to
Cap 3-2 Start

By Ian Gustafson

This spring the Men’s Tennis
Team began its campaign looking
different from last year‘s senior
dominated squad.

Coach Dave Arsenault is imr
pressed by the talent of this year's
younger group. Junior Captain
Ara Bulbulian agreed, adding that
the strength of the team is all
the more remarkable considering
there are only two returning
players.

The freshmen are Mark
Reynolds, Jeff Wooten, Peter
Greif, Bruce Broce, John Brent-
nall, Jason Wagner, and Jeff
Stadler. Coach Arsenaull likes
Reynold’s tenacious court
coverage, Wooten’s big serve,
Greif’s sound game, Bulbulian’s
power, Eroce’s athleticism and
potential, and Brentnall’s
dogged consistency, He added
that Jason Wagner has made the
most improvement since the start
of the season.

Coach Greg Wallace responded, “In

Lave 3rd at
Nationals
Sets College-
Record '

By Gerald Honigstock

The weekend of March 940,
while most of us were deeply en-
grossed in the work of m id-semester
exams, Jonathan Lave and Coach
Will Freeman were on their way to
the East Coast and Division Ill
Indoor Nationals,

As one of 12 qualifiers in the 8-
lap 1500M, Lave exuded exciter
ment'about his opportunity. He
showed in the semi-finals that he
was one tough customer by leading
almost the entire race, then falling
back to fourth in the midst of the
final sprint. Lave’s 355:4, a new
schoolrecord andapersonalbestby
.6 ofa second, was fast enough for
him to join the other six who made
it to the finals.

Knowing that the top six finish»
cts earn All-American statusas well
as a new race strategy helped propel
Lave to a 3rd place finish. After
hangingouton theleader’sshoulder
for the first 800M, Lave surged into
the lead for the next quarter mile.
then held onto 3rd place in the final
kick to the finish with a time of
354:4.

ln commenting on the races, Lave
exclaimed he was very plwsedwith
his performances, yet vowed to win
Outdoor Nationals in the event.

Over Spring Break, Lave trav—
eled to Gainesville, Florida for the
Honda Ralays, where heshaved ten
seconds off his school record

In his ﬁrst outdoor 1500M, he
ran away from the othercompetitors
in 3:55. His time earned him entry
into an invitational 1500M held the
next day.

Racing against Division I filh~
letes, Lave amazed everyone by
dropping six seconds from his per-
sonal best set at Division III Indoor
Nationals, and finished seventh in a
blistering time M3148, All told, ten
seconds vanished from the school
record,

Other athletes who attended the
Relays also did well, such as Lee
Kraemer and Darren Robertson in
the pole vault, withRobertson clear—
ing l4" for the firsttime. Soaring in
the horizontal plane were Matt

, Schrager and Mark Saint-Andre,

who have attained a remarkable
consistency in their long jumps

Meanwhile, Amy Reinhart
sprinted to a 13.10 second 100M,
very near the school record.

In the ﬁrst home meet in four
years, both the men’s and women’s
teams are hosting Carleton tomor-
