Sophomore Evan Zoeckler tn-
temedinWashington,D.C.lastluly
with Republican Congressional
Representative Jim Leach of Iowa.
Two other intents, one of them an
other Grinnell Student. Shelly
Fausel. also aided Leach in July.
Although a Republican, Leach is
known for liberal views on many
issues

Zoeckler received this paid po
sition after discussing possible op-
tions inWashington with friends of
his family who were acquainted
with Jim Leach.
Hehadtoarrangc
his own transr
portation and
accomodations
while in the
Capitol and de—
cided to stay at
Trinity College.

He worked a
AOvhour week on
Leach‘s staff.
His duties in
cluded addressr
ing constituent
coneerrts on nu-
merous issues.
which he researched in order to
understand them fully and to prop-
erly convey Leach's viewpoint to
his constituents in Iowa's 1st Dis-
trict

Zoeckler also assisted the press
secretary with filing. attended staff
meetings (something which most
interns were notallowed to do),and
listened to lectures that the intern
coordinator arranged during the
month.

According to Zoeckler, thou-
sands of interns can be found in
Washington. D.C. over the sum-
mer. He was surprised toftnd many
other students from Grinnell.

He recognizes that he was lucky
to be in an ofﬁce where there were
only two other interns. In some

”[ The internship is
only for people who
seriously want to go
to Washington since
there are times when
the work is quite
arduous. In many
oﬁ‘ices interns are
kicked around."

offices there are as many as 40
intern 3.

Even so. there were times when
there was little for him to do. and
this made thejob less exciting than
his previous experience in the po-
litical arena. when he worked on
Eric Tabor’s successful 1990 pri~
mary campaign for the second dis
trict. He felt there was a lot more
pressure and adrenalin involved in
working on the primary than in his
internship.

“You do this or that or else the
guy loses,“said Zoechler about the
primary. It was an election year for
Leach: how-
ever. he has
been in office
since 1976 and
ran unopposed
in the last elec-
tion.

In additon.
Zoeckler found
the long hours
and focused
goal of the pri—
mary campaign
to be “more roe
warding“ than
his internship.

Al th 0 u g h
the internship paled in comparison
to the primary campaign, he ran
marked that he felt his job was
worthwhile since it nee/Lied to be
done, and if he didn't do it. some-
one else would have had to.

He also enjoyed the warmth and
sense of cooperation in the office
and felt it was ”more tightly-knit"
than most.

Hewasable to hearLcach speak
at four different staff meetings and
had the occasional opportunity to
talk direct|y Willi him while in
Washington.

However. he relied on Leach's
administrative assistant for much
of his information on the various
issues with which he dealt.

Zoeckler looks at this as a “one-

 

time experience" andhopcs to work
locally in some aspect of politics
this summer.

Although he found the intemv
ship to be productive. he is not
quick to recommend it since “it is
only forpeople who seriously want
to go to Washington since there are
times when the work is quite to-
drous.”

“In many offices interns are
kicked around, and there's not
enough for everyone to do." he
added. He believed that one really
has to have “Potomac fever" to
benefit from such an experience.

One eye-opening situation that
he clearly recalls occurred during a
staff meeting when the issue of
censttring Representative Barney
Frank for his behavior regarding a
male prostitute was raised. beach
was opposed to such an action, al-
though many other representatives
were very much in favor of it.

Zocckler was shocked about
such blatantly homophobic attitudes
and was surprised that this issue,
which seemed to have too little
merit to result in Frank’s censure,
delayed discussion of the budget
and other “more imponant“ mate
iers for so long.

From this experience. Zoeckler
feels he learned to appreciate rim
Leach even more than he previ~
ously had. He especially admires
the fact that teach accepts no out-
of-state PAC money and that he has
taken a very hard-line stance on the
failure of the Savings and Loan
industry.

Funherrnore,Zoecklerwasvery
much impressed by Leach’s hone
esty and sense of humor.

Zoeekler believes that this sum
mer internship fits in well with his
career plans in politics. His intena
tion was to find a “niche" in poli-
tics and to “explorewhat he wanted
to do by using on-site experience.”
In this respect. he found the intem-
ship to be a great asset.

Alternative to Ski,
Slopes in an Iowa
Farm Community

By Helene Eisenman

Several Grinnell students and
professors will spend the end of
winter break in a novel way. By
living on the Mesquakie Indian
Settlement in the small farming
town of Tama, Iowa. Grinnellians
they will get well acquainted with
the Native American children there.

It is the latest chapter in a well~
developed association between
Grinnell and the settlement. Since
l987. the Native American Interest
Group (NAIG), which is sponsor-
ing the week long stay, has tutored
children at the settlement once ev-
ery week.

During their stay at the settle-
menttheGrinnellians will beliving
in the Tribal Community Center.
Their goal is to encourage the Na
tive American children to “getexV
cited about Ieaming." in the hope
that they will move on to higher
eduction. There are approximately
60 students who attend the
settlement's day school (first
through eighth grade) and another
60 who attend high school in Tama.

Many problems arise for the stu-
dents once they enter high school

ferent from that of the Settlement.
Some students become victims of
racial prejudice and may drop out
of school entirely. In order to re-
verse that trend. NAIG hopes to
Show the students opportunities
which they might not have consid-
ered as options for the future.

While at the settlement. the
NAIG members will conduct
workshops, consisting of two hours
of presentation and an hour of dis-
cussion. on such topics as science.
reading. games, music. cooking,
playwriting and newspaper pro-
duction.

In general. they will present
things that are fun for children.
Another part of the day will be
spent assiSting in classrooms in the
day school, Studentswillalso spend
time in service projects and talking
with the elders of the tribe.

The NAIG members say that the
parents in the settlement have been
very receptive towards them. They
think of the Grinnell students as
good influences on their children,
and trustthem. Mostof them would
like to see their children move on to
higher education. '

At the same time. the Mesquakie
have a tremendous amount of pride
in their culture. and they wouldlike
to communicate this to their chil-
drenas well. The fact that they own '
