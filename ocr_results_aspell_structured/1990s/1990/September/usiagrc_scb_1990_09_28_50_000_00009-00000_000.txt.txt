Lambada Fever Descends
on Students this Week

By Enc Bucks

I like concens and all that goes
with them. Even getting that boot-
print on the chest of my T-shirt.
Even seeing my friend stuff ear
plugs sodeep into his auditorycanal
that a security guard couldn’t find
them With a ﬂashlight. Evcn watch-
ing Flavor Flav fall off the stage
shortly after Public Enemy's Say
No To Drugs semen. Heck, I even
liked the way Bob Mould had the
Forum windows shakin' like San
Andreas. I mean, why bother to
organize ablood drive when some
body with a bunch of amps and at-
titude is gonna have us all givin'
blood out our ears?

Yes, I like live music a lot.

Imagine how giddy I was when
someone asked me, “Why not write
something about the next Gardner
party? They‘re bringin’ in a band
from Chicago." Already I started
stringing together college rock
cliche‘s in my head.

Iagreed. Then they let the punch
line fly.

“Yeah. they're a ten-piece lam-
bada band, supposed to be really

Really good atwl'iat'! All i knew
about lambada was it sorta rhymed
with Eric Estrada in a foreboding
sort of way. Not much to go on. A
coupleof phonecallslalerputme in
touch withAdinaSales,lames Hall
HAC and lambada monster. Seems
as if this whole Lambada Week is
her doing in preparation for the rip
roarin‘ James Hall Lambada Ball
tonight,

She told me little I didn't al—
ready know: the band is from Chi-
cago. plays lambada music and
nobody seems quite sure of how to
spell its name. She did promise that
it would play on Cleveland Plaza
from 7-10 pm, and be followed by
a post-lambada bash in Gardner]
Hector's (complete with all sorts of
music and a non-alcoholic keg) and
that it wouldbethebestlatin music
I’d ever hear.

Neat. but that still left me in the
dark about the band.

Sol did what any tutorial advi-
sor would have me do. I set off for
Burling to do research. First stop
was the reference desk. As helpful
as they were, I didn’t think any
amount of time spent with a
Reader's Guide to Periodical arty-
lhzng was gonna help me here. So
I grabbed a notebook and set off,
heck—benton interviewing anybody
I could corner.

“Hi, there’s a lambada dance
coming up this weekend, and I’m
not asking for a date. All the same
I’d like to know what lambada
means to you." And here’s what
they said:

JuniorZu Xin Yu thoughtitwas
“something Spanish," but admitted
that he probably wouldn’teatitat a
Special Dinner. Noteven with a lot
of hot sauce.

Caleb Rush was pretty sure it
was “a nasty operation where they

cut out part of your mind," And
they got SGA funds for this”

Eric Sandeen was comment that
it was “a big hoax. It has a lot to do
with corporate America.“ Yeah,
whatever. I guess you ﬁnd that sort
of stuff out as KDIC'S Music Div
rector.

Yvonne behind the Grill counter
said ll could be “a kind of bagel,"
Or not.

Pool-cue-packin' Dave Hardy
saw lambada as “the vertical ex-
pression of a horizontal activity."
You mean like go-kartin', Dave?
“No man. sex.”

Yeah, now we were gettin’
somewhere. Dave wasn’t alone.
Justabouteveryone in Burling was
spouun’ what sounded like the next
2 Live Crew single at the mention
of the Forbidden Dance.

Courtney Wells spoke of “knees
between crotches," while Joe Mat-
tem J r. went on about “movin’
one‘s hips like a paint mixer.” Kris
Koch described‘makin‘ likearolo-
rooler with one‘s pelvis.” Oh my.
“Don‘tbewearlng stuff with lots of
pockets because that‘s not where
you‘regonnabepuuin' your hands,"
advised another.

Does Jesse Helms know about
this yet’! Fearing this college was
going to break a federal statute for
dealing in some sort of pomog'ra—
phy across state lines, I called the
band’s booking agent in Chicago.
They assured me that SGA Con»
cert‘s Committee wasn't bringing
in somePiedPiper of porn who was
liable to incite 2 Mt Vesuvius of
hip grindin’. They were alsoableto
tell me the actual name of the band
and some other neat stuff.

”Dims out that The Samuel Del
Real (not Rio) Orchestra really is a
lO-piece outﬁt (hence the “orches
tra,“ I guess) featuring Columbian
born pianist, Samuel Del Real. Near
as 1 can tell they pack around a
bunch of horns and a percussion

Grinnell Students Maintain
Folkdancing Traditions

By Chris Doemel

The room is filled with the
sounds of tapping shoes, swishing
skins and dancing directions, all
accompanied by the music of a
Mexican band as the Grinnell
Folkdancers practice a new step.
As the music comes to a close, the
dancers laugh at their mistakes and
compliment each other on learning
a new step.

The Grinnell Folkdancers have
been around for at least 25 years.
At one time, folkdancing was tre-
mendously popular at Grinneil.

“There would be dances on Fri-
day nightsandNorthLoungewould
be crammed." recalled Barbara
Stone, faculty member and
folkdancer. “Back in the old days.
it wasn't odd for a graduating sen-
ior to krtow over 300 dances.“

Since then. the popularity of
folkdancing has suffered. Last year,
six folkdancers graduated from the
group. Today, there are only two

returning members.

“Twenty some people have
signed up. however," said Stone.
“If we can keep enough new people
this year} we'll do a show."

What classiﬁes a dance as a
folkdance't‘

“The folk do it." said president
Pam Bahls jokingly. “It‘s a tradi-
tionaldance,onethatispasseddown
through generations."

“The ‘twist' is dragged out for
the Grinnell Happy Days." said
Stone. ”They take all these dances
from the ‘50’s and ‘60’s and do
them. Those could become folk
dances, although now they are not
considered; they aren’t u‘aditional
or old enough. It takes in a lot of
territory.”

“It’s not ballet: it’s net modern
dance. obviously." said Eahls. ”but
we get just about everything.“

Through folkdancing, dancers
get exposed to the cultures of many
countries. The dances that they
perform come from Europog’rsia,
