New

Policy Meets
Student Opposition

continued from page 1

the policy include the fact that no
students currently enrolled at
Grinnell College sewed on the
parking committee and that the
policy was adopted over the sum-
mer while no students were on
campus,

The widespread opposition to

the new policy was expected by the
administration according to Work,
who declared, “Parking at any col»
lege or university is a no win." He
added that no matter what steps
were taken.there would mostlikely
never be enough and, if there was,
itprobably wouldn’tbeconvenient.

The policy will be reviewed at
the end of the semester.

They stood before the same
tough choices we stand today, and
waited too long (or so we though
for the last half century). And we

"Understanding the Global Struggles for
Cultural Survival of Indigenous Peoples"

Sept 13, 1990

1 1:00 am -- HERRICK CHAPEL

All are welcome to this event,

 

 

 

Africa's freedom is a worthwhile
cause. Meetings of S tudcnlstoEnd
Apartheid gather fair-sized
audiences, but no such group as,
say, Students to Free Cuba exists
In the interest of consistency,
liberals should protest human right
abuses wherever they Boccur in the
world, instead of dilating on South
Africa.

One more neglected fact
of Mandela’s organization is that,
contrary to its pronouncements,
it does not represent anything near
the entire black population of
South Africa. Witness the brutal
ﬁghting now underway between
the ANC and the Zulus, which
renders specious the notion that
Mandela leads all South African
blacks, It is time to recognize the
respectable, if less photogenic,
black leaders such as Chief
Buthclczi, who does not share
Mandela’s commitment to violent
struggle and is willing to negotiate
to realize a biracial, multiparty
democracy. Remember ,lhal the
enemy of your enemy is not your
triend, and even if you loathe
apartheid, Mandela's idea of an
alternative cannot be called
desirable either. His ascendence is
not in the interest of any South
African. black or white; and he is
anything buta hero.
