Reconsider New
Parking Policy

The new parking policy, because of changes that were affected after
student input ended, is ill-thought out and must be altered immediately.

lastyeai’s Parking Committee was asked to createapolicy that created
some funds for themaintenance of the lots and Iopay for students topatrol
the parking area. In order to complete its recommendation before the end
of the year , aproposal was passed during ﬁnals weekof last year to charge
a flat fee of $50.

Over the summer, without student input, the administration chose to
create the new system of $65 and $20 feesr Cenain lots were chosen to be
“perimeter” lots, while the lots closer to the dorms were marked only for
those students whopaid for theexpensive permit. Ownersofthe $65 grey
pcn'n it are also allowed to park in the cheaper tors

Sixty-ﬁve dollars is a ridiculous amount to pay for the right to park
behind theSouth Campus dorms,asopposed to Darby, Therefore, the vast
majority of students paid for the less-expensive “perimeter" permits.

Unfortunately, this policy has not planned for the possibility of lack of
space in the lots. If a grey-stickered car parks in a perimeter lot for an
extended period, owners of the 520 red stickers may be unable to ﬁnd a
parking place at all.

Charging for a service that may not be provided is inexcusable.
President George Drake told the Scarlet andBldck that the parking fee is
similar to the maintenance fee assessed to all students living in the
dormitories. But, this analogy is false. Alleastin the dorms, itisclcar that
the bathrooms and hallways will be maintained for student use. In the
parking lots, there is no such guarantee.

The administration must rescind the current policy. Iffunds need to be
generated, institute a flat fee between $20 and $30, which should be
sufﬁcient for current maintenance. Reconsider the parking needs of
Grinnell‘s students and the more responsible ways of adequately dealing
with them.

Grinnell’s Students
Have Been Be—"Tray"—ed

As studentsmusthave noticed,Dining Services has ftnallybegun using
those high-class, “unmarkable” trays that were secretly hidden only two
days after their initial use last August.

Now the white “unmarkable” trays appear to be here to stay, a most
unfortunate fact for Grinnell students.

Whether one realizes it or not, those lovable, “sledable”, markable old
red (or maroon, if they've been through the dish machine enough) trays
serve several imponant functions at this schooli Everyone must initially
concede that they’ve all looked for Alden or Flash or Kirby or Ziek on
those trays and had gobs and messy gobs of fun doing it. The trays were
a topic of conversation during what sometimes was a mediocre dining
experience.

Some of the trays, like the "’l‘ray Amigos” or that awesome eagle that
someone carved were truly works of art, and deserved to be hanging right
alongside the Mona Lisa or holding a beer for Michaelangelo‘s David.

What's more, people will have to steal hordes of those “unmarkable”
trays to go sledding. How can you see a white, “unmarkable” tray in the
middleofasnowstorm after you wipeout on Hamburger Hill’! You can't
People will steal more of them because they will lose more of them.

Carving on traysdidn’tappcal to thoseworldly virtues that Grinnellians
are supposed to have, but maybe students at Grinnell simply don't have
those virtues What we do know is this: Dining Services could have just
retired the really old rm ones and replaced them with new red ones, and
we’d all be super happy, That would also save the cost of buying
completely new, “unmarkable” trays. Instead, our favorite red trays are
gone forever, our nutritional fun ripped right out from under us.

LETTERS TO TIIE EDITOR

Search Committee Member
CallsS&B Editorial Divisive

To the editor,

I was disappointed to read the
editorialin tlteScnrlelandBlackof
Aug. 31 relating to the relatively
small studentrepresentation on the
Presidential Search Committee I
certainly applaud the interest and
concern of the student body in this
extremely important process.
However, it would be much more
gratifying to see that concern ex-
pressed toward the qualities stu-
dents wish to see in a new presi-
dent, or the most important issues
the college will need to face over
the nextdecade. Atapointmidway
through the search process (much
important work has been accom-
plished over the summer), such
number counting is both tardy and
divisive.

To place the process in some
perspective, l’ll point out that the
selection of a president is a duty of
the Board of Trustees; many would
claim itis theirmost important duty.

The trustees have seen fittoinclude
faculty, administration, present
students and alumni (an imponant
component of student representa»
tion neglected in the editorial of
Aug 3 l) on thiscommittee with an
equal footing relative to the tnis-
tees, Contrast this with the last
search which included Student and
faculty input only through advisory
committees; the actual selection
commiuee consisted of nine trus-
tees.
Itrustitwassimplyanoversight
that the Scarlet and Black failed to
report in its first issue the present
status of the search process. The
retention of a professional search
firm. some of the selection criteria
that will be used and the actual
screening process have been the
result of much intensive and
thoughtful discussion. The com-
mittee is remarkably devoid of
factions and vested interests, The
suggesteddwdlineforapplications
is rapidly approaching, with well

over 100 applications and nominate
tions already in hand. And while it
is too late to change the position
description, there is still time to
suggest speciﬁc qualities that will
be important in a president, or to
nominateapotential candidate. The
process is remarkably open. and 1
encourage students,facultyandstaf f
to take advantage of the openness if
they have specific concems.

Mark Bi Schneider
Assistant Professor of Physics
Member, Search Committee

(Editorial Reply) There was no
oversight in LheScarlet nndBlac/c’s
decision to wait until after the Sept.
5 meeting of the search committee
for this week's article on the
committee’s progress. Also, the
Aug. 31 editorial was the ﬁrst op-
portunity that the Scarlet andBlack
had to comment on the committee,
as the members were notannounced
untilafterthefinal issue last spring.

Teach—In Raised Questions About
Our Involvement and Responsibility

To the editor.

This week’s MiddleEastTeach-
In was the right activation for my
mind at the beginning of the
semester. Unfortunately, the
situation is different from what we
Grinnell students are used to: a real
“real life situation.” It triggered a
lotof questions: What isourrelation
to other countries, what do we want
itto he? Are we (the US) justusing
this as a pretext to show the world
our might and to polish our ego?
Do we (the world) care about
Kuwait or the oil’.7 Is there anything
we could have done in advance to
prevent this situation? Should we
have changed our life style and
how? Do we not only have to
change our style of living, but also
our way of thinking? What do we
stand for, what do we stand up for'.7
And finally: is there a way outwith
only a bmlscd eye and not a dead
one?

In the few minutes I attended,

me discussion centered on one
question: are we doing the right
thing? People around the world
asked themselves the same question
about half a century ago. They
knew about the altemativesjust the

way we do: war. appeasement or a
miracle, After more than two
generations we still remember their
initial choice, the Munich

Graduation Facilities Showed
Lack of Concern for Students

To the editor,

There’s an old saying that one
can determine if a restaurant cares
about its customers by looking at
the conditions of its bathrooms. if
we translate this to colleges, one
can determine if a college cares
about its graduates (and their fam-
i1y and friends) by looking at the
GraduationWeekendactivitiesand
facilities.

Grinnell did arrange the cus
tomaryactivities forgraduation but
during one particular. but very im-
portant instance, showed complete
disregard concerning facilities.

I'm referring to the postrccrv
emony picnic at the PEC where
very few tables and chairs were
available for people to sit comfort»
ably and enjoy the meal, Myself
and many graduates were very dis-
turbed when ourparents and grand-
parents had no place to sit and were
forced to sit on the floorr After
spending over $65,000 for a four-
year education, parens should be
provided with at least a folding
chair to share with their child the
last few moments at Grinnell
College.
