Dracula Sinks Teeth into
Personal Interpretation

By Jennifer Mattcs

“I love Sandy’s philosophy,
explains senior Than Mitchell
regarding theater Professor Sandy
Moffet’s general approach to
drama as a director. “He says ‘I
'don't believe in theater that isn't
fun.’ I think that's great."

, This approach certainly
pervades the current theatre
production of Dracula which
Molfet is directing this semester
at Grinnell College.

“I’m not a particularly big
horror fan, but the fact that the
genre is so huge and pervasive»
that is interesting to me," Moffet
commented.

It‘s likely that most people
associate the Dracula legend with
the cluster of black and white
vampire films that Universal
chumcd out at an alarming rate tn
the 19305. They were scary then,
but laughable now. The mvth
has not weathered well, and has
become thoroughly ingrained in
the collective American popular

consciousness. Its prevalence has
desensitized its effectiveness as a
narrative vehicle. Moffct
proposes to overcome these
inherent problems by util ing
experimental techniques during
the plays production.

The actors are not working
with a solid, preewritten script.
Instead they are reading a wrde
variety of source material, which
includes Bram Stoker’s setnmal
late 19th century novel, folk
tales, contemporary fantasy
literature and movies, from which
they hope to generate and
improvise their oWn scenes.
Sophomore Ryan McNaughton,
an actor in the production, is
particularly interested in a
sympathetic, “anti-Stoker"
account of a vampire written by
Fred Sabcrhugen.

,The core acting ensemble is
allowed a great amount of
flexibility, as they are free to
improvise and create their own
scenes and individually shape
their characters. Moffet said that

during the play actors will
interchange roles with each other.
He wants the audience to
cxpcricnce the different levels of
meaning and interpretation that
the different actors would convey.
ConsequenLly, the traditional
narrative continuity ofa play will
be absent from Dracula. The
repetition of scenes will laminate
this process. With
unconventional techniques.
Moffet hopes to achieve a more
abstract effect, with “many gaps
and ti lot of spaces” for the
audience to fill in for themselves.
Moffcl allows that his

ﬂexible directing methods can be .

difficult. “It's a scary thing
they‘re doing.” But he stressed
that this type of production is
good for student actors, because it
pushes them away from the
security of a script and forces
them to rely more heavtly on
their own creativity.

like to perform up on stage; it
gives them a great feeling.“

Of course, the audience as
well will benefit from Comedy

“Laughing is so therapeutic. It
makes you feel good. With all
the stress we have here, we need
