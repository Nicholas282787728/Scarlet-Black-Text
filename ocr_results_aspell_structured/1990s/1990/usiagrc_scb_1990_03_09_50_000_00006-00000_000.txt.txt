for New Campus
Security Measures

With the attack of a suident last week on Mac ﬁeld, campus safety and
security has once again emerged as an issue. While the best solution is for
students to travel in groups and take proper safety precautions, this is not
always possible. We feel, therefore, that increased security through
means of additional lighting as well as insisting student patrols would be
the best solution.

The campus-lighting proposal made by the Safety Committee, if
implemented soon, would provide improved lighting for several pans of
campus. Areas such as the North Campus loggia, the field between Darby
Gym and Younker, between Goodnow and the Fine Ans Building, and
most of South Campus are some suggested sites where we feel the addition
of new lighting would be most valuable. The new type of lights proposed
would also be directional so that they would illuminate the ground more
than the current lights do now

The mpe whistles, while being a good idea, have proven to be ineffec-
tive thus far. When a student is attacked, the victim has little or no time
to locate the whistle and take it from his/her pocket, bag, or wherever 5/
he may be carrying iL And if s/he does manage to blow the whistle, there
are often no people within a reasonable distance to respond with help.
Because of these reasons, we are advocating the creation of student
patrols. The patrollers would be student learns equipped with ﬂashlights
and whistles Rather than depending on volunteers like last years doomed
escort service proposal, this wouldbeapaid positionmuch like the current
security workers at parties. Not only would the patrol discourage attacks
from happening, but if an incident were to occur, there would always be
someone near to provide help.

These suggestions are no substitute for the safety that can be found in
numbers, but they are some steps that can be taken to improve campus
security. It is time that some measures be taken before another incident

occurs.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Disgruntled Grad. Criticizes
Student Affairs Failure

To the editor,

Grinnell College students
beware! The greatest obstacle
between you and acceptance into
the graduate school of your
choice may not be a weak grade
point. standardized test score.
or essay, It may be your friendly
neighborhood Students Affairs
Ofﬁce.

Most graduate schools require a
“Dean‘s Evaluation" forth to be
completed by the Student Affairs
Office, showing any academic
or disciplinary penalties a student
may have incurred while at Grin-
nell. We worked hard. put up with
most of their bull shit, and com-
pleted and paid for our education
(or soon will); this is theirjob—not
a favor.

This form is a one—page,
one—sided 8 1/2 x 11, three
question, fill-in-the-blank ques~
tionnaire. With Grinnell’s “state
of the art" computerized record
system, the entire completion
process should take no more than
15 minutes, tops. Granted the Of-

fice is deluged by these forms all at
one time in the year, but Grinnell
doesnothave thatmanystudentsor
alums applying for grad. school in
any one year: It's not exactly the
size ofthe University orowa. Hell,
it's not even the size of my high
school.

To say the least Grinnell has
failed miserably in this simple task
for at least one recent grad. The
Student Affairs Office was grossly
negligent and irresponsible in its
duties, going so far as to even lie to
me about the status of my evalu—
ation.

One form had to be returned
to me before I could send the
completed application to a cer-
tain school. The fon'nclearly stated
the application deadline and that
it had to be returned to me prior
to this date. After a month and a
half of waiting. two and a half or
three weeks before the Feb. l
deadline, I called the school,
semi-panicked and was told that
this evaluation had just been
mailed out. This would have been
the week of Jan. 8. One

week before the deadline, I
called the graduate school to ex-
plain my situation and plead for
mercy.

I ﬁnally did receive this evalu—
ation. It was Feb. 3, two days
after the application deadline. A
notation on the back said that
the form had been completed
Jan. 20, at least a week and a
half after I was told that it had
already been mailed out, and the
envelope was posunarked Jan. 30,
two days before the application
deadline

Luckily I was still able to apply
to this particular school, but if my
chances of acceptance have been
diminished duetothenegligenceof
Grinnell, the college may very well
be legally liable, and I may be en—
titled to damages.

Just something to keep in mind,
Grinnell students. when the admin i-
stration starts feeding you a bunch
of as. about how important you
are to them and how great it is to be
a Grinnell grad.

Professor Responds to "Enviropanic"

To the editor,

The article (“Enviropttnie”) by
Mike Kent (Grinncll‘s own Rush
Limbaugh) deserves a response.
First, it is a fact that. in the past 100
years, the global average tempera-
ture HAS increased by about l.5
Fahrenheit (not Celsius). There
have been cooler years alternating
irregularly with warmer years, but
the overall trend is up. It is also a
fact that, since 1958, when routine
measurements were begun, the
amount of C02 in the air has in-
creased from 315 ppm to 352 ppm
ntpresenL (It is signiﬁcantthztt, in
the early 1950s,plantphysiologists
were using the measured value of
300 ppm.)

Some would argue that this trend
in world temperature is merely
a blip in the overall temperature
regime of the globe in the past
few thousand years and isofno sig-
nificance. The truth is that we
cun never be sure until it's too
late. We do know, however, that
the “greenhouse effect" is the
consequence of atmospheric C02
and is responsible for the tcmr
pernlures that have made our

, earth habitable. lfCO’l levels in-

crczisc (projected from known “1'

_‘ crease in the past 30 years) in the

ncxtltall—ccntury,can we cxpcctun
“enhanced” greenhouse effect? If
so, how much, and what will be ils
ramifications?

Contrary to generating an
“enviropanic” in order to generate
income for themselves. scientists
are doing us a favor by alerting us
to their concerns. Rather that adopt
a “head»in-the-sand" or a “what,
me worry?” attitude, we should
be listening carefully to what they
have to say. Although their fears
may never be realized (which I
doubt), it seems that the very least
we can do is encourage strategies

that will reduce C02 emissionsi
developing more efficient automo-
bile engines and energyeofﬁcicnt
appliances, exploring renewable
energy sources, planting lots of
trees, etc.

Come to think ofit, shouldn’t a
sensitive, wise. caring society be
doing these things anyway?

Groups Do No Harm

To the editor,

In general, I think that respond
ing to Mike Kent’s column in the
Scarlet and Black is a waste of
time. I know that by responding to
his column,oneisonlyhclpinghim

ever, cvcn with knowing the above
to be true, I still feel the need to

he deems “Enviropnnic.”

I could understand Kent‘s bitter
view of public exploitation by an
organization if it had to do with
little old lztdtcs being swindled out
of social security checks. That is

not the case, however, with envir

giving their money to a non-proﬁt
group committed to making social
and legislative change. These
donors are not left like the little old
ladies. These donors see their
money going toward specific ac»
tions that have advantages for the
whole planet.

Likewise, I could understand
Kent’s low opinion of Greenpeace

their use of”enviropunic for politir
