', WHOSE RIGHT?
Liberty vs. Common Courtesy

Rights are funny things. I have
them, you have them, we all have
them, but when oneperson’s rigth
infringe on those of another, who
has the “right” of way?

I had never really thought about
this until one day last week. I was
visiting a friend in Norris Hall, and
I happened to look out the window
and see an American ﬂag lying
stretched out on the ground. I
wondered why, and was
immediately struck by the urge to

' go pick it up, fold it, and take it
home with me where I knew it
would be treated with a little more
respect than that, What I saw next
sent my mind reeling. A Grinnell
Collegcstudcntsatdownandbegan
to burn a corner of it.

Aslran down the steps] triedto
think of what to do next. I couldn't

. begin to think of a reason why
someone would protest something
in tttis mariner while sitting quietly
in tttemiddleof Drake plaza. Come
to find out, this was to be a part of
a Halloween costume; the student
had decided to dress as “censored
art." I told her that I was extremely
offended, and that I very much
wanted this to stop. Unfortunately.

becauseof my outragc,thelanguage
I used was a bit strong. For thisI
would like to apologize to the party
in question, but] will notapologizc
for my opinion nor my outburst.
This person undeniably had
every right. to do this, but did she
have the right to do so in a place
where others, who might be
offended, could not help but see’.7
Had thisbeen apcrson sitting alone.
telling “faggot." jokes or “nigger"
jokes aloud to herself, she would
probably have been asked to Stop,
and were the individual acourtcous
human being, she probably would
have. How different are these
situations? If the party felt a bumt
ﬂag was necessary for her outﬁt.
why not burn it somewhere out of
the way, where no one would be
bothered by it? Seeing a burnt ﬂag
would have disturbed me, but I
cannot begin to express the
emotions I felt when my request to
stop was answered wittt, “...don‘t

look.“ How could I help but look?
That “piece of cloth” symbolizes
everything this country stands for.
The souls of our ancestors are sewn
into each star, the blood of our
Soldiers stains each eripc, the love
ofevery thankful American blazes
across the deep blue ﬁeld. To say
that thatﬂag belonged to the person
in question is denying these facts.
To say thatI overemphasize the
meaning is to negate any meaning
whatsoever. I am nota blindpatriot,
nor am I a conservative t‘tagwaver,
but I am acitizcn ofwhat [consider
to be one of the finest nations ever

Seeing someone treat this
symbol with suchblalantdisrespect
made my stomach turn. I do not
wish to be subjected to this ever
again. If she had been making a
statoment,orprotosting something,
it would have been a very different
situation, but this kind of frivolous
desecration is an outrage. My
constitutional right to happiness
was indirectly violated, but when I

The Branstad Protest: Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing

The f ulminating protest against
Govemoernstadlastmonthmade
a mockery of civility and common
courtesy, and was hardly in line
with a commitment to the rights
of all. Demonstrating for“abortion
rights" apparently warranted the
violation of such triﬂing effluvia
as constitutional liberties. Protes-
ters placed theirstickers allover the
windows of the Republican
headquarters (so much for the
inviolability of private property),
andformedahumanchain.denying
the rightofothcrsiocnterandleave
freely. But this is nitpiekingi
obviously there is nothing wrong
with placing the freedoms one
group values over the freedoms of
others, and behaving as though
one’s own are the only freedoms
that matter.

Whatsnuckmeparticularly was
the simplification of all of
Branstad‘s views, as though they
could be broken down neatly into
two-word rubrics, ire. “antir
choice,” “antirgay,” and the most
ridiculous. “anti-environment.”
How can anyone be “antir
environment?” Just because
Branstad doesn’t tow the radical
line on environmental policy, it
hardly means he wants to destroy it.
Bratistad's adminisu'ation this year
has spent 70 percent more on the
environment than last year, But
this fact didn‘t mesh with the
vilification of the governor, and
sincehavingascapegoattodesttise
was more important than the truth.

he still received the stigmaofbeing
“anti-environment.” Evidently, for
those who brandished signs with
environmental slogans, the act of
protesting mattered more than
having a solid reason for it.

Eranstad'sposition VlSeIl-VIS the
death penalty is neither extreme
nor ill»advised. He favors it in
cases in which murder has been
committed in order to prevent
testimony about another felony.
Suppose that a man in Iowa has
committed rape, a felony which, if
he is caught, will consign him to
life in jail. Knowing that no crime
he commits now will incur a worse
sentence than the one he faces
already, the man sees no reason not
to commit murder. Whether he
kills ornot, the woistthatcan happen
to him is to go to prison for life.
Certainly the man isa fool—and he
knows itinot iokitl any witnesses
who could help convict him. If, on
the other hand, the more terrible
crime of murder incurs the
correspondingly more terrible
sentence of death, then he might
well be unwilling to kill.

To watch the question-and
answer session following the
speech, one might have imagined
that Bianstad is directly responsible
for all homelessness in Iowa. and
could make it magically disappear,
butsimplydoesn‘twantto,becausc
he’s evil. Again the homeless have
been cast as helpless victims in a
two-sided morality play. For any
governor,whateverhispoliciesand

views, homelessness is intractable,
a conundrum. especially since for
sornc 44 to 55 percent of the
homeless,almsaremerelysubsidies

Icould nothelpbutwondcrwhat'

was the real impetus of the protest.
Some of the signs around campus
said things such as “Protest of the
year!",“PartoftheGrinnellexperir

“Be hip! Protest Governor Bran-

media that would be present. The
“Be hip!” sign, considering only
thoscfirstiwo words,mightaswell
have been a sign for an all-campus
party. If all the demonstrators were
truly dedicated to the rights in
support of which they protested,
then the presence of news media
shouldn‘t have made any differ
ence. Not if this wasn’tjust a plea
for attention.

Putatively, the event was
intended to make a statement.
PAFA's leader. Rashmi Dyal-
Chand, averted, “This is apcaceful
non-disruptive protest. We want
to show the Iowa voters that
Bransiad is not the right choice."
How? By gathering in a mob and
chanting eight-syllable rhymes in
perpetuity? Thom Main conceded
the “mob mentality“ of the event,

'I‘IIE PROGRESSIVE SIDE

Grinnell in Desperate
Need of Diversity

Grinnell College is almost
uniformly liberal: it looks askance
at conservative politics, and
fervently champions homosexual
rights and feminist action to end
sexism, As an open-minded
individual, I accept and openly
encourage thcadvancementofthcsc
liberaldoctrines. Butwhatdisturbs
me is that, although Grinnell is at
the forefront of homosexual and
feminiSt activism, it is rather
backward in promoting racial
diversity.

Grinnell is far from a melLing
pot—it ﬁrmly maintains an Anglo-
Saxon bent. The College
desperately lacks a heterogeneous
student body, multicultural
education andasubstantial minority
faculty. Grinnell possesses only 98
international students, 60 Afro»
Americans, l9I-Iispanics,52 Asians
and oneNaLiveAmerican. Wehave
no African historian, no Black-
Wn'ter-in»Residence, no Middle
Eastern history, no Latin American
specialist and only eight minority
teachers to boot.

How can a school as liberal as

and a mob, whatever its stated
purpose, is an extremely primitive
form of protest. Nor is shouting
slogans a very articulate and
persuasive form of discourse.
Perhapsthedemonsnatorsexpected
Branstad to come out of the
headquarters, saying, “Okay, I
give up, I‘ll be proechoice now."
Governor Branstad was elected by
Iowa voters who largely agree with
him, and has to respect his
constituency.

As for the results of the protest,
after it was over. several
townspeople who had been
registeredas Democrats entered the
headquarters, expressed disgust at
the way the students had conducted
themselves,andasked to re-register
asRepublicans. Andsomestudents

to form a mob on Fourth Avenue
andpreventtownspeoplephysically
from entering the headquarters, but
it's dishonorable, even in repitsal,
f oranyone in town to deny students
a service they want.

What protesters showed “Iowa
voters," or least the ones who
chanced to learn about this
disgraceful affair, was that some
students,soconcemedaboutcertain
forms of bigotry and “closed-
mindcdncss," lack a modicum of
respect for dissenting views. The

Grinnell lack diversity? I realize
we are in the middle of Iowa, but
the locationdocsn’tmatter. Grinnell
is, and always Will be, a haven for
open-mindedness and tolerance. It
has the political and social
atmosphere that demands a
multiracial presence. Interest
groups such as ASIA, Concemod
Black Students and Students
Organization for Latinos/as,
although under~sized,notonlyhave
been warmly reccivtxl, but have
done a wonderful job ofpromoting
culture on campus as well.
Theadministration now mustdo
its part! Tthollege mustgooutof
its way to recruit a more culturally
diverse student body and must
establish a more multi-ethnic
curriculum. As one of the premier
liberal arts colleges in the country,
we should be at the vangniard of a
multicultural movement.

were prejudiced in the true sense of
the word, as they had judged
Branstad before listening to his
speech. They regarded him with .
more prejudice and dislike than
Iessc Helms has ever brought to
bear in attacking pornography. I
think that before Grinnell students
endeavor to protect free expression
in a museum in Cincinnati, Ohio,
they ought to insure that no one on
this campus meets insults and
physical harassment because of his
or her views.

Just as civil rights activists who
traveled to the South during
segregation faced insults, bitter
contemptand even physical threats,
so those with unpopular views face
intolerance on this and other
“enlightened" campuses. The level
of ”openemindedness" in both
situationsisroughly thesame. This
is not a hyperbolic statement
Considering the death threats and
physical assaults against the Right
that have become endemic to our
colleges, When Adolfo Calcro, the
Contraleader,visitedNonhwestem
University to deliver a speech, the
leftist English professor Barbara
Foley shouted, “He has no right to
speak, He should feel lucky to get
out of here alive." Several years
ago someone threw a molotov
cocktail into the offices of the
Wisconsin BadgereHerald, a
conservative journal at UWI
Madison. These are not isolated
cases, but only a few from a long
and growing list.
