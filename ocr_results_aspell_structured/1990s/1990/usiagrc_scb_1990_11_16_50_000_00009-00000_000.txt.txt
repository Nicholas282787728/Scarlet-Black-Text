Solid Hamlet
Production Opens

By Emily Nchus
and Ryan McNaughton

The Combination or director,
Ellen Mease, and slat, Corrie Z011,
has once again proven magical in
the latest Grinnell Theater produc-
tion of William Shakespeare's
Hamlet.

2011 as the Danish prince carries
off a wonderful performance. He
provides new insight into the con»
volutedmindoftherevcnge-tragcdy
protagonist with a freshness which
is often sadly lacking in Hamlet
productions,

The cast he anchors also iums
in a generally solid perfor-
mancc, Larry Finder’s Claudius
and Dan Sharp's Polonius as well
as Heather May's Ophelia are
all quite excellent. Incredibly.
much more detail than usual has
been applied to comparatively
minor roles, and the nuances in
some of the less well-known
characters’ performances are
stunning. Voltemand, Osric and
the Players are all capable of
stealing their moments from the
main cast, and display a mastery
of verbal and physical expression
which indicates detailed concen-
tration on the parts of both actors
and director.

Not all performances are so
strong; the Ghost of Hamlet‘s
father is almost unnoticeable,

. which-is unfortunate in achar—acter

who should strongly bolster
Hamlet'snerve,andGenrudeseems
a little weak to have incited a
murder. However, the cast ably
adjusts to these relatively small
deficiencies,

"A Traveler‘s

By Sarah Quimby

Perhaps the best way to de-
scribe Mehg HD, Tan’s exhibit in
‘ the Fine Arts building would be
to use his own words: “This recent
introduction to photography does
not urge me to develop a particular
style. aesthetic and otherwise ‘A
Traveler's Diary‘ is perhaps the
best theme for this exhibition.

The collection, a series of 28)
photographs (26black&white,two
color) taken during off-campus
study inGreece, Italy and England,
reﬂects this in that there is no
unifying theme. "the subjectmatter
is diverse, ranging from ocean

Technically, Hamlet is cx~
tremcly ambitious. In the visual
arena, the set, which demands
adaptability to scenes within Lind
neat-a Danish castle, isahalfcircle
of pillars and curtained arches, set
offonleftandrightstdcsby towers,
and fronted with a complex group
of stairs leading in and out of the
pit. The stage has a generally blue
backdrop (though it changes color
to suit the location), and the lighlr
ingcausesasilhouetteeffectwhen-
ever an actor stands at the back of
the stage.

Thecostumcsrange from French
cutaway coaLs and ncttrly classic
robes to modern tuxedos and 20’s
mafia-style suits. Here again, this
production pays great attention to
such details as hats, gloves, sashes
and stripes, which help to delineate
between characters played by the
same actor -- and between various
sides of any particular character's
personality.

Hamlet is also aurally complex.
Audience members may forget
that much of the text is in
iambic pcntameter; even the cou-
plets at the ends of soliliquies
are tastefully performed as
appropriate punctuation rather
than forced endings. Hamlet
contains amassivc number of
lines and even entire speeches
which have reached modern En-
glish-speaking culture as cliches,
proverbs and even song lyrics *
yet the actors, 2011 in particular,
manage to incorporate them
unobtrusively.

The musical score is another
matter. Kevin Zoemig has com-
posed and is performing a score

continuously throughout the entire

chordal and thematic integrity - too

distracting the listener from the

through slow sections, it functions

at its worst as sitcom laugh track,
forcing laughter and other emor

be drawn out more gently by
Shakespeare's phrasing and the
actors’ interpretation.

However, the modem, immedi-
