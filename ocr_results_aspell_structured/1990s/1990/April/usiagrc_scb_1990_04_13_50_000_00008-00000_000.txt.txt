Dancers Play with Traditional Acting
as Pullen Student-Directs Play

By Jennifer Manes

“Very tragic and very
beautiful," says senior
Kirsten Pullen about the
three one act plays she is
directing for an Open
Space'l‘hcaLreProduction
this semester. The“PIays
for Dancers," titled “Al
the Hawk's Well," “The
Only Jealousy oi Emer,"
and“Tho DcaLh ofCuchu~
lain," are a creative inte-
gration of verse by Wil-
liam Butler Yeats with
music and dancing. They
sequentially detail the
heroic saga of Cuchulain,
a legendary ﬁgure derived
from traditional Irish folk-
lore.

Sophomore theatre
majorlicatherMay, com-
mented that the play’s
unique incorporation of
acting, music and dance
has both positive and
negative factors for her.
Since Yeats' verse script
mustbeadheredtosu-ictly
by the actors. they can't
changelines, as is usually
allowedin rehearsal. But
May said that thedancing
segments freed her to
express hercharacter with
“dreamy movements that
you can’t do with purely
realistic forms."

Pullen feels that although her
attendance at the National Theatre
Institute last year was “hell,” it
prepared her for her current direc-
torial project. She has additionally
been theheadol‘GrinnellCollege's
costumeshop for thepast twoyears,

and has participated in several col-
lege productions, as well as a pro-
duction of“A Midsummer Night‘s
Dream" in Des Moines.

The productions set is designed

was composed entirely by senior
Morgan Woodson, who Pullen
