Out of the Closet

By Vlaria McCarthy

H S ome people ill the world
are gay and some aren't, and if
you’re gay, it means you‘ll like
people of the same Sex, and if you
aren't you‘ll like people of the
opposite sex, and if you are don't
worry about it."

It’s as simple as that, according
to an elementary sex cducation
instructor who said those words to
Heather-Jeanne Pyle some eight
years ago.

“I never realized until about the
lOth grade that it (homosexuality)
was something people could get
upset about,” said Pyle. “I just
thought that was how the world
worked. But that’s not how the
world works.”

Coming Out

Lesbian, bisexual, and gay
people (lesbigays) do not have
society’s inherent acceptance of
their sexual preferences. They
usually have to acknowledge that
what they feel is different from
more common images society pore
trays, that the male-female couple
is the norm, that other options are
morally wrong. Such acknowledg-
ment usually is a process. not a one
time event, commonly referred to
as“comingoutof thecloset” within
which these secret feelings are
hidden. The firststepisself-aware-
ness.

”Coming out to yourself means
realizing you have [sexual] feel-
ings for the same sex," said Alanna
Walen, “Some people come out to
themselves, but don't fully accept
it For me coming out to myself
was realizing that I did have feel-
ings, and thatit was okay. Coming
out to yourself means accepting
that you‘re not going to change
that There was nothing I could do
about it"

Coming out requires courage.
Admitting a fact as personal, and
often as feared, as homosexuality
may meet with harsh reactions.

“[Fearing a negative reaction] is
art ingrained thing,” said Todd
Brown. “My fear had nothing to do
with real experience It never hap-
pened to me. Since I was aware of
[my homosexuality] so early, I was
bruialized [emotionally]. so I
learned to keep silent.

"My therapist was the first per»
son I came out to, I thoughtl was
going to tell him, and he was going
to run screaming from the room,
He didn’t. He said, ‘That’s won-
derful. That‘s fabulous. Let’s talk
about it some more.‘ At that point,
thouthwas stillafi'aid,stillpushed
people awtty for safety's sake,"

Throwing away a shield of as»
sumed heterosexuality can be like
throwing away an entire life, and
beginning again. Many people are
simply not comfortable talking

 

openly about sexuality.

"1 would be dreaming about
coming out,“ said April Simmons,
”and I had this whole martyr sce-
nario with April the heroine, I even
thought of going to an all-women’s
college. I thought it would be eas»
ier to come out there."

”It‘s a nerve-wracking process
to come out,“ said Nora Bloch.
"There’s no unawkward way to do
it. It's always awkward.“

Coming out, though, does not
have to be traumatic. It also can
bring a tremendous feeling of re-
lief.

"l was so happy to ﬁnd I had
sexual desires,“ said Pyle. "I just
thought I wasn’t meant for sexual
pleasure. I thoughtsomcthing must
be wrong with me." One of her
friends asked her once, ”Are you
afraid you mi ghtbea lesbian?“ Her
answer was, ”No, I was praying.“

Sometimes, experiences cause a
person to start questioning their
sexuality.

"1 was looking through my par-
ents‘ drawer. I found two maga-
zines, a Playboy and a Playgirli I
told myself, ‘Okay, Todd, which
one are you going to choose?‘ Of
course, I chose the one with the
men in it,“ said Brown.

Bloch first started drinking
about her sexuality during last
year’s Pride Week after she had
participated in the ”22 hours of si-
lence“ activity which “freaked me
outand got me to thinking.“

At other times, self-realiution
may be more gradual.

"i don't remember,“ said Sim-
mons. Gradually, she found her-
self thmkmg, "Hmmm, I think
women are as attractive as men.
Hmmm, something’s wrong with
this scenario. I would feel upright

looking at other
women's bodies.“

One dilemma that
heterosexuals rarely
need to face is the prob
lern of telling other
people about their sex-
ual preferences. Heteror
sexuality is usually as»
sumed unless otherwise
indicated. Lesbigays
often suffer the choice
of melting back into the
atmosphere of the
crowd, ortakingtherisk
of rejection by admit-
ting a difference.

Bloch decided to tell
her close friends.

"I’m a fairly trans-
parent person, and I
can’t deal with leading
two lives. And if they
were my friends, they
woulddeallwithit],and
if they wouldn’t, they
weren't.“

"My closest friends
all knew in high
school,”said Brown "I
really surprised them.
They had really supported each
otherthrough iL lhadonlytoldlwo
people, andof course they told [their
other friends]. Theirreactions were

 

reallyimporiant. How wasan Indie '

aria high school student supposed
to have any resources on how to
deal with a gay friend?“
Sometimes the rockiest step is
telling parents. "Theytookitpretty
well for parents,“ said Walen. "I

thought they didn‘t know till lanu- ‘

ary. I thoughtl had brought every-
thing incriminating with me into
the car, Mom found something, I
don‘t know what, that confirmed
their suspicions thatl was a les-
bian.“

Fear of rejection forces people
to keep silent, but fear of losing
communication with loved ones
often motivates the desire to come
out

"It was getting ridiculous,“ said
Walen, "I couldn't tell them any-
uiingabout it. I’d call them upand
they’d say, ‘What did you do this

weekend?‘ ‘Oh. nothing much.’

Pyle Cﬂmc out to parents in Sep-
tember by mail. "My dad was so
calm about it. I wanted for him to
be able to react in whatever way he
wanted wrlhout having to be supr
poruve right ziwtiy. My parents
keep wanting to say it‘s a phase.
My mom keeps holding onto that;
my dad's being more realistic.“

For Brown it WLIS not so much a
desire buta necessity. "I had to tell
them. I had to. I couldn’t stand it,
I can’t be in the closet. It doesn‘t
function. I can do iton and off, but
Ican'tdo it for more than 10 min-
utes zit it time, I told them by letting
them read Something which is how
I tell a lot of people, My mom
hugged me and cried.“

Stere oty'plng

ome of the confusion and fear
directed towards lesbi gays stems
from misunderstandings or incom-
patible perceptions between people
within and without the non-gay
community.

Problems arise merely from the
labels people use. Bloch feels that
calling herself a lesbian rather than
a bisexual makes a stronger politi»
cal statement because some people
consider that bisexuals are merely
people who have not made up their
minds as to which sex they prefer
more.

”It‘s easier to call myselfa les-
bian. lfeel I'm making more ofa
stand that way. People have this
impression thatbisexuals are wishy»
washy. I‘m not any less a lesbian
because I love men. Becduse lesbi-
anism doesn‘t mean you hate men;
it means you love women.“

"That’s something that upsets
me, that people think that bi is a
copoui. It‘s easier to be an ex-
treme," said Bethe Kizzie. ”You
get benefits from both sides [if
you’re bi], but you also get most of
the disadvantages, too.“

what exactly the term bisexual
means is not as clear as lesbian or
gay. Simmon’s deﬁnition ofbisex-
no] is a person who fzills in love
with "people. not with genitalia.

though I find myself looking for
differentroquircmcnts {crotch and
women.“

"I have friends who call themr
selves bisexuals,“suid Pyle, "who
have equal feelings for men and
women, Lll'ldl feel I’m infringing
on thatiflcallmysclfhisexual. I’m
so much more attracted to women
lhttrt men, like 80/20 or whatever.

“When I first chino [to Grin-
ncll], biscxuals didn't exist. They
were [considered to be] fencevstratlr
tllcrs, and if they (lid exist, [the
attitude was] they shouldn’t be a
part of GLGA (Grinncll Lesbian/
Gay Alliance). I'm really proud
that the community was ﬂexible
enough to change. Fear of bisexu~
alityislike heterophobiaand homo-
phobia combined. I think we need
another word other than bi: it do
fines people only by the sex part."

In other words, the terms hetero»
sexual and homosexual have as their
counterparts lesbian, gay, and
straight. Even the term straight.
which refers to helerosckuals, has
its problems.

“That’s a term that bothers me."
said Kizzie. “It implies crooked or
bent. That‘s like saying anyone
who’s not like me is crooked And
that’s homophobic.”

Scott England prefers the term
struyt. which impliesa snaying from
themeaningof“siraightandproper“
implicit in the term straight.

Sometimes stereotypes, how-
ever, seem applicable.

“Either they’re really ‘bulch' or
really ‘flaming,’ effeminate acting.
like an airhead, with a lot of flam-
boyantgestures,"said England. “A
lot of people havea hard time deal—
ing with them becauseitseemslike
they're trying to fit the stereotypes
created. But there’ll always be
people who ﬁt a stereotype."

Walen Describes Emotion At Realization

By Ann Trdistman

A question often asked of les-
bigays is, "How did you know
and how did you feel when you
realized that you were a gay, bisex-
ual, or lesbian person?"

Alanna Walen described her ex-
perience as a sort of relief that she
did have sexual feelings. She was
bowling with a woman friendwhen
she was about 16. The two began
holding hands in the car, and she
realized that her feelings were real.

"I was utterly terriﬁed, but this

i was something that I knew a man
could never do for me, It was

exciting for me to realize that I
wasn't asexual because I didn't like
boys."

Walen also talked about the im
portance of a gay community:
"When we get together, it confirms
that our way of life is okay."

Walen, an American Studies
major from Illinois, is considering
teaching at the community college
level in the future. With two more
years before graduation, though,
she hasn't made any deﬁnitive
plans. She cited Minneapolis its a
place Where she‘d like to live--
"They have a big lesbian commu»
nity."
