DeLong Classic Off to Successful Start

 

by Gerald Honigstock

Through “blood, sweat and
tears,” to quote the immonal words
of Winston Churchill, nearly 600
athletes competed in the Grinnell/
DeI.ong Track and Field Classic
held last Saturday at the Les Duke
Track. The presence of many of the
top athleles in Division III helped
to make this first meet one of the
very best in the country this year.
Thisscasonot‘trackand ﬁeldisalso
notable because Grinnell teams
have been competing for more than
100 years. LastSaturday, the tradiv
tion continued.

The grandiose prizes lured many
to themcet,butmartyofthoseprizcs
never left Grinttelt. First place
winners received watches, those in
second place a jacket, and for third
a carryall bag. All athletes rcr
eeived caps, so no one left empty-
handed.

One of those whose hands were
full was Amy Retnhart; she had an
excellent set of races, placing 2nd
in both the 100M(12.86) and 200M
(27.01). Another freshman sensa-
tion was Darren Young, who ran
with a vengeance, especially in the
400M to place third in a personal
bestby nearlyasecond (49.18)! He
came back later in the afternoon to
win the 200M (2203). only a frac-
tion of a second from qualifying for
Nationals.

In the High Jump, Abby Green
Lieda personal best to earn 3rd with
ajump of 5’4", Mark Saint»Andre
was also “on" as he ﬂew to new
lengths in the long jumpand placed
second with a personal best of
221.125", Saint-Andre was only
three-quarters of an inch, “a shoe-
lace,” as he termed it, from ﬁrst.

One of the closest races of the

also thelast. Inthe4x800M

relay, Guy Potter received the ba-
ton from Chris Garman before
handingofftoDavidSheridan,who

Lave. After Potter and Sheridan

Lave to run a 1:54 and finish in ’

7:53, one second from the school
record. Garman also ran a strong
Steeplechase in 9:47, a new per
sonal best by no less than nine sce-
ondsl

In the 1500M, Susie Petheram

,

went out at a steady pace only to ‘

pounce on the leader of her heat as
that runner fallered, and wenton to
wrn in a time of 5:17, also a new
best by ten seconds. In the other
heat, JoAnne Saekctt shook off the
cobwehsandmcetitorthel'trsttime
Since the beginning ot‘March. Hcr
time of 5:07 is only a promtsc L
better times ahead

Tltat motto could also apply to

the women's 4x400M relay of
Shannon Swanstrom, Megan
Schukneeht,Annel—Iollislcrand the
redoubtztble Amy Remhart. Their
time of 4:19 is but three seconds
from the school record. The same
goes for the men’sAxlOOM relay of
Matt Schrager, Young, stalwart
Benn Tannenbaum, and Saint-
Andret It all comes down to the
timing of the handoﬂs. and sufﬁce
it to say that both relays are on the
right Lrack.

As Coach Evelyn Freeman ex-
plained it, “Everyone is showing
steady improvement," One should
particularlynotethespecialtyevents
which require constant practice to
finally get to the pointwhere every-
thing is “righL” Schuknecht, for
example, raced many seconds faster
in the 400M hurdles, yet explained
that more improvement is only a
matter of time.
