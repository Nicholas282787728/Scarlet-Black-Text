Complaints Voiced On SPARC'S
Inadequacies to Grinnell Media

By Craig Wacker

Complaints have recently
been heard regarding the
responsiveness of the Student
Publications and Radio Commit-
tee (SPARC). Several Grinncll
College media heads have com-
plained‘ about the committee’s
inability tore‘spond etiicienuy and
effectively to both unique and
everday concoms.

Michael lson. editor in chief of
the Cyclone, complaian primarily
of SPARC's infrequent meetings.
The budgets for various publicar
tions,said Ison,should have aheady
been discussed by the committee.
Also cited by Ison was SPARC’s
lack of contact with the Cyclone.
According to Ison. the laSt time he

wasinvited to attend a meeting of
SPARC was in the third woekofthe
semester. '

Ison also had complaints
about SPARC's head. Christo-
pher Gunst. ison mentioned that it
retrieving the keys to Lhc student
publications building was difﬁcult
since Gunst was slow in approv-
ing the distribution of them. This.
according to Ison. led Jennifer
Erickson. the person responsible
for the keys, to go toWilliam
Deminoff for approval to give
them out. lson added that he had
sent Gunst and SPARC at least a
dozen computer messages on the
matter with no response. Also
indicative of SPARC‘s incompe-
tence. says lson, was the recent
Cyclone request for funds which

had to bypass SPARC completely.
Instead of going to SPARC, the
Cyclone decided to go directly to
SGA.

Kevin Barnett, station manager
of KDIC. also complained about
the lack of SPARC responsive-
ness. Bartlett specifically cited
SPARC's failure to anounce next
semester's available positions.
ThisaccordingtoBametthasmade
the search for next semester's staff
much more difficult.

Doug Cutchins, a member of
the SPARC. said that the commit»
tee had failed in some of its
committments, but that the com-
mittee had time to correct some of
the mistakes made.

bustncsses. Bill Scpic, the head of
Grinncll Chamber of Commerce,

recession.

Breadeaux Pisa. a pizm parlor.
closed three weeks ago. and Coast
to Coast. a hardware store. is in the
process of setting off its inventory.

Both stores are locatcdon Broad

“I don't necessarily think that
the closi s are a result of hard
economic times,“ said Sepic.

Bout of the closings, he axe
plaincd have been caused by other
factors.

Breadeaux's failure occurred
because Grinnell is “close. ifnot at
the saturation point, for pizza
places." Despite ottertng the low-
cst prices for pizza in town.

New Dining
Hall Hours
StillSubject
to Analysis

By Craig Wackcr

Dave McConnell. director of
DiningScrvices,saidthatdatacon-
coming the dining hall hours Wlll
be collected and compiled through
Dec. 14. Itwrllbcanalyzcd during
the holiday recess. Then. accord-
ingloMcConnell,tllehours willbe
retained or changed.

in the interim, the data will be
shared With the Student Govern»
ment Association to get its input.
The goal. added McConnell, is to
have a set of permanent hours by
the next fall semester.

Several types of data are being
collected tojudge the effect of the
new dining hall hours. Among the
items being studied is the number
of days that Cowles dining hall
closes on time, Also important is
the attendance pattern at both loca
tions.

Of special importance is the
4305 pm. period at Quad dining
hall. According to 'McCOnlicll.
more people show up to eat zit that
time titan was previously expected.
Two other subjects at data collec-
lionarcthcbalunceofauendanccat
Quad~Cowlcs compared to lastyear
and the effect of the new hours on
various campus activities.

McConnell mentioned that the
new hours were already providing
some relief to student workers at
Cowlcsdininvhall, Sinccthedining
hall is open tater, students do not
have to keep it open late to

down on the ovcrall time they have
to work. He added that the new
hours prOVldcd ﬂexibility in stu-
dentschedules. Studcntsnow have
a two and a half hour period in
which to have dinner, much larger
than last year's options. according
to McConnell.

The ”early data." said
McConnell, shows that there is
definitely a shift in attendance
patterns between thc two dining
halls. Thenumberorpcople eating

Some problems. according to

cited that the problem of people
who cut in line at Cowlos is a stu-

by the students.
