In Forum

by Craig Wackcr

On Saturday, Nov. 2. on open
forum to addrcss was held the topic
of multiculturalism at Grinncll.
College President George Drake.
Hubert Farbcs, and Dean oancully
Charles Jepsen attended to discuss
the topic,

Drake was the ftrst to Speak,.
highlighting the trouble Grinnell
collcgchasincroatingamulticultural
community. He cited Grinnell‘s
location, its n0n~urban status and
the relative lack of ethnic diversity
in Iowa as barriers to Grinncll's
buildingofanadoquatcmulticultural
community. Drake compared
Grinnell’s battle against these odds
to “swimming upstream." He added
though.thatGrinncllisacommunity
that strives to increase its diversity
in both the faculty and the student
body.

Next to speak was Farbcs, a
member of the Committee for Lt
Stronger Minority Presence. Farbcs
said LhatGrinnclI’sprccmincntmis-
sion is “to provide and assure that
interpersonal and intellectual inter-
courseamong pcoplcofcvcrychtnic,
metal and religious backmund will
pervade the college environment."
Thcuitimatcgoal,saldFarbcs,would
show Grinncll as a place with “uto-
pian clhnic and cultural diversity."

lcpscn emphasized thalan effort
to construct a viable cthnic cbm~ -
munity at Grinncll would have to
come from the administration,
alumni, faculty and students. One
specific goal which Jepsen men—
tioned was the doubling of the mi—
nority faculty in five years. The
ExoeuuveCouneil,saidlepsen,were
especially conccmod with tho into
at Grinncll’s minority faculty.
Icpscn alsocitod thatconﬂicts arose
bctwwn those who supponod di-
vchin in the faculty and those who
wanted maintenance of a classical
liberal arts education.

President Drake thought that the
open fomm was well supported and
attended. Drake stated that among
the consents in the future will for the
distinction botwbcn international
students and those bom in the US.
