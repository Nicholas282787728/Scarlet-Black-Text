Women's Soccer Team Wins
Conference Championship

By Isaac Henderson

The women’s soccer team con-
cluded a fabulous season capturing
the Midwest Conference Champi-
onship by defeating St. Norbens in
the title game 271. By winning the
final game, the young and talented
Pioneer team brought home the its
first championship ever to finish
the season with an impressive 13-
1—1 record including an 8-0 mark
against divisional opponents.

Although the women had
breezed through the southern divir
sion of their conference they faced
a very hot team from St.Norberts.
They had won eight of their last
nine and were playing very good
soccer. Coach ‘fed Eskildscn felt
the key to victory would be “if we
could keep the ball out ofthe hands
of SLNorberts‘ star player Brenda
Beloit." Freshman players Amy
Henderson and Guen Gifford were
assigned to consistently apply
pressure to Beloitand notallow her

to dominatelhegame. BothGifford
and Henderson responded to this
challenge,asEskildsenlaterpt'aised,
took Beloit out of the game and
allowed Grinnell’s offense to score
the necessary goals for the exciting
271 victory.

Grinnell dominated the first half
by outshooting SLNorberts 144,
but Still found themselves tied 1-1
at the end of the half. St. Norberts
scored firstoff across from the left
to take a quick 1-0 lead. Grinnell

Reisdorfalertly inbounded the ball
to a streaking Amy Reinhart who

the tying goal.

The Pioneers came out in the
second halfand continued to apply
pressure totheSLNorberts defense.
After 15 minutes of play Reinhart
was able to break away from her
defenders and score the gorahcad
goal. The Grinnell’s dominating
defense was able to shutdown
SLNorbcrts, which incl udedaspec—

tacular save by goalie Asha Mor»
gan, for the remainder of the game
and claim the championship.

Eskildscn had only praise for his
team after the game. ”the champi-
onship win was a team effort, I am
veryproud. I feel the women played
the bestgameoftheseason."As for
the season as a whole he was “really
happy how the team evolved as a
group"

The Grinnell women’s team
proved time after time that they
were by far the best team in their
conference. Not only did they go
undefeated in conference play, but
they outscordcd their conference
opponents by more than twenty
goals for the whole season. They
did this with a very young team that
consrstcd of many freshman and
sophomores who will return next
season as the team prepares to de-
fend lls conference championship.
If they are able to play at the same
level they maintained this season
this should be an attainable goal.

 

Ultimate Frisbee Team Off to Rough
Start, Drops 3 Games Over Break.

By Bill Hoeman

Grinnell's intercollegiate ultir
mate frisbee team, the
Grinnellephants, has been in exist-
ence for two years. The team has
steadily grown in membership
andskilL Itwill compete this year
as part of the Ultimate Players
Association‘s, not the NCAA.

Recently, the discophytes trav-
eled to Pella. Playing in lightning
and heavy rain against two other

Iowa teams, the U 0“ and the Pella
Eaters, Grinnell lost all three ofits
games,15-9and154103gainstPella
and 15~11 against the U of I.
These losses were due to several
factors. The current team has never
played togetherin competetion, and
several players left for fall break.
In some areas, though. they were
just outplayed. Pella’s quick tran-
sition game sank the ‘Ellephants
offense, and Iowa used a freaky
offense which outfoxed Grinnell.

improve.

The team made an early exitat
College Regionals last year, bow-
ing to Carleton. But more experi-
ence will get this team a lot farther
in the future.
