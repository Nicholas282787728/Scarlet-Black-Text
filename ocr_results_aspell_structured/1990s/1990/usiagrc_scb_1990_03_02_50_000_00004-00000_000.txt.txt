incidents, and focuses largely or
the experience of being Jewish.

What makes a story Jewish?
According to Lieberman, aside
from characters, settings. and
situations, a Jewish story involves
some sort of implicit moral, taking
itbeyond mere entertainment One
favorite example is the Passover
story “The Carp in The Bathtub.“
In the tale, aJewish motherbrings
homealivecarpthat will eventually
become Geﬁlte fish . She keeps it
in the bathtub, but troubles arise
when her little boy does not want
her to kill it.

Leiberman's ‘perforrnancc
style“ includes “becoming the char-
acter”--male or female, young or
old-— through voice and hand move-
ments. Aside from entertainment,
Lieberman sees storytelling as a
way of transmitting wisdom. and
even more, preserving an other-
wise fading cultural heritage _

Lieberman will appear on
Monday night at 7:00 pm. in the
North Lounge of the Forum in a
performance entitled “A Tapestry
of Tales: The World of Jewish
Storytelling."

Speaking for Success:

Forensics Members Qualify for National Contest

by Ann Treistrnan

Grinnell College faced stiff
competition at the University of
Iowa in Ames last weekend. I‘m
not talking about any old athletic
event either. What these people
faced was a different sort of
competitive event, They are a part
of the Grinnell Forensics League.

Seven members of the group
traveledtoArneson Saturday, Feb,
24 to compete in a tournament In
a tournament, students compete
against one another in a variety of
categories all revolving around
speaking ability. For example,
someone reading prose would be
judged on his or her delivery of a
piece of prose chosen by the
speaker. For the extemporaneous
category, the speaker would be
given a topic (usually on some
current event) and allowed 30
minutes to prepare his or her five
minute speech.

The topics for the prose and
poetry categories often deal with
very personal and very emotional
issues. Beth Wodzinski, one of the
original founders of the team,

AIPAC Gives

by Benjamin Root
“t-taving't'he'ra'cts yourself“ was

one of the points stressed at the
Midwest Leadership Training

Seminar given by the American
Isreal Public Affairs Committee
(ALPAC). Five Grinnell students—
Joel Schwartz, Amos Cohen,
Jordan Magill, Debora Block, and
Jesse Messittc—attended the
seminar last Sunday at
Nonhwestem University. >
Schwanz, the Grinnell campus
liason to AIPAC, stressed the
optimism of the seminar as
“instilling that you yourself could
make a difference on a bigger and
bigger settle.” Students from many
Midwestern colleges attended the
seminar which was coordinated in
an effort to motivate pro-Isrml
students in propaganda response
andlocalpolitical activism. AIPAC

competitors tended towards the
more mundane, typical subjects»

but was very emphatic to say that a
majority of the performances
employed real feeling.

prose segment of the competition'
placing sixth in the final round.

Both she and David Karol, who
placed sixth in the impromptu
category. qualiﬁed for theNational
Forensics League competition to

the last week in April.

Blackwell and Karol were the
only members from Grinnell to
place. butJillian Kong emphasized
how well the team did overall, and
pointed outthat, “most new groups
don‘t place. This was
extraordinary."

Wodzinski noted that, “other

teams (came from) schools with
speech departments.” Kong
mentioned that this was only the
team‘s second meet. Shelley West
wmmentedthatmanyofGrinnell's
members didn't have any prior
forensics experience

What can explain the team‘s
success then?

The league began in 1987
through Wodzinski, John
Newmark, andKarol. Itsfustcoach,
Roger Lashley, is responsible for a
lot of the funding that the group
receives. “He deserves a lot of
credit." said Wodzinski. Lashley
had no experience in forensics,and
served mainly as an adviser.

Richard Brightis now theteam's
coach. “It’s a paid position.”
elaborated Wodzinski. “The
adminisuation is behind us."

though, they warned. The ultimate
goal, according to Wodzinski,
Kong, and West, is for the entire
team to make it to nationals.

groups, humanitarian aid, and
military aid to the nation of Isreal
were the issues that Schwartz
mentioned.

Cohen said the conference
showed him how he could make a
difference: “They explained the
hierarchy of politics and how you
have to get involved in even the
smallest campaigns, because these
people move up and do not forget
what they have heard all along...
By going from the general to the
specific they helped us form
opinions and then showed us that
we could use the local level to
immediately affect things in the
US. Every speakerstressod getting
involved in any campaign you can.”

Magill wanted a more diverse
viewpoint of the Middle East
situation , and believes that he got it.
“They showed us a lot of ways of
handling people who do not
understand the situation." he said,
Magill also felt that the seminar
showed the realities of the Arab-
Isreali conﬂict and that there is
negative propaganda about Isreal.

Schwartz agreed, saying that
many people are misinformod and
that propaganda is the cause.
“People from other colleges were
speaking about anti-Isreal
propaganda on their campuses...
[and] thcyjust wanted you to have

AlPAC and the college
chaplains budget subsidized the
students’ trip. Schwttm returned
with the activism that AIPAC
stressed and intends to start a local
chapter of the group Ill Grinncll
