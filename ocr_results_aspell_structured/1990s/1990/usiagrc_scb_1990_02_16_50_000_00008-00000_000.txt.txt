BlackpStudents Dazzle with Talent

By Sharyn Obsatz

The timing could not have
been more perfect. On Saturday,
Feb 10. the night of Grinnell
College’s Black Student Talent
Show, it was announced in
South Africa that Nelson
Mandela, the jailed leader of the
African National Congress,
would be freed the next day. Not
only was the talent show a
celebration of the African-
Ameriean culture and heritage, it
was also a celebration of
Mandela’s freedom after serving
27 years in jail.

The show, presented at 8
pm. to a standingrroom-only
crowd in Robert‘s Theatre, was
hosted by senior Samantha
Massingale and junior Tandeka
Stanback. Comprised of a
variety of dances, songs,
readings. impressions, and skits,
the Show finished with a few
celebratory hymns from South
Africa and the singing of the
South African national anthem~
for which the entire cast united
on stage and the audience rose to
their feet.

Most of the performers were
Grinnell College students, but
several visiting students from
South Africa sang in the ﬁnal
act, and eight junior high and
high school students from the
Alternative Happy Hour Program
in Des Moines. performed two
danecacts.

The purpose of the talent
show, as Slanback explained, was
“to share our culture and heritage

with other people in an informal'

way.” Massingale described the
performance as educational yet
fun, adding, "11’: like PBS in 3-
D."

Each participant in the show
was allowed to choose his or her
own selection, so the messages
expressed varied from act to act.
The aggressive theme of the
opening act. Kiera Henry's dance
to “Fight the Power” by Public
Enemy was contrasted with the
message of interracial unity

presented by John Lopos and
David White in “The John and
Dave Show". White also lip»
synchcd "Respect." while dressed
as Aretha Franklin.

Massingale and Stanback
explained the roots of this
variety within the African-
Amcrican culture, saying,
“We are united by skin color,
but we're still all
unique. Everybody has had
different experiences. In history,
there has never been a
single voice or message
representing the black people.
So many different elements in
society demand different
messages.”

Massingale and Stanback
thought the show was a
great success. They were very
proud of the large turnout and
felt the news of Mandela‘s release
helped to make it a very special
evening.

The youth from Des Moines
who participated also viewed the
experience as a posruve one.

Samctta Hill, 16, said that
being in the show made her
feel good because she “was a
part of Black History Month,
not just sitting around
watching everyone else.” She
felt the show presented the
audience with many messages.
including the idea that, “Blacks
and whites can work together,
black folks can achieve just like
everyone else, and [African
Americans] should know where
their heritage comes fromi
Africa."

Mose Erwin, I4. summed up
his reaction to tile show,
saying.“lt made me feel proud to
bcblackt" -

The Black Student Talent
Show was presented as part
of National Black History
Month, which Massingale and
Stanback described as “a
celebration of black heritage,
culture, history, ideas, and
aspirations."

Many other events are
planned for the month, including
