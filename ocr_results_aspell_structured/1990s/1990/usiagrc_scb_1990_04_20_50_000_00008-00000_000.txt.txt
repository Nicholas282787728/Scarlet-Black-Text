"Romeo, Romeo, Where For Art Thou?"

By Brett Fechhcimer

if Shakespeare had lived in the
New York of the late 50's and had
been as adept a lyricist and chore-
ographeras hewas a playwright, he
might have turned out West Side
Story instead ofaneo andJuiiet
Or atleast that's the opinion of the
artistic force (Leonard Bernstein
and Stephen Sondheim, among
others) behind both this 1961 film
and the hit Broadway musical from
which it was adapted.

West Side Stary is a colorful,
vibrant, shake-your-ztrse musical ,
the kind Hollywood stopped mak-
ing sometime during the Johnson
administration. It takes place in a

raciallyrvolatile neighborhood on
Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

gang and Lhe teis' billet rivals.
When Tony and Maria fall in love,
one need only contemplate
Shakespeare's original work to
realize that tragedy is inevitable.
Despite the somber theme, West
Side Story is packed with rousing
dance sequences, deft lyrics and
youthful, talented acting. These
are the elements which make this

Spielberg Sets a Suspensful Rhythm:

Lounge ’3 PoorAcoustics

By Jennifer Mattes

Many Steven Spielberg ﬁlms
are unﬂawed gems of pure enter-
tainment. You’d have to be com-
pletely and unforgivably jaded not
to appreciate them. Even though
his postrEJ. outputbecame stiltcd
andpretentious.thepure,scintillat—
ing perfection ofhis earlier work is
undeniable, The engaging charac»
Iers.Lhe ﬂuidlopingactioninlawr
and Close Encounters, reaches a
frenzied height of perfection in his
1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark

Harrison Ford creates the daring
and likable persona of Indiana
Jones, Following an explosive
opening sequence in a tangle of
rainforest jungle, during which he
barely escapes a visually colorful
demise, the adventure-seeking
Jones becomes embroiled in a
search for the Ark of the Covenant.

Since the possessor of the ark is
said to be given limitless power,
Jones eventually runs afoul of the
entireNaziregimewhoareseeking
this power.

The pacing of the film is bril-
liant. Hectic, frenzied segments
that violently propel the plot for-
wardareimetspersedwithrelalively
calm interludes during which the
audience can recover its equilib—
rium. Spielberg uses this rhythm to
give his characters space to be
human; theirhumorous nuances of
personality make them identiﬁably
sympathetic

Packed with convention.Raid—

The film is a string of tightly-knit
cliffhanger: that are never post-

All are welcome to these events,

film so fun to watch. One can
tolerate me sappy scenes (and there
are a few) with the knowledge that
Rita Moreno will soon be heating
up a tenement roof-top with her
dancing. In fact, his both wonder-
ful and a bit comical (considering
the current face of urban gangs) to
seethcscdungaroed kidscavortand
leap around their gritty neighbor-
hood. When they dance and sing to
thetunesof such classics ds“AmCrA
ica”and“GceOfficerKrupke",one

Even ifyou’ve already seen West
Side Story fifty times before, why
not give your paper-weary brain a
break and come to be entertained
once again?

Karen Allen plays a particularly
refreshing female lead with gutsy, .
reckless enthusiasm. She is notthe
stereotypical mindless sex object
that requires guidance and protec-

This scene, and the bulk of the
