“Men talking logelhcrﬁil has
everything to do With sexual vior
lenee," said senior Todd Brown,
one of the four participants in the
Men's March Against Rape in
Madison,Wiseonsin last Saturday,

“It was a really big weekend,
lt's hard to describe for me," Said
Brown, "The best part was being
With three other men all weekend,
two gay and two straight; the corn
stant contact was almost (iverr
\vlrclming. It broke down a lot of
barriers [such as] fear of men. I’ve
always been afraid they weregoing
to hurl me or not like me. ThIX
weekend really rcjunvenzitcd my
faith in men,"

Junior Erik Skinner, another
participant, was also overwhelmed
by the impactof“sharittg the week-
end, having conversations, sitting
with each other in a serious discus-
sion,eaiing togcdter. We played in
aplayground,slepttogether,played
cards together.”

The Men's March AgainstRape
was sponsored by the Madison-
bascd group, Men Stopping Rape.
Scott England and Howard
Greenwhieh were the other two
participants‘fro‘rn' Grinnell. ln ‘
addition to the march, the four of
them attended a series of work-
shops. Though some were open to
women and men, the workshops
that the {our attended were desig-
nate/d “men only.“

The first workshop, “Masculin-
ity: How Male Mylhs Hurt Us,"
discussed the dynamics of hetero—
sexual dating,

“1 was moved to see such a large
group of men being open, working
to understand their feelings and
relationships."said Skinner. “I was
disappointed that the workshop
neglected homophobia [because it]
is essential to understanding relar
tionships between menand between
men "m! won‘en."

”I was confused and feltoutside
of the discussion,“ said Brown “It
talked about rape in the context of
heterosexual dating, and I’m not
straight. it was one of the less
relevant issues for me."

The second workshop discussed
“NonrHeroic Methods of Intervenr
tion” or “what we can do to inter-
vene without being stupid," said
'Skinneri ‘ ‘ '

The emphasis was on trusting
gut~level reaction andability to em,
phathize and understand, accord-
ing to Skinner. He does not mean
that one should ignore a person
who is obviously being assaulted.
The methodsdiscussedin the work-
shops,suchasmerelymakingone’s
presence known, applied to situ-

~alions that could potentially turn

into a rapecrisis. He stressed that it
was important to make sure one’s
help is wanted by asking the person
being harassed whether or not s/he
would like intervening action.
The third workshop was entitled
“Bars Between Men: Homopho-
bia." About 30 or 40 inch attended
thi. ast workshop, some of them

survivors of sexual abuse.

“So many of the men were more
scared than we were,” said Brown.
“Three of us sat together, holding
each other. We did a lot for the
good of men. People appreciated
as and told us it was really valu
able."

“I felt we had a positive effect
on the group."

According to Brown and Skin-
ner, the atmosphere was very open.
“It was a really safeplaee forall the
men there,“ said Brown.

”There aren‘t a lot of safe places
for men to share together. It‘s
amazing. Also,lfeltalotofpeople
were dealing with really basic
homophobia: they were dealing
with it for the first Ltme."said Skin~
ner.
and accelerated the pace.”

There was also a rally sponsored
by Men SioppingRape,andaspeak-
out following themareh.

Two of the slogans that moved
Brown and Skinner the most were

“Men can stop rape," and “There :
can be no free men until there are .

free women."

Chinese Dissident

Intellectual

Participates in Panel

By Norma Mendoza—Demon

Last Thursday Grinnell College
was honored to host Binyan Liu,
one ofthe most prominent and out
spoken Chinese dissident intellec-
tuals in exile, and Leo Ou-Fan Lee,
oneofthc diiscountry'stopSinold
gists in a two»part symposium on
contemporary China,

Leo Ou-Faa was the Convoca-
tion speaker, and the title of his talk
was “Cultural Sell-Reﬂection in
PosirMao China."1ti South Lounge
at4:15 ihataftemoon Leo Ou-Fan
Lee, Btnyan, and Professors
Stephanie Hoare and Kang Liu of
Grinnell College partieipaicd in a
panel discussion on “Modern Chi»
nese Literature and Culture."

The discussion revolved around
speculation on the future of China
and its pro-democracy movement.
Blnyan madeanumberefprovoca—

.
tive statements, one of these was .
that within three years there would
be change in the leadership of the ‘
Chinese mainland. This brought .
much discussion from those presV
ent,andIhereweremanyeomments
from the audience and the partici-
pants in praise of Btnyan. “He is
ournational hero,"said Kang, “the
conscience of China."

Binyanalso held a luncheon with
Students from Professor Hsieh’s
Chinese History class. During the
luncheon at the Longhorn, he an-
swered questions and spoke about
his book People or Manners?

The rapid growth and growing
reputation of Grinnell’x Chinese
Studies program is reﬂected in its
ability to attractsuch distinguished
scholars. The fact that students
werecneouragedtomeetinforinally
with these figures indicates that the
program has a personal touch.

Professor Kasimov to
Present Paper

Harold Kasimow. George Drake
Professerof Religious Studies,will
presenta paper on Abraham Joshua
Hesehel‘s book The Prophet: in
Augustattheintemational meeting
of the Society of Biblical Literature
in Vienna, Austria. This work.
which was published in English in
1962, is based on Heschel's doe-
toral dissertation, Die Prophetic ,
written in 1933 for Berlin Univer-
sity.

Professor Kasimow‘s article,
“Abraham Joshua Heschel's Influ-
ence on Contemporary Christian
Theologians," has just been pub-
lished in Japanese by the Japan
Association for Jewish Studies in
Tokyo, This is the first article on
Heschel published in Japanese,

This study explores the profound
and forceful impact that Hesehel

had on a number ofChristian thee»
logians and leaders from various
denominations including Reinhold
Niebuhr, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Daniel Bet-rigan, and Bernhard W.
Anderson.

Although Heschel is not widely
known in Japan, one of the new
religions, the Makuya, which was
founded in 1948, is committed to
the study of his thought.

Kasimow’s article, “Selecting
Textbooks for an Introductory
Course on Jewish Tradition," has
appeared in the Winter 1990 issue
of Sltofar: An Interdisciplinary
Journal of Jewish Studies, This
paperis based on a talk given at the
first meeting of the Midwest Jew~
ish Studies Association.
