 

Peace Day: Why
Do Students
Stay Away?

Saturday was Peace/Eanh Day. An intcmationally renowned.
Nobel Prize nominee delivered the keynote address, guest speakers
hosted workshops onZen meditation, recycling, and homelessness,
and most ofthe campus stayed away.

After three Peace Days, the college should reevaluate the day’s
effectiveness in achieving its goals. Is it a day to be serious and
listen to speakers discuss serious topics, or should it be a chance to
relax before the last weeks of the semester?

Peace Day is a fine concept. Raising student awareness about
global political and environmental issues is a serious and important
cause. But is it too serious a subject for the last weekend in April?

Would a change ofdate make the day more successful? IfPeacc
Day were earlier in the year, we could still deal with the serious
issues, but not at a time of year when the campus needs a stress
release. For proof, we only have to look at the success of
Saturday’s keg race.

Peace Day does not need to be held this late in the year.
Saturday demonstrated that good weatheris not essential to any of
the activities. If it were held earlier in April, or even during broke
up the monotony of February, the campus would be better served.

If this were done, the college could initiate a festival in the
spring that could serve as the stress reliever we students obviously
need. This could be the day to invite bands that are not necessarily
peaceful.

We are not trying to place blame on the Peace Day Committee.
Our point is that, in its current incarnation and time, Peace Day is
flawed and must be reorganized. Right before ﬁnals, students do
not want more lectures.

Guriouser and Curioser
Ignore Campus Propaganda

According to Webster‘s the
definition of propaganda is “Any
systemic, widespread, dissemina-
tion, or promotion of particular
idcas...oflen used disparagingly to
connote deception or disrortion."
That is propaganda. The world of
half truths and selective facts.

Some may be wondering why
I‘vechosentoplaygrammarschool
teacher and give you a definition.
To be honest, I thought that considr
ering all of the talk about truth in
these pages over the last several
months, I could use this, my last
column ofthe year. to speak about
the all too often ignored issue of
propagandaonthiscampus. Ishould
point out that I am not Speaking
about individuals’ political slants;
those are in the realm of opinion.
For example two people might dis-
agree on whether FDR’s domestic
policies had apositive effect in ”'16
long run. Both people, however,
could come to either conclusion
with all the facts at their disposal.

If, however, I were to make the
true statement that most of this
country's major wars in this cen—
tury began under Democratic presi-
dents,andthereforetthepublican
party is more likely to maintain

you to my opinion while denying
you other relevant facts. Such
manipulation of facts has no place
atacollcgcwherepeoplehavecomc
to learn.

Grinnellians, however, seem to
accept propaganda. People here,
forthemostpart,seemunwillingor
unable to refute data which is put
beforethem,whetheritbeconccm-
ing a local, national, or interna-
tional issue. Rather than question
whether they are getting the whole
story they merely accept lhc one
which is popular and well pack-
aged. Wherc is the search for full
information on which to base an
opinion?

There has been a great deal of
propaganda on the local level in the
last several days. For example,
Peace/Eardl day, it seems, upset
enough people that a few of them
decided to publicize their discon-
tent. l’msureyou’vesocn the signs.
They give a $25,000 dollar price
tag to Peace/Earth day and under it
give some cause that the money
should (could?) have been donated
to next to a cracked peace symbol.
Whattheslgnsncglecttosay is that
Peace/Earthdayuself,meaningthc
workshops, the key note speaker,

and thePeaceRibbon in the Forum
cost only $3,700. The rest of the
pricecame, forthe mostpart,outof
Concerts Committee’s Budget,
which had more left over than they
thought. To have not spent the
money would not have made a dif-
fcrence because it simply would
have vanished, which is so often
the case with leftover student con-
trolled money, and Concerts might
of hadadecreased budget next year.
All they were doing was theirjob.
rather than bring more folk singers
to campus for Peace/Earth day, they
brought two bands who's types of
music are rarely heard on this
campus.

But that’s not interesting. There
is 1i ttle propaganda value in people
doing their jobs. It is far more
convenient to lump that large sum
with the smaller budget, and turn
into an emotional appeal. They
used guilt, in an effort to numb you
into not asking questions. Why'
even mention Concerts Commit-
tee? Itisafactbutdoes notwork for
the goal. All they were dotng was
their job: bringing a diversity of
bands lothiscampuswith themoney
they are allotted.

Similar emotional pleas are used
in die abortion issue by boLh sides.

SOVIET UNION. Who would have predicted long
ago that the Communist Party leadership would be
joercd off Lenin’s tomb at a May Day celebration in
Moscow? But many signs of this demonstration were
deeply worrying. First, the strong prevalence of pre-
1917 Imperial flags. Second, the rash of banners
condemning Gorbachev’s reforms and the Soviet
Communists“ increas-
ingly free market and

prospect of a period of
