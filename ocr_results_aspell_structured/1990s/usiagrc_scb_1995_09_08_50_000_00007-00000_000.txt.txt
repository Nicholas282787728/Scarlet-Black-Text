ANY theories have
been created to ex-
plain the decreased

vita ity of the back corner to—
ble in Quad this year. This
legendary table, which last
year played host to a large,
varied, and raucous bond of
role-playing gamers, science ﬁction tans,
user consultants, and people with funny hats,
among others, has otten been quiet and
sparsely populated in the early weeks of this
year. What has happened to Guod’s legend-
ary home of "Find the Bat" and other games,
which was often so full last year that would-
be sitters had to commandeer a second to-
ble?

Well, nearly everyone who sat there
moved to SciFi house, aka. Deep 13, and
makes their own food now.

I recently visited Deep 13, which was
named afterthe base of the mad scientists on
Comedy Central’s cheesy sci—ﬁ spoof/cele-
bration”MysteryScienceTheater 3000.” The
house is located at 1008 Park St, across from
Grinnell House. When I arrived, I discovered
a fairly normal, well-kept house. The only
obvious concessions to its theme were the
Rocky Horror Picture Show posteronthe wall
and the ”Voltran“ coloring books on the cot-
fee table. After all, its residents are science
ﬁction tans, but it's not like every moment of
their life is pervaded by sci—ﬁ—only ”every

other moment,” as iunior Blade Hamilton put it.

The original intention of the house, like that of most
college-owned oft-campus theme houses, was not really
to create a house thoroughly dedicated to its theme, but
just to have a place where a bunch of friends could live
together. The science~ﬁction idea came afterward, be»

WHERE HAS THE BAGK TABLE

SUIENOE EIUTION

HOUSE, THAT S WHERE.

cause a propensity for sci-ti is a common characteristic of
all its residents. Afterthe idea for the house was clariﬁed,
sophomore Janet Borkauskas did all the work otﬁlling out
the applications and talking to Housing, and the group
was granted their abode for this year.

The house serves as the meeting place for Gamers’
Guild, the student group dedicated to strategy, role»ploy-
ing, and other games, and most of the house gathers to
watch TV on nights when shows like "Star Trek: Voyager"
are on. The residents exhibit that classic back table, um,
eccentricity, too: Hamilton keeps a pet can of Spam in a
goldﬁsh bowl in his room, and the freezer is stocked with
a supply ofbanana pop ice cubes. Mmm. Three residents
of the house will be combining this semester to do a Dr.
Demento-style novelty music show on KDIC entitled "Nud-
istColony of the Dead," which will air from noon to 1 pm on
Mondays.

The door of Deep 13 is always open to friends of its
residents,

 

OIlA UALLISON
OEEERS HOUSING
APPLICATION ADVICE

by SARAH STAVETEIG
Features Editor

Rstudents whoore considering living in college
owned housing, Odo Callsion, Grinnell’s Housing
Director, has some advice for you.

"Start organizing early," she says. "The housing
package doesn’t go out until February butthe applica<
tion process doesn't change much from yearto year.
You can ﬁnd out what is necessary by looking at old
copies of the student housing packet.”

She notes that the most common problem in
recentyeors has been students confused about house
preference.

"One ofthingsthatstudents didn't seem to under-
stand last year was that they were applying for a
house. They can give their choices, but there is no
guarantee that they can live in the house they want."

While the housing committee gives preference to
language houses, it does not necessarily give prefer-
ence to project-oriented houses, The competition tor
housing varies from, year to year.

”Some years we have more applications than
houses,” said Callison. ”This year we did not. We also
got two language houses back. We would preferthat
groups applied for a house, rather than let people
draw into one. Then there Is more community in the
house_" - . - ,

There have been many creative applications for ‘
houses in recent history. "There was a multicultural
house last year," said Callison. ”[The students] were
interested in having a multicultural and cross-gender
house. There was also an ettort to have a vegetarian
house this year, but that didn’t work out. But then
again, some really good groups have been the ones
that were just a bunch a friends."

 

 

RED-LIGHT HOUSE INVITES YOU
TO JOIN THEllI NEXT WEEKEND

by DAN MORGAN
Assistant Features Editor

HEN asked to write about Red»Light House, I

half expected the house would parallel the

sinful images of the red-light district of Paris. it
does to some extent, but that isn’t the house's purpose.

Upon arriving atthe house, I was surprised to ﬁnd Red-
Light House to be basicallythemeless. The residents pretty
much agreed that Red-Light House really doesn't have a
theme. Overall, I found the residents of Red-lighthouse to
be more concerned with iust hanging out and having fun
then trying to mold themselves into a speciﬁc theme. In
reality, Red-Light house is iust a bunch of guys with a cool

 

house who like handing out.

The house derives its name from the large red light on the
front porch. According to the residents the house has been
inhabited by Grinnell students for 30 years and it was
probably ﬁrst known as Red-Light House about 10 years
ago. When I asked the guys who live there why they
decided to keep the name Red-Light they told me that it
was due mainlyto tradition and thefactthatwiththe name
Red<Light House and a red light on thetront porch itwas a
pretty easy place to ﬁnd.

Red-Light House invites you to an open house of sorts
next Friday night. ”We're blowin the doors off and pullin out
all the stops,” said iunior Ben Hodgon. Everyone is encour~
aged to visit.
