Living with AIDS

By Daniel Bliss

Three people whose lives have
been deeply impacted by AIDS
spoke here Wednesday night. Bob
Mann. diagnosed HIV positive in
1986. and Matt Charnplan. diag
nosed in 1984, spoke along with
PatHoffmeistcr.whosecousinRick
diedofAIDS relatedcomplications
in October 1990.

Champlan, whose original di—
agnosis was confused with a
spleen problem, had many serious
complications during the ﬁrst three
years. Aseptic ankle roquiredmajor
surgery. and he suffered from en-
ccphditisandmcningitis. Butafter
1987 he madea dramatic recovery.
Although he is still susceptible to
AIDS related conditions. he said
that he is in much better shape.

“For the last two years, I have
not been plagued with pneumonia,
Karposi‘s[satcoma].oranyof those
types of things," he said.

Champlan now does presenta-
tions such as this one to various
audiences throughout the region.
Though he says that he “couldn‘t
imagine doing this 4 or 5 years
ago.” he wanted to emphasize by
his presentations and his recovery
thatan HIV positive diagnosisdoes
not necessarily mean you are
“destined to die."

Champlan also noted the hor-
rendous medical cost of the virus.
He noted that the cost of his eight
month stay in hospital in 1987 was
$867,000. pointing out how fortu»
natchewasthatthis was allcovered
by insurance and govcmmcntbcnr
eﬁts. For him to have a private
policy would cost $500 a month,
more than many pay in a year.

Rob Mann, who had a high fly-
ing design career in Manhattan cut
shortby AIDS. said how difﬁcult it
was to come to terms wtth. He had
“no idea where he picked it up,"
and for the first few months it was
a matter ofself denial, as his health
rapidly deteriorated.

“Dementia set in." he said. “I
would be doing weird things. like
locking myself out of my apartr
merit." His brother Came to New
York and helped to move him back
to his former home state, Iowa,

But for him also, a positive atti-
tude since then has helped to carry
him through. He feltitparticularly
important to emphasize living. not
dying, with the vims.

“Everyonehvtng with this virus
reacts differently and has different
problems," said Mann. “I have had
avcry goodlife,andithasn‘tendcd
yet." The move back to Iowa. howr

 

ever, wasn‘t easy. “My health im-
provodandlsloppedbeingaflake."
But, headded.“Ikeptwanting to go
back home.” It was “like saying
goodbye to an era of my life."

A major shock of being back in
Iowa has been the lack of public
transponation. Butafter three years
of relying on others for mobility.
which he says emphasized his ills
ness. he is buying a Bronco truck.

“Now [lean] get that freedom
and have that independence." said
Mann. “It has been [a battle] to
prove thatIcan takecareofmyself.

. That's whatkoeps us (i.e. HIV
patients) alive."

Mann is now going back to his
hobby and former career “to have a
motive to get up in the morning.“
donating artwork to various AIDS
beneﬁts in the Des Moines area.

BothChamplanandMann noted
theimportanoeofﬁghtingwhatthey
believed was a problem of
sensationaliiau'on of AIDS, espe-
cially the notion that all AIDS pa-
tients are "sickly or emaciated.“

“Matt and I go out and speak
because we want to show people
thatwe can be living with [AIDS]."
said Mann. But he also slated the
impact that the virus has had on his
life nonetheless. “I wouldn't wish
this on anybody," he added.

Hoffmeister noted the detri-
mental effoct homophobia has on
coping with AIDS, especially for
her cousin, most of whose family
did not know that he was gay.

“Atthe time. none ofthe family
members knew about it.“ she said.
“My family did not talk[with Rick]
about the fact that he mightbegay.
..For the first time. our family was
able to openly discuss Rick's ho
mosexuality. It‘s real sad that it
took an illness like this do this."

“Often its a double shock. . the
person comes out to their parents
telling them they have AIDS,“
added Mann.

Hoffmeisteralso mentioned two
other major problems. The first is
the lack ofcare for AIDS patients.
For example, the hospice in Des
Moines which helped Mann and
Champlan to recover from serious
early symptoms or AIDS is now
gone, and there is nothing else like
it in central Iowa.

Furthermore the heterosexual
population is extremely ignorant of
AIDS, carrying on with unsafe
sexual pracuces in spite ofthe fact
that a rapidly increasing share of
new patients are heterosexual.
Doctorshavebcenknown to refrain
from diagnosing AIDS because the
patient is heterosexual. she said.

who was also on the Board. she
brings her extensive experience of
human resource management in the
Intel and Apple corporations.

She said she was especially at-
tracted to Grinnell by the alumni,
who to her suggest “that there is
clearly something very special
here." She added that Grinnellians
seemed particularly motivated by
things other than money,

Bowers noted the state of the
economy and its effect on the en-
dowment. It has fallen by as much
as $70 million over the past year.
although it still remains extremely
high compared to other colleges.
She felt that this was a very good
reason to continue the college‘s
cautious ﬁnancial management

“The minute you start to invade
your endowment. “ said Bowers,

“you start to put yourself at risk
when the times get rough." She
added that ﬁnancial aid was very
imponant. suggesting that Grinnell
will have “to do a signiﬁcant in-
creasein studentaidto maintain the
diversity of the student body."

Bowers also said that it was ime
panant to provide support services
for the “ﬁrst person" of any one
minority to atlend Grinnell. in order
that others may follow.

“If one of your values is diver-

sity, it is going to lake resources to
achieve that.” she added.

She also argued that it was imr
ponantfor thecollegeto state clearly
what it was_all about, saying that
the values of the college. such as
diversity and academic standards.

example of whatthis could achieve.

“I became convinced that it was
absolutely worth doing." said
Bowers. Though itwas notaneasy
task. she said that it had had enor—
mous beneﬁts in making people
feel more included in and better
understanding of the company.

Talking of her appointment. she
saidthara“number ofpeopleleaned

was much encouraged by the vast
improvement in Grinnell‘s cur-
riculum and facilities over the past

help continue that improvement.

Lazier addressed the issue of
increasing campus enrollment.
“There is a widespread consensus
that the student body will not be

He explained that there were two
