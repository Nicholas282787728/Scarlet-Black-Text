In an alrenips so reduce lines,
borh Quad and cowlcs dining halls

Traybreakdown, orTBD, is no

Mosersaid.

The moss dramalic change so

Wooden parsilions now block offshe

liarns said, sludenss can srill sis in

Any sime shey are reserved. he said,

“1 shink it's good shas shey ask

you can never work Dining Services
again," eommenred Fry.

“We’ve made a number ofvery
posisivc changes in she dining halls
for she diner” and for rhe employee
as well, said Cowles manager Barb
Shell.

Shell, Moses, and Williams are

hoping mas shcchangos can alleviase
many of she shortrsiafﬁng problems
Dining services has faced in lhe pass.
(Lass week, before new employees
ssarsed work, Barb Shell could be seen
unloading she dishwasher in Cowlss
kilchen.)

According so Moser, Quad is

shifss are shors swo or shreo people.

Problem meals in cowles, Shell
said, are Tuesday andThursday break»
fasr, and Monday, Wednesday and
Friday lunch. This is due so she schede
uling of freshman susorial and she
number of people who have 1100
classes on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday.

Norshern and Sourhern Ex—
presses have been expanded inro whal
Williams calls "a convenience srore
asmosphere," sludenss can now use
bonus poinss shal come wish lheir

like lhey can do as lhe Forum. The
expresses will also eonsinue serving as

a meal during she day will be able so

value wish cheir meal poinrs.

Exprcss hours have been ex-
panded as well, They will eonsinue

shrough Thursday, bus will also open
from 2 lo 4 in she afrernoon. Sunday
shrough Friday.

Williams said he hopes lhe Ex-
presses will be open lale ners week.

Master Plan introduced, eoninompoeei

T“hey will wans so see lhe sulivan
Bank building and lhey wanl so see
Darby. We couldn’t gel rid ofil bus
is was localed in she wrong place."

According so she Masser plan,
Darby will be moved across Mac Field
so she norrheass corner of Norsh
Campus, freeing up space on ccnslal
campus for a sludenl life sealer and
a new library.

The process would be com.
plesed over she course ofswo weeks,
and would moss likely rake place over
a summer break.

“Having a library on cenlral
campus is very imporsanr," said
Osgood. “and having is and she ssu.
dcns censer in close proximity is
equally imporsans...is has a greas deal

, to do wiih convenience forsrudcnrs,"

Srudens reacsions are diverse,

“Whalscares me is shal we iuss
pur gobs ofmoney inso rhe Fine Arls
cenrer and shal people don’t like ir,”
said iennifer Wheeler, “01. “ll’s nos
designed for whas we need, I don’l
shink we should iuss ssarl shrowing
away all lhar money on more builds
ings."

“There was a mixed reacrion on
many aspecss on she plan," said Bea»
“is was abous haliand half, for

vers.

mg 332 campus network on a uan sys-

sem would make is more reliable.
Miller said shal cccs decided
re use Microsofs Exchange running

" on NT servers for a number of rea-

sons. Microsofl has been increasingly
dominanr in she market, he said, and
mixer schools are now using Microsorr
syssems.

In addition, Grinncll started
using NT servers shree years ago, and
CCCS already knows how to admins
isrer die sysrclns.

Some ssudci-irs have criticized
the NT server’s reliability. Since rl'l:
new iMacs don’t havc disk drives,
barnhars said, “shas means you have
so back up on she NT server, which
has a propensisy so go down, usually
as she worsl possible limes.”

lam weekend, rh: network was
down for abous a day. Laura Harris
'01 said, “[Tlh: cnrirc campus was
wishour access so any ofshe applica.
sions on she server," said Laura Hare
ii: ‘01.

One of she changes
GCCS has been making,
Miller said, is consolidaring
operasions inso swo collie
puscrs, called Ssorageservcr
and Ploncsrscrvcr.

If one server has a
problem, he said, she osher
can take over its services.
Miller said he is srill work-
ing to improve the new sys-
sem. “I’m more slian happy
to try so ﬁeld quesrians,” he
said. Ifsrudcnrs have any
commenls or complainls,
“Just let us know,"

iiiiilaviilmsiiipnliiioru-ianiironyrsiwis

and againsr cenrral dinning

Neverlheless, shere were some
shings sludenss could agree on. “All
she baskesball players wanscd so keep
Darby," she said.

The archisecrs presensed a
somewhat ironic observation: in a
ssase full ofopen areas, Grinncll Col.
lege has less lhan half she acreage of
moss osher liberal arls schools.

The average real eslasc holding
is 190 acres; Grinncll slands on 90.

“There is no ﬁnal solution,”
said Osgood. “It’s someshing so rake
inso considerasion while building.
bus if we, in she fusure, ever gcs a
chance so buy land adjacens so she
campus, we should be desermined so
gel is."

Frank Thomas will be visiring
dorms on campus ssarsing Seplember
lash so salk abous she Masrer Plan
and ges feedback from she sludenss.
Times and locasions will be possed;
all feedback received will be included
in lhe final prescnsasion for theTere
