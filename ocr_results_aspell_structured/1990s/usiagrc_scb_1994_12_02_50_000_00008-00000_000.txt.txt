Women hold ofj’Di/tbuqueforfirsl victory
of season, preparefor Lords and Coe

By DAVE KIDDOO
Sports Editor

F‘I‘ER dropping their first
three games of the season
on the road, the Grinnell

women‘s basketball team won its
home opener Wednesday night, de-
feating the University of Dubuque,
7369. Coach Marti Kingsley called
the Pioneers‘ first wtn of the season
“much needed and wellrdcserved,"
The Pioneers jumped on
Dubuque early in the game, foreing
twcnty ﬁrslrhallturnovers with a V17
CIOUS fullrcourt press. Grinncll ran to
a 46-25 lead at halftime Allreonferr
enee guard Dncey Waldron had five
of her SIX steals in the first half.
After the break, however,
Dubuque started to chip away at the
lead. However. they would conic no
closer than the ﬁnal inarwin of four
pOmIS Ofthc second hall. Kingsley
said, “i think the biggest difference
between the halves was the way that
Dubuque played. They got really
physical in thesecond half. Also, we
got tired. We wanted to stay aggrese
site through thewhole game, and we

I did."

Sophomore Steph Walters and
Waldron both played all 40 minutes
of the game and each poured in 21
points. SophonioreLaraCzajkowski
scored eleven points, while junior
cercaptain Kari Hallett added ten.
Walters, Hallett and CzaJkowski

grabbed eight rebounds each. .luttior
guard Sara Sclioen added ten assists
and eight points, Kingsley stressed
theimpomnccofSchoen to thcteant
by saying “Schoen fouled out, and
ourleaddisappeared. Weneedherin
the game."

Overall, Kingsley was pleased
with hertcam's performance. “What
we did tonight shows that we’re
steadily improving. We had a ten—
point lead down the stretch, and they
hit a couple of late thrcCrpomtcrs to
cut the lead down, but we played
well. We attacked more on offensc,
and our press took them out oftheie
offense."

Kingsley praised the play of the
wholeteamonoffeiise,saying,“5ieph
[Walters] and Daeey [Waldron] had
a great shooting night, but we adr
justcd well when they started to pres-
sure us on the perimeter and we went
inside. We got a big game from our
post players. even though we were
presstng,”

The Pioneers have two more
home games before winter Break.
They will face Loras tomorrow after-
noon at 3:30 pm, and then will face
Coe Tuesday night. According to
Kingsley, “Loias is a very intense
team. We‘ll have to handle their
press, and that will help prepare us
for Coe. Coe IS the team we really
want to beat, and we’re aiming for
them.” Both home games will be
played in Darby Gym.
