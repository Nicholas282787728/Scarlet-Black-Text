Molsberry wants to heal IS own ang_r

Pastor urges hit-and—run
driver: confess, be forgiven

AGrinnell pastorpartiallyparaiyzed
after being stmck by a pickup truck
while bicycling east of Grinnell in
May 1997 wants the hit-and-run driver
to confess and be forgiven.

The Rev. Bob Molsbei-iy, pastor or
the Gnnnell United Church of Christ
—Congregational, writes in a letterto
the editorofThe Grinncll HeraldrRegr
ister that, in order for him to achieve
maximum recovery, he needs to for-
give the driver. For now, Molsberry
remains angry, he states. But he also
asks whether driver also is “in need of
some healing."

Letters to the editor normally ap»
pear on The HeraldrRegister‘s Opine
ion page. Because of the extraordinary
nature of this letter, however, it is
being printed on the front page.

Here is the text of Molsberry‘s letr
ter:

I

I address myself to the person dnv-
ing the dark pickup truck which hit me
lastMay 31 while 1 was bicycling east
of Grinnell on Highway 6.

I wantyouto knowthatyou changed

 

 

 

 

 

Why was it that Around had this
uneasy feeling of expectation all day
Wednesday, as though something
should be happening but wasn‘t?

Was it because it was April 1, April
Fool‘s Day, and somebody was sup-
posedto fool someone else but didn’t?

Where were all the foolers? Never
was there an April Fool’s Day in
Around’s childhood but what some-
oneput salt in thesugarbowl forbreak-
fast. it was unbroken nile, one that
everyone expected but no one ever let
on.

So maybe tomfoolery is out the win-
dow, which is a real shame.Ha_ve all
our “worries“ made us so serious that
we don’t have time to be silly? And this
in a day and age that the economy in
our country supposedly is so booming
that no one needs to have economic
worries? Can it be that that kind of
assurance makes us take ourselves too
seriously?

Anyway, Around has given up for
this year. Maybe next April Fool’s Day
will be different.

A picture on the front page of the
Thursday issue ofthe Herald-Register
(last Friday’s 3&3 edition) contains

an anomaly that requires explanation. '

Right there in the front row is a
picture of Tom Lannom holding an
infant who, given his age, obviously
cannot be a member ofthe 1998 Town
and Gown campaign for Gnnnell Col-
lege.

Tums out the infant, Ross Raubcr,
was a hand—off. His mother, Margaret

Rauber, an associate and photographer_

in the college’s public relations de-
partment who was taking the picture,
didn‘t have enough hands to hold the
baby and snap the picture at the same
time so she asked someone to hold
him. And who should willingly volun-
teer but Lannom.

Thepicture has its own signiﬁcance,
according to M] Zinunerman, chair—
person of this year's drive, because
Ross is pointing up which is the way
she wants the drive to go.

Reigning Mystery Object

Floyd Barr of Kellogg has more in-
sights into the reigning Mystery 0b-
ject, refemng to it also as an alter fora
stationaryenginethathckncw 60 years
ago when his dad Sam Barr had one
thathc usedon thccngine forawashing
machineanda littlecom grinder, which
ﬁts right in with what Byion‘Worlcy
said when he submitted it.

Ellery Vcn-nane who lives northeast
ot'HartWick also relates to the Mystery
Objectbut he wishes that we had shown
it right side up (oopsl). it‘s an oil cup
for older gas engines, he says. His
father had a gas engine that was
mounted With a wood saw and had an
oil cup like this. The stem could be
turned down to shut offthe oil the when
the motor is shut off, You could see
through the neck to tell how much oil to
drip, so many drops per minute, he
says. The top and bottom are brass.
This was the only way that the cylinder
could be oiled, as oil ran from the oil
cupthrough a tube down to the cylinder
and the tube ran through the water
basin that cooled the engine, Oil cups
also were used on oldrstyle single-
cylinderaircomptessors, headds. Such
oil cups date back to the late 19205 and
early 1930s. in other words, they are
the stuffof history!

Will college
name new
president soOn?

The Grinnell College Presidential
Search Committee has been sifting
through some 250 names of persons
who have applied or been nominated
to succeed Pamela Ferguson and be-
come the college’s 12th president.

Richard Ridgway, the college's di-
rcctorofpublicrelations,saidTuesday
that the committee hopes to make a
recommendation to the full board of
trustees by mid-May.

That means it’s still possible a succes—
sor to Ferguson will be announced prior

to this year's commencement exercises, .

which are scheduled for May 18.
“The trustees’ meeting is scheduled for
the 14th and 15th ofMay," Ridgway said.
Caroline Little, who is chairing the
Presidential Search Committee, prOr
vided an update March 27 on the trust—

,ees’ website.

Little said the committee has in
terviewed candidates during two long
weekends in Chicago and plans to in
terview more,

During April, several of the can-
didates are expected to visit the Grin-
nell campus to become better ac-
quaintcd with Grinnell and to give
college students, faculty and staff a
chance to meet with the candidates.

Ferguson resigned unexpectedly in
October. Charles Duke, former dean
of the college, is sewing as interim
president.

Ten retailers charged
with illegal beer sales

Ten Poweshiek County retailers face
charges of selling beer to minors,
thanks to a sting conducted by the
Poweshiek County Sheriff’s Ofﬁce.

Thesheriffsdepartmentscntminots
to various establishments in an effort to
determine whether the retailers would
ask for identiﬁcation to prove that she
was old enough to by beer.

While 15 ofthe clerks at those busi-
nesses did card the young woman, 10
didnot,andthey‘venowbeenchargcd.

DeputyTomSheetssaidthcshcriff’s
ofﬁce had received complaints that
some underage people had been buy—
ing alcohol without difﬁculty at some
locations, so the department decided
to put those allegations to a test at
locations throughout the county.

As a result, these businesses have
been charged with selling beer to mi-
nors: Casey's General Store West,
Kum & Go and Coastal Mart, all of
Grinnell;BrooklynSchIceCenterand
Kum & Go, both ofBrooklyn; Pronto,
Katwood Komer and Seaton‘s Jack &

Jill, all ofVIctor; and Casey‘s General
Store and Break Pointe Store, both of
Montezuma.

In the Victor area, all of the es-
tablishment tested were charged, al-
legcdly having failed to card the un-
derage buyer.

Both the establishments themselves
and the individual clerks who sold the
beer without asking for ID have been
charged. Under Iowa law, selling beer
to a minor is a serious misdemeanor
that carries a maximum penalty of a
$1,500 ﬁne.

Sheets said that the minors used in
the sting had instructions to present
their own, legitimate IDs if requested.
Thoseidentiﬁcations showedthatthey
were underage.

Authorities also used a concealed
microphone to record what was said
when the minor attempted to make a
beer purchase.

A follow-up sting operation is ex-
pected to occur sometime this summer.

Has the ofﬁce oftlte spcclal prosecutor evolved into the office ofthe special
persecutor? lt's'an argument that can be made, given news that Kenneth Starr
now is seeking the rccoids ofa Washington, D.C,, book store in an effort to
determine what purchases have been made by Monica Lewinsky.

There is, of conrsc, a reason behind Starr‘s licavy-handedness: He wants to
determine whether Lcwinsky, who has alternately claimed and denied a
sexual liaison with President Clinton, purchased a book at the store and gave
it to the prestdent as a gift, Tile book in question is “Vox,” a literate, if
raunchy, novel by Nicholson Baker that is based on phone-sex conversations.
Did Lewinsky give Clinton a copy? Did he read it? That appears to be Starr's
interest In rummaging through sales records to determine what the former
White House intcm's literary tastes might be.

There l‘asn’t been all that much reported about this particular facet ofthe
Starr investigation, mainly because it’s been overshadowed by news that a
federal judge in Arkansas has tossed out the lawsuit ﬁled against the president

by Paula Jones. Had the Jones
news not eclipsed the book store
item, the latter probably would
have gotten more ink and air time.
As ills, more attention is now
being paid to the subpoena ofthe
D.C. store's records, as well it
should.

Apparently it’s all legal,
although many Americans would raise First and Fourth Amendment ques-
tions. The icbuttal, of Course, is that Starr is trying to uncover evidence that
Lewinsky and/or the president might be guilty ofobstruction of justice or
some other offense, and that records ofa book purchase might provide some
sort of link to such a charge.

Maybe it’s not illegal search and seizure, but we can't think ofmany
people who wouldn‘t ﬁnd an inquiry both distasteful and offensive lfit
involved their own records. It makes no difference ifa person‘s book
purchases 7 or video rentals, cornputcr records or anything else 7 are
innocuous or rcvcal exotic tastes, Those things are, quite simply, no one
elsc's busmess. At least they shouldn't be.

There‘s lots oftalk now thut Starr is under increasing pressure to wrap up
his investigation. and that the dismissal ofthe Jones case destroys an
important link to his investigation. Mnybc, maybe not. But there is growing
evidence that the independent counsel is canying his probe to extremes that
are unseemly and chilling.

Most Americans, no matter what their politics, would be outraged iftheir
own records were the targets ofsuch a probe. We‘d even go so far as to suggest
that Starr himselfwonld be among them ifhe were on the receiving end.
