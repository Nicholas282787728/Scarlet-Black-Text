Drummers, Orchestra Among
Concerts Planned by CPE

By Riva Sharples

HIS school year,GrinnellCol

I lege students have the oppor
tunity to experience a wide

range of dramatic and musical per-
formances from across the United
States and around the world, thanks
to the Committee for Public Events.

Thecommitteeissponsoringfive
events this year, the ﬁrst of which
takes place this Tuesday with a per-
formance by NEXUS, a percussion
quintet from Toronto (see
Hombuckle’s anicle).

“After NEXUS, we are also go-
ing to have two stageprcsentations, a
chamber orchestra performance, and
arecim byadistinguishcd American
pianist," said committee Chairman
Don Smith. “It should be pretty ex-
citing."

In October,thecommitteebrings
the Suk Chamber Orchestra to
Grinnell. The event is planned in
conjunction with the centenary come
memoration of Antonin Dvorak‘s
residency in Iowa in 1893.

During the second semester,
Stewart Copeland and the
Rhythmatists. a group of drummers
who perform “beats from African,
Brazilian, and Native American cul-
tures,” will take the stage. Commit-
teersponsored performances by the
National Theatre of the Deaf and by
Pianist Gilbert Kalish are also
planned.

Smith believes that the sponr
sored activiucsarecrucialtothewell-

being ofthe college and community.

‘Throughour‘committee, people
see and hear cultural events genera
ated from within and also from out-
side. I‘m sure many students have
developed, as a result of going to our
concerts, a taste for good music and
drama, and although they don’t know
it, are indebted to the committee.”

To pay fortlieperformanccs, the
committeeis alloted money from the
general college fund and from stur
dent activities fees. This year's bud»
get is $40,000 and the seven-mem ber
committee, made up of four faculty
members and three students, is pres-
cntly investigating possiblities for
next year.

“Right now, we’re just in the
beginningstage,"saidSmiih. ”We've
listened to one CD and a couple of
tapes, but. we haven’t made any deci-
sions yet. We‘re constantly receiv-
ing materials from agents and there’s
a lot to sort through.“

The committee hopes to put to
gether a balanced program of music
and theater (including dance and op-
eras) for next year, said Smith.

“We want to have a nice bal—
ance. We might go for less perforr
mances next year, weighing quality
against quantity. Of course, we at-
ways welcome suggestions froin 5w.
dents. In fact, I remember many
years ago, one singer came here di-
rectly as a result ofstudentrequests.”

The committee hopes to fin-
ish selecting next year’s agenda
by May 1.

that interests us, then it can be used in
a perfonntince.”

While in Grinnell, NEXUS Will
be involved in numerous events
throughout the day. The ﬁrsl sched-
uled event is a morning workshop in
Herrick Chapel, The workshop Will
begin at 10:00 am. with a mallet in-
slrumentclinic sponsored by Kori Pcr-
cussion, followed by the NEXUS
workshop at 10:30 a.m. The NEXUS
workshop will feature tips on the sc-
leetion and performance of percussmn
works.

NEXUS will perform atS:OOp.m,
in Herrick Chapel. They hope to in Iro-
duoe a broad and colorful range of
instruments and music to the campus
in an entenaining style. Following the
concert, the members ofNEXUS will
be available to talk with the public in
the South Lounge of the Fonim.

Recognized as one of Canada‘s
premiere chamber groups and one of
the foremost percussion ensembles in
the world, NEXUS is composed of
ﬁve classically trained musicians who
felt dissatisﬁed as orchesu-al percus-
sionisls. Russell Hartenberger, Robin
Engleman, John Wyre, Bob Becker
and William Cahn formed NEXUS in
1971 to expand their musical activi-
ties, and have toured around the world
to study music and instruments. The
group perfonns a wide variety of mu—
sic that includes early 20th century
xylophone ragtime music and group
improvisations.
