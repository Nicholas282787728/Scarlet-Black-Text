Dear leZ,

I’m having problems being “hip"
and “cool” lately. I try to buy the
latest in fashions and keep up with
trends I see in magazines, but they
never seem to make up for [lie fact
that I'm ugly. I started reading stuff
like Spin and watching MTV so I
know what's up In the music world.
ﬁguring I could pass as an alterna
chick, but no one seems to like my
Fiona Apple-inspired style. I even
started using heroin to get that chic
thing down, but that doesn’t work
either. How can I stay at the leading
edge without falling off?

Columnist

Janie likes the bass player cause of
how he makes her move, Charlie
likes the way Janie moves, the free
dom of her hips, the up and down of
her chest. Janle‘s got her eyes closed
and her mind focused on the bass.
She is unaware of Charlie and his
probing eyes,

Janie moves naturally. Charlie loves
her natural beauty. I-Iis focused cycs
don‘t stray. They are glued to her,
following her rhythm, anticipating
her Steps. He smiles in delight when
his mind moves with her body, it is
as though he is inside her, moving
with her as she glides and bounces,
raging beneath the red lights, the
lights which shine along the streaks
of her hair.

BY ERIN PETERSEN
& REBECCA EILERS
Food Critics

Oh, the glory. Nothing could keep
us away front the Grand Opening of
the Northern Express, Wc had been
planning our schedules around the
impending fcstivlly for weeks and at
last, the time had arrived to board the
train. Our fearless conductor, Dave
McConnell, along with his trusty
porters, Barb arid Jeanette, were there
reltdy to answer our thought-provok—
ing questions such as “Why 23
points?" (This will remain an Unr
solved Mystery. Dave, In all his un-
fettered wisdom, could not clearly
explain to us WHY 23 was the prime
number ofchoice )After picking up
two point sheets, which would serve
as our tickets to the dining car, we
got in a very very very long line. In
fact, we are convinced that all 170
people who attended the Grand
Opening were in line ahead of us,
However, we needed the extra time
in line to circle our food choices (In
fact, Erin needed to got five more
tickets since she ravaged the first
four, Rebecca, being the anal perfec-

tionist that she is, needed only one.
Goody for her)

Brown bags in hand, we headed to
Younket with adining tip from Dave:
"I suggest you put warm water in the
H: dehydrated soup," We did not ﬁnd
this advrce insipid. Rebecca finally
convinced Erin that Dave was prob-
ably correcl; cold water‘would be a
less successful option. So, we settled
in the second ﬂoor kitchen, only to
discover two people engaged in face
suckage, This did not deter us from
our mission, although it did distract
us brieﬂy on our multiple trips to the
microwave.

On the first trip to nuke the micro-
wave pizza (which comes in two
potentially mind-blowing flavors,
pepperoni and supreeeeeeme), we
discovered the importance ofplates.
Our advice: use them. Erin pointed
out that the Little Charlie‘s individual
meat pizza had the approximate con-
sistency of sour cream, In the words
of Rebecca, an English major, “it's
just kinda, you know,
more..,blk.hahah." On the other hand,
Erin did enjoy the pepperoni, noting
brightly, “Mmmm. Meat,"

Citra, a frosty, fruity carbonated

OPINION

beverage, was by far the highlight of
our mid-evening snack. This was
perhaps only because II was some-
thing refreshing with which to wash
down some condiment-less food,
such as the bl bean burger, (We are
not sure What “bl" stands for.) We
found that the blarney bean burger,
much like gasoline or incense, had
an appetizing small but had a some
what horrible taste. (Not that either
ofus have tasted gasoline or incense.
At least not while we were sober.)
Again, we would like to stress that
this problem may have been due to
the fact that neither of us received
ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish,
dijon, tartar sauce, ranch dressing,
soy sauce, or any other condiment as
per our request. In the words of
Hanson, the ﬁnest musical trio ofall
time, Erin asks, “Where‘s the Love?"
We also concede that blkhahah bean
burgers might actually be tasty for
those who don’t enjoy consuming
animal carcasses . We, however, ﬁnd
anything without meat, including
cereal, to be pointless.

This brings us to the Golden
Grahams dilemma. Hellooooooo.
They offer to give us spoons, knives,

5

forks, and napkins (although they
seemed to have forgotten to include
them in OUR brown bags,
BitterzUs), but NO bowls! This is a
travesty. Thus, Erin, at Rebecca’s
command, sliced open the box side-
ways in a bowl-like fashion, with her
BRAND NEW EDDIE BAUER
VICTORINOX SWISS CARD,
nearly severing several ﬁngers in the
process. (For the painfully ignorant
masses, the Swiss Card is one ofthe
finest inventions of all time, next to
the nutty bar and Hanson. It includes
many outstanding features such as a
handy three-inch ruler and a tooth»
pick in a convenient credit card size
package.) But since Erin didn’t feel
like eating her cereal with milk, she
didn’t really even need a bowl, So
she hacked open the box only for the
sheer joy ofutilizing the Swiss Card.
We concluded the evening with sev-
eral loud, obnoxious burps, mostly
due to the Citra. Said Rebecca after
one particularly richter-scale-like
oral explosion, “Now THAT’S the
burp of a satisﬁed woman." This was
true. Also, it was not insipid.

Take heed, Dave, We’ll be back.

 

Letters

To Disco enthusiasts everywhere,

Once again it is time for the Men
Who Stuff Their Crotches to come
together and brainstorm an idea to
promote our lovely dance in the Scar-
let and Black. While we realize these
letters are often a stretch, we are
dancers, groovers and shakers, not
writcrs, As a good Grinnell student,
please endure our semi-creative
babbleas we try to sell youourdance
in a sick and twisted version of Su-
permarket Sweep. Here are the items
you Will need to have a successful
Disco:

1, Platform shoeSr Not only are they
stylish but they will keep you dry
above the inch or so lake of Brut and
beer that forms on the Harris center
ﬂoor.

2, Tight pants » Stuffed crotches look
better this way,

3. Brut (and lots of it) - While you
are likely to get doused with it when
you get to Harris, it makes you an
instant hit at the prerDisCo parties
and smells a lot better than that bud-
get soap you try to pass off as de-
odorant.

A. Cucumber (more for the guys but
we‘re not stopping any of you
women who have the inclination) .
A Di'sco tradition that ﬁts surprise
ingly well into tight pants.

5, Official Disco T-Shrrt , Soon to
be on sale at a dining hall near you,
these inexpensive masterpieces (de
signed by artist extraordinaire Dave
Lukowski) are great to wear under
itchy polyester suits to keep your
nipples from chafing.

6 Monkey (live or stuffed, preferr
ably stuffed for safety’s sake) , While
(to our knowledge) no one has ever
brought a monkey to Disco, they are
cute, fuzzy and hey, who doesn't like
monkeys?

7. Iron liver - Whtle this item is
harder to find at the local WalrMart.
your body will thank you the day
after for the added protection.

8 Depends adult diapers - This item
is optional but it sure is great to dance
for four hours without missing abeat
of the action packed experience that
is Disco.

While improvisation is a key to the
diversity and enjoyment of Disco, we
believe these items will greatly en-
hance your Disco experience. Beer
goggles will be provrded at the time
of Disco but are to be used at your
own pcni Good shopping and we
look forward to seeing you. Disco

To the Campus Community:

The HUB festival last Saturday
night made for an exceptional and
entertaining evening on campus, We
would like to thank all the students
who participated in HUB: The orga-
nizers and managers of Bob‘s, who
initiated an acoustic gathering, the
musicians who brought the crowd
together through impressive sound
and song, and the student supporters
who comprised the overﬂowing au-
dience. We believe that HUB is the
most recent and effective example of
a gathering of active campus bands,
and we are glad to see the wrdt: slue
dent support for this performance.
We hope that the opportunity for die
verse campus musicians to perform

will expand with the increased ac»
cessibility of musical venues on came
pus. Similarly, we hope that the sup-
port for musical diversity on campus,
for the collectivity of student talent
and for student participation in the
ﬁne arts will increase in pragmatic
ways which will inevitably improve
student life on Grinnell’s campus.
Consistent exposure to, and partici-
pation in. good programs in the arts
improves our quality of life. The arts
instill us with satisfying doses ofjoy,
anger, and sorrow, they enlighten us
to life’s complexities and contradic-
tions. and they comfortingly remind
us that we are not alone. Within our
college, the arts provide chances to
understand and bond with others in
our community, and to express our-
selves to our peers, chances we may
not otherwise have in the hustle and
bustle of daily classes, meetings,
jobs, and study sessions. M

broadly, the arts give humanity a way i
to become more profoundly aware of
the World we live in.

In the years we have attended
Grinnell, no other examples of such
resounding support for a musical
event produced and performed by
students stands out in our minds This
is why we feel it is so important to
thank all those involved with the
HUB festival for producing a great
show on Saturday night. HUB is just
one example of a productive and
positive artistic group, but our cam—
pus provides many opportunities for
student involvement in the arts. We
hope I-IUB inspires each and every
one of these organizations to remain
active and to excel.

Sincerely.
