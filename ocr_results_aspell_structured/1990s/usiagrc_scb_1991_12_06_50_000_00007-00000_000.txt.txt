DINOSAUR DAYS
B.A.= Bad Attitude ?

Betcha can’t wait to tell all your
relatives what you plan to do with
your future. Seniors especially look
forward to winter break for this gem
ofan opportunity. My AuntMartha is
very excitedthatl’ve attended one of
the finest institutions in this country.
She never hesitates to mention “that
expensive private school you have to
go to— where is it? Idaho? Your poor
parents must be thrilled that you're
almost done. All that money...and
now what?" Sometimes I wish that
I‘d learned how to be a plumber. We
could talk about clogged drains and
the new hot tub that the Jones’ down
the road were putting in.

No, not really. I suppose that it
isn’ttoomuchtoendurc:threeorfour
days of perpetual guilt to make my
mother happy. Besides, I’m primed
for the questions. Last weekend] was
out walking and wound up chatting
with a white—haired man for about a
mile. He asked what] was doing and
I told him about Grinnell.

“So, you‘re a college student?”
The man stopped for a minute and
looked me up and down. I was not
dressed as stylishly as he; I don’t
think thatI would wear hot pink run-
ning pants edged in electric blue and
emblazoned with the Bill Rodgers
mnning logo even if someone gave
meapair. It wasonlymysecond visit
to Chicago, but I suspected that the

Ann
Treistman

outfitwas notcxemplary of the urban
walking scene. Ofcourse neither was
my long underwear/sweatshirt look.
Still, I was surprised that he hadn't
assumed that I was a student.

“A senior,” I told him.

“What’re you goingto get? What’s
your major?"

“A bachelor’s degree in English.”
I waited forthe next; the inevitable. I
sorted through my various “after
graduation"stories.ShouldIgivehim
graduate school? A job in publish—
ing? Perhapshe’dgetakickoutofthe
manageratea-fast-food—chain-whlle»
I-write-on»thc-side.

Before I’d even gone through the
list, he snorted: “A B.A.7 Hmph. My
grandson got his B.A. What good did
itdo him? Bad Attitude, that's what it
ought to stand for."

“What?" He‘d stopped walking
and shook his list Skyward,

“Bad Attitude. Suddenly Jimmy’s
an expert on everything. Those dang
liberal arts. When I went to school, I
learned how to fix cars. Period. I immy
comes home and he criticizes the
newspaper. The layout is all wrong,
he tells me. I’ve been getting that
paper for 30 years and he tells me

that.“

“Maybe he‘s into journalism,” I
offered, sticking up for (I assumed) a
fellow writer.

“Naw.Nothing‘sgoodenoughfor
him, And when I tell him to change
something that he’s complaining
about, he says that he‘s too busy or
that there's no point anyway.”

While I tried to think of a re»
sponse, I remembered all the things
thatl‘vccomplainedabout.So.maybe
I have wondered about the different
fonts on the New York Times from
page.AndIdowhineaboutmySpan-
ish class. And the stupidity of the
country. And holiday commercial-
ism.

“Gettingadegreemakesyoumore
aware of things?" I u-ied, my voice
rising in a question.

“If that's what you call having an
attitude," he sighed.

We‘d gone around the lake once. I
thought about David Ressner, the
column due at the endof the week and
the holidays with my relatives loom-
ing ahead. When they ask what I'm
doing, I’m going to tell them some-
thing good. Something beyond com-
plaintsandexcuses.Becauseifyou're
going to have an attitude, you might
as well take advantage of it. Use it:
DO SOMETHING.

THE REAL WORLD

Come on baby,

It was such a strange thing to read
thatIliterallylookedaway,shookmy
head once to hopefully knock my
brains back into place, and looked
back. To my astonishment. the quote
remained, glaring back at me in the
full glory of its computervprint clar-
ity.

“In lightofrecent fire problems. a
proposal is being considered which
wouldbancandles from dorm rooms.”

Ah,whatglorious heightsofinan-
ity the minds of administrators can
achieve! Candles? Why, God, why'.7

You could put any student. even
me, in a dorm room with 8000 of
thosefully-wickedcylindricalmmscs
of wax, say “Go nuts!" and shut the
door and absolutely nothing would
happen. Nothing, that is, unless that
aforementioned student happened to
have access to a Bic lighter or a book
of matches. or at least two decent-
sized sticks to rub together. a la the
Boy Scouts (which is probably noth-
ing but Scout Master P.R.—I, for
one, have never seen anyone actually
light a ﬁre with two sticks. Talk is
cheap, unless you’re saying “fuck"
repeatedly on KDIC.). Think of it;
all those candles, and not a chance of
fire. A candle withoutmatches is about
as threatening as the electric chair
during a power outage.

There’s no point in banning
candles, because just about any-

Adventures in suburbia

Thanksgiving once again found
me at home with my parents. more
out of habit than an innate desire to
share this absurd holiday with those
who allowed me the dubious privi»
lege of entering this world. Ah, the
Cold drive home. The turkey. The
instant mashed potatoes. The Mall.

Home for me is the Chicago sub»
urbs. Warrenville, to be exact, though
I usually say Wheaton because that‘s
where I went to high school and be-
cause some people have actually heard
of Wheaten. Each break, I get the
pleasure of returning to DuPage
County, known as “the fastest growr
ingcounty in thecountry."Eachbreak,
a new building has appeared. new
stores are opened, slightly fewer new
stores areclosed,and the Warrenville
population seems to have grown ex-
ponentially.

The most fascinating adventure to
behad in my homecounty isavisitto
the Mall. This break, my friend Beth
and I went to Stratford Square on
Friday. This particular mall on this
particular day was absolutely packed
with mostly upper middle class,
mostlywhire,mostlyteenageornewly
parenting shoppers. We watched in
awe as the endless stream ﬁltered
through the doors. All the “ﬂuffy
muffies,"asmyroommatewouldsay,
hanging on the arms of their letter-
jacket-wearing boyfriends, made me
rather nauseous as feminist teachings
flashed through my mind and fell out
the other side in the face of such a

Alanna

wellrentrenched opposition.
Actually, I had a good time. I’m
leamingtoenjoy shopping forclothes.
It’samazing how differentlyl’vebeen
treated since I started dressing like a
real person. Like a girl, even. Ever
since I first dressed myself, I've
looked like a fashion nightmare, but
in tile past year or two I’ve realized
how important appearances are. Friv
day at the Mall, I was obviously mis-

taken for someone with a sense of
style. My nice sweater, faded jeans,
and black boots fooled sales clerks
into believing that I knew what shin
would go with which pants. It was
funibeing treated like a human be-
ing who's itching to spend money in
their stores.

holdingmybags,eatjngmyminiscule

is whatlife in the suburbs is all about.
It’s good to be back in Grinnell.

IGNOBLE PURSUITS

LL handle ‘Httis-

thing not only candles—can be
bumed.IfItntlyfeelrampantlyrogu-
ishandIcan'tfindanycandles,what’s
to prevent me from burning some-
thing more creative? Word on the
streets is that the posters in Norris
Lounge flame better than any old
chunk of lard. And there's always
lounge fireplaces tobeenjoyed, spon—
ing ﬂaming chunks of wood approxi-
mately 50 times the size of the aver-
age candle. Or hey. I can tell you
myself (waving my $50 ﬁne from
Oda Callison as proof) that lighting
Roman candles makes lighting regu-
lar candles look about as exciting as
sniffing glueeompared to mainlining
cocaine.

To effectively reduce risk of cone
flagration, you’ve got to ban not only
the candles themselves but rather the
things which turn simpleeandles (and

light my ﬁre

posters, and curtains, and so forth)
into dangerous fire hazards—you
need to ban all implements that ig-
nite. (Either that. or you have to ban
the other half of the ﬁre hazard duo:
idiotic carelessness. Good fucking
luck. And while you’re at it, don‘t
forget to ban famine, war, pestilence
and lincrculting at Cowles.) In other
words. no matches, no lighters, no
two sticks. No hunters on gasor elec-
uie stoves. No incandescent light
bulbs. No curling irons. No micro-
waves-n»tinfoil combos, No magniv
fying glasses to sizzle luckless ants
on hot days. Oh, sure, that’s pos-
sible—and about as probable as me
being elected Pope.

And then, of course, there’s the
really fun partto all of this—the ques-
tion of how the administration ex-
pects to enforce its various anti-ﬁre
hazard bans. Should we expect rov‘
ing administrators to burst into our
rooms regularly, checking up on us?
Is it time to prepare for middle-of-
the-night drills‘.7 “Everybody up!
Come on! Let‘s get these drawers
open here! Whereare you hiding those
contraband candles, kid? What have
we hereﬁis this aZIPPO’! Don'tyou
know lighters are a ﬁre waiting to
happen?" Sound vaguely familiar?
It's that long-abused issue of inva<
sion of privacy. Suppose someone
comes into my dorm room Iooldng
for candles or lighters ormy personal
two sticks, and ﬁnds nolany ofthese,
but rather several ounces of the best
dope money can buy. I suppose one
can argue that both items are poten»
tially ﬁre hazardsil mean, I see
myself setting fire to some good Thai
stick longbeforel’dtorchapotpoun‘i-
scented lump of wax—butone is des-
tined to get me into far more trouble
than the other. So what does the ge-
neric administrator do when he digs
up cannabis instead of candles in my
underwear drawer? Say “oops" and
put it back?
