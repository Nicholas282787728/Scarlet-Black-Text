There is nothingso importantas
procrastination. This, the official
mantra ofGrinnellCollege,seemsto
take on even more importance as
paper deadlines and (trials draw near.
On a Sunday afternoon when the
bars are closed, the movies are bad,
and work is inconceivable, the alter-
native is clear: Will—Mart is the place
[0 be.

Unlike the forum grill or news—
paper section in Btirling, which offer
only hatmless ten or twenty minute
diversions, WELMBH can suck ene
tite afternoons item your life, espe»
cially lfseven or eight of those hours
ote spent looking {or someone who
owns a working cat. By my calcula»
tions, my GPA would be at least
three—tenths ofapoint higher ifl had
spent those 2000 hours reading fasci-
nating accounts of Henry Adams
rather than debating between the
pntehase of gummy beats and Oreos,

snte, thete ate purists who
wouldn’t daresetfootinachainstore
that so ruthlessly sucks the life and
personality out of every small town

in America. . , unless, ofcoutse, they
really do give you free popcorn just
for Coming in.

But I digress. The cynicism is
unwarranted. I really like Wail-mart.
In fact, there are few pleasures better
than coming home from WnlMatz,
knowing that you got abargain. From
petsonnlexpetience, I’ve determined
that the perceived usefulness of an
item increases proportionally as the
sale price decreases. (“Look!" I said
to a friend recently while perusing
the shelves at the Mecca of consume
erism, “they’re selling that stuff you
put in Easter baskets for ﬁve cents!
That's 75% off! I've got 20 dollars,
which means I could get 400 bags!"
"But Erin.” she responded rationally,
“what would you do with it?" Caught
off guard by the logic of het argu—
ment, I muttered under my breath
that there were plenty of things one
could do with 400 bags of Easter
grass, and if she was so unimagina-
tive, I wouldn't bother to let her in
on my Martha Stewart plans.)

I realize that offering bargains is
not the sole function ofWal—Mart. I
know that, at times, I have actually
bought useful items, such as tooth-

/T6 I a y? (comm

paste and deodorant. I! is at these
points that I have had the unfortu-
nate tendency to run into my profes-
sors. For some reason, my first in—
stinct is always [0 hide whatever I‘m
buying and feign nonchalance, as
though a professor, uponviewing my
purchase. would be saying to herself,
“My GOD! I can’t helieye she's buy»
ing toothpaste! How embarrassing!
Doesn’t she have self-cleaning teeth
like the rest of us?"

Just lastweekl lost all my capac—
ity for coherent speech after my writ—
ing lab instructor greeted me enthu-
siastically in the checkout line. Too
often I forget that she, like many of
mypmfessors, is human and needs to
buy peanut butter M St Ms, too.

Someday, when I am rich, I’ll
spend my vacations at Wal-Mart,
buying mechanical pencils and bad
country CDs and shirts with lame
slogam on the front without fear of
consequences. I’ll memorize the park-
ing lot so I don’t ever inﬁiriate the
locals by driving in the wrong way on
a one way tow, forcing them to slow
down to a mere 40 miles per hour.
And I‘ll scoff at anyone who tries to

buy toorhpaste.
