By Jessica Henry

The tracksters rolled out of town
early Saturday morning, suffering
the long trip to Loras College in
Dubuque. The trip proved worth
while for the track animals how—
ever, there were many personal
bests, new school records andatrip
to Nationals earned It was also a
fun meet for me team because all of
the coaches participated in indi-
vidual events and ran in the 4x100
relay.

School records are constantly
being reset this season in the pole

vault1 last weekend proved to be no
exception. Daron Robertson set the
new record clearing a height of
14’10"t Lee Kraemer and coach

Women's track improves at Loras

By Doug Hodum

This pastweekend onlysix mem-
bers of the women's track team
traveled to toras to compete. Dee
spite so few competitors, three of
the women performed very well.

Jennifer Jones once again had a
“good meet" according to Coach
Evelyn Freemanshe won the 100M
dash in :13.10 andplaced second in
the Zoom event with a clocking of
£7.20. In addition to those two
high placings. she ran a very good
split of the 4X100M relay race.
Jessica Henry, as she has done al-
most every meet, bettered her per-
sonal time in the 1500M race with
a time of 5:20.00.

Missy Ebitz also had a personal
best throw in lhejavelin with a toss
of91’2",as well as running agood
splitin the4XlOOMrelay.Thetettm

is hoping to continue the trend set
by these three women as they head
to conference in two weeks,
CoachFrccman is hoping thatat
Conference the 4Xl00M and
4X400M relay teams will be able to
establish new school records. She
also Said that Conference will be a
team meet where “everyone will
contribute something." The team is
armed with “a lot of strong rune
ncrs“ in a variety of events. While
Coach Freeman admits there are
some holes in the team, they are
vcry strong in some events.
Reviewing the mid-season
rankings for most events reveals
Gt-innellian women in the top eight
of the conference. Coach Freeman
is hoping that the team will come
together and put in a total team
effort. as it has done for most of the
seasonshe is“reallypleased" with
