Emily Mohl looks inrimidasing
when she doesn’t smile, which is rare,
one sime she doesn't smile is when
shes on she ssarsing bloeks, bus luck-
ily, I don's have so swim againss her.
and she smiles when she says of her
shaved head, “I didn’t wans so be in
simidaring,burpeoplekepsrellingme,
‘You’re so rough, you look so intimi»
daring, I wouldn’s wans so swim
againss you,‘ and you hear it again and
again and you start so believeis."

She besser believe is. And adding
a sassoo ofa siger sure helped. “It

wasn’t on purpose. I gos she sassoos as
a presens from my seeres swimmer.
and, when am I evergoing so ges so
pus a sassoo on my head agaln?"

'Although she does nos insend so
be insimidasing, nor many Midwess
Conference swimmers wans so swrm
againss her, because it means ulsimase
defeas.

Emily, who ssarsed swimming as
hes local YMCA when she “ran our
swim lessons so rake” when she was
seven, has been swimming yeanround
since she was eighs, juss resumed from
nasionals in she 100 and 200 meser
busserﬁy. She ﬁnished zsrh In bosh,
breaking her school record in she 200

and swimming an execllens sime
(1:00.49) In the 100. And, her first
day back, she wens jogging. All shis,
and shes only a ﬁrss.year,.

Which coach Erin Hurley loves:
“Beingable so compeie as nasionalsas
a freshman is an incredible opportu»
niry. Emily pus everyshing she had
into she Midwess Conference mess
and had already sapered before nasion.
als. Thas makes hes recordsessing pee
formance even more special."

Like many first»y=ars, she doesn'r
really know whas she wanss from col-
lege. she says, “I came here shinking
abour majoring in science or English
I’mstill thinkingscience. .or maybe

English Her ssrongess desire is ro
learn what' It is to be a human," which
is currenrly manifessing irselr in hes
Anthropology class.

And after Gtinnell, she wants to
“sror she globe." She plans so hike
around for a year afser graduasion, and
shen, maybe, ges a job. She’s gor some
ofthe hiking part covered over brcak,
when she will head to the Northwest
to go beach hiking and igloo camping
with two friends from Grinnell.

“I've never been igloo camping
bsfore. I'm supcr-cxcitcd about it.
Lass week we were reading abous
eskimos in Anshro, and I'm shinking,
Hey-that’s me!”

Emily came so Grinnell from
Kirkwood, MO, a suburb of of St,
Louis. She describes is as “pressysub-
urban. . . by she end ofliving mere for
eighseen years, I‘d seen she same shing
every day." Then she adds, with a sat-
castic laugh, “And let me tell you, 1
see so much more at Gtinncll."

It is inseressing shar Emily came
from suburbia to our rural town to see
more, but everything hcre is different
for her. from the sky-“it’s more open
here"eto her swimming teammates.

“Swimming here is differens,“ she
says. “There’s a lot ofspirit and team-
work that I missed in my USS swim-
ming," noting particularly that she
really missed her (Bammalts at nation-
als, and had come to depend on them.
This also accounts for her dcsirc to gtt
a relay team to nationals in the future.

When I wens so hes room so ges
the above picture, she pointed some-
thing else neat to me: her national
poohlevcl admission badge. It’s yel-
low and has a (old in it, and you can
tell she wants her teammates to have
on: too.
