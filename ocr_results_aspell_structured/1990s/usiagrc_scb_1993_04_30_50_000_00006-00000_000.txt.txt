HE top team in the southern
I division of tlte Midwest Con
ference golf will be decided
this weekend when the ﬁve confer-
ence teams visit the three Iowa sites
of Cornell, Coe and Grinnell. Grinr
nellwarmed upforlhedivision cham-
pionship last weekend in the Titan
Classic at IllinoisWesleyan. The Pio-
neers ﬁnished sixth in the IS-team
tourney.

In the Illinois Wesleyan touma-
ment, the Gn'nnell golfers were led by
co-captain Chris Zug, who ﬁnished
ﬁfth in the overall individual stand-
ings. He shot an 83 Friday and an 80
Saturday Neil Goodspeed ﬁnished
second with coresofSS-Sél Sean Fore-

86, and Cullen Davis 94-96.

After the first round of play the
Pioneers sat in ninth place, but they
shot nine strokes better Saturday to
leap to sixth place. The tourney was

The “Iowa Swing” of the south-
ern division will start Friday at the
Finkbine Course in Iowa City. and
will then move toEllis Park in Cedar
Rapids on Saturday. Sunday the tour-
ney will wrap up at Oakland Acres in
Grinnell.

According to Coach Greg
Wallace, none of the southern divi-
sion teams are outof the running yeti
“Cornell is golﬁng exceptionally well
right now, but Knox is still probably
the favorite. Illinois College is also a
bit ahead of us, and I don’t think we
can count Coe out either,” he ex-
plained.

 

After Drake
Men’s Track

T the Coe Invitational this
Saturday the Grinnell Col
lege men’s uack team has

its last chance to tune up before com—
peting in the Midwest Conference
championships May 7»8.

Coach Will Freeman commented
on the importance of the Coe meet:
“Our athletes are looking to run their
top times of the season in order to
attain higher seeds for the league
meet. The distance crew will notrun
their events and the sprinters are goA
ing to participate in a limited fash-
ionl"

Lastweekend the squad was split
as three relay teams competed at the
DrakeRelays while otherathletesran

hopes the relay quartets did not fare
well. Freeman noted, however, that
sprinters Darren Young and Chad
Folsom looked strong but the restof
the units did not seem to click. ”The
simple anwer to our problem was a

strenuous week of training. Those
relay teams will perform well latcrin
the season. However, it was a good
experience for them to compete at
Drake," said Freeman.

At Loras two Pioneers caught
the attention of their coach. Pole
vaulter Rick Wiederien Cleared 13-0
for third place. Freemancommented,
“Rick just continues to improve. I
think he could bea factor at the con-
ference meet."

The other top performance came
from Barry Matchett in the 5000M,

which should get him notice among
league runners “Barry ran a good
time on a very windy day," said the
coach.

Freeman noted that his team is
right on schedule to peak at the loop
meet. “I feel good aboutwhcre weare

day cycle as we focus in on May 778.
chcht us to run well."
