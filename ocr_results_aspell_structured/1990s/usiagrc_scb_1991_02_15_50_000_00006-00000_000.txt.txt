For mature
audiences only

The idea of debating the war in the Persian Gulf is indeed a noble and
serious one. The Grinnell Debate Society seems to share these two
notions. but the recent debate in Herrick Chapel seemed to make a
mockery of the whole issue. This indeed is a major problem. considering
the seriousness of tile topic.

The problem penains not to the attitude of the debaters. They were
genuinely interested in arguing over
the meritsof Operation DesertStorm,
The debaters handled themselves in
a most orderly manner, much more
so. it may be said, than presidential
candidates engaging in the phony

rhetoric they call a debate. Edltorlal
The problem lies not in the format

used by the debaters, hut in the exploitation of this form by unruly
audiences. Debaters may be interrupted at any Lime during their speeches
by the audience, who may ask questions. The speakers are not required to
recognize them, but they generally do so outof fairness and adherence to
this style of debate, apparently pmcucedsince the dawnofGrinnell debate
sometime in the misty past.

Our criticism is directed at the audience. whofelt it necessary tobypass
the civility of being recognized before they speak by blatantly and
randomly vocalizing their views. Marshmallows were thrown from the
balcony, and debaters were not asked intelligent questions so much as
berated by people opposed to the debaters view.

This type ofjaded behavior by a group of students at Grinnell is not
uncommon, and even more inexcusable here; weas students have no right
to make light of the debate, which concerns the death of American
soldiers, many our age. When the Grinnell Debate Society argues over an
issue as emotionally and politically divisiveas this one. we should expect
to hear good debates by the debaters and respect for the style of debate
from the audience, thelatter sorely missing. if this form of argumentation
has survived solong.itmusthaveitbencfiLs.namelyaudienee participation.
This beneﬁt must not be lost.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students react to Farrakhan follower

To the editor,

This is an open letter to the Office
of Multi-Cultural Affairs and the
Rosenfield Program:

As members of the Grinnell
Jewish community, we feel com»
pelled to respond to the invitation
of Zahir Mohammud to campus
and his subsequent comments. We
are offended by the attacks he di~
reeled towards Jewish, Christian,
Arab Moslem. Gay. Lesbian, Bi-
sexual and White students. We be-

lievethalaunifiedcommunitymust
be founded on respect for,
acknowledgement and celebration
of our differences,

This can only be accomplished
through sensitivity and dialogue
among all groups. We believed that
this was also the function ofMulLi~
Cultural Affairs. But bringing a
representative of Louis Farrakhan
is clearly antithetical to this pur-
pose and makes us question the
intentions and sensibilities of Multi-
Cultuml Affairs.

Neavins criticizes debate

To the editor,

I would like to commend the
speakers in Sunday’s debate on
Desert Storm for their excellent
preparation and ﬁelding of those
questions they chose to answer,

rise above this and consider how
our behavior affected those who
know people in the warand who are
extremely scared for them and for

debate. Perhaps this was the serious
discussion and debate I was seek-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
OCCO language houses possible

Many concerns have been voiced
as of late regarding the proposal to
change mostofthe offrcampuscoi-
legerowned (OCCO) houses into
permanent language houses. First,
though. some facts: Currently there
are ten OCCO houses. The lan-
guagedeparunentheads are asking
that six of those houses be con-
verted into permanent language
houses. The problem lies in the fact
that once the new residence hall is
built at least three OCCO houses
will be targeted for razing. Theron
fore, six of seven OCCO houses
would effectively be Closed out to
non-language students (or. altcma-
lively.onlyoneOCCOhousewould
then be available for nonrlanguage
sludenls),

I have received dozens of com-
putcrmcssagcsby students whoare
opposed to this proposal. I have
printed them all outand have given
them to Tom Crady, the Dean of
Student Affairs. He is aware that
there is a lot of student opposition
to such a proposal. Therefore. al-
though he is very much in favor of
the language liouse proposal. he
has told me that he is wtlling to
compromise and is only going to
recommend that two or three houses

Pedro Fernandez-
McCarthy

be designated language houses for
next year. That being the case. I
have assured him that I will not
oppose him. This means that next
year at least seven OCCO houses
will be available for students-at-
largetodrawinto,Oneshouldkeep
in mind that in years past, Latin
House. German House. Russian
House and Spanish House have co-
existed. As far as I'm concerned.
two or three language houses is not
an unreasonable proposition.

For those of you who have been
wonderingwhyitisthatyoucannol
