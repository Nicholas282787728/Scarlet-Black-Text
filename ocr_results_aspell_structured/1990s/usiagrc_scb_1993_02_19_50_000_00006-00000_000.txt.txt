Alum brings experience and insight

By Jesse Michael Kane

HEN 1979 graduate
Wendy Knox arrived in
Grinnell she never

dreamt that she would tnake a career
in theatre. Today, her résumé in-
cludes her own acting company, a
Fulbright scholarship, and 21 plays
that she has directed. More imprcsV
sive, however, is the fact that Knox
came to Grinnell with her sights set
on a major in chemistry and only one
highschooltheatercredittohcrname.

Guest director for Machinnl,
Knoxrecalls graduallybecomtngless
interested in chemistry and particir
pating in an Open Space production
during her sophomore year.

”Everyone else involved had
some area ofexpertjse: acting, light-
ing, costumes. I lacked any tangible
skills, so by default, I became the
director,“ recalls Knox,

Family approval was Slow in
coming, Her father, a life-long aca-
demic, couldn't understand the util-
ity ofa theater degree. Knox‘s father
realized his daughter’s talent once
she was awarded a Fulbright Schol-
arship to study in Finland in 1984.

Knox said that as a result of the
scholarly requirements associated
with the Fulbright, "My dad finally
had an academic reference from
which to judge what I was doing."

Today, Knox works as an inde~
pendent director and leads the Frank
Theater, 2 company she founded.
Although she enjoys her work, she
admits that being an independent di-
rector is occasionally frustrating.
lntermiuentwork means intermittent
pay. Even her own company hasn’t
provided her with any financial sta-
bility. Add to that the stress involved
in ”auditioning” to direct other the
atcrs‘ productions, and her job can be
trying.

Performing Arts presents folk singer

Acclaimed sixties celebrity Odetza payr return visit to Grinnell

NE of the leading singers of the Sixties Folk Movement, Odette

appeared on the program ofGrinnell' s first week-long folk festival.

She has been a friend to Grinnell ever since, and her appearance
here next Wednesday evening reﬂects this long friendship.

Since her first visithere, Odetta has sung throughout theworld. A recent
tour of the former SovietUnion drew a full column in thelrvertia which said,
“... Odetla offers her audience insight into the sounds of the Black experi-
ence... her voice is an instrument of unlimited range, or rare profoundness
and purity of tone“. the audience opened notonly their hands to applaud her
but their hearts, as well."

Odetta‘s voice, with its broad range, is shaded towards the spiritual.
Come and listen on Wednesday, February 24; at 8 pm. in the South Lounge.
