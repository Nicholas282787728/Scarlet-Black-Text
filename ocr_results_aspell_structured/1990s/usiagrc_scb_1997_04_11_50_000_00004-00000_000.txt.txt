Rigid approach to formal diversity

Does Grinnell College’s decision on IVCF really promote diversity?

BY GREGORY C. SISK
Associate Professor of Law
Drake University

In her column defending Grinnell
College’s decision to decertify a
campus religious organization for
refusing to abandon its religious prin-
ciples, Rekha Basu asserted: “Last
year, most people applauded when
the University of Iowa decenified the
student chapter of the Black Ameri-
can Law Students Association for
denying membership to students who
aren’t black" (“Exclusion Issue Di-
vides Grinnell,“ March 14)

I don‘t know what survey Basu is
relying upon to claim the support of
the majority. But as one who speaks
and writes on issues of freedom of
expression and thought, I was not
among those applauding.

I believe the Iowa law school emr
barrassed itself by applying a rigid
policy of enforced forrrlal diversity
that in practice crushed true diver-
sity. One might conclude that it was
unwise for BALSAto limit member
ship, and I might share that judg
ment. But a sincere commitment to
meaningful diversity means allowing
those with diverse perspectives to
think and act in accordance with their
own principles, absent some danger-
ous disruption to essential order.

Freedom of thought is inseparable
from freedom of association. People
of shared commitment may properly
join together in promoting, the prin-
ciples or identity of the group with»
out legitimately being accused of
invidious discrimination.

Now Grinnell College has joined
the trend of restricting diversity on
its campus in the very name of pro-
moting diversity. It has apparently

crisper... Guys ask how I get that
big sound and I say ’bring me’any
drum and I'll get that sound.‘ It's
the person playing the drums that
matters, and the hand. "

Poncho uses everything from his
ﬁngertips to the base ofhis palms to
achieve the resounding tones of his
mmbas, mambos, charangas, boleros
and the bebop-based Latin jazz he so

” zestftilly delive‘r's. Who better to

carry‘ on ’the ' traditions of
Mongo...Machito...Tito...and
Cal...than Poncho Sanchez. He will
continue to generate a torrent of ii-
ery Latin jazz and salsa and take it
to even greater heights.

Doors will open at 9pm tomorrow
for the 9:30 show.

 

Media hounds failed to feast on
Hale—Bopp believers

BY SIERRA SOLEIL
Columnist

I had occasion over break to see the
Hale-Bopp comet. For those of you
who haven’t seen it, it looks like a
dim glop of ice cream slowly sliding
down the night sky. Perhaps I am
underrating the signiﬁcance of this—
comets are, after all, really quite im-
pressive things, and large enough to
smash Earth into convenient bite-size
chunks. Fortunately, I feel conﬁdent
enough in my terrestriality not to take
it too seriously.

As I learned from public radio one
aftemoon in the car, however, there
are others who do not share my sen-
timent. Speciﬁcally, I am referring
to the Heaven’s Gate organization
(cult is such a' nasty word) in Cali—
fornia. Ihad heard vague rumors of
lots of dead bodies in a house in a
wealthy neighborhood, but this was
the ﬁrst substantial report I had en,
countered, and right away I noticed
something different about it. There
was an air of simple curiosity com-
ing from the reporter, There was
even a sort of whimsicality borderr
ing on indifference, A Verbal shrug-
ging of the shoulders. The reporter
described at length the various rooms

ofbodies, the similar dress of all the
dead, the shrouds, the suicides go-
ing in waves. The age range of the
dead was repeated over and over
again.

Of course, by this time I was take
ing anything I heard with a grain of
salt. Previously the dead had been
all men, their leader had been gay,
and they had all been spiritualized
computer geeks. What was true and
what was not seemed to be going to
the highest bidder.

Out of all the unsubstantiated junk
I heard, though, what I didn’t hear
once was the word tragedy. Nor did
I hear shocking. Nobody seemed
frightened or victimized by the event.
The neighbors interviewed by NPR
were more concerned by the media
trafﬁc on their lawns than by any
thing else. The New York Times
didn‘t even care enough to get its
information straight.

I guess what it comes down to is
thatthisjustwasn’tenough. Itdidn‘t
pique our interests because it was just
dead people. There was no violence,
no mystery, no killer on the loose,
not crying family members, no de-
struction of property, and all the
weirdness seems to have died with
the people themselves. All that was

left were a bunch of quiet, orderly,

straightforward dead people all car- .

rying proper DD—nothing to whet the
nightly news voyeurs’ appetites.

Perhaps, in the end I should be ap-
preciative of America's cool re-
sponse to the events in California
Perhaps I should see it as a sign of
improvement that there was no sen-
sationalism. But really, [think it was
just too difﬁcult to sensationalize
what was probably the most straighb
forward massvsuicide in history.
When the facts turned out to be
merely curious, instead of graphic or
heartwrenching, our journalists sud-
denly decided it was time to uphold
the code of impartiality. And they
held it up to the point of apathy. The
media didn‘t even have the spunk to
cook up a decent conspiracy theory.
Maybe if one of the dead had been
rich, or in politics, or OJ. Simpson,
then more effort would have shown.
But instead it was just another day
with a bunch of dead people, and
hardly even a blip in a CVSPAN sat-
ellite. The whole Heaven’s Gate
crowd is probably up on their space
ship right now shrugging their shoulr
ders and wondering, “Who the heck
do you have to sleep with to get some
attention around here?"

become the first college in tlic counr
try to disqualify a student religious
group as a campus organization be»
cause that group had the courage of
its convictions. Having established
its own orthodox view on the com
plex and controversial issue of gay
rights, Grinnell College insists upon
strict conformity with that position
even to the extent of overriding reli-
gious freedom and conscientious
objection. '

Unfortunately, Grinnell “College
acted to resolve a false conﬂict in a
manner that infringes freedom of
thought on its
campus. In this
particular case,
contrary to
Basu‘s sugges-
tion, there simply
is no conﬂict be—
tween gay rights
and religious
freedom. The is
sue was one of
eligibility for
leadership of a re
ligious organiza
tion. A gay activ—
ist on campus has no more “right" to
be selected as the leader of an evanr
gelical Christian organization than
does the president of the lnlerVarsity
Christian Fellowship (IVCF) have a
“right" to be selected as the leader
of the Stonewall Coalition for gay
students.

Note that eligibility for leadership
is all that is at issue; gay students are
in no way excluded from IVCF ac-
tivities or membership. Even in lead-
ership, the group does not discrimi-
nate on the basis of sexual oricntar
tion. It requires only that its leaders
afﬁrm the biblical teaching that i107

Too often

diversity that.,.is

of thought.

lnosexual Conduct is immoral. By
punishing this position, Grinnell
College has essentially declared that
this is all ilnpcl’miSSlbiC interpreta-
tion oldie Bible. How presumptu-
ous for any secular institution to on
dain the acceptable content of rclir
gious belief for its students!

What will come next? Will the cola
Icgc disaffiliate a student Catholic
group because it does not allow a
woman to celebrate the Eucharist.7
Will all other religious groups be
decemﬁed because, to no one's sure
prise, they select leaders on the ba-
sis of religious
conviction?

Will the student
Republican club
be disqualified
because it ”LilSr
criminales" on
the basis of po
lilical affiliation
in choosing its
lcadership'7
Surely no legitin
malt: institution
of higher cduca»
tlun would tolcrr
ate discrimination on the bztsis of
political party affiliation ill Its ofﬁv
cial activities. But does a student
political group violate that princlple
by expecting some fidelity to apo»
litical philosophy in its leadership?
Nonsense. Allowmg student groups
to ﬂourish and stake out independent
perspectives on issues is the essence
oftrue diversity.

Too often institutions ofhighet edu-
cation cxtol a hollow form ofdiver-
sity, that while including differences
in race, gender and sexual orientar
tion is closed to diversity ofthought.
The acid test of a commitment to

 

 

 

 

 

 

meaningful diversity is whether we
will tolerate people whose world
views, and not merely appearance,
are radically different from or even
incompatible with our own.

As Harvard Professor Alan
Dersllowilz has observed, calls for
diversity in universities seldom in
clude evangelical Christians, those
who oppose abortion or Republicans
groups that are woefully
underrepresented on most campuses
(including, I suspect, Grinnell), par»
tlcularly among the faculty and ad
ministraiors.

Lest lhc pall of orthodoxy fall over
the campus and chill dissenting pera
spcclives, a university has an oblia
gallon to err always on the side of
extending freedom of thought. IN
the words of former Yale University
President Benno Schmidt, the as-
sumption of some “seems to be that
the purpose ofeducation is to induce
correct opinion rather than to search
for wtsdom and liberate the mind."
The first mission of a university.
which takes priority over all else, is
encourage free exploration of ideas.
No other agenda, no other cause, no
other political platform may be per»
mitted to overshadow that fundamenr
tal purpose.

When a student group is branded as
subversive not on the basis of ac-
tions, but of principles sincerely held.
has tolerance in a meaningful sense
rather than in formal appearance
been extended or contracted? Have
those with diverse and dissenting
perspectives been welcomed or re-
buffed? I think these questions an-
swer themselves
