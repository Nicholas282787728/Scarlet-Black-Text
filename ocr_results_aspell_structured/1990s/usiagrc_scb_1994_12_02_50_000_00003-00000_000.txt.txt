Can ’t Talk, Eating!

E are taking a break right
now from our dreidel
marathon that started

Sunday at dusk so we can wish you a
happy Chanuka. We are trying to
explain the game to Jul, but we are
having difﬁculty because that goya
just doesn't understand Hebrew or
Yiddish.

At this time we would like to
give a hearty thanks to Dave
McConnell for being sympathetic to
the students by attempting to solve
the Wok Bar situation. Ofcourse we
have the perfect solution to this prob-
leminext semester install chicken

Since we have already reviewed
this week, we are going to comment
on some ol'the “alternative” choices
oflhis week. In other words, the ones
we wouldn't dare touch. Friday dine
ner we have refritos. Is that a fruit or
a vegetable7 For four years we have
been itching to taste this, but we have
never worked up the courage.

Sunday lunch gets Matt up on
his soap box (lunch box?) A potato
pancake is not pancake batter with
potato chunks thrown in! At least
they don’t dare to call it a latke. Hey
Dave.ifyouwantarealrecipelason’s
grandmother has it delicious one. If
you wanttogo all out, BRING BACK
THE BLINTZES! (They used to
have them, you know.)

Sunday dinner only offers the

Sweet and sour tofu. If you eat meat,
however, stay away from the dining
hall. Barbequed short ribs scare the
hell out olus Thesethings wouldn‘t
pass fora McRib. Sure the meat falls
right off the bone, but that’s because
it is lubricated wlth a layer of fat.

Monday boasts tuna bunstead.
What the hell is a bunstead and why
is the tuna hot? Jon doesn't go down
for turln bunstead. The refried beans
are okay if you paste them on your
taco shell. Otherwise they taste the
way they look

The shepherd’spiethatisserved
for Tuesday lunch is a favorite for
many. Most ofthc people who enjoy
it are shepherds, It‘s all part of our
cultural exchange program with New
Zealand. Fordinnertrythe skroodles.

It‘s a type ofpztsta that is 3 feet long
when properly unravelled. Give it a
shot, and if yours isn't long enough
remember it’s not length that counts.

It’s time to get serious as we
approach Thursday's lunch. We
haven't been to a Thursday lunch
Since May 19, 1992. It has been
brought to our attention that chopped
chicken is served at the salad bar.
We’ve heard that chicken salad is a
tasty alternative to the hot German
potato sald. For dinner we like lentils
(ja. right) but not when hey are shoved
into ground beef and served in a lentil
burger.

Stay tuned for next week‘s ar-
ticle, the last one of the semester in
which we will have an eera~special
announcement!
