The Announcer Game

Hi Fans! Ever made innoryonr

an opinion doesn't hel A

to comment. My dad used to hare
announcers so much, he’d [urn rh:

himselﬁ

it just wasn‘t quite the same
though. Somchow, everything just
becomes so clearl Well. you too can
sce the world with such clarity as
sportscasters do. Just practice the
following roles, which require two
announcers, and then, make up
your own, Remember. kids, anr
nunciarc!

As you can see, these two an-
nouncers used the popular ploy of
celebrating a star's superb accom-
plishments and riding them like a
freight train, This is an easy one,
because it is simple to exaggerate
one’s greatness,

A little more difﬁcult is belie

next.

him I don’t even want to sec
where these guys walk.

Here, Bob and John astutcly
point our the shortcomings of a
team. They erreetively do so by us-
ing useless jargon and clichc’s.

rebuke that great American and say
that the spoken word is not only
more powerful, but makes a lot
more sense. Just lookabove: every.

Women’s XC improves

By Andrew Sherburne
Spor‘ls Writer .

Like a fine wine. the women's
crossrccuntry team seems to get
better ovcr time. Each meet this
year has produced season bests as
wcll as many lifetime bests for the
women harricrs.

Last weekend's Augustana Invi»
rational was no exception. Nicole
Cucno ’02 again led the Pioneers.
she posted a 5k time or19t02 to
finish 12th overall our ofavcr 200
runners, Alison Nair ’02 and Kano
Groark ’03 Followed ﬁnishing S4rh
and 86rl1 rcspcctivcly. Ann Yacger
’01 ran another lifetime best of
21:06 for the fourth bcsr Pioneer
Time. Other Grinnell notable: in»
cludcd sophomores Emily Kearney
and Thcrcsa Hahn.

“We've always looked iorward
to fast times at Augie with their
quick and relatively ﬂat course,"
commented Coach Evelyn Free.
man, “but it had been changed a
bit from previous years so although
the times were good, they weren't
as fast as we had predicted." _

As a team Grinncll ﬁnished
llrh our CF24 teams. As usual, the
field at Augustana was comprised

of many of the top Division III
teams, including Augustana.
“There were a lor orstrong schools
at this meet and I think that we
were able to racc competitivelywith
Them," said Nair.

The Pioneers have another
rough meet coming up this week-
end in Chicago. The Lakefront in.
vitational, hosted by Loyola, brings
together teams from all three
NCAA divisions as well as NAIA
schools and Canadian universities.

The Augustana meet was a
prime example orthe team’s rigor
oos training. “Many people ran the
fastest times ortheir running career.
which shows that our team has im-
proved greatly rrom last season and
will be competitive in the confer—
ence,“ explained Kearney

“Th: season is progressing
nicely. Most people are consistently
dropping times and I think as a
team we are getting better at racing
smartly," agreed Nair.

Airet the Loyola meet, the lady
harriers will travel to Monmouth
with the mens reamThat meet will
serve as a warm up for the Confer-
ence championships in early No,
vember.
