LETTERS

To the editor"

 

Dear members of the
Grinnell College community,

We believe that Professor
Baleman's letter in the February 7th
S&B warrants a response front fac-
ulty who dtffer from his position on
the reinstatement of InlerVarsity
Christian Fellowshrp’s status as a stu-
dent group. We, too, have some res-
ervations about engaging in this de-
bate in the student newspaper; how-
ever, since one member of the fac-
ulty has expressed his views, we
think that those of us who hold alter-
native views should share them as
Well.

We would ﬁrst like to commend the
students who initiated and signed the
thoughtful, carefully considered let.
ter in the January 31st sate. We
concur with their analysis of the situe
ation, and we support their efforts to
respond to what they, and we, under.
stand to be an issue of socraljustice.
We are dismayed that they would be
scolded for their response to a con—
cern that the college not violate its
nondiscrimination policy. Even if
members of this community disagree
with them, their advocacy position
needs to be respected as demonstrat~
ing the best of Grinnell's values and
instruction in the advance of human
rights.

In terms oflhe substance ofthe is-
sue, we reject the vrew that this is a
free-speech issue. We are ardent civil
libertarians who are committed to the
lively exchange of ideas, in both writ-
ten and oral communication. We
believe that violations ofspeech need
to be countered, not With less speech,
but with more dialogue, more Opinr
ion. and more voices. However, this
principle is not the issue at hand.
Whether or not lnterVarsity Christian
Fellowship is ofﬁcially recognized as
a student group, its members are en-
titled to continue meeting and voic-

ilig their views on the Grinnell Col-
lege campus

The point IS that Grinnell College
has a nondisei-iniination policy.
which applies to offrcrally-recoge
nizcd student groups. Groups which
are ofﬁcially recognized must be in
compliance with the egalitarian prin-
ciples upon which Grinnell College
was founded and continues to oper-
ate. The 1964 Civil Rights Act, and
subsequent legislative and judicial
statutes, undergird the college's de-
velopment ofa strong anllvdtscrimi—
nation policy, which guides this in—
stitution in the protection of the rights
of all students, faculty. and staff,

At issue is an apparent Conflict of
rights—those of one protected group
(gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgendered persons) and those of
another protected group (the relir
gious organization, IVCF). On the
Grinnell campus, we affirm IVCF's
right to speak, assemble, and express
their beliefs on homosexuality, with
which we disagree. However, be-
cause their belrefs result in discrimi-
nation against GLBT persons, we
believe IVCF should not be accorded
status as an ofﬁcially-recognized stun
dent group. “Even though IVCF says
that gay and lesbian persons can be
leaders in their group, the apparent
inclusion oflesbians and gay men is
negated by IVCF‘s insistence that
their leaders profess that homosexue
ality is sinful, In others words, gay
and lesbian members. in order to
lead, must repudiate their very selves
and any sexual expression consistent
with who they are.

This “catch 22” Stipulation is a
subtle but powerful fon'n ofdiscrimir
nation. It would be unthinkable to
require such selfehatred of any meme
ber of another protected category in
order to be accorded full human digs
nity and status.

In the last two centuries, Americans

have begun to understand that there
are consequences to holding beliefs
that result in discrimination. Many
religious persons believed that sla-
very—and later, segregation—fit
into God‘s order for human societ-
ies, and they pointed to biblical texts
that upheld their beliefs. Similttr disr
agreements have affected the status
of women. To this day, there are re-
ligious communities that restrict the
roles of women, and their beliefs
might be seen as reasonable and bib-
lically-supported. However, United
States civrl rights laws and the non-
discrimination policy of Grinnell
College are evidence thntAmerlcans
have come to understand that insti-
tutions mustproiect members oftheir
communities from the discriminatory
behaviors that extend froin such be-
llefs.

Professor Baleman upholds the life
and teaching ofMartln Luther King,
Jr., in tidmoitishilrg students that, to
make the world safe for homosexu-
als, they will have to change hearts
and notjust pass laws. We agree that

—Boz‘h Sides

This week with Dave Rude!

This week's column serves as a re»
hullal lo Ben’s column last week
dealing with Newt Gingrich‘s ethi-
cal “problems."

Just as I don’t know whether Newt
Gingrich deliberately gave the eth-
ics committee false information or
not, I do not know whether Ben
Patrick deliberately spouted false-
hood aftei' falsehood last week,
Whether he is simply attempting to
demonize Newt, or simply c0nvey~
mg the idea from a skewed media
source is unclear, but luckily I can
fix at least a few of the errors.

First, the earlier column states that
Newt was ﬁned $300,000 for mrse
use ofa “non-profit" group’s funds,
This is inaccurate. Newt was found
guilty of glvrng inconsistent Inf-OF

states that funds
from GOPAC
would be used in
connection wlth his
college course while another one said
that they would not be.

Nowhere does the ethics commit-
tee statc that the funds were used in-
approprtately, rather the report Says
that a document that Newt signed
stated something that was incorrect.
The committee did not even find him
guilty of intentionally lying to the
committee, an issue on which the
committee did not rule either way,

If Newt had been found guilty of
misuse of “non-proﬁt" funds, Newt
would no longer be in Congress, but
rather possibly in prison, This is
because the very ﬁrst item on the
Contract for America passed by the
GOP two years ago was the Congres-
Sional AccountabilrtyAct, an act that
forces congressmen to follow the

 

hearts need to be changed. AS our
colleague noted, laws alone have not
alleviated racism, and laws alone did
not stop lynching. But Dr, King and
others believed that, while laws can-
not make whites love blacks, until
they do, we still need laws against
lynching It is not a matter of laws
alone—but laws and antiediscrimie
nation policies are essential guaran-
tees ofcquality and justice in a world
conﬂicted by all forms of Inhospi-
table, inhumane beliefs. Grinnell
College has, in this current situation,
another opportunity to demonstrate
its commitment to the tradition of
“justice for all" in which it has so
proudly stood.

In closing, we want to express how
disturbing it was to read charges of
“Silencing" and “intolerant" directed
at GLBT persons and their support.
ers, We could not read admonishr
ments that they be nicer to those who
diminish their humanity withoutaskr
ing, how‘would such reproof be
heard if it was directed at African
Americans in the 19605 or at women
in the 1970‘s? Gay, lesbian, bisexual,
and transgendered people are human

beings who have suffered innumer-
able forms of hostility, abuse, and
exclusion. They are not only entitled
to stand up for their rights; they are
to be commended, defended, and
joined in the courageous expression
of their collective voice, They “come
out" at great risk, and when debates
like this rage, it is easy to see why
they are reluctant to identify them-
selves publicly. Wc stand with them
in solidarity, and we urge that col-
lege policies continue to oppose
granting status to anyone or any
group who would discriminate
against them.

say just one thing: wow. the sym-
bolic showing of solidarity by many
people on this campus in support of
the request for space has our admi-
ration. While many ofthe Men Who
Stuff Their Crotches participated in
the event, some did not get the
chance. Yet, they were still with us
in Spirit,

For those of us who were there, a
strange, mystical experience oc—
curred. While all of the Men Who
Stuff Their Crotches were wonder-
ing what the line of hand—clasped
Grinnellians would do if "YMCA"
suddenly, started playing, we sud-
denly enjoyed an illuminating feel-
ing of the collective power of this
campus, All at once, visions ofhun-
dreds of thousands of dollars of
trustee funding for DISCO started to
dance through our Brut fragranced
heads. We envisioned trustees re»
quired to meet in the finest fashions
ofthe 19705; another addition to the
Science Building to be established
in order to further study of the
hedonist’s science; and, every day
would be a DISCO day, Suddenly,

laws they pass upon everyone else.
Before then democrats had never al-
lowed a provision removing their
immunity form their own laws.

The $300,000 ﬁne was not even a
punitive action. The ethics commitr
tee chose that number as a good re-
flection of the amount of tax-payer
dollars used in the investigation. This
seems perfectly reasonable to me, as
it was due to Newt’s negligence that
the process had to take place. A sec-
ond reasonable action (given that this
is not a punitive fin) would be for
Newt to see his own campaign fund
to pay it off. All the ethics commitr
tee wants is for the taxpayers to be
repaid. A third reasonable action
would be forthe ethics committee to
fine David Bonior (the Democrat's
junkyard dog in the House) for all
the wasted taxpayer dollars used to
investigate the 50+ previous ethics
violations that were dismissed.

Newt is taking responsrbility for his
actions. I don‘t see why Bonior
should not have to take responsibilr
ity for his.

OPINION

we were awakened from this sublime
dream by the real reason why we
were there.

Afterwards, the Men Who Stuff
Their Crotches met and concluded
that, for most of us who have had the
previous need, this awakening was
rather like a cold shower. But just
like the memory of what had required
us to bathe in chilled H20, the rev-
elation ofthat day has not left us. Oh,
the things that we can do together as
a campus, even if only joined to-
gether in a common cause for a mo-
ment. .

DISCO is with you, our fellow
Grinnellians. We, the Men Who
StuffTheir Crotches, are only Yodas
in the abyss ofthrs common struggle
We Call college, revealing it to you.
Focus, Grinnelll DISCO will be with
you on March 8th.
