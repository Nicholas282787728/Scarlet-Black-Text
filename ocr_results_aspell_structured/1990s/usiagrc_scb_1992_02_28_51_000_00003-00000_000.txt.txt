PRESIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS

Ison emphasizes utility of past
leadership positions

What do you feel makes you the
most qualiﬁed canidate for SGA
president?

‘ First, I think that one of the tltings
shat makes me most qualiﬁed candi—
date is that I have a lot of leadership
'skills, and a lot ofcontacl with SGA,
and tire related type administrators
and organizations. I don’t think any
‘of the other canadates can say that
ihey’vc been a HAC or editor of the
yearbook or treasurer as wellas stand-
ing on a number ofstanding commit-
tees. In addition to that, I think that
‘what I plan to do with SGA is a lot
better than some of the other plans. I
think some of the ideas that other
pandidates have brought up are good
ideas, and need to be looked into. but
'I think some things like making SGA
morevisible and moreinteractivewith
the students. Someone I was talking
‘to the other day said, the only place
where you getcontact witlt SGA now
is in the bathrooms, when you’reread-
ing the minutes. And I think that that
needs to be changed so that you get
ghat contact but you also get one-on-
one contact with your senators doing
senator study breaks, or something
like that more often. Also, acouple of
ideas that have come up are having
SGA take over some things that stu-
dents take for granted such as the
shuttle to Des Moines and Chicago,
'and maybe starting up a shuttle ser-
ovice on weekends to Iowa City.

'What do you forsee as the most
important issues facing SGA?

I think that it would mostly be that
SGA, since it’s the student govem-
ment organization, can't do much
unless we know what the students
think,andacoupleofidcasthatlhave
to get more opinions from the stu-
dents are more open forums—some
thing that hasn’t been pushed this
year; continuing the SGA column in
the S and B—although it was started
this year I don’t think it was fulﬁlled
toitsfullestextent;andpollingpeople
by sending the senators home each
week with one question that they
would need to come back with a
consenses from the dorm. And using
theSGAboardmoreforpolls,andfor
comments.

How will your past contributionsto
the campus aid you in your role as
SGA president?

First, my positions as both a HAC
and yearbook editor have put me in
contact with a lot of students and I
think that that will help me feel more
comfortablearound them andl’llalso
feel as though I know more students,
so I‘llknowmoreoftheiropinions. In
addition to those two positions. and
also my role with SGA, I’ve gotten
involved with the presidents, bodt
Drake and Ferguson. I’ve been in-
volved with the deans of Student Af-
fairs, and even the Trustees, who
very few people have had much con»
tact Willi. Those three are key con-
tacts that the president will need to
keep in contact with. In addition to
that,especially in thepositionofSGA

treasurer, I’ve seen the large amount
of red tape inherent in the SGA sysr
tern, and that can be, not done away
with, but reduced as much as possible
with some of the ideas that I’ve had
and that have been brought up this
year. 1 think too my — I know very
well how SGA works, and how the
good things are good and so we need
to keep them, and how the bad things
need to be changed or modiﬁed. A
prime example is I think that a lot of
the positions in the cabinet are under
utilized and I think that they can be
made more useful to the campus and
the students.

What does SGA lack that you can
provide?

I think in some ways it lacks the
leadership at the top, and it might lack
it next year just because a lot of the
other candidates don’t have the lead-
ership abilities thatI have. One thing
that’s definitely been shown over the
past three years that I’ve been here is
that if you get a president who has
shown him or herself to be a strong
leader. as was the case my freshman
year, you are going to have a very
smoome run SGA that gets a lot of
things done for the students, and does
what the students want them to do.
But then there‘s been other examples
before and during my time where the
president has come in maybe not as
qualified leadership wise, and there
fore isn‘t as capable of leading the

Kyvig vows to surpass previous
:eXpectations for SGA

'What do you feel makes you the
most qualiﬁed candidate for SGA
president?

Well, I’ve been working as Social
'Coordinator this year, and I‘ve man
aged to go past what the bylaws say

my positionshoulddoand do myown
'projects—‘get into things that people
.haven‘t tried to do before. And what
rI think is imponant for SGA is to go

beyond what people expect it to do
‘and go beyond what people have done
_in the past and ﬁnd new areas where

it would be good for SGA to inter-
‘vene.

.What do you foresee as the most
important issues facing SGA?

1 I think the fact that students do f eel
they don'trecognizc what SGA does,
‘I think that if SGA becomes more
.visible in what it does, and asks stu-
dents to get involved is one thing, but
‘also offering them a range of possi-
lbilities where they can getinvolved is

important.

How will your past contributions to
the campus aid you in your role as
SGA president?

I’ve had a lot of experience with lead-
ership, heading up different commit»
tees andprojocts on my own.l‘vealso
learned to work with people and del-
egate responsibility to people. So, I
think that's—SGA works Lhtltwtlyon
a broader base.

What does SGA lack that you can
provide?

I think to a ccnain extent it lacks the
campus’ confidence in what its been
able to do, and I think SGA can bring
in confidence from the campus.
They’d be able to work further in
expanding their base, you know with
programs on campus and expanding
thecampuscommunityoulofGnnncll
and into different places around the
country.

Asidefrom your atingthe Car-
nival, I also noticed that you men-
tioned gettinga professional coun-
selor for the students? How much
of a need do you see for that on
campus?

Well the idea came from a conversar
tion I was having With a friend of
mine who had feltreally neglected by
Student Affairs when she had—she
felt that she should've had someone
professional to talk to, sitting behind
a desk, you know, who knew her
case. And that she wouldn't have felt
she had to leave campus for. I think
with the way people have been feel»
ing this past year, everybody‘s been
feeling more run down, more stressed
out, and there's been a lot of talk
about that. I think if a professional
person was available on campus for
people to go talk to, it might alleviate
some of the stresses that R.A.‘s are
noticing, that Student Affairs is no-
ticing, and SGA notices—and wants
to do something about.

 

Dick voices ability

to create

new

ideas for SGA

What do you feel makes you the
most qualiﬁed canidate for SGA
president?

This year I’m a senator from
Haines. I am a junior, so I’ve been
around fora while. I’m on the ﬁnance
committee which helps control the
money, so I see where the money is
going. As a senator I am part of the
SGA process; I know how it works.
ButI am far enough away from it, not
like a cabinet member or someone
like that who is ingrained in the pro-
cess, so I would come in with fresh
ideas.IwasonJudicialCouncilsopho-
more year, so I learned about that
process. I'm on theNew Student Days
committee so I’m involved in getting
freshmen involved in thecampuscom»
munity. Also, I am a very hard worker,
and I take my job very seriously. I
would take a lot of time and effort to
see that the job gets done right

What do you forsee as the most
important issues facing SGA?

There are a lot of problems, in
general, on the campus. Directly fac—
ing SGA~well, there is the new cof»
fee house. How is that going towork'!
SGAdireetly owns that. It is notmeant
to makemoney, but is it going to lose
money and have to close down? I
want to devotca lot of attention to that
to make sure that it will to be a place
where students can go to hang out and
enjoy themselves.

There is always the parking
policy—students are not happy about
it. I’d like to see something happen

LON

\vidt that to get it either on a single
deriso students would pay just a
flat out twenty bucks40r nothing at
all. So I’ll work with the administrar
tiontotryand get thatmessallstraight-
cried out

There is always the increasing
enrollment. This year we really no-
ticed the increase. Dorms are really
full; there is no such thingas the ideal
class size any more. We either need
to cut back enrollment or build an-
other dorm, and I would rather cut
back on enrollment to keep the popu-
lation down a little bit

There is always the diversity on
campus. I’d like to see more things
like BlackHistory Month. LikeASIA,
there is no ASIA week. The Native
Americans on campus, the Japanese,
the Chinese...ISO, let's make them a
little more prominent on campus to
give everyoneachance to widen their
horizons.

Those are major issues that SGA
can address.

How will your past contributions
to the campus aid you in your role
as SGA president?

Right now I am an athletic trainer
at the PEC, and I see a lot of different
people, and I have to be able to re-
spend to people and to help them out,
and solam usedto listening topeople.
I am a good communicator. Again,
with New Student Days, Ihave prac-
tice getting people involved in cam-
pus events. As a senator I do know
