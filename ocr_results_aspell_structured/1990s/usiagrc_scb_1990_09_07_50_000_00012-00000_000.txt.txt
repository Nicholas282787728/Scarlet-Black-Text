Esldldsen isskeptical regarding his
team’s defense, which has not yet
come together.

“Overall we are a better learn,
but it may not show until later in
the season,” he stated. “We are
solid iii the midﬁeld, but we need
to improve on both ends by the
goals."

Junior Asha Morgan and senior
Kamy Henson provide excellent
depth and experience in goal.
Jennifer Hooper and Nancy Kaiser

lead the defense and will require
the assistance of freshmen full-

backs Gwen Gifford and Jana
Murchison.

Thomas and Jenny Wood return to
the midfield with the fresh addi»
tions of Cindy Harris and Amy
Henderson. Sara Conner, Marta

Coach Eskildsen considers Wil-

Gridders Prepared for
Opener vs. Lake Forest

By Mike Patterson

The Grinnell football team
opens their 1990 season Satur-
day, hosting Lake Forest at
Rosenbloom Field. Despite a
disappointing performance in
last week’s scrimmage against
Upper Iowa. the team is looking
forward to a productive season.

The Pioneers are relying on
their undersized but extremely
quick defensive squad to come
up with the big plays again this
season. Lastyear.itled the con-
ference in pass defense and
forced 32 turnovers. Much of
the team's defensive strength is
in die secondary. Wendell Barr
ber. Rodd Casper, Shannon
Lyons and Ty McGuire are the
likely sinners; all fourare quick.
experienced and hard-hitting.
Sophomore Dayne Haskell is
also expected to contribute.

The linebacking core is also

as strong as it has ever been. Derol
Kobatake. a junior transfer from
Oregon State, joins pre-season
Division 3 All-American Lee
Kraemer and hard-hitting Bob
Reason on the inside, with perenr
nial stand-outs Scott Truesdell and
Chris Wolfgram on the outside.
The success of the defense this
season, though, depends on how
Well the Pioneer defensive line can
stop the run. The line is anchored
byhard-nosed junior KevinKhalcr.
He isjoined up front by Ara Eulbu-
lian. Mike Gallaty, Tarell Rodgers
andZSO pound freshman Atoh Scott,
forming a unit full of potential.
The Pioneer offense shouldalso
provide a lot of excitement this
season despite being dealt a major
blow in Saturday’s scrimmagewith
starting quarterbacklercmy Hawk-
inson sufferinga broken collarbone.
The offense is now in the capable
hands of junior Tim Hyde. The
running backs behind Hyde are

extremely solid. Explosive
sophomore Ted Stanley pro-
vides speed to theoutside. while
juniors John Ahman and Ben
Wallace are solid up the middle
runners. Freshmen Alexis
Jimenez and Martin Grin are
also expected to contribute.

When Hyde looks to pass,
he hasanumberoflargets. Sure—
handed Armando Gilkes is
joined by sophomores Dave
Bloom, Mark Lehman, Joe
McCarthy and Jon Willis as a
widereceiver,whilejuniorSean
O‘Brien and freshman Matt
Mullin will share the tight end
duties.

Preseason All-American
guard Jeff Shook anchors an
offensive line that junior center
Pat Guzik refers to as “tough.
strong and experienced." J oin-

Trounce
Alumni

By Ian Gustafson

The Pioneer soccer season does
not begin ofﬁcially for the men
until Sept. 15, when they will host

Lorimer, and players Bruno Alicke.
Chung Chae, Chris Eimas, Eric

Added to the roster this year
were Jon Klein. Keith Klinger,
Abago Laka, Nanh Lovanh, Alex
Matschiner, Phumelele Mbalo and
Jeff Stadler. Junior Howard Gar-
dos is the starting goalkeeper.

The Pioneers deﬂated Alumni
hopes quickly. as all three Pioneer
goals were scored within the first
six minutes. In a scramble follow-
ing a comer kick, Chae booted in a
quick feed from Fairchlld for a 1—0
lead. A few minutes later, Ian
Lorimer skyed above the defense to
head in a perfect comer kick from
Alieke. Not long thereafter, Greif
