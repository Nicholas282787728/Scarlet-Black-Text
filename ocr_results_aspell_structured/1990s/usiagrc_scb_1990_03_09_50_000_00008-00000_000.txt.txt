Student Salon: A New Grinnell Tradition

By Tom Wickersham

Exciting is the word I find
myself using most alien to
describe the Grinnell Student
Salon.

I've been working on this
with my fellow Art SEPC'erS
and the Art Department since
last semester and now that the
show’s up and the awards have
been distributed, all that is left
to do is to go see the show
again. It's very exciting.

Wednesday evening, in the
lobby or the Fine Arts building,
in the middle of a rain/ice fall,
the awards for painting. creative
art, sculpture, and best in show
were announced. Although it is

not customary to make known
the value of the awards. I am
going to. The prize money
totalled $750.

Excitement was in the air as
a large crowd of students and
faculty braved, the harsh 'weather
to eat cookies and drink bad
punch and to listen to the
statement prepared by Jessica
Rowe, the juror [or this year's
Salon.

Rowe said she enjoyed
judging the show and it was an
enriching experience for her.
She noted the strengths of the
show to be drawings and
photography. “The quality of
the work,” Rowe also states, “is
a tribute to the art faculty,"

 

Congratulations to the Grinnell
College Swimmers on their
Conference victories...

ButI think what makes the
Grinnell Student Salon most
exciting, is its potential. Now
that we‘ve picked up
momentum, the Salon promises
to be quite a fantastic and
exceptional show in the years to untitled
come. It‘s our goal to make the ’ .
Grinnell Student Salon PaS'el,
something that is as much a * ‘ ’

part of Grinnell as New Student William R. Thompson

Days. .
In other words, the Salon untitled
pastel

should be a permanent ﬁxture
that everyone would expect and
look forward to year after year.
The Salon will be displayed
through March l6. And if you
haven’t yet made it to the Fine
Arts building to see the show,
