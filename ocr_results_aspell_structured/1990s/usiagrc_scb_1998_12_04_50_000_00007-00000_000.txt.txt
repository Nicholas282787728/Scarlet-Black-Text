larion ar Grinnell. ““Thc rcrenrion rare is as
ttcmcly low and has gone down,” said Willis,
The peak orbiack srudenrs here was eighr years
ago, he said. In 1990, 100 Ahican Americans
and black inrcmarionai srudenrs, combined,
were ar crinncll, Now, chere are 47 black sru-
denrs.

Willis said rhar rhe adminisrrarion
needs ro increase rhcir reaching our ro black
srudenrs, in order ro ger rhem inreresred in
coming and sraying ar Grinncll, He
recommendc, reinsraring rhe Marrin Lurhcr
King scholarship, rhar rhe abandoned Mania
Ludrchingsdiolarship,whichvmintroduced
in rhe sixties, ro arrraer more black srudenrs.
“The approximat: 3% orblack srudenrs here
is pitiﬁil," said Willis. 7

“The college needs ro live up ro re reputa»
Lion orbeing commirrcd ro diversiry," he said,

“Where admissions goes ro arrracrsrudenre
and how rheyarrracr rhem is die concern," said
zlornikoir, concurring with Willis.

iso spokesperson vivck vcnugopal, ’01,
said rhar few people are aware orrhe supporr
sysrem for mulriculrural srudenrs on campus.
and mar ir needs ro be accenruarcd. “The colr
legeshould seriously consider ir because its loss
iug studcnts.”

“A lor orresourccs for people oreoior are
nor narumlly on campus,” said Liz Lee, '99,
QPOC spokesperson, “It’s very alienating; it’s
nor a place char rosrers care,”

Lingenrelder agreed char a more acrive re-
cruirmenr otpeople chalot is necessary She
and Lee also menrioned rhar ciao issues aren’t
addressed very well here. “We don’t ralk abour
socioeconomic diversiry enough,” said Lee,

Curriculum
and Faculty

A diverse curriculum and raculrywouid help
mulriculrural srudenrs feel more camfartablc
and recognized in rhe communiry, said many
parricipanrs. Lee believes that rheschool should
give more handing to acquiring racuiry orcolor
andan improved curriculum. Forcxamplc, she
said mar rhe college should commir to keeping
Africana snidies and Gender andWomcn Stud-
ies curricula.

“The college has re make a commirmenr
ro a curriculum ordiversiry, nor ro diversirying
curriculum," she explained.

ZlotnikoFfwas aiso criricai or“conservarive
curriculum," saying rhar the special ropics
courses should be parr of rhe core courses.
Lingcnrelder agreed rhar academies lacked rhe
diversiry shed like ro see, while conversely, she
said char gay issues are well—addressed on cam»
pus.

sGAsrudenr group liaison Jocelyn Prcwirr,
’99, said rhar rhe number offaculty, srair and
adminisrrarors orcolor is very disappointing.

“The lack orcourses oircrcd in areas rhar
focus on people orcoior, me lack orresources,
and rhe lack ofsuppon sysrcms for srudeno or
color are areas in which I think the college des-
perarely needs co improve,” she said.

Venugopal also advocated more faculty or
color and a “globalization" of die curriculum.

The Divoo Forum
and SGA

While some members orme mulriculrural
groups relr encouraged by SGA’s receprivcness
in she forum, orhers were skepricai abour how
much SGAwill be able ro help rhem. Asvmlis
described, “it was a start,"

zlornikoir, Knplan, Lingenreldcr, Kiragawa,
SOL spokesperson Nicolas D. schapira, ’01,
ASIA represenrarive Emily Chan, ’00, and 150
vice-presidenr Lambis Konsranrinidis, '01,al1
srrsssed rhc imporrance ofSGA approaching

rho issues going on. Rice agreed. bur expressed
some skepricism abour how much SGA will be
able ro help. Chan rclr campus mulriculrural
groups could conrribure ro SGA‘s errorrs.

“It’s SGA’s responsibiliry ro reproenr us and
we have ro give inpur, bur rhey need ro do some-

rhingalso," said Chan.

SGA srudcnr group liaison Jocelyn prewirr,
99, said rhar as liaison, she will rake sreps ro en—
sure rhar rhe relarionship berwecn SGAand rhe
srudenr organilations be runcrionai and produo
rive ror all parties involved.

The SGA’s power, l<laersch said, comes from
rheir abiliry ro dererminewhar rhe campus wanrs
and ler people who have rhe power so change

As Prcwitt nored, “iv/1e do nor have rhe ule
rimare say in whar happens. bur we can inlluc
ence rhe decisions rhar rhe adminisrrarion
makes."

“The call tor acrion is really clear,” l<lacrsch
said. “The speciﬁc aerions ro be raken are some

and recruirmenr and rerenrion orsrudenrs.

“SGA acricn will happen," he said, adding
rhar no one is our orrhe realm ofdoing mings.
“The poinr is rhar everyone’s more involved
now," he said. "Everyoncon campus shouldsrill
be addressing diversity issues."

“The forum makes for a decenr launching
poinr," he asserrcd.

Community

Many speakers menrioned how rrusrraring
iris tor rhem ro feel that rhcy musr rake ir upon
themselves to “cducatc the whole campus," as
Kirapwa said.

As Venugopai pur ir, "The SGA is the big»
gesr campus organization. Theres no berrer way
ro educare rhe campus bur through rhem," Ad-
dirionally, he and Mllis hoped rhar an open ro.
rum will be on the agenda soon.

Siclinda Canty—Elliott, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs, said that the tcnsions on cam»
pus conrribured ro bringing abour Divco in
1994, “to look at Lites: issues and create dialoguc
on campus. " She said that the edumtion of the
campus body, as opposed to reaction, is Crltlml.

“Each of us has to be constantly educating
the campus to create a safe environment after
[he walks and talks are over," sh: explained.

“We want m: whole campus to understand
that groups fccl silcnced in different ways; peoplc
are achctcd in different ways,” said Zlotnikoft’.
Venugopal, Schapira, Kapian, Chan and
Kitagawa at: also concerned about this and thc
“burn-out” that members can easily feel, which
ran evtn take away from their academic motiva-
rion,

“People pur in rime, energy. errorr and ir gers
you frustrated to think, ‘goddamn it, nobody
mics?” said Schapira. Ideally, he said, the fa-
rum will sctve as a means through which they
can rcach a wider audience, mus avoiding their
constant rtpclltlon of the issues.

“My basic feeling is that cvcryonc on cam»
pus has a responsibility to make this a Comfort»
able cnvironmcnr for everyone," Kaplan said.
“W: want to 5:: more than just multicultural
students involved, We suggest mat people come
to multicultural events and meetings, or email
us,

“Moreso than doing anything tangiblc, tak:
a look at yourself and what you’re doing to
deconstruct your own racism and homophobia,"
recommended Lingenfcldcr. “Racism and ho»
mophobia are cveryone’s problem,"

The qucstion ofwhy experimenting on rat: is
such a big deal was raised by several biology
srudenrs. “I jusr killed a frog for my bio class
yesrerday i really don’r see rhe difference,
and I just don'r undersrand why people rhink
rhis is a big deal."

A few srudonrs have much srronger reac.
tions. Rachel L|b€mmm '01 sent a letter to
rhe sscb cxpressrng concern with rhe experi-
mentation. ‘

Sara Barr, ’01, thinks good may result from
rar experimcnrarion. “I rhink animal research
is a necessary evil. As long as the animals are
treated well, I think its alright. . there are also
a lot of things [students} can learn [with the
lab],
