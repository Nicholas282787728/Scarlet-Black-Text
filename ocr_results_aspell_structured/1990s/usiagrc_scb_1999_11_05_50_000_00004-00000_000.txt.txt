Book Review: Brown’s Requiem

By Joseph Michaels
Sloff Columnist

Disappoinrmcnr. n. 1. An evenr,
rhing, or person rhar tails ro fulﬁll ones

expccrariono. 2, A feeling ordisrress or
vcxation resulringrrom failure, 3. Brown's
Requiem.

Okay, granred rhis book has an im
pressive acr ro follow. Brown's Reyniem is
rhe sixth novel l'vc read by James Ellroy.
rhe masrer or brural inrrigue and suse
pense. This novel is preceded by Killzr
an r/ae Road LA Coioidenriiiz, T/yc Bias/e
Dania, diminished/igloo and Wires/ace,
Thar said, l had rarher high erpecrarions
which, sumce ro say, were nor mer (see
dermirion no. 1).

The basic problem was one ofcomr
parison. Had Broil/723‘ quzlrtm been rhe
hrsr Ellroy novel 1 had read, 1 would have
undoubredly been more pleased wirh ir.
his an excellenr inrroducrion ro hlswrltr
ing sryle or direcr prose coupled with
graphic imagery. However, rhc sicko in
me was just nor sarished. lwanred gore
and bruraliry on par wlth his orher nov.
els and all I gor was rhc Disneyland vet»

sion. orcourse, I'm well on my way ro
complore desensitization and rhis is due
in a large parr ro Ellroy’s novels. Ofthe
orhei- rive novels orhis rhar I’ve read, rhrce
orrhem made me wanr ro rhrow.up and
rhe orher rwo were nor rhc proverbial
walk in rho park. BmwrzUtequiem. how.
ever, is an extremelycasy read (almost in-
ruriaringly so) and ir rarely comes any.
where close ro rhc graphic narurc othis
orher, larer novels. lnsread oracrually de.
scribing a scene, Ellroy‘s narraror simply
srares rhar rhe scene is horrible, and moves
along wirh plor. This lack ordescriprion
easily aecounrs ror rhe shorrer lengrh of
rho book as opposed ro his larer novels.
The plor oirhe novel is equally diy
appoinring by comparison. If you are
expccnng an inrricare, lntet»woven plor
wirh ﬁne subrleues, you mighr as well
rorger abour ir. The plor, revolving
around a privare invesrigaror/rcpo man
who is rrying ro rurn his life around, is
nor compelling and fairlyslraiglltfonvard.
The characrers are not nearly as complex
as rhey need ro be in order ro be lntngue
lug. lnsread, Ellroy has wrirren rhe life
and rimes or several criminals and mix»

hrs, bur has failed ro give his characrers
real personalirics. .

Music is a symbol so blaranr rhar ir
,usr becomes annoyingarrcrawhile. For
some reason, everybody in rhe book is
enamoured orgrear “classiml” music, and
rhis music helps rhe characrers ralionalr
izc rhcir exisrsnce. Rubbish. What
should be suhrle imagery is presenred as
a gaudy neon sign rhar rhe reader rires of
qulckly.

Despirc all rhis,13i-owniReoiiim is a
run read. Maybe I’m iusr burnr out on
all rhese books rhar engage my mind and
I iusr needed a simple read or maybe i
will always have a special place for James
Ellmy on my reading lisrs. Either way,
rhc book was a muchmccdcd relief,

The problem wirh rhe book basically
boils down ro this; Brim/n} Requiem is
Ellray's freshman ouring, and ir shows.
Elltoy begins ro cxperimenr with rhe
sryles rhar will pay orrin his larer novels
bur are now just in rheir iledgling srages.
Having read his larer, superior novels ﬁrst,
in Emmi Requiem ir seems as rhough
Ellroy is just going rhrough rhe morions
wirhour reaping any or rhe benehrs his
larer novels reap.

I’ll Hold the Coke, You Hold the Talking

By Courtney Houghom and
Aaron Stockhom
Sloff Columnisls

Don’t we all need a lillle recov-
ery rime arrer that crazy Halloween
weekend? If it’s nor scary movies,
it’s taking little kid’s candy, and that
just tuckets us out, Courtney thinks
she is now dearin her righr ear trom
shooring her damn cap gun all night.
No one really understood Aaron's
cosrume, but that's OK. At least he
tries. Well, suprisingly this week
SGA has gorren a prerry big summer
hlt. Ofcauts: we also have the Stan»
dard movie that no onc has ever
heard of to balance things out. AI-
ways good ro ger righr back mm rho
routine after such a fun wcekcnd.
Now for our regularly scheduled
program...

if my high school experience was
vasrly different from rhe norm, bur
I never made a pacr wirh my bud-
dies ro score before prom. sure, ir
was on everybody’s minds, bur we
didn't go around vocalizing ir. Aside
from rhar, I rhoughr ir was funny in
a Somerhing Abour Mary way...all
sorrs ordirry jokes like rhar.

c: Well, since I absolurcly did
nor like There's Somelhlng About
Mary, I'm sure rhar I will love rhis
one roo. Iriusrweirded me our rhar
