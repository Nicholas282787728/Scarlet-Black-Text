Who, us?--Prejudiced?

This week, several assaults occurred on campus. Students innocently
walking on South Campus were the brutal victims of thugs who did not
belong here. Students reported to both Student Affairs and the Grinnell
Police Department that they had had bottles and rocks thrown at them, had
been verbally assaulted, and had been pushed and kicked. Our very own
territory hadbeeninvaded,andonecould noteven feel safewalking from one
side of campus to another.

Admit it. As the rumors of the attacks flew from the classroom to the post-
ofﬁce to the library. your ﬁrst reaction was to wonder what those “townies”
were doing. Automatically, the attackers were perceived not only as people
who "don't belong here," but as people from town, out to harass college
students by calling us racist, sexist,
homophobic names, and threaten-
ing us with with baseball bats.

Then on Monday night, much to
everyone’s surprise, the Grinnell
Police Department arrested three
juveniles from the town of Brook»
lyn, Iowa in connection with the
assaults.

Yes, just as many local townspeople may stereotype us as "different," so
do many of us tend to stereotype them. We do not like to admit it, but many
of us have preconceived ideas about the people we call “townies.” The
townspeople recognize our stereotypes as well, as this week‘s feature on
town—gown relations shows. We should not assume that every citizen of
Grinnell would like to physically harm college students

This week's series of incidents serves to remind us that for some of us.
stereotypes of townspeople linger and can make us feel more like "it’s us
against them." Until we begin to re-think our attitudes toward our environ-
ment. relations between students and townspeople will not improve. If we
constantly believe that there is an underlying conﬂict between the town and
the college, then we will act as if there is a conflict, and one will exist when
one does not have to.

Just something to think about.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students label Spectator In search of the
article "harassment"

To the editor,

The following is an open lower to
author of Grinnell Spectator “obser-
vation" on Maria Mootry:

As members of the MultiEthnic
Coalition, we feel compelled to m,
spondto Lhe“observation"regarding
Maria Mootry that appeared in the
Grinnell Spectator on September 20,
Why was Maria Mootry targeted?
Clearly,shedidnotviolatcaGrinnell
policy regarding professorial lane
guagc in class. No such policy exists.
So why was Professor Mootry tar-
geted? In other words, shedocs not fit
your standards ofprofessonalbchav-
ior. She is not white. She is not of
European descent. We believe that
this “observation“ is racist and there-
fore a fortn of racial harassment.

Harassment is defined in the
Grinnell College Student Handbook,
p. 90-91, as any “form of conduct
which has the purpose or effect of
creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive environment for a student,
faculty, or staff member. . .and. . .
affects the general well-being and
workperformanceofa faculty or staff
member." We believe that the “ob-
servation" constitutes a formof mali-
ciousridiculeordisparagement,"that

has been placed in “written,graphic,
or other form in any publication,"
namely the Grinnell Spectator. Due
to youraccusationprintcdin theSpEc—
tutor, we believe Professor Mootry‘s
wellrbeing on campus, as well a her
career at Grinnell College or at any
other institution, have been jeopara
dizcd.

We strongly urge the administra-
tion of the college to take action based
on theirown harassmentpolicy. Your
statements haveinsidiouslyinfringed
upon an individual’s freedom of ex-
pression, which is fundamentally
bound to her race. You have imposed
your Eurocentric values onto Maria
Mootry. The implications of this are
f ar-reaching and dangerous: that any
non-Euroccntric viewpointlacks ar—
ticulation, and ultimately pollutes the
dominantculture. We, as members of
the MultiEthnic Coalition, are
strongly committed to
Multiculturalismithe expression of
voices notemanating out of the domi-
nant culture, and strongly oppose the
perpetuation of “observations“ such
as the one printed in the Grinnell
Spectator.

To the editor,

In the past two weeks, the college
has given students the following two
messages:

1. "Dirty dishes left in kitchens on
Monday will be removed on Friday
and cannot be retrieved."

2. "Monday evening, September 30,
there was a group of older teens (17-
21 years), male with possibly one
woman, and a dog, who assaulted at
least one student and threw rocks at
others."

The first message announces that
my dishes left only on Monday will
be removed and makes no mention of
what would happen to my dishes left
on Tuesday through Thursday. Isup»
pose they receive a a worse fate. The
second one wants me that I am in
danger of being assaulted by a dog
that throws rocks.

As a college that prides itself on
teaching students to write well, why
can the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs and
the Director of Housing not do the
same?

DINOSAUR DAYS
Road between the lines

Alice was last weekend, and this
weekend I plan to reread Thomas
Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49. I
firster the book in England, where
my distance from (and my affinity to)
America forced me to evaluate thc
country (and thc novel) with my own
experienccsinmindrliere's theplug:
get off campus and read something
which will alter your perceptions of
the world which we inhabit. There’s
no need to go abroad to do so. Do we
suffer so dearly in our ivory towers of
academia that we cannot suppress
that ever present guilt factor associ-
ated with ”pleasure reading"?

Certainly the idea of reading a
book may seem a far less exciting trip
for the imagination than a beautiful
afternoon atClevelandPlaza,butgive
theStewartLibraryintownawhirlJf
nothing else, it’s a nice walk.

Try The Crymg ochl 49. Written
in 1966, the book is aging, but its
senttmcntsarestillintriguingandrel»
evant in today’s socicty. Vinelond is
the latest work by this author, yet I
still recommend the shortcr novel.

Pynchon’swonderlandiscontem-
porary America, an equally curious
and yet much more real world within
its illusions than that which Alice
encountered beyond the rabbit’s hole.
When I glanced through the newspa-
per Monday morning at Eurling, my

Ann
Treistman

mindagain ﬂashedbacktoPynchon's
literature. Is this some sort of bizarre
plan to gct tne into Pynchon orjust
coincidence? Paranoia is a major
theme in Crying, especially as it is
contrastedthreligiouscxpcncnces,
i.c. do moments of revelation truly
occurordoourminds merely project
them?

The story begins simply. Ocdipa
Maris is named executor of her ex-
lover Pierce Inverarity’s will. With a
name like Oedipa, we might expect
mutthis will bea dctectivestory, with
clues culminating in a final answer.
ButinPynchon’sSanNarSiscthings
arc not as they appear.

As Oedipzt stumbles overclue upon
clue, studying Inverarity’s holdings
in what develops into a search for
some unspecified moment of recog—
nition, the mystery intensifies. There
are no clearanswers. She worries that
sheistmaginingitall,espcciallyafter
oncintcnsentghtwhereeventhebath-
room walls of a random club reveals
more hints. Half the people in the bar
are in drug, so Oedlpa is further dis»
placed.

Hcr psychiatrist, Dr. Hilarius, is

no help at all. He phones Oedipa in
the middle of the night, urging her to
take LSD; he is giving the drug to
all the housewives that he treats as an
experiment. As wemove further into
the underbelly of San Narsisco, our
perceptions are tcstcd along with
Oedipa’s.

Rather than go through the book, I
urge you to read it. Orany contempo-
rary piece that catches your interest
as you peruse the shelves. You’ll be
surprised at how much a good book
can open your mind.

Pynchon’s America is alive and
well. In the Wall Street loumal on
Monday, one of the front page ar-
ticles dealt with a little advertised
airline. Nicknamed Con Air. the Air
Operations DivisionofU.S. Marshals
Service carries criminals, The plrtncs
are painted with blue stripes and the
passengers don'tget up when the seat
beltsign is turned off.In fact,the seat
belt sign is never turned off. Every-
one is chained into their seats.

The morcI learn about this counr
try, the less I understand. That’s why
I read. Because unless you begin to
see through others’ eyes, you never
realize what you don’t know. And
who wants to go through life thinking
that they know everything?

Go to the library. Before it’s too
late,“
