‘Disco Fever’ Breaks Out

By Konstantinos
Kambouroglou

AST Saturday night in the
I Harris Center the fourth se
quel of Dico Fest took place.

The party had a very big tumout.

Early in theaftemoon, the Harris
Center started undergoing a meta-
morphosis.By 10:00pm leopardskin
would be covering the ceiling and a
giant cage would be standing right in
front or the concert hall's stage.
Things were looking quite shiny: the
Men Who Stuff Their Crotches were
back in town.

About half a dozen alums, rer
tun-ted to campus last weekend, to
carry on what is anymore a tradition
ofDiscoparties. As they commented,
the idea is really very simple. “The
seventies was avery ugly, very funny
period in recent history. Disco is part
of our childhood and the whole im-
age of that era offers a great atmo-
sphere for artyone to have a great
time. We want to let the party do the
talking."

The party was a great success.
and itproved thatDisco Fest isoneof
the most popular partyethemes on
campus. The decoration was unprec-

edented: leopard skin hanging from
the ceiling gave the Harris Center a
certain seventies kitch air. A more
flamboyant attraction was the big
square cage in which panicrs could
climb and feel like home backrinr
the-seventies.

The people who attended the
party were no less decorated than the
concert hall. Polyester, grotesque
sideburns, bell bottoms, lots of gold,
shiny shoes, voluminous aims and
sleazy grins. Absorbed in intense
people-watching, a certain disco-
freak exclaimed “they‘re all so beau-
tifuI!”

The feeling of disco-groovin’
was overwhelming in the HarrisCenv
ter last Saturday, bringing to
Grinnell’s campus a drastically dif—
ferent note in weekend recreation.
Certain people discovered this kind
of party for the first time; others got
their annual dose (or overdose) of
disco, while a {cw left Harris wone
dering how the seventies could possi

is a very complicated question to
address away from the dance floor,
especially inthemiddleofFerbruary.
when polyester is way too cold to
walk around in, alternative rock is

Harlow speaks on negotiating
power in a changing world

By Kendra Ford

HIS week the Noun Program
T in Women’s Studies, in con

junction with the Humani-
ties Division, broughtProfessor Bar-
bara Harlow to campus. Ms. Harlow
spoke in several settings about the
experienceofwomcnaspoliticalprise
oners, their means of survival and
resistance, and the path from resis—
tance movements to becoming viable
members of the political sphere.

Ms. Harlow spoke on Wednes—
day afternoon about the situation in
Ireland. At convocation she focused
on Ireland, and also spoke of the
implications the Maastricht Treaty
has on Europe as a whole. She ex
tended the discussion of the treaty
into a comparison with the. also re-
cently ratified, NAFTA. Harlow
charged that both treaties are trying
to restructure the hemispheres, “to
retake the globe. "

On Wednesday evening Harlow
told stories about political prisoners
in Ireland. Harlow drew parallels
between the US and Ireland by ex-
plaining that there are political pris-
oners in the US as well. She referred
to Susan Rosenburg, a revolutionary
political activist, who has been given
a 56 year term for possession; while
murders and rapists are sometimes

released after sewing only a few
years.

Harlow used the struggles in he
land as an example for how power
games work allover the world: in El
Salvador, in Palestine, in South Ai-
rica. She spoke of Irish men and
women hold in British prisons for
anti»British activities and about the
struggles of Irish groups to become
part of the negotiations with the Brit—
ish to end the fighting.

The movement from armed
struggle to negotiation goes through
theprisons.explainedHarlow.When
the people active in resistanceare in
prison, the only discourse is interro-
gation, prisoners learn to guard their
speech. When the interrogator and
the prisoner meet again around the
negotiating table they must releam
their methods of communicating.
Harlow observed that the negotiating
table gives power back to the pris-
oner and that, “acquiring power is
almost as problematic as giving up
some".

Women prisoners in Northeni
Ireland have been protesting strip
searches, and have managed to gain
wide publicity about these atrocities.
Harlow read poems from women in
these prisons, several of which were
responses to the horror of the strip
searches. These searches are another
exampleoftheappalling methods the

dominant power uses to instill [car
and obedience. The loop hole in the
system, Harlow pointed out, is that
when women experience such de»
grading searches they develop great
solidarity and methods of communi-
cation which unden'nine the British
authority.

It is not only Irish prisons which
enact strip searches, the American
prison system makes a regular prac~
tice of it. Harlow cited letters from
Rosenburg in which she said she had
been stripped searched some 18,000
times in her few years in prison.

Harlow also spoke to an Enr
glish class about a Etel Adrian's, Sin
MarieRore .a book aboutawoman's
experience in war torn Beruit.
Harlow has taughtin Egypt and Ire-
land, giving her wide experience in
areas of the world involved in social
and political struggles; she is a lead-
ing scholar on the role of literature in
liberation movements. She is cur-
rently teaching at the University of
Texas-Austin.

Each of Harlow's talks empha-
sized the difftculties of power rela-
tions in this world of renegotiating
nationalidentitiesandboundaries,and
individual human rights. Harlow has
recently publishedBARRED .' Women.
Writing, and Political Detention in
which she discusses all of these issue
at length.
