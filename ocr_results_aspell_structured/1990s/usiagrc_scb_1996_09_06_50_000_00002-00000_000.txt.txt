These changes in Grinnell
College’s Fine Arts facilities will ob-
viously come too late for current se-
niors. a fact which Mr, Czechowskl
acknowledges as “too bad for the stu-
dents who zire leavrng but an incred-
ible improvement for us and other

students." Citing the positive differ-
once these additions and renovations
will make in classes and cocurricular
activities, Mr. Czechowski attested to
the general mood of Grinlicllians in»
volved in the arts: “1 know
everybody’s very excited."

IES Utilities installs new
transformers on campus

By DAVID BURNETT
Staff \Vriter

Over the summer the Grinnell
College campus underwent solrtc
cosmetic changes. Grinnell is now
adorned with over 20 green, metal
boxes from {ES Utilities which rlmgc
in size from appt‘oxiamalely 3' x 2’
x 3' (length. width, height) to 5' x 3'
x 6‘, These ﬁxtures are very visible
because they are located above
ground throughout the campus. In
addition to the first warning Sign, the
boxes also have a label which reads,
“Please do not put shrubs or other
Objects within six feetoftliis ﬁxture."
We are not supposed to put “shrubs
or other objects” Within six feet of
the boxes, but some are located less
than three feet away from Sidewalks.
Due 10 this fuel, some Grinnell stu-
dents have expressed concern about
safety of those fixtures,

left Haley, the Area Manager
for IES Utililles, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. “They are (lei-1r
nitcly not dangerous" Haley also
explained that there tire actually two
different kinds of fixtures thlit were
installed at Grinnell over the sums
liter. Thc lltrgcr ones which arc near
dorms are actually transformers, lintl

the smaller ones which ltrc spread
ihroughoul the campus are SW11Cllr
ing pedestals. Neither fixture is don.
gerous as long as no one tampcrs
With it. Both the transformers and
the swuching pedestals are
grounded so they do not pose it
threat to the safety ofGrinncll slur
dents,

According to Hnlcy, the trans-
formers and switching pedestals
have warning labels as a precaution
to keep children from playing on the
fixtures. The fixtures are safe to
touch on the exterior, but the want-
ing labels are meant to prevent
people from tryiltg to get inside
them. Tile labels are specifically
aimed at children with the hope that
the warning Will totally deter any-
one fi-oin imnpcrlng with Ihc fix-
lines.

The new transformers ltlld
swtlching pcdcstllls were installed
ovcr the summcr. btlt Grinnell has
had these types of fixtures formally
years, but they were stored inside
buildings in the basements Tllc
outdoor fixtures were lllcd be-
cause they free up indoor pit and
are eaSler to use and rep r. The pur.
pose oflhe transformers is to clililigc
the high voltage (\I the current that

IES Utilities sends to Grinnell to a
lower, lnore usable voltage. The
switching pedestals are used to re-
route electricity from one under-
ground cable to another for safety rea-
sons in case of underground digging.
Both types of fixtures are located
above ground for accessibility reasons
in case they need to be repaired, or in
case the switching pedestals need to
be used

The new ﬁxtures were installed
as ajoiut effort of both IES Utilities
and Grinnell College. According to
Mr. Haley, the switching pedestals
cost around $285 each. and the [IiillSr
foniicrs range front $4,000 to $8,000.
IES Utilities and Grinnell College
shared the cost of purchasing and in-
stalling the new fixtures, The new
transformers and switching pedestals
will actually save money in the long
run because they will be cheaper and
easier to access, and the new trans-
formch will convert the higher lES
voltage to the lower, usable voltage
more efficiently

Although it may seem as ifthc
new tl‘ansfonners and switching peds
eslnls are only dangerous cycsores, in
fact, these new additions to the
Grinnell campus are not dangerous
but economical.
