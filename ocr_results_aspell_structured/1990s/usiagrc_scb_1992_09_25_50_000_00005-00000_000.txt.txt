Let It Rot! : EAG and FIG begin composting

by Miles Stern

After achieving great success in
organizingthecollegereeyclingpror
gram, EAG (Environmental Action
Group), in conjunction with FIG
(Farming Interest Group).began fore
mulating plans for the CAMPUS
COMPOSTENGPROLIFERATION
CAMPAIGN at EAG’s firstmeeting
of the year. In order to start the
proliferation of information, this brief
overview of the magical process was
prepared.

What is compost?

According to the great guide book
Leterotl, written by Stu Campbell,
“compostcomesh-omtwoLatinroots.
one meaning ‘together'.andtheother
meaning ‘to bring’." Compost eon-
sists of organic wastes like carrot
peels, banana skins, milk, leaves,
crackers, and ﬂowers and other com-
mon garbage all mashed together and
processed by natural bacteria and
other creatures into a mucky and most
extraordinary fertilizing material.
Pretty neat and easy. eh?

How is composting done?

The actual production of the stuff is
rather simple and only requires a
special spot, an outﬂow of wastes,
some turning of the pile, and patient
people. By dumping plant wastes
and other degradable materials intoa
special compost hole, wooden box,
or other container, and letting the
mixturerot,compostisformed. When
done correctly, the mixture does not
stink or attract animals contrary to
certain silly myths.

Why compost?

Campbell explains, that garbage can
be classified into three groupings:
”1) desirable composlable stuff, 2)
undesirable compostable stuff, and
3) non-biodegradable stuff." By

composting the materials that fit into
the first category (nearly all foods,
plant materials, and non-synthetic
fibersamong other things), less waste
finds its way into landfills or other
trash centers. This massive percent-
age ofwaste is then given back to the
earth as compost fertilizer. Also,
many recyclable materials from the
non-biodegradable materials can also

be saved from entering the solid waste
stream, In other words, composting,
togetherwith recycling, can help grow
plants and reduce the tremendous
amounts of trash in landfills.

Whatare EAG and FIG doingwitlt
composting?

The two groups will be working over

the next few months to introduce
compostingtotheoffvcampushouses,
the dormitories, and then perhaps to
dining services, and eventually to the
restofthe Grinnell community (have
no fear, the town no longer prohibits
composting). EAG and FIG will
begin their ﬁrst compost heap at an
OCCO house within the next few
weeks before things get too cold.

Everyone is invited to contribute
compostablematerials once the heap
is smed. Formoreinfonnationabout

materials are compostable, please
