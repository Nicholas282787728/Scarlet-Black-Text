Profs to make Celtic offering for Goodnow

By ANDY HICKEN

S there any academic justiﬁca-
tion for painting yourself blue

and walking across campus,
shouting and making as much noise
as possible?

TheGrinnellAnthropologyDcr
partment would answer yes. Public
nudity is rumored to be a part of a
ceremonial procession celebrating
Anthropology's movement from its
old home in 1217 Park to the tee
cently redesigned Goodnow Hall
that will take place. The
department's needs were not ad-
equately met by 1217 Park, and An-
thropology faculty, staff and stu-
dents are delighted with the move to
the new Goodnow facilities, dc-
signed specifically for Anthropol-
ogy, in.

Goodnow dates back to 1882,
when it was built in the wake of a
cyclone which destroyed all the
college's buildings. (There were
two buildings before the cyclone.)
Originally it was used as a library,
but since being replaced by Burling
in the 19605, It was used ﬁrst for
science offices, then as the home of
the Physics Department, and most
recently as the Psychology head-
quarters.

Associate Professor of Anthror
pology Kathryn Kamp cited the in
adequacy of 1217 Park, a converted
house, as one of the reasons for the
department's move. The house was
too small, and had inadequate lab
facilities. Karrip was “teaching a lab
class in what used to be the dining
room. . ,
room space, and it certainly wasn‘t
lab space."

in addition, anthropology SEPC
chair Stephany Schmidt noted that
the old lab was dIvided in two by it
wall and that 1217 Park had slippcd
six inches offofits foundation in the
last couple of years.

Goodnow will be a signiﬁcant
improvement. Anthropology fac-
ulty Worked with the architect in its
design, and helped create what they

consider one of the most exciting
new additions to the building — a
new archaeology lab. Alsoincluded
in the building are new classrooms,
12 new offices, including six occur
pied by non»Anthropology faculty.
a seminar room, a midsized com-
puterlab(computersarenotinstzilled
yet), and a student project room.

“I'm really happy with
Goodnow. The facilities are so much
better," said Schmidt.

More adequate facilities were
not the only reason Anthropology
was moved into Goodnow. Kamp
says another reason the Anthropolr
ogy Departmentwas given Goodnow
by the college is that the building,
which is on the National Register of
Historic Places, is “the logical place
for the Anthropology Department,
since anthropologists are interested
in historical preservation."

Though the building could not
be restored to its original design
because libraries require different
uses of space than classrooms. the
consulting faculty tried to “make

[the renovation] as historically con
sistent as possrblc," so that balllse
ters, stairwells, wallpaper, curtains.
carpeting and so forth were used that
resembled those used in the nine
teenth century.

Although classes started in the
building as early as lastMonday, the
officrzil moving-in will be tomorrow
at l l :00 am, when, asSchinidtsaid,
“There's going to be a procession
from 1217 Park throughcentral came
pus to Goodnow. and there's going
to be lots of shouting and as much
noise as possible." Schmidt also
mentioned the rumored nudity,
which. she says, is based on the
ceremoniesofan ancientCeltic tribe
from ScotlandcalledthePicts. When
the procession reaches Goodnow,
“we're going to pour cider on the
ground in offering to the great god—
dess. then we‘re going to smash all
of our cups on the front stairs."

Anyone is welcome, Schmidt
said, as long as they bring their own
food, “We don't have enough to
feed a lot of people,"
