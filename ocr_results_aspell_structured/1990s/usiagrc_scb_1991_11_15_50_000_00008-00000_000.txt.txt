Print Study Room exhibits
art from Provincetown

By Jennifer Stukas

_—
For more than seventy-ﬁve years,
Provincetown, Massachusetts has
been thehome andinspimtion of both
famous and anonymous artists of
many different genres. In
“Provincetown and the Art of
Printmaking," a two part exhibition
now being shown in the Prim Study
Room of Burling Library, one can
see a sample of the prints of several
of these artists, ranging in style from
the subtle and abstract “Woman Uri»
dressing," a l987 monotype by Jack
Coughlin, to a 1984 seiigraph by
Andy Warhol, entitled “Venus."
When Provincean became an
unofficial artist’s colony shortly af-
ter the turn of the century, the typical
medium used was the singlerblock
color woodcut, known as the
“Provincetown Print,” invented by
BiJiO. Nordfeldt. A woodcut by
Nordfeldt, entitled “The Dory"
(1916), shows a stiff-ﬁgured pastel
scene of a fisherman and his boat

set off from each other by white conr
tour lines. making the work seem as
primitive yet distinct as Cloisonne.
Works made with the same technique
by other early settlers to the colony
are also displayed, and it is interest-
ing to see the contrast between these
early woodcuts and a l938 color
woodblock print, “This Joint is
Jumpin’," by William H Evaul, Jr,

Among the more dynamic works
in the show is a large lithograph and
collage by the consistantly lively Red
Grooms (“Lorna Doone,” 1979-80)
showing a caricamred leopard—skin

interesting is Alexander Rattner's
Fauve—inspired lithograph “Still-life
withOystcrs" (1950’s). Andof course
there is the striking and ﬂamboyant
Andy Warhol.

The first installment of
"Provincetown and the Art of
Printmaking" will be on display in
the Print Study Room in the Hurling
basementuntil November 27th. The
second half of the show will go up
December 4th.

SCARLET & BLACK

Legendary rock promoter Graham, dead
at age 60, had connection to Grinnell

By Georgia Dentel

Bill Graham. rock»and—roll im-
prmio and owner of New York‘s
Fillmore East and San Francisco’s
Fillmore West, rock venues of the
1960‘s and early 70’s, was killed on
Oct 25 in a helicopter accident near
Vallejo, Calif.

Graham had a special connection
to Grinnell College. Before quality
rockrand-roll was available in the
Midwest, i called him to ask if he
would send one of his “up and com-

in g" bands toGrinnell— theJefferson
Airplane.

The band had not yctplayed at the
Fillmore and Graham was somewhat
reluctant to fly it to Iowa for the small
fee we could offer. However, he did
507 and for years thereafter. the Air-
plane noted on its record liner that its
first college concert was played “at
Grinnell College in Iowa"

Later Graham helped Grinnell to
present “live" other emerging anists
who normally would have been far
beyond the limits ofour budget. such

as Little Feat, Otis Redding, and The
Paul Butterﬁeld Blues Band,

Bill Graham was a friend to
Grinnell‘sconcertprogramovermany
years. Students had the opponunity
to experience some of the greatest
anists of the past quarter-century be—
cause of his genorosityi It is appro-
priatethatwc takenoteofhispassing.

Georgia Bertie! is the director of the
Performing Art: Program [1! Grim

Events Program.

Poet B.F. Maiz inspired
audience with his work

By Jennifer Vacchiano

“The voice of the poctis needed in
ourproscrﬂattened world."B.F. Maiz
repeated over and over again these
words by Walter Breugelman last
Thursday night in Main Lounge,
where he “performed" his poetry)

Without manuscript or micro-
phone, Maiziin his booming, pow-
erful voic%reciled poems about the
late Langston Hughes, life experi—
ences in the ghetto, and love, Maiz
gets his inspiration for writing by
listening to jazz music, and his po—
eLryiwhich contains much asso-
nance, alliteration, and repetition—
sounds like jazz.

“Poetry," Maiz explained between

poems, “is the holy art of placing the
elegant fabric oflanguage on factand
feeling simultaneously. in honor and
praise of beauty and truth,” And a
poet, he explained,“is 2t servant to the
human spirit."

Maiz urged the students in the
audience to learn to “master the lan-
guage” while atGrinnell. He stressed
the importance of knowing how to
use language, saying that understand-
ing and utilizing language is a first
step towards liberation. At the end of
the hourheremindcd students.“Make
sure you leave here knowing more
than when you did whenyou anived."

Maiz was inspirational. and his
voice definitely enlivens “our prose-
ﬂattened world.”
