Dr. D. Akiba Sullivan Harper,
, Associate Professor of English at
, Spelman College, brought to Iowa an
, extraordinary knowledge and enthus

- . siasln that made her Special Topic

Course, “Voices and Techniques in
the Works ofLangston Hughes,” par»
ticularly popular among
Grinnellians,

‘ “1 am on a mission," said Harper,
who will remain at Grinnell through
Saturday as the Minority Scholar-Ina
Residence "My great desire is to see
people recognize Langston Hughes
for a lifetime career of achievement

. «in writing."
‘ Harper emphasized that Hughes,
icommonly dubbed the “Shakespeare
i‘Of Harlem," was accomplished in
V' (numerous forms of writing beyond
; ,fpo'etry. Few people, she suggested,
are aware of the stylistic and thematic

readth of his work.

“People often play Hughes too
nail,“ said Harper. “1 want him to
et recognized for the extent and

avarlety of themes and techniques in
tis writing "

Harper, who graduated from

”Oberlin College (B.A.) and Emory
i University (MA. and PhD), became
interested in Langston Hughes in
1971 during a prercollege program
at Hampton University.
This interest evolved into a life»
long career for Harper, who founded
the Langston Hughes Society in 1981

News & FEATURES

and became President ofthe organi-
zation in 1993. She has published
three books and numerous articles
centered on Hughes' life and writing,

In addition, Harper has given lec-
tures and public appearances across
the United States and is affiliated
With six different English and Ian—
guage»oriented societies,

Harper credits her journey to
Grinnell with inﬂuences from three
people. The first two, Grinnellians on
an offecampus study program to
Spelman, were particularly excellent
students in one of her African-
American Literature courses,

The third was Professor of En»
glish Saadi Simawe, who had met
and exchanged syllabi with Harper
through the College LanguageAsso-
clation.

“He was always so involved and
so enthusiastic about Grinnell," said
Harper.

The Special Topic course, which
Harper teaches as a full—semester‘
class at Spelman, focuses on five
genres of Langston Hughes’ work,
Students spend one week studying
poetry, one will! short stories, and
one with the “Simple" stories.

“The ‘Simple' pieces are their
own genre... their own thing,” said
Harper, who has devoted particular
energy to this topic in her books.
Simple was a fictional character
Hughes created and used throughout
many ofhis short stories. Though not
autobiographical, the character often
does represent many of Hughes'

viewpoints,

The class, which in-
cluded sophomoresjunr
iors, and seniors from
many different majors,
also investigated two
plays, some autobio»
graphical material, and
some non-fiction prose.

“Students have indie
cated a close reading,"
said Harper. “The inter-
action is good— I've
been very pleased."

However, the short
duration of the course
has created some frustrar ,_ _, ,
tion and students wish 2
they had more time to
investigate the topic.

“it's a great class," said Heath
Haiverson '98. “I enjoy getting in
depth into one writer. I wtsh it were
a longer coursc though, because I’d
like to have more time to explore
Langston Hughes."

Geoff Brumfiel '00 expressed
similar enthusiasm. “Two big thumbs
up for Dr, Harper!" he exclaimed
“Given the amount oftime she’s had,
she’s taught an excellent Special
Topic coulse."

In addition to teaching her class,
Harper organized a celebration for
Hughes’ birthday and showed a PBS
video entitled “Langston Hughes:
Tile Dream Keeper." She also pre—
sented the February 5 Scholar’s Con-
vocation, which enjoyed a sizable
turnout,

“Dr. Harper is so lively," said
Halverson “Her love of Langston
Hughes is just inspiring,"

One ofl-larpcr's hopes in promot-
ing these activities is that students
will take advantage of the resources
available at Grinnell in order to gain
a deeper appreciation for Langston
Hughes.

Burling Library Carries a variety
of books and periodicals, including
the Langston Hughes Review, to aid
such investigation, and the College
Bookstore has Harper‘s books on

Evaluating

Grinnell:

College Undergoes Reaccreditation

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

cht November Grinnell College
will be visited by a team of Consult»
antrEvaiuators from the North Cenr
tral Association of Colleges and
Schools (NCA) for the purpose of
reaccreditzition. The College admin—
istraiion began preparations for this
evaluation by appointing a Self-
Study Steering Committee in the fall
of 19,96. Self-Study Steering Com-
mittee Chairperson and Professor of
Psychology David Lopalto is conti-
dent about the results.

”There is absolutely no doubt we
will be reaccredited," said Lopatto.
“It’s just a matter of getting it done
by the book." According to fellow
committee member and History Pro-
fessor George Drake, that’s a com-
fort Grinnellians shouldn’t take for
granted.

“Accredited institution degrees
have a prestige that non—accredited
institutions cannot provide,” said
Drake. who also serves as a Consult-
antvaaluator for the NCA. “You‘d
be surprised at what some schools do
to get accredited."

Grinnell‘s standing as a selective
liberal arts school may mean Grin-
nell won‘t have problems achieving
reaccreditation, but it doesn’t mean
the NCA won’t ﬁnd problems with
the program. On the colitrary,
Grinnell’s Standing may cause deeper
study into the School than other
schools of similar Size.

wThe evaluators will follow up the
reports and meet with key members
of the administrations and facility;
perhaps all of the facility," said
Drake, “Many frank questions are
asked. If there are concerns, they are
addressed . . . Grinnell may have
good standing, but its reputation will
not keep hard questions from being
asked."

Reaccreditation, which takes
place every ten years, is a laborious
but beneficial process for the cam—
pus. It begins at the prospective cam—
pus, where a committee is formed to
research and prepare a report on the
state of the school. The Second phase
begins when the campusisvisited by
a group of observers from peer insti-
tutions, called Consultant-Evaluators
by the NCA, to verify the finding of
the host committee's report. The
Consultant-Evaluators then write
their own account, and both are sub

mitted to the NCA, which votes on
whether or not to reaoeredit. The
process is time consuming and rig-
orous but it also gives schools an
opportunity to study areas that oth-
erwise would go unexamined,

“What the NCA Says is ‘don’t
treat it like a mandatory report’ ,” said
Lopatto, “they encourage schools to
do the selfstudy in a way that is ben-
eﬁcial to the college," The 1998 re
port focuses on items such as: recniite
ing Grinnell faculty, curricular diver-
sity, the quality of residence living
and social life, student learning as-
sessment programs and long range
planning. These and many other top-
ics are split up into seven categories
that will make up the body of the re
port. Research is far reaching and
began long ago: almostevery student
received a survey around Thanksgiv-
ing which not only entertained stu—
dents w1th questions about Mr. cool
and Ms. hard to get, but also gave
the committee valuable information
on student life,

“The evaluation is taking place at
a very significant time," said
Lopatto. “Since we started, Grinnell
began the process of looking for a
new president. The [new] informa»
tion in the self study report should
be very helpful for a new president."

So who evaluates the evaluators?

“There is political pressure, defi-
nitely," said Drake, who also sits on
the NCA‘s governing board. “The
executives in the organization com»
pare notes with executives from other
regions and often, members from
different regions participate on cam-
pus visits." The NCA, which is gov-
erned by its member institutions also
has three public, nonracademic
members on its Board.

The NCA is one of six national
accreditation groups throughout the
country and covers the most geo-
graphic area, from Ohio to Arizona.
The NCA itself was founded in 1895
and boasts over 975 institutions. in—
cluding high schools, colleges, uni-
versities and elementary programs.
The United States government deals
with the NCA as an intermediary be-
tween itself and colleges and univer-
sities‘ in deciding whether or not
schools will receive federal student
loans. Only schools accredited by
the NCA or other regional accredi-
tation associations can receive gov»
ernment funds, which gives the NCA
a tremendous amount of power.

 

that," Rost said.

“I feel like it's a partial victory,"
said the president of Student Organ
nizalion of Latino/as [SOL], Carlos
Maelas. “What actually convinced
them to give the go ahead for
multicultural space was partially that
multicultural students have been
clamoring for it for the last eight
years. But I think thatwhai has more
to do With this was the fact that all
the top ten schools in the nation have
multicultural centers."

Macias continued, “the trustees
are business people. What they can

react to best is business. If you talk
business with them, you get results.
We were trying to sell the idea of
multicultural space to them . . . What
finally brought them to our side was
the fact that with the large endow-
ment that we have, we now have the
ability to go into the top ten."

Despite his suspicions, however,
Macias is pleased with the progress
that has been made. “I really did not
believe that we were going to get
Space anytime soon, or get promised
space, I’m still really cautious about
this release," he said.

 

solicit some oftheir own funds. “The
budget wouldn‘t pay for everything;
we'd still have to come up with funds
from other sources to pay for trips,
This is right in line with the Student
Affairs desire to make funding more
accurate in terms ofrepresenting stun
dent interests,” Eilert commented.
Unfortunately, not every group
can look forward to expanding its
budget.“l think it would be great to
increase budgets but my concern is
that it needs to be done thoughtfully,"
said Crady. “There needs to be some
thoughtful spending; we don’t have
unlimited resources If we increase
the budget, we need to do it thought-
fully and notjust across the board,"
Students interested in bringing up
financial issues concerning student
spending are free to submit propos-
als to the Committee on Student Life.
which meets once every two weeks.
“What I would recommend to stu-
dents looking to change policy would
be that they notify me and go before
the committee and present propus»
als there," said Crady, Crady, who
has yet to meet with any student or
group concerning Student Affairs
spending this year, attributes the ab
scnce to a lack ofinforrnaiion. “Stu-
dents may just not know where to
go," he said.
MostofGrinnell’srevenue forlast
year’s budget was made up of en-

dowrnent spending, $22,700,000
and tuition & activity fees, which
accounted for $22,298,734.

Of endowment spending itself.
Treasurer David Clay said the
College’s current spending practices
are sensible. “The endowment,
through a carefully constructed
spending policy, provides a stream
of resources to Support current op
erations. Specifically, this policy
permits the of 4,5 percent of the
three-year moVing average market
value of our endowment funds.

This policy is designed to achieve
two objectives: 1) to provide a ﬂow
of resources to support current
spending which is stable and predict-
able and 2) to insure the long-temi
real purchasing power ofour endow-
ment funds Our policy accomplishes
both objectives and is respectful of
present and future Grinnellians."

Sources outside of the treasurer's
office-agree that 4.5 percent is typi~
cal ofinstitutlons of our size and re
sources. Irene Powell, Professor of
Economics and member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee which studies
Grinnell's relative position to other
schools agrees with Clay.

“It is fine to say ‘spending 4.5%
of a rolling average of the endow-
ment is very typical of similar insti~
iutlons‘" said Powell. “It's neither
unusually high nor Conservative,"
