Moffett and set designer Pip Gordon
worked together to come up with a cons
cept for the play’s Scenery. They re-
searched Spanish garden villa designs, as
well as Ottoman and Turkish inﬂuences
on Spanish architecture. When itcame to
actually making a blucpnni for ihc set.
however, ihc two wanted to create their
own world The result is a completely
original design which complrments the
mood or the play.

"Some people will wonder why the
Set and costumes are the wrong time and
place,” Moffelt said. "But Shakespeare
didn'tically write almutspmﬂ'ic historical
times and places There was no evrdcnce
thathc had overbccii to Athens orllaly, for
example. Mire/r Azlu About Not/mg is
written primarily about a beauui‘ul, ro-
mantic, fantastic place that we created
with a mixture of styles."

ior Eileen Oirlcy, built a half inch scale
model of the set, which will be on display
during the perfonnanoes. Work on the
actual set began six weeks ago The walls
of the set. which took five weeks to be
aSscmbled, are built like movie sets in that
theyaicsupponed by scaffolding, Embel-
lishments of the set were done with mate
rials like paper macho tor the texture, and
iron and dyed paper for trees.

Gordon estimates that at least 700
hours have been put into Scenery, lighting
and costumes for Much Ado. Theater

around 120 students have bocninvolvcdirl

cns productions always require more ex-
tensive Scenery," Gordon said, "but we
don't often build the set wall to wall. This

’ 0‘! THE CUT TNG EDGE

Sharp and Siqveland plan to try luck in music industry

By SARAH STAVETEIG
Arts & Entertainment Editor

0 years ago, when Senior
Dari Sharp played electric gui
tar for the loud campus band

Cordoumy , it was hardly imaginable
that he would ever turn toward the
acoustic vein. But that’s exactly what
happened. Sharp and his future must
cal partner, 1994 Grinnell graduate
Ioliii Siqveland, have both made the
transition from loud to quiet music.

“In a way we have been exploring
different things in a reaction to how
loud bands are. We just kind of
realized that it‘s easy to be loud its
harder to be quiet because it requires
more Subtlety.” said Sharp. “In a way
we're kind of antirhip and proud of
that. We're trying to ﬁnd our own
thing that has some kind of vulnerabilr
ity to it,"

Sharp was able to make the transr
tion from electn'e guitar to acoustic
because he originally took lessons in
both instruments. He has played in
bands since junior high and grown

stronger musically over time. ”I think
it does have to do with what you play
the music for and I’ve gotten better on
my instrument and i‘ve matured and
I've wanted to ﬁnd subtler ways to
express myself. Ibelieve that you get
numb to the dynamic peaks if you
don‘t have parts that are quieter too,"

His ability to play acoustic guitar,
electric guitar and bass gave Sharp the
opportunity to record a solo song {or
the Doze CD (to be released byHUM
Productions this May) Sharp over—
dubbed two guitar pans, bass and vo-
cals, to create his song. The song is
only 2| semester-long project, as Sharp
plans to move toMinncapolisand form
a band with Siqveiand.

“It'sfuniobesolo,"Sharpsaid. “I
hope that people don‘t see it as this

because I haven’t had people to play
with. Itsjustthatlohn Siqveland gradur

So far because Sharp wads to focus on
music,whsreasSiqveland conoenu-etts on
lyrics.

Sharp and Siqveland plan to won<
very seriously for at least two years on
music, and hope that their Minneapolis
conneCiions can help. ”We're both going
to ﬁrst work technically,” said Sharp.
"We have similar voioes as a part oi
learning to sing togehtcr. We have a fair
amount of connections Minneapolis. 1
have friends that I played with in Junior
High and Higi School bands with that are
doing really well and could possibly let us
play warmup. As a result. we have con-
necriorrs there so we’ll just build up sup
port and hope that this will go well.”

The new band that Siqveland and
Sharp hope to form in Minneapolis will
play, as Sharp describes, music that has
“folk music roots, but with more of an
edge. Wealsohzlveasidctousthatismore
interested in something slightly darker in
a Tom Waits kind of way."

Sharp acknowledges the risks in-
volved in trying to set up a band. “Its a
possibliry. Something that we're going
to try out and see if it works. We want to
have a full ban " he said, "The focus
will be pretty quiet The lyrics are going
to be pretty important and the harmo
rues. So distortion is going to be pretty
sparse. We’re going to take it seriously
but we realize that there are any number
of factors dial could change. We both
have a lot of possibiirries."

Sharp and Siqveland may return
next year for a campus performance, “II
we could get a gig here, that would be
great. I think that'd be a goal," he Said.
