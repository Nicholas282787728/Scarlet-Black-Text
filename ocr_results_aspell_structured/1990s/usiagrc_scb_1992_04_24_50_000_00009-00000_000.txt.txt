Student art exhibited in the Forum Gallery

. By Jennifer Vacchiano

‘ Elizabeth Banfield's exhibit,
“Faces in the Light," will be on dis
‘ play today until May 4 in the Forum
~ Terrace Gallery. The exhibit consists
of black and white photographs and
‘ charcoal drawings. It came out of an
- independent on portraiture which

“Faces of the Light“ came about
‘ becauseofBanficld sintercstinlight.
Throughout my years of studying
here atGrinnell, one of the most im
' portant elements has been light,’ ’she
, said. Black and white photographs
and drawings give her a medium to
' express interest in light, form and
, stmclurc.“Also,"sheexplaincd,“l’m
very interested in people." In both
‘ her drawings and photographs she
3 works at capturing faces.
Banﬁeld‘sphotographs aremostly
' of people she knows. “I wanted to
capturesomethingaboutthcmAwhat
made them unique,” she explained.

"Amy"

Her photos often capture happy ex~
pressions. ”Amy," for example, capA
tures the wonderful smile of a friend.
“Duchas” captures a thoughtful exA
prcssion on a neighbor's face. Also
on display will be a photograph,
untitled, which is presently on dis-
play in the Student Art Salon exhibit.

As Banﬁcld progressed in her por-
traiture project, she felt the project
“became less aboutportraits, and more
about pictures of people.”

“A friend asked me what the
difference was between portraits and
snapshots," Banﬁeld said and then
explained that she thought her pho-
tos walk the boundary between the
two because although portraits, they
have thespontaneous feelingofsnap-
shots. This can be seen especially in
her photograph “Kids" which cap-
tures {our laughing children.

Bunftcld explained thatshe is “in
teresled in composition and expres-
sion in the photographs, so that they
create something interesting visuV
ally butalso tcll something about the
character.” She has been inﬂuenced
in her photography by Anne Noggle,

a photographer who is also interested
in character.

Banfield’s drawings are mostly
self-portraits. In contrast to the pho»
tographswhichialthoughnotpoised
and often spontaneous; she der
scribes as “pure and clear," she de-
scribes her drawings as more “alive
and spontaneous."

Drawings are hard, she explains,
because “everyone can tell when a
face is off—we look at them all day.
Gesture has to be done just right."
Banfield is experimenting with light
and dark contrasts in her drawings
She has been inﬂuenced by John
Singer Sargentﬁlum-of—Lherccntury
American artist who did many char-
coal portraits.

A senior art major with a concen-
tration in art history, Banftcld hopes
tocontinuc with herartaftcrgraduatr
ing. She would like to enter a creative
field such as advertising, which ap-
peals to her because “there is a con
stant creative energy necessary.”

There will be an opening recepr
tion for Banfield’s exhibit tomorrow
from 7:00 pm. to 8:00 pm.
