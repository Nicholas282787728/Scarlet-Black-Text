It’s finally here. Thar rime ofyear when the Films Commirree decides to
rhrow us a changeeup. Yes, no more rrivial films iusr ro pass rhe time before
mass consumprion of inroricaring fluids. Every Harris arrcndee will now be
shown awe-inspiring ﬁlms, which force rhe viewer to experience rhe palate of
emorion. The Oscar nominees are here. Our lives are complcrc. However, we
srill suggesr nor gerring all fired up. More rhan likely rhe projectorwill ear rhc
ﬁlm, or rhe sound will suck, or it will be upside down.

As movie reviewers, we would like ro rake a srcp back and ralk abourTirular

Head. Firsr off, we would like ro say rhar ir is a personal insulr to us rhar we _

were nor asked ro be on rhe panel ofiudges. lr was also a lircle annoying ro have
all die yelling going on rhrough rhemovies (is “(his movie sucks" rhe only
phrase you know?). We would like so give out our own Tirular Head awards.
ryou won‘r go: a prize, bur maybe if you see us, and you're real nice, we’ll buy
you a Coke. ,

Playing Friday nighr ar Harris at 7:30.

This movie was wrirrcn by, direcred by, produced by, and srars Warren Fearry.
I guess hes a politician who, according ro Aaron, “goes crazy and srarrs saying
whar's on his mind”. lfyou wanr ro see 60-something year old Beatty hook up
wirh Halle Berry, rhen we recommend rhis movie. Best rhing to come our of
rhis movie, aocording ro Aaron, is “Gherco Supasrar". Personally, I prefer rhe
Kenny Rogers/Dolly Parron version berrer.

Saving Private Ryan
Plays Saturday ar 7:30.

SrarsTum Hanks, Marr Damon, Ted Danson. Direcred by Sreven Spielberg:

C: I really liked rhis movie.

A: You’ve all heard abour rhe opening barrle sequence, which is quite re.
mazkablc. The aspecr do: really gor me was rhe sers and einemarogmphy. The

colors, really set rhe rone.

c: AIrer all rhe hype about rhe opening sequence, 1 was nor as afreered by
rhe blood and gurs as l was supposed to be. How’s rha: for desensitization?

Please be aware rhar Matt Damon is only on screen for abour 27 minures.
Unforrunarely, a very old Ted Danson shares some of rhar screen rime. 1 also
enjoyed die cinemarography and l ehoughr rhar rhe group ofacrors worked
very well rogerher. Too bad ihe hor sniper guy had ro die.

A: Hanks deserved his Oscar nominarion, but I'm glad he didn’t win. I feel
I've seen chis role beIore in war films, such as Phnwn. The plor wasn’t all rhar
original, bur Spielberg made up for rhar. The man can flar—our direcr. And
Hanks can flar-our acr. Th5: rwo really made rhe film fly. And Courrney's
just upser rhar Damon didn't rake offany clorhes.

C: Funny. lwould suggest char you check rhis movie our even rhough ir
won’r end unril 10:30 and you may have re wait for she second keg ro arrive.
Ir’s worrh seeing ar leasr once, ifyou've never seen it before. And ifyou have

A: It’s a good mix ofacrion and hearr, which she Academy usually ears up:
bur nor rhis year. At leasr Spielberg gor his second Ecsr Direcr‘or srarue.

Saving Private Ryan

Welcome to War
Zorka Milin

In case you forgo: (or if you missed rhe poinr of Srhiniilzr’s 2m), Sreven.
Spielberg would like ro remind you rhar war is a very bad rhing. I say rhere
should be a law againsr Spielberg making movies abour subjects ofsuch weighte;
Plagued wish weak plor premise and heavy reliance on formulas, Saving Prime:
Ryrm is a mediocre mm which merely nods in rhc dlrccrion ofrealism before.
descending lnro an abyss ofcliehes.

A: rhe cenrer of rho srory are eighr soldiers led by capraln Miller (Tom
Hanks). Somehow, just afrer DDay, rhey have been assigned a mission to'
rescue ayoung privare (whose rhree orher brorhers were his: killed in ﬁghringL
from behind enemy lines. The search for Ryan rakes rhe soldiers across rhe-
hellish rcrrain oIWorld War ll France. ofcourse, someone made a mosr unsr
forrunare Casting decision ro have rhar prerry boy Mar: Damon (fresh our of.
60011 \WI Hunting) play privare Ryan. I don't know abour you, bur for me,
rhis seriously weakened rhe whole rhing.

My orher major complain: is char rhe film does injustice ro hisrory. Those
of us who are nor American may wonder why Hollywood makes ir seem rhar_
rhe Yanks “liberated” Europe on rheir own. Well, here's a hisrorical rrivia bi:
for you: rhe Unired Srares didn’t enrer rhe war in Europe unril ir was rhree
quarrers over. By June 1944, rhc fare ointler had already been sealed, largely
by German defeat ar rhe hands of rhe Red Army in rhc Battle ofSralingrad
(January 1943).

Whar parricularly borhers me abour hang I’m/Rt: Ryan is irs self-impor-I
rance and prerense ro rhe rirle of rhe grearesr war movie ever made”. The
movie has roo many Spielbergisms and cliches and plor disrracrions ro merir,
rhar honor Difficulr as lr is to place superlarives, ld say that rhe bcsr war film
I have ever seen would have to be one of rhe following: Renoirs Le Grand!
Juror-or (cultural ﬁlm coming ro Grinnell in a few weeks), Apocalypse Now:
Cochoming Vumam or Prmy Village Preny Pierre (relarively recenr Serbian
ﬁlm available in Hurling Lisrening Room) ,

Finally, I managed ro think of one reason ro recommend skiing Privaté
Ryan. die amazing you re righr. rhere realism ofbarrle sequences, wirh an un.‘
ginehing eye, horrors o don rhe screen. The opening sequence is,
£11k: possibly rhe' clo‘s'esr anyon has come ro a‘cru'a’ll‘y ‘capruring :he savage:

rensiry ofinranrry warfare However, rarhcr ‘rhan‘ saying SnvingI’rii/atzkymi'
is realisric, I would describe rr as having some realisric momenrs But perhaps
even rhar is a grear cinemaric achievemenr for a counrry rhar has die privilege‘
ofeasily forgetting whar war is like.

Felicia probably forms rhe closest relationship ro Priscilla. Normally rough
and cruel beyond belief, hardened ro rheworld, he is rhe one who helps Priscilla
become rhe queen char she is roday. Perhaps ir is because he has experienced so
much of rhe same harred and rejection in life rho: Priscilla has encounrcred
rhar makes him able to undersrand her and know whar ro give her in rhe rela-
rionship. This relarionship is really one of rho few redeeming aspecrs of rhis
characrerrhar I found rhis render side that Priscillais able ro bring our ofh .

I find myself searching for some srrand ofa rolarionship becween Priscilla
and Teke, but I have re say I rhink Teke :s ius: using Priscilla. Firs: off, all he
seems ro be concerned abour is gcrcing to rhc middle oirheAusrralian deserr r'q
see rhar wife and son of his drar he abandoned. Maybe ifhe did show any
inceresr in Priscilla, he would probably just abandon her roo, when he didnk
need her anymore. Secondly, rhere aren’t really any shared meaningful me;
menrs berween Priscilla and Teke. Admirredly, he is a lirrle shaken and sympa;
rhericwhen somebody deﬁles her body and wrires nasry rhings on her, bur rhis
is probably more because rhe words wrirren on her were direcred towards him-
and his friends. dfcoursc larcr when Felicia is giving Priscilla rhose luscious

Eernaderrc however, now her relarionship wirh Priscilla is a liulc more cornl
plex. bernaderre is a real lady, mannered, and post-op. lrhink a grea: amounr
orrhe rension berween Priscilla and Ecrnaderre comes nor from any one par—
ricular cvenr, bur an ongoing sorr of feminine comperirion. If you notice,
when one ofrhem has a problem, rhc ocher one has ro chime in rhere and be a
little more dramacic abour her problem. I’m kind ofsurprised we didn't have
any link ‘car—fighrs' break out bcrween rhe two of rhem on rhe whole :rip,

has Bernaderresray behind for rhesc-cond parr ofrhe nip, and why many ofrhe‘
shors concaining Bernadcrrc and her issues rake place somewhere away from
Priscilla, like inside a horel or somerhing.
