SCRATCHINGS OF A MAD MAN
Student facilities mismanaged

Grinnell’s an odd place. It can
claim to be unique in all manner of
respects, ranging from its strange
mutation ofpolitically correct “liberr
alism" to its popular but imperfect
self-goveming residence hall system.
In an age of relative conformity, con-
trol and conservatism, it still seems to
value diversity, independenceand ex—
perimentation. But amongst this are
some rather curious anomalies. We,
the students of Grinnell College, are
babied along from the day we apply
for admission till the day we gradur
ate, by overzealous administrators.
professors who spoon-feed studens
with information rather than putting
sufﬁcient faith in their ability to con—
duct their own research, and supervia
sion intended to be benevolent but
more often intrusive.

There are few places where this is
more apparent than in the manage
ment of student facilities. For here
must be one of the few campuses in
the western world where the student
union buildings, namely the Harris
Center and the Forum, are not run by
the student government. Instead they
tire managedbytheOfficeofStudent
Affairs, which assumes full control
over their regulation.

committee. Ever thought of catering
your own event in South Lounge?
Probably not, for Food Service has a
monopoly over sewing in a place
whose use is generally restricted to
symposia and musical events. You
might also try scheduling daytime
eventsat the Harris Center. but you
will be informed that it does not open
before 5 pin on any day of the week.
These regulations are an interesting
parallel to the ridiculous requirement
that student groups register with the
Office of Student Activities rather
than with SGA itsclf.

These regulations have unfortu-
nate consequences. Student facilities
are grossly tinder-used. Indeed in re
cent years, the Forum‘s north and
south lounges, once hives ofactivity,
have become little more than venues
for guest speakers and the occasional
movie. On a typical evening the vast
open space of South Lounge is seatv

dents studying. Sometimes there is
no one but a Copulating couple on the
couch. or even no one at all. The
Harris Center is likewise normally
deserted for want of events, but cur-
rent regulations hurt the likelihood of
it being used creatively on a frequent
basis.

Administmtive intrusiveness also
severely dents the spirit of selngovv
emance that the Ofﬁce of Student
Affairs has tried to foster in its resi-
dence hall system. While students
enjoy almosttotal freedom with what
they do wherethey live, the excessive
control on the public areas of campus,
while hurting Grinnell’s social life.
also undermines both the effective-
ness of student government and even
the students' sense of initiative.

Now, however, there is a sign of
positive change. SGA has been in

EYES WIDE OPEN

Long road for human rights

It was a long and trying break for
me this last time around. I thought
that I should take advantage of the
free time and die holiday spirits and
visit my family. When I am newly
employed this time next year I prob
ably won‘t get four weeks vacation.

I went back to ole Oklahoma, got
a new hat for the occasion (~ la the
nativeOklahomai'iGarlhBrooks),and
donned a discreet Okic twang. There
1 was, saddled up with my political
fervor in one holster and my
strcnthening Dykedom in the other.
Could I hold out? ‘Course not.

Forgive me, Mother God, for l
have sinned. I let slide more racist
comments thanleancount.lrecyeled
nothing.lflushedcverysingletime—
itwasn’tmyhome,lwasjusttryingto
be polite. l avoided talking with my
father about the L word. I never said
it in frontof him. I said nothing when
my most open minded relatives were
most critical about feminist separat-
ism.

However, I did more this break
than last. I defended my right to call
myself a Dyke, despite protests that
“at least ‘Lcsbiaiis’ don’t hate men.”
I put Louie’s name and mine on our
presents to my relatives. Ispoke often
of “my partner.“ I taught my eighta
yearroldhalfbrotherlhatslappinghis

was rude and insensitive, and that
“Gay" is not an insult. He proceeded
to lecture our nine-year-ol'd cousin a

few daysiater. Ialso tried toeonvince
him that people who didn’t speak
English weren’twcird. I offered my»
self up for example and spatouta few
syllablesochmianihe wasn’t very
impressed. Even my Dyke-aunt from
Dallas failed me when she laughed at
the sexistJoke I meant to present for
criticism. I turned red and dropped
the subject.

I realize, of course, that the real
world will not be rctidy for my vision
ofjustiee for a long while. The real
world would get ‘ti lot of help front a
few years at Grinnell. The tedious,
basic lessons of human rights seems
to pass by most people. And while I
can breathe easier here, the Grinnell
community needs some shaping up
too—more refined tuning, more exr
plieit education. I'm rollin’ up my
sleeves, sisters and brothers, we have
a long road to pave before the restcan

FRIENDLY FIRE
Sip 'n Rinse...

There are three words which can
be uttered on the Grinnell College
campus that provoke either complete
nausea or instant laughter, depending
on the disposition of the speaker or
the listener. Sip ‘n Rinse. For thoseof
you not familiar with this medical
wonder, Sip ‘n Rinse is a gargle/
mouthwash provid ed by the Health
Center to ailing students with sore
throau. Whatever its medical ben-
efits may be, (and some people will
swwby it) the public image of Sip ‘n
Rinse has in the past been somewhat
equivalent to that of a flatulent war-
thog. One student I spoke to claimed
to have had a “near death experience”
with Sip 'n Rinse.

All that is changing now. Not un-
like Michael Iaekson, Joan Rivers
and Cher, Sip ‘nRinsehas been given
a face lift. In place of the old label.
which was as bland as the gargle was
pungent, stands a poprartish Roy
Lichtensteinresque picture of a
woman’s lipvsticked, pearly-toothed
mouth anxiously awaiting a packetof
Sip ‘n Rinse instantmouthwash. The
professionals of the Health Center
report that they have not observed
any significant increase in the use of
Sip ‘n Rinse.

I spoke with Robin (she requested
that her last name be withheld) of
Highland Packaging Labs in
Somervillc,NewJersey which manu-
factures Sip ‘n Rinse and asked her
about the change. She explained that
the new packaging was an attemptto
make Sip ‘ri Rinse more salable on
the open market. According to her,
the new label has only been placed on
the mint-ﬂavored packets. Highland
Labs also produces a mild citrus ﬂa-
vor (minus the new label) which the
Health Center no longer orders be-
cause students don’t like its taste;
however, Robin (a regular Sip ‘n
Rinser) confessed that she prefers the
mild citrus much more than the mint
ﬂavor, even with the new hip label.
My own quasirscicntific test has re-
vealed that the iaste Sip ‘n Rinse
leaves in your mount has not been
much affected by the up-scaled label.

Not unlike Sip ‘n Rinse, Presi-
dent Bush recently made an official
trip of-state to New Hampshire to try
and rework his image there from ajet-
setting, globe-ironing, intemational-
ist to that of a kinder, gentler, more
concerned about the domestic
economyand the little folk. President
of the United States. He went to a
Head Start daycare center, where he
looked aboutas comfortable as David
DukeataBarMitzvah.andaririeunced
iliathe would increase funding for the
program by $600 million, funding
which hepromisedin1988 andwhich
others claim is still $400 million to
little. He talked about jobs, jobs, jobs
and assailed protectionism. He talked
about level playing ﬁelds and free-
falling economies. He talked like a
man of the people. Unfortunately for
Mr. Bush, his down-scaled. “I can

Josh Ford

sympathize with your plight," ap-
proach left many New Hampshire
residents with a similarly unpleasant
Sip ‘n Rinse—ish (mint flavor) taste in
their mouths.

The reason why we are perpetu-
ally let down by the performance of
these newly re-designed products is
simple. The manufacturers- Highland
Labs, Mossbacher. et al. forgot to
change the content of their goods. I
don’t care if Sip ‘n Rinse gets Andy
Warhol to return from the dead and
custom design the package, no one
who thought Sip ‘n Rinse was vile
before the re-design is going to ﬁnd it
any more palatable, simply because
its the same old ingredients. Good
tastejust ain’t in there!

Similarly, George Bush telling
the people of New Hampshire that he
can sympathize with iheirplight sim~
ply isn’t true despite whatever he
doesoutwardly toconvince diein oth—
erwise. At heart George Bush has
always been a Yale man, born to a
rich family who to this day is more in
