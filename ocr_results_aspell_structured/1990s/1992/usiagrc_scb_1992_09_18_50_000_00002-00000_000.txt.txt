Gardner lives again!!!

by Alexander Kambouroglou

“There's going to be a Gardner
Party on Friday!" To most upper-
classmen itsounded like ajoke,since
a Gardner Party is something that
belongs to the past. It‘s not long ago
that the mall—like Harris Center ap-
peared on this campus, and already
its presence seems to have overshad-
owed the memories of the Gardner
days. And everyone learned to love
Harris with its spacious ceilings, the
special dance floor, its non-smokin g
policy, and that cold atmosphere——
Not. For a large number of Grinnell
College‘s students, Harris is a place
somewhere on Nonh Campus, the
place which caused Gardner’s de-
mise. The weekend before lasthow
ever. Gardner came back to life.

And what a come back it was—
like in the old days, only better, since
not too many people smoked. The
music wasn‘t very loud, yet everye

The "Bates" sign
from our front
door is missing.
We Wish that
whoever
"borrowed" it
would return it.

one danced ecstatically. The crowd
was large and came mostly from
Bob’s Underground, where students
who didn’t want to attend othercamr
pus events went to drown their bore-
dom in caffeine, onlyto discover that
Gardner was hack to life. The scene
wasn’tquitelhe same thispastweekr
end, when an open mike Blues night
was organized. A lot of people
stopped by, only a few could handle
the improvisations taking place. The
ones who rcmaincdia small crowd
of juniors and seniorsihad a good
time,

Nonetheless, for two weekends
in a row, returning students had a
chance to remember the old Gardner
days, and entering students had the
chance to experience it for the first
time. For the objective observer,
botll parties were a great time Maybe
it's the low ceiling, maybe it‘s the
smoke, maybe its the sweaty bodies Ann Lane will be Speaking this
grooving, touching each other, or Thursday the 24th of September at
perhaps the simple fact that it‘s not Convocationasihe fustofmanyNoun

 

Ham's. Either way, Gardner has
something special about it and it’s a
fact that a lot of us would like it to be
back for good. Let us hope so.

Lane examines the case brought
against Sears, Roebuck and Com-
pany iorsexual discriminationin their
hiring and promotion practices for
high paying jobs. The case was de
cided in 1986. The speciﬁc charge
was, “rlfailing to hire female applir
cams for commission seeling on the
same basis as male applicants and
failing to promote female
uoncommission salespersons into
commission sales." (Lane 3). Ms.

sis of an examination of the some
20,000 pages of court room tranr
scriptl She uses the courtroom
dialouge to examine the complex is-
sues of the interplay of academic,
legal, and corporate discourses. In
her discussion of “competeing dis-
courses” she elaborates on the de-
mand of“equal interest" and the com—
plex courtroom dynamics. Another
important impact of the case is the
complexities within the women’s
movement which it displays.
