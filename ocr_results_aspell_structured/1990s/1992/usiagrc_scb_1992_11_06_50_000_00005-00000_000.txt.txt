Ibsen colloquium Sunday evening

The Either/Orchestra, a group from the Boston area, will give a concert this Thursday.

Innovative group returns to Grinnell

Under sponsorship of the Pet»
forming Arts Program, the Either/
Orchestra of Cambridge and Boston
returns to South Lounge Thursday
evening. Nov. 12 at 8:00 PM. The
band needs no introduction to those
who have heard them, For those who
have not, E/O has been described as
one of the more audacious and daring

groupson the jazz scene,bridging the
gap between pop, funk, free-fonn,
blues and jazz.

The goup's instrumentation con-
sists of two trumpets, two trombones,
three saxes, bass, keyboard, guitar
and percussion Drawing from the
members’ roots in electronic jazz,
funk,mariacht,HaiLian,salsaandEu-

ropean classical idioms. the ensemble
combines a big-band sound with the
freedom of a small combo. Most of
the material is original. strongly in-
ﬂuenced by Charles Mingus.
Ellington,Monk,SunRaandColtt-ane.
However it is the group‘s spontaneity
and“fun" format thatwins the hearts of
audiences. “A very hip group.”

Influential Italian film in Cultural Series

Written and directed by Paolo
and Vittorio Taviani , Padre . Pudmnc
isamodem masterpiece,visuallystark
and lyrical and strikingly innovative
in its use of sound. It is notable for its
stylistically adventurous renewal of
neorealism. The ﬁlm shows its direc-
tors’ sense of Marxist utopianism.
which is exemplified by the film’s
rich artistic detachment, Itdoes, how7
ever. transcend theconventional idea
ofthe“politicalﬁlm,”inuiatitretztins
an ideological objectivity. It can be
said that Padre. Padrone helped to
transform Italian cinema.

The film is based on a true story
ofashepherd who had lived in almost
total isolation in the remote hills of
Sardinia until he turned twenty, when
a stint in the army opened up new
worlds; continuing his education,
Gavino Ledda went on to become a
professor of linguistics and returned
home to affect change in the environ-
ment from which he emerged. The
final scenes show the transformative
powers of education in redeeming the
boy‘s early experiences of brutal pov-
erty, graphically depicted in scenes
of peasant farm life.

Many of the Tavianis’ films de-
pict such stories; those of an impov-
erished protagonist who leaves an

isolated and misery-ridden back-
ground to seek a betterlifc in the city.
When the advantages of urban ‘civi-
lization’provetobeasham.theseeker
(in thiscaseGavinoLedda) mustcon-
front his past and come to terms with
his roots.

As thedirectorsoftheﬁlm delved
deeper into Gavino's autobiography,
they came to realize that the
shepherd‘s character was not formed
simply by his monumental loneliness
andestran gement, but by a far greater
impediment—wills terrifying and ty-
rannical father.

Sound is used in this film to
embellish and even affect the visual
reality represented on screen. For
example. when in the opening scene
Gavino’s father threatens him.
Gavino‘s ten-ified thoughts can be
heard on the soundtrack. This effect
is even more noticeable in a follow-
ing scene, where Gavino is attempt
ing to milk a goat and becomes angry
when the goat defecates in the pail of
milk. On the soundtrack both
Gavino‘s and the goat’s angry
droughts can be heard. Gavino soon
becomessexuallyarousedandbegins
to have sexwith the goat: Inter,Gavino
joins his friends, who are having sex
with a flock of chickens. The father

observes the boys, becomes aroused
himselfand makesanoontime visit to
his wife. Soon the heavy breathing of
both the boys and Gavino‘s parents
can be heard echoing each other A
panoramic shot of the village fol-
lows, as the heavy breathing sounds
leap from house to house—as though
every person in the town were taking
part in an orgy,

Padre, Padrone won the Cannes
Golden Palm Award for Best Film
and the International Critics' Award
in 1977. It is 114 minutes long, in
Italian with English subtitles.
Showtimes are Friday and Saturday,
Nov 6 and 7 at 8:00 PM and Sunday,
Nov. 8 at 2:00 PM.
