SEA bake sale today

— proceeds to assist drought relief

by Riva Sharples

Students toEnd Apartheid hopes
to raise over $100 this week from
Grinnell College students and faculty
in order to assist in drought relief
efforts in Africa. according to orgae
nizer Rachel Eldridge. The money,
which will be collected through a
bake sale this morning in the Post
Office and duough additional dona-
tions, will be used by CARE and
otlter international famine-relief or
ganizations, Eldridge said.

“When studenm and faculty do-
nate money or buy something at the
bake sale, they can designate a spe,
cific country for their money to go
toward,” she said.

The four African countries being
targeted in the famine-relief project
are Somalia. Ethiopia, South Africa.
and Rwanda.

Somalia, with a population of 7
and a half million (1991 estimate),
has been ﬁghting a civil war since
January of 1991. More than 300,000
Somalis have died thus far to famine-
relatedillnessessincethestanoffight-

ing. according to theUnited Nations.
Currently. an estimated 1.5 million
additional Somalis are in danger of
starvation if relief does not arrive
soon.

Although a push by the media
and the UN has triggered world-wide
assistance to Somalia. not all food
being donated to the effort is getting
through borders and road blocks and
many people are still starving. Prob-
lems with transponation of food and
aid include interception of aid packr
ages by rebel forces and mandatory
airplanelandingfeesofbetweenSZOO
and $1,000 on all aircraft.

In an effort to alleviate the crisis
in Somalia, the UN is holding a con-
ference this week in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. The organization hopes to
implement a pledge made in Geneva
in October to give up to 88 million
dollars in food and aid to the country.
The United States is also considering
sending armed troops to Somalia in
an attempt to assure that the food
reaches those in need.

Ethiopia, which suffered a se-
vere famine in 1984, is again plagued

by drought, disease. and starvation.
In Ethiopia’s eastern Ogaden region,
where more than a million refugees
have gathered, a malaria epidemic is
killing more titan 14 people a day,
according to a November report by
the Ethiopian News Agency. Treatr
merit of the disease is hindered by a
shortage of medicine, poor sanitary
conditions, and unreliable transpor-
tation of food and aid.

Another little-known country
suffering from famine is Rwanda.
The small republic, located between
Tanzania; the Congo, and Burundi,
has received little media coverage or
world aid in the past few months.
With a population of roughly 7 mile

as well as other diseases.

by Riva Sharples

The Grinnell College Theater
Department hopes to expand its face
ulty next year and offer a permanent
position to Professor Pip Gordon.
Currently working under a terminal
two-yearcontraet, Gordon will finish
her two years of teaching at Grinnell
College next semester. Concerned
students and facuty who do not want
to see Gordon leave have been writ-
ing letters to Theater Department
Chairman Sandy Moffett and have
been holding informal discussions
about the situation.

For the past year and a half, Gor-
don has filled the shoes of professor

“In the department, professors
take turns filling the position of As-
sistant Dean," said Moffett. “The
first three years Czechowski was
Assistant Dean, Jim Taylor filled his
position. Then Jim gotanother posi-
tion and Pip was hired.“

Czechowski will return to his
teaching position next year, but
Moffett hopes that Gordon will not
have to go. ltis time to strengthen the
Theater Department, he said.

“I feel as almost everyone here
feels," he said. “She is really quite a
good teacher and a wonderful de-
signer. " [The Theater Department

feels] that there are two areas that
need additional strengthening: per-
fonrianceand design. Everyone wants
Pip to stick around.”

Moffett is currently polishing his
request for additional faculty mem-
bers and Will submit it to the Dean.
Moffett hopes that the requestwill be
granted.

”For all intentions and purposes,
we have four full-time faculty mem-
bers,"he said. “We haven’thad addiv
tional members for a very long time.
Pip is a great teacher. It’s now a
matter of negotiating and trying to
increase the size of the faculty and
then asking Pip if she will stay on
with us.”

In the Venda territory of South
Africa, a severelackofrain iscausrng

adequate water supply, much of the
