Obituary for Menachem Begin

Menachem Begin was Israel’s
most inﬂexible and combative prime
minister. Believing that the conflict
between Israel and its Arab enemies
could only be ended through vio
lence, he ordered a number of mili-
tary strikes against the Arabs. Ac-
cordingly he is remembered as a Zi-
onist warrior: but his other identities
are sadly overlooked. Begin’s life
saw a weird conﬂuence of political
forces—he was a survivor of
Stalinism, a warrior against British
colonialism, and a cunning opposi-
tion politician.

Born in Lithuania in 1913, Begin
immigrated at an early age to Poland,
wherehejoinedaZiontstoutIiicalleit
Betar. After the Nazis invaded Po-
land in September 1939 he, along

’ with many other Jews, fled to
Lithuania, which by then had been
annexed by the Soviet Union under
the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, Begin
couldhavefledtoPalestine,whsrehe
would have had many friends, but he
believed his duties to Betar required
him to stay in Europe.

Begin’s choice ofa refuge proved
anunhappy onewhen theSovietthugs
occupying Lithuania arrested him as
a “hooligan" (the Soviets’ colorful
term). “For me and my family,“ Be»

Mike Washburn

gin later lamented (see S. Stoffer’s
book Begin, 1988), “the whole world
was plunged into darkness." But
Begin's will was like an adamantine
rock, When his captors demanded
that he sign a statement impugning
his activities in Betar, he refused,
prompting the Sovteis to resort to
lorturc,which proved useless.Acutely
frustrated,they madehim sitforsixty
hours in a chair facing a wall.

They released him underan agrcer
mentsigncd by Stalin and the ousted
Polish leaders. By 1944 he was in
Palestine leading Irgiin, one of sevr
eral Jewish outfits opposing British
domination. Some of Irgun’s deeds
were repellent, like the bombing of
the King David Hotel, which housed
not only British officials but Arabs
and Jews as well. But largely as a
resultofsuch terrorism,theBritish in
1948 ﬁnally gave the Jews their own
state (an act Jewish leaders had been
calling for ever since an 1897 con-
vention in Switzerland).

For many years after the British
concession ,Begin lurked in theshad-
ows of Israeli politics, unable tomake

his wild pugnacny attractive to his
countrymen. Then in 1977, after Is-
raelhadsurvivcd fourattemptsbythe
Arabs to destroy it, Israeli voters elr
evated him to the leadership of their
state. They wantedaleaderwho would
fightbackaandtheyelectiedtheright
man.

In 1981 Begins regime carried
out a brilliant aerial strike against
Saddam Hussein‘s nuclear plant at
Osirak. Amid the shrill condemna-
tions of the |eft»wing U.S. media,
there wastittlerccognition of the merit
of the strike, which prevented Iraq
from acquiring a nuclear bomb. If
Iraq hadbeenanuclearpowerwhcnit
invaded Kuwait in 1990, the Persian
Gulf War might have taken a very
differentcoursc.

The next year, in response to an
escalated assaulton Israeland its citi-
zens by the Palestine Liberation Or-
ganization, Begin ordered Israeli
forces to enter Lebanon and destroy
the terrorist bases there. This cam-
paign (villified even more shrilly by
the left) was notas decisive asuccess,
for it dragged on until 1983 without
eliminating all of the terrorist bases.
But it did get some of them. thus

Why do we need Pride Week?

Pride Week is finally here. I’m
proud to say I had a lot to do with it,
and I hope the week has been an eye
opener for many people.

Thegay,lesbianandbisexualcom-
munity has atwayshad lotsof support
on Grinnell's campus. And we do
appreciate it. But many people still
ask why we have Pride Week. They
may do it tactfully, but they essen-
tiallyask us,whydoyouliavetobeso
blatant, so in»my»face? We accept
you here. What do you want? When
will you be satisfied?

When will Ibe satisfied?

When I can hold hands with my
girlfriend in the movie theater in my
town.

thn i can take her out for a
‘iDmanLiC dinner, and be acknowl-
edged as a couple, and get the same
knowing smile from the waitress and
otherdinersthatheterosexualcouples
get.

When I can tell everyone in my
family, including my grandmothers,
about my relationshipsand they will
gladly listen.

When I can walk down the street
and not fear the hostilities of young
people who have had few positive
role models.

When I can count on getting and
keepinganyjob forwhichlamquali-
fied, regardless of my sexual orienta-
tion.

Whenlcan haveawedding in any
church,andenjoydomeslicpartership
rights such as joint taxes and insur-

ance benefits, and adopt and raise a
child with the woman I love.

When 1 can teach in any school
and tell my students about my private
life if they are interested.

When teenagers can beopenabout
their sexuality with all their class-
mates and teachers, and go to dances
with whomever they want, and electa
homecoming queen and queen if they
so desire.

When we can tnarch in other
people's parades, succeed in Holly-
wood, be elected to leadership posts.

When all of my lesbian, gay and
bisexual brothers and sisters all over
the world can enjoy these basic hue
man rights as well,

Whenwecancomcout,andpcople
will say so what.

When we can be proud of our
selves all the time, without reservaA
tion.

When we don't have to have 21
Pride Week.

FRIENDLY EIRE

Now that it has snowed in April
you can honestly say that your fiist
spring in Grinnell has begun. I hope
you’re getting used to the quirkiness
of the weather, its not Miami Beach,
butthenagainwedon’thavetoworry
about hurricanes. Enough small talk.

You've been part of the Grinnell
community for almostayear now,so
its time toaskand answersomequesr
tions. The first question being, do we
know you yet? The answer unfortu-
nately is no, And that‘s not necessar-
ily a bad thing. What it means to me
is that those people who are quick to
condemn you as a token woman, a
cold fish, an aloof administrator, a
PcnlvianCommunistorElvis'cousin
really have no baSis for their Judg-
ment.Ltkewisethosewhodefendyou
as having a clear and rational
multicultural agenda, being an able
adminisu-ator, having a likable per-
sonality have no basis for dicirjudg-
ment because, again, we just don’t
know you yet.

I know it probably takes a year or
two to settle into yourjob and really
get to “know" the campus and its
inhabitantsButweasstudents havea
hard time relating to that because
after acoupleof weeks here, we know
everybody, Once you get past fall
break in October it is a rare occur-
rence to see a face you don't recog-
nize. By spring break, there’s a large
portion of the campus who you‘re
sick of seeing. For us, Grinnell CoIA

lege is a pretty easy place to get accli-
mated [0111 a number OI WMKS, W8

don't think in terms of years. Once
we're here two years we're halfway
out the door: spending a semester
abroad, we feel like We’ve been here
forever.

Now the George Drake thing. No
one expects you to be George Drake.
For one thing you're rttuch taller than
he was and he didn’t wear high heels
as often. We don’t expect you to sit
around and talk aboutthe“old Limes"
tatGrinnell. We don'tneed to see you
Jogging on the golf course. We just
need to see you.

A couple of weeks ago I saw you

 

Can we call you Pam?

at the Forum Grill getting a cup of
coffee before a speaker. You were
surprised to see that the permanent
mugs and glasses had been replaced
byStyrofoamcups.Out-of-touch mo-
ment number 357. Anyone who has
been to the Grill over the past semes-
ter and a half has seen the number of
mugs and glasses dwindle. You are
theonlypersonI’veencountered who

Josh Ford

has seemed surprised by the reap-
pearance of the ozone-eating
Styrofoam cups.

The point is not that you need to
pay closer attention to silverware on
campus, but closer attention to the
way students are living day-today.
We need to see you involved every
now and then. Come down during the
day and have a bagel at the Grill.
Have you been to Bob’s Underground
yet? Take your time getting there but,
when you do, kick back, have a
cappucino and listen to whatstudents
are saying. Its great that you were at
the Open Forum on harassment last
week. It would have been even better
if we had some clue about what your
impressions were. Were you heating
these things for the first time? As
President what could you have told us
about the “Presidential Hearing
Board?" What do you consider when
you receive a case on appeal?

Whatconcems me is not that you 're
not going to get to icnow onnneii. but

that we have no idea what pans of
Grinnell you feel likeyou doordon’t
know.

Thecnticismisn’tbecausewewant
George Drake back, but because we
want Pam Ferguson here. I had no
doubt last year after your open forum
that you were the best candidate for
Grinnell. I liked how you stood next
to instead of behind the podium, and
it feels like since you’ve been here
you’veretreated.lfyou wanttobethe
President of this college and not is
administrative overseer, then its time
to drop the podium.
