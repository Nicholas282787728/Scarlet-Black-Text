DINOSAUR DAYS
Celebrate women in our midst

MarchisWomen'sHistory Month.
We are celebrating the lost voices of
women in ourpast, but] think that we
might take this opportunity to also
celebrate strong women who are liv—
ing in our midst. Beverly Anderson
and Sally Vitera are two such women
living and working right in down
town Grinnell.

BeverlyandSallyopenedNature's
Garden at the end oflanuary. Even if
youthinkthattheideaofahealthfood
store in a college town is less than
extraordinary,thesewolnenand what
they have accomplished certainly are.
Last year, they attended a 16 week
business course offered through the
Institute for Social and Economic
Development (ISED) based in Iowa
City. For eight hours every Tuesday,
Beverly and Sally drove to
Marshalltown to attend the first class
whiclt would graduate from the pro-
gram. Beverly and Sally, friends be-
fore they opened the store, learned
about the course through the Mid-
Iowa Community Action office in
town,

Sally is a single mother, raising

Ann Treistman

her six year old daughter while work-
ing as a nurses’ aide at the Grinnell
Hospital. She was first interested in
running a food store for diabetics and
people with heart conditions. When
she and Beverly discovered that the
Vansants (of Van's Health Food
Store) were retiring, the two women
did someresearch to see ifa new store
downtown would be welcomed into
the community. Their inquiries were
met with a positive response and the
plan for Nature's Garden was cre-
ated.

Beverly, mother ofseven children
(her oldest is at college in Ottumwa
andhertwoyoungest—I9monthold
twin girls— are always waiting for
their mom when she gets off work)
described the ISED program as being
geared towards lowiincome men and
women. The program is offered free
to all those who qualify. Once the
course is over, however, participants
must apply for a loan like anyone

else, although some of the banks in
Poweshiek County do reserve fund-
in g for potential borrowers who have
gone through the ISED program.

Nature’s Garden is definitely not
like any other business. With the help
of Beverly‘s husband, the women put
together the refrigerators and the
freezers: painted the shelves and
bagged countless varieties of flours,
grains,d.ried frutts,and more. In addir
tion, Beverly and Sally make a con-
certed effort to get input from every-
one who sets foot in the store. Sitting
on the front counter is a suggestion
list Mid both women are friendly and
open to any ideas from finding some
one to paint a collage on the wall to
selling banana bread baked by a stu-
dent,

Woman’s History Month is about
celebrating what women have done
and what women can do. These two
women are the first ones of Lheirclass
to open a business. When you see
what Beverly and Sally have accom-
plished at 809 4th Avenue, you will
feel like celebrating. Granola bar,
anyone?

Musings from the gospel

You know how some things really
strike you? Well, I was struck this
Saturday night. I went to the
Gospelfest in Herrick Chapel.

I’ve been to theGospelfestbefore.
Going to events with a religious com»
ponent has been having a certain un-
settling effect on me lately: I realize
how much I am missing as a devout
atheist.

When I was a child, I never par
ticularly thoughtofmyselfas anathe-
ist. I thou ghtthere was probably some
kind of God somewhere, and that I
would someday discover more about
the whole religion thing if I were
meantto.ThenIrealized thatthe only
time I acknowledged the existence of
this deity was when I was in serious
trouble and needed help , i.e., Oh
God, if you exist, don‘t let my horse
decide to check out the bottom ofthis
ravine. That seemed unfair to the es-
sence of religion, to give God all the
responsibility for saving my butt and
none of the credit when things went
well. Sol decided aroundjuntor high
school that I must be an atheist.

I went through a period of fierce
resistance to organized religion. The
main catalyst for this was probably
the stubborn arguments of my Chris
tian friend Kelly. She was and is a
wellrmearting person, butI never did
appreciate being told that] was going
to hell, I tried to ask her if I could
really go someplace that I didn’t be-
lieve in, but she could never answer
thatonc. Sheseemd very strong in her

' beliefs, yet unable to accept criti—
cisms, and I unfairly assumed that
most“religious”peoplewerethatway

Alanna Walen

as well.

Then, as I grew older and more
mellow, in the past two years or so, I
began to appreciate the value of reli-
gion in many of my friends’ lives.
This summer I became friends with a
woman who is working on a Masters
ofDivinity. I realized how imponant
religion is to many people, how much
inner peace and stability it can pro
vide. I sometimes think it would be
very comforting to be able to say to
myself, hey, everything will be okay
because God loves all of us, espe-
cially me.

TheGospelfestbroughtallofthese

thoughts into clear focus. Ikeptwonv
dering if it would bepossible to write
such Sincere, comforting, soulful
songs without basing them on God. I
doubt it. I’m under the impression
that in many cases, ”Negro Spiritu»
als” are songs that were created by
blacks who were workingasslavesor
trapped in economlc conditions that
mightaswellhavebeenslaveryinthe
nineteenthrcentury South. That kind
of history and heritage could never be
captured in a modern effort, particu—
larly without the spirituality that
helped them get up every morning
and go back to work.

IlikegoingtotheGospelfest.Ijust
wish itdidn’tmake me feel soempty
in comparison.

MARCH 6, 1992 '5

Students must have
ability to persuade

Hooray to the Grime]! Spectator!
I find myself in the odd position of
praising Mike Kent‘s article, “The
Myth of Self-Govemment: SGA",
found in the March 2 issue. I have the
advantageoffullyunderstandingSGA
from the inside as well as, this year,
from theperspective ofan “outsider."
and I am in fundamental accord with
Mr. Kent’s discontent.

Like many of my predecessors, I
went into office last year with a great
deal of enthusiasm:
I had wonderful vie
sions of a campus
pulling together
when the adminis-
trationfailedtofully
listen to students. Havtng researched
the role ofSGAon campusbeforemy
election. I was struck by the strength
of conviction found in the student
body during many years of the late
sixties and early seventies. Of course,
SGA then had even less “power,"
responsibilityandmoneyoftentimes,
SGA presidents were fat-bellied
rogues far more adept at creating a
sense of spirit than at effectively at»
tacking issues. Open Forums were
alwayspacked. Attimes, large groups
of studentswould spontaneously con-
verge in the Forum, with SGA repre-
sentatives and officers present, and
demand an audience with Wally
Walker (which he always complied
with). From what I have heard, at a
minimum this was serious fun for all
involvedgbut it was also effective. It

was pan of a continuing process that
slowly [Cd [0 an CVOIULIOH m the role

of SGA. There were no longer sepa-
rate representative bodies for the men
and women of Grinnell. Students for
the first time were represented on
practically all of the campus commit-
tees and decision»making bodies.
Their small numbers (as Mr, Kent
points out is a frustrating aspect of
campus policy) may have ensured
that any direct power to change was
not in the hands ofthe students, but at
least they knew what was going (mi
from the “inside“. Many times
student‘s were vocal enough to nip
disastrous proposals in the bud (I have

often been amazed during committee
meetings at what faculty and admin
istrators assume students want).

In other words, in some respects
Mr. Kent is correct in his assessment
that “students have virtually no [di—
rect] power on this campus," at least
when it comes to affecting policy.
But we do haveapower. Apower that
is inﬁnitely variable in strength ac-
cording to the whims of the current
student body I am, of course, referr

Pedro Fernandez-
McCarthy

ringto dicpoliticalsciencecliche,the
power to “persuade". And we have
proven thatwe can persuadeﬁnot all
of the time, but most of the time, and
notcompletely,butsubstantially (due
to the near-inevitability of compro»
mise in Lrue lockhoms). The more
students are able to discipline and
channel their concerns, the more ef-
fective is this power to persuade.

SGA can facilitate this process,
although its main method of facilita-
tion lies in its ability to assess infor-
mation on how the campus will react
as well as in its subsequent effort to
provide and/or process this informa-
tion for student consumption.

Thus, anyattemptto criticize SGA
for not affecting change by definition
entails a bit of self-criticism as well.
The most appropriate question that

one must then ask conceming the
effectiveness of its student govem-

ment is: “Is my student government
providing mewith adequate informa-
tion about current and proposed ac-
tivitiesaffecting thiscampus,andis it
providing me with adequatechannels
to provide my opinion when I choose
to voice it?“I would argue that yes, it
does.

Lack of communication is a tried
and true campaign issue. It always
works because it is inevitable for a
student to ask of her/himself, when
such an issue is raised, “have I had
