Poll shows need for greater
communication between sexes

By Karen Nutter

Sexual harassment, abuse and tape
occur at Grinnell College. Anyone
who remains ignorant of this sorry
fact must be making a conscious ef-
fort to remain so, for itseems discus-
sion of harassment and assault have
been everywhere for the past several
weeks. Women and men, frustrated
with College procedures for dealing
with harassment and assault cases,
have bombarded the campus with
fonims, graffitti (described as being
either libelous or enlightening, de
pending on who you ask). workshops,
study breaks, and thought-provoking
signs, providing information on ev-
erything from lhedcﬁnition ofrape to
the names of the allegedly most dan-
gerous men atGrinnell, Butwhile we
all agree that harassment and assault
are Serious and painful issues, how
far does our concern extend? Are
students really interested?

The results of an informal poll,
regarding both the issues of campus
gender relations and the currentspotr
lightenharassmentandassault,show
that while students generally agree
that gender relations here are “better
titan at most colleges,” they disagree
on how they may be improved, par-
ticularly with regard to harassment]
assault issues. While some say that
the severity of the issues demands
this spotlight, and that no amount of
attention is too much if it gets both

They feast

sexes to talk, learn and change, other
students wonderifthcsitaution hasn’t
been blown out of proportion, and
speculate on whetherthis mightcause
men and women to be suspicious of
one another.

Students citea general lack of com-
munication between the sexes as be—
ing the main cause of gender prob-
lems. One student commented that
simply “judging from the Burling
bathroom walls, [men and women]
are not thinking along the same lines,
in terms of issues." Most students
believe, however, that this is a soci-
etal, and not a unique, problem, and
that in fact the Sexes hcrc communi-
cate better Lhan in most places. As
stated by one woman, “men and
women don’t understand each other.
Period. But Grinnell people do a bet-
tcr job trying." This emphasis on
relativity was echoed often by other
students, who believe relations are
generally good, and that the sexes
seem to really try to understand one
another, particularly “in comparison
to the rest of society.”

While students seem to be in ace
cord on the State of gender relations,
however, there is great debate on how
the gender issue of harassment/as—
sault should be treated Many stu-
dents expressed the opinion that the
recent focus on harassment/assault
issues “has not blown the situation
out of proportion for the people it's
happened to” and that “valid con-
cerns are being addressed," but there
has been “overkill" in terms of too
much attention to the issue. One
student feared that attention to this
issue was drawing attention away
from other important concerns; “l-Ia-
rassment and rape are here," she
stated, “ and it’s imponant, but.
there are ‘radical feminists‘ that re»
ally blow things out of proportion...
eating disorders and alcoholism are
bigproblems you haven'theard about
either."

While all students questioned be-
lieve that harassment and assault oc~
cur at Grinnell, many do not know
much more about the issue. “If what
we hear is real, it‘s worth voicing,"
said one student who was slightly
suspiciousofthesignsandcommcnts
hehadbeenreadingandhearing.“lt's
worthy of attention to stop it," said
another student, “but how often does
it really happen?" Another student
wanted to know, “What do forums
have to do with anything?" “PAPA?
What's that?" asked an uninterested
female student. Some students ques-

tioned had no idea that Change and
Justice, the group most recently
formed to tackle these issues, oven
existed. Most of thc students ques-
tioned, the above students included,
have not attended any of the work-
shops or forums, generally because
they feel it is not an issue with which
theycanidentify:“Ithasn’thappcned
to me, and it hasn't happened to any-

one I know,so what’sthe pOint in mc‘

going?” asked one woman.

One student who attended the open
forum said her “eyes were opened”
by thcexpcriencc, and thatshewould
nothavcbeennearlyaswellinformod
ifshe hadn’t attended. Students who
were already well-acquainted with
the issue. and angry that the issue had
been “pushed aside” until now, are
pleasedthatpcoplcarcfinally talking
aboutthc issues openly. ”I thinka lot
of necessary changes are happening,"
stated one woman who said she has
heard “seemingly endless stories of
harassment, abuse and violent assault”
in heryears with the Grinnell College
Abuse Support Group.

Students who have not attended
workshops or forums tend to be some-
what cynical of the effect the atten-
tion on this issue would have on gen-
der relations. One student stated that
individually, men and women get
along well at Grinnell, but that when
“people get hysterical about things,"
relationships between the sexes tend
to be more difficult. One male stua
dent, who said he “is fine with rela»
tions on campus,” said he could fore—
see men hating all feminists because
of a few “offensive" feminists, and
women hating men because of a very
small group of them are rapists. He
stressed that he was in no way intend-
ing to equate rapists with feminists.

Commented one student: “No
crime is paid enough attention until
it’s gone." Said one woman, “I think
there is currently an overkill and I
was concerned that people in ight grow
tired of the issue- but I don't think
they have." Many students seem to
agree that there is“overkill," but that
perhaps overkill is necessary in order
to get attention; they might fee] per-
sonally that the issue does not touch
them, but they realize its severity and
support those who wish to make
changes. “The right amount ofattcn-
tion,” one woman explained, "is the
amount that gets people talking."
People should have done it a long
timeago,shestatod,but“we’redolng
itnow, and that’s what'simporiantto

me.

Birthright of Grinnell
advocates alternatives

By Ann Treistman

“If I could tell people one thing
aboutBirthright,"saidJillRobertson,
earnestly loaning forwardtomakcthe
declaration, “It would be that we are
not political at all,”

Robertson is currently the director
ofGrinncll Birlhright, the local chap
ter ofthe international, inlcrdcnomi-
nationalsorviccwhichofferspositive
alternatives to abortion. The
organization’s foundations are in
Canada,whercLouiseSummcrhill,a
Canadian houscivifc,dcclded in 1968
that abortion was too of ten the only
alternative discussed with regard to
unplanned pregnancy. According to
the Charter Document, every chapter
operates under the principle that“lt is
the rightofevery pregnantwoman to
givcbirth,andthcrightofeverychild
to be born.

The Grinncll chapter plans to up-
hold this principle. Thc cozily fur-
nished officeson BroadStreet(pastcl
watercolors of small children adorn
the walls and cushioned chairs give
the appearance ofa neighbor’s warm
apartment) were established in 1986
by a local housewife under the guid»
anceof Birthrightof Iowa. Robcnson
conceded thatithas taken time forthe
local office to become established,
but that the increase in cases handled
(from 3 calls in the first year to 41
calls in 1991), indicates that mem-
bers of the community are utilizing
the service.

Some people are still apprehcn»
sive about Birthriglit. This negative
emotion is unjustified, claimed
Robertson. “Peopleare afraid that we
are politically active because we are
prorlife,“ she explained. “We are not
hereto cause upheaval©© no picket-
ing, no yucky pictures (of bloody
fetuses)...rt‘s in our charter." The
charter requires that members and
volunteers “remain strictly and
seperatcly from all lobbying groups,
and from abortion, affecting abortion
legislation." This policy defines,
”Birlhright'sfunction<€lsone)toholp
pregnant girls and women carry to
term.,.lf we wish to reach abortion-
minded girls, we must avoid getting
involved in the abortion controversy."

Liz Johnson, a volunteer at Binh-
nghi,saidihatmostwomen firstcome
in to talk: “I just listen to determine
what (the woman) is mostafraid of. I
let her know that I’m not going to
judge her, I find out her biggest
concern and what she might decide.
If she felt that abortion was the only
altemative, I’d ask her why she felt
that way.”

Both Johnson and Robertson ex»
pressed their belief that women need
to know of all their options before
making a decision. The charter does
forbid volunteers from mentioning
the possiblity of abortion, however.
This alternative may only be ad-
dressed if the pregnant woman intro-
duces it into the conversation. They
were quick to emphasize that if a

 

woman decides to carry the fetus to

term, Birthright wtll prowdc trans-
portation to medical appointments,
make referrals for adoption services,
and offershclier to women in need of
a supportive environment.

If a woman who wanted an abor-
tion came to Robertson, she stated
without hesitation that she would try
to discourage this choice: “I’d [zilk
about fetal development and show
hcr the (video) tapes [of an abortion
procedure, fetal development, a
woman giving birth]. If the girl says
‘I’m gctunganabortion,’l’d say‘l’m
sorry to hear that, I don’t feel like it's
the right choice for you...but if you
feel like you need support after (the
abortion), please come back."’

“If they want an abortion, we try

and figure outwhy,”she continuedin
hcr soothing, rational tone. “We take
aparteverything that’s piled on top of
her (so that) it isn‘t so overwhelm-
lng."
In addition topsychological stress,
the women are made aware of the
physical aspects ofpregnancy. In the
front hallway, plastic models of a
fetus (nine in all; one for each month
spent in the womb) represent the vari-
ous stages of development. “A lot of
young gals have no idea what's going
on," Johnson reported, adding that
the onemonth model is shown4 times
the actual Size.

Awomanlooking forclothingand
diapers entered theofficesat one point,
and Johnson invited her to look a
through the closet of baby clothes
whichBirthrightrecicvesthroughdo-
nations. Shepromisedtoobtainsomc
diapers, formula, and shoes for the
woman. asking her to return ata later
date. ”We don't have any (shoes)
here rightnow,”Johnson said, assure
ing the woman, “But that doesn't
mean that we can‘t get some."

Birthright is financed completely
through donations from churches,
individuals, and clubs. Both
Robertson and Johnson stressed that
the office would do anything to help
a woman bring a pregnancy to term.

“We will give as much support as
thatgirlnceds,"promisedRobertson.
”We'll go with her to tell her
parents...to tell her b0yfricnd...wc’re
willinglodowhatcvershenoed We
have the time and we are willing to
give her the time."

“ I had a Grinncll (College) stu-
dent move in with me last year. She
was getting a lot of pressure to have
an abortion from friends (and) I of-
fcred her a chance to get away from
that pressure."

Grinnell Birthright is finding its
niche in the community, as seen by
the increase in number of calls re-
ceived. An advisoryboard consisting
of local professionals including a
physician, a lawyer, a college profes—
sor and a chiropractor council the
staff on various issues. The women
who go to Birthright also take advan-
tage of these services.

“The most important thing," sum-
marizedJohnson,“istoletthemknow .
that someone truly cares.”
