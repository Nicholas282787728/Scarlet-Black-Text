WAKE-UP
CALL

No American should go

Exploitation and Obscenity Section
(CEOS), This is a unit within the
U.S. Justice Department, created by
former attorney general Edwin Moese
and originally called the National
Obscenity Enforcement Unit, which,
for the last six years, has conducted a
vastand extialegal campaign to“save
the metal fiber of the United States.”
Do not be fooled by the NOEU’s
1991 name change to the CEOS. Its
work does not and has never focused
on child pornography for the simple
fact that there is very little such may
tetialinexistence in the United States.
ltis the sameerganization, with more
money and the same agenda: to
cleanse the American marketplace of
any materials of a sexual nature, The
CEOS pursues this agenda in delib»
erate defiance of legal precedent, civil
law and the Bill ofRights (this is part
of the littlerknown documentcalled
the Constitution of the Unlled Slates:
theConstitution, surprisingly enough,
remains the highest law of the land
despite its public obscurity and the
contempt of politicians).

CEOS attorneys. many of
whom were originally obtained from

thepro-censorship groupCitizens for
Decency'lhroughLaw,arefullywill-
ing to break the law in their zealous
cmsade to banish sex from the mar
ketplacc. These materials include
Playboys in 7-115, NC-l7-rated and
unrated Videocassettes, and photos
and drawings siczed directly from
artists‘ homes. They pursue their
action whether or not an obscenity
precedent or statute exists for the
area in which they are prosecuting,
and they target clearly legal materi~
als. They flout judicial ethics and
Consititutional law and precedent
with every move they make. In the
words of a CEOS prosecutor: “.,,it
doesn'tmatter if the entire congregar
tion of the First Baptist Church of
Plains, Georgia votes they [retailcd
materials] are not obscene. If they
are sexually oriented. that's it. We’ll
just keep appealing until we get a
conviction or the defendants plead
guilty." With your tax money. In the
words of Robert Showers, the bomr
again director ofthe original NOEU:
“...almost anything that depicts any
kind of nudity, particularly frontal
nudity. male or female, or the depic-
tion of any sex act, is immoral and
obscene...bare breasts are offensive
and repugnant.”

Foils, your money pays for
this sort of thing. While Bob Dole.

I would like to thank Mike
Washburn for his article (Washburn:

column of the September 11 issue of the

amounts to adefense ofthe Rodney King
beating andother misguided and inflam-
matory statements. In my opinion. his
slatements in no way merit a point by
point response. Instead. I thank him for
waking someofus up. The Rodney King

Mike‘sviews, we have ﬁnally begun to

CEOS: War on the Constitution

dowment for the Arts, the base bud-
get for the CEOS approaches two
million dollars a year, and this is a
deceptively small figure considering
that it does not include the vast sums
spent by U.S. attorneys' offices
throughout thccountryaimcd atdrivr
ing businesses into bankruptcy. And
that is precisely what they do in your
country. with your moncy and where
your Constitution still holds sway.
Conducted by hit squads ofprosecu-
tors, this Justice Department
morality’s brigade’s strategy is to
initiatelegalactionsallovcrthecoun-
try which provide ammunition for
countless threats ofobscenity indict-
ments against merchants for selling
materials that are clearly protected
by the Bill of Righl’s guarantee on
free speech. They can and do bring
simultaneous and/or successive suits
against booksellers, publishers. film
makers, and mail-ordcr companies.
They will typically bring charges
against different parts, locations or
subsidiaries of the same company.
and they routinely indict various
employees of these companies and
even members ofthe owner’s family
on obscenity charges even when it is
clear that no conviction can be ob
mined. Business people can find
themselves simultaneously indicted
in several different cities and states,
facing several trials on essentially

the same charge. This is what we
enthusiasts of the Constitution call
illegal.

Thcfactthatanyinitialconr
viction on mostof these cases could
not ultimately stand in courtdoes not
dissuade these protectors of our moral
fiber. Their intention is to drive their
targets into submission and bank-
ruptcy with the horrendous cost of
defending against multiple prosecu-
tions funded by the immense coffers
oftheJustice Department. Legaland
financial harrassment to force the
demise of targeted businesses and
artists is the essence of the CEOS’
strategy, and they do not care about
dueprocess when raiding homes and
businesses. Few defendants can af-
ford to take a stand against this awful
machine, and many agree to outra-
geous plea-bargained settlements.
People in our nation have willingly
given up their Constitutional rights
in exchange for an end to the
harrassment. Even if a business
does actually survive the obscenity
indictment onslaught, they are then
threatened with prosecution under
the RICO (Racketeering Inﬂuenced
and Corrupt Organizations) statute
forallegedly“cngagtnginacriminal
enterpnse." Despite the fact that the
materials in question are clearly lea
gal, the defendant is still forced to
undertake a costly defense And if

as September 1992

the CEOS actually does get a convlc»
tion,then somuch lhcbetterfor them:
the “conservative" (read: statist,
moral majorilanan)communiticswill
set obscenity precedents for the rest
of the country. This lnjusllcﬁ cannot
stand.

The Justice Department's
extra-legal campaign against the
American values of freedom and m-
divtdual choice must be halted be—
fore they actually .sueceed in stifling
the market place, silencing contrary
speech and cooling artistic ambition
in this country. Americans are too
complacent and too ignorant of the
law and [00 unwilling to take a stand
in favor of what is right. If freedom-
loving Americans do not lake '4 Solid

Buddhism, sex and sexism

THINK E R 'S
CORNER

by Gareth Fisher

According to Tantric Bud-
dhism, an enlightened individual is
one who realizes the ultimate false—
hoodoftheexistenceofdualityDnly
the unenlightened individual sup»
poses the existence of polarizing
forces ln the universe. Tantrism en-
gaged in many rituals to help indir
viduals achieve this enlightened ideal
including the unity of males and fe»
males (which the unenlightened mind
would understand as opposites) in
Scxtk’il intercourse.

Ibctyoudidn‘trealizeBud-
dhism was so exciting. Actually, the
topic of this column is not a plug for
the Religious Studies department
(none of the Buddhism courses have
lab periods). Nevertheless, it is an
extremely useful anecdote for the
discussion of gender issues. At this
time, an amendment ensuring the
equal rights of women is yet to be
added to the constitution of the United
States or of any state in the union.
There is no precedent that men and
women have to be treated equally
before the law. This gender inequal-
ity often manifests itself as preju-
dice, as any inequality often does, It
is easy to be outraged when one conr
siders how long gender equality
movementshave been goingon. Yet,

after a brief look at our culture, it
should not amaze anyone that botlt
males and females have yet to be
treated equally before the law. Patrir
archy is nota fire that fuels itself. It
is fuelled by a culture whose mem-
bers treat each gender very unequally.

lnthis very college,wehave
single sex bathrooms, single sex
rooms, single sex floors, and even
single sex groups to help deal with
the problem and reprecusslons of
patriarchy. These are certainly not
parts of our lifestyle we normally
associatewithcausingpatriarchy.but
whatifwedividedracethesameway
we divide gender? Suppose the stu-
dent handbook manadated that every
ﬂoor have seperate bathrooms for
whites and afro-arnerlcains unless a
unaminous floor vote decided to the
contrary? Would we notview this as
tantamount to racism? Why should
we see gender segregation any dif-
ferently?

There is temptation towards
inequality whenever there is discrimi—
nation among two groups. Too often,
an us vs. Lhetn philosophy develops
with prejudice directed toward “the
other”. Because we do not know the
other,andbecausetheodlerisnotus.
we can objectifytheother. Thisis the
same mentality that drives gender
discrimination and results all too of—
ten inprejudiceagainst women in the

political sphere, in the workplace.
and in the form of sexual assault,

I am not suggesting some
form of androgynous ideal. Gender
relationships willalways becomplex
because almost everyone regardless
of gender, sexual identity or sexual
orientation sees one gender very dif-
ferently than another. But we must
becarefulnottoattributctoomuchto
gender differences and we must not
see those differences as incompat-
ible or irreconcilable. We must be
wary ofthe institutions in our society
that promote gender segregation, It
was thought at one time that women
couldnotparticipateinalhleiics,men
could not be sensitive or compas-
sionate, and both sexes could notbe
together on the same side of campus.
let alone on the same floor. We have
proven this wrong. We should also
expect that many of our assumptions
about gender incompatibility will be
proved wrong in the future, includ-
ing the assumption too many people
are making today that men and women
should not have equal rights before
the law. I hope that wherever an
equal riglth amendment is passed, it
may be a springboard for a gender
integrated community, because we
have much to learn about each other,
Such an education could lead to our
enlightenment,
