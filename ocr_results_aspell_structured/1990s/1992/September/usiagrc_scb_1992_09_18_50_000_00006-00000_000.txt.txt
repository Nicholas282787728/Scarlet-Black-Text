Addictive creativity: Naked Lunch a
chronicle of William Burroughs' experience

by Laura Moran

Eversince hedid The F 1y. David
Cronenberg has had a thing for bugs.
And that‘s not all.
HealsohaswhateolumnistMark
Czamecki calls a “vivid obsession
with sex and death," judging on the
basis of his other recent cinematic
contributions, like Dead Ringer:
(1988), Videadrome (1983), and
Stephen King’s The Dead Zone
(1983) Other reviewers frequently
comment on his ﬂair for the bizarre
and unusual sense of the absurd.
With this kind ofreputation, it’s
not surprising that the Canadian di-
rector chose to take on the life and
works of William S. Burroughs, the
infarnouspre-BeatHarvardeducated
'unky novelist. The movie's title is

lhcrciscomesmorcfromBurroughs’
own life and his short stories, such as
“Interzone,” rather than from the
tangled strands of his famous novel
NakedLunch. But however loose Lhe
adaptation, it undeniably works.
When 78-year-old Burroughs him
self saw the first screening of
Cronenberg’smovie,hesaid,“lthink
he’s [Cronenberg] done a greatjob.
Nothingatall like I would have done,
but that’s as it should be."
Evidently, US National Society
othlmCrtticsalsothoughthe’ddone
a great job, because they chose
Cronenberg Best Director, and gave
Naked Lunch the award for Best
Screenplay. Peter (RoboCop) Weller,
who plays the main character in the
film also received excellent re-

 

Hollywood and Hell

by Eleanor Dodson

Ever wonderedif there was any
real difference between Hollywood
and Hell? The Coen Brothers tooka
deep look into the pond of Holly-
woodandcameupwithBarlonFin/c,
a fascinating collection of charac-
ters and images. These images are
largely dark and somewhat unset-
tling, but are mixed with strange
moments of hilarity and absurdity.
Barton Fink is one of 1991’s best
movies and should not be missed.

BartonFink(JohnTurturro)isa
promising young playwright, find-
ing praise and recognition in New
York, who heads off to Hollywood
to find his fortune as a screenwrit ,
He soon finds his artistic sensib -
ties bniised by his new boss, a typi-
cal Hollywood tycoon (Michael
Lerner) and by his ﬁrst assignment,
amn-of-themill wrestling ﬂick. He
turns to an older and wiser writer
(John Mahoney) for help, only to
find his idol has fallen prey to alco-
hol and general despair.

Much of the film is centered
around the hotel where Barton Fink
lives Adark and dreary place,shoes

and not people roam the hallways.
Barton meets Charlie (John
Goodman),agenial traveling sales»
man and wrestling fan, who appears
larger than life next to the ftagile
and perpetually dazed Barton. But
Banon enjoys Charlie‘s company,
for alone in his room, he ﬁnds only
drooping wallpaper and writer‘s
block

VirtuallyeveryframeofBarton
Fink is a interesting image. The
ﬁlm takes every moment and ex-
pands it to loom over the face of
reality, like when Banon rings fora
desk clerk and the bell echoes for
several moments. The suffocating
feeling of Barton’s room is
blown-up to the point of excnieiat—
ing pain, as the heat rises and the
wallpaper falls slowly off the walls,
while the ﬁery climaxjumpsoffthe
screen.

Barton Fink won several
awards at the Cannes Festival in
199 1 . and Michael Lerner was nomir
nated foran Academy Award. It is
the finest attempt so far from the
Coen Brothers. whose other ﬁlms
includeMt'ller' r Crossing and Rat:-
t'ng Arizona.

the disappearance and murder of a

dreaded Castle, which he enters by
crawling through a file cabinet

Shot mostly in black and white,
the film lavishes color on the Castle

WitnessfortheProsecutianis'vintageDietrich'

At the beginning of World War
II, Hitler ordered German-bom US
ﬁlm actress Marlene Dieu‘ich home
to Germany. Deﬁantly, she went to
the US government to offer her ser-
vices in the war effort. She recorded
songs containingcoded messages for
Army Intelligence, sold war bonds at
rallies all over the country, enter—
tained troops atthe frontand filledin
when nurses were in short supply.
Many a returning veteran told in
amazement of having had Marlene
Dietrich as his nurse. In an era when
women were not often politically ac-
tive. Dietrich took her stand against
Hitler.

Witness for the Prosecution, a
firstrratc, suspenseful, court room,

Agatha Christie drama, starts Charles
Laughton in his best role as the
“wigged,” eccentric defense attorr
ney. But our "tip ofthe hat" this time
goes to Dietrich who, as the wife of
the accused comes across in this film
as vintage Dietrich as opposed to the
characterizations she plays in such
films as The Blue Angel and D€:lry
Rides Again,

The film is sponsored by the
Performing Arts Program; the
Rosenfield Program in Public Af-
fairs, International Relations and
Human Rights; and the Louise R.
Noun Program in Women’s Studies,
and can be seen at 9:00 PM on
Wednesday, September 23 in Harris
