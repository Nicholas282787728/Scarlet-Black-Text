Sawyer attends GOP convention

by Howard Horn

On November 3, Grinnoll stu-
dents will yet again go to the polls to
elect new leaders for their govem-
merit. Some students are still unsure
about the candidates for whom they
willvote,whileothcrstireunsatisfied
wilh the candidates from which to
chose. They see the Republicans as
being to conservative and lacking
compassion and the Democrats nstoo
liberal and unrealistic. For Ihose slu-
dents, there may be other options,

Take forexample Jason Sawyer.
Sawyer, a student at Grinnell Col-
lege, is a moderate Republican. “I am
a proechoicc, pran. R. A., Republi-
can. I believe I am full of compas-
sion, and like many other voters. vote
out of self interest, what I feel is best
for the state. and the nation as a
whole.”

Because Sawyer is a Republi-
can, he is often criticized for his be-
liefsontheliberalGrinnellcampusas
being, in Sawyers words,
“uncompassionatc (sic) and out of
touch." Sawyer dispels these nor
tions, because he is more compase
sionate and liberal than most Repube
licans. AmongtheissuesSawyerisin
favor of are: the Balanced Budget
Amendment, the LineeItem Veto for
the president, and term limits for
Congress. Sawyer also advocates the
cutting of the Capital Gains and
Luxury Taxes and is against Bill
Clinton’s 36% tax on the upper»class
because We "need incentive in the
Free Market System,” and taxes take
away incentives. According to Saw-
yer, in America the rich need to be
encouraged, not taxed.because, “it is
the wealthy who invest, create busi»

ness,employpeople,andcrcatejobs."
Sawyer is also against most forms of
regulation.

Because ofhis ties to Iowa Sena-
tor Charles Grassley and his work for
theCollegeRepublicans.Sawyerwas
asked to work at the Republic Na-
tional Convention in Houston. Saw-
yer stood in frontof the Tcxasdelega-
tion and was able to see the whole
convention. He describes the experi-
ence as being very positive despite
some of the offensive things he en-
countered in Houston. At the cone
vention, he was labeled as a liberal by
some and a baby killer by others for

his provchoice stance.

George Bush is the candidate
Sawyer supports for president. His
reasons for supporting Bush come
mostly outofself—interest. Sawyer is
the son of farmers and supports the
North American Free Trade Agree
ment and increased use of ethanol
among other farm issues. Sawyer
also says that Bush is not too consere
vative. “His adrninisn-ationhaspassed
such liberal proposals or endorsed
such things as fire arms limitations
for foreign assaultrifles, the Civil
Disabilities Act, [and] 4.3 billion for
AIDS research...“

Decision '92

Smith the Elector

Don Smiih.prol'essoroihistory, will
be an elector for Governor Bill Clinton if
theDemocratic Presidentialcandidatecar-
rics the state of Iowa.

Smith explained the working of the
electoral college and how electors are
nominated. Every candidate on a Presi-
dential ballm must have the number of
electors that the state has votes in the
electoral college. In the case of Iowa. each
candidate has seven electors. A Slate's
number ofelectors is equivalent its num-
berofrepresentatives in the United States
House of Representatives plus its two
members on the U.S. Senate.

The Democratic party nominates its
electors at its district and state convene
lions. Smith is oneofi'lveCllnmn electors
nominated at the five district party con-
ventions last spring. Electors number six
and seven. electors at large for the state.
were chosen at the state party convenlion.

IfClinton wins Iowa's popular vote.
then he will receive the voles of all seven
ofhis electors in Iowa. Likewise. ifPresi-
dent Bush wins. his seven electors will
castlowa'svotet forhim. In dteeventthat
Clinton wins Iowa. Smilh and Iowa's six
other Clinton electors will go to the Iowa
Secretary of State's ofﬁce in Des Moines
and cast their votes for their candidate.
This voting always lakcsplacc on the ﬁrst
Monday after the second Wednesday in
December.

The ﬁrst order of business for the
newly sealed House of Representatives.
January 6 of next year. will be to hear the
results of the electoral college‘s vote. The
President of the Senale. who is also the
Vice President of the United States opens
the sealed ballots at that Lime and an-
nounces ofﬁcially the results. In the mod-
ern age of communication, this is. of
amuse. a formality. The result or the
election will he known by the morning of
Nov. 4.

In all states save for two. Maine and
Nebraska. thewttincr of thestatei popular
vote receives all o( the state's electoral
vote, Smith explained that in the case of
Nebraska and Maine. a candidate wins the
electoral vote only tor those Congres~
sionaldislrtcts in which hewaS victorious.
The states two alrlarge electors cast their
votes for the candidate who took the big
gest share of the whole state's popular
vote.

In Nebraska. Clinton may win die
district conlaining Omaha. While Bush
may win the votein iheother lwodistricts.
In |his case. Clinton would receive one
electoral college vote from Nebraska and
Bush four (two for the twodisu'iclsand the
slates two til-large voles).

When election years come around.
|here is often talk or replacing the elec»
[oral college. which is often criticized as
both unfairand outdated. wididirectpopue
lar election.

Smith said that he sees “no reason to
abolish the elecloral college until some
persuasive alternative is proposed." He
said that it would not be so simple to
simply instare popular elections for the
Presidency. Questions would have to he
answered ﬁrst. about. who exactly is going
to vote in diese elections. What about
citizens of the United Slates' common-
wealths'l And whatifno candidate wins a
majority? Would We then have to have a
run-off CICCLlon'l

He said that we should be cautious
about deciding on a fundamental change
oronr electoral system when thereisnotn
compelling reason to do so. He also
pointed out that national chiefexecutives
are not typically elected by direct popular
vote. The British Prime Minister, for
example, is the leader of the party that
wins the election. and the decision ofwho
that person will be is made by the party.

 

Howard... and 20 things that disturb him

A special commentary by
Howard Horn

Got a copy of the Grinnell Spectator
yet? If you haven't, pick one up.
Read DougFoster’s article“20Things
That Piss Me Off." It’s good infor-
mation for any aspiring ultra—conser-
vative. Eutremember,Chris Fletcher
advocates that politically active stu-
dents should learn the opposition. It
gives me great pleasure to be that
opposition. Here now are 20 things
thatdisturb me. (I‘m not going to use
the phrase “piss me off.” That would
not be using my family values.)

1) George Bush. Folks, the Congress
isn’t going Republican, and if any-
thing, it’s getting more liberal. So
when you here Bush say things will
change with a new Congress, don’t
believe him,

2) The Nickname Slick Willie. Bill
Clinton is no more slick than Bush is
chicken. They are both very respect»
able men trying to do what is best for
the country. Bush just doesn’t have a
clue what this is.

3)TheTrend ofAnLi-Environmental-
ism. I hate to contradict my friend

Doug Foster, but an environmental
holocaust is a very likely possibility.

just about as often. The price of
stamps went up, didn‘t it?

The problem is thatwe‘re not facing .23) The PostalService. It's a gigantic,

one single problem; environmental
threats come in many forms. It’s not
justglobal warming or ozone holesi
it’s many things. Environmentalism
is a very necessary thing. Oh yeah. it.
is unwise to tell people to commit
suicide when they are trying to pre
Vent you from doing the satne thing.
4) Chuck Grassley. This man is a
weak Senator. He has introduced
very few bills of any consequence
into Congress. He also embarrassed
Iowa with his questioning of Anita
Hill.

5) Jim Ross Lightfoot. For those of
you who think the radical right of the
Republican Party had not infiltrated
any imponant government positions,
you’re wrong.

6) The Grinnell Spectator. The Spoc-
tzttor is an independent paper that is
anything but independent.
7)RepublicanClaimsAbouttheNum-
her of Times Clinton Raised Taxes.
Their claims are true. But, according
to the Republican counting system
formisingtaxes.Bush hasraisedtaxes

tax»revenue black hole. It‘s time to
give maildelivery to private industry.
The price ofstamps will go down and
fedetal subsidies thatwouldhavcwent
tothepostztlservicecanbereinvested.
9) Homophobics. Sexual preference
is nota chosen life-style. It is some-
thing that is thrust upon pcople. Ho-
mosexuals have no choice as to
whether they will be homosexual or
not, just as women, African Ameri-
cans, and chshavclittleornochoice
to be what they are. Therefore, to
disapprove of the life-style of a ho—
mosexual is hatred to thesamedegree
as sexism, racism. and anti-semitism
are.

10) Family Values. Whatdoes“fam-
ily values" mean anyway? All I can
see is that it is a term the Republicans
coined in order to promote their sex
ist. racist. homophobic views.

11) Clearance Thomas. Forget Anita
Hill for a moment. Do you believe
this man? He IS anti-abortion. It
seems that the Republicans told Tho-
mas tokeep his mouth shuiso that the

Supreme Court can get yet another
Conservative.

12) The Voucher System. For those
of you who were unaware. this coun-
try has a First Amendment that pro-
tects peoples rights against the fortn-
ing ofa nationalchurch. Thevoucher
system. which would give financial
support for religious schools, is un-
constitutional.

13) The American Conservative. All
this tabloid seems to do is bash op—
posing candidates.

14)James Baker. ChrisFletcher wrote
thatPat Robenson is the greatest threat
to America. Idisagree; James Baker
is. This man has worked undercover
to try to destroy Israel. When he took
over Bush's campaign, he succeeded
in producing liesandtuming thecam-
paign very negatively. No oneknows
what else this man is capable of do
ing. And, he has enough support to
possibly win in 1996.

15) No on Amendment 1. That isjust
positively stupid. Women deserve
equal rights. And folks, the E. R. A.
does not promote iax»funded abor-
tions. That‘s just Republican propa-
ganda.

16) People Who Fear Tipper Gore.
Al Gore does not support his wife's
position on record labeling. Also, the
ViceePresideni'swifeholdsnopower.
17) Religion. Want to know a good
way to help reduce the deﬁcit? Tax
the church (or any non»charitable re-
ligious function.) It’s about time we
got all religion out of govemment.
18) Dan Quayle. Vote for Bush, and
this man is one heartbeat away from
the presidency.

19) People Who Criticize Govem-
merit. If you have a problem with
government, get involved. You can
vote, work for a party, work for can
didales, and lobby.

20) People Who Criticize the Scarlet
and Black. If you have a problem
with the Scarlet and Black, get in
