Only for the hardcore, strictly for the headstrong

by Adam Kashuba

In case you haven't hwd about
the techno revolution sweeping the
world, I‘m here to clue you in. I’m
from Chicago where the techno/rave
scene is in HS infancy, not like out on
the West Coast or in New York or
London, where techno has been a
way of life for more than 10 years.

Since techno is a completely and
fundamentally new music genre, I
ought to tell you somehisiory.Techno
began in the basements and ware—
houses of Chicago’s South side in its
first incarnation as House. It then
moved across the ocean to England
where it became pan of the Acid
House scene of the 19805. That in
turn inﬂuenced DJ 5 and producers
over here. namely Derrick May of
Inner City (incidentally, “Big Fun" is
called the first techno song), to create
anew sound based on faster beats and
minimalistic lyrics. Once again this
moved overto Englandand the restof
Europe and became techno as we
know it today.

As for what it sounds like, take
your favoriteHouse record and speed
the BPM (beats per minute) to around
140. Take out any substantial lyrics
and replace them with samples from

Hungarian movie in

weird movies or House songs or cho-
ral chants (a song by Apothcosis, for
instance, samples Carl Orff’s famous
CarmiMBumna)andyou’vecreated
a techno track. Other songs mix in
Waltzes, the theme from Sesame
Street, the Tctris song, or the James
Bond theme. Among some of the
more Wellrknown groups is Altcm-8
whose bands members claim that for
their “Full On...Mask Hysteria” air
bum, they worked up some tracks in
a few hours with a computer, a dmm
machineandakeyboardin someLon-
don ﬂat. Other groups work a whole
day on their tracks. Really.

But why the hell is techno impora
tant'.7 After all, it’s all computer gen-
erated synthesizer and bass. First,
according to Matt Adell of Reactor
Mega-Magazine, Chicago’s first and
only mag devoted to the Chicago
techno/rave scene, music made with
a computer is just information trans-
lated into sound. Furthcn'nore, as
techno anisis/DJs like Moby point
out, techno, by its rhythmic nature,
gets one in touch with their inner
selves, and as the techno group The
Sharnen would add, the bass cans“
one to lose track of oneself while
dancing to the same heat as 1000
other people ata rave, and gets one in

and creative intricacies which made
them such darn good reads The God-

the movie is actually superior to the

herein America you need to hitLAor
New York to get more than 1,000.
The raves I attended over the summer
were a comfortable 700-800 people.
When you get that many people in a
small space, with deadly bass and a
pulsating light show, the scene be-
comes tribul and shamenistic in na-
ture, hence the above theory of get-
ting in touch with your inner self and
the selves of the people around you.

The ravc scene in this country is
still in its early stages, but it is grow-

Film: Stagecoach

Film critic Anthony Thomas
says oflohn Wayne, 'He cannot be
compared with any other figure in
film history. He had a presence that
was all his own. Although heplayed
a variety ofrolls, it was in Westerns
that he excelled, possibly because
viewers saw him as the perfect realr
ization of the Western hero."

Bom in Winterset,lowa,Wayne
broke into film with the help of
Western star Tom Mix, who adr
mired his play on the USC football
team and got him bit parts in B
Westerns at the Fox Studios. How—
ever, it was not until director John
Ford chose him to play in Stage-
coachlhathiscareerwascstablished.
Ford’s skill as a director enabled
Wayneto portray characters of more
complexity than he had previously
attempted, and after the success of
Stagecoach, Ford and director
Howard Hawks utilized and develr
oped Wayne’s talent in what critic
Thomasrcfers to asa“procession of
truly remarkable Westerns"7
among others,[€cth'ver, She Wore
a Yellow Ribbon. Fort Apache, Rio
Granule. Rio Laba and The Man
Who Shot Liberty Valence.

Thomas says, “Wayne was to-
tally believable as a cowboy, a
drifter, or a cavalry captain. He was
perfect. lfthelncn ofthe Wild West
didn’t look like John Wayne, mey
should have.”Stugecoach will show
Wednesday, 14 October, 9:30, in
the Harris Center Cinema.
