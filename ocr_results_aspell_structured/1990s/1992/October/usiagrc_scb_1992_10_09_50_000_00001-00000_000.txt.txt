Pro-righteousness

by Riva Sharples

“I like being female. I like being
a woman." said Constance
Muhammad to a crowd of Grinnell
students October 7 during a lecture
entitled “Black Feminism'li" “There
is something in me that has a unique
Chataclerislic~somelhing in me that
gives me a sense of balancksomer
thing that makes me proud of who I

A minister in the Nation oflslam
[tom Des Moines. Muhammad sug-
gested to the crowd that the words
“black" and “feminist" do mgth to-
gether,“ I am here in Grinnell talking
to those who have made their minds
available to be molded ," she said. “i
am talking to students who talk about
the idea of “feminism,” lam talking
to people who have embraced femi-
nism, apolitical idea geared at reliev—
ing pain. Feminism is an alternative
cultural solution It goes against the
very nature of a black woman." The
black woman is the mother of civili»
zation. according to Muhammad.

Womanhood. she said, was or-
dained, decided. and designed by Al-

lahi" Women in the black society
have a responsibility to get in tune
with nature," she said. “The Moslem
su-ives hard to be in submission of the
will of Allahwf God. Moslem
women especially have an imponant
role in this"

Muhammad spoke against abor-
tion and premarital sex. 'In the Is-
lamic culture. she said, people don‘t
even need to think about being “pro-
life" or “pro-abortion“ because it
never comes up “We are pro-righ»
lqul’lESS.

We don’t need [cminism in the
Nation of Islam because our women
have already been freed. By' embrac-
ing Islam. I feel the most ,free I’ve
ever felt. Ey embracing Islam. i feel
that the black women is free tobewho
she really'is," ,

Muhammadencouragedwomen.
especially the black women in the
audience. to take a “hard look at your»
selves." “You need to spend some
timereﬁning morals,"she said. “You
need to look at mis culture in truth.
Surely. surely, there is enough brain
power in this world to make male-
female relationships work without
eliminating the sexes.”
