Consider voting Republican; Ostergren explains why

by Alan Ostergren, 5&3

it would be a safe bet to say that most
Grtnnell students will vote straight Demo~
cralic in this election. to like to propose that
you do something that you miyll not other-
wise consider, voting Republican.

I’d like to start out by suggesting a few
things that we should keep in mind; as cfﬁytt
now the US is the wealthiest nation in the
world, our workers are more productive that
those in Germany or Japan, we have had StX
straight quarters of economic growth (+21%
this quaner), unemployment is on the way
down,housillgstansareup.realincotllelsup.

to recovery. The whole focus ofthe Presiden~
tial campaign has been the economy, Bill
Clinton has slated repeatedly that America is
a nation in decline. he ntns ads which mix
statements made by President Bush with star
tisticstrom a different time to prove his pomt.
He states repeatedly that PresidentBush isthe
worst president in economic terms than any
president in thelast titty years, This statement
is simply a be. When using the Index of
LeadingEoonomlcltldicators.Pt-esidentCarter
had the worst performance of the last ﬁfty
years. President Reagan had the best and
President Bush is in the middle. To claim
otherwise is no more than a direct and know

ing misrepresentation of the tntth.

There arereatly two reasons lorour most
recent econornlc problems, one global, one
domestlct The entire world has entered a
general recession. it is a normal aspect of
economics that economies will surge and dc.
eline, we should expect that periodically the
entire world thl go through a tough period. it
defies reason to say that the President of the
United Slates alone has enough power or In-

have gained many beneﬁts from ourcxtensive
economicintetaclton withthe rcstoftheworldt
but a cost of that is that we, to at least some
dcgree.wttl surge ordcclineas the world does.

The second reason for ourpasl problems
was a piece or legislation called the two
Budget Compromise. The Democtatic leads
ership came to the President with a proposal
for the largest tax increase in American his-
tory, over $230 Billion. The President was in
the middle of dealingwith the GulfWar when
this budget battle began, The President relate
tried that the political nature of the situation
was that he would be forced to compromise
with the Democratic leadership lie forced
them to cutlheir lax increase bymore than half
and to agree to the largest spending cut in
history and other procedural changes that
would help reduce both the sin of the deficit
and oftlteFederal government. Belore the ink
had dried on the bill. the Democrats had al»

ready staned to break their promises. The
procedural changes that were agreed to were
never made, the spending cuts were never
made. and when all the dust had settled. the
Democraticallyconuollcd Congress had spml
31,83 for every 81,00 that was raised, With
that kind of leadership in Congress, it was no
wonder that we were headed for a recession.
President Bush realizes that it was a mistake to
trust Congress and agree to atax increase He
has admitted his mistake, and he has learned
from it He knows now. probably better than

It is not merely the theoretical basis of

and hrgh taxes are bad, it is what we can see
Irom pracucal experience. it is a undeniable
fact that from the time of President Reagan's

notnic gowth, both in terms of GNP and real
income (By the timeofthe Budget deal wehud

about the largest tax increase in history, $220

To the editor,

Although I appreciate Michael
McKibbin's compliment and its input on

forwarded to the Native American Inter-
cst Group, lfeel it is necessary to speak on
the subyect of debate at Grinncll as well,

had he wished to do that) but to inflame
drescnsibilitiesofthe Grinnellleft. This
very effectively created an environment
in which Mr. McKibbin could ponray
himself as rational and openrminded,
while his opponents could not restrain
themselves from angry comment. He
knew his audience.

My counterpoint was simply that
there were other, earlier, “stories ofman.
kind," and I attempted to tell the Native

American story using the samcevocalive
words (courage, discovery, empire) used
in his speech in order to point out the true
whimsy ofhis statements, The tact that
he took my point seriously as as much an
indication ofhis lackofsclfeawareness as
it is or his openrmindedness, One does

speech.

LastMonday evening, at thediscus-
sion on Columbus Day sponsored by
NAIG, I felt compelled to leave in the
middle ofthe affair after an angry remark
to the audience. I would like to take this
opportunity to use ulepages of the Scarlet
andBlack to defend my actions andmake
it clear to those present thatl was not
merely closing my mind permanently to
an opposing viewpoint.

The events leading up to my deparr
ture were symptomatlcot. but notentircly
the cause ofthatexit. The discusston had
evolved into a discussion as to why I had
felt my psychological defense mecha-
nisms activate during the discussion of
the Columbus debate. and I was slowly
moving away. albeit gradually, from my

ticularly at forums such as the NAlG

was quickly to change. During the
evening, I had made my opinions clear.
they had been questioned, and I had, in
some cases, formulated syntheses of the
two. However, this debate, irrational at
times, as all in attendance will probably
admit, was not the cause of my outburst
and quick exit from the forum.

The problem occurred in thus. After

subject had been anived at rationally.

tions, and that I tell myself adequately

the participants of the forum, active in

I had ‘studlcd properly', and several oth»

There is a difference between the
skillful use of words and debate. Mr.
McKibbin,youskillhrllymaniputarodthe

cussion. However, when people begin to
question personal crafts. such as my intelr

reach myself about the issues. let alone
understand them, I must react. ln my
situation, my only recourse was to aban-
don the discussion altogether.

This is not to castigate all those
present. There were several members or

sented in a rational way which, in turn
caused me to think. and modify my posi-
tion. For example, an eloquent speech by

polarized, witlt both sides moving to more
radical extremes, and neither camp will-
