Helping Washbum unleurn his ruclsm

He has been notorious for un-
abashedly venting out his racist re-
sentments. ChristopherFletchercalls
him eloquentand coherentin the pre-
senmtion of his arguments. Scott
Wittstruck thinks his arguments are
flawed , but that he is not a racist
because he hasn’t used a pejorative
term like“nigger." ButI bluntly refer
to him as paranoid, close—minded and
ignobly racist. This is the umptecnth
time thatI have had to use such harsh
language for Mike Washbum. It is
certainly not apleasant duty for some
body who is polite and believes all
peopledeserve to be treated With their
due respect. But to borrow from
Bush,I believe that Washbum‘s des-
picable racism should not stand. So
long as he continue to insult Black
people, I’m ready to take him on.

For anyone who reads
Washbum’s columns, I need not ex-
plain why he shouldbe labeled by the
‘R' word. He is the man who lands
the former Klan leader David Duke
as a hero but calls Nelson Mandela a
villain. He is the man who applauds
apartheid as benign and European
colonialism as great because Black
Africans have shown themselves con»
sistently asincompetentto nilethem-
selves. He is the man who contempr
tuously refers to Desmond Tutu and
other Black leaders as people who
make their careers off of white guilt.
He is the man who calls Europe the
place of law and order, and Africa a
continentoflawlessnessandcamage.
Who else can be called a racist if a
man with such prejudiced opinions
can not?

What is more, Washbum, in do
fense of David Duke calls Blacks in
Louisiana indolent folks with deca—
dent valuesﬁwho live on welfare at
the expense of the toil and sweat of
working class Whites. He ponrays
African Americans asabunch of fail-

ures consumed in a culture of drugs
and violence, He has even praised the
racistWhite professorleiirey Levins
as courageous and admirable for his
theories about Blacks as genetically
lacking in intellectual ability. Does
this man have ID say “nigger" before
we understand that he is insulting
Blacks? But instead ofplain talk to
help him unleam his racism, we have
responded with awkward silence or
only tepid rebuke, at best.

Confucius, the revered Chinese
patriarch, was right when he said that
fools take insolence for courage.
Washbum would be foolish to think
his racist insultsare an actofcouiage.
You have to be ignorant to be racist,
butWashbumdoesn’tundcrsmndthat.
He thinks himself very knowledger
able because he can write long ar-
ticles and quote from a thousand and
one racist authors he has read, And
rather than acknowledge some of his
shortcomings from his numerouscrit—
ics, or at least give them an audience,
he foolishly tells them that they can’t
write English, as if he were aprofes-
sor emeritus of English. He com-
plains bitterly that ] slander him by
calling him a racist, but he does not
understand that his bigoted remarks
infuriate Blacks and make himself
guilt-stricken to the degree that he
cannot even make eye contactwith a
single Black student or faculty mem-
ber on this campus. He is deﬁnitely a
man full of hate, and he shamelessly
wears his hatred.

It was kind of ironic that in his
column two weeks ago. he presented
a long list of people he considers
racists, citing Malcolm X as must
numera two. What was obviously
missing from his list was his own
name. I would reserve my long trib-
ute to Malcolm X fornexttime, but in
brief: as bad as his critics labor to
make him look, Malcolm X undoubtr
edly remains a great Black here. His
detractors cloud his plausible mes-
sage of self—reliance and selfrdisci~
pline with his incendiary attacks on
Whites—remarks he later admitted
himself were wrong. History has
vindicated his noble and selﬂess cfr
fort forjustice for his people: now the

industry. Malcolm X has gained his
rightful place in history. We don‘t
need a hardcore racist like Washbum
to tell us that Malcolm X can‘thc a
hero because he supported Castro or
because he once preached hatred
against WhllCS.

This in nineteen hundred and
ninety-two: people still singing the
old-time song of racism should be
made to understand that they are way

behind the times. They are like the
mythical Perri VanWinkle who slept
for twenty years amid momentous
changes that would awaken even a
corpse, Regardless of the numerous
reports of racial violence we read
everyday, the world has made re-
markable progress in becoming more
racially tolerant. We have come a
long way from slavery to emancrpa»
lion , colonialism to independence,
segregation to integration, and now

from apanheidtoncgotintion on Black
majority rule. But this is not to deny
that we still have many Washburns to
educate. There have been many re
ported cases of hate crimes even on
this campus, ranging from the draw-
ing of swnstikas to racial slurs by
anonymous individuals. So we cer-
tainly have a job to do in educating
each other on metal attitudes. I hope
more people will eschew passivity
and join in this ongoing task.
