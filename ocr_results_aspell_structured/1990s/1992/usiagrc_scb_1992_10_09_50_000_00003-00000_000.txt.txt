Responding to an incident last
month in which an official of the
State University of New York at
Oneonta released a list of black stu-
dents to aid a police investigation,
GrinnellCollegeRegistrar Roger A.
LasleystronglyreaftinnedGn'nnell’s
strict ban on making information in
student records available to outside
authorities or individuals.

The Oneonta incident stemmed
from an attack on an elderly white
woman in the predominantly
Caucasian community located in the
Catskill Mountains of New York
State. The woman described her as-
sailant as a black man. and reported
that she had cut his hands and wrists
in resisting his attack.

At the request of local and state
police, the university‘s acting presir
dent furnished a list of black students
to detectives, who went from dorm to
dorm, rousing students from bed and
taking them from showers. The in4
vestigators asked the black males to
voluntarily display lheirarms for in-
spections, although none were de-
tained for further questioning. A
counselor at the school, Edward
Whaley,wasfurious. “Theonly prob-
able cause they [police] had was.
‘You’re black, you're a suspect,”
Mr. Whaley said. The administra-
tion apologized to the students after a
storm of protest from faculty and
students alike.

Registrar Lasley called the
Oneonta affair “a worst case," and
cited the lengthy Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974.
which speciﬁcally limits the student
information an institution can dis-
close. Ethnic descriptions of stu-
dents are forbidden, Lasley said, and
he added that most private colleges

willnoteven release thebasic”direc-
tory information“ that the Privacy
Act allows

Mr. Lasley stated that his office
will only cooperate with informa-
tional requests ﬁled by Federal agen-
cies, such as the Depanrnent of Edu-
cation; cooperation that is mandated
by law. Lasley said that he does not
respond to subpoenas issued by outv
ofrstate courts. Generally, Mr.Lasley
said that the College “drags its feet”
in releasing any material from stu-
dentftles,and he seeks approval from
CharlieDuke,theCollegcVicePresi-
demand PameJaFerthson, thePresir
dent of the College, before making a
ﬁnal decision.

WhileMr.Lasley hasneverbeen
presented with a formal subpoena
fromlocallaw enforcementofficials,
he acknowledged that the Grinnell
Police Department had approached
him within the last year seeking his
assistance with an investigation. Mr.
Lasiey refused. citing the 1974 Pr
vacy Act, and has not been asked by
the Department to divulge informa-
tion since that time.

Mr. Lasley further noted that the
College‘s protection of student prir
vacy extends into the private sector
aswcll. Grinnell,although notbound
by the 1974 Act in this area, refuses
to sell or provide studentlists to busi-
ness vendors or nonprofit concerns.
Although the government bans the
production of subsets of student in»
formation, such as the list of black
students in the Oneonta matter, a
school can deliver an entire list of
enrolled students to aperson request-
ing or purchasing the information.

This practice came under scrur
tiny recently after a spate of killings
around the Gainesville campus of the
University of Florida, Using a list
provided by university officials, who
were required by a state law to sell

Black talks to EAG

meeting Monday evening. Black in
heritcd this voting district of
Poweshiek County in the recent re-
apportionment of Iowa voting dis-
tricts. He spoke to EAG about his
experience and interest in environ
mental issues.

Black proclaimed at several
points in his casual talk that, “Corpo-
rate America is mining America."
His charged was based on the allega—
tion that corporations do not have
any concern for the environment,
that their main concern is profit. He
spoke of several issues which Grin-
nell students are very familiar with.
clear cutting the forests in the west,
the ozone layer, and farming’s envi-
ronmental hazards.

Black said, “Agriculture is the

biggest environmental challange for
Iowa." He spoke of trying balance

from farmers that they are subjected
to too many regulations. Black felt
that,“the keytoagrieulture is getting
an appropriate price for your prodv
uct,"Blackexplalncdthat,inhisopinr
ion, if farmers got an appropriate
amount of money for their crops.
instead of, what he appraises to be,
the low prices they currently get.
they would be more able to farm
more “environcmentally”.

To explain his position on gov-
ernment making environmental
policy Black quoted a statement
which be attributed to President Lin-
coln, “The govemment must do for
the people what they can’t do for
themselves.“ Black seemed to most

store owner sent a mailing to parents
of Florida students, advertising his
stock of weaponsand suggesting that
students at the Gainesville campus
were unsafe. Many parents with-
drew their children from the school.
andanumbercited fears raised by the
mailing as the reason.

Mr. Lasley, who noted that nu—
merous conferences and symposia
are held for registrars every year to
help them address the complexities
of the privacy issue, believes that
Grinnell’s hard line policy of not

providing information forany reason

is the easiest way to avoid the pain
and anger experienced recently in
Gainesville and Onoonta.
