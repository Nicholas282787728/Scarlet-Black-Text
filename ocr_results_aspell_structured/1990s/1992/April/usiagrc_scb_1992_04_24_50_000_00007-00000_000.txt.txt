CHANGE and JUSTICE is a
group that recently fonnetl in re
sponse to student concerns about
rape, sexual assault, and sexual ha-
rassment, and the college policies
relating to these issues. We have
divided into two committees:
CHANGE and JUSTICE.

The CHANGE committee will
speciﬁcally address the issues of
advocacy and education as pertain-
ing to sexual violence on campus.
A long term goal ofthis committee
is to provide the students With a
centralized body of resources and
referrals concerning sex/sexuality,
as well as sexual violence. The

tion program for New Student Days
as well as ongoing campuseducation.

The JUSTICE committee will fo-
cus on reforming thejudicial process
as relating to rape,sexualassault,and
sexual harassmentcharges.IUSTICE
is preparing a list of recommenda-
tions for speciﬁc reforms to present
to the college administration. JUSV
TICE has already submitted a student
initiative to crcateaPresidentialTask
Force. This task force will address the
shortcomingsofpresentcollegepoli—
cies thatdcal with sexual violence on
campus.

CHANGE and JUSTICE hold a
common belief that the present sys»
tem is inadequate, and it must be
changed NOW. The present poli-
cies perpetuate ignorance ofsexual
violence issues on campus and deal
ineffectively with specific prob-
lems. Our purpose is to create a
system which will serve our com
pus community effectively in both
the prevention and prosecution of
sexual violence.

DINOSAUR DAYS
Pro—choice isn't just one choice

I had no idea that we had mothers
at Grinnell. I suppose that ifI’d ever
thought about it, I would have real-
ized that of course there must be at
least one female student who had
gotten pregnant and chosen to carry
the fetus to term. Meeting wtth
Daurice Coaster really forced me to
confront the assumptions which I’d
always made. Especially the assump-
tion that any intelligent woman atr
tending an institution ofhigher leam-
ing would opt for an abonion rather
than having to sacriﬁcehereducation
(aslsaw it) in ordertocare forachild.

Daurice faces this sort of preju-

Ann Treistman

dice every Lime she steps on campus
with her son in her arms. Grinnell
caters tochild adults whose meals are
prepared and bathrooms are cleaned
by B and G. The administration will
not allow Daurice to enroll Isiah in
the campus daycare center. There are
no scholarships designed for young
mothers. In fact, Daurice had to fight
to live off campus as a sophomore.
The Office of Student Affairs would
not let her obtain a lease until she’d

actually given birth and brought in a
doctor's note verifying the situation.

With two academic scholarships.
Daurice can afford to continue her
education at Grinnell. Isiah attends a
daycare center in town, with other
children of working parents. He sees
his father every week and both par-
ents try to spend as much time as they
can with their son. Daurice does not
lead an easy life. She has a tight
schedule: classes, Isiah, and a part-
time job. With the help of supportive
friends, however, she isable to l“ ggle

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Computer Services lacks support

To the editor,

Grinnell College is one of the top
liberal arts institutions in the nation.
Additionally, we have some of the
best computing facilities, especially
for a college of this size. Grinnell
CollegeComputchervices(GCCS),
theadministrativebranchresponsible
for running, supporting, and upgrade
ing the computer facilities here, has
put together a network with some of
the most advanced hardware availr
able.Lastyear,thcrewerefourpeople
rwponsible for supporting academic
computing. Currently there are only
two. This lack of staff will reduce the
quality of support for the computer
system.

To introducenew students to com-
puting at Grinnell, a workshop is of-
fered which provides the information
required for them to write a paper
using Grinnell’s computers. Though
the uaining does notprovide the edu-
cation required to make a student
comfonable on all of the systems
(many more hours must be spent than
any first year student has time to
devote), it has proven adequate. For
the past few years, Diana Clay has

been responsible for providing this
training. She left computer services
in January to pursue other goals. A
replacement has not been found yet.

Support, in addition to training, is
required. For students, the main sup
port staff is not the full time employ-

ees. Instead, in order to provide addi
tional support for the students, GCCS
hires students as User Consultants
(UCs). UCs are responsible for most
of the support provided to the stu-

SCRATCHINGS OF A
MAD MAN

A vote against corruption

Thisyear’sseniorclassisgraduat-
ing to the worst white»collarjob mar-
ketinatleast18years.Itisagrim note
on which to end the school yuir, and
4 years of education at a place that
compared to much of the rest of the
world, guarantees for its students a
relatively charmed existence. There
is also an election coming up this
November - with rcdtstttcted Con-
gressional seats, 2 senate races in
Califomia and a President to get rid
of.

This last remark is hardly glib.
George Bush, elected on a ticket of
creating a thousand points of light by
letting ‘cm fry more kindly and gen~
tly without charging the general pubr
lie any extra for the service, has sur-
passed even Richard Nixon in the an
of underhand skulduggery. He has
emasculated environmental laws and
anything else that happens to annoy
him in the sole name of helping out
the tiny minority at the top who were
the prime beneficiaries of
Reaganomics. He is now in the pro-
cess of consigming the United States
to a world-wide agreement, the Uni-
guay Round of the General Agree-
ment on Trades and Tariffs, which
will deprive the United States of its
national sovereignty in economic
policy . in the sole name of helping
out that same tiny minority.

He is also responsible for eco-
nomic ineptitude in the ﬁrst degree.
Heabandoned Gramm-Rudmatt deft-
cit reduction and his now infamously
cheap “no new taxes” pledge in the
name of allowing the continuing
dominance over Congress of special
interest groups who believe in wet-
fare for the upper-middle class. And
hedidnothing in thefaceofamountr
ing recession and a historic threat to
the country’s fuel supply to institute
national industrial, economic and
energy policies to ease the way
through the hard times and use re-
sources more efﬁciently.

As you may have figured out by
now, he has also shown himself utr
terly devoid of any noble principle

whatsoever. While the Supreme Court
was supporting abortion rightsin Roe
Vs Wade by a 7-2 margin, Bush was
working hard forPlanned Parenthood.
As soon as abortion went out of fash-
ion with the Republican party and
Bush sensed his overwhelming per—
sonal need to be President of the

Daniel Bliss

United States, he dropped Planned
Parenthood like a stone and lined
himself with the most rabidly anti-
abortion elements of the fundamen-
talist lobby he could ﬁnd. When it
was fashionable to criticise Carter’s
$40 billion deﬁcit and double—digit
inﬂation, it was also appropriate to
criticize anything that smacked of
ﬁscal irresponsibility. Hence that fa-
mousdescriptionofRonaldReagan’s
promise to cut taxes and increase de—
fence spending - “voodoo econom-
ics”. Then, having served under
Reagan’sidioticregimeforeightyears
and having campaigned for "no new
taxes“ in 1988,he sponsoredabudget
agreement that effected the unlikely
combination of raising both taxes and
the deﬁcit simultaneously.

This is no mere panisan rant. I
voted for anakis in 1988, but that
has little to do with this. If Bush had
merely failed the people who voted
against him, his re-election mightbe
understandable, even ifsuch a failure
was deliberate. He would still have
worked hard enough for a large
enough proportion of the American
people to earn their votes in Novemr
ber. However, he has also failed most
of those who voted for him or for no
one at all. It is hard to believe he still
has a constituency, He surely does
not deserve it.

Unfortunately,theDemocratshave
not helped the cause of removing
Bush from the White House. After a
primary campaign which was pre»
ceded by the spineless withdrawal
