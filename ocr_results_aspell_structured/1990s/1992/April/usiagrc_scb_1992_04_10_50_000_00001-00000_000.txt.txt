SCARLET & BLACK

 

By Joshua Ford

Around fifty Grinnell students
traveled to Washington D.C. last
weekend to attend the National Orga-
nization for Women’s “March for
Women's Lives" on April 51h. The
march itself attracted between
500,000 and 750,000 people to pro-
test for abortion rigth and reproduc-
tive freedom. The march comes at a
time when a conservative Supreme
Court seems ready to either overturn
or Severely limit the landmark 1973
“Roe v. Wade" decision which made
first trimester abortions part of a
woman’s right to privacy.

Jen Kem, one of the organizers of
theGrinnellcontingent,cxpressedthat
there was a certain sense of “immi-
nenl doom" that distinguished this
most recent march from the last one
in 1990, which came on the heels of
the "Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services ," and gave states the rightto
regulate abortion.

However, the march itself was
described as “empowering,” giving
channel to women’s rage and provr -
ing a sense of affecting the political

atmosphere. That rage, which in some
ways echoed anti-incumbent senu'A

merits around the country, was di-
rected largely at President Bush and
members ofthe Congress and Senate
with chants like, “We’re women, we
vote and we’re pissed of .”

also noticed greater male representa

to the realization of many men that
they have a common stake in the

Many of the signs carried by the

with sullements like, “If you can't

At a rally on the mall following

on topics of abortion rights and

Policy on rape reviewed, disputed

By Chris Maag

Graffiti on the wall of the female
bathroom in Burling Library has
sparked a campus-wide controversy
over the cffectivencssof the college's
policy towardsrape and harrassmnent,
as well as the appropriateness of mak
ing public accusations about sexual
misconduct.

Two forums have so far been held
on the subject, one on Wedneesday
nightinlheStonewallReScOurccCcnv
ter and one last night in the Forum.
Wednsday'swomenvonly forum con-
centralcd on the feelings about the
graffiti, while the open forum held
lastnightfocused on specific changes
people would like to see made in the
Presidential Hearing Board Process.

“Part of the fnlstration comes from
just a lack of satisfaction with the
process. I know a lot of women who
don‘t trust the hearing board process
to come up with a fair ruling, so a lot
of them are lef t with noother recourse
man to write these things on the wall,”
said Alanna Walen, an organizer of
Thursday’s forum.

Charges of rape and sexual
harrassment first go to the Student
Affairs ofﬁce. The office helps the

eomplaintant decide whether he or
she wishes to press charges. If charges
are pressed, both Lhe complaintant
and the defendant write statements
and make cases for the Presidential
Hearing Board. Each person is also
given an adviser who helps them
through the process. The board de-
cides the defendant‘s guilt or inno-
cence, and recommends possible
sanctions to the president. The presi-
dent can accept, reject or modify this
recommendation, and both the stu~
dents then have seven days to appeal
that decision.

“Our proceedures are very good
proceeduresmurproceeduresdwork,”
said Associate Dean of Student Afr
fairsJennifer Krohn. “Through those
proceedures there is a forum for stu-
dents to adress these issues.” Krohn
and the rest of Student Affairs are
making plans to increase the number
of programs and workshops on cam-
pus dedicated to educating students
about sexual relationships and the
expectations the college has concemr
ing sexual conduct. Many students,
however, doubt this will help im-
prove the hearing hoard process.

“The writing on the walls is a
product of frustrastion with the pro
cess. There is not a process here that
works or the students trust. These
women who are doing this feel that
this is the only way that what hapr
penedlolhem can havcanyrelevence
to anyone else on campus,” said
Heather Heimbuch, who after her
experience with the hearing board
process last year, made a list with
freind Carly Parry of eight problems
they saw in the process, Heimbuch
and Parry spoke as a panel at the

beginning of Thursday night‘s fo-
rum.

Four of the problems were cor-
rected this year. including the repeal
ofa gag rule that allowed victims of
rape and sexual harrassment to speak
about the incident only with the col-
lege president, their RAs and SAS.
the mental health center or student
affairs, all of whom are sworrl to
confidentiality, Thegagrulehasbeen
lifted, but victims are still asked to be
responsible about whom they speak
with about the incident.

Two major suggestions that
Heimbuehsayswerenotimplemented
were for the three faculty members of
the Presidential Hearing Board to be
educated and trained in issues sur-
rounding rape and assault issues, and
for a list to be made of trained RA's,
faculty,staff and students who would
be willing to serve as advisers in the
hearing board process. Membets of
the hearing board, however, say that
they have alreadyrcceive/J some edu-
cation and training about the issue.

“At the beginning of the year, a
consultant was brought in to do a
workshop on sexual harrassment to
educate the people on the hearing
board. Whether this was done last
yearor notI don'lknow, but this was
an educational session that lasted more
thantwohours,"saidJanJackaowski,
Chair of the President‘s Hearing
Board. This is Jackowski’s first year
on the hearing board.

People with suggestions about
changes they would like to see made
in the hearing process or any other
part of Grinnell's policy on rape and
sexual harrassment are encouraged
to mail them to postofflce box 17-66.
