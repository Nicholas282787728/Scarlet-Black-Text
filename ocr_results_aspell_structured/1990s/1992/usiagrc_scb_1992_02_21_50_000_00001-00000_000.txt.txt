available, as well as regular coffee.

The building is well-ventilated, so
smoking will be allowed. There will
be two sound systems, ajukebox and
a stereo; also, musical and Black Box
performances can be given on a stage

ing library containing material not
available in Burltng may also be in-

While tltc budget still has to be
passed by Joint Board, the Finance
Committee has approved 53000 of
SGA money for the coffeehouse.
More funds will be needed however.
and because the building will be stu-
dent-run, SGA hopes to get addi-
tional funds through student dona-
tions. The coffeehouse will be run by

student groups. Last year's party was ' '

accompanied by an SGA resolution
declaring the week before the Harris
party “Disco week" in the middle of
Black History Month, causing a pro-
test by the Concerned Black Students
group.

“The only feedback we‘ve gotten
so far has been positive when we
went out and collected money,“ said
Jason Wagner, one of the party‘s or»
ganizers. “There was no ideological
problem with having a disco party.
The factlhatSGA letus declaredisco
week in the middle of Black History
Month - that was the problem.”

This year, the party's organizers
have gotten their budget passed by
SGA fordecorations, food and bevcr»
ages, as well as money to buy cucum-
bcrs for people to stuff down their
pants. The theme of the party is “the
men who stuff their crotches.”

The group also introduced a reso-
lution to SGA this year declaring the

graffitied walls were repainted. The
coffeehouse‘s freshly painted walls

will be free to be decorated by stu- ;
dents, with the possibility of being ‘

redecorated biweekly.

In order to make more space, the
bar will be made into a Urshape. The

Devorah Block described the up-
coming concert of Klezmer music as
“fun in aJewishemnic-traditional sort
of way." The concert, sponsored by
the Jewish student organization
Chalutzim, is one the activities
planned for the upcoming Jewish
Cultural Week.

According to Chalutzim head
Becky Lansky, one of the purposes of
Jewish Cultural Week is to “show
typical white Americans that other
people have contributed to history."
She added that the week should give
“a rough idea that the [Jewish] cul-
ture expands across many things."
Jason Kimelman said the Cultural
week would provide “a greater expo-
sure to Jewish culture."

Jewish Cultural Week is tradition-
ally held during the Purim festival,
Purim celebrates the survival of the
Jews in Persia due to a benevolent
Persian-Jewish queen. This year,
Purim falls on the week before spring
break. Chalutzim plans a play and
debate to celebrate the holiday.

Starting Wednesday February 26,

Chalutzim has sponsored a folksing-
ing concert at 9:00 pm, in Main
Lounge. The event will include two
