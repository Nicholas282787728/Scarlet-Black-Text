dangers it illuminated, Lhelean Burkle

S&B cuts budget

alotoftime to getoutthereartd hitall
of those advertisers, and it takes a
horrendous amount of time to mainr
tain files and keep some kind of or-
der. Butl seem to be getting name,
and I seem to be collecting the
money.“
Fletchersaidthatlastyear‘sbusi-
ness manager’s salary was far too
low considering the importance of
the position. “The business
manager's position is as imponantas
mine, and we can never forget that if
we are to truly rtln this paper like a
business. This year, we have rede-
ﬁned what an 5&8 business man
ager does, we have cut a couple of
extraneous position from our staff
roster and we have ensured that the
business manager is rewarded for his
hard work. it‘s a tough job and this
paper needs someone who will do it
well."
Askedifheconsideredanarticle
in his own paper about his staff’s
work a form of selfrpromotion,
Fletcher said, “I want the public to
know something about this opera-
tion. I want President Ferguson to
have some idea how media funding
operates. I want faculty members to
understandit,and,mostimportantly.
I want the students to be completely
aware of how their paper is funded,
what its goals are and how much of

their student activity fee money is
supponing it, and how much is not.
And I never again want to hear any-
one say that SGA funds us without
knowing in dollars what that level of
fundingisand howitcomparestoour
total budget.”

Fletcher and Sinclair-Day
pointed out that me less than $2000
of SGA money does not even cover
the staff salary budget. “Were we to
subtract the salary cost from our ex-
penses, theS&B would be making an
overall proﬁt this semester." Both
agree that, whileachieving an overall
profit for the paper would be an ad
mirableaccomplishment, the college
should be expected, whether it is
through SGA money or direct col-
lege budget money, to provide funds
for media position salaries.

“it is for the good of the school
that the media be maintained, and
providing respectable amount of
money for media salaries is 3 worth-
while invesurlent," Fletcher said. “I
sincerely want to establish some kind
of continuity from one semester to
the next on this paper. “ Fletcher‘s
goal is to instill a sense that media
head positions are earned and are
something worth working toward. “1
want my reporters, some of whom
are new students, to actually aspire to
ﬁll editorial positions when] and my
staff are gone."
