Suckow Remembered

by Kendra Ford

The celebratory events
started Wednesday night and contin-
ued well into the evening on Thurs-
day, This is the centennial Celebral
tion of the binhday ofRulh Suekow
(soo-coe), native Iowan and one time
Grinnell student. On Wednesday
evening members from the student
group Mouseion, read portions of
Sockow's novella, A Part of the In-
stitution, which is set here at GrinA
ncll, drawn from her experiences at
the college. It is a humorous piece
which still reﬂects the tones of life in
Grinnellr Pheobe Lostroh, Toni
Siragusa, and Laura Blackwell read
the selections from Suckow’s story.

But the majority of the
events occttred on Thursday. begin;
ning with the convocation, given by
award winning author, Curtis
Hamack. Hamack, a ‘49 Grinnell
graduate, commented on tlte authen-
ticity of Suckow’s “regional“ voice,
that the particulars of her lowa set-
ting are universal. Hamackdescribed

Suckow's family as being a blend of’

the“high"andthe“low”;hcrmother’s
family had an intellectual bent while
herfuther’s familywasfromtheGerr
man working class. This blend, ac-
cording to Harnack, is good for an
artist,itlendstheeyefortheordtnary
with an extraordinary ability to ex-
press it. Harnack described, in some
detail, the many women and men
who inhabit Sockow’s works. The
women and men who struggle to live

with each other and with themselves,
who learn that change never brings
what is expected but italways brings
something but often at the cost of
everything else. Mr. Hamack then
retired to Grinnell House for a lun-
cheon with members of the faculty
and returned to New York Thursday
afternoon

in the afternoon there was a
panel discussion entitled, Why Cele
ebmte Ruth Suckow. Panelist were,
Leedice Kissane (mother of James
Kissane, English Dept), Suckow’s
biographer, Caroline Gebhard, assis-
tant professor of English, and Re-
becca Christian, author of the play
presented on Thursday evening, Just
S uppose: The S tary aflowa Novelist
RuthSuckow.Thepanelistseach pre~
sean a few comments on Suckow
and then took questions from the
audience. The audience was com-

prised largely of people who had
been alive when Suckow was alive
and popular. The discussion focused
on the merits of Suckow’s writing
and the imponance of reinstating
women writers into the “canon“ of
classic works.
The consensus among the panelist
was that Suckow’s short stories are
of more consistent quality than her
novels and they recommend The
Omnibus of Ruth Suckow's short
stories and her novel, The Fol/tr.

students. 1 give him my blessings
and highest recommendation to share
this music with audiences every-
where. Iam sure that he will please
