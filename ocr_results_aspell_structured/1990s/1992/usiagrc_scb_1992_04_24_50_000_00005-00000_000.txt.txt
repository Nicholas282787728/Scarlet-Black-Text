Everyone talks about sex,
but not about pregnancy

By Ann Treistman

“III had come here and told every-
onetltat I was alesbian," said Daurice
Coaster, hoisting her son Isiah on to
her lap, “everyone here would have
said ‘How great, how wonderful, we
have this support group and that hot
line.’You tellsomepeoplethatyou’re
pregnant, and their ﬁrst thought is,
'Oh you messed up.‘ They say,
'Daurice, you’re so smart, how could
you have let this happen?”

Coaster was emphatic in stating

. that intelligence has nothing to do
with getting pregnant. She pointed
out that sexual intercourse goes on all
the time at ortnnell College. “Every-
oneagrees that sex is great," she said,
"but then there are the consequences
and everyone is quiet.”

Student Affairs was very quiet
when Dauricc approached them. She
felt frustrated that the office makes
availableinformation on dealing with
a person‘s sexual identity, on rela—
tionships, on suicide, on drugs...but
when shetold them thatshcwaspregr
nant and asked aboutaffordable hous-
ing or ways to re-finance her educa—
tion, she said that no one could help
her.

“We have no support system here.
StudentAffairs can easily look in the
phone book and ﬁgure out where to
getinformation, but they had no idea.
I guess itjust never hits people... 0
one wants to talk about pregnancy.
Pregnancy is a reality."

Being pregnant on any college
> campus is not easy, but Gnnnell
proved to be especially difficult. She
brought a proposal to the President’s
- Committee on Multiculturalism aske

ing that the campus address the needs

of parents who are students. Coaster
emphasized mat the term Multi-
culturalism shouldencompass all sorts
of people, including those who are
parents. She would like to see more
education given to R.A.‘s and S.A.’s
on theemotionalandphysical changes
which pregnant women go through.
“It was so pitiful," she said. “People
just didn't know what to say to me."

According to Coaster, the tradi»
tional student, one who goes back to
the dorms, eats in the dining halls and
can work all night in the library, is
considered the ideal student A non-
traditional student is not generally
seenaspositive. Noris theimage ofa
single mother.

“Ihatebeing called asingle parent
because it has so many negative con»
notations. What does your marital
status have to do with anything?“

For spiritual and personal reasons,
Coaster felt that abortion was not an
option. "My mother hadmewhen she
was thirteen," she revealed, pausing
to put one year old Isiah on the care
peted floor of her apartment, where
he tottered over to a plastic shopping
cart. ”I couldn‘t see myself making
that kind of choice [ an abortion}."

Coaster was quick to say that she
would support any woman who made
adifferentehoice.“ln the end itneeds
to be your decision,” she stated with-
out hesitation. Curtis DenBeste,
Isiah’s father, left it entirely up to
Coaster. She smiled when she admit-
ted, “He reallywanted the baby but he
said that I needed to make the decie
sion because it was my body.”

Coaster and DenBeste have made
the committrnent to raise their son
together and share in offering him
financial and emotional support.

being independent."

Being independent can be a large
responsibility. “I was scared [about
having a child] at first because of all
thestereolypes.. .ldidn’twanttohave
tojust scrape by. I wanted to be able
to give him [Isiah] things." Coaster
looked around the apartmenL In ad-
dition, she said, “Curtis' parents were
very concerned about Isiah being bir
racial. Very very concerned."
DenBeste is white.

She pulled Isiah back up into her
lap, running her fingers through his
curly hair, and explaining that she
and Curtis were also concerned. “Our
child was notgoing tobeone ofthese
color blind kids (who says) 'Oh, my
parents are different (from one an-
other) so I'll love everybody' because
thatisnotreallty. Heshouldbeproud
of both heritages, but its more im~
portant for us to teach him about
black heritage because he won‘tgetit
outside the home. He'll get racism
from all sides so he needs to be pre-
pared to deal with it,”

Isiah carefully lifted the earring
from his mother’s ear and solemnly
watched it dangle between his fin»
gers. “I don’t want to be the token
motheron campus,”Coastersaid,lak-
ing her earring back. “Pregnant
women call me all the time to talk.
It’s a heavy burden. There are so
many women who think they cannot
deal with it at Grinnell College. They
have abortions orleave. Pregnancy is
seen asmessing up." Daurice Coaster
proves that this attitude must change.

Lesbian couple discuss
anti-discrimination law

By Alison Wade

Anti-discrimination as it relates to
sexual orientation was the topic of a
lively discussion with Jean Love and
Pat Cain last Saturday in South
Lounge. Love and Cain, a lesbian
Couple hired under joint contract at
tthniversity of lowaSchoolof Law,
provided different angles of thought
on this highly relevant topic in their

discussion, “Anti-discrimination
Law: Race, Sex, and Sexual Orientae
lion."

According to Love, the topic of
lesbian, gay and bisexual rights are
particularly relevant in this state right
now, because the Iowa House rev
ccntly vetoed a bill that would extend
an anutdtcrimination law to include
sexual orientation. Atpresent, the act
protects people from discrimnation
on the basis of sex and race.

Love engaged the audience in a
lively discussion on what basis the
decision to not include sexual orienr
tation within this antidiscrimination
act was made. According to Love,
lesbians, gays and bisexuals differ
from the other groups protected by
the act because sexual onentation is
not immediately clear, as is usually

the case with one‘s race and sex.

Cain discussed a series of legal
case studies as a means to highlight
the biases which are present in the
laws of many states. She discussed at
length the “sodomy" law, which she
claims has indirectly had severe and
negative consequences for lesbians,
gays, and bisexuals. According to
Cain, the values ofprivacy andequal—
iry are most often vrolated by such
discriminatory laws.

The discussion was enlightening,
revealing the very stark inequalities
presentialbeit sometimes indi-
rectly—in our legal system. How-
ever. both Love and Cain seemed
optimistic about people‘s ability to
change the laws,if not theundcrlying
biases behind the laws.

Their talk was sponsored by the
Noun Program in Women‘s Studies.
