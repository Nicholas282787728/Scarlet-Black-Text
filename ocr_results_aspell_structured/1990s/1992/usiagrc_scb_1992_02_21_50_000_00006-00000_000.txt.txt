Freedom of addiction LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
A man alone in his hate

Grinnell has ﬁnally done it. We’ve gone the way of office buildings,
hospitals and government institutions that have banned smoking from their
midst. Butisthisenough? Should weasa studentbody really besatisﬁed with
one smoke-free dorm, or should we blaze new territory in true Grinnell
fashion and do something revolutionary, bold, and utterly ridiculous? Yes
friends, were talking about addiction ronly dorms, the trend of the 90's for
liberal arts colleges.

Now stop skippin gover to letters in response toMike Washbum and think
about this for a minute. We all know nonAsmokers haverights. They have the
right not to breathe cancer causing
air, the right to live their lives free of
sidestream smoke, and we of the Star-
let and Black are in full support of a
separate don-n that protects these
rights. But if we truely call ourselves
politically correct, if we truely be-
lieveinour beans that no group should
be persecuted because of their habits and addictions, then we must act now
to create smokevonly dorms and beer-only dorms and protect the rights of
substance abusing citizens everywhere.

Each dorm, of course, would need to have entry requirements that must
be fulliilled to maintain its true nonoppressive atmosphere. inhabitants of the
smoke-only dorm (we recommend Cleveland because of its traditional
support of smokers rights) would need a signed note from their doctor
verifying that they are in fact addicted to nicotine. In addition, each one
would have to provide two peer references, testifying that they have
personally seen the individual smoke at least a carton a week.

Ech of the bathrooms shall be equipped with Topot, the smoker‘s tooth
polish. Buildings and Grounds will be asked to install overnight cigarette
holders over the beds so thatresidents can sustain their habit while they sleep
,Also necessary are smoke alarms that sound when the level of toxins drops
below an acceptable level. In order to keep toxins high, and smoke as dense
as possible , all the windows must be welded shut from the outside.

That's well and good you say, but what about the other prevailing
addiction on campus-beer? Don't despair, beer swilling masses, Norrisshall

To the Editor,

As Jews at Grinnell we feel com-
pellcdtorcspondtoMichashbum's
article Leftist K rtrtaltrmcht has ar-
rived (Scarlcl and Black 2/14).

For those who are unaware. tlte
word Kristallnaeht means in German
“The Night of Broken Glass" and
refers to the night when HlLICfrinr
spired mobs stormed through Jewtsh
neighborhoods in Germany Vandale
izing homes and shops, beating
people, and burning all of the books
that could be found. The work was
long and bloody and went on through
the night;yellow Jewish stars,badges
of hale,were splattered red. The sound
of shattering glass could be heard
everywherepiercing the darkness.The
unfortunate Jews, men and women,
young and old alike, were beaten and
some were killed. The “fortunate"
Jewscould do nothing but listen from
their hiding spots to the sounds of the
evening's carnage and watch as their
homes and shops were burned. And
there were the books. Thousands of
books, many ancient and holy, were
burned in bonﬁres all over Germany
as a testament to all that Hitler’s New
Germany would stand for. All that the
Jews could do was watchand weepas
sacred words on sacred paged turned
to ash in wisps of flames. As was so
often true with Jews, the fate of their
books foreshadowed their own and
they too, in the end, would feel the
touch of flame and leave only wisps
of smoke.

We have read Mr. Washbum‘s

column and do notsee theconnection
with any of the phenomenon he re4
counts. Theonly parallel is that in our
minds” eye we can hear the mobs
shouting“Gcrmany fortthcrmans,”
and can nothelp butnotice thcecho in
Mr. Washbum’s apparent message
“America for the White Americans! "
Mr. Washbum uses words like water,
with no sense ofthetrwetghtand cost
or the pain they may cause, Perhaps
he is ignorant of their meaning and
effect. Perhaps not.

American Jews are extremely ape
preciritive of the blessings of liberty
that our nation has offered us. How-
ever, the latter half of the 20th ccnr
tury has left us somewhat suspicious.
We are very much aware ofthe limits
of liberty. As thecurtain rises on each
new act in the play of human history
we always feel compelled to look to
seeifanotherHitlerwaitsinthewings
and wonder who will be the next
target,

When we hear Mr. Washbum‘s
echoing of the words of David Duke.
even if his venom is directed for the
moment at Mexican Americans, the
hair on our colleetive necks go up.
We hear the same stupid and fright-
ening messages of the hate mongers,
and those who come behind them and
try to legitimize it. We hear Mr.
Washbum use theword“courageous"
to describe men such as Hitler and
Stalin and we can only wonder. We
say these things not only as Jews, but
as human beings ever aware that the
lesson of Nazi Germany can apply to

any group ofpcople at any Lime. Yes-

terday it was the Jews and who can

say at whom hate will be directed

tomorrow? Who does not matter.

What does matter is our commitment

not to tolerate itevcr again. We hear

Mr. Washbum playing the one-note

piano of dcmagoguery and racial in—

tolerance and we are required to rcr

spond. So to answer Mr, Washbum’s

claim thata leftist Kristallnacht has

arrived; we have seen no glass shat-

tered, no bonfire of books, and no

burning homes. In truth, all we see, is
a man alone with his hate.

America not for Whites only

To Mike Washbum: Week after
week, in the Scarlet and Black and
the Spectator, I have seen you make
poignant efforts to address the con-
cents of conservative citizens here in
Grinnell and across the United States
of America. Conservative viewpoints
deserve as much attention and con-
sideration as do liberal, or any other
viewpoints, yet i feel that you have
been making some fundamental er-
rors in your explanations of racism
andmulticulturalism in America.Face
it Mike, America is not for whites
only. It is a problem that Mexicans.
Cubans, Jamaicans, etc. escape ille-
gally from their homelands ’into
America, but you can not do justice to
the problem by opposing their exist-
ence as potential laborers here in the
UnitedStatesAmericaisstillover50
percent white, and (I reiterate from
previous letters I have sent to the
Spectator) its bastions of power are
still dominated by white males as
they have been since the Declaration
of Dependence was signed on that
fateful day in 1776. A resident of
Califomia,l am well aware that often
immigrants come in too fast for the
eceonomy to cope, and factions,
whether they come from the left or
the right, are often hasty to make
angry demands. However, this is

NOWHERE near the impact of a
Kristallrtachl. I’m sure you know ex-
actly what happened on that night at
the height of the Nuremberg laws’
enforcement. The powers that were
in Germany took it upon themselves
to personally destroy the property of
a minority religion they believed to
be dart gerous to their way of life and
their political system. Immigrants
today are seeking shelter under our
political system here in the USA, not
trying to destroy it. The status of
racism in America has changed little

since Lincoln signed the Emancipa-
tion Proclamation in 1865. All that
has happened is that the minority
population has become larger, der
manding attention . The American way
of life is not being destroyed as were
the homes and places of business of
theJews onKrt'rmllrtachl,theAmcri-
canwayoflifesimplyneedstochange
in order to accomodate these new
Americans and appease the ﬂood of
“leftist” demands being made.
Sincerely.

To the editor,

For three to six hours a day, four
days a week, studio artcourses meet
in Gardner Lounge. This was not a
collective decision of the students in
these courses, The Fine Arts building
is so poorly ventilated that it is danr
gerous to work there. Therefore, it is
a necessity that classes are held else-
where. Lasl semester when the prob»
lent arose, several locations were con
sidered, but Gardner Lounge, al-
though not ideal , offers the best alter—
native, The students in the classes are

adapting to the inconvenience this
poses, however,

some Main Hall residents still ﬁnd
the situation intolerable. After all,
Sallyjerrekaphacl is on at three, and
because classes are held until four,
one can understand their dismay. It
seems more upsetting, though, that
other students do not have the oppor-
tunity to take thcsc courses without
both the distraction ofa telcvision in
the classroom and the lessrthanV
