Arkansas native Dave Eslinger
‘95 said he was “delighted" to see the

ticularly common during election

Perhaps Political Science major
Jon Klein '93 put it best for all of us
when he said, “I'm glad it’s over. I
have plenty of work to do."

With the election over, we will
see George Bush get back to the busi-
ness of grandparenting, Elaine Baxter
and Jean-Lloyd Jones return to their
jobs in state govemment, and ERA
supporters plan their next move in
theirdrive forequality. Marty incum-
bents return for another term Many
other incumbents plan their new found
free time. And Grinnell students,
they can yetagain return to what they
do best—schoolwork.
