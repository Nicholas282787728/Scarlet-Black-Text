Knowledge: Fisher frustrated by missing info

THINKEFi’ S
CORNER

by Gareth Fisher

The majority of people at onnnell
College. whether they realize it or not
believe that knowledge is golden. Ifyou
don't it is net llkely that you will remain
here very long. The Grinnell College
average grade point average is not 3.14
because students like to go to class and be
done {or the day. and not the least bit
curious to open their book bags over the
weekend. Cenainly, part of the drive is
the necessity of getting good grades to
please Mom and Dad. or as future em-
ployer or grad school who may care. But
i doubt many would argue that for the
majority ofstudents on on campus who
often knowingly impose huge workloads
on themselves. those would be the sole or
even primary motivations. The drive for
knowledgeholds it own interest. Profes-
sors are an even greater exampleofthis. It
is difﬁcult to spend several years of your
life committed to virntally one subject
virtually all of the time. without having
some inherent interest in finding outmore
about it.

For anyone so obsessive. Grinnell is
very often a happy home. Since most of
us are nearly always busy. we are confi-
dent in the belief tltat we can‘t spend any
more time Lhan we already are diving inlo
a Vast pool of knowledge out Lhere, Even
ifwe're searching in the wrong direction

every imaginable campus group is ready
to ply us with all sorts of information
about their concerns. lknow all sorts of
statistics about domestic violencebccasuc
they are up all over campus Lhis week. I
know more ab0u| about racial awareness
issues becasuc of the card controversy
last week. The examples go on. We feel
safe in the knowledge that if an issue is
important enough it will come up in our
pluralistic intellectual environment here
in the middle of Iowa. We may not
discover the truth to the universe. but we
arereasenablysatisfied thatatonetimeor
another. it has been offered to us as a
possible explanation.

That is why it is particularly harsh in
this environment when we start to lose
our sense of acccs to the “free market-
place of ideas." Lately two things have
happened which cause us to doubt that
certain knowledge, albeit importam
knowledge, is accessible to us. Fll’SL and
perhaps foremost. the growing concern
about the amountofassaull an liarrassmenl
going on at this campus vs. the antounr
that is reported to us. And. second. the
recentﬁring ofFrenchlanguage assistant
ano Sanchez.

It has becomepainrully obvious tltat
if I wish to obtain important information
about harrassment and assault on this
campus. Student Affairs is netgoing to be
able to provide all of Lhe information that
I'm asking for. The pamphlet on campus

INTERNATIONAL

PERSPECTIVE

by Papa Dwusu

SomeLime last year. the editorof
the Dartmouth Review at Dartmouth
College was alleged to have quoted
Hitler in his editorial piece. This, of
course. constituted an insult to Jews
in particular. and to any sound mind
who knows about the monstrous
Adolf Hitler. The editor took a lot of
heat for his unwarranted quotation. l
fact, he eventually resigned his post.
But in Grinnell College. a racist
clothed in a conservative jersey. has
launched a vituperaLive war of words
on Blacks, and the campus is silent.
He has even been lauded by the flam-
boyant editor of this newspuper as
being skillful in presenting his argu-
menLS. Would you praise Hitler for
skill and bravery in being able to
massacre millions of people? How
can Grinnell College. the celebrated
bastion of liberalism. be so silent
aboutsuch flagrantinsullsto Blacks?

How ironic i s for a guy who calls
his column "Common Sense" to consis-
tently show plain ignorance and serious
lack of common sense in his column. His
halesinspirEd writings about Blacks are
full of lies and distortions in immeasurr
able degree: I wonder how on earth any-
one would call his argumens coherent.
Forthcmostpan.hclies.exaggeratesand
overrgeneralizes isolated incidents to
make his case. This is not an unfamiliar
tactic: it is very typical ofracist dema
gogues,

First, Washburn makes no secret of
his disdain for African leadership, :1»
ways making allusiOns to turbulent rer
gimes of despots like Idi Amin and
Bokassa. But Mike‘s arglmient is flawed
in Lhe sense that he tries to define African
leadership in terms of our most desin

dents of French House didn't like him or
he committed some gross and illegal of-
fense we have not yet heard about or the
administration dismissed him as part of a
witch hunt to dispose of anyone without
Ll'ial whose names are asssociated with
sexual harassment to save their reputas
lion Added to all this is Sanchcz's own
assertion that he was not offered an op.
porluniiy to defend himself

Ultimately. the iltlpediment to our
knowledge in either of these cases has
acused a grout deal of uncertainty about
What we don't know. The college com»
munity is much more incltncd to believe
other things are goingon bcitind our backs
because we couldn't ﬁnd the answers to
drese questions. Like a love who is once
Jilted, it becomes difﬁcult for thecomnlllr
nity to tmst the administration after in
stances such as these.

Is there a solution to all this? Things
could definitely be improved It has been
demonstrated over the lasts everal months
that student input can have an affect on
what is revealed about assault and
ltarrassmcnt cases on this campus. Even
the student priv acy act has become some

cableloadcrs, Youdon'tuse Hillcr, Stalin
or Ceauscescu to define European leader»

Second. Washbum shows his cone
tempt for Africans by his perstslenlrcl‘er-
enee to Africa as a continent of starving
nations. There are 53 nations in Africa.
The handhtl that experience occasional
famine, mainly Angela. Mozambique.
Sudan. Somalia and Ethiopiaa are war-
lom countries whose eLhnicrivalries were
fanned largely by the cold war. But a
racist belief in white superiority causes
Washbum to state that lhemisery in these
counlrics resulted from Africans driving
oui European colonialtsls. You don'l
need to be an expert to understand the
extensive damage of European colonial
ism I0 Africans. Does Washbum know
what would be happening tehis European
kin tn Yugoslavia—engaged in tire fierc-
est ethinci fightmg in living memory—
without the massive international assiss
tanoe that they arereceiving? Theywould
be starving, Manrmadc misfortunes like
wars and famine should be deplored and
campaigned against. rather than siezcd as

tools efcynictsm and mockery of a race. _

Third. Washburn's portrayal of Afr
ricanrAmericans as Lhc epitome of all
that's wrong with America is sheer racist
nonsense. He would have us all believe
that Black crimes art: undeneportcd in an
America where Willie Horton can be a
tool for election victory. Iftherc is any-
thing to despise. it should be America's
racisrpast notAfricanrAmericans. Why
do you thrnkaslateas 1968. Dr. King had
to leadmarchesto clamor forracialequals
ity’! Orwhy would MalcolrnXbecomcso
angry as to coin theslogan: “by all meabs
necessary." This was the era when a
Black student needed a police mcort just
to walk to the clmsroom on a while cam-
pus. Following the briefora ofcivil rights
laws, enacted mesdy by the pragmatic
President Johnson. African Americans
have made remarkable strides. Ebony

what fclxible and we now more details
about specific cases than we were al
lowed to before It also seems possiblcto
me to create some sort ofpamphlet about
campus assault that goes beyond docu-
menting offenses that meet the legal defi-
nition of crime. In the Sanchez case. a
solution is less easy to See However, if
any of the aforementioned speculation is
true. this goes beyond a personnel matter.

made a fair assessment ofthe bold steps
AfricanAmericans have taken. in spiteof
the enormous odds they have faced.

Fourth, Washbum relishes in pre
senLing African culture as barbaric and
savage. Clitoritorrny is notas widespread
a practice in Africa is Washbunt would
have us believe. There might be some
isolated cases of this deplorable practice
in Africa. but don‘t some whites engage
in similar outrageous practices? How
about whites who practice sexual inter-
courscwithdogs andoﬂierpets? Wouldn't
I be dumb to use that to suggest white
backwardncss or innate behavioral de-
feet?

Fifth. and thmostshocking orallhis
assertions. he argues ihatBlacks are infer

academic achievement could be a mea

people would have superior genes than
the less affluent. And even Mike would
be inferior to many Blacks with more
