By Chris Maag

Jerome Reide, the Midwest

Relations and Respect for Human and

disparities between civil rights laws
and contemporary race relations in
America. He focused on major news
items ranging from Rosa Park’s con-
frontation on at Montgomery city bus
to lastyear’s assaulton Rodney King,
demonstrating that the Civtl Rights

Act of 1964 has never been truly
ahered to. Reide attributed many of
the problems facing the current civil
rights movementas well as therest of
society to a love of violence.
“Whenever a society that has vio-
lence portrayed in every walk of life,
one that has so many movies being
made that worship violenccr Tar/ml
nalar One and Two, Die Hard One
and Two, Lethal Weapon One, Two'
and now maybe Three, it’s a definite
sign that something has gone wrong
with that society," Said Reide.
Reidc‘s speech was well received
by the college. “I really enjoyed him.
Usually speakers, especially with so
many degreesare very esoteric," said

Affairs. “I thought he did a goodjob
of actually speaking to students in
stead ofjust faculty."

Black Studies. Reide holds two mas-
