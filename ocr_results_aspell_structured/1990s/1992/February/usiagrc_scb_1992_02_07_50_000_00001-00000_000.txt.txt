advertising everything from transcen-
dental meditation to swim meets to
black box breaks. Perhaps certain tri-
angular ones have caught your eye,
reading, “YO! W.R.A.P. with usl."
No, it’s not a call for rhyming en
masse. buta new venture by Grinnell’s
RA‘s— Wednesday Resident Advi-
sor Programs, every Wednesday
night, 9 pm, in various hall lounges.

The idea for W.R.A.P. has been
developed by the college’s Resident
Advisors. Many of them believed that
there was a need for more RA—run
programming onanall-campus level.

“I felt thatlast semﬂter. we weren ’t
doing enough things for the entire
campus," said Janice Gerda, the RA
for Clark and Dibble. "We wanted to
give students aplace to sit and openly

talkaboutthe issuesmlso to make use
of the expertise of the RA's, and of
course, to have fun.“

Shortly before the beginning of
the Spring semester, the RAs came
together to organize a schedule of
both educational and recreational pro
grams. The group tried for relatively
“fresh" topics that hadn't been covA
ered extensively in other arenas.

The first W,R.A.P. session, last
Wednesday,lanuary291h,wasoneof
the more contemplative programs.
Called “Archie Bunker‘s Neighbor-
hood,” it was an exercise in role re-
versals and experiencing discrimina—
tion. Norris and Cowl“ RA Rina
Patrick coordinated the program.

The participants, between 30 and
40 students, were randomly splitinto
six groups: Caucasian, African-
American, Asian»American, Native-
American, Latino/Latina, and Gay/
Lesbian. Each group was allocated a
certain amount of money and was to

Fire code prompts changes
Fire marshal cites college for 1 50 Violations

By Chris Maag

A recent inspccr
tion by the Grinnell
fire marshall has
prompted Grinnell to
spend $650,000 dol»
lars over two years to
bring donnitoriesand
ofﬁce buildings up to
code. The inspection
gave the college 150
individual citations.

“These things
aren‘tbeing done be
cause of new changes
in the firecode,“ said
Waldo Walker, head
of buildings and
grounds.“lt‘sjustthat
we haven’t had an inspection since
1985, and the code always has small
changes being made to it.”

Most noticable to students has been

cated in Stairways next to doors.

doorways can have no more than 900
square inches of glass in them. The
added drywall will help seal offmore
smoke in case of a fire.

New doors will soon be installed

so glass panels are
going to be put in
when we are able to
get the hardware,"
said Walker.

The doors will
have panic bars
attatched which will
allow them to latch

ing is neededto pre-
vent doors from be-
ing forced open by

which would allow the flames to
spread. They can not be allowed to
lock in order to allow residents to
escape from the fire.

Fire exit doors will also be installed
at the ends of corridors. The doors

iffs (students), all Caucasian.

"People were really honest about
their feelings... it was great to see
things clicking between what people
were living and whatthey were learn-
ing," said Mary Beth Weaver, RA for
Loose and Read Halls.

After twenty minutes of this simu-
lation, it was quite obvious which
groups were being favored by those
in charge, and which groups were
being discriminated against. The fms-
nation in the room reached such a
level that the RAs decided to stop and
moveon to a disussion format, which
then lasted for two hours.

New Internet computer
system goes on-line

By Chris Maag

Be not satisﬁed with the measly
conﬁnes of this system they call
Bitnet, oh mere computing mortals.
Your little worn, beige terminal now
has access to govemmentdatabases.
4000othercomputernetworks,count-
less universitiesand S4 countrieswith
the addition of Internet, a super net-
work of computers spanning the
globe.

The college has spent 810.000 on
the hardware and software needed to
runlntemet,$3,000 forthehookup to
the network, and will pay $3,500 a
year to remain on the system. The
system was hooked up on Thursday.
Jan. 30

“We're talking about a serious in»
vestrnent here," said Bill Francis of
Computer Services. “It‘s basically a
really big, really fast Bimet." Bitrlet
is able to process 10,000 characters
per second. The link to Internet will
be capable of handling 56,000 char-
acters per second. Grinnell from the
lntemet system can handle 56,000
characters per second.

Students and faculty will now have
the ability to log on to other comput-
ers on other networks and use their
programs from here. Users can also
transfer ﬁles and programs from these
computers to Grinnell, can access the
Compuserve database, not to men-
tion all the new colleges and univer-
sities to which it is now possible to
send mail.

Internet is accessible on the VAX
by typing [lnetmenu]. It will give you
a partial list of lntemet’s functions.
For questionsaboutthe network, type
[Hotline/Intemet] once inside the
Internet system. Computer Services
will soon be printing a guide to using
the system which will be available in
the ofﬁce in Darby.

Internet recently received three
billion Federaldollars from the High-
Performance Computing Act, de-
signed to help the nation's universi-
ties and businesses become more ef-
ﬁcient and integrated. Alan Gore, the
spon/sorof the bill, said it would help
connect the country’s computers and
speed up the work of large networks
and increase their capability.
