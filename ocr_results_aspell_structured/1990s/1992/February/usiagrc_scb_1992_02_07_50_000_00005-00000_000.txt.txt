An interview with Wilson Fellow Michael White

Michael White, Political editor of
the British newspaper The Guardian
and visiting Woodrow Wilson Fel»
low,allowed tho followinginterview.
White is an expert on both American
and British politics, sewing as both a
Parliamentary and Washington cor-
respondent.

Craig Wacker: Do you see Lhe
relationship between Britain and the
United States changing as a result of
closer ties between Britain and Eu~
rope‘.7

MichaelWhite: Ithinkeconomi»
cally orincreasingly links to all ofth
European community will be in-
creased, more and more where trade
isconcemed.Andtherewillcertainly
be less trade with the British C0m~
monwcalth. But we still do have a lot
of trade with the US and more
importa ntly than that we have Lies of
language, tradition,sentiment, the so
called special relationship which has
existed in different forms since the
War of 1 812, I suppose. when we last
quarreled seriously. And at an inr
tense level during World War Two,
in the relationship between Roosevelt
and Churchill, which was personally
quite strong. We've had ups and
downs since. but as we saw, the rela-
tionship between Margaret Thatcher
and Ronald Reagan-rdissimilar
people in some ways, who hold simi
lar political views and could be per
ceived as genuinely fond of each
other. Although you should always
guard against imagining that leaders
dothings becausethey like each other.
leaders do things in pursuit of their
national interests, We have always
been a pretty loyal ally andlieutenanl
of the United States in the Cold War
era..

CW: The face of the United Statm
is changing. It’s not, let’s say, as
anglicized as before. Could that cre-
ateany kind of rift between theUnited
States and Britain?

White: It‘s fascinating. Almost
as long as I can remember, people
have been predicting a fundamental
shift of United States interest away
from the Atlantic. Away from Eu-
rope. Towards thc south to some

degree, but much more, of course,
towards the Pacific. And a number
of yourrecentpresidents havecome
from California. For example, both
Nixon and Reagan. George Bush is
aquasi-Texan,although he‘saneast
coale.A.S.P. as well. All of these
have been predicted as the sign of
the great shift of the United States
away from Europe and towards the
Pacific. Butithasn’thappenedquile
as convincingly as we’ve been told,
Colin Wem was recently telling me
that most of the imponant develop—
ments in the world have taken place
either in California or the west coast
or Japan. Pretty well between l‘o-
kyo and the megalopolis equivalent
of LheWashington-Boston circuit in
the US and in California. No
denying it’s very importantand getr
ting more important. But the shift
that has been predicted for so long
hasn't actually happened yet. And

CW: Yes, it’s a bit ofan oddity

White: And it is an oddity that
such a small community and such an
ambitious campus exists out here in,
dare I say. the middle of nowhere.
And I haven’t gotten used to that at
all.
