IN THIS ISSUE

By Chris Maag

President Pamela Feruguson ap-
peared before the House Science,
Space and Technology Committee,
Science Subcommittee on March 31.
The Subcommittee was hearing state-
merits from a number of college and
university presidents about the qual-
ity of undergraduate seince education
as it begins to look into proposals for
the 1993 budget of the National Sci-
ence Foundation.

“I tried to convince them not that
they need to give us more money, but
that the money they are giving should
be distributed differently to put more
emphasis on science education,” said
Ferguson.

The National Science Foundation ’5
1992 budget was almost $3 billion,
only $30 million of which is going
towards education development. Durr
ing the ealy 19805, the Foundation’s
spending on education decreased to
close to zero. The subcommittee is

looking for suggestions ofwhatCon-
gress could do to raise the value and
emphasis of science teaching at
America's undergraduate institutions.

President Ferguson spoke both
from her experience at her current
position at Grinnelland from her more
than twenty years at Miami Univer-
sity in Florida. She said a largepartof
the problem with undergraduate sci
ence education at many universities
is that their reward system for profes»
sors is almost entirely based on re-
search and not on teaching.

“Nationwide, many institutions
havelosttheir sense of mission,” said
Ferguson. “Places like MIT and
Stanford are wonderful research tn-
stitutions, and that's what they're de-
signed to do. However, there are
hordes of universities who try and
behave like MIT and Stanford and
ignore undergraduate teaching in or-
der to stress research To change that.
you really need to change your ex-
pectations."

Ferguson was chosen to represent
undergraduate colleges and universir
ties because 30 percentof Grinnell’s
graduating class each year receive
degrees in science, almost twice the
national average, and eighty percent
of those go on to receive PhDs in
science. Grinnell was alsochosen be»
cause of President Ferguson's back-
ground in mathmatics.

She spoke on behalf of the Associ-
ated Colleges of the Midwest, of
which Grinnell is a member, as well
as the GreatLakes Colleges Associa-
tion and the Central Pennsylvania
Consortium,

The panel of witnesses included
Charles Vest. president of MIT: E.
Fred Carlisle, the provost of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and Karl Pister.
interim chancellor of the University
ofCalifomia,SantaCruz. Each ofthe
witnesses spoke to the subcommittee
for five minutes that sumarized a
longer written statement that was sub-
mitted to the committee.
