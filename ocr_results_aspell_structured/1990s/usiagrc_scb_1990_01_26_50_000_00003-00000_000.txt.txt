HOUSING. Students feel Crunch

going abroad were given ahousing-
preferencefonntofllloutandrctum
to the school by May 10, 1989, A
note was'included on that form:
“Receipt of tltis form in the Student
Affairs Ofﬁce will determine your
priority for spring housing within
your class." Later. in tlte Fall, a
veriﬁcation form was sent to each
student with the same note. Krohn
said that with the “high real estate"
(the much-desired singles) gone,
timing became cruciali Upon
receipt. each application was
marked to the exact minute. Class
seniority allowed for the 31 seniors
who requested singles to be
indulged. leaving only seven singles
for juniors. Dissatisfaction resulted,
though, due to thelocation ofthe38
singles; 25 were on north. campus,
while only 13 were on south.
Senior Francis Crofts, who
received a sinlge because of her
seniority, was assigned to Non-is
despite her request to live south.
However, since her room it is one

of the largersingles in Norris, Crofts
is notcomplaining. “Actually, I’m
glad to be where I am now," she
said.

When there were no more singles
left, students had to be housed in
doubles, and all Housing could do
was try to fulﬁll students’ requests
for either north or south campus.
When spaces to accommodate those
requests ran out, Housing looked at
where each student didn’t want to
live, and “tried to house students
away from those,“ Krohnsaid. "We
came to a point where we still had
some students left over, and we just
had to place them," she added.

Many students weren’t as
fortunate as Crofts. Junior Justine
Uselding, who was abroad on the
Grinnell-in-London program, said
that students in London “heard

« vague rumors about there being a
housing crunch Butwedidrt’treally
believe them at first. I mean, you
heara lot of rumors over there, and
we weren’t too inclined to believe

that rumor because we knew that
sophomores were living in
singles.”

Uselding had speciﬁed her
preference for a single on south
campus with full board. When she
didn’t hear anything back from
Housing by early January, Housing
informed her that the 86 students
who put in their requests for the 38
available singles were just being
placed that morning and aftemooni

_ that she had been placed in an off-

campus, college-owned co-op
house, with a roommate,

“I guess mine was not such a
horrorstory. l’veheardstoriesabout
seniors being stuck in doubles with
chain-smoking freshmen, so lguess
minewasn‘tsobad,” said Useldingi
“Jennifer Krohn was very
accomodating,butilwasjustahuge
hassle. The werstthing about itwas
thatI felt so in the dark about where
l was going to live right up until the
very end,“ she said

Cowles Terminals

Finally Completed

The construction of an
additional terminal room in
Cowlcs Hall, begun during
Thanksgiving break, will be
completed and ready for use
early next week, said Bill
Francis, director of Grinnell
Computer Services (GCS).

Students who had anticipated
the, completion of the terminal
room prior to first semester’s
finals week voiced numerous
complaints about the delay,

“I couldn’t ﬁnd an empty
terminal anywhere! And it was
so frustrating to stand in the
dinner line and just look at that
empty room,” said an
anonymous Norris resident.

Sophomore Sean O’Brien
said that, although the room had
been virtually untouched since
Thanksgiving, “They started up
construction again—drilling
holes and hammeringwn the
morning of my first exam,
which was right next door in the
lounge!“

Dart Tindall, director of the
Physical Plant, countered the
complaints by saying that

opening the room for use by
next Week was “not bad
[progress] at all,” considering
thttt construction on the room
was only begun at
Thanksgiving.

“We created a room from
scratch with very specific
mechanical needs, and very
speciﬁc requirements. I think,
we’ve got a fine room,” he said.

The installation of the
room's power lines is expected
to be completed by Monday.

Francis Said that GCS had
hoped to have the terminal room
ready for use by the time
students returned from winter
break. “Much work has been
done on the room since Jan. 2,”
he said.

Tindall explained the ﬁrst
delay as a lack of manpower. “I
only have four carpenters, and
their primary responsibility is
maintenance. If we’re working
on construction. and someone‘s
heater goes out, or a window
needs to be fixed, that’s where
our priorities lic."

Despite her involvement at
Grinncll. Janik believes she was
chosen because of her novel
proposal, which combines the
study of philosophy and
mathematics to show that
mathematics is a societal

» product that is perceived
differently in each culture.
Janik stressed the “aesthetic
experience“ of mathematics in
her proposal for future study.
The Marshall Scholarship will
enable her to writ her M.Phil by
attending classes at Sussex
University during her ﬁrst year
and doing research thc second
year .

The individualized attention
that is provided at Grinnell was
the key to the development of
her proposal. Janik said “I am
especially appreciative of
professors Davc Magnus and
Royce Wolf for all their

encouragement and optimism.”

Following Janik’s award.
David White was named as one
of the nation's 32 Rhodes
Scholars. This highly
prestigious award is based on
“some definite quality of
distinction, whether in intellect
or character.” Each slate has a
Committee of Selection which
nominates two candidates to
appear before the District
Committee. There are eight
districts of six states

All RhodesScholars attend
Oxford University in England
for two or three years and
receive sufﬁcient funds to cover
the costs of necessary expenses

White is a political science
major who held a leadership
position in the Concerned Black
Students group, and has
volunteered at the Human Gay
Resource Center and at the
Grinnell pre—school. White also

participated in varsity football.
According to White, the
Rhodes Scholarship opens doors
for him and provides easier
access to positions which would
have taken longer to obtain.
“This award will place me in
a position to execute my ideas
and hopefully work towards
making changes in society.

Professors Don Smith, Al

Jones. and Jan Czcchowski
hclped me win this award with
their advice on interviews and
letters.”

White plans to pursue a
bachelors degree in a joint
philosophy, politics, and
economics program.

President George Drake
commended the recipients on
earning the opportunity to
further their education in
excellent academic institutions
“This is a remarkable period for
Grinneil College. There has

and a Rhodes Scholar it
year. Mr. White and
Janik certainly had outstan
competition, which reflects
caliber of individuals we ii
here at Grinnell." said Drakr
1956 Rhodes Scholar. '
