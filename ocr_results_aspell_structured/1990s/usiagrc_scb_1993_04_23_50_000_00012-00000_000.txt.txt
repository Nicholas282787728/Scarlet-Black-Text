Why Bother? ;

by Doug Cutclu'ns ’93

AM SICK of unilttlt‘rttl decir
sioirs.

Asti tourguidc, [ haveolten
told prospectivcs how much the [tier
ulty and administration at Grinnell
listen to the students; how much they
care about our input, about how our
opinions are listened to and acted
upon. I usually pointed out the
“amoeba tables” on Bitrling first as
an example of how, historically, slUr
dents at Grinnell have had a say in
mostall areas ofcollegc life, even, in
thi case, in the renovation of the
library five years ago.

I’m not going to point this out
anymore.

Twice now this year. theadminis-
tration ofthiscollcgehasgoneovcrthc
students’ heads, making decisions
which affect as deeply without barely
consulting us. The first time it hap-
pened was when Dean Crady made the
decision tomakefive of the ten OCCO
houses into language houses without
consulting the Housing Committee.

Like many others at the time, I
signed the petitions, voted in SGA to
condemn this action, and talked to
the Trustees aboutiL “We may notbe
able to stop them this time,” we told
ourselves, “But at least it won’t hap-
pen again."

How naive we were.

Now, the Executive Council
(which contains no students), has der
cided to forgo the policy which the
Deansandlanguageprofessoisagreed
to,andtoprovidespaceforFrenchand
Chinese houses, even though a) they
didn’t have theirfonnscompleted and
b) there were other project houses to
take their place. Their reasoning? Stu-
dents supposedly “pressured” other
students to not live in the language
houses. Their source? The faculty,

What an insult.

in my four years here. nevcr ortce
have I heard Ufa student who made a
housing decision based on other
student's pressure. The very idea goes
againsttheconceptofself-govemance
which forms the foundation of student
residential life at Grinnell, To insinur
ate that the houses didn’t work be-
cause students were pressured into not
living there is to say that Gi-innell

others think they should do.

“C’monman...onlyGEEKS live
in language houses! What, your
MOMMY wants you to live there?
None of the COOL people live in
languagchouses."lsthisthevoiceof
a Grinnell student?

InfactneitherPresidentFerguson
nor the Executive Council talked with
students before making this decision.
Instead, they wenton the hearsay evi-

dcncc that the faculty had provided
them Wouldn‘t it perhaps hlii c been
smart to talk to the students who felt
dint drey were “pi cssrircd,“ or even to
the students who supposedly put Hus
pressure on others? In this why. we
Couldallcasthzldsomcidetthowmany
students were involved, and to what
extent they were “pressured.”

Of course. once you set a preco-
dcnt that you don’t have to consult
with students before making housing
policy, why bother going to them
again?

Artothcrthought.Ithasbecn id
by students, faculty, and adinrni
tion sin the beginning of this battle
that if the students don’t want the
language houses, they won’t Slgn up
for them, and they will fail, as they
did. Even if students WERE pres-
sured into not signing up for lan-
guage houses, this would be a clear
indication that many of the students
here do not want these houses, and
thus they should not exist.

So if the students do not want
these houses, as it is clear they do not,
why are they going to be here? Be
cause the language faculty and admin-
istration want them. This way, they
can tell prospective students. “..,and

Wouldn’t it be nice ifthey cared
as much about actual students' opin-
ions as they do about prospective
students‘ opinions?

Ijust hope that we also tell pro-
spective students that when the face
ulty and administration want some»
thing done, the students should just
shut up. because they won‘t be [is
tened to, and they’re just wasting
their breath and time.

How long until graduation?

We appreciate the manner in which you brought this to ourcollcctiic attention: in a constructive rind not destructive

organizuuon, but to your culture in general; birt, fortunately for till. you helped u o realize the rmplicutionswithout

though we cannot fully comprehend your emotions, we do sympathize With your position.

Upon hearing your statement and rccvaluaLing the inessageofthc flier. we understand where our intentions
may have been misconstrued by the general public, and we sincerely apologitc for any negative implications
we may have caused for your community. We apologize not forour beliefs, nor for the New Testament (for that
is the basis ofour belief), nor our Constitutional right to the freedom of speech, but that we left rootii In the flier
for a misrepresentation of the Jewish Community. It was a misunderstanding of the context, and not our
deliberate intent to portray all people oflewish faith to be Jesus' murderers. We assumed that the context was
clear and began to quote Christian Scriptures, not being as careful as we should have been. Our intent was in
no way to bring injury to your community. but only to inform the general public of the basic Gospel message,
However, our method may have lacked some sensitivrty to your position.

We hope that this incident allows our groups to work more cooperatively in the future and that through
cooperative teaching withinthetwo organizations, that we areable to bebetterinfonnedofeach othcr’sposition

Organization, firmly do not hold any anti-Semitic feelings. and in no way do we approve of speading that
sentiment toanyone. Jesus, ourSavior,clearly taughtus to loveall humankind. and werealize thatJesus himself

Finally, we would like to apologize for not immediately responding to your statement, and the roughness
of this letter. In our attempt to respond as quickly as we could, this letter may be less polished than we would
have liked. After greater deliberation on our part. we hope to follow up this letter with statements on the stalls
which the ﬂiers were posted, and, barring any objections from your group, the 5&8. In sum, we hope that you
accept our sincerest apologies and that in the future, we are able to avoid any further negative encounters. and
that a new environment can be fostered between Chalutztm and Christian Fellowship. Respectfully,

To the Editor:

Last Wednesday’s decision by President
Ferguson to distribute OffrCnn-ipus College
Owned Houses ina manner notreilecting demon-
strated levels of student commitment (to, givrng
preference to some language house groups even
though they weren’tfilled on time)notonly shows
that the regulation to the contrary announced by
DeanCradyearlierin Iheyeareffecttvelyamounted
to nothing, but also that the College is being
administratedwithhighcrprioritygivcntoaclliev-
ing a prestigious image (reportedly associated
with the presence of language houses) titan to
maintaining a highrquality educational environ-
ment on campus.

lam nothappy to be governed in thismnnner.
The College would do better to make good on its
claim to seek studentpolicyinputthan to continue
on in its apparent attempt to quietly erect other
claims which require the neglect of the first.

Real education Will not come from teaching
us thatouropinions don‘t matter, no matter which
prospective professors’ or students' eyes light up
when they see the phrase “Permanent Language
Houses."

1 consider the regulation requiring that pro
spectivc language houses be filled up with inter-
ested speakers by the satire date by which other,
student-initiated houses had to be filled to have
been an important one.
Tthollegc’sresources
really ought to be put to
the best educational use
possible.

In this case, Com-
milnity Service House,
Harlem House, and
Women’ 3 House all may
have created important, dynamic environments ai
Grinnell, but were denied places. It cannot be
certain thatany ofthoseenvironinents would have
been any greater than those to exist in next year‘s
language houses thatwerc not adequately filled on
time, but, since the mechanism that had been
designed to effectively make the decision was
(needed to be?) ignored, it seems possible that this
is the case,

The President’s stated reason for overriding
the regulation, to compensate for the reported
intimidation of prospective language house meme

Let’s have an end to exclusively prestige-

have some real communication here. before the
last minute, Student opinion is valuable, and can
be made more so if informed.
