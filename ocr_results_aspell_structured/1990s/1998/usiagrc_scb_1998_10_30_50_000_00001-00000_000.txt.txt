The Natural Law Party's popularity is
quickly spreading across the nation. Mere
months alter the third party began in [992,
Natural Law was on the ballot in 32 states.
I-Iundrcds responded from across the
political and socto-eCcnomtc spectrum,
lawyers, doctors, domestics, architects and
scientists, liberal, independent and conserva-
liv . In some California cities, the number
of Natural an supporters has surpassed the
number ofltepiiblictin supporters, Natural
law is springing up everywhere. And thanks
to Andy Civettiill’Ol and Rachel Nevas '02,
we have it on Campus.

That's because Civctlinl and Nevas started
Griltnell Students for Natural Law earlier
this year. Both have been involved with
Natural an pollthS before coming to
campus and both hope Grinncll students for
Natural Law will increase campus awareness
of their party, its methods and its candidates.
Rachel Nevas. ’02 first learned about the
Natural Law Party in l992 when both her
parents decided to run as NL candidates,
“When it ﬁrst started. it kind of bugged me,"
said Nevas. “I told my parents, ‘why are

you botheringi You're never going to win!"
As she got older, her attitude toward her
parents politics changes. “As i got older,I
began to admire their efforts, I liked how the
Natural Law Party Wasn’t bound the same
mles as Republicans and Democrats. Their
policies and the things they advocated forjust
made sense."

Rachel Nevas isn't alone in her admiration of
the Natural Law Party. In 1992, a small
independent political party came into being; its
platform was to use proven means to solve
problems in the country, According to party
co-founder and two time presidential candidate
Dr, John Hagclln “If a program works, and ifit
is cost effective, use it. And by the same
token, we should unsupport programs that do,
not work, are irrelevant, obsolete and/or are
not cost effective."

The Natural Law Party proposes many new
solutions for this countries problems. Many of
these suggestions completely reinterpret the
problems themselves, For example, in a
speech he gave before the Commonwealth
Club of California. Hagelin discussed the
Natural Law Party's views on the Health Care
debate.

“This country doesn’t have a health care
system,” said Hagelln, “it has a disease care
system, We must remove regulations that

inhibit preventive procedures, the stress put
on curing diseases after they manifest
themselves and the focus on the debate over
who pays for whose medical care,,,The
issues is about health The root of the health
care crisis is poor health; that's what we
should be trying to ﬁx."

The Natural Law Party supports efforts to
educate all citizens both to increase produc-
tivity and to eliminate Crime. “If thcrc is one
thing decades of ‘get tough on crime’
policies have taught us," said Hagelin at the
same event. “as that it doesn't work, We
have to improve education. because it is the
high school drop ours [that are far more
likely to get involved in crime then their
graduating peers]."

Thar platform attracted Civettmi, who
learned about the Natural Law Party while ,
he was in high school. “It was very sciena
tiflc; it was a good alternative to the two
party systemu really liked what they said,"
In general, the Natural Law Party’s platform
supports solutions that have been tested and
proven. rather than new, untried ideas. Many
of the party's ideas are derived from
scientiﬁc laws and practices. For more

on Saturday, Oct. 51, Grinncll will
holds [l‘td annual Halloween Costume
Party, Younkcr and smith Halls will host
~tlic party, which will run froln 10 p.m. to
1 am. The Halloween dance is one ofthe
most anticipated dances orthc year, alopg
with Waltz, Disco, and Mary B. James,
Nearly nil Students come in costumes,
Some choose very elaborate costumes,
while others make less ofan effort.
Marissa Payne ‘01, is the Hall Social
Coordinator for Younkcr and smith, and
is the main planncr for the Halloween
Party. ror thc dance, Payne is planning to
prcrenr awards for the best costumes as
well as other categories. Said Payne, “The
Halloween Party is always pretty big, A

lot of people go every year.”

A number ofstudenrs, all from Younkcr
Hall, are planning to act as DJ’S for the
party. Misty Huacuja, ‘99, and Hudson
Heatley ’01, are planning to D] as a duo.
The two played music at the last Harris
Party, the successful Coming Out Parry.
They also worked together on a few dances
last year. Said Huacuja, “Almost everyone
comes in costume. It’s sort ofa Grinnell tra»
dition, I guess wejusr like to play dress~up
” When asked ro recount her most memo-
table Halloween party experience, Huacuja
recounted an incident which occurred dur-
ing hersophomore year. A bunch ofpcople
came as smurfs, and they covered they’re
bodies with blue dyed Crisco. Everyone who
danced near them got smurfed too.

Costumes have long been a big drawing
point to the Halloween party. Payne and

of Jusrice, Guinier gained notoriety in
1995 when President Clinton, under pres
sure from conservatives, withdrew her
nomination for assistant attorney general
for civil rights.

Following her failed bid to head the
Jusrice Department's civil rights division,
Guinier forged ahead.

In recent years, she created Common-
place, a national nonprofit center to con—
nect citizens, communities and ideas. She
also helped develop Race Talks, a project
which strives to foster multiracial prob-
lcmsolving and collaboration.

In 1998 Guinier authored the book
Lift Every Voice: Turning a Civil Rights
Setback into a New Vision of Social Jus-
tice, which uses her nomination for assis-
tant attorney general as a window on the
issue ofcivil rights.

Guinicr accepted tenure at HLs in
January ofthis year.

plan to go as Charlie’s Angels. Huacuja, a
Texas native, intends to go dressed as a
country girl. When asked what was the
best Costumc from last year’s dance, Payne
and friend Meri Hellmcr, ’01, immedi-
ately picked the student who was dressed
as former Grinnell President Pam
Ferguson. “He had the walk down and ev-
erything,u said Payne.

In preparation for the party, many sru»

black balloons. South Pir held its own

As the process ofcclccting projects Fund
for Excellence approaches its ninth month,
administrators have bcgun gathering input
about the most recent, and final, batch of
proposals.

“1 have scheduled meetingswith trustees,
faculty, staff, students, rhc Executive Couna
cil, andwill probably meetwirh tiny non-col-
leg: pcoplc in the Community," wrote Presi-
dent Osgood in an c-mail.

Oncorthc fitsrsuch meetings is with stu-
dents. According to Paula Smith, Associate
Dean ofGrlnnell, an open meeting for stu-
dents will rake place rhisThursday in the Po-
rum South Lounge.

At the mccting, itrcndccs will discuss the
last batch of proposals. These proposals, dc-
signcd by individuals, groups, and depart»
menrsspanawidcrangcofpossibiliries. One
proposal requests money to create a toy li-
brary for children. Another seeks to recruit
and rcruin more students and faculty ofcolor,
still another would hire ii consultant to pro.
mote more environmental practices at the
college.

Each ofrhc 33 official proposals adheres
to a set of guidelines requiring descriptions
ortimc cumminmcnts, descriptions ofindi-
vidual and facility involvement. contextual
references, and evaluations orhow the pro-
posal might enhance rhc college.

A proposal’s potential to enhance the col-
lcgc, ofcoursc, lies at the heart ofthc discus»
sions. On its most basic level, da: Fund for
Excellence seeks to “solidify, promote, or im-
prove the colleges academic excellence and

reputation and, in turn, its ability to attract
talented faculty and students," said President
Osgood in an August 18 mm

For this reason, the relative cost: ofvarious
programs will have little bearing on their
dianccsofsclcction, According to smith, “Pro-
posals With the best chance ofsucccss are the
ones which promise to enhance the college in
a signiﬁcant way, whether they request a large
or a small sum [0 do so."

Added Osgood, “Size is not directly 2 fear
turc in deciding."

However, budget constraints and executive
concerns will limit the total number orproiccrs
chosen. Right now, the cost ofall the projects
together far exceeds the 5.7 million dollars in
the Fund, so some proposals must be elimi-
nated.

Ultimately, this decision—at least in terms
ofactual allocation falls to President Osgood.
Said Osgood, “The final decisions will be made
by me sitter consultation with [all members of
the Grinnell community] and some individual
discussions as well. However, my decision is
solely about the funds coming out. in some
cases faculty legislation or trustee action might
[also] be required."

Those who wish to participate in the cone
sultttiun process may e-mail
osgood@2dmin.grin.cdu. Additionally, stu.
dents who wish to attend the Forum meeting
should arrive in the South Lounge «7:30 pm.
on Thursday.

Complete copies oftlic proposals are in the
sccrcrariiil areas ofrhe academic buildings and
at the Office ofrhc President, as well as on re-
serve at Burling Library. A bricfdescription of
each proposal as well as further information

DiVCo, SGA hope to
improve campus
climate on diversity

BY MMussA THOMPSON
S raff Writer

The Diversity Coalition (Dlvco) and SGA
are working to put together a forum with the
goal crimproving the climate ofGrinnell re»
gsrding diversity issues.

“The relationship-building nature of this
forum really needs to be stressed," said Peter
Klaetsch, '99, SGA president. He and Erin
Marie Williams, Y00, student adviser to Divca,
explain that the forum is not a direct result of
the hate crimes on campus, but rnrhcr a result
of diversity issues that have been essentially
ongoing.

“The idea bchind it is that diversity and
multicultural groups often feel they dun'r have
a voice,” Williams says. in the past, adminis-
trators and trustees have asked students in these
groups about changing things but results
haven't necessarily been cvidcnt, Similarly, stuv
dcnrs alone cannot achieve all the changes they
may Want, The crucial issue is collecting ad—
ministrators and students together so that

changes can be effectively implemented and
recognized, Klaetsd‘l and warms explain.

“This forum will really stress the long
term,“ Williams explains. The goals are to in-
form SGA of the groups' issues and to have
SGA as their ally, “Then, when something
comes up,“ Williams elaborates, “it’ll be an
SGA issue as well sis t multicultural issue,”

Klactsch mentions how this constructive
dialogue between thc groups will make them
all allies rather than “differing factions" is they
may have felt up to this time.

“Divco brings more experience and connec-
tions to this forum," it: says. “Divco deserves
the credit for providing uic leadership and ot—
ganizariort structure for mu event. SGA fully
supports them and Wants to work within this
preexisting structure."

The goals ofrlic forum are to think, dis-
cuss and listen to issues that representatives of
the diversity and multicultural groups will
present to the cabinet of SGA, “Hopefully,
Grinnell will be i better place as a result,"
Klaetsch says.
