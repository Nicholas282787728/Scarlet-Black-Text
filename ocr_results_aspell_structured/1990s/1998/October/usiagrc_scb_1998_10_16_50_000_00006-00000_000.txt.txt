6Wake Up, Grinnell!

My morning walk rlrrough sourh Cam»

with hair standing on end, wearing rhe
clorhes mey put on rhree days ago and wirh
halrawake gazes offruslration, it is rhe week
before fall break, and soon rhe weariness will
be relieved wim full nights otsleep. The frus-
rrarion will disappear as one week can be
spent wirh no regard ro academics. As one
studenr put it, “I can leave rhe real world for
a week and go home."

i remember rhe excitement and coutu-
slon rhar came with going home lasr year for
rhe hrsr rirne. it was relieving.

So, as we near another break, rhere is
norhing I would urge our campus commu-
nity to 'do more rhan ro sir back, relax, watch
some mindless relevision and forget about
classes. The real world can wair for a week.
rur it on hold.

Wake up, crinnell. The world you enrer
when you leave dlis campus is real and it is
knocking at your doorstep. Take charge or

real society for a moment, bur you are only
tooling yourselves. lroo am guilty ofrhcatroc—

as i am here, receiving an cxccllcnt cducarion,
erar good is that education irrr shurs us orr
ro rlre real, cold hard rrurh orrlre wolltl?

The presitlenr orrhe United Suites ls be-
ing walked to the glnllonne as we walk to the
dininghalls. Partisan polirios have all burmade
our currenr governmenr a tool rot righting “the
other guy.” countless dollars are spcnr each
year by congressional Committees investigat-
ing Executive Departments and by Exccutivc
Committees lnvesrigarmg misdeeds by parti»
san Congresspersons. The Judicial Branch is
fair game for any partisan who wants to make
a wholeahearted attack, The checks and bad»
ances are not meanr for this kind orblatanr
partisanship. In dre end, rhls improper use or
power could send a President packing, or even
ro iail for a crime rhar he never should have
had to commit.

Where is the concern? You jesr, saying rhar
you do not care and ir does not arrecr you.
But ir does. Who are you? You are (or ar least
on yourway to being) rhe educated, the mori.
vated, rhe movers, the shakers. You are nor
rhe people who elecr politicians. Irrhe mass
orpeople did not vore like sheep herding to
wards the least nasty shepherd, lwouldn’t be

dency is reduced as a result orimpeachmenr,

at the will orrhe masses orsheep who respond
ro rhe racr ornegarive campaigns. but per-
haps i am oversraring my case, Still, Shouldn’t
you be concerned?

About what else should you be concerned?
The economyi surely, we as Grinnellians in
our uropia ofexistcncc do not have to worry
about the state orout economy. Asia and Latin
America’s economies are srumbling like
drunken pubgoers, yer we, as big-bad rule.
rhe-world Americans, should not worry. Wake
up! Time Magazine's cover caption last week
“The crash or ‘99?” What does rhar

was,

BY ANDREW CIV'ETTINI

mean? Whar would it mean ror you, the
student in utopia, irrhe world economy fails?

First, you mighr find ir hard to make
ends meer, and I imagine, rlre poorer among
us would begin ro leave school re and work
ro help support our families. The endows
tucnr would srorr ro ralrer. as deeply rooted
asitis in investment ﬁnances. Government
would cut back on some programs, more
rhan likely erasing your work study. Prices
would go up, work would become harder
ro ﬁnd, and you might fccl rhe pinch. In
rhe worsr case scenario, a serious worldwide
depression, people would starve, become ill,
and even die. lnsrirurions like rhis might be
forccd ro close. Where is rhe utopia in that?
Be afraid, be very afraid, The “Crash or‘99"
isn't as far from reality as you mighr rhink,

Finally, ler us rurn our arrention to rhe
recent evenrs on campus. i—lare crimes are
nothing to be taken lighrly, whether rhey
are homophobic, anti»Semitlc, racisr, or oth-
erwise in nature. suiclde is a somber, sol-
emn issue. My deepesr regrets go our to the
souls who are rouched by such rragedies. But
rhese incidents only rurrher prove my polnr.
We need ro wake up, Grinnell. We need re
search our hearts and intellecrs, evoking our
compassion, and strive to eradicate rhe ige
norance that hare crimes spring from, as well
as make sure rhar no soul on rhis Earth feels
the need to end his or her life. Where was
our concern for these rhings before they
came to us ar Grinnell? It was locked down
inside, that's where it was, for you, and for
me.

So, as you look out into your week away
from the rigors of academic life, turn on
CNN, read die newspaper, lisren to radio
talk shows: woke up. Delve deep inro your
souls and reignire the names orcompasslon
rhar drive us all to be human beings. (see
some practical educarion so rhat you can
apply your liberal education. oer back in
touch with teallry. Then when break has
ended we can all begin ro undertake the dif-
ﬁcult rask ordesrroying uropia, and under-
sranding crinnell in the light or the real
world. You have to break down a fantasy in
order to eonsrrucr a reality.

Have a great break,

Residen’r Redlisi:
+ What Would DeSimone D0 +

BY AMANDA DESIMONE

When i showed Sister Madeline a pic.
rure ormy Homecoming dare my freshman
year in high school, she rold me rhar God
prefers ugly people and that's why He made
so many or thcm, she wenr on to say rhar
nor only was my dare ugly, bur he looked
like a girl. Orhers may have been pur orrby
this uncourh remark. But really, I ﬁnd nuns
ro be a lor orrun 7 especially since they’re
no longer allowed ro bear you wirh rulers.
And so once again, i had to agree with Sise
rer Madeline for she was borh a nun and a
marriage counselor and rhererore very wise.
In racr, her divine and practical views on
relationships have helped shape my present
aerirude toward couples.

on occasion, i look to Hollywood tor
new insighrs abour couples because I’m rrom
LA where even rhe ren o'clock news is ac.
companied by an emotional musical score
and blockbuster explosions. For the past two
years, rhe Academy has awarded the Oscar
ro films abour couples — The Eng/ran nae
demand 77mm). Audiences. Critics around
rhe world adore rhese floods of sragnanr
pond warer which under rhe name ormoe
rion pictures have been vomired rorrh. These
movies are supposed to porrray loving
couples. Yet in rhe Englirn Patimttllc male
lead leaves his ladylove in a cave, l-lonesrly,
you just don't leave someone in a cave, cspc»
cially iryou claim to love the person. Even
Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing showed
more respecr for his woman when he said.
“No one puts baby in she Comer.” Qulre
frankly, [wouldn’t have minded ifsomeonc
pur Baby in a cave because she was a real
pain in rhe ass. As for Titanic, there was

plenty ofroom on that picce ofdrift wood for
rhe borh ofthcm. They seemed to manage {me
whsn they were romping around in the back
sear ofthat tiny buggy. I guess die point James
Cameron is trying to make here is that it’s okay
ro infringe upon your lover’s personal space
during sex, but not when the two of you are
dying orhypothermia.

Even in the rcal world, most couples l‘vc
met have offended m: in cvcry possiblc way.
However, I do appreciate those couples who
feel sorry for rheir single friends. You know,
the oncs who invite you on dates with thcm so
that you’ll fccl loved. This is ﬁne if you don’t
mind being the third wheel. On: friendly
couple went so far as to ask m: to accompany
them on a weckcnd getaway to sum: rustic
cabin in the mountains. I declined partly be»
cause i rhink they had more love planned than
1 could handle, but mainly because ir was a
free HBO wackcnd and I seriously doubted
that (hc cabin had ATV. At any rate, it’s nicc to
know that such pleasant couplcs cxist and ar:
willing to include you in thcir minus acts of
leisure.

The worst couplcs are thus: who pretend
they wam you to cxpcricnc: the same bliss
they’re expericncing. After all, the favoritc pas-
time of crazy people is sclling crazy to others.
So they try to set you up with the numerous
people they’ve rsjcclcd along the road to find-
ing one another. Thcy rcf=r to these castaway:
as “good friends". And how quickly thcy for
get the restraining orders and criminal charges
they ﬁled against their “good friends" just a few
mondrs earlier. Perhaps they think their rrash
will become your treasur: — it works for used-
clothing stores.

Despite all this, I'm still in supporr ofl-lu—
man companionship. I brought young men
home in high school. Unfortunately, Mr.
Dtsimonc lived in Lhc same house, as fathers
tend ro do. He would sir silenrly on the porch
within ﬁve feat of: shovel and a shotgun. Al»
though borh irems were made by Fisher Price,
rhey were metaphorically frightening enough
to scare everyone ofthosc boys out of the closet,
and they never called again. Soon tumors :1-
leging Mr. DeSimonr’s role as a soldier in die
West Coast Marla began ro circulate, which
didn’t help my social life cxccpt for that people
werea lot nicer to meatschool. And so lt goes.
