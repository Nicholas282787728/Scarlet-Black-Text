ith his hands

deftly bouncing across

the white keys of the

piano, Frank Conroy

created a gentle melody for all ofihc

people gathered in the South Lounge

of the Forum to hear. “Both music

and prose have rhythms, each of

which are perceived in time,” he

commented as he rose from the pi-

ano bench to read one of his short
works,

On Monday evening, Mr. Conroy
was present Ilere on the Grinnell
campus to not only read one of his
sltort works, but to also converse
wtth students and other people
present about writing
and literature in gene
eral.

Conroy, the direc-
tor ofthe prestigious
University of Iowa
Writer’s Workshop,
has written many

and the pure enjoyment ofit, and lit-
erary craftsmanship. He talked about
his love of reading and the classes
he teaches at the University orowa.
“I look for an intuition Within write
ers." he explained, “A drive, a push,
within them."

In Conroy‘s classes, he explained,
the students “are in close contact with
one another." They exchange work

"‘I look for an intuition within
writers. A drive, a push, within
them I am moved deeply by
writers who write”-Frank Conroy

perspective." as he explained.

Blaisc is the chair of the Univer
sity of Iowa's International Writing
Program, a program which seeks to
bring established writers wttli inter
national backgrounds to the United
States, so that they might experience
American culture. A graduate of the
writer's workshop, Blaise has taught
there. and will move on to teach at
Beikeley next year. While he is here,
he is asking his students to “put
themselves in the context of the
world,” to write with more of an in:
ternaticnal perspective.

Having lived in India. Europe,_and
Canada, Blaise is no stranger to the
international way of
life. He teaches in
Prague in the summer,
and has been to many
other places.

But he enjoys the
program here at
Grinnell, because it
gives him a chance to

 

Body & Soul and
Stop nine. Being a writer since “high
school,” he said, writing was some
thing that he had “always wanted to
do." Conroy believes that a truly
moving work is brought about by
“something haunting you; something
that won’t let you go." He said that
“idea is not a sufficiently powerful
engine to drive you through a work;
there has to be something else be
hind you."

Indeed, with eccentric hand
movements and powerful voice ll'lr
tonations, Mr. Conroy‘s reading was
full of energy and drama, as one
could feel tllc mood of the characr
lets contained within the story. Vi-
‘brant imagery, metaphors. and other
descriptive language could be heard
throughout the piece.

Mr, Conroy was present in a bit
more ofa relaxed situation, as he ate
lunch with some Grinnell students on
Monday afternoon: Conversation

west, as well as techniques officiion

and ideas, and he believes that this
provides a good environment for
people to develop as writers. “No one
knows what’s going to happen," In
stories, he explained. As he men-
tioned on Monday night, "you have
to get into it [wt iting], not knowing
the end or how you're going to get
there."

Asked on Monday evening about
his personal process of writing, Mr.
Conroy replied, “A writer needs to
have an established writing routine,
in which he or she merely sits and
composes for a few hours." Person»
ally, Conroy explained that he come
poses for “two to three hours daily."
The focus, he said, should be “to
make something new, not to edit or
revise," even if you “end up throw
ing it out."

Clark Blaise, who has Worked
with Conroy at the University of

Iowa, is here in Grinnell for three ,,

weeks, teaching amini-course on ﬁes
tion writing “with an international

currently not teaching, but 0 s

as the International Writing
Program's director. “I do a lot of
work for other people," he explained.

However, Blaise envistons more
of these three week mini-courses “I
think that the school wants to do
more of these," he explained,

Blaise, here for only a few short
weeks, hopes to develop the interna-
tional aspect of Griiinell authors‘

fully Mr. Conroy gave some young
Grinnell Writers insight into how he,
an cstahlishcd writer, writes, and it:-

to them.

Asked if he has a certain criteiia
for a work to be termed good, Conroy
replied, “Not really. If I’ m moved by
it, I pay attention." He coticludcd by
saying, “1 am moved deeply by writs

Squad prescribes Ritalin for all

BY KATHRYN NONAS
Staff Writer

The Ritalin Test Squad, Sounds
like something out of The Island of
DnMorezm, right? So what is the
Ritalin ‘fcst Squad? According to
Chad Hines ‘00, the founding memr
her and leader of the group, “the
Ritalin Test Squad is a group of ac—
tors and actresses that do improvisa-
tional scenes and games."

The troupe's propaganda lists the
new Ritalin Test Squad members as
Shana Barchas "01. Fred Beukema
“01 , Marisol Brito ”01. Molly
Gardner ”00, Chad Hines ”00,
Padraig Johnston “01. Robin
Kimball ”0]. Alissa Nashold ”00,
Brandon Olsen “0|, Jamal Rogers
“00, David Reed "98, Todd
Schanbneher “98. Jason Stohler "00
and Matt Warne "01.

Some of the performers joined the
group at its inception. “I was at the
first mcctiilg in the fall of 1996! In
fact, I was the first one at the first
meeting. I have been here for the
track," Schanbacher claimed, Veter-
ans of the Squad welcomed the new
members this year. Schanbacher said.
“The ﬁrst year class has some strong
people. We have a lot of first years
who have done improv in high
school, or are just really batlrass
funny." Stohler agreed, saying, “I am
really impressed with the first years.
We are a really young group and they
are doing a very goodjob of beating
our face."

Although Hines guides the Squad,
he chooses to not single himselfout
as the boss.

“I run the practices, do the warm
ups and decide what games we are
going to run for the show, It is pretty
democratic, though Ijust lend to be
the one who leads the troop in the
direction they need to go." claimed
Hines.

The crew has been active for ale
most two years, during which they
have performed at least eight times
in Various places on campus, includ-
ing two shows at the Arena Theater
and one show in the South Lounge

 

at the Forum. The rest of the Squad's
shows have been conducted In Bob's
Underground. “When we ﬁrst started
out, nobody knew who we were or
What the hell we were doing," Stohler
commented. Now the Squad has
gained some fans. Many students at
tended the Ritalin Test Squad‘s most
recent perfonnance. which was all
tcr Sibling Species in the Arena The
ater last semester.. In this show, they
altered and updated their perfor-
mance. “We have been introducing
new materials and new techniques
and changing our themes," come
merited Hines. A new approach to
suggestions trom the audience is be-
ing used by the Squad as well. “We
tried to run it like a complete show.
We didn‘t stop and get suggestions,
but we tried to work suggestion into
the game. Instead of getting sugges-
tions and then doing the skit, we now
get suggestions while we are per
forming," stated l-lines. “That‘way it
is more like a traditional play."
Each of these acts is based on an
improvisational technique created by
Dell Close called “the Herald, " in
which the actors \vork off of single
suggestions from an audience mem-
ber, “We construct around [the sug-
gestion] using interaction, characters,
themes with organic, SelfACOantlried
worlds," Hines said with arstraight
face tliatcould make anybody laugh.
But it isn't all fun and games. Not
only does the Squad practice iwtce a
week for one hour each night, but
their practice nights happen to fall
on Friday and Saturday. “I wish the
times could be different, bill it isjust
the ' crifice you make... It limits
you,.. Ifyou have nothing to do on
your Friday and Saturday night you
can just do improv indefinitely, Like
last year, we used to do rehearsals
on Saturday afternoons and we
would go for three hours." explained
Schanbacher. “Well, it is not the easy
going fun atmosphere that it used to
be, but if we want to establish our
selves as a definite part of the
Grinnell Theater Department, then
we need the extra work," Stohler re-

sponded. Practices begin with a fif-
teen minutc Warnirup period that
uses games to get the actors' minds
thinking. The next fortyrﬁve minutes
are dedicated to working on support-
ing each otherin improvisational acts
ing.

The members of the Ritalin Test
Squad work hard to ensure that there
is a future forimprovisational groups
on campus because they believe
improv is essential to a wellrrounded
Grinnell. “There Were some dark
days at Grinnell. For three years
improv died down...I was hoping that
[improv] would be my outlet and I
tried to find another outlet in choir,
in theater. in alcohol, but I never
found it,” joked Schanbncher, “If
Chad hadn't started it, I was going
to try and form my own little ini-
promptu group."

Everyonc wants to know the an-
swer to the question: where did they
get that name? “We were trying to
come up with a name. I wanted
something that would kind of give a
label to the comedy ferocities. I ale
ways make Ritalin references too It
just came to me," Schanbachcr
proudly said.

of the Trinity.

MF' Four semesters is an awfully
long time to keep a show with this
many Dis going. Is there a deep uni:

fying purpose behind the show .that‘

keeps it together? ,, ,,

AA, Well, women’s muSlC
doesn't get played a lot. We do play
a few men, but it's really just like
another radio show except that most
of them focus on men. We have a
lot of run finding women for the
show.

AE: I would say the main point
ofthe show is fun.

KV: Yeah, especially with the
Saturday time slot so that we don't
have to do anything afterward.

MF: So ifthat‘s all there is to it.
how do you explain the shocking
correlation between the songs played
on your sltow and the lyrics on the
walls of the Burling Bathroom?

RC: Aaargh.

xv: We categorically deity any
responsibility for the walls in
Burling.

AE: Wait. no, can I do a diatribe
here?

MF: Please.
AE: While we have nothing iii-

recrly to do with the walls, it would
be wrong for us to deny any kind of
responsibility. Our message, the
message ofthe Trinity, it's out there,
and we‘re disseminating It to the
masses, The walls in Burling show
how for our inﬂuence has spread.

KV: Idon'tthinktlici-e'stoo much
connection other than just writing
about strong women and playing
strong women on the show.

from the full leather outfits Melissa

Ant [Dilrnneo] runs around in.

MF: And Where does the Holy
Trinity fit in”

( The studio abruptly fills with
reverent silence.)

KV: That’s Ani Difranco, Melr
issa Ellieridge, and the Indigo Girls.

MF: Do they each have a differ-
ent role, like the Christian concept
oflhc Father, Son, and Holy Spirit?

RC: No, we don’t look at it that
way.

KV: They‘re all kind of up there
in their own way,

AE: But they‘re all similar in their
power,

AE: I won't dignify that with a

MF. Sorry. Iguess the Trinity is
more of ii polytheistic cosmology.
then. So ifwomen’s music was set
up like the Greek Pantheon...

AE: Ant, Melissa, and the indigo
Girls would be like three Zeuscs,

KV: No, three Heras.

AE: Yeah, that’s better.

AA: And the Trinity is deﬁnitely
at the center, but they sprang from
the Titans before them. Joan Baez,
Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin,
people like that.

AE: And there's lots of demie
