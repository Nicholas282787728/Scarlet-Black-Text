was bciow the moving cylinder. The
moving teeth or the concourse teeth
occasionally would get bent out of
line, andthetopofthewrench withthe
oblong hole was where the cylinder
teeth would ﬁt into and then they could
be bent back into line so the teeth
would not hit each other when the
cylinder turned, and the bottom ofthe

Now, ifthe stationary teeth and the
moving teeth were allowed to hit or
scrape each other, they would get hot
or, strikingeach other, they couldthrow
sparks,andnotvcryoftenbutthosehot
teeth or throwing sparks could set the
straw going through themachine aﬁre.

There, for all of us uninitiated, and
even forthe initiated, is amost graphic
description of what happens and the
ncccsSity for such a tool in the days of
theoriginalthreshingmachines,which
since have been replaced for the most
part by combines.

Not to be outdone by her husband‘s
erudity, Mrs. Benskin off-handedly
remarked that she herselfran a thresh-
ing machine for her father.

The Bcnskin's concave wrench,
which arrived in a bag with a pair of
gloves for Around to wcar while ex-
amining it, has found use since its
threshing machine days, as a tire tool
so is a bit compressed in one end but it
clearly is a duplicate of the original
thing,

The Des Moines Astronomical Society
will offer a free public viewingofthe night

Anyone with a home-telescope is wel~
come to bring it to the viewing, and mem-
bersofthe club willhelpparticipants set up
and adjust their telescopes for the viewing
ofobjects in the sky,

So the next Mystery Object is a
decided contmst to the previous one
submitted by Mr. Price and identiﬁed
by Mr. Benskin.

This one is l to l l/2inches, made of
metal and surrounded by tiny rings
appended to the central ring. It is his-
toric, indeed, dredged up from
someone‘s childhood and, it is to be
hoped,notinuseaiiymorcatall.Atrue

A knight in shining armor came by
Tuesday as the sign in front of the
Longhorn was being taken down after
37 years.

Who should this knight in shining
armor be but Mike McNally, now of
Atlanta, Ga, whose grandfather, fa-
ther and uncle were original propri-
etors ofMoNally‘sFoods,heretovisit
his mother Vcra McNally at Seeland
Park, who happened along just as the
signwasbeingremovedandjustasthe
Herald-Register photographer got
somethinginhereyeandwasunableto
make the shot.

So Mike, a Herald-Register pho-
tographerinhisyouth,gallantlyagreed
to make the shot before the historic
moment had passed. And it was his
toric in more ways than one in view of
McNally’s family's association with
the building in which the Longhorn
was located.
