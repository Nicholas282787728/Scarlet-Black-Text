Off With Their Heads!

Live music, subatomic physics, and “other blatantly
subversive actions” take center stage atAlice in Wonderland

By ANNlKA ENGINEER
Smfanser

Alice in wonderland, GrinneIl College’s annual explorarion osrhc psyche.
dellc and surreal, will be held ourside on sarrrrday, seprcmber 26 berween 1:00
ro 9:00 pm on Cenrrarl campus.

Alice, an annual fesrival held in honor oFLcwis Carroll’s famed heroine, is
inrended ro bring rhe enrire camprrs rogerher for a day osric.dying, live music,
bubble blowing, and “orher evenrs."

Says she'nomrious Nicholas Rains '00, who is organi-erng rhis year's evenr,
“Alice is an informal, cross—culrural, rnrcrdisciplinary symposium rhargives you
a chance ro ler your hair down and meer people you didn'r know before."

Nor only is Alice a chance ro cur loose and relax brrr, according ro Rains, ir
is also an educarional experience _ “Lass Alice, 1 spenr a whole lor of rlmc
srudying chemlsrry and subaromic physics and even a lirrle arr hisrory.“

The core rhcmes ofAlice seem so be survival, selfcxplormun, inrrospec.
rion, and mind expansion. These are loosely based on some ofrhe psychedelic
rhcmcs evrdenr in Cnrrail’s novel Alice in lander/amt,

Rains comments dial “it is a time whcn dissinztions are revealed for being
as blurry as rhey are, and you can make fascinaring discoveries rhar you didn’i
possibly drink you could make before,"

Enrorrainmenr for Alice rhis year will be provided by Thaddeus Brown, a
band from rhe Madison area rhar has previously performed ar Grinncll. says
Rains, “rhey‘re kind ofa jam baud rhar plays good my music."

T-shirrs lor Alice, designed by Shawn tlarrigan ‘99, Ben I’msiild ‘01, and
Rains, will be on sale oursidc rhc dining halls srar ring rhrs weekend.

The slirrrs will have fronr.baek represenrarions ofa collage of images in.
