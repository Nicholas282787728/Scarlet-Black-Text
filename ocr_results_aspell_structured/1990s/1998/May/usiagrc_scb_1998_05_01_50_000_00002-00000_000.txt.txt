Candidate for Grinnell College
President \ﬁsits Campus

The third in a series of candidates
for Grinnell President, Russell
Osgood, visited Grinnell College ear—
lier this week. Because of time con»
straints, Osgood was not able to ad«
dress students exclusively like the two
previous candidates to visit,

Osgood graduated magna cum
laude from Yale in 1969 with excep-
tional distinction in history. He served
in the US. Navy from 1969 to 1971,
returned to Yale in 1971, and received
a JD, degree from Yale in 1974.

Osgood entered private practice in
Boston, became associate professor of
law at Boston Universiry in 197s, and
joined the faculty of the Cornell Law
School in 1980. While at Cornell he
served as editor of die Law and His-

tory Review, and in 1988 he was
named dean of the law school.

He continues" to teach an under-
graduate polirical science course, Pro-
fessor Osgood’s scholarly work in-
cludes books and articles in the areas
of American legal history, employee
beneﬁts and pension law, and income
taxation. Under his leadership the law
school has introduced a writing pme
gram in its first year curriculum, de-
veloped an extensive international pme
gram, and increased the diversity of
its faculty

Ellen Hurwitz, president of
Albright College, and Thomas Flynn,
provost and vice president of Milliken
University, have already visited the
college as part of the search process.

matters of admission, employment
and housing, and in access to and
participation in its educ tion pro-
grams, services and activ 'es,"

Duke said that the prevention and
addressing of issues of discrimina-
tion are among Grinnell‘s core val-
ues, “We must have clear, effective
procedures in dealing with issues of
discrimination and we have to act in
a straightforward, honest, and effec-
tive mannerin addressing such issues
when they arise to make certain they
do not reoccur," he stated,

Athletic Director Dee Fairchild
was also unavailable for comment.

News of the case has been spread-
ing slowly across campus in the past
few weeks. Student sympathy seems
to reside with Mr. Howard and his
charges. One student who wished to
remain anonymous stated, “Working
for this college is really difﬁcult. The
case with Coach Howard is really
exemplary of the frustrations that
people have working for this cole

FINANCIAL AID Evaluating Grinnell’s policies, cont. from p. 1

tuition, room, and board fees only
cover 53% ofthe actual cost ofa year
at Grinnell, have resulted in the
school winning accolades for its rela-
tive affordability, For the past three
years, Grinnell has been recognized
by us. News and World Report as
the nation’s best liberal arts college
buy.

There are, however, downsides
to even the best ﬁnancial aid deals.
While Grinnell awards much more
money in grants and scholarships
than in loans, the average indebted-
ness among members of the class of
1996 was $11,440. In addition, al-
though students have generally ex-
pressed satisfaction with their ﬁnan-
cial aid packages from Grinnell.
some do not get the aid they feel they
need. This may be a result of aspects
of Institutional Methodology calcu-
lations, which can be less generous
than their FM counterparts
HOW GRINNELLIANS FEEL
ABOUT FINANCIAL AID

Predictably, the majority of cur-
rent Grinnell students polled seemed
to be happy with the ﬁnancial assis-
tance granted to them by the school,
“Considering my family’s income
and compared to other schools, I
think my financial aid from Grinnell
has been good," said Melissa Booker
‘98: Sang Hee Won ‘01 agreed, say-
ing, “1 think they‘ve been fair to me,”
“The ﬁnancial aid ofﬁce is generally
good at responding to students, “Jes-

sica Moore ‘98 concurred.

There are students, however,
who question some ofthe Grinnell’s
ﬁnancial aid policies. Although he
was not strongly upset about decie
sions made by the ﬁnancial aid of-
fice. Brandon Martinez ‘01 com-
mented, “I think the results from the
forms are a bit deceiving. What they
say you can afford and what you can
actually afford are two different
things."

Opinions were also somewhat
mixed on the subject of how ﬁnan-
cial aid packages change from year
to year. “Need-blind awards do not
change after a student’s ﬁrst year,"
said Woods. “We have no incentive
to change them, and it makes no logi-
cal sense to do that. The only two
circumstances that merit a change in
awards are a change in family in-
come or expenses, or a change in the
number of students a family has in
college" Sam Gipe ‘98 agreed that
the assistance he has received from
the college has been responsive to his
needs, and differed only when he
needed it to change, “I started out as
a dependent,” he explained. “Now
I’m independent of my parents, and
my grant and loan amounts have
gone up accordingly.“

Otherindividuals, such as Kristy
Zivich, originally a member of the
class of 1998, have a different story
to tell, Zivich, who now attends
Marquette University in Milwaukee,

page one

Moon ‘95, a Grinnell graduate in Art—
thropology who currently serves as
Assistant Curator of the Physics Mu-
seum.

Moon began working with Gale
during the summer of 1997 when,
according to her, the museum was “in
a severe state of disarray."

Gale helped her locate particular
items and gave her information re-
garding each object:

Moon marveled at the rare and
precious items Gale produced for his
museum, describing him as a “pack
rat" with a great sense of humor and
special personality.

“He was always laughing, always
smiling at people," she remembered,

Gale’s friendly attitude and teach-
ing skill won him a large student fol-
lowing, including famous Grinnell
alums like musician Herbie
Hancock, astronaut George Simon,
and physicist Robert N. Noyce, who
co-invented the integrated circuit.

“From what] can tell, his students
were more important than anything
else for him," said Moon. “All the
research he did was for them, and his
studenm just loved him,“

Gale noted in a 1994 Grinnell
Magazine article that his proudest
achievements were physics majors at
the college,

“The relationship he had with (the
students)," said Cadmus, “made
them love him and love studying

Physics with him."

Large alumni contributions to the
college also indicate student appre-
ciation for Gale.

“He was so giving to his stu-
dents," said Moon, “that they were
always giving back,”

Recognition of Gale’s life and
work permeated the entire campus
community, and reunions often high
lighted his humorous presentations
of museum items:

According to Cadmus, the ﬁrst
faculty meeting of every fall began
with an introduction of Gale.

"l'hat tradition," noted Cadtnus,
“is an indicator of the depth and
warmth of the college’s feelings for
him."

Other signs of Gale’s positive
impact on the Grinnell community
are the recently established memo—
rial fund and the Grant 0. Gale Ob-
servatory.

Dedicated in 1984, the observa-
tory was a source of enjoyment for
Gale, who loved bringing friends and
family for tours of the building.

A skilled physicist, devoted pro—
fessor and‘constant friend, Gale was,
according to Cadmus, a “ﬁxture" in
the campus community who will
never be forgotten

A memorial service to commemo-
rate his extraordinary contributions
to the college and community will
be held at 2 pm Saturday, May 16,

The service will take place at the
United Church of Christ Congrega-
tional on Fotu‘th and Broad Streets,
in Grinnell,

said that the financial assistance
awarded to her by Grinnell “was cut
tremendously“ after her freshman
year. Knowing that her family would
be unable to pay for her next year at
Grinnell without more aid, Zivich
drove to Grinnell in the August be
fore her sophomore year to appeal
the decision. Although she presented
her case before the ﬁnancial aid of-
ﬁce and obtained support from ad—
ministration and faculty members,
her request for more assistance was
tumed down. She was left with no
option but to transfer to another
school, despite the fact that she “tee
ally wanted to come back to
Grinnell...I had lots of friends there
and was attached to the school. 1 was
very upset when 1 found out that I
wouldn't be able to return."

Zivich felt that she was treated
badly by Grinnell because “they ob-
viously had the money, and there was
no reason not to give it to me - 1 had
good grades and liked Grinnell a lot."

“I suspect their motives too,”
she added. “After this happened to
me, I heard from other older students
that this was kind of a tradition at
Grinnell - that they cut some people’s
aid after freshman year because
you‘ve made friends and feel like
you belong there, I think they
thought that if I and other students
wanted to be at Grinnell badly
enough we would find the extra
money somewhere."

The 5&8 will not be
published next week.

FINANCIAL AID
AND MATRICULATION

Whether or not students encoun-
ter troubles with ﬁnancial aid after
coming to Grinnell, most agree that
aid offers are a signiﬁcant factor in
students’ decisions to attend the
school. “Students should decide
where to go based on the character
of the school, and financial aid
should be secondary," commented
Woods. “But it is true that students
from families that need money can’t
go to school without it." Oma
McLaughlin ‘99 commented, “[Fi-
nancial aid] was an important factor
in my decision to come here. It’s
really expensive and people wouldn’t
be able to come otherwise." “Aid
made a difference in my case," con-
curred Emily Cripe ‘01. “I know a
lot of people who came to Grinnell
because the aid offered here was bet-
ter.“

Prospectives recently on cam-
pus also felt that the assistance of-
fered to them by Grinnell would have
an important impact on their big de-
cisions. “I was impressed by the
amount of money Grinnell offered
me," said high school senior and ad-
mitted student Ben Weiss of
Dartmouth, Massachusetts. “Com-
pared to other schools Grinnell is
cheap to begin with, and they gave
me money when other schools didn't.
My ﬁnancial aid package is enough
to put Grinnell higher up on my list -
it’s deﬁnitely an important deciding
factor.“
