But nary a clue to his name. He’s
been playing this game ever since the
Mystery Object was born. And his
responses always come in typed form,
just like in the best whodunits, so
there‘s no identiﬁable clue about his

Actually, this Mystery Object is

Soggy weather
still hampering
farmers

Above-normal precrpitatioil con-
tinues to keep farmers out ofthc fields
in Iowa, while muddy conditions in
feed lots are taking atoll on livestock,
according to the Iowa Department of
Agriculture's weekly report on crops
and weather.

Statewtde average precipitation last
week was 1.23 inches, well above the
normal of.75 ofan inch forthistime of
year. Temperatureswereinthcnormal
range, with highs of 72 degrees in
Sioux City on Monday and Sidney on
Tuesday, and a low of 25 degrees in
Sibley on Friday morning.

“Wet conditions in the fields have
kept farmers from doing any signiﬁr
cantﬁeldworkthis spring." Iowa Sec-
retary of Agriculture Dale Cochran
added. “While seedbed prepamtion is
65 percent complete, ahead ofthe nor
mal 52 percent complete at this time,
most ofthat work was done last fall.
Last week, 60 percent ofthe seedbed
had been prepared. Soil temperatures
on Sunday were in the high 405 to low
505 statewide.

“Muddy conditions have also led to
higher-than—normal losses in the
spring’s calf crop. Incidents of calf
scours are present across the state.
Cattle gains are below expectations
because of dimculty in feeding and
cattle ﬁghting the mud and milk pro-
duction has also been affected."

Topsoil moisture statewide was rated
36 percent adequate and 64 percent
surplus.

involved in some way.

At the same time, Grinnell College
was hosting its annual Waltz, with

' students dressing in formal attire for

the annual spring event.

And down at the The Depot Cross-
ing, now under the new management
of Paul and Kalyn Durr, a sneak pre-
view was underway of its facility and
menus complete with live music.

This hastumed outtobeorle ofthose
weeks that proves Murphy's Law that
says that anything that can possibly go
wrong, will.

Actually, it started last Friday and
backed up into this week. On that fate-
ful day, the press broke down at the
Newton Daily News where the Her-
ald-Register and its other publications
are printed. ,

It also was the weekend that per-
sonnel from most newspapers in cen»
tral Iowa and the rest ofthe state were
in Des Moines attending the convenr
tion of the Iowa Newspaper Associa
tion, so some key folk at surrounding
newspapers were not around to conr
sult.

Totally missing its printing sched-
ule at the Daily News on Friday was
Grinnell College's Scarlet and Black
and a companion publication, The
Creature, whichhad to wait until Mon-
day to be printed, making somc ofthe
information in it irrelevant.

That ponended that the Herald-Reg-
ister also could not be printed at the
Daily News on its Monday press day.

After a hectic weekend by many of
its staff members because of pushed up
deadlines, The Herald-Register and the
Herald-Register Extra were delivered
to the Marshalltown Times-Republi—
can on Sunday night to be printed at
6:15 am. Monday.

Although the Scarlet and Black was
delivered to the H-R ofﬁce on Mon-
day, the Herald-Register delivery ve~
hicle had to make two runs to
Marshalltown Monday to pick up the
H-R and the Extra, then rush back to
insert, count andaddress the papers for
the carriers and post office, as well as
assemble and deliver the Scarlet and
Black to the college.

A vanishing cditor on a week’s va~
cation compoundedthe situation which
undoubtedly will grow worse until he
returns.

All ofwhich goesto provethatnoth-
ing will go right when it can get away
with lt~or somesuchl

Discrimination
against school

To the editor:

On behalf of New Horizons Alters
native High School, We would like to
make it few comments about our pro-
gram. Wc feel there is a lot ofdiscriinir
nationtoward ourschool. Many people
think that the alter-native school is an
easy way out. There's nothing easy
about it.

For example, New Horizons students
must have at least a B— to pass any paper,
any test orany class at all, no exceptions.
Bycontrast,atthetraditionalhighschool,
students can pass a class With a grade as
low as 30-. So ratherthan beinganeasler
program, many of us ﬁnd it more chal-
lenging. New Horizons studcnts must
meet an attendance requirement in order
to stay in the program, Expectations of
attendance are high, and students meet
those expectations.

The concern and one-on-onc atten-
tion our teachers give us is great. They
make us feel like we’re Worth some-
thing. They encourage us to accom-
