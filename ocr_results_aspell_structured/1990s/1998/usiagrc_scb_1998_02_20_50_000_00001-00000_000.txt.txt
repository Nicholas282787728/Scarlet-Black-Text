proposed spreading bubonic plague on the New York sub-
way were charged yesterday with possessing deadly an—
thrax bacteria. A lawyer for one of the two men, biology
laboratory owner William Leavitt, said no anthrax attack

Radon Said To Be Killing Thousands

A new report says radon is killing between 15,000 and
20,000 Americans every year. The National Research
Council study says smokers have an especially high risk
of developing cancer from exposure to the invisible ra-
dioactive gas found in virtually every home. The report
says indoor radon contributes to about 10 to 15 percent
ofthe lung cancer deaths each year in the United States
Radon is produced when uranium found naturally in rocks
and soil breaks down, It disperses very quickly in the
open air but can concentrate in closed areas, such as a

 

house or a mine tunnel.

Dialogue Affirms Importanceof Faculty Diversitly'
Duke: “Faculty diversity is extremely important; one of our core va ues”

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

On February 2, Interim President
Charles Duke rescinded a descision that
might have adversely affected Grinnell’s
efforts to increase diversity within the fac»
ulty. .

At a February 1 meeting with the fac~
ulty, Duke announced that he would not

. accept proposals from departments to exa

tend contracts for temporary faculty. In
opposition, faculty members presented a
strong front againstDuke’s decrsion. The
following day, be reversed his decision,
stating that he would indeed accept such
proposals.

At the February 1 meeting Duke, citv
ing his position as Interim President, said
that a permanent president would be bet-
ter fit to make such decisions.

The faculty argued that the adoption
of Duke: plan would stall the college's
long-term priority ofdiversifying its fac-

ulty as the bulk of temporary positions are
filled by minorities.

Sociology Professor Christopher
Hunter said that “[the faculty response]
reminded [Duke] of the paramount im»
ponance ofnot slowing down ourefforts."
Faculty members contended that those
affected were already present at the col»
legs, and that they had shown themselves
tO be pOSltiVe contributors to the current
community.

Hunter sympathized with Duke’s po-
sition: “He was faced with a difficult de-
cision," he said. He explained that Duke
had to reconcile two differing viewpoints:
the needs of the departments in the col-
lege, and the need to restrict the interim
position to as little as posstble Hunter said
he felt that Duke had focused on the lat»
ter, compromising the needs of the depart»
ments, Professor of Sociology Lisa
Avalos-Bock said, “I don‘t think the origi-
nal decision, . .reflects the faculty and the
priorities of the institution."

Mike Jacobs ‘98, present at the Febru»
dry I meeting, found the original decision
unfortunate. He explained that although
the college attempts to increase the num-
ber of minority and female faculty mem-
bers, the decision not to retain the faculty
“sends a message as far as how important
these faculty really are for the college."

Students present at the meeting were
encouraged by the support shown by the
faculty for diversity. Nicolas Schapira ‘01
said, “It shows that it’s not only the stu-
dents Who want a more diverse Grinnell.
but it’s the faculty members themselves
It felt good to see that [multicultural
students] are not the only ones fighting."

Priya Coulagi ‘98 agreed. “I was re-
ally pleased about the general support for
diversity by the faculty, They were not
afraid to say what they felt," she said.

SGA President Erin Childress im-
pressed by the faculty. “What was also
really encouraging was that as soon as
Duke saw the implication of his actions,

he decided that [his original decision]
wasn‘t a good option," she said,

Faculty agreedAvalosBOCkcommended
his ability to “listen to the alternative view-
point, [and] be convinced by it."

Duke explained his reason for recon-
sidering: “What I realized. . .[was] the
need to move as quickly as we can. . .we
should not be putting on hold these par
ticular strategies." He admitted, “For
these particular strategies, I was just
wrong."

Duke stated that “faculty diversity is
extremely important. [It is] one of our
core values [and] one of our major
goals."

Coulagi felt that Duke's final decision
promised hope for increasing diversity.
“I think it shows a Commitment for
multiculturalism," she said.

Hunter concurred: “There’s a long
way to go. I think we‘re making progress.
. . It’s either going to be a slow process or
require a big change. . .but we can do it."

Grinnell students protest U.S. involvment in Iraq

RISE organizes rally to raise awa

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

On Monday, February 16. Grinnell’s
RISE political action group held an on»
campus demonstration protesting poten»
tial United States involvement in Iraq.
The protest, which was held on the west
side of the Forum. attracted about 130
observers who came despite rain and 40
degree temperatures.

The rally featured presentations by
members of Catholic Workers, the Social-
ist Worker‘s Party, American Friends So-
ciety and Grinnell sophomore Molly
Gardner, senior Sonam Lama Sherpa and
senior Timur Rahman. The protest folr
lowed RISE‘s February 13 discussion of
the situation in the Middle East.

“Basically what we want to do is to
educate and inform people in the commu-
nity and on campus," said RISE member
Nicole Jacobs ‘01. "We also want people
to know there is wide spread disagreement
with US. involvement in Iraq.” Jacobs
was pleased with the results of a week of
planning. “It took tremendous energy to
get this together, but it turned out well.“

Grinnell Junior Jeff Gepner attended
the Friday discussion and felt the presen»
tation was inaccurate and one-sided. “I
thought it was awful. The idea that was

thrown around that the United
States was involved in a con-
spiracy with other western na-
tions to destroy Iraqi culture is
absurd." Nonetheless, Gepner
was impressed with RISE’S
work, “I'm amazed how well
they've gone and mobilized.
It‘s pretty impressive."

First year student Shana
Barchas, who also attended the
event, was uncertain about her
position regarding us. ac»
tions. “Although I'magainsta 3:
military strikc,1 was hesitant
about the protest because I hone
estly know very little about the 4

.situation in Iraq," said Barchas.

“[I] didn't want to get swept up
in the idea ofa protest without ‘
fully understanding the situa- 4
tion, but overall, I’m glad I
went."

Father Frank Rodent of the Catholic
Workers spoke at the rally and was
pleased with RISE‘s efforts and the Grin-
nell turnout. In ashort interview after his
speech, he advocated diligent work for
causes such as peace and equal rights.
“There are so many people who are con-
vinced the right thing to do is to strive to
get rich,“ he said,

Week-Long Celebration of
International Diversity

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Contributing Writer

“Sometimes, it’s difﬁcult being in an
alien culture. . .It‘s comforting to see
people showing interest in and accepting
my [own] culture."

For students like Kavita Coulagi ‘00,
promoting interest and acceptance is a cen-
tral goal of International Diversity Week.

The week begins February 21 with a
sit~down banquet of foods from around
the world; continues with a fun fair, mow
ies and performances; and concludes on
the 28th with the International House of
Fashion party at the Harris Center. Each
of the week's events is open to the com»
munity. .

Everyone is welcome “because the
point is .. , to involve the whole campus
in international activities," explained
Kavita Coulagi, president ofthe Interna»
tional Student Organization [ISO].

Kavita Coulagi and Priya Coulagi ‘98
are two of the event’s principal coordina-
tors. Priya Coulagi, who heads the Inter»
national Speakers Program [ISP], con-
ceived the idea oflnternational Diversity
Week three years ago, when she attended
the University of Iowa’s Cultural Divcrr
sity Days. The large-scale celebration
there, involving booths, performances,
food, and a large proportion of the city
inspired her to begin a similar tradition at
Grinnell. While Grinnell had originally
observed a single Diversity Day, Priya
helped expand the celebration into a

week-long event.

Another change occurred this year
when ISO joined ISP in the coordination
process, and the name of the event was
changed again from Diversity Week to
International Diversity Week. “Hope-
fully, the cooperation effort [between ISO
and ISP] is going to make [International
Diversity Week] really special," com»
merited Kavita Coulagi.

Despite the changes in the event’s
name and coordinators, the essential goal
of International Week remains the same:
to promote cultural awareness. Explained
Priya Coulagi, “I felt the international stu-
dent presencc on campus was not noticed
enough. Even though [international stu»
dents comprise eight percent of the stu-
dent body], people tend to forget there is
a world outside of Grinnel .1‘Thc empha-
sis, she said, is on celebration: “This is
not a high»stress celebration."

Aside from promoting awareness, Ins
ternational Diversity Week also highlights
pride For example, booths at the Inter»
national Fun Fair will present cultural Lra-
dttions including Merleridi, an Indian art
form, Greek dance, the tango, and even
swear words from various languages.
Also, the ISO Cultural Evening will show-
case students' talents for performing
songs, readings, or dances from their own
cultures. Kavlta Coulagi deemed Inter
national Diversrty chk ”u valldatlon of
people's cultures in that, for that week,
they get to display what they feel is beau-
tiful about their culture "

Tom Alten of the Socialist Worker's
Party also spoke. ”The need to protest
the war plans of the US. government is

people» this is about oil and this is about

Unprecedented Endowment
Growth: Fund For Excellence

1 BY COURTNEY SHERWOOD
Staff Writer

Out of a desire to-encourage “innova-
tive projects that are consistent with
Grinnell‘s core values and long term
goals," and due to unprecedented endow—
ment growth, the Board of Trustees voted
to create a 5.7 million dollar Fund of Ex-
cellence, the Board announced in a Feb»
ruary 12 statement.

“The trustees are very excited about the
creation ofthe Fund for Excellence," said
Chair of the Board ofTrustees Elizabeth
Ballentine. “We‘re hoping this will enable
the college community to find new ways
of expressing the core values of the col—
lege."

“The board expects that projects sup-
ported from this fund [will] result in sub-
stantial improvements to an already ex-
cellent undergraduate Grinnell educa-
tion," said Interim President Charles Duke
in a letter to the Grinnell College com—
munity.

Despite the Board‘s broad deﬁnition Of
the new Fund for Excellence, trustees
made It clear that decisions regarding its
implementation will be made on campus.
“We think that students and others ‘who
are at Grinnell on a daily basis understand
the school's needs and interests best," Said
Ballentinc.

In order to establish criteria for fund
allocation the Grinnell College Council
on Core Values and Institutional Excel»
lence has been established to develop

“core values and the working definition
of excellence [which] can then be used
by the college in considering proposals
for institutional improvement,” Duke an-
nounced.

The Council on Core Values will be
chaired by Interim President Duke and
will include fourmembers ofthe faculty,
four students, three members of the ad
ministration and three members of the
staff, Already appointed to faculty slots
on the committee are Professor Paula
Smith, who is involved in Grinnell‘s self-
study committee, and Professor Irene
Powell, who is on the presidential search
committee.

The Fund for Excellence will gain
monetary supportin the 1999 fiscal year.
“Unused funds will carry over to the next
budget year to add to funds allocated in
subsequent years," Duke announced, It
was made possible by Grinnell’s endow-
ment, which increased by nearly ten per-
cent, more than the 1999 budget origi-
nally had planned for.

A series of open meetings has been
announced by Duke to’allow “all mem»
bers ofthe Grinnell campus community
7 students, faculty and staff“ an oppor-
tunity to contribute to the Council on
Core Values‘ initial planning. The meet»
ings will take place on Monday at
4:15pm in the South Lounge, Thursday
at noon in the North Lounge and Friday,
February 27 at 4:15pm In the South
Lounge and are open to the campus com-
munity.
