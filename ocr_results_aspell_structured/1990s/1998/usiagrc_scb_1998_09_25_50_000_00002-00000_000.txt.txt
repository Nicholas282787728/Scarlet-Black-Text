After two successive home victo-
ries, the Grinnell College football team
will test its mettle this week on ﬁre
road at Lake Forest. “We will have
our work cut out for us,“ commented
Grinnell coach Greg Wallace. “They
are one of the most improved teams
in our league.”

The Lake Forest contest is
Grinnell's second Midwest Conference
outing. The last time the Pioneers
faced the Foresters was in 1993 and
LFC won, 22-21. Both reamswill be
playing to stay atop the leader column,
Last Saturday on the opening day of
loop competition the Foresters beat
Monmouth on the road, 20-] 5, while
the Pioneers downed Beloit, 37-14.

“Lake Forest is a good football
team, They run die ballwellwith their
option scheme and they play sound
defense. With a large group of start-
crs returning, Lake Forest has gotten

a great start to the season. Coach
Randy Moore and his staff deserve a
lot of crodit for the way they have
turned their program around," ex»
plained Wallace.

Afterstopping Grinnell on its first
defensive stand, Beloir marched down
to take a 7-0 lead, Later in the first
quarter the Pioneers mounted a drive
which culminated in a 41-yard field
goal by Nate Solmosc. over the next
three quarters Grinnell scored 34 un-
answered points to seal the victory.
Beloit added a scorewith 3:30 remain
ing.

“Beloit did a great job early in the
game. We didn’t execute well but they
really came after us. Maybe the score
doesn’t show it, but they are a much
improved team," offered Wallace.

During the second period Troy
Dougherty found David Snider and
Richard Werner on 23- and 42—yard

scoring passes. Midway through the
third stanza Doughetty hit Werner
again on a 29-yard TD strike and late
in the quarter Snider hauled down a
22-yardcr for a score. Werner cappcd
the Pioneer total with a 30-yard TD
reception in the fourth quarter.

Dougheity completed 17 of 25
passes for 264 yards and five TDs.
Werner and Snider each had seven
catches for 143 and 96 yards respec-
tively. Tailback Wade Krause led the
ground game with 153 yards on 22
carries. The Pioneers posted 457 yards
oftotal offense.

“We were a little slow out of the
gate, but I was pleased with the way
our players stayed focused and got
better with the execution,” said
Wallace.

The Pioneer defense rallied after
Beloit's first drive, shutting the Bucs
down for the remainder of the first
half. At the beginning of the sccond
halfBeloit drove inside Grinnell's 10»
yard line but Matt Amendt stopped
the QB for no gain on first down and
Stan Banks intercepted a pass in me
end zone on second down.

Inside linebackers Torn Jams and
Josh Rehmann led the charge with
nine and eight stops. Rchmann joined
with Beau Hurtig to get a sack.
Amendt had six tackles, including four
for asses and posted two sacks.

“I am really pleased with our de-
fense,” noted Wallace. “Beloit is very
big on the offensive line and we stayed
low to combat that. We also do a great
job ofhustling to the foorball,"

In prc-season conference polls the
Pioneers were picked second and thc
Foresters were noted as an up—and—
coming team, Wallace emphasized,
“With our new league format ofplay—
ing all nine other teams, there are no
weeks off, This game is a perfect ex-
ample. take Forest is a talented foot-
ball team which has a chance to be in
first place with a win Saturday."

golf team when it plays at the Knox
Invitational this Friday. The Pioneers
also compete at the st. Ambrose In»

good picturcofthc course," explained
Coach Dcc Fairchild, “We know it is
a difficult coursc from tournaments
played there in past years, but we’re
an improved team this season."

Last Saturday the Pioneers showed
great improvement over previous out.
ings by shooting 429 at the Luther Inc
vitarional. Simpson won the tourney
with 326 and the Pioneers placed 13th
out of l 5 teams.

her success with another top lo per»
formancc by placing 3rd with an so.

“Hilary is very steady," notcd
Fairchild, “In most cases she is chalc
lenging veteran golfers who have alc
ready played the tournament courscs,
she remains focused and mentally
solid.”

Sarah Pohlman produced solid
marks with a 107, shaving nine strokes
from her best total. Jessica Dvorak
remained steady, firing a 12l, while
Sarah Miller lowered her score from
last week with a 121.

“I‘m very pleased with Sarah
Pohlman's performance. If she stays
around 100, shc and I would be very
pleased with her scores,” said Fairchild.

The coach also complimcntcd
Emily Westergaard, who scored 129,
as playing more consistent.

“We did a lot ofwork on putting
and shots from 100 yards in last week.
i think the scores Saturday indicated
some improvement. our goal is to get
undcr400. Hopefully with some con.
tinued work we will achieve it,"

Spa'ts Information
last Saturday the Grinnell college
Women’s cross country team hosted 14
teams and 152 runners at the Les
Duke Invitational. The meet was the
first 5k race of the season and the
team’s only home meet at Oakland
Acres golf course. The Grinnell
women placed fourth with 176 points
behind Wartburg (21), Carleton (48)
and Coe (150).
“The times were slow for the
ﬁeld,” said coach Evclyn Freeman.

She attributed this to a somewhat dif-
ficult course and the hotweathct. Al.
though Grinnell’s women did not 5qu
fct dramatically from the wcadrct, sev»
cral runners were sent to the hospital.
Because ofthe slower times, Ftceman
was surprised with the team's placing.
She explained their deceptively suc.
cessful ﬁnish by saying, “We don't have
any superstars, but our runners tun
close together.”

ACE Securiiy expands SGA BOX
presence on campus

NATHAN WELLER
Staff Writer

Anyone who has participated in a
social function this semester has prob-
ably observcd, wim expected apprchcn.
sion, a growing number of security
present at SGAsponsored events. As of
this year, a ncw security task force has
been formed to ensure thesaferyandwcll
being ofstudents.

The ACE Security, headed by the
ACE Coordinator sarah Asch ‘99, will
be on hand at all Harris events and
Gardner concerts, as well as at the fcs-
dvities occurring this weekend at Alice.

main responsibility is not to apprehend
studcno for misconduct, but to make
sure mat everyone is our of harms way.

“Thepurposc ofACEsecurity is not
to get people into trouble, but to keep
them from getting hurt at SGA func.
tions," Asch said.

Many people have misunderstood
the intentions of this new security force
and have associated it assign impending
thrmt upon student righn and privileges.
Manymorcstudents,who havcatttnded
SGA functions and are unaware of the

changcs to security, have mistaken ACE
Security for a branch ofcampus Secu-
rity, which provides a complctcly differ-
ent service. However, these apprehens
sions are completely unwarranted, ac-
cording to Asch, for ACE Security and
Campus securiryarc two completely dif
fcrcnt orpnimtions.

“At the first Gardner Concert, many
people citprcsscd theirconccms about the
growing number ofsccunty personnelon
the premises," said Asch, who assures rhc
smdcnr body that “security at Grinnell
is no different than it was before, it only
has a different look," but ACE security
should not be mistaken with Grinnells
security dtpartment.

campus sccurity has many func-
tio icycle registration, escort service,
building monitoring and lock and run
ning drc security office in Meats Ease
mtnt 24 hours a day seven days a weck.

Besides securing the safety of party-
goers, ACE Security also enforcu basic
rules already established by thcscA, such
as mandatory lD card cliedrs at SGA
sponsored events. This prevents uns
wanted nonstudonn from cnrcringSGA
functions underccrtd, and hirthcrcnsurn
a safe environment for the students
within.

The ACESccutltystafrprides them-

selves on being an organization of the
utmost responsibility and work ethic,
which was lacking in previous student
security forces, according to Asch.

“There were lots of problems with
security in the past," she said, “people
showing up late, unprepared to work, or
not showing up at all. It’s notacccptablc.
A security staff must be conscious, be
cause of its hefty Icsponsibilides of keep-
ing people safe and out of harms way."

anitc me original anxiety felt by
most students towards dice new secur
riry measures, many more have exprmsed
their appreciation for added protection
at all campus events and parties.

“People wcrc glad that security was
there to keep people who didn’t belong
out, said Asch. The organizers of the
events were also very pleased}

Added security provided by ACE
should most certainly not be felt as a
threat to students, but rather as a wel»
come addition to die social events and
happenings which makes Grinncll the
wonderful college that it is.

"ACE Security is more about safety,"
reiterated Asch, ”men enforcing any
harsh rules upon students.”

ACE security is rchiring at me be»
