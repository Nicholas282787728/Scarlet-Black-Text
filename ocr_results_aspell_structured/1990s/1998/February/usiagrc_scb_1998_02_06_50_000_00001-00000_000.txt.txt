The United States boosted its ﬁrepower in the Gulf re-
gion Thursday with the arrival of a third aircraft carrier
in the strategic waterway, as President Clinton consid-
ered whether to use military force against Iraq. Signs
emerged of Iraqi concessions in the standoff over United
Nations efforts to rid Baghdad ofits suspected weapons
of mass destruction. However, Britain and France said
the UN did not go far enough. Russian President Boris
Yeltsin declared that the worst of the crisis IS over, but
he repeated his warning that a U.S. military strike could
trigger World War III.

Japan Emphasizes Olympic Truce Policy
The Japanese government plans to ask the United States
and Iraq to observe a U.N:backed“01ympic Truce" durr
mg the Nagano Winter Olympic Games, which start toe
morrow. In announcing its plans, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said it feels obliged, as the host of the games,
to make the request. Earlier this week UN. Secretary
General Kofi Arman called on all UN. member nations

said this week it was aware that any attack on Iraq dur~
ing the Games would break the traditional “Olympic
Truce." But it said the US, government must make its
own decisions, ’

France Won’t Join Any Raids

France says the United States and Britain are isolated in
considering bombing Iraq and it will not join in any milie
tary action against Baghdad, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine also said that Iraq had shown the first
signs of ﬂexibility in the conﬂict over giving access to
United Nations arms inspectors, Though this was not
enough to satisfy U.N. demands, France was urging Iraq
to build on it to reach an agreement paving the way for a
resumption of arms inspections by the UN. Special Com-

Cable-Cutting Plane Off Course

A U.S. warplane that caused a cable car accident that
killed 20 people had strayed from its pre»set route and
flew under the cable lines, Italy’s Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta said yesterday. He said the plane
was ﬂying off its preaestablished route by 6 miles and
should not have been lower than 2,000 feet "There would
not have been any danger had the aircraft kept to the
regulations," Andreatta said. The U.S. Marines prowler
surveillance plane cut through steel cables with its tail
fin while flying at a height of around 300 feet. When the
cable was cut, a cable car descending from Cermis mounr
lain to the ski toWn of Cavalese plunged to the ground,
killing all 20 passengers,

Germans Protest Jobless Rate

Thousands ofj obless shouting “Kohl out" demonstrated
in Germany Thursday, as ofﬁcial figures confirmed that
unemployment in Germany soared to a post-World War
II record last month. The official ﬁgures counted 4.82
million jobless in January, up from 4.52 million in De»
ccmber. Economists predict the number of unemployed
could continue to grow. The situation prompted about
2,000 unemployed to march to the Brandenburg Gate in
Berlin, demanding the ouster ofChancelIor Helmut Kohl.
The situation is bad election-year news for Kohl, who
came under ﬁre not only on the streets but also in parlia-
ment.

U.N. experts called on the United States yesterday to
resist business opposition and ratify the world’s ﬁrst

biggest polluting country reject the U.N.-backed attempt
to curb emissrons of gases believed responsible for warmr
ing the planet, "We desperately need the U.S. to be a full
player to make it work," Robert Watson, chairman of
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told
Reuters. “There is no way that Europe and Japan will
ratify if the US, doesn't."

Death Penalt

Debated

Iowa legislature consi ers capital punishment

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Editorrianhief

A bill that would reinstate capital pun-
ishment in Iowa has been introduced into
the State House of Representatives, stir-
ring strong sentiments among citizens on
both sides of the issue. The bill, which is
currently being studied and amended by
a Judiciary Subcommittee, was brought
to the House on January 26 of this year
by a coalition of 26 representatives.

Iowa politicians last made a move to
reinstate the death penalty in 1995. At
that time, the bill passed in the House of
Representatives. but was overwhelmingly
rejected in the state Senate.

Although intense lobbying by mem-
bers of Iowans Against the Death Penalty
and other anti-death penalty activists has
slowed the progress of the bill, observers
believe that the issue could be resolved
relatively quickly; “[The capital punish-
ment bill] could be voted upon next

week, " Patti Brown of Iowans Against the
Death Penalty said on Tuesday.

The likely outcome of this attempt to
reinstate the death penalty is still very
much open to question. As the bill was
introduced for legislative debate, Speaker
of the House Ron Corbett confidently
stated that there were enough pro-capital
punishment votes for the measure to pass
in the House. This prediction, however,
inspired increased fervor among antic
death penalty activists, and Corbett later
admitted that he might have made a tactic
cal mistake. But despite the successes of
lobbying efforts, he said that “I still feel
that we have the votes to pass the death
penalty,”

At a public hearing on the bill on
Wednesday evening, Citizens speaking
against capital punishment outnumbered
those speaking for the proposal by more
than ten to one, Among those in the
former Category were such highprorilc

Student Input Questioned

Staff Writer

An article III the Januaiy is, 1998 is
sue of The C/IIuIIicle oing/ier Educnr
[inn addressed several complex questions
on college cnmpuscs nationwrde. Do stun
dcril evaluations effectively evaluate fac-
lilly pcrfollnuncc7 Should these evalua-
tioiis play a prominent role in determin-
ing faculty advancement?

Giinncll College continues to grapple
with lltese issues.

According to last semester‘s Executive
Council Minutes, Grinnell Colicgc faculty
members are concerned that student
evaluations do not adequately assess their
abilities, especially when being consid-
ered for promotions.

Tile Clilmliclr concurs, explaining that
Iitislclidiiig‘ or untruiliful evaluations have

can further their careers by catering

largely to student desires. Either way, a
heavy focus on student evaluations ale
lows siudents‘ priorities, which may not
always be academic, to have incredible
bearing over faculty careers,

As a result, the faculty is often unenr
thusiastic about the weight put on stue
dent evaluations in determining their
advancement.

They are concerned, as stated in the
minutes, that if they “resist the idea of
student evaluation of courses, the board
[ofTruslccs] members will interpret that
as an unwillingness to be evaluated in
any real way."

The faculty‘s concern stems from
fears that student evaluations may not
accurately portray their teaching ability
or their importance to the campus com-
munity as a whole.

These fears may not be unfounded.
Although most students attempt to be
honest and fair, they may be unknow-

The Used Book Dilemma. High Prices, Low Return

BY SARAH RHINEHARD
Staff Writer

With the end of each semester, Grinnell
College students attempt to sell back their
unwanted books. Frustration often runs
high when students receive less money
than they had hoped for.

In many cases, the campus bookstore
is blamed for cheating customers out of a
fair trade.

“I felt like I could’ve gotten more out
of it if I’d tried to sell my book to a stun
dent,” said Mary Davis ‘01, who sold her
calculus text at the bookstore’s advertised
sale. “I got less than a third of the price
back than What I paid for it, and the book
was in really great shape, too.”

However, what is sometimes viewed
as being unique to Grinnell is actually a
nationwide phenomenon, and has little
to do with the college bookstores them-
selves.

According to the Grinnell College
Bookstore Business Manager Cassie
Wherry, used book wholesalers are in
charge of the sale policies, and simply
arrange a time with various college book-
stores to come and buy back student
books.

Grinnell College works with the Ne-
braska Book Co,, a wholesale company
that is involved with litany colleges na-
tionwide.

“They will buy books in any condir
tion," said Wherry, “as long as there isn‘t
a new edition of the book that‘s recently
been issued."

Once purchased from students, the
books are shipped back to a company

warehouse. where they are
stored until the wholesalers
are notified by colleges that
want to purchase the used
materials.

Because wholesalers can
never be Cerium of which
books wrli be needed by unr
versities, they can’t guaran-
tee customers very much
money for their used texts,
Students usually receive
30% of the original price or
less for any book, regardless
of its condition,

If professors notify the
campus bookstore of their
“adoptions" (reqmred rend
ings for the following
semester’s classes) in time
for the book sales, studcnls
are able to make more money
off of their texts.

“If we have an adoption
from a professor that come
mits to using acertain book,”
said Wlien'y, “the company
is able to buy that used book
from students at half the
original price.“

Grinnell College tlicn pui-
chases that book froiti the
wholesaler to be sold as
“Used” in the bookstore. Such texts are
usually priced at around 75% ofth Drlglr
rial cost.

Professors’ adoptions for the fall sc-
mesler are due in April, but often don‘l
arrive until the following summer, whcn
it is too late to give students the l’tﬂlfrpl‘lcc

Security Issues at the PEG

BY KATHRYN NONAS
Staff Writer

Several recent incidents at the
Physical Education Complex
[PEC] have called to attention
many Grinnellians’ lax attitudes
regarding security on campus.

The PEC prov1des an environ
ment for students and Grinnell
community members to work out
and relax which has been marred
by recent acts of theft, harassment
and vandalism.

Money and such valuable pos»
sessions as cameras, CD players
and athletic equipment have been
reported stolen by students.

According to Athletic Equip-
merit Director Roger Bauman this
problem can be traced to kids
ranging from nine to sixteen years
of age. Bauman said that “theft
isn‘t really that common. It hap-
pens just enough to make it very
aggravating."

The complacence (If students about than

Capers of Captain Condom

Latex on the run: GEAR promotes awareness

Continuing in the long history of
Grinnell College supcr heroes Captain

dynamic duo IS the brain child of
Grinnellinns Escalating Aids Response
[GEAR] and will be making frequent ap-
pcai‘ztnccs at local hot spots, handing out
condoms in the students at dorm and
house parties and other campus events

Almost every member of GEAR will
have an opportunity to play Captain Con-
doni or lhc Condom Fairy. GEAR hopes
this duo will mtikc condoms more accesr
sihlc to students, i

According to Anna Donovan ’01 who

Condom Fatty, Plojcct Condom “is an in
your face way to promote safer sex."

Cathy Slchouivcr '01, Captain Con-
dom herself, said this is “a full wzty of
increasing awareness,"

The two Super Iicrocs made their do
but appearance at the GEAR party at
Hnilis last Friday night and distributed
vast numbers of Premium condoms. Both
Slcllouwcr and Donovan said they were
itiiprcsscd wuh the response they received
and tire optiinislit: about the longevity of

In addition to giving otlt condoms, they

also distributed dental dams, latex gloves
and lubricants.

GEAR is also launching a search for
non-GEAR members to play Captain
Condom and the Condom Fairy. The rest
of the student body of Grinnell is being
given the opportunity to be either of these
two condom heroes. Information and
application forms are available at the
Stonewall Resource Center.

A survey taken several years ago re
vealed that over 50% of the student popur
lation ofGrinnell was ignorant ofthe fact
that STDs can be spread through oral sex,
Although the campus may be more edu-
cated today, GEAR continues to work
toward keeping the campus educated and
safe, Captain Condom and the Condom
Fairy are emphasizing the need for latex
barriers whilst indulging in oral, anal or
vaginal sex.

Both super heroes are required to stay
sober, maintain, confidentiality and be
knowledgeable about the items they will
be distributing.

GEAR is also working on providing
inexpensive, confidential AIDS testing
for Grinnell College students with Cole
lege-sponscred transportation provided.

All questions should be directed to
Captain Condom or the Condom Fairy
when they make their next public appear-
ance. As the loggia signs say, “Captain
condom cares.,.you should too."
