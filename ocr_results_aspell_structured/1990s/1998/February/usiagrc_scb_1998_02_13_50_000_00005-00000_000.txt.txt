A Foolish Consistency

BY IVY CHANG
Columnist

Sol was studying in Burling the
other night, when I dccidcd it was
umc for a bathroom break. Rntlicr
than takc the stairs all the way down
to the basement, I opted for the clr
cvator to third instead, I remembered
that Someone had once told me to
check out the bathroom tlicrc tur‘
some rcully ncat graffiti, but when I
had visited itcarlicr in the year, I had
been disappointed to Find the walls
mostly blank from rccciitly being
whitewashed Hoping to find some
kind or inspiration, or at a least form
of entertainment, among the more
recent additions, Isat down and her
gan to read the “writing on Ilic wall."
Amidst opinion polls that wanted to
know whether or not you likcd
women who smoked, cutc people on
campus you want to kiss, and cool
prprcs. us, l found an nngry dialogue
concerning the future of Gtitiiicll.
ltall‘strcakcd out by what I’m assum-
ing (hoping) was writer. nerds an e,
cerpt:

“Schools like . [Gruiiicll] are [pattl
of a dying breed and Grinncll is on
its last leg,”

“It wouldn't bother me if, [plcppy]
clothes weren't linked to a shallow,
conionnist stutc of mind. But they
are. You never used to heal anyone
callcd ‘bltch' at Griniicll, There was
no Cleveland 3rd ‘lratf Women
didn’t feel compclletl to wear
makeup I think calling people who
w wear Land's End ‘slobs' is Illl'
other symptom of this mind, , I
guess Grinncll will sacriltcc anything
for a higher US Nun‘s & thrlil Ril-
[IDI'I ranking."

“So truel What has/is happening to
Grinnclli”

So these arc the qucstious 1 come

to you with today. What it happens

the college to rely on selfrsclcclion,
bccliusc this leaves us with a rela-
tively small applicant pool to draw
from OI course. that same small apr
plicaiit pool this given us famous
musicians. invciitors, arid winners of
prestigious prizcs. but it also keeps
us from beating out other small lib-
crul art collcgcs (suicc that's ically

What it comes down to is this. Most

Gtitincll is not a household name

who sock us out arc the students who

Somcwhcrc a politician is plotting
his rise. Somewhere a politician is
trying to survtve; lies lies lies, their
weapon, their only weapon, because
everyone in their dccpcst most honr
est licart knows that they do not need
to he ruled, that ultimately they are
to dccidc on right and wrong, and
what indeed their best interests are,
that what they need is ancighbor that
lends a hand and not a government
hand, so large and attached to such a
many headed body that in its grasp
one is small and insignificant. SOme~
where a politician is denying his hur
mdnity and swearing he has made no
mistakes and Will make none in the
future. Somewhere a voteris bcliev-
ing that what he needs is a hundred
thousand more caps on the street, and
that his vote matters, and that all
voiccs matter, and that America is the
land ofthc free and democracy guar-
aiitce nclusion, Somewhereaman
issitting at a typewriter stoned out
of his head knowing that in this
America he is the loser, and every-
one that votes wins because they be-
have they have options and are not

OPINION

in fact voting for one branch or the
other of Ihc same decaying tree.
Somewhere an exhcon sits in my
tormcd meditation, his mind empty
of candidate slogans and the issues
of the day, without the right to vote,
with rights only to his own mind's
decisions. Somewhere a millionaire
becomes a billionaire and thinks of
the possibility of Lrillions. His phone
is always ringing as he has the power
to build a candidate and so many men
and a growing number ofwomen are
desperate for power and are willing
to present themselves as masses or”
clay to be formed into towers. Some-
where a child is eating a hearty
brcakfast and he‘s excited for school
cause that’s where his friends are and
he knows he's a democrat cause
daddy called the republican a son of
a bitch last night and he knows that
ain't good cause when mama called
him that he got real mad and the
doors slammed, Somewhere there's
a teacher who doesn’t know how to
teach the truth with the truth so well
hidden by the fury of debate; who
hears what the children say and
knows that there is a scary future
ahead. And somewhere in a bar a
woman asks for quiet when she
thinks Dave Letterman's giving an
endorsement, but at the end there's a
punch line and Bill Clinton says “No,
she was kneeling," and somewhere
there's at pp] ian who really cares
and IS working his ass Off and lives
are getting better because of it,
Somewhere there‘s a preacher won-
dering if anyone will ever question
the tax free status of his Church with

all this talk of reducing Lhe national
debt and saving social security.
Sometime he’s gonna bend his knees
and pray for a charismatic republi-
can, and sometime there’s going to
be a third party that succeeds and
then it will become the second party
as another crashes. There is only
room enough on the globe for two
hemispheres — there is hardly enough
room in America for two parties.
Maybe sometime the president will
be the guy that lays the most girls,
or the woman who ﬁnds the cutest
guy, or maybe the person most quali-
ﬁed, or maybe the son of a former
president, cause genes are genes and
old money never recmcrges new.
And sometime Jesus may come back
and judge us all and [doubt he checks
the voting rolls, and somewhere
there's a politician that‘s banking on
a godless death as he paddles war and
weapons and financial and moral
enslavemcnt to the meek, who eve
in prophecies will only inherit the ,-
world when the mighty have died:
Somewhere people are deciding to
relinquish their might so that they
may live as equals, somewhere
there‘s a band playing and people
dancing and worries burn as herb,
somewhere there are people who
approach the World with kindness.
who cast their vote with their neighA
borhood grocer, who vote for house
rules. Somewhere someone in this
world is righteous, and sometime we
will realize the vote is our own: right
or wrong, shall I awake or shall I lay
sleeping, shall I be free or shall I be
ruled.

 

Letters

To the Grinnell Community,

As concerned members of the
Grinnell community we call for an
immediate halt to the preparations for
war against Iraq, a cessation of po»
litical demands which neithcr Iraq
nor any utlicr country could bc ck»
pected to meet, and a beginning of
true political dialogue aimed at re-
having the suffering of the Iraqi
people and bringing Iraq back into
the community of nations. It is My
scemly and immoral for the world‘s
only superpower to be preparing for
a “punishing attack" against one of
the world's most impoverished na-
tions 7 a nation which for seven
years has been largely Without ad-
equate food, medicine, potable wa-
ter, or functioning electrical and sani-
ration systems. We condemn abso—
lutely tlic contemplation ofusing tacr
tical nuclear weapons to bomb Iraq.
No conceivable immediate benefit
could balance the future large scale
VlQlCllCC wlnch would be unleashed
by breaking the nonproliferatibn
treaty and legitimizmg the use oflacr
tical nuclear weapons.

Consxdcring the impending conser
quenccs ol'a war in Iraq, now is not
the time for silence. Please join us in
solidarity against a military strike
against Iraq.

There will be an open forum for dis-
cussion of the situtaion in Iraq this
afternoon at 4: 15 in tthoth lounge
ofthc Forum and a demonstration on
central campus on Monday the lbth

To our loyal subjects,
Too long has the utmost potential

ofGrinnell’s System of SelfGoverr .

nance been wasted on such frivolir
ties as the Student Government As»
sociation and the Waltz Committee.
It is time for the Students who com-
pose the Glorious Campus of the
College ofGrinnell to truly make use
of the power which has been foolr
ishly granted them by the gullible
and trusting administration. The
time has come for lhc Revolution to
hcgiii, and we have seized the oppor
tunity. The Campus Monarchists
hereby welcome you to the Glorious
Kingdom ofGrinnell. (Fanfare goes
here.)

How has it come to pass that what
you once considered to be a simple
and democratic campus has become
a complicated despotic hierarchy of
elite ci 'zens? The answer is quite
simple: the Halve administration

- which supposedly guards the Slu-
dents against forces of chaos and
usurpation has delightedly granted
this Collection of nefarious
disestablishmentarians their every
whim and desire simply because we
elected to establish control through
their fiendishrbutrlegal bureaucratic
system. Although our noble warriors
nearly fell to their dangerous forms
filed in triplicate and secretaries
armed with sharp rebukes and press
mg unSIIOIIS, they succeeded in
grasping the metaphoricalsword in
the stone.

Therefore, as our bushyrtailed lords
in the trees have predetermined,
Grinncll College has entered a great
age of benevolent despotism under
the divinely ordained rule of King
Benn I and Queen Monika. You will
notice certain subtle changes in the
makeup of your beloved College,
For example, the posting of obscure
Signs, the sudden promotion ofroom-
mates and Classmates (but never you)
to positions of extreme power, and
(he inspired banning of political or»
gamZnthrlS which might undermine
the position of our Glorious Regime.
Finally, as is natural in dictator
ships— benevolent or otherwisei
all local media publications are ex»
pccted to Censor themselves in a
manner befitting the monarchists,
until aroyzil censor can be appointed
to overlook this odious task.

Furllicr, we are now accepting sub-
missions for the position ofroyal in-

tern,
Tell [ROYALTY] if you are inter-
tasted.

Monarchy: It’s notjust for cross-
breccling hemophiliacs anymore.

To the Campus Community,

If you hold your study wearied-
head high enough in the crisp winter
air of Grinncll and inhale deeply
through your nose, you can smell it.
The enticing and lovely aromas, dis-
tinct yet interwoven, of sweat, phero-
mones, beer and almighty Brut.

If you catch a snowﬂake on your
tongue near Cowles on a given day.
you can taste it. The coming night '
full of liquid refreshment and
yummy snacks beyond any other. A
cucumber lover‘s paradise.

If you listcn hard enough through
the whispering winds oftlie midwest,
the clatter of the train and the chal-
tcr ofthe fattened squirrels, you can
hear il. The angelic voices and my
cessant beats of ABBA, The Ohio
Players and The Beches signal yet
another pilgrimage to the glass

walled Mecca of glitter and funk.
If you sit still long enough in the

hallowed halls of the Harris Center,
you can feel The wonderful feel
ofpolyestcr against your skin and the
ﬂoor—shaking gyration of bodies on
risers as 50 pairs of platform shoes
do their best to pay tribute to the
immortal moves of Travolta.

If you squint hard enough across , ~
Mac field, through the blinding snow
or the mist and mud of recent days,
you can see it. An ensemble cflights '1
and sparkles, crowned by the mull
faceted symbol of the greatest of
Grinnell's allrcampus parties: the
hallowed Disco Ball. ;

So Grinnellians, heighten your
senses, dust off old clothes, put on,
record, grow some sideburns and an
afro and join us for the ultimate in
college entertainment. March 7th ;
1998 will be a night you won't for-
get (or won‘t be able to remember if
we do our jobs right). It '
begins...Disco IX,
