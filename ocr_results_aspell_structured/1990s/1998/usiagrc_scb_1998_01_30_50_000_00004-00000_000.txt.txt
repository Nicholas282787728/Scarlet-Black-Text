Tales.From Another World Don’t Ask Me, rm Just A Girl

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

Charlie's got some thoughts as to
how‘ it should be, wild unabomber-
like thoughts. Charlie had a vision
while stoned and listening to the
Grateful Dead. He saw rainbows and
people riding on them. Charlie saw
people cut by the rainbows. he saw a
red pool collecting below, Charlie
became disillusioned then and there.
It was the purest truth he had ever
witnessed; Charlie believed it was
the purest truth Ever witnessed.
Charlie has been wary of beautiful
paths ever since.

“It is a harsh world with all paths
leading to suffering. It is a harsh path
to follow life in this world. I had a
vision while stoned showed me
where the rainbow leads.”

Nobody listens to Charlie. He talks
in such a Wild tone. spitting
thoughts, connected and unconv
nected, fused together in a seeming
chain of nonsense broadcast to the
world. But his life is his belief. In
this way Charlie is very naive. He
has yet to adapt to the unknown ex-
periences waiting.

“I have seen the truth, and it is best
for you to accept it."

I have heard talk of one mind, and
one world generating from it. Charlie
likes to tell me my mind doesn‘t
matter.

“This world is my world."

Charlie has no idea about how I
think but he knows that it‘s wrong.
He sees the one path, brutal, rough,
and trying, the inward path to the
perfect soul. He doesn’t believe in
rainbows, he prefers chutes to lad—
ders. To me it looks like he’s getting
weaker, but he claims that in the
separation there is strength.

“The further one is from the manue
factured world the more truth one
will find."

There is a whole world he has yet
to discover, the world of happiness,
and contented pleasure. He doesn‘t

know how that world could possibly
mesh with his, so he instead denies
it, and dlsmisses those who are ofit,
Charlie is a very lonely guy. He is a
sad lonely guy by choice, which is
saddest of all.

Charlie's goal is my goal. We both
seek to rise above; we approach from

different angles, we step wrth differ-

ent strides. Charlie sees my scars and
calls me a failure, he looks at his own
and looks for rewards. Scars from
rainbows and bruises from chutes,
we both refuse the life given for the
life we imagine, we have both aban-
doned earthly safety in hope of heav-
cnly eternity.

“The rainbow, I am the rainbow, I
can show you where the treasure
lies."

Charlie is not a selfish man. He
wants to take us all to greater heights.
hejust wants to be the ﬁrst one there,
with the sign and the cocktails and
the grand welcome.

Charlie is a selfish angel, knowing
his own beauty and keeping it from
the world. His life is a cage of col-
ors, a cage of beauty, bars looming
before him, bars which would melt
with his grasp, but Charlie won't
reach. He sees blades. not bars; he
sees pain, not beauty; he sees the
struggle and not the freedom. Charlie
lives in a teneeting world, collaps-
ing of its own accord.

“Ifit is my world, it is mine to over-
come, in whatever way I wish to
overcome it."

Charlie has these wild thoughts,
thoughts which come from his
mind’s journey, thoughts which
come from living life with those
eyes, and the eyes which have looked
back.‘. Charlie has these wild
thoughts come from a Wild mind in
desperate search of brilliant freedom.
He dreams a different dream for all
that he has seen. He lives a different
life for all the lives he has seen.
Charlie wants to be a beautiful per-
son with the wisdom of all of cre-
ation. We want the same things, he
just prefers chutes to ladders.

I wonder how many angels are
making the same trip, losing their
fellow travelers in the blindness of
their zeal. I wonder if the rainbow is
the many paths and the pain the
grinding of our desire to follow on
different courses.

I wonder why we so desperately
seek something we have never
known.

Well, I'm back and I know that all
of you were wondering how my
break was. my opinions on the Pack—
ers losing the Superbowl, and how
(ofcourse) I'm dealing with the loss
ofComedy Central, El, and VH1 in
my life now that I‘m back in
Grinnell again and without decent
cable. Well, you're in luck because
lcan‘t think of anything else to write
about that pertains to the Grinnell
College community.

My break was uneventful and won-
derful. I want to be back home liv-
ing the lifestyle I quickly became
accustomed to...
noon woke up and spent the hour
staring at my ceiling from my bed
1 p.m. got out ofbed
1:30 pm. watched the Kids In the
Hall and ate breakfast (some people
call it lunch but I live in a different
time zone)

2 p.m. proceeded to watch TV all
day until about seven

7 p.m. rented a movie, usually
Mal/rats or Chasing Amy

8 pm. watched more TV

9 p.m. snacktime

9: 15 p.m. checked my email from my
parents’ computer

10:00 p.m. back to TV for The Daily
Show

ll p.m. watched movie

1 a.m. watched infomercials and
VHl’s Insomniac Music Theatre

3 or A a.m. went to bed

Now I know you‘re thinking I’m sort
of a recluse but please keep in mind
that every time I leftI my house I was
bombarded with Packer merchandis-
ing, Republicans, and fraternity/so
rority children. I will now quote my
friend Joe (who is a new resident of
the city of Milwaukee): “I just don’t
trust any city that has the Packers
headlining all three news channels
every day, regardless of what happens
in other pai‘Ls of the country or local
area.“ Example ieA guy goes crazy
at the Milwaukee post office and
shoots two or three people... but the
Packers just came out with a new
sweatshirt design for their fans!
Example 27 Things are happening
in the Middle East and there’s a threat
of conﬂict... but Green Bay just an-
nounced that Brett Farve was just
heard saying to a friend that he hopes
he wins the Superbowl!
And so forth. And then they beat San
Francisco. I was hoping the 49ers
would win for a number of reasons
It's a prettier place to live, there’s an

ocean, and I really doubt that a quar»
ter of the population drives around

with the stupid flags on their cars,
making them look like members of a
funeral procession. Oh yeah, and last
year someone in San Francisco spray
painted “Sports is the opiate of the
masses" on a subway advertisement
for their football team. I really doubt

that you could ﬁnd intellectual graf-
ﬁti referring to Marx on the bus stop
walls in Milwaukee.

And really, what's the appeal of

sports anyway? I understand the '

appeal of exercise and taking care
of your body and all that stuff. I une
dcrstand sitting around and watch
ing TV and drinking beer. But can
someone please explain to me why
the combination of the‘ two control
the nation to a frightening level?
And why don‘t the fat-ass, been
drinkers feel guilty about watching
athletes in all their glory while
they're on the couch eating pork
rinds and other lardrbased snack
foods? At least ifyou’rejust sitting
around drinking and watching other
TV events (like the Miss America
and Miss Teen America pageants)
you can find pleasure in making fun
of the said event. Whenever I’m
watching football and try to make
fun oftt someone yells at me. The
Pack is Back!” is what he or she
(usually he) will scream. Who the
hell cares? It isn't like their sitting
around on a Sunday or Monday
night will have any influence on the
team Winning or not Winning. The
same can be applied to the purchase
of apparel (though I guess clothes
serve some function to the buyer and
people around the buyer - they show
that the buyer has no taste), ﬂags,
stickers for one’s car, and so forth.
And usually these fans don’t even
have money riding on the game! At
least gambling puts some excitement
into an activity that can be Considr
ered equal to watching grass grow
in the excitement rankings.
