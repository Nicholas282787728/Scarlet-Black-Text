Australia:

Travelers to Australia and the South Pacific may
be exposed to potential diseases from a number of
sources. The most frequently reported illness is
traveler’s diarrhea, but there are other diseases
which are unique to the tropics. This region con»
tains a variety of diseases transmitted by insects,
contaminated food and water, or close contact with
infected people. Specific diseases are discussed
under each of these topical headings. In order to
reduce the risk of infection travelers must (1) pro
tect themselves from insects, (2) ensure the qual-
ity of their food and drinking water, and (3) be
knowledgeable about potential diseases in the re-
gion to be visited. Finally, diseases are not restricted
to cleanly defined geographical areas, i.e. mosqui-
toes can ﬂy over city or country borders, therefore,
all travelers should protect themselves by taking
the basic preventive precautions.

Arctic Ocean:

The centerpiece of the Circumpolar North, its bor-
derin g lands include those of Alaska, Canada,
Greenland/Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, and Russia. Throughout this immense area,
economic developers search for oil, gas, zinc, sil-
ver, coal, and similar marketable products. In
Alaska, especially, a major problem restricting this
development is land withdrawal . millions of acres
having been set aside for national or regional parks,
military reserves, forests, wildlife refuges, and wil-
derness areas.

Cyprus:

Historians believe that as far back as 280 BC. there
was a town called Ledra in the center of Cyprus.
Then follows a gap in history for more than a thou-
sand years, when it is recorded that a walled city
stood in the Mcsaoria plain and its name was
Lefkosa or Lefkosia. The modem name of Nicosia,
arose in the 19th century when an English soldier
corrupted the word, because he did not listen care-
fully to the inhabitants’ pronunciation (so the story
goes). However, the name Nicosia was used in the
Middle Ages.

Students Protest Inaction at Grinnell
“There aren t enough protests on this campus”

BY SCAREY SPICE
Centerfold of the Month

This past Sunday thousands of Grinnell
College‘s students staged a protest over
the lack of protests over the last few years.

People for miles around could hear the
chants of “We Are Not Content" until the
early hours of Monday morning. Accord-
ing to a number of students interviewed.
this feeling of discontent had been brew—
ing for a number of months before the
protest was actually initiated. For others
this realization only dawned over Spring
Break. One south campus resident hip—
pie remarked “Yeah man... I only realized
how dismal my life was after a near death
experience while tripping in the moun-
tains of Utah a few days ago... Plus I re-
alized that Widespread Panic sucked
when I ran out of drugs at one of their
concerts," Another hippie standing next
to him then replied " Yeah man... I only
realized that my life was full of a series
of random meaningless events after I
learned Rick James was a crackhead for
over twelve years on a VH1 special....
Mary Jane was all a lie!”

North campus residents also joined in
the angry protest Sunday. One slightly

confused looking young jock expressed
his anger at the general apathetic atmo»
sphere on campus, “We never do anything
around here... there are so many problems
facing the world right now and all we do
is sit in our rooms and study... Hey, do
you know where the keg is?"

Others in higher up positions had also
been concerned that Gnnnell’s strong tra-

dition of protest had been waning over the
past several years. One anonymous
trustee member revealed the board’s se-
cret plan to the Scarlet and Black. “We
were growing concemed over the lack of
protest on campus. We devised a scheme
about ﬁve years ago to address this prob-
lem. We thought that if we continually

Pee Wee Herman to replace Ferguson
as next president of Grinne'II College

BY COURTESY CAROL
Phat As A Barrel

After months of leaderless drifting,

Grinnell College has ﬁnally acquired a

i new president. In a statement issued
Thursday, the Board of Tmstees announce
that it had interviewed thousands of ap-
plicants, but none stood out more than Pee
Wee Herman.

“Pee Wee lured us into his world of
fun and excitement, and left us disap-
pointed whcn we had to leave and go back
to cm hackneyed lifestyle," said President
ofthe Board ofTrustees Caroline Smalls.
“I feel that bringing him to Grinnell will
help to renew some of the spark that has
left the campus in recent years.”

In a speech to the campus earlier to-
day. Pee Wee outlined a few plans for his
tenure at the college.

He intends to ﬁght against crank abuse
in the town, he said. “I know what it’s
like you have your bike stolen,” said
President Herman, “and we shouldn't
have drugs that make people steal bikes."

Pee Wee also announced a plan to im
stitute a vocabulary enhancing program
he called Word Of The Day. “Today’s
word is Swashbuckler," said Pee Wee. At
that point, the presentation degraded as
Pee Wee and onlookers began to scream
real loud.

Pee Wee has followed in the shoes of

other great leaders such as Boris Yeltsin .

by ﬁring his entire staff. The new admin—
istration of Grinnell College will include
a talking globe named Globey. a talking
chair named Chairey, a disembodied ge-
nie head named Jambi, and “a whole gang
of cool friends," President Herman said.

Pteri Smith ‘99. “He has done a lot to
gain recognition for people in my ethnic
group.”

Other students crted hls spiffy bow tie,
his long time friendship Wlth kd lang, and
his ability l0 fly as reasons to welcome
Pee Wee into the Grinnell community”

Not everybody is happy about Presl—
dent Pee Wee’s appointment, however.

Alluding to an incident several years
ago when Pee Wee was caught unzipped
during the airing of a pornographic ﬁlm,
an anonymous sophomore complained,
“He’s a sick perverted lunatic who
oughtn't to be roaming the streets, let
alone running a college."

Pee Wee put all worries to rest. how-
ever, when he answered allegations by
stating, “I know you are, but what am I?”

College and City at Odds Over Ownership of Norris Hall

BY YOUR MOM
I’m won-led about you

The City of Grinnell has announced
plans to seize ownership of the College's
Norris Hall and turn the building into a
low-income housing project.

”Technically speaking, that building is
just too ugly to meet the city Code," said
mayor Bill Pendt, ‘

“No one seems to want tO go near that
end of the College," added city building
inspector John Kammer. “We thought we
might as well tum it into the projects."

The city plan includes minorrefurbish-
ments to the interior of the building and
the erection ofa twenty-foot high cement
wall around Norris “so fewer people will
have to see it," Pcndtexplained. They will
begin to move in tenants as soon as late
May, when current occupants will be
evicted.

Grinnell College plans to fight the

'city‘s action, and has ﬁled a petition for a

moratorium on the seizure in district
court.

“Norris Hall is perfectly functional, "
commented acting College president
Chuck Wayne, “n has had no majorstruc-
rural or maintenance problems since it
was built, and besides, college students
can’t afford to have aesthetic standards.
We have the money, and we make those
decisions for our students.”

Student and stztll reactions to the pro-
posit] are mixed.

“I‘d be a little sorry to see it go, since
my friends and I bond over living in such
a hellholc," said Norris rcsldcnt Sarah
Parker ‘01. “But Norris is just so damn
ugly,"

Another anonymous studentscemed to
support city allegatlons when he said.
“Norris’.I Man, I don't even go around
that neighborhood. I get claustrophobic
in the halls."

A college custodian who also wished
to remain anonymous agreed, saying,
“You can’t fit a human and a vacuum
cleaner next to each other in the hallways,
and people I know are always telling sto»
ries about feeling the need to take a
shower after having been in Norris lounge
for too long."

Other students mourned the proposed
passing ofthe dormitory into city hands.
“It felt like home to me," said alumnus
Raul Felson ‘97. “I treated that building
with all the care and respect that I would
have given my own pad."

“I’ve had a lot offun in Norris," added
Jeff Rickschiester ‘99. “Woooo, those
were some crazy, wet times. Those bas-
tards can take Norris away, but they can’t
take my memory... lapses of Norris away
from me,“

The preliminary hearing on the own-
ership to rights to Norris Hall is set for
Friday, April 17 at 10 am.

campus would become riled up... we are

Gum gets good
Editor's: “Putting out

shoddy work just
wasn’t fun anymore”

BY HERBERT KORNFELD
Accounts Receivable Supervisor

In a bold move hearkening back to
such classic moments as the interview
with the loop scoopers and Alex Cohen
jokes, the GUM has released a good is-
sue.

“Our magazine has sucked for a
couple of years now. so we thought, what
the hey,” commented GUM co-editot
Mark Moron ‘99.

Some of the GUM‘s problems with
putting together a well-received issue
may not simply be due to lack of will or
time, but may stem from a curse appar-
ently put upon their efforts by a former
editor. “I was a heathen when I did the »
GUM," said 199596 editor Andy
“Little” Kropa ‘98, “but now I’ve found
God, and I cast the wrath of the Lord
upon those despicable sinners who are
the current editors."

Cerditor Chris Fiddler ‘98 also cited
lack of submissions as a cause of the
GU'M’s recent troubles. “Nobody ever
sends us anything and we can‘t ﬁgure out
why," Fiddler moaned. “It's gotten so
bad that we have to dedicate anywhere
from four to eight pages an issue to beg-
ging for submissions. We’ve run out of
S & Bjokes, and wejust can’tcreate this
monster on our own!"

Despite these pressing troubles, fa-
mous debacles including last year‘s ASIA
spoof have prompted the miraculous
transformation of the GUM from strug-
gling “Magazine of,..Civilized Dis-
course" to brilliant comedic vehicle.

Scores of formerly disgruntled stu-
dents greeted the GUM's new strategy
with heartfelt appreciation. “Those
punks have been taking my student ac-
tivities fee and printing crap for too
long," said James Mitchell ‘99, “Some
heads were about to roll,"

Hope Jackson ‘01 agreed, “Well, you
know, I really think we should accept
everyone for who they are and all learn
to live together peacefully, and I’m sure
they were trying really hard, but, well, it
wasn’t that good. I’m so glad they fl-
nally found the light and turned it on."
she said.

A small minority of readers expressed
continued dismay at the recent GUM
developments, however. “They still
haven't mentioned my name for at least
a year," said angered alumnus Alex
Cohen ‘96. “And there just isn’t any-
thing quite as good as my drinking games
article showing up in the GUM. How
can Fiddler and Moron carry on the proud
tradition without me?“
