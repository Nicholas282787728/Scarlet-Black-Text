Jazz Joint—

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

So now, a month after the crisis,
we sit around without thoughts of
war. We think about the coming

, spring. We think about graduation
and the promise ofthe future, What
scares us most is losing our insur~
anec, and the thought that so many
of these goodbyes are permanent.
But what has changed in this
month? One month ago on this cam-
pus there was passion on both sides
ofthe issue, bomb Saddam, ban the
bomb, and now the issue has slipped
from our social consciousness. It is
noton the news, itis notin the head-
lines, so it is no longer our worry.
But what has changed? How could
people think that it was right to kill
thousands of Iraqis then and now
believe that all is well?As citizens,
did they feel it was their responsi-

~ bility to play political hardball wlth
Saddam the same as Americans in
the 50's felt it was their Individual
responsibility to keep the Russians"
at bay? Why do so many people ﬁnd
it necessary to justify their
government’s actions? We live in
corrupt times. We are ruled by core
rupt leaders. Just because charges
are dropped against the president
does not mean he is in good moral
standing. Just because the Ameri»
can government admitted its wrong
doing in such atrocities as the
Tuskegee experiment does not
mean they are not committing the

same atrocities today. All we have .

tojudge the government by is what

they have admitted to, and every ﬁfty
years they admit to an atrocity of the
past. Atrocities which would never be
accepted at the tttne they are commit-'
ted are accepted in the future because
of the gains we have taken from the
pains we ltave caused. We admit the
atrocities, we admit our mistakes, but
there is no way to rectify our wrongs
and so we make grand apologies from
ornate presidential podiums and we
hold tight to our wealth and all we
have gained, and the cycle repeats it-
self; these atrocities are no doubt on-
going.

We are so easily swayed by the
words of authority. We bend at their
will, like trees to the wind, only we
are not so deeply rooted. And when
the pushing stops and we spring up-
right we find ourselves farther away
from where we need to be. The more
we tolerate the threat of meaningless
war, the more we tolerate the abuses
of power, the more we tolerate social
conventions which destroy social well
being, the more helpless we will be
to right ourselves when we ﬁnd our
selves a fallen race.

So now it is time to determine righe
teousness. Now is the time to examv
inc the steps we are taking, and the
direction we are moving. Now is the
time to determine who is moving us
in that direction, What force is deter
mining our future? Are we traveling
there consciously, or are we being
pushed?

It is a difﬁcult thing to be your own
person in a country of such strong
will. But it is an awful thing to be
someone else‘s tool in the destruction
of the earth. This country does not
want to let us go. Individual freedom
does not help a war machine, nor a
money machine. Ahigher Conscious
ness among its citizens is detrimen—
tal to the goals of an imperialist, ex-
pansionist government. It is our re-
sponsibility to be a detriment. It is the
duty of a righteous person to stand in
the way of the path America is tak-

mg.

Well, I’m Trying to Learn Your Language

On the precarious position of being
a senior

”It’s rough, baby, to live. And it's
hard, baby, to survive. Every day
lately, my mind feels like glass wait-
ing to be smashed." —SMOG

IfI have to spend another minute
in this lunatic bin I Will get crazier
than all of you. If] have to run to
the post ofﬁce, visit the treasurer or
get another signature from my ad»
visor, I’ll lose it. I get delirious
tremors in the library and the shakes
in the publications building. I am
dehydrating slowly, gaining weight
and watching my hair become limp
and greasy. I am eating too much
saturated fat. My bean is failing.

My brain is going soft. My apart-
ment is a pigsty and I have no in-
tention ofcleamngit up I am wear-
mg big, stupid band itshms for like
ﬁve days straight. I am not drink-
ing or partying enough. I keep
changing my plan. The situation of
my mental and physical health is
immediate and grave. Doctors say
it's time to get the hell out of this
place. Iagree. That goes for you
too.

Too much ofa good thing is aw-
fully bad for you. Too much of a
bad thingiseven worse. Sometimes
Grinnell seems like one of those
kind of mediocre things. And me-
diocrity can kill you. Any way you
slice it, more than enough is too
much. I got a little bored with

Grinnell after a year and then sick of
it after that and then really cynical
after that and now I live offecampus

and can’t help butscowl at people who '

look like they‘re having innocent ftin.
Four years. 1/4 of my life. That‘s so
so long. So long.

Is that the way it’s supposed to be?
Is Grinnell trying to do this to us? I
don‘t have the cynicism to ﬁnd that
so. I think that the root of this prob-
lem is our obsession with the liberal
arts degree. I was already a libertar»
ian artist when I started school here.
I don‘t need an embossed piece of
paper to prove it. I needed to go to
college after high school because I
was a baby and did not know what
else to do for myself (thank the sub-
urbs for that one). I propose a new
system at this ﬁne big-name institur
tion. You saw it coming: THE
GRINNELL COLLEGE ASSO»
CIATE'S DEGREE.

Grinnell College, I like you for two
years. It looks good and wears well.
After two years packed with classes I
actually enjoy instead of four years of
endless dribble about such topics as
“statistics” or “syntax,” I will feel re—
ally good. I will get the same nice
slip of embossed paper at the end,
except I will be an associate instead
of a bachelor. You tell me which one
sounds more professional to potential
employers. And I’ll be smarter cause
I won't have to drink away my bore-
dom with “too much ofa good thing."

Don't tell me I'm not making sense.
I KNOW I'm not making sense and I
have no intention to start until I get
out of here. I can no longer process
or convey useful infon'nation. “But,
Ali, why?"

I have been here for almost every bit
of four years. I am Grinnell. I am
statistics and syntax. I am a black
robe. lam a big kid. I am smarter. I
am more prepared for the “Real
World." I am SQC I-IZO! I am the
Viewbook! The Zirkle! Gates Tower
on the front of the student handbook!
I am the 5&B! Burling Fourth! A
keg!

—I am an entry in the ’98 section of
the Alumni directory. Are you happy?
Now give me my damn slip of paper.
And I want it signed. So long.

Don’t Ask Me I’M Just A Girl Strappin’ 0n the Feed Bag

BY Ltzz WESTMAN
Campus Cynic

Dear Lizz,

I hate Grinnell. I want to go home.
I know I only have a few weeks left,
but this place is sheer and utter hell.
Each of my professors seems to think
I’m only taking four credits, what-
ever they are teaching. The dining
hall is trying to poison me A I‘ve lost
20 pounds since I got to college! My
roommate wakes me up at five in the
morning every day when she goes
jogging . She won‘t even let me
smoke in the room, the evil bitch, I
miss my dog too, Grinnell sucks. I
should have gone to my state school
with all my friends from high school.
rYet Another Goddamn First Year
Dear First Year, .

Yup. last yearl mad outside the
forum and told a group of
prospective: not to come here. You
didn 'r listen. Ha Ha. -L

Dear LizZ,

I’m going to graduate soon. What
should I do with my life'.l
-Frightened on First Ave,

Dear Frightened.

Well, considering a liberal artr de-
gree int 'i worth jack rhiz anymore, 1
suggest you sell babies on the black
market. You should also consider
buying beer and cigarettes for high
school students, provided with a hefty
"tax" ofcourre. Oh, and be sure [0

Letters
— to the editor

To the Grinnell College Community:

I have two reasons for writing this
letter. I would like to present a note
ofencouragement and ask for appli-
cations for positions on next year's
cabinet.

I have a few desires. I hope that
Grinnell continues to be the ﬁne in—
stitution that all of us have chosen to
be apart of. My hope is that Grinnell
succeeds at being a school that nur-
tures without becoming a-haven.
Each community member‘s decision
to act with responsibility, on an inn
dividual and group level, will lead
to positive experiences.

Applications for cabinet are avail-
able in the SGA ofﬁce and are due
Saturday, April II by 5 PM (that’s
probably tomorrow). I, and I think I
can speak for Jessica Dvorak in this
instance, am eager to staff cabinet

numbers offarmer Grinnellialls so
that you '11 have references in use
along yburclbnb {oi/1210p. Alumni
have Connections, they might even
get you in with one a/the lop care
leis! -L,

Dear Lizz,

I'm a poor, white, Republican male
that can’t even beat or belittle my
girlfriend in public without some
Fascist hippy liberal jumping down
my throat. I'll be lucky lfI can even
get a job when I graduate. I’m the
new minority, damnit. and I demand
respect. I'm sick of people on this
campus wluning about things like the
price of food when they should be
starting underground fraternities and
sororities to help further the spread
of conservatism across Mat: Field. 1
get to be the leader! I’ll direct the
victory march as Grinnell moves toe
wards the glory of schools like
Dartmouth, Colgate, and Penn.
rStupld North Campus Sophomore
Dear Dan,

I’m so glad that you wrote me :2
because I was llttllally going to Write
a response‘io last week Li letter to the
editor. As a whiny, lib ml, mart-hal-
t'ng. vegetarian feminist, I was ini-
tially oﬂ'eltded by your Comments.
However, after some consideration
and a few episodes bfihe 700 Club,
I realized that you are 100% correct.
You are the smartest. molest, mosl
right-an kind ofguy [have cvcrnconi
of. [gave up all my crazy thought:
about having a career or u person-
ality so that I can be exactly how
nature intended: barefoot, docile,
pregnant, and cooking in the kitchen

free reign overall important matters
in my life from how I look to when I
can speak in public. 11’: easier that
way for both of us. From your
webpagc I learned that you like to

Well, I happen to look like I'mﬁf-
teen, Want to go out? -L.

Note To Prospectives: Don’t Come
Here.

with trustworthy, honest, and re-
speclful people. Ihope that when the
people of Grinnell look to the stu-
dent government asso 'ation with
their concerns and ini atives they
ﬁnd a group of people who are ready
to listen, respond, and produce. If
you are excited about the prospect
of working hard and seeking accome
plishment I strongly encourage you

to apply.

REBECCA EILERS
Food Critics

If we were to sum up Dari Bam's
meal selection in a single word, it
would be this: pork. Ifwe could char-
acterize it in a phrase, it would be
this: pork pork pork. Rebecca pro-
tested this description, noting that
“pork pork pork” was not technically
a phrase, since a phrase suggests that
the words make sense together. So
Erin rephrased: “a pork is a pork is a
pork." Rebecca congratulated Erin
on creating an independent clause.

However, we digress. The pork op- -

lions were endless, although every
option was served on a bun. (We
asked for a pork shake, but we were
denied, and told that pork was NOT
a topping. We got huffy, and told
them we were vegans, anyway.)
Ground pork, shredded pork, pork
jerky, pork fritters, pork succotash,
pork gumbo, pork eggrolls, and
chicken fried pork: who could ask for
anything more?

Although the post-meal recovery
time was signiﬁcantly longer than
that ofDairy Queen, we thoughtthis
was counteracted by their menu item
nomenclature. No matter what the
taste, who can argue with the delec—
table-sounding “jerkwich?” Know»
ing that Erin had stayed in Grinnell
last summer, Rebecca wondered if
Erin had been the inspiration for this
new sandwich. Erin was speechless.
And that's a rarity.

Similarly, Dan' Barn doesn't serve
mere ”ground meat.” No, it serves
the exotic “Guinea Grinder." But, we
wondered, was it exotic because of
the locale from which it originated,
or was it exotic because it was an
ACTUAL GUINEA PIG'.l We did
not ﬁnd out the answer to that ques-
tion, although Dave Brott noted that
it is only our social conventions that
keep us from eating certain domes-
ticated animals such as guinea pigs,
dogs, and cats. Nonetheless, Dave
explained to us that ”it's wrong to
eat dogs. It’s okay to eat cats,
though." He quickly agreed to order

a cat burger if it ever appears on the
menu.

Another menu item with a name
that prompted us to sample it was the
“BBQ Whole Hog." We were disap»
pointed that it was not, in fact, a
whole hog. Either that or they have
only mutant hogs in the shape of
shreds. Even ifthe shreds on our bun
did not make a whole hog, we‘re
pretty sure there were a few nomadic
hogs roaming the kitchen. We as-
sumed they had to slaughter them in
the back, since it took several days-—
or at least a half hour— for our meal
to arrive.

Erin did not enjoy her marshmal-
low malt. She found this surprising,
despite the fact that she ﬁnds marsh-
mallows abhorrent. Instead. she
found it necessary to consume 94.3
percent of Rebecca‘s chunky peach
shake. “The peach chunks kept get—
u’n g stuck in the gol dang straw," said
Rebecca, who had given up swear
ing for Lent. “Golly geejinkies," she
added, “I can hardly wait for Easter."
Rebecca proclaimed herself the
champion sucker by the end of the
meal.. Erin agreed.

Although'we were too overloaded
with grease to try the dessert menu,
we definitely felt the sweet corn
nuggests were needed to end the
meal. We were giddy to the max to
try them since they seemed to be the
treat that only an Iowan could love.
In fact, this was a lie, since Rebecca,
the Iowan, thought they tasted, in her
words, “like schmack." Wait. Those
were Erin's words. We found them
fascinating. Our question: How does
one bread creamed corn? And who
was the mastermind who conceptu-
alized them in the ﬁrst place? Erin
hopes to get a summer grant to re-

. search the mystery. Rebecca wanted

to warn our reading audience of four
that they are strangely addictive.

In conclusion, we could not decide
if Dari Barn or Dairy Queen was the
superior restaurant, but this was only
because we refused to agree with one
another on principle. So, when in
doubt, starve.
