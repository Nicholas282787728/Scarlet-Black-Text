Funny Girl &

Directed by William Wyler. Stars

I had a little bit of trouble watch»
ing this movie. My view was ob»
scured during most of the movie by
Barbara Streisand's huge ego. Even
when the movie was visible, how-

ever, it was a problem. I know many
many people who like this movie, but
I don't understand why. I think these
friends of mine should be locked up
and have their taste in movies per~
manently incinerated, This movie is
boring. Boring boring boring. And i
don't just say this because it lacks
guns and explosions (see my flam-
ing review ofTomarrorv Neveroies

for evidence). It contains boring
characters that I didn't end up citr-
ing about at all anywhere during this
movie. Tlicn Barbara siarts singing
and youjust wish there were a fast-
forwztrd option available during the
movie. Plus ii's really long, a pre.
1970 Hollywood musical epic. Plus
it’s rated G. Plus it’s showing Friday
night at 8‘30. You should be out
drinking-and acting stupid instead of
watching this moVie.

James Bond needs to quit. The
industry has been making money
hand over ﬁst with this character, but
lsadly, the pioi has largely remained
the same throughout. Shameless.
This installment features even
dumber dialogue and unexeiting
stunts. A lot ofcxplosions, but almost
no hean. Don't watch this moVie. No,

Have you ever toned meot? Enough said, fyou were there, you know what I‘m talking about. After that little
quip, we began to hear the words...they cor ed on throughout the event. "Show some more 0%!”

Ellery Frohm '99, who will chair the event ext yeor, commented that ”there were complaints about the time
limit enlorcement...yes, the time limit was s pposedly 5 minutes." if you were there, you know what l'm talking
about.

‘Yes, some movies were six or seven mi les long,” Frohm mentioned. "Yes, we disqualified ’Clossic Corwosh
'Freoks‘ and the vegan movie...” Why? "B cause they were 12 t'cking minutes long,” he added. ”That's why we

owed them during the intermissions.”

”Put, the Gay Bicycle,” Frohm placed second with ”Evolution” and "Ego Powers“ won third
place... In addition to the winners, Frohm mentioned 0 few of his favorites, which included ”IRA College Grodu-
ate", ”Lo Amore Geometric", “Self Governance", ond ”Loundry Room."

Pot, the Guy Bicycle, as you could hopefullyfigure out by the title, was the story of o troubled bike named Pat;
a homosexual in a world full ofheterosexuol, goyrboshing bikes, The rogue bikes screamed insults at him: ”get
off the road you queer bikel' Other bikes threw bottles at him.

So Potdecided to iourney to the big city. All by himself. And he found Chris, another gov bicycle. The two then
created a life for themselves, and lived hoppily ever ofter.

Evolution took a historical biological principle and twisted it in cl new direction. As the comero panned across
the scenic and pristine Grinnell compus, something suddenly chonged, The squirrels weren’t behaving the
some, Something was wrong. The numerous green electric company converter boxes begun to grow legs and
walk around. They were growing in numbers...they were migroting.,.to the metol sculpture near the science
building. An evolution.,,of sorts. ‘

Icon still here the crowd yelling..."We wont to see some more 03$!" Domn college kids.

Ego Powers involved a crowd of crazy kids chosing another, even loonier leoder ocross compus Initiolly
small in numbers, the following began to grow. They stopped to dance and groove, and the took off in some
random direction, only to do it again later,

Afew ofthe other interesting ﬁlms included, as Frohm mentioned, Laundry Room, or ”IR”, 05 the introduction
creatively stated. it was the horrible story of o Grinnell student stranded in the Younker laundry room with his
only chip stuck hopelessly in a machine already going through its cycle.

IRA College Groduote portrayed o lone Grinnell student taking some time alone in the woods to rellect upon
life and its meaning. Taking 0 walk, he suddenly finds himself being chased by 0 humanoid beost, shaggy and
repulsive. After 0 Chase and a brief, ensuing struggle, the Wild beost glances to the student’s Grinnell College t
shirt and recalls how he graduated from the some school not too long before, So that's whclt happens to oil of
the Grinnell grads! .

This year's Tltulor Head was a mix of weird and sometimes very long movtes with loud heckling and o few
people even getting removed at the end.

Frohm’s words of advice for next year? "Edit, edit, edit. make your movie short and sweet, like the Winners this
yeor.~ w

Whether you held fun or not, you have to admit that it was indeed interesting. Many students spent a great
deal of time and energy making their films, which certainly needs to be acknowledged

Frohm mentioned that he would ”welcome any constructive Input as to how ‘ﬁtulor Heod can be improved for
next year,” so if you have on idea, feel free to let him know, Numerous improvements ore olreody plonned for
next year, including the possibility of "o brighter video protector,” and ”large concert speakers."

Maybe then the sound ol'show us some more 035$!" won’t be as loud. But it was good for o lough.

Starring Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jack-
son, Robert De Niro, Robert Forster,
Bridget Fonda

Jackie Brown is a pretty good
movie for one particular reason: the
age of the stars. This movie has aplot
which takes too long to develop and
makes the movie slow, but it show»
cases Pam Grier and Robert Forster
as old people doing cool things while
they kind ofsort of fall for eachother.
Plus. Tarantino can write dialogue.
Watch for Robert De Niro smoking
pot, and see ifit reminds you of any
of your friends. On the other hand, it
is really long, andcanbedutiin pans.

senior recitalists

Underground Quartet and Jazz
Trio to accompany Jager, Me'nsah.

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Katharine iager ‘93. Nana
Mensah ‘98, and Amy Kucera ‘98
will present their senior recitals on
April 18, 19, and 24, respectively,
in Herrick Chapel. All three have
done extensive work in the Music
Departmeni,'although Kueera is the
only Music major.

Katharine lager. soprano, will
present her recital at 2 pm. on Sate
urday, April 18 in Herrick Chapel.
She will be accompanied by John
Christian Rommereim on piano.
J ager’s selections encompass every-
thing from 12th century German
chant to Broadway composer
Stephen Sondheim. At various times
she will be joined onstage by Cody
Robertson ‘00, cello, and the Under-
ground Quartet.

The Underground Quartet will
accompany lager on analdi aria
that she discovered through the
movie Shine. Jager points out that
this aria is especially notable because
“it was written for a Woman [when]
most soprano music of that time was
written for boys and men."

Althoughlageris an Englishman
jor with a concentration in Gender
and Women‘s Studies, she has been
taking Voice lessons for all four of
her years at Grinnell. In addition, she
has been in the Grinnell Singers for
four years, and is President this year.

Jager began formal singing when
she was 9, and she quipped, “I don’t
know if I can stop now." Jager den
scribed the role of music in her life:
“My primary form of expression is
in poetry, but music and vocal mus
sic is related to that...it’ exercises a
different part of my creativity."

Nana Mensah, soprano, will
present her recital at 7 pm on Sun
day, April 19 in Herrick Chapel.
Among her selections are the tradi-
tional “Music for awhile,“ a gospel
ﬂavored “Amazing Grace," and
”Blue,” which she-co»eomposed.
She Will be accompanied by John
Christian Rommereim, piano; Jeff
Tyner ‘99, classical guitar; Nathan
Germick ‘98. piano; and The Jazz
Trio.

The Jazz Trio, comprised ofChris
Petersen ‘00, piano; Paul Chaikin
‘01 . bass; and Rob Felty ‘01, drums,
will accompany Mensah on three
contemporary pieces, “Don’t Ge't
Around Much Anymore,” “My

Funny Valentine," and “The Lady is
a Tramp."

“Blue" is a piece that Mensah
composed with Gemilck about Sadr
ness, Although the lyrics have gone
through a change, the song still cars
rics its original meaning. Mensah
will be accompanied by Gemiick on
the piano for this piece.

Mensah, a Biology major, has
studied voice with Lisa Henderson
for’two years, sang with Grinnell
Singers for three semesters, and
Young, Gifted, and Black for two se-
mesters. She is also currently intem-
ing at a recording studio.

About singing Mensah said, “It’s
a way that I can express myself that
I can't when I’m speaking...it's a
place where you can express deep
emotions with a lot of people."

Amy Kucera will present her re-
cital at 4:30 pm on Friday, April 24
at Herrick Chapel. She will perform
three original pieces, “Two of Me,"
“Iona," and “The Sound Room.”

“The Sound Room," according to
Kueera, “describes how sound is al-
ways around us...you can never be
in a place where there is complete
silence." The Ritalin Test Squad will
join Kueera on-stage, performing a
classroom scene. Amidst the may
hem Kucera will recite a short story.
She says that ‘The Sound Room" ”is
venturing a little into performance
art." ,

In her two other pieces, Kucera
explores different aspects of elec-
tronic music, such as a computer pro»
gram which can be instructed to re
spond to certain pieces of informa~
tion, allowing Kueera “to have ajam
session with the computer,“ as she
described it.

Kueera, a music major, has stud
ied piano and voice, and has been a
part of the Grinnell Singers for three
years. Last year, Kucera was
awarded the Hill Award for vocal
performance, and was also awarded
first and second prizes in the Steiner
Competition‘for her compositions in ' ‘
choral and electronic fnusic. Last
semester she interned with the Scots
tish Music Information Centre work»
ing with digital audio.

Next year Kucera plans to take a
year off, and devote time to “writing
a lot ofmore traditional music." One
of the pieces she plans to work on is
for the Grinnell Orchestra, hopefully
to be played at the dedication of the
new Fine Arts building. '
