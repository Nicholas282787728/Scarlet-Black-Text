Poweshiek voters aid Vilsack vicMy

Incumbents roll to re- e-Iection

Poweshiek County voters retumed
incumbents to office Tuesday and
helped elect Iowa‘s ﬁrst Democratic
govemor in 30 years.

Two local lawmakers, Democratic
state Sen. Dennis Black and Repub-
lican state Rep. Danny Carroll, won
new legislative terms, and U.S, Rep.
Leonard Boswell, the lone Democrat
in the Iowa congressional delega-
tion, was elected to his second term
In the House.

The stunner or-the evening, of
course, was state Sen. Tom Vilsack's
election to the governorship. The
Mount Pleasant Democrat, who was
behind by some 20 percentage points
in the Iowa Poll only three weeks
ago, dashed the hopes offormerCon-
gressman Jim Ross Lightfoot, the
Republican who two years ago lost a
bid to unseat U. S. Sen Tom Harkin.

Vilsack wins county

Here in Poweshiek County, Vil-
sack out-polled Lightfoot by 3,311
votes to 3,126. Vilsack can'ied three
of Grinnell's four wards, losing to
Lightfoot only in the city’s Fourth
Ward.

Boswell who had been targeted
nationally by Republicans who
thought the ﬁrst term co‘ngressman
was Vulnerable, had little difﬁculty
in beating back the challenge ofstate
Sen. Larry McKibbcn, a Mar-

shalltown Republican Boswell car-.

ried Poweshiek County, 3, 415 to
2, 662.

To no one s surprise, incumbent
US. Sen. Charles Grassley won a

Could it be that a certain group of
young people at Grinnell High School
who call themselves the Deadhead Fan
Club are at least partially responsible
for the football team’s victorious sea-
son?

Members of the group, who occupy
a certain area of the stadium at each
game and who stand throughout the
game, claim theirpurpose is to support
the team and to prove it each member
of the group wears an orange T shirt
with the name and number ofa mem-
ber of the team on the back and
"kicks. with an arrow pointing
downward, The remainder ofthis ofﬁ-
cial costume may or may not include a
pair of camouﬂage pants.

Whatever they’ve done, it's with a
good-natured sense of humor and it

must have helped.

The storytelling classes last week at
Grinnell High School brought out tales
of nostalgia, high jinks (including
Burdettc Ford's told to his grandson
Aaron Phipps) and other stunts for the
oldsters to pass on to the youngsters
but the most lurid tales may have been
the one told by Mark Kolpin’s surr0e
gate grandparent, actually his great
uncle Bill Klotz, now ofAnkeny, who
spent much of his life in Cicero, 111:,
also the home of the Capone family,
one ofwhom was named Al (yes, that
Al).

Klotz’s story as retold by Kolpin: 1i
seemsthat in hisyouth Klotzdclivcrcd
newspapers and on one unfortunate
day misscd as he tossed one on the
Capone porch, only to break a win-
dow. Girding his loins, he went to the
door to confess his Sin, only to be
invited inside and treated to refresh-
merits and nickcls to play pool. After
losing all his nickels he prepared to
leave and was rewarded With a SIObill
andthcadnionitionnottoiellwhere he
had been or where he got the money.

Take it or leave it!

Asusual,tthiwanispancakebreak-

community party.

Around may have arrived too late to
seeanyhunlers forwhomthebrcakfast

day of the pheasant—hunting season,
but the upper level of the Veterans
Memorial Building was full of neigh-
borly chatting.

And Around learned a tip from the
Pancake Man: The correct way to tell
when a pancake is ready to turn. Don’t
count the bubbles on the top of the first
side because by then it's too late, In-
stead, watch until the sides begin to
“suck in." THAT's the time to ﬂip the
pancake over for the perfect result.

Around was captivated Sunday by
the reverberating honking of geese,
that echoing sound that signals the end
offal] and the advent ofwinter. [t was
raucous and persistent, but where were
the geese?

The honking continued but a careful
scan of theladen sky revealedno sighte
ofthc birds.

Disappointed not to view the pic-
turesque v shape ofthe ﬂying birds or
possibly more than one v shape ifthc
flock was large, Around gave up the
sighting, only to realize that the clouds
must be so low that the geese actually
were ﬂying above them and out of
sight.

Growingupcnthcshorcsoi‘alakeas
Around did, the semirannua] ritual of
multitudes ofﬂocks that visited spring
and fall in awe-inspiring numbers on
their way north or south was a rite of
passage not to be missed.

So naturally, the persistent honking
of the invisible ﬂocks on Sunday
brought with it a certain amount of
nostalgia.

’virtual trade mission’

Students in Mike Baker's economics
class at Grinncll High School offered
some solutions to export challenges
they researched on thc Internet as part
ofa “virtual trade mission."

The presentation took place Thurs-
day in thc high school’s media center,
and it was attended by several invited
guests, including school and city oi‘ﬁ»
cials, local busmess people and mem»
bers ofthe Junior Achievement Board.

Baker described the forum as “a
chance for the siudents to display what
they have learned about obstacles and
opportunities that Iowa-related busir
nesses encounter now and in the fur
ture."

Kathy slary, president of Grinnell
Junior Achievement, said Iowa Is one

Iowans opt for change,
send Vilsack to D.M.

Toward the end ofthe campaign, you could sense It: what once seemed
highly unlikely was about to become a reality. Jim Ross Lightfoot, soaring
along over the summer and into the fall, with buoyant poll numbers propel-
ling him, was in trouble. His margin was shrinking daily, with Tom Vilsack
closmg fast. And when 9 p.1n.rollct1arouiid and election ofﬁcials began
counting the numbers, Vilsack had achieved the impossible. In many ways it
was a breathtaking achievement. Vilsack, the state senator and former mayor
of Mt. Pleasant, suddenly had become the ﬁrst Democrat elected governor of

Iowa in 30 years,

How did it Itappcn‘,7 There were
several reasons. we suspect. One
was complacency on the part ofthc
Lightt‘oot campaign, The former
GOP congressman sometimes acted

- as though he didn't rcnlly have to

bothcr with the tedious nuts and
bolts of campaigning 7 that the
govcrilorslilp was somehow his due.
And Ihcli there was all the negative
campaigning, Some ofihat was to
be expected, buI nglitl'ooi's TV

spots were particularly odious, But perhaps the most signiﬁcant element was
Vilsack's tenacity. Oncc scorhcd for solnc carly mistakes, and then sccm-
ingly ignored, he worked lnrdcr each day and ﬁnally got his message across

Now comes the hard part. lowans have chosen to have a divided govemr
ment once again. While Democrats will occupy Tendcc Hill and domltiutc
the Executive Council (they‘ll llold Ihc stutcwidc olliccs ofsccrclary oisihic,
state treasurer, secretary of agriculture and aiiomcy general), Republicans
will return to Des Moincs In January with strong 111sz rliics in both the House
and Senate. Thc challenge now will be re craft a working relationship
