Ahrens Foundation commits
$15,000 to Mayflower project

The Claude W. and Dolly Ahrcns
Foundation has committed $15,000 to
the Mayﬂower for development of a
”sensory garden.“

Ted Mokricky, Mayﬂowcr‘s execs
utive director, said the giﬂ is in the
form ofa challenge to others to com~
plete the funding for a special project
at the retirement complex.

Louis Cardinals and, just incidentally,
to see if they could catch Mark
McGwire in his 64th home run in his
race with Sammy Sosa ofthe Chicago
Cubs. Both McGwire and Sosa have
surpassed Roger Maris‘s home-run
record ofél set in-l961.

Besides bonding, it would provide
will, 7, withalifelong piece nrhistory.

The plan didn’t work out quite the
way Bennett had planned because he
thought first ofcatching both McGwire
and Sosa in one weekend by going to
Chicago on Saturday to catch Sosa in a
game with the Cubs, then on to Mil-
waukee to watch McGwire on Sunday,
but Chicago was sold out so he settled
for Milwaukee on Friday.

During the six-hour drive to Mll-
Waukee, Bennett primed Will on some
possible eventualities so he would not
be disappointed ifthe vaunted event
did not occur: lti-night rain; McGwire
might not play (he had suffered shin
splints earlier); he mightnothitahomer
but, best ofall, he might!

Fortunately,the latter occurred when
McGwire hit a homer in the fourth
inning of the game.

Atter spending the night in Milwau-
kee, Bennett and Will began the return

trip to Grinnell on Saturday via CI‘ll»
cago where they planned to celebrate
by eating in a favored restaurant, the
Como lllnonChicago‘s northwest side,
only to ﬁnd it closed. “We had to eat
garbage instead," says Bennett fecle
ingly.

Back in Grinnell, Judy Bennett and
Kate, 9, were having their own little
flingoffemalebondingbygoing bowls
ing. “And Kate almost beat mel" says
ludy.
