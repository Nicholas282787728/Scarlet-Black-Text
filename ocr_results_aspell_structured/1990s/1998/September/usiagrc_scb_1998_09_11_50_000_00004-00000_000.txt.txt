questionmrh respect to the reports that
were submitted last year, tlicre were
lilies, I think. one is it kind ol broad
based report that talked about tecnrit.
irig students and what students drink and
crilcriuns like lllill,.'lnd it was submitted
to my predecessor I don‘t know, but I
guess it was hot nude ptiblic.

Crady:Yealt it was public it's at the

Osgood. So it was made pubhc That
is the main report that rcpon was given
to the architects as one otthe things that
Lhcy ought to rcadThc one thing l'd say
about that rcpott,as someone who read
his that irom what you just said it nururt
seem that there were some real mud and
raw conclusions about what we should
do at the end, My reeling was that it didn‘t
quite end that way. it was more like a
summary oiwhat a lot people said, then
it's got a tew points thatyou might think
about at the end,Tben there were two
other rcpons .,alid they were two very
detaded assessments ol stair strengths

Ci'ady, Let me also talk about
mullicultul'dl spaceihe space commit-
tee is not done and so We‘re going to
continue to meet and work out a ouster
plan, hopeiuuy to kind oi dovetail to
gethcr at the end, and then the decision
is going to be made at that point So the
space committee will continue to meet
this year

Studenl' How has your perception
o/ Grritneil changed since you 'te been
here? ,

Osgood: let me just start with July
3th, when l came. l tool that l was very
warniiy received by townspeople, stu-
dents and iactrlty this sununer So, tor
someone who’s pretty ignorant ot the
community, that was a nice thing.Two,
in the search process, you get to know a
lololadminislmmis A little bil Yau don'l
see much oi the iaculty and you see
hardly anysmdents. So, the more you get
to know about the raciilty, the stronger
you see them to be.That has been my
rmction since ,iuly outwith respect to
studentsl have not mteracted with them
as much as l have with the raculty be-
cause you actually weren't here over the
summer, but l've been having a similar
reaction to slud:nls.Thc whole tlung I
wondered about is — you know. l've
mainly interacted with Law students, alt
though I did teach undergraduate iottlie
last rive years, and l wondered it there
would be a big diiletencc in how you
act and react to tlungs and my reaction
is that there isn't as big a diirerence iisl
thought there would be, but l probably
should have known that.

Sludwll' What'syonrjrer-sonbi Dplll»
ion o/bow l/Je seciniiy committee that's
developing iluw should be int/rte-
merited on ihe mliipux.’

Osgood- beiore l attired, President
Ferguson decided that we should nrove
irom a uiyrtWatch system to a core oi
normal security slaILThaLXlS you know,
is now being implemented l'm going to
give very general answers,and then I'll
say in like to hear ttom anyone about
this issue because l'm not up on it, I'm
not sure that any oius are reriuy up on it
because “'5 happening around us l think
that security in a couege is important. it
was one oi the problems at Cornell. it
was a student demand that we increase
security at Cornell, largely because oi
theit oistudent possessions and icelings
orunsatery at night as people would go
around on campus So,l think security- is
important. I think security ought to be
unobtrusive and low key and ought to
be perceived as triendiy by students But
i think security has to stop bad things
irom liappening,'loin,aren't you on the
security commute

u tuned to do and we did this \\' to ﬁgure
out it nay to do this at autobitusuely as
post lo, and to do l| witlun the turmoil
eultut there are two approaches that we
could have taken We could have just done
‘ anti then you all would have arrived and
it would hurt: been up and running or we
could lune done it morc painstakingly,
which is to lure a director, ptir a student
advising group together to really help turn
shape things in a wiry that he is ruraccus
mated to because he comes from a very
diiterent background, to work in it way
that's more within the culture or the insti
tiitroir,iiird that s the route tlv we chose,
what I would teu you is that v ’ri: going
to rim into problems with this, but the slut
dents involved are very direct ,. Our goal
is to make sureiis Russell saidth it's unr
obitus -e and really here as a service more
than anything else, Frdnldy we didn't do it
hcre bctore i think you all deserve better
intormation about whats going on,and we
just (litln’t do that very well So, that's why
\\ e‘ie doing it

osgoori, The ﬁrst night i was in my
house, the doors locked my mic and my
son and l in our house So i had to call
securi , and they had to climb up on the
scrriiolding on my house to ehmb up, but
then they couldii tget it out, so we had to
disassemble the doorbccattse the locks had
frozen, the keys wouldn'twork lwas gmlCr

could and I torts wondering what you
were planning on doing to change the
image.

Osgaad‘l do agree with what you said 1
said, but l'in going to add rmoihet thing,
which is the study which is on reserve in
the library, it you have read me study, the
study actual_ revealed that the viewbook
and the things—the materials that we haves
were a disincentive to minority students to
apply to Gnnncll, that the image that was
being projected was an image that they
found unappealing and unattractive Su l
drought, ltl's assume units a tact, so i then
went and read the viewbook it any or
you've seen the vicwbook.you'vc probably
seen the clcphiullrno, the luppopotantus-
no, the rhinocclosslhat's on the lronLSDl
went and read this, and I'm obviously iiot
the world‘s cvpert on Grumell, but I didn't
lhink it projected an image that was in
touch Willi What i had Sccn.so I said (0 ll
couple oi iaculty members.“\“/hal do you
think?" and they said that they thought that
the vicwbook was inaccurate. it was kind
otspotty and thin on academic things, and
then not reimy very coherent on student
hie and the cvtent to which responsibility
is involving students i thought the publica-
lions-in tact, the leading publication—um
just inaccurate and didn't attempt to tell
what a good place this is to go to college,
the image it had was just out or sync with
what studentssaid to me Sol thinkwe need
to be more accurate and to send an honest
image about the good tluiigs at Gtinrieu

The diversity oi the l'zicullyilhill's clearly
an arca where we have not met our goals,
We need to do much much bettcr One or
the things i am doing . is that this week
the evecutive councilapproved most oi the
tenure track positions — the descriptions
{or tenure track p . ons rid were put-
ting together substantial display ridds with
illl these positions that will advertise in
places that we hope that potential {acuity

position descriptions toasigniﬁcrmt group

ﬁrmative Action othcer, over the last two
yetits,did begin working with departments
to ﬁnd graduate schools, for cxample,wlih
candidates who might be particularly an
tntctive to send letters and the ltke.We're
wotldng hard on it Clearly things have im»
proved in the last decade at the conegehut
we‘re nowhere near where we want to be,
it's a hard problem

Osgood l‘vc never been to a place
where there was more rhetoric about this
and less by way oi results Something is
going to have to change Bractlywhat,l‘m
not ready to say, but we have to think or
new things

Siudenl, How does d concept such as
sci/governance sin/cejiou based on your
experience icvlih Cornell or other quit-ins
you may have noticed tc'ltb.7

Osgoodl think it's a great system, Now
lrealize when i came throughthat it‘s hard
to get all otyou to participate actively and
seriously, and that's one oi the difﬁculties
or sell governance There's nothing like it
at Coincll,whicll l think has a bad system.
i drink you're all ready to be responsible,
more responsible ior big things in your liie
lts ioolish to treat you without any regard
to sell governance and then you're zt, 22
when you ttnish and suddenly you are re-
sponsible ior everyilung in your liie. l'd be
mil to beat anyone who wants to Cu i no
it or improve it, but i think it's a really good
idea.

Studeni: I've heard a lot of rumors
riboniyotr lL‘alll/ilg to increase Grlimell':
ratings I torts woridenng i/ihnt is true,
bowindyou until to go nbouidoing that,
and t/ll‘: not, how doyoufeci about the
rulings glslem?

Osgoadxl don‘t really know the details
iorthc USNdws rankings forcollcgcs One
oimy lamily must have called and told me
when they came out a tow weeks ago that
Griruiell had gone upa iew placesThatms
where l iound out about it i don't think
that Grinncll should focus hard on rankings,
out I'll tell you a brutal tact, which is stu-
dents ovcrwhclariingly elect on where to
go to college based on the ratings, Not all
do,but ol'crwhcli'nii'lgly,50 a coucge has to
be concerned with projecting an image
about why it's a good place and why Slu~
dents ought to come here and ought to ens
coumge them to come and learn more than
a siriiple ranking, So i think it's something
we all. everybody hves with i don't think
we should concentrate on the details oldie
ranking system. but I think we should get
everybody to know what a great place this
is.

Sludmil‘ I was mourn-ring iuiraiyour-
[eeinig ions on the current state o/merita
on campus?

argood: l'll letTom answer that ﬁrst,and
ilien l'll have a go.

Crabby i can tell you irom last spring
that there are obvious concerns about me-
tlia and funding, and also advising media
on campus What i would tell you is in the
history oi my years here. these concerns
really haven't gone away They've always
been at a certain level lvy Chang, who's
the head UFSPARC, and Peterrtnd-who else
is going reteti

Kinetscir. Jessica right now, and possi»
bly a setmtot

Cmrhr are going to get together and
talk about sum: and issues related. One
orthc things i suggested was . the possi
bility oi having advisors uivolvcd. For ex
ample, I advised KDIC ior years, and the
reason that l did that was that i worked in
radio ior many years beiore i came to
Grinnell Collcgc,2.ud sol happen to know
something about it,or used to;l'm not sure
anymore. l‘in still licensed though. but so
we need to look at the possibility olhav
mg tlvisors The other thuig that's really
unclear right now, and also ot concern to
studcu ,is that the tiioneys that go to stu-
tlclll publications don't have to report —
thei-c s no mechanism ior reporting how
the money is spent back to the campus So
we've had numerous students who’ve
raised concerns about that My style is not
to say "we have to do it lhis way." My style
is lllor' along the lines or why don't we
get it group oi people to determine how
much oi an issue it is and see iiwe Ciln‘t

ﬁnd some kind or way to resolve it.To be
quite honest, it's not an issue that we've
had ior long, estcept in certain areas in
the past, but l have heard a greater vol
tune oi student concern in the past year
regarding this particular issue than in an
the years I’ve been her‘c So i drink the
time is good to look at son-u: oi iiiese is-
sucsl can-t reu you what unit is rigrt now,
but I think that we're going to at least en-
gage in some oi these discussions One or
the real issues is the tact that the pubhca-
tions oitendon't have enough money, and
the same is true of the campus radio sta-
tion.Arid so we buy ourselves oii with
supplementing moneys For cvample,we
had a computer stolen irom the publica-
tions building a month ago; we've got to
replace it We may need a new board ior
