Vacuum excludes athletes, and this

This Grinnell frlglltcns me. I find
its values and institutions twisted and
sometimes devoid ofrcal thought. As
I slt on the sidelines, and look out, I
am caught in the despair of rhc
masses, tlic non-athletes, and am
jilred by their indifference and seem-
ingly constant barrage ofhatred and
belligerence, Their story captivates
me even more so when I look onto
the field and Si( in the locker room
and see the ambivalent, self-serving
attitude athletes do luvs.

Athletes, it seems, like everyone
else here, arestereotyped, thought of
as a different brecd, and'izxcludctl.

The men's soccer team started its
season well. The Pioneers won their
ﬁrst game on September 3 in front of
a home crown. The victory was caps
rured on tape taken from atop a video
tower that now stands looming over
Ward Field

The women's soccer team started
its season well, too. The Lady Pioneers
won their ﬁrst game on September 1
in front ofa home crowd. Their vic.
tory, however, was not recorded from
any video tower on lane springer

for the women’s ﬁrst game.

Despite initial thoughts of gender
inequﬂy by some on the Women'sxoo
cer ream. the lack ofa video tower for
the Lady Pioneer's opening game
turned our to be a mistake rather than
a deliberate strike at female athletes.

“The tower was my fault,”
women's head soccer coach Heather
Benningsaid. “1 didn’t get the request
(to put the tower up) in until the day
ofrhe game."

Since the request came in late, the
grounds crew was not able to get the
scaffolding tip in time for the ﬁrst
game. Benningsaid itwould be up for

sophomore Susie Przybylinski, a

for a 1 pm game Saturday, Sept. 12.

A disciplined St. Olaf team chrile

Carleton provided coach sonnichsen
with the opportunity to get all 21 of
his players into varsity competition,
solid play by sophomore susic
Przybylinski and junior captain
Donahue earned them All-Tournae
ment recognition.

“There is no reason we shouldn't
be 4-0 right now. We must execute
on our outside hitting, toughen our
service and be more aggressive on
blocks," concluded Sonnichsen. “\mk

overtime, Bczdicek again rocketed a
shot to score the game-winning goal
for St. Olaf

“Both of their goals were similar
in that we had a poor transition to at-
tack. He hit two really nice shots,”
explained the coach.

Looking ahead to tomorrow's
march—up against Cornell, Coach
Wood says: “Cornell has been a much—
improved program over the last two
years, so we are anticipating a com—
petitive match. Every time we step
onto the ﬁeld, it is our goal to play
better than the day before so that we
will have a legitimate chance at our
longttcrm goal of playing for a Con-
ference title in November."

“our goal for the Cornell meet

“This year three teams advance

Perhaps the best person to judge
the level of athletic gender equity at
Grinnell is athletic director Dee
Pairchild.

“Glinncll i it good shape (with

“1 think there’s inequity, but 1
think that thereisinequiryeverywlrere,
lfyou want to follow Title 1x to a tee,
total equity can never happen,"
Benning said, “But 1 feel really good
about equality herc "

The “Title 1x" that Benning refers
to isTitle IX ofrhe Education Amend-
ments of 1972. Tule 1x is the speciﬁc
amendment rhat mandates equality
among tlleszxcs in educational activi—
ties including athletics, Title 1x is the
measuring stick most frequently used
to determine ifgender inequity exists
in athletics.

Although Title IX means well, its
ambiguous language can make it easy
for some to make claims of inequity.
As Hoy said, “Gender inequity is an
issue like mosr.1fyou go actively look.
ing fora problem, you're going to ﬁnd
it.“

And those actively looking for in-
equity on college campuses may ﬁnd
many examples that they believe prove
an inequity exists. For instance. one
may ﬁnd that in one year at some col

lege the men's soccer team received
new uniforms and warmvups, but the
womcn’s soccer ream received neither.

While some may pcrccivc this as a
gross irictjuity,Tirle 1Xscholars would
disagree. According to Title IX expert
Valerie M, Bonnetre in “Title IX Ba-
sics," the most accepted approach
taken when looking at possible ineq-
uity is not to compare two sports, but
to ratlrercomparo theenrrrc men’s pro.
gram with the entire women's pro-
gram. So if the wornerrs basketball
team at the same college in the ex-
ample received new uniforms and
watm»ups while the men's team did
not, things would be equitable under
Title of law.

The facts at Grinncll appear to sup
port the claims ofeouiry in athletics.
Grinricll boasts 10 men's varsity teams
and 10 women’s. New uniforms are
purchased on a regular basis regard.

ing to Pairchild. The Grinnell athletic
staffconsrsrs ofseven male coaches and
ﬁve female coaches.

“1 don‘t know too many schools
that have that type of balance,"
Pairchild said.

Przyhylinski agrees that gender
eouiryis at a good level at crinnell. “1
don't feel like equity really needs to be
addressed here," he said, “We’re pretty
comfortable where we are."

Pairehild said she aims to keep aths
