Bailey Park playground project launched

Restoration efforts have begun at
Bailey Park to expand and improve
facilities for use by students at Bailey
Park Elementary School.

The school never has had its own
playground such as other Grinnell el-
emeutary schools, relying instead on
Bailey Park as its playground, An
addition to the school in a building
program last year diminished a small
play area onthe south side of the school.

Because Bailey Park has low»lying
areas whichtumboggyin wetweather,
it often is unsuitable for playground
activities,

The restoration program by Bailey
Park Parent~Teacher Organization
playground committee has raised
$14,000 ofa projected goal of$50,000
to drain the playground and provide
improved playground equipment for
the students who now are from kinder-
garten through second grade.

Tiling of the park was completed
this fall and it is hoped the playground
renovation can be completed by the
summer of1999.

Playgroundequipmenttobeinstalled
includes a dome climber by Miracle
Recreation and a modern play struc-
ture which includes wooden slides and
climbers which require varying de-
grees of balance and coordination and
will encourage children of all abilities
to participate.

Volunteers from the PTO, who have
raisedfunds frombakesales, anannual
jamboree and sale of Tiger Paw ﬂags,
are expanding their efforts to include
the remainder ofthe community since
the park belongs to the entire commu-
nity.

Efforts are being made to contact
private individuals, foundations, busi-
nesses, civic clubs and other groups to
complete the project.

A recent giﬁ of$500by the Grinnell
Rotary Club was the ﬁrst-phase of the
new Builders‘ Club campaign with
different levels of giﬁs, according to
PattyLloyd,spokespersonforthePTO.

The PTO also welcomes contri-
butions ofcash and merchandise, more
volunteers and corru-riittee members,
construction assistance, food, bever-
ages, child care and other pertinent
items to make the Bailey Park restora-
tion a real community project.

Benefit effort for Nicaraguan
relief successful, to continue

A successful fundriaising project here
to aid victims of Hm'ricane Mitch in
Central America will continue, accord-
ing to Karin Stein and Jeannie Chenette
who have spearheaded the effort.

The original project took place soon
after the hurricane’s disastrous effect on
the small nations in the land mass be-
tween North and South America when it
became evident that damage and loss of
life were so severe that international
relief efforts would not be sufﬁcient.

Focus at the time was on the Castro
fanuly in Nicaragua, relatives of Juan
and Reyna Jimenez, native Nicamguans
who are long-time Grinnell residents.

Stein and Chenette ananged two ben-
eﬁt concerts, one at the college and one

Joslyn Bennett, Grinnell College stu»
dents, spearheaded efforts at Grinnell

as blankets, food and possibly a few old

according to Stein. Although no mem-
bers of the families lost their lives, all

leading up to the Amos Alonzo Stagg
Bowl, the Division 111 championship
game played Saturday, Dec. 12.

“Troy is a worthy candidate for the

yards and 45 .6 points per game which
ranked ﬁfth and third nationally.

“Troy is the finest QB I‘ve ever
coached,“ said Grinnell Coach Greg
Wallace. “He sees the ﬁeld well, has
a sense ofpass rush pressure and does
whateveris necessaryto helpthisteam
win. Probably his greatest strength as
a passer is his accuracy.

The Aztec Bowl pits the top Divi-
sion in senior gridders against the
best players from the Mexican Fed-
eration of American Football. The
American participants will train un-
der the tutelage of former Central
College Coach, Ron Schipper, for a
week in Monterey, Mex., before they
will take on the Mexican squad on

and ranked ﬁlth nationally with 83
receptions a game.

“Richard was our gorto guy in al-
most every siluation.," said Wallace.
“He mounted our squad on his back
during a few games and carried us to
victory. It is very gratifying for me to
see Richard get a chance to play in the
Aztec Bowl because he is one ofthe
top all-around athletes in the nation."

included an 8—0 mark in the Midwest

“He said, ‘What we need is a bas-

“They were having to stan kids offin
practice at 6 am and try to schedule
boys and girls all on one court. So 1
said I'd do this,"

Residents of Grinnell weren't sur»
prised when Ahrens made his official
announcement at a ground-breaking
eeremonyin May. (Work already was
underway on the new athletic facility
at that time.)

After all, this was the same Claude
Ahrens who had made numerous other
lasting contributions to the commu-
nity.

He and his late wife, Dolly, set up
the $500,000 AchievementTrust Fund

ating seniorsat Grinnell High School,

“I‘ve had many people come up to
me and say how wonderful that was,"
Ahrens said, “My wife felt the same
way; that we should recognize the
children who make the school system
what it is e the average kids who
make things happen in the school dis-
trict."
