Dowkins' Violet
Isis opens doors

BY CYNTHIA ROGALIN
Staff ertu

When Violer Isis was hrsr pub-

Dawkins was rnrercsred in crearing a
lirerary piihlicarion rhar picked up
where, she relr, rhe Freehand Press and
rhe Revlcw, neglecred, Namely, erone

“I decided rocreareTheVroler lsis

ing and puhlishing (I worked as a
hoard rnemher ror Freehand Press lasi

wanred ro change rhar."

unrorrunarcly ror Dawkins, rhe

“I needed no puhliciae The Violer

ihrir rhe signs wirh rhe woman and
rhe hooded min were disappearing."

sirrprised hy ihe censorship,

Dawkins wrore a lerrer ro rhe soda,
and decided to only hang puhliciry
signs wirh rexr.

A year larer, Dawkins mainrains
rhai rhe picrures were meanr ro he ncir
rher offensive nor againsr women.

“Generally, images orhondage and
suhmission are railored for ihe man's
poinr ofvicw. This pierure was, I sin-
eerely rhoughr, as a crinnellian and a
feminlsr, was nor olrensive as ir riirned
rhe rahles, oilrers ohvioirsly rhough
dirrerenrly," she said.

More rhan rhe rask or erearing

whar 'the censorship said ahour ilre

l relr Grinncll was open, espc.
cially ahour sex and arrirudcs nhour

This year, only cosinerie changes
have heen made in Violer lsis, rlie cori-
renr remains rhe same.

“We srill puhlish erorica, niy reliice
ranee ro slioiri ihis our ro ihe
contrary. ..This year, lwanr people ro

ro look ar We will examine aiiyrhing
suhinirred, including comics, yokes,
soeial coinmenrary, essays, academic
papers, as well as rhe usual poeiry and
ricrion," said Dawkins.

John cummius, '01, who is die

copy ediror, joined ihis year so assisr
Dawkins in rhe production.

“ ,.I'vc really like rhe idea orheing
a parr ora puhlicarion rhai provides a
forum for more erorie, sensual air and
lircraeure. ianann needed some help
with the logistics ofrunnlng Violct Isis
and eoediiing Freehand, so i offered
my help," said Cummlns.

Despire rhe changes, rhe goal ofrhe
Violet Isis remains the same,

“Tllc Vlolct Isis still wanrs (o be a

Dawkins,

Although rhe "ofﬁcial" deadline
was November 18 Fotsubmisslons to

“.,,Soine people iriusr srill remem.

Dawklns

And so, wieliour regard in rlre

oprrmisric ahour this ycar's Violer lsis,

She said, i suppose as hearr rliis
