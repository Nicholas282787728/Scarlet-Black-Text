Medical Center begins 7998 annual fund drive

Grinncll Regional Medical Center
Wlll launch its 1998 annual fund drive
this Friday with a lettercarnpaign.

The annual fund drive gencratcs
money for equipment and services
throughout the hospital. It is separate
from, but complementary to, the
hospital’s ongoing Building on Excel-
lencc capital campaign.

“As a nonproﬁt medical center,
GRMC depends on the regular gen.
crosity ofindividuals and companies to
suppontheinstitution,"saidEdHatcher,
board chair.

Hatchernoted that, through an exten-
sivc budgeting process, the medical
center dcvelops a plan to live within its
means, GRMC differs from many ruml
hospitals in that it does not receive any
support fromiax revenue. It depends on
billingsandgiftstosupportitselfandits

Reimbursement Chilnges

“Changes in health-care reim-
bursement from Medicare, the Health
Care Financing Administration and in-
suranee companies challenge the eco»
nomic balance of operating a medical
center and make the annual fund drive
necessary," said Todd Linden, presi-
dent and CEO. “Last year, giﬁs from
supporters to the annual fund generated
$40,000. These giﬁs continue to be cm-
cial in the medical center‘s ability to

A tobacco windfall?
Iowa could be a winner

[fthe deal is consummated, [owa will receive 3 1.7 billion over the next
quarter century from thenzition's four leading tobacco ﬁrms under an
agreement that's bccn negotiated by several state attorneys gcncral, including

Iowa‘s Tom Miller.

That‘s a great deal of money, even though payments would be spread out
over 25 ycars. But it’s not a fail needing/17 far from it. It still requires
formal approval by a majority ofihe states, and some (notably New York and
California) don't think the settlement is big enough, Nor is it clear what
restrictions the federal government might place on whatever settlement

ultimately becomes a reality.

The state littomcys general began the negotiations with Big Tobacco wtth

the intent of winning reimbursement
for the money the states have had to
pay the healthrcare industry for
trcating people with tobacco»rclatcd
tlliicsscs. Medicaid funds have been
used to pay physrcians and hospitals
for those treatments, and the costs
havc been huge.

Nationally, the deal reached
with the tobacco companies this
week would mean a total payout of

$206 billion, a staggering sum. In addition, the tobacco companies would
face new restiictions on how they advcnise their products and would cough
up on additional $1.5 billion fol an anti-smoking campaign. in turn, though,
the companies would be iinniunizctl to an extent against future lawsuits.

One big question remains unanswered will Congress get back into the acl?
Earlier this year, it appeared that some kind of an agreement would be
rcticlicd between the goveliimeiit and the tobacco ﬁnns, but that fell apart.
Still. Congress and the Clinton Administration could become involved again,
:ilihougli few are anticipating that. Wliiitcvcr happens, tlioiigh, thcrc appears
to bc lililc doubt that tlic federal govcrinncnt ivill have a say with rcgard to
how the states can use the money they receive from the tobacco companies.

So it‘s not likely that low tind the other 37 states involvcd in the proposed
settlement will be able to funncl tobacco moncy into everything from roads to
public safety. The lion's share ofthe money will be earmarked for Mcdicald
rciniburscnicnt, and that’s the way it should be Any Windfall from Big
Tobacco Wlll be the restilt ofliealllirielnted issues, and that's how most of it

ought to bc spent.

Maybe the settlement isn't perfect, But, for states like Iowa, it's about as

good a deal tis they’re likely to get.

Tax-deductible donations

“Donors to the annual drive gain the
beneﬁt ofsupporting the medical cenr
tor, and their donations are tax-deduct-
ible," saidloanne Bunge, director oftlie
Ofﬁce ofDevelopment at GRMC. “The
greatest beneﬁt to donors is knowing
that they are partneis in providing quala

“No one really plans to stay at the

incl udethe emergency department, sur-

stetrlcs unit and an intensive care unit.
The plan includes converting to private
patient rooms, creating upgrades and
relocating several other services.

Both drives important

“Both fund drives are important to
the future of health care for the area,”
Hatcher said. “Funds are designated to
ensure that hcalthrcare services meet
and exceed consumers‘ expectations.
As we move into the next century and
the Baby Boomers age, our institution
needs to be prepared to offer the ser»
vices required and desired. Contribur
tions to the medical center can accom-
plish that.”

Donors who wish to make a tax
deductible contribution for 1998 must
do so by Dec.‘ 31. Those who do not
receive an annual fund drive letter by
Dec. 1 but who would like to make a
donation should call the Ofﬁce of De-
velopment at 236-2593.
