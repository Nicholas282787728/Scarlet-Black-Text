in 1978 it was a war the punctured our
hearts. A war that .sentvbrother against
brother into battle, a war that excluded the
needs or the homeless. the poor and the
faithful. lt snatched from us many family
members, but it did not take away our faith
and we eventually rebuilt.

in 1995 Nicaragua raced its biggest
challenge as Hurricane Mitch demolished
the land in epic proportions. Thousands
died and thousands more left homeless.
Today children walk the streets alone not
knowing if their parents are alive, today
parents ean only watch in sadness as their
children cry ofhunger, today Nicaragua is
at the mercy of God. Hurricane Mitch
carried away with it many lives, homes and
lands but it did not take away our faith
and we will eventually rebuild.

In the next few days, weeks and
months you will see Nicaragua in
high spirits. You will see singing and
praying in the streets. You see, from
outside you may view Nicaragua as a
poor and unfortunate country, but,
to Nicaraguans we feel that we are the
richest people on the Earth, We live
a simple life, one that is dedicated to
God and the family. We find rich-
ness not in money or material things
but instead in one another’s hearts
and in faith

“And God shall wipe away all the
tears From their faces;

and there shall be no more death,
nor sorrow or crying,

neither shall there be any more
pain, tor the iormer things

are passed away"

Thank you all for sharing your
hearts with us. We deeply appreciate
the support and love We have received
’from both friends and strangers, We
are truly blessed (a be in the presence
of this community support. Our
families in Nicaragua will be both
extremely happy and grateful for

“We went thought this once be—
fore during the war," said Rena
Jimenez. “You don't know how much
we appreciate the help of the com—
muniry.‘ Rena Jimenez followed her
husband to iowa during the Nicara-
guan Civil War in 1979. Her mother,
brother. sisters and their families still
live in Esteli, Their oldest son is a
Gtinnell College graduate and is cur-
rently married and works as a teacher
in Sioux City. “I have talked with my
brother, all oftheir houses have been
destroyed but my mother’s. They will
live there until new houses can be
builL It will be very hard, because
there are so many houses that will
need to be built...so many buildings
were destroyed He also said he
wants to move his family into our
mothers house as soon as he can. Ev-
eryone is coughing; people are get-
ting sick and there is no medicine
But still, he is hopeful. He said, ‘we
are lucky to still have a house at all.’
And when he came back after the
ﬂood, he found two sugar cane plants
still alive on his property and he told
me “it's like the Lord is trying to tell
us its alright.”

Rena )imenez also rcels' lucky to
have a house. “We are very appre-
clativc; I have told my husband,
‘we’te lucky to have a house and a
roof and meals and a bed,” During
the storm, including the Jimenezs’
relatives, Nicaraguan: lived and slept
anywhere they could, packing tightly
into churches, convents and commu-
nity buildings. The Jimenez family
do their best to support their family
back home. but are weary ofsending
money or packages in the mail.

“in send a letter in the mail, and
a person in Nicaragua sees that there
is a postmark from the United States
on it, they will go though it and look
for money...many letter I have sent
my mother though the mail never
made it to herat all.” Instead of
mail, the Jimenez family use a ser.
vice called O.M.S. Deliveries to send

mail and packages,

"They are expensive, but they will
take leucrs and packages to the door
[of‘ the addressee],” said Mrs
Jimenez:
