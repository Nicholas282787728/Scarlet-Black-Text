“Over the years, the films have
ranged from such subjccts as def»
ecation and urination to pcnis dlSr
membcrineiit and Irish boating,”
commcntod Aaron Dale ‘98, These
are the typos of images one might
see this Saturday night at 10 pin in
Harris, for it is time for Titulnr
Hcad.

Studcnt have been tnaking lrlOV-
ics “since the crcation oi'the event
in 1913 by Crime“ physics ma-
jars," as Dalc, who is running the
event this year along with Ellery
Fralitn ‘99, commented. Dale went
on to give a bit more history of the
event, mentioning that the physics
majors “desired a forum in which
they might display the moving daA
guerreotypes they were able to cre-
are through new equipment donated
by alumni." The phrase “Titular
Head" means, as Dalc went on to
add, “csscntially, ‘figurehead,’ a
lcadcr whose power is largely sym-
bolic. The Queen of England, for
example, is the titular head of the
United Kingdom.

Regardless ofthe historical back
ground of thc cvcnl, however, it has
evolved into a festival having move
ios which can be very dramatic and
deep, or very disgusting and vile.
t-tumor usually seems to be a major
aspect of many of them, however.

Titular Head “plays many roles
on campus," as Chris Moseng ‘00
mentioned.

“Directors get to harass friends
and strangers alike, making them do
bizarre things in the name of ‘ﬁlm
making,’ student actors can either
boost their ego ortarnish their good
name, and revelers can toss marshy
mallows at a big screen TV."
Moscng concluded by saying that
the movie making is “all in the
name of fun.”

“The time limit is ﬁve minutes,”
Dale commented; filmmakers
therefore need to keep their movies
short and sweet.

Jamal Rogers ‘00. who was in
troduced ta Titular Head last year
and is making a couple of movies
this year, mentioned how it can be
extremely hard for a, director “to (:07
ordinate pcople, places, etc." for a
movie. It is oftentimes difﬁcult to
turn “what you’ve been visualizing
in your head" into an actual movie,
as Rogers added. He plans on ten»
tering a movie which he produced
last semester, as well as one which
he made just recently.

Frahm, as previously mentioned,
is helping Dale run this year’s event.
He landed the position after win-
ning one of the awards given out
during last year’s Titular Head.

Therefore Frahm will inherit the job
ofTitular Head Coordinator next for
next year. He is also producing a
movie of his own.

“My movie this year will be like

what I’ve done,” he continucd, “last
year’s movie was wellsrcccivctl.
Hopefully people will like this one."

Frahm speculated that last year
there were between fourteen to
twenty movies shown at Titular
Head, He and Dale were not sure
how many movies they would re—
ceive this year, but they plan to show
all of the ones submitted

Ofthe two movies he plans to sub
mit, Rogers did not “want to let the
cat out of the bag" before tomorrow

just wrote a script, with a loose plot
and characters. I wanted to stick to
the dramatic form." Rogcrs' second

complete opposite." Having ”a joke

is just “a random combination of

Making himself Heard

BY KATRYN NONAS
Staff Writer

Tenor Richard Heard, accompar
riled by pianist Barbara Lien, will
perform at Grinnoll College in
Herrick Chapel on Sunday, April 12
at 8:00 pm. The concen is free to all
audience members and the invitation
is extended to Grinnell students, fac-
ulty, staff and community members.

Heard's performance is entitled
“Artsongs of African American

ﬁrst album due to be released in Scps
rember 1998.This recitalruns along
side Ralph Russell's “Musical Black
Americans" class, Heard’s
preformztnce will act as supplement
to the black composers in a classical
music sogement of the class.

Heard is scheduled to sing songs
that celebrate black history, includ-
ing “Grief" by William Grant Still,
“Dancing in the Sun” by John Work.
“Minstrel Man" by Margaret Bonds,
“Sometime I Feel Like A Motherless
Child" by H.T. Burleigh. “I’ll Never
Turn Back" by W.C, Handy and “His
Name Is So Sweet" by Edward
Boatner.

Russell and Heard have a friends
ship that dates back to 1986 at the
University of California, Santa Bar»
barn. “We’re old friends,” stated
Russell. Heard went on to complete
his master's in music from the Uni-
versit of California. Santa Barbara

musicians whose varied style and
funsftlled approach to jazz have
madethem popularthrough out the
country. The concert is at 9 pm in
South lounge. SeeSGA‘s publicitylor

After his education, Hoard had his
first performance at the Aspen Muv
sic Festival. Since his debut, Hoard
has earned his notoriety for his lead-
ing tenor roles in Italian Bel Canto
opera and most ofthe major Mozart
repertoire. “He has quite a bit otpcr—
forming experience. He is a very tal-
ented vocalist," claimed Russell,
Currently, Heard is an Instructor of
Voice at Wake Forest University in
North Carolina.

When he participated in the Met-
ropolitan Opera Auditions, Heard
ﬁnished as a regional ﬁnalist. Sincc
then, he has rccieved prestigious
awards, such as grants from the Na
tional Society of Arts and Letters,
Rotary International, the Fuchs Ops
era Awards, and Mu Phi Epsilon.

In December of 1994, Hcard
made his European debut, Fol this
next season he will pcrform concerts
in Germany, appearing witlt the
Salisbury Symphony, Winston-Sa—
lcm Piedmont Triad Symphony and
the Piedmont Chamber Singers.

Also, the very accomplished
Heard has appeared with orchestras
all over the United States, singing
pieces by Bach, Halide], Haydn and
Mozart. Performing Handel’s “Mcs»

siah" With the Lake Chtlrlcs Syln-'

phony and Beethoven's “Ninth Sym-
phony" with the Dallas Symphony,
Heard has earned a reputation as a
phenomenal tcnor.

In addition, he has participated in
recitals at Jackson State Univcrsity,
University or Southern Mississippi,
Southwest Missouri State UanCrSily,
Winstoanalcm State University.
Bennett College, Southwestern Bap-
tist Theological Seminary and South

and is a bunch of “random events
slapped togcthcr,”

Jtikingly, Rogers said that “if I
won something, it would frighten
me; it would mean that my movie
was great."

Hoping to “entertain the audi-
ence,“ in addition to himself, Rogers
hopes to “continue making movies
as a hobby, and hopes that people can
enjoy them."

Moseng spoke of his movie, says
ing that “my tape is a knock off of
the TV action-drama genre. I won't
go too much into detail," he men
tioned, but said earlier in the week
that his cditing equipment had her
come “a very good friend. My goal
at Titular Head,” as Moscng cl»

egantly stated, “is to amuse those that
came to be amused, and irritate those
that came to be irritated. IfI can do
that," he concluded, “I win.”

The ﬁlms, “as dictated by tradi-
tion," as Dale described, “are each
judged by a panel of students (and,
possibly, non-students) so that the
three ﬁlms most deservtng of recog
nition may be given trophies." The
trophies are to be constructed by
Dale and Frahm, as Dale continued,

“using funds generously granted by -

the Student Government Associas
tion." Last year, the trophies were
constructed out of antique baby dolls
with metal appendages super glued
on them, which were then given
mowhawks and spray-painted gold,
Dale explained, He went on to con-

3

clude that such mantle-worthy tra-
phies will be created and given out
this year as well.

Hoping to get better equipment for
the event this year, Dale also added
that he would like to be able to ar~
range the maximum possible sound
for the movies.

After hearing of some of the mov-
ics shown at previous Titular Heads,
there is no way to guess what type
of student productions one might
witness this year.

“Whether or not all Titular Head
movies seem to serve the singular
purpose orroistingboiabon'ng one or

“last year, the
sonic combination
of the low-sound-
quality ...with the
screaming of a
large audience of '
drunken idiot
goddamn punk
college kids made
some of the
mavies really
f**king hard to
hour.”

another of Grinnell‘s inside jokes and
idiosyncrasies an all in attendance,"
Moscng mentioned, “they're still
worth watching,"

Indeed. Come to the festival this
year, see some crazy stuff, and have
a good time, Some movies should be
dramatic and intellectual, while oth-
ers will be crazy, insane, and just ‘
plain strange. As Moseng said, many
of the movies poke fun at some of
the aspects of Grinncll which only
those who attend could know about.

“They are Very Grinnell-speciﬁc."
as Frahm mentioned. “They usually
make more sense to people who
know about Grinnell."
