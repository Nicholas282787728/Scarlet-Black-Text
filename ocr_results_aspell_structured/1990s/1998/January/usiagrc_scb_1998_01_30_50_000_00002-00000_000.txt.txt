sible that will help identify the cul-
prit to the police. Details such as
license plates, vehicle types, heights
and sizes can mean the difference
between having leads or having
nothing," he said. “There are laws
and the police are dedicated to pure
suing justice "

The Grlnliell Human Rights
Commission was founded in 1969
and is dedicated to furthering come
munication between different

marily with issues including housV

litg, employment and conditions at

anyone feels that he or She has been
discriminated against or if someone
has witnessed discrimination, these
persons are urged to contact the Grin-
nell Police department ﬁrst, and then

.thc Human Rights Commission to

ﬁle a report. Schild emphasized the
willingness of the Commission, po»
lice department and other groups to
assist in combating racially moti-
vated discrimination. “We will pur-
sue justice in every case brought to
our attention," he said,

edge related to this senior event,
Lambert offered the following advice
to seniors planning to attend. “Be-
gin with lots of starch for the stem»
ach; it soaks up the hooch. Start
slow, since you never know which
unrequited lust or longing lurks at the
end of the bar. You're completing the
circle begun during the name games
at Flayfair .. . above all, maintain
plaustble deniability, You still have
another 99 days left in your niche,
don‘t rock the boat too hard." Lam-
bert admitted that “this advice is all
absurd anyhow. We’re just going to

Friday: Jan. 30

get saucy and surly till the sun comes
up . . .ju'st like last year."

lars each, entitling the holder to un-

Superbowl

until after the swim meet." said
Emily Stamey ‘01,

Some students who chose not to
watch the game spent a few pror
ductive hours at the library
or in the computer
labs, wrapping up
the weekend’s
homework. Others
concentrated on Ztir
tcrnative activrties,
unwilling to devote
an entire afternoon to
football.

“I would watch the
SuperBowl,”claimed Nat
Hopkins ‘98, “if I didn’t
have a life."

Greg Steirer ‘01 agreed.
“Watching sports doesn't (lo
much for me." he said.

Some compromised by concenr
trating on the famous Super Bowl
commercials. Arguably the best ones
of the year. they often act as minus
ture dramas to be followed through»
out the game,

”I only watched commercials,"
said Jen Collins ‘00. “I studied dur-
ing the game."

A halftime show featuring
Motown Records also provided d1-
versions from the actual game. Per»
formances by familiar celebrities
such as Smoky Robinson, Boyz II
Men, and The Temptations received
mixed reviews from students,

“It was a good time," Said LIZ Gmf
‘01. “I liked it... it was a halftime
show for everyone."

Brian Princer ‘99 had an entirely
different opinion, “The halftime

show was pure and utter garbage,"
he said, “It was basically some has-
been Motown stars trying to gettheir
last hurrah before their arteries
harden."
In any case, the show Cone
tributed to the game’s
celebratory atmosphere.
Students agreed that a
large part of the Super
~ Bowl’s attraction is the
opportunity it provides
forentertainmentand
isocializing.

"Watching alone

would be differ

out," said Emily

Cripe ‘01,

“But it‘s fun

w h e n

everyone’s

cheering and getting

‘ into the game. It‘s a great

way to have fun and eat good food
with friends."

“It’s a good thing the Broncos
won." said Danilo Juvane ‘01, “bee
cause the Packers won last year. It
was somebody else's turn."

Both Broncos and Packers fans
agreed that the game left little to be
desired in terms of fast—paced action
and suspense,

“It was a wellrplayed game," said
Princet, “one you just like to watch,”

Both thoroughly enjoyed by those
who chose to watch and hardly
missed by those who didn’t, Super
Bowl XXXII served its purpose by
providing an afternoon of food
friends, and good football for the tak-

ing.
