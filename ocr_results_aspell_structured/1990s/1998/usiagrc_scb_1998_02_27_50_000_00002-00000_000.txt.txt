iz’reeidential Candidates

Petar Klaetsch

I envision this statement ofintent
as myjob application to you, the stu~
dents ofGrinnell College. What will
you get ifyou select me as President
of your Student Government Assos
ciation? You would be electing a lisr
tenrng. caring, competent student
representative

Ilistcn. In a bureaucratic role. like
SGA President. “US has to be a pri-
mary trait. The president will be
called upon to listen to a myriad of
voices and factions on campus and
accurately reﬂect those views and
concerns to the rest of the commur
nity. Like many of you, I have had
some officral listening experience as
an S.A. for Younkcr. Additionally.
in a personal capacity. I think I have
made a point to develop a reputation
as someone who can be trusted when
spoken to. Your president will be
called upon to help find solutions to
many problems. When solving prob-
lems, I think trust and respect go
hand In hand. By earning people’s
trust, you will have all interested
parties’ respect; this is important so
as to effectively meet individual
goals while staying within the
bounds of what the rest of the coir
lcge ﬁnds acceptable

I’m realistic. In electing me you
won‘t be indicating your preference
fora revolutionary SGA. you will be
indicating your preference for both
a concerned and practical represen»
tative. [pride myself on being able
to ask questions. Good questions
indicate a person both willing to Us
ten to the answers and willing to act
and inﬂuence in the right direction,
Often times a President’sjob will be
to help people deﬁne and solve the
pr'cblems they think are most press-
ing. Grinnell is a place ﬁlled with
ambition. desire. and promise. Ien<
courage people to pursue goals that
are beneﬁcial to themselves and the
rest of the community. As the leader
of the Cabinet I Will do my best to
make sure that SGA makes these
pursuits as fruitful as possible.

Candidates for Vice President/

President of Academic Affairs

Jessica Dvorak

How does one start off a statement of intent? With ﬂowery language. a
story. a catchy saying. or perhaps a little profanity to draw in the audience?
All of those introductions distract from the basic issues of who I am. why I
am running. and what kind of voice I will give you as your SGA Vice Presi»
dent.

My name is Jessica Dvorak. and I am ajunior history major. During my
tenure at Grinnell. I have been a letter-winner on the women's golf team, a
member of orchestra and orchestra committee. a participant in GEAR. a
tutor to an ESL middle school child, a part of the mock trial team, and rep-
resentative in the History Department SEPC. I am currently head of Cam-
pus Young Democrats (don‘t worry this is a nonpartisan campaign) and
leader of the SCA (that weird group that likes to reenact the Middle Ages).
More importantly. I have been an SGA senator and hail ﬂoor representative;
therefore I am well aware ofthe necessary qualiﬁcations and time commit-
ment required for the office of VicerPresidcnt.

I Wish to be your Vice President because I have a strong desire to be the
voice for our community. I want to ensure that the needs of the entire stus
dent body are being addressed and further open the lines of communication
between the students. staff, faculty. and trustees. I will fulﬁll the day-to-day
jobs ofthe Vice President, like chairing the Student Council on Curriculum
and being a member ofJoint Board. by listening to this campus and doing
what it feels is right. Reasserting student control over student life is my top
priority.

As I see them, the most important issues facing the campus next semester
are focusrng on better communication with the trustees and SPACE. The
trustees seem to be out oftouch with Grinnell College students. They want
to turn us into another Harvard, but haven’t yet realized that We chose Grinnell
because it was not Harvard. Grinnell is a unique institution because of its
academic cxccllcnce and its distinct atmosphere. Yes. things can be ini-
proved. but trying to change Grinnell‘s colors to ivy green is not the solu-
tiotr. The trustees have agreed to provide the mutlrcultural SPACE so long
sought after by students. but now that we have it what are we going to do
With it? What are we going to do in the interim between now and the real-
ization ofthis promise? These are questions the trustees must address. andI
feel they should be guided by student input as much as possible. Other
issues wrll arise throughout the year. and. as those come up. I will turn to the
students for advice and solutions. I will ensure that selfsgovcrnance is not
merely meaningless jargon.

Ifyou have any comments. suggestions, questions. or advice. please don ’i
hesitate to call me at x3553. vax me [DVORAK]. or stop by my room on
Haincs 2nd.

Thanks.

Hi. my name is SantirSashikunt. nutl [ um running for SGA, VicesPi‘csldcllt.

I am a sophomore nnd art undccllucd mnjoi. l have served us Rnwson'. scnntoi
for the last yctu; and I also sen ed on the Comrtnllcc on Student Life and Publicity
Committee. I feel Ulttt Student Government is very important because it is the best
way to express the mic sis of the students to the faculty. trtlrninistratron. anti mists
ees. However. if students zircn't involved. then SGA. ctin‘t accurately initkc dccis
sions that reﬂect what you want SGA. has to be the active voice that convinces the
trustees to endorse issues that tut: important to the student body. such as Space Now
you‘re staning to wonder about what this gtiy wants to do for you. which is n \t’lild
question.

Herc are my five goals:

1) Increase the interaction between SGA and students. After thinking about the
role of the Vice-President. I realized that it lot of students don‘t know who lczids
SGA. Although first years heai' a shoit talk from the cabinet. they don‘t actually got
to speak with them. I feel thtit the President and Vlccsl’Icsitlcnl should meet with
groups of ﬁrst years in order to explain and discuss the concept of sclllgoverilancc
and SGA‘s role.

2) Intemcuon between the students turd lhc unslces. 'Ilic uustccs choose the
direction that the school takes; therefore. they should be in touch with the wide range
of students' opinions and conccms to help choose the right path. We iriusi continue
to build upon the relations that this year‘s SGA. lenders have mental in order to
ensure that the trustees listen in our voice more often. especially when it comes to
creating a new student center:

3) Sci up a contritntoe to look til gen! and tr tin Over the last two) it s.
I have rcalizcd that Grinnell is a very dil cull school. hill the outside world doesn't
take this into account duo to a lack of information I think that we should look at
how to improvclmnscrlpts so that graduate schools and purspcctivc criiployols know
how difﬁcult and challciigmg Grlnlrcll i.

4) Lab credit for students who take ti scrcnt couisc Two yc . igo. tho SGA.

Grinnell I have tried to do exactly
what I couldn’t do in N.Y.7 build a

Being a Senator this year has taught
me the full meaning of selfrgoverr

ated my independent major in Inter-
