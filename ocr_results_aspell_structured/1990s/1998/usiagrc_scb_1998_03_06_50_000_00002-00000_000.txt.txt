DISCO continued from

betng provided by the SGA.

Although there are mixed opin-
ions about it, Disco is still consid-
ered by many to be the biggest party
on campus, People invite their
friends and signiﬁcant others, while
alumni make it a point to come back
to Grinnell to witness the passing on
of the great silver cucumber and to
take part in the Disco fest. “I'm go-
ing to get up on Saturday morning
and immediately start playing disco
music," said Gigi Ryce ‘00.

Laura Harris ‘01 claimed that she
“can't wait to get drunk and stare at
multtrcolored lights," whilst Matt
Pellowski ‘01 thinks it will “give me
a chance to Shake my groove thang!"

On the other hand, not everybody
loves to get funky. Spencer Piston
‘01 said. “ I'm kind ofscared because
when people disco,I get poked in the
eye!"

“I didn't go to Disco last year and
I probably won't go to Disco this
year either," said Jamal Rogers '01.
“Disco epitomizes all the things
about campus parties that I dislike
such as the drunkenness, the loud-

ness and the
lewdness."

siasts, how-
ever. the

mood.

As Disco is
clearly not for
everyone, the
men who stuff '
their crotches
have some
p r o p h e t i c
words to
share 7 “The

assisted by the CDO when applying
for the program. Her internship was
made possible with the help of a
Wilson Grant which covered living
costs, she said.

“I think internships are valuable
because they give you a taste of the
‘rcal world‘ we like to theorize
[about] So much here at Grinnell,"
said Fowles. .

heard today: “Ain‘t 1 a woman?"
African Americans and other women
ofcolor have felt left out ofthe femi-

to unify these different faces of femi-
nism.

Toledo said, “Either we become
more diverse or we don’tthn’vet . .we
must achieve inclusiveness,” She
believes that though there is yet
much work to be done, Women are

Because students stay at Grinnell for
about four years, she said, they may
not see the breadth of policy shifts.
“But if you look at Grinnell overthe
last 10 years. you see major changes
with which SGA was involved, in-
cluding [student] involvement on
more committees and multicultural
space."

Current SGA vice president
Rebecca Eilers ‘98 agreed. noting
that “Multicultural space was a con-

Colors and Allies Summit on Feb.
20-22, Toledo seeks to improve unity
within the feminist movement. But
aside from increased diversity and
more unity. Toledo hopes to spread
the idea of“empowering ourselves."
Among other goals. she strives for
feminists to “elect ourselves," in»
stead of supporting already estab-
lished candidates in political elecr
Lions.

In order to cause change, Toledo
emphasized the grassroots approach.
”The thing that really matters is what

way." She noted that other issues
did, however, seem new: “Core valr
ues and concerns with excellence are
a new thing. Also, the issue of the
trustees is a bigger deal, [although]
Erin and I also worked on [the is-
sue].“

For some students, the issues dis
cussed mattered less than the repur
tation of the each candidate. Alaethia
Doctor ‘00 said, “It came down to
who I talked to and whose names I
knew. Iliked the people who seemed
genuine,,.and who were personable
and didn‘tjust stick Willi one crowd"

Other students also emphasized
character. Drehobl said, “I Went for
the more dynamic candidates":

Thomas said, “I don‘t see this as
an issue-by—issue election where I
vote for candidates because of their

platforms. I see it as, do I want to
elect a candidate who is more inside
or outside the process? What’s rev
ally important to me is whether the
candidate is in contact with a lot of
groups around campus and has an
overall interest in what people have
to say."

Ballots were cast Wednesday in
the post ofﬁce all day until 4 and at
dining halls during dinner. Of presi-
dential candidates, Dari Donaldson
‘00 received 18% of the vote,
Klaetsch received 36%, and Elina
Koretsky received 41%. In addition,
5% of votes went to write-in candi»
date Jon Maybanks ‘00. Among can-
didates for Vice President/FAA,
Dvorak, LaPuma and Samir
Sashikant '00 received 35%, 39%
and 25% 0f the vote respectively.
