BY NICHOLAS JOHNSON
Sports Writer

This week's- )oeks Can Talk features Amy
Walters '01. Amy is a three—sport athlete: she
plays soccer, basketball and runs track. sliewas
recently named eo-conftrcnctsoecer player of
the year.

5&1}; Hi,Amy. To srart our, can you give
a brief synopsis oryour life.

Amy: sure. 1 actually grew up in Minne-
sota, in a suburb right outside of Minneapo-
Its—Hopkins, Minnesota. I’ve lived there all
my life. 1 went to public high sehool and played
all three sports there: basketball. soccer and
track I'vc bctn involved In those since I was
very young. lplaycd all three at the wusity level,
I have 2 Sister, a mom and dad. I have two
goldcn rctricvers, which are my life, Thunder
and Lightening are their names, and I love ’cm
to death. My sister actually graduated from
Grinncll in ’97. I came hcrc when she left, so
we haven’t been here at the same time.That’s
how 1 found out about the college. Then she
graduated and 1 came here; ever since my dogs
have become [my parents] lifemdntl mine as
well. My parents have been great. 1 could go
ofrand talk about them forever. As far as sup.
port for what they’ve done for me athletically,
acadcmicnlly and raising mysister and I, they’re
great. They‘re loyal supporters ofall of my
teams here at Grinncll, It’s about a four hour
drive from Minneapolis, and they come down
all the time to watch soccer games and basket»
ball games. Thcy’rc favorites on the team. Be
cause the come so often, everyone knows who
they arc. So they’re good supporters.

5&3: Your basketball season has just got»
ten underway What will the season be like
this ycar? '

Amy: It’s hard to say. We’ve lost a lot of
players from last year for various reasons. Last
year we went for a rebuilding season as far as
rebuilding from pasrycars. We had three ﬁrst»
years on the starting squad last year. This year
we've had a change in personnel; we have some
brand new people coming in andwe had some
people leave. It’s almost like another rebuilds
ing year for us. I have alororconﬁdenee. We're
small in numbers but,..My favorite quote is
that we're small in quantity but huge in qual-
ity, We don't have a lot of players, but quality»
wise, it’s there. Tire key to the season is going
to be conditioningiwc have so few players
that we'll have a small amount ofplayers who
get a lot of playing time. If they’re going to
stay in the game for a long time, they're going
to have to be in shape. were going to have to
be able to run the floor and to stay long min
utes in the game. So that’s going to be a key to
the season—conditioningandstaying in shape
for the games. other than that, we have two
solid post players, and 1 play one ofrhe wings,
so we have two big post players that are going
to be able to be competitive with anyone in
the conference. I don't know what to say about
our outlook, but I'm conﬁdent, I think it’sjust
going to com: down to having a lot ofheart
and playing hard at practices and wanting it
more than the other team.

5&8: What are your goals, both personal
and for the team, for the season?

Amy: ..,I guess for personal
goals...obviously I’d like to continue to try and
get all conference again. But 1 think before any
personal goals this year, 1 think it's going to be
a lot more important to go for our team goals
because of the personnel that we have and what
we're going through as a team. 1 think that if
we can accomplish a lot of team goals, per—
sonal goalswill automatically follow alongwith
that. 1 think irwe can get the team to win some
games, ifwe can get the team functioning as a
core often players..,the 1 think my individual
goals will follow that. I think ill get one, the
Dilltl will Comc right along wllh it.

8&B: You said that the (cam is suffering
from small numbers this year. Hus having so
few players greatly affected the tem, or have
the players been able to overcome it?

Amy: It’s still curly in the season, so it's Still
too early to tcll. But I think that what has af»
fectcd the team the most IS thzu WC have such
a new mix' of playctsil'm probilbly going to
get this wrong so I should think ilbullr ltﬁl
thinl: rhcrc’s four players that wcrt on (Ill: tctim
lost your and that played togcrhur. Compare-d
to having tcn on the team, that's 1ch [him half.

So 1 think what's going to be the biggest ob—
Stﬂcle for us to get around is the fact that we
don’t have a solid ﬁve people that have played
together in the past. What's going to be our
biggest goal is to learn each othcr’s playing
styles, adjust to the way that we can feed off
each other} skills, We have to learn how to
read each other’s wants, likes and dislikes on
the court and offthe court. So I think what
has affected us the most so far is just having
to put asidcso much time in the beginning to
learning how our different playing styles are
and how we can cater to those needs and get
those to corrclaic with each other

As far as numbcrs, I guess it has affected
our practices a lot. In the beginning, we didn‘t
have ten: we had two players that were still in
volleyball. So in the beginning we wcrc prac-
ticing sometimes with eight players, So we
couldn’t go fiveronrfivcsprinting up and down
thc floor. We couldn't go live-on-f‘lvc to work
on defensive skills. That aliectcd us a lot. What
we’re doing now is actually bringing in some
guys, some male soccer players and some other
guys, who are willing to scrimmage with us.
We do that about two times a week just to get
up and down the court and to gct someone
else to play against us. It saves our brcath so
to speak and gets some subs in instcad ofjust
playing nonsstop. I think [[hc lack of num»
bcrsl has affected us that way. But I think if
anything it might bring us closer. 1fthere is a
smaller number ofpeople, we’re going to have
to rely on each other 2 lot more. I can scc that
happening already.

5&3: When you’re not working at one of
your three sports, what sons of things do you
enjoy?

Amy: Here at Grinncll? Here at Gtinncll,
since I’m playing three sports a year, it seems
like I’m almys either on the field, on the court,
working or at class. A lot of people ask me
that: how can you do it, how can you do three
sports and be at a competitive school like
Grinncll? But it helps me manage my time,
honestly. I couldn’t do it any other Way. It has
never crossed my mind to quit one, it's never
crossed my mind to take a season off, it's never
crossed my mind to go abroad and miss one
season, I couldn’t bring myself to do it. IfI
had to choose one sport to qui never, in my
life. Our orthe three 1 can't pick one. 1 always
say my favorite sport is the season that I’m in
at that time. So right now, it's baskctball. If
you’d asked me a month ago, it'would have
been soccer and in the spring it will be track. _
Obviously it feels like I don’t have a lot ofﬁce.
time between [sports] and work, but it doesn’t
bother me. Because ifI’rn not working, I'd like
to be playing basketball or I’d like to be play»
ing soccer. That’s whcrc I like to spend all my
time. .

Other than that, what do I do? Here at
Grinncll, not much elscimostly hanging out
with fricnds, But ifI’m at home, I'm spcnd-
ing quality time with my puppies romping
around with our dogs at home and with my
sister. My sisters the love of my life, 1 guess
you could say. Since she graduated from here,
she visits a lot, Those are my favorite weak-
ends in the world, when shc comes and I get
to spend time with her and she comes to my
games and supports me and we hang out (0-
gether. Ifwe could be, wc’d b: joincd at the
hip...

88:82 Great. I think that’s about all I have
for you. Is there anything else?

Amy: Arc we going to talk about soccer at
all?

5&5: We can talk about whatever you
want to.

Amy: Actually, 1 thought that's what the
intcrvrcw would be about. I just ‘fnund
our..,that 1 was named :trconfcrcncc player
ofrhc year for soccer....l can’t saycnough about
thc soccer team. On the ﬁeld I jusr enjoyed it
so much... "

S& . Excellent. is there anything else?

Amy: You start me on sports and I’ll just
sit hcrc all night and never shut up.

$5413: I’ll just give you the tape recorder
and a few extra tapes.

Amy' I’ll be talking all night long. Scy-
cnth grade, my track season...
