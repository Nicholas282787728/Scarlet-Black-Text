Tornadoes Kill at Least 42 in U.S.

Tornadoes tipped a deadly path through the southeast»
ern United States early Thursday, killing at least 42 people
and hitting some areas wnh tlte force of a bomb blast.
At least 32 people died in Alabama, most of thetn in
Jefferson County west ofthc city ofBirmingham, where
hoiites splintered like matcliwood and trees flew through
the air like toothpicks Georgia reported at least eight
and possibly 12 dead, while one person was killed in
Mississippi and a soldier on n pie-dawn run was struck
by lightning in North Carolina as the storm system bar-
reled northeast toward the Atlantic Ocean. President
Clinton, speaking in Kentucky, declared major disaster
areas in the worst-hit parts ofAlahama and Georgia and
commiscraicd with residents' “terrible losses." “Theloss
oflife is overwhelming,"Alabama Gov, Fob James said,
“It’s the worst storm I've seeti in my lifetime,"

Northern Ireland Peace Deal Soon

John Taylor, deputy leader ofthe Ulster Unionist Party,
said earlier today an agreement was in sight in Northern
Ireland peace talks, but it could take another five hours.
“Certainly we are well on our way towards an agree.
ment," Taylor told reporters after negotiations dragged
on past a midnight deadline. Taylor's remarks directly
contradicted comments from the Irish Republican Army‘s
Sinn Feiii political \ving, Whose chairman Mitchel
McLaughlin said only a few minutes earlier that he could
see no speedy end to the talks, Taylor said talks chair-
man George Mitchell was preparing a ﬁnal draft of a
new peace agreement, which would have to be discussed
by all the parties. “I can see this going on for another
three, four, perhaps five hours," Taylor said. The Ulster
Unionists, the province’s biggest prorEritish party, have
been locked itt months of bitter dispute with nationalist
parties who want closer political links with Dublin to
reﬂect their Irish identity.

Over 100 Die in Haj Stampede

More than 100 Muslim pilgrims were crushed to death
in a stampede at the ha) pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia yes-
terday, the last ofﬁcial day ofthe sacred Islamic rite. The
official Saudi Press Agency quoted a statement from he]
security forces as saying the stampede occurred in the
plain ofMena, where large crowds ofpilgrims assembled
near a bridge on their way to a ntual in Jamraat where
they symbolically stone the devil, “This afternoon at
around 12.40 pm, the time when large numbers of pi]—
grims were headed to... the area of Mena, there was se
vere crowding east of the bridge in which several eldr
erly and ill pilgrims fell," the statement said. “The secue
rity forces present there in large numbers exerted ex-
uaordinary efforts to save them. But the enormous crowds
overﬂowing to Jamraat caused the death of a number
estimated at 107 pilgrims, according to an initial count,"
it said. The stampede apparently occurred in the same
area in which 270 people were crushed in another ha]
stampede iii 1994. After the 1994 stampede, Saudi au-
thorities doubled the width of the 0.6 Jamraal bridge,
from which pilgrims stone the pillars, to 280 feet. More
than l.7 million pilgrims from lOO Countries this year
performed haj, one of the pillars of the Islamic faith.

UN Court Urges U.S. To Halt Execution

The World Court called on the United States Thursday
to stay the execution of a Paraguayan sex attacker and
murderer due to die by lethal injection next week in a
Virginia prison. Angel Francisco Breard was sentenced
to death in "1993 for the attempted rape and subsequent
murder ofa woman neighbor in Arlington, Virginia, Para~
guay asked the United Nations' highest court to stop the
execution, "scheduled for next Tuesday, on the grounds
that Breard was denied access to consular officials dur-
ing his detention, in breach oftlte 1963 Vienna Conven-
tiori. Earlier this week, Paraguay told the court that
Breard was badly advised by defense lawyers who failed
to grasp the cultural differences between Us, and Para.
guayan law. Before his trial, Ereard rejected a plea bar~
gain that would have resulted in life itnprisonment,
choosrng instead to take the stand, admit his guilt and
throw himself on thejury’s mcrcy. He claimed he had
acted under a curse.

Presidential Candidates To Visit Campus

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

As pan ofthe ongoing search for a new
Grinnell College president, the Presiden-
tial Search Committee will host candi-
dates later in April,

The committee “is planning opportu-
nities for candidates to meet with stu-
dents,” said Professor of Economics Irene
Powell, a faculty representative on the
Search Committee. She encouraged feed-
back, saying, “All of the campus reprer
sentatives are extremely encouraging
about students talking with them about
any concerns that they have.”

The committee hopes to present a list
of nominees selected from the 250 cur
rent candidates to the Board of Trustees
during this month's Board meeting.

The Ceminittee conducted off-Silt: in-
terviews with malty of the candidates in
March, and plans to continue interviews
this month.

The Search Committee is dedicated to
finding the best candidates, and is not rc-
strained by a strict time line. SGA Presi-
dent Ertn Childress ‘98, the student rep-
resentative on the committee said, “It’s
important to be flexible in [this] process."
Furthermore, Childress said that the come
niittee would present candidates to the
Board “only if [We] believe in them
wholeheartedly. , .The goal is to find the
right person not by [a certain date], but
just to find the right person."

Professor Powell agreed. “[We’re] try-
ing to be ﬂexible and thorough." she said

The Search is all the more important
because of Grinnell’s economic and edu-

cational strengths. “1 think the most im
portant aspect [of the search],‘-‘ said
alumni representative Patricia Finkelman
‘80, “is the timing of the search at this
unique point in Grinnell's history, The
strength of the faculty, students, admin-
istratiott, attd alumni, in combination with
an endowment unmatched among colr
leges the size ofCrinnell presents a unique
set ofopportunities and challenges for the
next President.”

The Search Committee appointed to
select Grtnnell's next President draws
from all types of people afﬁliated with
Grinttell College. Thc committee consists
of ei ght trustees, four faculty, one student,
one alumnus, and one administrator,
Ftnkelman said, “The fact that the search
committee includes representatives of so
many constituencies. . .gives us a very

broad picture of what type of President
will best suit Grinnell."

Committee members agreed upon the
importance of communication in the pro-
cess, not only within the group but with
the world at large. Professor Elizpbeth
Dobbs, a faculty representative, cited the
Grinnell College website as an important
means by which alumni can view the
progress from anywhere in the world.

Powell elaborated: “[We‘re] trying to
be as open as possible to the whole com-
munity while maintaining conﬁdential-
ity for the candidates." She also noted
communication within the committee:
“So far all committee members have had
a good working relationship with each
other.“

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

The Grinnell College Stonewall Coa-
lition [StoneCo] is gearing up for the 1998
Pride Week celebrated April 13-13.

“[Pride Week is to] celebrate GLBT
(Gay-Lesbian-Bisexuaermnsgendered)
people and their conn‘ibutions to society,”
said Sarah Fowles ‘98. Pride Week Come
mittee Coordinator.

Pride Week begins on Monday, April
13, with a designated “Day of Silence."
Fowles explained: “[It] demonstrates the
silence that has traditionally surrounded
sexuality and alternate lifestyles. . .and to
recognize those people that are silenced.
. .to show solidarity with those people."

Throughout the week, StoneCo will
present speakers who are “leaders within
the GLBT movement in America," said
Fowles. Especially notable are Craig
Hickman, Leslea Newman, and Loraine
Hutchins.

Craig Hickman, a performance artist

from Boston, will present “Portraits of a
Black Queen" on Friday, April 17.
Hickman, whom Fowles describes as
“crazily intelligent," integrates the issues
of race, gender, sexuality, and drag into
his art. Hickman’s performance is co
sponsored by Concerned Black Students
[CBS].

Leslea Newman, a writer, will speak
about “Living as a Jewish Lesbian." On
Thursday, April 16, Newman will first
present an infon'nal talk at 4230. At 8 in
the evening, she will read from one of her
latest novels and discuss issues of butch/
femme. As well as novels, Newman has
written controversial children’s books
about lesbianism. Fowles described her

5 “outspoken, dynamic, and opinion-
atcd."

Loraine Hutcliins, also a writer, will
give a talk entitled “Coming Out Loud and
Proud, Bisexual Identity: Stereotypes vs.
Realities," on Tuesday, April 14. Fowles
mentioned reading Hutchins’ book in high
school and ﬁnding it “the first book with

c l e a r
themes.“

Organizations Network Out Of State

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Contributing Writer

Grinnell College organizations are
leaving the campus in efforts to transcend
some of the difficulties 3 rural locale
poses.

The Students’ Organization of Latinos/
as [SOL], Habitat for Humanity [Habir
tat], Free the Planet [FTP] and the Envi-
ronmental Action Group [EAG] all chose
to leave Iowa last week in effons to build
networks and focus on group needs.

The purpose of the Collegiate Leaderr
ship Network, attended by members of
SOL was “to aid in the national network
ing of the ﬁnest Latino/a American minds
in the country...[so they might] serve as
leaders and organizers not only of their

campus organizations, but of the Latino
community as well," said Nicolas
Schapira ‘01, next year‘s SOL president,

The foureday conference was orga-
nized to include workshops in leadership
skills as well as panels of Latino organi-
zation leaders. From these worksltops and
panels, SOL members learned about
“community building, creation ofwealth,
equity, dividends in the organization,
good campus structures, and how to in-
crease Latino entrepreneurship within the
Latino community."

The Habitat for Humanity conference
was also concerned with building com»
munity, but inaslightly moreliteral sense.
One central function of Habitat for Hu»
manity, an international organization
spanning 58 countries, is to “build low-

cost, quality homes and allow
homeowners to [buy the homes at cost,
paying] at whatever rate they can afford,"
according to chapter president Erin Hust-
ings ‘98.

Each campus chapter is linked to a lo-
cal afﬁliate; while the campus chapters
concern themselves with helping to “edu-
cate surrounding communities about pov-
erty housing issues and to build decent,
affordable housing," the afﬁliate head-
quarters “handle all the details ofcontracts
with homeowners, insurance, raising
money, coordinating volunteers, and so
on,"

Nebraska, was organized by HFH Inter-
national and the campus chapter at Wayne

Increased
Student Aid
Rejected

BY LISA REGELMAN
University of Virginia Staff Writer
(UWIRE) - Partisan politics are at the

center of yet another education battle.

The heart of the debate lies in the US.
Senate’s ﬁscal year 1999 budget resolu-
tion r with party Republicans receiv-
ing criticism from both Democrats and
student lobbyists for not supporting
President Bill Clinton‘s February budget
proposal. The proposal would fund new
education initiatives and an increase in
programs such as Pell Grants and col-
lege work study.

The budget proposal, an outline for
government spending for fiscal year 1999
beginning October 1, was passed Thurs-
day by a 56-44 vote by the Senate Bud-
get Committee.

“If you look at the budget resolution,
it has absolutely no funding for any of
the President‘s resolutions," said Julie
Green, spokeswoman for U.S. Secretary
of Education Richard W. Riley. “There
is deﬁnitely a discrepancy in the Senate‘s
budget and the President’s. "

Clinton‘ s proposal calls for a $150
million increase in Pell Grant support,
to a new total of $7.594 billion. The pro—
posal also sets a $70 million funding in»
crease for Federal Work Study Program
funding, up from this year's $900 mil-
lion.

The Senate's budget proposal allo-
cates $249 million less for Pell Grants
than the President's proposal, and $70
million less for college work study,

A decrease in Pell Grant funding
would also affect a large number of Uni-
versity students, ofﬁcials said.

In a Saturday press release, Commit-
tee member Senator Pete V. Domenici,
R»NM, defended the Republican pro-
posal and said Clinton ignored his origi-
nal education commitments in favor of
newer programs. V
