So far this year,' the main
goal of ionchrisrinauriah has
simply been to and the time
to get together to practice. “I
think we are going to try to do
a couple performances this

year," says bassist Christina-

Hanson, ‘01, “we haven’t had
a chance to play together _ it
would be nice to get together
to see where out playing is at."

Jonchrisrinauriah, as the
name suggests, consists orthtee
members, “Jon (Coffin ‘01)
plays guitar, chrisrina plays
bass, and I play my mouth,"
says Uriah Melchizedek, ‘01.
The sound ofrhe group is dif-
ficult to classify neatly. “We
got the name ‘spoken word
acoustic which is pretty accu»
rate, but iris hard to define,"
says Hanson, “I drink theway
we play depends on how we
feel about the song at die mo-
ment _ it goes between folk
and blues a lot, and sometimes
it does get a little more like
rock, though without a drum.

 

mer or electric it doesn't quite
reach rock."

“I have no idea how to really
describe our sound..,“ says
Melchizedek, “...it changes from
song to song."

For the most part,
jonchristinauriah performs
original works. “Ifwc’rc mak»
ing an original song, I’ll write the
lyrics, then Jon and Christina
will improv the music,” says
Melchizedek. “We've used the
works of poets like ee cummings,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Langston
Hughes...But mostly we do
original works." The group fea.
tured one cover last year, ”E»how
the Letter" by R.E.M. at a Bob's
performance.

Jonchristinauriah began last
year, like so many things do, at
Quad Dining Hall. “We formed
as a group when I metlon while
working at Quad early last year,”
says Melehizedek. “When he
told me that he played rhe'hand
drum. I asked him ifhe would
consider doing a kind of heat-
nik poetry thing at a Open Mic
at Bob’s some time or another,
and he was inrerested. Christina
we in my tutorial, and some.
body told me that she played
bass. So when I saw her in line
at Quad one day i asked her if
she would be interested in play»
ing sometime, and she was. A
few days later we got together at
the Fine Arts Building, and from
then on we played a couple of
times a week ”

Camaradetie, as well as mu»
sical creativity, seems to be the
adhesive keeping
jonchrisrinauriah together. “I
like playing with such creative
people," says Hanson.

Mclchizedek agrees, al»
though humbly: “I like the fact
that I have no musical talents
whatsoever yet I get to be in a
band with two highly talented
musicians and play fun music.”
Jan likes the informal attitude of
the band. “I like being part ofa
band that doesn’t take itself too
seriously, but is at the same time

concerned with sounding do»
cent, This attitude allowed us
to improvise and experiment
with our music which is what
I have always been interested
in, I liked the idea of our
lnusic being more ofa pro
cess that people witnessed
rather than a set product of
intense rehearsing."

The main frustration
ionchtistinauriali faces as a
campus band is the lack of
support for local music by
the campus community. “1
think it's frustrating that
there’s so little support for
campus hands out there,“
says Melchizedek. “I hear
people, bitching about the
music scene here and how in
general there’s nothing to do,
Well, make your own band,
or at least support those who
have, I don’t think people
realize that a show is a two
way street; the bands will play
better and more often if [heyc
have better

Suppoﬂ’fl'om the crowds
at their shows,"

Cofﬁn, on the other
hand, doesn’t associate such
frustrations with the band.
“Perhaps if I took the idea of
ionchristinauriah as being a
campus band more seriously,
lwould be annoyed about it
more. As it is, I’m not an-
noyedbyanythingaboutbe-
ing a band at Grinnell. In
fact, I don't even really think
of us as a band. I consider
Christina and Uriah to be a
couple ofpeople With whom
I enjoy playing music. lguess
I’m pretty laid back about
jonehristinautiah.”

Jonchtistinauriah cut-
renrly has no set dates for
performances. “We don’t re-
ally know when we’ll be play-
ing next, but we know for
sure that we’ll be playing at
the Hub music festival in
January," says Melchizedek,

musicians, practice their music
and perform their music for
other crinnell students.

According to Shelton,
free-sound is an idea whose time
is long ovordiie. “jessc, Paul and
I were kind of disillusioned
about thelackofmusic here We
hope to serve as a catalyst for
more music," he said,

McClelland agreed. ”From
my perspective," he said, “there
isn't enough music produced by
crinnell students for crinnell
students. There is a lot more to
be had here,"

McClelland’s concern has
given the three the overriding
goal for frecsound: to help bring
more musicby crinnell students

to criruiell students,

To accomplish this goal, the
three are first seeking SGA ap-
proval and funding. Once this
initial step is out of the way,
freesound will then serve as an
organization to help campus
musicians reach their goals by
providing as much or as little
help as the musicians want,

Shelton explained that
frccsound could provide this
help in several ways, He said he
and his two colleagues are plan-
ning to create a list orall musi-
cians on campus to facilitate the
forming ofgmnps,

“We want to compile a list
of musicians on campus who
want to explore ‘extratpcrsonal'
music options," Chaikin said.
This list could aid musicians
looking to form groups by help
ing them find other musicians

levels.

Also, the founders of
freesound hope to acquire per»
formance equipment, such as a
public address system, for musit
cians to use and to help campus
musicians find venues in which
they can perform.

Although freesound wants to
help musicians as much as it can,
Shelton stressed thathe does not
want to force the organization
on anyone. “This whole organi.
zarion is about information,” he
said. “We want to provide help
(to musicians) ifthey need it. I
want this to be something from
which people can take as much
or as little as they want."

McClelland added, “We
want people to develop their
sound, their way. We want
freesound to be musician-
friendly"

The founders of freesound
hope the sounds that will the
velop will be varied.

“Anyone is welcome (in the
group)," shelton said. “string
quartets to funk bands. People
who want to sing showtunes.
Anyone."

While the groups short term
goals are fairly well developed,
the three's eventual goals are
much more vague, and lofrier.
The three said they eventually
hope to equip a house in
crinnell with recording equip»
ment and practice rooms for
musicians' use (although shelton
stressed the optimal words in
this goal are “hope to")

shelton said that the groups
ultimate goal for the organim»
tion is “to create a unique, stue
dent.run organism—a unique
program that will strategically
enhance Grinnell College."

Chaikin, McClelland and
shelton all said that freesound
is still a “freeform” idea right
now and said they would love
input from anyone on campus.
To inquire or comment about
freesound, the three asked you
