Jazz Joint

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

Charlie is facing somejail time for
marijuana possession. over an ounce,
it’s a felony.

Charlie's not a dealer or a pusher,
he’s a distributor. He carries mari-
juana between cities, from those who
have to those who want. It is not his
living. it is not the entirety ofhis life,
it is something he does so that those
who want to can get high. Charlie’s
a model citizen to some folks.

Other folks who move marijuana
are dealers and pushers, they are in
the business. For them it is proﬁt,
free drugs free money. and the only
cost the exploitation of their friends
and their greater community. They
add a little something to the price ex~
plaining that they are taking the risk,
doing the work. Charlie believes ev-
eryone in a community has a role to
play, that everybody has to make sac-
riﬁces for the beneﬁt of the commu-
nity. He belongs to the pot smoking
community though he is aware that
he is a member of other larger com—
munities. He knows his friends are
poor and that they can hardly justify
paying for pot at all let alone paying
market driven plices. He kicks down,
adding travel expenses to the cost,
but basically he pays what everyone
else pays. Charlie doesn’t believe in
exploitation. He knows that the cir
cumstances which grant him the
means and opportunity to make a
proﬁt do not dictate that he must
make a proﬁt, he knows that in other
circumstances he is on the losing end.
Charlie’s whole life is built upon cree
ating equity amongst individuals, he
knows that the whole American capi»
talist system is designed to allow
those with means to take advantage
of those without the means, so his
act of social conscience is to not exe
ploit the means he has.

When those other folks get busted,
the community does little to rally for
them. It is business that way. The
community has paid for bail and trial
in the inﬂated price. If it is business
then the consumer has fulﬁlled his
end and has no obligation to help the
dealer. If it is strictly a market issue
then another supplier will come

along and the role will be filled.
There is no shortage ofpeople in this
world waiting to get a chance to exe
ploit others.

When Charlie wears the cuffs it is
another issue. It can not be said that
his community would lend any more
support. ﬁnancial or otherwise, but
it creates a clearer picture of the unr
just nature of the marijuana laws in
this country. It makes outrage pos
sible. When people like Charlie get
busted, laws are brought into ques
tion. It is very difﬁcult to defend a
dealer who exploits his friends and
creates economic hardship amongst
his community. But with Charlie,
who does not do this, who does not
sell to children, who does not take
food stamps for drugs, who merely
provides a product for those who
want the product, it is strictly an is-
sue of whether marijuana is more
dangerous than cigarettes and beer,
the legal dmgs. Charlie understands
that the responsibility belongs to the
pot smoking community to prove
that they are not a threat to the valr
ues and moral standing ofa commue
nity. It is their responsibility to prove
that this drug is not responsible for
society's ills. it is not the job oflaw
enforcement to come around, nor is
it the responsibility ofmis-educated
scared parents to see through the
glossy eyed looks of their children
into the kind serene thoughts of their
mind. He understands that this is not
fair, that Nike and Starter have not
been made to prove that their shoes
and attire are not responsible for the
gang violence associated with them,
that GM is not held responsible for
the economic and social fall ofFlint,
Michigan. Pot is a scapegoat, but that
does not mean it is without problems.
There is addiction, there is violence
associated with its trade, but these
issues can not be blamed solely on
the dmg itself. It is the system which
makes this an unregulated black mar-
ket. The system contributes to addic-
tion, the system alone is responsible
for the violence. it is the system that
creates the attitudes which dominate
the trade. Capitalism will play no role
in the salvation of this world, but
within it is the seed of its destruc-
tion. As consumers we have the right
to demand an end to exploitation, but
it is unrealistic to believe that those
with the means will bend to strip
themselves of their power. Charlie
knows that the future of the capital»
ist world is dependent on the produc-
ers and suppliers. He does what he
can to make things better.

Should Charlie g0 tojail?...Hell no!

Should those other dealers go
jail?...0nly if they share a cell with
Phil Knight and Bill Gates.

 

Letters

, to the editor

To the Campus Community,

O.K. hello peoples, I’m writing
over here from Glasgow, the city that
reeks of random shags and bad Brit.
Pop music, I am hoping this makes
it through all the smut and gets to
you. I am the concerts chair for next
year, that dreaded job where all
people manage to do is sh — urinate
(self-censoring) upon you whenever
possible (nothing like being a pessir
mist). Basically, Ihate spotlights, but
I love music and it will be totally
brilliant if the music scene kicks next
year. So I am hoping everyone, not
just those elitist fucked up few, like
myself, will give input on who they
want to see for next year. And if you
don’t give me input, man, I know
who I want, I want like trillions of
Ska bands to invade campus. You
know, like those parachutlng Rus-
sians in the movie “Red Dawn," and
I want them to fucking waste us with
their pathetic beats. Right, so get up
off your burns, rumps, burns (I try to
stay away from the swearing) and
write me with who you want.

It don‘t matter who you are - you
could be the guy or gal who got re~
jected from a prissy little ivy league
school still hoping they can be presi-
dent by the time I’m 30. So, in that
casejust tell me you want Mozart to
come to increase your brain size, or
whatever his music’s supposed to do.
You could be tripping on grandma’s
shrooms. and suddenly your fuzzy
fuzzy couch becomes like a fucking
pet dog or something, butjust wake

up for a second, right, and tell me
that Bjork‘s Telegraph album is
weirding you out and you want
something to make your dmgged out
haze more enjoyable. For those of
you waking up early on Saturday
mornings, as smiling tired kids roll
into your laps ready to paint their
imaginations, ask the kids to write
me. I‘ve always thoughtMr. Rogers
had peculiar cutting edge vocal har-
mony. Or those rugby players, just
break from the scrum, say fuck the
team, and go to the computer lab and
write me. Idon’t know what you're
into, but whatever you're into is not
the point. The point is I need you to
tell me who you want.

Currently, I have not yet gotten the
list ofbands that will be touring next
fall, but the semester's almost over
and this is one of my ﬁnal chances
to get your input. I would like to
have something to work with when I
get back in July, so write me with a
list of the bands that you would like
to come to Grinnell and play. Also,
if you have any other ideas like a
battle of the bands or beneﬁt concert,
let me know. I promise that at the
beginning of next semester I will
fully outline my plan to you on what
I hope to accomplish with concerts
next year. First step though is get»
ting your input.

Cheers.

don i you pick on someone else? - L

Dear Lizz,

We‘re sick ofyou making fun ofus.
Just because we are the most beauti-
ful girls on this campus and every
boy wants to ”get to know us," you
and all your friends think that they
have a light to comment on how we
dress or act or whatever. And we
mean WHATEVER. Well, you're
wrong. We have had to hear this crap
all damn year and it’s going to end,
right now. We‘re sick of people call-
ing us “the skanky spices” or “mule
faced" or “Tori Spelling - like."
There is nothing wrong with hiding
behind an inch of makeup everyday,
throwing yourself at boys, giggling
at the library, or pretending to be
Eurotrash. Give us some respect
dammit.

Dear Editor,

We would like to thank all of our
fans, old and new, for attending the
concert at Harris this past Friday. It
was very rewarding and energizing
to see so many people at the show
having a good time and shakin' their
booties! Bumie Psykes 5 has been
kicking out numba onejams since its
origin in the fall of 1994, and we
have to thank our fans for the huge
amount of support that We have re-
ceived since we started playing. We
would also like to thank Gidra and
Mo’ Betta for playing and helping to
rock down the house at Harris.

We couldn’t have done it without
y‘all. It’s been a Wonderful time here
at Grinnell and We will soon be part-
ing and heading our separate ways,
but for now THE FIVE ARE
ALIVE!!! Keep your eyes and ears
open, we hope to be playing one
more show before the end of the
year...

Once again thank you all,

Burnie Psykes 5

CAMPUS MEDIATION

What ifthere was a forum in which
to resolve the controversy over Titu—
lar Head? What if those who have a
problem with the academic appeal
process actually had a way to initiate
change within the administration?
This semester in our Conﬂict Reso»
lution Seminar (SOC 390) we have
explored the ﬁeld ofmediation. Me-
diation is a process by which two or
more parties sit down in an effort to
communicate and resolve their prob-
lems, It is a fast growing ﬁeld still
being utilized in various areas such
as public policy, divorce, conﬂict in
schools, labor disputes, employee
grievances, enVlronmental issues,
wars, and international conﬂicts.

Dear Lizz,

Since I’ve been in Grinnell for 31*
most four years, I am no longer the
hip and trendy model of fashion I
once was. In fact, what I still think
is cool is now being sold at Walmart
in the discount bin. I’m graduating
in almost two weeks and will be
thrust into the cold and cruel outside
world. How can I prove to the pub
lic that I’m stylish on the inside, even
though the outside looks like 1994?

Dear Lizz,

I am a big stupid ﬁrst year. I think
that what I do is smart and creative.
Unfortunately, others don’t feel the
same way and like to heckle my art.
It huns me to hear someone criticize
what I spend hours and hours work-
ing on. I made a petition to stop the
hecklers and that just made them
laugh at me more. How do I win re-
spect for my creations among a group
of drunken critics?

resource on campus referred to as the
Office of Conununity Rights (OCR).
OCR is a mediation service within
Student Affairs that was developed
to deal with interpersonal conﬂicts
before they reached JUDCO. Two
RLCS and four student: facilitate dis-
cussion between parties in cases
where “there is a need for greater
understanding among the parties in-
volved in the conflict" (1997»1998
Student Handbook).

Unfortunately, this service is hardly
ever used by students. primarily be»
cause it is not publicized. As a class,
we have considered how to make the
OCR more accessible and practical
to students. The ﬁrst change that we
suggest is that OCR be renamed “Of—
free of Mediation Services" (OMS).
We believe that this is a more appro—
priate description of the services that
this group offers. The remainder of
our changes are more structurally
based.

First, we believe that the RLCs and
students should get special training
as mediators, possibly through the
Iowa Peace Institute (IPI) in
Grinnell, an organization that deals
with the education and practice of
mediation. With this training we also
suggest that there be an increase in
the number of students serving on the
committee Students would then be
able to choose from a pool of me,
diators. Having a choice would help
students feel more comfortable about
the process.

Further changes we suggest are to
make the OMS less focused on reso-
lution and to cut down the paper-
work. We believe that agreement
should be a result of the mediation
process, not a goal. Mediation is it
process that encourages discussion
and helps the parties to understand
both sides of the conﬂict; it is often
sufficient to lead to a resolution.
However, mediation can be compro-
mised if it is primarily gnakoriented.

OMS could be used by students to
mediate many different types of dis
putes among all levels and members
of the campus community. Media-
tion could be a beneficial precursor
to JUDCO: however, its a class we

I-Iercc We used to think the slo-
grin wzis “Where there’s helpful smile
in every aisle." No no. In truth, it is
“Where there's something smelly in
every dcli." That would be Erin. Oh
wait. That’s just at the Grinnell Hyv
Vce Deli.

We had a hard time deciding what
to eat, since there were more choices
than thcrc are copies of Link Magar
zinc on the post office floor. Ale
though the options paralyzed our
brains for a good 20 lninutes, the
people behind us politely reminded
us, via agentle tap ofa shopping cart
to the larynx, that we should order.

Erin got lhc lasagna plate, which
included a side of macaroni and
cheese. OR SO WE THOUGHT. In
fact, it was actually macaroni and
paste. “Hey, this reminds me of el-
ementary school,” said Erin glee-
fully. Everyonc at the table stopped
chewing and stared at her with dis-
gust, and then promptly reached over
to her plate for a bite.

Rebecca asked for the meatloaf,
rare. “It's just like mom used to
make," said Rebecca, adding that she
had been raised by wolves.

“ch! Whatacoincidence! It’sjust
like what MY mom used to make
when she went shopping at the Hy-
Vec Delil” exclaimed Erin.

After devouring her meatloaf,
Rebecca commented, “You know,
this would really be bland if it
weren‘t for the ketchup." Erin. who
had her fork poised over the
meatloaf, pulled it away, screaming,
“KETCl-IUP’H'! I think that’s a bit too
much for my taste buds." Rebecca
ignored Erin and moved on to the
other side dishes, which included the
au gratin potatoes (oddly enough,
they had the exact same texture, fla-
vor, and intriguing color as the maca-
roni and paste.) Her spring salad,
which included ample amounts of
spring, tasted like alfalfa and bullv
dozer dirt. Ironically, those were the
ingredients, Still, Rebecca ate it with
undisguised zeal. Erin stared at her,
asking ineredulously “Hungry?"

recognize that there are some issues
which are inappropriate for ‘media-
tion, such as sexual harassment cases
or cases dealing with speciﬁc legal
issues. These cases currently are, and
should remain, issues for IUDCO.
We are in the process of construct-
ing a proposal to modify the current
OCR into OMS. Reforming OCR
is a way for our student body to in-
crease their powers of self gover-
nance and determination. Through
mediation students will gain valuable
conﬂict resolution skills which are
beneﬁcial for all members of soci—
ety. Therefore, we encourage mem-
bers of the campus community to
make the OMS a practical reality.

To the Editor:

I was interested to read online your
article on the appeals process at
Grinnell, espectally where Off-Cﬂlﬂ~
pus Study is concerned. When I was
at Grinnell, 1 found it quite silly that
Iwas expected to pclilion and create
a whole “rationale" to be allowed to
study ahrond in France.

So, rather than saying all the
nainby-pamby meaningless cliches
that the committee requires, 1 there
fore said in my little essay that since
Grinnell had accepted us as students,
it didn't make sense to me that the
school should then fear that we might
be embarrassments when abroad.

I probably also said that since the
school considered off~campus study
a useful part of one‘s academic edu
cation, it didn’t make sense to me that

“Like the wolf," said Rebecca, mide
bite.

Erin was not so hungry, especially
after getting the cranberry marshmal-
low salad of pain and misfortune.
Rebecca reminded Erin after she had
ordered that she didn’t even like
marshmallows. “Oh,” said Erin
sadly. “And itdoesn’teven have any
meat in it."

“You ninny," said Rebecca, “that’s
because you got the VEGETARIAN
cranberry marshmallow salad. You
should have asked for the cranberry
marshmallow cold-cut combo
salad."

“Oh," said Erin again, dejectedly.

To conclude the meal, we went to
the dessert part of the restaurant,
known as the grocery store. We de-
cided on 2i pint of Ben and Jerry’s
Peanut Butter Cup ice cream. It had
the approximate density of diamond.
Neil Diamond, that is.

It was so dense, in fact, that DAVE
BROKE HIS SPOON. Even the
scoopy part of the spoon. “I would
estimate that to be at least ﬁve Fig
Newtons of force," said Erin, the
well-rounded liberal ans major who
had passed Physics is Everywhere.

sickened by Erin‘s ignorance,
Rebecca said snidely, “Just because
you‘re dumb doesn’t mean you have
to talk. Anyway," she continued,
“Dave‘s spoon didn’t break because
of the forcew it broke because of
The Man."

Erin looked confused, as usual.

"You see," explained Dave gently,
“The I-Iy-Vee deli represents The
Man more than any restaurant we've
gone to." 1

“That‘s right,” continued Megan,
“The Man is made up of many men
and women."

“For instance," Rebecca elaborated,
“A woman can be The Man.”

Erin nodded gravely, Suddenly, her
face lit up in epiphany. “So Pam
Ferguson is The Man!”

We all cheered together, and broke
our spoons in tribute to Pam, The
Man.

In conclusion, despite The Man, or
perhaps because of Him, we ﬁnished
the ice cream by scooping it out with
the scoopy part ofour ﬁngers.

one~should have to. make a “ratio-
nale" before one is allowed such
study.

Surprise, surprise, I was refused
permission to study in France. My
adviser, Victor Verrette, served on
that cornmiitee, and, despite his well-
known estimation of himself as a
deep intellectual and thinker, shared
the other committee members' me—
diocre notions about how everyone
who goes abroad must give them the
same cliched prattle before the stu-
dent will be allowed to go abroad.
He also told me that an appeal would
be pointless. As a result, I dropped
my French majorgwhy should I
support professors and a program
that won’t support mel—and be-
came an English major. Iapplied to
study abroad in England, gave them
the usual bullshit that they want to
hear, and was accepted.

It continues to strike me as amaz-
ingiand I'll continue to be amazed
seventy years from now ifI live that
longithat a supposedly good school
like Grinnell should in instances such
as this stand for so much mediocrity.
Mediocrity in expecting you to give
them the same old bullshit twaddle
they want to hear. Mediocrity in the
lack of respect for students—the pre-
sumption that you’re not worthy to
go abroad unless you prove other-
wise.

Of course, perhaps I should be more
cynical. Perhaps I should not give a
damn, and simply realize that what
they‘re dotng is limiting the number
of people who go abroad so that they
can keep a certain number of warm
bodies in the dorms, bodies Valued
not as individuals but as a stream of
housing income.

What my experience tells me is that
Grinnell needs a better class of ad-
ministrators and a better class of fac-
ulty. In those areas, Grinnell contin-
ues to be a second—string school, with
faculty and staffpossessing second-
rate smallrtown mentalities, believ-
ing that they stand in loco parentis
to the students.

Sincerely,
Vincent Prosser, Class of l988
