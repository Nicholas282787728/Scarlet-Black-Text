Letters eon.

To Annie Butzen and The Grinncll
Student Body-

This letter is in response to Annie
Butzen‘s letter concerning my actions
in ARH. First I would like to say,
that ifAnnie had asked me why I took
down the signs I would have told her
what I told other people later that day.
secondly, I did not “enjoy" taking the
posters down. I had a hard time be
lieving what I was doing as I was re
moving them, but I felt that it was
something I had to do. Also, there
was one important difference be
tween these posters and other antlr
war posters put up on campus over
past weeks thatAnnie failed to menr
tion; these posters did not have a
name on them. This was not a “brave
expression of an opinion." Although
I am a true believer in free speech,
these people were hiding behind this
right and were no more justiﬁed in
their message than I was in taking it
down. Their posters were just as
"anonymous and ambiguous" as my
action. By not having their names
on their posters, they were taking
away my right to respond.

The right to free speech is a right
that is commonly abused and one that
can be taken away, i.e. the Chicago 7

OPINION

inCldClll, If you are going to say
something, no matter what it is you
must take credit for it. Aposterwithr
out an author should not be up in the
first place, A transfer student here at
Grrnlicll told me that at his previous
school signs wrthout namcs or refr
erences to school organizations were
takcn down. I am discouraged that
here at Griiiiicll where people have
so many varying opinions, that
someone would not stand beltilid
thetr words and face the CDltSt‘x
quences otthcir actions So far this
year, the readers of the S &B have
seen many people express their oplnr
ions and taken rcsponsrbrlity for their
words Two weeks ago Jeff Ciepiier
stood up for what he believed even
though he knew he would get "hell"
for it. The day hrs letter was pub-
lished, I complemented him on his
attempt to express how he felt about
the war, even though I may not have
liked what he said. As a matter of
fact, Ido not support Clinton in the
bombing of Iraq, and I may even be
as “far left" as Annie claims shc is.

If these “brave" poster makers
would have had their names on their
posters, I would never have taken
them down, that in my opinion
would have been wrong. Just the
other day a poster was taken off my
board outside my room. I was very
upset by this, not only because it was

Splitting History.

BY CARINE WILLIAMS
Harvard Crimson Staff Writer

(U-WIRE) CAMBRIDGE. Mass.
— As we move into March I am
forced to once more let out a sigh of
perplexity and frustration; yet an-
other Black History Month has
passed us by and I am left feeling
bothered and unnerved. Ever since
my ninth grade of school, the obser—
vance of Black History Month has
been a problematic issue for me. I
never could understand how it was
that black history could be boxed into
this neat time frame when the lives
and experiences of black people have
been integral to centuries of the
American narrative.

; When I asked myrfadter aboutit,
he told me thatdslackHistory Month
is something like ttfe lEsser of tiiIo '
evils. Taking a month to instill pride
by educating young black children
about black heroes and black contrir
butions to society is better than no
month at all. I understand this rea-
soning, and I applaud the efforts of
the black community to (once again)
make something with almost nothing.
Ifit weren‘t for Black History Month,
there would be a lot more people
thinking they know American history
without knowing the names Harriet
Tubman, George Washington Carver
or even Martin Luther King, Jr.

But one of the biggest problems
of Black History Month is that too
many people still don't synthesize
these names with American history.
Segregating the history of black
people into the month of February
implies that black history is differ
ent from American history, This ale
lows for no more than a qualiﬁed rece

ognitton of blacks in American his—
tory, at bestAespite the fact that no
history can be more American than
the history of America’s slaves and
their descendants. History simply
cannot be divided into black and
white, Anyone who really knows
American history knows that there
is no major event in the American
nan'ative which was not in some way
touched by the race issue. What's
more, whether we like to admit it or
not, whites have an intimate role in
the black experience, and noijust as
slave traders and oppressors. I’m
saddened by the fact that I never
heard of“our" while heroes, people
like Elijah Lovejoy and John Brown,
who gave up their lives in the
sttpggleagginst “thg Man,"_ ur
gotjtofcorle‘g‘e . Theidegg‘ that w
separate our pasts by color onlyp
petuates the problems we are grape
plirrg with in the present.

We might be able to attribute the
pitfalls of segregating history to a
necessary cost, arguing, as my father
would, that Black History Month is
something to work with in the mean-
time, until society is ready to inte-
grate black history and American
history. Yet there is something more
that we absolutely can’t ignore. Try-
ing to fit the black experience into
the confines of February has
trivialized black history. For too
many people, black history has be-
come a few famous faces, some
chorce quotes, a bit of kente cloth
and productions showcasing srngrng
and dancing. I realized this in ninth
grade, when I helped organize the
Black History Month celebration at
school, I remember leading the au-
ditorium in the pledge ofallegiance,

my property, but the person who had
tirade the sign had fully taken re-
sponsibility for his words. I guess
my action was crass and deﬁant, but
in my opinion it wasjustified. This
was the first time I have ever taken
down posters, and I hope it is the
last, Ifyou want to say something,
have the responsibility to put your
name on it. Most publications will
notprint anonymous letters, so why
should the campus have to put up
wrtlr anonymous posters. Thcsc
posters did “shout at me and foster
a discussion about

sonrething crucial," thus being the
great responsibility of free speech.
Annie, thanks for writing in and in
viting me to “rnstrgate a debate;"
however, the debate would be pretty
uneventful since I believe and sup—
port a lot of what you say.

Dear Grinnell College Community,

As a majority of this campus
knows, I dislocated and fractured
my ankle the morning of Saturday,
February let in the PEC. I was
sliding into home at baseball prace
lice, and I ended up on a stretcher
with my foot pointing 90 degrees
in the wrong direction.

I would like to take this opportu—'
nity to thank the multitude ofpeople

staring out at a sea of faces and won-
dering what exactly we were really
teaching people about black history.
They‘d already seen the silhouettes
of Martin and Malcolm, they'd
heard the quotes, and, hell, every
one knows we can sing and dance.

Things have stepped up a bit here
at Harvard, but not by much. We've
had more sophisticated shows of
singing and dancing (and thrown in
sortie food afterward) and impresV
sive discussions on race issues in
America today. but. little else. These
things are all virtuous in and of
themselves, serving to commemo»
rate and celebrate an all-tooeoften
denigrated people, but where is the
historical education? As far as I can
tell, the extent ofit was green table
tents featuring black intellectuals
whouare admittedly more 0 cure
thad'sthe usual famous faces. "'

I was glad to see these table tents
on my dining hall table, and I read
each one. But Ijustcan't help wrsh-
ing there were something more,
Even within the month, we do a
poor job of fulﬁlling what should
be the ultimate goal, educating
people about black history. No his
tory can truly be understood with
out its context. It educating people
about black history is not the goal,
and the month is really just about
commemoration and celebration,
then that is wonderful. Meanwhile,
however, the black children who
desperately need to know their his-
tory so that they might find heroes
to inspire them, and the white chil-
dren who desperately need a full une
derstanding of their past to make
sense of their privilege in the
future,are not finding it in their
school curriculum, much less in the
month of Februarv.

who have helped me and my family
through this temporary setback.

First, I‘d like to thank the doctors,
nurses, and EMT'S of Grinncll and
Des Moines for the professional care
I receivcd You moved quickly and
efficiently in giving me world class
care. The doctors of Grinnell made
the right decision in sending me to
Des Moines, when they saw a situae
tioli they Couldn't handle. Thank you
for trusting your own judgment.
Second, I'd like to thank the members
of my old floor, Younker North Sec-
ond Mike Jacobs, Julia Busetti, Mar-
garet Higginson, Sara Shafer, Chris
Dietrich, Ion Pctitt, Iresh Zaker, Car-
rie Stengel, less Isornoto, Erica
Chang, Emily Chan, Michael Haak,
Andrew Kensler, Jane Caplow and
Trinity zdn. You pcople have been
the deﬁnition of helpfulness. From
carrying my tray in Cowles t0 Visitr
ing my new room in Norris, your sup
port has helped ease the transition to
life on crutches. I‘miss you all, and
I'll visit once I feel a little more com-
fortable on crutches,

Third, I'd like to thank Vince
Bustantante and Laura Heilmann, my
neighbors on Norris First. These two
see me everyday, and they have been
both entertaining and helpful to me.
They’ve kept my spirits up, which is
probably the single most helpful ser»
vice anyone can provide.

An Open Letter to Disco

Dear Disco,

After all these years, you andI have
grown pretty close, I know you bel~
ter titan nrost of my friends at this
school, better than my professors.
even better than my family. You
hooked me, you took me, you made
me your own. Halter tops, hot pants.

Bee Gees, the ﬂashing lights! Disco ,

Inferno! The Heat! The hot, ﬂaming
death of my balance, my decision-
making capabilities, my pride. The

tal lobes. Disco, I know you all too
well. And it‘s time I express how I
feel about you, And to be honest with

Scarlet S: Black - Friday, March 6

—_————_—___—————-——

Fourth, I'd like to thank the
Grinnell College baseball team.
Coach Tim Hollibaugh, Coach
Stcvc Larson, Coach Vin Hrasky,
Dave Lukowski, Rob Martin, Mike
Munoz, Stephen White, Jason Zeeh,
JP Christiansen, Perry Gordon,
Davrd Gcary, Dan Corsctti, Dolph
Robb, Tony Smith, Jacob Chavez,
Aaron Rushing, Justin Bates, Jus-
tin Lea, Hsiang An Feng, Rob
Herrick, Joel Claudhous, and Pete
Majerlc. Thank you for all you've
done, from holding my hand while
waiting for the ambulance to mov-
ing all of my things to Norris in
about 5 minutes, Isinccrely thank
you. Your smiling faces make me
realize what a lucky person I am to
have knowtr all of you. I wasn't
sure if I could play Division III
baseball until I saw all the support
I got, starting the ﬁrst day of prac-
tice. My only regret is I won‘t get
the opportunity to play with this
year‘s seniors. Your leadership has
brought new meaning to the word.

Fifth, I'd like to thank Grinnell
College, From the Director of
Housing to the students that hold
doors for me, this college has shown
me more in a week and a halfthan
I‘d seen in the previous semester.
It speaks volumes for tilts campus
and the people associated with it
when they can conjure a smile to

you, I have some issues I think we
need to work out.

Disco, you have a drinking prob
lem. In fact, you are a sloppy, fese
tering mess oozing with glitter and
reconstituted ham from the dining
hall. I can’t remember the last time
I saw you when you didn't smell
like a putrid combination of Banana
Daiquiri wine coolers, Old Milwaue
kec Lite and Brut. I'm assuming
by your sick stumble that you drank
the Brut and slathered yourself in
the liquor. I‘m also assuming by
your general giddy, trustees-mayo
care attitude that you enjoyed eve
ery rriinute of it. I know for a fact
that it's time to end the charade.

What I‘m trying to say is that

you're a disaster waiting to strike -

again. Before this happens, I just
want you to know, Disco, what an
embarrassment you are to yourself,
the school and, worst of all, me.
How can I feel comfortable with
myself when I have taken part in
your little game so often? Because
I ant a human being with faults,
weaknesses and self»indulgent be-
havior patterns. I’ve grown up.
And you have become a monster.
A hideous and seething monster.
You have torn apart lnuch more
than my ability to enjoy myselfin
the Harris Center and my stomach
lining. You are starting to make me
feel like this Campus is nothing
more than a vomitous exercise in
amateur absurdism. You have told
me time and time and again tojoin
you, that you would take care of me.
You took my tuition money and you
lied to me. I was left fuming in the

brighten my day. From the bottom
of my heart, thank you.

Lastly, I have one request to make.
Please support the baseball team.
They've worked extremely hard to
produce the ﬁnest baseball team this
college has had. From 7 am runs, to
midnight madness practices, there
has been nothing but fun and hard
work. The only thing left is you. We
all lovethe game, but we love it even
more when we see our fellow stur
dents cheering, acknowledging our
hard work. I can guarantee you'll
have a good time. You might even
see a cripple try to run the bases.

Sincerely,
Aaron Stockholm ‘01

Dear Editor,

I understand that my request may
seem unusual, yet I believe this to be
a positive effort. I am seeking indie
viduals who would be willing to core
respond with a prisoner.

little smoker's annex-cubicle while
you entertained all the other girls.
What they did not know is that, one
day, they would grow to despise you
just as I do.

! want you to know that I’m not
playing any more games. I've found
a new love who will take me whereI
need to go~ahead in time. His name
is Reality and he knows all about guys
like you. Experience and relative so-
briety has made him the man he is
today. I’ll never forget the first timeI
met him: leaning against the lamp—
posts of Self-respect and Taste streets
wearing a t-shirt that read, "DISCO
SUCKS.” And that’s when I knew
that my Disco Days were over. I'm
ﬁnished with you. So are my REAL
friends. We'll be having a good time
this Saturday instead ofhugging your
toilets of oppression.

Burn in hell.
