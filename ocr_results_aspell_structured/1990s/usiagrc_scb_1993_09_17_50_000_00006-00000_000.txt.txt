A Personal Opinion by Tara Nelson

 

 

students tojustify my choice of friends and associations. Many
white students allege that black students, myself included, are
inclined to be separatist. In response to such allegations, I contend that
black students cannot be separatist at an institution like Grinnell. Further-
more, most actions viewed as separatist by whites are due to their
ignoranceandlackofrespect to therealities ofblack existence atGrinnell.

White students tend to forget or ignore the tart thatblack students are
only seventy students of 1,300 at Grinnell. When black students decide to
eat. study, and party with one another it is usually a therapeutic process to
prepare them for daily interactions with white students. White students
tend to forget that in the classroom black students are in the minority; they ‘
are marginalized by both their peers and professors.Therefore, allegations
by white students of separatism on thepart of blacks is based in ignorance.
How can a black student who decides to attend a predominately white
university in Grinnell, Iowa be inclined to separatism? We are constantly
surrounded by "whiteness" at Grinnell College whether in the town or in
the classroom.

I have never been a separatist at Grinnell. Perhaps, in Detroit at my
all black neighborhood I could he called a “separatist," but I doubt it. In
general, to a certain extent, any productive citizen in the United States
cannot escape“whiteness”. Anyway. I eat, study, and party with mostly
black students because of eommonalty. Why is it that whenever a white
student is ignorant he or she expects a black student to accommodate, and
take responsibility tor their ignorance? I question Ihe validity of any
statements made by white students who are frightened of approaching me
because I am black and female. I judge individuals, not groups of people.

In conclusion, I feel thatblaek students are notseparatist because such
is impossible at an institution such as Grinnell. I invite sincere while
students who want to know me or any other black student to [in the
beautiful and brilliantly constructed language of my urban brothers and
sisters) to check ya’ self before ya’ wreck ya‘ self. Remember difference
is cool, but ignorance is not blissful.

To the Editor:

(This letter IS written in regards
to the letter written by Douglas Fosr
tor, printed in the Sept. 10th issue.)

I take aitn tlljusl how “closely
and carefully" Mr. Foster actually
listened to the Sexual Harassment
Workshop presented at New Student
Days. II he had truly paid attention to
tliedegree claimed, I highly doubt he
could maintain that the advocates
believe“...tt'sokzlytoberuped."Tlie
emotional trauma that follows a
sexual assault is very overwhelming,
and verydlstinct-Idoubtthatanyone
even remotely tied to the experience
would need to be told thil “Being
raped is horrible." NO ONE wants to
be violated like that . it is certainly
NOT FUN!

Mr. Foster claims to believe that
a woman has the right to control her
own body in her own bedroom. He
also claims dint “...rtipe is certainly
not the fault of the victim." Yet the
entiretyofliiszirgumcntdoesiustthat
in placing the blame on the women,
even saying that“...ifone fails to use
common sense, they must suffer the
inevitabldemotionalconsequences."
Does anyone really deserve to suffer
like that? Whose fault is it Mr. Foster
- cenainly not that of the other party
involved! You don‘t even mention
men,exceptofcoursetosaythatthey
should be ”.,.con:ciemiour enough
to stop when asked." Maybe it is both
women and men who need to use
some common sense. Men should
not wait to be told. For their own
safety, as well as that of their part-
ners,ASl(FlRSTlPeopleshouldtake
responsibility for both their actions
and their organs. No person should
ever feel they have the right to cone
trol another human being as if she
was a piece of property (much like
the analogy made to the stolen stereo
system in the original letter), A
woman’s sexuality is not equiptnent
to be stolen, nordoes a stereo system
feel the loss.

Contrary to Mr. Foster's belief.
most women have littleorno control
over being raped - why then mun

 

 

they suffer? How does one have the
power to always avoid rape situa-
tlons? Calling the Escort Service to
walk you home will not keep one
from getting raped. Staying at home
on weekendsandstudyingalonewtll
not keep one from getting raped.
Husbands rape, fathers rape,andyes,
boyfriends rape. To a woman, ANY
MANcanbearaplsl.Mustallwomcn
have to avoid all men in order to be
safe? Itis people like Mr. Fostcrwho
arealways telling women to bescared
and un-willtng to trust, and making
viclilnizing statements such as these
that help perpetuate the cycle ofvtor
lence and abuse.

The Sexual Harassment work-
shop was meant to leacll some re-
sponslbility unit interpersonal com
munication skills for both men and
womcnrno matter what kind ofrclur
tionshipthcy are in. No one can thor-
oughly teach people to prevent rape,
orto take responsibility forthctrown
actions. These are not things about

Iask that Mr. Foster display rea
courage. and help the people who ar
ﬂying to stop this longstanding epi
dcmic of violence (I suggest helpin_
to fortn a men‘s education group
something the campus community
needs). Maybe il'enough peoplehelp
we eventually won't have to liav
