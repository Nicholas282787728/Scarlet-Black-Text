Off-Campus Living: Grinnellians Speak on ‘Slumlords’
STUDENTS RANK THEIR LANDLORDS

lords regarding lifestyle assumptions
based on the appearance or sex of
tenants. Many complaints involved
landlords arrivmg on the rental prey
mises without giving prior notice,
In some cases, students felt that
landlords took an inappropriately pa»
rental interest in their dwellings. Jesr
sica Watson ’00, recalls waking up
on a friend's couch to ﬁnd his land
lord yelling at her. “She pointed to a
mess," says Watson, “and told me
that I‘d better have it cleaned up be-

fore she came back."

Financial issues also Come into
play in the relationship between
Grinnell landlords and tenants,
Many students expressed the senlie
ment that while their residence was
seedier than they would like. as one
anonymous senior said, “I can handle
living in a burnt~out crack house for
150 bucks a month." The feeling that
they are getting a bargain leads many
students to forgive the dreary condi-
tions of their residences.

The most shocking of the grieve
ances involved neglect of the tenants’
complaints involving maintenance
issues. A few days wait in tending
to a clogged sink is certainly an an
noyance, but some cases of landlord

 

neglect cross the line from lssucs of
convenience into impediments to
personal safety. Students reported
collapsing or treacherous stairs, haze
ardous Wiring, and donllclles iniprop.

Two Tenants’ Tales of Terror

Over the period orone summer in
Grinnell, an anonymous senior rer
called the followtng incident as Iyptv
cal of her experience with her apart—
ment and landlord. The student got
out of the
shower to
answer a

the floor of the bathroom that had
dripped onto the head ofher landlord,
who was making repairs in the apart»
ment below. She stated that the lands
lord was extremely upset and
marched into the bathroom where,
said the anonymous senior," in a par-
oxysm ofrage, he ripped the shower
out or the wall. raining plaster and
tiles everywhere, swearing loudly the
whole time.” He left the apartment
as quickly as he came in. and the
shower was not replaced until a
month had passed.

During this same summer, the tone
ant recalled that the apartment was
infested by roaches. In addition the
ceiling fell on her roommate's head.
He escaped serious injury, but she de-

An cvcn more distuiblng account
of landlordrtcnant rclntions comes
from another anonymous scnloi. She
and her housemates had ploblcms
from the beginning. They were dc-
nied access to their house for the first
two months of their lease, ill Vltllllr
lion ol‘lowa tenant laws,

When her housemate visited Gillr
nell in August, she was finally given
the keys to the house. She discov-
ered hornet’s nests, and contacted the
landlord. insisting that they be taken
care of immediately. The landlord
failed to take care of the problem in
a timely fashion.

“When I moved in, I was shocked.
I mean. there Ccrtainly weren't any
hornets on the lease,” says the anonyr
mous seilior. She has a violent al-
lergy to insect stings and shoilly all

wasjust lucky someone was there to
take me to the emergency room,“ she
says. “after that I felt like i was com-

ing home to it dcathtitip."

the anonymous senior and her
housemates discovered that they
were paying at least a hundred dol-
lnrs more each month in rent than the
other half of the house.

Eventually. she and her
housemates broke lease, but the hard-
ship continues. “I notiﬁed the land-
lord of our intent to break lease in a
certiﬁed letter outlining our griev-
ances, and we moved out, but she
won‘t leave us alone.“ The student
continued, “She's called my friends
looking for me, even people I don't
know. [can‘t walk downtown with-
out wondering ifthis is the time when
she sees me and comes after me.“

Generally speaking, most
student‘s encounters with landlords
never degrade to this level. How-
ever, an awareness of tenant rights
and the information available. both
through the Housing Ofﬁce and from
fellow students, could prevent stuv
dents from experiencing the same
kind of trauma in the future.

 

inebriated folk. Even though it may
be ninety seven degrees inside Har-
ris. it will still be in,|he thirties or
lower outside, and the change ' tem-
perature can hit hard. Unfo'rt , ely;
some drunken souls never reach Har-
ris, or arrive at its front doors only
to pass out.

Just as many choose not to drink
and still have a wonderful time, Be-
cause the dance floor can get beyond
crowded, Tews recommended that
serious dancers come early, stay late,
and avoid the drunken mayhem hour
from ten to eleven. Mohamed Jaffer
‘99 said that there is always a non»
alcoholic option at pre—Waltzes. as
Waltz is ”for everyone."

Waltz and pie-Waltzes are suc-
cessful because of the tremendous
effort put into them by many Cone
tributots. HSC‘s, SA‘s, RLC’s. SGA.
as well as other student and staff vol-
unteers all contribute to Waltz’s suc-
cess. Jaffer also credited lots of par
tlcipatlon, as well as SGA budgeting.

Community, cont. from p.1
Yet if the brochure portrays the
college inaccurately, prospectives re-
ceive an incorrect picture of Grinnell.
Enrique: commented, “[for a] sine
dent to make a good decision
.,,[Grlnncll] has to give them the full
picture, and this doesn’t do it."

The Office of Public Relations
and the Ofﬁce ofAdmissions main-
tain that the student body was con-
sulted in the production of the bro-
chure. A student advisory group. Stu-
dent Advisory Committee on
Multicultural Admissions
(SACOMA), was involved in the
planning and creative stages.

But, the fact remains that some
students are unsatisﬁed with the bro;
chure.

Brian Baltes '99, ACE Coordinator,

ity of 'a sectional on“Mac Field, crei

Amber Marsh encouraged people to

There will be a Post Waltz funk

Although Waltz is 'a wonderful
