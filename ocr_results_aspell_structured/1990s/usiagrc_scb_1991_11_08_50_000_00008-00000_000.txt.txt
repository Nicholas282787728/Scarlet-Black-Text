Civil War series continues
with episode two: ForeverFree

By Georgia Dental

The Performing Arts-Department
of History’s program on the Civil

' War continues this Thursday evening

at 7:30 with episode two, Forever
Free.
This episode charts the dramatic

I events which led to the issuing of the

Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln
was convinced by July, 1862 that
empancipation was now morally and

militarily crucial to the future of the
Union, but he had to wait for victory
before he could issue his Proclama—
tion. However. as the yearprogressed,
there were no Union victories.

The episode comes to a climax in
September 1862, with Lee's invasion
of Maryland. On the banks of
Antietam Creek. the bloodiest day of
the war took place. It was followed

shortly by the brightest— the day of *

emancipation.
