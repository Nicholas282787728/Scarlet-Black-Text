Data sheds light on true level of campus diversity

 

By Sharyn Obsatz

Recent discussion about campus
diversity and multi-culturalism ren—
ders crucial an investigation of the
actual percentages and ﬁgures reprer
sentingminorirypresenceatGrinnell.
Comparing tltme figures to similar
data for other colleges and universi-
ties, Iowa. and the United States lends
further insight.

Diversity of the Student Body

10% of all Grinnell students on
carnpusin 1990 identiﬁed themselves
as members of ethnic minorities in
the United States. The 1990 emoll-
ment for Grinnell College breaks
down into 4.6% African-American,
4% Asian-American, 13% Latino/
Latina. 0.1% Native-American, 8%
Foreign, and 82% white.

Recruitment Sucess in the Past

Historically, Grinnell has had some
trouble recruiting minority scholars.
The only available data focuses on
the enrollment of African-American
students. The ﬁrst black student was
admitted to Grinnell in 1363. Be-
tween the years of 1863 and 1954.
Grinnell enrolled only 60 black stu-
dents total. William Deminoff,
GmnellCoHegehismnan,ageedumt
the number of minority students en-
rolled before 1954 was small, but he
argued, “For other institutions, the
answer would have been none."

The number of African-American
students atGrinnell has grown slowly
since the late 1960’s. During the
1950's no class had more than three
black members. The class of 1969
had 17 black students enroll and 14
graduate. 23 black students enrolled
in theclass of 1973 and 17graduated.
Since then, the African-American
presence on campus has grown to its
presentsize of 59 students - a growth
which Deminoff behaves reﬂects a
conscious commitment of the college
to minority recruitment

In the Iowan Context

Today Grinnell College has a
greater representation of all minority
groups (except Native-Americans)
than the state of Iowa. According to
1990 Census ﬁgures, the population
of Iowa is 0.3% Native-American,
0.9% Asian-American, 1.7% Afri-
can-American and 96.6% white, with
0.5% of those surveyed identiﬁed as
members of “other races." The cen-
sus also shows that 1.2% of Iowa’s
population characterizes itself as His»

panic, according to August 28. 1991
issue of The Chronicle oer‘gherEdu-
cation. Apparently, these Hispanics
have been tallied by the Census as
members of several other races, in-
cluding whites, rather than as a sepa-
rate racial category. 5% of all college
students in Iowa are members of mi-
nority groups.
Compared to the Nation
Conversely. the racial make-up of
Grinnell College is slightly less dir
verse than that of the United States.
Nationally, the racial distribution.
accordingtothe 1990Census, isO.8%
Native-American, 2.9% Asian-
American, 12.1% African-American,
80.3% white. and 3.9% listed asother
races. Included in these tallies are the
9% of people surveyed who charac-
terized themselves as Hispanic. Thus
Grinnell College has a higher repre'
sentation of Asian-Americans and a
signiﬁcantly smaller representation
of Latinos/Latinas on campus com-
pared to the national population
While American minorities com-
prise 18.9% ofall enrollment in instir
tutions of higher education in the
United States. they comprise only
10% of Grinnell‘s student popula-
tion. On the other hand, foreign stu-
dents make up 8% of Grinnell’s en~
rollment compared to the national
ﬁgure of 2.8% enrollment.
Changing National Context
Change is predicted for the appli-
cant pool from which Grinnell will
draw in the future. The US. Census
Bureau projects that the racial make-
up of the nation will grow slightly
more diverse. For example. by the
year2000,blackswillconstitute13.1
percent of the population, and their
proponion will increase to 13.7% in
2010. The population of African-
Americans in the Midwest will in-
creasefrom10% oftheregion’spopu-
lation according to 1990 figures to
11.9% in in the year 2010. Since
1980, the rate of growth of the Afrir
can-American population has in»
creased twice as fast as that of the

white population according to the U.S.
Bureau of the Census.

Compared to Other Colleges

OberlinCollege’sdiversity greatly
exceeds that of Grinnell. 20% of
Oberlin students are from American
minority groups. However, intema-
tional students make up only 4% of
Oberlin‘s enrollment (while foreign
students comprise 8% of Grinnell’s
enrollment). Al the University of
Chicago, minorities represent 23.6%
of the student population. At
Macalester College, 16.6% of the
American enrollment is members of
minority groups from the United
States and another 12.7% of students
come from other counLn'es,

Stall“, Administration Diversity

Grinnell has also made efforts to
diversifyitsadminislrativestaff. both
in terms of ethnicity and gender. For
the year 1991-92. women comprise
53% of total administrative staff and
ethnic minorities comprise 5.4% of
administrators. Nonetheless. at the

level of executive administration, out
of nine employees. eight are men,
one is female and none are minority.
Women outnumber men in the bot-
tom three levels of administration.

Grinnell's current support staffis
89% female, but it lacks any minority
members. Jo Calhoun. Grinnell’s af—
firmative action ofﬁcer. explained that
support staff is drawn from a local
pool and the absence of support staff
from minority ethnic groups reﬂects
the low number of minorities in the
areas surrounding Grinnell. The col-
lege only advertises locally for sup-
port staff job openings; advertise-

Diversity 01 Faculty

Growth in the ethnic diversity of
faculty has been “spotty," according
to Calhoun. While the percentage of
faculty that is female has grown from
25% during the years 1978—1983 to
39% forthe l991-l9923cademicyear,
minority representation inched from

3%m1979-1980104.4%m198210
7.3% in 1991 and ﬂuctuates from
year to year. Calhoun argued that this
slow growth rate in the number of
minority faculty does not represent
the college’s recruitment efforts.
“The faculty is doing areally good
job in searches to identify a diverse
pool of applicants. There is a lot of
competition from diverse candidates
with graduate degrees. Those with
doctorates have theirpick ofschools,"
said Calhoun. She also said it was a
“difﬁcult decision" for professors of
color to come to Iowa where they are
“so much in the minority.” Living in
the community also has implications
for their children. “It‘s not as easy as
living in an urban area," she said.
Currently, there are five African»
Americans, three Asian-Americans
and two Hispanichmericnns on the
Grinnell faculty. According to
Calhoun, Grinnell’s affirmative ac‘
tion targets for five years from now
include females comprising 50% and
minorities comprising 12% of fac-
ulty.
Grinnell's Efforts Will Continue
Everyone is committed to identi—
fying diverse pools of students and
employee applicants, according to
Calhoun. Deminoff said he believes
Grinnell has made significantprogress
in recruiting minority students, fac-
ulty and administration. The statisr
tics appear to support his assertion.

Dispelling common myths about
the black community, defining
multicultural education and outlin-
ing a plan for establishing bettcredu-
cation for African-American children.
especially males. was the focus of a
lecture by Dr. lawanza Kunjufu. A
leader in the ﬁeld of multicultural
education. Kunjufu spoke on “Devel-
oping a Multicultural School: Future
Trends in Education" last Tuesday in
South Lounge.

He began by giving his audience
some statistics to disprove the com-
mon assumptions that blacks consti-
tute the majority of drug users and
welfare recipiean. In iaCl,76% ofall
drug users are white. and 65% of
those below the poverty level are

it is white-collar crime.

He then asserted that. although
predominantly black schools are not
aswellfundedaspredominately white
schools,black schools cannot usethis
as an excuse to fail. “The key," he
said, “is that teacher expectation leads
to student achievement. If theteachcr
expects nothing because the children
are poorly fed or dressed, the student
will achieve nothing."

Speaking about the concept of
multicultural education, Kunjufu ex7
plained how several groups could see
the same event from completely drfv
ferent perspectives. He gave the voy-
age of Columbus as an example.

“If you ask the Europeans, they
williellyoulhalColumbus DISCOVV
ERED America. If you ask Native
Americans. they will lell you that
Columbus INVADED America," he
said.

The truth. said Kunjufu. is
multicultural, gathering all the per-
spectives of various groups.

“Multicultural education is NOT
saying.‘Wearanativecostumehring
a dish, and we’ll play some of your
music.’ That's a freak show,“ he said.

He went on to describe his seven
proposals for improving education
forAfricanrAmcrican children.cspev

His plan involves mandatory in
service training for schoolteachers in

ences in how AfricanrAmertcan boys
learn. In addition, a role-model sys
tem and an after-school “rite of pos-
sage" would be implemented to give
African-American boys identity.
Black males would be encouraged to
become teacher assistants and teach-
ers.

In addition, he advocated the “Dr.
King classroom,” in which students
wouldleam aboutblack history"more
than just during February and Ihe
third week ofJanuary." His final con-
cept was that of the “Malcolm X
classroom," in which teacher expec-
tations would be high both academi-
cally and morally.
