A Tale Of Career DeVeIOpment A Foolish Consistency

BY DAVE FRIEDMAN
Columnist

Alice is a beautiful person. She
wants to do a beautiful thing She
wants to work with victims of do-
mestic violence and ‘sexual assault,
She knows these women need help,
She knows how many of these
women exist. One out of every four
women needs this kind ol'help. This
number reaches to Gl’lﬂl’lell. This
number reaches around the globe.

Last semester Alice went to study
in Costa Rica. There were people
there who needed help. As a part of
her Studies she worked with battered
women in it government center.
Grinnell College felt this was a wore
thy program and rewarded her efforts
with college credits.

This summer Alice stayed in
Grinnell, She decided to volunteer
at DVA/SAC. an organization In

Marshalltown devoted to helping vic- »

tims ofdoniestic violence and sexual
assault. It was quite a commitment
oftime and energy, and it meant that
she could not pursue other employ-
ment. Pam Ferguson thought that
this should not deter Alice, and gave
her a grant to help with her expenses.
Alice was grateful that Pam would
be so generous with the college’s
funds and all for a worthy cause so
often overlooked.

This semester Alice continued her
Work at DVA/SAC, The women run
ning the center were quite pleased

with her work, and were delighted

by the fact that she spoke Spanish.
There are quite a number of Spanr

ish- speaking women in need ofhelp.
and the center prevrously has little
success in responding to their needs.
Alice proved quite helpful, and she
found the work was improving hei-
abilities in Spanish and her knowl~
edge of and her response to the prob-
lems facing women. It was decided
that her work was so beneficial that
she was asked to do more of it, to
assist in the formation ofa new po-
sition: rural minority outreach coor-
dinator: an impressive title, and a dc»
manding task. This new positron
would require a lot ofiime and a lot
ofeffort, far more than her summer
and fall position, and now she had
the responsibilities ofa full time stu-
dent at aschool once regarded as one
of America’s most prestigious Col~
leges, It seemed ludicrous that she
should have to give up the work
which was proving so helpful to so
many people, including herself. A
solution was found.Actually, itdidn‘t
take very long to realize that Alice
could fulﬁll her role as student and
outreach coordinator through the
college's internship program.

After sorting through and then com—
pleting the paperwork required by the
college, she turnedjt in to the career
development office, Her supervisors
at DVA/SAC advised her that they
would contact the school and reem-
phasize the importance of Alice’s
role in the success of their program,
a program consistently supported
through grants to student volunteers,
a program which gets many of its
volunteers from the Grinnell campus
and community. Alice thought she
was about to take a major step to-
wards achieving her eareer goals.
This internship would look quite im»
pressive on a resume; it would give
her experience that very few twenty-
one year old women have. And with
her concentration in Gender and
Women’s studies and her long term
study of Spanish it seemed she was
taking a major step towards achiev-
ing her academic goals as well. But

it was not to be.

On Tuesday, Alice received a letter
from the Career Development Ofﬁce
informing her that her internship ap
plication had been rejected. The rea
son stated in the ﬁrst paragraph was
“because you have not completed
anycourse workinihe Sciences"Tlle
second paragraph explained that her
proposal was positive in terms oflier
eventual career goals, but given the
competition for the limited numbci
of available internships, there were
stronger proposals, The third para
graph said, “I‘m sorry"

How can this be justified? Had
Alice taken Chemistry is Everywhere
or The Green Connection would she
have been allowed to help the people
who asked for and needed her help‘.7
Would four science credits be as benr
eﬁcial to Alice and her communiryl
Does Grinnell College really have no
course requirements beyond those of
majors, or is thatjust one of the lies
used to lure prospective students‘.I

How can a limited number of me
ternships bejustifled'.7 An internship
has no cost to the college; it is a valid
means of education. How can it be
valid only ror thirty five students?
How can it be explained that quali-
ﬁed candidates are refused Opportur
nities to make an actual, not theoretir
cal, difference in the world? How can
the college argue that this work is
worth its own cash dollars and not
academic credits’.7 Most importantly,
most disgustingly, how can a college
this small consistently overlook the
best interests of individual students
in favor of the interests of its own
bureaucracy?

This is Alice‘s story, I guarantee
there are others. The problems are
spreading. It is an attitude as much
as it is policies People, it is time to
get loud! It is time that this college's
policies and attitudes are questioned
and exposed. It is time that the ad
ministration‘is made to answer.

When youl tutorial prolessor asks
you in the middle of class whether
or not it‘s true that you have a ltfﬁr

you know it's time to Write about
something else. You also know that
it's time people learned something
about you besides your sexual Orlr
entation and ethnicity At least that‘s
what I ﬁgured. So today‘s column is
your chance to ﬁnd out ti litile bit
more about me. (It was either that or
hear about the delicacy the room
mates were solved one dinner dur-
ing Fall Break, and one of the room-
mates didn‘t think the entire campus
needed to know about that.)

So, to start With. a little background:

Applylng 15 easy. For tatomarron,

tilly born in Iowa (Waterloo, to be
exact) so even though I say it's my
first winter, it's really not, but
twelve years on the west coast does
wonders to one's ability to recall
suhzcro toillpcialures, I also haven't
hccn back to Iowa since I was six
(except to visit Griimell last year)
so ir one more person oohs and aahs
that I’m “returning to my roots" I
think I‘m going to punch them.

['in really not a Violenl person
though. I llkc little kids and furry
animals, animals with scales too. I
lll'cgitai'ded. taught little kids how
to swim, and coached at youth syn-
chronized swim team over the sum-
mer. I have a pet fish in California
named Happiness. (He was sup-
posed to come to Grinnell wuh me
, let’s hour it for self-governance
and allowing pots in domisl — but I
wasn‘t allowed to bring him on the
plane! Did you know that only
“warm-blooded animals that will fit
in a kennel" are allowed now?
What crap. I miss my ﬁsh.)

Anyways, Happiness is the only
pct I've ever had besides Snickers,
my beloved pet hamster who died
six years ago and is buried in my
backyard in California,

My favorite color is yellow.

I like Joli-O, especially Jeler with'
fruit,

and for some reason this never
ceases to fascinate people, It's not
that hard though, really.

The last book that I read that
wasn't for class was called The Te
ufPig/u and I thought it was won-
derful and I highly recommend it.

I think that more ot‘the bathrooms
on campus ought to have bathtubs.
I also think that students should

I just got my photographs back
from fall bl'cak. I look a lot of picr
lures ofthc ocean and mountians. I
plan on pasting these photographs
to windows in my apartment so I
can pretend that I'm really not in
Grinnell and instead in abigciiy by
the ocotin full of beautiful people
and good cable channels. [should
have taken a bunch of pictures of
big buildings and taped them to the
inside of my sunglasses so when
ever I wear my sunglasses downr
towliitwillreallylooklikel’miria
dowlitown area. Ooooh. Big Buildv
ings. Ooooh The Ocean Ooooh,
Mountains. Qoooh. Comedy Cen-
tral Of course. we can't really do
anything about the geographical lo-
cation or the college, And unless
gold is discovered around here, I
really doubt many people will move
into Giinnell in enough time that

have free time (and some Mr.
Bubble) so that we might put those
tubs to good use. i

Ithink that working in the mailroom
is the best job in the world even
though I'm told I Won't think that
come January and Febmary.

I think ihatGrinnell should getmore
Macs. Even though i came here a die-
hard PC fan, I've since been con-
verted.

I think that simple pleasures are
underrated,

I think that green Shoelaces are
much harder to find than one might
think.

I think I had a really profound
thought butjust nowiforgot it.

I think that I’m starting way too
many sentences with “I think.“

Idon‘t understand why there are no
lights in the showers here or why they
call round bread with holes in the
middle bagels when they taste like
regular bread to me. ,

I think it's funny that I‘m not the
only one who “sends" to people on
VAX when they’re in thesameroom.

I think that I can handle it here ifit
doesn‘t get any colder.

And now, in light ofthe occasioni I
leave you with this thought: Sugar is
the best.

Thanks goes out to all the wonder-

after they read this column; special
thanks goes to one of the roommate‘s
families for generously hosting the
other roommate for one whole week:
and extra special thanks to one of my
best friend’s moms. who sent me a
surprise package with a big, stuffed,
yellow-bellied frog! (That and some

we‘d see a building over four stories.
We can, however. call TCI Cable

to have my parents tape Dr Katz for
me anymore. We could watch The

South Park, and The Kids in the Hall
as often as we want. of course, we
may never leave the television again.
But we could watch The Daily
Show!!! I urge all ofyou to call TCI
at 1'800r244r0677 and demand
Comedy Central, dammit. While
you’re at it, demand VH1 too. Imiss
Pop Up video too. Did you know
the mom from the Cosby Show used
to be married to the police officer in
The Village People and was a disco
queen in the Seventies? A fun and
informative fact I learned from Pop
Up Video. They have many fun and
informative facts. It’s the basis for

Oh yeah. to all you people I keep

anywhere else I see the stuff.
