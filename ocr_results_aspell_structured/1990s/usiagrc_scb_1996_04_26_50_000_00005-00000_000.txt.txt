Broken Arrow is the code name
tora“misplacoti”iiuclcarnussila it's
also the name of a movie starring
Christian slatcr and John Travolta,
but there’s nothing misplaced about
the plot or nonstopaction. Christian
Slater antl John Travolta play army
men with the daunting task ottrans
putting a nuclear missile, Travolta,
embittered by his long army cateet
without a promotion, flips out and
hijacks the mission Slater, with the
aid ofa forest ranger (the EMMCBEZIE»
Me Lady froin Pump Up the VOL
time), attempts to retrieve the mis«
sioii before Travolta enacts his crazed
doomstlnyplnn. Travolta isso good at
being bad; this is one of his first roles
showmg his stuffsince he broke with
tho typocasting of Staying Alive.

One powerhouse action scene
after another, the only tests in this
movte occur when one or more ofthe
characters are hiding under a tnrpaue
lin, or behind a wall. NOIWlEhStnnde
ing the lack oftime for the characters
to converse as they are evading nu—
clear bombs, the plot manages to
forward itselfwithout any lackofcom
pleXity. This movie is a marvellous
cholce for anyone who likes action

very poignant message in light ofthe

The Chorus will also perform

of the intense emotions contained
within the piece that cannot often
