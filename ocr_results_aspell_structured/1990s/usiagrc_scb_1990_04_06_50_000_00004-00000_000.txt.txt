The Nature 5
In recent weeks, there has been a great deal of confusion surrounding

the nature of an editorial. Obviously, signed opinion pieces are written by

individuals with opinions not necessarily shared by the Scarlet and Black.

But who writes the articles that appear without by-lincs, and who is to
be supported and/or blamed for the opinions within?

The answer lies below this article.

Eleven people are listed m members of the Scarlet and Black staff, and
11 people contrrbute to the unsigned editorials that normally run on this
page. Each staff member is rﬁponsible for writing at leastonc editorial
during the Semester, although the content is decided by the entire staff.

Noteveryone agrees with the contentof every editorial. It is impossible
to expect total concurrence from 11 diverse individuals, but our aim is to
provide a consensus opinion of our Staff.

As with all articles that appear in the Scarlet and Black, however,
liability for all editorials rests with the editor in chief. It is the editor in
chiefs duty to make cenain that editorials are well-informed, supported
by the available facts, and advocate responsible positions.

It is our intention that this explanation will clarify some of the

unanswered questions about unsigned editorials as we begin the second
half of the semester.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

College Should Sign
Peace Declaration

To the editor,

The Iowa Peace Institute, a
valuable resource which is located
in Grinnell, is looking for ways to
support the development of world
peace and conﬂict resolution. One
such way is the Talloires
Declaration, a pact signed by 45
international universities in
September 1988.

The Talloires Declaration states,
“We, the presidents of 45 univer-
sities from all regions and many
cultures of the world...bclieve that
the universities of the world bear
profound moral responsibilities to
increase understandingot the of the
awfulrisksofthenuclearageandto
reduce those risks. Charged by our
societies to prepare our students for
life, we are committed as educators
to prevent global dealh."

The Declaration offers several
ideas to achieve these goals:
“language, history, culture. and
methods to create peace must be
integral pans of the subjects thatwe
teach....Research and teaching
should incorporate contributions

form many fields of knowledge.
and universities should support the
development of.courses and
research on arms control,
negotiation and conflictresolution,
peaceanddevelopment,andrelaled
subjects."

The original 45 members, which
include universities from all over
the world, hope that other
universities around the world will
join them in this effort by signing
the declaration as well, and many
others have done so since 1988‘

Ambassador John McDonald.
the president of the Iowa Peace
Institute, has spent the last year
getting Iowa colleges and univer-
sities to do so as well. Twenty»two
Iowa institutions have new signed
thepact,includingtheUroflJSU.
and the UNI, so that Iowa has more
colleges supporting this declaration
than any nation in the world. But
Grinnell College, although it has
been asked to pledge several times
in the last year, has not srgnod the
declaration

Signing the declaration does not
involve any extra expenses on the

partof the college, nordoes itrequire
atimeschedule. It is aphilosophical
commitment, a way of saying
enough is enough, let’s do
something aboutachieving a better
world.

Grinnell has repeatedly claimed
to support the goals of the pledge,
so wlty has it not signed the declar~
ation? With Peace Day coming up
soon, and the "Going Global"
program and the new Peace Corps
program underway this year, this is
the time As McDonald said, “If
MIT and Dartmouth can do it, why
can’t Grinnell?”

I would like to propose to the
students and faculty that they
support the signing of the
declaration, perhaps as a part of
Peace Day coming up this month.
Grinnell has a chance hear to help a
world "plagued by war, hunger,
injustice, and suffering...and work
on the relationship between peace
and development,” With our
support of signing the declaration.
Grinnell can make a difference.

Ambiguous Policy Led to
Arbitrary Memo Cuts

To the editor,

This week, for the second time, I
submiuedanotice to the Memo that
was not printed. The ﬁrstorte was
the infamous “What Do You Call
It?” notice about a Men’s Alliance
for Change meeting with the dis»
cussion topic of penises. But waita
minute,you thoughttherewasano-
ticeaboutthat? That’sbecausel re-
wrote and resubmitted the thing I
had to do thatbecause ofaprublem
with “obscenity" in the original
notice. If you haven‘t heard about
that incident, ask around. I'm not
going into itagain.

This time, it was a notice about
a production of Harvey Fierstein's
“SAFE SEX" that isbeingputonat
UNI in Cedar Falls this weekend
and carpooling to get there. When
Icalledtofind outwhyitdidn’tget
into the Memo, Bill Deminoff told
me that it was about an off-campus
event. it didn't appear tovhave ma-
jor sponsorship from a group on
campus, and they didn't feel that
there would probably be much re-
sponse to the notice, so they didn‘t
printiL Apparently LheMemo was
deluged at one time with notices
regarding off-campus events and
decidedlostopprintingtltem,judg-
ing them now on an individual basis
to determine their “worth” to the
campus community. This raises a
few questions: How do they decide

whatwillandwhatwon'tget‘much
response"? How much response
would a notice have to get to have
“enough" to be printed? How do
they determine the amount of re
sponse something gets anyway?
I've submitted things in the past
about events in Des Moines and
Iowa City that are not sponsored by
any group on campus, and those
notices have been printed.

In light of these incidents, I

strongly urge Mr. Dcminoff and
theMemo topublicize theirpolices
regarding material submitted for
publication (such as a definition of
what they consider to be “obscene“
and therefore "unprintable" and
what kinds of things they usually
don't include). It would be nice to
know how they make their deci-
sions before a notice gets cut.

Kent Could Learn
from His Own Advice

To the editor,

Remember a couple of weels
ago when Mike Kent railed against
Grinnell's supposed liberal ideo-
logy? In two successive Scarlet
and Black columns, he decried a
system offering skewed (and even
Marxist) perspectives of the world,
and at a Joint Board meeting, pubr
licly doubted the abilityofGrinnell
students to defend their viewsin the
fabled “Real World." Where the
college‘s propaganda sees well-
rounded, thoughtful citizens of its
graduates.Kentseespublicridicule.

His solution: a committee to
evaluate and ameliorate ideologi-
cal inequities in class instruction.

Then, in a seemingly unrelated
incident, Kent wrote a column re-

nouncing those who, in the Real
World, actually GET PAID to de-
cry things. Speciﬁcally, he doubted
the sincerity of those who advo-
cated remedies for such so»called
environmental issues as global
warming and the Greenhouse Ef-
fecL He noted vested interests in
healthy reswch grants and sizable
speakers‘ fees that could be com
strued as vehicles of private and
political gain, not services per-
formed in th public's interests.

He warned us: "Just remember
who sold you the problem when
you go shopping for solutions.”

Awisethought. I’mjustwonder—
ing,M.r.KenLhowmuchyouaskin’
forthatad hoc committeeof yours?
