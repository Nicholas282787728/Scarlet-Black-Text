These diverse groups prove that
acoustic music in hardly be solely
deﬁned as plugrlc , On the contrary,
this musical genre exhibits outstand-
ing \arlety. which audience members
will be able glimpse on Saturday
night.

"All tour hands are really good,"
emphasized Salzman “There's not a
sttttkcr tn the bunch!"

Hoping to promote, according to
Salzman. a “communal type sharing
atmosphere," performers plan to rt;
move the chairs from Bob's and are
encouraging students to bring sleep-
ing bags and blankets.

criiincltians are responding posi-
tively lo the piospccl of live acous
tic music on campus.

“I think guitars can do aniaztng
things to music." said Mary
Dilvts‘01.“'l'hcy go rcatty well tvith
pcoptu‘s voiccs. I’m excited for thc
concert."

“Although I
live with half of
Adobe Zweig,”
noted» Andy
Nelson'OO, “l
have yet to see
them in concert—
50 I'm excited.”

The question
orwhy Grinnell’s
music scene re-
mains so
downplayed is
difficult to an-
swer, considering
the number of talented and enthusi-
astic students.

“There are a lot of creative stu
dents here." said Salzman, “and it
doesn’t seem like there have been
many forums for them to express
themselves aside from the occasional
publication or Bob's concert."

llee rigor} aracidcmic life and
lack..0l communication between
musical groups of dirrcrcnt styles
could be attributed to this problem.

However, “The Hub" represents
an honest attempt to rectify such situ-
ations by providing a positive and
welcoming atmosphere for musk
cians .

The cvcniual goal is Inspiration of
audience members [0 make tttustc
themselves, which will effectively
broaden Grinncll's current music
SCCUC.

Melchtzedek omphasizcd that
pcoplc shouldn't feel afraid to play
at open mic nights or performances
like this one.

"ll' someone in the audience be-
comes next year's pct-former." noted
Sulzntan. “we’ll really have achieved
something."

signs advortising “The Hub" have
already been posted around eanipUS,
and claim that Bob's “will look at
little different on Saturday."

This new look could be just what
Grittncll needs,

she uses an alias, and U540.

it? Sure enough it is. Ccdillu. whose

KDIC with “The Book 01'

4:20pm unti16 00pm.

K.N : Ccdilla is a very differ-
ent name. Why did you choose it
tor your alias?

C.: Because it is Bob Marley’s
daughter‘s name. She is a mcmr
ber ofthc Melody Manardes. I re
spect her because she IS phat.

K N : She is fat',7

C,; ot because she is fat. Ber
cause she is cool. P»H7AVT. Pretty
hot, I might add.

K,N.; What music do you play
on your SllDW7 '

 

 

 

C.‘ I play a lot of Reggae mu-
sic My favorite artist is
Silverknockcr. but 1 also play beats
like Culture and Bob Marley, of
course, Alsoi BUjubattton is the
#$@*. Basically, you can expect to
hear others like Jimmy Cliff and For
tcl' Tosh and all those good guys.

K.N.: Why did you choose to play
Reggae, beside your obvious love for
it?

C: I think that it is really neces
sary for the campus to learn more
about other cultures and other
people. Rastafarlanistn and the
people of Jamaica imbibe a very in-
teresting, very prominent culture that

C.: Ijust think that a lot of people
choose to listen to music that has no
meaning. Sonic people will listen to
anything that involves techno. That
is cool if it has meaning to you, but

K.N.: In light orihc fact that you
want to educate students in
Rastafﬂriantsm. which bands would
you choose to bring to campus?

C: I would definitely bring Cull
lurc here. I saw them in Iowa City
last week and they are Chill. 1 would
also get Burning Spear. Maybe some
Sitar music, as well as some jazz.

K.N.: What method would be the
best for Grinnell?

C: I think that it is imponant to
have Reggae musicians come out
and get them interested in outdoor
concerts and shows here. Musicmns
could speak to students about what
they are all about. Because no one
is really going to trust a little white
girl with her opinion about Reggae,

C: When Natty Nation came they.
talked to the students and gave them
an insight into their music and reli-
gion. Students upprcciaicd thcir
openness. I think they would like to
see more of that type of interaction
with the bands.

K.N.: What is the goal or your
Show?

C: To educate people about
Raslafarianism and show them that
it isn‘ljusl an anti-white movement.
I also want to have a good time while
playing kickass music. I take a lot
of requests. but I refuse to play
UB40.

K N -Why won't you play UB407

C: Because UB40 isn't true
Reggae. ‘Tltey are suck.‘ That is a
direct quote from a good friend.

C: Once in a while I will play
clips of Rastafarians speaking about
their religion. Sometimes I will
choose a particular artist for the day
and i will just spin them for the two
hours, I try to give a good taste show
that shows that Rastafarianism is not
just about smoking marijuana and
that it has a lot of meaning in il.

to solve everything by making their

can be. How Well will they do in the
