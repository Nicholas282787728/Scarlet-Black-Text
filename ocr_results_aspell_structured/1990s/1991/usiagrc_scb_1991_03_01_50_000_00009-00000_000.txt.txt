PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

Fernandez-McCarthy professes
dedication, experience

By Pedro Fernandezr
McCarthy

There is no question in my mind
that mostGrinncIl Collegcstutlents
would make excellent presidents.
However. only those with a genur
inc love for student government
work would be willing to consis»
tanly work at the pacenecessary to
do a good job, while at the some
Lime avoiding “bumrout.”

Ithinkl amoncofthosepersons.
For example. although constitu-
tionally I‘m required to hold four
office houts a week, last semester I
held fourteen. This semester I'm
holding twelve, but with hours eve
ery day of the week. My weekly
time commitments further extend
into chairing Joint Board and
Cabinet meetings. attending meet-
ings with College administrators
and participating in various Com-
mittcc meetings. If one considers
thatIalso mustperform less regular
activities and projects such as or-
ganizingopenforums.holdingSGA
study breaks, participating in ad
ministrative searches (President,
Director of Student Activities) and
reporting to Alumni Board and the
Board of Trustees whenever they
meetoncatnpus.itquicklybecomes
apparent how substantial the time
commiunentreally is. Yet.notonly

am I willing to do it
again. Igenuinely want
to. I enjoy what I do.

Pcrhapssurprisingly,
much of my job further
entails dealing with
many relatively minor
details such as ensuring
thattheeastdoorto ARH
receives a door handle,
thatBrown House getsa
television, that students
be allowed to use their
access codes in hall
phones, or making sure
that a path be installed
between thePEC and the
Harris Center.

It is only by address
ing these tasks quickly
andeffectivelythatlam
able to deal with more

insisting thata handicapped-acces-
sible bathroom bcinstalled in Loose
Hall(whichisthconlyare2tinSouth

bility to a terminal room). or using

my office to involve SGA in com--

munity service. For example. I sit
on the Community Service Center
Advisory Board; I coordinated the
SGA Toy Drive, and (the accom-
plishmentI’m proudest of) I helped
form the College/School Youth
Relations Organization, which

hopefully will fosterzi better sense
of community between the City of
Grinnell (malnly the youth) and the
College.

Despite having done my best to
familiarize myself with every as-
pect of my work. it’s a ncvcrrcndr
ing process. Perhaps that is what
appeals to me the most. There are
always new issues and projects to
work on. The job never gets stale.

Gardos seeks pure

First of all, when 1

was more appropriate.
So for those of you
who think I am as bland

here are some of my ideas:

Stippich promises to meet student needs

By Matt Stippich

I have decided to throw my hat
into the ring for SGA President.
For those of you who don‘t know
me, I’m Matt Stippich, and I am
currently one of the SGA Treasur~
ers.

Over the past year, I’ve been
intensely involved in the workings
of Student Government. The role
of Assistant Treasurer has taught
me the “ins and outs" of SGA and
dtecollcgeadministration. Because
the primary duty of the SGA Trea~
surer is the allocation of funds to
students. I‘ve come to understand
the wants and needs of students.
This is an important characteristic
thatlwill carry into theofﬁceof the
President. My experience has also
allowed me to create a good work-
ing relationship with many mem-
bers of the college administration.

Besides carrying out my dclr
egaled responsibilities, I have also
worked I0 improve other areas of
Student Government. You may
have noticed the computer infor»
mation board I‘ve created that is

Matt Stippich

currently used by SGA to solicit
student opinion and distribute in-
formation. I have completed an
accounting system that has turned
the SGA Treasurer’s office into a
credible allocator of f unds. I have
also experimented with new ways

to allocate SGA funds.
“Bank accounts" have
been created for student
groups. Thcscaccounts
provide students With a
central. organized area
to store funds. I have
organized a Sports Club
Task Force that is
searching for new ways
to fund and organize
Athletic Clubs on the
Grinncll Campus. I‘m
genuinely interested in
the needs of students.
and I have used my of-
fice to accommodate
those needs. Now I
would like to address
these needs through the
office of Student Gov-
ernment President,
SGA needs a
change to parallel the
change the campus will experience
with the incoming President
Ferguson. President Ferguson is a
strong advocate of studentinvolvee
merit and student opinion; some-
thing which SGA should mirror.

The SGA President should not be a
dictator of student rules and ideas;
instead, the President should facili~
tatcand mediate studentrdeas. The
Grinnell campus is unique because
it IS home to many interests. The
President should be one to work

work among students. faculty, ad-
ministrators, and townspeople to
actively connect ideas. The Presir
dent is elected to work for you7
and I‘m definitely willing to work
for you. I look forward to being a
cohesive link between the student
body, President Ferguson. and the
rest of the administration.

The role of SGA President is
indeed a major commitment. I’m
ready for the commitment, and I
look forward to the challenge. I
have shown U10 desire and Lhc drive
to perform the duties of President.
As President. I will break the stage

A word from
the Scarlet
82. Black

During last year’s SGA elec-
lions. thc Scarlet & Black received
much criticism for its alleged fur
voritism for pZifUCuit’iX presidential
candidatesAtthattitne.tlleSthcl
& Black decided to abstain from
endorsing mly candidate to avmd
further allegations by the student
body.

This year. the Scarlet & Black
will again choose not to endorse
any prcstdcntia] or viec-prcsiden»
tial candidates. This decision was
based not only upon the conﬂicts
over last year‘s endorsement, but
upon a total surf f consensus that the
Scarlet & Black need not influence
the voting decisions made by oth
ers.

This is not a reﬂection of our
judgements on any of the candi-
dates; this supplement is merely a
meansforthecandidatestoexpress
their views and opinions to the stu-
dentbody. So read the supplement.
attend Sunday's open forum. and
above all, vote.
