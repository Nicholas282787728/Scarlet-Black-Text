. Red Men wear down gridder defense

By Jason Wolf

The football team saw their record
fall to 1-3 last weekend as they lost to
the Ripon Red Men, 2914. The Red
Men used a powerful and fastrpaced
offense to control the hall for almost
forty minutes and wear out the Pio-
neer defense.

At half-time, Ripon had jumped
outtoa lorOIead forcingthe Pioneers

. to play Cflltihrup.

Pioneer runningback Ted Stanley
scored Grinncll's flrsttouchdown on
a one yard run midway through the
second-half. Stanley ended the day
with 44 yards rushing on only four

attempts.

up a seventeen point lead, the Pier
neers scored on an 84 yard touch-
down pass from quarterback Jeremy
Hawkinson to wide receiver Joe
McCarthy, who caught three passes
for 94 yards. Hawkinson completed
17 of 34 passes for 210 yards,

The Grinnell defense once again
had trouble containing the Rod Men
offensive attack. “They are a tailback
oriented team.” said Pioneer Head
Coach Greg Wallace. “That’s part of
their strategy—to wear down the de
fensc," he said.

The strategy succeeded as Ripon

, Grinnell defeated by conference foe Ripon, 29-14

rushed for over 300 yards on 51 at-
tempts while the Pioneers' tallied l42
yards on 24 attempts.

by corcaplains Bob Reason and Lee
Kraemer. Reason sacked the Ripon
quarterback twice and Kraemer re-
corded thirteen tackles. Comerback

tackles. Defensive and Ant Rttlhttlian

Grinnell men‘s Soccer suffered
their first conference loss against the
Cornell Rams last Thursday at home.
The Pioneers were shut out 0»1 as the
two teams were very evenly matched
throughout the game.

Grinnell had several attempts on
goal butjustcouldn'tget theirballs in
the net. The Rams executed a strong
offensiveattack andmanagedtoscore
20 minutes into the first half.

This pumped up the Grinnell de»
fense and caused them to play like
men possessed Co»captain Matt
Schrager had several amazing defen-
sive plays that helped keep Cornell
scoreless forthcremaindercf the first
half. Grinnell’s offense had some
troublewith Comell’s sturdydefense.

The first half was plagued with
poor officiating by myopic referees
and ﬂagrant body shots on several
Grinnell players. According to sopho-
more Sean Ramsey,Grinnell took the
field ready to “crack some skulls."

Seeond»half play was very quick-
paced and rough with plenty of el-
bows tn the chest and kicks to the
head. Doug Hodum suffered a wrist
injury butcontinued to play fervently
till the end of the match.

Grinnell had difﬁculty bringing
the ball downfield and failed ID score
during the rest of the game.

Grinneﬂ was ready for their next
opponent, Knox Siwash. From the
onset of the match it was painfully
evident that Grinnell outmatchtx‘l the

Siwash. Grinnell had several shots on
goal but failed to score until frosh
Zack Dietz scored 30minutes into the
firs t-half.

Grinnell’s defense was strong
enough to keep the ball on the Pio-
neers' offensive end and fresh keeper
Nate Brennamen didn'ttouch theball
in the first-half. Grinnell's fullbacks.
Erich Giebelhaus, MattSchrager, Tim
Edmunds, and Doug Hodum, made
the Knox Siwash look highly inexpe-
rienced.

The ﬁrstvhalfended with Grinneil
on top 1-0.

Grinnell's first score of the game
came when sophomore Papa Owusu
had a lightening fast breakaway in
which he dribbled circles around two
stunned Siwash defenders and earned
an assist when a Grinnell player
scored. Five minutes later, junior sena
sation Bntno Alieke navigated the
ball downfteld and took the Siwash
defenders by stom,scoring6rinneil’s
third goal of the day.

Frosh Bertrand Behm later scored
onan assist from Alickc, bringing the
score to a 4-0 Grinnell advantage.

Two and ahalf minutes later, frosh
Dietz scored his second unassisted
goal. This put Grinnell up by ﬁve.

especially during the second-half."
