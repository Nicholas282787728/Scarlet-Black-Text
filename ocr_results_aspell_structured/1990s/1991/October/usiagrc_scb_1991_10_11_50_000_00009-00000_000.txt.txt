: Futuristic dystopia seen in
, sci-fi classic Blade Runner

By Louise Alcom

Directed by Ridley Scott, this
1982 film has becomea film noircult
classic. Its amazing (and incredibly
expensive) special effects are only a
part of its appeal. Blade Runner's

' lass-thanrutopian image of the future

isacynicrti and frightening commenr
tary on the human condition.
Advertisments that constantly pro
mote “a new life“ remind the rag-lag

, crowd that life on Earth is less than

idyllic.

In 215t»century Los Angeles, a
cynical and disillusioned cop, played
by Harrison Ford, is assigned to track

down and kill a group of renegade
androids who have come to Earth to
find theircreator. These“replicants"
are seeking to prolong their shortpre-
programmed life spans. Unexpected

fuicolleagueandabeautifulreplicant,
played by Sean Young.

This movie is based on the book
Do AndroidtDream o/Eleciric Sheep
by Philip Dick. More than once I
have heard this sci—ft flick described
as “the best ever." You'll have to
decide for yourself, but it’s certainly
one heck of a ride! BladeRttnner will
be shown on Saturday and Sunday
evenings at 8:30 in North Lounge.

Spike Lee looks at jazz
life in Mo’ Better Blues

By Brendan Riordan

After the multitudes of critical acr
claim for Spike Lee‘s 1989 hit Do

) The Right Thing, many eagerly

awaited the young filmmaker’s next
project, with hopes for another con-
troversial, powerful film.

However, rather than immedi-
ately tackling another equallycontro-
versial topic, Lee opted for a jazz
picture, in an attempt to enter into and
rise above another current film trend.
Clint Eastwood’s Bird had just been

. released, received critically as me-

diocre at best, and word had hit the
street that Woody Allen had plans
for a new film dealing with a jazz
musician (later to be entitled Alice).

/ As Lee himself said, “First Clint
.‘ Eastwood, and now Woody Allen!

Youknowlcouldn’tletWoody Allen
doajazz film before I did. I was on a
mission."

What Lee emerged with was M a'
BelterBlues, an astounding film with
both great music and brilliant perfor-
mances by Denzel Washington, Joie
Lee (Spike‘s sister). Bill Nunn (the
actor who played Radio Raheem in
Do the Right Thing), and the late,
great comedian Robin Harris. The
film was not all that well received,
due to its lack of a truly profound
statement. Mo' Better Blue: is, how
ever, brilliantly photographed, and
the plot is both solid and intruiging,
with the exception of a cheesy life-
sequence montage which nearly
spoils the film’s ending. Mo' Better

Jonah: an optimistic film
about eight Swiss idealists

By Brett Fechheimer

Jonah Who WillBe 25 in the Year
2000 is a refreshingly original com»
edy. A Swiss film (how often will
you have a chance to see one of
these?),releasedin 1976,10nah brings
us vingettes from the lives of eight
somewhat eccentric characters, all
of who were impacted by and, to
varying degrees. involved in the po~
litical and social upheavals of the
late 1960’s.

Jonah is an optimistic film, con-
tradicting the generallyrheid belief
that the 705 were a time ofcynicism
and disillusionment for the idealists
who were at the height of their influ-
ence in 1968 (a tumultous year in
both the US, and Europe). The eight
characters, who become friends dur-
ing the course of the movie, have
created their own unique niches in a
society much changed by the revolu-
tionary events of almost a decade
beforeﬁ events in which most of the
characters participated.

Marcel, forexample, hopes to solve
society‘s problems by studying the

behavior of animals. His wife Mar-
guerite strongly believes in the value
of organic farming. Marie, another
character, is a supermarket cashier
who steals food for poor senior citi-
zens, Marco is a high school teacher
whose unorthodox style gets him in
trouble with the administration.

Because it introduces its charac—
ters through a series of very personal
vingettcs (a cinematic device seen
most recently in last summer’s
Slacker),10nah provides the viewer
with heartfelt glimpses into the lives
of some very intriguing people. One
gets the impression that these charac-
ters, politically active in years past,
are only resting and gaining strength
for battles yet to come. Hence the
forward-looking title,

Directed by Alain Tanner, Jonah
Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 was
almost unaminously praised when it
was first released in the United
States, fifteen years ago this month.
As pan of the Cultural Film Series,
Jonah will be shown on Friday and
Saturday at 8:00 pm. and on Sunday
at 2:00 pm, in ARH 302.

The Old Wife's Tale is a folk tale
