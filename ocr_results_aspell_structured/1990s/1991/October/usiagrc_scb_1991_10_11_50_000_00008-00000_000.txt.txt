her work here

The Kingﬁrher was followed in
1985 by What the Light Was Like, in
which her rich metaphors and keen
response to the world again won her
critical acclaim. Her third collection
of poetry, Archaic Figure, was pub-
lished in 1987. In Figure, Clampitt
explores the experience of women,
both as individuals, and as a part of
human history. Though there are the
evocations of Maine, Greece. En-
gland, and her native Midwest that
were in her previous collections, the
focus in Figure is on tlte classic and
modern female‘s experience.

With Westward, published in 1990,
Clampitt shows herself to be a poet
of place, with incredibly rich dc-
scriptions. In the magniﬁcent long
poem that ends the collection, she
crafts a vision of the pulse of life
throughout the generations

Clampitt‘s most recent collection
is entitled Predecesmrs, Eta, and it
funher entrenches her standing as
one of this country's most admired

poets.

By Jennifer Stukas

The scene 15 familiar: two friends
take off in search of adventure. They
commit a murder and begin a crime
Spree that lasts until their inevitable
demise. This basic plot is reminiscent
of almost every malcrbuddy, Westr
cmrinlluenced outlaw movie ever
made. But the outlaws of last May's
Thelma and Louise are women and
their vicums are men. and this fact
has caused conﬁovcrscy.

The story begins when Thelma
(Geena Davis), a thoroughly taken-
for-grantcd housewife. and Louise
(Susan Sarandon). a waitress at a
diner, decide to drive to a friend’s
cabin for a weekend fishing trip.
Thelma, who‘s never before experi-
enced the Great Outdoors, decides to
takcalong her husband’s gun for pro-
tection,liftingitgingerlybythetipas
if she believes just touching it is dan-
gerous. When the two decide to stop
ata roadside bar, their lives, and this
movie, are forever altered as Thelma
is nearly taped, and Louise, taking
her own revenge for a past rape, kills
the would-be perpetrator.

Thusbcginsafatalistic crimespree
in which the crimes necessary for
survival domino. the heroines' de-
mise becomes inevitable, and yet the
story remainsthoroughlylife-affinn-
ing as the two women feel. for the
firsttimein theirlives,"ttuly awake."

For a Westem-inﬂucnced outlaw

movie, Thelma andLouire has a sur-
prisingly low body count. Any
Schwancnogger movie could beat it
by two hundredrfold. Why then the

controversy? Because Thelma and .

Louise are women who are unwilling

to be controlled by men, and for .
manypeoplethatmeans‘malerbash- .

ing." It is true that there was no true
legal or moral justification for the
original killing: Louise was simply
unwilling to chance the man’s exon-
elation if they brought the case to
court. But what is the justiﬁcation of
the slayings in any John Wayne film’i

Likewise, the other ”violated
man," the trucker. had his vehicle
destroyed because he insulted and
harassed the two women. Are the

critics who proclaimed this film .

“male-bashing” truly afraid that
women will start exploding the ve-
hicles of equally unruly men? The
action they took was determined by
the violcntprecedent set by an under

standably emotional occurrence. And ’

why shouldn't they take Ltction’.7 As
Louise said, “Whatrightdo you have
talkin' to women you don’tknow like
that?” Thus, Thelma and Louise can
bc looked at as a statement encourag-
ing women to take control of their
lives, or as a fastrpaccd buddy movie
in the spirit of Bonnie and Clyde.
Either way, it’s a damn good film.

Thelma and Louise will be shown
on Friday at 7:30 and Sunday at 3:00
in Han—is Cinema.
