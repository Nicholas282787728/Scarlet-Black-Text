A healthy dose of reality

A I had the opportunity to read a gay
' newspaper this week Okay, I con—
Y fess— I neverreally read gay papers;

can send one on an emotional roller
V coaster, People protest; people have
, bills repealed through community
action; people are beaten by police:
’ people die.
I usually skip the obituaries. They
7 always contain the life stories of men
in their 30s and 405 who’ve been
'piucked from our community by an
, “AIDSrrelated illness.” I was feeling
so mellow on this particular day that
’I skimmed even the obituaries.
One of the names, Kenneth Mar-
tin, caught my eye as vaguely family
‘ iar, so I started reading the inforrna»
< tion undemeath it. Survived by a lov-
, ing partner, bom, grew up, went to
school, yeah, yeah, what else is new.

may have taken his picture for the
school newspaper.

I raced up to the attic, where my
senior yearbook rested after follow-
ing me for three years just in case I
ever wanted it. I ﬂipped to the faculty
section, foreign languages, and there
he was. I checked the names: Ken-
neth Martin. Kenneth Martin. It was
deﬁnitely him. A teacher from my
high school, dead from AIDS at age
29.

I've been wondering recently how
longilwouldbcunLilsomeoncIknew
died of AIDS. I see my brothers and
sisters marching in the streets, and]
know they are angry, but I do not
know how they feel. I don't even
know how it feels to lose someone
close to me, let alone to lose them to
a long, painful disease that could have
been sharply curbed by education, by
awareness, Caused not by a
“lifestyle,“but by one sexual encoun-
ter with someone you don‘t know
wellt Just one time One ill-advised
fuck, and the sentence is death. No
way out.

How many other people do I know
who willdie from AIDSC7 Other leach-

ers from my high school, or students
from my class? How many people at
Grinnell?Slatisticallyspealdng,three
or four members of the college com-
munityarecarrying theI-lIV virus. At
least. Will I be reading my city’s
obituaries in ﬁve or ten years and see
a familiar name, “attended Grinnell
College," and instantly replay a men-
tal recording of that person hanging
out in the Grill, or getting mail in the
post ofﬁce? Probably.

Whatcan Ido to preventthis? [can
work for AIDS education. I can fight
homophobia. But those three or four
who have it now will still die. I can
never do enough for them. For you.

So Alanna, now that we’re all
somewhere between depressed and
terriﬁed, what’s your point? Some-
times, despite my valuable Grinnell
education, I feel like there isn’t a
point. Like I’m about to dedicate my
life to a battle against the present
reality that can never be won. At
least that I will never feel that I am
winning.

Maybe tomorrowl’llwakeup and
be able to focus on the other 1200.
And their children. Our future. I sure
hope so.

Senor Martin, gracias. Rest in

peace.

ZCry, the beloved college

"' Dear President Ferguson,
Many Grinnell students have be-

I come extremely concerned about the
) recentdecreaseinftnancialaid. I share
.in their concern. Grinnell has been

dedicated to the creation and mainte-
>nance of a truly socioeconomically
}diverse student body for sometime.

Efforts in this area of diversity have
’brought much praise to this institur
‘ tton and, more significantly, have led

to it becoming the truly unique insti-
’ tution it is today. It seems to me that
ythe recent trend towards shifting the

burden of tuition on to students with-

out consideration of their ability to

(concern.

Many noanrinneliians are con-
fused about what it is which makes

, makes this place unique is not simply

its status as a liberal arts college in
' Iowa. Weareoneamong many. What

‘ this group of students have chosen to
gather in Iowa. We come from Iowa.
* We come from the coasts. We come
from the North and the South, the
East and the West. We are the chil-

group as one can find at any institu-
tion of higher leamtng, We are what
makes this place unique.

Grinnell’s uniqueness has. of
course, not come without enormous
expense. Even for an institution as
wealthy as this one, it is a consider-
able cost toprovide the amount ofaid

which Grinnell does. No one is igno—
rant of this. Everyone is also aware
that we, like the rest of the country,
are in the midst of a recession and
therefore must cut back on expenses.
What has me concerned is the fact
that financial atd seems to be a prinr
ciplearea that is cut back. I remember
when I first came to Grinnell, the
college made a commitment that it
would work hard to make sure that no

THE REAL WORLD
The lost art of

hitchhiking

Hitchhiking, in the past decade,
has really started getting a bad rap,
Once an acceptableand logical mode
oftransportation forboth theindigent
and the student (which, after all, are
so frequendyone and the same), hitch»
hiking in the 805 and 905 has become
the word to use in order to freak your
parents into financing your travel
“Look, Dad, either you pay my plane
faretoSanFrancisco,orI’lljusthitchr
hike!" is a phraseguaranteed to make
anxious parents grab for their wallets,
certain that any hitching attempts are
bound to end up in full-scale carnage.

Although I can’t, ofcourse, argue
that hitchhiking is always safe. I can
say that when tempered with com-
mon sense. it can be a creative and
cheap way to get from point A to
point B. Of course, it‘s important to
be relatively responsible~never do
it alone, or at night, since both habits
are undeniably dangerous, Overa few
years of practice. I‘ve been picked up
by some pretty bizarre folks, but I‘ve
yet to run into anything really fright—
ening.

A couple of weeks ago I hitched
down the road to Iowa City with my
friend Michaelt It was beautifuli
one of those golden examples of hiteha
hiking as an art form. where you get
picked up as soon as you set foot on
the highway and geta ride all the way
to your desired destination. And the
ridcitself—well, itwas interesting, to
use a weak adjective

Our driver was a trucker with a
“To hell with the Supreme Court, you
burn my flag, 1‘11 kick your ass“ T-
shin, driving for a small company
we‘d never heard of. He, on the other
hand, had never heard of Grinnell
College.

In search of a genteel icebreaker.
we started discussing the Milwaukee
murders.

“You know," the truck driver told
us, pensiveiy. “I ran into a driver the
other day at a stop who said, ‘You
know, those murders don't really
bother me too much. He was only
killing fags."

Michael and I both opened our
mouths pretty fast, but before we
even got a chance to respond to that
gem, he went on to say, shaking his
head a little, “And I said to myselfi
now, I could be wrongibut there‘s
something aboutthatattitude thatjust
doesn‘t seem nice.”

And he was one of the saner ones.

When hilchhiking around Atlanta
a couple of summers ago, some
friends and I werepicked up by a true
blue stereotype of a Southem Rebel.
who despite cenain ideological dif-
ferenceson the likelihood of whether
or not “die South was gonna RIIISE
again. dammir!“, proved to be quite

hospitable. Taken in stride, it was
much more of a mantra than a threat.

'I‘heconversationprogressedalong
the lines of things like “Yup, things
sure ain't so good down here now for
jobs—but the South’s gonnaRIIIISE
again, dammit" or “Well, I know we
gots some problems heah with our
lil’ ol’ edy—cation system, but-” and
so forth Joseph Campbell would
have described him as an individual
who'd developed his personal my—
thology to an artforrn. He dropped us
off exactly where we needed to go,
too, tipping his rebel ﬂag baseball
Cap and Calling me a “sweet little
lady," which revealed that he was
harboring a whole slew of miscon-
ceptions.

On the flip side, it‘s notjust driv-
ers that can be fun. In Canada, for
instance, Michael and I picked up a
trio ofhitchhikers from Toronto who
were more entertaining than themovie
