RECORDS

 

Green Mind is warmer and less

Green Mind - Dinosaur 'Jr.

Despite rumors of their extinction, Dinosaur has released its
fourth blockbuster album. This record is more of a J. Mascis solo
outing than a band effort, though. Mascis‘s music has evolved
somewhat in the long period since Bug, Dinosaur‘s last album.

maybe the band should be called Woolly Mammoth Jr. now. So if
you buy this album expecting to hear the roaring thunderrlizards of
yore, you mightbe disappointed, but this album is no slouch, My
favorite tracks are the mildly funky “Muck" and the title track, but
the album is consistently high quality rock music. So go buy it.

Miller to give art lecture

on Chartres

By Michael Kavanagh

Malcolm Miller, a world-re-
nowned authority on the Medieval
French cathedral of Chartres, will
present a lecture this afternoon at
4:15 in ARH 302.

Miller has spent the majority of
his life dedicated to this cathedral.
He was educated at Durham Unir
versity in Great Britain, where hc
majored in French, and spenta year
in the town of Chartres studying the
cathedral to write his ﬁnal honors
paper. Now Miller is regarded as
one of thepremier authorities in the
world on Chartres.

Miller has written three authori-
tative books on Chartres and has
appeared on several British radio
and television broadcasts. Since
1958, his main occupation hasbeen
guiding tours of the cathedrali Over
the past 33 years, Miller estimates
he has taught several hundreds of
thousands of visitors about the
wonders of Chartres.

A classic example of Gothic are
chitecture, Charues’ construction
was begun in the late 12th century.
The cathedral houses a piece of the
Virgin Mary's childbirth tunic, and
therefore attmcted thousands of
pilgrims from all over Europe dur-
ing the Middle Ages, becoming the
center {or the Cult of the Virgin,
These pilgrimages brought wealth
and prosperity to the town of
Chartres. Great'feasts, such as that
heldon ttheastofthe Assumption,
attracted especially large groups of
pilgrims and added even more
wealth to the cathedral’s treasury,
The cathedral was vital in the daily
life of the town as well, serving as

cathedral

a marketplace, meeting place, and
court of law.

With Medieval iconography as
his specialty, Mtllcr will no doubt
speak at length about the elaborate
stained glass display for which
Chartres is famous. Theinnovation
ofthe flying buttress helped toalle-
viate stress in the roof and to
strengthen the interior vaults, thus
opening up the walls and allowtng
windows to be added. The stained
glass in Chartres graphically den
picts stories, the basic purpose of
which was to educate the largely
illiterate congregation who could
neither read the Bible nor under-
stand the Larin masses they at
tended. The gigantic rose window
which dominates the west end of
the cathedral is one of the best
known symbols of Gothic art in the
world

Duringwinlerbreak,Miller gave
a special tourto a group of Grinnell
students and faculty who were in
France on the Interim Study Tour,
Megan Miller, a Grinnell student
who participated, said, ”The tour
lasted about an hour and a half, but
I would have listened all day there,
because the it was so interesting.
Mr. Miller was a very dynamic and
excitingspeaker.You couldn’thelp
but be interested in what he was
telling you. He wasjust so knowl-
edgeable and enthusiastic!"

loy Brown, who also partici-
pated in the tour, was most iakenby
Miller's vast knowledge of the
symbolism which one finds in
abundance at Chartres. “He seemed
to know everything! Some of the
stories which the windows and
sculptures tell are fascinating."

Professor Cervcne shows "New Paintings".

By Elizabeth Banﬁeld

“New Paintings" is the title of
the small but potent show of Pro-
fessor Richard Cervene's recent
works now on display at the Grin-
nell Community Center. In this
show, Ccrvene has integrated wa-
tercolors and oil paintings in order
to enliven the small exhibition
space.

The watercolor works utilize
collage, bright hues, and visible
brush technique to entice the viewer
to closer inspection. Cervene’s inr
tegration of technique and design
elements endow the works with a
particular intrigue that is quite ap»
propriate for the closcrrange view-
ing necessary in the gallery. He

Cervene‘soilpaintingscommu-

ing,” a calculated manipulation of
color designed to elicit an emo-
tional reaction from the observer.
In these works, he abandons repre-
sentational forms 20 Concentrate
fully on the relationship between
color and emotion. Cervcne ex
plained that he dilutes the oil pig-
ment to develop this relationship.

The choice of colors is a key
factor to the success of these works.
Salsa Sky is composed of vivid or-
ange and blue that entivens the

ported by the large scale of the
works, The incorporation of color
and scale gives the oil paintings a
bold presence.
