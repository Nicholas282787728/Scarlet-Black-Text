The realities of sexism

If more male employees are promoted to administrative status than
female employees during a reorganization of employee status, if professors

call upon more males than females in class, if more women than men are
dissatisﬁed with the amount of input they have at Grinnell College/"might
these disparities be the results of sexism at Grinnell?

We think so. While no one on campus would say that she or he
openly supports sexism, none of us are immune to its inﬂuence. Often,
sexism is notaconscious force behind our decision~making; instead,it subtly
inﬂuences the way we think, act and perceive ourselves and others.

Sexism is less overt these
days: it lurks behind our conscious STAF F
mind and is evidence of the society
inwhich weare socialized. It reaches E D ITORIAL
us through many mediums, from
beer advertisements, to movies, to US history textbooks that omit the
contributions of women to the buildings of our nation. The Iowa comfields
that separate Grinnell from the restoftheworlddo notprotecrourcommunity
from the inﬂuences of a sexist society.

Often, we pretend that sexism, exhibited both by males and fe4
males, doesn't exist at Grinnell. We don't want it to exist here. We don't
like it That doesn't mean we should ignore the reality that it does exist or
attribute its symptoms to other causes.

Perhaps an awareness about whether sexism inﬂuences our deci-
sion-making process will lessen its impact on our decisions. If we look out
for sexism, maybe we can avoid some of his pitfalls.

This effort for greater awareness and introspection is imperative.
The current effetcts of sexism at Grinnell should not be ignored, The
presence of sexism on campus has had an adverse effect on people‘s jobs.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Alternative education

To the editor,

l’dliketotellLheScarletartdBlac/c
why I've become so hateful toward
all other human beings. except for
Governor Branstad, Otto and Willard
Scott.

One day I was walking down the
beautiful streets of Grinnell, away
from theelite institution I attend, when
an African American, Asian Ameri-
can, Caucasian, Jewish, Christian,
Moslem, homo, bi, hetero, male, fe-
male, fat, short, thin, tall, bald Euro-
pean came over to me and said, “Are
you a boy?"

“Yes,” I said, not knowing how
else to respond.

“You look it,” he said. “And you
look fluffy."

This,coupledwithmy friendJose’s
experience in a Turkish prison, has
caused my hatred of all human be»
ings.

Some other things I hate:

A farmer from Wisconsin made

Kent strikes

To the editor,

Josh Ford‘s column in last week‘s
Scarlet and Black really cracked me
up. I especiallyliked his references to
Terry Brandstad, Tom Tauke, and
John Sununu. It’s great to see such a
high degree of political competence
in the Scarlet andBlack‘s writers and
editors,

Shelly West’s column was also
very enlightening. I personally had
no idea she was a queer before that
column. I think what Grinnell needs
is for its gay community to ho a bit
more vocal, don’t you?

Lastbutnotlcast,PeaceDay.What
a great idea. A chance for students to
hear about some issues they might
not otherwise hear about at Grinnell.

fun of my body odor. Now I have a
deep revulsion for all dairy productsi
except whipped cream.

A cashier at Hy Vee overcharged
me on my lastpurchase of Vanilla ice
Cream, Now Ihateall foodexceptegg
whites, white bread, alpine chocolate
and mayonnaise.

A woman working at Record
World made fun of my decision to
purchase a Nelson CD. Now I hate all
music except Whitesnake, Great
White, Vanilla Ice and The White
Album.

And finally,I was keptwaiting for
20 minutes at McDonalds for my
happy meal, so I hate all restaurants
except White Castle.

I hope you all now understand my
pent-up anger, because Iknow you all
care so much.

And hey. why limit “Peace Day" to
activities related to peace’.7
Ecofeminism, multi»ethnicity, cul-
tural relationships with the environ-
ment, all these make for fascinating
discussions on the topic of“peace.”l
can’t wait for “Earth Day." Maybe
then we can talk about the major new
US. role in the Middle East peace
process under a Republican presi-
dent, or the glorious success of the
conservative “containment" military
strategy with respect to the Soviet
Union.

Boy, I sure love Grinnell. In five
years when those phonathon people
give me a call, I know I’m going to
dig deep, and give ‘til it hurts.

apologizes

for student

behavior

To the editor,

As the Hall Activity Coordinator
of James Hall, I would like to offi-
cially offer an apology to the resi-
dents and staff of Gates Hall for the
surprise attack of Friday, September
5.While the ideawas meanttobefun,
people have been offended by it, and
I apologize for that.

IfI were to do this over again, I
would have changed several things.
This should nothave been kept secret
to begin with: rather, you and the
occupanu of Gates Hall should have
been informed well in advance that
we were coming. Also, the idea to
carry outthe activities indoors should
have been scraped from the begin
ning. I personally should have stayed
to help Kendra Losee, the Hall Activ-
ity Coordinator of Gates I-Iall, clean
up the mess made by the members of
my hall. This was an oversight on my
account, but this is no excuse.

As for the phone calls that were
made to most. if not all. the North
Campus halls, I had no part in this
matter, nor did I have any knowledge
that they were being made until after
they were made. .

I made a mistake in allowing this
activity to be carried out in the way
that it was. For that, I am sorry.

All you need is a note from mom

Idid something very unusual this
week. It didn’t involve a death-defy-
ing stunt or breaking with all social
conventions. In fact, it may not even
seem all that unusual to the common
person. But it was the first time I‘d
done it in my Grinnell career, and I
suspect that I may not be alone.

I took a sick day.

Idon’tmeanthatlsleptanextra20
minutes,then dragged my butttoclass
anyway. [actually stayed in bed until
I felt like getting up, then stayed in
my nightshirt. and Warm socks while
I moved into the living room for a
change of scenery.

I tried to remember the last time I
had actually decided to take the day
off due to illness. It was definitely in
high school. Back then, if you were
sick, you had to decide to be sick for
the whole day. You couldn’t come in
after lunch, or show up only for the
extracurricular activities. I realized

that this would be a way to actually
get some rest, sol made a few neces-
sary phone calls and ignored for the
entire day the impulse to wander to-
ward ARI-i.

lie-creating those childhood days
was reassuring, sometimes even fun.
Iplunked down on the couch with the
remote control and a glass of juice.
The most inane shows seemed vastly
more entertaining than staring at the
ceiling over my bed. Sally Jessy
Raphael was discussing overweight
teenagers. I found myselfcompellcd
to listen to their stories of harassment
at school, of having no friends, I re
mcmbered my own overweight,
friendless years in elementary and
junior high school and realized that I

should take more time to appreciate
how far I‘ve come since then.

Sally's guest was Richard
Simmons. It so happens that] always
liked Richard andhis almost spiritual
approach to weight loss, and it was
good to see him again. I’d been won,
dering how he was doing, and in case
anyonecctres, he's doingjust fine. He
preached to abelieving audience, and
his gospel was to believe in yourself.
A simple, yet often underestimated,
guide to live by.

When Sally was finished, I started
ﬂipping channels again. The best of
fcring at 11:30 was a PBS documen-
tary on Romanesque and Gothic ca-
thedrals. I was transformed, through
videotape and my imagination, from
a disheveled, coughing student into
an English peasant, so dependent on
religion that I would donate cvcry
