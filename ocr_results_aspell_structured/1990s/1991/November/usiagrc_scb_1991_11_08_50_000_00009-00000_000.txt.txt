2001 takes Viewer on odyssey
through space and time

By Rhys Jones

2001:A Space Odyssey is a beau—
tifulpicturebasedonastorybyAnhur
C. Clarke. He and Stanely Kubrick
wrote the screenplay and Kubrick
spent the next three years shooting it,
beginningin 1965, The story, such as
it is, can be synopsized but can it be
understood? For the ﬁrst half hour or
so, the audience is treated to me
dialogless sight and grunts of a tribe
of apes, circa four million years ago.
From there. the ﬁlm takes off, as the
black monolith turns the cavorting
vegetarians into territorial. camivo-
rous apes, who begin using bones as
tools.

And in perhaps the ﬁlm’s most in-
famous sequence, a bone is tossed
into the air, and becomes a spaceship
in the year 2001, The ﬁlm follows
mankind in what is apparently one of
our most important times, KeirDullea
(David Bowman), Gary Lockwood
(Frank Poole), and Sylvester (Dr.
Heywood Floyd) are astronauts
aboard ajoint Soviet-US. mission to
the Lunar surface. Unbeknownst to

Murder and

intrigue

the astronauts. there has been a tre-
mendous discovery upon the moon’s
surface,onethatthegovemmentfears
would cause panic on earth. The in-
credible shipboard computer, HAL
9000, plays a striking rolein the ﬁlm,
as it begins to suffera “nervous break
down” due to the intensely conflict-
ing goals in the mission.

From the moon to Jupiter to the
realm of the supematural, humanity ’s
next leap forward is depicted with
stunning brilliance in one of the ﬁnest
ﬁlms of our time.

The ending of the ﬁlm has caused
much confusion among moviegoers
notfarniliar with the book. The direc-
tor, Kubrick, was delighted by this
confusion, and maintained that he
deliberately kept questions unan-
swered in order to pique the curiosity
of the audience. However, familiarity
with the book is not essential to the
comprehension of this ﬁlm‘s ending.
1f viewed with close attention to de-
tail. and an open mind, most of this
ﬁlm is relatively straightforward.
2001 will be shown on Sunday at
8:30 pm. in Nonh Lounge.

Hitchcock’s Strangers On a Train

By Brendan Riordan

Having recently regained public
attention forits inﬂuence on theBilly
Crystal/Danny DeVito ﬁlm, Throw
Momma From the Train, this ﬁltn
can be most quickly conjured up to
mind by the haunting words
“criscross, criscross.”

Made by the great Alfred
Hitchcock in 1951, this ﬁlm iswidely
known for its beautiful and exten~
sive location photography. Strang-
ers opens with an interesting charac-
ter study, showing nothing but a
close-up of shoes. We see these
shoes move from ataxi toatr'ain, one
pairaconservativemonochromeand
the other a gaudy brown and white.

The shoes are then revealed to
belong to two total strangers, who
happen to sit next to each other on a
train. One is a tennis champ. torn

between his relations with his current
wife and his current lover. The other
isa brash societyplayboy whoutterly
loathes his father. The playboy sug-
gests that since the tennis champ’s
wife won’t give him a divorce, he
should kill the playboy's father and
the playboy will. in rum, murder his
wifw resulting in two entirely mo-
tiveless murders. The tennis champ
dismisses it all as ajoke until his wife
is found dead, and he ﬁnds himself
without an alibi, Inevitably, the play-
boy arrives, dcmanding that the ten
nis champ kill his father, fulﬁllinghis
end of the bargain.

This ﬁlm (although the dialogueis
not as strong as it could have been)
spins a diabolical web, both absorbr
ing and provocative, in which the
psychological implications of social
behavior are not elaborated upon but
merely exposed.

C addyshack

Caddy/shack is a silly, gag-packed ﬁlm with a cast of well-known TV stars. Enomrously popular
when itwas ﬁrst released in 1980, Caddyshack seems to havepaved me way forall the silly, gag—packed
ﬁlms with casts of well-known TV smrs which followed it. In a nutshell, this ﬁlm— which takes place
at your typical exclusive country club; pits a way uncool, anal~retentive snob (Ted Knight) against
a troika ofArtimalHouse-esquecinematic heroes: an obnoxiously-dressedboor (Rodney Dangerﬁeld),
a studmufﬁn-cum-psychobabble golf champ (Chevy Chase), and abumblin g gopher-hunting gardner
(Bill Murray ). And don‘t miss the Baby Ruth-in-the-pool scene! Cuddyshack will be shown on
Saturday at 8:30 pm. in North Lounge. -Brett Fechheimer

Kindergarten Cap

Released duringlastyear‘s holiday season, when America’s tolerance forschmaltzand mushiness was
higher than usual, Kindergarten Cap stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a render-hearted cop (surprise!)
who goes undercover to teach a class of Oregon kindergartenersl 1 will admit to never understanding
Schwarzenegger‘s appeal, so I‘ll refrain from prejudicing you with a cynical review of this ﬁlm. Let's
leave it at this: you'll probably ﬁnd that Kindergarten Cop will bring a smile to your face. And it will
probably be the same sort of smile that comes from looking at a storefront window ﬁlled with toy trains
and plastic elves. Kindergarten Cup will be shown tonight at 7:30 pm, in the Harris Cinema

-Brett Fechheimer

Misery

Starring both James Cann and Cathy Bates (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting
Actress) and directed by Rob Reiner (or Meathead, of All in the F :1me fame),M isery is one of the fittest
of many attempts to adapt Stephen King’s novels to the screen. This is not an easy task. considering
the fact that most of Mirery’saction takes place in one room. The room serves as ahospital/torture room
in which a psychotic nurse “cares for" and terrorizes a crippled writer, the victim of a car accident in
an isolated Maine forest, who also happens to be her idoll The suspense mounts as the writer attempts
both to recover from his accident and to make his escape from the nurse‘s lairl Misery will be shown
on Saturday at 7:30pm. and on Sunday at3100 pm. in the Harris Cinema. -Brendan Riordan
