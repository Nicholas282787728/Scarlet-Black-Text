results “Itwas a successful break. In
a short amount of time we were able
to work with a large numberofagen—
cies, some of which we had never
worked with before," Ford Said. The
Alternative Break is an excellent op
portunity for those who do not have
time for community service while
classes are in session according to
Ford.

Ford also stressed that the work
performed was not necessarily large
in nature. but in fact many smaller
manual laborjobs which the various
organizations could not get done
themselves. “Anything wewcreable
to do for the agencies, no matter how
small, is important,” Ford said.
