Dancers of It’s An African Thing, You Wouldn’t Understand

Black Talent Show raises
cultural awareness

By Ted Schenkelberg

Several hundred people packed
the Harris Center IaStFriday for the
third annual Black Student Talent
Show Theaudience. manyof which
were friends and relatives of the
performers, was treated to a night
of African and African—American
culture and entertainment

Noel Green hosted the Show; his
relaxed and Spontaneous humor
played well off the responsive and
energetic audiencer A lively dance
routine called “Attention!" opened
the evening by combining modem
dance with traditional dances from
South Africa and Kenya.

In oneoflhebiggestcrowdpleas-
ing acts, the men of ”foo Damn
Hype" proceeded to Show off black
urban pop culture. Led by Am
Vasailis' deft and Smooth moves
and Marcus Jackson’s hip action.
they moved in a choreographm
dance to “Everybody DanceNoW,"
The women of “Six Pack” also
showed off their stuff in a well—
coordinaled dance routine.

Other acts such as “Black Ste»
reotypes Revisited" and "We Wear
the Mask“ reﬂected a more serious
and biting Side of African-Ameri-
can life by dealing with racism and
its effects. The poem "A Tribute to
Black Women,“ read by Tandeka
Stanback. dealt with the inner
beauty of black women who over»
come pain and setbacks to improve
themselves and the future.

For the ﬁnal act. producer Shan-
non Hancock read a poem called
“Blackness is. ..," which called for
unity, love, and community. All the
black membersol‘ the audienccwcrc
asked to join Hancock and the rest
of the performers on Stage for an
impromptu singing of the national
anthem of the African National
Congress led by Ndileka Mbalot

Perhaps the only complaint
voiced by a few students in the
audience was the lack ofnon-black
students in the show Many of the
performers explained that the tal-
entshow was simply away to intro
duce black culture to a campus that
does not see it very often, and that

nonrblack students were not at all
discouraged in taking part.
Overall. lhelalentshowptovided
a very enjoyable mixture of Afri-
can and African-American enterr
lainment, culture and awareness
while allowing many students to
