:Why Duke wins votes

. Late last month, David Duke won
-a shot at the govemorship of Louisi—

ana. Duke was harshly condemned
«by the establishment, which was ap-
yalled that tltis man, whom it feared

and hated more than any other ﬁgure
‘in Americanpolitics.mightwtn higher
.office.

Ltstening to Bush and his Iackeys,
'one might think that Duke ts a Nazi,
vembellishing his campaign by giving
'Nazi salutes and reading passages

from Mein Kampf. If this were true,
‘then all the sound and fury would be
Justified. Butin reality, Duke, though
formerly a Nazi. solemnly repudiates
‘his reprehensiblepast, and hiscurrent
.agenda has nothing to do with his old
one.

Duke has staked out territory aban-
«doned long ago by the mainstream
.Right, whose spokesmenilack

Kemp, Fred Barnes, Dan Quaylk
‘are depressingly willing to compro-
J'nise with the Left on taxes, welfare,

and affirmative action. He employs a
”brand of Right-wing Populism not
.seen since thedaysofGeorgc Wallace.
Why is it so effective? The answer
'can’tsimplybebigotry,becausemuch
of Duke’s agenda has nothing to do
.Wilh race.

“Middle American Radicalism"7a
movement comprised of middle and
lowermiddleclass Americansfed up
wrth the domesttc policies of the
establishment's liberals and pseudor
conservatives, who seem insulated
front social reality. They feel, with
justification, that these policies have
benefited others at their expense.
As Leroy Corey pointed out, King
George III’s appropriation of three
percent of Americans’ income was a
main impetus for the revolution, but
Congress taking 46% is business as
usual.ToTed Kennedy,JoeBiden,or
an even putatively conservative sena—
tor like Orrin Hatch, three percent
would be unthinkably low, If Con-
gressisgoingtotake46%,itshouldat
least spend it on things that would
benefit taxpayers, like better law ene
forcement. But it squanders literally
billions on arcane projects like ﬂying
cows to Europe, the “Search for Ex-
traterrestrial Life Program," and, as
Corey famously noted, research on

the mating habits of homosexual

tax money is wasted.

It’seasytounderstandwhymiddle
Americans resent welfare. Through
it, their moneyithe fruit of hard
work—is taken from them and ”re
distributed“ to people who, in many
cases, don’t work. Moreover, mothr
ers on AFDC bear more chtldren than
they can raise with any care, because

Duke told supporters in New Orleans
about a man who had impregnated
halfa dozen women just so that “he
can have more money for his Friday
night card game,” Who would not
find this unjust and absurd?

Whites are understandably resentr
ful when they find themselves losing
positions to minorities advancing
solely because they 're minorities. The
crowning insult is that “affirmative
action." as it’s called, is practiced in
the name of “civil rights.” Once the
phrase“civilrights”meantsomething
admirable; today, it is used to dignify
Leftist fetishes. It is also used as a
political tool: anyone who opposes

Harassment does not equal power

A swastika. If a person were to
shoose a symbol or word with which

choose nothing more powerful than
'Hitler's hated emblem. I don’t know
(what the person who repeatedly placed
swastikas on the residencerhall door

ePerhaps they thought it was funny?
‘Maybe they didn’t understand the

deep meaning that symbol holds for

‘Jews. Possibly they didn‘t think it

didn't know that such a speciﬁc act is
‘against the law in Iowa. Frankly, I

effect, an assault on every Jewish

I found out about the incident on
”Friday afternoon through the Jewish

communication for our small com-

belief, This couldn’t happen at

You must understand why,

A swastika represents not only the
horror that the Jews of Europe expe-

a reminder of similar horrors that
occurred in Russia in 1881. Spain in
1492, the Crusades, the Soviet Union

and the Dreyfus affair in France.
Throughout history Jews have been
the victims of oppression and perser
cution. For the most part this has not
been our fate in the United States;
more subtle forms of antirSemitism
have occurred, but nothing on the

THROUGH
DRINKING

GLASS

Dear Grandma

Grandparentsarewonderful.Who
else would cherish pictures of you
thatyou would rathersee torn to shreds
by a pack of wild dogs? Who else
would send you a huge thank you
card, obviously written through tears
ofpurejoy. forsending them aMickey
Mouse spoon on their anniversary?
Only Grandma and Grandpa.

But it has come to my attention
thatmost of you out theredon’tbother
to write to your grandparents. A vari-
etyofexcusesaregiven.“I’m waiting
for them to send me a care package."
“Why should I? They aren’t going to
send me any moneth'I‘hey’re dead,“
(Well, okay, I can understand that
one.) But by far, the most popular
response is, “I can’t tell them whatl
do here! Are you nuts? They would
suffer massive coronaries if they lmew
what I was doing in college!"

I can understand this problem. I
love my Grandma, Trouble is, Icart't
seem to write letters to her, See, I
have this idea (only a theory, mind
you) that she wouldn’taltogether ap-
prove of what I do at college I don’t
know of too many grandparents who
really want to hear the drinking tales
of their grandchildren. And seeing as
how that’s aboutall I do here, I don‘t
have much else to write about

So, I learned to lie.

Not big lies or anything. Just half-
truths. Omissions of certain facts.
Things like that.

My brother and I sometimes call
each other and try to sort out what is
fit for Grandma’s ears and eyes.

“So, Erich, do you think I should
tell her about the big pany with eight
kegs this weekend?”

”No, Elisa, she might not be as
impressed with your belching prize
as my fraternity brothers were Why
don‘t you just say something to the
effect of how you hung out with
friends and enjoyedeachother‘scom-
pany?"

He‘s helpful sometimes.

So, usually ljust make up stuff
about how I'm so busy going to
classes. or I’m spending far too much

time in the library these days,

Okay, so those are big lies, I can‘t
help it. I can only talk about the
weatherinlowa forso many pages,A
typical letter contains the following
imponant true facts: how stinky the
weather is at this very moment; how
sorry I am to hear about the latest
injury/sickness of a family member;
how much work I have to do in my
classes (no mention,however,of how
little of it I am actually doing); how
wonderful my friends are.

The rest of it is pretty much a
bunch of lies. I don’t see any point in
telling her the truth about what goes
on in my life. She’s not emotionally
ready for .Ijust can’t bring myself

to send a letter like this:
Dear Grandma and Grandpa.

This weekend, my friends and I
drank a bottle of Jagermeister.
AGAIN! Can you believe it? Wow.
We werereally dntnk, and one person

ited later. We didn’t have to clean it
up, though. Thank goodness!
