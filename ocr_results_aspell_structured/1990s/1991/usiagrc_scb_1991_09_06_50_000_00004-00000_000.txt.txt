Bring back that
claustrophobic feeling

Every year, one hears the "horror" stones about firsteycar students in
overcrowded dorm rooms. Whether it's four people in a three—room triple
or six people, a cat, n Nintendo and a pool table in a Noms single. the
message is clearwthel‘c is not enough housing for the number of students
living on campus.

Plans for the new dorm have been postponed, nnd although the current
housingsituation mayindicatethnt Lhe decision to delay ancxtra residence
hall was aslntne. there is another less-costly opuon lo lncrensc housing
opportunities at Grinnelle-Lhe eollege should purchase more off-enrnpus
housing.

Both the ofﬁces of admissions
and student affairs maintain that
the unusually large number of stu-
dcnts on campus this semester is

S TA E P
not due to an increase in the num E D ITO RIAL
berofftrst-year students. Theprob-

lem arises from a combination of factors-the procedure for determining
the number of new (not ﬁrst-year) students. the number of students
studying off campus this semester and a lack of sufﬁcient housing.

The answer. then, is not necessarily to limit future class sizes of first
year students or to raise admissions standards. The solution of off-
campus housing is simple and comparatively inexpensive. A costly.
elaborate dorm. not scheduled to open for at least two to three years. does
not satisfy the numbers of upper-class students who want to live in off-
campus housing. Additional renovated, college—owned housing Would
make more dortn rooms available to incoming students and to those
returning from off—campus smdyr

Eventually, the housing crisis will be alleviated, and the horror stories
will become memories. Students will be moved around, and others will
leant to cope with unusually cozy conditions. It happens every year.
However, since it does happen every year, perhaps it's time to solve the
problem simply and efﬁciently.

Of course, what would the Scarlet and Black do without an annual
overcrowding article?

Student blames overcrowding Alcohol: The
on administration

To the editor,

Withoutinsulungthc freshmcni
oh, excuse me, ﬁrst-year-students,
l wnnt to know why there are so
many of them. Approximately 375
new students will be coming to
Campus this fall, making this class
the largestevcrtocometo Grinncll.

The inordinate Size of this class
signals one of four occurrences
within the administration, all of
which arc bad. 1, The administra-
tion does not give zt hoot about
student overcrowding. The prob-
lem has never ceased to exist, and
with more students it will certainly
be worse than ever. 2. The Grinnell
College trustees are ﬁnally getting
their long—wishedefor demand that.
thecollegeshouldincreasethenume
be! of students, a demand which
George Drake was adamantly op»
posed to, and which they may fir
nally be able to pass off to a new
president with different ideas. 3.
The Ofﬁce of Admissions has, for
the fourth year in a row, severely
overadmittcd students. Many ad-
minislnmrs have said that student

enrollment continues to increase
because more studentswantto come
. Then why do they keep 1th

' ng so many? lfadmisslons is
like thcgamble thatpcople portray,
why docs Grinncll nlwoys have a
losing hand? 4. The plan to build n
new dorm on South Campus will bc
reernerging.Wc allltnow howpopue
lar thatplan was, especially in this
rccessronary time. If more studcno
are going to conltnue to come then
something will have to be built to
house them in. Only lSO students
canlivt: in NCO houses now,mcan-
ing that the other 1250 students
(that’s an approximation) will have
to be crammed into the dorms or in
the houses.

And in the meantime, class Size
increases, waiting in lines every-
where increases, compeLition for
jobs increases and student tolere
ance for these nuisances decreases.

Good luckto the freshmen I hope
you enjoy the school when there are
1500 or more students here.

omnipresent
attraction

To the cditor,

The following is an open letter to
thc campus:

I feel that the signs that hllvc
bccn posted about campus rcadin g
“BEER” are an indication ofa very
sorry state of affairs on this cam-
pus. The signs I am referring to are
those posted by 50A in order to
gain the attention of students inter
ested in rcnttn g a refrigemlor from
them.

A fellow sludcnt explained to me
that maybe SGA was being funny.
Well, I think that it lS still a poor
excuse to rely on alcohol as an eyee
catching technique. Anything in
bold print like that would catch an
eye, such as "F00D"7 Keep it
cold with other stuff in a refrigera-
tor from 56A 1 just think that too
often alcohol is relied on too heavily
on this campus, and the fact that
SGA did so reinforces that feeling
of mine,

When the charges for dorm dam-
ages issued by Housing wereposled
on my floor at the end of last year,
I was toobusy studying for ﬁnals to
take much notice. However,whenl
received an itemized bill this sume
mcr, I responded with immediate
and absoluteincrcdulity. Whilcstue
dents and parents have largely ac-
ccptcd the current policy on dorm
charges to continuing enrollment,
many others are unhappy with it. I
am of the latter group.

My ﬁrst problem with the current
policy is that the Physical Plant
charges indiscriminately for absOA
lutelyany workthey doin thcdorms.
This summer. I paid for a fire
extinguisher thatfellfrom apoorly»
constructed wall nearly every time
the balhroom door closed. I also
paid for a “broken garbage can"
(obviously not a Hefty), and i paid
forabrokenloggiawindow (though
I lived on the third ﬂoor).

The Housing ofﬁce should notbe
charging students for work that is
the result of wear and tear in their
buildings. A wall that is weak is an
accident waiting to happen. and a
plastic garbage can Ihat "breaks"
was no doubt ready to become gar-
bage itself. With the currentpoliey,
it is a wonder students weren‘t
charged for the replacement of
bumed-out light bulbs.

Also, Housing shouldn't charge a
dorm for damage that was done
from an areaof public access,since
there is little chance of accurately

Paul Midler

assigning blame For instance, I
would suggeSl that a broken dorm
loggia window was likely caused
by anyone but someone from that
dorm. Likewise, when students are
charged for damages to computer
terrntnztl rooms, there is little guar~
antec that the damage was causcd
by people living in that donn.

My second problem with the cur-
rentpolicy is that itpromotes rather
than discourages willful miscon-
duct and vandalism. Students are
expected to confront those causing
damage to the dorms, yet students
are not all that inclined to do so. It
is simply too much work to form an
ad hoc jury every time something
breaks. Besides. when the damage
is divided by 14 or even 40 stu-
dents, it never amounts to much.
Who wants to be singled out as an
informant, a tattle-tale, for a mere
79 Cents? When the costs of de
struction are to be split among ev-
eryone, there is little to deter van-
dais.

Also, you shouldn't have to pay
for items that were faulty in the first
place.Thingsbreakdownwithtimc.
and Housing should take this into
account when determining its an-
nual budget. Similarly, Housing
should take into account that there
will be a cenain amount ofdamage
and mischief caused by students.
Fire alarms on college campuses

astongaStherehavebeen firealanns
on campuses. Windows will break.
intentionally or accidentally and,
sincc each window has two sides. it
ispointless to find anyone to blame.
Peer pressure as a deterrent to will-
ful misconductin Lhe dormitories is
a failure. Either sludcnt advisers
and resident advisots must play a
greater role in singling out people
who causedamage or another solu»
lion must he sought.

The present scheme, 1n which we
pay directly for costs that should be
accounted for indirectly. is rattler
insulting. Students and their par-
ents would no more want to be
billed for a window broken by a
passereby than they would want to
be billed for their share of what it
costs to ﬂy a professor to an aca-
demic conference or to bring in a
reggae band to campus.

Surely, there are hundreds of stu-
dents and parents who feel cheated
every year by being ﬁned for darn~
ages that are the fault of others or no
one Were Housing to account for
these costs at the beginning of the
year. many would be less annoyed,
and. at the very least, those families
who rely heavily on ﬁnancial aid
could account such costs into their
yearly request for financial assis-
lance.

The deposit for damages should
be just that—a deposit. It should
not act as padding for an insufﬁ-
cient housing budget.
