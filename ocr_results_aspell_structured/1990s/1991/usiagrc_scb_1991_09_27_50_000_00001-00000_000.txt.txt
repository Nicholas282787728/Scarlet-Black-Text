Grinnell ranked 16th in the 1991

US. News and WorldReporzranking 4

of the top 25 National Liberal Arts
Colleges, released late this week.
Grinnell was also mm in last year‘s
rankings. Grinnell also placed as the
third “best buy" of liberal arLs col-
legcs.

President Pamela Ferguson was
pleased with the ranking, pointing
out the excellence of the colleges
accompanying Grinnell in the top 25.
“I think that it is positive for the
college. I think that most of us at
Grinncll believe we should be ranked
number one, but when you look at the
list of the top 25 schools, we are in
excellent company,” President
Ferguson said.

The libctal arts category is com-
prised of 140 colleges which empha-

the liberal arts and sciences, have '*

large endowments in relation to other
schools in their region, and attract
students from a large section of the
country. The entire study included
1,373 four year colleges and univer-
sities, comprised of both survey res
spouses from 2,425 presidents, deans,
and admission directors as well as
statistics compiled by a research team.

Ferguson pointed to one criterion
in the survey, dollars spent per StuA
dent, which hurt Grinnell’s placing.
“Part of the reason our dollars spent
perstudentwcreless wasbecauseour
comprehensive fee was about $5,000
less than most of the other schools
that were in the survey." Ferguson
added that the reason thcextraSS .000

 

could be left out of the comprehen-
sive fee was Grinnell’s large endow-
ment, a factor which is not weighed
heavily in the criteria.

Grinnell actually improved in the
exclusive reputation survey accord—
ing to Richard Ridgeway, director of
public relations. “We went from 14th
in the reputation category last year to
10th this year, which shows the level
of respect for us from our peers,” said
Ridgcway.

Ferguson pointed outthatthe U. S
News general articles about the
schools could be very helpful in aid»
ing parents and students in choosing
a college matching their needs.
Ferguson also believes that the
rankings are not all that important,
adding, “We know we are doing a
good job, it’s nice to be recognized
for that. We cannot ignore the
rankings, however, because people
do look at that."

John Hopkins, director of admis-
sions, believes mat the recognition as
a top 25 liberal arts college will in-
deed help in the admissions process.
Hopkins said, ”We would like to al—
ways be in the topZS, and I am not so
sure ifyou are ranked 14th or 15th, if
that hasany true signifance." Hopkins
stressed that a minor drop in ranking,
such as lastyear’s move from 10th to
16th, would not have adverse effects
on the number of applicants to the
college.

U .S. New: calculated the "best
buy" for the liberal arts category by
determining which high ranking
schools on the list had the lowest
tuition. Washington and Lee College
and Davidson College ﬁnished first
and second, respectively. Grinnell
ranked as the third "best buy”, fol-
lowed by Occidental and Claremont
McKenna Colleges. According to
Ferguson, “It is a conscious decision
on our pan to remain a best buy, and
it is nice to be recognized for that.”

Ferguson concluded that merely
placing in the top 25 isanoutstanding
accomplishmentfor Grinnell College.
“It is imponant to remember thattherc
are over 1000 colleges and universi-
ties covered in that magazine, and
being 16th out ofthe many colleges in
our category is very, very good."

“The goal of this administration at
Grinnell College is to be an ever bet-
ter institution. Hopefully that wilibe
recognized in the (1.5. News
rankings," said Ferguson, adding, “
We will certainly notbe driven by the
rankings. Everyone likes to win, but
Grinnell is very good about keeping
its feet on the ground."
