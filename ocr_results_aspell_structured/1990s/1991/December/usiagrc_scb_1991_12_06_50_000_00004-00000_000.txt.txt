By Sharyn Obsatz

Those on campus who mourned
the recent closing of the local health
food store might rejoice over the im-
pending grand opening of Nature’s

Garden, a new health food store 10- ‘

cated on Fourth Avenue, near
Cunningham Drug.

Store owners Sally Vitera and I '

Beverly Anderson plan to open
Nature’s Garden this month, as soon
as they can get titeir inventory priced
and placed on the shelves. They will
operate the store six days a week, 9
am. — 7 pm. Monday through Fri-
day, and on Saturday mornings.
The store will carry “nothing out-
rageous,” according to Vitera. Its in~
ventory will include wheats, rices,
whole grains, chips, pop, yogurt. ice
cream bars, frozen foods, hot dogs,
wheat crust and vegetarian pizzas,
organicallygrown fniits and veg
etables in the spring, incense, pot-

Owners of the new store encourage suggestions from campus

eventually like toopen upadeliin the
basement.

The idea for a new health food
store originated with Vitera, who had
thought about setting up a diabetic
bakery, decided to broaden her plans
to include other health foods and en-
rolled in a free business course.
Through mailquestionnaires and tele-

phone surveys, Vitera and Anderson
discovered there was a real need for a
health food store in the Grinnell area.
Vitera then wrote up a proposal and
secured loans from two Grinnell
banks.

Vitera is optimistic about the
store’s future. “I really feel it will
succeed," she said.

grown from nine percent in 1987,
while the number enrolling in gradu-
ate schools has increased only five
percentage points.

of those not attending graduate
school, 70 percent intend to enroll
within five years. The smaller num-
ber of graduates finding full time
employment, combined with a merely
modest increase in graduate school
enrollments, may indicate that the
economic woes of the country are
affecting the undergraduate job
searches.

Marilyn Kurtz, Grinnell's Direc-
tor of Career Development, indicated
thatresults fortheclassof1991 would
probably notbe muchbetter. She said
fewer seniors than usual came to the

especially second semester when the
class seemed "l‘lat."She hypothesized
thatthismighthavebeentheresultof
the war and the sluggish economy,
and noted that hercolleagues atother

class success

colleges had noticed a similar inertia.

However, she is more optimistic
about the current crop of seniors,
whom she describes as “more encr-
getic” and pointed to the steady traf-
ﬁc through the career development
office since classes resumed in Au-
gust. She also observed that perhaps
because of thccurrcnt economy more
students are showinga higher level of
interest than ever before in her cxpc-
ricnce.

Among the other trends Kurtz nov
ticcd was an increasing number of
graduates entering the field of educa-
lion,whichloppedlhellsloffullrtime
jobs at 17 percent,

“Tcachingis once more an accept-
able and attractive career choice; the
salaries are stronger now across the
nation,” she explained

Also, Kurtz commented that more
students were expressing an interest
in law school while maintaining that
they had no plans to practice law. A
law degree supposedly opens up wider
possibilities of employment both in
the public and private sector, without
necessarily having to toil under the
load of a junior associate.

Some Grinnell graduates did have
difﬁculty securingemployment Only
14 percent of graduates had secured
jobs before graduation and 38 percent
had found jobs within three months
of graduation, In light of that last

McHugh believes poetry cannot be detached from life

By Alison Wade

With Yiddish proverbs, light selfr
mockery, andapoignantinquiry into
the human condition, poet Heather
McHugh entertained members of the
Grinnell community last Wednesday
in South Lounge. A successful and
extremely well-published poet and
professor, McHugh read from both
past and forthcoming works, inter-
jecting comments and personal stor
ries in a warm, relaxed manner. Al»
though herpoems addressed multiple
issues, McHugh framed her reading
with two poems about deaths which
have revolutionized her life.

“What Hell Is,” from Shades, was

written for her friend, an AIDS vic-
tim. Dcscribin g the isolation faced by
her dying friend, she read, “While we
discuss despair, he is it, somewhere
in the house. Increasingly he‘s spor
ken of, not with." This death in 1985
caused a change in her relationship
with poetry.

“I’ve always been interested in
death,“ McHugh told people after the
reading, “I’ve written about itall my
1ife.1twaslikemypetdogthatlcould
take out when I wanted it. But after
‘85, that was different. It seemed that
I wasn’tin control, that] [belonged to
death] in a way that I’d never felt
before.”

This restructuring of her relation»

ship with death was furthered by a
trip to a poets conference in Italy,
which McHugh described in “What
heThought," the lastpocm she read at
the talk. Thepoem tells the story of an
Italian martyr who was killed fordisv
agreeingwithchurchdogma.Becausc
he was an eloquent speaker, his ex-
ecutioners bound his face with an
iron mask which prevented any speech
from him before killing him in the
town square. The poem traces her
epiphany upon realizing that “Poetry
is what he thought, but could not
say.”

McHugh has become increasingly
aware, as a result of these experir
ences,that poetry cannotbedetached
from one‘s life on the whole.

“Now, I’m no longer interested in
little boxes."shesaid.“l’minterested
in the things I cannot fathom. I’m
learningthattherearenolittlepoems,
there is simply the larger singlepoem

which is your life."

It was perhaps her willingness to
personalize her poetry in this way
which made McHugh so well-re-
ceived by the audience. Lengthy ap»
plausc followed the reading, after
which she opened the floor for an
hour-long informal discussion. Topr
ics included landscapes, philosophy,
places to write, her home in Eastport,
Maine, and the Iowa Writer’s Work-
shop at which she is currently a visit-
ing professor.

Those who stayed toconvcrsewith
her felt that this intimate discussion
added an even greater understanding
of the meanings behind her poetry.

"It‘s great to get some of the per~
son thrown in. It really seems to en»
hance the poetry,” said John Post.

McHugh’s reading was sponsored
by the Noun Program in Women’s
studies, and her works are currently
available in the bookstore.
