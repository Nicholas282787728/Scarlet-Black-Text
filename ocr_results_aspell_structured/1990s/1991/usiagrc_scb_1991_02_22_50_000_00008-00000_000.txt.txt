Reggae bands to bring music with
a social and spiritual message

By David Shearer

Reggae. Bob did it best, but,
well, he’s dcadandyou'rc in Iowa.
Which is not to say that Conscious
Party and S.W.A.M.M.P., two

reggae bands that Will be paying us
a visit tonight at 9 in the Harris

Center, are anything close to cut
rate. These guys have appeared in
such places as “Roxy" in DC. and
NewYorkCity’s“ReggacLounge“
tonameascani few. Cutting tothe
chase, they know “da choice
rhydam, men” like the Colonel
knows chicken.

Ah,you ask, but me they really
worth draggin’ the old I.D. out to
go see? I think so and here's why:

Conscious Party‘s slick innovative
tuncsuremorc than exotic Carribean
excursions, they are a liberating
force as well, This group believes
that music serves the dual purpose
of communicatingartistic ideas and

social commentary (kind of an In-
digo Girls witli dreads).

powerful lyrics are augmented by
beautiful harmonies. The band‘s

The second band,
S.W.A.M.M.P. or “Sound, Wis-
dam, and Many Musical Powers,"
say that their name describes them
to a "T." This grass-roots reggae
band has been around dielamaican
scene of Negril, Ocho Rios, and
Montego Bay for about ten years,
playing “traditional Jamaican mu-
sic for the heartas well as the ears.”

Many ofthcirlyricsrel'lectbasic
Rasiafarian elements, but they also
come across as being very spiritu-
ally aware in a more general sense.
Each member of the band is a tell»

makes for some light and complex
vocal efforts.

Which band is better? If reggae
were judged on cute nicknames, I
think one kinda stands out, but hey.

Jacobshagen's landscapes
reﬂect respect for nature

 

By Seth Peterson

The earth, the sky, and the vast
ness of the horizon are all elements
of ihcgrcat space thatspreads across
America’s Heartland. There is a
ecrmin harmony in their union.

In his artwork, Nebraska artist
Keith Jacobshagen demonstrates a
deep understanding of this union
and a respect for nature. Works by
lacobshagen, a professor of art at
the University of Nebraska at Linr
culn, will be displayed in the Print
Study Gallery beginning February
25 and continuing through March.
22.

A native mid-westerner,
lacohshagcn captures in his pmnlr
ings the wondrous beauty of the
Great Plains‘ landscape, including
massive thunderheads, brooding
winterclouds, and spectacular sun-
sets in endless horizons.

iacobshagcn speaks very rcvcr—
ently of the Midwest, “We live in
anextmordinaryplaecouthere, We
are very fortunate. I understood
early on that my muse was the light
and the space of this place where I
live."

Jacobshagen’s landscapes fall
into two groups: the small oils on
paper, which are painted directly
from the motif, and the larger slur
dio paintings, which are loosely
based on his plet'ri air studies.

Most of his small works are
painted within a fifty mile radius of
Lincoln, Nebraska, in areas such as
the Salt Valley, but some are the
result of occasional forays to the
Platte River region and thc Misr
souri Valley.

In IJiese smaller works, small
lines are painted over an earthy
stained ground. They are begun by
first ﬁxing the lines ofthe horizon.
Below that division, the fixed fea-
tures of these vast panoramas are
marked by features of the land—
scape: gridded fields, grassy pas-
tures, dirt roads, farm houses, grain
elevators and outbuildings.

Jacobshagen'sskicssetthemood
of his works and are painted first,
and then the landscape features are
fixed. Spaccis defined by ihcqualr
ity oflight,and time is speciﬁed by
the particulars of the atmosphere.

Jaeobshtigcn captures these ru-
diments precisely, without egotism
or ostentation. This is not tosimply
1 luck of expressive or emotional
content. Indeed, most enchanting
is his ability to fuse his perception
ofthc natural phenomenon wiLh his

state of mind and emotional re
sponse to the subject.

"Light is the sensualist of emo-
tion and meaning... itdefines all. I
tryto payattention to form, butit is
not the only reason for painting. .
,not to the same extent as the vast
field of sensation and experience.
It is the balance between the two -
form and emotion - that interests
me," explained Jacobshagen.

His studio paintings aredcrived
from his plain air studies and
drawings but are typically larger
and on canvas. These works may
also be assimilation: rather than
particular scenes. The details of
these works are more formally are
ranged, the result of a more con
templative, reﬂective distilling
process. As in the plain air land-
scapes,ihc subtleevocation of mood
prevails in the studio paintings.

According to John Arthur,
Jacobshagen‘s works "have long
remained one of the best kept so
crets in contemporary art, perhaps
becausotheyareabittoosubtlc,too
contemplative, and too lacking in
egotism for current taste. His doe

its light and weather, and the delie
cate cast of personal reﬂection
which culminate in extraordinary
of sense of place and mood. in
order to be fully appreciated, the
subtleties of these intertwined and
mold-layered facets must be con-
sider

Mr. lacobshagcn Will give a talk
and slide presentation on March 7
at 7 p.m, in the Fine Arts Auditor
rium. A reception will follow in
the Print Study Room.

“It's always a good time,“ said

Gospel Extravaganza this Saturday
night at 7 in Herrick chapel.

The program, hosted by
Grinnell's Young Gifted Black
Gospel Choir, includes perfor-
mances by the Pan African Gospel

It’s something everybody should
experience," she said.
