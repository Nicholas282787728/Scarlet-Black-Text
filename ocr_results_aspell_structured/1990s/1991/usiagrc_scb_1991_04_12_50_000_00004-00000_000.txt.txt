Freedom of speech poses dilemma

Administrators try to prevent discrimination without compromising liberty

By Kim Eckan

Since the late 1980's, colleges
nalionwidc have constructed and
reformed their policies on the dcfi-
nition of verbal harassment and
freedom of expression. This shift.
toward what many call the “politi~
cally correct," attempts to elimi-
nate racism. sexism, homophobia
and other prejudices from campus
language and conduct. On some
campuses, these prescribed codes
ofbehavior not only apply to legal
matters and rule violations but to
the cun‘iculum as well.

Faculty at the University of
Texas, for example, argue over a
remedial reading course focused
on white male racism. At Duke, an
English professor argues against
traditional texts and claims that the
local chapter of the National Asso-
ciation ofScholars is, among Other
things, “homophobic." And at
Smith College, the“Smith Design"
was created to establish ideological
fundamentals of the college; among
them, the banning of “lookism'li
lhedetennination ofanindividual‘s
value based upon his/her physical
attractiveness.

At Grinnell, however, the col-
lege grievance procedures defining
harassmenthavc notbeen seriously
challenged. Similar to the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin's U.W.S, l7,
Grinnell’s policy defines harass
ment as “any offensive verbal,
physical. or other form of conduct
directed at a student or students of
a particular race, religion. national
origin, handicap or sexual or
affectional preference.“

"the policy also notes that the
offensive behavior is considered
harassment if there is a proven in-

tent to crmlc”iin intimidating. hos
tile. or offensive environment"

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady emphasized Lhal violations
ofthecodcarcczircfullyconsidcred
on a cascrby-case basis, and the
policy is reviewed regularly. In-
fringementofthecodcisclcarwhcn
the disputed actions advocate ille
gal or unconstitutional behavior.
“However. you can'tbc so restric-
tive Lhat you infringe upon First
Amendment rights," he said.

Such a clause, then, arouses
questions of how intent is proven,

luin changes and any formulation
of standard ideologies in the class—
room, Duke said that balance in the
curriculum is most lmportant.
“Glinnell is a community which is
sensitive to these issues, and we
respect divcrsllyilllal gets rcr
flccted in the way we teach our
courses," he said.
“It'sllkccensorshlpofanysort,
How you legislate something like
that is difficult,” said Roberta
Atwell, professor of education.
“You take away sommne'sspccch,
and you affect cveryonc's speech."

 

”There is a need for the exchange of ideas,
and there is a needfor students to challenge
those ideas. We can put our heads in the sand
if we wish, but there are membErs of the Ku
Klux Klan out there, just as there are radical
blacks and skinheads. A speaker has the right
to speak, and the listeners have a right to

challenge. ”

and how free speech differs from
verbal harassment. According to
President George Drake, the goal
of liberal arts campus is to promote
diversity and the free, educational
exchange of dialogue. This ex-
change should not be limited. said
Drake, and individuals should not
be intimidated from challenging
ideas. “The focus lies in the style of
thepresentation of ideas, rather than
the ideas themselves," said Drakei

Dean of Faculty Charles Duke
echoed the belief in free exchange
in reference to academic freedom.
Although the faculty has the ulti—
mate decision regarding curricu-

Eric Wynn, director of Mullir
cultural Affairs. agreed on the im-
portance of ideological balance in
choosing guest speakers. “There is
a need for the exchange of ideas,
and there is a need for students to
challengcthosc Ideas," he said. “We
can put our heads in the sand ifwc
wish. but there are members of the
Ku Klux Klan out there. just as
there are radical blacks and
skinheads. A speaker has the right
to speak. and the listeners have a
right to challenge."

However. talk of restricting
speech to conform to a prescribed
ideological code requires a deeper

search into the institution's destred
and actual identities. Ira Straubcr.
professorofpoliticalsclence,notcd
that the question of banning free
speech depends upon the
instituLion’s sense ofidenLity—what
it expccls of its students. adminis-
trators and faculty. Equally imr
porlant are the different ideas each
individual may have concemtng
what is offensive, and how such
opinions relate to the institution‘s
ideas of what is offensive.

in evaluating an institution’s
identity,Straubcrsaid lltatoncmust
determine the current situation
among diverse peoples and the
institution's desired situation.
Moreover, the faculty ultimately
defines an institution‘s identity
through the curriculum and the
campus environment. “You have
to ask, is thereaconsistentpolttical
pattern in what is taught, in who ts
brought to campus to speak?"
Strauber said. “it is an individual
judgmentihowoppressivedo you
thinkthecurriculum,orthccampus
environment, is?”

Therefore, ideas of offensive
speech may vary from campus to
campus, and the tssueofwhclherto
address such a problem depends
upon the institution's “self-idem
tity." Perhaps Smith College, for
example, constructed the “Smith
Design" to combat vistble tensions
or simply to establish a fin-her
ideological stance. Grinnell’s
policies are slightly less explicit,
but this may allow for a broader
definition of diversity.

“If we're serious about regulat»
ing free speech.” said Strauber,
“then we must first deﬁne what we
mean by a diverse environment
which is conducive to lean-ling."

"Political
correctness" .

By Rina Khan

“Pollllcal correctness” is an iSr
sue that is currently generating a
great deal of controversy both on
campus and around the country.
The daily lives of students from
every kind of background are be
ing affected in one way or another
by Lhe challenge ofbeing a “politi-
cally Correct" person, The term
”PC" has become a catch-word
around campus. Butstudent’s atti-
tudes to PC vary widely.

Greg Adams, who is the chair-
man of the College Republicans.
descrihedbeing PCas“ludicrous—
being politically coneet IS an im-
possible Concept." However. he
fttnhcr added that his group was, if
anything, antirPC. in response to a
question concerning his view on
betngPC,Otto Pohl,anollteractive
member of the College Republi-
cans. replied that “I’m not.”

lason Gross, a Visiting student
from the University oflown,who is
also the vice-chaimlan of the Iowa
Federalion ofCoIlegc Republicans,
responded that his attitude towards
being PC was “being conserva-
Ltve.” He added, however, that
college studean tend to be more
open minded than older generations
and should pride themselves on it.
Mark Havlicek. a former student
body president ofthe University of
Iowa who was accompanying
Gross, felt that being PC was “a
new fascism."

Thad Johnson, a junior. de»
scribed what he felt were people's
attitudes to being PC on campus.
“Lois ofpeople who are PC are PC
justforlhe fun and fashion ofit," he
said. He added that he doubted the
sincerity ofsome people on campus.
Others are downright wary of PC.
“1 recognize it and stay away from
111" said senior Steve Hombacher.

Kate Leonard, a senior who has
been involved in helping the
homelessinDes Moines.qucstioncd
ifllledeﬁnition ofPC is “referring
loan image or topwple‘sactions’l".
Junior Mark Baumann felt that be-
ing PC was a “new form of televi»
sion. It’s trading onesheep menmlr
ity for another.”

DougHess,an active memberof
the Persian Gulf Alert and the Latin
American Support Group felt that
being PC was “just a label for dis-
regarding someone‘s views."
Rashmi Dyaerhand, a member of
the Politically Active Feminist Al~
lianee stated that “to be politically
correct is to impose a false and
limiting category upon oneself.”

HJ. Pyle, a member of GCEH.
was more positive on being PC. “I
think there is a ccnairl correctness
in being politically correct. If you
accept other people's beliefs with
outchallcngtngthcm yourscll‘,then
that ts dangerous,“ she said.
