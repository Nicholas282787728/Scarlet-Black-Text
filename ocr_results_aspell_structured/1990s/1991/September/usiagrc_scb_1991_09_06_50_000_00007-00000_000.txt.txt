munity is much broader than in-
creasing numbers of students or
faculty," said Dorothy Palmer. as-
sociate director of admission. “The
task force will exist as long as nec-
essary. Ideally, we’d like the plan
to be presented to the trustees at a
future meeting this year."

Man Stippich, student govern-
ment president, said that the role of
the students on the committee is to
integrate multiculturalism through

the campus atthe student levelAin
clases, through participation in
workshops, attendance at lectures.

not an end. It‘s a means to an end,"
he said.

The 20-person task force will
continue to meet throughout Sep-
tember but aims to integrate any
formulated plans during the year.
