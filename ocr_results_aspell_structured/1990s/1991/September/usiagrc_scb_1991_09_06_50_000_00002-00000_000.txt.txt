By Sharyn Obsatz

President Pamela Ferguson sees
Grinnell as a “vision of usefulness
in the modern worl ” Ferguson
spoke yesterday at Scholars’ Con-
vocation about Grinnell's value as
“an agent for rational change," ad-
dressing the importance of a libelal
arts education, what she sees as the
core values of Grinnell College,
and her priorities for Grinnell’s fu~
ttire.
Elected last winter, President
Ferguson begins her active term as
Grinnell’s 11th president this fall.
Previously she served as Associate
Provost and Dean of the Graduate
School at the University of Miami.
Her speech in Herrick Chapel, en-
titled “Values from the Past, Priori-
ties for the Future,” stressed the
close relationship sheseesbetween
the spheres 0f“academic" and “hu-

man" at a liberal arts college.

The liberal arts college environ»
ment “expands ourselves, our
minds, our talents," said Ferguson.
Disputing those who feel that a
liberal arts education doesn’t pre-
pare a graduate for a job, she says
that deﬁning a “job" by material
wealth is a narrow way of looking
at the world. If one converts the
definition of a job from “earning a
living toe means of living," argues
Ferguson, a liberal arts education
prepares an individual to “care for
the larger world around that job
environment and to deal with their
own inner environment."

President Ferguson listed “the
core values of a college like Grina
nell" striving to provide quality lib-
eral ans education “Teaching bo-
gins and ends with the student“.
the college must be Student—cen-
tered,” she said, adding that stu—

Ferguson.

She stressed the value of the

Outreach is another core value
of Grinnell, said Ferguson, citing
the college’s history of chuming
our graduates who make great con-
tributions to society. “It’s not an
isolated or insulated community,"
she said.

Concerning her priorities for
Grinnell's future,Ferguson said she
wants more effort focused on “fos-
tering an inter—ethnic. international.
inter-cultural community on cam-
pus."Whileeffonshavehemadeto

open all opportunities to all Amerir
cans, Grinnell do so as well. said
Ferguson,

Helping each individual stuv
dent retain his/her self-identity
against the impersonal forces of
technology is also one of her top
priorities.

Student speaks out on
events in the USSR

by Ann Treistman

When Sasha Shcharansky first
heard the news of the attempted
coup in theSoviet Union. he as»
sumed it was aser-up. ‘Things like
that don‘t happen spontaneously in
Russia," he said. “There is too light
a control.”

Shchar-insky should know. Be,
fore coming to the United States in
l987, he Wasa citizen ofthe Soviet
Union. His family left Moscow in
1986 for Israel, where they gained
citizenship. “We handed in our
passports and thatwasit."explained
Shcharansky, whoplans on becom-
ing a US. citizen in another few
years. ,

Unrest in his native country came
as no surprise to the political sci
ence major. Nor did it seem to
surprise President Bush, com-
mented Shcharansky: “At first I
was sure that it was something of a
set-up...not exactly an organized
coup, but,..it happened overnight,
and Bush had a strategy." He felt
lhzlt both President Gorbachev and
Boris Yeltsin could gain from the
fall of the Communist Party.
Gorbachev was quickly losing
popularity as he sided more arid
more often with hard-liners and his
future in the SovietUnion wasdimi
Shcharansky pointed to the failed
coup asaway for Gorbachev Iostep
downwithouthumillation. Yeltsin,
on lheoLher hand,evolved asahero;
the image of him jumping on a tank
and calling for civil disobedience
still lingers on.

It is assumed that the “union
treaty“ which was to be signed on
August 27 precipitated the attempt
to overthrow Gorbachev. The treaty
would have reducedpowerbetween
the central government and the 15
Sovietrepublics, Now the treaty is
certain tobepassedas the republics
need the central government for
economic and military ties, hut
Shcharansky emphasized that
Gorbachev would retain some fed-
eral power only if this happened.

“Without the treaty." he shook his
head. “Gorbachev is sure to be out,
Even if it does succeed. he still
might be out."

Shcharansky is worried that
Yeltsin will gain too much control.
“Yeltsin will spark nationalism .”
he explained. “He will make the
people forget about food. They will
vote for Yeltsin because he is not
Gorbachev.”1n 1991.Yeltsin be-
came the first popularly elected
president of Russia after a check-
ered career under Gorbachevi He
was appointed theCommunistParty
leader of Moscow and a candidate
member of the Politburo by
Gorbachev in 1958,and was thrown
out otppth positions in 1987 when
he argued that refortns were mov-
ing too slowly.

“Yeltsin is not going to get Ruse
sia too far.“ saidShcharansky. “He
is rude. inconsrderate, and careless.
He has no political program. The
people wanted immediate change
when Gorbachev came in. They
wanted material gain. Theeconomy
has been in a slow decline since
1917. Gorbachev brought the
economy down rapidly (with re-
forms) in hopes that it will rise,..l
trust Gorbachev. He is honest. He
could've continued the hardrline
politics when he gained power,hut
he started reforms. Yeltsin was
only elected because Gorbachev
brought in free elections.“

Yeltsin resigned from the Com
munist Party in 1990.afterwinnga
seatinthe new Congress ofPenple’s
Deputies in the ftrstdemocratic elecr
tions. Shcharansky expressed dis-
guslat this: “Gorbachev would not
have done this. He would have felt
itunethical to leavethe party which
had brought him to power.”

Although Shcharansky is con-
cerned about Yeltsin‘s popularity.
he is "happy thatpeople are ripe for
getting rid of the system." “I feel
good that they destroyed the statue
of Feliks Dzenhinsky (the founder
of the Secret Police).“ he smiled
“Lenin’s tomb is next."
