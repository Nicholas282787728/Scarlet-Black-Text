Predictable love story
:seen in White Palace

t By Jennifer Stukas

) Ifyou‘rein themood fora thought-
Aprovoking, fomiula-shatiering, gen-

erally“deep"movie thisFriday night,
Vdon‘t bother trekking to Han-is to see
elast year’s release While Palace.
)You’ll just have to trek back a half-
hour later. But if you’re in the mood
Tor a simple, old-fashioned romance,
’Complcte with a happy ending and
wot too many plot twists, this film
will leave you smiling; even if it's
>only from laughing at its cheesiness.
' This ﬁlm stars James Spader as
:Max: 21 starched, buttoned-down
’yuppie, incapable of setting himself
free from his strictly organized life,
‘pretentious friends, and thoroughly
controlled emotions. Through an ex-
,tremcly coincidental twist of fate he
meets Nora (S usan Sarandon), awan-
)tonrseeming older woman,first while
'she’s working in a fast-food restau-
grant (where they argue), and later in a
rsqualidbar (where they exchange sad
stories and eventually head off to
Abed). AfterMax realizes the warmth

and intelligence hidden beneath
Nora’s tacky exterior, and Nora
comes to see Max’s subdued sexi-

ness, the two fall in love. But prob- .

lems of course arise when Max is
unable to fit Nora into his preten-
tious, upper-class world. and Nora is
unwilling to conform.

Rescuing the labored plot is the
acting of James Spader and Susan
Sarandon. Both have played pans
like thesebefore, and seemingly were
made for them. Not as wonderful is
the supporting cast, whose represen-
tations often make potentially amuse
ing characters seem like caricatures.

Yet despite my generally nega-
tive review of While Palace, 1 can
honestly say] enjoyed it. Thecharac~
lets, though stereotyped, were like»
able: theplot, though formulaic,kept
my interest. This is not a movie
you‘ll spend much time discussing
with your friends. However, for a
before-[herparly good time, it‘s defi-
nitely worth seeing. While Palace
will be shown on Friday at 7:30, and
on Sunday at 3:00 in Harris Cinema.

EBergman's touch pervades
artsy Wild Strawberries

it

By Brett Fechheimer

( The 1957 Swedish film Wild
Strawberries (Smutlron-Stallel), di-
>rected by the legendary Ingmar
.Bergman, creates for the viewer a
‘cinematic journey which often bor-
ders on the surreal.
‘ In Strawberries, an elderly doctor
>(Vict0r Sjostrom) travels to another
,Swedish city in order to be honored
by a university. Along the way, he
‘has a series of dreams and fantastical
avisionsi including ﬂashbacks to
‘earlier periods of his long life.
These visions and ﬂashbacks help
‘the professor, who is traveling with
his straightforward daughter-in-iaw

(Ingrid Thulin), to reﬂect upon his
life and to better understand some of
his actions and motivations.

Strawberries can often be confus-
ing and frustrating because of its clue
sive subtleties. However, movie
buffs will find this film intriguing
becauseliepitomizcsaparlicularcim
ematic genre— namely, the postwar,
pie-[Am Curious (Yellow) European
art ﬁlm. Moreover, Wild Strawber-
ries is generally considered to be one
of Bergman’s greatest directorial
achievements.

Presentedin Swedish with English
subtitles, Wild Strawberries will be
shown on Saturday at 8:30 in North
Lounge.

iRoll: Rush does it again

By Alex Lyda

_ Few rock bands have ever been
abletosuccessfuliyadaptstyllstically
’10 changes tn musical tcchnology.
»Wlth the advent of the synthesizer in
the70’s,manybands revampedtheir
sound,butconsequently lostthemagtc
’that had made them great.
This has not been the case for the
,Canadian trio Rush, as they so deftly
illustrate in their iastest studio pro-
duction Roll the Bones. For a band
ethat has been recording Slnce 1972,
,Rush has become noticeably more
reliant on synthesizers, but they can
‘etlll hammeroutguilarril'ls that rival
contemporary electric guitarists like

Satrlani and Johnson. A very im»
pressive song on this album is “The
Big Wheel," in which Alex Lifeson,
the band’s guitarist, demonstrates
his trademark rhythm-staggered hy-
lcad technique.

For three middle-aged rockers
who have been around for nearly
two decades, this is a damn good
opus. A return to the intellectual
qualities exhibited in their lyrics in
previous albums would greatly sate
lsfy the ever-growing cult of Rush
fans. Nevertheless, their latest in-
stallinent of music has certainly ad
vanced them one step closer to be-
coming one of the most consistent
bands in rockr’nﬁroll history.

Alice: Psychedelia, Grinnell-style

By Jennifer Stukas

A friend of mine, who refused to
attend Grinncll because he assumed
its entire population was composed
of “throwbacks from the 60‘s," made
the mistake last year of visiting meon
the day of Grinnell’s annual Alice in
Wonderland party.

Walking into Gardner Lounge, he
was shocked by the accuracy of his
prediction. He immediately collided
with a dreadlocked young man in an
Indian-print skirt, dancing wildly to
a live band whose musical style
sounded suspiciously like that of the
Grateful Dead. in the comer of the
lounge,seveml dazed-looking people
hung freshly created tie- dye T-shirts
on a clothesline. Others satin acircle
on the ﬂoor, decorating each other's
faces and hair with vibrantwatercolr
ors and sparkled spray “paint."

The whole affair was, to him,

very “scary“ but, tothestudents who
attended, this psychedelic party was,
in general, a pretty good time.

Last year‘s Alice in Wonderland
party, however, had one drawback.
Due to rain, it had to be held in-
doors— a definite distraction to the
party’s mood. This year’s party is
one again planned for the sunny out-
doors (on “the Quad" in front of
Cleveland) but, if the weather doesn’t
cooperate, it will be held in the
Harris Center.

Alice will occur this Saturday af-
ternoon, from 12:00 noon until ap-
proximately S:00 and, because of the
two bands which are invited, there
will never be a moment without mu»
sic.

Those of us familiar with last
year's campus/town band Shut-Fine
Jelly will recognize Popa Mezz band
members Chris Sutliffe, Todd Threet
and George Paine. Also playing will
