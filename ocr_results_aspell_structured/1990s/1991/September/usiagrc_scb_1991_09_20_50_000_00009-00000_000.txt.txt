A So let’s say some of y‘all got this
'girlfriend. The rest of y’all got this

boyfriend. Say this person has 2t gui-
' tar. No, that’d be too cool. So let’s
,say y’all, all y’all, got this band

comin‘ to campus instead. Hell, you
rgot TWO bands comin‘. Your pare
. ents don’tknow ‘boutany ofthis, but
‘ they find out, They would like to

know what is up. But you can't tell
r ‘em because they are too old, they do
, not understand.

All they can think about is those
‘ three Halloweens running you went
. as Gene Simmons. 30 it’s not like you

can just say, “It’ll be different this
‘ time, Ma. This one doesn't suck like
a the last one." Like, how do you ex-
Aplain somethin’ like that?

This all makes no sense to y’all
'now, but it will all come together
.. when you go see Urge Overkill with

3 Car Garage, 10:00 this Saturday

You should wear shoes. Don't bring

A Urge Overkill's latest album, Sue
perrortic Storybook, was touted by
Spin as “the best album of 1991 " To

ingsomeofthemostfanny—whippin',
footrstompin'.serge-wearin‘,medal-
lion-sportin‘, pile-drivin‘ music ever
to pound beets to bo borsch. They
have been compared to Grinnell al—
ums Sonic Youth, Macalaster axe—
geniuses J Mascis and Colin Bucks,
hometownfavesTheWho,andDesert
Storm vet Neil Diamond.

And, hey, it‘s not just the music
that warrants widespread media at»
tention and weeping. Rather, it is the
total entenainment package. the sty-
listic vision and the swank. Just the
swank, Nothing but the swank. And
the other two things, too.

The last time we saw Urge Over»
kill, we didn’t get in on the guest list.
They had four changes of costume.
They wore gold velour ‘n’ black
spandex bodysuits, blue cmshed vel-
vet suitcoats, white monogrammed
turtlenecks, big honkin’ silver me—
dallions,andimmaculatewhitepatent
leather shoes. Oh, and clear plastic
guitars like the guy on Read 2nd.
There were big 01’ TV monitors on
stage, too. The bouncers gave away
free water.

 

As statedin theirpress kit, “Look-
ing good is part of sounding good."
AccordingtoMTVdarlingNateKato,
"We’re always at least semi-formal,
very much down on lheeveryman-im
a-tashirt aspectol rock ‘n‘ roll. If you
want to see people in t-shirts, ride the
bus So y all know these guys are
lookin’ good bookin’suave. Lookin',
well, swank. So youlcnowtheyMUST
be soundin‘ good. Soundin‘ you
guessed it, swank as y'all get out.
They’re kinda loud, kinda whim
cal, kinda like that new love you just
can‘t explain to your parents. But

mey don’t suck. Well, we re not too
sure ‘bout your parents.

And it‘s not like opening band 3
Car Garage is all that big on t-shirts
either. Heck, last time we saw them
they were shruggin’ mose babies off
before they could sweat thru ‘em.
More than just rock 'n' roll hors
d'ouevres, Garage serves up a sonic
mac ‘n‘ cheese dinner sure to satisf
“Join mydietplani," challenged their
singer. And as you’ve probably
guessed by now, they areas loud. but
not quite ascute as your girlfriend. Or
your boyfriend,
