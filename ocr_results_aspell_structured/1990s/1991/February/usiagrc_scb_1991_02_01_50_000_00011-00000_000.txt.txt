Cagers split weekend contests

By Spike Patterson

TlieGrlnnell Pioneer men's has-
kclball split dleir two ganles this
weekend. losing to St. Norbert Fri-
day night, and then coming back to
crush Lawrence on Saturday. St.
Norbert proved too strong down the
stretch, and beat the Pioneers los-
98. Freshman sensation Mike Riley
was the key for the Green Knights
who led by only two points at the
half. Riley led all scorers With 35
points, and played inspired basket
ball at both ends of the floor.
Junior center Chris Jacobson led the
Pioneers with 23 points, while
Dave Musstttt and Craig Studer each
added 19. The Pioneers’ failure,
though, came at the charity stripe.
Grinnell sholjust 60% from the free
throw llnel'or the gume,andonly 3 of
12in the first half.

Despite several key defensive
playsinthe second half, the Pioneers
could notseem to puttogetherarun.
Riley and the Knights kept fighting
back, and eventually went ahead to
stay. Coach David Arsenault was
pleased with his team’s effort sayr
ing, “the ethic was Lliere both days.
We just gave St. Norbert too many

second chances. and you can‘t do
that against the good tennis.”

The Pioneers had better luck
Saturday against Appleton,
Wisconsin’s own Lawrence Vi-
kings. A second half surge by
Grinnell left the Vikings wonder-
ittg wltai hit them. The score was
tied at 60760 early tn the second
haitwhcn Pioneer juniorguttrdAliin
Thomas took over. Thomas scored
the next xix points. driving to the
hoop wtih authority, and Grinnell
never looked back.

The final score was 115-88, and
onecan only imagine how long the
bus ride back to Appleton must
have felt. Thomas finished the
gamewithl}points,“atrctnend0us
job” according to Arsenault.
Jacobsen added 23 points and 10
blocked shoLs. He also had an
impressive 32 rebounds for the
weekend. Mussatt led all Grinnell
scorers against Lawrence with 25.

Saturday at 3:00, the Coe
Kohawks march in to Darby Gym
for what Arsenaultprotnises will
be “a dogfight.“ He hopes that the
Pioneers will use their superior
quickness to wear down the bigger,

stronger Coe team.

The Koliawks bring with them
a strong front line which includes
Cedarkapidsnzitive Mark Kleppc,
one of the best reboutlders in Dlvu
Slon lIl basketball. Arsenault is
impressed with Coe‘s talent, hut is
confldent in his team's chances.
“You can throw out all the point
spreads when it comes to this n-
valry",Arsenaultsays. Onceagtiin,

Scoring restrictions
damage Mad Duck at
Loras Invitational

By Dave Ressner

The Grinnell women’s swim-
ming learn suffered its ﬁrst defeat
of the new semester last Saturday.
They narrowly lost to Luther Col-
lege by 12 points at theLorasiuther
Invitational.

If you have been following the
continuing saga of Mad Duck,
however, you will remember that
just the week before at the Grinnell
Invitational the women trounced
Luther by 113 points! 50, why the
drastic turnaround’.l Coach Sheila
Cain cited scoring restrictions that
only allowed two swimmers per
school to count in each event.

This meant that Grinnell could
not draw upon its good depth, but
instead had to count only on high
finishes to scoreits points. Consid-
eringthislimiiation,Cain said,“We
did quite well.“

In yet another display of fresh
men talent, Grinnell was led by
Julie Cross who was victorious in
the 500 freestyle and Liz Fields
who won the 100 backstroke. Also
in the name of Mad Duck, Amy
Oggel placed second in the 200 and
500 freestylesand DanaDanley did
the same in the 100 butterfly.

Sheila Tom and Shannon
Swanstrom went 2} in the 50
freestyle as did Holly Kellar and
Lisa Swift in one-meter diving.
Also, each of Grinnell's three re-
lays took second place.

Tonight, the team travels to
Nonheast Missouri State for what
will probably be a tough meet
against the Bulldogs. The team is
really looking forward to next

weekend, however, when it will
compete in theSmall CollegeStzttc
Meet where it will Lry to settle the
score with Luther. Mad Duck has
won the State meet each oftttclasi

 

Ressner leads pack of dogs to victory

By Steve Clem

The Grinnell Men's Swimming

team won handily at last Saturday's
Invitational in:
Dubuque. The pack of Mad Dogs'

Luther/Loras

outdisianced secondrplace ﬁnishers
Luther 313—253, Other Iowa teams
competing included Coe, Comcll,
and Loras. The Mad Dogs achieved
this easy victory despite a scoring
method which was intended to “wa-
ter-down”thedepdiofiheMad Dogs.

Coach Ray Obermiller
explained,”We were only allowed to
score the top two swimmers. We
would have won by more than 70
points had more places been allowed
into the scoring."

In orderto make up for ihe“rigged“
scoring method, the Mad Dogs
needed some great races from the
team leaders, which they got.

Junior Dave Ressner won the

Invitational's Outstanding Swim-
mer Award, as he won the 200
I,M.(2:Dl.90).t.he100Fly,a.ndwzis
a member of the victorious 200
Medley and warm relays.
Ressner‘s time in the 100 Fly.
:52.80, was just off theNationals'
qualitying time. “Ressner had a
greatmeet, I’m pretty sure that 200
I.M. was the fastest he has ever
had,” said Obermiller.

Junior Joe Zimsen had a great
meet as well. Zimsen was on two
winning relays, and took second
place in the 200 IM (2:02.00) and
the 100 Back(:59.7). Sophomore
Doug Murphy was a member of
three first-place relays: the 200
Medley, the 200 Free, and the 400
Free.

, Obermiller was very satisfied
with the meet, but stressed that
there isstill plenty ofimprovemenl
tobe made. " I wantto have much

more sprinting in practice, and bet-
tersiartandtum techniques. In the
next three weeks, weill be finding
our niches for Conference, so we‘ll
do a little bitof experimenting“,
said Obermiller, adding, “We’re
looking to me to be right on track."

The Mad Dogs will go into '40
lion tonightin Kirksville, Missouri,
where they have a dual with North
east Missouri State (NEMO).
