New study-abroad option proves attractive

When in 1960 Marcus
Mcrriman wanted to take a year
abroad from Bowdoin College to
study in Britain, he had to cut
through more than his share of red
tape. Bowdoin. likemost othercol-
logos and universities in the United
S tates at that time. had never before
allowed students to study abroad
for credit.

Merriman’s success in getting
such credit resulted ultimately in
hitn emigrating to Britain. After
completing his BA at Bowdoin he
returned to go to graduate
school

In 1968, shonly after being ap-
pointed a history lecturer at
Lancaster University, he was in-
strumental in persuading the ad
ministration of the then fledgling
university (founded in 1964) to take
its first study abroad students.

Now, 23 years later, Iancaster,
ﬁrmly established as one of the top
British universities, has become lite
latest overseas destination for
Grinnellstudents,Takingadvantage
ofLancaster's ﬂexible curriculum,
students are able both to integrate
with therestof thestudentbocly and
take courses required for their ma

jor at Grinnell.

"It saverystickopemtion, ’said
Mcrriman, the former director or
Lancaster's North American of-
fine, who gives his very theaLrical
and humorous introduction to
Lancaster to arriving American
students at the beginning of each
term.

“The nature of the Lancaster
system is that we integrate the kids
into existing British courses," he
said. “They're treated as nearly as

possible as ordinary British undcrr
graduates."

Nigel Rogers, the current direc-
tor ol‘ the North American Office
and aSeniorLecturerin chemistry,
reiterated the theme of integration
of study-abroad students into the
Lancaster program. He described it
as “the whole essence” of
Lancaster's setup for visiting stu-
dents.

He also cited the success of

colleges with which it is compa-
rable. Among over 100 insututiens
or higher education represented at
Lancaster over the past two de-
cades are Williams, Oberlin,
Harvard,Brown and theUnivcrsity
of Chicago.

As for the five Grinnell students
who have attended Lancaster over
the past two semesters, he said that
they have taken mainly science
courses. They have, however, taken
courses in several different fields.

”For the most part. they basir
Cally do whattheywoutd havedone
at home,” said Rogers, referring to
the liberal ans curriculum atGrin-
nell. He added that they have also
taken advantage ofLancaster‘s size
(around 5500 students and450 face
ulty) to take courses they would not
have been able to uke at Grinnell.

Rogers alsostatcd that Lancaster
would welcome Grinnell students
to stay fora full year rather than one
semester, This, he said, is the most
popular of their options for
American students. However he
recognized that it was at variance
with Gnnnell‘s usual procedures
for off campus study.

Ethel Sussman, Lancaster's New
York based North American Offi-
ccr, added that. an extensive alumni
network in theUnitedStates assisted
students in finding out more about
the university.

Sussrnan said also thattoe Hart,
a Grinnell junior who attended
Lancaster last fall, would be repre-
senting the university at a study
abroad fairat lowa State University
during the last week in February.
She said that Lancaster much we
fcrrcd to be represented at such
fairs by students rather than by fac-
ulty or administration.

“We find that it is a very good
thingto do," said Sussman.“1tis an
opportunity to talk to someone who
has actually been through the expe-
ricnce.”

Common Garden Street, a shopping street in Lancasrer, is
one of many heavily used by pedestrians. Traffic is kept
out of, or limited on, most downtown streets.

Campus Studies, was pleased with

the progratn as a major opportunity
for students who might not olhcp
wise have gone on an off-campus
program.

“A lot of students perceive that
they need to stay on track here," he
said. ”It makes it a little easier if
they can take [required] courses in
their major while they’re away.”

The program has indeed found
favor with students. Senior Noelle
Welch, who spent the second se-
mester of her junior year at
Lancaster, found it an enjoyable
experience both academically and
socially. She particularly liked the
university‘ 5 style of teaching, which
is more oriented towards indepen-
dent study than Grinnell, even
within given courses.

“I liked that. I really found that
different,“ said Welch. “I found it
challenging. It was really a feeling
of accomplishment if1 did well,
whereas here (at Grinnell) it‘s kind
of a feeling of desparation if you
don’t do well."

She also enjoyed Lancaster’s
social life, with over 100 clubs and
societies,andeightpubsoncampus.
as well as a good residence hall
system. She felt that being on a
floor with a large number of ﬁrst-
yearstudentshelpedheradjustmore
easily.

“The people on my ﬂoor were
really nice," said Welch, adding
that they broke through the stereo-
types of the English being with-
drawn and reserved. “They really
made an effort to includeus in what
they were doing."
