Professor Cervene
exhibits Retrospective
in Burling Print Room

By Michael Kavanagh

The exhibit Richard Cervene:
Retrospective is on display now
until September 28 in the Drawing
and Print Study Room in Burling
Library. On display are the colorful
paintings and watercolors by
Grinnell’s own Richard Cervene, a
Grinnell College graduale and pro-
fessor of an, The works in the ex
hibit span the years 1962 - 1990.

Cervene received his M.F.A.
from theUniversity oflowain 1953
and later studied with the well-
known Minimalist painter Josef
Albert: at the Yale-Norfolk School
of Art, Since then, he has been
awarded many prestigious distinc»
lions, most recently the Grinnell
Alumni Award.

Onexhibit in the library are sev-
ernllarge-scaleoilpaintings.which
are mostly abstract color-field imn
ages, as well as some watercolors
which aremore expressionisticand
recognizable irl nature. Grand Case
(197l) is an example of the former.
composed of repeated horizontal
lines of bright colors. Cervene
strives for the appearance ofetfort-
lessness in his work.

He has certainly achieved his
goal in Grand Case: the lines of
bold colors seem to ease their way
across the canvas, making the lm»
age appearto "drift“. Cervene’s free
quent emphasis on color in his art
was inﬂuenced in part by his men
tor Albets, who is known world»
wide for his own brightlycolored
paintings. ButAlbers is also known
asaMininialist.whileCervene per-
ceives himself as more ofa “color-
lield" painter, Minimalist an, ac-
cording to Cervene. differs from
hisownbecauseitcontains no “rev-
elation of the artist's hand, no ﬂex-
ibility or individual handling."

His work Backyard (1990) is a
good example of the more expres»
sionistic watercolors includm‘l in
the exhibiLFlowers and grasses are
easily recognizable in the painting,
but they still retain the careful use
of bright color which characterizes
so many Cervene paintings and
which makes them so pleasing to
the eye.

Everyone is invited to attend a
reception this aflemoon at 4:15 in
theDrawing andPrintStudy Room.
where all can view the exhibit and
meet the artist

House of Games plots and schemes

By Brendan Riordan

in a ﬁrst attempt at ﬁlm direclr
ing, Chicago playwright David
Mamet came up with House of
Games, an intriguing psychologi-
cal thriller riddled with plot twists
and con artists‘ schemes, The story
begins as famed psychiatrist and
author Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay
Crouse). in an attempt to help a
patient whose life has been threat-
ened, is drawn into the dangerous
and provocative underworld of con
man Joe Mantegna. Allured by his
darkly exotic life, Dr, Ford begins

to realize that she herself is a pawn
in one of his brilliant con games.

This 1987 movie is indeed ex-
pertly crafted. However. in Watch-
ing the film itbccomes obvious that
this is a transition film for someone
moving from the medium of theatre
into ﬁlm. The sets themselves are
well crafted and designed,butnota
whole lot is attempted in terms of
cinematography. and obviously one
should not enter the theatre expect-
ing any kind of special effects.

Thedialogue may seem attimes
a bit dry and a little reminiscent of ‘
the stage, but the characterization
and plot development are excep-
tional. and both Mantegna and
Crousecan alwaysbecounled on to
put on fine performances in any
Mamet production.
