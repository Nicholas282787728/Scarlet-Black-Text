with the graduation of DJs Allan

tradition is drawing to a close.
During its long run, the show
has developed something of a cult
following on campus. The show
was popular almost from its intro-
duction in 1986 by DJ Dickie
Wallace. But when Kale NOSBIlt

Since last summer, he and Faas
have anchored it as it draws to a
close.

No one can have any way of
knowing if it is the most popular
KDIC show, but if one is to judge
by the number of requests it ranks
with the best. They came in thick
and fast over the telephone last Fri-
day. But Joseph was a little disap—
pointed with the aftemoon‘s tally.

“I’ve done Whole shows where

standard, this broadcastwas clearly
a little slow. “We‘ve only had
about 21 out of about 34 or 35
songs,” he noted after about two
hours on the air. “Usually it’s a lot
better,” lmentioned that mostKDlC
DJs would bedelighted lohave that
many requests, and he nodded, but
that was all.

Joseph puts the deluge of re»
quests down to lhepopularity of the
'70’s music of which the show is
entirely composed. “I think al
though [students] may not listen to
it on a regular basis. a lot of people
really enjoy the ‘70‘s music. . . It‘s
so much fun!" he said And some
listeners go to the point of collect-
ing their own original music. “I
know at least 20 people who‘ve
bought their own records and have
large Collections of original '70’s
music," he added.

Other reasons are cited by Jo-
seph for the show's success. its
format, for one. “It’s a great show
because unlike most of the other
shows wedon;t stick to any particu-
lar genre — we juSt play anything
we want,” he remarked.

Childhood is not the only sign

supported. “Did you see how many

like the plague, a fact

which Faas admiu.

added. “I guess you wouldn’t. say

The future ofthe {ormaton KDIC
remains uncertain. The title Songs
from your Childhood will cease.
But Neav'ins (“an avid listener 7
she listens religiously every I-‘rie
day," said Joseph) wants to con-
tinue the format with Some call it
Childhood, a title which would re-
ﬂect that relatively few current
Grinnell students were born early
enough to remember the music.

Faas felt it could lose its appeal
as a trip down memory lane fairly
quickly. “It would deﬁnitely start
falling into that category of ‘70's
music. It wouldn't be such a ﬂash-
back or memory lane type thing as
the ‘80's show would be," She said.
Which, says Joseph, is why “we
decided this would be the end of
Song: From Your Childhood”

Joseph predicted. though, thatit
would continue to attract a large
followingductothe varietyot‘70's
music. "The show has a lot of
promise and will always have a lot
of promise because it was a time
thata lot of exploration and experi-
mentation was done," he said He
also thought that ‘70‘s music would
become a curiosity, rather like that
of decades past, “What the ‘60‘s
music was to us, I think the 70':
will be to the next few classes,” he
Claimed.

Neavins, for one, has no doubts
at all. She even plans to do her
show at the same time »- from 3 til
6 on Friday afternoons. “It has
been my dream, if you want to call
itthat, for quite some time to adopt
the show. I'd hate to see itjustdie.
It‘s too much fun - too much of
what Grinnell means to me. I love
listening to it while playing sandpit
volleyball or when dancing on the
loggia or when going into town.
It's a great way of winding down
after a long week, It is the start of
the weekend,“ she said.

“I guess this all sounds pretty
Crazyandfanatjcalvmaybeitismm
Childhood just gives me a special
feeling of fun and relaxation," she
added. "There are a lot of good
memories there. There are a lot of
comy and sappy songs, too, and
that‘s what makes that period of
music unique.“

There‘s life in the old show yet.
