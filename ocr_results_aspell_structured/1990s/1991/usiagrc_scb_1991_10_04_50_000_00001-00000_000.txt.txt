In Britain, it would have startcd on
time. The first debate of thc scmcstcr
got underway about ten minutes late
witha filled Herrick Chapel IastTucsr
day night. 'I'thrinttcll chating Club
sponsored the motion ”The Ameri—
can Dream is a nightmare.” For the
afﬁrmative team, Kim Preston and
Helen Berry. two Britons. and Amy
Downs, a senior at Grinnell, argued
against Lev Kaye. Marian Sakscna,
and David Karol.

The two British women were cho-
sen to represent Britain on a six week
touroftwenty-thrccschools.Through
an application process which culmi-
nated in spontaneous debates by nine
finalists, Preston and Barry were
elected to travel throughouttheUnitcd

The opcning statements were met
with laughtcrand howls and thcnudir

Barry supported herargument first.
Shcdcpictcd her vision of the Amcrie

depicting an immigrant landing in
America. He sees the Statue of Lib-

night. According to Grinncll Policc
Chicf Dan Boyer, additional reports
came in on Monday night while two
officers were patrolling the c us.
”The night watchman was i ally
callod,andtwo officers on footpatrol
joined in the chase. Sgt. Hansen tacks
lcd twoofthcjuvcniles.and Corporal
Peterson caught one more."

Boyer said that the group of at-
tackers was believed to consist of six
to chcn people, who were all 16 to 17
years of age. “We have chargcx‘l three
pooplc at this point, and wcarlticipatc
charging thrccmorc.” Boycrbclicvcs
that the attacks were all targctcd at
Grinncll students. “Frankly, it was
just some kids out looking for some

sport.Grinnell’scloseproximitymadc
us the most likely candidate. Occa-
sionally we get some weirdos who
come in to make some trouble. We‘re
going to make sure that we take swift
action against them."

Oda Callison. assistant dean of
student affairs. stressed that thc stu-
dents should be alcrt, observe safety
and call either the night watchman,
Student Affairs, or the police in the
event of an emergency. “We expect
this to be a safe place. butitis part of
the real world and things like this
happen," said Callison.

SGA President Matt Stippich said
that the incidents may help stimulate
further discussion of an escort scr-
vicc. “'I'hcissue of an escort service is

always brought up in an event like
this, but it usually dies down a few
wccks later,” said Stippich. “We are
going lobe looking into some kind of
escort service that is more flexibleﬁ
one that is not so ambitious. but more
effective."

Boyer pointed out that the police

adding that the intention is not to

raining a foot patrol designed for pro-
tecnon. We are not going to be there
to spy on the students," he said. “I
want the students to know that we are
concerned with their safety, and if
they call up here they are going to get
a prompt response."

Kaye spoke next for the opposi-
tion. He asked the audience to rce

Kaye, America is striving to improve

self-improvement. insisting that
Americans must not give up on the
dream and givcinto cynicism. “True
equality has never and will never ex—

“Having a dream forces us to exam-
ine ourselves. The dream is not real-
ity."

Downs opened her thoughu with
the names of three men who embeds
ied the American dream. “Lee
Iococca, chry Kissinger, and
Michael Dukakis." she listcd, noting
that “to be fair, we should look at
Clair I-qutablc from the Cosby
Show— a rich black female lawyer
living on the safe Streets ochw York
City.“ Downs blasted the television
outlet which portrays America as a
melting pot.

“The American dream is to mi»
noritics what Frcddy Krucgcr is to

children,“ Downs said. as members
of the audience screamed.

Sakscna shift/ed the focus to Brit-
airt in her presentation. By depicting
a society without a dream, Sakscna
explained. the audience might better
understand how imponantadream is.

The summary for the opposition
