SPEECH: Student considers limits of MAGILL: Columnist
college harassment policy

Anyone who docsnotbclievcin
the slippery slope argument (that a
resth'ction on some speech leads to
areslricLionon mostspeoch)should
study the changes of the harass
ment policy to see its effects.
However, I should note there is a
silver lining in this cloud of doom.
The administration, to my knowl~
edge, has yet to enforce the policy
to its fullest extent. This gives us a
chance to change it before the cen-

sorship begins.

I (as are most people here) am
aware that harassment is a terrible
problem that has to be dealt with.
out I disagree with the way it’s
being dealt with. Please take a mo-
merit to think about the lmleCar
Lions of the present harassment
policy,andifyou see fit, stop by the
Student Affairs officeand tell Lhem
you want it changed. Tell them you
want no restrictions on speech (in

They could cost you a career.

Last year alone, America‘s

businesses lost more than $50
billion to drugs. So this year,

Failing the test means you won‘t

contemplates Peace Day

continued from page 7

Grinnellians would rise to the chal-
lenge. As I look over II‘ic schedule
for tomorrow's events I realize that
ii is a vain hope. Where are the
speakers who believe that the war
was necessary topreservepeace? Is
their view important enough to
hear? The people who planned this
conference clearly do not think so.
They have shied away from the
imponant and difficult questions
and taken Lhc paved road inslead.
So much for moral courage.
Courage, however, is what is
called for. Tomorrow. April 20,
would be Adolf Hitler's 102 birthr
day. This man who so epitomizes

the questions of War and juSLiCC,
whose name was so often bandied
about dunng this war. is forgotten.
lior one can think of no day more
appropriatetorajsethesequesuons.
Clearly oLhers either do not Lhink
the questions are worth raising in
earnest or frightened of the reality
they might have to confront if they
did. Oh well, no one really likes
discussing painful issues anyway.
Chamberlain ignored them until it
could be ignore no more, and the
world was cast into the abyss of
World War 11. With conferences as
hollow as this one, which ignores
the real issues, I can only wonder
how far the next abyss is away.

MORAN: Computer list
raises free speech issue

send me daily hate mail, but Mr.
Martin is not in the real world. We
live within the boundaries of an
academic democracy, and in order
for any democracy to succeed. cerr
Lain individual freedoms need to be
given up in order to benefit the
society as a whole. We all made lhe

choice to be here and abide by those
rules. AtGrinnell,as deﬁned by the
Student Handbook, freedom of
speech is limited.

But Gee Whiz, guys, what do I
know? I’m just a loser, Nobody
loves me but my mother, and she
could be jivin' too, to quote the
immortal B.B.King. I don‘t even
have a sense of humor.
