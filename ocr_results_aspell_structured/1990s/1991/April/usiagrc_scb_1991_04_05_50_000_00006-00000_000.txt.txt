We got the blues in Harris

By David Shearer

“Buddy Guy is by far and Willie
out a doubt the best guitar player
alive." -Eric Clapton, Musician
Magazine (Nov. 1986)

OK, so let’s pretend that Eric
Clapton really IS God. It easily
follows that Buddy Guy should then
be God’s favorite guitar player.
Hmmmm,.,that was too easy. Ace
tmlly, the only real question here is
why God’s favorite guitar player
would want to do a Harris Center
gig. But there really is no answer,
as is the case with all the classic
theological questions.

Buddy hails from the holy city
ofChicago, whereheownsanight-
club and jams with other litLl§
known musicians such as the Rally
ing StonesJimmy Page,andStevie

Ray Vaughan. Buddy says he even
taught Hendrix a thing or two.

Mr. Guy is the definitive“inno
vative guitarist.” He has won the
admiration and inﬂuenced every
one who has tried to play blues on a
guitar from BB. King to Clapton,
Keith Richards, Jeff Beck, Jimmy
Page, and I think he might have
even bumped into Poison‘s own
C.C. DcVille at a Long John Sil-
vers in Tuseon.

Buddy’s stage presence has won
him acclaim worldwide. Ithas been
often said that his albums do not do
his live showsjustice. So, in other
words, don’t take Clapton‘s word
for it (after all, what does HE know
about the guitar), go see blues the
way blues should be seen tonightat
10:00 in Harris. And don’t. forget
your holy water.

a great landmark achievement for
the group,” said Stuhr-Rommerelm.

Wild at Heart
tellsi‘i’Shocking,
twisted story of

misﬁt lovers

By Jason Gardner

Faithful to director David
Lynch's shockingly quirky style,
Wild at Heart follows misfit lovers
Sailor and Lula (Nicolas Cage and
Laura Dem) as they race across the
South in their black Thunderbird,
ﬂeeing the law and other more
dangerous forces.

Some argue that this ﬁlm falls
shortofLynch’searliereifort,Blue
Velvet (1986), in its expression of
his stylistic trademark - thebrilliant
but disturbing mixture of corny
American optimism and the most
grotesque violence. Here the
director's vision becomes faster and
more spectacular as Lynch bathes
the screen in blood and bright col-
ors, creating a twisted but utterly
unique tale of America's seamy
underbelly.

Wild at Heart Will be shown at
7:30 tonightand 3p.ml onSunday
in the Harris Cinema. Come pre-
parcxitobcshockedandentertained.
