Directing class faces challenges of the theater

By Tara Neavins

In less than a week, eight one-
act plays directed by students tak-
ing directing seminar will be pre-
sented in Flanagan Arena Theatre.
Perlomtances begin at 8:00 PM.
on May 2, 3, 4, and 5.

One-Acts are the traditional
spring ﬁnal project for both theater
and nonrtheater majors alike, The
directorsthis year include Blakcsley
ClappJulieannthre, Tom Klouda,
Lia Kohles, Heather May, Brandan
McClain, Joel Shepherd. and S.
Michael Smith. rnedirectors range
from sophomores to seniors.

In addition, the eight plays are
diverse, but as director Erandan
McClain explained, they mainly fall
into the categories of “comedy and
weird."

”The seminar brings togetherall
that we do in the department," said
Professor Sandy Moffett “1! is the
culmination of the coursework mat
students take in the department.“
During the ﬁrstparlofTheatre 370:
Directing, students work with
Moffett and Ian Czechowsld, as-
sociate professor of theater and
Dean of ctr-Campus Studies, stu
dents learn the basics, like medium
andvisuzl. Onlyafteraboutamontn
is any aural aspect introduced. At
this point, the sound is in the {01111
of gibberish and is used to develop
range and ability. Non'nal verbal
dialogue is one of the lastelements
to studied.

“A lotofwhat we think is impor»
tam is the use of the whole me-
dium," stressed Moffett. He went
on to explain that those inexperi-
enced in theater tend to focus too

much on the language itself and
neglect other theatrical aspects.

“A lot of things are being said
that are not actually in the lane
guage," he continued. “One thing
unique to small liberal ans schools
like Grinnell is that undergraduates
are allowed and encouraged to di-
roct plays such as OnerActs, Open
Space productions, and indepenr
dent endeavors. In addition, stu-
dents of theater are cross-trained so
that they have a grasp ofall aspects
of theater trom set to tech to acting.

“A lot of schools do not want
undergraduates directing ..tltey're
inexpelienced." Moftclt also come
mented. “I have never had anexpe-
rience where an inexperienced ac-
tor was harmed by dealing with an
inexperienced director."

“his hard becausealmostevery-
one in my play is a friend of mine.
but they understand that they do
what I saymit is a professional
workspace. I found the same thing
when I worked in my dance class,”
said May, a junior.

Moffett explained various other
beneﬁts of students directing at the
undergraduate level. “One of the
greatest dangers for an actor is to
rely too much on the director. Ac~
tors often say, ‘l'll do what you
want me to do’." he stated.

By working with directors who
are their peers, Moi'fett believes
that actors are able to develop their
character based on their own expe
rience and that it was “both the
responsibility and the right of the
actor to do so." He feels that inexe
periencedactorsand directors could
learn from each other and “a lot of
times actors are more assertive and

come up with their own ideas."

“Iwantmostot‘theslufftocomc
from them (the actors).“ said
McClain, a sophomore.

“They need to take their charac-
ter and make it their own,” stated
Klouda, “l havean idcuothow (my
play) should bentit lends itselt to
oncinterpretation. I’m trylnglogcl
around that...it’saproccssoftrying
to get to know each other."

May selected an absurdistpiecc.
“I wanted to try something entirely
different, not along the lines of
anything I've done. I wanted to
challenge myselfand try out a new
brand of theater," she stated.

Almostallofulcdirectors agreed
that having an excited cast and be-
ing able to motivate them was es-
sential, May said, “I [am] supposed
to be in charge..but they are indi-
vidual actors. it is particularly my
responsibility tomake sure thatthey
have a reason to be excited and up.
These are real people that you are
dealing with.“

”the actors are really into the
play and really excited aboutit.,the
cast is almost more into doing the
play than I am,” McClain noted.
Klouda was more cautious, "You
hope that thereason theactorscame
outis because they arecommitted.“

“I have the greatest cast in the
world,” said Kohles. “I have been
walking around all day grinning."
But she noted that they were "not

Teaming their lines very quickly."

One thing thntmostofthe direc-
tors huve discovered is that you can
never be completely prepared to
drrcct a play. l<louda commented,
“You don'tleam directing by read-
ing about it.” MCCiﬂln added that
“Ihings are dirrercnt for each play
you direct You learn by directing
many playsandseeingalotollhem.
No matter what preparation you
hltvc...there’s that‘lhmwn-lntothe
fire’ feeling."

A major problem with the One-
Acts ls the shortage of both rcr
hearsal space and time. One reason
ls that “A little Night Music” is
practicing concurrently and thus
using theatre space as well as some
of the One-Act cast members. In
addition, there are eight student
directors. which limits resources.
May said that “a little more time
would be nice but when you've got
eight directors using the same
spac ’5 hard."

“You want the same space
everytimeatit gets people used to
beinginthatspaceand makesitthat
much easier each time to focus on
the play.” McClain noted.

Klouda added that the directors
attempted to practice in the same
room daily and to “try to be sensi-
tive to [the] actors or it’s not fair to
them .but there‘s never enough
time.

As a group, the directors agreed

to keep rehearsals down toaboutan
hour a day so that all could have
space in which towork. Wlthin this
time, “ofprlmary importance is the
wtum»up” which lasts about 10-15
minutes, explained May. “You
dcﬁnltciy dcvclop a rhythm and
have to beon lhesarne level. Iiyou
do notestabltsh the mood. ..every.
thing is not going to go alright."

Following the warmrup, there
“is Just barely enough time tor the
play ittclr’, commented McClain.
As a result, many of the directors
have focused on just half of their
one-act at each rehearsal and have
then done the second half the next
day. This leaves Just a short period
for notes and for working on indie
vidual scenes.

“lt’a always been a very excit-
ing process..a lot of energy and
enthusiasm. There‘s a feeling
among the people involved that it is
their own work and that they were
not Just used by someone else,"
Moffett said. He emphasized that
the 0ne»Acts were of interest to
students since one “does not al-
wayswanttoseeafull-lengdtplay.“

Moffelt compared One-Acts
with his recent experimental piece,
MacNuggets, which he described
as "selections from MacBeIh ap-
proached in adifferent way." Both
offer awide variety of interestsand
different mediums to utilize. “I
enjoy seeing that." he noted.
