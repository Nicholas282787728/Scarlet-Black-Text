slum where a growing underclass,
freed by welfare from the new to
hold a job, terrorized people with
little interference by a “revolving
door” criminal justice system. The
liberals at our school, who lived in
elegant apartments in Soho and on
the Upper West Side, were entirely
removed from this; they never had to
experience the effects of the policies
they championed.

After two years J ose left the school,
for academic reasons or because he
was hopelessly maladjusted. I saw
him again when, during my senior

5 year, he relumed for a visit. He told

3 me he was going to a public school

somewhere near the Brooklyn- _
Queens border. An awful place, from
his account. The “students" carried‘
hidden guns around in the halls. Dur- ,
ing his first week he had almost been
beaten up for not being black.

Tsongas closed the conference by
identifying what he believes to be the ‘
major problem for the Democrats in -
1992. “The democratic party must
