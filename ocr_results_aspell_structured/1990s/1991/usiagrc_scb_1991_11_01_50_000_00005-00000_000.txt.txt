degenerated to mush that can only
comprehend issues in very basic Stile
urdaymomingcartoonplots.Thebad
guys versus the good guys. Saddam
Hussein was a very different villain
than I-Iill, but Thomas made a very
good victim-cum-hero. The woman
whining about sexual harassment?
Obviously in the bad guy category.
Especially against Thomas.

When I first heard that the vote on
Thomas was delayed, some of my
faithin thecountry was restored. Per-
haps things weren’tsobad. Congress
realized (albeit quite late) that a Su-
preine Court nomination was pretty
serious. As one of nine justices who
would be making some major deci-
sions, maybe theappointmentdidre-
quire a little checking into.

The hearings were broadcast on
television and I had ttte opponunity
to watchjustice in action. Hill, a pro-
fessor at the University of Oklahoma
Law School,repeated again andagain
that she understood the implications

surface

of her accusation. Some senators
couldn’t fathom why she didn’t quit
herJob. A 28 year-old black woman
surely coutd’ve found other work in
the same ﬁeld. Then there was the
issue of time. She waited ten years.
And she’d phoned her formerboss to
congratulate him on his marriage.
Now, a woman who had had to listen
to a man describe pornographic mov—
ies in detail wouldn’t have done that.

Hill has said that she is not sorry.
More employers may now be con-
scious of what constitutes sexual ha-
rassment. I hope that this awareness
really will touch the majority of the
country. I have my doubts.

Much like a child laughing at the
Road Runner's coyote as dynamite
blows up in his face, much of the
country cannot fathom the true dam-
age of Hill‘s allegation. Unlike the
coyote, she will not be unscarred in
the next scene.

Make those scars worthwhile.
Think about the hearings, think about
the Supreme Court, think about how
weappear to othernations. Don’tpart
your fingers in a "V" unless you truly
comprehend what it is you’ve won.

 

:THE REAL WORLD

:The pressure of being funny

s People just don’t appreciate how

I tough it is to be funny,

I went out last week before

‘ midsems to try to cope with a little

‘ stress, and as soon as I settled down
with my beer, a handful of drunk

‘ people came up, uninvited, and

s plopped themselves down at my table

“You re Laura Moran, aren t
you?" one said, conversationally

4 Guardedly, I nodded, wondering

‘ which ofthem wasgoing toannounce
that I owed him five bucks.

' “I heard you’re really funny," an-

. other member of the party piped up.

‘ “You write Lhosearlicles for theSand
B, don’t you?"

- “Yeah,” I said, feeling my nerves

‘ getting tense. With a bright, vacuous
smile, the girl across from me deliv-

‘ cred the unrepliable linc.

‘ “Hey--say something funny!”

That’s got to be up there on

‘ Letterman’s Top Ten Ridiculously

s Unreasonable Demands You Can
Make On People in Public list, right
behind the one where you walk up to

'a graduate student in philosophy

‘ who’sjustfinished his thesis and say,
"Hey, philosophy, huh? Wow. Say

‘ something smart.“

e “I don’ tlmow, "Isaid, waving my
hand dismissively as I tried to avert
disaster. “I’m having a rough day.

‘ I‘m really not in the mood. "

. “Oh, come on,“ the kid closest to
me said, grinning expectantly.

“Look," I said, starting to feel a

ylittle trapped, “I think Ijust failed a

” Christian Trads exam, I have a recital
tomorrow, and my English profjust
gave me back apaper that he said was
too lousy to even grade. I don’t feel
all that funny."

Laura
Moran

”That’sgreatl" oneofthem yelled,
Slapping his hand on the table.

Istood nervously. trying to plotan
escape route.

“Comcon,gang. Ipulled amuscle
playing racquetball this morning, I
think I’m coming down with a sinus
infection, and my mouth is practi-
cally livid with chancre sores. Can't
you all leave me alone?" I pleaded.

Laughter mngoutcnthusiastically.
Iheard, “What's she drinking? Some-
body ought to buy her a drinkl" and
magically, a beer appeared in frontof
me. Isatback down. Maybc,I thought
to myself, this situation has possibili»
ties.

The crowd was waiting, expectant
smiles draped across their beer-
ﬂushed faces.

”Mylifesucks!”Iexclaimed,start—
ing to catch the mood. “It‘s all devas-
tation, pain, and despair!” I drained
my beer with a long swig, and there
was scattered applause.

"Practically Burkowski! " someone
cheered.

“Everybody’s life sucks! We’ll all
be dead before we're 30, and we’ll
still be living with our parents! I‘ve
got THE FEAR! Beer! I need more
beer! No, make itvodka! I need shots
of vodka! Make it bottles,dammit!"

By the time I made it home, I was
staggering. It was a good night, but
the next morning was hell.

Ijustdon'tknow aboutthis humor
thing. The pace is killing me.

All things in

moderation

--even politics

I have made a scary realization in
the past few weeks.

I think I am becoming a moderate.

Iknow whatsomeofyouare think-
ing. Alanna,you undeniable dyke you.
just by living your life the way you
want to, no one will ever consider you
a moderate.

And you haveapoint. Don‘twotry,
I’m not planning on going out and
marrying a man or anything rash like
that. However, I have found that sev-
eral of my reactions to recent events
have caused me to reconsider my
general definition of myself as radi-
cal.

One of these occurrences that
surprised me also surprised, I would
guess, at least a few other liberals on
campus. First, I would like to apolor
gize for this point. as I have repeat-
edly sworn thatI would never honor
The Spectator clan with aresponse in
this space. However, this is an impor»
tant revelation,

Aboutamonth ago, [picked upthe
S cartel andBtac/c and The Spectator
to read over lunch Friday, as I often
do. I read The Spectator first, and, as
usual, was fuming by the timeI got to
the last page. Then I read Mr. Kent‘s
comic strip in the middle of the page.
To refresh yourovercrowded memo-
ries, it was about those notices from
Student Affairs, and it highlighted
theiramusing vagueness. ’I‘hemiddle
panel said that if anyone spotted a
suspicious white mate, the concerned
party should contact Student Affairs,
and “we‘ll send] en Krohn out to kick
their butt." I read this, and I laughed.
Ididn‘tjustlauth guffawedipaused
for a moment, ashamed that I found
entertainment in the words of a man
who sometimes seems torepresentall
that’s evil in the world to me. Then I
decided thatit’sokay to beamusedby
someof his words,even if enraged by
other words on the very same page. I
was reminded of how I had listened
patiently to the Republican speaker
Leroy Corey, even after he compared
me to Adolf Hitler for my pro-choice
views, because I was seriously inter-
ested in understanding his point of
view. Whatelsecould I do? Laughing
made me feel better, so I laughed

again.

The next event that concerned me
was my reaction to the “chalking" of
campus during the week that culmi-
nated in National Coming Out Day
on Friday. I really don’t mind chalk~
ing as a concept, since, asB S: G seem
panicularly eager to prove when it
comes to gay-oriented messages,
chalk washes off fairly easily. But I
found myself startled, even mildly
upset, to walk past several graphic
depictions of vulvae on South Carn-
pus.

Now,Idon'thaveanything against
vulvae. Really. Bull don'tcareto see
drawings of them, even accurate and
artistic ones, on the way to class.

Alanna
Walen

During a discussion with a friend, I
pointed out that I would be highly
annoyed and perhaps even offended
if someone drew giant penises all
over campus. She said that it wasn’t
the same thingithat that would be
like fortning a National Association
fortheAdvartcementofWhitePeople
in reaction to the NAACP. I saw her
poittt, and I agreed that penises and
vulvae were socially on differentlev-
els of acceptance but decided that I
still didn't care to see the pictures on
the sidewalk. Yet they made me think.
and perhaps that was the point any-
way, rather than aesthetic apprecia-
lion.

What do all these reactions mean?
Have I become a wishy-washy
middle~of—Lhe-road-walker7 Or have
Ijust learned to compromise? I will
nowlistento“theotherpointofview"
than might have haughtily refused to
considerjust afew years ago. I think
carefully about individual situations
and produce a judgment based on
facts, analysis and experience instead
of making an instant moral decision.
Rather titan turning me into a classic
“knee»jerk liberal," Grinnell has given
me the ability to recognize the need
for, and the skills to practically
achieve, compromise.
