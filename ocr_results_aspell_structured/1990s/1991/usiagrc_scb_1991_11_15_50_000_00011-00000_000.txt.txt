Men’s hoops slow pace to gain victories

By Terra Geiger

The men's basketball team has a
new look for the upcoming season
that will shock avid followers of the
Pioneers. Lastyear's fast paced, hell-
bent shooting barrage has been re-
placed by a slow-down, snail‘s pace,
few possession style.

Coach Dave Arsanault said, “The
team was given the choice. I felt we
had to choose one of the extremes,
either fast or slow. Due to our physi-
cal abilities, it would be difficult to
play straight up.“

Arsenault said he personallywould
have preferred to keep up the quick
pacewhichis entertaining andallows
the team to utilize more players. But
he understands why the players chose
to slow the game downiit may put
the team in a position to win more
games.

“Playing fewerpcople in a slower.
limited possession game will prob
ably result in more upsets. but it will
also allow weaker teams to sL’ty with
us longer. What fans will miss out on
in the quick up and down shooting
barrage, we hope to make up for by a
lot of close games," he said.

Although the team has lost a few
players to graduation, the majority of
its players who saw a lot of playing
time last year are returning They will
be led at the center position by senior
co-captain and three-time all-confer
ence selection. Chris lacobsen.

I acobsen, who according toArsenaulL
“with a little help and good fortune“
has a good chance of becoming
Grinnell's all»time leading scorer.

Sophmore'l'odd Youngwill direct
the offense from the point guard posiv
tion. Arsenault said Young is sea-
soned beyond his years.

"Although we have suongstarters
at center and point guard. we are still
searching for back-ups. We will need
to avoid fouls at these positions,”
Arsenalt said.

Arsenault said mere are a number
of players vying for the other three
positions on the court. Senior co-
captain Alan Thomas will provide
good leadership and is expected to
seealotof playing time. Sophomore
Jason Franc] solidiﬁed his strength
in the weight room over the summer,
and due to his excellent athletic abil-
ity may lead the team in minutes
played this year.

Other sophomores who are ex-
pected to contribute are Craig Snider.
one of the best three point shooters in
the conference. and Chad Folsom who
has shown marked improvment since
last year.

The learn is also looking for help
from two first-year students from
South Dakota. Steve Diekmann, a
two»time all-stater. and Todd
McGuire, a versatile athlete who was
also an all-stater.

Aisojoining the team for the ﬁrst
year is Assisant Coach Andy

Hamilton, who Arsenaultclaims will
be a definite asset. According to
Arsenault, Ham iliton is “clearly hav-
ing a positive inﬂuence on us. His
positive attitude and knowledge have
made a big difference early on,”

Coaches have picked Monmouth
and Coe to go one-two in the confer-
ence this year. Arsenault said that in
general the conference should be
stronger titan last year.

In spite of this, he said, “1 project
we’ll be better than last year, and I
don‘t expect us to fall off. This is the
first time I’ve been here where I re-
ally consider it a ‘team.’ Before. it
was just a group of individuals.
There‘sa lot of chemistry thisyear—
on and off the court. This will be
especially imponant if we get into a
lot of close games like I predict”

Coach Arsenault’s only concem
isthatin asystem where fewer people
play, some of the players may react
negatively to seeinglittle meaningful
playing time.

The team will informally open its
season tomorrow at 2 pm in Darby
against a team of basketball alumni
coached by John Pﬁtsch. Arsenault
said, “Tomethe social aspectismore
important than the development.
However, the kids don‘t necessarily
see it that way, as there are a number
of one-on-one rivalries that have de-
veloped. There will be a core group
of returnees who will take the game
very seriously."
