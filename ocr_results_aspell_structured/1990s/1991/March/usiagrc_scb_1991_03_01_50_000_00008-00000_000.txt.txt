TENTS: Advertisments
absent from tables

reau and moreover to the student
body.

McConnell said that the an-
nouncementof abolishmentof table
tents was put in the Memo at the
beginning of the semester. I
checked. There was no general
announcementin any of the Memos.
As for the brigbtyellow table tents
which appeared the ﬁrst two weeks
of school, Dave McConnell ex-
plained that those table tents were
there because of the 1D policy, a
very specificDining Servicesissue
which they were trying to enforce.
Therefore, it appeared to me that
table tents were still acceptable and
were still being used.

But McConnell further exv
ptained what a big waste of paper
table tents are. He also said that
table tents arc not really read and
that they end up on the floor and
make the dining halls look messy.

After my meeting with Dave
McConnell .I asked many students
on campus their feeling about table
tents.Tliere was an overwhelming
response in support for table tents.
Most. people feel that it is one of(if
not the) the most effective ways of
communicating events on this
campus. That is why we need table
tents. They are needed to commu-
nicaieevenisorspcciaisymposiums
on important educational, cultural,
or ethnic weeks or months. Table
tentsarcaconstanicommunication
or “plug" for an important event

that might have been overlooked or
forgottenl am very angered by this
deesion. This week I had to plaster
the campus with advertisements
“plugging” Jewish Cultural Week
because I felt like I had to over-
compensate for the loss of table
tents. endofihe It is notthailtnink
every event should be advertised
by table tents, but those such as
culturaVeihnic orcducational weeks
are of special priority.

Drive McConnell and the Din-
ing Services did NOT consult the
students AT ALL about their deciv
sion to do away with table tents.
Dave McConnell told me that it
was a “departmental deciSion“ and
that no students were involved. It
upsets me that this could happen on
a campus where students needs are
usually so well taken into Considr
eration and where students Supr
posediy have so much of a say
aboutwhatgoeson withihesetiool‘s
different policies. Whether Dining
Semcesreallyconsidersuibletents
a waste of paper or whether they
just feel they are not “aesthetically
pleasing," it is still a disgrace that
no students were consulted while
the decision was being made.

The lack of communication on
Dining Services’part.as wellas the
lack of student consideiation fruS~
u-ates me. I like table tents. I want
them backand willdoevcrything in
my power to get them back.

SGA: President emphasizes safety
issue, searches for solutions

largeredmarkin mystomach where
the man had punched me. I then
realized what I had done, and I felt
terrible. So I called the police. told
them what happened, and asked
them to make sure the man wasn‘t
still lying on the ground. I called
back twenty minutes later, and they
said that nobody was there any
more. They then asked me to file a
report. but] told them I would wait
until morning. Here wasjusianother
day in the life ofa Grinnell student.

“What's the point of this'l“, you
may be asking yourself, “and what
in iamation does it have to do with
SGA?" Simple: as of that point, I
wasscaredto walkinto townltwas
no longer a safe place for me to be.
I also felt totally helpless. I filed a
police report. I reported the incident
to the Office of Student Affairs.
But so what; I was still scared to
walk into town. The person was
never caught and, even if he had
been, a very clear point had been
made.

Asmostofyouknow,aGrinnell
College student was recently at-
tacked about 50 yards from his off-
catnpus house. The person was an
internationalstudentwiihdarkskin.
His white male friend who was
accompanying him was left alone.
Again. a clear message had been
sent 1 know how scared he must
feel. Many international students
have also been afraid to walk into
town lately because of this inci»
dent. Nobody can blame them. I
have spoken with the International
Student Organization about their
concerns. Now I would like some
input from other students as well.
Should we establish a student-run
escort system? If so, shall it be
volunteer-run onpaid? What will
be the gender composition of this
service (random. all female, all
male, or teams of two with one
male and one female)? At what
times should it operate? What else
should can be done. . self-defense
classes? Would you like to see an
open forum addressing this issue (if
so,paneloropcn discussion)? What

else cart be done right now? More
longrtertn solutions such as ad-
dressing this issue in the new town/
gown committee are appropriate,
but not enough. Besides, the very
smallminorityoftownspcople who
committhese assaults are not likely
to participate in any discussion on
the matter. Should Grinnell (1 hate
to suggest) begin considering hiring
professional security? Should we
ask for more Grinnell Police pa-
Hols?

Whether you agree with any of
these suggestions or not. the prob
lem needs to be addressed. It sur»
faces every year. It is time we de-
cide, as a Campus, what that course
ofaction willbc.I-Iavingagroupon

me comments through the VAX by

wish, tell your senator and haveher
or him relay the message to me.

language houses; the final decision
on this matter will be the responst-
bility ofthepresidentofthecollege.

Secondly, Tom Crady, Ian
Berkowiterross and Dennis Perri
proposed the establishment of two
todireepennanentlanguagehouses.
A lengthy discussion followed, af4
ter which the issue was tabled until
the committee's February IA meetr
ing. On February 14. the Commit
tee decided to postpone a final de

cision ontheissue until moreinfor-
mation (especially student interest
andsupport)could be gathered. This
decision is reﬂected in the Housing
Information Packet distributed the
week of February 18 (seepage 10).
No recommendation regarding the
designation ofpermnnentlanguage
houses has been made by the Hells
ing Committee.

In order to avoid further confur
sion, we ask that, if you have any
comments regarding the CSlabllSl‘lr
menlof permanent language houses.
