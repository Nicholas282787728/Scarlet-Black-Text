' Now granted, I am a bit more
liberal than these organizations in
thatl will openly protest, but I know
that they would support my ideas.
We all long for a day when people
everywhere are free from oppres-
sion and war, and several of us are
willing to say so We are not the
flag—bumers of Berkeley or the vets

clan-haters of San Francisco; we
nreprotesters calling {or peace, not
an end tothe draft, twill admit that
I am not in favor of such a “Com-
munist” institution as the draft
within what is supposed to be a
democracy. Iwould hate to seeit
be re-instated, but that is not my
main reason for putting down
militarily offensive actions. We
teach our children not to ﬁght in
order to solve problems. and we
condemn the youth gangs for
ﬁghting over turf and drugs, but we
continue to ﬁght ourselves, some»
times for less convincing reasons.
This contradiction is what I want to
stop before we destroy our world

and all of the beauty it holds.

Besides, what did we do with all
of our bombs and tanks'.7 We freed
a terrorized nation from 2 mon-
strous dictator so tltat their own
monarch could hire hit men to kill
the members of the new Kuwaiti
democratic party. I was amazed.
We gave them back their human
rights and stopped all of the Iraqi
atrocities, but did that really free
them? I'd sure hate to see any
democratic supponers gain control
of that poor, weakened kingdom!
That would be worse than Com-
munists, right, Mike?

ROSE: Conservative
inﬂuence on racism

continued from page 6

—*
Although the civilrights movement
attempted to decrease discrimina-
tion, racism is still ingrained in
American culture. The recent trend
of conservatism in this country
clearly illustrates that real change
in race relations is a long way offt
Since traditional American society
has failed to give blacks equal op-
portunities, black separatism and
independence may be a sad reality
in the future.

' Hitler did not make history,
history madehimt The only reason
why Hitler was able to spread fits»

cism in Germany was because of
the political, economic. and social
unrest. Even though the United
States is more stable than the
Weimar Republic, injustice in this
country triggers the rise of dema~
gogues such as Farrakhan. Cort»
servatives and liberals alike can
attack the harsh rhetoric of
Farrakhan, but everyone must reat-
ize that the views of the Nation of
Islam as expressed by Farrakhan
are a reaction to the inequity in
American society.

In believing she has the right to

Molly Yard demonstrates the Imn

sion, she does not know these cul-
