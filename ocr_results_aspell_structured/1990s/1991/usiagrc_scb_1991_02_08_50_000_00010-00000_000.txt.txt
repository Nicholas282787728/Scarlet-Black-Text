to do in Grinnell during the len-
week period,0rangeexplainedthat
the research for which she opted to
take for four credits (which had to
be paid for) kept her busy although
she admitted that “at times things
were slow”. Although it was up to
her how much she would work each
week,heragenda was firstappmved
by Professor Mohan attheir weekly
meetings.

Orange eventually wants to go
tograduateschool to study Russian
and/or communications, possibly
working brieﬂy in the meantime
for an airline. This would, she
hopes, allow her to visit both the
Soviet Union and Africa. She de-
scribed the ACMScholars Program
as ”a valuable experience".

“It helped me during the school
year since I learned bett how to
pace myself, to get things done on
time. and to set my own deadlines.

mends the program. She also her
liech that it really developed sevr

Students Celebrate Peace at Gazebo

By Christopher Doemel

In perhaps the least publicized.
but certainly the most rhythmic
demonstration against the war. 21
Grinnell students gathered Sunday
afternoon in the town park for a
“Gazebo For Peace.“

The concept, first dreamt of by
Andrew Walterand Tom Zlabinger,
was an alternative nonviolent af-
ternoon. Zlabinger said, “You can
only scream at the top ofyourlungs
for so long. There has to be a better
way to get out one‘s fmsu-atinn.
We found out that the Gazebo was
our release.”

Members of the Persian Gulf
Alert (PGA). the Grinnell Draft

Counseling Organization (GDCO)
and many others attended this event
for peace. People brought instru-
ments ranging from bongos to
spoons and punched out rhythms
on the Gazebo itself. Before the
event, Walteradvised thosewithout
instruments to bring trays. "You'd
be amazed what a funky sound a
Quad tray will make," he added.
People danced to the music

they made. Some played frisbee
andothersplayedontheparkswitlg
set. The atmosphere was one ofjoy.
goofiness, and just good vibes.

"Itwasexhilirating."saidTara
Neavins. "It was jusr the sort of
carefree thing we all need once in a
while . genuine run."

The afternoon served its pur
pose. “Gazebo for Peace“provided
an escape from the frustration
caused by the war and provided an
atmosphere where people could re-
lease their energy in a peaceful and
positive way.

Ida E. Wells, or Stokcly
Carmichael? These are all people
who like King, Tubman, and
Douglass fought for freedom and

the list goes on. These people and
the many others are the reason
African American History month
is so very important to all of us as
Americans and not just to African
Americans. Think for a moment
who you would be if Dr. King and
Malcolm X had not enlightened
yourparents‘ generation aboutequal
rights. Would you bejust as racist
as European Americans of the
1960’s and before? European

Americans and some African
Americans are ignorant about
African American heritage. We
need the month of February set
aside as sacred for education: for
leaming not just the dates and
names,butalsorespect,sensitivity,
and compassion for the history of
our fellow Americans.

I am astonished that
anyone could accuse CBS ofbeing
childish in their actions. After a
history wrought with hatred, grief,
andoppression,Atrican Americans
have the right and the need to honor

the opportunity to celebrate was
diminished does not give anyone
much cause to celebrate.

Thus, said Vita], there is a grave
risk of surprise attack.

Vitalalsopointedoutthat Iraq is
still in a state of war with Israel,
since it never signed a treaty with
Israel after the 1948 war, In view of
the tiny dimensions of Israel, the
occupied territories are of tremen-
