150 years of Grinndfﬁistory

November 28, 1923: The S&B reports that Grinnell ranks 5th in
journalistic efficiency. according to the Sigma Delta Chi national
contest. The fraternity held its conference in Minneapolis, MN where
thirty national colleges and universities sent delegates. Grinnell ranked
5th for the second consecutive year, establishing it as a leader among
schools which actively promoted journalism.

December 4, 1940: The 5&8 reports that in the national Student
opinion surveys, United states college students believe that it is more
important to stay out of war than to help Britain (if help included the
possibility of war.) Fifty—five percent of students surveyed said it was
important to stay out of war at all costs. Forty<five percent said the
United States should make helping England, even at the risk ofgetting
into war. a major objective. The opinions ofcollege students contradict/
ed those ofolder adults who expressed theiropinion in a Gallup pole that
Britains are theﬁtst line ofdefense and [lint helping Britainshould be the
most important objective ofthe United States.

December 2, 1966: An SSLB editorial entitled “Trouble Ahead"
predicts negative repercussions following the actions of 19 students who
deliberately broke the college's Vi5itation rule the previous week. The
journalist writes that the action ivill apparently bring about a clarifica«
tion of the college's policies relating to Violations ofvisitation rules and
premarital sex among students. President Leggett tells an 5&B siaffthat
“on the matter of illegal Visitations which extend over night, I just don't
have an open mind on this.” Leggett apparently changes his mind
regarding the college’s loco parentis policy, haying observed only one
year earlier that the time ofloco paretis has passed Leggett warns that
the time may have come for the college include a formal statement on
premarital sex in the college catalogue. The S&B fears that the
administration is about to take a major step backwards

December 1, 1989: The sob reports that students reject an anti.
drug initiative proposed by the chairperson of the campus republicans.
While 287 people voted against initiative, an unexpected 2 ii supported
the referendum. The initiative stipulated that students “believe that
illegal use ofcontrolled substances" is “harmful to the health, safety and
economic well—being of the people of the United States." While the
initiative was meant more to gauge the opinions ofthe student populous,
students rallied against the idea that a referendum could summarize and
represent a complex personal decision in one yes or no question. The
S&B observes that students were not surprised that the initiative failed,
but that it received 42% ofthe 498 votes.

Grinnell's Jeanne BurkleWom-
en's Center moved its location last
week to a handicappet‘lraccesﬂble
building With parking available, 717
4th Avenue, formerly the Chamber
ofCoinmerce building. The move is
significant not only in making the
Centetmotc accessible butfotsignh

DVA has a Z4rltour emergen.

snult. DVA also offers Iongrterm
assistance for victims of sexual as»
not and domestic Violence, includ.
ing oneron—onc counseling and a
court advocate to lead them through
the legal process (such as pressing
chargesandfilingtesttalnlngottlets).

The Center is now called the
Jeanne Burkle Women's Resource
Center, and it Will eventually be
staffed during business hours as a
resource centerforlocalwomen.says
Tamra Hatﬁeld, Staff Director of
DVA. The public willbe able tostop
in and read over the Center's educa—
tional materials, and the staff can
refer interested women to programs
offered by DVA, the Center. or oth«
er groups. The old Center was only
open a fewtimes a month, during the
educational programming that it
held. The Center can now offer its
space to any community women’s
groups that want to hold meetings.

It will take some time for the
new Center to get its various func-
tions up-andtrunning, says Leigh
Brown, the member of the Center’s
committee who reports to the DVA
Board. The Center’s primary goal at
the moment is to secure the funding
required to start up its plans for pro—

gramming. The fact that the new
building is handicapped—accessible is
helpful for making this Center eligi.
ble for government grants. The Cen—
ter Will need more money now than
in the past because of the plans to
keep the Center open during the day,
to expand programming, to pay the
higher rent and hopefully, to buy the
building eventually. "Therefore. most
ofihe effortsofthe Center'scomrnlt»

that they hope to secure donations
from private corporations and iridi—
vrduals, an idea that the Center had
not petsued before. currenily, the
Center depends in large part on the
United Way for funds.

process to speed up, It was decided to
find another location in Griniiell as
opposed to moving all operations to
the DVA office in Marshalltown.
because a large number of Grinnell
College students are DVA volunteers,
and havrng a location close to the
college allows more to volunteer.
Hatfield also emphasizes the impoft
tance of “bridging” between the col»

a lot to shore both ways."
