Junior Maggie McKee’s bike was
stolen “in broad daylight” on No»
vember 20th, as she was inside the
campus mailrooin. She hadn’t locked
it up, having assumed rhnt the bike
was cheap enough that no one else
would want it. “1

McKee had

to install brakes and remove a fender.

she glued on a picture or Richard

McKee had gone through two
prior experiences of bicycle therr,
she says, but never one quite this
emotionally involving. “With this
third bike, I spent little money on it,
but I put so much of my heart and
soul into it, and then it was devastat—
ing" to have it stolen, she says.

But she got a message the next

The Tease after all, but a nciv moun»

the theft. McKee

badly The Tease rode until I got on
this bicycle!“

She still doesn’t know how the
anonymous benefactor found out
about her bike being stolen. She
emphasizes that she hopes they see
her gratitude in this or other articles
about her experience, “I hope that
the person who did it sees the

good about humanity....lt's so be—

bike came with a U<lock, to avoid a
fourth theft. “l‘m not taking any
chances with this one!" McKee says.

Grinnell College's Weekly NchPaPtr, cst.1894 - Grinnell College . Grinnell, Iowa
VOLUME 112, NUMBER 11 ‘ FRIDAY, DECEMBER rs'r, 1995

Experimental college proposed

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

A group ofGrinnellstudents are
proposing that the College support a
program oteourses that is taught by
individuals other than faculty and
that recognizes the education stu«
dents receive outside ofits academic
courses.

Miles Stem ‘96 and JR. Osborn
‘97 have organized n proposal to the
College which would create a pro
gram granting credits toward Stu»
dents' grnduniion requirements for
their participation in extra—curricu—
lar actiVities because of their contri—
bution to the liberal arts education.

“Basically, we want to open up
classes to be taught by studentsI fac—
ulty and members of the communi—
ty,” says Stern. The diverse skills and
knowledge of these individuals could
proVide valuable educational oppor—
tunities and serve to supplement the
traditional academic curriculum.
The proposed progmm would reﬂect
students' interests in arts, crafts, com—
munityserVice,recreationan “pmo
tical skills," like auto repair.

students interested in public
serVice or education or administra—
tion could benefit from the program
because or the experience in leader—
ship and self—governance. Intern—
ships typically provide the only up
portunrry to exercise these skills.

As Stern explains, these activir
tics form another “kind of curricu—
lum" which is well represented on
campus by the numerous student
groups whose members receive no
recognition on their transcripts for
their involvement. Both students
would like to see the College recog—
nrze this education on students’ tranr
scripts, which the proposed program
credits would show.

Courses in the proposed pro—
gram would be created by srudents,
faculty or community members and
presented to a committee ofstudents
forapprovalon educationalcommie
merit and integrity. The proposal is
based upon the Experimental Cob

lege program which Oberlin College
has provided since 1968 and defines
itselfas “a credit offering, student run
department," according to the 1995
Fall Catalog. The credits would only
supplement the llé—credit gradua—
tion requirement, but not apply to a
specific division.

The attraction of recewtng credit
for such activities, feels Stern. would
get more students and others in—
volved. Groups who suffer now be«
cause of poor participation might
experience more student interest if
the College recognized the merit of
such activities by granting credits on
a transcript.

”There [would be] some incen—
tive to commitment when you get
academic credit," he says. “One of
the things I’m really excited about is
that it would help bolstersome of the
community service projects."

A similar program, called the
Free University, existed at Grinnell
in 1970 and in 1973 without the
provision of credits, but offered stu»
denterun courses in photography.
yoga,Christianity,beerbrewmg,pipe
smoking and contemporary human<
ilies.

The proposed credit system
would allow students to maximize
credits per semester in areas other
rhon music pertnrmnnce, phystcail
educatron,orthe plus-Zoption. Stern

imagines the program courses would
complement a typical schedule and
not substitute for academic credits.

The rinoneiol needs ofthe pro.
gram would be small. As an example,
Oberlin‘s Experimental College pro—
gram is the largest at the school, yet
budgets only $7,000 each semester
because it uses the school‘s existing
resources and does not pay teachers.

For now, Osborn and Stern are
advertising their proposal through
the Student Government Associa—
tion and sending copies to President
Ferguson, the Chair of the Board of
Trustees, Dean Duke and other inc»
ulty.

“That’s what we‘re working on
now: getting support,” says Stem.
Despite their enthusiasm, such a cut—
riculum change is difficult because it
requires a faculty initiative.

Charles Duke, Dean of the Col—
lege, also cited the challenge before
the proposal: “It would take a pretty
thought out proposal, and faculty
support and community support."

The students recognize that the
program could successfully exist out»
side ofthe credit system but with the
participation and appreciation of the
College in another capacity. Stern
acknowledged their idealism at this
stage, saying, “It might potentially
work, but it might reflect something
we already have."
