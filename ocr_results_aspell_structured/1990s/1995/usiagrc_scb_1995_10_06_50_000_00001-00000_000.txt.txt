Withpre-regrstrationcomplete,
the coordinators of the Sesquicen—
tennial interim Session srruggle to
accommodate copious enrollment
numbers they did not expect.

“We had originally thought 300
[students] was a realistic number,”
says Wayne Moyet, Sesquicentenni—
al coordinator, “but that was clearly
an underestimate.“ By last Friday,
561 students had submitted registrar
tion cards.

Moyer expressed concern about
this large number because it exceeds
the College's current preparations
for the session.

The major problem, explains
Professor Moyer, is that the goals and
expectationsofthe session cannot be
metwitha large enrollment. Certain
classes, such as puppetry and writing
workshops, demand smaller, more
personal class sizes, he says. The
indiVidual limitations of alumni in—
structors also inﬂuence this number,
and Moyer will be contacting in—
structors this week to evaluate insti—

tute capacities.

The most undesirable situation
for Mayer would be to limit the en—
rollment number. “1 don't want to
cut," he explains, “I‘m exploring ev—
ery option first." Students would be
closed out on a random basis and
evenly distributed among the class
levels.

At a meeting for entertainment
programming, student coordinators
expressed reluctance about this idea
oflimiting enrollment,and explained
that the unique opportunities of the
session should be available to all stu—
dents.

Moyer and other session admin»
istrarors are evaluating the situation
heavily this week and hope to reach
final decisions before Friday. Octo—
ber13th. Moyerhascommittedhim—
selfto inform students oftheit tegis»
tration status before {all recess.

After the break, an information—
a1 meeting for students will pI‘OVKle
general information and answers on
the session. Students who have been
accommodated must then confirm
their registration by November 3rd.

“We need a place/Not to be one—
clown/But to be equal/A place where
we are notdrfferent/For a little time
at least/A place where we don’t fear."
The excerpt from this poem, “To—
ken" by Natasha Josefowitz was pro—
vided by Rachel Weiss ‘98 in aprevi-
ous interview on multiculturalism.
At the time, Weiss mentioned that
the poem summarized her views re,
garding her need for multicultural
space.

Since that interview, and well
before, several students have voiced
various concerns over the need for
bettermulticulturalfacilitiesatGrin—
nell. While views may differ among
students, members of the multicul<
tutal community have been meeting
to represent their collective needs
for space. Students once again pube
licized the issue to the Grinnellcom—
munity by submitting a letter to the
S&B and posting an informal letter,
“A Need for Space," in dormitory
bathrooms.

The space committee has been
meeting and working with the ad—
ministrationontheissuefortwoyears.
This September, four Grinnell stu—
dents, representing four different
multicultural organizations, met in«
formally With two tnistees to discuss
what they recommend students do to
ensure that theirneeds are met. That
meeting followed two previous en<
counters with the Board of Trustees
in which proposals were made to the
board. Both student proposals were
rejected.

Tom Crady, Dean of the Col—
lege and Vice President of Stu—
dent Affairs, has been working with
the space committee on these issues.
Crady. who was also present each
time the students addressed the board,
comments, “I see the benefit to the
campus concerning space."

He mentions innr his primary
concern is that the needs of the mule
ticiiltural groups are met. Secondarr
ly, he adds that it is important that
the centers are open to the campus
because they also have tremendous
educanonalvalue. However, he clar<
ifies that the educational aspect of

Studﬂts, Crady speak on space issue

added multicultural space “shouldn't
compromise the needs of the groups,
and I don't think it will."

Although Crady acknowledges
the diversity of opinions which still
create some disagreement, he notes,
“there is more agreement among
committee members than there has
been in the past." Crady believes
that the current situation revolves
around exactly how to meet the need
for multicultural space.

According to Crady, the past
14 years have been devoted to teno<
vating the residence halls and col—
lege houses. The plans for the sci»
ence building and fine arts are the
current economic commitments of
the college. The minutes for the last
SGA ]oint Board Meeting mention
that students have discussed the pose
sibility that construction may take
another five to six years.

The Trustees asked multicul—
tural students to consider these fi'
nancial and other issues when they
turned down the student proposals.
In fact, when the students addressed
the board last year, the trustees sug—
gested that students seek space al-
ready on campus, perhaps tempo—
rary space in dormitory lounges.
However, multicultural students re<
jected that proposal.

YayomiSuzuki ‘97,ASIASpace
Committee Representative, explains
that multicultural students are not
interested in taking space away from
other groups or individuals,

The SGA Joinr Board discussed
the multicultural issue, concluding
that the Tmstees disagree only with
the idea of providing separate space.
Suzuki believes, "The Board oanist—
ees recognizes the need for space,
but so far no acceptable offers or
actions have been made to meet
these needs." Suzukicontinues, “Be-
cause the student body sees no tan—
gible results, the issue is stagnant."
Suzuki and other Space Committee
membersnte continuingtomeetand
revise possible proposals, including
possible additions to the Forum.

Cradyadmitsthatthe complete
fulfillment of multicultural needs |S
several years down the road. He
agrees that students need to look at

the long term. He cites the example
of the Harris Center as another stu-
dent initiated issue which took time
to develop. Crady explains that Har-
ris was not completed until some of
the students who initiated the project
graduated.

The multicultural issue has al—
ready gone through the Presidential
Task Force and been examined by
visiting other colleges. The Fresh
dential Task Force was assigned upon
the arrivalof President Ferguson. The
committee heard student concerns,
including multicultural issues. Ac»
cording to Crady, the final report of
this committee included multiculture
al issues and was presented to Fergu—
son one year after the committee had
been formed.

Crady’s comments were made to
address concerns that students have
been working on the issue for some
time, but have only recently been
heard by the Board ofTrustees. Crady
says, “I think we needed to do the
work we did before [multicultural
concerns] went to the trustees." Ideo»
logically, he believes that “before an
issue can be taken to the trustees,
there should be consensus."

In response to speculation that
the administration might drop the
issue after certain students graduate,
Crady stresses, "myplansate to contin—
us working on this [project] until we
address student needs."

Crady adds, “What I want to do
is continue to work on this issue and
move it forwar .”

in fact, Suzuki also expresses her
view that “It’s important to keep this
issue moving forward tp be able to see
the contributions of the students of
color."

Suzuki adds, “I would like more
student reaction and I definitely wel-
come it. If they want to email me,
that‘s fine," Both letters submitted by
students of multicultural groups asked
snppprrive Grinnellians to email
Crady or write letters of support to
the 8&5. Student responses were
requested after “A Need for Space“
claimed that “this issue has not lost
momentum after 5 years. We hope
that the 6th year will show more
success.”
