people to listen to something other than what they may normally hear.” He notes ”Music is the ultimate
expression of the human soul and it is done a tremendous disservice by classifying it by types and
genres." He lists representative artists like Los Lobotomies, Neil Diamond, Foreplay, Billy Joel, Wynton
Marsalis, Sex Pistols, Big Country, Steve Lukather, Girl Friday, China Crisis, and the Pogues.

Rolling Stones."
