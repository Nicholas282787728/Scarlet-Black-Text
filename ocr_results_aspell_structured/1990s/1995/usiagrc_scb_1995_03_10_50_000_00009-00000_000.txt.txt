Name calling, abuse of Pallas
reason for silent campus

Finally someone has kicked Grinncll's

heard on this campus areal dtsctissrort ot

last week’s responses to Chns Pallas’

last week would bc enough to silence
anyone. Only the letter ﬁom Rachel
Phillips seemed to object to Pallas in a
reasonable trianner. Even acermin pro-

Pallasan“asshole“ in front of her class! 15
this what we expect of our professors
when a dissenting opinion is voiced?
Which brings me to a particularly
poignant letter from last week, That from
our illustrious professor Scott. [read and
reread Pallas’ aniele aucmpting to find
where exactly he aocusod Scott of being
incompetent Ifound no such thing. 1
found only a quesnoning of the underly—
ing assumption of aﬂirrnative action:
namely, that all candidates involved are
equally qualiﬁed. there were no refer-
ences or even allusions to Scott or her
colleagues. However. Scott betates hint

of her own: Pallas is araCisL Finally, she
wants him notto step “where fools fearto
tread". This eloquence seems to me an

undisguiscd threat: don’t mess with pre-
vailing opinion. My hat is off to Chris.
May he continue to stomp where fools
fear to tread.

Librarian responds to Pallas

i [want] to respond to several statements
made by Chris Pallas in his editorial “Is
Multiculturalism a Problem at Grinnell?”
First, I would like to respond to
ﬁllas’ commons about thecumculum. l
don’tthink that anybody IS lobbying fora
separate course on “every possible culr
ture.‘ Yes, there are new courses that
should be added, but a major objective in
diversifying the curriculum is to adapt
existing courses to represent a more true
picture of this country and the world as it
exlsts. For example, courses in music or
artlnstoryincludewomenanistsandeom-
posers, amstsandeomposersofcolor, and
the traditional group of white male com-
posers; American history courses present
the history ofall inhabitants of this coun-
try, not excluding, but not limited to the
European/British immtgrant (I recom-
mend the recent book by Ron Takaki. A
Different Mirror: A History of
Munich/tum! America, 1993, as a good
example of this different approach to his-
tory), Iinvile tnterestedpoopletocome to

ing courses. or to add new courses. is not
to mmper with ancient truths, butto con-
tinue the pmss of development and
reﬁnement that has been going on sinoe
the when of the educational institution.
Second, I‘d like to comment on the
statement "The college also pursues an

completely erroneous. Iﬁnd ildifﬁcultto
dignify it withaiesponse, butlamunable
to ignore it Chris Pallas should investi-
gate afﬁmtauve action procedures and
perhaps sit in on some classes taug-lt by
faculty of color before making such a
comment It is amistaken assumption to
think that the system was color or gender
blind before afﬁrmative action was in
place (only 25 years) and I doubt that Ihe
system will be color or gender blind if
afﬁrmative action is done away with. I
mean, of course. that the white male has
been favored in this country and has only
been competing for employment ui a
realistic job market for the past 25 years.

in die past few years, but it isn’t nearly
enough, Mutticuluitalism is not a dirty
word, it shouldn‘t threaten anyone It is
about inclusion, not exclusion; it is about
enrichment, not impoverishment As a
member of this community, as a thinking
human being. as the mother of two chi]—
ehen. as a lover of literature and music, I
can only gain ﬁrom the trend toward
multiculturalism.
