Sports in our society: a new
coach and a new attitude

Soon ANDERSON
STAFF WRITER

Team chemistry is a very vital
aspect of successful sporting teams.
Not only for racking up victories, but
also for increasing an athlete’s enjoy<
merit of their sport and their team—
mates. Understanding the nuances
of the team's collective attitude can
be a daunting task, Here arGrinnell,
there is a situation that highlights
some of these difficulties.

Like other coaches, Orinnell’s
swimming coach Erin Hurley is at-
tempting to foster a positive team
image and bonds betweenherself and
the athletes Her task though is even
more daunting considering she is re»
plating legendary coach Roy Obere
millcr. Obermillet was the coach for
the last thirty years and was clearly a
very popular coach who ran his team
in a very distance mannet.

Swrmmers at Grinnell are be-
ginning to adjust to the change in
coaching philosophies of new coach
Erin Hurley. Hurley hrings energy
and vibrance to a team used to the
laid back, almost grandfatherly no.
tute ofObermiller; accord mg to wom—
en’s captain Kelly elements, ‘96.

The biggest difference is evi«
tlent at practice. Where Ohermiller
mostly Worked With the divers and
allowed the swimmers to set their
own pace; Hurley stayswith the swim—
mers, constantly watching and en—
couraging them to make difficult ins
tervals. Under Hurley’s more inten-
sive program, swimmers have been
working harder this year than laSt;
”Everyone's pretty psyched," said
men's Caecﬂptuln Matt Hutchison.

Sophomore Keyin Notheis also
earned alleconference honors, which
goes to the top 15 finishers, by plac—
ing lzth in 28:04 Another sopho—
more, Not Hopkins, was rust 10 sec.
onds off all-league standards with a
28:19, good for 18th plnce. Sopho<
more Kentner Cottingham rounded
out the scoring in 37th place.

“Of our top seven runners we
have three Juniors, threesophomores
and one freshman. This is a solid
groupthot is justgoingto get hetter,"
commented Freeman. “1 expecrwe’ll

test-n tetutntng, we have a great op.
portunity for good runners to come
and learn forayear. Hopefully in the
fall of 1996 there Will be no pressure
on our rookies. Well Just expect
them to learn and adopt to our pro.
gram and trainingrhcory. Thenwhen
they are sophomores they will be
counted on as the top runners. Hope-
fully we can attract five to seven
athletes who are capable of running
with our top group," concluded
Coach Freeman.

Some swimmers have had [tout
ble adjusting to the added attention
because itrepresentsashift in philos»
ophies, Clements says under Ober—
miller “motivation was more inter—
nalthan external, ldidn‘t wantto let
Obe down. " With Hurley the moti»
vatron is at the end of every lap
encouraging swimmers to keep mak—
ing difficult intervals. The reward
for swimmers according to Clements
is “l felt so good about finishing a
hard set. It was a real feeling of
accomplishment,"

AssistantCoachlimRandallsaid
Hurley’s attention to the swimmers
has resulted in increasedsttoke work,
improving the quality of swimmers
sttokes,

Another big change has been
Hurley‘s insistenceon attendingptzicr
rice. A student who wanted to swim
three days a week and lift the other
two was told lie/she had to make the
full commitmentto the tenrnotthey
wouldn‘t swim in the meets even
though they had the talent. Hutch-
ison likes the philosophy, “Commit—
ment is a change for the better. It's
something we really needed.”

Because the size of the team has
dropped so drastically from 70 last
year to thirty thts year, Hurley cane
celed the early practice session.
SWimmers used tohave the optionof
practicing at 2:30pmor 4:30pm, now
everyone practices at 4:30. “l like it.
It’s good we practice together all the
time. It’s good for team unity,”
Hutchison commented.

Gaining experience through
three years of Division lll coaching,
two in Division I, and four years as a
Dmsion I swimmer, Hurley tries to
combine the host ofhet experiences

into her coaching technique.

“I try to combine the best of the
sport of swimming re, the feeling of
swimming fast through the water,
the team atmosphere that can be
created within an individual sport,
the growth and improvement not
only in swimming, but also aperson—
al growth and the best of coaching
i.e., providingachallengingand pet.
sonally rewarding atmosphere for the
swimmers, proViding the means that
allow the sWimmers to reach their
goals, determining the type oftrarn—
ing, trying to figure everyone out,
trying to make a positive impact in
their lives." Hutley said.

Swrmmets set their own goals
with Hurley. She tries to help swim»
mers achieve a balance between
swrmmmg and the rest of their lives
because she believes it‘s easy forswim—
mers to base too much of their self—
eeteem on swimming.

“My job is to see that the person
who wants to go to nationals goes,
and the person who wants to make
the traveling team makes it." Hutley
said about her coaching philosophy.

lnvolving the captains in team
decisions is a priorityfor Hurley She
uses them as n sounding board (or
new ideas and for their thoughts on
how the team is feeling

Hurley admits there are high
expectations afterboth teams’ l‘iistor
ry of success, but that pressure won’t
come for a few years until she has had
a chance to recruit swimmers. Given
that with her positive style she dou—
bled rhe size of the Illinois Wesleyan
team in two years, she should have
no trouble tectuiting for Grinnell
and building a team to rival those of
the past.
