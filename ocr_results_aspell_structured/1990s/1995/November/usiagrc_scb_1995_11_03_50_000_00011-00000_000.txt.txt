Have youever relr like you want—
ed to participate in athletics but you
didn’t have the talent to play a varstr
ry sport.7 Ifso, then the special inter—
est tournamentsare exactly what you
are looking for. Thcrc are many
positive aspects of SI sports that the
whole campus should know about.

Special interest sports give stu—
dents the chance to compete with
friends and have fun in a variety of
different sports in a relaxed armo»
sphere. Open to anybody with a
college ID, the special interest sports
programs at Grinnell drier opportu»
nities to students who aren’t stars in
athletics to come out and play. Cor
Director of the program Jeff Boyle,
‘96, says the intramurals “are relaxed
and not competitive."

By switching the name from in—
tramurals to special interest sports,
the program is trying to escape the
traditional role of dorms competing
against one another. Instead ofseg»
regating the campus by dorm loca«
tion or by North vs. South campus,
participation is instead designed to
foster camaraderie among friends.

Teams are usually formed through
groups of friends and captains are
simply chosen by the piavets.

Boyle tries to encourage a tee
laxed atmosphere when he officiates
games. Forexample; “Inflag football
there was a questionable call about a
guy catching the ball out of bounds.
I asked the guy, ‘wete you in or were
you out,’andleft itupto him." Boyle
explained. Rules don’t have to be as
formal in special interest sports thus
increasing the relaxed atmosphere.
While Boyle admits it is difficult to
make the leagues fair for less compete
itive players due to the small size of
the school, players still can Just go
out and enjoy themselves.

Special interest sports is pro—
rnoting team and individual touma—
ments this semester. So far there has
been a ﬂag footballseasuti and tennis
toutnament, According to CosDi-
rector Clayton Kaneshiro ‘97, last
Saturday at the tennis tournament,
the fourteen participants were slowly
trimmed down to the final four. In
the semifinals, Jason Kam defeated
Dright Burks 8.1 and Frank Dayls
outplayed Kai Landowne 8»Z. On
Sunday morning, Davis won the tour—
nament defeating Karn 84.

In two weeks there will be a

chess tournament. Interested stu—
dents should contact Matthew Cro-
co. Later this semester. tbree«one
three basketball and H—O—R—SrE
tournaments will be held. Kaneshit
to said a season or tournament for
any sport can be created if students
can generate enough interest.

Next spring, ultimate frisbee
and sand volleyball tournaments are
planned. In late winter a compett
rive basketball leaguewillfoi-m. The
faculty even has a team in the has
kerball league. One of Boer's goals
this year is to involve the faculty in
other special interest sports. This is
a great way to get them here on
weekends and havepositive student
and staff interactions outside of the
classroom.

Information about special in-
terest sports opportunities are usuale
ly posted by the dining halls before
the touznaments start. If you have a
team of friends that want to panic—
|p2\[e, just look for the signs. For
players who want to play but can‘t
frnda team, they only need to vax or
call Boyle or Kaneshiro, as teams are
constantly looking for extra players.
It ls that easy to participate in orga—
nized athletic tournaments here at
Orinnell.
