ighway 6 has fascinated
me from the time I ﬁn
rshed Driver’s Educa-

tion and started traversing the
countrysrde on my own, Years
ago, before the construction of
Interstate 80, 6 was one of the

also known as the Lincoln High—
way — U.S. 6 runs right through
my nativeIowa City, and thesmall
towns and state parks offer scenic
alternatives to the sterility of
interstatesr

Towns like Ladora, Homestead,
Tiffin and Oxford offer mstlc
scenes orowalife, though itdoes
run through Iowa City’s ugly

try taking 6 east to Iowa City on
somesunny springday, and you’ll

to Des Moines, though it merges
with 1-80 on the way there. It
offers some beautiful scenery,
better than the black—and-white
photos reproduced here on news—
