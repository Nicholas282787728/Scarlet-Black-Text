Crime wave hits Grinnell campus, town

By ANDY HICKEN
Stair Writer

AMPUS crime seems to be on
the rise. at least it’a rash of
thet‘ts iii the past two weeks is

any measure, In the past several weeks,
students have reported large sums or
money. Jewelry and CD5 stolen rront
unlocked dorm rooms and buildings.

“I feel Violent toward that person.
in saw that person, I would go to jail
ror assault and battery,“ said sophor
more Doug Wood or the person who
stole money from his room last Thtirsr
day, April 13. Wood is one or the
victims of the apparent crime wave
that has the campus plastered with
notices about missing CDs and Jewr
eiry.

Wood had about 300 dollars stor
lcn from his room on Read Third. His
noonnate, sophomore Brian Mundy,
lost aboutoo dollars from his room the
Same night Additional items stolen
from elsewhere on campus include a
portable CD player and 13 cos be-

longing lo senior Matthew Athei'ton
that were taken from the Math Lab.
Fil'tyCDs were also stolen rroin sopho-
mol‘c Julic Robcrls' dorm room in
Haines.

Tho Grinnell Policc Department,
according to Wood, ”thinkls that] it‘s
someone I knowibccuusc my wallet
wasn't taken." This implies that the
burglars probably didn' t feel pressured
by time, the police said, Wood said
that ifthe thicl‘was someone he knew,
he or she wouldn't have needed to be
so fearful of him coming home; if he
had walked in on the perpeu-ator, “they
couldjust say, ‘oh, dude, I wasjust
whatever,‘ and I would accept that."

AncLherargumentforthcpolice's
theory IS that Wood and Mundy both
left their rooms at about 9.40 pm. on
Thursday and didn’t get back until
12:40 a.m. 'nie dorm doors are gener—
ally locked by the night watchpecple
at 10:00 pm, meaning there was little
time for a non-student to enter the
dorm before it was locked, they said.

Despite his loss, Wood remains
somewhat philosophical about tile is-
suc “I understand that [theft] is a part
or socicty where propeny is valued
and that it’s a symptom. But I think
there are some things that should be
respected, especially my private
space." Wood said that he Is not
allowing himself to consider the hy
pothcsis that the thiet or thieves are
acquaintances or his.

“I can’t question all of my inter-
personal bonds,” he said.

Otherincidentsalsoresultcd from
students‘ havtng too much trust in
Grinncll being a crimerfree place and
leaving their rooms unlocked. The
Haines theft was from an unlocked
room and the CD player was left unatr
tended in a computer lab. Corporal
Teresa Peterson, the Grinnell Police
Department’s liaison to the college,
said that this level oftrust is common
in Griniiell.

eighteenth annual Grinnell
Relays will be held on Mac
Field next Saturday, April 29.

Thisycar'slhcmcis“TheNectarofllle
Gods."

The Relays are a daylong series
oinonrconlpclitive events that parody
the seriousness and competitiveness
oftlle college experience and provide
students with a way to forget the stresses
and pressures they arc under, accord
ing to Professor Wayne Moyer, Re-
lays Committee t’aculty advtsor.

Students join their departmental
teams and compete against other dcr
partments. Undeclared mayors can
create their own team orjoin any team
they wish, The Anthropology departr
menl “won" last year.

Shakti Narnyan, the SGA Social
Coordinator and Relays Committee
Chairperson. is counting on the entire
campus to participate. He nolcs that,
“Without a good turnrout, Relays will
not be as successful as it was in the
past. 01’ course, we have an added
advantage if the weather is good." It
can't be much worse than last year,
when it snowed tor a good pan ofthe
morning and remained overcast and
cold for the rest,

The ﬁrst Gnnncll Relays were
held in May of 1973 to celebrate the

arrival of spring and provide a respite
from the academic pressure thatbuilds
as exams approach. That basic pur-
pose remains uuchanged. According
to Moycr, the original organizers felt
that the Relays should parody such
competitive games as the Olympics
and the Drake Relays and give stu-
dents an opportunity to relax and have
a good time. The organizers also bcr
lieved that, in academic work, some of
students‘ most iniportantqualitiesweie
leftuntested. Therefore, they designed
a series of games to test these impor
tant skills.

In the past, one game was the
celebrated Milwaukee Beverage Ros
1ay,inwhicli teain membersrun around
a rectangular ﬁeld, chugging a beer at
each of the tour corners, thus making
adcl'initivc test oftlte corrcclrclalione
ship bctwccn mind, body and spinls,

Then there was theBabe Ruth Bat

Relay, which was the ulLimate test of
the physics of falling bodies. Indi—
viduals ran a fiftyryard course, put
theirheads on the end of a baseball bat
placed vertically in the ground. rotated
around the batten times and returned
to the starting line.

Other events included the Ping
Pong Ball Shot Put, the Wheelbarrow
Sack Race and thc Alerarnpus Tug-
of»War, The motto ofthe Relays was,
“Form is at least as important as sub
stance, It doesn‘t matter whether you
win or lose. It's the spirit ofthe thing
that counts.“ After the games, there
was an a11.campuspicnic, followed by
a ﬁlm festival.

After the ﬁrst year's success a
parade was added the nextyear, featurr
intheGrinnellKazooMarchingBand.
The Relays became an allrweekend
event, beginning on Friday night with

Titular Head, which originally was a
talent show to pick the reigning mon-
arch for the games, followed by a late
night ﬁlm festival. Saturday morning
began with the “Bloody Mary and
Bagel Breakfast" in Younker Lounge,
complete with Roadrunner and Bugs
Bunny cannons. The parade began
right afternoon, followed by the opens
mg ceremonies, the games and picnic
and. ﬁnally, a party in Darby.

The tradition lasted until 1987.
That year, lowa raised the drinking
age to 21, causing a suspension ofthe
Games, Two years ago Ben Wohlauer
revived the games,

Grinnell is proud to continue the
Relays this year with new and im»
proved games. O'Doul's is our generr
ous sponsor.

To those who participate,may the
Gods be on your Side!
