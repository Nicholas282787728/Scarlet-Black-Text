The Club Scene: Water polo

By ERIN HUSTINGS

Staff Writer

ECAUSE Grinnell is a corn
B paratively small school, itis

easy to be surprised by the
number of spons played here. In
particular, students may be surprised
to ﬁnd exotic sports such as water
polo on the list ofclub teams. While
most Americans only have the op
portunity to see this sport when it is
played in the Olympics, it has been
available to Grinnellians for at least
eight years, according to unofﬁcial
coach Matt Haber.

“I imagine it started as a way for
swtmmers tojusi mess around, relax
and have a fun time, yet stay in the
water and keep ﬁt." Haber said.

Because of the importance of
swimming in waterpolo, mostofthe
team's members come fromthe swim
team. Both men and women swim—
mers take part, making Grinnell’s
water polo team one of few co-ed
teams on campus.

As is the case with several other
club sports, there are fall and spring
seasons in water polo. Grinnell‘s
team is most active in the fall, when
members of the swim team play to

get in shape for the coming season.

“Our fall practices were well-
attended,usually getting 15—20 people
ateach one,”Haber said. “Butswimr
mers tend to get burned out after
swim season and do everything pos—
sible to avoid the pool."

As a result of this, the current
season is starting slowly. The team
usually hosts a “buttnaked” toumar
ment during the spring, which unfor-
tunately will not take place this year.

In a typical season, the water
polo team tries to schedule matches
against schools of comparable size.
like Knox, Cue, Maealester, and
Carleton. It does well against these
teams, winning, in Haber‘s estima-
tion, 70-80 percent of its games.
Against larger schools like the Unia
versity of Iowa and Iowa State, how—
ever, the team comes up against stron-
get and faster players who play year-
round, and doesn‘t fair as well.

Water polo players practice two
or three times a week. As with any
club sport, these practices are some-
times serious, and sometimes fun.

Haber played the sport in high
school on a successful team and is
well acquainted with its ﬁner points.

“[1 try] to teach people the basic
rules, along with some of the more
fun underwater advantages that can
be gained where the refs just can’t
see," he said.

Water polo is played at Gnnnell
for enjoyment, and at the same timeis
great conditioning for swimmers,

“We play primarily for fun. It’s
also a great way to get in shape for the
swim season in the fall," said Haber,
“But we do take games seriously."
