Race shouldn t be any

Gnnnellian s deﬁning trait

T can you tell about a person by his physical attributes?

indicatethatanythingis presentirione‘spersonality, Withailthereccntdebateabout

so much importance on moe are many, We risk enooutaging stereotypes, like that
all Afncan-Americans on campus like rap and hiphopmusie or that allAsians stay
in and study every weekend. When someone makes a judglnentbased on race, this
judgment will most likely include some component otstereorypes associated with
that person‘s race.

Another problem that arises when so much emphasis rs placed on me is that
pwple learn to see people of other races as diﬁerent than themselves. Humans
gravitate towards odiers who share their
interests and with whom they have some
thing in common If, for instance, a

age that anyone with dark skin is some»

The important thing to remember is that we are only physically different.
Attitudes, interests and personality traits are not inhented according to race. The

Race is only a physical attribute, Itshould not be a deﬁning trait to anyone, and
