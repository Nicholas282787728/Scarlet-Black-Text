The minute I stepped onto cam-
pus Izist year. [he first thingsomeone
said to me was “you’re really lucky
you don’t have to live down south
with the freaks‘“

The moment first year students
move into the dorms, all the return-
ing students immediately begin to
poison thetr minds against the oppo—
site side of the campus. I'll admit
that even I made a few nasty little
comments about south campus to a
couple of first—years when they at—
rived. What I am actually trying to

get at is that the whole war between
North and South campus is ridicu-
lous.

Not everyone on South campus
is a hippie freak (I even know a
couple of people who are really into
the Bible who live down that \vay.‘ ).
There are a fair numberof freaks who
do live on south campus. but hey. so
what! Most of those freaks are my
friends (I love you Anthony). I do
know a lot of potheads who live south.
but there are a fair amount of pot—
heads who live tip North, [00. Not
everyone who lives on Southcampus

without collapsing. or at least gasping

less). But notalljocksare violent frat«

White

A poignant treatise on the Eue
ropean practice of courtly love. this
movie delves into the motives be<
hind love. lust. devotion. and obsess
sion. So much less ..... uh.... boring
than Blue. this movie touched me in
waysthat“MelrosePlace"neverwill.
The subtle and precise placement of
white in this film contrasts the “head
bashing" and “brain swelling“ use of
the color blue experienced in the
first installment of the three color
series. White explores the evolution
of a young Polish hairdresser as he
tries to win back the love ofhis wife.
Poor and homeless. he befriends a
sad old man who takes him back to
Poland to begin anew. So much not
like Blue.

Counterpoint (Taylor): I must
say I had high hopes for this film but
I feel that Blue was by far a better
film. Its focus was narrower and it
was precisely planned. but this film
seems to grasp at too many subjects
and moods. and I am left with an
empty hand. This film pales (as its
name suggests) in comparison to its
predecessor.

boy types. There are a few like that.
but not all jocks are assholes. In fact.
there are some really nice jocks.
There is even a nicejock on my staff
(I'm an SA) who’s name is Eric. I’ll
admit I was pretty surprised (hey. I
have my little prejudices against
jocks, too). but pleasantly so. I re«
member being shocked at hearing
really intelligent things come out of
ajock’s motithinclassonce.butnow
I’m used to it. I get tired of everyone
uniting against the jocks. They may
be a little boisterous at parties. but
think about It. they’re probably not
as bad as the jocks at University of
Iowa. Not everyone who wears a
baseball cap is bad.

I hope I didn’t offend anyone in
this column. becausethatwas notmy
purpose atall (I love all.or mostly all.
of the people on this campus). My
point is that there are more similari<
ties than differences among Orinnel-
lians. Ifwe were so radically different
we wouldn’t even be coming to the
same school. When other people
look at its they see the same thing (I
onceheardatowniesay we were 90%
fag). so we should love each other
instead of fosteringanimos ity. I can’t
wait to move off campus!
