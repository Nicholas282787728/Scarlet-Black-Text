OST students come to col
lege probably not expect
ing to witness a number

of talent shows. Al Grinnell,
however, several groups, includ
ing Stonewall Coalition, use the
format to show off their skills
and provide anevcning offunfor
students. Stonewall's Gay/Les-
bian/Bisexulil/Alllcd Talent
Show willlake place al9:30 p,m.
tonight at Harris,

The talent Show alid Harris
party following it are the Culmlr
natingeventsofthis week‘sPride
Week '95 celebration. In that
sense, Stonewall members say the
talent show is part of the effort

during Pride Week to unite GLB
students. “We usually stay iii our
own circles ot’t’ ’cnds, so tlietalr
ent show is a chalice for its to get
together 7 a defining, connect-
ing event," said sophomore Sar
rah Hallas. “We get to show our
diversity and out different tal-
ents,"

"We also try to include a bit
of the lewd alld ridiculous. “ said
senior Amy Necvel, “whether it
be a mockery at a completely
heterosexual commercial, or
fashion show featuring the wide
range of lesbian stereotypes, leather
dyke, cowdykc, intellectual dyke,
etc."

Other acts planned for the show
are students singing and performing

at entertaining the audience while
getting tlieln to think about their
perceptions ol' GLB people.

“The main point of the talent
show is to be tiuly celebratory of
who we lite and wlial our lives are
like and to connect wttli the clilire

through our skils atld perfor-
mances," said Ncevel. "Each year
thc show seems to get more diverse.
and this year we'll have a really
good mix, Some really talented
queer musicians on cullipus will be
performing but we’ll also have some
really ridiculous and funny slots

 

and lipsyncs."

Artwork and women's health, an

heated for Rajki. “Women's health, in
general I dunk, needs a lot of attention,
not only on this campus. Something I
want to do in the future is to have a
practice with a kind ofhollsttc thing for
women. But notjust for people who can

pay, ideally for a community. I would
hope that people from not just one socio-

Rajki.

Rajki envisions a cross between a
community center and a health center,
