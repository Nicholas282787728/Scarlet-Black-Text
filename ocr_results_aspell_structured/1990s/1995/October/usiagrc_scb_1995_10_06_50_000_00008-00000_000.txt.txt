Re: the Fate of the Vigil
To the campus community:

The Student Publications and
Radio Committee is reviewing Sul-
dent interest in the Vigil, Grinnell‘s
human rights yournal. The vigilwas
founded lnl993 asahiannualcollco
tion ofart, poetry and academic es-
says relating to human rights issues,
It has failed to meet expectations in

a number of ways, specifically: severe
lackofsubmissions,poorsalesandno
interest in staff membership or edit
torshrp for the fall 1995 semester.
Due to an increasingly inadequate
SPARC budget in which all current-
Iyactive publications are beingforced
to make concessions, it is impractical
and unrealistic to fund a publication
that is no longer Viable and active.

SPARC will be making any EX-
isting back issues of the Vigil avail—
able to the campus community by
placingthem in the postoffice. Please
express your opinion concerning the
future of the Vigil by VAxing

What MakesaDepariment
Strong?
To the editor:

What makes an academic de»
partmentatGrinnellCollegeastrong
one? According to Mr, Lalonde [in
his Sept, 22nd letter to the editor].
“the strength ofan academic departr
ment depends on its faculty’s teach»
ing, scholarship. and ability to ad«
ministrate a proper program." In
light oer. Lalonde’s emphatic crit—
icrsm of Mr. Richard's state ment that
Grinnelldoes not haveastrong soci-
ology department, I would like to
focus on Mr. Lalonde‘s last criterion
for a strong departmentethe ability
to administrate a proper program.
Surely any “proper [academic] pro-
gram” would require a sufficient of—
fering ofcoutses, in terms ofvnriety
and quantity lam. however, forced
to conclude that Grinnell's sociolo»
gy department does not meet this
criterion. In the 199495 Course
Catalog. seven of a total ofsixteen
ZOO—level courses are listed as being
"not offered" under the sociology
department Likeivise,inthecurrent
Course Catalog. six of the fifteen
ZOO—levelsocmlogycoursesarelisted
as being “not offered " ls this some»
thing the department is proud of!
These figures can certainly be has
trating to sociology majors, and are
not encouraging for potential ma—
lots, nor are they iiwiting to the
student body in general.

My goal, however. is not to crit—
icizethesociologydepartmentalone,
not to reiterate Mr Richard’s state
ment, but rather to pomt out a Simh
lar occurrence in other departments
as well It is both disappomring and
frustrating forstudents to be excited
about an interesting course listed in
the catalog but only later to have
that excitement shattered by reading
the words “hm offcrctl” in fine print.
Likewise, selecting classes has be—
come more or loss a familiar adven—
tor: for students oi Grinnell. as we
are consianth left in the dark on the

question ofwhatcoursestotake. Our
indecision is hardly due to an over—
whelming variety of courses offered
by the College, but rather. in the
end, we are left to choose between
one or tivo classes, or not much ofa
choice at alll

Once again, I pose the question
ofivhat constitutes a strong academ—
ic department at Grinnell College,
and call into concern Orinnell's true
commitment to nCaClCn’llCS,

Regarding ‘Sexual Assault
Policy Challenged'

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter in re.
sponse to last week’s front page artit
cle, ”Sexual Assault Policy Chalr
lenged." First, I would simply like to
point out that some ofthe informa—
tion in this article is inaccurate, The
article mentioned that a Presidential
Task Force was involved in writing
the current procedures for sexual as«
sault cases. However, the fact that
this task force was made up of thirty
members and worked on dei eloping
these procedures for one and one
half years was left Out. In addition,
the article states that the sexual asr
sault pamphlet, which was distribut—
ed to students last week. only tells
students whom they should contact.
This is also not true, as the sexual
assault pamphlet has a lengthy sect
tion dedicated to defining sexual as«
sault, as well as a section which dis»
pels several myths regarding sexual
assault, as well as “who to contact "

Anothetpoint made in the am.
cle was that students who have raised
concerns about the current form of
the sexual assault proccdurcs wcrc
haying “difficulty” in making their
obiections heard. thus implying that
Tom crady is an unresponsive indi.
vidual. which he is not.

My final ohiection to [he "set.
iial Assault Policy Challenged" aiti.
cle is that it described the procedures
outlined in the student Handbook
as “bureaucratic,” The use or the
wold "bureaucratic" brings all sorts
of negative connotations into play,
inatltlitiontosettingiipan"us'wsni.
dents) against "them" (atlmlnlstta—
(ion) structure

ldid not write this letter in the
interest of defending Toni Crady.
[or] in the interest of making shit
dents' objections to the sexual as.
sault policy seem invalid instead,
my purpose was to aitcmpt to present
the facts as they reallyare, [and] inan
obiective manner, which is how the
article should have originally bet-n

In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE’I‘I‘NER

l only have one thing to say
about the verdict in the Simpson
trial. It’s more ofa question, really:
can we say that America has pro—
gressod in the area of racial equality,
considering that wealthy Black peo—
ple are now able to buy the same
brand of Justice as wealthy white
people?

no

Withfallbreakonlyaiieekaway,
all oftlie first.yearsl know are happi—
ly making plans to set their friends,
and. depending on which is applica.
ble, their boyfriends or girlfriends
again. lt's driving me nuts.

My first fall break was quite a
learning experience, I learned that l
was no longer in high school, and
that many of my friends from high
school, even haying gone offto col»
lege, were still stuck in that mental»
ity. Ilearnetlthatlreallydidn'thavc
much in common with them any—
more. most ofthein havmg gone ei«
ther to lvy or state schools, or, for
some, no school at all. Grinncll
occupies that weird middle ground
that changes you forevetiyou're not
lvy, you're not state. .what are youl

I couldn’t answer that one fresh—
man year, but I could tell that it
created a gulf between me and the
people I knew. Now. I think it’s that
I’ve matured a lot more than the
state people, without picking up the

Scarlet & Blanch

snobbery ofthe ivys, I can definitely
say that l'rnamuch more open—mind—
ed. even a much friendlier, person
than I was in high school. I also quit
doing all the things associated with
freshmen when 1 came back.

l'rn hoping that the freshmen
will. once and for all, leave high
school and all of its attitudes and
behaviotismsbehlndthemwhenthey
return

I hope they'll stop sitting out in
the hallway late at night discussing
their high schoolgrade point averag
es and ACT and AP. and SAT (and
even PSAT) scores.

1 hope they'll stop talking about
the weight they're putting on here
and start going to the etc.

1 hope they'll leave these boy/
girlfriends behind, because they're
all miserable about it

I hope that some ofthe women
adopt a more practical attitude to.
ward dating than, as was once ob«
served by one of my floormates, “tee
hee,.,boys." and that some of the
men will stop talking about "getting
some" every time bar night rolls
around.

I hope they'll stopgetting home
sick every other night and calling
home (mainly because they can't af.
ford ir—one woman I know has a
$757 phone bill),

l hope they stop doing all these
things because I’ll kill them if they
don‘t.
