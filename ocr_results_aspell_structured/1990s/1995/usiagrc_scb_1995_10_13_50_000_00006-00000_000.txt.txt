The Orinnell College communi/

itself on being nondiscriminatory.

College community cannot stand for
iniustices such as these.

Scarlett & Black
In the Coffee?

BY DAN Bum-moo

The ethical issues involved in
editing a newspaper are quite a bit
more troubling than most of you
might imagine. Mr. DeVin Drown’s
letter to the editor this week has
brought some or those issues up. I
will rerrnin rrorn expressing my own
opinions about the letter, but there
are two things I would like to point
out to the campus community.

First, I am required to print sub»
missions, both by the Scarlet 8t
Black's current editorial policies, as
well as by the ethics of good journal—
ism, Refusing letters to the editor
because of their content would be
censorship, pure and simple. Racial
issues on this campus are far from
dead, but. for the reasons listed above.
I cannot refuse to print Mr, Brown‘s
letter, despite its ramiﬁcations for
racial issues at Grinnell.

Second. I would like to say that
the S&B’s Letters to the Editor...
section exists to allow students, fac»
ulty. even alumni, to express their
Views on current issues, It does not.
however, am as a forum for person—
al complaints, private agendas, or
inside jokes. My idea of what Lets
ters, .. is (or is idealized by SPARC‘s
letter regarding the Vigil last week,
or by Sam Coleman’s letter or twe
weeks ago regarding national welfare
reforms. These are important issues
which are relevant to everyone on
campus.

I hope that you will take advan»
tage of this forum, moreso than you
have to date, in order to publicize
issues on this campus, It can be avery
effective method ererreeting change.
