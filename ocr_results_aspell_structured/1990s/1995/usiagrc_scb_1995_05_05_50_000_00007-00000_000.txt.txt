Harris security staff too
large, waste of resources

By SARAH STAVETEIG

Arts 3: Entertainment Editor

ASTFnday, as an estimated 700800 studens gathered to watch the annual
LTitular Head ﬁlm fesLival, room on the Harris Center benches mu out and

so students squeezed into theaisles, overﬂowingonto the ﬂoor. The people
in the little red hats, the Harris Security team, wouldn't let the movies begin until
the walkways were clear. It was the ﬁrst timethal I ever felt we needed six security
guards atHarris. Generally, attheaverage Han-is parry, thesecunty staffis too large
and mostly ineffective.

Harris Security is supposedly presentto help control alcohol and to be around
in case of an emergency. It's true that the slams available in case of an emergency,
but their other responsibilities aren’t getting done. How many times have you, or
people you know, gotten in without an 1D? I've seen it happen a loL How many
underage people areserved alcohol during each Ham's party? And how onen are
staff members needed to prevent students from escaping with alcohol? (Heaven
forbid a studentbnngs alcohol ontothecarnpus.) How often is thedangerat Han-is
a wet dance ﬂoor, not a violent drunk?

Now, don't get me wrong. I don’t want Harris to be policed by stringent lD
checkers or a shaft that cards for beer.
The security staffls by no means incomv
pelent. but as a former Han-is guard, I

know that it doesn’t take long to ﬁgure EDITORIAL

exits where no one ever tries to escape

Security guards know how little their Jobs mean, When I was a volunteer

While the other one dozed. People began to flash their ID: at me. It didn’t seem
to make any differencewhatthe guards did. Ihesecurity personnel certainly know
how to chock IDs, but the people sitting at the door realize how little impact ID
checking really has, High school students, lhepeople weare trying to preventfrom
entering, are no strangers to Harris parties.

Asecuritystaff of sixalaregularHatris party is inevitablyawaste of Gnnnell
College's resources. It would only take halfthe number of people to do the
job. Not only that, but security will also be inefﬁcient as long as the staff’s
working conditions remain the same. When guards have to sit for hours
watching a party where nothing dangerous is happening, they tend to get bored
and stop paying attention. Letting staff ﬂoat around the party instead of just
watching would mean that they could keep a real eye on the spills and the
violent people, rather than passively sitting away from where the action is.
The guards at the door could take over Lhejob ofstarnping hands, thus giving
them something interactive to do with their time and allow them to take a
closer look at IDs. This would also save a volunteer from having to sit and
stamp hands (whatever the purpose of that is).

Security is necessary, yes. But Hams security as it is currently strucnired is
ineffecLive and overdone. Reducing the number of guards and changing security
roles would produceaneven morerelaxedatmosphere aridamoreresponsivestaﬂ‘.
