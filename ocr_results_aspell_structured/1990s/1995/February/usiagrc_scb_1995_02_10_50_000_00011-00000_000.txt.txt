OR speed and agility, rew ac
F tivities can match the art of
fencing. The sport, whichinr
volves personal combat with ﬂexible
swords. relies on quickness, control
and strategy.

According to Jeremy Giltner,
President of thc Grinnell Fencing
Club, fencing has been around ale
most as long as people have been
ﬁghting witlt weapons The sport
was originally developed to practice
sword play because “why fight with
2i stick when you can fight with a
sword?" he said.

Evenafterswordswerenolongcr

recreational ptist time and was brought
to America by European settlers.

Giltner suspects that fencing
began at Grinncll as a varsity sport,
but eventually lost varsity funding.
The club then became a gathering
point for hobbyists who dabblcd in
swordrplny and only competed
inlrainurally. This changcd during
Giltner's freshman year, when heand
