IGrinnell College men's basket

ball team this week as it tries to
make up ground in theMidwestCon
ference south-division race. Friday
the Pioneers travel to Coe for a 7:30
tilt against the divisionsleading
Kohawks. Next Tuesday, Cornell
comes to Darby Gym for a 7:30
match—up.

Coeis on top ofthe division with
an 8-1 mark While Monmouth is sec-
ond at 5- l . Grinnell holds a &3 mark
and Knox is 4-5. Cornell is in fifth
place at 1-5 and Illinois College is
dead last at 09.

“We cannot downplay the im
portance of the Coe game." Coach
David Arseneault said. “However,
every game the rest of the way is
important. Judging by the result of
the team's play last weekend, our
players understand the signiﬁcance
of every game.“

Coach Arseneault alluded to his
squad’s two home victories over
northsdivision foes Carroll and Beloit,
The triumphs came on the heels of

two disappointing losses on a north
division swing the previous week.

“Two things made the wins sign
niﬁcztnt," Arseneault said. “First,
our response to losses at Ripon and
Lake Forest and second, we played
our style of basketball."

The Ploneers' style is high-scor-
ing and fast paced. In a 129-116
victory over Carroll on Saturday the
Grinnellians rallied from a 13—point
deﬁcit in the second half.

“Despite the high score by
Carroll, we played very well defen»
sively," noted Arseneault. The Pio-
neers caused 29 turnovers and gave
the ball up just 14 times.

Four Grinnclllans scored in
double ﬁguresbutforwardEdBrands
stole the show, Brands started the
game with a scoring barrage, and hit
every big shot in the second-half
comeback. He scored 43 points on 14
of 28 field goal shooting, including
nine three-pointers Scoring mate
Sieve Diekrriann added 33 points.

In addition to scoring 10 and 18
points, guard duo Todd McGuire and
IeffBoylerackcd upiinpressive “urns
bers in other categories. Boyle had

eight assists, three steals and one
block, while McGuire had live as
sists and four steals. Andris Upitis
led the team with seven rebounds.

The next day the Pioneers
downed Beloit 131-92 to stay in the
hunt for a league playoff berth.
Grinnell controlled the tempo. post-
ing a 63-50 lead at halftime and
stretching that margin in the second
period. The Pioneer defense was
very active again, causing Beloit to
turn the ball over 32 times,
