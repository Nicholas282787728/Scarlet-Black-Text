Tomorrow’s Contract With America protest
will unite Socialists, Democrats on issue

By ANDY HICKEN
Staff Writer

s pan of a nau’oiini day or
protest,Grinnellsnidentswill
rally against the Republican

Contract Willi Americatornormw.

The hour—long rally, which will
be held at 2:00 pm. outside the Forum
(or in the North Forum Lounge, in the
case ofrzun), is being organized by the
Campus Democrats and the Grinnell
Socialists, Therally will teaturespeak-
ers from the Socialists and the Demo
erats, the Environmental Action Group
and Stonewall Coalition, according to
senior Tanya H‘rmCy. who will speak
for tile Socialists and is helping to
organize the rally. In addition, senior
Todd Foreman will speak on how the
Contract relates to crime issues.

The Contract With America is a
sctofCongrcssional initiatives which,
during last fall's election campaigns.
Newt Gingrich and other Republican
candidates for the Us House of Rep
rcsentativcs promised to try to imple-
ment if they were elected. The
Contract’sgoalsare generally oriented
toward smaller government and fewer
taxes. These goals will be accom—
plished by, among other things, make
ingithardcrtopass billsimplementing
new taxes, passing a line-item veto act
and a balanced budget amendment,
cutting welfare and Aid for Families
with DependcnlChildrcn (AFDC), and
granting a $500 per child tax credit to
iniddlerclass families (dcfinedasthose
families with a combined income of
up to $200,000).

Otherlegislativegoalsofthecon
tract are tougher sentences for crime,

cuts in social spending targeted to-
ward redueing crime in order to fund
more prisons and police, more tunding
for the military, making Social Secu-
rity available for weathier senior citi-
Zens, cutting capital gains taxes, abol-
ishing unfunded federal mandates on
states and corpomtions, and effecting
term limits.

Tomorrow’s national day ofpro
test against the Contract is being orga
nized by a group called the National
People's Campaign, which is trying to
buildanompartisan coalition in oppo-
sitioti to the Contract. The Grinnell
rally is being endorsed by Poverty
Action Now, the Native American Ine
lercsi Group, Grinnellians Escalating
Aids Response, thc Politically Active
Feminist Alliance. the Multi-Elhnic
Coalition, Chalutzim, Students in Don
fcnse ofAnimzilsandthc Environment
and the Faculty Women's Alliance.

Senior Jonathan Kissam, a mem-
bcr oflhc Grinnell Socialists. said that
aetitig together against the Contract is
crucial. He said that they want cvcry~
one at the rally “ because the Contract

with America is basically an attack on
everyone." “I think the most impor-
tant strategy to defeat the Contract
With America," Kissane said, was “to
build solidarity between different
groups, because ifthe environmental-
ists fight their fight, and the unions
right their fight, and they don‘t work
together, then [a successful
campaigan not going to happen."
Haney takes a similar, noneparti-
san stance. Remarking on the fact that
the Socialists and the Democrats are
working together on this issue. she
said, “We’re becoming more Goalie
lionebuilding, but I see that as our
strength, not ourweakness: we’reable
to put fonh the agenda we believe in,
but we also realize that a lot of other
people in a lot of odter organizations
believe in those same things. So in
stead ofdividing ortiniopartiesagain,
we're becoming stronger by ﬁnding
the common ground that we do have."
The rally’s purpose will be two-
fold, Zach Polsky, senior and Vice

President of the Campus Democrats.
