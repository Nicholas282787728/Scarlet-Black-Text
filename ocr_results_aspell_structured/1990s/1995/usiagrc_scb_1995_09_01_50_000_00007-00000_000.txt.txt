Grinnell’s new women’s golf team

KATHARXNE J noon
STAFF WRITER

With the recent formation of
the varsity women‘s golf team, Grin»
nell now offers an equal number of
men’s and women’s varsity sports.
When asked why women‘s golf was
chosen as the new varsity sport.
Coach Dee Farrchild cited that, in
addition to the interest expressed by
the Midwest Athletic Conference,
“golf is the fastest growing sport to—
day. lt’s an individual sport which
can be played by everyone."

According IOMS. Fairchild, who
is also the Director of Athlet ic Events,
the decision to create a omen’s golf
team was one that was i tially urged

by theMidwestArhlericConierence.
ofwhich Grinnell isamembet, Hav—
ing a women’s golf team was “not
really an issue of gender equity," says
Fairchild, in regards to the Federal
Law known as Title 1X, a code which
decrees that men and women must
have an equal opportunity to partic»
ipate in sports and other college ac—
tivities. The formation ofthe wom<
en’s golf team had more to do “with
interest," said Farrchild, as well as
the potential opportunities to play
withothercollegeswithintheMWC.
“Now includingGrinnell,fouroutof
[six] of the teams in the Southern
Division have varsity women‘s golf
teams,”Farrchild sard,theother three
being Coe, Cornell, and Knox.

All enrolled female students re—

ceived a request over the summer to
try out for the team, and following
the first practice on August 28, there
were six women members. The team
is comprised mostly of upperclass»
women, with one first year student.
Six women is more than enough to
play in conferences and at tourna/
menrs, says Fairchild, because the
team “needs to play five women, and
only four scores are counted."

Though still short of enough
teams to play an actual Conference
recognized tournament, the team will
be playing a Small College Tournar
ment on October 14 and 15. Until
then, the team will have meets at
other colleges, the first being at
Mount Mercy on September 8.

Water Polo

Practices, which should start
next week for the team, are on Tues»
days and Thursdays at the PEC from
5:00 unti116:00pm. There should be
a good turnout of swimmers, but cap-
tain Matt Hutchison stressed that
many of the players are tion—swim—
mers. No experience is necessary as
the team will teach the formations to
everyone. The team tries to have
fun, according to Hutchison, and is
looking to be in a few tournaments
this year. To get on the team’s mail—

Field Hockey

The Field Hockeyclubwas Stunt
ed on campus during the fall of 1992
by Eric Deman. According to De
man, Field Hockey is considered a
veryelegant sport in Europe andAsia.
Field Hockey requires dexterity and
movement and is one of the faster
sports in the world. Deman created
the club because “a lot of people in
Grinnellwere notfamiliar withhock—
ey, [and] I wanted to introduce them
to it.“ Field hockey meets Saturdays
from 3:00 untill 5:00pm and as De—
man emphatically stated, “Give it a
try; 1 guarantee you will like it." Vax

then has formal practices during the
winter. The bulk of the competitive
season is in the spring. According to
Brad Sikorski, Lacrosse is the fastest
sport on two feet. It is an aggressive
sport, but at the same time requires a
fair amount of skill. Sikorski stated
