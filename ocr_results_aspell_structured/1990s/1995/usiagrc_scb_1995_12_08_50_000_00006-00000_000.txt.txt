Last Week's Zirkle Article
To the Editor:

We ivere very upset to see the
lack of care put into [last week’s]
review of the Louis Zirkle show [in
Burling], Mt Anderson’s statement
that ”The late Louis Zirkle has creat-
ed many othet useless attitacts that
ate handytotpeeingon"wasapattic—
ularly distasteful remark, In the first
place. someone who views art as “use-
less” has no place wtiting a teview or
an art show, particularly when Zirkle’s
works show great care and mastery of
style. l=utthet, Mt, Andetson shows
no sense ottespeet totone ofthe best
artists to teach at Grinnell College,
or for his widow, who still teaches
here, when he says Zirkle's work is
“handy for peeing on"

We would expect that a respon—
sible editor would not have allowed
suchapathetic comment to be print-
ed, and find someone other than Mr.
Anderson to write reViews of art
shows, preferably someone who has a
concept of what artistic expression
is.

To whom it may concern:

lcannot believe that the editots
of the Scatlet at Black tead, pens
deted, and published Scott Ander—
son’s atttcie, “Adtnite atlde [sic]
sttuctutes in the libtaty."

Though, in my view, the arti-
cle’s otiensive ness is not contined to
this section, I will quote Anderson’s
second paragraph, the cote of his
abuse:

“The late Louis Zirkle [artist
behind the famed ‘Zirkle’] has creat«
ed many other useless artifacts that
ate handy tot peeing on. in his most
ingenious sculpture. Louis added a
bowl to increase it‘s [sic] usefulness."

The Editors ofthe 5&B, and the

Grinnell community at large' should
not tolerate such lnSui[Si

encoutage tesponsible att cttticisin.
Mr. Anderson’s review does not fall
into this category. Putting aside
Antletson's shaky gtasp oi the facts
and questionable intellectual posi-
tion, we feel obligated to respond to
comments contained in the second
paragraph of his article As former
colleagues of Professor Louis Glenn
Zitkle and as teachers and practitio—
nets otatt, we ate deeply offended by
Mr. Anderson‘s characterization of
these sculptures as “useless artifacts
that are handy for peeing 01L” We
find this remark misinformed, taste»
less, and gtossly insensitive. Mt.
Anderson’s article betrays what is
eithet his ignotance ot, incompre—
hension of, oi nagtant distegatd tot
fundamental Journalistic practices
and responsibilities. The review of
the Zirlde exhibition reﬂects badly
on Mr. Anderson, on the Scarlet St
Black, and, indeed, on Grinnell Col—
lege.

Gardner Parties Scheduled?

Deat Campus Community and
Sesquicentennial Committee:

The Interim Session Schedule
at the end ofthe December 5th Cam-
pus Memo includes a Gatdnet Patty
in Gatdnet Lounge on Wednesday,
January 10th and another event on
Saturday, lanuoty 20th. We, the
members of the Main Hall Council,
would like to express our anger that
we were bypassed in the scheduling
ofthese events. This year's Student
Handbookstatesthat“Parttesorgath—

student lounges are subiect to deci—
sions by residence hall COLInCilS.
Membersofthe MainHallStaffhave
twtce informed the Sesqulcentennir
alCommiitecofthls. Wefcel thatby
ignoting this, those who planned
these events have subverted the self,
governance residence life policies on
this campus, which ate supposed to
“promote respect for,i.COmnillni[Y
norms"(48)and“cncoutagestudents
to govern themselves in their living
envuonments" (49).

In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE’I’I‘NER

A {dead asked the tccently itl
were planning on attending Orin—
hell's sesquicentonnial Intetini Ses—
sion this winter. I answered him
with a vetyetnphatic “no." I have to
adniit, though, that the idea was
tempting. Cutting short my winter
httalt by two weelts to come back to
school and attend classes sounded
really nice I thought ofall the fun I
could have shivering in my dorm
tooin when I wasnt toasting in ARI—I.
I thought of the food in Quad. I
thought of the vast expanses oi uri—
plowed snow between Main and my
classrooms which would await me
almost every morning. I thought of
Ion-owintets—eventhoughl'ntttotti
Iowa Cityiund a shivet (ofexcite—
ment, no doubt) ran down my spine.

I pictuted two weeks pent up in
classroomswith instructors who were
actually excited about Grinnell‘s
Sesquicentennial. Would everyclass
handout be printed on light grey pat
pet with acute little “Grinnell 150"
logo on it? Sounds like a mile mark»
er.

I pondeted what tutthet useless
itettts the conitnitteecould come up
with to entieh out lives. to make out
experience ofGtinnell’s 150th yeat
all the tnote nietnotable, As ifSQC

that‘s a black inattet item nowiit
goes tot about $1.497though some
people ate selling used bottles that

Alas and alack, howetet, with
my 2,706 pagesothistoty niostly read,
