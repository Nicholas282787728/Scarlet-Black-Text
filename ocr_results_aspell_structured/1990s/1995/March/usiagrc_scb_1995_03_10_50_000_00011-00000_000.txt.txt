Men’s tennis team 3-2

after ﬁrst week of games

By CHRIS PALLAS
Sports Editor

HE Grinnell College Men’s

Tennis team is 3,2 after its

ﬁrst five games and the team
is apparently stronger than in previ-
ous years, according to Coach David
Arseneault.

“I feel like we're [50] because
we've performed to the best of our
ability," he said.

Last Thursday the team played
Cornell at home. The Pioneers won
8st.

Last Friday, the team played at
Coe againstboth Coe and the Univer-
sity of Northern Iowa. The men lost
both games 871, but still did well.
Arsenault noted.

He said that UNI is a Division I
team and Coe is one ofthe best tennis
schools in the region. Playing well
against both schools shows that the

team is much better than lastyear, he
said.

The Pioneers took on Simpson
College this last Tuesday and Central
College Wednesday. Gn'nnell won
both games 8-1.

Aresneault pointed to Pioneer
Sophmore Themios Cambas as a par-
ticularly bright star, Carahas helped
achieve a doubles Victory over Coe
and was the only Grinnellian to win
againstUN'I. He may alsobe playing
in three doubles matches later in the
season.

“He’s made extraordinary im~
provement since last year,”
Arseneault said.

Arseneault hopes that his team
will ﬁnish among the top three in the
conference.

“We can make up ground on
Lawrence and Knox, [although] Riporl
and Coe may beuntouchable,"he said.

Freeman complimented Baggs’
effort.

“Ellis is a ﬁghter. He gave every
ounce of effortdown to the ﬁnal meter,
Some of our other mnners need to use
him as an example," he said.

“This team is a fun group to
work with. They train hard and have

great focus. Wejust lacksome depth.
I look for us to be slightly stronger
during the outdoorseason." Freeman
concluded.

The Pioneers will be in a general
training phase for the next two weeks.
During spring break they will travel
to Texas where the team plans to
focus on conditioning and more tech-
nical aspects of their events.
