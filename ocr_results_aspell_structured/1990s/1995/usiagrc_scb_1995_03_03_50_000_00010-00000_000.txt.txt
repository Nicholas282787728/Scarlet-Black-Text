Can ’t Talk, Eating!

By JED ORTHJASON WOLF, MATI‘ HABER &]ON ROSE

RST of all. we hope the new

F SGA presidentwill support our

student initiative to get rid of

ﬁsh platter. We hate to beat a dead

horse, but there’s nothing wrong with

beating a dead fried fish. Look for our

student initiative in the post ofﬁce in
the near future.

Second of all. where the hell was
the crispy meatless party pannesan?
After all the hype surrounding it (due
to us, primarily), we couldn‘t wait to
bite into it While everyone else was
lining up for Tracy Chapman tickets,
we lined up for the crispy meatless
patty parmesan. Braving the cold and
the left over aroma of ﬁsh platter. we
waitedforseveralhouisgleefullywait-
ing in anticipation WHAT DID WE
GET? NOTHING! We wantanswers,
McConnell. We were more disapr
pointed than the 70lst person in line
for Tracy Chapman. The evening
wasn’t a total washout however. We
didmanagetogetsomeharvesiburgers.
Those things rock.

The crispy meatless patty
parmesan fiasco occured the day after
fish platter; talk about a true test of the
spirit! Tuesdaynightwe almoststarved
because every restaurant from here to
Iowa City was packed with Gnnnell
students in their hantit; attempts to
avoid thatdeep-fat fried s_t inCowles
and Quad. Fortunately. we still had
somechicken patty pan'nesanlcft over
in oursecret booty freezer. Who knows
why Jed felt compelled to Wear his bat
suit to dinner, but it most definitely
added to the atmosphere. Mart thinks
it has something to do with David
Hasselhoff but Jason and Jon don’t
want to hear his conspiracy theories.

This week there are three new
items being served instead of the
vaunted wok bait Monday. baked
scrod makes its ofﬁcial debut. Jon will
be eating banna cake and Hungarian
noodle bake with a chocolate shake
along with this meal, Jason will be
enjoying the chicken chimichangas
while Jed and Matt avoid him for the

rest ofthe evening,

Wednesday's dinner, breaded
clams.is conﬁrmation thotMcConnell
isincahootswiththefisliindustry. We
suspected (and now know) that he and
the infamous Captain Macallister of
the Frying Dutchman Eatery are in
control of the international ﬁsh syndir
cate. We’d give you more details, but
we are afraid that we would wind up
sleeping with the ﬁsh, Wouldn't itbe
ironic if we were to die surrounded by
future members of ﬁsh platter?

UK. we haveto stop writing about
fish. Jon isbreakingoutin hives andis
delirious. He's mumbling something
about how happy he is that people
other than his friends read his article.
That’s ridiculous because if you are
readingthis, then you are our friend. A
friend of food is a friend of oursl

Ifyou decide against the clams.
then you're stuckwith meatloaf. Last
time meatloaf was served, we re
vealed its dualistic qualities, If it’s
red on one side. turn it over and
you’ll see the dark side ofmcatloaf.
We can hear McConnell mumbling,
“Join the dark side. i am your true
father." Forget it Dave, we‘re not
Jollung forces with you and your
aquatic arena of crime.

One would be food critic labelled
meatloafwith gravy. “warmed-over
roadkill." You can see why that
student is not writing this article.
We provide more than just three
word metaphors. We give you the
truth! Some people can’t handle the
truth. They have audacity to ques-
tion our pursuit for the blanket of
freedom and good food in the dining
halls. We won'tsiand forthat. We’re
not going to give you the menu and
say “thank you and good night "
When we do that people lose lives
(especially on nights like fish plat~
ter). Did we order chicken patty
pannesan? YOU'RE GODDAMN
RIGHT WE DID, MCCONN'ELL!

We make no apologies for our
outbursts. We are food critics, We're

I haven’t heard Monica Horton’s

this is because no-one has kept us
informed about what’s going on. it
doesn‘t seem like [SGA] plays that
big of a part on campus.

two very different things

Furthcmiorc, interaction is prob
ably all thatis needed. We don’t need
a special African Studies Dcpanincnt
or a section of the library dedicated
just to black culture. We just need
opportunities to see other races and
traditions The SOL dance at Spanish
House and the CBS talent show are
cxcellentexamples of such opportuni-
ties. Creating these opportunities does
not require special housing or minor
ity»only events and organizations. It
just requires a willingness to teach and
be taught,

In conclusion. multiculturalism
is still a problem at Grinnell. but it is a
solvable one. First. we must create a

We should understand that it is not noes
cssary to educate everyone about all
cultures or even one culture. as long as
individuals receive enough exposure to

we must admit that no group is devoid of
the need forthat exposure. Claiming that
certain minoriu'es are exceptions to the
nile only causes the situation to degrade
into the white people versus minority X

about, Finally, we must accept that edu-
cation can be simple and uncomplicated,

As far as I can tell, [SGA is] not very
effective becausethe proposals [read
about in the minutes never happen.
