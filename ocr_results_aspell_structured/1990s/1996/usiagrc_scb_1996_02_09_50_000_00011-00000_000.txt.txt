”I was pretty pleased wirh out

“We still have a lot ofivork to do but

mittee W|ll likely be controlled by
Division I interests.

The executive committee is said
to be more objective and able to act
independently than prior manage—
ment groups, but with Division I

residents incontrol, moneywiil liker
y be the driving force behind deci«
sions. Presidents need to ensure the
economic stability of their schools.
Since television controls a large por,
tion of the money available and the
influence they wield is likely to con»
tinue to increase.

Pressure will mount for the Die
vision I schools to extend their sea—
son and add games abroad for more
money, Teams will likely became
even more competitive and s eclai»
iced. Division I schools w1 l drift
farther away from the true meaning
behind running programs torstudenr
athletes.

The new management commit—
tee Will only perpetuate this trend.
The management committee will be
structured so that each Division sets
their own rules. While this theoret—
ically may appear ro be an appropri—
aresepararion between the Divisions,
in reality this measure will continue
to reduce the academic and ethical
standards ofcollege athletics.

Division III schools like Grinr
neliwillbelosinga reatdealoftheir
operational eonrrn . currenrly, an
NCAA Convention meets once a
year in decide on rule chanaes for all
NCAA sports, tech schoo receives
one vote Under this former strilc«
tilte,“DivlsionIIIhasbeenabletobe
the conscience for Divtston I, voting
for limits on the number of games,
amount ofmoneyspent and coaches,
and in maintaining academic stan—

dards,“ Said Fairchild

Now though, Div ion I schools
will be free to set their own standards
without their little brothers and SIS<

rers to provide a moral conscience.
Although many Division III

schools opposed restructuring be»
cause oftheir loss ofpower and men—
ey. they were pressured to vote for
the changes because there was no
alternative. Accordin to Fairchild
“60 to 70 Division I so ools threat-
ened to pull out of the NCAA and
take all rho money if the restructur
mg was not passed.”

Div1sion III schools will contin~
tie to get the money they previously
received from the NCAA, but Divi-
sionIschools wilIkeep the new mon—
ey they generate. An example of this
is the eight vent, one billion dollar
contract for basketball that was re»
cently extended to $1,75 billion,
Under the new agreement, none of
this additional 750 million dollars
will be required to go ro Division II
and Ill schools,

While Division III schools did
receive an increase in the break up of
money, receiving 3.18 percent ofthe
Association's general operating rev—
enue as opposed to 2,83 percent un—
derrhe old agreement, with the addi—
tion of many NAIA colleges to the
tanks ofDivision [land III in comm
years, the actual funding per schoo
will cltop. The pa ularion of Divi»
sion III is expect: to double in the
next lew years from 387 to 774.
According to Dan Bridges, co—chair
ofthe NCAA Division III Task Force
onRestructtiring,thiswilllikelys lit
Division 111 into several sma let
groups

It will be interesting to see ex—
actly how the small schools reacr to
the Division I powerplay. I-Io efuIly,
college s orts programs, at sl levels,
will be a le to maintain, not to men—
tion improve, their levelof integrity.
Hopefully, the idea of student ath«
letes will be able to triumph over the
power of money that is increasingly
controlling Division I sports.
