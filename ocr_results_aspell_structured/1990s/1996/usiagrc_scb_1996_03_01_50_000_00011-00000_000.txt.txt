Window Locked From Outside

BY DAN BUE’ITNER

Hi. I’m Dan Buettner, your
friendly neighborhood newspaper
editor, The reason I am editor is
simple: I love Grinnell. Sort of,

March is upon us, and With it a
plethora of candidates for next year’s
Student Government Assouation
president and vice—president, many
ofthem promising the same things,
some promising nothing, and almost
all reciting their resumes for us.

Let us delve deeper into the mind
oiacandidatetorpresident. “Listen,
think and act" sound like a good
policy to pursue? Sounds more like a
guidelinefor,well,anything. ltmakes
me think orthe “stop, drop and roll"
procedure I learned in first grade in
case I ever caught on tire.

I would like to note that we do
not actually pay $22,000 to go here.
Thisyear,thecomprehensiveteewas
$21,410, and next year, according to
Pam, it will be $22,060, I think
having your facts and figures accu—
rate is pretty important, don't youl I
also think it would be an excellent
idea for Student Affairs to endorse
an albcampus progressive drinking
party, since only about oneethird of
this campus is old enough to drink
legally and, hey, who really cares if
the police get involved? I wouldn’t
mind afew expensive tickets forcon»
tributing to the delinquency of a
minor, or for having an open con—
tainer out ofdoors. Ifwhat we want
is to be able to walk around campus
en masse and underage with open
containers, we might as well just sign
a petition asking Student Affairs to
enforce a strict drug and alcohol pol.
icy.

Let me tell you that if your one
outstanding characteristic is wearing
shorts all the time, I see pneumonia
in your future,

Another thing I‘d like to point
out is that even ifl wanted SGA to
function as a lighthouse. it would
make a pretty poor one, given its
location in the Forum basement,
Perhaps relocating to the top floor of
Goodnow, or addingyet another floor
to Butling,wouldmakeariSGAhght—
house light up more than the Forum
parking lot. But SGA should defy
nitelybe more thanalonelysignalin
the expanse ofdarkseasfcomfields!)
and allspervading darkness (“the
horror, the horror")

Generic promises are another
good thing to make ifyou’re notsure
what to do. Suggesting more outlets
for students to tell SGA what they
want sounds good enough, as if the
VAX noteboard, e—mall, hall sena—
tors and weekly meetings were not
enough. Offeringto make a positive
contributionworks,too,sincenoone
will vote for you if you threaten to
make a negative one.

Seriously,though.Idoubtlcould
put together a candidacy for [ﬂash
dent on this campus without making
promises many of you would fine
inane at best. But then I'm not
running,

Speaking ofSGA, I read in my
trusty minutes this week that SDAE
got money to buy a pig costume.
They want to protest the fact that
people eat pork, and to do it in front
of Hy<Vee in town, I think someone
should gently remind them, perhaps
with aclub, that we are in the middle
ofthe hog capitol ofthe world. Demr
onstratingagainstporkconsumption
mfront of Hy—Vee inGrinnell, Iowa,
seems somehow analogous to Joseph
McCarthy deciding, in the I950s, to
take his rhetoric on the road. To
Moscow.

ans and vegans are encouraged to
contact me for inclusion in this legal
effort for restitution.

Our food does have a face ,.not
just the face of a cow being slaugh—
tered, but also the face ofa deity; the
face of a dead fish on the shore ofa
once healthy stream; the face of a
sand dune where there once was for—
est, the face ofa statvtng child.

Double Standard?
The SDAE “Pig Out" campaign

has been critic-ed from many an—
gles, including: an effect on (own—
gown relations. Is the idea to let
students do what they want as longas
they keep it confined to campusl
You can read yourSOA minutes from
2/21/96 and see that $175 was grants
ed toGEAR to bring a section ofthe
AIDS quill: to campus Was this
event intended to involve campus
onlyl

What the SGA minutes didn't
say is that GEAR was granted money
with the stipulation that the town be
notified and invited to participate in
the event Via the Grinnell Herald
Register (a piece ofinformation that
I doubt is going to cause a flood of
mailto the senators or editorregnﬂh
ing towngown relations). We have
taken the position of intellectually
superior guardians ofserenity in de«
ciding what types of controversial
information is acceptable for extra—
campus broadcast, We have made a
decision that it would probably be all
right to expose those culturally de—
prived, lesseducated, impressionable
folks in town to a display of AIDS
sympathy and education (in that or—
der), but not to a demonstration
against the meat industry. I have a
lingeringsuspicion that the approval
or disapproval of either budget had
less to do with our concern for town—
gown relations and more to do with
out using iowngown relations as a
smoke screen for ourown unwilling—
ness to be presented W|[l"l truly con—
troversial information AIDS, inspire
of being ‘hot,’ is not a controversial
issue in this envuonment; not is any-
thing human-rights related. The
causes are unquestionably supported
and funded. The budget proposals of
GEAR, Amnesty, and Students for a
Free Tibet were all approved that
evening and nowhere on campus
have I observed opposition to their
posted information campaigns, or
heardaboutoppositiontothese caus—
es. We choose to tolerate photos of
Tibetan Buddhist monks being beatr
en by Chinese soldiers, but rip down
a flyer with a photo ofa pig's face on
it! I’ve also seen an SGA senator
help table SDAEs funding proposal
and then avoid taking responsibility
for their intolerant behavior by hid»
ing behind the notion that they're
representing their constituents. My
senator (who was pro<SDAE ftlnd<
ing) had received only one letter
which happened to be in favor of
SDAE‘s proposal. But regardless of
whether or not a senator happens to
accurately represent a constituent is
a matter of coincidence, and using

We should take afterthe admin—

protest aimed at alternatives to sci—

students claimed that animal exper-

and that lowering their grades based
on their unwillingness to participate
in these labs would be against the
policy. You‘ll notice that the word

the student handbook in reference to

Opinions and Animal Suffering

Last week Brandi Petersen, who
was raised on a beefcattle farm, ex»
pressed her concern in a letter to the
S&B that an “SDAE representative”
had perpetrated some wrong against
herbysuggestingthateatinganimals
is a matter of ethics, rather than a
matter of“opinion.” I am undoubt»
edly the offending “representative."
First I want to apologize to Ms. Pe—
tersen ifI in any way insulted her
personally. I do not know you Ms.
Petersen and I do not wish to pre«
sume anything about your commit—
ment to living morally.

I do not wish to apologize, how—
ever, for SDAE's distribution of liter—
ature, our posters, or our advocacy of
vegetarian and vegan diets. Many
people have responded to the SDAE
campaign by saying things like “stop
trying to force your opinions on us,"
“stop being so militant with your
opinions," or “it’s my diet." These
responses miss the point ofour cam—
paign.

I want to say clearly that our
campaign is not about diet or about
any opinions myself or other individ
uals hold. Our campaign is about a
fact: the factofariimalsufferlng. It is
silly to denythat nnimnlssufferm the
process of being raised for slaughter.
The vast majority of animals killed
in this country are raised on factory
farms and their suffering is obvious
and immense. However, even on
smaller farms. where animals are
treated comparatively kindly, they
still suffer greatly. Animal suffeting,
even when it is not as extreme as it is
on factory farms, is still morally rele—
VanL We don't need to eat animals
or animal products and it would re.
duce animal suffering if we didn'ti
The real issue is notdiet or opinions,
but animal suffering.

I‘m glad to hear that your ﬁnk
mals are treated well Ms. Petersen;
beefcattle are often the best treated
offarm animals (though they are also
the least healthy and the most enVi<
ronmentally damaging) Here are
some questions for you.7 Are you

aware that 85% of US topsoil lost
from cropland, rangeland and forest
land is directly associated with rais-
ing livestock? Are you aware that
over 50% of all the water consumed
in the US is used to grow feed and
provide drinking water for cattle and
other livestock? Beef cattle routine—
ly have their ears cut or are branded
for purposes of identification; do you
find this acceptable? Beef cattle are
routinely de—horned and castrated
without anesthetic; do you find this
acceptable? If you don’t find these
last two practices acceptable, what
steps have you taken as a concerned
member of the farm community to
end them and how do you propose to
humanely control an uncastrated,
horned bull? I have been told by
numerous farmers that without de—
horning and castration, bulls are un«
manageable.

Finally, I wish to say that I do
not think that farmers are any more
responsible for farm animal abuse
than your average meat—eater. I was
a meat—eater for most of my life and I
considermyselfasresponsibleforfarm
animal abuseasanyoneelse. Myown
experiences here in rural Iowa, in
rural Illinois, and in niral California
have led me to believe that farmers
are often more ethically minded and
honest than the population at large.

DISCO FEST VII

To the campus community:

It‘s about time this campus de—
veloped an attitude. We were begin—
ning to worry that the only group
around herewith anyzealousnesswas
The MenWhoStuffTheirCrotches.
That worry was definitely put to rest
by the welbmeaning group of stu-
dents have formed the Students in
Defense of Animals and the Envi—
ronment (SDAE).

Their words opened our eyes. Is
it fair for us to exploit the mighty
cucumber by ﬂagrantly ducbtaping
itssucculentbodytoourfleshythighs?
The idea is appalling, Frankly, we
are reminded of the unbelievable
amount of abuse that Gulliver was
subjected to by the Lilliputians who
tied him down and mocked his eXist—
ence, or of the cruelty involved in
breaking the spirit of an Arabian
stallion Therefore, we cannot in
good faith continue to promote our—
selves as The Men Who Stuff Their

Crotches. The humiliation and pain
that the cucumbers are forced to en.
dure during the DISCO FEST is im—
mensegimagine spending an
evening taped to a hairy, sweaty,
(and probably ﬂabby) thigh as that
thigh takes part in series after series
of gyrations and thttuts designed to
highlight the prominence of the
crotch region. The honor is un—
speakable. From now on we would
like tobecalledTheStudents Against
the Horror Inﬂicted by Being Taped
to Someone’s Thigh.

Don't forget to have fun at DIS—
CO VII: THE POLYESTER
GROOVE.
