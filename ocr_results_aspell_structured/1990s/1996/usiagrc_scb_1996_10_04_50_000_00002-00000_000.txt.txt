heterosexual interactions, Falk em-
phasized that it is notjust a straight
text as it presents different forms
of the erotic, and does away with
traditional dominate/suborillate rer
lations prevalent in a lleterosexlst
View of sexuality. In the Song of
Songs one finds varied descriptions
of the physical beauty of the male
and female body; the mind‘nnd
spirit are presented in a highly none
dualistic, prerCartestian manner.
Dr. Falk explained her methodr
ology in translating from the He
brew. Not only did she want to
open up the text and interpret it.

 

 

Today at 4:15pm. in the
Forum South Lounge, there
will be a discussion by the
Lamas, a group of Tibetan
monks, about Human Rights
in Tibet. At 8pm. tonight,
they will be performing at
Herrick Chapel.

 

but she did not want to translate di-
rectly, She wanted to determine the
effects that the metaphors in the
poctry had on thcir original read—
ers, and recreate that effect in new
poems, maintaining the spirit and
language of the originals. She
noted that original translations ofr
ten don’t make sense in our present
culture context, Falk also explored
how our cultural contexts have led
to misleading translations, often
quite different from the original
Hebrew, which are then taken as
fact.

She has also translated Jewish

women’s poetry from the original
Hebrew and Yiddish. She ended
her discussion ofthe Song ofSongs
by relating the poetry of modern
Yiddish poet Martha Nussbaum,
from a collection entitled With
Teeth in the Eon/1.. (Nussbaum
will speak next Saturday, Oct. 12,
as part of the SQC Convocation.)
Dr. Falk sees this work as the mod-
ern hetr to the literary tradition of
the Song afSongs Wllh its connec»
tions to the natural world tied with
the spiritual world,

Dr. Falk‘s convocation lecture
dealt directly with her Jewish femi»
nist prayer book, published this
year in both Hebrew and English.

In the Jewish tradition, the
prayer book is the only sacred book
which can be changed; all other
sacred texts are closed to substan-
tial change. Dr. Falk focused on the

story of Hannah, in the first book '

of Samuel. as on re-‘
markable woman in the
Bible. She was an ordir
nary woman who could
not conceive and prayed
to God under her breath.

Accused of drinking
and babbling, she still
manages to defend her.
self. She is the first are
dinary person‘the rabbis
saw in the Bible as
speaking to God with
her own voxce, leading
them to establish temple
prayer.

In speaking through
her heart Hannah
changed the way Jews worshiped.
“Are we then.” Dr. Falk asked,
“following or breaking with tradi-
tion by changing the liturgy?"
According to Dr. Falk, the source

say,
are.

ofblessings is everywhere, but she
found an overwhelmingly patriar-
chal God in the traditional bless»
ings. she developed a liturgy
which was Comfortable for her, us-
ing new images ofdiVlnity, but al-
ways based on traditional sources.
Just as she reclaimed the Song of
Songs, so does she reclaim tradi-
tional Jewrsh blessings from those
for the home and synagogue for the
celebration ofthe Sabbath, to Rosh
Hodesh, a celebration of the full
moon, to blessings for everyday
life. Within her prayer book are
blessings mirroring traditional
blessings, songs, poetry, and com-
mentary presenting her scholarship
and reasoning behind these
changes.

Dr. Falk's most lauded Contribu-
tion to Jewish scholarship has been
in the creation ofan alternate opcnr
ing to_ most blessings, instead of

to be anything other
than him- or herself?

she offers “Let us bless the source
of life (the wellspring of life).“
This opening phrase became a for
mula foralternate prayer wordings.

Her major goal in rewriting liturgy
is to eliminate what she labels
“dead metaphors, overused images
of lnale privilege which have be.
come ingrained and meaningless.”
Her goal is to create lyric forms
with a greater presence of the sa-
cred, using images lo point to the
divinity which is everywhere, so
that no prayer becomes simply rour
tine.

Toward the end of convocation,
Dr. Falk spoke of her rewriting of
the traditional Kabbalat Shahbat
(Sabbath evening) blessings, in»
cluding the traditional Blessing of
Children, recited to children by
their parents. The traditional ver-
sion calls for sons to be like their
Biblical forefathers, and daughters
like their Biblical forelnotllers.

Falk finds this prescription too lll’n-
itcd

“Why ask for a child to be any
thing other than him or herself?“
she asked the audience. Her recs
reated blessing encourages the
child to “Be who you are," In say-
ing this blessmg, a parent performs
an affirmation for the child. and
fosters awareness oftlieir own cone
nection to the child. She discussed
her experiences in creating a tra-
dition in reciting this blessing to
her Own son. She described an ex-
perience recently in which her
seven year old son, after being
blessed by her on Friday night, re»
sponded : “Mommy, be who you
are." Falk said she related the story
because it felt “too Wonderful to
keep to myself,"

college did give $1500 to the policc
department to help them initiate the
bike program, the administration is
not interested iii increasing security
on campus. According to Crady, the
college desires a good relationship
with the town. and often gives money
for community improvements, such
as an extended ladder for the fire
truck

Currently, the bike patrol
operates from 6:00 pm. to 6:00 am.

During this time, the largest prob
lems the police encounter are open
residence hall doors, Occasionally.
the police also receive calls from stu-
dents complaining about other stu-
dents. Though the police are autho—
rized by statute to enter a residence
hall at any time, though not a private
room, the police tend to contact an
administrator before responding to
such calls, The police will respond
to any safety issues, but prefer to
leave issues such as noise to the cole

lege and the students,

“I think students were re-
lieved after listening to Bush," ex
plained Gates Hall Senator Nick
Lari-ha. “A lot of students have been
concerned that the police patrol
would infringe upon selﬁgovemance
, . . [However], all the police want
us to do is to act responsibly. What
we all need to remember is that actr
ing stupid brings the police onto
campus —— acting responsibly
doesn't." .

from among the items which the
middle man provides. Because the

‘ middle mall does not offer a broad

rangc of crueltyrrcc products, the
only way the bookstore could ensure
selling no nnimatrcsted products
would be to sell no products at all
Students do have a choice about
whattliey buy at the bookstore, how»
ever. As Wherry points out, the easi»
est way to have students buy antir

cruelty products is “to let the kids de»
cide." SDAE members Miriam Dean
and Maggie Taylor agreed. “This is
exactly what SDAE hopes to do by
offering the petition to the student
body, The pomtofthe petition is not
to convince students to to boycott the
bookstore, nor to make things difﬁ-
cult for the bookstore managers.
Rather, the group hopes that student
interest in cruelty-free products will
encourage the bookstore to seek out
alternative purchasing plans, at least
for personal care products."

SDAE will be petitioning for antie
cruelty products next week in the
post ofﬁce. By providing bookstore
managers with a list of students in»
terested in cruelty-free alternatives.
SDAE hopes that bookstore repre-
sentatives will be able to use the
document to persuade their purchas-
ers to offer cruelty-free products.

The group also plans a vegan bake
sale, notyet scheduled, to raise funds
to buy supplies for an animal shelter

said Dixon. An alternate plan,
though, which Dixon hopes will be
implemented in the near future, is
being established by GEAR. This
plan will provide transportation to
free testing sites in Iowa City and
Des Moines, The drivers will be un-
der conﬁdentiality and will possibly
even be trained in some counseling

skills so that they can provide supr -

port for the students being driven to
the sites.

Other testing alternatives are
available. One possible option, as
proposed by Mrs, Bailey, is to ask a

Construction, continued from 17.]

According to Adrienne van der
Valk ‘97, who lives on Main Street
in downtown Grinnell. the construc»
tion project may also be damaging
townrgown relations. “College stu-
dents do not have the most regular
ofsleeping schedules," said van der
Valk, noting that street construction
often begins as early as 6:30 am,
“We don’t have a Choice about when
we get up 'in the morning," she said.

van der Valk claims that the rea-
son that construction is allowed to
begin at 6:30 am, in the downtown
area is a result of the city‘s percep-
tion of downtown as a non-residen-
tial area. “I really don’t think that
this (early morning construction)
would happen on Country Club
Drive," said van der Valk.

The ways in which the City of
Gl‘innell’s nolse ordinances are inter-
preted supports van der Valk’s belief.
While resldents may loathe being
roused by sledgehamlllers, Mir-tam
Schultz of tile Grinllell Police De~
panmcnt says that business people
often welcome earlier daily starting

state or federal clinic to come into
town to conduct free testing once per
semester. Again, though, this possi—
bility brings up concerns ofconﬁden-
tiality among students, as well as
being a huge time commitment for
the clinic workers.

Dixon and Mrs. Bailey see no
Shortrterm solutions at this point.
“Part of the problem with HIV testr
ing," Mrs. Bailey said, “has to do
with educating people that this is a3
medical issue and not a social issue.
Maybe ifwe continue educating and
being aware, possibly the anony»
mous factor will not always be
needed in HIV testing."

times for construction. “Merchants
are a little concerned about business
being hampered and would prefer the
construction to begin before business
hours or after closing," said Ms.
Schultz. City noise regulations state
that construction workers must ad
here to “what's normal and reason
able" in deciding tlleir working
hours, which usually means waiting
until sunrise to begin work, But if
scheduling becomes difficult, busi»
ness transactions are interfered With,
and us the completion date of a
project nears, the city allows work-
ers to begin work before dawn,

In addition to the State Bank ad-
dition, the City of Grillnell has been
working on streetlight and sidewalk
projects between Fourth and Fifth
Avenue on Main Street, the north and
south sides of Fifth Avenue from
Main Street to Broad Street, and on
the east side of Broad Street from
Fouitli to Fifth Avenue. These
projecls have been taking place since
Mcmorlltl Day. The earliest pro-
jected finishing date is set for No-
vembcr.
