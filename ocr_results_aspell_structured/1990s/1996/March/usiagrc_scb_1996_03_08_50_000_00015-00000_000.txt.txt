The average Grinnell student
may be unaware of the fact that there
are several academic classes offered
at the Physical Education Complex.
Grinncll physical education faculty
reaeh courses that not only diseuss
the foundations of sports, but also
the psychological and societal issues
that arise in regard to athletics

There are several courses that
ate offered to students at the PEC.

inent. Students can take courses at
the PEG that range from general ac»
tiv1ty classes to courses that cover
sports theory While many of the
students who take these classes are
athletes or individuals interested in
pursuing sports related fields, other
students also take these courses in
the interest of learning about psy-
chology, sociology, and how they
relate to such a tclevant topic as
sport in our lives.

Professors Tim Hollihaugh and
David Arseneault emphasize that
what happens in athletics reﬂects ti
great deal about the issues that are

currently ofgreat importance in de»
hates about the nature ofoursociety.
For example, the issue of gender eq/
uity is focused upon in both Hollis
baugh and Arseneaulr's courses rer
speetively and emphasized as an im«
portant part of sport in our time.

students move on to careers in phys
