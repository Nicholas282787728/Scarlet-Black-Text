My secret life as a football player

Memories of a high school state championship game

BY ANDY WEIDNER
Sports Editor

Over Thanksgiving break I had a
chance to relive aportion ofmy high
school experience. For many of us
at Grinnell. now Well along the path
to “real life." the thought of high
school sends shivers down the spine.
Nasty hot lunches, pressure to con—
form in dress and thought, and pep
rallies are a few of high school’s fea
tures that I am more than happy to
forget. However, one thing that I‘ll
never forget took place during the fall
of my senior year. It's not a single
event per se, but rather an experience
that left an indelible mark on my
psyche. That was the year I kicked
for the football team.

I’ll admit that I was somewhat ofa
jock in high school. at least on pa
per. Numerous letters in four sports
can attest to that. However, I don’t
think people would have labeled me
as such then. I didn’t hang out with
other many other members of the
track and swim teams, much prefer—
ring my friends from hand and the
soccer team. I ran trzlck and swam
mostly to keep in shape in the seer
cer off-season. Soccer was and is the
sport that I love.

My soccer team was an anomaly
among high school teams. To give
you an idea of what we were like,
our pre-game cheer was “Old Gold“
in honor of that particular brand of
cigarettes and most of out players
were into tierdyc and headbands. I
think we won a total of eight games
during my high school tenure,

I did not play soccer for the glory
(which is pretty obvious considering
our record). Iplayed instead because
Ilovcd the sport and my friends who
played it. But I eventually began to
yearn for some glory and recognition
for my athletic accomplishments. I
decided to try out for the football
team in addition to playing soccer.

There is a history in Northfield,
MN, my home lown. ofrecruiting a
soccer player to do the kicking du-
ties for the football team. One ofmy
friends. our goalie my junior year,
had done it his senior year and I had
pretty much expected to fill his Spot
once he graduated, I talked to the
football coach, “Bubba” is his nick—
name, and arranged for a tryout, af-
ter which I was given the duties for
field goals and PAT's. This Will be
no problem. I thought I'll board {1
bus headed for the football field cvr
ery Friday night With the rest of the
football studs, kick a few balls
through upright posts and maybe
some of their stildlincss will rub all

'on me. This will provide me with
exactly the kind of attention I‘ve
been Craving. or so I thought.

A bit of Northfield Raider football
history: During my freshman year
our football team did not win a game.

.Tlie year after that I think they won
acouple. In 1992, the yearmy friend
was kicker, they made it pretty far in
the playoffs but unfortunately lost the
game which would have propelled
them to the state tournament on a
missed field goal in the Waning m0,

merits,

I knew that the team I would be
playing for was good and I ﬁgured
they would probably do Well in the
playoffs. Great, that would man even
more chances to boost my ago. Little
did i know: they were incredibly
good and had worked long and hard
to attain their level of play.

This jock was in for the ride of his
young life which would eventually
bring him back to where he had
started.

We went to the state championships
that year, the Prep Bowl as they call
it in Minnesota. It’s 21 day long, tele-
vised tribute to high school football
starting early in the morning withthe

 

never felt through sports before. I
realized out there on the Metrodome
ﬂoor that there was something in-
credibly empowering about being a
part ofa collective that was working
together toward greatness. It gave
me the feeling that I could do no
Wrong, but ifI did someone would
be there to cover my back. I decided
then that I was no longer in it for a
piece of the pie. I would do what I
had to do to win the pie for those who
had toiled long and hard to get us
here in the first place, And I would
be happy to receive any of the
crumbs that might fall my way.

We played hard that day till the end
but lost 21-I4 to a better team. We

9rmrin teams had won 12
from way up games, and
north. These ' undefeated
teams have [felt kmdafunny season, on the

schools, the
monsters of Minnesota high school
football. Northfield plays in classA
so we were slated to play the fourth
of five games.

For most of the players, this day is
the be-all endrall of their existence
as a football player, Sure, some of
them will go on to play in college,
but for most this is what it’s all about:
a high school state championship.

I felt kinda funny stepping out onto
the Astroturf that day wearing my
school’s football Jersey. Ihad always
dreamed ofklcking my Way to a state
championship but in an entirely dif-
ferent sport. But here I was, wearr

with 13 wins
under their
belts and a
state champi»
onship to boot.

' Maybe next year we said to those
who would get another chance.

Next year came and Northfield
went to the championship game
again. This time the clock ran out
before the quarterback could snap the
ball on what could have been the
Winning play,

Maybe next year.

Next year came and went with a
semifinal defeat at the hands of the
team we lost to my freshman year.

Maybe next year.

[went home for Thanksgiving ﬁrst
and foremost to see my family and
cat, but also to witness what I hoped
would be the Prep Bowl that would
end Northﬁeld football's agonizing
courtship with lady luck. This team
was heralded as the best yet to have
come out of NHS, These were the

 

freshmen who mostly looked on
from the sidelines when I played as
2| SEI‘IIOI’. '

This would be the last chance to tap
that magical energy that seemed to
come from our ‘93 ride to the Dome,
which was the ﬁrst time Northfield
hzld ever gone that far in football.
The freshmen turned seniors who
made up this year’s team were the
last who had been a part of that first
Prep Bowl. My hopes were ridliig
on them to fulfill the dream of a
championship I had held for my fel-
low football teammates,

The deal had finally come full
circle. Christian, a fellow “Old
Gold" soccerplayerwirh whomIofr
ten took the ﬁeld during my ﬁnal
season ofsoccer, was the kicker this
time around. He is probably the best
place kicker Northfield has ever
seen. He deserved to be where he
was much more than I, and yet 1 ant
almost certain that he felt much the
same Way that I did when I look the
ﬁeld three years earlier. He was dor
ing it for the team.

You can lose yourself in the most
pleasant way through team sports,
sacriftctng your individuality for the
collective. When good players shine
they bring glory to all those lnr
volved, I thillk that was why I enr
yoyed playing football so much for
the Northfield Rarders‘my senior
year ofhigh school. Ihelped oilters
to shine and they in turn helped. That
is the feeling the Pioneer basketball
players must have felt after Winning
the Midwest Conference crown last
winter. I think that was part of the
reason why Michael Jordan cried
when the Bulls Won their latest
championship. He knew he had been
apart ofsomething great, something
that doesn’t come around very often
and he had played for someone else
rather than himself.

In case you were wondering,
Northfield lost this time around too
Christian gave it his all but they were
defeated In the end, 7.3. My high'
school football experience has come
full circle now. And as far as I’m
concerned, it is over But that
doesn't matter because I‘ll always
have the memories,

mester against Knox and Illinois
College.

The Knox Prairie Fire arrive tonight

liois College is slated for a 1:30

to finish second
among south divir
sion learns.

Coe received the
nod to win the div
viston while the
Pioneers, Who are
the defending divi-
sion and league
champions, were
tabbed for third.
Illinois College, which has a new
head coach, received the ﬁfth posi»
lion in preseason polls.

“Both Knox and LC. are capable of
beating us, but if we play well we
should be able to withstand the test."
noted Arseneault “You have to Win
your home games if you want to

end is important,"

Last week the Pioneers were

Bryon Witzel '98 was the benefi-
Clary of Wilson’s shooting as he
racked up a game-high ninc assists.

He also tallied nine points and SIX

"Simpson is a great ball club. I
don't imagine they’ll lose many
games this season," remarked
Arserieault.

At Luther the two squads battled to
a 5463 Norse lead at half-time. It
was close for rest
of the game but
