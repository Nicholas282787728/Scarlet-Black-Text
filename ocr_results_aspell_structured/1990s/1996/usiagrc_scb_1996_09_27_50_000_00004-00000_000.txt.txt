Judaism at Grinnell, continued from page 2

students make an effort to go home
for the holidays. Some students from
Minneapolis and Chicago, for in-
stance, make a point of trying to at-
tend services with their families on
major holidays such as the recent
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipput or
Passover in the spring.

Some Grinnell students ﬁnd that
being Jewish in
Grinncll is emotione
ally difﬁcult. Being
a religious minority
both on campus and
in Iowa is hard for
many. Leaving
home communities
where many other
people were Jewish
adds to the distress
ofﬁnding oneselfin
a state with few
Jews and many in—
habitants com-
pletely unfamiliar
with Judaism. One
student said, “For
me, coming from an
observant Jewish
background, com-
ing to Grinnell and
being Jewish here is
one of the hardest
things I’ve ever had
to do. I don‘t know how to explain
it except that for me it sometimes
feels like a kind of grief? a loss of
something important made even
more difﬁcult by the fact that ‘orga»
nized religion’ is not something
looked well upon by many
Gtinnellians, and also by a Jewish
organization'that doesn't fit my
needs."

Another primary source ofanxi-
ety occurs for Jewish students when
class meetings and work coincide
with major holidays. The college
reminds faculty of the upcoming
holidays and requests accommoda-

“It is

You want to be the

tion for Jewish students, but many
students still experience difficulty
integrating worship needs with acar
demic demands. This last Rosh
Hashanah was a weekend-long holi-
day and many Jewish students found
that celebrating it put them far be-
hind in their coursework.

Many faculty members are ex

tremely accommodating of Jewish
holidays; for instance, Professor

Schrift's Philosophy 295 eiass'rneei- »

ing, originally scheduled for Yom
Kippur, was rescheduled so that the
Jewish students in class would not
miss crucial information. The Gen-
eral Psychology class, however, had
an exam scheduled for Yom Kippur.
While the professors of this course
were “very accommodating," ac-
cording to one student, in allowing
her to make-up the exam, the fact that
an exam was scheduled for one of
the more important Jewish holidays
seemed to this student indicative of

More flexible than ever.

the attitude she has encountered hcr
whole life regarding Jewrsh students.
“Academic institutions from cleiiieiir

tary schools to colleges often neglect ,

how important these holidays are for

some students. how hurtful it can be ,

to have your religion treated as an

inconvenience, and how annoyilig it '
is to ﬁnd exams or other obligations ‘

scheduled for a day you would likc
to spend, without a second thought,

‘with your family and friends."

One student remarked that the
university in her home town gives the
whole campus the day off for Yom
Kippur. She said, “While professors
here are very understanding about
letting us stay home and observe the
holidays, I still found it impossible
to observe the holiday as it should
be. on Yom Kippur, you are notsup-
posed to think about work; here II
becomes a necessity in order to keep
up with your classes. It is hard to
make the decision between proper
religious observance and studying to
get a good grade in class, and I think
it's shameful we should be put in
such a situation."

Some students are forgiving of
the college community in not always
meeting the diverse and multiple
needs ofJewish students on campus,
and were simply pleased that an or»
ganization and rabbi were available.
Others expressed disappointment in
the situation.

One student put it this way. “For
people who aren’t religious maybe
this is hard to understand but I think
it would be like having a twin who
you were very close to — who unr
detstood you, and fulﬁlled you, and
comforted you, and then just left.
And not only did you have to deal
with the leaving, you also had to deal
with everyone around you forgetting
her, or not knowing who or what she
was in the ﬁrst place,"

Technicolor Penguins:

 

 

 

 

By ERIN PETERSON

It was inevitable. The moment the
registrar closed last Friday (the last
day to add or drop classes without
excessive brutality on the partof stu»
dents and professors) many students
realized that they had 17 papersi
3756 pages of reading and two tests
on Monday, and thought to theme
selves, my GOD, what was I think
ing7!7 Well, okay, maybe that was
Just me,

Last spring, I thought I was ma-
ture enough to make independent
choices about my future, and that]
could choose interesting and mean
ingful classes. Of cotlrse, I was
wrong. Most gerbils could have cho»
sen classes more effectively than I
did.

Fortwo years, I had dutifully fol—
lowed the suggestions of the Vade
Mecum (Latin for“Silly Rabbit,Trix
are for kids), If it hadn‘t been for its
helpful guidance, 1 never would have
taken the most meaningful class of
my life, Chemistry is Everywhere.
(“Lookl Yellow and blue make
green! Isn’t the color spectrum fun?
We’ll have a test over this material

Drop while

on Monday") The ensuing humilia-
tion made me consider the merits of
mayoring in English more seriously.

This semester, I insisted on tak
ing a seminar, convmced that my
friends were only kidding when they
clnsstfied them as "death in 3 two
hour time slot,” Unfortunately, as in
the rest of my classes, my enthusir
asm has waned, leadtng to an end
less abyss of anguish, despair, and
homeless mountain go,
rillas. And that‘sjust the
good days.

I think it was
Aristotle who pro-
claimed the classes that
one takes for personal
enjoyment are actually
the ones that will end up
causingthemostcrankie
ness. For “fun“ I
thought I would take an ,
advanced poetry course.
despite the fact that my sole poetic
inﬂuence up until last year was Shel
Sllverslein. Even though the only
poetry I had ever written had been
odes to Front Loops and Lucky
Charms, I was pretty sure that they
constituted a spontaneous overﬂow
of powerful feelings. Unfortunately,
it took me a bit too long to discover
that I was entirely lacking in the
angst department, a prerequisite for
most poetry courses.

Perhaps the only good decision
I’ve made thus far was deciding to
drop math. I took linear algebra for
nearly three days this semester, un-
der the mistaken notion that math
was a concrete subject with actual
right answers, such as 12. As it turned
out, the “solutions“ often included
more letters than an epistolary novel.

you still can

I discovered that numbers were
vague and mystical concepts; much
like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monr
ster, discussed only in hushed tones
in secret math cults.

Instead, I took a more practical
class: art history. It is always enter-
taining to listen to passionate art
majors trying to convince the profes-
sor of an anist‘s conception of hu-
manity from a single brushstroke,

Perhaps the only good
decision I’ve made
thus far was deciding

to drop math.

(i.e. “As we can see from the use of
horizontal and Vertical lines, the art-
ist was obviously concerned about
the effect of Qrtips on the twentieth
century working class family." On
occasion, another student will point
out that this is unlikely, considering
that we are looking at a photograph
of the Parthenon.)

I suppose I shouldn’t be whining.
There are some people who are con-
vinced that their classes are the sole
reason that Gtinnell’s ranking
dropped two notches in U. S. News
and World Report. (I disagree, I think
they included the advent of bike po-
lice on campus in that ﬁgure as well.)
Besides, there‘s always next semes»
ter. If the Vade Mecum won‘t proA
vide any answers, I'm sure I can ﬁnd
a geibil somewhere on campus.
