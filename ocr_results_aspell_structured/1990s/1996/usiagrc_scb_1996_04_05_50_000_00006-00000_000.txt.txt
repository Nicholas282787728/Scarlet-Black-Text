Nuclear Proliferation, Part II
Putting the Genie Back in the Bottle

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

In the last issue, this section
focused on nuclearproliferation from
the perspective of the six Rosenfield
speakers, 5 of whom have US gov—
ernment and research instinltion ties.
This week, ldiscuss the aspects of the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
(NP’T) which, I think, warrant par—
ticular examination: articles 4 and 6.

Article 6 commits the have (nu—
clear weapons) states to achieve “the
cessation of the manufacture of nu—
clear weapons, the liquidation of all
theitexistmgstockpiles. and the elim—
ination from national arsenals of nu«
clear weapons and tlieir means of
delivery .." Article 4 establishes an
”inalienable right” of all have—not
states to develop nuclearenetgy.The
have states promise to help the have»

not states with development of this
technology

This feature will focus on: US
dedication to use of nuclear weapons
(violation oiArticle6);rhe question
of nuclear waste and contamination
(which will increase exponentially
as more states develop nuclear ener.
gy potential under article 4); and the
impossibility of delineating nuclear
energy purposes from nuclear war
purposes.

My basic point is this: Nuclear
weapons invite omnicide, and nu«
clear energy invrtes extinction. It is
unreasonable to produce weapons
which could eliminate life on the
planet; it is unreasonable to develop
and utilize resources which we can’t
contain.

I am convmced that posterity

will reﬂect on this period of history
with total incredulousness. The way
we now view slavery and cannibal-
ism ls how future generations will
view our addiction to Violence,
wlietlier war. carnivorousness, Caplr
tal punishment. or our collective
apathy regardingprisoners and those
in poverty. special incredulity will
be reserved for our policy ofdevelop»
lng weapons With a potential to wipe
our life on the planet and an energy
source which produces substances
which remain lethal for thousands of
years.

There are many organizations.
both nationally and internationally,
working to stop our nuclear addic—
tion. Please Email me or stop me on
campus if you want more lnformch
tion.

Nuclear Extinction and Article 4

Article 4 of the NPT, which
claims the “inalienable right" to nu—
clear technology, assumes that nu—
clear energy is a good and safe source
of power. Indeed, in the US, over
one-fifth of our electricity comes to
us thanks to fusion and fission. How-
ever, rational analysis indicates that
increasing world dependence on nu—
clear energy is a horrible mistake.
The development of nuclear energy
creates serious and enduring ecologr
ical and human welfare problems.
even beyond the possibility of ﬁcCl»

Nuclear Pollution

Nuclear Plants are messy. For
example, “Rocky Flats [Colorado, a
nuclear weapons facility managed by
Rockwell International] is a horror
show...Flutonium the size of my fist
wiped out Nagasaki. However, they
had so much plutonium lying around
that when they machined it, it got
hot. Plutonium is autocatalytic. it
will burst into flames You get what
atecalledplutoniumfires..,We'vehad
several maior plutonium fires over
Rocky Flats, meaning large quanti—
ties ofplutonium dioxide went into
the atmosphere over Denver...At the
Hanford reservation, there are sever»
al vats that are so radioactive that
tliey actually disintegrate organic
solvents, releasing hydrogen gas...lf
someone lights a match or turns on
an electric much, that hydrogen gas
could detonate X‘ Also at Hanford,
"they’ve liquefied the high—level
waste. The nignlevcl waste are its
way right tiirougli tiie metals. no
report stated that the Columbia Riv«
er may be the most radioactive river
on earth because of the hundreds of
millions ofgallons [ofnuclear waste]
stored at l-ianford" (LM). Indeed,
the health and environmental dam»
age which has already been done is
astronomicaly

Storage Nightmare

Even if we could manage nucle—
at energy and weapons “cleanly,"
what are we going to do with our
nuclear wastel “Every day. six more
tons of high—level radioactive waste
pile up at the nation’s 109 nuclear
power plants. it sits there in a sort of
atomic limbo, a total of some 30,000
tons of spent fuel rods so fat...And
there is nowhere for it to go" ( WP, )—
31.95). The DOE is studying the
possibility of storing the waste in
Yucca Mountain, at a proposed cost
of 33 billion dollars to build and fill.
Even iflt is approved, it will still be
far too small (77,000 ton capacity) to
hold the 101,000 tons of spent fuel
which will have built up by the time
it opens in 2033.

ButYuccamountainmaynotbe
approved, despite the fact that it is
theonlyoptionpresentlybeingstud-
led. “The dump must isolate radioac—
tlvity from the enVlronment not for
a few decades or even for a century,
butfor10,000yeats.. about twice the
span of recorded histoty" (WP).
There is also a possibility of earth»
quakes or volcanoes, and tlie roclt
below Yucca is very porous, which is
a problem “when [it is] packed with
radioactive canisters that will have
temperatures as high as 500 degrees
Fahrenheit" ( WP), and which “With—
in a few hundred years...wlll begin to
deteriorate and [release] their con-
tents... into the surrounding rock"
(WP). “You’ll have raw plutonium
and uranium which will be radioac-
tive for tens ofthousands to millions

of years being exposed to the envi—
ronment" (Lumpen Magazine, Janu.
my I 995). Even before the canisters
disintegrate. “when the cylinders are
filled, so mucri radiation will pene.
trate the steel that a person standing
next to one would accumulate a le—
thal dose in five minutes" (NYT, 3-
1336). As ifall this weren’t enough,
“the plutoniumcouldgo critical, and
you could have an atomic bomb dEF
onatelnside Yucca Mountain"(LM).
Also, Nevada’s Senator Bryan calls
Congress’ decision to focus only on
Yucca Mountain “nuclear tape." the
people of Nevada hate it, and the
land actually belongs to the Sites
hone Nation, which definitely
doesn’t want it.

'l'lius fat, “the Department of
Energy has spent 4.2 billion dollars
studying the issue, but there is no
definite solution in sight, and none
likely for years to come” (WP). And
what about other countries, as we
continuetoencourage“peaceful"iiu
clear technology? Where will they
store their waste? How responsible
will they be as costs mount or gov—
ernments changa liandsl

Conclusion

Until we have clear and well—
considered methods to deal with
nuclear waste, we shouldn’t be Great»
ing it. If the United States, with the
best scientists and the most money of
any nation in the world. can't solve
the problems of nuclear energy, it
seems clear that enlarging the use of
nuclearenergy is a myopic and tragic
mistake.

Removing the threat ofnuclear war is
the most acute and urgent task of the
present day. Humankind is faced with
a choice: We must halt the arms race
and proceed toward disarmament, or

face annihilation.

Nuclear Proliferation
and US Policy

The US seems singularly un-
concerned with issues of prolifera—
tion. as indicated by the fact that
we continue to help noncnucleat
nations develop nuclear weapons.
Also, the NPT enshrines a fallacy
which makes nuclearweaponspro—
liferation quite easy, if not inevita—
ble.

Dual use Boondoggle

The United States, in the in—
terest of commerce, actively one
courage: nuclear proliferation
through the promotion of “dual
use"goods,commoditieswhichcan
be used for both peaceful and nu«
clear weapons purposes, The us,
as pointed out by Randy Rydell
(oneof the Rosenfieltl speakets). is
“the world's largestsupplier ofdrial
use goods." The Commerce de—
parrmentdeniesfewerthan .l% (1
in 1000) oircoiiests forexport, and
that tone is falling under the guidr
once of Bill Clinton, The list of
Exports which don't require even
the mildest of commerce deparv
merit approvals is long and terrify»
ing. items which were Strictlycon»
trolled and sanctioned in the 19805
are now sold freely and easily. int
eluding krymns (nuclear weapon
triggers) and spin forming ma—
cinnes (to produce weapons grade
uranium), both of which ltaq had
beencaugnttryingtoolitaininthc
19805. Now they can buy as much
as they want of these and other
goodies.

Also, Bill Clinton intends to
eliminate all regulations regarding
ivliat can be sold to European
union nations. The key danger is
that EU nations might buy our
technology and sell it to the high
cst bidder. it is worth noting that
Germany and France are notorit

ously willing to sell nuclear (ech—
nology, weapons, etc. to anyone,
including Iran and lraq (NYT, 2«
2896).

Atoms for Peace?

The development of nuclear
energy (promised in Article 4 of the
NPT) encourages proliferation of
weapons. The French, Indian, ls—
raeli, Pakistani, Iraqi, and North
Korean nuclear weapons programs
all developed from nuclear energy
programs. As more and moreplutry
nium is produced by nuclear power
plants, proliferation becomes more
and more likely.

Terrorist or ”rogue nations"
might get nuclear weapons material
on the black market. “For$250 mil«
lion you can get access to the pluto—
nium necessary to get critical mass
and blow San Francisco or Los An«
geles right offtlie map. That is one
of the horrible byproducts of pro—
ducing so much nuclear material"
(LM) The fact is, however, that
promoting nucleatenetgythtoughr
out the world makes these concerns
superﬂuous, because “commercial
nuclear power plants can be con-
verted to weapons plants" (LM).
That is, any nation wlitcli has nu.
clear power plants can develop nu«
clear weapons

Conclusion

The NI’T’s inclusion of an “iiis
alienable right" to nuclear technolr
ogy is a fatal (law. Also, tiie United
states isn't lieipiiig any iii the effort
to keep our world safe iroin nuclear
proliferation. Again, it is clear tliat
the only rational solution is strict
controlsonExistingnuclearmnteti-
als and elimination, as quickly as
possible, of all nuclear technology.
