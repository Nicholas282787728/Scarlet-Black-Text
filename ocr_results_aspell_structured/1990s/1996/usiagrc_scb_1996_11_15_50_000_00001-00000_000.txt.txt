Astronomer explores
universe in lectures

Astronomer Virginia Trimble will speak twice at
Grinnell College, about cosmology and about the na»

ture of dark mattcr, on November 18 and 19. Trimble‘s
lectures are sponsored by the Harlow Shaplcy Visiting

Lectureship series.

Her first lecture, “Cosmology: Man's Place in the
Universe," will be at 8 pm. Monday, Nov. 18, in the
South Lounge of the Forum. Trimble’s second lecture,
“The Universe You Don't See: Existence and Nature of
Dark Matter," wlll be at 11 am. Tuesday, Nov. 19, in
Room 1023 in the Bowen Hall of Science. Both lec-
tures are free, and the public is invited to attend.

Trimble’s work has spanned 2i wide range including
investigations of gravitational radiation and studies of
the many peculiar stages that stars pass through as they
die. She is also well known as a writer who can distill
and present volumes ofscientiﬁc information with clar-
ity and wit.

In her first lecture, Tumble will explore the implica-
tions of humans in the universe and their ability to ask
questions about its and their existence.

“Life on earth is the culmination of a long series of
stages, from the Big Bang that started off the expansion
of the universe through the formation of galaxies, stars
and planets, to the emergence and evolution of life,
Changing even one of the fundamental constants of phys-
ics or cosmology would prevent one or more of those
vital stages from happening. Thus, the very fact that we
are here to observe the universe and ask questions about
it guarantees that the universe must be more or less the
way it is," Trimble said,

During her second lecture, Trimble will talk about
the makeup of dark matter.

The Harlow Shapley Visiting Lectureships are named
for astronomer Harlow Shapley, who was president of
the American Astronomical Society (1943-1946) and an

also played a major role in founding UNESCO (the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization).

Christian Fellowship leader steps down

Student resigns position due to the Bible’s views on homosexuality

BY ANDY BROOKS
AND DANYA LEEiiAw

According to the leaders of InterVarsrty
Christian Fellowship, in recent weeks one
leader has chosen to resign her leadership
position as her views on homosexuality
are in conflict with the doctrinal basts of
the national organization. This student ,
name withheld, supposedly does not be

garding homosexuality and InterVarsily
Christian Fellowship requires that its lead-
ers believe in the unquestioned authority
of the Scriptures in all cases 7 including
in regard to homosexuality. Upon learn-
ing of the student's resignation and the
alleged reasons behind it, a number of stu-
dents outside the organization have raised
questions as to whether or not this require;
ment violates Grinnell College’s nondis
crimination policy,

InterVarsity Christian Fellowship re
quires its leaders to sign a Statement of
Agreement by which they assert, among
other things, their belief in “the unique

Divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness
and authority of the Bible." The State-

ment of Agreement does not explicitly
denounce homosexuality, Yet according
to Kari Miller, class of ‘96 and member
oflnterVarsity, there are 9 passages in the
Bible that refer to homosexuality in It

encourages

environmental awareness

BY ERIC BAKER
Reporter

President Ferguson has responded to
calls from the college Community for a
more environmentally responsible cam-
pus by supporting the creation of the Eco-
Campus Committee.

The committee will publicize environ—
mental efforts the college is already sup-
porting and serve as a sounding board for
projects that the community may need.

Although there are a number of envir
ronmental programs already on campus,
there has often been difficulty in commu-
nication between these programs. Eco-
Campus Committee plans to increase
communication and coordination between
these programs, The committee, still in
its early stages, has tentatively set meeta
ings for every two weeks.

Current members of the contmittee inc
elude faculty, administration and students:
Professor of Biology David Campbell,
Vice-President and Dean for Student Af—
fairs Tom Crady, Professor of Biology
Lenore Durkee, Coordinator of Commu-
nity SerVice Amy Eilert, Director of Fa»
cilities Management Mark Godar, Direc-
tor of Dining Services Dave McConnell,
Professor of Anthropology John
Whittaker, Laurie Dick ‘97, Barbara Sloss

‘99, and Ben Stallings ‘98, It is still in
need of two or three student members.

Members of the Committee will direct
environmental concerns to specific orga
nizations or leaders who are the agents of
change. One such leader, Ms.Eilert is in
charge of “coordinating end of the year
needs, taking junk to the landfill, and
making sure Whatever is reusable is
saved.” Another is Mr. McConnell, who
is trying to cut down on food waste by
implementing new preparation and deliv-
ery methods.

When Ben Stallings noticed that “hall
maids were putting loggia posters in the
garbage instead ofthe recycling bins" he
realized that these workers were not aware
of the recycling bins, Stallings knew to
contact the EcorCampus Committee to ﬁx
this error in communication .

As a beginning to the committee‘s
work, they have developed a central file
of reports and publications, encouraged
relevant classes to encourage student
projects that are environmentally sound,
and held an open forum on October 31 to
get some feedback on what concerns stuc
dents have about the environment. Com
mittee meetings are not open to the pub
lie, but the committee plans on having an
open forum to hear student concerns eve
ery semester.

 

Miller asserted that members of
lnterVarsity are not required to take a
stand against homosexuality and that there
are homosexual members of the organi-
zation Members oflhe Grinnell chapter
are not united on the issue of homosexu-

ality and are not asked to be, according to
Miller and Chris Pallas, ‘96, Pallas, an
official leader of the group, explained his
stance: “The most important'thing is for
people to come to know God, not go

New pamphlet addresses
campus multiculturalism

BY KATE KLEINWORTH
Staff Writer

In the midst of campus controversies
over space for multicultural groups such
as ASIA, SOL, Chalutzim, and ISO,
Shereen Ali ‘97 has just published a palm
phlet detailing the history of Grinnell's
positive efforts towards achieving
multiculturalism.

The pamphlet, “A Multicultural Re-
view of Grinnell College," describes the
history of the various multicultural
groups, from the firstAfrican-American
students admitted in the 1860’s to the
1995 demonstrations against racial tenr
sions. Ali chronicles the formation and
history of organizations such as Cour
cerned Black Students (CBS) and Asian
Students in Alliance (ASIA), and turning
points such as the takeover churling by
CBS, There are also several essays by
current and former students on their perv
spectives of multiculturalism, and inter-
views with alumni who witnessed and
participated in some of the important
events. The pamphlet is free and is avail-
able in the bookstore.

Ali began work on this review, part of
the Sesquicentennial Celebration, in the
spring of 1995. After looking at a list of

projects for the Sesquicentennial, she no,
ticed something was missing.

"I was reading a list of projects and I
was surprised there was nothing being
done for this topic," Ali said. “It was an
amazing oversight. We had just had the
demonstration in 1995, the ‘Speak Out’
and ‘Speak Easy,” so I thought
multiculturalism needed to be recognized."

Ali began work on the pamphlet that
spring, and spent the summer here re-
searching, interviewing and Writing. Us-
ing records from student organizations, the
alumni office, and old yearbooks and
S&B‘s in the archives, she was able to lo
care many alumni. One difﬁculty was that
up until 1980, students were classified as
either white or black, making it hard to find
students from backgrounds other than
these, In addition, she soon ran into prob
lems interviewing some of them.

“I started off rather optimistic,"Ali said.
“But one thing that was rather interesting
was that a large number of people didn’t
want to be interviewed. They didn't want
to be singled out as a 'hyphen‘ . like an
Asian-American or an AfricanrAmerican.
They wanted to just be an American. Some
of them were really angry and pissed off
that they had been on alist as ‘other.'They

SGA faces increasingly materlialistic requests
Senator advises students to consider other options in seeking funds

BY DAVID BURNETT
Staff Writer

As the Student Government Associa»
tion has had continued success in satisfy-
mg the needs ofthe student body, Grinnell
students have increasingly turned more
towards SGA as a method of improving
student life

While these increased requests and
demands are being addressed by SGA,
some students have voiced the opinion
that SGA is being used too often for unr
necessary concerns,

SGA President Rupin Thakkar ‘97
said, “I do not believe that a greater num-
ber of concerns exisrs this year than in
the past, Rather, i believe that more stu-
dents choose to voice their concerns to
SGA." As more students take advantage
of SGA's collective power, the College is
better able to understand and address the
needs and desires of its students.

David Axtell, an SGA Senator, said,
“People should remember that the admin-
isiraticn has a vested interest in keeping
the students happy " SGA is helping the
administration focus on the concerns

which are important to the students,

Many students at Grinnell believe that
as more concerns are voiced to SGA,
more .mpruvcmonts will be made on came
pus Karim Manson, the SGA Social Co
ordinator, said, “To an extent, expressing
dissatisfaction is good in that dissatisfac»
lion leads to progress, winch leads to posi-
tive etiang " SGA can usc its power to
have a positive impact on Grinnell Coir
legc As more tinpicvcments are made,
the College community becomes a better
learning citvitonment, and conceivably.
the overall student satisfaction with
Grinnell would increase

Although using SGA as a means of
ltnprovtng Grinnell has some deﬁnite ben-
efits, some students believe that too many
trivial and materialistic concerns are be-
ing addressed

By addressing tssucs that are very imr
portunt to some students, but which are
trivial to most, SGA hits to take time away
from focusing on the concerns that affect
the ltt£tjority oflhe campus. Some of the
concerns that (in: brought to SGA could
be better handled by other Grinnell orga»
nizations. Mattson said, “Many concerns

are being brought to SGA which could be
solved by individual students, hall coun-
oils, or student groups If students knew
the proper procedures or the correct steps
to take."

According to Axtell, before a student
approaches SGA he should find out what
is the best organization to accomplish
what is desired, He said, “Just think about
who can better serve you — SGA or
someone else. If the answer is someone
else, tliclt you Should talk to them ﬁrst."
If students feel that other organizations
are failing to address their concerns, then
the students should take their concerns to
SGA.

SGA is currently working on ways to
help the campus address as many Student
concerns as possible. It has discussed crer
hung a list ofSGA associated committees,
so students would know exactly who they
would need to approach about having spe
cific concerns addressed. Another idea
that has been discussed would be for SGA
to publicly announce its officral view
about certain issues. SGA would then hold
forums in whichstudents could voicetheir
opinions about the issue. These would be

similar to the forum that was held in order
to discuss the GUM advertisement contro»
versy,

Currently. SSA commonly encounters
the difficult situation of trying to address
as many concerns as it can The problem
arises because SGA is often unsure about
how many students share the same con
cerns. SGA Senator Amy Cooper said, “I
think that there needs to be some type of
polling process to decide how many people
really do favor certatn items, and how
strongly they feel on needing them." As
of now, SGA determines the concerns that
it pursues by evaluating the number of stun
dent responses that senators receive about
each individual issue.

SGA wants to continue working with
the student body to improve the quality of
Grinnell, Even if an issue seems trivial or
materialistic, SGA is willing to address the
concern.

Axtell said, “Think about your con
cerns, voice them to the proper people, and
then follow up on them to make sure some-
thing is donc If you have something to
say, tell your SGA senator. We‘ll do our
best to get it done ifthc campus wants it."
