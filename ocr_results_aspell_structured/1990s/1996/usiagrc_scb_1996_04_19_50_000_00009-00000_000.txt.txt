nonetheless by the realization that
the TV show I once turned to solely
for the car chases and clever usage of

it’s a bit ofa stretch to expect Daisy

iMOImndES K. Gandhi

Basically, I think, Gandhi Capt
tures the basis of all morality in this
analogy. All morality distills to the
golden rule: "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you,” The
problem is that we don’t apply this
rule WIdely enough, That is. most of
us attempt to live respectfully ofothr

the many pcople we've never met. I
spend a lot ottime talking about the
international scene. and i believe

(which is artiﬁcially high according
to neoclassical theory), Is this OK
with you!

People in the military aren't
there, by and large, because they want
to be trained to kill and maim other
people. Prison guards are not swingt
ing those keys. generally, because
they enioy locking up their sisters
and brothers in the human family.
They are there, as so many of my

Gandhi makes acrucial point in
the above quoiation, We are called

to look upon the whole world as our

golden rule) as ourself,

mind, I do. I can rationalize it, even
as people starve and die. Make no
mistake, I could give my money to
Oxfam, Amnesty, Bread for the
World, etc. lfl choose instead to buy
an ice cream cone, that's fine, but I
should be aware of what I’m choos—
mg.

Clearly, none of us can be per.
fect. We all Violate the golden rule
every day. We are all in some mea.
sure complicit in violence—war, axe
ploitation, starvation—both by acts
of commission and by acts of omis<

eschew awareness orour complicity.
