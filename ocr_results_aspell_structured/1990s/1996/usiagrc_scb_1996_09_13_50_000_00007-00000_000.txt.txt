The DOD Accounting System

Friedrich recounts several payment horror stories from the Washington Post that are all too real, Unfortunately, what
Friedrich does not tell the reader is why the DoD is so error-prone. The Department's accounting system is horribly
antiquated, Much of the automated information infrastructure that the Department relies on to conduct business rests
on 19605 and 19705 (at best) technology. Why not capitalize and improve the accounting system‘? Good question.
Would you like to start a collection'.7 The DoD is in a Catchr22 with respect to these systems. Either the Department
invests signiﬁcant uprfront money (which. as we have seen from the budget ﬁgures above, is not easy to come by) to
recapitalize its aging auto~
mated information systems
or it patches outdated sys»
tems and continues to come

Entitlements Spending as a Percentage of All Federal Outlays:

 

lines. Not a pretty picture.

The problemis not too much

money in the system. rather

the problem is too little

money to upgrade and mode
' emize the system.

Defense Spending
Forces Domstic Policy Re-
structuring

Friedrich has this backwards.
The dizzying growth in non»
discretionary entitlements
spending drives all other fed
eral budget decisions. Discretionary spending (of which Defense is a part), is steadily dwindling under the pressure of
entitlements spending. Discretionary spending now accounts for less than 30% of the federal budget. Further, the biggest
winner in the annual distribution of fedeml largess is the middle class. not the plutocrats. Programs such as Social Security
and Medicare are largely middle class entitlements. Plutocrats are not the majority of the electorate. Plutocrats do not make
up the swing vote that often determines an election‘ s outcome. The middle class holds the cards in our democracy and our
national spending priorities reﬂect this fact. 11', as I assume, Friedrich is serious about representing the afﬂicted and freeing up
resources for the programs of social uplift, he should train his analytical skills on the New Deal and Great Society spending
legacies that, when combined with rapidly changing demographics, drive our nation deeper into debt every year.

As a fellow member of post-Baby Boom generation, I would expect Friedrich to be aware of the tremendous burden that
entitlement spending places on today ’5 young people, Take, for example, the regressive 15.3% tax (this includes both
employee and employer payroll taxes for the first $60,000 of income) that finances the Social Security systemJ‘his tax is
ﬂatter than Nebraska and allows for n_o deductions. Further, this tax ﬁnances the Social Security system’s current operations,
with the remainder going into a surplus fund. But instead of salung this surplus away for current contributors, the govern-
ment ‘borrows’ the surplus to fund cunent year federal programs. The bottom line is that without a fundamental change in
the entitlements system, the federal government is in danger of becoming nothing more than an ATM for the aging Baby
Boom generation.

"A of All Federal Outlays

Radically Chic Take Heart 4

I hope my contribution to die ongoing dialogue that is Grinnell College sparks some true debate, especially given that we

are in an election year. Apiece like Friedrich’s May 3rd column is a good starting point to engage in a reasoned discussion

about our national spending priorities. But it is only a good starting point if the argument isjoined by those with opposing
views. Consider the argumentjoined.

One of Grinnell’s strongest assets during my
three years here has been its social selfrgover-
nance policy, which means that students have
been responsible for their own behaVior. Ale
lowing police bicycle patrols on the walkways
and in the loggias marks a fundamental change
in that policy, and has made a number of stu-
dents both uncomformble and angry, myself in-
cluded. I feel that our space and our privacy
have been gravely intruded upon.

College administrators have stated both that
they want to have additional security around the
construction zones. and Uiat they do not intend
to use the police as a security force. Which is
true? The College has hired a private security
company to watch over construction areas,
meaning that police patrols are not necessary. I
have personally seen oﬂ'icers riding up and down
the South Campus loggia. The President's Fund
donated $1,500 to the Grinnell Police Depart-
ment to aid in purchasing a bicycle. The first
two spell ‘securiry‘ to me, and the last amounts
to nothing less than a direct endorsement of us-
ing the GPD’as a security force.

The hope is that the bike patrols will deter ha-
rassment of, and assauls on, students. as well
as decrease bicycle thefts. [do not believe, first
of all, that these patrols will be very effective,
or — more irriponantly — that any possible benr
efits make up for the intrusion on our space. If
you are worried about your bike, investing $25
in a good lock or putting it in your room will
keep it more secure than an occasional police
patrol. The same principle applies to walking
around late at night: if you are worried, call the
EscortService or askafriend to accompany you.
Two or three people walking together is much
more of a deterrent to harassment than the
knowledge that there’s a cop on a bike some-
where in town.

Having police patrolling the campus is indeed
an intrusion on our space. One of my favorite
things to do after a hard week of classes used to
be having a beer while sitting out on the South
Campus loggia, visiting with friends I won’t
be doing that anymore feven though I am old
enough to purchase alcohol legally, the possi»
bility of being harassed and ticketed for having
an open container outdoors is enough to deter
me. Iarn not the only one who may be affected
by this. either. What happens when the GPD
rides by Cleveland and smells marijuana smoke?
What happens next time you are‘s‘itting on the

loggia on a Friday night with a drink in your
hands? What happens if you‘re playing as-
sassin late some night anda GPD officerarmed
with a billy club, mace and a handgun gets
nervous? This may sound extreme, or at the
very least silly, but accidental shootings hap-
pen all the time. Consider also what the next
logical step after allowing Ioggia patrols would -
be: will we have armed police officers walk-
ing through our dormitories — for whatever
reason a before too long? This, too, may: ,
sound silly. but infractions of rights always
happen incrementally. .
Some people will point out that having an‘ .
open container outdoors is, in point of fact, .
illegal, as is marijuana use, and that the police -
would simply beenforcing the law ifthey were 1
to crack down on such activities. As I noted '
earlier, however, students at Grinnell are er-‘ 1
pected to be responsible for themselves. it‘s“
called ‘selfrgovcmance,’ and it works remark?
ably well. There are a number of very effec:
tive avenues by which social problems can be
resolved at Grinnell without having the police 1
watch over us. ' ‘
You will hear mat enforcing Open container;
laws and harassing students IS not what the‘ '
GPD is on campus for: ‘public safety’ is what.
you Will hear. Quite honestly. I am sure that is
true — in pnncipleg and Ido appreciate that.
security on campus is aconcem for many stu-’
dents. However, I am also sure that what is‘
enforced by the police varies greatly: it de-V
pends on the officer, on whether he has had a.
good day or a bad day and on whether he ap-
proves of your haircut and the way you are
dressed. I don’t want to be stopped on cam-;
pus at 3 am, questioned and asked for identi»_
ﬁcation. I don't want to be harassed because. ,
the GPD might not approve of the way my,
friends and I look, and I never used to worry "
about it. I do now, though, and I hope I am‘ j
not the only one. .;
I urge the Student Government Association
to reconsider its simplistic endorsement of die ‘
bicycle patrols as “a good thing," andI urge, ,
the administration to reconsider their decision; ‘
to allow bicycle patrols on campus. A police ,
presence on campus is both disconcerting and j
a profound invasion of what little privacy we ,
have as students here. ‘
