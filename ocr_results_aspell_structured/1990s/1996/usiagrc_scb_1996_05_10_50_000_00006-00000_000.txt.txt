Jailed? For Peace?

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH
So many people have asked me about my jail experiences.
People think I’m peculiar when I tell them I have spent more
than 22 months in jail for peace and justice. They think thatl
am totally crazy when I say that I believe I will be doing more
jail time in the future for my opposition to weapons and war
making. I recommend Swords Into Plowsfiares for people who

want to explore this issue in greater depth. You can order this
book from Rose Hill Publishers (l—80043I’EACE).

For now, let me just say that I think that the global situation
is quite dire, and that “normal” channels of inﬂuence do not
recognize just how bad things are. So many people are starvmg
to death; so many people are dying at the hands of US weapons
ry. I could go on and on, inundating you with statistics and
analysis, but I won’t. If you’re interested, please e—mail me.

I have dedicated the last six years of my life to saying “No"
to injustice and killing, and I hope to dedicate the rest ofmy life
to the same pursuit. When I am in jail, I try to be a peace—filled
presence, a voice of reason and a sympathetic ear for the many
depressed men who have few people willing to listen. I try to
make myself useful, writing letters for people, tutoring or
teaching, and simply being present for people.

Ihave been happy with the past 6 years ofmy life, and Ihope
to be doing prophetic resistance against war and economic
injustice for the rest ofmy life. However, I would be lying ifI said
it was easy or fun (it is sometimes, btit not always or even
usually). I don’t know that I have the stamina to do this for my
whole life, but some wonderful people have, so perhaps I will be
able to as well. In any event, I truly can't imagine a better way
to spend a lifetime.

East Timor is the eastern half
of the island of Timor, which lies
300 miles north ofAusttalia. It was
a Portuguese colony from the 17th
century until 1974, but after the
overthrow of the fascist Caetnno
regime in Portugal, a process of
decolonization began. OnNovem—
ber 28th,1975,ni’tet ashort period

clared Fretilin, by the party with

on December 7, Indonesian forces
invaded. Few images or words

it is clear now that the west knew

Please help us. ." But the cries from
E. Trmor were ignored.
