man ‘96. is a “kick »a*s“ string band.
Irs repertoire includes pieces ranging
from Cajun to Scandinavian as well
as a list ofinstriiments including fid—
dles, banjos, and an accordion “We

The Pluckers, who held their

rirsrdanee inLoose Lounge oneweek
before spring break, got together at
the beginning of this semester to fill
a gap in the Grinnell College social
scene. The dance in March featured
square dancing, linedancing, polkas,
waltzes , schottisches and two<steps
to the energetic live music of the
Pluckers. Accord ing to Kemperman,
“there hasn't been a scene like this
on campus, and we thought it would
be cool to do." The dance ivas well
attended and a number of people
who were there said that they en,
joyed it immensely.

of the performers to portray signifi—
cance in the action. “It really calls
on their resources,” says Moffett.
“This is made of imagination and
creatrvrty.”

Erin Griffith ‘97 explains
that she feels more confident with
each rehearsal because they are be»

Elements of Grinnell Col—

recalling student, alumni and
faculty memories. The student
performers researched imr

from the College‘s past, and will in—

nal focus was Grinnell history, over-
time the students found other ideas
they wanted to explore.

Rehearsals emphasize that the
players become comfortable with
each other and on the set. Their
movements are gymnastic; physical
interaction is very important. Jan
Czechowslti, professor of theatre,
designed an intricate j ungle—gym sys—
tem of metal scaffolds from which
the performers climb and leap.

The unique performance Will
also offer multiple perspectives and
numerous areas of action simulta—

be similar to a three/ring circus.
