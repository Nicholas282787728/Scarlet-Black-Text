After years of Jewish day school,

stuff, While I realm that Holocaust
denial is gripping the nation, I resent
that such a large pan of Jewish lire
today revolves around that disgust»
ing event in world history. I am
frustrated that modern American
Judaism places an inordinate amount
of focus on Zionism (a rather dis-
tasteful preoccupation) and anti—
Semitism (with the Holocaust as es—
sential to both issues) while largely
ignoringspirittialityisstiesand brood»

16. Yom HaShoah (or Holocaust
Renternheranee Day) 1 have spent
years questioning my feelings about
the (lay. Throughout my youth, ev—
erytime World war ll, Nazis and
concentration camps were men»
tioned, which was quite often, the
message was: “We must never forget
such suffering and eyil, and must
never let it happen again." The first
part of that message was pounded
into my head year after year, but it
tended to eerily obstruct the second

part. When discussing Injustices in
need of action by Jews who remain

a period to focus on violence in the

us to act against persisting initistices

My new, proactive approach to

“A Time to Break Silence,” reprint

demanded an end to the continued
suffering in Vietnam. “A true revo«
