Gotera seeks to enrich Grinnell by .
increasing multi-cultural awareness

continued from page 1

1980’s, he was the first person
there to begin Asian American
studies. “i hope my presence here
will have a similar effect in galva-
nizing the college by having more
courses in multircultural subjects,"
he said.

Last year, the Asian American
Student Alliance demonstrated
against the lack of Asian Ameri-
can professors and courses at
Grinnell. The English Department
and the MinorityrScholars—ln-
Residence had already been plan-

ning to bring Mr. Gotera to cam-
pus at this point. However, Assor
ciate Professor of English and
American Studies George Barlow
said, “I have personally benefited
from the discussions I’ve had with
individual Asian American stu-
dents and other students concern-
ing this topic. I appreciate their
outspoken commitment to increas-
ing course offerings in Asian
American and in adding faculty of
color, particularly Asian American
faculty. I would like to see Asian
American literature and culture
courses become a permanent part

of Grinnell’s curriculum."

Caroline Chon, President of
the Asian American Student Alli-
ance. is a student in Mr. Gotera‘s
mini~oourse. “The AsianrAmeri-
can experience is a valid part of
American history, so it should be
taught at Grinnell. We wanted a
coiirse about the Asian American
experience, particularly Asian
American literature. The English
Department has been really sup-
portive, and although it is difficult
to cover all of Asian American lit-
erature in 9 hours, this is deﬁnitely
something.“

Like many religions, Judaism is
for observers inextricably linked
withaplace and community ofwor-
ship. Grinnell lacks a synagogue
or a substantial Jewish population
outside of the college, and hence
Jewish students and faculty face ob»
stacles observing and feeling con»
nected to their religion.

The Jewish student group,
Chalutzim, overcomes these ob-
stacles for some Jewish students.
Chalutzim holds weekly meetings,
has a publicly accessible ofﬁce with
resources such as Jewish magar
zines, books, and scholarship infor
mation, More importantly for some.
Chalutzim has a Shabbat Table evA
ery Friday night to celebrate the
weekly Jewish day of rest. During

J udaiSm at Grinnell

Students seek to reconcile beliefs with environment

the recent holidays of Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
Chalutzim held worship services for
interested students. A service for the
harvest holiday ofSucchot is planned
for this upcoming Friday.

Grinnell College has also hired
Rabbi Jennifer Platte of Iowa City
to be on campus part-time. She now
occupies the position of Associate
Chaplain Rabbi Jennifer holds of»
fice hours and helps to lead the reli-
gious services and to lead or partici-
pate in other various activities of
Chalutzim.

Many Jewish students ﬁnd their
need for community and religion met
by Chalutzim and the pannime pres
ence ofa rabbi on campus. One stur
dent commented that before coming
to Grinnell. sheconsidered herselfto
be a non—observant Jew. but since
:u‘nving here last fall, she has become

more involved in her religion. She
explained. “Besides going to
Shabbat Table every week, I’m also
a board member of Chalutzim. I
still don’t go to every service (actu-
ally, [don‘t go to very many), but]
attribute my increased involvement
to the supportive, not to mention
friendly, members of Chalutzim."
Another student who is an observant
Jew finds that Chalutzim, along
with outside resources, helps him to
obey the laws oriudaisrn.
However, other Jewish students
ﬁnd that Chalutzim and a part-time
rabbi are not sufﬁcient means with
which they can feel spiritually and
culturally fulfilled. The lack of a
synagogue is painful for many.
Some students travel to lowa City
or Des Moines to attend services in
the synagogues there, while other

center, an art gallery and an orches-

Associates Michael Green and
Laura Turlington will join Cesar
Pelli as representatives of the firm
for the events planned for the
groundbreaking. Both said that the
design process was aided by a good
relationship with members of the
college administration and faculty.
Turlington said, “the College has
been a great client. We‘ve been re-
ally lucky in that respect."

The design for the new addition
incorporates existing structures and
surrounding buildings conceptually.
Turlington said the_ new building
will “let Burling be an object
building...the music structures will
wrap around to provide focus for
Burling,"

The architects did not want to
close off the space between the ad
dition and Burling. ”The side wall
of Burling acts as a backdrop for
the curved music structures,” she
said.
