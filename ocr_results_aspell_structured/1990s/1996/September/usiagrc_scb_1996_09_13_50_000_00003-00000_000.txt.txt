There is a mandatory class at Grinnell this year. This class meets rwtce a
day, including weekends, and is more stt-esstul and competitive titan any
other at Grinnell and if you don’t pass you don't eat. Tins class is called
Standing in Line. Yes, the students forced to stand in a queue which stretches
out to Omaha and moves at the rate of molasses in an Iowa winter surely

, deserve credit this year, maybe even a plus-2

Forthe study we analyized the line at Cowles for Tuesday dinner. Indeed,
that night I wttnessed the line as it stretched most of the way to Dibble.
The linevstandees had much to say to the 5&13. Typically, people would
initially declare profound Obscenities concerning the line. Of the people
interviewed, the overwhelming consensus is that the lines are worse this
year in terms oflength and duration. Also, they view the main Cause of tlte
slowrdown to be the self-service system.

I-Iorror stories raged at Cowles that night, Apparently. the line is often as
bad as this Tuesday‘s. Tim O’Neill (97’) said he had to eat out twice last
week because he couldn’t spend the time iii line. One group of weary line-
waiters said. “we didn’t eat until quarter till eight one night.”

Almost everyone I interviewed that night had a possible solution to the
problem. The most emphasis was put on correcting self service. Kallin
Mohr (‘97) said “I think self service is a really bad idea unless they have
two lines." Those interviewed were split between believmg that the prob
lem is structural and that the problem is simply people moving too slowly.
As support of the later, Elizabeth Lang (‘99) said, “people Just literally
stand there for ﬁve mintites and think about what they want." There is

general ltope that people will get better at moving through the line swiftly.
Many believe that the posting of menus will be greatly conducive to this
hope,

As for those who believe in structural changes, tlte suggestions range greatly
in magnitude and creativity. At the high end of the magnitude scale, one
person suggested that Grinnell build another cafeteria, However, most people
support the multiple line thcory. Several suggested that the selfrservice be
set up buffetrstyle so that two lines could pass by the food at once. Some
suggested that we revert back to the good old days of having line servers.
The familiar cry for longer hours at both dinning halls rang loudly. As I
interviewed someone shouted “everyone needs to shut the hell up and go to
Quad!" Whatever the solutions are, people are skeptical about the situation's
abatement by semester’s end. As a result of the chaos, many have taken
matters into their own hands.

Indeed, for some the lines duration is of much less consequence. Every
15 minutes I had a person who just started standing in line monitor the
duration of the wait. For those who stan at the back of the line the wait
was, on average, 25 minutes I also watched a few people cut the line and
wait only 5 minutes. In these early weeks of school line cutting seems to
have become a much used tactic,

One popular method of cutting is what I have labeled the chair method. In
the chair method, one will come into the lobby and sit on one of the chairs
stationedjust outside the door to Cowles. Then they wtll sit there for a few
minutes, perhaps chatting to a few buddies, and then after briefly soaking in
the atmosphere and perhaps feeling as iflhey won‘t be noticed, they'll shame-
lesslyjump into the lineyust a few minutes from food. I asked one person

sitting in a chair how they felt about the line situation this year. He said,
“They [the lines] don't bother me because I always out." Growl.

The longer duration of waiting seems to support line cutting. Amit :
Aggai'wal(‘99), wire was in the back of the line, said, “ifthe lines are going
to be this bad we are not left with any option other than to cut." Also, many i;
believe that the current situation warrants a dog-eat-dog mentality. They -'
believe that either nobody cuts or everybody cuts. Based on some observa-
tion it appcars that the later situation is in vogue.

I had a friend help me count the number ofcutters from 5:45 to about 7:10. ‘
In that time period we counted II4 cutters (33 by the chair method). The I
most honest of people are hurt the most by these people. They who endure '
the line which would be bad enough even without the cutters have found
their tensions to be rising. There is lots of finger-pointing going on, espe-
orally at spot-rs teams which arrive at dinner just before seven. As I was ;
asking Kentner Cottingham (‘98) how he felt about line cutting he said, .
“you’re going to see 70 more people out in line in about 5 minutes."

Pete Calaway (‘99) pointed out to me that all types of people cut in line. t'
Students in athletics just happen to be more conspicuous line-cutters. He .
said“ I’ve seen lots of people cut, but the sports teams are easily identiﬁable .
as the culprit." .

We need to correct the situation with the dinning halls. Given our already '-
stressful work loads these lines arejust too much. In the face of the present E
condition, however, I think that it‘s really important that we preserve our ,,
respect for each other, even in what may seem to be a trivial issue, namely, w
whether or not to cut in line.

Certain wisdoms get passed
along every year in the ACE of-
fice, i,e.. beef jerky is hard to
scrape offthe floor after disco but
students want it anyway.

Other facts also arise, like the
fact that only about half of the stu-
dents on campus go to the Harris
Center more than once or lWlCc a
semester for anything other thltn
movies. Or the fact that, about half
way through each semester, most
Harris parties get a bit redundant.
For the past several years, though
most people were aware of these
facts, no one seemed to know how
to broaden the appeal of events.

Three weeks into the School year.
it‘s again obvious to the ACE coni-
mittee that the campus is getting
bored. '

Simply put, we don‘t want to sit

around another year talking about
how to make events more diverse
and appealing to a larger cross-sec—
tion of campus. So... working
within the confines of a fairly
small budget and keeping in close
contactwith the films and concerts
chairs (all of whom fall underneath
the All»Campus Events
umbrella)here’s a few changes we
feel will help:
** A truly marrl»ba.rad system: in
the past, event organizers have had
the option to reserve a date, speci-
fying the event later. The flaws of
this system appeared when groups
with new, unique ideas were
turned down due to an already
fully reserved calendar. Not any
more,

To reserve a date now, a proposal
with a full description ofrhe evcnt
must be submitted. The ACE corti-
mittee reviews the proposal and
the requested date, considering doe
tails such as what events are schcdr

 

More Than a Disco
Ball.
All Campus Events

uled near it and whether or not it
has been done before (and, if so,
did a wide variety of people attend
and enjoy it).

**A newpapei trail: Befoi'eaprOr
posal becomes a scheduled event,
it has to clear two steps instead of
one, First, the proposal goes be
fore the ACE committee, who then
takes extra time to look closely at
the details and brainstorm any ex-
trti facets which might make the
event more appealing to more
people ,

Then, the event organizcr(s) re-
ceives feedback from ACE and has
a week to possibly add to the pro-
posal and answcrnny specific ques-
tions the committee might have, A
week later, the event organizer sits
at the ACE meeting and negotiates
a budget which makes everyone
happy. ,

This slightly new process adds

two important elements. First, it no
longer puts event organizers in a
position where their sole duty is to
defend a proposed budget, Our aim
is to reward the creative, Second,
it puts meaning back litto the pro-
cess in general ti,e., no more rubs
her stamps of approval or disap—
proval).
**M0reftill stuff in general. be
ready for a larger variety ofcvents.
such as CilinpllSrWIdC miniature
golf, a stand-up comedian (Septem-
ber 27). and roller-skating at Hat-
rls (November 23),

The point is. all-cantptts events
need to truly be all-campus. It a
ltlrgc segment or campus is uninr
terested ill the majority ofallrczlmr
pus events, then something rteeds
to change. If you're a run person
filled with fun campus wldc ideas,
let us know. If the college isn't lir
able and the cost doesn't wipe out
the cndowmcnt. chances are we’ll
try [0 make it happen.

A new approach to sexual policy

Getting personal with the issues of assault on campus

By DAVID BURNETT

Reporter

Women are responsible for their
rapes. Every man IS a potential rap—
ist, In sex, “no” means N0.

’These were sortie of the topics that
were discussed during this year's
New Student Orientation as Grinnell
College took a different approach
from past years in communicating
with new students
about sexual assault.
In the past, skits were
presented in the cine
enia to all of the new
students Thestudents
would then try to dis-
cuss the issues of
sexual assault by asks
ing questions and
talking about the is-
sucs as one large, un-
structured group.
When the program was redesigned
this year, it was changed to be more
thought provoking and personal to
the participants.

Lisa Matye, the Resident Life Cur
ordinalor for Clark and Dibble Halls,
helped design the new program
which is named “When Hello Gets
Out of Hand." Ms. Matye said the
program has been restructured to be
more personal Incoming students
are now split into 25 groups which
are spread throughout campus. Each

group contains two to three group fa-
cilitators, with at least one male and
one female facilitator, and no more
than sixteen students. According to
Ms. Matye, the group is led through
acontinuum exercise which is meant
to promote discusston about sexual
assault among the participants.

The new program was formed
through a cooperative effort between
both students and administration.

“Last year’s program
. . . was more harmful to
students than helpful. ”

reKerri Barndmble, Sexual Assault
Working Group Member

The new program began last year
when the SexuaLAssault Working
Group was formed to discuss meth-
ods of improving the current pro-
gram. This studentrled committee
worked with the administration to
improve education about sexual as-
sault and to develop the“When Hello
Gets Out ofI-Iarld" program. The for-
mation of this group was prompted
last year Wl’lei'l new students reacted
poorly to the former sexual assault
presentation.

“Last year’s program got out of
hand,” said Kerri Barnstuble, Sexual
AssaultWorkin g Group Member. “It
was more hannful to students than it
was helpful. It needed to be
changed," This year’s program is an
attempt to eliminate the problems
that occurred in the past. “When
Hello Gets Out of Hand" cuts down
the size of the group and gives the

discussion more structure. Dean of.

students, Torn Crady said “The new
format is meant to be more interaCr
tivc." Ms. Bamsluble also said, ”This
year's program gets everyone in,
Volved By participating, the students
become more aware of sexual as»
sault."

The main part of this year's pro-
gram revolvcd around the continuum
excrcrse which included nine state-
mean about acquaintance rape. Each
participant was to either agree. dis-
agree, strongly agree or strongly dis-
agree with each statement. The par-
ticipants then discussed each State-
ment and stated why they reacted the
way they did to it. In addition to this
part of the program, the participants
were given handouts which dealt
with topics such as ”My Safe Sex Bill
of Rights" and "Assertive Ways to
Stop Sexual Harassment."

At the end of the program, each par- '
ticipant ﬁlled out an evaluation of .
“When Hello Gets Out of Hand."Acr "
cording to Ms. Matye, “The students
overwhelmingly agreed that this pro-
gram was important. Many said it was
a very valuable program that we
should do again. " Kerri Barnstuble
who was also zi group facilitator said,
“The partICipants‘ response was very
positive. This program is a really big,
positive step. It was much better this
year, but it can still be built upon and
improved even more." The smaller
groups allowed more participants to
be actively involved in die discussion,
and this format allowed more students
to benefit from the program and learn
about sexual assault.

With such a positive response this
year, “When Hello Gets Out ofHand”
will most likely be used in years to
come Lisa Matye said, “The ﬁnal
decision will be up to the New Stu-
dent Orientation Committee, but there
is a good chance that the program will
continue in a similar format."

This year’s “When Hello Gets Out ;
of Hand" brought sexual assault to the t
attention of students, and it caused ,
participants to openly discuss a topic '
which is often kept silent. ‘

Grinnell is a safe
place to bike...

just remember
to lock it up!
