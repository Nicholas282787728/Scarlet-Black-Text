sentation in Roberts Theater at 8 p.m. to-

accommodate a slide presentation. It will
follow a groundbreaking ceremony at
4:45 just north ofthe construction site.

This afternoon's untraditional
groundbreaking ceremony will formally
mark the construction of Grinnell’s new
Fine Arts building.

“The impetus oftl‘te building was the
high level of quality programs and the
high levels of participation that we have
in the arts, so it seemed ﬁtting to do a
Grinnell Groundbreaking," said Director
of Annual Giving Michael Munley. “At

Pelli'sﬁrm designed the twin
PETRONAS towers in Malaysia.

 

 

 

Grinnell we do things a little differently,
and a little better," The groundbreaking
will not involve shovels or hard hats, ex—
plained Munley, but rather a presentation

by those involved in the development of
the new building.

The groundbreaking will consist of
remarks by President Ferguson, Chair of
the Board of Trustees Elizabeth
Bhllanune, Professor Ian Czecllowski,
and Cesar Pelll. Also featured will be per-
formallces by The Grinnell Singers and
The Young Gifted and Black Choir, as
well as a singing of a historical Grinnell
song and a reading by Jason Nagel ‘97.
The event will conclude with a living art
activity titled “Hands" coordinated by
Matt Salia ‘97.

Salia's “Hands" project will be a cola
laborative piece “by everybody at the
school that not only reﬂects the character
ofeach individual, but the collective gath-
erlng of every one involved in the
project," said Saiia. “It’s a project that
reflects the individuals including Cesar
Pelli. architects from Pclli's firm in New
Haven, college ofﬁcials, professors. trusts
ces, and students where each individual
can leave their mark," he said.

Participants will make a print of their
hand on squares that form a larger grid.
“It’s a way to symbolize the diverse in-
volvement of everyone at Grinnell in the
arts," said Munley. Groundbreaking orr
ganizers invite the entire campus to para
iicipate in the ceremony.

Pelli was honored with The Ameri-
can institute of Architects (AIA) 1995
Gold Medal. According to the AIA, the
Gold Medal recognizes a lifetime of dis—
tinguished achievement and outstanding
contributions to architecture and the hu-
man environment. Elected by the AIA

Monks to highlight plight of
Tibetans in cultural exchange

By TOM TAYLOR
Reporter

For those whose exposure to Tibetan
culture has thus far been limited to’the
chorus of monks chanting behind MCA
on the Beastie Boys‘ 1994 release 11]
Communication, the arrival of the La-
mas of Sera Je on campus next week
offers a chance to learn more about a
people and a spiritual tradition strugr
gling for survival. _

The Lamas. a group of Tibetan
monks and scholars, will be perform~
ing next Friday evening at 8:00 PM in
Herrick Chapel as part of a worldwide
multimedia tour designed to draw at—
tention to the plight olebet and to raise
funds for the maintenance and expan-
iion of the Buddhist monastery and
'efugee community in Karnataka State,
South India.

Following the invasion of Tibet by
Shinese Communist forces in 1959 and

he subsequent escape of the Dalai'

sama to refuge in India, Tibetan Buds
jhists have been forced to maintain
heircultural and religious traditions in
exile or at extreme risk in their home

land, Thus, in the last three decades,
Tibetans have taken their fight for free
dom and independence onto the world
stage.

The performance, entitled Wildlif,
Tamed Mind, will include a selection
of dance, music and chants designed to
give the audience a taste of both the

pre»Buddhist and Buddhist cultural and ,

spiritual traditions in Tibet. The pro-
gram will also offer a slide show and
video of excerpts from conversations
with the Dalai Lama.

The performance here on campus is
the Lamas’ only stop between Chicago
and El Paso and was a coup for The Stu
dents for a Free Tibet, the campus or-
ganization responsible for bringing
them to Grinnell, The organization,
formed last year, has worked both on
and off campus to raise awareness of
the Tibetan situation among the student
body and Grinnell community.

The event promises to be an enlight-
ening experience for anyone interested
in Tibetan religion and culture, non-
Western muSlc or a plcasureable
evening wtth men and women of great

writing and poetry at the University of
Northern Iowa, is teaching a minis
course in Asian American Literature at

Although Grinnell has brought in
many AsianrAn-icrican speakers in past
years, including Ronald Takaki, LeAnn
How. and Grinnell alumnus David
Mura, this is the first Asian-American
literature course Grinnell has offered,
“I see Grinnell as breaking new ground

because it hasn‘t really had a great deal
ofAsiall American studies before," said
Mr. Gotera. “I am really proud to be
doing this."

The course will be covering Maxine
Hong Klngston’s The Woman Warrior:
Memoirs ofa Girl/mod Among 0/1051:
and the anthology Asian American Lil»
eralure, which includes selections of
Mr. Gotera's work.

Veterans, Dragon Fly. Two more books
are underway. Mr. Gotera remembers
writing his first poem at the age of four

he said.
