For decades, the GDP has consistently lobbied

Dear Editor.

I am the moderator of Pagan Dis-
cussion Circle. I have already spor
ken with Sean Mchinty and we have
resolved many ofthe issues that were
raised by his cartoon “Blped Ted.“
I would like to explain to the came
pus why I felt the cartoon was such
a problem when it was “clearly
meant as ajoke."

Idiscussed “Biped Ted” with many
people who held a variety of opin-
ions about its content. Several people
thought the cartoon was offensive,
but “not worth getting upset about."
Others said that the cartoon was in

told me that “the ignorance of others
is not my problem.”

Unfortunately, when you belong to
a small minority rellgion like Pagan-
ism, the ignorance of others becomes
your problem whether you like it or
not Pagan Discussion Circle belongs
to some nationwide Pagan
newsgroups and mailing lists, and
as 1 read them i frequently ﬁnd inci-
dents in which Pagans are the vic-
tims of discrimination. It is not un»
common for Pagan parents to lose
custody of their children because of
their religious beliefs. Sometimes
Pagans are denied tenant rights sima

that are guaranteed to other religious
organizations. Discrimination like
this occurs because people either
dont know or don‘t care to leam the
truth about Paganism. When people
use negative stereotypes about Pa-
gans as “jokes" they are helping to
perpetuate those stereotypes. When
people of our faith are routinely de-
nied their basic civil rights based on
these stereotypes, it is incredibly dif-
ficult to laugh about incidents in
which our religion is made the butt
of a public joke.

I want to thank Sean McGinty for
speaking with me about his cartoon
and for his willingness to consider
our viewpoint. I hope that we have
reached a better understanding of
this issue.

Thank you. Next week‘s topic will be “Bill Clinton,

Let's just start off with a pop quiz:

Why did Clinton write that he was against the raise
ing of the minimum wage in 1994 and then attempt to

increase it in 1996'!

a: Congress was Democratically controlled in 1994.
so he couldn't ask for an increase and then blame
Republican’s for defeating it in their mean-spirited
zeal to destroy all that is good in America.

b: 1994 wasn’t a presidential election year (mini-
mum wage increase is third only to declaring war and
soaking the rich when it comes to gaining support.
That middle-tax cut idea probably won’t work this
time after he promised one in 1992 and raised taxes

instead.)

c: The Unions are for a minimum wage increase,
In fact,

of a massive political contribution aimed to desconce

members that the law forces them to give these dues

reason).
it: atbc
Correct answer: d.

Let's just look at what a minimum wage does (be-
side add to the amount of constraint placed on us by
our everrexpanding government). It is one of the few
things that manages to increase both inﬂation and
unemployment at the same time. A major staple of
modern-day economic theory is the concatenation of
inﬂation and unemployment. It is hard to decrease
one without increasing the other, Reagan did it, but
then again Reagan was 'an economic god, bettering
the economy more in each of his terms than any other
president since WW. II (for those who care. Kennedy!
Johnson gets third place, and Truman's second term

gets fourth).

Clinton loves to talk about the minimum wage need-
ing to be a “living wage.” This is hisjustiflcation for
increasing it. He is wrong on both accounts: a mini-
mum wage is just that, a minimum wage. It is meant
to be for entry level positions from which determined
people can climb. And his increasing the minimum
only puts more people on the unemployment rolls,
making more people dependent upon the government,
and therefor more people likely to vote for the party
of Govemment. He is crafty, I Will give him that.

Now to end on a sad note. Some of the House Re-
publicans bowed under political pressure and passed
(with massive help from the Democrats) their own
minimum wage increase. This serves to inculpate
these members rather than afﬁrm their action.

Dear Editor: ,
I am angry with your choice to pub-
lish the cartoon depicting a pagan
who
sacriﬁces rats. Apparently there was
a similar cartoon which I did not see-
the previous week; if I had, I would
have written sooner.

Iam pagan. I believe in the beauty.
of life and existence. I believe that:
divinity is the spark within each oft
us that makes us unique, and Ichoose' '
to express my spirituality through:

meditation and private worship. if

consider myself a deeply religious-
person. Although my beliefs aret
unique to me, many of them are ,
shared by other pagans in the Grin-’-
neli community and worldwide.

I found the cartoon deeply hurtful,
both to myself and to pagans in gen-
eral.

I am a strong supporter of free '
speech, butI believe that free speech

isa right which carries with it the re-‘
sponsibility to be informed. IfSean '

the AFLVCIO

 

McGinty had no idea what paganism
is when he drew the cartoon, then he
is guilty of ignorance and irrespona
sibility. Ifhe knew the truth, then he
is guilty of hateful speech and the de»
liberate spread of lies. I certainly
hope theformeris thecase,andlsusr
pect that he was merely ignorant of
the truth.

I am more concerned with the de-
cision of the 8&8 to publish the car—
toon. When I spoke with Leslie
Madsen. the features editor, she in-
formed me that she did not want to
see it published, but that the chief
editors chose to publish it in order to
generate a response. I resent my reg
liglon being used in this manner. It
is one thing to publish a well-reg
searched editorial on the subject of
paganism to encourage readers to
respond: it is quite another to puba
lish a piece which even the editors
find offensive and ﬁlled with ignoa
rance. just to stir up controversy. I
feel that the 5&3 demonstrated irre-
sponsible journalism by printing this

look at a few. Nearly two dozen different studies
have proven that the Republican claim that the mini~
mum wage (and increases thereof) costs jobs, is
wrong. And just about every recent study that says
differently was funded by the fast—food industry,
which hates the minimum wage. But, let’s look at
some real-world data. In 1992, New Jersey voted
to increase its minimum wage, and Pennsylvania
voted not to increase its minimum wage. Accord
ing to Republicans, we should see unemployment

If we want to see
more people get oﬂ
of welfare, we need

to make it eco—
nomically feasible
for that to happen.
And that means a
higher minimum

wage.

in New Jersey go up. it didn‘t happen.

Finally, some Republicans believe that the gov~
eminent has no business tinkering with the private
sector. Working at $5.15 an hour(the current mini-
mum wage), someone working forty hours a week
pulls down about‘SlODDO a year. That's not much
more than you get ifyou're on welfare, and that‘s
exactly the problem. If we want to see more people
get off of welfare. we need to make it economically
feasible for that to happen. And that means a higher
minimum wage.

I’ll close with a summary. Here‘s what Republi-
cans say about the minimum wage, and increases to
it: 1, It costs Workers theirjobs. Sorry, Charlie, but
it just ain't so. Studies disagree, and real-world ex-
perience disagrees.
stands to get hurt more: businesses because we have
a minimum wage, or workers with families if we do
away with the minimum wage? 3. Government .
shouldn’t interfere with the private sector. It‘s the
government's job to try to ensure that everyone who

, has ajob can pay for food and shelter. And that’s
what the minimum wage is about. Because, with
out the minimum wage, more people will end up
living on welfare, and we already know how Rea
publicans feel about that.

2. It hurts businesses. Who

cartoon.

I wish I could laugh this off as a
joke, but I already have people seri-
ously asking me whether I perform
sacriﬁces. Idon‘t need any more
misinformation to encourage such a
hurtful ,and inaccurate stereotype.
Besides, why should pagans be the
religious group depicted in such a
negative way? Would the S&B print
a cartoon which depicted anotherre-
ligious group, such as Christians or
Jews, as sacrificing animals? They
don‘t Sacrifice animals; neither do
we. I hope that Sean McGinty (and
members ofthe Grinnell campus and
community) will take the time to
learn more about paganism. Before
you make controversial and poten-
tially offensive cements, you must
be responsible enough to know what
you are talking about.

Sincerely,

Dear Editor:

We are writing to express our disn
may over the harassment of the Grin.
nell Pagan community. Grinnell Cola
lege has long been a liberal and ac
cepting place where we have felt
comfortable in practicing our spiri-
tuality. However, since the begin.
ning of this semester, we have per
ceived a growing intolerance of our
beliefs which is based on ignorance
and misconception.

It began with the SA skits during
New Student days. In one skit, Pa-
gans were depicted as dancing
around the Zirkle “worshipping their
menstmal blood.”

The Grinnell Pagan community
consists of both men and women.
Paganism is a religion which be
lieves in the sanctity and divinity of
all life. Our ceremonies express this
by expressing joy in the changing of
the seasons and of the lunar cycles.
We do not "worship our menstrual
blood;” the male members of our
group would ﬁnd that very difﬁcult
to do. We did not speak out publicly
about the skit at that time because
we felt it to be a minor incident.

However, we now realize that by
allowing that incident to pass with»
out comment, we may have sent out
the message that Paganism is a reli-
gion to be mocked. We found last
week’s cartoon “Biped Ted" by Sean
McGinty offensive and demeaning to
Pagans. He portrayed us as people

who sacrtﬁce rats; nothing could be
further from the truth. As we stated
before, Paganism is a peaceful relir
gion. We do not sacriﬁce creatures;
in fact, many of us are paciﬁsts and
vegetarians. Sean McGinty‘s car.
toon perpetuates damaging stereo~
types about Pagans.

In response to the common opin-
ion thzit both of these events were just
iokes and not intended to ham, we
ask you to consider the effects of
spreading misconceptions about a
religious group, especially when that
group is already a religious minority
whose beliefs are not widely known.
When people are unsure as to what
Pagans actually do, they are easily
convinced that these jokes contain a
grain of truth. Therefore, these jokes
are harmful to us because they rein-
force stereotypes tibout Paganism.

In order to combat the misconcep-
tions and rumors about Paganism on
campus, the Pagan Discussion Circle
will be sponsoring study breaks in
the dorms as soon as possible to en-
courage people to learn more about
Paganism. The study breaks about
rellgion will be hosted by the multi»
faith dialogue group that is being
formed on campus. The breaks will
not be about Paganism speciﬁcally,
they will be about religious tolerence
and diversrty on campus. Addition-
ally, everyone is welcome to our
meetings in Steiner 305 from‘7-9pm
every Thursday evening; you need

not be Pagan to attend. We hope the
campus community will take the
time to ﬁnd out who Pagans really
are and what we believe.

Sincerely.

To die Editols.

I disagree that just because students at
Grinnell are expected to be responsible
for themselves. police patrols on cam
pus should not he pemtitted, Most people
in the United States are Expected to be
responsible for themselves, but that does
not exempt them from the law. College

students are not above the law either, al- .

though they are usually treated as if they
were. Illegal activities such as underage
drinking and marijuana use should be
punished, and it is elitist to state that be-
cause sntdcnts should be “self govema
ing," they shouldn‘t reap thetreward for
themselves which their actions have
earned.

There is a double standard today that if
a poor inner-city resident is doing drugs.
he should be given the maximum pun-
ishment allowable under law. while if a
college student or upperaclass
businessperson is doing the same drugs.
he or she is given a minimal punishment,
if any. In the past, the college has appar
ently condoned this double standard by
turning a blind eye to the students the
gal activities, so i personally hope the
police patrols will actually enforce the
laws of this country on this campus, in
the interest of fairness and justice.

Dear Editor:

I read in the Des Moines Register
the other day that actor/musician
Tupac Shakur died. He was shot to
death. He was only 25 years old, just
slightly older than me.

I’m not a fan of Shakur's music, and
I don’t agree With most of his poli-
tics, but I do know that no one de-
serves to be shot to death. There are
people who disagree with me, though.
Some people have said that Shakur
got what he deserved. i suppose
they‘re part of the “those who live by
the sword, should die by the swor "
camp.

I think they're part of the problem
that killed him. It seems almost fash-
ionable these days to wish death upon
one‘s ”opponents.” People seem less
and less able to respectfully disagree
or to seek a workable consensus and
more and more attracted to intoler—
ance and hate. You can observe ele-
ments of this attitude right here at
Grinnell. Whether it‘s in the class-
room, on the walls of Burling. or in
letters to the editor, dogmatic rage
seems to be becoming a dominant
theme. The people who murdered
Shakur weren’t interested in civil, re-
specth discourse and neither are the
people who said he got what he de-
served. Whether they realize it or not.
they're both part of the same vicious.
intolerant mind-set. a mindset that’s
making the United States an increas
ingly unpleasant place to live.

Dear Editor.

We would like to show our support for
The Grinnell Pagan Discusion Circle as
well as our dismay at the continuation of
uninformed stereotyping on Grinnell’s
campus, as was displayed in Sean
McGinty’s 9/13/96 canoon in the S&B.
This kind of 11310me
at other members of the college commu~
nity. is inexcusable. We live on a small
campus, and there is no reason for igno
tame-based stereotypes. Ask us who we
are, what we are about and what we do.

To the Grinnell College Community,
I am, in my opinion, somebody
who does not deserve to be in this
place. I truly hate it. What’s in-
teresting though is that I have
given a lot of people shit, and
unapologetically. That's another
story. What I’d like to express as
an appreciated shock is the many
visits I got when I was hospital-
ized, for the first time in my life
except the day mom gave birth to
me. TWO weeks wasn‘t funny, but
letters, gifts of ﬂowers and visits
by faculty members (a lot of
them) and administration staff, all
made it possible to reach a quick
recovery. The alien in the neck is
gone. For the ‘first' time, ad-
vanced and highly treasured
American technology superiority
could not provide a diagnosis.

My thanks go to all my white
friends who were by my bedside
much of their time. my black
brothers and sisters who visited
and talked to me: thank you. My
professors, including the Ex.
President and the administration
staff that I always trouble by de-
livering too many pieces of mail
on a “blue Monday."

Christian Varsity members,
Bible Study Group and individu~
als all played a role in getting me
out of that institution. 1 “don‘t
deserve it," Life said.

I can‘t thank everybody indi»
vidually, hence this letter. Before
I take a pause, I must tell you that
the Mail Room (Source of Grin-
nell College Communication with
the world outside and away from
the corn ﬁelds) Gang has been the
Greatestlt Most of all. I have been
surprised by the quick transfor-
mation of information in Grin-
nell. Thank you ALL!
