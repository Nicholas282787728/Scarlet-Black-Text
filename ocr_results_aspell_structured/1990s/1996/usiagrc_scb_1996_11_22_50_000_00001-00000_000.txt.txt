lnterVarsity loses official group status

college oﬂicials decide group leadership decision violates nondiscrimination policy

BY DANYA LEEBAW
AND ANDY BRooxs

In a meeting last night, Dean of Stu-
dents Tom Crady and Vice President of
Human Resources Frank Thomas told
members of Grinnell‘s InterVarsity Chns—
tian Fellowship that their group no longer
qualiﬁes as an ofﬁcial registered student
group. According to these representatives
ofthe college administration, the group’s
criteria for selection of leaders, brought
to public attention by group member
Rebecca Hamis’s ‘97 recent resignation
from leadership, violates the college‘s
nondiscrimination policy.‘

Group members assembled at the
meeting were visibly dismayed at the
college‘s decision and had many ques-
tions for Crady and Thomas about the ime
plications of losing their registered sta
tus. Their concerns mostly centered on
deﬁnition of the nondiscrirrunatjon policy
as well as the privileges and rights the
group would no longer retain.

Before arriving at an ofﬁcial position,
Thomas asked the assembled members
of InterVarsity, “A person who believes
what the resigned student believes can
not be a leader of this groqu Is that cor—
rect?” Chris Pallas ‘98 responded, “Yes.”

In a later response, Pallas said, “We
cannot allow into leadership those who
don‘t believe in the authority of the Scripr
ture, because they, in effect, have not
made a decision to live by the word of
God."

One member raised the point atThurs-
day night‘s meeting that religion is also
protected under the nondiscrimination
policy. This member said, “This is our
view. Aren‘t you discriminating against
us?”

Thomas and Crady maintained the
college's position that the group’s non-
compliance lies not in their private view-
points but in their actions based on those
viewpoints, which Thomas described as
“exclusionary. It moves beyond the realm
of religious belief and practice.”

New industries bring
jobs to Grinnell

Ebb and ﬂow of
business cycle
continues, even in
Grinnell, Iowa

BY MICHELE HOST
Staff Writer

The sleepy comﬁelds of Grinnell are
not usually mentioned in discussions of
America's industrial centers, but in recent
years Grinnell's businesses have been
closing, opening, and changing hands
with almost city-like speed.

The most notable recent business trans
action began last year, when Farmhand/
Agricultural Equipment closed its plant
on Highway 146. According to Terry
Walker, the economic development coor-
dinator of Poweshiek Area Development
(PAD), many local businesspeople had
reason to worry when Agricultural Equip
merit closed its doors, First, l72jobs were
lost. Another important concern was the
physical plant itself. Agricultural
Equipment's building was extremely
large, and PAD thought that it would take
two to three years to fill the building with
another tenant.

The Grinnell area was lucky, however,
when after much negotiation United
Screw and Bolt company bought the
building, Walker calls this transaction the
“biggest and best news" in Grinnell in~
dustry, because the company has already
provided 65 jobs to the area and antici-
pates the creation of up to 200 morejobs
within 18 months.

United Screw and Bolt is a metal fab-
rication company, and will now be known
as Grinnell Products. The company does
not actually produce screws and bolts, but
metal stampings which are then provided
to other companies such as John Deere.

Student Government Association
PresldentRupin Thakkar, who is respon~
sible for implementing the effects of the
change in InterVarsity‘s status, said ear
list this week, pending an official admins
istrative decision, “

InterVarsity will not qualify to apply
for funding, have a copy code, or have
file cabinet space." 'Ihakkar also noted
that it is against college policy to fund
religious activities; however, as recently
as last year, InterVarsity received funds
ing for non-religious events. The decision
to ask Harms to step down “violates the
college’s nondiscrimination policy," he
said. ’Ihakkar said the college had sought
legal advice before arriving at this deci-
sion.

Harms conﬁrmed her dissenting view-
point. She said of homosexuality, “I be-
lieve it’s a position that Christians can
agree to disagree about. I believe that
my position is supported in the Bible."

During small Bible study sessions ear-
lier this fall which mostly involved group
leaders, Harms realized that her views on
homosexuality and Biblical authority dif-
fered from those of the other leaders.
Upon this realization, Harms wrote in a
letter to the other leaders an outline of
her views on homosexuality and the Bible
and said she would accept their decision
regarding whether or not she should re-
sign based on those views. ,

“They had a meeting, they came back
to me, and said they thought it was best
ifI did step down," Harms said. Harms
abided by this decision and announced it
to the entire group at the largergtoup
meeting the week prior to Fall Break.
Asked about the general reaction to her
decision to step down, 'W‘

Harms said that ”people were really
surprised." While members of the group
have differing Views of homosexuality
and Christianity, Harms said, “I believe
that everyone in the group supports me,
and recognizes this is painful."

Despite her disagreement with the
leadership concerning homosexuality and
Biblical authority, Harms remains amem-

ber of InterVarsity. Asked why she res
rained her membership, Harms said,
“Community is really vital to the Chris»
tian faith. InterVarsrty provrdcs a lot of
things that many Christians on campus
are looking for," Harms acknowledged
that she does know of one homosexual
in the group and although this student is
not comfortable with the leadership‘s po-
sition on homosexuality, “there is so
much in IV‘ that's valuable that even
though he disagrees with this he feels it's
worth it to stay in the group. That's basre
cally my position too."

Harms stated her belief that her resige
nation “is an internal issue within the
group because this is a faith issue. We
are working on it in a way that involves
faith and respect and the attitude of love.
Christians are called to work with each
other in a certain way. NoneChristians
aren’t called to work together in this way,
that‘s why it's important that it‘s inter~
nal.”

Regarding the campus community‘s
concern with the situation, Harms said.
“It’s understandable. It's not going to
change any minds within the group,
which is the goal of anyone who believes
homosexuals can be leaders within the
group.”

Grinnell College Chaplain Deanna
Shorb, in an interview earlier this week,
expressed her hope that the college come
munity understands thatdiverse opinions
and beliefs exist within the Christian
faith.

Chaplain Shorb said,“faith is all about
individual theological interpretation.”
The Chaplain stated that she understands
faith as an individual process ofinterpret-
ing the Bible. She said, “Our theological
understanding and belief should stem
from a combination of our interpretation
of scripture, our religious tradition (de-
nominational understanding), reason, and
experience."

The Chaplain was present at Thursday
night's meeting and helped to clarify the
viewpoints of both the administration and
InterVarsity. In response to one

InterVarsity member's question concem-
ing the college’s position on leadership in
other religious or political campus groups,
administrators and the Chaplain said that
the nondiscrimination policy still applies. -
The Chaplain said, for instance, regard-
ing leadership of Chalutzim, “A non-Jew
would have to be considered equally or it
would be discriminatory."

Anna Carney, the adviser for the
Grinnell and UNI chapters of InterVarsity
and hired by the national organization,
commented on Thursday night’s an-
nouncement, “About no longer receiving
funding,” she said, “I feel really good
about that integrity-wise, because our sys-
tem of beliefs are in conﬂict with the
college’s system of beliefs. I agree with
them that it would be wrong [to give
InterVarsity funding] given the stance the
college has chosen to take regarding
GLBT issues."

Carney said that while InterVarsity
chapters at other colleges have grappled
with questions of homosexuality and the
groups' beliefs, the Grinnell chapter is the
ﬁrst InterVarsity group to lose status as
an ofﬁcial registered group.

Reactions on the part of leaders and
other members to last night's meeting
were mixed. Group leader Ali Berger ‘99
said, “I hope that I demonstrated a serv-
ing and respectful heart towards the ad-
ministrators.“ Group member Josh
Sexson ‘99 expressed disappointment
with the administration’s decision and
said, “It is too bad that Christians should
be persecuted for literally believing in the
Bible's stance, no matter what the issue."

Group leader Chris Jennings ‘98 did not
express disappointment about
InterVarsity’s loss of status as a registered
group, but said rather, ”Jesus says in the
book of John in the Bible, ‘I am the resur-
rection and the life. He who believes in
me will live, even though he dies; and
whoever lives and believes will never die.‘
So, if I believe in Jesus, then Jesus will
give me eternal life. If I will have eternal
life, it matters little that InterVarsity is now
not an ofﬁcial student group on campus."

in the South Lounge of the Forum. Mr. Lee
began the reading with a few published
poems, but he then mainly read selections

better described as prayers than as poems.
