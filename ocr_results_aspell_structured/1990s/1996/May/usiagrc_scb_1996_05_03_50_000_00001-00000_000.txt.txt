According to ASIA spokesper—
son Mike Jacobs ‘98, “This issue of
spnco has been handled by the atl.
ministration (or six yeots...an(l hasi.
cally all that has happened is [hat the
administration has tnltl us we will

the administration "to show us ac—
tion rather than Committees to vali—

The rent protest (l|(l not occur

but was a symbolic stntomont. This
yenrmarks notonly the 150th yeatof
Grinnell’s existence, biit also the
twenty—fifth anniversary of the ﬁrst
Asian American Studies major in
America. Grinnell does not have an
Asian American Studies program.

While tho protest may have
made many students uncomfortable
because it occurred on walt: \\'eek«

that for once they could lust forget
about issues. but lorstudentsofcolor
these issues are salitnt regardless oi

ASIA asserts that they need a
cultural space like the symbolic tent
because their office is not large
enough to meet the current needs of
tlieiraoinomhors toroihoe, meeting,
and resource space. The only place
for ASIA to meet is in the Forum
Coffeehouse. There are constraints
on what activities they can hold in
this meeting space due to events in
the South Lounge. A pamphlet
which was distributed at the demon<
strationpartiallyexplained“Wehave
no privacy to hold actiVities of our
own choosing and must be careful of
the liaise level, as we might be a
disturbance to speakers in the South
lounge," Also because ASIA shares
the office With other student groups

and organizations, they must reserve
the room tar in ntlinnce. This pre-
vents any opportunity foremergcncy
meetings when the need arises.

that they have no money to fund o

Jacobs believes that the debate
is not Simply over funds, but ideolo

Jacobs says that a separate cul—
