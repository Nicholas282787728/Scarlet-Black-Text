Simawe examines images of African slaves

English Professor publishes research on racist ideologies

ANDY WEIDNER
STAFF Warren

Grinnell College assistant pro.
fessor of English saadi Simawe is
currently undertaking a study of the
defining features of 9th century ls.
lamie racism in comparison with the
American Christian ideology or rat}
ism. simawe recently presenred part
of his research, "The Revolt of the
Zanj and the Portrayal of African
Slaves in the Medieval Islamic
World," at the 56th Annual Con—
vention of the college Language
Association in WinstonSalem, NC
on April 13th.

Immediately after the presenta—

tion, Slmawcwas asked by the editor
orthe College Language Association
journal for permission to publish the
article.

"Thousands of Zan], east Afrir
can blacks, were brought from Africa
into southern Iraq to drain the salt
marshes east of Basra. They were
subjected to heavy slave labor and
provided with only minimum subsis-
tence. After many decades. the Zanj
revolted against their Arab/Muslim
masters, to establish their own inde-
pendent state that was defeated after
two decntles by the Islamic imperial
army," Slmaw says.

He adds, “The paper compares
andconttastsArabic/Islamicandthe

American christian images ofblack
people, to help illuminate the link
between racist ideologies and pow—

er.

The basis for Islamic discrimi-
nation against blacks was rooted in
language and religious differences
rather than in color as is the case in
the American Christian racist ideol—
ogy. notes simnwe. Simawe is an.
able to definitively explain the Med
logical dirrerence but hypothesizes
that in order to have an effective
policy of racism there miist be strike
ing differences between the parties
involved, and in the case of the 9th
century Islamic people, the differ
ence in color was not very apparent.

Simawe is still looking ror any evi—
t‘lence among the ancient Islamic
texts he |S translating which would
linlt the Islamic racist ideology with
color differences.

Although his work is not com«
plete. Simawe tentatively concludes
that no empire can be built Without
access to slave labor. The means to
procure this labor lies with the abil—
ity ofa racist ideology toconvmce all
parties involved that they belong in
their prescribed roles, says Simawe,
In this respect, according toSimawe,
the American Christian system was
extremely efficient. using the Bible
to justify the enslaveinent of blacks.

At the conference, one audi<

ence membetasked why many blacks
convert to Islam under the pretense
that it is not racist in any respect
when it is known what occurred dur»
ing the 9th century. Simawe cites a
paper he wrote two years ago which
explains the misconceptions about
Islam that Malcolm X spread after
his vi5it to Mecca. MalcolmX chose
to overlook the racism present in
Islamic society in order to fashion a
religion to suits his needs. Accord—
ing to Simawe, this has been a com—
mon theme in the history of man—
kind. Although neither Islam nor
Christianity condone slavery, these
religious beliefs have been perverted
and distorted to justify the institw
tion nonetheless.
