COMMENTARY

One of “The Truly Great”:
Martin Luther King, Jr.

BY DARRYL ROBERTS
Columnist

The late Stephen Spender wrote
the poem below in memory of the
soldiers who fought and died in
WW1. But he whom we do this day
honor and remember was “[blorn of
the sun and traveled a short while
toward the sun and left the vivid air
signed with his hono’r." Martin
Luther King, Jr. flanuary 15 1927—
April 4, 1968—was our leader, our
teacher and certainly one of the
greatest thinkers in “the souls his
tory."

King calls us to serve and we have
not responded to that call; he calls
us to nonviolence and we have not
responded to that call: he calls us to
human decency and we have not re
sponded to that call,

And for those of us who are will-
ing and able to respond to the call
to love. the call to nonviolence and
to the call to human decency, King
leaves behind two great principles
that he lived by and would like us
to live by in order to create a more
humane and just society.

The first principle that King
teaches us is the universal principle
of human decency. It says that we
have both a moral and ethical obli-
gation to treat everyone decently
and that it is our privilege and right
to be treated decently by others.
King believed that each person has
worth and dignity which must be
recognized and respected. When

one negates the humanity ofanother
human being, King believed that
that individual was in fact negating
his or her own humanity.

King called us to human decency,
but he also called us to nonviolence.
Appropriating the teachings ofMa»
hatma Gandhi, Martin believed that
nonviolence was the only Viable, ef-
fective and moral tool for advancA
ing the struggle for racial and eco-

to defeat injustice and not people,
It struggles not only to save the vice
tlms of injustice, but is also
struggles to save the conscious of
the pcrpetuators of injustice by re-
minding them of their creed and
basic ideals, The third principle em-
phasizes collective and personal re-
sponsibility as it seeks to promote
huiiianhood. friendship and under-
standing; its end result is redemp-

 

I think continually of those who are truly great.
Who, front the womb, remembered the souls history
Through corridors of light, where the hours are silns,

Endless and singing...

 

Born ofthe sun, they traveled a short while toward the sun
And left the vivid izir signed with their honor,

 

nomic justice and equality. The
Martin Luther King, Jr. Center For
Nonviolent Social Change Inc. iden—
tiﬁes six principles of Nonvtolence
that were at the core of King’s the-
ology and philosophy.

The ﬁrst emphasizes a personal
commitment and states that nonvioV
lence is a way oflife for courageous
people; it is active nonviolent re-
sistance to any evil, and is passive
only in its non-aggression toward
evil. The second principle empha-
sizes a sense of purpose as it seeks

tion and reconciliation.

The fourth and fifth principles cone
vey a sense of resolve and choice.
Nonviolence believes that unearned
suffering is redemptive and has tre-
mendous educational and transfer
mative possibilities. 1r opposes vio-
lence ofthe spirit as well as violence
of the body. Though spontaneous,
unselﬁsh, and creative, nonviolence
is aggressive in its ability to love,
forgive and to create a hospitable
and healthy environment for all con—
cerned. The ﬁnal principle emphar

sizes a sense of balance and moral
order and believes that the universe
is on the side ofjustice. The nonvio-
lent resister maintains a deep and
abiding faith that justice, though
long overdue, would be triumphant.

These are the core teachings and
primary principles that King lived by
and gave his life to uphold. King calls
America and the world to choose a
life rooted in the universal principles
of human decency and nonviolencc.
Today we stand at the threshold ofa
new century and we are challenged
more than ever before to make the
American Dream, which King and
so many other “suns" gave their lives
to uphold, a near and present reality
for all Americans,

Yes, much has accomplished over
the past few decades in the struggle
for justice and humanity: today the
globalization of the economy has
calmed fears of Violent conﬂict; af-
ﬁrmative action programs have pro
vided greater gains in education, in-
come and opportunity for women,
blacks and other “minorities." How-
ever, the emergence of large
underclass, the dismantling of one
titlement programs, the rising tide of
racism, sexism, fascism and reaction-
ary right~wing bigotry, and the pro-
liferation of drugs, crime, and hopes
lcssness has created a catastrophic
situation all across this nation requir-
ing a bold response by dedicated and
principled individuals to meet the
challenges of this present hour.

Our challenge today is to serve
through the teachings of Martin
Luther King, Jr. The time‘is now.
Choose King as a model for your life
because he mastered and modeled
what he spoke.

As most of you know, last Fri-
day we made a presentation to the
Board of Trustees about the space
needs of both student interest
groups and multi-cultural organi-
zations on our campus. The goal
of this presentation was to raise
the Trustees’ awareness of our
needs and to gain their philosophi—
cal recognition of the many ben—
eﬁts to expanding the Forum. The
response to our presentation was
positive, and we now have permis~

 

 

sion to make a formal proposal to
the Board during its next visit in
May. Although we are pleased and
enthusiastic about these results, it
is important that we remain cau-
tiously optimistic, There is still
much work left to be done to con~
vince the Trustees to begin formal
planning of this building project.
We now must move past the philoV
sophical argument for space and
formally present the specifics of
the p’roposed expansion,

Gaining the Trustees' recognition
ofthe need for space has been one
of our primary goals this year. In
fact, it is a goal we highlighted
throughout our campaigns for of
{ice last spring. This goal, how

ever, did not begin with us. For
more than five years, multi—culr
tural students have attempted to
raise awareness of the need for
space throughout the campus come
munity, The work of these stue
dents cannot be forgotten. We
could not have made our presenr
tation to the Board last week with
out the campus support we inhere
ited. The support which once
arose wrthin the multi-cultural
groups has since expanded to over
540 signatures on a petition which
the Stonewall Coalition circulated
following the Space Rally, an 245%
approval of the SGA Cabinet’s inie
tiative for space, and a silent hu-
man chain extending from the

m SPACE: The Final Frontier?

steps of Main Hall to the Forum.
We would like to thank each of
you for the support you demon»
strated through these actions. In
addition, we would like to recog:
nlze the efforts ofthe students and
administrators whom we serve
with on the Space Committee.
This committee, which met with a
subcommittee of the Board prior
to our presentation, gained allies
on the Board whose support was
critical to the positive response we
received on Friday. We firmly
believe that the greatest reason for
the Trustees‘ positive response
was the unity within the Space
Committee and the widespread
campus support.

Ask Iggy, continued

on what you are serving. I have
heard that red wines are best with
pastas and red meat while white wine
is better if you are sewing fish or
lighter meats, But nothing is ever
that simple is it? Considering your
intentions for the evening and the
typical romantic meal chosen by the
average Grinnell student Iwould rec
ommend something a little more dare
ing than the average red or white. It
has a sharp bouquet and a full body
with a hint of color from the early
frost this year, Have you guessed it
yet? 0k, I’ll tell you- I recommend
“Surge" because if nothing else it
will promote lively conversation.

Dear Iggy:

I am thinking about forming a new
student group: Grinnellians Against
Veganism. It’s notthal I hate vegans,
Ijust think their lifestyle choice is
immoral and in direct conﬂict with
the teachings of the Bible, which
condones and encourages both ani-
mal slaughter and the consumption
ofanimal mcat. I’m sure you are fa-
lniliar with the popular saying: Love
the vegan, hate

the Veganism. And, lest I be in con-
ﬂict with Grinnell’s discrimination
policy, I have decided to allow

vegans to be part of this group--on
the grounds that they renounce their
veganism, take steps to increase their
consumption of meat, and actively
support biblically sanctioned animal
slaughter, Selected relevant Bible
verses will be provided upon request,
What do you think ofmy idea, Iggy?
r—From a devout, just,
God—fearing Flesh Eater

Well, well, well, Flesh Eater,

I think your idea is great, No one
really likes vegans anyway. Why
should our campus cater to thcm‘,7
They are a sign of how we unjustly
privilege minority groups with spe~
cial services. I’m sure there are many
vegans out there who would gladly
join your group so there’s nothing
those crusty old lawyers could do
about it. You have the Bible behind
you, so go for it!

Now you can send
all those questions
you‘ve got bottled
up in your head to
Iggy via email at
her new address
[ASKIGGY] or, as
always, Box 10—14.

Creating a colorblind

BY MOSES MASON
Guest Columnist

For years now I have heard from
many people, white and black, men
and women, Democrats and Repub-
licans that we ought to create a more
colorblind society. Sad to say, 1 re-
ally think that one cannot be created
because no one knows how to do so.
Both of the major political parties
argue that affirmative action is ei-
ther needed, needs revising, or needs
scrapping. This is because affirmar
tive action either creates a more di»
verse society or it judges this nation
based on race and not the content of
one‘s character.

So how do we create a more diverse
atmosphere? Imairitairi that the only
way we can create a colorblind so
ciety is to examine our hearts, fig?
ure out what changes we can make
in ourselves and change. No amp
mative action program or anti-affir-
mative action program will truly
create this society. Without self-ex-
amination, no diversity training pro-
gram is going to create this society.
On a Spiritual level, I know that
God, through
the power of
prayer can
make a dif-
ference. On
a personal
level, it is
coming to
our senses,
recognizing
our faulm and
l e a r n i n g
about each
other that
will ulti-
mately lead
to a more
c 01 o rb l i n d
society.

Is the idea ofa colorblind society a
sin? No, it is not. It is the plan of
God for creation to live together in
peace. On the other hand, to use the
idea in order to get rid of affirma-
tive action and other diversity pro-
grams Without having an alternative
plan is a sin - a sin against God and
against humanity. So, it is obvious
that I am affirmative action advoe
cate. However, I do not believe that
it should exist. No human being
should ever advocate a system that
gives “special preference" (for the
lack of a better term) to people of
color, the disabled, veterans, Women,
etc, But think about it, Why was it
established as the law of the land in
the 1960’s.7 It was done to combat
the affirmative action program that
was established in the 1700’s — White
Male Privilege. This is not my opin-
ion, this is American history.

Here at Grinnell, there is much talk
about diversity on campus, I ap-
plaud this, but at the same time I am
beginning to think that this talk is a
waste of time. It seems to me that
after Freshmen attend the DIVCO
presentation during New Student

Depending on how
you look at it,
aﬁ‘irmative action
either creates a more
diverse society or it
judges thisnation
based on race and not
the content of its

society

Orientation, the issue goes
undiscussed in MANY circles. On
other occasions, people go into a
movie or presentation about race, rac-
ism, and diversity and come out of
the movie crying, emotional and
wanting to save the world. The next
day, or the next week, life is back to
“normal” and the idea that Americans

live “in a more ‘perfect‘ union" be-

comes once more the stams one. The
issue ofdiversity will never come up

again until someone overheats a
white faculty member or a campus

publication refers to me as a
“NIGGER,” an Asian-American as a
“CHINK,” or a HispanicrAmerican

as a “WETBACK/SPIC." Diversity

and race issues Will not get talked

about unless anyone is overheard

refering to all European-Americans

as “HONKEYS" or “RACIS'I'S” and

Jews as ”JEW-BOY" or “CI-IRIST—'
KILLERS.v Need I go further? To

my knowledge, these events have not

occurred on this campus. I only use

these images to make reference to the

only time diversity is discussed.

1 do not want to give the impres-
sion that lam without stereotypes of
E u r o p e a n -
Americans,
A s i a n -
Americans,
H i s p a n i e -
Americans,
etc., because
that is not the
case. I
shamefully
admit that I
do have ste-
r e o ty p i t: all
images of
other races or
people, but at
the same
time I con-
stantly seek
to rid myselfofthem. Are you doing
so? Are you seeking to rid yourself
of the stereotypes that exist about
African-Americans, other European-
Americans, other peoples? If you are, .
are you seeking to rid these attitudes
from your family and friends? Ifso,
it is then that this society can become
more and more colorblind. Ifyou are
not taking these steps, then all the
crap about “living in a more color
blind society” and all of the talks
about promoting diversity is worth
BS (and I do not mean Bachelor of
Science).

Presently, living in a colorblind so-
ciety seems as though it is a dream;
that‘s why I maintain that one prob-
ably cannot be created. Until we find
a way to create one, or until we as
Grinnellians or Americans change
ourselves, then the only thing the ar-
gument “we should live in a more
colorblind society" can be used for
is a way to and those programs which
attempt to create “a more ‘perfect’
union" where “all men [and women]

are created equal"
