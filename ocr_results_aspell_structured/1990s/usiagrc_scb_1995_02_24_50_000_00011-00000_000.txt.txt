team performance.

The men's team defeated favored
Lake Forest 540 . 507 last weekend to
capture the league crown. “It was
really a team effort," Said Coach

weight and everybody scored. It was
an amazing experience "

inanccs.bolllby Nate Brennamen. The
Aleriilerlca diver won both the 3,
iilctcr and lrmeler events and broke
the preVious pool and conference
records in tlte former by better than 80
points. Perhaps the most accurate de-
scription of Brennaman's impressive
showmg came from Obentnller who
labeled it as simply “phenomenal."

Nate is scheduled to give an encore at
the NCAA Division 111 national meet

in March,

Through good teamwork, the P107
