The Grinnell College Volleyball
Club, the Experience, took in a two
day tournament in Cedar Falls, lowa.
last weekend. The United States Vol-
leyball Association (USVBA) sponr
sored the Midwest Regional Touma-
mentin LheUNI—dome on the Univer4
sily of Northem Iowa campus. The
men from Grinnell took the whole
thing.

The champions began play in the
preliminary rounds last Saturday
fairly easily. Playing without star
player Dan Brozowski and team cap»
tain Nathan Timm. the Experience
lost only three games of their four
matches. Grey Gardner. 3 co»captain
for Grinnell, led the team on the court,
setting plays masterfullyThe team
followed Gardner‘s leadership, and
the team came together to make up
for the absence of Timm's strength at
the net The tournament only allowed
two games in preliminary matches,
forcing the Experience to settle for a
split against three of their opponents.
But witil indominatable play in the

third match, they sweptlhe floor with
a team from the University of Iowa.
This pair of wins and solid contribur
tion by the entire team sent Grinnell
to the semi-ﬁnal round the next day.

Grinncll retumedon Sunday, fired
upby theirvictoriesoftheday before,
but focused on the challenge looming
over them. Sunday also heralded the
return of co-captain and doctorrtorbe
Timm to the court. released from the
grips of the MCAT exam. Graceland
faced Grinnell briefly for only two
games. Grinncll won with scores of
15-12 and 15-10 largely due to spec-
tacular solo blocking by sophomore
Brozowski and sevelal others.

This triumph over Graceland
brought the Experience into the final
round of play against Dordt College
of Sioux Center. Gardner continued
his setting success, this Lime with the
benefit of having Timm nearby to
pound in spike after spike for the kill.
Grinnell took the lead in the match by
winning a close ﬁrst game 15-12.

The second game was more heat—
edly contested than the 15-11 score

This phenomenal set capped a beaur
tiful outing for Gardner and earned
him a spot on the All-Toumament
Team, which drew players from all
four brackets of the tournament.

Softball team takes fourth

at Iowa Wesleyan invite

By Alex Severens

When the Grinnell College soft~
ball learn left Florida about two weeks
ago,Coach Lori Sadewaterexpressed
conﬁdence regarding the team’s of-
fensive productivity. However, the
team was matched up against four
NAlA Division ll powerhouses over
the weekend, and the runs which the
teamhadbeenpuuing across theplate
in Florida were not to be found.

The Pioneers were playing at the
Iowa Wesleyan Toumament, which
featured teams from Westminster,
Lindenwood, the College of St.
Mary‘s, and Graceland. The Pioneers
were not able to keep up with the
talent which the biggercolleges show»
cased, and the two day tourney left
the fmstrated learn still searching for
the year's ﬁrst victory.

Although both defenseandoffense
slipped in the weekend‘s four games,
the offense was particularly unpro-
ductive, as the team mustered only
three hits in the four games.
Westminster provided the most difﬁ-
cult challenge to the Pioneer bats.
They ﬁnished 11—!) in three innings
before Grinnell could produce a hit.

Lindenwood handed the learn their
second shutout of the tournament
Freshman Tami Geiger provided the

lone hit for the Pioneers as they
struggled again. Lindenwood was a
14-0 victor in the four-inning game.

College of St. Mary's continued
the shutout with their 15-0 victory.
Nicole Wendt was the sole offensive
provider for the Pioneers, as her hit
was the team’s offensive highlight.

the plate.

The .288 team batting average
which the learn posted in Florida dem~
onstrated thatthe team can hitthe ball
and score runs. However, after the
tournament at Iowa Wesleyan pro
vided only three hits, the average had
dropped to .257. However, offense is
cenainly not the only problem the
young Pioneer team faces. Opposing
team's are hitting .427 against the
club, receiving an average of two
walks per inning.

No team couldpossiblybeasinex-
perienced as the Pioneers are at the
pitching position. First year players.

Andrea Leonard and Emily Parker,
along with Tera Jones, are splitting
time on the mound. With no colle-
giate pitching experience among the
three, the obstacles for the staff are
numerous. “The pitching is slowly
improving,” Coach Sadewater said
after the weekend. “However. we need
to concenualc on reducing the numr
ber ofwalks." Coach Sadewater plans
to continue having the three woman
staff split time unLil someone gets In
a groove.

The home turf will get its first test
of the year,and thePioneers willhave
their ﬁrst ofﬁcial conference game
tomorrow when Knox vislis town.
They then will skip town on Tuesday
to play Cornell and will be back here
on Thursday for a 3:30 start against
Coe.
