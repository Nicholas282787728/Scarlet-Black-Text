Letters

Dear Editor,

Once again our college newspaper
provides evidence that just because
we’re getting educated doesn’t mean
we’re getting smart. The incidents of
vandalism and the act of racist graf-
fiti shown in the November 7th S&B
reflect poorly on a few dumb people.
The jump to inﬂate its importance,
to view itas targeting the school, and
to connect it to town sentiment rer
fleets poorly on the editor of the par
per, the paper itself, and the entire
college community. In other words,
it makes you and me look like a
couple of assholes.

Recap: November 7th. Front page.
The article explains that there have
been “approximately thirty incidents
of vandalism reported," both on and
away from the college campus. Cars,
trucks, and buildings have been dam-
aged—property of both college and
town residean. But rather than an ob»
jective report on some widespread
destruction, the 5&3 makes some ri»
diculous assumptions about the van
dais, the motives, and the commUr
nity attitude through its larger-than-
myrhead photograph and caption.

“The racist grafﬁti is an example of
the animosity a small but prominent
portion of the town directs towards
the college." The fact that this cap-
tion is a quote and opinion ofa single
student is nulliﬁed by its anonymous
placement on the front page of our
paper; now it belongs to all of us.
whether we agree with it or not. Is
this example one of many? What is
small but prominent? All day Saturr
day I heard friends in town laugh
about how they were, could be, or
were considering becoming small but
prominent. All day I was ashamed to
be part of an institution that so care»
lessly judges and offends a whole
town. I would submit that the para»
noid and antagonistic attitude ex-
pressed on the front page of the S&B

is an example of the stupidity aiargeI
but prominent portion of the college'

directs towards the town community.
Stick that in your caption.

In my opinion we are lucky to ate
tend a college in a town like this one.
The range of personalities, beliefs.
and attitudes held by town folk puts
the single-mindedness of Grinnell
College to shame. Most of these
people neither vandalize cars nor
support those that do. Accusing the

town»at-large of this offense is a'

blunder we should strive to avoid in
the future, If anyone needs help ad~
dressmg his or her paranoia, try
walking into town and checking out
the community that surrounds your
bubble. Um...Sorry about the cliche',

MLE Davis '98,

Dear Grinnell College Community,

It is pan of the experience, along
with the normal greetings, discus—
sion, and laughter at meals in the din—
ing halls, that there are always the
mandatory complaints about the
food. Many people find dining food
too greasy, too unappetizing, too
chemical laden, too unfriendly to re-
stricted diets, or too conﬂicting with
their values.

We, the co—op conspiracy, believe
there is a better way. ,

We believe that students, even first
year students, deserve a choice in
what they eat. We believe that
people should be able to choose food
that is not in conflict with their enr
vironmenlal or political view5#f00d
without, or with, animal products,
pesticides, or harvested through
questionable labor practices. Wc
believe people have the right to
choose more palatable food and
cheaper food,

We propose that Grillncll develop a
co-op system as an alternative to the
dining halls in order to attain these
goals. Carops are cooperative food
service arrangements where students
purchase their own food and volunr
teer to prepare their own meals. Selfr
purchasing gives students the ability
to choose what products they buy and
what goes into their bodies. Also,
without the overhead of a largeescale
food factory like Quad or Cowles,
food is cheaper lo produceia save
ings that is passed on to the students,
An added bonus is that the atmo-

to the Editor

sphere of students working together
to provide their meals creates a sense
of community that cannot easily be
replicated in a dining hall.

To those who so desrre, co-ops
would extend beyond just food
preparation. We also advocate a resi-
dential dimension of the co»ops
where all the residents help in food
preparation. Not only would they
learn the essential life skill of cook»
ing, but by working together they
would develop a strong sense ofcomr
munity and start to take more cone
trol over their lives.

These are our beliefs, They are
founded on the very same principles
of self-governance on which this
school stands. You will probably be
hearing a lot more about them as we
try to develop a cerop movement
here at Grinnell, and we hope we will
have your support,

Sincerely.
The Co-op Conspiracy

RS. Please do not be alarmed at
the conspiracy in ‘Corop Con-
spiracy,’ we just wanted the same
thing in a name that we want in our
food—a little bit of flavor,

Hey Grinnell College: It’s time to
wake up, AIDS has hit our commur
nity.

Almost one month ago a fellow
Grinnell College student revealed to
me—in complete confidenceihis/
her HIV positive status (the person
has granted me permission to write
this). Yes, you heard me right,
Hlvil-iuman Immunodeficiency
Virus. You know, the disease that
effects everybody else, certainly not
our isolated, elite institution nestled
in the rural heartland Well welcome
to the 1990s We are not immune

We are not special 'We can get my '

and now one of usithztt I know off,
has. Yes, this person could be your
neighbor, could sit next to you in
class, could compete with you in
your sport, could share your meals
with you... this person could be
standing there with you right now as
you’re reading this article. Yes, this
person could have been one of your
late night drunken llings or even your
signiﬁcant other, How does it feel?
Are you nervous? I think you should
be.

I too, once thought that I was im—
mune, until I watched my boyfriend
ofsix years die ofAIDS two Christ-
mases ago. I watched this once
strong healthy man Wither away to
nothing. Ibathed hisshrunken body,
changed his condom catheter, dis-
pensed his drugs, wiped his sweat:
ing brow, and comforted him as
much as I could. And I was there
when he took his ﬁnal breaths. Have
you ever personally known anyone
who died olAIDS‘? Do you? Do you
care?

I’m angry. Yet another person that
Icare forts afﬂicted with HIV. And

I’m tired of tlptoeing around the is ,

suc. I‘m tired of hiding behind the
shroud of Silence. We don’t really
talk about anything on this campus
that makes us slightly uncomfortable,
that openly lhrctttcns our comfonable
existence “Oh, AIDS, yes that’s sad.
I'll wear n i-cd ribboll and join the
brigade." But AIDS its more than a
red ribbon, Perhaps you heard that
slognn at tllc recent AIDS benefit
which GEAR organized. But was the
beneﬁt really that much more than a
red ribbon? I helped plan it, and I
don't really thiltk so. We. the bunch
of privileged kids that we are, just
gave money away like some philan—
thropic organization No doubt the
money is helpful, but is doesn’t rc-
ally address the problem,

And what is the problem? Us You,
Me. Grinnell students, faculty, and
staff. The people in town, anti in
Iowa, and in tllc nation, and the
world. Many of us are living a lie,
pretending that it won’t happen to us,
Well, it has and will continue to un-
less we do something about it, To
begin with, oursexual practices have
to change We cannot just sit back
and watch it happen to everyone else.

We are not playing with money. We
am playing with our lives.

This college has n long history of
commitment to social Justice and
raising moral awareness, II is long
past time that we overcome our ba-
nality ofsilencc and begin once again
to engage one another in confrontr
ing the AIDS epidemic.

Iwould like to hold an informal dis—
cussion group about HIV/AIDS. If
you are interested in participating
please VAX me at [Conrad],

Thank you,
Erin Conrad ’98

A Discouraging Fall

I have always liked to look at the
world as a metaphor. I look at my
environment and ask how it corre»
sponds with the events in my own
head, or my own life. I have watched
the tallest and Wisest trees in my
neighborhood felled by strong winds
bzick home, I have seen the newspa»
per photos ofthe mass forest fires in
Southeast Asia, and this fall I have
wunessed our own campus groves
snap under the wind and pressure of
Iowa weather. Much of the old
growth is gone, leaving us exposed
and barren. For comfort. I remind
myself that there is new room for
new growth, but I’m anxious about
the new era, Like the rest of the
world, Grinnell is in a state ofchange
and upheaval, and we need to care-
fully watch the new growth to see
that it ﬁlls in for the old growth in a
healthy way.

Our school has been in a state of
expansion {or this whole decade; at
least, economic and structural
growth. So why do so many students
feel stifled? Grinnell has always pror
moted itself as a school that wants
its students to take some control over
their own educations and the school
itself, Y’know, selfrgovernance and
all that, But is that true? Do you
feel more free to get the kind ofedu—
cation you want, learning the things
you feel you need to move on? For
my ﬁrst few years. I think I would
have said yes. But I‘ve been listen-
ing to the low rumble of discontent
on campus this year and I believe
what I hear, I t nk the system of
sch-governance is breaking down, if
it was ever working like it was sup
posed to. Ithink the causes are two
fold: 1) Very few students have air
ther the time or the motivation to
devote time and energy to action outa
side of their schoolwork; 2) The ad-
ministration at this school is not as
concerned about our agendas as they
would like us to believe. I Will say
only a few things to fellow students,
but 1 am mostly writing to criticize
the administration. because I am
more disappointed in them than I am
in us.

Students, it is worth our time to
express our opinions about the way
this college works, about current
events, about the things we care
about. We all get exhausted, but
don't we thrive on challenges and
pride ourselves on success? Don’t
forget that classroom achievements
are only rhetorical successes; they
don't have their full impact until we
can apply them to our lives and oth»
ers. If you have something to say,
say it! Even lfyou only write an e»
mail to Tom Crady, et al, or discuss
something in our newspaper or any
newspaper with a friend, exercising
your opinion is healthy for you and
this campus. And try to listen to sine
dents when they express themselves
Too often at this school we jump to
conclusions and make judgments
without trying to understand each
other. Give a friend—and especially
those who are not your fritmdsithe
beneﬁt ofthe doubt. That is how we
can learn and grow as a community.
There are too many things wrong
with the administration to be bicker-
inganlongstoursclves. Enough On
to the administratioii..,

Why is it that at a “selfrgoverning”
school, numerous changes have been
made to the campus without the con-
sent or initiative ofthe students? For
example. why are there now two new
kinds of locks in the dorms, when
one of them does the job of both?
Correct mc irl am wrong, but I be
Iieve that the electronic locks were
installed in response to an alleged
sexual assault last year, If so, has
anyone noticed that the electronic
locks would have done nothing to
help prevent or investigate that al-
leged crime? I don’t mind the indi»
vrdual room locks (although we al-
ready had locks on our doors) be-

cause I can be in control of my own
security, and they Will prevent un-
wanted entrance. But the electronic
locks add nothing to our safety ex»
cept a Big Brother account of our
comings and goings. Why is that
necessary? I would really like to
know, I have nothing to hide, but I
feel more uncomfortable than I did
before the electronic locks. I want
to feel safe at Grinnell like anybody
else, but safety and security are not
always equivalent.

Or how about the way the tree cut-
ting was handled after the strong
winds on parents’ weekend? One
member of our administration was
present as a small group of students
argued with the tree doctor about the
fate of some of south campus’s most
beloved trees, but I am convinced
that nothing would have happened
different if he were not there. He said
nothing to the students about how
they could get involved, he did not
represent the concerns of the students
whose position was clearly being
presented right in front of him, and
made no effort to explain how the
bureaucracy of this school works in
that kind of situation. All he did was
make jokes. Wasn‘t he supposed to
be working with and for the Stu»
dents}?! The administration has obe
viously lost contact with the stue

ldents.

These are only recent events. The
minority space issue has been on the
table for years now with no sufﬁcient
response from the administration.
Perhaps they don’t feel that the stu
dents have been persistent enough
about this issue. If so, we will get
louder. Would a protest be convinc-
ing enough? It shouldn’t have to
come to that. [just can’t understand
why no solid plans have been made
to accommodate the wishes of
Grinnell’s minority students, The
endowment has grown and the school
is expanding, so why can‘t we ex»
pand with the guidance and help of
the students? I don't object to the
new science building or the new Fine
Arts building, but I don’t recall stu-
dents asking for those, The one thing
students did want out ofthe new ﬁne
ans building was aphotography lab,
but that will not be a part of the new
building, And how I’he’ar'th‘a‘t'a’c‘eni'
tral dining hall has been proposed.
Preposterous! Meanwhile. minority
students are screaming for a space
of their own and the administration
is turning their back.

The students have a right to know
what the goals and intentions of the
college are. It occurred to me re

cently that Grinnell is a business. '

And because it is a private institue
tion, the administration has the right
to do whatever they want with the
college and go in any direction they
want. But they must remember that
the students are paying to come here,
and that creates a responsibility on
behalf of the administration to listen
to and support our needs. If Grinnell
wants to change its image, I suppose
they have that right, but it IS their duty
to communicate their intentions as a
school to the students, A college is
neither made up ofonly an adminis—
tration or a student body; they create
a whole together. The administra—
tion needs the cooperation of the stue
dents to deﬁne itself in any way.
Lately, the feeling on campus is one
of suspicion. There are too many
unanswered questions. Why hasn’t
there been progress in the minority
space issue? What are the circuln»
stances of Pam Ferguson‘s resignar
tion? I am not the first to ask these
questions. What is the administrate
tion afraid of revealing? Ifthere are
not answers soon, this college is go
ing to lose all the things that made it
different than other liberal arts cola
leges, 2i supported and encouraged
student initiative.

We do not attend Grinnell to be
manipulated for prestigious statistics,
Bringing students to this school with
a false sense of what the college
stands for is immoral, Does the bror
churc tell racial minority students
that they Will be divided across camr
pus to give a “multicultural” experir
ence to the white students? Does it
say that although there are no “re-
quired” classes outside of your ma-
jor you may suffer debilitating red

tape if you are not well rounded; fret)“

enough? Probably not that would
be bad for business, But so is admit-
ting students who don't share the
administration's visioil for the future
of Grinnell.

I do not trust the administration at

OPINION

this college anymore, and I want to
know what their intentions are‘ l!

Sincerely.

Dear Tom Crady,

I have heard through the grapevine
that the committee to review presi-
dential candidates will be small, con-
sisting of one or two students. I am
writing to urge that students be al-
lowed to have two students to repre-
sent us in this committee. Also, I
think that it is important that one of

these students be selected from out- '

side the organization of the SGA.
SGA, as the governing body of stu-
dents represents many of our con-
cerns and interests, and I have faith
in the leaders of this organization.
However, the fact remains that the
SGA leaders in general share asingle
perspective and single voice. There
fore, I feel that two representative:
both from SGA would not address
many ofthe concerns on campus that
don’t go directly through this orga-
nization. I would like to see repre-
sentation extended to someone se»
lectcd from the other side ofcampus
life. Concretely this means someone
who will represent the interests of
minorities, express concerns about
diversity, and be willing to raise some
of the perhaps notesovcomfortable,
but vital questions regarding the in-
terests of this school as a residential
liberal arts college devotcd to diver»
sity and multiculturalism. I believe
it is in the interests ofthe students as
a whole to have a voice not only from
the established governing organiza-
tion, but also from many of the
people who have been working be-
hind the scencs to see through many
of the difficult issues on race, gen-
der, and GLET equality on campus.
[ask you to take all student interests
into account in determining student
input on the committee.
ThankYou,

Kate Jones ‘99

Dear Editors of the 5&3.

We, the members of Grinnell’s

chapter of Amnesty Intemational. are
writing in response to Lizz
Westman’s article in the October 10
issue of the 3&3, in which she criti-
cized Amnesty International. We
understand that it is easy to be cyni-
czil when faced with so many issues
that need attention, and it may seem
pointless to write letters for some-
one so faraway and seemingly
doomed, However, there is over-
whelming evidence that we do make
a difference. Just one example of this
can be found in the testimony ofSari
Nusseibeh, a former political pris-
oner:
”I cannot find the proper words to
express my gratitude for the interest
you have taken in my case and the
solidarity which you have expressed.
Inside a prison cell, such support is
invaluable. Above all, it reinforces
one‘s faith in what is human in a situ-
ation that seems shockingly inhu-
man,,,"

So, while the signatures ofyou and
four hundred other students from
”bumblefuck Iowa" may seem insig-
nificant, to political prisoners they
mean everything, because it's not
only those 400 students, it‘s people
from China. India, England, and
Amnesty chapters all over the world.
It doesn't take much for each of us
to sign his or her name, but it adds
up to show violators of human nghis
that people are watching.

Finally, we would like to address
her comment that “our school can be
just as terrible as the rest of the
World," While Grinnell does have its
problems, we're pretty sure that most
people would rather eat bad dining
hall food than be kidnapped, tortured.
and raped,

If you have any questions or com-
ments , please feel free to vax [AM-
N'ESTY].

Sincerelyi
Amnesty International, Grinnell
