Grinnell ACM scholars
discuss summer research

By Tara Ncavins

Last summer, senior Marie

' Myers and junior Angela Orange,

were selected for the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest (ACM)
Scholars Program, Both chose
projects of interest to them and
which related to their particular
majors. Each then asked a faculty
member to serve as theirmentor for
the duration of the project.

Two students from each ACM
college were chosen to participate
in the program, which is designed
primarily as an independent re-
search program. Applicants were
chosen based on their academic
standing, project proposal, essay,
and other factors.

Theonlyformalrequircments
of theprogram were thatstudents
attend both the initial confer-
ence held at the University of
Chicago this year and the final
meeting at which papers were
presented which occurred on
Grinnell's campus in mid-Oc-
tober.

Participants in the ten-week
program made individual ar—
rangements for iood and board
although they received two
thousand dollars to help meet
theseexpensesandanadditional
four hundred dollars for travel ex-
penses when necessary. Students
also made individual arrangements
as to when they would meet with
their mentors.

Myers, an American studies
major with an African studies cone
ccntration. researched the “Tragic

'Mulattn in New Orleans‘ Society

and Literature”. For hcrprojectshe
intended to enrich her study by
going to New Orleans to do one
location research with her adviser,
Associate professor of American
Studies Kesho Scott.

However, both became ill and
decided tocancel this tripand make
the project more historically ori-
ented. thus allowing greater use of
library research. Myers kept in
touch with Scottby telephone since
she remained at home in Kansas
City, Missouri during the majority
of the ten»week period. She was
helped by a strong background in-
terest in the subject.

“I had done a lot of reading on
the subject, and it sounded really
cool," said Myers. “1 think that you
have to think of something you
really want to do. " Shealso stressed
how her own experiences made
current research papers scem much
easier and more fun.

Since her internship, Myers has
found “at least five other things"
she would now like to study in
depth. The project, in her estima-
tion, put her in the mindset to find
potential topics she would have
simply overlooked before. She ad-
mitted that she now looks very dif-
tercntly at topics, and approaches
them with greater understanding
and excitement.

“There was a real racial mixture
of people in the program," said
Mycrs. Oneofthcmain goals ofthe
program is to encourage minority
students to pursue academic ca-
reers and to continue on to graduate
school and other higher education.
This was accomplished through “the
many speeches heard at the Univer-
sity of Chicago" in additonal to the
research itself,

On the negative side, Myers felt
it “would have been nicer to have
more time to socialize with the other
participants in Chicago.

“We only had one night to get to
know them. learn about the pro
gram in greater detail, and discuss
preliminary plans,” she added, cau-

"If you like research,
it’s great. Even if you
don’t, it'.\' more than just
pure research and inter-
views. You can do any-
thing that interests
you."

--Marie Myers

tioning also that “people should be
aware that ACM doesn't tell you
exactly what to do.”

“it you go to New York to do
research," added Myers. “you
probably will not sec your advisor
at all." She also emphasized how
important it was to choose a topic
you are really intrigued by and how
much more fun and rewarding the
resulting experience will be.

Overall, Myers was impressed
with the ACM project and was
grateful for how receptivc and

helpful Scott was in pursuing the
preject.

“It’s really important to have an
adviser who’s going to encourage
youtodothings,"said Myers. Acar
demically, she believed that “the
program fit tn well with her major
and concentration". She added that
it was related to her career aspira-
tions: to teach in higher education
in American or African-American
studies. She also highly recom-
mended the ACM project.

“Iiyou like research, it's great,"
said Myers. ”Even ifyou don’t, it‘s
more than just pure research and
interviews. You can do anything
that interests you."

Orange, the other Grinnell par-

ticipant, ﬁrst became aware of

the program whcn her adviser
told her about it after she spent
three weeks during the winter
interim on an eight-credit study
tour in Russia a year ago. Or-
an ge, a Russian major also said
that the ACM project was “tied
in with“ her major, and was ex»
tremely beneficial and reward»
ing.
l-lcrcxperience in Russiaover
the break helped to rekindle her
iniercstin Russian literature. For

to work closely with her mentor,
John Mohtin. She also met for the
first time many other students who

with them a real sense of

Des Moines children
taste life at Grinnell

By Helene Eisenman

Elementary schoolstudcntsirom
DesMoinesarcgctting a chance to
see what college life is all about
through a new Grinnell College
supported program. The ] [lave a
Dream program, run by the 1 Have
a Dream Foundation, is designed
to encourage children to stay in
school and to teach them are value
of education.

The students
involved in the
program gcncrr
ally are from
underprivileged
homes which
create many ob-
stacles to con-
tinuing an alur
cation. Those students in the pro-
gram who go on to graduate from
high school are guaranteed intan-
cial assistance (based on the 19897
1990 tuition for the Univ. of Iowa)
to continue their education. The
money can be used for any “rcpue
table" educational experience the
students would like.

There are currently 135 classes
throughout the U.S.enrolledin the
program. However, most of these
classes are not exposed to college
as the Des Moines SlxthrgmdBIS
are. Grinnell is the only institution
ofits kind that has adopted a class
to visit the college on a regular
basts.

BycomingtoGrmncll,thc chili
drcn are given an opportunity to
meet collcgc students of various
backgrounds and to sec what a
college is l|kC. It is also intended to
providcaiurthcrincentivcforthem
to go to college. The Des Moincs
students visited Grinnell on Suture
day, February 2nd and will come
twice more this semester, with the
possibility of an oven-light stay.

Children can meet col-
lege students of various
backgrounds and see
what the college is like.

Saturday’s visit was typical of
what is in store. in the moming the
childrcnztrrivcxlattthorthlAaungC
of the Forum, They spent a few
minutes there eating breakfast,
looking around and going into the
pool room before going to “class."

During the morning, the elm
cmentary students attended classes
in Art, Theatre and PhySlcs. Each
child chose two of these that they
wished to attcnd. In Art, they were
given materi-
als to create
designs as
they listened
to music.
Theatre con-
sisted of a se—
ries of cxcrr
cisesin which
the children did movements alone,
then with a panner. They also got a
chance to try improvizing with
their partners. In Physics, the stu-
dents were shown experiments
involving angular momentum.

Before lunch, some of the chili
drenrlislened to a tape oi theme
selves on KDIC which wasrccorded
last semester. They also had a
chance to walk around campus and
to look at the displays in the Sci-
ence Building. All of the children
all: lunch at Quad, taking full ad-
vantage of the ice cream machine.

The rest of the day was spent
