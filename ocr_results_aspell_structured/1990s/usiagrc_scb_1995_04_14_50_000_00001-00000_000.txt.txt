THE PROTEST

Friday morning began with min
nority students wearing black, plac—
ingtapcovcrthelrmouthsand wears
ing signs which explained that they
were protesting the racial tensions
which they claimed were escalating
on Campus, Many students were
both shocked and offended by the
demonstration. which was notwidely
understood.

Confusionaboutthcpurposcand
motivation ofthe protest was cleared
at a Speak Bitter the evening ofthe
demonstration. Minority students
spoke while students, faculty and
administration listened quietly.

Among the complaints voiced
was the pressure on minority stun
dents to repeatedly take responsibilr
ity for educating the community
about their background and culture,
This burden should be placed more
on the student who needs informa
tion. Minority students should not
each be expected to continually rep-
resent their entire race or culture,
they said.

This problem has led to the eie

haustion of minority students who
are forced to take on this leadership
role, they claim. They explained
that the placement oftape over their
mouths was symbolic of their re-
fusal to continue in this role.

This role also creates the feel-
mg of being an “add-on” to the aca—
dcmiccurriculum. Minority classes
zire also viewed as “add-ons” by
many students, faculty members and
administrators. It was demanded at
the Speak Bitter that this attitude be
changed.

The use of tape was also we
plained as representing “the failure
of the administration, some faculty
and some stuff [to] not recognize
[their] needs," which silences them.
said a statement distributed at lhc
Speak Bitter. The tape also forced
whiteselhnicstudentstotalk amongst
themselves about the problem rather
than turning to minority students for
information and answers.

“[T]oday we exercise our right
notiospeak—insteadofbeiiigforced
to speak and survive the increas-
ingly tense and uncomfortable cul-

tural climate at Grinnell College."

Other problems spelled out at
the meeting were the failure to enact
the African-American Studies con-
centration (which they said only ex-
ists on paper), faculty relying on
minority members to teach
multicultural classes, lack of
multicultural spaces for groups and
the lackofa forum in which to speak
out and be taken seriously on cam—
pus.

“Race seems like aproblem, not
a badge of honor," asserted one
speaker.

RACIAL INCIDENCES

Two incidents which contrib-
uted to the escalation of racial ten-
sions which were both mentioned at
the Speak Bitter were an incident at
a basketball game where students
used racial slurs and the suspension
of two DJs from KDIC after they
usedthe words“b*tch"and“n*gger”
on the air.

“It was unfortunate that it had to
happen, but we felt it was in the best
general," said Charlie Clark, admin-

felt that if a focus or main point
could be found for the celebration, it
could be summed up in what the two
politicians represent. New doors are
opening for GLB‘s, and a level of
honesty and acceptance that
wouldn’t have existed in the past is
beginning to be possible.

“The speakers we have coming
will be powerful reminders of what's
