The Cook, the Thief,
His Wife and Her
Lover: Emotional

TableauX and Risks

By Danellc Baker

It seems that Peter Greenway
overturned the stone of cinematic
complacency in his newest creation,
a dramatic black comedy so beau-
tiiul. one is tell speechless, unable
iocommunicateitsimpactin words.
In rooms richly monochromatic,
bound tightly with a haunting muV
sical score, Greenway filmed The
Cook, the Thief. His Wife and Iler
Lover. and, it seems, has success»
fully pulled the industry of film-
making back into the realm of art-
istry.

The plot of The Cook is left so
strikinglysimple.itisnearlyabare-
bones structure for the delicate in-
tensity of cinematography and
music to rest amply upon. Albert
Spica. played by Michael Camcon,
is a restaurateur and husband so
barbaric, his twisted perceptions oi
food and sexuality can aptly be
described as vomitous,

British actress Helen Minen is
his battered and submissive wife
Georgina, oxymoronic in her dual
Victimization and spiritual freedom.
Mitren's performance is textured
and ﬂawless. Her ability to Com-
municate wilhoutwords transmutes
mindless sex with a stranger into
something precious, a ﬂedgling
love within a lavatory stall. It is the
pursuit of this secrecy within the
bondsofAlben's cavemousFrench

restaurant, “Le Hollandais.” that
tlims Georgina‘s brutal reality and
multiplies Albert’s ragc, a painful
challenge to observe.

Though The Cook is notorious
foraudlence walkouts,thcphysicnl
beauty is mindrboggling at times.
magical in its consistency.
Georgina‘s dresses are Chameleon
like. the colors altering from room
to room. Each room in “Le
Hollandais" is cast in one hue, and
the cinematography is such that the
screen seems a moving portrait.

Yetonly after carefully pushing
back the film‘s vilenessare these at
a conscious level. Albert is Hanson
ating anti torturous. He drags
Georginn‘s former lover to the
lowest of indignities in the first
scene, only a hint as to the
treatment of Michael, her lover of
“Le Hollandais." He publicly
fondles and humiliates Georgina,
yet is broken to tears with
knowledge of her infertility and
infidelity. Ultimately she socks re»

play of a battered woman's private
lust

Roger and Menu"

December 7, 1990

Roger and Me ts Michael Moore's highly personalized 1939 documentary account oithc demiscofFllrlt, Michigan.
in the wake ofGM‘s pullout, Moore‘s sneaky. gloating. impeccably docu-inairc bias is as citcn objectionable as it is
wryly amusing. but the scenes of families being thrown out of their homes are real. and are calculated to wrcnch tltc
heart ofeven thc most ardent {room-ureter. For better or for Worse. this mellowryetrdevaslaling film is destined to
bc a minor classic, and is well worth your timc.

The Love Bug- --

The Love Bug is a corny and slapstick»packed cult classic. The Star of this iilrn (which was released from Disney in
1969) is a Volkswagen Bug named Herbie. Herbie is a most unusual car. as it can drive itself and do pretty much
anything it wants. Besides llcrbia. Buddy Hackett is thc most notable actor in this ﬁlm.

Death Stumbles as Black Comedy

By Danelle Baker

In an ethnorsuburban black
comedy,directorlawrence Kasdan
has assembled an allrstar cast that
succeeds in the ludicrous. but
stumbleselsewhcre. Itileove You
to Death—silly in ils extremities.
yet falling short of the togethemess
that composes a singular work.

Kevin Kline is Joey Becca, a
hilarious caricature of the Italian
stallion governed solely by hor-
mones. He is a machine that sur-
vivcs with little sleep, bouts of
ethnic gorgmganda variety of mid-
day trysts. His wife, Rosalie, an
earthy and giving Tracey Ullmun
void of thc Br' ish ltll, is naive.
blind to Joey's infidelitics. When

she happens upon him in action,
pressed against a statuesque red-
head between two library shelves,
her grief swiiuy evolves into re-
venge, The homespun remedy for
Joey. sleeping pills and spaghetti
sauce. fails. and she is thus forced
to find another mechanism for
elimination. Twoamateurhiunen,
Manson-esque bumouts played by
William Hurt and Keanu Reeves,
are assigned to the completion of
Joey’s death, and bunglc the msk
uproariously.

l Lave You to Death is studded
with fragmented bits of notewor-
thy performances, both the com-
mendablc and the poor. In con-
trast to his work in Children ofa
Lesser God and The Accidental

Tourist and Kiss of the Spider
Woman, Hurt is nearly unrecogniz—
able, the polar opposite of his Iypi~
cal “Sensitive Man" role.

RiverPl'loenix is shaky asDevo.
the adolescent with the notrsoado-
lcscent crush on Rosalie, and
Ullman herselfgraspsatsomeform
ofrealism. yet frequently misses in
the violent sway of emotion that
her role calls for. Most promising
is the character of Natlja, Rosalie’s
dead-pan mother and Yugoslavian
Mrs. Fixit.

The choms of characters rings
true until the turning point, when it
seems that the “black" in black
comedy is too distant a goal—the
comedy is not of pure tonality
throughout.
