A Chorus of Angels?

and justice on theirsitle. A chorus of
angels sings in the backgtound,

one would think that spending
a semester discussing these items
would leave a person refreshed and
renewed. giving him or her the tools
and drive to act nonyiolently for the
betterment of humanity. A sen-ii—
Eiiplioric state Wlll be reached with
the knowledge that one can help
those in suffering. those in poverty,
those in oppression. through sit.ins
and marches, civil disobedience and
meditation, Again, a chorus of an.
gels sings in the background.

I. however, can't make these
grandiose claims. When I leave that
classroom every Monday and
Wednesday, my head hurts. I run as

things connected to Theologies of
Nonviolence. I don‘t want to hear
the names Thomas Merton, Dotthy
Day. Thich Nhat Hanh, Mahatma
Gandhi, Desmond Tutu, Martin

of prorests and blood spillings. lus—

and “the redemptive quality ofsuf<

genuine concern ohout horh parties
involved in a conilict draws respect
and an increased willingness to work
on a resolution.

But our work transcended the
classroom. Every student in the class
visited the Catholic Worker house in
Des Moines to experience one kind of
work that nonviolent activists engage
in,ThecatholicWorkerisanendear—
or that was started by Dorothy Day, an
advocate of the rights of the working
class and a woman who brought dignis
ty hack to being a Catholic in the
middle decades of this century, The
Catholic iiorker houses pioride com.
munities with a safe house where meals
and rooms are provided to those who
need them. The volunteers who work
arthemliveinintentionalpoverniand
are more than willing to break a law
that they feel is uniiist, even ii that
means going to rail (which they oireii
do).

I ielt good doing some physical
lahor ior reasons l could be proud oi
and enioyed the chance to eat a meal
with the people I was helping. You
can't really help people that you don't
interact with. When the day was over
I could see similar volunteer work in
my itirurc.

The question remained: Do i
wanrrochoosenonvioleiiceasaniiire—
gral part of my his, or is it just some.
thing that I'm interested in because of
the classi I got my answer when l
started noticing how often 1 ivas relate
mg what I had learned to the events in
my everyday life. I was particularly
struck with the way pcoplcdidn'tmnke
an effort to understand other people
with whom they were having a prob

tloned. I mentally cover my cats.

Whyi Why don't I want to hear
these prophetic messages calling ior
me to play my rolei Because then I
have to answer them, I have to take
them seriously and look at what part
they play in my lite, and that is an
incredibly ditiiciilt thing to do. The
questions raised in this class are not
easy: What is true nonviolencez Is
suffering necessary to fight injustice?
Why is nonviolcnce such a helittled
veice in our world as a means of
conﬂict resolutionICannonviolence

perspective, or does nonviolent ac.

these issues to rhe forefront of my

For me. it comes down to faith.

Uncomfortable and Offensive"

EY AARON Gnoss

studying some ofthe great non—
violent activists and thinkers oi the
modern era has been extremely die
tressing and, for that very reason, it
has heen an invaluable experience.
There is an old story otaRahhi in an
Eastern European Shtetle who was
accosted on his daily walk by a soL
drer. “Who are you'l" the soldier
barked, “and what are you doing
hotel?" The Rabbi was shocked at
ﬁrst.butaitersomethotightheturned
to the soldier, “How much are you
paid to do your Job?" he queried, “5
kopeks," was the curt reply. “I’ll pay
you 10 kopeks iieachdoy you will ask
me those same questions."

The writings of Gandhi, King,
Day, Merton, and Nhat Hanh have
been for me a series otaecusing sol<
diets These nonviolentactivists have
sometimes spoken soirly and kindly,
hut rheir soft words have made a
heavy impression. As 1 have read
themIni‘TheologlcsofNonvlolence"
and over the years, they have chalr
lenged me to reevaluate my assump»
tions about human nature, the hue
mun—animaltelationship,andhumon
responsibility

More immediately though, they
have challenged my daily li the
meat that once was on my dinner
plate;myhabitofbuyingnewclothes,
a co, or whatever commodity while
mysisrers and brothctsitiothetcoun—
tries—or even other citiesehave
gone hungry. They have challenged
me to activism, but not merely to
activism. They have demanded thar
as I work to reduce violence, I do so
with compassion and respect tor the
oppressor as well as rhe oppressed.
Even more, they have asked me to
recognize then ays in whichI am “the
oppressor" and then they have de
manded that I work tuirously at the
nontrivial task of washing my own
hands of the violence,

 

Over theyears my encounter with
the greatnonviolentaetivrsrshasheen,
more than anything else, UNCOM-
FORT/\BLE. King argues that the job
of a nonviolent activist is to point our
and highlight the hidden tensions in
sociery and then to increase the level
oi tension until society is toiced to
change. As I have read the writings of
nonviolent activists like King. they
have created a tension in me that has
impelled me to activism and personal
growth.

At Gtinnell we are made uncom.
fortable; often thrs diseorntort leads to
positive ethical changes in our lives. I
have seen many people enter Gtinnell
as homophohes, misogynisrs, or higors
and leave with a turn commitment to
eradicate such preiudices irom their
lives However, many here feel thar it
is wrong tor anyone to make them
iincomiortahle. If a poster is put up
with which they disagree, iia view is
asserted rhat doesn't jibe with their
political (or othet) orientation, these
people explain that they are “offend-
cd," and that they shouldn’t have to
see such posters or hear such views.
such people would not have enioyed
“Theologles ofNonviolence.”

As i see it, one important goal of
a liberal arts education should he to
broaden rhe stiideiirs‘ outlook so that
they see a full range of possible life—
paradigms, and thus treely choose the
types oi’lives they want to live. lfyou
will pardon a little rhetoric. the goal of
n liheral education should hero onend
us, We must have our sensibilities “of—
fended” so that we may recognise that
thereareotherwaysoilivingandthink.
ing, perhaps even better ways.

“Theologles ofNoiwiolence" has
been one oi the most oiiensive courses
I have taken here at orinnell and tar
that reason, it has been one oithe best.
Thevoicesoitheacrivisrsandthinkers
we’ve read in this course have followed
me around aiter class, constantly procl—

ding and questioning me. When I
stand in line at Fairway groceries)
Gandhi's voice echoes in my head:
“We should be ashamed of resting or
having asouare meal so long as there
is one able—bodied man or woman
without work or food." When I have
worked to educate people about the
suEtering caused in meat production,
thewotdsofNahtHanhhaveweighed
on me: “it we divide reality into two
coinpsethe violent and the nonvio—
lent—and stand in one camp while
attacking the other, rhe world will
neverhavepeace,"Whenlhave been
in a cynical mode, doubting that hu.
mans have rhe capacity to live in
peace,Mertouhas\varnedme:”NoLh»
mg can hotter dispose us for a third
world war than the conviction that
we are doomed to fight anyway." As a
whole. the class has asked me two
basic questions: “Who are you?" and
"What are you doing here?"

These questions have trans—
lated into thousands of smaller more
immediate questions: Do I buya new
shirt, or do I donate the money to a
homeless shelterz Do I spend the ext
tra few hours on my homework, or do
1gotutoringarrheelernentaryschool
in Marshallrown.7 Do I go [0 Gradu»
are school after Grinnell or do I work
at a nonproﬁt otgnnizatlon doing
serviceiThe questions the course has
raised for me have been difficult at
times because often the answer that
seems right is not the answer that is
easy or comiortable. I have tried to
embrace the discomtorr and do what
I can. I have strived to, as Proiessor
Lanzetta describes it, “bear the ten.
sion” between the ideally nonviolent
lite andthellft:thnrtealltyconstmms

so long ago "It is not your obligation
to complete the task [of mending the
world], but neither are you free to
desist [from doing all you canl.”
