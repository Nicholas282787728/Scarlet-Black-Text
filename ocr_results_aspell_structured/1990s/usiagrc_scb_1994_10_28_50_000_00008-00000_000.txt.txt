New style for Orchestra in Musicale

By AMANDA

HORNBUC KLE
Ans Editor

HIS Sunday. October 30. in
the Forum’s South Lounge,
the Grlnnell Orchestra will

be providing a slightly different con-
cert than whatmost of its audience is
used to. With the Musicale, instead
of performing as an entire group. the
orchestra will present pieces from
various small ensembles.

The Musicale, billed as a “Feast
of Music." has been an annual event
for the past few years. Another my
usual twist to the concert is its loca-
tion. According to Orchesua direc-
tor Jonathan Knight, since the con-
certis held in the more relaxed South
Lounge, there is more of an informal
atmosphere, because players and au-
dience members interact in between
pieces “as they gather around the
refreshment table."

Knight sees numerous beneﬁts
from the concert‘ 5 nontraditional ar-
rangement. “For the orchestra mem-

bers,rehearsing for the Musicale pro-
vides an opportunity to work in
smaller units so that individual play-
ers cart polish their ensemble playing
skills while getting to know one an-
other better. For the audience, the
type of concert program that results
from splitting the orchestra members
up in various ways provides a variety
of rather unusual instrumental com»
binatjons,” he said.

This year‘s program contains
music for brass alone, strings alone
and Woodwinds alone as well as
smaller combinations of instruments

such as a quintet for four woodwind
instrumentsand one brass (theFrench
horn), a quintet for ﬂute and four
string instruments,andaduo for ﬂute
and piano,

Knight is anticipating the event,
saying, “I'm particularly excited with
the musical selections on this year's
concert, The most well»knownpiece
wewillplay isunquestionably Sartruel
Barber’sAdagio forStrings; but other
selections by great composers such
asGabrieliand Mounrepresentsome
of their most pleasing and memo-
rable music as well."

meeting to find outiftherewas inter-
est in starting a team again, but after
the meeting involvement died out.
This year, Kara Heitz and Emily
Berg], two sophotnores with cxtcnr
sive high school experience, decided
to try to resurrect the team again.

"I felt that there really wasn’t
any other activity like forensics on
campus, one that allowed people to
compete in speaking and inlcrprelzh
tioncventsasindividuals," Bergl said.
“We wanted to give that opportunity
tothestudents." Thetwoknew many
people had been involved in foren»
sics in high school, and that,judging
from the turnout at the meeting last
year, there was definite interest. So
far about 15 people have come to
weekly meetings and are preparing
material for tournaments.

Theﬁrstmeettheteamwillattend
is on December at perennial forensics

Chicago &

powerhouse University of Nonhcm
Iowa. Currently, there are three olhcr
tournaments performers are planning
to go to scattered throughout the win-
ter and spring months. There is also

sorcampus events, such asreadings of
poetry and prose interpretations. in the
near future. “We want to take this in
diffemnt directions, and get involved
in things o1her than just the touma-
merits," Bergl stated.

The forensics team meets every
Wednesday at 4:15 pm. in Steiner

our previous experience are always
welcome. For more information, in

Bergl at x3390 or vax [SPEECH],
“We really want more people to get
involved in this,” Heitz said. “We're
really excited about it and think it
will be a lot of fun!"
