Volleyball ends season
with close losses; betters
record under new coach

By Alex Severens

As teethachattering students on
campussnuggledtostaywarmamidst
the flurries ofsnow last weekend, the
volleyball team was at Monmouth
College ﬁghting an equally difficult
battleitl‘le fury of the MidwestCon-
ference Tournament. The enthusias-
tic Grinnell team found the going
tough and was unable to grab a vic—
tory during the two day tourney.

Beloit College posed the ﬁrst ob-
stacle between Grinnell and a Cone
ference Championship. Despite a de-
termined effort by thePioneers, Beloit
slugged out a 15-12 and 15-7 victory.

Grinnell also played a solid game
against Monmouth, but for the sec-
ond time inaweek,Monmouthbarely
tiptoed theirwaytoa 16-14 and 15-11
victory over the Pioneers.

The Grinnell women wrapped up
their conference Ioumey, as well as
their season against a stingy Lake
Forestteam. Grinnell foughthard but
watched the first set slip just inches
from reach, 17-15. The match closed
as Lake Forest used their first set
momentum to snatch a 15-3 victory.

Coach Sadewater expressed dis-
couragement about the tournament's
results, but noted that, “I saw things I

hadn’t seen much of this year. The
team played well, and they played
with an emotional intensity that pre-
viously had been lacking."

The team ﬁnished the season at
11-17, an improvement from last
year’s 9-17 record, Sadewater men-
tioned that many of this year'soppos-
ing coaches praised Grinnell's im-
provement from last year. The win-
loss record of a team is only one
indicator of a team’s success, and
Sadewater was proud to declare that.
“in terms of team cohesion, this was
an incredible season.”

The team sadly watches seniors
Courtney Wells, Susan Egbert. and
Amy Robinson leave the Pioneer
squad. Robinson led the teaminserv-
ing percentage with an impressive
957%1 Egbert led the learn in kills
wiﬂt 227 and in aces, with 35.

Younger players also contributed
a great deal to this season’s team.
First year Saraliene Smith led the
team in blocks with 95. Smithand the
restof the powerful group ofﬂrstyear
players on the team, along with the
two vetemnjttniors, Jocelyn Keough
and May Chan, will be the foundation
of Sadewarer‘s second season at
Grinnell next year.
