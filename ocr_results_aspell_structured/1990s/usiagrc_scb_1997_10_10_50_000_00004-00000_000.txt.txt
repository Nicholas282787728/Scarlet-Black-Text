‘ Dear Editor,

In an effort to appear “socially con»
cerned and conscious" the 38:3 has
printed numerous articles on
“multiculturalism."

The fact that "multiculturalism“ is
a topic in these articles does not re-
ﬂect a heightened awareness about
the issues surrounding diversity on
this campus. In fact. the S&B has
failed to take a CRITICAL look at
many of these issues. The resulting
mis-infonnation has only been a detv
rirnent to forwarding true social cone
corn and consciousness on this came
pus. Therefore, I'd like to give apere
spective which I feel more correctly
characterizes the actual nature of
“multiculturalism" on this campus.

First, I’d like to address the article
on “Minority Scholars In Residence"

(MSIR) that appeared two weeks ago
in the S&B. While Grinnell College
proudly lauds the MSIR program as
evidence to its “commitment to die
vcrsity," it is a Band-Aid placed hap-
hazardly over a gaping wound. This
college possess little to no diversity
in its many departments. Bringing

fan a professor for two weeks to a year
t-itloes little to generally address this
Eproblein. By the time these MSIR s
Scan acclimate themselves to Grinnell
is in order to make a POSITIVE change
:{within their respective departments,
titheir tenure at Grinnell expires. The
:college has created a revolving door
54in which Professors of color are
he, brought in, pimped as evidence of the
college’s “commitment to diversity"
hand then are conveniently discarded
ibet’ore these Professors can institute
:jany sort ofsubstantial change within
b‘the department or the college’s cur-
riculum. This is insulting Diver»
sity is an essential element of this
:Ecollege that is grossly lacking. A two
I creditshortcourse in “Asian Ameri»
can Literature" will not make up for
the exclusion of this literature' “1 all
‘of the other English courses Nei-
utther will the addition of temporary
‘ Ecourses involvtng Native Americans,

FAfrican Americans, and Latinosl
iiLatinas make any PERMANENT
g Echanges to the underrepresentation of

these groups in the curriculum. Di-
ziversity IS essential to Grinnell Col-
:rlege. The administration needs to
“quit treating it as a periphery issue
land begin to hire FULL- TIME fac-
lulty of color on tenure- track posi-
[ions in order to begin to create
iMEANINGFUL changes in faculty
:departmenls.

Next I would like to address this
. ,: week’ 5 article on SPACE First of

:5 all the title of the article was BLA-

' .TANTLY misleading. The Board of

' ‘ Trustees have made no sort of com-

_.- mitment to space for students of

s color They have formed a subcom-

mittee that has taken NO CON-

;_ E:CRETE ACTION on the part of

:- Trustees. Students of color asked for

:3 we things at the meeting: Recogni-

ion and Validation. First we asked

- . hat the college recognize our space

needs as essential to this institution.
, Secondly we asked for this recogni»
: tion to be validated in writing. We
i didn’t ask for any sort ofblueprints -
,Ijusl that the college sign a piece of
5 paper that would make them ac-
! countable for their rhetoric about
E being ‘committed" to space They
i refused to sign any sort of paper.
i Furthermore, the idea of signing

OPINION

twenty-five years after they made a
promise in writing to do so, that was
a muthaphuckin’ VIOLATION OF
TRUST. The Board of Trustees has
failed to take any CONCRETE AC-
TION. They refuse to be account-
able for what they say. Already they
have the admissions ofﬁce using this
"space" as a selling point for
prospectives of color. These empty
promises to prospective students will
be another violation of trust.
Students ofColor have worked dili-
gently for EIGHT years on the space
issue. We have traveled to different
colleges, done surveys, created peti-
tions, initiated a Student Initiative.
created flyers and informational
packets, and obediently jumped
through every hoop that the admin-
istration told us tojump through FOR
EIGHT YEARS. And after all of that
and all those years, how can you even
minimize the issue to the efforts ofa
single SGA president-who had mar-
ginal interest in the space issue?
Next. I’d like to respond to the

S&B‘ s tribute to Mt. Rushmore. I’ll
respond with a short history lesson
about the United States of
Amerikkka. First. when the Lakota
Sioux were violently driven off their
land, the US offered them territory
in the Black Hills, South Dakota.
The Lakota signed a treaty with the
US which was promptly (and ille-
gally) revoked when the United
States learned of gold on the Lakota
reservation That‘ s when they tried
to force the Sioux off with a group
of calvary led by General Custer
After Custer‘s force was annihilated,
the United States made it a priority
to murder and humiliate the Sioux.
Approximately ﬁfty years after the
Lakota Sioux were almost com-
pletely wiped out and relocated. the
United States built a monument on
their most sacred of mountains. It
would be the greatest violation of one
of the holiest of places for the Sioux
-it would be the carving of Mount
Rushmore.

Carving Mount Rushrttoi‘e on one:

of the holiest Sioux places would
serve as a testament to the power of
the union. George Washington is
honored as the father of the Union.
Thomas Jefferson as the man who
expanded the Union. (Both George
Washington and Jefferson are well
known for their enslavement, rape,
abuse, and murder of Africans.)
Abraham Lincoln is celebrated for
the preservation of the union. (He
can also be credited with authoriz-
ing the hanging of 38 Santee Indians
in Mankato, Minnesota for defend-
ing land that they legally owned...)
Theodore Roosevelt is credited for
America‘s “Manifest Destiny" (ex-
panding the Union). (Theodore
Roosevelt on Manifest Destiny: “Ex-
termination and land appropriation...
was as ultimately beneﬁcial as it was
inevitable. Such conquests are sure
to come when a masterful people.
still in it’s raw barbarian prime, ﬁnds
itself face to face with the weaker and
wholly alien race which holds a cov-
eted prize in it‘s feeble grasp") i am
not trying to single out the writer and
cartoonist. Instead‘I’d like to make
a point about Mount Rushmore and
Grinnell. Celebrating Mount
Rushmore is a symbol ofa winner’s
history that ignores the humanity and
existence of people of color.
Grinnell too has consistently lg-
nored and neglected the existence
and humanity of people of color.
White people have always come first
at Grinnell. ln regardsvto the space
issue, it is of vital importance to the
trustees that “other students" the,
white students) also want the estabv
lishment of cultural space. Students
of color are asked to “get permis—
sion” from white students to estab-
lish cultural centers. The opinion of
white students is VITAL to accom-
plishing anything on campus. But
no one ever asked people of color if
it was okay to build additions to the
Science and Fine Arts building. My
argument is not that these projects
were unnecessary, but I want to il-
lustrate where the opinions of people
of color lie in the administration‘s
eyes: on the periphery. and never of
importance unless we are protesting
or demonstrating. But even after

gaining the permission of white stun
dents for two years (last year’s stu-
dent initiative, the 500+name petition
of 1995). the Board of Trustees wants
yet another survey. Perhaps they are
worried that “diversity" is a fad for
white students. Once again, the
NEEDS of people of color are
subliminated to the desires of white
students. People of color are EXe
PECTED to accommodate to the
needs ofwhite students. The reverse
has never been the case. For people
of color, the door only swings one
way, and equal rcspect has never
been given to our voices. Ifthis was
the case. we wouldn’t be in an insti-
tution that spends more money on
recruiting football players that it does
African Americans.

Multiculturalism at Grinnell is a
joke.

It‘s a farce.

In order to find but, don‘t listen to
the administration’s rhetoric. and
don‘t look at the glossy brochures
that portray Grinnell as a “happy
rainbow."

Take a look around you.

(These opinions are my own, and in
no way should any other students of
color (or SOL, ASIA. or CBS for that
matter) be held accountable for them)

5&5 about a issue that is of great

state in your letter is true:
Multiculturalism at Grinnell is in-

We also do not appreciate yourrldn-

Dear Campus Community,

Coming out can be an act of pride,
and act of self-preservation, an act
oflove, a declaration of love. Com-
ing out can also be a political act, and
act of faith in the movement for
GLBT equal rights. or an act of faith
in what it could be, Coming out is
often involuntary, or simply a neces-
sity. No matter what the motivation.
coming out is always an act of great
courage.

We Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual.
Transgendered and Allied members
of the Grinnell Community applaud
those who have been honest in their
affectionai and sexual orientation in
the past, especially the GLBT
Grinnellians and their allies who
have helped make Grinnell the sup—
portive environment it is today,
While there is still a lot of work to
do, in Grinnell as well as in the

greater community. we acknowledge
National Coming Out Day as ourday
to celebrate the courage it takes to
be honest, accepting and proud. To-
day we also look around us toward
those friends, family and signiﬁcant
others who are still struggling to find
their courage to come out, and en-
courage them to take the next steps
in their coming out process. We also
thank those who helped us find out
place in being out and who continue
to work beside us in our battles
against ignorance and homophobia.

Every act of courage on our part is
empowering for those who will
come behind us, so we sign out
names as encouragement for those
who still cannot.

Signed,
