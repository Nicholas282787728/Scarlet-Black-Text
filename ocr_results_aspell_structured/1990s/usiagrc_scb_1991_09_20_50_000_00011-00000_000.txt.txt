Women's soccer successful
through "depth, team effort"

By Doug Hodum

_—_
On Wednesday the women’s soc-
cer team traveled to Cornell for a
divisionalmatch.Thatwas thebegin-
ning of a “week of solid team effort,”
according to Coach Eskildsen.

The team started slowly against
Cornell. The first goal was scored ten
minutesinto the gameby sweeperlen
Wood who henta comer kick into the
far side of the goal.

The team shook their slow start
and controlled the middle of the field
for most of the game. Steph Reisdorf
continued the scoring by heading a
comer kick. Anya Schwartz scored

on a rebound shot, and Amy Neevel
and Sarah Edmonds also added goals
from their center midﬁeld positions.

The team played well togetherand
shut out the Rams, 5-0.

Sunday, the team traveled to NLin-
nesota to take on a tough Augsburg
team. The game was played on a fast
and slick astroturf, which initially
created some problems for the Pio-
neers. They had a hard time settling
the ball until they adjusted to the
different surface by getting their bod-
ies in front of the ball.

Despite the adjustments, the teams
were still tied 00 at halftime.

With the wind to their backs in the

second half, the Pioneers finally broke
the lie when Steph Reisdorf scored
offa precise assist by Guen Gifford.

Fifteen minutes later, AmyNeevel
seemed the victory with a rebound
goal. Coach Eskildsen said that“depth
was the determining factor" in the
game. The players off the bench have
been performing well, Eskildsen
added.

Saturday. the team travels toKnox
in what may be the biggest game of
the season for the Grinnell women.
Eskildsen expects an emotional Knox
team which will“go hard to the ball"
