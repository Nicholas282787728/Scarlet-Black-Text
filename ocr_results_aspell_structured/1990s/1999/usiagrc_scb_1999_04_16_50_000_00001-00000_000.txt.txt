‘Rock Against the Bomb'

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Arts Edi tot

Tomorrow, Grinnell will host a dem-
onssrarion “Rock Against she Bomb.” Ber
ginning at 1 pm, the Grinnell commur
nity is invited to garher in South Lounge
to hear performers and speakers represent»
ing several different viewpoints.

Though the issue at the heart of this
demonstration is gravely serio us, the event
lrselfneed nor be equally morosc. organ
nizer Glenda Vickery Y00 said that she
envisions “an afternoon to demonstrate
some solidarity, share information, inspie
rarion, and hear some good music. We
have a common goal.”

This common goal is an end to the
bombing. Said Vickery, “This isn’t for any
particular side. . .I want to bring together
all the people who just want to bring an
end to military aggression or violence in
general."

Indeed, the conflict in Kosovo is multi-
sided and extremely complex. An open
forum hosted by the Rosenficld Program

was held on Tuesday to discuss the issue.
With North Lounge filled to capacity,
members ofrhe Political Science, Russian,
and French deparrmenrs, as well as Chap-
lain Dcanna Shorb and Rabbi Brin, related
their different perspectives In addition,
the audience was honored by the presence
ofjacek Michalowski, the Director Gene
cral in the Chancellory ofthc Prime Mine
ister of Poland. Several ofthe speakers at
she Tuesday meering have expressed inter»
est in speaking on Saturday

Event organizer Vickery, who planned
this protest with no funding, has lined up
a group of performers and speakers.
Among rhe performers are Bunsen Burner,
Xander, The Fates, Alyssa Nashold and
Gant Luxton, John Cummins and Sarah
Reimer, and an international band com-
prised of members from five different
countries. Speakers include Paul Ford 1()2,
Willis ’01, .Lambis
Konstantinidis '01, the Des Moines So-
cialists, and professors from Amos and Des
Moines. In addition, there will be an open
mic for anyone who wishes to speak.

Sherman

on Saturday

While reasons for participating in the
demonstrations vary from person to per-
sonl Vickery knows very well why she cter
ated the event. “There are people I love
on the ground in Yugoslavia being
bombed. I want them to know that these
bombs are not the sentiments of all Ameri-
cans.”

Though Vickery inirially envisioned a
very different demonstration, she Con—
sulted others, and eventually decided upon
“Rock Against she Bomb” because it was
“a culmination ofother people’s ideas and
us in line with orher proresss going on
around the world." Since that decision,
she and several others have worked non-
stop to organize the event.

In the future, Vickery said that she
would be willing to organize more ofthese
events, ifthere was interest. In the mean-
while, she is working on establishing a
website (htguj/wwwg-rimzell, Mil/individu-
aLr/mz‘lm) for sources ofinformation which
are alternative to the mainstream press.
