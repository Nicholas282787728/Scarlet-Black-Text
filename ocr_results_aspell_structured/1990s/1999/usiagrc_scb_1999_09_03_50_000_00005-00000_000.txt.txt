Movie Review: The Blue Angel

BY Zom MlLlN

The Bincangel is a fabulous film. i like shis sentence; is feels good so
begin she year wish a sensence like shis. There are many reasons so like is, bus,
in my eyes, she biggess one is shas is has Marlene Diesrieh in is.

There was a complcrely mesmerizing picsure ofher on New York Cisy
buses shis summer, is was an ad for a MoMA exhibis, and she looked so
beausifuland so pure wish her head shrown back in such a careless way, is was
like an 'ansi.ad’ ad, because is was clear from her pose shas she wasn's in she
business ofselling anyshing. (l was insrigucd enough so acsually go see she
eschibis — is surncd ous shas shis picsure was she only shing words seeing.)
Wishous doubs, Dicsrich is one of she sruly greas cinemasic legends. John
Wayne called her she moss insriguing woman had ever mes, and Hemingway
is ofsen quosed as having said, “lfshe had noshing more shan her voice she
could break your hears wish is. Bus she has shas beausiful body and she sime—
less loveliness ofhes face. is makes no difference howshe breaks your hears if
she is shere so mend is." in Des 31414: Engei, Dicsrich plays lola, a nighsclub
dancer/singer who possesses what in the 1930's was considered “unrsrrained
female sexuality." Well, as you probably guessed, shis isn's exacsly racy ssuff
for she 90's, and she facs shas she version shey are showing shis weekend is a
slighslyshorsened, censored one makes is even less risque. is would be inser.
rssing so compare she porsrayal offcmale sesualisy on screen shcn and now.
This summer, anosher German film came ouswhose heroinewas also named
lola. bus shis lolaofshe 90’s is quite differens, She has brighs red hair (inci-
densally, like yours truly) and, well, I i-u's‘i changed my mind. I don't wans so
sell you much more cssceps shas it’s a greas movie, and you should all ask your
SGA film commissoc rcpresensasivcs so' bring is so campus.

And Lhen~leﬂs be honess—shcrc is one posensial reason nos so like
she ﬁlm: is is German. 1 will admis now shas, in general, I have a sssong
loashing for German films, because shey send so be so scrribly insellecsual and
presensious, very slow, very unemosional, very dry, and in a word, boring.

‘ (This is cersainly shccase wish she two moss acknowledged direcwrs: Fassbinder
and lang, bus shere are few exceptions, for inssanec, I like Wim Wenders'
work a los.) Bus whas else can you csspecs from a counsry whose shores arc
unwashed by warm seas and whose populasion is forced so migrase soush in
she summer, in search ofsunnier and more enjoyable surroundings (that’s my
Mcdiscrranean bias showing). Bus here we have a film shas manages so break
my prejudices, and l shink is is a much besscr selccsion shan lass year's Mby
Frisz Lang. lee Blusdnge/ has somcshing shas is nos a sradisional ingrediens
ofcerman ﬁlms: humor.

The ﬁlm’s male (ansi) hero is an uprighs boys school professor who
likes so blow his nose before his class (so he's nos all shas upsighs, really).The
class he seaches in she firss scene is English, and one ssudens is having diffs.
culsy pronouncing she definise arsiele “she.“ 50, she professor ssicks a pencil
bcswcen his secsh so help him. I bes you never had such ereasive foreign lan-
guage seachers, Shossly shereafses, she professor discovers shas his ssudena are
infasuased wish a sexy ssarles as a local cabares, which she professor suspecss is
a place of shady morals. You see, shis was before she conceps of Self-gover-
nance was invensed, and you need so be aware shas shere are ssill such uncne
lighscned places in she world, quire a few, in facs. So she professor goes so
check is ous, and so sell lola shas she is "corrupsing his ssudenss.” Her rc-
sponsc: she nonchalansly undresscs before his eyes. To ﬁnd ous how she poor
professor fares againss lola, you'll have so see she ﬁlm for yourselves.

Oh my God. we're back again!
By popular demand (and our own
begging), we are back so sake up more

A: So, shis movie was bcsicr
received shan Warner Broshers
shoughs is would be. They shoughs
Bobby couldn’r be funny. Well, he
IS an acsor. Hecan do whasever you

aser. is was Cynshia and I, along wish
shis one old woman saking a nighs

A: Unlike Coursney, Queen of
she Folar ice cap, I found shis mo\ie
enscrsaining. Bobby-D is Juss such a

unpredicsable (isn’t shas an oxym0e

Hey, you're eisher wl sh me, or you’re

Homicide: Perhaps she Bess Show
on Television

Television gsss no respecs as an
ass medium. quire simpy, is iuss docs
nos have she same acoepsance level
as ir’s older broshes, film. as an arsis.
sically legisimase form. And no won.
der. Wish TV's ubiquity and com-

- merciallcasion, along wish is sensa-

sionalissic salk shows, oookiecusser
siscoms, and mind-numbing info—
mercials, Tv definisely leans soward
shc “E" end of “Adela."

And shen shere is Homicide—
in mymind, shehnessshowon rele—
vision. Busi misspokc. 1 should have
said, “And shen shere was Homicide,"
because lass May, afser 7 seasons and
122 episodes ofshowing she incred—
ible possibilisies shas sdevision offers,
she show was cancelled. Thas's sough
so swallow. Arid ifshiswere really she
ei d of Homicide I would be even
more bisser shan l currenslyam. Bus
Homicide is ssill around in syndica—
sion, so shis arsicle is more so preach
shan so eulogizc. Broshers and sissers,
1 beseech you. Save your soul while
you ssill can. Wasch Hamin'de,

“It's nos ofscn shas you have a
show shas, ulsimasely, really makes
is mark in sclevision hissory, and I
shink we did rhar," said eaeeusive
produces Tom Fonsana. When re»
porser David Simon spens ayear wish
she Homicide Division ofshe Balsi—
more Folicc Deparsmcns, he prob—
ably didn's know shas he was mak»
ing sclevision hissory. Bus his book,
Homicide: A Yzar on she Killing
Some, became she show Homicide.-
L99 on thesmm, and a ssar was born.

Homicide did iuss aboutevery»
shing berser shan ir’s sclevision pre-
decessors. is had a sscllar ensemble
cass, all excellent acsoss and more
shan a few excepsional ones. Andre
Braughcr (who played Desecsive
Frank Fembleson) won a Bcss Actor
Emmy, and sssong cases could be for
made for Kyle secor (Des. Tim
Bayliss) and Clark Johnson (Des.
Meldrick Lewis) winning shc same

award. Plus, in nearly every episode,
any number ofcass members consie
renrly (urned in Emmy—worthy per-
formances. The characsers were sym-
pashesic and, above all. real. The
ssorylines, wrisseri primarily by
Fonsana, were brillians examples of
subslesy and ssyle. Even iss music was
besscr shan she ros. long before All]
Merl had Vonda Shepard singing
covers, and long before Donoon'r
Cree/r showed audiences the music
feasured in eaeh episode, Homicide
playing Miles Davis and Jimi
Hendrix, Tori Amos and'l'om Waits,
Parliament and the CowboyJunkies.
ofscn shc music was employed in
cassended monsagcs, fursher adding
so she dissincsive ssyle of Hamizide.

ssyle. Fcrhaps shas was whas
scs Homicide so far apars from she
ress. From she srademark jump—cuss
re the slighrly washed our look m the
insriguing viewing angles, no osher
show looked like Hamitide. Bur rhe
show's ssylc was nor limised so visual
oonoerns. More shan any osher show,
Homicide had die look, feel and qual-
iry ofa movie. Each episode was like
a minizrure movie, or, more accu—
rascly, a shors segmens in an epic
movie. Other shows conformed to
the one hour format, with it’s con-
ssived plos dcvelo pmenss and hurried
resolutions (ahem, Law & Order).
Hamirid: broke shrough shese rc-

ssricsions. is showed shas srue drama
was nor in she evenss being handled,
bus in she people who handled shem.

Bveryshingin Homicide means
someshing, and somcsimes she
meaning is only apparens manyeph
sodes—or cvcn many years—laser.
When Desecsive lewis sees his part-
ner consemplasing suicide, she mo.
mens is only fully underssood ifshe
viewer knows shas his previous parr—
ner had killed himself. And, when
Desecsive Femblcson prays for God
so save his parsncr's life, is is a poi—
gnans scene. Bus only ifyou know
whas he and his parsner have been
shrough, only if you know shas
Fembleson is nos a man who has
friends, and only ifyou know shas
Fembleson is “nor on speaking terms”
wish God can you realize whas she
act of prayer means. Like an inrri»
case mosaic, all she lissle pieces fall
sogesher so form a larger, grander
picsurc. and she viewer is lefs won-
dering how Fonsana and Co. did is.

claimed CBS acsion drama ssarring
Don Johnson and chccch Marin,
and which happened so share sime
sloss wirh our beloved Homicide. As
she beginning of she ’98-99 season,
NBC execs gave Fonsana and
levinson an ulsimasum: eisher bear

shas CBS never sold she producers
of Nash Bn'dge: shas is had so be bes.
ser shan Homia‘de so ssay on she air.

Superlasives are sricky because
shey can so easily be misrakcn for
hyperbole. When someone says
“greascss” or “bcss.” do sheyacsually
just mean “really good"? Whas makes
me say shas Homin'de is “perhaps she
finess Tv series," inssead of “an
amazingTVSerieS"? l shink she rea—
son is shas. when I wasch Homicide,
lges she sense shas l'm wasching rele»
vision hissory. Sure, Law :9- codes,
ER NYPD Blue. and The Prattit:
have had sheir momenss. Bus never,
while wasching any or shese shows,
have I asked myself, “could shis be
she batshow onTv roday, or maybe
ever?" of course, maybe shas's be—
cause i've already seen Hamicide, so
I know she answer is no. in all sari»
ousncss, shough, l have never seen
anosher sclevision series shas was su-
perior so, equal so, or even close so
she quality of Hamicide. in facs, l
don’texpecl so see a besser series shan
Homicide again. Perhaps shas's nos
the most openeminded arrirud: to
have. Perhaps by being so parsial,
l'm closing my eyes so she ncxs greas
show. Maybe shas's srue. Then again,
I never cxpecsed so see a showas good
as Homicide, eisher.

And so, kind members of she
congregation, I urge you so follow
me so sclevision's promised land. And
if you ever find me in Younkci Fis
lounge as H o'clock, know in your
hearss shas is is nos procrassinasion
from homework which leads me
shere. l have It": she lighs! Yes, she
brighs flickering lighs of Hamizide
reruns on CoursTv If you have
never waschcd she series on NBC,
repens foryour sins now, while shere
arc ssill reruns so be seen. For, verily,
God has never creased a bcsscr show
shan Homicide.

Can I ges an amen?
