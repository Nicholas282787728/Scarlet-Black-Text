Grinnell: ROTC ground

BY BRENDAN FLAHERTY

Several weeks ago a group or Grinncll
students and i discussed wirh a professor
how Grinnell had changed over the years.
he one point, rhe professor, a vereran of
Grinnell campus lire, so ro speak, proe
claimed thar what rhe crinncll College
community needs is a resurrecrion of rhe
campus army ReserveOfTieer'l'raining Core
(ROTC) Chaplet The response from his
student audience was immediare and un»
cquivocal: laughrer all around. The idea of
uniformed ~crinnell srudenrs drilling
xhrough the South campus loggia seemed

ar bcsr a comic anaehronism and ar worst a
conscious mockery ofcrinnells hisrory of
social activism and uncanvenrional
thought. '

Although ir may nor be pracrical to re.
open a ROTC chapror ar crinirell, why ex»
aerly is rhe thought ofROTC at Grinnell
so inherently funny? ROTC, sprogram that
offers some of rho mosr subsranrial schol.
arships available, is nor likely ro be very
comic to a Grinnell srudenr struggling to
pay for Crinncll’s gold.plared education.
Accepting a ROTC scholarship involves
committing to a stint in rhe National
Guard, Army Reserves or rhe Army proper;
however, is rhere any reason why a
Grinnellidn who places rhe urmosr value
on edoearion should not have the oppor-
runiry to rake advanrage of rhe ROTC:
oer? is ir so absurd to picture ROTC ar
Grinncll College when ROTC, however
quietly, eurrenrly maintains chapters ar
schools as diverse as Gustavus Adolphus,
Drake University and, through rho Univer.
sity ofMinnesora, Macalasrer College? As
Grinnell studenisembrace educational op-
porruniries outside rhe normal limits ofa
libeial arts education in the form ofExco.
why is exposing sludcnts to the hands on
managerial and leadership skills raughr
through ROTC so outrageous? 1ch bar
licve rhar Grinncll is a place where ideas
are challenged, where a wider worldview is
adopted and where values are formed and

transformed, rhcn would ii nor be wise for
us ro invire potential inilirary officers to or.
rend rather ihan seofnngly discourage
them?

Many people disagree with rho prin»
ciplesinhercnrinanymilirary nrganiaarion,
bur clearly we have an obligation ro malnr
rain campus organiiarions which embody
unpopular principles, wherher rhey be pro-
Arnerica oi anti—America, Capitalist or
Communisr, Christian or atheisr There is
also the chance, ofeourse, ihar by opening
a ROTC chapter and accepring students
who wish ro ioin, Grinnell will lose the ass
senrial eharaorer which appealed to most
of crinnell's srudenrs in the first place,
Grinnell could begin inching irs way right.
ward on the polirical speorrum.

This concern, I believe, wasar rhe heart
orour laughter. we laughed ar the rhoughr
ofROTC at Grinnell because rhe image of
ROTcimarcl-iing unirormed “cadets"
wirh “America: love ir or leave it” etched
on their norebook coversiseemcd torally
incongruous with our images of politically
and socially liberal, ifnor radical, Grinnell

- Sludcl‘llsa Th: substance of what ROTC

does and can do was a in less importanr
consideration. if image was so important
in our outright dismissal of ROTC, rhen
rhe quesrion musr be asked ofour erisring
campus organizanons: do rhcy exist at
Grinnell because they make us look and feel
good or because ofrheir substantive action?

Monday, February 15, at a pm. in ARH 502, forest acrivisr, Dave Damsrrom, will be presenting a miilrirnedia program abour a growing
inrernarional movement to halt the destruction ofrhe largesr inracr temperate rainforesr on Earth located on rhe remote mainland coast of
British Columbia, Canada. ”wirh so lirrle ofrhe/temperate rainforesr remaining unlogged worldwide, this thriving complex of diverse
temperate rainforesr ecosystems represenu one ofrhe rarest biological treasures on rhe planer," says Damsrrom.

Dear scarlet est blackand fellow pa-
rrons of rhe Orinncll College dining
halls,

i am writing [0 express my intense
sarisfacrion with a new glimmer of
beauty that has been introduced into
oneoroursehool's Cafeteria’s this bright,
new semester. A bir ornauscaring filth
rhat occupies oiir dining halls and are
away ar our minds, leaving us nearly
powerless to truly enioyour nutritional
cuisine, has disappeared. 1 refer, of
course, to the pseudoenewspaper USA
Today.

once again our srudenrs can breath
rhc meal-lime air free of pollution by
colorrul lies and blind aporheoses of
Consumprion. No longer does the las-
civious visage of rhis infectious Age of
Consumption leer at us each morning,
midday and evening unril we reach rhe
poinr ofchoiee between revolr and de.

spair, The Orear Modern Marker Sys--
rem has been dealt a blow, slight though
it maybe, by the ﬁne frequenrers of
Cowles Dining Halls, Their bold and
inrransigenr refusal to purchase this in.
srrurncnr ofpopulardesrruericn has led
gloriously ru rhe commodlry's removal
from rhc register rablc. I rake rhis op-
porruniry now to errend thanks to :v»
ery companion in rhe struggle, who ran
fused, cirher due to idealism, ignorance
or parsimony, to aid in rhe propagarion
ofrhis plague on humanity; and l urge
the beleaguered patrons onuad and the
Forum to follow the :xamplc set by rheir
brave northern brothers. The time is
now to :xtirpat: rhis horror from our
lives, and let us ensure that norhing like
it ever returns.

Truly sincere,
Joseph crim Feinberg

This area, called the Great Bear Rainforcsr, also lies wirhin rhe uneeded rerrirories ofnarive people, called First Narions, who have never
surrendered, sold, or rrearied rheir rradirional lands. oamsrrom says their traditional cultures and livelihoods are dependent on the abun-
dant planes and animals, such as cedar and salmon, which are provided by rhe inracr temperate rainforesr, "I've learned from ehe people of
rhe Nuxalk Nation rhar traditional sovereignty means responsibility to the land‘, not 'power over others," says Damsrrom "1r is rhis erhos
of traditional eulriires rhar enables those people to care for and prorecr rhe land, and ir is essential that rheir way be recognised and
honored."

Since 1995 Damsrrom has been working wirh rhe First Nations people and environmental groups in rhe crear bear Rainforcsr, and
touring through the us to inform the public and generare support ror this urgent campaign

often living in remote rainforesr camps, parriciparing in logging blockades, and paddling in his kayak ro explore rhis lasr big remperare
rainforesr srronghold, Damsrmm has seen and felr borh rhe stunning beauty orrhe living roresr and the horror ofrhe raw dcserucrion by
massive clearcur logging

indusrrial clear»cui logging is reienrlesslyinvadmg this grand biological paradise valley, says Damsrrom. The government ofilrirish
Columbia ignores rhe natural rights ofbiodiversiry and rhe sovereign rights ofFrisi Nations, and freely grants permirs to logging companies
srriking hard for profits on uneeded lands!“ bams‘rrom believes that rhe rejection ofrhe rights and land erhie cfPirst Nations is fundamen-
ral to a government-industry agenda to liquidate virtually all remaining produerive old growth temperate rainforesr in rhe near furure,
destroying it forever.

Responding to this crisis, Damsrrom says many environmenral groups, such as rhe Raincoasr Conservation Society, Rainforesr Action
thwork and Greenpeace, have formed a coalition called rhe Canadian Rainforesr Network, and are working wirh some Firs't Narions
peoples to protect the rainforesr from future desrurcrion. on the from lines, he says, are rhe Nuxalk Nation Sovereignisrs and the Forcsr
Action Network. Togerher (hes: allies are waging a no compromise campaign of non violent direct aerion By occupying rhrearened
warersheds, and biockading logging operations, rhis powerful alliance is striking rhe most fundamental challenge ro a system that has
destroyed land and people at will! says Damsrrom

With images and stories, Damstrom is again telling rhe continuingsrory about a growing international movement ofpeoplewho, with
their love, courage, wisdom, and spirited dedicarion to non violent direor action, are rising up to defend a majestic remperare rainforesr
homelandl
