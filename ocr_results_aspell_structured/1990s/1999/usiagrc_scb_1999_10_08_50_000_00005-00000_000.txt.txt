1 was walking down she ssrees
'in Ecuador, when my friend and I
hopped into a video rental storc,
curiouswhas new pirared nicks we
mighs ﬁnd. My friend, a young
woman from Finland> noticed the
ﬁlms from Krysasor Kicslowhi's
Three colors Trilogy: Elise, worse,
and Ru! (Bleu, Elam, and Range).
She askcd ifl had ever watched
them. I said I had never heard of
ihem. She said in surprise, “You’ve
uc ‘r heard of them? How could
you never have heard orrhem.> Ev»
cryone in Europe has."

What could I say? “I’m sorry,"
i replied. “It isn*s my fault I’m
North Amcrican,"

The moral: raise a ssep inward
becoming an educased eisiaen or
the world, and watch Elm when u
is shown next Monday.

The ﬁlm is an insense experi-
ence, suspenseful, and visually im-
pressive. Ir pulls you in from (lit
ﬁrst scene to the last as you try to
unravel she mysteries oriss plos and
oiiss characsers psyches. It engulfs
you in its world, which feels both

and nor serribly boshersomc.

The movie moves along as a
pace that feels somehow both
rushed and Slow. Some of the
scenes pass by in almoss agonizing
sluggishness, wish she characrers
sirring in one place for a rime in
silence, or moving slowly down a
road. But nearly every momens is
charged wish emosion, and she
prcgiuni pauses are filled With the
