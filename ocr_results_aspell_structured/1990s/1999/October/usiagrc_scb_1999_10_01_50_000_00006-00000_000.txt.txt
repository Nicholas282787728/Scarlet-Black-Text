When you warch “TieMe Up,
Tie Me Down,” try to pur aside
for a few momenrs your norions
orlove and moraliry. Then you'll
have a berrer rime purring up
with this farcical, sensual
comedy by Spams renowned
direcror Pedro Almodovar. In
a series ofabsurdly believable
scenes revolving around a psy.
chiatric parienr who kidnaps
a woman in order to make her
love him. rhe ﬁll-n explores rhe ale
mosr parhological dependence of
humans upon one anorher and
rhe equation of love wirh suiier-
ing.
When Ricky, played by An-
ronio Banderas, is released hom
rhe psychiarric hospiral where he
has spenr mosr orhis life, he sees
our immediarely ro win rhe hearr
ora woman he mer a year earlier
when he escaped from the hospi-
ral. The woman is Marina, a
former pom ﬂares and junkie
who is arraid to call rhe police
when Ricky kidnaps her. Besides
rhem, a small array orcharacrers,
all plagued by rheir own problems
andobsessions, ﬁll our rhe movie.
The main characters lead misc
erable lives and do terrible things
onscreen. We feel rhar we should
hare them; bur they are porrrayed

 

as likable people, and we end up
sympathizing deeply with rhe vioe
lenr criminal and rhe drug addicr.
The srory does nor simply rry ro
convince us ihar eve-n lowlires have
a sensitive side. irs main idea is
more complex rhan than It shows
how, on rhe orherhand, even good
people can do horrible rhings,

The movie treads a ﬁne line
between condoning rape and as—
sault and sensitively exploring
a facet of the human condition.

Further, ir shows rhe pleasure

and even from making orhers suf-

sure; rather, the characters seem to
acr innocenrly, as if rhey know or
