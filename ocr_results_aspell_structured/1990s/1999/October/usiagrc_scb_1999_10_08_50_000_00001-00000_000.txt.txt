After six weeks, Expresses open

Changes for this year include convenience store atmosphere, prices not points

By Erik Gable
Staff Writer

Over 300 students rutncd our Monday for the
lungtnwaircd opening of Northern and southern
Express, The dining services satellite stores. which
hogan two ycats ago with a single stotc outside
Cuwlcs dining hall, have been expanded and com.
pletely reworked, With some oFrhc morc ambir
tiorrschangts resulted in the Espresses openlngscv-
oral t cits late, rnanystudcnts feel it waswcll worth
rhctvair,

Last year, the Expresses operated exclusively as
an allerlmrlvc for students who mrssctl one ol'therr
meals earlier ttr rhc day. Customers vvtro given 17
"points“ to spend on various items, and orders were
ﬁlled by Express staff.

The now Expresses operate on what Director or
Dining Scrviccs Dick Williams calls a “convcnicncc
state” system They now carry a small stoclt orol:
flu and health supplies in addition to food, and
smdcms can choose from a number or payment
options.

Meal equivalency no longer runs on the point
system Instead, customers who skipped a dining
hall meal are credited $3.50, which they can spcnd
on any food rtcm in the store. students can also
use hontts points from the
Forum or thc Treasurer‘s
ofﬁce, or- pay cash

Williams noted that
whcn rcdccminga skipped
meal from their board
plan, customers can only
purchase food. This is
srmrlarrntthorumGtrll‘s
policy, whereby Forum points cannot lac uscd to
purchase items such as laundry chips.

said.

According to Williams, as late as last Friday at
tetnoon Dining Scrviccs wasn’t sure everything
would be set up in time. The system worked, how»
ever, and the stores were able to open on schedule.

“i asked a couple orsrudcnts [Monday] ntght if
it was worth rhc wait," Williams said. “They said,
Yes, deﬁnitely?”

”We appreciate the customers' patience,“ he
added, isoth with the delays and wtrh learning the
