IudyGarland standsoutamongGrins
ncll students for more than her famous
name. She is also a “non-traditional” stu-
dent: she has enrolled fullstime at Grin»
nell rhis year arrcr having married, raised
two children, and lived in the: “real world”
longer dran most orher srudears have been
alive. She even has two grandchildren.

While living in Southern California
with her husband, a class of ’67 Grinnell
graduare, Gare
land gor herAA
in art history at
orange Coasr
College and
san Diego
Sraro. Though
she feels Cali-
fornia had a
“ w o n d e r Ful

“so hectic and

years, they de»
clded to move
back to (hf:

Midwest. “It
wasn’t until we

from all that
business that I
made time to
cornplere» my [bachelor's] degree.“

Garland has a great deal orrespcer tor
a Grinnell College education. She had
been impressed by her husband's college
friends and what rhcy were doing in rlre
world. Then, as a Noun Program Assis-
tant at Gtinnell for 4 years. she witnessed
rho “depth and breadrh orrvlrar happens
here," She rook a tow classes per scmesrcr
before resigning her job to he a full—rims
srudcnr, as several semesters orresidoncy
are required ror gmduarion.

This semester Garland is taking an Art

Hrsrory or the American West. Humanir

course in Shadows with rhe professors

learning to play the bovvdhran, a wood-
framc drum used in Celtic music. it’s been
a rough semesrer ror her time manage.
menvwis: with the full course load and
learning a new instrument.

Both Garland and her fellow younger
srudenrs can gain somerhing from an
inrergencrationai classroom dynamic. She
says she has “more ora world view” rlran
before, when she was “so caughr up on
|hc mommy track."

“its anrazing what ir does ro your
rhinkrng to be exposed to rhe new and
energeric ideas rhar come up in class dis-

rl

cussion," she explains. "Hopciirlly that’s
a [Warway street." For her part, Garland
can share with classmates her experience
or being our in the world, having lived
some ofhistory growing up in rhc '60s.
she also has a greater appreciation than
most students orrhc luxury ofbeing able
to devote oneself full-time to studying,
even if it can be difficult.

Garland, widi rol‘cs bath in the Grin-
nell community and at [ht college, is in
a special posirion ofbeing able to critique

the percc p.
tions these two
spheres have of
each ether. She
and her hus-
band chaired
the ’99 Town-
Gown Cam-
paign. a joint
effort to raise
funds to un-
derwrite the J.
B. Grinncll
scholarships '
for G ri an all
high school
students. She’s
also been ac-
tive a: the
c o m m u in ry
Arr Gallery
and in St.
Paul’s Church,
and is on the art advisory board for the
Grinncll Regional Medical Center.

On: myth mat Garland feelsstudenrs
often have about the town is that there is
no cultural life separate from the college.
Students are not aware of the Commu-
nity Theatre Group or art collection at
die hospital. sh: said. Garland also knows
there are many people in town who have
never been to one ofthe free concerts or
performances oncarnpus. While hesirara
ing to speak {or other pcoplt’s feelings,
she thinks that when townspeople are on
mmpus they feel that they are “other" and
may be intimidated by the Icputation of
the college. “I don’t know how to get past
that? she ponders. “I’m very comfort-
able here."

For her years Garland is a rypical
senior in rhar she is unsure other post-
graduntion plans. She's drinking of port»
sibilirics for grad school, probably at
University oftowa. she's also been ap-
proached abour business opportunities.
Though she‘s been throughout the us,
she hasn’t been overseas, so she’d like to
travel after graduation. In any case, Cara
land Sees her Grinnell education as an
enriching expericncc. “l—lopciully what
I’ve started at Grinncll will turn into a
lii’olong process orient-hing and sharing
what I’ve learned."
