Hoop Dreams for women

G s contend that athletics are em»
powering for girls, sports participation
helps girls to build confidence and gain
assertiveness, fundamental qualities shas
women should possess. While she role of
athletics in acqiiisingshesc qualities is con-
scsrablc, is also holds a grain of rsush. In-
dividuals, women in parricular, beneﬁt
from sports. Athletic parsicspasion is more
than skinned knees and body odor; is fos.
sers teamwork, a ssrong work sshic, and
sclfcestecm. I'd say these assets are pretty
imporsans, especially considering she nega»
rivisy directed towasd women in our cul-
sure in general.

Okay. so I’ve established shas women's
participation in sports such as basketball
have a positive impact on sheis lives. What
does shas have so do with attendance as
events? I guess I’m simply surprised that
as a college where females are the maioriry
of she population, where womanhood is
.celebrated in numesous ways and where
the Gender and Women's studies concen.
srasors continue so grow in number
(swensyfive concentrators will graduate
shis spsingl there isnls more open support
for Women’s athletics. colleen Bittner, a
writer for the omlinc journal 5%

primarily a male activity" (http://

Bittner’s stance. Title IX created a world
ofdifference between our generation and
that ofour parents. Unfortunately, some
vestiges ofshe old days still remain.

Perhaps my iudgmenr is a bit harsh.
Yet, the seeming lack ofsuppors for
women's sports programs, women’s basket.

All faculty members so whom I spoke,
however, wans nothing so do wish any

Brown and caulkins demonssrase, many
professors are disappointed by the unin»

students sometimes express in their Class»

The general faculty consensus is shas

Grinncll (ic. selective private liberal arts
colleges) are selfeselected groups, which

they’d like so make ssudenss mose

college faculty is less socialist than is was
ﬁfteen or twenty years ago. He also be-
lieves that die influx ofinternational stu-
dents, many of whom know that non»
capitalist systems can also be quite op-
prcssivc, is changing student attitudes as
well,

Steve Langetud, Grinnell’s Director
ofCareer Development, emphasizes that
Grinnell now offers many more oppor-
sunisies for internships than in she pass.
He says, “For current students having a
positive experience [in an internship] ofe
ten ltgitimizcs the for-proﬁt enterprise.”

‘ ,He also credits President Osgood. mar

Iigncd as he is, for focusing on students’
pscparasion for leaving Grinnell. He
notes, however, that all the added oppor-
tunities are useless without students in-
terested in exploiting them.

Here’s where I feel the need to lnlct-
venes Friends, Romans, Grinnellians:
GIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR A
CHANCE. Tsuss me. I just accepted a
job wish one ofshose big, evil manage
merit consulting ﬁrms and there was no
blood letting involved. As far as I can tell,
my soul still belongs to me. Yet when stu-
denss congrasulase me, I often gcs cloaked
disapproval in statements like, “Well, at
least you won‘t have to worry about
money anymore.”

I know you want to save sheworld,
but bless your little vegan hearts, thc non-
proﬁts can’t do it by themselves, They
need some good people dirtying their
hands in the corporate realm, I want to
improve shc world just as much as she
next person. III didn’t take thciob I was
offered, then is would go so some idiot
from Harvard with idiot Harvard values,
and I don’t think anyone wants that.
Langerud supports this rationale, “Many
alums find they have the most impact on
their community by working in she for»_
proﬁt sector."

If Grinncll wants to be a successful
institution, it needs to teach students how
so sransfosm their usopian urges into so»
phisrioated visions for improving our so—
ciety (or someone else’s). For their part
students need to be careful in determin»
ing for what and against what they are
ﬁghting, There is room for improvement
on both sides.

Con The Democrats
Weather The S’iorm?

By ANDREW CIVETTINI '

There is a storm waiting so brew in
Washington. Itwlll bsgin gaining momen-
tum soon and will become ﬁcrccrwith time,
climaxlng in November of the year 2000.
No, is has nothing so do wish Monica
Lewinsky, not anything so do with Marion
Berry, bosh orwhom we all know and love.
No, this ssorm will censor its eye on she
2000 general election, an election likely so
talk about family—values,.political account-
ability, and moral va
she Republicans claim so have the upper
hand, and in the aftermath of impeach-
mcns, it is unclear who will come out
scarred and who will come out unscathed.
Nevertheless, slic 2000 election promises
so be a good show.

Thcre is little question that Vice Presi-
dent AI Core will carry through shc pri-
mary process and gain the Democratic
Party nomination. But which person will
come through for she Republicans? There
has been plenty of
talk of the good
prospects of an

campaign, how—

ever she lacks the
necessarycohcsion
ofkcpublican ide-
als shas will carry
the next nominee
through. This co.
hesion will likely
come in the form
ofa candidate who
both takes stands
on moral issues
and has the mainstream capability to get
elected, That candidate is Senator john
Ashcroft ofMissouri. chcr heard ofhim?
Don‘s worry, you will.
john Ashcroft has been labeled by some
the "Reagan ofthe 90's." What this means
is shas he possesses she necessary chasm and
natural leadership ability to propel him into
national prominence. Ashcroft has gained
the unofficial approval of the Chrissian
Coalition'and I’éf‘Riibertson. His‘candi»
dacy strengthens when you consider him
againss she osher moral Conservatives, such
as Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer, and Dan
Quayle. All of shcse candidases lack one
thing: the ability to get elected. steve
Forbes will again run in the primary as she
champion ofeconomic conservatives, but
will be unable to attain the support neces-
sary so win she nomination. Geosge Bush,
Jt., and Elizabeth Dole round out the GOP
list in she moderate pragmasisss group.
However. Ashcroft has a distinct advan-
tage. The moral sighs is rushless about carn-
paigning for a man they believe in. They
are more particular about drumming out
the support in she primaries so help
Ashcroft gain the nomination. This will

 

be his key so she general election, an elec-
sion where he stands a chance againss Gore,
who is ofsen crisicized for being too lib.
oral.

I managed so watch a sape of John
Ashcroft speaking on the ﬂoor of she scn-
ase last year. He has a smoosh ssylc that
leaves you wanting more. His down-so-
eassh sincerity makes him an asssacsivc
speaker. One ofhis biggest assets is that he
speaks about what he is forthright whas hc is
againss. Thus in order to show his disap-
proval oraborsion, he would hold up a
sonogram and sell the audience how beau-

ssacsive, accessible area for ssudenss so
gasher in pleasant weather on North cam-
pus (to function like she Quadrangle for
South). I encourage a campus dialogue on
this psoposal and hereby swear that a can—
didate shas will push for this idea’s adop-
tion will reeeieve as lcasr one additional
vote» mine.

lies, in case you missed that, Ashcroft is a
religious man. He is a member ofshe As»
somblies of God, a religion that prohibits
smoking and drinking To top it all off, his
programs appeal to moral conservatives,
economic conservatives, moderates, and
sometimes even Democrats. so is Ashcroft
a diamond in the rough?

No. His overs religious and moralistic
soncincveryshinghe says and docswill huts
him in she general election. Furthermore,
his simple nature may work against him,
and be dramatized by a Democrasic candi-
dasc who presents complex polieyideasand
implementation techniques. Where this
election will be won or lost will be in the
heated campaigns of the late August and
September and in she selection ofVice Presi-
dential candidates. Although I am not a
huge fan of she Republican Party oisheir

ideals, I am interested
in a Close race. Th:
Republicans have a_
chance to make it
closes.
one wise decision
politically would be to
nominate Elizabeth
Dole as VP and bring
horsphereofinfiucnce
on board. Cessainly
shis would help move
the position of the
ticket more central,
and that alone would
Iv lp the Republicans.
But I bel' . .ncr possibility exists, At
only 42 years ofage and in his fifth year in
the House, J.C. Watts is a rising ssar in the
Republican Party. He now is she Chairs
man ofshe House Republican Congress, she
fourth highest position in the House. This
also makes him the highest ranking Afrl»
caneAmerican in Congress. An cx—star col-
lege football player for Oklahoma, Warts
now is an ordained Southern Baptist min-
ister. He was ﬁrst elected to the House in
1994 from a district that was 88 percent
white and 67 percent Democratic. And if
you drink he may be a token minority for
the Republicans, think again. Watts told
the all-Democratic Congressional Black
caucus that his {ashes had raised him “so
be a man, not a black man.” Clearly Watts
sees his ability and hard work as the seasons
for his position, and he may be just whas
she Republican nomination calculus needs
to garner rho independent votes and win in
2000.

ultimately, she biggest necessity for the
Democrats in the 2000 election will be find.
ing a VP candidate that centralizcs their
ticket. Another major concern in survive
ing the challenge ofshe Missouri senator is
to make sure that Dick Gophars (who co»
incidentally is a Missouri politician himself)
does not scar apart Gore in shc primaries,
leaving an-empry shell for she Republicans
to finish the job ori. The unification ofshe
surcalled umbrella party will be necessary
to stave othhe worthy challenge ofshe year
2000 Republicans. Nonetheless, is is a chal»
lengc I believe she Democrats are willing to
meet,
