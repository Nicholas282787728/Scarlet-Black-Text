Creating a health model

“The goal ofthe project is to create

Agreement closer on
Iowa’s war against meth‘

It now appears likely that the Iowa Legislature Will establish a tough and
comprehensive package oftools to ﬁght the state’s war against methamphet-
amine. Gov. Tom Vilsack and legislative leaders have reached accord on
ways to deal with the distribution and use ofthe potentially deadly drug,

One local lawmaker, state Rep: Danny Carroll. Ran'lincll. said hc
supports the idea because iowa needs “a comprehensive approach to this

problem."

“Just threatening a person who is addicted to meth with prison is not the
answer," Carroll remarked in a press release from Des Memes. “While these
individuals may need to be incarcerated initially, they must receive treatment
ifthcy are to escape the grip ofthis drug. They need to be confronted with
the seriousness oftheir condition. Hopefully they will reach out for help from
such programs as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.”

State Sen, Dennis Black, DrGrinnell, also has expressed strong support for

the oomprehensxve anti-meth effort.

Some ofthe provisions likely to be signed into law by the'govenror

include: .

- Imposition ofa 99-year
sentence for ﬁrstrcffense meth
manufacturing or sale to minors,
with the person convicted serving at
least IO years ofthat penalty.

- Life imprisonment for a
second offense.

. A stay in a residential facility
for someone convicted of making or
dealing a small quantity ofthe drug.
However, subsequent offenses

would mean time in prison. Drug testing also would be required,
. New constraints on a drug dealer‘s ability to obtain bail.
- Making tampering with anhydrous ammonia, a key chemical in mctli

manufacturing, a serious misdemeanor.

Initially, the governor and some lawmakers were proposing an automatic
life sentence for dealing meth to minors. But some legitimate questions were
raised about that idea, including how it would affect Iowa's alreadyrovcrr
crowdcd prison system: Changing that to a 99rycar sentence means that
parole IS still possible for a ﬁrstrtimc offender. It will be up to the courts to
determine whether a life sentence for a sccond ofﬁce passes constitutional ‘
muster, but at least there can be no mistaking the determination ofstatc
orﬁcrnls to make things as painful for pushcrs as possible.

It's important, too, to recognize that the agreement goes beyond punitive
measures. It also would earmark b] .5 million to enhance treatment for meth
addiction, Another 860,000 would go toward establishing two new drug
courts in the state, and $30,000 would be spent on developing a program
model for use in drug education by private-sector employers.

Also, the Iowa Department of Public Safety would be able to hire two
riiore laboratory technicians, and the department would receive nearly $1
million for developing new slrlke-fotec teams and $505,000 to hire six more

dnig agents

Is illlS overkill? Some Will say so. lt remains uncertain \vhcihcl thc level of

But tillS has been a big political issue, and there is no dcnying that what

The project is being supported by
the Human Assets Institute and one
dorscd by the American Public Health
Association.

“This project is important because
healthrservrces markets in the United
States and Europe have been too fo-
cused on health care and have missed
opportunities to broaden the scope of
services to cover healthy pursuits that
can pay offforindividuals, businesses
and communities in ways that go be-
yond what can be accomplished by

isbroadening the perspective on health
and testing those programs to see if
they improve economic and health

received $50,000 in developmental
assistance fromthcinstitute.Thc funds

Cooner has been designated by the
instituteasthecoordinatorfortthrin-

with Poweshiek County leaders about
the project will begin this spring.

“We selected Poweshiek County as
the best American rural site for such a
study,"Nordlnesaid.“Theinlerestsof
