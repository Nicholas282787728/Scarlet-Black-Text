Uriah Melchizedek ’01 describes
himselfas “a simple country boy who
doesn't want a lot offancy things out
of life."

This, despite his involvement In a
number of groups and projects both
on and off campus this year.

Melchizedeks participation in last
year’s l—iub festival, where he played
with his band johnchristinautiah, in»
spired him to coordinate the second
incarnation of this acoustic music
event, which took place la5t weekend
at Bob’s Underground. The event
wentwell this year, he said, citing high
attendance. “Everyone is really enthu-
siastic and cool about it . . . It’s a fun
time," he said.

spring vacation this year will pro-
vide Melchizedek an opportunity for
outreach as he co-leads an Alternative
Break trip to Boston.

“I’m a service oriented person, even
though I don’t have time to do service
here at Grinnell," he said.

Alternative Break is important,
said Melchizedek, because it's “good
to go out into the real world and see
what’s really important, which is
people.”

Melehiaedek’s dedication to service
is evident even in his choice ofmajor:
Economics. “1 like to see how money
screws up the world,“ he explained, “so
maybe in my life I can do something
to change that, or at least alleviate it."

Despite Melchizedelt’s busy life, he
has described himself as “an average
Grinnellian. I think of myself as
unique in the way that everyone I
know is unique. Nothing less, nDLl'I»
ing more.”

lead to a different conclusion.

in the i970s, his parents joined a
religious commune. They changed
their last name to Melchizedek, after
a priest who appears in Genesis and
Psalms, to reflect their ideals.

His parents named him Uriah,
Melchizedek explalned, because “they
are spiritual people” , it means “God’s
light is with me."

with the name Uriah, we was “ptce
destined to have God be a pretty ts—
sential figure in my life," Melchizedek
said. This religious background is re»
flected in Melchieedek's present pri-

orities: “I just hke to keep things

Grinnell College is a little haven
ofidcalistn; a sweet, unassuming, quiet
institution that somehow-got trapped
in a time warp and created its own set
ofsocial norms that are almost com-
pletely incongruent with "the teal
world."

Amongst these social norms here
at Grinnell is the one that says nobody
should care about the green stuff; and
ifthey do, god forbid they should ad.
mit it for fear ofbeing tarred and feath-
etcd and possibly dragged through the
town, forever branded a capitalist pig.

But let’s face it; the cold hard trudi
of the matter is that love doesn't make
the world go round and you certainly
can't exchange hugs and losses for a
bag of groceries, let alone a free ride
through graduatesehool. The bottom
line here folks, is money. Yeah, that's
right, I said it. i even put it in print.

Money makes the world tick. it’s
not everything but it sure has its ad-
vantages and is a definite means to a
lot of our endsi like furthering our
education, for example. Ever won.
dered how many scholarships and
grants the college offers? The answer
might surprise you. There are scholar»
ships, academic awards, internships
and grants for every major department
in college, be it chemistry or music.

For instance, the Barry M.
Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence
in Education foundation is for stu»
dents interested in pursuing a career
of mathematics, the natural sciences
or engineering.

The scholarship was established by
Congress in 1986 and, in order to be
considered for an award, students must
be nominated by their institution,

In April 1999, the foundation will
award scholarships to students who
will be college juniors or seniors dur»
ing the 1999-2000 academic year. It
covers expenses up to $7,500 a year.

“I am doing this because I want to
create. Reading a play is sometimes
incredible, but for the full effect ofit,
it is necessary to see and feel it. And I
want to create lives from the text ...be-
tween the emotions and music ofthis
piece, 1 think people will be moved to
something," said Marcus Moran, ‘99.

One of two seniors participating

in advanced directing projects this
spring, Moran is directing “Northern
star" by stewart Parker, which will be
performed April 29aMay 1, a play
about an irishman who is spending the
last night with his girlfriend before he
is executed for treason.

“i like the conflict in MeCrakcn
[the main character] throughout the
play as he struggles between what he
believes to be his dutygto 'untie the
Irish Catholics and the Protestants and
drive out the Brits—and his famil "
said Moran. Likewise,Theo Ben, ‘99.
is directing “Curse if the starving
class” by sam Shepard and will run
April 16-18.

“This show involves: nudity, a live
lamb, and lotsofscreamingpeople. it
is funny, it is sad, and it deals with is»
sues that strike very close to home for
some people," Ben said. “The phrase
lusc is ‘American HyperrRealismf that
is to say, the actualization and celebra-
tion in theatre and film or the hard-
ship of everyday life in this country
spanning many years in thelivcsofthc
characters and condensed into two
hours on stage."

He added, “Another part rbout
theatre that is important is timingand
to that end i think that Grinnell Col»
lege is an excellent forum for the ideas
in this play, there is a good talentebasc
(superb really) at the moment... the
text gives the company a lot of room
to play, and i really like being able to
experiment without damaging the in-
tegrity orthe script

ironically, Moran fools that two of
his history classes were actually more

inﬂuential in his interest in tlicaterand
directing than any ofhis specific the.
aver classes.

“The ideas of the past and die drive
ofhuman desire showing up in texts
and letters really makes me think
about characters and what it means to
bewho we are," he said. “it is the char-
acters that each actor creates that
makes a play incredible... the charac-
ters make it all come together and be
important to the audience."

bott, however, saw his theater
classes as having the most impact on
his ability as a director.

“A director, as I see it, also needs
to be a designer, an actor, a stage man-
ager, an electrician, a dramaturg, and
a producer. So the more you know
about how theater works, the more
you’ve read and thought about the
betteryou are at directing," said Bott.

Both Moran and Boo claimed to
have been interested in directing for a
least a few years, and Bott's past expc»
rienceswith the theater have also been
a main source ofinfluence.

“By far the best experience for me
outside ofclasswas working this sum-
met on Grinncll productions should

Toxfirex The director, Rod Caspcts,
is one ofrhe most phenomenal direc-
tors I’ve ever met... I got a tremendous
amount from watching him work...
the difference with Rodwas thnt (from
taking classes and reading about the
craft) 1 had the vocabulary to converse
with him and the experience direct-
ing to understand the “whys ofwhat
was going on onstage," said Bott. “I
think my directing is influenced by
just about everything around me. it's
not the end-all ofmy existence, mind
you, but I tend to be a very visually
oriented personil m a sucker for sun»

To be eligible, astudcnt must be acut-
rent sophomore or junior, have a B
average, stand in the upper fourth of
the class and he a U.S. citizen.

The leanne butkchvvard is made
each year at commencement to a sec
niot woman student who has made the
greatest contribution, academically or
non.academically, to the cause of
women during hcr tenure at Grinnell
College.

This' Is a cash award that was es-
tablished, as the name suggests, by the
Burkle family in 1986 in honor of
Jeanne Butkle, who was on art histo-
rian, a lecturer in religious studies, a
wife, a mother and an activist.

The Hill Awards offer ﬁnancial
help for musicians, providing partial
music lesson fee scholarships for the
current year ofstudies. students need
to prepare up to six minutes ofmusic,
which may be either excerpts or com»
plere movements and accompanists are
provided ifso desired.

A current list of scholarships and
grants is normally printed in the came
pus memo every week. So, with all
these opportunities available, why is
it that they seem unattainable?

For starters, students find it easier
to apply forstipends or grants for sum»
met research than to compete with
scores of other 3,8 cumulative GPA.

in contention for these types ofawards.

Grants up to 35,000 are available
fotstudents who have managed to 3:»
cute unpaid summer internships or
research projects.

Melissa Kempenaar '00 claims that
she would much rather apply for a
grant for her internship in Phoenix,
Arizona than to apply for a scholar—
ship, as she feels that chances of bei ng
awarded the former normally exceed
the latter.

Richard Wemet '99 said that he
simply applied for aid by sending in a
personal statement, his grades and two

letters of recommendation. Wcmer
was paid by a stipend and not a grant
or a scholarship.

lsott also expressed how important
communication is between the direc-
totand every other memberofhis cast
and crew. “You have to know how to
talk to people to express your ideas...
a good production should be the re»
sult of the combination ofeveryone's
opinions," he said,

Jesse May, “02, a member of
Moran's cast, was enthusiastic about
having a student director.

May “it’s fun to see his neuroses pap»

Moran. “You start oft with a book
