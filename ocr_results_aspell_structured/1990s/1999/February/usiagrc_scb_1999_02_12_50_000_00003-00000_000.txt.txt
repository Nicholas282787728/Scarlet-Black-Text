BY NICHOLM JOHNSON
SraffWrircr

Ed Tews's '99 idea ofwhzr consrirures a
possrais is a lisslc differens shan mosr,

Tews, a visual ars major, has broughs his
unique perspeesivc on porsraiss so his role
as curaror of rhe currenr arr show at The
Forum Terrace Arr Gallery, ”Porrralrs De-
picsing she Essence.”

“I shink ofa porssais as being very widely
deﬁned...rendesings, lighs ploss, whas-
everia drafsing is a possrais or a ses," Tews
said. I

This broad deﬁnition ofwhar consrirures
a porssais explains she diversisy ofshe pieces
currensly on display in she gallery. The show
currensly feasures abous 20 pieces from vari.
ous assisss who used everyshing from chore
coal m camerz§ ro campurers To design their
porrrairs.

Tews said he firss gos she idea ofdoing a
posssais show while raking pass in an off-
campus asss program in Chicago lass semes—
res. During his sime shese, he and oshes par»
sicipanss were given she oppossunisy so
decorase she program's small gallery; she
variesy of pieces submissed by she arsisss
gave Tews she idea shas a show as diverse as
”Porrrairs" would be possible,

“[Deeorasing she
gallery in Chicago] had
a feel shas everybody
wansed so be creasivc
and everybody fels shey
could be creasive. is was
a really good feeling
rhns I’d like so bring so
shis campus," he said.

Tews's idea seems so
have become a sealisy—
ereasivisy abounds in
she show. Viewers can
find numerous rmdie
sional porsraiss in is as
well as poems, phoro»
graphs and ”Swear
Code," a porsrais wrir-
sen ensisely in compuser code by a friend
ofTews‘s.

Tews said making she show a eurased one
was an assemps so help sssmulasc she cre—
asivisy ofmore of she campus communisy.

“The reason I'm doing a cusased show is
I'm srying so ges a larger group ofpeople in
Grinnell so parsicipase in she ass gallery,”
Tews said. “The gallery is oisen perceived
as being someshing shas only ass majors can
show in...and I don'i shink is is,”

His hopes for diversisy ofpresensers has

paid off Arr majors, non-arr majors, fac»

uisy, and alumni all have works hanging in

she show.

The wide variesy of arsisss who submir-
sed works gives she show a unique feel. “A
los of people may look as shis parsicular
show like playing lissle league sofsbali in
Wrigley Field,” Tews said. .

Alrhough Tews did have a number of
submissions for she show which opened on
February a, he said he is ssili looking for
more. ssudenss, faculsy, and ssaff are web

come so submis any works shas shey eishes
creased or own and shas shey reel conssi.

“Anyone can sack up sheir work wher»
ever sliess is open space on she walls," Tews
said.

For rhosc wansing so view she show
