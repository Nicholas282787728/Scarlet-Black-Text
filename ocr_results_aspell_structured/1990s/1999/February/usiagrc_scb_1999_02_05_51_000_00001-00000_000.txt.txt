workers are embarking on an effort to

Consumer advocate sets series of meetings on topic

State study foresees 63% increase
in electric rates for Grinnell area

By JOHN BREEMER

News/opinion editor

A multi-ycar study by the Iowa Of-
ficc ofConsulncr Advocate has led to
the conclusion that Grinnell users of
electricity may be facing a 63 percent
increase in their power bills.

And it'saﬁgurethat AlliantEncrgy,
which provides gas and electrical ser
vice to Grinnell, isn‘t denying.

The Ofﬁce of Consumer Advocate
(OCA) Is a division of the Iowa Der
partmentofJustlcethatrepresentsconz
sumers and the public interest before
the Iowa Utilities Board.

ActingOCAGaryStewarthassched-
ulcd a series of public meetings in
central and southern Iowa to discuss
his ofﬁce’s ﬁndings about the likely
effects ofwhat is being called electric
restructuring, another term forderegur
lation.

Newton meeting Feb. 16

One of those meetings is set for 7
pm Tuesday, Feb. 16, at the Newton
YMCA, 1701 S. 8th Ave. E. Other
sessions will be held Feb, 8 in Ot~
tumwa, Feb.9in Burlington, Feb. I l in
CenterVille and Feb. 17 in Osceola.

In a prepared news release, Stew-
art’s omce declared: “According to
the OCA, residential and small—busir
ness customers in Alliant Energy's
southern zone will likely experience
the largest pncc increases if electric
restructuring is ldopted in Iowa. The
OCA believesth tt residential custom~
ers in this zone c )uld see their electric
bills go up by 63 percent. Small busi-
nesses, churchel'and schools in the
area could see their electric prices in-
crease by morc than 50 percent."

The “southern Zone" to which the
OCA referred is roughlythc samearea'
onceservedbylowa Southern Utilities
prior to that company's merger with
Iowa Electric Light and Power ofCe-
darRapidsintowhatbccamelES Utili~
ties.

Rate request ﬁled

When that merger was completed,
has quickly ﬁled a request to increase
rates by a substantial amount, and that
move drew howls of protest from the
former Iowa Southern customers who

behevedthey were being punished be-
cause oflowa Southem’s efficient op-
crations 7 and because Iowa Electric
customers were paying higher rates.

The Iowa Utilities Board sided with
the consumers, rejecting the IES re
quest.

in I997, another merger took place,
and IE3 became a part of Alliant Err
crgy. Not long after the time of the
mcrgcr's consummation, however, .
basc electric rates were frozen at their
current levels for a fourryear period.

That freeze began in 1998 and will
expire in 2002, and it is then that a new
request fortateincreascsisanticipated,

No legislative action yet

The OCA hasbeenstudyingthc con-
cept ofrcstructuring for several years
Although the Iowa Legislature has yet
to act on industry calls for deregula-
tion, it is possible that legislation in
thatarea will be introduced duringthis
session ofthe General Assembly, ac-
cording to Alliant spokeswoman Ann
Humbert.

“There’s been a working group try-
ing to build a model ofwhat we would
like a deregulated market to look like.
and we hope that is close to comple-
tion," Humbert told The Heraldrkeg»
ister Friday.

Humbert said the industry would
like lowa to detemnne its own system
for a “customer choice market." The
idea, she said, is that utility customers
would be able to choose the company
from which they. buy their electric
power, much as they can choose a
long-distance telephone carrier.

Rate disparity

Is the consumer advocate’s forecast
ofa 63 percent increase in residential
rates on target?

“That is about what the current dif-
ference is between the northern zone
andthe southern zoneprices." Humbert
said. “It’s a signiﬁcant differential
that’s developed. I can't say what is
likely to happen, but it’s unlikely that
currentratesinthesouthemzone could
be maintained,"

She added that Alliant was “sur-
prised by the OCA and disappointed
that they would try to dissuade people
at this point from deregulation."

AccessAir flights
off the ground

AccessAir, the new Des Moinesv
based airline run by former Grinnel-
lian Roger Ferguson, carried its first
passengers on Wednesday, Ferguson
announced last Friday.

Theairlinc’sfullﬂightschedulewas
scheduled to go into effect Thursday,
assuming that the US. Department of
Transportation gives ﬁnal approval.

AccessAir will ﬂy a pair orBoeing
737 jets between Dcs Moincs and the

Quad Cities area to New York and Los
Angclcs.

Initial service in Des Moincs will
provide two flights to new York most
days and one night to Los Angelcs. By
March, Ferguson said,the airline plans
to add a second Los Angeles night.

Iowa ofﬁcials are hoping that the new
airlincwillmeannlorecompctitivetickct

Moines International Airport.

 

Jury’s verdict on Web site
poses tough questions

Big First Amendment issues are rarely cut and dried, and perhaps that‘s the
beauty ofthe amendment. Tuesday’s decision by an Orcgcnjury that an anti-
abortion Web site that displayed the names and addresses of“buby butchers"
represented illegal threats surely will be appealed. The challenge in appellate
court will be to more sharply define what is and is not permissible under the

Constitution.

Thciury imposed damages totaling 3 | 07 million against those people who
designed the Web SItC and posted the names Jurors probably would have had
a tougher time making their decision ltad Illc Internet site not displayed 7
prominently 7 crosscdrout names that belonged to abortion providers who
had been killed. That led thojurors to conclude that the tactics represented

the threat orvrolciit death against
the providers.

Almost certainly, the appeal of
the verdict Will center on wltetltcr
lhc case anOIVCS a cunailment of
the Web site dcsigners‘ right to
tree expression under the First
Amendment. No one can deny
that proclifc actiVists huvc every
right to pursue their cause, using
any medium available to them.

The question is whether crossing offthc names of dead abortion providers
goes too far. implicitly encouraging anti-abortion violence and even murder.
That's what lheyury concluded, although it took four days ofdclibcrztlicn to

do 50.

An appeal ofthe verdict is important, because this is the sort oflssuc that
needs to work its wily through the c’ntircjudicial system, all the way to the
Supreme Court. It is vital that the couns cstablish what is and is ttol pcmlis-

siblc in this highly emotional debate.

“We would like to give customers a
choice," she said,

Thc OCA‘s Gary Slcwart said that
the estimated $114 million increase in
rates would be compounded by other
costs.

“This s] 14 million does not include
the countless millions ofdollars it will
cost lowans to change the existing in-

dustry stnicture," he said.
