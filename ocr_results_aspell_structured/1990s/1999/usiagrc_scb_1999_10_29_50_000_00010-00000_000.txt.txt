Dear Saltv

I’ve been with my
boyfriend for almost a
year and I love him. He
says that I am scared of
commitmcnr and I admit
that I wish I had dated
more people before we
gor rogerher. I iusr don‘r
know what to do,

Scared

Dear Seared,

commirmenr is fnghrening, even love is awe—inspire
ing. But if you rruly love him and your relarionship is
working rhen I don't see any reason ro dare orher people,
lfir isn'r broken why for it?

I rhinlr you also need ro undersrand your fear ofcome
mirmenr, idenrify whar iscausing ir, and chen ler it go.
What exactly seares‘you abour commirmenr, and is rhe
love you have for him worrh rhar risk? For example, " I
have a fear of loss, bur I love him enough rhar I wanr ro
risk losing him rarher rhan nor having him ar all." (Excuse
rhe possessives.) Ifrhis relarionship is worrh ir and you are
happy wirh him, rhen you need ro idenrify your fears and
decide rhar rhe relarionship is worrh rhe risk so you can
ler rhe fears go.

Take care,

Sarah Liebman

Dear Scatcd,

Hon, whar’s so scary abour commitment? You afraid
you're going ro miss our on somerhing, or should I say
someone, better? The grass ain'r always greener on rhe
orher side. Yes, by commirring yourself ro rhis person
you will miss che op porruniries ofdaring orher guys, maybe
wonder “What ii?" wirh thc cure Romeo living down rhe
hallway from you, or have ro make saerihees. But, so
what! Irs love, nor poison. I'm being a_bir biased. It's
normal ro feel like you’re missing our on somerhingwhen
you’re with someone. But like I said before, rhe grass is
nor always greener on rhe orher side. If you decide to
break up with rhis guy, you’ll be free ro dare orher men.
but you may end giving up someone really special. I’m
nor saying you have ro commir to rhis guy; I’m iusr rrying
rosrress how norsearyeommirmenrcan be, Iwillsayyou
have ro sir down and acrually analyze your relarionship
wirh rhis guy. Ask yourselfwhar you wanr. Do you feel
comforrable wirh rhe idea of being wirh rhis guy, or do
you feel rhe need ro resr rhe warers by daring orher guys?
Consider rhese ouesrions and orher rhings that come ro
mind in remis ofyourself, rhe relarionship, and why you
have rhis feat ofcommirmenr. It may rake rime to figure
ourwhar you wanr, but I srress doing iusr rhar before do.
ing anyrhing drasric rhsr will affeer your boyfriend and
your furure rogerher.

Grinnell Owes Me SomeiMaid Cash

By Amanda DeSimone

over rhe years, I have heard many a woeful rale cone
eerning student loans. Fot example, I have one friend who
will ulrimarely owe $80,000 for having rhe privilege ofar.
rending Grinnell College. Such is nor rhe case wirh me. As
far as I know, rho only rhing I eould possibly owe rhis col-
lege is a swih kick in rhe ass. I shall have my people deliver
rhis in full ifI don't receive rhe money Grinnell owes me by
May 22, 2000.

To make marrers easier, I’vc Iisred Grinnell's debr ro me
by caregory. Keep in mind rhar rhe following are only
charges ro dare.

Dining Halls ($800 for antibiotics)

Mosr people don’r fear anyrhing more rhan chronic vom-
iring as a consequence ofearing in rhe dining halls. I, how»
ever, have done my research and have locared rhe cause of
my many rhroar and sinus infecrious- rhc juice machines.
Each rime someone goes up ro ger a refill, rhcy press rhcir
saliva—coared glass againsr rhe black lever. In orher words,
over rhe course ofa single meal, hundreds of distasc-in-
fesred mouths spit rheir foul venom onto rhe publie juice
dispensers So every rirne I innoeenrly gor a refreshing bev—
erage with a clean glass, I inadverrenrly exposed myselfro
infeerious bacreria. I had rhoughr rhar I could ﬁght my
ailmenrs by drinking orange juicc, never once suspeering
that I was acrually ingesring a new srrain of bacreria with
every glass, Since rhe dining halls are responsible for rhis
blaranr disregard for my healrh, rhey owe me for rhree years
worrh ofmerhadone.

Facilities Management ($1200 for services rendered)

I have cleaned every one-person barhroom on campus
on numerous occasions. Conrrary ro whar PM may believe,
I have nor performed rhis service in rhe spirir of ehariry.
The following is a deseriprion oi my rypical on-campus
bamroom experience. I go inside rhe ARH diitdefloot barh-
room and close one door, planning on using rhe faeiliries.
Once inside, I am so disgusred by rhe srare of rhe bath—
room rhar my firsr insriner Is ro ger rhe hell our of rhere.

However, people have already seen me go inside, and rhe
next person in line will narurally rhink Iwas rhe offender.
Thus, I spend a good halfehour disinfecting rhe enrire
room. over rhe years, I’ve spenr ar Ieasr 200 hours cleane
ing college barhrooms.

The Junior Class ($2250 for being so damn annoyr
mg)

I rhink I've made myselfprerry clear. you‘ve annoyed
me from rhe momenr you srepped foor on rhis eampus
rwo years and two monrhs ago. You’ve been both hard on
my ears and on my eyes. Each one ofyou owes me $5 for
having had ro rolerare you for rhree long years. There will
be no exceptions. Except rhose ofyou who are bigger and
srronger rhan me_I've enioyed your company very mueh,

The Train (1 com ior smushing my penny)

My firsr year or Grinnell, I ser a penny on rhe rrain
rraclcs because I rhoughr u would be cool ro have a flar-
rened penny. And it was cool for abour an hour. Then I
learned rhar I couldn't use a flarrened penny ro purchase
anyrhing. In rodays marker economy, a liar penny will
buy you norhing. Therefore, I would like rhe railroad in-
dusrry ro replaee my goodfonnorhing. flar penny wirh
one rhar has purchasing power. ,

President Osgood ($1500 for services rendered)

You said you'd pay me $250 every rime I menrioned
your name in my column, presidenr Osgood. I've made
you a supersrar, Ptesidcnt Osgood. President Osgood, you
owe me $1000 for rhis eolumn alone.

Saran ($32 for srealing my ball)

Sophomore year, you charged me $32 for a “losr” soar
eer ball, an amounr rhar was auromarically deducred from
my conrinuing enrollmenr. I=irsr ofall, Saran, I know ir
was you who hid my ball in rhe foresr nexr ro rhe lane
springer arhleric field. And, moreover, Isaw rhe same soc.
eer ball or Wal—Mart for 35.66, Why do you hurr me,
Satan? I’ve always been low] ro you.

The People’s Elbow

-New course offerings should aid stagnant s'econd semester
By Paul Pender

Bowing to criticism that the course packer
released Monday was Simply a te-hashing of
previous year’s offerings, college ofﬁcials have
given their approval to an exciting Slate of
new classes. The new Course offerings were,
as one adminisrtator put it, “desperately
needed to spice up our curriculum . . . I
mean, hell, all we down here at Fell House
did was Call up the ﬁle from last year and
print it out again." Are these meager Changes
a case oftoo litEle too late, or can these new
options provide hope for the upcoming se-
mester? Hopefully, Change can do us all good.
