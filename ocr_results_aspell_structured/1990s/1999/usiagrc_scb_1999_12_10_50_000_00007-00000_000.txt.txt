rhar Public safery ofﬁcers are
"rrained and cerriﬁed police pro-
Fessionals” who are currenrly nor

Public safery omeers are prima—

"We ralired With people on

Governmenr Presidenr Nick
Arnold.

UISG Presidenr Lana Zak said

"They're lsrudenrsl feeling

rhere is nor a good reiariooship be- '

rween srudenrs and rhe Departs

"The idea or having an armed
police ofﬁcctwith a gun in his hoi-

it‘s absolurely unnecessary."

"Publie sarery has a lor orcon-

Zak said. "I'reei rhe police and
Publie sarery would be able ro

Arnold said rhar's nor rhe case

"There may have ro be some

The UNI srudenr group was
approached by UNI Public safery
ar rhe beginning oirhe {all semes-

students rhoughr abour rhe issue.

"our job is becoming more
and more risky," UNI Public

ir s

lowing Public safery orﬁeers ro
carry ﬁrearms.

"1 door think rhe administra»
rion really cares wharsrudenrs or
rhe universiry communiry think,
and rhar's a shame," he said. "I
cannor believe rhere would be any
public policy allowing ill»
equipped otﬁcers our ro handle
law enforcemenr." .

UNI Presidenr Roberr I<oob
could nor be reached for com-
menr, bur UNI Vice Presidenr
John Conner said rhe enrire ad-
minisrrarive oabiner is opposed ro
Public Safety ofﬁcers carrying ﬁre
arms.

"The srudenrs are enrirled to
voice rheir opinions, bur we do
nor agree," he said. "we do nor
see rhem as police. They provide
public safery. nor enforcemenr.
We rry ro srress, 'Don‘r makc a
siruarion worse by inserring your.
self with a weapon: They inserr
rhemselves in siruarions rhey don't
have re."

The regenrs have rhe ﬁnal due
cision on wherher campus police
forces gerguns, said Regent David
Fisher. and rhey have been unwill-

ing ro discuss ir ar mecrings.

"Ir's nor even going ro come
up on the table," he said. "At this
poinr in rime, rhe board oven
whelmingly supporrs rhe currenr
policy -» I don‘r see a need, and
the administration doesn't see a
necd."

U1 Public Safery Direeror
Chuck Gtecn said he didn't think
rhe regenrs would supporr any
campus police force earrying guns,
but h: was picmed that UNI stu-
denrs recognized rhe dangers of
Public Safety oHicets' jobs.

"I don'r think ir's going ro
make a dent," he said. "It's not
going ro ehange rhe siruarion in
rerms or ofﬁccrs carrying lerhal
sidcatms. It is important that it be
known that oFﬁccts risk Lhcir lives
{at individual communitics and
are indeed police oﬁiccrs.“

But rhar may not be known ro
everyone making decisions.

"Thcy' re nor police; rhey' re se
curiry for rhe universiries," Fisher
said. "It's much different. Some»
rimes rhey ger in rhe same situa-
rion, bur rhey have differenr re»
sponsibiliries.
