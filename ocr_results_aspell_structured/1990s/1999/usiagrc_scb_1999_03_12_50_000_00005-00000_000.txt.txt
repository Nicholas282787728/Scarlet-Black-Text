After over one hundred hours or
rehearsal time, the 37eperson cast and
crew orMaclrerl is ready to take to
the stage for rive sold-out perfor-
mances this weekend.

Performances run Thursday
through sunday at a pm, with an
additional matinee performance Sat-
urday at 2 pin. in Flanagan Studio
Theatre, Bucksbaum Center for the
Arts.

Under the command or Director
Ellcn Mease, the Grinnell production
otMaclrerl has sought to take a more
humanistic approach to the tale.

“Don’t expect to see your “typical’
Marbtth, ”Warns Stage Manager Clara
Rice ‘99. “Ellen, the cast, and the
crew have created something much
more intimate, much more human,
than that, something that builds on
personal interactions between charac-
ters and runs the gamut ofemotions.”

David Nunez “01, for instance,
plays Malcolm, the eldest son orl<ing
Duncan. “This character, and many
orthe good characters in this play has
historically been ignored since the fa»
cos of the play is so much on evil,
however this production attempts to
get a really strong sense orrhe powers
of good that arise to dcfeat the
Macberhs," says Nuncz.

one aspect which has been chala
lenging tor the east is the staging con-

‘ cept ofMoclriIi. The modern slag»

ing—the staging in the round, with
no set, and with actors seated around
the circle at all times~is a device {or
us, the ensemble, to carry the energy
or the play purely in our bodies and
expressions," says Donovan Sherman
‘01, who plays Macbeth. “This is the

most rewarding, but also scary, aspect
ortheshow. Iguess you could say it is
what I’m most scared about."

Another unique feature oIMntlrti/r
is the involvement orrhe east through.
out the production. “This particular
production is
very different
in that the cast
involvement is
very high, we
have minimal
set and prop»
erties, the cast
handles the
sound effectsi
and most of
the company
is present for
thcrnajorityor
the show." says
Assistant Di-
rector Nick
Terpolilli ‘00.

Due to a
rigorous te—
hearsal sched—
ule through-
out the scmes<
ter, the cast is
thoro ugh ly
prepared for
performance. “These six weeks orre.
heatsal have been enormously satisfyv
ing forall ofus,” says Director Mease,

"These actors are bright, intmlivct
quick, focuscdiand what they might
lack in experience or technical train
ing, they more than compensate for
in their seriousness and eagerness and
intelligence."

In addition to Mcase's direction,
the cast and crew have benefited item

vocal instructor Ruth Chiids “94, as
well as guest costume designer Kathy

To gauge the success of the show,
the cast will depend largely on audi.
ence reaction and participation. “If
the audience feels the tuition oftl-ic
drama, then the performance will be
a success," says Tcrpolilli.

“As far as I’m concerned, the play
is already a success," says Rice. “My
hope is that the audience will come

play: the interactions between good

The movie reminded me ora great

rend against it, not if they wanted to
live. And scent entered their very core,
went directly to their hearts and decided
for good and all between aireccion and
contempt, disgust and lust, love and

I sense I’m getting carried away, so
lest this rambling turn into a lengthy
review of Des Potato, I’ll get to the

A Tale Of 'l'WO LOlIl'OS Glenda Vickery

Lolita (1228)

Playing Friday at 7:30, Saturday
at 2:00, and Sundayat 3:00 in Har-
ris.

Adrian Lyne's version or Lolita is
ﬁnallyrelcascd on the big screen after
long censorship debates and settling
for a cable premiere showing. Inter.
nationally, the debate concerning cen.
sorship or LII/(ta centers around
whether Lolita condones pedophilia
by presenting a pedophile as a likable
character. I think the nauseating fact
is that (given the number or child
sexual abuse cases) many or us have
relationships or one type or another
with pedophiles (considering how
youraverage neighborhood pedophile
doesn’t advertise or announce the per.
version). I say kudos to Lyric (and
Vladimir Nabokov, the author orthe
original novel, Lolita, which Lyne fola
lowed closely) rot providing us with
such a thoughtful and complex view
or this type or character and pervcn
sion. The ﬁlm is not the problem,
but rather is supposed to make you
thinkabout thisalreadyexisting prob—
lem orpedophilia.

Humbert (Jeremy Irons), a

middle-age man, becomes obsessed
with his fourteen yeanold pseudot
stepdaughter Lolita (Dominique
Swain). Lolira's mother Charlotte
(Melanie Grimth) dies suddenly, and
Humbert takes orphaned Lolita across
the country with him Thrown into
the mix is Quilty, another pedophile
competing tor Lolita's « -> Acting
and direction both get an “ except
rorMclanie Griffith, because she cant
stop talking like a baby).

While this pedophilic relationship
is disturbing enough, what’s perhaps
more discomfotting is the ironic dy-
namic between the two. Lolita issexu.
ally maturing (but obviously far from
being mature or adult) and is explore
ing her sexual power with Humbert,
who seems stuck in his life emotion-
ally as a victim. This iuxtnposition or
their roles asks the viewer to recon.
tilt the innocence and victimization
or a child with the fact that she ap.
patently initiates thesituatinnherselr.
This representation orpedophilia is a
particularly tragic one insofar as the
perpetrator is seen and sees himseiras
the victim lt invites the viewer to
distinguish the ideas that a child can

aslt for something they don't undetc
stand and be victim to an adult who
takes adVantage of their misguided
notions. And it points to a clear rault
within the pedophile or not being
willing to accept responsibility. The
direction places you in the disturbing
position oraddressing the ol' boy say-
ing, “she was asking For it," and thus
she deserved what she got.

But the tone oftlie film is not cn-
Irenchcd in heavy oppressor-victim
drama. We enter the story Irom
Humbert and Lolita’s perspective with
this beings romance, however twisted
and taboo, I found this approach scn-
sitivc and not too overbearing, leav-
ing room to reflect rather than emo.
tionally recoil. I don’t believe the Film
condones pedophilia in any way, but
iffor any reason any ofyou ﬁnd your
selrthinking this type orrelationship
is attractive rather than reflecting on
the complexity orits problems, I hope
you will heed that as a sign ofa prob-
lem Within yourselfand takes steps to
talk to someone about it at an early
stage. Grinncll does provide free
counseling

Lolita (12622

Playing Saturday at 8:30 pm. in
the Forum North Lounge.

This is the story of an old man’s
obsession with a young girl, or a pet
dopliilic romance. Stanley Kubrick’s
1962 version ofLolita is a dark coma
edy, straying further from Nabokov’s
text than Adrian Lyrics recent version.
Kubrick was much more constraincd
by censorship, so that LoIita‘s sexual-
ity is almost solely expressed through
facial shots or the use of double
cntendre. Though he altered the story
for its release, Kubrick's Lolita is a
thought-provoking, albeit funny ﬁlm,
and desetvcs more ofa review than I
am giving it here.

The acting is most notable with
James Mason as Humbertr Shelley
Winters as Charlotte, Peter Sellers as
Quilty, and Sue Lyons as Lolita. And
I don’t need to sell you on Stanley
Kubrick ifyou've seen any ofhis other
movies: A Clatkwark Orange, Dr,
Strangtlow, Full Meznljarktr, T17:
Shining, 2001, A Space Odysrey, etc.
