Men’s soccer goes fora title of its own

Men ready to make Pioneer soccer two for two

By Anderew Sherburne
Sports Writer

Somewhcrc amidSt the clamor
ofhearen kegs and disﬁgured pors
rhe words were spoken: “Onc
down, one ro go!" The women’s
ream has rheir conference rrophy,
now it’s time for the men to hoist

. rhe championship hardware over
their heads.

The Pioneers began rheir season
Sepr. l with a 1-0 vierory over vis-
iting Cornell College. But lfyouzsk
rhe caprains, rhe season started
aloonr a year ago when Gnnnell
dropped its lasr two eonferenee
games and wound up our orrhe
playoff pierure. They’ve been benr
on gerring re the posrseason since
then.

“Everythlng over rhe lasr year
has built towards this weekend,"

said Sam sellers ’00.

The pioneers work has paid off.
With mosr of rhe ream rerurning
frorn lasr year, and rhe addirion of
a freshman class rhar has proven it
can contribute, crinnell is poised
ro reclairn rhe Midwesr conference
crown.

Boasring a 7.2 conference mark,
rhe Flonccrs head inro rhis
weekend’s rournamenr as rhe num-
bct rhree seed. Thar means rhe ream
will rneer up wirh rwoairne defend—
ing eharnps Ripon, who handed
Grinnell 3 3»! loss earlier in the
year. A win Saturday, and rhe Plo»
neers would head re the clumpi-
onships where rhey’d mosr likely
meer up with Beloit.

Despire a reeenr losing sneak,
ineluding a 3.1 defear ar Nebraska
Wesleyan on Tuesday, rhe pioneers

have been very good in conference,
Besides the Ripon game, rhey’ve
outscored MWC opponenrs 204.

Led by co—eaprain Joel Fclkey
’01 and goalkeeper Davin oahl '01,
rhe defense hopes ro regain its form
from earlier rhis season when they
killed scoring chances herrer rhan
Rald.

Early on, rhe offense was hy no
means prolific hur always played
well, havrng some rrouhle purring
rhe ball in the ner

Willi 370 and 40 win: over
Knox and carroll respeerively, rhe
pioneers looked like rhey were be.

“We have been really hear up larely,
so rhis weekend is rhe firsr nme in
abour a .nonrh rhar we'll be ahle

sellers.

The resr, combined wirh
crinnell’s deep squad, should be a
huge hoosr to rhe ream. Therrball—

like a eheap eraser.

Yeah, rhar should do.

Purple Roos look to capture thirteenth conference title

By Andrew Sherburne
Sports Writer

There was a time when the Pier
neer hatricrs weren’t the dominant
team of the Midwest Conference
and a perennial regional conrender.
Then came Nike shoes and the
footwear revolution turned the Pio-
neers into a com peririve ream. Thar
and a former Olympian named
Will Freeman.

Under Freeman, Grinnell has
won 12 of the last 15 conference
titles. Tomorrow they look to add
their ninrh championship orrhe
dccadc and 13th under Frccnian.
The purple Roos, a name rheyseem
to prefer over Pioneers, are eurrenrly

let in the national NCAA-Dwr

sion lil rankings.

Led hyeaprainsiohn Aerni ’m,
Dan Madigan ’00 and Rob Park
’01, rhe Roos atci how should I
say thlsgecccnttici When asked for
eornrnenr, Park simply srared, “All
I. know is that I am a weasel.”

I'm nor going ro argue.

Other rhan rhe eaprains, Noah
Lawrence ’02, Matt shamey ’03,
Carroll Cottingham ’02, Marr
Prekker ’00, Casey Miller ’00 and
Jim Hackett ’02 are all eapahle or
toprli finishes, ifa runner plaees
in rhe mp 15, he receives alleeone
ierenee honors. in rhe hisrory ofrhe
eonrerenec, no ream has had eighr
all—eonferenee runners in one year
Plainly said, rhese runners expect

ro Win on sarurday; anyrhing less
and rhey'll be as disappoinred as a
“Blair Wirch Proieer” audienee,

“Conference in and otirselfwill
be a slaughrer," said Derek Wilke
’00. “Like the seals say, ‘It’s not ehar
we’re rhar good, as iusr rhar every.
body else is so bad.”

Well pur. But while the ream
irself may nor see much pressure,
Aetni and rhe orher Grinnell fronr
runners will have to look our for a
number oreonrenders.

“‘Young’ Zae Ftcudenbcrg and
Adam Broren most norably.’ con-
rrnued Wilke. "But ifViee presidenr
Aernr doesn’r eorne eorreer and loses
to any non—Roo, we should ime
peaeh his ass immednrely ”

Dwight D. Eisenhower, rhough,
was never impeached because his
powerhouse Army foorhall ream
lost ro Norre Dame in 1913, bur
rhere’s a fuss rime for anything.

Besides, Aemi and rhe Rods
seem to perform herrer under pres»

surprised a srrong Nebraska

would have edged Wesleyan.

you ask? Because rhere are orher

“The real race is herween Reid

Anyrhing else, Derek?

And I'd like ro give a shour our
