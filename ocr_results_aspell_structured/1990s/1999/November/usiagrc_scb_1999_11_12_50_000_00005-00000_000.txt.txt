marry and place rhe facrory under rhe conrrol of anorher
family's name. The woman is rrapped in her rcsponsiblli—

The movie has a sllck look to it, and often fccls more

ro appeal ro awesrcrn audience The rhemes it develops or
“forbidden love" and “unbridled passion,” as the advertis-
ers’ descripuon purs ir, are almosr laughably rypical or a
Hollywood rearjerker. (Wherher rhese conceprs are mean.
