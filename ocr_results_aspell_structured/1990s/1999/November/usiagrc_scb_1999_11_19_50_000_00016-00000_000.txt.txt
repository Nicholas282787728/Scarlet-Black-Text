But [0 think rhar rhere is no
rnerhod ro rhe madness is just plain
ignorant. Thar haskerhall anarehy
is the cteation of Coach David
Arseneaulr. Plain and simple, rhe
offense is designed to ereare open
rhree—poinr arrernprs.

Well, rhar‘s nor enrirely rrue_
rhey don’t always have to he open
shots.

over rhe past six seasons, rhe
Pioneer offense has been sueeess-
{ul enough ro posr NCAA seoring

JoiningPiitto and Hoehrnan as
