Movie Review: Eyes Wide Shut

By Zorka Milin
Staff Columnist

The very ﬁrst shot: Nicole Kidmari, her
back ro rhe camera, slipping our oia black
evening dress, suddenly she srands rhere nude
in possibly rhe mosr beauriiul image ever ro
open a ﬁlm. okay, i have a crush on Nicole
Kidman (and, for rhe record, l rind Tom
Cruise a srupid looking American boy wirh
big reerh). on rhe other hand, i've never been
a huge fan oFKubrick, andso I was ready so
be disappointed by his muchehyped ﬁnal
movie, bur l have ro say rhar ir is a rnily ex-
rraordinary, haunring masrerwork.

Ar rhe cenrer is a happily married couple,
rich New Yorkers, and whar you could call
Beautiful People. bur are rhey happy? The

srory is based on an obscure Ausrrian novel
Tr/nmmt'w/II, or “dream novel," by Arrhur
schnireler, originally ser in rin.de.siecle
Vienna, whose decadence is easily rransrerred
to America ar rhe end ofthc millennium.
You've probably heard people complain-
ing how rhe movie isn't as sexy as you'd ex»
peer. indeed, ir almosr seems rame cxccpr
fora son otnaked l<idman shors (which was
pleneyror me). orcourse, it’s impossible nor
ro menrion-rhe conrroversial orgy scene
which rhe MPAA demanded be digirally al-
rered for rhe raring ro be reduced from NC.
17 so R. The manipularion should be blu-
ranrly obvious even if you didn’t know ro
look for is. Digirailydnserred figures are con—
spicuously placed direcrly in from ofcopu»

laring coupies. By exposing rhe absurdiry of
the MPAA rarings sysrem, rhis episode may
help rosrer some overdue reform. Ar rhe very
lease it shows how American adulr movlego»
ers are rreared like children, unlike rheir Hue
ropean counrerparrs who can see Eyes wide

To a foreigner, rhis is iusr one more illustra-
rion orrhe idioric puriranism that continues
ro pervade American society (in Europe, even

Unforrunarely, rhe narrative is more To»

rhar Kidman is onscreen mosr of the rimc,
which is a shame, because her performance
