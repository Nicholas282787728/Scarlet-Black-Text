My inrerview wirh Vivek
venugopal ‘01 and John Aerni ‘01, our
next scA Presidenr and Vice.l>resie
denr, was a srrange mixture orserious
discussion abour currenr issues and
moments orbizarre dialogue.

one commenr led re a vision of
rlic enrire adminisrrarion and srudenr
body meering in a barrle scene much
like Bravchearr. Vivek rides inro Joiiir
Board on a horse wearing a kih wirh
halflris face painred blue yelling “They
may raise our srudenr Affairs sraff, bur
they’ll never rake our frecdoml" (Line
courresy ofrrcd Beukema ‘01).

iBur behind rhe Jokes are rwo

peoplewho have a srrong commirmcnr
'ro the improvemenr ofGrinnell Col-
lege.
. Vivek was born in Zambia and
lived rhere unril rhe age of eleven,
when he moved ro India, in August
1997 Vivek rraveled ro rhe United‘
States, bur Madras, india is home.

Mosr people ar crinnell have met
Vivek in one way or anorher He per.
forrns wirh rhe Grinnell singers, is
presidenr of 150, is a member or
ASIA SOL CBS Chalurzim, and
VISA, and ifyour compurer is acring
:up, Vivek is rhe uc ro call.

Vivek srill finds rime ro have hob-
bies such as reading, singing, dancing,
and goofing off When asked ifrhcre
was anyrhing he wanred his “public”
ro know he replied, “I dunno.,.whar
doesn’t rhe public know abour me?“

‘John is from Cincinnari, Ohio:

“your rypical American ciry. A lirrle
more conservarivc rhan average. bur
we did have Jerry Springer as our
mayor for rwo rcrms in rhe 1980's. "
Whar more can you ask for?
’ John is also involved in several or.
ganiearions such as rhe Arrcr School
Foreign Language Program., rhe [rack
and cross counrry reams, Cowlcs Hall
Senator, Srudenr Services commirree,
and rhe Election Committee,

He enjoys running and reading
when he has rhe rime. John hopes rhar
srudenrs will “come ralk ro me, I love
ro hear whar people have ro say abour
life on campus, abour issues on cam
pus, basically anyrhing."

The basis ofrhc rraining for Vivek
and John’s new posirions is hands on
learning. John says rhar he goes “ro
mosr ofrhe meerings wirh rhe currenr
Vice Presidenr Jess Dvorak 99, sirring

in on Dean’s meerings, commirrce
meenngs and various random stuff,"

Vlvck’s rlaining will be the same
arrangemenr wirli rhe currenr Presi»
denr, Pcrar i<laersch ‘99, alrhough he
has nor yer had any mcerings for Vivek
to attend this week. \Vlien he does,
Vivek says he’s “going ro be starting
hardcore muerings with him,"

The plans Vivek and John pur
forth in their statements ofintent for
rhe improvemenr of Grinnell have
changed relarively llrrle. Vivek mainly
talked about the GCCS problems, and
town-gown relarions.

GCCS hopes that a Fund For Ex»
cellence proposal will solve rhe currenr
low sraffing problem, Vivek rhinks
rhar “ifthe Fund ror Excellence pro»
posal works out, which I hope it doesi
rhen rhcre’s dcnnirely going ro be an
increase in sraff, and a lessening ofrhe
computer problems."

He seemed parricularly oprimisric
abour his plans ror rhc improvemenr
of rho college and rown relarionship.
“I rhink next year lfwe had more ac.
riviries like [college/ high school
shadowinglarhar direcrly involve rhe
rown..,acrually gerring rhe srudenrs
involved with the students in town and
wirh rhe people in town, rhen rhings
would be much better.”

John remains focused on commu-
nication and the curriculum. He said
ofhis proposed weekly mcerings wirh
srudenrs in rhe dorms rhar “you'll just
ger a berrer sense ofwhar campus re»
ally rhinks on any issue we discuss be»
cause you're ralking ro a wider er035r
section.” .

He also recommended improve.
ment in the communication between
adminisrrarion and srudenrs suggesra
ing “more rwo-way communicarion
going on insread ofonc-way yelling.”

Both Vivek and John showed signs
ofundetstandable unease when I men-
tioned the recenr issucs about the de-
cision co cur rhe srudenr affairs posie
rions and rhe proposal for rhe Carri-
pus Budget Advisory Commirree, bur
borh carefully expressed rheir opinr
ions They agreed that, as John said,
“irresidcnr Osgood] rakes those Stu»
denrs who do agree wirh him, how
eversmall or large rhe number ofrhem
is, and he says ‘rhank you, i agree wirh
you,’ you know, ‘I lisren ro rhe stur
dent opinion.’ But I don’t think he
takes into account times when the
minoriry opinion rhar he agrees with
does nor reprcscnr rhar of Grinnell

campus."

Vivek expressed his frusrrarion
aboor his feeling “rlrar SGA as a repre.
senrarivc or rho srudenr body passed
rhose resolurions and more resoiurions
were dismissed son of oirhandediy."
He eoniinries; “ir's JUSI been kind of
rrusrraring because we’ve been rrying
ro work wirh rhc adniinisrrarion bar
we haven'r been gerring rlie feeling rhar
rhey wanr ro cooperare as much as we
do,"

The rwo also discussed how rhey
would handle rhe issue lfrhey were in
ofﬁce vivek said, “At rhis poinr, i
don't think there's much we can do
unril we acruaily ﬁnd our how rhe
campus as a whole feels,"

John agreed: “I rhinkrhe rime now
is ro lcr rhe srudenr body acrually
speak, i mean, SGA has done whar
rhey can do...Now I Josr rhink we need
srudenr input."

Vivek also rhinks rhar “lors ofrhe
srudenrs are nor inrormed on whar is
happening in rhe sense char [rheyJ
didn’t even know rhar ihesc posirions
were being our unril a bunch ofsru.
denrs pur up a cry abour ir. l’m nor
saying rhar rhe decisions rhcy made
were right or wrong. I’m saying rhar
when they make decisions ir should
be made known ro rhe campus coma
muniry as a whole."

Vivek and John are very optimise
ric abour nexr year and rheir furure
roles in SGA. Neirher roresees any real

problems berwecn rhe rwo ofrhcm,
and Judging by rlic way may inreracrcd
during rhe inrerview, ofren helping
each orher nnish rheir senrcnces, nei»
rher would any one else

Vivek is also enrhusiasric abour rhe
cabiner next year. “I think we're gonna
have a really good cabinor as well...we
have a really good group of people ro
sclecr from, and we're probably going
ro work really well rogerher. Especially
rhe rwo orus ‘cause John's a swell guy.
Quorc me on that...]OHN’S A
SWELL GUY.” John expressed simi-
lar feelingswiih, “Vivek: He da man ,,

They borh expect ro enjoy rheir
new posirions. “Oh yeah, ir's gonna be
a blast,” exclaimed vivek while John
a little more hesiranriy said, “I altctr
nare berween excitement and terror."

Turning more serious, Vivek con-
rinued, “I think rhe main issue rhar
we‘re going ro have to keep in mind is
that we're acring as an elecred srudenr
reptesentarivcmAnd rhar's going ro
rake a lor ofwork, bur I'm prerry conr
ridenr rhar we are going ro be able ro
do ir. And we're gonna have nun do.
ing ir, Dammirl"

Alrhough neirher could come up
with any one rhing rhey look forward
ro most next year, rhey had some ideas.
“Um, I don’r know, whar do you look
forward ro John? ofﬁce hours?" one
hardly expecrs office hours ro slow
down rwo such enrhusiasiic people.
