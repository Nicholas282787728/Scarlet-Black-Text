A View of the issue

as presented by the ad hoc committee appointed by Joint Board to clarify

the issue: Mackenzie Massman, Brandon Zicha, Elizabeth Fry, Molly
Kennedy, Walt Williams and Erin Drehobl

As representatives of the Grinnell College student body we have noticed the lack of accurate information regarding issues that are
important to the entire campus community.

The elimination of two student affairs positions and the events that followed highlight the absence of administrative accountabil-
ity to student concerns.

In our effort to more accurately represent student voices, we seek to illuminate the significance of the problems that have arisen.

The administration, as led by President Russell I<. Osgood, is not sufficiently accountable to students during or after the decision
making process.

Students were not consulted when the decision was made to eliminate the two positions in Student Affairs.

This brought to the foreground two additional issues: I) the lack of student input in major administrative decision making pro-
cesses, 2) the lack of student involvement in the formulation of Grinnell College’s annual budget.

To address the original problem of Student Affairs cuts Vice President and Dean for Student Affairs Tom Crady and Vice President
for Business and Treasurer of the College David Clay were invited to Joint Board. Key to their presentation was the finality of the
decision. Crady had made the decision based on budget constraints stemming from the FY1999 base budget. This base budget was

In an attempt to clarify and assess the situation, the SGA cabinet met with President Osgood on Tuesday, March 16. Later that
evening Osgood fielded questions about budgetary issues and the elimination of the Student Affairs positions. At this time it became

clear that Osgood was not open to change or compromise.

In the final analysis, students currently have no power in setting the broad agenda
and budget for the college. To begin to remedy this, we have proposed inclusion of
two students on the Budgetary Advisory Committee.

Our demands are not unreasonable, but at their core are issues affecting all levels of
student life at Grinnell. At stake is the continued viability of self-governance.

Student Initiative

Explanation of Issue

The past semester has brought to our attention that the administration IS not responsive to student
concerns as demonstrated by President Osgood's March 31 letter, indicating that he only supports
student opinions that match his own.

Initiative

We feel that his actions have silenced self-governance and the voice of the elected representative
body of SGA. By supporting his stance based on the expressed opinions of the few, President
Osgood has marginalized the expressed concerns of many.

Plan of Action
We would like President Osgood to publicly and tangibly take into consideration the majority

expressed student opinion.

Specifics: 200 signatures need to be collected in support of putting the initiative on the ballot.
Signatures will be collected Sunday dinner at Quad, Sunday at Southern Express, and Monday
lunch at Cowles. Once the signatures have been collected, voting will be Thursday at the post office
from 8-5, and outside dinner at Quad and Cowles. 50% of the campus must vote, and 2/3 of those
in favor for the initiative to pass

The initiative is sponsored by Sara Barr who is not part of SGA. It is being executed along the
guidelines of Article IV, section 2 of the SGA bylaws, which stipulates that:

”AN emergency initiative may be called anytime if the proposal sponsor collects 200 signatures and
the Student Services Coordinator deems the immediate vote necessary. 1P these conditions are met,
the Student Services Coordinator shall work as quickly as possible to bring the proposal to a campus
vote. In an emergency case some or none of the general guidelines may be applicable. The Student
Services Coordinator has the jurisdiction to bypass these guidelines unless overturned by a two-
thirds majority of Joint Board."
