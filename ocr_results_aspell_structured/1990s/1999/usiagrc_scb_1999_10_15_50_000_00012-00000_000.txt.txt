LDRs (long distance relationships)
from high school

I’m not die best adviser on the subject of LDRs
from high school because mycx was studying abroad
when we dated. In any LDR, whether It's high
school, college, or any other time in your lire, heing
totally committed involves communication. First,
he honest about your feelings. Second, he sure to
clearly deﬁne houndaries in seeing other people, and
stick to those boundaries so there is no distrust in
the relationship. Third, and most important, DO
NOT LIE TO THE ONE YOU LOVE. If you
haven't notieed, I stress the other two points out I wanted to
make the ﬁnal one crystal elear. what destroys almost any
relationship is lies! Okay, enough preaehing. What ityou
did follow these rules, (which is vcry commendable, sincc
LDRs are very hard to keep togetlier)> What should you
expect when you see your love for the ﬁrst time in at least

But once the hugging and kissingstops, you may go through
an awkward period with your signifieantother. According
to the people I surveyed. it will prohahiy he due to the raet

higger than lust needing to recap the last two months in
cash others lives; what irone otyou has changed? One or
