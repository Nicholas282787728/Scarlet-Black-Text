Grinnell students, following tradition,
find community spirit in many ways

By Courtney Sherwood
Editor~in»Chief

All it takes is a walk down the
loggia to discover that Grinnell
students are busy. Signs advertis-
ing book clubs, writers’ confer»
ences, cultural films and convo»
cations abound. The college
community offers a broad spec»
trum of divergences for those
seeking entertainment.

Yet look closely, and a pattern
emerges among many of the
signs: “Are you contributing to
the death of the planet?” one
asks. “Become a domestic vio-
lence alternatives/sexual assault
center volunteerl” another in-
vites. Still other signs urge fall
break community service, union
activism, or participation in an
East Timor handraising drive. it
this proliferation of posters is any
indication, President Osgood’s
assertion that Grinnell “main»
tains a strong sense of zeal and
social activism” is more than just
publicity-seeking hyperbole.

Indeed, students are involved
in improving their communities
and their world in a number of
ways. Last spring, for example,
Free the Planet (FTP) staged a
protest outside of Home Depot
to protest its use of old growth
forest lumber, a practice the COm'
pany has since vowed [.0 end. In-
ternationally, Fog Fast, the pro-
gram which allows campus
groups to raise funds for chariv
table causes, allowed students to
help survivors of Hurricane
Mitch last year, and will raise
money for humanitarian relief in
East Timor today. And within

the local community, students
raised over $500 to fight cancer
last weekend.

But does this social activism
derive from the values of our
founding fathers, a group of
Congregational ministers, as re
Cent publicity would imply? A
glance 20 years into the pasr
might lead to such a conclusion.
Perusing fall 1977 issues of the
Scarlet é“ Blade reveals articles

and editorials promoting inter—
national human rights, afﬁrma-
tive acrion and environmental-
ism, and opposing anti»gay and
anti—women movements in
popular culture.

Continue back into the 40’s
and 50’s, however, and it be»
comes clear that social Commit-
ment does not span Grinnell’s
153 year tenure in lowa. In
spring of1946, articles were cone

cerned with songs, concerts and
exhibits on campus; veterans
events and sporting news for
men, cooking and fashion advice
for women; one prominent fea-
ture anticipates the college’s
pram, another highlights an up;
coming horse show.

Thus while the college is cer»
tainly home to activists and the
socially minded today, this is not
a tradition Grinnell was born

into. International and local ser»
vice are instead the product of
growth brought about over re-
cent decades by students, not
their elders, and institutionalized
to such a degree that social com»
mitment has become a yardstick
by which we measure ourselves,
enshrined now by the adminis—
tration as a core value, ”our
strong tradition ofsocial respon—

' sibility and action."

Blood drive
needs student
donom

If you think giving blood
is inconvenient, imagine
needing it. Central Iowa
hospital patients rely on
volunteer blood donors, and
all blood types are needed.
Some people believe if they
have a common blood type
their blood is not needed as
much as rare blood types.
However, the most
common blood types, type
A and O, are used the most.
Also, in an emergency,
anyone can receive type 0
red blood cells.

All eligible donors are
invited to participate in the
Grinnell College blood
drive on Friday, Oct. 1, The
drive, sponsored by the
SGA, will be held in the
north lounge of the Forum
between 9 am. and 3 pm.

Those who are 17 years
of age or older, in general
good health, and who weigh
at least 110 pounds, are
encouraged to participate.
Potential blood donors are
also reminded to eat a good
meal prior to donation, Call
Amy Bailey at 269-3316 or
email service@grinnell.edu
if you wish to schedule an
appointment,

Mobile blood drives are
essential to the central Iowa
volunteer blood donor
program.

Buddies enjoy making friends with young

Grinnellians, Mentors prefer middle schoolers

By Sarah Alword
Staff Writer

It doesn't seem to surprise Lindsay Hagy ’00 thar
one ofher best friends is half her age. "[My buddy]
is amazing," Hagy said about her fourth-grade buddy.
"I feel really lucky to be able to spend time with
her."

Hagy, one of four coordinators of the Buddy Pro-
gram, has been meeting with her buddy for four
years.

The Buddy Program is a partnership between
Grinnell College students and local elementary kids.
Each big buddy is matched with a little buddy of
the same gender to talk, play, and just be Friends.

Even though the commitment is only a year long,
many partnerships have lasted over the years. "My
buddy and I started when she was seven, and now
she’s ten," Hagy said. "We’ve been through a lor to»
gether, and she’s always been one of the constants in
my Grinnell career. "

To become a buddy, applicants must be willing
to set aside two to three hours a week to meet with
their buddies. During this time, activities vary de-
pending on what the big and little buddy want to
do. There are also large group activities, which in
the past has included roller-skating, movies at Hare
ris, and a Dr. Seuss birthday party.

Straightening out all the misconceptions. the correct answer is 13‘. it's a concept we should all understand and remember, and here's
why. Depression strikes millions of young adults, but only 1 out of 5 ever seeks treatment for it. Too many just drag themselves along
or eventually seek relief through suicide. Why not treatment? Partly lack of awareness. Partly
the unwarranted negatrve stigma. This is what needs fixing. This is where we need you to
change your attitudes. it‘s an illness, not a weakness. And it's readily treatable.

kids, and there is an interview to get to know the
directors, The Buddy Program encourages all varis
eties ofpeople to apply, because there are always more
kids that want a college friend.

"Havinga kid with you onecttmpus
makes you look at everything differ
enrly," Hagy said. "My buddy loves to
come to the dining hall, and she wants
to go to college just to get what she
sees as free ice cream. Sometimes i go
eat lunch with her at school, and I feel
like a superstar, because all the kids
want to talk to you. They get all exp
cited, because someone is coming out
to have lunch just with them."

Hagy emphasized that the Buddy
Program is not supposed to sccm like replacement
for a parent. "This is a friendship, and it’s a two»way
partnership," she said. "Nobody is a problem child
or a charity case. Everyone can use a friend, which is
why this isjust as beneficial to the college student as
it is for the little buddy."

Emily Howard (01 is also one of the coordina-
tors of the Buddy Program. Through her involve-
ment, Howard has gotten a better sense ofthe Come
munity Grinnell has to offer. "Connecting wtth the
town is the most vital part ofliking the town," she
said. ”It’s nice to be able to go downtown or to com—
munity events and see people you know. It makes

the college less bubblcelike and more like a home-
town."

Howard got involved with the program last year
and has been meeting with her buddy nearly every
week. Having someone outside her
age group allows her see things differ»
ently than if she were inst surrounded
by college students constantly "Kids
see things in a more fantastic light,"
Howard said. "It makes you wonder
why people insist on maturity as a
positive trait in people, You realize
how much your priorities have
changed, and get a second chance to
decide if that’s what you want."

This year, there are fewer
buddies than usual at Grinnell. However, the nurn»
ber ofinterested students in the elementary schools
is increasing. All interested applicants are encoure
aged to get an application from the post office or
contact the Buddy Program through email.

"it’s never (or) late," Hagy said, "because there is
always a kid out there that would love to have a col-
lege student as a friend. The Buddy Program really
has changed my whole life here at Grinnell," she said.
Mentor program

Much like the Buddy Program, the
Mentoring Program pairs college students
with local kids to form lasting friendships.

However, the Mentoring program also deals with
academics, often some light tutoring as well as hang—
ing out together.

Matt Magee '01, one of the coordinators, has
worked as a leader of the program since his fresh-
man year. He got involved through the Community
Service Center, which set him up with a middle
school student who wanted a mentor.

"Our relationship is based on academics and
hanging out," Magee said. "It's usually some combi-
nation of the two for other pairs, depending on what
each child’s needs are. Some kids don’t have a chance
to work on their homework with their parents. some
kids get straight A’s but don’t have many friends. It
all depends on the individual.”

Middle school students are often encouraged to
meet with a mentor ifthey are having trouble with
their grades, or ifthey are getting into trouble. Also,
kids or their parents might ask to get involved.

On the other side, Grinnell students often par—
ticipate to get in touch with the surrounding com-
munity. According to Magee, lots of people decide
to get involved because they miss their little brother
or sister. "People love to hang out with kids," he
said. "When we spend time with them, they are so
