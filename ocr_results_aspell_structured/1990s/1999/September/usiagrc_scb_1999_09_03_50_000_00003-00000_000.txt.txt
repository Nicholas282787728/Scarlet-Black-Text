Big Mac dildcks Grinn

Chain opens lo large lines, ”mod rush

The tumors started around campus last
spring “'Is it true that McDonald's is com
ing to Grinnell?”

Though the town is already home to
five fast—food restaurants, the addition of a
McDonald’s was noteworthy, a tangible step
away from small town life.

Some Grinnellians cheered, others
groaned, but when the bright yellow arches
were seen from our cars as Students com-
pleted the journey to Grinnell College this
August, the rumor could be seen as a reality.

For Kelly Zoda, a resident Grinnellian
who lives in the countryside, this addition
to the local economy meant a new johi She
left her job at Fareway in the early summer
to accept a position at the Newton
McDonald's where she hemn training fortwo
weeks before the grand opening ofthc Grin—
nell location on rneJuly 19.

For Annette Saly from Gillman, the
Grinnell location is closer than the
McDonalds or Burger King in Newton It is
a special treat for her day- care kids, she said
The kids expressed their overwhelming apc
preciation for the Happy Meal toys, which
are currently miniature plastic Hot Wheels
cars. Also the new location is more conve-
nient for her, ”since i do my shopping here
in Grinnelli"

The Grinnell community members at—
tending the grand opening on the morning

ofJuly 19 reacted with competitive EXClIC'
merit. Everyone’s goal was to be the first
served.

Lucy Kaminsky ‘03, arrived at 5:50
am. with a friend and the intention of be»
ing in first. “I was here all summer and it
was pretty boring, so the McDonald's open—

Alocal radio station broadcast from the
parking lot and the DJ. gave away cos to
those in line.

The lines started at both doors and
stretched around the building.

“It was crazy, the parking lot was
packed," said Kaminsky.

The restaurant opened at 6 a.m., but
this apparently was not soon enough.

According to Zoda, who was working

the morning shift on that day, thtic were
seven or so lrightchoolcrs in thc walkuay,
[wirhl sleepingbags and pillows," who had

in line next to Kaminslty were .1 “high»
school student and an old man who was fat
and in overalls."

As the employees arrived rho man in
overalls divisivcly srcppcd to the rront oi‘rhc
line to hold the door open. “The boy he-
hind him asked, ‘vou'rc not going to go in
first, are you?’ because," as Kamiliksy exe
plained, “we had all been there before the
old man. The old man brushed him offend
rushed in before al
customer.”

According to Zoda, “The first order
taken was drive»thru."

But those who waited in linc, like
Kaminsky, or campedour over night, rolr
jilted.

“it was really pathetic,“ said Kaminsky.
“i don't know why he did that, and we were
all going like ‘It‘s not fair!”

Zoda did not remember a man pulling
to the front of the line. “There was an old
man in here, but he [is] the owner,” shc said.

Zoda maintains that those who

i ofus and he was the first

Camped»out were the first to order at the reg»
iSter.

“The first boy came in the door yellr
ing his order, ‘Two sausage MciVlurfnis with

as a “mad rush."

What part will Grinnell’s new
McDonald's play in the lives of the
majority or Grinnell students now
that the school year has begun?

Employee Kelly Zoda claims
that many college students eat at
McDonald’s, that with along with
those customers who are going to
work the ratio is “about half-and»
half.” However, she was reasonably
sure rhet no college studcnu are cur—
rently employed by McDonald's.

During a recent Friday luneh
rush, only one college student was
present. The restaurant was bustling
with middleegcd people dining alone
on their lunch break, elderly couples,
mothers and children, and the per.
ticipznts of a dayrrip from a local
adult cere facility

oteited about the new restaurant.
Shore made it clear that she did
not like McDonald‘s and does not eat
there. “I like to eat healthy food. and
I don’t think rhet McDonald's advo-
cates healthy eating.”

McDonald’s has a few positive as-

B u t ,

she ex-
plained, the
issue is not
the impact
of an indic

vidual McDonald‘s, but ”what

McDonald‘s implies,”

For short, the implications of
McDonald’s can be broken down into
three ideas.

The ﬁrst is the question of a
healthy diet.

The second involves mass con-
sumption and irresponsible environ.

okay to consume mass quantities or
meat products even ifthai means dc.
straying a rainforest for them," Shore
said,

Third, shore is worried about
the movement from “momnndpop
stores" toward corporate ownership.

“McDonald’s snps the idcnuty
from small tovvns by making them all
the same," she said.

“ [The town] becomes run by
big CEO corporate people and not
people who live in the town and un-
derstand the town. it maker it hard
to right for workers' rights because it
makes it hard to determlne who is
responsible" Shore specifically cited
thc concern of “badly paying iobt
with bad working conditions.“

Thus far there have not hon
any student attempts- ro deter the
corporatizntion or Grinncll. Shore
