To illusrrarc rhe lasr poini, Bradley rev

Al a loss for words, Bradley said, he bore

WebMail a mixed. bag:
students nostalgic for

dying VAX/Dreams system

By Mali Lorenz
Slafi Writer

Even as Grinnell siudcnrs learn io use webMail, resigning rliemselvos ro ihc inevirabiliry
of change, rhc demise of rho VAX operaring sysrem and die Dreams email program srill
srings In facr, ir is easy ro elicir senrimenrai preferences rorVAX from neariyanyone bur ﬁrst»
years

The “plan," a phenomenon wirh iis own culr‘ure rhar's dirhculr ro explain rully ro outside
crs, is one ofil ie niosi commonly lamcnrrd roariires ro dic- wirh VAX.

Reading and wriring plans has been a common procrasrinarion recliniquc, as well as away
ro posr iiserul inforinarion such is ones summer address or an organiearions meering time.

An alrernarive ro plans, which may become a pi-ocrasinarion sraplc of die furure, is a
pcrsonai web page, Grinnellians can reniiesr a page and ger free sofrwarc ro learn how ir
works, bur rhis dofinirrly is more iroubie ilian ilie old “edir plan ixr."

webMail cerrninly does have some fcarures rhar are grcar improvcmenrs on die VAX.

WayneTwirclieil. an lns'irucrional MulrimediaTechnology specialisr, believes rhar ”Sande
ing arrachmenrs is an imporranr educarional runcrion.” webMail will “irrimcdiarely send a
docunicnr [for example, a me from Word] wirli one burron click." lr can also arrach picrures,
somerhingenrirely incomprehensible ro rlie VAX.

Anorher convenience is rhar a web link rnenrioned in an email can be vicwed just by
clicking on ir. Using VAX, one would have is record rhe address and rhen open Nerscape.

chMail's roldcrs are useful; rlicy auromaucally rerain senr and delered messages for a
rime and allow one ro nrgani saved emails lr is also easy ro srarr a drafr ora message ro be
sear larer. A personalized “.rignarure" can be auromaricaliy added so rhc end oiyour emails.
Moreover, srudonrs don'r have re worry abour exceeding ilieir sofrquora, as on VAX.

srill, rhcre have been some bugs wirh WchMail. Dave Herman ’00 has noriced rhar on
Nerscape, if you resiae ihe window ora message you're woiking on, ir disappears, and rhe
“lirgcnr” normcnrion seems ro only \vnrl sporadically

Anorhei annoyance is rhir new messages are displayed in reverse chronological order
Herman poinrs our rliar rhc \Veb was simply nor inrendcd ior running programs. ir has ro
keep loading new pages as you swirch berween messages

Blaine Aron '0], like many people, acknowledges rhar ir‘s easier ro edir messages on
webMail. Srill, she feels rlierc is “kind ofa sad. parhcric empriness you encounrer when you
ger on webMail and you don'r have any mail, and rhere’s norhing else ro do.” she also
criticizcs rlic “inks lamewindows” rhar she can'r minimize A nice rhingabour VAX was being
able in scroll up and see previously displayed messages or files, insread ofiusr viewing rliem
one ar a nine in separare windows

Annc Peaalia 00 poinu our hpieuseful Vines "spy file was while slic was in China is
auioinarically lei licr know when her friends were logged on, and she could ralk ro rhem ror
free. “I love rhe VAX," slie declares

Wirh rhe “send" and ”ralk" capabiiiries of Dreams, one could converse live wirh friends,
and even ser up an email dare ro visir wirh someone Far away Many srudenrs have been
known ro “send" ro friends as close as rlie corripurer across ihe room, iusr fora run, alrernarive
form ordiscoiirse. webMail does nor have a comparable insranomcssage fearurc

Neverrlielcss, nor everyone is mourning me more Stalkingeconducive aspecrs ofDreams.
Alice McGary '99 won'r miss “spy," which will rcll anyone exacily whar coinpuier you are air.

Sonic laciilry members dislike rlie facr rhar anyone can see ifrhey are logged on and rlicn

 

conclude rhey are auromnricaiiy available iusr because rhey’re online.
