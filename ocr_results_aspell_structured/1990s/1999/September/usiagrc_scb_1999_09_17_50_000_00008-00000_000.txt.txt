loses

seoson Opener

By Chris Dietrich
Sporls Editor

When looking at crinnell's
win-loss record, the zero is in
the wrong column. The Pier
ncets fell last weekend in their
season opener at claremont
35—29, in a game in which nei—
that the offense not the defense
could wrap up the fourth quart
(61’.

The defense, with nine returning starters,
was expected to take the load offora young
offensive unit, but allowed two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter, as Claremont rallied
from a 29»Zl deﬁcit.

Josh Rehmann ’00 felt the defense could
have played much better. "Being thought of
as one of the best defenses in the conference,
if not the nation, I think we went into the
game oyerconndcnr," he said.

The Pioneers opened the scoring on a 40-
yard run byAlan Mourirsen '03, but the stags
answered with three touchdowns during the
next twenty minutes,

Grinnell did not score during this time pe.
riod, which to most was a surprise.

Quarterback Troy Dougherty ‘00 said, “We
can put up points like no other team, it’s a
matter of believing it."

The Pioneers showed they do have offen-
sive power with a spurt of22 straight points
to rake the lead into the fourth quarter,
Dougherty found Andy Egan ’01 with 3:57
left in the second quarter to close the gap and
Nate solmose ’oo booted a 27-yard field goal
to leave the halfrtime score at 21—16.

in the third quartet, Grinnell held the stags
scoreless and tallied' two to ucl'ldownss
Moutirsen scored on a two»yard run and Jeff
pedetson '02 caught a five—yard touchdown
pass from Doughetry with 1:12 left in the
period. Prospects ofa victory seemed excel»
lent with both the offense and defense firing,

And then came the ﬁreworks ofthc fourth.

This time, though, the Pioneers were on the
wrong side of Valley Forge, A momentum
shift occurred, leaving the Pioneers with their
ﬁrst loss since 1997,

clatemont scored the two necessary [ouzhr
downs for a victory and the pioneers could
not move the ball past halffield in their ﬁnal
drive.

“it was a matter of execution and mental
toughness, and thats where we failed in the
fourth quarter," said Doughetty.

Coach Greg Wallace commented, “We are
definitely disappointed with the loss. There
are very few reams thai can win a game with
an 0-5 turnover ratio. I was pleased with some
aspects ofout play. I really think we showed
great heart by eotning back from down 2177
to take the lead.”

This weekend, Grinnell will travel to Beloit
for their first conference game, and there
should be plenty ofthc right kind omtewotks
for the Pioneers.

seloit, which finished second in the league
last fall with a 572 record, defeated Concordia
20-15 lasrweck and returns a host ofstatters.

“There is no doubt we have a tough league
opener this week. Beloit is big and physical.
They are always wellwoachcd and play great
defense. We know that we have our hands
full,” said Wallace.

Should Grinnell expeCI any differenees this
week?

said Daugherty, “I expect to win. That's
the biggest difference,"

English Professor: Thanks Maggie, for
readingthar excuse for a poem out loud. Well
class, just to state, please note that this is an
absolutely terrible poem, 1 do not know why
Norton would include it in this anthology of
post—modernist poetry, so let‘s just make the
best of in Perhaps we should analyze it, to
practice the techniques we have learned. First,
regarding form.

student 1: Well, it starts out having a rhyme
scheme and in iambic pentametet, but to.
watds the end, it just gets kind ofjumbled. it
has no rhyme, no distinguishable meter and
very little merit in total for its formal capa.
bilities. it must be free verse,

Professor: That‘s greatl Now, what is the
message? Yes, in the front.

student 2: Sir, 1 actually wanted to talk
ahout some ofthe imagery. The guy that the

Professor: very good. Very, very good. Read
as much into this poem, and any others, that
you possibly can‘ Now, what messages can
you derive from this piece?

student 1: The poor is saying that it ishard
to beat the basketball team in flag football,
student 4: That's because they just lob it

up to that 68 guy everysinglc time. it must
destroy the fun ofthe game, for it to be that
easy.

Hochman: (just waking up) it's not that
easy being tall, Don't get mad at me. (back to
sleep)

Professor: But is that really the poinr> l
think the nett couple oflinss show that, al.
though the basketball team is dimeult to de.
feat, thctc is a more important point. What
is that>

student 2; You must be referring, sir, to
the camaraderie that the player feels, and how
mueh fun he is haying.

Professor; That's right! Now class, for next
wcek, please read at least three plays by
Shakespeare, preferably two comedies and one
tragedy.
