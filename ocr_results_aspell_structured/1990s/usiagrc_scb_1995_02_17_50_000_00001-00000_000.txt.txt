Pass/fail grading set to change

By TRISHA HOWELL

Staff Writer
RINNELL’S pass/fail option

for grading will be altered
beginnlnginthefallof1995.
The change. which will offer stu-
dents an SID/F option in place of
PIF, was approved during a De-
cember faculty meeting. The new
option will allow participating
students to receive an “S," den
noting “satisfactory." for work
completed at the A7 through 0
level; a “D." indicating D~level
work; or an “,"F indicating fail-
urc.
According to a faculty memo

from Helen Scott, associate dean of
the college, the decision to modify
theP/Fgradirlg system was madedue
to many faculty members feeling that
“the PIP option is sometimes used by
students who Wish to do the mini-
mum possible work for a course and
still ‘get by’ without GPA penalty."
Several faculty members have been
dissatisﬁed with a system awarding
students a “P" for D-level work.

In the new system, an “S"
grade will have no effect on a
student‘s cumulative grade point
average. A “D" grade will have a
value of 1.00, and an “F" grade
will contribute 0.00 to a student's

GPAt

Registrar Roger Lasley noted
that the original intent in offer-
ing the PIP option was to encourr
age students to take classes out-
side their major areas of study.

“The new system will still
allow students to take risks,"
Lasley said.

Scott noted that “it's important
for students to remember that this
will not change the applicability to
the majority of classes [taken
with alternative grading systems)"
Like P/F, classes taken S/D/F will
not be counted to fulﬁll major re-
quirements.

Paper prices are a cause for concern

Bookstore employees anticipate price increases for books and supplies

By RIVA SHARPLES
Editor in Chief

ITHlN the next three
weeks, student pock»
etbooks are going to

be feeling a little lighter 7 not
from entertainment or leisure
silpplies, but rather frotn essen-
tials of academic life like paper
and notebooks, according to
Cassie Anderson, business mane
ager or the Grinnell College
Bookstore.

In coming weeks, Anderson ex-
pects to see prices increase by more
than 70 percent for tiller paper. graph
paper. notebooks and tolders. The
increase is a result of conditions in
the printing and publishing industry
that have developed during the past
several years.

When the next shipment of
supplies hits Grinnell shelves.
consumers will be paying $2.99
for a pack of filler paper that
currently costs $1.79 per pack-
age. Graph filler,nowselling for
$135. will cost $2.19. Other

notebooks are expected to tile
crease from $1.99 to $3.19.

Officials at International Pa-
per, whicllsupplieslhc bookstore
with many paper products, cited
rising costs for labor and mater
rial (wood and recycling fiber)
as well as a “phenomenal in»
crease" in demand for paper in
the world market as reasons for
the price increases.

According to International
Pnper sales manager Randy Ausr
tin, an overwhelming worldWIde
demandhas forced prices forpulp
to skyrocket to more than $800
per ton. The demand for file
folders alone, Austin said, rose
more than seven percent in 1993
and anotiterninepercent in 1994.

Though the price jump is a
shock to everyone, Anderson said
she has been expecting it for scv»
eral yearst

“They've been warning us for
years about possible increases,"
she said.

“They say there’s a paper

shortage and that’s the reason.
But of course when I got the Isle
tei- about these increases I was
still really shocked and I thought
I had to get the word out."

Not only will the bookstore be
forced to inﬂate prices for notebooks,
graph and ﬁller paper. but textbook
manufacturers and makers of other
paper products like newspaper also
are expected to feel the increase in
papcrpricesand startbudgctrwatch-
ing,

In anticipation, the Des Mattias
Register already has started come
bining a few sections and cutting
down Circulation. Other businesses
such as Wal-Mart and similar dis-
count stores also will havcdttttculty
absorbingsuchasubstantialincrease.
Anderson predicted. Prices at the
Grinncll Bookstore won’t change
until the current supply is depleted.
she said.

“Now is the time to get paper
products." she added. “I just
wanted everyone to know about
the coming increase,”

Trustees discussed plans for
the college's sesquicentennial
celebration in 1996 and received
a progress report on the renovar
lions of Bowen Hall of Science
and the Fine Arts building. The
architect designing the Fine Arts
addition. Fred Clark of the Cesare
Pelli architectural firm, recently
was awarded an AIA Gold Medalt
The Gold Medals have been given
only 50 ritnes to outstanding
American architects.

Overall,Fergusonsaid,thewin»
ter meetings were very successful.
She noted that 20 of 25 trustees at
tended. which is a very good turnout
in light of the fact that the board
usualy has transportation and sched-
uling problems.

“We are lucky to have a dedir
cated board of trustees who really
care about the college and ask probe
ing questions.” Ferguson remarked.
