funeral in California. The three surdcnts
also worked with Bet Hannon, mmpus
chaplain, and Janet Kaufman, adviser I0
Chalutzim. “I think an important aspect

how they wanted the service, and that's
what we did." said Krohn.

With the remembrances, Jewish
Mourner’s Kaddish. the lighting of a
memorial candle, and a special song
were also part of the service. Kaddish
is a traditional prayer said with others
in order to keep mourners from being
alone, and likelhis service, bring them
into a caring community to celebrate
life. ”This service is not to make the
pain go away,“ said Bet Harmon in her
welcome, "because we know it never
will. However, we can share stories
with each other, and remember, and
know that her life made a difference."

On Tuesday, April 26, Fredrica
Matheweerreen, a former Pror
Choice activist, focused her address
on the woman’s relation to abortion,
believing there is littledisagreement
and therefore littleneed to argue that
the fetus is human life.

that ProrChoice is anti-baby and Pro-
Life is anti—woman. She suggested
that there is a severe disease behind

between mother and child. She is
often quoted for her saying, “no
woman wants an abortion like she
wants an ice cream cone."

Abortion, she said, benefits our
irresponsible society but is harmful
both physically and emotionally to
the actual women who get them.
Matheweerteen quoted from her
own study that the number one and
two reasons behind a woman having
an abonion are threats from: 1) her
boyfriend, and 2) her mother. She
suggested that abortion is not a real
choice but another societal way to
manipulate women.
