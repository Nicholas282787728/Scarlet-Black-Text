“Life in These British Isles”: an essay on life in the left lane

A reprint of an article that originally appeared in “Mind the Gap” , the oﬁ‘icial newsletter of the
Grinnell-in-London program; how to survive driving, shopping and paying for it all in pounds

AT’S it like to live in

England, you ask? Let’s

take an imaginary trip to
the supermarket and ﬁnd out.

First you leave your ﬂat (apart-
ment), lake the lift (elevator) to the
ground ﬂoor. and walk down thepttve
merit (sidewalk) to the carpark (park-
ing lot), where yourVauxhall Cavalier
isparked. Glancingamund thccarpark,
you notice many cars with familiar
names—Escorts. Chevettes. Tracers.
Civics, Metros, Fiestas, Grmaw
but none or" the cars you see look
familiar. Not too many minivans here,
and no big cars like Cadillacs, prob
ably duetothehigh costofpeuol(gas),
which right now is around 55p (short

pence."orpennies)perlitre(which
is about $87 per litrekl let you sci-
ence majors ﬁgure out how much that
is per gallon).

You turn off the security system
(seems every car has one). take your
car stereo from the boot (trunk), unv
lock the door and climb into your car
(on the right side, of course). After
shoving the stereo into the hole in the
dashboard. you grip the stickshift
ﬁrmly in your left hand (most cars are
manual shilling). start the car. and off
you go.

Getting there

FirsLyouneedtolocalethespeed
limit signs. Actually, are you on the
left side of the road"! Musm't forget
that Now forthosespeed limitsigns—
they‘re the round ones. with a red
border, and only a number in the
middle. Fortunately, they’re in miles—
per-hour. Can‘t fuid a street sign? If
you‘re in London. look on the sides of
each building at the comer of a city
block. You of course have your Lon-
don A to Z (detailed street map with
hundreds of pages) open beside you.
sof'mding yoursupermarketshouldn‘t
be hard to do.

You need to watch out for buses
and taxis here. They seem to own the
road. and no one seems to argue with
them. Let that bus pull out in front of
you, now. Look out {or zebras, too.
They’re all over the place in London,
Thankfully forthepedestrians. Zcbias
(actually, Zebra—crossings, names for
the stripes in the street. I suppose) are
pronounced with a short “e" sound,
and are places where pedestrians have
the rightof way In cross asueet Trafr
fie, no matter how busy, is supposed to
come to a stop, with no lightor sign to
warn the driver, when someone is
waiting to cross.

Otherthanaebras, taxis and buses,
you'll need ID keep on the lookout for
roundabouts. These are the English
equivalent of our intersections. You
never know when you’ll meet up with
one, but you need to be careful when
you do. The best way I can think to
describe one is to have you picture a
circle in your mind. with thrceor more
legs sticking out from it. Each leg is a
street or road, and there is usually a
nice diagram of the roundabout on a
signjust before you arrive, ifyou httpr
pen to see it. [saw one roundabout in
central Englandwtthnineroads branchr
ing offlromiL Don'twon'y, though.
If you miss your road the ﬁrst time
around. you can continue until you
come back around and get off the
second, or third time. They're great
fun towatch in action,notso much fun
to navigate in. Basically, you pull up
to the roundabout and stop (you just
have to remember that part. because
thereareno stop signs). You look right
(trafﬁc flows clockwise), and if there
is no one coming (drivers already on
the roundabout have the rightof way),
you enter the circle. Remember to put
on your right ﬂasher (blinker) all the
time you are going around. until you
see your street. Then you put on your
left ﬂasher, and pull off. Unless you
unfortunately happentobeonamund-
aboutthathas two lanes and you’re on
the inside lane. Then I guess you slip
into the outside lane as soon as pos-
sible and vow neverto go inside again.
Highway driving

Well, you‘vemade itoutofdown-
town London, and are now merging
ontotheMl Motorway (six-lanehigh-
way). of the three lanes going your
way, which is the slow lane? The left,
of course. You get your car up to
cniising speed (about 70 mph), when
you notice a slowpoke in the center
lane, doing about 50 in his Jaguar X16
Model 90 (lags and BMW’s and
Mercedes are everywhere). Don‘t
cruise past him on the left. or you may
be picked up forreckless driving. You
have to pull over two lanes. to the far
right lane. pass him on his right, then
(ifyou‘re not conﬁdent enough to stay
in the fast lane) drift back over to the
slow side. If you decide to ride in the
middle lane, be sure to stay out of the
way of the lorries (tractor trailers),
because they‘re not allowed to use the
far right lane to pass. and the lon'y
drivers don't take too kindly to being
held up.

There’s the sign for the exit you
need. with the diagram of the round
about. You need to get off at the third
road as you go around. Not bad, {or a
ﬁrst try. Driving those roundabouts is

enough to make you have to visit the
loo(bathroom). Here' 5 lhestorc you’re
looking for, and new minute too soon.
Thecarparkis not too iull,bui lookout
for handicap parking spaces and the
spaces designated for mothers with
babies (no kidding).
Shopping for crisps

The store itself looks familiar
enough, shopping trolleys (carts) scat—
tercd around the lot. Don‘t waste time
at the newsstand on the way in, there
are plenty of those closer to home.
Inside, you’ll have to get accustomed
to measuring things in kilograms and
litres. ‘t‘hcbestidcaisjusttolookatthe
size of the container and say, “Does
that look like enough?“ You’ll also
have to getused tohigh prices. Where
I shop, bananas are 50p (about 8.80) a
pound. and milk is 83p (aboutSl.30)
for 2 quarts. and you can't get a con
tainer larger than that. Looking for
cookies? Ask for the biscuit aisle.
Hungry for hamburgers? Buy acouple
pounds of mince. Making Christmas
hiscuits,andneed shortening? [haven‘t
found it yet myself, but I think I’m
supposedtobelooking [or lard. Gonna
sprinkle your biscuits with powdered
sugar'.7 Here it‘s Caslol’ sugar. Don’t
forget to pick up some chips (french

fries) to go with your burgers, and
maybe somecrisps (potato chips) fora
snack later on. Need drinks, of course.
If you‘re a Snapple-lover, never fear,
it’s here. How about some Mountain
Dew? Won'tﬁnd it. OK, maybe root
beer? Nope. You’ll have to settle {or
Coke. Pepsi or 7up if you shop where
1 do. Two litres, 99p ($1.57). You
could try the Sainsbury (Hchc) ver-
sion of Coke for about half the price,
lmportrtlstuffscemstobevcry highi
a box ofOId El Paso taco shells (12 in
a box) will set you back about $2.20.
All right, let‘s eatchcaply then. A box
of inslant macaroni and cheese—$.33
at l-lche. right? Try 89p, or about
81.40. Let’s put it this way: lbought
what I hopewill be a week‘s groceries
for two adults and two children today,
the equivalent of three paper grocery
sacks full.and speanell.over$65.00.
This ain’t no Bloomies
Maybe you’ve been needing a
new pair of trousers (pants)—don‘t
worry. lotsof grocery stores havecloth-
ing sections. Sainsbury‘s, where I
shop, has two entire aisles that make
you feel like you're in WalMart.
Time to go through the checkout.

waiting either. And no candy displays
to tempt you. Be sure to unload your
cart onto the moving belt as soon as
you can. And while the cashier’s
ringing things up, get busy sacking
your own stuff.
