ORK, deadlines and of-
ﬁce politics in the “real
world"arealotdifferent

than those at Grinnell College; at
least that is what 17 Grinnellians are
discovering this semester through the
college internship program.

The students venture off campus
tospendtwo fulldayseach woekinthe
work force. They inlem for a wide
range of businesses and organimtions
located in Des Moines, Iowa City,
Marshalllown and Grinnell. They do
a vast array of work, from gathering
research at a university level to work-
ing witll children or victims ofdomes~
tic abuse to reporting news {or local
newspapers or television stations.

Each academic year, as many as
70 Grinnell students panicipate in
the internship program. They spend
approximately 14 hours at the site
plus driving time each week in ex»
change forfourhoursofcollegectedit.
They must also meet frequently with
a faculty sponsor and the Career De-
velopment Ofﬁce, keep a journal of
their activities at the internship and
produce a ﬁnal paper or project

Many of them participate in the
program to test out possible careers,
gain experience and link their aca—
demic laming to the “real world,”
according to CDO Director Steve
Langarud, whoorganizes the program

and meets with students each yearr

“What I hear ﬁrorn students is
that the internship helps them tie the
academic world to their career explo»
ration,“ he said. “And thebest way to
ﬁnd outif you like acareer is to do it."

lunior Alexandra Ravitz. who is
intenling at the Slate Archaeologist
Society in Iowa City this semester,
thinks that her internship will help
her decide if she wants “archaeology
as a degree or not," she said.

“I really like the intemship be-
cause it gives me a chance to see a part
of archaeology thathould neverhave
been exposed to omerwise,“ she said.
"Paleoethnobotany isn’t usually cov-
ered in your everyday anthro class."

Senior Laura Oelberg, who
works at the Iowa Department of
Public Health in Des Moines in the
environmental health bureau, decided
to do an internship this semester be
cause she doesn’tknow what she will
be doing after graduation and wants
to explore her options, she said

“I thought it would be a good
opportunity toseeif this is something
I am interested in," she said. “If not,
it’sbeuerlo ﬁnd outnow thanseveral
years down the road. I've also found
it's a really good way to make con-
tactsand explore differentresources.”

Participating in an internship has
many beneﬁts,accordingmlangemd.
Students not only gain valuable expe-
rience and a chance to check out a
possible career path, but are provided

with a good resume builder.
“[Employers] like to see intern-
shipexpetience on resumes," he said.
“I think a lot of people make a big
mistake and think, ‘I have to get paid
for an employer to value my experi-
ence,‘ but that‘s not true. They don’t
sit down and ask you if you were
paid. They ask you what you did"

workplace, Langenld said.

"Across the board, employers
value critical thinking, good work
skillsand good verbal skills and hard
work,” he said. “Those are things
that Grinnellians are taught to do.
They are also valued because of the
quantity of work they are able to do.
Grinnellians
get better
projects and
ultimately bet-
ter experience
[than other in-
tems]."

“While doing this. I am also ar-

tive collection that will be used in tlle
ofﬁce ill the future," she said

But while there are many posi-
tive beneﬁts to participating in the
internship program, Langerud was
quick to point
out that it is a
serious time
commitment.

“I want
peopletounder—
stand that it is a
very big time
commitment,"
Langerud said.
“B “I we ‘ VB
never had any-
one come into

say that they

That’s because

ultysponsorand
they really understand the time com-
mitment involved.“

Students interested in doing an
intemshlp next year should contact
the Career Development Office.

“lntemships are a really impor-
tant pan of a Grinnell education,“
Langerud said. “Everyone can ben-
eﬁt from the program."
