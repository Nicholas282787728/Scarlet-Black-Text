By FREDRICK MANN

Assistant News Editor

ESTERDAY evening,
Assistant Director of Ad
missionsRichardPittintro—

duced to students a new advisory
council that will be coordinated and
funded through the Office of EnrollA
ment The name ofihe committee is
the Student Advisory Committee on
Multicultural Admission.

Pitt created SACOMA because
he noticed that there were justa few
students of color involved with Adv
missions.

“SACOMA will give us a stu-
dents’perspectiveofhow the Admis—
sions Office is handling its mission
:to create a multicultural residential
community of learning," said Pitt.

However, Pitt also emphasized
that diversity is essential and that

anyone is welcome Iojoint

“We would like SACOMA to
represent the spectrum of students
experiences at Grinnell." said Pitt.

The members of the group will
meet a leastoncea month and discuss
upcoming events.

Members will alsohostprospec»
tive students, assist with Phonathon.
accompany Admissions representa-
tives on highvschool visits and criA
tique Admission’s publications.

AssistantDeanforMulticultural
Affairs Siclinda Canty-Elliot bee
lieves, “This initiative is very good
and I think Grinnell is making more
progress toward diversity."

Ironically, the forming of this
committee is timely because “Over
five thousand students of color have
contacted Admissions [or informa-
tion this year,” said Pitt.
