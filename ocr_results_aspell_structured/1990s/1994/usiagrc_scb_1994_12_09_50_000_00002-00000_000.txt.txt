are a part of this fourestar meal.

Again. we refuse to rate
Tuesday’s dinner, the infamous ﬁsh
platter with scallops and pork roast
with gravy. In case you've forgotten,
we have targeted this meal {or re-
placement with chicken patty
pannesan, led likes the soybean and
cheese stuffed peppers but Jon, Matt
and Jason think he‘s nuts. He gives it
three stars, the others give him a good
blow to the jaw.

Theonly otheritems worth men-
tioning this week are the crinkle cut
fries on Tuesday and the chopped
chicken on Thursday.

Beforerevlewingtheblandhigh-
lights oflhis week, we would like to
point out the bland items that are
always available in the dining halls.
Theseinclude saltines,toast,bananas.
tea and the occasional rice that is
served on the salad bar. Matt drew
the short straw and has proven that
one can subsist for several weeks on
these items alone. Thanks for taking
one for the team, Matt,

Tonlght’s dinner has two tasty
bland vegetables. redskin potatoes
andcauliﬂoweras longas you forego
the cheese sauce. Saturday. the only
bland item is served at dinner but
you’ll have to work for it, The
chuckwagon corn contains red pep-
pers which need to be picked out.

Sunday’s dinner is the five—star
bland meal of the week! You can eat
without being ostracized by your
friends. Unless you’re on a liquid
diet, you can have spaghetti without
the sauce. crinkle cut carrots and a
few hard rolls. Eat up. though, be-
cause the only thing you can eat on
Monday is the wheat dinner rolls.

By the way, kudos to dining ser-
vices for replacing the canned meat

sauce With one that has a more aue
thentic taste.

Tuesday,youcan catasprouting
pita without the sprouts and cheese
for lunch but remember to stay the
hell away from Cowles and Quad at
dinner. Ifyou get desperate, you can
go to dinner and eat the whipped
potatoes and rye bread.

For God's sake, avoid the brace
coli cheese soup at Wednesday's
lunch tfyou have the nu. As a pre
cautionary measure. we'll have to
physically resrrniit Jed. For dinner,
depending on how sensitive you are
to grease, you can try the wide egg
noodles. Otherwise, you‘re stuck
with biscuits.

Thursday, skip lunch and eat a
bigburgerbunor somecornbread for
dinner, Friday is your last dining
services meal before the trip home so
you want to be extra careful. For
lunch, the vegetarian vegetable soup
broth is asai’e betand fordmner stick
With the brcndslicks.

Remember, the Flu only lasts 7-
10 days so when you go home. you
can glve it to your friends and family
and watch llictn suffer.

Nowforlhc big news. Since this
is the last article of the semester. we
would like to announce an event that
could change thiscampusas we know
it, Ifyou thinkyou can cook, let us be
the judge! We will be holding a
contest in which we will review the
cooking prowess of a different per
son each week.

All you have to do to enter is e»

cial! Prizes range from a date with

nary mystery gifts.

No condom? Nogchance.

ll someone asks you to risk your [dc to! sex, ask yourseli. .is
that person worth it? Is anyone worth it? Abstinence IS the
only sure way to avord AIDS and other diseases, but if you

Editor seeks help ﬁnding lost marbles

By TIM CORKERY
Copy Editor

Y older brother was an
undergraduate at UT7
Austin when I was still

in high school. I remember him
telling me that the graduate library
downtown was open until one in the
morning. and I didn’t believe him.
How could any place be open that
late" Who could possibly study
then?

LastMonday night, around 1:30
1 finally ullderstood, as l silently
reassured myself that I had time.
YMCAwasopen until four. Ididn‘t
stay there that long, thankfully, but
my brain was pretty fried anyway. I
had been finishing up a paper that
shouldhavetnkcnmconlypartol'an
afternoon, but had instead plagued
me for most oftwo days Finally, at

 

about two o'clock in the morning, I
typed my conclusion and printed
out thepaper. Iwas frazzled, breath-
ing irregularly in short gasps, blinke
mg rapidly, my tongue lolling stu-
pidly out ol'lhc srdc ofmy mouth. I
took my paper to the stapler, hoping
to God there were staples or I‘d take
snmoonc's life. I picked up the
stapler, and just below I could do
the deed, i noticed a piece of paper
under the stapler. A single, white
sheet orpaper with writing on it. In
very large lcllcrs it said, “YOUR
BUTT SWELLS WHEN YOU LIE,
BITCH," It was so random that all
I could do was laugh. I laughed
long, and I laughed hard. I was
laughing so hard that I couldn't tell
people why l was laughing, From
liehind me, I heard, “Oh, good.
Tim’s fillallycrcickcd." I \vcnthome
then. It was snowing.
