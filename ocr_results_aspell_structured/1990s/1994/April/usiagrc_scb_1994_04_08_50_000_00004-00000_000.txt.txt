Letters of intent for SGA elections

 

 

My name is Aaron Fate and
I’m mnning for SGA President, I
am currently a sophomore trying to
choose between possible majors in
History,Mltsic,PhilosophyandPor
litical Science (since they’re all
pretty well unmarketable, I ﬁgure,
what’s the difference). My extra-
curricular interests include Ilre Grin-
nell Singers, the Debating Union, a
KDIC program (a classical music
show from 10:00 pm till 12:00
am. on Sundays, ifanyone‘s inter-
ested), Kung Fu, and SGA, where
I’ve been the Hall Senator from
Smith for a few terms.

ldecided to run, well. I don't
know why exactly. It’sjust, having
served in SGA fora little more than
a year, I‘ ve been slowly accumulat-
ing a laundry list of concerns and
ideas.

My first concern is Tom
Crady's proposal for a hired came
pus security force (read: rent-a-cop)
to be implemented in a year or two.
While campus security is a serious
issue, I think that an outside secu-
rity force, in addition to being highly
costly, would deal only very clum-
sily with those security issues of
most concern to students, such as
personal assault. The increased
lighting, escort service, and pro-
grams in self-defense seem to me to
address the problem of personal
security much more directly. In
addition, one wonders to what ex»
tent the security force would act to
control student behavior. In short,
I’m concerned that some of the
unique openness and freedom of
Grinnell's campus would be lost if

a couple of mall cops were hired by
the administration in the name of
our safety.

A second proposal that I would
like to deal with concerns the
President’ska Force on Smoking.
First, I think that it would be totally
impractical and undesirable to com
vertGrinnell toanon—smoking cam-
pus. Nonetheless, I do believe that
there is enough student interest to
establish one or two additional non-
smoking halls. Currently, students
whomightprefernon-smoking hous-
ing often cannot live there because
of limited space (priority is given to
thosestudents with amedical reason
such as allergies or asthma), The
most recent housing poll shows that
15% of students on campus smoke,
and while this ﬁgure may be a con
servativeestimate,Ithinkthatalolal
ofthreenon-smoking donnsoncam-
pus would not severely limit hous»
ing options for smokers, and might
help to undercut later attempts to
impose an even more restrictive,
campus wide smoking policy.

Third, I feel that it's highly imr
porrant to create channels through
which the student body and SGA
can influence administrative policy.
As a ﬁrst step in this direction, I
would like to give the SGA cabinet
power to call a meeting with the
Executive Council (composed of
President Ferguson, Dean Duke, the
Faculty Chair, and the academic
Division Chairs) when particularly
diverse issues arise.

Other ideas and proposals in~
clude: upgrading or replacing the
I-larrisCenterFilm Projectorthrough

some kind of matching funds pro-
gram betwccn SGA and tile col-
lege;an SGA column in the 5&8 so
thatthosclivinginOCNCO Houses
or whose Senatorial Minutes are
sporadic get at least some sense of
the issues before SGA; working
with the Vlcchl’Csidenl on
cirriculum issues such as indicat-
ing labcourses on transcripts, mov»
ing the pass/fail deadline till later
in the semester, and maintaining
LheroleoiStudentSEPC'sinevalu-
ating professors; establishing a
quasi-curricular film-making
course in conjunction with the The
atre and Arts Departments; chang-
ing the Thursday and Friday before
ﬁnal exams into buffer days; gctr
tingphysicaltrainers forclubspons;
reviving and updating the SGA
Bulletin Board, as well as setting
up some kind of weekly or bi»
weekly vax poll to receive student
feedback;plus,installationofHBO,
Cinemax, and Showtime . . . well,
maybe.

Lastly,Iamopentoanyandall
suggestions or comments from the
student body. Most of the propos-
als mentioned came from discus-
sions I‘ve had with friends around
campus, and 1 think that there‘s no
better source of ideas. I would
encourageanyone whocantocome
to the debate scheduled on April
10th, and please let me know ifyou
have any questions, comments or
concerns. My vax accountis [Fate]

Menezes

Hi, my narneis Francis Menezes
and I am a member of the class of
1995. I wish to serve as Vice~Presi»
dent for the academic year 94-95
Why have] decided to run for Vice4
President? Good question. It's be-
cause I’ve spoken with several
people, all of whom have concerns
about things that are happening on
campus. I wish to represent the
student body and their concems in
the coming year. I am qualified. I
asked PresidentChad Fink to inves-
LigetegeuingaphotocopierforNorth
Campus. This coming fall, the Har-
ris center will be equipped with a
photocopier. As you can see, I get
results.

 

In looking at what has gone on
during the year, I ﬁnd some things
that I would like to see changed.
Presently there is talk about labs be-
ing put on transcripts. If this passes,
as it currently stands, it will begin
wilhtheclassof1998. Iwouldliketo
see it become active with the class of
1995, and I‘d like to see it become
retroactive to cover all the classes
with labs taken by students during
their time at Grinnell,

The smoking policy is another
issue that needs further examination.
Currently, Smith is the only non»
smoking dorm, with the basements
of Read and Haines also being non»
smoking, Iwouldlikemoredorms to

be non-smoking, on both North and
South campus. Furthermore, there
needs to be a change in the policy
about getting into dorms/ﬂoors that
are designated as nonsmoking.

There needs to be more lights
on and off campus. New lights are
to be installed. However, these will
not be sufﬁcient. It is very impor
tant for all of us to be safe on our
campus.

Lastly,l hoperhatifl amelmted
Vice-President, all of you will feel
comfortable coming to me with any
comments. I look forward to meet-
ing you soon. Vote for me Francis
Menezes,comcelection day. Thank
you.

This is my second semester as the
Younker senator, and I am the senate

which mediates senator and presidan

Younker residents at SGA meetings

have enjoyed being pan of these com-
mittees because it demonstrates
Grinnell’s selfrgovemance policy, and

presidcntchairs tltc SCC, and appoints
the other student members of the CC.
Thcscarc imponantrcsponsibititiesbe-
cause decisions oonceming our cur-

and they are even more important this

Even though all the members of the
SCC and students have repeatedly and
strongly given negative reactions to the
proposed change, our voice is not at-
fecting their proposal. Ido believe that
the SEPC faculty evaluation process
shouldbeclarifled andchangod, but the

mmoe has proposed is unmptable. .
There is no student input in the pro
posal, and it mkes away the job the
SEPC'S were designed to do. I also
believcthatthe ncwproposals wouldbc
ineffective. How many students would
sit down and type out responses to a
