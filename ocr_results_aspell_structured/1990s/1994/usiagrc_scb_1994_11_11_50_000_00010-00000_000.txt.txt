LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

Case For Gun Control

page ofThursdziy’s Des Moines

Register. you find a large Reade
linc reading, “GOP victors map
agenda.“ The Republicans gained
conLrol of both houses of Congress
in Tuesday’s clcclion, taking con-
Lrol 0(49 scars in the House of chr
rescniaiivcs and nine seals in the
Senate. The GOP also got ten new
governors elected.

In Iowa, ihoSlaleHouscochp-
resentziiives is now dominated by
Lhc Republican Pariy. which con-
Lrols 64 of [he 100 seats. Governor
Terry Bransiad also won his fourth
term as Governor. largely on prom-
ises of ii dcalh pcnalty and lower
taxes.

One issue that is mosiprobably
not going to be on the agenda for the

IF you take a look at the from

- ncw Republican government is gun

COanl. The vast majority of the
GOP is adamantly anti-gun conLrul,
and the National Rifle Associau'on
aligns itself mainly with Republi-
cans.

Considering Lhal the number of
guns in the United States will most
probably continue L0 rise during the
next two years of Republican rule,
you may ﬁnd the slory on page three
of the Register ironic. and probably
a bit sickening.

The story concerns Matilda
Crabucc, a founeen year-old Loui-
siana girl who was shol to death by
her father. Robeni She had been
hiding in a closet. waiting for her
parents to return home so Lhaz she
could jump out and scare them

She scared her father intoshool-
ing her in the neck with a .357-
calibcrpislol. Shcdied twelve hours
lateri

Michael Worlcy of the local
Sheriff's Ofﬁce said, ”in you can’t
blame people [or wanting w defend
themselvesmwhat‘shappeninghere
is happeningeverywherein lhecoun—
”yin

Chances are good that Robert
Craercc, like mosl handgun own~
ers, will never have 10 "defend him-
self." He was worried, like many of
the residents of West Monroe, about
a recent rash of burglaries that had
been sweeping the town. Most burr
glars are not out to harm the people
they are stealing from. Inslcad. they
try to strike homes where they are
likely not to encounter any resis-
tance. The only things Robert
Crabuccprobably had lo worry about
were his possessions. The person
who needed protection in Ihis case

was his daughter.

Protection for the more than
10,000 yearly gun death victims in
the United States is not likely to
come while the Republicans comm]
ourgovcmmcnl. Isthemcssage ihat
the people of the United States
wanted to send to our govemmcnt
Tuesday “we want more lragic
shootings?" I hope nol.

Song Correclion

l-EE INXS song that played at.
I the Clinton victory rally last
Thursday was “New Sensor
lion," rather than “Devil inside.”
which is whnl was rcporled in the
November 4Ih front-page slory by
Riva Sharples. Despite the fact that
the ’94 clocLions will be over by the
limo the Grinncll community as a
whole has the chance to read ihis
letter, I hope Lhal you will prim ii,
becauseiliskcyinasmallyeiimpor»
lam way to the ’96 elections.

Bill Clinion playing “Devil In»
side” at his own victory rally would
seem quite bimrrc for the circum
stances, wouldn't it? Therefore, I
simply want to reiterate that the song
was “New Sensation," a much more
promising. lively and happy theme.
Thanks.
