Students protest to keep professor Powers

ByJonathanCook

AST month a group of 15 stu—
dents mettodiscuss thcpossibilr
ity of a permanent position for

John Powers, who has Worked for the
Religious Studies department as a loc—
lurcr for the last two years.

Originally, Powers was hired as a
temporary replacement for Harold
Kasimow, who went on leaveduring the
‘92»‘93academic year. Attheendof that
time, Powers’ contract was extended for
another year when Janine Sawada unch
peeledly requested a lave of absence.
However, if all gocsas planned. Powers
willbe leaving Giinnell attlieend of this
semester to make room for Sawada's
return.

The group of suidarits that began
mceung inlanuary hopestochangc that.
It is their plan topressure thezidminisna»
tion into creating a pennaneni position
for someone with John Powers’ spe-
cially, South Asian religion.

“Ourprincipal goal isthecrcation of
an extra position, but I think a lot of
smdcntswould liketoweJohn Powersin
lhatrxrsnion,"saidGarethFishcr,a leader
of the student organization. “There's no

question that he as an individual has
provided the impetus foraction tocrmtc
a new position.”

Citing problems such as overcnr
rollment in Major Eastern Religions, the
low number of upper level courses in
Asian religion, and the general lack of
cultuial diversity within the Religious
Studies cumculum, thegroup has senta
formal letter to the departmental faculty
requesting assistance in their eﬁorts.

Although this letter requested “an
oven endorsement of our request to the
administmn'on," the response of faculty
members has men cautious. “We have
an established way for discussing and
evaluating the curriculum and faculty
positionsand tliatis for tliedepamncnuo
be in communication with the SEPC,"
explained Howard Burlde, a professor
with the depanment

Though Bln‘ldeeiicouragcd thestir
dcnistostay involvedhecxpressod mixed
feelings about die methods they might
useto achieve their goals. “I am uneasy
about politicizing the choice of our face
ulty," he explained.

Powers recognized the difficulty of
the students’ task but expressed his do
sire to remain in Grinnell as long as
possible, "I really don’t expect that it’s

 

“1010-

Professor John Powers
going to happen. I think it would be nice
if it were to happen though because I do
like Grinncll and I like the mople here."

Powers stressed that he has played

him at Grinnoll. However, he agreed
with the students in their belief that his
classes fill an imponant niche in the
college's curriculum. “1 think that there

 

 

 

really' is a gap in South Asian Studies
here. Considering what a large area of
the world it is and that it contains over a
quancr of the wrxid‘s population, we
ougit ID be offering something."
