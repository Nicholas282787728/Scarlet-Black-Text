DISHES from page 5

Quad, however, dish breakers are
expected to clean up the mess them-
selves. If you breakadish at Cowl“,
Stewart says,just tell Lhe
salad bar or beverage
person so he or she can
take care of the mess.
At Quad, one should tell
a staifperson so he or
she can get the broom
for you.

”Don't be shy!"
Gulick says. “Come and
ask {or that Ihing! We
all clean up ourown little
messes. I‘m proud to say that there
are some kids who’ve been here four
years and have never broken a dish.”
She knocks on wood.

Bothdininghallsrecyclediebro-
ken glass, Gulick says it’s imponani
not In ptit glass in a garbage bag

because the glass can
slice Lhe bag and cut the
person who has to take
out the trash.

Although the num
ber of dishes broken Lhis
year in Quad is larger
than last year’s,
McConnell's records
don‘t show a yeanry
year increase in the num-
ber of dishes needing re-

placement. For example. in 199091
and in 199192, 756 glasses were
purchaced. In 1992-93, dining ser-
vices only bought 324.
