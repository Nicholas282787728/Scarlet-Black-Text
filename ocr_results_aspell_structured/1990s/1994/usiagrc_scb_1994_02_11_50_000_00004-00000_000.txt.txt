ful as he would have liked, the ale
bum didn‘t rescue him from eco-
nomic pressures, and Lonnie was
forced to play all sorts of music at
any gig he could get.

Butin 1975,he was asked tojoin
a“bluescaravan"touringandrt‘cord—
ing in France. The success of this
venture helped Lonnie to put together
his own band and venture out on the
road. After his live performances
began to earn him more and more
respect. Lonnieeventually signed on

with Alligator Records and has since
produced six solo recordings with
them, the most recent being Satisfao
lion Guaranteed (199]). This latest
recordingcontainsLonnie’sbeloved
rock ‘n’ blues, his worldrrenowned
style,withsixoriginalsongs,ranging
from fast rockers to late night blues.

For The Practicing Musician put it:
“He jumps from funky soul to un-

blues with bayou stank to work
crowds into a steaming frenzy of
repentant ecstasy."
