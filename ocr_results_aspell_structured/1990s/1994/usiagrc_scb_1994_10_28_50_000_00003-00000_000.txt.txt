GORP Director publishes book on canoeing in North America

By ANDREW HICKEN
Staff Writer

RINNELLRecreational Ser-
vices Director David Zeiss'
new book capitalizes on a
life-long love of the outdoors. It is
entitled Canoeirtg
North America: A
Guide 10 Wilderness
C anoeirtg.
The book in»
cludes directions for
trips in the United
States and Canada,
including exhibitions
down the Rio
Grande and on the
CoppermineRiverin
Canada’s Nonhwest
Territories. Each
trip’s entry includes
information such as
the trip length and thedegree ofexpe
rience required to handle the river.
The book also includes sections
on canoeing basics, such as strokes,
common equipment and how to use
maps and compasses Zeiss says this
makes the book useful forcanoers of
levels of experience that run “across
the board“,

The book, he said, is designed to
work for people who perhaps have
only gone on a few day trips, and
would like to try a week-long excur»
sion.

According to Zeiss, his interest
in canoeing first developed at a sum-

mer camp he attended when he was
“very young,” Since then, he has
gone on many of the trips he outlines
in his new work

In addition, his role as Recre-
ational Services Director for GORP
sometimes means that he directly
leads canoe m'ps.

Canoeing North America was

three years in the making. Zeiss says
hismainchallengeinwritirtgthebook
was dealing with all of the different
administrative agenci$ that oversee
the rivers, like the Bureau of 12nd
Management, the Office of Wild and
Scenic Rivers, and Minnesota’s De-
partment of Natural Re-
sources. Eachagencyhas
differentpmuliaritiesand
idiosyncrasies in how it
allows its rivers to be
used, he said, and the
book conveys this infor-
mation to the reader.
Zeiss has been at
Grinnell since 1987i He
has a bachelor’s degree
from Lawrence Univer-
sity and a master‘s de-
gree from the University
of Iowa. For his next
project, he is considering
a book on trips in Wisconsin and
Minnesota.
