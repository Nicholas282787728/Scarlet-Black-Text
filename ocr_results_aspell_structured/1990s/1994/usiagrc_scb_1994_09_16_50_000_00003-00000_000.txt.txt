Grinnell Police Department

currently. according to Officer Steve

Kricgcl who handles Ihefts reported

by students. Since August t,twcnty
bikes have been reported stolen.

Last Saturday, Arica Olson's
bicycle was stolen.

“I know I locked it," She said. “I
kept searching allover. I was upset
because I relied on my bike.”

Theday beforeOlson’s bike was
taken, Wyman Taylor and Ken Lidie
found their bikes were also missing.
Taylor’shlcyclecostSZSOand Lidia’s
was a mountain bike worth $800,

“I stopped, looked around, and
found my lock was on the ground and
my bike was gone,” said Lidie.

Kriegel said that a large conccnr
iration of bikes are stolen from the
college each year.

“[Collcge students] have more
expensive bikes 7 some bikes are
worth three to four hundred dollars."

Krigel said it’s possible thatbike
thieves in Grinnell are organized and
stealing bikes is their business.

“We have a lead right now [on
the bike thefts], and we will be look
ing into this issue," he said.

Meanwhile, while the police
search for leads, ViCLllTlS ofbike theft
are concerned.

“Iwantlo know whatlhccollege
is doing,” said Olson. “It seems like
it‘s accepted that bikes are stolen."

Associate Director of Facilities
Management Michael Burt said that
the college is trying to combat bi—

with more secure kinds that allow
students to attach U—locks to the bike
frame and the rack.

“We ordered a couple of dozen
new bike racks recently," he Said.
“They cost about $90 a piece. They

are the green racks.”

OfﬁcerKriegalsaidthatstudents
should write down their bicyclc’s
serial number so that if the bike is
stolen, it can be identified. Students
should also be aware, he said, that
most bikes are stolen during break
times, and therefore bicycles should
be placed in secure rooms.

Student Kevin Curtis, an avid
cyclist who has never had his bicycle
taken, said, “Lockyourbikeup. Use
U—locks and lock it correctly.”

In addition, the publications ofr

decentralization of the staff, while

“Unlike previous regimes, I to—

WhileZlabingerispositive about

also burned out and worn down.

getmore voters to supportour Demor
cratic candidates in the November
election."

IowaDemocratic Chairman Eric
Tabor said the effort by Poweshiek
County Democrats and Grinnell Cole
lege Democrats is part. of an aggres-
sive statewide voter registration on
Saturday.

“The1994 campaign is an excit-

out of you,“ he said. “There is no
destiny in the paper.”

Zlabinger blames much on the
high turnover rate of the newspaper.

“Students are only here for four
years and for a newspaper that is art
extremely high turnover," he said.
“Coupled with thefactthatthis school
has no journalism department and
that there is no faculty adviser for the
paper, there is just no continuity in
the newspaper."

Zlabinger feels that he gave the
paper his “all,” 7 to the point where
his intended graduation in 1995 was
at stake. The lessons he learned dur-
ing his reign are invaluable, he says,

"Thenewspaper should printthe
truth and nothing but the truth,“ he
said. “It should be a means of docu—
menting the times akind ofinstant

are too focused on the bubble I
think empowerment goes to peoples’
heads and it creates humongous
egos." .

cause he does not believe that theft is
a serious problem at Grinnell.

”I am lessconcemed aboutbikes
being stolen [at Grinnell] because
your bike can be stolen anywhere."

Many students, like senior Liv
Thorstensson discovered that her
8600 bike had been stolen after for-
getting to use their lock.

But bicycle theft has not always
been a problem at Grinnell.

“Through the I920’s,sponswere
very important," noted college Arr

poltticalissueshavebeen documented
more fully. I believe the shift in what
the paper emphasizes reﬂects what
studean are thinking."

Kintner is currently working on
compilinganindexofall the issuesof
the S &B from 1975 to present. It is
a solo project.

“I work on it at odd hours when
I have a chance,“ she said. There
already exists an index for the issues
from 1894-1975.

The S & B was preceded by a
publication called the News Letter.
According to Al Jones, retired Pro»
fessor of History, the News Letter
was constantly being investigated for
use of inappropriate language and
thinlyaveiled insults to faculty, apat-
tern that developed again in the late
1960‘s, This is perhaps the 5628‘s
most notorious era.

rake bikes for a joy ride and leave it
on the other side of campus." said
senior Christy Johnson. For many
years, bike borrowing was an unofﬁ~
cial tradition at Grinnell,

“The campus actually had extra
bikes for students to borrow," said
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and Director of Housing Oda
Callison.

However, in the past few years,
more and more students have be»
come the victims of bike theft. And
so, many Grinnellians have aban-
doned the tradition of bike borrowing
and are locking up their bikes.

an anti-Vietnam War piece and an
exposes on nuclear testing, accord

“The printer over in Newton
eventually refused to print the 8&8
due to its use of four-letter words,"
said Jones. Michael Brandon, the
Editor-in-Chief at the time, was in-
censed, ultimately accusing the
printer of censorship.

Glen Leggett, President of the
Collegedttring thisperiod.dismissed
the issue in a recent phone interview,
“Students wanted to print the word
‘shit' every once in a while, and we
usually let them do it."

Continued Leggett, ‘The staff at
the timeoften only had halfthe story.
Theyweresoanti-administration that
they were blind to many aspects of
the issues.”

Still, said Leggett. “It‘s abso-
lutely necessary for a college news-
paper to exist at Grinnell. After all,
1200 students areenrolied there; they
ought to be able to express them»
selves. That’sjustthc American way
of life, isn't it?"
