HIE big hairy gorilla seen in
T termittently on the Grinnell

College campus since 1990
revealed last week that it is not a
gorilla at all, but actually an
anonymous Student wearing a
gorilla suit.

The shocking revelation came
with an announcement that the stu-
dent, now a senior, plans to retire
from the role and pass the gorilla suit
to a successor deemed worthy by the
departing ape.

“There is a time in everyone’s
life when sheor hesimply mustmove
on,” said the student. hereafter idenr

leave the suit behind. I very much
look forward to passing it on to one
who will use it to perform the tasks
that come with its possession,“ G
added.

And what are those tasks? Ac»
cording to G, the gorillashould shake
those who see it into new awareness
of their surroundings.

“One could apply Martin
Buber’sidcaofihe ‘I-thou’ scheme,"
G mused. “In many environments.
people move about, act in stan-
dard ways. and fail to see that all
around them is a universe of won-
der.

“The purpose of the gorilla is to
startle—to wake these people from
their sleep and encourage more ‘I-
thou' relationships among each
other," G said.

G asserted that passing the suit
to someone else will not inhibit or
diston the gorilla’s purpose. “It
draws on universal qualities which
are inherent in every human being
who believes that people take for
granted the supposed predictability
of affairs," 0 said.

BuiG was quick to add that not
just anyone can fill the gorilla’s
‘shoes.’ G’s plans for a selection
process include lengthy. provocar

party.

“The suit is neither good nor
evil in itself, but if it falls into the
wrong hands, the results could be
disastrous. The station ofthe gorilla
must be ﬁlled by a person with a
spirit of mirth,justice, and peaceful
rebellion." C said.

guarded secret identity. G said that
he thinks it a fair test.

“I feel that those who are ardent
and dedicated enough to the ideals
which the suit represents will be
able to contact me," G said.

G said that

up to cure a

”In fall

lomness, Itold
some friends of my dream to own a
gorilla suit and to startle motorists
along vacant Iowa highways. Some-
where around twenty people chipped
in the money, blindfolded me, and
bestowed the suit upon me," G re-
called.

grunted and growled,and vanished!"
G said.

Quad Supervisor Sandy Gulick
said that she was unprepared for the
gorilla’s appearance. It was her first
year on thejob, and she remembered
the gorillaas “loud, fierce. and fast...
I had to look lwicejust to see what it
was,“ Gulick said.

Since its first appearance in
Quad, the gorilla has tumed up in
Cowles dining hall, in Burling Li-
brary, along the loggias, by the side
of Iowa roads, on the campuses of
Carleton and St. Olafcoilegcs,and in
the l993A.GarthI(ranjekSGApresi-
dential campaign.

In 1991, the gorilla appeared on
national tele-
visionaspart

ing the incident, Gulick said. “There
was an older fellow inside Captain
Crunch. and the gorilla scared him.”
Spiderman fortunately appeared on
the scene and rescued the Cap’n.

On October 28 of this year, the
gorilla appeared at the Halloween
dinner in Quad, where it again battled
Spidennan. Though it ended in an-

might remind you that the gorilla
does come back for more."

miss G.

“[G] puts the room into laugh-
leriil's what everybody needs, that
laughter,” said Gulick. She called
thegorilla suita“morale-lifter" and
added that G gives the gorilla a
unique personality.

“[6] brings the costume alive.
It’s notjustacostume,”Gulick said.

Spiderman said that with G‘s
departure, he would be missing a
friend. “After our first battle or so.
we became friends. But every once
in a while he goes on a banana craze
and I have to keep him under con-
trol,” said the web-slinger.

To whomever G chooses to in—

“Just make sure you're prepared to
deal with the consequences if you
make trouble."

Gulick, too, had advice for G’s
successor. “Keepthelaughter. Keep
the tradition going," she said.

She was quick to add that she
didn‘t want to see anyone get hurt,
that everyone should stay off the
tables, and ”Don‘t bear-hug Cap’n

G expressed some regret for
frightening anyone, saying, “I don’t

or the gorilla that nearly gave
you a heart attack on your way
