Chenette’s movie music homage
Will have Cedar Rapids premiere

Jennifer Prusak

T 8:00 pm tomorrow night.

A music professor Jonathan

Chenette‘s newest orches-

tral piece will premiere at the Sinclair
Auditorium in Cedar Rapids.

Along with Mom’s “Jupiter
Symphony" and “Elvira Madigan
Piano Concerto,“ the Cedar Rapids
Symphony Chamber Orchestra will
be playing Chenette’s “Triple Fea-
ture,"’a piece that is “an homage to
and a parody oi” movie music.

Chenette wrote “Triple Feature"
especially for this concert; he was
asked by the conductor of the Cedar
Rapids Symphony to be a composer

in residence this year.and to fillaslot
on this Mozart concert.

Although he admits he was ini-
tially worried about being the only
composer besides Mozart in the en
tire concert. Chenette set out to com»
pose a piece that would [it in well
Willi the other pieces. He knew that
“ElviraMadigan,” apiece that was in
a movie score, was being played in
tire concert, and he started thinking
aboutmovie music in general. Fid-
dling around for several weeks, he
came up with one of the movements
of his piece, called “Farce,” which
has many light-hearted elements
found in music from old Charlie
Chaplin films.

After playing “Farce“ for his

wife, they both decided that they
liked it, and Chenette decided to
write the entire work as a collection
otditferenttypesofmoviemusic. In
addition to “Farce." Chenette wrote
two other movements: “Epic,” a
piece similar to those found in ad-
venturefilms.and“Romance,"abit»
tersweetpiece that evokes deep emo-
tion.

Tickets are available both at
the door and by calling (319)366-

admission,86 for students. Any
one interested in free transporta-
tion to Sinclair Auditorium Sat—

hasbeenpertormingwith hiswifefor
over twenty years.

Classical North Indian vocal
music is associated with very old
tiaditions, which can be dated back
over 2,000 years. Each piece ex-
plores a particular raga, or set of
guidelines, which correspond either
to a mood ora tirneofday. Since the
performer must adhere to the raga.
each piece is a process of improvisa-
tion and no piece is ever played the
same way twice,

Indian classical music is a de

might practice up to eight hours a
day. Mrs. Shende commits her time
to the music simply because of her
lovefor it. Shehasretumedlolndia for

Black Box study break
returns this afternoon

valuable Grinnell arts tradition, according to cororganizer Todd
Erler. Today’s show begins at4:24 in the Flanagan Arena Theatre.

Erlet calls Black Box "a mixtureofcrealive absurdity and quality,”
and says that people attend for ”pure enjoyment. a chance to show off
a talent that you have, whether it be writing in wet shaving cream on
your chest or playing the guitar."

Past Black Box breaks have featured musicians, performance
artists, jugglers and poets. Erler said that the safe nature of the
performance space brings out creativity that would otherwise be unoxA
pressed.

“For people who don‘t normally get the chance to perform, audi~
cnces at Black Box are polite and accepting, and the quality has
remained high." he said.

“I miss Black Box because it was such a place where people could
go up and do the absurd or the unrehearsod, and there was no place else
where they could do that," Erler said. “It's an incredible forum for
exploring the unexplored."

Performances at post Black Box breaks have been memorable.
More than once, an outpouring of human compassion, combined with
ingenuity and talent, has saved a performer.

“A woman wentup to sing asong and her guitarist didn‘tshow up,
so Dart Sharp went up and played guitareven though he didn’t know the
song,” Erler recalled. Sharp picked up the tone after she hummed a few
bars, “He played it anyway and it worked.“ said Erler.

He hopes that “people will continue to participate in a low-stress,
fun, creative atmosphere" provided by Black Box.
