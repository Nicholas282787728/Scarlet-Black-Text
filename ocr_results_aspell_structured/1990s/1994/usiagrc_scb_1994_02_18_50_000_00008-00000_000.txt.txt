Friday night. By defeating confcre
once rival Coe College, 138-113. the
Pioneers (12-7, 7-5) clinched their
first above-500 season in 30 years,
shattered a handful of records in the
process. and met their first challenge
in their quest to make the playoffs.

The first half of the game was a
sharp-shootingdisplay by both teams
with Grinnell shooting 71% from the
floor and Coe hitting on 80%. Early
in the half. Coe sprinted out to a 25~
16 lead courtesy of an impressive 13,
0 run. But Grinnell responded with
their own 19-6 spurt sparked by a
Diekmann jump shot and capped off
by consecutive threepoint shots by
the stand-out forward giving Grin-
nell a 3531 lead. The Pioneers then
used aggressive defense and lights-
out shooting to put together a series
of scoring runs resultln g in an 8061
halftime lead.

Shooting only 36% from the
ﬂoor, the Pioneers cooled off in the
second half. The lapse didn’t help
