I Week activities wtll wrap up
with a party tonight at Harris

Black Awareness Week f mo
tions as a preview to Black Aware-
ness Month in February,according to
Tasha Johnson, second-time activi-
ties coordinator for the campus orga-
nization Concerned Black Students.
Activities kickedofflastSunday with
amoming worship service at Herrick.
Johnson described the week as
”an opportunity for people to learn
about black cultures firsthand. with-
out having to read it from a book.”
Throughthe week,shesaid,CBS
hopes to promote general awareness

of multicultural issues on campus.
“Thewhitecultureisdominanl,
notchohnson,“and peoplenaturally
are aware of white issues. We make
up a much smaller percentage of the
student body."
Pollcdinforrnally,black students
and white students alike agreed that
while, in an ideal world, there would
be no need forawareness weeks, they
are currently an imponant oppoan
nity for interaction and education.
Junior Randy Edgell, a monitor
at the Black Cultural Center, added
that the week also provided black
Americans and black students of other
nationalities with opportunities to
learn about each others’ cultures.
“Sometimes."Edgell noted,"Af-
rican»Americans and other black culr
lures are notascomfonablewith each

other as I‘d like to think."

In the midst of a group who
showed mainly support for aware

affirmative action movement, which
he felt “helps minorities while disr
criminating against white males."

“I sympathize with these
people," Foreman continued, ‘
causeI realize the economic differ-
ences affecting our opportunities. I
agree that affirmative action is
needed, but I feel that the way it’s
been implemented is faulty.”

according to Jeanette Copeman, a
faculty assistant in Steiner.
Copeman received an e-mail

reported that he was “doin g just fine."
He is now living in Yellow Springs,
Ohio. He was to have begun teaching

Powers spent approximately two
weeks in the hospital during August.

At that time, the doctors predicted
only a five percent chance that he
would regain his sight, Copeman said.

“They told him that in aboutflve

Bun is sensitive to the fact that
some white students are genuinely
concerned and informed about
multiculturalism on campus.

”I speak the same way to every-
one.“ Burt. said. “You know, i don’t
try to soften my blows or anything."

While CBS would like to see a
higher attendance rate from both mi-
nority and white campus populations
at the activities, the general student
consensus toward the week was posi-
tive. As sophomore Elin Egeness
noted, “It’sgood for peopletorealize
there‘s more to American history than
dead white males"

ARSON: Rawson entrance sustains damage in fire

By SARAH WOHLFORD
Editor~in~Chief
UNDREDS of Grinnell Stu
dents residing on North
Campus were awakened at
3:15a.m.Thursday morning bya fire
alarm signaling what Student Affairs
is tenning arson.

The arsonist apparently started
at Dibble Annex, lighting door fliers
on ﬁre. Clark Hall also incurred the
same type of damage. Evidence of
burning paper was found in Gates
Lounge. and Rawson Hall sustained
the most damage. There, the arsonist
stuffed a wad of paper down the ray
diator immediately inside the front
door, poured ﬂammable liquid on it
and lit it.

The fire created a tunnel up the
wall, and sent smoke up to the fourth
floor. The radiator was burned out,
the wallsand ceiling were singed and
the bulletin board was scorched be-
fore the ﬁre was put out.

Junior Jomo Zimbi was walking
down the North loggia around 3:15
am. when he saw smoke. He opened
the door to Rawson and black smoke
camepourin gout, ﬁlling the entrance.

He and a friend contacted an RLC
and the fire department was called.
Students from most Nonh Campus
loggia dorms were evacuated.
ResidenceLifeCoordirtatorDan
Moir said, “We‘re very, very lucky.
The fire was blocking a major exit."
The stairwell acted as a wind tunnel
of sons, and if the fire had burned
much longer, the entire dorm may
have gone up in flames. The danger
of the ﬁre was compounded by the
fact thatall the Nonh Campus dorms

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

are connected, and a ﬁre in one would
mean a fue in all the others if not
extinguished.

“It’s disturbing in my mind be-
cause itwas the entrance of thewhole
building. If the entrance had been
engulfed. it would have been very
hard for people to escape,” Moirsaid.
“If allowed to burn, there would have
been dead people."

The incident is under investiga-
tion by the Grinnell Fire Department
and by the college. Dean ofStudents
Tom Crady said, ”The police are go-
ing to investigate. It’s very serious,
In anycaseofarsonwe'dbepursuing

criminal charges. We hope that stu-
dents who have information will let
us know."

Grinnell Fire Chief Jerry Burns
said, “There is damage, confined to
the hater and entryway of Rawsonr
Since it‘s [Rawson] is an occupied
structure, this would be classiﬁed as
ﬁrst degree arson" The penalty for
arson is stiff, If an individual is
convicted of ﬁrstadegree arson, with
intent to destroy, or property is dam-
aged, it can carry a jail sentence of
“no more than 25 years." Arson is a

Class B felony.
