’ehicle inspections prevent breakdowns

By Riva Sharples
lSUAL inspection and

routine maintenance of
one’s vehicle isthe best

ay to prevent breakdowns on
e highway, according to Jun
thnson,amechanicatWesFinch

uto. Johnson and others spoke

students and community mem-
:rs at two workshops hosted by
IARLESS this month. Two
ore workshops will be held on
ecember 7 and February 8.
While no-one can totally pre-
)nl breakdowns on the highway,

there are a ”lot of things” people
can do before leaving on a trip to
ensure safety, said Johnson.

"Visual inspection is a big
thing anybody can do,” he said.
”While theengineis running. you
can check the belts and make sure
that there are no loops in them
and that the tension on the belts
is right. When the engine is off,
you can inspect the underside of
the belts and check for weather
cracks, missing pieces, or worn
areas. Hoses should also be my
spectcd."

I nell College Young Demo
cmLs hosted a conference for

ference. She explained that the goal
of the conference was to “get stu-
dents intcrcstett and tnvolvetl in the
Young Democrats.” Once students
were involved, the goals became
threefold: “To force [students] to
reevaluate young people’s roles in
public service, to move forward and
shape (students') own vision rather
than borrowing from their parentS,
and to challenge thelowa Democrats
to put more resources into the youth
of lowa.”

Governor, Bonnie Campbell; Dave
Nagle, a former Congressman and
probable candidate for Congress or
Governor; David Lyons, the State

insurance Commissioner; Tom

dent of the Iowa Young Democrats.

formative speakers, the conference
