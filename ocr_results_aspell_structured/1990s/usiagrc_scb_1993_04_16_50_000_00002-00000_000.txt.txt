Seven more movies than last year

Student Films Artistic, Revealing

Over 600 pack the Harris Center concert hall for annual Titular Headfestival

By Chris Maag

IX’I'EEN movies, lots of beer,

S bat-rolls of peanuts, and six to

eight hundred people all de—

sccndcd upon the Harris Ccntcr Sate

urday night tojoin in the experience
called Titular Head.

Once a year, Grinncll College

studans allow themselves to let their
hair down. They get pretty drunk.
they got pretty rude, and at the same
time they get pretty artistic.

“This is thconly cvcnton campus
where you see cvcryonc’s true nature.
Rudc movics, lcwd crowds, it’s really
intcrcsLing," said Ali Akgun. one of
four planners of this year’s Titular
Head. “Everybody at this college is

The movicsthis ycztrmngcd from

costumes; to political statements by

Group; to making fun critic Grinrlcll

“I think this is a really good
event for Grinnell," Said Sharyn
Obsatz, another of the event’s plane
ncrs. Evcrything’s always thc samc
llcrcitllc samc parties, the same
music, and this is a good way for
people to let off somc frustration, be
creative, rind show student movies
that aren't shown anywhere else...
Some of the movies made this year
are going to be classics.“

Titular Head has been acting as
an outlet for student movies for quite
a while, first in the old ARI-I auditoA
rium. The popularity of movies was
decided by counting the number of
beer cans that were thrown up to the

stage during each film. Titular l-lcad
was lastsllown in ARH in the spring
of ’89, took a year’s haitus, and then
thetraditlon began ancw in the Harris
Center last year. This year‘s event
cost SGA $220 dollars for a new
movie projector that could project
images directly from a VCR tape,
instead of a roclvtorrccl projector used
in previous Titular Heads.

Interest in the event sccms to be
increasing. Last year more were nine
movies cntcrcd, while this ycar six-
tccn wcrcshown, watched by a swell-
ing crowd that could barely fit into
the Harris concert hall. Obsatz and
Akgun, both planners of last year’s
Titular Head and seniors this year.
made a conscious effort to get help
from non»scnlors so that thc event
could be easily continued next your.
Junior Brcndon Riordan and Sopho-
mochilchllshclpcd plan lhccvcnt
this year and have been assigned the
task of planning it next year.

“We’re not really an official
group. We don't like calling our
selves a committee, or anything for~
mal like that. We’re just a group of
folks trying to put on some movies."
said Riordan.

All chills year’s movies will be
compiled ontoa singleVCR tape and
placed on reserve at the AV Center in
ARH for students to watch. The tape
should be ready in a couple of weeks.
