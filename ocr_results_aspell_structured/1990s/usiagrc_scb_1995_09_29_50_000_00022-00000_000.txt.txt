Sexual Assault Awareness

Program
To the Editor:

During the New Student Days‘
Sexual Assault Awareness Program,
the first— 'ear students reacted in an
especially disturbing way. The sem—
inar began with short skits dealing
With rape and the people it affects.
Afterwards, ‘Margatet' spoke about
mpestatistics and the crisis line which
serves Grinnell, describing its func—
tion and the work of student advo—
cates. Tom Crady. Dean of Student
Affairs, outlined the college’s policy
in handling cases of sexual assault.
Then the panel opened for student
questions.

The ﬁrst few questions were se—
rious. dealing mostlywith the assault
clinic and student advocacy. How
ever, they became less serious as stu«
dents began to create implausible
situations dealing with alcohol and
sex. “What if..."seemed to dominate
the students' statements. The atmo—
sphere became tense. Some students
felt offended, others angry, and the
panelists were very fnistrated. Ques—
tions were raised to provoke a re—
spome from the audience and upset
the panelists. [They] worked. One of
the most outrageous questions was
”Ifa man andawomanare drunk and
they have sex, are they raping each
other?" Some groups of students
walked out in disgust while others
clapped. The seminar was cut short
because of another scheduled event,
and ended with no resolution.

As members ofthe audience, we
experienced emotions ranging from
disbelief to shock. The fact that
Grinnell students would provoke the
speakers of such an important issue is
astonishing. The people asking the
questions seemed solely to want to
impress their peers and make them
laugh. There seemed to be a compe—
tition between the students in order
to see who could elicit the greatest
response from our class. In retro—
spect, the only word to describe our
feelings about the night is disgust.

The current education on sexu<
al assault is obviously insufficient.
For the most part, the program is very
light and entertaining, and does not
pose sexual assault as a very serious
problem. The Grinnell Administra-
tion mustcommit time and money in
order to address the issue properly.
Sexual assault deserves a serious fo<
rum supported by the administra«
tion. The behavior at the presenta.
tion is not only ridiculous, but also a
threat. We urge the membeis of the
class of '99 to treat others With the
respect and maturity that we all de-
serve.

The SGA Blood Drive...
Let’s Clear the Confusion!

To the campus community:

If you have not heard or read
about the upcoming Blood Drive to
be held on October 4th and 5th by
now, I must warn you: you may stum—
ble over your own life and not know
it! Open your eyes!

Blue flyers with appointment
sheets have been posted on all main
notice boards on campus including
dorm entrances... Red ﬂyers reading
“Blood Drive Today" have also been
distributed unsparingly... Orange
sheets describing who is eligible to
donate blood are undoubtedlystrewn
all over the place! And guess what is
worse? They have been there for
more than two weeks now! And our
famous campus memo has reiterated
it twice in a row already! So there
you have it; now you knowl

There appears to be some confu-
sion about what the different flyers
seem to communicate, andI am hop—
ing to clear that up. One thing is
clear: if you want to donate blood
(which I hope, as caring Grinnell
College students, we are all thinking
about), the dates on which to do it
are October 4th, 10:003me4‘00pm,
and 5th, 12:30pm»4:30pm, in the
North Lounge of the Forum. What is
unclear is how to go about registering
for this process. The BLUE sheets
suggest that you make an appoint<
ment with me, i.e. fill out one ofthe
appointment sheets attached and
return it to me by October 1st. This
is the way to do it! It means youjust
come in at the time you chose and
donate...you don't need to wait in
line or anything tedious like that.
Saves us all a lot of time! However,
ifyoushould decideatthelast minute
that you would like rodonate (which
should be avoided at all costs), the
RED ilyers suggest that that is still
possiblesolongasyouatewillingTO
WAIT IN LINE till all the appoint—
ments are done wrth.

So,YOU DOWANTTOSIGN
UP FOR AN APPOINTMENT
WITH ME BY OCTOBER ISTI

And of course you don’t want
me to bore you by reiterating the
importance ofdonating blood. Imag—
ine yourselfin a hospital, fighting for
your clear lire, needing every and any
single drop you can from m BUT
I just would not give up 15 minutes of
my study—timeI or pool»time or even
mealetlme to give it to you. Think
about it. it could happen to youl

DON'T PROCRASTINATE
ANY FURTHER!

Pick up one of the blue sign—up
sheets, fill it out and return it to
Khutso at either Box 9—06 or SGA
offices. You can even e—mail me
[MADUBANY].

DOIT NOW! DEADLINE IS
OCTOBER lST.

The Pro—Life Movement is
not Nazism

Dear Editor:

Iamwritinginreferencetopara—
graphs 11 and 14 of your September
22nd "Inthe Coffee Z“ editorial where
you specifically stated, wrth refer»
ence to the white supremacist and
pro-life organizations, . .there are
really people in this nation who be—
lieve that sort ofstuff. What is not
funny at all is to realize what kind of
support, specifically what kind of
money, these organizations must
have." To equate the pro—life move—
ment with the neo—Nazi, white su—
premacist movement is an abomina»
tion almost unworthy of response.
Not only is this equation a trivializa—
tion of the grave imustice ofwhite
supremacy, it is also a gross misinter»
ptetation ofthe praliie philosophy
The protlife movement is based on
the very compassion and enlighten»
meritwhichneo—Nazismhasattempn
edtosuppress; it reiectsthe denialof
lifeto any individuals,includingthose
\\'i[l’| mental or physical disabilities,
whose lives otlierwise are considered
expendable The pto-llfe movement
values life: it promotes enlighten»
merit, intelligence, and equality. 'Ihe
neo—Nazi/white supremacist move.
ment denigrate: life; it promotes dee
struction, ignorance, and inequality.
To relate the two is inconceivable.

Human Rights and Vege—
tarianism

To the Editor:

What do human rights have to
do with vegetananrsml When 1 was
interViewed for the “The Meatless
Choice” feature in last weeks 5&8, I
stated thathuman rights abuses were
one ofthe reasons for my veganism.
That statement was unsupported in
the original article and I wanted to
offer some eVidence for that posi—
tion. The meat industry is perhaps
the most abusive to its employees of
any industry in the nation. Author
JohnRobbin’s inhis I987 book“Diet
For a New America," states: “The
turnover rate amongslaughter house
workers is the highest of any occupa—
tion in the country. The Excel Cor-
poration plant in Dodge City, Kan<
sas, for example, had a turnover rate
of 43% per month in l980—the
equivalent of a complete tumovet of
its entire 500 person work force ev—
ery 21/2 monrhs. . . According to us
Labor Department statistics, the rate
of injury in meat-packing houses is
the highest of any occupation in the
nation. . . Every year, over 30% of
packing—houseworkerssufferon<the<
job injuries requiring medical atten—
tion."

In addition to this direct abuse.
there is the human suffering caused
by pollution from animal agriculture.
U.S. livestock produce 230,000
pounds ofexcrement per second and
agriculture is responsible for more
water pollution in the US. than all
municipal and industrialsourcesconr.

bined.

Finally, ameat-baseddietmakes
for an inequitable distribution of re—
sources. For example, it is estimated
that 100,000,000 people could be fed
utilizing the land. water. and energy
that would be freed if Americans
reduced their meat consumption by
10%. This is shocking in light ofthe
fact that an estimated 20,000,000
people will die this year as a result of
malnutritionandstarvation. Iwould
be happy to make available the doc—
umentation on these statistics to any—
one interested.

Concerning “A Need For

Dear Editor:

We, the members of the Stone

over, we feel that the Stonewall Re—
source Center, rather than segregat—
ing us from the rest of campus, has
allowed usto reach out to the campus

provision ofour individual space was
a very positive step on the part ofthe
Trustees and the Administration.

National Welfare Reforms
To the Grumell community:

I am writing this letter in an
attempt to get a feel for what people
on this campus are thinking about
the recent “reforms" that have been
going on in Congress. Since it is
budget-time onCapttol Hill, there is
the usual drive to balance the na
tional budget. As we know, the last
election left us with a fairly conser—
vative Senate and slightly more con-

Space Committee regarding a long-
held desire on the part of ASIA.
SOL, ISO, and Chalutzim for indi»
yidual spaces. lnour experience, an
individual space has provided the
students of Crinnell College a safe.
affirming, and confidential enviroiit
merit to address the issues concernr

servative House. As per the "Corr
tract ivirh America," promised to us
by various members ofour governing
bodies, the budget struggle has given
as opportunity for a series of ”re—
forms" that are purportedly aimed at
closing the three or four trillion dolt
lar budgtt gap,
