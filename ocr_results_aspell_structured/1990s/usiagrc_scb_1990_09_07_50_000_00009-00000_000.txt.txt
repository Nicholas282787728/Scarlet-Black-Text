Manager Fears Loss of License
KDIC Heeds FCC Warnings

By Sharon Obsatz

“The Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) has no qualms
whatsoever about taking away our
broadcasting license!" warned
KDIC’s new Station Manager,
Kevin Bartlett, at a meeting for
potential Dl's.

As KDIC, Grinnell College‘s
campus radio station, begins transe
mitting at 7 am. this Saturday.
September 8th, thissemester’s staff
will be attempting to promote a
more professional attitude among
its staff and disc jockeys. Barnett
c0mmented,“ln thepast. thestation
has been treated like a joke, with
those involved not as concerned
about following the FCC mles or
about how the station sounds on the
air. KDIC was up for review by the
FCC last year and was informed
that the college needs to reduce the
number of FCC violations by the
station.“

Even though KDIC is an Alter-
native “notefor-proflt” campus ra—
dio station, it is still bound by the
FCC guidelines, which, forexample
prohibitpmfanitybytheDJrs while
on the air. These rules also forbid
the formatting of sexually explicit
or profane songs during the hours
which young children might be
listening. which is usually consid-
ered to be all daytime hours before
8 pm. Last semester. KDIC re-
ceived a few complaints from cam-
pus andcommunitymembersabout

“offensive" songs being played
during the daytime hours, and some
KDIC discjockeys were disciplined
for using profanity over the air.

Bameucommented thattthCC
isgotngtobeeven morestrictabout
violations this year, explaining,
“With a recent change in Chairper»
sort, the FCC has adopted the atti-
tude lhatcollege radio stations have
been taking too many liberties with
their First Amendment rights."
While Barnett admittcd that some
Dis may not like being told what
songsthey cannot play, he asserted,
“We‘re more concerned with hav-
ing the station keep its license than
appeasing a few Dis." Therefore,
this semester, the KDIC staff has
decided to "come down hard" on
DJ.s who violate me FCC mles.
disciplining them with verbal
warnings, one week suspensions
and, if necessary, dismissal for re
peated violations. '

On a more positive note, KDIC
is also seeking to better fulﬁll its
commitment to the Grinnell com-
munity this semester by increasing
the station'sinvolvementinthearea
of community service. Thestation's
staff plans to encourage the more
frequent airing of community ser-
vice announcements. There is also
talk of inviting grudesohool chil-
dren to visit the station and perhaps
to participate in the radio shows,
Barnett also mentioned that some

munications at Grinnell High

Sharer Exhibits Pastels
in Terrace Art Gallery

By Jennifer Manes

A striking collection of water-
colors and pastels is currently on
display at the Forum Terrace Gal-
lery. The exhibit, titled “Paints,
Pastels and Pastiche,“ is by senior,
art major Missy Sharer. As director
of the Terrace Gallery this semes-
ter, Sharer set up the display her-
self, which will run until Sept. 21.

The exhibit includes many
country and urban scenes drawn
from local Iowa. Sharer said that
her rural scenes were particularly
inﬂuenced by art art class she took
last semester, taught by Associate
Professor of Art Robert’McKibbin,
who specializes in this subject

mauer himself. Many of her rvctic
scenes, particularly “83111me the
Highway,"haveaquictlyevocative
mood. Sharer’s urban renderings.
such as“Brooklyn Hotel," posess a
bright, vibrant tone, and several
were inspired by the unique archi-
tecture in downtown Grinnell.
The show is also sprinkled with
some still-lifesandportraits. Sharer
said such subject matter is fun to
work with since it offers so many

visual possibilities and is easy to
work with in any medium. “Girl in
Blue,”aswellasastill-Iifeincorpo-
rating an umbrella which is done in
somber hues of charcoal, are espe:
cially pensive. She implements
dark. deep washes of color in her
watercolors to avoid the pale,
washed-outlookwhichmayattimes
characterize that medium.

Sharer plans to get an "MFA.
after she graduates next semester,
and wants to perhaps teach art
herself in the future. Sharer en-
couraged students to contact her if
they are interested in displaying
their own work, which may include
three»dimcnsional items, such as
pottery, as well as paintings, in the
Forum Terrace Gallerv.

Bartlett feels that many of the
tensions between Grinnell college
and the Grinncll community spring
from a lack of open communication
between the two, and he hopes that
the station‘s active involvement in
community service may ease these
tensions somewhat by “conveying
the message that we, the students,
really do care about the commu—

nity.“

"Light" Exhibit Shows
Sensuality of Form

By Paul Midler

Artloversmayenjoycombining
hours spent at Burling Library this
month with a visit to see Grinnell’s
most recent exhibit of visual arts.
“DesigningWithLight"isacolloc»
tion ofblackand whitephotographs
by Carlotta Corpron in Burling
Gallery.

The works, featuring a variety
of subjects. all involve lighting
techniques. Most of the works
showcase fundamental as well as
complex shapes, all enhanced or
subtly hidden through the use of
light and shadow. A couple of
exciting, bold photos use themelhod
of time»elapscd exposure to convey
the cxcitementof nighttime amuse»
merit park tides.

In her still photos, Corpron uses
subtle shapes shaded to disclose
sharper, edged images, while rect-
angular or harder shapes submit to
serene shading. Shc carcfullyIights
a montage of rectangles to show
how soft the lines can be made
through subtle lighting. A group
ing of regular eggs, with the aid of
some obscure reﬂective surfaces.
have a more bleak, stiff image.

Most of the lighting obscures

the original objects beyond recog»
nition, though the effect is usually
speciﬁc. Even though the objects
may notalways be recognizable in
some photos, the viewer perceives
thatthrough smooth lines and gentle
shadings the artist is suiving for
sensuality of form.

Though one cannot see the rides
themselves in the photos of the
amusement park, the bright motion
conveys precisely the thrill of tho
event itself.

Imagery appears in several of
thephotographs. In one panicularly
enjoyable work, a fossilized nauti-
lus shell makes an effective back-
drop to an almost completely white
egg. Perhaps it is old contrasted
with new; unbirth posed against a
permanent deathelike state; or the
image of shared imprisonment: one
frozen in rock, the other within an
unbreakable shell.

These photographs may be
difﬁcult to look at. Some. as sym-
bolic pieces, are hard to interpret,
and an even greater number take a
goodly imagination torecognize as
objects of this world. This exhibit
will at least stimulate the curious
who are willing to make the trip
downstairs.
