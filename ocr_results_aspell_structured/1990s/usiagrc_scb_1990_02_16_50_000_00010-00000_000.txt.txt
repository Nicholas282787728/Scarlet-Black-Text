ancestors or Africans today. This
is undoubtedly true. Even though
an African-American would
generally have more in common
with an African-American than
with other Americans. and even
though much of what they have
in common is their “African-ness“,
still it beneﬁts nobody to reduce
Africa or Ancient Africa to a
metaphorical mother-country.
Africa's‘hiswry didn't begin witll
tlte slave trade. Nor did it end with
colonialism. Forallofoursolidarity,
the nations of Africa are distinct

are distinct from Americans.
Chavez claims that the reason
she has more in common with
African-Amelicans than she has
with Mexicans or they with
Africans is that. contrary to this
talk of multiculturality, they
share a common culture. Cool,
but then she makes a leap of
logic Io claim that that culture is
derived solely from the European
principles on which it was
founded by our illustrious
forefathers. This thinking makes

a metaphorical motheracountry out
of England, Greece, and Rome,
which, again. beneﬁts nobody.
Sure we all recognize her quote
“There’s the rub" as coming
from Shakespeare. But don't
we also recognize “Please, don’t
throw me in the briar patch!”
as coming from an Uncle Remus

story, or ”There’s no place like
home" as coming from The Wizard
of Or? What I’m saying is
that American culture is not
only the sum of what its ethnic
groups have brought to it. It
is distinct. Sophocles and the
Magna Carta have no more
cultural hold on us than peanut

butter and Bugs Bunny and
Yuppies and jazz. They are
imponant to our understanding of
our ownculture and our place in the
world. But then again, so is the
study of the histories and cultures of
all nations.

Mandela, himself, personifies the
aspiration for freedom and
democracy, the very ideals he has
fought for more that 30 years. most
of thattirnefrom insideaprison; the
very ideals that, as hedeclared at his
trial 27 years ago, he was “prepared
to die for," It may surprise some
people that Mandela is elevated
almost to a level of deity. but he
deserves every bit of the respect
that is being paid to him.

Mandela is indeed a man of total
integriIY.dignity.and wisdom. His
integrity was apparent in his refusal
to accept repeated offers from Mr.
Pieter Botha, former president of

A Smia Thanks-
to those of you who generously

donated mpnc to the Child
Sponsorship 'nistry, Food for

the Hungry. Tuesday evening,
small troops of students roamed

South Africa, to release him on the
condition that he renounce armed
struggle as a means for black South
Africans to let the white
government, and indeed the whole
world, know that my are serious
about obtaining their freedom. of
course this strategy was soughtonly
as a measure of last resort
Mandela is also dignified in the
total respect and admiration that he
commands from people
everywhere. And, he demonstrated
his wisdom once again in his
realizationofhow toreactand adjust
to new situations. Indeed, one of
theconditions thathelaidoutbefore
accepting his release was thelifting
of the state of emergency. But,
there came a point when Mr.

Mandelarecognizedthatitwasmore
importantforhim tobeoutof prison
and to take pan in the negotiations
which must result in universal
suffrage for all the people of South
Africa. And even though the state
of emergency is still in effect though
we hope it will soon be lifted,
Mandela accepted to be released,

And so, we salute Mandela and
the people of South Africa, for
carrying on the struggle for freedom
and democracy and dignity and
peace. And when we say so, we
speak for the Steven Biko's, the
Martin Luther King‘s, the 700
schmlchildrenwhoweremassacred
in Soweto in 1976, and thousands
of other activists killed because of
their aspiration for ﬁrewom.

Once again. justice has done
justice. The chains of oppression—
whether it be in Eastern Europe or
in South Africaiare being broken
And the people of South Africa
havejust begun a long journey along
an arduous path that must lead
them to a democratic society, one in
which the leaderswill beelected on
a one person—one-Vote basis.

In the ﬁnal analysis, Sunday Feb.
11, 1990, was a day of joy, of
exhilaration, of hope. and of
celebration. But. mostimportantly,
it was a day of victory, not only for
the living legend, Nelson Mandela,
but a day of Victory for the people.
Viva Africa! Amandla!
