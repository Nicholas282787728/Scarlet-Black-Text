Faculty Teach-In:
Can a Middle East
War he Avoided?

By Tom Gregg

“We have already lost, no mat
ter what we do," said Robert Grey.
professor of political science, re-
ferring to current U.S. involvement
in the Middle East. “Our interests
have already been damaged."

Grey was one of ﬁve Grinnell
professors and 130 students gath-
ered inSouth Loungeto discuss the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis. Other faculty
participating in the Teach»In were
Howard Burkle. Rand Professor of
Applied Christianity, Associate
Professorof Anthropology Kathryn
Kamp, Professor of Religious
Studies Hamid Kasimow and Pro-
fessor of Political Science Wayne
Moyer.

Moyeropened theTeach-In with
areading of achronology of events
from Iraq‘s Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait in the presenL detailing in
particular UtN. sanctions and the
massive U,S. buildup in Saudi
Arabia

Kasimow followed with an out»
line oflslam. He said that it is “one
of the most unknown religions in
the United States,” although there
are more than 900 million believers
worldwide. Like all religions it
claims to possess the ﬁnal truth
and, like Buddhism and Christian-
ity, ithasa strong missionary ttadi-
tion. It is based on the same Godas
Christianity and Judaism. How
ever, Muslims also believe that
Mohammed was a true prophet.

Many Muslims believe that the
nation—state is merely a European
invention. To achieve peace the
world mustnotbet‘tcd down tosuch
petty designations as national
boundaries: it must unite in lslam.
But even given this, there is no
basis in the mainstream of Islam to
justify the type of attack Iraq made
on KuwaiL Therefore Kasimow
argued that the crisis was “purely
economic in character" with no
direct connection to the fundamen-
tal principles of Islam.

Next to speak was Kamp, her-
self a recent visitor to Iraq. She
observed that President Saddam
Hussein is authoritarian and runs a
tight police state, with almost no
freedom of speech or of the press.
Hussein also relies on a tight inner
circle of advisers in policy deci-

sions. He has developed a person-
ality cult around himself by means
of the medial Iraq is ofﬁcially a
socialist state, and Hussein has
typically wooed the people of Iraq
with schools and electricity for ru-
ral areas paid for with oll revenues.
rather titan with fundamentalist
dian-lbes. Iraq had been in a “glo~
rious war" with Iran and perhaps
needed to keep a glorious war go—
ing by invading Kuwait. Such a
War would have the added advanr
tage of control for Iraq over
Kuwait’s oil reserves.

Grey looked at Lhecrisis from an
Americanforeignpolicystandpoint.
He said that the U.S. buildup in
Saudi Arabia is the biggest U.S.
buildup in a foreign country since
Vietnam. and that the U.S. diplo—
matic initiative was “equally im-
pressive," involving much “and
twisting" and "calling in of old far
vors“ to create an alliance in the
UN. and the international com-
munity against Iraq. He added that
the Middle East is second only to
Western Europe in terms of U.S.
interests. which include the desire
to defend Israel and access to an

acceptablyapriced supply of oil for

the US. and its allies.

But Grey saw the situation as
being extremely dangerous. He
argued that the intensiﬁcation of
Arab nationalism could lead to the
downfall of pro-Westem leaders
such as Jordan‘s King Hussein.
Regardingo'tl,in the worstwarsce-
nario,oilﬁeldsandpipelineswould
be cut off. in the best scenario, the
internal stability of the Middle
Eastern states would be under
mined, increasing the likelihood of
high oil prices. He did not believe
that righting could be avoided.

Buckle based his lecture from
experiences from his recent sabr
batical in Israel where he sensed
that there is “deep fnisu'aLlon" with
the cuncnt state of affairs. As for
the occupied territories, “It‘s the
quiet before the storm,l think.“ He
added that the Palestinians are
identifying with Hussein, and if the
situation stays the same, the upris-
ing in the territories will heat up.

Moyer took a wider perspective
on the matter, stating emotionally

Iana Stashonok and Dan Stillson

By Daniel Bliss

When eight Soviet students from the Henzen
Institute in LeningradcametoGrinnell in the spring
of 1989, Dan Stillson was a sophomore. At ﬁrst he
simply wanted to get to know them. But now he is
married to one.

After months of ﬁlling out paperwork and waita
ing. Iana Stashonok returned to America and was
married to Stillson
in July.

Stashonok ﬁrst
catnetoGrinnell on
an exchange pro-
gram. But it was
not as free an expe-
rience as she would
have liked.

“I was depend-
ent on the group,"
she said, adding
thatwtlile tlley were
not under direct
supervision, the
professor travelling with them always kept an eye
over their activities.

By the time she left campus in May, 1989
to return to Leningrad for her ﬁnal year, she
and Stillson had decided to keep in contact. They
both intended to see each other again, and this
required considerable planning‘in advance. It took
over three months for Stillson to complete all the
necessary forms and travel to Leningrad in Decem-
ber. But this inconvenience was relatively minor
compared to the trouble Stashonok had in order to
get a tourist visa to come to the United States after
her graduation. This process took six months.

Indeed the American bureaucracy is proving to
be much more difﬁcult titan that of the Soviet
Union. Because of the unstable situation in the
Soviet Union, Stashonok and Stillson decided to

many immediately to ensure they would beable to
stay together, But Stashonok has still not obtained
residency in the United States, a process which will
begin next week. They are not very optimistic on
their chances of success, noting that the Immigra-
Lion and Naturalization Service has “a very high
degree of autonomy," limiting the appeals process
in case of failure.

“The U.S. red
tape is much more
complicated.” said
Stillson.

Stashonok felt
that it was much
easierto adjust to the
United States over
the past couple of
months despite the
fact that her first
experience of this
country was a group
experience. Having
seen the country be
fore, she has settled
in well. In particular she feels that the people here
are much friendlierthan at home. Although she has
never seen a large American city. she feels that this
friendliriess is not due to Grinnell’s being a small
town. She also ﬁnds the prosperity of the United
States remarkable, describing the economy here as
“flourishing“ compared'to that of theSoviet Union.

Looking to the future, Stashonok and Stillson
have notruled out going to the SovietUnion to live.
But Stashonok’s intention is.to naturalize as a U.S.
Citizen. They have noplans forgraduale school, but
would rather work for now.

“It would bean interestinglittle hurdle to get the
security clearance to go in the Foreign Service,"
said Stillson, a career both would like to pursue.

For now, however, all their plans depend on a
favorable decision by the INS,
