STUDENT GOVERNMENT

President Offers End

of Semester Comments

As I sit in my office writing this
columnatapproximately6:30am.
Ican‘t help but notice that there is a
little bit of snow outside (perhaps
the walk to theofflce from my dorm
in avirtual blizmrd clued me in to
this fact). With so much snow, my
thoughts quickly turned to the
holiday season which, believe it or
not. has some relevance to SGA
since we are again sponsoring a toy
drive this year for Mid Iowa
Comunity Action (MICA), a local
food pantry in IDWIL

Toys may be dropped off in the
SGA ofﬁces. We will also have
collection boxes for toys in each of
the seven secretaries’ ofﬁces on
campus for faculty members to
deposit toys. Most importantly.
however. we are looking for
volunteerstosign uptogocollecting
toys door-touoor in town. All of
the dorm ﬂoors should have sign-
up sheets by the time you read this
If not, and you would like to
participate, please Contact me by
telling [FERNANDE] and tell me
what time would be convenient.

Collecting dayswillbe Monday,
Dec. lO'and Tuesday, Dec. 11
starting at 5:30 pm. Most of the
routes should take a little over an
hour to complete. Ifyou would like
to collect with a friend, sign up
together, lfyou write to me instead,
simlpy mention thatyou would like
to team up with apanicular person.

Verybrieﬂy,on toother matters.
I’ve been trying inorganizea town/
gowncommittee with amembership
composed of college, high school,
middle school and even grammar
school students. I was also hoping
to have a representative from the
city government and a merchant
(perhaps Mayor Bob Anderson
would like to join).

As it turns out, Kevin Bartlett.
theKDlC Station Manageralso had
asimilarcommilteein mind, so we
have decided to join forces (along
with Heather Kenviri-Hietala from
the Community Service Center,
Kristy Leath from the local school
district. and Leah Burgy and Chris
Snyder. both Grinnell College
students).

The committee will be formed
early next semester, but we have
metinordertoorganizelhestructure
of the committee, decide on its
membership and come up with aset
of goals or a philosophy tor the
committee. This has the potential
to be a worthwhile group. The
working name for the committee is
the “Grinnell Community and
College Youth Coalition." 1‘ ll keep
you posted.

By the way, now may be a good
time for you to consider running for
the position of Joint Board senator
next semester. If you are at all
interestedlencourageyoutoaitend
a Joint Board meeting to see what
it’s like. We meet in ARH l02 at
7:30 pm every Wednesday. As
always, the meetings are open to
the entire campus.

"Get a Life!" Why?

When my friend Emily told me
that there was going to be a Doctor
Who/British Media Convention
over Thanksgiving break, I was
thrilled. I hadn'tbcen to a science
fiction convention for almost two
years. So I sent in my $40, dusted
off my 17-foot multicolored scarf
and eventually made my way to die
Hyatt Regency O'Hara.

No reviewing of old Slarlogr
and videotapes couldhave prepared
me for my reintroduction to the
world of science ﬁction fandom. I
had forgotten there are hundreds—
no thousands of men and women
who devotealmostall of theirspare
Limetolhe worshipofextinct British
television shows. They make
costumes. They memorize details
ofstarship blueprints. They besicge
poor, starving, obscure British
actors about lines of dialogue in
speciﬁc episodes which werehastily
produced 20 years ago. And they
really want to know,

I was reminded of a Saturday
Night Live skit with William
Shatner, as himself, at a Star Trek
convention. I looked around at the
myriad of eager faces and could

only wonder, “Have you ever kissed
a girl? A boy? Anyone?"

classics: they reveal a great deal
about the era and the society that
produced them.

In the skit. Shatner tells his
groupies to “get a life.” Ifgetting a
life means giving up the desire for
adventure, the admiration of heroes
and the search for new frontiers for
a ninerto-ﬁve job and mortgage
payments, then I don‘t want one.
I’ll choose the escapist fantasy
world over the real one anytime.

 

Conﬂict and Debate Mar Harvard Gay Studies Conference

It was Saturday night and
Science A, one of the largest of
Harvard’sscienceauditoriums,was
full Willi participants in this year‘s
Bisexual. Lesbian and Gay Studies
Conference. Sated from a day of
varied panels and speeches, and
also from the evening’s “Gay
Banquet," the crowd waited for the
scheduled perfonnuncean show to
begin. From the wings a young
man, short and stocky with a
distinctive bobbed haircut, walked
to center stage.

He seemed nervous, clearing his
throat several times before
beginning to speak. When he did
begin, however. his voice was
strong with emotion, pride and
anger.

“Iamgoingtoreadapoemwhich
is imponant to me, It shows me
who I am and is about part of me
whichrevealsmeasahomosexual,”
he said. “llisapart ofme thatsome
people in this country would deny
to me.”

He turned slowly. pulled his
pants down. and bent over,
beginning toread his poem entitled
“My Asshole." There was some
nervous laughter, several people
walked out of the auditorium, but
the pocm‘s conclusion was greeted
by a standing ovation.

Titled "Pleasure and Politics,"
this was the fourth such Conference
(the first three were at Yale) and at
the opening reception, the huge
turnout of 1200 Scholars, Studcnls
and visitors, and the diverse panel

discussions seemed to bode well
forits success. Many of the seminal
names in gay studies, Dennis
Altman, Jonathan Katz, Esther
Newton and Walter Williams, were
in attendance.
Whenlarrivedattheconference,
I was struck by the number of gay
people and tile feeling of comfort
and acceptance, that it was
unnecessary to hide or try and pass
asstraight. Among theparticipants
one could see the diversity of gay
people and how stereotypes are
useless in trying to identify an
‘average‘ gay man or lesbian.
There were indications from the
outset, however, of significant
dissent among conference
participants: several people at the
reception were carrying signs and
posting ﬂiers protesting what they
believed was the near exclusion of
bisexual concerns from the event.
By the end of the conference two
days later, the deep divisions in the
current state of gay studies had
emerged to such an extent that there
is some doubt as to whether there
will be a conference in the same
format next year. It appears that
lesbians and bisexuals, long in the
backgroundofgaysludies,arcgolng
to be more active in the discipline.
One of the most divisive issues
at the conference was lesbian
pornography. 'l'hatls,pomography
produced by and for lesbians, not
the artificial choreography oi ‘girl-
girl’ intercourse in films and
magazines for straight men, Susi

Bright, the publisher of On Our
Backs, a leading lesbian sexuality
magazine, gave a speech on the
objectives of her magazine. There
were silent protests from a row of
womenwhoheldsignsdenouncing
all pornography.

At the end of Bright‘s speech,
one of the women spoke and said
that porn, be it violent porn, the
soft-core porn of magazines like
Penthouse and Playboy, or lesbian
porn, dehumanizes and objectiiies
women. Brightspokepcrsuasively
in reply, arguing that lesbian porn
gives lesbiansandallwomenavoice
in how they are depicted sexually,
for pornography will not just go
away. Her response was met with
both applause and jeers from the
audience.

Therewereotherprotestsagainst
the organization and content of the
conference. One older man,
somewhat incongruous in a tweed
sports jacketand loafersexprcssed
his disgust at the conference
selection, An editor ata small gay
publishing house, his paper,
theorizing that HIV,thevirus which
causes AIDS, was actually caused
by a history ofsexually transmitted
diseasesandchronicuseofpoppers,
was rejected.

“1 can't believe it," he fumed.
”There's all these kids from Queer
Nation and ACT UP, and they‘re
not presenting anything. They are
not doing anything , ddelC, it is
not for gay stutlles."

I took his- contempt for ‘kids' to

imply my own presentation of a
paper on homosexuality in
Indonesia.

Old and new issues surfaced at
the conference. There was a paper
presented by Karla lay, a leading
lesbian author,and oneoflhemajor
figures in anthropology and
homosexuality was a discussant

At the conclusion of Jay’s
speech, a man commended herand
then said, somewhat fliptpantly, “I
am now certain,after hearing Karla
Jay’s speech, that we are one and
the same person."

There was an angry shout from

Bruce
Emond

thcaudienceandawoman screamed
“Don't you see what you‘ve Just
done? Your statement just
perpetuates lesbian invisibility and
ignores our achievements."

Their angry exchange ensued
until Jay intervened and said she
accepted the man‘s comment
(however poorly it was phrased),

PGA: Group Does not
Endorse Heckling

continued from page 6

somccommentsthatwereobvrously
misunderstood. Firstofall, heckling
is a rather controversial form of
civil disobedience. There has been
no discussionin ourmcctingsabout
hecklmg as a means of protest.
While Scott Wittstruck and I both
agree that it is sometimes
appropriate, I think that it is unfair
to assume that the PGA as a group
supports heckling.

PGA has never heckled public
officials. In the interview Scott
mlked about a nonrviolcnt action
earlier this semester where he and
two others heckled George Bush
abouthisMlddleEastpolicy. since
it was one of the first acts of civil

disobedience (CD) about the troop
buildup in thecountry, itreceived a
quite a bit of national media
attention. We talked about this
simply as an example or how CD
can be a means of publicizing
opposition to a policy (this is not
the only reason for doing CD, of
course). This evolved into a
discussion about the validity of
heckling.

Iapologtzclhatwedid notmake
it clear that we were not speaking
for PGA when talking about
heckling (although I did try to do
so). It‘s unfortunate that these
comments were taken out oicontex t.
