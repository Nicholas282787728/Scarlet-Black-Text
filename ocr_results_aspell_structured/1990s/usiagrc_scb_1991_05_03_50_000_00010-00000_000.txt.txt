more racism. If you make some
members of a group “privileged.”
then you create a predisposition in
people’s minds against all mem-
bers of that group, even of those
who are qualified. And what about
the unqualified people who are
new teaching, just so the institution
can put another multiculutral notch
in its bell? It‘s not fair to them. And
the people who are qualified, who
have the misfortune of being white
males. don't get hired. It is not fair

to them either. Or what about the
people. like Asian Americans, who
are not. members of “popular mi-
norities?" In California. they are
required to fulfill higher standards
than other students so as to keep
their numbers “reasonable.“ Is this
fair’.7 No. it is not.

One does not, however, need to
look as far as California. You can
look at Grinnell and find all of this.
Simply read between the lines of
the school‘s stated “multicultur ”
policy. and you will find the same

analysis. Does it lead to racist atti—
tudes? Invariably it will. Grinnell
cannot put out a message that we
will do what ever it takes to his

the message. And What about the
students forced to question them-
selves and why the school wanted
them? Is it fair to them? Is this
equality? No, it is not.

to “On Pride Week” surpassed ear

me and my work (see rodd Erler's

of how not to write such a letter),
they were informed by emotion
