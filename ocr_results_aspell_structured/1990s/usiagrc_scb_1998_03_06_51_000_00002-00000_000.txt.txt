’CarrierA/ert’pays off

Letter carrier Bob Christian noticed something odd about three weeks
ago: mail had been piling up atthe residence ofan elderly Grinnell woman
on Park St., not far from the post ofﬁce. As part of the US. Postal Services
“CarrierAlert” program, Christian notified Grinnell police, who entered the
house and found the woman lying on the floor, the victim of a fall. She is
now a resident ofa local nursing home. Christian was honored Tuesday
morning with a certificate presented by Karla Hansen, manager of post

ofﬁce operations for the Hawkeye District Office in Des Moines.

Giles Kline of Brooklyn actually
brought in an almost identical tool,
demonstrating how it could be used
for taking the cap offthe wheel ofa
Model T Ford, then the nut, all in one
quick backhand motion.

Since Around remarked earlier that
it may come down to a count, that’s
whatliappens next and although it‘ s
quite possible the same tool couldbe
used tor till three purposes the count
at this point. frankly, is almost a tie:
foiirforiliedoorcloser folks, fourfor
the cream separator and six for an
automotive wrench. That‘s plus the
butter curler and the grinder.

through New England in January has
turned dirt to have destroyed 2i sig-

trees which produce the delectable
maple syrup With which many ofus
decorate our pancakes.

Pictures ofthc downed trees in the

those in Grinnell last fall,

Turns oiii the loss ofthe trees and
their productivity will cost us a bit
more for our syrup in the future.

The new Prang Fun Pro Soybean
Crayons are the result of a “New

sponsored at Purdue University by
the Indiana Soybean Development

- Council. They are made from soy-

bean oil, a biodegradable agricul-

derived wax used in other crayons,
says the literature which accompa-
nies the crayons. The Prang crayons
are 85 percent soybean oil and 100
percent safe, adds the literature.

The oil from one bushel of soy-
beans will makc 2,112 crayons and
one acre of soybeans can produce
82,368 crayons. If the entire 1996
