Book Review: Two WorksBy Eduard Limonov

By Zorka Milin
Stall Columnist

It's funny how one simple joke i
casually made sparked an avalanche of
letters to the editor (okay, two letters, but
that’s plenty for this fine paper). I’m
feeling comfortable in this role of
provocateur, so you can be sure there’s
more political-incorrectness to come from
your onrcampus radical terrorist source
(actually, the U.S. Senate did vote to
ofﬁcially declare Serbia a terrorist state,
so you’d better watch out — or else, join
the ring). Anyway, on to the book reviews.

To paraphrase my favorite arts editor,
if you have even heard of the Russian
(actually Ukrainian) avanl-garde writer
Eduard Limonov, I will do anything you’d
like me to, let alone if you‘ve actually read
any of his work. The ﬁrst time I read [tit
me, Eddy, and Memoirs ofo Russian Punk,
(freshman year in high school), 1 was
completely blown away: first, by the
amazing fearlessness and honesty with
which, they comment on the important
matters oflife (sex, politics, music, love);
and second, the degree to which they
correspond to my own ccming-of»age
experiences. Okay, so I wasn’t quite the
bad»ass street kid that the 15-year-old
Eddy is in Memoirs afn Russian Punk;
but let’s just say there were some parallels.
Of course, it’s more than just a chronicle
of growing up and being “different" under
communism, and I trust it will resonate
with all of you outcast punks who, pitched
against the mindless crowd munching on
its sandwich of mainstream culture, just
knew you weren’t one ofthem.

Unfortunately, I’m not sure that
Memoir: is available in English (it seems
to be out of print currently), 50 I will
concentrate here on Limonov’s best known
Work, Ill: Me, Eddy (Eta ya m Edichlm,
henceforth Edichka for short). When it
appeared in 1979, the book caused a
scandal among the conservative Russian-
exile community, and was often labeled
as “pro-Soviet pornography" because of
its liberal use of Obscenities and sexual
explicimess.

From the start, we are drawn into
Edichka’s eccentric world. He introduces
himselfto us sitting on the balcony ofhis
cheap hotel room, eating botsch and
sunbathing naked while decent secretaries
in the surrounding Madison Avenue office
buildings look on with contempt and

curiosity. Unabashedly autobiographical,
the book follows a bohemian Russian
emigre poet, reduced to living on welfare
in New York City after his beautiful wife
Elena, bewitched by the glamour ofthose
richer and more powerful than Eddy,
leaves him. Just like the sprawling, cruel
metropolis that comes to seduce and
possess him, “Eddy-baby" can be equally
weird and sordid.

There are many parallels here with the
great Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky:
both are attention-seeking megalomaniacs,
and like Mayakovsky’s best-known poem
“Cloud in Trousers," Edichka combines
revolutionary rhetoric and violence with
a classic tale of love betrayed. It ties
together a series of seemingly unrelated
New York adventures by his desperate
attempt to exercise the memory of his
beautiful Wife, and his quest for human
contact and warmth on the city streets,

The interesting thing is, Edichka’s
sensitivity is not limited to his own pain;
it is also turned outward on the world
around him. And his political views are
just as iconoclastic as his sexual habits.
Unlike most members of the post-Stalin
generation who had been disillusioned
with any form of leﬂist ideology, he
idolizes radical ﬁgures such as Trotsky,
Mao Zedong, Ché Guevara, and Muammar
Qaddaﬁ, Sympathetic to the dispossessed
of this world, he identiﬁes with New York
Blacks, Latinos, welfare recipients and the
homeless. The central and most
controversial (also my favorite) episode in
the book involves a one-night stand with
a handsome Black stranger named Chris.

I love how he is unafraid to look closely
at the problems of the West, and, on that
level, the book is an explosive cry against
the betrayed promises of both Soviet and
Western systems, with their party
rationalism and prudence (which helps
explain why the book was such a huge
success in the once non-aligned
Yugoslavia). Whereas poets are
universally worshiped in Russia, in
America they are obscured by more
proﬁtable forms ofcultural production.

“This civilization is a paradise for
mediocrities. We thought that the USSR
was 8 paradise for mediocrities and that it
would be different here if you had talent.
The fuckers. There it was ideology, here
it's commercial considerations. About the

Book Review: James Ellroy’s White Jazz

By Joseph Michaels
Staff Columnist

James Ellmy does not pull any punchcs. If
there is nothing else to be said about Elltoy
and his book Wine joy, at leasrl can say that.
Of course, there is much more to be said of
the novel. who: 1m is a brutal, scotching
novd. it is graphicallyviolent. lt isan intense,
unrelenting novel, and l loved every page of
it. What does that say about me? Well, that is
a decidedly different story for a much different
time,

I have read ﬁve Ellroy novels now, and
each one of them is distinctly brutal in its
descriptions, That is the ﬁrst thing I must
convey. If you don’t have a stomach for
violence, for God‘s sake, don’t read this
book (or any of his
others, for that
matter)!

in Win 1m.
Elltoy rakes characters
he has previously
created and meshes
them with new ones.
His book exudes a
gritty, bleak realism
that is impossible to
escapc, The book, for
me. was extremely
addictivc. Not only
did I not want to put
it down, but had I left
it alone for any significant amount of time,
the plot would have becn lost to me.

The story itselfis set in the crime-ridden
streets of Los Angeles, and the story revolves
around a cop, Lieutenant Dave Klein, who Is
trying to solve a mysterious and brutal
burglary. The burglary ends up being more
than just a .un.of.tltc-mill case (thcy always
do), and it becomes an obsession of sorts for
Lt, chin. on top oftheburglaryinvestigation,
the FBI is stalking corrupt LAPD ofﬁcers, a
category Klein easily falls under. There is a
subplot involving an cx-ltookcr/B movie
actress that at first seems shallow and
worthless, but comcs to act as a spyglass into
Klein's personality and motlvations.And then
there is the ever-ptcscnt oucstton ofto/ry? Why

There are two
ways the reader
knows what is
happening:
newspaper
clippings and
Klien's own
experience

atedieFedsstalldngthepoliceiWhyvmsKlein
put in charge of the burglaryi Why does
evctything seem too easy? And why does
nothing tttl tight;

Klein is an atrocious, uncompromising
man. He is crucl almost beyond
comprehension. He is intelligent, but only uses
his mind to help himselfand those he cares
for. Previous loyalties mean nothing to him.
old loyalties mean less than nothing to him,
He rides above the law and revels in that fact:
He is a character that nobody should like. Yet,
strangely, lwantcd him to succeedThewhoie
time, lwas rooting for him, And that is Elltoy’s
gift. ,

Whitrjazzi main weakness is the plot. The
storyline is not as solid in comparison to some
of his earlier works, such as LA Cmiﬁalmti'al
and Kill" an :5: R044
(my personal favorites).
However, his writing
format hero is also quite
different. Thc story is
written in “real time" and
from a first person point
of view. There are two
ways the reader knows
what is happening:
newspaper clippings and
Klein's own experience. It
is a difﬁcult style to get
used to at first, but once
I did, the style executed
its purpose perfectly

Ellroy, like many writers, is compelled to
write. When he was a kid, his mother was
brutally murdered. The case remains unsolved.
His writings reflect the impact this murder
must have had on his childhood and they
reveal both his ability and need to delve into
the datkesr corners of his characters' minds.
Ellroy’s novel rtetets on the verge of
traumaticing, It is a resupared, complex story
that will not allow you to catch up oncc you
fall behind it. His novel is right in the midst
ofstatk realism. let me say this one more time;
his novel is brutal and unrelenting. That is
not to say “don't read it." By all means, do! It
is an easy read, hovering somewhere around
enjoyable. provided you're ready for What

W/Jiu/azz has to offer.
