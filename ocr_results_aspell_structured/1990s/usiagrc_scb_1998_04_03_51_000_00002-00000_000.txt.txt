A pride of lions near Malcani is an

unexpected pleasure, engrassi

Bill Nagel and friend Guy

He’s a great Guy, although only a
baby, a lOO-pound baby at that, and
he’s sweet as a pussy—which is just
what he is: A lOO-pound 18-month
mountain lion cub that is being raised
by‘Bill Nagel ofMalcom.

Aﬂer spending the morning Wednes-
day as a show-and-tell at the Wednes-
day Morning Clubatthe home ofLinda
Nowasell, he made a visit to down.
tow'n Grinnell where he was much
admired by some and treated Wlilli
uh, respect—by others.

Very docile and approachable for
petting, Guy was on a leash which
gave a certain amount of comfort, both
to him and to those who wanted to pet
him. He is patient and well-behaved
and obviously has been handled gen-

tly.

No, he has no claws

“Does he have claws?” Nagel was
asked. The answer: “No, but he has
teeth."

He isn‘t making his best presenta-
tion right now, Nagel added, because
his tawny coat is a little rough as it is
between seasons and he is beginning to
shed, so his fur is clumping.

Actually, Guy is one of five moun-
tain lionsatNagel‘s which grew out of
his daughter Megan's interest in own—
ingone aspet. This was about six years
ago, and the Nagels were fortunate
enough to find a woman at Mount Joy
north of Davenport who hand raised
mountain lions and who wanted to sell
to someone in a rural area who would
care for and nurture one.

Mountainlions strictly a hobby

Raising mountain lions is strictly a
hobby, says Nagel, and their family
- such, although it's also a
365-day-a-ycarresponsibilitybecause
not many kennels will take in five
mountain lions it‘ you want to go on
vacation.

Raising mountain lions was not ex—
actly in his life plan, he says, but it hats
given him a lot orpleasure,

There is a certain amount ofdcmand
for the lion cubs although the Nagels

prospective owner for responsibility

though actually such animals are ex»

Eat road kill, locker trim

The Poweshiek County Sheriff‘s
departmentknows abouthis hobby, he
adds, and they bring him road kill to
feed his lions, especially in Winter. Not
so much in spring, summer and fall as
the temperatures makes the condition
of fallen animals uncertain,

Nagel also gets trim from Malcom
Locker to feed his pets who are carni-
voresanddonoteatanythingbutmeat.

Their appetites vary, dwindling in

days without eating in hot weather.
The remaindcrofthe time each animal
eats four or ﬁve pounds of raw incur a
day, avoiding the fat. The trim inn
eludes such variety meats as kidney,
tongue, livcr and heart, which are not
popular with most people but which
the animals savor.

Codk retires after 32 years

LarryCook, who started work as a letter carrier here in 1966, retired from
the U.S. Postal Service March 31 after 32 years of service. Cook worked as
a carriarfor 12 years before moving to a clerk position behind the counter,
where he has become a familiar face, He has seen many changes through
the years recalling, for example, when the train was still an integral part of
the delivery system. Asked what he liked most about hisjob, Cook said: "I
liked all ofitr" While he’s not perfecting his woodworking skills, he will miss

his co-workers and the customers.

 

Despite cop campaign,
seat bet use declines

The use of seat belts actually de-
clined during the latest phase ofthe
Grinnell Police Department’s spe-
cial Trafﬁc Enforcement Program
(STEP), according to Police Chief
Michael Birmingham.

Police conducted an initial survey
Wednesday, March 4, at three sepa-
rate locations in Grinncll,

“Our pre-event survey showed a
usage rate of 75 percent,” Birming-
ham said, “A total of338 drivers and

passengers were observed, with 253‘

using their seat belts."

Ofﬁcers worked 15hours assigned
to STEP enforcement activities over
three days during the designated

, week. They issued 17 trafﬁc citar
tions to drivers, 14 ofwhich were for
failure to use seat belts, One was
issued for drunk driving. Officers
also wrote six warnings for trafﬁc
violations.

The second survey — conducted
after the enforcement effort — was
on March 25, again at the three 10-
cations.

“The post-survey results indicate
our current usage rate is now 71
percent, for a decrease of4 percent,"
Birmingham said, “A total of 326
drivers and passengers were ob-
served, with 232 observed wearing
scat belts.

“Whilewearedisappoimedby this
decrease, our results are still above
70 percent usage, We will continue
in efforts to educate drivers in oilr
community ofthe beneﬁts ofalways
utilizing safety restraint devices. Our
long-range goal is to have a seat belt
usage rate consistently over 80 per-
cent. Together, wc still have work to
do, but have come a long way.”

Blmiingham said that trafﬁc en-
forcement efforts will continue in
Grinnell, with special emphasis on
OWI, speeding and seat belt viola-
tions.

“We will be conducting several
unannouncedconcentratedtrafficen-
forcement efforts prior to Phase VI
ofour sTEP grant project,” the chief
said.

Right-Side -Up Mystery Object

And now down to other business,
the idcniiiy of the current Mystery
Object,

Marilyn Greer recognizes it as a
sediment ball used to collcct sediment,
and Frank Strovers knows it as an
automatic oilcr for engines and other
machines. He has used one mziny ti mcs

on cars, .Iohti ocei-c equipment, and
other machines on which he has
wolked. He was liiised when these
devices were now, he says.

Lauren James of Montezuma con—
citis that this a gas engine oilei but
illustrated upside down! l'lC used to
llIlVC its many as hitlfa dozen when he
still had those kinrls ofcngincs around
his place, he says,

Vcrlrdid Blockofl'lzirtwick who also
chidcsusiorillustmtingitupsidcdown,
calls it an oilei to old gas cngincs

Robin Brotlei 5, recently ietirctl from
the United States Nltvy, who has it
special interest in ships, says the oilcr
also has beeti used on steam engines,
specifically on Liberty ships built durr
lng World War 11, which was u little
beioic his time. As a history buff
viewing a program called “The oicat

ijlwraiiﬁl, . \

cg] nmdelikenom‘shtio' ,

Ships" on television’s History
Channel, he observed an oilcr iiscd
to lubl mate the engine bearings for
the huge pistons which drove the
ship, in fact a ship called The
Jcicini‘dliO'Bi‘lcn,nowmothballcd
as a museum in San Francisco, Ca-
lif

Two rcnticrs of the Extra also
have responses which ceho those
above. Jeff l'lubbell, like Marilyn
Greer, is sure the MO is a sediment
bulb foru Model ’1‘ Ford automobile
or tin old tractor, and Leo Schott of
Brooklyn calls it a drip oilcr.
