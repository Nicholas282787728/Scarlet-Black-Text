On whose authority are you pushing
me?” At first he ignored me. saying
“Yeah, shut up, go away." He then
became more confrontational; he took
a few steps forward and asked “Are
you getting violent?" This was an act
dwigncd to intimidate me,

Finally, when he realized that I
was demanding answers to thy ques-
tions, he called to an older man and
asked him to come over. As I began
to explain what had just happened to
the older man and to demand an ex-
planation, he too evaded all my quesn
lions, and he finally ended the con-
versation by walking away.

At this point, I was livid, Two
guestr of the college had just bullied
me away from speaking to Mr.
Buckley. I assumebecause ofthe way
I was dressed. In response, I got on top
ofaeouch at the eastside oftheroom.
where I tried to explain to the group
assembled what had just happened.

The reaction of the group was
almost as astonishing as the initial.
violentact. After I had explained thatl
had been intimidated for no justiﬁed
reason, I was jeered at, made fun of,
told twice that I “needed to take a
bath," and twice that “this was all just
a desperate plea for attention.” This
from a group of supposedly intelligent
adults. (Both of these accusations, by
theway, were false.) In fact,l gotupon
the couch because this was an inten—
tional breach of my rights both as an
adult citizen of the United States, and
as a student of Grinnell College. The
people in that room were not going to
be there much longer; most were Rev
publicans visiting from Des Moines,
and I felt a statement needed to be
made immediately, before all these
people left, so that the group might
publicly repudiate these violent acLs.
After the crowd continued to shout
over me, I realized this was hopeless
and got down from the couch.

There are those who say my ac-
tions on Monday night were rude. I
would be tempted to agree with this,
except for the circumstances. I had
been physically pushed and threat-
ened by a man simply because of how
Iwasdressed,and his actions werenot
only excused by the older man who
originally came over to me, but were
excused by almost everyoneelse there.
And peopteaccuscd meoi‘betng rude.
There were also those who said that
because they had contributed 51,000
dollars to get Mr. Buckley to speak
here, that they somehow had more of a
right to talk to him titan I did. I paid
518,000 dollars in tuition to be at that
reception, and I had just as much right
to ask Mr. Buckley a question as any
oneelse present. If these peopledidn’t
Want students to talk to Mr. Buckley,
they should have rented their own hall
for the event instead of holding it at
Grinnell College.

I have just one piece of advice
for all those on this campus, as well
as everyone else who were offended
by my actions on Monday night. You

had all better spend less time worryn
ing about petty rules of etiquette and
more time reviewing the Constitu—
tion of the United States. before that
document becomes as meaningless
to you as it has become to the man
who bullied me.

To the Editor:

Since myarrivalherealGrinnell,
Iliave had the occasion to hear talk of
racism. Such talk has frequently had
the strength oflegitimacy butoften is
incomplete and damaging.

This past weekend,altheTitular
Head videos, there was an entry coll»
cemingracism thatsuffered fromthis
kind of incompleteness. A segment
of the video had a student finishe the
sentence “Racism is " with
“. ..white versus colored.’

Restricting the awareness of rac-
ism to statements like the above only
siren gthensthemisconccptions which
fuel racist feelings. There have been
and still are racist feelings on part of
the Koreans toward the Japanese, the
African Americans toward the Kon
team, the Jewish toward the African
Americans, and the Muslims toward
the Jewish throughout the world‘s
history.Racism is hatredand distrust
without necessary appeal to “white
versus colored."

The misconception the video
presents istlie“oppressor/oppressed”
interpretation of racism. This view
ignores the majority of racistbeliefs
that existin the world. Most cultures/
societies havesomedeeprseeded and
apparently improper views concem-
ing individuals from specific other
cultures/societies. These are not usu-
ally oppressor/oppressed in nature.

Racist attitudes do exist, but to
inaccurately represent their nature
makes them more damaging. State-
ments such as, ”Racism is white ver-
sus colored,” improperly assigns the
role of villain to a specific group and
allows an extraordinary amount of
energyiobedirectedagainstdiatgroup.
This only contributes to the inationitl
hatred between racial and cultural
groupstltatitwas hopefully thevideo's
intent to make us aware of .

AGAINST
CHIVALRY

DDRESSING a question about women in combat Monday

night, WilliamF. Buckley said thathe believed tl'iatotlr society

is still not out of the “age of chivalry,” in which women are
afforded special protections by men while bearing special burdens at
their behest. He said that a sound case can be made that warfare today
is more a technical exchange (“like Pac Man“) than a physical testand
so there is no reason why women cannot perform certain combat
functions such as ﬂying fighter aircraft, tasks that do not require front-
line brute strength...

...but there's always a but. Assuming we allow our women into
hazardous combat duty such as piloting combat planes, Buckley won»
dered, what shall our policy be if they are shot down or otherwise
captured? How will they be treated by the enemy? How will our search
and rcscuepolicies beaffected by the gender ofour POWs‘ZI say all these
questions are irrelevant. Buckley iscorrectthatour society isnotyet free
of its chivalrous mindset, but I think that now is as good a time as any
to deaden or strip away entirely its final foul vestiges.

This so-called chivalry serves so many evil ends and it hurts
members of both sexes with a comparable brutality. On one hand, it
spares females from cenain violent expectations placed on the young
men ofour society. On the other
Wake-Up Call
women the privilege of serving

theircountryin combat. Weean’t

afford to waste any Americans,

as Clinton said last summer.

Chivalry sometimes serves to I abxfm ‘

in barroom brawls (even women ’

who can hold their own in a good fight), but it also denies justice to
weaker groups of men. To wit, Crae Pridgen’s heating by three Marines
in a North Carolina gay bar. The offenders could have gotten thirty days
injail ora $50 fine. Hitting a woman in aNorth Carolina bar will puta

Iguess it’s nice that we try to deter men from hurting women. who
might sometimes be physically weaker, but it just doesn't work. The
chivalrous bent ofour laws does nothing to spare women from domestic
and sexist violence, and I submit that our sexist laws serve only to
inculcate and reinforce the culture of violence. guarantee that men will
will be kept down professionally (at best) and probably imprisoned
forever in the victim role. Chivalry, good riddance, you brutalize society
and make us all weak.

But what do we do when scrviee womcn are held prisoner by the
enemy. Buckley wondered. The same thing we do when service men are
alive. And we shrug offall baggageabout the fairer sex. It is a factofwar
that people, both soldiers and civilians, women and men, are tortured,
raped, murdered and beaten, gunned down and blown up. It’s not nice,
it’s not genteel, but it is the nature ofwarfare and, I think, a good reason
why we might try to avoid having any more ofthcm in the future. That

hand, it denies to competent

ﬂ
spare women from being struck
guy in jail for two years.
remain beset by outmoded standards and stereotypes, and that women
captured: we hope that they suffer as little as possible and come home
is the most certain way to keep women out of combat.

and despite thenumerous problems—

home happily and excited, already
