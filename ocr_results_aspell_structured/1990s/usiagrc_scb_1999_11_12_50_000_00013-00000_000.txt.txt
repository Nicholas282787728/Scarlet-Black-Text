The Corner Flag

Out of control alums
return to take on old teams

By Chris Dietrich
Sporls Editor

one of my mosr eherished
memories or my ﬁrst year ar
Grinnell was warehing rhe men's
alumni basknbal] ymc. There was
one exciting graduate who made
ineredihle pass airer ineredihle pm.
The only problem was rhar he
wakas Sarah Dixon (old me mule
rlple rimes and mu rells me every
once in a Whi1670ut of control.
Ascending ro her. rhe guy prohahly
couldn’t even pass warer. She may
have heen riglu, hur ir was exciting
fastvpaccd haskerhall.

Alumni games aee alwaysa near
to wareh, cspccially here, where nor
only a single graduare, hur all
graduates, seem our ofcontml.

And then you look ar rhe cur—
renr ream. They also like (0 run and
wreak havoc. No, rhey lav! ro run
the ball and wreak havoc. And (his

is not some :uft sort oflove. k i: a

wham, ham, rhankyou ma'am, we
wi]l-Iakc-moreeshors-rhan-a-sol-
dicrrine’Nam sorr orlove. They do
nor rake shors in small numbers.
They press more often and mueh
more rigorously rhan a housewife
on speed wirh an iron. They run
suhsrlrurions like line ehanges. Ir
all seems so heerie, and is even more
so when rhey are playing a ream
rhar plays exaerly like mey do. The
game will he a shoorour.

The alumni ream always seems
so have more ralenr, and should he
favored ro win wirh rheir rhree
formcr AlkAmerieans. But rhey
honesrly have ahour as good a
ehanee as weseern movie srar Val
l<ilmer would have against Doe
Holliday.

This is because, as I rcalizcd
larely, whar seems ro he madness
does, eonrrary ro popular belief,

7 have merhod. I even saw a eouple
or haslserhall players looking over

plays roday. I'm sure rhe alums
aren't doing rhar.

While 1 can tell you ro go to
rhe men’s alumni game heeausel
know ir will he exeiring, I do nor
yer know whar ro say ahour ehe
women’s ream. Ifdicr: ever was a
sime ro make a lireeary analogy
about a hlank page, now is it.

The women's ream rhis year
srarrs rhe season anew. They have
eighr new players, and again, I
have absolurely no idea whar ro
expect from rhe ream or horn eheir
new players. Their game may he
eomplerely differenr. or it may he
rhe same. They look ro rebound
from a difﬁcult season lasr year
wirh rhis hosr of neweomers. A
good ﬁrst ehaprer would he a win
againse rhe alumnaca

on sarurday, the women host
rhe alumnae ream ar 7 pm. The
men rip oiragainsr aheir old team»
mares ar 1 pm. on Sunday.
