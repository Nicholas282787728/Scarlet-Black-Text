Zeiss explains that
here are a lot of con—
iderations that must
e balanced when packs
g. “You need to be
ompletely self-surfi»
ient and ready to deal
ith anything that
omes up ,” he said. “It's
ust a wilderness camp-
g experience, so you

needs and equipment
needs for anything that
may come up."
The participants
did a lot of ﬁrst aid/
rescue training and
knot-tying practice on
the ﬁrst day. No major
problems came up over
the course of the trip.
though Gardner said
that she became con—
cerned when a heavy
rainstorm came up one
night and
threatened to

substantial

Gardner
said that the

leading trips.
The week's
experience
was or prac-
tical value to
Gardner in
addltion to
the fun, as
she hopes to gel: a
job leading rarting
trips arter her gradus
ation this December.

ORP has

made the Bur.

ralo River its rall
destination ror a
number or years now.
In addition to the area
being relatively warm,
Zeiss said. "it's rairly
close, about a twelve

hour drive. and this
time or year there's
hardly anyone there.
so it's a real nice Wilder-
ness experence.”

De Beer found
that "it was really
gratirying to see that
there is so much [Wilde
lire] still living in the
U.S.” De Beer saw a
bobcat, a deer. and a
couple or bald eagles.
among other things.

The river's entire
length is protected.
he says. so “the water
was crystal-clear.”
The Buffalo River trip
produced a lot or en-
thusiasm in its par»
ticipants: It has spec-
tacular bluffs on the
side," Zeiss says.

Perhaps Gardner
summed the trip up
best. "It’s a beautiful
state," she said.
