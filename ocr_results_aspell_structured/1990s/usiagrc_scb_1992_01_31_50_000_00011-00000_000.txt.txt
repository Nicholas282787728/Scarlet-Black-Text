Women cagers thrive in Darby

by Alex Severens

Dorothy must have been talk-
ing aboutDarby Gym when she Said,
”There’s no place like home, there's
no place like home,“ because when
the Grinnell women take the basket
ball eourL there is no arena in the
world in which they feel more com-
fonable and secure than Darby. This
year, the throngs of onlookers have
watched the team run off to a fantas-
tic4-1 record inDarbyrand when that
statistic is combined with the previr
ous three year‘s totals, the learn sports
an impressive 367 homerecord. Does
the word dynasty come to mind?

Opponents of the team who
visit Darby Gym have come to fully
appreciate the meaning of “home
court advantage.” Head Coach
Eskildsen says, “Our group is more
comfortable here; they relax and just
play good basketball. Compared to
past teams, we are playing harder,
more together, and the women are
trying to create a tradition, I feel that
is worthy of support."

The homecourtis going tobe a
big factor down the stretch this year,
as five of the final six conference
games and seven of the final ten
games are at Darby.

The women have not played a
game in Darby since January 8. They
spent much of the Winter Break on
the road. Last week, the Pioneers
played two away games in two days.
Monmouth was able to put away the
Pioneers 6865, despite some ﬁne
individual efforts by the Grinnell
women. Amy Fon’s brilliant four
outof live shooting from behind the
three point line kept the team close,
as did Shannon Hancock’s ten re-
bounds.

Only 16 hours later. the Ho
neers were back on the court: this
time at Knox. The 56751 Grinnell
victory showed that the team has the
nmessary tenacity and desire to come
back from such a disappointing loss.
Of the satisfying win, Coach
Eskildsen remarked, “It really epito-
mizes this group’s mental toughness
and willingness to work hard.”

Mad Ducks destroy competition
at Luther-Loras invitational

by Dave Ressner

Last Saturday. the Grinnell Col
lege women’s swimmingtearnproved
that it got more out of its winter train-
ing trip to Florida than a good tan.
The women handily won the Luther-
Loras Invitational despite scoring re-
strictions that negated their main as-
set, team depth.

Scoring was limited to a team's
top two places in individual events
and its top relay. This rule hurt Mad
Duck last year as they narrowly lost
to Luther, 319-312 However, this
year, Grinnell prevailed, 3467292,
over Luther and five other teams.

Grinnell got off to a quick start
with impressive showings in the ﬁrst

six events. The diving duo of Holly
Kellar and Ingrid Swenson Look sec-
ond and third, respectively, on the 3—
meter board and then swapped places
in the 1»metcr competition.

Julie Cross and Karen Penko also
took second and third in the 1000
freestyle and, although they were
prohibitted from scoring, Heather
Langeand Caryn Platt swam to fourth
and sixth place finishes in that event

Grinnell then took second in the
200 medley relay. Senior coeaptain
Amy Oggel led a pack of her team-
mates to victory in the 200 freestyle,
to go along with her second in the 500
and third in the 100.

Finally, Grinnell capped off its
opening barrage with a first and sec—

ond place punch by Liz Fields and
Sheila Tom in me 100 backstroke to
lead Luther,158-112. at that point
Fields also won the 200 backstroke
The only other Pioneer victory went
to Andrea I ackson in the 200 breast“
stroke.

Grinnell coach Ray Obemtiller
called the win “a great team victory."

This weekend, Grinnell will host
11 other women’s teams at its “big-
gest and toughest meet of the sea-
son," the Grinnell Invitational. De-
spite facing such competition as
Nonhwst Missouri State and a num-
ber of other NCAA Division II
schools, Grinnell has “an excellent
chance to win,” said Obermillert

Track teams set sights high

by Jason Wolf

The men's and women’s
track teams are gearing up for their
indoor season, which begins to-
morrow with the Cornell invita-
tional. While the men‘s team has
several retuming stars, and is ex-
pected to fare well this season, the

women’s team is a young squad
which will need solid perfor»
mances from all the women in
order to have a successful year.

Men’s Coach Will Freeman
stated that there is a “nice cross
section” of runners on the team.
Strongsprintingperfonnancesare
expected from sophomore Rob
Yamachika, juniorDarren Young,
and senior Matt Schrager. Young
is the defending conference cham-
pion in the 300.

Numerous returning
lettennen, including sophomores
Barry Matchett and Mike
Nawrocki,junior Jeff Ulmer, and
senior Chris Garman, will head
the list of talented Pioneer dis~
lance mnners. In last. year’sleague
championships, Garman ﬁnished
second in both the 1000 and 1500.

Women's track Coach

Evelyn Freeman states that “we
are going to focus on training and
improvement this season." She
also commented that distance run-
ning should be a strong point this
season, since several women were
members of the Pioneers‘ Mid-
westConference Champion cross-
country team in the fall. First year
runners Amy Harris and Jennifer
Jacobsen, and sophomore Jessica
Henry are expected to lead that
group.

Last year, the women placed
seventh of eleven in the confer»
ence, but Freemen won‘t make
any pre—season predictions, say-
ing that she will wait to see what
happens. “The Cornell meet is just
atesting ground for us. We want to
find the correct events for every
body. At early meets we never
look at the score."
