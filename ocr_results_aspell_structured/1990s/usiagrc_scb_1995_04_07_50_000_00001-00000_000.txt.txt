Students to participate in NOW March on Washington

By ERIN HUSTINGS
Staff Writer

1TH the college's his
tory and reputation
for social conscious-

ness and political activism, it
shouldn’t come as a surprise that
fortyrseven Grinncll Collegcstur
dcnts will be attclidingtheMareh
on Washington for Women's lsr
sues this weekend.

Grinllell students will arrive
in Washington,D.C.Salurdayat—
leriiooii in time to attend the see
ond half of the Young Feminist
Summit sponsored by the Na»
lional Organization of Women
(NOW). The summit Will offer
workshops on topics suchaseam-
pus organization, welfare and
violence against women.

On Sunday, the participants
will be part of a daylong rally
which will also be attended by
performers such as Salt ’n Papa

and speakers and activists such
as Jcsse Jackson

The trip was organized by
senior Megan Lewis, who first
read about it in a NOW newslctr
ter, “I was really excited about
the march, so I wrote lo NOW for
more information and then held a
meeting to see how many people
would be interested in going,”
Lewis said The meeting was
very successful. so Lewis began
making plans for the trip.

Over one hundred students
expressed serious interest in gOr
inglotlieniarch. Unfortunately,
only about lialfofthe people who
expressed interest said they were
able to make the trip as a result of
lilghcr-lhan-expected prices for
bus transportation.

Lewis satd that she believes
the march drew widespread en»
thUSlasm in part because the is-
sues the event plans to be dealing

with are hot topics in the news
and on campus right now. The
welfare debate in Congress and
violence at abortion clinics, for
example, are important women's
concerns of which people have
recently become more aware. In
addition, sexual assaultisaprob-
lem that has been getting attenr
tion at Grinnell.

In addition, Lewis said that
she believes students are more
interested in the Washington
march than in actiVisni on cam-
pus because the march is a larger
scale event and is more visible to
the public, “I think people are
intrigued by the bigness ofit and
think it will make a bigger im-
pact than what they could do here
on campus," she said.

Students themselves have
varied reasons for participating
in the march. “I thinkmostpeoplc
are going [in order] to bea part or

a ‘Mareh on Washington,” said
firstryear John Chodaekii “It
scents like a once in a lifetime
experience, and everyone has a
special interest in the issue."
“On the serious side, I‘m
looking forward to hearing how
issues ol‘ multiculturalism and
solidarity within the Women's
movement will be addressed at
the rally on Sunday," said first—
