BY SIERRA SOLEIL
Columnist

l have been watching at a distance
the debate over smoking on campus.
I consider myself a non-smoker,
though Iarn not opposed to occasion-
ally sharing a clove or a ﬁne cigar
with friends. In light of this I can’t
bring myself to help try to push
smokers out into the cold and damp,
but nor can I in good conscience sup-
port the habil actively. However, I
have come upon something absoa
lutely unconscionable in lhe debate
over smoking: smokers‘ righls.

I can't say that people don‘t have
the right to smoke. I support physi-
cian-assisted suicrde too, as well as
body piercing. and just about any-
thing one can do to one's self. How
ever, smoking isn’t a closed system,
and the situation gets sticky when
you put smokers and non-smokers
together in public places.

I have no intention here of taking
up the usual plea of the sensitive non-
smoker. Instead I would like to place
both parties on neutral ground, i.c.
in a public place where smoking is
neither forbidden nor required. Here
one can say “I have the right to
smoke” withjusl as much validity as
once can say “I have the right not to
be exposed to smoke," In my sce-

Squares 0 Stella Tran

nario. both are true, and people can
argue all they want about who's right
should take precedence. The mles
will stay the same. and it will prob»
ablyjust come down to whether lhere
are a majority of smokers or non-
smokers in the room to decide which
rule to follow. .

Now let me extend this a bit. In

A place where strobe
lights shed new light on
the debate over
“smoker’s rights.”

this same place where we can smoke
or not smoke, we are allowed to wear
big strobe lights on our heads or not
wear big strobe lights on our heads.
Some will like the lights, and some
will ﬁnd them obnoxious, and the
same debate as before can occur with
strobe lights rather than cigarettes.
Obviously this argument doesn‘t go
any funher than the last one. But
consider how important the argument
becomes the ﬁrst Lime somebody in

that room turn out to be epileptic.
(For those of you who don’t know,
seizures can be triggered in epilep—
Lics by strobe lights.) For the epi-
leptic, the question of who has what
right doesn’t even enter into her
mind—it doesn't matter. What mat-
ters to her is avoiding a dangerous
and debililaling seizure. The person
with the strobe light on
her head still has the
right to wear that light,
but it is utterly ridicu-
lous to try to explain that
to the epileptic, and I
dare anybody to try lo
defend that right in the
face of seizures.

I realize that the aver-
age seizure is much
worse than the average
asthma atiack that one
might gel from second
hand smoke. but it is no less ridicu-
lous in this case to try lo express
smokers’ rights to someone who
can’t breathe because ofit.

In the end, I supporl more smoke
free areas on campus, and I also sup-
port designated places for smokers
to gather that are accommodating
and comfortable. But I will do this
out of respect for the wishes of smoke
ers, and not because of anything so
absurd as smokers’ rights.

This is it kids, my last column. Il

that‘s Grinnell. I have a great plan
to keep our most treasured resource
free from trauma, and we all know
what resource I’m talking about

my proposal is that we lock the doors
[0 Quad so that everyone needs a key
to get in and then atrocious foo‘dr

not grace our precious, egalitarian,

commit such an act, right? In facil
am ﬁrmly convillced that the food
fight was caused by a perpetrator
from outside of Grinnell. A true
Grinnellizin is, by definition, incar
pable of such an offense. Maybe we
should have Wells Fargo security in

I went to a fun yet rigorous, relaxed
yet friendly school. And that those
traits are the tradition not the excep-
tion.

had to say via letters:

Dear Iggy,

My only response to this is: could
you rephrase the question in the form
ofthe English language?

Okay, I have a question for you. Why
is all the water all over campus funny
colors?

This is good. I am a big fan of non-
traditional letter format. I think the
water if funny colors because you are
obviously biased in terms of what
you consider the “normal"‘color of
water. If you were a little more open-
minded then maybe Water with added
nutrients such as sulfur. plutonium
and sludge would be equally accept-
able to you.

Dear Iggy.

I have been wondering about my
roommate a lot lately. She tends to
put eggs in everylhing she ears and
I’m afraid that her cholesterol levels
Will skyrocket ifshe keeps this up.
Once last week I even found some

iggy,

why do We have to choose majors?
i'm paying for this friggin education,
I was forced to choose to major in a
discipline, but i don’t want to. I un-
derstand lhal a major is a handy thing
for those who wish to get some im—
portantjob or go to more school, but
i just want to be a well—educated face
tory worker or mechanic (or what-
ever else that would make me
happy). what do you suggest?

-rage against the registrar

ps. i don’tjust want to get a BA for
easy things like bowling, i want to
lake challenging stuff like chemis-
try. technical theater, sociology, art,
etc.

Hello Rage,

We have to Choose majors so that the
Registrar will have something to do.
Withoul bureaucracy then probably
half of the Americans who are cur»
rently employed would lose their
jobs. If you were really sneaky you
could also design your own technir
cal lheater/chemistry/bowling major.
The paperwork for that endeavor
alone would be enough to require the
hiring of 12 more people.

Dear Iggy,

I am undergoing therapy. Why? I
have very low tolerance for hands
that apply pressure to certain (most)
pans of my body, otherwise known
as tickling. A couple of my friends
have agreed to help me overcome
this afﬂiction. The ticklishness ces-
sation therapy involves me lying on
my favorite sofa or grassy lawn and
allowing people, with whom I have
a certain level of familiarity, to ap-
ply varying degrees of pressure to
places such as

Poor Lonely,

TheAshley Greenes of yesteryear are
currently far away. The lack of good
a cappella music and kneesocks
proudly worn casts a shadow over
my existence too. I hear she will re-
turn though and save us all. Relax,
the second coming is eminent; and
we still have the Dari Barn to tide us
over until then.

Dear Iggy. .
I was visiting the Grinnell campus
when I stumbled upon your colui'nn,
The wisdom contained in your Writ-
ings had been refreshing, and a
source of great inspiration. Unfor-
tunately. I must be leaving and I fear
that all of my future questions will
go unanswered. How can I answer
my daily questions and lead a pro-
ductive life without your spiritual
guidance?

iAn Inquiring Islander

Howdy lslander,
Don’t worry i won‘t be far away. In
fact I’ll be a lot closer than you think,
I’ll be leaching offof you for the rest
of my life. What a relief for all of
us. Here are some tidbits of advice
to keep in mind: 1. Your happiness
is your own responsibility, if you rely
on others for your happiness you will
not be all that happy, 2.. Take a
chance and do what you think it right,
it sucks to live with the regret of
missed opportunities. 3. If you’re
not having fun. do something else,
That should tide you over until I
move in and eat all your snack items.

This is the end kids. I had fun. Did
you? Anyone want to hire me to '
write more? I’m available. Good
luck and have a nice day.
