Mystery Science Theater 3000

By Joseph Michaels &

When I was asked to write this
arricle (okay, granrcd, l was asked
by myself), 1 really couldn'r decide
whar I wanred to say. Sure, maybe
some of you have heard about
Mystery scienceThearer 3000. in
facr, I'd hazard 2 guess rlur a ma-
joriry oryou here has heard orir;
afrcr all, we do so love no consider
ourselves our ofthe mainStream. I
can'r very well describe its wonder.
ful features to YOU7lhat would be
way too complieared and I'm too
lazy to come up wirh an easy dc»
scriprion that can be spoon-fed to
you. Maybe rhc besrway is so give
a general overview of rho charac—
ter: and what the Show is all about.

Mysrery ScienccThcarersooo,
or MSTBK as the show’s fans call
it. follows the life ofa human Shm
into space (onto the Satellirc of
Love) by an evil mad scientist and
his lackey. sound cheesy? Well, it
is. There are no such rhings as sci.
ence or history in rhis world, in»
srcad the show highlighrs sarcasm
and cynicism. And rhars abour it.
The evil scieniisr, Dr. Clayron
Forresrer, decides ro experimenr
wirh the human mind, and subject
his victim to the worst movies ever
ﬁlmed. For (he ﬁrst five seasons,
rhar person is Joel Robinson. Afr
rer Joel leaves the show in an es-
cape pod convenicnrly hidden on
rhe SOL, he is replaced by Mike
Nelson. Joel then creates his 1ch
able robot buddies ro accompany
him rhrough Dr. Forresrer’s nighr-
marish rorrurc schemes. Joel’s ere.
arions rake four forms: Gypsy,
Cambot (who broadcasts the trials
and tribulations ofthe SOL), the
esreemed Tom Servo and CrowT.
Robot. Crow and Tom both join
Joel (and larer Mike) in warehing
Dr, Forrestcr's movie experimenr of
the week. The result; a hilarious
mix or sarcasm, cynicism, and
crude lunacy,

Joel Robinson, played by the
show's ciearor Joel l-lodgson, is an
innocenr, unassuming man in ap.
pearance. And lfyou ever think or
him like that, you’d be making a
large misrake, hirrher proving the
deceprion of appearances. While
he is nor as ourspokcn as, say, his
robots, Joel docs have a number of
commenrs rhar could undercut any
movw, let alone a bad one. Tom is
rhe “reﬁned" one orrhe group. He
considers himself extremely well
read and knowledgeable in the
world, despirc tlic faer he’s never
been on the earth. He has 2 won»
derful singing voice and rarely does
he hesirare ro couple that voice with
his “upper class" sense of humor.
The {nor is, even Tom’s delivery of
l’HS llncS has a wonderful way of

poking run or the very elass Tom
draws his personality from. Toms
gift is ro turn even his least runny
lines (they exist???) into instant hi-
lariry, Which bringsus ro CrowT.
Robot, probably MST fans’ favor»
ire eharacror. And wirh good rm.
son, Crow is far and away rhe crud»
esr ofhis comparriors. Taer is raken
and boored srrarghr out rhe win»
dow with this guy, Crow is rhe to-
bet to rely on for illrplaeed, ill»
roned eommenrs rhar just make
you wanr ro groan. And Crow is
one rohor in not oncrodisappoinr.
Crow rruly shines when any :harv
acrers (in rhe show, or in rhe ex-
pcrilncm) are showing signs or
weakness or remorse. When a char-
acrer is showingsigns orinncr tur»
moil sit back and waich Crow go
ro work. The three also work ex-
rremely well as an ensemble until.
There are many rimes when rhey
will all work rogerher to express
somerhing horribly raerless and rhe
resuh, pure and simple. is comedy
or one orirs hnesr momenrs.

or course, all this blarhering
here really doesn’r have any errecr
on anybody. You won’r know any-
rhing abour rhis show unless you
Jusr waich it. But for rhose oryou
who are reading this, you can cone
sider yourselves asrep ahead in the
game, because you have been
guided in the righr direcrion; to-
wards rhe craziness nrrhe sorellire
of Love and the sarcasnc secror it
holds. And for rhose oryou who
already are faithful fans, I salurc
you.

the characters have rraveled far

somerimes do not know rhar some
characrers know each oiher, and
rhen suddenly they are chatting
like friends. When rhe him draws

In sum. Red Firecracker; Gum

FILM REVIEW: ‘Dogma’ crosses film genres

By David Conner
The California Aggie (U. CallfornlarDavis)

(UNVIRE)Afteran independenr blOWrup, a major llub
and asueeess, Kevin Smith finally goi die goahead to make
a ﬁlm his way. Neidier as simple as clerks or as polished as
Chasing Amy, Dogma appears to be smlrhs bor Lry ar
uncharactcnzing himselras a ﬁlmmaker orany genre which
we have seen him in.

About as oonvolurod in plot as aToni Morrison novel,
Lhe him is a work just to Waldl,TlK real siren, drough, was
undenaken by rhe wrirer and director . who has undoubtr
edly made his mosr complor and moss commendable work
yet,

Ben Aiiieek and Matt Damon are rwo fallen angels who
have round her way back no Heaven rhrough a loophole
in die Catholic doctrine.

Bur ifthey succeed, all life on mnh will end. Berhany
(Linda FiorellLino) is milecl upon by God to srop diem Jay
and silenroob (JasonMowes and Kevin Smith, nspeenvdy>
Join lierasprophers,alongwidr rhe l5rh aposrle, Rufus (Chris
Rock). serendipiry (salma Hayok) is a srripper muse.

This film is hard to plant. It corrainly isiira comedy, it
km a drama, and ir misro die mark on rEligious same as
well. Dogna is a very serious nlm wnh some good bin or
oomedy thrown in.

This new and euliurnlly conscious side orsmirh is
hardly blasphemous, and only a his herenral. George

eism will retire rhe “deproslng’ cross and renovare Jesus
withasmile, awinkanda thumbs-up insrerd ofpuncture
wounds. Whar he has to say abour religion isn't insulu'ng
as much as n aims roles to mouvare rrom “mourning
dieir religion" ro “cdebraung in“

So, is die him funny? ofcourse - Smith’s oomedy is
precious. Jason Moves is every bir as iimny as he was in
Clerks, and almosr as runny as his drinkpukepassonr—
drinleagoin performance on the ﬁlm's DVD void-over
mek This comedic ranosy grows cumbersome when the
comedy rclils on us innrasyenvironmenr, While rhe post-

modern inrerprerarions or John Hugws’ films are easily di-
geeeible, rhe parallel decorurruoa'ons oiGod are more oia
rask for smirhs anncrpared audience. While .r is funny to
wards Mcwes ranrasne abourscxwidr God’s embodiment .
a more Alano Morrlsene . we earir help bur dunk rhar he
just wane her ro go down with him in die rhmrer.

Damon and Aiileck are well—versed acrors in rheir own
nghr, but me scripr rhey are given demands drar die angels
be for more ﬂat man Lheir porenrial in ad. perhaps rhar is
bemuse the mosr serious conversarions we have seen come
our orsmiuls ﬁlms have been musing .n rhe male hnrasy
world orlesblan sex, and lhc misogyny orconnuering a les-
bian relarionship in the name orhererosorualiry.

Well, perhaps Smith is hr more inrelligenr man we ever
expected. lfso, Dogma is almosr irrerurahlc proorrhar rhe
