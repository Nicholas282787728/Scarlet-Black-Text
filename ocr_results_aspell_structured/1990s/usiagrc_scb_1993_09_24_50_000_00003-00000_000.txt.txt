while the people you work with snicker as you walk by.

This wonderful motherrlikewoman is Sandy Guliek, who has been working as
the Student Employee Supervisor at Quad for two years now. ln an interview with
Sandy,l was lucky to sit down and spend some time learning about many of her life
experiences and well as her posonal philosophies,

Sandy grew tip in Pennsylvania, with her parents, two brothers and two sisters.
Herfamily livedon a farm wherethey raised a multjuide of ditTerentanimals. Sandy
spentpalther childhood teaching people to ride horses.

and told hernght there that she seemed the typeofwoman he’d like to seule down
with Sandy happily desenbod him to be”one hell ofa truck dnver'and explained
how he’s driven already a million miles with no accidents. She then explained with
a smile how he often makes dimer for her, when he’s not on the read.

Sandy now spends her summers on the road, truck driving with her husband.
She’sbeen to almostevery state from Iowato the west coast Sittingin the cab efa
mick you'reable to see awhole lot more then what you see in a car, she explained,
giving you a boner view of everything around.

At the college, Sandy is well known for her genuine love for all of her "kids".
Everyonewhocomesthrough thedoorsonuadis irnponantloher. Inveryirnponant
toher,thatshelearnscveryone’snamte,whichshecxplainskocpspeoplefrom feeling
like they'rejust a number. She's had numerous students come in to talk to herabout
things thatare going on in their lives. She’s been sent ﬂowers, tenets and even post
cards from Budapest Sandycan tell who’shztving nbad day. and is sureto take the
time losee that they’re doing all right.

Sandy pulled out her list of Student workets. counting them and giving me a
grand total of 125 kids tl’ultshe‘s responsible for. This means figuringoutpayroll and
malo'ng sure surdent workers are doing their job righL

She explaintx‘l that the suidents 1mm a lot from working in thedining halls. One
thing theylcarn isthatatQuad,they allworkasa team. Shesaidwhenastudentdoesn't
show up for work its like a ﬂat tire on a car. If the tire doesn’t work, it screws up the
whole functioning of the Car.

Sandy feels one of the most important things in life is that people take the time
to talk with one and other, rather that ﬁghting things ouL She believes war could be
avoided if people take the time toview othta’s opinionsandare willing to give to one
another. “It docsn’thurt to give", she explained

Sandyrealizesthatsoonthespecial students thatshehazltheﬁlstyearshc worked

mying goodbye to her students, has been like saying goodbye to a family member.

Sandy has become a very tmponantpartof this college as well asan important
partmany suldent’s lives. Its notvery often when smdentsaway from home,<2ln find
someone who is as palientand as loving as a mother.
