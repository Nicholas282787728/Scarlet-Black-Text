Tribute toLegendaryActress

_ By Georgia Dentel

EGENDARY actress Lillian
I Gish’s death, at age ninetyr
nine, marks the end of a car
rcer which spanned nearly the entire
history of American films. It was as
the heroine of many of Director D.
W. Griffith’ssilentfilmsthatshefitst
achieved stardom. She went on to
make over one hundred films, win
the American Film Institute’s Life
time AchievementAward and receive
a special Academy Award presented
by the Academy of Arts and Sci-
ences. Critics say her best film was
Night of the Hunter, with Robert
Mitchum.However,nothing sheever
did attracted more intemationalartisv
tic attention than “TheRescue” scene
in Way Down East, in which she is
rescuedbyherIoverbeforebcingswept
over Niagara Falls on an ice flue.

To the Editor:

Last week in an opinion article
in the Scarlet &. Black, Konstantinos
Kambouroglou described the ineffi-
ciencies and tnsincerity of SGA of-
ficers and candidates. He specifically
madearefercnec to me,saying,“Stu-
dents vote for Dave I-Iatzfelds, who
make fools out of themselves by de-
claring that they are servants of the
student body.”

Mr. Kambouroglou’s ignorance
in the student government process
frightens me because I know that he
is not just an ignorant fool with too
much time on his hands, but rather a
symbol of all the people at Grinnell
who do not partake in or care about
expressing their needs and opinions.

I saw this problem of miscomr
munication between SGA and the
studean as a Student Advisor last
year. As a result,I have been as active
as possible in the SGA Vice Presi
dent position to seek out as many
unheard problemsaslcanitowhtch
Torn Zlabinger, Scott Irhig. Jason
Eckertand a myriad of other students
can personally attest to. SGA is not a
“ﬁx it” institution by any means. We
are a vehicle of communication,
which will work with the students on
addressing and obtaining solutions to
their needs.

I am sorry that Mr. Kambour-
oglou‘s individual needs were not
addressed, but maybe ifhe had made
the attempt, then SGA might have
been able to deliver. Do not justsiton
yourbuttsandbitchlikeKonstantinos,
come address your needs. Simply
complaining passively in your dorm
room and to your friends Will not get
you anywhere. We at SGA can‘thear
you until you come to us,

The scene was created by the use
of cinematic devices new to the
screcn. Director Griffith, realizing
that film must free itself from the
time and space limitations of the they
ater,had begun to fragmenthis scenes,
cuttingback and forthbctwcen scenes
and subjects. In so doing he was able
not only to compress and extend ac
tion, but to raise the level of tension
and suspense as well. The effects
achieved became Griffith’s and
Gish's trademarks.

“The Rescue" scene takes place
on the frozen riverjust as it begins to
break up, and Miss Gish, as Anna,
moves toward the falls. Anna is colr
lapsed on the ice as her lover, David,
is running along the bank Lrying des—
perately to catch up to her before she
is swept to her doom. While Griffith
cross-cuts back and forth between
them, David jumps onto the ice, but
stumbles to his knees as the cross-cut
shows Anna at the brink of the falls.
However, he recovers to snatch her
justas the ice floe goes over the edge.
Holding Anna, he struggles to main-
tain his balance on the slippery floe.
Finally, he is able to make his way to
solid ground.

Ananalystsby MacMiIlenFilms
says: ”This sequence, which many
consider one of the most vivtd and
exciting in the whole history of the
cinema, is all the more remarkable
because the action it presents never,
in fact, took place. What we cxperi~
ence through Director Griffith’s pre
sentation of a highly dramatic action
occurring in integratedtimeand space
is, in reality, a series of ingeniously
edited pieces joined together to crcr
ate a tilmic space that docs not exist
in reality. Thejuxtaposnion of shots
of Anna being swept by the current,
with shots of the ominous falls, sets
up such strong emotion in viewers,
who had never seen such action on
the screen, that the scene has re-
mained high on the list of inspired
film illusion.”

Unfortunately, Griffith’s new
techniques did not spare Miss Gish
the agonies of spending several dttys
in the icy water while the scene was
shot. and she developed a mild case
of pneumonia. Obviously the experi-
ence did not deter her from pursuing
her film career. Her last picture was
The Whale: ofAugust in 1987, with
Bette Davis. However, she was aer
tive untilhcrdeath,and wascxpected
to play a role on Broadway in what
would have been her one-hundredth
year. As the most prominent and the
last living interpreter of Griffith’s
work, she was in demand for inter
viewsby television and by film histor
rtans. She lived independently in her
New York City apartment, where she
died in her sleep on February 28th.

 

Potential Student Initiative
Disrespectful of Minority

LITTLE bird told me the other day Lhat an
A initiative is being planned for this spring.

The wording would be to the effect of“We
the students of Grinnell College believe that it IS a
woman’s right to choose.” It is something which has
been done before (one occasionally sees someone
walking around campus with those words written on
the back of their shirt), and apparently some people on
this campus think it needs to be done again. I would
like to encourage everyone not to sign any petition
proposing the initiLiave and to
not vote for it ifit is held. I ask
this not out of any personal
opinion regarding abortion
rights. rather as an appeal to
your common sense.

Any initiative which
makes a blanket characteriza-
tion of Grinncll College and/or its students is unfair
and necessarily inaccurate. I realize fully that a high
percentage of Grinncll students do believe that it is a
woman’s right to choose. However, there are many
students here who, while they may believe strongly in
personal freedom, privacy, and women's equality,
also believe that there are greater issues at stake. To
casually disregard their sentiment is antirdemocratic
and illiberal, The protection of the interests and
wishes of the minority against the dominant and
eradicating tendenciesofthe majority isa central part
of our conception of democracy and pluralism. We

Alla/t
aria/7M4

should not forget that in an attempt to gain solidarity
over an issue.

Ask yourself this. would you accept an initiative
which stated that “We the students of Grinnell Cole
lege are straight.” Of course you wouldn’t. Why‘.7
Because that initiative would be wrong. It would
unfairly occlude a signiﬁcant (yet small) part of the
student body. It would create a feeling of hostility
between the labeling and labeled group. You will see
quickly the multitude of devious possib ties: “We
the studentsofGrinnell Col-
lege arewhite." or. “Ameri-
cans," or, “not handi-
capped." Just because a
characterization is generally
true does not excuse it.

If you are thinking about
working to make this initiar
tive happen, please reconsider. If you are asked to
sign a petition to have the initiative, please say no. If
the initiative is held, please vote no. In my personal
experiences I find that many Gn'nnell students are too
quick to not listen to another’s views. They think that
they have it all figured out and don’t need to hear the
counterpoint. Letting this initiative die could be the
first step in this campus being more intellectually
honest. Have the courage to not jump on the illiberal
bandwagon. Have the honesty to realize that people
have opinions different than your own. And have the
decency to respect the feelings of the minority.

 

 

 

Even with New
Peace, Pain Lingers

6‘ LL victory ends in the defeat of death.
‘1 8 That's sure. But does defeat end in the
victory of death? That's what I wonder."
These words of Eugene O‘Neill aptly describe the
mood of Grinncll, as we look helplessly on when two
of our dearest daughters pass away, just when we are
about to mark one hundred and fifty years of our
existence and farne.

Most of us returned to school exuberant and
ebullient after enjoying a relaxing vacation and the
brightness ofsuinmer. Butno sooner had wequenched
our thirst from the incessant summer heat when our
high spiritswererebufferlwith
thencwsofTammy Zywicki’s
abduction. Our worst fears
weresoonconfirmcd1Tarnmy
had been brutally murdered
by her kidnapper. And before
our wounds could heal after
the Tammy tragedy, our hearts were again bruised by
the departure of another dear sister, Amelia Miller:
two fateful losses in less thana year. That would be too
painful for even the most stoic hearts to bear.

Painful though these tragedies have been, Grinnell
has met them with courage and dignity. The trauma,
which has been eased by support groups and counselr
ling. has permitted us to undergo some therapeutic
introspection as a college and a community. The depar-
tures of Tammyand Ameliapulled the campus together:
the dawn candlelight vigil was memorable, and the

WAD/V/fW/V/E/Dfﬁfﬁfﬂf/Vf

emotional church services held in their honor were
historic. These occasions were rare moments that saw
our souls and spirits knit together in unity in mounting
of two loved ones. It is ironic that the very pain that
opened new wounds is healing old wounds.

It is commendable that we have been able to
move past our sense of melancholy to a new sense of
oneness. TheZywicki family faces are familiar on our
campus now; the warm reception accorded them was
laudable. In spirit, they are now pan of the Grinnell
community. And after Amelia‘s death, students have
acknowledged a greater need to be more supportive
of each other.
In fact, some
have openly
c o n f e s s e d
that the two
i n c i d e n ts
have totally
changed their personal lives; they are more ready
now to let go of old giudgcs, and embrace new
friendships.

Despite the newfound peace, the pain-though
fast healingistill lingers. People are still shocked
and stunned: they feel thatthey have been robbed and
that an irreparable damage has been inflictedon them.
But they take cotnfort in one thing: the new peace.
Although the wounds might never completely heal,
the new peace gives us a chance to look ahead and
build a new Grinnell.
