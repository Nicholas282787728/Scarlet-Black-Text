On Wednesday everyone on

was actually something in their mail
boxes. Then we all pulled out the
schedule ofcourses for next semester
and thought “Oh, it's that time
again " As you are worrying about
papers and trying to choose classes
for next year, think about taking up
a new activity If you turn to the
Physical Education section of the
course schedule you will find that
there are aliasi of acriViries offered at
the PFC that are great {or some time
away from the usual Grimell grind.

About 125 students participate
in activities classes at the PEG every
semester. These activities range from
aerobics to rock climbing. Andy
Hamilton, a Grinneli Alum who is
now a member oithe Physical Edu-
cation Depattment faculty, says that
these classes offer students an opporr
tunity to explore a potential lifelong
activity that they can truly enjoy. If

an indiVidual can get into the habit
of participating in a sport such as
racquetball, they Will be better able
to stay healthy throughout their life.

To promote physical well—being
and the en] oymenr of sporting actiw
ities, classes are not confined to peo—
ple who possess great sktlior physical
fitness in the activity. These classes
are meant to help the student to
progress at their own level and hupc»
fully to enjoy what they are doing.

CoachTimHollibaughsaysthat
when he is leading a racquetball or
conditioning class he needs to know
what the student is expecting from
the activity, so that he can individu»
aIize the program to help the student
progress during the semester. In men
querball for instance, Hollibaugh
gives the class a general lesson on
how to play the game and then gives
indiyidual instniction to each play—
er. He concludes the class by split
ring up the players to practice with
classmates who have similar skill lev—

ing an aerobics course at Grinncll
since the early 1980’s This class was
originally for a loyal group of faculty
and staff, but was later added as a
biweekly activity forstudents. While

the size of Freeman’s classes have
varied over the years, this semester
the aerobics class is packed with about
thirty students. Freeman uses a vorir
ety of techniques and equipment in
order to keep the class interesting
and beneficial. one approach Free—
man says she likes to use is to shock
student’s systems, since for the body
to be healthy it needs to be able to
adjust to different stresses. Many
people who have taken the class de—

The most popular activities class
by far is bowling. Every year many
students are turned away because the
class fills quickly. Hamilton says that
itisdifﬂcult to instruct forty students
in a bowling alley, so he attempts to
give the students suggestions for im»
provement and does not try to force
any one technique upon them.

ing class because he gets to meet and
