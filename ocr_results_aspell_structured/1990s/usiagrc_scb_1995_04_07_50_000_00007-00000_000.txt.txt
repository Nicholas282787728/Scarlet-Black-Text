UESDAY afternoon was
freezing, but thatdrdn'tstop

I Grinnellians from turning
out to support the baseball team. As
fans looked on, the Pioneers began
their conference schedule with a
doubleheader against Cornell. The
Grinnelllans lost the first game 773,
but came back to claim a narrow
victory in the second contest, 13712.

The Pioneers' win brought their
reeord to 4713, Unlike the 15 games
played in Florida, these games were
the ﬁrst of the season against Midv
west Conference foes, so the team‘s
conference record stands at H.

The ﬁrst game of the afternoon
began as adefensivc battle. After the
ﬁrst three innings both teams were
scoreless, In the fourth inning, how-
ever, Cornell earned its ﬁrst points
with backdobaek home runs. Grin»
nell was forced to play catehrup as

runs with one man one base in both the
sixthandseventhinnings,bringingthe
score to seven.

The Pioneers launched a come-
back in the seventh inning, Junior
Michael l-luni a drove in a run with a
hit to right ﬁeld, and the team scored
twice more on a pair of wild pitches.
However, the onslaught came too late
in the game, as the inning ended on a
stnkeoutand the Rams got the victory.

Despite the score, players saw

After two innings, with ﬁre score

Team members praised the clutch

“He threw strikes when he needed

Coach Lori Sadewaier is hopeful
that her team will be compedtive this
week but the chances hinge on two bro-
ken ﬁngers. Both ofGrinnell’s pitchers,
Catherine Brown ‘97 and Vickie
Drake’98, sustained ﬁaemres during a
spring break trip.

“Atthispointldon'tknowwhoean
play or pitch," Sadewater said.

In Flon'da the Pioneers struggled to
a 176 tnark but Sadewater was upbeat
about the effort.

“We hit the ball better Lhan we have
in the pastand we playedbclterdefense,"
she said.

Last season the Pioneers averaged

conference

aboutthreeenors perinning. Onthetrip
they kept the mistakes down to threeper
game, an improvement which pleased
Sadewaler.

In a 13-3 victory over Pikeville,
Grinnell held the lead the entire game.
The offense was sparked by leadoff
hitter Katie Elliott '97 who was three

Waldron ‘96 notehed three RBIs on a
single, walk and fielder’s choice.
Anotherhighlight came when the team
