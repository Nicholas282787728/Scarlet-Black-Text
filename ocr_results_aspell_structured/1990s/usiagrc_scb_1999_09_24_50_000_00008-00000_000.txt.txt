lrheaury is rrurh and rrurh heaury, as Keats
said, ir is heauriiui rhar rhree crinneii Col
lege sporrs reams made rhe fourshour drive
ro Eclolt rhrs week and iusr demoralized rhe
Bucs.Thc rrurh is rhar rl'lclr eheeksarewhirer
and eyes a lirrie less lively this week. But I’m
no Kears.

i was an Beioir rhis week rhougn, so I’ll rry
in do Justice ro rhe rollowmg.

During roorhall praeriee, one or Belcit’s
reeeivers eaughr a pass and just burned rhe
defensive back. After whieh, he reir ir neces—
sary ro say, “You herrer play herrer rhan rhar.
We gor beat lasr week because you and rhe
rest orrhe defense played like sh*#!”

At rhis pomr (llc defender, who musr be
rhe foremostauthurity in rhespeeialiaed ﬁeld
orrarionalizarion by now, said, “Oh, yeah!"
wirh about rhe same digniry as someone who
has .usr been rarred and rearhered. But he
didn't ger ro ﬁnish heeause a eoaeh had‘ ro
srep oerween rhe two.

The reason ror rhis argumenr isrhe fact rhar
Grinnell walked inro Beloir and humiliared
rhc Bucs 28-20, coming from behind on rhree
Troy Daugherty rouehdowns in rhe seeond
halrand a couple orJoe Hansen inrereeprians
in the rourrh quarter as win rhe game.

But ir gers worse. The lasr rimc rwo schools
were rhis uneven, Plessy v, Ferguson was srill
in erreer. Both soeeer reams also rravelled ro
Beloir this weekend and pulled orrvierories,
bringing ahour a rrireera for reams rhar wenr
to Wisconsin.

The men’s soeeor ream, pieked ro ﬁnish in
a dead Heart for fourrh place in rhe confers
enee, wenr and hear rlie Bucs, preseason con-
ferenee ravarires, 2.1 on an overrime goal by
rhe surertoorud ﬁrstvycar John Wray. Here’s
what happenned righr herore:

caprain Joel Felkey: John, do you wanna
rake .r.>

Wray: Um. . .sure.

Fclkey: John, are you gonna ro make it?

Wray: Um, yeah. oh yeah.

And he did, slorring it inro rhe lower left
corner pasr Eeloir’s All—Conference keeper.

Earlier rhar week, rhe women also made rhe
rrip. heating Beloit l.o on an early goal and
simply nor allowing rhem ro seoro tor the rest
or rhe game. The ream is now undereared
and unseored.upon in conference. They are
rhe‘renm ro hear.

so are rhe men, so is rhe roorhall ream. And,
arrer this weekend, rheir eyes should he even
more lively.
