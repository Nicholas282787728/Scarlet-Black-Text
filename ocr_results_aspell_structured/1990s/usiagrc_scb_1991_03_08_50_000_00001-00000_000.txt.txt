Computer Services halts
use of quote board

By Craig Wacker

Two popular programs have
recently been discontinued in
compliance with computer services
policies. Prof Quotes and Poll of
the Day aroused greatconccm over
several questional practices, said
Director of Computer Services
William Francis. These, accord-
ingtoFrancis,arcthconlyprograms
that have been discontinued re-
cently. Francis said that there had
been no effort by Computer
Services “to turn over every stone."

Francis cited several reasons
why the two quote boards had
been discontinued. In reference to
the Prof Quotes board,Francis said
that the program was run off ofan
individual's account. In addition.

Francis said, the student was no
longer a student at Grinnell Col-

dangerous."

The Poll of the Day,according
to Francis, was also run out of an
individual’s account. The recent
advertisementin the weekly memo
brought the board to the attention
ofFrancis. The danger of running
programs out of the accounts of
individuals, said Francis, is that it
aides a variety of unethical com-
puter programs to wreak havoc on
the system.

A program that Francis called a
“Trojan Horse" program is one
which gets the user to give their
