For the people on ilie cnd ofthese

Business spent over 300 bil—

enlisted the entire mainstream

labor spent 30 billion dollars to
defeat NAFTA, yet the mainstream
press whined unceasingly about in—
bot’s strongatm tactics, and called

Noam Chomsky and Ralph Nader

press has been so totally coopted
could such mendacity pass as fact.
Since NAFTA passed, thousands
of jobs have. flown south to the
maquiladora plants, where labor
and environmental considerations
are Virtually non-existent. Over
60% of maquilzidora workers are
women, and they work without
health benefits, the ability to union»
