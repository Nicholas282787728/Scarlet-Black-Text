Chamber Music

BY MIKE DZIEGI'ELEWSKI

At eight o’clock tonight at Herrick
Chapel, the Grinnell College Cham-
ber Ensembles will be performing
selections from the compositions of
Antonin Dvorak and Joseph Haydn,
with a reception catered by Cafe’
Phoenix afterwards.

The ﬁrst piece, Haydn’s String
Quartet Opus 50, No.1, will be
played by violinists Sarah Morsbach
and Hannah Mundahl, violist Ted
Smith, and cellist Holli
Hoerschelman. Composing well
before Bartok and Beethoven. Haydn
invented and popularized the String
quartet, known for its great balance
and sense ofconversation. The Opus
50 is one of his earlier quartets, res
markable for its use of simple build
ing blocks developed using different
and complex techniques.

The “American" by Dvorak,
String Quartet 0p. 96, has a special
significance to Iowans, particularly
the Czech community of Spillville.
Himselszechoslovakian. While vis—
iting in the summer 0f1893, Dvorak
composed this piece on the banks of
the Turkey River. The piece will be
performed by violinists Melissa Rob-
erts and Sarah Fowles, violist Katie

Russell, and cellist Cody Robertson,
Inspired by the countryside,
Dvorak‘s themes borrow from folk
spirituals, native American music,
and even the song of the scarlet lana-
ger,

The third piece, also by Joseph
Haydn, is perhaps his most famous
piano trio. the “Gypsy." i-iob. xv:
No. 25. Although Haydn is from
Vienna, he spent much or his time
writing for the royal court In Hun—
gary. The “Gypsy” is inﬂuenced by
the mystical song and dance of the
nomadic eastern European peoples,
Performing the “Gypsy" are pianist
Christine Wu, cellist Charles
Marshall, and artistic director Nancy
Gaub. who will be taking violinist
Mary Ella Orsburn’s place. Orsburn
broke her arm in an accident last
weekend, She and the Chamber En»
sembles have been practicing and
preparing for this performance since
early September,

Mrs. Gaub, teacher of the violin
and viola. guide and director of the
Chamber Ensembles, is a lecturer in
music and performs in the college
faculty Chamber Music Series She
is also co»artistic director of the
Roycroft Chamber Music Festival in
East Aurora, New York.

Jeremy goes to the

movies: the revenge

“The Movie Man” Tolbert loves
Grosse, regrets renting Park

”I killed the president orParaguay
with a fork. how have you been?"
With lines like this, how can you not
love the movie? In both an amazing
cop-out and adoration for Gross
Pointe Blank, it is the only film that
I‘m reviewing this week.

The story of this film is quirkicr
than a mathematics major. You have
a seemingly standard character, Mare
tin Blank (JohnCusack), Martin is
a hitman", a loner in the wo'rld‘o' ired
killers, and lately he's had a bad
string ofluck with work. People are
a little annoyed when he kills them,
and he doesn’t understand. He's
been seeing a psychologist played by
Alan Arkin, who is terriﬁed of him
because of his line of work, At pretty
much the same time in his life, he
receives an invitation to his tenth
high school reunion. Then he gets
pressured by Dan Ackroyd (who
plays Grocer, another hitman) into
joining a union (which to me sounds
like something straight out of The
Simpsons). Grocer is annoyed be
cause lately
assassins are
g e t t i n g
booked to the
samejobs and
it‘s embar-
rassing to all
panics. Blank
takes ajob in
Gross Pointe.
Michigan. his
hometown. to
appease a
boss whose
job he had botched earlier. At the
same time. he is to go to the reunion
because his secretary is on his case.

Martin hasn‘t been home for ten
years since he disappeared, and
people are a little surprised to see
him, With National Security agents
out to arrest him, fellow members of
the profession out to gut him, and an
err-girlfriend he’s been having bad
dreams about since he abandoned her
on prom night, Blank has to keep his
cool until he can get his Job done,
get through the reunion. and win the
girl back (Minnie Driver).

What type of movie would you
classify this as? Action? Not really.
It's more of a dark comedy, The
film's subject and plot seem. by my
description. to be quite serious, but
in a way that is very surreal and hysr
terical. What adds a lot to it is the
standard sort of deadpan humor that
John Cusack delivers his lines with,
just like in the old days with One
Crazy Summer and Better aﬁDead
All of the characters are ones we've
seen in more serious movies, but they
have such an air of humor about them
that it’s hard to take it seriously.
Sometimes the scenes cross that
boundary between drama and come

The ﬁlm’s subject and
plot seem, by my
description, to be quite

and hysterical.

edy, and it occasionallykwill leave
you a little confused. But I enjoy
that, as you all know. Another face
tor in the humor is the secretary
played by Joan Cusack. She goes
from talking with amercenary about
a missing shipment of bullets to the
recipe for soup. 1 cracked up during
just about every scene she was in.
The surreal quality comes from the
fact that every time someone asks

Blank where he has been'for the last ‘

ten years, he‘s honest, and not a
single person believes him.

Another amazing aspect of the
film is that the violence is almost
TarantinOresque. We demand vio
lence in afilm about an assassin, and
we get itby the tmckload here, lsort
ofenjoy it. and it makes a nice clash
With the scenes of humor about vior
lence. It shows you that the film rcr
ally is serious, and killing is not a
funny thing,evcn ifBlank doesn't get
that.

Ilovedjustabout everything about
the ﬁlm. but I really have to tell you,
I like John
Cusack. a
lot. Igrew
up on his
cheesy 805
films. so I
may be bi-
ased, but if
you have a
really sick
and twisted
sense of hue
morlike this
r e v i e w e r
does,1betyou’llbelaughing. Igive

. this movie fourout of four dead Para»

guayan presrdents with forks in their
throats. I told you. I have a sick and
twisted sense of humor.

Well, Ijust noticed that this isn't
quite long enough so I thought I'd
rant a little bit about a film that I
rented recently. Almosteveryonc on
the planet has seen this film, so I
won‘t really go into thc speciﬁcs.
The Lox! World had plot holes big
enough for aT. Rex to walk through.
Some ofyou know that I’m a big fan
of computer animation. and am gar
ing to hopefully teach an ExCo class
on the Subjecl next semester, but I
have decided that even the best anir
matron can't cover for a worthless
p101, Istarted keeping score for the
dinosaurs They got something
around 15 or 16 points, I think the
only reason the second team landed
on the island was so that tlle film
would have more fodder for the rap-
tors. My favorite shots involved rap»
tors leaping on people, This nlljusl
fits in with the theme for the week:
violence that makes me laugh. lgivc

“... We both have

it's the stink ofdesperation. But I’m
working on it. No one spends more
time thinking this ihing out than I
do .. .

This brings up one of the show's
fundamental issues, something Brian
has coined as “Lehr's Paradox."

“Brian's theory is (and he‘s an
expert on the an of not getting any)
that sex IS like air. You only miss it
when you don't have it, And then
you think about it all the time. Yet
those who have it in abundance don't
think of It at all." said Max.

"It‘s true," Brian replied. “If you
have it, it
doesn’t bother
you. You don’t
have to say
you’re a mack.
You are!"

The show
hinges on
“Lehr’s Paras
dox,”

Max

“Max is alot
like that guy
Silent Bob
from Clerks."
said Lehr, “At
least in the beginning. He’d say very
little but then say somethingjust per-
fectly. For example, there was that
onetime a few weeks ago I was talk
ing about the Whole ‘sexiled' issue,
which I think the school has in re-
verse, and I was getting really
worked up, I think I was going off
on some diatribe about how those
‘sexile' rooms over in Younker
should have parking meters or those
things on airplane bathroom doors
which slrdc over and say ‘occupied’
when Max pulled up on to the mic
and said ‘In this world there are
people who get some and people who
don’t, and the world favors the
people who do,‘ So I of course

‘ started crying, and Max prepped a

CD andjustsaid ‘Brian hasjust been
talking forever, full of sound and
tiny, signifying nothing. I’m just
going to play this thing and get the
hell out of here.’ “

“Talk about a tale told by an idiot,"
interjected Brezezinski.

“For the first few shows, it was
like I was playing off a mime," ex-
plained Lehr “Max would just sit
there blalikly or play with computer
before falling asleep on theturntable.
But ever since the guest mic started
functioning, he’s been talking more
often. I regict ever telling him it
worked."

The Show

“He’s [Brezezinski] got a lot of
angst. Some of that has to do with
notgetting his own show. He wanted
to do a Dylan and Beatles show. If
you know anything about Max, you
know he's a Dylan fanatic," said
Lehr. “But he’s on Deep Cutst"

“I think we both have our own
reasons for hosting the show, Ithink
we both have a message and we both
have agendas. I just have a better
cause than Max does "

“To get it, you have to listen," saitl
Cripe, who was also present for the
interview. “At first. I didn‘t think
Brian's show was going to amount
to anything. But now I’m convinced.
I listen every week or get a copy of
thetape. Ihavcto‘, They talk about
me and everyone else they know on
tllc air."
