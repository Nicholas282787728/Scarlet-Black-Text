Jeffrey Focuses
On Experience

What do you believe makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA president?

To begin with, one of the major
things aboutbeing SGApresidentis
to represent the student body rela»
live to all student-life policy, things
of that nature to the adminisuation,
the faculty, the town, community
organizations, and all the sort of
non-academic things.

This past semester. and this enr
tire year, I’m the Multicultural Af-
fairs Ofﬁce lntem, and work out of
the Student Affairs Ofﬁce. And
basically, what we do is we deal
with all the
p r o g r a m -

questions from them. Andsol have
not only a rapport with thelti. I have
experience giving these types of
presentations and actually dealing
with the trustees.

Like I‘ve said, I've also come in
contact with the alumni, in particu
lar, the President's Committee for a
StrongerMinoi-ity Presenceand. that,
we also dealt with several segments
of the faculty, faculty chairs,mathe-
matics, Ican recall in particular,just
some acting faculty, all the mem,
bers of theadministmtion—the presi-
dent, the executive v.p.— and.
alumni. And I’ve kept in contact
with alumni through Lhisofﬁceabout

ming that we
think would
bestaugment
thecampusin
terms of en
lightening all
of us to different perspectives and
the sort of things that would other-
wise be overlooked, We try to do
things that would be enlightening to
the campus, helpful, aiding. I’ve
been there, and I chair that, a com»
millec that‘s about twice the size of
the cabinet. Now, of course, we
have alesset jurisdiction. Very gen
erally, we have less things to do.
Some of the things that have come
out of that have been student to
treats. the peerrsystem program,
emerging minority program, and all
these things that I watch speciﬁ-
cally. I also, sitting as chair of that
committee, am the liaison for the
students, or for whoever else may
feel it necessary to get in contact
wim me, to get through to the people
at the StudentAffairs 0ffice,and,in
particular, the Multicullural Affairs
Office.

I’m also a member of the Presi-
dent’s Committee for a Stronger
Minority Presence, which I've ex—
pressed my commitment to the
school in giving them idws and
images of how students are existing
here at Grinnell's campus. I‘m giv-
ing them suggestionsas to how things
can better relate on the campus, and
what they can do from their posi-
tions and how the president, in par-
ticular,shouldbelookingforwardto
moving ahead in recruitment, in
terms of faculty and staff.

The reasons why I’m the best
candidate is I’ve had to relate with
the trustees as a member of the
Multicultural Coalition. We had to
give a sense, sort of a feel, of what
the campus was looking forward to
andwantingfrom them. To thatcn‘d,
I met with them first semester when
they got together for their dinner.
They were here for that weekend,
going to their assomd commlllocs
and such. We got there with about
fourolhcrstudentsand actuallygave
presentations to them about where
the campus was going. Cumcu-
larlyﬁwhatwe wanted andwhatwe
were looking forward to, very gen-
erally. And, of course, we ﬁelded

 

saying, “Who
would want to
comebackand
actually give
something to
the campus?".
keeping records of where some of
our alumni are, so that we can keep
in contact and have a place where
people can come in the Student
Affairs Ofﬁce and ask where some-
one may be, and what they may be
doing. I know the administration
well through low of different kinds
of committees and, then, also out-
side of formal gatherings. I‘ve had
to come in contact with President
Drake particularly, speaking to him
about Multicultural Coalition, and
about things of general interest to
the campus.

Also I'd like to stress that I’ve
orchestrated all-campus events,
which is different than not having
done it a lot. I mean I’ve structured
all-campus events. gotten the adver-
lisements together for those, gotten
the coordination together for those,
places for things to happen, things
like that, lthink,by allmeansJ’ve
got more titan enough experience
for the position. I think I've defi-
nitely got the know-how, how to go
on from here, and, likel said in my
statement, how to actualize theideas
and realize the ideas we have as a
student body.

 

What do you foresee as the most
important Issues faciugSGA and
what changes would you '

for SGA?

Truesdell Stresses Leadership

What do you believe makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA president?

I've been a student here for
three years; I‘ve witnessed just
about every aspect of Grinnell
College life. I don't think Lhcrc's
any substitute for actually being
here. lam or have been an SA, an
HAC, an SEPC member, an IM
coordinator. team captain, and on
various committees with the faculty
and administration.

I feel that it’s experiean like
these— where there‘s interaction
among people, where leadership
abilitiesaredemonstramdwhereone
has to be approachable, an adequate
communicator, open to ideas and
suggestions, where sometimes one
needs to take charge, one needs to
organize, where one needs to set
goals~whcreonc needs to be a good

president.

I don tfeel it matters how many
Joint Board meetings I' ve been to,
or how much ofan expert I am on

 

 

 

 

the nuances of parliamenlary proce-

'dure. I think if you're not a leader,

when people won't follow you. The
system can be learned, but you can‘t
learn to be a leader. Being a leader
is an inherent ability.

What do you foresee as the most
importantissues facing SGA,and
what changes would you initiate
for SGA?

Right now some of the most
important issues are, for example,
the deteriorating town gown rela»
tions Being my thirdyearhere,this

is by far the worst I’ve seen townr
gown relations. I think SGA, spe-
ciﬁcally the president needs to ad
dress this issue as quickly as pos-
sible, I think first of all, a speciﬁc
committee, whose sole purpose is
to address town-college relations
needs to be created. if one is not
already created. I think that SGA,
with this committee, could put forth
ideas which would improve these
deteriorating relations.

I think current activities. like the
toy drive and other CSC programs
are good forimprovingrclationswith
the adultand child population ofthe
town, but that's not the age group
that needs to be targeted. I believe

Ability, Knowledge, Drive

What do you believe makes you
the best qualiﬁed candidate for
SGA president?

First of all, I have more
experience in SGA than any of the
other candidates. I‘ve been altcndr
ing all the Joint Board meetings
since last year, when l was a fresh
man. By the end of this year, as l
stated in my statementofintent, 1‘“
have close to 40 meetings under
my belt. That has given me a pretty
good idea of the kind of issues that
SGA has to deal Willi effectively,
and who to contact. And I believe
that that’s really impoan

We need

 

really imagine any of the other
candidates really putting more ef-
fort into the job than I would. And

 

 

 

Lhat’sjustsimply the workethic that
I have. In do get elected president,
the students can be assured that I
will really be performing the job
well. It's somethingthatlhavebeen
interested in working towards for a
long time.

What do you foresee as the most

important issues facing SGA,

and whatchangeswould you initi-
ate for SGA?

Oneissue thall’m kind of con-
cemtxi with at the moment conr
cems the role of a senator in SGA.
Unfortunately. the role of senator
is, at best. anambiguous role, and

it’s not that clearly deﬁned. This
means thatthesenators can eitherbe
very good or poor. Part of thatstems
from the fact the role, again, is not
that clearly defined. and I’d really
