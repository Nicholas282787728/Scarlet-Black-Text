This is an exciting season. The
Pioneer's football team is in a posir
tion to have their ﬁrst winning sea—

forget those distant memories of their

Grinnell College’s fouretime
defending Midwest Conference
champion women‘s cross/Country
team is set to defend its crown this
year. “We have all ofour top scoring
people returning as well as increased
depth from a team which I consid—
ered to be the best in my 14—year
career at Grinnell,“ noted Coach
Evelyn Freeman. This Saturday the
team will travel to Cornell for the
Ram Run, a race that features a [\V0—
mile course rather than the usual 5k.

Teamwork and individual
skills will lead to improvement

Grinnell women's volleyball
coich Lori Sadewater has high things
to say of her team. “This is by far the
most outstanding group of volleyball
players l’ve worked with in my five
years at Grinnell," she said Wednes—
day.

Two of the major factors in that
analysis are juniors Liz Nowacki and
Kelly Louis, who were the team’s co»
Most Valuable Players last season.
Louis led the team in kills, digs, and
aces last fall. Nowacki was the team’s
leading passer last year and was secr
ond on the team in digs and kills. In
addition, both players are in the top
five for Grinnell women’s volleyball
season records in aces, digs, and kills.

Another major bastion of
strength for the Pioneers are its three
seniorco—captains,defensivespecial»
ist and outside setter Katy Kropf,
middle hitter Nancy Ostdiek, and
setter Allison Smith.

Finally, the team is rounded out
by seven first—years; Kelly Frailing,

in the early going. They lost a three.
outomye match to Warrburg Col—
lege on Tuesday night in fourgames.
Sadewater says that the team has
suffered from a lack of practice time
this yearbecausetheirschedulestartr
ed earlier than it ever has in the past
in order to ease the pressure on play—
ers during heavy academic periods at
Grinnell. “We haven’t been able to
spend as much time on individual
skills,"she said,becauscthe practices

have had to concentrate on getting
the basics of playing as a team down
in order to prepare for their earlier
games. The team has also had to
concentrate on team strategy because
of the high proportion of first—years.
who are not used to playing college»
level volleyball.

The team played their third game
of the season Thursday night against
Upper Iowa, and now have a much—
needed weekrlong break until next
Saturday, when they’ll play in a [our—
nament at Augustana College. Sade—

water plans to use the week to con
tinue the steady process of improver
mentshe’sseen in eachoftheirgames
this year. it’s important, she said,
that players “become more comfort—
able with each other, and learn their
teammates’ tendencies." She said
that asuccessfulseason is “a matter of
everything coming together quick—
1y."

The Pioneers’ next four match—
es are on the road. Their next home
match will be Saturday, September
30 at 1:00pm in Darby Gym.

“We have finished second behind
Wartburg and its nationally ranked
runners the last two years at the Ram
Run, so it will be interesting to see
where we are in contrast to them.“

“This year's team is even stron»

team now boasts a roster With 10 to
14 possible scorers. “Freshman

Following three grueling weeks

Last year, Grinnell snapped a two—
