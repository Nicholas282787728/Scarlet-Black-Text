THE REAL WORLD
Grinnell losers unite!

It‘s a complicated world out
there, and I’m beginning to realize
it isn’t so simple in here.

If anyone missed Eric Martin’s
"Top Ten Losers of Grinnell" list,
which was publicly accessible via
his VAX plan for six days. I'll be
glad to send you a copy of it. lust
tell [MORAN'L] on the VAX. The
highlighm include first years who
don'teven know whohe is, an SGA
president, most ofthe SCA, myself
and anyone who “calls me afriend".

Well, what do you know? I’m a
loser. In fact. a prestigious loser.
One of the top ten losers at this
college, for crying out loud. You
plow through 21 years of living.
and then one dayihangithc truth
comes out.

I thought no one realized all my
hidden loser traits: the way I
sometimes wear my shirts inside
out without realizing it, the way i
enjoy sappy movies like Breaking
Away. the way I secretly pick my
nose when I'm alone in the car. I
never knew that someone was
watching me funrvely luming over
those necessary cards in my solitaire
games.

I thought no one noticed my
sometimes ungrootned loser hair

But all this time, someone was

The ghost in the machine. How
much was he paying those spies?
I never realized that there was
more than just the universal
oversoul watching when I left the
water running too long while
brushing my teeth. Was he there,
hiding perhaps in the bathroom
cubicle, iotting down notes in ob-
scure shorthand psychohabble?
Was his tape recorder spinning
when I uttered those incessant
“Okleedokics” after those six con»
secutive shots of tequila? Was he

that it‘s Eric Martin‘s right as an

CURIOUSERAND CURIOUSER
A Question of peace?

The War.I am told, is over. The
time has come to bring the troops
home, embrace those who return
and mourn those who will not.
Questions, however, still linger.
Should we have fought? Was it
worth the deaths, both American
and Iraqi? As we watch the slaugh-
ter of the Kurds and the silence of
the world, did We really accomplish
anything? These questions are pro—
found. and it would he thehelghr of
arrogancetoattempttoanswer them
in this forum. I know how I feel
about some of these issues and am
still painfully torn on others. i will
be haunted by these questions and
the decisions I made as acitizen for
along time tocome, In this] am not
alone. How we go about answering
these questions, however, is as
important as the questions them-
selves.

Tomorrow a group of people
willattempt to answer someof them
in an All Iowa Peace Day. Their
goal is admirable. I cannot help,
however, but raise some questions.
Iamnotaitemptlng to passjudgment
on the conference or on the people
who planned it. What I would like
to do is point out that from what
I'vcsoenofiheplans fortheconrer-
once, it seems that it has answered
these questionscven before the first
speaker. It seems to me that the
important questions are being dis-

missed even before the discussion
begins.

The recent trend to simply say
War=Bad/Peace:Good ignores the
point and reduces the questions to
immature silliness. War is ugly,
and waris brutal; despite the impli-
cation ofthe conference' s title, even
the army thinks so. The question.
however, is when. if ever. IS war
necessary? While it is easy to say
that war is bad. it is not so easy to
say thatwars should neverbe fought.
While the modern Grinnellian is
attached to the notion that the only
opposite of war is peace, s/he ne-
glects the othermore profound his
torical truism: the opposite of war

The question of war itself will
not, however. so easily fade away.
It is one which has confronted our
nation before and will do so again.
Anyone can set up a straw argue

engage in real dialogue is far more
difficult. I. for one, hope that

COMMON SENSE
On 'Pride Week'

The observation of “Gay/Les-
bian Pride Week" manifests the
muddled thinking of the militant
homosexuals and “civil rights" ads
vocates of today, The organizers of
“Pride Week." like radical gays.
lesbians and ”civil rights" activists
arounrlthecountry,seemto believe
that they can enjoy equality and
special entitlements at the same
time.

It's fashionable these days to
attack prejudice against gays. or, to
use a more modish phrase,
“homophobia.” Homosexuals want
people to regard homosexuality as
something as natural and normal as
helerosexuality. Those who fail to
do so are often the target ofprotest
or legal actionirecall the disrupr
tion by members of ACT-UP of a
service in St. Patrick’s Cathedral in
protest of Cardinal O'Connor's
putatively anti-gay views, or the
rallics on our campuses against the
ROTC, which refuses to admit h0-
mosexuals.orlheincldenttn which

Commission [mod is sex-novelty
store in Manhattan 825,000 for

These are a few examples from a
list too long to include here.

Ifhomosexuality is no more nor
less natural than heterosex uahty, it
follows that homosexuals should
notviewlheirsexualltyasanymore
a source of“pride," as any more a
thing to celebrate. than heterosexu~
als do. It ts a truism that a group
cannot have equality and special
entitlements at the same time. But
homosexuality seems to be regarded
by its practitioners as a special dis-
tinction that ought to be honored.
exalted and celebrated. Hence “Gay
Pride Week” and its equivalents at
Kenyon, Reed, and sundry other
colleges. Hence the procession of
gaysandlesbians in theSt.Patrick’S
Day parade in New York City.
These simply have no heterosexual
equivalents. There is no week set
aside for the sole and explicit pur-
pose of venemting heterosexuallty;
there are never heterosexuals
marching simply as heterosexuals
in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.

in celebrations like “Pride Week."
in parades, in their conspicuous
display of pink triangles, they ex-
claim and exalt that difference.

The radical proponents of"civil
rights“ behave in a similarly con-
u-adictory fashion. The most egre~
gtous example is their support of
affirmative action. I would be hard
put to imagine a more racist and
condescending idea than affirma-
tive action, whose premise seems
to be that blacks are not capable of
helping themselves and advancing
socially,andittltereforctslefttous
to reach down and pull them up. As
I suggested in an earlier column
that seems to have been misinterr
pretcd by some, since amt-mauve

such as the breeding of racial has

forDuke;I think he should be locked
in a room and made to watch stock
footage from Buchenwald for flfly
hours. Butthere is leeitimacv in his
opposition to affirmative action.
whatever his ulterior purpose.

Since the heyday of the civil
rights movement in the 19605. the
deﬁnition of the term has grown
somewhat opaque. I used to think
that it meant equality for every
body before the law. Afﬁrmative
action having been instituted in the
name ofcivil rights, this definition
is no longer tenable, since Lhe
granting to one social group of le
gal rights that are denied to other
social groups is the most anti-
equalitarian policy I can think of.
I expect that this Column will, like
my other writings, occasion wild
accusations from thefar left, devoid
oflogic andinnocentoffact. But as

mire has noted. the people who
