Can’t stop

KATE LYONS
AND MATEO JURASIC
ARTS EDITORS

Due to a slight mix—up, this area
ofspace Will not contain the weekly
food review that later issues of the
paper will. The editorsapologize pro-
fusely for anydining inconveniences
this may cause you. but offer instead
our own views of the food world,
both on and off campus.

“I like meat. Mmm. Mmmin.
Good.” says a friend of the arts edi-
tors. Well, Iam Kate, eater ofchick—
en and hamburger substitutes and
girl who puts soy milk on Lucky
Charms, andI'llofferup to all ofyou
carnivores descriptions of pleasing
non/meat options.

To begin withmyfavorite, “Not.
Dogs" are a vegetarian option to hot«
dogs, a food that doesn't really re.
semble dogs, well, except for Dachs—
hunds. “Not. Dogs” are a purely veg—
etable product, and since they’re
shorter than the average hot<dog,
theyfitbetterintheaveragesize bun.
There do exist other brands of hot—
clog substitutes. "Tofml’ups" are an—
other type that I have tasted, but do
not enjoy. “Not—Dogs" can easily be
browned in a frying pan with a small
amount ofwaterat the bottom ofthe
pan. I have found that when “Tofu—
Pups" are cooked in this manner,

eatin

they wind up with ery unappetizing
b isters on their surfaces,

Aside from pseudo hot—dogs,
meatless hamburgers, steaks, lunch
meats, chicken, non—dairy cheeses
and milks can also be found in select
supermarkets. And not to slight the
creativecookingofouannnellDlnr
ing Halls, a plethora of vegetarian
eating options are available right on
campus. The addition of meatless
chicken patty patmesan to chicken
patty parmesan night was received
by me ivith great pleasure. As 2. mat—
ter of fact, I ate two on Tuesday
night. And the salad bar option is
always available, for meals when the
vegetarian option may seem unzip»
pealing.

But enough about my eating
habits; on to those of my co«editor.
Mateo.

I am, as opposed to Kate, a meat
man. Raised on a steady diet of hot
dogs and butter, I quickly developed
a taste for flesh. In fact, I love meat
so much that I often try to convert
vegetarians by slipping bits of meat
into their soy burgers or tofu steaks.
Hehehehehe. Uh, but that’s beside
the point. What I’m here to talk
about is food. Ourwonderful dining
services provide a vast array of oral
pleasures to be indulged in every day,
three times a day. To summarize
them in 300 words or less would not
do them the juSUCe they deserve, so

instead 1 will discuss a much more
serious topic.

on Tuesday Aug. 29, a travesty
of justice occurred in the Quad Din—
ing Hall. As you all may recall.
Tuesday was the night that Quad
served our legendary Chicken Patty
Parmesan, the very same CPP that
has inspired the creation of movies,
songs, and even a newspaper article.
On this clay, to the horror of dozens
of devout Cl’I’ followers, someone
switched the parmesan cheese to
cheddarcheese. That’sright. We've
all been livmg a lie. Instead of din~
ing on the CPP we‘ve all grown to
know and love, we were served in-
stead CPC. Who can be behind this
nefariousploti Inquiringminds want
to know. One disgruntled diner
whose name has been changed to
protect the innocent, who we‘ll call
Adam \X/irtzfeldman, was so moved
by this incident that he exclaimed
“They must die‘ Torture will purify
their souls. No nice little decapita—
tions, they’ll all be drawn and quar—
teredl" Some of you may be com«
pelled to ask “What‘s the big deal?"
But for Adam \X/irtzfeldski, this is a
big deal. “Only white cheese goes on
Italian food. There is no yellow in
the Italian flag."

Okay, we realize that we are not
columnists, hence out positions as
editors, So, if you managed to read
this far, that tells us a lot about your
endurance for the inane and silly,
Hats off to you, gentle readers. Eat
well and prosper.

Movies on campus

TAYLOR “SUPERFLY” WYMAN
AND MATEO JU'RASIC

Star Trek Generations

Patrick Stewart and William
Shatner, the two sexrest men alive,
on screen at the same time. What
more can we say? For allyou Trekkies
out there, this one was better than
the first and fifth, very close in qual—
ity tothethitd. fourth, and sixth, but
vastly outclassed by the second. No
villain,evenifit is MalcolmMCDow—
ell from “The Clockwork Orange",
can ever rival Ricardo Mantelbahn
as Khan.

Low Down Dirty Shame

Shaft meets the 90's. This stock
”angst—ridden ex—cop gets the women
while dukin' it out with bad ass Co—
lombian drug lord and making wtse
cracks" plot hearkens back to golden
age of mid— eighties cop movies star—
ring MelGibson, when bad guys were
ugly and goodguys had big hair, This
movie is jam packed with enough
breaking glass,slow—mo gratuitous ass—
stompin’ fight scenes, and skimpy
lingerie to keep any (rat boy hootin’
and hollerin’. Two thumbs up.

Deccived

Saw it years ago and the memo
ries faded, but I am left With a warm
feeling when I recall this film. Golde
ie Hawn, as the blonde, seems like a
wise choice, The hood—winked wife
stalked by her husband plot may be
over used, but your time is for you to
squander. I (Mateo) on the other
hand, never watched it, but I still
think that watchinga movie is better
than engaging in disruptive free
[hu’lklngi so go, and I’ll see you
tliete. Half a thumb,

Blue

A Study ofMood.

Gut—wrenching pain, nails on
the chalkboard, soulless apathy, mind
piercing music, such sweet sorrow.
An amoral portrayal of emotion, with
spectacular shots and beautiful con—
trol.

Excellent... and very blue.

Counterpoint (Mateo): Ifound
this movie very... uh bad. It filled
me with an apathy I haven’t felt
since GoldenGirls was canceled. Of
course, Taylor keeps telling me that
that was the whole point. Hmmmm
