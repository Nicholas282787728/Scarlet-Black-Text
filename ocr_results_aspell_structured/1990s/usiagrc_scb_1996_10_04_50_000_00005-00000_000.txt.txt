Poet Philip Levine discusses his thoughts on poetry, work

‘What Work 13’ addresses author’s working-class upbringing in Fresno, CA

By LESLIE MADSEN
Arts Editor

Philip Levine. a 1995 VPulitzer
Prize winner and twice recipient of
the National Book Award, partici-
pated in a discussion led by Profes-
sor Edward Hirsch on Tuesday.

Much of the discussion centered
around Levine‘s ideas about work
and its relationship to poetry. One
of Levine’s books, titled What Work
[5, is dominated by poems about la-
bor.

Levine recalled that when he was
in college, it struck him that the per
etry to which he was being exposed
did not address working class cone
cerns, He sought to remedy the situr
aticn. “But getting to be adept
enough to [write poems about work]
took me so long it was ridiculous,"
Levine said.

When asked about the inspiration
for many of the poems in What Work
1:, Levine said, “It all came out of a
dream. I know that sounds a little
hokey. .. but it‘s true.“

Levine, who taught for several
years at the California State Univer-
sity at Fresno, explained that he was
living in Fresno in the fall of 1966—
a place Levine summed up as the
miserable ”Raisin Capital of the
World"—when he dreamed he re-
ceived acall from an old Friend, who
requested tips on what to see during
a visit to California,

Levine gave the friend a “travel—
ogue" of California, recommending
he travel. from San Diego to San
Francisco, following the coast. He
did not mention Fresno. Upon wak-
ing, Levine wondered Why he omit-
ted his hometown.

“I woke up wtth great anger to-
ward myself," Levme said. He said
to himself, “You're an assistant pro-
fessor" at a Secondrrate school, “You
live in a working class neighborhood
three hundred yards from the air-
port,.. Why didn’t you invite him
[(0 Fresno]? Is it because he’s a part
of your old life?"

It took Levine some time to realr
ize the phone call had been pan ofa
dream. Once he realized this, he re-'
interpreted the dream to mean that
he should not reject his old life. In—
spired, he began to address his work-
ing class past in verse. Levine stayed
in bed and wrote for ten days, callr
ing in sick, He said the poems that
came out of that week and a half‘s
effort were the first “good poems"
he had written on the industrial work
ing life.

The poems gained some attention,
Levine explained. People said, “‘Oh
look! That guy writes about workl'"
Upon publication of What Work [5,
Levine offered the book at a discount
to assure that it was ﬁnancially ace
cessible to working class people.
Much of the response generated by
the book came from such workers,

Levme said.

But industrial work has not occu-
pied Levine for decades. Now, he
labors at poetry and teaches creative
writing at New York University, He
has gained much recognition over the
last several years. Despite this,
Levine said he subscribes to core

.Vidal‘s and Norman Maller’s phir
losophy that writers can't be famous

because they don't have tlte face rec-
ognition’of rock and film stars. But
he does admit to some fame, “Just
the other day [at the gym] some guy
recognized me,“ Levine said. “It
turns out he was an English major."

Levine is patient with his poetry,
He isn’t afraid to loss aside bad po-
ems because they’re such a small
percentage ofhls work. “You really

have to grant yourself the freedom
to write badly,” he advised. I-Ic ad-
mitted that such a seemingly care-
free attitude toward poetry appalls
his graduate students at NYU.
Levine had some advice to offer
those interested in writing, He
warned against imitations. He said
he even imitates himse1f_too much
at times, and fears falling into a rut.

He wants each collection of poems
to be different enough that readers
will be pleasantly surprised to dis-
cover he is the author. He empha—
sized the rewards of disciplined
work; if one doesn’t sit down to
write every day, how can one ex-
pect to write successfully?

Levine said he managed to write
for several hours a day, seven days
a week, for twenty years of his life.
in keeping with this insistence on
distipline, Levine said, is his repu»
talion as the “bad cop" of the NYU

'creative Writing‘ program, He

gives his students rigorous assignr
merits that are extremely specific
in both form and content.

But, he claimed, the rewards of
such labor are great. When writ-
ing well, Levine said, “You’re
truly yourself. You’re wholly
yourself." He said interacting with
people inspires him and keeps him
feeling more alive. Between any
writer's subject and writing, he
said there is sometimes “a big lead
door and you can't get it open."
But Levine found a need to pry the
door open by addressing labor is-
sues,

“I think that industrial work
largely gives you nothing," Levine
said, because “communication
with your brother and sisters"
working alongside you is lost in
the noise,

This late—arriving letter to the Editor was moved here because of space limitations.

This letter is in response to Mr. Gotera’s letter of concern regarding "I'l'ie Ad—
ventures of Pleigh-Dough-Man". As the cartoons author, I would like to thankMr.
Gotera for expressing his concem in a genial mannerl applaud him for questioning
it rather than calling for its censorship.

I suspect that the episode to which Mr. Gotera‘s letter refers is the only
episode (of approximately 20) which he has seen, or at least thoroughly examined.
I sincerely hope that Mr. Gotera‘s concern stems from an unfamiliarity with the
cartoon and its characters rather than from whatI intended the cartoon to communi-
cate. I would greatly appreciate a chance to speak with Mr. Goteni at length about
the cartoon, but will attempt to address the issues with which he was concerned
with this letter.

First of all, the crescent shapes which form Pleigh-DoughrMan‘s “eyes" are
simply a stylistic convention I have used to demarcate the shadows formed by his
eyebrows. The character has no actual eyes, but rather two rounded indentations
with a large lip above them. When Pleigh-DoughrMan is illuminated from above
(die majority of the time) they appear as the crescent shaped shadows which Mr.
Gotera mistook for “stereotypical slanted eyes". There are panels in this week's
cartoon which should illustrate this better than last week's,

As to PleighrDough-Man's body shape, he is simply a blob of homogenous
chemicals that maintains roughly human forth. He was designed to appear some-
what obese for a variety of reasons. He is ﬁrst and foremost a parody of the comic
book superhero especially Batman as ponrayed by the noise—slender Adam West,
Also,l wanted Pleigh DoughrMan to break the stereotype ofdashing superhero and
action-hem characters with bodybuilder physique: in film and other media. Finally,
his affable bulk simply makes him cuter and more likable than an angular»bodied,
muscle-bound character. By sheetcoincidence only does Pleigh-DoughrMan’s body

bear a vague resemblance to those of Warner Oland and Sidney Toler (the original
Caucasian actors who played ﬁctional CliincseAmencan Detective Charlie Chan in
multiple ﬁlms in the thirties and forties).

I had PleighrDoughrMan use KungeFu in the episode in question for basically
two reasons: First, as a part or Pleigh-DoughrMan's ongoing parody of the super/
actionrhero genre of ﬁlm and comics, he, like Batman and James Bond, is an adept
practitioner ofa ridiculously large array of martial ans and other fighting skills. The
second reason for the use of Kung-Fu in that speciﬁc episode was in an attempt to
recreate the feel ofthe David Can‘adinc, JackleChan, and Bruce bee ﬁlms (of which
I am a tremendous fan) in a sequential art medium, which is inherently devoid of
motion. it was an experiment in stretching the limits of what comics are capable of
dotng.

The inclusion of‘NinjaAssassins" was in no way intended to insult or offend or
even pomay any Asian culture. PleighaDough-Man, and the Vasl majority of the
chamcters in ”The Advenlures of Pleigh-DoughrMan" are under SIX inches tall, they
are not even human, The Black Gerbil Ninja Assassin trolls were meant to parody
the “Ninja legions" so often sent forth to battle the lone protagonist in action ﬁlms
and comics if this was interpreted as deliberate, negative, misrepresentation for
hateful purposes, 1 sincerely apologize.

Although 1 strongly oppose censorship and believe in the artist's right to free
expression, I do feel that I have a responsihilily to avoid making the world a worse
place for any group of People If Mr. Gotcra or anyone else in the uncnviable but
necessary posnion cl’“wilncss and watchdog" ﬁnds thatl do sol will be more than
happy to make myself available for constructive discussion of my work and how it
relates to these issues

Thank you, Adam Wiancld ‘98
