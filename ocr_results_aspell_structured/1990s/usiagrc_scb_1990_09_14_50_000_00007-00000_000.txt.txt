LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Washburn Correct in
Assessment of Mandela

To the editor,

I was pleased to see a rational
voice in the Scarlet and Black
regarding the deiﬁcation of Nelson
Mandela. MikeWashbumiscorrect
in asserting that Mandela is not
even an admirablehuman being, let
alone a virtuous here. Media
generated mythology about
Mandela has grown to obscene
proportions in America.

The myth ttlat Mandela was a
politicalprisonerisnotevenshaken
by refutation from the premier
international human rights
organization In a letter to Human
Events dated June 19, 1985.
Amnesty lntemational stared that it
did not advocate the release of
Mandelabecauseitdidnotconsider
him aprisonerofconscience due to
his advocacy ofviolence. The cult
of worship that has grown around

’ Mandela, an admitted advocate of
terrorism and the Stalinist state
socialism practiced in Russia and
China in the early ﬁfties. should not
go unchallenged.

Mandela was not imprisoned by
thegovemmentoftheRSAbecause
he advocated the peaceful
dismantlement of apanheid. In
1961, as a leader of the ANC, he
founded, in cooperation with Joe
Slovo, the Secretary General of the
South African Communist Party.
theterroristorganizarionUmkhonto
we Sizwe. As head of Umkhonto,
Mandela is directly responsible for
the 193 terrorist attacks against
black police constables and
civilians, schools, Jewish
synagoguesandothertargetscanied
out by this organization between

1961 and 1963.

The 1964 conviction of
Mandela on charges of instigating
and funding sabotage was not
unjust. The July. I963 raid on the
Rivonia joint headquarters of
the ANC, SAC? and Umkhonto
revealed documents including
Mandela’s diary that conﬁrmed
that Mandela had actively
solicited arms, motley and military
training from the U.S.S.R., the
PRC, the G.D.R., Cuba and
various East European and African
governments, He intended to use
this aid in a campaign of
sabotageagainstloopredctennined
targets.

Furthermore Mandela himself
admitted in counthathe had planned
acts of violence and his defense
lawyer pleaded guilty on his behalf
to three of the four formal charges.
Mandela was not a political
prisoner, he was insteadaconvicted
terrorist.

Clearly the adulation this man
has received in this country and on
this campus is misguided He was
an organizer of murder and terror.
To glorify his actions in support of
tltese crimes is anti-humanitarian.
He should be received and treated
like any other released criminal.

Polarized Views Not
Answer to Whether
Mandela is Hero

To the editor.

It is unfortunate that Mike
Washbum’s world-view is just as
ridiculously polarized as that of the
liberals he condemns, He himself
seems to be guilty oflining up with
systems of oppression according to
their presumed position in the
obsolescent notion of a left-right
spectrum,

Nevertheless, Washburn is
correct in pointing out that Nelson
Mandela has made it quite clear
that he is no friend of Western
democracy. One can only wonder

at. the spectacle ofour nation giving
a hero’s welcome to a man who
despises our most cherished
democratic ideals.

The trouble is that we no longer
believe in the universality of our
ideals. We‘re so happy to sccThird
World countries throwing off the
evil legacy of Western colonialism
that we‘ve all but renounced the
possibility thatWestemCivilization
may actually have some positive.
active conu-ibutions to make to
humanity.

Mandela Criticism "Offensive";
Cause Should Be Supported

To the editor,

lamwritinginresponseioMike
Washbum’s article in the Sept. 7
Scarlet and Black entitled “The
ANC vs. Freedom."

1 had the wonderful opportunity
tohearNelsonandWinnieMandela
speak in Washington, DC lwas
also able to work peripherally with
the Nelson Mandela Reception
Committee. Pan of my job was
also to keep track of the Mandelas'
itinerary and activities while they
were in the US. I was able to learn
much about Mandela and the
struggleof the ANC in South Africa.
Because of this knowledge, I am
caused to question many of the
“facts” Mike presents in his article.

At a press conference, an ANC
representative to the U.S. gave a
responsetoaquestiontharwasvcry
similar to Washbum‘s statement

“Struggling for ‘freedom’ has long
served as a pretext for the terrorist
violence of Mandela‘s ANC.” I
hope l can do justice to the ANC
representative’sresponsehysaying
that the situation is seen by many
Black South Africans, and indeed
the ANC itself, as two different
“nations" in an armed struggle.

While you may not agree with war,
it is notiermtism,butitis similarro

As for this great fear of
communism that is evident in
Washbum’s article. my response is
that capitalism is not the only way,
and it is not necessarily the best
way. You may fear communism.
butnor everyone in the world does.
Communism is not synonymous

with human rights abuses. Please
let nations decide what form of
government is bestfor them. Nelson
Mandela is doing what he can to
free Black South Africa from
apanheid. Aﬁghtworth supporting.

Washbum‘s last paragraph is
probably the most offensive. First,
Mike should know that Nelson
Mandela is deputy director of the
ANC.notthedirector,afactldoubt
Washburn knew. Second,
Washburn shows his lack of
knowledge and research on the
subject in his discussion of Black-

the Zulu peoples. Many Zulu are

SGA President
Discusses Year

Greetings fellow Grinnellians.
As many of you know, I made a
campaign promise to write articles
in the Scarlet and Black every
couple of weeks to keep you
informed about what is going on
with SGA. Unfortunately, the SB
has been swamped with stories
lately, so this letter is a bit late.
Anyway, here it goes.

Many of you will be excited
to know (I’m sure) that I spent
a considerable amount of time this
summer, and during New Student
Days, creating a t abridged guide
to parliamentary procedure which
should be of great help to
new senators, not to mention
streamlining Joint Board
sessions.

This summer, I also flew to Des
Moines on several occassions for
meetings of the Presidential Search
Committee. Ofcourse, as with any
presidential search, theprocm must
remain conﬁdential to protect the
applicants, butlcan assure you that
there seem to be many exceptional
candidates out there looking to be
our next President; Grinnell is
clearly in a position to attract the
best.

As you know, a main concern of
mine recently has been the new
parking policy. Therewasan Open
Forum dealing Nill‘l theissueon the
ﬁrst day of classes. George Drake,
Waldo Walker and James Work
were on the panel. Needless to say.
students were not shy about
expressing concerns with the new
policy, and, hopefully, the
administration now has a better
understandingofwherethesnrdents
stand on the matter. Additionally,
the Committee on Student Life
(CSL) has convened twice so far in
order to draft a recommendation to
President Drake, which should be
sent very soon.

Also on the minds ofmany is the
new alcohol policy. An Open
Forum has been scheduled for Sept.
20 to deal with this. Members of

the sub-committee of CSL on-

Alcohol and Drug use, President
Drake and the College atlomeys
will be on the panel. I can pretty
much guaranlecali-‘erdiscussion.

This year's SGA handbook will

Pedro
Fernand ez-
McCarthy

be in your Post Office boxes
sometime soon (if you haven‘t
already received it). The books
have already been printed, but
starting next year, they will only be
distributedtonewstudentssenarors
and studentadvisors in order locut
down on paper waste.

I would like to slip in here that
tehre have been at least three
recorded incidents of homophobic
incidents on campus. I won‘tbother
getting into a pedantic lecture on
what asses the people responsible
are, because I fear that it would be
lost on them. However, I would
like to remind the parly(ies)
responsible that such actions
constituteharassmentatthiscollege
and could very easily culminate in
expulsion, ‘Nuff Said.

I would likeloend by reminding
you that SGA‘s very reason for
existing is ultimately to serve you7
both individually and collectively.
We're actually a piety good
resource, so don’t hesitate to come
to me, or any Cabinet member, it
you haveany questions, comments.
concerns or suggestions, Again,
that‘s what we‘re here for.

Contacting someone in SGA is
verysimple. Every Cabinetmember
is required to have at least four
office hours a week (our hours are
posted on the door to ihe SGA
offices, which are located in the
Forum, directly across from the
Student Affairs otrice), Simply
walk in and ask anyone there who
you should speak with. Also, you
can write to SGA through the VAX
by typing “th SGA." Finally.
you can call the President, Vice-
president or Treasurers at X4212
and every other Cabinet member at
X3316; the SGA ofﬁces have two
answering machines—if nobody is
there, just leave a message and
somebody will get back to you as
soon as possible. Have a pretty
good day.
