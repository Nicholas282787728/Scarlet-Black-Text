In fact, during practices. the
stopping time is never sell Its im-
portant to members that they are
willing to stop when it is time,
whether that means fifteen minutes
or two hours ofjamming, But the
timing is not arbitrary, it is based on

thought it would be a good way
to keep active in art while away
from school,

He sayshe wasrnoststrongly

Sometimes. if the groove is good,
the musicjust keeps on going.
“ltfeelssometimes,itlookslike
the music comes from nowhere. like
it is being pulled out of nowhere,”
said Barraza. “But what is really
happening is that we get a little
groove going and sometimes the
groove will start because I’m tap»
ping my foot, and I can't stop tape

ping my foot because the groove
exists. Or we end up screaming.
Sometimes it turns around, or sonic-
times itjust stays there, when we hit
the resonance." .
Often at these sessions. friends
of the band will stop in and listen or
even join on an instrument. The
band has a few regulars who often
slop by. During such scssions,incine

bers often exchange instruments,
each adding their owli dynamic.
Ifyou are curious about hearing
Smoke on Gout, they will be video
recording a practice next week,
which may at some point be shown
to students Kambouroglou defi-
nitely wants to make movies featur»
mg the music of Smoke Dn Gout.
The two members also plan to open

a jazz club called Duke’s Place,
sometime in the future. which will
be both a place to create and share
ntusic by guest musicians some
