Women’s Track Team at
Cornell Meet Tomorrow

M'PROVEMENT is the word around Grinnell College women’s

indoor track. The Pioneers will see how much improvement they

have made over last season this Saturday aLComell against compe-
tition from the South Division of the Midwest Conference.

Even though the Pioneers seemed to bemuch stronger, Coach Evelyn
Freeman wants her team to look beyond the early meets and focus on the
league meet in March. “We'll have more of our top runners competing
this weekend, it will be the first meet for tnost of them, though, so we do
not have expectations," commented Freeman.

Freeman saw some positive signs last weekend in a nOI'IVSCOHHg
affair hosted by Knox. Rookie Colbey Chang made a mark in her first
meet by placing fourth in the triplejump with a leap of 31'10". She also
placed ninth in the long jump at 14' 4". “Colbey did that well with no
technical training in practice,” said Freeman.

Because site was injured all last season, sophomore Rominitny
Chanthavong was competing in her first meet too, She ran a 0:34.75 in
the 200M hurdles which was good for eighth place and a l4th-place time
of 10.98 in the SSM hurdles.

Freeman’s distance crew racked up some solid efforts. Rookie
Stephanie Hitztaler produced the top performance, placing fourth in the
1000M in a time of'3:19.9. Jennifer Jacobson and Ally Eeekman placed
ninth and Illh in the 1500M with times of 5:24.93 and 5:27.34. In the
5000M Holly Pfitsch ran fifth in a time of 21:48.9, while Erin O'Fallon
placed ninth in 23:04.9. Freeman noted, “They ran solid, evcnrpttced
races."

in the relays the 4x800 unit ofShaune Foster. Bockman.lacobsen and
Hitztalcr placed fifth in a time “11:19.9. The 4x200 quartet of Chang,
