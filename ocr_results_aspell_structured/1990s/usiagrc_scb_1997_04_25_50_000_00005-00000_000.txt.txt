Queer Safe Zone
Dear Editor,

About three years ago, I was given
a piece of pink paper, on which was
drawn a triangle and the words
QUEER SAFE ZONE. Members of
the gay community on campus dis-
tributed these signs, and I began to
post one on my door in solidarity
With theln. Since then, the sign has
been torn off my door three times.
most recently this week. I can’t dc-
scribe what it’s like to approach my
ofﬁce in Steiner and see only pieces
of tape where that sign should be.

Once more, 1 will simply put up an-
other sign, but this time I want to
share a story with the campus com-
munity. Several months after I put
up the sign for the ﬁrst time, I got a
phone Call from an unidentiﬁed Grin-
nell resident who happened to be in
Steiner and saw the sign. This per-
son was gay and thought there was
no one that it was safe to tell in Grine
net]. The statement on my door was
seen as an afﬁrmation of Support, and
I was able to refer the Caller to GLBT
groups on campus. Because of that
one phone call, I have vowed to leave
QUEER SAFE ZONE on my door
at all times.

I hope I don’t have to replace the
Sign a fourth time.

Sincerely,
Sylvia Thorsoanmith

Blood Drive Response
To the Editor:

I am writing in response to the letr
ter entitled “Blood Drive Discrimi~
nation?“ in last week’s issue of the
S&B. The letter in question has a
legitimate point with whichI whole-
heartedly agree, Ibelieve Red Cross
should reevaluate its donor qualifi-

cation quiz so that homosexual males
practicing safe»sex may donate
bloodt At the same time, however, I

“While I respect

mosexuals, I also

—Naihaniel Rorl‘ ‘99

would hesitate to label Red Cross as
an organization unfit for Grinnell
College. While I respect the rights
of homosexuals. I also respect the
rights of other Students who are cur-
rently allowed to give blood. Most
importantly, I respect the rights of
those people who need blood, If
blood drives were banned on cam-
pus, would we really distinguish our
selves as a campus community bent
on social awareness? Or, rather,
would we distinguish ourselves as a
selfish lot ofindividuals unwilling to
aid the many people who have a dire
need for blood?

Nathaniel Rosi ‘99
It’s Fun To Litter!
To the Editor:

Tolerance, or the lack of it, is the
subject of many heated debates, but
I think students have lost sight of
how universally accepting this cam»
pus has been to so many individur
als. Individuals who , like myself,
are cruelly repressed by city ordir
nances, harsh ﬁnes, and public scorn
when we are not on campus. We
have found acceptance, and even

community at Grinncll College.

I am no longer afraid of persecu-
tion for declaring what I do; I litter,
and I’m proud of it. Yes, I know
where the garbage cans are located
on campus, they are everywhere, and
in plain sight, but I don't care. Ifch
society oppresscs me by expecting
me to carry my trash to a'receptacle

.where it will be handled properly. 1

throw my waste anywhere I feel like
I, my empty bottles and Cans, paper
and plastic, and fruit peels are all
over campus. (I know what you’re
thinking , paper and fruit peels are
biodegradable. is it really trash'.7 The
rot for quite sometime so I count it
as a valid display of rebellion to
throw them on the ground.)

Okay, so maybe campus is looking
trashy and nasty, so what',l I’m jot
the only litterbug: many. many
people litter, and even morcjust walk
past and let it lay. If people really
wanted a clean campus they’d carry
their trash to a waste basket and they
would pick up litter off the ground.
No, we don’t want a clean campus,
we've thrown offsociety’s Shackles!
The silent majority has spoken! Lit»
ter is acceptable! Litter on and libr
erate yourselves!

' ,

PS. This is satire, and I know it is
rare for it to be seen on campus, and
even more rare for it to be recognized
as such, Satire is a form of humor,
often employed to make political or
social commentary more biting and
memorable. I hope it has helped me
make my point.

Ask Iggy, emitted

freezer is usually stocked with those
Italian-American delights mostly
sought late at night (or even at mid-
day). But the problem is what to do
about this social deviant. At ﬁrst I
thought maybe this immoral charac-
ter was being affected by the multi»
tude of recent celestiaIIevents such
as the recent solar slorrn or comet
HalerBoppt But this pilfering had
been going on for two whole semes~
ters. Larger forces must be at work.
What do you suggest we do?

iDtstraught by Commu~

0k Communal,

Well, if you all moved out
then there would be no pizza to steal
right? There‘s always the old “lace
the pizza with laxatives“ trick or
maybe the old "lace the pizza with
arsenic" trick would vent your frusr
tration. Then again maybe you only
need to exorcise the demons from
your floor freezer.

Dear Iggy,

It has come to my attention that
you'll soon be strutting down the
aisle of graduation. Now, where does
that leave all of us helpless fools who
have grown dependent on your
shrewd advice'.l What sort of future
can we hope for? How will I pick my
classes next year? Will the S & B,
ﬁrst college newspaper west of the
Mississippi to print “Ask Iggy," con—
tinue publication? Should I transfer

Squares 0 Stella Than

before facing an Iggy-less Grinnell?
Oh you guys, ahhh....
Earl Grey

Hello Earl.

The answers are: hope-
lessly lost since the advice given is
so pertinent to daily life, a bleak fu-
ture is all any of us can ever expect,
random chance is always the best
way to choose classes, it is unknown
if the S & B will continue — but it
probably won’t since this column
ﬁlls over half the paper, and yes leave
now while you still have a chance
— no wait the answer to that last
question is no there are many ﬁne
information sources available. The
Time and Temperature line isn‘t leav-
ing is it?

nu

Dear Iggy.

What is your explanation
for the stigma of the second'line at
Quad (or Cowles)? Did Someone die
on it? Is itjust not cool enough for a
real Grinnellian'! Or do we just feel
the need to wait in line longer in
awareness of those who are op-
pressed under slow cafeteria sys»
terns?

-curious Quad denizen

Howdy Denizen.

I think the second line is a
foil to make us all forget that we re-
ally wpnted 3 pasta bar and it was
never implemented. A more impor-
tant Quad and Cowles related ques-
tion is: why are the croutons some—
times more crusty than other times?

Dear Iggy.

I am graduating in less than one
month, and I have no deﬁnite plans
yet for what I’ll be doing afterI leave
the hallowed halls of this ﬁne insti-
tution, Unfortunately, a lot of pesky
little underclassmen keep asking me,
“So! What are you doing after gradu-
ation ‘2’!" and it makes me want to
scream! I know it would be very
anti—social of me to beat these little
pip-squeaks senseless while scream-
ing "AAAAAAAHI-IHHHZ!!!!Z!!",
so I have refrained from doing so up
until this point. I don‘t think I’ll be
able to refrain for much longer, how—
ever, so I think I need to come up
with a pat lie to tell the people nosy
and thoughtless enough to keep bug«
ging me aboutmy future plans. Iwas
wondering if you could tell me what
kind of thing I should tell them?
Should I make it really exotic, or
should I tell them something realis-
tic, like I‘ve decided to join the cir-
cus2?

Sign me,
Almost homicidal

Hey Homicidal,

I think a the best answer to
this question is to punch the asker in
the mouth. This way they’ll think
twice before bugging you or any
other senior again. Seniors don‘t like
to squirm and no one wants to be
sucked in the mouth. See, it works
out great for everyone. Wouldn’t the
world be a better place if nobody
asked that question?
