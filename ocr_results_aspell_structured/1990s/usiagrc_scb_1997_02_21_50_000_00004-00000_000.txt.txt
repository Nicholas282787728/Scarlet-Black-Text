A day at the beach

BY SIERRA SOLEI'L
Columnist

It was a Tuesday afternoon, bright
and warm, and hundreds of students
with fluorescent runs were blinking
and rubbing their eyes, I went to sit
on the forum beach to read my plii-
losophy homework in the hopes that
the sun would burn away my persis-
tentﬂu like itdid the persistent snow.
I was surrounded by construction
noise and passing conversations, but
what really impressed me was the
wind—a breeze really. (No teeth in
a breeze.)

But as much as Ijusl wanted to stare
at the grounds newfound froedoin,l
had a task at hand. The book was
Mi_nd, and it was not quite as attraCr
tive as the scenery, but i dove in any
way. There were, of course, numerr
ous distractions all around, but I held
them off in favor of reasons why it
might be possible to compute emo-

tions using mental rcpresentations.
and the conflict between this and
dualism, etc. etc. etc.

It was all good, too, until I began to
notice a new din forming on the edge
ofmy awareness, This one was new.
and unusual, and rather high pitchcd.
That's probably why it carried so
fariall tile way past the ant farm of
construction workersifrom Steiner
to me. It being this warm ill Febru-
ary, I ﬁgured I was ready for any-
thing I could see on that sidewalk.
but i wasn‘t ready for what I saw.

It was a troop, or perhaps even a
legion, of tiny, bouncing, giggling
pre-schoolei's. It was crazy. like ﬁre—
crackers in a quiet park, or bright ribr
bons in a puddle. They, at least, were
fully appreciating the temperature
and sun,

But still I had to read, though the
words began to ring hollowly on a
head with a mind that was elsewhere:

cal underpinning: of emotion is com-

and were headed for me at a short-
legged run.

Up the ramps now, and around and
around! The sprites hopped and ca-
joled in a blur of galoshes and mite
tens-on-strings while I tried despera
ately to hang on to what Mr. Thagard

was telling me.

Hi kids. How was your week? I
know many of you have interesting
and insightful questions and con-
cerns so send them to [ASKIGGY]
or box 10-14 by next Tuesday and
I'll answer them free of charge.
What a deal! This weeks’ home ima
provement Lip has been preempted by
a heath and beauty tip from my Dad:
“lay off the booze and be sure to eat
lots of fresh fruit and veggies." Par-
ents are so wise.

You should send me a letter right
now. Itcould be something like this:

My Ask Iggy question is this:
Where do the worms go in winter?
Aren‘t they ﬂooded out with all this
melted snow? Aren't they very very
cold zit night? And in the daytime,
for that matter, since they are not
warm—blooded like some of us. I
hope you can answer these questions.
Thank you,
iProcrastinating in Burling

Dearest Procrastinaling,

Well, some worms hide under-
ground all winter long and get very
dirty. This is why you see them all
trying to bathe in puddles. Others

(yes I still want to graduate) Still
others hide in the walls of the resi-
dence halls and play with the heat so
that the temperature in the average
room is approximately a billion de-
grees.

Dear Iggy, .

I have long been a fan of your sage
wisdom. Thank SPARC it can now
be enjoyed outside of Quad! Since
you’ve shown yourselfin the past to
be an expert on roommate relations,
I now turn to you With my problem.

pus study program has placed me in
a flat with this neat freak sorority

pastimes include voting forBob Dole
and playing “I Never." During one
of our deeper conversations, she told
me about the new set of lyrics her
sisters at Alpha Chi have penned
about themselves to the tune of

“Baby Got Back.” Now, my ques-
tion is, should I try to learn the
words? Kim would take it as a nice
gesture, and once I return to Grin-
ncll, it would provide not only po»
tential cover material for my band,
but perhaps even something to dis-
cuss with I Tappa Keg at the next
Common Ground meeting. This is
surely an opportunity for good com-
edy, but might it damage my
selfhood?

Sign me,

Confused in Corrib Village

Howdy Corrib,

You picked the right person to ask
about selfhood. All my extensive,
inrdepth philosophical training over
the course of the past four years has
led me to this poignant, yet thought
provoking response: selthood
shmelfhood, (Whew, that
$80,000.00 sure wasn‘t wasted.)
However, any alternate lyrics to
“Baby Got Back" are typically in~
spired and every effort should be
made to learn and adore them. I‘m

sure Common Ground is eagerly
awaiting your retunl.

Dear Iggy:

As a vegan. I’m disgusted by last
week's letter by the so-called “de»
vour, just, Godefearing Flesh Eater.“
Those ﬂesh eatersjust think they can
pick and choose passages from the
Bible to prove their point that veg-
anism is immoral. Well, I did a little
research and found that the Bible also
condones the subservience of
women. In fact, quotes demanding
the submission of women outnum-
ber quotes demanding fleshreating
10:1! My question is this: Why don't
those darned ﬂesh eaters pick on the
patriarchy or the racial, economic,
and gender equalities lurking in the
Bible instead of us—the harmless,
loving vegansl!

7a TRULY enlightened vegan

Dear Veggie-head.

lfyou have the Bible behind you then
go for it. Wait, what was that? I
thought you wanted to start a vegans
for the submission of women group.
My mistake. (Hello, satire anyone?)

Whoever thought that one could
play a total of 11 pinball games off
only $2? Not Kurt Orzeck ‘00. ap»

Orzeck said. “The free games kept
on coming."

the machine,

Orzeck’s achievements on the
game came this past Wednesday at
approximately 12:30pm. His string
of games lasted until 1:15pm.
Orzeck's ﬁrstsuccess was a 14 mile
lion point game, which “granted"
him one free credit for breaking the
designated “replay“ score. Another
credit came when he was allowed
to enter his initials into the hall of
fame. Directly thereafter Orzeck
played four of his games at once.

million mark, winning him three
more free games. He then scored
another free game off his second to
last play.

Though Orzeck's scores are not
heralded as the best of all time, he
was quite pleased with the outcome.
“It's easily the best experience I've
had with the ma
chine and it wins
me backa few hun-

ter," commented
Orzeck.

But. alas, records

While the occa-

point game does occur, for the most
part scores below the 15 million
mark often change hands.

However. some records will prob»
ably remain. Matthew Freeman ‘00,
who also frequents the machin.
scored an astounding 23 million
points last week and Nathan Whiten

good," Whiten said. “Aladdin kicks
