tempt to refute critics. paiticularly'in Congress, of the
new agreement with Iraq. Neither Butler norAnnan menr
ironed Senate Republican leader Trent Lott by name but

day urged President Clinton to reject the pact, saying the
United States had abdicated its foreign policy to the
United Nations. Aniian went to Baghdad last weekend

doing enough to right drugs, but waived sanctions be-
cause they would hurt U.S. interests. “The Colombian

ducted an effective eradication and interdiction effort.
but the current government has notdemonstrated full pOA
litical support for counternarcotics efforts." Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright told a news conference. The
waiver means that sanctions barring economic aid and
U.S. support for loans to Colombia from multilateral in-
stitutions will not be applied.

Switzerland is accusing Israel of violating its sovereignty
after a suspected spy for the Israeli Mossad secret ser—
vice was arrested in Home in an alleged attempt to bug a
private house. A Swrss Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
said the country expected an apology for the incident,
which further tarnished the Mossad's reputation as a brur
tally efficient espionage machine less than six months
after the agency botched an assassination attempt in Jor-
dan. The ﬁasco chilled Close ties between the two coun-
tries but Israel’s ambassador to Switzerland said he was
convinced the matter would be settled.

lice say the men left suicide notes which said they were
unable to meet promissory notes to each other’s firms
and to banks.

Panel To Discuss Clinton Sex Scandal

Prominent Iowan speakers with a broad spectrum of ideologies to debate “Leaky American Ethics”

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

President Clinton’s most recent alleged
scandal will be the topic of‘“l-lc Said/She
Said:’A Prosecutor, The Press and a Presi»
dent— Leaky American Ethics” a panel dis
cussion presented by the Noun Program
in Women’s Studies alld Rosenfield Pubr
lic Affairs Program on Tuesday. March
3rd. The panel, which will be convening
at 7:00 in Science 1023, will discuss re»
cent stories about President Clinton’s al-
leged sexual relations with White House
Intern Monica Lewinsky, the conduct of
the press, the President's political allies,
enemies and the actions of independent
council Kenneth Starr in the matter.

Noun Program Director and Professor
of English Mary Lynn Broe helped a5r
semble the panel ofjournalists and law-
yers and hopes it will help clarify issues sur-
rounding the alleged White House scandal.

“We don’t have a lot of understanding
of the privacy rules, rights and responsir

bilities of either side," said Broc. “We
find ourselves confused by the colliding,
collapsing and intersecting ofissues deal;
ing wtth public and private life, issues
suchasblaming feminism and niisundeisuind-
ing the relationship of consensual sex, inf -
delity and sexual harassment and the press.”

Grinnell Alumni and CW” and crimi-
nal appeals attorney Jeffrey Garland ‘67i
who will be sitting on the panel, thinks
the discussion will be an educational exr
pericnce. “There are a lot of questions
about the issue and about the ethical Ice
gal and social ramifications of [this is
sue].” he said. "The panel members
should be helpful in providing furthcr une
derstanding on the events and putting
them in context."

Panel members will be addressing a
wide range of topics from a variety of
angles. “The beauty of this panel." said

Students respond to budget

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Many Grinnell College students are
concerned about this year's proposed 58.7
million dollar budget. The budget, which
has been approved by the Board ofTrustr
ees and will pay all of the colleges ex—
penses ranging from astronomy supplies
to zucchinis at Quad, is seen by some stu-
dents as inefﬁcient and inappropraitely al-
located. Others see it as effective and fair.

“I think there are a lot of little things
in the fine arts programs that could use
more spending" said Mark Houck ‘00.
“The electronic music program, for one.
They also need to furnish the ﬁne arts
building;it’savery beautifulbuilding, but
it needs furniture." Fellow sophomore
Sarah Hodges agreed,

“I think that’sjust a drop in the bucket.
I think science and athletics have all they
need right now. I see the construction as
a perfect example of spending on this
campus: get the science building done ﬁrst
and then work on ﬁne arts“

Many students said privately that they
were frustrated with the terms of music
lessons at Grinnell. “We have to pay atlr
ditionally for halfhour music lessons once
a week," said one anonymous junior.
“You think that a school with this much
money would be able to provide lessons
for students interested, but no. Look at

the team sports: the players get freejackr
ets. I’d like to know how much a letter
jacket costs,"

Not all students mind paying extra fees.
“Thirty five dollars isn't a lot of money"
says M.J. Matasar ‘01 of her sculpting
class. “We meet once a week for an hour
and have unlimited use of the studio.
Thirty ﬁve dollars covers materials and
classes. It‘s not so bad.”

This year, Grinnell athletics has re-
quested $l34.000 for mens’ and $95,000
for womens' athletic programs: a figure
that gives pause until one realizes that 268
men and 193 women participated in sports
this year. Thus $500 was spent per male
athlete, $492 per female athlete.

Erin Doyle is a junior and plays both
women‘s soccer and softball for Grinnell
College. In an email, site expressed her
concerns about the college's athletics rer
sources.

“The training filCIlltleS, as nice as they
are, could be improved." said Doyle. “Not
in a material sense, but the fact that there
is only one full-time trainer causes a lot
of problems, particularly in the fall sea»
sort. It is too much to ask of one person
to do everything that Grinnell requires of
a trainer. On top of this, the PEC itself
could use improvement. The facilities
available are insufficient to house every
one that uses the PEG at one time. The
women’s locker room in particular is too

multitude ol‘cltisses thatlthink would be

Broc doesn't only question press cow
ei-age of the scandal, but the motives bcr
hind those who have been providing that
information to the press as well. “Could
the deluge oflcaks do as much to advance
or derail an agenda on eithet side? Wlty
would Starr leak infoiination unless he‘s
looking for copy cat witnesses? And why
would the defense leak information un-
less thcy were hoping to deaden its illi-
pact later on? We have to have some infor-
mal talking and ill-depth drinking about that,

”We also have to examine the amount
of public money that is being spent to
pursue possible misstatements in a private
lawsuit at a time when we as a country
face critical decisions about both iiitei na-
tional and domestic affairs. We have Starr

Introspective Report
Analyzes Grinne l

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

A report assessing Grinnell College's
marketing strategies in retention and ad-
mission wzis released last month. Issued
by Jan Krukowski arid Company. the re—
port explores perceptions of Grinnell on
campus and nationwrde, and makes rec-
onimendaticns based on these pcrccpr
tions.

The intention ofthe study was to “bole
ter understand the position of Grinnell in
the marketplace, to determine how
Grinnell Could expand its applicant pool,
and to determine the significance of allilr
tion,“ as written in the report.

Deanof the College Jim Swai'lz said
that the intention of the report was also
“for us to understand how students pei'r
cerve the college,”

Swaitz is the chair of the Admission
and Student Financial Aid Committee.
which continuestodiscusstlie Krukowski
report and its significance to the college.
The committee includes three students.
Andy Hicken ‘98,E1Ina Koretsky ‘99. an
Ivy Chang ‘01, ~

Faculty‘s perceptions ofthe college, as
well as studcnts' perceptions, are included
in the report. The report communicated
this faculty opinion ofthe students: "Face
ulty see students as idealistic.
hardworking, but also rarcly willing to
take intellectual risks or fully cxlcnd
themselves,"

Dave Rosenthal ‘01 disagreed. “I
don't think that applies to the average 5th
dent," he said, noting that in a small col-
lege students receive individttal attention,
forcing them to take risks. l-Ic contended
that a student learns at Giinnell not by
simply taking notes and tests, but by tier
iively participating in class.

Although students value academics,
they value intangibles such as fl iendship
more, according to the study, One pror
lessor was cited in the report as saying,
“Given the choice between leading an
an assignment or spending time cheep
ing up a friend who is a little depressed,
the assignment will have to wait "

Students overwhelmingly agreed with
the statement. Michelle Dean '00 ex—
plained. “I definitely agree. I‘ve done it
before. . .What am I going to think about
in ten years? Friends are important."

The study also reported that “Grinnell
is seen by both students and faculty to
be homogeneous," It ruiihcr cxplttmcd
that Grinnell was homogeneous not only
in ethnicity, but also in thought. A stur
dent iii the report was qnotcd (is saying,
“We think we are very liberal, and ycl
we are very conservative in one way. We
are notdiversc, not multicultural. and we

Mock Trial Team Goes To‘Nationals

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Contributing Writer

For the ﬁrst time, the Grinnell College
Mock Trial team qualiﬁed for the Golden
Flight National competition to be held
April 45 in Des Moincs.

“We're pretty excited." commented the
team's coordinator. Kate Burns ‘99. “This
is the highest we’ve ever placed at
regionals. and we have ‘a pretty young
team."

The team ensured its place at nation-
als by placing second to Washburn Col-
lege at the regional competition Febru-
ary 13715 at Avila College, On an indi-
vidual level. Andy Lee ‘98 received the
Outstanding Attorney Award

Part ofthc preparation for competition
began last semester, when the team was
assigned a mock case. complete with
rules, evidence, and affidavits. In No-
vember, the team members selected their
roles; Nathan Quancc ‘01,Meghun
Samuelson ‘01, and Julian Zebot ‘00
chose to be witnesses, while Burns, Lee,
Emily Mize ‘Ol, Laura Ltndgard ‘99, and
Darwin C1epper‘99 chose to be lawyers.

Preparation differed for the two roles
Witnesses, for example, had to memorize
affidavits and bone acting skills. Ex-
plained Quancc. “The idea [for witnesses]
is to be in character. You have to really
know your affidavit so you don't say

something [contradic-
toryl,”

Lawyers, on the other
hand, concentrated on
writing and improvising
questions, As a ﬁrstryear
lawyer. Mize said, “I put
a lot ofpressure on myself,
I’d rather write a lOrpagc
paper than a closing.”

While team members
had some jobs that were
exclusive to their roles, all
worked together in deter-
mining team strategy.
Practices were scheduled
about three times pcr week
after winter break. During
this time, Samuelson ex-
plained. the team would
“do rehearsals. . . [lawyers
would present] openings
and closings. and every-
one would critique each
other."
