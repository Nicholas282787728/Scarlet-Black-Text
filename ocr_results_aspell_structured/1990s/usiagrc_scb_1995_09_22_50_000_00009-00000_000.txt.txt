In the Coffee?

BY DAN BUE'I'I‘NER

You ivould be surprised at some
of the stuffl get in the mail in my
capacity as newspaper editor. Aside
from the expected—tons and tons of
junk mail, bills, and paymentsil
find, from time to time, a real gem
among the stacks. This week, there
were two items ofparticular interest:
a newspaper put out by a white su—
premacist organization in Georgia,
the second a request for advertising
from a pro—life organization in St.
Paul, Minnesota,

I picked upthe newspaper, iron»
ically entitled The Truth At Last.
one afternoon, and got a few chuck-
les outofit. Thesheerridiculousness
oftheir claims, and their rabid, anti—
black, anti—gay, anti—semitic, antir
immigrant, antiryou»if»you’rernot«
just-like—me rhetoric were pretty
amusingizlt(ltstglance,anV\Vay. I‘ll
show you a little of what I mean.

A column on page four, which
lists a number ofparticulnrly violent
crimes allegedly committed by Afri—
can—Americans (whom the paper re—
fers to only as “Negroes") ends with
this little epitaph:

“We believe that it is the natural
heritage of African savagery which
has been reawakened in them by the
agitators of the civil rights move
ment. Since they have not been able
to achieve equality with the Whites
because of their low IQ. they lash
out in hatred. This is a national
threat."

Another spicy little treat was a
paragraph on Bill Clinton’s reforms
in the area of homosexual rights.
Headlined "Clinton Rewards Homos
for Support,“ it begins:

"It is of interest that the homo
lobby raised some $6.5 million for
Clinton’s campaign for president,
They were well aware of Clinton’s
approval of their "alternative [ifer
style.” They knew that he would
back every item in faggotry's agent
da‘ii

Theatticlegoes on to claimthat
Clinton’s “personal debauched life—
style makes him embrace others en.
gaged in all sorts ofsexual abnormal—

Some othetamusingtidbits were
the ways the paper refers to homo-
sexual acts as “crimes against na—
ture.“ decries the Clinton adminis—
tration’s gays-in-the—military policy,
refers to gay men as ”homes,” and
generally teats apart anyone who
varies even slightly from an image of
someone who is, basically, a Nazi.
All in all, the paper made for a good
laugh. Thenl threw it away.

Opening theadvertisingrequest,
I expected a small, three— or four»
inch ad, something similar to what
we usually run. What l found was
verydifferent—there was a cover letr
ter asking for “editorial approval" to
tuna“newspapersupplement,”which
is unusual, Upon closer examiner
tion, the “supplement” turned out to

bea 12-pnge, fullacolornewspapcrin
itselt,choclefullorprodiiephotos—
photos of what, you can guessizmd
propaganda. lwill admit that it was
tastefully done, and that it was no—
where near as offensive as some of
the pro-life garbage I’ve seen, but the
first image that popped into my head
wasthatofapeacefulFridaymoming
on the Grinnell campus. students
meander into the post office after
their eleven o'clock class to pick up
their weekly 8&3. The quiet is sudt
denly shattered by a mass howl of
indignation as students are exposed
to pictures cialicirted fetuses. Amob
descends upon Main 3rd, room
1320.. .and you can picture the rest.

The advertising request also
made for a few good laughs. My
friends and I spent an entire dinner
at Quad laughing about it. Perhaps
the best suggestion was that I bill the
organization for one million dollars
in unmarked bills, tip front, and then
leave the country after dropping the
paper offat the printer Friday morn»
ingithe underlying assumption be»
ing that 1 could never show my face
on campus again afterallowingsomer
thing like that to be printed. We
were almost in hysterics over the
whole thing Then someone sug—
gested that, in lieu ofa better idea, I
write my column about these things.

That suggestion made me stop
and think about the whole situation.
I went back to the SGtB office, fished
the stuff out of the circular file, and
read it all over again, It‘s all well and
good, at least at Grinnell, to laugh
about the ignorance displayed by sue
ptemacist organizations, or to imag—
ine the campus reacting to a 12—page
pro-life propaganda section in the
5&8. What is significantly less fun
ny is to stop laughing and realize that
there really are people in this nation
who believe that sort of stuff. What
is not funny at all is to realize what
kind ofsupport, specificallywhat kind
of money, these organizations must
have.

I‘ve been in the publishing busi—
ness for about five years now, and I
know enough about it to be able to
make some educated guesses about
what these peoplespent to print their
propaganda. A lZ—page newspaper
printed exactly as the one I received
would have cost a bundle. Let me
assume, for the sake of argument,
that if The Truth at Last sent a copy
toGrinnellCollegeinGrinnell,Iowa,
that theysentacopy to every univerr
sity and college in the United States.
How many colleges and universities
do you suppose there are in the 11.8.7
Their bill would have run into the
thousands, if not the tens of thou—
sands, for printing and mailing.

The lZ—page advertisement from
“HumanLife AllianceofMinnesota,
Inc.,” run in full color, would have
cost far more. Supposing they also
sent a copy to every college and uni—
versity in the U.S., they spent tens of
thousands of dollars just to send out
samples, In addition to that, they
would have to pay to have the inserts
printed, as well as having to pay the
student newspapers a fair amount of
money in advertising fees. A sheet

 

included ivith the ad claimed that
9.4 million copies have been circu-
latedtodate. That means that they've
spent perhaps as much as a hundred
thousand dollars on printing alone.

Even if you take these numbers
with a large grain of salt—as you
should, since they are barely ball—
parkiil means that these organizar
tions have support. Very few people
spend thousands of dollars on a lark;
I have to assume that there are pear
ple out there, lots of people, buying
advertising, sending subscription fees
and making donations. Which brings

us to the realization I came to early
Thursday morning.

I have read much about the so—
called conservative backlash in this
country, and I have watched Newt
Gingrich’s rise to power with some
nervousness, but, given the rather
mild brand of conservatism professed
by Gingrich and most other GOP
politicians, l was never terribly cont
cemed. The Truth at Last sewed to
make me concerned. I’m concerned
about the social, moral and political
beliefs of these people, and I’m conr
cemed about the money that I know

must be arrayed behind them. And
I’m very, very concerned about what
they’re going to do with it.

You can write to this newspaper
at this address, or you can stop by my
room on Main 3rd to see it.
