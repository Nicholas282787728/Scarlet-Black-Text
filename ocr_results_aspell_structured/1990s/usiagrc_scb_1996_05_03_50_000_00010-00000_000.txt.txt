Hypocrisy All Around Us

Before I actually begin this
week‘s topic, I apologize for an error
in last week's article. I condemned
Germany for taxing its citizenry at a
rate in the neighborhood ofsixty or
severity percent. In reality, the rate
is a little above 45 percent. A tax
rate in the higher range exists in
other Eurasian nations, and I had
mis<recalled my source, which spoke
of both Germany and these other,
even more draconian, structures.

Okay, back to the real world.

About two or three weeks ago,
the movie Waiting to Exhale played
in Harris Cinema, courtesy of the
SGA Films Committee. After set-
tling into my seat for the movie,
wishing there were better footrests
than the chairs in front of me, I
watched intently as the plot began to
play out. Soon the moVie came to
the scene where a black husband
leaves his wife for a white woman
The exchange goes something like
the following:

“You are leaving me for a white
woman?!"

“Would it be better if she were
black?"

“It would be better if you were
black!”

And most of the crowd (or at
least the black female contingent
thereof) showed its appreciation of
the sentiment. Now here we have a
classic example of something I can—
not easily iustify, When Hollywood
wants to make a character seem ei—
ther evil or stupid, one of the meth—
ods used is to have him (normally
white. normally male, almost always
one ofthe two) makesome racialslur
imbued with about as much wit as a
piece ofearwax. Hoivever,whenthe
reverse is done, a black woman ab
tacking someone for not being black
enough (funny how black is defined
in this context), it is done in a very
biting manner and is supposed to
carry some positive weight for the
bigot in question.

The hypocrisy in this is twofold.
First we simply have a double stan—
dard in Hollywood, and in the world
in general, concerning what is con.
sidered positive humor and what is
considered negative humor, It is
positive for a minority to make well—
crafted pot shots at white males while
it is negative for a white man to call
a black “nigger.” (Though, of course
itisperfectlyﬁne forblackstouse the
term amongst themselves). The sec-
ond layer of hypocrisy comes from
the audience and its reaction to the
moVie. Minoritieshave led an attack

on many fronts attacking people for
seeing a difference between individ«
utils based onrace, gender, etc. How—
ever, the supporters of this move
ment see nothing wrong about per»
ceiving a difference themselves, as
long as they see their race, gender.
etc. as superior in some way. The
ludicrous thing about this is simply
that they are being encouraged by
millions to attack an action in which
they themselves partake. One thing
worse than a bigot is a hypocritical
one,

It really shouldn’t be much of a
surprise that his type of institution
(hypocritical reverse bigotry) eitists
in oursociety. The accepted, institiir
tionalited method of lighting bigot.
ry, affirmative action, asks its panic»
ipanrs to take race into account for
the purpose ofmaking sure race is not
taken into account.

And this incident is not limited
to the demesne of entertainment,
etc. either, That same idea of not
labeling people by the groups to which
they hold allegiance did not stop
someone from changingthe College
Republicans signs to read "vax [Nat
zis] for information." Nor did the
same contingent who Enjoyed mak—
ing subtle insinuations that Rush
Limbaugh was responsible for the
OklahomaCitybombingfinditatall
tolerable to state the link between
the Unabomber and various factions
of liberalism, And I am last wonder»
ing where the NAACP was when
Alan Keyes was banned from a de-
bate among the GOP candidates.
How restrained do you think the
black community would be if Jesse
Jackson were banned from a debate?
The difference— Alan Keyes is a pr0r
life conservative,

There are hypocritical inconsis—
tencies that run through all layers of
"progressive" (both fiscal and social)
strata. Bill Clinton is now attacking
congress as being too harsh because
it only wants Medicare to grow at
twice the level of inflation (BTW,
this was the plan he proposed in ‘94,
but that was back when his party
controlled congress). I know this is
unfair, using Clinton as an example
oi hypocrisy. Liberals everywhere
are gettingabad name becausesome—
oneexceptionally predisposedtodlSr
honesty currently is the head of their
party.

I admit that such hypocrisy also
taints the Republican party. The
most prominent example in recent
history is the current proposal put
forth by a few weak Republicans in
theHousetoraisetheminimumwage
over the next year or two There is
no excuse for this buckling, and I
hope that these congressmen are re—
placed this next election..,by per—
sons running on their own [mkeli

Student referendums next week

student referendums will be voted
on in the dining halls next Tuesday and
the post officeonwcdnesday. These are
all oi the referendums which have been
submitted, not all oitheiii mayappearon

be collected. The last two, regarding the
Expsrlmenral College and prison labor,
may be revised slightly but will remain
substantively the same Please voice
your opinion one way or the other on
each of these next week,

P/F or S/D/F Deadline Move:

We would like to have the deadline
lotsivitchirigacoutsetooritomS/D/For
P/F grading moved several weeks farther
intoasemester. Thecurrenttystem does
not allow students an adequate amount
of time to assess their performance in
their classes. The deadline for students
to change a course to or irom SID/F
grading is a mere three weeks into a
semester. Many students will not have
had any graded work retunied to them,
or even received assignments more in.
depth than readings, that early in u se.
mester. it is unrealistic to expect Stu»
dents to make a decision about SID/F
without any graded material to base it
on. The deadline should be moved back
several weeks on the calender, to, say,
theweeksprecedingiallandspringbteak,
to give students the opportunity to more
accurately assess both the demands of
their courses and their performance in
them.

Revert to Pass/Fail:

We would like to have the S/D/F
system ofgrading reverted to the old P/F
system. The original intent oi the WP
system was to encourage students to
brunch out into unfamiliar disciplines
without being to concerned widi their
final grade, and PIF accomplished that
remarkably well. For someone taking
two or three demanding upper level
courses, taking an introductory course Pl
F was a viable option. In theory, it
allowed students to concentrate on the
work ferthoseclasses whichwerevitalro
their maior, butsrill broaden their herb
zons in another discipline. A good mea.
sure ofthat flexibility basbeen removed
with the change to S/D/F. While it is
true that a few students occasionally
took advantage of the system, doing a
bare minimumoiwork in order to get by,
itwtsunfairtoseriousstudentstochangc
the system because of those iew. The
new system simply does not oifer as safe
an option for students who are truly
interested in branchingout, but who are
also concerned about treading on unia.
miliar ground.

buffer Days:

we would like to have some addi.
tional time at the end oieach semester
between the end of classes and the be—
ginning of die examination week, we
feel that giving students more buffer
days, both to relax and to study between
the time they complete classes and writ.
ten work and the time they have to take
finals exams would be very beneiicial,
both to our states of mind and to the
quality oiouriinished work. Some peo.
ple have argued against this, saying that
studentswillsimply go outandparty,but
our reasoning is lluS: her some relax«
ation is essential to our mental health,
and mental health is in short supply at
the end of a semester. Second, we are

trusted to know when to work and when
to party all year. and almost all of us are
mature enough to choose wisely

Photography Coulses:

we would like to have the Air
department oiier courses in pliotogra»
phy that are not simply [auglu as over.

but rather allow students to assemble
their own photography shows and port.

Course Evaluations Publiciaed:

we the students oi Criniiell Col.
lege. request that starting in the Fall
Semester 19%, course evaluntlons be
published and made available to all stu.
dents wishing to consult them before
registering ior classes There has been
much complaint that students have lit.
tic toy in the curriculum and iaculty
hiring decisions, but this is one way in
which students can voice opinions in a
manner more eiiective than wordoi
mouth. Assuming thatstudentsl choices
at registration are reflective oi student
needs, the administration will be in a
position to know better the diversity oi
concerns that need to be addressed. The
publishing or course evaluations would
be more effective for both students and
administration because it will aid stu.
dents directly in their decisions and be-
cause ir will give students the opportunh
ty to make informed choices. licourse
evaluations are made publicly available,
students can speak to each other and to
the administration about the strengths
and weaknesses of the Grinnell educa.
tion. lipublished, evaluations from one
semester would be available before pre.
registration for the term that follows a
year afterward. For instance, evalua—
tions ior classes in the iall semester oi
one year would be available when stu.
dents preregister, in the spring. iot the
i'olloivingi‘all. Courseevaluationswould

of which would be on reserve in the
library and available to each academic
department, ior students to browse
through or to use as a reference.

Dining Hall West .

An oitenheard complaint is in re»
gard to the amount oi iood wasted in the
dininghallt. While it is undeistood that
it is difficult to gage the appropriate food
needs to be cooked for the student body,
there is no excuse lor throwing it all
away, Two ideas are being proposed to
ameliorate such wasteiui prncuces:

i. Grinnell College should get a
license that would enable it to give iood
to homeless shelters in Des Moines and
Iowa City.

2. Grinnell College should start a
composting program where by much oi
the food could be turned into organic
iertilizer instead of being thrown away.
This is being done successfully in several
collegesin discounrry it is anexcellent
way to show our respect ior the natural
world.

Full—Time Counselor:

We, the students of Grinnell Col-
lege, decry the lack of mental health

services geared toward college students
undergoing the stresses placed upon us.
Although helpful to some, the proie.
sionals at the Orinnell Mental Health
Center are not capable of meeting the
inn needs oi‘orinnell College students.
we feel that Crinnell College should
line tit least one iulinme counselorwlie
