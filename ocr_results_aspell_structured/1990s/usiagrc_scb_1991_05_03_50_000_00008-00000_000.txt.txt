some of the answers:

“Ahh. he‘s a great guy. One of
Ihe best civil nghLS leaders of the
century," - “He‘s better than
Hendrix but not as good as Vai.
"Ireally like his hair." -“He’s gotta
be one of the soulfulcsl while guys
I know.” - “He‘s a jerk. All he
thinks abouris himself," - “He's an

cartoons are offensive and stupid."
- “I think everyone should try lo he

As you can see. we are all idiols
here. No doubt about it. But hey.
everybody seemed to really enjoy
Buddy Guy. and who knows. good
ole Tinsley might even play a solo
in the audience just like the good
old days. Well. anyway, Tinsley
Ellis is a talented young man, and
you wouldn'texacdy be givin' him
achmce if you didn’iatleem show
up at Harris tonight around 9 » 9:30
and have a few brews. I mean it
would he the decent thing to do.
Buddy would've done it. That's
all"
