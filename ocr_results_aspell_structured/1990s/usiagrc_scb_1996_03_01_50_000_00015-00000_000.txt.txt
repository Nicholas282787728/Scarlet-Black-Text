: from

the Olympics to Grinnell

The year 1980 brings back paint
ful memories for Grinnell College
track coach Will Freeman but it also
marked a crucial turning point inhis
philosophy of sportr

lt was the year he was hoping to
represent Lhe United States in the
summer Olympics as a pole vaulter,
an honor that many athletes could
only dream of. Following a second—
place finish at the 1980 indoor na«
tional championships at Madison
Square Garden inNY, Freeman found
out, in a cab on the way to the nip
port, that President Carter would

dream had come to an abrupt end.

The dream began during his se-
nior year of high school in Lexing—
ton, Kentucky. Alatebleomerphys.
ically, Freeman lacked the size need<
ed to play contact sports such as
football or basketball so he gravitat-
ed towards track, a sport in which his
brother excelled,I Freeman did not
enjoy much athletic succes‘s during
his first few years of high schoolbut,
aftergrowingsiitincheshisf‘inalyear,
Freeman soon moved'from the third
best pole vaultet on his high school
team to fifth in the nation. This was
the first of a number of experiences
that have shapedhisattitude towards
sports, L ‘ , -

Freeman was impressed by the
attention and popularity showered
upon him in the wake of his new—
found success, as any teenager would
lie. “I was astounded by how much
attention I received," admits Free—
man, but he now realizes that most of
the attention given him was not a
result of who he was but rather what
he did He decries the message that
he was given through this experience
that winning is the only path to suc-
cess, which is the same message that
continues to be conveyed to many

high school athletes today.

Because of his athletic accom<
plishments, Freeman was offered a
full ride scholarship to the UniVeiSir
ty of Florida where he enjoyed four
years of successful competition in the
pole vault. After graduation, he
joined one ofthe premier track clubs
in the country and seemed to be on
the right course for a future shot at
the Olympics otter an eighth place
finish in the Olympic Trials for the
1975,5ummer Games in Montreal.
During the Trials, Freeman had an—
other experiencc that would play an
instrumental role in shaping his phie
losophy

“I was eatinglunchone day with
a number of athletes, Bruce Jenner,
the deeathlete, was there alongwith
some fellow pole vaulters. A survey
spomored by the US Olympic Com
mittee had been handed out and we
were discussing the questions during
the meal. We were laughing and
joking about most of the questions
until we came to one which read: If,
by taking steroids, you would win a

gold medal buty by the same token, '
, would die of liver Failure within ﬁve

“I remember feeling sort oflike
my arm had gotten cut off," recalls
Freeman describing his reaction to
the news. “It was as ifl had lost part
of my identity.” The portion of his
identity lost was that of a world—class
pole vaulter who had spent the past
four years of his life tmining for and
countless years dreaming of the op-
portunity to compete for Olympic
gold. Although this dream was never
realized, Freeman has gleaned many
valuable lessons from the attempt
and has used them to create a spora
philosophy that he now passes on to
his students at Grinnell.

After competing in the Olym<
pic'l'rials, whichwas basically a“non—
meet". Freeman packed his bags and
drove with his wife to Gtinnell, “At
first we were brainwashed by this
place into believing that quality ath—
letics and quality academics were
mutually exclusive here," said Free-
man. He has since then proven that
this is wrong by emphasizing the val»
ue that sports have, in helping to
develop healthy individuals

the pressure to succeed and at what
cost to their health, he asks,

After the 1976 Trials, Freeman
was forced to make a decision about
his athletic future and he concluded
that four years of his life were worth
the chance of becoming an Olympi—
an. By 1978 Freeman was jumping
great but the rigorous training had
takenits tolland he was feeling burnt
out, As a result, he decided to take a
year off during which time Freeman
realized that pole vaulting had be—
come something that he felt he had
to do and irwas no longer fun. Sports
should, after all, be enjoyable, he
said.

Droppinghts clubafﬁliationaiid
the associated pressures of having to
justify their financial support, Free
man entered 1980 unattached to any
clubs with the mindset that he was
going to have fun and achieve the
goals he had set three years earlier.
He picked up where he had left off
the previous year and was placing
well in international meets but then
came the news of the boycott.

second?

Freeman believes that sporo
helps promote discipline, commit»
merit, and persistence—three at;
tributes which are highly valued in
our society He also believes that as
humanbeingsweinnarelycravecbal-
lenge and that athletics provides an
excellent forum for that. But, as
Freemanwellknows, those challenge
es must be put into perspective and
not taken too seriously. “I spent {our
years training to jump over a stick
with another stick and when I look
back on it I can‘t say that it was all
worth it. I learned a lot, but had put
all of my eggs in one basket and the
boycott put a quick end to it.”

As a society, we must always
keep in mind that there will be win—
ners and losers in sports but that has
nothing to do with our personal self«
worth. Athletics on the amateur
level should be used as a vehicle for
reitimpteyement andrecreation, but
nothing more because, artet all, i it is
supposed to be a game."
