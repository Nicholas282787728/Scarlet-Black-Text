tree, decorate it to your own tastes
including the date for the year and
make a perforation on one edge fora

the tree as an ornament. Before too

Mark Dorr, you missed a wonderful
concert. Mark was given the opportu-
nity this summer to organize a concert
band at Grinncll College, and he did a
marvelous job. He not only recruited
talented college musicians, but in a
time when Dr. Osgood is calling for
community outreach, Mark reached
out to the community and invited them
to participate in this concert band.

Congratulations to Mark Don and
theGrirrrrcll College SymphonicBand.
We appreciate your efforts to add an-
other dimension to our cultural enjoy»
ment in Grinnell, and look forward to
many more outstanding concerts! e
