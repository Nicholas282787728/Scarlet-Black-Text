”You’re pregnant.”

Those words were hard to hear.
The decision was harder to make.

After I struggled with what to do, I realized that I tusl couldn’t

lace a pregnancy at that polnl tn my lite. i decided to have an
. aborllon, but l didn’t know where to go
or who to turn to. Then a lrlend tecolllr
mended that I call Planned Parenthood
No one at Planned Parenthood was
judgmental. They left the decision up to
me and they assured me that my Vlsll
would be completely Confidential. l
appreciated that.
From the start, they were ktnd,
senslllvc, and professional. They
explained everything in (leiall and answered all my quesnons,
They really scorned 10 care about me,
l’m thankful that Planned Parenthood was there (or me. i
hope none of nly friends ever have to lace such a hard decision.
