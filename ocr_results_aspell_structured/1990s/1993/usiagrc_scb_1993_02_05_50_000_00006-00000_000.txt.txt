Bill was tired. Dying takes a lot
out 01 a person.

Bill thought. "Now that I'm
dead, what else can happen to
me? I mean, I'm dead, right?"

Suddenly Goo appeared
and said, "Bill, you must live
again!"

Bill screamed, "No!t!l!!!!"

Streamsotcolorandwaves
ot loree struck his body.

The next thing he knew, he
was a fetus.
