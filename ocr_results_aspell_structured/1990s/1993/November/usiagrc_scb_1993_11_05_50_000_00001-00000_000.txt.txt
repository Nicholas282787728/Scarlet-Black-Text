could be both a numerical deﬁnition,
as those social groups with a lesser
amount of people, or a group that is
less accountable than others, one that
needs helporassistance. Bylerherself
deﬁned this group to be one who is
“disempowered or disenfranchised"
with no power, no choice,and no tools
for change available to them. ”It is
only when we think of these groups as
expendable or ridiculed ‘othcrs’ who
don‘t matter, and if we think that their
disappearance will not affect us, then
we should be worried," says Bylcr.
She notes that no culture is free of
these ‘others', and two groups are

the people who have power need to
give some up, while the people who

need power should make claim to it.
Bylcr spoke on two topics: reli-

rights, she related many cases of reli—
