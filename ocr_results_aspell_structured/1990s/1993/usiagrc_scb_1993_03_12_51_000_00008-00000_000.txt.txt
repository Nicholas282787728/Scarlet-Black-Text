ties which would have netted us an-
other 35 points. Then we would have
been challenging for top honors.“
There were plenty of results for
Freeman to be excited about, espe

cially the effort by senior sprinter
Darren Young. He figured in the scor-
ing of37 Grinnell points, earning co-
MVP meet honors with Coe’s Todd
Henccke. Freeman commented, “It
was an amaztng two days for Darren.
Consider the fact that he had knee

Men’s Tennis Team Wins vs.
Cornell in Conference Opener

Team Drops Season Opener Against UNI

by Todd Young

HE Grinnell College tennis

team opened its Midwest

Conference schedule Tuesr
day by hosting Cornell. Grinnell won
the match 7-2, with senior No. 1
player Mark Reynolds leading the
way with a 6-2, 6-1 victory in his
match. In last year's Mtdwest Con-
ference tournament the Pioneers
edged the Rams for fifth place.

Coach David Arscneault
stated prior to the match, “This
match will provide us with a good
earlyrseason test against a qualr
ity conference opponent."

In the opening meet of the year
Grinnell lost, 9-0, to the University
of Northern Iowa. Arseneault
said,“This year’s contest was the
best we have played against UNI in
the past four years, and their team

was the best they have had. We won
sets in two matches and should have
won a set in No. 1 singles." While
UNI does not grant scholarships to
its tennis players, it is an NCAA
Division 1 school.

In No. 1 singles Mark Reynolds
was defeated, 376, 577, in a match
marred by some blatantly incorrect
line calls. The nextday UNI’s player
called toapologizeforhispoorspons»
manship. Both Alan Jeffers at No. 3
singlesandScanBarryaiNo.45ingles
won one of three sets.

Reflecting on his team’s perfor-
mance, Arseneault said,”From the
early indications of this match we
appear to be a year older and a year
better, which is very encouraging."

Grinnell will host two non-con—
fercnce opponents, Wartburg and
Central, next week before playing
Wisconsin-Whitewater and Sinclair
College away over break.

His final race was lheanchorleg oftlie
4x400 relay in which he and Dexter,
Dieter King and Scott Newstrom
placed fourth. Rookie Dexter also ran
fifth in lhcAOO while Brett Burton was
sixth in the 55M.

continued improvement and focus,
we should have a chance at the out~

Track Meet Marked by Team
and Individual Improvement

HAT a coach wants in a big track meet is for everyone on
the team toperform atherbest. Grinnell Collegewomen’s
coach Evelyn Freeman saw nearly all of her athletes do

that last weekend at the Midwest Conference championships.

“On the whole just about everyone on the team had best marks of
the season, and some saw substantial improvements,” commented
Freeman.

Coe won the meet with 118 points while Monmouth was second
with 99. The Pioneers placed ninth of 11 teams with 11 points. The
finish was three places better titan last year. “For the first time in years
we fielded somebody in every event,” sziid Freeman. “Our season is a
few weeks shorter titan most teams’, and that might have made a
difference in a few places.”

Rookie Stephanie Hitztaler was the top indivtdual, placing fourth
and sixth in the 1500M and 800M. Her times of 5:095 and 2:29.24
were her fastest of the year. Another rookie, Ally Beckman, ﬁnished
fourth in the 5000M with a time of19253.4.

Thc otherpointscame from thePioncers’ relay units. In the 4x200
race Jennifer Jones, Alny Reinhart, Janice Lee and Rissy Taylor
combined to finish slxlh in a time of 1:54.48. Lee, Joneskelnhart and
Rotnmany Chanthavong also finished sixth in the 4x400 event with a
time of 4:26.26.

Freeman noted that Roinhart narrowly missed finals in a few
sprint events which could have meant more points.

The mentor had praise for Holly Pfitsch, Jennifer Jacobson and
Maureen Ncss who cut time in their respective distance events. She
was also pleased with Teri Derrickson’s effort in the 1000M, which
was her first race of the season.

With the entire team competing for the ﬁrst time this season,
Freeman called the meet a good team builder. She finalized, “We
should be stronger at the outdoor championships because distance
events are added to the schedule. Our strength is definitely in our
distance corps."
