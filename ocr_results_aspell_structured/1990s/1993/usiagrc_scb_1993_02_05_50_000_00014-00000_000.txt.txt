Football Team Starts Early
Momin g Workout Program

Team is Determined to Change Tradition of Losing Seasons

by Adam White

INETEEN ninety-two was
not the best of years for
Grinnell football. The team

struggled through a year that was
plagued by injuries and a lack of
manpower, finishing with a 0-9
record. However, 1993 has lheteam
lookingahead withoptimism,thanks
in pan to a new weight program that

has the players reponing to the PEC
at 6:15 am. four days a week,

Head coach Greg Wallace said
thatthenewprogram reﬂectsachange
in attitude. Most players are taking
pan in the program even though it is
not mandatory. Said Wallace of this
dedication, “it says a lot for the type
of guys we‘ve got."

Considering the first game is not
[or another seven months, such a
progratn may seem premature. How-

sun. The football ptnym have recently been Vtstlillg

ever, as Wallace explained, “if we're
going to be competitive in the Mid-
WestConference,wecan’twaitfora
bunch of new recruits. We have to
win with the guys we've got."

And as far as the recruiting.
Wallace said that while he is Dplir
mistic. he will not be able to tell
what kind of recruiting success he
and his staff have had until applica-
tions start coming in during Febru-
ary.

young. talented runners to combine
with some experienced hat-tiers.

Veteran distance runners will
guide the squad in its quest to move
up Iheconlcrcncc ladder. Kata Beach,
who placed fourth in the league in
cross country, Will be running track
for the first time in her cttrcer. Two
other all»conferencc cross country
runners, Amy Harris and Jennifer
Jacobson,joln her. Gretel Kiefer and
Janice Lee are experienced and fo-
cused on middle distance.

chek arealsc slatcd to compete in the

nell lo the team title in cross country
last fall, placing second overall,
Beckman was 10th at the loop meet
while Dvorachek. who will also run
