Students Lack Time for Politics

By Sarah Cornell

OLlTICS is always a sticky business Although Gnnnellizlns have the
Preparation of being politically aware and active despite our ‘isolalion’ in the
Iowa cornﬁelds, a great dull of Grinnell‘s students do not consider them-

selves to be politically active.

But yes, Grinnellians are deﬁnitely aware. They [ride themselves on being
awareofcunentevents: Prolife/Pro—Choiceisms, thebanon gays in themilitary,
prevention of violence against women, and myriad other mums. But political
activity requires a greitdeal oftime that Grinnellian‘sjustdm’thave to spare.

With ﬁnals time appoaching, even the issues affecting Grinnellians the most
tendIobepushedtothebackground,whilepapasandexamsgetmomdemanding.
But cenainly some Grinnellians are conscious objectors to the whole politically
active “m."

One student, who had jug left her political parties clam when approacl’ed {(1

or care to admit

Grinnell deﬁnitely has a “liberal" reputation. To some, liberal means that the
Campus Democrats are more visible than the Republicans, and to others, it means

”You’re pregnant.’ ’

Those words were hard to hear.
The decision was harder to make.

Attert struggled wllh what lo (lo, l realized that I iustcouldn’t
face a pregnancy al that point in my lite. ldecitled |o have an
. abortlon, but I didn't know where to go
or who to turn to Then a triend recom-
mended thai | (all Planned Parenthood.
No one at Planned Parenthood was
judgmental. They left the decision up to
me and they assured me that my visil
would be completely confidential l
appreciated that.
From the start, they were kind,
sensitive, and professional, They
explained everything in detail and answered all my questions.
They really seemed to care about me.
I’m thankful lhal Planned Parenthood was there tor me. l
hope none or my friends ever have lo lace such a hard decision.
But it they do, l know Planned Parenthood Will be there for

them, too.
