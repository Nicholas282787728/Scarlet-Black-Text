candidate,ihecandid2ite’s spouseand
employer to determine the suitabilr
ity of the individual for thejob. The
potential firefighter then participates
in one of the department’s monthly
two-hour drills, an exercise that
serves both as an indicator of the
applicants ability to work with the
otherfirefightersandasanintroduc-
tion into the life ofa firefighter.

The fire department then votes
on the admission of the applicant.
According to Thompson, people are
generally only denied admittance if
they are incapable of meeting the
physical demands of the job.

Currently, all of the Grinnell
firedepartment’s staffis male. How'
ever, Thompson noted that the de-
partment did have one female
firefighter. “Jennifer Grinnell, a
Grinnell College graduate, was with
us for just under a year," he ex-
plained, adding that, ”she injured
her knee and her doctor advised her
to leave the fire service.”

ApariicularfavoriteoftheGrinr
nell population and an invaluable
tool in teaching fire safety to chil-
dren is Thompson‘s Daltnation
Deedee. He has trained the dog,
which serves as the departments
mascot, to “stop, drop androll," and
to do other tricks that mimic fire
safety techniques.

The Grinnell Fire Department
has a wide range of vehicles and
equipment, ranging from their mas»
sive 1991 75 it. ladder and pump
truck to their sprightly 4wd Chevy
brush truck. However, their most
distinguished piece of equipment is
their 1913 AmericaaneFranee fire
truck, the oldest motorized vehicle
in the state of Iowa. This fascinating
historical piece has been fully rer
storedand,thoughitnolongcrserves
as a fire fighting tool, is an impres-
sive parade piece.

All of this equipment is mean~
ingless, though, without the dedica-
tion and selflessness of the volun-
teers andregulars who man theGrin~
nell Fire Department.

the Fine Arts Building

one will noticeseveral signs directr

office. Chances are if you‘re not a
musicianonthiscampus,thesesigns
may be a bit mysterious to you. as
they were to me,

I followed the signs down the
hallway until i got to a big black
door with a small map, displaying
the routes of Amuack across the
United States. I knocked on the
door, and a cheerful man with a
welcoming smile opened the door
and invited me in.

A room full orbits of technol-
ogy surrounded me as I stepped in.
A massive amplifier, tape players,
microphones, random wires, a
chordless phone, and a Macintosh
computer, to name a few, were all
crammed into his office. Several
AAA travel books to Texas and the
surrounding area lay on a table. An
Official Railway Guide Sat promi-
nently on his shelf.

One of the first things I asked
Paul was what exactly hisjob was.
He sort of laughed and said, ”titles
are a funny thing.” He pulled out
the pink faculty phone directory
and flipped to his name. It said
“Music Department Technical As-
srsiant.“ His card, which he had
handed me along with several mun
sicprograms and the Music Dcparlr
mentNewsletter, gives him the title
“Administrative Supervisor, Sing-
ers Tour Director." But from my
impression, I thinkl‘d give him the
title of Music Department Santa
Claus.

A member of The Grinnell
Singers, Shannon l-ledike told me
that before Paul was around the

 

Paul and His Workshop

JIM morn

PAUL NELSON IN His WORKSHOP: Paul can always tr found doing something for someone like
planning rhc Singers (our, ordering something fort/12 Electronic Music Studio, or hclping bud-
ding musicians With their instruments.

Singers had to plan their oivn tours
across the country. She relayed a
story to me that as a rcsultof having
to plan Iheir own tours, the Singers
ended up once driving around Chi-
cago for hours looking for a little
church. With Paul around the Singr
ers get to exactly where they need to
be on Lime.

But planning tours isn’t all that
Paul does. Anytime musicians need
equipmentofany sortPaul is the man
they go to. And he seems to be quite
friendly and willing to oblige with
any problems that may come along.
Paul seems to be a small little bless-
ing placed upon the music depart-
mem.

How he ended up at Grinnell is
an interesting story in itself, and Paul

himself admits he gets “puzzled how
these funny things happen."

The story goes like this: he was
getting fed up and overwhelmed with
ajob he was working at tn Minnesota,
so hcdecided to “retire” from thatyoh
and take some time off to look for
another job. One day he was looking
through the Des Moines Register and
came across a Job position put out by
Grinnell College, thathe explains al-
most i‘it his resume to a tee.

Because of his diverse interests,
including being a semi»professional
french horn player, working for six
years in network television, holdinga
degree in music and mass communi-
cations, it was almost weird for him
to find a job that fit so well, particu-
larlybecauscthecommunity ofGn'nA

nell was sosimilarinalotofwaysto
his hometown of Winoa, MN.

l-lelaughed and told abouthow
he and his wife had joked that the
only thing missing from the job
description was something that in-
quired about his interest in railr
roads. But when they got here they
found the railroad track that drives
straight through the center of the
campus.

Paul Nelson in a lot of ways is
Grinnell Music Department's own
little Santa Claus. So if you need a
mouthpiece for a trombone or even
if you are interested in traveling out
west by train or youjust need a tape
recorder for the weekend, you can
go down to his workshop and get
what you need and a smile
