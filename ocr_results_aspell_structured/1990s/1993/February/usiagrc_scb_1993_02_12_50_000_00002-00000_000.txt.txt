a call at approximately eight o'clock
Thursday morning, Jan. 28, which

FacilitiesManagementrightnow
has no clear policy on how to dispose
with wild animals Somehow trapped
on campus. According to Michael
Burt,AssociateDirectorandGrounds
Director, in this particular case the
punishment was levied not so much
because the workers had killed the
animal, but because of the manner
and location in which they had cho
sen to do it. “This was clearly not the
way we want our employees to con-

duct themselves around students,”
said Burt.

Facilities Management has to
deal with many animals such as bats
or birds trapped in rooms or build-
ings. Cats, of course, are always let
go, but other animals are sometimes
killed. Mr. Burt said that he and his
colleagues often have a hard time
Judging the possible reactionsofstu-
dcnts. Some, he says, see the animals
as pests and just want them extermi-
natcd, whilc othcrs would prefer to
see them letgc. Therefore. “the gen-
cral policy is to keep a low profile."

According to President
Ferguson, Facilities Management is
in the process of writing a policy to
govern future incidents of this type.
“01' course we’re not too proud of

By Kendra Ford

HIS ismystory,whatelsecan
I I write,” explained Jyl Lynn
Felman to a full audience in
South Lounge Thursday night. Ms.
Fclman explained herprojcct,“lscck
toexplodethcboundarycfthepagc."
Ms. Fclman tried to explain why
she is a Jewish Lesbian Vegetarian
Chicken Writer. The oral tradition
of the Jewish people is imponant in
Ms. Flcman’s writing. She joked,
both in conversation and in her 5107
ries, about the arguments and tradi-
tionsoflewishhouseholds.i-lerlew—
ish heritage explains why she is a
“chicken” writer: She had to eat
chickenagaintorcmcmberthesmells
of her mother‘s kitchen and her
grandmother’s kitchen.

Ms. Felman explained that
memory is an important element of
thelewish tradition. She saidthatall
of her stories are about remembcra
ing and working out power, another
struggle oftthewish,as wellas thc
Lesbian culture.

She also charged the people of
lsracl wtth not holding on to what
had been learned by such honors as
the holocaust. Ms. Felman said that
Israel had a profound effect on her
art, that they events in lsracl are
always in the backofher mind as she
writes.“lama.lewish LesbtanWriter
in mourning for a people who have
lost the integrity of our Vision,” she
said.

The f irstpicce Ms. Fleman read
was the introduction to her book Ho!
Chicken Wings, which moved around
hei‘koshcr family lifc,and the rebel-

lions and perspectives which that
gave her. The second piece was an
interplay of voices working out the
struggles of lesbianism. The final
piece was an excerpt from a piece
about a woman negotiating her fain-
ily life after coming out.

Following the reading, Ms.
Felman stirred a discussion about
the issues raised in “Voices". The
discussion revolved around the is»
sues ofdiscovcring lesbian love and
included some personal anecdotes.

Ms. Flcman’s stories explored
thecomplicatedeffortofcreatingan
identity in a world full of cultural
and ”life—style" territories.

Ms. Fclman’s talk was jointly
sponsored by the Noun Program in
Women's Studies and Jewish Cul-
tural Affairs.
