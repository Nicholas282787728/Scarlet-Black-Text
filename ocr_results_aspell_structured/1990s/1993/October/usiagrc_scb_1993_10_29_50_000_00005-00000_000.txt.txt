Grinnell is not that Small, Really!

Rtva Sharples

rlnnell is in the lniddle of no
where." “There's nothing
to do here.” These two exr

pressrons are probably the most cxr
claimed and overexaggcrated lines
used on campus. But before you
complain,t2lkeitfrom me: compared
to my hometown, Grlnnell is a thrive
ing metropolis, a center of bustling
cuvityandlife. Sulroundedonbolh
sides by Iowa City and Des Moines
nd a relatively short distance from
hicago, the possibilities atGrinnell
eem endless, at least in my View.
If you truly want to visit a place
where there is nothing to do, take a
cad trip to my hometown —
akonda, South Dakota, population
314 beforethe snowbirds departeach
inter. The town‘s two-block main
treetsportsanauctioneer business.a
e “general store“ (containing ev~
rything from baby formula to farm
» achinery and supplies to clothing
nd toys), a library open for four
hours every Saturday, a school that
- ucates kindergarten through twelfth
adeinthesamebuilding,twobeauty
~alons,apostofl‘ice,abank,twobars,
a nd one convenience store, as well as
n ever»growing number of empty
nd vacated buildings.
The hot hang-out spot for teen-
.gers and young adults is “The Pit,”
r bar located in the basement of an

old stone hotel. Ithltlk there may still
be one room available for rent, but
I’m notsure. The two or thrcc“char-
actors” of Wakonda, like “Pepsi,”
make their permanent rc5ldence tn
the hotel.

Forfun, students drive around in
theircars. Itdoesn'ttakevcry long to
speed down the sixrblock residential
“district," whip a quick Urturn on
main street, and fly down the other
side of the Schct, but you would be
amazed at the number of hours that
can be occupied doing this. The real
challenge (and excitement) comes
during the winter when snow and ice
make it difficult to stop at the single
stop sign on main street.

Excitement is at its highest “1
Wakonda when wedding dances and
the annual hunter‘s feed is held at the
Legion Hall, located right across the
street from my house. Wandering
back and forth between the Pit and
the Legion Hall (right through our
yard no less). inebriated individuals
can provide hours of am usement and
entertainment if one stands in the
shadows of my porch with a good
pair of binoculars.

Gossiping is probably the most
cherished activity in Wakonda. If
you get up at 7 am, you canjoin the
local farmers gathered down at the
convenience store and drink coffee,
eat donuts (imported from the large
town of 12,00010cated 23 miles away)

and gossip. On a really warm ITlOm’
ing, you could join the women in
front of the postoffice, or. ifits cold,
insitletheslnalllobby,whereyoucan
talk and gossip about the HOSplL’ll
News and Funeral notes listed by our
postmaster daily.

If you can think of something to
do, you can do it in Wakonda. Tllerc
are no cops and the sheriff is miles
away, so legal or illegal activity, it
doesn’t matter in Wakonda. Breakr
ing into abandoned buildings, lying
In thetniddle ofthc streetpretending
they were the“lost boys,” and having
“pasture" parties (keg parties held
out in the middle ofa ﬁeld to escape
detection from roaming police), have
all been activttics that occupied my
peers at one time or another.

It you want to see a movie, you
must drive 23 miles in one direction
to Yankton (pop. 12,0(X)) or you can
travel in the opposite direction to
Vennillion,alown of9,000. Forbig
cultural events, you can travel 60
miles to the largest city in South
Dakota: Sioux Falls, population
100,000.

50, the next time you believe
yourself stuck in the middle of “no
where Iowa," think about planning a
trip to even more dmolale and iso-
lated Wakonda, South Dakota. You
just might change your mind about
Grinnell.

Grinnellians Help
with Flood Relief
over Fall Break

By Howard B Horn

0 now, fall break is over. For
S some Grinnell students, this

mmtgoinghomc,dealingwith
mom and dad, and feeling lonely be
cause all their friends are sull away at
school. Forother students, this meant
going on a trip and spending all the
money from the paycheck they earned
by laboring at Cowles. Still others
stayed in the dorms and got caught up
on the enormous amount of work
they’ve been putting off for fall break
(yeah, right). All of these endeavors
had one common theme: they were all
unproductive.

Eleven Grinnell sludcnlsdccided
not to take the “normal” approach to
fall break. Instead, these students de-
cided to helppeople in the Des Moines
area by participating in Alternative
Break, sponsored by the Community
Service Organization.

The students worked for several
organizations dealing with Hood relief
and homelessness. Rather than sitting
infrontoftheT.V.orsleeping tillthree
in the aflemoon. these students helped
rake leaves. organize a clothes pantry
for homeless people, dig trenches for
the foundations to ﬂooded homes,and
paint and drywall,

After the stress of two months of

a Grinnell rigorous education, why do
more work? Virginia McDaniel, a
Grinncll sophomore who participated
in the projccl explained, “I think that
community service is a good thing to
do. People still need help with the
flood and other things. I think it was a
better idea than doing nothing athome
and not getting a lot accomplished."

The students who participate in
the Alternative Break enjoyed it. Ac-
cording to McDaniel,juniorJess Olson
expressed interest in becoming a doc—
tor for one organiwlion the students
worked for calledPoople First. People
First was started by an ex-football
player who established the organiza-
tion after he and his daughter saw the
devastation of Hun-icane Andrew on
T.V. People First worked wiLh the Red
Cross in Honda with Hurricane An-
drew survivors and in Iowa with ﬂood
relief.

Unlike most students‘ fall break,
the students who participated in Alter-
native Break did something produc»
tive. “Everylittle bithelps,”McDaniel
said. “One person can'tdoeverything,
but they can make a small difference.
I don‘t know if] enriched anyone’s
life, but I know the people I helped
enriched mine.”
