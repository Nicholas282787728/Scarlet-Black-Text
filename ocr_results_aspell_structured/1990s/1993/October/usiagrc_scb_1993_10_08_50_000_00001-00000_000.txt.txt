Open Immigration is Favored
2—1 by a Grinnell Audience

R1va Sharples

MERICA wants the “tired,

poor,and huddled masses,"

of other countries, voted a
majority of Grinnellians at a parlia-
mentary debate held Tuesday in the
Forum. Sponsored by the Grinnell
Debating Union and Amnesty Inter-
national, the debate focused on the
current US immigration policy for
economic refugees.

Thcproposiuon’s mainargument
fornotwantingeconomicrefugeesto
come into America was Lhat it was
ultimately not in the main inlerestof
the refugee.

“The current immigration laws
were made to appease industry and
big business in America,” argued
KristinJensen,“Nottoappwsethose
whom they affect most.”

The reason that Americans are
so eager to admit economic refugees
is for cheap labor, she said.

“We should stop drawing immi-
grants from poor countries to sponge
off their cheap labor,“ Jensen said.

In the past decade, under the
open-doorpolicyofReaganandBush,

the number of immigrants coming
into America swelled 40 percent,
Jensen said. One of the constant
problems caused by this Overwhelmr
ing influx is the condition of public
schools today, she said.

”The school system in Dade
County, Florida, is registering 755
new immigrant students per month.
At this rate, it‘s virtually impossible
for any teacher or school system to
keep up. And this is only a case in
point. Immigration is not the way to
help poorand huddled masses. Ifwe
really want to help them, we should
go to the poor countries and help
there.“

Butgoing to poor countries will

hesatd. “Immigrants don‘tchooscto
be poor in their countries. And if
things were great there. they would
stay. But they aren’t staying. The
opposition believes that to push
people away from America because
they are poor is wrong. All people
should have a chance to dream.”

American corporations are not

“sponging off immigrants." Axtell
said.

“The US govemmentesmblishes
a minimum wage so that this can’t
happen."

But letting dozens after dozens
ofimmigrants into the countryis in a
way cruel and irresponsible, said Alec
Zamouline, who spoke for the propo—
sition. Once here, immigraan dis—
cover that they can’t survive any beta
ter than they did in their home coun-
Lries, he said.

“Most immigrants live in large
citiesandinsideevcry firstworld city
is alhird world city." saidZamoulinc.
”There is only one party who really
beneﬁts from all theimmigralion and
that's the rich American industry.”

To back up his argument,
Zamoullnecited the factthatAmerica
is more accepting ofskilled and edur
catedimmigrants,and,inreality,does
not really care about the poor and
huddled masses.

“America says a greatbig wel-
comelotheskilled workers andatiny
little welcome to the poor."

If Americans really want to help
poor immigrants, they would do bet-
