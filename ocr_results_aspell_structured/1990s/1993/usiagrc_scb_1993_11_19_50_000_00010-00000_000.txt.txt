Open Letter to the Campus Commu-
nity: Students, Faculty, Staff,
Friends...

It is time-no. way past timerio
put our cards on the table.
afcwfacts:

The Human Immunodefi-
ciency Birus (I-IIV) is known to cause
AIDS(AcquiredlmmunoDeficiency
Syndrome), which is still fatal.

-I-IIV is transmitted through:
Direct sexual contact, Bodily ﬂuids
(exceptsaliva),Birth,Drugparapherr
nalia(needles,syringes,cookers,and
cottons).

-The window period (the time
between contact with the virus and
you body‘s reaction to it in the forin
of detectableantibodies) isanywhere
from lhreetosix months. This means
that testing before at least three
months after contact is unreliable.

-The time from acquiring HIV
and the development of AIDS symp-
toms averages ten and one-halfyears.
(it is unkown how long the virus can
remain in the system before develop-
ing AIDS.)

-Grinnell is no sanctuary. Sexu-
ally active young adults are a high-
risk group. Statistically speaking,
therefore, Grinnell is infected.
people are still having sex:

Okay. We know we have sex.
Not necessarily everybody in our
community does so, but if you are
one of the many who are sexually
active, you are atn'sk. You may only
have been exposed once. That may
be theonly time you've ever had sex.
That’s all it lakes. And, even if that
partner tests negative, you may still
test positive.

Grinnell is a small community
whose members are highly sexually
active. This means that if any one of
our members has HIV (a statistical
probability), the chances of an epi-
demic are incredible. It’s called the
AIDS Weh,and we all get tangled up
in it by being stupid.

Theproblemisthatnoonewants
to admitdlat: “People aresttll having

La Tour. This means that,along with
abstinence, other measures need to
be available for the prevention ofthe
impending epidemic.

Perhaps more condom ma-
chines? The laundry room machines
are often empty, which lends crc~
dence to the claim of frequent sexual
activity. More machines might be
conveniently located in Bob‘s Un-
derground, The Forum, and the Hill”

ris Center. [The Harris Center is
particularly good given the strong
connectionbetweenalcoholandsex.)

Free and anonymous resting in
Grinnell? This scrviceis availablein
IowaCityand in Des Moincs,bulthe
privtleged few who have cars (or
access thereto) and no classes during
testinghourscan takcadvantagcofit.
In Grinnell, it IS neither free nor
anonymous, Two years ago, it cost
$70 for testing and counseling and it
is confidential, not anonymous.

What we’re asking here is not
expensive or intensive. A counselor
(both before and after testing) and a
nurse to draw the blood are all that’s
required. With the proper training, it
could be the same personal] that’s
required is AIDS/HIV counselor
Llaining. Grinnell college can afford
this, and if an epidemic is to be
avoided, we must afford it.
safe sex.-

As far as we know, the only sure
way to prevent the transmission of
HIV through direct sexual contact is
no direct sexual contact involving the
exchange ofbodily ﬂuids containing
HIV: semen, vaginal fluids, blood.
This means that, included in safe
forms of sex are: masturbation.
frotlage (rubbing body parts), masr
sage, hugging, cuddling and fanta-
sizing. In general, hands are safe
unless you have open cuts or sores.
Your own bodily ﬂuids will not hurt
you.

However, latex condoms and
dental dams have been shown to
greatly reduce the risk of HIV trans-
mission. Obviously, then, if you are
interested in bodily fluidrtype sex,
you should trycondoms. (Since den-
Ial dams, which are directed toward
oral sex, are difficult to acquire here,
Saran Wrap is a viable substitute.)

My plea for you is this: practice
safesex. Talktoeach other. Fight for
better protection. Get more informa
tion. This is not meant as an exhaus-
livellstofeverythingthcreistoknow
about HIV, AIDS, and YOU. Use
your brain-that's what it's therefore:-
ifyou can’t talk to them, don’t trust
them with you life. There is no "just
once" with AIDS. There is no tumr
ing back.

To the Editor:

“The Faculty Development Comr
mittee recommends replacing the
current system of S.E.P.C. inter
views.. with a letter from the
Dean, Onlyttheanandlhcl’rcsi—
dcntwill see the full letter from each
student. An edited version (with all
identifiers deleted) will be available
to the faculty memberuntlcrrcview,
to the tenured members of the dc-
partment, to the Executive Council,
and to the S.E.P.C.”

These are excerpts from a letter
received by allfacultyin April, I993.
As liaisons between the faculty and
students, we the representatives of
the S.E.P.C.s (Student Educational
Programming Committee) feel that

it ls our duty to bring this matter to
your attention. Currently, at Grin-
nell College student input is an im—
portant part of the faculty review
process. The presentsystem SOIiCIlS
student opinion through a series of
student administered interviews.
Data is then compiled and presented
by theS.E.P.C.slo departmental fac-
ulty.

We fear that in its attempt to
streamline the revtew process, the
above recommendation may in fact
create a system in which student
input is indirect at best. While at
present, students collect and evalu-
ate studentinput, ifilnplcmentcd the
above process would require that
student concerns be filtered through
