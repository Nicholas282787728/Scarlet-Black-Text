him to his joyful state, and proves
that no one person can dictate what is
beneficial to everyone.

The parlictpanls in this produc-
tion of ”Eric Hermannson’s Soul"
come from all over Iowa. The con-
ductor Linda Brand is afﬁliated with
the Des Memes opera, and the cast
includes Scott McCoy from the Uni~
versity of Iowa, as well as Jean
McDonald and John Stuh-
Rommerein, Several Grinnell stu~
dents, faculty and alumni are also
involved with the opera, including
PipGordanandJonalhan Knight,who
is producing Lhe show.

This opera, Chenette feels, is
ideal for“anyonewho has never seen
an opera." The lively libretto and
dancing give the production a light
hearted tone, and there are plenty of
romantic as well as some scary parts
that should provide something for
any viewer.
