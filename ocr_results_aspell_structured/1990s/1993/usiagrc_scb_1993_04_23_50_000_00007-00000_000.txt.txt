O’Reilly and Associates of
Sebastopol, California is staging the
contest to promote its recent publica
tion of SMILEYS by David
Sanrlerson's, a directory of over 650
“computer smileys,” also called
“emoticons."

A “smiley" is a typographical
icon commonly atlachedtoelectronic
mail messages, erg. z—l. They are
”sideways expressions ofbasic emo-
lions,adialectspokenthroughoutthe
eyberspace underground," as defined
by the book’s publisher.

"it is entirely appropriate that
the ubiquitous symbol of the 1970’s
pop culture, the black-oneyellow
smiley face, should be adopted and
adapted by a thriving culture of the
1990’s, networked computer users,"

a promotional news release asserts.
“Reeling from VietnamandWatcrgalc,

ask, ‘Can we talk?”

Smileys have evolved quickly
from the basic smiley, allowing the

grown out of the high speed and in
formal tone of electronic communi-
cation, which he says is closer to
having a telephoneconversation than

Sanderson comments that each
e-mail exchange is only one piece of
acontinuingconversation,andpoints
out the high risk for potential mise
communication.Fromwatchingelec-
tronic bulletin boards from all over

on the VAX here at Grinncll,
Sanderson observes, ”The context of
an electronic conversation evolves
rapidly, suddenly including new
people and new perspectives. You

often need to rely on personal expres-
siou, smileys, to make up for any
misunderstandings."
