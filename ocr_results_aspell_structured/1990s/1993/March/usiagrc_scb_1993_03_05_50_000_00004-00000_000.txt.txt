BILL
SMILES

ByToleabinger

WHILE on the ground al'ler tall-
ing, Bill noticed something. A
smell. What is that smell?

Lying on the ground in the
grass Bill felt like he was in a
pool of ecstasy. The air he in
haled tingled the lining of his
lungs. Din. Grass. Flowers.
Bees. Birds. Wetness. Mud.

Billthen rolled overand saw
the beautiful spring sky and the
warm sun above him and a grin
of joy appeared on his face.

IPI Int’l Fellows venture to state capitol

By Nejdiah Zaidi

THEIowaIntemaijonachllows
Program sponsored by the
Iowa Peace Institute gives a
select group of international students
the opportunity to learn about Iowa
and the Midwest outside their aca
demic setting. Furthermore, the pro-
gram recognizes and honors the im-
portance of intentational student leadr
ets in Iowa as a resource in develop-
ingrelau'onshipswiththeircountrics.

This year the Iowa International
Fellows Program has fifty—seven stu-
dents from twenty—one colleges/uni;
vcrsitics from all over Iowa. These
participants represent tltirtyrthree
different countries. In a series of
monthly field trips held during the
academic year, the students come
together with experts from Iowa to
discuss topics such as business, me,
dia, agriculture, human services and
government. On February 22, a field
trip focusing on govemmentwas held
at the State Capitol in Des Moines.

The [PI Int’l fellows reached the
State Capitol building at 10 am. For
thosewhodon’tknow,theStateCapi»
tol building is the impressive, 100
year old architectural structure with
two gold domes. Most everyone
passes this building when visiting
Des Moines,but few have thechance
to stop by and look inside.

The interiorofthc Capitol build-
ing is as beautiful as the exterior.
High ceilings, long winding stair-
cases, marblepaneling, and old signs
hanging over office entrances cre»
ated art aura around me. For a mo-
ment, I thought I was in one of the
palaces in India.

The first item on the agenda was
attending a joint session of Demo-
crats and Republicans in the House

of Representatives Chamber. The
session started with a prayer, after
which the membersprocccded to their
assigned seats The speaker called
the House to order, and the session
convened. A new member was sworn
in as a State Representative.

The IPI lnt’l Fellows were given
a very warm welcome A State Repre»
scnlative stoodupand talked abouttltc
IPI Int’l Fellows forashortiimc, intror
ducing us to the Chamber as It group
and having us stand up so that every-
one could see the IPI Int’l Fellows. We
received a standing ovation.

It was the mostexciting moment

in my life. i felt. like Bcnazir Bhutto
(lst woman cxrprimc minister of
Pakisuin), when she got a standing
ovation in the U.S. Congresst Thcsc
gestures displayed goodwill towards
inlcrnauonalsludcnls,whichzillofus
will take back to our respective
countries.

After lunch, State Representar
tivcsDennisBlack,DonHanson,Bob
Arnold, Elaine Baxter and Don
Avenson spoke with the IPI Int’l Fclr
lows about the representatives' roles
in the House Chamber. All of the
representatives were very friendly and
eager to answer any questions. They

puta lot of time and effort into mak-
ing thell’l Int’chllows feelcornforl-
able, and saw that they left the State
Capitol with good memories. The
Representatives did not have to be so
attentive but they were, and we ap-
preciatcdit. On the whole. I came out
from the State Capitol more knowl-
edgeable and more appreciative of
American hospitality.

There are internship opportuni
ties available at the State Capitol for
academic credit. Ten to fifteen inr
tems from college campuses in Des
Moincs, Iowa City, and Grinnell are
hosted at one time.

Conservation efforts stalled

By Craig Hooper

CE PRESIDENT of College

g I Services Waldo Walker rind

Associate Director of Facili-

ties Management Phillip Schupbach,

areteniativelyplotting Grinnell‘sconr
servation course.

“It’s a difﬁcult problem,” said
Schupbachi “In our ofﬁce we tend to
think first of facilities and second of
the students. Asaforrnereducatorl try
to remind myself ihatthe education of
the siudentis why weare here, and ifit
came down to whether I wanted to
retrofitlighting in Burling or wccould
buy computers for Burling, I would
say buy the computers. On the other
hand, you may have the money 10 buy
the computers next year if you save
thS year on energy conservation."

Another constraint is the issue of
long-term return on investments. The
college Will not fund projects iliatlakc
longer titan five years to become prof-
it'iblet “One of the biggest problems

concerning energy altruism is when
youopcratcabusincss oran institution
like this you don’t very often consider
things with any longer payback of
probably ten years,“ said Walker.
“Most issues we look at are now lim-
itedby ‘don’t bring itto us ifyoudon't
have something less than a six year
payback.w

New buildings also come with
their share of new conservation inno-
vations, but they are often cut as the
buildings go over budget. Both
Schupbach and Walker agree that en-
ergy conservation is nota high priority
in the construction and remodeling of
the college’s buildings

According to Walker, sacrifice to
improve energy efficiency utGrinncll
is nothing new. During the energy
crisis of 1974775, Grinncll was forced
to acquire additional oil storage capacA
ity to weather tntermittent gas service.

“We also developed a conserva—
tion program for lights, conservation
ofheat, and the setting backofthcmtor
stats,” Said Walker. “We did have scl-

backs in heat, and we worked very
diligently on them, When the students
left campus at Christmas Break we
wentinto those residence halls and cut
the tcmpcratureback as fares we dared
to gowithoutjoopardizing frozen pipes
and things like that. WeactuaUy posted
stickers on all the light switches on cam
pus, saying ‘please turn this light 0

Since then, “fatigue set in,” and
theprogram wasdiscontinued. ”Iihink
the community worked at energy con-
servation until the crunch got over, and
then it was hard for people to look
ahead far enough to the long range
serious energy problems we're going
tobcfacingtomakc themselves incon—
venicncod by having to shut off the
lighls every time they leave the room
or by getting up in the morning and
having the temperature in their resi»
dcnce hall room an 62 degrees.”

“At the present time,” continued
Walker, “people are using at least as
much energy as they were using when
we instituted our 1974775 energy con-
scrvaiion program.”
