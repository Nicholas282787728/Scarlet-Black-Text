presented tonight and tomor-

row at 7:00 p.m. tn the Flanagan

Arena Theme. The play, orginoted

by junior Shea Nangle, is a sequel to

Samuel Beckett’s Wailing for Godot,

and reveals what happens when Godot

arrives Although devoid of actors,

L’arrt‘ve’e contains lights, sounds,

icons and audience. While the begin-

ning and end of the play are pre—
determined, spectators decidc what
occurs in the middle. Co-director

Nangle emphasized the importance

of the audience by describing the

play as a“post»linguist.ic experimen-
tal theatre piece which is fully audi-
ence participatory,"

The stage lightsare mostly blue.
the Collective's favorite color. Pro-
duction staff member Muttt Huang
described the sounds, provided by
Nine InchNails, Debbie Harry, Min-
istry, and FredericChopin, as an “ex-
pressionisticcollageof real andimag—

incd pieces combined with the true
essence of Beckett’s definition of
cxptanauon." Nanglc classified the
icons, of which one is “the ultimate
symbol of the lack of communicar
lion." as modern.

The Ground State Collective
consists of sophomores Muttt, Amy
Smith and Dawn Klingele, and co»
directors Nangle and senior Amihan
Huesmann. Smith, who cordircctcd
thefallproductionolADoll'sﬂouse,
is the only member of the group with
directing experience,

Samuel Beckett’s work has not
been produced by Grinnell students
since Fall 1989, when Ellen Mcasc
offered Endgame and Juliet Willis
presented a series of oncracts. The
Ground Stale Collective decided to
do Beckcll because they consider his
work to be an exercise in drinking.
Huesmann explained: “Beckett did
stuff and sat by and watched while
people tried to figure out what the
hell he was Lrying to do.”

Tickets will be available at the
door. The play is about twenty min-
utes long.
