Softball Drops Four Games

by Doug Hodum

 

 

HE Grinnell College softball team has four games this week,
hosting Cornell yesterday and travelling to Knox tomorrow. The
team hopes to improve its record and shake its batting slump.
After hitting well in previous games, the Pioneers struggled at the
plate last week. “Regardless of what the other learn did, we were not
scoring ,“ said Coach Lori Sadewater. AgainstCoc on Monday, Sadewater
said they faced “an outstanding sophomore pitcher." Freshman Nicole
Wendt managed the only hit for Gi-lnnell in a 12-0 defeat Coe won the
second game, 12-2, allowing only three singles in five innings.
Although the results againstlllinoisCollege were the same, two losses
by 164) and 10-0, the team did manage to play their “bestdefense in along
time." Sadewater praised freshman Bmky Fidelman for her “best game at
Gi-innell,” freshman Daeey Waldron who had an “excellent second game
at shonstop,” and sophomore pitcher Andrea Leonard for coming out and
throwing strikes in some difﬁcult situations. A high point offensively for
Grinnell was Tera Jones’ triple in the second game.
Although Sadewater says“it has been a frustrating season," she hopes
her players can prevent any fuiure letdowns and stay intense in their
upcoming games.
