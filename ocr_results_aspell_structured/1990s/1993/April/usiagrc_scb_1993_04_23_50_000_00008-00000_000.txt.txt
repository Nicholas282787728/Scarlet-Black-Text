slower‘Didn'tEven Notice',.,wiLha
few surprises along the way.

Liquid Pearl‘s Lounge Tour has

energized the music scene atGrinncll.
They posted their entire tour schedule
early in Febnlary to allevlalc perfor-
mance conﬂicts with other bands—a
common problem last semester.

from off campus to perform at Grin-
nell. Sweat Lodge, from Wartburg
Collegc,j0mcht'quid[’earlinGardner
for the first Lounge Tour show.

Leach stated a basic desire for
more experience as the main reason
for doing Tour ’93. However, the
tour also provided opportunities to
play for different types ofaudiences,
“from the rowdy SwearLodge fans at
Gardner to the small group of friends
at Haines.”

Members ofLiqlu’dPearl would
like to thank all the people who have
attended their shows and who have
made the Lounge Tour ’93 wonh-
while.
