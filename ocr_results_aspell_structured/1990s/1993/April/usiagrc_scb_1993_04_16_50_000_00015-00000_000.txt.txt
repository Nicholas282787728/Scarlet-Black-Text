Softball plays Illinois College
and Grand View this weekend

by Douglas Hodum

 

 

l-DE Grinnell College softball team has a week of difficult

games, facing the defending Midwest Conference champions

Coe on Monday in Cedar Rapids before playing home games
against Teikyo Marycrest on Wednesday and Illinois College on
Saturday. The Pioneers may also host Grant! View on Sunday to make
up for the postponed game of last week.

Despite one rainrout this past week, the Pioneers managed to get a
doubleheader in Saturday against Monmouth. In the opener Grinnell
was plagued by walks and en‘ors, losing 1775. Monmouth scored its runs
on 13 walks, six errors and 13 hits. However, the Pioneers did very well
at the plate, going 11 for 32 with four players 2 for 4. Senior Lisa York,
junior Meghan White and freshmen Dacey Waldron and Kendra Potz
each had two hits. Three doubles, coupled with a triple by Potz, the
team’s designated player produced the best inning in the first game. In
the second game Monmouth won, 1171. Once again mistakes plagued
the Pioneers, who made three en'ors and had seven walks.

Coach Lori Sadewater said the team was “hitting well and on the
ball", but that the team “just did not get any breaks.“ The hitting, led by
seniors Tera I ones and Lisa York, who each went 3 for 7, improved the
team‘s batting average from .224 to .233, The performance at the plate
shows potential for the team's upcoming games. Sadewater continues to
hope that with each game, the players all learrt something new.
