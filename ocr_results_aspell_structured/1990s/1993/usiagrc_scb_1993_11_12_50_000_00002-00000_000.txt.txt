werealsoinvcstigatjngwho hadmade
the call. Because the time ofthe call
was known, the police were able to
once the call through the telephone
switchboard and determined that the
call had come from a hall phone in
Younker Dorm. The recording of the
call was Lhcn played for a group of
Younker students and the Younker
RLC.

“The RLC and some students in
the dorm thought they had identified
the student from the sound of the
voice," said Duke.

The student requested the our
vice of legal counsel before making
any statement to the police, accord-
ing to Frank Thomas, Special Assis-
tant to the President. Afterconsultar
tion with legal counsel, the person
cooperated with the police. saidThor
mas,

As a result of their initial ques»
tioning, the police believed that the
entire incident was a misunderstand-
ing.

“Basically, (the incident)
stemmed from a misunderstanding
between two people that were talk-
ing,”saidPairolman Dave Sears “One
person was a little frustrated with
school, having troubles with a paper
that was due, andjust basically made

divided,“ and simply, “Women take
back the night!" According to stalls»
tics, the majority of survivors of
sexualassaultare women, men there
fore did notparticipate in the march,
but took part in a discussion in North
Lounge.

Gretchen Johanns, one of the
organizers of the event, said , “Women
Take Back the Night is about em-
powennent. Itis what thename says:
‘taking back the night.’ We march to
reclaim the dark, scary parts of our
communities. it is the one night a
yearwhen womencanwalk,atnighr,

the Comment. ‘I could blow up the
(science building)’. The other per
son took it as it could have been
literal orcould havebeen factual and
reported it to us."

No charges have been filed. said
Sears.

“They haven‘t done anything
wrong at this point," he said. ”it
wasn't the intention ofthe first party
to causethc secondparty to call us. If
that had been the case, then we could
have charged either or both parties."

Yet questions still remain and
the investigation continues.

“We‘re still investigating," said
Acting Police Chief Darrel Lamb.
“We don’t know for sure (if it was a
misunderstanding). That’s what we
were initially led to believe. There is
a possibility that charges could be
ﬁled."

Policeandcollegeofficialshave
been in close contact during the past
week, according to Seats.

“At all of our interviews and
everything, with theexceptjon of one
interview, there were college person-
nel present," said Sears. “(I)t’s not

ldte we’re trying to hold anything
from them or them from us."

College officials present a dif-
fercnt view of Friday's events.

Crady siatedthaihis understand-
ing was that the policebelievcacrilnc
occurred and that they are investigat-
ing it now.

“We believe 2i bomb threat was
made,” Said Cratly. “1 don't think
there is any question about that in our
minds at this point.”

Thomas indicated thatcollcgc and
policeotﬁcialssuspected lhestudcnts’
claim of a misunderstanding as early
as Friday evening,

“Friday evening, things didn’t
really click.” said Thomas. “And we
started drinking that something else
mightbe going on, that the statement
made before by the student was incor-
rect. (And that) the person making the
phone call had created the whole event
in thatpcrson’s mind. So the policenrc
now investigating has a crime."

Thomas added that the student
who made the call had an exam that
afternoon in the Science Building for
