punk/pop/rock sound that has elicited .

comparisons to Nirvana and early
Teenage Fanclub, the four-year-old
quartet has released three albums on
Touch and Go Records.

The most recent of these albums
was a singles compilation titled Torr-
irtg Seeds The CD documents every
thing from Superchunk‘s very his
recordings, made one friend‘s Struck,
through their latest work.

“We're Still moving ahead," said
guitanst/lcadvocalisthtc McCaughn
in a 1992 interview. “1 think if you
piaythe two versions of ‘CastIron' [on
Tossing Seeds], you can see how far

bers are: Laura Ballanoe on bass: Jim
Wilbur. guitar, and Jon Wurswr, drums.

Ballance, especially. hasachieved
fameon the underground music scene.
The subject of the New York band
Surgery’s song “Dear Sweet Laura,"
and often called “The Julia Roberts of
the Underground," Ballance first met

ExpectMcCaughn’s vocals tobe
muffledatbcst. “That‘s deliberate. I
don't think of the voice as anything
more than a founh instrument. [think
of [lyrics] in the same way as I think of
guitar chords, just a part of the song,"
McCaughn has said. “One thing the
iyricsaren’tispolitical. There'snothr
ing particularly that I’m bitter about,"

McCaughn doesn’t believe his
lack of bitterness impedes
Superchunk’s ability to produce rav-
agingpunk music,however. ”There is
some fnistration, but [it’s mostly dealr
ing with] being irritated with people
who aren’t doing anything.”

Superchunk has been courted by
hnutnbcrefmajorlttbcls,suchnsCBS
anti Warner Bros, but chooses to re-

main on Touch and Go to ensure their
musical freedom and independence.

In concert, the group was de-
scribed in England’s New Music Ex,
presras‘Sonic Youth-ish [in concert],
with the inﬂuence of hardcore muss
cling up againstelements of new wave
simplicity."

Hitchcock Fest
Continues With
Espionage Classic

NE moment she was sit-
ting there, plump, ma-
tronly, reading a needle

work magazine.

The next, she was gone, and
the young woman with her in the
train compartment, waking from a
nap. was told by fellow passengers
that there had been nosuch woman.
She knew there had been; they had
been together in the station as well
as in the compartment.

Yet, it didn’t seem quite cred-
ible that everyone on the train had
entered into a conspiracy—a con-
ductor, dining room stewards, a
countess, a noted surgeon, at music
hall performer, a nun, and two
cricketrmad Englishmen among
them. And there’s the puzzle of
Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Van-
ishes, starring Margaret Lockwood
and Michael Redgrave.

Sight &. Sound commented.
“Hitchcock has said that he wanted
his films to achieve a particular
blend of drama and comedy, and
that he found The Lady Vanishes
one of the most satisfying in this
respect."

TheNewYorkﬁmersaid,“Ifit
were not so brilliant a melodrama,
we should class it as a brilliant
comedy.”

as he or she tries to outguess the
Master of Intrigue, TheLady Van-
t'sher is one of Hitchcock's earlier
ﬁlms, from the British period.

Please note change in time and
place: Wednesday, November 24,
8:00 pm. in the Nonh Lounge of
