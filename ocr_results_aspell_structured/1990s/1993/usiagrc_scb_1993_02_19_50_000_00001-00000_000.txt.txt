that the college has failed to recognize

KDIC Reopens for Spring

Kashuba initiates more formal procedures to conform to FCC regulations

By Julie C. Pecaut

HE legal and structural problems which

I prompted KDIC to close down last semester

have been resolved, according to station man-

ager Adam Kashuba. Since lastsemester, KDIC has

caught up with FCC regulations, formalized proce»

dures in a staff manual, and positioned itself as a
“cutting edge” radio station.

“It was like playing telephone," said Kashuba of

KDIC’s previous management. “All the things the

incoming station manager needed to do were basically

 

passed down by word of mouth from the previous
station manager, and in the translation, things got lost.”

When Student Affairs hired anew chief engineer
for KDIC last semester, he pointed out numerous
FCC regulations that had gotten lost in this transla»
tion. These included the failure to receive, log, and
send an Emergency Broadcast System(EBS) test, a
station license which was missing, and DJ operator’s
licenses which were not posted,

“When changing an organization that is this
complex, you run into alot of stutnbling blocks,“ said
Kashuba,commenting on the problems last semester.

Administration establishes
permanent language houses

Student housing committee sidestepped

By Sharyn Obsatz

DECISION by Dean 13me-
A dents Tom Crady to estab
lish five permanent lan-
guage houses on a three-year trial
basis has been seen by many students
as a faculty and administration coup.
The decision, described by both
Crady and students as “arbitrary,”
will take out ofthe housing pool five
of the ten college—owned houses cur-
rently open [0 students. The language
departments must fill the houses to
minimum capacity before the hous-
ing deadline of April 9 or the houses
will be available forother applicants.
Crady made the decision to es-
tablish the houses’without consulting
the Housing Committee, composed
primarily of students, or its chair,
housing director Oda Callison. The
\Committee opposed establishing per-
manent language houses, preferring
that language houses be formed by
student initiative

years,” Crady told students at a
Wednesday‘s Joint Board meeting.
“I’m notpleased with the way I made
the decision, but I made the right
decision,“ Crady said.

“Students will have the ultimate
control. If they don‘t sign up for the
houses, they won’t exist," he said.

Faculty say permanent houses,
which they have wanted for more
than ten years, will provide an aca-
demicallyemcial“linguisticenviron~ _
ment” for language students. Ger-
man professor Petra Perry says the
uncertainty of getting a house widt
the present system discourages lan-
guage students from trying,

“It’s like reinventing the wheel
each year,” said Russian professor
and associate dean Helen Scotti She
said permanent houses will allow
departments to “build up long-range
interest in these houses.”

Crady said it was these faculty
arguments that convinced him to

move forward

through the regular “Students had nothingto with the houses

housing application dowith thisdecision—
notonebit."

process.

Some students
say they are angered
more over the way the decision was
made than the decision itself. They
question how much relative inﬂu~
ence students and faculty should have
over student life.

“Students had nothing to do with
this decisioninotonc bit,” said com
mittee member senior Ion Willis. “It
made us wonder what the role of the
Housing Committee is if we can't
inﬂuence the way housing goes.”

“It was one of those situations in
which student and faculty were at
odds, and unless a decision was made,

this year. Estab-
lishing perma-

recommendedbyoutsideconsultants
and by college dean Charles Duke,
who told Crady in a letter last No-
vember, “We need to begin planning
now so that we can have permanent
language houses in place at the be-
ginning of the next academic yeart"
The designated language houses
include 1019 Park, 1023 Park, 1316
Park. and 1130 East, and 916-18 6th
Avenue. Student affairs reduced the
occupancy requirement for two of
these houses by one person in order
