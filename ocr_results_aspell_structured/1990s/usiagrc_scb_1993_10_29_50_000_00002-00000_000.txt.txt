through and that concerns me. There
are so many questions being left un-
answered. Frcc trade is a women’s
issue and I haven‘t heard anyone on
the Hill discussing Lhataspect. How
does it funher eliminate discrimina-
tion toward women? How does it
beneﬁt women and children? These
are valid questions we must as
Panelist Papusa Molina’s main
concern with NAFTA was its racist

and subordinating policies. Molina,
who is the director of the Women‘s

Resource and Action Center at the
University of Iowa. came to the
United States at the age of 30 and has
livedin the Midwestfor twelve years.

“I have a little different perspece
tive than the rest of the panelists." she
said. “I grew up in Mexico. so obvi—

ously 1 have a great concern and love
for that country. "therefore, I am very
suspicious about the free trade agree
ment. Is anyone concerned that the
agreement is more favorable to the
United States than to Mexico? What
about the neocolonialism relationship
this agreement creates? Is Mexico
going to become a more direct colony
of America, like Puerto Rico?"

Technology and its development
in Mexico was another of Molina’s
main concerns. She equated thepos—
sible relationship that might develr
opmcnt to the current lopsided trade
relationship between America and
Japan in the car industry.

“Americans buy alotmore Japa-
nese cars than Japanese buy Amerir
can,” she said. “Will the same hap-
pen to Mexico?"

graduate is a candidate for

Mayor of the City of Grinnell.
Sadler, a native of Mojave, Califor»
nia, graduated from Grinnell in 1988
with a BA. in Economics. Sadler
said he decided to run because, “I
don’t think the current council is ad
dressing all the needs of the city, the
council tends to get divided on baisic
issues and it needs leadership to get
the members to start agreeing and
compromising so that we can solve
some of the basic issues."

Sadler said that the city needs to
improve relations between the col-
lege and the city. “I’ve seen the city
from both perspectives and there is
no reason we can't get along. It's a
matterofcreating programs and situ-
ations where people can get together
and develop respect for each other,"
he said. Sadler added, “It’s imporr
tant that ti message be sent from the
top of the government that all people
