The Cabinet speaks...

Over the past few years, racial tenr
sions on this campus have been cSr
calating. Actions taken by students
ofcolor such as the Spring 1995 pro
test and ASIA‘s Spring 1996 demonr
stration have served to highlight
these tensions and to create dialogue
as well as contention. The rccettt
controversy over an “ad” in The Gltnl
shows that Grinnell Collegc continr
ties to have major problems with race
and ethnicity issues, Tlle Gum “ad"
and the response it provoked from
many concerned
students, as well as
ASIA’s subsequent
response, are evi»
dence that racism
is a problem and a
complicated issue
on our campus.
The Student Gov-
ernment Associa
tion Cabinet sup»
ports the group of students who or-
ganized the October 17th response
to the Gum “ad" as an effort to take
.action against the publication ofracr
ist material that personally offended
and angered many people.

Perhaps the most important ele-
ment in dispelling racism is dialogue.
accompanied by education. it is not
the responsi y ofstudent s of any
race or ethnicity. however, to educate
this campusv'l‘o ask any student to
do so or to be a “representative" or
his or her race is absurd and unfair.
The SGA Cabinet this year has re-
peatedly voiced its commitment to
opening up communication on this
campus: between students and fac-
ulty, between students and the ad-
ministration, between students and
the trustees and among student
groups. SGA also has the responst-
bility to keep open the lines of com-

 

Perhaps the most
important element in
dispelling racism is
dialogue, accompar
nietl by education

munication arttong students them»
selves. While the duty ol'educating
the Campus by creating a curriculum
that is realistically diverse for today ’s
society falls mainly on the College,
SGA has the obligation to ensure that
the issues surrounding responses to
the Gill/I ”ad" are not silenced or
distorted by tumor, ringer or misun-
dersttinding For this reason. the
SGA Cabinet is committed to taking
any necessary steps to facilitate (il‘ttr
Iogue among the student body about
the Gum “ad"
and other issues
rclatcd‘to racism
or the demands
of certain
multicultural
groups on cam-
pus.

We‘ invite all
members of the
carrtpus cominur
nity to attend the SGA sponsored diar
logue about the Grim “ad" and the
aftermath of the Thursday, October
17 discussion. This dialogue will be
held Monday, November 4 at thc
Harris Center and Will be moderated
by SGA President Rupin Thakkar.

Alternative-Break puts academics in perspective
Groups report back from dl'sasterrrelief mission in' North Carolina

By MELINDA JONES
Staff Writer

For students living under the bit hat is Grinnell College academics,

shadowed by the seemingly gletltct tutti mot-c apphcahlc cuts of exams and
pttpcrs Twenty-live Grillilcllinils tvcrc rcinindctl ol this as they embarked
on the ‘96 Full Altcrt‘tntwc Break trip

Two groups, one led by Mail Rhoades ‘99 and the other by .leiliil minor
'99 and Kevin McGoldrick ‘99. spent their full break doing (I ter relief
work In Raleigh, North Carolina, an (iron [but found itsclliln shambles lIS tt

htlnicttnt: struck, it dcvtlsttttcd Raleigh and its sutrountlillg areas to such an
extent that much clean-up work is yet to he done. in fact it was the great
degree of damage that prompted lm-irncr and McGoldrick to choose this
particular project. Larimcr said, “We thought this progrtnn would be wurllr
while because, even though there is still so much work to be done in Run
lclgh, inllny work groups have lost interest They were very ready and will-
ing to have its there ”

The groups made the trek to RaiCigiL drilled Wllll tools, two mllSSWcjarS

til eagerness to do nity sort of work not requiring a thesis statement. They
were assigned to work tlliotigll the United Methodist Church of Raleigh
Disaster Response Team, a group that will ks to alleviate the damage caused
by natural disasters. In addition to providing work for the vuluntccrs, cltureh

The groups worked for a total of four days. Tasks ranged from heavy
physical labor to making phone calls in the disaster reliefofflce. The major-
ity of the work involvcd cutting and removing trees that had been knocked
over by the force of the hurricane into people‘s lawns, and in some cases.
even onto their houses, sheds and cars. The damage was extensive. and many
ofthe hurricane victims seemed to have lost hope that help would ever are
rive, “More than the actual physical work we did, I think we helped the
people just by showrng up," said Rhoades.

Several group members worked at putting a new roof on a house whose
old roof had been damaged by the storm. The completion of this task was
rewarding not only for the owner of the house. who was not able to repair
the roofherself, but also for the students who spent days hammering shingles
to get the job done.

Office work, includlng rnakiitgcalls to people who had previously 8X7
pressed a need for help, was also done by students on the trip. This job
provided them With an entirely new perspective of the hurricane’s effects,
showing them the overwhelming amount of people who need assistance in
picking up the picccs orthcir lives. and how difﬁcult it IS to attempt to reach
out to each and every one of them

The end ofthe week brought the slightly bruiscd and achy students back
to Grinnell With an unforgettable experience under their belts.

“The one thing that affected me most about the week was that we weren‘t
Just picking up trees. We were picking up people’s lives." McGoldrick said
Rhoades agrees. “Alternative Break is a service to the people we help, butI

members also allowed the students to stay in their homes for the week

think the people it beneﬁts the most are those who go on the trip. I feel that
I got much more out of this trip than I put into it.” .

Dear Grinnell College,

It has been a pleasure to work with the
Grinnell College community over the years I have
lived in Grinnell. In the late 70’s I worked as El car-
penter in Buildings and Grounds. I soon developed
an appreciation for the contribution that Grinnell
College brings to the Grinnell area.

Our family owns and operated Carroll’s Pump-
kin Farm.‘ It has been fun entertaining many of you

at the farm during October.

As a Real Estate Broker Associate with
Ramsey-Weeks, Inc. I have worked with dozens of
students Over the years as a property manager for off
campus housing. I have found students to be some
of the best tenants I work with. I especially enjoy
getting acquainted with students from foreign coun-

tries.

As your State Representative I will always be
open to your concerns and available to assist you with
any matters involving State government as yotl at-

tend Grinnell College.

I would be honored to have your vote on November

5th.

Ml: Danto’s lecture will be en-

moral issues winch are raised by phor
tography, especially as manifested
through photographic portraits, raise
ing ethical questions about the po»
tential rights ofthe photographic sub-
ject. According to Mr. Danto, when
the camera, which captures only a
fraction of a second, is used to de
pict a truth, be it a person in a porn
traitor a candid gesture. it does not
necessarily show this tmth. We do
not see with the eye what the cam-
era sees, and therefore the camera
represents. possibly, something
which is not two.

Danto continued from pg 3

In explaining his interest in this
topic, Mr. Danto drew a parallel to
the questions involved with psycho-
logical experiments on human sub-
jects. for which ethical guidelines
have been set. Should such guide-
lines be considered by photogra-
phers?

The few photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe depicting people who
did not consent to being photo-
graphed raises this question. Rich-
ard Avedon‘s photo of Mr. Dante‘s
friend Isaiah Berlin also raised this
question, as Mr. Danto described that
the photograph was “not Isaiah."
Should Mr. Berlin‘s name be used in
the title of the portrait if it does not
truly represent trim as a person? Is it
really a photograph of him? Mr.
Danto will address these questions
directly tomorrow, from 4:30 to 6:00
p.m.in ARH 102. His speech is en-
titled “Ethics and Aesthetic Appear-
