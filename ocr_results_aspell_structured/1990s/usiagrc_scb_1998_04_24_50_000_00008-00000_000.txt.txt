The Grinnell College baseball
team struggled against some
strong competition last weekend.
dropping four straight contests to
Monmouth, defending MWC chamr
pion. The Pioneers lost their ﬁnal
two home games of the season. 3»2,
13-6, and then were defeated by the
Fighting Scots on the road. 13-4 and
14-0. This week the diamondmen
are hoping to pick up the tempo be-
fore heading to Illinois College on
Saturday and Sunday for two double-
headers.

“It was very disappointing to not
score some clutch runs when we
needed them against Monmouth,"
commented Coach ’Iim Hollibaugh.
“Our pitching performances were
right there, but we just could not
break through with solid offensive
output. Overall, the losses were very
discouraging for everyone, but I am

It‘s back to the links for the
Grinnell College men‘s golf team
this Week. The Pioneers travel to
the Buena Vista Classic on Friday
and Saturday.

“The BV meet is the most com-
petitive we‘ll have all season.
There will be very good Iowa Con—
ference schools and some other
teams with players on scholarr
ship,“ explained Coach Greg
Wallace.

“We‘ll get to play one ofthe top
courses in the state of Iowa, the
Spencer Country Club, So far this
season we have not shot a good
first round in a tworday tourna»
ment. That will be our focus this
week," he added.

Last week the Pioneers did not
compete. Coach Wallace had the
players work on improving their
short games during practice,
“Hopefully our work will pay off
for us this week." said Wallace.

conﬁdent that this squad has what it
takes to fight back and still acconi»
plish some great things."

Saturday the Pioneers took an
early one~run lead in the ﬁrst inning
when Michael Munoz scored on a 1.?
Christiansen single. However, the
Scots responded with authority in the
second, knocking in three runs to
steal the lead for good. Rob Martin
did manage an impressive solo bomb
in the fourth inning. but it was not
enough to overcome the consistency
of Monmouth.

This consistency was further dem-
onstrated in the second game Satur-
day and in both of the Sunday
matchups, In these three contests the
Fighting Scots hammered a total of
40 runs and 9 home runs.

“They arejust a good ball club,"
remarked Hollibaugh. “They won
conference last year and showed us
why they are the champions.

Granted, we did not play to the level
we expected, but it is wrong to dwell
on the negatives when there were so
many positives," '

A few of these positives included
seven strikeouts for Jacob Chavez in
the ﬁrst game and two homers and
six strikeouts for pitcher Joel
Cladouhos in the second game Sat-
urday. Perry Gordon also connected
for a round»trlpper Sunday.

Next up for the diamondmen are
the Blue Boys ofIllinois College. In
order to still have a chance to make
the conference tournament, the Pio-
neers have placed themselves in a
must»win situation.

“We just need to go back to the
bastcs and get in thc groove of win-
ning some games," concluded
Hollibaugh. “We will scrimmage all
this week to prepare, and hopefully
everyone will stay positive and fo»
Cused on what we need to achieve."
