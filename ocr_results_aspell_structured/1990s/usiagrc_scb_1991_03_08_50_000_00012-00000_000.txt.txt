in fourth (243). The remaining
teams were Beloit (116), Knox

Ressner is one of the most prolific
performers in this conference. He
haswonﬂtreeindividualeventseztch
year at Conference, and he's still
got a year left. Luther Davis also
had an outstanding meet, as well as
Joe Zimsen. But I really feel the
whole learn deserves the recogni-
tion.” Oben'niller commented.
The times at the meet were out4
standing to say the least. Ressner

set conference, pool, and school
records in the 400 I.M.(4:15.34),
the 100 ﬂy (:51.7), and the 200
ﬂy(l:55.03). Ressner was also on
[our winning relays. Davis set a
school record in the 50 (21.40),
and set the conference, pool, and
school records in the 100 free with
his leadoff split in a relay (46.59).
Davis won the 200 free and was a
member of four winning relays as

well.

11’. Fiening set a pool record in
the 1650 free (16:59.27), and also
won the 500 free. Joe Zimsen won
theZOO I.M. in a school record time
of1:59.35, whileplztcing second in
the 50 free and 200 back events.
Other excellent individuals came
from Scott Truelove in the 200
breastand 200 and 4001.M., Doug
Murphy and Charlie Munin in the

freestyle sprints, and Mike Nield in
the breaststroke events. Grinnell
won all 5 relay events as well.

Obenniller commented, “I was
very pleased with the attitude and
spiritandefforts ofthistcam. Itwas
aphenomenal performance. Having
lhe home crowd was very good for
us. We really appreeiated the sup-
port."

In the process of mopping up
their competition. the Mad Dogs
qualified 5 swtmmers for Nations
als, who will compete in tip to 11
events in the meet. Ressner quali-
fied in the 100 ﬂy. the 200 ﬂy, and
the 400 I.M. Davis qualified in the
50 and 100 free events, while also
teaming up with Doug Murphy,
Charlie Murrin. and Joe Zimsen to
qualify tn the 200 free relay.

NCAA rules allow a swimmer
to swim any events at Nationals
once they qualify injust one event.
Because of this rule, Davis may
swim in the 200 free, while
Obermiller plans to put together 5
relayswiththe55wimmers.“1think
that Ressner and Davis will be
competitive, as well as the relays.
We plan on going in there giving it
our best shotl ” said Obermiller. The
NCAA Division 111 Swim Champi~
onships will take place March 21-
23 at Emory University in Atlanta,
Georgia.
