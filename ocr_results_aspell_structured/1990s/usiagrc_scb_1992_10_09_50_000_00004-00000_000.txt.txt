Hoefgen urges both
women and men to
communicate

by Anne Hoefgen

l-lereatGrtnnellCollegewe
sometimes feel sheltered from
the harshness of the “real
world," even in Ihe wake of
Tammy's death and the latest
reported sexual assault on
campus. Our campus is safer
than many places, but sexual
vrolencehappens everywhere.

As part of my tntemship at
Planned Parenthood of Greater
Iowa, I am involved wilh an
upcomingconferenceentitled
“Acquaintancc Rape: Educatr
ing for Prevention.” It has
caused me to wonder, where
can we start in the prevention
of acquaintance rape?

Wemustconfrontsexistlari-
guage, attitudes. stereotypes,
and behavior which degrade
and objectify women. his the
job of both men and women to
unlearn beliefs and behaviors
which allowrapeto occur. An
understanding of our social-
ization does not forgive, eXr
onerate, or rationalize tape,
but his a step in the processof
reorganizingandreshapingthe

societalbackdropinwhich wealllive
in order to create a safer environment
for everyone.

Some of my rmearch I found
slarllingand horrifying. Anthropolo-
gist Peggy Reeves Sunday labels cul-
tures which tolerate violence and our
courage men to be tough, aggressive,
and competitive while devaluing
femininechamclerlsticsasrapeprone.
The FBI estimates that .7% ofthe US
female population is raped annually,
ln 1990 that amounted to 683,000
women.

Robin Warshaw's 1988 book
[NeverCalledltkapeconlainsalarm—
ing statistics on acquaintance/date
rape. Shefoundoneoutofevery four
college women reported being victim
of rape or attempted rape and 84%
knew their attackers. A 1986 UCLA
study found 50% of themensurveyed
said they would force a women to
have sex if they were sure they would
not be caught.

Why is that, as Warshaw found,
one in twelve college aged men ad-
mitted to behavior that fits the legal
deﬁnition of rape but would not ads
mil to rape‘.7 1 still do not have an
answer.

The socialization of boys and
girls often results in conﬂicting mes-
sages and unequal power relation

ships. ”Locker talk” and the double
standard are alive and well. The idea
persrsts that women only say “no" in
order to protect their reputations but
do not mean it, therefore men must
use sexual pressure to “score.”

Another aspect of date/acquainr
lance rape is the role of alcohol and
other drugs. Iowa law states that
sexual abuse has occurred when the
victim is in a state of ”incapacity
which precludes giving consent."
(Chapter 709.4a) Being drunk is not
an excuse for inappropriate behavior,
but it does blurjudgcmenl and alter
already ambiguous situations.

In a March 1991 Ms. survey.
37% 0[4,450 women said they had
consented to sex with a man because
they were afraid to resist. The same
survey found only 7% had never ex
perience male violence and said they
never knew a rape victim.

Everyone must understand that

no" means “no." Women must also
learn to say “yes" and communicate
their intentions. Men must listen to
the women in their lives and try to
understand the fears of women. While
communication between men and
women is essential, the burden must
notlay with women. Simplyput. rape
will stop when men slop raping.
