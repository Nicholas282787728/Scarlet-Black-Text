Comic Horror Chills Evil Dead II

By Steve Feller and
Mardi Strejeek

Imagine hordes of zombies
crawling out of their graves in
search of human flesh. Imagine
people being rendered limbless.
gallons of blood pouring out of
their mutilated bodies. Imagine a
terror so great that you will not
be able to sleep for days. Well,
this is what you WON’T see in
Evil Dead”.

Although the title, Evil Dead
II, sounds threatening. the movie
consists of a good deal of comedy
mixed in with more shocking
scenes. You wouldn’t think it
could be funny to see someone
sever their own hand or to see a
close up of an eyeball flying
through the air, but it is, trust
us Many of the gory pans in
this movie are done to such

E‘t'sco and Fiddler
Featured in
Cultural Week

By Louise Alcom

Chalutzim, the Jewish
students organization will pruent
two ﬁlms during Jewish Cultural
Week: The F rirco Kid and Fiddler
on the Roof.

The Frisco Kid is a comedy
staring Gene Wilder as a Polish
rabbi traveling across the Old
West to get to a congregation in
San Francisco Along the way,
he encounters many mishaps and
is saved by a grim gunfighter
played by Harrison Ford.

Based on stories by Sholem
Aleichem. Fiddler on the Roof is
a musical derived from the story
of Tevye the dairyman (Topol,
who also played the role in the
London stage play) and his
worries over the marriages of his
three oldest daughters Tzeitel,
Hodel, and Chava. The
cinematography is not fantastic.
but the wonderful songs {mm the
Broadway musical are
entcnaining and the scenes where
Tevyc talks to God as if speaking
to his best friend are something
moving.

 

extreme that it is impossible to
take them seriously.

However. Evil Dead ll isn’t
all fun and games. There are
some genuinely scary and
gruesome scenes, but they are all
done in perfectly bad taste. These
parts are made possible by some
very clever special effects (and
some cheesy ones, too).

Although the title suggests
that this is a sequel, knowledge
of the ﬁrst Evil Dead movie is
not needed to enjoy this movie.
The basic premise of the movie
is that a couple arrives at a very
secluded cabin, planning on
spending some intimate time
alone. All too soon, the main
character ﬁnds a tape recorder
which has been left there by the
owner of the cabin. The tape in
the machine contains recorded the
words which are written in the

book of the dead, The hero plays
this tape, and unwittingly
unleashes an evil force upon the
forest surrounding the cabin His
girlfriend quickly becomes
possessed and the hero is
impelled to decapitate her. The
diabolical power then attempts to
gain control of the main
character. However. the hero
ﬁghts back and spends the rest of
the movie resisting the evil force.

The plot may seem rather
weak, but that doesn't rally
matteri The movie doesn’t try to
take itself seriously and you will
probably appreciate it more if
you don‘t. either. If you are
looking for intellectual
stimulation, pass up this movie,
but if you want a light, enjoyable
evening full of thrills, chills and
spills, with lots 0' laughs on
hand, sex: Evil Dead”.

Oscar Winner Babette's Feast
Serves Taste of Sensuality

Food. food, food. Babette’s
Feast cams its tasty sensuality
from the joy of eating This
French tale won the 1987
Academy Award for Best Foreign
Film, and is heralded for its
“heanfelt testament to the joys of
artistic expression and a tolerant
metaphysics that gently
reconciles the holy and the
sensual. the spirit and the ﬂesh.

The story is set in the late
18005 of Puritan Denmark where
a French refugee toils as cook.
After founeen years of repression,
she is able to Showoff her talean
at a banquet of gastronomic

The movie is considered a
classic and should not be missed,

Redford and
Fonda Shack
Up in Neil
Simon‘Film
By Brett Fechheimer

in 1967, a pre—Burch Carridy
Robert Redford and a pre-Hanoi
Jane Fonda starred together in the
light and endearing Neil Simon
comedy Barefoot in the Park. In
the movie, Redford and Fonda
play newlyweds who live in an
apartment on the top floor of a
five-story walk-up in New York.
The apartment, much to the
dismay of the straight-laced
Redford character, is poorly
ventilated and achingly small.
To top it all off, a European,
slightly-hippcrvthatt Ralph Furley
Casanova lives in the building’s
attic and must use the couple‘s
skylight every time he wants to
go to his apartment.

A typical scene from this
film would have Fonda
complaining that she wants to do
something FUN for a change, and
her husband replying that he has
to look over some papers or get
some rest. Thcn Fonda gets
upset and locks the bedroom
door, leaving Redford alone with
his mother-in-law or with a
telephone installer.

All in all, though, this movie
is a harmless, typically
Simonesque effort. However,
Redford al'rccionados be wanted:
there are absolutely no beef-cake
shots in this movie.

Airplane! Takes Off in Forum

of the-airport movies (although it
seems like one). It was created as
a parody of a 1957 movie called
Zero Hour, 3 movie where the
ﬂight crew gets food poisoning
and an cx'Air Force pilot (who is
afraid to fly) is required to land
the plane. But you don’t have to
see Zero ﬂour or the other
Airport movies to enjoy
Airplahel. The parody stands
alone as an interesting picture.

SCHOLARS'

And it's funny. The viewer
is constantly barragcd with jokes
and sight gags. See Hare
Krishnas get crushed by a
grumpy pilot, watch an elderly
white woman translate urban
“jive," and witness a ﬂight
attendant perform fellatio on‘a
blow-up doll. There‘s all this.
and more.

If you‘re looking for laughs,
Airplane! is the movie for you.
