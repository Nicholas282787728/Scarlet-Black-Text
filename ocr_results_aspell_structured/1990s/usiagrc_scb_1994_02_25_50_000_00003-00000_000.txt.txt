Focus on Grinnell
student periodicals

By Eric Olsen

ERIODICAL publications are
vital pans of any community.
Theyinfonn,furthcrcommu-

nication, andallow peopleto express

largepart in fostering thecommunily
uf Grinnell. If it weren't for periodi-
als, you wouldn't be reading this
i icle right now.
Most of the periodical publica-
tions on campus are student run and
unded by the Student Publications
nd Radio Committee. Among the
regular periodicals is the paper you
now hold in your hand, the Scarlet
m1 Black. Other student run perir
dicals include the Freehand Press,
he GUM, and the Creature.

"I want it to be the people's pa-
r," states Zlabinger emphatically.
"The newspaper is a reflection of our
ociety here at Grinnell." Zlabinger

the immediate history of Grinnell.
Zlabinger hopes to set a tradition
of excellence by hiring many ﬁrst-
year students to provide experience
after he and other editors graduate.
On balancing academics with work,
Zlabinger states that. "We are stu
dents first, journalists second." He
believes that working on the paper is
an experience that is very similar to
the real world, with real deadlines
and real responsibilities.
WhatZlabinger would like more
of from the campus is input. He
encourages letters to the editor and
feedback on the paper‘s quality, If
you are interested in working for the
5&3 or would like to voice your
opinion on the paper, please contact
Zlahinger or VAX [SANDB].
Another regular forum for stu-
dents student expression is the Grin-
nell Underground Magazine, better
known as the GUM. The GUM was
started two years ago, and has grown
to becomean extremely popularcarn-
pus publication. Managing editor
junior Tommy Erdci believes that the

On a slightly more refined litera

literary magazine that features po»

The newest periodical to hit Grin-
nell is the Creature. The Creature was
founded last semester by junior Man

Creature includes KDIC show profiles

committee, inlerviews with musicians,
and regional music news. "We want to

but Miller says it should be published
four or ﬁve times this semester.

All of these periodical publica
tions rely on the campus community
for the articles they print. They serve
as a valuable means of communica-
tion and expression for Grinnell.

Letters from the Old World

Part V—Academia
By Riva Sharples, Foreign Correspondent

 

 

that I could easily spend my entire study-abroad career just traveling around England and doing no

homework. As tempting as it has been to just travel and not do any work (especially since the British
system allows it). I have been spending time in the library here at Lancaster University (Professor Kissane and
Professor Connelly, please be proud!), getting to know and understand the British educational system.

The British system of education is much different than the American college system. I'm not going to say
that it's superioror inferior, but it does seem to produce very knowledgeable gladuatesr From what] understand,
British studenm specialize in one of three areas during the last two years of high school and then by the time
they graduate from high school, they are supposedly at the level of the average American college sophomore
in their major. The undergraduate degree for British students is a threeAyear process. There is no concept of
a liberal—ans education here and so British students take only classes in their major for the entire three years.
Of course, in keeping with the British system, I am taking three English courses while here -» Romantic
literature, Victorian literature, Shakespeare and one an course (okay, so I'm cheating a little and not staying
entirely within my ﬁeld). I feel overwhelmed by English literature and] really miss my Grinnell liberal arts
education (for those of you whoknow me well. I know I never get very diversified at Grinnell either, but at least
I’m not this bad!)

"Minimalist" is a good word to describe classes and academia in general here. Unless you are inwardly
motivated to study, you could easily breeze through the system without doing much work at all, especially if
you are just an American here for one semester! I have only one essay and one test due in each class for the
entire semester. I have no assigned readings, only suggested readings. My syllabus is full of "suggested texts,"
and lists of analytic and critical theory books that might help me understand the subject better. Students are
encouraged and expected to do much reading and research on dieir own and to pick out a particular area that
interests them and then research it on their own. Ofcourse, as an American used in being spoon-fed assignments,
tests and papers, I ﬁnd it very hard to make myself do anything not "required." I have only six hours of class
per week ,, each of my English classes meets for one hour as a large, lecture group and then as a smaller.
discussion group of lO-lZpeople. The lectures are abstract and designed to be supplementary to one's readingr
l was told, upon arrival here, that lectures should consist of about only five percent of the knowledge and
information I should gain while studying here A list of lecture topics is handed out in advance, and students
can choose to attend those lectures pertaining to their particular area of concentration in a subject. Today's
Shakespeare lecture was enLiLled, "Blood and Guts in Shakespeare."

Professors are very casually dressed and wear jeans, t-shins, and sneakers to class. The strangest difference
between classes here and at Grinnell is that some professors here smoke cigarettes while lecturing and in
seminars! I haven't quite yet adjusted to the British system of studying and their hours. The library closes at
10:00 pm. every night during the week (that's about the time I head over to Hurling in Grinnelll) and is only
open for four hours, from 3:00 pm. until 7:00 pm, on Sundays. The library system here is downright annoying
at times and I really miss good old Hurling. They don't have any cozy little study areas here, or, for thatmatler,
any private study areas at all, except for a few hard, wooden tables with names carved all over them that look
like somethingoutofhigh school. You can onlycheckoutten books ata time here and mostare due back within
a week of the chuk-out date. If you forget to return them in time, you are fined ten pence per day per item.
Speaking of charges. the British like to charge foreverything. lteven costs money to print out a paper! licosts
seven pence for every page printed out on the laser printer in the computer lab. You have to buy a card andinsert
it in the machine before you inslruct the computer to print

At the sports center (Lancaster's equivalent to the PEC), you have lo pay one pound, 20 pence for every
30 minutes you work out on in the "life fitness room." Again, a card must be purchased and inserted in the
slairmaster, rowing»machine or treadmill before you can use it. I just can't believe that I have to pay to work
our, and that's after I already paid a membership fee! There are many interesting activities that take place on
campus during week (on the weekends. it is dead) Last week was "Gay, Lesbian. and Bi-Sexual Awareness
week," which had many activities similiar to those held at Grinnell. There is a different movie showing every
night Monday through Friday (usually an American movie), and if you‘ve paid your money to become a
member, you can go and pay just one pound to see that evening's movie. This week. they are showing "The
Wedding Banquet", "The Firm", and "Jurassic Park”. among others. And if campus doesn't hold enough
activities to keep one satisﬁed. lhere is always the city of Lancaster or smaller towns surrounding it! Nightlife
and pub activity will be the subject of my next letter until then, study hard and appreciate your comfortable
library (some of us have to sit on hard wooden chairs). Cheers.
