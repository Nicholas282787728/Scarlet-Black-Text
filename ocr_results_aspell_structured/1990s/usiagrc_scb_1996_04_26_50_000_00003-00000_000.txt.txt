Dear Todd,

”The computer ate my
Fill in the blank. Choose nearly any
noun; any tlny now 1 tully expect to
heursomeonesay “l‘m sorry I’m late,
The computer ate my underwear."
The problem With blaming things on
acomplicated relationship with tech
nology is that it’s so often true. It
feels like an overused excuse.

Computers and I established the
bastc pattern or our reloitonship in
the mid—eighties I feed them data;
they teed me error messages while
dining on the data. Every once in a
ivhile we. manage to get the relatiom
ship to a point where we understand
and fulfill each others' needs, which
is the signal for change to sweep
through and take us back to the first
phase. I can‘t really complain too
much about that. A lot of my relax
tionships have worked inexactly that
mannetimy relationship with my
own mind during math courses, for
example, not to mention afew friend—
ships.

One's iriends may or may not be
the best source of advice in this type
ofrelationship, Everything mayclick;
the printer may spit out an elegant
copy of one's report in the intended
language: my mind may suddenly be
able to perform a complex mathe—
matical operation; peace may be re—
stored Then again, the common
\ ice ofptitle may step in, whispering
(L) one's friend 'Don’t look like you
don't know what (s)he‘s talking
ehmit—sry something plauSlble "
This can result in advice oirhc type
which makes some consultants tichi
when they come in and untangle a
nellrintentioned mess.

Myself, I preter to rememher that
I have alternatives. Cur and paste
may be less exact when it involves
actual glue, Using a calculator may
not give one an idea of the beauty of
the calculation, andsimply spending
some needed time with a friend who's
smhle may lack the edge or dealing
ivirh a triend whos brilliantly unpre.
dictable. But it’s nice to realize that
one does have alternatives and that
these alternatives, having benefits o(
theiroivn, are not necessarily second
rate. That means that 1 try to have a
hartl copy in case my data is eaten,

at course, that doesn't always
work. I’ve got to go now, i must call

The Dance Troupe presents the
second performance of its annual
spring concert tonight at 8 PM in
Roberts Theatre.

The show opened last night and
explores many terms of dunes, in.
clucllng elements of hnllet, hip—hop,
modern interpretive and traditional
American folk styles. The themes
and moods of the clnnces vary (roin
playtul, humorous to melancholy
expressions.

The troupe often students has
been dancmg and preparing for the
show since early lost {all Teresa

niques and technical aspects of the
periormanee. She choreographed
only one oi the sliow’s dances indl/
ilidually and left most of the show’s
direction to the student dancers

Many of the itleas for the inclh
vidual dances came from a personal
event or emotion in the students‘
lives one oi the show's pieces is
based on letters which the students
wrote. They tried to interpret their
words through the motions in the
dance.

Additional students involved in
the College theatre department are
working on the show and have con—
tributed amazing visual effects with
the lights in Roberts Theatre There
are many (1 . mg and colorful dis.
plays during a hiphop segment, and
thedancets’ leaping movements flash
heiore a Vibrant background,

The dancers also wear costumes
that bring out much of the character
olthe indiVidual dance. Students in
the costume shop constructed sever
al ofthe outfits for the dancers which
need to be functional and allow free
movement.

lemi McDowell ‘98 enyoys her
first year in the troupe because rt
challenges her to teens and control
her body through dance. The troupe
has a diverse group of individuals
with varying levels of experience,
but they have formed strong relae
tronships Through their mutual love
for dance

McDowell suggests to the audir
ence, “lust einoy it. We're having a
teally good time." Because the show
represents such various themes and
dance forms, she hopes the audience
remains open to the many expres<
sions and seeks only what meaning
they can see
