loaded the bases in the fifth by

hitting the sixth batter of the game.
Coach Greg Wallace then brought
Keith Kromash to the mound. Two

defending conference champs.
Grinnell lost. both games, but there
were a iew highlights. Mark
Lehman pitched the ﬁrst game. In a
losing effort, he nevertheless
pitched the best gamc he‘s pitched
all season. Lehman attributes the
exceptional movement on his
fastballand his bitingcurveball“to
sleeping with the ball, among other
things, the night before the game."
Also,B.J,Jahn hitatowennghome
run in the second gameofthedouble
header.

This weekend. Grinnell will fade

hitting continues, Grinnell will be
able to improve on its 33 confer-
ence record.
