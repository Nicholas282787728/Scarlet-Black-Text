beck, both 15, are charged with threat

Fonscca, I4, is charged with threat of
arson or “aiding and abetting in such
activity,” also a Class D felony.

ing to Sgt. Randy Hanssen, investiga-
tions commander for the Gnnnell Po»
lice Department,thechargeshavcbecn
referred to Poweshiek County Juve-
nile Court.

Written threat April 26

The charges stem from a written
bomb threat that occurred at the high
school at. approximately 10:30 am.
April 26. Authorities evacuated stu-
dents and staff from the school and
launchedathomughsearchofthebuild-
rng. No incendiary of explosive was
found. l

The bomb threat at Grinncll High
School followcdonctheprevious week
at Grinncll Middle School. Both are
regardedbylaw—enforcementofﬁcials
as “copycat” threats made in the wake

ofthe shooting and bombing incident‘

ﬂtColumbineHigh Sehoelin Littleton,
' Colo, an event that dominated the
media.

Many schools around the country
have experienced similar threats fol-
lowing the Colorado tragedy.

Grinncll Police Chief Michael Bit»
mingham told The Herald-Register

Wednesdaythat the local middleschool
incident remains under investigation.

Information from students, staff

Students and staffat the high school
contributed information that led to the
arrests of Stevens, Storbeck and
Fonseca, Birmingham said.

Grinnell High School Principal
David Stoakcs said Wednesday that
the three students are at home and are
not attending classes.

Asked whether the Grinncll-New-
burg Board of Education will conduct
expulsionhearingstegardingthe three,
as it did fortwo students expelled after
a special board meeting last Saturday,
Stoakes said a board meeting on the
subject has yet to be scheduled.

”Ourprocedures are the same for all
students, although we have different
procedures for students who are in
special education," Stoakes said.

A cooperative effort

The investigation into the bomb
threat, the GI-IS principal said, “was a
cooperative effort between the admin»
istration at the high school, faculty,
students and the Grinncll Police De-
partment."

Emphasizing that the three accused
students are ”innocent until proven
guilty," Stoakes said he is “confident
at this point that the evidence is strong
enough to take to the next level" of
juvenile-court proceedings.

Stoakcs said it is important that the
schools let students know that bomb
threats are not taken “as ajoke."

“Hopefully, that will begin to have
an impact on all of our students," he
said. “Certainly this has had a major

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Harking back a few years is a Her-
ald-chistertraditionofconveresations
with animals.

Itbeganmanyycatsago(somelongr
time readers of the newspaper may
remember) when A,L. (Lowry) Frisbie,
editor of the Herald-Register, carried
on rcgularconversations With a certain
robin which inhabited a portion of his
yard.

This robin was a very emdite crea~
ture with a sophisticated knowledge of
world affairs. so it and Mr. Frisbie
camed on conversations of consider-
able depth, providing Frisbie, a gradu-
ate of Grinncll College with the class
of“ought ought," (1900 or ‘00) as he
usedto say,") with a venue fordiscuss-
ing subjects far and wide

(Anothercropof“oughtoughts"will
be hatched next yearas the high school
and college classes of 2000 (‘00) hits
the commencement trail).

Around was reminded oer. Frisbie
and his robin by the recent sight ofa
pairorrabbits gambollng on the green
in its yard, and the opportunity to con-
vcrse with creatures fromanotherrealm
to obtain their opinions on current
events.

The conversation might well have
gone like this:

“Hey, Mr. Rabbit, what do you
think?"

“What do I think about what?”

“Ifyou'rc nottoobusy dartinghither
and thither and munching on clover,
what do you think about the fact that
the United States is bringing refugees
from Kesove hereto helpthcmsurvivc
forced removal from their homes?"

“I think it‘s great in one sense, butit
must be awfully hard on them In an-
other $6186.”

“Hard on them? How?"

“How would you like to be picked
up and swooped thousands of miles
away from your homeland?"

“It would be tough but isn’t it better
than living in a crowded refugeecamp
with limited housing, food and pn-
vacy?"

“I suppose, butat least you’re closer
to your homeland to which you hope
you’ll be able to return at some time."

“That‘s true, but the United States
says itwill be ableto help the refugees
return to their homes once hostilities

“That‘s very noble, but whcnisthat?
Sounds to me like it could be a long
time, longcrthan anyonethought when

e got into this."

. “Many people including Gov.
Vilsack of Iowa have offered to ﬁnd

homes for these people and help them
get settled, Iowa‘s done that before,
you know, especially Southeast Asian
war refugees. Maybe some of these
folks will decide to stay as they did."

“They'd beverywelcome. It’s ahuge
adjustment, though, one that I'm not at
all sure I would be able to make, but
more power to them if they can do it.
Personally, 1 like green grass and a
playmate to run around with."

“Maybe the Kosovans would ﬁndan

also."

The Second Mile has found a new
role for itself, according to Katheryn
Hoisington, secretary of the board of
directors.

On an aﬁemoon last month a couple
from Germany visited The Second
Milc's clothingclosetinthelowerlevel
of the Memorial Building, says
Hoisingtcn.

The gentleman of the couple related
how he and his wife make a trip to the
United States twice a year to collect
good used clothing for resale there.

They found a lot here. adds
Hoisington, and explained that they
spend about three weeks in the heart-
land each time, mostly in lowa, Mis-
souri and the Kansas City area. Then
the clothing is sent to Chicago where it
is packed into a container for transpor-
tatton to Germany by plane.

They make a living doing this, the
German couple told The Second Mile
volunteers, even with all the expenses,
because the cennan people are huge
fans ofgoods from the United States.

These projects are the winners
in this year's lowa Peace lnstitutc's
10th annual Grinncll Peace Project
Awards Program, an extension of
an essay contest established in

1984. They are testimony to the students' creativity and their commitment to
improving their communities — and to the Grinncll-based Peace Institute's
continuing efforts to resolve conﬂict and promote peace.

Grinncll was extremely lucky to ltavc been chosen as the headquarters
community for the Peace Institutc, Since its inception, its focus ltas undcl'n
gone certain shiﬂs, with less ofan emphasis on international issues and more
on conﬂict resolution in schools. But its mission remains an essential one.

Clearly, young people In Iowa and in many other pans ofthc US. Itavc felt
the positive effects oflPl's effort. This year's Peace Project was expanded to
include entries submitted by college students, a logical extensron ofthc
program. The quality ofthc projects submitted forjudging by a committee of
IPI staffand local residents is apparent in the efforts uttdenaken by the
winning schools at both the K-l2 and college levels.

The Peace Institute has demonstrated once again why it is such an impor-
tant entity 7 and why it deserves the continued suppon oflocal residents.

Write the governor
and urge a veto

Art aide to Gov. Tom Vilsack told us Friday that it will probably be
another week or so before the governor makes a decision on whether to itclnr
veto language contained in an infrastructure appropriations measure. As we
reported last week, the language, which would forbid use of condemned land
for trails, would have an adverse effect on the Grinncll Atca Recreation Trail

(GA RT).

That leaves local residents with a Window of opportunity to write the
govcmor and urge that he exercise his line—item veto authority. People might
also want to suggest that Vilsack vcto a separate measure banning the
condemnation of agricultural land for the development oftrails

The aide, Aida Ainoura, said vilsack's legal startis currently examining
the language in tlic appropriations bill. The governor ltlrnsclf has said he has
reservations about the condemnation legislation.

Projects aimed at improving recreational opportunities in Iowa dcsewc
widcspread support. They're good for everyone. Not only do they provide
new ways to enjoy the Iowa countryside and pursue healthy activities. they
also reduce bicyclc and foot trafﬁc on routes dominated by motor vehicles,

thus enhancing safcty.

We haven’t met anyone who's opposed to GART, because it would
provide a direct hnk between Grinncll and Rock Crcck Lzlkc, So it's impor-
tant that backers ofthc project let the govcntor know how important thc

project is.
