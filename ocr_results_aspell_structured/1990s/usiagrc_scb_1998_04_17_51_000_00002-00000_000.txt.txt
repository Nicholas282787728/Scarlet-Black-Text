7 Jensens back from vision clinic

Dr. Clark Jensen (center) with colleague and patient at Kenya vision

clinic.

Dr. Clark and Anilie Jcnscn have
returned from Nairobi, Kenya, East
Arnca, where they spent ll days as
pan ofa ls-membcr eyerchrc team in

‘ the Volunteer Optomcti-ic Service to
Humanity(VOSH)programwhlchDr.
Jensen was responsible for planning
and organizing.

The team conSlsted of five op»
tometrists, an ophthalmologist, a der-
matologist and eight suppon person-
nel. In addition to Iowa, volunteers
were from the states ofMissoun, Ohio
and Washington.

The volunteers were hosted in
Nairobi by the Nairohireponi Lions
Club whose president, Manesh Patel,
met the group at the airport and expe-
dited the passage of boxes of eye
glasses, equipment and surgical sup-
plies through customs.

The Lions also made all local arr
rangementsincludingchoosingaclinic
location, providing publicity and sup-
plyinginterpreters,accordingtoJenscn,
They also were present at each clinic
session to assist and arrange additional
care for those patients with special
conditions who couldn't be treated at
the clinic.

Examinations were conducted at the,
Makuru anary School in one of
Nairobi’s poorest districts. the Jensens
report, The first cllnic day was devoted
exclusively to school children. Chil-
dren from ﬁve different primary schools
arrived for examinations, overwhelmr
ing the volunteer team by their num-
bers, but by the end of the day, approxir
mately 700 students were screened or
examined for eye problems.

The second day of the clinic was
much more organized and the number
ofpatientsmoremanagcable.Tlietcam
examined 289 patients and distributed
an almost equal number ofeyeglasses.

On the ﬁnal work day, 286 patients
were seen and a skin clinic also was

held during which Dr. Carey Bligard
and a Nairobi dermatologist saw over
150 patients with various skin condi-
tions.

Dr. Eric Bligard, the team’s oph-
thalmologist, performed 18 cataract
surgeries in the newly constructed Li-
ons’ Eye Hospital in Nairobi. In addir
tion to his surglcal eases, Dr. Bligard
presented lectures to local eye sur-
geons and instructed them in the latest
surgical techniques.

All unused eyeglasses were leﬁ for
distribution by the local Lions Club or
for use on future eye-care missions to
Kenya. Any additional surgical or
medlcal supplies also were donated to
the Lions Eye Hospital.

BefoteretumingtotheUnited States,
the Jensens and the eyercare volun-
teersvlsitedfourofKenya’smostpopu-
lar national parks: Amboseli National
Park, Masai Mara National Park, Lake
Nakuru Natlonal Park and Abadarcs
National Park where they enjoyed the
variety ofwildllfe and the diversity of
geography Kenya has to offer, the
Jensens added.

Because ofthc tremendous need,the
Jensens hope to lead another eyeecare
team to Kenya in the future, they say.
Both the Jensens look forward to re
turning to Africa.

The experience they gained and the
excellent organization ofthe local L1-
ons Club should allow future Volun-
teer Optometric Services to Humanity
volunteers to see more patients. The
Lions’ Eye Hospital in Nairobi is lo-
cated in an area of great need, and the
Jensens anticipate utilizing the
hospital‘s facilities for subsequent eye
clinics.

This would allow the Volunteer
Optometric Services to Humanity team
to provide better services, examine
additional people and provide more
surgical patients for the hospital.

that this is the IZOth cvcnt ofthis ilk,
which means that the tire boys (and

It‘s deﬁnitely an antique so that may

not be able to identify it, but there

surely are others oer. Price’s genera-

too busy getting ready for spring?

By now the Mo probably is in the
