RINNELL businesses are
struggling. Last year's
flooding, a dismal

economy, and new giant discount
warehouses in Des Moincs are all
factors that are driving Grinncllittns
out of business, according to
cntet‘prenucrslike leffPhelps, owner
of The Wine Cellar in downtown
Grinnell.

Phelps, who has owned and op»
erated The Wine Cellar since 1986,
said that business has been bad since
the ﬂooding of 1993. He doesn’t
know how much longer he’ll be in
business.

”Business has been terrible Since
July of last year,“ he said. “I used to
think that it was because of the flood.
but now I’m not so sure."

Phelps said that he sees
Grinnell’s downtown slowly dying.
There just aren’t the kind of stores
downtown there used to be, he said.

lean Hammen of Hammcnlcw~
elry agrees. Her store is going outof
businessinianuaryalmostnineyears
to the day of opening.

“When we first came to town.
there were three or four shoe stores in
town, several ladies clothing stores
andacoupleofmensclothing stores,"
she said. “But they just aren‘t here
anymore.”

“When I walk around town] see
that there isn’t a good mix of stores

anymore," said Phelps. “We don’t
get the walk-in traffic we used to."

Part ofihe reason for the decline
in Grinnell’s downtown. said
Hummen and Phelps, is that
Grinnellians don‘t think anything of
LI'AVBlIn g to Des Moines to shop. they
said.

“People aren’t bothered about
getting on ihe interstate and driving
to Des Moincs to shop now,“ said
Hammen.

Sam’s Club, a discount ware-
house, justopenedanewstorein Des
Moines and it’s hurting business at
The Wine Cellar, Phelps said. The
club sells alcohol at or below cost.
and he can't compete with that, he
said. Grinnellians new drive to Des
Moincs to buy cheaper and larger
quantities of liquor from Sam‘s, he
said.

The local l-leree has also hurt
Phelps over the years, he said.

“We were the only liquor store
in town for two years.” he said. “Then
Hy»Vce came to town. Seventy-five
to 85 percent of alcohol sales nation-
Wide are now done at Hy~Vees."

Grinnellians seem in be bypass-
ing downtown businesses to save a
few pennies hereor there. said Phelps
and Hammen.

“A lotofpeople complain about
my 18 percent markup," said Phelps.
“It‘s true that if it cosis $1, I charge
$1.18. But then Sam’s Club sclls
below cost. Instead of charging

$11.80» they charge $9.97. I just
can’t compete with that”

A dollar saved here or there is
enough to draw people to shopping
away from Grinnell, Phelps said.

Other factors that lure people
away are bigger selections and the
convenience offinding everything in
one place. But people miss out on

personal service and ihe advantages
of small town shopping when they
shop elsewhere. said Hammen.

“Of course Grinnell merchants
can‘t carry as big a selection as those
big stores," she said. “But they will
sure work to special order something
for you and they are very loyal and
helpful 3’

Stores in Grinnell are not over-
crowded. People are friendly. Own-
eis care about their customers. Own-
ers know their customers, Hainmen
said.

Sarcastic vandals deface new sculpture

MMEDIATELY after its instal
I lation. the new sculpture outside

Steiner has been vandalized, ac
cording to Grinnell Art Professor
Merle Zirkle.

“Someone wrote the word
‘Rustolium’ at the base of the sculp-
ture." said Zirkle. Rustolium is the
brand name of a commercial rust
remover for use on painted surfaces.
“Obviously, someone thought they
were being cute," said Zirkle.

The damage measured about 18
inches across, and required about an
hour of repair work before it was
entirely removed. “I was really not
sure lcould get thatwriting of ,"said
Zirkle, who lead the repair efforts.
She used acetone to remove the ac-
tual writing, but said the possibility

of leftover residue posed the biggest
challenge. “I ccnainly hope someone
won’t be doing lhm again," she said.
Zirkle notiﬁed Dean of Student
Affairs Tom Crady when she discovV
ercd the damage. “We filed a police

report about it," said Crady. “We
don‘t know who did it——whether it
was someone on campus or from the
town.”

Zirkle said she had anticipated
some climbing on the 20-foot-tall

but was disappointed at the insensi-
tivity of the Rustolium vandals.

“The writing itself could have
been more embarassing,” she ac-
knowledged, “but I had hoped that
the students here would be more sen-
sitive. ljustdidn‘texpectihis sonof
thing at Grinnell."

Zirkle said thatthe bottom of the
sculptureisactuallysupposed to rust.
It is made of untreaied cor-ten steel,
which will eventually oxidate into a
very dark, cinnamon»brown color.
The sculpture outside of the Science
Building,eonstructedbyZirkle'slate
husband. is also made of untreated
corrten.

The very top of the sculpture is
made of aluminum, which will not

rust.
