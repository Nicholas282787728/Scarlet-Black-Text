Giving a party tor an entire French

Grinnell teammate was a member, are
some of the experiences or Paul Som-
ers, '13, a member of the varsity for
several years, and now in France as
an artilleryman,

"On Christmas Eve we gave a party
to the French people of our village,
young and old, rich and poor. We
decorated the y. M. C. A., which is the
tormer haymow oi an enormous barn,
with evergreens and a Christmas tree
about twenty feet tall. Captain
Wighunen was in Paris at the time oi
President Wilson‘s arrival, and he
brought back an elaborate supply oi
decorations and mo worth oi toys
and favors for everyone present, due
noted by win. Claudell, a wealthy
Frenchman. or course- we had a
Santa Claus who passed out the pres-
ents. Batterymen distributed a pack-
age of cookies and cigarettes to all the
people. The Y. M. C. A. gave each
soldier a package of cookies and it
box containing tobacco. guru, candy,

' etc.
Has Flue Christmas Dinner.

“Christmas morning we had tried
potatoes and steak, and tor dinner
mashed spuds, hnc mutton chops,
creamed celery, turnips, pickles, bread
and pumpkin pie. I didn't eat very
heavily because right aiter dinner l
was to play my ﬁrst basketball game
in Frao‘ee. We took trucks to Le Trecy.
where they have a regular size dirt
court inside one oi the aeroplane
hangars. It is there that Huhert Tar-l:-
gart is located, and we had a good
talk ‘together. The game was very
close thruout. i played leit tor-ward.

. At the end oi the ﬁrst halt the other
team hltd us beaten 12-16, but by the
end of the game we iorgod ahead 30—27.
It sure seemed good to play again.

Surprised by Gl'lnnelliilns.
mTorggart said he would come down
to see me Sunday, but you can imag»
ine I was considerably surprised cn

FAMOUS ORGANIST
[TO BE HERE SOON

J oseph Bonnet Will Give Concert
Hera February 10.

Joseph Bonnet, the great French
organ virtuoso, Will be in Griuncll,
Monday. Feb. 10. He is making a
transcontinental tour at this time and
makes a. stop at Grinnell.

h . Bonnet has held the position of
organist in a number of the famous
churches 01' France. When he Was but
fourteen years old he was appointed
organist in the church or st. Nicholas.
Later he won the celebrated post of
organist at the church of st. Eustache
in Paris.

Mr. Bonnet. has a remarkable and
unique memory, his repertoire com-
prising as it does the whole of organ
literature from the early composers to
Liszt, Cesar Franck and his contem—
poraries.

MY. Bennett has done a great deal
to popularize the organ for concert
use in America.

seeing Lieutenant Amos Matthews, '17. l
with him, They came about 11 a, m.
and shaved until the 5:30 train. We
talked of every Grinnell person we
ever knew, I believe, and had a real
reunion. Matty is a second lieuten-
ant in the Ael'o corps and was as-
signed to the 186 squadron at La Trecy
the day after Christmas. He has 350
ctiicial hours of flying, besides many
unrecorded hours. He said he would
gladly take me up some time. and sure
hope I can take the trip, because you
know I wanted to become a -pilot.
Matty hasn’t seen the trout but has
been kept as an instructor. He said
he ran into Red Townsend the other
day. 1 had considerable Grlnnell news
to tell him because of the s. is B.'s
i received.

“I am glad you received my letter
telling or my experiences at the front
hnd arrival at Vieuxhalles. We will
hrohahly be here the rest of JAnuarY-”
