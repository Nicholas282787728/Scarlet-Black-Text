WW W no you, 35w

by Merry Wiesner

Grinnell poses an interesting challenge to
many of the wives oi faculty members.
The size and isolation of the community
mean few opportunities for employment
and little cultural enrichment besides that
otiered by the College. Any woman must
search to find her individual answer to
the question at how to Iulfill her desires
and ambitions, as indeed any person must,
but for ‘faculty wives’, that search may be
harder than usual. '
The women which the SCtB interviewed
have become involved in an amazing number
01 organizations and activitles, most of
these totally unknown to students. Many are
pursuing graduate degrees, either master’s
or doctorates, or tinisningiheir undergrad»
uate education at Grinnell. They teach ele-
mentary school, secondary school or adult
education. They work in business in town,
or in Des Moines and Iowa City. They run
the Reading Lao, the Day Care Center and
countless Brownie and Cub Scout troops.
Many are active in the League at Women
Voters.

Many see Grinnell as a unique place {or
personal enrichment, enabling them to

explore diverse tields of interest and expand
their own talents. They also point to its
safety and warmth as qualities of an ideal
place to raise children Both town and col—
lege offer social life, and most of the women
teel comfortable with and enjoy hoihiaculty
and community contact,

While it might appear that Grinnell could
be a very stiﬂing place {or the highly-edit»
cated woman, one in which she felt her own
particular talents were going unused, the
feeling a! satisfaction with the town is overv
whelming. Often women have changed their
field after moving here, returning to school
to explore areas in which there is employ-
ment in the town, but this has resulted from
a simple change or interest, not out or a
ieeling dl necessity.

The women we interviewed recognize the
shortcomings of Grinnell, but see many
more positive {actors in the balance They
have found the town to be a place where a
woman can have many roles. and feel that
she is making an important contribution--
to her own Children's future, to the com-
munity as a whole, and to her own feeling
at personal fulfillment.
