tions, which have been plagued by a
misunderstanding and time-consuming
bargaining. will resume Jan. 25,

Originally, the Teamsters and the ci»
ty representatives had agreed upon an
11,76 percent pay increase, However.
the Union and city representatives
each deiined such a rdise dillerently,
which led to a misunderstanding and
halted negotiations.

understood un11.7o' percent raise in pay
to be an increase lrom the base viage at

All are per-hour wages

Bill Lyman. Teamster represen-
tative, and Bill Sears. Union member
and one oi the bargaining unit,
calculated the actual percent increases
ror individual base wages, based on an
11.76 percent increase oi the wage
schedule, For instance, [or most oi the
Police Department, there would be an
6.76 percent pay raise, while [or only
three policemen at the very upper end
oi the pay scale, there would be m7
creases as high as 13.95 percent, Fur»
thermore, the one meter attendant
would receive a raise of 10.45 percent.
Although Lyman and Sears calculated
the individual raises three dillei‘ent
ways, the highest average base wage

increase they could rind was approx-
imately 10.20 percent, Jim Spradlmg,
the head negotiator [or the city,
calculated that an 11.76 percent in-
crease oi every base wage would cone
stitute a wage schedule increase oi
13.06 percent.

As a result or these ﬁndings, Lyman
and Sears terminated last minute
negotiations and called ior an arbitra-
tion or the contract. Subsequently. the
city‘s alter or an 11.76 percent wage
schedule increase was unanimously
voted down by Union members on Jan.
11.

According to the Grinnell Herald-
Register oi Jan: 12, Lyman commented
that the local would allow the city "one
more opportunity" to correct the cone
tract. "As Iar as I'm Concerned, we
have an agreement for a wage settle-
mentoi 11,76 percent. ii niey don't want
to accept that, they can go to arbitra—
tion and we'll ask [or more.“ Lyman
also threatened a uniformed picket of
the City Council meeting on Jan. 19, but
no such picket materialized.

Few singles for returning students

by Ellen Heath

Contrary to rumors currently cir-
culuting around campus, the dorms are
not overcrouded this semester.
However. there is a lack ol single
rooms

One hundred students returned lrom
olircampus study programs this past
ueek undullhdve been accomodated on
campus. However. approximately 2u
Juniors vlho vldnted singles had to move
into doubles

'l‘here is a shortage oi singles because
many oi the students who left last
semester were in doubles in past
years. Susan \Mltpenn. director o1
housing. has tried not to put relurning
Juniors into doubles with people they

did not know, but she said it is dilficult
to predict whether that will he possible
each semester.

Very leVl singles were given to
ireshmen and sophomores and the rest
were assigned randomly to the return-
ing students. said Wittpenn. A few
singles were created from double
room

1 is semester more spaces were
available [or men than lor women. Wit-
tpenn said she is not certain oi the
reason lor the unevenness but thought it .
may be that more men lrom doubles
lelt lor ollrcdmpus programs than did
women. All at the oil-campus housing is
lull and there is a lengthy “alting list.
