What’s the biggest problem face
ing the residents of Earth today?
Increasingpovcrty and famine’! The
greenhouse effect? Nuclearwaste'!
_A shortage of landﬁlls and clean
beaches? It seems clear to me that
every oneof these issues is dwarfed
by their underlying common fac-
tor—unchecked human population
A growth and the accompanying
concept that economic growth is
good.
Just how serious is the growth
problem? According to one esti»

people: that’s binhs
minusdeaths! EVERYONE should
be concerned about this ﬁgure and
not just the denizen of the Third
World countries, At the present
rate of growth, the population within
U.S, boundaries can expect to in-

_ crease by lﬁperoent between 1989
and the year 2000!

One ofthc greatest obstacles in
the way of limiting (or even berter,
stopping) population growth is the
growth paradigm built into both
Marxist and capitalist economic
theories These theories imply that
growth is agoodthing,andthatitis
seemingly impossible to have too
much of a good thing. But what is
not stressed is the cost of growth.
Economists claim our economy is

’ doing well when the gross national
product (GNP) is steadily increas
ing, But since the cost of the GNP
growth is not measured, we cannot
know ifit is beneﬁcial. Moreover,
an increase in GNP serves asa poor

subtract them," says Herman Daly,
author of Steady State Economics.

Controlling both
human population and physical
growth can begin with US! On the
population issue, Grinnell College
is to be commended for proposing
to insuill condom machines. But
we also should address the eco—
nomic growth that facilitates popu-
lation growth.

The college needs to seriously
considerand developanenrollment
policy setting permanent limits on
student numbers. No such policy
has been publicly stated; instead
we seem to be gradually increasing
our enrollment. in the fall of 1978
there were 1,243 full-time degree
and non-degree students enrolled;
last fall there were 1280 students.
Ifany sort ofcap on student enrolle
ment is absent, we may in essence
have a growth policy!

lfthe college continues to grow,
it will face unnecessary costs as-
sociated with efforts to continually
coordinate the balance amongst
additional students, faculty, and
facilities. Perhapsoureffortseould
be spent better elsewhere. The
adoption of growth-limit policies
for the college should be a state-
ment that our institution will not
acceptthecurrentgrowth-maniaas
a means for improvement.

And my sister pounced, wrest-
ing the magnifier from my hands. I
rolled, but she sat heavy on my
chest. forcing me to gasp ribs, and
she pinned my head between her
knees, She was stronger, had one
of my arms trapped under her foot
and the other clamped to the pave-
ment by her forearm.

And she steadied the glass. The
tiny point focused on my righteye
