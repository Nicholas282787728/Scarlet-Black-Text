The program tor Ellis on Frir
clay was one of the Senior pro-
grams under the management of
Ruth Field. Mrs. Vittllm opened
the meeting with a very pleasing
vocal solo. As an introduction
to the program illustrated later.
Miss Bertha Peck gave something
of the lite and works of Friedrich
Frocbel, the founder of the mods
ern kindergarten. He emphasized
the function of the home” as an
educator and in that centered all
his interests and best efforts. Per
haps he felt the need of home
training more keenly, since he
was deprived or it very early in
his youth. Miss Barnes explained
the methods of kindergarten work,
giving the signiﬁcance ot some of

garleii. The songs. games and

rnentwei-cccrtainly most realis-

Field rend selections from Kate
Douglass VVlggills' charming little
story, “Patsy,” in a pleasing way.

The program was in every way
a perfect success, and the little
people ot thc kindergarten should
be praised for their successful im-
itation under their teachers, Miss
Field and her assistant, Miss
Woodtord.
