The Creature from the
Black Lagoon--3D

by Brian Strause

Generally panned by critics
(who have probably never been
trapped in rural Iowa and been
desperate for entertainment), The
Creature from the Black Lagoon -
- 3D has been condemned as
"unpersuasive and unsuspenseful
honor hokum from the bottom
drawer of imagination", Howv
ever. do not be moved by such
mindless dribble. Someone must
have liked this ﬁlm, otherwise it
would not have spawned two sea
quels. Following this same line

of reasoning the Friday the 13lh
saga should soon be up for an
Academy Award, or more appro~
priately, a People's Choice
Award. Anyhow. with regard to
such a film, context is every-
thing. and the ideal context for
3D is a drunken forum of mind-
less chaos. So strap on those
goggles early, before iLs too late
to tell a difference. or go see The

The Graduate

by Kimberly Eckart

Dustin Hoffman gives a clas-
sic performance as college»gradu-
ate Ben in the 1967 mustrsec.
The Graduate.

Ben hasjust returned home and
ﬁnds his overbearing parean sti-
iling as he tries to unsuccessfully
sort out his life. Every viewer
can relate both to Ben's exaspera»
tion as his parents fawn over
their "fine young man," and his
utter contempt of the adult world
he is forced to politely comply
with. Especially typical of the
familial pressure he faces is his
parents' insistence that he date
Elaine Robinson. the daughter of
family friends

As an escape from the ridicur
lous pressure. Ben accepts a

ship, but begins to pursue their

Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne
Bancroft) who ﬁnds their mectr

Ben‘s parents, however, be

job, while he is perfectly content
to loaf around thinking about his
life. He finally concedes to go
out with "nice girl" Elaine, and
discovers he likes her. Mrs.
Robinson possessrvcly threatens
to tell Elaine of their affair. Uni
fortunately, Elaine learns of it,

ﬁlm trying to win her back.

My Life as a Dog

by Meridilh Levy

My Life as a Dog comes to
the campus screens to enlighten
the students of Grinncll. This
1987 Swedish film focuses on a
ten year old boy's perspective of
changing conditions in life over
which he has no control. The
film illuminates the wit and
imagination of a boy who must
come to terms with the trauma of
death while he experiences the
emergence of adolescence. The
director, Lasso Hallstrom, gives
the ﬁlm a sense of progression;
the boy. Ingcmar, deals with his
many losses and changes while
simultaneously leading a spirited
life as a mischievous, endearing
boy. In the eyes of this ten year
old boy. events alter and enrich
life rather than hinder it,

Most of My Life as a Dog

takes place in 1961 in a rural.
Swedish village where lngemar is
sent to live away from his dying
mother and his dog. In this vil-
lage, Hallstrom creates a delight-
ful collage of eccentric characters
and episodes. The humorous.
upbeat tone of the village atmo
sphere, in addition to Ingemar's
indestructible spirit keeps the
ﬁlm from sinking in its potena
Lially heavy topic. Hallstrom cf-
fectivcly intertwines humor and
trauma throughout My Life at a
Dog. He succeeds in decisively
pinpointing depths of life from a
ten year old's perspective.
Perhaps My Life as a Dog
will exhaust your sentimental
tolerance. Nevertheless. the ﬁlm
can be a cleansing offer of a fa-
miliar. yet uplifting perspective.

Running Scared

undercover cops. having resolved
to eradicate all the nasty drug

Billy Crystal and Gregory

licemen pondering an early re-

Key West bar. Yet. they resolved
to abolish drug-warfare from

he was just nervous because it

Nevertheless. cuddle up with

soundtrack of this grubby version
of Miami Vice goes Midwestem.
