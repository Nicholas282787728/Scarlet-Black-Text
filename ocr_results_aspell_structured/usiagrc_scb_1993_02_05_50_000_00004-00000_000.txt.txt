First Amendment Symposium
Freedom of Speech

Should be

very new idea needs a dis-
E senter," said Robert Peck,
who defended all forins of
freedom of speech in his Convoca-
. tion address Thursday.

Citing the “seamlessncss” of
speech, Peck asserted that free speech
is necessary to the wellrbeing of our
society, even when such speech is
offensive to certain segments of the
population.

"It’s easy to wax poetic aboutthe
First Amendment... It’s easy to sup-
port free speech in tire abstract,” said
Peck. “However, this support often
evaporates when you go from the ab-
stract to a speciﬁc situation,” he con4
tinued. “We cannot reserve protection
for speech we like."

Peck gave historical examples of
the struggle over free speech, includ-
ing the John Peter Zenger case from
colonial times and the Alien and Sedie
tion Acts prior to Jeffersoniari times.
He also referred to contemporary
struggles over free speech, such as
those over pomegraphy, hate crimes,
and violence on television.

In all cases. Peck reminded his
audience that those who tried to sup
press free speech did so because they

Absolute

were afraid of the ideas it might pro-
mote. Thcy sought to protect the pub
lic from “dangerous" ideas.

“Yes, ideas and speech are danr
gerous,” agreed Peck. “They make
people think, they challenge the status
one.” He asserted, however. that such
challenges are beneﬁcial both to indi-
viduals and to society in general.

Peck said that free expression is a
privilege which helps us realize who
we are. It serves as a safety valve

through which people can express ’

themselves,rathcrthanactingoutthcir
hatredsand grievances on othcrpcople.
Without free speech therc is no way of
educating people about problems or
addressing these problems, said Peck.

In relation to hate cn‘mcs, Peck
argued that although the crime itself
should bepunished, the mindset could
not be punished. “You can’t prohibit
racismiit doesn‘t empower people.
and it doesn't solve the problem."

“The remedy to speech we don’t
like is more speechispeech we do
like." said Peck. “Every time you Sup~
press speech, there’s a cost, which you
don’t always see."

Peck is Legislative Counsel at the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU). He is the ACLU‘S principal
spokesperson in Washington on First
Amendment Issues.

HEN can a word make a
sentence three times as

an ethnic slur and the sentence is a
prisonsentence.“Asthcopcningllncs
of Susan Gellman’s speech entitled,
“Is Racism Protected by the First
Amendment?" this riddle rcprcsentcd
the complex issue of hate speech and
criminal punishment mat shc dis
cussed during Wednesday’s Speech.

A member of die Antercf’dmltr
lion League of B’nai B’rith and the
American Civil Liberties Union,
Gellman, the Assistant State Public
Defender for Ohio , admitted that she
was on both sides of the issue of
whetherlegislationthatrvouldstiffcn
penalties for crimes motivated by
racial, religious, national or sexual
discrimination should be instituted in
state legislatures.

Gellman pointed out that the ac-
tual conduct to be legislated against
in the model, is already punishable
by law and only the motive differs,
separate from intent or purpose and
does not constitute a crime itself.

Hence.shearguedthatthelcgislation
punishes droughts, which is incon-
sistent with the first amendment. “Is
racism protected by the First Amend-
ment? ch, protected it is,“ said
Gellman.

'I'hcspcakcrwentontostaiethat
although racism could sometimes be
cotnbatcd under existing lawisuch
asinthccascofracialcprthetsusedas
“ﬁghtingwords"—ihc“impactofofr
fcnsivc beliefs and opinions are still
ideas,” and racisin cannot easily be
fought under the law without violat-
ing the first amendment.

In the Second part of her talk.
Gollmari discussed the lnefllcicncy
of a legislated anti—racism policy.
“Laws don‘t accomplish much on tr
practical level,” she stated. Slre pro-
posed neutral alterntitlvcs to the
ADL‘s antirracism legislation con-
sisting of phrases such as “intent to
create terror” that would cover other
non»racial events such as driverby
shootings andcomputervimses.Stat-
ing that “real solutions are less ape
pealing," Gellman proposed “incen-
tives,cducation andexample" to more
effectively combat racism.

that position, Frohnmayer received
strong negative public reaction due
to his support of controversial art.
Hrs speech stressed the importance
of following the First Amendmentin
tolerating the funding of controver-
sial artand the significantrole ofttrc
artist in American culture.

Frohnmayer, having been N'EA
chair from 198992, was fired by
former President Bush due to pres-
sure from incensed Americans come
plaining of their tax money going to
support offensive art, especially that
of Robert Mapplethorpe, whose art is
on exhibit in Burling Library.

Labelling himself as a First
Amendment radical, Frohnmayer rer
layed to the standing»room-only
crowd his feeling that “individual
rights precede the government" and
censorship is inconsistent. leading to
“the most shameful chapters of our
history." As to the question of tax-
payers supporting offensive art, he
siated”the governmentdoesn’thave
to be in the arts business at all, but if
it is, ithas toplay with an even hand.“

“Theartist’scalllng is to helpus
understand what we are about as hu»
man beings," stated Frohnmayer, later
referring to the artist as a scientist in
search of truth about the human cone
dition. According to the speaker, this
often includes the most unpopular
ideas, whether the American taxpay—
ers are offended by them or not. He
cited examples of Don erdman's
FirsChrist,whichdisplaysacrucifix
submerged ina vatofurinc and David
Wannarout’s portrayalofChristwith
asyringein his arm, twoof the works
thtit led to his firing.

Frohnmayer also praised con-
troversial arts by noting the lack of
discussion in thcAmerican cultureas
a whole, blaming television and in—
sisting dial “arts are an avenue to
provoke dialogue and understand
these who are different.”

Since his firing, Frohnmayer has
written a book entitled Leaving Town
Alive: Confession: D/An Art Warrior,
describing his experiences with the
NBA and the "obscene art” uproar.
