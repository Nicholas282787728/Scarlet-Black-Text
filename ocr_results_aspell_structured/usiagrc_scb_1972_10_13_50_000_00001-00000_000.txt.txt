FRIDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1972

 

Gorrell lumbasts HP’s, Plugs lSPIRG

by Terry Woli
Assistant student Coordinator Curt
Gorrell has resigned his position

eiiective immediately, student
Coordinator Ciaig Kugisakiane

nounced this week. Gorrell, who
is coordinator of college media for
ISPIRG and representative of the
Communications Department to the
Humanities Division EPC, told the
5&3 Wednesday that a “shift in priv
orities" had caused him to make

the decision.

“It was my feeling that lwas not
giving the commitment i should be
giving as an Assistant Coordinator
both in the projects l had under-
taken in Craig’s office and also as
a vital functioning part of the Cat)-
inet.”

Early in the year, Gorrell was as
signed the task or helping students
Mary Jane Wynn and Karen Auer-
bach set up a Grinnell chapter oi
ISPIRG. When the necessary sighar
tures and money was Collected, Gor-
rell stayed on as SGA liaison with
the Grihnell ISPIRG group. In time,
his interest and activity expanded
beyond the scope of his SGA role.
Gorrell was torn between his work
for SGA and ISPIRG, but the latter
offered him something the Coore
dinator’s office could not. “I hadthis
focal point in ISPlRG talking about
housing projects in Des Moines and
things that really aiiected people’s
lives, where i really had an input
for the knowledge I had,”

GDrrell said he was “afraid that
Craig and Greg were taking some of
the burden from me.” Accordingly,
he had told Craig to “ ‘Kick me
when I need it."l was beginningeto
get the feeling that [needed a kick
too oiten and that i simply didn't
have the time in terms or my com—
mitment to lSPlRG, which has exs
padded to‘ the point that it domir
hates my priorities.”

Gorrell mentioned that he had

Board Elections received low

ceived 74% of the votes cast
ior all-campus EPC. Carol
Moulder, female collegeowned,

lege owned and Shri Vankate-
san, male college owned were

tatives.

Curl Gorrell

brought up his connicis or interest
at a Cabinet meeting about a week
and a hull ago. “in view oi the fact
that a third Coordinator was being
hired,” Gorrel said he decided that
it would be an appropriate time to
oiier his resignation.

According to Kugisaki, Gorrell’s
resignation came to the Cabinet as
something of a surprise, but he said
he was aware that Curt’s extra com~
mitments were becoming “quite a
strain." in his work with ISPIRG
and in the handling oi student com
plaints, Gorrell did “very good
jobs," Kugisaki told the son. ”The
work was thorough and complete.”

Grinnell’s local lSPlRG chapter held a meeting to mobilize student
support and define research projects to be undertaken in the local come
munity on Thursday, October 5. Low cost housing and the establishment
oi a rent code in Grinnell were chosen as local points ior ISPIRG studies.
Rob Rainer, Michele Rothenberg, and Laurie Seidel-are heading the ISPIRG
task iorce examining the issue oi low cost housing. Several proposals
are currently being discussed by the Grinnell Low Cost Housing Bureau,
which was denied iunding irom HUD last year ior a low cost housing pres
ject tor the elderly. This year two basic tacts are being considered by

the Bureau. the development oi a complex ior elderly persons, or a housing

project ior low income iamilies,

“It’s a myth that poverty doesn’t
exist in the area,” said Koren
Auei-bach, Grinnell's acting State
Board representative, She cited lie
gures indicating that 612 iamilies
in Grinnell alone earn less than
$3,000 per year The ISPIRG re-

proposals beiore the LowCost House

Organic Dinner: Success

livinssiiatauuiiiei

students were generally pleased
with the natural foods dinnerserved
by SAGA last Monday, a survey
taken following the dinner has re-
vealed, and 75% would like to see
SAGA serve natural foods more ofs
ten.

44% of the students who filled out
survey forms said that the appear
ance of the natural food was about
the same as the usual SAGA fare,
but 53% thought the natural iood
tasted better and 50%thoughthev‘dr-
iety was better. Only 2311/, or the
respondents disapproved or the
taste; 15% did not like the variety,
Jerry Stanly, memberoiLEAPwho
organized the natural ioods dinner,
thinks that the meal Went over well
The possibility of natural foods at
SAGA in the future, however, is unv
certain “For this dinner they threw
cost out the window, biltll'om now on
they will only do things ilthe cost
is competitive," he Said. The hest
possibility Stanly sees for another
all-natural foods dinner in lhe m,
ture would be on Earth Day next
Spring,

LEAP, however, is presently Con»
ducting a study of the possible sour-
ces of natural foods and the costs
which would be involved, in the

hopes that SAGA can at least be—
gin serving a few more natural
ioods dishes during the regular
meals, At present SAGA serves sev-
erzil natural foods as condiments,
and occasional organically raised
vegetables and chicken.

Eventually the aim is to have a
natural {odds selection available at
every meal “Hopefully,"Slahly told
the 5&5, “we can make recomr
mendalions to SAGA hy ilie end ol
the semester.”

LEAP is also undertaking a study
of the SAGA food service itself,
checking the present supplies at
food. the labels, recipes, which
SAGA uses, and the methods oi food
preparation at the two dining halls.

Natural ioods, according to stnhly,
are eaten as close as possible to
their nalul'éil state, Fruits, veger

Michele Rothenberg is taking
charge of El second ISPIRG task
force, a group studying prices and
living conditions in apartments
rented in the Grinnell area. Ms,
Rothenberg also plans to play an
instrumental role in iormulating a
rent Code for Grinnell “As of now,
if you rent an apartment in Grin-
nell, you, as a tenant, have noguar-
nnteed consumer prolectlon," noted
Ms, Auel‘bach,

Although the local Grinnell chap—
ter is gaining momentum, leader—
ship and supportive roles tor slur
dents who wish to participate
in lSPlRG on ii local or state level
are by no means closed all. Ms.
Auel'bach stressed lhe need for more
volunteers to become active in

EPC Ponders Academic Issues

by John Wylie

Members of the All College EPC
held their first meeting of the semr
ester. yesterday to discuss issues
ranging irom n credit/lail option
under the new grading system to (lie
possibility oi altering the credit
limit per department that is cur
rently applicable to n Grinnell
degree

According to SGA VicerPresident
Anne Walter, the primary issue til
the first meeting was the possible
establishment of a credit/erase op-
tion as an addition to the new grad-
ing system. The main emphasis ap-
peared to center on an option which
would allow Students to take one or
two courses per semester on n
credit/erase basis.

The option would allow a grade to
be recorded, and “retrieved" nl ii
luler date if the student so (lee
sired However, a student would be
prevented lrom switching back and
forth from l.‘ credit to :i grade l)ns15
during the semester

Another issue Which lhe Committee
is tackling is the current linilt oil
the number oi credits per tleparr
ment which a student may count to
wards his Grinnell degree. Ullderthe
current regulations, a student may
count no more than 48 credits in
any one department towards gl‘aillmr
tion. Additional credits may he tllken
in a department, but they will not
be counted in calculating the sine
dent’s progress towards graduation

Additional credits may be taken
department, but they will not be

Counted lIl Calculating the student's
progress towards graduation. Met-
hurls of extendlng this limit to, per-
linps. sixty credits are being dis
cussed.

Members of the EPC will be the
major coordinators and imple—
lllentel‘s in conducting the All Cole
lege Evaluation. Questionnaires
which were recently issued onbehall
oi the Committee concerning work
study programs, independent study
progrnms. and the length oi time
required to earn a BA degree are
ll first Step in the Evaluation. Stus
dents who have not yet done so are
asked to return the completed forms
lo their House Presidents by Mon-
day so that the members ofthe Com-
mitteo may bcgin to evaluate the
responses,

Consideration is also being given
to .1 plan that Will allow all the
student members of the Divisione
lil EPC'S a full vote. Under lhe .
present system, each Department in
a division sends one student and one
lacully member to the Divisional
EPC, EﬂClI faculty member has one
vote, While the students have a total
01 two volcs, regardless of the numr
tier of student representatives on the
Committee. Aline Walter presenled
ll proposal to the Committee thal
would give every student on the Dl‘
visional EPC‘S one vote

A bake sale held last Saturday gathered over $100 for the local Democra ic Cam-
paign. Political workers also canvassed the lawn Snlul'day, identifying the extent of
Democratic suppnrl in the campus.
