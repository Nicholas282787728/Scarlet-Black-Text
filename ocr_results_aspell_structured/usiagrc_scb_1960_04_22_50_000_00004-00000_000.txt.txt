“Here it is easy tor both
whites and Negroes to become
complacent on the race ques-
tion," Gault said, as he ex-
plained why he and Mullins
hoped that attending the con-
rei-ence would help themdo
their share in esahlishing ra-
cial equality,

Gault said that because he
was ai Negro who had never
experienced the problems of‘
southern living, he wanted to;
get some ﬁrsthand intorrnationl
from some oi those Negroes whoi
have actually lived in the South.

Mullins .said he wanted to find
out where intcgrationists need
help end what'kind oi help
they need so that Grinnell stu~
dents could learn what theyL
might best do. i

And why should we NEED-to

If it is simply a way to have
run 'and the rules are too un-
realistic to be criectivc, then
we’ll have to {see things the

way they are and admit than

there is no.“problem.” But par»
haps this is a problem or the
“atomic age” and the “hopeless-
ness of American youtll”¥we

If this is the case, and all that 1'0" in the project To dmte four

causes that exist are meaningall
less to all of us, perhaps Amer-‘
ica needs a mass “soul-scarch»l
ing" as to aims and ideals. 11,!
however, the problem lies only:

at Grinnell, then let's discoverlten miles south of Taos, N, M.,lselle committee,

'rt and work towards relieving
it. And if anyone else says, “It's
the social situation,” I'll screams

The social situation (what-
ever that means!) arises from
something else, and it seems
to me likely that even inte-
grated campuses and no wom-
en's hours, good as they might
he, won’t change that.

And one word about admi .
sions policy. Grinncll is .an inr
stitution of learning, and it we
ever hope to bowl-lat the schol—
ars hero (on the levels of fan»

ulty, administration and stU-l In last week's Scarlet and three new hair styles during
dents) want us to be, then there ‘

must he more and more ”schol-
ars” accepted.

True students are among thelnow on view in Main hall and ate for

most exciting people in the
world and are otten quite "well-
rounded.” Nothing against atha‘
letes. jags and the wealthy, but
a college is a school, and a
school is for learning, and
learning is for interested and
able peopleVand these are stu»
dents. ..
