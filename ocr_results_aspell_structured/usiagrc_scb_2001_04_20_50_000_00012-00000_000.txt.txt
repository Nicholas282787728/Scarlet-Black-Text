inﬂnr: lh:ii egos ro professional size and
srarr rising rheir eelobriry smriis ro

ball fans like rhe weekend be.
esnso rhey can spend rvvo whole
days sirring in rhe La-Z-Eoy, eats
ing bean dip and complaining hovv ir eonld have been rhem in
rhe drair if ir hadn’t been for rhrr careerrendlng broken roe in

bur more nnpormnrly, 1 like rho dmir because is give me an
excuse ro do a mook drolr. Mosr moek drnﬁs yon see rry ro
predier rhe ﬁrsr round or rwo of pieks, based on expert analyr

First round: wnyne Grerzky, haekay suprrsrsr. They mil
him rhe Grrnr Olic for n rossori. I'm prerry snre rliar reason has

No matter how good they may do this
weekend, no NFL team will be able to
match my performance in the drafts Of
course their draft will have the slight ad-
vantage of being based in reality, so maybe
instead of being too smug, I’lljust go back
to my bean dip

done, Valcri also mode ir ro rhe NHL, rhan saw Candilcc
Cameron us 1).]. on “Full House" one day aﬁer a nap. He was
so mkcn with rhe actress rhnr he somehow rraoked her down
and nsked heronr, rhen ended up mnrrying henThat's the kind
of iniriarive l wear on rho renm, and mm ivhy Valcn is also

7 rheir bends are bigger rhnii rherr bieeps, nnd rlnrr‘s siying
somerhing On rhe orher hnnd, rhey are borh superb :llhlcms
and rhey can keep Green in line. Their invimrions ro rhe (cam
barbeeue ivill irisr be losr in m: mnil every year.

No mirrer how good rhey may do rhis weekend, no NFL
team vvill be able ro mareh my performnnee in rhe dmﬁ. or
eonrso rheir draﬁ will have rhe slighr ndvanmge ofbeing hosed
in renlrry, so miybr insrord oiboing roo smug, l'll iusr go back
ro my bun dip.
