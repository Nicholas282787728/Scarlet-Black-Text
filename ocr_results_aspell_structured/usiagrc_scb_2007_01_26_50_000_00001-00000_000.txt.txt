SGA
Treas.
resigns

BY ABBY RAPOPORT
over Winter Break, Mnry
Powell '07 resigned from her

position as SGA Treasurer.

Former Asst. Treasurer Brad
Bishop '08 will take over her
duties as treasurer.

Powell said in an e-marl
that she “resigned due to per-
sonal matters.” According to
SGA president Chris Hall
’07, Powell discussed her den
cis‘ion with members of the
Cabinet well before anything
was finalized. Because there
was no pressing need for a
decision, l—Iall told Powell she
could let him know her deci-
sion over break.

“I know it was a difﬁcult
decision for her to make," said
Hall. “She did u great job [as
Treasurer]."

After Powell’s announcer
ment, half-way into Winter
Break, Bishop and Hall began
working to adjust to the situ-
ation, “We wanted to ﬁgure
out the best way that Cabinet
didn’t feel overwhelmed," said
Hall. “Everyone it might im-
pact had a proper headssup."
Bishop began working over
the break to prepare for the
transition,

The SGA treasurer n01"
mally spends two years work-
ing with SGA frnnnces, one
as assistant treasurer and the
next as full treasurer. If SGA
were to hire an assistant trea-
surer this semester. she would
have a two and a half year
commitment. According to
Bishop, this increases the per
tential for burnrout; for this
reason, SGA chose not to hire
a new Assistant Treasurer un-
til next year.

This situation is not un-
precedented. Two years ago,
Treasurer Doja
'05 resigned and Matt Cle-
inmru‘r Y06 took over his role.
Because the switch will take
place at the beginning of the
semester, Bishop believes it
Will be smoother than had it
happened midway through a
semester, as was the case for
Cleinmau.

Bishop is not worried
about his new role. “In some
ways, it's easier with one per-
son handling all the data," he
said. "There aren't two sys-
tems of noterraking and you
handle all the data."

Hall shares this optimism
“I’m not worried at all about
Brad," he said.

KDIC returns to campus Feb. 5

By DAVID LOGAN

After a fall semester plagued by logistical and technical rlrfs
ficulties, KDIC, Grinnell’s campus radio station, is scheduled
to resume operation on Feb, 5, according ro station manager
Daniel Furutir ’08.

After relocating the station from last year's space in younker
Fit to the new location in the JRC, the station needed to com-
pletely move and reinstall the equipment and music. A primary
difficulty, according to KDIC emails sentover the course oflast
semester, was the inability to get a technician to connect the
equipment,

The mounting delays eventually resulred in KDIC enncel—

ling operations for the entire semester. "I! was kind ofa gradual
thing," said Josh Tcrenbrurn '10, who had been approved for a
fall show. “They kept postponing it on a weekly basis."

This semester, the station is almost ready. The equipment
will be completely operational soon and rhere are only seine
boxes ofCDs left to unpack. Students who had been approved
for shows in the fall semester must reapply for the spring and
submit their applications by Jan. 31.

Some students were frustrated about the difficulties. Asa
Wilder '10, who was slated to have a show, said the process
was particularly frustrating for ﬁrst-years who had not had or

Cyclone hits campus in two weeks

rsv BEN WEVL

IfGrinnellians can expect anything tor certain (in addition
to death and taxes), it's that Gnuucll's yearbook, TIN Cyclone,
will be late. Very late,

77]! Cyclone Corbditor Evan Pctrie '07 said the yearbook
should arrive rn two weeks, nearly four rnonrhs later than origi-
nally expected. Petrie pointed to a combination of publisher»
related problems and the sheer amount of work as reasons for
the setback.

Petrie began putting the 1927page yearbook together with
Co-Editor Justin Riley '06 shortly after last year's commence
ment ceremony. l’ctric and Riley hoped to finish the yearbook
by the end ofjuly when Riley was to travel abroad, but they did
nor. “We were making pretty good progress on rt," Petrie said
“but unfortunately it didn't‘happen."

Patric said that between half and two-thirds of the year»
book ms still incomplete when Riley letr. Pctric continued to
work alone, coming to Grinnell two weeks early in an effort to
frnish before the school year, “I thought in worked pretty sol-
rdly for 2 weeks 1 could finish it ,, 150 hours or so to actually
finish it,"Petrie said.

Unfortunately, the new publications room in the JRC went
without working computers until the second week ofclasses. At
that point, Petrie said, he wasn't able to continue working on

the yearbook for the 1042 hours a day he was able to devote
over the summer. “It bccarne harder with a full course load and
two seminars," he said, "When it had to contend with getting

_ work done for classes, it ended up having to be drawn out for u

long period oftime."

Pctric said that Riley’s departure made it harder to frnish
the yearbook, not because the job is too big {or one person, but
because oflogrstienl problems such as locating some of Riley's
frlcs.

But, according ro Petlic, the many hurdles laid out by the
publisher, Walsworth Publishing, based in Marceline, MO.
posed an even larger obstacle. “I ran into a lot of pretty small
technical problems that worrld hold me up from getting any
work done on it for days or a week at a time," Petrie said.

“The big problem was nor with getting the book created
but the little things that came tip with finalizing things with
the printer which I wasn’t as well prepared with. Justin had
more experience with those issues.“

Student Publications And Radio Committee (SPARC)
business manager Eric Omwega '08 said he had limited email
communication with Petrie at the beginning of last semester.
SFARC publishes and oversees all student publications, and
while it is an elected group with a budget ofabout $150,000, it
has a low profile on campus. Omwcga said the group and re-

Student
shot by
pellet gun

av ABBY RAPOPORT

on Wednesday evening,
Sarah Lu ’07 was shot with
what is believed to be a pellet
gun on Eighth Ave. The ear,
with the perpetrator inside,
then sped off.

Within a few hours, Di-
rector or Safety and security
Stephen Briscoe sent out an
all campus bulletin, explain-
ing the situation and describ-
ing the suspect. The student
was not injured because a
scarfaround her neck blocked
the pellet. According to Cape
t~ain Tim Sittig, campus secu,
rity is now working with the
Grinnell Police Department
to “narrow the field” to find a
suspect.

After sending out the bul-
letin, Briscoe soon received
e-mails from others with in—
formation. One member of
the college wrote to say that
she had seen the same truck
parked on Eighth Ave. late at
night last semester.

“I don't know what’s hap-
pening, if he’s casing the area
or what," Briscoe said.

In another email to
Emma, a student described
jogging with friends when a
black pickup truck stopped.
A man got out with what ap
peared to be a gun and then
shot it into a ditch. It was
only at this point the students
realized it was in fact a pellet
gun.

According to Briscoe,
sales of pellet guns have re-
cently surged. “We've had
quite a few ofthern that we've
taken off students," he said.
The pellet guns can be as
powerful as .22 pistols and are
often not easily distinguished
from a real gun. “That’s what
makes them so dangerous,”
said Btiscoe.

Chase Martyn '07 knows
how much a pellet gun can
hurt. Two years ago, he was
walking back from ARH
around midnight when a car
drove by and shot a pellet gun
at him. Martyn called secu-
rity and soon gave a state-
ment to the police He was
also not injured, thanks to a
Windbreaker jacket, but he
did have a “small welt" from
where the pellet hit. Two
days later, he rode through
Grinnell in a squad car, look
ing for the car. They found it
in a driveway, and after idens
