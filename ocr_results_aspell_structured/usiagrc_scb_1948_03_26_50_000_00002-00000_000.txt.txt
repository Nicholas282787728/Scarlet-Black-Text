Let's Re-Defirle Positions

According to the new Student Council
constitution, “The Student Council shall'be
the supreme student governing body”, and
furthermore, it shall ”determine policy and
make regulations affecting the entlre stu-
dent body.” We have assumed that such
has always been the case, and yet the
theory has not been c'ar 'ed into practice.

For example, this winter's tour of con—
ference colleges was not conducted by the
Student Council, but by the C of H_P and
the League Board; yet it was certalnly a
matter which affected the student bodyas
a whole. It had little to do with discipline
or hall life. The obvious vehicle for such an
investigation was the Student Council, Why
was the Student Council bypassed?

We know what the Student Council
does; its duties are plainly listed. The same
is true for the C of HP and the League
Board. Unfortunately, however, not all stun
dent problems fit precisely into either cat-

. egory; between them there is a_no-man’s
land of undefined function. In‘ such cases
the ball is carried by the stronger organiza—
tion, whichever that may be. ,

The Student Council should be what
it claims to be. It is inevitable under the
circumstances that the two governing
bodies from the north and south cam-
puses should elicit a strong pull from the
central authority which the Student
Council represents. And yet there is defr
inite need for a more accurate defination
of their relationships. .

There are matters which .can and
should be handled by the Student Council,
such as the one cited above. There are
others in which some degree of cooperation
among the three is necessary; we have
not entirely forgotten the fracas in ARI-l
last fall. And finally the ordinary problems
of discipline should be left to the individual
halls and their combined chairmen. Through
this last year the authority of the C of HP
and League Board has percolated up
through all three categories, leaving the
Student Council feeling rather unnecessary
at times.

By Monday night we will have elected
all three of the top leaders for next year,
and we will be ready fora fresh start.
Much will depend, in the absence of clearly-
defined relationships, upon how much the
people in question want to cooperate.
Precedent can be stronger than the wrlt-
ten word. Here’s hoping they find a way
to lead us out of the tangle.

In the course of the long discussion
necessary to modify women‘s smoking rules
the question arises: Are Grinnell women
sociable?

This question is not .pure rhetoric but

one of lifting sociability from the realms of
Merrill park or other impromptu parties
and arriving at the grim problem of the
parlor.

We grant (or would like to grant) the
fact that the parlors plovide a much
needed place for study. But this practi-
cal function is the minor element,of the
problem. We prefer to consider the
aesthetic functionitllat of fostering in»
dividual friendships and cottage unity.
And in this light we must heed the hue
and cry that now arises from our midst
ithat sociability has been on the decline
since the institution of the recent ex-
periment permitting room smoking.

Somehow when a three or fivesdollar
fine was the motivating force against room
smoking everyone was just as friendly and
congenial as could be. Those ”shared cig~,
arettes” were certainly the incentive for
interest in our fellow beings and those
smokers were the greatest personality mold-
ers since Dale Carnegie. .

However, change has come and, whil
we’ve liked it, we still feel a lack. We just
have to get back to those parlors to be con-
genial. /

The cur 'ent groans and gripes are ac- ‘
complishing nothing and indicate only one
thingia failing in ourselves. For it is l
pathetic to realize, nluch less admit, that
one’s array of social graces consists mere-
ly of flicking ashes communally when
forced to do so.

It necessai y follows, if Grinnell women]
demand that_our parlors be open at all times
for companionship or occasional study, they
should be ready to prove that pleasant com—
munity living is possible without enforced
socializing.
