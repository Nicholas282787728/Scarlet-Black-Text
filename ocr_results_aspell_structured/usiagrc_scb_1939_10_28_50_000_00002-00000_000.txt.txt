STUDENTtiOVEHNMENT N0. 1

With this issue the Scarlet and Bloch begins
a series of editorials upon the Grinnell syse
teln of student participation in government.

This series is being 'rltten as an impor-
tant development in this newspaper’s policy
to help make this campus a better place for
the Grinnell student. And it‘ is prompted
by the sincere belief that a clarification
and reorganization of our system of student
participation in government is a vital step
in the successful fulfillment of the policy.

Thevfirst of these editorials is an analy-
sis of that plan as it now stands. The
second will attempt to point out the dis—
advantages of the present system and the
causes of those.disadvantages. And the
third editorial will present a program dee
signed to remove the disadvantages by elim-
inating their causes,

Today our purpose is to examine the
Grinnell system of student palticipation in
government as it is at present.

G .

‘At the outset, it may be well to dispel
a certain misconception which exists in the
student mind concerning what is commonly
known as student government. That is a
misnomer. The Grinnell system is one of
student participation in government. That
is the way the system is set up; that is the
way it is supposed to be.

It is not a plan of student government;
it‘is not a system of faculty government;
it is a program of cooperative government.

It is with the students‘ pait in that sys-
tem that these editorials are concerned,
And it is the organization and the powers
of the bodies representing the students in
this plan that we are interested in today.

G
Tllm'd are three major groups participating
in government on the Grinnell campus: the
Student Council, the Council of House Pre»
sidents, alid the executive board of the Wo-
men’s Self-Government association.

The Student Council is composed of two
classes of members, the ex-officio members
and the executive committee,

The executive committee is composed of
the president of the council, the social chair—
man, the student auditor, two upperclass
women from the student body at large,
and the presidents of the Council of House
Presidents and the Women’s Executive
Board. These representatives are chosen
in a variety of ways.

The president of the council is elected
by the whole student body at a final elec-
tion after two nominating elections and

takes office in the latter part of the second
semester. This same procedure is followed
in the selection of the two Women repre-
sentzltives,

The assistant social chairman is elected

‘ at the time of the filial ballot for the pre

sident and women representatives, and he
becomes social chairman at the beginning
of the second school year after his election,
serving the intervening year as assistant
social chairman. However, he becomes a
member of the faculty committee on stud-
ent social affairs during the spring of the
first year after his election.

The student auditor is elected at the
same time as the assistant social chairman,
taking office immediately, Both the ass
sistant social chairman aiid the auditor are
chosen from nominations by the outgoing
council. The presidents of the League
Board and the Council of House Presidents
are on the council by vil'ture of their posi»
ticns.

The conduct of the routine business of
the council lies in the hands of the exccu—
tire committee, and the ex»officio members
vote upon certain questions of major im-
portance. The cx-officio members include
the presidents of the YMCA, the WAA, the
men's Honor “G”, the editor of the Scarlet
mill Black, and all elected representative of
the town men and women,

The stated powers of the council include
the allocation of the semester fee and the
organization of committees to supervise
student chapel, the White House, pep, social
affairs, and auditing. The last two coni-
mittees are headed by the social chairman
and the auditor, respectively, who are paid
for their services.

G.

The Council of House Presidents is com—
posed of the presidents of the men’s halls
and of the Town Men’s association, The
dean of men is an advisory member. The
presidents of all the men’s halls except
Carney and Macy houses are elected by the
residents of the halls. The presidents of
the off-campus dormitories are elected by
the Council of House Presidents, the town
men electing their own president.

With the exception of the presidents of
Macy and Carney, who take office at the
beginning of the school year, the members
of the Council of House Presidents assume
their duties after the spring vacation.

The Council of House Presidents has
the power to make all regulations necessary
to the proper conduct of the men in the
college, to administer these laws, and to
establish judicial machinery to deal with
their violation.

G

The executive board of the Womcn’ Self-
Government association is the administra-
tive and judicial body of the women stud—
eiits of Grinnell.

It is composed of the president of the
board, the house chairman of each cottage,
and the chairman of the town women. The
dean of women is an advisory member. The
president is elected by all the women of the
school from the three women receiving the
largest number of votes in a primary elec-
tion. The house chairmen are elected from
the eleven candidates receiving the great-
est number of nominating votes.

The members of the board assume their
duties at the beginning of the college year,
being elected the preceding spring.

The board has the power to supervise
the funds of the women, make provisions
for the enforcement of regulations, and to
exercise the judicial functions of revoca—
tion of privileges and recommendation of
suspension for malefactors. The board ad-
ministers the social funds through its
standing Social Budget committee composed
of the president of the Executive Board,
the treasurer of the board, a member of
the board, a social chairman elected from
the cottage social chairmen of the current
and previous years, and the quadrangle
treasurer, elected by the old and new exe-
cutive boards. The dean of women is an
advisory member.

G

Next Friday. the secoml in this series of
editorials will deal with the disadvantages
of this system and the cause of those disad-
vantages '
