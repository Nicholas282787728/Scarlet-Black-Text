Dombrowskl
resigns as

grid couch

by left Raymond

Prior to last Saturday’s game against
Carleton, Head Football Coach Ed Dom-
browski announced to a gathering of team
members that he was stepping down as
head coach after the game.

Dombrowski chose not to comment last
Tuesday when asked for his reasons for
resigning the position. “it's a very per
sonal thing when you make decisions like
that," he stated. He denied that he had [ell
any outside pressure to resign.

The resignation does not affect Dom-
browski’s present status as softball coach
or as assistant professor of physical educa-
tion. He has no immediate plans to move
on.
Grinnell President George Drake said
that John Martinek, assistant grid coach
and head baseball coach at the college.
will succeed Dombrpwski. Martinek is also
an associate professor of biology working
in the GrinnelleRush Medical Studies Pro-
gram. Drake said that Martinek will begin
his head coaching duties immediately in
preparation for the 1983 grid season.

Dombrowski admitted that this year’s
football squad did not improve over the
course of the season, although he said that
there were several individual im-
provemenis.

On the whole, Dombrowski said that he
had had an enjoyable tenure as head
coach. “I‘ve enjoyed myself and my ex-
periences here,” he said.

The Pioneers finished the 1982 season
with a H3 record after losing 62-34 at
Carleton. Dombrnwski leaves his position
with an overall 5-29 record and a con-
ference mark of +21 over four years.

Gene Reid:'ls it really the coach's fault?‘

by Gene Reid

In the four years that l have played with
or watched the many different athletic
teams that Grinnell College fields, I have
somehow gained a new perspective on me
responsibilities that the coach of a team
can be held accountable for. Maybe I am
the confused player/spectator in this situa
tion, but I would like to state my case
nevertheless.

When I arrived at Grinnell in August of
1979, l was still in my old state of mind that
college football would be a competitive,
learning and growing experience. Grinnell
seemed to be the perfect place for me. i
was told that a student’s classes and
grades were of first importance, and if the
student had the time, football would pro»
Vide a much needed release of tensions.

over a four-year period.

The reason why I feel the need to write
this article is because from my first loss in
August of 1979 until my final football game
for Grinnell College (which was a loss).
I’ve heard my teammates say that, “It's
the coach‘s fault" {or all the losses mat
have been accumulated by Grinnell.

Football is not the only sport that has
been “cursed" with good coaches. In three
years of spectatlng, I have seen the basket-
ball team here compile an overall 5761
record. One basketball coach was fired in
the 197980 season after he compiled a
record or 0-22. Can 22 losses really be the
coach’s fault?

The same symptoms are present on the
football team. I wonder if this type of

 

‘I do not think that the players
will take responsibility for
anything they do anymore.’

 

At this point I was not aware of the fact
that Grinnell College's football team did
not possess the power, or shall we say the
right, to advise those persons who would
be at a disadvantage'on the football field to
try one of the intramural teams. So, at my
first Pioneer football practice I was under
the impression that my team had just as
much of a chance of winning the upcoming
game as the team that would be lining up
across from us. I was terribly mistaken;
not only did we lose the game, but we
would go on to lose 29 of 34 more games

thinking will ever change. Since I have
been a participant in Grinnell athletics,
the responsibilities of the coach to run the
team have been ever»increasing. With this
being the case, I do not think that the
players will take responsibility for
anything they do anymore, So, my ques
tion is: when did the coach get the respon-
sibility of being on the ﬁeld for his
players? He should only be responsible for
providing leadership from the sidelines.

I say this because everything that was

Last Sunday, Smith and Haines Halls
battled it out on Rosenbloom Field for the
1932 I.M. football championship. Approx—
imately ten spectators were in the stands
for the game, including Jim Bickal, an-
nouncing the game for KDIC in the press
box. Smith emerged from the regular
season undefeated including a m defeat
of Haines earlier in the season, but Haines
reportedly did not appear in full strength
for that game.

“I see this game basically as a Classic
Northsouth confrontation,” said Ralph
Staples, a semi-finalist from Younkers
which was eliminated in the last game by
Smith, 14—7. “Both teams are going to be
playing on a wider field, giving them a lot
more room to work."

Haines received the ball first. Early in
this series, Haines quarterback Peter
Hautzinger suffered a cut on the inside of
his mouth. Spitting blood, he walked off the
field on his own strengﬂl. Hautzinger
returned later in the half. Brad Vander
Linden, filling in as quarterback. ran on a
keeper for the next two plays with little
success', and consequently Haines had to
punt. '

0n the following play Smith ran the

“sleeper," a special play that Younkers
first_used earlier in the season. Smith went

the bad things, shouldn’t he also be the one

into formation with one less man. Harley
Liker stood near the sidelines. Catching
Haines off guard, Liker ran down the field
and caught a pass from Smith QB. Bob
Gates for a touchdownA two point conver-
sion attempt failed.

Bickal was a little disgusted with the
Haines team. “It shouldn’t have happened.
You just don't get burned like that. This is
big time I.M. football. Maybe Haines will
bounce back. I just don’t know."

On Smith’s first possasion in the second
half, they pulled the “sleeper” again.
Liker, pulling the bluff beautifully, was
wide open and ran the ball for the second of
his three touchdowns for the day. With
Gates’ pass to Felix Tweraser for the two
point conversion, the score was 1+0.

Haines again failed to gain any signifi-
cant yardage on their next drive. The ball
went to Smith on downs.

Gates, not only the most prolific passer
but also the most effective rusher, ran the
ball for 25 yards on the next play, putting
Smith into scoring position. On a pass from
Gates to Kupferberg, Smith Scored again,
making it 22-0.

Halnes was further crippled by someone
burning leaves nearby. A blanket of smoke
covered the field and visibility was reduc-

' ed.

Haines again gave up the ball on downs
to Smith. Liker, split approximately 40
yards left, again was open. He caught the
ball on a flea flicker from Gates for a
touchdown. Smith held the lead and won
the game zoo.

I.M. coordiantor Bickal attributes part
of Haines’ problem to its Zane defense.
”Haines just got stuck with zone defense.
I've always maintained you don’t use zone
in I.M. football. You always use man-tor
man."

Bob Gates was voted by this reporter
and the KDIC crew as the outstanding
player of the‘game. He rushed for 29 yards
and passed (or 160 yards, as compared
with Haines' total offense of 36 yards.

As Harley Liker sums it up. “Our offenSlve
ingenuity was key during the champion-
ship game, but our strong defense is what
really carried us through the season."
