GrinneIl College, whose
1950‘s workrabroad program is
said to have been the model for
John E Kennedy ’sPeace Corps,

Peace Corps this fall, college
president George Drake an-
nounced at a Scholars’ Convo-
cation yesterday morning in
Herrick Chapel.

Under the program, which is
still under negotiation. Grinnell
students would be recruited by
the Peace Corps early in their
college careers 7 during their
sophomore years 7 and would
be put on a course of study
designed to produce the ideal
Peace Corps volunteer by the
time of graduation.

The course of study would in-

tween the students’ junior and
senior year. In their senior year,
the students would participate
together in a senior seminar
which would be the capstone of
their pro-Peace Corps training.

Drake said that if talks with
the Peace Corps go well, the
program wouldbegin this spring
with selected sophomores tak-
ing their ﬁrstclasses in prepara-
tion for entering the Corps.

“From our perspective, it‘s a
question of making it easier for
Grinnell students to qualify for
the Peace Corps, and hence in-

Grinnell’s Travel-Service

forPres.JohnF.Kennedy‘sPeace

Election Nomination Papers

By Brendan Shepherd

Dave McConnell. Dining Serv-
ices director and former mayor of
Grinnell, took out municipal elec-
tion nomination papers recently, but
said he’s not the one running for
ofﬁce.

Accordingto McConnell,his wife
Maxine McConnell will be seeking
the First Ward seat on the city coun-
cil in the Nov. 7 election.

McConnell, who was mayor from
1984 to 1985. held the First Ward
post in 1982 and 1983 but said he is
too busy working on his doctorate to
think of politics.

“I don’t have the time,” he said.

In past elections, McConnell has
taken out nomination papers but
never filed them. He said he does it
to develop interest in the elections.

“I’ve taken out papers every elec-

local political interest,” McConnell
said.

Debra Neff, deputy city treasurer,
said anyone can take out nomination
papers without obligation. The pa-

for declaration of candidacy and
proof of residence, and a nomination
petition for electors‘ signitures.

to a 1988 survey whose results were
released this summon

Thesurvey, taken in April 1988 by
a sociology class, found that while
nine outof ten Grinnell faculty mem-
bers say they strongly Support equal
rights for women, only 84 percent of
female students and 66 percent of
male students say the same.

And while 93 percent of female
faculty members say they are femi-
nists, only 51 percent of male faculty
members say the same. The student
numbersare even lower, with 61 per»
centof women and only 32 percentof
men saying they are feminists.

The survey, done in April, 1988,
by Kent McClelland’s Sociology 341
class. “Methods of Empirical Inves-
Ligation,"foundthatwomenaremore
likely than men to see sexism as a
problem at Grinnell, and are more
likely to call themselves feminists
and condemn discrimination against
lesbians and gays.

The survey also found that faculty
members are more likely than stu-
dents to take a feminist position —
except when asked about homopho-
bia and sexual harassment, which

students saw as more common than
did faculty.

Male students, meanwhile, “stand
out as the group taking all of these
issuesmostlightly,"McClellandwrote
in his statistical report. They “have
by far the lowestpercentage of agree-
ment with a feminist position.”

The survey’s results were calcu»
lated from the responses of 532 stu—
dents and 105 facultymembers, most
of whom took the survey through the
campus’ VAXcomputer system. The
poll covered a wide range of mpics,
including attitudes on sexism,racism
and homophobia, and feelings about
ethnooentn'sm in Grinnell’s curricu-
lum and about cum'cular changes.
Only the results of the questions on
gender have been released

Some of the poll’s other findings:

- Is sexual harassment common at
Grinnell? Almost half the female stu-
dents and a third of female faculty
said yes. while less than a ﬁfth of
male students and faculty agreed.

' Have you been sexually harassed
at Grinnell? Over half the female stu-
dents say they have been. Three per-
cent of them say they‘ve been sexu-
ally attacked here; another three per»
cent say they’ve been sexume har-
assed by a member of the faculty or
administration.

' What is your sexual preference?
Among students, ninepercentof men
and 13 percent of women say they’re
gay or bisexual.

‘ Are you a liberal? Faculty mem-
bers said yes, with 86 percent of
women and71 percentofmencalling
themselves liberals. Student numbers
wereevenlower, 61 percentof women
and 51 percent of male students said
they were liberals.

 

lege, there’s no question we made
the right decision. This is the build
ing we need, for now and for the
future. And we should build it. pro-
vided we don’t think thatit’s exorbi-
tant,” Drake said.

The building is to be located on
North Campus between Cowles Hall
and the Physical Education Com»
plex and is designed to include a
movie theater. concert hall and quar-
ters for the Grinnell Outdoor Rec—
reation Program.

The $4.1 million building is being
funded mostly by Jack and Lucile
Han-is and by Joseph Rosenfield.
Some income from the college‘s en-
dowment will also be used, Drake
said.
