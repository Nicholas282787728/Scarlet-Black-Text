ENTRANCE smrluuus
Among the many cdum
191115, the question of college entrance
requirements is re v prominent. A
sollltlan will be difﬁcult to find but
nevertheless many at our institutions
of learning are making efforts to 'le-
termine the right and wrong or the
matter.

In the west, colleges and universi-
ties are much less rigid in their ch.
trance requirements than in the east,
Where by means of examinations, an
attempt is nearly always made in Illl‘
rapce to ﬁnd out the unfit. The sy
tenl that Harvard has used for the
[last two years is interesting to note
in that it is a modilicd plaii whereby
igll school students, whose grades

The S. S. Kresge Company nob operates 270

him to serve iii most all departments—stock, ilnor,

The requirements, in addition to ll satisfactory
education, are: An excellent moral character, an

Successlul applicants are placed under the
direction of competent managers, and learn our

resuired before appointment to store management
depends largely upon the ability demonstrated.

We have to other in the beginning: Hard work,
long hours and small living wage. This. a great

graduate; but if he shows an inclination to spend
sutricicut time in training a very bright intiire
awaits him. Managers are paid on a commission

The possibility or holding a good position
