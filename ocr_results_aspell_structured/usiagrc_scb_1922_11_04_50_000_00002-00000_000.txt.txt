' THE BAND '

A hand is an important factor both
in drumming up a. crowd for E» [lap
meeting and in keeping enthusiasm at
a. high pitch during a game. in ac-
COl‘diane with plans made for the
last two pep meetings the members of
the ba'nd were asked to be in front
of the dormitories promptly at six

thirty to lead the crowd of men over
to the quadrangle and from there
march over to A. R. H. for the big
gathering. Upon both of these 00.
casions a few faithful members turn-

Well Worth this little inconvenience to
be able to show off Grinuell to a
group of such representative high
school students.

The ﬁnest program in the history
of the association has been arranged
for the convention, and it is certain
to draw a large crowd here. The
high school students come, not be
cause they want to see Grinneli Cole
ige, but because they expect to get
a great deal or good from the cone
vention. They are certain to get (lie
good from the convention, but it is
up torthe students of Grinocll College
to see that they go away with a good
impression of our Alma Mater.

“We should look past the matonal'

in Chapel Tuesday. “The life, hoop

ness, and success of everyone depends
‘on how we play the game." In quot»

,"education is the process of learning
the rule of this mighty game, by ad—
dlistment of the intellect, laws and
principles of nature."
