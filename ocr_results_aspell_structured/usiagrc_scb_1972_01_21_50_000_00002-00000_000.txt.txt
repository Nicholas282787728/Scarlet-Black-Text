Political Pressure

by Greg Vranicar

One of the most often heard com-
ments during last semester's great
“academic pressure" debate was
that there is nothing else to do at
Grinnell except study. Although
many students who have no trouble
tinding other activities to occupy
their time disagreed, the {requency
with which the assertion was made
leads one to believe that it must
have some validity.

Possibly there has been a failure
to make known to the community
the activities in which students may
engage. In order to inform and
stimulate interest in a non»academic
matter, I would like to discussbrief—
ly an event that will occur in the
coming week.

On Monday, the process to nominate
the Democratic Party’s Presidential
Candidate for the 1972 election Offi-
cially begins here in Grinnell. That
night at 8 PM. all across the state,
members of the Democratic Party
will meet in precinct caucuses to
Vote for delegates committed to the
various Presidential candidates.
The caucuses are particularly im-
portant to students for several rea-
sons.

First, because Iowa is the first
state to hold its precinct caucuses
anywhere in the nation, the results
of the meetings are particularly

. significant as a barometer of things
to come in other states. Iowa is for
the 24 states without primary elec-
tions what New Hampshire is for the
primary statesrrthe first indicator
of the relative strength of the var—
ious candidates. Because of this
fact, there will be very extensive
news coverage of the caucuses. The
major TV, radio, and newspaper
news departments are watching Iowa
very closely. The results are ex-
pected to have a deiinite impact on
the campaign.

Another reason this Monday’s
meetings are significant is that they
are the first nominating process to
be held since 1810 zlyear-olds have
been able to vote. Because of this
change in the constitution, students
have a very strong interest in inilu-
encing who is nominated to run in
November. in a noneprimary state
like Iowa, students will not be able
to participate in the nominating pro-
cess unless they attend the precinct
caucuses. Students will forfeit any
inﬂuence on whose name will appear
on the ballot in November if they do
not attend Monday’s meeting.

Finally, if students acrossthe state
make a significant effort to attend
the caucuses, their inﬂuence will be
very dramatically and forcefully
felt. Normally less than fifteen
people attend each caucus. Since so
new people attend, it is not at all
difficult to “take over” a caucus by
appearing in large numbers and
choosing delegates that represent

student viewpoints and concerns,

Any student who considers himself
a member of the Democratic Party
and intends to vote in Grinnell next
fall can and should attend the caucus.
Students who intend to vote in a state
other than Iowa should not attend,
since legally they are not members
of the Iowa Democratic Party. It
should be stressed, however, that
those who intend to vote by absentee
ballot in their home state in Novems
her can look forward to very strict
and formal absentee-voter regular
tions. on the other hand, Iowa voting
laws make it very easy for Grinnell
College students to vote

Business besides the choice of
delegates will also be conducted at
the caucuses, The most important
other activity will be the election of
new committee men and women for
each of the precincts. These elecs
lions are significant because the
Central Committee controls the
Democratic Party throughout the
year and elects the County Chairman
who is leader ofthe Poweshiek Coun-
ty Party. Again, it students make
their Voices heard, they can have
influence on these selections.

Students who are interested in get-
ting away from their books for an
hour or so to participate in a pro
ject in which they can help nominate
one of this year's Presidential cans
didates should come to the meeting
scheduled for 7:30 pm. on Sunday
evening in the South Lounge of the
Forum. A more detailed explanation
of the caucuses will be made and
questions will be answered. Bring a
friend to the meeting, too!!

 

 

The Doppelt Effect

by Jack Doppelt

The "Ride Board“ displayed in the
post office will face its first relaxed
test this semester. It was instituted
the week before finals. The trans-
porlnlion aid then tried to accommo-
date the droves of students fleeing
Grinnell

lts iunction during the more trans
qllil portions of the semester is dire
ferent than during the vacation exor
dus Instead of merely providing
students with rides home, it will
actually determine where some Stu-
dents will spend their weekends.
If a ride is offered to Colorado,
some of us will make it a point to
join in the expedition just to catch
a breather from the Grinnell routine.
Some of us do not return, but then
the mountains ofGrinnell aren’t very
enticing.

Ride cooperation has innumerable
advantages for both parties. it is

ecologically sound to reduce indie
vldual excursions, economically
worthwhile to split expenses, exper
ditious to divide the driving> SOCl‘
ally stimulating (where else canyou
get such a captive audience), and
mainly it breeds abrotherhood sore-
ly lacking here

The “Ride Board" was constructed
by Lenore Miller with funds from the
Student Coordinator’s Office. It cons
sists of a multi-colorcd map of the
United States and blue (seeking
rides) and yellow (offering rides)
cards for the names of those in-
terested.

Ride boards of all types have been
experimented with before with dis
appointing results KDlC even con-
sidered broadcasting l‘lde informa-
tion. it is nothing new but then nei-
ther is the frustration ofdiscoverlng
that someone has just returned from

it's once again award time, and we
will look at the Worst in Rock, 1971.
Everyone knows what the best was,
so why write aboutthat anyway? The
worst is so much more interesting.
So:

Worst male vocalist is a lie between
Sonny Hono, who sounds like an elecr
tric mixer, and Donny Osmond, who
is too inane to even talk about. The
Beatles (gasp!) take awards for
worst female vocalists, as there is
another tie; this one between Linda
McCartney and Yoko Ono.

Who else but Grand Funk Railroad
could get the worst group award?
How so many people could go hairy
over three sweating, gyrating non—
talehts is beyond me. Phew! The
worst album goes to steven Stills’
first effort. and in second place,
his second album. (And let’s not
iorget Great Blind Degree, Richie
Havens.)

The worst new group or 1971 was
wings, Paul McCartney'snewgroup,
Paul's apples now come directly
from the bottom of the barrel

There were so many bad songs of
”71 that it’s hard to Choose one. I’ll
just name some notables: “Knock
Three Times,” “Chirpy»Chirpy
Cheep»Cheep", anything by the es,
monds, Bobby Sherman, and such
trash, and Sly’s “It's a Family
Affair," I think Sly has forgotten
what music is,

The worst songwriter award goes
to Bernie Taupin, for his meaning—
less, phony lyrics. I've seen better
poetry irom a computer. I don't
think even he knows what he's tall-t-
ing about. The Moody Blues come
close here They have gotten pro-
gressively worse ever since they

started.

There are many other “worsts”
l’m sure you could think of If you
feel so inclined, let hie know. it
is good to note, however, that gen-
erally, rock has improved in 1971
from the deadly year 1970, Thereare
so many ”forms” that it’s impos
sible to really. say where rock is
headed. There's more jazz, more
basic rock, and it’s still not as
loud and driving as the late 60’s.
Stars ranged from Rod Stewart to
Carole King to Carly Simon to
Keith Emerson to Eric Clapton (still)
to Duane Allnian (another rock cas-
ualty) to the Who to Cat Stevens and
to others. There was no one kind of
rock which dominated 1971. lleel
that this Will be the same situation
in 1972.

the place you couldn’t get to

The board is a centralized effort
to organize cooperation,

“It is one spot to keep in communis
cation with each other. Before,
notices were all over God's crea-
tion,” said Bob Meyer, student co,
ordinator

It could be more effective with the
participation of the faculty A seg-
ment indicating those who know of
available rides coming to Grinnell
might also be beneficial.

As Horace Greeley once said to
.l. B. Grinnell, “Go West, young
man and take someone with you.”
