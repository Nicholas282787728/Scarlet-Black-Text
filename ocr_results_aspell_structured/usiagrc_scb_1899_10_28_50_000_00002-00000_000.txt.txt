Tnls EVENING at the Congregation
al church the students have the chance
to take advantage of one of the rarest
opportunities which college lite ol'l'ersr
Mr. Wln. Dean Howells, who lectures
is witllolrt dollbt at the head at Amer
ican contemporaneous ﬁction writers.
In addition to the fact that his works
have always been of the highest lit-
erary merit he has been a very volue
minous writer and the name of his
novels are almost household words
throughout the land Among his
best known works are "Daisy Miller",
“Tales of Three Cities,” “Rise of Si-
las Lapham,” “Their Wedding Jourr
ney" and a “Modern Instance." Mr
Howell is a decided realist and this
fact is shown prominently ill all of
his works. We feel tllat the college
is under great obligations to Mr.
Howell for his kindness in giving Its
this date, as it was only through his
kindly interest ill Grinnell that we
have been able to secure him; tor to
pay the prices he usually receives for
his lectures would be ollt ot the ques-
tion. Tire subject of Mr. Howell’s
lecture is “Heroes and Heroines of
Fiction." Let none fail to take ad-
vantage of this opportunity, as the
chance to heal and come ill contact
with a man of such merit and stands
ing is exceedingly rare.

SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to call
attention to a letter received tlom the
headquarters of the “Colonial Dames
of America,” at Davenport, Iowa, in
regard to a prize recently otlered by
them for an historical essay. ill or-
der that this lnay be thoroughly un-

derstood we print the letter.

“Hi
Freshman Party.

The ghosts of the class of l90}
assembled for a short time, yesterday
evening, ill the Institute hall. Tile
electric lights were turned oil, and the
room was llghted by the jack-ollallr
terns, which had been brought by the
ghosts and placed in ditlerellt parts at
the hall. As a part of the enteltain~
ment, booths had been arranged at
which the ghosts could have their
fortunes told. When all had arrived
partners were chosen Ior tlle“5\vlalld
march,” after which they unmasked.

The saying, ”Your voice will be-
tray you,” was well illustrated last
night, for nearly all the ghostsdhough
they may have tried ever so hard,
could not disguise their voices. After
they had unmasked the guests were
invited to help themselves to gum,
which was placed upon one of the
tables. Light refreshments, which
consisted of apples, were also served
The faculty were represented by ML
Heidel and Mr. Davis
