Special interest basketball
The biggest show
under the dome

by Robert Quoahie

Once again sports fans and
fanatics, it’s time for another ear
citing round ot Special Interest
Basketball; time to turn our atten-
tion from another dull season of
NCAA roundball to the big boys
here in Grinnell.

This ain't the Big Ten — it's the
real stuff!

And stuff is what you can expect
from teams such as the Fecal
Peole and Burning Rectal Itch
(we say this tongue in cheek).

The cage will tip off this Tuér
day, January 31, under the lights
of the P,E.C., one of the finest
facilities of its kind on the face of
this grand earth. Sorry, but due to
the large number of ticket re
quests no seats will be reserved.

For the lowdown on the match
ups we called our bookies in
Vegas, but aiter the Orange, Cot-
ton, Rose and Super Bowls, none
were available for comment.

So, here is our attempt afa pre-
season forecast. Read on and
place your hetsl

prove to be a surprise [or a few of
their opponents. Also, watch'out
for the smooth moves and hard
slamming power at Mike (XNeilM‘
pre-season spotters have com-l

pared this kid to a young Clyde ,

‘The Glide’ Drexler.

Coming in fourth will be TheSea
Men, Come. come boys, what a
name, This team, comprised for
the most part of iootball players
may have lound its true calling.

Led by Rick Jaacks, a cinch for
MVP, and fifth season red-shirt
Tom Hanseter, this team will be
good but not good enough, though
they claim to have a surprise lor
us called “The Gupp',

with adequate preparation,
MVP candidate Brad Vander
Linden, and the Fecal People
should make a good run, but our
scouts report that this team
passes a load too much and runs
out of gas in the second half. The
Fecal People will not make a big
splash: riith place.

 

 

And stuff is what you can
expect from teams such as
the Fecal People and
Burning Rectal Itch

 

The preseason pick for the
number one ranking is last year's
second place finisher, The Nads,
Led by Doug Sauerwein (a sinch
ioi- MVPl and Mike Lynch. The
Nads havetwo of the key elements
for success; height and ex-
perience, Go Nads, Go!

To finish in the top position The
Nads will have to overcome stiff
competition from The Chucks, a
team comprised mainly oiiormer
J.V. Pioneers. Watch out for Ken
Coyle and John Ostrander. two
cinches for MVP.

The Chucks will finish second
over .liahn Chen-Yu and His
Cloistered Contemplatives. This
team could be the sleeper oi the
year, a la '52-'83 N.C. State, were
taking a chance on this one,
Strong play from Steve Worth, Ara
nie Bryson and Chad Larsen could

Burning Rectal itch should bea
pain in the rear to no one. These
boys play B-ball with the grace
and linesse of the Super
Destroyer Jack ‘Tatum' Hartung
may be up for MVP but, ltch’s
nitch is sixth.

Under the Rectal Itch and in
seventh place we will find The
Pub Rats. Among other things the
Rats will be playing under the in
iluence ol captain and possible
MVP Pete Schumacher. But the
His have one problem and
"Playboy" magazine said it best:
“too much thinking and not
enough drinking."

Last and least, we iind the 1984
Grinnell Pioneers after playing
such consistent ball on the road,
Gar thinks his men are ready for
some real competition.

We don’t agree; dead last.

Women continue road tests

Women‘s Basketball

Three games await the Grinnell
College women's basketball team
during a iouruay period as the
Pioneers continue a long string of
mid-season mad encounters,

Coach Cathie Schweitzer will
take her Grinnellians to Wheaten,

bowing at the University of
Chicago, 67-29, at Beloit, 70734,

,and at Clarke, 68-55.

Schweitzer called Chicago and
Beloit “two of the best defensive
teams we will play this year" and
noted that her Pioneers shot only
23 percent lrom the ﬁeld at
Chicago and 22 percent at Beloit

“Our shot selection was poor
and we allowed the opposition iar
too many many ofenslve rer

Swimmers expect another

top season

by Robert Qnuahie

About this time at year, the
warm sun and sandy beaches of
Florida would do anyone good, in
cluding the Men's and Women‘s
Pioneer swim teams, who trained
there over break.

Both Coaches Rowedder and
Obermiller have nothing but
positive reports about their
teams’ progress and bids lor suc-
cess in this coming season.

The women have been resting
but not idle since December 12,
when they posted a comeafrom-
behind Victory over Luther Col-
lege, 78-62 Respective first and
second place finishes by Debbie
Coles and Carolyn Carpenter in
the 1-meter optional diving, the
ireestyle ioursome oi Philpott,
Constant, Petheram, and
Wibiralske, who out-paced the
field by more than two and a half
seconds. and Sheryl Thedford's
50-yard breaststroke, highlighted
the meet.

Thedford set a Grinnell record
with a time of 32.36, Our 2007de
medley unit of Mineah, Thedford,
Lewis, and Petheram also set a
new standard with a time of
2:03.21.

Coach Rowedder feels that the
team looks very fast and should do
well in the coming months. The
women will be here Saturday to
face the University of Chicago
Maroons.

The men will also be in the pool
to lace the Maroons, In pre
Christmas action the men won a
dual with Missouri-St. Louis and
took second to Luther at a
quadrangular meet. Then it was
all to West Palm Beach, Fla.

Upon returning to Grin City,
The pioneers proceeded to sink
Rockiord in a dual 65-23. They
placed second in our own Grinnell
Relays, finishing behind only
Luther. Coach Obermiller com
ments that the team is at the best
that he has ever seen It at this
time of year. They look good for
the conference championships,
which will be held March iirst, se-
cond and third,

We could run down the names
from Block to Rollins, but in my
eyes the Pioneers all look tan,
tough and ready for Chicago.

Early schedule unkind to phoopsters

by Robert Qusshie

Bombs Away! Coach Gar Smith
may have thought he left this cry
back,wlth the Air Force, but it
must have been ringing in his eats
and those oi his players as they
dropped seven games in twelve
days.

In Indiana for the first time
since 1933, Grinnell lost non-
conference tilts to St. Francis Col»
lege, Taylor University, Bethe]
College and Mt. St. Clare. the only
team they have beaten in regular
season play.

The conference was not any
more kind to the Pioneers, Grin-
nell bowed at Coe, 65759; at Lake
Forest, 97-76; and at the Universi-
ty of Chicago, 3257.

Coach Smith lelt that travel
delays and general iatigue may
have eliected the play ol the
Pioneers “The travel had a lotto
do with our inability to sustain our
level of intensity We played thirty
minutes oi solid hall at Chicago
but we laded in the second half.”

Well, we hope the Pioneers got a
good night's sleep, for tonight at
7:30 they face the high-powered
offense of St, Norbert Rated fif-
teenth in the NCAA division Ill,
second in the conference in both
team offense and defense, St.
Norbert should bring all that Dar-
by Gym can handle, but don't
count the Pioneers out.,

 

The Pioneers, who sometimes seem to be all nblur, lire picked to
finish last in our Special lmcresl‘baaketball poll. Pholo by Mike

Williams. ‘. x - .

Jim Niemeyer is currently first
in the conference in rebounds.
Steve Galster is seventh. And here
we find the key to a Grinnell vic-
tory, The Pioneers are racking up
the points but they are currently
ranked last in the conference in
team defense

When the ball goes up it mist
come down, in the hands of a
Pioneer,

The Pioneers will save a bit for
Saturday, when they lace Nor-
thern Div ion foe, Lawrence, at3
p.m., also in Darby Gymnasium.
Lawrence is 1-4 in the conference
but 7-5 overall. However,
Lawrence is not the caliber of St,
Norbert,

If tonight‘s game does not turn
into a shoot-out and the Pioneeis
continue to do what they do well —
rebound 7 this should prove to be
a good weekend ior basketball.
