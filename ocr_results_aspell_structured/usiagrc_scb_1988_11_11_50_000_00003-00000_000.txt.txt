The Night of Broken Glass

by Matt Macho

This week marks the fifti-
eth anniversary of the Kristal—
naeht (crystal night). Half a cen—
tury ago last Wednesday night,
Nazi persecution of Jews was
brought to a new level of brutalr
ity, and the rest of the world
watched it happen.

When the Nazis ﬁrst came
to power, Jews were thrown out
of the civil service, and through—
out the 1930's Jewish profes-
sional activity was restricted. In
1936 (the year the rest of the
world played Olympic Games in
Munich) Jews were no longer
considered German citizens, and
any intermarriage between Jews
and Gentiles was proclaimed ille~
gal. Jews were threatened and
often beaten by Nazi gangs, and
encouraged to cmmigrate from
Germany,

But it was fifty years ago
that the holocaust began on
Kristallnacht, or the night of

broken glass. On this night,
gangs of Nazi storm troopers ar-
rested thousands of Jews,
subjecting many to torture and
beating several to death outright.
Synagogues were burned, Jewish
shops were looted and destroyed.
The German police were ordered
not to interfere in this orgy of
destruction unless noneiewish
property was threatened by the
Nazi thugs. By the next morn-
ing, most Jewish-owned busi-
nesses, which had once been
among the most prosperous in
Germany, lay among smoldering
shards of broken glass. There
was not a single Synagogue left
standing in Germany.

Most of the Jews arrested
by the SS were threatened and
beaten, then released and told to
get out of Germany. While the
official death toll of the Reichs'
Kristallrtachl only numbered in
the dozens, thousands of Jews

committed suicide upon seeing
their lives shattered by the Nazi
boot. More importantly. the
night of broken glass was a
harbinger of forthcoming global
disaster, a thousand voices
screaming, nails screeching
across the blackboard of nearly
universal indifference.

While hundreds of thou»
sands of Jews emmigrated, others
were not so fortunate. Most of
those who stayed behind joined
the millions of Poles, Russians,
homosexuals, and Gypsies gassed
and burned in Nazi death camps
as the world watched.

Remember the lives that
were shattered on that night of
broken glass, and remember also
that it was ignorance as well as
hatred, indifference as well as
bigotry. and apathy as well as
anti-semitism, that made it and
the events it hearkencd possible.

CSC sponsors literacy awareness
and other volunteer programs

by John Newmark

The Community Service
Center, newly formed here on
campus, has named November
"Literacy Awareness Month" for
Grinnell College. The activities
planned for the month are an ex-
tension of the new Adult Literacy
Program established in the com-
munity.

The members of the Literr
acy Program have found that they
have had to start the program al-
most completely from scratch.
According to Maja Hrbek, a stu-
dent coordinator of Literacy
Awareness Month and an active
participant in the Literacy Pror
yam, before this year the closest
literacy program was in
Marshalltown. This was very
inconvenient for Poweshiek
County residents who needed tor
toting. There was nothing in
this county to build upon, but
enough people thought that
something should be created, so

the Literacy Program has begun
to "roll."

People from the Marshall-
town program have come to give
tutoring lessons to interested
volunteers. 'Approximately 30
people from the college and the
community attended the first
uaining session. The federal
Labauch Program, which will be
used to tutor the adults. was ex»
plained. And while the responsi-
bilily of actually teaching adults
such a basic skill as reading
might seem a lot for a person to
handle, the literacy program has
not had that much difficulty at-
tracting interested tutors. People
like Hrbek have gladly volun~
looted their time and energy,

When asked why she vol-
unteered, Hrbck replied that her
interest in Literacy Tutoring be~
gan before she came to Grinnell.
In the Omaha Literacy COUnCll
she tutored a 30 year-old Amerir

 

 

can lndian. And while she had
tutored various of her peers in
school, this experience was much
more rewarding for her, since the
person was actually an adult
rather than a fellow student.
When she arrived here at Grinnell
there was no real avenue for her
to continue tutoring, so she was
natural.y happy to see the Com-
munity Service Center created.
and through that the Literacy
Program.

There are a wide range of
activities planned for Literacy
Awareness Month. One such ac-
livity is a book drive. Donated
books will be used by the volun-
teers in tutoring the adult readers.
Collection boxes will be located
in the Forum, the Post Office,
Cowles, and Quad dining halls.
Popular fiction, short stories,
magazines, and children's books
(for the adults to use with their
children) are all wclcome.

In addition, on Nov. 21,
4zl5 pm. in South Lounge, Dr.
John Prihoda, President of Iowa
Valley Community College Dis-
trict and his wife Mrs. E. Kay
Prihoda, president of Growth
Systems, will speak on

”(ll)literztte America", offering
national and international per-
spectivcs on literacy. There will
also be a student panel on
"Literacy Programs in the US."

have made the same decision, since it likely would have

been overturned on appeal.

well as a film on illiteracy.

Another organization sup
ported by the Community Scr-
vicc Center is Second Milo,
which was founded in 1986.
Second Mile is located in the
basement of the Veterans Memo-
rial Building here in Grinnell, and
is described as "a community
service organization dedicated to
the idea of provid g volunteers
to work on projc . ith anti for
low-income persons and also
people in crisis situations." See
and Milo is not federally funded,
and receives monetary support
from local churches, the United
Way, and CROP.

Onc annual activity is the
Christmas Sharing project which
is organized by two volunteers
who try to make the holiday
more enjoyable for low-income
families. They have also started
a new project entitled "Friends in
Need." They will provide help for
people who find themselves in a
crisis situation and due to unr
usual circumstances need the
additional help, There are count-
less other projects including a
Clothing closet, a loom project,
and a gardening project which all
need volunteers.

Other programs sponsored
by the Center include Jasper
