Kevin MacDonald's “Kitchen Still
Life" and william Dunlap's “son

”Kitchen Still Life" by Kevin MacDonald.

characters are remarkably oppos-
ed, as a result of differences in
technique and color. Kevin Mac-
Donald '5 drawing is reminiscent at
the still lii'es of William Bailey, but
with even less surface interest.
The surlace is utterly spare. c0m~

"Spring storm - Valley Series" by William Dunlap.

Part II

Donald is a remembered scene.
The Dunlap is a mix at real places,
rearranged to suit the artist. These
works reﬂect states oi being and
evoke certain emotions in the
viewer They are mental land-
scapes 7 familiar to us, but
somehow strange because we rare»
ly lace our perceptions oi the world
and pare down our memories,
deline them on paper, as have
these artists.

in looking at the MacDonald, I
am reminded oi the iirst stanza oi
Anne Sexton's poem "Welcome
Morning":

There is joy

in all:
in the hair 1 brush each morning.
in the Cannon towel. newly
wash ed.
that l rub my body with each
morning.
in the chapel or eggs I cook
each morning,
in the outcry train the kettle
that heats my coiiee
each morning.
in the spoon and the chair
that cry ”hello there, Anne”
each morning.
in the godhead oi the table
that i set my silver, plate, cup upon
each morning.
