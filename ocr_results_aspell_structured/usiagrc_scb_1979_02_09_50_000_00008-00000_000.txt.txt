Lloyd Durr is a iarmer who
makes his living by supplying the

Durr keeps a llock oi exotic

DRIVING WEST DOWN US.
Highway 6, Durr’s tarm stands out
rrom all too familiar countryside.
The complacent driver's eyes may
be arrested by the sight of a
wandering herd of buffalo or a
trolting emu. *

Durr gets s animals from all
over and sells them to buyers
around the world. He says he gets
between 30 and 50 calls a week.
When asked how all these people
hear or him, Durr replied, “they

just know me.!’ He has a constant
turnover of animals, and has had
everything from tions to pygmy
goats on hand at one time or
another

WALKING ONTO THE Durr
farm one gets the feeling of being
watched by the animals They
notice you. His lriendly dog greets
you at the gate and guides you
around.

This time ofyear the animals are
in a few large pens. All the
animal’s eyes are on you as you

survey camels, and emu,
miniature mountain goats, a long
black haired llama, and a couple
of zonles, To your right a family of
albino reindeer stand at Mr
tentionito your left a lew large
deer. Roosters crow, baby pigs
squeal, and a peacock takes oil, its
wide wings lilting bright colors to
the barn top

ONE OF DURR'S most unique
possesions is a waist high beast
called the zonyiyou guessed it, a
cross between a zebra and pony.
Zonies may have stripes or spots
and are built like diminuitive
Zebrast But their most distinctive
characteristic is their tem-
perment. I iound the zonies to be in
a gentle mood, but Durr says they
occasionally express a foul

disposition, biting and kicking.

Durr started cross breeding
horses a. zebras because, as he
Put it, “ S something different." i
There’s been a lot of people who
tried it and never got it done," But
Durr hasn’t had much luck selling
his unioue contribution to the Wild
kingdom. Rodeos won't buy them,
for example, because they‘re not
enough like horses. All together,
Durr has only sold about ten zonies
Since he successfully crossbred
them,

DURR WOULD HAVE one think
that he breeds his animals as a
purely financial endeavor. He
casually speaks ofhls ‘stuft’ as any
businessman would refer to his
merchandise, But after a short
talk, Durr betrays something more
than mere financial interest in his
flock.

He maintains his menagerie at
considerable trouble and expense,
Exotic animals such as camels,
emus, and zonies, although they
adapt to the Iowa Wlnters, Still
require particular ‘care and
feeding, And just getting them to
Iowa entails wading through many

endangered species. But high
prices have hurt his efforts in this
area.

Despite these troubles, Durr has
been at it for 15 years'and talking-

to him one gets the impression
he‘d never think or stopping.
Running a local we would seem to
have its benefits. ‘
EVERY YEAR between ‘
1,500 and 2,000 grade school
children visit Durr‘s farm to feed
the camels and pet the zonies. i-le

encourages anyone to visit his
farm, and that includes college
students, In this sense Durr is
gladly rultilling a much needed
public service. Although there are
lots of animals out in the country
there aren’t many exotic ones, and
the nearest otfical zoo is in Des
Moines.

Moreover. Durr’s un-
conventional 200 offers a rare
interaction with the animals.
There are no separate caga or
labels to separate the animals.

and bark at them causing a quick
retreat. As the animals move back
to safety, the humans move on to
another pen.

DURR SELLS HIS animals
mostly to other collectors and zoos.
Overall he says business isn‘t bad,
and prices are high. An emu would
cost you about 3250. And for the
pelson in your life who has
everything—a camel would put you
out between 2,000 to 3,000 bucks”

But that didn't stop a Las Vegas

And for the person in your life who

has everything—a camel would put

you out between 2000
and 3000 bucks.

When one stands in front of a pen
full of such diverse creatures, with
all of them staring back just as
intently as the visitor looks on, one
gets a reeling for the variety of life.
The animals—truly curiousi
gather around the observer,

crooning and crowing tor a
glimpse of the humans. Then, all ot
a sudden, Durr's dog may run up

magician from buying a baby
camelnottoo long ago. He used the
camel for a levitiation act on TV.
Although Durr didn’t see the show,
one gets the impression that it
wouldn’t have shocked him too
much to see one of his animals
ﬂoating around on the lube. Alter
all, for Lloyd Durr, the out of the
ordinary is the just ordinary,
