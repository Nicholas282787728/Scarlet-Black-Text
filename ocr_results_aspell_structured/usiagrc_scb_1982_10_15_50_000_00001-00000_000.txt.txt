No missiles, no bombs, no war

West Germany's peace movement

many, where this topic is very much alive, I
though! I would offer my perceptions in regard
to this debate.

Last June and November, citizens u! the
Federal Republic oi Germany gathered in
Bonn to protest the escalating nuclear
arms race. This fever quickly spread to
England, France, the Netherlands and
many other countries. Some say that it
was these movements which crossed the
seas to inspire the growth iii the American
“Freeze" movement.

The two demonstrations in Bonn drew
between 300,000 and 500,000 demonstrators
each, making them the two largest

~ demonstrations in Germany's postwar
history.

The German “Friedenbewegung”
tpeace movement) cannot be characterize
ed only as a movement stemming from
young radical groups voicing discontent,
such as the many early Viet Nam protests
did. There ls definitely a greater Interest
in participatiion by the younger student
groups. in Frieburg, where l studied, one
of the hotter items debated in the student
government elections was the proposed
construction oi a nuclear power plant in
southwest Germany.

However, marching along side the many
students 3 parents, proiessionals,
teachers. poli cians, elderly people and
members oi religious organizations. Slmpr
ly stated, it is a crosssectlon 0|" German
society.

One reason why the Germans have been
so concerned about and sensitive to a great
deal oi East»West political policy is the
significant gen-political factor looming in
the background. Whether a nuclear war is
created by a western nation or an eastern
nation, the Federal Republic is still caught
in the crossfire. Unlike the U.S,, with an
ocean as a natural boundary, or unlike the
Soviet Union with satellite nations acting
as a buffer zone, me Germans have
nothing to hide behind.

Lately, even the strong ties to western
alliances have been questioned by many
Germans. When our government loosely
throws out vague notions of “limited war,”
or when the postal service develops plans
to carry on deliveries after an attack,
many people are leit wondering about the
rationale of some decision makers. Der
Spiegel, West Germany's counterpart to
Time and Newsweek, ran an article
several months ago concerning a civil
defense pamphlet circulating through the
Eastern Bloc which showed the proper sur-
vival techniques in case oi war. In it, one

“Stand for peace." Many such posters greeted President Reagan on his trip to

Bonn, Germany, last June.

oi the Falkland war, I remember reading
a poll by Le Moude, a French newspaper,

asking the citizens in all the Western Euro?

pean nations whether or not they would
resort to actions such as England's
Falkland invasion ii their own country was
involved Almost 70 percent in each nation
answered “yes" except Germany. Only
about 28 percent would have iollowed
England’s course or action. Aiter the hor-
rors oi World War ii. the Allies sought to
create a passive German state. Now they
have one, ironically, the majority oi those
taking to the street were born many years
alter the war. -

The decision oi NATO to increase thc
supply oi missles on German soil in 1983
has caused much Irictioll and stirred emo-
tions. Many Germans are reluctant lo
stand behind rhctoric or action that points
the Soviet Union as the world's greatest

 

threat to peace and/or stability. :i.
terestlng as it may sound, many oi the
German students i talked to simply did not
see the Soviets as trying to put the squeeze
on Western Europe As one woman put it.
“They (Soviets) are Europeans too." The
strong public opinion at the time I was
there advocated better relations with the
East in the hopes oi easing tensions.

Opposition to the nuclear arms race is
not only rooted in‘ political matters butalso

_in anxieties expressed by environmental

and religious organizations.

It seemed that just about anywhere one
looked, the slogan. “Frieden schaiien ohne
Walien" (create peace without arms)
could be seen on posters. banners and
bumper stickers The church is naturally
concerned with the escalating arms race
rcsulting in the ruin oi mankind Even in
the “other" Germany. the German
Democratic Republic. the rise oi the

church as an advocate of peace was put-
ting the government in a difficult position.
Many groups in East Germany are trying
to reduce the obligatory duty in the armed
iorces. In the West, many a student 1 met
sidestepped his military service by work
ing in some sort oi civil or social capacity,

The relationship between church and
state is perhaps not as strong in Germany
as it is in the states. Because it does not
have a substantial political lobby, the
church must strive extra hard to get its
message across.

For a long time this was also the case
with the many environmental groups in
Germany. Alter the war and the ensuing
decades, West Germany turned heavily to
its industry to bring the country back to its
position as a major power. Subsequently,
the environmentalists were struggling in
the background. Much oi this may change
with the current rise oi a new political
power known as the “Greens." This party
is still struggling to develop into a cohe 've
political iorce and still is not in a position
to call the shots, Their quick rise, though,
does have such traditional parties as the-
Social Democrats and Christian
Democrats keeping a wary eye on them

Many oi the students who did vote [or the
“Greens" were not so much convinced
that the “Greens" had all the answers. but
by casting a vote with this alternative
group, perhaps they ielt the other parties
in power would get the message This idea
itseli was. ior many students, a way oi
demonstrating against the current policy
makers.

The campaign against nuclear arms is
only one oi the many areas pursued by the
“Greens.” lvluch oi their time is also taken
up with eiiorts to prevent the construction
oi a new airport runway in Frankiurt and
with cleanup projects in the heavy in-
dustrial district along the Rhine.

One oi the surprising elements 'in the
demonstrations held in Bonn was the lack
oi violence. There were no mass riots or
conirontations with the police. in
November, Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr.
joined i-iarry Belaionte and an assortment
oi sympathetic politicians to speak and
Sing.

when President Reagan made his trip in
June oi this year, the only violence that
broke out was in West Berlin as youths oi
all ages turned over cars, smashed
storeiront windows, or threw cobblestones
at the riot policemen.

There was a bit or tragedy. however.
