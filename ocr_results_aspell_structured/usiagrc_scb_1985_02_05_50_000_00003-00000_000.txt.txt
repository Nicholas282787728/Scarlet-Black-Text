Students demonstrate in support of
ollege investments practices

by Michael 0 Neill lit Scott Ililduln

A group or students tavoring Grinnell
College 5 investment in South Alrica
assembeled alongside the Students to End
Apartheid during the trustee meeting
Friday. The pro- Investment group headed
by Russell Matteson and Ian McLean op
poses the divestment views at the SEA
group ttormerly the South Alrlcan Support
Group).

Speaking tor the group against divest-
merit. McLean asked that Grlnnell College
co‘ntinue investing in South Airica in order
to "etlect real change,“

lVchean claimed that divestment is the
wrong approach to solving the problem or
apartheid on two counts The iirst is the
claim that even a total elimination ot inter
national trade with South Airica would not
markedly aliect the country economically.
Intact. McLean stated that such activity
"would only give more incentive to South

Trustees

Africa's regime to increase its oppression
oflts people

McLean s second point in critic in or
divestment addressed what he termed El
“moral double standard” on the part of
divestment supporters. McLean asked
where is the outcry oi protest against the
Soviet murdering oi millions in
Afghanistan. or the Mengitsu regime
which has starved hundreds of thousands
in Ethiopia.

‘Finally Mcbean asked that the U. . use
the economic lever it has established as
Sbuth Africa's largest trading partner

.“Let‘s use this lever in a constructive
way. leading South Alrica to change and
improvement Uur 'lrustees have not gone
rar enough in this area — we urge them to
‘ se Grinnell 5 South Alriedn Stock to begin

a productive movement to change by
working with South Africa to inﬂuence its
policies and not to walk away from the pro-
blem by divesting completely,“

The McLean/Matteson proposal asks
that the trustees invest Grinnell money on-
ly in corporations that adhere to the
Sullivan Accords, The proposal also asks
that "annual reports to the Trustees and to
the Student Government Association on
the progress which such companies have
made in implementing the Accords" be
submitted with the understanding that
Grinnell will divest irom any companies
which fail to abide by the Accords.

Grinnell's new investments do currently
follow the trend outlined by the
McLean/Matteson proposal. Annual
reports are already submitted to the
Trustees. There Is also a standing invita»

balloting by proxy that takes place on an
annual basis.

According to Leslie Hagan. prominent
member of the S A. the McLean/Mats
teson proposal indicates that the pro-
investment group really doesn't underSv
[and the goals of the SEA. The SEA is a
forum lor ideas on how to end apartheid.
“We're not students for divestment.‘ '
Ragan said. "we're students to end apar-
theid. We're working on several dillerent
levels."

To the best at Ragan's knowledge.
neither Matteson nor McLean have ever
been to one at the SEA'S meetings, He also
doesn't recall having seen a member of the
Young Republicans at any oi the meetings.

”it was interesting how similar their
strategy in the second paragraph lot the

proposall was to ours." ltagan said. He
noted that while the philosophy oi
capitalism and democracy may not be
quite the same as that held by members oi
the SEA. Hagan sees the goals as pretty
much the same.

“It indicates a lack of loresight 0n the

members or the lpro-investmentl group .
. that they didn't investigate the issue
more thoroughly." Regan said “The in
formation is easily accessible. The
meetings are every Tuesday night at 8:30
pm."

For it years the SEA under various
names has been working in Grinnell on the
investment question The SEA today is
working on the very issues pointed to in the
McLean/Matteson proposal except to a
more sophisticated degree Ragan said.

The SEA is currently working on a re-
investment proposal with the trustees and
has been working with the Investor
Responsibility Research Center.
