Quadrangle Gossip

The man who saw the girls lined up
on the are escape smoking cigarettes
is giving away the fact that he knows
where to get hold of that which caus—
eth the head to swim, the tongue to
hahble, and the eyes to see many lights.

And cdncel‘nlng'ﬁl'e escapes, don't
they suppose we’ve got anything to do
besides spend our time untastening the
wires that hold them up.

Concerning Leap 'Year Date Night:

“There are about tlventyﬁve tellows
in this building that haven’t dates and
would like theni mighty Well."

“Do you realize that there are a good
many more girls than that at the
Quad every weekend who haven't
dates?” ’

Got any comeback to that?

Dutch treats make a mean”,
but they don’t Work out so well in
practice. .

left the ﬁnal score to be decided by
the Freshmen and Juniors.

Throughout the ﬁrst half, an even
score was maintained till the Fresh
men tipped the scales by edging a. ﬁeld
goal Just before the whistle sounded.
The Freshmen kept in the lead for
the remainder of the game, though the

Each Has Place In
Symphony of Life

That each one of us has a deﬁnite
place in the symphony oi liic which
nobody else can till was the theme of
President Muin's talk at Sunday morn-
'mg prayers at the Quadrangle. We
all help to create our own atmosphere
or mental climate by, every act and
thought no matter liow apparently
trivial. And it the mental atmosphere
oi one is out or tune, by that much is
the harmony oi the lite symphony tier
stroyed. ’

The program was concluded by Miss
l-lai-riet Slater, who sang “Teach me
to Pray".

URGES HARMONY
IN COLLEGE LIFE

President Talks on ”Bouquets
And Brickbats.” '

Pres. J. H. T. Main spoke at chapel
.Tuesday morning on the subject or
“Bouquets and Brickbats." He asked
that during the remainder oi the year
the students live up to the ideals and
purposes at Crinneil so that the then—
sands ot eyes which are watching will
ﬁnd nothing out oi harmony with the
standing ot the institution.

President Main stated the essentials
at an education as given by Matthew
Arnold, "hey are atmosphere, disci-
pline and lire. A man who receives
llicse e ntials while in college re-
ceives lbos things which will make
him a success. Criuuoll alumni, he
said, Attribute their success to the
. it which they received here. He
pointed out that because Gl'lnncll is
conspicuous and distinguished. licoplc
are ready to magnify any discl‘epmlgy
or misdcmoanor reported i-lc tliinks
that cvcry student should llvc so that
nlcn and women with whom lie talks
will know that he knows the value at
spanning one’s college years in Click
llell. It is up to tlic students to give
the institution character. One way
oi helping is by attendance at Chapel

 

land Vespers, fundamental services or
7this college.

By contributing to this
a student will contribute to Lhe devel—
opment of his own inner life.

pective material goes.

The tryouts lor these debates will

day, April 21.
