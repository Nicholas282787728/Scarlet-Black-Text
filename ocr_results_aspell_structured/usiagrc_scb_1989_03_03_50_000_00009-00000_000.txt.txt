Dr. Strangelove a satirical
look at nuclear war

by Brian Strause

Dr. Slmngelove or Haw I
Learned To Stop Worrying and
Love the Bomb represents one in
,, long line of Stanley Kubrick’ 5
anti- war films although it differs
irom such endeavors as Paths Of

[my and Full Metal Jacket in
that it looks at nuclear war
through the lens of black

outedy. When released in 1964,
Dr. Strangelove immediately was
seen as revolutionary, forging the
"round for Kubrick, who has
since been acknowledged as a
modem master of film.

With biting satire, the film
centers around an unprovoked
nuclear attack instigated by a
,aranoid and psychotic USAF

general, played by George C.
Scott. Well, the missiles having
been launched, all there is to do
is wait for the inevitable retalia-
tion. Peter Sellers brings it all
together. humorously playing
three parts: Lhe president of the
United States, the RAF captain,
and the obligatory mad scientist.
Released a few years after the
Cuban missile crisis when people
could still handle a black-and-
white film, Dr. Strangelove
became a document of the times,
attacking the nightmare of the
20m century in perhaps the only
palatable way, through humor.

The Modems: a look at
Parisian life in the '203

I-y Dan Capone
The Modems, a fairly recent
elease (1988), is Alan Rudolph’s
test film. It is the story of
meriean expatriates in 19205
aris. The film is superbly
ilmcd and directed, wonderfully
apturing the look and feel of
aris in the 19203. Black and
vhiu: newsreel footage is used to
give an increased feel for the
place and time of the ﬁlm; at the
grid of each ﬁctional segment. the
picture fades out to black and
White newsrecl footage before the
next colorized, fictional segment
begins. Rudolph also does a
articularly good job with the
rowd scenes, suclt as the
opening, which takes place in a
crowded cafe. The conversations
urround the people, and the
lively richness of the atmosphere
is effectively conveyed.

The good job Rudolph does
with the visual prcscncc of the
tilm, however is lost on a
poorly written sereenplat, which
is tn part his fault (he co- wrote
.0. In the great care he‘s taken
'ecrcaling the setting of the film,
the other elements suffer.

The story primarily concerns
'tself with the agonized love
affair of Keith Carradine, who
plays an American painter who

living, and Linda Fiorentino, his
already-“married" love. John
Lone plays her husband, who
made his fortune in the condom
business. The film also stars
Wally Shawn as allerald-Triburte
columnist, Geraldine Chaplin as
a society debauchcc, and Kevin J.
O'Connor as Ernest
Hemmingway.

Aside from its interest in the
Carradine-Fiorentino coupling,
the film tells a twisty tale of
Parisian life in the 19205, rather
altogether preposterous. For
instance the film unnecessarily
heads off into the realm of art
forgery, and we are supposed to
believe that three celebrated
works by Cczzane, Modigliani,

and Matisse are
Carmdine's copies.

Problems with the screenplay
and some of tlte casting aside,
Tltr Modems provides an
enjoyable and rich recreation of
the period it examines.

SCARLET AND BLACK

by Anthippy Petras

On Wednesday at 9:30 pm.
in South Lounge, the Latin
American Support Group will be
presenting the film Cover—Up,
sponsored by the Performing Ans
Program. This film was created
by the Christie Institute, a group
that has formally accused the
Reagan/Bush regime of having
been involved in covert actions
and breaking international laws.

The film focuses on the Iran-
Contra affair and President
George Bush’s association with
the scandal. The film, according
to the Christie Institute, explores
the “tangled web of politics,

Woody Allen's
Purple Rose
examines film
as escapism

The Purple Rose of Cairo is a
movie-wilhin-a-movic parody of
movies themselves. In it Woody
Allen explores the idea of movies
as dream machines and escape
mechanisms. The film is set in
l9305 America, 2| time when
many escaped the hard realities of
life by watching moving picture
shows. The movie’s heroine,
Cecilia (played by, who else
given that this is a Woody Allen
film. Mia Farrow) is no different.

Cecilia is married to a boor.
Monk (Danny Aiello), who takes
the little she earns as a rather
incompetent waitress to keep
himself well supplied with
booze. She escapes daily with
her trip(s) to the movie house.
One of her favorite films is The
Purple [tare ofCut'ro.

One (lay Tom Baxter (Jeff
Daniels), the Purple Rarc's hero,
walks off of the screen,
exchanging reality for his fantasy
world. The rest of the film's ettst
starts arguing amongst
themselves and with the audience
about what to do. The movie‘s
producers send Gil Shepherd, the
actor who played Baxter, looking
for his creation. Cecilia’s dreams
conte true as both Baxter and
Shepherd fttll in love with her.

drugs. hostages, weapons,
assassinations, and the ultimate
plot to suspend the constitution
of the United States." This
sounds like the plot to a James
Bond movie, but the depressing
fact is that this film is a
documentary of what our

govemment has been up to in the

last decade. Also included are rare
interviews and footage of Bush
and his buddies exposing their
connections in the affair.
Cover-Up explores the story
behind the international scandal
that our government and many
reporters have attempted to keep

quiet. If you are concerned or
just curious to see what sludge
our current president has dragged
our country through, come and
see this documentary. If you
have given up hope for the
United States but are concerned
about how we have affected other
countries, especially Central
America, watch this "10"10. If

Viva Las Vegasjust
another Elvis Film

by Dayna Williams

Viva La: Vegas is one in a
long line of movies made popular
by the King, Elvis Presley. In
accordance with the genre of
Elvis movies, the King meets a
sweet and sexy young woman,
and romance and adventure soon
follow.

In Viva Lat Vegas Elvis
encounters the scantily dressed
(according to 1964 standards)
AnnrMargrct, who cons and
wriggles her way into the King's
heart. In order to keep Ann‘s and
the viewer‘s attention Elvis next
must move into action. In this
movie Elvis not only sings and
dances, but also swims, water
skis, flies a helicopter, and enters
the Las Vegas Grand Free. When
Ann discovers that Elvis has

entered the car race she fears for
his life: but all fears are allayed
when she instead persuades Elvis
to enter a talent contest. Will
Elvis and Ann win first prize in
the talent contest, will their love
survive?

If you have enjoyed any of
the other Elvis movies (Jailhouse
Rock, Blue Hawaii, Girls, Girls,
Girls, etc.) then you will
certainly be enthralled with Viva
Las Vegas. If the thought of
Elvis and a bevy of young beaur
ties dancing and singing their
way through the nightclubs of
Las Vegas repulses you, then be
sure to steer clear of this one.
