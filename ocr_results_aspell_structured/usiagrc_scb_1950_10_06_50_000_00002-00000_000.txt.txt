Living in a Democracy

In some ways, Grinnell college just isn’t real. We sit
in our happy, comfortable isolation, stirred by such mo—
mentous questions as whether the formal is a flower dance,
or what Miss Gleason will feed us next,

Meanwhile tired, dirty men, tattered remnants of a
once-proud division, are pacing steadily northward between
endless rice paddies A quiet meeting is held in a partly
rebuilt house, and the transportation sytem of a nation is
disrupted,

One of‘the most unpleasant things ,we must face
today is the fact that two live in one world. In 1945,
we were all enthusiastic about the idea,-while not real-
ly understanding it. One world, lwe said, and a U, N.
to handle it

Since then, we have come to learn much. One world
leads to great visions, not always our own. We are faced
with a tremendous world conspiracy, led by a revolutionary
creed, whose leaders have placed it opposition to our own.
Remember, We too were once revolutionaries

The paths the Soviet Union and ourselves have chosen
force us to consider another world war as a distinct pos-
sibility. We are both motivated by ideas which we have
adopted as national pholosophies.

All over the world, these ideas ,are in conﬂict. The
future of the ‘world for a good while to come will be
determined ,by which creed wins out. And ideas win
with words and action, mot by action alone.

Which leads back to us. This war of ideas is an all-
out one, whether we realize it or not. If we lose, it means
war, war on the worst terms possible, a beleaguered con-
tinent fighting, literally, the rest of the world. If we win,
there is a good chance of avoiding war. Even if war must
come, we will be much surer of winning it.

Our job is first of all to learn our own system, how
it works, and what’s wrong with it. Then, we must do all
we can to improve our system. Maybe you feel stupid the
first time you write your congressman, but it’s important.
How else is he supposed to know what you want?

Next, we must loam as much as we can about
Communism, its good points as well as its had, We
must learn what it has that appeals to so many peo-
ple, and what we can offer that is lbetter.

And for those who don’t care what those peoples think:
would you rather have a democratic India standing With us,
or twenty million Indian soldiers fighting against usl‘And
manpower is still important; we don’t hear the Americans
in Korea talking about a “pushbutton war."

If we can find any way to chip in, we had better use
it. The Crusade for Freedom needs money. It plans to use
it for education and propaganda around the world, If you
have any friends in other countries, write them. They are
curious about America; tell them about it.

Chess is being played today, with nations for pawns,
And remember, it’s for keeps,

SCARLET AND BLACK

Help! We ’re Invaded.’

_A strange new animal has swarmed over the campus
since upper-classmen parted from it last spring. It is am-
bulatory, usually roams about on its hind feet, and is easy
to spot from a distance by its red headpiece, A more rare
species is also adorned with green appendages about the
eyes, apparently to attract the less brightly colored females.

The mere presence of these hordes would not be objec-
tionable enough for comment, but their peculiar habits have
made their migration here particularly noticeable. We
would like to say that the beast is constantly underfoot.
But even that we cannot say. The natives are being trode
den upon dailyi They disappear in the black and red thick-
nesses of the swarm. 4

The scientific name for the animal is seldom used, but
its common name, PREP, has sufficiently defined it for all
but the most delicate observations. Some of its forms of
behavior are recorded:

it gathers in front of the bookstore each morning and
clusters in homogeneous groups, occasionally mixing with
similar animals of other species. It is a continual menace
to the natives with its seeming obsession to be first in
everytsort of line, group, or crowd. It loiters in clusters
about the bookstore entrance blocking in and out-going

traffic. , ,
Like great schools of fish these beasts descend upon

morsels of food in the campus dining room oftentimes
starving out the native of the species. '

Their greedy activities are not limited to their cam»
pus habitat. A trio of the beasts was observed in down-
town Grinnell where they blindly crowded several older
townspeople off of the sidewalks. ‘ ‘

They swarm out of the chapel on Tuesday mornings in
great profusion, covering the sidewalks and relegating
deans, teachers, and upperclassmen to the parkingiwhen
they leave space on the parking,

The 1950 species of‘prep has been treated more as
a domesticated animal than at any time in the past The
masters are wondering, in light of their behavior, if they
are yet ready for domestication. If the behavior persists
in this untamed fashion, more severe disciplines for the

beast will be necessary.
