SCARLET AND BLACK had hoped
to present to its subscribers With
this number a cut of the football
team. but is compelled to post-

pone its issue until Saturday.

THE RECENT election of W. H.
Burd as captain ot next year's
football team meets with the ap-
proval of all. Besides playing a
strong game in his position this
season he has shown that he has
a thorough knowledge of the
game and is well ﬁtted to ﬁll the
.DFﬁcc to which has been elected.
We are conﬁdent that he has the
ability to command the players
as well as direct the playing in
a game. SCARLET AND BLACK
wishes him all success as captain
of the '99 football team.

Our Coach.

Graduate coaching in Grinnell
has ceased to be an experiment
and has come to be a settled
athletic policy, a policy which
will be consistently followed un-
less untoward circumstances arise.
That this system of coaching has
been successful hereI while it failed
to bring about satistactory results
in other western colleges when
tried. is due largely to the untiring
and faithful effort of one man.
Mr. C. E. Harris. '96. who has had
full charge of the team for the
past two seasons. The work of
his proteges has steadily increase
ed in eFFlciency until this season
Grinnell occupies a position
second to none in the middle west

Mr. Harris has the happy iacul-
ty of instilling a dash and vim
into the play of his team which
carries all before it under ordin~
ary circumstances. He is par-
ticularly successful in his work
with line men and few teams have

made any ground tillough Grin—i
nell's line this season until it had
become battered to pieces by
superior weight. The exhibition
given at Minneapolis against the
Pennsylvania system this fall
when the necessary distance was
made by Minnesota but once or
twice in the game speaks highly
for Grinnell's defense. Mr, Hdr~
ris has succeeded in adapting the
play of his team to that of his ops
poneiii's more successfully titan
any coach Grinnell has ever had.
In both defense and offense this

larly so at Minneapolis when their
line.was broken and circled ale
most at will while ours seemed
impregnable. He has invented
many new alld succcsstul plays
while at the same time he has not
departed from the old system ot
play outlined‘ and consistenly
followed for ﬁve years here. and
has helped to establish for all
time to come a distinctively Grin-
nell system. ‘

He has been courteous but ﬁrm
in his dealings with the team. and
at all times has commanded the
respect and conﬁdence of a crit»
ical sttldcntcbody and alumni.
Should he have charge of the team
another year. we are conﬁdent in
saying that with the added experr
ience as a coach he would place
Grinncll in a class by herself.

All honor to our coach. who has
always had the interests of the.

college at heart and whose every.
action in connection with the team
has been for her honui and glory.
