Custom-made masks designed by Milton
Severe will be featured in the concert dur»
irlg a number entitled “Creatures."

Severe has created masks for a number
of years but the masks for “Creatures”
mark the first time he has designed them
for the stage. “These masks had to be
made for dancers to move around in,"
Severe explains. He is currently at work on
masks which have been commissioned for
the Des Moines opera. In addition, his
masks are sold ﬂirough Fernette's Gallery
in Des Moines.

Severe uses two methods to make
masks. One method involves using a tree-

substance. He uses acrylic paint' to
decorate the masks

According to B G. Voertman, director of
the Dance Troupe and assistant professor
of theatre, “Creatures" deals with a power
struggle between two characters: one
large and powerful and the other smaller
and less muscular. The characters are
played by a man and a woman, respective-
ly. , ‘

“However, the dance is not about the
struggle for dominance of man over
woman or vice-versa," explains Voert-
man. ”Severe's masks are intended to
make the characters more abstract,
thereby allowing us to explore our ideas

about size, power, and dominance. The

masks will allow the audience to identify
with any or all of die creatures. In fantasy,
we can be rid of ourselves and deal more
easily with ideas.”

Severe has exhibited in arm and crafts
Shows and was an artist-inresidence at the
Cultural Center at the Iowa State Fair.
Before enrolling at Grinnell College, he
studied art at the Kansas City Art lnsﬂtute
and acting at the American Academy of
Dramatic Arts, New York. He had a lead
role in Grinnell College’s production of the
“Piratﬂ of Penzance" last year.

Severe is the son of James and Virginia
Severe of Grinnell and is a two»time reci-
pient of the us. Grinnell Scholarship

Erendira

Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the ’

1982 Nobel Prize for Literature, first wrote
Erendira as a screenplay, then included it
as an episode in his great novel, One Hun-
dred Years of Solitude. After resisting
numerous Hollywood offers to film his
work Garcia Marquez decided to film
Erendira with the noted Brazilian director
Ruy Guerra, based on the author’s original
screenplay.

The story tells of a beautiful l4vyear-old
girl who, after accidentally burning down
her grandmother’s mansion, must use her
“only asset" to pay back the old lady. Sell»
ing her body across the length and breadth
of a vast desert region, Erendira becomes
the center of a fantastic caravan, a shrine
to commerce and carnality, attracting
devotees by the hundreds, with snake-
charmers gamblers. and musicians in
their wakea Then a goldenvhaired youth
named Ulysses appears, and Erendira for
the first time gives her heart as well as her
body.

Claudia Ohana plays the part of Eren-
dira and Irene Papas delivers a titanic
performance as the Grandmother e funr
ny, fantastic, and monstrously evil. The
film also stars Michel Lonsdale and Oliver
Wehe,

Erendira was filmed in Mexico in 1953.
Spanish with English subtitles. 103
minutes. Color.

The film is scheduled to be shown on
Thursday, March i3 at 9:30 p.m. in South
