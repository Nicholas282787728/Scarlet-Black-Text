Last Friday afternoon the college
Black Studies Committee, chaired by
Physics protessor Pete Smith,
clearly deﬁned tlle college's goals
in black studies and formulated sev»
eral important proposals, No defi-
nite plans were made for the Black
Studies major, however.

The committee made an official
commitment to submit a Black Stile
dies proposal to the Educational
Policies Sub-Committee. which
would consist of a Black Studies
major and interdisciplinary black
‘studies courses within the major,
Smith warned, however, that des-
pite the Committee’s support of
such a program a definite Black
studies program cannot be guaran-
teed.

Concerned Black students repre-
sentatives presented a program out»
lining their proposal tor a two-part
Black Studies program, consisting
of a curriculum outline for a Black
studies major and a component tor
students wishing to study Black
Studies without majoring in the sub-
ject. cos presented a list ofcoure
ses which they recommended for
the Black studies program, includ-
ing offerings in the fields of Liter-
ature, Anthropology, Economics,
Sociology, Political Science, Phie

, losophy, History, and Psychology.

Many courses related to the cul-
tural evolution of black people, the
intellectual and ideologicaldevelop-
ment of blacks, and the situation of
presenteday blacks including the
eitects ol segregation and urbani-
zation on modern-day black people.

Department chairmen have been
asked to give a short description
ot courses in their departments
which contain black culture com»
ponents, to indicate the amount or
student interest for a Black Stu-
dies program, and to describe the
teaching methods which would be
used in the instruction of such
courses.

Chairmen will also be asked to
describe possible courses relating
to Black Studies which the depart-
ment is not now ottering, but which
could conceivably be taught. Smith
will investigate these comments to
discover what manpower and exper-
tise would be needed to teach these
courses in the future.

The Committee is also heading a
study concerning black needs in
Mathematics and Science courses.
Dean Wall last semester stressed
the need for a special introductory
course in the sciences and the hu-
lnnnities--the Committee may ins
vestlgate this possibility as well.

Smith emphasizes that the Black
Studies program could benefit all

To Discuss Nasser Tuesday

A group of 2540 students met
Sunday and Wednesday and anr
nounced that an open meeting would
be held Tuesday night at 8:00 in the
South Lounge to discuss the parti-
culars involved in the recontracting
ot Alan Nasser, Philosophy. Through
the Student Co-ordinator's office,
the students issued invitations to
those most directly involved in the
matter: Nasser, the four members
of the Philosophy faculty, student
members of the Philosophy EPC
the chairman of the faculty and Ads
ministration representatives,

As ot Wednesday night, only John
Worley and Dennis lldas, Philose
ophy, and members or the student
EPC had agreed to come,

Nasser, who took no part in the
organization ot these meetings,
made it clear that ifstudenls wanted
to discuss his case, he would be
willing to release the Administra-
tion from whatever obligation they
had to protect him by notdiscussing
the particulars ot his case.

Howard Bul'klc, Philosophy, de-
clined to accept the invitation, says
ing that he would not itttcntl a public
meeting at which the particulars of
any one personnel decision were
discussed, lle did offer to discuss
his position with any Student in his
ofﬁce.

Neal Kiausner, Philosophy, also
declined to discuss particular per-
sonnel matters in a public forum.

Chairman or the Faculty Beryl
Clotlelter said Monday that “prOr
lessional ethics” would prevent him
from attending any meeting to dise
cuss a particular professor's case

President Glenn Leggett and Dean
Waldo Walker echoes Clotfelter’s
sentiments in formal statements re-
leased Wednesday. Walker's State-
ment said in part, “Even though a
faculty member wishes to have his
specitic case discussed publicly and
states that he wishes to release all
participants from the bonds ofconli~
dence, i still do not believe that it
is ethical for me to he a participant
in thc discussion....ns long aslsub-
scribe to this ethic, such public dis-
cussion would be, at best, one»
sided.” Leggett added in his state-
ment that ”Such an action would
quite likely not only damage the
individual concerned but would most
certainly damage the profession and
the College.“

in discussion with the Student Cos
ordinutor and the 5&3 , Leggett
responded to the charge that poll—
tical considerations might have been
involved ill the Nasser decision,
saying that It was simply not true
in his case.

Alan Nasser, instructor in Philo»
sophy, has had his contract termi-
naled under what he himself con-
siders “circumstances of inconsis—
tency and dishonesty."

On November 3, 1971, the Philose
ophy Department sent its recom-
lnendation to the Executive Council
that “the college not renew Mr. Nas-
ser’s contract.”

The procedure concerning contract
renewals invariably originates at the
department level, Dean of Admini-
stratlon, Waldo Walker said thattile
department, after taking its corres-
ponding EPC committee into
account, passes its recommendation
on to the Executive Council which
evaluates it and sends it on to the
President for final analysis,

In this case, the Philosophy Des

Grinnell student, noting that the con-
tributions of black people are not
recognized in America. In recogni-
tion of that need, the Committee in-
tends to institute such a program as
soon as possible, possibly by next
semester, although full development
or it may take several years,

Any proposal torhiulated hy the
Committee must be passed by the
EPC and approved by the laculty.

partnlent EPC recommended that
Nasser be rehired. The 3-1 majority
vote was based on the “demonstra-
ted fact that his classes this semes-
ter are his best ever,"

Department Overrule

The Philosophy Department, in its
recommendation by John Worley,
the department chairman, unanie
mously overruled the EPC decision.
The department also includes
Howard Burkle and Neal Klausner.

The report stated that Nasser, now
in his third year as instructor,
didn't fulfill his potential during the
fall semester of 1970-71 and that
his classes were even less favorable
second semester.

Nasser admits his “dissatisfaction
with his classes second semester,”
but asserts that he was under pres-
sure frum his dissertation all last
year

Both Worley and the EPC evaluate
Nasser’s tirst year classes as lzlr
above par ”First year the departs
ment gave Nasser apoweriul recoms
mentiotion with no reservation,”
Worley said. He stated that the sec-
ond year’s recommendation, tiled
in November, 1970, was “satisfaCr
tiny but not as glowing,"

One of the glaring ditlerences be-
tween the two years was the change
in Nasser's grading system, The
department report stated lhal “in an
attempt to lessen the importance of
grades, all of his students received

Women Faculty View Carolyn
Reid-Wallace With Favor

Last week Virginius Thornton
(American Studies and History) told
the Sch that a conflict surrounding
Carolyn ReideWallace, Assistant
Professor of English at Bowie State
University (now on leave and Serving
as Adjunct Professor of English at
Howard University), may have becua
central reason for a lot olthe recent
conﬂict on campus. Mrs. Reid-
Wallace is a candidate for the joint
appointment in the English and
American Studies Departments.

Mr. Thornton told the SKLB that
primarily because of opposition to
her trom women taculty members
here and because of constant check-
ing and rechecking of her cree
dentials, she probably would not
come here next year

Waldo Walker, Acting Dean of the
College, told the son Wednesday
that the College has not been offiv
cially informed that Mrs. ReidJVal-
lace has decided not to come to Grins
nell, Said Walker, “I have been in
conversation with her in very recent
days. She is a very viable
candidate."

The American Studies Department
has interviewed one other black
woman candidate for the position,
according to Charles Cleaver (Engv
lish and American Studies) Cleaver
told the son that of all the applicants
he and Mr. Thornton have talked with
during the lasl tew months, these
two seemed to be the most outstands
lng.

Walker also said that at the time of
last week’s incident in the Twentieth
Century Room, the college was not
yet in possession ofa complete set ot
documented credentials, and that it
is “not uncommon” for the College
to obtain “documentation” of cree
dentlals for candidates, so it has “as
much information as possible about
each candidate before a hiring de-
cision is made Among other things,
the College has checked willl George
Washington University to contirm
the status of Mrs. ReideWollace’s
progress toward the Ph. D. degree,

Cleaver also said that when Mrs.
ReideWallace gave a lectilre here
on January 25. she did not know she

was o candidate. Presumably this
means that all her credentials had to
be assembled by the College since
that time,

Walker also told the 8&5: “The
tacnlty women have clearly stated,
and l have witnesses to the effect,
that they have never expressed any
opposition to Mrs. ReideWallace,
because they support her appoint—
ment,”

In a letter to the $515 which appears
today on page 4, the lull-time pro-
iessional faculty women underline
the position stated to the 5&5 Tues-
day by Mary Wyly, neterence Lie
brarian in charge ofcirculatioll.she
said that the women who met with
Mrs. Reid—Wallace when She was
here “really liked her".

Both Bonnie Hampton (Music) and
Lynn Mather (Political Science)
were among the five tacully women
who met with Mrs ReideWallace.
Both emphasized to the 3&3 that
they were in no way part ot an otti-
cial interViewing team, but met to
answer Mrs. Reidawallace’s ques-
tions about the situation facing woe
men facility members at Grinnell.

Their Opinions about Mrs. Reidr
Wallace were never officially soli-
cited, but Miss Hampton said, ”My
opinion ol her was very tavorable,
and l expressed it wherever i had
occasion.” Mrs. Mather said sheine
formally expressed her favorable
impressions.

Mr. Thornton also told the 5513 that
Mrs ReidAWallace, who is indepen»
denlly wealthy, would have given the
college $10,000 other salary even it
it were negotiated as low as $12,000
per yezlr.

Walker told the 55:8 thatthe College
did not know about this. Healso said
that, although the Executive Council
had discussed the (act that the Col-
lege would have to otter starting
salaries for black faculty members
high enough to compete in the mar-
ket, no specific salary recommendae
tion was discussed. Walker said that
he and he alone decides what specific
salary offer to make to a candidate

once the Executive Council decides ,

that an otter should be made.

Volume 80 Number 22

'Ar' the first semester of1970~7l
and were allowed to assign their own
grades the Second semester of that
same year "

The EPC recommendation stated
that “blanket grades“ contradict
faculty rules and regulations.

Nasser finds fault in the present
grading system but concedes that
his experiment failed, worley does-
n't consider Nasser's approach an
experiment, but a disaster

“It is similar to going to court and
spitting in the judge’s eye,“ he said.
The report continued, that in 1971»
’72, “Nasser will follow neither of
the previously introduced grading
procedures."

The department recommendation
stated, “1 am forced to predict that
Mr. Nasser’s class administration
will continue to lower the educa-
tional value of his courses even
when he does a good job ot lectur-
lng.”

Sudden Departure

A second major consideration by
the department concerned Nasser's
abrupt absence trom December a,
1970 to the end of that semester.

"This absence was not excused;
indeed neither the chairman of the
department nor the academic dean
was intormed prior to his leaving,”
the report stated

In response to the Executive Couli-
cil, Nasser took issue with this. He
wrote that he had contacted Mr.
Worley by telephone prior to leav-
ing and had expressed to him that it
the department demanded his pre-
sence, he would stay, At that time,
he alluded to a personal emergency
situation as the cause for his de—
parture.

In a response to Nasser’s letter,
Worley told the Executive Council
that he did indeed receive such a
phone call, but that it was irrele»
vant to the matter. At that time,
Mr. Worley was not chairman ot
the department and was therefore
not in any capacity either to permit
or deny such an action. Worley wrote
that Nasser was told that the depart
ment had no objections as long as the
proper authorities ot the college had
been notified. Such steps were never
taken.

Nasser expressed displeasure not
only because of the original omis-
sion but because the department had
failed to mention theissue again until
it was brought up at a September lst
meeting with Mr, Worley. Nasser
cited a March lsi departmental
meeting in particular, ostensibly
held to discuss the department’s
dissatisfaction with Nasser, but
which was in fact devoid ofany men—
tion of his departure.

According to Nasser, he had
confided in Worley that some of his
course failures in 1970-71 had been
due not only to the pressure of his
dissertation but also to personal
