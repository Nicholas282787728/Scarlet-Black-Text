it was Senior Day at Rosenbloom Field last Saturday, and otter
the 400 fans in attendance thanked the i7 graduating seniors for
their hard work and participation in the program, both the Pine
nccrs and the nationallysranked St. Norbert Green Knights came
out fired up and ready to play.

“1 was proud of how we competed and the heart we played with,
but unfortunately, it wasn’t enough," said wideout Mart Tcetcrs ‘05,
after the Pioneers fell to the visiting Green Knights 45721.The loss
put the Pioneers at 4.4 overall on the season with a 3—4
mark in the Midwest Conference.

St. Norbert came into the contest atop the Mid-
west Conference standings and ranked in the top 10 in
the nation among Division 111 NCAA football teams.
Grinnell's offense and defense knew that the game
would be a challenging one, and almost perfect football
would need to be played in order to notch a victory and
preserve their perfect home record,

“Preparing for a team as good as St. Norbert is nev-
er easy," said offensive coordinator Jeff Pedersen, “but
every team has a weakness. In this case, we knew that
our receivers were better than their defensive hacks. so
we went into the game with an aggressive mindset, especially in the
passing game."

Pedersens game plan was overall successhil, as the oirense put
up 21 points on a nationally ranked team. Pioneer quarterback Scan

- Pfalzcr‘07 went 31 for 52, throwing for 343 yards and a touchdown.

, Teeters reeled in 10 catches for 148 yards, Chris Villa '05 caught
10 passes for 75 yards, and Trey Raney ‘05 added 73 yards on five
catches. Nate Wineiiiger ‘05 was held to 40 yards on 20 carries, but
scored twice, '

Pfalzcr and the offense answered each of St, Norbert’s two ﬁrst
half touchdowns with touchdowns oftheit own, including a 27 yard

touchdown pass to Tcetcrs. A late field goal by the visitors, however,
gave the Green Knights the slim advantage of 1744 going into the
half.

Both teams attempted to make adjustments during the intermis-
sion, but it was St. Norbert who controlled the ball in the second
halft

“st. Norbert impressed me with their speed on dcr
fcnse," said Pfalzer. “They flowed to the ball very well
and created piessure on key downs. But I think our of-
fense played well against tlicmt We were able to drive
the ball,yetwc failed to capitalize on all our opportuni-
ties."

St. Norbert did capitalize on their second half ops
perninlties, ontscoring Grinncll 28-7. Grinnell could
not find an answer for St. Norbert‘s running back Casey
Meehan, rushed for 254 yards and three touchdowns
on the day and went over 1,000 yards for the season. In
the and, it was a difficult defeat, but the Pioneers still
have a shot at finishing with a winning recoid this season.They will
have to take on Carroll College this Saturday on the road ﬁrst, and
finish up the season at Beloit conegc in two weeks.

“Ifwe win our final two, we'll finish at 674, 574 in conference,
which would be a big turnaround from last year," said Teeters, “That
being said, Carroll is a team with a very similar playing style to our-
selves. They're a good team when they want to be, and this will be
their last game of the season, so they'll deﬁnitely be fired up. But i
feel like, with the senior leadership that we have, ifwe play together
as a team with the same focus that we had against St. Norbert, we
can win the game.”

Champ

Women’s soccer wins the MWC
Title Game abroad after losing
it a year earlier in Grinnell

BY JOE GENI

Grinnell didn't avenge its conference loss to Lake
Forest last year. But no one’s complaining about it.

St. Norbert got to the top-seeded Foresters first,
outing them in the first round ofthe Conference Tours
nament last weekend. That left Grinnell, victors over
Carroll in the first round, to play a Green Knights team
they'd administered a 4,0 drubbing to at Varsity Per-
formance Field on Oct. 2.

“1 don't think our focus was on our opponent, “said
head coach Heather Banning, "This has been our phl—
losophy all yeariplay our style, our game, and we will be
the dominant team."

“We just wanted to win it," said Pioneer goalkeeper
Liz Carrier ‘07. “We watched Lake Forest and St. Norbert
play and St. Norbert was clearly the better team that day.
It might have been nice to avenge the loss to Lake Forest,
but as long as we won it didn‘t really matter to me“

Grinnell (12-4-1, 7-2 MWC) did win, but only of
ter a classic overtime affair that didn't end until the 96th
minute,when Sarah Evans ‘05 puta golden goal past Nor-
bert keeper sarali
h artinez on an
assist from Rachel
lVlOSkDWlIZ ‘06,

“Conference
is basically a time
wheie anything
could happen,"
said Carrier, “The
first seed lost by
so much, And it's
just a time when
not necessarily the best team is going to win, and we
realized that last year when we were clearly the better
team and losi.1t’sjust a matiei of working hard fui those
speciﬁc games and getting the win no matter what.”

That Lake Forest, unbeaten in the Midwest Confer-
ence this season, should suffer a so plastering on their
home field while Grinnell blanked a team it had lost to
the week before should come as no surprise to students of
MWC postseason soccer. Nor should St. Norbert‘s strong
performance against Grinnell despite their lopsided loss
in the teams previous meeting a month earlier. Then
again, that Evans, Grinncll’s allrrim: career goals leader,
should get the gameswinner in the title bout, or that
Muskowitz, the team leader in assists with 17 this year,
should set it up, should have been no surprise either.

“It's just the nature of the tournament situation,"
said defender Julia Bradleerook ‘05 on the unprer
dictable postseason, “No one really has that much of
an advantage based on the way they’ve done through-
out the season, so everyone's starting from the same
level, and I think they [st Norbert] just came out with
a lot of intensity and were willing to put a lot on the
line. They were in the exact same situation as us, so it
was a really tough battle."

One thing that has been dazzlingly consistent is
Gtinnell’s defensive dominance. The victory was Grin-
ncll’s sci/midi shutout in nine games, and their llrh of
the year. Grinnell is giving up 0.53 goals per game this
season, having surrendered only nine total.

“Since the beginning of the season, Heather has
spoken a lot on team dcfcnsc,"s:lid Bradlcerook, “so
even though we only have three defenders, all the field
defenders work as a unit to keep the ball in our offen-
sive zone as much as possible, and that has really helped
minimize opportunities the other team has had."

By winning the conference Tournament, the Pier
ncers advance to the National Tournament.They’ll find
out their opponent on Nov. 7 and play in the first round
on Nov. 10 at an as-yct-undetermined location.

“We‘re just gonna try to stay focused for the next
week, and then Heather will tell us who we’re playing
so we can address them a bit more in the last couple
or days," carrier said.

"This has been our phi-
losophy all yearmplay
our style, our game,
and we will be the
dominant team."
