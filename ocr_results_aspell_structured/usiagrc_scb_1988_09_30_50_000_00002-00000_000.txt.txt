Nanjing Fellows reflect on year in China

by Julie Kaster

It is 5:30 am. as Erika Lund
is jarred to consciousness by the
shrieks of children playing games
outside her window. As she
shifts her aching body on the un—
comfortable reed mat she longs
for her own soft mattress

In another room of building
number eight, Robert Hersh-
berger has been awakened yet
again by an unfamiliar face, the
third stranger to share his room
in four days.

Thus began the first of a five
year exchange agreementbetween
Grinnell College and Nanjing
University.

”the terms of the agreement,
established in 1987, include the
invitation each fall of two recent
Grinnell College graduates to as
sist with highrschool English
instruction at the middle school
associated with Nanjing Univere
slly in the People's Republic of
China. Participation in the Chi-
nese Studies Program at Grinncll
is not a requirement for selection,
though the exchange program is
funded by an endowment specified
for the Chinese Studies Program,

The first Nanjing Fellows,
chosen through a process of
written application and personal
intervtew, were 1987 graduates
Erika Lund and Robert Hershr
berger. Lund was a history major
from ‘Minneapolis, Miri ., and
Hershberger was a Spanish major
from Colorado. Neither of the_

Pioneers of the program, neiv
ther of them knew what to ex-
pect. The first few weeks tested
their decision to spend the year in
China. Hershberger became
acutely aware of the lack of im

personal space and privacy when
a mix-up in housing left him
with half a room, the other half
being used as temporary housing
for foreigners visiting for a few

Many times, Lund confessed,
she felt alienated and, "I wished I
was just ordinary again." She
also dreamed of sleeping on her
own soft mattress as she had dif-
ﬁculty adjusting to the read mats
which were used to provide
ventilation.

Lund and Hershbcrgcr’s expcr
rience improved once they had
been tutored and had learned
enough Chinese to "survive on"
(how to order food and ask for a
bathroom) and Were able to begin
teaching.

Teachers move around to different
classrooms, lecturing to classes
of fifty students who remain in
the same room all day. A typical
school day for the studean begins
with a 7:30 a. m. homework
period. This is followed by 50
minute classes running from 8:00
to 11:30 at m. with one 15
minute break for eye and body
exercises. Students go home for
lunch until 2 pm. and then rcc-
ognize a rest period, or "shoxi."
resuming classes at 2:30 p. m.
The school day ends at 5 pm.

The Chinese educational sys-
tem is very formal and rather
rigid, according to Hershberger
and Lund. A teacher stands in
front of the room and lectures
while students give choral rcr
sponsor, making the process very
impersonal. The main method of
learning is memorization. Lund
and Hershberger felt that so much
emphasis is placed upon simply
committing material to memory
that students are not allowed to
use their minds creatively, An-
other drawback to the system.
according to them, is that only
four percent of the students are
accepted into Nanjing University,
while the rest are destined to
work in the factories.

and Chinese inslntctors on other
days. They spent many hours
outside of class brainstorming for
material that would attract the at
tention of all the students, since
those who had little hope of en-
tering college generally saw no
reason to extend themselves aca-
demically. Lund and Hctshberger
discarded all grammar books the
first week as they strove for
lessons which would encourage
the students to use their
imagination and express some
emotiont

Hershberger, for instance, set
up an “American Culture Wee "
in which he taught. fun facts
about the U. S. presidents,
names of states, and types of
foods. During this week, which
seemed to be very successful. a
number of students lost their in-
hibitions and displayed various
breakrdancing techniques in front
of the class.

Lund felt it was vital to teach
her students that learning could
be fun. choosing to use a lot of
games and activities, such as
‘hangman', to get Lhem to think
creatively. "The students were
very receptive to this unique form
of leachlng and actually looked
forward to their classes with
Robert and myself," commented
Lundr

Despite the fact that Lund and
Hershberger taught rather inforr
mally and with a much different
style than the other teachers, the
faculty was very supportive of
everything they were doing.
Many parties and banquets were
held to celebrate the exchange
between Nanjing and Grinnell. .

Funding for Lhe Nanjing Fel—
lows was provided by grants
given to the Chinese Studies
program from the Des Moines-
bust-1d Gardner and Florence Call
Cowles Foundation as well as
The Mellon Foundation.

The Grinnell-Nanjing ex-
change program is actually a
continuance of a Chinese Studies
Program that was instituted 75
years ago. In l913, the college
