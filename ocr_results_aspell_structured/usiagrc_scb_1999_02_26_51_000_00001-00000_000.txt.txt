Blaze levels barn,
killing 700 sheep

A blaze visible for miles destroyed
a barn east ovariiinell early Wednes-
tltry, killing loo Sheep and lambs and
destroying the structure’s contents.

Orinncll Fire Cliicflerry Barns said
30 ﬁreﬁghters from here and Maleom
fought the flames, using an estimated
i2_000 gallons cfwatcr from pumper
trucks

The Fire occurred on the LaForest
Sherman farm, located about 3 miles
east of the city on the Pindcr Avc
extension.

A passerby on his way to work
spotted the names at about 3 am. and
notiﬁcdthcGrinncllFire Department.

“We could see the flames by the
time ivc got to Hy-Vec" on S. West
St., the chiei‘said. “So lcallcd Malcom
right away fora puinpcr. a tanker and
manpower "

The bath was engulfed in ﬂames
when ﬁreﬁghters arrived atthe scene.

“The roof and second floor had

fallen in, so we concentrated our efr
forts on the house, a corn crib and
another barn where shingles were al-
ready smoking from the heat," Barns
said.

Sherman reportedly was spending
the winter in Phoenix, Ariz. How-
ever, Greg Brown, who owned the
sheep being housed in the barn, told
authoriticsthathehad been atthebam
about midnight “and everything was
ﬁne," the chief said.

The barn also contained a consid-
erable amount of hay and a tractor.

Barns said some heat lamps were
being used for baby lambs.

“That probably was the cause," he
said.

Firefighters remained at the scene
until about 7 a.m. The remains ofthe
bani continued to smolder at mid-
morning.

“It’s going to be smoldering for
quite awhile,” Barns said.
