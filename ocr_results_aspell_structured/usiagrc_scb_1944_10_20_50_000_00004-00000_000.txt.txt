hen the demand for bus travel exceeds the supply, we

recall an old American sayin

”Tell the public (lie

truth. You can depend on them or divide (lie supply fairly

and without complaints"

Gas and tirc rationing restrict us from giving you all of the
service we would like to give, Manpower shortages liavl: liix

us as rhsy have everyone else.

Bus travel is a weapon. Use ir economically, as you con-
serve food, paper, ruhhcr, gas, tires and sin.

When bus travel is not up to our usual high standard:
picsre remember we are carrying 21/: times as many passen-
gets as we normally do in peace runes.

We, too, look forward so rho day when you will nor be
called upon to ration your travel, and a new day oi luxurious,

scenic bus travel will dawn.

The ingenuity of the Chinese
has demonstrated itself as
China's students keep on with
their studies against almost ln~
credible obstacles. One report
received by the W881? reveals
the use of a single textbook by
an entire class. Pages were
carefully cut from the book and
pasted on a series of bulletin
boards, glued only at the mar—
gin so that both sides of the
sheet could be read. Students
lined up to read the assignment;
the line moved slowly along as
knowledge was absorbed. The
system is similar to the well-
known Chinese wall-newspapers
which are now a national insth
tuti'on due to the severe short-
age of paper.

Three Dollars Asked

The minimum pledge of $3.00
which each Grinnell student is
being asked to make is enough
to provide a parcel which the
European Student neliei Sends
American prisoners, including a
sewing kit, two handkerchieis, a
mechanical pencil, writing pads,‘
and an English-German diction—i
ary. A sum 01 $1.00 will slip y
the notebooks and paper roquir-i
ed by a prisoner for S“ montlis,:
35.00 will provide irom one toi
six hooks, s15. 00 will support a‘
Chinese student ior a month;
$8.00 wlll enable a refugee stu—
dent in Switzerland to leave a
reiugee camp and study for a
month in a university.

During the seven years of the
wssrs existence, nearly $700,-
000 has been raised by American
colleges, prep schools and theo-
logical serninaries, Last year
alone $238,800 was raised, of
which $65,000 was spent on Eu,
ropean student relief, and $7,000
went to U. s. prisoners of war
in the Far East. The year the
goal is $500,000, of which 30%
will go to China for evacuee stu-
dents; 34.3% to Europe for pris-

oners of war, internees, refugees,
