AN OPPORTUNITY
VVithiu the n few days the students of
Grinnell college will have all opportunity to
ercise tllc pl'i ilege of selecting the leaders of the
Student Council by popular ballot—a privilege of
which they have been desirous for some time. \Vith
this franchise, they have had delivered into their
hands powers of a more purely democratic lla-

turc than most student bodies enjoy.

 

  

The election will find the campus fire of cone
'[lioting factions. pushing For office men and wom-
en selected rather for tllcir popularity than for
their fitness for office, \Vitll this absence of faCA
tional antagonism. with freedom to support whom
they please, the Grinuell students need kccp but
one thing ill mind, \Vllo is the best man for the
position?

Furthermore. since it is assured that tllt llC‘\\'
officials will enter office with no strings attached
to them from party affiliations with obligations
due no one except the students who have .
ed them. this school shollld provide a real
plc of what can he hoped for in stndcnl: self-rule.

 

If, however, such a high degree of sum is
to he obtained the camps lllust take seriously the
responsibili " whit-ll accompanies its increased pow
crs. The coming vote will exert a great influenrr
on the future of studellt government, on this came
pus. By taking a \vllolerilearted interest iii the
election. by giving careful consideration to all pro-
spective off cars before casting a ballot, and than.
by polling n 100 per cent vote, the students can
justify the more of the faculty ill allowing tho ill-
orcased powe by proving to the powers that thoy
intend to ttllic advantage of their opportunity.

 

 

 

 

 

ALL QUIET ON THE VALLEY FRONT

For the time being at least, the rumors coll-
ccl-lling additions to and withdrawals from the Mis-
souri Valley conference have been set at rest.
Tulsa and Washhnrll have definitely accepted the
invitation extended them to join the group, while
neither “Washington nor Butler have made any
move to withdraw front the circuit

The addition of two southern schools should
act in more ways than one to solve the difficul-
ties tllat have threatened the welfarc of the confcrr
once in the past. Both Washington and Oklahoma
Aggics, who had become increasingly dissatisfied
with the old arrangement, are providcd with foes
from their own territory. Rivalry already exists ho-
tween the Aggies and Tulsa, and shollld rapidl

Other Opinions I

WAR To END WAR
(University of Chicago Daily Maroon)

With flags, banners, parades, and emotions, student
associations with anti—war sentiments marched the cam-
pus recently. But flags. banners, and parades are war
symbols. Mob emotion is a prominent cause of war.

We are oppressed by the conviction that anyone
who will parade and wave flags against war will parade
and wave flags for war.

What anti-war associations accomplish by their
present tactics, is to train people in addiction to war
symbols. Transference of those symbols to a pro-war ate
titude is simpler to achieve than the original addition.

The only hope for opposition to war is cold, unemOA
tional rationality. Members of the University Antiwar
association should merely shrug their shoulders and say,
“If war comes, we, rational people, will not go under
any circumstances, because we have demonstrated that
war is irrational."

The courage required for that statement in the face
of war is so much greater than that of immediate brave
volunteers that it seems boundless.

STUDENTS IN POLITICS
(The Michigan Daily)

Differing from the average sightseeing group who
made Washington one of their pet centers of activity and
from the boys from back home who have political ax-
es to grind, were the groups of college students who
visited Washington during the Christmas holidays,

One group consisted of the ordinary, tea—drinking
assortment of college activity leaders who found this
adventure into politics somewhat of a lark, They hand»
ed Mrs. Roosevelt a bouquet of roses, passed several
resolutions, gnashed more, and had a grand ball and
banquet.

The other group, representing the liberal element in
the American eolleges of today, came to express their
opinions to the government on a number of subjects in
which they were vitally interested.

Secretary Wallace, addressing them, told them that
the youth to the United States was too smug, too com-
placent. and 1.00 self—satisfied. He denounced college
football as a racket, welcomed them as fellow liberals.
and praised their interest in the affairs of government.
Federal Education commissioner Zook told the other
groups that college students were “too darn docile." He
said; “They are too easily bossed, They don’t. create
enough problems for the colleges and universities."

Amazing words tbese, from Secretary Wallace and
Commissioner Zook. More amazing still. the reception
given the liberal group. Try to imagine a group like
the second being welcomed to Washington two years
ago with the status of “fellowdiberals.” it is signifr
cant and gratifying that Secretary Wallace said "liber-
als,” not Democrats. We are undergoing a revolution
In government and economics. It is encouraging to see
the government reaching out a helping hand to the lib-
eral leaders who would make the college more than a
place to make the team or get elected to an honor so-
ciety.
