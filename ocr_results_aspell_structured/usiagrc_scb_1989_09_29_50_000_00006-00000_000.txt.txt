Students Against
Censorship

The issue that might soon come before Judicial Councili
in a case in which a student is allegedly being charged with
harassment for denigrating hippies on posters — deserves the
thoughtful consideration of the entire campus community.

This is no frivolous issue; the freedom of speech of every-
one on campus could be at stake. Recent events at Tufts
University, in Medford, Mass, point up the seriousness of the
situation.

' In a new university policy intended to protect students
from harassment, Tufts defined three levels of “allowable
speech.” Varying degrees of expression are permitted on
campus only within defined zones.

In public areas, anything goes — at least anything legal.
But in enclosed areas 7 including classrooms and dining halls
i derogatory or demeaning speech can be restricted and the
speaker hauled off by campus security.

Tufts has redeﬁned the concept of free speech. Tufts stu-
dents now leave their Constitutional rights to freedom of
speech at the university gate.

And what sparked the new restrictions? It was a sopho-
more selling T—shirts that listed “15 reasons why beer is better
than women at Tufts.” Grinnell‘s case, which involves not T-
shirts but posters, sounds similar.

The Student Government Association passed a resolution
Wednesday nightcondemning the espousal of violence against
members of the Grinnell community. And SGA has the right
idea: condemn the offender, loudly.

But don’t censor. A ban on offensive speech here would do
more harm to Grinnell — academically and socially — than
would the speech it would forbid.

Let’s hope the members of Judicial Council see the neces-
sity in keeping an academic environment tolerant of all kinds
of speech. Let’s hope they realize that freedom of expression
——'in the words of Tufts student Melissa Russo —— “is perhaps
the most valuable educational tool of all."

Once again, Israel is in the news.
This should come as no surprise for
historians amongst us: Israel and the
Jews have been in and out of world
attention for the past 4000 years —

for existence in the Arab world. As
has been the case for the past 4000
years, this struggle is one of sur-
vival, Perhaps a little history is in
order.

On Nov. 17,1947, the UN. called
for an end to the British occupation
of Palestine, and a division of the
region between the Jews and the
Arabs was made. By May 15, 1948,
Israel declared independence, but
the Arabs did not. Instead, they sided

The Bush Administration‘s ”War
on Drugs" dangerously oversimpli-
ﬁes many complex issues. It is mis—
leading and narrow in its interpreta»
tion of both the “drugs" and the
“problem" which are affecting our
country and the world.

For political reasons the admini-
stration has chosen to overlook the
single most abused drug — alcohol
— and the primary means of carry«
ing out violence _ guns — in what
must prove to be a futile and incon-
sistent effort to rid the nation of its
most recent scourge. Sadly, the cure
will prove to be a huge detriment as
it perpetuates the lie that all prob-
lems can be solved by military force.

The administration' s arbitrariness
in using police power shows its dis-
regard for the basic civil rights of its
citizens and the favored status it at-
tributes to moneyed interests in
general. and political allies in par—
ticular. These are the foundations
for our govemment’s new Bill of
Rights.

The most crass example of over-
simpliﬁcation in the “drug war" is

attack, the present»day Gaza Strip
and West Bank were swallowed up
by Egypt and Jordan, respectively.

The Arabs of Israel, taking sides
with the seven attacking Arab na,

of their brethren lands.

How could these countries treat
the refugee Arabs of Palestine in
such a manner? After all, weren't
they on the same side? Why didn’t
Jordan or Egypt— who are today so
concerned over the rights of the
Palestinians — set up a Palestinian
state on the Gaza Strip or on the
West Bank?

Israel has always known the an-
swer to this question. The Arab na-
tions' intentionswereclear: they kept
their Palestinian brothers from en-
tering their expansive lands to stirup
hatred, to use these refugees to “push
the Jews into the sea." Yes, they
actually preferred to treat their Pal-
mtinian friends worse than cattle,
degrading them in camps. denying
them any rights or education, and
murdering them when convenient,
in order torealize their fanciful goals
of an Israel-free Middle East.

In September 1970, Jordan killed
thousands of Palestinians in an
Amman refugee camp within a
matter of weeks. And Syria, Egypt
and Jordan have all kicked out the
violent P.L.O., and have expressed

Equally inconsistent is the

and although state legislation ban-

this right is established in the
Constitution, but in a context now
obliterated by the violation of an-

The right to bear arms is granted
