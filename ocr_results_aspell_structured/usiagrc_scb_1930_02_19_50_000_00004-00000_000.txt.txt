Says Langan Has Smoothest

Most Stars.

It has proved a difficult task this
one of selecting allrdoml material,
because of the inconsistency of the
players. One day a man would look
like varsity material and the next
game would prove him ready for the
Smith hall team. But teams have
finally been chosen from the men
who have played three games or
more and who showed reasonable
ability in handling the ball.

Many will doubtless be surprised
.to find only one member of the
championship teams from Langan on
the all-teams, If two smooth-work-
iiig‘ quintets which played together
as a unit were to be chosen, Langan
would be given the preference, but
the teams from Two did not produce
many individual stars, and hence it
is hard to place their men on an all-
star team,

Rowe Is Outstanding

Rowe was the outstanding shot
this year and unquestionably rates a
berth on the team. He has proved a
threat in every game as an offensive
man, and he has a stonewall on the
defense. Bradford has confined his
activ ics to football and much of.
Four‘s success lay in the ability of
this man to prevent opponents from
scoring. He was good for occasional
points himself. No man in the B
-divlsion did as much as question
”Red” Heldridge’s bid for the center
berth. He was Dibble's “hot shot"
as well as the main cog in the team.
of every game he participated in.
Moving up to the positions where
you have to play pretty test, we
find Lichty, another Dibbietite, and
McCurdy of the championship Lair
gan team. Lichty had difficulty in
finding the basket ‘for a time but he
soon snapped out of it and often
dropped in sorely needed points. Mc-
Cui'dy was third high scorer and his
quick—thinking. his handy passing,
and his knowledge of the game often
saved Langan from possible defeat.

Spencer Is Good Shot

The A team was the harder to
pick, because so many men looked
like Sllrdorm material. But out of
all the chaos we find five men who
if put on the floor. would make a
scoring combination.

Spencer of Smith was a dead eye.
He did not reach his capacity has
cause of the poor support he receiv-
ed from the hands of his team mates.
But when he did get a chance to
shoot, two points usually went down
in the score hook. “Pat" Ferraro
was about the only consistent shot
throughout the season. He was right
in the thick of things from the start-
ing whistle to the end of the game,
He was a good shot, an uncanny
dribbler. a fast passer and above all
a believer in teamwork. McIlrath
rated the center job because of his
speed in covering the floor and his
"fight."

“In the Next Room” with Jack
Mullmll and Alice Buy; a First Na-
tioual release appearing at the
Strand tonight, Thursday, and Frle
day,

I shan’t tell you about the murder
that occurs in the film’s prologue and
makes a modest departure by saying
“but that would be telling,'l Such a
statement would be inexcusable,

Instead I shall generalize and say
that mystery and mirth go hand in
hand toward a climax which few
will guess.

“Devil—Mity-Cztre" With Ramon
Navarro and Dorothy Jordan; mt
MGM production. Appearing at the
Colonial tonight, Thursday and Fri-
day.

Following Bonaparte‘s exile to El«
be, one of his lieutenants. Armand
(Navarro). is captured and sen-
tenced to death. His escape brings
him to a room in a roadside 11:11. A
demure Royalist maid (Jordan) un-
tcntionally hides him, She reveals
his presence to the searching party
because of her patriotic devotion But
Armand never forgets her.

History and Waterloo are barely
respected; the purpose is comedy. A
reproduction of the gardens of Ver-
sailles is done in Technicolor, Na-
varro's singing is pleasing.

Navarro becomes infinitely more

ed good dependable basketball most
of the season and deserves real cred-
it for the splendid showing of his
teams. We wanted a strong guard
for this outfit. and Blesier just seem-
ed to fit right in. Bob, sometimes
playing brilliant ball, was right there
all the time and it took a plenty
good man to get past him. McIntire,
bulwark of the Kelly Stables aggre-
gation, again finds himself on the eul-
dorm team. There seems to be lit-
tle question as to the reason. Just
ask any man who played against
him. McIntirc is a good shot and he
was the nerviest and steadiest player
in the league.

Briggs of Langsn, pinch hitter and
guaranteed to win any overtime
game; Kent also of Langan, a fast
and a dead shot; Murray of Clark,
a good man on any team; and Klesel
who almost single-handed led Three's
B team, deserve a super-honorable
mention for their services in basket-
ball games this year.

attractive in this film which marks
his talkie debut.

“Seven Days Leave" with Gary
Cooper and Beryl Mercer; a Para-
mount production. Appearing at the
Colonial Saturday, Sunday. Monday
and Tuesday.

Gary departs from the art of
silent shcba love in this picture,
The story has the emotional appeal
of "Four Sons” and “Toler'ble Da-
vid." It is an adaptation of James
Barrie's “The Old Lady Shows Her
Medals."

A childless Scotch charwoman
(Beryl Mercer) loves to boast to her
friends that she too is sacrificing a
son in the war. Her pride carries
her to a mental adoption of a hero of
the "Black Watch" regiment (Coop-
er). His discovery of her pride and
love and his proposal to her are high»
lights in the story. >

I am glad to see Paramount at-
tempt such a dairing theme.

“Street Girl" with Betty Comps
son John Harron, and dock Oak-c; a
Radio production. Appearing at the
Strand theatre Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, and Tuesday.

Four members of a band in New
York’s “Little Hungary" adopt an
improvised violinist known as “Fred-
die" (Miss Compson). The attention
of a European prince secures a good
job for the band but brings trouble
to the local competitor (Haironl.

Miss Compson did not resort to a
double during her violin solos. An
affadavit signed by a notary sub—
stantiates that. The songs intro-
duced are proved favorites.

The picture has been a success.
Perhaps Gus Arnheim's band, the
support of Jack Cakie and Eddie
Kane, and the desirable Miss Comp-
son are responsible.

Two pictures that are worthy of
your attendance am “Gold Diggers
of Broadway" and “Anna Christie."
They will be here soon.

Jeanette MacDonald of whom
you saw quite a bit in "Tim
Love Fatima" will wear a hula shirt
in “Let's Go Native." Another step
in Paramount's expansion program
is a new administration budding.
