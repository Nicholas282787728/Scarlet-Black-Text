Wise up: time to get self-gov in writing

7/ .

 

For all of recent memory, student statt’
training in August ended with an infor-
mal question and answer session with
former Vice Piesident of Student Affairs
Tonn Crady. Chat-
ting with 8A5 and . -

HSCs, he candidly '
addressed the drug

and alcohol policy
ofdie school.

crady empha-
sized that the ad-
ministration does
not want to impede self-governance or
promote a culture of fear of the adminis
nation. Instead, he reported, the goal is to
provide npport for students with concerns
or sti kysltuations,

For the past thrcc decades, Crady sei ved

Qear 53“?"

Clarity found“

I spent the last five days of winter break
sitting on the floor. Literally. You might think
that I am crazy, but seven othei people joined
me so it couldn’t have been completely insane.
In fact, I was participating in the Buddhadhar-
ma’s five-day winter retreat, lead by San Fran-
cisco zen Priest lngen Breen.

We could only rinse enough money from
the Student Planning Committee (SPC) to
cover our instructor’s plane ticket, so two
Grinnell residents allowed us to use their
house as a meditation studio, participants each
contributed a small sum of money for food ex-
penses, and lngen agreed to spend the week in
Grinnell for no fee. It’s a miracle the retreat
was able to come together.

What did we do the whole time? As Int
gen put it, “We meditatcd,wc ate some food,
we went out in the snow, we came back, we
meditated, we ate some food, we went out in
the snow"But don't be fooled by the simplicity
of this practice. We practiced a particular sort
ofsitting, devoid of all distractions. lngen in-
structed us in two meditation techniques: one
which develops concentration through breath-
counting, and another which cultivates come
passion for ourselves and for all sentient bce
mgr. In the evenings,Ingen lectured on topics
common to Buddhism.

How did all ofthis meditation make us feel?
Well for one, after staring at the ﬂoor for five

as future on campus, fostering sclfegovcre

nancc and ensuring the previously mentioned

policies. But with crady's departure for Bar

mouth, it isn’t clear if the administration will
stick to the system he
defended,

Many of Grinnell's
policies are institutionv
alized in the cultuie
rather than in printed
handbooks. They rely
on informal precedent.
Consequently, the

turnover in the college's administration could
have a profound effect on student life. As new
adn ristiators come to campus, informal self»
governilnLe guidelines Will be subject to rein-
terprctatiou.

And intcrpietation of self-governance

days straight, pretty much everything became
extremely fascinating, Cleaning my refrigera-
tor the day after the retieat was suddenly vivid
and exciting compared to counting lint-balls
on the ﬂoor. I also left the retreat extremely
energized. I always feel clear, grounded and
concentmted after meditating, so a week of it
makes me feel a bit like superwoman, ready to
tackle my last semester ofclassesl
Finally, five days ofmeditation left the cone
tent and happy. This may have been related to
the fact that we spent a large portion of the.
retreat wishing well-being and happiness to
others, producing a buildup ofpositive energy.
I know from previous experience that being on
a retreat produces positive effects months after
the retreat has ended. I am excited to see what
possibilities this semester has to bring. Happy
new year, Grinnell!

Undervalued?

What is the value of a Theatre 8c Dance or
Public Events ticket?

There is no financial cost, right? The tick-
ets are free to students, faculty and staff, and
the public.

However, these departments have invested
both budget dollars and faculty and staff time
to produce these performances. students have.
labored both on and behind the stage to prose
cnt them as well, I would argue that these ticke

doesn’t just take place on the third floor
of the jRC. Residence Life Coordinators
(RLCs) serve in the trenches—making
self-governance decisions every day. These
advocates for the greatcr student commur
iiity historically worked not to “catch stun
dents in the act" but instead to encourage
students to take responsibility for their ac
tions. But RLC guidelines for implements
ing self-governance are also nebulous.
over the course ofthc next year, admins
istrative dynamics will likely change. The
departure of Crady means new staff will
interpret and define selftgoverance with
out the input of the administrator largely
responsible for institutionalizmg it.

ets arc clurte valuable

So why then is it, after distributing all of
the tickets. that the opening night perfor—
mance ofA Midsummer Night’s Dream had
42 of 120 seats empty even AFTER seating
everyone on the waiting list? Having well over
30% ofour patrons not show up is absurd! The
St. Petersburg Ballet performance of Carmen
is another example. Out of 460 seats, we sat
65 people from the waiting list. Where were
the 65 people (just over 14%) who picked up
tickets but didn't show?

The worst part is that these are not isolated
occurrencesIt happens with everyTheatre and
Dance and Public Events performance.

I feel that since ticket holders can just walk
up and pick up a ticket, investing only the time
it took to vmlk and/or stand in Line, that there
is no perceived value to the ticket. I'd be will
ing to bet that ifpeoplc had paid for the ticket
and that ifthey wctc not going to use it, they'd
return the ticket in order to get their money
back. Why aren’t people returning unwanted
tickets now? Selfishness. lrresponsibility. lge
norance. Laziness. Sense ofentitlement.

We all want our shows to be fully seated.
So next time you pick up a ticket please be sure
that you really intend to use it. And, if your
plans change, please be considerate of others
and return the ticket to the box office so that
others may enjoy these performances.

Revealing forbidden love: Malewitz stands up for country

In this era of polarization, someone has to speak on behalf of middle America—and Jim Malewitz ’09 will be that man

Just for the purposes of qualiﬁcation. the following state-
ment has no correlation with the fact that I hail from a blue»
collar town which touts itself as the birthplace ofthe Republi-
can Party (gross,I know). It doesn't have anything to do with
the fact that the father of my best friend at home can almost

always be seen around town weat~
ing his trademark cowboy hat.

I'm just going to come out and
say it: sometimes I ‘takes deep
breath“ enjoy listening to coun-
try music.

I can't believe Ijust came out
of the closet. I never even thought

I’d have the coumge to out myself on plan secrets, let alone in
this fine campus publication. But here 1 am, defiantly standing
whilst preparing myself for the mob of pitchforkrtoting stur
dents who simply cannot believe that I could write something

in such poor taste.

Maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe the readers will instead res
act with rolled eyes or indifference, Maybe I'm not the SilCi’iﬁ’
cial country music lamb I make myself out to be. BeSides, ifwe
subscribe to the stereotype, countiy music fans constitute those
with the monopoly on pitchforks anyway.

What is it in
this age of “anything

Americans,

our generation, to so

abhor a little twang in their tunes? Is it simply

the sound of the music? I honcsdy don’t think so I deem this
phenomenon a result ot the broad and often uninformed Catt
egorization of which we are oftcn

ilty.

Do I honestly yearn for a world filled with "achy breaky

hearts" and “axes in Texas"? No, because in my opinion, those
songs absolutely suck. Although sometimes it’s fun to listen to
them just for a laugh.

You don’t have to adopt my tastc in music. But I would like

us to move us away from stereotyping that which
we may not itnow. it seems that hatred for count
try music srcms not from simply judginga genre
based on a few of its lesser songs, but rather as
a result the entire oppositional mindset which is
rather easy to adopt: conservative vs. liberal, rural
vs. urban, and Alien vs. Predator"‘.
