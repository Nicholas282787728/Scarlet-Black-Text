Parker Duofold Pens from his perilous

One pen struck on asphalt, the other
on cement—away they bounded into the

We wanted to give the public proof
more convincing than any guarantee. So
we have shown by a.sel‘ies of heroic tests
that the new Parker Duofold Pen with
Permanite barrel does not break. Be sure
no fall on corridor or classroom ﬂoor can
harm it. Q

The most welcome call
to smoke ever sounded

NEVER was there a smoke invita-
tion that could compare with
"Have a Camel!”

On swirling city streets. In the
roadster as it bounds over the hills.
In the study or by the ﬁreside, no
other smoking phrase is so pm-
vocative of enjoyment and friend-
ship. In its realization comes a
boundless sense of gratitude and
‘contentment.

,l That is because Camels are the
f favored smoke of millions of ex-
i’ pericnced and successful men. To

ever-increasing millions who have
tried them all, who could well
afford to pay more, Camels are the
ﬁrst and only choice. Since the
dawn of smoking, there has never
been a success like Camel’ .

Camel preference is the inevi-
table expression of Camel quality.
No other cigarette made is like
Camels. No other smoke was ever:
so smooth and mellowy mild. For
your own high pleasure, we invite
you to rise to the world’s most cele-
brated smoke call. Have a Camel!
