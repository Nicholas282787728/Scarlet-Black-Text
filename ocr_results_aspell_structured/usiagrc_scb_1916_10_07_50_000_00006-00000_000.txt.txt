the ettcct oi the intense heat on the
players. Schulz, entering the game

Isive game in this quarter. He made a
twenty yard run around right end, and
followed it up with a dri e through
tor a touchdown. Augustine kicked
goal. Grinnell gained at will through
the Simpson line, and the visitors
played listless hall. “Dad" Hoyt was
placed in Smith's tackle at the end of
the quarter.

Fourth Quarter.

THREE EXPERT BARBEKS.

\io WAiTs.
Finishing work has begun on Griir ‘

iicll‘s new recitation building, and it
is hoped that it will he ready ior ocs
ciipancy sometime in November, al-
though no promises arc being made by
Business \lanagcr L. v. Phelps as lo
niien it \ ll be completed.

Boides the interior iinish work
which has begun, plastering and stair-
ways are being put in now. The lay-
mg or rioo . is also absorbing much
time at present.

Although the new Alumni Hall goes
by the name of Recitation building, it
brings many convcnienc s and mum
vations besides recitation rooms.
Among these the auditorium will peiu
haps be used by a larger percentage
of the students. This room, with its
balcony, will seat 450. It is a minia-
ture theater titted with a stage, n tine
moving picture machine, whose uses
will be innumerable and all things
which go to make a model lecture
room. Some or the larger classes will
be held here, such as Protessor Ryan’s
public speaking class. and the Harv-
ard Exchange, and other visiting lec—
ture ,.

The top tioor will be occupied by
the social sciences and the department
or Religious Education and Applied
Christianity. On this tioor will be one
of the greatest improvements. A s
ciai science study, two—thirds as large
as the present library reading room,
has been provided tor. All rcterences
tor economics, sociology, history and
political science will be in this room,
as well as pamphlets, magazines and
ncnspapors pertaining to these sub-
jects. There will be reading tnblcs,
as in the library now. Ono end of the
room will be left for charts and dia-
grams used in this work.

This is applying the laboratory
method to social sciences, and will ,
make the work of students in this do- -
par-tinent more interesting and protit-
ttble. it will also relieve the conges
_. tion of the library so noticeable this
tall.

The second tlcor belongs to the dc-
partments ot psychology and Ethics»
tion, French, Spanish, Latin, and
Greek. These courses will be greatly
helped by the spacious classrooms.

The English and German depart-
merits will be on the ground iloor. it
