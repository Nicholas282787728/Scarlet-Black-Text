Ms. Ward told the Scarlet and
Black that she received her infor-
mation from Scott Truesdell.. who
was notaparticipantwhen Election
Board met in a membersrenly exe-
cutive session to discuss and vote
on the outcome of the grievance.

Mr. Tmesdell was informed, in
accordance with Article 3, Section
20f the bylaws. thathe could appeal
the Election Board decision to
ludCol No appeal has yet to be
ﬁled.

The Scarlet arid/Black feels litat
thedctails of the grievance hearing
should be made public. We
understand the importance of the
agreement to keep the hearing
confidential,buttheconfidencehas
now been broken. In releasing the
information regarding the hearing
to DiannaWard,whohnspublicized
it, one of the parties that was
involved in the agreement torcmain
confidential hasbrokenconﬁdence.

It seems only fair that the
mcmbersofElectionanrd,wilhout
concerns of breaching ethics.
should have a right to reply.

“As I become more and more
aware, all I see is examples of
hcleroscxualily,” said Kizzie. “It
just implies that there is no other
way."

For example, she suggested how
scldom she sees two men or two
women holding hands despite the
high numbers of openly gay stu-
dents here.

“II we consider ourselves to be
so completely open, why is that the
case? It seems to me that that
would be preuy uncomfortable.“

 

WORLD: Liberals Should
Rethink Outdated Solutions

education spending as a percentage
of GNP (ignoring figures on real
spending per sutdent).

Abortion, that great liberal lib-
erator of women has become one of
the most common forms of birth
control in the nation. 40 percent of
all women obtaining abortions are
repeat customers.

Free speech, one of iibetalism’s
more noble pursuits has now be-
come one of its most pitiable vic- ‘
tims. “Sexist. racist. classist, homo—
phobic, cthnocentric, religious and
culturally biased" speech is effec-
tively prohibited on most of the
“better”collegecampuses. Indeed,
ascollegeswhereonceplaceswhere
the free discussion of ideas was
encouraged, they are now indoctri-
nation camps. Note, for example,
our “Global Warming Awareness

Wee “ program. Question, were
there any speakers at all who
questioned the global warming
theory? Was the other side of the
story even presented by the col»
lege? Is it ever on any topic'.7 The
answer is one two letter word that
starts will! “N".

The big liberal trend now seems
to be the attempted justification and
rationalizationofabignastyReality
slapping liberalisminthe face. Sure

enough, they have an answer for ,

everything. "‘The people in
Nicaragua were voting to end the
US intervention in their country.”
Funny way to show it by voting for
the US-backed candidates. “The
US was being imperialistic and
warlike when itinvaded Panama to
oust Noreiga.” 95 percent of the
Panamanian people would tend to
disagree. "Marx's ideas were
corrupted and abused by power

hungry individuals." Every time?
Could this be a pattern I see
developing? “Racist, sexist,
homophobic...etc. speech has no
place in our society.” Even Thomas
Jefferson said, “Error may be
tolerated where tmth is free to
combat it.” We’ve see this holding
true world-wide, and suppressing
“offensive"speechandthoughtonly
subvens it. The Azerbujnnis still
hated the Armenians even after
years of the Soviet vgovemment
.telling them they could not.

Perhaps it’s time for all those
“open-minded" liberals out there
to start rethinking their policies.
As goodAimentioned as they are,
if something proves itself to be
ineffective, only a fool supports
its continuation. If you don’t
watch out, the world may leave
you behind, clinging to your
defunct “solutions."

the Panama intervention, and called
for multilateral U.S. approaches to
the problems of the region and the
stregnthening of the U.S. com-
mittment to the OAS. Apparently
this is meaningless. Since he is not
anoutrightsupponer of the Marxist
insurrection in El Salvador, he is
nothing more titan an imperialist.
His comments that 95 percent of
Latin America is now democratic
are not refuted by making reference
to the depressing situation in Gua-

temala. The fact is that, in Brazil,
Argentina,Bolivia, Chile, Peru and
many other countries (in which the
bulkof the LatinAmerican popula-
tion lives), there are now elected
civilian regimes which are actually
mnning their respective countries.
He did not claim credit forthe US
in noting this factJte merely stated
that it is a signiﬁcant improvement.
He said that U.S. debt policy could
help to strengthen the stability of
democracies in Latin America.

these unthinking partisans of the
perceived “left" have something to
do with the fact that in Latin Amer-
ica (Brazil, Peru. Nicuragua) the
left seems tobelosin gelection after
election?

Regardless of the views of Mr.
Linowitz and the Sandalistas who
dispute them, isn’t the medal sup-
posed to be awarded for distin-
guished public service? Must it be
for“politicallycorrcct”public servv
ice? Mr. Linowitz has attempted to
serve his country for many years.
He has shown his disinterestedness
by rejecting offers of cabinet ofﬁce
from Presidents Johnson and Car-
tcr. He is respected by individuals
of diverse views all over the Hemi-
sphere. He is an old fashioned
liberal. He is not a trendy, knee-
jerk, shallow, anti-American leftist
and apparently thus he is not wor-
thy of an award.

HadHarry Hopkins himself been
alive today there is doubt he would
have passed the ideological litmus
test that Petras and Berger seem to
impose for medal rec entsl

Yet that’s not always the case.

“It‘s so neat to be at a place
where’s there‘s a les/bi/gay Pride
Week, and people will buy shirts,
people who’ve never even thought
of themselves as gay and who don’t
need to worry about people think-
ing that they are," said Pyle.

Over the years, the lesbigay com-
munity has also matured.

"There's a lot more available on
campus: social groups, coming out
group, GLGA, One in Ten. When
I first got here," said England,
“There was just GCGC (Grinnell
College Gay Community). If you
didn’t want to be political, you
didn’tdo anything asan openly gay
person. There are many more les-
bian, bisexual and gay people who
are willing to call people on homo-
phobia, to raise the issue, to bring
up heterosexism inclasses. In some
respects, the campus is growing
aware of a need or diversity, and
that diversity is not justskin color."

Walen and Simmons feel that
simply being open contributes to
decreasing homophobia. Being
confronted personally with an is-
sue makes it real. not just some-
thing thathappenedsomewhereelse
to somebody else.

“If you’re going to be lesbian or
bisexual or gay. the mostimportant
thing is to be out,“ said Simmons,
“because it helps other people who
are in the closet to be out, and it
helps those who are out, [though]
it’s notaseasy forsomepeopleasit
was for me. It's apersonal choice.“

Being out often empowers the

individual and the community.

“In the last your I've been out, as
in,outin public,"said Bloch,“[I’ve
been] moreconfideitttn myselfand
my feelings. I feel a lot freer. It's
very empowering to be pan of the
community here.”

There is still plenty of room for
change,however. AtGrinnell,moro
women than men tend to be be
openly out and involved in political
or social issues. and men may feel
left out

“I’ve spent most of my time
with lesbians.” said England. Most
of my friends through high school
were women, I felt more comfort—
able with women than with men.
Up until recently, men made me
nervousbecauseldidn’tknow what
to do around them."

“What I‘m ﬁnding now is that]
really want to be pan of a commu-
nityofmen,butnotin thecontextof
hanging out at the bar. rm‘ hoping
to find a men’s community that
encompasses more than sleeping
around at the bars."

“In this society, most of the time
you have to be somewhat cautious,
not to the pointol living in fear of
your life, but you have to stop and
think about what you’re doing, how
people will react. There are times I
feel like I‘ have to second guess
everybody. At the [NAMES Proj-
ect] Quilt, I didn't have to worry
about people rejecting me for the
simple reason that I‘m gay."

What lesbigays and their allies
are striving for is to possess the
right to live without fear.
