Budget Cuts made to help endowment

BY MATT liacichLL

Beg ng iasr fall, Grinneil Collcgc faced a financial crisis,
The Co cgc's cndowmcnt lost 20 percent ofits valuc sinchunc
30, 2003, dropping from 31,47 billion to 51.1billion,The Cole
lcge relics on its endowment for a large portion ol‘its funding,
Respondrng to the heavy endowment loss, the Budget Steering
Committee decided to slow spending for the student body.

“Unlike most places, we don’t slash the budget all at once,"
said President of the college Russell K Osgood. “The way
the endowment spending policy works [is that] it slows down
spending over several years."

The spending policy currently allocates 4 percent otrhc en-
dowment's money to annual cxpcnscs, but prohibits using 100
pereenr ofrhe contribtrrion for annual operation costs. A fracr
tion is thus put in a reserve fund. This year the reserve fund is
woith about $65 million.

“This capital reserve is a part of our cndowmcnt spending
that we’re using to replace our facilities,” said Trcasiiiei ofthc
College David Clay. “it‘s there for airy kind ofstrategie Condi-
tion and it's also there to be a buffer to protect us from uncx-
pccrecl events like this."

Tire Budget Steering Committee increased rho cost oftue
itron and room and board by 3 pe enr in order ro make up
for the reduced endowment. Additionally, the committee inn
creased scholarshrps, grants and aid by 13.3 percent,

“The cutback as much as the thou ht thc could considr

Gabe Schechtei ’12, who sits on thc Budget Steeiirig Com-
mittee.

According to each institution's i-espcctive wchsitc, the eco-
nomic downturn has affcctcd liberal arts colleges and univcrsh
tics across the nation St, Olaf Collcgc in Northftcld, Minn,
lost 24 pcrccnt ofits endowment value. Carleton Collcgc, also
located in Nortlificld, announced hiring and salary freezes. Ber
loit College of Beloit, Wis announced a 10 percent staff cut
after an unexpected drop in enrollment led to a 51.2 million
operating loss. According to the Stanfoid Report, Stanfoid
University's endowment is expected to lose 30 peicent of its
value this year, its biggest hit to date.

“liltcrcstingly..ttlic biggcsr cuts have been attuthc swankie

they had made the most promises about the future

they had a lot of hugely expensive buildings..,[though]
the budget may have gone way down they were still spendrng

Karen Voss, Vice Picsidcnt for Finance and Associate Trea-
surer, maintains a sobei optimism.

“We know it’s not over yet, and we just have to be cautious,"
Voss said. “But the entire campus is engaged in it, and as 1 said
its preserving the program and meeting need,and it's been very
successful so far."
