Hoover Admits lchNNELL FRESHMEN

Conditions Bad,
Payne Believes

. Professor Talks to ‘Y' Men
on ‘Domestic Politics’;
Tariff Log-Rolled

"The democrats scored a decided
victory in the election the ﬁrst of
this month. although they did not
gain control of either house,“ said
‘Prof. Charles E. Payne, head of the
Grinnell college history department,
at the Young Men's Christian assoc-
iation meeting Thursday night in the
clubroom of Dibble hall.

Professor Payne, speaking and lead—
ing the discussion on "Domestic Poli—

tics," brought out a number of reh- .

sons for the general dissatisfaction of
the public for the present administra»
tionl

Tariff Cause of Unemployment

The unemployment situation and
depression of business was cited as
the chief reason. Over-production for
the local market and the present high
tariff, which prevents] exchange of
produce and goods with other coun»
tries, is not considered by the 'tlver-
age voter as the cause of unemploy-
ment. However, the general depres-
sion of world trade is making unem-
ployment an issue in every industrial
country.

"President Hoover made a mistake
it the beginning of the administra-
tion by "saying that there was no
business depression. and that unem-
ployment Was exaggerated. He has
ﬁnally grudgingly admitted that con-
ditions are bad.”

That the high tariff was put through
-as a log—rolling measure was brought
out by the speaker.

Democrats Fully Satisfied
other facts and opinions disclosed
in the discussion pertained to prohibi-
tion, the public ownership of utilities.
and farm relief, all of which have not
been settled satisfactorily u n d e r
Hoover's regime.

“The electlon of two additional
democrats to the senate and 44 more
to the house places the republicans in
the position in which the minority
party wants them. The democrats
want the G. o. P. to be in power in
order to take the blame, and yet not
be of Sufﬁcient numbers to have
things its own way."

» Freshman Eleven
Closes Schedule
With Tutor Team

The Grinnell freshman football
team will play its second and last
game of the season this after-
noon. when the little Pioneers
match strength with Iowa
Teachers freshman in Cedar Falls.
The locals won their first game at
the expense of Broken bullpups, 6-D.

From advance reports the Cedar
Falls bunch looks pretty good, al-
though the little Tutors have not had
an opportunity to show what they
can do against real competition.
The Pioneers on me other hand have
proved that they can function as a
team.

Trumbuu's Dislocated Am

The local squad will present pram
tlcally full strength, the only man
lost to the team being Mllrk Trum-
bull, who dislocated hlS arm in a re-
cent practice.

Coach John Truesdole plans to use
lu his starting lineup Crews, Welsh. or
McKee at ends; Lake and Canavan
at tacldes, Roseubloom and Erwln at
guards, Faunce at center, while in
the backfield Waite will probably
call signals, Loynachan and Craw-
ford play halfbacks, and Rose, full-
back. other backfield men who may
be called upon are Saum, singer, and
Santi.

Shortens Christmas

Recess Period

Thanksgiving vacation will include
Friday, Nov. 28. as well as Thursday,
Nov. 27, according to an official an-
nuoucement made to The Scarlet and
Block this afternoon by Miss Bethana
McCandless, registrar. The loss of
school work will be made up by the
subtraction of Monday, Jan. 5, from
the previously announced Christmas
holidays.

The‘ present schedule dismisses
classes between 4:30 pm. Wednesday,
Nov. 25, and 8 am. Monday, Dec. 1,
for the Thanksgiving adjournment.

student Council Responsible

Christmas vacation will extend
from 4:30 pm. Friday, Dec. 19, 1930,
until 3 a.m., Monday, Jan. 5. 1931.

The change in the Thanksgiving
recess was on recommendation of the
student council, made about two
weeks ago, with the suggestion that
one or two Saturdays might be set
aside for Friday classes missed. The
Saturday arrangement was deemed
unsatisfactory, and the addition of
Friday to the vacation depended upon
ﬁnding an adequate method of com-
pensating for the loss in class time.

Tried First Last Year

Holding classes on Friday after the
November holiday was tried for the
ﬁrst 'time in.recent years in 1929, the
plan having been evolved by the fac—
Lulty in response to faculty and stu-

of Vacation Travels

in Korea, China

“Chinese temples are very much
overrun. The Chinese seem to be los-
ing what little religion they had,"
declared Donald Feasler in speaking
before members of the Cosmopolitan
club Tuesday night in the associa-
tions’ building. Fessler spent the last
two years teaching in Crtonell-ln-
China at Techcw, Shantung.

“It is the Japanese who are keep—
ing up the beauties of their temples,"
Fessler went on. .He was describing
vacation tours which he took in the
Orient. “We had to take off our shoes
to enter a Christian church in Korea.
We found the men on one side, the
women on the other, and a lot of little

corn."

East spoke of many of the pictures—
que qualities of the Orient. The Jap-
anese of Korea wearing their tradi-
tional colorful costumes and wooden
sandals while using modern trains
and automobiles, a mountain climbed
by a ﬂight of 6.600 steps which has
existed for over two thousand years,
since before Confucius, the beautiful
Nine Dragon mountain overlooking
nine lakes, and the Waterfall of the
Nine Dragons were among the items
mentioned.

Remaining undefeated through—
out the 1930 football Season in the
four games played on Ward field,
a light Gl‘lnllell college football
team, minus the services of foul-
regulars, ended the Pioneer sched-
ule here last night by routing a
heavier Iowa State Teachers col-
lege eleven, 12 to 0.

"Snap" James made the first Grin—
nell touchdown after G012 bud fallen
on a fumbled punt on the Tutors‘ five
yard line. Douglas put the ball over
for the second score in the fourth
quarter. when after recovering his
OWn fumble behind the line, he raced
around left end without interference
for the touchdown.

Teachers Threabeu Twice

Douglas was the only regular back
in the lineup. James, McCreary, and
Ullrlch. three second string men,
played the entire game. They all
backed up the line with good de-
fensive Work, and were Consistent
ground gainers. Christofferseu and
G011 were the outstanding men in the
liner

The State Teachers grldmen made
two threats on the Pioneer goal. At
the opening of the game they took
the ball from midfield with a series
of line plunges to the Gr—lnnell one
yard line, Where they lost the hall on
downs. Captain Douglas kicked out
of danger from behind his own goal
