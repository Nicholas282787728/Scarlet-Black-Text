Phillips Wins
Steiner P ize
in Playwriting

Virginia Riniker Receives
Award for Production
Last Night.

Friederlick is Judge

‘The Scoop’ Best Written Play;
‘Faith Cure Man’ by ﬁam‘b
Gets Theater Prize.

By SYLVIA JoSEPH.

“The Scoop," a play of newspaper
life by Richard Phillips, won the
Henry York Steiner Memorial prize
in playwriting, it was announced af-
ter the ﬁrst presentation of the three
original one-act plays on Monday
evening. The Experimental theater

. prize for production was awarded
Tuesday evening to “The Faith Cure
Man." a play of Negro life in the
south, written by Clifton Lamb and
directed by Virginia Riniker.

“The Scoop,” which received the
votes of two of the three students in
advanced playwriting whom Prof.
George Pierce Baker of the Yale de-
partment of drama appointed as
judges of the playwriting competi-
tion, received the award on the basls
of superior plot, the judges’ critic-
isms stated. The plot was more
complicated than that of “The Faith
Cure Man,” which relied for its ef-
fect to a large degree on the scenery
and the quality of the acting.

Dialogue Wins

The device which “The Scoop” us-
ed of catching the law-breaker by
having his words recorded on a dic-
taphone has been used before, but the
excellent dialogue held the interest
of the audience even after it had be-
come apparent what the end of the
play would be, The scene, the edi
torial office of a small city news-
paper, was realisically reproduced,
and all of the parts were well taken.

Lee Henson, as Big Bill, the political.

boss, was especially good.

“The Faith Cure Man,” to which
Prof. James Fiederlick of Drake uni-
versity gave the production prize and
which received one vote the playwrit-
ing prize, was the most impressive
of the plays from an emotional
standpoint. The acting of Margaret
Napier, Myrna Adams and Russell
Peterson as types of the simple
Negro of the South and of William
Schmaedecke as the Faith Cure Man,
who took advantage of their simplic-
ity and religious faith, was unusual-
ly one. The scene and the individu-
al characters were real enough to
produce a vivid emotional effect on
the audience.

"The Law" Dif cult

The criticisms of the judges stat-
ed that “The Law,’ by Robert Swift,
was an attempt at something rather
too difficult for college work, and

Dibble Defeats

Building Three

Champions Take 6-5 Contest
in Extra Inning Tuesday;
Ruff Outstanding.

The Dibble hall baseball team cap-
tured its first and perhaps hard-
est game yesterday afternoon when
it outbatted the Building Three
nine to win 6 to 5 after an extra in-
ning.

Ruff pitched a beautiful game for
Three, only to have his chances
spoiled by poor support in the field.
“Kike” Wilhelm pitched his usual
steady game. The game was mark-
ed by frequent errors, making the
game considerably more exciting.
Eddie Brown of Dibble, catching for
the first time, muffed a couple of
important passes, allowing men to
steal home. Kleaveland, Three's
third baseman. pulled a “fast one,"
when he managed a double steal, go-
ing all the way from second to home.

Building Three led for four in-

for Grid Season

The 1930 football team of Grin-
nell college will play eight games,
five on foreign gridirons and three
on the home lot, according to the
schedule approved Monday by the

slight revision in the schedule in
case lights are installed at Ward

looks probable. Four of the Pioneer

played under the lights.

The Schedule includes 5. trio of
conference contests and games with
Detroit university and Marquette
university as probable headliners.
Creighton, Cornell and State Teach-
ers are scheduled to appear here

Ploneer Motif Features 1931 Cyclone
Which Strikes Campus at 12:50 Today

The 1931 Cyclone struck the Grin-
nell campus with unexpected force
at twelve-ﬁfty this afternoon. blow-
ing off the covers of five manholes
and exposing fivc piles of year books
inside the holes guarded by the edi-
tor, Arline Cole, and business man-
ager, Bernard Tebbens, together with
members of The Cyclone staff. As
soon as the debris could be cleared
away placards were set up and lines
were formed to receive the annuals.

The Indian and Pioneer motif of
the annual appearing this noon is
particularly effective and of peculiar
significance to Grinnellians. Carried
out in the modernistic cover design.
the map of the Louisiana Purchase
inside the,front cover and the draw-
ings in the opening sections most
favorably introduced the group write-
ups, pictures and features.

Pictures of winners of the popu-
larity contest. Miss Kate coggeshall,
'31, and Mr. Carleton Humphrey, '31,
are featured in the year book.

The feature section is in itself
good, Unusually clever take-offs
and nonsense poems cover most of
the faults and foibles of campus
celebrities and campus customs.
Snapshots set forth nearly all the
important events and people of the
year.

heath, is an innovation in mid-wes-
tern year hooks and The Cyclone is
the first to introduce this device.
Sub-division pages show clever pen-
and rik drawings of- an amusing
significance. The art work is on the
whole well selected for The Cyclone’s
purpose. The first drawings picture
the coming of the Iowa band, the
Cyclone, the building of the school,
and the Grinnell of the future. The
annual has further emphasized the
drama of Grinnell's history as set
forth in the pageant, “Pioneers of
Progress," presented during home-
coming last fall.

Theleditor, business manager and
members of staff have presented the
1931 Cyclone to the campus with
imagination and foresight.

Dulze’s Proteges
to\ Meet Carleton
in Track Contest

Out of the shroud that covers all
track prospects early in the season,
the welfare of Grinnell on the cinder
pathways this year will be determin-
ed when Coach Lester Duke's pro-
»teges swing into action for the first
time lthls season against Carleton
college at Northfield, Minn.. Satur-
day. lThe meet will be the first dual
of the year.

Grinnell won from Carleton last
season by a 79 1-2 to 51 1-2 count.
Carleton had everything their own
way in the distance runs last year
and it looks as if this should be
their strong point again this year.
It is probable that the whole Pioneer
track squad will make the trip.

McCandless Finds Old Things Done

at Grinnell New at Other Colleges

 

By FRANCES LOUISE PECK.

“Sometimes I had to smile,” said
Miss Bethana Mccandless of Grine
nell college after her return from the
meeting of college registrars held in
Memphis. Tenn, “when I heard re-
gistrars from other colleges report-

ing as new practices the things which‘

we at Grinnell have been doing for
some time.”

”There were so many university
representatives, with problems very
different from our own, that I ﬁnd
it hard to say where Grinnell stands,"
she said when asked abou-L Grinnell's
ranking. “However, I will say that,
while we are conservative in a great
many ways,’we are coming forward
with the other colleges of our type."

“While we were in Memphis we
visited a new college, Southwestern,"

 

said Miss McCandless, “This name
is one of the president's hobbies. He
does not call it southwestern univer-
sity. or Southwestern college, but
just Southwestern. It has beautiful
new buildings, all of which are built
for the future, I don't know how to
describe their architecture, but they
reminded me of pictures of Oxford.
Everything is beautiful inside, too.
and it is easy to see how much pride
the ﬁvc hundred students take in the
buildings."

“We had the best time of the year
to see Memphis. continued Miss Mc-
Candlcss, “for spring is in full
bloom there. It was especially in-
teresting to watch the progress of
spring as we came North. In the
Ozark mountains we could see every
stage in the coming of this pleasant
season."

In the popularity contest con-
ducted by The 1930 Cyclone, Carle-
ton Humphrey (above) was elect-
ed the most popular man at Grin-
nell by vote of the student body.
