Dear 3E3

Another Cure for Hangover}

I was amused to read the discussion of
hangovers rn the 10/10 article by Darcy Ward.
it has been so many years since 1 had a hang-
over that the memories are a bit blurred, but
the one instantaneous hangover cure I discov-
ered lives with me today as it was instanta-
neous and lasting, it happened in the spring
of 1945 when I was in the armored infantry
of the 2nd armored division, Armored infan-
try means you travel between battles in lightly
armored half tracks but light on foot The

Germans were rrrnning but would stop to
fight periodically. That afternoon we had just
captured a large town which had a big factory
staffed entirely by slave laborers from Poland
and Russia and France saying they were glad
to see us was an enormous understatement,
and they invited us to join their celebration
that night.

The last thing I remember about the Cole
bration was drinking from a large cracked cup
3 frery brownish alcoholic beverage. When i
woke up in the morning] had the grandfather
of all hangovers with every nasty symptom you

So what if Barack Obama is

He’s not. Brit what ifhc were?

With his enormous success thus far, there’s
a palpable feeling that America is nearing the
apex of democracy by finally putting asrtle rts
racial plejlidices and judging its public stir
Vants on merit.

Not so fast folks- it isn‘t morning in Ameri-
cn just yet. Along with rnillrons ofothci Amer-
icans, l'vc bcen watching the nastiness of the
right-wing whisper campaign against Obama's
faith with disgust
and revulsion, Since
the beginning of his
campaign, detractors
have used Obama’s
middle name to
spread viernus lies
about his faith.

They‘re vicious for two reasons, First, the
perpetuarors ofth‘rs lie reject his stlongest per
sonal beliefs not on the basis ofhis actions, but
on circumstances completely beyond his con-
trol, Secondly, they use the word Muslim as
a descriptor mutually exclusive with American
Values.

This election has seen the label "Muslim"
turned into an epithet without the slightest
effort at a critical discussion. It’s destroying
the already miniscule space that Muslims have
to participate in our democracy. slanderous
doesn't begin to describe it,

Even scarier is the fact that individuals in
positions of responsibility on the right have
publicly engaged in this repulsrve behavior.
For example, in an attempt to provoke the
crowd’s jingoistic passrons, SheriffMike Scott
introduced john McCain at a Florida rally by
encouraging them to “leave' Barack Hussein
Obama wondering what happened" on Elec-
tion Day.

Elsewhere, the leader of a Republican
women's group wrote a lettcr to a newspaper
publicly declaring, “I believe Nluslims are our
enemies" and that Obama “Is a Muslim sociale

ist". This is bigotry at its most obscene,

Brit the worst ofit was revealed on Sunday
when Colin Powell mentioned hearing "senior
members of [his] party drop the strggcstron:
he's a Muslim and he might be associated with
terrorists.”

When did the labcl“1Vlusllm"get to be the
nrud in political mudslinging?

The reality is that the bi try we've seen
over the course ofthis campaign reﬂects deep-
seated reservations
Amci icans have
about Muslims,

In a 2007 poll
conducted by the
Pew Research
Center, 45 per
cent of Americans
admitted they would be less likely for a cane
didate if her or she were Muslim. Which is
why I can understand Obama’s reluctance to
defend Muslims against these smeais- hiit it
still doesn’t make it right. Ifrhcrc‘s been any
group “thrown under the bus” in this election,
it’s been American Muslims.

September 11th wasn’t the beginning of
this resentmentThe stereotype ofthe Isiarno-
fascist terrorist is well worn in America. The
radical fringe that perpct
trated 9/11 has resoiindt
ingly failed to convince the
world's 1.3 billion Muslims
that violence and conﬂict
are intrinsic doctrines of
their religion. But somehow
they've managed to per~
suade many elements of the
American media and vast
portions otthe American public,

It's true that much of the blame rests on
the international Muslim community for fail-
ing to keep its house in order. The distrust
Americans feel towards Muslims .s perpetu—
ated by the unchallenged medieval versions

 

”ill/5 election has seen the label
’Mllsll'm’ turned into all epithet
without the slightesl efforl at a
critical (locust/0n.”

could think of but was all alone in the halfe
track. The first sound I heard was the nut
rnisrakablc lugh whine and whistle of a high
velocity artillery shell passing above my head.
In a time much shorter that that it took me to
write this line, my hangover was gone and I
was in the ditch beside the road with my fel-
low squad members.

The hangover never came back that day. so
if you want a sure cure for a hangover 1 can
recommend this. Of course I only got to use
it once and it might pose a few problems in
duplication.

a Muslim?

of lslam propagated by an outspoken frrnge.
These ideas need to be forcefully met in the
marketplace of rdeas by the huge majority of
moderate Muslims. But at the same time, it‘s
hard to see how moderate American Muslims
can meaningfully aftect the discussion if bigt
oted demonization is allowed to foreclose on
the possibi ity of their participation.

Which is why the voices of people like
Colin Powell are so important in keeping
America holiest. ln res )onse to accusations of
Obama being a Mu m, Powell replied, “the
really it answer is, what if he is? Is there
some g wrong with being .r Muslim in this
country> The answer's no, that's not Amer

n Muslims have chosen not to
protest their ugly denionization out of cone
tern for the potential damage it could cause to
Oblii'na’s campargn.

Obama represents the hope ofall minorr
ties, including Muslims, that democracy in
America will reach its apex: a society based on
freedom and equality,uninl1ibited by consrdr
erarions of race or erhnierty. Sadly, if he were
pressed to detend Muslims on principle, he
might lose crucial votes.

Until the close of this election, it remains
distressing for American Muslims to face
the deep»sented distrust
of their compatriots in
silence. Especially since
sortie of them have made
the ultimate sacrifice in
serving their nation. On
September 17th of this
year, a friend of mine from
my Sunday school years
was killed by an IED in
Afghanistan. Lieutenant Mohsrn Naqvi knew
full well the imperfections of his nation, and
he served in spite ofthem. Burl can't help but
think he would be disappointed in the prejur
dice orour debate today.
