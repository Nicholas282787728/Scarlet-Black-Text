Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

several nspecrs of thc organization of
Wednesday's proresr ar die Forum disrurbed
mer

The organizers conflared drree disrincr is.
sues: die social problem ofrape, rlae judicial
prooess ofrhe college, and rhe legal srarus ofa
specific individual. in addressing rheir legiti-
mare, serious, and necessary concerns arbour
rhe former two issues, die organizm unforrue
narely also presenred a misleading message
abour che lauer issue. speakers ar rhe proresr
commendably avoided discussion ofche 5pc»
cifrc case. However, 1 fear that irresponsible
damage had already been done.

At rhe endeobseason svimming and div-
ing rearn banquer Tuesday evening, one ofrhe
principal organizers utiliud rhe general one
nouneemenr period so srare drar “today rhe
college acquitted rhe rapisr."An email to rhe
lso mailing lisr die non morning alleged: "yes.
rerday, a rapisr ms acquirred on our campus."
An email message ro all scudenrs followed:
“Recenrly, rapisrs have been acquirred
drrough rhe Grinnell collegeludieial Ptoccss,"

onTuesday, die hearingboard had announced
rhar rho respondenr in rhe case was innocenr
of rho charge. To lahel Lhat individual a rapisr
seems slanderous.

Perhapsl am nor beer suired to submit rhese
complaints because I am a personal friend of
rhe former respondenr. Nevertheless, I do not
wrire rhis lerrer on his behalf bur rarher on
behalfofrhe college commumry, Grinnellians
are supposed ro possess a eommrrmenr ro im»
parrial iusriee and levelheaded reason. Discus-
sions ofimprovemenrs ro rhe iudicial process
need to be clearly demarcared offfrom die pat—
rieulars of any case, By insinuaring rhar rhe
hearing board decision is auromariorlly invalid,
rhe proresr's organizers did me enrire college
communiry a disservicc,

lfanyone believes my analysis ofrhe siruae
rion is ineorreer, I welcome yourviews. Until
I see evidence refuring rhe hearing board deci»
sion, lwrll persisr in my crirreism of conrra—
dierory slogans and misleading messages.

Sincerely,

Dear Bdiror:

We are wriring ro express our dissaris.
faenon wirh rhc process of SGA elecrions
rhis week, We feel rhar rlre llrh hourwrire.
in campaign for Rachel Melis was an unfair
end-run around rhe rules rhar regulare SGA
clcctions. As a Wri[:»in, Ms. Mciis was not
required ro follow rhese rules,parricularly
rlrose prohibiring slander of opponenrs.
Wednesday's lornr Board meering requiring
Ms. Melis ro srrike rhe firsr line in her state»
mom or inrenr is a refleerion of rhe Violas
non of eleerion regularions. If anyone can
run ns a wrrreein candidate, and nor be sub.
ieer ro SGA regularions, why would anyone
ﬁlc as a eandidare ar all>

We are also curious abour Ms. Melis's
morives for seeking SGA office. If Ms.
Melis was so keenly inreresred in rhe presi.
dency, why did she wair unril more rhan
rwo weeks pasr rhe filing deadline, and a
single day before rhe :iection, to announce
her candidacy? This is especially unserrling
for rhe esrablishmenr ofan inrelligenr elec.
roral discourse as Ms. Melis was nor in
volved in any of the open forum elecrion
discussions or debares. We find her Stated
reason (dissarisfacrion wirh currenr can.

didares), to be somewharlacking. lnorher
words, we ouesrion Ms. Melis' commire
menr ro rhe presidency ifshe cannor even
decide'wherher she wanrs it or not unril
well afrer everyone else had made up rheir
minds.

\Vtth rccenr srudenr governmenr eleerion
problems ar Harvard, Duke, UCLA and
Porrland Srare, we feel that a conrinuarion
otrhis rrend hcre ar Grinnell is uuforrunare.
Mosr srudenrs here rcjcct rhe rrend to be
come "more like our poor insrirurions” on
academic issues, we believe rhcy would re.
ieer a rrend to become more like rhern in
srudenr governmenr elecrions as well.

LABYRINTH

Walking a labyrinth is
a form ofbody meditae
tion or prayer, that
leads to deeper connece
[ion with the sacred.
The winding path of
the labyrinth is 21 mir-
ror for our present life
and a metaphor for our
own personal spintual
journey. Itengagesthe
right brain, opening us

WALK

A lobyrinilr is an
ancient pattern bas'ed
on the rucred geometry
of the circle and spiral,

to creativity, imagery,
imagination, and intu-
ition. A labyrinth
shows us that no time
or effort is ever
wasted; ilwe stay the
course, every step,
however circu1tous, it
takes us closer to our
goal of experiencing
the deeper dimensions
oflife.
