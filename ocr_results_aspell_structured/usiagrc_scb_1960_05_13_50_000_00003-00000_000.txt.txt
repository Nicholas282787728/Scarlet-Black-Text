To the Edito

I would like to suggest a
modest proposal, in keeping with
the present established trend
of Grinnell college, to be used
as the future admissions pols
icy.

since Grinneli is now prie
marily a business concern, it
should be operated with more
crriciency.

1 suggest that all iuture prosA

pective students submit sealed

I

bids (minimum of $2,500) for
the opportunity of spending
nine months with this corpora-
tion, the highest bids being
selected by the admissions cle~
partment for acceptance,

This will eliminate the need
tor recruiters and will ease the
badgering ot alumni
“friends or the college" for funds.
Money formerly used tor stu—
dent aid could then be used to
increase iaeulty salaries in or-
der to gain their approval of
this new system.

This modest proposal would
virtually assure the college at
obtaining a clientele from the
better ramilies and would
eliminatc those undesirables
oi middle class origin who oc-
casionally manage to gain
admittance with the assistance
oi scholarships and gi'antssins
aid.

Any prohts realize
program could be reinvested
in paddle—tennis courts, trees
and shrubs and custom—design—
ed turnishings tor the new
buildings.

This letter concerns the Sec-
annual Grinnell all-Cam-
mud-andewater‘ fight,

and
pus

class children want to play in
the mud on Spring Day morn.

ing, there Should certainly bells the lirst event of the season,

no ubjcchoiisiif, that is, they

. quietly play outside and leave

the mud where they rind itl,

Maybe your mothers clean up
aiter you at home, children,
but our maids and ianitors

have encugh to do wmmut be_lpi-oinises to be an exciting show:

ing expected to clean an ample
coating of mud off the loggia,
steps, doors and even llobbics
or the women's halls.

it might also be brought to
your attention that perhaps this
fine new Grinnell tradition
should be voluntary. Somc pear
pie would have preferred Sleep»
ing to mud fighting on their
holiday. I don’t know what time
the uproar began, but it scrv-
ed as my alarm clock at 8:30.

And Mr. Mullins: locking the
library was rather less
sidcrate and childish than th
brawl in which you so enthus

iastically participated W’CdnCSr‘

‘To the Editor:

We do not object to the

Spring Day, but we do wonder
what cause Dick Mullins
thought he was supporting by
his participation

To quote lrom Mr. Mullins'

letter to the editor concerning
lthe chaining or the library one
night a iew weeks ago:
i “What was this momentous
ltask that mobilized the energies
loi some oi our sterling young
men and made them respond
,to the point or Violence?

"th it a humanitarian deed,
to blow ior basic
freedom, the start oi a great
lcause? No, it was none of these.
it
iof their need for attention.”
‘And just what was your great
cause, Mr. Mullins?
