which has existed between these
classes all the year. Home meet
will be held one week later, May
5th, and as this gives the track»
men only two and a half weeks'
training after Easter vacation, it
is necessary that they commence
their preliminary training imme-
diately.

The old men know their duty
to the college and should need no
urging, but there may be some
new men who have not yet caught

sacriﬁces necessary for conscien-
cious training. On these the fu-
ture of our athletics depend,

That an athlete can be made
by persistently sticking to it has
been well demonstrated by Grin-
nell men. The best athletes this
college has turned out have been
men who did not win a place in
the ﬁrst meet in which they were
entered.

This year new men have excep-
tional advantages. It is not necs
essary to "punch aholern atin
can to make a shower bath." as
did our predecessors, but’ a well-
equipped gymnasium offering the
best facilities for training is at our
service, More than this we have

Chresl‘omathlan. 9

The program of the society last
Saturday evening, with the excep-
tion of its musical numbers, was
rather slow and tedious. Mr.
Way's discussion of recent Alnerir
can art was appreciative, and to a
large extent his criticism was ju-
dicious and original,and his selec-
tions representative, though not
including several of the best
known names; but the subject as-
signed was so large a one that
anything more than the merest
surface treatment demanded more
time than is usually allowed. It
is not to be wondered at then that
the speaker considerably overran
his time The same general criti-
cism may be passed upon'Mr.
Calderwood's talk on recent mu-
nicipal reform. The best paper
of the evening was by Mr:Wils
liams on recent developments in
science.

The program was pleasantly va~
ried by several good musical num-
bers, being opened by a vocal
solo by Miss Atkinson. Miss
Helen Millard and Miss Brace
rendered an instrumental duet and
Miss Williams an instrumental
solo, all the number's being en-
cored.

Mr, F. Meade gave a review of
“Richard Carvel,” conﬁning him-
self more to items of criticism than
to the actual narrative. which he
assumed to be familiar to most of
the audience

The extemporaneous work was
not above the average. The de-

bate was dispensed with.

Phllo~Chresro Debate.

Considerable interest is being
manifested in the coming debate
between the Philomathian society
of the State University and the
Chrestomathian society of Iowa
College. The debate is to beheld
in Grinnell, Saturday March 3i.
and the question to be discussed
is, “Resolved: That the English
claims in the controversy with the
south African Republic prior to
January l, lgoo. are justiﬁable."
The question isa live and vital one.
and the recent events of the war
have brought the issues at stake
boldly before the public. The en-
thusiasm shown by both societies
indicates that their respective
teams will receive heartyco-oper.
ation and support.— Both teams
are working hard, and with the‘ad»
ded incentive ofa well-earned vic-
tory a battle royal is assured.

The Chrestomathian team. comr
posed of Quaite, Dickinson and
McCarty, will support the aFﬁrma-
tive side of the question. The
team was chosen after close come
petition in two preliminary cles
hates, the ﬁrst of which was open
to all members of the society.

The desire tor an intercollegiate
debate, certainly shows a growing
interest in debating and society
work in general. Without in the
least lessening the interest'ln the
Cornell-Grinnelldebate,thisevent
will give a new opponunity for dcs
velopingdebatingmaterial. Aside
from these considerations. though
an intersociety debate and not in
either case representing the whole
student body, we cannot but re-
gard it as another bond which will
bind more closely the friendly
feeling now existing between the
two institutions; and as such it is
to be hoped that it will be made

an annual event.
+

The executive committee of the
board of regents, of lowa City,
have decided to retain Drt Knipe
as director of athletics in the Uni
versity, and he will stay. This
will have a great inﬂuence on the
athletic standard of the University
since Dr. Knipe is well liked by
the students, and will receive the
hearty support of the student
body.

The Chicago Banquet

The Iowa College Alumni As-
sociation of Chicago held it annu»
al banquet last Friday evening at
Hotel Leland. There were pres-
ent about ﬁfty, including quite a
number from out otthe city The
spread was preceded by a halt
hour’s social session during which
the parlors of the Leland buzzed
with echoes of renewed acquaint-
ance. The assembly manifested
all the proverbial enthusiasm of
Grinnell crowds, representatiVes
of the old and new regimes ming-
ling freely and forming the ac~
quaintances which are a valued
feature of all alumni banquets,
The affair was pronounced the
most successful of the kind the
association has ever held. This
was especially true of the post
prandialprogram‘which evidenced
not a littleircareful preparation.
Mri’WJt Pringle, ’85, actEd as

mood:

Possibilities for“Grinnell,” Pres.
George A. Gates.

Space will not permit mention
of all the toasts. much as they de-
serve it. All were especially in»
terested in the remarks of Presi-
dent Gates. Grinnell’s possibili»
ties, he thought, depended very
greatly on the future of education
in general. He: regarded as ex—
tremely silly the claim that state
institutions would eventually dis—
place colleges. The denomina-
tional school offers to its students ,
an inﬂuence, an atmosphere. a
spirit which up to the present, at
least, has never been developed
in a state institution. President
Gates also dwelt at considerable
length on the attitude of the col-
lege toward the chair now vacant
as another matter which might
affect the future of Grinnell, and
expressed the hope that it might
