Penn Passing Combination Almost
Spells Defeat to Grinnell
Football Warriors.

In a ragged defensive game and
marked by listless playing on the part
of both teams, the Pioneers battled
Penn college to a 6-6 tie on Word
field Saturday.

Gl‘illnell opened the scoring early in
the first quarter after an exchange of
punts, and a fifteen yard penalty on
Penn for interfering with the receiver
of a kick had placed the ball on the
Quakers’ thirty yard line’. A pass, Rose
to Fail, was good for eighteen yards,
and on the next play Rose broke
through tackle for eleven yards, Mc-
Intyre added the extra yardage for a
touchdown, but Evahn failed in his
attempt for the extra point.

Shirt with Bush.

The Scarlet and Black eleven start
ing the second quarter with a rush,
marched down the field to Penn’s fif-
teen yard line where they were held
for downs after a fiften yard penalty.
With an exchange of pilots Penn took
the hall in midfield and by 9. series of
passes netted themselves forty—five
yards and a touchdown. The Penn
passing combination Covey to Quire
proved disastrous to the Pioneer de-
fense in this attack.

Coach Sanderson's men, coming
back strong at the beginning of the
third quarter. threatened to score
again after smashing their way to
Grinnell’s fifteen yard line, only to
lose the hall on downs and on unsuc-
cessful try for a field goal.

Melt-tire, Liedike Gain.

Liedtke and Mclntire, both new faces
on the Pioneer eleven, proved them-
selves to be real performers, hoth
running through the Quaker line for
several good gains, and both figuring
conspicuously invthe Grinnell forward
passing attack. Fall, at end, played a
good game, especially on covering
punts, The fact that Covey, elusive
Penn safety man, escaped only once
for a run of more than five yards
showed that the Pioneer wlngmen
were attending strictly to business.
Briggs, Fail’s running mate, playing
his first game, turned in s creditable
exhibition. Captain "Sonny" Davis, at
left tackle, was a tower of strength,
and time after time demonstrated that
old power,which has made him one of
the most feared linemen in the Middle
West. was still there,

The Penn passing combination,
Covey to Qulre almost spelled defeat
to the Pioneers on several occasions,
and was the means of Penn tieing the
score in the second period. Wetland,
rangy Quaker fullback played a good,
hard-smashing game, and gained Pcnn
practically all the yardage that she
made through scrimmage.

Asserts in Chapel Yesterday That
Gﬁnnell Athletics Do Not
Depend 011 Valley.

"Grinnell’s program for the develops

In speaking of the recent homh shell
that broke in athletic circles of Mis-
souri Valley colleges and universities.

future with the cooperation of slur
dents and faculty, Until official ac»
tion was taken by the faculty commit

A ragged scrimmage with the trash

with the yearlings Tuesday attcrnoon
has begun Coach Wattls drive prepar-
ing for the game with Kansas univere
sity Saturday. Little is known of the
warriors from the sunflower state
except that they are big and expeh
icnced.

Grinnell’s chances for winning her
first Missouri Valley game this fall
will depend largely on the experience
gained from scrimmage with the preps
this week. The twenty minute “taste
of blood" Monday was unsatisfactory.
Eleven men seemed to be having in-
dividual encounters with eleven other
men on the gridiron. Tuesday's drill
seemed to il-ml out many of the dire
ficulties, for the varsity scored four or
five touchdowns in the hour of play.

Chullge In 'Center.

A change in the center of the line
seems probable after the unexpected
power shown last evening when Brad-
ley was shifted from center to guard
and Heldridge was assigned the cen—
ter position. Evnhn and McIntyre
showed flashes of their last season's
hall toting when they ripped long
gains off the freshman tackles,

Faculty Solids Letter.

The rollowing letter was sent out
yesterday by the faculty of Grinnell
to the six institutions which withdrew
from the conference. Exclusive rights
to print the article were granted to
the SCARLET AND BLACK and re-
prints may not be made by any press
association or newspaper without per—
mission of this paper. The letter:

September 27, 1927.
My Dear lur, President:

We have read the news reports of
the withdrawal of Ames, Kansas; Ok- '
lahcma, Missouri, Nebraska and the
Kansas Agricultural College from the
Missouri Valley Conference. Now,
three days after the report of the action
was released to the press, official no-
tice has reached us.

Since the ultimate authority over
athletic interests is vested in the fac-
ulties of the members, the Faculty of
Crinnell Collcgc wishes to express to
you, and through you to your faculty,
its conviction/that this summary ac-
tion, tending to disrupt the Missouri
Valley Conference, runs counter to the
established principles of intercollegiate
courtesy and good will. Moreover, it
is a violation of the implicit obligations
which prolonged and friendly official
relations have created,

We of Grinnell are not disturbed by
the action as such. Grinnell has its
own program of Physical Education
which is wholly independent of any
conference relationship whatsoever.
Hence, the action taken by the six in-
stitutions is of little consequence. But
we question sharply and justly the
method adopted in bringing it to pass.
it is out, of harmony with the method
of procedure always to be expected
from college and university officials
who are dealing with intercollegiate
problems of common interest and con-
cern.

For the Faculty of Grinnell College,

Very truly yours,
(Signed)
J. H. T. MAIN.

“The statement that I made
Tuesday morning, find published more
or less correctly in several papers,
covers all that there is to say at the
present regarding the Missouri Valley
upset," said President Main this morn-
ing when interviewed b y a.
SCARLET AND BLACK reporter.
"Gl'inrlell's record in athletics
and physical education for more
than forty years, and the steady pro-
gl'ess We are making [Olvzll'd a definite
realization of new ideals in that di
action are not in the least impaired
by ilie explosion oi this ‘lireurdckel","
he continued.

Injury To Wiilltlruuilig Schools.

“Some illstltutions seem to have been
fairly knocked off their [eetithey say
they are ‘gl'ogg_ '7nud the newspapers
are full of bowls and innuendo laying
the responsibility for this affair on
one university or another. One tiling
is absolutely certain, and it is that
none of the institutions interested will
be injured nearly (ls much as those
who have been fl party it) this secret
move."

lVith regard to Grlnuell’s future in
athletics President Main said that
aside from Allies and Drake the Val—
ley conference contests roused com—
paratively little enthusiasm among
Grinncll students, and that games with
those two institutions would probably
continue to be scheduled regardless of
conference affiliations, leaving oppor—
tunity for Crionell to schedule games
with other colleges and universities
who have asked a place on our sched—
lilo.

Discourtcsy Amazing Feature.

"The discourtesy of the proceeding
is its most amazing feature, as I said
yesterday," President Main affirmed,
"and is In direct conflict with the in-
tercollegiate ethical standards which
