iniccunuuume SIGNS

Last evening the convictions of this Column
were reaffirmed by the speech of Sccretaly
of Commerce Harry Hopkins before the
Des Moines Economics club.

Hopkins fully acknowledged the necessity
for the creation of “confidence" in the busi—
ness world before any sustained and pro-
longed recovely can take place.

"Confidence” has two essential elements;
(1) taking the future for granted, (2) ac-
cepting the present with surenéss of one‘s
ability to cope with problems one meetsi
And it is here that Hopkins fully realizes
the part government has played and can
play in creating “confidence.”

While we can take for granted that gov—
ernment has not meant to destroy business
confidence, nevertheless it is well known
that government has not been particularly
solicitous about Such an ephemeral and sen-
sitive thing as “confidence.” But the point
of last night’s speech is that the chief New
Deal lieutenant fully recognized the part
”confidence” plays in business. and the port
government can play to create confidence.

The Hopkins’ speech was another one of
the accumulating signs-that the nation is
turning from reform to recovery. The roe
cent Fortune and Gallup polls strongly in—

dicate that the people are fully in sympathy
with the reforms, but are now looking for
recovery.

A democratic philosophy of agricultural
control has been establisl ed to help the
farmers. With minor modi ications and imr
provements recovery will come to agricul-
turc with the proper functioning of these
controls.

Business has generally accepted the idea
of collective bargaining, and the essentials
of the Wagner Act. We should get a meas—
ure of indust idl peace which will tend to
hasten recovery.

The government has recently given a
very favorable deal to the utilities in the
purchase of some of the properties of the
Commonwealth alid Southern Corporation
in the Tennessee Valley.

It is obvious that peace is beginning to
come, and capital should soon be flowing
into electrical development. This, too. will
help recovery.

The problems of the railroads are re»
ceiving earnest, sincere, and sympathetic
hearing from the administration. Some re-
covery program will be advanced to aid that
great industry.

Then another additional sign of returning
recovery is the gradual. but nevertheless
persistent, increase in the building industry,

This year should show substantial 1 »
covery gains, and the most important 13 sh
to this recovery is the friendly and soli
ous attitude of government.

GRINNELL-IN-CHINA

What is Grinnell-ineChilio'l That question
has been heard Several times on the campus,
and in view of the coming campaign for
funds from the students for Grinncil-in-
China, it seems logical that students should
know where these funds are going.

Grinnell-in-China is a school ill Techow.
Shantung. China The normal enrollment is
approximately 300. The money sent from
Grinnell helps pay for the buildings and
for scholarships to the Chinese students who
attend the school. _

Since the war in China With Japan, the
school has been having a difficult time,
Considerable damage was done to several
buildings of the school, and, although the
Japanese government re-embursed the
school for some of the damage, there is still
much improvement needed. The enrollment
has dropped, the teaching staff has been
revised and cut down, and the crops in
this area have been consistently poor.

Consequently, the need of a good contri~
bution from the students and faculty of
Grillllell college is even more essential than
ever before, The student representatives of
Grinnell—ineChina will start their campaign
ill a week or so, and it is up to Grinliell
to keep this vital educational institution in
China going.

Lattimore, in maintaining his
belief that China will eventually
win the war, asserted that the naa
tioh has a comparatively bright
outlook for the future.

the war with China, and other
nations with whom China had
treaties did not come to her aid.
the whole network of treaties col-
lapsed/i Lattimorc pomted out,

China has only one enemy to
