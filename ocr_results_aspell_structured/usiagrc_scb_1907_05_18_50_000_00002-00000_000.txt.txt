A Unique Aiiair.

Last night was illitugulated what
itis‘hoped byall will heccrne an an»
nllal allair in lowa College Although
there can scarcely be exactly the
same reeling each )eal‘ as that which
prompted last night‘s demonstration.
Fouuilel's’ (In) is an annual occasion
which i'ully rleserves recognition by
the student body. The spontaneity
and great good feeling which made
last evening's celebration a success
shows conclusively that Iowa College
students would appreciate and turn
io good use all annual “college day."
We have and enjoy several events in
tlleyear which give opportunity ior
an expression oi real ieeliutr on our
part, outlhere is as yet no occasion
(or the aluminium: oi that phase or
Grillnell Sou-it which makes ior the
closer iellowshro and union oi all the
parts oi our school. We neerl one
ereningin each year set apart ulien
ohe whole school may lzthllel' in some
such way aslast niljlit anti show [Dr
nether that we are thankiul for our
membership in lawn College.

The Largest Cullcge.

In View oi the lace that we con-
tinually speak oi our school as a sin-all
oolleee, in is the accepted notion that
there are many schools which outstrip
us in point oi . The fact is a study
oi tile ﬁgures shows that Iowo Col-
lege has the largestactuel attendance
in the iollt- college classes or our school
in the state and oi many institutions
outside the state which are reputetl
as bum; largel- sohoo's OLIlercolleges
have a larger total attendance but it
is riue to the icet that they liit'lude a
nulnlrsr oi secondary departments
whose students are it purl vi the (‘le-
'ther in splili llor ill truth.
