Looking for the Right Stuff

By Terri Porter

Looking to put some or their
“positive chemistry” to work last
Saturday. the Football Team
came up short against Macalaster
with a final score 0130712.

Since Macalester ls new to the
conference this year. the Pioneers
faced a number 01 unknowns
about the caliber of the
Macalester team. Despite the

on .nturday. "They played really

"live never seen a Grinnell foot-

ball team more ready to play
mentally "

Echoing the two major goals the
team made at the beginning or the
season. Martinek stated “We’re
here to field a competitive team
and to won football games.”

Based on the team's perfor-
mance against Macalester. the
Pioneers are well on their way to
realizing their goal to be comv
petitive. Given that this high level
of competitiveness remains cons
tant. and assuming the other
variables fall into place, the team
would seem to have found the
right iorrnula ior achieving their
second goal — winning games!

Among “other variables” is in-

Field Hockey

The Women's Field Hockey
Team was Victorious in their iirst
game of the season, beating the

Kansas City Club team, 1—0.
Although it is not reflected in die
score, Grinnell dominated the
game. Ninety percent or the game
was played on Kansas City's side
of the field.

“We need to be more ag-
gressive.” reflected coach Dee
Fairchild, “Since we spent most
oi the game on the Kansas citi
side, we deserved more goals,”

“There is too much of a time
lapse between when the offense
loses the ball and when the
deiense picks it up.” stated Fair
child.

Martha Clarahan, a freshman
playing the right wing position,
scored the game's only point. She
was assisted by Senior Kathy
Cullen Although there were many
outstanding players. according to
Fairchild. it was a team effort
that produced the victory,

“The team played very well.

The team's next game is tonlor-

Facing what Coach Judy Hunter
termed a “tough St. Ambrose
team," the Women’s Tennis team
dropped their iirst match oi the
season last Friday. 7-2. Although
the score seems somewhat one
sided. Hunter noted that “a

with more than our fair share of
injuries this year." With a squad

lord to have too many players out
at onetime.

A case in point is Rob Lough. a

a “very determined match." and

Hunter stated. "I thought we
had a good eilort. but they were
just stronger than we were "

The team also played Loras at
Dubuque last Saturday. The no

was. "We played pretty well."

The women face their first con-

Illinois against Monmouth and

the meet.” She said. "Last
weekend people realized what
they needed to work on. and now
they're determined to do it.”

Volleyball

By Flora Winitz

Backed by the strong serving of
Kristen Galles. the volleyball
team took a 973 lead in their first
game of the year last Saturday
against Upper lowa University
But, despite the strong start, Grin~
hell was unable to hold the lead
and lost the game 15710.

“It was a letdown emotionally,
The girls played an excellent
game," stated Coach Deb McCarr
ty

Strong deiense and excellent
setting by Elaine Schwartz were
not enough, as the Pioneers were
unable to beat Upper lowa inthe
second and linal game oi the
match. Although Grinnell lost by a

quarterback, who missed the
Macalester game due to a knee in-
jury. Steve Worth. who took over
for Lough. turned in a "solid perr
inrmance." according to Mar
tinek, but Worth isn't used to play-
ing at that position

AS Martinek noted. “For our ol-
iense to iunction optimally, Lough
has to be the quarterback, and

Worth must be the slothack."'

score of 1578, they actually played
better in the second game

In their second match or the
day, Grinnell lost 15-0. 153 against

the University of Wisconsin at .

Platteville.

“They are a much bigger school
and they just overwhelmed us."
McCarty remarked. ”Their Starr
ting six were all taller than our
tallest girl [who is 5’8"]!"

Overall, the team played well.
McCarty was pleased with the
team's periormance e especially
against Upper lowa, Though not
the same team. last year the
volleyball team did not win a
single match.

“I wasn’t quite sure what we '

were capable oi. But the girls
played well. rm proud oi them
They played well deiensively and
made some good passes.” McCar»
ty stated, “The girls have a great
attitude and I’m looking iorward
to the rest oi the season." summr
ed up McCarty.

Soccer

by Flora Winitz _
Heavy rain throughout the soc~
car team's first game increased
the many problems Grinnell had
on the field as the Pioneers last to
the University oi Chicago, on, last
Saturday.» Coach John Pfitsch
stated that one problem the team
had was with the new defense
“We‘ve changed from a manrtor
man delense to a zone delense this
year in order to help the offense,"
he said, and added. ”but in so do,
ing it only worsened the oiiense.
This wasn't intentional. but we
need to truly master the delense
before the offense will work."
Pﬁtsch was somewhat disapr
pointed that the older players did
not make the defense work but
was also pleased with the younger
players‘ performances: "Though

Lough is currently undergoing
rehabilitation. and it‘s ques»
tlonable whether he will be ready
to go against Beloll next Saturn
day.

Another variable is that the
teams remain relatively undecld»

the appropriate combination ol
personnel.“ stated lilar'tinek. He

week and get more organized."
