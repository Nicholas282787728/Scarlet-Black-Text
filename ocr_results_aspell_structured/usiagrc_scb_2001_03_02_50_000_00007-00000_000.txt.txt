Czech Excursion

Skye: OK, so y'all might think that getting up ar7
on a Saturday morning to tour a museum in Cedar
Rapids doesn‘t sound like the best cure for your rcgu.
lar Friday night Harris hangover. But this isn’t ,ust
any museumithis is the National Czech and Slo-
vak Museum, a tribute to Czech and Slovak tradi-
(ions. You never dreamed there could be anything
cool about going to school in a cornﬁeld, but lowa
isn't as unirormly Wonder-Bread as it appears. town
has a rich heritage of Czech culture, and if you’re
interested in learning about it, the Russian and East-
ern European Studies Concentration and the Instruc-
tional Support Committee is sponsoring a trip out
to the museum this weekend. You will also have the
opportunity to experience lunch in a Czech rcstnu-
rant. I don't know about you, but i crave any sort or
ethnic food while I’m here. ContactTodd Armstrong
[arnistton] (that's right, no “g") in the Russian De
partment to reserve yoursearon rhebus and rot more
details. Indulge your sensesilmtn something new.
Czech this one out. (I had to use the pun ,, it was
there tor the taking.)

The Slip and Urban Lovechild at Harris!

tryou read the loint board minutes, maybe you
were as confused as l was about this week‘s concerts
at Harris. I read something about the Jazz Mandolin
Project and almost ilippcd that they were going to
play here, but alas, arrer emailing our wonderrul Con»
certs chair, Hilary Mertaugh, I discovered that the
MP is actually in“ a group orierks that like to can-
cel their concerts on poor liberal arts students. For
tiinatcly another band, The Slip, has come to save
the day! Pei-rorniing with the campus band, Urban
Lovcchild, The Slip will groove the night away with
a "spelunking bass line.“ Any hand that uscs thcword
"spclunking" in their bio must be cool, The music's
hip and they didn‘t stand us upl Go see them Friday
night at 7:00 at Harris.

Eaulconet Gallery next week, Each panel is in retngc
nition ofa life that was lost to the disease, and the

Dallas. Yeah, we tried the whole Lindy bop
thingahopper last semester rot Exco, I had to stop
though because there was this one pcison l danced
with who stunk. That's right, ifyou danced within:
in that class, you might want to give yoursclra little
once over with the sniffer, because it might have been
you! Neil Figuracion is ﬂying all the way in from
LosAngeles not to smell yourstcnch, but to teach us
all some new skills. Neil is a popular DJ and well
known dancer in LA, and his workshop will give the

Picking the year’s

by Joseph Michaels
Guest Writer

There was a lot orralk last year that ﬁlms were simply not or
the same taliber as those in preceding years, and to that I say "true."
While there certainly was a dearth of good, solid Films this year.
there was by no means a complete absence or them. Most orthc
rollowing, especially those at the top ornry list, would have made it
onto the top to lists oralmost anyyear. orcnuise, the year's lack or
competition does severely limit the shape ormy full list and iuany
or the films towards the bottom, while i am quite partial to them,
probably would not have appeared in other years. So, without fute
ther adieu. I give you the best ofzooo.

l. cone/neg ‘l‘tget, Holt/m Drngin. This is a noehruinert From
the word go, lwas captivated by this ﬁlm. Ang Leo's direction pulled
me from the cvcryday world orrenlity into a world orluscious rant
tasy where legendary rightors sail through the air and combat each
other with the agile choreography oran elaborate dance. Lee’s film
is a visual splendor, as beautifully photographed as Thc Thin Red
Line (which in my mind has no equal). with the possible exception
orthe screenpl ty, every ingredient enriches the Film and even error
you leave the theatre, you will ﬁnd Crouching Tiger lingering with
you for days This is more than a him, its .in experience.

2, Reyiiiiiii/oi A Dieeiir ' this it not nicaut as a negative state»
ment at all, but Requiem for a Dream was one ofthe bleakest films
I’ve ever seen. Director Darren Atonofsky balances texture and depth
with visual flair, and elicits first rate performances front his entire
cast, most notably lilleu Bulstyn, The film’s atmosphere is u re-
lenting and until the credit rolls, it stays true to its own premise,
that is ofdrugs destroyinglives in dirrcrcntways and through dilTerr
ent forms.

5. rafftr. Another rlrug movie, almost equally good. Unlike
Requiem's speciric, subjective approach, Traffic often a broad, ohr
iective look at America's drug problem. Although its multifaceted
message about the often rutile war on drugs is about as subtle as a
railing rock, the message is an important one, and i would argue
that Traffic IS one of the more important films America has pro-
duced since Schindler's List. Now, if only Trafﬁc didn’t have that
pesky, uplifting ending to undermine the rest orthe riliu, .

4. Mildetzioyt. Curtis Hanson's sharp, unassuming follow-up
to LA Conﬁdential is made all the more engaging by Michael
Douglas's best petrornrancc in, well, ever. Douglas offers a rrne,
textured performance ofa wliter short on luck and oilt of touch
with himselr. The ﬁlm is not only subtle and engaging but run as
well. Franees McDormand and Robert Downeyjr. contrihute fine
supporting perrormanccs.

the

rection

The "Latin " craze of the late
nineties had the right idea.
There’S something about the
music from our Southern
neighbors that deﬁes the
plasticity of Swedish-made
pop, and Ricky Martin and
embarrassingly—
monikered J-Lo have nudged
pop in a slightly jiggier di-

played. Whispering drums, gentlyringered guitars laid backhorns
and mesmcrizing piano lines dont bltlsrcr. they insinuate. rhis al,
bunt sounds like the Jazz records your grandparents bought when
they got done sowing thcirwild oats. And on “Silencior a magical
duet between Ecrrcr and Omara Portttondo, you get an inkling or
how your parents came into being in the rust place.

Part orwhat gives the Buena vista Social Club their sex appeal is
the age or the playersithey've seen it all, and iryou peer through
the haze orchcap wine and expensive cigars that they create, you
can see it, too. They act as a portal to a

subtler, inorc sensuous rimc. Orishas, a
Cuban hipthop quartet based in France,
speak a younger dialect of the same
tongue, Their latest album, A Le

American music.

somnolent posturing ofmost gangsta rap. these
kids aren't arrard to yell, or to speak in somec
thing other than a monotone. injecting the
sweat into the street party is their producer,
Don d’Niko, who emits a sound which hinges
on slinky piano runs, tight bursts ofhoms, and
laid.back guitars. Everything but the beats is
played live, giving the album an organic reel:
and surprisingly for a hlprhop recording,
orishas go easyon the bass, valuing rhtust over
thump. Spice is supplied by percussionist
Miguel Ange Diaz, whose congas generate sync
copared heat on several tracks. While most or
the music IS tor the dance ﬂoor, a song like
“Madras,” which gets its swerve on with a
plaintive lead vocal mirrored by a lone trume
per, uncovers Orishas’ stcamier side.

5. Billy Elliot. Despite being an exceptionally rormuiaic rilm,
Billy Elliot is quite a treat. Janus Bell shines in the title role ora
young boy yearning to dance. Stephen Daldry’s direction actually
draws attention away rrom the formula used (young boy standing
torwhat he believes in, despite all obstacles), and therilm'sencrgy is
contagious. The script turrets some (orwhat relevance is the back
ground story orthc mincrs’ strike?) and the ending reels a bit tacked
on, but Bell is a revelation,

6. s/i/teroio oft/7e vompttr. This rum is rich with underlying,
black humor that is made all the more appealing by the command»

two hours or this opus are engaging and made even more so by
Ralph ricnncs pcrrormances (he plays three dirrcrentgencrarions or
a Jewish ramily). The historical backdrop is interesting, but it only
works as a backdrop; the personal aspects are much more appealing.
