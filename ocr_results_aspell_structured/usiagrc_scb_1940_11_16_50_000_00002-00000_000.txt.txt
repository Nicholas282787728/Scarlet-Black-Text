0 Horses in Main Hall

The residents of tlle quadrangle are by this
time fairly accustomed to the succession of
exhibits which have adorned the walls of
Main hall corridor. In fact, we know from ex,
pel’ience that it is easy to grow so accustomed
to sailing past them as to forget their exis-
tence altogether. But having heard vaguely
of one Millard Sheets, we made it a point
this time to go the rounds. We are not a
connoisseur, but we approve of Ml: Sheets.
We like his fanciful horses, and we like his
russets and blues and the uncanny way he
makes black be several colors atonce.

We found, however, that for once you
cannot give these pictures a hasty once-over
and make a single comment do for the lot—
as one might well do with the variegated
tapioca-pudding known as surrealism, indeed
with the uniformly drowned-looking water
colors of Alexander Nepote. He was tlle one

before Mr. Sheets, as you may not l'emel‘l‘lr
her. We found that yoll must look at each
picture separately because, aside from the
horses, they are all pretty different. We
also found that there are more pictures in
the drawing room, and that they are equally
worth loolung; at.

The residents of the quadrangle have
no desire to be selfish about the horses in
Main hall. They are going to get around
sooner or later to seeing what they are all
about. Meanwhile we suggest to you ill the
dorms that you bring your date in early one
of these cold nights and have a look your-
self.

Dear Mamie:

Do you remember what I said, in my last
letter about the men at Grinnell, About
how they just don’t have anything? Well,
I take it all back now. They’ve got plenty
they’ve got beards. Of course, that isn't
quite all they’ve got, but that’s the most
noticeable thing right now.

Last week, looking- at a man was just
the same as usual. There was the man, you
looked at him, and nothing happened. This
week things are changed. You look at a
man, and the first thing you see is one of
these wonderful beards. Honestly, it’s so
thrilling, it does something to you inside.

Men used to be sort of minor characters
on this campus. Remember my telling you
about that? Even that is changed now. The
men have at last taken their proper place on
this campus. They have found a ﬁeld ill
which they call excel. They have proved
their ambition, their perseverance, and
their loyalty to Grillnell standards. And
you'd be amazed at the change all this
has made in the girls' attitude. We just
stand around in awe when one of those”
beards comes near.

I wish you could come to visit Grine
nell now. You’d have so much funiyou‘d
really go over big. You could try that line
of yours about ”Oh, you’re so manly,” and
it would really fit ill. That’s what we‘re
all doing now. It’s so wonderful. Write and
tell me if you can come. I‘ve got to go now.
because I have a date with a beard

Love,
Dottie

No YWCA MEETING

The r. w, C. A, will not meet
this week because of the talks bcv
ing given by Miss Osborn, Mary
Alice Beck. president, announced
today.

Some of the present members
of the Councll of House Presi-
dents have, among others, manlr
fested a worthy Interest in the
need for a changc. They have
submlllca, lnfarl-nally, a plan
which must be incorporated in a
new organization of our govern-
ment to the student body.

The prcsldcnl of the Student
Councll is also on record as fa-
vorlllg some kmd of reorgallizzb
tion which will make
government at Grinnell more of
a reality than it has been in the
past, .
The League Board, although not
suppbrung any plan and perhaps
advisedly questioning the need for
any change, has exlllbited no lit-
tle interest in this most vital of
issues.

Another group consisting for teh
most part of students-atvlarge,
have carefully workcd out a plan
[or a new Student Council, They
have presented a chapel program.
They have held a. mass meeting.
They have dlstribllted mimeo-
graphed copies of the proposed
plan among; lhc students. This
group recognizes, as none other
does, the fact that the present
shortcomings of the present scu-

student .

dent government are fourfold; no
adequate rcprcscnlallon of the
student body, poor publlclly, con-
l'llcl. of allthorlty between the var
rious governing groups. and an
apathetic attitude on the part of
the councll toward the most im-
porlanl campus questions such as
the gladmg system, the cut sys
tem, etc.

This group believes, after a
careful canSlderation or all [110-
posals, even after gomg so far as
to compromise with one other
group, which pl-nffcrcd an alleg-
cdly absolute plan and refused a.
compromise, that the student
council must remain an indepenr
dent unitinot a casual combilla~
non of the Council of House Pres-
ldents and the League Board Tlus
group also behaves that the coun-
cll must consist in the future of
a. body of hall and cottage-elect-
ed l-cprcscntallves. Meetlngs must
be publicized. A mechanism must
be created (m fact has beenA‘lt
wul be presented in house meetv
ings Monday l-llght) by whlch a
better coordinatlon will be effect-
ed between the three governing
bodles. Vital issues must be
brought rule the light and dis
cussed; and they Wlll be under u
system of better representation.

This group still does not believe
that its plan is the absolutely
best one. But it docs believe that
the students as a. whole want the
best, and it believes that after a
nnal amng of lhc proposed plan
m house meetings Monday the
student body will have little
doubt as to what type of plan is
most satisfactory to all and for
all.
