Reisner noted that there are “a lot
or men, both gay and straight, who
have strong enough feelings about

them.” He added that society still
lrowns upon the expression of emotion
and affection between men, which is
acceptable between women.

Members of the GCGC pointed out
that-the importance of sex is over-
