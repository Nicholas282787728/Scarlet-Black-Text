Church Offerings Provide
Education Around World

By Jobs: Web!

Have you been Wondering
what happens to the change
you add to the collection plate
in college church?

The offerings, which vary
between $30 and $60 a Sunday,
are handled by the Board of
Religion, which, so far this year
has spent a total of $1471.50.

The largest amount, 3 0,
went into the DP fund on cam-
pus. The Grinnéll-irHChina pro-
gram has been given $250. The
money went to a Chinese mlsv
sion school for educational pure
poses. Although the question of
sending funds to Communist.
held China was a ticklish one,
the Board decided to continue
the practice after receiving lete
ters from missionaries who said
that their schools are still com»
paratlvely free. The contribu-
tion was also considered a tok-
en of United States good will.

Another 5200 went to the

American Friends Service

committee for foreign aid.

The same amount, $200, was

contributed to the Hampton

Exchange program. ,

Grinnell pays the tuition of
$165 for one student at The Ha-
zel Green academy, a school in
the mountains of Kentucky.

In Worcester, Massachusetts, one
of the favorite spots of students at
the College of the Holy Cross is the
Day Room on the campus. They
like the Day Room because it’s a
cheeriul place—full of iriendly
collegiate atmosphere. And when
the gang gathers around, ice-cold
Coca»Cola gets the call. For here, as
