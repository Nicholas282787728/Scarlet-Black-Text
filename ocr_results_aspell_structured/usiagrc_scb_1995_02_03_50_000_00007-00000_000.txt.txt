Despite Grinnell’s “liberalness” skin
color still matters for some Gn'nnellians

HEN I first thought of
Grinnell or of college in
general I imagined a

accept me as a person based on me
and notnii the color ofmy skin. What
I ﬁnd instead is an environment full
of sarcallcd white liberals who arc,
sometimes, lessacccptingofme than
their “ignorant, uneducated and bla»
tantly racist" counterparts. Because
of this and because of my previous
life experience, I had a hard ﬁrst

the city. Although I did not live in
Hyde Park myself, I spent a lot of
time there and most of my friends

sizable population of white people.
Because it was a neighborhood

attended Kenwood lived in Hyde

same ideals and beliefs and I never

expected the same thing once I e“,

supposed to be this amazingly liberal
and tolerant school which welcomes

people from all walks oflife. I actor

COMMENTARYl

remark upon their comment and tell
them how I feel, I am the irrational
one making abig deal out ofnothing.
All of a sudden I am the black girl
with the chip on her shoulder.
I think this attitude is completely
unfair and unwarranted. Ifl was to
say that I think all white people have
no rhythm and can't dance, or some»
thing else stupid like that, I am sure
no one white would let that pass.
Now, since I have had arguments
with people about comments they
have made. they think I have no other
interests oroplnions on anything else
except on matters of race. I am tired
ofbeing treated like] am the residenr
tial expert on African American be-
havxor. Iam tired of being asked why
black people call each other nigger
and why, ithey call each othernigger,
why white people can’t too. I am
tired of people assuming that I like
gangstarap and grew up inthe ghetto.
I am also tired of feeling alien-
ated from the majority ofthe college.
I am treated, by some white people,
like I am from another planet. Iwas
miserable my first semester here be»
cause I was totally unused to this.
Mostofmy bestfriends are white and
I was amazed to find that my color
was made into such a big deal here at
Grinnell. Iam not saying that every
white personIhavemethereisracist.
I am not trying to make any kind of
sweeping generalizations. I just be-
lieve some Grinnelliarls are not as
“liberal" as they claim to be.

Are Republican Changes in
Congress really for the better?

By HOWARD HORN
News Editor

ANY people like to comment that it doesn’t make a difference
M who controls Congress; nothing really changes, The bureau-
cracy runs everything. Congress is controlled by special

interests anyway. I do not believe this to be true.

Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York until he was
voted out in the November 1993 election, liked to point out that since the
election, the days had been getting shorter. Fortunately, this was a
temporary condition. The days have been getting longer recently, and
experts predict this trend should last until mid June.

Although the shortening of days is one trend that was not sustained
after the landslide Republican victory, several subtle but lasting changes
have taken place in America due to the Republicans controlling both
houses of Congress for the first time since Ike was president.

Ofcourse, it is too early tojudge the effects of the legislation passed
by the Republicanecontrolled Congress. We are still waiting to see what
shape the “Contract with America" will take after it is debated and
compromises are made. The major change noticeable in America today
involves the new topics in political
rhetoric that were not discussed just
a few months ago. Much ofthe new

 

 

rhetoric originated from the New
Speakerofthe House Nethingrich.

in orphanages. (Along this same .
line of reasoning, It is considered [78017161811128

okay to propose grand ideas for leg—
islatjon without working out the economic feasibility of the legislation.)

Rather titan get dings done, it is considered okay to make rules and laws
that will “force" you to get things done. For examples of this, see the balanced
budget amendment. and the mle applying hiring laws to Congress.

It is okay if Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell consider you an ally.

Calling a political adversary a “bitch" or a “fag" is acceptable, provided
it is done in private. If the public ﬁnds out about it, it is the fault of the press.

Ronald Reagan was one of our greatest presidents, Jimmy Carter is
a bad poet. Bill Clinton is (take your pick) a McGovernick, a Communist
or 2i Republican wanna-be.

Schools should not teach children about gay men and women Why
would Americans want to teach their children something that goes against
their interpretation of the Bible?

Criticizing Republicans in Congress is wrong. Criticizing Demo-
crats in Congress is a sport,

Hiring a woman who believes that Nazi and Ku Klux Klan philosophies
should be taught in school is not okay. but remaining friends with her is ﬁne.

The “P" in PBS should really stand for “Private."

Rush Limbaugh. who believes that what is Rtght is more important
than what is true, deserves to be an honorary member of the House of
Representatives.

The United Nations. the international diplomatic organization which
is still dominated by U.S. policies and the darling of President George
Bush during the Gulf War, is working against the interest of American
isolationism, America should withdraw its membership

Ifyou have used drugs in the past, you obviously sympathize with the
“hippie" movement of the 19605 and ’705. The exception to this rule is
Newt Gingrich, who admitted to experimenting with drugs but is no
hippie sympathizer. (Using this reasoning, it is also permissible to use
rumor as fact when it supports your argument.)

These are the preliminary changes that have taken place since the
Republican victories in November. Legislation and more rhetoric is due
soon. In the election, middle and lower class white males were believed
to have provided the “swing votes," or the votes that provided many
republicans the margin of victory. These men asked for change. The
question is: is this the change that they really wanted?
