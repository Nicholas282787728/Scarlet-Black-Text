GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

am Is Planned

M. & St. L. Has
Found A Friend

On the Faculty
By Catherine Funk

Those early dawn trains which
have been waking Grinnell stu—
dents for generations have fina1~
ly found a friend.

To Kenneth Simmons, new band
director, Grinnell is a workshop
(or his hobby of model train
building. Trains passing the cam-
pus are being nsed by Simmons
as rcferenccs for a new model
railroad layout now being planned,
Plans System.

Two years’ work may go into
the completed project, which will
include not only locomotive and
cars, but electrical controls and a
detailed diorama, or landscape,
for the system,

Some Ci-innell student interest-
ed in the hobby may Join Sim-
mons in the project and use a spe-
cial workroom now being prepared
in the Simmons home. “I haven't
worked on a model for some time
and am anxious to start again,"
Simmons said, “Anyone in Grin-
nell who wants to build model
trains is welcome to Join me."

Interested in trains since child-
hood. Simmons has helped to
build six complete layouts.

A real model “builder," he
constructs his equipment from
purchased model parts, doing the
assembling and finishing himself.
Cost of a, locomotive thus assemr
bled is about 530. Completed mod.
els purchased from any of the
ten professional model building
companies in the country. retail
at about $150, he said.

Uses Two Operators,

These models are not “toy”
trains. They are minute but ex-
act reproductions of real equip-
ment. Complete electric control,
with two men operating at central.
SWICChboard, was included in one
layout on which Simmons worked
in Milwaukee several years ago.

In the group working on that
layout were a pharmacist, to ci-
gar salesman, a paint store own—
er, the loading heart specialist of
Jackson cllnlc in Milwaukee, and
a city garbage collector.

Model on Tuesdays

“But every Tuesday night for
two years we were just a bunch
of model builders," Simmons Come
merited,

The last decade has seen the
rise of model building as aleading-
hobby, according to Simmons. A.
so-called "depression-hobby,” mod-
el building was given impetus by
discouraged business men who
tumed to it as an escape from fi—
nancial worries.

Creates Industry.

Since that time two profitable
industries have come out of the
hobby. There are now ten coin.
psnies in the country which man-
IuIacture, exclusively, model equip.
ment for builders. Since 1931 the
craft has had its own publication,
“The Model Railroader," a month-
ly magazine with a circulation of
10,000.

Begun in the early years of the
depression, the publication was
originated by an impoverished
model builder and has since he-
come the “bible" of amateur train
builders ail over the country, ac<
cording to Simmons. '
