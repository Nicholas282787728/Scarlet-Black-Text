lation voted; 742 ballots were cast. Stu-
dent reaction to the election was mixed.

“The statements ottntent weren't very
original in the sense that they were more
or less alike." Syed Faisal ‘99 said. “Most
of the candidates lacked a VISIOI'L I think
Icaders should be dynamic, taking respon-
sibility and getting things done."

“I don’t like all the propaganda because
it doesn't say anything about the candiv
dates," Leah Ray ‘00 said, “I want solu-
tions, damn it."

“The elections seem pretty meaning
less."Andl'ew Towncsmlth ‘99 added. “I
don’t know that much will happen regard
less of who is elected,”

Other students viewed the elections
positively. “1 think the elections were
fairly run," Katherine Nydam ‘00 said.
“Some students complained about the
candidates' lack of originality, but they
didn't take the time to investigate the cane
didates themselves, This apathy ls deplore
able at a college that is supposed to be as
socially concerned as Grinnell."

Sonic student discontent is with the
actual government positions, and trot With
the elections themselves “The prcstdency
seems to be just :1 bureaucratic position
rather than one which ncccssitatcs char

vismzltlc leadership," Mike Redfern ‘97

said.

President Ferguson refuses to reinstate IV CF
Statement elicits mixed reactions from Grinnellians

BY ANDY BROOKS
Special to the Scarlet & Black

In a meeting last Friday, President
Pamela Ferguson denied Grinnclrs
Intei'Varsity Christian Fellowship reinv
statement as an official Collcgc organir
zation. Tire College reiterated its stance
in response to an appeal from the
InterVarsity group requesting ofﬁcial reer
ognition as a student group.

The group’s ofﬁcial status was revoked
in November after one of its lcaders told
administration members that a homo-
sexual could not assume a leadership po-
silion,

In January, lnterVarsity leaders wrote

to Ferguson in an attempt to clarify their
position on homosexuals attaining leadr
ership positions The leaders wrote: "We
do not discriminate in our leadership 53,
lection on the basis of sexual orientation,
but rather on the basis of belief. ... Some-
one who is a homosexual, but agrees with
our interpretation of the scripture, might
well be invtted to lead in the group."

In an official statement issued last Fri-
day, the administration concluded that the
group’s revised criteria for leadership is
still in violatloli of the College's nondis-
crimination policy. The statement read, in
part: “Homosexuals cannot serve as
Intcharsity leaders Without giving up
their identity.“

Erin Shoulberg ‘97, a member of the
president’s Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Task Forcc, said site is pleased with the
college's deClsion.

“It was a very hard decision for the
president," Shoulberg said, “and I think
that it‘s ajust decision. She made it clear
that intolerance of any kind would not be
supported by this college."

Ali Borger ‘99, Chris Pallas ‘98, and
Chris Jennings ‘98, members of the
InterVarsity group, said they feel the
college's decision is intolerant of their
religious beliefs.

“When I think about the freedoms of
association and speech, I can’t help but
feel that the College has violated those

rights, and has shown a lack oflntegrity,
Borgcr said. Speaking to the issue of di—
versity at Grinnell College, the three
Inteerirsity members agreed that the
group should be part of a Grinnell cdur
cation.

“When I go into the world, I‘ll need
to know how to love and be with differ»
ent people, We want to be here to love
and serve the campus as best we can,”
Berger said.

According to Pallas, InterVarsity Re-
gional Director Terry Erickson has sug»
gested that the group ﬁle a lawsuit against
the college for revoking its recognition.

Theatre Department to present Marlowe play

BY PHOEBE SILAG
Staff Writer

The Grinnell Collcgc Theatre Depart-
ment wtll present The Tragiml His/01y
aft/IE Life and Death of Doctor Faurtlt:
by Christopher Marlowe tonight, Saturn
day and Sunday. Performances are at 8
pm. at Roberts Theatre. Admission is
free, Director A. S. Moffett has been
working with thc play‘s 30 cast members
Since January 21.

“It’s on my list of plays that i
choose from when I decide what to
direct next," Moffett said. “We try to
be representative ofdiffcrcnt periods
anti authors, and we do a play from
the Elizabethan period every other
year, It's usually Shakespeare, but
it’s important to do authors other than
Shakespeare. It (Dr. Fauslus) is a play
I have always liked, I was in it 35
years ago. and I’ve wanted to direct
it ever since ”

Because Grinnell has two versions
ol'tlie play, Mol'fctt worked with both
to develop the version that will he
performed this weekend,

“There's an A text and 2t B text, and
there is a lot ofcontroversy about which
contains most Marlowe," Moffett said,
“Both were probably tampered with by
other pcoplc. We're doing all of the A
text aiid including a i‘cw hues and
scenes from the B text,

“Deciding on the text was in inn
tcl'csiing process,” he continued.
“You don't want to get to caught up
iii the scholarship. but on the othct
hand, you don't want to blow it off.
One of the problems was deciding
what to put on stage.

“The play itself is the story of
Faustus and his bargain with
Mcphistopliilis. Faustiis gives up his
soul for 24 years so that he can get
whatever he wants," Moffett said.

tilts play. my character especially."

recall your own experiences to help you

comparative to selling your soul to the
devil. It's difficult to explore what it is
Faustus would have felt or what he

Mochtt said “Kevin Rich ts really rc-
markablc in what he is doing,"

to a male actor.

males or by females," Moffctt said.

actor for the role.”

some cross-casting when I auditioned,
and I was really interested in the pztri,"
