_ urns and tastes

Tiara are many different ways
of cutting tobacco.

A long time ago, it used to be
cut on what was known as a
Pease Cutter, but this dark-
ened the tobacco, and it was
not uniform.

The cutters today are the
most improved, modem, lip-to-
the—mirlute type. They cut uni-
formly, and cut in long shreds.

The tobacco in Chesterfield
is cut right—you can judge for
yourself how Chesterfields burn
and how they taste.
