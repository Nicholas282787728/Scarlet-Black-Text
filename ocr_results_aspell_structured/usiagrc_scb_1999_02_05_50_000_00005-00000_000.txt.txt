. expected,” according'io

Cooper, O’Connell set school records in

pole vault at 6’6”

Approaching last weekend's in-
door tmck meet at Central College,
Coach Evelyn Freeman did not
have high expectations consider-
ing the team had trained only one
week.

"We didn't get terriﬁc perfor-
nianccs. but they werebetter than
lexpected,“ she said.

The Grinnell College women‘s
indoor track team competed
against Centml,GrIlceland,William
Penn, and Cornell in a non-scor-
ing meet last Saturday.

Freenizm brought a small squad
to the meet because, "A lot of

people just didn‘t feel like they
were ready to compete.“

According to the coach, “Most
of the runners that did run were
new to the program and wanted
to get their feet wet.“

First year Melanie Schettler ﬁn-
ished fourth in the 55 meters,
While Nicole Cueno placed second
in the 1500,followed by her team-
mate Sarah Baker Who took fourth.
Freeman creditednew-comerjuli'e
Grundman with running Well in
both the 800 and 1 500 meter races.

'vaeran pole vaulters ldelle Coo

per and Meghan O‘Connell both

cleared 6'6“ at the meet, good
enough to set a new school record.

'The results of the meet. provide
us with a little more information.
You try something new to see what
works and what doesn't, and this
was the perfect meet to do tha
said coach Freeman.

She hopes to get more training
in this week in the technical
events, including the long jump,
high jump, and hurdles.The Pio-
neers will then travel to Cornell
College on Saturday to compete in
the Hilltop Open. .

"Even though we won, in gel}
eral We had a disappointing per-
formance," said Coach Erin Hurley.
“The team initially seemed tinfo-
cusetl anti mentally unprepared.
Fortunately we were able to adjust,
but u e need to be sharper with the
conference championships less
than three weeks away."

The coach did praise the per-
formance of Kerstin Wolf and

Carmen Steward in the 1,000.Wol.f

of 11:23.9l,while Steward placed

onds off of the school record and
we haven’t even begun to taper.
Carmen just had a great swim,“
commented Hurley.

Groves, Mattie Johnson, and
Theresa Hahn, Mohl placcd ﬁrst in
the mo and 200 ﬂy and the 200

' When the Grinnell College
women’s swim team takes on Loras
on the road this Saturday, it will be
the Pioneers’ last formal competi-
tion before the Midwest Confer-
ence Championships,

"Loras will be an important
meet for us in that it will be the
last opportunity for some of the
women to make the conference
championship squath also Will be
a chance for others to swim differ-
ent events than they usually do,"
said Hurley.
