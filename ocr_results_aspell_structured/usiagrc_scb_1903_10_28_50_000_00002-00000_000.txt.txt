HERE areagoodly number
at Iowa College people
who are keeping on ﬁle all copies
of SCARLET AND BLACK that come
to them. For the beneﬁt of such
as tirey and tor the consideration
of others, SCARLET nix-o BLACK
wishes to announce that at the
end of the college year the whole
volume will be indexed in a
form suitable to bind with
the papers. Such ﬁles as have
been kept heretofore make an
attractive volume of matter, in
teresting to all college students.
The binding may be done Iora
small amount, probably not ex-
seeding a dollar. The index
which will be compiled will serve
the double purpose or rendering
the nutter more accessible and
more interesting. The words of
Aliens to his loyal followers have
a bearing on college students:
Farm/t cl 1mm ali/u
int/obit. It inlay some day be as
pleasing to us to have l'ernemberr
ed the incidents and adventures
of our college (lays as it was to
Troirn heroes when they recalled
in old age their tor-trier deeds
and sufferings. SCARLET .\r\'n
BLAC' will help keep them in
mind if it is preserved and bound.
a" HERE are two kinds ot de-
) teat which dirrer trom each
other as much as defeat itself is
different from victory. One kind
is the result of lack of effort and
the other comes in spite of effmt.
iowa College has just suffered a
defeat of the kind that carries
with it nothing but honor. No
etiorts were spared to will the vic-
tory but an unkind latellas denied
us any reward save that which
comes with discipline. Far from
being chagrined attire disappoint-
ment, Iowa College is proud of its
team. A hard ﬁght lost is better
than an easy victory. The stands
made by the 'eam at different
stages otihe Iowa game aresureiy
enough to give encouragement.
No team that plays ball as ours
did last Saturdéy will ever be
called a failure in Grinnellt
