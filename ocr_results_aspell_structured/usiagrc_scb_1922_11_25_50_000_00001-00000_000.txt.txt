Endeavors to Separate the Valid
Elements of Pragmatism
from the Invalid.

SAYS THAT PRAGMATISM
IS NOT TRUE RELIGION

Its Positive Value Is That it Is
a. Rule for Action and Not
for Speculation.

Having presented the elements of
P1agmntism in his lecture on Mon-
day. Prof. William Ernest Hocking.

Henard Exchange professor, endemicl

cred to separate the valid elements
of P1ag1natisn1 from the invalid 1n
his chapel lecture. Thursday morn,
ing.

The three tests of truth, namely,
verficstion, harmony and utility,
which the pragmatists lay down are
different in character although they
appear to be the same ,acco1ding. to
Plofessor Hock1ng. Verification con-
flicts with utility in that the least
verification may outweigh the the
greatest amount of utility and the 1111-
mer is a logical process while the lat—
te1 may be a prefeience

In answering the hypothetical ques-
tion, "Should the two be brought into
the same neldt", Professor Hocking
presented the‘ process of scientiﬁc
idea-making. in contrast to the
Pragmatic belief that intellect and all
thoughts are directed toward action,
science tries to set up signs which
are indifferent to action. Things
should be defined independent of our
interests and purposes, be send ,as the
thing is 'prior and independent of its
qualities. A.thirig is a locus of pos-
sible values but theie is no corresA
pondence between a thing and its
values. Thus the answer of the
question would seem to be in the
negative

With this point established Pro—
fessor Hocking turned to the process
of religious idea making His treats
ment of this point was an effort to
answer the question, "Is the idea of
God a hypothesis taken because of

of its utility or is it like a thing, in-
dependent of our wishes, of positive

or negative value, but whose impor-
tance _‘depends on being independent
of our desires?" The common belief
has been that God is static middle
term rather than a belief that our
ideals can he realized. If the exis'
tence of God is made at separate fact
God may become terrible to the world.
The fact that some people interpret
'God in the wrong way and in this
way obscure humanity has led one
writer to the belief that with the dis—
appearance of God loyalty will he
directed among men.

Plofessol Hocking smted that _he
could not accept this conclusion al-
Lhough he did believe that there has
been a negative result in the old in-
trepretation of God by some people.
The Pragmatic view holds that God
ﬁrst exists and then has value.

Religion may also he viewed from
the pcotic as opposed to the literal
standpoint, Professor Hocking said,
and in this connection he pornted out

the controversy over the Virgin hil‘Lh‘
which some have tried to make a phy— ‘

siological doctrine when it is more
likely a. piece of oriental imagery
Jesus stopped at the turning point of
imagery and reality according to the
speaker. The development of re-

ligion has been flow the magmatic.

Spirit of religion because the spirit

fessoxl Hocking. The best religion is
the one which is most real.

Experience Gained This Season
Should Be Invaluable in
Building 1923 Team.

(By Roy intro).

“The 1922 football season is dead,
long live that of 1923" We cannot
however thus summul'ily’dismlss the
memories of the past Pioneer cam-
poign on the gridiron. Perhaps we
may learn some valuable lessons from
the experiences of not only this year

but the few years also which preceed— ‘

ed it.
Football author-

one development has stood out above
all others in mid»\vestel'n football dur-
ing the last four or ﬁve years, and

that improvement has been in thc[

building up of f‘ru‘ more highly trained
and efficient teams. The weary of
football hits been more and more Cm-
phnsized with the result that the
teams which Grinllcll has met (1“
the past few years have been highly
trained units wh1cb, taken man for
min], were no better fllz‘tnstllc Pioneers,
but as a. unite were more systematic in
their methods of attack. This natur-
ally brings up the question of why
Grinncll has not. also liept pace with
the times (Ind (ll'illlili llel‘ teams in
the mechanics of the game. The 1D-
swel is simple. The f1cqucut chang—

=1ug of coaches 1ecently has not given

any opportunity for the building up
of a system which can stand the test.
it tool: Howard Jones of lowa eight
ycars to build his cba111pfonslup11awk-
cye eleven. Elly at Cue, Finger at cor—
gall. Solcm at Drake, are all almost
historic characters in the schools 111
which they are employed. it stands
to reason that 111 this age of system,
Grinnell can only hope for consistent
success by developing one system of
coaching which will not be constantly
changed from yeztr to year. Coach
Elward this year has shown that he
has a keen insight into the game, and
there seems no reason why he should
not be- able to develop better teams
as he stays with us longer and gets
his system more ﬁrmly grounded in
both older men and‘the new freshmen
teams as they enter Grinuéll. This
is in no way an excuse or an alibi
for the games which we lost this year.
It is a simple statement of fact on
which hopes of future success in Pion-
cer football rests.

Beginning with a new coach this
year, Grinnell has acquitted herself
in a very credible manner and several
worthy achievements have been at-
tained. The most important of these
was the winning of our ﬁrst Missouri
Valley game from Washington. Next
was the score which the Pioneers ran
up against St. Louis University, the
score’ot Notrc Dame against the
same team a week before. Then the
Pioneers should be justly proud of
the light which they put up against
Ames when they only lost an appar—
ent victory by a break of the game.
Parsons was the third school to bow
to the Pioneer attack.

Against Missouri, Ames, Coe, Cor-
hell, and Drake the Scarlet and Black
were not: so successful, but in none of
these games did their opponents suc-
ceed in running up a la'rgo score a-
gaillst the Pioneers. and especially in
the Ames and Cornell games the mar—
gins by which they were beaten were
decidedly slim. In fact, when the total
of all scores of the year is compiled
it is found that the opponents of Grille
nell only scored thirteen more points
than did the Pioneers, the totals be-

_ing as follows: Gi‘innell 56, opponents

69.
Optimism however, is still the [ire

‘vailiug spirit in the Grinnell football

comp and already promising plans
are being formulated for the next year.
llugh Nichols, veteran guard for two
seasons, was elected as captain for

step in the right direction for a. suc—

Is Graduate—-~ of Gnnnell and a
Member of Dramatic and
Men’s Glee Clubs.

Philip Manuel, lyrrc tenor of espec-
ial interest to Grinnell people, will
appear in a recital here December 15.
His accompanist is Gavin Williamson.
The art of these two young men is
unusual because of the fact that, after
years of work, perfect ensemble has
been secured between singer and ac-
companist. The Manuel voice is a
lyric tenor and the Williamson ae-
eompanfments blend excellently with
the voice.

Mr. Manuel, who graduated from
the Griuncll College School of Music
in 1913, was one of the most musical
students Gl‘innell has ever had. After
his graduation he spent two years
studying in Vienna and London. Dur-
ing the war he entered the army and
since then has stayed out of public
life and has spent his time studying
in Chicago. while in college he was
a member of the Dramatic Club and
soloist in the Maps Glee Club.

Gavin Williamson has just recently
returned from a tour in California
with Jessie Christian.

Stage all Set for
Y. M.-Y. W. Carnival,
Men’s Gym Tonight

The A. erollege Cfllnival sponsored
by the ' . M. and Y. w. C. A‘s. will be
held this evening at 7:30 in the
Men's Gymnasium.

Stunts, side shows, fortune telling,
refreshments and free attractions Will
feature the eVenjng. The free attrac-
tions have not been announced but
plans have been made to provide con-
tinual entertainment for all. There are
to be plenty of fortune telling booths
and mole than one refreshment stand,
so delay lln passing from one diver-
sion to another can be avoided.

The post office will be one of the
big attractions of the program. All
are asked to Write letters to some
friend and address and stamp
them. Special delivery letters
may also be mailed to those
present. In this connection there
is to be a dead letter office and peo-
ple may call for undelivered mail
there.

No charges over ﬁve cents will be
made.

The social committees of the Y. M.
and Y. W. C. A_s hztve cooperated in
the planning or the Carnival. Florence
Grover and Earl Burch are the chair-
men in charge of the entire program.
They are being assisted by both cnhi-
llcts and all members. Those serving
on the committees are, Eloise Loomis,
Isabelle Lemon, Esther Gl‘ccn, Rtlhl’
Neil, Grace Hudson, Louise Moyle,

the team will suffer through the

football team which should once again
take its place among the leaders of

“1 am not pes mistic over this
inel‘iod of reconstruction after the war
when I consider it in the light of the
|long periods of reconstruction. after
:other wars," said Sir Basil Thomson
in Herrick Chapel last night. Sir
Basil was formerly head of the British
Secret Se me and Criminal investi-
gation Department, and spoke on the
subject of his experiences at Scotland
You], which is the headquarters of
the department. “No, i think that I
would consider myself an optimist,"
he went on to say, "for we are pro—
gressing very rapidly." The noted
criminoligist sees great danger in
such counter-bolsbevik movemenm as
the Facistl in Italy, the lsu Klux Klan
' in the United States and similar move-
ments in Czechoslovakia and Ger—
many, because. however worthy their
aims. they are contrary to law and
order and are bound to get beyond
control: "I believe." be said, "that
we shall have radical agitations and
riots before very long in reaction to
such movements as these.” At such
a time he said that the uncontrolled
sale of guns in America was a menace
to 0“! peace and safety. These were
the important points and prophetic
utterances of tbe speaker last night
Sir Basil divided his services at the
,Yord into thlee periods, the pro—war
period, when his citict duties were the
protection of the ministry. and of for-
eign royalty, and the quelling of sub-
versive movements, the most impel:
taut of which was the suffragette
movement; the war period when his
work was in connection with the Ger-
man spy menace; and the period after
'the war. when. as head of the Intel-
ligencc for England, subversive move-
ments were again his center of in-
terest. During this period Sir Basil
stated that he had means of infor-
mation in every country including the .
United Smtes
1 Gem-1111 Spies Tltrottlod.
Knowledge of the Ger-man spy merr
ace was secured some time p1evious
to the catastrophe at Seraievo. accord—
ing to the lecturer, but the informa-
ticn was not acted upon until the
morning the ultimatum was sent to
Germany at which time twenty seven
of the twenty— eight spies in England
were seized. owing to this loss of
their source of information, the Ger—
mans were unable to get news of the
sailing dates of the English convoys
and of their route across the channel.
At the beginning of a war, .Sil' Basil
says that good intelligence is worth
more than army corps. Starting the
war with the worst Intelligence in
Europe, the British probably ended
\with the best,
1 in discussing the American Intel—
ligencc Service which was veiy close-
ly connected with the British. Sir
Basil belicvcs that they learned all
they could get from England and then
improved on it in some respects.
American police do not compare so
favorably with the British force, bow—
‘evcr. and in contrasting the New York
[police force with that of London, he
called attention to the small number

lavoilable for active service; to the ins

‘efficieut American method of band—
ling crimes; to the menace to the
safety of the state in the uncontrolled
handling ot guns; and to the pos-
sibililies of evading the law on ap-
peals ﬂirough technicalities. _

t Returning to the subject of Ger-
man spies, Sir‘thsil divided them in-
to two classes, patriotic spies like
C(Lrl LOGS, and hired Spies who in
general represented the lowest level
of human depravity. Death is the
penalty, but unly eleven spies were
executed in England owing to the in-
lervnntion of foreign governments in
behalf of the spies who were of their-
country. Third degree methods were
