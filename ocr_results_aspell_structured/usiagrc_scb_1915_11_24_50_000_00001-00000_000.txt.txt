Cornell olicrcd stiii Opposition.

The Drake game stands out as a
feature or the season because 01 the
l‘ecord»breaking score piled up against
the Bulldogs in the stadium, while the
Cornell game was undoubtedly the
hardest battle to win. Not that Finger
had an aggregation nearly equal to
the visiting team, because the ball was
in Cornell’s territory during the en-
tire game, but the muddy field and the
heavy line oi Grihnell’s opponents
made the play {or slower and less
brilliant than would have existed with
a. dry lield. End runs and open iield
work was nearly impossible.

Out or the saw games oi the Grin-
nell season the Scarlet machine has
totaled 146 points to their opponents’
58, as many as Gr-innell piled up
against Drake alone. This record av—
erages a point {or every 2.8 minutes
