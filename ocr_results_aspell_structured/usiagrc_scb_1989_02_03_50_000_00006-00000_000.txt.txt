College standards for a fat linem

Visual communications system guidelines

by Healher Terrence

Most students probably lake
little notice of the Grinnell
College visual»communications
system, To the average person,
the "strong, contemporary band
graphic [a fat line] incorporating
the laurel leaf [or mating slugs]
and a classic, designed type style
[letters]" is nothing more than
the logo. In fact, it IS the logo.
Two years ago, Grinnell College
spent approximately $40,000 to
change the logo from stylized
com to mating slugs.

However, in his introduction
to Identification System
Standards, a book that
meticulously outlines the
guidelines for using the logo,
President George Drake states
that the fat line. slugs, and letters
promote “standards of high
quality in a contemporary world."
I picked up a copy of the book
and discovered (in almost 30
pages) that logoelovcrs cannot

slugs, and letters.

The book. provided by the
Office of Public Relations,
outlines extensively the
standards, applications, and
reproducible materials pertinent
to the new visual-
communications system.
However, lhc average Grinnellian
need only know a few key guide-
lines.

First, the signature (the fat
line, slugs, and letters) may not
be altered in any way. The only
type styles to be used are Times
Roman Condensed and Helvetica
Black, I-Ielvetica Medium,
Helvetica Regular, and Helvetica
Light. The size of the strong,
contemporary band graphic (fat
line) should not be changed and
the logo may never be printed
vertically or diagonally. The
only colors in which the logo
may be reproduced are Grinnell

colors shown in Identification

used when the logo or single-

something like cuff links. The
Old logo, the Stylized Corn (which
the administration insists is
actually two laurel leaves), Is
now the unofficial seal. It may
only appear in black. white,
silver, or gold.

The book also outlines the
proper letterhead for stationery,
along with guidelines for
margins. It explains not only the
proper use of the visual-
eommunications system on
interofficc memoranda, but also
what types of things to include in
the memo and the approximate
length it should be. A special
pull-out section suggests
uniforms which various sports
may wish to adopt. The general
consensus among athletes and
other students is that the
uniforms would be unacceptable.
In fact, Grinnell College students
tired of the Pioneer nickname
could petition to change the name
to the Grinnell College Fighting
Letterheads.

In addition, ldzntzfication
System Standards sets the
guidelines for attaching the
Grinnell College logo to a car
door. Students wishing to affix
the signature on their car must
have a Grinnell College Scarlet
band and Grinnell College Gray
type if the car is light and a white
band and type if the car is as dark
or darker than Grinnell College
Gray. The visual-com-
munications standard must appear
on both the passenger and driver
front door.

A section of the book is
dedicated to outlining the
appropriate style and size in
which campus signs should
appear. The style guidelines are
meticulously met on the campus,
but the sizes are neilher standard
from sign to sign nor consistent
with the guidelines. A
measurement of the Carnegie
Hall sign, the Goodnow Hall
sign, and the Forum sign proved
that college suggestions were not

met when constructing the signs.

Students interested in more
specifies should contact the
Office of Public Relations for a
copy of ldcnttfication System
Standards. However, all students
and faculty should be aware of the
many violations of the guidelines
that exist on campus. A North
Campus resident has a
needlepoint hanging picturing the
unofficial seal that is done en-
tirely in red, a blatant violation
of the color guidelines. A
Younker Hall woman recently
exhibited a Teshirt which pictures
the strong, contemporary band
graphic in red and the lettering in
black, another color mis-
demeanor. Furthermore. a three-
quarters-inch logo appears on
golfballs in the bookstore. The
minimum size of the logo is
indicated at one-anda-hnlf inches.
It was also discovered that logos
on some shirts will fade to a
lighter shade than Grinnell
College Gray if washed reg-

ularily.

In a phone interview, George
Drake asserted that the “mating
slug'I shirts available in the
bookstore were not violating the
logo usage and that he is “glad
we can have a sense of humor
about it [the logo]." Richard
Ridgway, director of Public
Relations, said that individuals
violating the standards will be
asked to conform to the
guidelines.

I must admit that the only
apprehension I had about
attending Grinnell was the lack of
strong. contemporary band
graphic, laurel leaf, and a classic,
designed type style. Now I,
along with many other
Grinnellians, am completely
satisﬁed with the college’s image
and policies. For the
nonconforrnist, I offer one piece
of advice: If you must alter the
visual~communications system,
don‘t get caught. -
