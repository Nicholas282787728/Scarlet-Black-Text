Amid the aftermath of Hurt
ricane Katrina, Grinnell students
should be commended for niohiliz»
ing an impressive relief effort. At
this point, our greatest challenge
remains sustaining this passion for
not just the coming weeks, but for
many years ahead,

While the power brokers in
DC. may not have provided much
relief to the victims, Grinnellians
have broken out of their cornﬁeld
bubble with an outpouring of sup
port.

Starting from a small cluster
of roughly 20 students, the effort
quickly gained momentum as cam—

The goal for the first week was to
collect 5500. The total collected after
the first day alone was over 31,100.
Tabling outside orthe dining halls on
Monday and Tuesday raised nearly
$2,000. The food and clothing drive
at the post office also helped meet a
dire need.

This local effort has taken place
across the country. By Tuesday, do-
nations for Hurricane Katrina had
far excccded the first week efforts to
help victims of the
Asian tsunami and
the 9/11 terrorist
attacks.

However, many
experts predict
that outrageously
high gas prices and
a sputtering economy will put the
brakes on a prolonged relief effort.

Creating a stronger newspaper

Dear Readers,

[Ir/11‘ after/it via/rims. “ ~Glzgaly Kane,

For the first time in the four years
I have been at Grinnell, the Star/ct
ens/ate has a largely new editorial
staff and thus, the opportunity to
reinvent itself.

In an age of mounting media
distrust, we feel that it is our rev
sponsibility to bolster the pub-
lic’s conﬁdence in journalism
on the local level. Our goal ,
for the year is to profes-
sionalize the newspa-
per from several specific
angles.

Without a solid founda-
tion in journalism, our staff cannot
grow, so our first move has been to
train a competent staff.

We have conducted Comprehen»
sive editorial and reporter workshops
focused on both basic and advanced
journalism. We also plan to take ad-
vantage of the symposium on “us.
Media, Government and Politics,"

not only by attending the discussions,
but also meeting with the journalists
and soliciting specific advice for our
newspaper.

We also plan to bring biek
Grinnell alumni who work as jour-
nalists to train as in all aspects of
'ournalism. Grinnell does not have

a journalism program, or even
a journalism class, but we in-
tend to make use of diverse
resources so that our newr
paper doesn’t pay the price.

Once editors and
reporters have the tools
to effectively report the

truth to the com»
munity, we plan to
increase the breadth
and depth of our re»
porting. _

To do so, we are planning more
longrterm investigative pieces that
focus on in-depth research and nar-
rative rcporllngt We have hired beat
reporters whose responsibility it will
be to know everything there is to
know about their subject, whether it
be SGA or the theatre department,
and report the stories that otherwise

would have been missed or whose nu-
ances would have been lost had we
not known to dig i little deeper.

In order to ensure that we make
use of our new skills in a responsible
manner, we have set up a system to
check for accuracy and accountabilr
l .

We will instill

a strong sense of Wearetamrn/l‘ledlopradatlna
an amarrive paper trial reporls on
then send out w important/55mandreﬂeaslhe
evolution ofourjouma/irlr’tstr’I/r .

journalistic ethics
in our reporters and

curacy surveys each
week to sources for
select stories to en-
sure that writers and editors are doing
theirjobs.

Finally, we will run a corrections
box on page two each week to ace
knowledge and fix the mistakes we
make.

To match quality content with in-
novative design, we have created the
position of design editor. She trained
at the Daily low/m, the University of
Iowa newspaper, to learn how to cre-
ate a more visuallyroriented newspw
per.

We are committed to producing

an attractive newspaper that reports
on important issues and reﬂects the
evolution ofour journalistic skills and
design versatility.

We feel that such journalism of
12 pages is worth much more than 24
pages of journalistic drudgery.

Finally, like many newspapers in
the country, we are
actively seeking
greater diversity re-
ﬂected both in our
content and in our
staff.

We must reps
resent the entire
community and have made efforts
to recruit writers of different racial,
ethnic and economic backgrounds to
ensure that we look at the news from
every angle.

Save space, save lives

Have you ever been sitting at your desk, innocent—
ly typing a report, when suddenly the phone rings?
You, of course, push your chair back to get up, but
wait! Your chair is sandwiched between your desk
and your dresser! Too bad you ate extra slice of pie at
lunch! You struggle to get free as the phone rings and
rings, and then, suddenly, all is quiet.

Folks, this is serious. In small, cramped dorm
rooms the required furniture in the room can some»
times be more trouble than it’s worth. Why can't the
college simply let students return the furniture they
don't need? This would save space, increase student
individuality and maybe even save the school some
money (think postrl-larris partier confusing dresser
for sick bag). I‘m sure there's a little storage s ace
somewhere on campus. Think of the lives (or at east
trouble) we could save.

Please don 'l‘ judge

Coming into Grinnell, I thought I would find
myself in a position where I would ﬁnd an even
richer range of personalities. And while I did come
into Grinnell with expectations, what’s wrong with
believing and hoping that Grinnell would be a di-
verse, enthusiastic, and thriving community? The
general problem i have with Grinnell so far is that
I feel an overwhelming number offirst year students
that I have encountered simply do not reciprocate my
efforts to get to know them.

As oflate,I can't help but feel that I’m being quir
etly judged. I am accepting and understanding of the
{act that I may never talk to some individuals after
we introduce ourselves and make conversation, even
though I don't believe first impressions are a good
gauge of an individual. In my opinion, it is a shame
when a liberal community such as Grinnell, houses
individuals who seemingly refuse to present the op-
portunity to understand their fellow individual.
