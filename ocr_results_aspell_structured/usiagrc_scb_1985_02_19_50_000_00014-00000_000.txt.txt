and to show the People of Ghana as people.

“I ve had people ask me it we lived' in

FT lives in an Area of South Airica not
iar irom Johanesburg or “Joe Brug," as it
is called.

For FT being educated in the United
States means that when FT returns. then it
is likely that the brand oi “Pacifist" will
be stamped on FT by FT‘s fellow Africans

*But education on FT in South Africa
meant reading books such as a biology text
entitled “Biology for Bantus." Education
ior Bantus means and iollowrng a syllabus
designed to teach native Africans to accept
a subservient position to whites.

while rejecting such an education. F’l‘
didn't choose to come to Grinnell per se.
FT was placed here by a special interna
tional program.

s‘fThe South African Education Program
together with the Institute for Interna-
ti0nal Education. looks (or reputable
schools. You tell them what you want and
they will consider your choice. But, since
we-don't know about any except the big
schools such as Harvard. which. I prOV
bably wouldn't have been able to get into,
they just look ior good schools and try to
place you there " FT said

FT prescribes life at home as being far
from the complacent docility eypected by
most Americans. Violence and drug abuse
are the norm.

“A major characteristic of the cities of
South Africa is that there is a lot of
violence. even public lights. You challenge
somebody to go and fight in the street with
everybody watching you," FT said.

However. FT said, “There is a sense of
unity. A lot oi Blacks ‘ they see
themselves as South Africans but the
government is trying to divide them. They
said that you belong to this tribe, you
belong to this other tribe and that you have
to get independence. They say you have to
have a separate country,

“In the sixties they tried to say that this
tribe will have to live in this section of the
City and this tribe will live in this section.
And what used to happen was that every
Friday you’d see a whole hostoi guys com-
ing with knives coming to coniront some

gone.“

FT expressed a leeling oi isolation but
not detachment from the situation at
home. “It would be better to be there." FT
said. “to stay on top oi things."

As {or the United States\ FT said,
perceptions oi this country are clouded by
one major source: “Ebony Magazine."
The magazine, FT said. only presents
upper-middleclass Blacks in America en»
joying the iruits oi capitalism. And this is
all the people or South Airica know or
American Blacks

“We heard about Harlem but we thought
that was an isolated incident but somehow
we couldn't understand how Harlem Came
to be. We didn't know that in every
American city there are ghettos.

”We also thought that Black Americans
were more concerned what was happening
in South Africa then we actually Iound out.
Because in South Africa, the Blacks in
general are on top oi a lot of things that go
on.

“I think “Ebony” magazine is like
another magazine another magazine we
have its called “Pace." Its the South
African counterpart ol “Ebony." It also
portrays successful Black South Africans
and it you look at it you wouldn‘t think
Apartheid existed."

Etawo Ama Dzobo is a sophomore irom
the Volta Region of Ghana. She’d been to
the United States once before to Visit New
York.

“People have said 'you speak such good
English' That’s the question I‘ve had the
most and they are surprised when I tell
them that it was the first language that I
learned to speak." Ama mused.

"1 can't remember the second language
I learned. Now I know seven "

One thing that has surprised Ama about
life in the United States has been the treat
ment of women.

“One thing that Hound surprising here
is the unequal pay. Back home once you’re
qualiﬁed for a job and you get it.
regardless oi your sex. you'll get the pay, 1
mo that very interesting . . ior America
to be so much more advanced than
Ghana.”

Ania said in her immediate family there
is no distinction between the sexes in
terms oi attention or support. Both her
parents have careers. But. members oi
her extended family are not so pros
gressive.

“Most of my relatives think my dad is
wasting his time in trying to iinance an
education for his daughters. In some
families, but not all families in Ghana,
they would have neglected the girls. They
would have sent them to secondary school

have pumped money into the boys."
Ania s rather is a proiessoi- oi Air' an i
philosophy at the University oi Cape C st
in Ghana and he s also the minister ol n‘
Presbyterian Church in the Volta Region
“We have this thing oi Airicnnizing
Christianity, where most people believe
that Christianity is a Semetic religion."

‘ Ama said, “We cannot take it straight as it

is because we are an Air-ican people. we
try to use Airican ways in the christian
worship. So. our churches are conducted in
the local dialects The name at God is the
traditional name used ior our God. he
have drums and other musical .nr
struments which are traditional And. oui
attire is the traditional attire "

'l‘his Alricanizing oi the church. Amzi
believes. may be a rcllection oi a strong
ethnic identity ielt especially by- West
Air-icans, “We come irom a country where
there is continual political struggle To
day. ther'e is a military government which
is prosocialist. Tomorrow. there comes
another one which is pronthis or that which
changes everything. Your lather can be
here today and gone tomorrow. So. you
have to he very aware oi what's happen
mg,”

“1 think Americans are very lucky-
because you have a very stable political
situation so that you are able to go on with
other aspects oi your life. But. back home
we don't have time tohave other aspects oi
our lives, Everything is political, political.
political. But. it makes us very aware. so
that there is no apathy in the country. My
little brother who‘s 12 can tell you what is
going on in the country

“Here. 1 even met one guy who didn't
know the diiierence between Democrats
and Republicans, And, he's in this school.
I'm very surprised. i mean, back home , .,
No way.
