Tupac lives.

Grinnell College lacks any real news.
The S&B has been deemed
unnecessary by students and staff alike
after poll results were released which
show that nobody (except Ioe Haynes)
reads it anyway. More on this next

How Grinnellians spent their Spring Break

best and brightest

In a recent all-campus interview,
Iinterviewed 15 students on cam-
pus. These students were taken
completely randomly, and just,
about-completely randomly be-
tween the two sides of campus. We
had to edit out a few of the re-
sponses because they were too ex-
plicit. Sorry, Grinnellian Idealists,
but in the real
world we have
capitalist Values
to uphold.

Our first inter—
viewee claimed
he saw 20 Rafﬁ
shows over the
14-day break.

Legos, baseball,
Raﬁfi and massage
parlors are just a
few of the ways in
which Grinnell

and size. Apparently too huge.
When our second interviewee
completed the project, he realized
he could not fit the piece out his
bedroom door! Oh, we’re sorry,
poor second interviewee!

Third, we spoke to a Grinnell
hippie who spent his spring break
in the woods of Colorado, hoping
to rediscover his ancestral and
spiritual roots. Guitar in hand, our
third interviewee played calm nice
sweet folk
music to little
furry animals
in the forest.
In fact, we got
a chance to
speak to some
of the sweet
little animals,

Our seventh and eighth
interviewees drove around the
country for the duration of their
breaks. Yeah, you think it‘s prob»

would not say much about how his
spring break went. But, after
much mauling and threatening, he
finally conceded to us. “Okay! I
admit it! Over spring break this
year I hid in the
Grinnell dorms!
There, I said it!
During the day,
when the janito-
rial staff was in
the building, I
hid underneath
my bed, and at
night I would run
naked through all
the corridors!"
When we looked
at him funny and
hit him for being
a fool, he admit-

students entertained
themselves over the
two week long break.

In a move which S&B staffers hope will
drastically improve the quality of Grinnell
College’s weekly newspaper, the staff
subcontracted all of its work to the ants currently
residing in the publications building.

Fed up with the myriad ants crawling on
computers, over walls and up pant legs, staffers
decided it would be best to let the ants run the
paper themselves citing the better work ethic
prevalent among the species.

“No more sleepless Thursday nights for me,”
said former editor-inechief, Andy Weidner. “If
you ask me, the ants got a raw deal on this one.”

The staff hopes that the ants heretofore single,
minded devotion to locating empty soda cans
left in the wake of late-night deadline crunches
can be diverted into providing compelling and
provacative news coverage for the Grinnell
College community.

“Food," replied the new editor-in-chief,
Tttthhhhxt, when asked about any new plans for
the struggling newspaper. “Food food food food
food food food. Food.”

The new 5&8 editor sets his sights high. His
ability to climb walls makes hinipeifectfor

let kids we be

raisin’ in this country today know
how to mosh! Also, our first inter»
viewee had a great deal of trouble
speaking. For the most part, he
could not stop humming “Baby
Beluga."

Second, we interviewed a
Grinnell student who created a gi-
gantic Lego structure in his room
over break, intending to submit the
fantastic piece into the Annual
Lego-a-thon held in Hartsfield, PA
(not to be confused with the
Leggo~my-Eggo-a-thon held each
year in Whilsmucky, IL). His piece

f o u r t h
Grinnell student what he did with
his break, he only replied, “Huh?"
We asked him again and got the
same response. We asked again
and again and finally realized our
efforts would be fruitless.

A fifth Grinnell student told us
about his adventure to the Hale,
Bopp comet over spring break.
Starry-eyed, he praised the expe-
rience and suggested that everyone
try to do the same.

Sixth, a Grinnell female said that
she saw all the Oscar~nominated
films of this year. “I liked Space
Jam with Michael Jordan and Bugs

ably pretty normal and all, but this
road trip had one hell of a quirk to
it. The two students acted out the
roles of Larry and Balkey
Banakomas (from the hit-805 t.v.
show “Perfect Strangers") every-
where they went! Wow!

A ninth Grinnell male bragged
about how he traveled down to
Florida to see some Spring Train,
ing action. He also added, “and I
got some pooh-tang from a few
outfielders, too, if you know what
I mean.”

(Stoneco) in SI basketball tonight
at 7:00pm in Darby Gymnasium.
This game will pit powerhouse
Stoneco against underdog IVCF in
a match to determine who will ad—

road to walk to make it this far.
Some of IVCF’s key players were
lured over to the amply funded
Stoneco after they realized that
IVCF’s contract promises of sal—

vation and eternal life in heaven
could only be redeemed after
death. IVCF’s long—time coach,
God, expressed confidence in his
team despite the setbacks. “We’ve
encountered setbacks before and
always perservered. The Romans,
Darwin, Nietszche—you name it,
we’ve always been number one.”

When asked to speak to the
Stoneco coach, members replied
that the team does not have a coach
but follows a more community-ori-
ented approach to the game in
which every member has an equal
voice with regard to strategy.
Stoneco members were in unani»
mous agreement about their strat-
egy for the upcoming game: “foul
until they don’t know which way
is up, because no matter how bad
you hurt them, they’ll always for—
give you.”

This is the first time these two
groups have actually met headetoe
head in a Grinnell sporting event.
The two parties traditionally have
asked the administration to decide
the outcome of any potential
matchup.

Grinnell student
tried furiously at the beginning of
her spring break to find employ-
ment, Somewhere. Anywhere.
Finally, when it came down to it,
she could only work if she went
to a place she‘s feared her entire
life. The Oil-Massage Palace for
the Elderly. But that’s where she
ended up working.

Our eleventh Grinnell inter-
viewee fled during his spring
break.

The twelfth student we inter-
viewed said she spent her spring
break at home reading travel
books. Wild-eyed and troll-like,
she claimed that “reading the
travel books brought me to where
I was reading about."

Another Grinnell male spoke
depressedly about his pathetic
spring break playing one»man
Cribbage games. “Even when I
skunked myself it wasn’t any fun.”

Our fourteeth interviewee had a
helluva lot of fun with Jello over
break, heh heh.

Finally, our ﬁfteenth interviewee
could only respond “pinball-pin—
ball-pinball” when asked how his
spring break went,
