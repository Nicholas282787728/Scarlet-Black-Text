4 GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK
DEC. in, 1911

Grinnell College,
Grinnell, Iowa,
January 15, 1949.

Dear .loe: ,

This is «wing to he a hard letter to write#
I‘ve never w itten to ‘a dead .man before.

All of us in the hall were certainly shocked
to hear that you ﬁt killed in an auto accident
the day before Christmas. Things haven’t been
the same around the .hall since We came back
to school and found your room empty. The only
things left to indicate tllat you’ll ever lived
there were the marks of nail holes and scotch
tape on the walls. Mom said your folks came
clown to pack up your Stuff the day before we
got here—that couldn’t have been a very pleas-
,any trip for them.

The school has already moved someone in-
_'to youl loom, but he doesn’t drink heel, so it
isn‘t the “palty parlor" that it used to lie. Too
bad you didn’t confine .-yo111 palties to your room
instead of taking them out on the roafl.

Was nice you and Janie collld get together
a couple of times during the vacation (she ala
ways had a .good time when ‘she was out with
you). Those last few dates will ,give her some-

-thing‘ pleasant ‘to think about avhile her fractur-
ed skull heals. Tile doctors say she‘ll be OK
in a few month “except for a few headaches;”
and she can finish .1111 school next year instead.

Doc Sam gave a very moving memorial ad-
dress about you in ARi-I chapel the other day.
He said something about an icy pavement. Af-
ter all those trips to Newton with you, I know
better, but I won‘t say anything except “I told
you so.” You may have been a perfectly safe
driver even when you‘ll “Had a few,” but what
was left of the car (which wasn’t much) would
cause one to Mandel. .

We wont ever completely forget you, Joe.
Especially the remark you made a couple of days
before your acation. Remember? You said,
“I’m just 11 mg to get my hands on Dad’s new
Buick.”
7Well, you did! _
letter off to your folks tonight too. I imagine
they miss seeing letters with the Grilinell post-
mark. Pete.

Democratic Discussion Helps

The A thleiic Situation

The meeting asked for 'n last week's S & B
~was held last night ill President Stevens’ home.
The group included for the alumni and trustees
Messrs. Donald Clark and John R. Heath; for
the administration, President Stevens; fo1 the
athletic department, Messrs Oakes, Belry,
Brown, Pfitscll, and Slaughter for the faculty,
Messr. Charleton, Danforth, and Haner; for
Student Council, Sanders; Honor G, Richmond
and Norvet; the Council of House Presidents,
Harnack, Rees, Leonard, Carleton, Booth, Knox,
and Appleby; and for the S & B, Sanford.

That such a group was called attests the
seriousness and the universality of our
“athletic problem.” That it discussed the sit—
uation openly, frankly, and without acrimony or
recrimination, and profited by the suggestions
made and accepted, attests the value of demo
cratic methods put to use in Grinnell.

In brief, Cakes 11 as criticized for having let
the plessme of a tough schedule oveilide ex-
tremely impoitant factors of pelsonal relations
to his staff, the teams, the student body, and of
public 1elations on au'ay- -from—home games. The
spilit of Glinnell athletics (as outlined last
week) was defined and reaffirmed.

To alleviate the pressures on the coach, and
£10m there to rectify the erlols made, the fol-
lowing suggestions wele offeied: Give playeis
on all varsity teams a priolity on registiation,
to allange schedules consistent with plactice
sessions, and thereby eliminate late practices;
find an able student uho can devote full time
to organization of pep lollies and to co oidinate
them with the coaching staff and team 101 best
effect, devote mine spo1ts space to advance
than to follow matelial in the S & B, 01 pub-
lish the S & l3 twice each week, 1'01 bettei and
more advantageous coverage: create opportuni-
ties for the head coach and his staff to demon-

strate their off-the-field personalities, possibly
by a post-season banquet; organize a student
group to sell Grinnell to promising athletes.
Space does not permit a full account of the
discussion, and therefore this editor 11 cannot be
regarded as alleinclusive. Wesugg‘est that any
of the above listed group can be reached for
elucidation.
, And we highly praise the opportunity to
get together on such a problem It should;
and can—happen more often.

Blind Vet Maintains
High Grade Average
At Kansas State U.

A 25-year old veteran who inst

Open Letter To

The Senior Class

Faculty, janitors, and students
have time and again objected to
the unsanitary, inefficient drink»
ing fountains in ARH. Thrce
wceks ago the complaints were
Ci'ystalizing in a lcucr to the
editor. In that time at least one
of the fountains has been takcn
dcwn for repair.

Unfortunately, only two of the
six fountains produce a Sti'can}
high enough to keep lipstick off
thc spout. And although dust
collecting in the bowls is bad
enough, wads of gum, hair, cig-
arcttc butts, and other Ilnwhole-
some residue make the drinking
pi-cccss nauseating. If the (oullv
tains were easy to clean and ef-
ficient in function, there would
be no pi-oblcm.

hating a worthy project, they
may well consnlcr the fact that
you can hang a plaque above a
fountain as well as a bulletin
board. If they reach this acclsr

find means tn duplicate the
amount raised in order to obtain
several much nccdcii, easy to

clean, effluent fountains.

To THE EDITOR,
SCARLET 1b BLACK

Persistent rumor has it that
there is is man named Mr. R. A.
Hawk assoCIated in some capa—
city 01 othel' with the adminis-
tiation of this institution. I have
heaid such 111111015 for some
months now and taken them with
tile usual grain of salt 1 cally
with me at all limes for taking
things with a. But recently, how-
ever, the question of Mr. Hawk
has stiuck home to me with sing-
ulai- force . . in tile form of a
little note bea ng his signature
suggesting that I diop around
to the ticasu1ci 5 office and shell
out a. i-atbei hefty pile of clams.

Possessing a. goodly measure of,

respect fal- administrative author-
itv however mythical it might
be, 1 forthwith hied myself to the
deSlgnated office and casually re<
quested that 1 be shown into the
presence of Mr. R. Hawk. Now it
may be that my imagination was
playing tiicks, but it seemed that
the gill I was talking to paled
noticeably, avmded my eyes, and
in uncci-tain voice suggestcii that
1 “come back another time . .
that Mrsur-a-Hawk wasn‘t in.

since this first rather strange
vicarious brush with Mr. Hawk,
1 have returned on several occa<
sions; but 1 have yet to see or
even hear the voice of the man.
He has been “busy," “out of
town,” ~'ol- “in the President’s
office."

But today I have been back
again, presented myself at the
front office. swelled my 20-inch
chest, straightened my tiny
shoulders, pulled myself up to
my full height (17ft, 6-in.), and
once again demanded in my most
powerful squeak to be allowed to
see “Mr. Hawk '1

Suddenly Convinced that some
dark mystery lurk: in the shad-
ows of the Ad building, some
silent brooding necromancy

was powerless, I whirled and fled
out of the shadows into the
warming lights of day,

NSA Starts Drive To Send

wuivcrs for DP students.

Although more than 10,000 DP

only a small percentage can be
accepted, Each college will bc

able to choose the applicants who

After they have assured f1-
nanolal support for the now stu-

member collegcs will ask the
plcsillcnis of their institutions

a. "Mr. Hawk," that in due time

‘Duke’ Neglected
To Stop, Look,
Listen For Train

Poor Duke is dead.

Duke was a Belgian shepherd,
yollng‘ and handsome, who once
lay in a lordly manner upon the
libmry steps in the aftcrncon
sun, sui-i-cying the passing throng.
At times, for the sport of it, he
chased the campus squirrcls. Ac-
Ccptlng occasionally the tidbits
and pats offered by students, he
lived a life that was altogether
that of Riley.

But it grew dull, As prey, thc
squirrels were too tamevho had
killed fbrcc or [ouriso he began
pursuing Minneapolis a St. Louis
trains.

One day last week Duke exlllt—
ed in his last chase, Too close to
a passing freight train, he was
stunned by flic step on one of
tho Cal's, stumbled bcncnth lbc
wheels and was klllcd. Duke, likc ,

Caesar, fell Victim to ambltinn.
And now poor Duke is dead.
