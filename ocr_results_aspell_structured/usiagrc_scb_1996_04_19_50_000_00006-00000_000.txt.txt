Remembering OKC

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

One year ago today,1was sittingin DC General Hospital, enduring
health care for the poor. 1 had beensittlng there, waiting, With hundreds
of other people who couldn‘t afford to go somewhere else. The teleVi—
sion sets blared from opposite directions, reminding me of jail, as I sat
and attempted to read. Suddenly, the aura in the room transformed from
an aura of chaos into an aura of mutual concern. Everyone rushed, en
masse, to the television sets. I looked up from my book, confused and
terriﬁed, as if in a sick dream. I couldn’t imagine what had happened.
Did a plane go down? was there a nuclear accidenti.

A bombing! In Oklahoma Cityl My thoughts and world stopped.
I sat glued to the television, mesmerized. trying to identify any of my
friends. I hadn‘t been home in awhile. Would I even recognize them!
I swallowed my heart half a dozen times in the next few hours. I missed
the appointment for which I had been waiting for more than five hours

My parents' next door neighbor was severely wounded, escaping
with her life only by the valor of amazing rescue crews who risked their
own lives and limbs to save as many people as they could. The city, in
fact the entire country, banded together with amazing love and valor.
With the exception of a few racists, stirred up by commentators and
experts, the nation showed amazing solidarity. It was one of the few
times I felt proud to be an American.

When all was said and done, days later, 168 people were dead and
more than 500 were wounded, 1n the end, the main suspeet rumed our
tobe amanschooled in violence by theUS rniliirry, whokilled far more
people in Iraq than died in Oklahoma city.

This reality chills me. As 1 mourn the OKC bombing victims,
another questionposes itself: What is it like to be in a citywhich is being

bombed?

1n the past 15 years, the us has bombed the citizens ofGrenoda,
Lebanon, Libya, Panama, Iraq, ltaqagaln (Jan 93), and Iraq ogrin (June
93). We also shot down an Iranian airliner (in January, we paid the
vietirns ovet$40 million, to little acknowledgment in the papers). The
third bombing of Iraq was intended, nerording to Bill Clinton, to
enforce ri sense of”civllized behavior between nations."

we have also sold me weapons involved in 40 ofthe so eivil wars
oithepnst 10years. The us has given weapons to mnnydietntors for the
slaughter ofmany hundreds of thousands orimpoverished people. How
do these people feel, under constant siege, orten by their own govem—
merits? At least we can proserute the 01<c bombers!

And how, having experienced the real pain and disempowetment
ofsuch a bombing, can] notraise my vorce in protest? It is a surreal fact
that Z of 3 US bombings (MOVE in Philadelphia and the Branch
Davidians inTexas) were conducted by outown governments, And this
one, assuming McVeigh's guilt, was carried out by a man who legallyciit
his murderous teeth on the citizerrsoflmq under us government orders.

Ioffel' to you till apocmby my close friend, JeauStokln, a wonderful
woman who has dedicated her life to allevtzttlng the suffering caused by
our government in Latin America. Also, 1 offer brief pieees on our
nations oddietion to killing in the Third World, multiplying the

US Global Militarism

In the features issue on Latin American Solidarity
Organisation (LASO), l promised an issue discussing
how US war poliey entrenehes us global interests. To
brieﬂy recap that issue: US foreign policy is dedicated to
what Noam Chomsky calls the “fifth freedom." the
freedom ofthe rich nations to rob and exploit the poor
nations, Basically, “the rich men ofthe rich societies are
to rule the world. assisted by the rich men ofthe hungry
nations who do their binding" (Chomsky). l,e., the
developed nations work with :1 (my rirh dictators in the
developing world to extract their resources in a neo—
colonial relationship \vhlch is worse for the developing
world than was strict colonialism, The US uses “free
trade" and the Btetton \X/oods Twins (the World Bank
and IMF) to legally rape and pillage the developing
world and oppress the vast majorities of people in the
developing world,

Presently, the wealthiest fifth or the globe has an
income more than 150 times as large as the poorest fifth,
As we in the developed world consume opulently, more
than 1.3 billion people are suffering malnutrition and
2040 million are dying each year ofstarvarion. This is
twice as many statvlng people as there were in 1984, The
system which enforces this inequity is systemic and
clearly understandable Once we understand how the
system works, it becomes incumbent upon us as human
beings to denounre and work against the structures of
oppression.

Global domination culminates in a US policy of

gnglng in slaughter ourselves, as brieﬂy rovered on these
pages.

MARKETING DEATH

George Kennan, architect of US foreign policy
unrierTruiinn, explained in a Notional steiiniy Conn.
oil Document that in order to “maintain this disparity”
between the rich and poor nations, “we should see to N
that [poor nations] remain in hands we can control and
rely on ..

Hence, on incontinent us arms export policy en-
trenches the power of rulers who malmaln ”Open mor—
kets" (cheap land and labor, lax environmental stanr
tlards, loiv tariffs). This symbiotic relationship fhuSr
banded with billions of US tax dollars) between multir
notional corporations and a few rich men in the devel.
oping counttles desiccates existence (orvost populations
orstdrvingpeople. Each yesrsmee 1991 , the us has sold
more weapons to the third world than all the countries
in the rest of the world combined. selling to HZ of180
nations around the globe.

According to Rosenfield Speaker Lawrence Korb
(Asst. Seer. of Defense under Ronald Reagan), the us
has become “the world’s leading merchant of death.”
The US is now responsible for 3/4 of :1th sales world»
wide. Bill Clinton and the lore Ron Brown have acted as
the top public relations representatives rot us weapons
sales Indeed, in 1993 (a typical year), 90% ofUS arms
sales went to counttles that were not Democracies mid/
or were documented human rights abusers.

The fallout from this global arms bazaar is cata—

MURDER FOR HIRE

method by which lhe US attempts to entrencll dictators
who are friendly to “(rec markets." Basically, LIC utilizes
