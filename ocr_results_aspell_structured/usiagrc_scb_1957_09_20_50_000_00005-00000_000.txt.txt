took until Tuesday to calm the
screaming mob down.

A peculiar feat in Mcars was
“walking the walls.” The plas-

tcr was so faulty that your foot
could acquire a firm enough
)hold to start you pacing around
i the room. Another structural as-
‘pect was that it you decided to
be real neighborly and knock on
the wall, your height) r Could

there was a (lining room in
a huge front porch that ran

wall on her side as you knocked
from your side.
