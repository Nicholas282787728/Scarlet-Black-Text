fear of the word “inhale.” It seems
rather foolish—for everybody inhalcs—
whether they realize it or not . . . every

the smoke he or she draws out of a
cigarette.

Think, then, how important it is to
be certain that your Cigaretxe smoke is
pure and clean—to he sure that you
don’t inhale certain impurities.

Do you inhale? Lucky strike has

dared to raise this vital question...
because when you smoke Luckiesyonr

Luckies have it!

Do you inhale? Of course you do!
