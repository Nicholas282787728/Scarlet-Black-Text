Although Drake made nine first
doyvns to two for Grinnell in the first

even greater in the other direction
for the second half. The Pioneers
made 12 first downs in the third and
fourth quarters, while the Bulldog
runners were stopped without a sin—

'gle first down. The totals for the en-

tire game were 14 to 9.

Iowa stews two-mile team, which
lost to the Pioneers inst week, troniie-
ed Dmku university Friday, all
tire of her men crossing the line
ahead ol the Bulldog runners to give
them the worst possible ninthenmtic-
al drubbing. The score was 15 to 45.

Although Dick Ullrich was shown
to be in n tie with Clarence Highfill
for the Valley scoring race in Mane
'day's Des Moines Register, Ullrich in
reality has only 35 points as compared
to 37 for the Cowboy star. Sand-
wiehed in, between the two is Ross
Hall, the plunging Aggie fullback,
who has so points.

yet to score in the first quarter of
any of its games, it also has prevented
its opponents from tnllying in the
third quarter. In fact, the Pioneers
have had only 12 points scored on
them in the last half all season.
