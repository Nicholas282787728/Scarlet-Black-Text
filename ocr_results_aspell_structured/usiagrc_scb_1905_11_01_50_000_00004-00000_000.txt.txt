3:30 p. m, at the Rock Island, Ten
minutes later we got oil at Turner.
Six miles west OI Gl‘imlell. Tile court-

“0, yes, thank you."

\VC begin the Climb ligllel', higher,
We look back and thinl: whiltit ﬁne

the winter, The school-house is
relwlled and the children are just hur-
ryiilg in irorn the olternuon recess.
All is silent curiosity as the stranger
enter. Introducing himself and re.

school is the work or at moment. In a
Lwinlcle pupils and Leachel‘ are listen-

ed; the strhllgerisufliend. He can
now tallg ll‘ h school, academy, college
ouyuliug which muons more educar

But Lhe next school is Over two miles
away as the crow ﬂies: by road it is
three. That is it would be three if
the country were lerel but. this pru't
or Jasper county suggesl,Nelv Eng
land or the coast range of California.
The road is rough and not much
traveled, but from every hill top what.
beauty! Clusters, clumps, groves or
unit and maples in every direction.
Here they are iii ing ill a deep valley
as if afraid of the northern blasts,
over Lhere they are straggling up the
hillside, and all radians With the bril-
liducy 01 a. thousand tints and shades
of brown and crimson and golden yel-
low, while all the landscape is made
glorious by the October sun.

Three quarters of an hour and the
second Schoolhouse is reached, The
children have just been dismissed but
the teacher is still there A young
man in his teens. How vividly he
makes us remember our ﬁrst term or
schoolteoching in the country. No
trouble to sympathize with him, his

and Tears, all these things are known
to us as though learned hilt yrsler-
dzry. His preparation? Well, if he
should Come to Gl'innell next year he
will enter ﬁrst year academy. There
are thousands ol‘ Iowa‘s best and
briglllcst boys nun girls being taught
by a teacher or no better preparation,
and not all llil\‘e.llie ambition of this
young man to gen up higher. Why
does [his thing collLinue‘! Because
the people in some communities are
unable to appreciate Llle value on
good school,

But it will soon be Clark and we
must get back to Turner by seven
o'clock. Through the woods and
llcross the ﬁelds lOl'amile will shorten

TWO hundred and forty acres of land,
