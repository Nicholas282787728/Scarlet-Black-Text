GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

FEBRUARY 5; I943

 

Swimmers Play Host to St. Ambrose

I ’Only Two Men
Have Re’rurned
‘From Las+ Year

Gl‘innell‘s mel‘men will make
their home debut and fare-
well appearance all at the
same time Saturday after—
noon when they tangle with
the St. Ambrose splashers at
three p. m. in the Grinnell
pooli

The Pioneers will “hit the road”
to fulfill their two remaining
swimming engagements with An-
gustana and st Ambrose.

'Grinnell will be depending on
relatively green materiel Satur-
day, as only two men have re-
turned from last year's traveling
squad of ten. The loss of letters
man Collin Fritz, who entered
the Army Air corps last Tuesday,
has crippled the team considere
ably.

Little is known about the st.
Ambrose aggregation as they
have not had any meets to date.
Last year, however, the Davens
poi-t natators finished the season
with the creditable record of five
wins out of six trips to the post.

The tentative Grinnell lineup
for the individual events follows:

Dashes—Al Frisbie. Dick Law-
rence.

Breast-stroke—Bill Findley, Art
Woodward.

Distance—Ed Nagel, Gill Bres-
nahan.

Back-stroke # Bresnahan,
Hallie.

Diving—Nageli

Athletic director G, Lester Duke
stated that all soldiers. and
townspeople, as well as students
are welcome to attend the meet.
There will be no admission charge,

Ripon Redm‘en
Scalp Grinnell
Cagers. 42-27

Ripon college’s Redmen punctur-
ed Grinnell‘s new victory streak
scarcely before it had begun as
they added the Pioneer‘s scalp to
their collection, 4227 in a game
here last Saturday

The scarlet and black cagers,
cold as yesterday’s pancakes ofr
fensively, made a game of it only
during the first half. Trailing 10—
s midway iii the first period, the
Pioneers knotted the count at 10-
all with eight minutes of play its
maining. Four minutes later the
score was still tied 12712, but two
quick baskets by Striclrlor and
Jensen, and another by Seidel with
10 seconds left. shoved the Reds
men out in front 1842 at inter-
mission.

Teddy Scalissi split the netting
for Ripon as the second half open-
ed, and fr that point on, the
Wisconsin five had clear sailing.
The Pioneers managed to whittle
their deficit down to 2471s after
four minutes had elapsed, but they
were hopelessly in arrears 36-22
with 10 minuta left in the ball
game.

Scalissi pounded home ten points
to lead the Ripon offensive, and
was closely followed by Seidel and
stridler who collected nine tallies
apiece. Harry Waters headed the
Grinnell attack with nine counters
Ralph Hart contributed six Pione
eer points and played an outstand-
ing defensive game.

Coe and Cornell
During Weekend

Grinncll's basketball team travels
to Cedar Rapids this week-end to
take on coe tonight and Cornell
Saturday night. The frosh team
will play Coe's freshmen Frlday
afternoon.

Coe will have intact, save for
one position, a team which defeat-
ed Grinnell at Cedar Rapids last
year by a 34-33 score. So far this
year Coe is tied for the conference
lead with victories over Ripon by
two points, and Knox by a big
margin, and no defeats. Outside

the Iowa Pie-flight officers twice.

Cornell has a .500 percentage in
conference play this year with

Lawrence, Grinnell lost to Cornell
3931 before vacation. Comell
however has lost Howard who
scored 15 points in the previous
Grinnell encounter.

would take the floor with a start-
ing line up probably including
Hart and Kaufmann at forwards,
Waters at center, and Kennofick
and Bowers at guards.
