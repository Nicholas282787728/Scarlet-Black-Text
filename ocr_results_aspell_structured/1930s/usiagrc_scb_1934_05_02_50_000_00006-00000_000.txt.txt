signs of jangled nerves

 

You‘ve noticed other people‘s
nervous habits—and wondered
probably why such people didn’t
learn to control themselves.

But have you ever stopped to
think that you, too, may have
habits just as irritating to other
people as those of the keyjuggler
or coin jingler are to you?

And more important than that.

those habits are a Sign of jangled
nerves. And jangled nerves are
the Signal to stop and check up
on yourself.

Get enough sleep—fresh air
—recreation—and watch your
smoking. Remember, you can
smoke as many Camels as you
want. Their costlier tobaccos
never jungle the nerves.
