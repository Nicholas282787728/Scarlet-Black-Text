People everywhere are more or less
acquainted wtih the SiuorJapanese
conflict which began in September,
1931, with the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria, and has since resulted in
various further complications. The
daily papers have been reporting the
Far Eastern situation as it developed
from time to timeithe Japanese mili-
tary occupation of Manchuria, the
Shanghai war, the establishment and‘
recognition of “Manchukuo” by Jap-
an, and, latest, the capture of Shah-
haikuan and the invasion of Jehol.

While up to the present nothing has
yet been accomplished that will effect
a real solution of the problem (or
rather, a final cessation of armed age
gression on the part of Japan), there
are a number of'facts which cannot
escape the world's notice. First,
thousands of innocent civilians have
been killed and a much larger num—
ber rendered homeless and destitute
and their properties destroyed as a
result of Papan's military operations
in Chinese territories during the past
15 months. second, China has not
been able to offer armed resistance
against her aggressors except in the
Shanghai incident which began on
Jan. 23, 1932. Because she was infer-
ior to Japan in military strength she,
the the very beginning, submitted the
case to the League of Nations~de-
pending all along on this international
organization to right her wrongs and
to redress her grievances.

China Weaker Than Japan

China is undeniably the weaker of
the two opposing parties; that is why
she does not dare to accept Japan's
repeated challenge to an open war,
But let us suppose that China were
Japan's equal in arm's—what would
happen? The result would only be a
deadly war of Japanese imperialistic
interests against China’s self-defense,
Whichever emerged victorious one

,.thing would be certai World peace,
the rose»tl'nted illusion carefully nura!
tured by all nations since the World
war, would he completely shattered,
Does the world wish to see enacted
once more the ugly drama of hell on
earth from which Europe suffered
when the Allies successfully resisted
Germany's military sway? The last
war has taught us the lesson that
when war is used to end war, the
resulting peace cannot be permanent.
This may be why Japan now believes
she can indulge herself in military
aggression without material protest
from the disinterested powers; but it
is exactly why the world should shrink l
to see China engaged in a war, even
of self-defense.

As the situation stands, China,
practically demnseless, helplessly bul-
lied by a greater power, is appealing
to the by-standers for justice. Is she
to be spurned and neglected just be-
cause she is unable to defend herself?
If so, the world will ultimately wite
ness a war scene in which it is not
impossible that all might at last he-
come involved. For world peace will
be violated just the same even if we
have only one of the parties fighting
while the other remains passive, and
the violation will not forever remain
unchallenged. That is why instead of
leaving China alone to cope with her
aggressor as best she can, the League
of Nations has been trying its utmost
to effect a conciliation that would,
above all else, preserve world peace.

league Foils

But the good intentions of the
League have failed to check Japan’s
m itary march. The voice of World
Opinion seems weak, after all, against
the War-cry of one militarysmimled
nation. To people who are still bound
by the timerllonorcd belief in mili-
tarism and to those who have faith
yet in arrogant nationalism, this
might mean the disgrace of China,
the downfall of the Chinese nation,
But to intelligent young minds of the
New Age, it is Lhe disgrace of H.
manity as a, whole, the sad beginning
of a future that looks hopele ly dark
and chaotic.

Is there no remedy then for the sit—
nation? We students of China do not
believe so. At least we are trying our
best to face the situation—before our
countrymen shall be driven to the
extreme of fighting our enemy
whether we are a match for ﬂuem or
not. In the few articles that follow,
we shall try to tell simply and truth-

 

fully what active patriotic work we
are now engaged in for our countr ;
and also what we think of the mill-
tarization of China, of the League of
Nations, and of the United states,
with reference to the Japanese ag-
gressions. In thus presenting our at—
titude, we hope that our friends of
other nations would unite. not for the
particular end of saving China alone
from a relentless Power, but for the
common cause of upholding World
Peace and outlawing its violation.

FORENSIC POSTPONED

Due to the fact that only three
members of the Gl‘innell's men's For—
ensic club arrived, the meeting scheds
uled to be held in Gates hall club
room Monday night was postponed
for the third time. No date for the
meeting has been set.

ILLUSION:

Look at lhis remarkable lady . . . with three lovely and
perfect herds...rll attached to a normal body. She
appears to sir on the stage, with the lower part of her
body concealed by downs. She can wink, smile, and
rod. She can talk, laugh, and singinll at lhe same
lime. Thousands of people have seen this feat of magic
and pronounced it a wonderful sight! '

EXPLANATION:
Audiences used to pay an extra fee to go behind the
scenes to see how this trick was worked. ThL-y dis-
covered that the ihrcehcodcd Woman was mL-l'ely a

[reﬂection in a mirror. The glass showed the heads of
lhrcc girls but lhe body of only one. The other two
were cleverly hidden so that only their heads showed
in the mirror.

...it’s more fun to KNOW

This ”three-headed woman” trick goes
‘way back to the early days of magic.

Also old is the suggestion that pro-
tection [or your throat and freedom from
coughing can be achieved through some
magic trick.

THE EXPLANATION' The easiest ciga-
rette on your throat is the cigarette that
is made from the choicest, ripe mbaccos.

Cheap, raw tobaccos are, as you

would naturally expect, harsh to the

throat. Ripe, costly tobacws are mild,
mellow—gentle. The question is whether
a cigarette is made from cheap tobacco
or the more expensive grades.

lifl I! is a fast, well known by
leaf tobacco experts, Chm
Camels are made from ﬁner, MORE
EXPENSIVE tobaccos Ihun any olher
popular brand.

American men and women have smoked
more billions of Camels than any other
brand because of the appeal of mare m:-
pensiw tobacco: and Matchless blending.

Won’t you stack up your own experience
with a cigarette made from milder, cost-
lier tobaccos.. .against magic claims about
“cigarettes and your throat"?

Try fresh Cnmels-in the air-light,
welded Humidor Fuck that seals the
freshness and coolness, the mildness and
ﬂavor of Camels...inside.
