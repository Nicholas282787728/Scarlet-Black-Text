All the good eggs make
it a point to be smartly
attired at Easter lime. in
these past depression
times where smartness is
an integral part olvalue,
it is twice as easy to he
Iashionable this Easter—
ahout half as expensive.

A suggestion for a per-
Iect Spring suit is a new
semi-drape lwo button
model with notch lapel,
thown in a variety of put—
terns—at least one ex-
actly to your taste.

New tab collared shirts,
salt woolen ties, clocked
silk hose are among the
more original oi Spring's
accessories, and all are
popularly priced.

A sunken foundation often causes a crack in the
chimney. “Misﬁts” or shoes 3 hit too large or small.
narrow or wide — work the same havoc on the human
body. They usually fail to give arch support—permit
the bones of the foot to break down, press on nerves.
Then pains 7 in feet — legs — elsewhere.

Perfectly ﬁtting shoes safeguard you.
Also they wear longer, look better.
