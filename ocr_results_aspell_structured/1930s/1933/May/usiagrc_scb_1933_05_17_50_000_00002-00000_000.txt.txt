A NEW FIELD

With business and professional fields Sll'tll'llls
ing with applicants, it seems that college gradual s
lllight do well to create new fields and new posi-
tions. Just for an example,- such a position as a
“college efficiency expert” might be evolved.
Who knows better than the former student: where

, leaks in budgets and allotments arc to he found?
We are speaking, of course, of no particular col-
lege, but merely the entire field.

This cffi ellcy expert could not expect to he
very popular \vlth Student bodies or even some
illembcl's of college faculties. He would probably
bear the stigma of ‘ spy,” or a still less complie
mental-y title. He would buck up against prolh
lems of student-aid and student jobs which could
not be reduced to a pure efficiency basis. He
would quarrel and quibble with department
heads. But~hc could reduce expenses ill many
colleges, because of Ills lack of personal attach-
ment. if he were an expert ill his line.

He would go over all aecmults of income and
expenditures. He must needs be an expert on food
bllyillgﬂll construction and lllaintcllallcc costs—
on heating, lighting, and plumbing—on the re-
quiremcllts of such departments as athletic, music,
public relations, public’ v, lecture and others. He
must have a knowledge of the best possible organ—
ization of all ordinary student jobs. He must leave
his sympathies at home with his diploma.

Students would despise him and would scoff
at the idea of ever creating such a position. The
(-011 graduate—out ill the cold without all were
coat vould not be so particular. Efficiency ex
parts are wellepaid, for, if they are indeed expert ,
they effect sa ngs which make them sought for at
their own figure.

CAMPUS COURTESY

The ohsc lance of courtesy and friendliness
when person. meet one another on the G1" ulell
campus, is a tradition here. High school visitors
remark that they are pleased with the cordial
greetings which both men and women students '
ielld them when encountering them on the campus.
Most students and faculty members speak when
meeting on paths or sidewalks.

Some time ago, men of the chapel were asked
at a mass meeting ill Herrick chapel. to speak 1’0-
Spectfully and courtcollsly to faculty lncmbcrs
whom they meet on the campus. Most men do this,
we believe. There are several faculty members,
however, who do not return the compliment. Even

GROUP SINGING

The attempt at: group singing in the men’s
dining- room at dinner Saturday could dly be
con ‘dcred a success from the standpoint of a

ic. The sudden pialli. into that followed
each singing of the title words would have been
an almost complete silence had not the more re—
souroeful repeated those words throughout the
Song. Tempo and pitch were minor considerations;
while showerrll'uined voices soon discovered that
cooperation with the group did not bring them
nearly as much attention as a more independent
attitude toward the melody.

But after all, the purpose of the singing was
not to display musical talent, but to promote a feel-
ing of Satisfaction alld coluradesllip that is as
essential for the success of a meal as good food.
And no one can deny that the singing created in—
torest, enlivened the conversation, aroused a fratcre
llal atmospherc‘alld shortened the awkward pcre
iod just before the serving of dessert. Tllc singing
was a success.

Perfect results could not be expected at the
fit t attelnpt. A few more trials would satisfy
everyone of the desirability of Singing at dinner.
The project should not be abandoned.

DR. BUTLER SPEAKS
(College News Sen-ice)

Nicholas Murray Butler has Spokeniand when the
famous Columbia prexy speaks, what more is there to
Say? Asked. “Doesn't the university exist primarily for
the Student?" he is reported to have replied: “No. A
university exists for the pursuit of Truth. Students are
incidental.“

And that's that. Or is it?

Far he it from us to contradict such an eminent
person as the president of the world’s largest university.
After all, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler is Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler. Anyone can see that. But is he also the
Oracle of Delphi?

If he is, he should be able to hand down an earth-
shaking decision on another important academic ques-
tion, viz.‘

”Which came firstithe chicken or the egg?”

That one ought to he easy for Dr. Butler, Let’s
see. A university exists for the pursuit of Truth, yet
if it doesn’t train someone to pursue Truth, how is
Truth to he pursued? But, of course, if Dr. Butler says
that it is more important to pursue Truth than to de-
velop the pursuers, who are we to judge? _

Yes, he must he right: A university would he a swell
place, if it weren’t: for the students.‘

Only . r . Dr. Butler, pleaseiif any of your best
pursuers should ever catch up with Truth, will you tell
him to hang on tight until a few poor, breathless stu-
dents stagger along for a second—hand look? Strangely
enough, they want to he in on the know too.
