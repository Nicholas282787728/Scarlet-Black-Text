“'0 were wondering what or.—
harn Mchlmee wotdd have used
for "gtibbillg" material at the
Drake relays, had he been the an—
nounce A heavy ain iu the morn—
ing, and dangerous looking black-
olouds in the afternoon, spoiled not-
only the attend ice, but also made
the track hci ; therefore all of
the times for races were slow. De»
spite tliis fnet, seven or the rel.
records were smashed, and above
all the Grhillell foui'emilc relay
team galloped away‘for a victory.

a a s»

This win was the first for the Flor
neers since they have been ranked in
the university division of the Drake
relays. “Iron-Mike” Pilbrow, as the
radio announcers insist on calling
him, was the hero of the afternoon
in this event. Pilb‘mw ran an hor
man for the team, and on reeei ng
the baton from Tom Gordon, started
his jaunt with nearly a 10 yard dis-
advantage. Running in his steady
manner, ever the heavy‘traxtk. Pil-
brow slowly gained on the leading
Notre Dame man, and finally near
the end of the third lap overtook
him; held his lead until he broke the
tape after a sprint that looked like
Metcalfe running the century. Pil-
brow was clocked in 4 minutes and
28 seconds, while the time for the
team was 13 minutes and 11 seconds,
falling considerably short of record
time.

Pilbrow not only helped the relay
team to victory, but he also made
his debut on the radio. According
to those who listened, Mike sent
greeting to the dorms.

Several man sitting behind us
during the ram, having imbibed
in a little too much 3.2, were jubil-
nnt at the result. of the four-mile
relay and proceeded to tear dollar
bills apart when the race has lin—
ished.

The greatest applause of the ar-
ternoon was given the Grinnell
team, and the radio announcer was
all for giving the Pioneers “a great
big hand.“

Probably the outstanding race,
from the spectators point of view,
was the two—mile college relay, in
which two Kansas State Teachers
colleges raced the distance in what
appeared to the judges, to be a dead-
heat.

Several hundred people crowded
around the pole—vault, after all
events had been completed, to
much two of Illinois university’s
stellar vaulters attempt fourteen
feet. A movie camera seemed to be
as much of an attraction as the
vaulting.

Metcalfe, “Ebony flash", from
Marquette university, proved to he
all that he was rated, for despite
the heavy track, he heaved off the
century in 9.7 seconds, and aided
greatly in Marquette’s victory in the
quarter—mile relay. For the first 50
yards of the hundred—yard dash, Mats
calfe remained with the rest ot the
field, but after this point it seemed
as though someone pulled him stead-
ily forward, and he finished three
yards ahead of the field.

Dibble hall, well on its way to-
ward the 1932-33 1=ottle trophy, in—
creased its lead last week by defeat-
ing Clark in the final round of the
kittenball series, 4 to 3. Langan
plunged into the depths of the cellar
by losing its final to Smith 12 to 11
in a wild game that was decided by
McLeod’s homerrun in the last of the
sixth. Rawson and Gates had already
finished their seasons.

On the basis of the score sheets
handed in after each game the fol-
lowing mcn were the leading hitters;
Williams, (Clark), Adams and Pat-
ton (Smith), Duncan and Norstrum
(Dibble), and Fini (Gates). Bower
of Gates and Duncan of Dibble led
the pitchers, each winning four
games.
