of the catastrophe, Virginia Ralston
announced her ﬁrm intention of going

there was no sport just like it.

It seems that Paul Crawford once

it takes alive wire to keep a Frigid—

Inasmuch as the friends
Marjorie Littig and Marion Thede
were expecting this weekend are not
going to arrive, Joe Manderfeid tells
us that they will gladly pay any
gentleman's way into the Derby on
a few moments notice. What we can‘t
understand is why Manderfeid is
passing up an opportunity like that.

Quartet Sings at Ferguson;
to Appear Next at Waterloo

The Grinnell college male quartet
and Frank Fiersol, pianist, presented

lin solos, at Ferguson, In, Wednes-

State Bank Plans

Waiver Campaign.

(Continued from Page onei

Sntcen campus organizations
have deposits totaling approximate-
.500 in the hank. They are:
G club, The Scarlet and
Black, Women's Glee ciuh, Grinnell
college string quartet, Recreation
committee, Grinneli college arches
tra, student council, Varsity club.
Women's Athletic association, Young
Men‘s and Young Women's Christian
associations, Cyclone, Moltenser,
Men's government, Clark and Gates
halls, and Sigma Delta chi.
Two Allerlliltives

“We were given two alternatives
by the state," said Batch. “We could
either liquidate immediately or open
under the waiver plan. We chose
Lhe latter to protect the interests of
both the stockholders and the depos-
itors.

“students may receive 25 per cent
of their deposits immediately after
the waiver plan goes into effect,
which we hope will be before the
end of next week. The other 25
per cent will he paid as rapidly as
cash can be obtained from the sale
of securities and the payment of
notes held by the bank," he stated.

Trust Fund Secured

Fifty per cent of the deposits, or
$180,000 will be placed in trust.
This trust fund will be secured by
securities and notes valued at ap-
proximately $236,000. The plan pro-
poses to retire this trust fund with
the future earnings or the bank and
the sale of the securities and notes
pledged to it.

“We cannot sell these Securities
and notes today without losing so
much money by Lhe Sale that the de-
positor will be forced to sacrifice
much of his deposits," said the
cashier.

Better Conditions Expected

“In other words," he said, “Imme-
diate liquidation of our assets would
prohahiy yield the depositor far less
than the actual value or the waiver
plan will realize. But, under the
waiver plan we will be able to
liquidate under better market con-
ditions and save the depositor a
great loss.

“Since the hank examiner checked
the records of the hank and ap»
praised its assets, commodity and se-
curities, markets have risen with the

program," he added. The waiver pe-
riod is not to exceed three years
from the date on which the state
superintendent of banking accepts
the plan.

New Deposits Unrestricted

All new accounts opened with the
hank under the present system and
the waiver plan will have no re»
striations placed upon them. “The
new depositor can ohtain all of the
money that he has deposited at any
time lie desires,” Bach said.

When asked if depositors could
borrow against their deposits held
under the waiver or in trust, Bach
replied, “DchSItOIS will be able to
borrow against their deposits but
not in full. How inucii they can bore
row will depend upon the merits of
the individual loan‘s."

W4?—

A friend of CHESTERFIELD writes us of

a salesman who had "something to say”:

"I dropped into a little tobacco shop,
and when I asked for a pack of Chest-
crﬁelds the man smiled and told me I
was the seventh customer without a
break to ask for Chesterﬁelds. “Smoker
after smoker,’ he said, 'tells me that
Chesterﬁelds click . . I sell ﬁve times
as many Chesterﬁelds as I did a while
bac .’ ”

Yes, there’s something to say about Chest-
erﬁelds and it takes just six words 10 say
it-—“They’re mild and yet they satisfy.”

Wher vei- you huy
Chesterfieldsyou get
them just as fresh as
if you came by our

iactory door
