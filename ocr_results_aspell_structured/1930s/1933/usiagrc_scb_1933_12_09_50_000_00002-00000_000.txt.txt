OLD MANUSCRIPTS

The definition of the powers and functions 0
student government at Grinnell during the past
few years has depended entirely too much on tra-
dition, hearsay, public rclatiolls departmont pamph-
lcts, and the personal reactions of student and
faculty groups in charge. Mcanwhilc, forgotten or
obsolete constitutions, by-laws and amendments
have been gathering dust in files of the adminis-
tration building or in offices of faculty officials.

Next spring is the logical time for definl ion
and revision of student government on the Grin-
ncll campus At that time, definite outlines of the
functions of the three existing governing bodies,
or re—organizcd governing groups, Should be pubs
lishcd in easily available forlns, within reach of
all students.

As an example of one power granted to the
student body, which has not been ill effect for the
past few ycal's—eprobably because of the total ig-
norance of the student governing organizations rc~
garding its cxistenccwtllcrc was discovcrcd this
week‘ an excerpt from the minutes "of a faculty
meeting, April 7, 1925, requesting the Student,
Council to name student committees to meet 1‘ch
ularl with such standing faculty committees as
admi istrntiou, curriculum, athletics, social affairs,
religious services, and student organizations and
publications A plan is laid out “for facility and
student cooperation by conference and discussion,
alld reference to the proper legislative and admin
istrativc bodies of matters of mutual collegc con-
cerll.”

These student committees, according to the
plan, were to meet with the corresponding faculty
committees at stated times throughout the year as
arranged by each conference group, and on such
other occasions as might seem desirable. The entire
student committee was also declared free to call
for a conference with the faculty committee.

A general college council, composed of the en—
tire membership of all of. these committees, and
presided ovcr by the dean of the college, was to
meet for the consideration of college affairs.

From this report it may be seen that if all

of the official documents in regard to student gov- l

crnmcnt here could be resurrected froln various
files, cullcd, and brought up to date, a workable
and responsible system of government might be
devised from existing material without the llcccss-
ity of much rc-organization.

OAN IT BE?

Thc Eighteenth Amendment is no more. Rather
late for sucll an announcement, you say? For
ﬂuvcral days the world has known this fact, and
ill‘ selnglll months, it knew that soon it would be
true. N, ponder. The Eighteenth Amendment is
no more.

The college generation of today has little or
no knowledge of tllc cra bcfol‘c the federal liquor
law was in effect, When we first began reading
newspapers and noticing the trend of national af-
fairs, we were intrigued with the stories of boot-
lcg gang warfare and the cartoons of the lank
sounvisrtgcd gentleman with the umbrella, dark
spcctaclcs and plug hat. We hcartl both sides of
the controversy over the question of prohibition
evils vs. prohibition benefits. It was so completely
a part of ollr ago that, particularly ill this section
of the country, we rather unthinkingly accoptcd it
as all enduring problem, to be continually hushed
over but never solved, in the manner of Thanksgiv—
ing vacations, student government, and meat balls
in the dormitory dining room.

Yet, suddenly it is at an cud. In some parts
of the country today, men are carrying bottles of
liquor openly alld hra7cnly on the streets yet uue
ablc, withal, to sup s entirely on a of guilt.
Like the long-caged lion who stores with shockcd
surprise at an open door before him, man> when
granted a new irccdom, is not able immcdiatcly to
rid himself of his inhibitions, nor to realize that

the padlock is gone.

DEPRESSION AND THE AUTOMOBILE

The word ”dcprcssion ” has come to bc ll bug-
bcur to the average American. Tllc publir s sick
of hearing it and is trying to forgot it, but, the lat-,1
remains that the country, and the world at, largo,
is still in the period of dcprcssion 1hal began about
1929, Though conditions have improvcd Somewhat,
we cannot simply pull ollt of the slump by trying

to forget tllc dismal word. Pcrhops President
Roosevelt is il new Moses (‘mllc to lead the Ullitcd
soups out or tho, l‘inallciul wilderness, but, appar-
ently (hero is still ll long road ahead.

"thing from ininnlure golf lo the ml or
iht‘ Hhzlill‘, collcgc lm‘u” ll s ll(‘(‘l\ blzllucll for the
depression, all to no avail, Hard limos hove cons
ﬁlmed and there are still thousands of men who
lll'C lookingr for or Ind unable to land a job.
Du' a discussion ill on economics class this
u-cch \ good bluuol'od uttclllpt was luadc to place
the blzuur for the whole affair upon the automobile,
and the Slll‘p ' ’ig [act was that on tho surface
such an accusation scoured very logical.

-It the farmers hlld stuck to horses instead of
taking up the use of the tractor, an outgrowth of
the automobile, lhcl‘c would not have been so
llluch overproductiouhf form producc and the
farm depression might not have rcsultcd. Install-
ment buying rcccivcd its greatest impetus in the
field of the automobile, and thus pcopltt were led
to pm-ehnse more than they could pay for, which
only hastened tllc depression. Because of the auto»
mobile, miles and hides of paved highu' 's have
been constructed, for which taxes have been ill-
crcascd and states have gone into debt. The great
success of tho, automobile, rcsultillg in the increased
value of stocks of the producing companies and
ill overproduction on such a large scale, only helped
thc other stocks to boom to unreasonable heights
till the crash caulc. Other factors can be pointed
out, but the important thing to notice is that tbc
blame for the depression can be traced similarly to
other causes with the some outward appearance of
complete proof.

The class discussion rcfcrrcd to was not in-
tended to bc a serious placement of all the blame
for our present situation upon the automobile, bllt
so often writers and speakers havc attempted to
shift all responsibility onto one such set of facts.
However, it would probably be a closer analysis
of the situation to say that each so-collcd cause
for the depression was in reality a partial cause,
and that all blcndcd together in a succession of
events to produce the dcprcssion we are now cx—

pcriencing.

WAR CLOUDS AND CHEMISTRY

“The next war will be a tcrriblc carnage",
states Professor M. in some popular journal; “The
next war will wipe out the present civilizationl”,
cxclaims the scientist, J., ill oncthcr magazine
article; “The next war i just around the corner,”
says the editor of solnc well known newspaper, and
so we read nearly every day such allusions to tho

.ncxt war, as if- it were an established fact that

there would be anothcr great struggle ill the very
ncnr future.

If this lookcdefor war takes as much time to
coluc around tho corner as prosperity has, most of
us need not wot \' about another scigc of war
movies and boo" But such talk of on illlpending
war is perhaps toundcd on a more serious world
outlook today than molly are aware of, ill spite of
the frenzied efforts. on the part of Solnc organiza-
tions, toward world peace.

The failure of thc great powers to come to
terms on the aru out, question, the apparent
breaking up of th av agile of Nations and depreciae
tion of its influellnc, along with tho llnrcst and
intense rival ' among the European powcrs, com-
bines to g , a situation which has often been
likened to a keg of high explosives with easily
ignitcd fuses cxtcn ting in many dircctions. The
presence of the J nesc-Russo-Chincsc triangle
also complicates the no) out and furtbcr weakens
the already insecure twig upon which the (love of
pedcc manages to sit.

All this talk and probability of war brings
about more. talk from those who aim to draw up
nicc orderly rules for the "l xt“ conflict. Thcrc
is agitation to outlaw some of the more horrible
chemical ulcthods of fighting, in case there is one
other war. “If we are to kill each other let us do
it in a sportsmanlikc way,” would seem to be their
argument.

‘th, since the Armistice in 1918 the sci—
entists of the leading countries have discovered
new and more ghastly means of eliminating large
sections of humanity, and in spite of any agrees
ments which nations might sign now to refrain
from using such fiendish methods of destruction.
it is not at all probable that the signers would live
up to lhcir pledges. It seems to us that the diplo-
mats of today should worry more about preventing
the next war than about trying to keep chemistry
out of such a conflict, for “once started, a forest
flrc cannot be curbed by legislation.”

FRIDAY NIGHT GRIEVANCE

A longetilnc sore spot of many Grinncll stu-
dents has recently been causing much comment.
We speak of tllc collegc rule against having men‘s
open houses on Friday nights when lccturcs, rce
citals, plays, etc. are being given, until after the
said performance has been colnplctcd.

\Vc feel that the students have indccd a just
gricvancc, for under those conditions the open
houses bordly begin before the coeds must bc cs-
cortcd back to the quadrangle. As tastes differ
and there will always be students who will attend
tbcsc affairs and some who won’t, it seems only
reasonable that at least onc hall should bc open
at tho regular hour for dancing. All tlle house
lncthcrs do not attend all such Friday night func-
tions, and we £ch sure that tllcrc would usually be
at least one hostess staying ill hcr hall anyway, or
if not, an outside chupcronc could bc callcd in. All
arrangement like, this would be amazingly simple
and sllould please all pal .

THE DEBATERS DILENHVIA
_ Most of the college debates on radio control
lnugo upon the question: Arc the American radio
programs high-grade or low-grade?

The final tcst would be to decide what the
educated and intelligent person prefers. Assuming
that we in tho dorlnitor' arc both educated and
illtcll' ll, what do we like to hem“! ‘Opcl'zt, symr
phonics, lcctul‘cs, debates? Well, soluctilucsiif wc
can’t got anything bolt

Frankly, we prefer Bing f’rosby to Beethoven,
and it good football game bl-ozlllcnstcd ill plzlcc of
tllc Philharmonic orchestra. We would gladly tullc
oil Fritz Krcislcv to hcllr solnoouc moan about
“Mlnnio with o heart as big as a whole," or the
nasal “Get along, little doagic, get along,”

“The dollar is ready for a nose
dive in a few months or \vcsll's",
declared Joseph W. Charlton, assoc-
iatc prolessor of economics, in his
discussion of the inflation problem.
Those who have bonds and stocks are
destined to see failure, he believes,
while those who have invested in
real estate are fortunate.

“We are an optimistic people and
debts incurred with unwarranted op-
timism can never be paid with the
old gold dollar." he concluded.

Friday

Selections of the composer Schu-
mann were presented at the organ

ceeded by a short introductory sketch
by professor Henry Conard.
