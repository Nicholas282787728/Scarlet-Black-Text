ADVANCE ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR CHAPEL

Comes now Once again this argument of
whether or not chapel programs should be all-
nounccd in advance. Last year, Tlle Scarlet and
Black continued its former policy of advocating
the announcement of all chapel programs. This
year a'conlprolnisc has been effected whereby all
special and the more important chapel programs
will be announced in advance in Tho/Scarlet and
Black.

Here are the major arguments for and against
announcement. The late and beloved President J.
H. T. Main believed that the chapel period provid-
ed a short time each day during which students
could relax, could gain ”spiritual inspiration.’
and could enjoy music or an informal talk. He
went so far as to tell students that there were
some programs which “were a bit dry,” hull that
he enjoyed the chapel period even at these times.
becausc of thc restful, spiritual atlllosphcl}. He
believed that announcement of programs would
destroy this atmosphere, in as much as students
would gather to hear a specific address or pro-
gram rather than to absorb the quiet chapel spirit.
It was a beautiful ideal, as were all of President
Main’s ideals.

Then, too, there are scvcral faculty members
who have objected to announcement of chapel pro-
grams for various reasons, one of the more under-
lying being, we believe, that they would rather
not have the size of thc assemblage present dc-
pcndcnt upon the popularity of the speaker.

Yet the fact remains that student attendance
at chapel last year was not good. There wcrc cxr
ccllent informal tillks delivered to a scattering of
students in tllc rear section of the building. There
were worthwhile musical programs which were
heard by “Dad” Richardson at the door and a
few faculty members and students inside.

With the announcements ill The Scarlet and
Black this year of all special and the more import-
ant chapel programs, this situation will be
changed. There is no danger that students will
stay away deliberately from chapel programs
which are not announced, because if they arc in
tclligent they will realize that a sincere effort is
made to arrange interesting and worthwhile pro‘
grams for all chapel programs whether the result
is successful or not. At thc\sanle time, the special
programs, having been announced, will be attended
by all interested students, many of whom might
have neglected to be present otherwise.

It is probable that a schedule will be carried
out this year of arranging musical programs for
the Wednesday periods and organ recitals for the
Friday periods, with informal talks on the other
three Weekdays.

GYMNASTICS FOR.GREDIT?

Physical education credit is part of the grad-
uation requirement of this college. It seems to be
firmly entrenched as such. Of course those par-
ticipating in athletics are able to get this require-
ment out of the way without taking any actual
class Work in gymnastics or swimming; also one
is able to work it off through intramural sports
or by being a member of the band. However, this
still leaves a large number of students who must
go to regular classes to get this credit.

Now the question arises—docs a stleent get
much real benefit from being forced to take some
form of gymnasium work? After college-what
then? Docs the average business man keep on with
the exercises that he was taught to do. in a college
gym class? "We believe not.

If every student could be taught solne one or
two specific sports during his college career, would
not that be much better? Nearly every person is
capable of mastering some sport at least to a fair
degree of proficiency. Yet many persons are grad-
uated from college without being able to parti l-
patc in any sport, merely because they have never
had the opportunity to learn one, or to practice it

If the time required for physical education
credit were spent by a student in learning some
sport in which he was interested, such as tennis,
golf, handball, volleyball, etc.. and if he could bc
under the guidance and supervision of one who
was capable of properly coaching him, he would
have something of permanent value when he

COLLEGE CHARACTERISTICS

In a tillestiolluirc sent out by the Grillncll
Y. M. C. A. this summer, students were asked what
characteristics should be cultivated ill college.

Other Opinions

‘ A WELCOME To FRESHMEN
(Daily Trojan)

There are few experiences that compare to that of ‘

entering a large university as a freshman, and fortunate
are those high school graduates who can look forward
to the opening week, Especially is this true at the
University of southern California, whieh today wel-
comes a large class of incoming students.

College atmosphere is so refreshingly different
from schools which most freshmen have attended.
There are new standards of freedom. more liberty, more
thought of the student as an independent, self-reliant
individual who realizes that whatever he does at the
university he does of his own initiative without the
goadings of instrustors.

The first week will find the freshman ﬂattered by
the hospitality of fraternities, and no will no doubt declare
that "college is great” as he accepm invitations to rush
parties, dances, and luneheons. He will find professors
going out of their way to arrange his program, and
the alumni association giving him a luncheon. He will
be impressed by a different way of doing things. a way
that win seem to him pleasantly sophisticated, yet per-
fectly natural, and he will find it remarkably easy to
become accustomed to his new surroundings and his
new friends.

But for most students, freshman week ends all too
suddenly. While today there is entertaining, feasting,
rushing and gladrhanding, on Monday the newcomer
must take to his textbooks and settle clown to the task
for which he came to college, that of seriously attempt—
ing to further his edueation. ,7

Unfortunately, the genial welcome extended to
freshmen tends to implant in the minds of the first
year students that the rounds of entertainment with
which they._are greeted are synonymous with college
life. To such persons we wish to give a severe jolt. Col-
lege, despite all propaganda to the contrary. is still
a seat of learning, a place where academie endeavor
is the first thought, an intellectual attainment the
highest goal. Most freshmen realize this all to late,
meaning. of course, after the semester's grades come
out. Hence, this bit of information is passed on, in the
hope that it may benefit those who look at university
life only through the rose-colored glasses of freshman
week. .

GREETINGS—AND some SUGGESTIONS
(Iowa state Student)

FRESHMEN: The Iowa State Student welcomes
you to our campus and all that it has to offer you for
the coming four years.

since your arrival here you have been beseiged by
advice from every nook and creviee. Advice has been
jammed down your throat and hammered into 'your
head. You have received advice for breakfast, lunch
and dinner; and by this time doubtless you are ready
to sock square in the eye the first person who opens a
conversation with:

“It's been my experience that . . .
you to . .

Now some of us have been around here for several
years. In that time we have picked up a thing or two
worth passing on. So open your mouth wide and let us
slip a tablespoon of castor oil down your throat. It'll
take only a minute and we know the medicine will do
you good—because it’s tried and true.

1. study. Your first two years are your hardest;
they're basic and extremely important. After your soph—
omore year there will be time to think of other things.

2. Get into an activity (not a dozen aeti ties—
ONE activityl)~if you can afford to take time from
your class work. You Won’t. notice it during your. first
or even your second year, But we know (because we've
seen it happen so frequently) that if a student gets
his feet tangled in too many activities, before long he
isn't doing for all of them what he should be doing
{or one.

3. Make friends. Nowhere at any time will you
ever again have the opportunity of meeting and as-
sociating with as many worthwhile people as you have
at college. That means “dates," students and members
of the fuultyaverybooy. There is no better way of
self-improvement than by associating with people of
greater mental and "spiritual” capacities than yours.

There are a Couple of hundred other things that
might be said. These three are important. They win
suffice for the present.

But let’s don’t get too serious about this. It isn't
a life and death proposition. a person can do all of
these things and still have a col-hing good time doing
them.
