Tuesday

Mrs. Flora Smith, instructor in
public school music, spoke on “The
Mikado" and Gilbert and Sullivan, its
authors.

Gilb‘ert, the dramatist, and Sulli-
van. the composer, first met each
other in London, in 1871. ”The Mir
ltadu", ninth in a Series of success-
ful operettas which they collaborated,
was produced in March, 1885, and
ran Continuously for 672 nights.

Gilbert’s clever satire, while direct-
ed mainly at contemporary abuses,
is so general in its nature that it hits
the eternal Wealmesses of human na~
ture.

\Vednesduy

The Grinnell college male quartet,
Consisting of David E. Peck, Chester
Williams, Fred onl, anddack Peoples,
sang a group of four numbers, "The
Night Has a Thousand Eyes,” “In a
Distant Land", "Gathered Roses",
and “Sweetheart".

At Vespers

Dean Thomas W. Graham of the
Graduate School of Theology, Ober-
lin college, presented a modern par-
able at vespers Sunday, He told of
a “great Teacher who tried to bring
his message to our modern America."

“First he was in Kentucky at the
scene of a coal strike, pleading with
the miners to realize that their work
should be done for more than their
'da’iiy h'rea‘d,‘th'st their‘ coal was real-
ly accomplishing a purpose and they
should work for that purpose."

Miners Believe

“The miners at first believed him
and followed him, but soon they be-
gan to ask why he did not talk with
the mine owners."

“He said he had, that he tried in
vain to impress that the importance
of giving coal to those who need it is
more than that of gettingmlargier
dividends. Then, just as the mine
owners had turned a deaf ear to his
eloquence, sc the miners turned from
him to follow the radical speakers
whose promises were fairer than his."

, Goes to College

“He was next seen in a college,
above whose door was inscribed the
word "truth”, but it was so embell~
ished with carving that the lettering
was almost illegible. Here he preach-
ed the doctrine of freedom, real free»
dom."

"He said the college students were
patternized, that if they had a statue
to the unknown god, he would in-
scribe on its base, "Everyone’s Doing
it." He pled with them to really free
themselves, telling them that their
much-decorated motto of truth was
like their college, but the faculty and
students alike talked vaguely of their
“purposes" and pedagogical ideals
and did not heed him.
