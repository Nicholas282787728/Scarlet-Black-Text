Pioneers Drill for Drake Tilt

 

College Will Cut Student Cost

 

Action Taken
for Reduction

of About $100

Blanket of $620
to Cover Yearly Items;
Effective Next Fall

Charge

A cut of approximately $100 in
student expenses at Grinnell, to be
effective next fall, and substitution of
a yearly blanket charge of $620 for
tuition, board, room, and all fees.
were announced by President John
Scholte Nollen last night.

The matter was approved Monday
night by a committee consisting of
President Nollen, Louis v. Phelps,
college treasure Prof. Charles E.
Payne, and Prof. Earl D. Strong, af-
ter consultation with both deans and
the public relations department.

At a meeting of the board of trus-
tees Saturday, Oct. 7, the matter
was referred to this committee for
action.

Nollcn Explains

“Grinnell college has decided to
simplify its financial relations with
its students and its constituency,"
declared President Nollen. “Here, as
in most colleges, the gradual devel—
opment of new services has led to an
increasingly complicated apparatus
of fees, which'added substantially to
the fundamental charges for tuition
and living; and even these charges
were on a sliding scale.

”On the other hand. there had
grown up an equally complicated
system of scholarships and student
aid which was increasingly difficult
to administer wisely and fairly.

"Beginning with September, 1934,
this cumbersome system will be
abandoned and there will be a single
blanket charge of $310 a semester,
or $620 for the year, covering tuition,
room, board and fees, including the
'semester fee,’ which admits students
to all concerts, lectures and athletic
events on the campus.

3100 Reduction

“This represents a reduction of ap-
proximately s1oo from the ordinary
total of charges under the old sySr
tem. Scholarship grants, for which
the college holds substant'al endow-
ments, will also be simpl led in ad—
ministration, as will tuition charges
for students not living in college
dormitories.

"Patrons will thus have more defi-
nite information about the exact
cost of a year at Grinnell and will
not be vexed by an unexpected ar-
ray of extra charges. Students who
need help will still be cared for from
scholarship funds and by available
jobs."

Marousek Named New
President of Juniors

Frances Marousek of Sioux City
was chosen by the junior class as
president for the first semester, at
an election in the quadrangle little
theatre last night.

Old, Oaken Bucket at Stake Friday;
Ancient Vessel Develops Curvatures

All Drake-Grinnell
Painted on Trophy Here;
Established in ’29

Scores

on the eve of Grinnell's tradition—
al battle with Drake univerlsty for
the old. oaken bucket, the startling
discovery that the treasured trophy
is in a sad state of decomposition
has been made.

A year's confinement in the trophy
case near the north entrance to Car
negic library has caused the oaken
emblem of victory to warp until its
days of useful liquid-holding service
are indeed ovarieven for such solid
liquids as beer.‘ Yet, the Pioneers and
Bulldogs will fight just as hard for
the trophy as in the past.

Four-Year Hiswry

The old, oaken bucket possesses
quite a history. Four years ago, a
hardy band of Pioneer fans retrieved
the vessel from a basement in the
dormitories and offered to award it
to the victor of the Drake-Grinnell
game that year. However, the Pie»
neers had retained possession of the
trophy when the referee's whistle
ended the game in a 6-6 deadlock.

Drake then got a strangle hold on
the bucket in 1930 when Grinnell fell
in defeat. Not content with the Vic»
tory of ’30, the Bulldogs reiterated
their right to possession with a nar-
row-margin victory in 1931.

Last year, Coach L. L. (Fuzz)
Watt's warriors punctured and bat-
tered the Bulldog line until they fi-
nally pushed over the only touch-
down, converted the extra point, and
assured themselves a 7-0 victory.

All Games Recorded

So once again the Drake univer-
sity Bulldogs are challenging Grin-
Dell's right to keep the ancient

Haskell to Oppose Grinnell

in Kansas Nov. 11

Approval has been given by the
Grinnell college faculty athletic
board, for a football game between
Haskell Indians, and Grinnell at Law-
rence, Kansas, Nov. 11, Armistice
Day.

Negotions have been carried on be-
tween the two schools for several
days. Prof, Earl D, Strong, chairman
of the faculty board announced his
approval after the matter was given
consideration by the members. other
members of the group are David E.
Peck, J. w. Gannaway, and Joseph
W. Charleton.

Haskell Tics Creighton

The Haskell team has already
played one Missouri valley team this
season, fighting Creighton to a score.
less deadlock two weeks ago, Last
Friday night the Indians were de-
fcatcd by Temple university 31 to 0.

with the exception of these two
games very little is known about the
Haskell team, Several years ago
somc of the strongest teams in the
country were turned out from this
school.

Loom Player Acquainted

Many of the men attending the
school are above the average age for
a college football player. Jim Bradley,
flashy indinn halfback for the Grlnr
ncll team, is acquaintedwith meme
bers of thc Haskell team.

This game will fill in an open date.
and will give the Pioneers nine
games for the season. On the week—
cnd following the game Grinnell and
Drake will clash in the second of
their home and home game arrange-
ment.

 

Initial Valley

League Game
Slated Friday

Bulldogs Have Best Record;
Twm Schools Will Play
Thirty-Ninth Game

When the Grinnell college and the
Drake university football teams clash
next Friday night on the Bulldog
gridiron, it will be the thirty-ninth
battle between the two schools since
1896.

Competition has been fairly even
throughout this time, with Drake
winning 22 of the tilts, Grinnell cape
turing 15, and two of the games end-
ing in a tie. The Pioneers hold the
high scoring record. having defeated
the Bulldogs 71 to o, in 1913.

Drake Leads Conference

So far this season the Bulldogs
have a far better showing than the
Pioneers. They are now leading the
Missouri Valley conference with two
victories, one, a 6-0 upset over the
fast moving Creighton eleven, and
the other from an unexperienced Bute
ler team. Early in the season Coach
Vce Green's men made an impressive
showing against the University of
lllinois crew.

Coach Green has 14 lettermen on
his squad, and a large group of cap-
able sophomore candidates. In the
games played so far this season he
has featured a combination passing
and running offensive attack, being
especially successful against Creigh-
ton with the former method. Frank
Smith, well-known Missouri Valley
sprinter, plays at one of the flank
posts, and is quite adept at snagging
passes.

Linc is heavy

Led by Captain Paul Brechlcr,
guard, the Drake line has been fall‘s
ly successful in stopping its oppon-
ents so far this season. Lowell And-
erson, 210 pound tackle, who was
hurt in scrimmage recently, may be
kept out of the game with his injury.
At the beginning of the season Green
had expected to have trouble with his
backfield men, but several of his re-
serves from last season have develop.
ed into capable men.
