why is a cow
in this ad? a '

I because the lady has the prize
cow of the county (evidenced by .
the blue ribbon about its neck)
and we have the prize hull of the

campus.

because a cow is a quiet, docile
animal, and the gridiron ban-

quet isn't quiet or docile or an

animal.

because a cow is not afraid of
its past life an

those who dare attend the grid-

iron.

beause the cow is contented and

happy and so will you be when

Here’s one that's o little old but
like Roquefori. cheese it ripcns with
age. A few weeks ago Kathryn Fan
roll was calling hor home in Mason
City from the cloister phone booth in
the quadrangle. Upon completing the
call, Kathryn was horrified to find
herself locked in the phone booth,
The resourceful girl courageously
called Mason City again and asked
Father what to do. Hc advised call—
lug college central, and being some»
what worried about the outcome, told
his daughter to call him back on her
release, This she did, thus completing
her harrowing experienceI Tomorrow
night we play “East Lynn" featuring
“Who’s air-aid of a big had telephone
booth."

A week or so back, his women’s

varsity date with Mary I-Inll cost

him both entrance and checking

Loren Lindquist, Smith prep, called
Betty Ann Waller for a date to the
Cyclone ball. Betty said that she
didn't Iecl like dancing or didn't
'dance or something brit added that
she’d like to see Loren some time.
Quick as a wink the little Waller girl
had him dated up for the next Tucs-
day nighteher only night out next
week, according to freshman rules.

old Timers down town were
somewhat startled last week to
hear thruider on a cloudlcss day
but it has only 40 or 50 masculine
hearts cracking in rmisorr at the
news that Harriet sokol had been
cainpused for three weeks. The
loudest crack came from Bennett,
who saw toni- very substantial
dates viinisli into thin air. Incident-

iroises in Iowa City whence Douch-
ler was planning to come dorm to

the Kelly house party.

Well, it looks like Lou Van Nos-
trond and Fran Collins have come to
a parting of the ways. Fran’s a good
girl but she puts her toast crusts in
a clean cereal bowl every morning.

We're a little bit puzzled nnd
bafﬂed about Louise Goodwin’s e -
tonsive knowledge oI feminine
bricks. After all, where docs one go
to iind out what constitutes a pore
fcct birch? Should the vertebrae
show in bumps? Should the book
be slightly swayed? How broad
and how long should the perfect
book be? We know a ycry nice girl
whose back is just a little bit
swiiyed.
