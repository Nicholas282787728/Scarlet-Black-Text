Grinnell Clash

Proffitt, All-Indiana Center.
Nets Seven Baskets
for High Score

By MAX ltoss

Just why is it that a basketball
team must reach its hottest streak
against Grinnell‘s Pioneers is a mat-
ter of conjecture. such was the case
Tuesday night when the newest addi-
tion to the Missouri Valley confer-
ence, the Butler Bulldogs, romped
away in the last half to an easy 56-22
win over the local .team.

Shooting from impossi ' angles
and cashing in on slightly more than
40 per cent of their shots, the blue
clad Bulldogs could not be stopped,
despite the valliant efforts of a Grin-
nell team that was battling hard up
to the final gun.

Lead 22-13 at Hall

With Proffitt. allrIndiana center.
dropping in five field goals in the
first half. the invaders drew far into
the lead. The Pioneers made a des»
.perate effort to keep the score close.
the count at half-time being 22 to 13.

At one time the score stood 32720
in the second half. but immediately
'after that the Bulldogs staged the
“hottest" strcak ever seen on the
local court, scoring 22 points in sues
cession before Ullrich dropped in the
final Grinnell basket. One more goal
made it 56-22 and the game was
over.

believed that higher standards
scholarship and loyalty to the ideals

recognition of women that possess
