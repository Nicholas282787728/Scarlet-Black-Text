100 Hear Recital in Herrick
Chapel Last Night

By John G. \ iley
(Campus Editor)

A concert by the Grinnell college
string quartet that often penetrated
depths too dn‘ficult for a layman's
mind to fathom but off-set by several
vivacious and appealing movements
was well mcelved by more than one
‘hundred music lovers in Herrick
chapel last night.

Margaret Bently strong won the
enthusiastic approval of the audience
,with her viola interpretation of the
presto movement in Beethovenls quar—
tet opus 59, numbcr two, and in Boc-
chernini’s allegro vivace in quartet
number eight.

‘Carried oit Gloi l

David E. Peck with his violin, car-
ried off much of the glory of the can»
cert, both because of his consistently
fascinating performance and his posir
tion on the stage.

Robert Livingston, playing the vice
lin. and George 1.. Pierce with the
violin-'cello are to be commended on
their part, but they wore over-shad»
owed by the others throughout most
of the concert.

The program was not without its
tiring spots but it was always caught
in the swirl of vivacious and interest-
ing movements that recovered the
listeners' interest, and culminated
with the live allcgro vivace movement
in Boccherini's quartet number eight.

The regular
'Pioneer cagers

Uilrich off Mon d a y,
Tuesday, and Wednesday so that they
might concentrate on their semester
examinations. Meanwhile the reserves
were sent through long scrimmages
with the Freshman team, in which
they held their own for the most part,
Lineup Uncertain

The starting lineup tonight is in
doubt, although it will probably in-
clude mlrich, Santi. Mason, Collison,
and Captain Duncan. McMillin,
Menus, and Farzybok are sure to see
action. Coach Trueedale is taking his
entire squad to Des Moines for the
game.

Both the Pioneers and the Bulldogs
have won only one-game this year.

to keep out of the Missouri Valley
conference cellar. Grinnell has been
beaten by Creighton. Butler, Minne-
sota, Washington, and Coe, while the
Bulldogs have lost to Iowa, Butler,

ing to an announcement {mm John

Iowa, Feb. 10

Because of a change in the track

met in a dual meet for over a decade,
Grinnell placed only 10 points behind
Iowa in the state indoor meet. held
at Iowa City last year.

Thc Pioneer trackstcrs have not
yet seen action this year, but should
have a strong team, since 11 letter-
mcn are available.

pected to win Grinnell points are
Harold Alexander. sprinter; Myron
Pilbmw, nationally known distance
star, and Clarence "Snap" James.
