Political, Racial, Economic,
Social Attitudes Wrong

in Speaker’s Opinion

Dr. Walter H, Judd. medical misc
sionary to China, presented the
Oriental attitude toward the United
States in his address at vespers
Sunday.

“Their opinions of us, right or
wrong, must be dcalt with, to make
for amicable relations between nib
Lions," said the missionary. He ex-
plained that this would be hard to
accomplish. because of the tendency
of every nation to be certain that its
own motives are right and to be Sus-
picious of any other country's mo»
tives.

Dr. Judd declared that there are
four American attitudes which must
be changed, because they spoil the
missionary's work, and give the lie
to his words even before he has
uttered them. According to the
speaker these four are the political,

racial, economic, and social types of
imperialism.

“The Japanese particularly fear
our political imperialism," said Dr.
Judd, “for they believe that we are
aiming toward them." He further
stated that the United States is re-
cially imperialistic: “As the native
in Africa said after the advent of
the white man, ‘Wc had the land.
and he had the Bible; now we have
the Bible, and he has the land.”

Dr. Judd gave the following pro-
gram for arriving at a better un-
derstanding with the Orient. In his
opinion, the United States should
try to improve its moving pictures
for "they have done more to destroy
respect for this country than any
other thing since the World war;”
should send over respected, business-
like diplomats "likc Dwight Mor-
row'," should change the attitudes of
American tourists abroad, “for they

Langan Passes
Moratorium
on Razors

The Langan hall spring house
party Saturday wiu resemble a real
hill-billy gathering if the motion
adopted at the last house meeting is
carried through.

Planning a "hard times" party, the
Langanites decided to make it more
realistic, and passed a resolution that
they would not shave until after the
night of the party.

What the results will he of a
week's absence of razors from the
brawny countenances of such men as

Men Elected
Cyclone Heads

Johnson, Maxeiner Chosen
by Yearbook Staff

Frank Johnson, of the class of
January. '35, and William Maxeiner.
'35, were elected editor and business
manager, respectively, of the 1935
Cyclone, at a meeting of this years
Cyclone staff Monday night. They
will succeed Virginia Ralston and
Mark Trumbull.

Both men are members of the staff
of the 1034 annual. Johnson, who has
been a reporter for The Scarlet and
Black for a year and a half, is dormi»
tory editor of the Cyclone this year.
He has also been active in drama
work here.

His election to the editorship marks
the first time in several years that a
man has held this position, His ap-
pointment is unusual in another way:
in that he will be classed as a Sopho<
more during the first half of the com«
ing year, since he entered Grinnell
at mid-year.

Maxeiner is serving as as "stant
business manager and advertising
manager of this year's Cyclone, and
has also been prominent in men-s de-
bate. He originally entered Grinnell
in the class of '34, but was out of
school last year.

The new Cyclone heads expect to
have a meeting in the near future for
those wishing to hold positions on the
staff next year. The new staff will
not be chosen definitely until the fall,
however.

National Players
Plan to Initiate
Crabb, Schissel

Ruth Crabb and Marion Schissel
were pledged to the Crinnell chapter
of National Collegiate players, na»
tional honorary drama fraternity, re—
cently. The initiation will he held
Saturday afternoon, June 3, accord-
ing to present plans.

Both students are juniors and have
been active in drama work here for
the past two years. Miss Sehlssel is
also a cottage chairman-elect for next
year. She has acted in a number of
plays, the most recent being Clifton
Lamb‘s original production which was
taken to Mason City scveral weeks
ago

Miss Crabb has been in several
public productions as well as class
oneeact plays. Both are taking courses
in the drama department at the pres-
ent time.

Restored by Hall Council

Social privileges of Dibble hall,
temporarily removed by its president
and house council last week, were re-
instated at a house meeting Mon-
day, by the some authority.

of violations of hell rule's,” declared
Luther Hemphill, Dibble house presi-
dcnt, “but the difficulties have been
satisfactorily cleared up, and social
functions will continue as before."

 

Valley Teams
Trek to Drake
This Weekend

Oklahoma Aggies Favored
to Vie With Hosts

for Honors

(Spatial la The Scarlet and Black)

DES MDINES, [mom—Much has
been written about the superiority
of modern track and field athletes.
but many of the Missouri Valley
conference records which will be
tested here this week end are hoary
with age, yet comparatively fast.

Back in 1912 a gent from Iowa
State college named Farquhar ran
the mile in 4:214. It took nine
years of endeavor before that record
was matched and it was the famous
Watson of Kansas State who tied it
in 1921. Since that time the best
milers of this section have failed to
equal or better it.

Formerly Open Affair

Saturday, however, Ray Scars of
Butler, Grant Thompson of Drake,
of Joe Ffeiffer of Grinnell are con-
ceded a good chance to erase the
long-standing record from the books.

In the prewar days when the
Missouri Valley conference meet was
an open affair, athletes from all
over the country competed here. 'In
1913 Illinois ran the mile relay in
3:193 and the mark still stands, al-
though Drake may surpass it Satur-
day.

Cowman of Rolla School of Mines
in 1914 set the 440—ya'i’d mark of
ASA. This year none of the valley
quartermilers are expected to beat
this good time, although the confer—
ence is not lacking in good perforlrr
SIS at this distance.

Simpson Still Champion

Coach Bob Simpson of Iowa State
college must still get some satisfac-
tion from his Still-standing Misourl
v‘alley standards in both hurdle
races. Simpson, competing forMis-
souri in 1916, did the highs in :14.6
and the lows in :233

Des Moines university, a school
discontinued several years ago, still
is represented on the valley record
book since Johnson of that school
ran the half in 1155.4 in 1920. It is
much better than an even bet that
that record will be intact next
week,

In 1926, 1027, and 1928 athletes
of the valley, which then included
schools of the present Big Six coir
ference, hung up seven records which
still stand,

Aggie Relay Favored

Roland Locke, Nebraska’s famous
sprinter, established marks of :095

1926. The same year Cox of Okla-
