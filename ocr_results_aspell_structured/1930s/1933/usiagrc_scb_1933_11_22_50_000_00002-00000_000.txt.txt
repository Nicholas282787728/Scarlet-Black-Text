‘ REVERENCE FOR ANTIQUITY
I-Iumllnity seems to be blessed, or cursed: witll

a great reverence for antiquity and all that antiqei

uity has established. One of our Iavoritc idols is a
constitutioll—eparticularly the federal constitution,
but also state constitutions and e have come to
think of their framers as divinely inspired to writc
with all omllisccllce which should apply to all time.

Ill Iowa we are still living under a constitution
which was written for an age long pnsscd, When
there was no automobile, we had to have 09 ccuil-
tics and 99 separate sets of officials; now we can
drive cor s the state ill a day. but our 90 govern»
lnellt districts are still hole, and township‘ too, all
of them eating illto thc $85,000,000 which gocs
every year on government expenditures. Ollr colli-
plcx county system is oilly one of the many IllStlr
tutioils needing reform, bllt it is typical.

At last the state has recognized our serious
need for reorganization, and eight molltlls ago, at
a cost of $30,000 it asked the Brookillgs Institute
of Washington, D. C. to study oilr problems and
lnalic'a report. Now the report is finished, and its
recommendations should be of vital interest, not
only to those who 1ch ill Iowa, but to all whose
parents pay taxes ill any state of America.

William F‘. Riley has selwcd as chairman of
the state committee on reduction of governmental
expenditures and is one of the best informed men
on this subject in all Iowa It is typital of the
Leaglc of Women Voters to tak all interest ill
good government. and their blillgillg Mr. Riley to
speak to us should be a real contribution to com»
luullity thinking along these lines Every stu-
dent who is conscious of the problems upon wllich
his economic welfaic dcpcnds should be ill chapel

t 7:45 to hear his address on “A Survey of (lov-
ernlnent,” The attendance will be lt fai indication

These men believe that official recognition of
Russia will stimulate industrial activity in the

trade will ham to be financed by our own govern-
intuit.

The, matter of the American military occupa-
tion of the Archangel region during tllc World war
has llcvor llccll definitely closed. Some of our ex-
pt)l-ts mil go to repay Russian damage claims for
this invasion. But this recognition of Russia might
sot oilr iildi trial machinery into motion ill once,
which would spccd up the Pl-csldcut’s recovery
program.

It is hell 1 by Professor Grass that recogni-
tion of Russi is a good move that should have
been made in thc Hoover administration wllcll it
became evident to Amoricalls that, the Soviets were
not trying to undermine the capitalistic govern-
ments of the world. The Soviets are too busy at
home to attempt dcmoralizatioll of other nations,
esp, My one as strong as the United States.

Stock quotations on the New York stock

Although there were noticeable price increases ill

move, wl ting to see what kind of credit machinery

RUSSIAN RECOGNITION.
('nle Dally Tar Heel)

At. last, after about 16 years, the United states is
preparing to lccognize Soviet Russia. The stability of
the Russian government cannot have been seriously
doubted for the past 10 years, and the stability of a gov-
ernment i supposed to be the basis of recognition by
the family of nations

The principal official excuse for the failure of the
United states to recognize Russia has been the ropuoia
tiorl of the debts or the Kereusky government by the
Soviet government, That seems almost farcical when
one considers the chaotic condition of
finance since the war, With England asking for
reduced terms on her debt-to this country and even
hinting strongly at cancellation, it is hardly consistent to
quibble over a small debt which was made by a govern-
ment that was overthrown in a revolution by the Conr-
nlunist: party.

Russia has had a checkered career in international
affairs since the Soviet government came in, but she
has had a stable government and has behaved better
than her sister nations in many respects. Her large
population and tremendous land area, and her enormous
undeveloped natural resources, makes it very important
that we delay no longer the establishment of relations
with her. It is very fitting that Roosevelt end the
Democratic party bring this about, especially when we
are making such a strenuous effort to improve our
foreign and domestic trade.
