VALLEY RIMBLINGS

Last. week's rulnor concerning the admission
of Goo, Carleton and Cornell into the Missouri
Valley conference brought into the open agitation
which has 0 sted for a number of years in favor

' of reorganization of the circuit. While the rulnor
has been proved groundless, it served a worthy
purpose in revealing the dissatisfaction in the Vale
ley ranks.

Suggestion of possible new members of the
conference has been a regular procedure at prao»
lically every meeting of Missouri Valley officials
since the secession of the Big Six members ill 1927.
Of the many institutions suggested, only Creighton
and Butler were granted entrance. Since their ace
ccptance, any number of other schools in 0 been
considered and rejected for reasons varying from
unsatisfactory educational rating to remoteness
from the Valley circuit.

Probably the only means of adding to the con-
ference membership will be through some manner
of compromise Tllat is, if an Iowa School is ac-
cepted, it will only be after schools equally access-
ablc to Oklahoma Aggics and Butler are approved.
If Butler withdraws, as is expected by conference
Officials, the problem will be somewhat simplified,

The Indiana s liool was ill the ill graces of the
North Central Association of Colleges preceding its
entrance into tlle Valley group and, in sight of
recent developments, it seems obvious that its
application was based mainly on the desire of rc-
establishing its reputation by association with a
recognized conference. At least, after only two
years in the circuit, the school has dropped g icl
competition with Valley teams and inferred that
it will announce a formal withdrawal from tho
group before the yczlr is over.

The some difficulty in connection with new
members will remain, however, since thrcc differ
ellt regions will still have to be considered, The
Aggies and Washington might be able to agree
on a. school which would possess equal attraction
to their fans and the three northern institutions
and Washington might reach 2i similar agreement,
But even in'Bntler’s absence, it would appear that
at least two colleges would have to be added at
the some time to prevent disscllsion in the league.

In the past few years the scllools lnost flic-
quently mentioned as possible additions to the coir
fcrcnce group include St. Louis, Tulsa, Oklallolila
City, Michigan State, Marquette, Washburn, Coe,

and Detroit. 1n every case, the illaoccssahility of
lllc school to some of the present lllolllbors offers a
lllajor consideration. In addition, some of them at
the present obsoi-vc eligibility rules which would
disqualii ”will from luclnhcl hip, while still
others c iliot moot lllc rducational standards of
the Valley group. ,

lt looks us it' the conference werc llctwccu tllc

' ' “devil and tho drop liluc 50a”. The
net-rs . I'or organi lion and dovolopllit‘llt of
the group it it is to retain its prestige is obvious.
Yet 0 ' ting conditions sccm to oppose any attempt
at ll-mb li tioll. The officials will convene Sun-
dl ' in Des Moiucs to ooluplotc business considered

ing [0 John C. Tl'uesdalc, di or of atllloti ', it
is illlpro able. however, that a loll will be taken

into the conference.

WHEN DO WE GROW UP?
(Daily Trojan)

“Well, I'm free, white, and twenty-one! I certainly
ought to be able to use my own judgment in this mat-
ter,” was the defiant assertion made by a typical cam-
pus “grown-up." Using his chronological maturity as a
basis upon which he might exercise his freedom. he
seemed secure from the stifling control of the world in
which he lived. And what is more convincing, this
twenty-one year old genius was going to be granted an
A.B. degree in June, which would further entitle him
to flaunt his superiority in front of the folks who were
trying to run his affairs for him.

If a person has to wait only until he has passed his
”legal" birthday and earned a college degree before he
can muster a “grown-lip” mentality, the process seems
quite simple and only a matter of patience. Why is it,
then, that it still remains necessary to hire “nurse-
maids" with uniforms and shiny badges to keep our
"grown-ups" from killing themselves at traffic cross-
ings, and shyster lawyers to save their pride and repu-
tation from heavy fines or imprisonment? There are a
lot of folks who have been "voters" for many years.
who would still fail the simplest examination in “The
Fundamentals of Maturity," which would cover the es-
sential requirements of knowing how to behave oneself
without being continually checked up and watched.

The trouble lies either in the system of education
or in the crowd of students who have supposedly taken
advantage of its opportunities. After listening to the
“conquerrtheworld” talk of an average graduate it
seems safe to assume that a college education has done
wonders for the patient. But when the man folds up
like a circus tent in a Kansas cyclone because of a cruel
and practical World, the strength of an education suf-
fers a severe setback.

Four years of psychology, literature, history, and
philosophy may enable an “overreducated” graduate to
talk circles around a, lot of people. but it doesn't seem
to help him ﬁll out an income tax report correctly or
understand that benefit teas and dog shows Won't. solve
the problem of unemployment and starvation. A mam
education is an asset when it opens his mind, but when
it loosens his tongue, the world soon passes judgment on
the net results of his ”growing-up" achievements.

'Value-Concepts Necessary
for True Religion’—Conard

lEll‘lAV/DlE/l
aWWMS.

Monday
Mary Wood, '34, discussed the
characteristics of Cats, to Whom the
“world around is nothing and whose
only concerns are their saucers of
milk.” While dogs follow and adore
their masters, Miss Wood said, cats
arc different: "they go their way and
you go yours.”
“Cat‘s have distinct and definite
personalities," the speaker explained,
before analyzing the qualities and
peculiarities of her own pets,
Tuesday
Dean Shelton L4 Beatty rcstated
the purpose of a civilization as an
attempt to make a good life increas-
ingly pOSSible. “We are all lost in
this oivilizatiouithere is so much to
do. A man scarcely knows where he
is going," he observed.
Concerned with the possibilities of
individualism, Mr. Beatty weighed
the cost of the Individual education
against that of mass education. "Al-
though one is Constantly attempting
to determine What he shall do With
himself, he should devote himself to
improving his individual nature in-
stead of working with his environ»
ment,” the speaker declared.
"We must. seek maturity," Mr.
Beatty emphasized. “A good life is
not possible through education of the‘
masses,“ he concluded, “but we may
approach a good life only through‘
the unfailing devotion and strictness‘
required for an individual education.”

“Out of a residual effect of past

experiences comes all powerful cone
ccpts of values.” declared Henry s.
Canard, professor o[ botany, at vese
pcrs Sunday. “It was concepts of
values that made Alexander and
Napoleon the great men that they
were, and that have carried many
artists and martyrs through all the
tortures of their lives."
, Religion is not true religion With-
out concept of values. according to
the speaker. “The greatest service
of Jesus of Nazareth is the creation
of these concepts."
