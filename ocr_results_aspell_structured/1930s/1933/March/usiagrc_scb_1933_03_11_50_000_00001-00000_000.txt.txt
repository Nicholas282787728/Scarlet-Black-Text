Critigﬁaucls
Holst Recital

Observer Rebukes Students
For Non-Attendance

By ll. w. Motlaok
(Professor of organ)

Among many fine things about

l—Iarald B. Holst's singing the most

- delightful to me, is

the amazing

satility of his rcpcr-

toirc. When he on-

notuices a recital

you may be pretty

sure that his selec-

tions will cover the

m o s t important

Holst fields of song writ-

ing, and moreover nothing trivial or
threadbare will be included.

Within the space of a few weeks
he has appeared in the leading role
in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, he
has taken the baritone solos in
Brahms‘ Requiem, one of the most
significant compositions of the mod-
ern era, and he has given a song re-
cital in five or six languages, includ-
ing the Scandinavian, beginning with
Mozart and ending with the present.

“Mastersingcr”

With these accomplishments Mr.
Holst abundantly earns the accolade
of “Mastersingel‘.” not only because
he knows where to look for fine and
unusual songs, but because he knows
so well how they should he sung.
His voice grows richer all the time;
he has on exceptional clearness of
phrasing and enunciation, so that saw
on when he sings in Finnish you think
you can understand it.

He was equally at home in the lof-
ty mournfulness of Beethoven's
dirge, which opened the program. and
the fragil tenderness of the French
songs, and in one or two instances
only—not enoughihe let go with the
vigorous freedom which is his great-
est charm. musically speaking.

Wants More English Songs

If it were permitted to make ob-
servations concerning his program I
would recommend that he brighten it
a little by introducing English songs
at the beginning as well as at the
end. It is really asking a good deal
of an audience to listen to Italian,
French, German‘aud Scandinavian
before you get home.

John McCormack and the late Da-
vid Eispham were masters of pro—
gram arrangement, and neither of
them ever delayed for a moment get—
ting their audiences with them
through songs that were tamiliar
enough to be recognized and en-
thusiastically received, assuring the
hearty reception of everything that
followed.

Making her first appearance after
a long siege of illness, Elsie Haggard
Ryan added immeasurably to the ef-
fectiveness of the recital. l-lcr accom-
paniments are always models of their
kind. Every nuance of the background
receives its emphasis, and she has
that mysterious sixth sense which
tells a good accompanist what the
singer is going to do even before he
does it.

Too many undergraduates skipped
this recital, to their great loss.

‘Bank Holiday
May Stimulate
Business Rise’

The bank holiday, in spite of its
unpleasant immediate effects, may,
in the cod, prove beneficial to busia
ness, in the opinion of Joseph W.
Charlton, associate professor of eco—
nomics, when interviewed on the sub-
ject.

“The restoration of confidence in
the banking system should have a
stimulating effect on business," said
Professor Charlton. “Moreover, the
issue of several billions of new money
should have the same result, assllm»v
ing that the bulk of our 40 billions in
deposits are not frozen indefinitely."

“There is a feeling that business
can go no lower, and must, therefore,
improve," Professor Charlton continu.
ed. “Hence, paradoxical, as it may
seem, the breakdown of our banking
system may be a constructive lnflu—_
choc in the present Situation." ‘

Frederick L. Baumann, associate
profcssor of history, when interview-
ch on the question, said that he did
Knot consider himself fitted to render
a definite opinion. “As far as I cani
see," he said, “the only thing for us‘
to do is wait and pra

ship, in a speech delivered at the an-
nual banquet of Phi Kappa Phi, hon-
orary scholastic fraternity, in the
Memorial Union, at Iowa State 6017
lcge, Wednesday night.

According to Dr. Nollen, big busi-
ness men were considered great lead~
crs, until 1929, but the depression
showed that, obsessed by a desire for
gold, they did not think for the good
of society.

He maintained that life now is in-
finitely more complex than it was a
generation ago, and that the rules of
thumb are no longer applicable.

President Nollen described dieLa—‘
torship such as is found in Italy,
Poland, and Russia, as a "patholog-
ical state of human society" and
stressed the need for a great spirit-
ual leader, such as Gandhi is in lo-
dia, in the United States.

Three faculty members, 19 gradu-
ate students, and 47 seniors were tak—

en into the honor society in on initia»
tion held before the banquet.

 

Social RoomWellEquipped;
Plan to Open Doors
Next Week

Growing out of the depression and
the need for cheaper means of enter-
tainment, the plan for s Grinneli col-
lege recreation center has finally been
carried out and the refornished room
in the basement of the women's quad—
rangle will be opened next week.

with a low expenditure, the more
ation room has been rejuvinated into
a social center, which may be used
for ping~pong, cards, jig—saw puzzles
and othcr games as well as for read—
ing, music and the regular Wednes-
day evening dancing.

Grinnell students should find ample
relief from study at the six new red

table, the newly overhauled phono-
graph, the table of magazines and the
easy chairs.

Mrs. L. v. Phelps, acting dean of
women, announced that men may be
entertained in the recreation room

nights, but Friday, Saturday and
Sunday nights will be reserved for
women.

Miss Sternfeld's advanced design
class is planning a decorative panel
for the north wall of the room. This
permanent panel will be in a frame
four- feet wide and seven feet high,
and more of these may be made later
on. It is also planned to have the art
classes design some tin lanterns to
use as shades over the hanging lights.

Those who have done most of the
work in preparing the new recreation
room are Miss Smith, Mr. Gale, Miss
Sternfeld, Miss Kathryn Heywood,
Alie Rosenbloom and Mr. and M:s. L.
v. Phelps.

The whole plan has been carried
out with little expense, the card ta-
bles being the only new purchases.
Other places of furniture have been
donated, resurrecte dfrom around the
college, or rebuilt.

Further plans arc not completed
and any suggestions will be welcome;
also students who can bring maga-
zines to the room when they have fin—
ished reading them will greatly help
the cause.
