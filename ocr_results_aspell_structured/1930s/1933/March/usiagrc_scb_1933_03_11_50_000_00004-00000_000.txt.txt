Inlvroolionri cont-monomer

To anybody who has tlle slightest
interest in the present Japanese out-
rage in China. and who observes with
impartiality, it is obvious that the
Japanese militarists regard the
League Covenant as nothing more
than a scrap of paper. They, them
selves, know very well that their
action is a direct violation of Article
X of the League Covenant which
reads as follows:

Violation 0" Covenimt

"The Members of the League un-
dertake to respect and preserve as
against external aggression the to i
torial integrityvand existing political
independence of all Members of the
League. . .

But instead of seeking a means for
a peaceful settlement, the Japanese
militarists are doing all they can to
aggravate the situation, Time and
again the Chinese Government has
Called the attention of the world to
the Japanese acts of aggression and
at the same time has asserted that
the Chinese people desire to uphold
the League and to submit to its de-
cision in settling the issue. Although
Such has been the assertion of nut
Government, the Chinese people have
not always been patient with the
League. For during this hour of
crisis, when the enemies have broken
through our gates, bombed our cities

and slaughtered the inhabitants, it is‘

really too much to expect any people
to be patient.
League Slow to Act

The indecision of the League as
shown in its actions in the Sinc—
Iepanesc conflict produces among the
Chinese people an attitude of aver-
sion to this international body, More
and more they are coming to believe
that this instrument of international
settlement cannot be relied upon and
that its effort in surmounting the
ditiiculties will amount to nought.
They read the Lytton Report with
some disappointment for, besides the
crcation of a world opinion unfavor-
able to Japan, they can see in it Im
satisfactory solution oi the problem.
Tune and again labor unions, mci
chant associations and student or.
gonizations have urged the Govern-
ment not to rely upon the League
but to prepare for the worst by call-
ing the nation to arms. Taking into
consideration the losses which China
has incurred since the problem was
submitted to the League, who can
blame the Chinese for assuming such
a position? However, a few words of
explanation should be given, for this
attitude is most apt to he misunder—
stood,

‘Awaits Achievement‘

Institutions that should be are not
institutions that are. The League oi
Nations with full power to coerce
the violators of the Covenant and to
maintain World Peace, is an institu-
tion that still awaits dchlevement~
an institution that exists in the ideal.
The actual League today is still an
imperfect one. It is apparently able
to employ no more sanction than that
of world opinion; its force is only
moral force. It is unable to “preserve
as against external aggression the
territorial integrity and existing po-
litical independence of all Members
of the League."

Being too eager to have their prob-
lem settled by the peaceful means of
international cooperation the Chinese

.people have failed to distinguish be-

tween the ldenl and the actual, Here—
in lies the secd of disappointment,
That the League ought to curb the
will of the Japanese mllitarists, stop
[he “undeclared walfarc“ in China.
and apply Article XVI of the Cove-
nant has been constantly demanded.
but it is not being carried out by a
League which is still in the making.
Satisfaction on the part of the
Chinese is therefore attainable only
when the purpose of the League is
realized to a greater degree by the
combined effort of those who espouse
the ideal of world cooperation.
Chino Abidcs by Covenant

But in the face of disappointment.
the willingness that our people have
shown to avert war and to secure
international cooperation is already
remarkable. China still abides by the
Covenant. The Government is leaving
no stone unturned in its ctfort to se-
cure a settlement of the whole issue
by peaceful means It remains to bc
seen how long this policy of restraint
can continue in the face of popular
feeling when the Japanese, armed to
the teeth, are penetrating to the very
heart of the country The more our
national istcnce is threatened, the
more certain it becomes that we must
fight, whatever the cost. The struggle
may last for a generation. But is
there no other way in which to deal
With one nation that, with imperial-
istic aspirations, thus threatens to
smash the p hrs of world peace?

Gordon Group
To Come Here

String Ensemble Prominent
In Chicago Music Halls

Jacducs Gordon’s String quartet,
famous chamber music ensemble,
will make its initial appearance in
Grinnell next Friday night at 8
o’clnck in Herrick chapel,
Beginning it's career 10 years ago
by playing to audiences of frequently
not more than 40 or so people in one
of Chicago’s smallest auditeriums,
Jacques Gordon’s popularity increaSr
ed until, during the past season, every
concert of this famous organization
was attended by more than a thous-
and listeners.
The slow. sure growth of the Gare
don string quartet is a fascinating
chapter of contemporary music his»
tory, rivaling that of Fritz Kreisler.
Achieved Wide Prestige

A Wide prestige achieved by Gordon
as concertmaster of the Chicago Sym-
phony orchestra first attracted at-
tention to his efforts with the string
quartet, Later fine quality playing
and interesting programs put the
Gordon concerts among the bright
events of the Chicago musical sei-
son,
Even wider recognition was at-
tained when the organization was in-
vited to participate in the annual fes-
tivals held at the Music Temple,
in Pittsfleld, Mass, These events are
attended by critics of the entire
world.

popularity Began to 1927
Gordon's first great popularity be-
gan in 1927, the year of the cclcbrs.
ticn of thc one hundredth anniversary
of Beethoven's death, when his cri-
scmhlc paid tribute to the great com—
poser by playing cll the master's
string quartets in a series of con-
certs.
The success of those concerts con-
vinccd Gordon that the time was ripe
for a renaissance of popular interest
in chamber music.

Resigned Chicago Spmplmny
Further concerts under the
ces of the Chicago Chamber Mu—
s c society resulted in such pnpnlari-
ty that Gordon resigncd his position
with the Chicago Symphony or
tra and devoted his whole time to the
string quartet. His popularity has‘i
been great ever since.

Political Figure,

Building I of Dormitories
Dedicated June 24,
1919

Smith hall, first of the men's dorm-
itories to be named, was christened
in honor of James A. Smith, bener
factor of Grinnell college, and long .a
dominant political figure in Iowa.
Mr. Smith, on Osage lumber mag-
note, was a trustee of the college
from 1887 until his death in 1918, at
the age of 65. The bulk of his twor
million dollar estate went to his
family, but he also made a number
of bequests to various organizations.
0[ which the largest, 335,000, went
to Grinoell college.

Dcditnitcd Building 1919
In recognition of his services, when
Building I of the dormitories was
dedicated, on June 24, 1919, it was
named in llis honor.
AS head of the James A. Smith
lumber company, which had several
branches in northern Iowa and
southern Minnesota, Mr. Smith
amassed a large enough fortune to
enable him to devote most of his
time to politics. Becoming a Republi-
can leader, he was one of the most
active and influential men in the
state for 25 years.

Entered Politics in 1888
Mr. Smith began his career in
politics in 1888, when he was elected
to the old general assembly of Iowa.
After serving two terms in this body,
he resigned, but was elected to the

Smith Hall Named in Honor of Iowa

 

of the leaders in Roosevelt's cam-
paign in Iowa.

After retiring from politics, follow-
ing this campaign, Mr. Smith spent
most of his time at his wmbcr home
in Pasadena, Calif. He died Jan. 12.
1918.

state senate in 1899, where he served
until 1912, During his last few years
in this body, he was chairman pro-
tem of the legislature.

When Albert Cummins made his
campaign for governor, Mr. Smith
took an active part, and was deserv-
ing of much of the credit for the
election of Cummins. This made him
virtually the leader in the state sen-
