The spring formal will be postpone
ed indefinitely, according to an arc
nouncement made yesterday by Will-
iam Bennett, chairman of the recrea-

Because the college ‘calendar is

be some difficulty in filidlng a suit-
able data for the formal. However.
all arrangements havc been made and
tli -e is no doubt that the formal

DR. ERNEST i7. JAQUA

One of the most interesting edllca»
tional projects in (the United States is
that or Ciarcmont colleges, Clams
mont, Calif.

Its plan calls for a group of federa-
ted colleges, each of which stresses
undergraduate work in liberal arts.
In addition, each college i5 prepared
to give graduate work in a graduate
‘instltutlon common to the group. Po-
moi-m college, founded in 1331, and
Scripps college, opened in 1927 com.
pose the undergraduate div ion.

Graduated in lBOl

Dr. Ernest J, Jaqua. '07, for several
years dean of men and assistant to
the president at Grinncll, was taken
from his work as acting president of
[Pomona college to organize the board
of trustees and bEcDme the first presi-
dent of Scripps college.

Under his direction the plans {01‘

A sitxy per cent increase in thc
number of hooks in circulation during-
January and February this year over
the some period in 1932 was noted by
the library officials today.

Economy in the purchase of hooks
by students and the new pro-exami-
nation reading period are believed res
sponsible for this increase in the num—
ber of books loand out to students.

Nearly 14,000 books were issued
during the first two months of this
year. About 9,000 were borrowed
from the library in the same period
in 1932 but more than 11,000 were re-
leased in that time in 1931.

No explanation could be found for
the decrease of books issued during
the two months in 1932 as compared
to the same period in 1931.
