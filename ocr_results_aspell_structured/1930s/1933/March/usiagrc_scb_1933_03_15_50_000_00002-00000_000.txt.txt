DEAD TIMBER

There appears to be a lot of dead timber, ill
the way of Grillllell cllmpus organizations, which
need a general clearing away. -

'Tlle fact is brought to mind by tile recent
postponement of the scheduled meeting of a prom-
inent club, for the fourtll time, because only enough
were present to play it rubber of bridge.

This, however, is not really a fair example of
the inactive organizations whose pills proudly
adorn their members. For, as you have perhaps
noted, the meetings, in this case, were actually
planned—if not attended.

Not mentioning any names—as , tithcrc are
some organizations, still putting their pictures in
the Cyclone, which haven’t averaged one meeting
a month all year.

A lot of tllc blame for this inactivity can be
laid at the door of the members who ignore the
announcement of meetingsibut :1 lot more should
go to the officers who treat their titles as merely
hollornryililther than something which implies ll
duty, or duties, to pcrforlniand do not even call
meetings.

It is apparent tllftt something should be done
to alleviate this condition. Either tllcsc dormant
organizations should sllow some signs of life soon
—or they should be. disbanded.

There are a few active organizations on the
campus which hold meetings regularly and actually
get something done—besides holding an annual
mixed dinner ill the quadrangle dining room.
Needless to say, they are not referred to here,

VARIETY IN READING SHELVES

Frequent criticisms have been heard about tllc
numerous reading Shelves ill the college library.
It is argued that one always finds the some selec
tion of books, with few exceptions. that he is ric-
customcd to Seeing. It is felt by litany students
and others who have occasion to use the library
that these reading shelves could be given more
variety, and thus offer a wider selection.

\Ve have noted this to be true. When we pass
these book shelves on the landing or the racks of
the reading enclosure downstairs, the some old
books meet the view. A treatise on sociel l, a vol-
ume of plays, a book of poems, an autobiography,
and others, perhaps, hails been there since last
September without being changed. If people do
not find these books and certain othcrs interesting,
why not replace them with different ones from
the stock rooms?

Possibly the librarians could rearrange these
shelves each week to provide something new for
Grinncll readers.

—G—

A DANGEROUS INTERSECTION

“Town and gown” form two widely different
groups with varying interests, but sometimes these
interests coincide. Thus a. highway regulation in
the city of Grillncll which might seem to be out
of the realm of student interest, is, we. believe,
very pertinent to our concern.

At the intersection of highway No, 6 with
Park street, the highway begins a, sharp S-curvc.
At night this curve is hard to follow. Several times,
westbound automobiles have bounded over the
curbing at the corllcr of the intersection, narrowly
missing a light-pole and digging deep furrow ' ill
the rcsidencc lawn. East-bound drivers find it a
bit cosicr to follow the curve, because of the high
tel‘l‘ncctl campus, ahcrtd.

A red reflector sign on the northwest corner
of the intersection would warn wcs bound cuto-
iuobilcs that the 0 ye ' more prolonged to the
left, Likcwisc a s‘ nilar gll on the campus zit the
northeast corner would (lid costebound cars, al-
though thc need is less there.

Parents and friends of students driving on high—
way N . 6 through Grillncll at night have often
complained of this intersection. For tllc small cost
of the two reﬂector signs, the Grinncll city council
would prevent much inconvenience and perhaps
a serious accident.

Other Opinions

DEATH—\VITHIN TWO YEARS
(The Midland)

“\Vlthm two years, one—half of you will be dead#
klllcd in a war between America and Japan."

Such was llic alarming and challenging statement
made by Tliouius Que Harrison, traveler and peace work-
cr, in his chapel address Moiitley. Mr. Harrison, who has
been connected with a national peace conference for the
last few years. expressed the firm belief, based on per-
sonal experienec and contacts in the Far East, that war
between Japan and America is inevitable, and that, un-
less steps to promote understanding and peace are taken,
war will issue within two years.

Mr. Harrison, who has spent a great deal of tune in
Japan, advanced the information that militarists now

controlling the govel‘nmenL and press of that country .

are constantly focusing the attention of their country
men on the Hoover-Stimson Doctrine, the Exclusion act
and the presence of the United states fleet in the Pa-
cific, their purpose being to convince the Japanese com-
monality that America is hostile toward Japan and at
the same time to incite hatred toward the United states.

Continued and bitter internal strife between the mill.
tarists and the liberals. or peace group in Japan, has
brought the situation to an acute point, The fire of
propaganda is steadily bringing the hot cauldron of hos—
tility toward America to the boiling point and shortly
only a slight prod will be necessary to send the steaming
contents overflowing upon the unsuspecting and peace
loving American nation.

Should war come, America’s younger geneiauon,
composed in a large measure of college and university
students will be the ones most vitally affected. 0n them
will fall the burden of actual eonnict. For them will
loom battlefields with their bloody shell holes, pitiloss
machine gun fire, verminiand death. And all of it, no
doubt, in the name of a cause very likely understood by
few of those called on to die.

In the light of these facts, it is evident that Ameri-
ca's college group should arouse itself to action. Through
its efforts, beyond a doubt. can be solved the problem of
peaceful relations between America and Japan. From
the American student to the Japanese student must go
the evidence of goodwill and desire for concord—a
movement so strong and sincere as to offset the adverse
attitude now being implanted.

Friendship can avert a war which, for all concerned,
would be a calamity and disaster. The way to friendship
lies within the hands of America's students. While there
is yet time, American students should throw their weigbt
behind a- sincere movement to foster friendship with the
Japanese student group, leaders in the fight against
Japanese militarism.

G—
MADAME SECRETARY
(The Dolly Northwestern)

It is no derogation of the merits of Frances Perkins
to say that there will be a woman in the new cabinet
because the time is ripe for it. Women are permitted to
vote in national elections and it is inevitable that like
other groups they should be recognized by a cabinet
appointment. If Frances Perkins had not been selected
some other capable woman would have been.

The fact that Miss Perkins was made secretary of
labor has another important significance. President
Green of the American Federation of Labor had public.
ly protested when it was announced some time ago that
Miss Perkins was being considered, that she would not
be satisfactory to the federation. Tbe federation bad a
peculiar interest of the office of Secretary of Labor. It
was largely due to the efforts of that body that the post
was created.

Roosevelt’s appointment of Frances Perkins over
the protest of President Green is more important as the
retiring secretary, Mr. Desk, is not a member of the
federation and is also unsatisfactory to it. It would seem
that tbe great days of the unions are in the past, when
it is rebuked successfully by a republican and a demos
oratie president Samuel Gompers must rest uneasy in
his grave.

SHALL DAINTy LEGS BE TROUSEnEm
(The Daily O’Colleg‘ilm)

Women have thrown their skirts into the closet and
are donning papa’s pants, so we see by the comic strips
and Hollywood gossip columns, But we must depend on
these sources of information, for as yet we have seen
none of the trouser-wearers. And despite the shouts of
Garbo and Dietrich followers that a new fashion for
women has come to stay, we remain dubious.

It is dangerous to make predictions about females
and their styles, for the fair ladies refuse to be guided
either by advice or common sense, but the women of the
great interior of America are much slower in adopting
tails than their sisters of the west and east coast. It is
not Paris, New York or Hollywood that makes the
styles, but Podunk, Gopherville and Sloughwash. When
the village stores start handing trousers over the mom
ter to the girl‘s, then the pants fan will have become the
fashion, but until then we refuse to take it seriously.

‘EQUALITY OF WOMEN’
(The Bully Caluornian)

A new deal for women: Due recognition in public
affair no disci-lminations because of sex; equality with
menithat is the ultimate goal.

James A. Farley, chairman of the National Demo-
cratic committee, voiced these opinions at: a. recent
gathering of potential and actual female Satellites. If
Farley was sincere, and was not merely talking in self-
defense, his advocated measures are to be hailed with
delight. university women should be encouraged by the
promise of non-discrimination. and. university men
should be overjoyed. The last medieval traces of chivalry
are lo go. Women who force men out Of work because
of superior ability or lower wages cannot expect those
men to offer their seats in street cars ol- x‘elinquish their
place in line for the “Weaker” sex.

Women who come under the glittering title of gold-
diggera can occasionally expect a hearty poke in the
nose from disgusted men. Men also can expect similar
treatment from women who do not appreciate the preda—
tory advances of unethical swains.

Equality should be established. Men would be
placed on a footing where they can compete with women
without the hindrance of ancient customs that flourished
when women needed protection. What will women think
of equality when they get it?

After having prospered at Tracr
for a number of years, Mr. Clark
again followed his pioneering ine
stinets by going west to Nebraska,
where, at Coleri ge, he established
the first bank in the northeastern
part of the state.

Mr. Clark acquired a considerable
fortune in the banking business, and
made numerous generous gifts of
money to Grinnell college, in which
he was always interested. His only
son, Herman Clark, graduated from
here in 1354, while a daughter was
a member of the class of 1889.

Mr. Clark's memory has been per»
petuated by a picture which adorns
