Whatever evil consequences the

ahouts were caught with very little
change (leaving them really in a sits
uation no different from usual, ex~
cept that now they must undergo the
incredible hardship of cutting down
their daily cigarette consumption to
just one package), they can console
themselves with the thought that the
faculty, and most people. for that
matter, are in the same plight.

Friday Night

Gl‘innell Baritone ls Known

Throughout Nation

Harald Holst, baritone, instructor
in voice, will make an appearance on
the music recital course Friday eve-
ning at 3:00 o'clock in Herrick chap-
el,

Holst, who has often appeared be-
fore Crinnell audiences before, has
studied extensively both in this
country and in Europe. He has re-
ceived many favorable comments on
his concerts.

“Natural Art"

“Throughout. the medium of an art
that was natural and free from af-
fectation, Mr. Holst sang his way to
a well deserved success," says the
Copenhagen Politiken.

Commenting on Holst‘s singing be-
fore the Three Arts club in New
York City, the Three Arts magazine
stated A keen musical sense, equal
facility in French, German, Italian,
and English, combined with some
beautiful ‘be‘l canto singing contribu-
ted to an evening of great pleasure."

‘P'henomonal Base-Baritone

C. E. Watt of the Music News paid
tribute to Holst after his appearance
before an audience in orchestra hall
Chicago. He wrote, “Mr. Holst dis-
played a phenomenal hass»balribone
voice and ease of production."

The works of Beethoven, Mozart,
Bruneau, Schubert, Vaughn-Williams.
Hughes, Walter Kramer, and Harvey
Gaul are included in his varied pro-
gram.

rate, one of the local purveyors of
knowledge of supply and demand and
other economic principles, who, ins
cidentally, has always been opposed
to hoarding, was caught without a
penny in his pockets, and had to
borrow a dollar from his next door
neighbor, who has always boarded
his hard-earned shekels, and who has
been the target of much criticism
from the professor for this reason.

Other faculty members also proved
themselves far from omniscient by
ithe manner in which they permitted
the holiday to cover them with cone
fusion. A certain erudite professor of
English, sojourning in a far—off New
England town, found himself strand—
led with not even enough to buy a

iating expedient of appealing to his
wife to wire him money,

Ercu ‘Mighty’ Affected

Not contenting itself with disturbs
ing the routine of those in humbler
walks of life, the bank holiday did
not disdain to reach up and pluck the
mighty from their pedestals, as evi-
denced by the case of Gov. Pinchot,
of Pennsylvania, one of the richest
men in the country. The governor,
having gone to attend the presiden-
tial inauguration, awoke to find him-
self with the sum of 95 cents. plus
,just enough gasoline to get home.

Perhaps thc most striking example
of the effects of the holiday lleree

gentleman who, it is reputed, had

of his cash in the local stores Friday.

check in his pocket. on his way to
the bank, Saturday morning, to cash
the check, he was prevailed upon to
loan his solitary shekel to someone
.who accosted him. Latest reports
state that he plans to camp on the
steps of his Omaha bank until it
opens.

Mrs. Mary Grinnell Mears
Honored in Naming
of Building

“If we are to have a co-educaticn-
a1 school, there must be a home for
the ladies.” In compliance with this
opinion a new era opened in 1888 for
the women of Iowa college in the
erection of a cottage on the east side
of the campus,

The site which had been the home
of the Rev. J. M, Chamberlain was
donated by its owner for the location
of a boarding house for Grmnell we»
men. June 19, 1888, the cornerstone
was laid for the ncw home and named
in honor of Mrs, Mary Grinnell Mears,
on alumna and interested friend of
the college.

Told of storm

The dedication services included a
few introductory remarks by Pres,
G. A. Gates who reviewed the tragedy
of the storm of 1882 which had been
so destructive to the college buildings
and thanked Mr Chamberlain for his
gift which had become the site of the
new cottage.
