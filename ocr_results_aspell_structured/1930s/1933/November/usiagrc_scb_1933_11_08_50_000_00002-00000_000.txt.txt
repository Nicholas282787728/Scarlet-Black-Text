A DEFINITE POLICY“,l

Disregarding the petition of 393 Grillllell col-
lege students for a longer Thanksgiving vacation,
and the presentation of tllis petition by leaders of
the three student governing bodies on the campus.
the faculty our "culum committee voted Monday to
retain the onceday vacation originally planned.

Is this then the time and place to rise ill our
youthful wrzltll and shout that the principles of
Student goverllllleilt, established long ago on the
Grinllcll campus, are being violated? We tllillk
not. Under the subheading of “Student (loverile
ment“ in the last college catalog, the statement is
made that “students take an active part ill the
government of Grillnell,” The word, ”active.”
tllcn may be construed as meaning little or noth-
ing. so tllat this statelllent is not being disprove
alld as for the sub-lloadillgiwoll, it 'ust llli
leading us so many headlines are.

Fllculty mclnbe From behind the protection
of their sheepskinsi 'e prone to Smile at student
government. Yet it seems that the government l '
the faculty which now exists is often as ra Hating
and as (”ll in its deductions as any student
government might be. ~ Per 'ips the statement is
correct that a vacation at this time “re l seriously
impairs college work between Thanksgiving and
Christmas.” but we would like to see the proof. A
for disrupting an entire week of classes. there
no reason in the world wily faculty members can—
not llold students responsible for preparation of
Monday 1 us if an effort is made and if the stu»
dent who is not prepared is penalized.

If the faculty is about to take a definite stand
in the future on the Thanksgiving vacation, it
should consider all the facts ill the 507 lr-Iudillg
Stlldcllt sentiment. The one-dd \ncation does
nothing outside of allowing the students two or
three free cuts on Thank giving day. The weekend
vacation allo s them to v it their families at the
time of a traditional family holiday, saves the tale
lcge money by reducingr its food bill, and may be
i‘eg’ulr’tled so that it docs not disrupt work serious-
y.

THINK IT OVER

Again the mattcr of tile Pioneer Prudities is
being pr selltcd to men aild women of the college.
Early reports tlli week indicate that halls'alld t t-
tagcs voting on financial bat, ing of the’ project
were favorable but Ilol enthusiastically ,' .

After all, the student body as a whole, has not
been agitating for revival of the rcvuo in the man
nor that it agitated for a longer vacation at
Thank, ii'ing time. Agitation for the Prudities has
been car ,(l on by the Grillilcll chapter of Sin‘llla
Delta Chi. The Scarlet and Bide * and the (lriunell
chapter of National Collegiate Play rs. The student
body as a whole does not. remember the, last pro-
duction of the I’ruditics and is a hit bewildered as
to what ' V all about.

First action this year ill regard to the Prudi-
ties was taken when a student poll revealed senti—
ment of 280 to 73 in favor of the revue, although

approximately 200 students did not vote on the
question at all.

Meeting last week, the dramatic council, in
eoilsidcnllg tllc problem of fillauemg the revue,
decided that halls and cottages should be asked to
furnish the apiece lle sszlry for financing the,
various zit-ts In case thr I'C\'t1t‘, did not prove a ﬁ.

.1] success. \Vllile this showed lorol headed
business sense, it proved to be wretrhcd sales psy-
l-hology so far as the attitude of the student. body
was concerned. ‘If they’re afraid it’s going to
flop, why do they push it?” 'cd one, freshman
when the \nte was taken in h ' hall.

There is no fear on tho pllrt of Sigma Delta
Chi. ilt ltlilst, that the venture. will not he a slim
cuss both ill the w of cutortaimllcnt and finan-
l‘illl return. The urnalistic chapter has gum-all;
(cod that the "9 advanced by each hall and
cottage will be I't‘tlll‘llc(l after the production.

The dranlzltir council also rccnlnlileuded that
tile l'cvdic he produced ill the auditorium of Alum-
lli Reritatioll hall. Members of the Council have
stated that they would prefer presentation ill a
downtown theatre, but were afraid that such a
project could not be financed. However, it has been
discovered that the Iowa theatre may be obtained
For the production at a low cost or a percentage
of the ndm ssiou receipts, and if student backing is
assured. 1('l\ a plan is entirely possible.

All all-college revue, we believe, would he a
tonic to the Grinnell student body. Its unity, its
opportunities for latent talent, its entertainment
value. development of poise alld self confidence,
and its inevitable boost of that intangible quality
termed “spirit,” are well worth the combined cfe
forts of all 1llc students on the campus. \Vith the
backing of all these 0 lidonts. there can be no doubt
that such a revue w h scintillating danc songs,
dialog. costumes, scenery aild light effect. in the
proper surroundings will he a great success.
