STUDENT GOVERNMENT r

. Students of Griilllell whose knowledge of the
high] publicizcd stlidcnt government here was
hazy and incomplete, but who conlplacclltly ac-
cepted tllc theory that their all-powerful govci'ur
ing bodies were being dominated by faculty con-
trol, were informed yesterday of the s functions
of such rule as interpreted by President John
Scllolte Nollcli.

These functions had not been explained or
outlined ill the last four years, at least, and their
exposition was not only startling but a bit coir
fusing to students hearing President Nollcn’s
chapel address, That these functions are not eu-
tircly satisfactory was voiced by the speaker liimr
self, when he declared that “extension of this
democratic control is not impossible, but it may be
inexpedicnt at the present time.”

To thoroughly understand the present prob
lcm, a knowledge of the history of student govern
ment at Grinnell and of workable systems of such
government: at other colleges. is vitally lleccssar ',
and an attempt will be made to present such ill-
formation in the columns of The Scarlet and Black
ill the near future. Ill presenting this information,
we are working on the supposition that students
of Grinllcll ar o’intcrcsted iii developing an efficient
system of goicrllment here and are not content
with nphtllctically and cynically expressing their
discontent with tllc present sy stem.

There are six points ill President Nollcu's out
line of the present functions of student ﬁ’Ol'Cl‘nllICI'III
here. First, “control of life in the dormitories and
quadrangle in consultation with the deans,” is a
function which has been performed by the Council
of House Presidents and Women’s Self Gov lucllt
league, although the phrase, “control of life,” is
too general and misleading to be interpreted as a
specific right delegated to these goi'erni g- bodies.
The second function, “ enforcement of quiet hours,”
is undertaken by hall and cottage presidents and
house councilors in a more or less efficient manner,
dcpending upon the building attitude toward study
ing. The third point, ”sponsorship of social fuller
tions in consultation with the college social coul-
mittcc,” is a phase of student life on any liberal
campus, and is not of peculiar importance here.

In considering the fourth point, “sponsorship
of student publications,” it must be said that,
wllilc students in general do not think of this its
a part of student government, the Grinncll admin-
istration has been particularly tolerant ill regard
to “freedom of the pi ,” as applied to campus
‘puhlications, maintaining n laissez fairc policy so
far as editorial policies are concerned. “Encourage-
ment of honesty ill academic work,” the Iiftllppoint,
is evidently the stop-child of the system, for, so
far as we know, it has never been stressed as a
feature of student government. llcre. Last, “allotr
mcnt of semester fcc funds,” is undertaken each
spring by tllc Student Council, and scen ‘ to be

the only full ion which excuses the cxlstcncc of
such an organization.

There nl't‘ no tooth in the student governing
organization. “Discipline” is definitely delegated
to the faculty, according to President Nollcu,
thereby taking away from -udcilt control such
l‘nilil’t‘l'S as punishment for iolatioll 01' college
rules, or lilliiiitcllauco of . ch ti. ditions as trc.
illall discipline. This latter function may, llawevc
be included under “control of lift: ill the dorm
torics ” illtho the vague nature of, the first point,
prorld - all opportunity [or quibblillg.

Nectwsity for reorganization of the present
system of student government at (lriilllcll ' self-
cyidclit. it’ only to the extent that its functions be
more specit‘ ,ally (lcfiucd. PI'L‘SItlUlli. Nollcll has led
the way by defining the ' lll zl general lllalllml'.

OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE’

There was published recently ill thi
an editorial clipped from the Dail)y O’Collegiml,
student publication of Oklahoma A. and M. Cole
10 ,, clltitlcd "Another Challlpiollship”. The gist
(‘rl Iltt‘ article was that. the Aggics are finding the
caliber of M suuri Valley athletics below their
standard and wish to withdraw ill order to enter .1
league, ill which they can find faster competition.
Apparently, the entire, basis of this outburst was
tllc fact that they have just gained their second
cousccutirc football title. Cert illly the Cowboy
llavc no other builds upon which to claim super-
iority over the 'Vallcy rivals. In basketball and
track, the southern ' have produced no better
than average teams nice they have been members
of tile coiifcrcllcc.

Ful‘tlicrlllo , why should the Oklahomans COIL
sidcr two sue rc championships in football as
conclusive proof: that the nrcrage caliber of His-
souri Valley teams is below their own lciic] 7 Should

COLLEGE JOURNALISTS

(The Daily mini)

A perusal of college newspapers of many different
schools over a period of time would show that the stu—
dent editor frequently falls prey to a. feeling of futility.
He learns that a reformer is never liked whether his
reform is successful or a failure. He finds that he has
a rapid turnover of friendships.

He becomes aware of those mighty barriers—the
smaller mossy-hacked administrative and faculty in-
terests. He frequently is outlawed by the thick-skulled
and the brothers of his fraternity, He knows that few
will care or will long remember his work. He expects
his intentions to he misinterpreted, no matter how ob-
vious the motivation for his acts may he.

He fools like tossing in the towel fifty times in as
many days. He says, “What is the use?" The minute
he gives in to his own inclinations for peace, he places
himself beneath the sod. If he stops and looks over his
problems and troubles in a quizzical fashion, he feels
the old animosity stir Within him and realizes what a
life it would be if some one wouldn’t. disagree and there
were nothing to fight about.

There need be no envy of those college editors who
are flagpole sitters for two semesters and,permit the
rest of the world and even the campus to go by without
molestation. The boys who really have, the fun are those
who never know how long they really have their sealps.
who laugh and defy the higots and moth-eaten vested
interests, who openly flaunt the epitaphs which have
been written for them in advance, and who take mat-
ters seriously without becoming overly serious. There
is an art in raising the hornets and doing it so well
that they have no comeback.

Most of the esteem accorded the active college edi-
tor is worth considerable less than the hatred he gathers.
He usually has a few staunch friends who are large
enough to overlook his rashncss, a faux pas now and
then, the seemingly insane and meaningless news or edi-
torials he sometimes prints and his somewhat blind ad—
herence to his own peculiar code.

“Government rests on responsibil»
ity, and responsibility alone carries
authority,” declared Dwight Camp-
bell, president ol the Student Coun
cil. He explained that there was a
general misconception of the pur»
pose, responsibility, and authority of
the student government, and that
there was no aILernatch but to am
cop: the fact that it was definitely
limited,

Using the petition for an extenr
sion of the Thanksgiving vacation
as an example, he went on to say
that the students have a right to
petition but the final authority lies
in the faculty for it has the ultimate
responsibility, and if the student
government is in conflict with the
faculty, the decision of the faculty
must rule.
