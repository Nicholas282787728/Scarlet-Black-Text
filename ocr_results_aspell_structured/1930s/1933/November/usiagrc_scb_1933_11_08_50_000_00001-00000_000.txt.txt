Methodist Pastor Delivers
Sermon at Vespers Sunday

“The value of life is determined
within us and not without. Its values
are determined subjectively and not
objectively," stated the Rev. H. s.
Wilkinson of the Grinnell Methodist
church in his talk at Vespers, Sun-
day, Nov. 5.

“We must not be disturbed by the

scientist, who is making such alarm-
ing discoveries," he continued. Re-
ligion deals with facts, Dr. Wilkin-
ison asserted. and life should be
llived Within these facts rather than
outside them.
The speaker concluded with the
,appeal that everyone should find
'time to go to quiet places and ”tune
out” the outside disturbances and
listen to the Lord.

ion of the average French citizen.

of French revealed in discussing the
topic, “Ideas of the People on the
Streets of France on International
Relations”, at the latest meeting of

that they owe the United States :Io
debt, considering what America paid
as no more than its just share to-
‘ward the allied cause,

Although the sentiment against
war is very strong among thc French
Veteran associations, the citizens
feel justified in their preparations
tor a defensive war, Seivei- stated.
The French- fear that Germany is
sccrctly arming for an offensive war.

tween Germany and Italy. both of
which are hostile to it, armament ap»

eyes of the average Frenchman, the
speaker continued.
