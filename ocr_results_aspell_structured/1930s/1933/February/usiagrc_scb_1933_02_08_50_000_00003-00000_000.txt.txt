Science and Religion

, When asked how a college gradu-
te wholhas majored in science may
.dopt a definite religion for himself
and reorganize his faith in case it
has been somewhat shaken, Dr. Pauck
replied, “There has never been a cone
tradiction existing between science
and religion. The only difficulty I
can see is that theological doctrines
have heen expressed in an outlived
scientific view. Theology is not al-
ways a religion, and it is dangerous
if it absolutizes the knowledge of
cience. _

“Religion is much more than a
orld View. It is a certain impetus
r enthusiasm in living. This is the
. caning which should he taken by
veryone, whether he he a student
f arts, music, or science. lt‘ is very
rue that the world was not created
n seven days but this does not mean
hat religion is disqualified. Although
he old theory of the existence of
he soul may he hard to define," cons
inued Dr. Pauck, “immortality is
omething which no science can ever
ouch."

' church Must Retrench

In discussing the present economic
ituation in relation to the church.
r. Pauck stated that if the depres—
ion continues, the effect upon the
hurch will be twofold “First, eco~
oinic failure will make people turn
ore and more toward the church
r support as they have in the past
nd as they are heginning to do now.

“Secondly, the church will have to
hange its program; that is, it must
