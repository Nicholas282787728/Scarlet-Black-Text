Pauck Sees I
Need for New
Church Move

Theologian Delivers Third
Gates Lecture in Chapel
This Morning

A new theological movement that
declares God is at the borderline of
of all human existence and is every—
thing man wants to be, but is not, is
believed by Dr. Wilhelm Pauck, pror
fessor of church history at Chicago
Theological seminary to be the path
to recovery from the present social

A and religious crisis in which we havel
found ourselves. l

This was expressed by him in the
third Gates lecture on “God and Re-
ligion" given this morning in Here
rick chapel before a large delegation
of Congregational ministers, college
students, and faculty members.

Promises Solution

Dr, Pauck analyzed the historical
background leading up to the pres
ent social crisis in his lecture on the
“Crisig of Our Western Civilization"
Tuesday morning in Herrick chapel.
Last night at 8 o'clock he discussed
"The Religious Crisis" and promised
to give the solution to the situation
in today's talk. ‘

Citing the rise of Karl Barth,
young German preacher and relig»
ious scholar in popularity among the
young theologians of Germany,
France, Spain, Netherlands, and
other European nations, Dr. Pauck
explained how the fundelnentalists,
humanists, modern protestants could
no longer defeat the cri s with their
respective methods.

Crisis in Atheism

"Atheism and other forms of
secularism have become pol' ical pow-
ers in the world, and therein lies the
crisis.H

”Saint Francis saved religion dur-
ing the crisis of the crusade period.
Martin Luther saved religion during
the Reformation, but there was no
argument used then that will defeat
the powerful hold of secularism toe
day." believes Dr. Pauck,

People Want Answer

“Because God is an answer to the
meaning of life, the people will leave
the church with a new spirit after
listening to a preacher of the Earth.
ian school,” believes the speaker.
“People want an answer to their
questions after the meaning of life
and because God hovers all their
lives containing the answer to that
question they will return to the
church and continue to return," cone
eluded Dr. Pauck.

Dr. Pauck will give the two final
lectures of his series on “The Chris
tian and the Modern Crisis," tonight
at 3 o’clock, and tomorrow morning
at 9:40, in Herrick chapel.

Olympic Movie,
Boxing Feature
Honor G Stag

By Marvin Teget

“When the girls are away, the boys
will have a Stag." so sayetb the
Honor G club which is sponsoring a
big program for the benefit of the
gentlemen whose best girls have de-
serted them to play George or Martha
at the Colonial Ball. There will be
no need to sit at home and be sad,
they promise, for there will be plenty
of fun for everyone

Although the main part of the en—
tertainment will consist of films of the
high peaks of the Tenth Olympiad
held in Los Angeles last summer,
probably the most popular feature of
the whole program will he the intra-
dormitory boxing matches between
the champions of the various halls
chosen in house meetings.

Drawings will he made at the party
to determine who will box who, and
judges will he selected, to decide upon
the winning boxer. A suitable prize
(norduroys or cash i will be the prop
erty of the winning boxer. other
features of the program, although
tentative at present, include a van»
triloquist act by Joe Conard and
some tumbling work by Aksel Nielsen.

The small admission which will be
charged is to he turned into a benefit
fund for track men so that they may
complete their schedule.

Lyons Makes

Shrew Human

Cllicaglo Dramatist Reads

Shakespearean Play

The transformation of a bitter,
sarcastic woman with a penchant for
throwing things, to a docile wife who
obeys her husband's every wish, was
smoothly effected by Dr. M. Cather—
ine Lyons, dramatist, who read
Shakespeares “Taming of the
Shrew,” Monday evening in Herrick
chapel.

Given as a regular number on the
Grinnell college lecture course, the
feature attracted one of the largest
student-audiences to attend the lec-
ture series for some time,

No Text Used

Miss Lyons, former actress and
present instructor at the Maclcan
School of Speech in Chicago, pore
traycd the many and varied cbarac-
ters with animation and grace. There
was nothing of the flowery elocu-
tionist about her character bits,

Synopses of irrelevant portions of
the play were given by MISS Lyons,
but the main action was portrayed
fully without the use of a text. The
reader’s clear voice and distinct dies
tion were easily understandable in
all parts of the chapel. A wide range
of tones made interpretation of both
men and women characters easy to
follow.

While all characters were clean-
cut, the parts of Pctrucbio, the
swashbuckling hero and Katharina,

Dr. Steiner Recovers
From M a jar Operation

According to a telegram received
by Richard Steiner, his father, Dr.
E. A. Stciner, professor of applied
Ch ianity, is resting well after a
successful major operation at Johns
Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, Md,
Monday,

Mrs. Steiner is in Baltimom with
her husband and they plan to sail
for Palestine as soon as Dr. Steiner
has recovered.

Grade Change

Present System Assailecl by
Governing Body

A more satisfactory arrangement
of the present grading system will
he sought by a committee appointed
by the student council Sunday. Miss
Bethana McCandless, registrar, will
be interviewed by the committee re-
garding the change.

The present system of giving stu-
dents only the grades of “satisfac-
lm'y” or “poor" was inaugurated
here last term following student
agitation in regard to the matter.
Grades of A, B, or c are substituted
for “satisfactory," and grades of D
or E for “poor" are sent out only
after the term has ended.

The council also decided that sets
urday afternoon tea dances will now
be held when the recreation commit.
tee thinks it advisable.

Decision to petition the chapel
committee to make advance an-
nonncements of chapel programs was
reached by the council, and also to
petition the faculty to allow seniors
to have their examinations limited to
comprehensive reviews in their ma-
jor and minor subjects only.

Spanish Students l’irevented
From Enrolling This Year

Charles Suarez and Elias Ason
Galban, Spanish students who were
reported to be entering Grinnell col-
lege this semester, will not do so un.
til next fall, according to a telegram
received today by college authorities,

It was believed here previously that
Galban was a Cuban, and Suarez, a
Spaniard, but latest reports are that
both men were born in Spain, and for
that reason are affected by immigra-
tion restrictions.

Because of the fact that the men,
who live in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, are
not Cuban citizens, it has been re-
ported that the American consul at
Havana would not approve their air
plication for admittance to the United
States. Both, however, plan to be
here next fall.

Blair hall, rendezvous for 'ncid

a century, is one of the most ancient
buildings on the campus and for this

Blair hall received its name from
John 1. Blair, a Blairstown, N. J.

The building was constructed upon
the foundation of old ‘Grinnell col-
lege', which was destroyed by the
cyclone of 1882. This ‘Centri‘il Cole
lege', one of Llle three buildings of
old iowa college, was also a science
building and Blair hall continued the
tradition.

For several ycars, the room on the
first floor which now serves as :1
Chemistry [white room, and the read-
ing room directly north of the lec-
ture room, were used as the chapel.

One of the interesting features of
the building is the museumione of
the finest in any college the size
of Grinnell. It was Started by H. W.
Parker, former professor of natural
history, in the 'Old East College-
which burned in 1870. The second
attempt was made in Central Col-
lege' which was destroyed in the
cyclone and the third attempt was
made in Blair hall, and remains tar;

twill offer two conference games and
a non-league game.

Friday night, the pioneers will

urday, they will journey to Indianap-
olis for a return tilt with Butler uni»

day they will play Washington unl-
versity, of St. Louis.

Coach John C. Truesdale announc-
ed that he would take a squad of
ten men on the trip, but has not yet
made his selections.

Ullrich Will Not Play

Due to an injury received in the
Oklahoma game last weekend, which
is thought to have developed into a
rupture, Dick Ullrich, vcteran guard
will not make the trip.

His place was taken by Les Manna,
smooth working junior, in the games
last week, and after the unusual
ability that be displayed, he will un-
doubtably handle the berth for the
brace of games. Santi, who, although
guarding men much taller than he.
so far this season, has been probab»
ly the most consistent player on the
Grinnell squad. With Santi and
Monns holding down the back part
of the floor, the defensive situation
is probably as well taken care of as
possible.

Phelps Eligible Again

Dick Phelps, who had been ineli-
gible for several games prior to the
Oklahoma battle, will be available
for the center berth on the excursion,
allowing Duncan to return to his old
place at forward. Phelps displayed
a great deal of improvement in the
games last week, overcoming his old
fault of fumbling the hall. and will
probably be of great use to the five
in the games this weekend.

The Pioneers now have a victory
column of three games and have
dropped seven, but after their reverse
in tactics last week, it is hoped that
they can again score an upset. In the
game with Butler earlier in the sea-
son, Grlnncll battled on fairly even
terms until the final minutes. when
they dropped the game by a wide
margin,

In pl~actice_ this week, Truesdale
has been working on plays, and
scrimmaging against the freshman
Squad, using Mimns and Santi at
guards, McMillin, Mason, and Dun-
can at forwards, and Phelps at cen-
ter.
