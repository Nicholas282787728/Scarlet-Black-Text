FOR THE STUDENTS, BY THE STUDENTS

College editors collie and go, each with h
own ideas of news values, editorial policies, and
makeup. Today, The Scarlet and Black is undcl'-
going its annual transformation.

Obviously, tlle primary purpose of a news-
paper, so far as its news columns are conccrllcd,
is to present np-to-date,‘ accurate stories, interests
ingly written in correct grammar fllld style, coll-
cerning all happenings and topics of special
interest to its readers. That is a pretty large order.

It is the goal, however, at which tllis paper
will aim under the leadership of its ncw manage-
ment. \Vc believe that students subscribing to :l
student newspaper are entitled to know the truth
about affairs pertaining to their interests. \Vc also
believe that the latest developments on these af-
fairs deserve more space ill news columns than do
earlier developments. \

To announce a cut and dried editorial policy
at this time would be foolish, considering ullexpcc
ed situations which develop each year. Howevc .
we shall continue to work toward elimination of
ltnlyessary and inactive organizations on the
campﬁE {the advance announcement of chapel pro
grams; 11 successful Pioneer Pruditics next year,
and a strong but sane student government. Other
matters will present themselves ill turn.

In relation to the third nlattcr—maltcnpg
readers may not be particularly interested. It is
the policy of The Scarlet and Black, however, to
endeavor to arrange its material in ll pleasing and
correct manner, conformillg with rules of balance
and display.

We are lnflhing no prollliscs of acllicvelncnts,
nor does the management take itself so seriously
that it is sure it can live up to all of its HSDll‘r’lr
tions Nevertheless, we shall try. And let it not
be for ottcn that this is a student newspaper,
welcoming suggestions and comments from its

readers.

OUTSIDE THE LINE

Freshman probation days provide a ticlilisll
p'oposition fur llppcrclhssmcll to handle. In the
first place, there are those who believe ill no form
of prepping, whatsoever, ft few who believe that
all freshmen should be paddled into submission,
and an intermediate group which favors moder-
ation and believes that both props and upper-
classmcll shollld enjoy the period, with rigorous
llleosures being administered only to those who
will absolutely not conform to llzlll and campus
discipline.

This third group seems to have the right slant
on the problem. Stunts and weird costumes pro-
vide a harmless outlet for the inherent exhibition-
ism ill every human being. Most freshmen remem-
ber this type of prepping as one of tllc high-lights
of their college careers.

Yet there are limits to the intermediate type
of prepping. Yesterday, a stunt which violated
good taste was devised by one of the halls. With
the present trend toward barn-yard humor ill
magazines, moving pictures, stage productions, and
literature, we believe that only a. few of the one
lockers, perhaps, were actually shocked. However,
the larger part of the spectators appeared shecpish
and embarrassed, as did the freshman who was
selected for the act. Men avoided meeting the eyes
of coeds, and snickercd sclfrconsciously.

That sort of thing may be all right for bur-
lesque shows or rillald lung lo We conic. that
we were among thosc who ll cl not shocked. Honu
evcr, we did feel a hit like Swift’s Gulliv l- after
some of his more ill ‘th01‘ experiences.

Here are three opinions on the relationship of legal
beer to college campuses. . . .

TEST non COLLEGES
(Rider College News)

College students and administrators are facing an
important problem. Legalization of 3.2 per cent beer
has been effected by congress, and the question now
arises as to what regulations, if any, will be found
necessary orvdésirahle in the nation's several college
communities.

No sensible person would be so naive as to believe
that there has been no drinking among college men
during the prohibition era. But the truth is that most
of this drinking has been of the subrosa variety, a
fact which has tended to keep it somewhat out of
sight. limo",

Legal beer, however, will drag the whole problem
out into the open. With the establishment of authorized
drinking places, hitherto illicit beverages will enjoy
good standing and will be much more readily available
than they have been since 1920.

It behooves students and administrative officials
alike to promote the ideals of rational temperance and
reasonable restraint from the very start of the new
experiment. Education should develop Self-control. And
people may well look to the colleges for an example
of steady conduct in any period of social change.

A supreme effort should be made on every college
campus. within the weeks immediately ahead, to dis-
courage thoughtless excesses, and reckless celebrations.
The college reaction will be watched closely and critiCA
ally. It is squarely up to the American student to show
that he has a level head.

RETURN OF BEER
(Tulane Tunnbaloo)

“Welcome beer, repeal won't be long now, and then
we'll have prosperity." This is a, possible reaction that
the “rah rah" type of collegian might be expected to
manifest when he becomes conscious that this popular
beverage has returned. Since he has been exposed to
college for some time, he might even think and add a
soft ugood-bye hypocrisy."

Although it is a well known fact that beer will
not restore prosperity although it may assist a tem-
porary boom in business and that repeal has been put
many months farther off by the return of this easily
drinkable. if slightly intoxicating liquid, the farewell
to hypocrisy seems to be something most favorable.

When beer returns. many evils of the present will
become non-existent. No longer will persons wanting a
little drink have to slip off and hide to satisfy this
desire. Another unenforceable law will have become
obsolete. What is now a racket will become a legal
enterprise. The need for a double standard of personal»
ity will be eliminated. These tendencies toward hypoc-
risy at last will be made an impossibility, where before
they were forced upon the majority of people.

Although there have been no official reports as to
the action that Tulane will take, reports from other
institutions are favorable. The colleges, obviously to show
that they were maintaining their standards of repre-
senting the broad point of view, are allowing the sale
of beer on the campuses. In New Orleans, not only
colleges but some of the high schools are acceding to the
demands of their students and the principles of liberal-
ity.

Leaving the choice of drinking to the students and
not hindering its accessibility to those that want it,
indicates that these schools recognize the independence
of the individual under the democratic theory of gov-
ernment. This firmly places the responsibility on each
individual for his action. Which seems, until the present
setup of society is radically changed, the only reasonr
able course.

As yet is has not been announced that beer will be
sold on the campus, and that students who prefer it
to a soft drink will be able to get it. However. this an-
nouncement undoubtedly will be forthcoming shortly.
Meanwhile Tulane waits anxiously.

BEER AT COLLEGE
(By College News Service)

On many a campus throughout the United States
this week the question of whether to give such college
tunes as the Maine "Stein Song” a newer and perhaps
truer meaning was the subject of much discussion.

In those states where legalized beer was being sold,
college authorities were debating as to the feasib' 'ty
of allowing beer to be sold on the campus and by Stu-
dent concessions. In few cases was such permission
specifically granted, and direct orders were issued at
several leading institutions, including Columbia univer-
sity and the University of FennSylvnnia, against the sale
of any alcoholic beverages on any part of the campus.

Many pleas were filed with officials of ecrtain
colleges by students who asked that they be allowed
to order beer with their meals when purchased in stu-
aent-operated dining rooms, but for the most part these
pleas fell on deaf ears.

However, this did not prevent many Greek houses
from serving—or at least condoning the drinkingiof
legalized beverages, and there was nothing to prevent
students in most cases from obtaining beer at off-
campus restaurants and other sales places.

At the University of Michigan, Dr, Warren E. Ford
sythe, director of the university health service, issued
a warning to students against excessive beer drinking.

“The return of legal and cheaper beer will be a
challenge to the good sense and self-control of our stll»
dent’s," he said. "From past observations and a know»
ledge of the pyschologieal action of alcohol, one cans
not help but fear that student health is going to be

Wittler Talks to Students
Planning Practice Teaching

A meeting was held Thursday eve-
ning- for those members of the ctlllcar
tion classes who wish to obtain praCr
ticc teaching periods for the next
school year.

Milton Wittler, assistant professor
of education, asked the students to
arrange their schedules for the next
semester keeping in mind the per--
iods available for practice teaching,
Also (1. E. Humphrey, superintendent
of ci-irincll schools, has suggested a
course in creative writing which
English majors were asked to con-
skier.

“Prospective teachers are
fortunate in being able to obtain
experience through the
present cooperative system with
Grinnell schools", Mr. Wittler he-
lioves. “The system is likewise ad-
vantageous to the city schools since
they are able to give courses in Ger-
man, Spanish and French without
cost to the taxpayers, by utilizing
the aid of modern language major-s
from the college.
