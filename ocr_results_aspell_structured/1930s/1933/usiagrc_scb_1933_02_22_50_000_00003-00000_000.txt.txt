WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1933.

By Max Itoss

Grinnell college may now point
with pride to what is without doubt
the finest swirmm'ng team in the his-
tory of the school. Alter Winning the
midwestern A. A. U. chmmpiunship,
and soundly trouncing Coach Pete
Wendell's Creighton university tank
team, the Pioneer mermen added the
strong Iowa State team of Jake nau-

bert to their list of victims.

The Cyclones were not easy pick-
ings. Holding the Big Six crown from
last year and easily the favorite to
win it again this season, Iowa State
was expected to win the meet, Coach
Rosen's men gradually swept into the
lead, however, and it was beyond the
power of the Big Six champs to over-
come that lead. Iowa State won both
relays and the diving, hut in the in.
dividual races, they could only win
one first out of six.

o a s

Richard Murphy, A. A, U. champ-
ion, won the 440»yard free style, but
Dare hmbrough, Grinnell sensational
sophomore swimmer, pulled an upset
to beat him by 10 leet in the 220i
hinlbrough also won the backstroke,
Bob Adams and Bud Teget fhiished
almost neck-endured: in the 60 and
100 yard dashes, easily garnering
first and second in each race.

1 r .

Clark Elbert pulled another sur-
prise when he beat Sands, crack Cy-
clone breaststroke artist, and in addi-
tion got a second in the 440 and third
in the 220, Coach Rosen concentrated

,smcnglh wisely in the individual _,

events by keeping his best men out
of the relays, Two weeks ago, both
the ion-yard relay and the dooeyard
medley outfits were victorious over
the Ames swimmers in the A. A. U.
meet.

Bill Parzybok put in a busy week-
end Alter playing more than half of
the Drake basketball game Friday
night, he journeyed north with the
track team to vault against the Cyv
clone tracksters. That over, he en-
tered the diving competition in the
Iowa state-Grinneu swimming meet,
performing in good style to nose out
Felse oI lowo State by one-third o!
a point He had had no practice in
either the vaulting or diving compe-
tltion.

e

Bob Morgan, another member of
the basketball squad, pulled a strong
man stunt by making the trip with
the track team to Ames. He tossed
the shot 40 feet 4 inches on his first
attempt and took second place in
that event. Snap James, state indoor
champion, like Morgan, has had little
opportunity to practice and conse»
quently James leap of more than 20
feet, although he took off fully
twelve inches behind the board, is a

noteworthy performance.

Josie, the lovely trapeze artist. stands upon a small platform.
At the will of the magician she leaps twenty feet into the air
to reach her trapeze. She uses no ropes. no ladder! A plie-
nomenal [tap for awoman . . 4 or a man!

EXPLANATION :

Josie didn’t jump . . . she was spruny! The twenty-foot leap
is not dependent on Josie’s ability, but on a powerful spring
mechanism hidden beneath the stage which propels the artist
upward through the air. The force is so violent that the lady
wears a light steel jacket which protects her from injury as
she starts her astonishing leap.
