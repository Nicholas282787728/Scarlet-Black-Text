Grinnell Victory Chances
Slim at Iowa University

Tourney Saturday

Grinnell, Iowa State, Drake and
University of Iowa will compete in
the annual indoor quadrangular track
meet at the Iowa fieltlhouse Satur-
day night. All of the teams have met
in dual meets this season.

Iowa State holds the advantage
this season, having defeated each of
the three teams. while Grinnell
lost contests to each of them. Grin-
nell is expected to be the strongest
in the distance events, especially
since the mile run will he a team
event and will be scored as in cross-
country. Ctr-captain Mike Pilbrow
has won the two-mile run in each of
the previous meets this season and
will be expected to repeat the victory
in the meet Saturday,

Drake Strong in Dashes

Drake sprinters hold the advantage
in the clashes. Walter stillwell, hur -
ler, and Frank Smith in the Gﬂryartl
dash. have not been defeated this
season. Paul Schneeman. Fred
Blanck, shot put. and Carol Johnson,
pole vault. are also undefeated in
their events so far this season.

Last year the Iowa team finished
in first place while the Pioneers rank-
ed second, and according to records
so far this season, it seems likely
that the order of the finish will be
completely reversed.

Because of the influenza epidemic
the Pioneers‘ chances for Victory are
greatly lessened, At the present time
Harold Anderson, sophomore quarter
miler and a member of the mile re-
lay team, is the only member of the
squad afflicted, His absence from the
mile relay team will be greatly felt,
as it was shown in the recent meet
against Drake.

Science
is Interrupted;
Kitten Lives

“Fools go where angels fear to
trend," and so a tiny grey kitten
which wandered nonchalantly into a
zoology class last week had little
fezlr or knowledge of what its fate
might be,

Miss Betty Blagg, instructor,
pauscd in her lecture. “Cat,” she said,
"You're courting death."

The kitten strolled under a row of
chairs and was snatched from the
floor by Elizabeth Colleic, who hid
the animal uudcr her coat in an air
tempt to halt the advancement of
science. Suppressed msows, however,
revealed the culprit and the kitten
was taken to the basement where
many a feline has met his doom.

Various tests of the animal’s do-
mesticity and suscepti 'llty to petting
proved that the kitten, at one time.
had had a home, so it was released.
Four times during the week, how-
ever, students brought the some little
grey kitten to the laboratory, so that
it might be dissected for the good of
science, and four times Instructor
Blagg sot the creature free.

Miss Blagg admits that she has
dissected n number of cats in order
‘to show zoology students the work-
ug parts of such chordata, but she
in sts that onlv stray cats are used
for that purpose. In relieving such
cats of their ninc lives, Miss Blagg
boll vcs that she is being humane,
for many of thc strays am thin and
starved.

Meanwhile the kitten has taken up
residence in Cottage Four,

tories.

uled this week, will be postponed,
however, until next weck, according

clude the spring formal dance planned
for Saturday, the recital by the Gor~

Caused by Streptococcus
Forty-four men remained ill this
morning but many were recovering.
All but four men were to be released
from the hospital before tomorrow,
According to physicians in charge.
the epidemic was caused by the pyo-
genic streptococcus germ, which pro-
duces such diseases as pharyngitis.
rhinitis and laryngiti-s rtumors that
meningitis had been discovered here
are absolutely fal, , according to
physicians.

Many rumors were spreading about
the campus this morning. In denying
them, physicians stated that there is
no prospect of a quarantine or of dis
continuing classes further. A laborer

no trace of meningitis.

hospital yesterday and no new pa-
tients have been admitted since Mons

31 trays were prepared for patients,

epidemic was that it did not spread
to the quadrangle. Eleven women are
confined in the infirmnry with ordin-
ary colds, but no traces of the throat
infection have been found there, Three
women were reported with high tem—
peratures this morning.

Today a report spread through the

closed, but Mrs. L, V. Phelps, dean of
women, inimcdiatcly contradicted it.
