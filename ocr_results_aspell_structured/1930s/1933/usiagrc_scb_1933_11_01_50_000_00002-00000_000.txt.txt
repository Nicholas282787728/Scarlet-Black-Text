AN INTERNATIONAL FORGE

Among the measures which sonic interests
wish the League of Nations to perfect is an intcrr
national “police force” to take care of all dis—
putes which need settlement by physical means.
This force of mm would lint rcprcscnt any one
nation, but the entire confederation of national
statcs, and would stand ready to chastizc any
member of the group which became obstrcperous.

The main drawback to tllc Scheme, as onc
Grinnell history professor expressed it, is that all
the men ill the world are “national,” not “inter-
national.” “If we could call down a race of intelu
nationals from the sky," he declared, “they could
be pressed into Scivice vcry satisfactolilv ”

Imagine such an international folce composed
of Gcllnan. English, French, and Japanese soldiers.
If the League sliould desire to maintain order in
Germany, say, the German division of the force
wollld bc a lely unsatisfactory aid to the remain»
der of the company in marching against the Father
land

Considered ‘All a whimsical light, such a police
force, if maintained over a long period of time,
might in the third or fourth generation assume an
international aspect, providing that its melnllers
.intcrmarricd with various nationalities, and that

the homes of the members were lnaintaincd ill a,

neutral country such as Switzerland.

Yet from the practical viewpoint such a ma-
chine of enforcement does not Sccln a likely possi-
bility. The League cannot do its work by forcei
it needs intelligent co-operation.

UNCLE FREDERICK

In “Aunt Polly’ s Stoiy of Mankind” by D. 0.
Stewart there is an interesting picture of cv olution.
Aunt Polly thinks of the evolutionary process as
the ascent from the nasty amoeba to Uncle Frcd~
crick triumphantly standing at the top of the long
and tortuous course in it Prince Albert with one
glovcd hand resting on the First National Bank
and the other on the Presbyterian Church. There
he Stands, the symbol of progrcss not just to Aunt
Polly but to a surprisingly large number of people
everywhere.

One characteristic of Uncle Frederick is his
stability. He is a pillar of community life, the sym-
hol of respectabil His motto is one freqllclitlv
hcald in certain classes at Grinncll “Be not the
first on whom the new is tried be not the last to
lay the old aside.”

Now Uncle Frederick docs represent a certain
sort of solidarity, alld so does the motto on which

he builds his life, but this sort of solid: ity . dia-
lnctlicalll opposed to human pl cg It is a \cly
snug nay fol a \ y oldillalv individual to float
along with the (nricllt and mold discomfort 0]
embarrassment but for sotiet' t spells stagnation

to Rolnc u as made up of just such people; every
growillrv , iIizatioll has bccn charged with pcoplc
who had the courage to take chances, who were
not afraid of being tho. fi 1. on whom the 11er
was tried. “'0 do not first stndl' the. alt of tlic

for he had I’ st studied, hut with all study there
was uncertainty still. Ilc tool: a chance.

Perhaps society rcqllircs a few men like Uncle
Frederick. lint certainly it ilcods men like Pllidias
and Columbus too. “70 may fail as hundreds of
artists and explorers Illll'c faili‘d, hut 1h mild

A QUESTION OF POLICY

This Ilnllowc’cll SPiISOII has found the llt‘w
papers of the country haunted by a VOI
hon ill the question of liquor advcr lg.
with tho colldclilllation of a considerable number nl'
tllt‘ll' dvcrtiscrs on one hand, and tempted by very

lucrative offers from the liquor interests on tho :

other. the papers are placed ill zl genuinc dilemma.

It has been interesting to observe the action
taken upon the question by various influential
plllllicatiolls. In a number of instances. thcil' altie
ludcs have been the subject of much Sui-1 iscd ('Oiii-
lllcut. \thn the New Talk Tinics. chalactclizcd

would respond to the ovcrtnrcs of the lllanuf'a tult

was later cmpll‘nsizod when the Chicago Tribune,
admittedly a “wet" publication during the Vol-
stead cra, inserted a full page advertismnent all-

lg that it would accept no contracts to ad

The whole scheme will be complicated to an
even greater degree after next IVcdnesdal‘ when,
to all appearances, plohib on will receive
death blow as the. tliii'ty- Sl\tli State holds its poll

made by the national govclnlilcut tn gov crn liquol
advertising after the passing of the Volstcad act.
Up to IIIC present. the advertising copy has been
required to read "if and when prohibition is 1‘6-

the plohlcln of policy after the ncccssary national
legislation on liquor advcltisillg has hccn complct:

rect influence on the amount of advertising which
they will I‘CCGII'O from othcr sources in the future.

A committee headed by a Grinnell college professor ,
recently successfully protested the placing of a large .

cannon in a prominent place of permanent display at
Grinnell. Just why a smug shiny cannon should he in-
cluded as ”suitable lawn decoration” along with flower
beds, bird oaths, statuary, and sun-dials is not entirely
clear out it is a custom that has gained some promin-
ence as almost any home town court house lawn will
Show. Perhaps it presagcs a time when the only place
considered proper for cannons is the glass case of a
