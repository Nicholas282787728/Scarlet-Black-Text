Dudley, Sinex,

in Premiere

Cast Repeats Performance
of ‘Meet The Wife’
This Evening

With outstanding charactrizations
portrayed by May-Floyd sinex, John
Dudley and Maurice Birdsall, the
homecoming play, “Meet the Wife,"
three—act comedy by Lynn Starling,
was presented before a capacity
crowd Friday evening in the auditor-
ium of Alumni Recitation hall.

The second performance of the pro-
duction is scheduled tonight at s o’-
clock,

Shows Unity

Not only plot, but costuming and
setting, worked into a harmonious
whole, centered about the plans of
Gertrude Lennox—portrayed by Miss
Sinexethe attractive, but affected
and impractical wife of Hervey Len-
nox. Both Miss Sinex and Mr. Bird-
sall, as victor stauntin, ineffectual,
wouldrbe husband of Doris Lennox,
‘vivified their characters effectively,
with some over-playing. .

Mr. Dudley‘s performance was per-
haps the most outstanding last night.
He showed poise, self—confidence, and
graciousness, rounding out his char-
acter of Philip Lord, English novel-
ist. after the manner of H. B, War-
ner of the stage and screen

Park Plays Journalist

King Park gave a realistic char-
acterization of Gregory Brown, typi-
cal newspaper reporter, while John
Pooley characterized Harvey Lennox,
the unimaginalive small»business man.
Gertrude‘s subordinated husband,
with an ability showing considerable
promise.

Ruth Crabb. as the ingenue, Doris
Bellamy, Gertrude's subordinated
daughter, characterized well an ex-
tremely emotional girl without ina
genuity or resourcefulness. Leona
Chisholm and Keith Palmer portrayed
the antagonistic maid and superior
butler with success.

The setting carried out attractively
the orange and rose of Miss Sinex'
costumes. and the costumes of the
other characters blending in tone
with hers.

Plans Frustrated

The plot is concerned with the lilti-
matc frustration of Gertrude’s plans
for the lives of her associations. Her
supposedly deceased husband, Philip
Lord, reappears, after winning slice
cess as an English novelist, and her
daughter, Doris, with her father's
help spurns marriage to Victor staun-
ton with a "background," and mam
rice the obscure but promising neWS-
paper reporter, while Harvey, Gert»
rude'S second husband, intimates that
with the aid of a fictitious death he,
too, might be able to rise to fame as
Lord had done without Gertrude‘s

subjugating influence.
act the Wife" showed a finish
born of many patient hours of re-
hcarsing and tireless effort on the
part of producer, players, and pro-
duction staff. Cues were taken up
promptly, and little or no prompting
was necessary. Makeup was well

done, cspeciaiy in the case of Miss,

Sincx, whose character demanded a
mature aspect, artfully and artificialr
ly kept young.
Hal-monlous

Costuming was carried out with
careful consideration to the slightest
detail of harmony and fitness. Rose
and orange were the chief color notes,
artfully blended in setting and cos-
tuming, even to Birdsall's pink tic.

The setting for this play is another
noteworthy achievement considering
the limited space available on which
to arrange a rather complicated
scene. It was complete and convinc-
ing, in excellent arrangemcnt and
color harmony.

Speaker Cites
Pioneer Vision

Honorary Honor G Pins
Awarded in Chapel

"The high position which Grinnell
holds today among colleges and uni-
versities is due in no small way to
the vision of the pioneers,” declared
John W. Cannaway, professor of
political science, in an address at the
homecoming chapel services this
morning in Herrick chapel.

For this reason Professor Canna-
way feels that choice of the nick—
name “pioneers" is the best possible.
He thinks it is suitable and different
and contains a more significant
meaning than the commonly used
nickname taken from. an animal pro»
totype.

Faith, Loyalty, Courage.

Hc listed four of the basic char»
ncteristics in the liyes of the pic-
neers: an underlying and conquering
faith in God, 'n themselves. in their
fellowmen: sublime devotion and
deathless loyalty; courage; uncon-
querable spirit, with no thought of
defeat even in the face of disaster.
“These,” he said, ”are the outstand-
ing characteristics of the founders of
Crinnell, qualities which we of today
profoundly need, for the days of pio-
neering have not ceased.”

President John Scholte Noilen ad-
dressed the alumni in a brief welcom~
ing address, in which be included a
statement of the homecoming pro-
gram for the rest of the weekend.
Archibald Cattell, ’91, gave an ilh.
tinted talk on “The Balkans” in the
auditorium of Alumni Recitation hall
at 11 am .
Present Pins.

Honorary Honor G pins were pre-
Sented at the chapel service this
morning instead of between halves
of the Grillnelerx-ake game as
was previously planned. The pins
were presented by John Shep-
hard reprcscntrng the Honor G club.
Those who received the award for in-
tcrcst and support of Grinncll dLhr
lotics wcrc: Prof. Earl D, Strong,
Prof H. W. Norris, Prof. Joscph W.
Charlton and Archibald Cattell. '91.
Since J. N Darling, who also was to

present his honorary pin will be for-
warded to him

Nine Members of Football
Squad Will Report

After the football Season is con?-
pleted this afternoon, nine members
of the varsity grid squad will report
for basketball practice, which is be-
ing held every night at the men's
gymnasium under the direction of
Coach John C. Trllesdale.

The men who will report from the
football squad are Juliu‘s Bauer, Jim
Bradley, Gene Klepfer, Bill McFarlin.
Ed Heuningsen, Bob Morgan, Dick
Phelps, and Captain Gaston Santi.
Those who have been out for prac—
tice already are Dick Mason, Herve
Olipllant, Mickey Frye, Gil Collison,
Les Manns, Paul McCIIlly and Robert
McAlister. of these men, four, Santr,
Manns, Mason, and Frye, are letter-
men.

As far as a preseason estimate is
.oncerned, it seems as if the mater
lRl is of a. higher calibre than it has
been for several seasons, and there
promises to be a great deal of compe.
tition for the various positions. So
far none of the men have been par
ticularly outstanding.

Thc problem for the year, accord
ing to Tlucsdale, is to cut down the
opponents average, to improve on last
years “28 point team", and to de-
velop a scoring centcr who can give

Gl‘innell the possession of the ball,‘

or at least effectively contest with
the opposing center for the ball.
The center position is wide open.
with Morgan, Bauer, Oliphant, and
Phelps being the material for this
berth. The forwards are Co‘lison,
Frye, Klepfcr, McFar-lin, Mason, and
Oliphant, and those out for the guard
posts are Bradley, DuMont, McCully,
Santi, Manns. and Henningsen.

PLAY LAST GAME
Five Pioneers will be playing
their last game for Crinnell this
afternoon. They are: Capt. How—
ard (Peko) Gould, tackle and
guard; Bob (Pete) McKee, end;
Abe Rosenbioom, guard: Albert
(Tarzan) Rose, fullback, and

Sammie Singer, quarterback.

The game today will be the second
encounter of the season for the two
schools. Drake having won the first
game, which was played at Dee
Moincs, 13 to 0. Watt has been send
ing his men through severe scrim—
mages against the freshmen this
week. They showed up exceptionally
well on offensive, especially with
blocking.

The Pioneers seemed at the peak
of their defensive work of the sea-
son in the game against Haskell last
week, and if they maintain this in
addition to their improvement on of-
fensive, they will probably be at their
best for the game.

The same lineup that was used dur-
ing most of the Haskell game will
probably be started against Drake,
with Bernard Trumbull being placed
at center in place of Mccter and with
some controversy regarding the
starting men in the btckficld,
