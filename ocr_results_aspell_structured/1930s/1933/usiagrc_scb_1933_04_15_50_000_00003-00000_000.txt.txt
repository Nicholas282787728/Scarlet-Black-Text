‘Hitler Harmful’
Workers College
Speaker Asserts

“I belicvc that Hitler will do for
more harm than good for Germany
and \l'orld harmony because of his ex-
trcme nationalistic views," stated
Manuel Brown in his thk on “Hitler
mFower and Pclsecution" before the
Workers Cooperativc college at El
meeting in the Congregational church
Monday evening.

“Hitler, 2m Austrian, a Roman
Catholic, and a world Wal‘ hero," hc
continued, “has come legally into the
power of a dictator because of a ma»
iority of votes in the Reiclistng, And
now he wishes to raise Germany to
its prewar level as a great world
power. To do so he believes that Ger-
many must be ”purified" and that
only Nordics should be allowed to
take part in political and economic
affairs.”

Mr. Brown then described the per-
secution of the Jews whom Hitler be-
lieves are a menace to nationalistic
development in Germany and whom
he is attempting to eradicate by
force. The speaker also told of the
street fighting between the commun-
ists and the Nazis. “Hitler believes in
a high tariff to protect German
formers, but through this Germany
is losing an enormous amount of ex
ports each year," remarked Brown.

talking motion picture machine, op-
erated by David hair, the talking
light beam, in charge of Morris
Brown and the photo-electric cell
manned by Joseph Canard. Each
showing of the talking motion pic-
ture was well attended.

of lighting a vacuum tube by mere»
ly waving a hard rubber rod was
demonstrated by William Leachman.
The wonders of electromagnetism,
thermoelectricity and many other
demonstrations, each one important
in itself were also explained.

Unknown to most of the visitors to
the ‘open house" was the fact that
the huge Seth Thomas clock on ex-
hibit in Mr. Gales office has a mate.

So after tobacco has been properly aged,
one of the ﬁrst things to do is to remove

the stems.

But what has this to do with your enjoy-

It means that we start right when we make
Chesterﬁeld—the right kind of leaf with
the stern removed, the right manufacture
—evetything that science knows that can
make CHESTERFIELD a milder cigarette, a
cigarette that tastes better.

That’s Why people say ”They Satisfy."
