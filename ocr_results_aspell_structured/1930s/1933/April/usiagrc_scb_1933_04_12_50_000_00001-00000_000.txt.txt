Bennett Bill
Hits Teachers

Wehrhan Says Tax Slash

to Increase Ovetrslupply

The Bennett—Beatty bill that passed
the legislative body of the State last
Monday will have a great effect up-
on the already oversupply of Leache
ers, according to Nelson w. Wehr-
han, director of vocational guidance.
The appropriations for all schools
that are supported by taxes were
Slashed over 5 million dollars.

“This is and will continue to have
a discouraging effect upon college
students graduating this year and
who are planning to take up teach-
ing as a life profession, since the

chief means of reducing the expenses,

of schools will he the reduction of
teaching staffs”, said Wehrhan.

Mr. Wehrhan declared that the
prospecm for teaching positions 0qu

rank by a considerable extent any-

other profession, regardless of the
unfavorable conditions surrounding
the teaching profession.

Retiring Council
Hopes to Install
Telephone Booths

A plan to establish at least one
telephone booth in each of the men's
dormitories has been formulated by
the retiring council of house presi-
dents, Walter Straley, president of
the council, has announced. Their
work in this matter is to be continued
by the newly elected council.

Funds for the plan may he turns
ishcd either by the college. or other
sources, If the plan goes through,
work will be begun as soon as poss-
ible, in order that the booths may be
completed by the time school starts
in the fall,

Mr. Straley hopes that the council
will be able to enclose every tele-
phone in the dormitories with a booth.
but regards this as very unlikely. He
thinks it probable, however, that one
booth may be established in each of

> the halls.

Alcott’s Dr_ama,
‘Little Women’
Pleases Critics

College Actors to Repeat
Play in Quadrangle
Theallre Tonight

By Lillie Hagen
“Little Women“ was a hit.
two-fold novelty of seeing Louisa M.
Alcott‘s quaint,
come to lifc in the quadrangle little
theatre last night, with an almost
entire change of cast in each of the
four acts, captured and held the in~
terest of a large and varied audience.
When Mrs, Sara Sherman Pryor,
with the assistance of four students,
can direct a college play so convinc-

wruug from hardss‘nelled professors
and sophisticated students alike,
there is no doubt that the depart-
ment of drama can put on "hit" on—
tertainment.

Repeated Tonight

“Little Women" will be repeated
at eight o'clock tonight in the little
theatre. It is directed by Louise
Smith in the first act, Lois Lyon in
the second, Helen Dawson in the
third, and Maurice Blrdsall in the
fourth. Sophus Hanson designed the
stage settings, Robert M Brown is
stage manager and elec ian, while
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor is super-
vising the production.

Outstanding performances were
given last night by Mae-Floyd Sinex,
who practically stole the first act
with her charming characterization
of Amy, Sabeth Mix, who made a
very real Jo, Maurice Birdsall as the
kindly German professor, Mr. Bacr.
Leone Chisholm as the demure and
lovable Meg, and Richard Schaen as
the loyal playmate, Laurie.

Effective Acting

Vivian Huseby as the fragilc Beth
was responsible for much of the
pathos of the third act. Minor roles
were well played by Ruth Sterns and
Frances Mussy as the rasping, ec-
centric Aunt March, Irma Cooper
and Stephanie camp as Hannah, the
maid, Don Ross as Mr. Lawrence, and
Keith Palmer, Richard Kuncl, and

Harry Allen as Meg’s slllto, John

Delegates Vote on Current
Questions at Final

Meeting

By Malcom Thompson

That pacifism has a firinhold on
the Iowa collcglans who were here
to attend the conference on economic
resolutions last weekend, was indi-
cated by the fact that 30 out of 44
delegntes voting declared they would
refuse to fight in any war, regard
less of circumstances

The vote was taken at it meeting,
held Sunday morning, for the purpose
of voting on various pertinent hues
Lions. It was attended by it little less
than half of the 114 dclegatcs pres-
ent at the conference.

“’nllt Thrills Reduced

Ten of the delegates voting on the
question of personal paciflsm said
they would not fight unless the
United States should be lnvatled,
While four, or one-eleventh, of those
voting indicated thell‘ intentions of
fighting in any war in which this
country seemed to them to be on the
side of right.

All delegates at the session were
agreed that a reduction should be
made in tariffs, most of them favor-
ing a definite free trade policy, to be
reached by gradual reductions.

Favor League
They were also unanimous in fa.

voring entrance of the United states.

into the League of Nations, the ma-
jority advocating entrance without
reservations, Most of them voted in
favor of this country immediately
becoming a member of the World
Court,

The vote on the war debt question,

was closer, 19 feeling that war debts
should be cancelled, while 27, or a
bore majority, were in favor of a re
duction of the debts in compensation
for a European concession, Only five
voted for full collection of thc debts.

lem of reapportiohing the semester

Committee Plans
Clubroom Books
for Men’s Halls

“We hope to install the separate
ball libraries in the men's dormitor-
ies sometime this spring,” stated
Miss Isabelle Clark, head librarian
yesterday.

Several books have been ordered
from the regular library fund, accord-
ing to Miss Clark. and the staff is
sorting out some books that the

library will be able to get along Wltllr
out.

It is planned to put about 25 or all
books in each club room to begin
with, although more volumes will
probably be added next fall if the ex-
periment proves to be popular.

The object of the plan this spring
is primarily to find out what types
of books are wanted and to get the
project under way for the next year.
A committee from the council of
house prcsidcnts, working under
Clarence James and with Miss Clark,
has been attending to tho arrange-
ments.

“It is hoped that we may soon
have some similar arrangement for
the wome in the quadrangle," stat-
ed Miss Clark, “but I do not believe
that much will be done about it until
next school year.”

be played Friday afternoon, captain
“Peko” Gould and Abe Rosenbloom,
both veteran linemen. will lead thc
teams which will battlc next Friday.

Men from this year’s unscored upon
freshman team have dominated the
scrimmages to date. Julius Bauer,
Jim Bradley and Don Arnold of the
prep backfield have shown to good
advantage as ball carriers. Tommy
McGuire, Hatfield, Burrows, Trum-
bull and Bob and Bill Evans, are line-
men who are expected to provide stiff
competition for veteran linemen next
fall. ‘

Of the veterans reporting, Vic Finl
and Ed chningsen are showing good
form in the backfield, while Gould is
outstanding on the line Flni and
Bauer have been taking care of the
passing which is essential in Coach
Watt's style of attack. Scotty Mc—
Leod, prep back, and chningscn ap-
pear to be the best puntlng material
on the squad.

With the rest of the week being
takcn up by scrimmagcs, the Pioneer
squad should be in great shape by
Friday and should give a good idea
of what is to be expcctcd from next
years team.

Librarian Reports New
System Satisfactory

The new library system which al-
lows students to keep reserve books
only one hour has been working out
satisfactorily so for, according to
Isabelle Clark, librarian.

Miss Clark says that few fines
have been assessed students for keep-
ing books too long. but that the staff
has been exercising leniency in this
respect. She reports that the new sys-
tem is a great help to many students,
since others are more ready to turn
reserve books in as soon as they are
through with them,
