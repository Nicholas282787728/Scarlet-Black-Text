outs. From these tryouts the finalists

Five Gates Hall Men Gain Places
on 1933 All-Dorm Kittenball Teams

Dibble's southpaw hurler; Bob Adams,
Smith left fielder, who led the hatt-
ing for the entire dorms; and Julius
Bauer, prep slugger for Clark hall,
were unanimous selections for places
on the teams.

All teams seemed to have capable
men behind the bat, with Vic Fini
and Dick Ullrich taking the advant-
age due to their batting abilities. The
playing this season Seemed to be
quite erratic on many occasions, and
some of the players who have been
given places on the teams were weak
in some of the tilts and played bang-
up ball in others, The scores and up-
sets in some battles showed that
many of the clubs had their vicissi-
tudes.

Gates hall led the list, placing five
of their men on the team, with Dibble
and Smith each having four of their
players listed. Clark hall put three
men on the first team and Langan
and Rawson each got two mentions.

Because of the wealth of material
for some of the places several of the
men were placed at positions that
they had not played at during the
season, but because of their superior
ability they could not be left un»
mentioned.

Mayflower
Club Meets

Hart Speaks to Members
Here This Morning

Irwin H. Hart, governor of the
state society of Mayflower Descend»
cnts, was the principal speaker at
the meeting of members and guests
held this morning in the quadrangle
drawing room.

The theme of Governor Hart's
speech was a cartoon by J. N. Dar-
ling which recently appeared in the
Des Moines Register. The figure of
the judge being tortured by farmers
who were trying to prevent a mortl
gage sale was interpreted by Gov-
crnor Hart as the evidence that to-
day every law is challenged and to
withstand that challenge it must have
public opinion behind it.

Hart also said, “Every institution
is being challenged, is it a right
principle?" and in his reply cited the
thing for which the Mayflower Des-
cendonts stand: Obcyance of the
laws as we ourselves have made for
our own conduct.

Reports were received from Mrs.
Rankln, historian, who has worked
“six hours a day for the last Six
weeks" to complete the lineage books
which were distributed to members
today; and from Miss Jessie Kelley,
member of the committee of the na-
tional society.
