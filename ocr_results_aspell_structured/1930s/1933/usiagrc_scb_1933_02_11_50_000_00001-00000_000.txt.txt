muslc Paul Kocnanskl at once staked

his reputation on his ability both as
a musician and a virtuoso. They are.
not the same thing. Virtuosity is the}
player’s control over his instrument
through highly sensitized nervous and
muscular responses. Musicianship is
intelligence, feeling and taste.

So Mr. Kochanski stood up face to
face with Bach, Brahms, and De-
bussy, three of the greatest imagina-
tions our era has known, and through
his musicianship and his virtuosity he!
brought us all to an exalted level of
appreciation and friendship. When
one says this much, he has said about
all of it.

showed his superiority over the other
