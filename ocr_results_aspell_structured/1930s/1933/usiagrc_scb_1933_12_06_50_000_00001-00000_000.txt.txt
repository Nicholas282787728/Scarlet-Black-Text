IDr.’ Tarbell’s
Magic Tricks
Will Entertain

Performer Will Demonstrate
Art in First of Lecture
Series Here, Dec. 14

Dr. Harlan Tarbell, head of the
Tarbell System, Inc., the largest
school of magic in the world, will ap-
pear in the first of the 1933-34 Grins
nell college lecture course series
Thursday, Dec. 14, at s p. m, in Hen
rick chapel,

The magician will demonstrate
such tricks as “The Hindu Rope Mys-
tery,” "Oracles of the Desert," and
"Eyeless Vision,” according to ad
vance publicity, and will lecture on
and demonstrate "Magic of the
Ages: students will be admitted
upon presentation of semester fee
booklets.

Tarbell has students of magic
tricks in every ciw zed country of
the world, according to publicity, and
has counselled with all the leading
magicians of his generation. For two
years he was first vice-president of
the national council of the society of
American Magicians,

l-lis repertoire includes an array of
mysteries, presented in costume, from
the "trick bags" of master magicians
of India, China, Japan, Europe and
America.

That Dr. Tarbell has been well re-
ceived is evidenced by the press no-
tices given him by such newspapers
as the New York Sun, New York
‘World, and Chicago Evening Post.
Houdini, the master magician, is re-
ported to have once said, “Tarbell is
in a class by himself,” while Newton
D. Baker said, "Dr. Tarbeil's seeing
fingers make me doubt the reliability
of my five senses."

Steiner Expresses
Eulogy ofFormer
Grinnell Student

An appreciation of Florence Lcwis,
'32, whose death occurred at Webster
Grove. Mo., last Wednesday mom»
ing, was expressed yesterday by Dr.
Edward A. Steiner, professor of ap»
plied Christianity here

The death of Miss Lewis followed a
day’s illness from diabetes, accord-
ing to word received by her friends
here this week, She had completed
her mid-semester examinations Fri-
day, Nov. 24, at Washington univcr»
sity in St. Louis. where she was
working toward obtaining her mas-
ter's degree in English. Tuesday at
her home in Webster Grove she sud-
denly became ill and at 3 p. m. was
taken to a hospital. She died at 7
a. m. Wednesday.

Dr. Steiner stated yesterday that
Miss Lewis was destined from her
birth to be a Crinnellian. “Her early
life was steeped in the Grinnell spir-
it and her mind was filled by the:
Grinnell tradition. l-ier mother, whose
maiden name was Cynthia Meyer of,
the class of 1902, coveted for hcri
daughter the privilege "of Grinnell‘
college where sbc herself gained a
commanding place in its literary,
cial, and religious activities.

“I was favored by seeing Florence
Ruth in her own home at Webster
crove, Mo, She was one of a bcau-‘
tiful and happy family, and ‘she,
looked forward with eagerness to‘
entcring Grlnnell college, which was
to bc the fulfillment of her ardent,
desircs. ,

“Hers was the kind of life which:
feeds thc never falling fountain froml
which the Crinncll spirit flow. Hov—
ing been her teachcr and hcr friend
I feel myself bereft; hut inasmuch
as She always carried a bit of Heav-
cn with her, hcr lo is above carthly
grief and l‘evcrhemt ~ with joy."

Grinnell Chosen
’34 State Track
Site by Coaches

Ward field was dcfinitcly sclectod
as the sitc for the 1934 statc track
and field meet at a mccting of state
college track coaches at Iowa City
Saturday.

Grlnuell was last host to the track
athletes of the state in 1925. After
that meet, which was won by the
University of Iowa, the affair was
abandoned until four years ago.

Since the renewal of the state
meet, according to Lester Duke,
track coach, only the larger institu.
tions in the state have been entering
teams, It is his hope that the entries
this year may be increased to include
many of the smaller colleges which

formerly competed in the annual
meet.

Pioneer, Tutor

Fives to Clash

Center Post Still in Doubt;
Morgan Ineligible

Coach John C. Truesda‘le's dilemma
as to who should start at center in
the Pioneer's opening cage encounter
with Iowa State Teachers Saturday
has been somewhat simplified with
the announcement that Morgan will
not be available for the game. A con-
dition in Spanish is the cause of
Morgan's temporary ineligibility. ,

At least eight men will see service
against the Tutors, Truesdals an-
nounced yesterday, mentioning Ma—
son, Erye and Oliphant, forwards;
Phelps and Bauer, ccntcrs, and Cap-
tain santi, Manns, and DuMon‘t,
guards. Any other men showing up
well during the Week’s practice will
likely be used also, the coach added.

Still bothered by the problem of
filling the center position, Coach
Truesdalc may abandon the style of
offense employed last year which de-
pends upon the pivot man situated
on the foul line as the background
for the scoring plays. However no
change will be taken unless the show-
ing in the Teachers game prompts
such a step, he stated.

Des Tells

College Group to Live
on Basis of Faith

Moines Pastor

“The only way to find out if there
is a God is to live as if there were a
God," dcclarod the Rev. Stoddard
Lone, pastor of the Plymouth Cons
gregational church, Des Moines, and
n Crinnell college trustee, in an ad»
dress on "Religion for the College
Student" in the quadrangle little tho-
atre Tuesday evening. Approximately
150 students were present.

“Sceptics object to religion be
cause it is built on faith, and not on
reason and knowledge," the Rev. Mr.
Lane said, “but all of life is based
upon faith in assumptions that can-
not be proved. The whole structure
of science rests back on assumptions
that have never been wholly demon—
strated and probably never will be."

Science Not Exact

“Faith is acting on the hypothesis
that there is a God, using it as the
guiding principle in the experiment
of living," he declared, quoting Prof.
Edgar S. Brightman. “Science as-
sumes that our senses give us a cor
rect report of the outside world, but
how do we know? We must take
this hypothesis by faith, so religion
is not the only sphere where faith is
necessary.”

Admitting that reli ion is based
upon assumptions that have never
been wholly demonstrated, the Rev.
Mr. Lane nevertheless declared that
“These assumptions were not spun
out of thin air, but were the result
of observation and experience. They
may not be absolutely true, but we
are reasonably certain of them be-
cause they workithey get results."

Belief Applicable

The importance of not only having
a religion, but of using it was also
emphasized by the speaker, who said
that belief in, or the mere acceptance

Hypothesis in Religion, No Different

ience, Declares Lane

of religion is useless unless the be-
liever has faith enough to use it as
n working principle of life.

“Religion must be tried out before
one can judgc if it is successful," the
Rev. Mr. Lone concluded. “To try to
prove life worthwhile, live a worth
while life."

Invited by Forensic

Mr, Lane was brought to Gn'nnell
by the Men's Forcnsw club. He was
introduced by Edson Attleson, presi-
dent of the organization, and his ad»
dress followed a joint dinner of the
Men's and Women's Forensic groups
in the quadrangle dining room.

Guests of honor at the dinner, in
addition to the Rev. Mr. and Mrs.
Lane, were Dr. and Mrs. Edward A.
Steiner, Mrs. John S. Nollen, Mrs.
John P. Ryan. Miss Flomnce Stoakes,
Dean Evelyn Gardner, and Dean Shel—

Flavin’s ‘Children of Moon'
on Friday Schedule

"Children of the Moon,” to he give
on Friday at 21:15 p. m. as the Sec»
ond presentation of the drama dc-
partment, was first produced on the
New York stage in 1924 and is one
of the plays of the American play»
wright. Martin Elavin.

Other plays of his produced in
New York during reccnt years in-
clude “Calib Stone's Death Watch."
1925, "Lady of the Rose,” 1925, “Sen
vice for Two,” 1927, and "The Crim-
inal Code,” 1930.

The action is laid during the post
war period and deals with the Cyni—
cism or futility of life. It has a
strain of mysticism throughout.

One scene, a picturesque room in an
old English manor on the seacoast
of the British isles, is used for the
three acts of the play, Surprising and
beautiful effects are scoured by the
special lighting which has been ar-
ranged.

James Coddington, who takes the
part of a young aviator, and Ruth
Pilgrim, the daughter of the weird
English family, provide the romantic
love story around which the plot is

cph Conard, president of the Young

dents show sufficient interest.
