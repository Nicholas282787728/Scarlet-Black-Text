Adverfised

Journals Judged

In Yokohama, Japan, a college
newspaper must undergo a fourfold
censorship,

Before going to press all subject
matter and advertisements must
pass the college censors, and after
being’printed the paper must be
sent to the state department of Ja-
pan, the metropolitan police depart-
ment at Tokio,,and to thc local po—
lice.

Home in Yokohama

Eiiji Nan'fl (pronounced Nahndii,
now completing his senior year in
Grinnell, was editorinrchief of The
Yokohama KosherGakuho, which iS
the student paper of the Yokohama
college. Hc served in that position
for two years, before coming to thc
United States to complete his edur
cation. His home is in Yokohama.

From Nani-i it is learned that a
college newspaper in Japan is differ-
ent in many respects from one in
this country. Perhaps the first thing
one would notice, if he could tell
which was front and which the back
of the paper, would be that the front
page is very different from anything
Americans are used to.

Books Advcrtiscu

It is cntirely, or almost entirely.
filled with advertising, and stranger
still, most of the advertiscmcnts pro.
mote the sale of books. Fully 90 per
cent of tho advertising in a Japanese
college paper is that of the book
stores. In fact the quality of the
newspaper, and cvcn of the collcgc,
is usually judged by the number of

The remainder of thc advertising
usually consists of advertisements
from tea shops and eating places
near the campus. They are not gill»
en as much space in the paper for
the same amount of money as the
book stores, for the Japanese Stu~
dents only print such tea room ad»
vertisements because they need the
money to finance the paper. They
would prefer to have only book ad-
vertisenients.

Everything Reversed

Nanii explains that a college pa-
per in Japan is not Selfrsuppirting,
and the college usually has to grant
a sum of money to complete the pay
ment of expenses. The students who
work on the paper receive only we
pense money when it is necessary
for them to travel for the paper. All
students in the college are requircrl
to Subscribe to thc paper, and they
all read it thoroughly, even taking
it to classes with them.

The front page of a Japanese pa—
per is in the position occupied on De»
cidental papers by back page, and
the columns run across instead of
down the page. There are not many
editorials, but usually a long column
of edited Student opinion on some

Dcspite a Steady di zle last night,
Watt sent his men through a series
of pass, kic 'ng, and blocking funda-
montals, finishing off with a hard
scri image. All of the veterans and
other men who saw the most action
in the Geo game last Friday evening

edge over the Michigan clevcn, in
that their opponents will be playing

McNun Imus-ed

Reports from Michigan State re-
veal that Captain McNutt, fullback,

flm,: was. witnessed the coecrin-
nell game here last week, and in an
interview, stated that his bail car-
riers were lighter than usual, and,
with the exception of McNutt, in-

the average of the line was nearly
190 pounds, despite losing six letter
men by graduation last year.

Fall Track Meet Replaces
Varsity Harrier Team;

Halls to Compete

Plans are now being formulated for
a fall inter-dorm track meet to be
held the latter part of October,
which will be expected to take the
place of cross-country, dropped from
tho Grinnell intercollegiate sport
calendar.

Last year the varsity Pioneer har-
riers werc undefeated.

Coach Lester" Duke, track coach
and intramural director, announced
today that he planned to present a
trophy to the winning team, which
must be won three years in succession
to become a permanent possession of
the hall. The cup will he called the
“Mike Pilbrow trophy” in recognition
of the excellent record established
by the Pioneer track captain last
year.

No distance runs will be held in
this meet, but instead, it is planned
to have a crosscountry meet as one
of the events, awarding several more
points for a first place to the win-
ning team. This, it is hoped, will
help to take the place of cross-coun-
try. All other events will be held in
the same manner as the regular
spring track meet. This addition to
the intramural program will not‘
count in the final race for the Pottle
trophy.

With the exception of varsity foot-
ball men, all others in school will
be eligible for the meet, varsity
track men will be placed in charge
of the various halls.
