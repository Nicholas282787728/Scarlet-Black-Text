a CHANCE FOR STUDENT ACTION

Crinnell students have asked this question many times for the
last several yearsi‘ﬂow are we expected to maintain Grinnell spirit
in the face of athletic teams which continually lose?"

True, to maintain an enthusiastic school spirit our teams must
win games, not continually lose them.

This brings up a riddle similar to that old Oneivvhich came
first, the hen or the egg? Does school Sp 't and enthusiasm hiing
about winning teams? Or do winning teams bring about school
spirit and enthusiasm?

Let us go on the assumption that spirit and enthusiasm is a
great factor in bringing about winning athletic teams. What are
some of the things which the student body can do to create and‘

maintain the real Ci-innell Spirit? .
One of the first requisites in a live and up-andecomlng school is

a good college band.

The Crinnell college band has an excellent director who is trying
hard to build tip a good organization. But what kind of support
does he receive from the student body? With an enrollment of
approximately 790 students, Grihnell maintains a 30-piece band.

A check at the office of the dean of men of those persons who
play band instruments reveals that at least 75 Grinnell men play
such instruments. It is highly possible that an equal number of
Criniiell women do likewise. Among the 75 men who play instru—
ments, there are 13 trombone players. How many of these are in
the band doing their share in building up Grinnell spil‘itl—Only
THREE! Of these 75 men who play band instruments, 24 ley the
clarinet. How many of these are in the band doing their share in
building up Crinnell spirit? only SK!

Grinnell could and should he maintaining anexcellent 75-piece
band of the following compos on: clarinets, 24; cornets, 16; trom-
hones, 12; bass, 3; bassoon, 2; and drums, 5

It’s up to you, Grinnell students. Here is one way for you to
help build up Crinnell spirit and enthusiasm—one way you can help
our teams to will. will you cooperate? Or will you continue to
laugh at Gi'innell’s band and continue to “gripe” about Grinnell's
losing athletic teams? .

THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE SCARLET AND BLACK.

JG]
WHAT IS COMMUNISM?

Editor's note: With Europe torn between two flaming camps;

with Germany and Italy bearing the banner of Fascism and Russia

representing communism, it would be well for us to know exactly
what Fascism is; what Communism is; and what Socialism is

What do they all stand for? _ _
A. short time ago the christian Science Monitor presented a

short article, “Communism vs. Fascism—A Simplified. study" which
discussed these two types of economic-political organization as well

as socialism.
Using that article as a basis for editorial comment, the Scarlet

and Black will present three editorials within the next} several weeks
discussing in succession Fascism, Communism and Socialism.)

When communism is mentioned in the United States, Russian
communism is generally thought of. That is the type of communism
which we intend to discuss.

Government ownership of capital and land and government
direction of labor is the theory of Russian communism.

In theory, too, the communism of Russia is the absolute rule by
die workers. This is regarded as the dictatorship of the proletariat
by the Russian communists. Actually, however, there are nearly
200 million persons living under Russian rule, and only three million
of them are members of the government party, Regardless of party
membership, however, the real ruling power is in the hands of
Joseph Stalin. Actually, we see that the dictatorship is over the
proletariat rather than by them.

What does the Russian dictatorship (10? Of what value is )L'.’
It maintains order among the people until they are all converted to
communism. It defends and secures the state from Countererevolu-
tion, It preserves and develops the natural resources of the country.
It stamps out all opposition. It builds up a mighty military organi—
zation. lt firmly establishes communism and sees that it is working
properly before it turns the reins of government over to the people.

Religion has no place in the Russian communistic organization.
The leaders of the country do all in their power to keep people away
from the churches.

Theoretically, communism is international. Practically it is not.
It is because of this fact that Leon Trotzsky, the exiled Russian com-
munist, has spoken so strongly. However, some students of com-
munism believe that once Stalin has achieved a strong Russian state,
he will attempt to spread the red gospel throughout the world.

Communism, we have seen, is a dictatorship of the proletariat.
theoretically, but actually a dictatorship by one man. It is theore—
tically international but actually national—at least for the present.
It is opposed to the church, as we have seen. and is antagonistic to
the upper and middle classes. #J.D.N.

Faculty Dog Show

Sponsored by Scarlet and Black

Professors’ Pets Range
from Aristocrats
to Curs

“A faculty dog show should no
sponsored by the Scarlet and
Black,” stated Frederick L Baur
mann, associate professor of his
tory, when inter-viewed the other
day about his famous stream-
lined dachshund, thc Countess Mar
thilde von Zeppelin.

”The other owners are uncuthu-
siastic about it because they know

no other clog on the faculty could-

possibly compete with zeppy. She’s
unique among dachshunds because
she has silky hair."

This statement was the result
of the great spirit of rivalry and
pride among the Crinnell faculty
as to the merits of their respective
canine pets, who range from
thoroughbreds to mongrels.

Stoops‘ Dogs Delicate

Fetchita and Betty, Pomeranians
owned by J. D. Stoops, professor
of philosophy. are well known to
the campus. The little, silky-haired
dogs bark at everyone, indiscrimi—
nately, and are so delicate that
they must be treated carefully.
They take their meals from the
floor by the table as their master
eats.

The dog which belongs
Lookabaugh, head football coach,
is only a mongrel. but she is a
treasured gift. For sentimental
reasons, her name has never been
changed from the original, Sweet
Pea. Mrs. Lookabaug‘h’s mother
named her that because she re—
minded her of her favorite flower.

Chapel Date

Peter and Patsy, wire-haired
terriers, have a chapel date every
morning. Peter is the pet of Eds
ward B. T. Spencer, professor of
Greek, and Patsy belongs to Mrs,
George A. Clark, associate in pub
lic relations. They are both about
five years old, came from Osha-
loosa, and grew up together,

“Patsy loves to sit in high spots
and gaze through the Window,"
Mrs. Clark said, “and if she misses
a member of the family, She’s
likely to call at all the proper
places until She ﬁnds her."

Also only a mongrel, but deservs
ing of mention because he is ev-
erybody’s friend, is Dicky, the
playful pet of Mr. Earl D. strong,
professor of economics.
