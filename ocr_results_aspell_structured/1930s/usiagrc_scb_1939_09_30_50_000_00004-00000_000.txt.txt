During the second quarter, play
shuttled back and forth between
the 25 yard lines. In the closing
minutes of the first half, carie-
ton started a drive that was me»
rientarily stopped by the Pioneers,
but was immediately picked up
again when the Car-ls recovered
Iamann's fumble on Grinnell's 23
yard line. The drive was stopped
by the ending of the first half
with the ball resting just 15
yards short of the Grinnell goal
Pioneers Fall Short.

The scarlet and black clad
warriors missed scoring by inches
in the third quarter when Don
Niftenegger, reserve end, recover-
ed a bad pass by the Carleton
:eiitei- just thiee yards from the
goqune. Hamann and "Odebolt"
tried desperately to reach pa
tlii-t hut succeeded in getting on ,
two yards of the necessary thae.
Halter at Carleton kicked out of
danger to the Gi-innoll 45 and
the only Pioneer threat of the
evening was stopped cold.

In the mad fourth period when
the Chris scored both their touch-
downs, nothing seciuod to stop

for both markers. At the onset
of the quarter, Carleton started
from its own 25 yard line and
through a series of plays, includr
ing a forward-lateral pass play
that netted 25 yards, placed the
pigskin in scoring position on
the 18 yard marker. From here
Roiter smoothly slipped through
the Grinnell eleven for the initial
score of the game.

ltaltar Repeats

A few minutes later, Raiter
again crossed into the pay strip
from almost the same position as
the ﬁrst touchdown. To add in4
suit to injury, Raiter also kicked
the point after touchdown to
make the score read: Dick Raiter
14, Grinnell 0,

Without a doubt the outstand-
ing individual star of the eve-
ning was Raiter, In the Ca 194
ton line, Co-Captain “Bud” Kieling
seemed to be in on more than his
share of the plays.
