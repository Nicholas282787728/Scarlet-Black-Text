_Campus Rulers

Take Command
at Cyclone Bull

Amidst the festivities of the sec-
ond annual Cyclone ball in the men's
gymnasium Saturday evening, Grin-
nell Students witnessed the coronation
of Dorothy Thompson, president of
the Women's Self Government lean
gue, and lack Maxfield, president of
the Council of House Presidents, as
King and Queen of the 1935 Cyclone
ball, and the most representative
students in the campus.

Seated on_a throne which was ex-
posed to view at 11 pm. by the open»
ing‘ of the covers of a, giant model of
the 1935 Cyclone, Miss Thompson and
Maxfleld presided at the dance.

Through the courtesy of Talbott's
and the College Shop, roses were
presented to each woman from a dis
play booth decorated in silver and
blue. A dozen roses were also pre-
sented to the Cyclone Queen by Tril-
ott's following the ceremony.

Music for the dance was furnished
by Tony Luff and his 10 piece or-
chestra of Minneapolis whose late or-
rival as the result of auto trouble
necessitated a postponement of the
affair until 10:30 o'clock and an ex-
tension of hours to 12:30 o'clock.

The sovereigns were selected by a‘
student poll last week.

Adeline Light, senior, and Betty
Compton, junior, were second and
third respectively in the contest for
Queen, while second and third places
for the King went to Dwight Camp-
bell and William Bennett, both sen—
iors.

“indiana university students will
again have the opportunity to get
ten cent rncals at the cooperative
dining hall run by the school. Meals
are to be served every week day,
and tickets for the week cost $1.80.
The idea was tried out for the first
time last year and was continued
throughout the summer session. 250
students have already signed up to
join the “dimerdining crew." The
university finance committee must
pass on their names before they are
permitted to join the organization.

The songs were Homcr's "Sing Me a

panied at the piano by Richard Kuncl.

Fl‘of. Raymond B. McClenon esti»
mated in a short address that 90 per
cent of the present day students do
believe in democracy, after his timely
inquiry, “Do you believe in democ-
lacy?"

"The complacency and self-satis-
faction of our leaders in the cause of
democracy has made for a dissatis-
faction which was inevitable," he
said. “Two things disturb our com-
placency, namely: the many voices
which question the wisdom, justice
and value of democracy; and the
many steps taken by the government
away from the principles of democ—
racy.”

In conclusion a personal appeal
was made for all college groups to
study conditions, and to evaluate
them to see whether the present
economic strife is to be temporary
or permanent.

‘Control Physical
Science Products
by Social Science’

"We must create a social science to
control the products of physical 501'
ence and thereby ninkc ours a richer
civilization," stressed Prof. J. D.
Stoops as he presented his problem at
vcsper services Sunday afternoon.

"And yet,“ he continued, “unless
we can see the mind as somehow be-
longing to nature rind to an organ»
ized human society there is no hope
for a social science.“

In tracing philosophic beliefs, Pror
fessor Stoops observed that Pythas
gores, representing the ancient
Greeks, had stated, “We know noth-

i
l
J

mg of the renl_world." “And now,‘
he continued, “modern science has
mcrcly reconstructed that of the
Greeks. The world is still in the
some predicament and no one knows
how to bring the picces together.

“Individualism prevents us- from
realizing that thi. ’s a durable world,"
Mr. Stoops declared. "Our individual-
istic gardens are blown to pieces in
case of war; and there will be war
unless a social science is developed."

Following the dinner the women

for quadrangle women which was
held in 1918 duing the influenza epi-

ary measure the college was under

costume,quarantine No chapel exercises were

held, and although walks were per
mitted, students were not allowed to
leave the campus.

The men of the college were under
military restrictions and the quadites
found life dull. To brighten drooping
spirits, the first costume dinner was
planned and held. Since this time,
with few‘exceptions, the Halloween
dinner has been held yearly.
