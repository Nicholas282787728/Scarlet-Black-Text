ON DORMITORY GOVERNMENT _

(Editorial chairman’s note: This is tire fourth of a series of cdr
toriais dealing with various phases of student government. They are
written to inform the student body of the various duties and qualifi-
cations of the officers whom tiie students will be called upon to
elect within the next two months. other editorials dealing with the
topic of student government w 1 appear from time to time.)

Last week the Scarlet and Black published an edlto al
entitled “For Better Student Government," In that editoie
ial one of our college officials was quoted as saying that

Grilmell students can have all of the self—government thatI

they are qualified to handle effectively, and the editorial
board sai . “We are wondellng if the administration hasn’t
allowed some of our student governing organlzations much
m '6 freedom than they deserve and much more rcspoiiSl—
bility than they are capable of bearing." In some ll tanccs
student governmental organizations apparently have been
given more authority than they are capable of handling.
That is obviously true in the case of the men’s government.

It is to be admitted that one branch of our student‘

government has been highly successful under the direction
of its efficient student leaders. The Women’s Self-Govern
ment league, governing body of the quadrangle, has proved
in past years, and especially this year under the direction of
its capable chairman that student govelnment is not a lake
and that it can be successful.

As to the men’s government, little can be said. The
Council of House Presidents in the past has acted more like
a men‘s luncheon club meeting every week and accomplish-
ing little. True, the council adopted a social budget plan
this year and we congratulate them on that move, It is one
of the few constructive things that the dormitory govern-
ment has done in recent years. But, a system of govern
ment which cannot maintain orderly conditions which are
conducive .to study is surely not successful, A system which
allows a perpetual uproar in the dormitories during what are
known as ”quiet hours” should not be tolerated.

Why then hasn't the men’s governmental organization
been successful? Simply because of the attitude taken by
most of the dormitory leaders which can best be plesellted,
by giving the views of the chairman of the Council of House
Presidents. In an address to the lncn of Gl-innell last year,
this officer said among other things that everyone is per-
fectly satisfied with the Grinnell system of student governs;
ment. Continuing, he stated that all the new council need
do is to continue the efforts and policies of the outgoing
officers. Such an attitude is plainly not progressive.

Nearly' 10 years ago, the men’s government of Grinnell
was abandoned when the Court a part of the governing
system, failed to function ill a crisis. A new and TEMPOR-
ARY system was set up by Robert Burlingalnc ’28, at that
time president of Gates hall and Pt. Blayne McCuri'y ’23,
then managing editor of the Scarlet and Black. Mr. Burs
lingame wrote in a letter to the editorial boar . “Let me
emphasize: our primary aim (in setting up the tcmporr '
government) was to avoid a permanent system of men’s
government. We anticipated the day when Gl-inncll life
would have so far crystallized and colici'cd as to permit
others to take up where we left off."

It is obvious that conditions ill the dormitories have
change The paddle is no longer wielded to maintain order
and. discipline. The social life of the dormitories has Chang:
ed, The most harmful change of all, however, lies in the
fact that dormitory leaders no longer care about prog es: in
student government. They are satisfied with the present
conditions which are far from good. It is obvious that the
men’s leaders for sevcral years have not cared “to take up
where we left off" as Mr. Burlingalne wrote. And that is be-
cause of the attitude as c. )r ssed by the men‘s chairmen
that everyone is satisfied in ll the Gl‘ll‘mcli system of stu—
dent government.

Men’s self-government at Grinncll will never progr ss
if the students are to be satisfied with the present govern-

mental seteup which is fargmuch too farifrom perfect.

and the authorities never caught
on that there was a man in the

It all began in a typical newcpa

Find Costume

Discreet inquiries at the quad
Saturday morning revealed no ex-
ti-a costumes, but that afternoon
two were unearthed That evening
we ate downtown, dasliiilg‘ out iii-
to the blizzard to buy such things
as black hair-ribbons and ladies-
cotton stockings,

We made ourselves up with up
stick and rouge borrowed from
friends at the quadrangle. 1 had
.lovely Cupid's bow lips niitl peri-
cilcd eyebrows, but my partner
failed to cover a blue-black heard,
no matter how many layers of
powder he applied, 1 even had
ruby nail-polish Imagine my dis-
gust later to find that ho cold-
ci‘ealn ni- polish-remover had been,
supplied for taking off my dis-
guise.

Holding our high collars around
our faces, wc sauiitered past tlicl

after the Virginia Reel Stumbling
down the steps instead of tripping;
lightly as the weeds do (says
you). we managed to get down
stairs, where we left our coats,
land where I parted with two of
the hoops on my hoolrsltiit

1 had a charming- costumei
some kind of thin, scratchy stuff,
hooped out over a pettiooat that
l couldn’t remember to manage
properly, and a black lace shawl
that was supposed to cover my
arms. I wore a white wig, flow~
crs at rriy neck, and even a wom—
an's wriscwstch. Thei-c didrrt
seem to be anything to do about
my shoes, so 1 just tried to keep

My partner wore a regulatiohl
colonial gentlcrnnrrs costume of
black cotton stockings, knee
bi-eeclies, cutaway coat, and silk
and lace at throat and wrists. He ‘
had a powdered wig, too, and
buckles on his shoes, but that
heard showed up like a drunk at
a w. c, T, U. convention

The minute we started up the
stairs, the girls began to point at
him and giggle: so he volunteered
to stay on the landing, pretending
a nose—bleed or- a good old-fash—
ioned case of hysterics, whilc 1
glided around the floor with a gene

the secret.

We got by all right, too, even
whcii we waltzcd past the alcove
where the chaperoncs watched
the dancing, but when I saw them,

one of the loading scorers of the
league, to one basket for the eve—
filing. At the same time, the red-
headed center managed to snare
most of the rebounds from the
Pioneer basket, and helped to ini-
tiate many Pioneer scoring drives.

Luick was ably seconded by
"Spider“ conwill, forward, who

played a brilliant floor game, fed

the boil to Luick time and time
again for baskets, and made 11
points for himself, mainly on well—
executed individual plays. His
passing and ball handling were
exceptionally good. No less air
fectivc than these two were Bei-
i-y, who held Trish scoreless
throughout the game: Dean, who
covered Shaw, conference leading
scorer, and held him to three
buckets while scoring 11 points
for the Pioneer cause, and Hay-
ward, whose passing and ball
hawking contributed largely to
the Gr-innell victory.

A startling feature oi the game
w s the use by Grinncll of an
enti ely new offensive system, in»
cluding a. set of simple tiproff
plays which caught the Jays come
plotely unprepared, and the use
of fairly long passes to the core
ners to upset the loose Creighton
defense. At the same time, an
important contributing- factor in
the victory was the fire displayu
cd by the Grinnell five. Their
hardedriving' tactics completely
outplayed the Bluejays during
most of the second half,

For Creighton, Shaw, a fast,
shifty forward, was the greatest
offensive threat, although he was
held to three field goals and two
free throws by co-captain Hal
Dean. \IcIvel' had some success
in driving into the basket, but
scored only five points, Busch
