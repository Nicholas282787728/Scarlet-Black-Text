EXCHANGE DINNERS

An objection to the existence of Macy and
Carney is the fact that, to a certain extent,
they isolate their members from the men at
the dormitories. This isolation approaches
the excluslveness of fraternity houses,

Grinnell'College, however, is justly proud
of its dormitory system and the accompany-
ing absence of cliques. It has a reputation
for social equality that is known in many
parts of the world. Both the students and
the faculty are aware that this tradition of
social intermingling is good. It is desirable,
therefore, that an attempt be made to main-
tain this distinction.

It should be pointed out, however, that the
freshmen who live in these houses should
not be censured for exclusiveness. Their
partial isolation and tendency to associate
with members of their own houses is a

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

natural result of centering their busy lives
in off»the—campus halls. For some of them,
there is no effective motivation to go to the
dormitories, not even to the halls with
which they are affiliated.

This motivation has been provided by ex—
change dinners between the dining rooms of
these houses and of the dormitory. After
such dinners, the halls could profitably hold
informal gatherings with their affiliates.

The chairmen, William Pedcrsen of Macy
and Charles Bear of Carney, as well as the
hall officers, should be especially interested
in promoting this plan for larger soclallex»
perience. Close cooperation will be required
of course, in adjusting the numbers of dili-
ers for the cooks of the town houses. Nev-
ertheless, it will be well worth while to
work out the mechanical details of the plan
for the benefits to be acquired.

GET READY FMEWAR!

Recently on this page it was pointed out
that with the coming of election time
“politics makes strange bedfellows” ln that
(1) conservative and liberal Democrats, who
hate each other like poison had temporar-
ily buried the hatchet, and (2) that Repub-
licans had somehow or other been able to
embrace costly pension plans with demands
for balanced budgets and “sound money."

Beneath all tho saber attling of this
campaign, however, there is, at long last, a
change taking place in the Republican party,
All too frequently during the last few
years Republicans have been so obsessed
over Roosevelt that they have preposterous-
ly insulted the average man’s intelligence
in a futile effort to convince the country
that the President is either a dictator or a
communist. The party has becn’controlled
by dead heads who stopped thinklng during
the administration of McKinley. - — - But
today we see a Dewey in New York, all
Aiken in Vermont, a Taft in Ohio, a Win-
ant in New Hampshire, and, wonder of
wonders, a Snltonstall and a Cabot in
Massachusetts who know that the world
has changediond the United States along
with itA—alid who are going down the line
on liberal, socially minded, well-balanced
political platforms William Allan White,
that grand old man of the people from En’y
pol-in, can take heart and realize that his
party has “come to.”

It may be asked what these younger Re-
publicans, whose platforms are so liberal
and socially minded that they read almost
like New Deal speeches, can use for am-
munition to unseat the Democrats? The
answer is that they are not attacking the
social legislation of recent years, but they
are attacking the dirty and crooked Demo-
crat machines of Boston, New York, Chi—
cogo, Kansas City, Jersey City, and the
state machines of Ohio, Missouri and most
of the South, whose stench reaches to high
heaven. It may be in one of these younger
men that the Republicans will find a Loche
invar collie riding out of the current de-
bacle to victory in 1940!

Princeton Agency Formed
To Test Student Opinion

Princeton, N. J. 7 (no?) —
Princeton umversity has estab-
lished a new agency to promote a
closer relationship between stun
dents and faculty on matters of
study and academic standings.

The group, composed of under—
graduate representatives from
each academic department and
from various campus organiza:
tions, will report to faculty come
mittees on matters about which
students can take no direct action,
will test student opinion on the
faculty proposals and will assume
tnsks over which students have
Jurisdiction but for which no com-
mittees are responsible.

The committee will act as a
clearinghouse between the under-
graduates and administration on
general problems of education and
will publish data to tool in the
selection of departments of upper—
class study and m the integration
of courses of study.
