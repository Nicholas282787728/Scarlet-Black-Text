A superstate which will have coercive power
economically and socially, backed by military
force, is the only possible way to obtain inter-
national peace in the opinion of Dr. Grayson
L. Kirk, speaker at the International Relations

conference last week.

He also asserted that none of the European
nations are interested in disarming and admitted
that he saw no reason why they should be in
sight of the fact that nothing is in prospect to
replace arms in assuring national security.

Summed up, his opinion was’ that only
through creation of a sovereign, international
organization can the hope of world peace be
realized.

Proposals of “an international police force”
as the answer to the problem are frequently made
by this and the other would—be world saviour,

with the deepest conviction that such a thing is
humanly possible. Even the Des Moines Regis-
ter, which all native and adopted sons of Iowa
are wont to swear by, declared editorially in
last Sunday‘s issue, “In spite of the nonsense
preached by the Arthur Brisbancs of the world,
we are ultimately going to have to come to some
sort of world policc force whose prestige will in—
sure the lining up on the justice side not only
of thc great powers but the majority of nations."

So far so good, but when the writer of the
editorial seeks to rationalize his statement he as
serts, “It is no more visionary to insist upon that
than it was to insist that a majority of our states,
in the days when they were attempting to form
a union, should dictate the course of the whole
group.”

It would seem that the aforementioned writer
is not closely acquainted Wlth the history of his
country, or he would not base his proposal for
attainment of world peace upon such an incorrect
hypothesis. In the first placc, the reason the
early confederation of the original thirteen colon»
ies, which preceded their consolidation into a
federated union, failed so miserably was that they
refused to give up their sovereignty.

Only after they subordinated their power as
individual states to the power of the central gov-
ernment did their union meet with success. And
as for “the majority dictating the course of the
whole group,” thcsc articles of confederation car-
ried the provision that they would not go into efr
fcct until all the states ratified them—and since
Maryland withheld her approval for three years
the articles, introduced in 1777, did not go into
effect until 1781. Nor, under the succeeding
constitution, were any of the states forced to ally
themselves with the new union.

The Register concludes its proposal, saying,
“In fact, the machinery (the League of Nations
and the World Court) is there and ready to move.
What it requires is merely the resources of
strength that are available and dormant. Nor
could any nation better fill that lack, and with
greater long-run advantage to itself, than the
United States."

Which makes manifest the difficulty which
lies behind the organization of any kind of an
international police force—even in this perfectly
sincere proposal of a very much respected news-
paper, a nationalistic motive lies back of the sug-
gestion.

It is only too true that assurance of perman-
ent world peace must depend upon some sort of
sovereign international administrative body. But
while national sovereignty is so jealously defend-
ed, while nationalism dictates the international
policies of the great powers of the world, the
prospect of any world-wide administrative or—
ganization being formed is, as Dr, Kirk pointed
out, utterly remote—and while this is true, per-
manent world peace must remain a myth,

The Book Nook I

By TED KLEIN

Several new books have recently
been placcdaon the rental shell. A
moment spent in glancing at their
titles may reveal that one of the
latest books you have been wanting
to read is among their number. We
present a short review of a book
which has aroused a good deal of
comment.

WE ACCEPT WITH PLEASURE by
Bcnlal'd dc Veto.

This is a long novel filled with a
variety of things, The story covers
16 months in the lives of a group of
friends who all went to Harvard to»
gether. What occurs in the is months
is conditioned by Julian, one more
friend of- this group, who died shortly
after the Armistice. To Jonathan and
Loring, who are cousins, and Ted, the
frustrated professor, Julian’s spirit
seems to exist as a symbol of what
all of them had hoped to become in
their Harvard days—brave, confident
and strong. In his death Julian has
crystallized this desired perfection
which seems necessary to the fulfills
ment of their own lives.

The author seems to support the
contention that much that was fine in
the social system has gone to seed
since the war and that Boston, with
its decadence, conservatism, and tra-
ditions, most strikingly illustrates the
habitat which hastens that decline.
Certain it is that these characters he
creates, who passionately fling them.
selves into mechanical “escapes" from
unsatisfactory lives, are not typically
Bostonian in their temperament,

The writing is virlle and earnest.
The indelicate is neither avoided nor
overemphasized. The material of the
book is rich because the psychosis
arising out of the desire for ful.
fillment is not limited to that generar
non whose lives were transformed by
the war, but college people today find—
ing themselves balked on ovary hand
will feel a deep sympathy with the
positions of the characters of this
book.

Chisholm.

The very genuine enjoyment which
the ministers who attended the Mid.
West Regional Conference took in the
presentation of “Cox and Box" of—
fered at that time is attested by a
letter received by Sara Sherman Pry-
or, head of the college department of
drama, from the Rev. Howell D.
Davies, regional secretary, which
reads in part:

”Please accept the hearty thanks
of the Mid.West Regional Committee
and the Program Committee and the
whole group of delegates for the most
entertaining operetta. We note that
the department of drama presented
this performance as ‘complimentary
to the Mid—West Regional confer.
ence of Congregational churches'.
We appreciate it very much_

“I must say that 1 cannot recall en—
joying anything more than “Cox and
Box" and it seemed to me that the
quality of the performance is not ex-
ceeded anywhere on any stage in New
York or Chicago I am not yet
through laughing at the rich humor
of that operetta".
