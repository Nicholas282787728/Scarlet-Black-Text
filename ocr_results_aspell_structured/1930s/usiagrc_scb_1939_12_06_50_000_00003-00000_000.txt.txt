George Owen sokol, the Collins

Shows Interpretative

By Robert Hlltcllison.

Over 200 persons turned out last
night to attend the All-Brahms
program which was presented in
Herrick chapel by the Grinnell
college department of music,

Robert Vagner. clarinetist, ac-
companied at the piano by Sarah
lnness MacDonald, opened the
program with the Sonata, op.
120, No. 1, [or clarinet and piano,
This work, which was, probably,
with the exception of the slightly
emotional second movement, pain-
fully pedantic to the average
‘unmusical" listener, was well
performed by the artist. in spite
of its general difficulty in execu»
tion.

lnte mezzo, op. 117, .No. 2
for piano, was performed by Miss
MacDonald with the technical
skill and understanding of an arts
ist. The other three numbers of
her group seemed, however, to
lack true Warmth in interpreta-
tion.

The four songs sung by Glenn
F, Most were among the high
ights of the evening. His inter»
pi-etation of Vierrat, which is the
only example of Brahms setting a
ballad dealing with very dramatic
actions to music, was in keeping
with the mood of the song. He
presented Botschaft as the come
poser conceived it, one of the
only “perfect" love songs ever
written.

The Quartet, op. 26, played by
Miss MacDonald, pianist, David
E. Peck, violinist, Margaret Bent-
ley strong, violist, and George
L. Pierce, violoncellist, which
showed well the conflicting
rhythms and melodic ideas that
are so typical of the works of
Brahms, was well performed.

TONSILS REMOVED

Robert Dorauiy, Langan hall
resident, had his tonsils removed
at the Community hospital Mon-
day,
