BY SHIRES PHILLIPS.

Dick Phillips, one of the most out-
standing speakers of the country.
acted as chairman of the Spaulding
speaking contest in Herrick chapel
Wednesday evening, May 21.

In addition to being a speaker of
note, Phillips is probably the smoothw
est and clevcrest actor in the state
of Iowa. He has/Carried to the peak
of success every play in which he
has taken part, and he has been in
the leading role of all the best plays
iven since he has been a student in

rinnell college

Among the few mighty successes
. which Phillips has played are:
'Windows," “Empelol‘ Jones,”
“Romeo and Juliet,” "AS You Like
It," and “Take It or Leave It—
Alone,"

Fhillips has reached the throne of
glory in speech work here, having
been on the varsity debate teams for
three years, was winner of both the
Spaulding and Hill speech contests,
and acted as Master of Ceremonies
at the famous Brown Derby Drag.

In addition to these few honors,
Dick was elected as one of the six
most popular men in college last
winter. He has been Master Coun—
cilor of the Grinnell Chapter Order
of DeMolay for two terms, and re-
ceived the highest honor that De-
Molay can confer in the Legion of
Honor degree which he now holds.
(Activities to be continued.)

Ed Allen got ﬁrst in the contest
Wednesday, Frank Hertel got
second, and Clarence Cooper took
third, Each man got a money
award. The meeting closed at about
nine o’clock.

This column, always being in-

ed the list of new liable at the
library. We were greatly sur—
prised to ﬁnd such a Valuable
Work as "The Weight and How
To Control It."
Spring days are here again and
quadrangle girls are spending sleepe
less nights listening to Gene Grounds
pray for the wings of an angel or
one little hour with you. Both will
be granted him willingly, if he will
only stop his requests before three.

It is with a kindly spirit that
Eleanor Johnson spoke when
she reminded one of the faculty
of the possible effect of a bald
head exposed to the sun. Her
thoughtfulness prevented a had
accident.

Notice: This is absolutely the last
bit of publicity that Miss Johnson
will receive until the account of last

at the most successful ﬁre of
the spring season, Mr. Fuller and
Mr. Soesbe, a couple of “Dibble

pajamas are now the proper at—

who are in the habit of attend-

like to keep Cool through it all.
