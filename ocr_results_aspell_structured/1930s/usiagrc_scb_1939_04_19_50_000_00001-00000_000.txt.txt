Mystery Auto
Found in ARI'I;
Baffies Coeds

By Willow Bat-Moi;

Did you know that there was an
automobile on the second floor of
the Alumni Recitation hall? Well,
maybe not a complete automobile.
it may not have a motor. on sec-
ond thought, it may not even
have a body. Come to think of
it, the wheels are missing too,
and it would take a good set of
eyes to find the radiator cap.

‘Howevel', our machine does have

a steering wheel, gear shift, and
hand-brake.

This mystery machine is the
brain»child of Bill Seidler, and
was constructed by him for the
purpose of timing the reaction
speed of motorists and to see if
he can draw any conclusion as
to whether the r action time has
anything to do with the number
of accidents that a motorist has
had. (Ed. note. Where Seidlel‘ex—
pects to find any motorists around
this campus is beyond me. On
second though, there are a few
illegal drivers to be found around
town.)

The main thing that Seidler
has discovered is that women. on
the whole, are slower than men
taking the test. One interesting
fact was that it took one coed
about 50 seconds to take the test,
while a fairly good time is Considr
ered to be about 25 seconds This
same coed (no names mentioned)
has had three minor accidents
since she has been driving. Re»
action time may not be the prin—
ciple cause in this case, however.
“She said her average speed on
the highway was 55 miles per
hour," said Seidler.

Southern Gentlemen Will Play

Brown Derby’

executed his campaign on this
side of the Mason-Dixon line the
way the Southern Gentlemen
have, the South would have won
the war between the states,

In addit' n to "The Southern
Gentlemen,” the Brown Derby
this year will feature the tradia
tional awards, including the
Brown Derby and the Brown
Bonnet, to the senior man and
women who get through school
the best with the least work; the
Dovcs and Rabbits for amateur
and professional lovers; the
Leather Medal and the Rite for
the longest male and female lines;
and the Blanket and Pillow for
obvious reasons.

According to Whitley, negotia-
tions for a surprise event are
now being can'lcd on as well as
a search for a talented master of
ceremonies. Tickets for the
dance will go at the same price
this year, $2.50 in advance and

 

 

Robert E. Lee had planned and

$3.00 at the door, Whitley said.
