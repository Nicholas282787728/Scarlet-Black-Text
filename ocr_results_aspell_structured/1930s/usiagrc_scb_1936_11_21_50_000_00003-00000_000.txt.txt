It seems well at this time
to clearly state that anything
appearing in any sports col-
umn of the Scarlet rind Black
is not to be construed as be— ‘
ing an expression of the edi-
torial policy of the paper.
The subject was brought up
because it is one that has
been appearing annually on
the campus, and I believe 1
that a wholesome and frank
discussion of the question
may lead to the eventual sol-
ution of it.
