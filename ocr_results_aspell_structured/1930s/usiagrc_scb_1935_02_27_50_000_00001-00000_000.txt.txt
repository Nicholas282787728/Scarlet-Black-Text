Grinnell Takes Final Home
Game by 33—20 Score;
Oliphanl Stars

By RALPH GLIDDEN
Playing a mediocre game which was
punctured by occasional flashy drives,
the Pioneer basketball team easily
downed Coe college, 33 to 20, last
night in their final home appearance
of the year.

The fast breaking Kohawk offense
clicked early in the game. but after
gaining a tie at fivc.all midway in the
first period, the Pioneers forged ahead
and kept their lead the rest of the
contest. Although their smooth pass.
ing game gave them control of the
ball much of the time. inability to
hit the hoop kept the Kohawks from
threatening in the later stages.

Crinncll Piles up Lead

Enjoying a 12 to 9 lead at the half,
the Pioneers held their opponents
without a field goal in the second per.
iod until they piled up a 32 to 12
lead late in the game, the three Coe
points coming on free throws. After
Captain Mason and Klepfer left the
game on fouls, Galvin, Wilkinson and
Quinn found the basket to bring the
Coe total to 20.

scour: BOARD FOOLED ‘EM,
According to members of the
team, the Pioneers were the victims
of circumstance rather than poor
strategy in their game against
Washington last Friday. Although
they did hold a three.point advan.
tage with 45 seconds to go, the score
board did not reveal this margin,
and at the close of the regular play.
ing period showed Washington the
winner instead of a tie score. This.
and not “burn guessing,” was the
reason that the Grinnell quintet
failed to stall,

Galvin gave Coe an early lead with
a short heave. but Oliphant retaliated
with a long shot from the side. Gal.
vin then boosted the Count with a free
throw, but Oliphant again' came
through by following in Klepfer’s long
heave for another two—pointer. Kai-n.
mer and Wilkinson contributed Charity
tosses, and Oliphimt added another to
Lie the score. After Klepfei' pushed
in a short heave to put the Pioneers
in front, they were never headed.

Du Moll! on Bench

Du Mont, regular Pioneer guard,
watched most of the game from the
bench because of a recent slight attack
of flu. Coach John c. Truesdale re.
lied on Klepfer at center and shifted
Bauer to the back court.

Cliphant, pioneer forward, led tht
attack with five field goals and a free
throw for a total of 13 points, followed

the past two years, will introduce the
members of the 1935 Grinnell basket.

program of the Cyclone ball. which

Crayne has received numerous
honors for his play on the lowa teams
both in 1933 and 1934, His most re.
cent honor was his selection aslowa’s
Outstanding Amateur athlete in a poll
conducted recently by the Des Moines
Register and Tribune.

Most Valuable Player

Earlier in the year Crayne was se.
lected as the most valuable player on
the Iowa team for the 1934 season, and
thereby entered competition for the
Chicago Tribune trophy presented
each year to the most valuable player
in Big Ten football circles.

In both 1933 and 1934 Crayne has
received numerous mentions in all—Big
Ten and all—American selections. He

Drake Doped
to Take Meet

Duke Enters 22 in Valley
Meet at Des Moines

'l‘wenty.two men have been entercd
by Lester Duke, track coach, in the
Missouri Valley indoor track and field
meet to be held Saturday at the Drake
field house, From these entries 18
or 19 will be selected to compete in
the meet.

Preliminaries in the quarter mile,
the half mile, and the broad jump will
be run off Saturday morning at the
fieldhouse, while the finals in all
events will lake place in the afternoon.

Only six schools will compete satur.
day. Creighton will be unrepresented.

Bulldogs Favored

Drake is expected to win the meet,
according lo Duke, Judging from
early season performances of (he
Drake squad, the Bulldogs have anolh.
el' well balanced team, being especi.
ally strong in the quarter. mile—the
event in which Grinnell likewise has
strength. Consequently, this event is
expected to be one of the features of
the meet.

In addition to having a strong squad,
the Drake runners enjoy En advantage
in competing on their own track and
of being the only school i the circuit
which has adequate facilities for in.
door workouts.

Gnnncll Probable Second

Grinnell should place second, Duke
believes, if none of the southern
schools reveal unexpected strength.

Since only Drake and Grinnell have
engaged in actual competition, it is
impossible to estimam the strength of
the other three contenders for the in.
door title, However, Washington is
reputed to be especially strong in the
