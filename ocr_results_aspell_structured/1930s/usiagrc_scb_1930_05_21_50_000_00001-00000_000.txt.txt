Track Artists

of Conference
to Meet Here

Washington and Drake Lead
Scoring on Advance
Dope Sheets.

Grinnell Threatens

Bears Send Large Squad to Valley
Outdoor Athletic Carnival;
Welsh to Officials.

Since the morose predictions of
Coach G. Lester Duke have‘broug'ht
Grinnell a series of nine cénsecutlve
victories in dual track meets and two
indoor titles, campus opinion still
finds room to hope that the Pioneers
may take the blue ribbon honors in
the Missouri Valley conference out-
door meet here Friday and Saturday,
although the men will be competing
against some fast competition and
stand only a slight chance of Willa
ning.

Advance dope shows that Drake
and Washington have the best
chances in the loop for a first place.
with Grinnell and Oklahoma likely
to break in at second or third.

Coach Davis of Washington is
making a desperate bid for the con-
ference title, entering the largest
squad in the outfit, twenty—one men.
Grinnell will have nineteen compet-
ing, Drake fifteen and the Oklahoma
Aggies twelve. Creighton, who is al-
most without a track team this sea«
son, will Send only Captain Barron.
Pablu and Sheridan.

Preliminaries Friday

The preliminaries of the meet will
he held Friday afternoon with the
finals on Saturday afternoon. Pete
‘Velsh will serve as referee and Start-
er.

Drake will probably get away for
a fast start in the meet with a quar-
tet of firsts. «Captain Curry is ex-
pected to lead both dashes, While
Podrebarac seems to be a likely bet
in the hurdles. Snorf, who gave
Drake hurdle points in the indoor
session, is out of competition but
there will be Penso to be rated
among the Bulldog barrier men,
Hensley of Grinnel! is likely to nab
a place in the highs, while Weber of
Washington and Captain Barron of
Creighton are both sixteen-second
men.

The hurdle situation on the Grin-
nell team has altered recently with
the shift of "Hank” Thomas from the
dashes to the low hurdles. Thomas,
who was expected to shine in the
sprints this season, has failed to im-
prove over the short distances, while
John Edwards is showing better
times constantly. Coach Duke has
taken advantage of this turn of ai-
fairs to dump Thomas into the low-
hurdles, where he appears to show
some class. He will run with the
milearelay team and compete in the
broad-jump and javelin-throw, also.
