Payne Speaks
to Journalists

Professor Advocates Soviet
Recognition as One

Economic Aid

Recognition of Russm to relieve the
present international economic crisis
was one of the four means suggested
by Charles E. Payne, professor of
history, in his talk before Sigma
Delta Chi Thursday noon at the Vare
sity tearoom. Mr. Payne listed as the
other three alleviating adjustments a
method of price stabilization. 2t con-
current effort of all nations to re
duce the tariff, and the complete
abolishment of reparation payments.

“Governmental recognition of Rus-
sia does not necessarily imply either
approval or disapprovaliit simply
indicates that the Soviet is the operr
ating government. The fact that .the
ratio of our export balance of trade
With Russia last year was 4:1 is re-
markable. How a governmental
recognition of Russia would change
this ratio must remain an estimate,”
said Mr. Payne.

The fact that ﬁnancial leaders re-
miiin impervious to the injustice that
Germany’s sons are paying for their
father's debts is perhaps the most
pertinent reason that reparations
have not been cancelled. Mr. Payne
likewise brought out that a decrease
in the tariff level was impossible by
one nation’s action. An international
economic conference would be the
only method of approaching that.

Members of the fraternity will
initiate pledges next Thursday after-
noon. Mel: to enter Sigma. Delta. Chi
at that time are Frank Flll'bush,
Harold Forrester, James Morrison,
and Stan Hipp.

HE whole country is talking about the throat-
easy mildness and the prime freshness of Camel
Cigarettes in the new Humidor Pack.

The above chart prepared by the Pittsburgh Testing
Laboratory tells you why.

Please examine it carefully. It is an unfailing guide
to cigarette selection and enjoyment.

As you can quickly see by lhe three upper eurveeon
this interesting Chart, cigarettes that lack the protec-
tion of the Humidor Pack lose their moisture rapidly
from the day they are manufactured.

And day by day as this moisture disappears, the
smoke from these ”cigarettes becomes harsher, hotter,
more unkind to the snloloer’s throat.

Not so with Camels!

The Humidor Pack is moisture proof and sealed air-
tight at every point. it protects the rich, ﬂavorful

smoke a

aroma of the choice Turkish and Domestic tobaccos
of which Camels are blended.

Rluke these tests yourself

it in so easy to tell the diﬁ'erence between parched dry
cigarettes and fresh prime Camels that it ie no wonder
everybody is reaching for afresh cigarette today.

Your ﬁngers identify stale,dried—out tobaccos at once.
While a Camel is ﬂexible and pliant.

Your cars can tell the diiIerence too. For :- dust-dry
cigarette crackles under pressure.

But the real test is taste and there is simply no com-
parison between the rich mildness of a Camel and the
hot, brackish smoke from a stale, dry cigarette.

Switch to Camels just for today then leave them
tomorrow if you can.
