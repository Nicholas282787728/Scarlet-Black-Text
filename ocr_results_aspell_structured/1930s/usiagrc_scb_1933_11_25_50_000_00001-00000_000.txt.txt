Not Much
Change Found
in Men‘s Clothes

How much money does the aver-
age Crinnell man carry about with
him on the campus?

Slightly more than 90 cents, ac-
cording to an investigation carried
on by The Scarlet and Black yesterﬁ
day.

Fifteen men from each of the six
men’s balls were asked the question,
“How much money are you carrying
with ‘you at the present time?” A toe
tal of $79.42 was the sum of the as
answers (two Dibble magnates were
disqualified for carrying too much).

Dibble hall established itself as
the financial center of the dormi-
tories, according to the results of
the poll, Two future capitalists en-
gaged in making laundry and clean-
ing collections were responsible for
Dibble's holding $140.81. However,
the 13' normal individuals 3114
proached, possessed only $5.31 among
them.

At the other extreme, Smith was
the poorest hall, with its 15 repre~
scntativcs possessing a total of 64
cents. Rawson was a close second,
with $1.94 in the pockets of its mem-
bers.

Progressing from the poorer to the
richer halls, Gates men were carry-
ing $7.18 with them; Langan pos-
sessed 527,33; and Clark mon, disc
counting the claims of ”Harpo Clal'x”
to the possession of $25, had $35.02
in their pockets.

Tentative Plans
for Disk Recitdl
Wednesday Made

Hope that a concert of some of the
recorded selections which make up a
part of the musical library recently
donated to the college by the Car-
negie Foundation,,might be presented
Wednesday as part of the Thanksgiv-
ing program was expressed yesterday
by David E. Peck, professor of violin.

All the equipment, including a
large Capchart phonograph, has been
delivered at the music building, and
plans for the opening of the new li—
brary are beginning to take shape.
According to Professor Peck, the li—
brary will be open for an hour and
a half each week-day afternoon, and
probably all day Saturday, He re-
marked that one night a week will
probably be set aside for a regular
program. “

All of the records have been in—
stalled in special albums which fit
into a wooden case that was included
in the equipment. The scores are
filed in a steel cabinet and shelves
will be provided for the books which
complete the library.

Records from England. France,
Germany and ltaly, as well as num-
bers produced by American phono-
graph companies, arc included among
the 324 selections. Professor Pcck es-
timates the total value of the gift
to be between $2,500 and $3,500.

While the library will he used by
the music students in their studies,
all students will be encouraged to
make usc of the phonograph and
records, Professor Peck stated. He
expressed the belief that the prac-
tice of the college in making good
music available to all the students,
by means of the annual student and
professional recital courses and in
chapel music programs, was mainly
responsible for the selection of Grin-
ncll for the donation.
