Faculty Divided
on Open Stacks

(Continued From Page 1)
ness administration: "The stacks, in
my opinion, should not be open to the
entire student body, but each mem-
ber of the.fscnlty should be provided
with permit slips which he could
give to research students and others
doing reference work to allow them
to enter the stacks. While the catalog
is very useful, a person doing refer»
ence work must be able to enter the
stacks to get full benefit."

William H. Mack, professor of Eng-
lish: “I think it is up to the students.
If they earnestly desire re-admittance
to the stacks. I believe they have it
within their power to create such e
sentiment against mutilating and
purloining the books as would make
it reasonably safe and generally de~
sirahle to remove some of the pres-
ent restrictions.”

Frederick L. Baumaum, professor
‘of history: "I am in favor of closed
stacks to students, because it is the
best way, in my opinion, of seeing
that students get the books. Under
the open stack system when hun—
dreds of books a year disappeared,
the student was- the ultimate loser."

Grinnell Proves

Claim to Oldest
College in West

Grinnell college, which was the
first institution west of the Missis—
sippi river to grant a degree of
bachelor of arts, was founded at Dav-
enport in 1848, and incorporated as
Iowa college. The first commence-
merit exercises were held there in
1354, when two students were grad-
uated.
Iowa Wesleyan college at Mt.
Pleasant claimed through its student
newspaper to be the “oldest cols
lege west of the Mississippi," but
an investigation by The Scarlet and
Black disclosed that although that
institution was founded in 1842, it
was founded as a mission and pre-
paratory school.

First to Give Degree
It was not until after the founding
of Grinnell that Iowa Wesleyan offer-
ed college courses, and it did not
grant a college degree until three
years after Grinnell.
Those who were instrumental in
the founding of Grinnell were 12 men,
graduates of Yale university, and
known as the Iowa band. Plans for
the organization which were finally
completed in 1846, were begun three
years previous to that time.

Still “Iowa College"
In 1359 the college sold its prop-
erty at Davenport and moved to
Grinnell, at which time women were
admitted to the college. The ﬁrst de-
gree granted by Grinnell to a woman
was in 1867 to Joanna Harris Haines,
who died here last summer, and
for whom Cottage Four of the quad-
rangle was dedicated last commence:
ment.
The name of the college was later
changed to Grinneil, but it is still in-
corporated as Iowa college. John S.
Nollen is the ﬁfth president of the
institution.

Lanlern Members Favor
Opening of Lilirury Stacks
Advisahility of afternoon study
hours was a major problem discussed
by Lantern at its regular meeting
held Wednesday night in the dormi-
tory dining room. The organization
decided to offer its assistance to the
council of house chairmen in bring-
ing about regular quiet hours,

Reopening of the library stacks
was-connidcrcd, aha re «unreserved
that the house councils should assist
librarians in watching hooks. Lane
tern also discussed the need for a
central auditing committee to audit
accounts of campus organizations,
and a committee consisting of Wall-
ace Henderson and Fillmore GWynDe<
Vaughan was appointed to investi—
gate central auditing system possi-
bilities. The problem of properly
lighting the campus was brought up,
and Dewitt McCreary was asked to
investigate the situation.

Grinnell chapter of National Col-
legiate Players, Pi Epsilon Delta,
honorary dramatic fraternity. was
organized in the spring of 1923, and
formally installed in May of that
year. The local chapter was spans
sored by Mrs. ottilie Seybolt, then
director of drama here. It supercod»
ed the dramatic club which had been
long established on the campus.

At the time of the Grinnell chap-
ter’s installation there was only one
other chapter in Iowa, at Iowa State
college, Ames. Since that time a
third chapter has been established at
Cornell college, Mount Vernon, fuls
filling the allotment for this state.

Must Show Interest

Pi Epsilon Delta stands as a na—
tional college fraternity devoted to
the promotion of best individual and
group efforts in drama. It recog-
nizes worthwhile accomplishment in
all phases of drama, but insists
that members be sufficiently inter-
ested in drama to have participated
in at least two fields,

The local chapter annually spans
sors at least two dramatic performr
ances. and in the last three years has
produced Galsworthy’s “Windows,"
O'Neill’s “The Emperor Jones," and
last year, “The Perfect Alibi," by a.
A. Milne. This year its homecoming

SURE! When a word ﬁts, you know it!
“Satisfy” just ﬁll CHESTERFIELD. A smoker
picks up a package, and he likes its heat appear-
ance —— no heavy inks or odors from ink. Thai
satisﬁes him.

Then he examines a Chesterﬁeld. It is well-
ﬁlled; it is neat in appearance; the paper is pure
white. And that satisﬁes him.

He lights up. At the very ﬁrst puﬁ‘ he likes
the ﬂavor and the rich aroma. He decides that
it mm le/Ier— neither law nor over-sweet; just

Then he learns it is milder. That’s another
Way of saying that there is nothing irritating
about it. And again he‘s inhaled!

Satisfy— they’ve gal to satisfy! The right to»

right. Everything that goes into CHESTER—
