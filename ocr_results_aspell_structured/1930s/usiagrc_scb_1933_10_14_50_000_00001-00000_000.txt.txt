to Organize Collectors’

Club on Campus

Numerous specimens of stamps
from every period in the history oi

sent to or from famous personages,
constitute the chief part of the volu-
minous stamp collection of John M.
Bridgham, professor of Latin.

Professor Bridgham has been an

10 years old, but in recent years hr
has devoted his efforts chiefly to ac-
quiring Amcrican issues.

One to Barnum

Among his collection of old stamps
and envelopes are several addressed
to Alexander H. Stephens, vice-
president of the Confederate states
during the Civil war; one addressed
in carc of P. T. Bamum at the win—
ter quarters of his circus; several
Carried by Charles A. Lindbergh the
first time he flow the mall in 1926,
and a letter written by John Green»
leaf Whittier in the '70’5.

Inasmuch as stamp collecting is a
hobby of recognized merlt, command.

ing the enthusiastic participation of
no lcss a person than President
Roosevelt, Professor Bridgham plans
to organize a stamp collecting club
among students who nre interested
in the pastime. He intends to get
the club established early in Decem-
ber, and to hold meetings perhaps
twice a month.

An interesting letter in the profesV
sor-s collection was written by Hor—
ace Greeley, famous journalist, to a
Detroit political boss before the Civil
war. Greciey’s notoriety as a pen»
man ls.more than verified by this
document, which is practically inde-
cipherable except at the beginning,

In the opening paragraph, Grecley
says that he has no recollcction of a
loan the politician claims to have
made to him, but indicates, however,
that he will take the “boss ' word
for it.

Professor Bridgham's most higliiy
prizcd cnvclope is one addressed to
the Confederate Vice-president at
Crawfordsville, Georgia, in 1365, A
newspaper item in his possession
proves that this letter was sent just
beforc Union soldiers arrested sto—
phens at Crawfordsville, following
Lee's surrender.
