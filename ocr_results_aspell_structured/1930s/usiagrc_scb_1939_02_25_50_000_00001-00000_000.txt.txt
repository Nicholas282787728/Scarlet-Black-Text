Gl‘innell's insandrout Pioneers
meet the Ichabods from Wash~
burn college tonight in the men’s
gymnasium.

Grinnell ranks the favorite on
the basis of its season's play but
if its performance against Tulsa
Thursday is an indicator of its
present form. Washhurn will be
the victor.

Poor Play.

Against Tulsa, Coach Trues-
dale's men literally threw the
ball game away with their poor
play. They let the invaders snatch
a 20 to 15 advantage away from
them at the start of the second
half. careless passing caused in-
terceptions and set up baskets on
quick breaks for the opponents.

When the horn ended the game,
Tulsa was on the long end of a
39 to 33 count and had knocked
Grinnell's hope for at least a tie
for second place in the Valley for
a complete loop,

A Present Slump.

The results tonight against
Washburn and Monday night
against Creighton will depend en»
tirely upon whether the cagers
can snap out of their present
slump, A lot will depend upon
whether Fred Luther's knee can
stand the strain of the frequent
competition

Against Tulsa. he gave the in-
jured member another bad knock
and was temporarily forced to
leave the game. The nature of the
injury forces him to favor his leg
while he plays, and, as a result,

Lattimore Decries Foreign Interference
Preventing Chinese National Integration

The greatest problem in the his
tory of the Chinese nation has
always been the network of
treaties with other countries
which have had the effect of pre-
venting national unity. Owen Lats
timore, history lecturer, declared
in, his third address on interna-
tional affairs in Herrick chapel
Wednesday evening.

In explaining the cause for the
lack of integration and unity, Lat-
timoi-c asserted that because of
these restrictive treaties, which
have often given foreign nations
valuable concessions, China has
always had too many fronts to
fight against to be successful,
Japanese Economic Control.

In the last 30 years, China has
increasingly become a Japanese
empire in the matter of economic
control, Lattimore said.

Railroads, banking and manu-
facturing have come more and
more under Japanese dominance,
and it is because of this internal
control in China that she has
found little difficulty in seizing
Manchuria without strong resist-
ance.

Treaty Restrictions.

Although Japan has never told
China in so many words, "You
must do this” in the treaties, she
has, on the other hand, said, "You
can’t do that."

Hopkins, in Political Eye, Leaves Grinnell; Faculty
Finals Him a Likable, Competent Government Oﬁ‘icial

 

By John Malian.

Harry Hopkins is gone, but he
left a very definite impression
here in Grinnell where he was a
guest for three days

Secretary Hopkins is still being
discussed by everyone, but all of
the ideas of him are the same
with students and professors
when his personality is brought
up for discussion

The predominant idea is that
he is the kind of a person one
likes to have around.

During his stay here, Hopkins
at chapel.
He met most of the students at a
reception at the home of the
president Wednesday evening, so
everyone had a chance to meet
him.

In his chapel talk, Hopkins
seemed to be one of us, not a
high government official, He was
just another Grinnellian, His talk,I
although in a light vein. had many
meanings.

Hopkins was well reccivcd by
the faculty as statements of some
of the following membel show:

“I think his pcech was in good

 

temper, there w , a good spirit of,

interest, and it was quite appro-
priate," said John w. Gannaway,
professor of political science, ”MT.
Hopkins appeared to me as if he
was quite tired, and a little
weary."

Garrett P. Wyckoff, professor
of sociology, when asked his opln-
ion was quoted as saying, “His
chapel talk was quite a masteo
picce: it was of interest to us
and everyone, He started in a
genial mood, and broadened out
in the coursc of the talk. He is
coming along toward greatness
very rapidly, and we are all won-
derfully pleased with his work in
this larger ficlr

“It is good for young Grinnell
to see what some of mu graduates
have achieved. His talk seemed
very sincere and was quite inter
esting. He had a fine personality
and was pleasing to everyone,"
asserted Donald F. Grass, pro-
fessor of business administration.

When asked for n statement,
Robert H. Norton, instructor in
history, am. “Mr. Hopkins im—
pi- r 1 me as being a very likable
and interesting person with a
great native w

 

“He seemed like a fellow you’d
like to talk to, His chapel talk
was extremely interesting, but
wasn‘t one of his great talks."

There is no doubt that Hop—
kins was on the spot while here,
Evelyone was watching every
move he made, not only here, but
all over the country Politicians
wcrc calefully noting all he did.
However, Hopkins came through
with flying colors and passed
every test.

He won the people in this "hot
bed of Republicanism," After doe
ing this, he left no doubt in our
mind that ho is the competent
man he is reputed to be, and the
man for the important job with
which President Roosevelt has on-
trusted him,

At the half of the basketball
game Thursday night, Harry Hope
kins was tapped as the first lion»
oral-y member 0[ Friars, senior
men's hollol'ai'y scholastic socict
Thc honor was awarded by Fr
ci-ick Homaim, president of the
organization.

Hopkins also presented Honor
“G” blanket winners with their
awards at the half of the game.
