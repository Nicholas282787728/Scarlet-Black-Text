Streaks of Brilliance.

At times the play of both
teams showed streaks of brilliance
and frequent signs of early season
roggedness. Capt. Robert Berry
and John Turner, veteran guards,
were both forced out of the game
in the second half.

James Nash, David Miller and
‘George Tompkins, performing as
substitutes, turned in creditable
performances.

Pelsner starts.

The veteran Wilbur Luick at
center showed signs of a recent
illness in his general all-around
play, but was second high scorer
on the team with nine points and
played a good game under the
basket. '

Gene peisner, another sopho»
mor with Fort at the forward
pos ens, played an excellent floor
game and contributed six points
to the evening's total.

Substitutes Frequently.

Defensive play. particularly of
Berry and Turner, was exceptions
ally good for the first game of
the year, In the first ten mine
utes of the second half, the Fio—
neers limited Coe to only four
points while they scored 15 points
to take a 32 to 22 lead and put
the game on ice.

The balance of the game found
coach Truesdale substituting fre-
quently. However, the play of the
make-shift lineup was good
enough to keep the tenepolnt lead
and wind up the contest with a
as to 23 victory,
