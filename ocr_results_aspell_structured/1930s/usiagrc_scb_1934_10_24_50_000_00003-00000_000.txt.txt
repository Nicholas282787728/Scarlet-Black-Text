Games on Schedule

DES MOINES, 1a., (Spocial)~Fi~id
night football this week will in-
together four Missouri valley con
ference teams in two games wh"
will go a long way in settling the
title scrap ior this year.

At St. Louis, Mo., Jimmy Conzel»
man’s Washington club, nosed ou'
only by Illinois this year, has a datc
with Drake—a date to which the
Bears have been looking forward all
year. Drake waited until last weal:
to score is first victory of the sea
son, 8.0, over Grinnell. and the Bulls
dogs will bedecided underdogs at
St, Louis.

Bears Favored

in this game Washington is expect.
ed to shoot the works from the star|
in a supreme effort to break thr
Bulldog iin which has beaten the
BSars every time they've played since
world war daysﬁnd they’ve played
10 games since 1918 when Washington
last won, 26-0. An indication as to
the likelihood of a Washington victory
was had last Saturday when the
Bears walloped Simpson, a team that
had lied Drake, 27 to 0.

The other Valley game Friday brings
into action the championship Okla—
homa Aggies and Creighton, still Seek.
ing its first victory of the year. The
game will be at Stillwater, Okla.
Both contestants had a bitter taste of
Southwestern conference football last
week, the Cowboys losing by the large
est score in years to Southern Metho-
dist, 41.0, and Creighton’s homecom.
ing being wrecked by Rice Institute,
47 to 13.

Grinnell vs. Haskell

Grinnell, despondent over a com.
plete absence of triumphs this year
and last, entertains Haskell Friday
night. The Indians were held to a
scoreless tie by the Pioneers last
year in the only game which Grinnell
hasn‘t lost in two seasons.

Tulsa journeyed to Washington, D.
C. last week and found powerful
George Washington U. a bit too
strong, losing 10—0. The Hurricane

Okla. Washbul'n, idle last week.
meets Kansas state Teachers at Em.
