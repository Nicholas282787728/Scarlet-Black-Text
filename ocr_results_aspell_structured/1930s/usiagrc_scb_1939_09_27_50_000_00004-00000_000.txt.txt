The opener wrth Monmouth was
a typical opening game with
numerous misplays by both teams.
However, in many instances both
teams looked good, Outstanding
for the Pioneers were Capt. How-
and Crimes hard tackling, Robert
Hamann’s kicking and passing,
and Ed Walters’ pass receiving.
Hainann kicked ten times for an
average of 40 yards. This included
a 70 yard boot. Walters caught
the two touchdown passcs.

field generalship by waiters was
satisfactory, The linemen's fail-

and opening of holes was good.
