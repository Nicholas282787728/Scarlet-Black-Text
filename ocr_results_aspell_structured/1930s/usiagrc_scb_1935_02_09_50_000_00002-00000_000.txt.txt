FENCE» STRADDLING.

Says Editor Don Pryor of the University of
Iowa Daily Iowan when queried as to who was
sponsoring the Iowa vote in the current peace poll
being promoted by the Association of College
Editors and The Literary Digest, “The Daily
Iowan has ignored repeated requests to join such
campaigns becausel am Strenuously opposed to
bilowing this paper to be used as an organ of pro—
paganda or publicity for. anyone, whether I
agree with him or not.” For this stand, the Iowa
Legionairc writes, “we figuratively gave him a
pat on the back,"

liaban shoemaker

From the organ of a group that is so ever-active
in spreadng propaganda this comment seems odd,
to say the least; but let that be as it may.
We feel, however, that we must take exception to
thé' attitude of Mr, Pryor, both in his interpreta-
tion of the purpose of the peace poll, and of the
purpose of a college paper. -

The sponsors of the college poll admittedly
hope; to reveal a strong sentiment for “pacifism,”
as the Legion terms it, and so far the results of
the vote have justified their hope. But why, just
because the tide of the Voting is anti-militaristic,
should the movement be condemned as mere
propaganda? Why would not the results be pubs
lished just the same if the vote showed the
opposite trend? The purpose of the poll is simply
to reveal a sentiment which already exists. not
to influence the opinions of the students per
ticipating in the voting. This, surely, is not
propaganda. '

But, on the other hand, what if it were? Why
should'not the purpose of the college paper, the
same as. any other, be to direct the opinion of its
readers? How much longer the Boss Tweed reign
in New York would have existed had not a New
York paper aroused its readers into action. Did not.
the notorious conditions in Florida prison camps
persist until newspapers took a hand in the matter'.7
Many ,more examples of the beneficial results of

\newspaper campaigns might be citedibut they
were not attained by publications which refused
to take a stand.

The college newspaper, if it pretends to qualr
ify for the name, has an equal responsibility to
bring about: beneficial changes. In world or
national affairs, of course; it can exert only in-
consequential inﬂuence—unless it joins in a con-
certed movement involving many school publica-

THE GEINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

tions throughout the country. This, while we still
insist the A. C. E. peace ballot cannot be classified
as strictly propaganda, is the method being ems
ployed in the poll.

We fell that college papers are obligated to
take a stand on questions of moment even if it
amounts to nothing more'than' a futile gesture.
We Cannot join the Legionairc’s approval of Editor
Pryor‘s fence-straddling.

the second semester—which brings
with it swimming (3 1e pool), valentines, the
Colonial Ball—and class elections. And “class
elections" brings to mind the prolonged process,
with postponement after postponement, which the
election of the various sergeants-atni-ms et 31
involved last semester, ,

Comes

It so happens that there is an element. of pur-
pose behind the second semester elections of the
senior and junior classes. The Senior and Jun.
for proms are in the offing. and of course someone
must be selected to make arrangements for thc
two dances.

BUTiwhy the freshmen and sophomores
should voluntarily launch into the ordeal of class
election for the sole purpose of qualif ii; a half-
dozen classmates to pad out their personal activ-
ity lists in Cyclones of the future with a recital of
class honors they have held is, to say the least,
mystifying. It seems an immense price to pay
for devotion to such a worthless cause.

The classes of ’37 and ’38 would be doing
future underolassmen an immense service if they
would take the initiative in the matter and abane
don the obsolete custom of electing lower class
officers.

UNCLE SAM OUT OF STEP

In a recent popular vote in England surpris-
ing results were brought forth in regard to the
English people’s attitude toward the League of
Nations. One of the questions submitted to thc
people queried whether or not England should
remain in the League.

From the figures thus far available it i-
estimated that the percentage in favor of remains
ing in the League of Nations will be 90 per cal
England has always been one of the locale
the movement for international peace, but it is
doubtful if ever before British sentiment has been
so strong in support of the League.

, In addition to showing not only the attitude
of, the British people, the vote aroused a move-
ment in France for a vote along similar lines.
France, like England, has been an ardent support—
er of the League, and if the results in France are
anywhere near as decisive as they were in Eng-
land it will be more than evident that there is
powerful support of the League. The final out-
come of the French vote cannot be definitely to
dicted, but in all likelihood it will closely parallel
the result of the English poll; there has been a
growing agitation against war, sponsored by a
powerful group of ex-soldiers in France who are
heartily opposed to legalized slaughter.

The United States seems intent upon adher-
ence to its traditional policy of isolation in WOT
affairs; or so the recent rejection of membership
in the World Court implies, While an attempt
to stem this trend toward international Coopera-
tion was probably furtherest from their thoughts
when the members of Congress took their stand
on Court membership, the result of the action
may he the equivalent of such an attempt. With
such concrete evidence of French and English
willingness to cooperate in the search for world
peace, United State’s stand seems doubly selfish
and ignoblc.

CHAPEL
NOTES

in an attempt to show thc unanimity
of the various religions that have been
existent in thc world at different times,
W. J. Rusk. professor of mathematics,
at chapel Wednesday quoted the fun.
damental precepts of several religions,
including Buddahism, Confucianism,
Christianity, and Mohammedanism.
This precept is, in effect, “do unto oth.
ers, as you would have them do unto
you," he stated.

He went on to say that a man’s re.
ligion is his behavior towards his fel.
low man. “In a larger sense, life and
religion are synonymous,” He then
pointed out, “every man has a the.
clogy. A man’s theology is an attempt
to rationalize his religion.”

Professor Rusk continued, saying,
“philosophy has often been called the
science of sciences," Yet according
to the speaker, “philosophy Works
over foundations of science.”

Thursday he went on to explain the
shake up in our ideas of science. “The
language of science is strange and
shocking. The scientist contends that
the universe is an organism, not a
machine." He has a religion, the
speaker stated, the quality of which
is decided by his behavior.

In speaking of art, he said, we
should not have “art for art’s sake,”
but "art for life's sake.” In connection
with the latter, Professor Rusk contend.
ed that the amount of physical labor
necessary to take care of life will
ultimately be no more than two hours a
day. The rest of the time will be
spent in doing things of spiritual qual.
ity. This is a fundamental urge in
art, he observed.

In conclusion, Professor Rusk declared
that those who work for the love of
it are practicing the fine art of li 'ng,
“Man should live creatively for his
fellow man."

“The race has the choice of selfish.
ncss and death or unselfislmess and
life, which do you wisllY—Are you
willing to pay the price?"

“The lecture by Professor Oscar B,
Jacobson on “The Character of Al’t’
will be one of special interest to slua
dents who know little about art," be—
hech Dr. Edward A. Steiner, professor
of applied Christianity, who enjoys a
personal friendship with the artist
lecturer.

Dr. Steiner expressed this opinion
when asked to tell something of the
work of Professor Jacobson, director
of the school of art at the Univ‘resily
of Oklahoma, who is to speak in Hera
rick chapel next Thursday. He char.
acterized him as a “very brilliant
speaker—not technical,

“He is popular in the sense that
people like to listen to him," Steiner
said. “I think what he has to say will
be very enjoyable and stimulating. He
is a highly cultured man in a broad
sense,”

The school of arts at the University
of Oklahoma has reached a very high
degree of excellence under the direc.
(ion of Professor Jacobson. Steiner
stated, Its faculty now includes 15 in.
structors.

"Probably Professor Jacobson’s
greatest achievement has been in stim.
ulating the production and love of
art in Oklahoma, a young and unde.
vclopcd state. He has stimulated much
artistic work among the prairie In.
dians," he concluded.

Professor Jacobson is scheduled to
speak to the Women’s club in Des
