Metropolitan Opera Star
.- chooses light smoke for his throat

Lauritz Melchior says:

”The hardest test I can give a Ciga—
rette is to try its effect on my throat
after hours of intense rehearsal. I’ve
found that a light smoke meets this
test: And so, although I am not a
constant smoker, l favorLucky Strike ‘
far the sake of my throat. And, inci—
dentally, so does my wife. When we
go back to Europe we never forget to
take along agood supply of Luckies.”

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, 87% stated they personally
prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Melchior veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen, and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh
irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat!
