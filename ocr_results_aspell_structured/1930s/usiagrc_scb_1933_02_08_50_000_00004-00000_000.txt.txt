Glenn Cunningham, who defeated
Gene Verizke in the . namaker Mile
at the annual Millrosc games last
week, is the some Cunningham,
whom Mike rilbrow beat in the
Drake relay two—mile event last
spring. Pubrow nosed out the lion—
sns university star for the runnenip
position to Henry Brocksmith, u-ho
ivon the race. Cunningham’s time it
th- Milli-osc games was 4:13, close to

a record mark.

Pilbrow also beat another nations
ally known figure last spring when
be conquered Clark Chamberlain of
Michigan state, proclaimed by sew
eral sports writers to be the great»
est distance runner ever to set foot
on an American track. Pllbrow came
up from behind at the finish of the
two mile run at the Central Intel's
collegiate meet at South bend, and
so amazed were the coaches and
trainers of Chamberlain that they
protested that Pilbrmv had not run
the required number of laps. This
pretest was readily disallowed, and

rilhrow's fame spread overnight.

the royal possessions until it was

Smokers Better Students

smoking tends to make a student
more composed and aids- him to con!

A special test conducted at the
university showed that smokers,
considered as a group, were better
scholars than non-smokers, he said, -

widow of the violinist, who placed it
with Hill of London for safekeeping.

Occasionally it was loaned to a fri-
mous violinist for his London re-
citals. And that was how Kochanski
became acquainted with it. It was
given to him for his London recital
and he was so impressed with its
beauty of tone that he at onoe opened
