Tebbens Recalls Assigning of Dates
as Campus Custom of 24 Years Ago

Frye Presents Descriptions

of ‘Old Grad' Types
at Chapel Friday

“Recreation hours are from 4:15 to
7:30 unhl Easter when they will be
extended until 8 o'clock." Such was
the freedom of the Grinnell coed but
24 short years ago this Homecoming,
Betty Tebbens, president of the
Women's Sclt Government league, in.
formed the audrcncc at the student
assembly yesterday morning.

Further by-laws governing the
young ladies at Crinnell demanded
that “There shall be no attendance at
dances during the coucge session."
and "On Sundays young women are
expected neither to walk nor drive
with young men, nor to receive calls
from them."

To provide for a more equitable
distrrbution oi the “young men’s“ at—
tentions, each young cavalier was as—

signed a date before campus func—
tions. An editorial in The Scarlet and
Black of that year pled tor “no swaps,"
and that the date be formally inform-
ed if the gentlemen intended to dis»
pose of his obligation by calling at
the appointed hour and place.

Highlights of Homecoming ill the
years 1915 and 1917 were also touched
upon by Miss Tebbens. In the latter year-
“Gi‘innell women could be seen indus»
triously knitting between courses at
dinner, at lectures, house meetings
and even at concerts," she reported
and each cottage had adopted its own
French war orphan.

Concluding with a discussion ol
coed rulings in 1919, Miss Teblwns
made note of the _(act __that at that
time no picnics were held during
mid—weck "except between the hours
of 4:30, and 7:30 p.m.",_ and dances
were still taboocd on the Grinllel!
campus.

in spite of the many injuries which
have been dogging the tracks of the
Wattwoached men this season, lollow~
ers ol the Grinnell team are expecte
ing the first victory sincc thc 1932
season, today.

The two losses which the Pioneers
have sustained were at the hands of
powerful teams re - senting latgc

scarlet and black griddcrs played
heads—up ball to take the short end
of a 33—20 score, while against lowa
State, Grinnell suffered a letdown
from the many injuries of the wool.-

Outstanding work so far this season

ball carrying, Clark in passing and
ball carrying, and Kingery in defen-
sive work at the tailback position.
