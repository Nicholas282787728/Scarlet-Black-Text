...but, after all is said and
done, it’s the cigarette it-

self that Counts

. . . the question is,

does it suit you?

 

Now, when it comes to a cigarette that
will suit you . . . you want to think whether
it’s mild, you want to thin/2 about the taste

That Chesterﬁelds are milder and taste better

is no accident . . . 7
‘ 5'
.. for mildncss
.. for better taste

The farmer who grows the tobacco, the
warehouseman who sells it at auction to the
highest bidder, every man who knows about
leaf tobacco will tell you that it talzcs mild,
ripe tobaccos to maize a good cigarette.

In making Chesterﬁelds we use mild ripe
home-grown and Turkish tobaccos.
