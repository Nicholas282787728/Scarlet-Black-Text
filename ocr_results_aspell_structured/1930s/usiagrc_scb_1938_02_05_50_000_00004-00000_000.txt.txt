MAJOR PROPHETS

For 24 years the Fellowship Conference
during the second. week of February has
been a central feature of our college year,
bringing to the campus for the Gates
Memorial Letures a succession of the
“major prophets” of our time.

The Gates Memorial week will begin at
regular chapel next Monday 9 a. in.
when Dr. Edward A. Steiner will speak of
the spirit and purpose of the memorial. On
Tuesday our guest will be Theodore C.
Hume, young minister of the New England
Congregational church, Chicago, who will
speak at a regular chapel, and at 8 in
the evening will tell lls of the Oxford con—
ference of last year, which was a unique
gathering of the Christian forces of the
world.

Wednesday and Thursday are devoted to
the Gates Lectures by Dr. Albert Edward
Day, the distinguished minister of the First
Methodist church of Pasadena. Dr. Day
will give five lectures, at a "long chapel" at
9:40, at 4:30 and at 8 on Wednesday, again
at a long chapel at 9:40 and finally at 2
pl'm. on Thursday. At the Friday student
chapel Alice Ebeling' and Thomas Keehn

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

will sum up the services of the week from
the students‘ point of view.

THE TWO GRINNELLS

Certain problems are exerting pressure on
Grinnell student life this year, a pressure
that demands release. _

The first of these two pressure in»
flueuces is the two Gl'inllells. We do not
refer here to the alumni and the present
student body. Rather we refer to the ill-
dividual and distinct entities known as the
men and the women of Grinnell.

Perhaps this broad generalization needs
modification. For perhaps 25 per cent of
the student body, the M. and St. L. tracks
provide no barrier to normal, friendly social
and intellectual exchange between men and
women.

The remaining students are comfortably
ignored in the highly touted Grinncll social
system,

This fact is substantiated by house offi-
cers in both dormitory and quadrangle, and
the situation seems particularly bad this
year.

The second bifurcation of the famous
Grinnell personality appears in those who
engage actively ill the Grinnell social whirl
(which consists almost exclusively of
dancing) on the one hand, and those who
have no alternative to this social enigma on
the other.

In other words no compromise has been
made in the Grinnell social program to pro-
vide social entertainment for all.

The Christian associations on this campus
have now taken steps toward alleviating
these problems with mixed dinners and a
new type of party to be held soon. The
sltuatlon is not impossible of solution and
one attempt to do that is at hand.

FALSE sscunu G—

Always we must have a pet peeve and at
present our favorite one is the flagstone
walk which, rising at intervals above the
mud surrounding it, shows the struggling
student the way to the book store steps.

We are of the opinion that the present
walk, with its slimy stones lending a false
air of security from the hazards of a slow
death by drowning in a sea of mud, is more
of a lllenancc than was the original mud
hole, for then those who knew Iowa mud
dld not attempt to negotiate the crossing.

The solution obviously is a real cement
walk. Since the primary aim of the walk
was to confine walking to it and keep
pedestrians off the grass (such as it is) we
suggest that the stones, which it is im—
possible to stay on this weather, are not
fulfilling their purpose, hence the walk
seems logical.

NEWS OF um WORLD
INTERPRETED BY
John Spaulding
BARCELONA, SPAIN—Most
important news of the week in
point of view of lives lost was
the bombing last Sunday of Bar
calona by rebel planes which cost
hundreds of lives. Late this week
the total was estimated at over
400 civilians, men, women and
children dead, and Red Cross

workers were still excavating in
the ruins in Search of others.

VVASHJNGTON. or moi-c im-
mediate importance to Americans,
however, is the revolt of the
small business men called to
Washington last week to confer
with administration officials on
ways cud means to aid business,
which at this writing has thc ad-

Mr. Roosevelt, completely astound-
ed.

The slnnll business men were
expected to side with the admin-
istration in its “trust busting"
program, but they instead ex-
pressed vociferous disapproval of
the administration in general.

Friday the business men came
around to tell President Roosevelt
what they want, Many of their
proposals were approved by the
President when a committee, notr
ably less critical, presented the
program to him.

Foremost iii the list of needs
was an easier method of finding
capital. Other points in the list
of 23 needs include repeal of the
undistriliutcd profits tax, investi—
gation of Wagner act administra-
tion, enforcement of anti-trust
laws and broadening of the in-
come tax base.

BERLIN, GERMANY.—Hitlcr

thc German army and topic steps
to concentrate the powers of guy-
crhmcht in a fcw trusted subor—
dinates in an effort to prevent the

 

Ethc army forced withdrawal of
Minister of War Marshal Werner
Von Blcmbcvg from becoming-
more serious.

Tho origin of the shclrcup,
which has all Europe in fear of an
aggressive campaigi by Germany,
dates back to Jan. 12 when Von
‘Blumberg married the “socially
impossible” daughter of a par
pcnter.

WASHINGTON—J. \v .1 r r o 11
Madden, chairman of the Nation-
a! Labor Relations Board, pushed
the principle of the sitrdown strike
one step nearer legality this
week when in a hearing before
the senate he expressed his lap-
proval of such tactics in cases
where employers failed to abide
by the Wagner act.

Thc statement came as hind-
den defended what he called "civ<
il trespass" against charges by
Senator Burke, cf Nebraska, that
the board encouraged the wave of
sit-downs in the winter and spring
of 1937. ‘
