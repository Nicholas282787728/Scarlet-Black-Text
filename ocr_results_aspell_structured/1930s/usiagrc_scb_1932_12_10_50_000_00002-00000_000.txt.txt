WHISPERS

Grinnell college is particularly
proud of its lecture and colleert
programs that bring to Grinuell
for the benefit of the college stile
dents the best ill musicians and
thinkers at the present time.

The college students must know
and appreciate this fact. there—
fore, it would seem fitting that
they Show their gratitude by pay»
iiig Strict attention to the mater-
ial presented for their benefit.

It has beell noticed that at
every chapel alld Sunday vespcl‘
service, the enjoyment of a great
part of the audience is marred by
the constant hllill of conversation
carried on by a few.

It is probable that these llleln-
bels 0f the audience do not under-
stand the work and c lellse tllat
is undergone to make possible
these prograills. it is probable
that in the time spent ill expl-
ing their own opinions the ink
pom-s miss something that is of
greater \lulu -

We would suggest that before
launching a discussion of their
own. people desiring to t- ilverse
would consider the many factors
im'olved.

THE CLOWN GETS SLAPPED
(Creightouian)

George Bernard Shaw, the famous,
or, if you prefer, the notorious Brit-
ish author and playwright, recently
received a hard Well-aimed smack at
his most sensitixe spotihis conceit.

The anecdote concerns an English
country parson who had written G.
B. S. asking the recipe for a ”perfect
cup of coffee' which this amazingly
clever publicity agent had announced
to the press he possessed. Shaw ans-
wered the request but said in his
letter that he hoped it was genuine
and not another means of getting
his autograph.

To what must have been Shaw’s
great surprise the pal‘son replied: “i
am returning something which is of
no value to me and something which
you apparently greatly prize—your
autograph."

Such a comeback as this probably
will not cause G. B. S. to suffer long,
He prefers to make other people suf-
fer. His verbal swords cut sharply,
cleverly, but rather harmlessly for
they for the most part, out satirical
wounds on subjects that do not anSA
wer back no matter how much salt
is rubbed into the cuts by St. George.

Shaw was never considered a pow-
erful writer. He is merely clover and
since clever men are rather a drug
on the market of present day litera-
ture G. B, s, has kept going by his
scheme to publicize himself on the
grand scale.

or, but a Clown. But people like to
read about clowns as well as they
do about great men. Sometimes they
like to see the clown get smackd.

UNJUS'I‘ USE OF POWER
(Oberlin Ravicw)

One unquestioned proof in psy-
chology is that human beings, espec»
ially when they are young, may cas-
ily be molded into very nearly any
kind of character. The purpose of a
college education, then, is to shape
Semirpliable minds into the best form
possible by means of association with
the finest that has been said and done
in the ,world. Teachers in. colleges, by
the influence they have because of
age and experience, possess to a great
extent the power to mold thoughtful
and discriminating men and women
out of their students.

Every college in the country, Oherr
lin not being excluded, is certain to
have some professors who take ad-
vnrilage of their position in order to
influence students under them to ac-
cept their pet theories as pure truth.
By constant repetition of their argu~
ments and by scorn for any cogent
refutation, these moulders of thought
at length succeed in forcing younger-
men and women to accept the same
attitude as their own.

This is not education in the true
sense; it is not what anyone seeks
in a college of arts and sciencesi
it is rather the cause of the disgust
with which many non-college people
regard those graduated from the
higher institutes of learning.

As students we expcct our classes
to be devoted to a fair consideration
of both sides of every question
brought up, even though we do wish
to clearly understand the profes’SOl's'
our expec‘ations are ignored, ate
narrow molds, and the fundamental
purpose of our college education is
lost.

G

NOT ”CULTURE MANIA"
(Corucnian)

In this highly materialistic age,
nothing is more misunderstood and
criticized than a liberal and classical
education.

It has been generally conceded that
an education is good which can he
used as a basis to maintain or build
one's social and economic position.
Consequently, courses have been ar»
ranged with that end in view, but at
the expense of the classical students.
While model-n practice demands that
Such be the case, it is a fallacy when
the latter are suppressed. it has di-
rect consequences on the success of a
democracy.

What is good for the individual is
not always good for the state. Mods
ern education has increased our ma-
terial standards tremendously, it has
made us healthier, it has made us
more comfortable, but still, democ-
racy has not become more efficient
and just. The mamtairidncc of tie o~
erotic ideals demands a. certain libe -
al-mindedness on the part of all the
people.

To function justly, a. popular gov-
ernment must have individuals who
have a broad understanding and
knowledge of the problems of their
fellows. Modern education has tend-
ed to specialize the minds of citizens,
and, consequently, individuals become
proficient in their own fields. but at
the same time become quite incapable
of giving more than a. kind gesture to
the problems of others and govern»
merit.

Classical education, by bringing
one into contact with a diversity of
problems at an early age, tends to den
velop a type of open mind which
is essential to the smooth functioning
of democracy. A classical education is
not a method of producing “culture
mania" or intellectual snobs, it is a
proven way of learning to live happily
and successfully, A general liberal
education policy is the most practical
and necessary investment that de—
mocrftcy can make.

Liberalizing education is the only
assurance it has of becoming more
than a discreditable political ideal.

SYNTHETIC PERSONALITY
- (Daily Trojan)

Personality, or the effort to achieve
it, is one of the most astonishing fet-
ishes of this astounding age, and the
business of developing personality has
become one of America's curious in—
dustries which follows the factory
method of production.

Why, nowadays, with only ten les-
sons (:1. dollar down and a dollar a
month), one may emerge from tthe
chrysalis that has kept him a wallr

of these rites since their first use;
their»first wide use was during the
fifteenth century when people wanted
to break away from the more formal
religious music,

They were frowned on during the
Puritan rule in England but were re-
vived during the Restoration. Many
carols have come down through seven

Friday

Herschel M. Colbert, assistant pro-
fessor of journalism and director of
public relations, spoke in chapel Frir
day.

He said, ”We at Grinnell like to
toy with the idea that we are more
morally pure than most other col-
Iegcs.”

Mr. Colbert then gave some in-
stances of backsliding—such as de-
struction of college property, “slap-
stick friendliness, noisy library, un-
tidy rooms and dorms, and poor pos-
ture. “These illustrations do not dis-
prove the first statement," he de~
clared, “they show a tendency due
to self-satisfaction and demonstrate
a need of discipline and improve—
ment.”

Dear Sir:
AS one who has been intimate with
telephone operations for several
years, it Seems to me that the service
rendered by the college central leaves
much to be dit'slred.
Of course the exchange has to be
operated by students who could not
be expected to attain the degree of
proficiency required by an independ-
ent exchange but they might at least
monitor calls. It not infrequently
happens that if the number called
does not answer at once, the second
time you ask for it you get a busy
line report. Long waits for the apex»
ator to answer a signal are not Ell: all
uncommon, and cut offs are quite the
order of the day.
Not all the student operators of»
fem] In this manner, but those who
do should have eithnr more education
or supervision.

Yours truly,
