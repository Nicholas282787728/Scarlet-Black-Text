International Relations Club Now Formulating Program
For Ninth Annual Conference to Be Held October 27 to 28

 

By Ice McIntosh
(Pveiidenl a! the Grin/mil lvlluvmlimml
Rclalioni Club)

The Grinnell International Rela—
tions club is rapidly completing
plans for its ninth annual confer»
ence to be held on the campus
October 27 and 23.

With the European war gather—
ing momentum daily and the
growing determination in Amer—
ica to stay out of war and be
prepared to make a peace which
will not repeat the mistakes of
Versailles, the committee is mak-
ing a concentrated effort to have
a conference which will give Grin-
nell students and student dele-
gates from high schools and col—

 

leges in Iowa and the surround-‘

ing states a chance to hear men
who,are more able than they to
draw valid conclusions from the
growing pile of propaganda and
censored news. ,

Never before in the nine yearl
history of the club has the reali-
zation of its obligation to the'
campus been so acute. The club
members, consequently, have
shown a willingness to devote
their time and imagination to-
ward making the conference the
significant meeting they intend it
to be.

In addition to this direct cone
forence work, the old members
have been striving hard during
the past week to recruit new
members from among the largel

class of freshmen, the new trans
fer students, and from among
the Glinnell upperclassmen who
realize the important part the U.
s. will have to play in Winning
the peace.

Some of the conference speak—
ers havc already definitely been
scheduled. They are Joseph Lash,
Kirby Page, and J. Martin Klots-
che,

Lash is the executiversecretary
of the American student Union,
and has been one of the foremost
leaders in the youth movement in
the United states.

For the past four years he has
taken an active part in the
