Pioneers to Meet
Cohawks Tonight

(Continued From Page 1).

According to Coach Truesdalc, Grin.
ncll‘s team play was much improved
over that displayed in the opening
game. Play was close throughout the
contest. At one time in the scconr:
half bnlli tcarns went scoreless seven
minutes, with no break in the play ex.
cept for outaofebounds.

The Grinnell attack was handicapped
in the waning minutes of the tilt by
the absence of both Mason and Bauer-
[rain the lineup. Mason was bothered
by the recurrence of an old ankle in.
jury which forced him to the side.lines,
The injury is not expected to keep
him out of tonight's game. however,
Coach 'l‘ruesdalc said this morning.

Mental Lapses Costly

All of the Grinnell rnen suffered from
costly mental lapses occasionally,
Truesdalo asserted. A number oi
Ames baskets were gained by quick
drives through the Grinnell defense
which could have been stopped had
the Pioneer played heads_up ball con»
sistently.

Bauer showed up especially well
while he stayed in the game, accord.
ing'to the cage coach, and bath Brad.
ley and McMul-ray, among the re.
serves, showed considerable promise.

on Other Hills [

No one will ever be able to say that
a certain South Dakota professor isn't
practical and able to deal with the
realities of life. He was out hrking
with a gun one day. Ambling about,
he couldn’t resist a shot at a pheasant,
although it was out of season. To
his consternation, he killed the bird,
At that moment. he observed out oi
the corner of his eye, a car stopping
on the road, so he stuffed the pheas.
ant into a corn shock. Sure enough,
the visitor was the game warden. As
he drew nearer, the professor picked
up the entire corn shock and began to
walk away.

“Hey, what’s the idea?”
called.

“Oh, just getting some Thanksgiving
decorations," answered the protessor-
in a cheer-y voice~and got away with
itl .

. s a ,

the man

To the business men who regard all
professors as “visionaries" the state.
meme of a prominent magazine writer
won’t be welcome. ”The professors
are in Washington to stayifor a good
many years, airway," he writes. How.
ever, he adds, people should lose the
notion they are dictating policies.
Policies arise because of effective pro.
fessorial ideas, he concludes.

Chances are that writer never had
to argue over an exam mark with a
professor.

157a shrewd and amusing study of
the artistic temperament as displayed
in the mediocre artist

skillfully Directed

Having been thus uncharitable, one
who saw Friday night's performance
would have in iustice to add that the
play was well mounted, skilfully doi—
l'ected. and capably acted.

lVL'lss Searle, Mr. Smith, and Miss
Harper were never dull, and the last
must be particularly commended for
making the most of a comparatively
small part.

James Patterson, except for a rather-
gratuitous likeness to Charles Laugh-
ton, which could surely have been
avoided, did well, although neither he
nor Mr. Kirk has yet learned to laugh
convincingly.

Gentleman Pug

William Callaway's prize- ghtcr- was
gentlemanly and plausible; Francelia
Smith successfully resisted what may
well have been a temptation to act the
conventional comic maid.

Miss Chisholm, in spite of the resar.
vations already notcd, played enthus—
iastically a part which only unenlhus.
iasticai playing could really spoil; and
Miss Phelps, one was convinced, hail
the correct conception of the charact.
or she was playing

Finally, the reviewer must record
his and others' gratitude to the depart—
ment of drama, which makes possible
in these times of canned entertainment
the seemg of real flesh and hlood
people acting in plays of contempor.
ary interest.
