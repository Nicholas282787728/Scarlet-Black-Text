TOO MUCH CAIVJJ’AIGN'ING

Offryear elections, and the
September election in Maine
have for years been used as a
measure of public opinion con-
cerning the next presidential
election, Voting last week
proved to be no exception, al-
though both sides were able to
claim that the results were in
their favor.

. New York elected a Republi-
can legislature to displace the
first Democratic majority in the
legislature in years, While the
Republicans are hailing this as
a swing in their favor, the Dem-
ocrats are pooh-poohing it be-
cauce of the fact that the New
York legislature is so habitually
Republican, 0n the Democratic
side of the ledger is a decided
victory for the New Deal gub-
ernatorial candidate in Ken~

tucky.

These elections probably re-
veal little as to the trend of
opinion as regards the Presiden»
tial campaign, but they do quite
definitely show the great length
of time over which our cam-
paigns are drawn out. Already,
a year before the next election,
campaign talk and propaganda
are becoming prevalent. In
June the conventions will meet
to nominate candidates, and
then the electioneering will get

'under way in full swing with
Vast sums of money being spent
by both of the major parties.

In contrast to this is the elec-
tion system in England ,which
lasts but three weeks. This is
far less expensive, and greatly
lessens the period of time in
which the country must strug-
gle under an emotional strain
caused by the Campaign

We realize fully that it is not
logical to compare closely the
election activities of the two
countries because of the vastly
different types of government
and the difference in size of
countries, Could not the United
States learn something from
England along these lines, how-
ever?

We have no definite plan to
offer as a remedy but we do
feel that this problem is some
thing to think about. Doubt
less, there is some way of short-
ening our needlessly long cam-
paigns. Perhaps the solution
lies in the increasing use of
radio in electioneering — pelt
haps not, H. H.

Agricultural Situation
Analyzed by Wheeler

“American agriculture cannot be
really prosperous without a sub-
lstantial export trade,” L. A Wheel»
cr, member of the foreign division
of the bureau of economics in the
department of agriculture, stated
yesterday morning in his addl ss
on the “Position of Agriculture in
the Foreign Trade cf the United
States."

He also does not believe that it
is reasonable to expect agriculture
Ito again assume the importance in
American foreign trade that it did
in earlier days,

Three Solutions

In discussing the solutions to the
difficulties in which American age
l'iculture is in regard to foreign
trade. he explained that there are
three solutions which this country
might adopt.

First, America may become lu-
tensely internationally~minded and
throw down its tariffs and thus
seek to regain the fcrcign trade,
Second, America may become in-
tensely nationalistic and attempt
to become absolutely selfsuffb
cient, and thirdly. it may adopt a
middle course, which lies some-
where between the first two alter-
natives,

Believes in Middle Course

“Personally, I lean strongly to
ward a middle course. which would
necessitate a considerable read-
justment of our agricultural plant,
but which would not be as drastic
as either of the other two alterna-
tives. Such readjustment would
assure substantial exports of those:
products which the United stapes
is pnniculai-ly well equipped to
pladuce,"

In reviewing the present condi-
llou of international trade. I/u,
Wheeler poin .d out that the “to-
tal volume of international trade
fell during the depression to a low
in 1932 of 75% of the volume of
1929 and since then has made very
little recovery."

The present trend in agricultural
export trade seems to indicate that
it will be smaller in the future than
it was in the 1920's andrthat there
will be an increased pressure upun‘
domestic markets.

Tsurumi Explains
Japan’s Foreign Policy

"There is no real clash of inter
cats, either economic or cultural,
between the United States and
Japan,” declared Dr, Yllsulic
Tsurumi of Tokio, Japan, in his
address yesterday afternoon on the
topic “The Recent Foreign Policies
of Japan."

“Today the problem of the Pa.-
cific involves the realization of the
coming together of the cultures of
the East and West in the Pacific.
Whether or not this meeting rs
sulta in a world catastrophe or not
remains to be seen," he declared.
That the clash will come is inevi-
table.

Chum a Question

In discussmg the general prob-
lems of the Pacific, Dr. Tsurllllli
explaincd that all of the problems
simmer down to one question-l7
china, Her population of 450 mil»
llon people ccnatltutcs‘a vast [10*
tential and as yet untapped mar-
ket which every nation is seeking
to secure. This general effort at
exploitation has resulted in seri-
ous economic competition between
the different natlons of the world,

 

Japan's chief problem today is
an overabundant and rapidly in—
crcaaing population which has ex-
crtcd a tremendous force upon the
Japanese foreign policy. Although
the birth rate is declining it will
not bcccme stabilized until amund
1955 and until that time the popu-
lation problem will become more
and more acute.
annn Expands.

In explaining the Japanese ter '-
torial expansion on the Asiatic cone
tlnent, Dr. Tauruml pointed out
that Korea and South Manchuria
have a geographic and military po-
sltion in relation to Japan that Bel.
gium and the Netherlands have to
Great Britain. For those lands to
fall into the hands of a hostile na-
[ion would be disastrous for Japan
and in self.defense shc seized them

"There is no danger of Fascism
developing in Japan," Mr. Tsurumi
asserted. "At the last election the
extreme nationalist party was de-
feated and there is no danger of
the adherents of this party at—
tempting to set up a dictatorship."

, Bryant Lists Needs

for National Security
“Leadership, statesmallshlp and
friendship are the three ships nccd
ed to obtain national security," de-
clal'ed Stewart L, Bryant, retired
United States naval officer, in his
address last evening on the sub-
ject, “What is National Security?”
With sufficient international ore
gunization, the United States can
solve the problems which threaten
world peace between countries,
Bryant said. Insularity and self-
sufflciency are advantages that
America holds over European na-
tions, and this should help us in
case of War.

“In case of European wars,
should the United States place an
embargo upon warring nations?”
asked the lieutenant commander in
a series of questions. “This would
bring peace, but it would also cause
poverty with the doubling or trip»
Mfg of our unemployment through
the cutting off of world exports,"
he answered.

If we do become entangled in a
war, it will be the laborers and
makers of supplies who mainly
will swing the outcome. rather
than the fighters on the battlefield,
Bryant believes The acceleration
of mechanical, industrial and air

powers during recent ycars places
an increasing importance upcu
warfare supplies.

Radio, cinema and the press can
lbe used to help us obtain national
security through thcprescntatlcn
Iof actual facts, education of the
pccplc and repression of propagan»
do, the speaker said in discussing
lthc educational need of the coun-
try.

LaiJler Criticises
Fascist State

The economics of fascism and
nazism is one of “regulated cap-
italism under a political dictator, of
an economics of scarcity, not abun-
dance, of nationalism instead of in-
tcmationaliam," as opposed to the
socialist theory of "private monop-
oly in a system of social owner-
Ship," stated Harry w, Laldlcr in
his talk on “Fascist Versus Social-
ist Economics," last night,

In speaking of Italy, Mr. Laidler
said that Mussolini: totalitarian
state is a failure, having constantr
‘ly lost ground in the past 12 years
by failing to gain anything in art
and culture, or industry and soda
ty It's population is poorer and
less effectively educated. and in
realizing this Mussolini has divert»
ed attention from the economic
question to a so-cslled “glorious
warfare.” "The collapse of Italy
under the present regime is only a
question of time," he asserted.

Socialism, on the other hand,
means public ownership of the
great industries and machines of
production with financial compen-
sation to everybody proportionate
to the individual's ability. Further
more. "one of the great causes of
political corruption could be done
away with in a socialist system,"
continued the Speaker.

‘U. S. FareignRolicy
Astute’—Boalh

“The United States has a large
moral responsibility in the pres-
ent world crisis. precipitated by
the Italo-Ethicpian conflict, and is
proving itaelf vely astute in fill-
ing that responsibility," declared c.
Douglass Booth in speaking on
“Conflicts in the Mediterranean,"
this morning,

The speaker pointed out that
there were three ways of dcaling
with the African conflict, first by

peaceful sanctions, and last by
paceful sanctions, and last by
some nthcr method which will nne
ucublcdly involve tile use of lhe
Br‘l:sh fleet.

This, he stated uoud cliango‘
thc complex of t. situation from
a small conflict to a lcrge and se-
rious one. If this happens the
United States would undoubzcdly
be drawn into conflict with Britain
over what constituted contraband,
This very thlng occurred during
the last War

After outlining the interests and
aims of the various countries in
the Mediterranean, Mr. Booth told
of the means by which the inter..
national community can secure
permanent peace. “It will have to
secure peace and secure justice for
Italy and Germany, two of the dye
namic, expanding nations. It will
be necessary for Britain and
France to sacrifice something of
their own, and not in this case
something they don’t want.

“With the pl-cscnt archaic ideas
on nationality, a settlement is ex-
tremely difficult. However, we
must have a universally recognized
international community, if we arc
ever to have a permanent peace.
Here the United States has a very
definite responsibility,” the apenkr
er added.
