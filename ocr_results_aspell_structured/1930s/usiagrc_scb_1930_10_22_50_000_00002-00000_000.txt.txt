OCCUPYING FRONT SEATS

The Grilinell daily chapcl is a service for both
students and faculty. and its purpose is to unite
them ill closer bonds of acqllﬂll‘llltlnﬂcsllip and
understanding: This purpose cannot be realized
unless the speaker feels a personal contact witll his
audience.

The age old tradition that front seats should
be occupied by seniors has been abandoned, and
all students from freshmen to seniors will do the
speaker a courtesy by occupying front seats. A
speaker cannot talk well to a group of people in
the back of the room, over rows of empty scats.
and neither will the back scat listcllcr glam: all
that he should from the Speaker.

Under classmcn need have no fear of on
ing upon the rights of upper classlneu to front
seats. If the ﬁrst people there will sit in froli
the others ﬁll in behind, Grilinell chapel s
will assume a more friendly and cooper
mosphcre. and the student body and faculty will
understand each other better.

A TRIO 0F HONEECOMINGS

Despite Griunell’s loss of three football games
this year, the Pioneers seem to be a popular team
at: most schools. Grinncll schedules always demon»
Stratcd that, however, even when the showing of the
team is not the best.

Last week the Grinncll clcycn drew the larg—
est‘ m‘ou'tl el'cr in the Drillio stadium. playing at
the Drake Homecoming. This week tho team is
meeting Carleton at the Homecoming game for the
Minnesota school, and llcxt week will tackle Creiglr
ton at the Grinucll T'Inlllccolning. Colleges custom-
arily schedule a popular team for their Homecomr
ing, and Grinucll’s demand makes the worth of
the team self evident.

The fans like to See the Pioneers on the grid-
iron. Ncarly always doped to lose, more often out-
weighed than not, the Scarlet and black tuam puts
up a battle to the last minute and is seldom dcr
cisivcly beaten. The attending throngs at Milwane
kce. Detroit. and Drake are indicative of the fcclr
ing of the falls toward this brand of play.

In 1027, the year in which Grinncll foiled 1.0
win a single game, the Pioneers had been invited
to play Brown university at Providence, R. I. The
eastern coast has faith in the Grinuell team. The
least that the Student body can do is to offer like
support.

The schedule for 1931 will be started before
many Weeks. The teams included may not be as
strong as some of those featured this season, but
Griuncll is a small college and cannot be continuale
ly in the limelight. The games scheduled on Ward
ﬁeld may be comparatively minor compared to
others on the schedule. But Ward ﬁeld cannot
draw a crowd of 15,000 persons.

After all, the students may bask in the light
reﬂected to them as the team wins favor on forcign
gridirons, and that provides some consolation for
games which are not seen.

A LIMIT T0 JOKING

Three practical jokers attempted to Score 1).

ing at the front door of the home wearing shoots.
Today the leader of the trio has his head wrappod
in bandages, the result of blows inﬂicted by it base-

Similar incidents were common in the ycars
following the Civil war. Race hatred was the rea-
son then, while the affair Sunday Seemingly was
performed in jest and all good faith. Realization of
the duty to protect his family, and the torment of
like disturbances earlier in the evening, spurred
the Negro to stop the foolishness by force.

Legal intervention in the trouble was not
necessary. The joker received his punishment, :lnd
the family should feel certain that no further disr
turbanccs will be made.

THE COMNHTTEE 0N ADMISSIONS

After disheartening athletic defeats it is Come
fol-ting to realize that a Small college’s claim to
immortality must rest. on it l) . . far more profound
and for less ephemeral than football. This fact
should not be forgotten because there are always
sport l'aus declaring that the institution will go to
the dogs if someone doesn’t bog or bribe some more
high power athletes into the college halls.

By the nature or things, Gl-iiluell cannot be
a nationally famous grid 'on machine. It is not
situated in a city, nor will it ever have the count
loss hordes of alumni that universities can claim.
It is the crowds of tens of thousands of pnoplc
that bring all-American grid lulitc'hl to colleges.
The worship of the pigskin doesn’t ﬁt in with Grin-
llcll tradition anyway.

This does not doom Grinucll to unknown ﬂied:
iccritl. Many small colleges are nationally known.
They are known for scholastic standing. They are
known for having more intelligent, more carefully
selected students than do the towering universities
which overshadow their tiny campuses.

Grinncll has a reputation in tho litiddlcwcst
for the quality of its students. The committee on
admissions has followed a standard of obtaining
better and better students. Athletes arc cucoure
aged to come, but they are not admitted when they
will clearly be ineligible for competition during a
good deal of their stay.

Thanks to this policy, Grillncll‘s pr tigc coll-
tiuuos to rise ycnr by year. The committee on lid-
luissions deserves collilucudatiml and support.

DRAKE AND GRINNELL FRIENDSHIP
. (From the Grinneu—urake Football rmgram)

Drake university is again happy to welcome the
Grinnell football squad and student body to her campus
for the annual gridiron game, which brings Drake’s
Homecoming to a most ﬁtting climax Friday night, Oct.
17.

The Pioneer and Bulldog elevens will be playing
their thirty-seventh contest. During the 34 years that
the two schools have been competing on the football
ﬁeld, a. friendly spirit of rivalry has always existed.
Tonight the schools again renew this happy relationship.

Drake feels itself fortunate that it. can have a part
in this delightful friendship, and is delighted to have
such a worthy opponent for its Homecoming game.

The two football teams will he ﬁghting to the limit
for possession of the old oaken bucket. Grinnell snp~
porters will cheer for the Pioneers; Drake enthusiasts
will encourage the Bulldogs. One of the teams will win,
but Drake and Grinnell friendship will continue, the
happy relationship 'all the stronger because of another
exhibition of sportsmanship,

VERGIL'S GIFT
(From the Daily Inwim)

“Arms and the man I sing, who at the ﬁrst from
Troy’s shares, the exile of destiny, won his way to Italy
and her Latin coast . .

That a singer born in 70 B. 0. should be as yet
unsurpassed in purity of language and nobility of theme,
might well be an inspiration for the poets of today.
Butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers have gone
into oblivion, but the poetry of a roan who dreamed and
called upon muses to inspire him, is being read today
as it has never been read through the centuries, retain-
ing its vigor and wholesome freshness.

1n aJ'Work b. day” world, it is hard for the mechan—
ical minded man to understand the poetic soul. Such a
one is too often shamed by associates into accepting
the common occupations of his fellows. So many can
do the ordinary; so few are gifted with a golden voice.
It is those few who inspire the magic coloring needed
for our soul's good, that make the silver lining in dull
days. It is they who diversify labor by dreams, who ex~
press mankind’s innermost thought and ideals in
a way that gives a momentary glimpse of real selves
under the mercenary exterior.

Vergil sings of ideals; of horror and glory that
comes to him who is true to his ideals. He sings of the
progress, of the soil, of gods, heroes, and common folk.
But above all he sings. And it is his clear, sincere voice,
coming down through the ages that can inspire modern
man to soar above his surroundings.
