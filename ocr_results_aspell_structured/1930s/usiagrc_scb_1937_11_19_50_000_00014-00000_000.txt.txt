Pho+os Illustrate
English Principles
For Freshmen

Morgantown, W. V3.7(ACP77
A new way to illustrate the struc-
tural principles of writing has
been put into use at the Univerr
sity of West Virginia. Composi-

ltion is mixed with photography.

The freshmen taking courses in
composition hunt for pictures that
prove some of the time points of
composition. The person who can

get the proper perspective with
a camera turns out to be the one
who tinds it easier to get the core
rect slant on his stories.

For example, one student found
that a scene at a high mountain
peak in the distance could be
marred by ‘a disfiguring wire
fence in the foreground, indicat-
ing that nonessential details can
rum any manuscript.

The students bring their illus-
trative snapshots to school and
find that the grades on their
themes go up as they apply the
nice points of photography to Eng-
lish composition.
