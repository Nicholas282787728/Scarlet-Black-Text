With the Pioneer football season
exactly one quarter gone and with
a hreatning spell now in progress,
it might he n-e‘ll to review the
past and see what the riituie has
to after, The most obvious fact
is that Grinnell has a good fools
hall team on the field. Last Sat-
urday the Pioneers lost to a good
team that they might have heateu
if their passing attack had lieen
clicking. It was no disgrace to
lose, especially when they went
down fighting hard.

Some inns have commented that
they thought the team lost be~
cause there was a general lct-
down in blocking, tackling and
the team spirit. it must be re»
ineiiihered that a team never
looks as good in defeatv as it does
in victory. Even as the Pioneers
lost to State Teachers, one of the
officials of the game, who has 9t-
fieiatcd Grllmell games for many
years. remarked that “the Fion-
eers displayed the best spirit of
any of their teams in the last ten
years."

In the Cornell game. they proved
to their coach and to their fol-
lowers that they had what it

takes to make a good team. They
lost Saturday, but in doing so
they proved they could still keep
moving upward In the futurei
with six games left to be played,
they can prove to evcl'yolle’s sat-
lsfaction that Grinncll football
teams have developed a winning

complex.

When the scores were all in alter
lest Setniday's grid contests, we
felt like our host liicnd, the dope
hook, had deserted us tor good. No
wonder, with such “sure things"
as stanrord, Drake, and the Pioir
c all taking it on the chin,
with the pledge of seci-ccy given,
we have turned this week's prog-
nosticatzons over to two of the
most rabid football fans on the
campus. Hiding behind the see
curity of their aiioinnity, they
ventured to predict the lollowing:
Iowa 7, Wisconsin 6.
Tulsa 13, Washington U. 7.
Kansas 26, Washhurn 1.
Nebraska 14, Iowa State 0.
Oklahoma A&M 12, Creighton 7.

Before this year, the first for-

eign language studied in the
grades was German, This year,
schools ale starting students on
the English language,

“This is indicative of the gen-
eral trend of feeling in Sweden,"
said Young. “There was a great
deal of pt‘usGei'man feeling dun
ing the World War. New Sweden
is siding ivitli the English, and
Swedish exports are more and
(more going to England.”

“I do not think Sweden wants
to go to war, and in case of war,
shc will probably iemoin neutral
unless invaded.

“There is talk of a general
Scandinavian military alliance,
but it would probably not hold in
case or attack," Young said,

Young studied Swedish at the
University of Chicago to facili»
tate as study of Sweden's mone-
tary policy,

It was through this study that
he heard of the fellowship ex—
changes which inade it possible
for him to study in Sweden.

and the University of Colorado,
