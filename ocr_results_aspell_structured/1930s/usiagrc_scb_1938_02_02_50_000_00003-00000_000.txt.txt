TO THEM All

But Brunch Bobbi",
like so many other

independent experts,
prefers luckies...

“ T AUCTIONS in my warehouse

says Mri Branch Bobbitt, "Lucky
Strike buyers know what robacco
they want and they'll keep bidding
right up until they get it.

“Welliin a cigarette—it's the
tobacco that counts. I know tobacco
and I know what tobacco is in
wlmt cigarettes. 50 th ’5 one reason
I've smoked Luckicsﬁot over ﬁve
years now.”

Many other experts agree with
Mr. Bobbitt. Sworn records show
that, among independent tobacco
experts, Luckies have twice as many
exclusive smokexs as have all the
other cigarettes combined.
