“I Will Not Write of Hitler,
Men,” Ludwig

I Write of Great

By Margaret Moylc

“I write biographies of only‘
great menil will not write of}
Hitler," Emil Ludivig announced}
Tucsday evening when asked it he‘

. had considered writing a biograe

plly of the German dictator. Lud-
wig spoke in the Culigl'eg‘a‘iional‘
church Tuesday evening on “Mod-J
crn Makers of History.” ;

At the suggestion that he write:
a history of the League of .Niz-l
tions, Ludwig seemed amazed.
“But there is nothing to write!"
he exclaimed. Immediately after
the war it might have been done,‘
he continued. but now it is too!
late. Ludwig then explained that
the League, in his estimation,
never reached its peak, and has
been steadily descending in powerl
since 1926,

The next war is “imminent" he.
is positive, but he refused to ven—
ture an opinion as to how it will
start. He is certain, however,

lthat it Will end in a class strug-'

gle as in every European country
there arc many common people
who wul refuse to fight. Although
in his lecture Ludwig had spoken
of the German laboring class as
“obedient" and “Warriors,“ he be-
licvcs that many of Lhem will re-
fuse to take part in war.
