Steiner Delivers

Talk at Special
Chapel Tuesday

The necessity for catching the rhy.
thm of work was stressed yesterday
morning by Dr. Edward A. Steincr, in
his address before the all.college con.
vocation in Herrick chapel which at.
ticially reopened school for the second
semester.

illustrating the average undergrad.
uate’s need for capturing this "Thy.
thm", he pointed out lrow the inhabit.
ants of the Hebrides islands in the
North Sea had found happiness in
the rhythm of their work. Although
living a life which is a constant battle
against the fierce elements, they still
live a joyous life, he explained.

“You young folks are clean and fine,
but you have not caught the rhythm
of work. You have not yet learned
the value of discipline and self denial
which are essential to success,” de.
clared Dr. Steiner,

Recalling a personal experience of
a low years ago, the speaker pointed
out that in climbing a mountain one
must have the rhythm of slow walking,
discipline in drinking ice—water, and
self.deniai in eating “Only he that
cverccmeth shall receive the crown
of life in reaching some mountain top,"
Dr. Steiner concludcd.
