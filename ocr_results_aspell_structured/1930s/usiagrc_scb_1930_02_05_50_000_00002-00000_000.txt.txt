NOW BEAT CREIGHTON!

Upon the American college the powerful and pens»
trating intellects of the critics of our American civiliza-
tion has been turned with avidity during the past de-
cade. Especially has been criticized the immature and
youthful rah—rah sp it of the colle‘gian. Now we dis»
like being called immature and superficial, but we
confess, nevertheless, that we emitted fifteen tremen-
dous cheers when it was announced last Monday eve-
ning that the Drake Bulldog had been forced to bite the
dust, for the years spent in college at Grinnell become
eminently successful if during that time our ancient
rivals are compelled to admit Pioneer superiority a
number of times.

The Whale school joins in paying tribute to the cour—
ageous basketball team which fought Drake to :1 stands
still Monday evening and which would not admit defeat
even with less than twenty seconds to play. The game
itself was but another example of what Grinnellians
are permitted to witness every year at least three or
four times: the Grinnell spirit in action. Whu can de-
fine the Grinhell spirit? It may mean many things to
many people. One thing it does mean to all people,
and thut is the upholding Cf Grinnell standards, whether
standards of ideals, of mental achievement or physical
prowess. The basketball team exemplified that spirit
the other night by uphold‘ng gloriously‘ this common
element in the Crinnell spirit, and credit to them!

Interest is now focused on the approaching Creigh-
ton game Friday night. The Omaha team has already
administered the worst defeat of the season to the Pio-
neers. But the team will go into Friday's game with a
World of confidence in its own power, and the backing
of the entire student body, which joins in expressing
the belief that as Marquette fell in the final minutes of

play on the gridiron last fall, as Drake felt the force of
a last quarter Pioneer drive in the football game played
last October, as the Bulldogs fell Monday night, so
Creighton can be beaten if the Pioneers carry that same
Crinncll spirit into their battle with the crack cage
squad that comes here Friday evening.

REGISTRATION.

Registration is one of the disagreeable hits of col-
lege routine which come under the classihcation of
necessary evils. Any modification in the registration
system which would eliminate some of the time or labor
now devoted to this process and at the same time cover
all the necessary details connected with enrollment for
courses, would probably meet with general approval.

At present Grinnell has what might be called a
triple registration system. Advanced students enroll
for the following year‘s classes in the spring of the pre-
ceding year, then in the fall. At the end of the ﬁrst
semester they ﬁll out cards announcing their intentions
for the second semester.

The latter two steps while valuable in checking
up on the student, and in allowing him to announce
changes in his courses are in many cases superﬂuous.
If they could be eliminated without seriously interfering
with any other function which registration serves such
a step might seem desirable. If all students intending
to follow their course as outlined in their spring res
gistration, were allowed simply to drop a card notifying
their major professor of this fact, this would eliminate
a personal conference. Personal conferences could then
be reserved only for those students who contemplated
changes. At the end of the ﬁrst semester, students
enrolled for full year courses, who did not expect to
change, could inform their major professors in similar
manner.

Thus by limiting the professors interviews to those
intending changes, and in allowing those students not
contemplating re'v ions to attend to their registration
quickly and efficiently, such a modiﬁcation in the re-
gistration system would be helping both faculty and

undergraduates.
A. de P,

NEXT WEEK’S DIET.

it does not take the average freshman many weeks
at Grinnell to observe that the majority of upper class-
men do not attend chapel regularly, whatever the rea-
sons may be. A few independent first year men and
women may persist in attendance for a few weeks, but
by this time in the year, most of them have adopted
the path of least resistance, which means that they
rarely darken the chapel door.

Because this is true, we wish to point out to the
freshman Class, as well as to upperclassmen, some rear
ons why they should enter the portals of Herrick chapel
when the Gates lectures are given next week by Dr,
Raymond C. Brooks of Pomona college, It is admitted
that doughnuts and coffee are never more appealing
than at a quarter of ten, the hour of Dr. Brouks’ lece
tures, but on the other hand - , .

The Gates lectures have always been presented by

'men really outstanding in religious circles, and their

messages have been sufficiently thought-provoking to
even cause ”sessions” on their content at the dormitor-
ics later in the day. In a word, the college student will
be forced to thinlr in all likelihood, should he attend the
Gates lectures, which should recommend them to every-
one.

Moreover, the man who delivers the Gates lectures
speaks from life—long experience in a field too-much
neglected by the average collegian, namely, that of re-
ligion, What truth is, or Where it is to be found, is
difficult to say in these days. At least, Dr. Brooks may
contribute some ideas which will point the way to truth
in religion. If the educated man is one who seeks af—
ter truth, then here is another reason why the Gates
lectures should have the time of students next week.

If the daily coffee and doughnuts just can‘t be
given up, why not attend the lectures and discuss them
over the social table later in the day, as in the English
Coffeehouses of other days? Far be it from us to
choose the students diet, but a diet of Gates lectures
next week certainly deserves everyone-s serious consid-
eration. And if each one seriously considers them, Dr.

Brooks will have the chapel full throughout the week.

Clark Takes Lead

in Dorm Swimming

By qualifying as many men as all
the other halls together, Clerk took
a commanding position in the chrome
ations of the intramural swimming
meet, held Tuesday afternoon. The
finals are to be held Thursday after-
noon beginning at 4 o’clock sharp.
Dan Crates,

the smallest man in Grinnell, was
the most outstanding swimmer of
the day, turning in an 3:33 in the
quarter mile and a 22.3 in the forty
yard free style. Due to the fact that
only five buildings have entered
teams in the relays, no eliminations
were held.

The events were as follows:
