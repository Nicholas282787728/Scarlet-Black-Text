THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Grinnall‘s basketball squad, which
last year boasted inore Slx-foulers
than any other cage outfit in the
Missouri Valley conference, has re-
versed places this year and the aver-
age height of players here is now less

than that of any other circuit team,

way of height.

The decision of the Big Six con
forenec to use only one official in
basketball games is sound from an
economic point of view because a
sizeable sum may be saved during the
season by eliminating the umpire.
The game itself suffers, however,
judging from reports of Big Six
games. The Nebrask Iowa State
games took on the aspects of a foot-
ball melee at times, partly because
one official was unable to see every-

thing on Liproff play .

Rumor has it that Iowa State
Teachers college may not be included
in the proposed new conference of
Iowa colleges since it is a state insti-
tution and nearly all of the suggested
members are privately endowed col-
leges. many having denominational

connections.

Grinnell continues to feature in the
proposed conference gossip although
authorities here 'appflrmltly tul'lll‘d a

One of two games to decide the

Creighton's complete monopoly of
conference honors is shown in the in»
dividual scoring column where Six
Creighton men are among the 10
leaders. Cornie Collin's 12 points
against Grinnell brought his average
in Valley games down to 13 points
per game.

Willard Schmidt, Creighton's six
foot eight inch sophomore center,
climbed into second place as the Jays
took the measure of the Pioneers.
Schmidt towered over the small Grine
nell guards and dropped in seven
field goals from under the basket,
adding one point from the foul line
to lead the scoring for the evening.

star, climbed into fourth place with
