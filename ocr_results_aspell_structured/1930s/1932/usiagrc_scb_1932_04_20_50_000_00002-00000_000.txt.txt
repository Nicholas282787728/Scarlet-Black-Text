POLICY

Today ’s issue marks the first under the new
management. The illcolninri editor and business
manager face a task worthy of their best efforts—
that of setting a standard ant “sticking to it.”

It \n'll he their policy, not to give merely the
“how, “'llel‘l. and where” of campus lie“ but to
furnish its readers with full, unbiased accounts of
current happening.

It is not tllel object to be, unduly ori idol of
student affairs. For too much ”l-azzing” is worse
than none at all. On the other hand, they do not
intend to praise 'here praise is not due, anymore
than they expect it for themselves.

The new lllauagenlont will try at all times to
be non-partisan. and will keep the editorials on
the page set aside for them. Ill the editorials. it
will strive for the things it belim'cs to be right. and
will welcome letters to the editor: whether in
agrcolnelltior not. lt is not 1) lilo to please all.
But, it is their hope that they ii ll be allle to please
allot tho I'Cﬂtlel'57SOIllt} at the time.

CLIQUES

A prominent lilemllcr of the Grillnoll faculty
recently stated that CVO] one. student or not, he-
longs to a r qllc of some . ort.

There a lot of truth ill what he Sal‘s. There
are athletic cliques. social cliques, journalistic
cliqu and numerous others, all helieiliiig theme
solve. all important, and belittling the outsider.
Such cllculnstauces mo to lie deplored.

Real success, espe an ill times like these. can
come only thru pulling tog-etllmillot against
each other. 'Ollst‘l'it' the good points of the fellmi'
who doesn’t “speak your language.” Remember
he ‘ just as intelestcd in the things he does, as
you die in youl acti es.

’l‘llelo are less tliquos lli Giiitllell than in most
schools. Tilelc would lie a lot less.

“I HAVEN T TIME"
(From lilidlnnd College Midland)

”I haven’t time" is often the excuse of students when
refusing to work on a. committee or explaining why their
work in some extra-curricular activity has been neglect»
ed. Often the excuse for ill~prepared lessons is that
work on campus activities did not: leave time for study.
One phase of college life seems Lo crowd the other so
that the student says “I haven’t time,”

This excuse is no longer valid, however, because of
investigations carried on recently. Dr. 0. Myking Mehus
of the social science department, Missouri State Teach-
as college, has made a complete survey of the situation.
His survey shows that students who take part in the
largest number of campus activities tend to receive the
highest grades, while those who participate in no extra»
Curricular activities get the lowest grades. surveys con-
ducted by the Blue Key and Sigma Lambda Chi have
proved the same thing to be true at Midland.

It is an established fact that young people who are
successful in college are usually successful in later life.
Success along one line shows that the student has the
ability to be successful in other phases as well. There-
fore, students who say "I haven't time” either are ad~
mitting that they do not have the ability to take in a
range of occupations or are trying to get out of re-
sponsibility by making excuses, The seeming lack of
time may be caused by daily schedules that are not well
arranged, Whatever the cause, "I haven't time" is no
longer a good excusefor neglected duties .

A WRONG READING
(From The Beloit News)

Altho there are many mysteries, there is none quite
so baffling as a certain collegiate tendencyiwe suspect
it isn't confined to college students, howeveriuldt
especially intrudes itself into the consciousness since it
is somewhat more annoying than a good many others. It
is the impossibility of recognizing a reason for the prefr
ei-ence of a certain type of reading among college youth
7a preference tor opinions that agree thoroughly with
the students' opinions before they pick up the acticle for
reading. And still worse, if they accidentally get hold of
some reading material presenting an opinion adverse to
their own, it is almost immediately characterized as of
no consequence and even wrong.

Why this attitude should exist is, as we have said,
difficult to determine, especially since a perusal of con-
tiovprsialiy contradictory materiel demands a greater ex-
ercise of thought and consequently results in n develop-
ment of the intellect which nothing else quite equals. To
lead material presenting what one already knows and her
lieves, has no commendable merit in it save that of
recognizing a new presentation of the same thought.
It. requires no deep thinking.

Whereas, on the contrary, when adverse opinion is
presentediparticulaﬂy when it is presented with argu-
ments and perhaps even proofs—to maintain the original
opinion demands a recog on and formulation of arc

gnments which will defeat the writer’s contentions. It is‘

the best way to cultivate clear thinking.
