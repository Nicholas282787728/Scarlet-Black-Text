Biography of Seal‘rary
Shows Faith in Youth

Samuel Seabury, arch~fue of Tam-
many hall, in his selection of the 24
lawyers to aid him in the lnvestiga~
tion in New York City recently, ex-
pressed his philosophy of unbounded
faith in the idealism, the industry,
and the courage of youth, according
to Walter chambers new biography,
“Samuel Seabnry—A Challenge,”
published yesterday by The Century
company.

The composite age of the legal
staff selected, the biographer writes,
is well under 30 years. Judge Sea-
bury himself, the new volume says,
hung out his shingle at 21 and at 23
became a judge of the city court,
the youngest judge in the court's
history.

Curiously enough, the book‘ points
out that he was born on Fourteenth
street, only two blocks west of Tam-
many hall, whose Nemesis he was to
become.
