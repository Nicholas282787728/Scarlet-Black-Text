Squad of 70
at Marquette

Football

Best in Years

Spring Turnout

(spinal In Tlic Starlcl alrtl Blast)

MILWAUKEE, WIS ~A squad of
70 incn, one of the largest turnouts in
the history of football at Marquette
nnivcrsity, is rounding out its second
week at spring drill on the Hilltop
and already gives promise of develop
ing into another formidable Golden
Avalanche aggregation.

Spring drill at Marquette is being
handled by Line Coach John L. (Tarw
zan) Taylor, who assumed command

 

in the absence of Head Coach Frank
J. Murray, Because of illness, Murr
ray was confined to his home for six
weeks and then went to the univer-
sity hospital to undergo a successful
mastoid operation from which he is
now recovering.

Pleascd by the gencral physical
condition of the spring squad, Coach
Taylor ordered scrimmage on the
third day of practice and these hcnvy
workouts have been repeated on al-
ternate days since then.

The Marquette squad is divided in-
to two sections. Athletes wearing
gold are those who have won varsity
letters or who were members of the
1931 roster, while the freshmen and
other recruits have been assigned
blue togs. Games will he played be
tween the two groups late in April.
