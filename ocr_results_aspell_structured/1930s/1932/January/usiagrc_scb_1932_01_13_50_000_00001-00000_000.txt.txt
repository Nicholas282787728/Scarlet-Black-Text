Clark are sharing top honors in the
A division, while Smith, Gates, and
(Langan are in a tie for the lead in
the B division.

Rawson‘s A team officially opened
lttle season Saturday with a victory
over the Gates outfit by a 10 to 7
iscore, in a game in which it led
practically all of the way. At no time
aﬂel‘ the first quarter did Gates scr-
iously threaten. Buhlman and Pen-
quite scored two baskets each for

led the Gates attack, The Gates B

tack, while Wurl and Canavan ac-
counted for all of Rawson’s points.

In thc other two games of the at-
ternoon, Dihhle and Langen split
honors. A basket by Brown with so
seconds of play left gave the defends
ing champions a one point victory
over Langan, 14 to 13. Although Fer-
raro scored 10 points in the B team,
Langan bested the Dibblites by one
point also, 16 to 15, by virtue of
Welsh's accurate eye.

On Monday afternoon, Clark's A
team trounced the Smith representa-
tives, 22 to s. with Bennett, Edwards.
and Rnwatt each making three bas-
kets. Throughout the first half, play

Clark, winning 14-5
