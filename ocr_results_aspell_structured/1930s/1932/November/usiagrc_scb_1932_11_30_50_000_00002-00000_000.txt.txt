Although possessing perhaps
the most difficult position on the

of youth was clearly displayed ill

TUITION TENDENCIES
(Cornelllan)

In the November issue of the Eu!»
letln of the American Association of
University Professors the fact is re-
vealed that Millsaps college is adopt-
ing a system in which the student
making a. high grade avcrage will
pay less tuition. The pnhlicatlon
'states that the Student. having a
grade average of above 90 will pay
25 per cent less tuition upon enroll-
ment the next fall. The extra-poor
student, or the student having an av-
age below 75, will pay 25 per cent
more tuition.

What will this do in the way of
making for scholarship? There is no
doubt that with the present depres—
sion the movement will cause grades
to mean more and in turn force the
students to work harder. It is also
certain that the institution should
help the better student, After all, the
good worker learn: more quickly,
causes the faculty less worry, and has
a better chance for success if one is

,lng for grades. there will

to believe the statistics Harvard has

gathered
grades.

Looking at the other side, students
may lose desire to take par-t in out-
side activities which are truly of
value to those taking part. In work—
be the
chance to lose the Rim in going to
college and the methods of cheating
or “getting by" will be increased,
Perhaps each day's assignments
would be regarded as so many les-
sons to bc memorized rather than so
many lessons to be understood.

If the system is to be successful,
there will be tbc necessity of dealing
in a special way with the student
who is earning a large share of his
expenses. This type of student is of-
ten to be praised for the good grade:
that he does make, considering the
time spent in earning money. Cornell
professors often mention the gradu—
ate who is now successful but when
in Cornell made very poor grades be-
cause of outside work. This is true of
every college.

Considering the action from both
sides, one sees the change that is tak-
ing place in American colleges. the
increased stress on scholarship.
Whether the method to be tried by
Millsaps is a good one or not should
be of interest to all.

“DEPRESSION" COACHING
(The Stanford Daily)

Them was a time when football
games were won with men and strat-
egy in battles of brawn on the grl
iron itself. Then, coincidental with
the popularization of the sports as
the smart topic for discussion of
debuntantc tee parties, the entire
conception of how games are won,
and where. suffered a change. Sports
writers, tired of pounding out daily
reports on the condition of the star
halfback's ingrown nail, found a new
nail, found a new element to drivel
about, ballyhooed it into a popularity
far cutweighihg its worth. and clev-
erly dubbed it‘ “psychology." "'Und‘er~
dog" immediately tool-("on a new Sig»
nlficnnce in the repertoire of the
sporting lscrib'e as a. term: describing
the winner of any contest.

The euphoiiy of a comparatively
new scientific term with an “ology”
on the end of it held a certain fascino
ation for the hoi polloi. thereby in~
creasing the popularity of metropoli-
tan sports pages.‘ The public, the
newspapers, and the sports writers
were haying their fun and the merry
result held no real harm.

No damage was done. that is, until
a number of major coaches began to
take it all to heart and, through
some unhappy mental process. cons
csived the idea that half of every bat-
tie is won in print before ever a cleat
has dug into the turf. Establish your
team as the underdog, they now ap-
parently believe, and it's all over but
the postrgamc victory song.

Perhaps occasionally an underdog,
the team that ordinarily would be the
weaker, has upset its rival because
that rival was overrconfident. This
underdog has fought harder because
it has KNOWN that fight alone could
win. that in man—power and strategy
it was definitely the weaker. “Psy-
chology," if you will, of this sort is
genuine. however seldom it wins a
ball game.

.But it is the coach who tells his
team it has hardly a chance when he
lmows that it has a good chance. who
days before a game weeps to the
press and the public that the cons
test is already as good as lost, the
coach who drums on the subject so
continually that he actually develops
in his own men a defeatist attitudei
that i the coach who is working to
death “psychology." as well as his
chances for championship-

PLAYING FOOTBALL SETUPS

(From The Des Molnes Register)

Some of the nationally famous
sports writers are_complaining again
about the old‘ American custom of
football setups after certain eastern
college papers started the cri sm,
And why not? For the unprejudiced
onlooker. there is no more sport in a
football game that runs to a score of
so to 0 than in a prizefight between
a good heavyweight and a mediocre
middleweight.

”I hold.” says Walter Damon Run»
you, "that any football game that
shows one team ahead by 30 or more
points at the end of the first half
ought to he called right there on the
ground of no contest. I am serious
about this. 1 say that another half
hour of mauling of a palpably out-
classed tcam ceases to be a sport."

Now there will be those who will
contend that the practice of standing
small school squads up against steam
rollers is one of the few remaining
evidences of nomprot'c'ssionalism in
college athletics But the argument
is hardly tcnablc. The small school
coach sometimes enjoys the Ilme~
light even at heavy cost to his team,
and the star halfback is likely to his
eluted at the potential opportunity of
making a sensational run against his
famous adversaries and thereby mak-
ing a name for himself.

Even the students of the relatively

concerning success and

 

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

unknown college are quite proud to
say, “We're playing Harvard this
year!" And diey just assume the
playeis will lose by eight touchdowns.
Meanwhile the dear old almo mater
gets an unaccustomed cut on gatc ic-
ceipts and enough publicity to build
up ticket sales for the next contest

The only reason all this is possible
is that college football still has a dc-
pendable attendance grounded in
sentiment rather than on thc merits
of the particular game. The student
tickets are usually sold in season
batches, so they may as well be used
even though the home boys an: only
playing Podunk. It won’t work any
other way. The New York Yankees
couldn't pay for the baseballs with
the receipts from a game against the
Waterville SemirPros.

But Mr. Runyoirs proposed rule
will never be accepted. Though the
tally is 40 to 0 at the end of the half,
Podunk always has a chance to score
and that means a halo for somebody.
And then there is the cycle of sport,
which sees even big schools now wi ,
ning and now losing, sometimes by
tremendous scores and second half re-
versals of first half triumphs.

So far as the practice of making

obvious and deliberate mismatches
goes, howeveriand that is what is
being criticisedrit ought. to be
stopped. The Harvard Crimson and
the Yale News, which are scolding
vigorously against the practice, are
absolutely right.
The corollary argument that even
among “big” schools games should
be scheduled only with teams whose
athletic systems and practices are
such as to make something like even
competition possible, is a sound argue
ment, too.

“The men who were successful in

“James J. Hill, the empire builder,
saw his fondest. dreams of the de-
velopment of the great northwest,
realized; John D. Rockefeller had a
dcep faith in American business.

“The war was the apothesis of
American Selfrassurnnce and optim-
ism. The fatuous nineteenstwentles
reduced this optimism to its absurd-
ity.”

“The ‘new are] is the term gener~
ally applied to a new economic phil-
osophy, which regarded prosperity as
the normal condition. When the crash
came, the typical attitude of Ameri:
can polit‘ lens and business men wan
one of optimism. But business has
failed to respond to such treatment.”

"In the future we are going to need
optimitic tendcncies as never before.
but that is not enough. We must
face the problems that beset us in
the fight of new economic condi-
tions.”
