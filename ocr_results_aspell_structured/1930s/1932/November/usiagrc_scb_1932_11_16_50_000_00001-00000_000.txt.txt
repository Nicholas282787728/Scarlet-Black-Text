berths and the other will be contested .
by several men. Don Malum, who was
all—city guard in his prep days at
North High in Des Moines, will prob-
ably start as one of the guards and
Jack Hatfield at the other. Torn Mc—
Guire is rated as the best center on
the prep squad.

In the backfield there is :1 great
deal of competition and Truesdale
will have two or three sets of men to
utilize. One of the best combinations
in the last game included James
Bradley. flashy Indian, at quarter-
back; Julius Bauers and Bob mum
at hall‘s, and limes, fullback. Bauers
distinguished himself with his ability
to heave lengthy passes. Bradley is
a capable triple threat man. Although
injured at the time of the last game
Bud Haupert will be given a chance
to earn his numeral in the Waterloo
tilt.

All Students Exhibit Work
at Indiana, Herran Instilule

An exhibition of work by the stu—
dio classes in art was shown, during
the homecoming week-end, in the
quadrangle sun-room, between Main
hall and Mears cottage, so that those
of the alumni who were not here at
commencement time last June might
have an opportunity to See what the
department has been doing.

This is the exhibit which was orig-
inally prepared for the annual cons
vention of the Western Arts associ-
ation in St. Louis last spring where
it attracted much attention.

In August it was shown in the
Grinnell booth at the state fair and

they were displayed following a show-
ing by special request at the John

Grinnell Squad to Leave
for Oklahoma
Tonight

The only obstacle remaining in the
path of a conference championship
for _a hard-riding bunch of Oklahoma
A. and M. Cowboys, Coach L. L.
(Fuzz) Watt’s Grinncll eleven will
make its last appearance of the 1932
season, at Stillwater Friday night
under the floodlights.

The Pioneer squad, numbering ap~
proximately 22 or 23 men, will leave
Grinnell tonight southward bound.
They will thus be given a chance to
become acclimated to the warm
southern climate, which will be quite
a change from the frigid weather now
gripping Iowa.

Undergoes Operation

A minor operation Monday upon
Dick Illlrich, the mainstay of the
Pioneer backfield, has been a source
of worry to Coach Watt. Although
latest reports say that Ullrich will be
in condition to play. he will be far
from the best shape. Should he not
be ready for action, Wes Clark or
Vic Fini will be called upon to fill
his place.

Ullrich, who has been the out-
standing man on the crinnell team
during the entire season. will be
playing his last game as a member
of the Pioneer football team, as will
Captain Graflund. Duncan, James,
Martin, and Figland. Bowlby, Alex-
ander, Murphy, and St. John, a unar-
tet of reserves, are all seniors and
will wear the scarlet and black uni-
form for the last time.

Mediocre Season

The season has only been Inader»
atcly successful for the Grinnell team,
an eleven which seems to contain
all sorts of pent-up dynamite and yet
which has seemed unable to keep go-
ing at a steady clip. A victory over
the first place Aggies, who have been
acclaimed one of the best teams in
the country, would be a fitting cli-
max.

Lynn Waldorf‘s Cowboys have
beaten Drake and Creighton, and
will clinch the title if they can hurdle
the Pioneer obstacle. If the Grinnell
team should spring a surprise, the
championship would go to Creighton.
who has completed her conference
schedule, winning tnree games and
losing one.

Coach Watt sent his mcn through
short signal drills both Monday and
Tuesday. and then ordered them in—
side because of the extreme cold. He
is taking no chances on having any
of his men injured before the Aggie
fray.

The traditional burning of the shoe,
an annual ceremony which marks
the season's last practice, was
scheduled for this afternoon. follow
ing the day’s workout.

Coach Wett’s starting lineup Fri»
day night will probably not be varied
much, with the exception of the
tackle positions. Gould is a certain
starter at left tackle, and Morgan or
Sutton is likely to get the call at
right tackle. Sutton may he used at
a guard position where he started
against Creighton last week. If U114
rich is not ready. Craflund, James,
Rose, and Clark or Fini will compose
the Pioneer backfield.
