SATURDAY FEBRUARY 27, 1932 '

After 834 Days
of Piloting Plane
Brock Here Today

Having gained national repute as
the subject of Robert L, Ripley’s car»
toon, “Believe it or Not," inst Satur-
day, John D. Brock, Kansas City, Mo.,
arrived in Grinnell by plane at 11 a.
m. today for a conference with Louis
V. Phelps, Crinnell college treasurer,
after 834 consecutive days of flying.

Brock, with John J. Van Ever-a, '05,
Grinnell college representative in
Kansas City. flew here in two hours
this morning from the southern city
in a Monocoupe equipped with a
special motor.

Aeronautics Director

For more than two years. Brock.
who is aeronautics director of the
Kansas City chamiicr of commerce,
has flown one of his three planes
every day for flights of from 15 mine
utes to five hours. His husiness card
expresses his sentiment with the 3107
gan, “A Flight a Day Keeps the Doc-
tor Away."

Last Saturday was Bl‘ock‘s 827th
consecutive day of flying, and the
cartoonist, Ripley, made him the sub-
ject of his daily syndicated feature.

First Visit

The aviator-business man is the
owner of a lens grinding establish—
ment in Kansas City, located in a
building owned hy Grinnell college.

This was Mr. Brook’s first visit to
Crinnell. His passenger, van Evera,
upon landing here, pointed to a small
rural school house next to the Grin»
nell airport and remarked upon the
coincidence of his landing within a
short distance of the school which he
attended when a bay.

Lost in Storm

But Brock has an even better story
than that. Some time ago, after viss
iting the capitols and important cities
of every state in the union, he be—
came lost in a rain storm, flying
above the Kentucky river, and finally
landed in a pasture.

After some time. a shy mountain
lad came over to the plane to volun-
teer the information that the flyer
was within several miles of the town,
Crah Orchard, Ky., which was the
hirthplace of Brock-s father arm
which he had never visited in his
life.

“And it was the first time during
my tour that 1 had not landed in an
airport, too," Brock added.

Wife Doesn’t. Mind ,, _ .

Flying is the Kansas City man's
hohhy. He once made approximately
120 landings in the United States and
four in Canada within 29 days.

His wife does not mind his flying
at all, Brock says. He me once re-
ported killed. but Mrs. Brock hung tip
the telephone receiver and would not
listen to or,helieve the story being
told her because the plane found was
not on the course which her husband
had told her he would take.

After a hrief.husiness session with
Treasurer Phelps this noon. the fly»
ing pair left for Kansas city at 1:30
p. in.

And Brock intends to maintain his
”flight a day” schedule as long as “he
is ahlel"

Closes Career _

Captain McCreary will wrnd up a
three-year career at the head of one
of the most successful cage teams
here in recent years. He will probalily
be assigned the task of guarding
Francis Z'lmmach, smallest member-
of the invading team,

Mccreary rose to prominence in
the middle of the season two years
ago, and made possihle the combinar
tion of Douglas and McCi-eary which
functioned so well last year. Despite
the fact that he is the shortest play-
er in the Valley conference, he has
outplayed a numhcr of larger men.
He recently held Frank Smith, Oma—
ha's sophomore find, goallcss in the
struggle at Des Moines.

Split Lust Year

Pal ed with McCreary, will he Dick
Ullricli, who will he faced with the
job of holding down Gorychka, giant
Marquette forward, who will out-
weigh Ullrich by 25 pounds.

Last year the Pioneers split with
the Milwaukee team, but were re—
cently beaten 43 to 29 on the Mar-
quette floor.

By H. w. MATLACK

it is no news to say that Harald
B. Holst, or the faculty, is a singer
whose appearances invariably show
Command of his hit, but his recital
last night, the first .iiice his return
from a year of study. showed how his
mastery is growing by leaps and
‘hounds, in quality, range, and ex-
pressiveness.

He had clmscn an interesting list
of songs covering many types of e
pr-cssion, from one of F‘Igm‘o’s hhi.
tei-ing arias in Mozait’s lmmox‘l'll
comedy, through a splendid sclecti
of German songs and some English
lsongs of varying degrees of merit, to
the “Vision Fugitive," the big aria
'froni Massenet's Herodiadc, which he
sang as a final encore.

Mr. Holst was at his hcst in the
finest sullgs, which were very fine
indeed, standing out. each of them,
as a poetic gern. But he even could,
and did. enter with enthusiasm into
jazzed-up arrangement of an old hoe-
down, which of course took even a
musically educated audience by storm
proving that there is still plenty of
the old Adam in the best of us. But
at the other end of the scale his Slugs
ing of the Mozart aria was of real
virtuoso caliber, and his Schumann
and Schuhert songs were in the same
category.

In all this he enjoyed the talented
collaboration of Elsie Haggai-d Ryan
(Mrs. John P), who was his accom-
panist. She read into every accom-
paniment just what the composer
imagined. so that it became more than
a mere hackgrorrnd. and hecame an
integral part of the tonal texture.

Many of the accompaniments are
really piano pieces of independent
suhstance, more difficult than lots of
recital pieces, Mrs. Ryan was right
there with every shade of expression
