The day for the dual meet with
Carleton at Northficld, Minn., Friday
was almost ideal for a track meet.
The sky was clear, the wind was
still, and the atmosphere was warm
enough to make recordabl‘eaking

times possible. ~

ctr

Just to show how excellent the
track conditions were, Burt Holmes
ran the 440 in :51.2, according to
Coach Duke’s watch. but failed to
place, coming in fourth. Last week
captain Thomas traveled the distance
in :51.6 and broke the Creighton-
Grinneli meet record by .4 of a sec»

and.

to:

Thomas ran a great race at Caric-
ton to nose out Nuhs Nuhert by a
step in the 440, and turned in his
fastest time of the year. breaking
the track record. Thomas ran a :495
quarter. and now holds the school
records at three schools,7Carleton,
and the indoor marks at Iowa state

and Drake.

oo-

Equally as outstanding as Thomas
feat was that of Dick Murphy, Pio~
neer co-captain, in turning in a 1:573
half—mile. Murphy stayed on the heels
of Cal'leton's great distance star, Don
Mcnae, and passed him on the back
stretch to uncork a terrific sprint at
the end that caused McRae to-fold
up at the finish,

so.

Murphy has been improving rapid~
ly of late, and is consistcntly hctter-
ing two minutes in the 830. He will
make a, desperate effort to annex the
Missouri valley half-mile crown, and
gain revenge for previous defects at
the hands of Leonard Gallagher.

o AHAAA change was made
in tlic personnel of the Lwo~man
contingent from the Missouri Valley
conference who will make de-
termincd bids for places on the Uni»
ted states Olympic team, after a tee
view of conference performances in
the middle west‘s two gigantic relay
carnivals, the Kansas and Drake rc-
lays,

The defeat which Myron Filbrow
sufiered in the Z—mile run at the
hands of Henry Brocksmith,, brilliant
Indiana distance ace, practically re—
moves the sturdy Grinnell star as a
contender for the Olympic team. He
still leads all conference athletes at
the distance, however, and he is like»
ly to break the Valley record when
the conference meet is held here this
weekend,

into Pilhmw's place stepped Bert
Nelson. lanky Butler university high
jumper. Nelson cleared six feet three
and one»half inches in the carnival
at Des Moines to_ win first place
and to beat out Ehrlich of Kan-
sas state and Newlick of Oklahoma,
the high jump aces of the Big Six
conference. His mark bettercd the
Missouri Valley conference record
for the event. The old mark was six
feet. three and one-eighth inches
made by Tom Poor of Kansas in 1925.
Nelson's mark will not stand as a
conference record, however, since all
records must be made in conference
meets,

The Circuit's other Olympic candi-
date did not compete in the Drake or
Kansas events. and it is probably
just as well that he was not among
those in the race at Des Moines, for
even such a brilliant dash ace as
Peyton class, II, of Oklahoma A.

Ralph Metealfe, the Marquette negro
star. Metcalfe tied the accepted
