TRIVIALITIES

~The women of the quadrangle,
and Grinllell students and facul-
ty ill general, were more than
mildly incensed at the article
which appeared in Wednesday’s
Des Moines Register following the
death of Luella J. Food, (loan of
women.

The article (leveled much space
to a description of Grinnell’s
smoking rooms, oiling them as
Miss Road’s accomplishment. This
is certainly an injustice, for Miss

in so many ways that it is unfair

didctes in the coming election." Most
people who couldn’t name one of
these kings had the same troublei
even after reading all about the can-
dizlates,

“I know the economic theories of
Malthus and Adam Smith, but I can
not live within my income." Living
within one's income has nothing to
do with the thcories of these two eco-
nomics; it is c matter of common
sense, which educators admit they
cannot teach to some persons.

“1 can recognize the “leit-motif"
of c Wagner opera, but I cannot sing
a tune.’ Since when has it been the
duty of c university to teach its stu—
dents o sing?

“I can explain the principle of by
draulics, but 1 cannot fir a leak in
the kitchen faucet." Fel‘haps Miss
Freeman should have gone to a trade
school and taken up plumbing.

“I can read the plays of Molierc in
the original, but I cannot order a
meal in French." If Miss Freeman is
not bragging, we would like to point
out that with most French students
we know the situation is just the op-
pcsie.

“I have studied the psychology of
James and Tichcncr but I cannot
control my temper. If we stopped
studying psychology with James and
Tichener we Wouldn't be able to’ con-
trol much of anything.“

"I can conjugate Latin verbs, but I
cannot write legibly." Cheer up. Miss
Freeman, many people cannot do
either.

“I can recite hundreds of lines of
Shakespeare. but I do not know the
Declaration of Independence, Lin-
cohi's Gettysburg Address. or the
23rd Fsalmn." If we were Miss Free-
man we would be very happy about
this. ‘

Most criticisms against universi-
ties are easy to forget, but the
thought of Miss Freemcn sitting in
her room solving quadratic equations,
naming the kings of England since
the War of Roses, explaining to her-
self the principle of hydraulics, and
conjugating Latin verbs while all the
time she is just dying to ask for a
piece of bread in German, sing in
tune, fix that leak in her kitchen
faucet, or recite the Declaration of
Independence—all this tugs at our
heart strings, It makes us want to
do something about the modern edur
ccticnal system.

Although mythiecl “all” selections
mean little as for as determining the
actual worth of a player, it is sig
nificant to find what the consensus
of sports where is now that the
flurry of picking thme teams is just
about over. As far as the Missouri
Valley conference is concerned, there
was more or less unanimity of
choice by the various scribch for
awhile, but lately the selections have
become more varied. 0n the first
team, especially did the critics agree,
but recently opinions have not oonr
formed to the earlier choices.

“Logarithms.”

The class in advance calculus will
give instruction on numerical tables

professor of mathematics, will be in

R's themselves, which, with all due
respect to our educational system,
are practically all that one learns in
the average schccl up to the age of
fourteen, constitute an adequate edu-
cation.

In truth, all may not be fit for a
university education, or, perhaps. ev»
en for the later years of secondary
school, but let th qualifications be
scholastic, not economic. It is a poor
democracy that reserves education
only for those whose fathers can givc

“Literature derives from life, but

“Life becomes literature when

“Art goes out to life and illus-
