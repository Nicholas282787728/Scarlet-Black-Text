THE VARSITY CLUB

Why is it that the Valsity club is not being
suppolted this year? Certainly it is a money sa1ing
p1 opositlon for those who regula1l1 attend dances
at Gliuuell But at the present time oilly a few of
these elllb tickets have been sold. Surely there will
be as many attending tllc dances as in previous
years.

From all economic standpoint 110 olle can deny
the benefits to be derived from being a member of
tlle Varsity club. General admission to all dances
ranges from $1 to $1.50. wllile with a Varsity club
ticket varsity dances 11 ill cost the holder only 35
cents, and the club ticket sells for the price of one
(lance, $1.50.

In addition to the val ity dances throughout
the year, holders of club tickets may buy formal
dance tickets at a reduced rate. Because of the
money on hand through the sale of club tickets, the
recreation committee can be assured of a certain
amount with which to bring good orchestras to
Grillnell» instead of gambling on the crowd that
will turn out, and thereby necessitate hedging 011
the price of the orchestra, which means an inferior
orchestra.

Hearty support of the Valsity club means good
orchestras. All students want good orchestras at a
lower price to themselves. Support the Varsity
club.

THOMAS FOR PRESIDENT

Unsatisfied with the two leading party candle
dates for president of the United Statc ft number
of students will gather tomorrow for the initial
meeting of the “Thomas for’l’l'csident” club.

Although Norman Thomas is the Socialist
party’s candidate, a number of otherwise conserva-
tive students are supporting him; largely because
they, like everyone else, are seeking a man to lend
them back into ”prosperity”, and they think
Thomas is the mun to do it.

We do not wish to give the impression that
we are supporting T110111 The Scarlet and Black
is 110111)th ill—~50 far as politics is concerned.

But, we do wish to commend the few students
who are taking all active interest in the approach
ing electiolliregardless of what candidate they
are supporting.

For the first time in history, all tllr e candi-
dates have been. or will be, ill Iowa (1111' lg their
stumping tour. Usually a cut ill Republican state,
Iowa is extremely doubtful this year and the col-
lege vote may be enough to swing the state any
one of the three ways open.

THE PROVERBIAL STRAW?

I11 the midst of this turmoil called tlcprcs on,
the presidential election may come as thc proverbial
straw on the camel’s back, or. as we all hope. it
may be the Sign at the turn of the road. To make

WHAT IS COLLEGIATE?
(College Life)

I suppose you could call him collegiate. That is,
he wears nice clothes, and enjoys dancing, He's got a
roadster and he likes to drive around with the top
down. In the summer he can ride a surf board with a
girl on his shoulders. On top of all that, be attends one
of those big glamorous California schools where they'd
rather be halfback than president.

Sure, call him collegiate if you want to. But be
careful what. you mean when you call him thatibecause
I've got some dope on him, and it's the truth. so help
me.

This spring vacation he happened to be en the
beach. There was a big commotion at the water's edge.
and when he broke through the crowd he saw two
spent swimmers prone on the sand. The third of the
trio was out beyond the breakerska long way outiaud
he couldn't get back in.

Well, two or three started into the surf and the
breakers fought them back. Two or three others tried
to man a boat, but she'd go bow over stern every time
they tried. One fellow bad dashed off to get his air-
plane so he could drop a life-preserver down.

But the rest just stood and looked on. Once in
a while you coul'd see the spent swimmer's head bobbing
like a float. ’

So the collegiate stripped down to his 5“» and
handed the classmate his shirt: ”You wave the direction
with the shirt," he said, and the next minute he was
out through the breakers. It was a long way out. but
he made it. "If you fight, I'll duck you," was all he
said when he got out. And it was a longer way back,
but he made that too, bringing the other fellow with
him.

Now comes the best part.

He went to his room to take a hot bath and get
warm, but the first thing he knew a reporter was
perched on the edge of the tub. asking questions. Over-
head was the fellow in the airplane looking for the
swimmer.

He had a dinner enpgement with his mother and
father that evening and he was an hour late. He ex-
plained it by saying he’d been swimming. but they knew
he didn't have his suit and there was a devil of a jackpot
when his mother found he'd been swimming in his
shorts!

But pretty soon the Associated Press called up,
and the United Press, and a photographer, and the
telegrams began coming in: It dawned upon him grad-
ually. that he’d done something that everybody can't
do, something everybody wouldn’t. do if they could.

Sure, call him collegiate if you want to. But don't
mean Slick hair and wide pants when you say it.

COLLEGE BABBLE
(Daily Texan)

It has become the custom of college men and
women to talk endlessly about nothing and the result
is a, light-headed discourse. It is becoming a habit to
babble for hours without saying a sensible word. Non-
sense phrases are trite.

Soon it will be necessary for such a person to re-
main absolutely silent when he or she is in a. formal
or even sensible atmosphere. (The chief rason for this
lack of sensible entertainment.) However, human beings
are going to have recreation, and if this recreation is
not. provided for it will be created. Probably an unfor-
tunate creation. The only remedy possible is a provision
for this recreation.

What college men and women need is recreation
which is aesthetic, educational or in some way profit-
able to the growth of the individual. idleness does not
only result in evilness but also in light headiness and
thoughtless conversation.

Neither fear,
Martial.

department spoke in chapel Thurs-

and really accomplish so little.

“To become really cultured and
educated takes many yea s of study
and experience." he said. "It can not
be gained in a few weeks or months."
