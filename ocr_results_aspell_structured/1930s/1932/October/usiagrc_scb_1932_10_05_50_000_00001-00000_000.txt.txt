der of that semester at the end of
which time he may he released by the
dean of men upon application by the
student. The second offense shall res

ent suspension, according to the

mittee.”

No Frosh oars

"Permission to maintain a car
while in residence will be given to no
freshman except for a proved business
purpose, No upper classman will be
permitted to have a car here unless
his scholastic standing and personal
record merit the privilege Such per-
mission may be withdrawn at any
time when the dean of men or the
Administrative Committee believe the
student's record demands the with
drawal of permission."

“No student who receives assistance
or employment from the college or
through the cooperation of the col-
lege shall be permitted. to maintain a
car here. Any student receiving such
aid in any form who does bring a
car here will be considered to have
formited that aid."

Need Farents’ Consent

“No application for permission to
maintain a car here will be consider-
ed until the student’s parents have
signified in writing to the dean of
men their desire for the son to have
a car here and th ‘r acceptance of
complete responsibility for all risks
in relation thereto ~

"No woman attending Grinnell col—
lege may have a car while in resi-
dence.”

“Every student whose parents re-
side in Crinnell and who wishes to
drive the family car is required to
register the car at the office of the
dean of men, but he docs not have to
secure the dean's perm . on to drive
a car. So long as Grinncll resident
town students do not abuse this
privilege, complete responsibility in
relation to student automobiles is left
with them and their parents." ,

VALLEY SCHEDULE
Friday

Oklahoma A. a M. at Drake (night).
Saturday

Marquette at Creighton (ulght).

Butler at Cincinnati.

Grillllell at Michigan State.

Drury at Washlngtou (night).

Facing the most formidable oppon-
ent on their 1932 schedule approxi-
mately 22 Grinnell college foot-
ball warriors will embark tomor-
row evening for East Lansing, Michi-
gan, where they will tackle Sleepy
Jim Crowley’s crack Michigan State
eleven Saturday afternoon.

Just exactly who will make the
long trip is unknown at the present
time, but it is almost a certainty that
each of the 11 lettermcn on the squad
will go, unless serious injury befalls
them in the meantime. In the back-
field, Alexander, Fini, and Clark will
undoubtedly be selected to aid the
starting quartet of Ullrich, Rose,
James, and Captain Craflnnd.

Sophomores to be Included

0f the sophomore linemen, McMille
in. Morgan, Sutton, and Phelps have
nearly cinched a berth for themselves.
Coach VVatt‘s regular lineup for the
forward wall has been Duncan and
McKee at ends, Gould and Lake at
tackles, Rosenbloom. Martin, and Fig-
land guards, and McMillin or Bowl-
hy, center, and it is probable that all

-of these men Will be included in the

Pioneer caravan.

Every member of the Grinuell
squad saw action in last week's Cor—
hell game with the exception of those

,on the injured list. Rosenbloom. Fini,

and Bowlhy, all of whom were bother-
ed with leg injuries. This trio was
out for practice Monday, however,
and will probably be in shape for the
encounter with Michigan State.
Ullrich Nurses Sore Thumb

Monday saw James and Lake on

the sidelines, however, but neither are
afflicted with serious injuries and will
be ready for action soon. Ullrich was
bothered by an injured thumb Mon»
day and Tuesday, while several minor
charleyhorses were distributed
among the members of the squad.
l Monday‘s session was only a light
drill, because of a steady drizzle
which lasted all afternoon, Workouts
,on Tuesday and Wednesday were
heavier, but tomorrow the work will
taper off.

The most surprising development
of last week's genre was the showing
of Wesley Clark, sophomore from
Chicago, who instilled a mllchcneerled
spirit of confidcncc in the team.
