POLITICS IN COLLEGE

One marvels at the political
activity in the college in which
so many iioiirvotei's take a noisy
if not particularlv effective part.
Mauvstiidents hr 'e not as yet at
tained to a sufficient age to en-
able them to vote, but that does-
n’t keep them from attending rc-
ligioiisly all the meetings of their
particular party, and taking an
active part in the discussions held
there. ‘

This pro-voting age interest is
not found to a very great extent
outside of colleges hilt it is It
splendid, llealtlli‘ thing. it offers
«Valuable instruction to minds that
are used to learning things, and
there is no doubt, that many 19
and 20 year old Students could
vote ill the, coming election much
more intelligently that some 13604
ple who “ere horn a few years
earlier.

The older people. perhaps have
n more niati ' judgment, but
consider the \ lining eolllllinatioli
when the person “'llG has rot-e Pd

AIR HEROES

Iii these times there is no silh—
ject of such universal interest as
the modern air mail service. Very
rarely does a mail plallc land or
take off that it does it have an
audience. But. we wonder how
many people there are who are,

familiar il‘itli. iiot the famous fly- -
ers. plihlic heroes who have (lone ,

spectacular things, hut the old

time pilots who umtlc the scrvicc

what we now have.
Jack Knight flew the first coast

to coast air mail before there \\‘('l‘r\ .

route that “‘0 associate with

news by remarking at the air rat‘-
es a few yea' ago that the pres~
out air mail service made him feel
somewhat like the old time cork

the San Francis orSalt Lake route

Lee, R. G. Page. Boonstra, Weslev
A. Smith, one could go on iiideii
itely naming men who had the
courage to make it through no
matter what the weather.

And so we have the air mail,
Chicago to San Francisco in less
than twenty-four hours, the modc
ei‘ii product of a modern age.

Thursduy

Ear] D. Strong, professor of Econ-
omics spoke in chapel. on the balanc-
ing of work.

“There is a good deal of confusion
in regard to the real meaning of the
word worlc" he said, “but the two
factors which determine what is
work are the objective and the dur-
ztion."

“Activities which have the objec-
tive of earning is living are Work"

"The mther factor in thc dcfmi on
of work is duration. The most thrillr
ing jobs eventually bccomc irksome.
Dcclinc in satisfaction may be slow
in cases where a high degree of men—
tal activity is required, but it is fast.
in mm unskilled labor, where the
joy of creation is sapped by mass
production and specialization."

“We can not stop the advancing
machine age, but wc ecu create
more leisure," Professor strong cle-
clcred. “Men work. not. for money,
but. the leisulc and security which
money buys. The best Solution for
our prcscut involuntary unemploy~
ment is to give work to more men
for fewer hours, so that they may
have sufficient funds for security,
and enough leisum for enjoyment
and recreation."

Friday

Donald F. Grass, professor of
Business Administration, spoke on
the background of thought which
determines business ethics.

“In the Middle Ages,” he said,
“economic writers believed value to
be quality residing in an object. This
value was called the “fair price", and
it. was determined by the value of
the spirit of the producer which cm-
bodied itself in the article.”

“When men held such an objec-
tive idea of the fixed worth of- an
article, it was only natural that
they should try to outwit each other
and drive hard bargains. While some»
thing of this spirit remains in the
modern business world, a ncw atti-
tude is clearly discemable.

This new attitude is based on mod~
em psychological theories that.
value resides in the minds of people
and that the subjective value which
they placed upon an article determ-
ines the value which the price they
arc willing to pay for it.

“In such a case, an exchange
means satisfaction for both parties.
This principle is known in the mod~
el‘n business world as service. and
all permanent success it built upon
this» Christianizcd attitude of mutual
helpfulness."

E buy the ﬁnest, the

does not explainwhy folks
everywhere regard Lucky
Strike as the mildest ciga-
rette. The fact is, we never
overlook the truth that
“Nature in the Raw is

aging and mellowing, are
