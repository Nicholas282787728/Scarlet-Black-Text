Traditional ‘Hell Week' Cut
to Single Day, Night
in New Plan

Probation dsy, formerly known as
hell week, has been set for Decem—
ber s, by the Council of House Fresh
dents. This is in accordance with the
revised plan for prepping, announced
by the council, Nov. 19, which states
that once each semester there shall
be aprobation day, lasting one day
and one night. No definite plans for
the day have been made by the coun.
oil.

The completion of the revlsed plan
for prepping marks the first time
that a uniform procedure in this
matter has been attempted in all six
of the men's dormitories. The plan

‘Gitta Gardova, Woman Pianist, Will

Appear on Concert Series Here Dec. 2

Gitta Gradova, whom many cri ics
have named as the greatest living
woman pianist, will play here Friday
evening, Dec. 2 at 8:00 in Herrick
chapel.

Though still in her middle twenties
and laden already with more praise
than it wen-ls possible one small per-
son can comfortably carry, Mme.
Gradovn has remained in spite of all,
an unspoiled, thoroughly normal girl.

She believes firmly in what Shaw
has called “the sanity of art," She
sees her immensely successful career
merely in the light of an opportunity
to reveal as clearly as she can the
messages of the composers whose
music she interprets.

Scriabin ceases to be an enigma
when she plays his works. Each is
no longer pondercus. Mme. Gradova
does not look on a page of printed
music as an assortment of symbols
corresponding to keys on the piano.

To her it is the composer's thought.
and her brilliant technique goes on-
tirely to turning this thought into
tone.

It is the conccnsus of critical opin-
ion that the recent enforced absence
from the concert stage. which Mme.
Giadova had to undergo because of
a serious accident, in no way im-
pared her astounding powers of tech
nique or interpretation.

For two seasons, this brilliant ar-
tist had to sit back, a helpless invalid,
her hip smashed in an automobile
crash, With no assurance that she
would ever be able to play again.

Now, happily, that dreadful period
is over. Completely restored to health
and in full possession of her marvel-
ous artistic powers, Mme. Gradova
returned to the concert field lost
season, appeared in recital and with
orchestras, and proved beyond doubt
that the promise of her genius has
not failed its flower.

Purposes of Prepping

The purposes of prepping as an—
nounced by the plan are seven in
numbe : to orientate the freshmen;
to did them in meeting everyday
problems with the proper mental atti—
tude; to aid them in maintaining good
scholastic' standing; to encourage
them to participate in the outside ac-
tivities in which they are most cap-
able; to impress upon them a respect
for elders; to imbue them with the
Grinnell spiri ~ and to aid their halls
in functioning in a more proficient
manner.

Prepping is to consist of six specific
branches. The first is a Sponsoryr
system in each hall. which is to con-i
sist of voluntary advisers to aid the
freshmen in all problems.

Those receiving instruction are
mostly freshmen who are having dif-
ficulties in beginning foreign lang-
uage courses or those who are behind
in their work.

However, the presence of a few
second year students in the groups
offers the possibility that a special
conversational class may be organi—
zed if a sufficient number is inter—
ested.

The present clones are being tried
only as an experiment as an aid to
both students in beginning and ads

yvaced languages. If they continue to

be as well attended as at present, it
is possible they will be held the re-
mainder of this semester and Continr

The Golden Avalanche thus far this

fall had defeated Lawrence college,
Boston college and Washington and
Jefferson; tied Creighton university.
and lost to Wisconsin, West Virginia
and the University of Detroit. Thus,
with three victories, three defeats and
a tie, a triumph is needed today to
give Coach Frank J. Murray his
eleventh consecutive successful year
on the Hilltop.

There was an added incentive in

the Drake game. Seven veteran let—

bit of varsity action and figured that
a victory march would harmonize
well with the proverbial swan song.
