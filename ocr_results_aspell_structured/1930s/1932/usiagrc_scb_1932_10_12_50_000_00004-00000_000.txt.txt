Force Jim Clmwley to Use‘
First String Men
Throughout

Led hy a driving quarterback, Dick
Ullrich, and a lanky sophomore half-
back, Wesley Clark, a fighting Crin-
nell college football eleven played a
powerful Michigan State team on al-
most even terms last Saturday, al-
though the latter team had the extra
punch needed to score in the crucial
moments, and won 27 to 6.

Completing 11 out of 13 forward;
passes, with Clark doing most of tlle‘
tossing, the Iowa team gained at will,
and it was necessary for coach Jlml
Crowley to keep his fil'stvstring line-
up on the field throughout most of‘
the game. ,

Even then the Spartans could not‘l
stop the deceptive Pioneer attack, for
the visitors scored a total of 15 first
downs to only 13 for the winners, and
carried the hall into scoring position,
four times.

Playing the best game of his career
so far, the stocky mlrich sent the ball
deep into Michigan State territory.
time after time, punting out of bounds
three times inside the 10~yard line, he
dashed off tackle for 48 yards on the
first play of the we, and directed;
the team that outgained their rivalsi
two to one in the last half.

First Quarter

Michigan state kicked off over goal
line. Ball put in play on Grinnell 20-‘
yard line, on first play, Ullrich crash-
ed through right tackle for 43 yards
before pushed out of hounds. Three.
attempts failed to gain, and Ullrich
punted out of hounds on State’s 7-
yard line. Eliowitz punted out of
hounds at midfield and Pioneers op-
ened up drive which took them to the
Spartan 23 yard line, but were then
thrown for a loss and mlrich kicked
out of bounds on 12-yard stripe. Elio-
witz's long run mode it first down on
Grinnell's 40-yard mark, and on next
play Monnett dashed remaining dis-
tance to goal line for first touchdown.
Score: Michigan state 7, Grinnell 0,

Passes brought the ball within scor-
ing distance after the kickoff and
Armstrong rambled over from 18-yard
line for second touchdown. Score:
Michigan State 14, Grinnell 0.

Second Quarter

Ullrich hit left tackle for 13 yards.
Pioneers made two more first downs.
hut lost hall on funihle on State's 45-
yard line. Eliowitz intercepted a Grin-
’nell pass after he had made a short
‘kick into Grinnell territory. and from
there the Spartans plunged to the 1-
foot line where Monnett went over.

‘Score: Michigan State 21. Grinnell 0

A short kick gave Grinnell the hall
on 42-yard line, and Pioneers ripped
through State team’s secondary de-
fense to take the ball to the 12-yard
line only to lose it on an intercepted
pass. Monnctt picked up 33 yards just
hefore half ended, leaving the hall in
midfield, Score: Michigan State 21,
Crinnell 0.

Third Quarter

Michigan State received kickoff
and marched down field to Crinnell
21-yard mark before a fighting de-
fense stopped them. Taking hall on
their 20-yard line, the crinnell offens-
ive once more went down the field,
with Ullrich and Graflund doing most
of the ball carrying. A punt by Ull-
rich which went outside on the 4-yard
line put the Pioneers at an advantage,
and after Eliowitz puntod short, Clark
took a lateral pass and scored from
the 12-yard line. Score: Michigan
State 21, Crinnell 6.

After the kickoff the Pioneers
threatened once again when a pass
from Clark. to Ullrich was good for
42 yards, placing the hall on the
State 7-yard line, but Spartan line
held and took hall on its 6-yard line
as quarter ended.

Fourth Quarter

The two teams exchanged punts
with the home team gaining slightly.
and finally putting the hall in position
to score after a Crinnell fumble. Jones
passed to Armstrong for the touch-
down. Score: Michigan state 27,
Grinnell 6.

The rest of the period saw Crinnell
in possession of the ball most of the
time. AS the game ended the Pioneers
were well on their way to the goal
line, after Graflund had taken a 22-
yard pass from Clerk.

“Hey, Mcitgllcrl” yelled a voice

neared the sidelines, ”who told you
you could play football?" To which
Mal'llettc's veteran end rotor-ted:
“That's all right. hut I've got rosin
