OUT OF PRACTICE

~We'all love our mothers whether we show it
01‘ not. However, that’s just the point. Shouldn’t
we Show it ll little more?

Tomorrow, it being Mother’s Day, most of us
will telephone. telegraph, or Send flowor
respective mothers. Wenvill be emllaru 'scd~if
‘ anyone sees us do i ~ilecause we are so much out
of practice.

That’s another point. Why should we ever
get out of practice? There are a lot of answers to
that question—none of them really very good. Per-
haps the best: alibi is that we are too bnsyillml’
we hovel t the time.

If we were to stop to think that over. we
would be ashamed that we ever lllentioued it.
Allvone of us, whether we are football stars or
‘grilltls”, can spare 15 minutes a (lay to write
home. If we have the have to think we can’t. we
should remember that our mothers have watr ed
over us and ”spared us” much more than 5
minutes it day. ever since we fi- t saw the l' lt of
(la boil hhppy ill our successes and consoli 51
us in oln failures.

a little of ours.

SEARCH-LIGHTS OVER WALL STREET

' (From the Dolly Trojan)

The [manual dominance of Wall street is at last.
challenged. The investigation of the. maneuvers of
financial speculators and jugglci-s on the stock moilcct
now being undertaken by the senate committee is a
gesture of hopefulness. If it accomplishes no more than
to throw o strong seerchlisht of publicity into the dark
corners of the financial structure, it will have at least
paved the way for reform.

Preceding this inquiry by several years, a book by
Professor Ripley of Harvard, entitled “Main Street and
Wall. Street,” castigated boldly some of the abuses of
the financial center, and even influenced Calvin Coolidge,
who was then president, to urge revision of sevcml evil
practices, some of which were accepted and carried out.
by the stock market leaders themselves. The problems
created by the present depression are of such c nature
as to demand governmental investigation.

It the senatorial inquisitors expect. merely to curtail
the activity of the bears and to force bull activity, they
are attempting something fotuous and futile. The late
Crash on Wall street was precipitated by the artificial
bull stimulstion of stocks upward. Bears and bulls are
complementary evils: the greater the skyrocketing of
stock prices, the more obyssmal the descent.

stock trading is all a merry exhibition of fireworks
to the rest of the population so long as only the spccu-
latcrs themselves are affected, but when our whole eco-
nomic system is knocked into a. cooked hat by the she
normal acquisitivcness of a few individuals, it is. no longs
er a joke. Granted that Wall street speculation is only
one of the causes of our present chsotic Situation. it is
nevertheless dynamite in our Social structure.

When the senate finishes its inquiry into Wsll street,
it might turn is searching look in the direction of Chi-
Cago‘s bocrd of trade, where wheat; futures are manipur
lated with reckless disregard of starving peasants in
Europe or impoverished American farmers.

The Senate's investigation even tho it is but a slight
step, measures some progress toward economic planning.

VERY MUCH ALIVE
(From the Oberlin Review)

About two years ago the older generation used to
explain to us that modern popular music was but a [at]
and that it would soon die out. Since we did not believe
that new short songs could be written from now until
doom's day, we very naively agreed. Surely composers
will use up all their ideas in a short timc, we thought,

Now we begin to wonder .....

Every month or so we tell ourselves that the latest
pieces are the most beautiful We have ever heard. Clari~
hetists squeak together in perfect harmony; cornctists.
by rapid tongueing, go up, down, and around the scale,
]lraviding' that; certain needed element called “1381);” vice
linists slide dreomily from one note to another during a.
slow Waltz; and even the cboeist, with a. frog in his
throat, finds a popularity he has never known before.

Some songs we admit: ore feeble attempts to mnko
rhyme, but even the words have difficulty in destroying
the beauty of a melody for us. After all, we can get
around them by humming!

Were anyone to a. - us now, we Should no longer
claim that popular music will die out. Perhaps it may
fade in the eyes of some members of the older generar
Lionihut for the younger generation. as long as there
is dancing, so long will there be popular music.
