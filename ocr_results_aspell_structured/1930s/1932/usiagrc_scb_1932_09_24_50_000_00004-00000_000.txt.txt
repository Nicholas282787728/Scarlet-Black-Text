Bear Squad

Looks Good

Washington to Try Valley

Comeback This Year

ST. LOUIS, Mo. (SpecianiAttel'
two weeks of strenuous practices at
tho rate of two sessions a day, Coach
Jimmy Conzelman has developcd a
football squad at Washington will-
veisity that will put up the strongest
comeback fight for conference lead-
ership in the football history of the
Bears.

Without the choice of material and
without sufficient spring practice
time to give but the mdiments of the
new system he is installing, Conzelr
man has discovered a strong line and
a backfield capable of executing
shifts and plays with exact precision.
The first practice scrimmage was
held Saturday.

Bears Disciplined

Before four days of fall practice
had passed last week the new dici-
plinary control of Conzelinan was
evidenced by the dismissal of two
varsity players, Steinecker, a center.
and Landwirth, an end. Both had
missed three practices without ox-
euse.

"We’re going to have discipline on
the team this year." Conzelmnn said
in explanation. “When I call practice
I want every man to report. There
are too many willing players on hand
to bother about those who are “nine
terested."

Fight for Positions

Individual members of the squad
are fighting for positionSAsomething
new in the Bear camp. There are
capable substitutes for every first
team man, and Conzelman has not-
assigned a position to any one man
for the season. Ability. sufficient
fight and interest in the game are
what will determine positions for

every member of the first team.
Conzclman expects to use as many
as four different teams in his early

he has enough material to substitute
frmiy.

The Washington university squad
:now numbers fol'tyeeight, including
eighteen letterlnen and ten men from
last year's freshman team. This is
one of the lzll'gcst squads the Bears
have had in a number of years. A
freshman squad of about sixty-five is
expected this Week when freshman
training begins.

In the backfield, Conzelman is pres
senting‘ this season a triple-threat
man in Leonard Bush, ISDrpound
punter, blocker, and pass receiver.
‘Bush began his college football at
iDrul'y college in Springfield, Mo. With
Bush will be Max Tyrrell, experienced
signal caller, who is St letterman.

12 Hulfbacks

For fllllbacks, the new Bear men~
tor "has Harvey Miller. captain of the
team. Ed Fl'edrickson, S. P. Shakof—
sky, John Mavrakos, and William Mc-
Crackin. TWBlve halfbacks are being
trained for this position, while there
are eight men in line for guard posi-
tion, seven for tackle, twelve for end,
and three in ct: ’ r.

Picking likely prospects for each
of the ll cogs in a football machine
is made difficult by the large num—
ber of contenders for squad berths;
but Coach Waldorf and his assistants
hope to have at least a temporary
combination picked before the open-
ing double header here Friday, when
Central Teachers and phillips U. will
be met in succession the same night.

Large squads are an advantage in
the long run, however. Waldorf in-

Early season predictions about Dick
Ullrich seemed to turn out well, if
his perfornnince last night was any
indication of what he will do for the
rest of the .scoson. Despite the fact
that he was Gﬁlmell’s lending grounds
gainer, he is not a flashy man in op-
eii field. His powerful legs carry him
through the line for 10 and 15 yards
at a time which makes for a consist-
aiit shaping.
