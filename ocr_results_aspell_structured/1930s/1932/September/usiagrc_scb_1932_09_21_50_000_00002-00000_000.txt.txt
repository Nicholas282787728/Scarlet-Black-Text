TO OUR NEW RECRUITS, GREETINGS!

It is now ciglltyrfollr years since tllis College
began its work. with one Professor and two Fresh-
men. The infant college of that day has long since
grown to maturity and on honored place among
Aillericcn institutions. There are six thousand soils
and daughters of Gl'illllell scattered over the face
of the earth, a great proportion of them leaders
ill their communities and making definite and ML
liable contribution to the development of our civ-
ilization. You are now beginning your enlistment
ill tll llrmy of educated men and women who got
tllcir preparation and formed their ideals :lt Grills
llell. We welcome you to this goodly fellowship. All
that we hiwe and are is fit your service, ill order

that you ill turn may become serviceable as lvell'

as efficient citizens of the Great Community. If
you have come to a difficult hour in the history of
the world and of ollr country, that is all‘ the more
reason for strenuous efforts to prepare yourselves
for the solving of hard problems and the decomp-
lishment of severe tasks. You will find more joy
ill such accomplishment than in any kind of mater-
ial success. Ill the year of opportunity that lies
before you, “gird up the loills of your mint ” so
that you may be swift to enter into the larger re-
sponsibility that is surely awaiting yoll. The old
motto “Per aspcra ad astra” is a good one for
these days. Many Grinnelliolls have found that
day. May you follow in their train!

TO THE MAN IN THE STANDS

Friday night marks the start of another Pio-
neer grid season. Whether or not it will mean the
beginning of an unbroken string of victoriesino
one can tell.

Coach L. L. Watt, and Duke, and the return-
ing letternlen, Gruflulld. U'llrich, Duncan, Rosc,
Gould, Martin, McKee, Roscnblooln, Luke, James,
and Figlalld, backed by fast developing Sopho-
mores and reserves, will go a long Way toward
giving us a winning team. This is not directed to
ward them.

Grillnell has only four games at home this
year, but in those four games, and every other
game we can possibly get to, it is up to us to show
the team we are really behind llel‘ithflt there
really is something worth fighting for.

Get the “Grilnlell Spirit” now. It’s czlsy
enough to yell and stamp your feet—when Grinncll
is in the lead. But to keep that noise going when
Grinnell is behindithdt’s the thing!

Only 11 men can fight for Grinncll at a time,
on the field, but the whole student body can, and
should, fight fol“ Grillnell on the sidelines.

THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

GIVE THE CLASS OF '32 A CHANGE
(The Creightoruan)

Ever since the class of 1932 was graduated from
America's universities in June. a thousand and one
kno\ alls are having the times of their lives razzing
American education because thus far nothing has been
done to turn the world around into prosperity. The class
of '32 was expected to jump from the classroom into
a world upset by unprecedented depression and with a
few all-powerful words from an economic text book,
set the world right. The members of that class never
for one minute made themselves believe that they alone
held the power to create prosperity. They do believe,
homver, that given the chance they will put their
learning to use and in the course of time will be able
to prove that their education was not for nothing.

For the most part, the graduates of the class of
'32 are in no position to make use of the technical edu-
cation they received. The big business of a few years
ago isn’t big enough to realize that in the class of ’32
and those to follow in the next mw years lies the solu-
tion to better times. There are thousands of graduates,
each one of whom is better able to do the work that
today is being done by those who are incapable. They
have spent years studying the workings of business
and, above all, they have been trained in the ways of
fair dealing had honesty. It is the absence of all semb-
lance of ethics in all lines of endeavor which has thrown
the world into a boiling mass of confusion. It is the
absence of all moral law that causes thousands to go
hungry while warehouses and grain elevators hold
rotting masses of food. .

Big business, show that you are big enough and
smart enough to lmow when you are getting a bargain.
"the American class of '32 is on the bargain table. A:
no time in history could such well trained persons be
made a part of a. concern for so little. Take them in and
give them an opportunity to show what they can do
to put America on its feet. Don’t condemn the educa-
tional system and the youth of America before it has
been given a chance to prove itself: 'And don't expect
it to pull America from the rut in a day. It took ten
years to get there. It may take that long to get out. But
the class of ’32 will pull it out. All that it needs is the
chance.

THE CHALLENGE’OF A WORLD IN

TRANSITION
(Coo College Cosmos)

Despite the financial burdens which the “depression”
has inflicted on students and institutions alike, the
coming college year bids fair to be one of the most ine
terestihg in the history of the college. The freshman
entering college for the first time, if he is at all cons
cious of the conditions in the world today, can not be
all together sure that his enrollment in a college is
quite worth while, He cannot but reflect upon the con-
dition of unemployment existing among the thousands
of graduates of last year. He cannot but witness the
exigencies of a rapidly changing world. He sees uncer»
tainty where once was stability. Lt he thinks about the
society in any terms at all, he cannot fail but to be
muddled and discouraged.

The educated man of a few years ago was assured of
his niche in society. Such assurance nowadays would
seem extremely doubtful, if not a little blatant. He sees
the call for specialized training in industry and science,
and then sees the specialist cast away when his services
are found to be unprofitable. He is not sure whether
he can educate himself for the needs of the future so—
ciety, for he is not at all convinced just what that so-
ciety is going to be.

This condition, however, is not so discouraging. It
is indeed fortunate for the student that he will be able
to view as a trained observer the world in transition.
The phenomenon which the scientists call “change" is
strikingly pictured in our society today. The economic
basis of society is transforming before his very eyes.
A new interpretation» of economic behavior is at hand.
The morals and general thought of a civilization are
experiencing a similar metamorphosis. Thus, the stu-
dent unencumbered with the duties of society, is well
able to observe our culture in revolution.

Such change and such uncertainty should produce
a new type of student, Not the cynical and bizarre type
of the decade of ultrasmartness, but a sincere, earnest
type, trained to be critical, without a demoting skepti»
cism. A student who will rebound to uncertainty of our
system, with a resolution for greater scholastic effort.
A student who realizes that, to make himself fit for
participation in future society, will necessitate study,
perseverance, better mental equipment and the ability
to meet keener competition.

This is the challenge to the class of '36—the chal-
lenge of a changn'ng world.
