Lack of small slices is the major
hindrance to having more fresh suit—
ed up. Vance Posey, athletic depart-
ment business manager. ran out of
sixes, six and a halts, and sevens the
first day the freshmen got suits.

That looked like a squad as small
in size as it is big in numbers; but
the coaches who looked the hoys over
say they are plenty big. Maybe that
means a fast Aggie team in coming
years, if anyone insists on making it
the oasis of prognosticstions.

Outstanding Yettrlillgs

Among the yearlings in the Aggie
camp arc Bud Key, Hennessey, an
all-state guard in high school; James
"Germany” Schneider, who was
among the state's best' high school

at least 20 pounds more than Boss’s
200; Tom Hanley, Enid, another
heavyweight scaling 215 pounds, and
state champion high school wrestler

present varsity and on allrstate men.

At least a dozen more equally good,

valid probably some of them better,

will be uncovered out or the remain

Coach Harald “Fully” James' system
works as well as it has in past years.
