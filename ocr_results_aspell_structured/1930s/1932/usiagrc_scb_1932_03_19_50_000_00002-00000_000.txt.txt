BE YOURSELF
(Tram 19.x hitllge)

AS the trend toward colicgc education for all bc-
coiucs more and more popular, students Strive to become
sciucihlug thcy urc not, A college education they feel

oulu mokc thcm sophi, ticolcd, radical, apart from the
"tall. hurl in the pursuancc of that cud. they cover them-
sclrcs with a. veneer of artrfrcrallty that completely di,
guises their true pcrsonnlity.

They speak knowingly of the necessity for hﬂvmg a
philosophy of life, the oftcn they have not even tho
romotost Itlezt of what such a thing is. They assume
mannerisms on the grounds that they arc individualists.
They accept lcachings as they come, on the grounds that
to dispute them would betray iguomncc; or else they cuss
putc thcm because they feel that they are radical. The
whole upshot is, that many college graduates become so
cloaked with artificiality that upon their entrance into
the world, they have as much personality as a goldfish.

Perhaps the whole horrible mistake lies in the fact
that few students realize that development of the indi-
vidnal personality or the cultivation of their present vir-
tues, is far more important than the attainment of some
willsolthe-wlsp trait that happens to be “Smart." or finds
favor in the public eye for the moment. Every human
being possesses somc inherent good and it is up to the
indIVIdual to oliscovcr and develop it. In the quest for
a philosophy of lifc, students are too prone to bury thcir
talent in artificiality instead of showing it to advantage.

Artificiality is the bane of the college youth and the
best antidote for it is the slogan, “Be yourself!” To be
one's self means to be natural: to accept new ideas if
they seem plausible, to reject them if unsound even
tho they seem colorful; to accept things as they coinc
and make the best of them: to be frank tho not bar»
castic; to have the courage to change an opinion if it
be found wanting: to stand up for rights; to let modera-
tion govern all action. To be sure these are not all in-
clusivo but they arc complete enough for u start. The
individual must sock out his own virtues and develop
them. But above all, let him forget such things as n
philosophy of life. Let him obsci-vc “Be yourself" and
before he knows it, he will possess a gcnuino philosophy
of lifeia philosophy that is not obscured by the veil of
ortificiality.

COLLEGE INFANCY
(Fram The Purdue Exponent)

Charging that the present. educational System pro-
lcngs infancy in college students and does not prepare
the students for the responsibilities of real life, Dr. Hots
ace M. Kailen, psychologist, philosopher and author, told
a group of students and facility Thursday night at the
University of Illinois that the American college takes a
physiological adult individual and keeps him in a cons
rhtion of social infancy until graduation. He maintained
that college students are not charged with the social
problems of an adult.

“Physiologically a student reaches maturity at puber-
ty. but the educational system of the college is so (Lona
structed that it keeps the students from reaching social
maturity until after they have graduated from the instlr
tution, thereby causing a long gap between physical and
social adulthood," he said. “In times of war we recognize
adulthood at about the age of 18, cwrc maturity is arb
ti-arlly set at 21."

There is undoubtedly some Lilith in Dr. Kallen's ac—
cusations. The social maturity of the collegc student
must necessarily be somewhat retarded because of hi
dependence, in most cases, on some Source or support
other than his own if he were thrown face to face with
all the social problems of adult life. earning a living.
holding his job, etc, he would have no timc left in which
to attend classes.

Young people coming from the poorer classes reach
what Dr. Knilcn calls social maturity at an age much
ncarcr physical maturity than do college students, be-
cause they are generally thrown on their own resources
early in life and have to face by themselves problems
which often do not affect the college student, This
doesn't necessarily mean they have any advantage over
the college man or woman. They may have an earlier
and broader experience along certain lincs, and be better
prepared to grapple with ccrtam forms of social prob-
lems, but surcly the college student must have acquired
in his four years at school many experiences and a deal
of information which will be of material as ' tauce to
him the moment he is thrown on his own resources. Even
if the average college student is Shielded behind a front
of parental financial support, the variety and complexity
of the problems which he faces daily and his experience
in their solution tends to narrow the gap between physics
at and social adulthood.

SNAPPING AT THE MIGHTY
(From The Dc Paulin)

Ouc is led to.beiicvc from books that have rcccntly
been published that America had an insatiable appetite
for gossip. We refer to such literary efforts as “The
Strange Career of Herbert Hoover Under Two Flags,"
which was in all probability written to duplicate the ful-
ancial success of its predecessor, “The Strange Death of
President Harding."

The public demand for this type of reading is a sad
commentary on not only our respect for and fftith in
men in high places, but also on our morbid curiosity.
Perhaps-those who foil and nurse grievances get some
degree of satisfaction from learning that the men at the
top are not perfect in every rcspoct. If thcsc books were
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, they would
serve both as informative and hostorical documents. But
they are for thc most par-t unfounded in fact. They per-
vcrt the truth until it is a gasping revelation

It is iutcrostrng to note that not one president has
been free from this cowardly attack. In the case of
President Wilson, the whispcrings wore unprintablc. Mr.
Wilson was unable to find anyone who would make the
accusations to his face and in the open. He took clcvor
stops by providing a way to stamp out the ugly rumors
if they rcorcd their heads after his death. To purchase
these books, or to make a demand for them in any way,
i. a cowardly and unpatriotic act. We need not bc
afraid that we shall miss anything important by not
reading these books. If there really is anything Serious
against a man, rest assured that it will be dug up by his
political opponents before he is elected.
