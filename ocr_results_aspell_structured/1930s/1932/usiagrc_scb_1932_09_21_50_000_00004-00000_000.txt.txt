When the 1932 edition of the Grin—

field Friday night against Penn, it
will be attempting to maintain a
th'eeryeal' undefeated record on the
home gridiron. Not since 1925 have
the Pioneers dropped a game on
Ward field. The last defeat was in—
flicted by Creighton 20-19 four years
ago.
x< v a
Creighton wiil have on opportun-
ity to end the streak this year, since
they provide the homecoming attrac-
tion hem Armistice Day. But the
Pioneers have proved that they are
hard to beat on their home field, and
:in addition, will be out to revenge
the 8-0 defeat of lost season admin-
ntered by the Bluejays ‘on a mine
soaked Omaha gridiron.

The third game on the Grinnell
schedule will see Coach Watt’s men
opposing the powerful Michigan state
team. For the past three seasons. the
Pioneers have been bothered hy a one—
game hoodoo, always meeting one
outstanding team and each time tak»
ing the short end of the count.
is s a
Three years ago it was Iowa state,
the Cyclones winning 26-7. ‘1\vo
years ago it was the Detroit U. ma»
chine that crushed n light Grillnoll
team 47-6. Last year it was the st.
Louis U. steamroller that druhbod
the Pioneers, 4376.

There may he a psychological ex-

 

ncll college football team takes the ,

plantation of this peculiar state of at»
fairs, for each year the team has en-
joyed unusual success in the rest of
their games. It seems, though, that
before. the squad has gone into the
game with the feeling that they were
up against an unbeatable team, and
consequently were beaten.
.. 2 a

There is none of ﬁlis pessimism in
the Pioneer camp at the present
time, however. on (‘hc contrary, the
men are already keyed to it high
pitch, and if this pitch coupe mum-l
milled there is likely to be all upsccl
in the pro-game dope on the Michi-
ghn State contest.

Although the ISO-pound phenom of
the 1931 team, Hank Thomas, will be
sorely missed, his loss may be offset
by the new esprit dc corps of the
squad and by the fact that each man
will have L0 be battling all the time
in order to hold his position. The
‘great increase in reserve strength is
a blessing to Coach Watt in more
ways than one.
, . r; s

And Captain Gmﬂmld, who incl-
deumlly was the mt defensive full-
back in the conference last year, is
the type of captain that Grimm“ has
needed [or some time. Ho should
keep the team working in perfect
harmony from his position hack of
the line, in addition to bani-lg the
brunt of the defensive work.

. . . the wildest cigarette
you ever smoked

E buy the ﬁnest, the very

ﬁnest tobaccos in all the
world—but that does not
explain why folks every
where regard Lucky Strike as
the mildest cigarette. The fact
is, we never overlook the
truth that “Nature in the
Raw is Seldom Mild”—so

in cigarettes-

these fine tobaccos, after
proper aging and mellowing,
are then given the beneﬁt of
that Lucky Strike purifying
process, described by the
words—“It‘s toasted”. That’s
why folks in every city, town
and hamlet say that Luckics
are such mild cigarettes.
