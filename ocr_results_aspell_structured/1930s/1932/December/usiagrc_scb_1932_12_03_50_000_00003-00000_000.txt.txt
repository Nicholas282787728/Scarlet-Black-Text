.Mrs. Ellis Turned Down

Chance to Come Here

on Titantc

“My father died when I was nine
and 1 went to work in a printer's of-
fice for 50 cents an hour to help my
mother support the family," said
Mrs. Louise Ellis, caretaker of Rand
gymnasium and the swimming pool,
in an interview with a Scarlet and
Black reporter yesterday.

She was telling of her early life
in Manchester, England, ‘the place of
'her birth.

Worked in cotton luill
“I worked from eight in the morn-
ing till seven at night, with an hour
' off for dinner," said Mrs. Ellis, and
went on to tell about her later work
in a cotton mill, where she worked
for 14 years, in the room in which
cotton i's broken from the bales.

After that, she was janitress in
a large Episcopal grade school which
accommodated 900 scholars daily.

According to Mrs. Ellis, there were
several reasons why she came from
England to the United States. Ever
since she had been a girl of lo, she

GRINNELL‘S OUTSTANDING GIET‘

had wanted to come to the States.

When a neighbor of here come to
Grinnell and wrote glowing accounts
back to England, Mrs. Ellls' only
daughter (now Mrs. Elmer Zunwalt
of Grinncli) made up her mind that
she also wanted to come over, and
the entire family decided to come.

Coal Strike Decides
Another deciding motive was the
great coal strike, then in force,
which was so severe that more than
20 pounds of coal could not be ob-
tained, even for invalids.

In connection with the actual
crossing, Mrs. Ellis is thankful for
a superstition of hers. She had been
disappointed twice about the boat
she was to sail on, and when she had
a chance to sail on the Titanic, she
refused, because it was not a sure
offer. and she believed it to be bad
luck to be disappointed three times
running.

That was the first and last trip
for the Titanic. Mrs. Ellis‘ superstr
tion had saved her from being “food
for fishes."

The family arrived in Grinnell 21
years ago last April and has lived
here ever since. Mrs. Ellis has been
working for the college six years.
Her husband was employed here prior
to his death three years ago.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Truesdale Changes
Pioneer Strategy

.
(Continued from Pagc Oriel
in working the ball down the ﬂoor,
Coach Truesdalc can insert Lawrence
Kayscr, another sophomore, who IS
a promising offensive player.
New Type Offense

Pionccr basketball fans will see a
new type of offense used by the scar-
let and black team this year, because
of changes in the rules. A new law
prohibits thc ball from being held in
thc backcourt longer than ten sec-
onds, and forbids its return once it
has passed the center line. Conse—
quently, it will be difficult to use
many of Trucsdale's favorite set
plays, which rely on skillful balle
handling and phychological domina»
tion of the opponents, putting the
ball in a certain spot at a certain
time.

Because of this system used in
past years, Grinnell teams never ran
up high scores. although seldom did
they fail to score between 20 and
30 points. This year, with added
speed and height, the Pioneer team
will probably concentrate on a fast-
breaking, Smoothrpassing attack, In
all probability higher scores will be
run up, but it is a matter of canjec»
ture whether or not the team will
win more games than it has in past
years.

Nine Six-Footers

With McCrcary, Frye, and Rowe
missing from last year's lineup, the
air-tight defense which has charac-
terized Crinnell play in recent years
will rely on the ability of the new
men to fit into the ‘system. This
year coach Truesdale will find that
the increased height of the squad
will enable him to control the ball
off the backboard, an essential part
of defensive playing, so’the loss of
these players may not be so keenly
felt.

Nine men on the squad are over
Six feet tall, Ullrich being the only
one of the men likely to start the
Minnesota game who does not reach
the six foot mark.

Intense practice sessions are in
order for the team next week for
the first three days, at least.

(sﬂccml lo Tllc Starla! and Black)
DES M01NES, IOWA~Niue vic-
tories, two has and but a single loss
is the record of the pawerfur Okla-
homa A. S: M. football team which
recently concluded its strenuous Sea-
son as Missouri Valley conference
and Oklahoma state champion.

The Cowboys, led by the rampant
“Plowboy” l-lall, plunging fullback,
piled up 178 points to their oppon-
ents’ 57 to lead the conference both
offensively and defensivcly.

The lone loss was at the hands of
Jefferson university of Dallas, Tex.,
12 to 6. Central held the Oklaho-
mans to a scoreless deadlock in the
opening double-header. Tulsa uni~
vcrsity also succeeded in gaining a
scoreless tie with the Missouri Vale
ley team.

Creighton, with five victories, two
defeats and a tie with Marquette,
ranked second among valley school .
In nonconference opposition val-
ley teams won 16, lost 12 and tied
four, ringing up a.winning percent-
age of approximately 600. Against
Big Six opposition teams of the Mic-
souri Valley conference again had
the edge, taking two out of three en-
gagements.

Oklahoma A. & M. grabbed a bit-
terly fought game from Oklahoma
university, 7 to 0, while Washington
tripped the University of Missouri,
14 to 6. Iowa State of the Big six
broke Drake's string of four straight
by handing the luckiess Bulldogs a
34 to 13 trimming.

of musicianship, or lack of depth, rc-
vcals itself, Mme, Cradova held her
audience almost breathless as she
buried the mighty reverberations of
the toccata and fugue back and forth
among the tonal massifs of the over-
whelming structure; but in the lovely
adagio, and the chorale-prelude, she
secmed like Joan of Arc listening to
the Voices.

In every style of music she was
equally at home, but into everything
that she played, from the most ven-
erable classic to the most bizarre
modern, she put something new,
something original, some evidence of
a powerful personality, and that is
why I believe that we heard a new
voice in piano playing, and that is
why I felt it to be so astonishing an
event.
