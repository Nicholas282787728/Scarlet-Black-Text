Cagers Prepare for Metho

 

Probation Day
Saturday Will
Replace ‘Hell’

Revised Plan One of Six
Branches of Fresh

‘Prepping’

Probation day. the substitute for
the traditional “hell week” arranged
by the Council of House Presidents in
accordance with its revised plan for
prepping, will be in force for the day
and the night of next Saturday.

Paddling will no longer be a part
of the probation period, but otherwise
all the old devices'for making the
freshmen uncomfortable are likely to
be in evidence.

Revised Plan

A revised plan for prepping was
announced several weeks ago by the
council, furnishing a means of uni-
form procedure in this matter in all
the men‘s dormitories. The plan
states seven definite purposes of
prepping, names six specific branches
of which prepping is to consist, and
makes definite provision for its en-
forcement.

Probation day constitutes one of
the six branches of prepping, and is
to be held one day and one night of
each semester, The other branches
include a system of upperclass spon-
sors, a course in etiquette, menial
duties, observance of rules, and lnle
tiation into the hall.

Purposes of Prepping

The purposes of prepping, as given
in the plan, have, as their end, the
enabling of the freshmen to get the
most they can out of college, and to
function as more efficient units of
their individual halls'. ’ “

Enforcement of prepping is to be
accomplished by the advisory board
of the hall, and, if necessary, by can-
cellation of privileges. Paddling is to
be looked upon as extremely dis-
graceful, and is to be used only in
extreme cases, and then only at the
discretion of the advisorey board, and
by the members of the board. In
severe cases. a freshman may be ex-
pelled from his hall.

The Council of House Presidents
may amend the present plan at any
time they see fit, with the approval
of the college administration.

‘Rhapsody In Blue’ H
for American

Central Theme ‘Belautiful'
But Filled With Too
Much ‘Paltel"

“George Gershwin-s ‘Rhapsody in
Blue' displays potentialities for a
distinctly American music," recently
stated Chester W. Williams, instruc»
tor in wind instruments.
Mr, Williams explained that it is
beautiful and original but the entire
composition is filled in with too much
"patter."
Too Much Patter

“That has been the fault of our
modern compositions," he added, “Al-
though some good things have been
produced, most American music (as
produced by Gershwin and contempor-.
aries) contains too much patter.',
Without some depth a selection will
not last long.”
He believes that, as yet. there is no
truly American music. in his opinion ‘
about the only music that honestly
could be called American is that of
the lndians and we today know al-

'1ndianapolis of the Aggies

as Potentialil‘ties
Music Says Williams

most nothing about it.

Ml: Williams talked of modern mu-
sic and the possibility of its becoming
typically American, “It is extremely
simple in form but it is distinctly
American. However, little of it can
be called really good for too much
emphasis has been placed upon over»
tones and instrumental arrangements.
To become a national music it must
have a characteristic theme that has
been generally neglected.

Europeans Can’t. Play it

“When American dance music made
its debut in foreign countries it was
played by European orchestras To
Americans and foreigners alike it
sounded terrible. Later American or
chestras were brought to these coun—
tries by popular dcmand of American
tourists and they oriented foreign
musicians to the essence of arrange-
ment."

“Since then this modern dance mu-
sic has increased its popular approval
but it is still far from the ultimate
goal; that of becoming truly Ameri—
can music and representative of
American llfe,". he concluded.

it is his conviction that many of
our newer selections might have
beautiful themes but they are played
so frequently and by orchestras vary-
ing so greatly in quality and style
that they are soon disc’arded and for-
gotten. This makes the struggle to
vest them as representative Amerir
can music exceedingly difficult.

An experiment in the development
of an American music in a summer
camp in New England founded by
Edward MaoDoweli, former Ameri-
can pianist and composer whose art
is representative of the best music
that America has produced, and con-
tinued by his wife. It is for students
to study and work out original com-
positions.

Grinnell Debaters Meet
Nebraska Here Today

“Resolved, that Congress should
enact legislation providing for feder-
al regulation of electric power utili~
ties," was the question used by the
University of Nebraska and Grinnell
in a non-decision debate in the Grirp
nell high school auditorium at 1
o'clock this afternoon.

The team from Nebraska. Donald
Shirley and John Wilson, took the
negative and Dave Singer and Jack
Maxfield upheld the affirmative for
Grinnell. Bob Adams, president of
Forensic, acted as chairman.

Grinnell Coach
F lays Aggies

‘One-Year Football Record
Causes Swelled HeadY

A news Story and editorial in the
Daily O'Collegian, Oklahoma A. Kc.
M. student newspaper, which claim
that other Missouri Valley schools
are not in the same class athletically
with the Aggies. have drawn comment
from Coach J. C. Truesdale. Grinnell
college athletic director.

in discussing the proposal joining
of the Big Six conference by the Ok—
lahoma Aggics. the Daily O'Collegiau
claims that in the Missouri Valley,
“the schools are small, most of the
teams are weak,” and that “We are
one of the few M. v. teams which are
not push~overs for any good team,"

In commenting on this Coach
’I‘rue‘sdalc says: “The Aggies had a
wonderful football team this fall7
probably the best the Valley has seen
for years. However. this is certainly
no basis for claiming sustained Sue
periority in all sports.

“In basketball, track and swim-
ming, the Aggies are not superior to
other Missouri Valley teams. One
year’s football record should not give
a school a swelled-head."

No mention was made at the recent
Missouri Valely directory meeting in
joining
the Big Six, Coach Truesdale said.

Pioneers—Play
First Home
Game Friday

Truesdale Expects Improved
Work in Simpson

Encounter

By MAX ROSS
(Sports Editor)

Local basketball followers will get
their first opportunity to see the
1932-33 Grinnell college quintet in
action, when the Pioneers oppose
Simpson college of indiahola Friday
afternoon in the men's gymnasium.

A demonstration of new basketball
rules, at 4:30, in which the Grinnell
and Simpson teams will participate,
will precede the regular game.

Second Pioneer Genie

It will be the second game of the
season for Coach Trllesdale's charges.
who lost to Minnesota last weekend
by a rather onesided score of 55 to
25. Coach Truesdale is far from pesai-
mististic, however, and expects his
sophomores to develop rapidly.

The greatest defect in the Pio-
neers' exhibition of basketball at
Minneapolis was a weak defense. The
sophomores were overranxious for the
most part, and the smooth-working
Gopher attack slipped through many
times for easy shots.

Gophers Out classed Grinnell

Minnesota, with one of its strong-
est teams in history, did not provide
a good test for the green Grinnell
team. Simpson is more in the same
class with the home team, and the
game should give an indication of
how the Pioneers will rank in their
own section of the country. it is
probable that the starting lineup will
be the same as that at Minneapolis:
Captain Duncan and Mason, forwards;
Phelps, center; Ullrich and Santi,
guards.

Anderson Returns

Anderson, lanky sophomore center,
returned to the squad early this week,
and may see action Friday. The fight
for the other guard post on the team
is becoming more intense, with Mor-
gan. Manna. McCully, Kayser, and
McMiilin pushing Santi for the as-
signment.

Grinnell Loses

To Minnesota

The crack University of Minnesota
quintet went on a scoring rampage
last Saturday night to down an inex<
perienced Grinnell college team. 55-
25, in the Minnesota fieldhouse.

The game turned into a rout after
the first 10 minutes and the Gophers
acquired a 27 to 9 lead at the end of
the first half. With the first team
playing virtually the entire game, the
Minneapolis team counted 28 more
points, while Coach Truesdale's men
scored 15.

For the first few minutes, the
Pioneers showed signs of activity.
and at one time were lending is to 5.
But their advantage was short-lived.
Robinson, Wright, Licht, and Ander-
son were the main cogs in the Gopher
offense. while Captain Duncan, Ma-
son, and Ullrich played best for Grin-
nell. Duncan was the leading Pioneer
scorer with two field goals and five
free throws.
