HERE are entirely different kinds of lolsaow.

Blend them and you get a diﬁ‘erem taste.

Cross-Blend them and you gel in better tastes

While blending mixes the lobacoos together, Cross-Blending "welds” and
"joins" lheil- ﬂavors into one.

Imagine doing this with the world’s finest cigarette tobaccos—mnny kinds
of Bright tobacco, at great many types of Burley tobacco and numerous
grades of Turkish lobnocol

What you have when you’ve finished is Chesterﬁeld tobacco—better than
any one kind, better than a blend of all kinds—really a new kind of tobacco
ﬂavor tlmt’s milder, more fragrant and a whole lot more pleasing lo the taste.
