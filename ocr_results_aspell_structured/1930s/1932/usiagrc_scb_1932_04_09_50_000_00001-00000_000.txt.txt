A trio of veterans, all lettermen,
will form a nucleus for the 1932 var»

are Frank Davis, Des Moincs; Don

Bad weather has handicapped the
batman so far, since it has not been
possible to get the courts in shape
for active use. Workouts have been
confined to the women's courts and
to the gymnasium.

Despite a general reduction of ex-
penditures, an attempt will be made
to schedule meets with Drake, Iowa
state. One, and University of Iowa.
playing two meets with each of these
schools except Iowa State. If arrange-
ments can be made, the Pioneers will
probably open the season at Ames on
April lo, since the Cyclones have
several concrete courts available for
use. The annual Missouri Valley con-
ference meet is scheduled for May
21 at Omaha.

, Need of War

Speaker Scores Armaments
This Afternoon

l "I don’t believe in disarmnincnt if
war is necessary and dcsll‘ableiinr
‘evitableiand if armaments are an
,nssurance of peace." This was Stod-
dard Lane's opening statement in an
‘atldress to international peace Coh—

ferencc delegates this afternoon. “But,

s war desirable, ncccsscry, inevitable
fund do armaments give air assurance
of peace?"
i Some claim, the speaker said, that
‘there is a biological necessity for
war, That without war we would
'stagnatc. That war is a. pruning hook
ind so the pacifists err in thinking
Ipeace desirable
V, "others say," he continued, “that
ll’v’ar is a part of life. Famous niilie
jtarists say that no one wants war,
lbiit on the other hand, no one wants
hurricanes and what can be done
‘labout it?
“Ones attitude of mind makes the
.difference and that all depends on
lane’s philosophy. If military philosoc
phy is true, disarmament is unneces-
sary, undesirable and impossible.
“But,” he asked, “is war desirable
and necessary? Look at the ecu»
nomic condition of the world, the fin—
lancial loss experienced, and the bio
llogical result, and the moral side.
"Nothing wrong is inevitable. Noth.
ing right is impossible. Are arma-
ments the surest guarantee of peace?
Certainly not when it is true that
[the discharge of one weapon would
‘likely start the end of civilization."
In closing Mr. Lane pointed out
the difference between Mr. Colflesh
and Mr. Libby. “Colﬂesh is for se-
curity in event of war. Libby for se-
cririty against war. The latter is our
only hope,” he says. "After war starts
it’s too late to do anything.”

Open Forum
Pins Speakers
to Same View
Both FavtI—D—isarmament

Only When Nations
of World Agree

Sclicduled to present opposing
views of disarmament at the open-
ing meeting of the Iowa college con-
ference on international relations in
Herrick chapel here last night, Fred»
crick J. Libby, of the National Coun-
cil for the Prevention of War, and
Robert W. Colflesh, state American
Legion commander. agreed that, if
disarmament is possible internation-
ally, it is the logical means toward
permanent peace.

Both speakers were to talk on
how Nations Obtain Security," but
thcy took differing bases for their
addresses. Libby showed the defects
of the theory of military security,
while colflesh pointed to the necess-
ity of military security until dis»
armament is placed on an inter--
national plane.

Agree Under Questioning

Their agreement on international
disarmament came under the pres—
sure of definite questioning in the
open forum discussion which follow»
ed the meeting. When questioned as
to just how far he would reduce
armaments in the United States,
Libby confessed that it will be vir-
tually impossible to get any effective
reduction until it is agreed upon by
other nations as well.

Libby, the first speaker, opened his
address by railing against the main-
tenance of antiquated army units,
such as the cavalry, and useless
branches of defense such as the Citi—
zens Military Training camps and
the Reserve Officers Training corps
as useless expenditures.

Arms Ineffective

He then told of the ineffectiveness
of armaments in providing security.
“The history of the world war proves
the statement of Calvin Coolidge," he
said, "that no nation ever had an
army large enough to insure victory.
Germany. the best armed nation, lost
the wa. There’s a lesson in that.
Competitivc building of armaments
can continue only until a nation be-
comes so powerful thht she is re-
garded as dangerous and other pow-
Crs combine against her.

“When you realize that under mili-
tary theory not more than Six nations
at the most can feel secure, then
you i-ealizc how weal.- the theory is.
Little nations can unite to provide
security through arbitration Since
they cannot be secure thru milie
Larl’Sm.”

Ir Paths

Confidence thc sanctity of
treaties is another method toward
peace, accor 3' to Libby. He pointed
to the clfcctivencss of treaties in
the agreement of 50 nations that
Japan will get nothing not in ac—
cordance wtli international law out
of her invasion of China.

In conclusion he showed two paths.
“We can bc secure against the rest,”
he said, “but that lends inevitably to
war and offers nothing but dispair.
Wo can be secure with the rcst and
if we cannot get security that way
we can never have it."

\ sCoiitiiiue

Colflesh pointed to the world war
as evidence that national imperial-
ism and conflict of economic forces
cause war. He told of the casualties.
and then remarked that while further
bloodshed was incomprehensible.
slaughter and war horrors have con-
tinued thru the last decade.

He pointed to numerous wars and
revolutions and finally came to “the
spectacle of Japan, a signatory of the
Briand-Kcllogg Peace Pact, a mem~
ber of the World Court and the
League of Nations, waging offensive
warfarc against Chinaeconclusive
proof that arbitration as a means of
adjusting international difficulties is
not wholly effective today.”

Quoting from the 1932 World Al-
manac. the speaker showed that the
United States now has ihc smallest
