Coaching Record

(Spatial la The Scarlet and Bluclg)

OMAHA, NEBR 7A record lic-
licvcd to he unequalled in the history
of basketball has been hung up dur-
ing the past year by A, A. Schahing—
er, director of athletics and head
coach of hashethall at Creighton uni-
versity here, who completed 10 years
of service in that capacity for Cr one
ton last week.

'His accomplishments during this
tenth year include the production of
the best court team in the school's
history; the winning of Cl'eighton's
first undisputed Missouri Valley con-
fercnce championship: the presidency
of the National Association of Bas-
ketball Coaches, the highest honor in
the profession. and the presidency of
the Missouri Valley conference.

Ten years ago, after starring in
football, besketb’dll, baseball and
track as a student, and later coaching
three sports successfully at Ottawa
university and Kansas State Teachr
ers' college at Emporia, Schalﬁnger
was appointed director of athletics
and head coach of basketball at
Creighton.

Since that time his teams have
piled up a winning percentage of .722.
one of the best collegiate records -in
the nation; they have won five
championships in the North Central
conference in six years of member-
shi and in four years with the Mise
souri valley loop they have won the
undisputed championship once, the
(JD—championship twice, and have been
runners—op in the remaining year.

His high-scoring combinations have
amassed a total of mare than 6.000
points, limiting opposing teams to
two-thirds of that number. His teams
have won an average of more than
13 games per season, scoring an aver-
age of 31 points per game to 23 for
the opposition.

President Nollen presented Phi
Beta Kappa keys to seven seniors. In

his preparatory speech, he compared,
the process of raising plants to the!

way in which people grow into me-
turity thrn knowledge and edu-
cation.

uEducation," he said, “is a process
of drawing out, Nature is the great

educator. Now nature has finally pro-y

duced a creature which can improve
upon nature.”

“Schools are the nurseries for but
man growth " he added. “When sap-

lings arc rcii v to he sent out for-l
transplanting, they are labeled with‘
a guarantee or trade mark which may .7.-

hc compared to the college diploma
given to the seniors on their depart
hire from school." i

“The Phi Beta Kappa hey i:
special recommendation
unusually good work. hut it is not a
guarantee. It is merely a testimony
that the student's \Volk has hitherto
been of the highest rank, and that
he should be nhle to continue that
work in the world with the same
high standard."
