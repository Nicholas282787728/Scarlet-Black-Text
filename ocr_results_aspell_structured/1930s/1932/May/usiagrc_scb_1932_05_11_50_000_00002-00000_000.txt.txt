WHAT Is EDUCATION?
(From tho Oberlin noiicu-l

Even with the widely varied and somewhat in
volved definitions of education which we have today,
still additional ones appear now and then. Among the
latest is that of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butlc , president
of Columbia university, who defines education as fol»
lows:

“Education is a gradual adjustment to the spiritual
possessions of the race, with a view to realizing one's
own potentialities and to assist in car ying forward that
complex of idcas, nits, and institutions which we can
civilization ,.

“The spiritual possessions may be variously cla
fl :, but they certainly are at least five—fold. The child
is entitled to his scientific inheritance, to his intitutionsal
inheritance, and to his religious inheritance. Without
them all he cannot become a truly educated and truly
civilized man.”

«Altho education, in its various phases, may he
viewed from several different angles, perhaps the ad-
dition of a single aspect to the above definition would
make education better fit individuals for their roles in
the world. Education should prepare men and women
to adjust themselves to their surroundings. This is par-
ticularly true of that branch of education with which col-
leges and universities are concerned,

Surely educated people must be familiar with an in
accord with the spiritual and intellectual possessions of
the race. but they must he more than that. Society, like
industry, is always undergoing an evolutionary process,
presenting for each of as it constantly changing en-
vironment complex. That which we know as truth today
will be either obsolete or untrue tomorrow. The facts
and tools with which the technician and industrialist
work today, which are taught in the modern college
classrooms. will be of little or no use tomorrow. Unless
the student has learned to adjust himself to changed
conditions his sarcalled education will avail him little.

If another defini 'on may be added to the group, let
us suggest that a person seek in a ncducation the ability
to adjust him ‘elf quickly and well to his constantly
changing environment.

RECIPROCITY
(From the Tulane Hullalmoo)

If professors actually knew what. most of the young
collegians in their classes were thinking about while
they enter into serious discussions calculated to blaze
the way for light and learning. we wonder what their
reaction would be.

Many students develop the happy (or unhappy)
facility of appearilig to pay attention when in reality
their thoughts are soaring on non-stop flights from the
Florida gulf coast to the Blue Ridge mountains and
back again. By the time one is a junior or senior he
should have fully developed his ability to seem one
thing and be something else. Else, what has he gained
from his college education? After all, is it not. charac-
teristic of representative bachelors of arts to be ac-
complished make-believers?

Perhaps 75 per cent of the students in the average
classroom indulge in day dreams three-fourths of the
class hour. And yet 75 per cent of these are able to con—
ceal it from their trusting pedagogue. This is not to
say that all university professors are unaware of their
students' inattention. Many of them gradually realize
this. lament it, probably. at first, and then carry on with
a "hererit-iSATakerlt-orrleavevi ' attitude. They do
their best, and if the young disciples of learning do not
care to avail themselves at: hand, why should they
Worry? Aren't they being paid to keep on talking, any
way? Thus, the matter resolves itself into an endur-
ance contest—the student endures the professor as a
necessary evil while he day dreams. and the professor
endures the student With a bleary—eyed expression while
he earns his maintenance.

Who gets the most out of these so-called study
hours, it is hard to say. Probably the students do, for
they can dream their dreams, plan dates with the girl
friends that night. do, in short, a million things, and
still tune in on the professor's lecture program at will;
but the poor professor must keep on talking for the
whole hour. Perhaps professors develop a similar faculty
-that of day dreaming while they are lecturing. It's
only fair that they should.
