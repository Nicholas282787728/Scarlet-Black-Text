According to the Omaha World
Herald, John Tatom, former Grinuell
tennis star and Omaha city champion,
may become that city's f st ping-
pong professional. The F pino star,
who has been squash professional at
the University club, may be installed

The Pioneers have grown extreme-
ly lax in getting personal fouls called
on them in the last Dirac games.
Forty-one fouls have been chalked up
against them, which is an average of
more than thirteen each game.

e x e

Dick Ullricb' has been the chief of~
fender with 14, While Duncan is close
behind with 12. Bobby Waite, sopho-
more forward, had his first foul
called on him Monday night in the
Washington game. Captain McCreary
leads in the number of free throws

made with nine.

sis

Coach Art Schah'lngeryof Creigh-
ton objects to the recent press criti-
cism that the only reason Missouri
lost to the Bluejays, 35-34, was hes
cause of the fouls called on the Mis-
souri spectators for booing. This is
somewhat justified, since these fouls
came shortly after the beginning of
the second 'half, whereas the hard
driving Bluejays, trailing by five
points, tossed in three baskets in
quick succession to win the game in
the final minutes of play.

-To advertise the annual football
game between the University of Don.

the students of the former institution
sent an airplane to drop streamers
and balloons bearing the Denver
school colors on the Miner’s campus.
The latter retaliated by painting the

‘sidewalks and walls around the Den-

ver stadium. To settle the argument
once and for all, the Denver-hes lm-
mediatcly dynamited the Mines em—
blem, and incidentally nearly demol-
ished the city of Golden while doing
