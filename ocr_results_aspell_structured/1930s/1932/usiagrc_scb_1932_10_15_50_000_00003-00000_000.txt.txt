Results of the Malteaser presiden-
tial poll will be announced in lurid
newspaper style in the political issue
of the Melteaser, which will he cir-
culated on Tuesday, according to
stan Hipp, editor.

‘Several political stories and poems
feature the issue. nPolitical Confess-
ions of a Coed" are revealed in poetry
by Marjorie Smith and in picture by
Ellen Hendrixson. Grimell’s own
politicians are featured in this issue,
with Van Nostrand, straley, and
Heywood constituting the first group
of "Grinnellians" drawn by John
Dudley, freshman artist. stcn Hipp
and Dudley collaborated to present
"The Village Quacksmith" in the
frontispiece. “The Race between the
Donkey and the Elephant,” by stan
Hipp, is a classic account of the

presidential campaign. The elephant
’ and the donkey, with their riders, are
depicted by King Park.

Two political murals by Esther
Peck, art tryouter, decorate another
page of political comment by Mehit-
able and Clare Heinlein. Gwennie
James offers a page of coeducational
verse in "Quadrangle Meditations."
Wildcat Winnie is written this month
from the zoology laboratory. A fresh
man's impression of upperclassmen is
naively and frankly expressed by
Betty Chevannes, another tryouter.
The Poetry Page this month includes
on old style ballad by Marjorie Smith
and short verses by staff tryouters.
