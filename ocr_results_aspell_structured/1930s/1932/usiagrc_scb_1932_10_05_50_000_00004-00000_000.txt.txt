pass into the waiting arms of Bah
McKee for the touchdown that un»
leashed the dynamite in the Gi-innell
team.

Linc Improves

The line candidates have not so far
lived up to the expectations of early
season predictors, but they are ape
proaching brilliance. Bob Sutton has
not as yet started a game, but it will
be hard to keep him out of the start-
ing lineups before long. Both he and
Clarke have displayed a coolness un-
der fire which is surprising for first
year competition.

Dick Phelps, another of Coach
Watt's sophomore dependables, has
filled in admirably at both end and
center position. Bob Morgan, a tackle
candidate who ma already seen much
action, lacks only a little more de-
termination. Although weighing but
160 pounds, Bob McMillin has held his
own at center against much heavier
and more experienced opponents.

Michigan State Deleatetl

After winning their season’s opener
by the staggering score of 93 to o.
from Alma, Michigan state sure
fercd a 264) reverse at the hands of
the great Michigan grid machine Sat-
urday. The score, however was not
an indication of her true power, ior
Crowley should have one of the best
teams of his career. The greatest task
for the Pioneers will he the stopping
of co-captains Abe Eliowitz and Bob
Monnett, a pair of hardedrivmg half-
backs.

The main burden of responsibility
will fall upon the shoulders of Dick
Ullrich and Captain Fritz Graﬂund,
who are the big guns on offense and
defense respectively. Both Al Rose
and Snap James played an important
part in the victory over Cornell, and
will probably be in the starting line-
up Saturday afternoon.

Ben Douglas, '31, assistant football
coach at Cornell collcge, Mount

Corncll football team.
