“DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN”

Tile poets are optimists. “Sweet are the uses
of adversity” says the disguised Duke ill As You
Like It; and Cowper sings: “The bud may have a
bitter taste. but sweet will he the flowe ” There
is something ill human llature that justlfies this
optimism. which goes deeper than Pollyalllla’s
wishful fall \thn \Villianl James sought a
pacific substitute for war he thought to find it ill
the enlistment of all youth in the l ' rd and grillly
and 'pelilous occupations of ollr civ lzatioll. What-

' lllal' thilll: of tllc old theory of formal
discipline thlongh difficult o1 distasteful study
there ls no doubt that haldsllip has a pedagogical
laluc and a natulal appeal to healthy minds alld
bodies. The football field is a good symbol of this
solid human fact.

The distresses alld disappointments through
which all the world has been passing for almost
three cars are not such as we should have chosen;
there are too lllally millions of innocent alld help-
less v1ct1ms that u 2 should feel anything but shame
and sol'low at tlleir plight and an ardent desire to
alleviate their suffelings, But since we hale tllis
visitation ue might as ll ell get for oursell es such
education out of it as it affords We can surely
learn that there ale higher \ alues 111 humanity than
the possession of things, or playing with gadgets,
or seeking comfort and luxulle The greatest of
our 111ccipoets,p1,ophets builde1 illiﬁe had little
time or ellclgy for such acquisitixe pursuits and we
owe the best things in our 6 izatioll to their
resolute quest of higher and more permanent

v.alues it is the purpose of the college of liberal
arts to 1"cl ll alld commend these values to the
youth of the lalld and so to contribute to the
further prog ss of the race toward a finer llld a
nobler hulllalli It is in this sense that Grllnlell
welcomes hel sons and daughters to the campus
fol another acadelni lcar Now that the storm
and ea 'tllquake and flre of destructive war wild
speculation and crazy spending are lllelcifully
stiﬂed, there' is a chance for us all to hear alld heed
the till, small mice” of the spi1it calling us to
dedlcate our powers to the realization of the best
we lillolv and hope and low. “Come ye bacl: to old
Glinllell ” to help build the better Glillllell and

the better uorld of the futute.

LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE.

What will the student, who says he cannot
afford to come to college because of the current
economic situation, do if he does not come? Unless
he has steady employment will not his living on
pauses be a tremendous burden to the family‘ If
he waits until the depression lifts before coming to

1932-33 Should See
Larger Enrollment

The depress n means nothing to
the class 0[ 1956, for according to fig-
ures from the Department of Public
Relation, Grinnell will welcome more
new students this September than she
did last year. By July 20, 233 new
students, of whom 30 transfer from
other colleges, had sent. in their cre-
dentiats, and the number will doubt»,
less increase in the tlvo months before
the opening of school. ,

A list of the liev. students follows:

to begin a (cliche caleer ill this period of ecolumic
stl ? Logical lcasoning leads us to the L‘Olnlur
slau that it is not. Lct us examine the l'casolillg
llcrc.
college will not the illt'l't'l'lsc ill prices at that time

if a person must borrou in order to come to
school. that money will have to he paid back when
the value of lnon‘ ' has fallen, as it will with tlle
return of higher pr 1 BLT. i this person waits
and then borrows plane 110 must repay the amount
.t a much h "lit-1' rate later Economists say that

llue of money will fall slowly for three or four

.antl thcll go down more slviftlpr So by

' our imagilul v person will be cutting his
own throat.

Suppose 11 young luau starts to college llllliledir
taking advantage of the low cost of living.
At the end of four 'ears. we can assume that this
cloud of dis stel' will have lifted almost entirely.
Hal-lug a college degree, tllc young man will have
the inside track 011 the “plums”, that is, he will
lie ready to start his life work ill the midst of an
upward trend.

All well and good, Suppose though, that the
young lllan had waited two yeal before starting
to school. By the tiluc‘ he 1‘ shes, most of the
“new” jobs will be taken. True, he will not find
it hard to get a start, but when he starts, where
is the man who had the UH) year advantage on him?
Do you see the point? Why not, then, consider the
future instead of the present? Don’t get left ill the
cold!

It is a paper \\ 1th a purpose. \Ve try to give
the students campus news, authentically, and when

The Scarlet and Black is not. all athletic paper,

The management of The. Scarlet and Black, in

Many Freshmen
to Have Brothers
and Sisters Here

Exactly 19 members of the incom-
ing class will have been preceded at»
ready by approximately 19 brothers
and sisters here at Grinnell, while
exactly 19 more new students will
come who will have the more or less
dubious advantage of having a brotlr
er or sister in school at the present
time.

No attempt has been made to inr
elude the pairs of brothers or sisters
who will start to school together, but
records have been obtained showing
that there will be an unusually large
number of "relatives" on hand Sep-
tember 20.

Another lieud~wmtor 1

Another Trumbull and another Van
Nostrand will make their appears
ances, while there is a possibility
that there will alo be another stra-
ley. ”Killer" Brown, the flaming
haired terror of last year’s freshman
class, will have a brother, Richard,
to keep him company. Instead of one
Trigg, Grinnell will now have two
favorite sons of Great Falls, Mon.
tnna.

Nate strawn, brother of John, is
getting a head start on the rest by
taking work in summer school, but
of course that does not elevate him
out of the freshman class. Lloyd Ad-
kins, brother of Wilma; Don Arnold,
brother of Wiley; Vera Ashbaugh,
Veda’s sister (not a typographical
elrol‘); Ethel Bybee, Lyman's sister;
Doris Crabb, sister of Ruth; Jane
Hackett, sister of Mary; Jack Hat»
field, who claims Don as a relation;
Thelma Huber, sister of Bernard, inr
eidentally a niece of Mr. Wehrhan'
Kathryn Paul, Doris’s sister; Esther
Peek, sister 01' Frances and Kathleen
Peck, sister of Ruth (We hope we
got it sti’aight); Sheldon Walker,
brother of Elizabeth; and Bob Whytc,
who is a brother of Betty Pojman,l
nee Whyte, are all coming to Grin-
nell.

New Students “Carry 011"

David Barr, Ruth Goodenow, Mar-
guerite MeFarlin, Elizabeth Mc-
Millan, Esther Collette, and Roberta
Vance were all graduated in June.

J ust A
Sincere Wish

That you are having

the lllost enjoyable
summer. “c 1001!
forward to your re—
turn.

New students 7 it
will take but a short
time to discover that
JOE’S is the place
where s t 11 d e n t s
gather. Just good old
college friendship.

JOE LARGE

prised to find a more youthful mem-
ber of these some families in school.
Camilla Burrows, '31, will have two
brothers entering in the fall, Parke,
and John, who is transferring from
Amherst college. Then among the
new students who have had brothers
or sisters at Grinnell in years gone
by are: Dorothy Brownhrldge, Rau-
dolph Carlson, Robert Gillespie, Ade-
lin Ridgaway, Gretchen Saam, Jean
Smith, William Taggart, Bertha
West, Ruth Mabel Wollenweber, and
William smelds.

Since the summer is only half gone,
this list wnl no doubt be swelled by
the time school starts.

OFFICIAL NOTlcE

No freshman may have a car while
a resident student of Grinnell. Those
wishing to commute from their home
towns or those whose business re-
quires s ear in order to earn a part
of their expenses, must socurc od-
vance wrltten permission from the
dea not men before bringing a car
to Grinnell 'to keep.

Upperolassrnen must not bring a
car to Grinnell until they have learned
from the dean of men whether they
are eligible to have a car.

Having a car here shall be taken
as proof that the student does not

[need employment or scholastic sid‘

unless the student has arranged with
his dean to have the car for strictly
business uses. otherwise the student
shall not be permitted to have any
kind of student aid on his fees.

Mitchell Dreese, former director of
the personnel department at Grinnell
and now head of the same depart
ment at George Washington unlverslr
ty in Washington, D. c., is the proud
father of a baby boy, Mitchell Joe,
born July 12.

' l
but next fall students may be sur-

Mr. Lud Mrs. Albert Johnson, who
have udeared themselves in the
heartsof all those connected with the
quadrangle, will not be here next
year, snce Mr. Johnson’s health calls
for amuch needed rest. They may
return after a year's absence, how-
ever.
