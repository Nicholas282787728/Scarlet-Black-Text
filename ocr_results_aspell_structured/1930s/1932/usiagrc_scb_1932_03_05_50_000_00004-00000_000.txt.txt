Now that the 1932 basketball sea-
son is over, a checkup of the total
points scored finds Hank Duncan,
all-conference forward, leading the
Pioneers with a total of 131 points
in 16 games played. Don Rowe staVe
ed off the challenge of Marion Frye,
sophomore forward, and held second
place by a margin of one point.
Frye took part in one less game how—
even Rowe had 79 and Frye 73
points.

Dick Ullrich and Captain liIcCreary
followed this high-scoring trio nith
6-1 and 52 point, respectively. Mc-
Creu - was for out in front in the
number of free throws made with 26.
Ullrich was next with 18. Ullrieh lei,
however, in personal fouls, liaring 39
chalked up against him, wluc Mc-
Crem-y and Duncan rock committed
. none had the lowest number
among the first fire, 20.
e a .

A peculiar fact shown by the star
tistics is that in the last 12 games
the relative position in the scoring
standings of the Pioneer squad has
remained unchanged. This further-
illustrates the consistency which the
scarlet and black team exhibited in
its total each game.

Their defeat at Creighton brought
the pioneers record for the season
down to a 500 percentage, the team

Couch Tl'uesdalc‘s men scored 434
points against 459 for opponents, air
though until the last two games on

paratively cvell. In exactly half
the games the pioneer total
