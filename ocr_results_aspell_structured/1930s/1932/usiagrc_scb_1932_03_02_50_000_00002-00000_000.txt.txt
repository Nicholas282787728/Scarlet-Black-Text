satisfied were bilellt,

Students who condemn the _ (om lliust, re-
member that it was inaugurated following their
own demands ill a convocation program lost year.

trial, will make many men even more certain of
what they already SllSJJBCtilllzlt the student mind

THE APPLE POLISHER
(From the Daily Trojim)

Cursed be that wait in sheep's clothing, that snake
in the grass—the apple polisher. All the days of his life
he existeth only for the purpose of obtaining “A” grades,
whether by foul or by fair means. In class he waveth
his hand wildly to attract the professor's attention, and
he reeiteth in a soft. soothing, confidential voice of
lofty matters which he known to him and the professor
only. He imagineth that he livetli in a select intellect-
ual world, in company with only such learned persons
as professors and far removed from such swine as side
dents who receive “C’s," “D's.” and even ”F5.”

The apple polisher goeth up to the professor after
class and compliments him on the excellehcies of his
leetur He laughetb at the professor's jokes, calleth
upon him in his private office, proffereth him cigarettes,
and offeret'n to help grade his papers, Lo, he carrieth
many books, to appear studious. He feeieth sure that
the professor is not wise to his ways. surely unpopular-
ity and revilement shall follow him all the days of his
life, but he shall dwell in the land of. “A's" forever.

THE GLAMOUR OF THE PAST
(From the Daily Cardinal)

The glamour and custom of college life is what
fraternities want and what graduated fraternity men
held dearest. So the Northwestern Purple Parrot claims
in an editorial reprinted on this page.

We doubt it. Hell Week hasn't any glamour on
a close-up, IL’s a barbaric custom devoid of humor,
lacking in justification, distinctly brutal, and dangerous
to the pledge participants. If there is anything humol‘r
ous about a freshman at tasks which are both absurd
and degrading, we should like to see intelligent reasons
advanced for it. If excessive and unreasonable paddling
and .suhrni. ion to the taunts and whims of a group of
immature students can be justified, we have yet to
see the proof of it in the sp' 'it of men who have gradir
ated from Hell Week. If the physical fatigue from Hell
Week Is not to become brutality, we should like to
find the man in a fraternity who can judge what other
men of spirit who are both weak and strong will endure
without harm, Then, too, occasionally, we hear of a
man who is injured by the mistreatment dealt out to
him by good-hunioreu fraternity men whose emotions
have been raised to too high a pitch by the excitement.

The practice is upheld because it is customary
A man beats a freshman's sternworks because he had
his own beaten in bygone days. He likes to make a
legend of the number of cracks he received on the
gluteous maximus muscles, We can it an exaggeration;
the pledge does too.

Now for the statement that fraternity men "who

have been out of school for a couple of decades" find

this custom “nearest and dearest to their hearts.” Can ,

anyone imagine an intelligent man, aged 40 and sober,
applauding a performance which has less sportsmanship
in it than a bull fight? If such a man is representative
of fraternity alumni, we have erred in our estimate of
the older fraternity men who visit the campus now and
then.

Here's an answer to the “Hell Week Forever” man.
The most active and soholasticaily sound houses on
this campus are those which have adopted a policy
which minimizes or abolishes Hell Week, personal duties,
and paddling.

INTRAMURALS FOR ALL!
(From the St, Louis Student Life)

Announcement of the expansion of the athletic pro-
grain in the direction of swimming, track, and field
sports, and intramural activity in the gymnasium, should
be heralded as the seundest indication of genuine ser—
vice to the university to emanate from that department
in years.

The concentration upon large-scale football and has.
ketball for the benefit of a group of about 75 athletes
out of a student population of more than 3,000, whereby
the ordinary student becomes no more than a bystander,
is new fortunately of the past. Let us hope that it can
be an eternally dead past.

Physical education has its proper place in the de—
velopment of culture, just as the arts, sciences and pro~
fessions, and to deny it that place is definitely to impair
the quality of the culture. Moreover, it certainly must
not be restricted to a preferred group of gentlemen with
bulging muscles, who in the past seem to have been
guilty of placing too much rather than too little emphasis
upon this aspect of culture,

A great deal of the credit for this improvement goes
to the new athletic department personnel and to the
director of physical education.

Dear sir:

Grnniell college in a liberal arts
school founded and intended to give
to its students the foundation of a
well-rounded education and bearing
Monday night these students ex
pressed their knowledge through the
medium of cat-calls, jests, and even
ll'voillg at un cxltibiLion staged be-
tween halves of the basketball game.

Between the giggling and uttering
of the young ladies of the college.
who acted more like high school
freshman girls out on their first date,
and the sounds of dei'sion from the
honorable Honor G section, it turn»
ed into a humiliating experience for
those who participated in what
should have been an interesting ex»
hibition.

The failure of the spectators to
keep quiet even when so requested,
kept the men from hearing the com—
mands necessary for the unison that
is essential for this type of work. If
the Honor G would learn to have a
more cooperative spirit than him
been hibited at the basketball
games this season, and learn some
rules for sportsmanlike conduct and
decent behavior, the organization
could go a long way toward creating
a better fitLiLude on the campus as
a whole, as well as in the gymnasium.
The failure of even the Honor G to
have a respectable attitude toward
another angle of physical education
points out that at Grinnell our edur
cation is still unfulfilled in its put»
post),

To me, it turned out to be the
most humiliating event in physical
education that I have experienced
during the last 10 years and the fact
that it was caused by the ignorance
and beorishness of the college stu—
dents who could not be polite enough
to keep quiet offers only slight con-
solstion.

Sincerely,
