Artist Showed ‘Intelligence’
in Opening Recital

of Series

By H. w. MATLACK
(Professor of organ)

Three songs in the program given
last evening by Mme. Claire Dux in
Herrick chapel linger in my mind as
examples of her distinguished flleSr
try. They are, first, Mozart's superb
aiia “Deh vleni" from Figaro: sec-
ond, Schubert’s cradle—song; and
third, the magnificent old English
Christmas carol “Alleluia" which she
sang toward the end of the string of
encores which she so generously gave
before her audience dispersed,

Displays Genius

Each of these songs displays a difr
ferent aspect of her special genius,
which is, it seems to me, the gift of
seizing the noblest essence of each
composition and carrying it across to
her listeners. Mme. Dux does not
stop with revealing a magnificent
voice and finely wrought technique,
but she uses these, both her unique
natural gifts and the long and ardu—
ous application of a talented musical
intelligence, as vehicles for detecting
and revealing the hidden inner beau-
ties of great music so that all who
take the time to listen may perceive
them.

Her audience last night took all
the time that she would give them.
The ls songs on her printed program
were increased by nearly half before
she beamed her final farewell, Her
accompanist, the extraordinarily cap-
able Frederick Schauwecker, who has
been heard here before, was equally
at home in the formal classicism of
Mozart and the delicately tinted at-
mospheres of Debussy,

Contrasts Artist, Singer

Mme. Dux splendidly illustrated the
difference between a singer and an
artist. An artist is a singer with in-
telligence. Voice is one thing, train—
ing another, but they are sounding
brass and tinkling cymbal unless they
are illuminated by intelligence. It is
strange how often a wonderful voice
and wonderful technique exist in an
individual, entirely dissociated from
any gleam of intelligence or even
common sense.

Judging from the personality and
strength of intelligence shown in her
singing it is easy to understand how
Mme. Dux, who in private life is Mrs.
Charles H, Swift of Chicago, is emic
nent also as a social and civic leader.
She is on many important welfare
committees, and at present is active
on the general music committee for
the 1933 Century of Progress exposi-
tion in Chicago, of which the chair—
man is Frederick Stock.

New Harmony in
Europe Says Dr.

Curtius, Lecturer

"A new harmonious reorganization
in Europe” is noticeable to Dr. Julius
Ctll‘tius, former German: minister of
foreign affairs, who presented the
first address on the Criooell college
lecture course, Wednesday evening in
Herrick chapel.

Despite chaos in Europe, resulting
from the war, that continent is strive
ing toward solidarity, the speaker in-
ferred. To illustrate this condition,
he cited several customs unions and
lowering of protective tariffs.

“Europe must heuceforward recog-
nize itself as a part of the growing
life unit of mankind," Dr. Curtius
said. "This planet for the first
time is becoming one extensive dwell-
ing place of mankind."

In speaking of German party polls
LL. Curtius declared that ”Radical-
i n of German party life is a conse-
uufnce of the prevention of a free de»
veltprnent by pressure from the out-
side."

That the United States will not re-
main isolated from European affairs
was the hope which the speaker ex-
pressed ot the conclusion of his ad-
dress,

tem, Mr. Keithahn told of the atti~
tudes of the pcople of India towards
the Mahatma. In conclusion the

Business Administration Most Popular
Major Subject With Grinnell Students

Economics Heads List offender of the more popular majors,

Minors; English,
Speech High

Business administration is the most
popular major among the students of
Grlnncll college, according to a recent
investigation. As a minor economics
was chosen by more students.

Business administration was, of
course, far more popular with the
boys than with the girls. oh the
other hand more girls are taking
their major in English and speech.
Economics and history arc also popu—
lar fields for majors. Chemistry, an-

lies a greater representation from the
dormitories. Contrary to the belief
that girls do not care for mathematics
is the fact that the number of girls
majoring in that subject is slightly
greater than that of the boys. Jour-
nalism, philosophy, and German have
the lcnst number of students yrepaz»
ing their major in the department.
In the choice of economics as a
minor the boys again have the ma-
jority of the support. English and
history, ngain gaining their strength
from the girls, were near the top of
the list, but business administration
is not at all popular as a minor. The
least popular fields for a minor are
biology, botztny, German, and art.

Harriers Beat
Ames Runners

Captain, Pilbrow, Pfeiffer,
Tie for First

Scoring an unexpected triumph ov-
er the Iowa Statc harricrs this morn-
ing, the 1532 Grinnell college cross
country team seem determined to
prove the pre-season statement that
it is the best in the history of the
school. The Pioneer outfit was not
given much of a chance against the
Cyclones, but when Chapman and
Eichelkraut, two Iowa State Stars,
were forced out of the lineup last
week, Grinncll stock went a. little
higher.

Captain Pilbrow and Pfeiffer fin-
ished neck and neck to tie for first
place, and gave Coach Rosen’s men
a 23—29 victory. This pair ran a great
race all the way and were never sep-
arated by more than five yards af-
ter the first lap. The winning time
was limits, which was exceedingly
fast for the cold, rainy conditions un-
der which the race was run.

Tommy Gordon, Grinnell's spec-
tacular sophomore, dogged the heels
of GuSe for the long [warmlle grind.
and was frequently out in front of
him, but at the finish, however, Cuse
was still a yard ahead.

In fifth place was Captain Labert
of the cyclone team, who was follow—
ed by Highsmith, Rooks, and Chisr
holrn in the order named, to give
Iowa state third, fifth, sixth, sev-
enth, and eighth places.

The showing of Don Barber, Joe
Pojman, and Bus Brown, the other
three members of the Crinnell team,
was rather disappointing, since the
best they could do was ninth, tenth,
and eleventh. Barber weakened in
the final laps to drop back from
sixth to ninth.
