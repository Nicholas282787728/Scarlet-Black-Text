Applequist, Relay
Team to V/ithdraw

\ By Clark A. Smith

Burke Powers’ leap of 22 feet
9m inches was good enough to
win fifth place in the broad Jump
at the Drake Relays Friday after
noon against the best competition
the United States has to offer
west of the Mississippi.

The Pioneer mile relay team
was the only other Grinnell entry
to place in yesterday's program
that consisted mainly of prelim-
inaries. Luther. Cranny, Hagan
and Schlotterheck finished fourth
in their heat to qualify for the
final run today.

Bad luck again dogged Ted Ap<
pelquist. Pioneer sprint star, as
he pulled the same muscle in his
leg that has bothered him since
the Missouri valley conference in-
door meet and was unable to
compete in the loo-yard dash.

This morning. Coach G. Lester
Duke was placing his hopes upon
the two mile relay team of Peder-
sen. Mortimer, Seeger and Schlot—
terheck to run close to eight
minutes in their event and finish
well up in the final standings of
the teams.

The shuttle hurdle relay team.
which was expected to be com-
peting today in the University
section. was forced to withdraw
when Frank Pfohl sprained his
ankle in practice Wednesday; and
the injured memher failed to ree
spond to treatment in time to
round the sophomore timber top-
per into shape for the event.

Top OfFRractice
With Traditional
Battle Friday

Spring foothnll drills will he
topped off this week by an intra-
Squall game next Friday.

Although about two dozen men
are reporting for practice. all are
not reporting on the same night,
and coach Guy Lookahaugh is
bending every effort to get these
men to report on the same nights
next week in older to shape up
two teams for the traditional
spring battle.

The practices thus far have
stressed fundamentals above all.
and the men have been put
through the paces as blockers and
tacklers countless times in order
to get them in shape for the com-
ing game, according to Coach
Lookahangh.

The timing of the plays has
been speeded up considerably, and
Lookahaugh has been experiment-
ing with different backfield com-
binations which he will try in the
intrasquad game.
