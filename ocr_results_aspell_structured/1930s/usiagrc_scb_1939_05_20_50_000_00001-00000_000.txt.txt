Rift Caused in
lnves'liga’rion on

Cribbing Problem

A rift appeared in the student
committee selected to propose a
solution for the cribbing prob-
lem this week, when Harry Kies,
president of the Council of House
Presidents, resigned from the
group.

Kiss Gives Pusasons.

Kies gave the committee the
following reasons for his action:

(1) He had been advised by stue
dents that the subject of cribbing
was very unpopular witn the ma—
jority of the men on the campus,

(2) The Council of House Pres
idents did not have articular
jurisdiction in
the matter and
had other duties
to occupy their
time. , >

(3) 'He did not

Friars, Mortar

Board, and the

where the stu- HARRY rims.
dent body had given a mandate
for any action.

(4) “The committee seems to
he trying to work out a cure for-
symptoms rather than trying to
determine the causes for crib-
hing,” Kies concluded.

Homann Denies Charges.

Fred Homann, president of
Friars and chairman of the group,
commented, “The remaining inem.
bers of the committee feel after

of the students are desirous of

‘Never Say Die’
Is Attitude to
Improve Preps

Here it is again: The week-end
that the upperclassmen live for-
and the one that most preps
think should be omitted has rolled
around, and is in excellent posie
tion to take all comers.

It is a fitting tribute to Grins
nell's men that they should make
this second attempt to improve
this year's freshmen. Rumor has
it that if the job is not complete
ed this time the cause will be
given up.

Smith hall is leading the field
in leniency this year, perhaps
realizing the improbability of
making improvements on this
year's crop. Smith will be thor-
oughly cleaned, and their house
party should be good.

Langan is attempting to show
the boys a good timc, and at the
same time not be too hard on
them. The individual assignments
carry the most interest, some of
which cannot be printed due to
our strict censorship.

A new theme is being estab-
lished this year by Rawson. It is
Fort Rawsou. The idea is cai ed
out by the sentries who are on
duty during the day and night
with the flag and cannon as syme
hols.

Gates hall stole the show at
open house last night, Their preps
had to dance through the evening
without their modesty, and the
non-daters provided a glimpse of
hellcweck at its best.

Clark hall has been pointing
most of its efforts toward coir
structive improvements. The ru-
mor that barbed wire entangle-
ments will be thrown up by the
preps between Clark and Dibule
is entirely unfounded.

Dibble began with a prayer for
rain, in which some of the upper-
classmen turned traitor and we-
tered their comrades. Finally
the rain really fell with soap suds
