Freshmen, Juniors Win
7 in First Round
on Monday

Runaway scorcs marked the
opening round of the annual inter-
class basketball series, with the
freshmen trouiicing the seniors
36720, and the juniors outclasslng
the sophomores 22-9. Monday aft-
eriioon.

The freshmen-senior tilt was
purely an offensive struggle with
neither side showing much in the
way of defensive skill. SIcheH
frosh played in the game and the
superior manpower was a telling
factor.

Prep Scorers

Pedersen and Dave Miller led
the prep scoring with eight and
SIX points respectively, while Nash
and Neiman were outstanding for
their floor play. Rossman was the
whole show for the senior-s, ring
ing up 13 counters for high point
honors.

Harvey and Cornish collaborated
to score 16 points for the juniors in
their game with the sophs. The su-
pcrior height ot these two men was
more than the margin of differ-
ence. Cornish. who was regarded
as a likely varsity prospect, was
declared ineligible by the Missouri

The Russians have come
town!

Mr Afonsky could quote Caesar
with complete justiﬁcation and
say, “Vein, Vid, Vic , It was in
deed an evening of triumph for
the director and for the 18 singers
of the Moscow cathedral choir A
large and enthusiastic audience
would not let it be otherwise.

I think back to the Don Cossack
program last year and recall the
spell which it cast over me, The
effect of last evenings program
was no less hypnotic I was in a
Russian cathedral, I was with the
peasants in the fields, I danced
their dances, I sang their songs of
love and work In my imagination
I was one of them. The singers
were successful in-so-far as they
were able to capture your imagi-
nation and bring you similar exe
pericnccs. It is in the nature of
great music to do this.

Phelps Believes Proposal
for Rink lrnpractical

A proposal for a campus ice
skating rink this winter was
termed outrofrtherquestion by Lou-
is v, Phelps. college treasurer,
when interviewed Tuesday.

The pioposal, sponsor-ed by a
joint committee of representatives
of the Young Women's and Young
Men's Christian associations, was
to construct an ice—skating rink
near the campus for the use of 001*
lege students.

Uncertain Weather

Mr. Phelps in explaining why the
plan was considered impractical
pointed out that uncertainty of
the weather made such a plan un-
proﬁtable, and that past experh
ences with such a plan had proved
it to be unsuccessful.

Such a rink as the one proposed
by the plan was constructed sev-
eral years ago just north of Dibr
ble hall, but proved to be unsuc-
cessful because of unexpected
weather changes and the expense
of keeping the rink in shape, ac-
cording to Mr, Phelps.

May Usc Country Club

Consent for college students to
use the skating rink at the Grin—
ncll Country club has been given
by Dr. E. s. Korfmacher, prc ‘
dent of the organization.

“If the college will cooperate,"
Dr. Korfmacher sai , "I will be
glad to give the students the use
of the rink, i[ it is under compe-
tent supervision anrl kept clean
from snow.”

music—the folk-song and that
written for the church The folk-
songs “Kamal‘inska” and “Tahi-
koo" gave us jolly melodies which
movcd in fantastic leaps and
bounds with rhythms too fleeting
and complex for analysis. The
harmonies werc a strange mixture
of thc primitive and post-Palesr
trinian periods, and the words
were the everyday expressions of
the common people.

If you contrast with these the
“Hymn of the thrubims" written
for the church, you see clearly that
the latter differs in that it is
bound by the limitations of the
Greek liturgy as regards text and
temper, and by the more self-
conscious and personal touch of a
specific composer In both folk
and church music the csscntial
vigor of thc Russian temperament
asserts itself; both are filled with
emotion and sharp contrasts.

Church Songs Best

The fir-st group of songsithose
which were written for the church
iseemed to me to reveal the choir
at its best. The singers were com-
pletely an entity both in spirit and
execution. Vitality of tone, pres
cision of attacks and releases and
brilliance of vocal color character-
ized each musical phrase. Mr,
Afonsky caught all the values of
the music and brought them to us
so convincingly that we readily
surrendered to the changing emo-
tions of the different numbers.
Particularly well done were the
“Te Deum Laudamus," “Hospodl
Pomilui” (already familiar to
many on this campus” and “Cre-
do."

The secular songs comprising the
second and third groups gave li-
cense for a greater freedom and
abandon I liked especially the
“Persian Song" with the incidental

"Candidates for the vacancy on
the editorial board of the Scarlet
and Black, caused recently by the
resignation of Wells Baniett,
sports editor, should get in touch

nett’s resignations, said, “Mr. Bar-
nett i-csigned because he found
that he was unable to take care of
both his duties as sports editor
and as a membcr of the editorial
board. He will devote all his time
to the sports department of the
papcr."

Luther Lost
to Cage Team ‘
for Season

Loss of Sophomores Dims
Pioneer Cage Hopes
For 1936-37

By wells Bin-nett

Pioneer air castles, built on
rosy predictions of a powerful
cage team this year, began to
sway dangerously Tuesday when
it was announced that two star-
sophomores were out or compe-
thlonione for the remainder of
Lhe year and one for an indefinite
period.

First of the two sophomores is
wilbur Luick, giant center, who
Tuesday announced his intention
of quitting basketball temporarily.
Luick received a condition in
French at mid-semester which
made him incligiblc for the Iowa
State Teachers game last Monday,
and yesterday declared that he
was quitting basketball until he
had a more thorough mastery of
the language. It is not known
when he will reappear for prac-
tice.

Fred Luther Out

The second sophomore star to
be lost was Fred Luther, for-
ward, who chipped a bone in his
shoulder ear-1y in Monday's game
and wlll not be able to play for
the rest of the year. Luther de—
finitely established himself zts an
outstanding star in the few min-
utes he was able to play against
the Tutors. scoring three points
after a mix-up had caused the in-
jury.

As a consequence, things were
pretty muddled Tuesday. The one
ray of light was the fut that
[Robert Berry, six-foot, [Weaand-
Ithree—fourths-inch s o p h o m o r e
guard and center who was declar-
ed ineligible last week, has made
up his work and will be ready to
go when the Pioneers engage in
their second test of the season
against Iowa state at Arnes Fri-
day night.
