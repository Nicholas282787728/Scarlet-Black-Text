Considering the that that men and
women mmy 1)!in cards on Sundays
in their own cluhrooms. what do you
think of their playing intrus- together
on Sundays at open houses?

SIAI’iDll Man—There are so few
means of entertainment available for
Sundays. it sccms only logical that
men and women Should be allowed to
play cards together at open houses
on Sunday evenings.

Pasquale Ferriu-ft 7 Perfectly (le-
cent. There is nothing imspiritual-
like in card playing on Sunday or
any other time.

Sidney Himes—I agree With Patsy.

Eleanor luchllliAS long as the
men’s clubrooms are to be open Suns
day nights there is no reason why
they Shouldn’t entertain as they see
ﬁt.

Pﬂul Crawford—Since my ideas on
card playing are limited. I’m hardly
qualiﬁed to make a, statement. IJLIL I
fail to See any difference in whether
the fellows or girls play by them»
selves 01' with each other. I believe
they should play together because it
would be more beneﬁcial than partic-
lpatlon in the usual Sunday night en»
tertainment. DO I need to mention
the entertainment to which ['11] 1'27

June Cill'lsaniAs long as they
don’t ﬂaunt. their cards in the eyes
Of the public. I can think of no rear
son why the men and women should
not play cards Sunday evenings in
the clubrooms.

In the two games played SO far
this season. the Pioneers have scored
six touchdowns and Frank Duncan.
big left-banded end, has been re»
sponsihle for three of them. He leads
the conference in scoring.

So strong was the south wind at
Cedar Falls Saturday that no punt
against it traveled more than 25
yards. Ullrich found the wind a de-
cided handicap on kickoffs, too. When
the Pioneers turned around it was 2!
different; story, however, since Dick
got off one boot that traveled ’10
yards in the air.

The playing of Chuck Bilto at
tackle has been one of the delights
of the coaches. Shifted there from an
end position. he has' withstood a
great deal of battering.

nell-Cornell football game today.
