CUTTING REST PERIODS

Ruin rnllllillg, it appears, is about the only
sport ill which the rules remain the some .Year in
and year out. Since there are no rules there, such
a thing is possible. The most recent addicts to the
rule alteration fashion are the basketball e "per
who have changed the time out rule to perlllit only
one minute periods of time instead of two minutes
as has been the practice heretofore.

Baseball is in the midst of the live ball COllr
trovcrsy. golf lnld’crwent a change ill the ball being
used, and football has been changing annually for
several years. The good which the changes ac-
complish is questionable. To the spectator, football
is probably an infinitely better game now than it
was 10 or 15 years ago. To coaches and players it
is a much more difﬁcult game. With guards pulling
out, ends swinging around, unbalanced lines, spot
and screen passes, play continually becomes more
complicated and difﬁcult.

The change to one-minute time out periods in
basketball may be an improvement. The move was
designed to speed up the game ill view of com
plaints in some quarters that the game was slow-
ing down. These Same oolllplaints, however, rc~
sulted not from the time ollt waits, but from the
superdelayed offense which many teams are using.
This offense is merely a stalling game and docs
serve to make the game boring for spectators whose
only interest is to see the players hit the hoop.

Coach John C. Trllesdalc has treated Grinncll
fans to a novel flexing offense which is patterned
on a limited delaying pattern. Pioneer quilltets
do not use a stalling game continually and conse-
quently there has been little complaint about slow
Yames here. ,

The new rule will not speed the game very

'ch. Players, knowing that their rest periods will
\horter, will conserve their energy as much as
hle. If any injustice is operating in this new

IS THIS SUCCESS?

\\’llile the closing of the library stacks to stu—
dents has been successful since it has prcvcntcd
the loss of books, the action has not been without
its unfortunate aspects. Decreased interest in read-
ing has been lll oil, for the less bookish student
might occasionally Wander into the stacks, fol'lllt‘l'r
ly, to read on othrr than assigned subjects, but
hc now has very little illcenilx . Frcqucntly‘a stu-
dent can ﬁnd no inspiration from the card index.
but if allowed to form the habit of browsing can
satisfy his \l'allts easily.

By stationing an assistant at the stack room
door to check ill the books as the students leave,
dishonesty might be avoided. This ImOVC might
also reduce the cost of maintaining extra librarr
ians required under the present system. For these
reasons the new management of The Scarlet alld
Black rellcws its stand for the opening of the
Stacks.

THE SCHOLAR—A'I‘HLETE
(From the Christian Science Monitor)

A new ﬁgure is emerging on the ﬁeld of American
intercollegiate sportithe scholar-athlete. He combines
intelligence in the classroom with grit and skill on the
gridiron, diamond or track. He is neither a pale, book-
ish recluse, nor the athlete pictured as “husky but
dumb,” to whom college means little more than a train
ing camp. Well rounded in his activities. he offers proof
that athletics and intelligence pursuits may work to.
gether and even aid each other.

HARVARD'S PRAISE
(From Harvard Alumni Bulletin)

In the death of President John H. T. Main of Grins
neil college, Harvard has lost a good friend and liberal
education one of its most stalwart leaders. A oiasslcist
by training, President Main could never wholly sympa-
thize with the utilitarian trend of education in that
section of the country in which he spent most of his
life. He believed that while the great state universities
rendered a notable and indispensable public service there
was nevertheless a place in the middlewest for the
smell, liberal arts college which should nourish and
perpetuate the older tradition. Because he identiﬁed
that tradition with New England, and with Harvard
in particular, he was largely instrumental in arranging
the exchange which sends a member of the Harvard
faculty every year to Grinnell, Knox, Colorado, Pomona,
Carleton and Beloit.

As a result of his ideas and his powerful person-
ality, Grinnell, while comparatively small in numbers
and resources, was distinguished by its high standards

the most

of scholarship. At the same time, though free from any ,

suspicion of bigotry or narrow sectarianisrn. Grinnell
preserved an unquestionable moral and religious tone.
It was Characteristic of Grinnell that morning chapel
should have been both voluntary and well attended,
and that President Main should have been its central
ﬁgure. He was a scholar and a Christian gentleman
of the ”old School,” and yet hospitable to novelty and
tolerant of differences.

The agricultural region in which Grinnell is situated
has suffered ﬁnancial depression in recent years, and
President Main's task was not easy; but he never fai-
tered. and fought bravely on almost to the hour of
death. Many members of the Harvard faculty who have
been exchange professors at Grinnell in recent years
will treasure their personal memories of his kindly
dipity and generous hospitality. Having awarded him
the honorary degree of LLD. in 1926, Harvard is proud
to be identiﬁed with what he stood for and to number
him among her sons.

COLLEGE IDEALS

(From the Southern California Daily Trojan)

Colleges of olden days were devoted to the moral
and idealistic uplifting of the youths who attended them.
The young men were thrown into the midst of an in-
tellectual atmosphere and scholarly life, and generally
emerged rooting for the honor and glory of dear old
Alma Mater with tears in their eyes and a frog in
their throats. Now, matters are changing. It is no longer
possible for a college man to wander over Elysian ﬁelds,
indulge in meditation, write odes to the futility of exists
once or the inevitability of spring, and maintain a
chastity which forswore cigars and hard liquor.

Do college men drink? Do college men smoke? Or
better, old college Women smoke? Such questions har-
boring doubtfully around the neighborhood of ethics or
morals or something are to be laughed off with great
scorn. There are, of course, people who do not, but they
are college students, and not necessarily college men
and women, if you see the difference.

Briefly, college morals are placed upon an equivocal
foundation. Despite the efforts of deans and counsellors
to inﬂuence the freshmen to “hold, as best you can,
those ideals which you bring here with you," the steady
grinding goes on and class after class disintegrate: into
a group of students and a group of proﬁigates. And man
after man, and woman after woman, gets discouraged,
loses his ideals, and winds up after 20 years as haw'ng
got nothing from college but the distinction of being
an “old grad."

The point of this tirade is that Colleges are not
exerting any 'sort of moral or ethical influence over
their students. The professors are more intent upon
making names for themselves than in teaching the
students anything that would help them build their
philosophy of life. They are content with letting the ad-
ministration of the university appoint a pair of deans
to interrupt dance plans, interfere with rushing seasons,
and censor books in lthe college library. All these, no
loubt, are laudable pursuits, but are negative inﬂuences

“i not constructive work.

Banner Award:

Four newspaper contests, with a.
traveling cup and permanent banner

given, and it was necessary to win
the prize three years in succession
before a paper could assume perman-
ent ownership of the trophy. This
year the same ruling has been made
in regard to traveling cups, but a
felt banner, with the name of the
contest. donor, and publication
inscribed on it, also will be awarded
to each of the four winners as perms
anent prizes to be placed in the ofr
ﬁce of the paper.

April Grinnell and You
Prints President Main’s
Last Message to Alumni

A copy of President J.H.T. Mnin's
last message to Crinnellisns appears
on the cover of the April issue of
the Grinnell and You. In it, he ex—
presses his regret in being unable to
join the Chicago alumni in their anu-
nual meeting. “I shall be with you in
thought and in spirit and shall revl
joioe in you as loyal Grinnellians.”

This special issue deals primarily
with the career of President Main.
“His face was always to the fur
ture, and his vision kept enlarging
with each new step in alivance," is
one statement. "One has only to look
at Crinneil now to see the breadth of
his vision and the strength of his ace
complishment. He let nothing dim tin-
clear light of pure truth that was his
guide of life, and which he brought
us to see, and to follow as nearly as
We can.”

An outline of commencement plans
includes a memorial service-for Presi-
dent Main on Saturday, June 6. This
will give many alumni the opportun-
ity of paying their respects to him.
