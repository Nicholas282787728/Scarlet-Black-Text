Drake, Tulsa and Creighton took
the lead in Missouri valley con-
ference football circles this week,
as all conference teams opened
hostilities. The Bulldogs were
particularly surprising as they
took the measure of the Washing-
ton Bears by a 3272 score. The
victory gave Drake a temporary
hold on first place as it was the
only conference game thus far.

The Golden Hurricane from Tul-
sa looked plenty good as they de~
feated Oklahoma university, a Big
Six team, by a 1977 score, Tulsa,
conference carchampions with
Creighton, have a good chance to
retain at least their share of the
title, barring trouble with Drake

Biggest Upset

Biggest upset of the week was
scored by Creighton's Bluejays,
who defeated St. Benedicts, un-
beaten for two years, do. At-
tended by one of the largest
crowds in Creighton’s history, the
game capped the climax of a two-
year campaign waged by Coach
Marchie Schwartz to revive a
flagging interest in football at
the Catholic school.

St. Louis university, added to
the conference last spring, gave
warning of impending trouble for
other conference teams by rolling
over James Millikin, 37.0, while
the Oklahoma Aggies, a fairly un»
known quantity, set back Wichita
university, 14-3, a score which
might indicate that the Aggies
are not too much to be feared.

Casualties

Only casualties in the league
were Grinnell and Washbum. The
Pioneers were disappointing in a
6-0 defeat by Cornell college and
Washburn fell before Emporia
(Kan) Teachers, 16r6.

Only conference game this week
will be a clash between Creighton
and Oklahoma A K: M, which
should give the Jays a flying start
toward the title. Drake will step
a bit out of its class and tackle
Notre Dame at South Bend, Ind.;
St. Louis U. meets Missouri Mines;
Tulsa plays Central. okla., Teach

Grinnell’s prep gridders, under
the direction of Coach Doyle Rey-
nolds, trotted out to their first
practice session of the current
season Monday.

While the first week will he de-
voted entirely to conditioning and
ballrhandl‘lng, the squad will soon
begin running the varisty’s Sign
rials. For as coach Reynolds
says, “The coaching staff feels
that the boys will have a decided
advantage by being thoroughly
familiar with the working mech-
anism of Coach Lookabaugh's dou-
ble wingback formation"

Games with Coe and Cornell
have already been scheduled. The
boys from Cedar Rapids will be
met Nov. 6. while Cornell invades

Pioneers have a large assignment
Friday night.

Lookahauglrs chief concern this
week is to improve center play.
All three of the varsity centers are
inevperienced, and Lookabaugh
feels that animprovementintheir
play will lessen the chance of
costly fumbles such as spoiled
Gl‘lnnell's touchdown chances so
many times Thursday. Looka-
baugh is not alibing, but he read-
ily admits that fumbles more
than any single factor, were re-
sponsible for Cornell's victory.

Blocking stressed

In addition to center play,
blocking and tackling will be par-
ticularly stressed this week.
along with kicking and passing.
Kicking drills Monday night one
covered the fact that Bob Jones,
beefy tackle, had improved con-
siderably in that department, and
it is quite likely that he will
handle the kicking assignment
against the Tutors.

In the ,event that Jones does
handle the kicking, Burke Powers
will very likely start in Hay-
ward’s place at right end. He will
probably be paired with Boller
at left end. The tackles will prob-
ably be taken care of by Jones
and Wittrock, and High and Cs-
borne vn'll star at guards. Grimes
will, in all probability, start
again at center. In the back—
field Capt. Freston Evans, Show,
Sampson and Schlotterbeck will
be head men.

By \‘Vells Barnett

Coach Guy Lookabaugh answers
some questions on football:

Q. Why is it that Crinnell used
so many spinners and reverses
Thursday against Cornell, when it
looked as though Cornell was fig.
uring them out ahead of time?

A. If you’ll look at the record of
that game, you’ll find that most
of Gi‘innell’s substantial gains
were made on just those spinners
and reverses, and that the straight
stuff wasn't getting much of any-
where. It wasn't bad signal-calling
but funihies that lost the game for
us. (Sorry, Guy, my mistake. Ed.)

Q. Why is it that Grinnell kick-
ers line up only eight or ten yards
back of the line of scrimmage in-
stead of 10 or 12 yards? Isn't
that dangerous

A. No, it is not dangerous. A
kicker who is 10 or more yards
behind the line of scrimmage is in
such a position that the opposing
end can attack his kicking foot on
almost a straight line. A kicker-
lined up only eight yards back
forces the end to come at him in
a circle around the blockers. on-
viously, the circular route is the
longer, and there is less chance of
the kick being blocked. I have had
less kicks blocked from this for.
motion than from any other I
have used.

Q. In that case, why was it that
Cole blocked Hayward's kick and
paved the way for Cornell’s touch-
down?

A. Simply because one man for-
got to block Cole, and left him
wide open to get at the kicker.

Q. What do you think of the
Iowa State Teachers college
team?

A. I saw them play Saturday,
and saw plenty of strong points,
but I did not see a single weak-
ness. Their backs handle the ball
on laterals like a basketball.

‘Q. What do you propose to do
about those lateral passes? Have

they got you worried?

A. No, I’m concerned about
them, but not worried. We pro-
pose simply to tackle the ballscafz
riers, which is the most effective
way of stopping anything.
