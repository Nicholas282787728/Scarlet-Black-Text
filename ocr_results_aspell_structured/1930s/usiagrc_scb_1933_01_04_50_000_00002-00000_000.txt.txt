TIME) SOULS

We listened to an interesting
chapel talk—with which we did
not agreciyestel’day.

The speaker tended to give the
impression thotrhe was not in no,
cordoucc with The Scarlet and
Black’s campaign for advance
anllollnocmcnt of all chapel pro-
grams.

His reasons for desiring to keep
them a secret are two-fold (1) it
would be unfair 10 the speaker,
and (2) advance announcements
would make the chapel have the
aspect of a theatre rather than a
place of worship.

It is a deplorable fact that one
of the main reasons why chapel
programs are not made public be
forehand is that some of the
scheduled speakers are so touchy
about their oratory abilities that
if only a small audience came to
listen they would be offended and
probably never speak again.

It is our opinion that Such time
idity should- have been conquered
long before they became profess
ol's.

And, what about the student?
It would be splendid if he wont
to chapel each morning to relax
and worship. But he docsll’t. He
goes either to learn something or
to be entertained, and when he is
disappointed more than two or
three times, he loses interest and
soon drops chapel altogether.

Those students who do actually
attend chapel to relax and \\'0Yr
ship surely would not be influ-
enced by the announcement of
the program ill advance and those
who do not would undoubtedly
benefit. ‘

As to chapel taking on the as
pcct of the theatre, because of the
announcement of speakers ill ad-
vance, we can only refer to so
cral churches ill Grillllcll which
have regular announcements of
services, sermon topics, etc., pub-
lished regularly ill the news
papers—and still remain churches
rather than lhcnér s.

OPPORTUNITY
(Columbia Spectator)

Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler has
placed the future of the grand old
Republican party in the hands of the
youth of the land, We are skeptical
as to the willingness of youth to ac»
cept so distasteful a burden. For
most of the thinking young people
we have been in Contact with, the
names Republican and Democrat have
been so taintcd by intellectual fraud
and political juggling as to render
any affiliation with them impossible
Without the sacrifice of self-respect.

Allegiance to a. "new and truly
liberal party," it seems to us, would
be given much more rapidly by the
young men and women named by Dr.
Butler as the hope of tomorrow. The
birth of such a party under "cou-
structive, forward—facing and liberal
leadership," if Such is to be had,
would produce a focusing point for
the loyalties of dissatisfied American
youth.

There is t't dangerous tendency
for women to use the new tech
niquc of beautification to sewc a
growing recklessness of behavior.

FOR FALSE PATRIOTISM
(The Daily Northwest/cut)

Our institutions of higher learning

should produce intelligent, cooldiead.

ed individuals. Their mental capacity

ti; should be_ sufficient to enable them

to remain aloof from the sloppy sen-
timentallsm evinced in the sort ol
claptrap which floats forth on the
[leery breath of every American
Le‘gn'on convention,

Yet, when we read a letter such as
that published under the title, “Davy
Jones’ Own San" we realize that, dc»
spite all our utt‘cmpts at education,
we will never be able to cease err
ricbing the world with D. A. R. af-
tel‘dinncr speakers.

”Doe‘s he realize what that care»
molly means to many dads whose
sons are now lying in France?" Well,
what does it mean? Is it not because
of just such ceremonies as these,
with the attendant over-emphasized
patriotism, that several million
corpses were piled up as a rather
smelly monument to the sweet name
of democracy, ju‘st fourteen years
ago?

Then the writer goes on to explain
that the review was not a wot-like
display. We thank him for the court
ery. We thought it a warning that
America can and will defend itself——
pardon our density!

§G4
THE PHILOSOPHY or"
NONCHALANCE
(The Park Stylus)

Ever since, in that one year 1918,
the World War came to an end, a
way of thinking has developed in
both literature and life which for
convenience we would like to call
the Philosophy of Nonchalance. Our
reason for dealing with it here is
that it has exerted an influence on
collegiate thinking and therefore on
collegiate journalism stronger than
any other one element.

One of the strongest results of the
war is its effect on people who were
too young to know precisely what it
was all about. It is not at allsurpris-
ing that the generation which went
unscathed through the war should
have, as a result, a new slant on liv-
ing, but it is interesting that the
slant should be somehow conveyed to
the minds of the next generation,
which is ours.

The attitude is best characterized
by contrasting it with the complacent
trust nearly everyone had before
1914 that the world was in a very
‘rosy state. The generation which
fought in France will never again
aelmowledge surprise or terror; they
have adopted a policy of complete
nonchalanee; they are whistling as
they walk through the graveyard.
Our generation has borrowed this
viewpoint, and has become hard,
calloused, bitter, literal; and college
writing has become, in consequence,
imitative (sometimes brilliantly) of
the Menckens, the Dreisers, the Helm»
ingways, the Hllxleys and the
Lewises.

There are a number of valuable
things about the Philosophy of Non-
chalance. One is its merciless scorn
of sham and hypocrisy; or, at worst,
its frankness about its own hypoc-
risy: never have people been so bon-
est about. their dishonesty. Another
is the absence of sentimentality.
Sentiment is lacking in modern letr
ters almost to a fault. College stu-
dents who read cannot fail tb be cog-
nizant, as tsudent-s never have been
before, of the blatant hypocrisy in
the midst of which they live, But; it
is not letters alone which have
brought cleansightedness; it is a
cast of mind, an intellectual approach
which we have inherited from a war-
shocked generation—even those of
us who have neither the time or the
inclination to read. Realism is not
the mere fashion of the moment: it
is a basic characteristic of an era.
Nor has it been lessened in intensity
by the mechanics of the civilization
in which we live, or by the glaring
idiocies of the political system whose
supreme specbaele we have just wit-
nessed.

But in thc next intellectual cycle
(since viewpoinu manifestly move
in cycles) the reaction must be to-
ward the high tide of comfortable
content and goodnatured sentiment
which characterized the “gay Nine-
ties" and the "naughty Ougbties."
Within the next 50 years, we giihly
predict. we shall return (perhaps with
the heralded return of beer) to this
viewpoint, growing very tired of
cheerless realism and dogmatic down-
terazthihess. Illusions, we are here
to witness, are Very fine things.

NEWSYAI‘ERS AND HOW TO
TREAT THEM
(Dolly O'Couegian)

It is interacting to notice the dif-
ferent attitudes of administration
and faculty members toward public-
ity. Some have not learned that it
is best to accept the newspaper re-
porter as a necessary evil, take him
into their confidence, talk with him
openly and honestly, and make no
attempt to dictate to the paper as
to what should be printed or how the
story should be handled. Others,
much wiser, welcome the paper's
representative, are open in their

 

answers to questions, and trust to
his judgment for a fair story. And
they are rarely disappointed.

What We are trying to emphasize
is not so much our grievance at those
who fail to cooperate with our re-
porters or with us, but the fact that
it is poor policy to follow if good
publicity is-expccted. None ll‘eed ever
dread taking a newspapel‘man into
his confidence. If the story is big
enough, we are going to get it one
Way or another, with or without; the
permission of the person concerned.
It is much better to make certain
the facts are correct and that idle
rumors are not given credence.

Some day it is possible that every-;
one w'ill realize that. it is sensible to
be fair with newspapers. Most of
those occupying the positions of
greatest responsibility and power 817
really know it.

Glancing over the record of the
Butler university basketball teams in
the last six years, since Coach
“Tony” l—linkle has taken over the
reins, Lhc Bulldogs have compiled the
remarkable percentage of .826 for
games won and lost. Butler’s 35-12
will from Drake was the 100th win

in 121 games.

so.

Butler is the only college to be
awarded both the national A. A. U.
cllmnpinllship and the national inter-
collegiate eliampiousbip. The Indian—
apolis team won the A. A. U. title
in 1924, and Hillldc’s combination of
1928-29 was adjudged wuuicr of the
Veteran Athletes of Philadelphia
trophy.

Since Hinkle took over the coach
lug duties in 1926, Butler's scoring
average has been 32 points a game
compared to 20 for their opponents.
These achievements were made
against. teams that were anything
but ”Set-ups". Prominent; on the
schedule in recent years have been
Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Purdue,
Wabash, Loyola of Chicago, Southern
California, Alabama, Montana state,
Brigham Young, and Nebraska.
