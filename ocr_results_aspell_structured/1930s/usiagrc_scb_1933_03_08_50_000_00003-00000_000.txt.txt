Although most of us do not give
much credit to the mythical teams
that are selected by many sports
writers and coaches after the con-
clusion of airy particular sport sear
son, it should be at least fairly (uh
thentic, and mildly interesting to
note the selection of an all-opponent
team by the members of thc Grinnell
varsity basketball squad. Ten mem-
bers of tiie first string cast votes for
their choice of the best players who
they met this season.

FIRST TEAM
Fonl'ard—Collirl (Creighton)
Forward—Good (Coo)
Ceriter—Profiitt (Butler)

Guard— ly (Creighton)
Guard—Baird (Butler)

SECOND TEAM
Fonvnrd—Bohinsori (Mum)
Forward—Wade (Okla. Aggies)
Center—Grandone (St. Louis 1!.)
Guard—Licht (Minn)
Guard—Muller (Washington)
Two of the men, Collin and Kiely,

both h‘om Creighton, were unani-
mously selected for the first team.
while Baird, of Butler, received eight
votes for the guard berth. to rank
third in popularity. It is interesting
to note that four of the men on the
first team, and Six of the men on the
two teams. were within the Missouri
Valley conference. Good. of Coe, nos-
ed out Wade and Robinson of Okla-
home Aggies and Minnesota universi-
ty, respectively, for a first place for.
ward honor. The -latter two received
the same number of votes.

According to news dispatches
from Creighton u.n ersity at oina.
ha, Coach Art Stark plans to start
spring football practice this week
and to continue it until July I, if
that nrueh time is necessary to as- '
sure him that his cohorts are suf-
ﬁciently prepared to face the stiff
schedule that is below: them. We
can’t figure out it he is tr ing to
force his men into becoming gdod
football players, or whether he is
just a bear for prurislu-ncut; but at
any rate, iour months of spring
lralniﬂgv without games to break
the monotony sccrns to be just a
wee bit strenuous.

Coach Lester Watt called his grid
men together Monday for the first
time, anrl nearly 40 men have been
issued suits already. Watt states that
the practice will continue up until
spring vacation and possibly a few
days after that. The spring session
will be wound up with an interrsquad
battle.

70‘

Coach Elton Rosen‘s swimming
team will complete, what has been so
far, a perfect swimming season, when
they enter the Missouri valley Con—
ference meet at St. Louis: Saturday
afternoon. Little is known of the
strength of the southern teams, wrth
the exception of the Washington unis
varsity tanksters, who are reputed
to he quite “the fish.” We hope that
still another connotation can he put
on that word when Grinnell opposes
them.

Although Drake iuiiversity has
not had a team in competition so
far this year, it has been amiounc—
.ed that they may be entered in the
conference meet, boasting of two
particularly adept swimmers. One
of the Drake swimmers, Prouty. is
considered among the best back-
strokers in this section of the coun-
try. Never-tbe-lcss. Grinnell will
probably be able to pick up enough
second and ﬂﬁrd places in addition
to the firsts they may win, to ward
off those opponents, at least.

igﬁ

An interesting note regarding the
swimming meet last Saturday after-
noon against Iowa State is revealed
in the fact that by winning the no
freestyle from Murphy, Clark Elbert
fulfilled a three-year attempt. Both
Murphy and Elbert live in Des Moines,
and have raced each other as oppon—
ents as members of the Roosevelt and
North high swimming teams, respec»
tively: and on the Grinnell and Iowa
State swimming teams. The defeat
for Murphy in the 440 was not only
the first time for Elbert to win over
him, but also the first time that he
has been defeated in this event. In
splashing his way to first place Ele
bcrt hung up a new pool record of
5:42 , chopping four seconds from
his o .1 mark.

Improperly wrapped cigarettes begin to

Camels are cooler because they come

A cigarette that is fresh, full of natural -

a fresh cigarette, made from costlier

tobaccos.
