“TEE CAMPUS BEAUTIFUL"

How long, oh Lord, how long must we walk gingerly around the
edge of the unsightly pile of trash which adorns the north wall of
the heating plant every time we travel to and from the quad.

If in the spring a young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
love, think how prasaic it is to be confronted by such a lowly thing as
a junk heap on returning home from a date.

Seriously, however, we wonder if something could not be done to
eliminate such unsightly places as the dumps by the heating plant
and at the north end of Ward field. The amount of work necessary
would be negligible and the beautifying effect would he great.

"A MODEL INSTITUTION”

Recently a group of Grinnell students had the pleasure of visiting
an Iowa penal institution which we believe is unique. We refer to
the Women's notormatory at Rockwell City, which, under the capable
direction of superintendent, Miss E. Pauline~ Johnston. is doing an
outstanding job of reforming, rather than punishing, the girls scnt
there.

To one with the conventional picture of a penal institution in
mind, it is nothing short of astounding to drive through the gateway
to the reformatory grounds into an atmosphere resembling a school
rather than a prison. Everywhere one sees women in overalls and
blue dresses busy at their various duties, but nowhere is there any
sign of a guard. Each woman is treated as though she could be
trusted, and as a result they take great pains to live up to that trust.
Each girl is her own guard, and since the whole group losos recrea-
tional privileges in case of an attempted escape, the individual feels
that she must keep anyone from escaping.

This ideal attitude is made possible by the attitude of the staff,
each of whom feels that it is the duty of the institution to prepare
the girls for a useful place in the world. This result is accomplished
through classes in various useful arts, practical work on the farm,
and a number of cultural influences such as a fine library, classes in
current events and Bible study, asked for by the girls, and plenty of
wholesome recreation

Such a program and leadership requires good equipment for
maximum success, and it is fortunate that the Board of control of
state institutions has been farsighted enough to provide it. While
the institution is badly overcrowded, such facilities as they have are
very fine. The girls make their own dresses and overalls in a well-
equipped workroom, and get practical experience in housekeeping in
the kitchens and iaundries of the three cottages. The women opcrate
two farms, and the recreational facilities include a large building,
with a stage, used as a chapel, and for movies and other amuse
menu.

These few paragraphs cannot do justice to this valuable institu-
tion, for to appreciate the work being done one must see the place in
action.‘ We hope that more students will take advantage of its
proximity to familiarize themselves with a plan of reformation which
might well be applied to other penal institutions.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Speakers Declare
World Peace Needs

Active Interest

A plea for activc instead of pas-
sive interest in peace was made
Thursday evening by speakers at
the Grinnell peace rally. studying
the pxoblems-which are involved in
obtaining peace, educating the
public about facts of war, and
supporting democracy were among
the activitics suggested,

The rally, which was attended
by more than three hundred stur
dents, was sponsored by members
of the Gl'innell international Rev
lations group. Speakers included

Shelton L. Benny, Roger Nelson, ,

Miss Ollic Backus, John Spence,
and Prof. F. L. Baumann.

In urging the formation of study
groups which will concern theme
selves with the problems confront-
ing the peace movement, Miss
Backus suggested, "We should copy
the technique of the war propa-
gandists and give the people some
thing to do."

“You will not get peace by a
single movement alone,” Mr. Bau-
mann said in closing the meeting,
“Peace will come through indi-
viduals sacrificing- their selfish
desires and some of their precious
rights.”

The chapel program Thursday
morning was also sponsored by the
international Relations group and
Richard Pooley spoke, redefining
patriotism. Deuouncing cynicism
and apathy of citizens because
these lead to communism and war,
Mr. Pooley said, “If old men are
going to dream dreams, then
young men must have visions of
justice, equality and liberty, and
work for these ends." ‘
