AGAIN, A BEGINNING

Once more the SCARLET AND BLACK,
on behalf of the faculty and administration
of Grinnell college, bids welcome to the stu-
dent body~both to you who are entering
Grinnell for the first time, and to you who
are returning and who we all know so well.
For all of ossnew students and old students
alike—it is again a new beginning.

To the incoming freshman, who has left
behind him old friends, the experiences of
his high school days, and the activity and
environment of his former associations; to
the sophomore, who has put in the past the
memories of “Hell Week" and freshman re-
quirements; to the junior, who has now
passed the “middle line” and looks toward
a profession; and to the senior, who now
looks upon the past three years as a de-
cade and begins to analyze what he would
do “if he had it to do over again!”

If there are no regrets of the past, we are
glad; yet, if there are regrets, the past is
gone, there is yet time, and a new begin-
ning is on hand All students, new and old,
will start out this college year of 1938-39
with a clean slate and with bright hopes.
At Grinnell you will find all about you evi-
dences of leadership and organization With
a. student body centered within such a demo-
cratic institution, there can be nothing here
but a promising futureﬁnot four ends, but
four beginnings.

When the beginning is on hand it is time
to plan the beginning to work toward a suc<
cessful endiand there to begin again, To
quote from the editorial “Do It Now" in the
July 27 issue of the SCARLET AND
BLACK:

”Foresight is an essential factor in lead-
ership . . , You may get more benefit from
your college years if you will give of your
best and do it now. You are the men and

. women whose ideas are of importance to
Grinncll college, You are the ones who can
make Grinnell college better or worse, and
in so doing benefit or harm yourselves, For
Grinnell is nothing more or less than what
you make ‘5 . . . New problems are con-
stantly ari mg l , Those who are most
active in solving these problems will profit
most from their college years . . . There is
always room for those who can reach the
top. There is always a demand for leaders."

Foresight need not be applied to only
those who are entering college for the first

time, but also to those who have long been
here, froln the freshman to the senior The
opening of the senior year is as much a bc~
ginning as is enjoyed by the freshman or
the sophomore.

Again, we extend to you, the students
who make Grinncll possible, our hearticst
welcome. Whatever your college year, you
are this fall beginning again and will, if
you realize your position as anything but an
end, soon “join the select company of those
who lead!”

7G—
THE BAND NEEDS YOU!

Although the student body and the admin-
istration may have forgotten over the sum-
mcl' months the campaign begun last spring
to boost the Griunell college hand from an
obsolete organization to a pluce alllong the
important and highly recognizable groups
on the campus, this newspaper has not; and,
moreover, through its editor 1 columns, the
SCARLET AND BLACK will stick by its
platform pledge calling for band reorgani—
zation until such a time when the necessary
changes have been made and Grinncll’s band
can proudly take its place among the well
organized band units of other colleges

Mr. Robert S. Vagner, we welcome you
to Grinnell; and, knowing the problems with
which you are faced, we assure you of the
whole-hearted support of this newspaper in
any measures you may take as new director
of the college band to bring Grinnell's hand
once more into the respected place where it
rightfully belongs. But you cannot do this
alone. No mall in your position could do it.
You will need the support of the student
body and the administration, and that we
sincerely trust you shall have.

The Student Council last spring, follow-
ing investigation, submitted proposals to thl
faculty committee on student organization:
in which it urged credit toward graduation
for students participating in the college
band. Other proposals were also made, such
as the increasing of the band’s funds, the
purchasing of new uniforms, and means of
more efficient organization in the band. Un-
fortunately, as the proposals were under
consideration, work was cut short by the
ending of the college year. But the Student
Council has begun the fight; and now the
college itself must finish it!

However, the SCARLET AND BLACK is
not going to sit idly by this year, It is go»
ing to encourage further the adoption of the
Student Council’s proposals, for, not only
does it back the campus governing body 100
per cent, but it will not stand to see Grin-
nell slip backward A bond advertises a col-
lege or university for bad or for worse,
just as do the athletic teams, the college
newspaper, and the academic standing of
the institution,

The Student Council has started to do its
part. Now the college itself will be forced to
do its part—not only the administration
and faculty, but the students themselves.

The band needs you!

Under Mr. Vagncr this year, the organi»
zation will again take all active part ill
football and basketball games; and, in addi—
tion, plans are at present being discussed as
to the possibility of renewing band concerts
on the campus during the year as a part of
the college entertainment program.

But, in order to do this successfully, the
band needs players. Elsewhere in this issue
is a story announcing the first meeting of
the band Friday afternoon, We urge the re—
turn of all old band members who are back
to Grinnell; and, more than that, we advise
the enrollment in the band of all students
who play band instruments. Incoming
freshman men and women are asked at this
time to support the fight for a larger and
better college band by entering into the unit
at once. Your part is needed to help in the
action which this newspaper demands.

Grinncll needs a good band; and the band
needs you!

DORIC

A COLUMN OF PURE
BEAUTY

Well, here we or}: again—and
have been for some time. There’s
one thing about coming back to
school curly, even with its cold
showers, and that's that c tellow
can get his work arranged before
the preps arrive so as to have
more time to survey the new stuff
on the campus. And some of it
doesn‘t seem so bad!

The lnvoritc pnstime oi the
football boys, when they weren't
practicing the past week, has
been to check down the ever cur-
rent rumol-s about the relative
percentage of male and female on
the campus. Inasmuch as the Calir
rornic truck driver, L. K. Shep-
ord, has indicated that no is again
playing the field, the general opin-
ion is that there should be aspl’er
ponderance of “lcs jcunes fllles"
here to counterbalance his power.

Speaking of football, the team
wit has turned ollt to be Bill Par-
ringer, who is credited with the
famed quote that "Moehl is as
shifty as a polar bear.” And the
boys report that until Friday
night Pal‘llnger had been turning
his weight in as taken from the
metric scale:

part of him that he feels like a
canary let out of a cage.
However, he is still driving the
same jaloppy, and has adopted a
new theme song in honor thereof:
its “A tisket, a tasket, rve got

a leaky gasket."

Wonder it any of the new girls
have yet asked for permission to
sleep through breakfast? Or if
there was anybody dumb enough
to study for his English exam
and thereby fall into the “high
English“ group? or any prep
served so that an upperclassman
might pour? 0r failed to impress
