As thc founder and editor of “The

or .of a dozen books on government.
business and politics. former editor
of the “Minneapolis Tribune." educa-
tor and lecturer. Albert Show stands
higii among those Grinnell graduates
who have made truly important
placcs for themselves in world affairs.

His position is further indicated by
such facts as: that he was a member
of the arbitration board that settled
the differences between the eastern
railroads and locomotive engineers in
1912. president of the jury of awards.

dent of the American Poll cal Science

Board. a trustce of Grinnell college
and several other educational institu-
tions, fellow of the American Ge -
graphical society. the American H
torical association, and the Econom.
icztl association. .

Shows Education vltlue .

In the July 1932 issue of the “Rue
view of Reviews." Mr. Shaw ex-
pressed himself pointedly as to the
value of higher education for the
average young man and woman of to-'
day “suppress rather than develop"
the initiative of students. because
they pour the students into a set mold
and place too
teaching and not enough on learningl
Supplementing the ideas expressed in’
that article, he has written of his ex-
periences at Grinnell:

"I think a great many students
would do better to strike out and find
their own way in the world. rather
than spend four years in college. I
am ready, however. to make discrim-‘
inations. My own years at Grinnell
were not wasted. but were upon the
whole advantageous. This. however.
was not so much because of what
Grinnell did for me. as because of
what Grinnell did not prevent me
from doing for myself.

much emphasis on |

“I hope you read the foregoing sen-
tence ivith some care. 1 was allowed
to use my brains for my own benefit.
1 could write a small book upon the
advanuages that Grinnell afforded in
that period.

Handicapped students Few

“.r believe that the percentage of
Grinnell students who have been fatal-
ly handicapped in their future lives
by the fact of having spent several
years at college is notably small. On
ihc othcr hand. I believe that the
great majority of Grinnell graduates
have found it possible in after life to
make themselves feel that their years
at Grinnell had been of positive value
in a gieat many waysimost of them
not directly related to class room
walk.

"In short. I believe that Grinnell
has always been a college which knew
how. upon the whole. to help young
people go forward along independent
and responsible lilies."

Mr. Shaw was graduated from
Grinnell in 1879. received his degree
of A. M. here in 1882. and his Ph. D.
from Johns Hopkins in 1884. He con-
tinued his graduate studies in Europe.
Pcl‘tical science, especially municipal
government and international law
have been his field of research. A
dozen universities have conferred on
him the honorary degrees of LL. D.
and Litt, D.

would be unwise.

their act, financial difficulties should

mer years have been one of the nub
standing events on the college calen-
dar and I am very much in favor of
reviving them.

Josephine BiUlZIrz: I think the
Pruditics are a most important means
in stimulating originality. And. by
them. a greater number of students
who have not had the time or op-
portunity to take part in aromatics
will be given a chance to demonstrate
