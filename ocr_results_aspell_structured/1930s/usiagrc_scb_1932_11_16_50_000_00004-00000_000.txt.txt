Presidential Election Over, Collegians

Wonder What Result Means to Theni

(Special by College News Sen-ice)

Now that it's all over. college stu-
dents in all parts 0[ the country ale
wondering Just what they got out of
the election.

“ 'alllztble exitel'ience. principally “
say many observers. who walehc
with interest the nationwide st
vote conducted under the a spices of
The Daily Princetonian at Princeton
university.

Students Disappointed

Returns from this poll showed that‘

a large majority of students did not
get the candidate they preferred. hut
the number of ballots cast in the
straw vote, it is said, indicate a ncw
and healthy interest in national po-
litical affairs that ouguis well for
the futui

Returns from 641 colleges showed
President Hoover far in the lead. with

a total of 33.024 straw votes. as corn-|

pared to 19,973 for Roosevelt and 11.-
089 for Thomas. Only colleges and
universities ill the South gave Rooses
.velt a heavy majority vote.

Offer Explanations

Since the total letul'ns.
failed to reflect the official vote cast
by the people on election day, many
explanations are being offeredimost
of them unsatisfactory.

Democrats are inclined to maintain
that the student vote simply express~
ed a. profound admiration and re-
spect for a man under fire, but fail-
ed to recognize issues and to analyze
the principles at stake.

0n the other hand, Republicans
point to the heavy college vote for
Hoover as an indication of a more in.
telligent and careful analysis of the
administration’s policies and a clear
or recognition of the soundness of
these'policies than that reﬂected by

however. ,

the popular vote. Because college Stun
l‘dents stopped to think, because they
iwel'c net snaiyed by emotional ap-
pcals, Republican leaders contend.
.they voted for the president, instead
,of Roosevelt. '

Without attempting to ieconcih:

lpoll were announced, many or ice
claimed that the vote merely proved
‘that college students are ulna-com
servative, reactionary, and opposed to
‘change . . that the students form a
.sheltered. cloistercd group. largely
lsupported by parents, and with little
,‘or no conception of finance, econom-
‘icS or politics.

“In contrast to the college students
the American people were drawn to
the Democratic candidate to a great
extent because of his promise of ‘u
new deal! "

New York Analysis

A few days before the election. the
lNew York University Daily News ale
so attempted to analyze the results
of the collegiate poll. Commenting
on the fact that southern colleges
were practically the only apparent
Roosevelt supporters, the News
stated:

“These results indicate that thel
college student is not independcuti
in a class by himself. He is a pro-
duct of his environment just as much
as the average uneducated man in
,tbe street. It would appear that we
‘are too optimistic, perhaps, in assum
‘ing that education is such a power-
ful factor in moulding the opinions of
_the individua '
