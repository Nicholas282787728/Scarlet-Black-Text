And the Blucjays face a gigantic;
task at stillwater, Okla, when they'
face the Cowboys, judging from thei

to Drake last wcek. Boasting fourl
straight conference victories against;

Cowboys Have Tough Job

 

AS a consequence Oklahoma A. at;
M. racked up its first victory in de-i
fense of its championship and needs
only a. victory over Creighton to-
day to retain the title. The CowV
boys, however, have a tough job
on their hands in beating the Blue—I
jay team which last week outplayed
Marquette throughout but lost on a

tumble in the final minutes of play,

14 to 9.

Should Creighton spill the Aggies,
Drake would win the title unless the,
Bluejays should schedule and win ai
contemplated Thanksgiving Day»
game with Butler. In that case the
Nebraskans and the Iowans would.
tie for the crown with four victoricsl
and a. single setback.

pioneers to Fight

Unless negotiations are completed‘
between Butler and Creighton, the
Indiana Bulldogs arc through for the

' season. Fritz Mackey‘s boys ran afoul
of Washington Saturday and thcl
Bears chalked up their first valley
triumph in a high scoring game, 361
to 12.

Drake and Grinncll meet Saturday
for the second time this year, the
Bulldogs having won the first en-
counter at Des Moines by a two-
touchdown margin. The pioneers, who
tied Haskell last week in the first
game of the season in which they
were not defeated, could make the
season a success for themselves, at
least. by evening matters with their
old cncmiesin the game today at
Grinncll. It Will end the campaign for
Grinncll.

today with the traditional battle
