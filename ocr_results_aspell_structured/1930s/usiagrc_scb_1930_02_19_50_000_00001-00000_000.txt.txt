' Meyer Shoots Needed Basket
Forty Seconds Before
Final Gun.

Ruff is High Scorer

Overtime Period is Needed When
Game Ends in Tie Score
17-17.

"Moose” (Meyer has done his bit for
Washington university basketball in
the last three years, but probably, in
all of his Missourian history. he has
never meant quite so much to Coach
Don White as he did last Saturday
evening just forty seconds before the
close of the ﬁrst overtime period in
the Grinnell-Washington basketball
game. Washington won, 19 to 17,
which, with the above statement
practically completes the tale.

The game got under way with all
the marks of a battle royal and in
the effort to calm the affair, the of—
ﬁclals called fouls on all sides. Mc-
Creary of Grinnell was the greatest
victim of the wholesale calling of the
personals. getting three chalked up
before the contest was well under
way. The affair slowed into a has-
ketball game after the ﬁrst ﬁve min-

; utes and from that time on it was
the St. Louis’ Blues for the Pioneers.
Pioneers Tie Score

Douglas opened the scoring of tbe
day with a neat whirling shot but the
Bears came right back and took a
6 to 2 lead. They held the advant-
age for the rest of the period and at
half time led, IDAto e.

The second half started out in the
Same fashion and in six minutes the
Bears ran the lead to 14 to 6. Four
minutes later, however, they woke up
suddenly to ﬁnd that.the home outs
ﬁt had deuced the count at 147311.
The Pioneers closed the game with a
brand of ball which clearly outclass-
ed the visiting defense, but shot after
shot rolled against the iron rim of

-tbe basket. only to fall in going
hrougb.
Meyer Makes Basket

The close of the contest found the
score tied at 17 and 17. The over-
time period again looked like Grin-
neil would eventually win, but effort
after effort to hit the hoop went
away and when Moose Meyer slip-
ped one in with only forty seconds to
go it meant defeat for the Scarlet
and Black.

Ruff was the main cog of the Plo—
neer offense and proved the individuA
al star of the game with a total of
seven points. Douglas played his
usual consistant game for the Plo-

. neers, holding the touted Meyer to
three points in the regular game, and
McCreary proved capable after being
sent in during the second half.
Sausselle and Meyer were the out-
standing Washington stars.

Dates Legal

Dates will be legal all day next Sun-

made today by Fern Teget, president

SIGMA DELTA CE].
Sigma. Delta Chi will meet tomor-
row noon at the Varsity Tearoom

Important changes liberalizing the
rules regarding minute penalties will
go into effect at the quadrangle im-
mediately, it was decided today,
when all four classes had accepted
the revised rules, which were pro-
posed by Dean Luella Read, accept-
ed by the Women's League board,
and presented to the senior and jun-
ior girls last night, to thc sopho~
mores and freshmen today.

Miss Reed gave as one of the rea-
sons in initiating the changes the
fine spirit of cooperation in living up
to the rules which had prevailed at
the quadrangle this year, which she
declared was the best spirit the girls
at the quadrangle had manifested
since she had been here. She also
feels that it is only right that a sells
ior girl should have additional priv-
ileges.

Colonial Ball is

Liberalized Rules on Minute Penalties ,
Go lnto Effect at Quadrangle at Once

Under the new system, which will
be an cxperiment until spring vaca-
tion. the same closing hours at the
quadrangle arc to be maintained,
the number of minutes allowed the
four classes is to be cut in two, but
the girls will not be subject to near-
ly as strict penalties from the League
board, if. after using up their min-
utes, they occasionally get to the
quadrangle a few minutes after clos~
ing time. For seniors and juniors
the provisions are even more liberal.

Senior girls, under the new rules,
will have thirty minutes instead of
sixty, But if, after using up their
minutes, senior girls wish to remain
out now and then up to fifteen min
utes after closing time. no minutes
will be counted against them, and no
excuses will have to be given to Miss
Read or to the League board. It is
not defined, how many nights a week
a senior may take this privilege, but
it is understood that as long as she
does not abuse the right, no questions
will be asked her.

Must Present, Excuses.-

Junior girls are allowed the same
privilege, with the exception that
they will be required to furnish an
excuse upon entering the quad late,
after their minutes have been used
up. According ,to Miss Read, how-
ever, the rule will be liberal here, and
if a girl returns late from a picture
show. such an excuse, for example,
will suffice. 1f juniors do not get
excuses for staying out beyond the

Barrere Brings
Orchestra Here

Little SymphonyGroquives
Remarkable Concert

Monday Night.

The Barrere Little Symphony or-
chestra of New York gave a concert
in Herrick chapel Monday evening,
under the auspices of the School of
Music. The orchestra, traveling
from a completed engagement in
Kansas City to play in Minneapolis,
offered to play here in the interven-
ing night. Despite the exceedingly
short notice, a fairrsized crowd heard
the concert. and judged it to be one
of the outstanding musical treats of
the year.

This orchestra, one of the most
noted of its kind in the world, is
composed of fourteen pieces; its
founder and conductor is Georges
Barrere, formerly a member of the
New York Symphony orchestra. We
print below a short review of the
program played here Monday eve-

Home its Vim?!
Battle Drake
Here Friday

Early Ratings Give Pioneers
Slight Edge in Final
Home Tilt.

B a t t l e is Forecast

McCreary, Douglas, Ruff, DeLong
and Humphrey Will Probably
Start as Lineup.

After being well out of the con-
ference race by a three point mar-
gin, one to Creighton and two to
Washington, the Grinnell basketeers
will tackle an age—old athletic rival
here Friday night in the final home
game of the season. Drake is sched-
uled to appear at the Pioneer gym<
nasium to determine whether the
steadily improving game of the
Grinnellians or the in and out affairs
which they have shown shall prove
superior.

Grinnell, by defeating Drake ear
her in the season and holding Wash—
ington university to a narrow margin
last week, has earned a slight mar-
gin in advance ratings. The earlier
Drake game was an overtime con~
test, however. and the Bulldogs for—
ced the Pioneers to go the limit for
victory. Drake pulled a.sur-prise a,
fortnight ago when she trimmed
Washington but the Bears romped
over the Des Moines outfit with lit—
tle trouble Monday night.

The Pioneer squad rested Monday
and received a light work out against
the yearlings Tuesday afternoon.
They are due for heavy duty the
rest of the week. however. coach
Truesdale will probably start his
regular lineup with McCreary and
Douglas at guards, Humphrey at
Center and DeLong and Ruff at the
forward berths. Drake is likely to
show Lynn King and Bowes at for-
wards, Schultz at center and Mona—
han and Barnes at the guards.

Heywood is Elected ,
to Lead Freshmen

Members of the freshmen class at-
tended a dinner given in the quad-
rangle last Monday evening. Fill-
more Gwynne-vaughn, retiring pres~
ident, presided.

Miss Read gave a short talk on
“Expectation", and Mr. Beatty spoke
briefly on “Leadership". Gene
Grounds, Ethel Foltz and Esther
Griffith entertained with a number of
songs.

Following the dinner, an election
of officers for the second semester
was held. The result was as fol<
lows: President, Kathryn Heywood:
vicerpr'esident, George Van No-
strand; social chairman, Ruth De-
Long and Robert Adams; treasurers,

of a conference with President
Main. the action comes on the

Frosh Cagers
Lose to Tutors

Lead Until Last Minutes,
When Pedagogs Rally
to Win, 36-29.

The Olson—Sherman — Formcnack
combination. which two years ago
carried Teacher High to the finals of
the state high school basketball tour—
nament, proved too strong for the
Grinnell yearlings at the State
Teachers college Monday night and
the locals were downed by the Tutor
frosb cagers, as to 29.

Playing without Duncan. the preps
lost the lead early in the game when
Olson. stellar Tutor forward started
the fireworks, but pulled together
and were leading at the half, 16 to
14. Olson made 12 of the 14 Tutor
points in the first half. The second
half was a different story, however,
and thehome outfit pulled steadily
into the lead. The game was still in
the balance in the last few minutes
when Brawer, along shot artist took
the floor for the Pedagogs, and lo-
cated tbe basket four times to give
his team a substantial lead.

The frosh will play at Cornell next
Saturday afternoon and the follow~
ing Friday night will meet the Drake
freshmen here.

Olson was the outstanding star of
the Monday game with 15 points to
his credit wbile James led the Pio—
neer youngsters with 12 markers.
