WHY NOT BOTH SIDES?

Students come to college to learn facts. Thcy
get them, in cd with propaganda, Pllhlic utility

few years ago. Studcnt newspapers regular

taristic associations, world peace movements
road associations, and any number 015 add lonal
groups desiring to impress something upon the stu-
dent mind.

Griillllcll students are victims of an even more
definite attempt to curl) original thought on cur
rent top , Silently and with that stolid student
spirit of mediocre o_ 'cclncilt, which was cl ticl' d
by Ruth Sllckow last year, they have submitted to
this treatment and they watch its advance with
wondering alld cvcn commending cycs. Inertia is
their god.

The Chicago Tribune was taken from the li-
brary. Its news and editorial policies were not
thought to he of the sort with which the academic
mind should be given contact. Yet, thc'suhs )tion

A QUESTION OF ATTITUDE
(From the Cornellinn)

Recently made surveys of the intercollegiate press
have shown lthat the majority of college papers are
censored. A censored paper as an undergraduate organ
of thought is valueless. A censored paper can not ch
press honest opinion. The value of an uncensored paper
has been shown in the football reforms effected by the
student paper, The Spectator, at Columbia university.
With a censored paper these reforms would nut have
been possible, l

Fortunately, The Cornellian is not censored, but
like most college papers it does have to contend with
an administration suspicious of its every move. even to
the misreading of satires.

Just why administrations are always suspicious of
undergraduate newspapers is a mystery. The editors
of these student papers are always working for tho
betterment of their schools. If they were not it is not
likely that they would have been selected. The editor
of no college paper is so foolish as to think that a
school can exist without an administration, nor does
he think that an administrotion's every act is foolish.
Editors know that the presidents of colleges and unis
versities are sincerely working to the best of their
powers to better their indivi ual schools. Editors also
know that sometimes administrations have to reckon
with boards of trustees and alumni bodies.

Why must college paper aways be regardep with
suspicion when both parties hold a common aimia
better school? Is it because the opinions expressed in
the editorial columns of student newspapers do not
always agree with those held by the administration?
There are always at least two opinions on every subject
or question, To deny that there can he no more than
one opinion is to be dogmatic; to enforce the denial is
tyranny. college newspapers are not anti-social.

WINCHELLIZING
(From the Marquette Tribune)

There has been much comment and a deal of une
necessary attention laid at the door of Mrs. Winchclrs
boy Walter for his possible effect on the English longs
uage. Mr. Winchell has been entertaining for some time
by means of newspapers and the radio, and, according
to a. recent news article, nearly 40 college editors
worried themselves sick that the Winchell style might
find its way into the speech and writing of a large part
of the country

Our language has long been bothered by slang. For
our American youth is a lively race, living in a fast
age and continually “bouncing end barging about" for
no palpably good reason. And it has a natural reaction
in our speech and should he expected to have in our
writing, although it doesn't7 xcept for notable instan-
ces, such as our presentrunder-d cussion Mr. Winchell.
Slang has added a certain peppering-up to the language.
It contains the main difference between ordinary United
states and formal English.

"English as she is spoke” by Mr. Winchell is the
degeneration of slang. It hasn’t. any more refinement
than a speakeasy. But that it will have an effect on
the language may he strenuously doubted, although, of
course, only the future can prove that definitely. As
yet it hasn‘t. exerted any widespread influence, at least
not here at Marquette. When students rarely do use
it. They are conscious that it is still Winchellism: and
they feel as though they're quoting, not thinking origins
ally. Its author is known as "America's greatest gossip,”
and youth, though it likes to bear and repeat gossip
is always careful to mention the source.

HOW TO PREVENT CREATING
(From the Centre Colonel)

1. Students will march to class under guard of
Danvillc's police equipped with sawed off shotguns.

2. Will be stopped at doorway and searched for
contraband notes, etc.

3, Before entering classroom each student will be
submitted to psychological examination to determine
whether or not he has any idea of cheating.

4, Classrooms will be decorated with such notes as

5. Each student must wear blinders and place a
handkerchief in his mouth.

6. Students and professors will enter together and
the doors will be locked and sealed,

7. Students will sit two seats apart with professors
standing- between each two students. Professors will be
armed with blackjacks to.inspire rcspcct.

3. Additional professors on the outside wul watch
through pccpholes in the well.

9. Highly tunerl dictaphones will be concealed be—
hind the pictures to catch the slightest whisper.

10, When the student has finished his examination
a, lie detector will be used to find out whether or not he
has cheated.

11. In marking the papers, professors will discount
ten points from each paper on the possibility that the
student has cheated.
