MERRILL DEBATE

The filial Merrill debate on the
question, Resolved: That the pres
eut administration should not he
returned to power, is to be held
Monday night‘the night before
election.

Back in 1911, when Mr. George
W'. Merrill provided a substantial
sum, the interest from which was
to be used for yearly prizes to
the Winning Merrill debate team,
he asked that in election years
the final debate should be held
the night before Presidential elec-
tion.

The purpose of the founder of
these awards was to interest col-
lege men ill practical politics, and
to Stimulate discussion on the po-
litical que. ions of the day. Mr.
Merl-ill wished to t r a i ii
men to speak well ill public on
politics.

and the thrill of college life. What is
glorious four years to look forward
to. There is something about the
time spent at college that will al-
wsys be remembered along with such
other events as c long trip to a far
country. your first cirplcuc ride, and
your first good job.

College is full of various types of
personalities, the some as you will
find when you get out and become
just another person in that great
mass, the public. Why tie yourself
down to the one person and shut
yourself off from the hundreds of
other: whom you are attending class
with? Yes, this is intended as a, word
of advice, to freshmen especislly, in
regard to dating. Too many times
those who meet someone the early
part of their college life tie them-
selves down to that one person and
find at the end of college that: thc
onc-and-only up and marries someone
else. Not that you should refrain
from dating the same person more
than once, but do not limit your cc-
quaintance to one person. 0. U. is
full of individuals who want to have
is good time and are the most inter-
esting people to know.

By widening your circle of friends
you will increase the variety of per—
sonalities to study. Make a study of
your friends and pick out the traits
which help or hinder their personal
progress in the making of new
friends. The study will prove most in-
teresting: your friends will come to
mean more to you and in the end you
will be enriched by a, deeper under-
standing cf the joy and Sorrow and
action of those with whom you must

Thursday

Ted Schultz, national secretary of
the Young Men’s Christian associa-
tion, spoke in chapel on the concept
of the Student Christian movement
and its function.

“The Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W.
c. A. are based on a belief that life
Carl believe and society organized on
the principles which Jesus set forth,"
he said. “These principles, which in-
Clude coopcration, service and broth—
erhood, will become real insofar as
they are incorporated in our persousl
attitude."

the Pioneer Chest drive. She explaim
ed that it is organized to provide
funds for the Young Men’s and

‘ functions of all three in college life.

Campus Opinion

Should Stags and cut ins be allow-
ed at the collegc dances?

Eloise Brown: 1 think stag dances
are fun. Perhaps they are not as nice
as they might he for the fellows, but
they certainly help the girls haw c
good time.

Frank Johnson: Stags are all right
in their place, but their place isn’t
at most of the ccllegc dances. i think
that they should be allowed to cut
at open houses and at the Wednesday
night dcnccs but absolutely not at
varsities. More ted dances should be
given, and Stags should be welcome
at them.

Mary June Miller: i feel that: it is
not fair to a. fellow to have other
fellows dance with the girl whose
Way he has paid to the varsity. Also
when the men can go stag, less girls
have dates. However more afternoon
dances should be held with as many
Stags there as care to come.

Catherine Co Dances with Stags
are objectionable to some people be-
cause many fellows dislike to have
other fellows dance with their girls.
However I think a few Stags now
and then help any party.
