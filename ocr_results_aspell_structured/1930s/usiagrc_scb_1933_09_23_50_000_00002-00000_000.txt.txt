”TAKING Tim RAP”

For the past few years, in spite- of storm
clouds on other college campuses, Grinncll has
managed to keep its enrollment within easy reach
of what it had been in the past. Scholarships, col-
lege jobs, loans, and faculty cooperation made this
possible. .

This year, in spite of all uptrend in business
and general conditions, Grinnell has "taken a rap”
in enrollment. Just why tllis should happen in the
term 1933-34 instead of during the darker ages of
1930 to 1933, only the more notable economists,
perhaps, would know. It may he that when times
were at their worst, parents alld students believed
it their duty to keep on ill Spite of all opposing
forces. There was no work for youllg persons, ally-
way, and college seemed the logical place for them
to be.

Positions are opening now. Some of the young
lnell alld women wllo might be ill college are work-
ing instead. Some of the parents, perhaps, who
have been sacrificing during the past few years,
feel that it is time for their children to repa, them
ill part. Again, perhaps, with many other schools
inaugurating c perative dormitories and student
self-help ideas, n addition to cutting all expenses,
Grinllell publi relation workers have found it a
hard ta. to com" lce students and parents of the
superiority of a G nllell education

Ill spite of this drop ill enrollment, however.
Grillnell will continue to forge ahead. As President
Nollcn has pointed ollt ill his Several puhlishctl are
ticlcs this summer, the liberal arts college has a
definite place under the sun, botll for preparation
for one’s life work and preparation for onc’s leir
sure time, incre. ing as scientific production less»
ens man’s wor ‘ng day.

HELLO, FRESHMEN

\Yclcomc to Grilulell, freshlncnl You are a hit
bewildered ight now. but you seem n more hlasc
alld soph' ticatcd lot than has appeared on the
campus in some of the past years. You are re 'eil'—
ing advice from all sides, too. some of which you
are heedillg; some of which you will pass by, Your
house officers, your faculty advis ' , your cla. i
structol‘s, the administrative nfflccl , 'lntl spec'
eally, your clas in orientation, are endoavoriug to
teach you the traditions, the taboos, the “do’s”
and ”floll’ts” of Grinnell college.

Far be it from The Scarlet and Black to give
you advi c during these flrst f w days. However.
here's a tip. Be observant with your eyes and on
-—2lnd not too talkative, Your opinions are very
good ones, no doubt, so weigh everything you hear
and see very carefully. Yet, keep your rca
yourself for a little whileisay several w .
even in that short tilllc perhaps your idea. may
change. If they don‘t you may consider that they
were very good idczls, indeed.

5 when the home team is in a bad spot. In future
contests, this should be remembered. “School sp

such crucial moments.

A little practice on cheering and cheer lead-

NRA DEFEATS THE NIE‘TZSCHEANS

Friedrich Nietzsche was an anarchist. He be-
lieved that the really great men make up their own
code of morals, ill spite of the morality of the
hard. the common people, Out of his burning brain,
the German philosopher concocted 3 Superman, all
uhermensch, who (lured to declare: “What is good
for my own interests I call ‘good’ and ‘virtuo and
Wllitt is bad for lile I call ‘cvil’ and ‘sin.’ " fiel-
having made a l'enlﬂl‘l’ and original contribu-
tion to world thought, tzschc died, hopelessly
insane. »

Howcv - admirable and strong his philosophy
may sound, it has proved the downfall of the very
ind 'idualists who have practiced it. Our unbridled
capitalists of the past have been, ill a scnsc, Nietzs-
cheans, economic supermen who thought they
could freely subvert natural resources and human
lives for their own interests. The NRA has denied
tllcm this, forcing upon them the morality and iii-
terests of the social whole,

The economic superlnen have been jungle men
with jiulgle ethics, let loose ill a civilized Communi-
ty. Having intl-cnched themselves, they set up
shop and ruthlessly exploited their fellowuien and
the materials of life for their own purses. Our More
galls, Rockefellcrs, Fords, alld Mcllons have been
to some extent, the Nietzschcans of America, and
for a tinlc have held supreme reign, It is the NRA
which has defeated their aims and has compelled
them, at least for the near futLlre, to recognize that
the social good will be the ideal of American gov-
ernmellt.

A LEADERSHIP FORMULA
(The ConegeEye)

“You are going into the world to be its leaders"
would make an excellent one sentence brief of nearly
every graduation speeeh that was ever delivered either
to a high school or college graduation class. To the
man really interested in making himself a leader the
question, "what qualities are required for leadership".
immediately pops into his mind. But most graduation
speakers, either due to an oversight or to the fact
that they are unable, fail to give the supposedly secret
or hidden fornnula wherein dwells the “open sesame”
of leadership. ,

According to James Truslow Adams, who has
written his formula for success in The New York
Times magazine, a summary of which is carried in
the August issue of the Reade"s Digest; a genuine
leader must (1) “have some definite ideas which, whether
right or wrong, seem light to use” and, (2) "they must

be clearrcut and related to underlying principles or '

to some philosophy of life," It would seem strange
that these factors are ranked first by Mr. Adams.
but, as he explains it, the personal self must be suborar
inated to the idea or ideal if real leadership is to be
present.

He proceeds by seyng, "A leader must hold his
beliets with eonfidenee, must not veer with eveiy wind,
every man he talks with, every pressure brought upon
him." This quality is rather selt explanatory as are
the others which follow: “No man can be ti leader
who does not possess courage. A leader must also
possess a certain idealism, a vision of what might be.
Lastly, there is that indefinable quality which we call
personality, whieh seizes the imagination of the people."

A close examination will reveal the difficulty which
faces the average college graduate who plunges out

into the “cruel, eold world” and attempts to apply the 7

foregoing formula in order to demonstrate his qualities
of leadership, He may expect to he laughed at, ‘ndicllled
and ousted. At least that is the thought of the practical
minded individual who sees the idealism contained in
Adams is alert to the ever changing world and the
increasing difficulty of applying the formula He pro-

ceeds to explain that our government is being run more v'

and more by the sercalled ”pressure groups” such as
the AntlrSaJCon League, and the Crusaders; that the

age of the corporation has tended to sup courage and "
independence in business and professional life, and that ‘

the ever—increasing standard of living has made money
the sole yardstick of success.

“Yet we by no means need despair," he concludes,
“the heart of the nation is still sound, and there is a
lot of thinking going on.”
