A UTOPIAN SUGGESTION

An interesting suggestion was made by
Pierre de Lanux, League oi Nations otticial, in
his address Monday evening on “The League oi

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Nations.” In essence he proposed that the
United States make a declaration to the world
at large that any wariarc, regardless of whether
or not the United States was directly involved,
would be regarded by America as an “unfriendly”
act, or one “inimical” to the welfare oi the Amer»
ican people.

Referring to the Monroe Doctrine, Mr. Lanux,
pointed out that in 1821 the American president
had issued a general pronouncement, which with—
out making any specific threat, had caused the
nations of Europe to refrain from invading the
Western Hemisphere, or when they did, had
served as an effective means of securing the
abandonment of any imperialistic schemes which
they might have had in mind.

While it is true that the Monroe Doctrine was
successtul in regard to the Western Hemisphere, it
does not follow that a similar indefinite uttere
ance made in regard to the entire world would
be successful as well. In the one case, Ameri—
ca was definitely involved, and the government
was fairly certain oi the Whole-hearted support of
the American people. On the other hand, the
government could be almost as equally sure of
pot getting the support of the people in an at—
tempt to enforce—and probably by physical
meansAa world wide peace doctrine, It does
not mean that the American people are not in»
terested in peace, but rather that they are not
in iavor of becoming so deeply involved in for-
eign affairs

America on a least two occasions backed up
the Monroe Doctrine with a display of force#
namely in the 1860’s when Napoleon III was in—
vading Mexico, and then later in the same cen-
tury in the Venezuela episode. Undoubtly a
display of force would be necessary at some time
to make the proposed declaration anywhere near
valid, and more than likely a conflict would en-
sue in which America would lose far more than
she would gain, The United States made “the
world safe for democracy” once, but “never
again!”

Perhaps, the declaration might convince the
world of America’s desire to cooperate for world

peace, but as a practical means of achieving
peace, the proposal is Utopian.

THE LAUGHING JOURNEY by
Thomas Lennon, If you enjoy the

ground of late by the emergence oi
the modern Irish realists, "The Laugh.
ing Journey" awaits you. “The Laugh.
ing Journey" is lite, and the one who
laughs, in this case, is Shane Erskine,
leader of an irish rebellion which
failed. The story oi Shane's lite and
of his love for Rosaleen Fair is told
by his father, who is living out his
old age on a tire department pension
in San Francisco? The main action
is laid in Ireland.

Who ever loves adventures, or a
tight, wit, romance, and idealism, will
be intrigued with this Irish story by
Thomas Lennon. It lairly teams with
laughter, io‘y. tears, and high romance,
It never departs Irom being thoroughly
celuc in its whimsical mood. It you
like Donn Byrne’s style, Thomas Len.
non has written a book you will want
