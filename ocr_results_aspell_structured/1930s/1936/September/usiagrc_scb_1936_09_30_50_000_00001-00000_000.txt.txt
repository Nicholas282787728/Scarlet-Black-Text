Squad Will Show

Improvement

By Dick Corlett

In spite of the loss of Fred Lu-
ther, promising sophomore half-
back, out with a. dislocated collar-
bone, and Dnyl Evans, veteran
tackle, out with a dislocated knee.
Coach Guy Lookahaugh said yes-
terday he felt confident that the
team he starts Saturday afternoon
will be the best one to represent
Grinneil this year.

Feeling pleased with the im-
provement made this week by his
proteges, the Grinnell mentor is
hoping to see his tam surprise the
Iowa state Teachers eleven, which
last week came into state gridiron
prominence by holding the Iowa
state college Cyclones to e scorer
less tie,
Forecast Difficult

Though little can be forecast as
to the offensive ability of the Tu-
tors, their uphill fight against a
stronger state team showed them
to be powerful defensively, and
their ability to consistently punt
out of danger through kicking of
both Magovich and Gnagy may
may make them as powerful of-
fensively as defensively. The game
last week between the two state
schools resulting in a puntlng duel
between the Tutor toe artists and
he renowned Cyclone offensive duo
of Poole and Neal. The teachers
resorted to punts 23 times and the
Cyclones 19.
