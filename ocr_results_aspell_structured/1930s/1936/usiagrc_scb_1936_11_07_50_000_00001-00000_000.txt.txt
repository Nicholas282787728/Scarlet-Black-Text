Defeat Reserves
Friday Afternon

13-6

Flashing a surprising reversal of
form after their defeat by the
Cornell frosh last week, the Pie-
neer freshman team beat the val--
sity reserves by a 13-6 score, yes-
terday after-noon.

The star of the game was Bob
Jones, former all-state center
with Davenport High, who scored
all the freshman points. Jones,
who stood out in the line on the
defense, snagged a varsity pass in
the first quarter and returned it 78
yards for a touchdown, behind
some good blocking by his mates.
In the second half, he was moved
to the backfield, and scored from
the one-yard line after the fresh
had recovered a fumbled punt and
had driven it, mostly through the
efforts of the same Mr. Jones,
within scoring distance, The 2101
pound center then placekicked the
goal for the point after touchdown.

Thc varsity touchdown came
early in the second quarter when
Wallace passed to Willard White
from the 2U~yard line for the
marker. Stiles’ attempt at a
placekick was spoiled by a bad
pass from center.

House presidents, at the weekly
meeting of the organization Thurs
day night.
