PRINCETON, N. J. (American
student Union). A fortnight ago
Lewis Gorln, Jr. was an unknown
and unheralded junior at Princeton
university.

Today he confesses that he is
the author of “the biggest pub-
licity stunt since the World War"
~the Veterans of Future Wars.

In an office above a restaurant
on Nassau street, main thorough-
fare of Princeton, Gorin finds him.
self the center of a deluge of mail,
wires, visitors, tesn‘fying to his
overnight leap into the public spot—
light. 1 -

, He is astonished, bewildered ——
. and, I suspect, uneasy.
Claim 122 Colleges

The Veterans of mature Wars,
formed to demand payment of the
bonus “before we're dead" has
reputedly spread to 122 colleges —
(that is Gorin’s claim.) A ladies
Auxiliary has been started. The
press has devoted columns of pub»
licity and photographs. The
‘Mnrch of Time' has dramatized
the movement. And hundreds of
students are asking: Is this serious
husiness Is it a stunt which will
vanish when the press wearies of
it? Are there anyi political
strings attached, Is this part of a
Republican crusade against “gov-
eminent spending“? Is it‘streight
pacifism'! Or, as a Hearst re—
porter who visited here shortly be-
fore me asked, is this more “Mos
cow" plotting?

After conferring with leaders of
the movement and studying reports
from other sections of the country,
the following observations may be
made:

The movement started as sheer
burlesque. Its founders are Demo-
crats who are opposed to the bonus
and wanted to satirize What they

 

call the "veterans grab," Only in-
cidentally did they view the move
as anti-war propagandaicertainly
never more than implied pacifism.

Suddenly they discovered that
their project was sweeping the
country. It was seized by students
as an opportunity to debunk the
glories of war. In most cases
those who are carrying the move
along in local colleges are mainly
interested in satirizing Wariand

only incidentally, if at all, in at:

tacking the bunus.

The leaders discover that they
have created what is more domi-
nantly an anti-war organization
than an anti-bonus gesture. I
don't believe they enjoy that dis-
closure, although some of them in-
sist that they_are pacifists in ad—
dition to being foes of the bonus.

Now they are faced with the ne-
cessity of deciding on policy. Al-
though the stunt was an overnight
sensation, the fever is subsiding.
Everyone asks an embarrassing
query: What will you do next?

Have No Program

They don't know. Their leaders
do not want to join with student
anti-war organizationsin carrying
on the nationwide strike for peace.
They won't ally themselves with
any existing student organization.

They won't draft any program
beyond the satirical demand for
the bonus.

But the bonus issue can't keep
them alive forever—especially since
the bonus has been safely voted by
congress. The leaders know that.
They are worried about it. They
are searching for new “stunts" to
keep the organization alive.

Who Finances Them?

Who finances them?

Although the American Veter-
ans associationi extreme right-
wing of the veterans — is closely
identified with the group, I don't
believe there is a financial connec-
tion. That would be indiscreet.
The students are being equally cau-
tious. certainly, however, enemies
of the bonus like the Veterans as-
sociation are pushing the organi-
zation.

Its leaders don’t7 and probably
won’tiknaw what to do. They
are scanning the front pages. They

wili do anything, i suspect, to keep
themselves there. They W'lll finally
yield to pressure—from one side
or another.

They deny any fascistic tenden-
cies. They deny any attempt to
ridicule strident anti~war activities,
although the movement is being
used in some places with that oh-
)ective. They deny servitude to
any reactionary group.
