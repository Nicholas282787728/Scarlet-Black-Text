OF WHAT VALUE? .
Now, with the recent political campaign and'presl-

dential election still fresh ill our minds, is a good tune to

speculate on the value of the electoral college system.

As it was originally conceived, the electoral college
system was designed to put the election of the president
in the hands of men of intelligence and superior political
experience. The body of the people had no other functlon
than to appoint the electors. Since that time, however,
the body of the people have come to takea more active
part in political affairs, and American‘polltlcal theory has
changed so that now it is a l‘ecognlzed fact that m a
democratic system, such as ours, it is essential that the
selection of various elective officials, including- the presl—
dent, should be dependent on the will of the people.

As a result, the electoral college system has become
outmoded. The electors in each state are instructed to
Vote for the candidate carrying the state, and they have no
other choice. The original principle, that the election
should be in the hands of persons specially qualified for
the work, has been discarded.

In view of this fact, it seems obvious that the elec-
toral college system should be discarded in favor of a
system of direct popular election. It is obvious that such
a system is really in effect at the present time anyway,
and that no radical change would be made; we would
merely eliminate a useless, expensive, and time wasting
process in between the actual popular election and the
inauguration of the president. ’

, At the same time, the abandonment of the present
system would eliminate the possibility of the election of
a minority president. It is conceivable, and, as a matter
of fact, the situation has occlllred once, that a man with
a minority of the popular vote should receive a majority
of the electoral vote and be named president of the
United States. If this situation were to occur again, it
would be an obvious injustice, inasmuch as the will of the
people would not have been observed, thus violating the
first principle of our democratic system of government.

Logically then the electoral college should be abol-
ished. ~VV.H.B.

In addition, the new system
provides that the budget director

shall receive their fees directly

cent will be set aside for the use

being established for the purpose

hall projects,

Plans Incomplete

“Plans {01‘ the use of the money
in tnc general fund have not been
completed as yet," Mr. Nelson ox-
plalned yesterday, "but we hope
to use the money for inter-hall
smokers, to bring to the campus
pmminent speakers who will be
able to present various topics to
the men, and perhaps to cooperate
on a joint project sponsored by
both the men‘s council and the
women's social budget committee.”

Each hall will be required to
contribute between $15 and $20
each semester to the general
fund, according to the tentative
figures given by the Council's spe»
cial committee. The fund will
consist 0f approximately $280 per
year, plus whatever money is sc-
cured from the 20 per cent of the
fees which is usually collected
late.

The social fees will be divided in
the following manner, according
to the toms of the program:
"First, all halls, including Macy
and Carney bousm and the town
men's organization, will constitute
units or apportionment, Second,
division of the fee shall be made
on a percentage basis in the fol-
lowing manner: first, according
to the number of men actually liv-
