JOIN THE RED CROSS

Tuesday, the Red Cross began its drive to
interest Grinnell Students in its program

The Red Cross is an organization which
carries on a worthwhile program of mercy
and relief which is nation—wide ill its scope.

Few students realize the great work done
each year by this organization On the
average the Red Cross gives ief to 80
disasters each year In the Sp ng of 1936
when floods swept the eastern United States
this organization c‘ 'ed for 139,000 families
during March and Aprili At the same time,
cities ill the South were destroyed by tor»
nadoes, and here again the Red Cross fed,
clad, and housed 5000 families.

The cost of an annual membership to the
Red Cross is only a small with The mem-
bership dollar supports the aid given to
people in time of disaster, health work,
safety programs, adult education, aid to vet-
erans, and aid to children. The membership
dollar helps the Red Cross to carry on its
Splendid programr
‘ We urge Grinnell students to support this
program by joining the American Red
Cross, —Jr D. N.

THE REPUBLICAN FUTURE COURSE?

An impomant question in the field of
American politics at the present time is
what course the Republican party should
take in building for the future,

After four consecutive defeats in com
gressional and national elections the last
several years, the Republican palty must
adjust itself—at least for the present—to
the role of a militant minority partyi Wal-
ter Lippman believes that the New Deal
party will remain dominant until the force
of another great depression or the event of
an aimed conflict turns the country against
it and ousts it from power. Other authori-
ties believe that it will be only a matter of
a few years, and that when heavy taxation,
which is necessary in order to pay the cost
of the first New Deal administration, is felt
by the people and when labor troubles,
which are forecast, will disturb the nation,
the Republican party will regain its former
place of dominance in American politics,

At any rate, the Republican party must
adjust itself to its present role, What is
the wisest course for the minority party to
follow? It is undisputed that the Roosevelt
administration has shown decidedly pro-
gressive characteristics Some of its ven—

tures have shown marked signs of socialism
Some Republicans, greedy for victory, are
advocating that the Republican party out

 

 

conscr dtive party, and the Republican par-
ty can render the nation a great service by
possibly giving up all chances of a victory
at the polls for many years and by reorgan—
izing along strictly conservative lines, Such
men as Vandenburg of Michigan, McNary
of Oregon, Chppcr of Kansas, and the re-
cently elected Senator Henry Cabot Lodge,
Jr., of Massucllusetts~men of conservative
charhcteristicsishould be given the oppor-
tunity for reorganizing the program of the
Republican party,

it will be hard for these men to bring
about a reorganization, especially after GovA
ernor Alf Landon, the defeated Republican
presidential nominee, and John Hamilton,
chairman of the Republican national com-
mittee, wildly made promises to all classes
of the American electorate in a mad effort
to gain victory,

The Republican party can make itself of
invaluable service to the United States by
becoming a definitely conservative party.
We do not advocate that it become reactioir
ary. On the contrary, it should become
only conservative but with liberal leanings
It may mean defeat after defeat, but it will
be worthwhile.

The Republican party can attempt to gain
merely victory and make itself useless as a
factor ill American government, or the Re-
publican party can become a lively conserva-
tive party and be indispensable to the na-
tion,

With approximately 18 million voters as
21 nucleus, the Republican party has a great
future ahead of it, if the right men are
given the leadership and if they choose the
right course. eJ.D,N.

 

P
GLAMOUR on VIRTUE?
(Daily O’Collegian)

Which of these qualities do the so»callcd “big
shots" on collegiate campuses possess? Too fre-
quently, it is the aura of false greatness that is in-
stilled into the personality and character make-up
of the successful and notorious few who occupy the
high thrones in the realm of campus activities.

Glamour, or the envious allure that those oc-
cupying the pinnacle posts in student government
and publications have for the less fortunate ones, is
often misplaced. it is the average campus big-shot
who should be envious of the student who remains
in the campus background and then emerges from
his limbo to rocket across the business horizon, un-
hampered by any illusions of psuedo greatness, and
backed with a store of knowledge acquired by vir-
tue of merit alonel

An ease in making friends, both among stu<
dents and faculty members, is the natural result of
contest associations with both. It is true that many
of the students who become leaders in forming cam-
pus opinions and actions, merit the position they oc-
cupy, but it is also a fact that a great majority of
them rise to the leadership posts on personality
alone. Personality is a wonderful aid for any per-
son to have, but it can only be qualified as such and
not as the basic quality which a student should
strive to cultivate in his college days. Ability is the
merit that should be rewarded in college,

However, it often happens that both qualities
of personality and ability are not harmonized in a
majority of the students. Ability may he neglected
for the purpose of obtaining personality, and vice»
versa.

The student leaders often possess a mingling
of both virtues, personality and ahility, that en-
ables them to reach the top of the campus, They
are not to be censured for having perseverence in
pushing their way up from the mediocrity cf the
student body, but neither are they to be made into
idols of the campus with a, halo around a head that
is often incapable of taking advantage of the oppor-
tunities offered by the position.

The student leaders are not to be the victims of
unpremeditated idolatry, but should he given due
credit for the merits of the positions they occupy,
and the merits of their abilities and personalities
that allowed them to gain a foothold and then climb
the ladder to student activities.

As unthinking as the blind acceptance of
glamour-instilled merits of the student leaders is
the effort that undeserved honor has on the leaders
themselves. Modern businessithe universal field
of the college graduates todayiis a system that
recognizes no class barriers. but places a premium
on merits and results. The efficient and informed
student will have a better chance than the fortunate
"campussfavored" few. if the leadership qualities of
the “BMOC‘s” is not backed by adequate knowledge
