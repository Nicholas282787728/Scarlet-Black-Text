TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Critic Pleased With Production
of Play, ‘Kind Lady’

Searle, Moore Act Parts

Expertly in Drama
Last Night

Carl Nicnieycr

The dramatic season for the
year had an auspicious beginning
last night when the Grinncll Play~
ers presented Edward Chodorov's
“Kind Lady," the story of the
kind-hearted, wealthy woman who
finds her house first invaded and
at last possessed by a group of
unprincipled adventurers, headed
by a worthless and scheming
painter,

It is obvious from even this
bare summary that the two main
parts of the play are those of the
kind lady herself. Miss Herries,
and of the scoundrel, Henry Ab-
bott, who becomes a parasite up»
on her. Fortunately for the
pleasure of last night's audience.
both of these roles were handled
with real competence.

Searlo stars

Jane Searle, as Miss Herries.
played her part with dignity
and won from the audience the
sympathy so necessary to a suc-
cessful interpretation of the char
ccter, Her performance was eas-
ily the most nteresting of the
evening. Leroy Moore, playing
Henry Abbott, read hiq lines in-
telligently and made himself the
sinister and evil figure intended
by the playwright; but there was
one difficulty. So convincingly
repulsive did Abbott appear in
Mr. Moore's handling of the part

that one wondered how the "kind

lady” could have been taken in
by him in the first place. There
must surely have been some dla~
holic charm in the character as
orign'nally conceived: last night
the diabolism was not neglected,
but the charm somehow was
missing.

Mss Searle and Mr. Moore were
well supported, the most convinc-
ing of the remaining players be»
ing the members of the group of
rascals. Robert Hagan’s aston»
ishingly plausible cockney accent
did a good deal for the English
atmosphere of the play, and Elie
zaheth Clapp combined servility
and insolence in a believable mallv
ner,

mance, confined to a few gestures
and a couple (1 sentences, some»

Hurry Langla l, displayed a
gatifying obi . at playing light
comedy.

In any ﬁnished production the
actors get all the applause, and
the spectators go home assuming
probably that the actors also de-
serve all the credit. Much of it
for last night goes to Carl John-
son, the director, and of course to
the production staff. Both had
their problems, the former to
mahe youthful actors talk and
behave like Englishmen, the late

Judged by the strictest stand—

nature of things, llnqualifiedly
successful. But after being so de~
lightfully harrowed as was last
night’s audience, who would want
to be strict? Not, certainly, the
s. and as critic.

marked that the reason for this
fact is still a mystery to scien-
tists. \

The balloon was a cotton fabn'c
covered with rubber. ”This bag,"
he explained, “could not be filled
completely at the beginning, be-
cause in its ascent, the gas in the
balloon expands under the heat of
