Enrollment Gains
for First Term

New York, N. Y.—(ACP\rrPel'-
haps it is too early to say that
prosperity is back again, but
judging from the large gains in
enrollment in most of the univer-
sities and colleges throughout the
country, it is well on the comer
hack road.

A recerlt survey of so schools
in the east, west 'and south
showed an increase of 18,072—6
per cent. Not one of the 2s insLir
tutions in central and western
United states chosen at random
lost in attendance. 0n the con-
trary, these colleges and universi—
ties, collectively, showed an in»
crease of 3.2 per cent. Three-quar.
ters of these schools have chalked
up the largest registrations in
their history.

Increase in South

The 14 southern schools in the
tabulation, too, showed a sharp
upward rise—also 8.2 per cent.
Only two of the colleges in the
group, University of West Vin
ginia and Randolph-Macon report-
ed slight taperings in attendance

Eastern colleges and universir
ties, presumably because of limit-
ed enrollments in many, did not
exhibit such a marked upward
trend. The 3.4 per cent rise, how—
ever, is not without significance.
or the 41 eastern schools, only
six slumped from last year's level.

Registrars and administrators
from coast.ta coast attribute the
new “highs" to improved econom-
ic conditions. The registrar at
Antioch college, for instance,
says:

”We have fewer students on
the ragged edge financially this
year than we have bad for some
time."

strange as it sounds, one col-
lege accounts for its decreased
enrollment in the new prosperity:

"For the first time in recent
years a considerable number of
girls have withdrawn their appli-
cations because they have decided
to attend' private colleges.” states
Mrs. Mary B. J. Lolin, registrar of
Hunter college.

None of the registrars beiieves
that the N. Y. A. student-aid has
in itself influenced the enroll-
ments. Only six of the so consider
it even a major factor, respon
ble for as much as half of the in-
crease. consensus is best dis
played in this statement by Alan
Bright of Carnegie Institute of
Technology:

“The increase this year, in my
opinion, was brought by improved
financial conditions at home and
was not materially affected by
NYA, as the NYA assistance was
available last year.
