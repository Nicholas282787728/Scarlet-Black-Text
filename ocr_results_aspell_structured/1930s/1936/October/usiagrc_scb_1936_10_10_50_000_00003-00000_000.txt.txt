Bill Sampson, veteran halfback
on the Pioneer squad, will get his
first chance to prove he has earned
a starting assignment today when
he will start against the Jays.

. Sampson, a first string baa-fr

last year initil a shoulder injury

kept him out of the last two
games, hasn't been seeing much
action this year. An outstanding
blocker, Sampson is also one oi
the hardest hitting defensive

men on the squall.

The game today will mark
the eleventh time Creighton and
Griimell have met in football.
Although the scores have always
been close, 14 points marking
the biggest difference between
the two schools, Creighton is far
nhead in all time standings, win-

games. in 1925 Cri-innell beat

Athletic authorities are more
than a little worried over George
Cisar, who has been ill for the
past week Cisar was counted up—
