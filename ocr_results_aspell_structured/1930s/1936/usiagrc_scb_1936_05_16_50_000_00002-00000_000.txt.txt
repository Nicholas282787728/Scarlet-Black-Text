A GROWING NEED.
Although Doric is generally conceded to be a column of humor
and campus gossip, the last number contained an ohvioiis truth
which should ot be overlooked,

In a sat ical manner, the Doric editor wrote among other

things under the general caption, “Things I Never Knew Before”.

that “Grinnell students actually have a right to selfrgovel-llment if
they care to exercise it."

This year, the Scarlet and Black has voiced the fact that Grin-
nell students do have an excellent opportunity for self-government
if they will only take advantage of it.

This opportunity is extended to Grinncll students on a golden
platter, but apparently that is as far as it has gone,

Why is it that crinnoll students fail to assume the responsibil-
ity of real student government? Perhaps, it is because the Stu»
dents are indifferent to self-government, perhaps, it is because the
students lack the ability to exercise student government. Perhaps,
it is because the students are more interested in their small groups
and cliques than in campus affairs and problems, Or, perhaps, it is
because Grinnell students simply are too cautious and too consei»
vative.

A majority of Grinnell students, at any rate, are evidently not
interested in student government, and they not only fail to take ad-
vantage of the opportunity offered to them, but they hinder other
interested and enthusiastic students from creating something more
than a farce of our student government by making our student
elections rncre popularity contests. »

The Scarlet and Black has said before that “popularity does
not mean ability, but ability is needed badly." The idea that be—
cause a person is a “hale fellow, well met," whose popularity is daz-
zling throughout the campus, does not lend itself to efficient stu-
dent government.

There is an opportunity for revi ion of our student government
“in the dormitories, in the quadrangle, and on the campus in gene
eral. It is hard to believe that our student government is perfect.
oiir Student council could possibly be made a more representative
body. our men's hall government can obviously be made more efr
fec’tivc. Our Women’s league board, while it has been shown to
function remarkably well, might undergo some changes.

The Scarlet and Black urges campus readers to take advan
tage of the opportunity offered to them.‘ There is an obvious need
for improvementifor perhaps radical changes, for perhaps only
minor ones, but nevertheless there is a real need,

FACULTY NON-COOPERATION.
For the past several years the Scarlet and Black has battled,
silently for the most part, against two attitudes of the Grinnell col-
‘lege faculty in relation to the campus paper. The first attituude is
that of non-cooperation with the paper in the matter of news cover
age. Countless stories might he told about how different members
of this faculty have at various times and for little or no reason re-
fused to give perfectly legitimate news to reporters for the paper,

In other instances, nien doing work for the paper have been
treated like children when they have been in search of news, They
have been shouted at, ordered out of offices and generally miss
handled when they have been doing their work in the most gentle
manly manner.

The second attitude, which the paper has had to fight against,
is that idea in the minds of some faculty members that the Scar-
let and Black is nothing but a publicity sheet for that particular
department. They believe it should be run in accordance with the
ideas of the persons in charge of that department instead of ac-
cording to journalistic methods and the mechanical and technical
litmitations faced by the managing editor.

There are some persons on this campus who have at various
times tried to dictate the make-up of the paper in order that the
news from their particular departments should be given preference
in spite of its real news value in relation to the value of other
stories.

These people must be made to see that only so much news can
be featured, and that it must be selected in a fair and impartial
manner, giving preference to those stories which have the most
general campus interest. Only in this way can the Scarlet and
Black remain a representative paper.

The only remedy for this situation is to have a different atti-
tude on the part of those from whom news must be obtained.
When a reporter from the paper calls on the members of the facul-
ty he should he treated as a person of normal intelligence, instead
of as a simple child who does not know what he is doing.

And, finally, the management of the paper MUST be left up to
the person chosen for that work, if the paper is to be retained as a

fair and impartial news organ on this campus.

Robert Irwin’s “Mercy on Us”,
which was awarded the Henry
York Steiner Memorial prize in
playwritinggafter its first performs
ance last night in the Alumni Rees

with a good many literary reminis

(played by Philip Bridgham),
sometimes talks like Shapespeai-e's

IRWIN WINS PRIZE

Robert lrwin ’36, won the
Henry York Steiner memorial
prize in drama last night with
his play, “Mercy On Us!"

Lhreile Kendall ’38, won the
prize for the best actress, and
Baxter Smith ’37, the prize for
the best actor. Both appeared in
“Out of the Closet” by Mai-gain
et vance. These acting prizes
were offered by the department
of drama, and the winners were
decided by the audience.

The judges for the contest
were Roland Fernand, associate
editor of the Dramatic Publish-
ing company, and Dr. M. Cathr
cn'ne Lyons of Maclcan college.

The prizes in playivr' iig
were announced after the per-
formances by Miss Sarah lnnes
MacDonald, chairman of the
committee on prizes and
awards.

Pooley) strongly suggests the con-
ventional idea of the Puritan,

But of the three plays presented,
“Mercy on Us!” (a meaningless
title, incidentally) alone was built
around an ideainamely, that those
who really deserve heaven are the
ones who have had their fun on
earth. Furthermore, in this play
Mr. Irwin boldly wrote fantasy.
The mere fact that it was not bad
fantasy might well have been
enough to win him a prize

on Us’ Contains

‘Many Literary Reminiscences’

0f the two competitors, Margar-
et Vance’s “Out of the Closet”
WRS the funnier, and Maurice Bird-
sall's ”Ad Astra per Aspen.” the
more thoughtful. The latter, a
semi-serious study of the problem
freshman, was interesting but a
little too local in interest. The
play suffered also from the fact
that all of the four actors read
their lines as if they were making
them up as they went along. There
were moments of painful uncer»
tainty when neither the cast nor

,the audience knew what was com»

ing next, and when the author
must have been wringing his hands
offstage.

Miss Vance’s play was the best
presented of the three, although
the strikingly theatrical setting of
“Mercy on Us” made it the best
mounted of the group. The cast of
“Out of the Closet” was experi—
enced in getting laughs out of dra-
matic material and could probably
have done a good job with a less
promising play.

Make Play More Rapidly

Robert Burchctt, who always
acts as if he were not acting, and
Larenc Kendall did much to make
the play move rapidly. Only when
the curtain had fallen and one
stopped laughing did one rememe
her that the play was very slight,
and suspect that if it had been less
expertly done it might have fallen
flat completely.

It suffers from the presence of
a rather unconvincing romantic
theme and from a quite unnecese
sary “happy ending," by which an
itinerant director of plays becomes
a respectable bank clerk. But such
unreaiity is the characteristic of
farce, and farce the play truly was,
as the audience instantly decided
watching Larene Kendall, offi-
ciously assisted by Betsy Ross,
try on a‘ dress several sizes too
small, and seeing Baxter Smith
aim unerringly at an old-fashioned
cuspidor.
