Purchase of Top Hat First Act
ofNewest African “Brain Truster”

John Spencer Then Finds
Hal Scant Protection
Against Sun

The purchase of a tall, silk top-
per, the first he ever owned, was
the initial act of John Hathaway
Spencer '29, newest member of the
African “Brain Trust" of Emperor
Haile Selassie, when he received
his appointment. It was a bean ‘-
ful high, silk hat, thc kind all dip-
lomats must wear to look official;
so hc had his picture taken in it,
complete with black topcoat and
Silk scarf, his mother, Mrs, E. B
T. Spencer, informed at Scarlet
and Black reporter, meanwhile
showing a recent: Snapshot. of the
new Ethiopian aide:

Spencer’s new position is the
high point so far in a career of
great interest and variety for one
so young. He is only 28. Born in
Rome, Italy, he came with his par
exits to this country at the age of
three and hbre grew up in 9. nor-
mal fashion, Entering Grinnell coir
lege, he decided to major in Greekl
“John’s chief interest was in his
studies," his father related, “He
realized that he should Concentrate
on them to get the fullest benefit
from his college wcr

Summer Activities

Mrs. Spencer told of his Summer
activities; four summers working
on government trails in Estes
Park, Colo, two as his father's cs-
sistant in conducting European
tours for the American Express
company, Oddly enough, those
summers tire of great advantage to
him now. The days in the high cl»
titude and rcrlficd atmosphere of
Estes Park put him in good condi-
tion for standing the altitude of
the plateau on which Addis Ababa
is situated. And during the sec-
and summer of his tours, he spent

 

some time in Algiers, his initial in-

trodutclon to Africa

Besides his intemational law,
Spencer has other interests. He
was 21 member of the Men's Glee
club at Grinnell, one of the found»
ers of th Men's Forensic society,
and an accomplished ’cellist, study—
ing under Mr. George L. Pierce,
professor of pianoforte. After his
graduation, he was offered a posi—

‘tion as professor of ’cello at an-

other college but declined
Phi 3cm Kappa

He was clcctcd to Phi Beta chr
pa, ,nctlcnal honorary scholastic
fraternity, in the fall of his senior
year, as one of the four highest
ranking scholars of his class. “Ber
sides his thorough knowledge of
Greek, Lutln, French, German,
Italian and English, he is acquainc
ed with several other languages,"
his father said, "and now expects
to add Coptic, the Ethiopian
tongue, to his list. Coptic," Fur
fesscr Spencer explained, “is relatr
ed to none of the modern European
languages, but has a construction
all its own,” and he displayed some
samples which looked much
very poorly written shorthand.

When he went to take up thcl

Humboldt fellowship in Berlin last
year, he spent some time as the
guest of the president of the dis-
trict of Mcricnwcrdcr and studied
especially the problem of Danzig
and the Polish corridor Last sum-
mer while he wars in this country
he spent the month of July attendA
ing a convention of professors of
international law at Detroit, Mich.
Will Hear Seldom

“We don’t expect to hear from
John often, because of censorship
and the cost of cablegrams,” Mrs.
Spencer explained. She told of his
plan to Send a four-word cable

once a week, such as the one they

received the other day: "Spencer.
Grinnell, Iowa, Well. Cables from

Ethiopia cost about 75 cents a

like '

lword and the address coupts, too.
“‘We’ll be satisfied to know that.
he is all right,” she said, but she
expressed llope that some day they
might see him in the newsrccls
'wlth Hallo Selassie.

Thc peculiar helmets which the
Ethiopians wear have long puzzled
Mrs. Spcncer, but; she discovered
their purpose the other day and
explained it to the reporter. They
serve as a protection from the
strong ultrawiolet my: so near the
equator. “I suppose he'll have to
wear one, too," she said, “and wear
his silk hct only in the evenings.”
