A REAL STUDENT NEWSPAPER

With this issue of the paper plans have
been completed for the establishment of all
editorial board under the direction of a stu-
dent chairman to take complete charge of the
editorial policies of the paper.

Tllis plan was drawn up by the manage-
ment of the paper ill order to give the student
body of Grillnell a better chance to par '
pate in tile editorial policies of the paper Ill
the past this has been solely the responsibility
of the managing editor, and the result has,
been that the students have not par cipated
as much as they might have ill the affairs of
the papel: The new plan is designed to off-
set this difficulty.

Tryouts for positions on the editorial
board will be held shortly, and now the stue
dent body will be given an opportunity to
take part ill the editor ll policies of the pa-
per.

if the idea is to be a success, the students
must cooperate ill the matter wholeheartedly.
Now is the time to make the Scarlet and
Black really a student newspaper.

WHAT’S THE WORLD COMING TO‘.7

One of the most absurd ideas which has
appeared on this campus is the newly organ-
ized National Student Relief association.
What earthly use such an institution can
have is beyond our comprehension.

The platform asking for 69 cents for
each class cut, for absolute government sup—
port of college students, and for a bucketful
of caviar a week can in no conceivable way
be achieved. And we ask~when this is real-
ized at the outset, what justification is there
for continuing?

True, it may be that all these proposi-
tions have been made ill full, and i is possible
that that is generally understood on the cam-
pus, although we find a general attitude of
bewilderment and in many cases, fear, lest
they really become serious.

The rccent issuance of statements of
praise by several of tllc faculty and the pro-
posal to name Harry Hopkins, Chester Davis,
and Gary Cooper as heads of a national party
do seeln serious. It seems scarcely possible
that these three would endorse such a plan.

The most importhnt thing which we see
looming ahead is public opinion. What will
people over this territory think of this ir a-
tiollal scheme of Grinncll students? An inst
tiltion such as Grillnellior any college, for
that mattcr~must constantly consider public
opinion A collcgo's whole life is dependent

THE GRINNELL SCARLET‘AND BLACK

on general good willi And certain it is, that
many, and perhaps most, outsiders will take
this plan as an indication of general campus
movement.

The whole tendency of the world today,
the l Vsterical demand for monetary and
otllci impossible measures of government aid
is frightening And we, on our part, 1001:
with dismay upon the situation.

Truly we may ask, “What is this world
coming to?”

Other Opinions

REEDOM on THE PRESS
(Daily Trojan)

Tlicrc have been few more poignant issues lic-
fore the public than the present and often ignorant
ly blatant discussion of the mythical ”freedom of
the press." Apparently this simple phlase is so
easily understood that college coiioi-a as well as pro
fessionul journalists have finally met on common
grounds.

The American Newspaper Publishers associa-
tion met yesterday in New York and called for the
support of 1,900 newspapers “to battle for the free
dam of thc press." These publishers are accusing
the Black lobby ccmmittec of violating the first,
fourth, and fifth constitutional amendments in its
senatorial investigation.

It is but natural that every editor throughout
the United States should be averse to governmental
censorship of the press, but inasmuch as there is lit-
tle actual danger of any such occurrence, it seems
that once again there is mllch cclo about nothing.

There is not an editor, professional or collegiate.
who does not realize that his pubiishci- has certain
interests to be contradicted by his own publication.

The protection of these intcrests are not neces-
sarily illegal, nor are they necessarily protected for
personal aggranolizemcnt. Freedom of the press in
this country is entirely safe from governmental rcge
ulutioni
