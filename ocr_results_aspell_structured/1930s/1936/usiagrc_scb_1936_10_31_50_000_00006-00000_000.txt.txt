WELCOME BACK

This week-end, graduates and former
students numbering almost 200 have return‘
ed to our campus to renew old acquaintan—
ces, to live again in halls and cottages
where once they planned glorious futures, to
inspect changes in the campus‘ physical
plant and in the general attitude of the
present generation of Grinllellians.

We of the present student body wel»
come you, our guests, to visit the new and
old rooms of the quadrangle and dormitory
as well as the college’s resident houses in
town. We hope you will feel free to ask
us where the various offices of the admin—
istration and faculty are located. We want
to prove to you that Grinnell still maintains
its traditions of friendliness and hospitality
—’t'hose traditions which you helped build.

It is our wish that you may so partici~
pate in the activities for the week-end, that
you will be thrilled by your stay in Grinnell
and by the contact with new and old friends.
And above all we hope you have a happy
Homecoming. ~11).

FROM DEMOCRACY TO DICTATORSHIP

The war seems to be drawing to a
close. The revolutionists are almost within
shelling distance of Madrid. The defenders
are demoralized and short of food. Foreign
intervention and general war have been so
far barely avoided by the non»intewention
council at London. It is time to look around
and see what this tragedy means to the
world.

Who are these revolutionaries who are
again turning Spain over, bringing the
twenty-eighth change of government since
the republic was founded in 1931, and why
are they ruining Spain now? These rebels,
commonly called Fascists, are made up of all
the small rightist and conservative factions
including the landlords, the big industiial-
ists, the professional churchmen, and most
of the officers in the professional army.
They were defeated with a ratio of about 10
to '7 in the parliamentary elections by the
leftist united front which included the
stalying peasants and industrial workers,
disposesscd by landlords and industrialists.

The conservative classes had absolute
control of the government until the republic
and practical control until February, 1936.
They could not stand the loss of control five
months without trying a coup d’ctat with

the aid of the army blindly obedient to th'é
sympathetic officers. An extlcme statement
of their position as made by a Spanish army
officer is, ”The human race is made up of
the ruling class and the serfs and always
will be. We must teach the serfs such a
lesson that they will know their place for
the next 100 years,"
mean an extremely dangerous block of Fas»
cist nations in. western Europe.

Many Americans have the problem
mixed in their minds, Some sympathize
with the revolutionary reactionon'es, and
some do not understand the term. They
are used to thinking of revolutionaries as
socialists, so can’t understand how rebels op-
posing n Socialist government are revolu-
tionaries. Americans respect the Church
and are on the side of the churchmen. They
forget that the Spanish church has been an
instrument of repression in the hands of the
aristocrats, and the priests are bitterly hat-
ed by the people. Americans are conserva-
tive themselves so tend to forget that the
radical government was democratically
elected and trying to help the great majority
of the people.

The lesson we may draw from the ter-
rible Spanish drama is that if we want to
preserve democracy and peace we must bo-
lieve in them firmly and guard against all
tendencies towards the civilization destroy-
ers of revolution and repression even though
defeated. G 7R.G.

CONGRATULATIONS CHORUS

The ,very fact that rlppl'o 'mutely 100
students attended tho first meeting of the
Student chorus attests to the great need
there is for such an organization on the
campus. Any activity in which nearly an
eighth of the student body participates is
bound to prove a valuable addition to cam-
pus life.

Grillliell college is fortunate in having
u music department that recognizes the
need for musical expression on the part Of
many interested students who are not
members of either of the glee clubsin. de-
partment that is willing to cooperate in
making the new Student chorus a vital part
of Grinllell lifcl

The enthusiasm manifested at the first
practice, ZIS well as the numbers thzlt turned
out, shows that there is really an active
demand for such an organization here, and
with the help of the capable director who
has taken charge of the group, we may well
expect to see the new Student chorus be-
come an important part of our life here.

Grinnell is to be congratulated that the
organization is duly launched,

ONLY BECAUSE OF COOPERATION

This edition of the Scarlet and Black is
the largest paper published this year, or in
the last two years, for that matter, and it
represents the campus joul'nalists‘ contribu-
tion to the Homecoming spirit.

But beyond the ié pages which you will
read today, is a vast amount of work, that
the lay reader does not realize or compre-
hend. With a small printing shop, and lack
of the high speed equipment used by the
daily newspapers, the task of putting out
the extra-large edition is a huge one. That
it has been successfully accomplished is on-
ly because the members of both the editorial
and business staffs cooperated so heartily in
getting the necesary work done. Without
this cooperation on the part of the business
staff, the executive editors, the editorial
chairman and board, the feature staff and
the news division, the task would have been
impossible, But their cooperation has spelled
success for this huge undertaking, and it is
to these members whose names appear in
the different positions on the masthead,
that credit for this large Homecoming edi-
tion is due:

Some of the students at the UniverSity of Kenr
tucky go to great lengths for an education. Imagine
covering 11,300 miles just to go to school. From
China? India? No, they only live about so odd
miles from the campus, but they commute dsily.
One of the fellows figures that he burns spproxi-
mately 785 gallons of gas during the school year,
which amounts to . . . .lct's see . . . . maybe you’d
better figure it out for yourself.

Nine Members
of Faculty Rate
‘Who’s Who’

Fame has been achieved by
nine members of the Gn'nnell col-
lege faculty — their biographies
are included in the 1934-1935 edi-
tion of ”Who’s Who in America."
This fat, red volume on the sec-
ond floor of the library contains
the life history of each one of
them, how old they are, where
they went to school, and all the
little details that puzzle their stu-
dents,

The nine professors, and the
classifications which the volume
g es them are: Elias Blum, mu-
5‘ an; Henry s, Conerd, botanist;
Cecil F. Laveil, college professor;
Raymond B McClenon, mamemar
tics; John S. Nollen, educator;
Henry W, Norris, zoologist; Ed-
ward 13. T. Spencer, educator; Erl»
ward A, Steiner, sociologist; and
John D. stuups, philosophy.

A tenth Grinnellian listed in
“Who's Who" is Edmund M. Vit-
lum, a retired Congregational
minister living in Grinnell,

Men and women qualified for
admission into “Who's Who in
America," according to the state
ment of the cditors, arc: “First,
those who are selected on account
of special prominence in creditable
lines of effort, making them the
subjects of extensive interest, in
quiry, or discussion in the counr
try; and second, those who are
arbitrarily included on account of

naval, religions, educational, etc."

Medical Schools to Have
New Method of Showing
Surgical Operations

Rochester, N. Y., (ACP)7SDOH
many medical schools will discard
the present system of demonstra-
ting surgical operatiohs for a
more colorful one. '

In the laboratory classes, it is
difficult for students far removed
from the operating stle to see
the setusl work from the view—
point of the surgeon. Hereafter,
color motion pictures will be em-
ployed in some schools to show
technique of the surgeon.

How can the process be filmed?
Simple. Dr. R. Plato Schwartz,
of the University of Rochester,
explains that the photographer,
by using color film sensitized to
artificial light and by using a
telephoto lens. can now take pier
tures over the surgeon's shoulder
ipictures that will reproduce the
operation in true color and, also
essential, in the right size and
perspective,

Dr. Schwartz anticipates uni-
versal use of this novel teaching
method within s. short time. one
of the advantages he points out
is that unusual surgical cases can
be projected many times for in-
structing, lecture purposes, and
case histories,
