MY DAD DID IT

(Dckotn Student)

One day an old farmer was plodding along a
dusty road. Behind him a much-used mulc stumbled
along. his halter rope dragging in the dust. From
one side of the mulc's back. suspended by a rope.
hung three cans of crcam and a sack of grain. On
the other side, tied to the ropc which was support-
ing the grain and cream. hung a great rock. As the
mule walked his big cars wobbled back and forth; he
seemed contented enough.

As the two pleaded along they met a stranger.
The stranger. looking at the double load on the back
of the mule. stopped the farmer and said. "Your
mulc is carrying twice as much as he should. Why
don't you untie the rock and put the grain there in
stead? Then the load will be balanced and the
mule will not have such a large load.”

The farmer looked around at his donkey and
replied. “By Gar! that is right!” and forthwith
changed the load and continued on his way. As he
walked along. doubts assailed him. His grandfather
before him had always carried the load using a rock.
His father had always used the rock. He then turned
the donkey around; went back to the rock lying u,
the ditch and replaced it on his donkey. .

The following year he went to the polls and
voted a straight ticket; his father had voted that
way, hadn't he?

The buglcs and the drums will have to sound
much more loudly this time than before if the mus

their battles for them. Legislation and understand-

The university can never lose, declared a well-
