EOSTLY TIW‘ gAva.

Last year the college authorities made a
valient attempt to grow a little grass in the
path from the south door of the Alumni
Recitation hall to the steps leading to the
College Book store. This spring, in spite
of all this effort, the path looks as bare
and hard~packed as the tennis courts.

This bare place is an eye-sore on the

campus. Grlnnell has long been noted for
the natural beauty of its grounds, but it
cannot hope to maintain its reputation 11'
students are so careless as to deliberately
make paths as wide and unsightly as this.
The distance between the Alumni Recita—
tion hall is short enough so that only about
20 seconds would be lost by a person who
walked to the Book store on the sidewalk
instead of cutting across, yet great streams
of students constantly use the short cut be-
tween classes, probably on the principle
that they are saving a great deal of time.
\ Many people will say that this is a minor
point, not worth talking about. Possibly
so, but the sum of these little things makes
an important point which can well affect
the reputation of the school.

If, then, you as students‘wish to help
maintain Grinnell’s reputation for having a
beautiful campus, if you want to help make
a good impression on visitors and at the
some time remove an eye-sore from the
campus, take a little more time when walk-
ing down to the bookstore. Walk around
on the sidewalk and save the grass.

A VALUABLE PERIOD, .

With the beginning of the reading period
Saturday there comes to every Grinnell
student the much appreciated opportunity
to pursue his or her studies privately for
the six days preceding examinations.
Assigned reading is given for the purpose
of clarifying and supplementing courses just
completed.

Ample time is allowed for a general rc-

Tﬂlli! GRINNFLL SCARLET AND BLACK

view and self-mastery of a subject which is
especially important to the seniors, who are
faced with the problem of taking compro-
hensivc examinations cove illg four years of
work taken in their major field.

Furthermore, the reading period provides
a few days for students to concentrate on
those subjects in which they feel need 01‘
special organization, and it al'l'ords many
students, in particular the freshmen, who
are uneasy about the approaching examina-
tions, time ill which to acquire a more sta
ble mental attitude.

Therefore, the vast majority of students
welcome a six day reading period and are
grateful to the faculty for the privileges
of having one.

RETURN OF HELL WEEK.

Witll the restoration of a modified form
of “Hell Week" to the campusea “Hell
Week” minus paddling and \‘ulgal'lties, and
which will not interfere with normal school
workithe Council of House Presidents and
the Dean of Men seem finally to have a —
rived at a sane and balanced policy ill 1 -
gard to the handling of freshmen.

It is obvious that the old form of “Hell
Week” ill which men were sent on vulgar
or ands to the quadrangle and were sub
jected to brutal and humiliating treatment
is indefensible. The college student—even
the freshman—is not an animal, whose
mind is of such an order that he can be
appealed to only through beating. On the
contrary lie is a human being who must be
treated as such.

The new system eliminates this objection
to the old ”Hell Week.” A good “Hell
Week,” properly managed and handled in a
decent way, can be made a good deal
of fun both for the upperclassmen and the
freshmen. But there must be no slipeup.
The upper-classmen’s desire to swing the
big paddle must be controlled, and anyone
with an overwhelming desire to visit the
quadrangle on one of the errands which
have typified past “Hell Weeks” would be a
good deal wiser if he would suppress i.
Only in this way will the new system be a
success.

The Council of House Presidents and the
Dean of Men deserve heartiest congratular
tions for conceiving the new plan and put-
ting it illto effect on this campus.

EDUCATION Fort CITIZENSHIP

(Daily Northwestern)

In spite of the fact that ”education for citizen4
ship" has been a goal of education in the Unitau
states for several hundred years, the average
American citizen leaves school with only a few
facts about government: the age at which c man
may become president, the term of office of con-
gressmen, the duties of me county shei-in‘. Most
of his knowledge is acquired from the partisan
press, from pressure groups, or l'rcm the radio.
He has no concept of what government really is,
and with no foundation, his political vision Is uls-
torted by a lack of perspective.

Except by a broad and well planned education
one cannot get a sense of what government really
is. The logical place to acquire this education is
in our schools. At present, there are few courses
outside of the political science departments offered
on this subject, and these could stand improve-
ment. One respect in which the political educa-
tion of most schools needs re-invigorating' is in the
concept of government as a social rather than a
narrowly political institution. And a liberal edu-
cation shculd include a broad knowledge of all the
separate functions of our social structure.

it we are to eliminate the disorders in our poli-
tical system we must lubricate me gears in our
social system by means of political education. Let
the school set out first to provide c series of in-
sights into the nature sml function of the state,
and the normal processes of living will add to our
respective outlooks the details and routine inter-
mation that wc need.
