New Plan for Use
of “Rec” Room
Adopted by ‘Co-edo

A new plan for week-end use of
the recreation room by which vari-
ous couples of men and women will
be hosts and hostesses in the room
was adopted by the League board
at their meeting Monday after
noon.

By this arrangement, which is
similar to one employed by Swarthr
more college, one couple acting as
host and hostess may invite four
or five other couples to the recrea-
tion room for dancing, cards, or
ping pong and will also he hosts
to other eouples who may drop in.
The plan is to apply to Friday, Sat-
urday and sunday nights as well
as Sunday afternoons.

The Board hopes with this new
plan to “create a feeling of hospi—
tality and friendliness,” said Mars
ian Bair, president. Hours for the
use of the recreation room have
been posted in the cottages.

The room may be reserved for
parties through the Dean of Wom-
en's ottiee and on such occasion a

Wreserved” sign will be put on the

door.
