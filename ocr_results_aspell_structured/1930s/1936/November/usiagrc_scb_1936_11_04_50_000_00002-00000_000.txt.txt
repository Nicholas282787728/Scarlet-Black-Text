AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION

The painting of buildings on the Drake campus by
people allegedly connected with Grinnell gives rise to an
unfortunate situation. It was more than a college prank
in the Spirit of fun, for it cost time and money to remove
the traces of the vandals’ brush.

However, the real significance of the act is in results
which may accru . Between Drake and Grinnell there
has been only friendly rivalry, and such an act of van-
alism may do much to endanger this Spirit. In what
appears to the p petrators as being a harmless act, are
the seeds of a rivalry of vandalism which may grow to
dangerous proportions and result in nothing but hard
feelings between the two schools. In addition, the fair
name of Grinnell certainly was not improved by the van-
dalism which undoubtedly received state wide reception.

Grinnell is noted as a liberal college, one in which
the students Show more than average good-sense, but this
reputation was not carried out in Friday night’s foray.
If such destruction of other property is fun, then we can
not agree with their definition of fun, and in addition we
dislike both as individuals and as Grinnellians being
classed as hair-brained students with no sense of respon-
sibility, the opinion created in the luinds of many who
read only the news accounts, and are led to believe that
the vandalism is generally condoned.

The entire situation is unfortunate to the utmost
degree, and it behooves all true Grinnellians to do their
utmost to eradicate from the public mind false opinions
that may have been engendered by Friday’s vandalism.
Grinnell can not hope to continue its high reputation if
such vandalism is to he condoned.

A WELCOME INCREASE 0F SPIRIT

The increase in Spirit and support of the team which
developed this week-end is particularly heartening after
three years of lethargy on the part of the student body.
For the first time. in three years the students of this
college really proved that they wele behind the team
and that they wanted the boys to go out there and win.

That the team deserved the support given them and
that the spirit meant something to them was amply
proved when the boys went out there Saturday and play»
ed the game of their lives. True, they were beaten, but
they fought every minute of that game to bring the
students a. victory.

'EVel'y student of this college who took part in the
variousexllibitions of enthusiasm which went on practi—
cally Without interruption starting last Tuesday evening
deserves the highest commendation. —W.l-I.B.

hacked Roosevelt in the recent
election.

Comments
of the Readers

To the students and Faculty:

For the first time in several
years, our longrdormant Grinncll
spirit was successfully revived dur—
ing Homecoming. We feel that
this was due in a. large part to
your hearty cooperation with the
plans of the pcp committee.

At this time we wish to thank
you for the enthusiasm which you,
as students, displayed. Now that
you have shown your " cppy pose
slhilities,” keep the spirit up; and
see the athletic seasons through to
the end of the year with the same
Grinnell spirit.
