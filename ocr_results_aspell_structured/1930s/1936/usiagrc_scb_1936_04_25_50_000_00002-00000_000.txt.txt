straight sets, 6- 6-2, to win the

to out-fight their opponents, 11-9
in their second set, and only after
a fast, gruelling set were Turner
and Everett able to win the final
match, 6 4

Tracy Garrett, Grinnell number
4 man, pushed Turner hard in the
second set of their match, finally
dropping it 3 games to 6, after
losing' his f st set, 6-1.

gan. These records, set in 1918.
may fall before the efforts of eith-
er Cowan, West Waterloo, winner
in the 100 and l'un'nebllp in the
220 last year, or Phillips of North
Des Moines, Phillips lies a time
of 139.9 in the 100-yard dash r -
corded already this year, and with
favorable conditions may better
the :09.8 record.

North High, last year’s winner,
will be hard pressed to retain the
crown. Comparative scores seem
to show that East Des Moines has
a good chance of taking the title,
but the ivnining team will not have
an easy afternoon

Final entries are due today, and
it is expected that at least 18 or
20 outstanding teams will partici-
pate. There are indications that
this year's event will be larger than
last year’s when 225 athletes com-
peted.

“All freshmen who have not

president of the Honor G, announc-
ed Thursday, "The council has
agreed to cooperate with us, and
we intend to see that the caps are

The Council also discussed and
drew up plans for room assign-

allotting the rooms shortly.

My, My, My How Rules for Ladies
Have Changed Since 1885

Ancient Etiquette Book
Tells What Nice Girls
Used to Do

13- Frances c. Hansen
:‘Talks with Homely Girls on
Health and Beauty; Lheir Preser-
vation and Cultivation." That is
the title of a battered little red
book recently acquired by the Flor-
ence Lewis Memorial library in the
quadrangle. It was written in
1885 by Frances Smith. And
right next to it on the shelf stands
the latest word on the subject,
Alice-Leone Moats' book “No
Nice Girl swears,“
The Homely Girl
“Paint is used, we

is advised,
believe, by

some absurd women, on the lipsi,

we necd scarcely say to their ul-
tiniate injury, and always at the
user's peril.” But Alice-Leone
says, “Even the most jaundiced
dowager will admit that powder
puffs and the unrestrained use of
a lipstick outside the bondoir are
certainly preferable
round shiny- -nosetl and pale lip-

.ped ”

Should Feel Full Repose

Both books have words to say on
a ladys sitting posture In 1885
it was “Every one seating her-
self should take her place deliber-
ately and so completely that she
may feel the full i-eposeof thechair,
which it is designed to give . . .
Sprawling of all kinds is avoided
by well-bred people, who shun ex-
cessive ease as much as excessive
formality"

In 1936 it is— “Nothing could
better illustrate today's ‘Who
cares?’ attitude toward the ameni-
ties of the drawing-room than the
careless positions we assume in
chairs, on sofas, and even on the
floor 1 . . By all means, sit in any
position 'you like, so long as you
have pretty legs."

Dancing Should Be Regulated

Dancing then seems to have been
quite as popular as it is now. Miss
Smith comments, ”No one, we
suppose, in these liberal days,
strenuously opposes dancing,
proper‘ly regulated, which it sel-
dom is . . . We cannot. however,
see the neccssisty of dancing the
German from midnight to four

o‘clock in the morning, six days ,

out of the seven of each week.”

Alice—Leone confines most of
her comments to “Cutting in and
Sitting Out," but mentions in
passing, “Only a debutante can
understand why putting her head
on her partner's shoulder and
playing London Bridge with the
rest of her anatomy should hear
any resemblance to dancing."

Tight Lacing Uncomfortable

The Homely Girl of 1885 was
warned against one evil which we
are spared today: “Tight lacing
makes one intensely uncomfort-
able, to begin with, and long per-
sistence in the foolish practice,
rcddens the nose irremediably, and
as certainly as tight shoes pro-
duces sick headaches "

They say that this is a spring
of startling color combinations, but
we’ve seen nothing like the ones
recommended in 1885. Miss Smith
says, “Purple may be embellished
with gold or orange, or a little
amber, or even scarlet. Mauve
may be combined with cerise.
white and gold, Cerise agrees with
lilac, silver-grey, pale lavender, or
it may be heightened by a dexter-
ous use of gold and scarlet."

Homchlade Cosmetics Popular.

 

to trailing ‘

if .

Some of the home made cosme-
tics and poultices they used in '35
make one wonder how they ever
survived. One recipe for lip-salve
(Not a lip-rouge, of course) is as
follows: “Two ounces or white

Iwax, two ounces of olive oil, a
quarter of an ounce of spermaceti.
ten drops of oil of lavender, one
ounce of alkanet root. Soak the
alkanet for three days in the olive

oil; then strain the oil. melt the

spermaceti and wax in it. When
nearly cold, put in the oil of lav-

,ender, and stir till quite firmly
set,"

A heroic remedy for freckles is
this: “Scrape horseradish into a
cup of cold sour milk, let it stand
twelve hours, strain, and apply
two or three times a day; but this
remedy is painful, and- must be
used with care."

l “No Essenbee?"

“Please notify the business
office of the Scarlet and Black
if «you are not receiving your
paper." requested Bennet Brink,
business manager of the paper,
this morning.

“We are making an effort to
check up on the efficiency of
the delivery system, and we
want to know whether or not
everyone has been getting his
or her paper."
