Reporter Discovers
Zoological Tendencies

in Hemi Book

It really is a Herd Book. if you
count up all the animal surnames
appearing in the Grinnell college
student directory. And not only
that, it’s an aviary as well.

The Grinnell zoo boasts two
Badgers, Bruce and Cleve: three
Bairs, Cuhby, Teddy and Bob:
and even a Brown Barr. There are
two Fox's. Edwin and Mary: an
Oliphant—Harve; s WolfeiLois:
and a ’CnoniBob,

Not quite in the zoo line, but
certainly related. is Dorothy
Furry; and Betty Herd belongs in
the book if anyone does.

Birds of a feather are the three
Martins, Lois, Jean and Everett.
We have a Drake, usually called
Dick; a Heron who answers to
B’Ann, a Robyn Dare, and a Pea»
cock called Warren.

And just so the aviary can be
kept in order. we find Bill Fowler's
name among those present.

Clever Lines in Farce

Monday Night

By Carl A. Niemeyer

In Spite of the presence in the
audience on Monday night of a. re-
porter from the Des Moines Tri-
bune, the World premiere of ”No
Women Wanted” was pretty Strict-
ly a Grinnell affair. William F.
Davidson, a tnis‘tee of the college,

Real Trouping

The old adage of the stage,
"the show must go on" was
carried on Monday night by
members of the cast of "No
Women Wanted.”

A momentary cn'sis arose in
the last act of the play when
the campus was thrown into
darkness by a general failure of
the lighting system for a few
minutes. Two players. Elorabel
Huston and Jack Spies were on
the stage at the time, but de
spite the sudden pitch darkness
continued to give their lines as
if nothing had happened.

The lights came on shortly
and the play continued as if
nothing had happened.

nately small, may have had before
the curtain rose some moments of
doubt about the success of the per-
formance. for they had heard fre»
quent revisions of the play during
rehearsals and of last moment
changes in the cast. But not long
after 3:30 o'clock their doubts
were set at rest as the play re»
vealed itself to be the most finish-
ed Grinnell production of the year.

farce, simple, unashamed andi

first act, are really funny; and if
the characters as is usually true in
farce are merely types, the types
have at least been sketched in a
clear effective way. The fickle
young lover (Carter Kirk), his
kindly father (Leroy Moore), the
backwoodsman dispensing gener-
