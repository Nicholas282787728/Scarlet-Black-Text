By Lorraine Buckman.

Last night the Girls’ Glee club.
trained under the direction of
George L. Pierce, professor of pia—
noforte, gave its twentyel-linth an-
nual spring concert in Herrick
chapel. An unusually diversified
program was presented. and the
quality of the work was highly
pleasing, both in the ensemble and
in the contributions of the several
soloists.

Breaking the long-established
custom of appearing on the plat-
form under the glare of ghastly
spotlights, the concert of last eve»
ning was lighted by house and
stage flood lights which preserved
the appearance of the performers
delightfully well, The admonish-
ment of last year's critic to "b
yourselves, girls," was noted with
splendid effect,

The club proper sang four
groups, of which the two Negro
spirituals were the high spots of
the program. Mary Elizabeth
Kienholz. the soprano soloist in the
group, is to be especially commend
ed for the pollshedvqua’lity of her
singing. Eleanor Steen, Violoncele
lo soloist, likewise showed real ar~
tistry, both in her solos, and in the

Is Glee Club

obligato for the enscmhle selection
“The Birth or the Opal", by C. G.
Reed.

A feature enjoyed by the aud-
ience was the quartet, composed of

son. Phyllis Burton and Marian
Kregel, who sang three light songs
with admirable abandon and obe
vious personal pleasure.

No other soloists, in the per-
sons of Rehecca Neff and Mary
Janice Meneray, added variety to
the program: Miss Neff. soprano,
with three songs or pleasing style;
and Miss Menerzy with three bril-
liant selections for harp.

The flnal ensemble, Grieg's "A
l Spring Cycle,” was particularly en-
joyable, and was presented with
,meticulcus care to detail. This was
{the longest appearance made by
the club, but not once did the cycle
approach the tedium, and audience
interest was heightened with two
soprano solos by Mary Fox and
iMargaret Wesson,

The entire concert gave evidence
of intensive work, and the arrange-
ment of the program was planned
lwisely throughout to meet the ex
lacting taste of crinnell's mus-:c
audience. The personnel of the
,glec club is to be congratulated on
J the presentation of one of the most
polished concerts this critic has at.
{tended on the campus; and Mr
'Pierce is to be recognized [or ,a
superb piece of direction.
