STUDENT LEADERSHIP? '7

‘rrinnell students are beginning to realize that the most
important thing which is needed on the campus right now is
col . trnctive student leadership

Lollditiolls on the i-alnpus during the past several yours
have shown the student body that this is necessary.

But how may we define this phi-3307“constructive stu-
dent leadership?” lll his book ”The Art 0]: Leallel'slllp.”
Ordway Tedd defines it as “the activily of influencing people
to cooperate towards some goal which they come to find de~
pliable.”

DOGS Grillnell leadership meet tlli requirelncllt‘,7 it has
been all too often in the past that while ill a few cases student
leadership has been destructive, it has rarely been construe
live. Grinnell student leaders are not progressixc for little
effort has been made to improve our student government and
few seem to care to improve it.

Grinnell needs progressive, el‘eu radical. student leaders
if our government is to be effective and workable.

YOUTH IN POLITICS
(Syracuse Daily Orange)

since 1932, between 7,000,000 and 3,000,000 men and women
have attained the voting age of 21. They are becoming the objects
of enthusiastic wooing by both major parties while the presidential
campaign warms up.

Inherited party allegiances are shifting as party labels lose their
rigidity. Important changes in party allignmcnt are under way
which may assume major proportions as new voters are influenced
by young people's clubs organized by political parties.

Young Democratic clubs of America were recognized in 1932 by
the Democratic National committee as its official "youth affiliate.”
In its 3,300 individual clubs, besides states, county and city organi-
zations, present membership between the ages of 21 and 40 has been
reported as about 3,000,000. ‘

The Republican National committee recognized the prospective
influence of younger voters by setting up a Young Republican divi—
sion on Nov. 1, 1935. As the party out of power, the G.0.P,‘s “youth
drive" started a good deal later than did that of its rival,

Formation and recognition of these young political groups
shows the great respect party leaders have for the youth of today
and the extent to which they are depending on them for the success
or failure of their candidates Yet. voting students take sur-
prisingly little interest in these gatherings.

Meetings of such youth clubs are held in Syracuse now and will
be continued at least until fall elections. In these groups college
students mayifind instructors willing and anxious to explain the
merits and demerits of parties and their respective candidates By
attending meetings of all parties and passing judgment on them
personally, students may help exercise the important influence an-
ticipated for youth in electing future government leaders.

tive which led to the suicide of a
