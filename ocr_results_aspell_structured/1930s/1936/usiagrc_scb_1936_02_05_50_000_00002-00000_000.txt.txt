standing advantage of this pro-
gram is that it will not permit the
piling up of hours in one or more
departments as has been the case
in the past, but will provide a
greaterdiversification, Miss Moe
Candless explained. '

“In surveying the credits of
many or the present seniors it
was found that they could have
changed easily to the new plan
without any serious inconvenir
ence," Miss McCandless said this
morning when discussing whether
or not the new change will cause
any serious inconvenience.
present freshmen will he able teas»
ily to change to the new~systeni
without any trouble at all," she
declared.

Three Divisions

The new graduation require-
ments fall into three di ions:

First, each student will be res
quired to take a year each of
freshman English. orientation and
foreign language. For the latter
requirement twc years of high
school foreign language will be
satisfactory.

Second, during his first two
years each student will he required
to distribute his study in such a
manner as to complete a full
year's Work in at least one sub-
ject in six of the following seven
groups: (1) art, music, speech.
drama; (2) English (composition
or literature); (3) French, Ger-
man, Greek, Italian. Latin, Span-
ish (beginning courses will not
count except, in Greek: (4) blo-
logy. chemistry; (5) physics,
mathematics; (6) economics, his-
tory, political science, sociology
(7) philosophy, history of philos-
ophy, psychology.

Major, Minor Ahouahod

Third, the old system of calm
pleti'ng a major and a minor
study, often unrelated, ls abol-
ished. Instead, each student must
complete from 40 to 52 hours in a
"field of concentration." From 24

iiThe i

ito 36 of these hours must be in
{subjects in one department and at
ilcast 16 hours must be in courses
irclatcd .or supplementary to them,
but in one or two other depart-
-ments. At least 40 hours‘ work
,must be in advanced courses.
"This is the first gencral
,clrange in the college curriculum
‘since 1510," according to Miss
Mccandless. "The entire idea of
the plan is to have one course tak-
en thmughout the entire year,"
she explained today.

Similar to other Plans

The plan recently adopted is
similar to ones already in use at
Pomona and Coe colleges, but is
not exactly alike, being instead,
specially adapted to Grinnell con-
ditions.

The plan was worked out by
Miss Mccandiess upon the stig-
gestion of the faculty committee
on educational policies, which is
headed by Mr. Paul S. Wood. oth»
er members of the committee are
Mr. Roy H. Perring, Mr. Henry
S. Conard, Mr. Robert H. Norton
and Mr. Earl D. Strong.

Steiner Urges

”Then," Dr. Steiner continued,
"there was corruption as there is
today, not there Was also a native
refinement—dignity_and g r e a t
faith in God, the world and man."
which is lacking today,

The speaker recalled that the
process of his becoming an Amer»
iciul came under the inspiration
of Lincoln's life and tragic death.
with the obtaining of his citizen-
ship papers his childish dreams of
a super-humanly perfect Ameri-
can came to an end, and his strug-
gle to find a better America and
point it out to others became his
paramount interest.

Dangers Within

Dr. Steiner declared that while
dangers do exist in the United
states they exist only within the
country. and do not assail it from

As illustrative of the attitude
Europeans have toward citizens
of tile Unitel Statcs, he told at a
conversation with a European in
which he criticized America se-
verely for the existing gratt and
corruption in all fields. The re-
ply of his companion was, “You
ought to be on your knees to thank
God you are in America."

No change will be made in the
method of charging, Mr. Nollen
said yesterday. The system of blan-
ket charges which was installed
two years ago will continue, he ex-
plained.

“The response from the parents
to the increase in price has beenl
uniformly favorable," Mr Nollen
saiiii when queried about the atti-
tudes of the parents.

“Tilt increase in charges will

in the deductions for workers who

the possible effects upon jobs.
