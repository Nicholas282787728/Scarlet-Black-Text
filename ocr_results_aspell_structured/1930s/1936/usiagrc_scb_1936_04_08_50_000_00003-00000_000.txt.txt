THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Dogs Are Nice Pets
But Not on Tmins
Faculty Members Find

Dogs are not welcome on trains,
two crinnell facility members dis-
covered during the recent vacation
Miss Ollie Backus, instructor in
speech, tried to take her pup on a
train after an accident to her car,
but found the conductor adamant,
So she took a bus to another sta-
tion, only to find it closed and no
way of checking the dog.

It was a long, cold ride in bag—
gage cars and coach platforms for

Miss Backus and the ,pup, until,

finally someone had the idea of
putting the dog in the baggage
car, marked COD, for Grinnell.

Miss Leone Crosby, instructor in
physical education for women, res
cued a friend's Scottie on a Mexi-
can train about the same time. An
irate conductor refused to let the
pup ride “as was," so Miss Crosby
emptied a large cardboard box
which was part of her luggage and
the pup rodc happily in that. His
only other adventures were fright:
ening the Mexican porter, and es-
caping into the sleeping car by
mistake.
