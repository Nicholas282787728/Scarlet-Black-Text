Juniors to Plan
Vocations Class
for Next Year

The final meeting of the vocals
tions class, organized tor the first
time this spring, will be held Fri-
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. at
that time members of the junior
class are expected to be present in
order to begin plans for a similar
series of meetings next year!

The class hopes to have as a
guest speaker Friday Louis Brown-
low, chairman of the Public Ad—
ministration Clearing house at
Chicago, ill, If. he is not able to
attend, some other staff member
of the Clearing house will speak.

The special topic for the week
will be “Public Administration,”
and the discussion will be based
primarily on the new movement
and effort being made by the gov—
ernment to manage state, city,
and municipal affairs on a non-
political basis.

Mr Brownlow was asked by
Pres, Franklin D. Roosevelt to
take over this problem of adminis-
tration in order to train young
people for government positions
on a basis of civil service rather
than political dickering. There

* definitely will be these jobs in
Civil Service in the very near fu—
ture. and it is hoped that Friday’s
meeting will interest students in
jobs that this experiment will offer,
" John P. Ryan, professor of pub
lic speaking, will preside at the
afternoon forum, while Richard
‘Dl'ake ’36, will be student chair-
man of the meeting.

All juniors are urged to be pres-
ent to begin the organization of
next year’s class, Drake ans
nounced.
