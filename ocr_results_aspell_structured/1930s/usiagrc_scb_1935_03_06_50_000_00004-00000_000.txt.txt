WEDNESDAY, MARCH 0 1935.

THE GEINNELL S ARLET AND BLACK

 

Unusually Fine
cValley Quintets
Predicted for ’36

While the Missouri Valley confer—
ence basketball race in 1935 was one
oi the closest in years, the prospects
for 1935 point to such general strength
in the loop that even closer competi.
tion tor the title seems in the oiiing.
ll next year does not produce a more
exciting battle for,the championship,
it is at least assured that it will take
a better team to win than it did this
year.

Grinnell, losing Mason, Frye and Du
Mont irom this year’s outlit, will he
the most weakened team in the con.
ference. Coach John Tiuesdale must
depend upon the rapid development oi
members of the prep squad if the Pio.
neeis are to enjoy as exalted a position
next year as they did this season.

The iinest array oi teams since the
secession oi the Big Six is promised
ior the Valley next year. A glance
over the general prospectus is enough
t'o scare any coach.

All Bulldogs Back

Drake loses not a single member of
its title.sharing crew, retaining Me.
Cloud, Swan, Parisho, Crebaugh and
Xanders, and has some very promising
newcomers coming up from the prep
squad.

The same situation exists at Creigh.
ton, where the other hall oi the cham.
pionship resides. Captain Mike
o'Leary is lost by graduation, but he
was not talented enough to rate a reg.
ular position this year. On the other
hand, all ﬁve oi the men who saw the
'niost service will return—Engelbretson,
Lomax, Trish. Mclver and Busch. To
top that off, the Jays irosh team this
year includes every member oi the
1933 Kenosha, Wis. high school iive
which won the state title in ’33, and
which has been deieating all comers
this season.

Washington Strong

Coach Don White at Washington also
will have n iull team of experienced
men to start the season with next year.
included in the group will be the 1935
scoring champ, Roy Martintoni; the
others are Hudgens, Sauer, Ozment,
and Drake. With all these veterans,
Coach White expects to start winning
away from home as well as on the
Bears‘ ﬂoor—where all his '35 wins
were gainedewhen next season rolls
around.

Probably the most improved team in
the loop will be the Oklahoma Aggies
outﬁt, acording to advance dope. Coach
Henry Ibn claimed during his northern
trip this year that he had a ireshman
team that could score on his varsity
without any trouble and which once
ran up a 29.9 count on the regulars
in a briei practice scrimmage. When
one recalls that this year’s Cowboys
presented by ior the strongest defense
in the conference, the iull import oi
that story is only too plain.

Four regulars are returning at Wash.

Bethe]. This team was developing iast
toward the end oi the past season, and
with reinforcements lroin the treshmcn
must be put down for at. least as
strong a team as this year. Tulsa, too,
was showing steady improvement and
is expected W have a better team in
1936.

season, is a standout tor the center
post on the first team, selection oi a
second team choice is more difficult.
It is given to Dittemore of Washbum,
whose play on a weak team makes him
a worthy selection. Both Bauer ol

have iustiiied claims to the position.
but both were members of stronger
outfits and neither showed up any bet.
ter than the lanky lchnbod.
Strirlden Transferred

Suichlen. oi the Aggies is placed at
guard along with awe oi Grinnell and
Orebaugh oi Drake, though he did not
really play this position. His de.
fensive play was one oi the reasons
the Cowboys were so strong in this
department. however. Drye was
doubtlessly the best deicnsivc guard
in the conference, while Orcbaughwas
not only a fine deiensive player but
a, regular point contributor as well.

Little of the Aggies and 'Disll of
Creighton are obvious choices ior
posts on the second team, but the third
selection might be disputed. Hudgens
of Washington is placed therebecause
oi his improved work during the last
oi the season, which aided very ma.
terially in the Bears’ wins over
Drake, Creighton and Grinnell.13usch
of Creighton, Xanders of Drake and
Bowen oi Tulsa were also outstanding
guards.
