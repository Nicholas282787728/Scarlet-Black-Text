One oi our iondest notions received
a rather severe jolt today as a re.
sult oi a conversation with a dean in
one at the more prominent graduate
business schools in the East. We
had always iirroly believed that. irom
the standpoint oi the business man.
there was little value in his reading
in subjects which did not particularly
per‘lzin to some aspect oi his busi.
ness. This edueator declared that
the evenincreasing complexity oi busi.
ness relationships demanded a broad
background in iields which apparent.
ly have no connection with commer.
cial concerns. He suggested that a
student might be properly introduced
to this wider concept it he “browsed
about” the curriculum and supple.
mented his required wark with a good
deal oi reading done on his own in.
itiative. As an easy introduction to
the probably proiitable and surely
pleasurable habit oi daily reading. we
suggest that you select a book, a cur.
rent best seller, available on the rental

sheli oi the college library.

swam ’A’HE SOLDIER by P. c.
Wren. There is something about a
blood and thunder story of thrilling
adventure that quickens the pulse oi
the most stodgily civilized oi us. Most
oi us ilnd that in gaining the security
and oorntort of modern lite we have
lost the deep satisiaeticn inherent in
situations in which survival is de.
pendent upon a nimble brain, a strong
right arm, and a whispered prayer,
Gentlemen like Mr. Wren are always
ready to supply that hunger ior ac.
tion and adventure and, armed only
with a pipe and an armchair, we iind
ourselves tramping with the :roreign
Legion across the burning sands oi the
Sahara as Mr, Wren points out the
indications oi a real skirmish ahead.

In this book. Dysart, the hero oi Mr.
Wren's works titled ”Action" and
“Passion," continues the story of his
adventures. He embarks upon a ca.
reer oi gun.running, is captured by
desert Arabs, sold into slavery, and
acquired by a strange white sultan.
becomes Chandros‘ story and a very
interesting one it is. Like the other
Wren sbories, the book is remarkable
for therextent of ﬁrst—hand knowledge

 

the author seems to have oi exotic
lands and their barbaric peoples.
. . . .

FOOLSCAP ROSE by Joseph
nergesheimer. This is the story oi a
Pennsylvania paper mill and the iam.
ily that owned it. in the beginning
Hamel Wigton produced handmade
papers only and all his iantily worked
in the mill. Later came Jacob Kinzer
who married one oi the Wigton girls
and after the founder’s death was abIe
to introduce machinery. Finally, at.
ter a hundred years had passed, the
paper mill had become a trust, sub.
ject to Wall Street, and the family
had decayed.

The best of this book is the begin.
ning with its amusing and timely p0.
Iitical talk and a number of convincing
and logical characterizations. Later.
the Kinzers and their relatives be.
come a trifle dull and the author
seems to be in a quandary over' the
fate of Amasa Kinzer.

We liked the book chieily because
we felt it to be an admirable psy.
chological study oi the deterioration
oi moral values as the growth oi a
business enterprise made ior a decline
in the sense oi trustee.ship toward the
stockholders and employees, and the
repercussions of this moral laxity in
the daily lives oi those most concern.

When strangers meet

I bréak the rige

You like me best because I am
so mellow, rich, ﬂavorful. She
Chooses me in preference to
other cigarettes for another
reason; because I am so mild
and easy on her throat. But you
both prefer me because I am
mad: cxclusively from fragrant,

expensive center leaves. That’s
why I’m milder. That’s why I
taste better. Notop leaves, unripe
and stinging; no bottom leaves,
coarse andsandy, are permitted
to destroy my uniform mildness
and good taste. I’m your best
friend. I am your Lucky Strike.
