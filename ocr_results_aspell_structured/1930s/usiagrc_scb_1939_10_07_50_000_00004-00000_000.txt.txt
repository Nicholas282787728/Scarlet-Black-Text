After losing 17 yards in three
plays. due to a penalty, Swan
punted to Walters, who returned
the ball to the Pionccr 47. ,An
exchange of several punts brought
the ball to the Drake 42, with the
Bulldogs in possession.

The Drake Steamroller then
threw itself into high gear and,
began its first touchdown march‘
of the game. After seven plays,‘
Drake had crossed the Pioneer-
goal line with Fisher scoring the
points. However, Swan failed to
convert the extra. point and the
score at the end of the quarter
stood, Drake 6, Grinnell 0.

SECOND QUARTER:

The second quarter opened up
with Grinnell in possession of the
ball on its own 3d~yard line.
After several attempts at gaining-
ground by rushing, Hamann punt-
ed out of bounds on the Drake
34-yard marker. For the second‘
time in the game, the home teaml
put on a march for a touchdown
which went as far as the Pioneeri
20, at which point it was reversed
by a 15-yard penalty for holding.
Grinnell intercepted a Drake pass,
giving the visitors the ball on
their own 28.

After advancing to the Pioneer
40-yard stripe, the longest Grin-l
nell march so for in the game,
Ed Walters tossed a pass whichi
landed in the Waiting hands of‘
Fisher. who returned it to mid-
field. At this point, the Grinnell
line began to hold and proved it-
self equal to anything that Drake
could offer.

An exchange of punts found
the ball resting on the Drake 12-
yard stripe, in the home teams
possession. Drake then kicked to
the Grinncll 43, where Walters
took it to the Drake 43 for a
first down. A Grihnell pass
found its way into Drake
hands, and the half ended with
Drake in possession of the ball.
THIRD QUARTER:

Drake again kicked off
Ed Walters carried it up to
28-yard marker. After being pe-
nalized 15 yards for holding,
Grinnell, with Hamann doing the
task, punted to midfield where
the ball was taken by Fisher and
brought back to the scarlet and
black 45, Again, on successivel
gains by Fisher, the Bulldogs
fought their way up to the Grin-
nell nine-yard stripe where a
Drake fumble was recovered by
Jorgensen, Grinnell end.

Barker punted out of danger
up to midfield where Fisher
caught the punt to return it to
the Grinnell 46. Once more a
Drake threat became imminent
when the ball was advanced from
the 45 to the 11-yard stripe. The
Grinncll line once more held, and
after an incomplete Drake pass,
took possession of the pigskin.

By Aline White.

Just by way of introduction, this
is the new column which has firi-
ally slipped past the editor's nose
and into the printing room, Which
shows to go you that the femmcs
can do most anything if they set
their minds to it and wait a few
years,
iv. A. A.

The freshmen have at last not
iced the 1897 on Rand gymnas-
ium, and they've discovered that
the gym as a whole just doesn't
come up to the smooth creation
they called a similar name back
at Foduuk High. So we did a
little research which led us out
to West street and ploughed
ground but got a lot of enlight-
ening information.

w. A A.

It seems there was a day when
ole Grinnell did not have a wo-
men’s gym (in spite of reports
that is was the first building on
the campus.) Instead, the young
ladies had to trot from the Quad
(which then consisted of Mcars)
down to the old armory on Fifth
avenue. The armory is no more,
but Fifth avenue still exists (and
for the info of you guys that
don't know, it's plenty far away).
But that isn’t the half of it.
Gracing each leg of the girls
were four full yards of goods in
the form of-uh-bloonicrs, and
long, black sc~en thread cotton
hose kept pr ng inalc eyes from
seeing too much.

w. A. A.

In 1397, the year of the gym’s
debut, the sportswnmcn gingerly
clasped a big round ball, and
basketball for females was offi-
cially introduced on the Gtinnell
campus. It was the first sport
besides swinging dumb-bells ever
to take place in the new gym.
Believe you us, those gals were
plenty proud. They were so
proud, in fact, they would allow
no one to walk on the floor with-

out tennis shoes. For all acti-
vities requiring the use of leather
soled shoes, the floor was care-
fully covercd with canvas.

w. A, A.

Ah, but times have changed,
and we do mean changed. The
skimpy jobs that clothe today's
gals when they take phys. ed,
would rate a good old Eighteenth
Century blush, and tame, lady-
like sports are past history a
which leads us to the subject of
intramurals right here in the
fall of 1939.

w, A, A.

If you tiiink football is inur-

der, you should see a female

of wholesale massacre. Those
gals really scrap it out out what
fun they have! Intramural prac-
tices are in progress at present,
and to all those who are the
least bit afraid they'll get hurt
in the fray, we promise them
one ivholc dozen of the best five

any color they desire. And to
those who ain't scored 0' nothin',
we promise three weeks of riot-
ous fun. So come on you gals
iput on that cottage spirit and
those shin guards and join us on
the hockey field next Saturday
morning.
