Solution for Japan

What then is the solution to Jar
pan’s problem? ”Two things, olimited
population and internationalism, will
save Japan. These factors are inter-
woven. Internationalism would sub-
due its fear of other countries, and
thus reduce the necessity of support—
ing a huge population. International-
ism is being created all the time,"
concluded Mr. Page, “We’re growing

RELAXATION OF LIBRARY REGULATION

The Scarlet and Black last year came out
strongly in favor of modiﬁcation of the rule pro-
hibiting students to enter the library stacks. This
year the paper’s policy still holds. It may be re-
membered that no immediate removal of the rule
was desired. The modiﬁcation suggested was that
students should take no books into the stacks, and
should account for all books carried out.

It was further recommended that tile tables
and chairs he removed from the stack rooms in
order to discourage social assemblage. The Scarlet
and Black, realizing the limitations of this plan,
but relying on the ingenuity of the library adminis-
tration to ﬁll in the weal: places, repeats the re
quest for modiﬁcation.

There are several factors which seem to justify
an early change of the rule. Til the ﬁrst pla , the
announcement of the rule, as it appeared in The
Scarlet and Black Jail. 8, 1930, read that the sys-
tem would be in effect “throughout: the school
year.” The rule has been adhered to now for twice
as long as was originally announced, and no state-
ment has been issued to uphold this extension.

Another justification for changing now is that
the necessity is over, so far as the rule call mect' it.
TVllile students still remember writing the ﬁrst
paper without free recourse to the stacks. and
while they still realize the original purpose of the
rule, it would be wise to test, for a while at least,
the studellts’ honesty.

The Scarlet and Black is not alone in desiring
relaxation of the library regulation. Other organi-
zations are planning to take deﬁnite steps for its
accomplishment. The paper merely adds its word
to the others in the clearing up of this real campus
problem.

READ OFFICIAL NOTICES

Official announcements are included in the
news columns of: The Scarlet and Black because it
is the best medium of reaching every student in
Grinnell college. Yet, although this is true, there
are times when those announcements are not seen
and the iminformed student complains of not being
notiﬁed.

Bulletin board announcements are only model‘s
atcly effective. There are few students who follow
the boards religiously, although many do glance at
them occasionally. Dining room announcements
are likewise only partially effective. Too often
students do not eat at the dormitories or quad-
rangle, either regularly or at the time when the
speciﬁc announcement in which they are interested
is read.

The Scarlet and Black circulation covers the
college thoroughly. Despite the plea of the busir
ness manager to “read your own S. 8: B.,” it i.
still possible to borrow your roommatc’s copy or
to scan one from a room across the hall for in-
formation regarding campus activities.

Legality of Sunday dates, faculty rulings, and
student meetings are all included in the ofﬁcial
notices. As it is the duty of a good. citizen to keep
in touch with the activities of his fellows, so it i
the duty of a good eollezian to follow the activities
on his campus. Ofﬁcial announcements will tell
what is being done.

ARE GU'NMEN' TYPICAL?

Sinclair Lewis wrote “Babbitt7 and made a
standard American business man, He wrote
“Main Street” and created a small towln type.
In the last decade America has become more or less
a nation of typesito authors. There is the college
late type, the professional type, the. bulldog type,
and the criminal type.

Recently two writers tried to picture the
American gangster, O. O, McIntyre says, “The
1931-model gunman is more often than not a chick-
cn-brcastcd Broadway gigolo typeAubercnlar and
otherwise diseased. At heart he is a in erablc
coward and a ‘suitcll.’ Few have the natural bravA
ado of the outlaws of the western plainsvllcalthy,

enough to hold the weight of 10 men. IIis eyes are
two narrow slits, palc gray.”

Call this be a gulllllim of ther“chieltelrbreosted
gigolo type?” Perhaps America isn’t such a set
of stereotyped ﬁgures as ‘ILICS would like the
public to believe. Individualism may run rampant,
and if some author does lnnlte the individual he
sees a type it doesn’t necessarily lncan that it
must be ed intact throughout.

ICE SKATING ON WARD FIELD

Grinnell has few winter sports that the student
body as a ’wholc may enjoy and take all active part
ill. One sport it e'auld have that is cxlliliratillg,
clean. healthful, and open to almost every ollc is
ice skating. When it has been suggested before
that Grinnell provide an ice skating rink for its an,
tllusiasts of the sport, various objections have
been raised, but this year with the lighting of
\Vartl field r night football there is more reason
than ever for urging that the gridiron be flooded,

Tile plea has often been made that floodingr a
field destroys the grass. However, it has been the

pericnre of many park olficals in the larger cit-
ies that no damage is (lone as long as breaks do not
occur ill the ice. Grinncll would not encounter the
difficulty, for the football field is level enough that
there would he no danger of ice lire: ' .

If the difficulty of getting water to the grid-
iron stands ill the way, the Gr lncll city fire de-
partment is undoubtedly public spirited enough to
loan hose to the college, ’

With the field ouec ﬂooded, the college could
announce a day or two in ad 'llK‘t‘, the evening that
the lights would be on for skating. A\ small admis-
sion fee might be charged to pay for the current
used.

Each year the question of a skating rink for Grille
ilcll is brought up by some one, and so far nothing
has been done. If there is all obstacle ill the way
of the project, the reason should be made publ .

A WORLD MINDED MAN
(From the Daily Iowan)

Provincialism is probably the aptest “ism" coined
in derision of the aspect of American life about which
Sinclair Lewis wrote “Main street." Particularly has this
term been ﬂung at what Henry Louis Mencken densiver
ly calls the “Bible belt.”

University of Iowa students are likely to suffer
for more than they would admit from provincialism, the
mental state of not looking much beyond your own
backyard fence, or getting your nation of what is on the
other side from a knot hole perspective,

A speaker is on the campus today and tomorrow
who was educated in this state. At Drake university he
was student and secretary of Prof. Herbert Martin, now
acting head of Iowa's philosophy department, whose ad-
miration and respect he has.

Although a citizen of the United states in a politi-
cal sense. Kirby Page knows the world as a neighbor-
hood, He, personally, has visited several dozen foreign
nations and their leaders of thought and action. Few
men are better informed on intematioual affairs, few
men less limited in their views.

If there are any speakers capable of jarring college
youth from its typical complacency, Kirby Page is one
of them. The opportunity is not. only good enough to
be seized: it is too good to be overlooked.

MISSOURI NEWSHAWKS
(From the Time magazine)

To the outsider who thinks at random of St. Louis
newspapers, the names of the venerable Globe-Democrat
or progressive (Pulitzer) Post—Dispatch come to mind.
But throughout the last fortnight both great papers
were soundly larruped on st, Louis‘ newstory-of-the-
month—possibly its story of the year: the kidnapping
and return of 13~year-old Adolphus Busch Orthwein,
grandson of famed August A. Busch. The sheet that
ran away with the story was the loud, energetic st.
Louis Star.

The star's heat was another personal exploit of
its ace, Reporter Harry Thompson andidge, who
achieved some note last summer by telling a Chicago
Grand jury that the murdered Alfred “Jake" Lingle was
by no means Chicago's only racketeering newsman;
that he had found a dozen others who worked hand-in-
glove with the underworld.

In the st. Louis kidnap case little Adolphus was
secretly restored to his parents only 20 hours after
his disappearance. Possibly through his own friendship
—or that of his managing editor, Frank W. Taylor7
with the Busch family, Reporter B‘rundidge learned that
the name of Pearl Abernathy, a local Negro real estate
dealer, had been mentioned in the Busch houshold. Next
day the Star blazed out its ﬁrst scoop: “Negro Real
Estate Mart Exposes Own Son (Charles) As Abductur."
Also it printed nearly a full front page of pictures of
the room where the boy had been held.

Next; day Reporter Brundidge was following a hot
tip that led to a furnisher room hideaway in Kansas
City. Two days later he had Charles Abernathy's eon-
fessioniwnh a hand written note from Abernathy to
the reporter for a front-page splash. Then he led St.
Louis ofﬁcers to their quarry.

Goodrlooking, sclf—eunﬁdent, Reporter Brundidgc,
36. is well liked by most st. Louis newsmen, but some-
times suspected by his opponents of faking. His critics
point 'to his ostensibly intimate interview with Gangster
Al Capone at Miami—which Capone promptly denied.
But his friends insist that Capone talked as reported,
With the stipulation that he would deny it to save his
own face. other Bruudidge exploits: expose of the mid-
west medical “diploma mill” scandals of 1924; conviction
in 1924 of Ray Renard (The Fox) of the notorious Egan
gang, and the Solution thereby of 22 murders. Also in
1925 he got a job as deckband on a rumship plying be-
tween New Orleans and Havana, wrote thereafter a
series of articles on liquor smuggling.

The Star's opposition took its defeart in the Busch
case bitterly, the 'Iimes reputedly discharging Lhree re-
porters for falling down. The Globe—Democrat man had
even talked to the elder Abernathy, but could not make
him ‘talk “kidnap.” The Post—Dispatch had assigned its
own No. 1 newsman, and one not often bestcdilohu T.
Rogers.
