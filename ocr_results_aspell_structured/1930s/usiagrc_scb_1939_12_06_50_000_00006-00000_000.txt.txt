Improvement Seen.

“I feel," said Truesdale, “that I
can now make a prediction that
the experience and height of our
opponents will be the deciding
factor. After a few games we
will have a good basketball team."

The Cyclones already have two
decisive victories under their belts
this season. In the season's
opener, the Ames quintet hame
rncred Simpson’s Redmen to de-
feat by a score of out) as Bob
Harris, red—headed junior forward,
poured in 24 points, ably assisted
by (Jo-captain Nicholas, center,
and Al Biidolfson, forward, who
scored 19 and 13 potnts respective-

Morningside, Monday, the Cy-
clones smashed through to a 57-

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor:

I wish to compliment the Scar-
lct and Black for the clear,
straightforward and fair way in
which it commented editorially on
ci-innell football spirit in the Nov.
22 issue.

The fact remains, however,
that Griiincll teams are not ivi —
hing. Brit, what produces a wi .
hing football 1mm? Coaching
and iinioerinl are the groomst
_essentinls. As for the latter,

and; your uenspaper, the faculty and

students know better than I
how things stand this year.
Secondly, what produces spirit?
The one and only answer ia—n
riclorions team.

I look upon Coach Lookabaugh‘s
attack upon the student body as
unjust, and I agree with you that
“buck passing” seems to be pre
valent. Yet it is undeniably true
that spirit or enthusiasm cnn be
created only when there is some-
thing to be enthusiastic about! No
person. no matter how much he
loves Grinnell, can keep that spir-
ited fire of merely hopeful vic»

 

tory within him when his team
ties for second step to the base-
ment in the conference. The sit»
nation is the same in war when,
the armed forces failing to pro-
duce victory, the home front
breaks down and the l‘esull4e-
feat! The victorious army in the
field brings cheer at home, just
as the winning team fires a stud-
cnt body with enthusiasm. admir-
ation and cheer. Thus you have
school spirit.

A losing team and a defeated
coach have no power to promote
spirit, They are helpless, for
the response is gone. And when
that response dies, so does the
school’s spirit and reputation die
in the eyes of outsiders.

You did not miss it far when
you forecast the probability of
the Iowa conference and six-man
football. I hope the Scarlet and
Black, students and faculty will
attempt to seek a solution to a
situation which is greatly injur-
ing a college which I dread to see
linrt
love thee in defeat," True, but it
also says we will “cheer for thee
in each Victory"!
