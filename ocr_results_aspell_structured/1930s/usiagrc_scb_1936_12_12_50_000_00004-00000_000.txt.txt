NEW EDUCATION TEGHNIQUES

Flodlng a job, that problem which has always been
paramount in the minds of the members of every college
gl-adutttin ' class, was recently discussed by Howard Vin-
cent O’Brien in his Chicago Daily News column ”All
Things Considered."

In Mr. O'Brien’s opinion the present situation calls
for a focusing of the attention of employers on the prob-
lems of youth, not so much to help in the selection of
suitable occupations as to help in providing occupation of
any sort, He contends that the real task of the educator
is not primarily to educate the young to at proper choice
of career but “to educate employers to an intelligent use
of the human material in their hands.”

Mr. O’Brien points out that the general public here-
tofore has always assumed that when a college graduated
at student the task of education was completed, whereas
“quite obviously, it has only begun." It is interesting to
note his conception of the function of education, for he
feels that if properly understood, the process of education
\‘lﬁuldl continue throughout the lifetime of every indi-
Vl 1151 r

“The college graduate would not be considered a
finished product, but ,only raw material for further edu-
cation in the economic process The schools would use
their machinery to develop the individual as consumer;
industry and the professions would use their machinery
to develop him as producer.” According to Mr. O’Brien,
when business wakens ’to the advantages of education
within itself, it will end one form of economic waste. It
naturally follows that the present—day employer must
acquire a new concept of his lcsponsibility to society, and
also there must be initiated a new technique of education

YOUR CUE FOR CHRISTMAS

When you pass :1 Salvation Army Santa Claus with
his kettle standing on a street corner during the holidays,
do you stop to give him a few coins? When your church
asks for white gifts of canned fruit for its poorer consti-
tuents, do you pay any heed to that call? Too often the
answer is “no."

Shut out from close connection with city slums, we
on the campus are apt to forget to what extent many
families will suffer during the coming winter. We are
engrossed with Christmas gift selections for the family
and our own circle of friends giving little thought to
those whose Christmas is dependent upon community
welfare agencies.

Why not make this Christmas season your cue to
come out from hiding, take cognizance of your commun-
ity’s situation, and contribute your share to the general
welfare? —J. P.
