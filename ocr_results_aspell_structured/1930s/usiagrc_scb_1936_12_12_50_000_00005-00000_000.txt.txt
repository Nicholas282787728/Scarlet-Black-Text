New Clock Installed
for Basketball Games

If you want to know how
much time is left in the genre
tonight, you can find out ex;
actly for a change.

That is, you can find out if
you bother to look at the new
automatic clock, regulated by
a switchboard on the ofrioial
desk, which is being put into
use for the first time tonight.

The automatic tiriie clock is
the regular oiie taken from the
football scoreboard, and has a
white race with the numbers
in black. a red second hand
and a black minute hand in-
dicate the minutes and the
actual number of seconds left
to play.

The clock was developed by
“Ike" Palmer, engineer and
electrician at the heating
plant.

Romance on Wheels May Result
in Increace in Liniment Sales

Arrival of Roller Skates
at Quad Begins New ‘
Recreation Era I

.i l

Sales of liniment are going to
increascitlie 60 pairs of roller»‘
skates ordered by the quadrangle
social budget committee have ar-i
rived and are to lie put into use
the first Friday evening aftel'l
Christmas vacation. At least, the}
bumps and bruises probablyl
won't show, but there may be some:
stiffness and limping around the;
campus until students get back to
their childhood shill. ‘

The general idea was that there;
is nothing to do around here on a‘
week-end except go to a dance;
or a movie. Now, when couples;
are bored with open houses and‘
varsities, they can dash over tor
Rand gym and spend a merry even.
ing g-loding smoothly about the
floor to phonograph music.

Romance on wheels

Romance on wheels, you might
call it. But the skates aren't only
for dates—groups of women may
reserve them any other night dur-
ing the week by calling Lorene
Schoenmann, member of the mere-
ation committee. Mixed parties
may reserve them, too, for that
matter.

The skates have fiber wheels,

,becausc it was feared that iron Umvel'SIly of Delxoit

ones might damage the polish of
the gym floor.

Cost $171. .

Purchase of the skates for $174?

was approved by the women of thel '

quadrangle when they voted on the;
social budget in October, 1
Flber wheels won't be quite so1
noisy as iron ones, but the com-l
rnittce is nevertheless hoping tol
be able to install an amplifying‘
system so that the music can be
hear-d above the din of the thun-
dering mob.

To Sort Pairs.

The tallest basketball center and
the shortest woman at the quad)
can each find a pair to fit without
going through the trouble of ad»
justing the skates. since they are
going to be kept in specially-built
cabinets, assorted according to
length. But that doesn‘t mean
width; so the latest addition to
college key-rings may he a skate
key.

“Women can skate free, any
time they wish, but there will
probably be a small charge for
the men," Miss Schoenmann said.
However, it won't be enough to
break them up in business or to de-
tract from the popularity of the
idea.
