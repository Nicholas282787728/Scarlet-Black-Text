the opposite sex that there is in
Gl'innell, Dates there are looked
upon only from the viewpoint of
amusement and fun.
Week-End Pal-lies
Whenever there is a hoirse pare

Wellesley, Vassar and other girls'
schools. The parties are always
two or three day affairs The
freshmen move out of the dormi-
tories to hotels or rooming houses
and the girls live in the dormitor-
ies while there for the party.
"Dating is much more expensive
there. The party tax averages 55

No \l'eckly Dancing

Joe further explained that there

“Another custom there, which I

custom at Gl'inncll."

Joe concluded by explaining-
that students are quite cliouish at
Colgate, one's close acquaintances
being limited to members of the
fraternity to which he belongs.
