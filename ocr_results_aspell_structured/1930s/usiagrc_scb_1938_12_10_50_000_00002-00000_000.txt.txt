WHO'S T0 BLAME?

The big talk of last week, as far as the
men’s side of the campus is concerned, was
of the rifling of several rooms in Clark hall
while the hall picture was being taken. The
thief escaped with almost $20 in cash. Al-
though the incident did stir up the indigna-
ton of the college men, and especially that
of the victims, it would be unimportant and
hardly noteworthy if it were strictly an iso-
lated case.

The truth of the matter is that last week’s
incident is only one of many similar in-
stances, in the men’s halls at least, in which
students pay their tribute to a dishonest
person going through their rooms. Yet, res-
idents of nearly evely hall and cottage have
had the experience that the Clark hall men
had last week at some time in, let us say,
the last five years. Most of the times the
prowlers have been after cash, but occasion-
ally they have taken cameras, typewriters,
and other valuable personal property which
can easily be carried off The fact that
there are dishonest people at Grinnell, how-
ever unpleasant it may be, ought to be by
this time very well established in the minds
of students here.

In view of the fact that past experience
has shown us that dishonesty does exist on
the campus, and that students who leave
money in their rooms take a chance of los-
ing it, one solution is an obvious one—Carly
your money with you at all times, put it in
the bank, but do not try to hide it in your
rooms!

The second solution will have to be given
in the form of a criticism. House mothers
are too liberal with the house keys! It ap-
pears that anyone can get the house key at

any time with no questions asked. Often
times the keys are lost for long periods of
time. We admit that at times persons acci-
dently lock themselves out of their rooms;
and we admit that the house key must be
available for the bed—makers _

But the tragedy of the whole thing is
that the house keys are not used for only
these two things. The keys are obtained,
unknowingly by the house mothers, to stack
other fellows’ rooms, to double lock doors,
and to steal!

Some system must be worked out where—
by the house keys will be available only
whcn the house mother is in the hall, and
whereby they will be used only when the
house mother herself is present to see what
the key is being used for. It may even be
necessary to equip each bed-maker with a
house key with instructions that only he is
to use it; but would he disobey these in
structions and lend it out?

The problem is here for us to solve, and
we must solve it. Our only recommendation
at present is that students refrain from
leaving their doors unlocked and from leav-
ing their“ money in their rooms, and that
house mothers adopt a more conservative
attitude in “lending out” the house keys.

Some college dormitories and fraternity
houses do not even have locks on doors, and

no thefts are suffered It only goes to Show:

how a lock and key will arouse a person‘s
curiosity!

GRINNELL'S SCHOOL
OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS?

Some two or three weeks ago we took occa—
sion in these columns to point out that it
might be worth while from a student point
of view for the International Relations club
to sponsor a broader program during the
year to include all “Spects of political
questions in a well. let nced and informal
program. Whether interested students will
undertake such a program is still unknown.

In the meantime, is it not possible for
the college administration and faculty to
take the first steps toward a school (I) of
public affairs by making it possible for stu—
dents to ”major” or concentrate in a field
of knowledge equivalent to “public affairs,”
even though at the present time such
courses are scattered among the depart
ments of political science, economics, history
and sociology?

No doubt there are a number of students
who are not interested in majoring in his-
tory, economics, sociology, or political
science as such, but would be interested ill
a program of study dealing with the com-
plicated relationships of government, intgr»
national affairs, the economic system, and
public life in general.

Students in the past have been allowed
a field of concentration in natural sciences
that cut across departments. Why shouldn‘t
the various departments in the social
sciences make available an inter-depart»
mental plan of study in public affairs?

The Scarlet and Black believes that the
Cur“culum committee or the Educational
Policies committee would find it worth-
while to investigate the feasibility of this
plan or some plan that would approximate
the one suggested above.

flee of the dean says it is, maybe
the rest of us had better take up
jam'm', jivin’, and xug cuttin’ and
become scholarly jitterbugs. The
one bit of oppositlon is that

The band of jitterhugs at Carney
house are still jammin' aha jivin‘,
but it seems that these jitterbugs
are also book worms.

The little lads are “in the
groove” as m as learnin’ goes,
according to the latest informa-
tion received from the office of
the dean of men.

Carneyites, it is lccmcd, have
all the other halls on the campus
licked when it comes to hot only
"cattin'," but also grades with a.
2.03 average.

These erudite students seem to
have something on the hall bc—

slass rug-beating,

Not only do they have time for
their swlng and fast music, but
these bright and brainy hcys
really keep their noses th the
grindstone and crack the books.

At first it was thought that the
reason midnight oil was bclng
burned so late at cal-nay asylum
was to throw light on jam or
bull sessions. But, as the song
goes, 'Now It Can Be Told."

Thc midnight oil has been
burned to light the fire of knowl»
edge in the brains of the inmates.

If all thls is true, and the ofr

good grades were prominent
around here long before the
plague of insects, known as jitter-
bugs, invaded and cursed our

once peacefull campus,
There were happy (lays when

Carney was not an asylum, but a
place where men lived!

The 15 copies of Zephyr which
circulate throughout the United

You folks shouldn't expect the
Zephyr to be witty, It merely
serves as a judge of midwestern
wit.

something funny about the Zephyr

Wednesday 7 Francis W.

Thursday—Carol singing by
Pioneer chorus.

Fridayistudent chapel,

we said what we really want to
about them, we’d be banned from
the campus, To us, jitterbugs are
just another form of insects.

We got a BIG kick out of the
“witty” story by “Nance," espe-
cially since we turned it down,
along thh lts predecessor in the
other issue of Zephyr as possible
features for the Essenbee. Note
Zephilf you want more from
"Nance,” consult our waste beskr
ct.

We are announcing a. new contest,
open only to members of the
Zephyr staff. Doric will pay $100
for any NEW ldeas suhmlttcal by
the contestants. We haven‘t got
the money, but we feel safe, be.
cause Zeph’s Overlords haven't
any ideas.
