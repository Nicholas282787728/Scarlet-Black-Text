Butler Bulldogs, Creighton Bluejays
May Decide Valley Title This Week

Undefeated Fives Will Mix
in Indianapolis Saturday
for Loop Leadership

(Special 10 The srorlci mill Blot-t)

OMAHA, Nebl‘.-The inside lane
in the race for the Missouri valley
conference basketball title will be at
stake Saturday night, when the But-
ler university Bulldogs, defending
champions of the conference, tangle
in Indianapolis with the Creighton
university Bluejays from Omaha,
challengers to the title, in the first
game of a home-and-hoine series.

In last seasoirs th lling race the
two teams split a twogame series,
but Creighton was prevented from
sharing the title by a previous upset
by Drake, leaving Butler an undisput-
ed claim to the championship.

Creighton Stock dumps

This year only Butler and Cleigh-
ton remain undefeated in the confer-
ence. The Bulldogs took measure of
Washington university, generally can-
ceded to be the third strongest team
in the loop, and Creighton trounced,
Drake and Giiiinell, while the Oklas
homa Aggies have lost to Drake and
Washington.

Creighton stock, rated at less than
par at the opening of the season, took
a decided jump by virtue of six
straight victories rung up by the
Bluejays' ”sophomore team” this sea-
son, for which Emil “Box” Engel-
son and Jack Lomax, sophomore tors
wards, were largely responsible. But-
ler, on the other hand, rated in early
season dope as by far the strongest
member of the league, suffered a loss
of prestige by losing four of its eight
games already played.

Schrnidt-Deminary Duel

The Indianapolis encounter is like—l
ly to provide two splendid man-to-
man exhibitions. Willard Schmidt
Creighton-s Moot 8-inch all-confer
ence center, will oppose Gene Dem-
mary, Butler's star pivot man who
stands only onehalf inch shorter, and
Engelhretson, who supplies the pow-
er in the Jays' offense, will probab-
ly be paired against Frank Baird,
Butler’s spirited guard ‘

Coach A. A. Schabinger will prob
ably nominate for his starting lineup
the same combination that has been
so successful in downing all competi-
tion to date. This quintet lists Engels

 

bretson and Loinax at forward.
Schmidt at center, and Bob Miller
and Lester Kookroiv at guard.

For Butler Coach Tony Hingle will
probably start Bert Davis and Frank
Bei‘ssner at forward, Dcmmary at
center, and Baird and Roscoe Batts
at guard. Both teams rank about
equal in height and speed, with But-
ler holding the advantage in experi-
encc, as all of the starters are yet
erans.

Creighton Offense Forges
Ahead in Second Half
to Win 37-20

After leading during a large part
of the opening half and trailing by'
only three points at the rest period,
the Crinnell quintet wilted before
the Creighton offensive in the last
period Saturday, dropping the cons
test by a 37-20 count.

We buy only the center leaves fol-Luckies.
Not the top leaves for they are under—devel-
oped. Not the bottom leaves for they are
inferior in quality. Only the center leaves
for these are truly mild and fully ripe. And
that's the ﬁne tobacco we use—to make
Luckies so round, so ﬁrm, so fully packed
—free from loose ends that spill out. That’s
why Luckies are always mild, always truly
mild. And remember, ”It’s toasted”—
for throat protection—for finer taste.
