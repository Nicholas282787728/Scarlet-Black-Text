Novelties Feature Program

Given Friday Night
by Faculty Artist

By H, W. MATLACK

Few occasions are more stimulating
than an evening oi tine piano music
wcll played. Herrick Chapel offered an
opportunity oi this kind last night
when Sarah Inness MacDonald, of the
faculty, gave a program which hr
the rich variety of its Content and the
musicianship with which it was per
ior-med deserves a high place among
the musical cvean of this or any
other season. But seeing so many
seats unoccupied. and sorrowfully re.
counting the hundreds of students and
citizens. and perhaps members oi our
faculty, who were submitting to cubic
yards oi tonal garbage poured out oi
loud speakers here and there, the
pride which we might have in the
superior taste and intelligence of our
communin is rudely quenched.

Eur myseli, 1 consider it a privilege
to be in the same town. and in the
same college and same field of activity
as so Capable a musician as Miss Mac-
Donald proved herself to be last
night. When she has played before
I have been Conscious of a certain den
gree oi seli.imposed dynamic and
rhythmic restraint; last night she shook
this oli as the program moved irom
number to number, and lay the Lime
she was halfrway through it, her
playing was exuberant and stirring.

Chopin Sckclions Open Fromm

In the three Chopin selections which
opened the program, those dirges
which the composer was always pro»
nouneing over the vanished splendor
of Poland, now and then turning into
visions of a glorius luture when an—
other Jan Sohieski should arise to
lead the Polish hoisemen- to victory,

er to the passionate iury which al.
ways seized Chopin when he began
to dream oi his home land.

In later numbers on the program,
whatever their character, her play-
ing took on a ireedo'm and intimacy
of expression that revealed the de-
velopment oi a dauntless and aspiring
personality.’ -- "i
" Novelties Feahued

Many novelties were brought to us
in this program, The 'high spot in
romantic expression was undoubtedly
reached in Miss MacDonald’s tender
interpretation oi Scriabine’s ”Poem."
Her skill in iantastic interpretation
was splendidly maniie‘st in Medtner's
“Fairy Tale,” a modern ' pianistic
treatment oi the age—old “Who’s
Maid of the Big Bad Wolf?" The
group oi exotic pieces on Chinese
themes by Niemann aroused the un.
bounded enthusiasm oi her listeners.
and rightly so, and she responded
with another irom the same set, Call»
ed “Chinese Marionettes." it is im-
possible to say what a Chinese phil.
osopher would say oi these piano
pieces, but to me they were exciting
to the highest degree.

Welcome Features

The Beethoven sonata op, 110 and
the three pieces by Debussy were
most welcome ieatures oi the program.
This sonata, smoothly ﬂowing andtene
derly reflective. shows little evidence
of the stormy times that were falling

 

 

A Letter to the

Grinnell Cleaners

Dear Friends:

I’m sending a iur iacket this time which I can
.hardly part with at this time of the year. Ihope this
will come out specially well, not just because it is
squirrel and iragile, but because I’m specially iond

of this jacket.

Because it is sort of thick and malty like that old
beaver I used to have I always worry about moths so

any sort of extra thing
I shall appreciate.

you can do to war on them

I always sort of take pride,—when the subject
arises,~of telling my iriends that I have my iur
cleaned by the dry cleaners in spite of recommenda-

tions of furriers, and they

Please send me a bill
money and send it to you.

always turn out beautiful-
and I Shall scrape up the

to his last sonata.

Debussy and um stood side by
side on Miss MacDonald’s program, to
the disadvantage, it must be admitted,
oi Liszt. Debussy's excursions into
the lourth dimension oi the diatonic
scale have actually become popular,
while Liszt’s tooesweet sentimentali.
ties. even when almched to the sons
neb of Petrarch, do not seem to be
standing the test oi time. Liszt’s vora.
cious imagination turned everything
that came his way into a tone-poem,
irom "God Save the Queen” to the
philosophic proiundity oi “Les Pre.
ludes.” In so great a volume oi
music there is bound to bc a great
contrast in quality, The Liszt pieces
were redeemed however by Miss Mac—
Donald’s iinc sense oi values and
clear intelligent periormance.
