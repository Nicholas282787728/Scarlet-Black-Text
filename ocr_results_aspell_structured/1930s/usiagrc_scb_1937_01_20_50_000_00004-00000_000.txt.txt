A DEFINITION OF FASCISM

(Editor’s note: This is the second in a series
of three editon‘als discussing Fascism, Communism
and socialism. The material 101' this article is
gained from a discussion published a short while
ago in The christian Science Monitor.)

is s :<

The world was Ilrst aware of Fascism in
1922 when Benito Mussolini marched into
Rollie and proclaimed himself the dictator
of Italy.

What were the causes, the background,
which led to the establishment of a Fascist
dictatorship? After the World War, Ital—
ian politicians committed many outrageous
acts against the middle classes. The
country was in a state of chaos and unrest
It was at that time that the Fascists began
their work. They became the defenders of
the middle class, and they sought to over—
throw the radical politicians who controlled
the government. In 1922, as we have seen,
the Fascists came into power

The Christian Science Monitor has dev-
fined Fascism as "a political device for
maintaining as much of the ‘Status quo’ as
possible against the revolt of the masses.”
In maintaining the status quo, the govern-
ment has used force and suppression. There
is only one political party, the Fascist; there
is no real parliment; there is no economic,
social, cultural or political freedom.

Under a Fascist regime, the state is all—
powelful. Every person, every group,
every class must place the state above
everything else. It is supreme.

It is assumed in the United States that
Fascism is capitalism on the defensive
Nol in Thomas, the prominent American
socialist, explains that “Communism repre-
sents to business ‘a death sentence.’ Foss
cism, a. sentence, but a less severe one "
At any rate, Fascism enforces great sacri-
fices upon the labor class and the radical
gn'oups. In this, we might conclude that it
is reactionary.

In Germany, we find that Fascism is
known as National Socialism which is ex—
actly the some but with an anti—Semitism
and an anti-church feeling added.

Fascism or National Socialism. Both
represent government by one person. Be—
cause it is a one man party, it is hard, in-
deed to foresee the future of such a system
elf a one man rule can be called a system

Fascism is then, as we have seen, a one

 

man rule which holds the state up as the
one great loyalty and which oppresses the
lower classes ili favor of the upper classes.

ALL DESTRUCTION IS ‘FOR SPAIN‘
(Daily Trojan)

One of the tencis of the Fascist doctrine most
insistently dwelt upon by such leaders of the faith
as Herr Hitler and General Franco is that their
party aims to revitalize the national spirit and
to promote and to protect the nation‘s culture.

Without discussing the merits of his objec—
tives let us allow to the fuehrer that he has done
very nicely on point one. There is a patriotic
spirit of a sort in Germany today. How much 01
it is synthetically created by the Nazi portymen
is difficult to determineibut thc fervo, irrespec-
tive of its source and depth of sincerity, is theic.

Herr Hitler's incipient Spanish associate in
Fascism, Senor Franco, is also reported to have
great ability in arousing patriotic zeal. Unfor-
stcly it is now much wasted. Hitler, when he
speaks gloriously of Germany and the greatness
to come, may, at least, address himself to Gerr
mans. But General Franco's audience is confined
to his army whose membership is distressingly
short on real, honcst-togoodness Spaniards.

The peculiarity of his position has not kept
General Franco from reiterating time and again
in the past few months that all he is doing is ”for
Spain." It has doubtless been a source of much
sadness to him that he has had to ravage almost
the whole of his homeland and wage war on nearly
all Spaniards to achieve what he Wants ”for
Spain.” But he has been brave about this. The
losses and sufferings of the moment are forgotten
in the mystical contemplation of the greater Spain
that the general will someday leadﬁlf there is
any Spain left.

On the matter of preservation of the identity
of the national culture, the record has been none
too good in the past two weeks.

A. nation‘s art, as it is treasured and kept
alive and growing in the theaters, in the galleries.
in the museums, in the concert halls, in ,the
schools, is a most important part of its culture.

With something akin to the horror of the
world upon learning in September, 1914. of the
bombing of the cathedral at Rheims, we read 3‘
few days ago that the generars airplanes were
dropping explosives in the district about the Pra-
da, Maui-id's celebrated national museum and art
gallery.

Here are housed the great treasures of Spain
which have been collected sincc the 13th century.
They include the gifts of royal patrons since the
time of Charles v. Herc will be found master-
pi cc: of both Elem .h and Italian art. But most
important of all is the famous Velazquez room
which has been the object of the pilgi-images of
thousands of art-lovers to Spain. In this room
are collected some of the finest paintings in the
histoiy of ai-t~and they are Spanish.

The general is destroying Madrid from the
air “for Spain." The Prsda may go any day.

If the general has as little concern for pres
serving Spain’s art as was indicated in the fate
of the famous El Greco altar piece at Toledo, it is
useless even to retain a vestige of hope for the
Prado. Should Madrid fall, Franco’s men, who
have few sympathies with the Spanish people, will
likely i-ansack and carry off what treasures they
can lay their hands on in public buildings.

But the general says it is all “for Spain."

“Five years ago youth in general talked much
about sophistication and skepticism. It liked the
posture. Today, there is less talk about it and no
posture of sophistication. The young men and women
now actually are intellectual skeptics, however, a
healthier and more wholesome type. It is the ques-
tioning approach of persons sincerely groping for
belief in something to which they can tie, and which
their intelligence can accept.”

Carrying on a campaign which he began as an
undergraduate student 21 years ago, Robert E.
Stone, assistant professor of law at the University
of California, allows the use of typewriters in his
mid-term examinations.

Professor Stone believes that better papers are
often produced because of the use of a typewriter.
Mind processes are transmitted to paper by thc ma,
chine at a more nearly normal speed.

However, only five per cent of his pupils use
them.

What is your time worth?

Dr. William Otis Hotchkiss told members of the
entrance class at chssclacr Poly in Troy. N. x,
that including the cost of their tuition, loss of labor,
contributions through the college and other items,
their time in college was costing them about $1.50
an hour.

Comments
of the Readers

To the Editor of the Scarlc't and

Black:

You and your Editorial board
are to be complimented for the
editorial which appeared in the
Scarlet and Black last Wednesday
entitled, "A Chance for Student
Action."

As a member of the band as Well
as a major in music, I should like
to point out a few reasons in ad—
dition to the one of serving the
school; why those who have any
ability at all on band instruments
should play in the band.

In the first place, a school with
as fine a music conservatory and
music faculty as Gn'nnell college
possesses should be ashamed to be
content With a small band, espe-
cially when surrounding rows col-
leges are able to produce much
larger hands. This is entirely
the fault and responslbility of the
Students, and can in no way be
blamed upon the music depart-
ment or administration.

In the second place, band mem-
bers do not play entirely without
recognition. A band member is
awarded a sweater with a Grin-
hell college music emblem for four
semesters service in the band.
Furthermore, band members re—
ceive full semester’s physical edu-
cation credit for each Semester in
the hand. There are other small
advantages too, such as favored
seats at athletic contests. So a
band member’s service is not ex)-
tirely forgotten.

But there is another real bene-
fit which can be derived from
playing in the band. The student.
who owns an instrument but who
does not play it during the four
years he is iii college, gets too far
away from the ability to play
that instrument, and once out of
college, the chances are that he
will greatly regret the neglect of
his music, How often have you
heard an adult say, “I’d surely
give a lot to be able to play a
musical instrument—I used to
play a little but I got away from
it, and now I'm sorry I did?" I've
heard that quite often from agreat
many different people.

And so I again commend your
editoilsl, and hope you will con»
tinue to demand that this school
he represented by a band of which
we may be duly proud.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Weidauer.
