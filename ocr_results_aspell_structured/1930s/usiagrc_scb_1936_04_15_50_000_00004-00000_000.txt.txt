AN APPRECIATION.

With this issue of the Scarlet and Black,
Henry Hirsch, present business manager, will
conclude his work. At this time we think
that it is only fitting to stop and consider
What his association has meant to the paper.

He stepped into the position of business
manager at as unfavorable time as could be
imagined, following two other business man-
agers, and without previous experience here,
Circulation was badly mixed up, and the
books of the paper seemed hopeless Never-
theless he undertook the task alid succeeded
Now the business end of the paper is again
re-organized and to a degree which it never
has been in the last few years.

And this result has been the work of one
man, It is with a feeling of regret that we
acknowledge the inevitable as he prepares to
leave office, but nevertheless the work that
he has done will be long remembered. Per-
haps, the best that we can say is ”stout fel-
lah,” good luck.

WHY CLASS OFFICERS?

From Iowa State college comes the news
that two of the four offices in each class have
been abolished. The positions of v‘ice—presi—
dent, secretary and treasurer were done
away with, and a secretary-treasurer posi-
tion was created to replace the three offices.
Thus instead of electing four officials each
class will elect only a president and a secrec
tary-trcasurer.

The reasons given for this action were:
“Cutting the number of class offices to two
would eliminate useless class offices, in fact,
would get rid of offices which were often
detrimental."

The student government organizations at
Iowa State are making a forward step in
taking this action and undoubtedly, it will be
followed at other schools. Grinnell should be
included in this group.

Class offices on the campus here have little
or no justification from the standpoint of
work done, and the honor is a hollow one, be-
cause of the low ebb of class spirit. When
no more than a dozen people show enough in-
terest to be present at a class election the of-
ficers so named do not represent the class.
Therefore, the class offices cannot be justi-
fied from the standpoint of an additional op
portunity to shower honors upon deserving
shoulders.

Looking at the situation from the stand,
point of service performed, none of the class

officers do a great deal and the Vicerpl‘esl-
dent and the secretary do absolutely nothing.
The duties that are performed could be hand-
led much more efficiently by others. There-
fore, why not abolish at least two of the four
class offices, and perhaps even the entire set-
U 3,

A MATTER OF ET’IQUETTE

It has not been the policy of the Scarlet
and Black to attempt to dictate etiquette to
Grinnell students or to tell them how to be-
have at social gatherings, but several things
which occurred at the varsity last Saturday
night certainly merit attention.

The chaperoils who attend the dances, usu»
ally dormitory house mothers, deserve respect
and courteous treatment from all of the stu-
dents who attend the dances. The minimum
amount of etiquette would require that a per
son greet the chapel-ans, At the last varsity,
very few of those students attending paused

,to greet them.

Another matter was complained of which
made the dance unpleasant for some persons
For p001" dancers to run into other couples on
the floor might be excusable, but when good
dancers make such errors and make them
continually, no excuse can be offered. It
not only shows poor taste, but a definite lack
of knowledge of the rules of etiquette as well.
No one can enjoy dancing when other couples
are continually bumping into him and his
partner, No one can forgive such action
when it is done thoughtlessly, and sometimes
intentionally.

To make Grinnell varsities better, be more
considerate—of the chaperons and of the
other fellow.

Other Opinions

VFW, A POLITICAL FORCE
(Syracuse Daily Sun)

. . The proponents of the Veterans of Future

Wars are probably communists or at least par-

lor bolsheviks besides being unpstriotic by their

action. These collegiate boys and girls won't
have to go to warmthey’rc too yellow. They
should be classed in the same group that com-
prised the Draft Dodgers’ League during the

Great War.”AA U, s. senator.

That the statement is ridiculous is self-evident.
That the present administration is not a little afraid
of the subtle form of ‘ridicule of the “future graft-
ers” movement is almost as apparent.

In the movement itself is the evident fact that
thinking student leaders are tired of the graft. and
foul play that come from the Congressional perk-
barrel. Organizations paralleling the “Future Wars”
grcup, such as the “Future Grafters," the "Future
Gold Diggers," and even the “Future Chaplains of
Future Wars," bears this out. These groups Show
that thinking students don’t trust government to
keep us out of Ftuurc Wars. Can they be called
yellow for wanting to keep away from certain
death?

It might not be wise on the part of government
leaders, Republican er Democrat, to ignore the net»
ional student body. Students may sway public cp-
inion with the glittering appeal of their novel ac-
tions, so that government may have another power-
ful force with which to reckon.

A DISTORTED PICTURE
(Iowa state Student)

In screaming headlines we read, “Plane hits Moun-
tain; 11 die."

Yes, a plane crash killing almost a dozen persons
is a terrible thing~a tragic, sickening catastrophe.
Yet every day planes roar over our heads from point
to point and no mishap occurs. No one ever screams
cut the comparative safety of airplanes. It is the
unusual that makes the headlines, not the common-
place.

Few there are who make big news of an automo-
bile accident. No, they are far too common for
news. Yet the percentage of fatalities due to auto-
mobiles is proportionately greater than those fatali—
ties due to airplanes. The picture seems to us to be
a bit distorted. We wonder why the emphasis isn't
placed upon what is more significant and closer to
home. Of course, news cf a mere automobile crash
wouldn't make headlines, but displaying prominently
the casualties of something less important, seems to

be putting the emphasis other than where it should
be.
