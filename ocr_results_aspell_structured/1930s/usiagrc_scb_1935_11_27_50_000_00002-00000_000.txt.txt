MORALE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

\Vell, we are still at the crossroads. Athe
letically we are getting nowhere fast, and al
though we probably gained a moral victory Sate
urday, still it is hard to thrive on such things,
and to the world at large they mean nothing.

in Saturday’s issue of the Scarlet and
Black was printed an open letter to the editor
charging that one factor had been overlooked
when the demand for an athletic shake-up was
made last Wednesday. The letter charged that
members of the varsity football tealn had been
hiding behind the football coaches. and that
the players had refused to take the blame for
their indifferent attitude and playing.

\Ve can not vouch for the accuracy of this
assertion, although since the letter was written
by two members of the varsity loam, the
charges soem reasonable. However, does that
alter the situation in the least?

We have been losing games. Whyl Pei-—
haps because of the combination of reasons
already suggested—a need for a shakcup in the
athletic department and the indifferent atti-
tude on the part of the team members. If so
then the problem is how to cure this situation.

We believe that this nestled improvement
in the nrrlralr of the team can be best achieved
by a 'adical shakeup ill the Grillnell athletic
department. Part of this lack of spirit must
be the result of the manner ill which this do-
partluout has been handling its men, and if this
cause is removed it seems only reasonable to be
liere that the morale of the “team will improve
to a marked degree. The constant grumbling
which has been quite prevalent among team
mombo at least until the fact was made pull-
l' last \\ edncsday, seems to bear out this be

. lso it seems only logical to believe that
if a winning team is developed. or ‘lhcrc begins
to appear to he prospects of success. that a new
spirit will be born. \Vitllcss the early days of
the past football season, when the squad and
the campus ill general u re talking in terms
of a Successful football season, thnt llzipe
pcntrl’7 The, team lmmlu losing and with rnrlh
defeat the mornlr‘ of the campus midi' 'eclus
only natural ‘10 believe—of the squad steadily
sank.

’l‘hus it seems rather obvious that a radical
change in the athletic department would create
a more wholesome atmosphere and that the very
idea of a new deal would certainly do lunch
to eliminate the low morale which has been
present on the football squad and the campus
in ani’l'fll, Until the lllOl‘r’llC is raised to fl
mulch higher level, their is no use of hoping
that Grillllcll will be able to regain a place as

may be had.

Readers Opinions—-

Dear Editor:

1 have been following your editorials in the
Scarlet and Black with a great deal of interest.
Being one of the many persons on this campus
who are interested in our football teams, I wish
to congratulate you on your fine stand in this mat-
ter.

I believe that a college football team is one of
the biggest assets a school can have for getting pub.
licity. If any school has a poor athletic showing
for any considerable period of time, it is going to
reﬂect on the school and picture it in the minds of
outsiders as a “dub School,” Therefore, I am in
complete agreement with you when you say that
Grinnell is at the crossroads in regard to its athletic
policies. Grinnell most either make athletics mean
something or abandon them entirely as far as inter-
collegiate competition is cohcerned I would rather
be from a school that has taken a sensible attitude
and abandoned competitive athletics, than to be
from one which allowed its teams to continue to be
the recipients of humiliating defeat. After all one
takes pride in his alma mater. and few can take
pride in continuous defeat.

I was somewhat surprised when I ran across
the declaration in an open letter in last issue that
men did not like to block and tackle hard, and that
when men did not like to do this. no amount of
blocking and tackling practice could make them like
it. To me this is nothing more than an admittance
that most of the men on the squad were there in
order to live up to a reputation and wanted to do so
by doing just as little as possible. If that is the
case, I can only shake my head and feel sorry for
the team, and wonder why the new men even bother
to go out for football. After all, the game is not
a tea party, and if it is to be played right the play-
ers will have to work hard, learn the fundamentals
and execute them to the best of their ability. If
we are going to continue to have men who go after
the game half heartedly, then I say abandon the
game entirely.

Therefore, as I see the situation. the difficulty
comes from three directions. First, the indifference
that the administration displays in desiring Grin-
nell to be on top athletically. Secondly, the mode
quacy of the coaching staff in being able to know
and handle their men properly; and thirdly, the
apparent lack of real interest in'thc game by the
players themselves. It Grinnell is to come out on
top, the administration is going to have to change
its attitude, the athletic department is going to have
to revise their theories and methods of coaching
football, and the players are going to have to realize
that they are going out to play football and not just
to uphold reputations.

Let me again congratulate you, Mr. Hunn, for
your genuine interest in this situation, and 1 sin-
cerely hope that a satisfactory and beneficial result

We've just been looking through
the last issue of the monthly dish
rag. The cover was pretty, so we
went through the things back-

saving the best for the last. Ima-
gine our surprise when the first
thing we saw was that the rag

Naturally we wanted to inves-
tigate this unprecedented isitnae

‘We‘al‘s’o‘discovcred that we print

So that's that. By Christmas

report for the practices. callaway

ling from professional matches,
but that the danger of injury in
amateur wrestling was very slight.

“Undoubtedly we will be handl-
capped this year through lack of
experience," callaway stated, “but
there is no reason why Grinnell
cannot develop a wrestling team
which will in a year or two be able
to compete on even terms with
schools of similar size in Iowa.
