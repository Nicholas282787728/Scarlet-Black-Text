A second half rally that was good
for 15 points served to put Grinneli
into undisputed second place in the
Missouri Valley conference race last
night with a 2&23 victory over the
Oklahoma Aggies. The contest shoved?
coach "Puny" James' Cowboys fuiu

comeback of “Hank" Duncan. south—i

ward for GTinneil, and the flashy
work of Joey Ley. sturdy tow~headi
with the visiting aggregation.

Duncan starts

Duncan started the scoring when
he took the first tipoff for a long-
shot, but Hensley, Collins, and Ley‘
followed in rapid order to put the Ag-
gies in the lead. Duncan and Ley both
scored from the floor and Rowe’s
tip—in snot combined with McCreary's
charity toss to put the count at s
to 7. Highfill and Loy counted beforel
the half ended, however, and Rowe’s‘
shot. which was on the hoop as the
gun sounded made the halftime score,
12 to 9 for the southerners. l

Ley opened the second half with‘
a basket which gave the Aggies a
14-9 lead but McCreary started Grim
Dell’s rally with a free throw. He
dribbled in for a goal a moment later
and Duncan followed this with two
rapid-fire shots to give the Pioneers
a 16 to I4 advantage.

Tie Score

The visitors tied the count at 16~
all and iii-all. but there was no stop
ping the scarlet and black outfit as
Duncan, Ullrich, and Frye hit the
hoop in turn.

Coach John C. Trucsdale ran his re-
se‘rve men in for the final minutes
of play, but the Cowboys coulrl only
score three points before the game
ended,

Clean dome

Duncan and Ley tied for scoring
honors, each getting credit for 12
personals being called, and no one

Committee Heads Declare

Time Insufficient

Building and cottage chairmen for
the 1932 Pioneer Prudities decided
at a joint meeting with the general
committee held in the Alumni Recita—
tion hall yesterday afternoon to defin-
itely abandon the Prudities for this
year, The rcvue was to he held in the
high school auditorium, Feb, 27.

Reasons for the Committee's decis-
ion were that the datc did not give
suff'cient time for the proper re-
wi- ng and rehearsals of the individ.
iial acts, and as the college and high
school schedules were such that a
later date this spring was unobtain-
able. it was thought unwise to ob
tempt to present them in their poorly
finished state.

Of the six manuscripts handed in
to the general committee for its ap-
proval only two were deemed good
enough for presentation, and those
required minor changes. Another rea-
son for the abondonment was the
lack of interest which some of the
