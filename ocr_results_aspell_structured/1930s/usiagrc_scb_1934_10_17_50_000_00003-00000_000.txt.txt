Music Critic Praises Interpretations
by Smiley in Piano Recitai Friday

Artist Shows Real Aptitude
in Presentation of 18th,
19th Century Music

By II. “I. MATLACK

In contrast with many artists whose
careers began before the world war,
Bertha Shutts Smiley, for several
years a member of our faculty before
she followed her husband to Carleton
college—a double loss for Grinnell—~
has let herself become neither be-
wildered or oppressed by the new deal
in music. On the contrary she has
made herself at home with the new
cults in rhythm and dissonance, with—
out in the least forsaking hcr re-
markable aptitude for the music of a
century earlier. Moreover she in—
fuses everything she plztys, old or
new, with warm intelligence; the tendc
emess with which She clothesquieter
passages is profoundly moving,

Based on African Jalz

But serenity is onlyhalf of it. In the
Spanish pieces by Albeniz and Ravel
she grasped their prickly dissonanccs
and tangled Moorish rhythms with
bold and unflinching hands. Based
on drums, bagpipes, and guitars, Span—
ish music traces its descent back to the
barbaric origins of African jazz, with
this notable distinction. that while the
Moorish went through a civilized
evolution in Spain, in Africa it re~
niained primitive.

Morning Serenade

The delicate “Evocaticn” from Al-
benizY “Iberia," a true arabesque if
ever there was one, is one aspect of
Spanish music; the harsh and violeni
dances called “El Purto” and “Alboh
ado" revealed another. All alborado
is, to commit an Irish bull if not a
Spanish one, a serenade played in the
morning, like Schubelt’s“Hark, Hark,
the Lark.” Its purpose is not to lull
the fair one to rest, but to waken her
to sweet music. Apparently the Span—
ish Cavaliers were not so gentle about
it, or else their fair ones were so deep—
ly immured in heavy citadels that it
took the racket of an invading anny
to penetrate their retreats. But in any
event it is exhilarating music, and in
it Mrs. Smiley was most brilliantly ef-
fective.

Musical Curiosity

Her first ninnber,-aach's capriccio
on the departure of his brother for a
new job, is likey lto be heard more in
the next few months than in the past
hundred years, in View of the Bach
celebration early in 1935 marking the

sessions but who wish to continue
their higher education.

Art students of the Chicago An
institute will be awarded bachelor of
fine arts and bachelor of dramatic arts
degrees, through arrangements just
completed with University of Chicago
authorities. This will be the first year
that the Institute has awarded these
degrees.

Up to 1858, college charges for stu-
‘dents at the University of Alabama
were $52 per year, and included
tuition, room rent, library rent, sera
vant hire and fuel. The student had
to supply his bed and other furniture
for his room.

250 anniversary of his birth. Each was
15} years old when he wrote this
capriccic. It is one of the curiosities
of the 18th centuryﬁallnost 17m cen»
tury music. Did Bach write it for iun,
or was he in earnest about the terrors
of the journey—less than a hundred
miles, which his brother was about
to take? The clue seelns to me to lie
in the little march where his il'ionds
bid him godspeed; it is jolly and [Cs—
tive, and the fact that there is no
weeping after the coach has disap»
peered at the dizzy spccd of seven
miles an hour, while the postilion
plays a merry fanfare that turns into
a fugue in the most classical 17th cen»
,tury manner, makes it impossible to be
any more serious about this caprlcc
than Each was himsell. It was thor—
oughly delightful, and in it Mrs.
Smiley revealed a little known type
of music of the period.
Qunrtct Found Wanting

The final selection on the program,
Brahms’ imposing quartet in A major
for piano and strings, seemed to lack
brilliantly after the Spanish music,
perhaps because thc tone of the plane
was Veiled by the closcd lid. The line
usual length of the quartet, espccially
in its position at the end of the pro—
gram, was against its complete ef—
fectiveness. No lover of Brahms will
ever admit that he wrotc anything
dull. If this composition scented dull
in occasional spots it must have been
the listener’s fault, and not the fault
of the players who devoted themselvt‘
to its performance with enthusiasm
and vigor. '

Speaker Explains
Crisis in Orient

(Continued From Page 1)

Japanese intervention in Manchuria,
however, would not have occurcd had
it not been for the rise to power of the
“new” military party, as the lecturer
termed it, in Japan, This was caused
by the failure of thc domestic policy
of the parliinentory party and the fact
that the depression was hearing more
and morc heavily upon the rural
classes of Japan.

Thus the conditions for seizure of
Manchuria wore ripe both within and
without Japan, and thc military
party soon took advantage of the op—
portunity.

“Japan from a stragetic and mili—
tary standpoint has a iustiliable claim
in regard to Manchuria, but the much
publicized economic factors have been
entirely overcmphasized." Whyte said
in summarizing the Japanese case.

In concluding his address, while
stated that the responsibility for the
present crisis depends upon thrce fac—
tors. First, the chaotic conditions in
China which prevented thc establish—
ment of a stable government. Second,
the Japanese intemperate and grasp—
ing use of the Chinese situation,
Third, the fact that the United States
and Great Britain did not realize the

 

importance of their obligations in the
Orient until too latc to prevent the
present crisis.
