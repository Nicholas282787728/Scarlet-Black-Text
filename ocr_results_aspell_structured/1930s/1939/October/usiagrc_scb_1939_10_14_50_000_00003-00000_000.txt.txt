2-Day Program

The 20th annlml Iowa Hish
School Press association couve »
tion hcgan yesterday with the
registering of 240 delegates {ram
30 schools.

The association was formed in
1919 with Gi-iniiell as host school.
The State University of Iowa,
Iowa state college and Drake
university came into thc associa~
tion in 1931, and thereafter each
school sponsored the convention
every fourth year.

Ryan Speaks.

“Challenge conventions with
initiative and originality," was
the advice of Prof. John P. Ryan
to assembled members of the
I. H. S. P, A. in the first meet-
ing of the conclave held in the
auditorium of the Alumni Recita—
tion hall yesterday afternoon.

Those planning to enter jour-
nalism should promptly make up
their minds conceming what spe~
clfic phase they wish to enter.
Ryan continued. As soon as they
have made this decision, they
should learn the relationship of
that phase to the whole field.
Newspaper Function Told.

“Newspapers of today must do
more than gather and dissemie
nate news," Ryan declared. “The
fact has grown increasingly
clear that it is the duty of the
newspapers to interpret news to
‘meet the need for better reader
understanding."

In conclusion, Ryan quoted
William Allen White’s plea for
freedom of the press: “Reason
never failed men: force and re-
pression made the failures of the
world.”

Yates Speaks.

Following the convention din!
nor in the quadrangle dining
room. Georgc Yates, chief pllur
tographcr of the Des Moincs
Register and Trihune, delivered
an address to the delegates in
the Little Theatre of the quad
ranglc on "The Romance of
Camera Journalism."

“Photographers must have rc~
soiirccfulness and strike out for
themselves," Yates told the cons
clave. “Always make your pic—
tures a little better than the
other fellow's."

Explains Photography.

In explaining modern photo—
graphy, Yates said that there
was no limit to the distance you
can photograph when using lnfl'zlr
rcd rays. He also stated that
while a photographer's life may
he exciting he can not be carried
away by the moment.

“We have ethics in our busi»
nsss,”YateS continued, “butusualr
ly make them up as we go
along. You can't stay in newspa;
per work if you break faith."
Photographers Have class.

uPhotographers today have
more class than they had 25
years ago," Yates declared,
“Twenty-five years ago theywerc
of the roughneck type.”

The conolave ended this noon
with the regular business meet»
ing of the association and the
presentation of awards.
