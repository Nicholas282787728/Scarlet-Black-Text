A SANE HELL WEEK

This is a letter of praise for the Men’s
Council, the Men’s Houses, and their “Hell
Week” committees for their conduct of the
best-spirited, most enthusias c, and most
sancly conducted “Hell Week" I have
’hnown at Grinncll. So far as I know,
everyone feels that there was no brutality,
little if any malicious mistreatment or un-
fair advantages taken of freshmen, and no
objectionable stunts. Freshmen and upper-
classmen alike have been saying that this
“Hell Week” very nearly made no enemies
among the men, but, on the contrary, dc-
vcloped many personal and house friend—
ships among the men of all halls, Surely
Grinnell has never heal better or jollicr
flOM‘SllU’lUS since the passing of the Pioneer
Prudities. The chairmen in charge of stunts
showed more healthy and normal imagination
in planning costumes and stunts than I have
seen demonstrated here in a long time I
know that the faculty appreciates the fact
that the men did not plan or permit any
interference with classes or any other aca-
demic activities on Friday (“Hell Week" of
ficially began at tile end of the class day).
I hear that the Quadrangle women were
pleased that the men inaugurated a new
custom by confining their stunts and pro-
grams to the men’s and the central campus
and to the town streets. The citizens appre-
ciated the attitude of the"mcn and their
officers in not molesting them or their pro-
pertyr \

The best rumor I have heard about the
Council’s action in settling their final plans
for "Hell Weeh” last Thursday evening
when I was purposely-absent is this: that
they thought of drawing up a complete state-
ment of the policies they followed in making

this the best “Hell Week” the college has
known, with thc'purposc in mind that future
Councils may have that statement to begin
with in making further plans and improve»
ment If this idea is followed, possibly we
may all be spared the necessity of g g
through a very awkward and often [2 itat—
ing period of arguing, discussing, suggest
ing, agreeing, and disagreeing on what a
decent and justifiable “Hell Week” should
be. It is far more sensible to meet problems
of that sort in advance rather than to have
to deal with angry public opinion of stud-
ents, faculti, deans, trustees, and famil ,
as well as the general public and the town
of Grinnell when we violate our own stains
dards of good treatment, good sense, and
good taste. Praise again to the men for
the best “Hell WWW-end the freshmrh, the
halls, and even the deans have enjoyed at

THE COMING CONFERENCE

This Friday and Saturday the Gl‘ilmell cam-
pus will be the scene of the ninth annual
student conference on International Relav
tions. The six speakers who have been
selected to lead the conference all have im-
pressive records. They are men who have
travelled widely and who have a first hand
knowledge of foreign affail's, We can be
sure that their roles in the conference will
be well filled.

The success of this conference, made up
as it is of a large number of discussions, de-
pends in a great measure upon the partici—
pation of the audience. This means that if
the students who attend its meetings make
intelligent comments and ask plenty of
questions about any points which have not
been made clear, they are going to get a
great deal of value that they wollld other-
wise miss, The conference is made up of
discussions with this idea in mind.

This year, because of the war, our ab-
tention is centered especially on foreign
affairs. We want to know a great deal
about the nations that are already at war,
We want to know even more, perhaps, about
the nations that have not as yet lined up on
one side or the other, We want to know
about Germany‘s chances of winning the
war, about the effect of the war on the
British Empire, about that all-important
question mark, Russia. We want to know
what is likely to happen to the small neutral
states in Europe. We want to learn more
about totalitarianism and dictators and pro-
paganda. To get a better idea of the pres
sent state of world affairs, we must use
these speakers intelligently. We must listen
to them thoughtfully. We must weigh their
statements carefully We must try to or-
ganize and 'elate our knowledge, to con-
sider possibilities and probabilities, to form
an intelligent opinion of what our country’s
course should be in a world gone mad If
we who attend the meetings can do these
things, the conference will have been a suc—
0955.

In this spirit of discussion, of meeting
together to think our way through some of
the pressing problems of the world of today,
we extend the heal'tlest of welcomes to
speakers Lash, Page, Klotsche, Doman, Sal'-
gent, and Slnha. We’ll see you Friday and
Saturday at the Conference!

Churchill Seen
As Real Leader
In Britain Today

By William c. Harris.

Last year a grizzled old man
toting a fur-lea umbrella was the
idol of the British Empire. To-
day that idol is a round—faced,
round—fronted little chappie, go<
ing by the handle of Winston.
Admitted to the cabinet at
the beginning of the current

European 5 c r a p , Winston

Leonard Churchill has become
England’s man 0’ the hour. Al-
most by popular demmul this
cllerllbicrluoldng gentleman has
returned to the post he held
during thc first World \Vzlr,
First Lord of the Admiralty.
And current betting odds have
it that it won’t be long before
he ccccds Sir Neville as the
offi 'll guiding. bond of His
Majesty’s Government.

Already it is rumored that. the
First Lord is the real directing
genius in the British cabinetand
probably with plenty of reason,
for Mr. Churchill is famous for
his "powerful personality.” In
fact, there have been times. as
under the Baldwin and Bonar

Law ministries, when
personality has kept him out of
the cabinet; the ministers didn’t
care to place themselves in the
position of being overwhelmed by
the Churchill wit.

Throughout his sixty-five
years, “'iusmn has been more
or less of a character. At prep
school—Brighton (ml! Han-ow—
hc was something of a problem
for iris teachers; and, like most
important men, he didn’t do so
not in his examinations. It
wasn't until he reached Sliml-
liu , the British West Point,
thnt Churchill found something
in which he was intcrcstcrl and
went to town on fortiﬁcations,

topography, and tact ,
His reputation was really es-

tablished as a war correspondent
in the Cuban rebellion, where he
served as a volunteer with the
Spaniards, and in the Boer war,
in the latter fight. he was cap-
tured by the Dutchmen, and then
maria a rather sensational escape,
all of which made him something
of a darling to the wanwcary
Britishers.

Cashing in on this wave of
popularity, the young Churchill
got himself elected to porliar
ment, mus beginning a public
career which has lasted, with
only minor interruptions, until
the present—and hasn't stopped
yet, Soon elevated to the mine
istry and then the cabinet, he
made big news in 1911 when,
as Home Secretary, he sanc-
tioned nn nrtillery siege of a
bunch of criminals in a London
slui-n district
During the World War, it was
he who conceived the illrfated
Dsrclanellas campaign, which, if
it had been successful, would
have ended the war two years
sooner. The terrific loss of life,
plus the miserable failure of the
attempt, resulted in Winston’s
resignation.

Churchill has never bowed to
parties or to pe'rsmls, and isn‘t
likely to start now. That's why
we're 'lling to bet that the
cabinet is now bowing to him
off the record—and will soon
start doing it on the record.
