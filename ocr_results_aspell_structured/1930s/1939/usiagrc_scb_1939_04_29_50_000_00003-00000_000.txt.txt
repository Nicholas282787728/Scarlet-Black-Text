Quad Housing
Plan Will Be
Pu+ +0 Vo‘ie

Proposal Equalizes
Class Distribution
In Four Cottages

Women of the quadrangle will
vote Wednesday noon on a new
housing plan which is to be pre~
sented for discussion at house
meetings Monday night. The plan
has been worked out by a com—
mittee selected from members of
the new and old League Boards;
has received the approval of the
advisory board; and has been re~
commended by them to the con-
sideration of the whole quad—
rangle.

Equalize Distribution.

The purpose of the plan, ac-
cording to the committee, is to
equalize the distribution of Soph—
omores, juniors and seniors in
the four upper class cottages in
order to attain greater cottage
unity and cooperation and to
, broaden the range of interests and
acquaintances of individual resi-
dents.

Under the new plan a certain
number of rooms will be reserved
‘1" Cleveland, James, Haines and
Read for each of the three upper
classes, thus bringing about a
favorable balance of sophomores,
jtu-nors and seniors in each cots
tage. ,

Room Drawing unaffected.

The plan will not affect the sy-
stem of room drawmgs as it has
existed in previous years.

Because of the increase in reg—
istration tor next year, the quota
figures drawn up by the commit-
tee are subject to change.

Following is the distribution of
classes as it exists under the pre-
sent housing plan and as it would
exrt under the proposed plan.

Present distribution: Cleveland
