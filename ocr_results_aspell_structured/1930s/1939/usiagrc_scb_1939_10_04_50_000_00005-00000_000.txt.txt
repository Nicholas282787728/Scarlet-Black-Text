RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Thorn Kuhl.

The Carleton game was a tough
battle to lose. but it was more
discouraging to hear the remarks
dropped by the Carleton players
after the game,

r a

According to one player, “Grlnncll
lacked pep in the line. They out-
weighed us, but we didn’t feel the
extra weight." The lack of pep
might have been due to the fact
that Capt. Howard Grimes was
Suffering from an infection and
unable to play.

i .

"The whole team lacked snap.
Why, we thought Grinnell would
be tough and it turned out they
were easy,” was the way another
Carleton player explained it, If
the Pioneers expect to do as well
against Drake as they did last
year, they will have to show
more SNAP and PEP while
they're on the field,
.

s

. v

The Drake rivalry dates back to
1896. Since that time, Crinnell
has won 15 games, lost 29, and
two battles endedjn ties. The
last time the pioneers scored a
victory over the Bulldogs was in
1932 by a score of 7 to o.

s t .
One reason advanced for the fact
that several of the outstanding
passers in recent years, such as
Sammy Bhugh, Davey O’Brien,
Parker Hall, and Billy FattErson,
came from the south or southwest
is the fact that almost ideal
weather Conditions exist through-
out the season.
