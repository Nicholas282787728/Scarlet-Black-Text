Cage Coach
Is Pessimis’ric

Over Squad

Team 15 Weakest
Of Eight Years
Says Tl‘uesdale

By Neuman Fell.

“This squad to date is lcss other
tire than any other squad in the
last eight years in i spect to ear»
ly practice performance.” said
Coach John c. Truesdale of his
1939-40 Grinnell collegc basketball
squad,

“The reason," continued Tl‘nesz
dale, “is that we lost four letter--
men through graduation. Former
Capt. Robert Berry. Wilbur Luick,
John Turner, and Fred Luther
were last year's mainstays.”
Style of Play Changed.

A lack of height has caused a
modification of the typical Pioneer
style of play. Instead of the usual
high passing game, Grinnell has
installed the short, swift, ct‘isse
cross pass, As yet, however, the
Fioneel's have not achieved the
timing that is necessary tor that
type of basketball.

Truestlale hesitated in naming
any probablc regular five. How-
ever. three of last Season’s letters
meniCapt, James Nash, Eugene
Peisner, and Jerry For ill une
doubtedly be in the opening line-
up against Iowa state, Dec, 8.
Fort set a new sophomore scoring
record last year. and Nash's fine
floor play together with Peisn
passing aided the Pioneers in win-
ning more than one gamc,

Niederhauser

Plans Airfield

Pilot Able to Build
Field Here Meeting
Federal Standards

“We arc removing the airport obs
stacle."

This was the reply of Ray Gus-
tafson and Robert Hall whori
questioned as to the progress of
the Civil Pilot training program,
proposed for Crinnell next year.

Hall, who with Gustafson has
headed the aviation movement on
the campus, said that he has cure
responded with Glen Nicderhauser,
chief-pilot and owner of the Nle»
derhauser Airways of Marshalb
town, Iowa. who has suggested
constructing an airport hero.

Niederhauscr-s letter read in
part, “I am glad to see that c n-
nell is interested in the Civi an
PiloL Training program. and I
think that by next fan I will be
ahlc to establish an airport at
Crinnell which will meet all thc
government requirements.”

Hall further stated that he was
to meet Niedei-nauser Thursday to
arrange for a definite conference
with the college authorities. “The
yea or nay of the authorities will
then decide the fate of the Civil
pilot training at Gl‘innell,” Hall
claimed.

The Niederhauser Airways is a
flying school which also mains
tains private flying service. “In
the last year Nicderhauser has
taught more than 100 students
He has a flying instructor's rat-
ing, and he is credited with 2500
flying hours." Hall said.

"Nlederhauser has Just complet-
ed construction of a modern, gov-
ernment approved airport at I‘vIal'z
shalltown, and I feel that he is
qualified to take over here at
Grinncll if arrangements can be
made," said Hall.

25 Studenis of ‘Language of the Bolsheviki’ Begin to See
W by Finland Finds Russian Declensions a Little Disgustin’

 

By Robert Hu’tclil'son.

It you should, while strolling-
about the campus, come upon a
group of students singing “Dark
Eyes" or “The 'Vulgar’ Boatman's
Song" in a rather unfamiliar lang-
uage don’t be surprisedithey are
probably a fcw of the members
of Waltcr J. Schncrr's Russian
class showing off some of their-
sketchy knowtedge of the tongue
of the land of the Bolsheviki.

For the past four weeks. an
enthusiastic group that has varied
in size all the way from eight to
twenty-five persons has been
meeting at 4:30 p. m. on Wed-
nesday afternoons in room 29 of
the Alumni Recitation hall to ab-
sorb what they can of that form
idable language which Finlanders
in these times try not to com-

 

prehend.

Those taking the course are:
Virginia Geiger, Eleanor Vogel,
Ruth Gilman, Joan Baum. Mary
Griffin, Jack Wilson, Dan Morris.
Mr, Milton Wittler, Joseph Wall,
Genc Morse, Dorothy siinrall,
John Edwards, Robert Hutchison,
Amy Clampitt, Jean Fulton. Jean
Heinsen, Marjorie Kendall, Cecily
Barker. Gladys Storch, Barbara
Mullen, Margaret Currier, James
Russell, Faith Gait, Robcrt Hall,
and Marguerite Schalck.

Due to tho difficidty in obtain-
ing sztﬁsfilctol'y grammar books,
Schncrr is presenting the tcchni-
cal points of the language in the
form of class lectures.

The Russian language, the dif»
ficulty of which Schncrr com-
pares to Einstein's theory of re-
lativity, boasts an alphabet oi as
letters. The characters that for-m

this alphabet look like something
out of a maniac: dream,

The course is definitely not to
be recommended to those who
flurrked their high school Latin.
Whereas the Latin student has
three noun declcnsions, each With
fivc cases. to worry about, the
Russian student has eight differ»
cnt noun for-ms, each with seven
cases, to grey his hair pl'emae
turely.

Schnerr states that although
there is probably no languagc on
earth that is so ditficirlt to mas-
ter completely as Russian, a read
ing knowledge of it may be ac-
quired in a comparatively short
time.

Oh well, you probably didn't
want to sing “Vol Vistu Gaily
Star" in Russian anyway.
