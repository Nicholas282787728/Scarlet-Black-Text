Til-i Planned

Varsity to Play
Second Gridiron
Scrimmage Friday

The second spring intra-souad
game. to be held Friday aftel'r
noon on Ward field. will end the
1939 spring tootball practice.

According to Coach Guy Look-
aloaugh. the starting lineups will
not be released until game time.
However, it is certain that all
the 1338 lettermen reporting for
spring practice will be members
of one team. Capt. Howard
Grimes will be at center; John
Kennefick will he at a tackle pos-
ition; Norman Tschirley will he
at one guard; and George Little
will fill a halfback spot.

With is practice sessions com-
pleted. Lookabough is still not
satisfied with the work on funda-
mentals. Uncertainty and ragged~
ness is being displayed by sev-
eral memleers of the squad and
the last two practices will be de-
voted to erasing mistakes in
b‘acklng. tackling, and charging,
he declared.

Although Lookabaugh was
pleased with the results of the
first intra-souad game. he wants
to stress the importance of pass
ing. With the return of .Carlos
Kotilla to the squad. the throwt
ing department will be greatly
improved. Kotilla, fresbnian pass~
er. reported for practice Monday
and will participate in Friday's
game.

One of the neater tricks ot the
year was pulled at the Clark
housemeeting Monday. Things
were pretty quiet. so Mannheimer
faked a faint and cogswell and
Bill Fort, heroes that they are.
carried out the prostrated one.
Credit lines for the stunt go to
.Cogswell.

The driver who picked up Royser
and Gahagen this last weekend
was killed when he drove into a
train after dropping the hoys
somewhere along the line. Accord-
ing to Pat Black. who should
know them both fairly well. “They
said he drove about 87 miles an
hour. all Lhe Lime."

The announcement that Murphy
and McAnenSy are now going
steady was somewhat of a sure
prise. But when the facts were
known the shock was greatly les—
sened. It seems that Perkins and
Jacobsen started the whole thing
last weekend, Murphy was a lit-
tle pertuibed by this, so Monday
night action was taken. Both
qunditcs report, however, that the
whole thing is purely platonic.
and that "Spring in Grinnell" had
nothing whatever to do with it.
