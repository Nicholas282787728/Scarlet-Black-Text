FOR MORE PROGRAM DANCING

The recent rcetrial of program dancing, and
the use of it by the students, is commend-
able. The advantages it gives in more and
better social friendships are evident at first
glance. At second glance, the person who
has a “blind date" sees many more advant-
ages. Be that as it may, the fact remains
that, excepting, we surmise, in the special
cases where a smoke ring has a set in it.
there are greater opportunities for a joll-
pleasant, varied evening in a night of p17)-
gram dancing than in two and oneehalf
hours of matching wits and feet with the
same pair of shoes. Nothing is quite more
delightful than a change of shoes which
hurt.

If these considerations be kept ill mind,
the desirability of swapping dances is easy
to feel. Of course, there are opportunities
for abusing this system of program danc-
ing. For instance, if one finds an especially
desirable pa‘rtner, he may be tempted _~,o
pass up the change of dances. The social
committee happily forestalled such diffi-
culties by having the orchestra leader ali-
nounce the changes.

One abuse, however, that the social conr
mittee can scarcely prohibit, is capitaliza-
tion on inequalities The lively business-
minded person will see chances to alter what
is intended to be a barter system into a
profitsmaking enterprise. All that’s neces—
sary is to get the most desirable dancer on
the campus and demand some boot on all
exchanges.

These abuses, however, will scarcely be-
come general enough to overebalancs the ad—

OUR BEST WISHES

People who have been searching for a ves—
tigc of spirit in Grinliell might peek into
the men‘s gymnasium Friday night. A Grill-
nellsDrake game always draws more inter-
est and enthusiasm than any other athletic
event. Last year over 1,100 people crowded
into the gymnasium to watch the annual
renewal of the feud between the schools.

Such an enormous attendance sounds
good in the papers, but it is annoying to
have a fur coat creep into your mouth eve
cry time you open it to cheer the Pioneers
on, to say nothing of having your feet treat
ed like mashed potatoes by a shoving, Spiilt-
ed crowd. This year Grinnell has been fore:
sighted enough to obviate this difficulty bv
requiring that tickets be procured in ads
Vance. The semester fees may be exchanged
for admission tickets at the treaslll’or’s ole
[ice up llntil 4 pm. Friday,

As you know, this is a very important
garlic. The Pioneers, tied with Creighton,
stand second in the Missouri Valley confe- '-
clice, having won two games and lost one.
The Bulldogs, who are now ill sixth place,
so far have two losses as their record,

May we all be there to give the Pioncels
our support. May they keep up their good
record, not only because we wish to hold nil
uncontested second place in the conference,
but also because of the tradition that is as-
sociated with the Drake game.

FlNlS--TliE SPANISH WAR

The news that General Franco’s troops are
within 50 miles of Barcelona is not- very
encouraging to Loyalist sympathizers, who
must face the fact that the Insurgents may
ultimately will the Spanish war. If Franco
wins, thrce powerful Fascist states will lie
against the borders of France, the last great
stronghold of European democracy. All out—
come more dangerous to general European
peace and to democratic government can
hardly be imagined. '

But there is a ray of hope. Franco may
win, but if he does he will have won with
the aid of Italian and German troops If
any fact in the war is well established, it
is that without the German and Italian
mercenaries Franco would have fall’d
months ago. His victory, if it comes, will
not express the will of the Spanish peopic
but that of the world’s tlvo most powerful
dictators.

Fo those who sympathize w'th Franco,
there i a parallel in ollr own history. Supv
pose in 1865 the South had won the Civil
“or and won it with the aid of British
troops. The victor, would not have been
permanent; either the North would not
have remained subdued, or the South would
have turned against her allies. Possibly in
this not only American sympathizel's with
the Insurgents but the Insurgents then;-
sclves might find a lesson, if they choose
to regard it.

OPEN FORUM

 

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear lVII‘. Rowley:

A copy of the Grinnell Scarlet
and Black, published under date
of Saturday, Jan. 7, has Just
reached me, and I have read With
a great deal of interest the edi-
torial, “Is Criniioll Slipping?"

I would greatly appreciate it
if you would mail me about ten
copies of the issue mentioned.

If you feel that you would like
to expand upon the subject cov-
ered by your editorial, I should
be glad to have you do so.

I may say that many of the
alumni are somewhat concerned
about the present situation at
Criiincll, and your point of view
should be most helpful to them.

_Leivis n. Barrett,

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

The half page of veibiage which
has so successfully gonc wool-
gatlicring among some of your
ci-innoll sheep was pci-haps the
most disgusting abuse of your
flcedom of press to date. “Is
Ci-innell S‘ipping?” you ask; then
you throw banana skins around
llke a bunch of monkeys on a
spree.

May I quote you? “As an organ
of campus opinion and as a free
press we feel it is our bounded
right and duty to criticlze and
point the way when we feel that
we have a way to point." Yes.
you felt a way, a publications pro-
gram which would add five dol-
lars' worth of sore thumb to an
already high all-inclusive fee.

The trustees sensibly acted neg-
atively on it. Now, let’s see if we
can feel another way (We do too
much dating and dancing to think
of one, but not too much to feel
one). Maybe a little economy
might help? Would anybody be
bold enough to start on the frow-
zy imitations of night clubs we
use at our well-attended house
parties”!

—Lee McIntosh.
To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr Rowley:

Congratulations on your recent
stand on the question “Is Griiinell
Slipping 7" You are not alone in
your view As far as can be use
ccrtaincd, there are approximately
some 700 students that believe
Ci-innell is slipping! So far, you
alone have had the courage, de-
termination, and initiative to do
something about it!

May I suggest the followulg?
Instead of attempting to revolu-
tionize, we will reform. Instead
of asking foi a new setup, we
will try to mold the present or
gaiiizatioii into that type where
by it will be able to and WILL
supply our needs.

Most important to us is the fact
that reform has the better chance
of success. Pick out somc definite
project that we wantithat we
need, such as an athletic plant
(because of being at the source of
nioie comprehensive information
than most of us, you wou'd be a
better Judge of what the initial
step would be) and thou FIGHT
for it!

The Alumni Recitation hall, an
annual, and an opportunity for a
student Center are a fcwxxamv
plos of what can bc won by a
concentrated, believing minority
in a fight for what is a necessary
"reform,"

Your leadership at this time is
helping Gunnellieven if the stu-
dents dci-ive no other advantage

 

from it but being awakened fiom

their state of lethargy!
—R. R. M.

To the Editor of the

SCARLET AND BLACK:

Dear llll‘ Rowlcy:

As a member of tho Gi-iiiiiell
college faculty, vitally interested
in the future of this institution, 1
was deeply affected by your coi-
torial, “Is Gl'iuuell Slipping?” . . .

First, the question you raised
has arisen periodically on this
campus, even in the days which
we now regard as the Golden Age
of Ci-iniiell college. It comes tam
1y iegularly at this time of year.
It was often and is now due to
individual dissatisfacuons which
may become contagious.

secondly, I can assert without
bias that Grinnell college is not
slipping academically. For this
assertion I have the uniform testi-
mony of professors and adminis-
trators of other colleges with
whom I come in contact in my
rather frequent visits as preacher
and lecturer.

Very recently, whenI exclaimed
almost enviously over a new
building at another institution,
the reply was, “But you have
better library facilities, many
more books, a larger and more
competent facility, much greater
academic frcedom, and an intan-
gible something which is not of
brick or ston Added proof
come from students who have
gone to other education institu-
tions, larger and in some respects
better equipped than ours . .

I readily admit that crinnoll
college may lose the distinction
which lifted it to the high place
which it still holds. That would
be due to no failure of our ad-
ministratoi-s, but to a general fle~
cline in religious and idealistic
values.

On this Monday morning, less
than a per cent of the student
body was at chapel, and the ser-
vice was in charge of one of the
most prominent and popular men
on the faculty. Last Sunday's
Vespers drew about half of that
percentage, when the musical pros
gram alone was worth much more
thanithe effort necessary to walk
across the campus to attend the
service.

The glory of Crinnell college
has been its religious heritage, ins
creased and cnriched each year
by the contribution made by the
incoming freshman class which
now seems to consider it a dis
tinction not to attend either
chapel oi- vespci-s. ‘

Unfortunately, the Crinnell
campus has not felt the resur-
gence of religious idealism which
is manifesting itself in other
places, and which is so necessary
if we are to save those democrat-
ic institutions in whose existence
Crinnell college has so vital a
stake. Democratic institutions
cannot function without religion,
for democracy itself is a rcligioiis
concept . . .

Once more let me thank you
for your editorial, It may he
Justified if it lifts us out of the
spiritual doldrums into which we
have fallen, but the attack needs
to be lcvclled, not against the
administration. but against all of
us, faculty and student, and stu-
dent leader, mony of whom have
lost the visions without which
colleges as well as people per-
ish.

I know that our problem is his
so a financial one, and there is
greater hope of solving it by a
i-eVitalizing oi the Grimiell Spire
it. which is basically re‘iglous,
than by carping criticism of the
administration,
