Saturday, February 18, was

meant HOME!

Grinnell will be honored and privileged to
enteltain within the next week two famous
alumni, Chester C. Davis, member of the
board of governers of the Federal Reserve
system and Harry Li Hopkins, United
States secretary of commerce. Secretary
Hopkins will come to Grinnell on his way
to Des Moines where he will make his first
address as Secretary of Commerce, while
Dzu is will come from Des Moines where he
addressed the National Farm Institute
Thursday night

We are especially fortunate in that Hop-
kins will be here for several days before
continuing on to Dcs Moines Several meetr
ings and entertaining events have been ar-
ranged for the secretary, but it is to be
hoped that his visit will be as informal and
as mllcb of a getetoeg‘ether with old friends
as possible.

Wednesday morning in chapel Hopkins is
scheduled to make an informal talk. Un-
doubtedly there will be a large tllrnout for
chapel that day and deservedly so.

Since graduating from Grinnell, Harry
Hopkins, ’12, has gone a long way and has
been entrusted with many public offices.
While there has been much criticism of the
policies he has used, no one has criticized
the integrity with which he fulfills the
duties of his office, the integrity of a true
Grinnellian.

FINGERPRINTING FOR THE MEN

Within the next few days, the men who
live in the dormitories are going to have a
rather novel experience. They will all be
fingerp inted by a group of volunteer stur
dents working under the direction of Fred
Homann, president of the Pre-Law clllb.
The fingerprints will be sent to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in Washington and
placed n the civil file. The prints in this
file are kept separate from those of crim»
inals, and are used to identify bodies, to aid
amnesia victims, to help the police in kid-
napping cases, to identify lost children, and
so forth.

The goal of the F.B.I. is to have the fine
gerprints of every citizen in the United
States on file ill Washington. With the sy~
stem of classification whch has been de-

veloped, it is possible to match any set of
prints sent in to F.B.I. headquarters with
the identical set in the files in a few mine
utes, and to mail a complete description of
the person so identified back to the one who
sent the prints in. Identification is quick
and positive.

A great many Amercans are voluntarily
taking advantage of the opportunit the
Canon give everyone to be fingerprinted.
They feel that it is their advantage to be
permanently identified, so that in case of a
bad accident, in which they might be killed
or knocked unconscious for a long time,
their relatives and f . lids would at least
know what had happened.

The mell of Grinnell have voted favors
ably, taking this Sallie attitude of precau-
tion, and soon each one will have a perman-
ent record and a positive identification on
file at Washington.

The process of bong fingerprinted is sime
ple, but its results may be of great value
at some time when identification is im-
possible by ordinary methods. In backing
this program, Grinncll men have given an
other example of the pioneer spi 't for
which the college is justly famous.

HARRY HOPKINS' BIG JOB

"To Speak Soitly and Carry ii nig Stick“

With the arrival Monday of our noted alums
nus, the Honorable Secretary of Commerce,
affectionately known by us as ”Harry,” it
doesn’t seem inappropriate to comment on
his new job, especially since he himself
will comment on it in his Des Moines
speech Friday.

You may remember that soon after the
election last fall it was indicated in these
columns that the President without back—
slidillg on his reforms would nevertheless
play up more to the business and industrial
element of the nation,iand after all they
are all impor ant element.

We have witnessed during the last few
years all sorts of direct and indirect econ-
omic and political aid and comfort given by
the New Deal to agriculture and to labor,
two of the nation’s most important elements.
These two elements had previously taken
back seats under a political part, almost
exclusively controlled by business.

It is the opinion of these columns that
the New Deal ill trying to redress the inn
balance went too far and created a. new un»
balance. While we believe that more than
90 per cent of the New Deal reforms were
long overdue, that they were not only good
for the nation as a whole, but also ill the
long run good for business, we do lnost
heartily disagree with the speechemaking,
fan-fare, and often times the diatribes that
went with the reforms. The reforms were
good, but the diatt'ibes (usually for political
purposes and we recognize the part ”poli-
tics” must play ill getting any momentus
reform across) and harangues were enough
to scare the wits out of business. Capital is
a very, very sensitive and coy thing in spite
of the blustering speeches of hard boiled
capitalists Capital needs coaxing as well as
reforms. Capital must have that ephemeral
thing called ”confidence,” and it can only
get it by “speaking softly” to it (In this
respect it is like a perpetual bride and
needs to be treated as such.)

Theodore Roosevelt said that his Watchr
word was “to speak softly and carry a big
stick.” Shouldn’t that be the polic of the
President? As a matter of fact it is ollr
guess that the President is going to use
that policy. And what is more natural than
to choose one of his most able lieutenants
to aid him ill it. Yes, business still needs
policing, but it needs “soft words,” gracious
looks, and plenty of coaxing as well. The
fa'ners, the workers, the nation needs a
business system that has “confidence” in
itself.

Accompanying Mr. and Mrs.
Phelps will be Mr. and Mrs
George siisens of Minneapolis,

Minn.

Recently. Without having seen the
moving picture version, without
having conned reviews full of exe
travagant plajso or cynical dis-
paragement, I plunged into the
multitudinous pages of "Anthony
Adverse." I did not read to find
fault with the authors use of
historical material, to condemn
hlln for not making Anthony
more of a person and less a hem
of adventure. nor to cxoriate him
for wilting complete and ade-
quately phrased sentences instead
of the constipated staccato style
popularized hy the writers of the
post-war oi-a. i read for enjoy-
ment, and the reward was an ime
mensely rich. imaginative experi-
ence.

“Anthony Adverse” is a roman—
tic historical novel of the picares-
one type in which the reader for

The theme of “Anthony Ad-

says, is “that it is impossible to
inake a business of life; to con-
duct it on a basis oi things, and
that. if final satisfaction is to
be attained, the physical world
and the body must be subdued
to the higher values discernible
to the heart, the intellect, and

“Anthony Adverse" may not be
the great American novel. It

that the reader is always more
interested in what happens to
Anthony than iii Anthony him—

Honor ‘G’ Supports
Daytime Traditions
On Central Campus

At a meeting held last Wednes-
day night, thc men‘s Honor “o"
club decided to institute a cam»
paign against smoking on the
crinnen central campus fiom sun
up until sundown.

The cluh voted unanimously to
ask for cooperation of all stu-
dents in carrying out one of the
time honored traditions of the
college.

Fred Luther, president of the
chili. explained to the inembeis
that smoking would be pvrmlttcd
on Park street in front of the
chapel and Alumni Recitation hall
as that is not a part of the canir
plls‘ proper. ,

East of the M, and St. L rallr
road tracks and north of Eighth
avenue on the men’s campus are
tht- other zones that constitute
“off campus” in the immediate
cn‘lege viciniu.

”The club feels that i‘ isn't

much of the udeiits in Carrying
out this campaign," Luther said
