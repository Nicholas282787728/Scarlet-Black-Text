BEFORE WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS

An Editorial
Next Saturday in these columns will appear two editorials taking

divergent points of view as to America's attitude in regard to the;

current European and world crisis.

Some Americans have already made up their minds in regard to
this crisis and any events that may flow from it. They are the
absolute pacifists. the isolationists, the collective securityists, the
Anglophites, the Cennanophites, etc,

However, such is not the case with most Americans. The latter
are sincerely interested in finding the best solution for their country
and for the world. They are not doctrinaire, and they haven't made
up their minds. Their confusion has made the policy of this country
somewhat confused.

it is with this thought in mind that we venture to point out that
Americans should ask themselves: ‘

(1) wherein does our immediate and ultimate self-interest lie?

(21 What are our moral obligations, if any?

(a) What psychological forces are operating on us in spite of
moral obligations. self-interest and reason?

We can take it as axiomatic that we are not seeking any particular
aggrandisement of our own. Our selfrinterest is not along that line.
Also we know that as the cost of war is far greater than any possible
economic favor resulting from a “Victory," our self-interest is evi-
dently not along that line.

But do we have any self-interest in the preservation of British
sea power in the Atlantic as in reality our own “first line of de-
fense" ? American history is filled with examples of our dependence
on British might. Perhaps even today self-interest demands that we
use strength to presel‘veﬂBritish power. Perhaps a destruction of
British navai power and the British empire would be a first class
blow to the United States. Americans should be thinking of this
question and all it implies before their minds are made up for
them.

our moral obligations can be looked at from two distinct angles.
There are those who say that man's chief loyalty is to God, a God
of love, that under no circumstances can force and Violence be rec-
onciled with love, that using an evil means to crire an evil only
results in more evil and brings no good to anyone, that absolute loy-
alty to God means absolute pacifism. that any alternative to resis-
tance (resistancc, of course. might lead to war) is better than war.

They are unwilling, even for a moment to give their loyalty and
support to anything but a God of love whose commandment is to
“love your enemies.”

On the other hand. some equally sincere religious people feel that
moral obligation compels them to refrain from any war of aggrcs
sion for their own country, but they would support their country in
a war undertaken by it on behalf of other peoples that have been
assaulted or on behalf of some universally recognized good. In other
words, the use of force, violence and war is only an evil when used
for selfish aggi-andisement, but such force reccivcs moral sanction
when undertaken to help an assaulted party.

Any student with any religious convictions that mean anything at
all should think his way through on this question oi inoral obliga-
tion.

In regard to the psychological forces that motivate the American
people, we are prone to take such forces for granted and to under
estimate their importance. We are too Willing to find a scape goat
in munitions makers, international bankers, paid propagandists and
the like. not realizing that powerful psychological forces can be nu1~
lified.

We are destined to go to war again, even though self-interest null
moral obligations siioiild oppose such entrance into a war!

Before we make up our minds, we should find out all we can about
(it our self-interest in this crisis, (2) our moral obligation in it, and
(a) the psychological forces pulling us toward a definite commute
merit.

‘Journey’s End’ to Be Presented
Tomorrow, Saturday at 8:15 P. M.

By John Marion.
Last night we attended a dress
rehearsal of “Journey’s End,"
which will be presented by the
drama department tomorrow and
Saturday nights.

The play. although devoid of
any overt action, is a powerful
drama that is strongly presented
and is aided greatly by excellent
lighting. In some instances the
lighting was so effective that it
stole the action of the play.

There are several excellent char-
acterizations. especially good is
William Seidlei- as the easy going,
cairn officer who is the steadying
influence among the men.

Every scene in which he appears
is stolen by Joe Wall as the cocks
riey cook who tries hard to please
everyone. in a bit part Gordon
McCarty is fine as a captured Ger-
man soldier.

Brown Barr is good in spots, but
weak in many, as the commander
of the dugout, Robert Kinsey and
Ken: Hampton also do exception-

ally good acting.

.The costumes are not flashy,
but are drab as they should be for
the army uniforms. These uni-
forms had to be rented from a
costrrme company in Omaha and
are new to the play goers in Crin-
nell,

The action all takes place in a
front line dugout, and as the scen-
ery docs not change the lighting
must. In one scene, the final fade
out is so effective that even the
actors seem inspired.

Throughout the play there are
constant noises irorn the bur-sting
bombs and machine guns, These
bombs are preceded by the whist-
ling which is done by Mary \Vhet-
stone. The rest of the sound crew
are Mary Frances Hall and Betty
Ley.

Stage manager is Betty Young,
assisted by Margaret Hawthorne.
Tire light crew is composed of
Mary Shaw, Ruth Schultc and
Eleanor Hayward. Property mana-
gei- is Marjory Ruth Booz.
