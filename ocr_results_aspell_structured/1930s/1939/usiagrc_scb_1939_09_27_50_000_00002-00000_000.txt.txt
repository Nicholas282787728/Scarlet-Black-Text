UNIFORM ACTION

Grinnell College students are looking for-
ward to Friday night of this week for two
reasons. We will have the opportunity to
see the fighting Pioneers in action on the
football field for the first time, and also to
thrill at the sight of our fifty-five piece
band, resplendent in new scarlet and black
uniforms. The precise step of one hundred
and _ten marching feet will usher in a new
era for the Grinncll College band. However,
when we Watch this well-trained, well-
groomed band march onto the football field
Friday evening, let us not forget the follow-
ing facts.

It has been only by the diligence of R0—
bert Vagner, the band director, and the
generous support given by the alumni asso-
ciation, the college administration, and the
Gllnnell businessmen that the purchase of
uniforms was possible. Moreover, the
superior quality and handsome appearance

of the new uniforms have necessitated the
outlay of a sum such that we really have
little more than a mortgage on them. It is
up to us as students to help meet the re-
maining deficit in the following ways.

In the first place, if you have not already
done so, buy a varsity ticket. Proceeds from
their sale will make a sizeable dent in the
deficit. They may be purchased at the en-
trances to both the men’s and women‘s
dining rooms, at the college book-store, and
from any member in the band.

In the not-so—distant future, October 14,
the Grinnell—Simpson football game will
afford townspeople and alumni an opportu—
llity to help, for a goodly part of the gate-
receipts will be turned over to the band
fund. After the football game, an allc
Icollege dance benefit for the band will be

old.

We will be proud of the band Friday eve-
ning. Let us carry over this pride into

active support for the band.

TO THE TOWN ME

Now that ”the tumult and the shouting” of
New Student Days and of registration has
died, you town men are called upon to make
an important decision. Each of you either
has already chosen or must soon choose the
hall with which you are to be affiliated for
the coming year. This choice is an im-
portant one, and it is left to you alone to
make. Make it slowly, carefully, and
thoughtfully Choose any hall you wish,
according to your own best interests. Re-
member, however, that ﬂie mere act of
making a choice will not make you a part
of any hall. Choosing your hall is a first
step, nothing more.

Your affiliation with the hall of your
choice will be exactly as close or as loose as
you care to make it. You will be invited to
the smokers and house parties which your
hall holds, it is true; but your attendance at
these relatively sca ce functions will give
you only a bare minimum of contact with
the hall residents. To get to really know
the fellows with whom you will be asso—
ciated will require a little initiative on your
part. So don’t wait for a special invitation
to go up to the dorms and get acquainted.
Make the club room your headquarters#
most of the fellows drop in there after
meals, at least. You will not be disappointed
at your welcome, if only you show enough
interest to take the first step. Don’t be
afraid to use this opportunity to broaden
your circle of friends and to make your hall
affiliation really mean something this year.

SIGNS on THE TIMES: Grinnell
is slipping. Anyhow, the dean of
men, who never forgets a face
(especially ours) or name, failed
to deliver the goods for freshman
Jack Sloan in the far-famed re-
ception line as of Saturday night.
It must have been the hour . . . .
Now that the bOIdS are back, the
Campus walks are once more liv-
ing up to their titles as Grin-
hell's Great White Ways . . . .
The latest dope is that Somebody

plans for fireplaces, tebles, et a1,
go through, there won't be enough
room to spread a blanket!

Does the U. S.
Want Roosevelt’s
“True Neutrality”

-————By William 0. Harris.
William 0. Harris
Congress has convened and
Roosevelt II has spoken, demand-
mg that the United States as-
sume is “true neutrality” by the
repeal of the existing neutrality

legislation.

By Home neutrality," of
course, Roosevelt means the
lifting of the present embargo
upon the shipment of was to
belligereuts sud the replace—
ment of that embargo with a
“cash and curry" system or
with a return to “international
low" As the statute now
stands, all shipments of mind-
tions of war to belligerents or
to those ueutml countries ree-
sonably supposed to be agents
of belligerents are prohibited,
alﬂlongh no stoppage is ef-
fected in the shipments of sec-
onllary mutcricls of war such
as raw cotton, steel plate, or
oil.

It has been our psi Franklin’s
(fond hope that the boys on Cap-
itol Hill would junk, these trouble-
some restrictions entirely and re-
vent to what he terms ”interna»
tiohel law.” All of which. in
reality, would be to give the Pre-
sident a. “carte blanche” in the
conduct of our relations with the
warring countries under a code
of high-sounding. but seldom
obeyed, international legal jargon.
But failing that—and Roosevelt
has enough native intelligence to
foresee the improbability of such
a grant from a distrustful Con—
gress—the President is plugging
for the SoAcalled "cash and carry"
plan.

The main advantage of the
“cash and carry" idea. insurer
:15 Franklin D. is concerned is
am it gives thc cage in buy-
iug materials of war to Great.
Britnin and France, while the
present cmbhhgo on munitions
works more or loss in fcvor of
Germany by denying the mili-
tary output at American indus—
try to the allies regardless of
their control of the seas. If,
on the other lmud, that output
is opened to thc countries who
can comc in their own ships
and pay cash, Great Britain
cmd llcr cohorts \vill be the
benciuctors, inasmuch as His
Majesty’s navy jolly well go-
ing to see to it that none oi
friend Adulpli's cargo hunts tote
any chuuou balls to Germany.

But as for the “cash and carry”
plan being a system of “true neu~
tl'ality" any more than the pre-
sent actithat is but a tempting
dose of administration Eycrwash
to catch the ear of the Amer-
ican people. Neither system is
fundamentally neutral from all
points of view, as has already
been pointed out. Thus the crux
of the matter is thi , Since hei—
ther is absolutely neutral, which
plhh affords us the most assur-
ance of keeping oul' country out
of the European war?

Again, there is d good lien!
to be said for and against both

plans, but it: is our conviction
that the present neutrality act,
embodying the arms embargo,
gives American neutrality the
greater protection. To open a
war trade in munitions "would
greatly augment e um boom
that already threatens to in-
llme our national economy to
artificial proportions, a process
which must inevitably be fair
lowed by a chaotic reaction.
Furthermore, rather than see
our Wartime prosperity collapse

 

 

Men's Glee Club
Trials Scheduled
Tonight at 7:30

Tryouts for the Men's Glee Club
will be held tonight at 7:30 p. m.
in Herrick chapel instead of
Tuesday night as previously an-
nounced, according to Blake
stern, president of the organiza-
tion. Thcse intending to try out
are asked to come prepared to
sing some song of their own
choice.

Although the group is limited
to 24 regular members and a few
alternates for each part, Stern
invited all the men on the cam—
pus who have had any singing
experience whatsoever to try out.

In addition to the regular spring
concert, the group plans to make
a short concert tour, probably
during spring vacation.

SOCIAL BUDGET MEETS.

The Social Budget committee will
meet Thursday at 7:30 p. m. in
the quadrangle drawing room,
Josh Kuyper, chairman of the
committee, announced today.

when the belhgcreuts' cash runs
out, our “cash and carry” is al-
most certain to give way to
”credit and deliver” to maintain
the boom. And, if the credit geLs
shaky, the odds are we'll send a
military expedition to reestablish
it. At least, it worked that way
before. Wouldn‘t it be far wiser
to keep our guns at home than
play with a fire that burned us
once? .
