Sew and Sews
Wowed by New

Sewing Machine
By Anne While.

The Social Budget committee,
ever the cagey ones, has hit an»
other home run, and produced
from the great outside world into
the time weary halls of fourth
floor Main. a new, ch»so-pedchy
sewing machine. And now the
quaditos are sowing seams on
slips while old So-dndaso's of the
dorms swear.

Lovely to behold, lovelier (D
operate, and boasting the ultra-
ultra in latest attachments, this
super-addition to quad life rests
in the stately and celestial glory
that only Main "attic" can offer.
Extra special features are a real
electric motor and a needle that
‘sews Tom and 'ztit.

Verne Harding reigns supreme
over the treasure, but for she
who crosses the hand of Miss
Harding with a little silver, the
iuse of the machine is assured.
The rats is one and one-fifth mills
'a minute or fivc’cchts an hour.

When pressed for a statement,
Rachael Holmes, chief moneyvtuss-
er of the sac, was too excited
about the whole affair to say
more than a breathless, “Every-
body PLEASE use it."
