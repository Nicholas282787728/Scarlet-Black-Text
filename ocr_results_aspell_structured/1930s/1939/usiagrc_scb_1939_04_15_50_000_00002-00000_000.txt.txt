WE'RE ON OUR WAY

Hardly does a new administration of the
Scarlet and Black realize that it has been
elected to manage the campus newspaper
for the coming year when the questions are
raised, “What are you going to do“.7 What
is your platform? What is your attitude to—
ward the ‘Is Grinnell‘ controversy?” To
these queries our answer must be that we
are not in a position to do anything. Overt
action must rest with the Grinnell student
body and administration. The Scarlet and
Block can not, has not, and will not attempt
to “inn" campus affairs. We believe that
the legitimate editorial function of a college
newspaper is not to say, “Do that;" but
rather to ask, “Why don‘t you do or why
have you done that?" The best that any
student paper can do is to inquire and slig-
gest. not demand.

We sympathize fully with the progressive
policy of the last administration, and it is
our earnest desire, as it was theirs, to selwe
the best interests of Grinnell. When we raise
a question, it will be with the belief that a
frank answer will work toward a greater
Grinnell, and when we make suggestions it
will be with the complete understanding
that their furtherance depends upon the
support and cooperation of both the student
body and the administration.

The Scarlet and Black can serve the cola
loge best by reflecting student opinion and
aiding student objectives. However, if stue
dent opinion is stagnant, or if student lead-
ership becomes lethargic, our efforts will be
futile.

As our administration begins we realize
that we will make mistakes. It is also ob-
vious to us that we cannot please all groups
and all individuals on the campus at all
times, but we will attempt to present the
news as accurately and completely as we
know how. However, try as we may, we
cannot create news; but rather we lnust de—
pend upon active student organizations to
make news.

The Scarlet and Black belongs to the coll-
scious students of Grinncll, and its success
during the coming year depends on their

support.

PRO AND coll —

The threat of war hangs solemnly over the
world and most people undoubtedly feel
helpless and lost in the face of it. Here ill
this country various thoughts and feelings
are being expressed. After allowing for de-
tailed differences, these llmcllts boil
down to this: 1. We should join forces with
France and England ill some use of force
(maybe economic only, maybe limited to
navy and air force and war materials, may-
be full participation in military adventures)

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

against Germany and Italy, and probably
Japan, because: a. France and England are
fighting for democracy and hence, in a
sense, fighting for us too; b. France and
England are fighting for international law
and order and peaceful changes as against
blackmail, violence, etc., and it is to our ill-
terest to create and preserve a system of
world change; c. In a world growing smaller
alld smaller “peace is indiolsiblc" and any
outbreak of war will ultimately drag in all
great powers. Hence it is to our interest
to recognize this fact and prepare to act
immediately in concert with those nations
whose policies are lnorc akin to ours; d.
France and England have shown themselves
to be more moral than Germany and Italy,
alld it is our moral duty to support the
moral belligerent; e. The English fleet is
really a great protection to us. Hence it is
to our interest to support the nation and
the empire on which the fleet is built; f,
The American people have shown that they
are emotionally Mid psychologically involved
in the dispute already and when sufficient
occasion warrants it they will jump ill at
once. Hence all the talk about America
keeping ollt of war is pure bunkait is based
on all unsound knowledge of the American
people.

2. We (should stay out of the approaching
war and be absolutely neutral and aloof poli-
tically and economically because: a. This
is not (1 bottle of democracy versus dicta-i
toi‘sltip, but a battle of status-quo imperial-
islns against emergent imperialisms, and
Europe has had such imperialistic wars be-
fore; b. This is not a battle foy internation-
al low and order as such, but just a fight
to maintain the status—qua which just hap-
pens to be sanctioned by law at the present
time; c. We have no right to force our
ideas of moral right and wrong on Germany
and Italy when our own moral record is so
spotted and dirty; d. A superior morality
says that all war is immoral no matter what
the excuse or reason for participation, and
it is our duty, therefore, to abstain from
any force or violence; 9. We are thousands
of miles from the scene and causes of con-
flict, and its effect on us will not be great
if we keep our heads; f. We do not need to
defend the British empire alld fleet for our
owll protection. We are fully capable of
defending our own interests without them;
g. The American dcsii‘c for peace is greater
than (my superficial crusading emotion
which from time to time takes hold of us,
and wise leadership will try to foster this
deep-seated desire for peace instead of “egg—
ing on” our excitable emotions.

What can we believe about these argu-
ments? Where can we take ollr stand? It
is ollr opinion after analyzing the pros and
cons that: 1. France and England are not
only fighting for their power, prestige, alld
imperial domain, but are also fighting for
democratic ideals; both are mixed together.
2. France and England are not really ine
terested in international law and order as
such, but only for the sake of maintaining
the prevailing status quo, 3. Peace is ill-
dlvisiblc alld we will be ultimately dragged
into war unless we can prevent it, either
through peaceful compromise or through
use of superior force. 4. We have in the
past been dependent on British power, and
if it is destroyed we will have to increase
our owll naval and military p0\' r at great
expense. 5. The moral responsibllity of the
American people is not easy to decide and
there are weighty religious and moral argu-
ments ill favor of participation and also ill
favor of complete abstention. _

These conclusions scam to indicate that
we should co-operate with Britain and
France in case they are forced into a war.
This does not mean that we must necessar-
ily embark upon full illilitmm piezuli'tltion.
Rather it is our belief that economic partial—
ity might be sufficellt, and naval and air
force participation at the most.

However, please note that war has not
yet broken out. This is important. Our
President can still use last minute endeavors
to stave off war by active leadership in pro-
posing to the whole world that “a peace of
justice and law be attempted again.” This
means real leadership, not more acquiescence
ill drift toward and war and participation in
it.
