THE GRINNELL COMMONWEALTH

The f 'st objective of the aliunni work is
the creation of the Gi'iniiell Commonwealth;
and the Commonwealth is dedicated at every
point to the building of a greater Grinnell.

The Commonwealth includes all Grinncll
people; and these people may be expected to
understand better than any other group the
mission and the opportunities of the college.
Liberal education has never been more im-
portant, but it has seldom faced greater
difficulties. There is, for example, a drift
among young people into hasty occupational
training. Such training has its place. But
when it attracts excessive numbers there
are f8\l'€l‘ able young incl and women liberal»
ly educated for leadership; and this leader»
ship at present is of high public importance.
Grinnell alumni work includes all the old
friendships and memories; but to these
things it adds a nation—wide, co-ordinated
support of the liberal—arts program.

Because the day of large gifts to edu-
cation seems to be passing, the Common-
wealth includes in its work the organization
of the alumni funds. Some eighty ranking
colleges and universities have turned suc»
cessfully to their own alumni as those who
best understand their opportunities and
needs, Tile magic lies in massing many re-
latively small and frccly given annual gifts
into one large gift. The Commonwealth
offers the alumni an opportunity to perform
a like service for Grinnell. The success of
the project must turn upon understanding
and the desire to share ill a national Giinllell
service, It can not and will not be made a
coercive affair. The funds are but one pint
of the Pioneer eii‘o to promote the g ltel'
Gi‘iililell.

AS WE ARE!

Seniors, soon you will march ill a com-
lllcnccmcnt day parade. You here in Grin»
hell, and ill other parts of the country, tells
of thousands of college seniors this month
will don the academic cap and gown and sit
sleepy-eyed during numerous and lengthy
oi‘ations. You will rightly be told that you
are an exceptionally handsome graduating
class. You will likely and more rightly be
told that, ill View of your superior training,
a sick nation is lookillg to you to lead it
out of its present chaos—before it is too
late.

For at least fourteen years you have been

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

iccciving an education largely at public
:{pcuso Did you think that the govern-
ment (the people of these United States),
and those u ho endowed our private colleges,
spent such huge quantities of effort and
money simply to send you on your way to
smug personal prosperity? Nothing could
be further from the truth.

In direct proportion to thc yea s of train»
iilg' which you have received, if by no other
- ‘ 'ia, you as a privileged citizen have a
personal responsibility to direct your intelli-
gence to the solution of the problems which
exist ill our society. Democracy stands or
falls with the ideal that education will cli-
(low the people with a continuous determi-
nation to face honestly and fearlessly the
issues upon which the security and the
happiness of the nation depends.

James Norman Hull, chaiactci- ed thus

A STEP IACKWARD!

V hcil a situation demands immediate action,
there are two moves lviich may be taken.
One is a step forward; the other is .back—
ward.

The cribbing situation has recently been
so emphasized that some action was deemed
necessary, The action which was taken,
however, tends toward closer supervision
and more memory work. Judged from the
standpoint of a few courses, that trend is
good. Judged from the standioint of the
college as 21 whole, it ls (l step hdclcwmtl!

Whether the scale by which the policing
system be judged is all iilfuiltile—to-lllaiul'e
scale or a inenioi‘y-to-kllo“ledge scale, it is
still a step backwcrd. Because the use of
books and notes is 1' fused ill several courses
which have permitted them, the instructors
are forced to ask for more memory lrul ill
compal son with ability to collipreheud and
organize material.

In the “tests” of post-college lii' one is
often able, and usually does, use his study
material and the “cribs," or charts, which
he has prepared. It is ridiculous to think
of a bus. loss 9. ccutivc always intentionally
leaving his poitfolio, with pertinent tables
of statistics, graphs, and charts, at his offic.
when he attends a colliciencc.

This cdiio ' not all argument for
opcll»book exams ill all courses. As has
been said, the new examination system is a
good trend [or some classes, but it is DYEY—
donc by applying it to the entire curl" 'ulum,

ill the May 17th issue of tho Scflllct and
Black, the editorial board suggested that the
"proctoi'ing" system was the “most effective
way to deal with the problem.” The proc—
loi-illg system was there defined, perhaps
incorrectly, but as the campus poll intended
it, as depending upon “the instructors to
punish cribbing.” When each instructor
handled his own exaiililiatiolis, both situa-
tions of after-college life were pal‘ellelcd.
Now, only one is.

They is one i-cdccmillg feature, however.
about the new examination procedure. “The
committee believes that this plan is a step
toward the ultimate establishment of all
honor system.” It hopes, ill other words, to
make future steps forward. This step back,
therefore, is only to get a running start at
something better. But while it is a Stay)
back from the ideal, and could be improved
in minor points, this plan has shown itself
practical ill reducing actual cribbing.

Nazi Spy Film
Called Attempt

To Foster Hate

—By W.C.H.____

Today, News Views takes great
pleasure in nominating Warner
Brothers, Inc, for the Congros»
sional Medal in recognition of
their service to the country inl
exposing the diabolical activities
of Hitler's henchmen in the
United States in their recent pho-,
toplay, “Confessions of a Nazi
Spy."

iiiinciug no words, this re-
nusrkolilc flicker spreads the
machinations or the Berlin gov—
ernment across the screen for
all patriotic Americans to see.
For ninety minutes, we are
privileged to witness the in-
crodible sckemiugs or is power»
mad people as they carry out
their insidious campaign to un»
derrnlne our government and
overturn our democratic institu-
tions. \Vc are gilell the inside
dope on the real purpose of the
Nazi Bunds; we are shown that
they are but the shields {or a
fur-flung network of German
spies in this country.

We are informed of the Nazi
secret agents’ work in our muni»
Lions and airplane factories, or
their clever filohing of our latest
defense plans, and of their devil~
ish ingenuity in transmitting this
information to the Wilhelmstrassc,
We are shown the brutal methods
of the Gestapo, and we are given
intimate glimpses of secret con-
fel'ences in the German ministries
of war and propaganda. We see
tile German propaganda minister
give his American agents detailed
instructions, showmg them now
the Nazi government has divided
the United States into three
districts to facilitate their fiend»
isll work.

And finally, we till-ill to ﬁle
dazzling hminovork of the FBI,
as personiﬁed in our hero, Ed-
ward G. Robinson. We are told
that, in contlrlst to the German
intelligence department, “the
FBI has no third degree," and
we marvel at the iaimess and
cousilierutiou shown to the Nazi
spies by our operatives and at
the mercy given them hy our
courts alter having witnessed
the cruel menus employed by
the Germans. (in fact we are
tempted to shout, “ilHio, Sil»
ver: The Lone Ranger rides
irgdini”) Then, to cap the oil»
max, we hear “me voice oi the
people” damning ills Nuz to
the swelling chorus of “Ameri-
cm the Beautiful.”

Truly, Warner Brothers have
turned out a notable production,
and in so doing‘ have rcndel'cd :t
worthy service to their country.
To let each American citizen know
that there is a Nazi spy behind
every other lamppost, to inform
him that the Nazis are a half.
mad cult bent on (laminating the
world, and to show him how kind
we are to such poor, misguided
\vretches in contrast to the brutal
treatment of others is a cardinal
service to the nation.

Aside from some strictly min»
or faults, such as the obvious
lack of nrooi for the scenes in
the German ministries, a. reek-
ing anti-Nazi bus in tile mil--

OPERA c. VCELLED

The opera burlesque of college

gram as the commencement plays

(ion of the Gerlllitns in the light
of tile atrocity stories or 191.1»
1918, and the fact that Warner
Brothers forgot to mention that
they are mad at Hitler tor liav»
iug thrown some of their ﬁlms

a masterpiece. Again, we rec-
ommend Warner Brothers lor

that is that the medal be as
