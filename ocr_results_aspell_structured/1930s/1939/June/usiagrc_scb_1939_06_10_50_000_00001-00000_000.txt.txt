Survey Finds Employment Prospects for l 93 9 Graduates
Of American Colleges Brightest in Past Three Years

 

Employment prospects for 1939
graduatcs from American colleges
and universities arc brighter than
in the previous two years or in
1933, though less hopeful than
ten years ago, according to re—
sults of a national survey released
recently by the Investors Syndir
catc of New York.

Ninety-one per cent of the 14!;
institutions of higher learning in
the survey reported that 50 per
cent or more of their 1939 gradur
ates would have steady jobs bc—
forc the end of this summcr.

Job prospects the some or
greater than those of June. 1938
were prcdicted by as per cent of
the schools replying to the ques-
ticnnairc.

Promising prospects for this

 

year's college graduates, accord
ing to the survey, result from an
improvement in business condic
tions, greater efforts on the part
of colleges and universities to ob-
tain positions [or both men and
women graduates, and the fact
that leading employers are satis—
fied with employees recruited
from college campuses.

All around students, cspccially
those who worked their way
through college. have a better
chance of getting a job after
graduation than the campus hero
or the college “grind," results
showed.

Athletes and beauties, unlike o
few years ago, are not being
sought unless they can offer to
their prospective employers some

substantial qualities, such as
character, scholarship, adaptabil-
ity, leadership or personality.

According to the survey, pros-
pcctivc employers. in telling of
Ithc qualities that they demanded
of the graduates, mentioned chars
actor in 90.7 per cent of the
cases; scholarship, 89.1: adapta—
bility. 64.3; campus popularity
31.8; personality, 25.5; athl
prowess, 22.5; leadership, 17.3; and
extra-curricular activrties, includ-
ing outside jobs to help pay Cele
lcge expcnses, 14 per cent.

More book ability, factual
knowledge, high grades, numerous
degrces and studiousncss were
dccmcd relatively unimportant unr
less accompanied by other desira-
blc qualities.
