It is our opinion that the last
Doric almost inevitahly degener-
ates into Old Home Weelr. Hearts-
and-Flowers edition, or something
that can't be printed. 50. we have
taken the liberty of compiling- a
local march of time which is in-
tended to give credit where credit
is due. ,And, in the words of win.

In recognition of their year‘s £107
tivities, or some part thereof, we
confer the DORIC ORDER OF
THE ICY STARE on; Adkins
reading period calls to second
James on “strictly husiness;”
Curtis Moore’s impressionisln;
women who persist in looking
like Promeﬂleils»on-Lhe-ro:lis in
front or the quad; the 800 who
were too busy to go to chapel eve
ery day, hut packed the place to
hear Hopkins; all the smoothies
who have turned open house into
a series of smoothing parlors; all
men who leave their car keys at
the dean's office; the guys who
found the Cyclone; the ubiquity
of Dick stern; the dorms' horse-
meat.
