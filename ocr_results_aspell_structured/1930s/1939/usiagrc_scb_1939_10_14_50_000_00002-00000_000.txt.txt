COLLEGE HUMOR

November 11~a date celebrated in the
annals of history as the anniversary of the
signing of the armistice and a date to be
famed in the chronicles of Grinnell college
as the opening of this year’s Brooklyn con
ference. _

On that date our student leaders will sit
down with our administration and faculty
leaders, and, in the restful quiet of a rural
setting, they may bring forth ideas which
will influence the Grinnell student body for
years to come. Here, the cream of the crop
will meet to iron out the problems con~
fronting us here on the campus.

Thus, we have another instance of Grin—
nell's self—government which has given this
campus the tradition of being the _mid—
\vest’s premier example of student demo~
cracy, a tradition which exists along with a
good deal of other fiction only in the college
bulletin and handbook.

Last year, the League Board earned
Dol'ic’s congratulations upon its “carefully
careless” administration; the Council of
House Presidents also rated tllat column’s
felicitations upon its rigorous adherence to
its time—honored program of doing nothing
with more than the usual amount of vigor;
and the Student Council merited Zephyik
definition of its purpose as being that of
trying to discover an excuse for keeping the
outfit in existence

But this year is another year (we hope),
although student government, so far, is still
confined within the publication of the Public
Relations office, The slate has been wiped
clean, and the time has come for something
to be written on it, This year’s Brooklyn
conference has the opportunity to pick up
the chalk and write in capital letters It has
the chance to take the tradition of student
government out of the handbook and put it
on the campus,

Here is the challenge and the opportunity.
The way is clear to elevate student demo—
cracy above the level of chief campus joker
We await the results.

MORE GOLF?

Among the questions to be discussed at the
annual conference of campus student leaders
to be held next month is that of an all-
student membership at the Grinnell Country
club. Although there has been no definite
plan fonnulated for carrying through such
an idea, it has long been the consensus of
student opinion that such a move would be
an inexpensive and welcome addition to the

well-developed program of leisure time acti-l
: ies at Grinnell. Sonic discussion of the
problem may not be out of place.

Last year student agitation for member-
ship in the golf club started the wheels of
student government turning. A committee

was appointed to investigate the matter

and a recommendation favoring- tllc more
was drawn up,
issue dropped out of sight with the only
leasoll advanced—no money.

This year tllc Student Council is once
more seriously considering the problem.
Realizing that there are even more golfers
on the campus this year than last, they will
probably make a more concerted effort than
before to provide a solution to the question,
The question remains, however: Will the
bugaboo of insufficient funds again invali»
date their decision?

GOLDEN AT TIMES

A very long time ago some uitty fellow
happened to observe that “silence is golden.”
Tile remark caught popular fancy and be-
came a max n, Like most maxims it lacks
universal applicability and is true only about
half the time, There are many cases when
silence is definitely not golden, for example
when a student is called upon in class, or
when the fans are asked to cheer at a foot,
ball game. In those two situations, silence
is off the gold standard.

In spite of the modem tendency to dc,
pl'eciate proverbs generally, the fact remains
that there are still many instances where
they can be applied to great advantage. To
get down to actual cases, silence is golden
in the dormitories of Grinnell college from
10:30 p, m until 7:00 a. m, at least. This
period of time is included in the so—called
quiet hours, which means that anyone who
makes a great deal of noise after 10:30 is
theoretically in danger of being punished by
the house council of his halll In too many
cases, this theoretical chance of punishment
is never translated into actuality at all. The
offenders go right on offending, unpunished
and unabashed Occasional offenders be-
come chronic offenders, because they are
rarely warned and almost never punished.
All this in spite of the fact that about half
the men in the dorms are in bed trying to
sleep at this time, and would welcome a little
cooperation from the rest. And although
sleeping is a rather dull way to spend one’s
time, it is a very necessary process.

In the way of a few constructive sug-
gestions for muzzling the louder mouths of
the dorms, why not have the house council
of each hall appoint one man on every floor
to keep a respectable amount of order after
10:30 at night‘.7

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“College tries to educate all sides of our
personalities, the mind, body, spirit and a
social sense which is a duty to the com-
munity, There should be four years of
happy life, and when the student is through
college, ways of serving her country will
open up through music, medicine, housing
and politics.” Barnard College’s Dean Vir—
ginia C. Gildersleeve urges today's under-
graduates to prepare themselves for service
to the nation.

“Don‘t be over-awed by our titles, our books,
our authority over you. This new world is
not all in the books or in our heads. Tell
us when you think we over»reach ourselves
and our knowledge. All of us do at times."
Dr. Robert S, Lynd, Columbia University,
tells students that they should stand to
gether with the faculty to work “to build
for the time after this war a better world.”

IN INTERVIEW l“

Gov, George A. Wilson, above,
in an evolusixe interview with
in Scarlet and Black reporter,
stated that he would not nd~
vise any young man to go into
politics, Governor Wilson said,
“It menus too many head-
aches.”

Stay Out of
Politics Says
Gov. Wilson

By William Buckley.
”Just a second. rellows, and I“l
be right with you. I don't think
that you have dates, on Tuesday;
at least when I was here we
couldn't have dates on Tuesday,
only Friday and Saturday.” So
spoke Governor George A. Wilson,
chief executive of the state of
Iowa, in an exclusive interview
to the Scarlet and Black.

when asked how young men
should break into politics, are
Governor smiled and said, “I'd
advise them not to try. It means
too many headaches."

Wilson went on to explain that
he did not mean that youth
should not maintain an interest in
government, but that there was
too much competition in politics
to make it advisable for new-
comers to enter the field.

In answer to the question of
whether Grinhell was too small
for the government sponsored
aviation course, Wilson said, "Cer-
tainly not, nothing is too big for
Grinnell."

wilson, member of the class of
'06, left Grinncll in 1903 in, order
to study low at iowa City, While
he was here he was on the has
ketball team. "I didn't get my
Honor G,” the chief executive
stated, “because the Honor ‘G’
came in as I went out."

The governor also added that
he saw the Dreke-Grinnell game
last Friday, and, considering the
competition, “I thought the team
did Very well."

Wilson was in town Tuesrlay'
addressing the iowa Grange at
the Methodist church.
