Editor's Note: These columns today represent diver-
gent opinions or the Scarlet and Black editorial
board on the question, “Resolved: That the United
States has no moral right to criticize the policies of
Hitler." Space permits only one argument each of
the aiiirmntire and negative.

WHO ARE WE T0 YELL?

One night last week a bespectacled gentle-
man told awidc-cyed audience ofhistoly-
mined Grinnellians that the United States
should forsake its policy of isolation in or—
der to clamp boycotts and elnbargoes on Hit-
ler and Mussolini. And, the otherday, else
gant Mr. Sumner Wells, underrsecretary of
state, delicately inferred in a speech that
the United States didn't like Hitler‘s conduct
ill Central Europe. And, on a recent Sunday
morning, certain prominent clergymen raked
Hitler over the coals in response to a re-
quest for such a raking from the Federal
Council of Churches.

These are but recent instances of the
"damlrthe-dictators” attitude which has as-
sailed the country, all attitude which seems
to have gained a considerable number of
friends here at Grinnell among both students
and faculty. There are many among us who
are now either wr' ging our hands over
Hitler's latest exploit ill Czecho-Slovakia, be-
wniling the ”flight from honor,” or exhaling
high-sounding platitudes about the moral
duty of the “great democracies" to stamp
out the “tyranny and persecution of the
swastika."

But just who are we to holler? Just where
are we so god—like that we can afford to re—
commend hate-begetting boycotts and em-
bargoes for the purpose of chastising those
whose actions and policies are but the very
duplications of actions and policies we oure
selves have pursucdiand not all of them ill
the far distant past, either! Since when have
We reached the apex of perfection, qualify—
ing us to tell other nations and other peo-
ples how to run their business?

We rail at Germany for annexing Austria
and the Sudetenland. We call Hitler vile
names because his ainiies marched into
Czechoslovakia, and we detest Mussolini
because he chased Haille Selalsse to Lolldon
and swiped his kingdom, But why? D'dn’t
We chase the Mexicans out of their te ory
above the Rio Grande and swipe it? Didn't
we stick a gun in Spain‘s back and pick her
pocket of the Philippines? Of course we
did! And it was less than a decade ago that
our marines were chasing the Nicaraguans
for the benefit of the United Fruit company.
Yet, we yell at Hitler.

We jecr at his breaking of his word. We
draw sarcastic cartoons about the instability
of his promises. Again, why? Where, ill all
the history of the world, is there a more
brazen example of national promiseebreakr
ing than in the United States government’s
dealings with the Indians? And since when
have om- politicians kept their promises?
But we sneer at Hitler.

We express our horror at Hitler’s treat
ment of the Jews, loudly cursing him as the
cause of their misfortunes. But why? We
held a whole race ill slavery until they were

freed as an incidental military policy ill a
war over states' rights. And today we have
our D. A. Rr’s#dear old patriots as they
are—who, because she is a negro, prevent
a great contralto from using their sacro-
Sanct Constitution Hall. There‘s an example
of our race tolerance and our inteltracial
relationships. And we shout at Hitler.

G—

LAWLESSNESS BY SILENCE?

We stayed out of the last general Euro-
pean war only two years and seven months!
The odds are heavily against our being able
to stay out of the next European conflagra-
tion for half that time. The very seriousness
of the international situation and the vital
interests we have at stake give us license
enough to criticize.

But the question arises is there any moral
issue involved? First of all, let us examine
some of the principles of international law.
Judge Dionisio Anzilotti, speaking for the
prevailing Positivist point of view, comes to
the basis of international law and says it
is the postulate room cunt seroundzt, or the
ti'ctlti'es or agreements must be absolved.
Thus, the doctrine, pacta smit scl'vcmda,
means that states are legally obligated by
their agreements because of the fundament—
al axiom that treaties are and must be bind-
ing. This theory that states are morally, and
legally bound by the rules of international
law to which they have given their consent
through treaty or custom is very close to
the facts of modern interstate relations.

For after all, doesn’t the standard of in-
ternational morals which we do have depend
upon the observance of the treaties, prom»
ises, and customs that do exist? We will ad-
mit that when they are observed, which, in—
cidentally, is most of the time, they are ob-
served becausc it is to our interest to do so.
We promulgate the treaties, make the prom-
ises, and observe the customs because it is
to ollr interest to do so, and, for most of
the time, it is to our interest: having made
them to keep them. We could not afford,
placing our reliance on treaties, not to crit-
cize others for not keeping theirs.

Every century brings its increase in the
number of treaties culminated and kept,
promises made, and practices hardened into
customs. It would take a very pessimistic
person indeed to maintain that our standard
of morals both international and national
is not an improvement over the morals of
past generations and centuries. We do not
need, however, to stop here. Treaties will
continue to be abrogated, promises broken,
and customs ignored as long as power poli-
tics play as big a part ill international afe
fairs as it does now. But merely because we
break a law does not prove that the law
does not exist; merely because we do not
observe a moral obligation does not extinv
guish that moral obligation.

Since there is no all-powerful internation—
al force to whip the nations of the world
into line, nations of the world must rely
on these treaties, promises. and customs to
preserve international order and must do
so regardless of how many times they are
broken They are the foundation of interna-
tional law and order and whatever gains we
have made must be accredited to them.
Therefore regardless of how many treaties,
promises, and customs we have violated in
the past, we are bound legally and morally
by the ones which we have now, so it- s
only logical to conclude that since we are
bound by the ones we do have, we have a
legal as well as a moral right to criticize
and object when they are violated, espe-
cially when the ones violated affect us so
vitally. Progress can only be made in this
way.

We can not sanction by silence, for one
minute, the over-running of a free and in—
dependent state by its overpowering neigh-
bor. To do so would be but to commit our-
selves as in agreement with the lawless polr
icy of the dictatorships. We ought to criti»
cize because of our position in world poli-
tics, and we should criticize because of our
vital interest ill the matter. if we were to
be silent, it would seem that this, this sort
of silence, would be a breach of moral eti—
quette rather than criticizing regardless of
how bad or naughty we have been in the
past.
