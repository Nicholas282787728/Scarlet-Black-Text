INDUSTRY'S ATTITUDE

“What is the matter with you college people
that you send graduates out into business
and industry, not knowing what they
believe and not willing to risk anything for
their beliefs? Industry needs intelligent, re—
ligious men—not to make money for it, but
to help solve its social and human problems,
which ultimately are Spiritual problems In-
dustry is life for all who participate in it—
and life should be religious.”

Dean Evelyn Gardner brought this state»
ment back from a recent convention she at—
tended, The remarkable thing about this is
that it was spoken by an industrial Engineer,
7'cp7'cscnting/ the National Association of
Manufacturers. Could there be anything
more important for the seniors as a class
to consider, especially the seniors going. on
the job hunt?

But it is not alone to the seniors that the
force aild meaning of this statement should
be directed. It is to our college generation
as a whole and the students at Grinnell in
particular that this statement should apply.
There is definitely a place on the Grinnell
college campus for religion, a workable reli—
gion.

Next Monday night several campus lead-
ers will meet to discuss the chapel situation
at length in all earnest endeavor to make
chapel programs of such nature that Grins
nell students will want to go in larger num-

'bers.

We welcome the suggestions of any mem-
ber of the student body, In the meantime,
it .is most heartening to notice the increase
in chapel attendance during the last part of
the week. Let us hope that this will continue
during the coming week.

You cannot spend a more
twenty minutes during the day.

‘SHOOT 'EM DOWN!’

“If we‘re ever goin’ t’ have law ‘n’ order in
the men’s dormitories, the fust thing we
gotta do is to take out all house council-
nlen an’ shoot ’em down like dogsl"‘

What we‘re getting at is, have some of
our house councilmen lived up to the pledge
they took when elected to office?

The situation as it stands in a few halls
is that everyone runs the halls but the
house councilmeii.

The freshmen come in and run the upper-
classmen; the upperclassmen, because they
may not paddle, appeal to the house coun—
cilmen for order in the hall; and the house
councilman, too intent upon remaining
”good fellows," hand the props a bouquet
and follow up by a laughing remark,
“Come on, boys, some fellows want to
study,”

worthwhile

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Here at Grinnell, we have time set aside
for work and for play; we have quiet hours
and we have recreation hours, Very well,
let us work when it is time to work, and
“raise hell” when it is time for that, too.

There is no reason why, when each stil-
dent is paying the same rent for his room,
that he cannot be entitled to quiet hours for
study or rest when quiet hours are supposed
to be in force,

There is no reason why the officers stu-
dents elect to enforce house rulings can-
not live up to the duty of their office. .

Breaking of transonls. building of fires
on the hall floors and general allearound
disturbance when quiet hours are supposed
to be in force are things which are not to
the credit of either the college or the stu—
dents as a whole.

We must demonstrate our pride in Grin-
nell by being builders, not destroyers, and
by showing a reasonable amount of con—
sideration for others who may, unknowing-
ly to some, have much to do in the way of
studies and other college work and may
have added responsibilities requiring addi—
tional rest.

A student shouldn’t have to worry about
losing his reputation as a good fellow be-
cause he demands his rights; 1101' should a
house councilman have to guard his good
fellowship to enforce hall rules.

“Shooting 'em down like dogs" may be
just a phrase, but it has its significance.
lf'Grinuell students, in the keeping of what
we pride in calling our "democratic sy»
stem," cannot be elected on merit, as well
as popularity, then we had better abandon
student government.

If hall officers cannot fulfill the duties of
their respective offices today, then they had
better abandon all hopes for leadership in
the future!

ENTER THE CONTESTS

The rarest of abilities is the ability to cre
ate.

Almost anyone with a little patient applis
cation can learn to run a typewriter, but
not very many can write original poems on
it. With more application one can learn to
play the piano, but although many play a
musical instrument well, very few have any
original ideas to express in music. Musicians
are common; composers are r re.

The gift of creating is so infrequent that
it is generally well rewarded, not always
but generally. Even on a college campus an
ability to write poems or music is worth
something. Ili Grinnell it is actually worth
money. '

Ten years ago 21 Grilluell alumnus died
and left a part of his estate to be a perman-
ent fund from the interest on which were
to be given every year prizes to Grinnell
students who wrote good poetr The prizes
are large. The first is $120; the second is
$80; and the third $40.

Few of the big magazines reward poetry
so well. Not only is the poet paid if he wins
21 prize; his poetry is judged, according to
the terms of the bequest, by a nationally
known poet. Last year this judge was Allen
Tate, the southern poet and novelist. There
are besides two other judges, a member of
the Grinnell English department and a Grin-
nell alumnusi The Selden L, Whitcomb
Poetry Prize is worth competing for.

Through the generosity of Dr. Steiner
prizes are given evely year to students ill
other forms of creative work. This year
prizes will be offered for the best short
story, for the best one act play, and for
the best musical composition.

Not everyone can write a poem or a
play. It is just as well; poets alld play-
wrights must have someone to listen to
them. i
_ At Grillnell there is even a prize for be-
ing a good listener. To the senior who has
ill his four years collected the best personal
library is awarded the Harry Worth prize.
This is partly a money prize, but it is not
only a money prize. Two large publishing
companies. E. P. Dutton and Random House,
reward the winner by giving him his choice
of certain books from their lists.

_ This prize is for seniors oilly, but anyone
in the college can compete for the others.
More should compete than have ill the past.

ALONE

B’l/ Richard E. Byrd.
Perhaps the highest compliment
one can pay a hook is to reread
it almost immediately, and the
next highest to rush to the li-
brary shelves in Search of othErs
by the same author. Both of these
compliments 1 had paid ”Alone,”

While preparing his second ex-
pedition to the Antarctic for id.
Winter at Little America. Byrd
conceived the idea of establishing
another weather base in the in-
,terlor in order that records might
lbs correlated. _

Whoever manned this base must
occupy it during the whole Ant-
arctic winter from March to SEps
temller, when darkness prohibits
travel Byrd elected himSEIf, antir
crpating the months of isolation
with no reluctance, desiring as he
put it. to “sink roots into some
replenishing philosophy.”

For two months all went cums
pal‘atively well: quiEt and solitude
were grateful to him; reasonable
,ooiufort was possible since
“against cold the explorer has
simple but ample defenses
(though against darkness, nothing
but his own dignity).

Radio communication with Lit-
tle Amelica kept him in touch
with frlEuds: almost hourly at-
tention to weather-recording inc
struments and the writing of a
voluminous diary filled his time
with useful occupations.

And then he was ViSlted by
,catastrophe. Poisoned by gas, he
became desperately, almost fatal-
ly ill. How suspicion of his plight
'developed at Little America and
grew into such alarm that a res»
cue party set out by tractor into
the darkness, how the party was
twice turned back (once by motor
trouble and once by a blizzard m
a temperature of -60 degrees),
how it finally reached him and
what happened then, conclude a
story to suit the most exacting
reader of adventure.

SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1939

But in its poignant record of
human suffering, written out of
a ietioencc which believes that
“a man’s hurt is most scemiy
when concealed," and in the wis-
dom that grew from it, is its
most satisfying significance.

Inviting our own contemplation
in this: “The ones who survive
with a measure of happiness are
those who can live profoundly
off their intellectual resources.”

No doubt the final compliment
to a book is the enthusiastic re-
commendation that others read it
also. This one I likewise pay.
