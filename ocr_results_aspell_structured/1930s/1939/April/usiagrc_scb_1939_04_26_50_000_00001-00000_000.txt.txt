iDate discussion after an eve-
ning away from tho study desk
began to take up too much time
for industrious Radcliffe college
women, so they’ve come up with
a new-fangled time—saving system
that deserves a place in the book
of famous inventions.

This new “date reporting” sy-
stem was dcvised, the girls say,
because they "simply must report
the salient features of dates if
they expect to share the big mo-
ments of their dormitory pals."

Telling the story to all of a
girl's friends takes up a good
part of a college girl's morning,

Here's how it works- When wo-
men of Radcliffe retui to their
dormitories in the evening, they

different colored pencils and a
chart which tells them which Cal~

the student Council, are sponsor-

which will be distributed in all
halls and cottages tomorrow
night.

According to the committee in
charge, the questionnaire is not
pointing toward any alteration in
the present system of conducting
examinations, or asking for spe—

is being distributed mainly to dis
cover what the student attitude
toward the question is, and to
stimulate a thoughtful discussion
of the problem on the campus.

Purple is tops. A report written
in purple means that the eve-
