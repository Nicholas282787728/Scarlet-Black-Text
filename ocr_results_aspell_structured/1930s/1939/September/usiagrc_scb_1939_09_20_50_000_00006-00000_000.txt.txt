One Male Halts
A Female Horde
At Dining Room

By Nancy McMurray.

Sevenrflfteen and three bells
flickered and went out. A hungry
horde of feminine intuition surged
down the stairs, through the cor»
ridors, up the loggia. Mining
around the dining room doors,
the crowd jostled for the best
position. Shapely legs tense,
lovely hacks arched, the modern
Grihnell co-eds, complete with
make-up, curls, and all strings
tied, for that first impression,
glued their eyes on the crack be—
tween the promising portals and
waited. It was time for the first
breakfast of the year.

As Cap’n Wczesny of the com»
missary department appeared in
the doorway, the girls leaped for-
ward, and momentarily, the cap-
tain was lost from sight. But the!
never-to-he-daunted w c z e s n y
came up with a smile and an-
nounced, ”Breakfast is at 7:30."

Gnashings of, teeth and grum»
biings filled the air. Upperclass
transfers, staggered at the
thought of fifteen minutes of

 

lost sleep, sank in despair on
the drawing room sofas. The
freshmen, still fresh and unjaded
by experience, stilled the inter,
nal rumbles and retired to the

cloak room fountain. The league
hoard smiled as usual. Upset by
this unstrategi'c order of affairs,
the commissary crew compromised
and the doors opened—7:29 a. in.
