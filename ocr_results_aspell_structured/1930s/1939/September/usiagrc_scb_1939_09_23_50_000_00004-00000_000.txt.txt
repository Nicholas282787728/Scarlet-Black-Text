the opening number of the cur-
rent music series. It is perhaps‘
fitting [hut the first course on
this year's menu should be, as it
were, an assortment of hots
(l'oeuvres. That is precisely what
last night’s entertainment of-
fered: an impressive variety of
small, colorful appetizers, to
whet the appetite and to tickle
the palate. There was the usualI
odd combination to add piquancy,l
“Carmen" startlingly mixed with
“ll Trovatore,” some disguisesl
to conceal the true nature of the
ingredients, a few foreign impor-
tations; and on the whole, the
fore included nothing very heavy.
However, if one is expecting
to make his whole meal of hors
d'oeuvres (the comparison can go
on endlessly). one looks aroundl
far a few more substantial tid-
bits. So last night 1 early had.
my eye on the Handel, Haydn,
and Mozart items. These particu-
lar morsels were never served to
us; you may judge whether that
is evidence of the host's inability
to produce them or of his low
opinion of his guests‘ taste.

Perhaps this is caviling at in-
conseouentialities; certainly. to
judge from the applause. "a good
time was had by all." The party
was a huge success, and hors
d’oeuvres are supposed to be
merely the beginning. They are
not expected to stick to one's
ribs; no doubt the future wlll‘
bring more nourishing and satis-
fying food to the music lovers of
Grinnell.

Langan Music Continues

Despite Record Mystery

The disappearance of 30 records
from Langan ball during the sum-
mer will not in any way affect the
quality of musical entertainment
at open houses in that dormitory,

Music. Finck declared, will be
provided by the six records re—
covered, supplemented by new
purchases by the hall and by the
private record libraries of the
residents.

Zumwalt Cops

Cigar Contest
Chevrolet Car

By William Buckley.
Have you seen that new

Master Deluxe Chevrolet, com-
plete with everything except
white side—wall tires, that has
been traveling around the streets
of Grinnell [without the permisr
sion of Dean Shelton L. Beatty)?

The owner of that car, my
friends, is no one else but your
pal and mine, Elmer Zumwalt,
chief concierge of the Alumni
Recitation hall, who won the car
in a contest sponsored by the
Roi-Tan cigar company. Said El-
mer, "Say, was I surprised! Ev—
eryone was. I guess."

“Take me long to think it up?"
continued Elmer. “Naw.. I wrote
it in about fifteen seconds.
Kinda came to me spontaneous
like."

The contest itself was one in
which the contestant was to
write in 25 words or less the rea-
sons that Roi»Tans are the best
