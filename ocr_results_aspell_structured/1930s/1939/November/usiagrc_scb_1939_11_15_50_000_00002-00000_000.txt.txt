OUR FOOTBALL TEAM

(The following is an excerpt from the Gui-men
Heraldrkegister Thursday, Nova 9.)

"Down at Iowa University, where there
is a great football team which has done
great things this your, there is a group of
football players who play sixty-minute foot-
ball in every game. There is only one rect—
son why they can do this and that is that
thcy cure enough for themselves and their
team and their school to keep in shape, They
are not hurt so much because cplaycr who is
in condition is much less liable to injury
than one who isn’t,

“We never thought that the day would
come when we would hold up an Iowa foot-
ball team as an example to Grinnell, but
that is exactly what we (we doing. We have
an idea that if the spirit which animates
the I own team this your had been in evidence
on Ward field, we would have seen less of
the second half collapses which have dis-
heartened many loyal supporters of the
Grinnoll College football team,

“The coaches can't (lo anything about
this. It is a matter for the players them-
selves to remedy. and until the players them-
selves snap out of it and place the honor of
their school and ,_thc prestige of their team
above their all illdnlyences, we don’t look
to See many victory days on the Gi-innell
campus.”

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

That’s the charge. We print ii: for what
it's worth and for the thought it may pro»
vokc, not because We believe or deny its in-
herent truth. Frankly, we don’t know what
is the principal cause of the season’s record,
Opinions among loose~tongued grandstand
quarterbacks and serious-minded people dis-
turbed by performance of the team range
from the absurd to the fantastic, covering
all of the ground of possible truth in be-
tween.

Cei oinly when one looks at the Beloit,
Simpson, and Carleton games, he wonders,
and more—he howls. And yet, when he
considers the Drake game, the Monmouth
contest, and lust Saturday’s meeting with
\Vdsllhni'n, the Pioneers deserve nothing but
praise. A1. Monmouth, the team came from
behind to score 14 points in the last hall
and win, 1, 7. At Drake, the Pioneers held
d hi lily ton Bulldog eleven to one touch-
down ill three periods, finally losing, 13-0.
At Waslibtilii inst week the injul; iddlcd
Pioneers showed CXL llcnt spin and grime-
lless in standing OIl’ it far more powerful
lchnbod squad.

Ally number of accusations may be level—
ed at a losinv' team, and at times such cr
clsm is jllsllfcd. On the other hand it is
well to remember that Gl'lnllell, like Chi-
cago, still plays amateur football, and pick-
ings are lean for the few strictly amateur
teams remaining in competition.

RELIGION AND MO0NSHINE

It could have happened on our own campus, and
it did happen in a. college discussion group. A
student coui-teously told Dr. Luccock exactly what
he thought of religion.

“I hope you won't mind," he said, “if I say that
religion is all moonsluu I"

“No, I wouldn't mind it at all," Dr. Luccock
replied, and then he added, “But I would like to
thank you for that word.” He remembered, he
tells us, a Mai scene in “The Merchant of Venice"
in which a character kept dancing around the
room, exclaimiiig, “on wise young man, I thank
thce fol‘ that word!”

Next, said Dr. Luccock, I asked the young man
if he had ever been in Panama.

“‘No,” was the answer, “but what has Panama
got to do with religion?"

“There's a lot of moonshine in Panama, Have
you ever seen a twcnty-two root tide come in?
They have them in Panama. If you've never seen
a twentyrtwo foot tide, you've missed something
worth watching. There's an unbelievable lift of
billions of tons of writer, and what’s doing 1L7
Moonshine! The pull of another world but lesistr
less in its force.”

Perhaps we still think that religion isiwcllﬁ
Just so much you know what. But we have our
hats off to a gentleman who can turn our words
into a powei-tul illustration of what no means. We
know, too, that such a gentleman is not a deluded
fanatic, out a hal'drthinking man who dopcs ideas
out intelligently.

With that fact in mind, we're intending to 1157
ton intently to his last two lectures. We can
evaluate what he has Lo say, and maybe dope out
some ideas of our own, Maybe this rcligioii busi-
ness is moonshine
