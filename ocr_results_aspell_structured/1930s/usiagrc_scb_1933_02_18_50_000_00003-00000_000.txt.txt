Ward field, battleground for Pio-
neer heroes of gridiron and cinder
track for more than a third of a cen-
tury, was originally established in the
fall of 1892 from funds provided by
the class of 1393. Various improve-
ments and innovations have been
made from time to time.

As a result of a petition made in
the rail of 1897 by officers of the
class of '03, the field was named in
honor of Herbert c, Ward, of tho
class of 1390. ,

Noted for Chm-actor

While at .Grinnell, Mr. Ward was
one of the school's leading athletes in
each of several branches of sport, but
was still more noted for his qualities
of sportsmanship and character. He
was also secretary of the Young
Men's Christian association while
here.

Varsity athletics were not organ~
ized to any great degree, but inter-
class sports were well developed, ‘and

The national iootbau rules con]-
mittee uuide two minor changes in
the giidiron sport when they met
last week. Both changes, however,
iii-o destined to help the game. both
from the standpoint of the spectator
and from the standpoint oi the play-
er.

a a

First, the committee introduced a
10-yard sideline zone, 10 yards from

each sideline, in which no play shall‘

be started. That is, any time the
ball comes to rest within these zones.
it shall be moved out to the 10-yard
point, and put in play there. This is
designed to eliminate useless wasting
of plays in order to get more strateg-
ic position on the field. Although de»
tracting from ‘the strategy of the
game, the new rule will aid in male
ing the game lively for spectators

The second rlile This to do with

drawn a . yard penalty- in the post,
and because or thc severity of the
penalty, ofﬁcials Illwe not chiorced
the rule strictly. Consequently, the
penalty is reduced to 15 yards, but
with the added stipulation that no
player not having the bnu in his por
session shall be run into lrom behind,

has to be a diﬁ'erent kind of
tobacco from that used in
cigarettes...and it has to be
made by an entirely di erént
process . . .

UT in Kentucky, where they have

pretly women, fast horses, and
blue grass, there grows a tobacco called
White Burley. It doesn’t grow anywhere
else in the world.

There is a type of this White Burley
that is best suited for pipe smoking. It
is neither too thick nor too thin. It is
not light and chaﬂ'y; at the same time,
it is not rank or strong. "U. S. Type
31” is the government classiﬁcation
for White Burley.

Since no other pipe tobacco has yet
been found which seems to equal White
Burley, this is what we use in making
Granger Rough Cut.

Next, we use the Wellmau Method,
a famous 1870 method of making pipe
tobacco, to give Granger its ﬁne ﬂavor
and fragrance. Then, too, Granger is
"Rough Cut”— just like they used to
"Whittle” their tobacco off a plug with
a jackvkuife. It smokes cool, lasts longer
and never gums a pipe.

And ﬁnally, we want to sell Granger
for 10 cents. Good tobacco—right pro-
cess—cut right. So we put Granger in
a sensible soft foil pouch instead of an
expensive package, knowing that a man
can’t smoke the package.

Granger has not been on sale very
long, but it has grown to be a popular
smoke. Folks seem to like it.
