baugh added that we should not
hold our hopes too high because
of the injuries of Barker and
Carmody.

In commenting on the Pioneers'
14 to 14 tie with Colorado, Looks»
baugh stated that the team play-
ed its best game of football this
year. Two hundred yards gained
by rushing, nine completed passes
out of twenty-three attempts, one
going for a touchdown, and an
average of 49 yards for eight
kicks gave Grinnell its most ime
posing array of statistics for the
season. . '
waiters Shines onensirely.

For individual performances
against Colorado, Ed “Ody" wal-
ters was the outstanding offensive
player, according to Lookabaugh.
Walters punted three times for an
average of 59 yard , threw sevs
eral completed passes; and other-
wise did a good job of offensive
playing. Jack Keehn, George Lit-
tle, and Harry Barker also show-
ed well in the backfield. .Captain
Howard Grimes, center; Louie
Gonias, left guard; and Norman
Tschu-ley, right guard, did a great
job defensively. The blocking of
the tackles, John Kennefick, Stan-
ley Zahler, Clair Whitney, Russell
Berg, and Robert Jones, was
largely responsible for the Pine
licers' long runs.

Thday there are about 1,000,000

cigar stores, drug stores, country and grocery stores where
you can buy cigarettes in the United States. These re-
tailers, and the jobbers who serve them, have built up
a service of enurtesy and convenience unmatched by any other
industry catering to the American public’s pleasure.

THERE ARE ANOTHER MILLION people who
are engaged directly or indirectly in the transportation of
cigarettes to every town, hamlet and crossroads.

IT IS ESTIMATED that there are 1,602,000
tobacco farmers raising tobacco in 20 out of the 45
states. Goad tobacco is one of the hardest crops to
raise and bring to market, requiring great .rlzill and
patiencefrnm seed-bedplantingto harvesting andcur-
ing. The modern tobatco farmer has done well thejoh
of constantly impruving the quality of his product.

THE AVERAGE LENGTH of service of the 13,230
people working in the Chesterﬁeld factories, storage
houses, leaf-handling and redrying plants is over 10
years. This means that every step in the making of
Chesterﬁelds, regardless of how small, is handled by peo-
ple who have had 10 years of experience and ability in
knowing their jobs.

TRULY TOBACCO OPENS DOORS to ﬁelds where
people live, work and achieve, and Chesterﬁeld takes
pride in its ever increasing part in this great industry that
is devoted entirely to the pleasure of the American public.

TO SMO K ERS. Chesteiﬁeld Cigarettes have
always said, andnow repeat, that in no other cigarette
made canyauﬁndthe same degree nfrealmildnessand
gaod taste, or the same high qualily ofpraperly cured
and aged tobaccos. Chesterﬁeld Cigarettes are made
wilh one purpose anly. ..to give smokers everywhere
