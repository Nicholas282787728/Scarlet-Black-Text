Professor Canard Relates

Experiences Gained

(By Frances Hanson)

War-spirit and hatred among
European nations are fostered by
the still existing ruins of old (1257
tles and the celebration of ancient
victories stated Henry S. Conard.
professor of botany. who was the
omcial representative of the Eco»

Sixth International Botany con»
grass in Amsterdam, Holland.
Sept. 1 to 7r Mlss Louisa Sargent.
assistant pmfessor of homny. and
Miss Inez Henely, reference librar-
ian, were also members or the
party.

Dr. Conard cited an example of
a holiday in Ireland celebratinga
victory which took place over 200
years ago. “It is as foolish as if
the Northern states here were to
celebrate their victory in the Civil
war," he said. “There is as much
bitterness now as there was in
Cromwell's time," he stated.
“mostly because people grow up
with hatred for old enemies always
lrept before them."

Authority oil-Writes- Lilies

A visit with a London “bobby"
who is an eminent authority on
water-lilies, was one of the most
interesting events of their vacate
tion.

Dr. Consrd also described a hot-
anlzing trip through the Killarney
Lakes region of Ireland. He de-
scribed the position of the Irish
people as “impoverished." but
Miss Sargent quoted an Irishworn.
an as saying. “There is no pover-
ty in Ixelamiieverybody has some.
thing to eat and something to
wear."

Vislt Austrian Village

The party spent a weelr in a
small Austrian village visiting a
colleague of Dr. Consrd's with
whom he has corresponded since
the war. but whom he had never
met Miss Sargent and Min Hone-
ly were the first American women
ever to visit that village.

“There is opinion in Europe that
if ever Italy is preoccupied in
Abyssinia. Germany and Austria
will be united, but not without
much bloodshed from the clash be-
tween the German Nazis and the
Austrian Jews," Dr. Conard doe
clsred. Miss Sargent added that
there is feeling among the Austri-
ans that they should he united

Astrltl's Death is Great Shock

The death of Queen Astrid ol
Belgium was a shock to all
Europe. Miss Sargent said, She
heard the funeral services over a
radio while in a deltt»ware shop in
Amsterdam. “All Dutch flags were
at half—mast for two days in sym-
pathy for Belgium." she added.

Drr Conard's most interesting
experiences were in connection

per st the Moraga institution.

In the leading editorial in its
current issue, Editor Philip Quitt-
msn calls the idea “absurd" in no
uncertain words.

f‘We chose St, Mary's because
we wanted to go to a man's col-
lege. And we still prefer to go
to is man's College! There are am~
pie oc-educstional facilities in the
immediate region for those who
must constantly be with the weak

must have ‘Company.’ transfers to

Quittman called St. Mary's “the
last real stronghold of masculinity
in the region." Authorities of the
college are sounding out sentiment
on the proposed admittance of
