Tie Nebraska

Jones, Kent Capture Singles
and Doubles Monday

in Des Moines.

Special Dispatch.

DES MOINES iGrinnell and Neb-
raska split a six-match tennis series,
3 to a, Monday afternoon on the Des
Moines Golf and Country club courts.
The meet had been scheduled for
Grinnell, but was transferred here be-
cause of the soggy condition of the
Pioneer courts.

Capt. Donald Jones, star Pioneer
performer. turned back Paul Ma-
hood, University of Nebraska ace and
former Nebraska state champion, in
a hard fought battle, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5.
It was a battle of Mahood’s vicious
chop strokes against Jones‘ deep
court driving, Saturday, Manood de-
reated Robins of Iowa state, who
has conquered Jones twice this sea-
son.

The second singles match proved
easy for Kent of Grinnell. who romp-
ed through to a straight set victory
over Elliott of Nebraska. The De-
Long brothers did not ﬁnd things so
easy and both of them went down
under the incessant baseline bom-
bardment of the Nebraska players.
Robert DeLong lost to Sherman in
third singles, while Carnerson was
Charles DeLong’s conqueror.

In ﬁrst doubles, Jones and Kent
again came out victorious, 'winning
over the Nebraska duo with little dif-
ﬁculty. The two-man net attack of
the Pioneer combination was in-
penetrable.

With Grinnell leading 3 to 2 in
matches, it remained only for the De-
Long brothers to win their doubles
to clinch the meet for the Pioneers.
They put in a valiant bid for the
match that would have meant a
Grlnnell victory, but fell short after
forcing the Husker team to three
sets. The Pioneer outﬁt won the sec-
ond set, 6-0, after losing the ﬁrst and
seemed headed for victory, but the
Nebraska team stopped them dead
in the dual set, winning; 64.

Jones, Grinnell, defeated Mahood,
Nebraska, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5.

Kent, Grinnell, defeated Elliott
Nebraska, 64, 6-4.

urges that all teams play off
matches as soon as possible in order

Faculty Decision

The proposal to add a two dollar
dance charge to the semester fee,
which was approved some time ago
by the council of house chairmen, has
been agreed to by the student coun-
cil, and now awaits the verdict of
the dean of women and the faculty
social committee. If these ﬁnd the
proposition desirable, the board of
trustees will be given the opportunity
of expressing the ﬁnal judgment.

“This plan invites the co-operation
of all students, by assessing each one
two dollars each semester.” said Ro-
bert Stevenson, present recreation
committee chairman, when asked
why the scheme is advocated. “This
two dollars a semester will admit to
twenty varsities and Six formal: dur-
ing the year. There are plans for
including bridge parties, roller skat-
ing parties, and other forms of
amusement."

It is doubtful what will become ot
the plan at the hands of those who
must yet pass on it. The trustees re-
jected it when it was presented a year
ago, but it enjoys the support of the
dean of men this time.

A SUGGESTION .
ARE you wise? Have your

ibut a better exam will be
the result of repaired
specs? Just let ROBI-
SON AND MARVIN,
JEWELERS, do your work.
By the way, how about hav-
ing that broken crystal re-
