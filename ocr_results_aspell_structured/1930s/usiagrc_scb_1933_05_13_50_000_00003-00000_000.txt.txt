MUSIC NOTES: A large and en-
thusiustic audience turned out to
the Monday evening diiuier at the
dorms to hear Mr. Mark Trumbull
in he first public appearance of
this semester. Mr. Trumbull’s lyric
soprano was particularly effective
in the rendition of “Announcement
in Honor G.“ His short program
also included many other announce-

menls, etc.

It secms that the public relations
department has been busy of late
trying to entice prospective students
to this greatvarena of intellectual
beauty. Among the literature sent
out was a glowing description of the
living quarters here which described
in detail the hot and coldrunning
water, desks, chairs and the com-
modicus windows and thereby hangs

a story. whoever typed the letters in-

advertantly left the N out of window

in which the writer naively wished

to know how the college expected him
to pay his board and room and sup-
port a widow at the same time.

Grinnell College Orchestra Presents
Concert of European “Popular” Music

Pierce Directs Musicians

in Se’ccnd Program
This Season

B5 Il'lnll. Cooper \

Music lovers of this community
were privileged to hear one of thc
finest concerts of tlic season by a
campus organization when the Grim
ncll collcge orchestra presented its
second program this ycar, Thursday
evening in Herrick chapel. Prof.
Georgc L. Pierce, director, guided
his organization with a high degree
of skill that comes only with many
years of experience.

Schubert's Unfinished Symphony
in the movements Allegro moderate
and Andante con moto was one of
the outstanding numbers on the pro-
gram, bcing especially popular with
the audience because of the exquis-
ite melody of thc allegro movement
that is so well known and loved by
all.

Rhythmic Hungarian Dances

The two Hungarian dances by
Brahms that followed, offered a
marked contrast to the Schubert
Symphony by their fluctuation in
tempo, their rhythmic passages, and
the library in interpretation which
always accompanies selections of
this type.

A soft flowing melody led by the
French horns that became more bom-
bastic as it approached the brilliant
finale characterized Weber's overture
to “Oberon.” The gay, carnival style
of Johann Strauss that makes one
want to laugh and dance and sing
again presented itself in the overture
to “E‘ledermaus.”

Program Perfectly Transmitted

Muted strings and wnodwinds com—
prised the ensemble which played 3.
fairy-like composition by Erichs,
Stiefmutterchen, while Jaernefcldt's
Praeludium evoked considerable adr
miration for its execution. The title,
Adagio Pathetique, aptly character-
izes the composition by Godard. The
fantastic Funeral March of a Marionr
ette by Gounod was played as an en-
care.

It is difficult to say at what par-
ticular point this program reached
its climax or which one of the num-

bers was most outstanding. The on-
tirc program was so perfectly trans
inlttcd.

The concert isprobably rpiitc coin-
parublo to the “popular” concerts in
Europe where Lhc best music is very
well known and consequently grcatly
iovcd, as contrnstcd to our definition
of the term which includes modern
jazz under the hcading of "populdl‘."
it is to bc licpcd that concerts of
a similar nature will follow this one.
and thus “popularize" good music in
America.

Will‘EngrQe '
Hall Trophies

Council to Help Determine
Reading Period Rules

Purchase of intramural trophies
this ycar will include the cost of en-
graving, so that the winning halls
will not be subject to additional ex-
pense, it was decided Thursday ever
ning by the council of house presi-
dents.

The trophies are made possible this
year by the cooperation of the men’s
halls and the council with the ath-
letic department, which has previous-
ly made the awards unassisted.

Ask Return of Silverware

A reminder that books due at the
beginning of the first period are not
subject to fines if placed in the der
posit box on the front steps of the li-
brary before it opens in the morning
will be made at the next house meet-
ings.

Further cooperation in returning
cf silverware to the men's dining
room was requested. Floyd Horton
was appointed to confer with the
supervisor of the dining room and
make definite plans for its recovery.

Reading Period Rides

Robinson Shoulberg was appointed
to attend the meeting of the special
committee on social events, compos-
ed of representatives of the house
council, Womens Self Government
league. and the administration, which

 

will determine the rules to apply dur-

ing the coming reading period.

At the request of balls located
near the kittenball courts, men will
be asked to refrain from playing
baseball directly in front of the
dormitories, in order to avoid brcak-
age.

A request to Mr. Phelps that addi-
tional work bc done on the baseball
diamond will also be made.
