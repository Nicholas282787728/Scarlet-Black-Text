It was a long ride homc from Des

couldn't be accused of imitation.

only man on the team that hadn'ti

However, he is the leading scorer-
in the conference, and coaches
hall him as the classiest center
in the league by a considerable
margin. watch him Monday night
and you’ll get an cycfull. At the
forwards, our choices were Jesse
Renick, the smooth Indian from
the championship Aggies. and
Paul Griffith the leading star of
Drake's five “iron man.” )
neiiick was the only man on the

use around the basket to speak
for his ability to hold a place on

Loiiipi-ich of Tulsa and our own
Bob Berry took the honors in
those positions.

iiieil the nui-i-uines
at mid year but he made them
into a real boll chili with his
sparkling play nis combined of-
fensive and defensive ability last
Thursday was quite the best we
had seen by any guard all year,
Some people might accuse us of
piepidiee in selecting Berry for
the team, untl the fact is, he
probably won‘t be placed on any
all conference teams. This is be-
cause his play is not reflected in
the scoring column. But with the
qualities of real leadership and
uncoiiiiy defensive ability, we bee

live the pi _ er captain rates re-

them into a final pass to just

finally, how he’ll go up in the air

without fouling, is quite the neat-
