JOTS DOWN A FE“! NOTES. (Oh,

yeah?) There were a few tine niixupsl

in Dihhle cluhrocm Monday night at
the open house, perhaps due in part
to the general astonishment oi an
open house on a school night , . i
For instance, Gene Wood appearc
with the girl that Dave Malln-ougli
has been dating pretty constantly
lately . . . . Then again

loopers but maybe it’s just because
Chisholm had gone home, or had she 7
And then of course there were Lnu
Van Nostrand and Ha -iet Sokol,
which is one of the ﬁrst times on rear
ord that Lou has stepped out of the
fold and are the girls glad . . . . And
did you know that McClintocli and
Caldwell have a terrific case which is
quite ohvious to even the dullest on
observation, particularly at an open
house?

We'll give you three guesses who
the housemother was who made the
remark that girls‘ smoking was
like "mixing the juice o1 tohaoeo

showed up with one of the Hicken-

and the pollen oi lovely ﬂowers."
We hate to take exception to such
a poetic phraseology and we‘ll ad-
init the tohncco juice, but the line
will have to he drnwu on that lore—
ly ilower shift In case you're puz—
zled, here's another clue—she liies

her cottage go ninth (or the rile

The years in the oricue have tlc-
strayed Miss Mayhew's regard for
mere campus personagcs. The other
day when Betsy Compton signed out
tor council Bluffs, where she was
going to visit Jock Moxtield, Miss
Mayliew qllotll: “Who is this Maxfield
'pel'san?” or course, there was no on-
‘swer. “He's just one of the boys”
would have answered as well as any.

The scene was the salesmanship
close. rrcscnt were an immense as-
sortment of students and the two
principnls, Mr. Norris rind Helen
Rider:

Mr. Nor “Now speaking or
salesmen of both sexes, would you
soy they were born or made, Miss
Rider?"

Miss Rider: (in her most chann—
ing manner). “on, crerythingls
made these days and 1 don’t sup-
posc salesmen are any exception."
We can‘t: help thinking tluit some
crack ahout mass production would
hare really cupped the climzn' but
you can't have everything in one
day
