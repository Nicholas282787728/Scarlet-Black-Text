Two traditional iootball enemies,
both at whom are seeking their first

the Drake gridiron Friday evening.

No one can saiely predict the out—

A review oi the Homecoming game
here Saturday shows that Grinnell
passes were ineiiective because oi

paralyzed because oi lack oi blocking
and timing; that the interierencc ior
the ball—carrier pulled out so slowly
that it was a hindrance rather than a
halp; and that on deiense, the Grinnell
line iailed to charge through iast to
break up the oiiense.

it is hoped that many oi these de-
iects‘ will be ironed out beiore Friday

Whyte Explains
Causal Factors
in Chinese Crisis

“The present crisis in the Far East
can not be treated as an isolated in—
cldent in world affairs, but must be
examined in the light oi past history."
declared Sir Frederick Whyte, noted
British authority on Eastern allairs, in
a lecturc given in Herrick chapcl lust
night.

Ml, Whyte, who landed on the
Paciiic coast just eight days ago irom
the Orient, is opening an extended
lecture tour of the United Slates.

When western civilization iirst made
its appearance in the East it was
greeted by entirely dillerent attitudes
on the part of the Chinese and Japan—
ese nations. Whyte explained, China
treated the new ideas with disdain
and attempted to isolate the western»
crs. Japan, at ilrst adopted a similar-
attitude, but later lnodiﬁed its stand
and then rapidly adopted western
ideas

The result was that Japan gained
the status of El modern world power
through the RussoeJapanese war,
while China is still in the process of
becoming modernized, he continued
The resulting disturbances within
China provided Japan with a plam<
ible excuse for intervention in Chin—
ese affairs.

The chaotic conditions in china ex-
isted also in Manchurla and when the
old war lord Chang So Lin, who had
dominated Manchurian affairs, was 357
aassinated in 1928, there began a series
of bandit raids and disturbances which
finally culminated in the Japanese
seizure of Manchurla.

‘Happiness ofNot Arriving’
Topic of Address by Luvell

Cecil r. Lavcll, pioicsscr oi thc
history oi thought, based his Homo—
coming vcspers address Sunday, en.
titled “The Happiness oi Not Airw—
ing," upon the saying oi Christ, “Be
ye pcricct as your Father in heaven is
periect."

He urged that this advice he used
as a program oi progressive fulfill—
incnt rather than as an infinitely re—
mote ideal. “An ideal or creed too
tar away iroin actual living tends to
issue in hard and uniruitiul dogma—
tism," he declared.

Man's supcriority to othcr animals,
Professor Lavell pointed out, is chielc
ly in that he is incomplete and knows
it, and is forever trying to do some-
thing about it,

“Arrival," he concluded,
than being on the way."
