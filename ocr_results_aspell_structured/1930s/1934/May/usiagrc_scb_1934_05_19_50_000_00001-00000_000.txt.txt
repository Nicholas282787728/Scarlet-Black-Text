Aggies ' ead Valley Qualifiers

Places Seven
in Trial Heats

Three Pioneer 440 Entries

Qualify for Finals
This Afternoon

Grinneli qualified seven men in the
preliminaries of the Missouri valley
conference track meet at the Drake
stadium yesterday afternoon, placing
three men in the 44o—yard dash, and
one each in the high and low hurdles
and the 100 and 220-yard dashes.

The Oklahoma Aggies qualified 10
men in the preliminaries, however,

and are favorites to win the meet,
when the finals in all events are held

this afternoon, since they are almost
certain to win four of the field
events. Drake qualified nine men,
Creighton two, and Washington IIni<
versity two.

Pince Three in 440

Anderson, Barnes, and McKlveen
are the three Pioneers who qualified
in the quarter-mile. Anderson was
first in the second heat, covering
the distance in :52.6, while Barnes
and McKlveen placed second and
third in the first heat,

Clark placed second in his heat of
the low hurdles, and third in the
highs, to qualify in two events.
Bentley was second in his heat of the
220-yard dash, and Bair was third in
his heat of the 100.

Records Endangered

Several field records are in danger
of fading when two members of the
Oklahoma A. its M. team go into ac-
tion in the shot and javeiin events,
Carl Rigney, who now holds the con-
ference record of 192.7 feet in the
javelin, has been tossing the spear
around 200 feet consistently this
year, and may be able to break his
own record.

Jim Tichenor is the other probable
record-breaker for the Aggies, Spe-
cializing in the weight events. He
put the shot 49 feet, 7ys inches in a
recent meet, almost two feet better
than the present Valley record held
by Blanck of Drake. Tichenor won
the conference discus event last year.

Pioneers Threaten Mark

Grinncll placed third in last year's
meet, which was won by Drake. The
Oklahoma Aggies were second, But»

icr was fourth, and Creighton Was‘

fifth. Grinnell has placed above
Drake in two outdoor meets this year,
and should be able to repeat today.
The Oklahoma Aggies will return
with a strong team, however.

drawing from the conference, will not‘

Production Requires Polish

Before Last Presentation,

Asserts Faculty Critic

By H. w. MATLACK

Commencement visitors will enjoy
an exceptionally fine play when they
see Sierl-a’s “Romantic Young Lady,"
given a preview last night before a
largo audience which became more
and more enthusiastic as the play
went on. Manifestly unfinished as
yet, the production gives every promc
ise of attaining the high standard of
perfection relentlessly pursued by
Mrs. Pryor and her classes.

Last night it got off to a poor
start because the players were ape
pareotly nervous in the opening
scene, and they fussed and cliattered
and hustled each other around so that
instead of the background of a gen-
tcei and dignified, if somewhat im-
poverished old Spanish establishment,
on which the play is built, we got the
impression of a not too refined house.
party Slcrl‘a’s language is that of
exquisite refinement, and his wit is as
delicate as the point of a rapier.
thn it is laid on with a club, with
the antics of farce, not only the lan—
guage but the meaning of the play
disappears. .

Happily when Collison made his un-

 

 

IPreview of ‘Comedy Gives Promise
of Fine Commencement Entertainment;

CDnVenthllalil-Ol' a Spanial‘di on-
trance through the big window. the
atmosphere of the play at once
gained the altitudc of high comedy,
and this happened every time he
came into a scene. All the charac-
ters seemed to take the key from
Collison, and became suave, witty,
and discreet, instead of jumping
around and making faces. In this re.
spect, more than any other, the cast
has an opportunity to find itself in'
the next two or three weeks.

Next to Collison in accurate inter»
pretation were Irma Cooper, as the
faithful and impudcnt old family
houselteeper~how perfect she was!7
and Louise Smith as the ultra-mod-
ern secretary with both her eyes
open. In spite of little to say, Manricc
Birdsaii as tho all-knowing servant,
Randall Klemmc as Medina, and Eve-
lyn James as Collinson‘s tcrpsichor-
eon psi, made tncir parts completely
real.

Truly Trousdale, the heroine, was
perfect in the last act, and in it she
realized again how wcli she can bane
die a ficult part. But it took her a
long time to get into it. In the first
two acts she was more like a sour
brcttc than a prinia donna. Perhaps
it was the uncouth actions of her
three brothers, not the least like
Spanish dons, that made her keep
fidgeting and making faces But
when she can be so much the gentle-

Rawson won over Dibble s to 2
Wednesday, the Dibble nine collect-

Seven Entries

Lamb, Newton, Leads Field
in Both Hurdle Events,

Javelin Throw

Floyd DeHeer of Oskaloosa lived

up to expectations in the prelimi—

naries of the state high school track
meet this morning by tossing the shot

h to a new record of 54 feet, 6 3-18

inches, bettering the previous mark
established in 1931 by Earl of North
High, Des Moines, by almost Six feet.

DeHeer also led the field of discus
qualifiers with a throw of 125.29 feet.

Most versatile of the qualifie‘rs was
Bush Lamb of Newton, who won his
heats in both high and low hurdle
events and made the best javelin
throw to qualify in three events. His

' javciin mark of 168 feet, 10 1-8 inches

was about seven feet better than the
winning throw of last year, but was
still 17 feet short of the record.

Robinson of North High, Des
Moines, led the dash men by winning
his beats in both the 100 and the 220.
Cretzmeyer of Algona and Saggau of
Denison, both of whom won the loo-
yard dash in their district meets in
the fast time of :09.8, were unable to
duplicate their [eats this morning.
In the century Cretzmeyer was dis-
qualified for jumping-the gun, and
Saggau barely got into the finals by
tying for third in a heat which went
in :lo.4.
Others Place Twice

Other men who qualified in more
than one event were Dillon of 0s-
haloosa, in the shot put and javelin;
Eicheriy of Holstein in the shot put
and the 220: Avise Roosevelt in the
100 and 220eyard dashes; and Mo»
Kinley of Clinton in the high and
low hurdles.

Kinch of Washington High, Cedar
Rapids, was another man who led
the qualifiers in two events. His
time of :ld.4 in the low hurdles was
the fastest on the track this morn-
ing, and his mark of 20 feet, 91/,
inches in the broad jump gave him ,
the lead on the qualifiers in that
event.

Qulilifies Seven

Washington High of Cedar Rapids
led in the number of qualifiers, with
seven men eligible to compete this
afternoon in the events for which
preliminaries were held. Oskaloosa
had four qualifiers, and North High
of Des Moines, ottumwa, Newton,
and Clinton each placed three men.

Fort Dodge is represented by the
largest squad at the meet today, with
eleven men entered. Denison has
nine men entered, and teams of eight
men each have been entered by
