WHO’S- GOING TO ACT?

At the risk of drawing criticism upon our
selves for “harping" too much upon the subject,
we wish to discuss the pending action on prep-
ping. A number of students have expressed the
feeling that too much is being made of the situa»
tion and that undue importance is being attached
to it.

That the administration is justified in taking
the matter so seriously is obvious if one stops to
consider the predicaments in which the powers-
that-be annually find themselves following ”hell
week.” While it seems unimportant to the aver~
age collegian that a number of mxen were required
to‘ enter private rooms in the quadrangle during
their early morning escapades, they fail to realize
the difficulty involved in passing off the incident
to the satisfaction of a couple of irate parents.
Neither do they appreciate how seriously it may
harm the college if a prep is seriously injured as
a result of the probation period ”discipline.”
While no really serious injuries have yet resulted,
they have been threatened a number ofytimes,
and it is obvious that retention of paddling as a
part of the “hell week" activities is unwise; not
only from the point of the freshmen‘s welfare,
but that of the college as well.

As Dean Beatty explained last year in refus-
ing the continuance this fall of the annual “class
scrap,” it is the college officials who have to pla-
cate enraged or frightened parents-not the stu-
dents. It is very unfair to the former to retain
a custom which threatens twice a year to place
them in such highly embarrassing positions.

Yesterday the administration committee of
the college met to discuss the question of prep—
ping, but action was deferred because the mem»
bei's feared that if they took steps at that time
they would be too extreme in their restrictions,
On Friday the student council will meet to discuss
the same matter. If they are as fair as the col-
lege officials, a modified “hell week” may very
possibly be retained. Modification is certain to
come, and the student government can gain much
in dignity and respect if it takes the matter into
its pfwn hands and orders the necessary changes
itse .

There seems to be a very real place for some
sort of a freshman probation period in the col-
legiate scheme. It would be a pity if lack of in-
ititative on the part of the students should neces-
sitate abolishment at Grinnell of “hell week” in
every formt But the viciousness and revenge
motive which now play so big a part can be omit-
ted without the true purpose of the custom being
altered.

It is very much to be hoped that' action will
be taken Friday by the student governingboard
which will make further action by the administra—
tlnn unnecessary. The council has much to gain
and little to lose by so doing.

A NEED REVEALED

At the finals of the Merrill debates on Mon-
day evening there was a disappointingly small
audience. Had the founder of the prize competi—
tion been present hc would have been sadly dis-
appointed at the manifest lack of interest in “pr-ac»
tical politics” which the series revealed.

The purpose of the debates is to “stimulate
interest and discussion of questions of practical
politics,” and judging from the student interest
shown there is a decided need for such stimula~
tion or better, perhaps, for creation of such an
interest. Politics today are of greater import»
mice than they have been at any other time in the
history of this country. On every side political
changes are taking place which vitally cfe
lcct everyone; yet the interest in these Chanr
is so apathetic that only a very few attend a dC<

bate which centers around a question dealing with
this subject.

The present college generation is but one
step away from the government of the future.
Iuspitc of this fact the students seem to go blithely
through college heedlcss of thc task before them
and seemingly content to remain ignorant of the

actual state of affairs. The attitude “I don‘t want
to sully my hands with politicsH is all to preval—
ent among modem collegians.

The problem of arousing in the oncoming gen-
eration a sense of responsibility toward the polio
tical problems of the country is not a new one,
but it is becoming an increasingly vital one since
the prevalence of graft and incompetence in the
political organization of recent years has caused
the modern student to look askancc at a political
career.

G. W. Merrill saw the great need for inciting
active interest among the students in the poli-
tical developement of the country. The need he
saw in 1911 is even greater today, and is become
ing truly a serious one if the disinterest of the
Grinnell students is representative of the general
collegiate attitude.

JAPAN SEEKS EQUALITY

Japan is a world power of the first magni-
tude today and she knows it After three weeks
of bickering, the representatives of the United
States and England at the naval conference in
London have arrived at only one conclusionwthat
Japan refuses to abandon her demand for naval
equality. Both England and this country are de»
sirous of keeping the Washington treaty alive and
of maintaining the 5-5-3 ratio, but Japan is not
to be drawn into any such agreement, because
she knows that she is powerful enough to hold
out for equality. If she doesn’t obtain equality
she will withdraw from any attempt at naval
disarmament and go ahead and build up as large
a navy as she can finance.

At the same time England and the United
States have found that Japan does not intend
to retract the new oil monopoly law in Manchu-
kuo nor her policy of bringing the foreign oil in»
dustry in Japan and in her puppet State under
the control of the government.

Neither does Japan intend to cease fortifying
the islands in the southern Pacific, which she
holds by mandate from the League of Nations,
with the obvious intention of using them for naval
bases in the event of war.

Now is the time for some decided action up»
on the part of the United States and England if
they do not want to find themselves swamped in
the wash of Japan’s wave of imperialism. M
has been seen in the past, protests are of no
avail, for the Japanese have a remarkable apti»
tude for getting around them without altering
their course of action. Japan is taking advantage
of. the lack of unity among the western nations
to push her plan for supremacy along at a very
rapid rate. In the interests of maintaining world
peace, a check must be placed on Japan’s bold
program of militarism.

EMINENCE SERVICE?

Many men have received honors under that
all inclusive term “for eminent service”; but few
persons have suspected that the term has been
extended to include services rendered in the pro~
motion and continuance of rampant emotions of
war. Yet, a number of European nations have
honored Sir Basil Zahraoff, munitions salesman
deluxe, “for eminent service,” according to an
account given in two biographies of his life.

Zahraoff has done much to create a bloody
trail of war through Europe and the Near East.
His forte has been the promotion and continu—
ance of wars. How anyone can conceive this as
constituting outstanding service is beyond the
comprehension of most intelligent men. The an~
swer to this paradox lies in the fact that Sir
Basil is one of the cleverest proprogandists that
the world has known. He is the past master of
the art of diseminating false information, as his
success in promoting wars shows.

With this gory record behind him, Zahraoff
has been honored by European nations “for emi»
nent service,” If it is logical to give him the ap»
probation conveyed in the term; then the world
might well adopt the policy of commending the
man who commits homicide. Both are clearly
murderers, although they differ in the legality of
their methods. It is illegal to murder an indivi-
dual man in civilized communities; yet it is not
illegal to kill thousands of men by promoting wars
for profit. This is the reasoning which seems
“Ef lie in back of the honoring of Sir Basil Zahra-
o .

Surely the ideals of the World are in need of
a serious revision when such men as Zahraoff
are tolerated, to say nothing of honored. But on—
1y, when the world realizes the necessity of Con~
demning rather than commending such perpetra»
tors of wholesale murder will Sir Basil and his
like be stamped out.

The public is pusillammous and cowardly, because
it. is weak. It knows itself to be a great dunce, and
that it has no opinions but upon suggestion. Yet it is
unwilling to appear in the leading—strings, and would have
thought that its decisions are as wise as they are weighty.
it is hasty in taking up its favorites, more hasty in laying
thcm aside, lost it should be supposed deficient in sagacity
in either case. It is generally divided into two strong
parties, each of which will allow neither common sense
nor common honesty to the other side—William Hazlitt.

Lcaming and art, and especially religion, weave ties
that make war look like fratricide, as it is. Early in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries . . . the Popes, to their
eternal honor, declared, religious jubilces. during which
all hostilitich were suspended throughout Christendom,
and man had a breathing space.vRalph Waldo Emerson.

A frank and somewhat hoodlum: carriage, not looke
ing too anxiously before, not dallying in maudlin regret
over the past, stamps the man who is well armored for
this world—Robert Louis Stevenson.

By TED KLEIN
Since president Roosevelt has re—
membered the "forgotten man" and
now that, in general, there seems to
he a spirit of harking back to long
neglected values, we think it approe
priate to continue with occasional re»
views of "forgotten periodicals" in the
hope that your frequent perusal of
these journals will justify their exist—
ence in the library. They are to be
found at the southwest corner of the
second floor reading room.

The Journal of Criminal Law and
Criminology is written in an easy nona
technical style to hold the interest
of the reader who is not desirous of
detailed pours of criminal law. It
actually succeeds in making one feel
that perhaps the lawyer is not just a
cold and. efﬁciently-functioning piece
of legal machinery after all. The at-
ticle in the October issue on “The
Criminal Underworld of Chicago in
the ’80s and '90’5” will please those
who endeavor to look at the politico-
criminal alliance realistically,

The Journal of Accountancy. Wal-
ter B. Pitkin in his latest book says
that this is a promising field for a
young man to enter. An article in
the-October issue of this magazine
on “The Future of the C. P. A." by
Charles Weissinger expands on the
subject. It may come as a distinct
shock to many students of business
administration to hear this experienc.
ed executive- advocate the value of a
broad cultural background above all
else. Sidelights like that, which on-
ly experience can bring, illustrate the
value to the student in the reading of
these periodicals.

The Journal oI Modern History. The
number of journals on the subject of
history is legion but the field is so
extensive in its scope that each seems
to fill a particular niche as does this
one. The analysis of “The Genesis of
the Munitions Traffic" by Joseph v.
Fuller keenly scrutinizes in the al.
most brutally concise terms of econ-
omic history the rise of the traffic in
arms with which the world is con
cerncd today.

League of Nations Chronicle. The
fascination of history, said Dr. G. r.
Gooch at Geneva this summer. lies in
the unexpected. A situation may ap—
pear fairly simple, or at least under.
standable. Then suddenly actions that
were unforeseen may change every.
thing and throw all the forces into
new relations. The deaths of King
Alexander of JugoeSlavia and of For.
eign Minister Barthou of France is
one of those events. To realize the
significance of the situation those as-
sassinations creamd one must resort
to commentators on the intemational
scene. You will find the League of
Nations Chronicle contains many ex-
cellent yet briel‘ personal viewpoints
on possible developments.

The name of the Gulf Stream should
he changed to “Caribbean Current."
according to Prof. Albert E. Parr, of
Yale university. His researches have
proved that there is little or no Gulf
of Mexico water in the current.

Failure of Students Caused
by Inability to Use English

ATHENS. Ga, (ACP)7Lack of
knowledge of English words and their
meanings is one of the most serious
causes of student failures at the Uni—

Freshmen of the University of
Georgia were compared with the
freshmen of many other colleges by
means of psychological tests given the
first year students. While in ability
