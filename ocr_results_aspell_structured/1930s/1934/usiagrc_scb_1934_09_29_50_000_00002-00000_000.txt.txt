THE UNDER-DOG

For the last two or three years, the Grinnell
football team has entered the majority of it’s con-
tests the under-dog. In most cases, though, sur~
prising upsets by spirited Pioneer teams of the
past were recalled in pure-game writeups and the
scarlet and black gridders were granted an out»
side chance of tripping even their most highly
touted opponents,

This year, with the memory of Grinnell’s mis—
erable season last year still fresh in the mind’s of
the sport scribes, the Pioneers are not only looks
ed upon as the underdogs, but predictions
point to another season just as disasterous as the
last. “Not to be reckoned with in Valley compel.—
ition,” the dopesters assert, adding, “The Grinncll
team will find considerable difficulty in coping
with even the weakest of its 1934 opponents."

Supporters of the local eleven may feel of
fended with the small consideration given the
team by the so-called experts; in reality the dop-
esters, by their complete disrespect for the Fios
neers are doing them a real favor.

No contest is more difficult to prepare for
than one which is won before it is played. As
Sec Taylor, the well known sports writer, assert-
ed recently, football is a game of spirit even more
than of strength and speed. He cited the recent
game in which a fighting Simpson eleven tied a
stronger but spiritless Drake team 6 to 6 in a
game that was supposed to be a set—up of the
Bulldogs.

Since nothing will act quicker to create over-
confidence in a team than overwhelming agree~
merit of the newspapers as to its superiority over
a reputedly weak foe, the gentlemen of the press
will doubtless be involuntarily aiding the Pioneers
throughout the Season.

\Vhile it is unpleasant to be known as a ”hope-
lessly weak” team, the Grinnell team possesses in
that reputation one of its greatest assets for the
coming campaign; few if any of the Pioneer’s
opponents will point for the Grinnell contest, And
everything considered, there could be lots of
things \v0' than being the under-dog if a team

' ties possessed by the scrappy 1934
Pioneers.

PATRIOTISM, LTD.”
(particular emphasis on “limited”)

The Nye investigation of DuPont reveals
interesting truth about our patriotic munition
firms. Mr. DuPont made an appeal for American
safety by showing the absolute necessity of an
efficient arms industry. The only way to make
this industry powerful enough to protect our con-
tinent is to give large profits to patriotic citizens
who operate it. So Mr. DuPont asserted, adding
that if the government attempts to take over this
industry or seriously curtail its profits, then
American democracy and life will find itself de-
fenseless against the approaching hordes of
Russian communism!

Later in the same day it was revealed that one
source of Du Pont profits was the sale to Russia
of certain information regarding the production
of nitrate. In this way America‘s patriotic muni-
lion industry filled a much needed gap in the war
machine of the Soviet Republic.

There is nothing novel about these Nye
revelations. DuPont does not stand alone in
Supplying foreign powers with war material and
then announcing that America must be prepared
to defend herself against the menace of those same
foreign arms. Nor do American munition firms
stand alone in this nefarious practice. A strike
ing article in the March issue of Fortune care-

fully analyses similar dealings by European arms
makers. It tells of the “brothers de Wendel,"
ardent French nationalists. “Some of the family,"
it goes on, “have been Von Wendels, ardent Ger-
nationalists. Their vast wealth lies in the mines
of Lorraine and the Saar; as national boundaries
change under them, some of them alter the prce
flxcs of their names and go serenely on. " Of
course this, too, is only one small incident of many
revealed in the article, but it is sadly typical of
hundreds.

It is not enough for us to quietly disapprove
of these revelations as they come to us through
the press. Nor is it enough for our Senate to
reprimand munitlon firms and then tell them to
go on about their business. Somehow the profit
must be taken out of war, But government oper—
ation during time of war can never be sufficient.
for mlln'ltion proliteering goes on before and after
war as well. Our job is not to wait for a war and
then take the profit out of it, but to prevent the
profits which build the armies and navies com-
petitively higher until war is inevitable, “Pacifist“
and “Patriot," too often having to stand apart be-
cause they seek peace by different means, should
join .hands here in driving munition manufactures
from their throne. The government should not
only control but own the means of making war
during times of peace and times of war alike.

ADEQUATE CRITICISM

Almost constant Charges of failure to live up
to campaign promises havesbeen hurled at the
administration. That charge}; most recently hurl-
ed by the Republicans but used just as frequently
by the Democrats, seems to be the standard
method of attacking onc’s political opponent.

Criticism by the opposition is expected, for
it plays an important part in the success of a
government; but certainly the vain charge of
failure to keep party platforms is not valid criti-
cism, regardless of whether or not the party hap-
pens to be Republican or Democrat.

The current custom among the political part-
ies seems to be to make pledges merely to break
them. In this respect neither party is in any
position to hurl the charge of failure to live up to
campaign promises. Both the Republican and
Democratic parties have been guilty of failure to
abide by campaign promises so often that. practs
ically no faith can be placed in any of their
pledges.

Take for example the farm question. Both
parties have promised to aid agriculture again
and again but up to the time of the present ad—
ministration nothing was done except throw a
little sop to the farmers in the form of money
payments of various kinds. Again and again the
same thing has taken place on other questions
with always the same result, nothing being done

And yet the mere hurling of the charge of
failure to mpaign promises is considered ad»
equate criti sm in spite of the fact that both
parties have made it a consistent policy to break
their promises.

It would undoubtedly be better for the Collins
try if the party in opposition would attempt to
offer constructive criticism instead of merely
tossing timevworn and phrases to the four winds.
Criticism is necessary and helpful but empty
phrases accomplish nothing.

Other Opinions

MDDNE . MARTY“ 0R MENACE
(Daily Californian)

inflated tabloids, posing under the classification of
“newspapers," are still sclling extra copies of their
infamous sheets by keeping up a continual “Free Tom
Mooney" howliwhich wouldn’t be of any particular
significance if it weren‘t for Upton Sinclair’s announced
intention of pardoning Mooney immediately if and when
he is elected.

Personally, we have managed to keep rather opcn~
minded on this Mooney problem—a delicate situation,
loaded with political dynamite. True, we’ve laughed at
the out»and-out cheap propaganda that has made Mooney
a “martyr" for Labor, Communism and Sinclair. We’ve
occasionally felt that the man was convicted on framed
evidence, But we've tried to remain impartial until we
could learn enough of the case to reach our own cone
clusion, uninf'luenoeol by any sort of propaganda.

During the past six months, we've come in contact
with several San Quentin convicts; we've contacted
various prison and police officials. Everywhere the,
opinion is the same: Mooney is a sullen convict, refusV
ing to cooperate vvith prison officials and with fellow
convicts. He has taken on an air of conceit, and is never
satisfied unless he is forcing prison liberties for himself
that are denied others.

Unbiased legal authorities are generally firm in their
belief that Mooney was convicted on illegal grounds;
but they also agree that the “labor martyr” was actually
guilty, although police stupidly just ”couldn’t pin it on
him." In that light, there is no doubt as to his guilt,
the only question being the method in which he was
convicted. it becomes a problem. not of Justice. but of
Legal Procedure—and there's considerable difference.

"Mooney?" asked one recently paroled San Quentin
convict who visited our office recently. “Prisoners prac-
tically all agree he’s as guilty as they come. But he
knows he’s become a political symbol and has heard so
much ‘martyr stuff” that he's become inwlerant in his
relations with other prisoners. They may not have been
able to get enough evidence to convict him in accordance
with exact feral red tape, but they've got their man.“

When viewed from a coldly uncmotional angle, the
Mooney situation seems something else again, doesn't it?

CHAPEL
NOTES

Dr. E, A, Steiner, professor of ap—
plied Christianity, inlliatcd the new
system of chapel exercises by speaking
the first four days this week.

The patterns left on Dr. Steiner’s
mind by events and experiences of
his life formed the theme of his ad—
dresses. The world war left him with
a horror of all killing and suffering
and a hatred of the unreasoning pride
of race which causes it, the speaker
declared,

Faith in God and man formed a sec—
ond pattern, he continued. "Man is
the result or a creative power, not an

accident,” he stated, His illusionshat—
tereel, man has lost faith in progress,
in democracy, and in himself, Dr.
Steiner explained, And yet, he asscrt»
ed, spiritual man still has the power to
appropriate something of the divine in
himself.

An instinctive love of counti‘y wa,
the third pattern described The
speaker expressed hope for a patriot-
ism that will include the whole of
mankind rather than a single nation.

"Failure to progress,“ he said, in his
concluding talk, “is worse than sen»
