IT‘S KNOCKIN G

”Opportunity knocks but once” the old pros
verb runs. In Spite of this, however, the students
of Grinnell do not seem to appreciate that this
semis opportunity has been knocking at their
individual doors for a month or more.

In this instance opportunity is the all-college
revue which, after being absent from the college
calendar for a number of years, is being revived
in a Slightly different form under the auspices of
Sigma Delta Chi and the National Collegiate
Players.

The revue has been revived with the intens
tion that it should not only offer additional enter-
tainment but an opportunity as well for student
writers to Show their ability and express their
ideas. As a reward, the author or authors who
'write the skits used in the performance will re-
ceive one~third of the net proceed57which con-
stitutes a prize well worth working forr

The rules governing the writing of the skits
are simple. A writer may submit six skits in-
dependently or in conjunction with other writers,
or he may submit a single act. Not only are
individuals eligible to write for the production,
but campus organizations may write as well. The
manuscripts are due Dec. 17 and will be judged
by critics outside of college. Certainly these rules
will not provide any difficulties for the prospec-
tive writers.

Since the rules are so Simple there is no
reason why Grinnell students should not avail
themselves of the chance for a substantial re—
ward. The coming Thanksgiving vacation could
not be spent more profitably than in getting
started on a skit for the revue. Opportunity’s
knocking, but it’s up to you to open the door.

G
NOT THE ANSWER

For many years it was periodically lamented
that the youth of America failed to take the avid
interest in national and world problems exhibit-
ed by young students in st of the European
countries. They were Ci" zed for indifference
and indolence and declared unworthy candidates
for leadership in years to come.

That this collegiate indifference to world
problems is passing is evidenced by the steady
growth of Student interest in such gatherings as
is now in session on the Grinnell camus, in such
groups as the Sunday Evening club and, at other
schools, the League for Industrial Democracy,
Cosmopolitan clubs and similar organizations.

Up to the present, Support and encourage-
ment of such student activity has been consistent
ly offered by the administrations of schools fos-
tering the movements. As airesult, the groups
have become increasingly independent in their
thinking and, unimpeded by faculty censorship,
have discussed and frequently approved, political
and economic experiments which deviate much
from the accepted political and economic move—
ments taught in the institutions.

Until the administration of the University
of California stepped in recently and suppressed
the activity of the Social Relations club on its
campus, no action of note had been taken toward
restricting student activities along this line. A
wave of investigation into similar freesthinking
student organizations swept through California
scholastic institutions from one end of the state
to the other.

The complaint of the college leaders was
Summarized by Provost Ernest C. Moore of Cali-
fornia university’s Los Angeles branch, who de-
clarcd that on adult issues students should hold
their tongues “until they master the tools which
the race has found indispensable."

Perhaps the California schools were jllsll<
fled in exerting control over these Student move-
ments, which they branded as “Red." But re»
gardless of that, the declaration of Provost Moore
hardly holds the answer to the problem. Now
that American youth is stirring from its leth—
argy it would Seen) that the California educator
would have it return to that State in fear of
what may happen if its growing dissatisfaction

with existing conditions is allowed to culminate
in action.

Many of “the tools which the race has found
indispensable,” have in rcccnt years been exposed
as utterly useless. The utility of many others
is widely suspected. Independent thought and
action, unbound by precedent, should not be
denied the American college student, for upon
him rests much of the responsibility of freeing
this country from its bewildering dilemma.

. (3.—
FIE, PRESIDENT DENNET‘T!

The matter of higher education for all or
Specialized training for a select few will probably
be a qucstion in scholastic circles for many years
to come. But when stated baldly, as by Presi-
dent Tyler Dennett of Williams college in re-
cently refusing SRE aid for students at that
school, the latter possiblity appears not a little
bigoted and selfish; and the former, made to
Seem less remote in the light of the great general
appreciation of government assistance to college
students, appears the much more dcsirable.

In refusing any degree of government assist»
ance for Williams students, President Dennett dc»
livered a bitter attack upon the whole program.
His arguments were hardly distinctive, being
very characteristic of the proponents of the lais-
seZ-faire attitude.

It helps the unfit to survive. “What appears
to be needed is not more college graduates but
fewer and better ones.” declared Mr. Dennett. More-
over, by accepting aid in an emergency, colleges
will be demoralized into permanent dependence
on the government, he charges—adding “I there-
fore regard this procedure as little less than dc-
plorable. I think it would be much better to
request that colleges readjust themselves at once
to a new economic situation, pare their budgets
accordingly and go on a reduced enrollment
basis."

Under this general indictment any individual
who lacks the wherewithal to pay his way
through college is, per ipso facto, unfit to be given
a college education. What assumption could be
more absurd?

As for the educator’s second charge, it is all
very well for the head of a small, aristocratic,
highly endowed institution to hurl such scathing
criticisms at the policy of government aid for
students. Whether or no the policy is continued
will make little difference to Williams, but that
does not alter the fact that these funds are a
Godsend to many smaller, less fortunate pri-
vately»endowed Schoolsinot to mention their
value to many large universities, such as the
University of California which has 1,898 students
receiving aid from the SRE, and Minnesota which
reports 1,158.

If those who adhere to the belief that only a
select few should be privileged to receive higher
education have no better justification for their
attitude than President Dennett, may their dreams
never be realized!

Other Opinions

LEADING THE WAY

A revoluionary step, that will be considered quite
radical and out of the question by some, was taken
recently at Dartmouth.

Dormitories there have accepted the student—control
plan, devised by the new committee on student residence.
headed by the Dean Lloyd K, Neidlinger.

The acceptance of thrs plan means that every dorm-
itory wlll be free from supervision of the college and all
powers of discipline will be vested in a student board.

while in iLself this may not be a move of great
significance, it is one of several that many of the eastern
institutions have taken that indicates a trend in educa—
tion, Specifically, the living conditions for men in many
01 the middle western institutions are quite as advanced
as can be desired.

In other respecLs, however, our colleges and univer.
sities of the central and western half of the United
States have been conspicuously phlegmatic in their moves
toward a broader system of education. Research on the
problems of learning have been carried out to a large
extent in the east, though research in science is pushed
forward with great rapidity here in the middle west.

And not only have these eastern institutions doubted
the dogmatic policies of education, but they have in-
vestigated these practices and changed when they felt
it desirable. Which, when analyzed, appears only natural

For some time the student body of the United States
has been definitely on the road to maturity. Recognized
to some extent by even our western institutions, the
student of today is undoubtedly more serious.mindcd
than the student body of 20, or even 10, years ago.

But in most colleges and universities he is accepted
on the sztme level as everilhat of a somewhat adole—
scent high school student. And all this in these aduca.
tional centers where we are trained to be men and
women.

Great changes are due in the field of education.
Where will they come from and how long will it take
to get them?

Armaments Race
Becoming Mania
Says Professor

(During the summer months Dr,
Alfred J. Pearson, proressor at
Drake university, spent a great
deal of his vacation touring in
Europe and Germany. The fol.
lowing anicle, written especially
for The Scarlet and Black and
the Associated Collegiate Press,
gives his views on the present
world political situation as he
sees it in light of the investigations
he made during the summer.)

By mt. ALFRED .1, PEARSON

DES MOINES, Iowa; (ACP)—Last
year the world spent approximately
four and one-half billion dollars on
armaments. The race for increased
armaments is on among all the larger
nations. They are obsessed with it.
It has become a mania with them. In
their madness they are headed for
the abyss, This year the total ex-
penditure for the same purpose will
be over five billion. Nothing but a
fundamental change in their attitude,
a complete change of heart, will
save them and civilization from com-
plctc ruin.

Mussolini rattled the sabre at E0.
logna some weeks ago. in a public
address he declared with his custom.
ary vehemence that “Italy will arm.
ltaly must be prepared not for the
war tomorrow but for the war of to.
day." This is in defiance of a defir
cit in the Italian treasury of 550,000,-
000 lire and despite the fact that
maximum taxation in italy has al-
ready been reached. And only re.
cently Mussolini made the further
statement that boys are to be given
military training from the age of eight
years,

Cutting Wages

The Italian government is now re.
sorting in cuﬁ in wages and the re»
duction of Salaries for the purpose
of reducing the cost of production.
By this means, Mussolini hopes to
counteract the unfavomble trade bal—
ance. This wage reduction is lower-
ing still further the standard of live
ing

The expenditures for the Italian
navy for the next five years, begin.
ning 1935, have been increased 480,7
000,000 lire and for the strengthenivv
of the air fleet the sum of 1,000,000,-
000 lirc has been appropriated.

in this connection it is significant
to note that on June 5, 1934 the
Erench Chamber of Deputies approved
the government's budget calling for

Russia Drilling Large Army

The Soviet Union is feverishly
building airplanes. she is drilling
both men and women for military
service. The U. S, S. R. has a train—
ed army of 3,500,00 men and on short
notice can put into the field 18,000,000
men. Japan knows this and is work.
ing day and night to keep up the race.
in Europe every ninth man wears a
uniform. On June 11, 1934 the dis.
armament conference adjourned after
two and a third years of fruitless
work.

The slogan among the nations Seems
to be that the cannon must be fed,
even if the people have to starve.

There is, however, a glimmer of
hope, Germany, if offered parity in
arms with other nations, will come
back to the League of Nations. The
Soviet Union has been admitted as
a member of the League. America
now seems to be in a mood to work
in closer cooperation with it. This
might be the beginning of a new day_
