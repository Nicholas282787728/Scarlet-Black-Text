reached regarding the commencement

from Music Critic

(By ll. w. MATLACli)

Charming to listen to in every rice
tail. and just as charming to look at,
so far as they could be seen in tllcl
dim cloistral twilight, thc Grinncll
college Women's Glee club once more
demonstrated the traditional minute
training in clarity and diction. and
the sweet gentle tone quality which
has been their special contribution to
our mu 'cal lift for the past 27 years.

Pos. ssing this season not inaliyl
voices of outstanding brilliancy, the
club's ensemble nevertheless is ex-
ceptionally smooth and rich, and thc
girls sang their parts so clearly and;
flexibly that it was always a pleasure‘
to follow them. A little more bril-
liahcy in the first soprano, with a lit»
tle loss restraint in the climaxesl
might have been welcome, and a little

sional vivid contrasts would have re-
Iieved some of the sombreness with
which the evening as a whole was
slightly enshl‘ouded. But the exquisite
finish of everything that was done
was to a great measure a compensa-
tion for the absence of exciting mo-
ments.
Superior Sololsts

No loss delightful than the quality
of the club’s singing was the uniform—
ly superior- excellence of its soloists.
0f the halfrdozen who had Spec
cial parts thcrc was not one who did

fcctively, and that is saying a lot.
The two featured Sopranos, Jean
strublc and lrma Cooper, have
lcarncd to an exceptional dcgi-ce tho
union of words with toncs which is

big songs and smple songs with

1equal effect, and it would he hard to

beat Jean's tender rendering of her
encore song, “Waterboy.”

done too. but not more than her oth-

Regular Period
Allowed Seniors
for Test Study

"Seniors taking comprehensive ex-
aminations will have the usual two-
day reading period plus an additional
two or three days in which to com~
plete their review." Henry S. Conard,
acting dean of the faculty, announced
Thursday when interviewed regard
ing the length of the senior reading
period.

“While no specific provision has
been made for a longer reading pe-
riod," he continued, ”Still the students
in reality will have an extended one
as a result of the fact that senior
examinations commence on the Mon-
day or Tuesday following the begin
ning of the regular tests. Regular ex-
aminations begin on Friday. May 25,
while senior tests will start on May
28 or 29," The examinations begin-
ning on Monday or Tuesday will cx»
tend over a three day period and will
be given in three-hour sessions.

Mr, Conard also explained that in
order to better acquaint the student
with the types of questions that may
be expected, sample examinations
have been prepared by the different
departments and may be looked over
for the purpose of gaining ideas about
the material which will probably be
covered.

"The faculty is endeavoring to
make the comprehensive examinations
as fair as possible." Mr. Cohen}
stated. This is being done in accord-
ance with the recommendations of
the committee on educational polic-
ies for the college, part of which are
reprinted:

"It is recommended that through
conferences during the semester the
student should be fully apprised of
the expectations of the professor in
the senior final examination. and that
conversely the professor should be-
come fully aware of what he may
reasonably expect of the student.
The questions for the examinations
should be made on the basis of this
mutual understanding."
