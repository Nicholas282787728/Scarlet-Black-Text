urday, Coach Les Duke announced
yesterday that he will take the four-

rather unexpected victory, as dope-
sters had figured Iowa or Iowa State

“We are going to the Butler Re-
lays, of course, with the express idea
of winning thc mile relay event, and
it seems that we have a pretty good
chance," Duke said, "tor the team is
in fine condition."

for Magazines

Movie, Women’s Journals

Prove Most Popular

on Local Campus

Educational benefits are farthest
from the minds of magazine-reading
college students; when they road it is
only for pleasure, They demand good
light fiction and as a result the gen-
eral sales of women's magazines
soar above competitive classes atthc
Crinncli news stands. The “Ladies'
Home Journal," "VVomitn'S Home
Companion" and ”McCall's" lead this
group.

Movie and confe. ion magazines
rank second in popularity among stu-
dents, In Crinnell there are more
than one hundred “True Stories" sold
each month, No preference is shown
between the screen magazines so long
as they cost only 10 cents.

The circulation of weekly maga-

 

 

Survey Reveals Student Preference
Printing Light Fiction

zines, “The Saturday Evening Post,”
"Collicr's," and “leerty," comes
near the head of the list in populari-
ty. Many coeds buy fashion maga-
zines and an increasing number of
men are purchasing "Esquire,"

Partly because quality magazines
depend upon subscriptions rather
than news stand sales, such maga—
zines as “Harper's" and "Atlantic
Monthly" disappear slowly from tho
racks.

Thc sale of humor magazines with
er indicates that college students
are losing their sense of humor.
"College Humor" and “University"
have been forced to discontinue pubs
lication: there are only a few “Film
Funs" sold monthly; and the hundred-
a»month sales of "Ballylioo" have
dwindled to a mere two or three,

l=ulp magazines enjoy a surprising
amount of popularity, Detective
stories lead in this field, but “Pop”
and “Spicy Stories" also hold con-
siderable attraction, mainly for the
men.

son, Leslie Mnnns and Julius Sauei- in

ball team was the first in 17 years to
