ON THE ROAD BACK

For the first time since the withdrawal of the
Big Six schools from the Missouri Valley confer-
ence, the latter group has really regained its
feet and now stands in a good way to establish
itself as one of the stronger conferences of the
mid-west. The future of the conference has
been in very serious danger in the past few years,
but with the admittance of Washbum and Tulsa,
the secession of Butler and, lately, with the intro»
duction of a three-game minimum for qualiﬁca-
tion for future football titles, the conference has
placed itself in its strongest position since 1927.

Butler never seemed to fit in the Valley
group. In the first place it was so remote from
other members of the loop that trips to its campus
were very expensive; secondly, and even more
to the point, it was always suspected that the
Bulldogs joined the conference simply to clear
their skirts (to murder a metaphor) in the eyes
of the North Central Association of Colleges and
Secondary Schools, which was at the time hold—
ing them in ill repute. This accomplished ap-
parently, the Indiana school promptly withdrew.

The benefit of adding two such respected
schools as Tulsa university and Washburn college
to the Valley fold need not be discussed. The
conference could accommodate still another mem-
ber very nicely, preferably a northern school, but
the present set-up is a much more desirious one
than that of 1933 and earlier.

.e The mix-up in which the conference football
season ended this year made it obvious that a
game minimum should be set for eligibility for
the conference title. The three-game minimum
is a step in the right direction, but an even great-
er number might appropriately be required. Inter—
est in the Big Six has been increased very ap-
preciably since it introduced its round-robin grid
schedule. This would be somewhat impractical
in the Missouri Valley in which the games draw
too small crowds to finance the two or three long
trips each season which this plan would necessi—
tate. However, a four—game minimum might
prove as practical as the present arrangement
and serve to arouse greater interest in the con-
ference race.

At any rate, it's pleasant to see the Missouri
Valley apparently headed for more prosperous
clays and back to the respected position it held
preceding the withdrawal of the Big Six.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND B CK

A RESPONSIBILITY RECOGNIZED

President Roosevelt in his address on Tues-
day to a convention for law enforcement, struck
the keynote of a great drive against crime which
is in the process of formation by the federal goVa
ernment. Responsibility for the correction of
lawlessness is to be assumed by the national
government. The Department of Justice in
Washington D. C. is to be the headquarters for
a national campaign against crime.

Thus again the federal government is moving
into a field formerly reserved to the states and
local government. Crime has been recognized
as the national responsibility which it should
have been for some time past.

Obviously the reason for the action of the
federal. government is the failure of local author—
ities to control the crime situation. Rural police
have become victims of politics, going in and out
of office with each transfer of power from one
party to another. Affiliation with the Winning
party has, in most cases, been the most important
qualification for office, Little effort has been
made to equip the rural police in an up to date
manner. Inadequate organization of loCal uniw
has caused inefficiency and plundering in the
capture of criminals. In many cities special
interests have corrupted the police to such an ex-
tent that honest, efficient law enforcement is
practically impossible.

The blame for this laxness in local enforce-
ment rests not so much upon crooked politicians
or incompetent officers of the law, as upon the
indifference of the American public. There has
been an appalling lack of public support and un»
derstanding of the problems of local law enforce~
ment.

If the national government is to succeed in
its drive against crime, it must have the support
and close cooperation of all the units of law en—
forcement in the land And if the local agencies
are to become effective aids in the war against
crime, the citizens must take an interest in see
ing that able men are put into the offices of the
law enforcement agencies, that they are supplied
with adequate modem and scientific equipment,
and that they are freed from party rule and the
subversive influences of corrupt interests. It
is the duty of every citizen of this country to
arouse himself and his neighbors from the leth-
argy of indifference, and by such methods as are
within his power, to improve local law enforce-
ment, In this way he can aid the national gov—
ernment in its New Deal in fighting crime and
enhance its possibility of success.

UNLIMITED CUTS
(The Daily Pennsylvanian)

Several years ago the University of Chicago, under
the administration of their new president, inaugurated a
policy of unlimited cuts for all undergraduates. At first
this news met with outcries of radicalism, stupidity and
nonsense. Most leading institutions agreed that to put
into the hands of innocent undergraduates such a potent
weapon as unlimimd cuts would be nothing short of
suicide. And it was suicide.

Suicide for the professols who could not hold their
classes. For by reason of optional class attendance
students could pick the worthwhile. interesting courses,
allow the droning lecturer or willy—nilly professor of
Something-or—other to fascinate an empty Classroom. In
no time at all those men who were unable to beach,
who were unsuited for educational purposes, were rapidly
dropped by a wise administration which then prooeeded
to install in their stead men who could, and did, offer
knowledge. And in two years the class attendance at
the University of Chicago was higher under the un.
lirnlted cut system than it. had been under the old, anti.
quated, present system now in force at practically every
institution of its kind in the country.

Furthermore, those undergraduates who did not be—
long in college dropped out. And those professors who
likewise did not belong, dropped out as well. We be.
lieve that this is the ideal situation.

Perhaps Pennsylvania is too staid to even consider
this proposition. Perhaps they think that their enroll.
ment would fail to that of a small oollcge. Perhaps they
think no one would ever go to classes.

At any rate the administration can never be a. sec.
and University of Chicago—a really liberal institutioniun-
til they at least consider the plan.

Freedom of the collegiate press
means nothing to Senator Huey Long,
when the needom oi Huey Long is
called into question, Issuing a state.
ment upon his recent censorship of
the Louisiana State paper, Huey Said,

“This is my university and I'll. throw.

anybody out who utters a word
against it. There’ll be a new editor
of that paper tomorrow if they print
anything against Huey Long."

. . .

And now the Senator, through the
president of the school, has done just
that—26 studean have been “liquidaL
ed" because they asked that the staff
of the student paper be reinstated,
after the staff had resigned in protest
of Huey’s tactics. Twenty-two said
”Uncle” and were forgiven, but the
rest are still in the dog houee.

The favorite bit of reminiscence for
a Minnesota professor concenis his
early days when he once ended a
lecture by asking for questions from
the students. There was no response,
so he waited, growing more and me. .

question. Another long silcrlce. Fin.

Girls in a dormitory at the Univerr
sity of Kansas decided that they were
indulging too freely in cuss words
when their stockings developed runs,
when the coffee turned out bad, etc.
So they opened a pool, operated an
honor system. When a girl says
“darnit” she puts in a half a cent.
“Damn” brings a cent and a half.
After the first five days there was
$1.67 in the pool.

So. one day, he got into a huddle

Scientist Einstein would have no
examinations in his ideal university,
no drilling oi the memory. “It would
be mainly a process of appeal to the
senses in order to draw out delicate

sneaking suspicion, and says as much
to students. that so»cal.led ”extra cur.
riculer activities” could be nicely Iired
out of the window.

Morley gave a smothered yelp of
delight at a luncheon at the University
of Minnesota the other day when a
professor described the difference be.

“You have to show improvement to
get out of the asylum,” said the pro-
