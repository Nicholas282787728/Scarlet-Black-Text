The statement that the average cola
lege man has no tinarrcial sense
whatsoever was amply illustrated two
ways from the ace this week when
two upperclassmen lined up a large
and enthusiastic group of preps in
iront of the pep meeting with their-
nickels in their hands (admittance
ice), turning down the golden oppol‘»
tunity to let them in tree.

The campus huzzes this tall with
the exploits ot the rcdouhl'i! le
ltleeter, who hravely crashed his
way out or a hotel room in Grand
Junction when he dreamed that he
was on ﬁre. It takes a pretty
hot man at that to woo l‘larmlsck’s
attention away 1 rom Gordon, it
only ternpororily.

Pull the whistle, Meeteri

Rctuniing unpopclassmcrt made
a concerted rush to the phone to
call Compton now that exepres.
Maxiield has been removed in the
concrete, it not in the abstract.
It's a cinch that League Board
members are going to date more
this year, they don’t have to sneak
into a dark corner [or tear oi sec»
ing a iog.stiek tlnre in a ieminine
month.

John Bemier awoke when the alarm
went oti the other night at 1-30 a L,
dressed and started for breakfast. The
reason: he got the hour and minute
hands on the clock mixed up when he
set it the night before. Nothing quite
so refreshing has happened since the
days of George Bump.

The erstwhile bachelors clnh oi
last year seems to he on its last
legs inasmuch as a series oi (era
rnsle disasters have overwhelmed
the charter members. Gould has
disappeared completely and Oli—
phant went oil the deep end down
in Vincennes with Kleplelr’s girl,

Presumably by the time that this
goes to press the preps will have pur-
chased their annual quota oi chape‘
seats, turniture, etc. How odd it is
that Roosevelt’s forgotten man away!
enrolls here tor a course. it the N
R. A. covered some of the transac-
tions that trite place here on tresh—
man week, we‘d all be in jail.

House Presidents Adopt

of House Presidents, held last Sunda;
mornin'g at the home oi Shelton L.
Beatty, dean oi men, a uniiorrn plan
was drawn up for the training oi

The next meeting oi the council'wil!
he held Monday evening, according to
Marion Frye, leader or the group.
