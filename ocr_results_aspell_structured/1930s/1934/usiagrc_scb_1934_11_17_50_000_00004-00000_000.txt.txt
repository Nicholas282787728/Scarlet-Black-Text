Gideonse Scores
Critics of Capitalism

Critics of a capitalistic form of gov.
ernment olten blame an impersonal
"Social order" {or certain undesirable
happenings rather than to Search lor
responsibilities that are nearer home,
Likewise, present day comment on
the growth of nationalism and the
possibility of another world War ns-
ually runs in economic terms. These,
according to the critics, are supposed
to be "inevitable under capitalism."
This was the keynote of the lirst of
two addresses by Harry D, Gideonse,
associate professor of economics at
the University of Chicago, presented
at 10 o'clock this morning.

Professor Gideonse, who recently re,
turned from Europe, spoke to the con.
ference on, “Is Peace Possible Under
Capitalism?”

Quoting from Ralph Waldo Emers
son, the speaker opened his address
with: “Society has played out its
last stroke. It is checkmated. Young
men have no hope. Adults stand
like dayelaboreis, idle in the streets.
None calleth us to labor, The pre-
sent generation is bankrupt of prim
ciples and hope, as of property."
That pessimistic feeling will be sup.
ercedcd by optimism when recovery
comes and will be as out of date as
the canal boat or the stage coach, the
speaker declared.

Mr. Gideonse proclaimed as false
the ideas of the critics of capitalism
that crime, corrupt politics, and bank
lailures were “inevitable under cap.
italism." He also scoffed at the idea
that the growth of nationalism and
the possibility of another world war
are likewise inevitable under capital-
ism.

Most of the recent criticism that
politics is controlled by the capitalist
will not stand up under close scrutiny,
assorted the speaker,

ln concluding, Professor Gideonse
stated that some of these contem-
porary critics should be reminded that
many men in government really do
not according to principle, irrespec-
tive of cost, and in referring to the
economic capitalism of today as com.
pared to new radical orders, that
there is no special merit in “advanced"
ideas if one is ”advancing” down a
blind alley.

Hume Discusses

Russian Foreign Relations

The radical change in the Soviet
foreign policy within the last year
was emphasized by the Rev. Theodore
Hume this morning in his lccture on
“Russia’s Changing. Relations. With
Europe,” Within the last few months,
he pointed out, Russia has entered into
. policy of wholeheartcd mternatronal

cooperation instead of regarding her-

stent danger of attack by capitalistic
nations.

“Russia has followed four dittcrent
foreign policies in the years since the
Revolution, Mr. Hume explained, The
period li‘om 1917 to 1921 was one of
self detense during which Russia was
attacked on all sides by the cap~
italistic nations. From 1921 to 1918
Russia pursued a policy of armed
peace in Europe and or peacctui
propaganda in China. This action was
caused by the necessity for peace
with which to carry out domestic pole
icies, the speaker explained,

The third period of the Soviet for-
eign policy extends {mm 1923 to 1933
and was the period of the Five Year
plan, Russia was devoting her ener.
gies to building socialism and adopt—
ed a policy of compromise, The last
period saw Russia embark upon a pol.
icy of international cooperation.

“There are four steps in the develop—
ment of this latest policy," the speak—
cr statcd, “These steps wore—the
sharing in the disarmament conlcr.
cncc of 1932, the recognition of ch.
iet Russia by the United States, the
completion of a series ol non.aggres—
sion pace with European neighbors,

 

and the entrance of Russia into the
League ol Nations,"

Dengler Explains

Problems in Austria

"The government of Austria today
is extraordinarily weak because it de—
pends upon only oneethird of thcpeo.
pie for its support»and even this one-
third is divided," declaled Paul Deli—
gler, Austrian educator, in his lec-
ture Friday night in Herrick cha 1
There are three parties in Austria, he
explained, the Nazi, Socialist
Conservative groups

in discussing the topic “Austria and
Her Neighbors," Dr. Denglei pointed
out that Austria, and especially Vien—
na, has a long history dating
to Roman times, and that today Aus—
tria is one of the most irnportantparis
of Europe as a result of the possibil—
ity of war developing there.

Austria, while at present dominated
by the Conservative party represent-
ed by the Heimwehr, still has to
consider the other two parties—the
Nazis and the Socialists. The two
groups are now suppressed, but they
are maintaining their organization
secretly.

“If the govemment of Austria break:
down, either through an uprising of
one of the suppressed groups or as a
result of a 1'0th rebellion of the two
suppnssed pm-tits, all of Europe will
become involved," Mr. Dengler stat-
ed. Should the Nazi party secure
the upper hand, then Italy would send
troops across the southern Austrian
border. 1f the Socialists gain con—
trol the Czechoslovakian troops
will move in from the north and

Capture vicnua. Likewise Jugoslovia
and Roumaliia would take advantage
ol the situation to send troops into
Austria, the speaker declared, Each of
thcsc countries are supporting a dll»
fercnt party and hence would bccome
involved. The result would be to
turn Austria into a battlefield for four
dilrcrcnt armies,

in closing, tho speakcr made a pica
tor faith and patience in dealing with
other peoples, and suggested that en-
vironment had much to do with the
sccmingiy queer actions of other
races and that this tact should be
taken into consideration.

Hold to Liberalism,
Waymack Begs in Address

That liberalism is withstanding the
strain or present economic and social
conditions, is the behci of W. w.
Waymack as revealed in his address
yesterday aitemoon entitled “The
Challenge to Liberalism,"

Because many countries are tending
to pull away lromhberalism and demo-
cracy, certain peoplc are challenging
the soundness of their principles. Mr,
Waymack, who is associate editor of
the Des Moines Register, contends
that democracy will last,

“Liberalism is based upon the
'thcory ol‘ individual sovereignty, upon
which a greater sovereignty rests,”
stated the speaker,

The whole of Asia and all of tic
major European countries, with the
exception of France, are being gov.
erned by dictators in an oligarchic
form of government.

“We must, however, expect a change
in liberalism,” declared Mr. wry.
mack. One change that is tn bc doe
sired is an improvement in the me.
chanics of government so as to make
it workable, Education can be grime
ly developed .ind politics should be
purged ot its “uncleanliness.”

“The followers of oligarchy believe
that they have established a perman—
cnt system which cannot be changed,"
pointed out the speaker, “whilc demo-
cracy is a means to an end, a method
01 change.”

Liberalism has been really
functioning only in the last century,
according to Waymack, and a period
of poliu'cal rc-cducation is beginning.

leaders had planned a policy adapt.

policy was not applicable to the situ.

Wallace asserted.

value of 750 million to one bi ion dole

Germany has changed from a credi—
tor nation loaning 60 million a year,
to a debtor nation bon~owing the same
amount annually," said the speaker,in
explaining “the arithmatic of the in-
ternational situation.”

“United States is merely stop.
gapping at the present with the Agr- .
cultural Adjustment act and similar
measures. It must rcoognize the
problem for what it is, and act ac-
cordingly," he asserted.

Warning Given

A number of level-headed Amer-
icans pointed out the predicament
which the country was getting itself in.
to, long before the
generally recognized, but no mechan.
ism exists to promote action on such
Warnings. “Such key decisions must
be openly expressed and a medium
provided through which they can be
acted upon before the American econe
omic maladjustment can be correcte
ed," Secretary Wallace opined,

the problem, but merely provide a

declared, branding the situation of
that year as unreal, “a mirage.”

The secretary oi agriculture exprese
sed the hope that a type of public
service such as is found in England,
with specific college training for civil
service careers, may soon be es-
tablished in this country.

He concluded with the statement
