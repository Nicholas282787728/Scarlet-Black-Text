son, Mickey Frye, Herve Oliphant, and
Bill Parzybok are veterans at this
post. Eugene Klepfer was the leading
reserve last year, and John McMurray

able of playing at forward positions.

wards, Coach 'I‘ruesdale has been ex-

and Bob Morgan, who stands 6 tool,
«we inches, both of whom are round
illg slowly into shape following the
football season.

The graduation of Capt, Gaston San—
tl and Les Manns, stellar guards last
year, left a serious hole in the Grin—
nell defense. lDuMont and McMui’ray
have showed up well at these posi—
tions. Jim Bradley, capable reserve
of last year, was issued equipment
Tuesday, but is as yet unable to take
part in strenuous practicc because of
the injury to his kidneys suffered dure
ing the football season. Paul Nice
Cully and Bill Fowler are other guards
who have a very good chance of seed
ing action this year. .

Untermeyer Praises Work
of Modern Collegiate Poets

GREENCAS'ILE, Ind—ACE 7“The
poetry produced by American college
students today is more disciplined and
promising than it ever was in the past,"
Mr, Louis Untcrmeyer, tamed anthol—
ogist and poet, told a university stu.
dent journalist rc~cnt1y.

“The collegiate age, 13 to 20, is that
period of life most conducive to writ—
ing poetry,” he said. “Then, the emo-
tions are most alive, and the impulse
to write and express oneself is al.
most second nature.

“There is much surprisingly excele
lent vars‘e emanating from university
writers, too — even in the accepted,
orthodox forms such as the sonnet. Of
course the vivacity, of youth always
scales expression in sheer radicalism,
unrhyined, heretical."

"In advising young poets i should
urge: experiment, experiment!” said
the author smiling at his Boswell.
“Try all the fonne, especially those
you don't like. Improve your taste and
technique; above all, serve an oppren.
ticeship in stnicture—crottsmanship,
not trying to spin an epic at 21, At
that period the philosophy and emo-
tlom are not sufficiently tried to be
interpreted.”
