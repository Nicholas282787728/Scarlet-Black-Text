King Park, editor of the Male
teaser and campus cartoonist,
playing center on the Clark hall
B cage team, tied the score for
Rawson hall at 10 to 1D in the sec.
ond half of the ClarkeRaWson game
Monday, by sinking a hasket for
his opponents

AS the Clark players recovered
the hall from the Kelly bahkboard.
Park received a pass, waited until
the other nine players had started
to dash for the other end of the
floor, and then coolly sank a shot
from the foul lineiiu the wrong
basket! Immediately realizing his

- mistake, he shook hands with all
members of the Rawson team,
and the game, which Clark won
16 to 11, was resumed.

Should the southenders
tower quintets. Dibble will be left
with undisputed claim to the title.
Should Gates win both games, hows
ever, a tie will result between Dibble
and Gates, The Gates B five is fa—
vored to win, but the game between
the A teams is a toss-up with Gates
a slight favorite.

Clark and Rawson B teams fought
out an overtime battle Monday night
with the Clark five coming out vic-
torious,1s to 11. This loss leaves
‘Rawson in the cellar position while
Clark can gain a tie with Langan
for fourth place should the Clark A
team defeat Rawson A,

Dibble gained first place in the a
section by trouncing Kelly, 26 to 9
Saturday. Boardman, Dibble pivot
man, was the bulwark of the Winv
ners' otfense, scoring 16 points.

Langan and Smith split a double
header Saturday with the Langan A

spill the

 

five winning, 31 to 15, and the Smith
quintet taking the B contest, 21 to i).
In the A game, Smith threw a score
into the Langsn outfit during- the
first half which ended with the
southendcrs ahead, 10 to 9. Lengan
rallied in the sccoud half, with Hor-
ton and Slye finding the hoop regu-
larly, to win decisively.
