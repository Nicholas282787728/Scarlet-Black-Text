Tulsa to Make
League Debut

Meets Creighton in Initial
Valley Contest

TULSA, Okla., (Special)—On the
night ol January 3, 1935, the Univer—
sity of Tulsa will make its official
bow as a member of the Missouri Val—
ley conference.

The occasion will be the Golden
Hurricane’s opening basketball game
of the conference Campaign, and to
help Tulsa Celebrate the occasion the
always—powerful Creighton Eluejays
will he on hand to furnish the opposi»
tion. The contest will be played in
’l\ilsa.

Six Veterans Back

Six veterans will make the boys
Coached by Chet Benefiel one of the
conference powers from the start. Joe
Moor-man, a two-letter man, will cap.
tain the team from his foiward posh
lion Herb Larson, forward and center;
Gordon Smock, forward; Jim Kilpal.
rick, center; Woodrow ﬁscal and How-
ard Clark, guards, are the other let-
termen available. Smock, however, is
graduated at midyear.

Most important additions to the
squad this year are Carl Bowen, an
all—state guard at Tulsa High school,
and Lester Chapman, sophomore toote
hall tackle and basketball Center who
was an outstanding freshman eager
last year.

Ex—Cripples Return

Kilpatrick, Larson and Moorman, all
were ill or injured during most oi
last season which saw an unpreccd.
ented wave of hard luck overtake the
Hurricane. All three, however, will
be available this winter.

This jinx wrecked the Tulsa season
to the extent that it could only win
three of six games in the Big Four
Conference, and won three andlost
six non-conference contests. The
team boosted the best defensive le-
Cord in the Big Four, but lacked scor—
ing punch.

Expects Better Team

Coach Benefiel expects a 25 per
cent better team this year. A squad
of 12 men is already at work {or the
opening game Dec. 20 at Edmond,
Okla, against Central Teachers. His
chief problem is converting guards
and Centers into forwards. not a man
on the squad having played regularly
at forward before this year.

Benefiel. who has tutored Tulsa
cage teams since 1932 and is a grad.
uate of the school, has outlined a
program of 15 games, including two
with Arkansas for which the dates
have not yet been set. Tulsa will
play the regular conference double
round-robin schedule.

Record Hung up Last Year
Best Made by Grinnell

in Sixteen Years

thn Grinnoll opens another sea—
Son with the State Teachers game on
Monday it will be entering its four
hundred and sixty.tliird cage contest.
Its record now stands at 237 wins and
225 defeaLs over a period of 34 years.
in the course of this period the Pion.
eers have opposed teams from 49 diffe
crent institutions.

All this, and a hundred and one
other bits of interesting infoimetion,
may be found in the records kept on
in the men’s gymnasium.

Seventeen Big Seasons

Only once in the first 18 seasons of
basketball, which was established as
a varsity sport at Grinneil college in
1900-01, did the Pioneers fail to win
more than half of their games; the
lone exception was the 1915.16 season
when the local quintet broke even
with six wins and six defeats.

0n the other hand, from 1917-18 on
—until last yearithe scarlet and
black cagers failed to average as high
as .500 a single time. Last winter,
with a record of x victories against
7 losses, the Pioneers hung up the
best record in 16 years.

Clear Slate Twice

nell went through the season undo.
feated, winiiing‘id games during the
former season and 11 during the latter
The most disastrous years were 1925.
26 and 1926.27, when the Pioneers
were able to chalk up only one and
two wins, respectively, '

Of the three major Iowa schools,
which have appeared most frequently
upon the Grinnell basketball schedule
iIowa, Drake and Iowa State—only
the latter holds an edge over the Pion-
eers. The Ames quintels have won
two more Contesu than their Grin-
nell opponents, 21 and 19 being the re.
spective totals. The locals held a 22
to 14 margin over the state university
when the two schools ccased cage
competition with one another. The
Grinnell rivalry with Drake is of
longer standing than that with any
other school. The Pioneers and Bull—
dogs have met 51 times, with the lau.
rel going to Grinncll 28 times and to
Drake 23.

Many Close Gaines

Not only have the Pioneers met
Drake more times than any other
school, but the competition has been
keener than against any other oppon.
ent. Although Grinnell won the first
21 contests betwen the two schools,
and Drake the succeeding 16, Close
games have been frequent. since 1915,
14 of the Contests have been decided
by a margin of four pcinits or less,

 

while eight of that number were won
by either one or two points.

The worst trimming ever administ.
cred by the Pionecis was suffered by
Leander Clark college oi Toledo, Iowa
~now for some years disbanded the
scarlet and black dribblcrs winning
78 to 25. Nearly as humiliating, or
perhaps more so, were the 13.3 de-
ieat of Ames in 1913 and the 31.1
wallopmg the locals dealt Cornell in
1920.

On the other side oi the ledger arc
the 37.2 beating which the Pioneers
received at the hands of Minnesota in
1902 and the 56-27 licking administer.
ed by Oklahoma in 1927.

High: and Low of It

A variation of 95 points is to be
[ound in the total scores of Grinnoll
games. The record low is the 6.5 vie.
tory of the Pioneers over lowa in 1903,
while the "track meet" which the
Oklahoma Aggies won in 1928 by a
54—43 count remains the albtime high,
excepting the previously mentioned
78.28 win over Leander Clark.

Coach John C. Truesdale camc tr
Grinnell in 1927, iollowing the dis-
estrous seasons oi ’25—26 and 26.27
when the Pioneers won a combined
total of three games. Since taking
over the reigns, Coach D-uesdale has
done much to ie.establish Grinnell
as an ever-dangerous cage opponent
His season records tor the last seven
years are 77—23—315; 23.297353; '29—
30—.333; ’30»41~.487; 31.32750 '32—

Seventeen Crinne" Women
Play Hockey at Iowa City

Seventeen women, members of tho
first and second elbslar hockey teams,
participated in a hockey meet at Iowa
City Saturday morning, Nov. 24. The
games were informal, and compe-
tition was not stressed.

Not all the members of the Grin-
nell first team made the trip and
substitutions were made from the
second team. The team thus organized
was defeated by the Iowa League team
by a 2.0 score,

The lineup oi the Grinnell team
included: Mildred Williams, Jacquel.
ine Preston, Margaret Moldy, Beih
Collette, Kathryn Avery, Jeanette Van
Steenberg, Trudy Lynn. Maxine Coats,
Margaret Vance, Florence Rice and
Decky Miller.

For lack of a complete team, players
from lowa City were used in fill out
the Grinnell second outfit, which op»
posed a group made up of students
from the university.

Grinnell women who engaged in
the second team game were Mary
Mullcr, Elizabeih Kline, Christine
Chiodo, Elizabeth Sherman. Mary
Elizabeth Whitehill. and Miss Leone
