Training Needed
The need for training in the proper
method oi talking beiore a micro—
phone—either 'over the radio or
through‘a public address‘system—‘is a
very real one today. For the use oi
the voice ampliﬁer is spreading, and
political messages, sports announce—
ments, lectures, sermons, alter—dinner
speeches, and informal talks and an.
nouncements are included among the
material delivered into the little cy.

Hopes For Class
This is the reason why Sara Sher»
man Pryor director oi the Grinnelt
college department oi drama, is hoping
to incorporate a class in'radia broad—
casting into the schedule in the' near iu.

Such a' class would entail the

l‘oud,” explained Mrs, Pryor. “In the
second place, he stands too close to
the microphone.”

A normal speaking voicc should he
maintained, the Grinncll drama in.
structure declared, and the speaker
should stand with his face from six
inches to one ioot away from the
microphone. At the same time, he
should talk directly into’the appara-
tus. ' ‘

Here are some pointers on talking‘
into the microphone, as explained by
Mrs. Pryor,

1. Keep the voice low with a re.
sonant quality. Avoid nasal tones.

2, Overdo the conscnanbiparllc.
ularly the “t” or the “d” at the end
of a word. This will eliminate such
words as “Siewd-n" irom the loud
speaker when the announcer is really
trying to say, “student."

a. Prolong the vowels.

4. Enunciatc with the lips. “Don't
let your voice gui‘gle in your throat."

“It is because of these qualities that
the British speaking voicc is better
adapted to radio work than that of
the American," Mrs. Pryor declared.

If such a class is oiiered at Grinnelli
particular attention will bc given to
the correct broadcasting oi dramatic
selections, Mrs Pryor sairl,

Why did he come here?
That’s what WC want to tell
you.

He was looking for a value
instead of a bargain. He was
aiter tailoring, rather than
talk. He wanted style that
a dry cleaner couldn’t budge
and a fit that a tailor could-
n’t better . . . and there he
goes, Gentlemen . . . “it’s in
the bag” . . , or, rather, we
should say, the box.
