senior rally in the second frame put

”Why is Christmas?”

 

“‘Hay Fever’ Well Done, Amusing But
Rather too Difficult for Amateurs”

Characterizations by Smith,
Harper, Searle Praised

by Niemeyer

By CARL A. NIEMEYER

There are several reasons why 3
Noel Coward play is not a particularly
happy choice for young non.pr-ofes.
sional actors. in the first placc, Mr.
Coward’s neurotic and complex char.
asters are not easily interpreted even
by competent professionals (witness
the failure of ”Design for Living” to
be anything but another movie).

SCARLET FEVER“

According to Dr. J. T. Padgham,
city health officer, and Dr. John
Parish, physician in chargc, Forrest
Huston, '35, is under temporary
quarantine at the Community hos.
pital, suspected of having scarlet
fever,

“All the symptoms of scarlet fev.
er were present," Dr. Padgham stat.
ed this afternoon, "thought it will
not be known for Certain (or a day
or so if Huston really has the dis.
ease.”

Huston’s room mate, William
Sampson, ’33, will be confined to
his room until next weekend, and
all residens of Clark hall, when?
Huston resides. will be cxpectcd to
submit. to a daily examination for
symptoms of the fever.

As a safety precaution. Dr. Far.
ish urges any student who is both.
ered with a sore throat within the
next few days to see Mrs. Katherine
c. Farley, college nurse, for an ex.
amination, to prevent any possibility
of an epidemic.

All of Steiner
Prizes But One
’35

 

Dropped for

Due to an overdraft of past years
on the income from the Henry York
Steiner prize fund it will be possible
to give only one prize this year. This
prize, according to the committee on
prizes and awards, will be given to
the student submitting the best orig.
inal play.

Information concerning all of the
prize awards to be given this spring
was released by the committee yes.
terday.

The Seldon Whitcomb poetry prizes,
richest of the annual awards, will
again be given in the form of scholar.
ships. Three scholarships, to the value
of $120, $80 and $40, will be awarded
for the best original poetry written by
undergraduate students of the college.

500 Line Maximum

The poems or groups of poems sub.
mitted must have a minimum of 50
lines and a maximum of 500 lines
Special permission granting a lar.
gcr maximum may be obtained if the
type of poem makes it necessary to
exceed this limit.

The Marburg peace prize, awarded
annually for thc best cssay submitted
on the subject of international organi.
zation, will be given for the last time
this year. It was provided when the
grant was made in 1933 that thc $100
award should be made for three years,

Book [or Prizes

Any senior is eligible for the Harry
1. Worth prize, which is given to the
possessor of the best pcrsonal library.
The entraan should attach a certi»
fication of ownership in submitting
their lists of books. The prize con.
sisLs of one or two books, valued at
$6, selected jointly by the winner and
the awards Committee. In addition,
Modern Library, lnc., awards the an.
nual winner ﬁve books, the titles of
which hc is privileged to select.

April 15 has bccn set as the date
upon which all of the competitions
will close. The awards commiltce,
which IS headed by Miss Sarah Illness
MacDonald, has agreed that no time
extension shall be grantcd this ycar,
as at times in the past. Since the judges
require ample time to makc their dc-
Cisions.

 

In the second place, Mr. Coward has
acquired, rightly or wrongly. a rep.
utation for extreme sophistication that
is likely to make incongruous a per.
fonnance of his plays by amateurs.

Woll nonc, Amusing

These reasons being admitted, onc
must admit too that, despite them, last
night’s perfolmance of “Hay Fever"
was well done and amusing. True,
the play started. slowly; or at any rate
the audience refused to laugh at the
exchange of innuendo between Sorel
(Rita Phelps) and Simon ,.(Carter
Kirk). ’

As the act wore on, however, and
Jane Searle, Larry Smith. and Dorothy
Harper made their appearance, the
performance brightened; and by the
beginning of the second act all the
cast had achieved a lively tcmpo
which they maintained until the
end of the play. The audience was
amused and must have gone away
satisfied with the evening’s entertain.
ment.

Questionable iniorprctation

in the minds of some more may
have lingered a few doubts; the part of
the actress striving desperately to keep
her youth although she must Confess
to the possession of two full grown
children, Leona Chisholm seemed to
interpret as farcical. Such an inter.
pretation is easy, and for a youthful
actress it may well be that no other
is possible. But Judith is not a char.
acter of far if he meant anything,
Mr. Coward must have meant her to
bc a satirical study; but the finesse
of true satire was lacking in Friday's
pcntormance.

Lacking too in the whole play was
the vital touch, no doubt obtainable
only by professionals, that would have
made “Hay Fever" what it properly

At that time qualifying evens will

As the dopc now stand». the mcct

seniors and the freshmen with tho lln.

said ycserday. The seniors have by
far tlic most individual stars, he stated,
while the freshmen have the most
material and will probably gain most

Members Vote
to Alter Status
of Speech Club

Members of the Men’s Forensic club
Wednesday night decided against dis.
handing the organization and moved
to make it an honorary society. The
membership basis will be changed
from the method of tl‘yrouts used in
the past to an elective membership,
to be granted to those who have been
ousmnding in speech work.

Joseph Conard, president of the
group, called the meeting in his mum
in Smith hall where the alterations
and changcs were voted by tlrc mcm.
bers. A committee was named by
Canard, consisting of Robert Wilcox
and Robert Snavely, to confer with
him in formulating definite plans for
the revised organization,

in stating thc need for immediate
changes, Conard mentioned that the
primary funcritns ot the organizarion
had been assumed by othcl campus
groups, so that the Forensic c‘ub has
been reduced to a society devoid of
any practical purposes. He further in.
dicatcd the need for adopting a defin-
ite plan of action, of admitting the
weakness and calling the Club “honor.
ar-y" in name as well as in fact, or in
disbanding it altogether

in accepting the ncw plan, the group
voted to hold two meetings during thc
year. one in the spring for the new
members, and another as a “get to.
gether” meeting somctlmc during thc
year.
