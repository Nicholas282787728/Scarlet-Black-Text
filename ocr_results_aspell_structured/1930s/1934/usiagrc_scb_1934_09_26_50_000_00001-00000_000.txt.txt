Early Season

Dope Favors
Grinnell Foe

Fowler, Graves Only Sophs
Scheduled to Start
Game Saturday

By FRANK BEATLE

First in the list of obstacles beiorc
the 1934 Grmneli college football
team, Michigan State college will play
what is jocularly termed ”host” to
22 Pioneer gridders at East Lansing,
Mich, Saturday afternoon for the
third successive season.

it's a tough first»gnme assignment
for any team. when the horde of
Michigan State boys pours out onto
the gridiron before the game Saturday,
the small squad of Pioneers will get
in one comer of the ﬁeld—if there is
room—and run plays. Yet in the two
past seasons, Grinnell has managed
to win respect for its Michigan per—
formances, and this year the wearers
of the scarlet and black are deter.
mined to show that size and number
of players means nothing at all,
Two sophomores to Start

Two sophomores, Bill Fowler, cen-
ter, and Berger Graves, tackle, have
broken into the starting lineup for
Saturday's game by virtue of their
outstanding performances in practice
sessions and in last week's scrimmage
between lettermen and reserves. The
lineup, in all probability, according to
Watt Tuesday. will consist of Ander-
son and Phelps, 1% pounds each, ends;
Morgan, 2155* pounds, and Graves, 173
pounds tackles; Sutton, 175 pounds
and Meeter, 210 pounds, guards; Fow—
ler, 175 pounds, center; Kingery, 145
pounds, quarterback; Bradley, 175
pounds, and Clark, 175, pounds half-
backs; Fini, 173 pounds, fullback.
The complete list of the 22 play
who will leave Friday on the north-
ern trek has not yet been compiled
by Watt because of injuries. It is ex-
pected, however, that injured men,
with one exception, will be in shape
by the end of the week. That man,
Don Malum, 185 pound guard, suffer—
ed a tom ligament in his Shoulder
last week, and it is highly probable
that he will be unable to don mole-
skins again this Season,

Five tin Sick List

Other injuries, including Sutlnn's
sprained wrist, Eaucr's bruised hip,‘
Boardman’s bruised side, McFarlin's
shoulder, and Trumbull’s sprained
thumb should be improved by Satur—
day,

The Pioneers are in much butter
shape to appear in their first game
this year than they were last. Three
full weeks oi practice have developed
timing of plays. and blocking fuld
lHC g far beyond the point rpm-li-
ed by time oi the initial Contest in
1933, There is a change in attitude
this year which must also be taken
into consideration when doping the
outcome of Grinnell games. Squad
members are determined that this sea-
son will be a distinct improvement
