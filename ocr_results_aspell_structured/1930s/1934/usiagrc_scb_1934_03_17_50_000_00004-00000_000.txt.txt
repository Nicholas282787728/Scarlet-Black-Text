Need Brightness

Although music for girls’ voices oc—
cupies one of the minor‘ fields of mu-
sical expression, they have a lovely
quality in ensemble. and when they
are trained as artistically as the Grin-
nell club has been trained in its long
career under Professor Pierce they
give so much pleasure that it is a
mystery why the chapel isn't filled
to hear them, Perhaps it is because
of the limitations of their field, and
the absence of vivid and thrilling
contrasts which glorify a great musia
cal program.

The girls could help this a lot by
letting a little brightness fall on the
situation now and then, Their songs
would have gained tremendously in
effect had the audience been able to
see the program, to know what was
going on, and to see the girls‘ faces as
they sang. Euvclopcd, as we were,
in a gloom that was almost sepul-
chral, it was hard for enthusiasm to
get the upper hand, and when it did,
to bring the girls back for encores, it
seemed almost irreverent, When you
get to know them, these girls aren't
the least bit nun-like Why they
should choose such a repressed set-
ting fcr their gay songs is hard to
understand, Don't do it again, girls;
