RENTAL SHELF

At the beginning of each college year practi~
cally every student promises himself that a goodly
portion of his spare time will be spent in doing
some non-required reading. Unfortunately the
fruits of these earnest resolves are seldom record-
ed in the library circulation figures. The student
tends to confine his outside reading to some of the
weightici- journals, like the Saturday Evening
Post or Colliers Weekly.

It is natural that a Student with no literary
background is loathe to plunge into the much re-
puted classics or to turn to a many-aged com-
mentary on the field of his interest. It is surpris-
ing, however, how easy and pleasurable that sort
of reading can become when one has established
the habit of doing some additional readingreach'
week. There have even been commerce and
science majors who upset the long-standing trad—
itions of their fellows by acquiring the art of vol-

_ untary reading.

To initiate the noon reader into what is still
the world’s greatest pastime the college library
maintains a shelf of popular fiction and non—fic-
tion books. This section, known as the rental
shelf, contains the best sellers of the day in addi-
tion to those books which are thought to be of
inmost to the greatest number in the college
community.

A nominal rental of two cents a day is charg.
ed and the reader may keep the book as long as
he cares to.

As an introduction to the type at work se.
lected for this popular shelf, three thumbnail re-
views of books added to the collection during the
summer months are presented elsewhere in this
issue.

The only available criterion of student inter—
est in these popular works is the patronage the
shelf receives. Criticisms and suggestions for
books to he added will be welcomed by members
of the library staff.

“PATRONIZE OUR ADVERTISERS"

This plea is seen frequently‘ in most publica»
tions which depend upon the revenue from adver<
tisers for their existence. In this, The scarlet
and Black is no exception.

Our request, however, is not so much that
the students buy from the paper advertisers—for
it is certain that they do. Our request is that
you give'the advertising in these pages the at
tention it deserves, and TELL the advertisers
when Scarlet and Black advertising prompts you
to purchase items at their stores.

The advertisers make their special bargains
known to you through these pages that you, as
well as they themselves, may profit. It is just
as much to your interest to read the advertising
matter as to read the news contents of the paper.

You can save many a dollar this year by
giving constant attention to The Scarlet and
Black ads. So we beg of you, buy, save—and
TELL.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

INSPIRATION

Recently Mr. J. Tracy Garrett, publisher of
the Burlington Hawk-Eyc-Gazette, came to the
newly established Scarlet and Black office. 0n
scanning the workshop, the visiting newspaper
man spied the diminuativc, red writing desk,
which because oi a financial situation, was being
utilized,

“Entirely too small for such important work,"
the publisher remarked.

Several days later the Scarlet and Black
received a letter from Mr. Garrett with the infor—
mation that he had made arrangements to send a
desk that is no longer being used by his news
paper.

This desk, according to the benefactor, is
one of the oldest owned by his paper. Such men
as Bob Burdette, the famous humorist, are said
to have written copy on its walnut top. The desk
has been in use since the Cival War, so that stor-
ies of strife, murder, romance, and politics have
been written and rewritten on it for over three
quarters of a century.

The members of the Scarlet and Black staff
should derive considerable inspiration while using
it, with the realizaton that for four score years
it has served journalists of note.

NEW POLITICAL PARTIES

During the course of the current congression—
al campaign there is securing a very marked mo
adjustment of the standards of our two major
political parties. Many of the traditional issues
have long been empty phrases and meaningless
utterances used by politicians during election
campaigns, and forgotten as completely as possible
when the desired offices have been attained.

Today the country is endeavoring to find a
solution to serious social and economic diffi-
culties. The government is constantly being con-
fronted with new problems which must be work-
ed out in order to better the conditions of the
people.

At the head of one of our great parties is a
group of men who believe in social experimenta-
tion and the trial of advanced economic theories.

They believe in increased government particip—
ation in industry, and are endeavoring to promote
social welfare through the agency of the national

government. Within the ranks of this, the Demo-

cratic party, are rising many prominent liberals
who one day may become it’s leaders.

On the other hand, the Republican party
looks with disfavor upon the liberalism oi the
Democrats, and opposes any attempt to change
the present economic and social setup. While
there is a group in the Democratic party urging
a back-to-fundamentals movement, it is more
than likely that they will ally themselves with the
conservative party. The term “New Dealers” has
become synonolnous in our minds with that of
Democratic, while the term “conservative" we
associate with that of Republican Thus the new
issues of our day are changing the whole nature
of our political parties.

This realignment will result in a much sharp-
er distinction between the parties. No longer
will one vote for a name only. Our political
parties will become something more than a group
of traditions The straddling of issues will not
be possible because of the wide cleavage of poli—
cies. The natural differences in men’s way of
thinking will be expressed in the new alignment
of political parties, and in consequence a much
more effective and efficient party government
will he achieved.

STATE PRODUCED MUNITIONS?

The Social bogey, which drew the attention
of the American Legion away from bonus lobby-
ing long enough for the organization of a cam-
paign for the defense and preservation of the Con-
stitution, is still pursuing the war veterans.

when John Thomas Taylor, Legion ”legislm
tive representative” in Washington, predicted that
the national Legion convention at: Miami, Fla,
next month would advocate stiff penalties for
wartime profiteers, and a universal wartime draft
law, not even the Daughters of the American Re»
volution could ﬁnd room for complaint, and
Chairman Nye of the senate munitions committee
applauded the plan.

But Nye added vinegar to the syrup. Making
it clear that he strongly favored government mas
nopoly of munitions production, he added to his
approval of the Legion plan the declaration that
”The private munitions manufacturers must be
destroyed or be regulated more closely than any
other private business.”

Legion officials were probably not pleased
with the linking of the two plans, with the ac-
companying threat to private initiative. There
should be some consolation, however, in the fact
that the idea is not exclusively socialistic. Mus-
solini’s Facist Italy last week financed the revival
of a huge muition corporation, with a former high
state official in charge.

Munition plants are assuming an import—
ance that presages voluminous business under any
management.

Have You Read----

 

By TED KLEIN

Damon Runyon’s “Blue Plnlc Specs
inl", wilh' a [orcword by Walter
Winchell.

This is a grand collection of thirteen
short stories told in Damon Runyon's
inimitable, racy brand of Broadway
slang, All the stories have been pub—
lished in magazines before, but you've
probably only chanced upon a few of
them. One of them, “Little Miss
Marker" ha already been made into
a movie, and more are sure to follow.
bccausc they are natural screen nia—
torial.

The stories center about. Broadway
and the Roaring Forties. The people
in them are gamblers, gangstcrs.
chorus girls, speakeasy proprietors.
race track touts, beer runners, and
others in vague rackets. The plots
of most of the stories are built around
the concern ot the so-called “pfomlnw
ent characters." on Broadway over
the problem of gaining a comlortable
living without doing an strictly legal
work,

Damon Runyon has spent his life
on Broadway and he writes with keen
appreciation of the peculiarities of
that most colorful American cross
roads, at Times Square. His writing
seems to have caught the accelerated
tempo of one side of o great city and
will attract both those interested in
making, as well as those in observing
their Americans.

”Mr. Pidgcou’s Island”, by Anthony
Berkley.

This unusual mystery story should
be of interest to college students be~

 

cause it unfolds the sometimes dime
iul consequences of a thirst for know—
ledge. Let it also serve as an omi»
nous warning to that. most irritating
of the species, the practical joker.

Mr Pidgeon, an Ortord don who has
unexpectedly inherited a barrel of
money, buys a yacht and an unin.
habitcd island and invites a curiously
assoncd group of men and women for
a cruise. After conti-iving to have
his guests and himseli marocnerl on the
island, he informs them that one of
their number is a murderer. That
night Mr. Pidgeon is killed by a fall
irom a cliit, and there is evidence in—
dicating that his fall was not accidente
al.

The situation is complicated by the
fact that few of Mr. Pldgeon’s guests
are known to each other, and because
they are of such widely dlffering
temperaments that they will naturally
be suspicious of each other. The
chief interest in the study lies in the
manner in which various persons of
the story conduct themselves in the
trying situation in which they are
placed.

Mr. Berkley has evidently tried to
get away from the conventional pat-
terns of detective fiction, and he has
succeeded not only in that, but in
producing an unusually good story.

quant charm, and atmosphere all their.
own. ”Wild Strawberries” is that
kind of novel.

A story of contemporary England
built about a family of country gen—
tl'y, the Leslies, it is written with an
understanding of the small things that
go to make up the lives of this group
of people. The humor is typically
English and to those susceptible to
that dry wit the book will provide
an evening oft good chuckles.

Mrs. Thirkell, the author, IS a
cousin of Rudyard Kipling and Mr.
Stanley Baldwin. Ii your father votcs
