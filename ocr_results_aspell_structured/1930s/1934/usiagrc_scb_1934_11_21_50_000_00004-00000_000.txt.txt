THE GRINNELL SCARLET A

SPORTS

By PAT GALLAGHER

The Cornell eleven has developed
with surprising rapidity since the
first of the year, It was not many
weeks ago that the Purple team bare—
ly eked out a sea win over Knox,
door mat of the Midwest conference
and present holder of the national
record for consecutive losses. The de.
fenders of dear old Siwash have built
up the unbelievable total of 25
straight entries on the wrong side of
the ledger, making the 24.game mark
of Hobart college, ex—champions, look
like a piker record.

a a . .

But to get back to Cornell's pro-
gress, the rurple by no means
looked like easy pickin’s when
they toppled the strong Simpson
team last week by the very re-
spectable score of 13.0, if you
can remember back that far, you
may recall that early in the sen.
son that self-same Simpson out.
ht made Drake battle for 60 min—
utes with the very unsatisfactory
reward (as for as the Bulldogs

were concerned) of n 6 to ii tie.

Your guess is as good as the next
fellow's in predicting the outcome
of the Drakeecieigbton game this Sat.
urday. The two outfits have met three
teams in commonmwith very befud-
dling results~ Creighton was nipped
by Haskell, 7-6, while later the Bull-
dogs dropped the Indians by a 19‘s
score. On the other hand, the Okla.
homa Aggies defeated Drake 7-0, and
took a 13.7 trimming at the hands
of the Jays. They both took Grin-
nell into camp, making the result just
about six of one and half a dozen of
the other.

Marquette game last Saturday,

Coach Frank Murray oi the north.

crners decided to insert every

man in uniform into the lineup
when his troup acquired the com-

paratively safe lead of 38 to 0.

Seeing the coach motioning to

him, a fourth-string quarterback,

who was engaged in escorting one
end of the yardage chain up and
down the. field, came on the run
around the end of the field and
down to the bench—a jaunt of

173 yards—only to be so exhaust-

ed from the exertion and excite.

ment that he collapsed. The near-
tradegy was diverted, however,

_w'hcn he recovered in time to see

two minutes' action, .. .1.

Returning h: our own backyard for
the momentijust how is one to score
a game such as the cored hockey out-
fits held last night on Ward field?
Here’s a practical application of the
problem—if the Grinnell backfield,
playing behind the Cornell line,
should score twice through the Grlne
nell line, which was engaged in pro.
tecting the Purple backfield; and Cor.
nell, using its own line, should score
once on the united Pioneer forces—
who’d have the right to tear up the
goal posts? Looks to us like it was
a matter for the philosophy depanr
ment.

The powerful Washington team was

last weekend, the other three active
members all meeting a fate similar
to that of the Aggies. The Bears

Meanwhile, the conference leaders,
Creighton, were receiving a sound lac.

The Hilltoppers kept the Jays well
under control throughout the game,
while Art Guepe, Marquette sopho-
more ﬂash, ran wild' to score four

Grinnell Upset

The Grinnell—Coe fracas, however,
was somewhat of an upset. While the
Pioneers were given no better than
an even chance at victory, their com-
plete collapse in the second half and
the resulting 29.0 trouncing was whol.
ly unexpected.

Creighton will have its first chance
at a Valley grid title next. Saturday
when it tackles Drake at Des Momes.
The two teams sport comparable ree
cords for the season thus far, Both
won over Grinnell, the Jays lost to
Haskell and won from Oklahoma A.

order.‘ '

The Oklahoma Aggies will meet
their traditional rival. the University
of Oklahoma, and Grinnell will clash
with Cornell college_ to complete the
Valley bill for this weekend.

‘Grinnell-in-China’

Term Explained

(Continued From Page 1)

the Porter-Wycoff Middle school or
Powen Chung Hsucch in Chinese, and
is composed of two schoolsithe Pore
[er school for boys and the Wycoff
school for girls. “Middle” Schools in
China correspond to the six. years of
junior high and high school in Amer.
ica, Mr. Gall stated,
Two Grads on Staff

At present, two Grinnell graduates
are on the staff: Alice C_ Read, '13,
and Y. H. Wang, '28, who is the prin.
cipal. It is largely through the efforts
of these two people that this school
has advanced so rapidly and is so
important in the province of Shane
tung.

Through the pcrsisteney of Mr
Wang, Grinnell-in-China has recently
been registered with the government_
The problem of registeration of
schools in China is of utmost im—
portance, Mr. Galt continued,

Denied Registration

The educational authorities of the
government have a regulation that all
private schools must be registered or
their students cannot transfer to gov.
emment or public schools, For years
the Grinnell school has been quali-
fied for such registration, but through
some discrimination by the commis»
sioner, excuses were made and the
Grinnell protege was not recognized
officially.

The barrier has been lifted, how-
ever, and through Mr. Wang's per.
sistant efforts. the desired registra.
tion was completed Besides his work
in Grinnell-in—China, Wang was re—
cently appointed chairman of 1119 edu—
cational committee for the Shantung,
Chansi, and Lintsing provinces,

At present, there are 18 members

 

on the faculty and the students total
273. This is the largest enrollment
the school has known despite the ad.
verse conditions now prevalent in
China.

Athletics Popular

When questioned as to the athletic
interesLs oﬂ thestudenls Lhcrc,Mr. Galt
explained that both boys and girls
participate in basketball, football7
which is very much like American
socccritennis, and track events. A
few inter-scholastic games are played,
buL clue to the scarcity of competitive
schools, most contests are between
groups within the college,

The Rev. IVLr. Gait was stationed
550 miles from chhow for about
seven years and for many years be—
fore that was situated less thcn .100
miles from the Grinnell School.

Pre-Law Club Will Hold
Business Meeting Thursday

The Pro-law club will hold a meet.
ing at 7:15 o’clock tomorrow evening
in Clark hali club room to complete
the organization of the group. At this
time committees will be appointed and
the frequency of future meetings will
be discussed,

“The purpose of the club," accordr
ing to a statement made by William
Maxeiner, president of the club, “is
to give us a nucleus about which we
can organize our interest in law. with
such definite organization we hope
to further that interest."

Anyone interested in ti- club is in.
vited to attend the nwig lom‘or-
row evening.

Changes Planned

in Prep Pro gram

(Continued From Page 1)

the hall government and decisive
changes in the present governing
policies The Honor G club, the pres.
idents' council and the house coun-
cils will cooperate in putting a new
and less autocratic government into
effect, in which persuasion by exam—
ple will be employed rather than force
to promote freshman discipline.

President Nollen and Dean Beatty
have both highly commended the ac—
tion of the men’s ruling organizations
and the efficient manner in which
they have undertaken to set up the
new syslem.

Men Take Iniiintivo

After emphasizing the fact that the
initiative has been taken by the men
and not by the college administration,
President Nollen stated this morning
that the whole matter is one of “do.
ing away with an old and obsolete
system and substituting a new and
constructive program in its place.”

Mr. Deatty asserts that both the
council and the Honor G club have
been developing their plans under the
assumption that the old system of
hazing will be abandoned, although
no official demand to this effect has
been made by the college administtae
tion, “The men plan to start from

 

the
he

scratch, incorporating none of
old program in the new system,"
said this morning,

nry Explains Plan

“The new plan,” Mar-ion Frye de—
clared yesterday, “will be designed
to promote a socially constructive pro-
gram toward the freshmen.”

Anderson said this noon that after the
meeting last night. the feeling among
members of the Honor G club indicat.
ed complete assent to the plan. “In
an endeavor to make the Honor G
a better club, the 'New Deal’ with
regard to prepping was suggested."
As a result, the members decided to
give the new plan a trial in order ’to
bring about closer cooperation be.
tween the club and the administra-
tion, Anderson concluded.

Actual formation of the new pro~
gram will take place at a joint meet—
ing of the Council of House Presidents
and the Honor G club tomorrow
night.

CHARM TALKS EESUMED.

After a week’s cessation due to the
international Relations conference,
the series of charm talks being spanr
sored by the Young Women's chr'
tian association will be resumed to—
monow with Mrs. Blanche S. Leonard
presenting the talk, Mrs. Leonard
has announced as her topic, “Elements
of charm."
