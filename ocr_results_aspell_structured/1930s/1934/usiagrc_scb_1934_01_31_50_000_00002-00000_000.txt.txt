FOUR YEARS OF LIVING
College is a formative period. It is not only
four years of preparation, but it is four years of
living, And what is more, these four years should
be among the most memorable ill a man’s life.

A speaker at a dinner hcld recently for the
residcnts of one of the men’s halls made, the apt
remark that college days were not the happiest
days in one's life. The happiest days were never
ill the present, he explained, but in the past. For
the ten years following his graduation from col-
lege, he believed that the time which he had spent
at Grinnell was his happiest; then, for tllc next ten
years, he looked back on the first ten» ear period

' as occupying this l'orcmost place ill his thought
And thus it is. Memory softens experience and son
lects its material from those few glowing incidents
and events which can be separated from the pro-
saic or the disagreeable.

So college years are a matter of living, not
only for lncmory’s sake, but for the sake of sheer
enjoyment during a period which will never be re-
peated. Educators sometimes forget tllis when
they speak of college preparation 'l the cold-
shower effect of entrance into the business world,
of the need f ’t broad knowledge of political and
economic zlffai ‘, and of the proper utilization of
leisure time after the college period.

Lest someone misinterpret these statements,
we hasten to say that this is not a plea to throw
hooks, lessons and caution to the winds in ex-
change for a grand and glorious sprcc. That is not
what we mean by four years of living. There is
pure enjoyment and happiness to be derived from
the successful solving of problems, the mastery of
a subject, and the learning of new facts, if, in ad
dition to this idea of preparing for a futllrcnced.
the student has the capacity to seek enjoyment lll
whatever he docs. Available, also, are the cujoyr
able human associations, the social affairs which
have their place in the lives of every one who is
not a pedantic Puritan, the extracurricular ﬂclll'lr
ties in which the individual may ,(lcvclop and di
play his talents for the gratification of his ego.
and such cnjoynlcnts related to college life as good
books, interesting speakers, and the best of music.

Preparation? It cannot help but he. Living
college life to the full prepares one for the commu-
ation of worthwhile clljoylnents, and provldes for

the memories which sooner or later are all that re-
'lll'lilll

A VOTE 01“ THANKS

Many are the new precedents which have been
established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
directly or indirectly, since his inauguration. IIis
immediate appropriation of many powers previous
ly denied the president of the United States found
the people amazed but acquitscent. Last night the
people of the country united ill tllc establishment
of an equally unprecedented action when they fete
ed their very lnucll alive leader with a nationwide
celebration of his birthday. It was a tribute such
as has never before bccn paid a. living president--
a fitting tribute to the indomitable and courageous
spirit of the man.

Nearly thirteen years ago, Franklin D. Roosc-
volt, then in the prilnc of life and already clltcrcd
upon a promising political career, was striken with
infantile paralysis. At first physicians feared for
his life. Gradually hc regained strength, but he was
left a hopeless cripple, apparently doomed to tllc
life of an invalid, and his political career definitely
ended.

From Warm Springs, Georgia calnc the tale of
a young mall who had regained the use of his
paralyzed limbs, by swimming in ollc of tllc pools
from which the town gained its name. Mr. Rooser
velt optimistically gave the treatment a trial. His
ensuing recovery has become a national legend of
cheerful optimism and faith. With the proceeds
from the 6,000 parties held last evening this warllr
spring treatment will be made available to hunr
drcds of paralytics who could not otherwise afford
it.

PARADOX
(The Columbia Spectator)

What lies behind this curious paradox of men who
are extracurricular successes and scholastic stragglers?
. .We believe that these campus leaders have been the
victims of a college system which offers too many dise
tractions to incoming freshmen. To the student in his
first year in new surroundings, extracurricular activi-
ties seemingly offer the only means of establishing
one‘s identity. *

To gain a place in his new college sun the freshman
goes out for some sport, or for the campus paper, or for
the glee club or dramatic society. He spends increasing
amounts of time on these and other activities until his
studies are gradually relegated to the background. Per-
haps he joins a fraternity or becomes entangled in can»
pus politics. All this takes time and the natural thing to
do is to shelve studies. Thus the freshman gets off to a
bad scholastic start.

His campus prominency may grow steadily but his
academic record is a succession of valiant attempts to
pass courses on the basis of one or two nights crunlmr
mg. If and when he graduates, it is with a sense of
having passed several years in an academic atmosphere
Without having breathed deeply of tbe scholastic air.

Is there a remedy? We should like to suggest the
prohibition of all freshman participation in any rmeliy
organized activity. As we see it, freshman activ 165 off-
er the present greatest menace to the development of a
better standard of social and academic college work.
The transition from secondary schools to college is ale
ready wide enough a scholastic gap without adding to it
the distraction of extracurricular work.

Give the student a year in which to find himself
scholastically and he will develop maturer habits of
study and association with his fellows in the college
community. If he want‘s to play baseball or football or
tennis, let him do it informally and with no sense of
obligation, And the same holds true with writing or act~
ing or any other non—athletic organization. . .Hastc
makes waste in everythingiand in nothing more than a
fieshman's attempt to become a campus entity during
his first year.

A MODEST PROPOSAL
(Columbia Spectator)

From Berlin comes a decree, issued by the minister
of interior, limiting the number of entrants into the
universities and academics in 1934 to 15,000. The female
quote. will be 1500 or 10 per cent of the total. Accord
ing to the statement of a. German offical, the purpose
of this decree is to prevent “biological race suicide"
through overeclucotion "because it is notorious that the
educated classes produce the fewest crildrcn."

And Hitler needs all the children the uneducated
classes can produce. He and Mussolini, both loVeI‘S of
peace see the way to territorial expansion by overcrowd-
ing the population. The inevitable clasb becomes a mat—
ter of generations. Then it comes. Millions of men and
women are blown up into pieces thus necessitating the
birth of more children to replace the human fertilizer.
Those people who believe that the way to solve the
problem of employment is to Lake a couple of million
paupers and throw them into the Atlantic ocean, must
see the fallacy of their argument. Even Dean Swift,
author of the famous" a Modest Proposal,” would have
to see the fallacy in the solution he offered to solve the
irish problem 01' overpopulation. a dictator--O'anfy,

perhaps-would come along and urge greater pro-
creation.
