House Presidents last week. No
repr scntatirc of the newspaper
\\ present alid tlle suggestion
did not come from the manage,-
lncnt of the. publication.

Two years ago, the manage-
ment of the (‘yelono backed a
movement to place the subscrip»
tion price to the year book in the
semester fee fund. Tile matter
was brought to a student vote and
deeisivelv defeated. During this
time, The Scarlet and Black
strongly expressed its opposition
to the suggestion. reasoning that
such a more would be unfair to
other publications and would set
a precedent for all such activities.
The argument was also advanced
by the newspaper editor that
puhl . lions uhiell could not
stand on their own feet should not
be supported by a forced sulr
scriptioll.

.Tlie policy of The Scarlet and
Black ill r rd to surh a matter
has not changed since that time.
It is opposed to the subsidizing of
eoilege publications llcre, regard
less of the advantages n'llieli
might be gained ill the way of in—

that students are more ritall ’n-

The Scarlet and Black reecives

THE SKY’S THE LIMIT

The phenomenal 4 :(lS,-t mile I‘Hll
hy Glenn Cunningham of Kansas
in an eastern indoor tl-aek meet
last Saturday caused a good deal
of comment concerning the, illlv'l'lr
ing progre ' made in trite nild
field athletics during the, past
three or four decades.

In 1898 a runner by the, name
of R, B. Smith turned in all iur
door mile perforliiancc of 4:372.
It was the, first time an athlete
had t:0\'CI't‘,(l this distance iildoo
in loss than 4:40, and marked a
step ill track history of that time
Very comparable to the advance

In following year , the mark
has been steadily lowered. The.
new standard is a trilmt to thir—

Illellt—rin track and field equipr
lneut partiall, flint primarily ill
training methods and plii'SI ,al ro-
ordination. One is almost led to
wonder whether the vast improve
incnt over past, records docs not
denote an actual physical superi-
ority of modern athletes over
those of earlier years.

The day is not far passed when
:09.6 seconds was considered lin-
heatalile ill the lOOa‘al'd dash,
when Ted Meredith’s quarter-
mile record of :47.4 seemed safe
from all further assaults, and

ll'illi’s 4:10 mark ill the mile

these standards have liven lowered

CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS

(The Minnesota Daily)
During the long months of the de-
pression when millions of unemployed
taxed the relief agencies beyond ca-
pacity, predictions that we were fast
approaching social revolution have
been common. There were guarded
prophecies that it was only a few
months until the red flag would
wave in the United states. We have
frequently heard that. the uprising of
the exploited masses was forestallcd
only by the liberal provisions of the
New Deal.

For these reasons, the public atti-
tude toward Barbara Hutton, the 40-
miliion dollar Woolworth heiress,
who married the Prince serge Mdi
vani, is of unusual interest, From her
private car the youthful princess
Steps onto a boat for the Orient while
scores of servants move the innumer-
able pieces of baggage to the eighty
eenn-oom suite. in the newsreels we
see a crowded San Francisco dock,

where the multitude cheers a. rousing,

farewell to the multi-milIionaii'e Prin-
cess.
Meanwhile the Prince Mdivani flies

 

to Seattle to take another boai so
as to avoid a California subpeona
server. A short time later the news-
papers carry the message to a wait
lug world that the couple have re-
united in the Orient to continue their
travels amidst splendor where fancy
takes them.

According to some of ollr theorists
the multitude at the dock sllould‘
have been sneel‘ing instead of cheer
ing, the masses writing letters to
their congressmen demanding confis~
eatery taxes on incomes of the rich,
and the working girls in department
stores should be muttering among
themselves about. “social injustice"
instead of reading of Hollywood
marriages in movie magazines, and
the gentlemen in tin: campus smok-
ing rooms should he taliring of the
need for forceful action instead of the
beauty of the heiress and whether
they would trade places with the
Prince. Apparently the seeds of So-
eial revolution have not yet germi-
nnted.

In his three-paint address at suiri
day vespers, the Rev, James T. Mor-’
dy, pastor of Cottage Grove Avenue
Presbyterian church of Des Moines,‘
stressed certainty, sincerity and seifr
lessness as prerequisites to a perfect‘
understanding of life's vicissitudes. ,

The Rev. Mr. Mordy asserted “Al-l
though we have heard many times;
that we should be sincere, certain‘
and unthinking of ourselves, we must:
maintain the meaning of these wordsi
for they are the key notes to happy,
and cc-operative living.” , ‘

The speaker spoke often of experi-l
ences in his own life, which he told to.
help his audience form a synthesis,
between these time-worn but stable
expressions and modern lives. ‘

Watch out for the telltale
signs of jangled nerves

 

Other people notice them—even
when you don‘t—little nervous
habits that are the danger signal
for jangled nerves.

And remember, right or wrong,
people put their own interpreta-
tions on them.

So it pays to watch your nerves.

Get enough sleep—fresh air—rec-
reation—and make Camels your
cigarette, particularly if you are
a steady smoker.

For remember, Camel‘s cost-
lier tobaccos never jangle your
nerves—no matter how many you
smoke.

COSTLIER TOBACCOS
Camels are made from ﬁner, MORE EXPENSIVE
TOBACCOS than any other popular brand of cigarettes!
