OMAHA, NebeEither the thir-
teenth straight Creighton victory
over Grinneli cage teams or the ji x
that will turn the tide is on the slate
for Saturday night in Omaha, when
the Blueiays and the Pioneer-s meet
in an important conference battle,

Second place in the Missouri Valley
conference race will be at stake Sat—

Drake are tied for runner-up honors.
with Grinnell close behind and to hold
their position the Jays must beat
the Pioneers,

Bluejflys Favored

While all odds favor Coach A. A.
Schabinger and his high—flying Blue-
jays, Grinnell has made rapid strides
since it lost an early season game to
Creighton by a 37-20 score. In addi-
tion to the conference race, Grinnell
will have the added ilicentive cf try-
ing to break Creightcn's 100 per cent
victory margin over the Pioneers.

The two schools have played 12
games on the basketball court, with
Creighton winning each time, scoring
a total of Au points to 296 for Crin-
noll an average of 34% points to 243;
per game,

Downs Marquette

Although the Pioneers have failed
thus far to win a game 1mm Creighr
ton, many of the scores have been
uncomfortably close for Coach Scha-
binger's crew, notably a 27-25 game
last season and a 21-20 game in 1930.

Last Saturday Creighton won over
the powerful Marquette quintet, con-
queror in five Big Ten contests, by a
score of 31 to 25 in a thrilling over-
time game to boost its stock nation-
ally. A perfect record in three games
against Big Six opponents likewise
gives Creighton a high sectional rat-
mg,

Entire Squad May
Make Trip

Coach J. C. Truesdale will take at
least nine men to Omaha Saturday
and possibly his entire squad, he
said today. At present he is hoping
that he may either obtain a second
team game or take the reserves to
Omaha as a reward for their untiring
effort during the season.

Although Mickey Frye suffered a
broken nose, and Hal-ye Oliphant a
ruptured blood vessel in his elbow
during the Washington game here
Monday evening, both will be able to
play Saturday,

A squad of 21 men was named
Monday by Coach Lester Duke, as
the tentative entry list for the open—
ing meet of the Pioneer indoor track
season, which will be run against
Iowa state at Ames Saturday at 2
p. rn. Seven letter men are included
on the list, while eight of the en-
trants are sophomores.

Joe Plieiffer established a new
Grinneli indoor record for the mile
for the outstanding performance
turned in by a Pioneer runner last
week, Phieffer cut two seconds from
the former mark, held by Mike Pile
brow, finishing in 4 minutes and 36
seconds, The race was run in the
local gymnasium. Tryouts held in the
Drake field house Saturday were not
so encouraging, according to Coach
Duke. The performance of the mile
relay team was especially disap-
pointing, he reported.

Strong oii Distance

Grillnell’s greatest strength Sat-
urday will lie in the middle distance
and distance events. Coach Duke has
entered four men in both the quarter
and half mile runs, and three in the
mile.

Jack Halsey, who was a consistent
winner during the cross country
competition last fall, has been show-
ing promise in the mile and is enter-
ed in that event along with Rheiffer
and McIlraih. Staiiss and Marker
have been showing up well in practice
and may develop into point—getters,
in the BSOryai-d run, Duke announced.
He expressed the hope that the com-
pctition Saturday may reveal other
men of promise,

Three Speakers

I Give Brief Talks
at Club Meeting

Three brief talks by Mrs, Laetitia
M, Conard, lecturer in social econom-
ics, Earl D. Strong, professor of cache
omics, and Archie Carter, speaker
from Cskoloosa, made up the pro-
gram of the latest meeting of the
Sunday Evening club. Each dicussed
the questions, “Is a new third party
desirable 7"

In the final talk, Professor Strong
encouraged support of the present
Democratic regime, “since Roose-
velt is reorganizing the Democratic
party to make it a liberal, reforming
organization." “This may be oppor—
lunism." he concluded, “but is it not
better to accept the opportunity for
beneficial change than to cling to

lofty ideals which can never be
realized?"
