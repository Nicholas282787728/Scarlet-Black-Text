Although two dccisive games. be-
tween Gates and Smith, remain to no
played, the period originally set for
thc intramural basketball compati-
tion has elapsed. After carefully con—
sidering all the men who competed
during the cage competition, the
sports staff of The Scarlet and Black
has selected the above is man as
most worthy of mention for their
play in the interdorm contests;

Siye proved to be the most effec-
tive forward in either section. Not
only did he lead in scoring, but he sl-
so contributed a good deal to the
efficiency of the Langan defense.
Hcmphill, Dibble, and Msxficld, Raw<
son, are chosen as his running mates
in the A section. Both displayed con-
sistently good basketball, although
Maxfield was handicapped in being
associated with a weak outfit.
