Harry Hopkins is the vivid and
colorful personality of the adminis

engaged in social work, first in the
West, later in New York, where he

governor of New York.

It is Mr. Hopkins immediate and
direct task to see that the Presi-

United States shall starve is made
good. Enormous responsibility rests
upon him in connection with the CWA,
‘ille FERA and other organizations
which are under his supervision.

Chester Davis has recently s
oeeded George N. Peek as ,admi
tratcr of the Agricultural Adjust»
ment administration. His early career
in the newspaper business began in
the Northwest; he held positions
chieﬂy in south Dakota and Mom
tana. Since meeting Prof. M. L. wil-
son of the State Agricultural College
of Montana at Bozeman, he has
been closely affiliated with the agri-
cultural program and its efforts to—
ward fami reform. As Mr. Peek's as»
sistant and a close friend of Secre»
tary Wallace, he was chosen to suc—
ceed Mr. Peek, when the latter was
transferred to another position in
connection with the building up of a
foreign trade.
