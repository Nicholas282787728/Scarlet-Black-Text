Y Southern Magazine Commends Tanager
for Appropriateness of Scarlet Cover

South Carolina Publication
Considers Local Journal

Real Inspiration

Praise for The Tanager, Grinnell
literary magazine, is contained in the
latest issue of The Lantern, literary
quarterly at Limestone college, Caff-
ney, S. C.

The essay, “on Seeing Red," by a
writer who calls himself Telco, holds
up The Tanager as an example for
other college literary magazines. it
says:

Red Covers

“Many magazines have red covers.
Some give the impression of having
red covers because the printer had
no stock of any other color. others
seem to utilize the redness of their
jackets as a warning that they are
all fuzzy and communistic insidei
like Trotsky or the Smith Brothers or
something. And some little maga-
zines rlaunt the crimson of their
covers in such a way as to suggest
that they are thumbing their tiny
noses at all the staid grownups. They
act as if they had just been reading
Carl Sandburg and wanted everyone
to know that they could also tear
their shirt, and make a razzly tazzly
noise,

“But we get one magazine in
our mail which somehow would seem
incongruous dressed in any other
color. The Tanager in blue or green
or tan would be like Carmen in ging-
ham or Garbo in clogs, To see this
literary journal, scarlet as the bird
from which it takes its name, is to be
at once reassured, assuaged with the

’knowing that somewhere there is
taste and nicety in the preparation
of the undergraduate magazine.

Broad, Sophisticated

"For three years The Tanager has
come to us lei-monthly and has re—
mained, consistent B its cover. soph-
isticated yet not too smart, broad
yet not too bold, and never frivolous
or flippant. And eighteen times we
have been moved to a passing and
ignoble jealousy, whereupon we have
reminded ourselves that this maga-
zine, as the product of the English
and journalism department at Grin-
neu college. need never worry about
social aspects or events; nor does its
pages have to be filled with undergra—
duate material.

“Editor Steiner's province is pure
ly literary, and The Tanager’s lead-
‘ing articles, stories, and poems are
by mature, and often professional
writers. Our consolation has been the
assurance that we do not have to
compete at all with the college pub-
lication which already ranks high in
metropolitan editorial circles. We
need not hope to have our own stories

Operetta Praised ‘
by Drama Critic

iContinued from Page one.

Phillips were a well balanced trio;
they had their stuff down pet, and
with the always skilfiil help of Ches-
ter Williams and Sabeth Mix as their
musical accomplices they put on a
rapid, sparkling performance that
opens another new door in our drae
matic enterprises, so zealously pro-
moted by Mrs. Pryor.

In "Fokey" the most attractive
characters were Louise Smith as
Mrs, Powhatan, and Robert Brown
as John Rolfe. in spite of the touches
of morbid psychology given to John
by the author of the play. The char-
acter of Pocahontas as conceived by
Moeller is simply terrible, but Marian
Schissel deserved admiration for
what she succeeded in doing with it.

Cowboy and Indian

Moeller-s conception of a nudist
colony of Virginia Indians is right in
line with the fat hand of burlesque
that lies heavy on this show; it was

'not so hard to look at, but it was

painful to listen to, with all the
shrill screeches and other racket
that are written into it. like a bunch
of kids playing cowboy and indisn.
“Box and Cox“ will be welcome
again and often; but there are not
many who will feel that way about
what the author intended to he a hot
little sketch, and turned out not so
hot at that.

In both plays the settings, effects.
costuming, etc, were all in the effi-
cient mann ~ of the Grinnell Players,
at least semleprofessional and often
a. lot more than that.

Fini, Graves, West Named
Three Best Boxers at Stag

Three two»round bouts of boxing
featured the stag party held in
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium
last Saturday evening by the Young
Men's Christian association.

The bouts were between Berger-
Graves and Roger Livingston, Ralph
West and Victor Fini, Roger Culbert-
son and John Majors. There was no
decision although the three best
boxers were chosen on the basis of
ability and sportsmanship. The ratings
were Fini, first; Graves, second; and
West, third. The committee of judges
was composed of G. o. Gale, J. D.
Stoops. and Don Kingery.

other features were Walter Robb’s
performance upon the parallel bars,
a wrestling bout between two high
school students, two reels of comedy,
‘and a reel of animated cartoons.
