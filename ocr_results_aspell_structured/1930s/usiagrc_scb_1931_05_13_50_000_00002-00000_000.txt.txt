PROBATION FOR LEADERS

Gl'illliell students who are placed on probation
will not he allo ' (l to hold campus o‘fﬁeos while
under that ball in the future. This addi oiial rul-
inglfor disciplining students was announced last
wee t.

The more may be logical. If student leaders
cannot avoid difficulties of demeanor they probably
deserve to lose their positions of responsibl ity C61:
thinly as long as they continue in those po itioil.
while many of their friends ltnow that they have
been guilty of breaking- soliic college rules, enforce-
ment of rules is not helped.

Leade ship cannot be eurbed by mcr removal
from posi on. The difficulty hings there. If a
house offloei were to be placed on probation and
thereby lose his position, would students be less
likely to follow his leadership? Students elect
through personality in most cases and that same
personality would be there to sway them whether
the official capacity to do so were allowed or not.

The rule is meritorious i lliat it will make the
ofﬁcer himself think twice before he commits an
offense against college ban. He may not look upon
collegiate positions seriousl, but once in such a
post he will want to avoid the stigma of losing the
ofﬁce.

EDUCATION BY CLUB MEETINGS

It is pleasant to imagine classes iii which the
students would take up ally subject of current in-
terest that appealed to them, asking a lecturer to
inform them, or discussing it themselves, as they
wished It has been argued very plausably that the
best education would colne in this way, which was
Socrates‘ means in teaching Plato Persons of an-
archistic disposition, Who are irked by grades,
notes, and the paucity of opportunity to e, press
themselves have proposed experimental colleges
like Rollins, or the abolishing of many rules at
other institutions, to approach the discussionegroup
ideal of education.

To all such these and to all ‘iltercsted in such
educational innovations. the deci on by a federal
cii uit court of appeals that. the League of In-
dustrial Democracy is an educational institution,
at least within the inclining of the income tax law,
should be of great interest.

The league works through independent college
organizations, who discuss any mattcr they choo'c.
and are not obligated to come to the conclusions
held by the headquarters of the federation. The
Liberal club at Grinnell. which has unofficial re-
lations with the L. I. D,. has di. sscd prohibition,
humanism, and a third party in student-familty
groups. , ‘

Such disct 0]] is experimental education If
the critics of g odes, of enforced class attendance,
and of coustric ion of thought to the limits of the
quadrlvium are earnestly interested in finding new
methods for the searth of truth, they will ﬁnd a
splendid opportunity ill association with some sort

in grades and tlert'i'ers, it should ul‘ticc them to

THE LEAST IS MAT’URITY
(From the Daily O’Collegian)

School days may go by with ﬂeeting speed, but
among the many sins of which the coileglan is accused,
the least of these is maturity. We know of no critic
who has taken it upon himself to boldly claim that the
college student is wise beyond his years, in matters
other than those he shouldn't know,

When it comes to matters of sex, of life and the
futility of it all, we ﬁnd the average collegiau a master
of the subjectiif one iS to believe his own words. But
then, our point is not to digress from these somewhat
hackneyed criticisms of the student who peoples the
colleges of today, but to launch our bold blows in the
effort to make him appear to the world as a bit more
grown-up. a bit more mature, if you please.

We do not venture an opinion as to the worth of our
blows, nor of their consequent telling quality, but we do
hold with modest might the worth of the effort.

At one time the collegian wore a distinctive garb,7
an underslung pipe, a loud hat band, peg top trousers
and a pennant. Now—these have gone the way with the
beer that students of yesterday was fabled to consume,
One cannot distinguish the college man and woman of
today from the rest of the world, for the world, sad
to relate has gone collegiate. College clothes and man-
ners are looked upon as a criteria of good dress, of
fashion makers,

The college man of today cannot be discovered
merely because he wears funny clothes, but, and here
is the object of our timely words, he can be distinguished
by his child-like eagerness and propensity for childish
play,

You would perhaps grasp with honest amazement
were we to tell you that. on a certain campus lawn we
gazed on the Sad sight of some number of college men
and women playingitag. Yes indeed, just old simple
tag. The reckless abandon of the players belied their
some three years under the sobering inluence of a col-
lege education. The carefree leaps and the adolescent
giggles and laughs of the players caused us to pause
and wonder if it was worth all the money it cost after
all.

Men may brag that they are still boys at heart and
all that sort of rot, but. we frankly think they are a
bit coo-cuckoo, that they are traveling incognito as it
were. We, in the interest of the world and in the future
of the race make here our stand for a bit more mature
type of college student, one who at least bears the pre-
tense of having a grain of equilibrium.

As a matter of fact we are irked and tired of the
whole business and wish to save the world from any
such blight as might be drawn from a repetition of the
world adopting college styles in clothing . . . wouldn’t it
be a terrible thing for the astute members of the local
bank to become engrossed in a game of one-o-Cat, as
to stop trafﬁc on Main street.

DORMITORY REGULATIONS
(From the Oberlin Review)

Dormitories for college men always provide a sore
problem to a non-fraternity campus. Where most of the
men must be housed in private establishments, friction
often results between the college authorities and private
owners. The fact that Oberlin has been remarkably free
from such friction is a basis for commending the college
committee in charge of dormitories,

The recent legislation of that committee to raise
the standards of private rooming houses is equally com»
meudable. The decision to set the standard price for
rooms in private houses somewhat above the existing
average price there. but equal to the price in college
dormitories, may bear some question.

Cood rooms which meet the new regulations, are
now available at prices below the new standard.

The action of the committee did not come because
of complaints by private house operators, but was the
result of a feeling among the members of the committee
that the new requirements they were making would
necessitate increased prices.

Arbitrary price ﬁxation reduces competition. If
private house operators are able to meet the require-
ments at a price lower than the new standard price,
the result would mean a saving to students. It. need
not he stated that the inerests of sudents are uppera
most in the minds of the committee.

If the new requirements do exert a hardship upon
the operators of private houses, they should be allowed
to bring complaint. Until they do, it should be the duty
of the college committee on dormitories to arrange for
rooms for 'ts college men at the lowest prices possible.
Arbitrary price fixation means handing a lump sum to
the private house operators, in many cases, and this
added amount will come from the individual students.

if. as has been intimated variously, collegerowned
dormitories go vacant because of high prices, which
means that the college cannot operate dormitories as
cheaply as can private owners, then students ought to
be allowed to beneﬁt from the saving.

Private houses ought; to be allowed to meet the
college regulations at their own prices, with open and
free competition, which will result in ﬁnal saving to the
individual student, unle. it can definitely be shown
that the standards of private houses are actually lower
and more detrimental to student welfare than those
of college dormitories.

l Campus Opinion
Sllﬂllld women lure the same prh'r
ilegcs in regard to having cars on
the campus tlint men are given?
Gludys Bradley: Yes, I think they‘
Should. If women are lucky enough to‘
have cars, they should have equal;

rights with men in regard to that
matter.

Frederick Graﬂuiid: Sure, I thinkl
they should be permitted to have cars,
The men do not have strict hours like
the women have, and therefore it‘
should be harder for them to get their
lessons, but they are given the right
to have cais. Surely with the strict
hours the girls have they should be
allowed to have cars.

John Wiley: Sure, women are just
as able to take care of cars as the
fellows are.

Ruth Bender: Surely, women are
men's equal. Why not allow them
equality in the matter of keeping ears
here?

Milton Holloway: Yes. women
should be allowed cars. A good Worn—
an driver is as good as a man driver
any day. I said good driver.

Question: Should fresiuriaii women
be housed with upperclass students?

i-iiirold Forrester: Absolutely no:
How could freshmen exist for a whole
year without the use of Mears' ﬁre
escape?

Eleanor Weeks: Yes, it would be a
good idea, because it would tend to
do away with the class distinctions
and make for a greater unity among
the girls.

Jiuie Carlson. No, because tt would
disrupt the freshmen's study habits.

.ioe Pojmau: Yes. The freshmen
girls are apt to make the upperclass
girls set a better example.

Mildred anan: No. Why change a
good old oriunell tradition?

Gordon nosecrnns: By living to-
gether as freshmen, they make ac-
quaintances which they can keep up
throughout their four years of col~
lege,

Betty Guild: Yes, more prepping
could be done. .

Marion Brown: There would not be
so much disturbance at the end of
the year, caused by girls having to
move to a different cottage.

I love Richard ives—and for six

Now my happiness is threatened
because he insists I marry him. l

In our set marriage is only the
prelude to separation and divorce.
I want to love Richard forever. 1
want to cling to romance as long
as I can.

Richard says he will break our
engagement if I don’t marry him—
bccaiise people are begiiuiing to

petty gossip? if i marry him and
lose his love, it will be I, not they,
who will suffer.
