Drake Seeks
Final 1929 Drive

of Pioneers

to Revenge

By LEIG‘HTON HOUSH

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)
DES MOINEsiDreke wants Coach
Lester watt and his Grinnell team
this year in the very worst way!
, And what’s more the Missouri Val-
ley conference cochampions mean to
. take the Pioneers
to one of the worst
1 ings ever ad-
ministered during
the long gridiron
relationship
between the two
Iowa schools.
Reasons for this
attitude are mani-
fold, but the chief
one is the 1929 struggle which ended
in a moral victory for the Pioneers
after one of the most brilliant games
ever played in tbe Drake’stadlum,

Grinnell's Last Quarter Drive,

Few spectators who watched the
contest will ever forget it. They
remember how Drake, outplaying the
invaders by a comfortable margin,
pushed over a touchdown and held
the advantage for most of the game.

But uppermost in their minds is
that last-quarter drive of Griunell's
which rolled back a. tiring Drake line
to knot the count. Then, unsatisfied,
the scarlet-jerseyed wave'was soon
knockingcn the door of a sweet vic-
tory. Only a fumble, recovered by a
Drake lineman during the last minute
of play on the Bulldog 1—yard mark,
prevented Crinnell from humbling the
conference cochampions.

Again the ‘Onkell Buckev

'The squirting of the elusive pigskin

from the unfortunate Grinnell half-
back’s arms saved_Drake.from being

forced to surrender the ancient trophy
the old
oaken bucket which the winning

or Grinnell»Dra.ke conflict,

school keeps each year.
The Bulldogs, because of their 19 to

Moines stadium Drake means to rev

claim it in a convincing manner. which

will leave no doubt as to the rightful

owner for the ensuing 12 months.
\l'ntl au Ael'illl \l'inrd

Whether they succeed or not is
problematicul. In the opening game
of the season Drake, after a bitter-
struggle, lost a night tilt to Coach
Clarence \v. "Fat" Spear's Orcgon
team, I‘l to 7. But Coach VVtitt’s Plo-
neers also suffered deieat at the
hands of Marquette by a Sillglerloucll-
down margin after having repulsed
the Hilltoppers' drives on six differ-
ent occasions.

The I930 Grlnuelerrake battle
promises to he even more spectacular
than last year’s game Drake, usually
a power~bouse machine, uncorked a
brilliant passing attack against the
Pacific coast eleven at Chicago. Watt-
coached teams are respected through-
out the entire middlewest for their
mastery of aerial tactics. With Ruff
back tossing the leather, Grinnell is
always dangerous.

Regular Guard Out.

Drake prospects for a successful
season received a setback following
the Oregon game when it became
known that Bob Risser, regular guard,
would be lost for the entire season be-
cause of a bad shoulder. This leaves
the guard positions to Francis Sullir
van, a letter-winner at Northwestern
two years ago, and Milo Bowers, a
lee-pound player who lacks only ex-
pcrience,

Waldo Don Carlos, who was Selects
ed on the Notre Dame all-opponents
eleven in 1929, will again handle the
pivot position. At the tackles Drake
has two sophomore behemoths who
have supplied the weight on the for-
ward wall which was missing last
year. They are Milton Kokjohn and
Fred Blanck. Kokjohn weighs 203,
while his partner tips the scales at
210 ,
King at Quarter
John Briley, one of the 14 veterans

will play one end while either Paul
Olson, maderovcr tackle, or Adolph
Hallgrcn will be seen at the other
wing position.

Barking out signals at his quartcn
back berth will be Capt. Lynn King,
the “mighty atom" of midwcstorn
football. Ring, weighing 153, has
been a conference selection for two
years in addition to leading the loop
in scoring. He is known as one of the
flashiest open field runners in' the
country. ‘

“Cllllclt"Vall Kolcn, llardrhitting
line smasher, will pair With Chris
Ivcrson, a beautiful blocker, at tho
halfback positions. Fullback will be

filled either by Gerald Seiberlihg, 1954
pound player who lettered in 1928, or-
Wilton Brewer, another veteran.

N‘ov. 14.15 Definitely Set
as Date for Convention of
High School Writers Here

The weekend of Nov. 14 has been
dehnitely set as the date forrtbe
Iowa High School Press association
convention, which will be held in
Grinnell tor the eleventh consecutive
year. The convention is under the
auspices of Theta Sigma Phi and Sig—
ma Delta Chi, Grlhnell’s honorary
journalistic fraternities.

S everal preliminary committee
meetings have been held to work on
the selection of speakers, notifying
members of the convention dates, and
pl‘dl’lning entertainment.

Member schools are allowed a def-
inite number of delegates with vot-
ing power, but visitors are welcome
to the conferences. last year there
were approximately 240 delegates and
visitors in attendance, and it is hoped
that this number will be considerably
increased in the coming meet.
