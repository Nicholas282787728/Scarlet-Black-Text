Fluke Dash by Hemphill
Gives Reds 6»0 Victory
to Close Spring Football

By the margin of a ﬂuke run. the
Red football team downed the Blacks.
6 to 0, March 26, the last day ot Grin-
nell college's spring grid practice.

The Reds’ lone score came in the
fourth quarter. when Hemphill took
a punt on his 40-yard line and step-
ping over close to the side lino, start-
ed down the ﬁeld. Two Black ends,
thinking he had gone out of bounds,
made no effort to tackle him.

Both elevens, as in the previous
game, lacked the ﬁnal punch to put
the ball over the line after getting
into scoring position.

Fumbles, coming at critical mo-
ments, robbed the Red players or two
sure goals and the Blacks of one.
The passing, while not good, was bet-
ter than in the former conﬂict.
