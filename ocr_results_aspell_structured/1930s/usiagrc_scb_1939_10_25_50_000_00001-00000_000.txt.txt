Lookabaugh Pleased
With Performance
Of Team Saturday

Max Shelton, one of Grinnell‘s
pro-season mainstays, who was
injured and thought out of foot-
ball for good, is returning to the
Pioneer line for the game against
Cornell at Mt. Vernon Saturday.

Shelton's return, plus that of
Robert Hamann, fullback punter
and passer. strengthens the
chances of Crinnell for the rest
of the season.

Barker, oarmody injured.

at the same time, there is a
possibility that Harry Barker,
fullback, whose passing has play-
ed a big part in the last two
games, and Tom Carmody, quar-
terback, may not play against
Cornell as a. result of injuries re
ceived in the Colorado game last
weekend.

“Cornell is going to be rough,
tough, and full of fight, but we
are going to be ready for them,"
said Lcokabaugh.

Knee Injury Improved.

Shelton‘s loss to the team at
the start of the season was cork
sidered a heavy blow. His knee
was injured in practice before the
opening game, and two weeks ago
he announced he would not play
again. Since that time, however,
his injury has responded to treat-
ment to such an extent that he
has returned to the squad and will
play Saturday.

Hamann missed the Colorado
game last Saturday because of
an injured leg.

Colorado Play Outstanding

Although admitting he believes
the return of Shelton and Ha-
mann furnishes Crinnell a promis-
ing chance for victory, Looka-

Lewis Librarian
Irked by Petty ’
Food Samplers

What
most?

“To have the girls go by thc
table eyeing the food on my
tray," stated one of the librarians

irks the Lewis

who remains at the library during'

meal hours.

“I don't mind at all if they
come up to me to say a few
words. In fact, I like that. But
when 1 see them keeping a polite
distance, I know they are watch-
ing every bite I take to see whe-
ther or not the meal is good. I
don't mind giving them a visual
preview of my dinner, but when
it comes to actual sampleSvJ
quit!"

The worst offenders, according
to this librarian, are the upper-
classmen who like to fuss about
everything on the table. “At
times I've felt like asking them
why they must stare at my tray
and make remarks that ruin my
appetite just because the food
may not be to their liking."

But would a Lewis librarian
change her job?

Never! The hours are arranged
for her convenience, the work is
pleasant and there is a chance to
do some studying. Her duties in—
clude the checking out of books,
arranging the library shelves and
keeping them in order, and acting
as hostess to visitors,

Haake, lndustrialist, Attacks Production Curtailménl
And (Soak the Ric/2’ Economic Policies of Government

By William Buckley.

“The stake of labor is seeing
that what is done in its interest
does not harm labor,” Alfred P,
Haakc, managing director of the
National Wholesale Furniture as.
sociation, declared in a lecture
last night held in Herrick chapel.

Haake then went on to explain
that, in his opinion, the weakness
of labor lies in the leadership.
“The labor leaders would try to
keep the rank and file of their
forces from hearing suchaspecch
as I am giving tonight,“ he
claimed.

Many of the policies of the fed
eral government were debunked
by the furniture association ex-
ecutive. In commenting on the
federal program of cutting pro-
duction, Haakc explained, “When
my wife puts less meat and veg—
etables in a stew, then there is
never as much food as there
would be if she put in more in
gredients. If this is the case.
how can cutting production aid

\

labor?”

He decried much of the “take
from the rich, give to the poor"
program set up by the late

Alfred P, Haake
Huey Long. “If you took all the
money away from the people
having an income of $100,000 a
year or mor , every working man

 

 

would receive four cents a day
additional pay.”

Leaving decisions up to federal
boards was condemned by Haake.
“No one who depends on votes
for re-election will ever do the

right thing, if it is contrary to

public opinion." As an example.

Haakc cited the situation in 1928
and 1929, when it was common
memhers of
that

knowledge among-
the federal reserve board
the rcdisccunt rate should he
raised, or a crash would be inevir
table.

"Labor is better off relying on
collective bargaining,” he said.

To remedy the Current labor
situation, Haake suggested passing
decreased production Costs back
to the consumer, instead of pass—
ing them out in dividends or by
means of more production or in
the form of higher wages, If this
were the case, “the worker would
lie able to buy more for his
money, thereby constituting a
raise in wages."
