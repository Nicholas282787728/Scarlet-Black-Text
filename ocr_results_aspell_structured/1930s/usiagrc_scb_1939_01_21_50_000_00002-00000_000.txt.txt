To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

Gi'ilinell College, instead of
“slipping," is vigorously moving
ahead, according to records in
the treasurers office The recent
editorial in the Scarlet and Black
and open forum letters caused us
to investigate and compare the
physical condition of our plant
with that of eight years ago.

We can honestly say there has
been a steady improvement dur»
ing this period.

These years have seen added
to the facilities of the campus
the followmg larger items costing
approximately $93,000; quadran-
gle, Pine Tree place and dormi-
tory alterations together with the
addition of Carney and Macy
houses, which furnished housing
for 110 additional students; flir—
nishing for these Increased hous—
ing facilities and complete new
furnishings for the quadrangle
main floor parlors and for eight
Club rooms; the addition of Steam
control equipment and improve
ment of heat tunnels accompan—
led by greatly improved heating
conditions; new lighting for the
library, the art department, Blair

improved lighting and revamping
of the interior of the men's gym»
nasium‘, the addition of an elecs
tric scorc hoard, a comfortable
press box, a new quartersmlle
track at the athletic field ani
two fine hand ball coin-ts; lms
proved recreation rooms in the

'ngle and dorms With the
add ion of the White House as
a student center.

More recently 14 first class
music practice rooms have been
lari-angcd and a band room h s
been sound-proofed. Smallci-
pl'ovt-‘ments have made living con—
ditions for students more comfo »
able; namely, weather stripping
of windows at the dormitories,
shaving lights for men, closet
lights for women with current for
radios and extra lights at no exV
tra charge to the student and best
of all, an increased hot water
supply.

A central post office has been
added to the Bookstore, and the
drama work shop is now heated.
All the above mentioned improve»
merits have not just happened.
They are the results of the at»
forts of the administration and
while not spectacular, they do
repiesent steady growth.

With a student body varying

from approximately .347 in 1934
lo 800 in 1938, the stat: has barn
paid promptly and regularly and
at present our salary scale is
second from the top in a come
parisoii recently made among mid-
dlc wcstei-ii colleges,

With Such a VallRl—lol’l ln “1-
come from student accounts, and
from endowment funds through
lthesc uncertain years, the treas-
urers officc has had many (liffk
cult financial problems.

Operating deficits have Consists
ently decreased since 1931, and
for the past three fiscal years
they have been wiped out, The
president's home has been is so-
cial center for stud: raculty
and town groups. Tli, adminis-
tration, presumably, has worked
in harmony to accomplisi Lhe‘e
ends.

It is true that we need a new
art center, a science building, a
union, a field house, and added
icntlowment. Grinnell college will
always have needs because it is
la growing, expanding institution
with an ever widening circle of
friends. Alumni, students and fac-
ility should strive for cooperation
and harmony,

if any group or individual has
a just complaint why not go di-

 

hail and campus together With

m POSITION

In one of the letters to the editor last week,
it was intimated that the editorial which
appeared ill the Jail. 7 issue of the Scarlet
and Black was printed in retaliation for the
defeat of the financial plan for reorganiza-
tion of college publications.

This newspaper did support the publica—
tions plan, bill: we have never said that it
was the only possibility for illlprovcmellt
of college publications. The proposal was
merely supported as the plan which the stue
dents themselves drew up through the med—
ium of the Student Council, campus govern-
ing body, It is true that the pl‘OpOSﬂl'S de-
feat offered an excuse for commenting on
a situation which has been under student
and alumni discussion for the past two
years, but the Sci t and Black’s present
editorial policy can in no way be considered
as a repl'isal or as a retaliatory measurei

Even our most active critics, if they can
appreciate at all the since ty of our pure
pose, cannot help but see this point. We do
not ask for physical or material change,

for only too well do we realize and ilpp'
ciale the desire of authorities to provide
Gl‘ll‘lnell with the necessary buildings find
equipment to make our college great,

A college is not built entirely, or even in
its major part, by sticks and stones A cole
lege is built by all active, spirited student
body which is willing and unafraid to take
whatever steps it thinks necessary for the
betterment of the school it lids come to
love and respect; a college is built by a pro-
grcssive faculty and adlllillistrzltion which
will recognize the importance of intimate
and coopcl'atl 'e relations with the student
body and which will spread good will for
the college throughout the land.

Alumni, friends of the college and stu—
dents have stated their views to the Scarlet
«1ch Black, these people knowing that in the
campus newspaper lies the bulwark of
opinion. Our lOVe of Griilllell has made us
respond!

SCHOOL CALENTAR ‘1

Last week next year’s calcilddl- was brought
up before the faculty meeting Sincel
Thanksgiving Day comes on Nov. 29, neces—
sitating 01in a two-week intervention be
tween Thanksgiving vacation and Christ-
mas vacation, the faculty brought up a plan
to change [his set-up,

According to the calendar, Thanksgiving
vacation will begin Wednesday noon, No»
vcmbei‘ 28, and will end quddy morning,
December 3, while Christmas vacation will
start Wednesday noon, December 20, and
will eliil Wednesday morning, January 3.
The facility suggested that the Thaliksgiv»
lug vacation be eliminated, and the extra
days be added to the Christmas vacationi
Consequently, though there would be no
school Thanksgiving Day, tliel'e \i'uuld be
on F 'day. Christmas vacation would
start Friday afternoon, December 15.

This plan would be especially advantage-
ous to students who live some distance from
Gl‘innell, and are unable to make the trip
home during the short Thanksgiving vaca—
tioni Since there would be no classes
Thanksgiving Day, this clay coultl be de-
voted to student activities.

. Two years ago somewhat the same Situa-

tion arose, and the students circulated pe-
titions ill wliicll they tried to bring about
Just such a plan, but the calendar had al-
ready been placed on the college bulletin
and could not be changed.

If the students want such a plan next
year, they must act now, fol" the college
bulletins must be printed this spring so it
will be llseless to wait until next fall to

rcctiy to the peison
bororc broadcasting to the world
that Crinncil is slipping? Certain-
ly, large gifts will not come to
an institution so advertised.

ciinncll college is greater than
any one person, and it is an honor
to belong to her administration,
hci- faculty, her alumni or her
student hotly.

Grinnell gocs ahead and looks
to the future With confidence.

Treasurer.

To the Editoi of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear M'. Rowley:

Your editorial in the Jan. 7 is-
sue 1 have just read with the
deepest interest, and my one re-
gret is that it is undoubtedly
impossible for a reprint of the
same to be placed in the hands
of each of the alumni.

in June, 1937, I attended the
twelitysﬁfth reunion of my class,
and during my short visit I
seemed to sense a change in the
typical old Crinneli atmosphere.
1 dismissed it the best I could,
thinking that the years had pel's
naps wrought a change in me in-
stead,

I spent a day there last Mari-h,
and again I became conscious of
a different and I confess a weale
er Crinnell.

1 havopaid two brief visits
there since last septcmhnr, and
each time my reaction has been
the same.

There seems to be an intangible
something that is WtO'lg ivith
Grinnell. 1 have talked wi,h other
alumni and am shocked to learn
that they experience the same
feeling.

1 am not close enough to the
situation to offer my comments
pertinent to the case, but I do
know that when a husincs nsti-
tution begins to sag it usually is
the fault of either the dirUCLOrzi
or the management and men
times both,

May 1 ask if a collage rich in
tradition and past accomplish
inents is any different than an
old established busin a with a

,firm and enviable background?

Continuing the analogy further,
a business does not progress or
prosper in this day anl age by
smiigly resting on its past repu-
tation, That is what i mink
Crinneil is doing.

It is necessary today not only
to make a good product but to
go out and promote it with Cli-
ergy, intelligence and up to te
methods, but with the dignity of
it’s past 1 do not believe Gl'il'i~
neu is doing this.

There is no question but fin-
ances have a great effect on the
activities of any i '
However, Grinnell has r d
thousands of dollars in thc past,
and there is no reason that w’ h
proper organization and person-
nel she can not repeat.

For example, look at our
neighbor coinell colleg she has
emerged from the {lelll'issﬂni with
at least three new buildings and
a progressive program.

It is my feeling that, from an
athletic standpoint, we have bct~
tered ourselves in affiliatiiig who
the Mid-West Conference where
we should rank at the top with
schools of our class and en ‘i‘ls
mcnt.

This appears to be a step foi»
waid, anti the publicity given
the change seems :0 have “set
well" with the public; but where
is all the favorable piitlicity we
used to enjoy from tho scholastic
and musical accoino shnient‘?
Have we ceased to accomplish

Before 1 close 1 \le’ll to take
the opportunity to express my
picasiiro in reading your many
good editorials this year. You -irc

 

Start such a campaign. What do you want?

to be commended for them, and

conccrncdlit leads one to hclievv, that Grin—

men is still able to produce

since my gradiialioi from
Giiunell, 1 have cheri J(‘tl with
the greatest pi-idc the fan. that
I am an aiunius of the school ,and
my sincerest wish is that each
year in the future 1 will be ahic
to point with greater pridc if)
my aimaematel‘.

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr, Rowley:

We “Ginnell sheep" owe a
debt of gratitude to Mr. Lee Mo
intosh for his letter of last
Wednesday. Blind, deaf and dumb
as we are, he showed us the deep
and desperate plot behind the edi-
torial, “Is ci-iniicll Slipping?"

We erringly voted in favor of
a publication plan that was
thrown as “banana skins" iindcr
our unsuspecting feet, Consee
duciitly, we’re now all dupes of
’thc sinister scheme.

I fear, however, that like some
who prefer “banana skins," others
relish sour gr pesi

The roinanticists who suggested
economy as a substitute for the
lost publication plan would un-
doiibtedly like to see the Scarlet
and Black emerging from a
mimeograph machine once a
week.

Progress most certainly appears
in many odd shapes and sizes}

—J.M.

To the Editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Dear Mr. Rowley:

We who are proud of our school
are very anxious that Crinnell
continue to be known for its pro-
gressive spirit and leadership as
it has been in the past. We want
it to be an intrinsically valuable
educational center, not just an-
other scliool mill. We want it to
forge ahead in all that proves
wortliwhlie and to improve those
traditions proved good by the test
of years

If our school is to do this, it
will takc more careful planning
and cooperation on the part of the
student, faculty, and administra-
tion than there has been during
recent years.

—Peggy Arnold.
