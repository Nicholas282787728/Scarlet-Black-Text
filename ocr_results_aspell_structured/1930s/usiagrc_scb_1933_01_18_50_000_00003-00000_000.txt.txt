‘college, or because of something cone

neeted with the essential altruism of
their profession, the truth remains
that those who make teaching their
life work do not come to Sing Sing.

the majority of crimes for which col—

those. in the case of nonecollege men,
declares Anthony N. Petersen, Pro»
testant chaplain of the prison. Col-
lege prisoners commit larceny three
times as frequently as others; forg-

very rare is the prisoner who has
worked his way through college, dee
clares Chaplain Peterson in an angle
ysis in Redbook for February:
Best liirouri Colleges Represented
“Alumni of the besteknown cal-
lcgcs and universities (including my
own) share prison tasks with men
whose mentality is that of a little
child, under-privileged boys who have
never been taught to read and write
and fol'elgilel's who cannot speak in-

heligrble English: The son of one of,

the leading educators in America has

make such a failure of life that they
have to he shot up behind the bars?
A college man now at Sing Sing is
inclined to lay the blame on social
and economic conditions. He says
that in periods of financial depress
ion the proportion of highly educated
riien who are in prison should be ex-
pected to increase, because, in the
first place, a depression hits earliest
and hardest those who are holding
Willte~collar jobs, and in the second
place, these men are used to living
better and more expensively than
laborer-s or mechanics, ‘aud so, when
the crisis comes, they are less able
and willing to adapt themselves to
a lower scale of living. I have not

yet been able to get any statistical »

check on this theory; but as far as
it goes, it sounds plausible.
Not Murder

“College men are seldom convicted
of offenses where either force or m-
timidation is involved, or even ex-
treme physical exertion. They are
not likely to become human flies, or
cat burglars or safe»blowers, or hold-
up meh or racketeers, or kidnappers,
or mallvcoach robbers. They are not

addicted to the crime passinneli It is

“When s college glee-club or choir
sings here, there is almost certain

to be an alumni reunion with at least[

one man who wears the prison gray.
Sing Sing Culture

"The, intellectual atmosphere of
Sing Sing is far more cultured than
most people suppose. Among the ins
mates are experts in history, liter-
ature. journalism, philosophy, com—
parative philology, science and relig~

ion. We have collegeetralned lawyers'

who usually are glad to give their ad-
vice to the other prisoners, and doc-
tors who informally prescribe for
minor ailments of their fellowein-
mates. We once had an unfrocked

clergyman; a brilliant scholar he was’

too.

“One of these highly educated .men
said to me: ‘Chaplain, you don’t class
the with the rest of the‘ prinoners
here, do you? ‘No,’ I answered, '1

place you far below them. They did‘

not have your training, your oppor-
tunities, your general background; So
I consider that you are much more
to be condemned than these other
poor fellows who never had the
chance in life that you did,’
‘Seldom Show Condeit’

”It is seldom, however, that our

college men show such a conceited

spirit. 0n the contrary, they seem tol

feel the‘ disgrace of their conviction
and imprisonment more intensely
than any other group of inmatﬁ. ’

“Usually, too, they think back of
the punishment to the crime for
which it was inflicted. But however
much a highly educated man may
feel the disgrace of imprisonment and
shrink from the associations of prison

‘ life, his superior intelligence prompts
him to accept quietly the exigencies
of his new situation, and as a rule
our college men are model prisoners.
In fact, disciplinary measures among
them are practically unknown.

‘Coilcge Trained Exputs’

“For economy of prison adminis-
tration, among other reasons, they
are not often put to such menial
tasks as sweeping up refuse, but are
assigned work for which their prev~
ious training especially fits them. So
they are to he found in the prison
library, or doing clerical or secretar—
ial work in our many offices. The
present chief clerk in the central of»
fice is a college-trained expert ac-

. countant who turned to forgery.
other college men work in our well-
equipped hospital wards, or in our
clinics and laboratories. Many of the
instructors in the school are also col-
lege meniamong whom is one of the
most remarkable teachers I have ever
known; and many others are assign-
ed as advisers to the inmates who
are taking advanced studies through
correspondence courses.

No college Professors

"To the best of my knowledge, we
haVe not had any school-teachers or
college professors among our prison-
ers. Whether- this is because such

‘very rarely that, for any cause what-

ever, they commit murder. Since I

came to Sing Sing seventeen years

ago. only one college man has been
ctrocuted.

"As compared with the present in—
mates of Sing Sing who have only
attended high school, the prisoners
who have attended college have, in
proportion to their total number,
committed only one—eighth as many
robberies (Tobbely being a crime that
involves personal violence or the

.thrcat of violence), but they have

committed three times as many laiul
cables. The typical college mzlJl’l-‘
crime is taking money that due, not,
belong to him, while the owner is noll
watching, and doing this in what;
- ems the c’"lest and safest way. ;

Of all names, college men n,‘
most addicted to forgery. In view of:
the fact that this is one of the ads
icst crimes to detect, and also one of'
the easiest on which to obtain a cori-
viction their partinhty to it would
seem to support the contention of
the prisoner who doubts whether, of
tar all, one gets an education in col—
lege.

“I cannot recall that I ever talked
with a prisoner here who had worked
his way through college."

,Editor. The Scarlet and Black

Dear Sir:

Where is Grinncll’s student talent.7
Who should be benefiting by the ex-
perience of taking parts in Grlnucll’s
opcrcttas, plays mld musical rcclt s:
the students or the faculty members?

Are the students or Grinnell pos-
seesed of so little talent that three of
the leading inairi roles of the Mikado,
and ‘lle tliiet parts in all vespcr re-
citals, have to be taken by faculty
members, and that the string quare
tette and the singing quartettc cone
thin but oao student member apiece?

Surely this can hardly be the case.
Of course one must readily admit
that the newly members are excels
lent musicians and dramatists, per-
1 s over. better than any student,
but that is not the ques on. are not
the students instead of the profess-
ors the ones who need the experience
gained by partaking in Grinnell’s prev
auctions?

'nnell co=lege is represented only
by its students in its athletic teams,
debating teams rind most of its jour-
nalistic staffs. Why should the school
he represented by faculty members in
the field of music and dramatics?

What do people expect to see and
hear when attending a comic opera
or recital produced by Gn'nllell'!
Surely not an expert and flawless
presentation by experienced and well
trained professors but rather a very
good; perhaps a little amateurelikc
performance by the students of these
professors.

it is no feather in a professor‘s cap
to perform like a professional musi-

cian or actor because it is taken for
granted that the faculty members
are e. rts in their particular line
of teaching; but it is a real nch e-
incht for an instructor to turn out
a 'student to fill such a part success-
fully.

That, one may conclude, is at
the faculty members should st ve to,
attain instead of taking most of the
leading parts for themselves as theyl
have been doing during the recent
years.‘
