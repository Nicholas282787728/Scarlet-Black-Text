So greatly Ilm'c appetites and in.

it has been thought well to install a
giant corn popping nmchine. The
community plan has proved sucha
vast improvement that the policy
will he continued in the futin-e.
Guests are invited to drop in any eve-

So important is this year's fresh—
man class that three young inno-
cents demanded that one ,of our
stores should be opened on Sunday
in order that they might have cand—
les for their birthday cake.

And then tileré ii the sad case
of the freshmen who tripped up
to the faculty table and asked
\Vllethel‘ our deal: of women “'ZIS
reserving the extra places.

In the future it \\"lll be unnecessary
for picnickers to wend their weary
way to Sugar Creek. The college has
kindly installed green benches and
tables directly in front of Rand gym-
nasillm. Exhibitions Will be held at
intervals to demonstrate the correct
procedure at such functions.

The Freshmen have at last re-

they have been clamoring for so
loudly.

Maybe, by now, they know what
was meant when they were told
to "drop everything" when they
heard one of “ﬂielr frirmds and

Makes Correction
in Saturday Story

Eleven members and two alter»
Hates were elected to the men's glee
club after tryouts in Herrick chapel
last Tuesday and Wednesday even-
ings. The present personnel of the
club was present for the two tryouts,
which were in charge of Prof. David
E, Peck instructor of violin in the
Grinnell School of Music and director
of the glee club.

Alternates were elected for the
first tenor and second tenor sections.
Three men were elected to vacancies
caused by graduation in the ﬁrst dia
vision, four in the second tenor, and
four in the baritone.

Fred Obi, Franklin st. John, and
Mason Meyer are new tenors, with
Theodore McGee as alternate. New
second tenors are James Morrison,
Albert Rose, Robinson Shoulberg, and
Paul Crawford, and Vincent Saurino
is alternate. Those elected to the
baritone division are Howard War-
rington, Everett Curtis. Sidney John-
Son. and Robert McCree.

The Scarlet and Black story of
Saturday was in error, and the paper
is glad to make this correction to~
day.

Edmund Morrison, elf-'31, a stud—
ent in the law school at the Univer—
sity of Iowa, stopped in Grinnell for
dinner last night while on his way
from Iowa City to Des Memes.

Edward Brown and Carroll Dewey,
graduates of last year’s class, have
entered the training school of the
John Morrell Packing company at
Sioux Falls, S. D.

Because the Hilltoppers' next four
games are on Friday nights, except
Creighton at Omaha on Saturday
night, Oct. 18, Coach Murray has dc-
cided that Saturday will be a rest
day for the Avalanche boys, and
workouts will be held on Sundays.
The ﬁrst Sunday session occurred
this week and found Murray conduct-

Walker Will Play
Against Marquette

There are two games on the seller
dule that Grinneli wants to win, Mar—
quette is one and Drake is the other.
With the Marquette game coming up
this Friday night, Coach Lester Watt
has been driving his men hard and
the squad has found itself better by
two hard scrimmages.

Walker, who did not see action in
the Iowa Wesleyan game on account
of injuries, is back in uniform, though

Marquette Practices Passing
Grinnell has had the better of Mar—
quette for the last two Séasons, but
the game this Friday night looks
like an even chance for both teams.
The glowing reports to the effect
that Grinuell's aerial attack this year
is fully as good as last year when it
defeated Marquette, have made the
Hilltoppers determined to use the
passing game as a collnter»:tttdck
against the Pioneers, if reports from
Milwaukee are true.
