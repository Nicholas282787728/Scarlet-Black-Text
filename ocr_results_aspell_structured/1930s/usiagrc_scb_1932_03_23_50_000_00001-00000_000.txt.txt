Encouraged by the efforts of My—

relay team, Coach G. Lester Duke's
Crinnell track squad thrust aside the
dope bucket Saturday to win second
place in die quadrangular track and
field meet at Iowa City with Drake.
Iowa, Grim-1e11, and Iowa state pare
ticipating.

Expected to finish at the bottom of
the heap, members of the team sur-
prised a large crowd to walk off with
the lion's share of the honors. With
the exception of Captain George Sal-
ing of Iowa. who garnered 17 points.
Crinnell men dominated the meet
thruout.

lt was the Pioneer milerclay quote
tct that furnished the biggest upset
of the evening to beat out the Hawk-
eyes and cstabl'h a new fieldhousc
record of 3:234. Once again, the
Grinnell team got off to a poor start.
but a fast quarter by Alexander put
the Pioneers back in thc running ads
tho they were still last when

 

 

Murphy took the baton.

Thc Grinnell (co-captain brought.
the crowd to its rcct by forging ahead
of the Drake and Iowa State runners
and into a tie with Nugnis. the
Hawkcyc star. Thomas, running
anchor for Crinnell. broke the tape
five yards ahead of Dean, Iowa's
crack quarter-miler. ‘

The Pioneers took four firsts giVe
ing thorn enough points to nose out
Drake, who was favored to win the
meet. Pilbrow and Pfeiffcr finishcd
one-two in thc twanmile run, while
this pair combined with Barber to
give Crinncll victory in the mile
team race.

Clarence (Snap) James camc
thru with another big upset when
he lcapcd 21 feet 7 inches to annex
the broad jump, and give Crinncll its
margin of victory over Drake. Alex-
ander took second place in the 70-
yard dash. and ran a great race to
give Grinnell second in the halfmilc
relay, after Iowa was disqualified,

Lyle Chapman cracked anothcr
fieldhouse record when he broke the
tape in 4:21;; in the mile run to clip
a second off thc previous record held
by Martin of Purdue. Pilbrow and
Pfeiffcr pushed him all the way, and
it took a desperate sprint to stave
off Pilbrow's challenge at the finish.
