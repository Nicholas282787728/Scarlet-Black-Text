'Hell Week'
Disconiinued

Lack of Convenient

Date Moves Council
To Abolish Prepping

There will he no spring "hell
week” for freshman men this
year.

Temporary abolishment of the
traditionai “improvement. days”
was decided upon at a special
meeting of the Council of House
Presidents Monday night, Paul
Carlson, president of the group,
said today.

“The principal reason for this
decision was the fact that there
is not an available date that
would not conflict with too many
other activities.n Carlson said.

“We also feel,” he continued.
“that the house officers of the
past year have done so well in
the matter of freshman discipline
that there would be no justificaa
tion for improvement days' at
this time."

“We are not neccssarily going
on record as disfavoring spring
prepping for all time but we be
lieve that to do so this year will
he better for everyone concerned"
he said.
