man writing the best song for his
class and for the college, an—
nounced today that he would ex-
tend thc date of the contest to
May.

All entries must be in at that
time, Dr. Steiner said,

The prize is being given, he
asserted, to maintain the enthuss
iasm of the freshman class and to
stimulate class cooperation, pre~
serving the spiritual and social
values inherent in the Grinnell
spirit.

Conditions of the award, which
were first announced by Dr,
Steiner last October, are:

1, Only freshmen are elegible
to participate in the competition

2, The song should be of such
a nature as to inspire college
loyalty and class unity.

3, It should be no less than

Six verses in length, and no more‘

than eight,
4. Its context should make it
possible to be sung to some dig-

nified but simple tune, preferablyl
if

an original composition, but
not, the tune to which it is to
be sung should be indicated,
Should the writer of the song al-
so compose the inusic, the prize
will be 530 instead of 525,

5 There is no objection to co-
laberation, in which case the $30
will be equally divided between
the two contestants.

6, The manuscript must be
typewritten and sent to the fresh
man song committee, in care of
Dr. Steiner, before May 1, 1933.

Dr Steiner said he plans to

offer this award each year so that]

supply of new song

Lose Second Conference
Tilt to Drake Cagers,
30-26.

The Pioneer basketball team,
displaying smoother passing, and
greater coolness under fire, were
way off on their basket shooting
last night and went down before
Drake university in a typical hair-
raiser by a 30-26 score.

For the first time this year the
Pioneers displayed the ability to
work into the basket for close
shots, but inability to hit on
set-ups and tip—ins deprived the
boys of more than enough points
to win.

Second Loss.

It was the second conference
loss for the Pioneers this year,
and puts them in third place,
trailing Drake and Tulsa.

The fist half was largely a
rotlgheandetumble battle with
most of both teams on the floor
a good share of the time. Neither
team was able to get much of
an advantage until just before the
rest period when, with the Bull-
dogs leading 11-10, Miletich got

a
turn shot from center to make
the score 14-10 at halftime.

Inst Half,

The last halt was just as
screwy as any ball game could
he, Drake started out to pile
up a big total, and in six minutes
Norris and Suttcr had run their
lead to 20—10, Then Wilbur Luick
started to lead a comeback by
ramming in a bucket,

In the next 14 minutes, the
Pioneers outscored Drake 16—10,
but Berry, Turned and Luther
all contributing points to the
Pioncei- total, but Drake matched
the d to and held the score with
ax minutes to go at 27719.

Dean made a free throw, but
Norris of Drake went one better
with a quick field goal. Drake
began to get a little jittery and
the Pioneers put on more heat.
