MORE FIGUREHEADS

Well, the perennial matter of electing class
officers has been disposed of this year with
unusual rapidity In fact each of the classes
had to call but one meeting and then succeeded
in electing officers. A new record for the
campus, upsetting the tradition of many meet-
lugs.

However, the fact that the officers were
elected with more rapidity this time docs not
mean that they will be any more useful. Quite
the contrary they will Still be the same excel-
lent figurehcafls, with the president of the class
usually presiding once, and that at a meeting
called to elect his successor

Of what use are class officers anyway?
Nothing as far as we can discover. They hold
office, the college news bureau dutifully sends
to the home town paper the account of their
being elected to this most high office, they,
at least the president does, call tt meeting to
name their own successors and that is the end
of the class officer

Rather all uncxciting role to say the least,
llut year ill and year out the students continue
to elect the dearly beloved officers while other
officials on the campus really attend to the
actual duties. The college social chairman,
who now has charge of the varsity dances,
might well add to his duties the management of
the junior and senior Drums and then there
would not be the least semblance of a reason
for the 91 .tellcc of the class officials.

Why not cease this foolish matter of elect-
ing office , by delegating the lilallagclncnt of
the dances To The competont management of

THE FLIGHT OF AMERICAN “'ORKERS
(Prepared for the Daily Northwestern by the
Staff of the A. c. E.)

After two years which have been featured by
the wishful thinking of many of the country's citi-

, zens. business does now seem to be regaining its

feet, A look at the cold, bare figures showing the
condition of the American worker, however, should
serve to temper the enthusiasm and loose talking
which is an automatic sign of this substantial gain
in prosperity.

Even in 19297ana then workers were able to
purchase so per cent more goods than ill 1921w
there were 16,000,000 families (60 per cent of the
total populationi which possessed incomes below a
standard sufficient to supply the "basic necessit s”
of life On the other hand, 36,000 wealthy families
had a combined income equal to that received by
11,650,000 at the bottom of the economic ladder.
These figures, furnished by the conservative Brook-
ings Institution and not by any advocate of “share-
the-wealth," show that 1/10 of 1 per cent of the
population were receiving as much income as 42
per cent This disparity in income, the Brookings
economists have pointed out in their later and late
est hooks, has made it wholly impossible for pur—
chasing power to keep pace with production.

This shows what has happened since 1923 to
the American worker. Unemployment has decreased,
on the basis of four reliable estimates, only 1,000 -
000. The National Industrial Conference hoard,
purely an employers organization, once estimated
that the average minimum cost for maintaining a
“fair American standard for the family of an in-
dustrial worker” to be $31.92 a week. Average
weekly earnings have never been within $5.00 of this
amount, and during the first few months of 1935,

,they were $11.00 removed from the estimated min-

imum, Though wages rose, living costs rose faster.

it is a lack of space which prevents the inr
clusion of even a few of the many suggestions put
forward to alleviate this condition, It is quite obvi-
ous that the Roosevelt Administration, however sin-
cere its efforts and fine its promises, has done prac-
tically nothing. It is perhaps even more obvious
that the Republicans have to date proposed no plan
which would adequately meet the situation. One can
say with the socialists that there is only one way
cut, but not many will agree with you. One thing
is Certain: the person who can refer to our increaSe
ing business prosperity as the end of all trouble
and the arrival of a new era of social justice, is a
narrow and smug person indeed.

DORIC

(.1 Column ol Pure iienutl‘)

At the north pole dorm resides
a very excellent feminine imper-
Senator who had one frosh very
,worried, before the women‘s var»
isty, calling for a date All
went well until said frosh forgot
the girl's name and called all the
Quad house chairmen to see who
had a date with him, with of
course no results! Then a gal did
call, and shortly afterwards, the
first date (the impersonator)
called ngain. Such popularity, and
what a predicament, two datesi
the only fair thing to do, lie decirL
ed, was to call the second, the real,
date, and break it, Thcn it was
that the big boy had to break down
and confess. To which we answer
tsk. tsk.

 

Morkert, one of the Smith
men, has quite a problem on his
hands. He's been with eight or
nine girls so far this year and
wants to go steady with all of
them. We suggest he put the
names in e hat and drew.

s s s
This matter of enumerating
steadies is a ticklish business,

One day certain couples announce

their intent to do so, and a few

days later we see each half with
someone else, So don’t blame us
for mistakes. However, We don't
think there’s any doubt about Rice
and Hayward going steady and as
for Edwards and the punster

Malum, that's a cinch. There's

some question about Adkins and

Bowen, King and Rushton, White

hey and Adams, Holch and Hirsch,

and Knspheide and Winholtz——but

as for Ellis and Misbachiwell it

 

seems that it isn’t very hard to
forget last year's love at any rate.
And there are is lot of Quddites
who wish MacBl-ide would make up
her mind.
. s n
We wondered how long James
could keep the Montana, .ﬂash
tied down, he’s such it Indies’
mnn. We guess it’s nu over,
nud now the big man claims to
have more “ex’s” than any other
men on the campus. Uh: Huh!
i i 5
And then there was the Dibble
frosh who diligently cleaned up his
room before open house so that he
might take his girl up and show
her his living quarters. She, be.
ing new too, Went right up. Tsk,
says we, but who are the fresh
to know without being told; open
house is just open house to them,
