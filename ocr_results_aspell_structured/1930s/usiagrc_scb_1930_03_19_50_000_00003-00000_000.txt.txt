Little Mary Heldridge, the Pioneer

over night. It seems. dear readers,
as though our little laadie was at a
house party in Des Moines a few
weeks ago, and was dragged into a
continual round of social affairs.
Unaccustorned as Pinkie was to the
fast pace of modern life, he early be-
came fatigued, and was forced to
seek rest on the Mohair. This pic-
ture was snapped at three a. m. Sun-
day morning, just before the little

Harvard Changes

Admission Rule

CAMBRIDGE, MASS. a Grsdnde
ticn from college with distinction will
serve as the criterion for admission
to the l-larvard Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences beginning in Sep
tember. 1930, it was announced at
university hall. The reason for the
change lies primarily in the rapid
increase of enrollment in the gradur
ate school in recent years. The re—
gistration in the school has grown
from 659 in 1922 to 1011 during the
present year.

It is expected that the new require—
ment will be so administered that no
man of sufficient ability will be ex—
cluded. Candidates for admission will
be asked to submit all possible evi—
dence of ﬁtness for graduate stu—
dies.

concensus of opinion that this plan
of recruiting promising seniors 'for
positions is being discontinued, not
only because the supply available is
much larger and companies believe
high-grade men available without
seeking Lhem, but because the com-
panies are trusting to directors of
personnel to direct men to them.”

Further indication of the growth
of the personnel director to import»
ance in the American college was
given by Mr. Dreese, when he quote
ed Mr. K. A. Kennedy, who was
here last week as representative of
the Boeing School of Aeronautics. as
saying that "whereas a few years
ago there were few departments of
pensonnel, today nearly every college
has someone heading up that work."

Mr. Dreese will hold a meeting in
the clubrocm of Smith hall Monday
evening at 6:45 for all men interest-
ed, and will then discuss the co-cp-
eration in establishing of contacts in
Chicago during vacation.
