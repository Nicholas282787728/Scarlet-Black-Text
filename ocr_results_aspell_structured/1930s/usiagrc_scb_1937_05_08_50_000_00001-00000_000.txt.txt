Ballroom, Tap Dancing Are Out—
Lowest Forms in Art of Movement

“Tap dancing has as much rela-
tion to the art of movement as
‘Mlnnie the Moocher‘ has to Beer
lhoven’s Sonata," emphasized Tcd
Shawn, leader and director of the
mens dance, troupe which present»
ed a program in the high school
auditorium last night.

Dressed in a dark business suit.
Shawn dispelled the glamorous
picture in the minds of the two
girl interviewers as he explained
that the repertoire of the Shawn
dancers included all types except
ballroom and tap dancing. The
latter movcmcnt he termed the
lowest form of dancing.

Shawn danced with Ruth St.
Denis for 13 years in the Den
shawn company. He left that com-
pany four years ago ,to expcrir
ment with his life-long desire to
establish a company of men danc-
era.

“1 have always labored," said
Shawn, “against the natural re-

Iaction and cven antagonism at the
idea of men dancers.”

“The experiment has had far
greator success than I had anticlr
pated,” continued Shawn. “We
have danced in every state in the
union."

But he felt that the reception
of foreign companies by the Amel'z
ican public is quite discouraging.
“I've never ceased to marvel at
how any fourth or fifth-rate [hear
trical group with ‘illski' after its
name could have the American
public following them around
with their tongues hanging out.”

Twocthirds of thc audiences be-
fore which the Shawn dancers ap-
pear are college groups

While teaching the art of move-
ment to men interested in physical
education at Springfield, Mo,
Shawn had, as a student, Frank
Luoma, who was instructor in
physical education at Grinnell last
year.

Grade Point
Ratio of 1 .5

FacultyMakes Final Plans
in Meeting Monday;
Marks Decided

Final plans for the new grading
system, which will go into effect
in September, were made Monday
in faculty meeting with the tie
cisiou that a grade point ratio of
1.5 will he required for gradua-
tion, according to Miss Bethana
McCandless, registrar.

The ratio will be effective with
next fall's freshmen. Proportion-
ate adjustment of grade points
wul he made for present students,
Miss McCandless said.

McCandless Explains

“it would hardly be fair to ex-
pect all upperclassmen to have a
1.5 average under the old grading
System,” she explained.

Five passing grades will be in-
cluded in the new marks with
grade points being given for the
first four.

Grades to Be Used

Grades decided upon to be used
in marking will be: H, an honor
grade carrying with it four grade
points; ' superior, three grade
points; ‘B —basic, two gradc
points; ‘F ifair, one grade point,
and ‘P‘apassing, no grade points.

No letter has been decided up-
on to symbolize a fliinking mark.

The new plan is an attempt to
provide a more logical and uni-
fied system of grading and does
not mean that there will be any
more failures than under the pres-
ent system, according to faculty
members.
