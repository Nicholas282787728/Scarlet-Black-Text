Attempt Folly,’

Dean Phelps Calls Women’s
Mass Meeting Monday
in Little Theatre

“I am very much in favor of tlic
idea of Pioneer Prudities but consider
it folly to attempt production this
year," stated Mrs. Sara Sherman
lPi-yor. head Of the dramatic council
in a conference with John G. Wiley,
chairman of the Pruditics committee
from Sigma Delta Chi yestcrrh She
added, “If the Priidit are going to
be given next year, arrangements
must he started this spring."

Mrs. L. v Phelps, dean of women,
has called a mass meeting to be held
in the Little theatre Monday night at
7:00 to obtain the opinions of the ma.
jority of the women concerning the
production of the Pioneer Prudities
ltlus year.

“All Men Finer"

l “All the men students, Dcan Beat-
ty, and the Lantern club favor the
move to produce the Pioneer Prudi-
tics this year," declared John Ram.
sey, president of Sigma Delta Chi, in
an interview today. “The least we can
do is to see this thing through to the
finish according to the men's Wishes,”
he concluded.

Committees from National Colleg-
iate Players and Sigma Delta Chi
will probably meet Sunday afternoon
and draw up plans for the Prudities.
These plans will then go to the dram-
atic council for approval and ar-
rangements made for the date of
production.

Up to council

“If the dramatic council rejects the
proposal to give the Prudities this
year, we will begin work at once on
preparation for the Pruditics next
year. Drawings will be made and the
matter will be placed in the hands
of the individual halls before June,"
Wiley said.

the little dining room Wednesday
evening at 6:15 o'clock.
