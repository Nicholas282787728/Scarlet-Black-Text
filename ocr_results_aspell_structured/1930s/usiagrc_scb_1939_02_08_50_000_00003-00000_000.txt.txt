Smoking for Men, Coeds Against
College Rule in the Gay 90’s

By John Marion.
Class tights, pi throwing sprees,
and rules against smoking and
mixed dancing were some of the
high spots of lite at Grinncll in
the early 1900's.

Since the quadrangle ond dor—
mitories did not exrst, studcn,
lived in town, cating together in
boarding houses, some tor men
only, some for women only, and
a tow for mixed groups

One of them, the Norton club.
tor men only was tamous for its
potatocthl'owlng and pleasliliglng
ﬁghts Atter one of these cllOCoV
late pie rights between two
tables, the curtains and rugs had
to be washed and the room rec
papered.

Smoking Forhiddeu.

Women living in Meal-s cottagc,
then known as the “shack,” gave
dancing parties attended hyladics
only. one wealthy man threw a
mixed dance at the hotel, and
several students were expelled for
attending, i

Smoking for men as well as
for women was forbidden, ,Al—
though the penalty was explilr
sion, some of the men stole out
at night to sit on the old wooden
benches and smoke a stealthy
pipe.

Even putting on her gloves
after leaving the house was a
breach of decorum for a Grinnell
girl in those days. No lady ever
powdered her nose on the street;
in tact, no lady ever powdered
her nose. They were taught' se-
date, propcr conversation.
