Merchants, Have

Men Collect 35,000
Pennies in Drive

"Penny, penny, who's got the
penny?” That was the song
of Grinncll merchants Saturday

Behind their question hangs a
tale, a talc of penny buying on

in a suitcase so heavy that it
took two men to lift it, of (less
per-ate trips by merchants to the
hank for pennies only to ﬁnd the
“sold out" sign out.

Conceived by residents ot Macy
house, as a protest against res
gr ssive taxes, the idea took def-
inite tori-n yesterday afteinoon.

Squads of students put on an
intensive drive for pennies in
every store in Grinnell, following
hank closing hours Friday. By
midnight, nearly 1,000 had been
collected, and plans were laid to
get control of the supply at thel
bank next morning.

First in line as the hanks open-
ed were students dressed as fleshe
men, pleading “hell week" as
cause for their demand for pens
mes, pennies, “All the pennies
you've got."

Soon they staggered out drag-
ging a suitcase filled to overflow
ing With nearly 27,000 pennies.
