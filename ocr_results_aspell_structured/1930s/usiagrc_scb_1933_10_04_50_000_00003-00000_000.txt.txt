into camp for the first victory of the
year.

Michigan State Overcomes

Crinnell Eleven

East Lansing, Michigan (Special)7
Michigan state college defeated the
Crinnell college football team 14 to 0
here Saturday afternoon, in the first
game of the season for the Spartans. a

Coach Lester Watts cohorts pull
up a stiff battle, weakening only in
the second quarter, with the wind
agalnst them, allowing the statei
team to cross their goal twice. Thel
entire second half was played on evenl
terms.

More than 10,000 persons witness-
ed the game. The Pioneers had sev-
eral scoring chances spoiled by pen-
alties, but on several occasions
threatened the Spartans. Coach Baclr
man, of the Michigan State team had

 

built up a strong offensive, and
despite the efforts of the Pioneers
they could not stop their opponents
in the second quarter. Clark's kicks
ing and Kingery's passing were fea-
tures or the Grinnell play that were
outstanding.
