Quarteljback Star of Every
Grinnell Grid Contest
This Season

Henry (Hank) Thomas, with first
state ranking as quarterback almost
within his grasp as a result of his
sensa- onal work in Grinnell's four
victories in five games, today opens
his campaign for all-Missouri Valley
conference honors when he trains his
guns on Washington university.

That many of Thomas’ runs this
year have been aided by first class
hlocking, no one can deny. That his
passes have been to adept receivers
is patent. Without the rest of the
Pioneer eleven, Thomas would be
lost, but individually, he is one of the
greatest backfield stars ever to ap-
pear on the Grinnell gridiron.

Contained Fresh

The little quarterback started his
collegiate career auspiciously as cap-
tain of his freshman team. His
sophomore year was spent partially
on the bench when he served as un—
derstudy to Ernie Mclntire, veteran
quarterback and punter.
. Although this was his first year of
varsity football, Thomas turned in
some sensational performances, his
showing against Carleton that season
being one of the best. He intercepted
a pass to rim so yards to a score,
and on the next play returned the
kickoff 67 yards.

Broke Leg

Last year Thomas’ hid fur stardom
was halted in midflight by a broken
leg. Nursing his injury throughout
the fall and winter, he was ready for
track in the spring, and his speed.
over the no yard distance won him
the post of captain for 1932.

Hank started the 1931 football sea—
son with a hang when, in the first
quarter of the Coo-Grinnell game
here he tramped his way through
tackle for 75 yards and a touchdown.

Unscheduled Pass

At state Teachers college he sur—
prised the fans by tossing an un—
scheduled lateral pass to McCreary
for one of Grilmell’s touchdowns. It
was only one of many insmnces to
show that he had his head in the
game all of the time.

At Cornell, the Purple grid play-
ers were caught unawares when
Thomas, immediately upon receiving
a punt, stopped in his tracks and
booted the oval back over the heads
of onrushing tacklers. st. Louis
university cheered the audacity of
the Pioneer speedster who stood
hack of his own goal to fake a kick
and then carry the hall to the 35
yard mark.

Crashes Line

Carleton experienced some chagrin
in going against Thomas again, only
to see him score a pair of touch-
downs and pass to another. One of
these scores came from a 61—yard
sprint.

The quarterback is scarcely built
for line plunging, weighing only 150

honors.

l MISSOURI VALLEY’S THREAT
. _ . _ a

 

Hank Thomns‘ scmﬁllatmg work in the bncldield has been the
oulstallding mature of Grixmell’s Vicious offensive this season Nmn)’
sports scribes are already marking him for oustate and all—conference

 

pounds, but he regularly crashes for

lgains, using his speed for as great

an advantage there as when he skirts
the ends.

It is significant that he has either
scored or passed for all of Grimell‘s
11 touchdowns this season, and with
Ullrich out of the game, he is now dos

.ing the drcpkicking for point after

touchdown. ,
snot Pass Works
Alumni who regretted the passing
of Russell Ruff will see another
great passer in Thomas. Those who
predicted the downfall of Grillmell’s
famous spot pass over center as Ruff
was graduated will he relieved to
know that such a play, on a pass
from Thomas to Duncan, has scored
four of the Pioneer touchdowns.
Washington will be watching
Thomas today. He is a marked man
in every game, but he manages to
get away for his share of gains, not-
withstanding. Although Missouri
Valley teams will he watching him,
Thomas should, barring injury, prove
himself the best quarterback in the
state and in the conference this sea-
son.
