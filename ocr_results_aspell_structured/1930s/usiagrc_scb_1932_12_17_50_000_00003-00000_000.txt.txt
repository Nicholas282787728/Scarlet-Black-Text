Interior Decorator
Tells Students

‘Furniture Story’

 

G. F. Weber, interior decorator
from Minneapolis, talked to the ins
Lerior dEcoraling classes and inter-
ested Students Thursday on “The
story of Furniture."

Illustrating his
engraved plates and pieces of furni-
ture in the room, he traced the de-
velopment of furniture up to the
present time. He discussed and come
mented upon the Styles of furniture
in Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle
Ages, France, England, and America.

Mr, Weber defined furniture as the
expression given an idea current at
a certain period of history by a
group of people, and pointed out the
influence politics, economic condi—
tions, and costumes have had upon
furniture. ‘

A group of textiles was on display
which included sillm, velvets, and
woolens. The pieces were reproduc
trons by modern textile manufactur
ersr of historic designs and cloths.

MT. Weber lunched at the quad~
rangle after visiting the dormitory
club rooms and the cottage parlors.‘
His lecture was given at the Presi-
dent’s home through the courtesy of
Mrs. Nollen.

the Aggies a swelled-head."

Mr. Truesdale elucidated this state-
ment by emphasizing the fact that
not so long ago Giiniieli was Missouri
Valley track champion, Drake, foot-
ball champion, and Creighton, ba
ketball champion. ”If after attaining
superiority in a sport every school
left the conference, there soon would
n't be any conference." concluded the
Pioneer basketball mentor.

uMutual Understanding"

“There is a mutual understanding
among all members of the Missouri
Valley conference that absolutely
nothing shall be said or done to dis-
couragethe Oklahoma school from
participating in the Missouri Valley
loop and I do not want my statement
interpreted a violation of that agree
ment.” he added.

It is rumored that the Aggie/s res

is hoped for.
