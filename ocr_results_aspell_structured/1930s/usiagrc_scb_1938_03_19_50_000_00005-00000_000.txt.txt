, 440 Title at Stake
gAs Trackmen Meet
Valley Foes Tonight

By Wells Barnett

When the Grinnell track team
competes this evening in the
Missouri Valley conference indoor
meet at Des Moines, one Pioneer
runner Will he defending a title
from last year's meet. He is Lynn
Schlotterheck, star quarter-miler,
winner of the IMO-yard dash last
year. ,
After his sparkling perfor-
mance at North Central in the
Midwest Intercollegiate meet last
week, sehlotterheck stands an ex
cellent chance of repeating last
year’s win and adding to the Pio-
neer point total.

Also outstanding in the con—
ference competition tonight will
he John Hayward, weight man
and sprinter, who can be depended
on for a first or second in the
high hurdles. His only serious
rival will be Tulin of Drake whom
Hayward has beaten several times
in former years. He will come
in for far stiffer competition in
the shot, with Allan Dillon of
Drake the outstanding contender.

Although Drake is again favorw
ed to take the conference title,
the Pioneers this year stand an
excellent chance of placing high
in the competition. Depending on
balance between every event on
the program rather than a few
high-scoring stars, Gl'innell will
present a well-rounded team, with
soaring ability throughout.

Most of the Pioneer scoring
power comes in their ability to
pile up an impressive total of
seconds and thirds. 1n defeating
North Central college at Napiel-
ville, 11l., the Grinnell runners won
fewer firsts than did North Cen-
tral, but balanced strength gave
the scarlet-clad men the margin.

Mal Award
Rules Revised

Two Letter Standard
Gets Approval of
Faculty Group

The proposed revision to make
ivrestlmg a major sport and the
requirements for awards under
the new system have been ap—
proved hy the faculty committee
on athletics.

With the new system in effect,
men fulfilling certain requ‘ e—
ments will he awarded major let—
ters, and those meeting the lesser
requirements will receive minor
awards.

The approved proposal allowing
a man to win the major award
was stated: “To win a major
award, a wrestler must score an
average of one and onesllalt'
points per meet in all major
meets on a schedule of four ma-
jor teams as well as maintain
that average for all meets sched-
uled." .

The requirement that a wres-
tler must win 30 per cent of the
points possible for him to win in
a schedule of four or more meets.
remains the same for the minor
award.

it:

In addi on to Hayward and
sohlotterheek, Grinnell may ex-
pect to have powerful contenders
in Burke Powers in the broad
jump and low hurdles, and Harold
Secger in the half-mile. Both
men have been consistent point—
winners all year, Appelquist,
Cranny and Stryker and the re~
lay squad are also expected to
share in the scoring.

Main problem now for coach G.
Lester Duke is to find a replace-
ment on the mile relay team for
Ray Crossinan who is forced to
retire from competition because of
an insured foot. It is prohable
that a sprinter will be used in
his place.
