would be a mighty good thing tor

13 feet tour inches or the total,
Drake, s toot eight, and Btltlel',l
six Ieet seven inches. As tar as get-
ting the tip from these baby giants
is concerned, all the Grimlell centers
might as well be cripples.

Fortunately, unusual height is not
an insurmountable advantag Last
year the some six-foot- ightrinch
Schmidt who at present holds downl
the Creighton pivot position started
the game against the Pioneers on thc=
local court. After spending ten or
15 minutes on the court in a vain
attempt to add appreciably to tho
Bluejay total, Mr. Schmidt retired to
the side lines with a sum total or
two points to his credit. The vi
ois eventually eked out a two—pointi
win, but the giant center did not
contribute very materially to thatl
victory, thanks to the excellent
guarding of Morgan and Phelps.

sssses:

Incidenmuy, either the present
Drake quintet is superior to theteam
which represented the Bulldogs dur-
ing the hitter part of last season, or,
the Bluejays arc inferior to thc‘
Creighton the of the some period.
In the second game between the twoi
schools a year ago, the Omaha outlit
humiliated Drake by n was score.
last night, the Bulldogs held Creigliﬁ,
ton to a 367 5 margin. The re -‘
son no mention is made of the iirst
game is that in s tilt Drake tripe
ped up its highly-touted opponents
23 to 20, the loss ultimately costing
the Bluejhys a share in the valley
title.

Intramural eligibility returns to men

Lack of ability shall be the primary

iduals not considered as ‘regulat‘s'
may, provided it does not conflict
this with varsity practices, compete on an
intramural team in another sport.
‘Regulars' as used above, would in-
clude individuals who are competing
regularly, and any others whom the
