'HUMIDOR PACK

means to Camel Smokers *

OMPARE a package of Camels with
any other cigarette and note the
diﬁ'crence in the technique of packing.
Note that Camels are completely en-
closed in an outer transparent cover of
moisture-proof cellophane and sealed
air-tight at every point.

We call this outer shell the Humidor
Pack. It diﬂ‘ers from the ordinary cello-
phane pack and while it is egg-shell
thin, it means a lot in terms of cigarette
enjoyment.

It means, for instance, that evaporsh
tion is checkmated and that Salt
La k e Ci t y c a I:
now have as good
Camels as Winston-

I - l

The Humidor Pack insures that. It
prevents the ﬁne tobaccos of Camels
from drying out and losing any of their
delightful ﬂavor.

Aside from cheap tobacco, two fac-
tors in a cigarette can mar the smoker’s
pleasure:

Fine particles of peppery dust if left
in the tobacco by ineﬂicient cleaning
methods sting and irritate delicate
throat mmbrane.

Dry tobacco, robbed of its natural
moisture by scorching or by evapora-
tion gives off a hot smoke that burns
the throat with
every inhalation.

to you with their natural moisture
content still intact.

It is a very simple matter to check the
difference between Humidor Packed

Camels and other ordinary dry cigarettes.

First of all you can feel the diﬁ'erence
as you roll the cigarettes between your
ﬁngers. Camels are full-bodied and
pliable. A dry cigarette crumbles under
pressure and sheds tobacco.

If you will hold a cigarette to each car
and roll them with your ﬁngers you can
actually hear the difference.

The real test of course is to smoke them.
And here’s where the new Humidor Pack
proves a real blessing to the smoker.

As you inhale the cool, fragrant smoke
from a Camel you get all the wildness
and magic of the ﬁne tobaccos of which
it is blended.

But when you draw in the hot smoke
from a dried cigarette see how ﬂat and
brackish it is by comparison and how
harsh it is to your throat.

If you are a regular Camel smoker
you have already noticed what proper
condition. of the cigarette means.

But if you haven’t tried Camels in
the new Humidor Pack you have a new
adventure with Lady Nicotine in store.

Switch your affections for just one
day, then go back to your old love

tomorrow ifyou can.
