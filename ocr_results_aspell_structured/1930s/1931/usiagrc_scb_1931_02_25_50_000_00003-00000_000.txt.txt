closed the first half counting with a
field goal, and the Golden Avalanche,
was in front, 13 to 7. 3

Four minutes of the last period
elapsed before a point was made}
Marquette’s German tipoff man com-1
pleted a charity throw successfully1
after Humphrey was ruled out of the}
battle on four personal fouls. While
the Golden Avalanche quintet nursed
14 points, the Grinnellians accounted
for three field goals. Duncan col-
lected two buckets and Douglasi
snagged one. ‘

Duncan Ties Count 1

Marquette called time out, and,
with nine minutes of the contest re-j
maining, came back to boost thel
Golden Avalanche lead to 16 to 13
on free tosses by Captain King and
Budrunas. A gift throw by Captainl
Ruff and a field goal by Duncan‘
knotted the score at 1646 with five,
minutes of play left.

Ruff and Duncan garnered a has—
ket apiece, and Douglas hooped a gift
toss to give the scarlet and black a
fivepoint edge. 21 to 16. with less
than 60 seconds left, Captain King
pushed the Marquette count up a
point by a free throw, but the gun
sounded with the Truesdale men in
front, 21 to 17.

King Directs Plays

Capt. Joe King and Walter
”Whitey" Biidrunas were the Blue
and Gold luminaries. with a twitch
of his head, King signified plays for
the cagers which were clever and
speedy. Budrunas counted heavily in
the scoring column during the first
half, but managed to sink only two
charity throws in the last period.

Frank Duncan stirred for Grin-
nell, with Dewitt McCreary again
staying near the center of the floor
on offense to spot pass or receive the
hall from under the basket. By the
margin of a Pioneer technical foul.
Duncan lost the scoring honors of
the game to Budrulins. .

What is your opinion of the all-
collcge open forum held in chapel
Monday?

Robert Bradford: I feel it. was very
successful in that ill. gave Grinnell 3.
place for faculty—student discussion.
Perhaps the discussion hereafter can
be drawn to a more definite conclus-
ion.

Kate Coggcshall: I think that the
forum was successful as it accom-
plished its purpose—to stimulate
thought concerning cheating.

Lu, Henson: It will. in my opinion,
have been a great success if some of
us do not ﬂunk our courses as a re
sult of certain disagreements.
