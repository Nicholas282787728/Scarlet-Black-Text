Just what was it that a certain
girl on the first tloor of Cottnge Five
was advertising one day last week?
We are at a loss, but understand
that James Tipton could {unhiﬂ'i the
information:

An excellent example of frater-
nal leniency was cited in one of
our classes not long ago. Calling
a student out or the class, one
professor remarked in another.
“May I hold this girl awhile?”
“It’s up to you, Mr. Doe, it’s up
to you," replied his generous col-
league.

It is embarrassing to ask your
secret passion to a women’s varsity,
only to ﬁnd upon arriving that you
lack a dime of having enough to pay
the admission fee. The correct pro-
ceeding in such a case is to turn
nonchalantly to the date, and yell
for the “inﬁnitesimal” part of the
dollar.

All bail to Edward “Nick" simms,
winner of the tin loving cup in Clark
hall's first “TIDDLEDY WINKS"
tournament. Ever cool and calm.
hardly noticing the huge crowd which
had gathered in the Stevenson—Ed—
ward suite, Mr Simms, who said that
his only trammg for the sport had
been in the venerable game of horse
shoes, “out~ﬁddled” his nearest op-
ponent by a safe margin.

 

The play-by lay reports of the
tournament, in which so young
and healthy students contended,
were carried by tho minions metro»
politan newspapers of the country,
including the ST. Lotus GLOBE
DEMOCRAT. Always on the look-
out for business, Jim Roberts has
already sold and ordered 15 copies

of the poperl
.

Anyone who won numerals in
freshmen ping pong is ineligible
for the sport.

As a social secretary, Chad Letton
makes an ideal trainer. Upon the re-
quest of two of the basketball stars
who were leaving on a trip, Chad,
who always WAS an ohliging soul,
proceeded -to arrange dates to greet
them upon their return. The only
difﬁculty seems to he—he got them
mixed!

We understand that "White City"
in Chicago isn’t the only place that
has marathons. Gates hall has a cage
star who seems ﬁtted to become the
”World's Champion Marathon Tele-

phone Conversation Artist!”

During early practice»; he monnp<
olized the phone so long that his
partner at the quad had to ask for

a short rest period beiore continuing.

Mr. Scott returned to the con-
test a few minutes later, equipped
with $1 chair and a. shower bath,
and was still going strong when
the couege central went home to
bed.
