WANTED—A VARSITY CLUB

As Griuucll college’s social season gets under
way with the second varsity dance of the season
tonight, upperclasslnen are. beginning to wonder
about tlle Varsity club which saved a declining
dance attendance last year. Did the club lose
money? Did it break l? Is it possible to con-
tiuue tlle organization tl s year?

If the club was an unproﬁtable venture no one
could expect it to continue. If it broke even, or
nearly so, every effort should be made to continue
it, for such an organization permitted many, who
would otherwise have been forced to stay away, to
attend college dances,

A start such as was given the club last year,
when students saved enough on one dance to pay
for their club tickets, should put tlle organization
on its way tow d a large membership this year:
It deserves contmuation if possible.

THE NEW GRADE SYSTEM

Among the many educational problems of to-
day, one which seems to hold special interest for
the college student is that of grades Many be~
licve that grades have no value, that they are not
a true standard of judgment, and that their ex-
istence breeds an undesirable feeling among the
student body.

Be that as it may, the faculty has made a new
change in the grading system this year as a result
of this student opinion, Under this plan, the alpha-
betical classiﬁcation formerly used has been re

. Kenneth E. 013th ~

placed by one consisting only of the marks ‘satis-
factory’, ‘passiug’, and ‘failure'. There is to be
no grade or scholar list publisllcd. However, the
old method of grading will still be used ill the col-
lege ofﬁce. Upon graduation, one lnay receive his
grades by request.

It, then, the old grading system is still going
to be employed ill part, it would seem that such
a change as has been made is quite withoult real
value. Should a graduate apply for a job and be
asked for his grades, they would be sent to the
person requesting them from the college office
where they will he kept on file. Grades will count
for something after all. Besides, it would seem
that any graduate interested in his education at
this institution would be curious about his grades
without waiting until sometime later when he is
asked for them. \Vllel'c, then, will the new grading
system make a difference?

It appears that its only justiﬁcation is in note
ing as a temporary salvo, which will for four years
lessen the anxiety of students who are not proud
of work which they have done. No one is so likely
to feel hurt because he has received low grades; if
he can maintain only a ‘0’ average, his report card
will show as good work as any As a result the
caste system will tend to disappear; all will he
cqualiilpparcntly. In effecting this change ill
gradiu , the faculty has made a concession to
mediocrity.

G

ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL

It goes without saying that social life plays an
important part in any college today. Many of the
critics of our colleges evcn contend that academic
pursuits have been subordinated to social aspirar
tions and in so far as this has been done the social
life is detrimental to best results from studies. No
(louht with some colleges and \itll some individ-
uals in any college such a criticism is justiﬁed. 0n
the other hand there are individuals in any colr
lcge who place al emphasis on studies, failing to
see the value of social education. This type of stu~
dent is perhaps equally deserving of criticism for
his narrow viewpoint.

All men and women entering college luust
make their decisions on this problem. \Yill they
elllﬂibasize the social life to the extent of making
grades. or rather what grades should indicate, only
a means for this other cud, \\ ill they isolate thcm-
sclvcs ill their academic pursuits from everyone
except at class time, or will they take the middle
course and make college life include both the
vars v ticket and the textbook

Perhaps no student will sit down and reason
this out to his best interests, but the decision is
to be made one way or another. It seems that the
value of social life is many times underestimated
by the traditional student and should not be strict
ly ignored. No small part of the success of the
student in later life depends upon his case in meet-
ing people acquired by frequent contacts and as
sociations during college.

The dance is the nucleus around which the
social life is built Not to know how to dance
means exclusion from one essential and valuable
phase of a college course—the social life, New
students may well afford to know how to dance,
it they do not already, for while studies should be
the primary concern they are not everything.
