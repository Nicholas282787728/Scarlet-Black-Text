Our idea of Juliet (Shakespeare‘s
anyway) was a beautiful lady dress-
ed in flowing rohes and standing
on a balcony. One little gal in Mears
seems to have a different idea
though. Her costume, when she play-
ed the part, using the fire escape as
her halcony, closely resembled that
of a certain famous horsewoman,

Mrs. Godiva.

Another prof wrecked his car last

we'd have to prohibit them the use
of cars during the school year, or
at least until after spring vacation:

A good plan would he to limit
cars to those who can keep at least
half the class awake during a leo-
ture.

Religion Needs Traditions
“In order to produce an cflchive
religion, tradition must rst," point-
ed out the Gates lecturer “We must
know the history 0[ peoples, as man's
life repeats itself again and again.
By the study of the past, we can
gaze into the future with an appre~
understanding of our~
selves and our religion.

sym-

“Science is not a repetition. It pre-
sents a constant curiosity which
leads on to greater heights." Mr,
Ward showed how the world can com
trihutc its success and accomplish-
ments to such a curiosity.

Rests With Future Generations

“The basis of effective religion,"
said the speaker, "must rest upon the
present and future generation's abil-
ity to accept science as a stepping
stone and means of measurement. In
this manner, science, philosophy, and
religion will he joined together for
the creation and perfection of a true
ethical order."

With the last Gates lecture, the
seventeenth annual Fellowship'con.
ference of Ministers and Layman of
the Congregational Churches of Iowa
ended at Grinnell college. The pro—
gram of the fellowship meeting in-
cluded several addresses in addition
to those given by the Gates Memorial
speaker.

Religion Develops
Cooperative Society

“Religion is called upon to develop
a cooperative society to prevent
people from repeating hlundcrs of
the past," Thus H.F. Ward, professor-
of Christian ethics at the Union
Theological seminary and this yeal"
Gates speaker, summed up his Thurs
day night lecture in Herrick chapel.

Mr. Ward said that only through a;
more intolerant attitude toward‘
Wrong, and a feeling of helpful co-
operation toward society, could the
religion of tomorrow expect to corral
and iron out the difficulties of‘the
present economic situation in Amara
ica.

Mil.“ a Part of society

In developing his subject, “Inade
ouacy of Liberal Christianity,” Pro.
fossor Ward said, “Not until man
sees himself as part of the creation
and redemption of society can this
liberal religion have the creative caa
pacities to make a new cards." '

This was the fourth Gates Memorial
lecture of the week, and the only
evening talk given by Mr. Ward in
Grinncll.

Modem Temper
Doubts Religion

“Modem temper doubts religion,
science, and philosophy, and both God

and man. People of today find nothing
good in the World," said Prof. Harry
lF. Ward of the Union Theological
seminary in his lecture Thursday
,morning on “The Futility of the
Modem Temper.”

Mr. Ward feels, however, that the
modern attitude toward life is but a
renewal of lllonnstlcismian escape
from the battle of life.

Faith in Man Needed

Professor Wnrd showed that unless
the spiriL of the age changes, history
will say that iLs promisc of a new
world will he as futile as the age of
scholasticism.

As a solution to the problem, Mr.
Ward pointed out that not until one
is willing to become a castaway for
others, will the universe change.

“To save the world from this mod»
crn temper," concluded the speaker,
“we mnst'hava faith in man and in
the moral will of man, rather than
regard life os'a mere spectacle, Only
then will we succeed in cstahlishing
a new society.
