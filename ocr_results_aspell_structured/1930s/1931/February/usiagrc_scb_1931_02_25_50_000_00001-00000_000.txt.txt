for Arts Triad

Departments’ Organization

for Proposed Building
Now Complete

The essentials of a fine arts school
at Crinnell college are now completed

for next year, the curriculum com»
mittee announced today. This, with
the art major, which was passed on}

fine arts triad.

Plans for a fine arts building
south of the campus were adopted]
when the Alumni Recitation hall and
the dormitories were constructed.

organized.

Diﬁmmd for Major

“There has been a crying demand
tor the drama major for several
years," Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor,
director of drama at Grinnell. de-
clared. “and we have lost several Slur
dents because we didn’t have it."

She pointed out that the personnel
office received 30 or 40 requests from
midwestern high schools for trained.
dramatic directors last year. and that
Drake university, the University of!
Iowa, and Carleton college are
supplying a field to which Crinnell
might also contribute.

Like other majors, the drama will
require 24 semester hours. Eighteen,»

minor. which includes six credits in
elementary production, six in the
drama survey, four in playwr ng or
advanced production, and two in acts
log. All these will be required for
the major.

In addition, the acting course will
be extended to cover two semesters.
making four credits of acting. The te~
maining four hours may be selected
from the Shakespeare course, from
the course in direction of public pro-
ductions, or from advanced play-
writing, depending on whether the
individual is more interested in the
literary, the technical, or the creat—
ive aspect. English literature 101-102
and art 101 will he prerequisites.
without counting toward the major
hours.

Play Direction Required

dents will be included in the course
