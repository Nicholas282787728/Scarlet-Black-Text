Local Debaters
Fear Monopoly

of Chain Store

. Grinnell Meets Iowa State
in No Decision Dual;
Cornell Tonight

Only 15 people, including the sir
speakers, mo coaches. and choir-
man. were present at me Iowa State
colleoe debate last night. Grinnell
shim

Grinnell debaters upheld the ar-
firmative of the chain store question
against a trio from Iowa state col-
lege in the clubroom of Gates hall
last night. No decision was given.

Frank Hertel, in the opening de»
bate for the affirmative. brought
out the point that the chain store in
the long run will he injurious to the
best interests of the American pub-
lic, because it becomes highly mono»
polistic. He quoted from statistics
to show that in 1921 chain stores had
2 per cent of the retail business and
in 1928, 19 per cent.

That chain stores tend to central-
ization of capital as well as control
were further points touched by Mr.
Hertel.

Beneﬁts Consumer

The first point emphasized by
Homer King of Iowa state was that
the chain store is beneficial 'to the
consuming public. Mr. King showerl
that for groceriesfor the period of one
year the average family paid $250.62
at a chain store, and 5300.20 at the
independent store. Therefore, he
concluded, chain stores raise the
standards of living in a community.

Russell Lov ion, the second speaker
for the affirmative, stated that the
chain store is working for a. control
of the market and prices, and that it
is detrimental to agriculture. The
chain store is run on a cash and carry
basis and has no credit. The farmer,
according to Mr, Lovi-ien, must have
credit, for he receives his income on-
ly about twice a year.

Lesson in Cooperation

The following speaker for the liege:
tive, Wayne Burchard, maintained
that the chain store has given to the
independent dealer a lesson in efe
ficiancy through cooperation. Since
the independent dealer offers credit,
delivery, and individual clerical serv
vices, said Mr. Burchard, there will
always he a place for him, for, if the
chain'store adopted these pra iccs,
it would be forced to raise its prices.

Price cutting, price manipulation,
and misrepresentation were the
points of the last speaker of the life

the shorter runs, Until Murphy, John

The Bulldogs are certainly starv-
ed. On only three occasions out of
11 games played has Drake come out
on top, Earlier in the season Boelt-
er's proteges woii'ah overtime game
from Washington, 24 to 13, while
recently they eked out a 28.27 win
over Kirksville college

These two victories, sandwiched
around the surprise win over Grill-
noll, represent the total Drake as-
sets for the current season.

Kirksiillc Only Victim
It is a common belief around Des
Moines that the Bulldogs could play
a national championship team a close
game. It is also thought by many
that the result would be the same
should Drake tackle any good high
school quintet.
The season: record certainly justi-
fies this opinion. Since the last
Grinnell gameDrake has lost to Ne-
braska, 30 to 25; to the Oklahoma
Aggles 20 to 14; to Washington, 29
to 2 to St. Louis, 27 to 12, and to
Iowa State, 23 to 20. Kirksville is
the pnly victim during that period.
