Ruthe Cole, when asked to look
far a couple of temporarily miss-

for them under the doormat. Such

a proceeding is difﬁcult to explain,

There ought to he a good sale for
rubbers, umbrellas, slickers, and other
lvet»weather accessories among the
girls of Cottage Five, now that Jean
Francis is acting as advance agent
for the Gotrocks Galoshes company.
Her duties consist of preparing a
market for the company's products
by creating an urgent need for them.
So for Miss Francis has shown an
admirable grasp of her aquatic re-
sponsibilities.

This itelln is in the nature of a
warning to the management of the
dorm dining mom. We don‘t mean
to insinuate anything at all, we
merely suggest that mmsures be
taken to guard the silverware,
spoons in particular, against the
acquisitive tendencies of Clark
Bryan. He might want to—woll,
borrow a few articles some time:

Pot Luck

THE MET.

On second thought, though, our
warning may prove unnecessary
Clark probably wouldn’t even be
interested in the interior grade of
silverware used in the dorms. But
just in Case he should stoop so
low, we hope the proper authorities
will be ready to deal with him as
smciently as did the head waiter
In the Florentine room of the Sav-
ery Sunday.

Ask Dottie sous what the word
“lake" immediately suggests to
her: Yes, wouldn’t you know it
would be something like that? You
couldn't expect to keep Alex's
name out of it, when the innocent
little noun “neck" made Dottie
think right away of “dawellport.”
These psych association tests are
somegnos usclul, or at least re-
valuing.

 

it takes practice to acquire an ideal
church demeanor. Perhaps Fran
Cameron hasn't had sufﬁcient experi-
ence along that line. A course in the
“Correct methods of handling a coir
lection plate" might he of some value
to hen Unfortunately this institution
or learning does not otter such a
course, but if Miss Cameron will leave
her name and address around somer
where, we will endeavor to let her
know where she can secure an auth-
orized booklet on “Church attendance
in its more important phases."
a . s

in spite of her extreme reticence
concerning the matter, we ﬁnally dis—
covered in Jeanette Hamel a slight
adverseness toward publicity, and
particularly Doric puhlicity. We ap-
preciate Jeanette's noble effort to keep
us from learning the truth, but our
sensitive nature is deeply wounded by
her attitude, and it is with tears in
our eyes and a great sob choking our
throat that we take this opportunity
to apologize.

It seems that the student cone

vocation Monday was rather a

surprising success. There was a

good deal or hilarious discussion,

muchapf it quite proﬁtable, At any

rake, a good time was had by all,

and everybody got over his grouch

at having to begin the day 20

minutes earlier than usual. which

is about two hours and 20 minutes

too early for any normal human

being anyway!

And, apropos ol the convocation,
maybe something should he done
about Ed White’s mtiug at the quad»
mingle. What do you think?
