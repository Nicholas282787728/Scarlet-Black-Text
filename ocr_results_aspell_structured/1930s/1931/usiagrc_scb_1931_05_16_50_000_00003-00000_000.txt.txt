Langan Hall upset the dope bucket
Thursday to earn an unexpected win
over Building Three, 11 to s. Edman,
twirling for Langan, held his oppon»
ants in check until the final inning,
when a drive netted ﬁve runs, but fell
short.

Bulmahn started on the mound for
Three and pitched well, but was
backed by poor support. Handicapped
by a swollen ankle, he was forced to
retire from the game in the fourth.
Ruii relieving him. The whole Lana
gan team functioned well, and played
alert baseball to win.

Smith defeated Clark Wednesday
12-5 for its first win of the season,
but received a heating at the hands
of Dinble yesterday, 9 to 1, Peterson
