Michigan State May Play
Grinnell Grid'men in 1932

Negotiations have been under way
here ,to schedule a football game with
Michigan state at Lansing Oct, 1
next season, but complications may
make it necessary to change the date.
Michigan and Northwestern are txy~
ing to schedule a game on Oct. 3.
Michigan has scheduled Michigan
state on that day but if the Purple
shifts its game with Stanford to
1934, Michigan will change its game
with the Lansing team to Oct. 1 to
meet the Evanston team Oct. 8. In
such a case, the Crinnell game with
Michigan state will be played act. 8.

The annual Iowa gridiron classic,
the Drake-Grinnell game, will lug
played at Des Moines Oct. 29. Tenta-
tive plans for the rest of the schedule
include games with Washington at st.
Louis Nov. 5, Creighton here Nov. 11,
and Coe at cedar Rapids Oct. 15. The
slate may also include Carleton, state
Teachers college and Cornell.

Seiver Talksto Y.W.C.A.
on Christmas in Balkans

George 0. selver, assistant profes-
sor of French, talked on Christmas in
Roumania at the meeting of the
Young Women’s Christian association
in the quadrangle drawing- room
Thursday evening.

Roumanian Christmas differs from
American celebrations in that it
is less commercialized and heralded.
More attention is paid to the church
services, and there is a less frenzied
attempt to give everyone a present.
