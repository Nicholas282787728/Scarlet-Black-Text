TRADITIONAL FUN

Tradition! Some things are taboo bccausc
they “have never been done here”, and there are
things that have been done so long that thcy are
part of Grinllcll college life.

One of the cstablishcd annual events is the
torchligllt parade. It is usually held the night be-
fore the ﬁrst football gamc, as a sort of master pcp
meeting which covers the, whole town in its stains
pcding course. .

To the old students the torch-light: paradc
means crowds of laughing people, rulming, singing,
cheering, who wonder where they go from here,
and then hurry to get there. It means cal ying a
blazing torch, and getting gloriously smoky, and
cheering oneself hoarse over the team. It means
downright fun.

To the new student should go just a word of
advice, Don’t miss the parade, if you have ally
school pep and like a good time. Put on old clothes
Thursday night and come out to cheer for the

team.

HAS VICTORY DAY DEGENERATED?

Without doubt, thought of the poss'bility of
holding another Victory day is now present sub»
consciously in the minds of many students. With
this possibility a potential force with strong likli-
hood of breaking forth into action, faculty and
student leaders may ﬁnd it advisable to put for-
ward some substitute for any unorganized celcr
bration.

That last year’s Victory day departed from
the patriotic purpose of the previous year cannot
be denied. To set aside a day upon which to actu-
ally honor thc football men for their achievements
is one thing. To merely declare a holiday under
that prctcnsc is another, A real day of tribute to
the Pioneers is to the point, but a Victory day
which is only a sociable holiday is nauseating.
Liltc the celebration of. too many of our national
holidays, last year the day was kept Without snfe
ﬁcicnt, if ally, thought of why it was observed.

A Victory day held after a hard-fought game
in honor of tbosc who played that game, is a
splendid idea. The men who arc about to go into
action for Grillnell on the gridiron this week dce
scrve such homage, It is to be hoped that, with
appreciation of a valiant squad of football men in
mind, faculty and student leaders will plan u suit-
able means for giving the Pioneers a (lay of praise,
dedicated to them in spirit and fact as well as in
namc.

A PLEA FOR PERIODICALS

It is unfortunatc that o collcgc the size of
Grinnell should be handicapped with the unsatis»
factory library system it has at present. It is to
bc rcgrctcd that periodicals in which man)" are
interested are allowed to students only during
library hours which sometimes cannot be worked
on the schcdulc of the student. It should be pos-
sible to make arrangements so that tho period“ ls
could be taken out evenings and weekends ( is
done with books on reserve), instead of allowing
only professo to talic them out ovcr weekends.

If instead of having books inaccessible to lie
brary users they could be reached and handled
by students (cxcept books on rescrvc), a great
deal more alisfaction could be gotten from the lie
br 'y, cspccially by those who enjoy browsing
about by themselves.

There has also been a quite gcncrul feeling
that the library should bc ltcpt open for at. least
a few hours on Sunday. A taboo inflicted in the
days when Griuncll w“ a denominational school
should not illflucncc thc ﬂdlilllllsil‘ﬂlloll now. Tllc
fact that many colleges and universities do observe
the practice of liccping their library open for a
time during Sunday, gen ally part of tho cv ling,
shows that such an idea is not out of the ordinary
and not impractical.

YOUNGER FRESHMEN

Grilmcll should follow with interest the to
sults of the new system of education inaugurated
this fall at Cornell collcgc. Undcr this new plan,
students who have had thrcc years in high school
and who have passed the required entrance exam-
inations are admitted as fullvflcdgcd freshmen to
Cornell,

The new system has been worked out in col-
laboration with the university survey of the Uni-
versity of Chicago, the survey of educational iue
stitutious of the Methodist church board of cducae
tion, and Dr. Carl E, Seashore, dean of the grad-

 

uate school at the University of Iowa. However,
it is Dcilll T R. McConnell of Cornell who has
direct super lsioll oi the experimcllt. According
to Dean McConnell, “euricluucnt of educational
cxpcricuca and accclcration of progress” of ,cx-
ccptional students is the prime aim of thc oxpcrie
ment.

The plan has many merits. In tllc ﬁrst place,
the lnorc mature. studentsiand some high school
juniors arc of oldcr mental age than many high
school seniors—have the opportmlity to forge
ahead into their proper class. The studcllt who
has dccidcd on his career by the eleventh gradc
nced wastc les time with general subjects im-
posed by the ll gh school curriculum.

The trend oi the times is more and more to
ward higher education and the demands [or grad-
uate study are becoming greater. This tends to
prolong the period of education. Any means, there
fore, which will shorten the period of study with-
out detractioll from the necessary education should
be welcomed. The University of Chicago has been
a pioneer in new methods of education. Consu-
qucntly their support of the plan should be value
able.

STUDENTS MAY SAVE

Local clcancrs, or whoever is responsible for
the cutting of clcaniug and pressing pl 5 ,ill
Grinnell, arc to be commended. Ono is often
likely to ﬁnd cleaning and pressing prices low in
a college town, but such has not been the Case
llcrctoforc in Grillllcll. The problem of ’
neatly was one to be considered ﬁuauci 11y as
well as from the mere standpoint of personal
cal-c.

In Dos Moilics, wllcre overhead gives one the
impression that costs could reasonably be higher,
is was possible to have two suits cleaned at less
than one-half the cost of one here last year. This
was not the casc ill a single establishment, but in
many rcliablc places about the city. The con-
dition in Griuncll has changed, however,

Studcnts here will do well to make use of
the local out which will benefit them directly.
Grillncll will appreciate the business.

, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

Most old Grinnclliaus wcl-c aroused when tllcy
discovered that they were required to return to
School by Sept, ll when in former yours Grillllcll
has never opened until Sept. 20. No one has dise
corned the cause for this strange schcdulc change
but all suffered. There might. be compensation for
this change if School were to close a week earlier
ill June, but, according to the most recent college
catalog, commencement is not to be held until
June 8. the Sallie time that it was held last year.

This change in schedule is a detriment to thc
student as it ends the summer vacation too soon. It
doesn’t allow students who spent the summer
wor ing sufﬁcient time for a short vacation beforc
returning to their studies. This year—as in all
other years—the ﬁrst few weeks of September
were very warm, and during such weather it is
very difﬁcult for one to become readjusted to
studying. It is doubtful if the ﬁrst week of school
this year was as valuable as it might have been
had classes commenced a week or two later with
more agreeable wcathcn

Grillnell maintains a high Scholastic Standing
in educational circles, cvcrywhcrc. In the past
Grinncll has been able to establish and maintain
this rating with as short a term as any school ill
the countl . This change seems to indicate that
something is wrong somewhere. Why Grinncll
should open so curly while such neighboring
schools as Ioua, Drake and Iowa State can begin
a week or two later and close the same time is a
mystery.

SUGGESTION FOR SUNDAY

It has been said that the church is no longcr
zl religious institution, but has become a social in-
stitution. Some maintain that it has ceased to be
an authoritative institution and is now only ads
visol'y.

But ilo alert, observer can believe that the
church is (loud. From the Catholic chilucs 0E morn
ing in ss to the Method" 1 and Congregational Suns
day schools, for instal c, llavc classes espccialll‘
al ugcd for college mcu and women. The latlcl s
will be led by Prof. H, w, Norris and other popular
faculty members at periods during the year.

Old and new students who make connections
with these social and religious groups during the
your will be amply repaid for their time and ins
tcrcsl.

HAZING RATHER POOR STUFF

(From the Southern California Daily Trojan)

The administration has taken steps to prevent the
annual smearing of paint on the front walks to have
an excuse for hazing freshmen. Last year's paint and
that of the year before still lingered. It was no wonder.

The wonder of it is merely that the students them-
selves haven’t abolished the practice long ago, The ad
ministration apparently is not concerned with what the
students do about hazing; it merely wants the walks
kept clean. The students themselves might now follow
that start that has been made, however, by abolishing
it in all its forms.

The trouble with hazing is merely that it is stupid.
Intended to be colorful it falls a long way short. Where
for its very survival it clings to the claim that it is all-
inclusivc, it probably does not manage to affect one-
tliird of the entering freshman class of this metropoli-
tan institution. Wbut freshman with normal reason
would not simply neglect to wear a green hat? And
what percentage of those who do not do you suppose
will be detected? Cur guess is not many.

And supposing we do haze the freshmen, all or
them. Those entering here no longer consist entirely
nor even overwhelmingly of freshmen. There are many
coming from junior colleges as upperolassmcn.

The whole story is that s c is not one of those
small and highly uniﬁed institutions where a. class on-
ters, remains {our years and graduates virtually intact.
Wc have a changing population because this is s large
institution striving to adapt itself to the variations of a
metropolitan community.

Then for heaven‘s sake, or something, let us end
this silly hazing business. Enough academic discrimina-
tions are already levied against the freshman to let
him know he’s coming into a new place where he must
adapt himself. Hazing might still survivo and be color-
ful in a small institution that can discriminate between
freshmen and others and set up a ﬂagging that is in<
cscapable for all of them. Here its failure to attain its
own purposes is so complete as to be ridiculous.

Campus 0plnlon

Would 3'0“ like to have dormitory
clubrnoms open to munch on Smithy
evenings, insttuu at having the quad-
rangle parlors open to men?

Roberta Vance: The idea of having
the dorm clubrooms open Sunday
night is a good one. It would give
“dates” a different place 10 enter-
Lain themselves and give the rest Of
the girls a chance to usc quadrangle
parlors.

Jolui Glcysteon: Yes.

Alice Kellogg: I think it would be
a good idea. Women could stay in
their own parlors longer after Sun-
day night suppers. It would also give
men a chance to be the entertainer
instead of the entertained.

DIISA L‘Iyl'tle F. Gavin: Ii. is an
idea which might be developed suc-
ocssfully.

Mrs, Alice Holmes: I am Will-
ing that our ClubTDOm should be
opened, with reservations on forms
of entertainment. I think We all feel
the same way.

Albert Rose: Good idea. ClubTOOmS
would be kept in order.

Rod Glcystccn: Personally, I ‘don’t
like the idea.
