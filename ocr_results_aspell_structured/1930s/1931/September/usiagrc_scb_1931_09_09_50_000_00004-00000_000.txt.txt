Undefeated At Home

Although there are only three home
games on the schedule for 1931.
Coach Watt will be compelled to ex—
tend his mcn in order to keep his
undefeated record on the home ﬁeld
for the last two seasons. The Pioneers
were held to a tie by Washington in
the Homecoming game two years ago,
but have not met defeat since the
20719 victory of the Creighton Blue-
jays over the Pioneers in 1928.

The Pioneer eleven faces coe col-
lege September 25 at night, and
Carleton college here October so in
another night encounter. Washington
is the Homecoming attraction Nov. 7
in an afternoon game, The Pioneers
take on ﬁve rivals away from home.
The final game with Drake at Des
Moines in the annual struggle for the
01d Onken Bucket will climax the
season.

Coach Watt is faced with the prob-
lem of ﬁnding a successor to Russell
Ruff, whose forward-passing and
place-kicking won several games for
the Pioneers. The aerial attack,
which has functioned so well, should
be as good this year with such re-
ceivers as Bilto, Edman and G012,
providing a. passer can be found.
