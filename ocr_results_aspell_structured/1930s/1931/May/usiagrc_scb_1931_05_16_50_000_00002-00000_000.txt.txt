LOOK AT THE BY-LAWS

Grinncll college incn deserve commendation
for their failure to suppo't a petition wllicli was
circulated in thc doruiitoi-ics Wednesday night. in.
though meaning well, tllosc u'ho inaugurated the
petition were either misinformed Ol' unacquoilitcd
with the student government plan at Grililicll col
lege when they included the Statement which lie-
cuscd Shelton L. Bcntti‘, dean of men, of admin
tering measures intended to deprive a student of
certain ofﬁces. According to the petition. the dean
took these stops without following the recognized
machinery of student government.

Copies of the petition fish
were placed in bulletin boards in each buildi
in four 01' the ix cu‘cs. campus leaders tool the
papers tlouu without .5 _ ldturcs on them. \Yitliout
knowledge of what had actually Iinppcncd. the
fact that tildolits (lid 1101 Sign the petition amount-
ed virtually to a vote of confidence iii \l‘hatcvci'
Dean tlﬁeatty hlitl (lone.

\s a illattcr of fact, he was not guilty of viola-
ting tudcntx ove'l‘iillicnt procedure. Iii the lliottor
under discuss on, a student Council position, elec-
tion to the ofﬁce comes thr \in the entire student
body after nominations by the council of house
chairmen. These nominations wore held according
to the constitution. There was only one possible
irregularity and that was not a violation of student
government principles. Dean Beatty pointed out
that one of the men cl sen was on probation.

Members of the reti ng council of house choir
men had nominated that student. With announce-
ment of a new ruling which prevents students on
probation from holding campus ofﬁces, the new
council voted to replace the llmnc of the Student
under consideration with the name of another. In
this action it took the wisest cour e ill a difﬁcult
Situation. Had the student been elected aiid then
removed from ofﬁce the cause for his probation
would have been revealed and consequently would
have embarrassed both the college and the student.

Donn Beatty’s cooperation with student organ-
izations, whether the council of house choirmcn or
the student council, has been of the most cffi lent
sort. Critics of, any actions Iaken by him will do
well to look into affairs thoroughly before they
make any statements on that score.

CLASSICS AND THE ARTS DEGREE
(From the Harvard Cruiaoi-i)

in abandoning the classics requirement for the AB.
degree Yale has made another of those breaks with
the past which have gone so far to modify traditional
university education in recent years. The move erases
an obviously illogical provision which made the attain-
ment of the Bachelor of Arts degree depend on the
number of years spent on Latin or Greek regardless of
whether a man majored in chemistry or ﬁne arts.

What prohibition anti the tariff are to political cir-
cles the study of the classics is to the academic world.
in spite of the steady decline in the study of Latin and
Greek, the verbal sparring about the special value of the
classics both for mental training and for unique cultural
contributions has not perceptably abated. The impatient
crusaders for “practical" courses face the less vociferous
but equally sincere defenders of Homer and Sappho or
Virgil and Horace. ‘

The old. school of “born-anddired” classi sts has
recently been reinforced by a younger group who have
emphasized the educational value of familiarity with a
civilization which contrasts so strongly with that of
the twentieth century. Yale's plan for a required course
in classical civilization, if well carried out would providt
a more effective means for attaining this end than the
usual disjointed series of readings from Caesar, Cicero,
and Virgil,

The Yale News assertion that the abolition ofthe
classics requirement at New Haven will “rock the firm
foundation of classical culture in secondary schools” is
ﬁne hyperbole. That foundation has long since lost any
Gibraltar-like quality. it is unlikely, on the other hand,
that the classics are doomed to complete neglect at any
early date.

Harvard ought surely to follow Yale and Princeton
in cancelling the meaningless distinction between its
AB. and SB. degrees by making the arts degree de~
pendent on the ﬁeld of concentration rather than on
knowledge of the ancient languages. Such a change
need not imply a denial by the university of the value
of studying the classics. It would blot out the stigma
of official favoritism which, by arousing an instinctive
antagonism, has probably hindered rather than promoted
a true appreciation of ancient literature and culture,

WHY NOT’ DO A LITTLE MERGING
(From the Creightonian)

Creighton students are always buried under a rush
of parties, picnics, banquets and “Burn days" at this
time of year. Every spring ﬁnds the campus calendar
completely filled with social activities of the various
departments and organizations besides the spring fra»
ternity parties, The result is often disastrous to the well
meaning individuals who optimistically delay their study
ing until the last few days before the examinations.

The idea of giving the students in each department
an opportunity to meet each other on these days outside
the class room, is an excellent one and one that should
be continued but Why not do a little merging of these
various days and set aside one day on which all do—
partments would participate together. Some of the pier
mas and banquets have not been completely successful
due to the lack of cooperation anti enthusiasm on the
part of the students. There are too many things going
on at the some time and the financial drain is too great.

Therefore why not combine these several days into
one all Creighton day at which attendance would be ins
sured On this day the various honors such as Alpha
Sigma Nu, Union Board, chamber of commerce, debate
and other group honors Could be conferred before the
entire student body. A general assembly in the stadium
or in the gyiii would be an excellent opportunity to get
the entire student body together for this purpose. It
would giro the students in the Various schools and cola
logos o[ the university an opportunity to know the out-
standing men in the departments other than their 0011
A gala program could be arranged for the morning and
a general “bum day“ or “fun day" could be planned for
the afternoon.

Much more interest would be aroused by this one
outstanding day and it would be more Successful than
several less important days.
