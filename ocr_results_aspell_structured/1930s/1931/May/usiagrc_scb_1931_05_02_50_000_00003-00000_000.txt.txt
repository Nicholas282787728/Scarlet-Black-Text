You wouldn't believe it, but Betty
Comm and Jim Tiptcn actually sacri-
ﬁced all their classes Tuesdia'y morn-
ing for the sake of affew hours of
sunshine. it's a good idea

The invaluable contri ,uhomof Miss
Isabel Sayre and Miss Alberta Gurus
to our great instituﬂon of looming
has not received the proper recogni-
tion. Through the agency of their
class in stage presence, Miss Sayre
and Miss Gurus hevejlinide it pos-
sible for talented Griiuieuians to ap—
pear poised and canﬂdent'beiore the
pubnc eye Miss Eunice Cutler, noted
campus pianist, admits that she owes
her success to their training.

One year isn’t even over before
you have to start worrying about
where you're going to live the next
year. To make everything simpler,
why don't they just leave the matter
of qundrungle rooms open until fall?
Then, whm school starts, they could
line all the women up along the rail-
road mick lmd let them run for their
rooms. The winners get the rooms,
runners-up get W.A«i. points, and
everybody gets a lot of practical
training for an intramural track

meet.

The relays are over but the feel-

ing lingers on. Now everybody is

back in school for a complete rc-
cuperaticn. My mother told me
