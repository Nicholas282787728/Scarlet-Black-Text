Dear Sir:

It is iindeistood that the appear
ance of ores pajamas at the Brown
Derby Drag has created a great deal
of comment.

We feel sure that many people were
wholly unaware of the nature of the
costumes. Backless formula are no
longer considered immodest or im-
moral. Dress paiamas with jackets
are much lem revealing than the
aforementioned formals. We were on-
aware that this advance fashion
would he considered extreme. Dress
pajamas made their debut a number
of weeks ago in Grinnell and escaped
such unfortunate notoriety at that
time. Perhaps it was because more
coeds bowed down to Madame Fash-
ion than had before that caused their
apparel to be noticed.

If the dance was spoiled for some
people wholly because of our appear-
ance in cotton dress pajamas we of-
fer our apologies. But cotton leads
in materials for formal dresses why
not for dress pajamas?

Very truly yours,
Mary Hayes

(As one of the third ﬂoor Cottage

Three culprits).

Dear Sir:

The meet with Drake last Friday
afternoon demonstrated the possiblli~
ties of a track and ﬁeld meet for real
thrills and excitement. It is to be re-
gretted that only a handful of stu-
dents were present at this meet.

Why is it that track is not better

supported by the student body? I
believe one answer to this question
is that those promoting track meets
are at fault. Often a meet is allowed
to drag out for two or three hours.
spectators allowed to roam all over
the ﬁeld. and various other causes
which make a meet dull and uninterr
esting. If the student body antici-
pates an affair of this kind, it cannot
be blamed for not attending the
meets.
l Last Friday two meets, freshman
and varsity. were run off simultan-
eously and the two meets were over
in less than two hours time. There
was a minimum of delay between
events and there was some event go-
ing on all the time. Distance markers
were placed on the field so that the
spectators could tell what was hap-
pening in the ﬁeld events. The meets
now being held on Ward ﬁeld are well
organized affairs and are run off on
a time schedule.
