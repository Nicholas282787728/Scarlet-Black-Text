Scoring a field goal in the last 33
seconds of the game with Rawson
hall Monday, Clark swept to a 6-2
victory and annexed the 1531 Speed
ball championship. Dibble finished
second in the final standings, with
Gates, 1930 champions in third place.
stson, Langan, and Smith followed
in the order named.

The triumph Monday was a glor—
i'ous victory for Clark, after they

had beaten Dibble in one of the great- _

est battles on MacEachron field
homecoming momlng. For four
quarters, Clark and Dibble struggled
without a score.

Frye Scores

7 Then the game progressed through
one overtime period and far into the
second before Frye, captain of the
Clark hall team, took the hall singles
handed half the‘length of the field
to score the only three points of the
game.

Singularly enough, both Dibble and
Clark had been beaten once before,
but each time a protest was allowed
and the games played over. Smith,
cellar occupants, nosed out Dibble in
the first game of the season and
Rawson hall defeated Clark two
weeks ago.

Takes Early Lead

Clark took a 2-0 lead early in the
Rawson game but before the half had
ended Woody counted on a dropkick
and Allison's penalty kick made the
score even at 2»all. Throughout the
third quarter and through most of
the fourth, the two teams battled but
rival offenses were effectively stopa
ped.

Darkness made good playing im-
possible late in the game, and with
only a half-minute of play left, Clark
put through the winning goal.

Clark had the ball in scoring pus
sition virtually half of the game, but
a fighting defense thwarted Clark
hall attempts time after time. In re-
taliation, the Clark defense kept the
rival offense in check throughout the
entire game.

Haines Children
Present Clock to
Cottage Four

Children of the late Mrs. Joanna
Harris Haincs for whom Cottage

was dedicated at commencement
time last June, presented that cottage
with a mantle clock in memory of
her, last Friday.

model with a walnut case. It has
both Westminster and Canterbury
chimes. 0n the back there is a plate
inscribed: “In memory of Joanna
Harris Haines, class of 1355. Pre—
sented by her children, 1931." Those
who made the presentation were Mrs.
W. 5. Ray, Mrs, F. 1. Herriott,
Charles names, and Dr. James
Haines.

Mrs. Haines was the first woman
to graduate from Grinnell, and also
the first woman to graduate from
any college west of the Mississippi
river, receiving her degree here in
1865. She died here last July,

Drake Points
for Iowa State

Bulldogs Take 32-20 Jolt
FromMissouri

(Spatial la The scarlet and Black)

DES MOINES—Definitely relegat-
ed to the ranks of underdog after a
32-20 defeat at the hands of Missouri,
Drake's Bulldogs are facing an up
hill battle when they meet Iowa State
college at Ames Saturday in a re
newal of an ancient warfare.

The Bulldogs, although consider-
ably bungedrup by the Tiger fray,
came out of that wild affair in better
shape than has been the custom this
season. Every member of the squad
will be able to appear against the
Cyclones Saturday.

A weakness in tackling appeared
evident in the Drake eleven and it
is probable that Coach Ossie Solem
will spend most of the week stress»
ing this department. In fact, he

bitter rival of the school across the

nell professor and is the author of

by their captain, Mickey Frye, form
a nucleus for the offensive Combina-
tion, Holmes and Schmaedecke were
both well up in the scoring mce. Strar
ley was a mainstay of the flashy
Dibble Offensive, and was awarded
the center position. Captain Ferrara
of Dibble gets the other place for the
fourth consecutive year.

Frye Captain

Capright of Gates and Gwynne—
Vaughan of Smith afforded these
men close competition and were
awarded second team berths. Frye
was named honorary captain of the
first team because of his all-around
good playing.

Rowat of Clark, Hipp of Langan,
and Thompson of Gates were undis~
putedly awarded the three halfback
positions. Each was a vital factor in
keeping opposing teams away from
the goal lines. Wise of Smith was
used both in the forward line and at
halfback, and narrowly missed first
team ranking.

Rowe Goal Guard

Dibble's outstanding defensive men
Were Davis and Van Nostrand and
these ‘two men were placed at full-
back positions. On the second team,
the Clark hall pair, Roth and Val:
Slyke were selected.

There were only two outstanding
goal guards, Rowe of Clark and Kee-
nig of RawSon, although Lee of
Dibble turned in a. consistent per—
formance. Both Rowe and Koenig did
firStrcIaSS work.

Shifts in Team Necessary;
McMillan Returns
to Pivot Post

Six ineligibilities and an injury will
badly cripple the freshman football
team when they meet the Iowa state
Teachers yearlings under the lights
on Ward field Friday night in the
second home game on Lhe yearling
schedule.

Because of these Coach John TrueS~
dale will he forced to make several
changes in his lineup. Phelps and
Clark are working at end berths
with Collison and Anderson. Meeter
and Morgan will probably start as
tackles, and Safris and Edsall will he
the guards, while McMillan, who was
out of the Coo game with injuries.
will start at center,

Fini will start in the backfield at
quarterback and Crews will probably
be at one of the halves. Krider and

F rash Eleven in Tutor Game Friday

riers. Hayden, ground-gaining star
of the Coe freshman game here, went
out via the eligibility route, He
played fullback. Jones, another hack,
also will be lost to the team because
of scholastic difficulties.

Ellis Brown, who injured his knee
in practice last week, is among those
ineligible. others who are out for the
remainder of the season are Nessler,
a lineman; Sutton and Durham,
guards.

Murray, who has been playing cen—
ter, went to the sidelines with a bone
bruise this Week. The injury is not
serious but is too painful to permit
him to play in the game Friday night.

In scrimmage sessions ngainst the
varsity the fresh have shown they
lack a passer which will handicap
them in using varsity pass plays
when they meet the Tutors, With
Hayden out, Crows and Fini will he

Tackling, which was noticcably
poor in the Coo freshman game, has
improved during practices.

OMAHA—The return of two in~

176 Pound Ayernge

Confident that his team, with an
average of 1‘76 pounds of beef per
man, can batter its way through any
defense Grinnell has to offer, for at
least a couple of touchdowns, Coach
Stark is concentrating this week on
building a pass defense. Stopping

Bluejay fans will have a second in

Worthing, competing with Hank
Thomas, Grinnell hope, for starring
honors.

Creighton's eleven has not lived up
to early season hopes this year. Ad-
dition of several heavy sophomores
to the squad did not serve to stop
either Drake or the Aggies, nor has
the offense proven particularly potent
despite the 173 pound average in the
backfield.

for practice for the first time this
season.

talks on better understanding among
nations,

President Nollen's topic will be
"The Education Basis for Peace." He
claims there are two ways to prevent
wars. One is to set up a judicial pro-
cedure for settling international dif—
ferences, and the other is to give this
procedure a chance to act by destroy—
ing the armaments that always tempt
itching fingers to resort to force in-
stead of to law.

He says that war is a great waster,
that it is the major calamity of a
civilized world, and that the United
States is one of the heaviest spend—
ers among the nations, which, after
agreeing to outlaw war are continu-
ing to build bigger armies and navies.
Wars are made by governments, but
