Pioneers End Home Season;
Duncan, Humphrey Tie
as High Scorers

Ending its home season here last
night, the Crlnnell basketball quintet,
after trailing. 16 to 12. at the half,
staged a whirlwind attack in the last
period to emerge the victor over Coe
college. 36 to 26.

It was the second meeting of the
two teams this year. The other en—
counter, on the Cedar Rapids court,
went to the Pioneers by a 30722
score.

Steuart Puts Bee in Front

Kee of Coe started the scoring af-
ter two minutes of play. Baskets by
Kee and Stewart were bettered by
Humphrey and Douglas and free
throws by Duncan. Then Stewart
found the hoop twice, and for the
rest of the half the Kohawks were
out in front. '

Shortly after the start of the next
period, Scott and Duncan sank one
bucket apiece to tie the score, and
then Duncan and Humphrey gave
Glinnell the lead. Coe was unable to
score until Faris dropped in a free
throw and mode the count, 26 to 17.

Grinneu Offense Breaks

Duncan and Humphrey shared the
scoring honors of the evening with
12 points each, Duncan dropped in
five goals in the second half, while
Humphrey was credited with two has
kets in the ﬁrst half and three in the
last period, coupled with a pair of
charity tosses.

Stewart, the Coe captain, scored
nine of his team’s 16 points in the
ﬁrst half, but was only able to garner
one field goal and a free toss in
the following frame. During the be»
ginning stanza he repeatedly broke
up the Grinnell offense to carry the
hall to the opposite basket for a
score.

Creighton Foe Friday

Poor passing and inability to hold
onto the ban characterized the Pio-
neer's play throughout the first half
and part of the second. The advent
of McCreary into the tray in the last
chukker served to strengthen the
Gn'nnell defense to a marked degree,

Douglas and Humphrey starred on
getting the ball off the backboard,
and Christoffersen, who started for
the Pioneers, worked in well as
Douglas’ running mate.

The Pioneers will ﬁnish their sched»

Employment ‘Tips

“Save us from the college grad-
uate who is out shopping for a
position," and ”we have no time
to waste on the man who does not
know what he wants to do,” are
remarks made frequently by ems
ploymcnt ofﬁcials of business or-
ganizations.

Before applying for a position
it is advisable not only to have a
vocational choice, but also to learn
all you can about the particular
ﬁrm with which you are seeking
employment. Such information
may save you a lot of embarass—
ment in the interview.

Local Debaters
Advance Fund
to Meet Crises

Polachek, Blasier, Danforth
Meet Creighton Team

in Auditorium

Griunell debaters favored the es-
tablishment of a reserve fund as a
means or carrying out a deﬁnite
form of unemployment insurance, in
their debate with Creighton univer-
silty in the auditorium of the Alumni
Recitation hall Wednesday night. The
local speakers upheld the afﬁrmative
in the no-decision meet.

Robert Polachek opened the debate
for Grinnell by a deﬁnition of terms.
He pointed to the influx of country
people to the City as one of the chief
reasons for the present depression,
In his constructive speech he empha—
sized two points: the need for unem-
ployment insurance, and necessity of
attacking the problem in a business-
like manner.

Charity Too Costly

The ﬁrst speaker for the negative,
John Dugan, claimed that most gen-
eral plans are charity and prove cost-
1y. He Concluded that even an act of
charity would fail, because there are
too many administrative difficulties.

A deﬁnite plan of unemployment
insurance, known as the American
Reserve Fund plan, was explained by
Robert Blasier of the afﬁrmative.
This plan has four main features: (1)
it is administered by the state depart-
ment of labor, (2) its chief contribu-
tions are made by the employer, (3)
its beneﬁts are small and run for a
limited amount of time, (4) and it
is applied to manual and non-manual
labor earning less than $1,500 a year.
