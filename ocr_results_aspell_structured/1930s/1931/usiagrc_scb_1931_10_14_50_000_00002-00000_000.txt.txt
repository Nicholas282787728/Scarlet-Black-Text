15 COMPROMISE LOGICAL?

Until tlle administration Sccs its way clear to
open tlle stacks in the library, a quite possible Sub-
stitutc might be the creation of a “browsing room”
where at least a few students could. satisfy their
desire to pick and ramblc among selcct sets and
volumes of the best authors. Tllis might serve as
n compromise lllcasure ill the present. library coll-
lroversy. -

The space of the present library is cramped,
bllt a rooln, cithcr tlle one in the northeast corner
of the ﬁrst floor or the one in the southwest corner
of the second floor, could be turned satisfactorily
to this use. Botll of tile suggested rooms are ill
use now by the librarian. Miss Isabelle Clark, and
one could no doubt, be turned into a “browsing
room.” Cataloging in tllc one could be transferred
to tllc room set aside for this purpose, alld other
business of the library could be conﬁned to the
other. Many are eager to take advantage of a
“browsing room," and there is no reason to sup-
pose that it w nld not be as successful as similar
roolns ill the libraries of other colleges and univcr»
sities, ‘ ,

Until President John S. Nollcn ﬁnds it possible
to carry out his program of enlarging the library;
cannot some action be taken tol provide the Stil-
ants with such a room, even though it must of
necessity be rather Small? ‘

INSIDE 0R OUTSIDE?

Isolation seems to be something that proves
llligllty ﬁne on occasions, but is likely to be over~
worked. Human beings are social animals and dc-
sirc company. Otherwisc, dormitory and quad
rangle life in Grillncll college as now carried. on
could not be possible.

America sccms to have learned, ill a general
way, that it cannot isolate itself from the rcst of
the world. This ycar, Hoover’s advancement of
the monitor Ill] was a step toward better inter
national relations. Lindbergh, Stimson, alld any
number of other “good will ambassadors” have
increased cooperation between nations.

China oncc built a wall about her country.

and ill thus isolating herself, progress died. She
cast her lot with departed spirits, and other peo-
ples lived alld advanced, Americans could s lrccly
rcach that stage cvcn with complete isolation for
as a group they are ambitious and show initiative.

It all recalls the wit who called attention to
the foolish use of a fence about a ccnletcry. “Those
inside can’t get out,” he explained, “and those
outside don’t want‘to get in.”

AN UNDESIRABLE MOVE

Gl'illllell college homcconlcrs will again be
tl'eatt‘d to :l lllIXillI’t‘, of humor and football this
yc fit ollc must tel-llr such a lni 'turc a treat.
The Malteascr, campus humor mag line will make
its appearance on honlccollling' day, or the ellllolliS.
That is it should be. Its llcill combined with
tho program at tile football game is another Story,
llowerc-

l\ nly collcgcs have combined their humor
publications alld homecoming programs success
fully. TllL‘ question still rolllains as to whether it
is giving the alumnus what he wants and tleSt‘l‘VOS
on his return, howorc .

Thr llolllccolllillg football game is the distinct-
il‘c event of the program. The program should be
distinctive of that game and should contain not
only lineups and pictures hilt general information
about pla, ‘I‘S 0E both teams. tcllm records, and
some wort about athletic relations betwccn the
two Schools ill other yours.

The Maltcasor is a distinctive humor mag.-
zino. It should undoubtedly carry some holl’lecolne
ing features without the actual program for thc
\Vasllillgtoll game. The Scarlet and Black will do
likewise. Grinllcllians have every reason to be
proud of the brand of humor Vhiell the Malteascl'
is bringing to the campus this year. “lily the
lllunagelnent should ﬁnd it necessary to mix this
with the program for the football game is not
obvious.

Sigma Delta Chi, as the sponsoring organiza-
tion of the Malteaser, should do its best to see
that it ﬁlls its ﬁeld but should likewise prevent
it from stopping illto those whel'c it is out of place.
Though it is too late to l‘t‘lllcdy the situation this
year, tllc homecoming program might be brought
back with the event in 1932 ‘lly stopping the cus-
tom of uniting started last year. Nor would such
a more demand facility intervention.

students reach their zenith in thc.fll t year. Solllce

_(}L
ART OF LOAFING
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Loafer and college man are not synonymous terms.
“Ith Because the college man does not know how to
loaf. True, he can waste time, but he can't loaf.

By lcafing. we mean complete relaxation of body
and soul. with a dash of mental gymnastics thrown
in for seasoning. To be free from the worries of studies,
women, wine, song and athlete’s foot; to be alone with
one’s self; to speculate idly on the Why and wherefore
of things and to puzzle a little over “what it's all
about"; that is the nebulous art of looting. Meditation
cannot be too serious. That. is moodiness. Meditation
must be present, however, Without it, mere suspension
of physical and mental effort is merely vacuity.

Such a form of relaxation as we propose could
possibly take the form of listening, enjoying and under-
standing the impressions of delightful music, “The
Moonlight sonata" or a quaint old mlnuet. The college
man Would rather listen to “Star Dust” while dancing
with the One. That's not loafing, though. That’s work.

The college mall cannot turn to athletics for ether»
eai solace, for they are no longer play. no longer re-
laxation. Football is big business. and even the lesser
sports, the tennis and golf family, have become a
struggle for excellence.

_ In his campus pursuits, the college man works. No
chance to leaf here. Committee meetings to be called,
parades to be organized, addresses to be given, open
houses and dances to be attended and editorial columns
to be written; so goes the merry whirl of timerconsum-
ing and nerverracking campus play.

What chance is there for the college man to become
a loafer? Where is he going to ﬁnd the time for touring?
He's too busy keeping up with the rest ‘of America, If
he did ﬁnd time, could he even enjoy a good loaf? Why,
he hasn't even a nodding acquaintance with the gentle-
menly art. Believe it or not!

THE TRAGEDY
(From the Wisconsin Daily Cardinal)

The Women's editor of the Daily Northwestern~
who smokes notifavors sorority smelting rooms be-
cause she believes they would eliminate street smoking
by coeds. She adds that it “looks woefully cheap and
common to see such a large number of girls walking
on the streets with lighted cigarettes.” Her idea of the

' woeful is peculiar. Really woeful and tragic would he

a large group of girls on the street with cigarettesi
but with not a match among ’em.
