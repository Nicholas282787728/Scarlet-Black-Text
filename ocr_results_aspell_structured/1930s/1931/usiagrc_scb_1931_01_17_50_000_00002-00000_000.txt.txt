COOPRATION IN PLANNING DINNERS
. There is a real need for more cooperation
oil the campus between those students who are
licsponsiblc for the planning of class and organs
lzatiou dinners and thc people who are in charge
of the dining rooms and thc planning of meals.

The latter are willing and engerto cooperate. It
is part of tllci iob to see that such functions as
class dinners are successful ill as for as it is in
their power to make them so. But the students
who are ill charge of the functions, hecausc of the
pressure of other duties. or a failure to realize the
necessity of their cooperation or what their part
in the matter should be. often fail to cooperate as
they should

If the students responsible for milking ar-
rangements for the dinner of any organization
would take the necessary steps with Mi s Anne
Smith or Mrs Louise Thompson at least two days ill
advance of the date sct for the function, they would
contribute materially to its greater success.

Miss Smith and Mrs. Thompson are both
eager to do all the)" can to make sucll dinners
successful, even to planning special menus and
making special seating arrangements ill tllc dili-
ing rooms, but they cannot do these things if
they have not lmcll informed of the approaching
dinner until :l few hours before its occurrence.

0n the student’s part. it is generally a matter
of organizing the function propcl'ly. It is no
more difficult to get the necessary information,
that must go to the heads of the dining rooms
regarding the affairs two days before the dinner
is to occur. than it is to collect it at the last moul-
ent, and it is infinitely more satisfactory to
every one concerned.

Now that Grillnell is entering a season full
of dinner functions of classes and other organiza-
tions, it should l“ v9 hotter cooperation of the
students with those in charge of the dining rooms.

WRITTEN CRITICISM INVITED

Criticism .of the small amount of space given
one dcpartlncnt of Gl'lllllell college ill the news
columns of The Scarlet and Black was expressed in
a letter to the editor during the Christmas holidays.
Because the letter was the ﬁrst one received by
the present management shelving dissatisfaction ill
the policy of attempting to give equal representa-
tion to each department in the college paper, the
writer was asked for permission to print it in the
“What Do You Think” column, The answer was
negative.

Many Grinllcll college people have voiced dis-
approval of the ”play” given athlct . It is true
that enough news is available at times in thcmcn’s
and women’s athletic departments to warrant the
banner and sub-banner, and practically the entire
space on the front page. Tllc Scarlet and Black has
made a better record- th year in alloting space to
athletic stories than ever before, Complete coverage
of men’s and women’s sports is found in cach cdir
ticn, and yct the total number of inches has seldom
reached the limit.

The Grinnell School of Music ranks sccolld tn
athletics ill the total amount of news printed in
the columns of The Scarlct and Black. At present
the new art rlcpilrtluelli. is in third place.

Criticism, whether constructive or destructive,
of the policy of The Scarlet and Black in allottiug
its news space would be welcomed by the manage-
ment. It is to be understood that such comments,
if in letter form, may or may not be printed, the
decision resting with the editor. Letters should be
addressed to The Scarlet and Black, Box 208.

INSPECTING BEFORE REGISTERING

To anyone who looked upon registration with
an ullhurricd cyc this week, it must have nppcarcd
to be it rather casual process. “How’s Psych. 203?
Hard? Then what else is there down?” Some such
remarks circulated frccly.

As to thc subject matter of the course, or its

practical application, nobody cored much. The
blame for this kind of ”hit- -lniss” registration
lies mostly with itlm student, but omc with tho.
method. it is the student’s fault, because no matter
how, clumsy or careless the method may be, the
responsibility for making the best (if it is his.

There is some weight to the argument that
rcp' ’ll‘ﬂlloll should cover three days instead of two.
Ccrtflill dcpartmcllts arc so crowded as to make for
haste ill the actual business. to say nothing of thc
tiresome waiting, If the pl'occss were as much coll-
sultatiou. llllil ltd 'cc, and all opportunity for seer
lug the four v .‘ :l ullit, it would be worth any
amount of u ailing.

There must be some method evolved, llouzcvcl‘,
that would make pos blc a more intelligent choice
of subjects. Tllc only solution seems to be one that
could be dangerously over-worked. This is the
visiting of classes by the prospective student of
that course. The student would then get an idea
of the matter and of the class mallllcr. Tllc difﬁculr
tics llrc apparent. but oil the whole, the plan seems
worth trying.

LOOKING FOR A POSITION?

BACK TO COLLEGE
(From the Des Monies Register)

The new semesters will begin shortly at Iowa's
colleges and universities, and for the young people it
will be the last opportunity until next: fall to take up
the curriculum of the regular school year. At this time,

therefore, the “back to college” movement should meet ’

its greatest success.

The economic situation in Iowa, is not serious, as
compared with many other states. But the ”talk” from
outside has encouraged rumors here of hard times. And
the rumors too often result. in withdrawal of college
students. Adding to the supply of available workers,
these students merely aggravate the employment situa-
tion.

Recognizing this danger, the Iowa Back to College
associationiformed by Cole. Columbia, Cornell, Drake,
Graceland, Grinnell, Luther, Morningside, Parsons, Simp-
son, st. Ambrose, and Upper Iowa—libs made three

recommendations to the civic and service clubs of the '

state:

1. To lend some buy or girl the money necessary
to return to college.

2. To help the student borrow the money by in—
dcrsing his note.

3. To create a student loan fund, or, if one already
exists, to expand it.

The private and church colleges in Iowa estimate
that they save the state's taxpayers $3,000,000 annually
on students whc otherwise would have to be accomor
dated at state institutions. The schools themselves are
extending their loan funds and other sccomodaticns to
the limit, to facilitate the return next semester of every
possible student. It is a movement in which the whole
people of Iowa can well afford to take an active part.

UNIVERSITY OF DETROIT PUBLICITY
(From the Universi-ty at Detroit Varsity News)

Though we have no fault to find with the publicity
the University of Detroit is receiving both in the secular
and Catholic press, we think it worthwhile calling at—
tention to a series of articles which Leo Riordan is
contributing to America, dealing with colleges and their
publicity.

Mr. Riordan points out that while it is comparatively
easy to break into the news columns with accounts of
the football team and its activities, it is a different
matter when it comes tc news concerning the more in
portant college activities. This despite the fact that there
is no definite policy against such news on the part of
the dailies.

In deﬁning publicity he says: "Technically, ’public-
ity’ is that amount of press notice received over and
above what the papers nnnnally print from direct as-
signments to reporters—in ctber wnrds, the result of
seeking the papers, rather than of waiting fur them to
seek you.”

He suggests an adequate department of publicity
for the Catholic college, though he seems to think that
the maintenance of such a department might mean a
considerable outlay of money. In this we think he may
be mistaken. Surely a plan whereby a publicity depart
ment. might be made to function, and function well,
would not of necessity be a great matter of expense
to such an institution as the University of Detroit, say.

There is news and plenty of it, or at least there
should be, in the daily academic and research side of
college life. There is news in the attendance ﬁgures, in
class and club elections, in debates, in matters of ad-
ministrative policy, The next matter for consideration
is the writing of this news in a manner to attract the
eye of a news editor. There is, too, as Mr. Riordan points
out. the necessity of being in print. frequently.
