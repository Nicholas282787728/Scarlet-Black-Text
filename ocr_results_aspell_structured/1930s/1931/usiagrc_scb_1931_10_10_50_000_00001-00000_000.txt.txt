Pioneers Battle at carnal!

 

Team Rests
Friday After
Light Drills

Duncan Returns to Team
Following Infection;
Figland Starts

Grinnell college gridmen closed a
week of light drilling yesterday with
a vacation from regular practice
sessions. Coach L. L. (Fuzz) Watt and
his cohorts left for Mount Vernon
last night and were scheduled to
tangle with the Cornell college grid-
men there this afternoon in the Cor-
nell homecoming game.

Despite injuries which have kept
many men from practice sessions the
Pioneers had most of the regulars
back in the game for today's contest.
Duncan, leading Missouri Valley
scorer, was scheduled to start at his
end post although he has been on
the bench most of the week with an
infection, ‘

Figland to Start

With Trumbull and Craflund, right
guard prospects, gracing the bench
with injuries, Figland’s leg showed
sufficient improvement to permit
the mentor to name him in the start
ing lineup. Rose's arm is in good
shape and the sophomore was in the
game at fullback.

The complete Pioneer starting line—
up, as announced by Coach Watt yes-
-terday, includes Duncan and McKee
at 'ends, Canavan and Bilto at
tackles, Rosenbloom and Figland at
guards, Captain Christoffersen at
center, Thomas at quarterback, Mc-
Crcary and Ullrich at halves, and
Bose at fullback.

. , Purple Term Works

,After slashing through the yearling
eleven Tuesday, the Pioneers were in
a 'ovial mood and rompcd through
signal dﬁlls,ldummy scrimmagcs and
special defensive workouts Wednes—
day and Thursday with speed and
efficiency.

Coach Dick Barker was meanwhile
pounding his victory-starved Purple
aggregation through a week of
strenuéius drills but he had every
regular in the lineup for use today.
His difficulties concern chiefly two
reserve halfbacks, Campbell and
Watson, who are not in shape to

play.

Spencer Keeps
Roman Stones
for Study Here

Students of E. B, T. Spencer, pro-
fessor of Greek and Italian, travel
a rocky road to learning. Prof. Spen-
cer has the largest collection of rare
rocks and marbles used in Old Roman
buildings owned by an American and
he uses them to illustrate his lec-
tures on Rome,

Cicero's home cost $120,000. The
professor contends that he must have
been trying to keep up with the Cae-
sars. Mr. Spencer has frequently
walked over the site of Cicero’s
dwelling.

Rare marbles from temples and
palaces are in the local man’s poa-
session. One marble, he says, is
mined only on the top of a mountain
pesk in Africa. Romans mined it,
transported it over land and sea, and
set it up in 40 foot columns in the
streets of their capital.

Included in the collection are a
fragment from the tomb of St. Hel-
ena, a block from the wall built
around Rome by an emperor 500
years before Christ, or piece of col-
ored plaster from the fresco around
Caesar's palace and a libation cup
used in temples to pour out offerings
to the gods. Mr. Spencer used the
cup in the baptism of his eldest son.

Faculty Divided in Opinion on Stacks

Scarlet and Black Questionaire Shows

In a oucstionaire on the open or
closed library stacks problem con-
ductcd by The Scarlet and Black
among representative members of
the faculty, it was shown that opin-
ion for and against was about equale
ly divided. 0f six faculty members
asked, two were in favor of re-open-
ing the stacks to the students, two
were in favor of a modification of
the present system, and two were
for a continuance of the closed stacks
system.

Their statements follow:

Herschel M. Colbert, professor of
journalism: “The important point,
which I think has been overlooked,
is: Would throwing open the stacks
result in the quickest and best ser-
vice to users of the library? I do
not think it would. -

Library Bans
Chicago Paper

Committee Votes Tribune
‘Not Worthwhile’

“The Chicago Tribune is not being
taken in the Grinnell college library
this year partly because of economy
glidi'izdrtls: because the.llbrary_com:
mittee does not consider the Chicago
Tribune a worthwhile newspaper to
keep in the iibmry," said Charles E,
Payne, professor of history and
chairman of the faculty library com-
mittee, when interviewed last night.

Miss Isabelle Clark, librarian, said
that the list of publications to be in-
cluded at the library this year has
not been completed. At the present
time newspapers included are the
same as those of last year with the
exception of the Chicago Tribune and
some foreign publications.

The Des Moines Register, New
York Times, Christian Science Moni-
tor, Manchester Guardian Weekly,
and London Times Weekly are now
available in the library.

Mr. Payne did not indicate what
the committee considered not "worth-
while" ‘in the Chicago Tribune. _Edi-
torially, it 'is generally known to be
militaristic and anti-Volstesd.

Memberslof the library committee
are Mr. Payne, chairman; Elias
Blum, professor of theory of music;
William H. Mack, professor of Eng
lish; Leo P. Sherman, professor of
chemistry, and Miss‘ Clark.

House Chairmen to Assist
in Securing Open Stacks

The council of house chairmen vot-
ed Thursday night to cooperate in
encouraging students to make prop-
er use of the library stacks if they
are opened in response to recent re-
quests to the faculty. student offie
cers agreed to take any measures
necessary to prevent abuse of stack
privileges.

Building chairmen also continued
to emphasize their policy of uniform
ouiet hours throughout the dormi-
tories after 7:30 p. m. on study
nights. This is the first time that the
six buildings have observed the ‘samc
study hours. '

Dewitt McCroary and Alfred Con-
ard were named to a committee
which will seek the co-operatiou of
the Grinnell park commission or the
country club in establishing a skat-
ing rink here this winter.

Sells Chosen President
of New French Club Here

Dorothy Sells'was elected presi-
dent of the newly formed French
club at its first meeting Friday aft-
ernoon at the home of George 0.
Seiver, professor of French. other
officers elected are: vice president,
Roberta Stcnberry; secretary, Helen
Larrabee, and social chairman, Maude

 

Towl.

"Four years of experience in a li-
brary has convinced me that open
stacks do not result in the best ser-
vice. If a library is to give service
to the public, be able to deliver books
on call at a moment's notice or else
inform the borrower where the book
is and when it can he obtained, it is
necessary to have every book in its
place at all times or correctly charg-
ed out. To open the stacks makes
this impossible.
Colbert Likes Closed Stacks

"Books become disarranged on the
shelves, are taken off the stacks and
placed on tables in the stack room,
and of course in that case are neither
in their proper place nor charged out.
To all intents and purposes the books
might as well be lost for the time
being, for when a call for such books
is made at the desk the librarians
either cannot find them or consume
a great deal of time looking for
them. The person wanting the books
is not given the prompt service to
which he is entitled." '

Paul Spcucor Wood,-professor of
English: “In my mind there is no
debate on the desirability of opening-
the stacks to students. The question
is of protecting the books from being
stolen, and until such a method is ar-
ranged the students will be forced to
operate under the present system."

Clark Wants Modification

Isabelle Clark, librarian: ..“While

I do not think the stacks should be
o all, there should be a modi-

fication’of the present system. In
my opinion, students would not use
the catalog at all if the stacks were
open, and it is impossible to get the
greatest good out of the library with-
out the use of the catalog. The prop-
er use of the system is a little known
art to many of the students, and I
think it is something worthwhile
learning."

, Bruins Lack Power
Despite Illinois Victory

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

ST. LOUI57Washington university
still lacks offensive power although
their defense appeared solid in an
1377 victory over Illinois college last
week. Because of the absence of
speed backs, their offense has not
been fast. Coach Sharpe has not had
to “open up” and is likely to be work»
ing on offensive, which Will not be
used until the pressure comes.

During the last week Dr, Sharpe
announced the appointment of Van—
dever and Wheeler, Cocsptzjns of the
team. This was done because of the
failure of Ted Saussele, oaptaimelect
for this year‘s team, to return to
school. The coaching staff is not op—
posed to a single captain, but wants
to get the best results from the
men. Sharpe feels that an election
held now would lead to dissension
among the players.
