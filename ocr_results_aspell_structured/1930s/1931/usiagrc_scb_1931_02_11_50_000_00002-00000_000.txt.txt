PAST THE DRIVING RANGE

There is scarcely ally line which a student
dares not cross, Given a dcfinitc limit, an adoles-
cent collegial) is likely to pass that limit, even
though for no other rcason than because it is a
limit.

Lines of stones along the driveways ill back
of the men’s dormitories have proved insufficient.
The freshmen were asked to collect lbosc stones
to serve as :l border for the drive. For a time they
operated efficiently. Thcn the snow cove ed the
stones and hinTicd students folllld it ea or to
drive out wherever they chose rlllhor than where
the road had been place . '

The road leading to (lie dormitories isn’t good,
to he sure. It is rougher than any stretches which
most travelers ﬁnd in going liundre s of miles.
Driving across the campus, however, will not help
matters.

Eventually lh may be a paved drive to
the dormitories. D ivilig across the grounds will
then lose its attraction for owners of collegiate
cars. Until that time comes it will cost little ill our
expense and in time to follow the driveway.

College officials have asked student coopcrrr
lion in keeping cars in the cinder roadways. They
have not been arbitrary but have silnply asked co-
operation. Students should be willing to give that
without the threat of a penalty for failure to ob
serve a decent respect for property.

'NEWS ABOUT GRINNELLIANS

The printing of college news is primarily the
purpose of The Scarlet find Black, and .rlctivit s
of students, faculty members, and alumni of Grim
nell college are reported ill on unprejudiccd style.
The fact that o Grinnell professor gives it talk at.
a meeting of the college Young Men’s Christian
association, or delivers the morning scrmon rat the
Ottumwa Congregational church, is news to the
rcflde'rs of Tllc Scarlet and Black. It is because of
the ”who” rather than the “where” that makes
this of college interest.

Advance announcements of lllc members of the
faculty who spoke at the Grinncll Congregational
church were published in The Scarlet and Black
bccuusc thc notices were college news. Should
Grinncd professors have delivered sermons at any
of the other local churches stories similar to those
printed about the Cong :ltional would have up
pearch in the college newspaper.

The administration of Grinnoll college does
not dictolc the policies of The Scarlet and Black,
and consequently the stands taken by the two are
not required to be identical. The Griluicll paper is
published by students, although an attempt has
been made this your to print news of interest to
both the student body find the faculty.

The Scarlet mid Black docs not regret the “so
molly” columns it has given to the Congregational
church, especially to the news printed before find
after the recent arrival of the Rev. Robert W.
Inglis, (ax-’22. Mr. Inglis i it forch Grinncll col-
lege man, and the activit' s of any present or
former Grinncllifln arc of college intcrcst and have
in proper place in the college newspaper.

THE LEFT WING AGAIN

‘ There has been a move on foot lllllollg the men
of the college recently, to secure better outing con~
diliol ‘. A group has chosen to look for improve-
ment by going to cftting places other than the
dormitory dining room. All effort has been made
to form a deﬁnite club ilnd through this organizer
lion to secure reduced rates at some cdfc or toll
room in town.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

men's dorluilor is patent. but those, in charge of
the dining room f c doing all in their p0\\’(:l' to im-
prove conditions. Furlll ' improvements must orlgr

In". .
i The cfforls of h group toward hcttcr coildi
(inns :lrc oomlncndablc and are welcomed as ind'
cation of an awakening consciousness on he pl
of a considerable group that dining cond oils are
not the best, and that something can be done to
improve them, It is to be hoped, however, that this
progressive group will silty within the dormitories
mid lend its efforts toward improvcmcnts within
the walls. ,

Let the progrc sivcs work ill and through the
dorlni lics rather than break nwrly from lhenl,
thus giving the rest, of the students opportunity to
l\(‘lp in winning the cooperation of thc group as
21 whole and to enjoy with them the fruits of that
cooperation.

SHOULDERING YOUR EDUCATION

Deon Melldcll of Yule university recently an-
nounced that Yale has adopted several changes in
the college curriculum, wllicll will go into effect
next year. These changes have for their purpose
the emphasis of method and tho mastery of the sub-
ject, rather than the acquisition of ii ccrtzllll linin-
bcr of points or credits. ‘ ‘

New requirements for degrees, abolition of
mid-year examinations, inauguration of three
reading periods throughout the academic your, and
L‘Cl'lr’lill changes in the general method of instruc-
tion are ille features of the new system. . . .

All this will lend to place thc responsibility
and iniliativc for a comprehensive and pliable
education more dircclly on the shoulders of the
individual students. Al. the some lilnc it should
weed out a certain class of people wllo go to col»
lege, but are not lhcrc primarily for study.

Higher education has become so accessihlc
lhal: CC'I'iZlill privileges are constantly bcing ahuSr
ed3 thereby proving detrimental to those who sin-
ccrcly labor for the right education. If Yfllc,
wllosc standards are above the average, sees fit
to make these changes to remedy the situation,
surely other institutions whose problem is not so
acute might well follow the example.

THINGS NOT AS THEY SEEM
(From the Daily Iowan)

Professor Edward A. Steiner of Grinnell college
went to Oberarnrnergau to see the passion play, expect-
ing a performance of vast spiritual sigiifiecnce. All
that he saw was permeated so much with gross com-
mercialism that it was rendered ineffective.

On his return home he stopped in New York, and
expecting merely a commercial form of entertainment,
went to see Marc Connelly’s popular play, "Green Pas»
tures." out of this mixture of Biblical narrative and
everyday Negro life came the spiritual refreshment
vainly sought in a trip abroad especially for the purpose.

Life is like that. Very often it is necessary to go
to other than the traditional sources for things desired.
A process by which students are forced to absorb
pedantic displays day after day is a poor method of
obtaining an education. Usual forms of entertainment
are often extremely boring if viewed with any dis-
crimination at all. The strongest sermons are not
necessarily found in churches. Beauty and truth and joy
and goodness are often found in places where their ex-
istanee is least suspected.

Fortunately, the intelligent. observant person can
obtain inspiration from elsewhere when the usual forces
fail to produce the expected results.

INSURING COLLEGIATE FLIVVERS
(From the Cedar Rapids Gazette)

The administration of Iowa State college at Antes
has addressed a questionaire to parents of 600 under-
graduates of the institution aslring for their views on
a proposal to require students owning automobiles to
carry liability insurance. More than one-third of the
queries already have been answered, and the replies
indicate that parents are overwhelmingly in favor of
the proposal, which would affect all students at the

state college.
“We do not wish to add any burden to the students

who operate cars," John M. Shaw, personnel direotor
of the college, said, “but we feel that they, as well as
those who do not operate ears, should be protected
in case of accident."

The proposed insurance requirement probably will
meet with the approval of all parents or students at
Amos, and it might well be considered by other educa-
tional institutions in Iowa. Many colleges have pro»
hibited students from operating automobiles while at~
tending school. That restriction seems more drastic than
conditions warrant. The proposal of the administration
at Ames undoubtedly will be more of a protection for
parents than for students. Some students buy and oper-
ate decrepit ears at school without the knowledge of
their parents. Regarding the ears as of little value, the
students often opera/ta them recklessly. When they have
accidents, their parents must pay the bills. The parents

then hold resentment against the college authorities for
What appears to he lax regulation of student life.

Requiring students to carry liability insurance
might discourage the operation of battered ears no
longer ﬁt to be on the streets. Al, least ii. would increase
the expense of operating a car to the point where the
student would regard his responsibility somewhat more
seriously. Aside from these special considerations, any
move tending to increase the responsibility Df motorists
driving cars on Iowa streets and highways is worthy
of support.

Budrunas Scores 9 Poinls
in Minute to Beat Crinnell

(Speciitl to Tile Scarlet mill mach)

MILWAUKEE — A burst of scor-
ing by Walter (Whitey) Budrunas,
Marquette university center, enabled
Bill Chandler’s Blue and Gold bass
keteers to get the jump on the Grin—
nell college Pioneers here Saturday
night and coast home to a 33 to 22
victory.

After both teams had gone score»
less in the first two minutes, Bud»
runes cut loose and in the brief spell
of 55 seconds accounted for nine of
Marquette's points for the night. His
first goal was a onerhamled push
shot from so feet out.

Douglas opens for Grinneli

He followed the next tipoff with a
pot shot, and went in to get his own
long shot off the hacirhoard to tip in
the third. The Hilltop longboy drib-
bled in for the next ringer and made
it. He was fouled in the attempt
and made good on the free throw lto
round out his 55rsecolld spree.

From then on, John Truesdale‘s
men began to show their form and
it was a battle all (the way. Ben
