By MARGUEKITE KONECNY

By a score of 1 to o the Bull team
defeated th Bear team in the first
night exbih ion hockey game to be
played by picked teams of Grinnell
women on Word field last night.

The game was featured by the of-
fensive work of Dorothy Perry, Bull
forward, and the goal guarding of
Becky Miller and Nettie Hanson.
Perry's ability to follow up the ball
and maneuver it through tight places
won her individual honors. This is
her first year of participation in
hockey. Both Miller and Hanson,
goalkeepers for the Bears and the
Bulls, respectively, did some good
blocking.

Hackett stars

Among the other players who
stood out were Hackett, Bear for-
ward, who at several times took the
ball down the field herself but who
had little backing, and R. Horine and
E. McFall of the backfield who

handled the work of feeding the ball[

to the line ahead. Snavely, hight half
for the bulls, accnmplihhed some heat
interference.

At the first of the game the Bulls
Carried the ball deep into the Bear
territory and most of the playing cen-
tererl there throughout the first half.
The Bulls were constantly threaten-
ing, but their only goal came during
the first 10 minutes of play when E.
Redbum, center forward, drove the
ball between the posts.

Second Half Even

During the second half the posses-
sion of the ball was nearly evenly di-
vided, but both teams neglected to
.take advantage of the larger field
and the passing was too much in the
center instead of to the wings. 0n
the whole, the forward line of the
Bears functioned more as a unit than
'that of their opponents.

Richards captained the winning
team, Hackett, the losers. Referees
were Miss Leone Crosby and Florence
Cole; timekeeper, H. Brackney; and
scorekeeper, H, Dieman.

Honor G Sponsors

The game was sponsored by the
Women’s Honor G- cluh which Will
use the proceeds in a. fund which will
bring representative high school
girls here as guests of the organiz-
ation in the spring.

New Circuit
in State Likely

Valley Loop Satisfactory

for Grinnell

“We are wcll satisfied where we
are, and to my knowledge any talk
of Grinnell's jmning any conference
other than the Missouri Valley 2‘—
Etends no further than our being i -
kvited to join," said John C. Trues~
dale, director of athletics. here, to—
day, when confronted with a proposed
new Iowa conference which included
Grinnell.

The proposal, incorporated in a
news dispatch to The Scarlet and
Black, suggested a conference includ-
ing Coe and Cornell colleges from
the Midwest conference, Simpson and
State Teachers colleges from the
Iowa conference. and two other col-
leges, Luther, Momingside, and Grin.
nell being suggested as possibilities.

“While other institutions in the
conference are larger than Grinnell."
said Coach Truesdale, "scores in all
sports show that we are not out of
our class of competition. The only
possibility of a change is that of
strengthening the present circuit by
ion addition which is talked of from
time to time."

The new conference, if formed, will
take two of the strongest Midwest
contenders out of that loop. while
State Teachers has managed to rank
among the leaders of the Iowa con-
ference consistently.

Final Game
on Schedule

for Pioneers

Bulldogs Score Touchdown
at Close of Half;

Thomas Stars

Led by a quarterback who left the
hospital to play three quarters of the
annual Drake—Grinnell football game
at Des Moines Saturday, Grinnell
college's gridmen found going a little
tough and lost, 6 to U. The Bulldogs
pushed over their touchdown just has
fore the gun sounded to close the
first half. ‘
To the credit of the pioneers, they
outfought nun outsmarted the heav-
ier Bulldogs aggregation several
times in the dnnger zone, bllt their
efforts were of little use when the
muddy field handicapped the Grin-
nell air attack.

Thomas Stars Again
Playing with his back in bad shape.
Thomas was necessarily cautious, His
off—tackle smashes might have gain-
ed ground had he been able to play
at top speed. His punting outdistanc-
ed that of Drake kickers, and his
passing, despite the mud. was re-
sponsible for most Grinnell gains.
Late in the first quarter. Drake
carried the ball to the Pioneer 3-yard
line for a first down. Three plunges
at the line were stopped and on the
fourth play Grinnell forwards broke
through to smear thc ball-carrier for
a loss and Grinnell took the hall on
downs.

Thompson Scores

The Drake score followed a lateral

pass play, Goodwin to Thompson,
which carried the ball to within less
than a yard of the Grinnell goal, The
Des Moines players were forced back
on the next play, but Thompson hit
left tackle again to cross the line.
The kick for point was low.
The Pioneers first chance to score
came after the beginning of the sec-
ond half, when two passes, one to
Graflund for 20 yards and another
to Duncan for 13 placed the ball on
the Bulldog 25~yard line. Thomas
then skirted Drake’s right end on a
fake pass, being stopped at the 14
yard line.

The Drake line halted further
attempts and the Pioneers did not
threaten again until the middle of
the fourth quarter, when a pass to
Alexander was good for 25 yards,
0n the next play, a spot pass over
center, the ball bobbed out of Dun-
can's arms into the hands of Seiber—
ling and from that point on, Drake
held the upper hand to finish on top.

Big Weight Handicap

A swarming mass of Drake play—
ers made life' miserable for the Pion<
eers, who were outweighed 14 pounds
to the man in the line, and although
