Grinnellians seek Revenge
Friday at 4 o'Cloek;
Baker Returns

(Special to The Scarlet and Black)

DES MOINEsionly 10 men form
the Drake university swimming team
which will meet Grinnell' college for
the second time this season Friday in
the Pioneer natatorium.

The Bulldogs won from their Mis-
souri Valley rivals in a meet at Des
Moines earlier in the season, 59 to
24. Drake lost only one event, that
being the 440ryard swim which Miller
of Grinnell won.

Coach A. ‘1. "Scotty" Russell's
team, since that date, has chalked up
wins over Creighton university and
the University of Nebraska. The Blue
jays were easlly subdued, 49 to 35,
but the Combuskers went down only
after a bitter battle, Drake winning
by three points, 44 to 41.

Nose Out Nebraska

Baker, free style artist, accounted
for the last local victory by nosing
out his rival in the ﬁnal event, the
medley relay. The Bulldog paddler.

dual by illness, won from the Big

Big Business Force Topic
of Address by J. P. Ryan
at Y. M. C. A. Tomorrow

The Young Men's Christian asso-
ciation will hold its regular bieweekly
meeting tomorrow evening in the
dormitory dining room. The program
will resume the regular series, which
was interrupted by the Christmas
holidays and the Gates lectures.

Dinner will be served to the mem-
bers in the dining room at the regu-
lar hour. After dinner, Prof. J. P.
Ryan, head of the speech depart-
ment, will talk on the subject of big
business as the controlling force in
this country, and how it may be em-
ployed even more profitably than
socialism, ,

Mr. Ryan’s theme, on the whole,
will be the other side of the picture
pi- sented by Harry F. Ward when
he spoke here three weeks ago.

Music and entertainment will also
be a part of the program.

to Swim Here

Tumbling lrnprovesDancing,
Flattens Out Curves
of Coeds Here

If you could glance into the wom—
en-s quadrangle at Grinnell college
about 10:30 at night, you probably
would see a number of coeds either
walking through the halls on their
hands, standing on their heads in cor-
ners, or turning cartwheeis.

No, they are not just jubilant over
the approach of Spring! They are
members of a recently
class in tumbling. Nor does this
mean that they are planning to join
some circus as acrobats, but it does
mean that it will improve their
dancing, and as a general tonic and
reduceriwell, it is difficult to find
something that will beat tumbling in
that respect.

‘Tone Up Health’

So, if you wish to become a more
graceful dancer or to flatten out a
few curves, tone up the health, and
give your skin a clear, fresh tone,
take the advice of Miss Leone Crosby,
instructor in swimming and tumbling
at Grinnell, and learn to turn somer-
saults, bandsprlngs, and cartwheels.

and Morniiigside college, Sioux
City, Winnifred Neilson, Marguerite

to Grinncll feeling that the rules of
thc womcn's self»g’overnment organ-
ization here arc more lenient than at
any of thcsc institutions. The Grim
nell women debated at the three col-
leges last week. Plans of govern-
ment, similar to Grinnell's system,
have been established at the three
schools. Each has its women's
board, men’s board, and a body cor-
responding to the Grinnell student
council, student government at the
University of South Dakota, however,
is not influential.

Than Those Seen by Debaters

It has a student senate composed
of the pi 'dcnts of the different res-

of representatives from each of the
fraternities and sororities, In case
of the pcrpctration of major offeuscs,
the senate suggests a penalty, with
the dean dcci rig upon the final ac;
tion. Soro es and fraternities
make their rules individually.

Regarding smoking by women, one
sorority visited by the Grinncll rep
resentatives permits members to
smoke in their own rooms.

A student representative board
composed of members from every de—
partment of the school acts as a stu-

Kansas Game Cancelled
in the first encounter this season
between the two teams, Creighton
nosed out Grinnell by the precarious
margin of 30 to ‘26. Since that time
the Omahans have met with mediocre
success. losing to Marquette and the
University of Missouri twice, split—
ting a two-game series with the Okla-
homa Aggies and Syracuse, and de-
feating Iowa State and Drake.

A game with the Kansas Aggies,
scheduled for Feb. 14, was cancelled
because of the death of President
William H. Agnew, S. J., of Creigh-
ton on the previous day.

Early Lead Against Drake.

In Monday night's affair with the
Drake Bulldogs, Creighton opened up
a vicious attack that sent them into
an early lead, which they never re-
linquished. Although the contest
threatened to take on football pro»
portions and characteristics at sev-
eral times, plenty of speed and fight
gave the fans a spectacle which
pleased them well, and furnished
Creighton supporters renewed hope
that the conference championship, or
at least a part of it, might be an-
nexed by the Jays for the third cons
