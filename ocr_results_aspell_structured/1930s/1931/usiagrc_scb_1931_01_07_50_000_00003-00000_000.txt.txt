back in Grinnell, the fastest moving
little college in the state, after your
sojourn in outlying districts. We
know Grinnell with its warm and
balmy breezes, its good home-cook—
ing, and its smart night clubs must
appeal to you after the desolation of
the provinces. Well, anyhow, its
mighty, mighty restful.

Dick is a boy from New England,

And he’s one valve that isn't

He know: every cute girl in college,

And has every one laid low;

By his voice so caressing he coaxes,

By his words so pleading and low,
He makes every girl he encounters,

Think that she's quite the whole

show.
