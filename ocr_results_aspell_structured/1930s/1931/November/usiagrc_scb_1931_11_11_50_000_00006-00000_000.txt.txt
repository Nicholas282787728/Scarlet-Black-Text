A VOTE FOR 158 GRINNELLIANS

As faculty meetings are the place for fllcult)‘
members to express their opinion and trustee
meetings for the trustees to do likclvi, . so studcnt
council meetings arc the place for the expression of
student opinion.

Thrce integral parts constitute student opin-
ion; quadrangle women, dormitory men, and town
students. Under the present constitution of the
colulcil (which exists only ill effect since it has
been lost), the president of the women’s lcaguc
board represents all the Grinncll women and the
president of the council of house chairmen rcprce
sents all Grinnell mcn, theoretically.

But fallacy exists between theory and reality.
For the league board president lives in the quad-
rangle where she is informed of quadrangle opine
ion and the president of the council of house chairs
men lives in the dormitories in contact with the
views of dormitory men. But it does not follow
that the views of the town students are the some
as those of the quadrangle and dormitory students.
It has been often proved that the minority is in
the right.

Town students necd and desire a icpresenta-
tive of their own choice. Such a, representative
would have kindred problems and ll kindred view-
point. To hilll they could go to present their views
on campus matters Without first having to explain
the backgroulid of their opinions:

Present members of tllc council are all quads
ranglc and dormitory residents. That is natural
because their opportunity to be known by the
students who elect them is for grcater than that
of isolatcd town students. This fact gives the coune
cil o thoroughgoing quadrallgle-dorlnitory view-
point. But docs it follow that the 158 Grinncll
students not in (L position to will offices are neces
sarily without able lcddcrs, tool Town students
are a part of Grillnell college as lnuch ils the 600
college residents are, but they have no direct voice
and vote in the body which considers the problems
of the entire student body.

_—G—
THE FIRST AUDIT PROPOSAL

Members of committees investigating the pro
posed central auditing System for Grinnell college
organizations have recently asked the opinion of
Tllc Sam at and Black on the proposition. The
answer U in the fact that The S .drlct and Black
was the fi St campus organization to suggest the
audit.

In an editorial, “Central Auditing Necessary,”
published March 21 and signed by the present cdi-
tor of The Scarlet and Black, the newspapcr said,
“Every business house depends upon accurate ac-
counts and there is no logical reason wlly Grins
nell organizations Should not operate in the some
fashion.”

Ill suggesting such an audit, the editorial pros
posed a. plan which “would not serve in any way
to approve or disapprove expenditure but would
simply serve as all did to keep books bdlonccd
and to give llcw officers on cxflct accounting of
the standing of the books at the time they take
their posts. It would benefit the treasurers and
business managers in relieving from tllcm any
stigma of dishonesty or graft which Dame Rumor
is apt to foster as long as the books are not cllcckcd
by some disinterested party. It would benefit incr-
chants in their credit systems, for they wollld be
able to follow, the financial standings of organizdt
tions and, once they were in the ‘rcd’, could rc-
fusc tllcln crcdi . This move would be an adequate
heel: on expenditures without any approvals or
disdpprovflls."

Other advantages of the system were pointed
out and. the editorial closed with the statement,
“A control audit would aid the merchants, the

in sill-cl and bu llcs manager college officials
and thc ,studcnts thclllsclvcs. Its establishment is
worth consideration at least.”

The stutlcut council, Lzlutcl'n, and other lends

rumpus groups have rluun well in lzlkillg up

arc to ho. congratulated. llut has The Scarlet and

IS THIS WASHINGTON'S TROUBLE?
(From the student Life)

Through some misinterpretation of things we have
said, the student body has evidently come to the cone
clusion that student Life is working to push our stand-
ards of football even lower than they are now. Let
us state plainly—Student Life wants Washington Uni-
versity to have a good football team and will do all
within its power to get one. We are in sympathy, how-
ever, with the administration in that football players
should not be bought, that is, players given jobs that
require little effort and yet net 3. good income. We feel,
as does the majority of the students, that scholarships
should be provided for those men who have athletic
ability if they are fair students and are good citizens
of the campus.

We, along with most interested students, are trying
to get at the bottom of the difficulty and find out why
we don’t have a better team. We frankly admit that we
are blindly groping and do not feel that we have yet
bit on the solution of all our troubles. We feel that a
complexity of circumstances makes up the bad situa-
tionieach little thing adds its little bit. Our condemna-
tion of the newspapers and alumni was sincere in that
the dailies are helping build up prejudice against Wash-
ington in the minds of St. Louisans and some alumni
are running the school down before prospective students
when they should he boosting it. And we should have
afternoon games.

Another thing that is doing a great deal of harm
and further hindering us from reaching our goal, is the
attitude of the nthletic department, and frankly, with
due respect for his position, Head Coach Dr. Sharpe.
The men out there are defeatistkthey are licked before
they start. Football has become the bane of their exis»
tence instead of the joy of their life. They complain
they have no material, students don’t support them
whatever they do, they confide in reporters that Wash-
ington hasn’t got. a chance, that football out here is a
thing of the past. Dr. Sharpe openly admits that his
“reputation is shot," that whatever he does is frowned
upon by everybody. We wonder if he thinks that he
was hired as coach to have men come out on the field
and teach themselves how to play football, that students
will recognize his ability without his proving it, and
that. whatever he does is right regardless of the effect?

Dr. Sharpe came to us from Cornell, where football
was an established traditionithere were plenty of big
men, fast men, and clever men available that only had
to be taught to work together to produce a team, Down
here things were different~a football team had to be
hewn out of the rough, not: merely touching the boys
how to play after they came out, but actually awaken
ing them from their lethargy and showing them the
advantages of playing football. Dr. Sharpe was lln<
doubtedly warned of the situation, but for four years
there have been men in school capable of playing foot-
ball but haven’t, because Dr. Sharpe hasn’t convinced
them of its value. That was his job speciﬁcally.

Statements issued to the papers this year that.
Washington Won't win such-and-such a game unless
they get the breaks was bad taste. Even if it were true,
it is the athletic department's business to radiate op-
timismistuuents and faculty may condemn but the
coach should remain firm in his hopes for victory, in-
stead of telling the boys to see by how little they can
lose

This defeatlst attititude has done us much to ruin
athletics here as anythingiDr. Sharpe ‘lays the team
is going to lose; it appears in the papers that be said
that; is St. Louis going to come to see a team play when

coach publicly states that his team hasn’t a chance?
Americans believe what they read in newspapers and
they like to see a winner.

We're not sitting down here in our little offlce
griping about everything—we're as anxious as anyone
to have a team and We’re merely pointing out the
difficulties that stand in the way. And the attiude of

 

the athletic department is one of the greatest.

Dear Sir:

Nov. 11 has become on internation-
al rkty to commemorate the signing
of the Armistice, and yet after only
13 years, we may almost have for-
gotten. At least we give no indicflr
tron of our knowing.

The day is not for the glorification
of war, but for the recognition of
peace. Our country, our state, our
community, observed in some manner
or other the purpose of this special
occasion.

On the campus, however, there was
hardly any distinction between Nov.
11 and any other autumn day. The
hanging of the flag in the chapel.
which to be sure is unusual, was the
only thing of differing appearance.

While the community and the na—
tion were paying a prayful respect
to the World's dead in facing east at
the hour of 11 am, the school as a
whole, and to my knowledge, no class
in particular, suspended its activities
for even one minute to consider the
merits of the Armistice.

If one had sufieient outside con-
tacts, he might perchance be drawn
into the spirit of the day. But would
a college assembly at 11 o’clock, a
chapel talk, or a minute in class de-
voted to this memorial be more than
fair to Crinnellians “who gave their
last full measure of devotion," and
to those of us who do ~ have this
outer Contact?

If those desiring peace would but
recognize its present status, and
realize that the means of its prac
tical furtherance lies through a sp it
of governmental unity to be develop-
ed along with the rest of the nation,
then we would not be wondering if
we have forgotten.

Yours truly,
J. Richard Sneed.

Dear Sir:

About a year ago a Japanese stur
dent, Mr. Kobnyashi, left on Prof.
Mitchell Dreese‘s desk a book of
Japanese pictures. Almost immedir
ntely the book disappeared, and has
never been found. Consider a mom-
ent. This book was a gift to Mr. Ko-
bayaslli from friends in Japanihis
most precious memento of the home—
land. It was to have been his com-
forter and friend. it cannot be dupli-
cated or replaced. Mr. Kobayashi
confided to me late last spring his
bitter sense of loss. He will long re-
member Grinnell. 1f anyone can in
any way arrange for the return of
the book, r am sure that any reason-
able cost: can he met. The present
situation is a permanent blot on the
name of our college.

Yours truly,
Henry S. Canard
