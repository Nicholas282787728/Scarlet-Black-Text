Grinnell Again
Wins Carnegie
Art Fellowship

The Carnegie corporation’s fellow-
ship in fine arts has been awarded to
Grinnell college again, Miss Luella .1.
Read, dean of women and professor
in art, winning it for study at Har-
vard university this summer. Grim-
nell was the first college to be given
the award when the fellowship was
established several years ago.

The fellowship, which maintains
special summer school courses at a
number of the best art schools in the
country, provides traveling expenses.
room, board, tuition, and an addition-
al fund out of which the institution re-
ceiving the award may purchase
books, paintings, and other equipment
for the art department.

The reason given for the selection
of Grinnell was that in proportion to
the enrollment; the larger number of
students were enrolled in art courses
here than in any college in the Coulis
try.

Miss Read, who will leave for Cam-
bridge, Mass, early in July to spend
six weeks at Harvard, will study
courses in American architecture, art
appreciation, and the decorative arts.
She will also purchase some new
equipment for the Grinnell depart-
ment.
