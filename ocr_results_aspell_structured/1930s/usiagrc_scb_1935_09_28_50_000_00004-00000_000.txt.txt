IS ANY ONE SURE?

As the threat of war in Europe becomes
daily more and more eminent, the college stu-
dents of America are faced with the problem
of what will their attitude he, should this coun-
try be drawn into the conflict.

Lending authorities declare that for Alnelu
ice to remain neutral is an ilnpossihilit If
this he so, then the college students are indeed
facing a grove crisis. The futility of war needs
no cxpounding, but whether or not the millions
of students in college, who have learned this
fact, will put their knowledge into effort re-
mnins to be seen.

Last spring there was organized a student
strike against war as on expression of the role
lege students’ attitude. At that time doubt
was 'pressed as to the real value of the strike.
Opinion was divided and nothing really (lefie
nite was ascertained.

However zls the throat of war becomes
more and more real the question of attitude
again arises. This time there will not be a penf'e-
fnl state in which to take a stand, but instead.
if war comes, all the modern agencies of None
agnnda, so effectively used in the lost wllr. will
be brought into action, public condemnation of
those opposed to war will be great, while pose
sions will run high, and the out ion arises
will college students be able to withstand this
onslllught of pressure” Will they carry out
their opposition to war as effet ely in the
midst of a notion preparing for war, as they
did ill the midst of ft nation at peace. and pl'tL
occupied with other matters?

We sincerely hope that the college sine
dents, the intelligentsia of tomorrow, will cure
ry out their opposition to lhe I'L‘ul thing in the
same spirit ill wh' h they have been opposing
the more abstract peace tilnc concept of war.
We hope that this will come to pt and that
the days of mfiSS subjugation by propngnndn
are at on and, but we are not Slll't‘. ls anyone?

WATCH YOUR STEP

Keep off the grass is certainly a tritc cxe
pression, yet nercrtlmlc. it is u stntenlcllt to
which trillucll students would do well to pay
attention, espo ally when they are hm '
to the post other to get that eagerly awaited
ll ivc from the one they left behind.

Grinnoll has long lloen known for the
beauty of its rumpus and no small port of this
reputation has been derivrd from the grccuncs
of the turf However, one port of the gl s ha.
been “tolling n tcrrlfir, heating” at the fret
of the illoulzlltles. who use the short cut to
the post office from the doors of Alumni Rrrie
lotion hall.

Lust year it was necessary to fence oi‘l’thal
particular stretch of ground in order to permit

 

THE GRDTN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the grass to gain roots. and if the strident body
does not heccl its steps, such an unsightly fence
undoubtedly will again be ill evidence.

\Vutcll \‘Olll' steps, the long oxpet’tcd mis-
slrc can u lt for another two or three minutes,
but the gl on the campus cannot stand the
abuse of daily tl'ulllplinrts.

0N WRITING LETTERS HOME.
(Daily O'Collegian)

“Don’t forget to write at least once a week."
Nine times out of ten these are the parting words
of parents as they leave their sons and daughters
at the doors of their residences at college.

And nine times out of ten the sons and daugh-
tcrs faithfully intend to write home at least once a
Week. And they do write home for a while on
schedule. Bu it 'sn't long until the average student
finds friends, activities and maybe studies so inter-
esting that the memories of home and parents
begin to fade. It begins to become a duty rather
than n plcnsure to pen a letter to mother and dad.
The letters are padded withnlot of useless material
—material that fills up space and hides that which
the folks are really interested in—the real experi-
ences and emotions of the writer.

Boys and girls are too prone to wait until the
pocketbook becomes bare to write a honeyed letter
home. And in these letters they usually put a
padded expense account in which four or five dol-
lars is tacked onto the cost of books and other items
are run up accordingly, they being too afraid to
tell dsd exactly where the money went. Girls,
believe it or not, are as guilty of this as are the
boys.

Students coming to college move into a world
of their ownia world in which many harum-scamm
activities are permitted that would be deﬁnitely
taboo any other place. Many of the students be-
come so buried in this world that the only connec—
tion they have and try to maintain vu'th the outside
world is their check from home.

But parents who send their children off to
college find no new world to take up their interests.
Their children are asrreal to them as ever. especially
if they have to sacrifice many comforts and perhaps
luxuries to give little Johnnie and Mary a higher
education.

Little Johnnie and Mary should remember this
factithat although mey may have lost some inter-
est in mother and dad, dad and mother haven‘t lost
interest in them. They are everything to mother
and dad.

A letter on time—something that takes little
effort yet means a lotiis little enough for the nrdi.
nary college student to do to repay the folks back
home. And a letter once in a while is all the
ordinary parents ask.

THE GREAT GOD PUBLICITY

(Daily Trojan)

Oh my. oh my!

It's amazing the things that Hollywood and its
inmates, encouraged by the hysterical press, will do
in the worship of the great god publicity, Now Don
Juan “Caliban" Barrymore stages a marathon
crosscmmtry dodge to avoid his “Ariel," the 19-
year-cld “protege."

Of course it makes great copy for the news
paper sob sister and her male counterpart, and of
course it keeps the name of the great lover before
the eyes of what he hopes IS the movieegoing pub-
lie, but it: slightly nauseating to see this silly
twaddle given equal prominence with the latest
news of world-wide importance, from Ethiopia.
Rome. andoeneva, as well as nationally vital prob
lems '

What difference does it make if I! Duce draws
the entire world into armed conflict, what does it
matter that San Francisco seems faced with an-
other bloody waterfront strike, so long as Caliban
successfully avoids Ariel?

The open defiance of Mussolini when confronted
with the League of Nation’s peace proposal fades
into insignificance when the papers headline: “Bar-
rymorc One Train Up in Love Derby.”

it is impossible to imagine the utter ccstaey
should Elaine catch John and emerge victorious in
the intriguing contest of catch-ns-catch-can, excit—
ingbeyond description, that has gripped millions
of readers throughout our incomparable U. s A,

Or should it be griped?

“Blessed are the open-minded,
for theirs is the kingdom of art, of
sciencc. of philosophy and of nine
sic," This is one way in which
Iohn w. Gannaway. professor of
political science, interpreted
Christ's words. “Blessed are the
poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven."

“By ‘poor in spirit’ Christ didn't
mean a person spiritually whipped,
or one with is broken Spirit,” Mr,
Gsnnaway said. “By these words
he meant the humble, teachnble
and openrminded, an opposed to
the proud and cancelled," be con-
tinued.

Mr. Gannaway stressed the im-
portance of open-mindedness to
day in the tremendous upheaval
in society now taking place. He
declared that it was even more
necessary for the older people than
for the younger ones who are
more capable by nature of making
adjustments.

Friday

Because of an error in arrange-
ments, no program had been
planned for Friday morning. Fill-
ing in the gap, David E. Peck,
professor of violin, led the audie
ence in singing “Sons of Old Grins
hell" and the College Hymn, while
Miss Saran Inness MacDonald, as-
sistant professor of piancforte,
played the organ. A student
chapel had originally been sched-
aled for that morning.

Co-ecls Spend More for
Beauty; Less For Smoking

Minneapolis, Minn. (ACF)—Minr
nesotat statisticians and figure-
hunters have blasted another idea
that is prevalent among collegi-
sns.

Women students spend only 76
cents more per month in beauty
shops than men do in barber
shops! And she spends only a frac-
tion of the amount that men spend
on tobacco.

These figures were revealed in
the results of a survey of the buy-
ing habits at the University of
Minnesota made by an insurance
company. The survey showed that
clothes form the greater part of
the cared's budget, while food is
the largest item in the colleglan's
budget.

Twenty Mount Holyoke college
freshmen will be allowed to take
only two courses this year under
rules set down for a unique edu-
cational experiment there.

Joker in Rules

Nov.

1935 Football Code Contains
Contradictions

Detroit. Mich. (ACPlicoach
Charles E. Dorais of the Unlver—‘
sity of Detroit has discovered a
“joker” in the football rules that
may prove to be more important
than a casual reading of the code
might indicate. It is a supplemen-
tal note to Section 7, Rule 7, cov-
ering the dead ball and it reads:

“A runner who is on his feet
even though he be held by an op‘-
ponent may run, pass, or kick un-
til the whistle blows."

This is an apparent contradic-
tion of the body of the mile which
reads:

“The ball is dead when a player
in possession and control of the
ball goes out of bounds, cries
‘down' or is so held that his for-
ward progress is stopped or (ex-
cept the holder of the ball in n ,
placerkicil) when any portion of
his person except his hands or feet
touches the ground."

As Coach Dorais sees it, much
will depend upon how quickly the
referee blows the whistle when the
ball-carrier is held by an opponent
and is still on his feet. If the refer-
ee is fast with the whistle, it
means that lateral passing will be
greatly curtailed, while lf he is in.
cliued to place a liberal interpreta-
tion on the supplemental note, ltls
going to be possible to pass literal-
ly in a manner never before seen _
on the American college gridiron.

“It may be necessary before
each game to find out from the
rcfeere just how he is going to in-
terpret the rule," he added,
