Thirteen Tanksters Compete
Today for Honors

in Loop.

Finals to Be Tonight

Washington Slated to Nose Out
Drake for First Place
' This Year.

While three representatives of the
track team went to Urbana to up-
hold Grinnell’s honor on the indoor
boards, thirteen men from the tank
squad went to Des Moines to coma
pete with four other teams for the
Missouri Valley swimming honors.
The meet is being held in the Roose-
velt high school pool.

The men who left this mot-hing at
seven o’clock comprise all of the
swimming squad. Captain Dewey, L
Brown, Shernborg, Pitcher. Skoug,
and Risser will swim in the sprints;
Cox and Miller will swim the dis
tances; Thomas and Laustrup will
swim the backstroke; de Persia, De-
Long, and Conard will enter the
breast stroke; DeLong will dive.

Preliminaries were held this morn—
ing at ten o’clock. Finals in all
events will take place at sevenrthil'r
ty this evening.

Washington university will be out
to recapture the title which they lost
last year to Drake. The Bears have
had the edge in swimming for the
past several years and seem to have
the best chances for the title this
year. Their greatest competition
seems to he in Drakc whom how-
ever, they downed in a dual meet
last week. Drake will be handicaps
pcd today by the loss of McClelland,
a star backstroker, and Billick.
sprinter, both of whom had to drop
out because of illness.

Sq r-cs of Drake is expected to
tak thc breaststroke and Brenner
of shington is expected to run him
a close race in that event, Skinner
of Washington, Miller of Grinnell,
and Goldberg of Drake will probably
have a private fight for first place
in the Aioeyard grind,

Grinnell is doped to take places in
almost every c‘vent and will fight for
one of the first three places. Neither
Creighton or Oklahoma have shown
much strength in swimming and are
not expected to be in the running.

About sixty-five men were entered
in the competition lists this morn-
ing.. Oklahoma brought only five
men and Drake had ten. Creighton
had twelve swimmers and Washing—
ton had the largest squad with
twenty.

Kennedy Talks on
Radio and Flying

“Radio is becoming the block sys-
tem of the air; within a few years it
will be possible for a person in a
plane in the air to talk by radio and
telephone to someone on the ground,”
said Mr. K. A. Kennedy, representa—
tive from the Boeing School of Aer-
onautics of Oakland, California, who
Spoke to a group of men in the Lan-
gan Hall clubroom Thursday even—
ing. He discussed briefly the neces-
sity of a thorough technical training
for positions in the air transport
business whether in executive or pilot
jobs.

Through a brief review of various
incidents in the'development of avia-
tion Mr. Kennedy illustrated U19

' necessity of the perfection of instru-
ments used in ﬂying without ground
guidance. He also spoke of recent
inventions and their ultimate place
in making ﬂying absolutely safe.

GRINNELL, IOWA,

Three Pioneers
Enter at Illinois

Douglas, McIlrath, Thomas
Close Indoor Season

for Grinnell.

McIlrath. Thomas and Douglas,
the power section of the Grinnell col-
lege’s indoor track squad closes the
season on the sheltered hoards today
when they compete in the Illinois
meet at Urbana. Coach G. L. Duke
entered only these three men in the
meet but looks for each of them to
rake in a point or two.

Each members of the power trio
has located an event which seems es<
peciaily adapted to his capabilities.
McIlrath does his pacing over a
1,500 meter course, rather than a
mile today, while Thomas sprints
300 yards. Douglas has been entered
in an all around event in an effort
to find just how his variety of abil—
ities could compare with athletes
from other colleges. Doug is han-
dicapped. however since the decatha-
lon does not permit entry in basket-
ball or football.

Closes Season

The meet today closes Grinnell'sin—
door track season._ The Pioneers
started the year with a dismal out-
look; but proved to have unexpected
strength, taking second in the

Drake dual was won handily by the
well balanced Grinnell squad and a

in the

preliminaries and stiff competition in‘

Gl'innell’s strongest numbers the
Pioneers were able to pull together
only four points at the Central In:
ter-collegiate meet at Notre Dame.
Although Coach Duke is certain that
many members of his track team
would hc able to make a good 5110er

only the thrcc men who seem best

Leading Socialist

to Come This Week‘

Clarence Senior, executive sec—
retary of the American Socialist
party, will be in Crinnell Friday,
Saturday. and possibly Sunday of
next wcek, he has recently com-
municated to correspondents here.
Hc will follow up the work of Nor-
man Thomas, 1928 Socialist presi-
dential candidate who was here last
month, and will assist Paul Porter,
field secretary of the League for In-
dustrial Democracy. Mr. Porter, who
addressed chapel, several classes, and
an evening meeting here last spring,
will be here next week to talk at the
Y. W. C. A. conference.

Mr. Senior, in addition to his so-
cioalist wo'rk, is a member of the
War Resisters' League. During the
summer of 1928 he attended a con-
ference of the War Resisters' Inter-
national and the World Youth Peace
congress in Eerde. The Netherlands.
He will be entertained at a luncheon
by the World Fellowship committee
of the Y. M. C. A., and will address
a meeting of others interested either
Saturday or Sunday, according to
present plans.

Bean Draws for
Big Game Issue
of Campus Kitty

Ronald Bean, '29, former art edi-
tor of the Malteaser, and at present
a member of the Montgomery-Ward
art department will he one of the
contributors to the Big Game number
of the Malteascr which will appear
March 20.

A short story by Harold Forrester
entitled “The Big Game" will be one
of the features carrying out the
theme of the issue. In addition,
light verse by Lucille Rathmann and
Charlotte La Rue on various topics
relevant to the athletic idea of the
magazine will be among its contents.
“The Ads Add”, a short parody on
modern advertising by Sylvia Joseph
is another-bf the features of the is-
sue, while Robert Swift and Milton
Holloway have formed a new campus
literary combination comparable to
the famous Beaumont-Fletcher and
in their col-
laborating on "The Climb of the An—
cient 1151170311.” This epic. is a
parody on the Rime of the Ancient
Mariner, and according to the au»
thor's quite outdoes Coleridge's at-
tempt.

Prospects Good
for Frosh Squad

Two Meets; Men Have
High Records.

While it is probable that not more
than twelve or fifteen men will rec
port for freshmen outdoor track this
this number will include says
erol star performers from considerar
tion of their former achievements.
Arrangements are now under way
of two meets for
thc yearling out i . Joe Pojman of
Chicago, a diminutive sprinter, is
outstanding and will more than like
ly take honors in his events. He re»
cently- competed in the freshman
event at the AlnescGrilmell-Drakc
triangular mot and despite a yard
handicap took the event, His timcs
in both the fifty and hundred yard
events point him out as a potential
point winner. other inch who will
probably turn out for the short dis-
tances arc Wolfinger of Des Moines
and Holmes of Omaha. Woltinger
ran on the Roosevelt high mile rec
lay team last year. Holmes, while
not an experienced runner, should
give a good account of himself.

Hare Distance Men

Mason Meyer of Kansas City is a
pole vaulter of considerable merit
and should be able to pull in points
in that event. Virgil Bowlby of
Muscatine and Fred Granund of
Moline, lll. will report for the
javelin throw and the shot put. Both
these men have very creditable high
school records back of them. No
other weight men have yet reported.
Quarter milers include George Rob-
inson of Sterling, Ill., and Harold
Alexander, former Grinnell high
school runner, both of whom have

TANAGER TRYOUTS.

Competition for positions on the
business staff of the Tanager, cam—
pus literary periodical, will be held
from now until the second week af-
ter spring vacation according to an
announcement by Miss Eleanor
Lowden, editor. The competition
will be based on the number of sub-
scriptions received. All are eligible
for this staff, and those interested
will report to Miss Lowden.

 

Honor ‘G’ Grades Better Than Average;
Room-Mates Get Highest, Lowest Marks

Further proof that athletes, at
least at Grinnell, do not rank below
the rank and file of the student
body in scholarship was given today
when figures released from the of-
fice of Dean Beatty showed that both
in average grade points and average
grade 'points per hour, the forty men
of the Honor ‘G’ club rank above
the men of_tbe college taken as a
whole.

Among all the men, the average
number of grade points per student
accumulated last semester was
19.32; Honor ‘G’ men obtained an
average of 21.31. In points per cred-
it hour, Grinnell men averaged 1.275,
while the athletes' average was

1.441. Perhaps this comparison of
the Honor ‘G‘ club with all the men
in college, however, is hardly fair, as
the average of the club was higher
than that of the freshman and sopho-
more mcn, but below that of junior
and senior men. Nevertheless, on
the basis of statistics, the statement
made originally in this account holds
true.

A study of the variation in grade
points received by individual mem-
bers of the club is interesting: it
shows that the lowest number rec
celved was eight, the highest forty-
five, and what is strangest of all,
that these same two men are room-
mates!

Honor G Takes in Five
at Meeting on Thursday

Five new men were made mem»
hers of the Honor G at a meeting of
that organization in the clubroom of
Building Five last Thursday eve-
ning. The new men were initiates
from the basketball and indoor track
squads.

New letter winners in basketball
were DeWitt McCreary and Hamid
Murray, both sophomores, Ed Brown,
who could not be present, will res
ceive his Honor G as manager of the
team.

From the track squad, John Ed-
wards, Dick Murphy. and Duncan
McKenzie became members of the
Honor G. Edwards and Murphy run
the middle distances, and McKenzie
the mile.
