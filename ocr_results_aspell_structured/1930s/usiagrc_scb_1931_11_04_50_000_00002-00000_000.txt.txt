ALLOW FOR HUMAN NATURE

Not long ago the question of the library being
open for at least it Short time on Sundays was
brought up, but no action has been taken. Perhaps
there is the eternal item of expense involved, bllt
two extra hours a week should not make a too
great drain on the budget, especially where a
worthy purpose is involved.

It is well known that, although Grinncll allows
two .days vacation between weeks, the llllljority of
students wait until Sunday to get the preparations
for Monday and Tuesday. Pcrhzlps it is to he dc-
plored, but, as it is all inhcrcnt quality of human
nature the question is not to attempt to change
human nature, but to provide for it as far as is
practical.

The accommodations to such a great number
of students who would welcome such a chnngc
should also influence the administration to the
point where something would be done about allow
ing students to take out books on Sundays.

TEE LOGICAL OPPONENT

One of the best welfare ideas proposed, as far
as local football fans are concerned, is that of a
Grinnell-Iowa Stole charity football gamc ill Des
Moincs after the close of the season. Since the
Big Ten has decided that the University of Iowa
may not appear against the state collngo in a post
season charity game, Grinnell is the logical elcvcli
as far as the stoic is concerned.

“Since the start of football ill Iowa thcrc have
been four major tcanlsithe University of Iowa,
Iowa. State college, Drake uuivm ty and Grilluell
college. Bitter rivalry has cx’ cd between these
schools at various ll‘mCS. Until 192$). Iowa Statc‘
college appeared in homecoming here on alternate
years, and in five such homecoming contests llOl‘C,
Grinncll took two games and tied our, showing
that it is capable of providing competition for thc

FOR WORLD DISARMAMENT

\Vith lhc 1 world collfcl‘ollrc for thc I'cr

1932. the prowl“. year has tllkcll on an importance
which pl't ions cmll't‘l'cucr yours have not equalled.
The s conference assures the contin-
ucd pl'ug , .m'lumliollt. Its failure may ‘

situation.

The February conference will involve the dele-
gates of more than 50 nations. It is under the
leadership of the League of Notions. It has been
planned by the preparation comm on, which has
drawn up a draft convention, or proposed treaty.
Thc city of Geneva is ready to accommodate 6000
persons. Technical preparations seem to have been
accounted for.

The thing which tho. conference needs now
is public opinion in its favor, The United States
delegation will tithe the attitude which it believes
the Americans will support, Hugh Gibson, speak-
ing for the United States government, said, “It
has been repeatedly said that real achievement
by the conference can be reached only by all arous-
ed public opinion. This is profoundly true, but it
is not enough that public opinion bc aroused, It
is first of all necessary that it should be informed.

Grilluell collegr has thus far shown a surpris-
ing lack of interest in tile conference. Whether
or not those qualified to voice their opinions on
the subject are hopeful of definite results for this
particular conferencc, they are aware that nothing
can be done until the people are ready for it. A
series of chapel talks showing various sides of the
issues would be well received. Local publication
of articles on the subject might go fol:

Disarmament was (I live issue to tile Paris
peace conference. Has the world already forgotten
the horror of the world war? Grinnell college callr
not afford to ignore the February conference.

YEAR 10 AFTER MUSSOLINI

Lost Wednesday, Italy celebrated tllc bcgining
of the new year Xi. The fact is reminiscent of the
early centuries of the Christian era, when Romans
continued to date their documents A. U. 0., in
the year of the founding of the city.

But now something has taken place in Italy
which the Fosristi like to consider as significcant
as the founding .of Rome, the birth of Christ, the
first Olympic games, and the IIcgirll of Mohalnlncd.
For Mussolini has brought a new dispensation to
Rome. Nine years ago the Fascists cntcrcd the city,
and inaugurated it new Ql’a of empire.

'On \Vcdnesdoy Italian orators were awaken-
ing their countrymen to the thrill of being only 10
years from the beginning .of thin s, Corncrstollcs
were laid, which, offlcl may ilullginc, will be as
significant to future llllllcniums as tho Rctlllollelll
stable and the Roman forum arc to us.
