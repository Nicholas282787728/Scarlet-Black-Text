USE THE TALENTS OTHERWISE

Dr. Antonio Longoria, the physician who
claims to have discovered a “death ray,”
admits that, so far as he can see, the ray
would be of no use, except in case of wa .

This announcement makes us wonder
what the results would be if individuals of
talent would devote their time and energy
to more constructive things than discover-
ing horrible destroyers of the human race.
When men‘s thoughts are continually direct
ed to war and to means of destruction, the
only logical outcome is that some day there
will be another war, whose horror and ter—
ror can not even be imagined. So long as
the energies of capable men are directed
toward devices for war, so long as there is
profit to be made from the selling of these
devices, so long there will be imminent dan—
ger of another war.

If the driving power of our nations could
be concentrated on ways of preserving
peace, instead of upon ways of winning wars
our chances of prospering would be far more
reassuring! —A.L.B.
WHOSE FAULT IS IT?

”Cheater yourself!” are almost the
words Italy and Gelmany used to Russia
when the latter accused them of helping the
Spanish rebels. Meanwhile, a press report
states that the newest German, Italian, Rus~
sian, French, English and Dutcll planes,
flown by “neutrals,” many of them factory
pilots “testing” the ships, are spitting ma-
chine gun bullets and dropping bombs over
Spain. Equipment from Britain, France,
Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Belgium, Japan, and
the United States is being used in this war.

At the other end of Eurasia, China tells
Japan to remove her troops from North
China, let China deal with the situation,
abolish the Japan protected “autonomous
regime,” and stop Japanese smuggling. That
is part of the reply to the Japanese dc»
mands that China hire Japanese advisers in
all military and civilian branches of the
Chinese government, and grant autonomy to
five northern provinces of China.

What does it mean, are these idle
threats or do they mean general war imme-
diately? One hopeful sign is that with all
the sharp crises that have developed in this
last few years, we are not yet engaged in
general war. The nations are still firing
words and not bullets at each other. On
the other hand the nations ale all preparing
for war as fast as they can. A dictator
says with the great applause of his people,

THE GRDIN'ELL SCARLET AND BLACK

"Reject the absurdity of eternal peace, whichI

is foreign to our creed and to our tempera»
ment." Practically all the peoples of Asia
and Europe regard war as unavoidable and
have lost‘ hope in peace. Many still think
they can gain by war and try to precipitate
it.

As long as we see the hope of peace and
work for it, our chances of getting it are
infinitely greater than if we lose hope, be-
come desperate, and prepare for war. Such
preparations can lead to but one thing
catastrophe. ﬁRG.
HOW ABOUT IT, PROFESSORS"

Have you been disappointed ill Grinnell'!
Did you choose to come here because, as
lollg as you could remember, you had heard
that Grinllell was a “happy-family" sort of
place wholte evelyone spoke to everyone else
and a spirit Of general friendliness and cour
tesy prevailed and because it was the per
fect embodiment of the democratic spirit?
And now that you are here are you bewild-
ered because even the professors that you
like the best pass you in the corridors oi
the Alumni Recitation hall or on the street
with a vague expression, and never so mucll
as a Sign of recognition?

We have been hearing lately that Grin—
nell is changing—that its students are be-
coming snooty and cliquoeish, that no one
speaks to anyone else We have been won-
dering why. Doubtless it would be very
unfillr to lay all the blame at the doors of
the members of the faculty; but it does
seem that if a better example were set, the
student body would be more quick to follow
it.

For instance, there are housemothers in
the quadrangle who either do not recognize
women who have been in their cottage the
previous year or simply do not want to take
the trouble to speak to them.

Either failing is a grievous one. We
realize, 'and take into account, that it is
quite impossible for the harrassed faculty
to remember every pupil he or Sth‘ has had
in classes. But because professors should
help to maintain the traditions of G "nnell
ln everything—not merely chapel services~
we think they could act a little more cordial
to all students when they meet them; they
could offer to the students the courtesy that
students are expected to Show to profes-
sors; they could make studentsiespecially
the new ones—feel as though Grinnell is
really glad to have them, and not that they
are a supreme bother. Surely there is
nothing more dampening to the eagerness 01'
both old and new students alike than to be
passed without a Sign of recognition by the
professor in whose class they sit on the
front row. —A.L.B.

THE roort VOTER
(Student Life)

The 1936 presidential campaign certainly
should he remembered as one of the strangest in
American political history, voters who do not
favor the re—election of President Roosevelt appare
ently are in a quandary for a satisfactory candi—
date. Gov. Alf Landon has succeeded in winning
the support of ultra~oonservatives, the moneyed
interests, old Guard Republicans, and Hearst. He
has not been so successful with the ordinary voter
who dislikes both Roosevelt and Old Guardism.
Resultiit is not unusual to hear people remark
that they do not intend to vote on election day.

This attitude is clearly demonstrated by the
utterances of two large newspapers in announcing
their opposition to the President. The Baltimore
Sun recently stated that it docs not favor the rc-
election of President Roosevelt, But the Sun did
not urge the election of Landon. It remained
mute on the subject of supporting a candidate.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, also opposing Roose-
velt for reelection, stated rather lialf-hcartcdly
that the only logical thing to do, if one agrees with
its stand, is to vote for Landon. The Republican
candidate, it seems, is supported with apologies
rather than with enthusiasm.

In short, if a voter believes Roosevelt
carrying the nation toward fascism and socialism,
and at the same time feels that Landon stands
for Hooverism and Old Guard Republicanism, he
has no candidate for whom to vote. All the minor
candidates, Lernkc, Thomas, Browder, and the
rest, are more radical than Roosevelt. Conser
quently, many voters are planning to sit at home
on election clay and hope for the best, no matter
who wins.

Comments
of the Readers

To the editor of the Scarlet and
Black
Dear sir:

There appeared in the last issue
of the Scarlet and Black several
letters by students on the need
of another choral organization, l
sympathize with the point of View
taken by these writers, There
should be an opportunity for stu»
dents who love to sing to receive
training in the alt of choral sings
mg. Those students not membe
of the Glee clubs and the Vesper
choir can only be served by an
organization planned specifically
for their needs.

Since my name has been men-
tioned as a possible director I feel
that 1 have license to oflei o. few
suggestions about such a chonls
which you are free to accept or
reject as you will. The purpose
of this student chorus ought to
be twofold: to provide training in
lhe singing of representativc
choruses isacred and secular, a
cappella and with accompani»
meat); to otfer pleasant and
stimulating recreation and a
chance for individual and group
self-expression through song.

Public performance should be
an objective, No chorus ever
finds its scarlegs if it is always
in rehearsal and never in pel'fOI-
mance. Therefore, when three or
four numbers are mastered suf-
ficiently to present, they should
be presented. That one public
performance is worth three i-e-
hearsals is no mere capricious
statement. The student singers
should have the exhilaration and
spur of repeated public hearings.
In this way they can convince
themselves and their fellow: stu-
dents that they are alive and
going places, occasional bad tones
notwithstanding.

Such a. student chorus should
have a democratic beginning it
should spring from popular stu-
dent demand. All students who
love to sing, who wish to learn
something about singing or who
want the thrill of blending a
diminuitive, self-conscious tone
With the fullrthroated diapason of
some future “Doll Giovanni" should
band together and propagate the
idea. Who knows what talent
might be discovered were you all
to do this. They say that Caruso
was an insignificant member of
a chorus for some time until
some one thought his nasal tenor
had possibilities and boosted him
on his way to stardom. It is not
impossible that a second Law-
rence Tibbott or Lily Pans might
be discovered among you!

1 wish to accompany these sllg’»
gestions with a hearty endars‘cr
ment of the idea. You have my
promise of cooperation and assis
tance.

F. waltcr Huffman.

To The Editor:

Last week Miss Sherman and
Miss Wheeler expressed the desire
of a number of students to oz»
ganize a mixcd chorus. I, too.
am of the opinion that such a
group should be organized, and
believe that there are enough
good voices on the campus to
form this chair. There are many
students with good voices who
were unable to get into the glee
clubs. it may have been because
of lack of training, or it may
have been because there were not
enough places for them. At any
rate those who wish to continue

singing have few ohanccs to do
so. An a capclla clion- would pro—
vide an opportunity to do some
choral work,

The music department is ready
and willing to organize such a
choir. Under their direction a
really constructive program could
be worked out.

An a capella chair would nceu‘
to practice for perhaps an hour
and a half a week. That much
time spent in serious practice
would be very helpful, Several
students who have never tiied
out for glee club have said that
they would like to be in a group
which didn’t take so much time.
If we, the students, are willing
to work a little while cacli week,
then an a capella choir wou‘i
certainly be a worthwhile orga
zation.

College President
Urges Sportsmanship
in Political Campaigns

New York City (ACTH—Dr. Wil-
liam Mather Lewis, president of
LaFayette college, thinks that
sportsmanship should be substitut-
ed for the present “mud»slinging"
of political campaigns.

Addressing the closing- session
at the nineteenth annual conven-
tion of the New York state Dis-
trict cf Kiwanis Intemational, Dr.
Lewis said:

“The mud-slinging, personal at-
tacks, and Vitupei-ation now hcing
promoted by certain political
campaign leaders is a disgrace,
and their under-handed and mo-
i-onic propaganda is an insult to
the intelligence of the American
public. Until we put political con-
tests on higher planes, we will find
it difficult to persuade men of the
finest type to become candidates
for office."
