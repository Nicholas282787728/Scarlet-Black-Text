Presidents, deans and other high
officials o[ 20 eastern colleges are
members of the advisory hoard wlii'th i
has worked out the plans for the con- ,

fcrencc.

This series will enable college men

field to enter, to obtain clearer, more
definite conceptions of the leading’
industries and professions and to sec'
and hear business and professional
leaders at a time when it is most ims

college season.

Aid to Students

A further aim is to eliminate the
floundering- ot the student starting
out in business. University officials
believe that if the business brains of
the country can hold open forum with
those seeking a career, many years
of man power wasted in a misfit field
can he eliminated, and the paths to
success-Will be arrived upon more
speedily. This first conference is
frankly an experiment. It is hoped
‘tllat it will stimulate young men and
‘womcn to think beyond merely get-
ti ing a job, and to consider the career
possibilities ﬁve or ten years hence in
‘tlie fields they are entering. If siic-
cessfiil, the conference may become

 

an annual event.
