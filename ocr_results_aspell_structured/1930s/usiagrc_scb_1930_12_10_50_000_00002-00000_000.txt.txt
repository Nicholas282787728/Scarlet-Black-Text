LANTERN GETS THE TELEPHONE

It seems to be customary at. Grinncll college
this year for any one of various campus organiza-
tions to attempt to be the ﬁrst to take the credit
for the success of a project which has been the
goal ol‘several groups. Already such a mad scram-
ble of “taking credit” for the installation of the
telephone ill the corridor between the college 1i-

' and the Alumni Recitation hall yesterday af-
ternoon has resulted. '

The Scarlet and Blacl: has editorially advo-
cated a telephone in the corridor for several years.
Last year, under the 1929-30 management. this
issue was often discussed. “Since there is already
a telephone system in the Alumni Recitation hall,
it should not be very difﬁcult to tap the present

lilies and make two extensions running to phones
placed ill strategic positions ill the recitation hall.”
reads an editorial in The Scarlet and Black of Nov.
30,1929.

“The installation of telephones, or the setting
aside of one of the offices as a public booth, should
not be a very difﬁcult matter, and the advantages
resulting from such an improvement would easily
compensate for ally trouble involved,” the editorial
concludes,

The Scarlet and Black under the present mane
agelnent has not editorially campaigned for the
corridor telephone. The only organization which
has conducted an investigation on the situation this
fall, and which also had the idea as one of the
group’s projects last year, is the Lantern society.

A committee was appointed by Lantern early
in the fall to confer with L: V Phelps, college
treasurer, and Jesse L. Fellows, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, ill regard to the installation
of a telephone this year. The members met with
cordial receptions, and were assured of cooperation.

The installation of the telephone in the library
yesterday was the answer to an editorial request
a year old, and the suggestion of Lantern this ﬁllll.
To Lantern goes the credit for again carrying on
the “crusade,” and to the college authorities goes
the gratitude of the student and faculty bodies,
particularly the thanks of Lantern.

M'ILITARISTS LOSING GROUND

Abrogation of the right to uss a certain
subject nearly always, if not alwa) s, indicates that
there is a deﬁnite weakness on the side of the one
who holds tllc power of granting or withholding
the speaking privilege.

There was a weakness ill George Ill’s refusal
to listen to the requests of the American colonists.
He lost, a llation. There was a weakness ill the
tactics of Nicholas II of Russi He lost his head.

It is extremely unlikely that any major cvil
will occur because of the refusal of the secretary
of the Memorial Union at Iowa State college to
allow opponents of compulsory military training to
meet in the union. .But the lnilitarists have been
losing glound. If they want to regain it, they
would best meet the anti-training group in its own
te it y. If their proposals are too weak to stand
disc slou, they should be eliminated.

For a good many years the niilitarists have
held the whip hand ill Iowa. The law has been on
their side, and they have taken full advantage of
it. Now that public resentment is being aroused
they assume a. pose of digniﬁed superiority, and
refuse to discuss or allow to be discussed.

Will those worthy gentlemen, who, according to
their own statements, have always exemplified the
finest qualities of American manhood, take a tip
from thousands of American high school boys and I
college men, and exhibit even a small amount ofl
true-blue sportsnlallshipY—D. Me.

DEFINITE HOURS FOR WOMEN

Women come to college to acquire an ecll‘tt‘ﬂr
tion. Despite what has been said to the contrary.
they do come, pl'ilnarily_ to study. They are tlle
ones then wllu should see to it that they study.
They are pa ‘ng for their education, and it is
their business whether or not they get it.

But the college sets definite hours for women
to he in so that they may get their studying done.
The men have no set hours, but they manage to
study. Are the will powers of women so much
weaker than men’s? Do they need to lie forcibly
kept ill before they will study:7 And is there any
deﬁnite reason to believe that, when they do get
in early. they will study‘,I

It may be that women are required to he in
at a certain time, because it is thought that they
may get illto trouble. But, as “whozis” say “The
modern woman can take care of herself if she
wants to. hilt if she doesn't want to, no one can
make her do it.”

It is hardly flattering to the women to even
think that they have not the back bone to study,
or the common sense to take care of themselves.

Intel-at in Grinnen Game

Captain Sdlloening. Earl Loose,
and Brad Robinson turned in nice
games and showed up rather well
Monday night. against the second
stringers. Schoenihg, who has been
slow in rounding into form, apparent-
ly found himself under the fire of
competition and played a fine game.
Loose also looked good. and Brad
Robinson, playing his first varsity
game Saturday, looked like a corner,

Considerable interest is heing
shown in the coming contest with
Grinhell, as the Iowans are always
strong, and with a veternn aggrega—
tion this season, they are expected to
make things mighty interesting for
Coach MacMillsn and his boys.

10 Grinnell Men
WiII Make Trip

Coach John c. Trucsdale of the Grin-
nell cagers announced this afternoon
that. he would take 10 men to Minn-
eapolis to tangle with the University
of Minnesota. quintet Saturday. The
squad will lesve Grinnell Friday
night.

Since the affair will be chiefly a.
practice contest for both aggrega—
tions, the Pioneer mentor will probr
chly use all of the men making the
trip at various stages of the game.

Only Two Veternns

Douglas and McCreary are the on-
ly two men who were on last year's
team. Scott and Wolfe were on the
squad lost season, but did not see
much action. Duncan was on the
freshman team a year ago, where he

did some good Work at the pivot pus-
ition.

Ruff. captain, and Humphrey ‘are
still out with injuries collected during
the latter part of the foothnll season.
Ullrich, the flashy guard on last.
year's fros‘a team, who was doped to
fill a place on this season’s varsity,
will probably be out until late in the
season, as he was operated on for ap-
pendicitis only two weeks ago.

With these men out, the Pioneers
will race is real test Saturday night,
because the Minnesota team has a
number of veterans who are tall, fast,
and hsve a mean eye for the basket.

The Christmss holidays will begin
Friday, Dec. 19, and classes will again
be resumed Monday, Jan. 5. The addi-
tional Monday after New Year's is
omitted because of the extra day
hliowecl at Thanksgiving.
