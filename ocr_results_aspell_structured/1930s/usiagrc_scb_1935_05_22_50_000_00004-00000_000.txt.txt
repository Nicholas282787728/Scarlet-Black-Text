Gates, Rawson
Play 9-9 Game

Kelly Men Lose to Smith
Monday Afternoon

Smith wallcped Rawson 10-3 Mon.
day and the Kelly men turned around
and played Gates to a 9—9 tie Tuesday
in the two baseball games played in
intramural competition this week.

The game yesterday afternoon was
a heartbreakor for the Rawson play—
ers. They led all the way and went
into the last inning with a 9.8 margin.
Graves. Rawson hurler, borc down and
reﬁred two men. As six o’clock ap—
proached Bower singled, stole second,
and scored on Fini’s single. The
game was tied up and Graves walked
Badger just before the game was call»
ed.

Decision Reversed

The first decision of the umpires
was that Rawson had won as they
ruled that the score would revert to
,the last full inning played .The
score at the end of the fourth was
9.3. In conference last night the de.
cision was reversed and the game
declared a tie, and will be replayed
at some future date.

In Monday’s game Smith won in
first ball game of the year from the
same luckless men of Kelly, 10.3.
Schlotlerbeck, Smith hurler, pitched
fine ball and except for sloppy work
by his mates might have had a shut—
out. Rawscn threatened in only the
third inning, when they put their
two his together with a walk and
two errors but scored only one run
Smith scored in every' inning with
Hunn's wildness putting the base
runners on the paths for the most
part. accompanied by loose fielding
behind him.

Healthy Mindedness Needed
in Religion, Owen Declares

“We will have very little religion
in human affairs unless we have
healthy mindedness," asserted the Rev.
L. A. Owen of the Congregational
church of Iowa City in his Vespers
address on the topic “The Living God
in Human Affairs." .

Mr. Owen believes that the youth
of today who dances and plays is as
religious as the pale, weak individual
who represented the religious faith
in the past years. There has been a
great deal of emphasis on personal
health in the past few years; then pooT
ple became interested in taking Du!
intelligence quotient, Now, we are
holding the theory of emotional tests.
All these are good, he said, for in them
we are trying to create a whole per»

body, and emotional outlook.

Push Health Program

“During the last few years, in pushr
ing the public health program," con—
tinued Reverend Owen, “many men
have looked at it from this point of
view. ‘The poor are coming (Torn
homes infested with hundreds of germs
into our public schools. We must
look after our children’s health.’ these
business men have, as a result, made
some improvements, but: there are
still many families lrving in huts and
novels."

should Encourage Soul

“Unless we can build an environ-
ment that encourages the soul of a
man to come out," he said, “I can’t
see how we can live a Christian life.
If we want our religion to be cf.
fective in human affairs, we must
build our society so men and women
may have a chance in the world, so
little children may not be stunted in
growth."

"We need emergency stations, hos—
pitals for the sick, homes for the old
people," he continued. "If the churchs
could spend as much time in curing
the causes of needs for these institu—
tions, as they do in building them,
our religion would be lots more ef.
fective."

Beatrice Mills of Des Moines spent
lhe weekend with her sister, Marian
Mills ’38.
