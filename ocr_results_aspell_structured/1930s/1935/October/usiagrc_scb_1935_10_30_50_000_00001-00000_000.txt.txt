Dr. Herring
Talks Today

Presents Clear
of Mexico

Picture

A brief but clear picture of the
Mexican situation was given by Dr.
Hubert Herring, authority on Pan-
American relations. at a convoca-
tion chapel this morning. He men-
tioned eight words: Indian, Span—
ish, revolution, land, church,
schools, pride and beauty. as being
descriptive of the Mexican civiliza-
tion.

"Mexico covers a great deal of
territory and time," began Dr.
Herring. “It is an Indian land with
a very thin coating of modern civie
ilization, In fact," he pointed out,
“of the 17 million inhabitants in
Mexico, about 14 million are al-
most purerblooded Indians."

A Spanish Land

Mexico is also a Spanish land,
said Dr. Herring. Its numerous
church towns tell the tale of Spam
ish conquests under Cortes, and
only about two million people do
not speak Spanish.

“The most real word in Mexico
today, however, is revolution,"
stated Dr. Herring. The revolution-
ary forces were underway as early
as 1310 and are continuing into
the present time in the form of (107
mestic strife.

The speaker continued, saying
that the only kind of liberty the
Indian can enjoy is to own land.

Church Important

Another important word in this
Mexican picture is the Church For
over a hundred years there has exe
isted in Mexico a clash between
the church and the state. It has de-
veloped because “organized religion
becomes the handmaid of kings,"
and the tendency of the church-
men and land owners has been to
work together. Cooperation be-
tween church and state is pro—
gressing now, he added.

Dr. Herring explained that the

tle difficulty in subduing the Has-
kell Indians by a score of 19-0.

passing attack, and will undoubt-
edly take to the air in an effort to
score against hte heavier Drake
