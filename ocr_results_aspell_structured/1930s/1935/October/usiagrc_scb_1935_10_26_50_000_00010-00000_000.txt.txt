Idea Lapses

After this. the idea seems to
have lapsed as no further mention
of Homecoming can be found un-
til 1919, when the Scarlet and
Black. as the Pioneers were called
then, again played Cornell and
emerged with a 7-7 tie. other fes-

drama.

In 1921 Homecoming was held
on Armistice day, and a double
celebration was held. The Pioneers
defected Cornell. 13.0, in a game
played on a field covPred with

Celebration Expanded

have been the first one, for which
an elaborate program was planned.

The most elaborate Homecoming
ever held was in 1929, when
the college and the commu»
nity cooperated ina four day
diamond jubilee celebration, in
honor of 75 years of community
existence. Among the visitors at
this event was Gary Cooper, a
former Grinnell student.

The last Homecoming battle won

during the course of the game,
seven of them being completed,
four for touchdowns, and Wash—
