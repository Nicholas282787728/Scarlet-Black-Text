Supension of Cyclone Not New;
Classes Worked on Other Projects

Reporter’s Investigation

Shows Evolution

of Annual 1

Contrary to popular belief, the
recent suspension of publication of
the Cyclone is not the first time
that no annual has been published,
but it is the first time that the
faculty has ordered the suspcne
sion. The classes of 1896. 1393,
1900 and 1904 did not publish an»
nuals, electing instead to develop
some other project.

An investigation of the files of
the Scarlet and Black and the old
Cyclones reveals that the tempor-
arily defunct publication has led
a varied life and since its found-
ing in 1889 has changed consider-
ably .

First Cyclone in 1889

The first Cyclone ivas published
in May, 1889, by the class of 1890.
with A. W. Merrill and c. S.
Crookshank as editorsdmchief.
Their stated purpose was: “We
have not tried to be wise or funny
or even original, but simply to‘
present a picture of college life
from a student's standpoint."

They named it for the cyclonel

which seven years before had,
swept away'all the college build—l
ings, and said. “We call it the Cyr
clone because its sway covers all:
human life and sweeps over a vast
territory.”

The early Cyclones were a coin-
bination of the present annual,
Malteascr and Tanager, They con-

Itained, besides engravings of the

faculty members, many pen and
ink sketches of campus life, hu-
morous poetry, plays and short
stories.

The classes of 1391 and 1392,
when the college color was pink.
issued similar annuals. The next
year, photographs of tho athletic
teams were included. “Hornets"
became the name of the annual
in 1395, otherwise the publication
remained the same.

Ploy instead of Annual

“The Merchant of Venice“ was
presented by the class of lee in
place of an annual, and ’97 wrote.
published and prescnted an origi—
>nal play, “The Professor's Discov-
el'y.” A small book of short
stories, “On a Western Campus,"
took the place of the annual for
1898.

The semicentennial issue was
,“The Blue Book," printed entirely
in blue and illustrated with blue—
prints. The next year, 1900. did
away with an annual entirely. glv-
ling instead a play, “The Return
of Odysseus.” “The Imp" was the
annual in 1901.

Revived After Seven Years

After a seven year rest. the Cy-
clone was revived in 1902 in its
a scarlet and
black cover. The next year it dis
appeared in favor of a similar an-
nual titled “The Scarlet and

.Black“.

The class of 1904 gave, instead

-of an annual, a hanquet and a

lplay, “Wanted,
From 1905, when it again ap-
peared, the Cyclone retained its
title and general appearance and
character until this year. It grad

Cornelia Otis Skinner, famous

eight-part program consisting of
her original character sketches in

the auspices of the Griniiell lecture

Although Miss Skinner appears

chair or twoishe is within herself

“will offer far more entertainment
than can be found in most play-
liouses on Broadn ay."

She is both star and company,
stage crew and costume mistress,
to say nothing of being playwright
