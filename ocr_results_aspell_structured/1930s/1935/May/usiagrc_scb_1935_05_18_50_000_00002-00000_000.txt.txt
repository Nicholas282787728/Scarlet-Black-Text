STUDENT COUNCIL FARCE

Once again the annual problem of student
government on this campus has arisen. The in-
augural address of the new president of the Stu-
dent Council showed laudable intentions, although
they will be hard to achieve.

One phrase in the address was particularly
striking If the council can not go forward, then
I will do my utmost to see that the entire project
is dropped was the gist of the declaration by the
new president.

This attitude more than any other part of the
ceremony of installation really represented the
truest cross-section of student opinion on the
question of student government. The time cer-
tainly has come for some sort of definite, con—
crete action in regard to this habitual bone of
contention Either the students should be given
real control of their own affairs or the entire
matter should be dropped. As things now stand,
the farce of student government is becoming more
and more ludicrous each yearl

The students realize that many of the student
bodies have no power, and especially is this true
of the Student Council. How futile are the
achievements of the Student Council is shown
by the record of the retiring council. Granted
that some of the achievemenmwnamely the allot-
ment of the semester fee—were really worthwhile,
still, it does seem a trifle far fetched to go to all
the bother of electing a Student Council to delibr
crate on such weighty matters as election of a
pep queen or the inauguration of non-date, cut-
dances. Either of these matters probably could
have been handled much more efficiently by a
joint committee selected from the members of the
Women’s Self~Government league board and the
Council of House Presidents.

That is the past record of the Student Coun-
cil. What can be expected in the future under
the present arrangement? Practically nothing.
The new president outlined his proposals for the
new council. Includued were a plan for reforma-
tion of the auditing of students accounts and mak-
ing the varsity dances more social. Worthy
projects, but seemingly trivial matters to bother
to elect a president and half a dozen other of-
ficials to take care of.

The crux of the whole matter that there is
really nothing for the Student Council to do that
warrants the retention of the body under the pres-
ent system. The problems pertaining specifically
to either the men or women are taken care of by
either the men’s or women’s governing body,
while the Student Council debates more weighty
matters. Joint action is rare, and could be taken
care of probably by the joint committee.

Also this Situation can not be remedied under
the present set-up. Article two of the Student
Council constitution says “the Student Council
shall be a co-ordinating agency. Its purpose
shall be to secure the highest degree of coopera-
tion ambng the various campus organizations and
with the faculty for the best interests of all, and
to carry out‘its own special functions as set forth
in the by»laws"—-which means what? Plainly
there is little hope of progress under such a con-
stitution.

As the conditions now exist, there is no use
in continuing the Student Council, and if it is
ever to become a really inﬂuential part of the
so-called Student Government, a radical revision
will be necessary. Unless the radical revision is
achieved—and a really radical one at thatiit
is utterly futile to continue the farce of the
Student Council as an institution cfstudentgov.

FAIR CRITICISM

Disregarding the Senate’s compromise plan
for a 10 month extension of the code rule for

industry, a new agreement has been drawn up
between the President and the NRA governing
board to fight for a two year extension of the
recovery law. In spite of wellvfounded and in—
telligent criticism from both political and indus—

‘trial leaders, and the complete breakdown of a

number of the code provisions, the administration
is evidently willing to wager everything and fight
to the finish for its present extension plan.

Mr. Roosevelt's attitude toward criticism of
the NRA has been one of distinct hostility. He
has not hesitated on a number of occasions to
rebuke this cri 'cism as coming from selfish and
partisan sources. Although this attitude may
have been fair enough during the early days of
his administration when it was yet too early to
judge of the success or the failure of the NRA,
it is distinctly out of place today. With the ap-
parent breakdown of the functioning and adminis-
tration of a large part of the NRA, reasonable
criticism certainly has its place.

Recently ex-president Hoover made a state—
ment, by far the best he has made on any sub-
ject since 1932, on the NRA, in which he re—
viewed it in a thorough and intelligent way, agree-
ing that while the ends are desirable, the means
used by the Roosevelt administration are wrong.
He followed each criticism up with alternatives
which in the light of our experience, seem to be
sound.

The United States Chamber of Commerce
with delegates representing nearly 600,000 in.
dividual business firms and trade associations,
voted overwhelmingly against extending the NRA
beyond its present time limit. This cannot be
interpreted to be merely the voice of big business,
because 48.5 per cent of the voting strength in
the Chamber of Commerce lies in cities with a
population under 100,000.

The Brookings Institute of Washington D. C.,
a non-partisan organization, has just published
a most unprejudiced and exhaustive research en-
titled ”The National Recovery Administration,
an Analysis and Appraisal" which backs up much
of the criticism of the above-mentioned sources.
The view of this report is that the NRA has on
the whole retarded rather than Stimulated re-
covery.

These three examples have been cited be-
cause they show that criticism of the NRA is no
longer mere political strategy, but is based upon
sound and comprehensive investigation of its
workings and results. They also reveal criti-
cism from three different sources—politics, busi-
ness and industry, and economics' Mr. Rooses
velt should take heed of this criticism instead of
blindly pushing his extenseion plan through Con-
gress at the same time accusing his critics of be-
ing selfish and unsympathetic toward national
recovery. There is very evidently some justi-
ﬁcation for the opposition. It is for the best
interests of the country that he should give all
criticism a fair consideration. ' —R. W.

NAVY MANEUVERS?
(Iowa State Students)

Two lives and several thousand dollars is the cost
to date of the United States navy’s playing around this
spring in the western Pacific, but this expenditure may
easily be‘ insignificant in comparison lidyhat the dam:
age to our relations with Japan may cost.

it isn't that we do not have a perfect right to con-
duct mysten'ous ship and plane maneuvels near our
own possessions. We undoubtedly do. But the ques.
tion as to whether it is diplomatic is an entirely different
one.

In this connection Will Rogers quip hinting that
Japan will probably arrange for navy practice off Cata-
lina Island some summer is directly to the_point.

The attitude of the American people towards any
mysterious Japanese “black fleet" maneuvering on this
side of the Pacific is not difficult to imagine, Yet we are
doing just that thing in relation to them and creating
just such suspicion and fear this spring in those who
are nearer to Midway Island than are we.

So often has trouble with Japan been suggested that
our relations with that country are Srained enough; we
need hardly go out of our way—ethaf ls, go more than
half the distance across the Pacific—to put them more on
edge. The cause of peace has never been advanced by
such demonstrations.

The Student has no illusions that its opinion is go-
ing to have any effect on the present maneuvers; we do
not share the attitude of lhat delegate to the Iowa Stu~
dents’ Legislative Assembly here recently who, just be.
fore the adoption of a resolution condemning this navfll
demonstration, replied to an attack with the exclama-
tion, “What! You aren't going to let Roosevelt go ahead
and send the navy out there, are you?”

But some day we students who are coming of age
will have more effective voices. Let us hope that then
it will be our purpose to prevent this use of matches
around the gasoline tank of touchy national self—interest.

Rules are rules at Ohio State uni-
varsity.

There was a big blaze in the wo.
men's dormitory there, and firemen
found the charred end of a cigaret at
the spot where the fire began. But
the University rules say there can be
no smoking in the dormitory. A nice
problem.

So the official report attributes the
fire to a “cigaret which blew into

Every campus selects one or more

She is the “Needle Queen,” and in~
stead of parading about with only a
bathing suit on, the stipulations are
that she must wear a complete dress—«
a homemade dress at that! The best

Memories of examinations while a
student in the private gymnasium,
where he studied as a boy, were relat-
ed by George 0. Seiv‘er, assistant pra-
fessor of French, in his chapel talk
Thursday.

Examinations were of two sore, he
explained, either written or oral. By
far the most difficult were the oral
tests to which the paronu and school
directors came to listen. Constant ad-
munitions for thorough work created
an atmosphere of tenseness among
the 12 and 13 year old boys, Mr. Seiver
stated.

After examinations were over. scv.
eral days passed before marks were
posted publicly. Studene who had
achieved outstanding success were
honored. with prizes presented cere-
moniously by the school director.
Contmsting these examinations with
ours, Mr. Seiver said, “There are no
oral examinations here, no parents,
no directors. You come in and sit
down, write the examination. and go
awry-"
