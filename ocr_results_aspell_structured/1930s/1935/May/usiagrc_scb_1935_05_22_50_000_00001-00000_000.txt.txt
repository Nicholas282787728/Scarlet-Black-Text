Grinnell Given Chance
to Win Meet Saturday

Both Grinnell and Iowa State have
an even chance of winning the tri—
angular meet which will be staged at
Ames Saturday. Coe, the third com—
petitor, will not have much of a chance
Lester Duke, track coach, thinks, in
spite of the Kohawks recent victory in
the Mid-West conference meet.

Pre.meet forecasts reveal that on
paper the lowa State aggregation is
seven points better than the pioneers
due to the Cyclone‘s superior strength
in the ﬁeld events. ‘Grinnell will
probably cxcell in the running eyents,
especially in the 440 and the mile rc-
lay races, although the Pioneers will
face fast competition in all events.

Grinnell might win the meet if Cue
upsets lowa State, or the Pioneer field
men crash through with unexpected
points, Upon these factors depends
Grinnell’s chances of annexing first
plake, Duke declared yesterday.

Lecturer Speaks
of Vast Changes
in Balkan States

in sketching the political, economic
and racial problems of the various
nations of the Near East, Dr. George
E. White. '32, president of Anatolia

the vast changes that have takcn
place in the status of the various races.
in speaking Monday night innerrick
chapel on “Problems of the Balkans,”
he gave a comprehensive survey of
exciting conditions.

Among the Turkish people, espcc.
ially can these changes bc noticed, Dr,
White explained. No longer is it the
custom for one man to have three
or four wives, now instead a man has
but one wife. Such a change is the
result of social progress, he believes.

In the balkans since the World War,
many problems have arisen during
the reconstruction. Loss of popu»
laticn, for example, has caused labor
problems, he pointed out. in Turkey,
there has been decline in population
from between 40 to 50 million to 10
million. This large and sudden Shrink—
age has naturally resulted in grave
problems.

The problem ot religion is espec-
ially grave, Mr. White said, due to
the mixture of races—Greeks, Armena
ians and Moselms, all jumbled together-
——each of whom has their own special
ideas, and who show little toleration
for the other races.
