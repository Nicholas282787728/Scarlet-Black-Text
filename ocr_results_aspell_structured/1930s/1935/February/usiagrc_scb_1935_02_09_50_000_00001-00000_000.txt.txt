Grinnell representatives at Mason City
lost a heartebreakcr in all overtime
period, 34—33, The second outfit took
a 2111 drubbing.

The tilt at Mason City was by far
the more interesting, with the Grinnell
five gaining the lead after a late start
only to lose on a free throw in the
extra stanza.

Grinncll Starts Slowly

The junior collegians gained an
early advantage and held a 14.2 mar.
gin at the end of the first quarter.
However, the disorganization which
slowed up Grinnell’s play in this
period disappeared in the next quar.
ter- and the preps narrowed their op.
ponenls' lead to six points, 20.14.

The frosh continued their spurt at
the start of the second half and by the
end of the third period had wiped out
the Mason City advantage to knot the
count at 25 all. At the start of the
final quarter Grinnell jumped into the
lead for he first time, and toward the
end of therperiod the trash boasted a
33—29 lead.

it would be difficult to imagrnc
Beethoven playing more superlatively
great than that which Mr. Schnabel
gave; nor Schubert playing. Some,
perhaps, would prefer their Mozart
a little less iull.bodied, but that is a
matter of opinion.

Throughout, Mr. Schnabel’s per.
fonnance was characterized by inspir.

sacrificed to mere vitruosity.
