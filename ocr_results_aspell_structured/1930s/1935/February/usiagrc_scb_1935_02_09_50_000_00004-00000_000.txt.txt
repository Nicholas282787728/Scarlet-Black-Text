Mrs. Robert Kerr Reviews
Two Books at Tea Friday

Reviews of two recent books were
given yesterday afternoon in the quad.
rangle drawing room by Mrs. Robert
‘1. Kerr in the third of a series of teas
sponsored by thesquadrangle social
committee and the Cap and Gown
society.

"Personal History” by Vincent Shae.
an, 34 year old newspaper man, is
not another ego on parade, Mrs. Kerr
said. ,"W'hatever it lacks in perspec—
tive it makes up in vigor and fresh.
of viewpoint," She declared The
book is an account of Sheehan’s ex.
pcriences as an undergraduate at the
University of Chicago and his travel as
foreign correspondent for syndicate
American newspapers.

He covered the League of Nations
for a time, spent several months dis.
guised as an Arab during the Riffian
wars, and visited Persia, Spain, and
Russia. Some oi his accounts of the
chineseievolution have been printed
recentlyin “The Atlantic Monthly."

Mrs. Kerr quoted sheean as saying
at the close of‘his book, ‘Those who
are young now are going to see more,
not less, of revolution.“

“Heaven’s My Destination," Thorn.
ton Wilder's latest book, was also re.
viewed. it is the story of George
Brush, a text.book salesman. Mrs. Kerr
said, who in living a Christian life
makes a host of enemies. The key.
note of the book is given on the title
page as, “Of all the forms of genius.
goodness has the longest awkward
age." Brush innocently causes a rur
on a bank and is driven out oi 231m.

ball fortunes and Cowboy followers are
satisfied that only the pitiful lack of
material has kept the young blondc
mentor from winning a conference
title in the first year of his regime.
Long an urplan sport at A. and M,
the cage has found new life under the
direction of the “miracle man” of the
middle west. Aggie fans took a new
interest in the sport this winter when
the college athletic department induced
the former Oklahoman to continue the
meteoric career he had Started at
Marysvill: Teachers and Colorado in
his home state.
Tough Brcaks Numerous

And figures will show that only
few tough breaks have kept lba fror'
threatening the conference leaders in.
the title race. To date the Cowboys
have won only two of their seven Con.

of five non.conference battles. But 0'

three were overtime battles in wliic‘
the Aggies lost early leads, and Si"
of the seven defeats were by one or
two point margins.

Although lba has not bemoaned the
lack of material. local fans are con.
vinced that one good forward would
have eliminated the narrow losses of
the season. Of the Cowboy forwards
only three have seen previous action
in their positions, it is a lineup of
four guards and a center that takes
the floor for the Aggies and their de.

Another deficiency is the lack of
altitude in the starting lineup. Only
four members of the squad can brush
the six.ioot mark and the Aggies hovc
had to spot the opposition the center

But the Aggies continue to be no

continued the reputation in Stillwater

Spartan Cager Uses
Old Caster as Charm

_EAST LANSING, Mich.~(ACP)——

Rabbiu’ feet may be the pot luck
pieces of most lootball players, but
Eddie Rolen, sophomore basketball

forward of the Michigan State college
five, trusts his fate to a bed castcr.

Rolen Carried a bed caster through.
out high school as a good luck omen,
and he still retained it when he be.
came a member of the Spartan squad.
When he enters a game he always
hands the caster to Edward Kemp, stu.
dent manager, for safekeeping. Very
few are allowed to handle it because
of fear the special charm it is supposed
to hold will escape.
