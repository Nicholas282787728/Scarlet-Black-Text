By PAT GALLAGHER.

Concerning Grinnell's unaccustomed
position at the head of the Missouri
Valley standings the editor of The
Croightonian said recently, “This is
the first time the Pioneers have mpp.
ed the Valley league in such a late
stage. Most of the Valley fans placed
their money on Creighton, out this
year, especially after losing to Okla.
homa Aggies and Drake, they have
changed their minds. This may be a
wise move but in my estimation
Creighton will be in the lead when
the season buttons up." Well, we can
all tell more about that after Saturday
night,

The 1935 Pioneer eagcrs have
already stamped themselves as re.
cord breakers, conic what may the
rcst ol the season. Last year.
when the team won eight con.
tests and lost seven, was the first
since 1911.13 that a Grinnell team
had earned better than a .5tttt sea.
son record. ..This year's outlit has
won 10 tilts to datc and have
four remaining on the schedule.
The question before the house now
is, are they jinx brcakcrs as well
as record breakers. .ror it’s five
Creighton men plus an established
jinx which they must face at oina.
ha when they meet Creighton Sat.
urttay.

This year the team has one very
zeal advantage over their Nebraska
adversaries. If an iota of importance
can be attached to comparative scores,
the Pioneers have a better team this

northenders remain undefeated, while
Clark and Langau each have but one

For (his reason, a large collection at
liverworts and mosses has been ac.
cumulatcd al Grinnell in recent years,
which includes Specimens from all

professor of botany. reports that at
present lhe Grinnell herbarium col.
lection includes 787 species and var.
ieties and 5,150 specimens of mosses,
and 135 species and varieties and 750
specimens oi liverworts.
Ncw Specimens Received

This present high total was recently
attained when the bot-my department
received 54 named specimens
cl mosses and 33 liverworts from Ber.
lin, Germany, and 26 liverworts from
Novia Scotia by exchange with other
mass colleclors.

Besides the specimens identified and

Geneva Sayre, ’33. who acted as
graduate assistant in botany here last
year, identified all of the Grinnell
specimens from the western third of
Iowa and prepared a report on her
research before the Iowa Academy or
Science, She is at present continuing
her work along this line at the Uni.
versity of Wyoming.

When asked recently, “why all this
moss gathering?" Professor Conard as.
serted that it was mainly a hobby, the
same as stamp or autograph collecting.
But it has a practical value, also, he
asserted, a the mosses indicate the

the districts from which they are ob.

The co.ed with the most delicious
sense oi humor in all America, we
think, is a girl, whose real name is
unknown, at the University of Iowa.

A student Methodist convention was
in progress on that campus the other
day and dates were provided lor some
of the out.ol.state boys. One of these
young men was presented with a largc
buxom girl for the evening. Somehow
he caught the phrase “Margaret Hall"
and associated it with his new partner.
As the evening wore on, he introduced
his partner to all his friends as Mar.
garet Hall, and, since the girl said
nothing, naturally presumed the name
was correct.

Think, then, oi his consternation
when he was informed hours later that

satisfactory considering the handi.

To leave the local campus for the
moment, we notice with surprise and
considerable envy the variety of sports
adtivnties mentioned on the sports
page of a recent copy of The Daily

The Oklahoma Aggics, who
have been taking it on the chin in
close contests so frequently that
its almost becoming a habit, have
run down the inuncdiate cause of
at least one of their discouraging
defeats. A couple of weeks ago,
between halves of the Washhurn
games which thcy lost 26.25, they
caught the Ichabods passing lrom
man to man a "lucky" half dollar
which dated back to the time of
the Columbian exposition. That

Creighton Coach
Drives Charges
for Grinnell Tilt

OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 12 (Special)~
With his two star performers on the
injured list, Coach A. A. Sehabinger
gave his Creighton university Blue.
'ays a rest Monday night but promised
hard rehearsals during thc remainder
of the week in preparation for the im.
portant game with Grinnell college
here, Saturday night.

Emil “Box" Engelbretson. le'idjng
scorer in the Missouri Valley con.
lei-once, was nursing an elbow ini
ed in weekend games with Washing.
ton and Washburn and George Busch,
star guard, was hobbled by weak ankles.
Both, however, are exneted to be in
top form for the crucial game.

Grinnell’s trail—blazers have headed
the conference standings since the be.
ginning of the season and a victory
for Creighton would give the Elueiays
a tie for the top rung with (he Pioneers.
The Hilltoppers enjoyed that standing
for a brief period last week but were
shoved into second place by Washing—
ton’s 26 to 23 victory Friday night.

Creighton has an early season 32
to 29 victory over Grinllell and is con.
ceded an even chance to administer a
second drubbing. Spectacular play
by the Pioneers rescues them from an
under.dog rating. As one sports writ.
er remarked, ‘There aren‘t any under.

The attitude of the college toward

education was the acquisition of know.
