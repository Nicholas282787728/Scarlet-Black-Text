New Cage Rules

“’1'” Not Change
Grinnell’s Plays

“The new rule restricting the pivot.
man under the basket will not eiiect
the Grinnell style of play," stated
Coach J. C. Truesdale, basketball men.
tor, Thursday attemoon while he was
putting his 15 spring basketball re.
cruits through the paces.

“The rule," added Truesdale, “states
that 'no offensive man shall remain
in the free throw lane over three sec.
ands under penalty of held ball’ was
designed primarily against learns us.
ing tall centers who slow up the game

by holding the hall and dominating the -

post position under the basket."

Grinnell Style Unchanged

He explained that since Grinnell
has never had a big pivot man, the
rule did not cripple the Grinnell style.
Another new rule is the abolition of
the center-jump after every success.
lul free throw, the ball being put
in play irom out oi bounds by the
team scored upon.

"The new rules," said Truesdale.
“will probably open up the game,
since the pivot man rule will leave the
free throw lane open tor cuts to.
ward the goal, and putting the ball
in play irom outside aiter successtul

. free throws will result in fast breaks."

Dramatization

as ‘Extraordinary Characterization’

“The Royal House" Given
in Clear Manner
by Reader

By ROBERT M. BROWN

With extraordinary Clarity and
and characterization. May.Floyd Sincx
ex '36, now taking dramatic work at
McClean college in Chicago, interpret.
ed all 16 characters of “The RDya]
Family.” She lost none of the wit and
Character that George S. Kaufman and
Edna Ferbor put into the play, and
at no time did the audience have to
guess at what was happening; nor did
they have to wonder which of the
Characters was speaking.

lt is very diliicult for a monodl‘am-
atist to sustain the interest and bus.
pensc of Lhc cnlirc audience through.
out the length at a play. th Miss
Smex did this very thing, cleverly and
with no apparent eticrt. It the aud.

and more than once held them in

Ditiicult Reading

it at times the play seems rather
long and the positions oi the char.
acters not quite clear, these iaults
were forgotten in admiration tor such
a young artist reading a ditticult play
with all the emotion and sincerity in.
tended by the authors. Ii pinned
down to one or two Constructive criti.
cisms, I think I would say that the
play could possibly have been cut
more judiciously than it was, It is
a diliicult undertaking tor one person
to read sixteen characters, and I tool
that it some of these characters had
been left out entirely, the artistwould
have gained and not lost. . At times
i was not absoluely sure oi the pos.
itions of some of the characters, but
this fault was overlooked in admira.
tion tor a person playing in lront of
a curtain drop and making me sec,
not thc curtains, but “the duplex
apartment of the Cavclldisll'b." Some
day ! should likc to see Miss Sirle
play Julie Cavcndislr, which was
without doubt her best characteriza—
tion of the evening.

Vote of thanks and apreciation to May.
