McDonald, Peck
to Give Recital
Friday Night

Sarah Inncss MacDonald, pianist,
and David E, Peelt, violinist, will
be heard in a recital of three son—
atas Friday evening at 7:30 o'clock
at Her ck chapel. The sonatas
were-written by Beethoven, Grieg
and Franck.

The first sonata on the program
will be one in A minor, op. 23, by
Beethoven. The first two mover
merits of this sonata were corn-
posed in 1800 and the entire sona-
ta was first published in 1501.
Beethoven ivrote, in all,‘tcn sona-
tas for the violin and piano, and
while this particular sonata is one
of the lesser known, at the samel
time it is one that is very lntci ,
ilig, It has three movement the
i, Presto; the second marked
“Andante selrcr oso, piu Allegi‘etr
to“ is 'a combination of the usual
schcrzo and slow movements of
the sonata. The final movement is
an “Allegro molLo.”

 

 

 

Sonam by Grieg:

The second sonata to be played
is by the Norwegian, Edvard
Grieg, who did much to develop a
Norwegian national style. Grieg's
music owes much of its success to
the skill with which he has adapt-
ed the classical structure to themes

so nearly allied to actual tradie
tional tunes as to be hardly dis-
tinguishable from genuine folk-

music.

The Grieg sonata which has
been chosen for this program,,is
the one in G, op, 13, The first
movement opens with a slow, sad
introduction (Lento doloroso),
which very shortly moves into a
somewhat brighter atmosphere of
six measures, which, in turn, leads
directly into an allegro vivace in
three-quarter rhythm very remi-
niscent of the Norwegian dance.
The second movement, Allegretto
tranquillo, is made up of an inter-
change of beautiful song melody
with a more spirited theme. The
last movement, Allegm animato,
begins with the three-quarters
rhythm. In the entire sonata the
element of the folk music is pres
dominant.

composition by Franck

The third, sonata is the only
composition of this ltind that Ce-
sar Franck wrote and for many
years was considered to he alto~
gether too modern to be under-
stood. Nowadays, however, it is
considered to be one of the finest
of. compositions of this particular
type of music literature

The sonata, in A major for vio-
lin and piano, has a good deal in
common with his other large ill~
strumental essays. Its movements
have thematic linlts and it hrealts
away from the traditional sonata
form in other respects. Its princi-
pal movement comes second, the

first being a quiet preamble "allee

gretto beii moderate" Instead of

the usual adagio or andante, it is -

a "Recitativo-Fantasia," and the
finale, "allegretto pace masso,”
a kind of mndol »
