THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Western Alumni
to Hear Nollen

Later in Month ,

During the second half '0! March,
President John s. Nollcn will make an
extended speaking and contact tour
among the Grinnell alumni of the L05
Angeles and San Francisco areas. This
trip. like the one in February through
the cast, will be lor the purpose of
organizing the Grinnell alumni into a
more coiiipaet and unified group

“in the past the organization among
the Grinnellians has been very loose,"
Pr out Nollcn says “It has mainly
consisted at local groups which met
once or twice a year, usually when a
traveling representative oi the college
was in that vicinity. The new organi.
zation will serve to coordinate these
various, heretofore disorganized
groups."

The plan is to set up committees in
each group to deal with alumni or.
ganization, alumni relations with Grin.
nell. and with the new student move.
ment, These committees will also help
with the ﬁnances of the college, and
with the placement of Gi-innell stu.
dents or recent graduates who desire
to secure or change Jobs.

During his recent speaking and or.
ganizing tour throughout the east,
President Nollen addressed meetings
of the Grinnell alumni at Washington,
Philadelphia, New York. Boston,
Cleveland, and Detroit. The largest
meetings were at New York and Wash.
