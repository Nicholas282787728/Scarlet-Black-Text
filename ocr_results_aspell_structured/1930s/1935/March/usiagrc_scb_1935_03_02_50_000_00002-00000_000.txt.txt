ANOTHER SEASON GONE.

Drake won a share in a Valley title last night,
Grinnell lost out on the same, and there is no need
for alibi-mg on the matter; but to most of the Grin-
nell fans the game was most impressive in the way
it emphasized the handicap which the Pioneers are
required to overcome when playing their outsof-
town games on the large ﬂoors which the other
conference teams boast. It also suggested the dif—
ficulty which visiting teams must experience in
adjusting their play to the Grinnell “cracker box."

Of course the college cannot rush out and
build a new field house just because unfamiliarity
with a large playing ﬂoor has contributed to the
Pioneers’ loss of an athletic title; but the team’s

_ supporters may now better realize what odds the
players are up against when called upon to face a
lightning-fast quintet, such as Drake possessed,
on a floor whose size places a premium on fast
breaking.

Having“ no opportunity to construct a defense
to adequately guard as much territory as they
were required to defend last night, the Grinnell
five was at a loss to stop the sprinting Bulldogs;
even the Pioneer offense contributed to the team’s
downfall,‘ since it was built for the small Grinnell
floor and did not provide for sufficiently fast for»
mation of a defense on a long court such as
Drake‘s.

All this rationalizing is not intended to de—
tract from the Bulldogs’ credit or as an apology,
for the Grinnell team, as the first would be his
deed unfair and the latter is entirely unnecessary,
Drake’s was, without argument, the superior team
last night; but it is none the less true, regardless

of the Pioneers’ defeat, that Coach Truesdale pro»
duced this year the best Grinnell team in more
than a decade.

So here’s to the Pioneers at 1935. Though
they lost a title, they won the respect of every
team in the conference and produced a record of
which we may justly be proud.

FOLLOWING CHICAGO’S LEAD

Four years ago Chicago university embarked
upon a new educational experiment which was
regarded somewhat skeptically by many educa—
tors but with Very great interest by all. From
its avowed purpose it was obvious that the syc-
tern was intended to depart far from the commons
ly accepted academic methods—it proposed not
simply to provide its students with an education,
but to make of them ”self-governing, responsible
persons equipped with initiative and with sound
habits of controlling their own lives.” '

That the experiment has not proved a failure
is manifest in the fact that Chicago has attained
a position of high respect in the eyes of educa-
tors the world over. in a report by investiga-
tors for the Julius Rosenwald foundation this fall
the university was ranked as the third finest edu-
cational institution in the nation, surpassed in ex»
cellence only by Harvard and Columbia. This
in itself was a signal honor, but even more to its
credit was the assertion that the entire middle
west has profited by Chicago’s leadership, and the
fact that four other institutons among the first
12 ranked were from this section of the country
reflects glory to its initiative as well as to that of
the honored schools; for it is undeniable that the
trend in the middle 'west toward developmen; of

‘Student initiative and placing a premium on in-

dependent study has had its source in the Chicago
experiment.

Here at Grinnell the influence of Chicago’s

leadership is evident, as in scores of other mid-

western institutions. While not taken precisely
from the Chicago system, the introduction here
at Grinnell of the comprehensive examinations
for the seniors had behind it practically the same
purpose as that which inspired the new educa-
tional departures at Chicago.

The Chicago officials, however, sought to
lessen the emphasis placed upon periodical qu
es and class attendance and atiach gl'cater im»
portance to individual study and CDmpTBllellEl '
examinations, to be taken when the student feels
himself adequately prepared. Grinnell has not

seen fit to follow Chicago’s lead in this respect.

It is rumored on the campus that the faculty
is considering a new “cut” rule, which would give
to students receiving A or B averages in all cours-
es during a semester, unlimited “cuts” during
the ensuing term. We feel that to adopt this rul-
ing would be entirely in accord with the spirit
sought by introduction of the senior comprehen-
sives and for some years evidenced in the honors
work offered exceptional students to encourage
individual study in their major fields. Certainly
Chicago has not injured its educational standing
by permitting optional class attendance; and it is
very doubtful if officials of Grinnell college would
argue that the average Grinnell student is so in~
ferior to the average Chicagoan that the reverse
might be expected here.

With the grade provision to restrict the up
tional “cut” privilege to the better students, it
seems that there could be little loss by at least
giving the plan a trial. If the aim at Grinnell,
too, is to develop the student's initiative and sense
of responsibility, coercive class attendance is
hardly in accord with that aim.

There is a wrestler at the Univer.
sity of Minnesota who is going to
amount to something some day.

He was consigned to the college
hospital for measles a few days
before a big wrestling meet. As
the day drew near the boy grew more
fidgcty, afraid he would be in poor
shape, even if he got out of his ward
in time, So one morning he locked the
door of the mrd, hauled other measle.

right, and was released in time for
